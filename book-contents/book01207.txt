Anyone can change 
the past, if he can 
reach it. But he’d bet- 
ter be careful how 



The truly terrifying thing 
about imprisonment was the loneli- 
ness. 

Silverthome’s captors treated him 
with neither kindness nor unkind- 
ness, neither respect nor disrespect. 
Their detachment made his ex- 
istence pointless, his confinement 
inhuman, as if he were already 
dead. In a sense this was true; he 
was buried — and far better dead. 
But even the solace of oblivion was 
denied him. 

Stolid guards delivered and re- 
trieved thrice-daily meals, rarely ut- 
tering a single syllable since few, if 
any, knew French or German. And 
certainly not the archaic peasant 
tongue once known as English. 
Each day at mid-afternoon he was 
escorted from the cell to an exercise 
cubicle hewn from living rock. He 
shuffled to and fro and did simple 
calisthenics while guards armed 
with sub-machine guns idled in the 
granite archway. Even then he was 
taken down a side passageway; he 
saw no other prisoners. Ever. 

The days dragged by in sunless 
isolation — hopeless days strung to- 
gether end-to-end to form empty 
months, vacuous years. James Sil- 

MEMO TO THE LEADER 



verthome had time — all the time 
there was — to examine the cir- 
cumstances that had precipitated the 
Great Mistake. Everlastingly, ellipti- 
cally, he relived the complex events 
leading to the brink, second- 
guessing his part in them, then 
second-guessing his second-guessing 
until eventually the riddle had 
neither beginning nor end and the 
reflexive second-guessing cr6wded 
his mind full circle in shadowy 
labyrinths. 

Perhpas if he had firmly refused 
to go, had simply said “No!” to 
Bernard Omsley on that fateful 
night, it might have sufficed. 

Perhaps not. 

For the night Omsley dropped by 
had made a beginning .... 

★ * * 

At precisely seven o’clock on a 
cool September evening in 
Deutsches Weltanreichsjahr 142 — 
more properly 2075, remembering 
the Gregorian calendar — while carv- 
ing roast lamb and chatting with his 
guests, the Gauleiter of Greater Den- 
ver and Frau K'astner, Professor 
James Sil verthome was startled to 
hear an aircar touch down gently on 
the roof park of his mountain villa. 

A chill crawled between his 
shoulder blades for he knew without 
considering the matter who it was. 
Why in God's name had Bernard 
chosen this particular moment to 
pay a surprise call? 

Gauleiter K'astner seemed oblivi- 

5 



ous to the barely audible thump 
overhead though Silverthome’s 
wife, Emily, shot James a wary 
glance over the rim of her wine- 
glass. Careful to make no outward 
sign of awareness, Silverthome con- 
tinued his anecdote — a tidbit of 
Sans Souci bedroom intrigue gar- 
nered during a recent junket to the 
court of Frederick the Great — with 
all the nonchalance he could mus- 
ter. At the first opportunity, Emily 
excused herself and went into the 
kitchen. 

“Simply fascinating,” said K'ast- 
ner, clicking his tongue. “You are 
singularly fortunate to have actually 
walked the earth during such a rich 
era. We shall expect a book about 
Friedrich, no?” 

“I’m anxious to begin it,” said 
Silverthome, covertly studying the 
other’s manner. The Gauleiter 
seemed relaxed, little resembling 
the vain, thoroughly Americanized 
ogre who gave audience in that 
pompously furnished office over- 
looking the old Denver Civic 
Center — now Erwin Rommel Platz 
— with its Wajfen SS shrine where 
larger-than-life bronze figures of 
Sepp Dietrich and Jochen Peiper 
pondered some eternal battlefield 
from beside the ugly, eighty-eight 
millimeter snout of a King Tiger 
tank’s gun turret. 

Although he detested the corpu- 
lent official, Silverthome’s chair of 
Temporal Research at Goebbels In- 
stitut, as well as the revolutionary 
conspiracy in which he was deeply 



embroiled, demanded that he and 
Emily entertain the Kastners on oc- 
casion. James had met but a handful 
of Herrenvolk in his thirty-seven 
years; most had been political 
nulls — scholars and educators like 
himself — not German-bom aristo- 
crats of K'astner’s stamp. The Gaulei- 
ter embodied the casual arrogance 
of a Berliner bom and bred. But his 
pedigree was tainted; Silverthome 
had reason to suspect the Heidel- 
berg scar disfiguring the tyrant’s 
jowl was a product of in-party 
surgery rather than a dueling sabre’s 
mark of honor. 

Emily returned, offering a 
lackluster smile. “Bernard is here,” 
she said in an uncertain voice. 

The older educator trailed her, his 
manner frankly embarrassed. “For- 
give the intrusion,” he said, stand- 
ing in the doorway. “I should have 
called first. I had no idea you’d be 
entertaining guests. I’ve, uh, rather 
important news . both sorts.” 

“Always delighted to see you, 
Bernard. Come have some wine. I 
believe you already know Herr 
Doktor und Frau Kastner. ’ ’ 

Acknowledging Omsley’s bow 
with a tip of his head, the Gualeiter 
smiled only with his lips. “Say, I 
thought I heard someone land a 
moment ago! How are things at the 
Institut? Herr Omsley heads the 
History Department,” he reminded 
his wife, “as well as our Temporal 
Research Program.” 

Frau Kastner nodded, looking 
vaguely suspicious.

GALAXY 




“The department practically runs 
itself, sir. The, er, reason I’ve 
bothered you ...” Omsley hesi- 
tated. “Jamie, I’m sorry to have to 
tell you our petition has been denied 
by Reichskounzel. You won’t be al- 
lowed to go back and visit the War 
Years after all.” 

Silverthome cringed inside him- 
self. “That’s . definite?” 

“I’m afraid so.” 

Struggling to mask his disap- 
pointment, James said, “You men- 
tioned you had both sorts of news, 
Bernard?’ ’ 

Omsley brightened. “Yes. The 
thorium expenditure for your long 
jump to Augustan Rome has been 
sanctioned,” he said. “ Arminium , 
the battle of Teutoberger Wald, the 
birth of Germanic — ” 

“Hermann,” corrected the Gau- 
leiter vehemently, “not ‘Ar- 
minius’l ‘Arminius' once signified 
the Latinized, mongrelized bar- 
barian who belonged to Rome. Her- 
mann der Cherusca was the hero’s 
proper name. He realized the folly 
of his allegiance to Rome, returned 
to the Cherusci and led them to bril- 
liant victory over Varus and three 
entire legions. There is a vast dif- 
ference.” 

“ Natiirlich , Herr Gauleiter.” 
Omsley looked contrite. 

Kastner barked a hearty laugh. 
“Here am I,” he said, patting his 
wife’s hand, “lecturing a pair of 
famous history professors. Doesn’t 
that strike you as droll, my dear?” 

Frau Kastner managed a 



perplexed nod as the corpulent 
Gauleiter put down his glass — his 
fifth serving of California Gewiirtz 
Traminer — and rose with difficulty, 
fiddling with the handle of the SS 
dagger at his belt. “Jamie,” he said 
expansively, “you must understand 
something. Your remarkable career 
in temporal research has not gone 
unnoticed by the Reich’s heirarchy 
nor, I might add, has it gone unre- 
warded. But the policy of allowing 
only selected German-bom party 
members to revisit the War Years is 
quite firm. I can’t imagine what 
prompted you to bother petitioning 
Reichskounzel. There was no 
hope — never.” 

“I suppose that’s difficult for me 
to understand, sir.” James lifted his 
hands in frustration. “History is my 
lifework. Not to be allowed to prac- 
tice it in the field is — ” 

“Ah, but we must be realistic.” 
The Gauleiter stamped his foot in 
vexation. “The young Reich was in 
dire straits when Dr. Lebe was cap- 
tured. The so-called Allies had been 
forewarned of secret weapons — 
rockets, atomic bombs, that sort of 
thing — never in their wildest im- 
aginings suspecting a ‘secret 
weapon’ like the Lebe Technique. 
Complacent in victory, they allowed 
Erich Lebe to return from his Soviet 
nightmare to a conquered, plun- 
dered, sundered Germany. 

“I shan’t bore you by retelling 
the saga — the achievements of 
dedicated geniuses who labored 
twenty-eight years perfecting the 



MEMO TO THE LEADER

mechanics of temporal displace- 
ment, Franz Lustmann’s heroic 
probe of the unknown that shaped 
our modern world. That, gentlemen, 
is history!” 

K'astner smacked his lips, 
savoring the moment. ‘‘The 
Reichsfuhrer, Reichsleiter and 
Reichskounzel are forsworn to guard 
the immutability of that history. 
Quite understandable, is it not? 
Safeguarding the doorway to the 
past is a sacred responsibility.” 

“You’re correct, of course, Herr 
Gauleiter,” said Silverthome. 
“Though it’s galling not to be 
trusted.” 

“Trust?” Kastner huffed with 
self-importance. “Some things, my 
dear Silverthome, are too important 
to entrust to any individual. We go 
back into our past only to learn — 
never to touch, disturb or mutilate. 
The reflexive dangers of promiscu- 
ous time travel would be over- 
whelming.” 

Trying hard to look impressed, 
Omsley coughed politely into his 
cupped hand. “An absolutely sound 
policy, sir. Let me apologize once 
again for intruding. I really should 
be running along.” 

“Not at all, Omsley.” The offi- 
cial waved airily and sat down to re- 
sume his assault on Silverthome’s 
wine rack. “Let us know the details 
of your projects from time to time, 
eh?” 

“Thank you, sir. I shall.” 

“I’ll walk you to your aircar, 
Bernard.” Silverthome bowed to- 



ward the K'astners. “Will you ex- 
cuse us?” 

* * * 

They rode upward in the lift, not 
speaking as if by mutual agreement. 
Stepping outdoors on the roofpark, 
they could see the outskirts of 
Greater Denver Gauleitung forming 
a sprinkle of lights northward while 
the Rampart Range reared stark and 
rugged against the azure Colorado 
twilight. 

James Silverthome was scowling. 
“That tears it!” he said. “I suppose 
there’s no way to appeal 
Reichskounzel’ s decision.” 

Omsley’s low-voiced response 
amazed him. “You’re going.” 
“What? But you told me — ” 
“Shush-h-h! You’ll go exactly as 
planned,” said the older man, 
“with one glaring difference — 
forget about leaving from the 
Carlsbad Caverns site. Faking a 
Roman time-jump would never 
work. Their bloodhounds would 
sniff out the variance in energy ex- 
pended on a shorter junket. You’ll 
be going from orbit. Temporal dis- 
placement of a double will make the 
figures balance at Carlsbad.” 
“Orbit? It’s that desperate?” 
“Desperate indeed!” Omsley 
slowed his walk, looking directly 
into Silverthome’s eyes. When he 
spoke, his tone was soft, biting. 
“Jamie, this Reich of theirs makes 
medieval feudalism look downright 
permissive by comparison. It’s noth-

ing but monolithic, iron-handed 
domination of the entire globe and 
every human being on it. You must 
go back, you must succeed. Powell 
volunteered to double for you at last 
night’s cell meeting.” 

Silverthome’s mind was racing. 
“Bernard, how in hell do I get into 
orbit? Or down, for that matter?” 
“Henderson has developed an ab- 
lative pressure suit,” explained 
Omsley. “You’ll be put aboard a 
shuttle to Walkiire Space Station, 
posing as a purser. Good thing your 
German’s excellent.” 

“Whew! You’re scaring me, 
Bernard. Not certain I can be ex- 
pected to do acrobatics or — ” 

“We haven’t much time,” said 
Omsley, paying no heed to Silver- 
thorne’s objections. “Sicherheits- 
dienst and Gestapo are both close 
behind us. Graham was picked up 
night before last. They’ve broken 
three other high-ranked cells dur- 
ing as many months. That’s why 
I barged in this evening under Tub- 
by’s nose. Our charade may lull his 
suspicions.” 

“Um, maybe. I wouldn’t count 
on it. You were saying . ?” 

“The temporal device is already 
aboard Walkiire ,” pursued the 
other. “The necessary few grams of 
thorium isotope are in a conveni- 
ence locker, waiting for you. I 
won’t tell you how many lives that 
thorium cost us. But your jump’s 
short, Jamie — less than a century 
and a half. Henny has it all ar- 
ranged.” 



“And I’ll come down where? 
More important, when?” 

Omsley pursed his lips. “Central 
Europe is all Henderson can prom- 
ise, sometime between February 
and June, nineteen forty.” 

“Forty? Sounds a bit premature 
to me. We’ve no way of being cer- 
tain?” 

“None,” said Bernard Omsley. 
“Arguments have raged for decades 
over whether to aim for a later or 
an earlier period in the War. The 
answer lies somewhere in their ar- 
chives, for all the good that does. 
We have Goebbels’ pretentious 
tomes, plus the works of those other 
Nazi bores. How much is true? 
Your guess is as valid as anyone’s. 

“The alliances with Italy and 
Japan can probably be taken for 
granted. Recovering the Sudeten- 
land, annexing Austria, swallowing 
Czechoslovakia and overrunning Po- 
land all seem likely. But that light- 
ning strike through the Ardennes, the 
quick collapse of the low countries 
and France, sound too pat. 

“Then we are told England lost 
an entire army on the beach at 
Dunkirk, that the Wehrmacht won a 
glorious triumph over British shore 
defenses in the Sea Lion channel 
crossing, consolidated the western 
territories for a year, then turned 
eastward, violating the Soviet Pact, 
and decimated Byelorussia and the 
Ukraine. Kiev, Kharkov, Stalingrad 
and Leningrad were devastated. 
Moscow was totally obliterated 
from the air. Victory piled upon 



MEMO TO THE LEADER

victory! Who can believe. 

“Their . ‘history’ is damned 
hard to swallow.” 

“An understatement, Jamie.” 
Omsley turned his back to the 
breeze, cupping his hands to light a 
cigarette. “But who can argue with 
films of Rommel’s Panzers rolling 
through Alexandria to the Suez, of 
flaming American B-36’s that braved 
the Atlantic to thrust at Germany’s 
heartland, or the V-4 rocket strikes 
on New York, Chicago, even Los 
Angeles? 

“And the final duplicities after 
President Dewey’s capitulation — 
Nazi atomic warheads raining on 
Nagasaki and Tokyo-Yokohama, 
with once-proud Italy a vassal 
state.” 

James Silverthome shivered 
slightly although the night was 
mild. “And I’m supposed to change 
all that, single-handed? How?” 

“You’ll have to play it by ear, 
Jamie. No one ever said it would be 
easy. You and your talents are 
probably our single remaining 
trump. We must play it now, how- 
ever long the odds, or possibly re- 
linquish it forever and make their 
Tausendjahr Reich a reality. You 
must admit they’ve made one hel- 
luva start!” 

Silverthome’s eyes narrowed. “I 
think Kastner was teasing us 
downstairs,” he said slowly. “He 
said something about a ‘sundered’ 
Germany. Wonder what he could’ve 
meant by that. Bernard, this whole 
scheme is crazy! Franz Lustmann 



went back and reshuffled the deck, 
altered the outcome of the War. I’ll 
wager that fat slug downstairs 
knows precisely how it was done.” 

Omsley shrugged. “Undoubtedly. 
But don’t waste your hatred on 
Tubby. He’s the most completely 
Americanized Gauleiter in the coun- 
try. Warring cultures collide, Jamie. 
Neither the victors nor the van- 
quished escape unchanged. You’ll 
have to admit Kastner has been a 
valuable asset, if you want to be ob- 
jective about it. 

“The vital thing to remember is 
this — Lustmann ’s venture was suc- 
cessful. If it can be done once, it 
can be done again.” 

“Can it?” objected Silverthome 
with no little sarcasm. “Lustmann 
returned carrying encyclopedic data 
about the real War. He faced a 
monumental task, granted. But 
compared to mine, it was — ” 

“I know, I know,” said Omsley 
quickly. “But it isn’t hopeless. 
Lustmann’s a demi-god in their 
pantheon, a world hero. Every 
schoolchild in five continents learns 
to venerate that face. We’ve made a 
fair inference where he went and 
approximately when.” 

Silverthome groaned. “Bernard, 
he was somewhere in Europe some- 
time between nineteen thirty-three 
and nineteen fifty. It will be much, 
much worse than searching for the 
proverbial needle. And if I should 
find him — ” 

“He was in Berlin,” snapped 
Omsley, “about the middle of nine- 



10 



GALAXY 




teen forty. We’re staking everything 
on that fact and you’d better accus- 
tom yourself to believing it.” 

Silverthome’s grunt was non- 
commital. 

“Sorry,” said the other with a 
sigh. “Let me finish. We’ve 
rounded together every authentic 
twentieth-century Reichsmark we 
could beg, borrow or pilger. It 
comes to only a few thousand but 
that’s enough to keep you from 
starving until you can steal — or 
earn — some more. There’s a little 
jewelry too and papers presenting 
you as an Austrian or Italian free- 
lance correspondent. Select the most 
appropriate when you ground, then 
burn the other papers. 

“Henderson has made provision 
for two hundred and twenty pounds 
of transposable mass — you and ev- 
erything inside your p-suit, includ- 
ing Lederhosen and a rucksack. 
Pass yourself off as a goldbrick hik- 
ing about on a Wanderjahr until 
you atemporize. And I want you 
to spend lots of extra time on that. 
You spent mere days before getting 
to work in eighteenth-century 
Potsdam. But that was only re- 
search. This jump is for keeps!” 

Omsley stepped on his cigarette, 
then opened the hatch of his 
seven-place aircar. He held out his 
hand. “Hals und Beinbruchl” 

Silverthome stood with the breeze 
tousling his hair, shaking his col- 
league’s hand. He felt enormous 
apprehension. “Sounds like I may 
break my fool neck as well,” he 



said. “Are you going to Carlsbad 
with Powell?” 

Omsley ’s nod was curt. “In the 
morning. We hope to get him off 
by nightfall. Henderson’s man will 
collect you about noon, take you 
over to Raketenflugplatz and see 
you aboard the shuttle. Be ready, 
Jamie. We’re counting on you.” 
Silverthome’s head bobbed 
woodenly. “I’ll be waiting. Luck!” 
“And to you, Jamie. I expect 
we’ll both need all we can get.” 
Silverthome stepped back as 
Omsley lighted the glowcoils and 
wound up the first-state turbines. 
The engines caught, continued their 
octave-by-octave climbing whine. 
With a sharp premonition of final- 
ity, he watched the aircar vector 
away into the darkness. 

Downstairs, when the lift door 
opened, he constructed an ingratiat- 
ing smile for the wine-swilling 
Gauleiter and his lumpish woman, 
discovering that his appetite had 
fled. 

★ * ★ 

“Braun, you slow-witted slug- 
gard! We dock in ten minutes. I 
want that freight manifest recon- 
ciled. You hear?” 

Suppressing a curse, Purser 
Braun-Silverthome flung aside the 
squeezebottle of coffee. “ Jawohl , 
Herr Dries. ” He hooked a belt ring 
to the aft-going safety line per regu- 
lations and pulled himself smartly 
down the companion way, fuming.

Neither Omsley nor Henderson’s 
man had bothered to tell him that 
the chief purser — a loudmouthed 
bully with a natural bent for tor- 
menting underlings — was not privy 
to the conspiracy. The chief purser 
had made Silverthome’s life miser- 
able ever since liftoff. 

He groped his way into “G” 
cargo hold, hating weightlessness 
and its uncertainties. He had also 
learned to despise the close confines 
and unappetizing smells of the 
earth-to-orbit shuttle Mecklenburg. 
The shuttle would be maneuvering 
to dock with Walkiire Space Sta- 
tion at any instant and he wondered 
if he would be able to hear the ac- 
celeration warning while floating 
about down below in the craft’s 
bowels. 

Silverthome made a wry face and 
searched out the nearest convenient 
handhold, then began checking off 
numbered cargo modules against a 
manifest. Emily was in his 
thoughts. She had not been easy to 
deceive; she knew him too well. 
There had been no safe way to tell 
her the truth, of course. They had 
kissed good-bye on the roofpark in 
the blaze of noon, she believing 
him bound on a research junket to 
Augustan Rome. Hazardous, yes, 
but he had convinced her (as he al- 
ways managed to do) that the exper- 
ience he had acquired in visiting 
one era or another tended to lessen 
the manifold dangers involved. 
Emily had gone along, as was her 
customary pretense. She knew that 



he never took chances on any junket 
and that he was even more careful 
in antiquity. 

The sly grate of the opening 
hatch made Silverthome pause. That 
devil of a chief purser again, no 
doubt, sneaking around looking for 
an excuse to make life even more 
hellish. Well, this time the bastard 
would find Purser Braun hard at 
work. 

A rumbling voice behind him 
said, “Jamie.” 

Silverthome whipped himself 
about. “Henderson?” The red- 
haired man had grown a wispy au- 
burn beard since their last en- 
counter. He was carrying a medical 
valise and seemed to be in a hurry. 
“What the hell are you doing 
aboard?’ ’ 

Henderson closed and battened 
the hatch before answering. “Lost 
your taste for blondes, Professor? 
Or maybe you didn’t notice that 
platinum witch making eyes at you 
just after liftoff.” 

“I . no. Was I supposed to?” 
The other’s grin was fleet, wolf- 
ish. “Anyone who’s still warm 
would notice Helga. We were trying 
to get you aside and cue you, 
Jamie. The scheme has gone sour. 
Looks like we’re in a footrace.” 
Silverthome’s throat constricted. 
“To ... get me off?” 

“Right. We’re still in the ball 
game but it will be touch and go.” 
Henderson snapped open the black 
bag. “Here,” he directed, “doff 
that silly uniform and put these 



12 



GALAXY 




on.” He held out shorts and a sin- 
glet. “You’re becoming a pas- 
senger — a cardiac patient bound 
for Luna. Helga’s going to be your 
nurse.” 

Silverthome glanced anxiously 
toward the hatch. “Henny, the chief 
purser is liable to poke his nose in 
here and — ” 

“Uh-uh,” Henderson interrupted. 
“The chief purser got kind of 
sleepy a while ago. He won’t bother 
anyone for hours. Hurry! We want 
to be ready when this bucket mates 
with the station.” 

A warning klaxon groaned dis- 
tantly, catching Silverthome dres- 
sing. Awkwardly he followed Hen- 
derson to a stanchion rising from 
among the stacked and shackled 
cargo modules. Both men seized 
handholds; a mild surge of weight 
and the conducted thunder of thrus- 
ters came and went. There was 
another brief burst, then a mild jar. 
A sighing chuff of air announced 
the shuttle’s docking. 

“Relax a minute,” said Hender- 
son, “ ’till the passengers begin to 
disembark. Helga has some medical 
stage props waiting inboard. Be 
sure to let me tow you up into the 
freefall rigging — and make it look 
good, real good.” 

The transverse companionway 
leading inboard from the working 
decks was deserted and they en- 
countered no one until entering the 
main passageway. Silverthome let 
“Doctor” Henderson precede him, 
pulling himself hand-over-hand 



along the line toward the airlock. 

Suddenly Henderson checked 
himself. He yawed about, tight- 
lipped. “Look behind me,” he 
said. “What do you see?” 

Silverthome peered over Hender- 
son’s shoulder toward the lock 
chamber that interfaced the shuttle 
and Walkilre Space Station. Three 
men and a blonde nurse were float- 
ing near the freefall rigging that was 
now aswarm with off-loading 
passengers. One of the men casually 
held the pretty nurse’s arm. “Hel- 
ga’s been scragged.” 

“Damn.” Henderson doubled his 
fists. “Last of the ninth, one out 
and no one on base. All we can do 
is sacrifice. Now listen, and listen 
good, Professor. Omsley and Pow- 
ell were picked up this morning at 
Carlsbad. Powell suicided but Ber- 
nard . don’t suppose you knew 
but Bernard’s a Catholic.” 

“I . no, I didn’t know. He’ll 
be made to talk.” 

“Yeah. If he hasn’t already.” 
Henderson swore bitterly. “They 
were at your home about three 
hours before this bucket lifted off. 
That’s why I came along. We got 
Emily safely underground so don’t 
fret about her. But I’m afraid they 
got a good fix on me. I had to ven- 
tilate one of ’em to get away.” 

“I . I’ll never be able to thank 
you, Henny!” 

“So don’t try. Now stamp this in 
your memory. The thorium is in 
locker 429, third tier to the left, in 
the transient passengers’ lounge. 



MEMO TO THE LEADER 



13 




Here’s the key. Take the thorium 
down to the nadir stack — we’re in a 
zenith berth here — and look up a 
maintenance tech named Faigele. 
Tell him a dirty joke so’s he’ll 
know who you are. He’ll get your 
p-suit, thruster bottle and other gear 
and show you which airlock to use. 
Wearing your false tooth?” 

Silverthome nodded. 

‘‘Okay, here’s your return ticket. 
It’s pre-tuned.” Henderson rum- 
maged in the valise and passed over 
a small capsule. “Just like on all 
your other trips, Professor. Twist 
the tooth to the right and your ac- 
cumulated temporal potential will 
flex you back into Carlsbad’s recep- 
tor field like an unleashed rubber 
band.” 

Henderson’s lips worked as he 
felt for something deeper in the 
satchel. There was a barely audible 
click. The redhead smiled ruefully. 
“Guess this’s the way she falls out. 
Don’t feel bad. I’ve got some 
scores to settle.” 

Silverthome had seen the hastily 
wrapped dynamite sticks. He said 
nothing. 

“One more quick word,” said 
Henderson, “then you better scat 
before we begin to attract attention. 
They may call my bluff and shoot 
me straight off. I’ll try to buy you 
ten or fifteen minutes. 

“When you’re suited up and out- 
side, lower the reticle in your 
headpiece and center Polaris, then 
hit the red chin lever. Transfer in- 
jection will put you in a ninety- 

14 



four-mile perigee. You’re more or 
less phased in synch with earthspin, 
nineteen-forty — close as we could 
calculate, anyhow — and from what I 
saw during ascent boost, you should 
have about a half-hour wait until 
you see yourself coming up on 
Europe. 

“When the British Isles roll over 
the limb, turn one-eighty degrees to 
your line of flight and chin the yel- 
low lever. If there’s cloud cover, 
you’ll have to interpolate your posi- 
tion from whatever terrain you’re 
able to see. Okay?” 

“Got it.” 

Henderson grunted approval. 
“The retro sequence will kick hell 
out of you,” he warned. “You 
won’t mass much but you’ll have 
lots of kinetic. Then comes the heat 
wave, don’t let it scare you. An 
aneroid switch will trigger temporal 
transition at about thirteen thousand 
feet — take you right out of your 
p-suit — hopefully over Germany, 
Austria or Hungary. For Chrissakes, 
watch out for mountains! If you 
come down over the Alps, the 
Dolomites or whatever, you’ll have 
to do some fancy riser work to spill 
air and change direction. That could 
get sticky. Pop your chute as soon 
after transition as you get your bear- 
ings. Have all that?” 

“I think so, Henny.” 

“Great! Shake my mitt, Jamie, 
then beat it out the cargo hatch and 
don’t look back. Remember, we’re 
all betting on you!” 

Silverthome clasped Henderson’s 

GALAXY 




free hand, smiling gratefully al- 
though his eyes were misted. He 
whirled and tugged himself back 
along the freefall safety line. 

* * * 

He wended his way aft like an 
agile spider, near-colliding with a 
pair of crewmen who swore after 
him, not giving chase because they 
took him for a passenger. He snub- 
bed to a stop at the main 
passageway, burning his hands on 
the nylon line, and cautiously 
peeked around the comer. A long 
procession of slowly moving cargo 
modules was being conveyored 
through the deserted passageway 
and “up” into Walkiire Space Sta- 
tion. 

He jerked back his head. Two 
bland-faced Gestapo assassins were 
guarding the cargo hatch. 

Silverthome’s mind raced. Hen- 
derson had promised only minutes, 
several of which had already fled. It 
would be hopeless to try bluffing 
past two professionals. He hadn’t 
worked out in a freefall gym for 
years and his chances of physically 
handling one of them, not to men- 
tion the other, were close to nil. 

He stiffened, muttering, “Of 
course!” and pulled himself back 
down the passageway. Four steve- 
dores were emptying “D” hold, 
preparing to move the conveyor 
head into “E.” He prayed as he 
opened “G” compartment’s hatch. 



The prayer was answered; no one 
was there. 

He flew to the cargo stack, find- 
ing the purser’s uniform still wad- 
ded between two modules. He al- 
most tore it in pulling it on over the 
shorts and singlet. Then he 
smoothed his hair, donned the cap 
and was back in the passageway in 
seconds. 

Silverthome breathed deeply, re- 
hearsing the scene in his mind. 
How would it play best? Sincerity? 
No, not with Gestapo. His best bet 
might be to pretend willy-nilly, 
scatterbrained agitation — if he could 
summon the guts to pull it off. 

He rounded the comer and snub- 
bed, gave one long-armed tug to- 
ward the cargo hatch in the manner 
of an old spacehand and sailed 
blithely into the rigging. The net re- 
covered from the impetus of his 
plunge, going slack. He reached for 
an “upper” rung. 

“You seemed awfully rushed,” 
said the man in the gray jumpsuit. 
“May I have a look at your papers, 
bitteT ’ 

Silverthome glanced at the 
swastika-bordered Sicherheitsdienst 
medallion in the man’s open palm. 
Not Gestapo after all. These were 
SD — real pros! “Of course, sir.” 
He hooked an elbow through the 
rigging and tugged out his wallet. 

The SD man looked over the 
forged spaceman’s papers. “Braun, 
Wilhelm G.,” he said boredly. “He 
would seem to be a purser.” 

The man’s partner consulted a 



16 



GALAXY 




list. “Where were you bom?” 

“Dusseldorf, sir.” 

“Ah, yes. And why such a sweat 
to get inboard, Wilhelm?” 

‘Silverthome swallowed a lump. 
“I . there’s a young lady — a 
passenger.” He looked from one 
agent to the other. “You’ve never 
seen such a Schatzel I, er, must be 
back in fifteen minutes— the cargo, 
you know.” 

The man in the gray jumpsuit 
snickered unpleasantly, returning 
Silverthome’s wallet. “Don’t you 
know crewmen aren’t supposed to 
chase passengers, Braun? Oh, I 
suppose we can’t interfere with your 
love life, can we? Run along, 
though a quarter-hour tryst seems 
hardly worth the effort. Come back 
promptly or we’ll be looking for 
you. Versteh’s duT ’ 

“Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.” Sil- 
verthome swarmed “up” the rig- 
ging. Look for me in fifteen min- 
utes, you son-of-a-bitch, and you’ll 
have some search! 

He ducked into the first wash- 
room he encountered along the hub 
corridor, shucked the uniform in a 
booth, came out and stuffed it into 
a waste receptacle, then zipped 
along the freefall safety line toward 
the spin elevators. He encountered 
only a few stevedores and stray 
crewmen from the Mecklenburg, 
none of whom gave him a second 
glance. Beyond the interlock 
chamber connecting the berthing 
stack with the station proper, the 
area became more populated. 



He fidgeted during the intermina- 
ble wait while the elevator matched 
spin with the passenger terminal, 
underwent a momentary pang of 
coriolis-induced dizziness, then re- 
laxed as weight returned to his feet. 
Joining the stream of passengers 
shopping along the midway, he kept 
his head down, trying to make his 
haste inconspicious. He turned right 
into the large alcove adjacent ot the 
transient lounge, wishing he had 
time to reconnoiter before moving 
toward the locker. But seconds were 
dribbling away into precious min- 
utes. 

Silverthome pulled the key from 
the singlet’s slash pocket. Locker 
429 opened easily to reveal a small, 
innocent-looking cube of dark ma- 
terial. He remembered to breathe 
again, offering Omsley a heart-felt 
mental salute. Bernard had either 
managed to hold out or purposely 
refrained from learning the locker’s 
number or location. The latter 
seemed more likely, knowing his 
thoroughness. 

The cube was oddly difficult to 
manage; neither shorts nor singlet 
afforded an adequate pocket. He 
was forced to carry the lead- 
shielded nugget of thorium isotope 
against his leg. It spoiled his gait in 
the centripetal gee field, lending 
him an eccentric lope. 

The elevator at last spun to a stop 
and a zero-gee warning sign blinked 
to remind him to use the freefall 
safety rigging. He hugged the 
thorium close and caught a line, this

time heading “down” into the nadir 
berthing stack. 

He had just cleared the interlock 
chamber when an alarm squalled 
through the stack. An iris opening 
of resilient material squeezed shut 
behind him, then heavy doors rum- 
bled closed. His margin of safety 
had been a matter of only feet. 

Silverthome pressed on, ignoring 
the stevedores and techs who swam 
idly into the main corridor, curious 
about the commotion inboard. He 
caught the eye of a man who wore 
pale green coveralls with the 
“Raumhansa” stitched over his 
heart. “Pardon. Know where I can 
find a tech named Faigele?” 

“Chris Faigele? Sure. Mainte- 
nance depot, beyond bulkhead 
sixty-one.” 

“Vielen dank.” 

“Say, friend,” Raumhansa called 
after him, “what’s going on in- 
board? Why have they sealed up?” 
“Sorry, I’ve no idea.” Silver- 
thome pulled his way along the 
stack. Bulkhead 56, 57 .... He 
ticked off three more and clasped 
the nylon line to slow his plunge. 
God, there couldn’t be much time 
left. But there it was — bulkhead 61! 

He followed a transverse line 
leading into an open hatchway. A 
dozen jumpsuited technicians 
radiated in all attitudes around a 
squawkbox, listening to a blaring 
announcement of some sort. Before 
Silverthome could approach them, 
someone grasped his arm. “This 
way.” 



“Skip the joke,” called the tech 
over his shoulder. “I’ve heard them 
all. I didn’t think you were going to 
make it.” 

“Neither did I.” Silverthome fol- 
lowed the man in a series of caroms 
from handhold to handhold through 
several compartments crowded with 
electronic consoles. They entered a 
small airlock service-chamber con- 
taining racks of tools. A number of 
slack presure suits were stowed 
along the curving bulkhead. 

Faigele battened the hatch. 
“What do you mass?” 

“One seventy-six stripped,” said 
Silverthome. 

“Um, close enough. Henny calcu- 
lated to the ounce. Strip to the skin, 
if you will, and put these on. May I 
have the thorium?” 

Silverthome tore off his clothes, 
donning scratchy woolen under- 
wear, well-worn Lederhosen, a 
linen shirt, knee-length socks and 
hiking boots. The rough tweed jac- 
ket had leather protective patches 
sewn at the elbows. He stuffed the 
Tyrolean felt hat with a feather in 
its brim into the jacket’s pocket. 

Faigele was holding out a bat- 
tered canvas rucksack. “Strap it 
around your middle. The chute’s a 
backpack. Easy now!” The tech 
fastened an aluminum band housing 
the temporal generator under Silver- 
thorne’s arms, then did up the fast- 
disconnect clamps. “Comfortable? 
Now the chute, then we’ll — ” 
Something nudged Walkiire Space 
Station with savage force. A low- 



18 



GALAXY 




frequency conducted rumble rattled 
loose equipment. 

Silverthome cried, “Henderson!” 

Faigele’s nod was solemn. “ Ja , 
there was a report of a man with a 
bomb in the zenith stack. I assumed 
he was Henny. Come! We’ll take 
advantage of the confusion. Radar 
might miss you altogether during 
the hubbub.” 

Silverthome floated behind 
Faigele to a rack of pressure suits, 
allowing the man to help cram 
him — gear, chute, temporal device 
and all — into a strangely bulky 
p-suit. Only a two-inch peephole 
remained in the fishbowl; the re- 
mainder had been opaqued with a 
thickly sprayed white gunk. 

“Hurry!” Faigele motioned for 
him to turn and attached a large 
thruster bottle to the suit’s rear 
mounting pads. “Try your red chin 
lever now.” 

Silverthome glanced in the prism 
viewer above his forehead. The red 
lever was on the left. He craned to 
depress it. 

“ Ganz gut ! You have juice to the 
squib.” Faigele twisted home the 
electrical connector. “Red’s for 
transfer orbit. Yellow’s for retro. 
Henny gave you the drill, didn’t 
he?” 

“Yes.” 

“I’ll seal you then, and you’re on 
your way. Luck!” 

Silverthome bumbled and clanged 
his way into the airlock like an un- 
gainly teddy bear. He fretted, hear- 
ing the conducted hum of pumps 



scavenging air, feeling uncomforta- 
ble swaddled like a baby in the 
heavy outdoor clothing. 

The sound of pumps dwindled, 
died. He waited until the light 
winked green and the outer hatch 
cycled open, felt for the handhold, 
took one agonized breath and pulled 
himself into the endless night. 

Three vessels limned in earthlight 
were berthed in the nadir stick — a 
pair of dartlike shuttles and a 
blunt-ended space-to-space lunar 
transport. He clutched the rung of 
the handhold. There was nothing 
“beneath” him but Earth — 
immense, cloud-draped and lovely. 

Silverthome wrenched himself 
about and grabbed another rung, 
managing to lock both boots against 
the station’s skin. Then, squatting 
he flexed the knee joints to the limit 
of the p-suit’s articulation. Letting 
go, he drove hard with both legs 
and suddenly he was flying through 
vacuum with no sense of motion 
whatsoever. He waited until his 
modest momentum had carried him 
far enough out that he would not be 
a primary radar object in the sta- 
tion’s traffic-control monitors; then 
he threw out an arm and a leg on 
the left side. The resultant gradually 
spun him. He lowered the reticle in 
his headpiece by adroit use of his 
chin and searched for the Pole Star, 
a task make difficult by the tiny 
window in the fishbowl’s thermal 
compound. 

There was Gemini. He corrected 
the residual axial spin, throwing his 



MEMO TO THE LEADER 



19 




head back against the padded rest. 
The Dipper crawled into view. 
When Polaris swam into the reticle, 
he stabilized awkwardly and chin- 
ned the red lever. A mild roar beat 
in his ears. A strong, steady shove 
imparted pressure to the small of his 
back. 

Professor James Silverthome was 
on his way. 

★ * * 

He almost made it across the un- 
paved cowtrail of a road he had 
spotted from on high but the wind 
refused to carry the chute as far as 
he thought it would. Instead of 
landing in the inviting meadow, he 
fell among a clump of shaggy firs 
bordering the forest. 

Instinctively he raised one arm to 
protect his face, sensing fragrant 
boughs whip past. Then, with a 
wrenching jar, he was hanging in 
the late-moming sunshine, listening 
to the wind soughing among the 
branches. 

The ripped chute was neatly im- 
paled on a treetop perhaps twenty 
feet above his head. The ground 
below was obscured by spreading 
limbs but judging from a patch of 
meadow visible across the fenced 
road, he was no more than ten or 
fifteen feet above ground. Not being 
able to see below made things dif- 
ficult; a fence, a hay rick or even a 
farmer’s bull could be under the 
tree. 

“Da ist erl ” cried a childish 
voice. Two boys in their early teens 

20 



ran up the rutted road toward him to 
join a third, younger boy who ex- 
citedly pointed upward. Silverthome 
was filled with wild elation; the boy 
had shouted in German! Switzer- 
land, Austria or possibly even Ger- 
many itself! 

“Are you able to get down, sir?” 
called one of the boys. 

“I think so. What lies underneath 
this limb?” 

“Oh, nothing but grass,” assured 
the youngest. 

“Stand back, then.” Silverthome 
relaxed and undid the parachute’s 
chest catch, raising his arms to slide 
out of the harness. The fir limb 
dropped beneath his weight. He 
pushed it aside as he fell, thrashing 
the air for balance, landing on his 
feet and rolling. “Whew! That last 
step is a crusher!” 

“Are you hurt, mein Herr ?” 

“Not at all.” Silverthome gained 
his feet stiffly, smiling as he 
brushed himself off. “I’m glad you 
three came along when you did.” 
He had no inkling what names 
Omsley had invented for hipi, hav- 
ing had no opportunity to open the 
rucksack and examine his phony 
papers. “I’m Wilhelm Braun. What 
are your names?” 

The boys formally introduced 
themselves as Karl, Stefan and 
Heinz. Karl, the oldest, swept the 
sky with a puzzled squint. “We 
saw no aeroplane, Herr Braun. No 
machine was in sight when you 
drifted down.” 

Silverthome held his smile; the 

GALAXY 




choice of tales was limited. “It was 
a sailplane, Karl. I found myself 
trapped in an updraft and couldn’t 
manage to lose altitude. It was then 
a question of jumping, freezing to 
death or suffocating from lack of air 
to breathe.” 

“Wunderschden!” exclaimed young 
Heinz. 

“Your craft was too high to be 
seen?” asked the persistent Karl. 

“I was very high,” confided Sil- 
verthome, and that was certainly 
true enough. 

“What is that strange thing 
around your waist, Herr Braun?” 

“This? Oh, it’s part of the belt 
that holds one in place while soar- 
ing.” Silverthome fingered the 
temporal generator’s shell, now be- 
reft of both generator and thorium 
isotope. “I jumped too quickly to 
bother disconnecting it.” 

“I shouldn’t wonder that you 
were frightened, Herr Braun. Very 
frightened.” Heinz was round-eyed. 

“I must confess that I was,” said 
Silverthome, thinking that it had 
been more like naked terror than 
simple fear. He stretched, stamping 
the ground to settle the rucksack on 
his shoulders. “I must learn to be 
more careful. Well, my friends, 
which of you knows the way to the 
nearest town?” 

“Winterlingen is down this road 
two kilometers, sir, though I’ve 
never heard it called a ‘town’ be- 
fore.” Karl was grinning. 

“Danke. Say, my parachute 
seems tom beyond repair. You three 



may have it if you can figure out a 
way to get it down.” 

That notion excited the boys. 
They immediately began engineer- 
ing methods of recovering the tom 
chute. 

“ Wiedersehenl ” called Silver- 
thome over his shoulder. He swung 
a leg over the split-rail fence and 
set out along the cowtrail toward 
Winterlingen. It was Germany — no 
borders to cross! He congratulated 
himself, striding along through the 
gloomy fir forest in the best possi- 
ble spirits. He was here, alive and 
well, strolling in the balmy sunshine 
of Adolf Hitler’s Dritte Reich, 
which was still in its infancy if 
Henderson had done his homework 
properly. 

Thoughts of the red-haired martyr 
saddened him. When the boys were 
out of sight, he went behind some 
trees to relieve himself, then eased 
the rucksack from his back. He re- 
moved the aluminum shell of the 
temporal device and hurled it into a 
heavy thicket, pocketed the cur- 
rency, stowing the small handful of 
jewelry in an inside pocket, and 
examined the forged papers. 

Was his German sufficiently 
accent-free that he could pass him- 
self off as an Austrian? Probably. 
Austria was — would be? — an allied 
state if the Anschluss had already 
taken place. Tenses were something 
he would have to watch. Goebbels’ 
pretentious tomes recording World 
War II were no longer a history to 
be taken for granted. 



MEMO TO THE LEADER 



21 




Silverthome thrilled again, men- 
tally pinching himself. He studied 
the Austrian papers; he was now 
Hans Steyr, a free-lance correspon- 
dent from Salzburg. The photo, na- 
turally, was one he’d had taken 
when applying for a Vergangenkarte 
in 2073. The Austrian cover would 
be much simpler than the other. His 
Italian was ragged and he no longer 
felt comfortable speaking it. 

Mind made up, he found matches 
in the tweed jacket and burned the 
unneeded papers, smearing the 
ashes with the hell of his boot. 
Then he resumed his walk, meeting 
only a lone farmer driving a mule- 
drawn cart, nodding pleasantly. In 
twenty minutes he could see a 
church spire poking over the firs. 

Winterlingen turned out to be an 
enchanting village nestled among 
rolling, fir-covered Black Forest 
slopes, containing a tiny bit of 
green in the square called Keinath’s 
Park, a Bierstube, a small inn, a 
cobbler’s shop and several dozen 
neat, half-timbered houses climbing 
the gentle rise behind the church. 

Thirsty from his hike, Silver- 
thome entered the wood-paneled 
taproom. The malty, heavy-bodied 
stein of Dunkelbier served by a 
taciturn barman exceeded his expec- 
tations. Aside from a silent group of 
eldsters clustered around a card 
game at the rearmost table, he and 
the bartender were alone. 

“Ah-h-h! That’s what I needed.” 
Silverthome ordered another. “Do 
you by chance have a map of the 

22 



area, my friend? High time I found 
out just where I’m headed.” 

The barman left off polishing 
glassware. He rummaged under the 
counter, unrolling a dog-eared sheet 
of parchment and slapping it flat on 
top of the bar. “Winterlingen 
is . here.” He made change for 
Silverthome’s Reichsmark without 
further comment. 

Um, he was north and west of 
the Danube. Stuttgart, the closest 
major city, was perhaps fifty 
kilometers to the north while Berlin 
lay over six hundred kilometers 
northeast. He could either work his 
way east to Munich, then head due 
north, or strike for Stuttgart — 
probably the more direct route. 
“Tell me, sir, does the road lead 
from here to Stuttgart?” 

The barman shrugged. “Ja, from 
Hechingen it does. Walk to Tail- 
fingen and take the path over the 
hills to Hechingen. That is the 
simplest.” 

He passed through a slightly 
larger village called Ebingen but did 
not stop. By the time he reached 
Tailfingen, the sun had all but dis- 
appeared behind forested hills and 
ominous saffron clouds were gather- 
ing to produce a ruddy sunset glow 
in the west. 

He found shelter before the rain 
came, allowing a cloddish innkeeper 
to persuade him that the best food 
and softest beds in all Baden- 
Wurttemberg were to be found 
under his roof. The “veal,” flat 
and unseasoned, was served with

tiny dumplings called Spaetzele and 
with a broad wink and a nod. The 
“veal” was obviously venison; 
some unwary stag had wandered too 
near the inn. 

Silverthome washed down his 
meal with two more steins of de- 
licious beer, then sought his room 
at once, gratefully crawling into the 
puffy, down-filled mattress. He 
pulled the comforter around his 
chin, listening in drowsy content- 
ment to rain drip from the eaves. 

He had intended to buy a local 
newspaper but thoughts of trying to 
read it, bone-tired as he was, made 
him abandon the notion. Large 
Gothic numerals on the dining-room 
calendar had been enough to make 
his heart pound in his chest. 



Today was April 12, 1940. If 
anything he had ever been allowed 
to learn of ‘history’ were true, the 
war machine of Nazi Germany had 
just fallen on defenseless Denmark 
and Norway.

Stuttgart, Aalen and northwest 
into Bavaria through Ansbach to 
Nuremberg. 

He slept beneath roadside trees 
after that first, luxurious night and 
either hitched rides or simply 
walked the lightly trafficked country 
roads. A talkative truck driver bent 
his ear for thirty kilimeters, then 
bought him lunch in Bayreuth, in- 
sisting that the “war” which so

frightened everyone would blow 
over in a matter of months. Hadn’t 
there been a “war” since last Sep- 
tember? Ja, and what had mighty 
England and France done after their 
impetuous declarations of war? Ab- 
solutely nothing! They were sitting 
behind the silly Maginot fortifica- 
tions, sweating little green apples 
because the Wehrmacht now oc- 
cupied the Czech, Polish and Scan- 
dinavian strategic points after hav- 
ing had the sand to take back what 
rightfully belonged to Germany in 
the first place — the Sudetenland. 

Silverthome proved such an atten- 
tive listener that the truck driver in- 
vited him to wait while he ran an 
errand — an errand of the flesh as 
reported later in lurid detail — then 
met him faithfully and carried him 
all the way to Leipzig, where Gen- 
eral von Falkenhurst shared the 
front pages with Admiral Raeder 
and the triumph of Weseriibung, the 
High Command’s code name for the 
Norwegian blitz. 

“Your papers, bittel” 

Silverthome stumbled to a halt. 
He had been walking through a 
small town somewhere in Branden- 
burg, ambling along lost in thought. 
He had not seen the policeman until 
the fellow was almost upon him. 
“Natiirlich, mein Herr.” He re- 
membered to smile. 

The Schupo was young, with 
pinched, arrogant features. Silver- 
thome carefully allowed him to 
glimpse his wad of Reichsmarks. 

“And how are things in 



Salzburg, Herr Steyr?” 

“I’ll find out next week. My 
holiday is almost over.” 

“Um.” The policeman handed 
back his papers and strolled away. 
Apparently he had thought Silver- 
thome a vagrant. The incident, his 
first bad moment, made him realize 
that Lederhosen and a rucksack — 
while appropriate for the wilds of 
southern Germany — would certainly 
never do in Berlin. 

He stopped in Wittenberg to sort 
through heaps of discards in a 
second-hand clothing store, emerg- 
ing in a worn but not-yet-threadbare 
gray pin-striped suit and rundown- 
at-the-heels black shoes. 

On April 19th, filled with nostal- 
gia, Silverthome stood once again 
beneath Brandenburger Tor, gazing 
wistfully down Unter den Linden. 
In the mid- 18th century, Frederick 
the Great’s heyday, Berlin’s main 
street had been lined six rows deep 
in magnificent old lindens. Now 
there were but four rows of puny, 
two- or three-year-old trees, plant- 
ed, he later learned, during con- 
struction of a subway running be- 
neath the thoroughfare. 

Overwhelmed by the city, he 
skipped lunch and went wandering, 
finding the streets still village-like, 
still devoted more to the use of 
bicycles than automobiles. A few 
Pferde Droschken lingered here and 
there — holdovers from another era. 
Far fewer uniforms were to be seen 
than he would have anticipated con- 
sidering the wartime status of the 



24 



GALAXY 




capital. White-jacketed traffic 
policemen controlled vehicular flow 
with Prussian dignity, while now 
and then the red collar tabs and 
feldgrau of a Wehrmacht officer 
caught his eye. He stopped in 
Friederichstrasse to watch a dozen 
Hitler Youth troop past. The boys 
wore short black trousers, brown 
shirts and black neckerchiefs slipped 
through braided leather holders. 

He sat on a bench for an hour, 
resting, and decided to accept 
Omsley’s advice about atemporizing 
thoroughly. Feeling “at home” in a 
foreign era was vital; remaining a 
stranger would only heighten his 
chance of making some irreversible 
error. 

Then, too impatient to worry fur- 
ther about atemporizing, he hurried 
off in another fit of sightseeing, 
strolling down the center mall of 
U nter den Linden to find that Fred- 
erick’s old armory, the Zeughaus, 
had been transformed into a military 
hall of fame. Intrigued, he in- 
spected suits of 16th-century ar- 
mor, the death mask of von Hin- 
denberg, hundreds of military uni- 
forms, the hat Napoleon had wom 
on the Waterloo battlefield. 

All Berlin had changed. Fred- 
erick’s parade ground was now oc- 
cupied by the busy acreage of Tem- 
pelhof Aerodrome; the red brick 
mass of Town Hall had been scrub- 
bed of accumulated grime; many 
open fields and woodlands he viv- 
idly remembered from Frederick’s 
time — mostly in western sectors of 



the city — were now a maze of con- 
crete streets and buildings. 

Ravenous, he treated himself to 
dinner that evening in a popular res- 
taurant featuring twelve halls, each 
with its own distinctive theme and 
decor; Sunny Spain, the American 
Wild West, the Rhineland and so 
on. He chose the Bavarian Alps, 
watching a thunderstorm rake 
Zugspitze, Germany’s highest peak, 
while his Rouladen lay neglected on 
the plate. It was quite realistic; 
thunder crashed and simulated rain 
drummed on the roof. Then the sun 
broke through and a yodeler strolled 
about, comforting the survivors. 

At dusk he managed to rent a 
cheerless attic room from a grumpy 
widow who lived across the Ober- 
baum Bridge. The room was claus- 
trophobic, smelled of mildew and 
was bleakly furnished, but all he 
wanted was a place to sleep. Trans- 
portation in Berlin, 1940, would 
have done credit to many cities in 
later eras. A single ticket entitled 
the holder to transfer at will from 
subway to surface to elevated in 
whatever combination he chose. 
And after his first visit to one, Sil- 
verthome decided to use Berlin’s 
postal substations as his “office” 
since even their branches offered 
well-lighted public writing rooms 
with inkpots, blotters and — wonder 
of wonders! — pens that wrote. 

The next day, April 20th, he 
joined thousand of Berliners con- 
gregated along Charlottenburger 
Chaussee in the wooded Tiergarten

to watch Adolf Hitler’s birthday 
parade. The crowd was congenial, 
enjoying an excited holiday mood. 
Many individuals had equipped 
themselves with crude periscopes 
fashioned from two hand mirrors af- 
fixed to a cardboard mailing tube. 
People stood patiently as the pro- 
cession of antiquated horse-drawn 
caissons rumbled past. A few ar- 
mored cars were interspersed be- 
tween marching, field-equipped re- 
giments, most Panzers and other 
modem weapons being engaged in 
far more important business else- 
where. 

Finally, behind an enormous mili- 
tary band trumpeting the anthem, 
wheeled a huge Mercedes tourer 
bearing the 20th century’s most re- 
viled despot. Surrounded by black- 
clad SS elite, Goebbels sat beside 
him, smiling ferret-like, sharing The 
Leader’s glory. 

An electric fluid filled the air as 
Hitler’s entourage swept by. Silver- 
thome couldn’t tear his eyes away; 
the scene was straight from one of 
the stark black-and-white films he 
had been forced to view ad 
nauseum in school, and it provoked 
the same reaction within him — 
revulsion combined with a twinge 
of disbelief. It was incredible that 
the smug, stereotyped face beneath 
the billed cap, riding past Silver- 
thorne’s vantage point, appearing no 
larger than one’s little fingernail, 
had been able to place its mark so 
indelibly upon mankind. 

Eyes watering, emotions churn- 



ing, Silverthome turned away. He 
edged toward the fringes of the 
crowd, struck by the hopelessness 
of his situation. The elation he had 
experienced upon arriving in Berlin 
was gone. What could one lonely 
man do to thwart the purpose and 
might surrounding him in Ger- 
many’s young Reich ? Omsley’s 
words rang in his mind: Lustmann' s 
venture was successful. It it can be 
done once, it can be done again. 

No reason why it can’t, Bernard. 
No reason, except .... 

Silverthome reprimanded himself 
for defeatism. He had arrived in Ber- 
lin less than two days ago, not 
long enough to even begin atem- 
porizing. Barring a major miracle, it 
would take much, much longer to 
get a whiff of Lustmann’s trail. It 
was one helluva conceit to expect 
miracles — major, minor or inciden- 
tal. 

How could he hope to locate 
Franz Lustmann in a thriving me- 
tropolis of four million? He prowled 
among the trees, overcome by a 
dark mood, until a sudden thought 
occurred to him: If he himself had 
wanted a glimpse of Hitler today, 
might not Lustmann also be some- 
where here in Tiergarten? 

Silverthome quickened his pace. 
The crowd was dispersing, gabbling 
about how triumphant Der Fuhrer 
had looked, how gracious he had 
been in accepting a nosegay from 
tiny blonde twin girls before the 
parade, how the war would soon be 
over and things would return to

GALAXY 




normal. He searched their faces, 
ploughing back and forth along the 
thoroughfare, once hurrying after a 
tall man who might have been 
Lustmann, catching up with him to 
discover a puffing, red-faced eldster 
who probably walked his four 
kilometers religiously each day to 
keep fit. 

When the crowd thinned, he 
turned discouraged steps toward the 
Kroll, a fashionable outdoor restau- 
rant in Tiergarten now doing a 
land-office business in the parade’s 
wake. He circulated around the 
edges of the terrace for fifteen min- 
utes. Franz Lustmann was not there. 

Crestfallen, Silverthome walked 
about for the remainder of the af- 
ternoon, inspecting the elephants at 
the zoo, lunching at a sidewalk 
cafe, getting drenched by an unex- 
pected shower. He ended his tour 
on the Oberbaum Bridge, staring 
down into the Spree’s turgid waters 
until twilight’s chill forced him to 
climb the creaking stair to his cheer- 
less room. 

With sudden resolve he switched 
on the naked bulb, found a pencil 
and a scrap of wrapping paper and 
began listing everything he had ever 
learned about this quarry. 

* * * 

The hero had been young for his 
mission when Erich Lebe’s fanatic 
team dispatched him in 1974 — only 
twenty-eight or thereabouts — which 
meant that Silverthome would be 



searching for someone ten real-time 
years his junior. Bombastic prop- 
aganda eulogies had characterized 
Lustmann as a physicist, a dedi- 
cated scientist who had aided and 
abetted the perfecting of Lebe’s 
original temporal-transition device. 
Silverthome suspected that Lust- 
mann was actually more con man 
than “physicist.” The sleek, egotis- 
tical gloss of the Reichsheld , pic- 
tured in every sort of tribute imag- 
ginable, bespoke high intelligence, 
high resolution and an even higher 
degree of self-satisfaction. 

Rumor had it that Lustmann also 
dabbled in the occult sciences. His 
official career, after a celebrated re- 
turn to a world Germany ruled with 
dazzling thoroughness, had been a 
checkered affair: four marriages, an 
international scandal involving a 
ballerina in Kharkov Gauleitung 
(officialese had never been able to 
completely squelch that one) and a 
dozen dismal dips and rocketing as- 
cents in and out of Party favor, 
largely because of his lifelong indif- 
ference to politics as such. Franz 
Lustmann had considered himself 
above mundane matters because of 
his single heroic escapade. 

And his lifestyle had proved his 
undoing. The underground move- 
ment to which Silverthome be- 
longed had learned that Lustmann’s 
widely mourned death in 2004 had 
not really been caused by a stroke. 
The hero had drunk himself to 
death, all the while conducting 
seances for affluent dowagers 



MEMO TO THE LEADER

reading horoscopes and wenching 
limitlessly — a demise quite unlike 
that of any other “physicist.” 

Which led Silverthome back to 
the ever-present enigma: How had 
Lustmann, alone and friendless, 
managed to contact the Nazi hierar- 
chy and make his prescient knowl- 
edge feh? How had he changed 
history — the actual mechanics of it? 
Silverthome had heard this question 
debated endlessly; everyone had his 
pet theory. There was, for instance, 
the Martin Borman hypothesis that 
the mysterious, little-known Bor- 
man, who had taken Hess’s place as 
number-two man in Hitler’s inner 
circle, was actually Franz Lust- 
mann. The other theories he had 
heard struck Silverthome as equally 
absurd. 

He undressed quickly in the chil- 
led room and leaped into bed, star- 
ing for a long time at the dim ceil- 
ing. It did not matter, really, what 
method Lustmann had used. Finding 
the man would solve it all. Find- 
ing . Lustmann .... 

Awaking refreshed and filled with 
new energy, he stopped at a book- 
seller’s shop in Alexander Platz and 
bought a guidebook entitled BER- 
LIN VON A BIS Z. Each night 
thereafter, on a sheet of wrapping 
paper he plotted every major and 
minor bistro, opera house, theatre, 
bordello and movie house he could 
discover either by reference to the 
guidebook or through scouring Ber- 
lin neighborhood by neighborhood. 
Making his rounds, searching for 



that unmistakable face in the crowds 
and reading about the “war” in the 
newspapers occupied his days. He 
lived Spartanly, knowing that his 
current rate of expenditure would 
exhaust the cash in about one 
month. The jewelry was a last re- 
sort. 

Omsley would have been proud 
of the way he was atemporizing. He 
found himself using the rich, racy 
argot of Berlin’s streets with natural 
ease. Money was “wire,” “moss,” 
“gravel” or “powder.” Reichs- 
marks were called “ Eier ” — eggs 
— or “ Emmchen , a diminutive of 
the letter “M.” The best tutors by 
far were the salty-tongued flower 
women of Leipziger Strasser. Sil- 
verthome handled the blooms dis- 
approvingly, commenting on their 
withered appearance despite their 
excessive cost. The fluent dress- 
ing-down he received taught him 
a great deal about the niceties of 
slanderous abuse. 

He spent many evenings at Staats 
Oper, arriving a full hour before the 
performance to watch for Lustmann 
among early comers, buying a 
standing-room ticket, spending the 
intermissions prowling about the 
lobby, then watching again as the 
opera house emptied. He enjoyed 
Freischutz, reveled in the contra- 
puntal magnificence of Meister- 
singer, almost developed fallen 
arches during the interminable vocal 
dialogue of Parsifal and endured a 
rather indifferent production of 
Zauberflaute, concluding that

Lustmann was not attending the op- 
era. 

He next tried sporting events, 
concerts and even one Nazi rally, 
with equally disappointing results. 
The dread notion that Lustmann had 
not yet arrived in Berlin cropped up 
increasingly, bringing on periods of 
gloomy depression. He resolutely 
pushed the thought away. Nothing 
in the present course of events 
seemed any whit different from the 
official history of World War II he 
had studied in school. 

Silverthome played endless sup- 
positional games. He put himself in 
Lustmann’s place, imagining where 
he would stay, what he might do to 
occupy his time. Why, there was no 
real difference between Lustmann 
and himself. Both were interlopers, 
strangers in a strange land. But the 
man had to be here. Lebe would 
certainly have wanted his man on 
the scene when hostilities erupted. 
It would be best, perhaps, if he just 
took Lustmann’s presence for 
granted; that would make finding 
him a simple matter of persever- 
ance, of never giving up. 

At the end of the first week in 
May a despondent James Silver- 
thorne was consulting his guidebook 
in a postal sub- station writing room 
near the Berlin Zoo. He glanced up 
as a tall man entered, then looked 
away quickly, forgetting to breathe. 

When he dared look again, the 
man had seated himself in a cane- 
backed chair. Hand propped to 
forehead, he was busily addressing 



an envelope. 

Was it Lustmann? Silverthome 
was not certain. He rose silently, 
passing behind the tall man on his 
way to the door. A hasty glance 
gave him the impression of florid 
German cursive written in green 
ink. He fled the postal sub-station, 
having no intention of allowing his 
suspected quarry a look at his face. 

Silverthome hurried to the end of 
the block, crossed with the light and 
came back abreast of the postal sta- 
tion’s entrance. He folded his arms 
across his chest to calm the trem- 
bling. 

The instant the angular, rather 
spare figure wearing a well-tailored 
camels-hair topcoat appeared in the 
doorway, all of Silverthorne’s doubt 
vanished. The aquiline nose, rather 
prognathous jaw and dirty-blond 
hair firmed his conviction. 

Heart pounding, he began to trail 
Lustmann, stopping once while the 
man paused to light a cigarette and 
survey the few pedestrians walking 
behind him. A very cautious man, 
Lustmann, Silverthome could not 
imagine why he was concerned 
about being followed. 

Lustmann led him several blocks 
on foot before opening a bright red 
letterbox — one of five thousand or 
so in Berlin proper — and posting an 
envelope. Noting the cross streets, 
Silverthome continued his discreet 
shadowing. 

They turned into Urtter den Lin- 
den. Surprisingly Lustmann crossed 
the boulevard and mounted the steps

of the swank Hotel Adlon. Why 
not? A gentleman of Lustmann’s 
sensibilities could not be expected 
to stay just anywhere. 

Picking his way across the 
swastika-bannered thoroughfare, 
Silverthorne paused behind a parked 
car. Yes, there was cautious, care- 
ful Franz Lustmann peering from a 
lobby window. 

When the tall man finally quit the 
window, Silverthorne ran up the 
steps and pushed his way through 
the glass door, sitting down on a 
leather settee behind a marble pillar 
and feeling rather out of place in 
the sumptuous lobby. Lustmann was 
at the desk. A clerk reached up and 
took a key from the pegboard, pass- 
ing it over to him with a smile. 

Silverthorne waited until the lift 
doors closed behind Lustmann, then 
sauntered past the desk. The clerk 
was now sorting mail and since it 
was shortly after the luncheon hour, 
most guests would surely be out. 
Only three empty pegs remained in 
the uppermost row; two on the left 
but only one on the right where the 
clerk had taken down Lustmann’s 
key. 

Silverthorne left the Hotel Adlon 
walking on air. Franz Lustmann 
was a guest in room 612. The long 
odds against Silverthorne ’s chances 
for success were- diminishing 
rapidly. He retraced his steps to- 
ward the mailbox where his quarry 
had posted the letter. Mail pick-ups 
were made four times daily during 
the week. Silverthorne walked fast. 



When he rounded the comer, he 
saw that a postman was reaching 
out to unlock the letterbox. The 
man looked startled to see someone 
dash up to him, heavily out of 
breath. 

“Pardon me . sir. Just this 
moment I posted a letter and 
I . think it was incorrectly ad- 
dressed. Would it be too much to 
ask . may I check the address?” 
The postman squinted suspici- 
ously. “That’s most irregular, sir. 
I’d lose my job if I allowed anyone 
to tamper with — ” 

“No, no!” Silverthorne said 
quickly. “I won’t even touch the 
letter. I only want to make certain 
the street number is correct. It’s 
written in . green ink. You can’t 
miss it.” Silverthorne folded a 
Reichsmark note in the palm of his 
hand. 

The postman blinked, then made 
it disappear. “I suppose we can do 
that much for a regular customer,” 
he said pleasantly. “Green ink 
.... Oh! Can this be it, mein 
Herr?" 

Silverthorne locked the address in 
his mind. “My friend,” he said in 
a disguested tone, “I’ve bothered 
you for nothing. The address is 
exactly as it should be.” 

The postman shrugged. “Then 
everyone’s happy, no?” 

“Everyone. Be sure to have a 
few beers on your way home from 
work and forget your troubles. Vie- 
len dank]” 

“Any time.”

He headed for the nearest bus 
stop. The letter had been addressed 
to one Zoltan — no last name — at a 
street number somewhere in the 
Wilmersdorf district. It probably 
meant nothing but he intended to 
check it out nevertheless. 

★ ★ ★ 

Silverthorne got off the buss and 
walked five blocks through an un- 
fashionable section of Wilversdorf. 
The buildings and streets looked in- 
definably seedy, as though fre- 
quented by less-than-affluent citi- 
zens. He passed a delicatessen 
whose boarded shop windows par- 
tially concealed shattered glass. A 
crude Star of David daubed on the 
padlocked door told a mute story. 

He spotted Zoltan ’s sign upon 
turning the corner at the end of the 
block, chuckling in self-deprecation. 
The Great Zoltan, it seemed, was a 
“world-famous” astrologer. 

His establishment’s sign was fes- 
tooned with zodiacal arcana and 
capped with a mystical Persian Eye. 
Lustmann’s letter had sent him 
chasing rainbows. The “physicist” 
was undoubtedly even here follow- 
ing his preoccupation with the oc- 
cult, amusing himself with horo- 
scopes and such nonsense. Good! It 
meant he would have less time to 
devote to his mission. 

He continued past Zoltan’s place 
out of curiosity. The window was 
opaqued. A poster featuring a 
bearded, turbaned man who glared 



at the world with hostile intensity 
was bounded by a catch-phrase al- 
most lost in a forest of exclamation 
points: “!!!!! the ancient art 

CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE !!!!!” 

Bemused and disappointed, he 
caught a bus back to Unter den 
Linden where he stood across from 
the Hotel Adlon for several hours, 
reading Volkischer Beobachter 
while covertly scanning the hotel’s 
steps. At eight-thirty he gave up 
and went to his lonely room to 
think. It had been a productive day; 
he was happily weary. 

But something nibbled at his sub- 
conscious all evening, something 
just beyond range of his mind’s 
peripheral vision. Whatever it was, 
he could not seem to focus on it or 
bring it to the surface. He went to 
bed early to escape the chill and lay 
staring into the darkness, revolving 
strategies, examining theories, sus- 
pecting this, discarding that. 

Sometime in the wee hours he 
awoke with a start, crying, “. or 
History!” Leaving the bed in a sin- 
gle bound, Silverthorne began to 
pace the frigid room, smashing fist 
into open palm, uttering short, be- 
nedictive profanities in four lan- 
guages. 

It fit! By God, it fit! “The An- 
cient Art can Change your Life,” 
he muttered. Could Lustmann have 
actually . ? 

No, no. It was all too damned far- 
fetched. Or was it? For some rea- 
son, he knew he had found the an- 
swer, unbelievable though it might

be: Lustmann was actually playing 
the role of seer in carrying out 
Erich Lebe’s fantastic scheme to 
alter the course of history! 

Unable to sleep, Silverthome 
watched the dawn that morning — a 
gloomy gray light seeping through 
heavy clouds — before once again 
taking up his post outside the Hotel 
Adlon. 

Twice he shifted to the center 
mall of Unter den Linden and then 
to spots farther down the avenue. It 
would never do for the suspicious 
Lustmann to tag him as a loiterer. 
At one o’clock, having learned 
every word of the May 8th 
Beobachter by rote, he gave up and 
had a skimpy lunch. His money was 
draining away at an alarming rate; 
he would have to pinch every Pfen- 
nig from now on. 

The morning’s unproductive vigil 
left him with a sour taste in his 
mouth. He had hoped to tail 
Lustmann and find a connecting 
link between reality and the out- 
rageous “false prophet” conjecture 
that yesterday’s letter had gener- 
ated. 

But the “physicist” seemed to be 
sticking close to his room. Silver- 
thome decided, after arguing the 
matter with himself, to reconnoiter 
the Great Zoltan’s astrology 
parlor — and to be damned careful 
how he went about it. 

He strolled about for an hour, 
then returned to his room and 
spruced himself up, combing his 
hair, which badly needed trimming, 

32 



and rubbing the worst scuff marks 
from the second-hand shoes. 

He got off the bus in Wilversdorf 
and found a pawnshop, where he 
haggled over a pair of diamond ear- 
rings from the handful of jewelry he 
had carried into the past, amazed to 
receive one-third more than his es- 
timate of their worth. 

Feeling better with money in his 
pocket once again, he walked the 
four blocks to Zoltan’s place, find- 
ing a glistening black Mercedes 
sedan drawn up at the curb. The 
auto was conspicuous, utterly out of 
place on the sleazy street. He 
walked past it to the comer and 
then turned. The Mercedes had a 
polished, military aspect about it, 
although the license tab was civi- 
lian. 

He returned speculatively and 
paused. Zoltan’s door had no bell. 
He inched it open — it moved easily, 
silently — until he could slip through 
into a reception room hung with 
musty-smelling red draperies. A 
crystal ball, like a giant’s teardrop, 
lay on a badly marred walnut desk. 
A fearsome poster of the Great Zol- 
tan plying his art leered insolently 
from the wall. 

Silverthome closed the door with 
painstaking care. Low voices were 
filtering toward him from beyond 
the draped doorway that led to the 
rear of the shop. He stood dead- 
still, listening. 

“ — and you yourself did not read 
the letter, I suppose?” The testy 
voice was laden with sarcasm.

“I . no, no! It came in yester- 
day’s four o’clock post, mein Herr. 

1 called your office immediately, 
just as I have always done.” Silver- 
thome made note of the accent — 
Hungarian, or possibly Romanian. 

“Patience, Kurt,” advised a 
more cultured voice. “ Herr Zoltan 
has been most cooperative. I’m cer- 
tain he will continue to be. Won’t 
you, Herr Zoltan?” 

“Oh, but naturally, sir.” 

“There, you see, Kurt? The rea- 
son I’ve come personally to talk 
with you today, Herr Zoltan, is that 
this madness has gotten completely 
out of hand. When whoever signs 
himself ‘A Friend of the Reich’ first 
began his astounding predictions, 
everyone considered him a mere 
crank, nothing more. 

“But when he precisely defined 
the terms of the Munich Pact — even 
before Prime Minister Chamberlain 
llew to Berchtesgaden — foretold our 
co-existence treaty with the USSR 
and the spineless antics of the 
British and French when we liber- 
ated the Sudetenland, annexed Aus- 
tria, and liberated Czechoslovakia, 
the Flihrer himself became a de- 
voted admirer. In fact, I once 
chanced to be in his presence when 
he remarked that ‘great minds think 
alike.' Amusing, Herr Zoltan? Or 
don’t you think so?” 

“Star-gazing nonsense!” said the 
one called Kurt. 

After a short, weighty silence, 
the smooth voice continued. “That 
may or may not be the case; we

shall see. An any rate, Herr Zoltan, 
this ‘Friend of the Reich' is begin- 
ning to have an unsettling effect 
upon the very foreign policy of our 
state. Indeed, Nostradamus pales 
beside such monumental prophecies. 
Our ‘friend’ predicted the lull be- 
ginning last fall, explaining that the 
Franco-British alliance would ‘pro- 
ject various offensive schemes it 
lacked the muscle to execute.’ He 
accurately named names and 
Wehrmacht deployments to the re- 
gimental level — their then-current 
positions. 

“He told us, and I quote: ‘Ger- 
many will not attack Belgium in 
November, nineteen thirty-nine, as 
planned, greatly disappointing The 
Leader, but will wait propitiously 
until spring, nineteen forty, then 
strike where a strike is least ex- 
pected.’ Last month, Herr Zoltan, 
Norway fell.” 

‘ 'Ausserordentlich ! ’ ’ 

“Actually that is something of an 
understatement. It is uncanny, cros- 
sing all boundaries of mere fortune- 
telling. The man has been one 
thousand per cent correct in his 
predictions.” 

The sound of labored breathing 
emanated from beyond the curtained 
doorway. James Silverthome lis- 
tened, entranced. 

“No, do not be afraid,” the sil- 
ken voice went on. “I plan to make 
you privy to the contents of yester- 
day’s letter in the interest of learn- 
ing more about this ‘great art’ of 
yours, Herr Zoltan. But do not let 



your tongue become careless. 
Should you disclose a single sylla- 
ble of what I am about to tell you, 
we will have your skin taken off 
one square centimeter at a time. 
Understood?” 

An appealing, blubbering sound 
formed Zoltan ’s assurance. 

“Excellent, Herr Zoltan! That’s 
settled. Now I shall skip the usual 
gibberish, if gibberish it be, con- 
cerning Saturn being in the Sun’s 
second house and so forth. You 
may pretend to understand all of 
that nattering if you wish. I do not. 

“Let’s see ... ah, here we are: 
‘In the early hours of May tenth, 
Army Group ‘B,’ namely von 
Kiichler’s Eighteenth Army, striking 
quickly across the Peel Line, will 
push Winkelman’s Army of the 
Netherlands back to the Dyle Line, 
while von Reichenau’s Sixth Army 
advances across the Belgian frontier 
with huge success. Von Leeb’s 
Army Group ‘C’ will feint an attack 
on the Maginot defenses, pinning 
down over forty French divisions, 
which will allow von Rundstedt’s 
Army Group ‘A,’ led by General 
Guderian’s seven armored division, 
to crash through the forest of the 
Ardennes.’ 

“There! I’m unable to enlighten 
you as to the accuracy or inaccuracy 
of all this, Herr Zoltan, both be- 
cause of national security and be- 
cause of the fact that it hasn’t yet 
happened. May tenth is but day 
after tomorrow and we shall see 
what we shall see. But I simply

must tell you — please remember 
your skin — that General von Man- 
stein, Rundstedt’s chief of staff, has 
made a constant nuisance of himself 
advocating a totally unorthodox 
strike through the hilly, wooded 
Ardennes Forest ever since last fall. 

“Hear me, Zoltan! This is abso- 
lute magic! No one who failed to at- 
tend OKW staff conferences could 
possibly have learned about Man- 
stein’s tactical master-stroke. Not 
possibly! 

“Now then,” continued the 
smooth voice, growing a shade 
more insistent, “what we must 
learn is this: Is it at all 

conceivable — not probable, mine 
you, merely conceivable — that the, 
er, ‘science’ of astrology would 
permit such refined, definitive and 
uncannily accurate predictions?” 

After a wheezing sigh that bub- 
bled with terror, Zoltan said, 
“This . man, whoever he is, 
lays claim to possession of certain 
ancient Greek manuscripts that per- 
mit a purer, less corrupted method 
of allowing the stars to reveal them- 
selves to — ” 

“No, no, Zoltan. I asked for no 
lecture on arcana. Give me a simple 
‘yes, or a simple ‘no.’ Can it be 
done?” 

“I ... do not believe so, sir. I 
cannot imagine how such . detail 
or accuracy could possibly be ob- 
tained. ” 

“Nor I, Zoltan,” said the other. 
“Nor I. We must run this charlatan 
to the ground, mustn’t we? It’s 



dangerous and disturbing to have a 
mind-reader like this ‘Friend of the 
Reich ’ about, especially when the 
Fiihrer finds himself more and more 
inclined to await the arrival of his 
next letter before making a decision 
vital to us all. Herr Himmler and I 
have become quite con- 
cerned . .” 

Standing perfectly still for so 
long, Silverthorne’s leg had 
cramped. He shifted his weight to 
massage it and a board creaked 
noisily in the floor. He whirled, 
dry-mouthed, and grasped the knob, 
pulling open the door and slamming 
it. “ Guten Tagl" he called hope- 
fully. 

Concerted whispering went on 
behind the draperies. An ashen- 
faced, perspiring man who looked 
ten years older than the Zoltan in 
the posters emerged hesitantly. 
“Yes?” 

“ ‘S tut sehr gleich, Herff Zol- 
tan. Wonder if I might arrange for a 
personal reading this afternoon? 
You see, I’m a Sagittarius. I’m 
faced with a vital business dealing 
and—” 

“I’m sorry, sir. Another time 
perhaps.” Zoltan wiped his 
forehead with his sleeve. “I’m 
not . feeling myself today.” 

“Oh?” Silverthome frowned. 
“I’m distressed to hear it, of 
course. Might I try tomorrow, sir? 
It’s very important to me.” 

“Tomorrow will be fine. Come 
at two. Please excuse me now.” 

“I’ll be prompt,” said Silver-

thome, closing the door behind 
him. He walked toward the bus 
stop, feeling twelve feet tall. He 
had managed to learn the “what” 
of it. All that remained was devis- 
ing a feasible “how.” 

* + ★ 

Lustmann did not leave his 
sanctuary all next day. Silverthorne 
began to feel like one of Unter den 
Linden’s landmarks. 

He prowled about the streets near 
the Hotel Adlon in a nervouse 
frame of mind. Tomorrow was May 
10th. Should the prediction he had 
overhead prove valid — and he had 
every reason to know it would — the 
German offensive in Europe would 
begin. 

It was frustrating to realize what 
had to be done at the same time 
Lustmann was holed up like a fox 
in his lair. He had planned to wait 
until the man left his room, then 
have a go at breaking in and .... 

And what? He drifted to his 
favorite think-spot on the Oberbaum 
Bridge, acknowledging with dismay 
that he had never carried his inten- 
tions beyond the point of breaking 
into Lustmann’s room. He revolved 
tentative notions until well after 
sunset. There seemed to be no prac- 
tical way to intercept Lustmann’s 
apocryphal letters and make changes 
in them — an action that appealed to 
him as the nicest, most subtle 
method of achieving his purpose. 
The Nazi leadership had no idea of 



who Lustmann was — no idea he 
even existed — nor the slightest inkl- 
ing of his motives. Nor would 
they — ever. Silverthorne spent a 
moment or two admiring 
Lustmann’s unorthodox means of 
gaining Hitler’s ear, coinciding as it 
did with the Fuhrer’s well- 
advertised mystic concept of “Nor- 
dic destiny.” 

With a resigned grimace he spat 
into the Spree, having at last faced 
the issue squarely. The only answer 
was the obvious one: He would 
have to take Franz Lustmann’s 
place. 

The remaining question was 
whether James Silverthorne, 
erstwhile professor of history, who 
had never killed anything higher in 
the chain of life than the elk he had 
bagged with his longbow in the 
summer of 207 1 , could muster the 
courage and resourcefulness to do 
what must now be done. 

Only a few Reichsmarks re- 
mained in his wallet. Despite that, 
he purchased a small bottle of 
Schnapps and took it back to his 
dreary room, deciding to wait until 
the dinner hour when the hotel 
lobby would be comfortably 
crowded. Not too much Schnapps, 
he warned himself. He wanted only 
enough to make him relaxed and 
glib-tongued. This would be the 
toughest night of his life. Perhaps 
the last. 

A little after eight o’clock he 
phoned the hotel desk from a con- 
venience booth around the comer, 



36 



GALAXY 




asking for room 612. The phone 
jangled twice before someone said, 
"Hello?” 

Silverthome almost panicked and 
hung up; the voice at the other end 
was feminine. “ Guten Abend,” he 
said cautiously. ‘‘May I speak to 
Ihe gentleman there in 612?” 

"Sure,” said the girl, “I’ll call 
him, though he’s no gentlemen, be- 
lieve me.” 

Silverthome could hear muffled 
voices. At last a petulant male voice 
said, "Yes?” 

“ Herr Lustmann?” 

There was the faintest intake of 
breath. “I . think you must have 
(lie wrong number.” 

“I beg you, don’t hang up, Herr 
Lustmann. I must see you im- 
mediately. You are in grave 
danger. ” 

“Danger? What nonsense!” 

“You must believe me, sir.” 

After a short pause, Lustmann 
said, “You are either a practical 
jokester or a madman. Bother me 
again and I shall call the police. 
You may be assured of it.” 

“Please listen,” Silverthome 
pleaded earnestly. “I’m not an in- 
former. I’ll be only to happy to ex- 
plain when we’re face to face. Have 
Ihe lady go, if you will. I’ll be at 
your door in precisely ten min- 
utes.” 

“Who are you?” 

Silverthome moistened his lips. 
"I was bom February ninth, two 
thousant thirty-seven,” he said. “I 
can’t say more over the phone, sir. 



I’ll come in ten minutes. It will be 
greatly to your advantage to keep 
the appointment.” 

He cradled the phone and walked 
twice around the block to quiet his 
jumpiness and to allow Lustmann 
an opportunity to rid himself of the 
girl. So that was why the “physi- 
cist” never went out. Between his 
prophecies, stars and chippies, he 
had little reason to leave the Hotel 
Adlon. 

Silverthome entered the hotel be- 
hind a chattering group of Bummel- 
ners headed for the bar. He drifted 
inconspicuously through the maze 
of pillars, leather settees and potted 
palms to the stairwell, meeting no 
one as he trudged upward to the 
sixth floor. 

The door to 612 was ajar. He 
knocked softly and the door swung 
wide to reveal a tastefully furnished 
parlor. No one was in sight but in- 
stinct told him that Lustmann was 
standing behind the door. 

Placing both hands in front of 
him, Silverthome stepped across the 
threshold. Franz Lustmann kneed 
the door shut and locked it without 
taking his eyes from Silverthome. A 
Walther automatic pistol was in his 
fist. “Well, Herr Twenty Thirty- 
seven, this had better be damned 
good!” 

Staring into Lustmann’s patrician 
features as though fascinated, Sil- 
verthome said, “I . can’t tell 
you what an honor this is for me, 
sir. I sincerely wish there were time 
for us — ”

“Out with it! Who the devil are 
you? What do you want?” 

Silverthome clicked his heels, 
tipping his head. “Allow me to in- 
troduce myself, sir. Steyr, a minor 
cog in the Temporal Security 
Agency of Deutsches Weltanreich." 

“ Weltan . A look of 
amazement crept over Lustmann’s 
florid features. The Walther auto- 
matic sagged in his grip. 
“Then ... I will succeed ?” 

“Most gloriously, sir. You will 
not only succeed in your holy mis- 
sion but when you return to nine- 
teen seventy-four in triumph, you 
will find yourself second only to the 
Fiihrer’s memory, and to Erich 
Lebe himself, in the world’s es- 
teem. Our world’s esteem.” 

“But, Steyr, this is marvelous!” 
“You must hurry now,” warned 
Silverthome. “Your letter to Zoltan 
day before yesterday has Himmler’s 
people running in circles. They’ve 
managed to trace you to the postal 
station where you addressed the 
letter — the station near the zoo. They 
could be here at any instant.” 
Lustmann’s eyes widened. The 
last vestiges of suspicion vanished 
and he slipped the Walther into a 
shoulder hoster, taking Silver- 
thorne’s arm with unwonted fam- 
iliarity. “Yes, yes. I’ll pack at 
once, Styr. Will you take me to a 
safer place?” 

Silverthome moved his head 
solemnly from side to side. “Unfor- 
tunately, that is impossible for I 
cannot leave. When they come, a 



scapegoat must be present. I’ve 
been . well trained.” 

Lustmann stared at him, open- 
mouthed. “By God, I daresay you 
have, Steyr! Help me with the 
suitcases there in the bedroom.” 
“Jawohl, Herr Lustmann.” He 
followed the other, eyes darting 
from one item of furnishing to 
another. There was a heavy ceramic 
lamp on the endtable beside the 
divan that might do, or even the 
small chiming clock on the mantel- 
piece. Either would make a satisfac- 
tory, though cumbersome, cudgel. 
He would search for something 
easier to handle. 

“What sort of tale will you tell 
them?” asked Lustmann, flinging 
open a suitcase on the bed. 

“I’ve been drilled in the astrolog- 
ical sciences, sir. I must appear to 
be a crank, a false lead. Your next 
prediction will convince them 
they’ve apprehended the wrong 
man.” 

“I . see. But you realize what 
will happen ...” 

“Do not concern yourself with 
me, sir. I wear a false tooth that 
can be used if it becomes necessary. 
The Temporal Security Agency is 
most thorough.” 

Lustmann grunted. “Thorough 
isn’t the word for it! Amazing! Tell 
me, are you alone in Berlin?” 

“No, sir. Four of us are presently 
covering you. If your telephone 
rings twice, then stops, you must 
leave immediately by way of the 
fire escape. It would be prudent to 



38 



GALAXY 




gather your money and other indis- 
pensables together in the event they 
arrive before you finish packing.” 
Silverthome had found a reasona- 
ble weapon in the closet — a metal- 
framed oaken shoetree. He removed 
it from a tan-and-white wingtip 
brogue, setting it to one side. 

“An excellent idea! Pack these 
clothes, Steyr, while I collect the 
other things.” 

“Yes, sir.” Silverthome slipped 
the shoetree into his jacket pocket 
where it would be concealed by the 
clothing he was carrying to the bed. 
The tall man brought a chair from 
the vanity, standing on it to reach 
the closet’s high shelf. 

“What is it like, the future?” 
asked Lustmann without turning 
around. “I’ve speculated endlessly 
about what the world will be a cen- 
tury from now.” There was an ex- 
cited intensity in the question. 

Watching for his chance, Silver- 
thorne replied, “It’s simply our 
world, Herr Lustmann, thanks to 
yourself and Herr Doktor Lebe.” 
Lustmann nodded, handing down 
a pair of leather-covered notebooks 
and a metal strongbox. “You have 
seen Berlin, I take it?” 

“Twice, sir. I was there for the 
Games in two thousand sixty-six. 
Speer Stadium holds a quarter- 
million people. It’s larger than the 
stadium in Nuremberg. The city is 
more lovely, even, than Paris — 
wide tree-lined boulevards with the 
Great Hall, Goering’s Palace and 
Adolf Hitler’s Tomb dominating the 



skyline.” 

“Fascinating!” His headshake in- 
credulous, Lustmann turned full at- 
tention back to the closet. 

Silverthome lifted one foot to the 
bed. He rose silently, balancing 
himself, and drew out the shoetree. 
Then he sapped Lustmann a round- 
house blow behind the left ear. 

The tall man grunted loudly. He 
toppled off the chair, clawing des- 
perately at rows of neatly hung suits 
and topcoats, groping blindly for 
the Walther. 

In a frenzy Silverthome leaped 
down and struck him again with all 
his might. And again! Lustmann 
twitched once, twice, then lay still. 

Silverthome sagged on the bed, 
his chest heaving in short, agonized 
gasps. “Now ... it may be our 
world,” he choked. He took out a 
pen knife and cut a length of sash 
cord from the drawn venetial blinds. 
His hands were trembling almost 
uncontrollably. 

He stood above the prone figure, 
his face beaded with perspiration, 
and remembered Bernard Omsley, 
Henderson, Powell, Graham and all 
of the other truncated lives that had 
let to this moment. He knelt and did 
what had to be done, then rushed 
into the bathroom where he was 
violently ill. 

After Silverthome had bathed his 
face in cold water, he made an 
exhaustive search of the entire suite. 
Lustmann ’s death must be made to 
look like the result of simple rob- 
bery. 



MEMO TO THE LEADER 



39 




He took the man’s wallet, pock- 
eted the unbelievable amount of 
money he found in the unlocked 
strongbox and then examined the 
true treasures — leather-bound note- 
books that contained a long 
typewritten account of the authentic 
war. He kept the automatic pistol, 
the other’s cufflinks, rings, tie clasp 
and every scrap of identification he 
could locate. 

One unsavory task remained. 
Lips compressed with distaste, he 
pried apart the corpse’s jaws. 
Lustmann’s teeth were firm and 
regular, with few fillings. Cursing 
subvocally, Silverthome let go and 
wiped his fingers. What was he 
thinking of? Lustmann, returning to 
1940 from the seventh decade of 
the 20th century, would certainly 
not be equipped with an ultra- 
microminiaturized temporal return 
network like his own. 

He ripped open the dead man’s 
shirt. There it was: a crude metal 
band encircling the chest. Silver- 
thome stripped off the shirt. He 
could not take the risk that a 
policeman or a coroner might acci- 
dently trigger the network, though 
thoughts of their amazement at a 
cadaver vanishing before their very 
eyes made his lips twitch in 
amusement. If Lustmann’s body 
were to reappear in 1974, Erich 
Lebe would undoubtedly dispatch a 
replacement. 

As he closed the suite’s door 
after him, surprised at his own 
coolness, Silverthome felt a glow of 

40 



utter satisfaction. Lustmann’s death 
had already affected the myriad 
flow of space-time events once lead- 
ing to the Nazi tyranny hd had 
known all his life. He breezed down 
the stairs and out through the lobby 
unnoticed, the notebooks tucked 
casually under one arm, with money 
jammed into every jacket and 
trouser pocket. 

The automatic pistol and temporal 
return network went into the Spree 
as he crossed the Oberbaum Bridge 
on the way to his room. A delayed 
reaction set in after he got there, 
but the Schnapps helped allay his 
agitation, his quaking hands. With a 
historian’s insatiable curiosity, he 
delved into the notebooks at once, 
reading all through the night, forget- 
ting food, feeling not the least bit 
sleepy until dawnlight filtered 
through the dirty window. He 
stretched and rubbed his burning 
eyes, then fell into bed. 

At last he knew the actual history 
of World War II, first time 
around — England’s miraculous sal- 
vage of her armies from the beach 
at Dunkirk, the Luftwaffe frustration 
during the Battle of Britain, the Af- 
rika Korps’ agony and sorry end, 
Germany’s suicidal plunge into the 
vastnesses of European Russia, the 
sieges of Stalingrad and Leningrad, 
and the slow erosion of Wehrmacht 
effectiveness as supplies shrank and 
American arms production and wax- 
ing field strength made themselves 
felt on all fronts. Horrified, he 
learned of the conscienceless mur- 



GALAXY 




Horrified, he learned of the con- 
scienceless murder of millions of 
innocent Jews, Slavs, Gypsies and 
other non-combatant civilians, and 
lie found that the demi-god Adolf 
Hiller had not died of cancer after 
all .... 

He awoke at two o’clock in the 
afternoon and went out briefly for a 
bite to eat, then purchased a bottle 
of green ink and spent the remain- 
der of the day doggedly learning to 
imitate Lustmann’s florid pen- 
manship — no simple task. 

Bannerlines in next morning’s 
Hcobachter proclaimed the end of 
the “Twilight War.” Wehrmacht 
legions had burst across the Dutch 
and Belgian frontiers with devastat- 
ing suddenness. 

On May 12th, the day General 
von Kleist crossed the French bor- 
der, Silverthome posted his first let- 
ter to Zoltan, predicting Guderian’s 
armored thrust to Sedan — German 
infantry marching so swiftly that 
whole divisions reached the Meuse 
only days after the Panzers, cros- 
sing the river in the wake of satura- 
tion bombing by screaming Stukas. 
Then the sweep to the Channel 
Coast in mere days, outrunning the 
stunned, retreating British and 
French divisions that would be cut 
off and trapped in Belgium. 

He also made a first tentative stab 
at redirection, intimating that Bri- 
tain would “remain basically sym- 
pathetic to Germany’s inevitable in- 
vasion of the USSR” only if treated 
with due respect, further implying 



that His Majesty’s Government was 
already giving serious thought to re- 
lieving the thirteen divisions, soon 
to be isolated on the continent, by 
sea. 

He told them boldly that the 
Fiihrer alone had the wisdom and 
insight necessary to recognize the 
basic racial tie with England and 
that he would cannily halt Guder- 
ian’s armor in time to allow Britain 
to save face — and her armies. 

He posted the letter around four 
o’clock and went for a walk, stop- 
ping to read the paper over a beer. 
Then he headed back to his room, 
filled with gloomy premonitions 
about the Allied bombs soon to rain 
on Berlin. 

Silverthome unlocked the door. 
As he reached for the light switch, 
something hard smashed into his 
skull. There was a burst of bril- 
liance as the floor surged upward 
and struck his cheek painfully. 

As with the slow, underwater 
languidly of a dream, he felt brus- 
que hands roll him over on his 
back. He groaned. The room was 
dark. He could see only a shadowy 
figure bending over him. 

“I should kill you,” muttered a 
thickly accented voice. “Much safer 
but ... Hell, I owe you too great 
a debt!” 

Silverthome’s jaws were prized 
apart. He raised feeble hands to 
fend off the attacker but it was use- 
less. Fingers closed over the false 
bicuspid, twisting sharply. 

“Bon voyage, Herr Steyr!”

The convulsive, visceral-crawling 
sensation of temporal transition was 
the last thing Silverthome remem- 
bered. 

★ ★ ★ 

He was semi-conscious for a 
time, sprawling on the all-too- 
familiar padding of the reception 
chamber in Carlsbad Caverns. He 
sat up stiffly, rubbing his aching 
head, and then he fought to his 
knees. 

An alarm bell clanged in the dis- 
tance. He could hear the approach- 
ing sound of running footsteps. 

Silverthome had managed to gain 
his feet, knees wobbly and weak, 
head swimming, when the guards 
appeared. He stared at their sub- 
machine guns and slowly raised his 
arms. 

There were six of them — 
blockish, blank-faced oafs in baggy 
tan uniforms and jackboots. With a 
sinking feeling, Silverthome noted 
the red stars on their billed caps. 

A pudgy, sloppily dressed man of 
middle years pushed his way 
through the ring of guards. He re- 
garded Silverthome with unveiled 
skepticism and then said something 
in Russian. Silverthome shrugged 
and shook his head. 

“Don’t tell me another Nazi 
time-traveler has dropped into our 
midst!” the man said in fair Ger- 
man. “Did the whole German na- 
tion think to escape into the fu- 



ture?” 

Silverthome said defensively, 
“I . I’m an American.” 

The man chortled. He turned to 
the guards, hooting, “ Ameri - 
canski ! ’ ’ The guards laughed in 
appreciation and the man said, 
“No, my friend; I’m afraid that 
won’t wash. We’ve spent thousands 
of hours interrogating Nazi 
bunglers. We refuse to waste the 
time. We simply take them and 
stand them against the nearest con- 
venient wall.” 

“But I am American,” protested 
James Silverthome. The pudgy man 
looked growwly insulted. “Ridicul- 
ous! There has been no such thing 
as ‘American’ for . .” 

He broke off and peered at Sil- 
verthorne more intently. “Steyr? Is 
your name Hans Steyr?” 

“I . it’s a name I once used 
but — ” 

“Your papers led us to believe 
you were Austrian.” 

“My real name — my American 
name — is Silverthome.” 

“Hmm-m-, interesting.” The 
other’s brows lifted. “Let me 
apologize for disbelieving you. 
Welcome to the World Soviet, Herr 
Silverthome. Yuri Komarov made 
mention of you in his book — how 
he spared your life in view of the 
tremendous, though unwitting, con- 
tribution you made to our cause. 
You’re a much-discussed footnote 
to history. Our historical technicians 
have speculated at length about 
when you might turn up.” The man

GALAXY 





rattled something in staccato Rus- 
sian. “We’ll have to have another 
chat, later.” 

The guards marched him to a 
claustrophobic cell containing a rude 
bunk suspended by steel chains, a 
washbasin and a reeking zinc com- 
mode. Locking the barred cell door 
with a rattle, they left him, their 
footfalls echoing hollowly into still- 
ness. 

Silverthorne clapped both hands 
over his ears to drown the wave of 
sterile subterranean silence. He 
stared at rough jackhammer scores 
disfiguring the walls of living rock 
that surrounded him while his mind 
seethed and writhed and came full 
circle. It was like looking into an 



infinity of mirrors. 

Then he began to laugh. He 
rocked back on the lumpy, vermin- 
infested mattress, thumping his ach- 
ing head on unyielding rock, hold- 
ing his sides and roaring until tears 
streamed down his cheeks. 

What had Gauleiter Kastner said 
there in the vanished Weltanreich of 
2075? The reflexive danger of prom- 
iscuous time travel would be over- 
whelming. Overwhelming! 

Poor Kastner. Oh God, if Kastner 
had only known! 

Struggling for breath, Professor 
James Silverthorne laughed uncon- 
trollably at the futile idiocy of it all. 

It was the last time in his life he 
ever laughed. ★ 



MEMO TO THE LEADER 



43 




All they wanted was a 
little property for a 
shrine .... 



Most of the churches are 
closed now, although they remained 
open for a long time even after 
people found out the truth. I spend 
a lot of time on the terrace of my 
three-million-dollar villa in the 
Poconos though, staring at the stars 
and wondering how much they really 
knew and how much they really 
told us. 

The entire National Guard and 
most of the police force was already 
in place and you could hear the si- 
rens screaming from all the way 
down in the Village as the 
latecomers hurried to make the 
show, but they were going to be too 
late. A door slid open in the side of 
the spaceship, a ramp descended 
and out strolled the alien, calm as 
you please. There wasn’t a single 
raygun or snarling monster in sight. 
The kids were disappointed as hell. 

We’d been waiting since before 
six that morning. We lived right 
across the street from the park back 
then, in a chrome-and-plaster town- 
house we were too poor to afford 
and too socially conscious not to 
have. Davey first saw the thing sit- 
ting out by the lake about five in 
the morning — you’d think in a city 



this size someone would have seen 
or heard it land, but that just 
doesn’t seem to be the case — and he 
woke up the whole family, dragging 
us into his bedroom to look out the 
window at it. 

We got dressed and made it in- 
side the park before the police cor- 
don closed things off and when the 
Guardsmen came around about nine 
to chase everyone away, my U.N. 
pass seemed to muddy up the pic- 
ture sufficiently for them to allow 
us to stay. There were nearly a mil- 
lion people crowding around the 
park gates by noon, trying to find a 
way to worm in on the action, but 
Davey, Cliff and I were right there 
in the front row all along, waiting 
for the Big Moment. Then this 
second-rater from the next galaxy 
over trots out of his ship with the 
Historic Greeting and all he can 
come up with is “Good morning. 
I’d like to speak with someone in 
property management.” 

He got bad press from it. People 
expect Historic Greetings to be a lit- 
tle more weighty than something 
you might say to the receptionist at 
the neighborhood savings and loan. 
One magazine took it so seriously 
that it ran a contest asking its read- 
ers what the alien should have said, 
the purpose being, I suppose, to 
offer pointers to the next celestial 
visitor before he got a chance to 
ruin the moment. Folks would have 
been a lot happier with “Take me 
to your leader.” 

The guardsmen, of course, were 



THE ROAD TO GOD 



45 




in a perfect quandary over how to 
respond to his request. The com- 
mander of the Guard immediately 
called me over, his underlings hav- 
ing dutifully reported that a rep- 
resentative of the United Nations 
was in the gallery. His intentions, 
no doubt, were to handle the affair 
in a grandly cosmopolitan manner, 
and there could have been no action 
more appropriate — had the alien 
been interested in philately. 

The United Nations, as you may 
know, makes a tidy sum every year 
issuing its own postage stamps. It’s 
something the organization has in 
common with small individual na- 
tions like Monaco and Botswana; 
they have found printing pretty pic- 
tures with foul-tasting glue on the 
back can be more profitable than 
printing money. Once the U.N. au- 
thorizes a new stamp and it is 
drawn and perforated and the proper 
amount of gluck is spread liberally 
on the reverse, the project is turned 
over to me. I then write exciting re- 
leases for the stamp magazines, in- 
timating that any collection not in- 
cluding the new U.N. threepenny 
gold might just as well be burned. 
I’m sure N’Zom knew nothing 
about it. 

N’Zom, it turned out, was the 
alien’s name. I wasn’t excited about 
meeting him on a face-to-face 
basis — watching is one thing and 
negotiating another — but the Guards- 
men dragged me forward by the 
arm and the kids cheered and the 
reporters snapped photographs and 



who can deny a place in history 
when it is offered so graciously? 
Quivering in terror, I went over to 
the alien. 

N’Zom wasn’t really all that hor- 
rid to look at. In fact, he was rather 
interesting. He looked a little like a 
breadfruit and smelled a great deal 
like liverwurst. Eight spindly spider 
legs came out out of his underside 
and he had a tiny orange-colored 
head, covered with mucous that 
seemed to glide about the top of his 
torso. 

Beneath the mucous there were 
two dark spots where his eyes were 
probably located, although I have 
no idea how they were able to focus 
through that slime. I also have no 
idea where his voice came from, 
but it came. 

“My name is N’Zom,” the alien 
said, “and I come from the planet 
Morshle. We are very friendly 
people.” 

“My name is Albert Figg,” I 
told him, and one of the reporters in 
the back row asked loudly if I could 
spell it out for him. That took a 
moment but by the time I got 
around to resuming my conversation 
with N’Zom, I had my thoughts 
more properly in order and I was 
able to ask some intelligent 
questions. 

I asked him, “What brings you 
to Earth today?” 

“We have no wish to disturb 
your culture,” N’Zom said, glad to 
get down to business, “but we find 
it necessary to inquire of you the 



46 



GALAXY 




possibility of a real-estate transac- 
tion.” 

Now, Davey brings home a lot of 
science fiction and I read some of it 
occasionally, so I knew enough to 
realize that this was the point where 
things usually got sticky. The 
well-meaning earthling starts chat- 
ting with the emissary from Procyon 
and winds up selling the earth for 
$24 in interplanetary trinkets and 
throwing the rest of the interstellar 
neighborhood into the bargain as 
well. However I, as you may know, 
am no fool. 

“How much real estate?” I asked 
him. 

“A very small parcel, as remote 
as possible,” I was told. “If we 
understand your terminology, what 
we are looking for would be about 
five or six square miles.” 

This, perhaps, was a coincidence 
and some people have argued that 
case. Others claim it was predesti- 
nation, Divine Intervention or dumb 
luck. The fact of the matter was, I 
had done rather well in the U.N. 
stamp business and managed to set 
aside a good amount of my earnings 
for investment — in real estate. You 
meet some curious folks in any in- 
ternational organization and among 
my acquaintances was a certain in- 
dividual from Borneo named — well, 
his name isn’t as important as the 
fact that I’ve had a number of occa- 
sions in the past to buy parcels from 
him, entirely on speculation. Most 
of these were remote Pacific is- 
lands. Yolanda thought I was crazy 



when I first started to pick them up 
back in the 50s but it turns out to 
be among the shrewdest things I’ve 
done. The world’s becoming over- 
crowded rapidly, you see, and 
there’s precious little place to get 
away from it all. Therefore, those 
who can afford it, and my buyers 
range from movie stars to oil tsars, 
are more than happy to plunk down 
six figures for a hunk of basalt 
they’re going to have the devil’s 
own time getting to. And they hide 
out for a year or two and get bored 
and come home or else they start 
selling macadamia nuts and petrel 
guano and make their fortunes. It 
really makes little difference to me. 

I have, over the years, purchased 
twenty-two islands in the vicinity of 
Borneo that were quite livable but 
which my friend’s government 
could find no serious use for. I had 
sold twenty-one of them and, by a 
stroke of luck, had one remaining 
that was five or six square miles in 
area. I told N’Zom about it and he 
said this was just what he had in 
mind. 

“And how were you considering 
paying for this parcel?” I asked. 

N’Zom made a sound something 
like a belch and skittered back up 
the ramp into the spaceship. That 
surprised me a great deal since it 
had appeared things were going 
nicely and there didn’t seem to be 
grounds for his taking offense. I 
was wondering if he had been 
called in to administer some biolog- 
ical function when he reappeared on 



THE ROAD TO GOD 



47 




the ramp and scampered back to 
me, holding up his purchasing 
power. 

I didn’t recognize it at first. You 
don’t normally see diamonds that 
large. It was later remarked to me 
that this was a very logical means 
of exchange in the galaxy since 
diamonds are the crystallized form 
of one of the more common ele- 
ments, they are gradable into levels 
of greatly differing quality and, for 
unaesthetic races, they have con- 
siderable industrial application. 
N’Zom’s diamond was about the 
size of a clenched fist, probably not 
the biggest on record but assuredly 
the first from outer space and more 
than adequate for the purpose. It 
looked remarkably pure to my un- 
trained eye and I decided that if he 
wanted change, I was going to have 
a hard time coming up with it. 
When the stone finally was 
examined by a competent jeweler, I 
was told that N’Zom could have 
used it to buy something larger, like 
Hawaii, if anyone had been selling. 
But as I said before, I am no fool 
and I have read Davey’s science- 
fiction numbers. I wasn’t about to 
get caught on a bad deal. 

“Before we shake on it,” I told 
N’Zom, forgetting for the moment 
that none of his appendages seemed 
to contain anything he could shake 
with, “suppose you tell me what 
you’re planning to do with this site? 
Will you develop it in some man- 
ner?” 

“As I have said,” N’Zom as- 



sured me, “we have no desire to 
interfere with your culture. You are 
a young race and must develop in 
your own way, in your own time. 
For that reason, we will seal off our 
property so that our presence will 
not affect your progress.” 

“I appreciate your good inten- 
tions,” I said, “but before I sell the 
island. I’d like to know specifically 
what purpose you have in mind for 
the land.” 

“It is to be a stopping point for 
the Great Pilgrimage,” N’Zom said 
solemnly. “An oasis where our 
travelers may stop and rest and re- 
fuel on the Road to God.” 

The people around us stopped 
whispering and the park seemed to 
grow unnaturally quiet. A wind 
sprang up from somewhere and a 
cloud began to roll over the city. 
“The Road to God?” I asked. 

“It is our most important path- 
way through the stars,” N’Zom 
said. “A thousand races will follow 
it when it is completed. It will take 
them to the Almighty, the Creator 
of the Universe.” 

“You know where He is? That 
He exists?” 

“I can tell you no more,” 
N’Zorn replied, his voice softer. “It 
is something your race must dis- 
cover for itself, in its own time.” 
How could you stand in the way 
of something like that? Reluctantly, 
I took the diamond. 

Of course I got a lot of flak about 
it. People didn’t think it was right, 
selling property to aliens. At first 



48 



GALAXY 




there were rumbles about Congress 
taking action, invoking some sort of 
law to forbid Americans the right of 
“negotiating a treaty with foreign 
IKiwers, without the proper consent 
of the government.” Or something 
of the sort. It was then pointed out 
that Americans are constantly sell- 
ing things to other nations without 
the consent of Congress, with no 
question of unauthorized treaties. 
There was no differentiation in in- 
ternational law between selling to 
another country or another world, 
probably because no one had ever 
thought of it. I was also briefly 
supported by the argument that, as a ' 
representative of the United Na- 
tions, I paid no taxes to the United 
States government and was diplo- 
matically immune from its sanctions 
in matters of this nature. That really 
didn’t matter, though, because as 
soon as word got out, I was fired. 
T hat really didn’t matter either be- 
cause when I was fired, the 
diamond’s sale had already made 
me rich and people were beginning 
to come to me about book and 
movie rights. 

In the end it was decided to let 
the matter go. It didn’t seem right 
to try to renege on our very first 
deal with extra-terrestials. The 
‘‘Road to God” bit was getting to 
people as well. The Pope tried to 
rationalize it along church doctrine 
for a while and then gave up, dis- 
appearing behind the doors of the 
Vatican for the next three months 
while the College of Cardinals

Association 



struggled in vain trying to explain it 
to him. All sorts of religious groups 
formed to capitalize on the situa- 
tion, not the least of which was the 
Cosmic Hitchhikers Society, which 
believed they could get a ride on 
the Road to God by showing the 
aliens the proper beatific attitude, 
and the Glory Roaders, who 
claimed they’d already made the 
journey and had come back to 
spread The Truth. 

They were, all in their own ways, 
bonkers. 

The saucer stayed on for three 
days in the park so that N’Zom 
could, he said, reassure people that 
the Morshles had the best interests 
of Earth in mind. He even went on 
the Johnny Carson show to stress 



THE ROAD TO GOD 



49 





the point but unfortunately he came 
on after a pontifical sports 
announcer-cum-celebrity and never 
got the chance to say everything he 
wanted to. 

On the fourth morning the saucer 
was gone. No one saw it leave, 
which was particularly strange since 
the park was filled with people 
keeping a vigil on the ship and the 
National Guard was maintaining an 
armed watch around it, purely as a 
precautionary measure. People who 
claim to have stared right at the 
vessel all night long scratched their 
heads in bewilderment the next 
morning and said they just couldn’t 
find the moment in their memories 
when they realized it was gone. It 
made some of them very uneasy. 

The aliens didn’t come back to 
the park. That, of course, delighted 
the critics, who said we’d all been 
put upon by some prankster with a 
cardboard spaceship that had been 
dismantled in the dead of night and 
whisked away. That didn’t explain 
my diamond but people have a 
knack for disregarding facts that 
don’t properly fit their explanations. 

I was rich and the aliens were gone, 
along with their Road to God, and 
everyone was perfectly happy to 
leave it at that. 

Two years later The Lady Cap- 
ricorn out of Brisbane sank after 
running into a wall in the middle of 
the Pacific Ocean. It was my fault, 
really. 

When there was no further word 
from the visitors from outer space, I 



went ahead and sold the island 
again. There didn’t seem to be any 
other sensible options since no one 
had showed up to claim ownership. 
I’m the first to admit that I never 
really checked the situation but I 
thought I’d at least have heard if 
the aliens moved into the neighbor- 
hood. So, on December fourth I 
sold the property to Walter Marriott 
with the understanding that I would 
not inform his ex-wife Luella 
“where the damned rock’s at.” 
Walter boarded a plane headed to- 
ward the sunset and three weeks 
later they were yanking him out of 
the ocean, spitting fire and swearing 
he’d use me as shark bait at the ear- 
liest opportunity. I read his story in 
the newspapers shortly after arriving 
at my new hideaway villa near — the 
middle of the Poconos somewhere. 

Walter had arrived in Australia 
and quickly made the acquaintance 
of a beer-drinking sea captain 
named Theophelt Van Arsdale. 
Theo agreed to take him out to the 
island and keep quiet about it, and 
they set sail in The Lady Capricorn. 
On December fifteenth the captain 
was up before dawn and noticed a 
blue light near the horizon, in the 
shape of a hemisphere set low on 
the water. It was gone at sun-up 
and he wrote it off to the American 
beer Walter had brought along. 
They continued in that direction and 
late in the afternoon both men were 
standing on the flying bridge when 
Theo pointed out with interest that 
the sea ahead of them looked re- 



50 



GALAXY 




markably calm. It was a choppy day 
on the rest of the ocean, but the 
waves just ahead seemed to subside 
along an arcing line and beyond that 
(here were no waves at all. They 
were watching the line as The Lady 
( 'apricorn approached it, and sud- 
denly the entire bow of the craft 
buckled as if she had run full- 
ihrotlle into a seawall. The ship 
went straight to the bottom, taking 
I'lieo with her, but the impact threw 
their lorry free abaft and Walter 
managed to climb inside. He rode 
l lie currents for four days before he 
was found by a channel shrimper 
and brought back to civilization to 
tell his story. Everyone said he was 
sunstruck. 

Bizarre occurrences of this nature 
do attract attention though, and 
within a fortnight three vessels were 
steaming out of port for the 
island — one of them on the official 
investigation and two out to prove 
that the Bermuda Triangle had 
shifted to the Eastern Hemisphere. 

No one ever again heard from 
any of the passengers of the three 
ships. 

By the time the fourth ship was 
suspected lost, I figured I had to 
step in and remind folks that this 
was the same island 1 had sold to 
N’Zom two years earlier. I knew it 
wouldn’t set well with people but 
Yolanda insisted, and so I made an 
anonymous long-distance call to the 
Times, hoping they would carry the 
matter from there and be unable to 
find me. The next morning reporters 



were crawling all over the yard, 
trampling my begonias and taking 
pictures of Yolanda through the 
window. 

I really couldn’t tell them any- 
thing. I wasn’t the one who had 
been running into things in the 
Pacific, after all. It didn’t take long 
for the government to find me after 
the reporters had though, and by 
noon three black Cadillacs were roll- 
ing up the drive. Six carbon-copy 
men emerged from the three cars. 
Each wore a gray and olive-green 
sports jacket, herringbone, with 
solid gray slacks. Each had sunglass- 
es and each wore his blond hair 
just long enough to cover the pink 
of his scalp. I peered through the 
peephole in the door as they showed 
their government badges simulta- 
neously and then 1 opened the door 
for them. Only one spoke. 

“Mr. Figg, your government has 
need of you,” the gentleman said 
and in the background I thought, for 
an instant, I heard a band playing 
The Stars and Stripes Forever. 

They took me to New York. 
Then they took me to Washington, 
where they asked me questions at 
the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill. I 
couldn’t tell them anything new or 
informative about the aliens, the is- 
land or life in general, so they took 
me to Texas. At that point I was 
ready to confess to anything but 
they put me on a large plane and 
flew west. In Hawaii they put me in 
a smaller plane and flew south, and 
in Borneo they put me on the small- 



THE ROAD TO GOD 



51 




est plane of all and flew me over 
the island. 

We were, it seems, latecomers. 
The perimeter of ‘solid’ area had 
been pretty well determined by this 
time and an entire fleet had grown 
up around the limits of the calm wa- 
ter. There were $100, 000-yachts 
with captains sipping Scotch amid 
bevies of barely dressed beauties 
and there were foundering junks 
crowded with pilgrims who chanted, 
burned incense and danced about 
their decks in endless enthusiasm. 
They had all come to catch a 
glimpse of the Road to God. 

“Do you know what this means 
to them?” General Thurmond De- 
Vries asked at my left as the pilot 
banked to give me a good view 
through the windows. “There are a 
hundred boats down there and they 
just found out about it three days 
ago. In time, the sea will be choked 
with them. They all come to be 
near the pathway to God. A lot of 
them will die trying to get through, 
even though they know they can’t, 
because they can’t stand the thought 
that the path to Salvation is blocked 
to them.” 

“You say that as though it were 
my fault, General,” I said. “It 
isn’t, you know.” 

The general was quiet for a mo- 
ment, looking down at the boats. I 
watched as well and while I did, 
one of the junks cranked up and ran 
headlong into the invisible wall. 
There was a great deal of smoke 
and fire and, no doubt, loud noise. 



Several other boats drifted over to 
help but when the ship disappeared 
beneath the waves, I couldn’t see 
any bodies in the water. The gen- 
eral waved the pilot on. 

The plane, evidently, could fly 
over the calm water. I was sure the 
general would not have attempted it 
unless there had been a few previ- 
ous trial runs, and I remembered 
Walter’s mention of the blue sphere 
Theo had seen the night before his 
death. A dome-shaped field, 
perhaps? At one point I thought I 
saw a blackened, twisted piece of 
metal between ourselves and the 
water, as if floating on air, but I 
can’t be sure. It might have been a 
bird. 

The island came up slowly on the 
horizon and it was much smaller 
than I’d imagined. Later I found out 
that it was less than a square mile 
in area, a fact that quickly ended 
my relationship with the gentleman 
from Borneo. The area of calm wa- 
ter, however, extended a full five 
miles in every direction, a bit more 
than what they’d paid for, so things 
seemed to even out. 

You couldn’t see much on the is- 
land at first. The side we were ap- 
proaching rose sharply from the sea, 
marked by jagged peaks and verdant 
slopes. Then the plane went over 
the ridge. 

There was a city on the other side 
of the mountain. A city of gleaming 
orange spires that reached hundreds 
of meters into the sky. There were 
great domed structures that shone 



52 



GALAXY 




like polished silver and sinuous 
lubes that wound aimlessly around 
and through everything until the 
complex looked like New York City 
buried beneath a heap of spaghetti. 
The most impressive item, of 
course, was the port. It was a 
broad, flat area that seemed to be 
made of mirrorlike, fused sand, and 
on it stood a variety of vessels. 
There were tall, needle-shaped ships 
i hat stood on fins and reminded me 
of the renderings in the pulp 
magazines a decade or so before 
space flight. There were flying 
saucers as well, but there my profi- 
ciency as an extra-terrestial ship- 
spotter ended. There were things 
that resembled the insulators on an 
electric pole and things that looked 
like flowerpots and things that 
looked like frogs. There were things 
that looked like pied type and things 
l hat looked like amalgamations of 
assorted nails and things that didn’t 
look like anything at all. 

“They’re all spaceships,” the 
general said. “They keep coming 
and going so fast we can’t keep ac- 
curate numbers on them. But it’s a 
busy port, busier than O’Hare, and 
they’re all going, or coming from, 
somewhere. They’re going on the 
Road to God. ’ ’ 

I shifted uncomfortably in my 
seat. 

“It makes you wonder . what 
they know,” I suggested. It didn’t 
seem incredibly profound but it 
suited the general’s mood and he 
gave me a grunt of approval. 



“We know what they know, and 
that’s the problem, Figg. They 
know the truth. About God. Doesn’t 
that scare you?” 

“Scare me? Why should it scare 
me? I think it should be sufficient 
to know there is a truth and that 
God exists somewhere down the 
line.” 

“And that’s all you need to know 
about it?” 

“The aliens have made it pretty 
clear that’s all they’re telling us. I 
don’t see why I should have to 
know anything more. I mean, 
they're the ones who found Him. 
They should know what they’re do- 
ing.” 

The general stared at me for a 
moment and I confess that I was to- 
tally at a loss to determine what he 
was thinking. After he finished star- 
ing, he sucked in a deep breath and 
studied the ceiling of the plane for a 
while before he spoke again. 

“There are many people who 
don’t agree with you, Figg,” he 
said. “Governments are finding 
themselves faced with creeping 
anarchy. People are obsessed by the 
idea that this thing is here and they 
can’t get at it. It’s shaking a lot of 
faith. It’s bad for us to know — and 
not know. Can’t you understand 
that?” 

His eyes, for some reason, 
looked desperate despite the fact 
that we were engaged in an orderly, 
intellectual discussion. I decided it 
would be best if I let him ruminate 
by himself and merely said, “Then 



THE ROAD TO GOD

we shall have to try to live as best 
we can, knowing only what we 
know.” I think he caught my point 
because he was quiet all the way 
home. 

They took me back to Borneo, 
and back to Hawaii, and back to 
Texas and then back home. When I 
got there, Yolanda had left with the 
kids. There was a note on the re- 
frigerator saying she didn’t want 
anything to do with it any more. I 
spent the night drinking alone. 

The news in the morning was 
bad. A battleship from Korea had 
tried to blast its way through the 
barrier and ricocheting charges had 
demolished seventeen of the pilgrim 
yachts. There were riots in Rome, 
Buenos Aires, Calcutta, Madrid, 
Bangkok, Cedar Rapids. Absen- 
teeism rose. Factories were empty. 
Churches were full. 

Crime fell and apathy rose. In the 
streets we could see people roaming 
about aimlessly, their eyes glazed, 
staring at the sun, or at the pave- 
ment, but never glancing at one 
another. The military overthrew the 
government of India and declared 
the Kingdom of God. The clergy 
did the same thing, in slightly more 
revolutionary (and bloody) fashion, 
in Brazil. Things, as some were 
wont to say, were going straight to 
Hell. 

It did not come as a great sur- 
prise, then, when it was announced 
one morning that they’d dropped the 
Bomb on the island. The official at- 
titude was, “What the heck, we 



can’t live with them anyway.” 

And the Bomb worked. The pa- 
pers had pictures, three days later, 
of the devastation on the island. 
You really couldn’t tell that those 
ruins had once been the City on the 
Road to God rather than Dresden or 
Hiroshima. But I knew they were. I 
used to own the place. 

I found myself gripped with 
an overwhelming sadness. I drank 
quite a bit and when there was no 
more to drink, I would take long 
walks down the road to the canyon, 
where I would stand by the river 
near the falls and listen to the birds 
call me “Nit-Whit! Nit-Whit! 
Nit-whit!” 

Five days after the Bomb some- 
thing else joined the birds. There 
was a voice that called from the 
forest and said, “Hello, Figg. I’m 
sorry that it didn’t work out.” I 
turned — and it was N’Zom. 

His spaceship rested on the edge 
of the forest. His skin looked wrink- 
led and peeling. He might have 
been hurt but with N’Zorn it was 
hard to tell. 

“Hello,” I greeted him. “I’m 
glad the Bomb didn’t hurt you. I 
didn’t know they were planning to 
use it.” 

“I know that,” he said. “That’s 
why I knew it would be all right to 
come and say good-bye. You tried 
to do your best for us but it just 
wasn’t ordained to work out.” 

“I suppose you’ll set up another 
station, then, on the Road to God,” 
I suggested. “Someplace where they 



54 



GALAXY 





can't hurt you. On the Moon, 
maybe.” 

‘‘No. This station was essential. 
Hut we could not use it and as- 
sociate with you at the same time, 
and that’s what destroyed the 
dream. Perhaps it was our own prej- 
udices that destroyed it. In any 
event, we have to leave. Thank 
you, Figg.” 

I could tell he was getting ready 
io take off but I had been thinking 
about the things the general had 



said in the plane, and I delayed 
him. 

“N’Zom?” I called and he 
turned his eyespots toward me. “Do 
you really know where He is? You 
really found Him?” 

“Yes,” he replied, reverently. 
“Were? Can you tell me?” 
N’Zom paused for a moment as 
if thinking. Then he seemed to nod. 
“Yes, Figg,” he said. “Every road 
has its end, and this was ours. He 
was here.” ★ 



THE ROAD TO GOD 



55 






He always expected to return. But not this way 






UoCTOR HARRIMAN Came OUt of 
i lie bedroom and closed the door 
softly behind him. He showed wear- 
iness in his face and in the way he 
moved. His sparse white hair stood 
in rumpled confusion, and his face 
seemed to sag under the weight of 
the dark circles below his eyes. 
Marie was tired too, but on her it 
didn’t show. She was younger; that 
helped, but she was also excited. 

The doctor nodded as he sank 
down into an armchair. He accepted 
a glass, sipped cautiously and 
grimaced at the taste of Tequila. “I 
don’t suppose you’ve got anything 
decent?” he asked. 

Marie pushed aside a pile of 
books and produced another bottle. 
‘‘One sixty rum?” she offered. He 
sank deeper into the chair with a 
weary sigh. Marie took her own 
drink and sat in the chair facing 
him. She sipped quietly and waited. 

‘‘He’ll live,” Harriman said at 
last. “It was close: a couple of 
more hours without attention and he 
might not have. He’s asleep 
now, probably won’t wake for 
another twelve hours or so.” He 
looked at Marie, who refused to 
meet his eyes. 

“Thank God,” she said. “I was 
afraid I hadn’t got to him in time.” 
Her relief seemed genuine enough, 
but she still wouldn’t look at the 
doctor. 

“All right Marie, Who is he?” 

“I can’t tell you.” She played 
with her drink and looked at the 
floor. “I really appreciate your 

COME AGAIN 



coming down here, Matt, and cer- 
tainly you deserve an explanation, 
but it’s important that no one know 
who he is until the proper time.” 
She looked up and this time their 
eyes met. “You’ve got to believe 
me,” she pleaded. 

“Oh, I believe you.” he said 
mildly. “But it doesn’t make any 
difference. You call me away from 
my dinner to come down here. You 
insist that I treat this man here in- 
stead of taking him to a hospital 
where by all rights he belongs. All 
right, you’re an old friend and he 
needed help, not arguments. That 
much I’ll do for you. But this man 
has been beaten, stabbed, tortured, 
and drugged. He’s suffering from 
shock and exposure. He didn’t get 
that way accidentally; someone 
wanted him to die and to die pain- 
fully. Unless you can give me a 
very good explanation for what 
happened to him and why he is 
here, when I leave this house I’m 
going straight to the police.” 

Marie opened her mouth to ar- 
gue, but his expression told her that 
it would be useless. She surren- 
dered. “Okay, but it’s a long story 
and we’re both pretty tired. Why 
don’t we get some sleep first? You 
can use my guest room. In the 
morning I’ll tell you the whole 
story.” 

“Now Marie.” The voice left no 
room for dispute. She considered 
for a moment, then: “What do you 
know about time travel?” 

“Nothing.” 

57 




“Except that it’s impossible,” 
she prompted. 

“And that you’re about to tell me 
it’s not.” 

“Right. According to theory 
there is no reason why the temporal 
flow has to be in only one direction: 
any physicist will tell you that the 
mathematics don’t exclude it. In my 
own lab we’ve gotten results that 
can’t be explained any other way. 
Of course we call it temporal 
phenomenon instead of time travel, 
and we worked with atomic parti- 
cles and fractions of a second, but 
there’s no doubt that the results 
were real. We applied for a grant to 
study it but no one would take us 
seriously. Fortunately there are 
other ways to get research money 
besides grants. There are, for in- 
stance, private fortunes.” 

“Your own?” Harriman asked. 
He knew that Marie had inherited 
several million dollars and that this 
sum had grown considerably since 
then. 

She shrugged. “What else have I 
got to do with my money? Anyway, 
we have since learned that the effect 
doesn’t have to be restricted to 
small particles or short lengths of 
time.” She glanced over her shoul- 
der at the doorway. “Down that 
hall is a working time machine.” 
She paused to wait for the doctor’s 
reaction, but there was none. Fi- 
nally she went on. 

“Actually it’s primarily a viewer. 
There’s a screen and by setting the 
controls properly, I can watch any 

58 



event that has ever happened. It 
also has the capability of projecting 
an object up to about three hundred 
pounds through time but it takes a 
great deal of energy. So far it has 
been done twice, three times if you 
count the return trip.” She paused 
again. 

“You’re a hard man to impress, 
Matt,” she said. “I tell you that 
I’ve traveled in time and you don’t 
even bat an eye. Congratulate me. 
Tell me I’m crazy. Say some- 
thing!” 

“I’m sceptical.” 

She nodded. “Well, I guess 
that’s something. All right, Matt, 
suppose you had a machine that 
could look into the past. What 
would you look at first?” 

“I don’t know. Famous events, I 
suppose. Kennedy’s assassination, 
the crucifixion, the storming of the 
Bastille, construction of the pyra- 
mids, the fall of Troy.” 

“I’ve seen them 'all,” she told 
him. She went to a table in the 
comer of the room and picked up a 
copy of the New Testament. “Do 
you know how long Jesus was on 
the cross?” she asked. 

“A day?” Dr. Harriman guessed. 

“Four hours. Do you know how 
long it usually took the victim of 
crucifixion to die?” 

“No.” 

“Three or four days. Why do 
you think Jesus died so fast?” 

“1 don’t know.” 

Marie opened the book and began 
to read. “ ‘And about the ninth 



GALAXY 




hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, 
saying, E’-li, E'-li, La’-ma sa- 
vuch-tha-nH That is to say, My 
(iod, my God, why hast thou for- 
saken me? Some of them that stood 
ihere, when they heard that, said, 
this man calleth for E-li’-as. And 
straightaway one of them ran and 
look a sponge and filled it with vin- 
egar, and put it on a reed, and gave 
him to drink. The rest said, Let be. 
Let us see whether E-li’-as will come 
to save him. Jesus, when he had 
cried again with a loud voice, 
yielded up the ghost.’ Matthew. 

“It was common to use a dilute 
mixture of water and vinegar to re- 
vive the victim,” Marie explained, 
“though it seems not to have helped 
here.” She flipped through the 
pages and began reading again. 

“ ‘Then came the soldiers, and 
brake the legs of the first and of the 
other which was crucified with him. 
But when they came to Jesus, and 
saw that he was dead already, they 
brake not his legs. But one of the 
soldiers with a spear pierced his 
side, and forthwith came there out 
blood and water. ’ John. 

“The legs of the other two were 
broken to speed their deaths, ’ ’ Marie 
said. “It was required that the 
bodies be taken down before the 
beginning of the Sabbath.” She turned 
the pages again and began reading 
once more. 

“ ‘And Pilate marveled if he 
were already dead: and calling unto 
him the centurion, he asked him 
whether he had been any while dead.’ 



Mark.” 

She closed the book and sat 
down. After a while Dr. Harriman 
spoke. 

“He wasn’t dead?” 

“No.” 

“And the man in the bed- 
room. .” 

“Is Jesus of Nazareth.” She 
finished the statement. “One thing 
the gospels were wrong about. It 
was a woman who gave the vinegar 
to Jesus, and the vinegar was drug- 
ged. That was the first time I used 
the machine to transport a person. 
When he was taken down and 
placed in the tomb, I used it again to 
bring him here. Then I called you.” 

“Do you really expect me to be- 
lieve this?” Dr. Harriman asked. 

“No,” she replied. “But then, 
you insisted that I tell you.” 

She took him down the hall to a 
room filled with banks of electronic 
equipment. There was a television 
screen mounted above a control 
consol where she sat. Harriman 
stood behind her and watched. The 
screen lit up to show three men 
lashed to scaffolding on the top of a 
hill. A crowd of people milled 
around below, and a handlettered 
sign was nailed above the center fig- 
ure. Part of it was in Latin and 
said, “this is the king of the 
jews.” The rest was in two differ- 
ent languages, presumably giving 
the same message. 

“You’ll notice,” Marie said, 
“that he was crucified on a perma- 
nent scaffolding rather than an actual 



COME AGAIN 



59 




cross. Also, there are no nails. We 
know that the usual practice was to 
tie the victim, but tradition has it 
that in the case of Jesus they used 
nails. As you can see, they didn’t.” 

She was about to say something 
more when the man on the screen 
cried out. The doctor couldn’t un- 
derstand what he said, but a figure, 
heavily draped in white robes, step- 
ped out of the crowd and lifted a 
sponge on the end of a stick. Jesus 
drank from it, cried something, and 
went limp. Harriman studied the 
robed figure that had offered the 
drink, but was unable to recognize 
Marie or even determine the gender. 

During the next half hour Marie 
showed him the Kennedy assassina- 
tion (there was only one gunman), 
the signing of the Declaration of In- 
dependence, part of the Gettysburg 
Address, the assassination of 
Caesar, and Galileo dropping balls 
from a tower. 

‘‘This is fascinating,” he said at 
last, ‘‘but it proves nothing. I have 
no way of knowing whether all this 
is authentic. You can sit here and 
show me history all night, but for 
all I know, it could be just film clips 
on videotape.” 

Marie adjusted the controls again 
and the screen showed a darkened 
hospital room with an old woman 
sleeping fitfully on the bed. The 
room brightened briefly as the door 
opened to admit a man wearing a 
white coat. Dr. Hardman recog- 
nized himself. He had one hand in 
his pocket, and when he neared the 



woman, he withdrew a syringe. He 
stood looking at the woman for a 
moment and then stooped, inserted 
the needle, and injected the contents 
of the syringe into her arm. 
“Stop!” he shouted. 

The screen went blank and Marie 
turned to find the doctor pale and 
trembling. “She had terminal 
cancer.” he said with an unsteady 
voice. “She was in pain every min- 
ute. Would have lived another few 
weeks maybe, no more. She asked 
her doctor to let her die, but he re- 
fused.” He finally tore his gaze 
away from the blank screen and 
looked at Marie. “No one ever 
knew,”- he said. 

They went back to the study 
where Marie poured him another 
drink. “What would have happened 
if you went through the machine 
and stopped me from killing her?” 
he asked. “Or if you stopped Os- 
wald or killed your grandmother?” 
he added, beginning to realize the 
implications of what he had seen. 

Marie shook her head. “I don’t 
know. I haven’t tried to change any- 
thing. I don’t know what would 
happen if I did.” 

Harriman looked at her incredu- 
lously. “You haven’t tried to change 
anything?” he repeated. “No, of 
course not. You just snatched Jesus 
Christ is all.” 

“But I didn’t change anything,” 
she insisted. “The first time I 
watched the crucifixion it was 
exactly as you saw it. I watched 
myself give him the drug and I saw 



60 



GALAXY 




him pass out. I was even recorded 
by witnesses two thousand years 
ago. And the body did disappear. I 
would have been changing history 
by not going.” 

Harriman considered this for a 
while, but it was too much to fol- 
low. If she hadn’t taken the body, 
she would have been changing his- 
tory because back then she had 
taken it — or at least somebody 
had — but if she stopped Oswald, it 
was different because she hadn’t. 
He gave it up. 

“You don’t believe in Jesus, do 
you?” he asked. 

“Of course I believe in him. 
He’s right there in the next room.” 

“Yes, but you don’t believe that 
he is God, or even the Messiah?” 

“No.” 

“Then why did you do it? Why 
bring him here? If he had died on 
the cross and remained in his tomb, 
there might never have been a 
Christian religion. You’re not Chris- 
tian. You don’t even like Chris- 
tians. I’ve heard you denounce them 
as narrow-minded, intolerant bigots. 
Yet here you’ve gone and created 
the whole basis for their beliefs. 
Why?” 

She shrugged. “The bigots would 
be bigots anyway. If they weren’t 
Christian bigots, they’d be Moslem 
bigots or Jewish bigots. It doesn’t 
make any difference what they 
believe — just so they don’t have to 
think. But Jesus, now there was an 
interesting person. How could I 
pass up the chance to talk to him? 



Besides, the set-up was too perfect. 
I’m watching the crucifixion and 
someone dressed so that he can’t 
possibly be recognized walks up 
and administers what is obviously a 
drug; there was absolutely no ques- 
tion that he had been knocked out. 
And there I was with everything 
that was needed to make it all hap- 
pen, just as it was written, and 
there was nothing at all mysterious 
or miraculous about it. I can go to 
the believers and say, ‘Look, here’s 
your great miracle, and I did it. Not 
God, just me.’ ” 

“So now you’ve brought him 
back. I hope you don’t regret it. 
Remember, regardless of what you 
think, he believes that he’s the 
Messiah. The fact that he’s been res- 
urrected and brought back after 
two thousand years is not likely to 
convince him otherwise. Nor any- 
one else for that matter.” 

“That’s ridiculous. He hasn’t 
been resurrected. He never died. I 
have simply transported him 
through time.” 

“Yes, well I wish you the best of 
luck in explaining that, both to him 
and to his followers.” He paused to 
consider. “It will be interesting to 
see what he thinks of those who are 
supposed to be- his followers. And 
what they think of him.” Dr. Har- 
riman rose from his chair. “Well, 
I’ll let you worry about that. I’m 
tired and I think I’ll be getting 
home. Call me when he wakes up 
tomorrow. I’d like to be here when 
you tell him your name.” ★

the Courts of 
\ Chaos 

v 

-Roger Zelazny 



All depends on the 
Pattern 



WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

Hell. I was irritated with Dad. 
Now that he was back. I’d expected 
some answers. Instead, he began 
the secrecy routine again: private 
orders for just about everyone — 
except me— before he took off 
again, destination unstated. I de- 
cided to go and sulk in the library. 
Random finally came by with lunch 
and tried to persuade me that 
perhaps Dad knew what he was do- 
ing, that perhaps my feelings had a 
deeper source than the present situ- 
ation. All right. I was willing to 
concede that but I was still irri- 
tated. Random persuaded me to 
quit the library, though, and ac- 
company him downstairs to check 
on Martin, regarding whom Dad 
had said something typically cryptic 
on taking his leave. 

Below, we witnessed a peculiar 
tableau in the throne room. Barred 
by some unnatural agency from en- 
tering, we saw Martin, Benedict 
and Dara within, Dara seated upon 
the throne. Gerard was finally 
forced to acknowledge her ex- 
istence. There followed a reenact- 
ment of the situation in which / had 
participated in Tir-na Nog’th, the 
city in the sky. My blade Grays- 
wandir appeared, as I had wielded 
it then, and engaged in battle with 
Benedict, finally striking from him 
the marvelous prosthesis he was 
using for a right arm — the object I 
had obtained in just that fashion 
from his ghostly double in that 



strange place of dreams. The arm 
and the blade vanished then and the 
force that restrained us was with- 
drawn. 

Within, from Martin’s peculiar 
Trumps, I learned of the existence 
of Merlin, my son by Dara — the 
strange youth whom I had encoun- 
tered at the Courts of Chaos and 
who had declined a clear shot at me 
after he learned who I was. 

Dara, Benedict, Random, 
Gerard, Martin and I adjourned 
then for a private discussion. I 
learned that Dara had lied to me 
about many things. She had ar- 
ranged our meeting in a very calcu- 
lated fashion so that I could beget 
Merlin. 

White I was hardly in a position 
to cry rape over it, I felt more than 
a little used. Dara hastened to as- 
sure us that she was no longer in 
complete sympathy with her 
superiors’ plans — although she 
seemed to favor the part that in- 
volved seeing Merlin on the throne 
of Amber. Brand had been a mere 
tool of the Courts. I gathered, his 
ambitions greater than his abilities 
to fulfill them. 

Dara was not really for either 
side any longer, she said, although 
she professed a great liking for 
Dad. She then surprised us all by 
producing his signet ring and com- 
mencing to issue orders in his 
name — orders for such things as an 
immediate attack on the Courts of 
Chaos, to be led by Benedict. 

We were not about to accept this 
situation so, suspecting that Dad 
might be conferring with Dworkin 
at the primal Pattern, we contacted 
Fiona there. She confirmed that this 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS 



65 




indeed was the case. Fiona also 
told me of her suspicion that Dad 
was going to try to repair the Pat- 
tern. She felt that no matter whether 
he succeeded or failed, he would be 
destroyed in the process. / asked 
her to find out if he had sent orders 
via Dara. When she got in touch 
with us later, she was in his pres- 
ence and she confirmed that he had. 
/ asked her to trump me through, 
which she did. 

I spoke with Dad and was able to 
distract him sufficiently to permit 
me to snatch the Jewel of Judgment 
from him. Then / beat it out of 
Dworkin’s quarters and headed 
down to the Pattern, where / in- 
tended to use the gem in an attempt 
to repair it myself. They were able 
to stop me, though. They reached 
through the Jewel and used it to 
paralyze me. 

Dad retrieved the stone — and we 
had a talk. He told me of how he 
had once known the real Ganelon 
and why he had been forced to kill 
him. He revealed that he had turned 
the entire land of Lorraine into a 
trap with which to test me. He told 
me that it was he who had killed 
Benedict’s servants, explaining that 
he had done it as part of a scheme 
whereby Dara and / would become 
lovers. He approved of the union. 
He had decided that I was to be his 
successor and Dara my queen. 

Then I told him of my own deci- 
sion; namely, that / did not want 
the throne. / believe he was shaken 
by this. He sent me back to Amber, 
telling me to prepare for a trip on 
horseback and to await his orders 
at an isolated spot outside the city. 
I did this, parting with Dara on 



better terms than / had thought 
I would. 

/ rode out to my tomb and 
waited. When Dad got in touch with 
me, he created a familiar red bird 
from my blood — a creature that 
would bring me the Jewel, wherever 
/ might be, when he was through 
with it. Then he charged me to ride 
for the Courts of Chaos through 
Shadow as fast as / could go. 

I began this journey — a hard 
hellride — with reality swimming 
about me. I realized that I had to 
stay ahead of a wave of Chaos that 
would arise with the Pattern’s inter- 
ruption. After I had gone some dis- 
tance, the bird finally caught up 
with me, bringing me the Jewel. 
The time differential was such, 
though, that I would not know the 
results of Dad’s efforts until later. 
And the Trumps no longer 
functioned because of the twisting 
reality had taken. 

/ rode on with the Jewel. Every- 
thing was fine until Brand trapped 
me within a circle of fire in a 
desolate, rocky location and de- 
manded the Jewel. I managed to 
elude him, however , and continued 
on for a great distance. When I 
halted again, I was in a metallic 
garden spot in the middle of 
nowhere — and Brand was waiting. 

This time he wanted to talk. 1 de- 
cided to hear him out. He told me 
that Dad had failed in his attempt 
to repair the Pattern and had 
perished in the process. He said 
that Amber was fallen as a result 
and that all the Shadow worlds 
were being destroyed as the wave of 
Chaos spread outward from where 
the Pattern had once stood. There

was only one way to preserve things 
now, he insisted. I was to attune 
him to the Jewel in a manner he de- 
scribed to me and then surrender 
the stone to him so that he might 
quickly inscribe a new Pattern to 
save the day. 

However, / had my suspicions as 
to what he truly intended to do with 
the Jewel. I felt it probable that he 
wanted it as a weapon to use 
against us; or conceivably he might 
want to use it to create a second 
Pattern, one that would give him 
his own private universe. Even had 
he been telling the truth, he was 
certainly not the person I wanted to 
see create the new Pattern; half- 
mad as I now felt him to be, I de- 
clined his offer. A few more bitter 
words were added to the many we 
had exchanged over the years. I 
moved to confront him physically. 
He departed. 

/ rode on, growing dangerously 
weary. Finally I had to stop to eat 
and rest. I located a mountain cave, 
had a cold supper, wrapped myself 
in my cloak and a blanket, arid 
slept. 

PART II 



v. 

I was awakened by a sense of 
presence. Or maybe it was a noise 
and a sense of presence. Whatever, 
I was awake and I was certain that I 
was not alone. I tightened my grip 
on Grayswandir and opened my 
eyes. Beyond that, I did not move. 



A soft light, like moonlight, 
came in through the cavemouth. 
There was a figure, possibly hu- 
man, standing just inside. The light- 
ing was such that I could not tell 
whether it faced me or faced out- 
ward. But then it took a step toward 
me. 

I was on my feet, the point of my 
blade toward its breast. It halted. 

“Peace,” said a man’s voice, in 
Than. “I have but taken refuge 
from the storm. May I share your 
cave?” 

“What storm?” I asked. 

As if in answer, there came a roll 
of thunder followed by a gust of 
wind, bearing the smell of rain 
within it. 

“Okay, that much is true,” I 
said. “Make yourself comfortable.” 

He sat down, well inside, his 
back against the righthand wall of 
the cave. I folded my blanket for a 
pad and seated myself across from 
him. About four meters separated 
us. I located my pipe and filled it, 
then tried a match that had been 
with me from the shadow Earth. It 
lit, saving me a lot of trouble. The 
tobacco had a good smell, mixed 
with the damp breeze. I listened to 
the sounds of the rain and regarded 
the dark outline of my nameless 
companion. I thought over some 
possible dangers, but it had not 
been Brand’s voice that had ad- 
dressed me. 

“This is no natural storm,” the 
other said. 

“Oh? How so?” 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS 



67 




“For one thing, it is coming out 
of the north. They never come out 
of the north, here, this time of 
year. ’ ’ 

“That’s how records are made.” 
“For another, I have never seen a 
storm behave this way. I have been 
watching it advance ail day — just a 
steady line, moving slowly, front 
like a sheet of glass. So much 
lightning, it looks like a monstrous 
insect with hundreds of shiny legs. 
Most unnatural. And behind it, 
things have grown very distorted.” 
“That happens in the rain.” 

“Not that way. Everything seems 
to be changing its shape. Flowing. 
As if it is melting the world — or 
stamping away its forms.” 

I shuddered. I had thought that I 
was far enough ahead of the dark 
waves that I could take a little rest. 
Still, he might be wrong, and it 
could just be an unusual storm. But 
I did not want to take the chance. I 
rose and turned to the rear of the 
cave. I whistled. 

No response. 1 went back and 
groped around. 

“Something the matter?” 

“My horse is gone.” 

“Could it have wandered off?” 
“Must have. I’d have thought 
Star’d have better sense, though.” 

I went to the cavemouth but 
could see nothing. I was half- 
drenched in the instant I was there. 
I returned to my position beside the 
left wall. 

“It seems like an ordinary 
enough storm to me,” I said. 

68 



“They sometimes get pretty bad in 
the mountains.” 

“Perhaps you know this country 
better than I do?” 

“No, I am just traveling 
through — a thing I had better be 
continuing soon, too.” 

I touched the Jewel. I reached 
into it, then through it, out and up, 
with my mind. I felt the storm 
about me and ordered it away, with 
red pulses of energy corresponding 
to my heartbeats. Then I leaned 
back, found another match and relit 
my pipe. It would still take a while 
for the forces I had manipulated to 
do their work, against a stormfront 
of this size. 

“It will not last too long,” I 
said. 

“How can you tell?” 

“Privileged information.” 

He chuckled. 

“According to some versions, 
this is the way that the world 
ends — beginning with a strange 
storm from out of the north.” 

“That’s right,” I said, “and this 
is it. Nothing to worry about, 
though. It will be all over, one way 
or the other, before too long.” 

“That stone you are wear- 
ing .. it is giving off light.” 
“Yes.” 

“You were joking about this 
being the end, though — were you 
not?” 

“No.” 

“You make me think of that line 
from the Holy Book: The Archangel 
Corwin shall pass before the storm. 



GALAXY 




lightning upon his breast .... You 
would not be named Corwin, would 
you?” 

‘‘How does the rest of it go?” 

“. When asked where he 
travels, he shall say, ‘To the ends 
of the Earth,’ where he goes not 
knowing what enemy will aid him 
against another enemy, nor whom 
the Horn will touch.” 

‘‘That’s all?” 

‘‘All there is about the Archangel 
Corwin.” 

“I have run into this difficulty 
with Scripture in the past. It tells 
you enough to get interested, but 
never enough to be of any im- 
mediate use. It is as though the au- 
thor gets his kicks by tantalizing. 
One enemy against another? The 
Hom? Beats me.” 

“Where do you travel?” 

“Not too far, unless I can find 
my horse.” 

I returned to the cavemouth. It 
was letting up now, with a glow 
like a moon behind some clouds to 
the west, another to the east. I 
looked both ways along the trail and 
down the slope to the valley. No 
horses anywhere in sight. I turned 
back to the cave. Just as I did, 
however, I heard Star’s whinny far 
below me. 

I called back to the stranger in 
the cave, “I have to go. You can 
have the blanket.” 

I do not know whether he re- 
plied, for I moved off into the driz- 
zle then, picking my way down the 
slope. Again I exerted myself 



through the Jewel, and the drizzle 
halted, to be replaced by a mist. 

The rocks were slippery, but I 
made it halfway down without 
stumbling. I paused then, both to 
catch my breath and to get my bear- 
ings. From that point, I was not cer- 
tain as to the exact direction from 
which Star’s whinny had come. The 
moonslight was a little stronger, vis- 
ibility a bit better, but I saw nothing 
as I studied the prospect before me. 
I listened for several minutes. 

Then I heard the whinny once 
more — from below, to my left, near 
a dark boulder, cairn or rocky out- 
crop. There did seem to be some 
sort of turmoil in the shadows at its 
base. Moving as quickly as I dared, 
I laid my course in that direction. 

As I reached level ground and 
hurried toward the place of the ac- 
tion, I passed pockets of ground 
mist, stirred slightly by a breeze 
from out of the west, snaking sil- 
very, about my ankles. I heard a 
grating, crunching sound, as of 
something heavy being pushed or 
rolled over a rocky surface. Then I 
caught sight of a gleam of light, 
low on the dark mass I was ap- 
proaching. 

Drawing nearer, I saw small, 
manlike forms outlined in a rec- 
tangle of light, struggling to move 
a great rocky slab. Faint echoes of a 
clattering sound and another whinny 
came from their direction. Then the 
stone began to move, swinging like 
the door that it probably was. The 
lighted area diminished, narrowed 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS 



69 




to a sliver, vanished with a boom- 
ing sound, all of the struggling fig- 
ures having first passed within. 

When I finally reached that rocky 
mass, all was silent once again. I 
pressed my ear to the stone, but 
heard nothing. Whoever they were, 
they had taken my horse. I had 
never liked horse thieves, and I had 
killed my share in the past. And 
right now I needed Star as I had 
seldom needed a horse. So I groped 
about, seeking the edges of that 
stony gate. 

It was not too difficult to describe 
its outlines with my fingertips. I 
probably located it sooner than I 
would have by daylight, when ev- 
erything would have blended and 
merged more readily to baffle the 
eye. Knowing its situation, I sought 
further then, after some handhold 
by which I might draw it. They had 
seemed to be little guys, so I looked 
low. 

I finally discovered what might 
have been the proper place and 
seized hold of it. I pulled then, but 
it was stubborn. Either they were 
disproportionately strong or there 
was a trick to it that I was missing. 

No matter. There is a time for 
subtlety and a time for brute force. 
I was both angry and in a hurry, so 
the decision was made. 

I began to draw upon the slab 
once again, tightening the muscles 
in my arms, my shoulders, my 
back, wishing Gerard were nearby. 
The door creaked. I kept pulling. 
It moved slightly — an inch, per- 



haps — and stuck. I did not slacken, 
but increased my effort. It creaked 
again. 

I leaned backward, shifted my 
weight and braced my left foot 
against the rocky wall at the side of 
the portal. I pushed with it as I 
drew back. There was more creak- 
ing and some grinding as it moved 
again — another inch or so. Then it 
stopped and I could not budge it. 

I released my grip and stood, 
flexing my arms. Then I put my 
shoulder to it and pushed the door 
back to its fully closed position. I 
took a deep breath and seized it 
again. 

I put my left foot back where it 
had been. No gradual pressure this 
time. I yanked and shoved simulta- 
neously. 

There was a snapping sound and 
a clattering from within, and the 
door came forward about half a 
foot, grinding as it moved. It 
seemed freer now, though, so I got 
to my feet, reversed my position — 
back to wall — and found sufficient 
purchase to push it outward. 

It moved more easily this time, 
but I could not resist placing my 
foot against it as it began to swing 
and thrusting forward as hard as I 
could. It shot through a full 
hundred-eighty degrees, slammed 
back against the rock on the other 
side with a great booming noise, 
fractured in several places, swayed, 
fell, and struck the ground with a 
crash that made it shudder, breaking 
off more fragments when it hit.

GALAXY 




Grayswandir was back in my 
hand before it struck, and I had 
dropped into a crouch and stolen a 
quick look about the comer. 

Light . there was illumination 
beyond . from little lamps de- 
pending from hooks along the 
wall . beside the stairway . 
going down ... to a place of great- 
er light and some sounds . like 
music .... 

There was no one in sight. I 
would have thought that the 
godawful din I had raised would 
have caught someone's attention, 
but the music continued. Either the 
sound — somehow — had not carried, 
or they did not give a damn. Either 
way .... 

I rose and stepped over the 
threshold. My foot struck against a 
metal object. I picked it up and 
examined it. A twisted bolt. They 
had barred the door after them- 
selves. I tossed it back over my 
shoulder and started down the stair. 

The music — fiddles and pipes — 
grew louder as I advanced. From 
the breaking of the light, I could 
see that there was some sort of hall 
off to my right, from the foot of the 
stair. They were small steps and 
there were a lot of them. I did not 
bother with stealth, but hurried 
down to the landing. 

When I turned and looked into 
the hall, I beheld a scene out of 
some drunken Irishman’s dream. In 
a smoky, torchlit hall, hordes of 
meter-high people, red-faced and 
green-clad, were dancing to the 



music or quaffing what appeared to 
be mugs of ale while stamping their 
feet, slapping tabletops and each 
other, grinning, laughing and shout- 
ing. 

Huge kegs lined one wall, and 
a number of revelers were 
queued up before the one that had 
been tapped. An enormous fire 
blazed in a pit at the far end of the 
room, its smoke being sucked back 
through a crevice in the rock wall, 
above a pair of cavemouths running 
anywhere. Star was tethered to a 
ring in the wall beside that pit, and 
a husky little man in a leather apron 
was grinding and honing some 
suspicious-looking instruments. 

Several faces turned in my direc- 
tion, there were shouts and sud- 
denly the music stopped. The si- 
lence was almost complete. 

I raised my blade to an overhand 
epee en garde position, pointed 
across the room toward Star. All 
faces were turned in my direction 
by then. 

“I have come for my horse,” I 
said. “Either you bring him to me 
or I come and get him. There will 
be a lot more blood the second 
way.” 

From off to my right, one of the 
men, larger and grayer than most of 
the others, cleared his throat. 

“Begging your pardon,” he be- 
gan, “but how did you get in 
here?” 

“You will be needing a new 
door,” I said. “Go and look if you 
care to, if it makes any differ- 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS

ence — and it may. I will wait.” 

I stepped aside and put the wall 
to my back. 

He nodded. 

“I will do that.” 

And he darted by. 

I could feel my anger-bom 
strength flowing into and back out 
of the Jewel. One part of me 
wanted to cut and slash and stab my 
way across the room, another 
wanted a more humane settlement 
with people so much smaller than 
myself; and a third, and perhaps 
wiser, part suggested that the little 
guys might not be such pushovers. 
So I waited to see how my door- 
opening feat impressed their 
spokesman. 

Moments later, he returned, giv- 
ing me wide berth. 

“Bring the man his horse,” he 
said. 

A sudden flurry of conversation 
occurred within the hall. I lowered 
my blade. 

“My apologies,” said the one 
who had given the order. “We de- 
sire no trouble with the like of you. 
We will be foraging elsewhere. No 
hard feelings, I hope?” 

The man in the leather apron had 
untethered Star and started in my 
direction. The revelers drew back 
to make way as he led my mount 
through the hall. 

I sighed. 

“I will just call it a day and for- 
give and forget,” I said. 

The little man seized a flagon 
from a nearby table and passed it to 

72 



me. Seeing my expression, he sip- 
ped from it himself. 

“Join us in a drink, then?” 

“Why not?” I said, and I took it 
and quaffed it as he did the same 
with a second one. 

He gave a gentle belch and 
grinned. 

“ ’Tis a mighty small draught for 
a man of your size,” he said. “Let 
me fetch you another, for the trail.” 

It was a pleasant ale, and I was 
thirsty after my efforts. 

“All right,” I said. 

He called for more as Star was 
delivered to me. 

“You can wrap the reins around 
this hook here,” he said, indicating 
a low projection near the doorway, 
“and he will be safe out of the 
way.” 

I nodded and did that as the 
butcher withdrew. No one was star- 
ing at me any longer. A pitcher of 
the brew arrived and the little man 
refilled our flagons from it. One of 
the fiddlers struck up a fresh tune. 
Moments later, another joined him. 

“Sit a spell,” said my host, 
pushing a bench in my direction 
with his foot. “Keep your back to 
the wall as you would. There will 
be no funny business.” 

I did, and he rounded the table 
and seated himself across from me, 
the pitcher between us. It was good 
to sit for a few moments, to take 
my mind from my journey for just a 
little while, to drink the dark ale 
and listen to a lively tune. 

“I will not be apologizing 

GALAXY 




again,” said my companion, “nor 
explaining either. We both know it 
was no misunderstanding. But you 
have got the right on your side, it is 
plain to see.” He grinned and 
winked. “So I am for calling it a 
day, too. We will not starve. We 
will just not feast tonight. ’Tis a 
lovely jewel you are wearing. Tell 
me about it?” 

“Just a stone,” I said. 

The dancing resumed. The voices 
grew louder. I finished my drink 
and he refilled the flagon. The fire 
undulated. The night’s cold went 
out of my bones. 

“Cozy place you’ve got here,” I 
said. 

“Oh, that it is. Served us for 
time out of mind, it has. Would you 
be liking the grand tour?” 

“Thank you, no.” 

“I did not think so, but ’twas my 
hostly duty to offer. You are wel- 
come to join in the dancing, too, if 
you wish.” 

I shook my head and laughed. 
The thought of my cavorting in this 
place brought me images out of 
Swift. 

“Thanks anyway.” 

He produced a clay pipe and pro- 
ceeded to fill it. I cleaned my own 
and did the same. Somehow all 
danger seemed past. He was a gen- 
ial enough little fellow, and the 
others seemed harmless now with 
their music and their stepping. 

Yet ... I knew the stories from 
another place, far, so far from 
here .... To awaken in the morn- 



ing, naked, in some field, all traces 
of this spot vanished ... I knew, 
yet ... 

A few drinks seemed small peril. 
They were warming me now, and 
the keening of the pipes and the 
wailings of the fiddles were pleasant 
after the brain-numbing twistings of 
the hellride. I leaned back and puff- 
ed smoke. I watched the dancers. 

The little man was talking, talk- 
ing. Everyone else was ignoring 
me. Good. I was hearing some fan- 
tastic yam of knights and wars and 
treasures. Though I gave it less than 
half an ear, it lulled me, even drew 
a few chuckles. 

Inside, though, my nastier, wiser 
self was warning me: All right, 
Corwin, you have had enough. 
Time to take your leave .... 

But, magically it seemed, my 
glass had been refilled, and I took it 
and sipped from it. One more, one 
more is all right. 

No, said my other self, he is lay- 
ing a spell on you. Can’t you feel 
it? 

I did not feel that any dwarf 
could drink me under the table. But 
I was tired, and I had not eaten 
much. Perhaps it would be pru- 
dent .... 

I felt myself nodding. I placed 
my pipe on the table. Each time 
that I blinked it seemed to take 
longer to reopen my eyes. I was 
pleasantly warm now, with just the 
least bit of delicious numbness in 
my tired muscles. 

I caught myself nodding, twice. I 

73 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS 




tried to think of my mission, of my 
personal safety, of Star ... I 
mumbled something, still vaguely 
awake behind closed eyelids. It 
would be so good, just to remain 
this way half a minute more .... 

The little man’s voice, musical, 
grew monotonous, dropped to a 
drone. It did not really matter what 
he was say — 

Star whinnied. 

I sat bolt upright, eyes wide, and 
the tableau before me swept all 
sleep from my mind. 

TTie musicians continued their 
performance, but now no one was 
dancing. All of the revelers were 
advancing quietly upon me. Each 
held something in his hand — a 
flask, a cudgel, a blade. The one in 
the leather apron brandished his 
cleaver. My companion had just 
fetched a stout stick from where it 
had leaned against the wall. Several 
of them lofted small pieces of furni- 
ture. 

More of them had emerged from 
the caves near the fire-pit, and they 
bore stones and clubs. All traces of 
gaiety had vanished, and their faces 
were now either expressionless, 
twisted into grimaces of hate, or 
smiling very nasty smiles. 

My anger returned, but it was not 
the white-heat thing I had felt earli- 
er. Looking at the horde before me, 
I had no wish to tackle it. Prudence 
had come to temper my feelings. I 
had a mission. I should not risk my 
neck here if I could think of another 
way of handling things. But I was 



certain that I could not talk my way 
out of this one. 

I took a deep breath. I saw that 
they were getting ready to rush me, 
and I thought suddenly of Brand 
and Benedict in Tir-na Nog’th, 
Brand not even fully attuned to the 
Jewel. I drew strength from that 
fiery stone once again, growing 
alert and ready to lay about me if it 
came to that. But first I would 
have a go at their nervous systems. 

I was not certain how Brand had 
managed it, so I simply reached out 
through the Jewel as I did when in- 
fluencing the weather. Strangely, 
the music was still playing, as 
though this action of the little 
people was but some grisly continu- 
ation of their dance. 

“Stand still.” I said it aloud and 
willed it, rising to my feet. 
“Freeze. Turn to statues. All of 
you.” 

I felt a heavy throbbing within- 
upon my breast. I felt the red forces 
move outward, exactly as on those 
other occasions when I had em- 
ployed the Jewel. 

My dimunitive assailants were 
poised. The nearest ones stood 
stock-still, but there were still some 
movements among those to the rear. 
Then the pipes let out a crazy 
squeal and the fiddles fell silent. 
Still, I did not know whether I had 
reached them or whether they had 
halted of their own accord on seeing 
me stand. 

Then I felt the great waves of 
force that flowed out from me, 



74 



GALAXY 




embedding the entire assembly in a 
tightening matrix. I felt them all 
trapped within this expression of my 
will, and I reached out and un- 
tethered Star. 

Holding them with a concentra- 
tion as pure as anything I used 
when passing through Shadow, I led 
Star to the doorway. I turned then 
for a final look at the frozen assem- 
bly and pushed Star on ahead of me 
up the stair. As I followed, I lis- 
tened, but there were no sounds of 
renewed activity from below. 

When we emerged, dawn was al- 
ready paling the east. Strangely, as 
I mounted, I heard the distant 
sounds of fiddles. Moments later, 
the pipes came in on the tune. It 
seemed as though it mattered not at 
all whether they succeeded or failed 
in their designs against me; the 
party was going to go on. 

As I headed us south, a small fig- 
ure hailed me from the doorway I 
had so recently quitted. It was their 
leader, with whom I had been drink- 
ing. I drew rein, to better catch his 
words. 

“And where do you travel?” he 
called after me. 

Why not? 

“To the ends of the Earth!” I 
shouted back. 

He broke into a jig atop his shat- 
tered door. 

“Fare thee well, Corwin!” he 
cried. 

I waved to him. Why not, in- 
deed? Sometimes it’s damned hard 
to tell the dancer from the dance. 



VI. 

I rode fewer than a thousand 
meters to what had been the south, 
and everything stopped — ground, 
sky, mountains. I faced a sheet of 
white light. I thought then of the 
stranger in the cave and his words. 
He had felt that the world was 
being blotted out by that storm, that 
it corresponded to something out of 
a local apocalyptic legend. Perhaps 
it had. Perhaps it had been the wave 
of Chaos of which Brand had spo- 
ken, moving this way, passing over, 
destroying, disrupting. But this end 
of the valley was untouched. Why 
should it remain? 

Then I recalled my actions on 
rushing out into the storm. I had 
used the Jewel, the power of the 
Pattern within it, to halt the storm 
over this area. And if it had been 
more than an ordinary storm? The 
Pattern had prevailed over Chaos 
before. Could this valley where I 
had stopped the rainfall be but a 
small island in a sea of Chaos now? 
If so, how was I to continue? 

I looked to the east, from whence 
the day brightened. No sun stood 
new-risen in the heavens, but rather 
a great, blindingly burnished crown, 
a gleaming sword hanging through 
it. From somewhere I heard a bird 
singing, notes almost like laughter. 
I leaned forward and covered my 
face with my hands. Madness .... 

No! I had been in weird shadows 
before. The farther one traveled, the 
stranger they sometimes grew. Un-

til ... What was it I’d thought that 
night in Tir-na Nog’th? 

Two lines from a story of Isak 
Dinesen’s returned to me, lines 
that had troubled me sufficiently 
to cause me to memorize them, de- 
spite the fact that I had been Carl 
Corey at the time: “. Few 

people can say of themselves that 
they are free of the belief that this 
world which they see around them 
is in reality the work of their own 
imagination. Are we pleased with it, 
proud of it, then?” 

A summation of the family’s 
favorite philosophical pastime. Do 
we make the Shadow worlds? Or 
are they there, independent of us, 
awaiting our footfalls? Or is there 
an unfairly excluded middle? Is it a 
matter of more or less, rather than 
either-or? A dry chuckle arose sud- 
denly as I realized that I might 
never know the answer for certain. 

Yet, as I had thought that night, 
there is a place, a place where there 
comes an end to Self, a place where 
solipsism is no longer the plausible 
answer to the locales we visit, the 
things that we find. The existence 
of this place, these things, say that 
here, at least, there is a difference, 
and if here, perhaps it runs back 
through our shadows, too, inform- 
ing them with the not-self, moving 
our egos back to a smaller stage. 

For this, I felt, was such a place, 
a place where the “Are we pleased 
with it, proud of it then?” need not 
apply, as the rent vale of Gamath 
and my curse might have nearer 



home. Whatever I ultimately be- 
lieved, I felt that I was about to 
enter the land of the completely 
not-I. My powers over Shadow 
might well be canceled beyond this 
point. 

I sat up straight and squinted 
against the glare. I spoke a word to 
Star and shook the reins. We moved 
ahead. 

For a moment, it was like riding 
into a fog. Only it was enormously 
brighter, and there was absolutely 
no sound. Then we were falling. 

Falling, or drifting. After the ini- 
tial shock, it was difficult to say. 
At first there was a feeling of 
descent — perhaps intensified by the 
fact that Star panicked when it be- 
gan. But there was nothing to kick 
against, and after a time Star ceased 
all movement save for shivering and 
heavy breathing. 

I held the reins with my right 
hand and clutched the Jewel with 
my left. I do not know what I willed 
or how I reached with it, exact- 
ly, but I wanted passage through 
this place of bright nothingness, 
to find my way once more and 
move on to the journey’s end. 

I lost track of time. The feeling 
of descent had vanished. Was I 
moving, or merely hovering? No 
way to say. Was the brightness re- 
ally brightness, still? And that dead- 
ly silence ... I shuddered. Here 
was even greater sensory depriva- 
tion than in the days of my blind- 
ness, in my old cell. Here was 
nothing — not the sound of a scut-

tling rat nor the grinding of my 
spoon against the door; no damp- 
ness, no chill, no textures. I con- 
tinued to reach .... 

Flicker. 

It seemed there had been some 
momentary breaking of the visual 
field to my right, near-subliminal in 
its brevity. I reached out and felt 
nothing. 

It had been so brief a thing that I 
was uncertain whether it had really 
occurred. It could easily have been 
an hallucination. 

But it seemed to happen again, 
this time to my left. How long the 
interval between, I could not say. 

Then I heard something like a 
groan, directionless. This, too, was 
very brief. 

Next — and for the first time, I 
was certain — there came a gray and 
white landscape like the surface of 
the moon. There and gone, perhaps 
a second’s worth, in a small area of 
my visual field, off to my left. Star 
snorted. 

To my right appeared a forest — 
gray and white— tumbling, as 
though we passed one another at 
some impossible angle. A small- 
screen fragment, less than two sec- 
onds’ worth. 

Then pieces of a burning building 
beneath me . colorless .... 

Snatches of wailing, from over- 
head .... 

A ghostly mountain, a torchlit 
procession ascending a switchback 
trail up its nearest face .... 

A woman hanging from a 

78 



treelimb, taut rope about her neck, 
head twisted to the side, hands tied 
behind her back .... 

Mountains, upside-down, white; 
black clouds beneath .... 

Click. A tiny thrill of vibration, 
as if we had momentarily touched 
something solid— Star’s hoof on 
stone, perhaps. Then gone .... 

Flicker. 

Heads, rolling, dripping black 
gore ... a chuckle from nowhere 
... a man nailed to a wall, up- 
side-down .... 

The white light again, rolling and 
heaving, wave-like .... 

Click. Flicker. 

For one pulsebeat, we trod a trail 
beneath a stippled sky. The moment 
it was gone, I reached for it again, 
through the Jewel. 

Click. Flicker. Click. Rumble. 

A rocky trail, approaching a high 
mountain pass .... Still mono- 
chrome, the world ... at my back, 
a crashing like thunder .... 

I twisted the Jewel like a focus 
knob as the world began to fade. 
It came back again. ... Two, 
three, four ... I counted hoofbeats, 
heartbeats against the growling 
background .... Seven, eight, 
nine ... the world grew brighter. I 
took a deep breath and sighed heav- 
ily. The air was cold. 

Between the thunder and its 
echoes, I heard the sound of rain. 
None fell upon me, though. 

I glanced back. 

A great wall of rain stood 
perhaps a hundred meters to the 

GALAXY 




rear. I could only distinguish the 
dimmest of mountain outlines 
through it. I clucked to Star and we 
moved a little faster, climbing to an 
almost level stretch that led between 
a pair of peaks like turrets. The 
world ahead was still a study in 
black and white and gray, the sky 
before me divided by alternate 
bands of darkness and light. We en- 
tered the pass. 

I began to tremble. I wanted to 
draw rein, to rest, eat, smoke, dis- 
mount and walk around. Yet, I was 
still too close to that stormscreen to 
so indulge myself. 

Star’s hoofbeats echoed within 
the pass, where rock walls rose 
sheer on either hand beneath that 
zebra sky. I hoped these mountains 
would break this stormfront, though 
I felt that they could not. This was 
no ordinary storm, and I had a sick 
feeling that it stretched all the way 
back to Amber, and that I would 
have been trapped and lost forever 
within it but for the Jewel. 

As I watched that strange sky, a 
blizzard of pale flowers began to 
fall about me, brightening my way. 
A pleasant odor filled the air. The 
thunder at my back softened. The 
rocks at my sides were shot with 
silver streaks. The world was pos- 
sessed of a twilight feeling to match 
the illumination, and as I emerged 
from the pass, I saw down into a 
valley of quirked perspective, dis- 
tances impossible to gauge, filled 
with natural-seeming spires and 
minarets reflecting the moonlike 



light of the sky-streaks, reminiscent 
of a night in Tir-na Nog’th, in- 
terspersed with silvery trees, spotted 
with mirror-like pools, traversed by 
drifting wraiths, almost terraced- 
seeming in places, natural nad roll- 
ing in others, cut by what appeared 
to be an extension of the line of 
trail I followed, rising and falling, 
hung over by an elegiac quality, 
sparked with inexplicable points of 
glitter and shine, devoid of any 
signs of habitation. 

I did not hesitate, but began my 
descent. The ground about me here 
was chalky and pale as bone — and 
was that the faintest line of a black 
road far off to my left? I could just 
about make it out. 

I did not hurry now, as I could 
see that Star was tiring. If the storm 
did not come on too quickly, I felt 
that we might take a rest beside one 
of the pools in the valley below. I 
was tired and hungry myself. 

I kept a lookout on the way 
down, but saw no people, no ani- 
mals. The wind made a soft, sigh- 
ing noise. White flowers stirred on 
vines beside the trail when I 
reached the lower levels where reg- 
ular foliage began. Looking back, I 
saw that the stormfront still had not 
passed the mountain crest, though 
the clouds continued to pile behind 
it. 

I made my way on down into that 
strange place. The flowers had long 
before ceased to fall about me, but 
a delicate perfume hung in the air. 
There were no sounds other than 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS

our own and that of the constant 
breeze from my right. Oddly shaped 
rock formations stood all about me, 
seeming almost sculpted in their 
purity of line. The mists still 
drifted. The pale grasses sparkled 
damply. 

As I followed the trail toward the 
valley’s wooded center, the perspec- 
tives continued to shift about me, 
skewing distances, bending pros- 
pects. In fact, I turned off the trail 
to the left to approach what ap- 
peared to be a nearby lake and it 
seemed to recede as I advanced. 
When I finally came upon it, how- 
ever, dismounted and dipped a fin- 
ger to taste, the water was icy but 
sweet. 

Tired, I sprawled after drinking 
my fill, to watch Star graze while I 
began a cold meal from my bag. 
The storm was still fighting to cross 
the mountains. I looked for a long 
while, wondering about it. If Dad 
had failed, then those were the 
growls of Armageddon and this 
whole trip was meaningless. It did 
me no good to think that way, for I 
knew that I had to go on, whatever. 
But I could not help it. I might ar- 
rive at my destination, I might see 
the battle won, and then see it all 
swept away. Pointless .... No. Not 
pointless. I would have tried, and I 
would keep on trying to the end. 
That was enough, even if every- 
thing was lost. Damn Brand, any- 
way! For starting — 

A footfall. 

I was into a crouch and I was 

80 



turned in that direction with my 
hand on my blade in an instant. 

It 'was a woman that I faced, 
small, clad in white. She had long, 
dark hair and wild, dark eyes, and 
she was smiling. She carried a 
wicker basket which she placed on 
the ground between us. 

“You must be hungry, Knight at 
arms,” she said in strangely ac- 
cented Thari. “I saw you come. I 
brought you this.” 

I smiled and assumed a more 
normal stance. 

“Thank you,” I said. “I am. I 
am called Corwin. Yourself?” 

“Lady,” she said. 

I quirked an eyebrow. “Thank 
you — Lady. You make your home 
in this place?” 

She nodded and knelt to uncover 
the basket. 

“Yes, my pavilion is farther 
back, along the lake.” She gestured 
with her head, eastward — in the di- 
rection of the black road. 

“I see,” I said. 

The food and the wine in the 
basket looked real, fresh, appetiz- 
ing, better than my traveler’s fare. 
Suspicion was with me, of course. 
“You will share it with me?” I 
asked. 

“If you wish.” 

“I wish.” 

“Very well.” 

She spread a cloth, seated herself 
across from me, removed the food 
from the basket and arranged it be- 
tween us. She served it then, and 
quickly sampled each item herself. I 

GALAXY 




felt a trifle ignoble at this, but only 
a trifle. It was a peculiar location 
lor a woman to be residing, appar- 
ently alone, just waiting around to 
succor the first stranger who hap- 
pened along. Dara had fed me on 
our first meeting, also; and as I 
might be nearing the end of my 
journey, I was closer to the enemy’s 
places of power. The black road 
was too near at hand, and I caught 
Lady eyeing the Jewel on several 
occasions. 

But it was an enjoyable time, and 
we grew more familiar as we dined. 
She was an ideal audience, laughing 
at all my jokes, making me talk 
about myself. She maintained eye 
contact much of the time, and 
somehow our fingers met whenever 
anything was passed. If I were 
being taken in in some way, she 
was being very pleasant about it. 

As we had dined and talked, I 
had also kept an eye on the progress 
of that , inexorable-seeming storm- 
front. It had finally breasted the 
mountain crest and crossed over. It 
had begun its slow descent of the 
high slope. As she cleared the 
cloth, Lady saw the direction of my 
gaze and nodded. 

“Yes, it is coming,” she said, 
placing the last of the utensils in 
the basket and seating herself beside 
me, bringing the bottle and our 
cups. “Shall we drink to it?” 

“I will drink with you, but not to 
that.” 

She poured. 

“It does not matter,” she said. 



“Not now,” and she placed her 
hand on my arm and passed me my 
cup. 

I held it and looked down at her. 
She smiled. She touched the rim of 
my cup with her own. We drank. 

“Come to my pavilion now,” 
she said, taking my hand, “where 
we will while pleasurably the hours 
that remain.” 

“Thanks,” I said. “Another time 
and that whiling would have been a 
fine dessert to a grand meal. Unfor- 
tunately, I must be on my way. 
Duty nags, times rushes, I’ve a 
mission.” 

“All right,” she said. “It is not 
that important. And I know all 
about your mission. It is not all that 
important either, now.” 

“Oh? I must confess that I fully 
expected you to invite me to a pri- 
vate party that would result in me 
alone and palely loitering on the 
cold side of some hill sometime 
hence if I were to accept.” 

She laughed. 

“And I must confess that it was 
my intention to so use you, Corwin. 
No longer, though.” 

“Why not?” 

She gestured toward the advanc- 
ing line of disruption. 

“There is no need to delay you 
now. I see by this that the Courts 
have won. There is nothing anyone 
can do to halt the advance of the 
Chaos.” 

I shuddered briefly and she refill- 
ed our cups. 

“But I would rather you did not 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS

leave me at this time,” she went 
on. “It will reach us here in a mat- 
ter of hours. What better way to 
spend this final time than in one 
another’s company? There is no 
need even to go as far as my pavil- 
ion.” 

I bowed my head, and she drew 
up close against me. What the hell. 
A woman and a bottle — that was 
how I had always said I wanted to 
end my days. I took a sip of the 
wine. 

She was probably right. Yet, 
I thought of the woman-thing that 
had trapped me on the black road as 
I was leaving Avalon. I had gone at 
first to aid her, succumbed quickly 
to her unnatural charms — then, 
when her mask was removed, saw 
that there was nothing at all behind 
it. Damned frightening, at the time. 
But, not to get too philosophical, 
everybody has a whole rack of 
masks for different occasions. I 
have heard pop psychologists in- 
veigh against them for years. Still, I 
have met people who impressed me 
favorably at first, people whom I 
came to hate when I learned what 
they were like underneath. And 
sometimes they were like that 
woman-thing — with nothing much 
really there. I have found that the 
mask is often far more acceptable 
than its alternative. So . this 
girl I held to me might really be a 
monster inside. Probably was. 
Aren’t most of us? I could think of 
worse ways to go if I wanted to 
give up at this point. I liked her. 

82 



I finished my wine. She moved 
to pour me more and I stayed her 
hand. 

She looked up at me. I smiled. 

“You almost persuaded me,” I 
said. 

Then I closed her eyes with 
kisses four, so as not to break the 
charm, and I went and mounted 
Star. The sedge was not withered, 
but he was right about the no birds. 
Hell of a way to run a railroad, 
though. 

“Good-bye, Lady.” 

* ★ ★ 

I headed south as the storm 
boiled its way down into the valley. 
There were more mountains before 
me, and the trail led toward them. 
The sky was still streaked, black 
and white, and these lines seemed 
to move about a bit; the overall ef- 
fect was still that of twilight, 
though no stars shone within the 
black areas. Still the breeze, still 
the perfume about me — and the si- 
lence, and the twisted monoliths 
and the silvery foliage, still dew- 
damp and glistening. Rag-ends of 
mist blew before me. I tried to 
work with the stuff of Shadow, but 
it was difficult and I was tired. 
Nothing happened. I drew strength 
from the Jewel, trying to transmit 
some of it to Star, also. We moved 
at a steady pace until finally the 
land tilted upward before us, and 
we were climbing toward another 
pass, a more jagged thing than the 



GALAXY 




one by which we had entered. I 
halted to look back, and perhaps a 
ihird of the valley now lay behind 
the shimmering screen of that ad- 
vancing storm-thing. I wondered 
about Lady, her lake, her pavilion. 

I shook my head and continued on. 

The way steepened as we neared 
(he pass, and we were slowed. 
Overhead, the white rivers in the 
sky took on a reddish cast that 
deepened as we rode. By the time 
that I reached the entrance, the 
whole world seemed tinged with 
blood. Passing within that wide, 
rocky avenue, I was struck by a 
heavy wind. Pushing on against it, 
the ground grew more level beneath 
us, though we continued to climb 
and I still could not see beyond the 
pass. 

As I rode, something rattled in 
the rocks to my left. I glanced that 
way, but saw nothing. I dismissed it 
as a falling stone. Half a minute 
later, Star jerked beneath me, let 
out a terrible neigh, turned sharply 
to the right, then began to topple, 
leftward. 

I leaped clear, and as we both 
fell, I saw that an arrow protruded 
from behind Star’s right shoulder, 
low. I hit the ground rolling, and 
when I halted, I looked up in the di- 
rection from which it must have 
come. 

A figure with a crossbow stood 
atop the ridge to my right, about ten 
meters above me. He was already 
cranking the weapon back to pre- 
pare for another shot. 



I knew that I could not reach him 
in time to stop him. So I cast about 
for a stone the size of a baseball, 
found one at the foot of the escarp- 
ment to my rear, hefted it and tried 
not to let my rage interfere with the 
accuracy of my throw. It did not, 
but it may have contributed some 
extra force. 

The blow caught him on the left 
arm, and he let out a cry, dropping 
the crossbow. The weapon clattered 
down the rocks and landed on the 
other side of the trail, almost di- 
rectly across from me. 

“You son of a bitch!” I cried. 
“You killed my horse! I’m going to 
have your head for it! ’ ’ 

As I crossed the trail, I looked 
for the fastest way up to him and 
saw it off to my left. I hurried to it 
and commenced climbing. An in- 
stant later, the light and the angle 
were proper and I had a better view 
of the man, bent nearly double, 
massaging his arm. It was Brand, 
his hair even redder in the sanguine 
light. 

“This is it, Brand,” I said. “I 
only wish someone had done it a 
long time ago.” 

He straightened and watched me 
climb for a moment. He did not 
reach for his blade. Just as I got to 
the top, perhaps seven meters away 
from him, he crossed his arms on 
his breast and lowered his head. 

I drew Grayswandir and ad- 
vanced. I admit that I was prepared 
to kill him in that or any other posi- 
tion. The red light had deepened

until we seemed bathed in blood. 
The wind howled about us, and 
from the valley below came a rum- 
ble of thunder. 

He simply faded before me. His 
outline grew less distinct, and by 
the time I reached the place where 
he had been standing, he had van- 
ished entirely. 

I stood for a moment, cursing, 
remembering the story that he had 
somehow been transformed into a 
living Trump, capable of transport- 
ing himself anywhere in a very brief 
time. 

I heard a noise from below .... 

I rushed to the edge and looked 
down. Star was still kicking and 
blowing blood, and it tore my heart 
to see it. But that was not the only 
distressing sight. 

Brand was below. He had picked 
up the crossbow and begun prepar- 
ing it once more. 

I looked about for another stone, 
but there was nothing at hand. Then 
I spotted one farther back, in the di- 
rection from which I had come. I 
hurried to it, resheathed my blade 
and raised the thing. It was about 
the size of a watermelon. I returned 
with it to the edge and sought 
Brand. 

He was nowhere in sight. 

Suddenly I felt very exposed. He 
could have transported himself to 
any vantage and be sighting in on 
me at that instant. I dropped to the 
ground, falling across my rock. A 
moment later I heard the bolt strike 
to my right. The sound was fol- 



lowed by Brand’s chuckle. 

I stood again, knowing it would 
take him at least a little while to re- 
cock his weapon. Looking in the di- 
rection of the laughter, I saw him, 
atop the ledge across the pass from 
me — about five meters higher than I 
and about twenty meters distant. 

“Sorry about the horse,” he said. 
I was aiming for you. But those 
damned winds 

By then 1 had spotted a niche and 
I made for it, taking the rock with 
me for a shield. From that wedge- 
shaped fissure, I watched him fit 
the bolt. 

“A difficult shot,” he called out, 
raising the weapon, “a challenge to 
my marksmanship. But certainly 
worth the effort. I’ve plenty more 
quarrels.” 

He chuckled, sighted and fired. 

I bent low, holding the rock be- 
fore my middle, but the bolt struck 
about two feet to my right. 

“I had sort of guessed that might 
happen,” he said, beginning to pre- 
pare his weapon once again. “Had 
to leam the windage, though.” 

I looked about for smaller stones 
to use for ammunition as I had ear- 
lier. 

There were none nearby. I won- 
dered about the Jewel then. It was 
supposed to act to save me in the 
presence of immediate peril. But I 
had a funny feeling that this in- 
volved close proximity, and that 
Brand was aware of this and was 
taking advantage of the phenome- 
non. Still, mightn’t there be some- 



84 



GALAXY 




thing else I could do with the Jewel 
to thwart him? He seemed too far 
away for the paralysis trick, but I 
had beaten him once before by con- 
trolling the weather. I wondered 
how far off the storm was. I 
reached for it. I saw that it would 
take minutes I did not possess in 
order to set up the conditions neces- 
sary to draw lightning upon him. 
But the winds were another matter. 
1 reached out for them, felt 
them .... 

Brand was almost ready to shoot 
again. The wind began to scream 
through the pass. 

I do not know where his next 
shot landed. Nowhere near me, 
though. He fell to readying his 
weapon again. I began setting up 
the factors for a lightningstroke .... 

When he was ready, when he 
raised the weapon this time, I raised 
the winds once more. I saw him 
sight, I saw him draw a breath and 
hold it. Then he lowered the bow 
and stared at me. 

“It just occurred to me,” he 
called out, “you’ve got that wind in 
your pocket, haven’t you? That is 
cheating, Corwin.” He looked all 
about. “I should be able to find a 
footing where it will not matter, 
though. Aha!” 

I kept working to set things up to 
blast him, but conditions were not 
ready yet. I looked up at that red- 
and black-streaked sky, something 
cloud-like forming above us. Soon, 
but not yet ... 

Brand faded and vanished again. 



Wildly I sought him everywhere. 

Then he faced me. He had come 
over to my side of the pass. He 
stood about ten meters to the south 
of me, with the wind at his back. I 
knew that I could not shift it in 
time. I wondered about throwing 
my rock. He would probably duck 
and I would be throwing away my 
shield. On the other hand .... 

He raised the weapon to his 
shoulder. 

Stall! cried my own voice within 
my mind, while I continued to 
tamper with the heavens. 

“Before you shoot, Brand, tell 
me one thing. All right?” 

He hesitated, then lowered the 
weapon a few inches. 

“What?” 

“Were you telling me the truth 
about what happened — with Dad, 
the Pattern, the coming of Chaos?” 

He threw back his head and 
laughed, a series of short barks. 

“Corwin,” he stated then, “it 
pleases me more than I can say to 
see you die not knowing something 
that means that much to you.” 

He laughed again and began to 
raise the weapon. I had just moved 
to hurl my rock and rush him. But 
neither of us completed either ac- 
tion. 

There came a great shriek from 
overhead, and a piece of the sky 
seemed to detach itself and fall 
upon Brand’s head. He screamed 
and dropped the crossbow. He 
raised his hands to tear at the thing 
that assailed him. The red bird, the 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS 



85 





Jewel-bearer, bom of my blood 
from my father’s hand, had re- 
turned, to defend me. 

I let go the rock and advanced 
upon him, drawing my blade as I 
went. Brand struck the bird and it 
flapped away, gaining altitude, 
circling for another dive. He raised 
both arms to cover his face and 
head, but not before I saw the blood 
that flowed from his left eyesocket. 

He began to fade again even as I 
rushed toward him. But the bird de- 
scended like a bomb and its talons 
struck Brand about the head once 
again. Then the bird, too, began to 
fade. Brand was reaching for his 
ruddy assailant and being slashed by 
it as they both disappeared. 

When I reached the place of the 



action, the only thing that remained 
was the fallen crossbow, and I 
smashed it with my boot. 

Not yet, not yet the end, damn it! 
How long will you plague me, 
brother? How far must I go to bring 
it to an end between us? 

I climbed back down to the trail. 
Star was not yet dead and I had to 
finish the job. Sometimes I think 
I’m in the wrong business. 

VII. 

A BOWL OF COTTON CANDY. 

Having traversed the pass, I re- 
garded the valley that lay before 
me. At least I assumed that it was 
a valley. I could see nothing below 
its cover of cloud/mist/fog. 



86 



GALAXY 




In the sky, one of the red streaks 
was turning yellow; another, green. 

I was slightly heartened by this, as 
i lie sky had behaved in a somewhat 
similar fashion when I had visited 
i he edge of things, across from the 
Courts of Chaos. 

1 hitched up my pack and began 
hiking down the trail. The winds 
diminished as I went. Distantly, I 
heard some thunder from the storm 
I was fleeing. I wondered where 
brand had, gone. I had a feeling that 
I would not be seeing him again for 
a lime. 

Partway down, with the fog just 
beginning to creep and curl about 
me, I spotted an ancient tree and 
cut myself a staff. The tree seemed 
to shriek as I severed its limb. 

“Damn you!” came something 
like a voice from within it. 

“You’re sentient?” I said. “I’m 
sorry . .” 

“I spent a long time growing that 
branch. I suppose you are going to 
bum it now?” 

“No,” I said. “I needed a staff. 
I've a long walk before me.” 

“Through this valley?” 

“That’s right.” 

“Come closer, that I may better 
sense your presence. There is some- 
thing about you that glows.” 

I took a step forward. 

“Oberon!” it said. “I know thy 
lewel.” 

“Not Oberon,” I said. “I am his 
son. I wear it on his mission, 
though.” 

“Then take my limb, and have 



my blessing with it. I’ve sheltered 
your father on many a strange day. 
He planted me, you see.” 

“Really? Planting a tree is one of 
the few things I never saw Dad 
do.” 

“I am no ordinary tree. He 
placed me here to mark a bound- 
ary.” 

“Of what sort?” 

“I am the end of Chaos and of 
Order, depending upon how you 
view me. I mark a division. Beyond 
me other rules apply.” 

“What rules?” 

“Who can say? Not I. I am only 
a growing tower of sentient lumber. 
My staff may comfort you, how- 
ever. Planted, it may blossom in 
strange climes. Then again, it may 
not. Who can say? Bear it with 
you, however, son of Oberon, into 
the place where you journey now. I 
feel a storm approaching. Good- 
bye.” 

“Good-bye,” I said. “Thank 
you.” 

I turned and walked on down the 
trail into the deepening fog. The 
pinkness was drained from it as I 
went. I shook my head as I thought 
about the tree, but its staff proved 
useful for the next several hundred 
meters, where the going was par- 
ticularly rough. 

Then things cleared a bit. Rocks, 
a stagnant pool, some small, dreary 
trees festooned with ropes of moss, 
a smell of decay ... I hurried by. 
A dark bird was watching me from 
one of the trees. 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS

It took wing as I regarded it, 
flapping in a leisurely fashion in my 
direction. Recent events having left 
me a little bird-shy, I drew back as 
it circled my head. But then it flut- 
tered to rest on the trail before me, 
cocked its head and viewed me with 
its left eye. 

“Yes,” it announced then. “You 
are the one.” 

“The one what?” I said. 

“The one I will accompany. 
You’ve no objection to a bird of 
ill-omen following you, have you, 
Corwin?’ ’ 

It chuckled then, and executed a 
little dance. 

“Offhand, I do not see how I can 
stop you. How is it that you know 
my name?” 

“I’ve been waiting for you since 
the beginning of Time, Corwin.” 

“Must have been a bit tire- 
some.” 

“It has not been all that long, in 
this place. Time is what you make 
of it. ’ ’ 

I resumed walking. I passed the 
bird and kept going. Moments later, 
it flashed by me and landed atop a 
rock off to my right. 

“My name is Hugi,” he stated. 
“You are carrying a piece of old 
Ygg, I see.” 

“Ygg?” 

“The stuffy old tree who waits at 
the entrance to this place and won’t 
let anyone rest on his branches. I’ll 
bet he yelled when you whacked it 
off.” He emitted peals of laughter 
then. 

88 



“He was quite decent about it.” 3 
“I’ll bet. But then, he hadn’t 
much choice once you’d done it. 
Fat lot of good it will do you.” 

“It’s doing me fine,” I said, 
swinging it lightly in his direction. 
He fluttered away from it. 

“Hey! That was not funny!” 

I laughed. 

“I thought it was.” 

I walked on by. 

For a long while I made my way 
through a marshy area. As occa- 
sional gust of wind would clear the 
way nearby. Then I would pass it, 
or the fogs would shift over it once 
again. 

Occasionally I seemed to hear a 
snatch of music — from what direc- 
tion, I could not tell — slow, and 
somewhat stately, produced by a 
steel -stringed instrument. 

As I slogged along, I was hailed 
from somewhere to my left: 

“Stranger! Halt and regard me!” 
Wary, I halted. Couldn’t see a 
damned thing through that fog, 
though. 

“Hello,” I said. “Where are 
you?” 

Just then the fogs broke for a 
moment and I beheld a huge head, 
eyes on a level with my own. They 
belonged to what seemed a giant 
body, sunk up to the shoulders in a 
quag. The head was bald, the skin 
pale as milk, with a stony texture to 
it. The dark eyes probably seemed 
even darker than they really were 
by way of contrast. 

“I see,” I said then. “You are in 

GALAXY 




a bit of a fix. Can you free your 
arms?” 

“If I strain mightily,” came the 
reply. 

“Well, let me check about for 
something stable you can grab onto. 
You ought to have a pretty good 
reach there.” 

“No. That is not necessary.” 

“Don’t you want to get out? I 
thought that was why you hol- 
lered.” 

“Oh, no. I simply wanted you to 
regard me.” 

I moved nearer and started, for 
(he fog was beginning to shift 
again. 

“All right,” I said. “I have seen 
you.” 

“Do you feel my plight?” 

“Not particularly, if you will not 
help yourself or accept help.” 

“What good would it do me to 
free myself?” 

“Your question. You answer it.” 

I turned to go. 

“Wait! Where do you travel?” 

“South, to appear in a morality 
play.” 

Just then Hugi flew out of the 
log and landed atop the head. He 
pecked at it and laughed. 

“Don’t waste your time, Corwin. 
There is much less here than meets 
ihe eye,” he said. 

The giant lips shaped my name. 
Then, “He is indeed the one?” 

“That’s him, all right,” Hugi re- 
plied. 

“Listen, Corwin,” said the sunk- 
en giant. “You are going to try to 



stop the Chaos, aren’t you?” 

“Yes.” 

“Do not do it. It is not worth it. 
I want things to end. I desire a re- 
lease from this condition.” 

“I already offered to help you 
out. You turned me down.” 

“Not that sort of release. An end 
to the whole works.” 

“That is easily done,” I said. 
“Just duck your head and take a 
deep breath.” 

“It is not only personal termina- 
tion that I desire, but an end to the 
whole foolish game.” 

“I believe there are a few other 
folks around who would rather 
make their own decisions on the 
matter.” 

“Let it end for them, too. There 
will come a time when they are in 
my position and will feel the same 
way. ’ ’ 

“Then they will possess the same 
option. Good day.” 

I turned and walked on. 

“You will, too!” he called after 
me. 

As I hiked along, Hugi caught up 
with me and perched on the end of 
my staff. 

“It’s neat to sit on old Ygg’s 
limb now he can’t — Yikes!” 

Hugi sprang into the air and cir- 
cled. 

“Burned my foot! How’d he do 
that?” he cried. 

I laughed. 

“Beats me.” 

He fluttered for a few moments, 
then made for my right shoulder.

“Okay if I rest here?” 

“Go ahead.” 

“Thanks.” He settled. “The 
Head is really a mental basket case, 
you know.” 

I shrugged my shoulders and he 
spread his wings for balance. 

“He is groping after something,” 
he went on, “but proceeding incor- 
rectly by holding the world respon- 
sible for his own failings.” 

“No. He would not even grope 
to get out of the mud,” I said. 

“I meant philosophically.” 

“Oh, that sort of mud. Too 
bad.” 

“The whole problem lies with the 
self, the ego, and its involvement 
with the world on the one hand and 
the Absolute on the other.” 

“Oh, is that so?” 

“Yes. You see, we are hatched 
and we drift on the surface of 
events. Sometimes we feel that we 
actually influence things, and this 
gives rise to striving. This is a big 
mistake, because it creates desires 
and builds up a false ego when just 
being should be enough. That leads 
to more desires and more striving 
and there you are, trapped.” 

“In the mud?” 

“So to speak. One needs to fix 
one’s vision firmly on the Absolute 
and leam to ignore the mirages, the 
illusions, the fake sense of identity 
that sets one apart as a false is- 
land of consciousness.” 

“I had a fake identity once. It 
helped me a lot in becoming the ab- 
solute that I am now: me.” 



“No, that’s fake, too.” 

“Then the me that may exist to- 
morrow will thank me for it, as I do 
that other.” 

“You are missing the point. That 
you will be fake, too.” 

“Why?” 

“Because it will still be full of 
those desires and strivings that set 
you apart from the Absolute.” 
“What is wrong with that?” 

“You remain alone in a world of 
strangers, the world of phenomena.” 
“I like being alone. I am quite 
fond of myself. I like phenomena, 
too.” 

“Yet the Absolute will always be 
there, calling to you, causing un- 
rest.” 

“Good, then there is no need to 
hurry. But yes, I see what you 
mean. It takes the form of ideals. 
Everyone has a few. If you are say- 
ing that I should pursue them, I 
agree with you.” 

“No, they are distortions of the 
Absolute, and what you are talking 
about is more striving.” 

“That is correct,” 

“I can see that you have a lot to 
unlearn.” 

“If you are talking about my 
vulgar instinct for survival, forget 
it.” 

The trail had been leading up- 
ward, and we came now to a 
smooth, level place, almost paved- 
seeming, though strewn lightly with 
sand. The music had grown louder 
and continued to do so as I ad- 
vanced. Then, through the fog, I 



90 



GALAXY 




saw dim shapes moving, slowly, 
rhythmically. It took several mo- 
ments for me to realize that they 
were dancing to the music. 

I kept moving until I could view 
ihe figures — human-seeming, hand- 
some folk, garbed in courtly 
attire — treading to the slow mea- 
sures of invisible musicians. It was 
an intricate and lovely dance that 
they executed, and I halted to watch 
some of it. 

“What is the occasion,” I asked 
Hugi, “for a party out here in the 
middle of nowhere?” 

“They dance,” he said, “to 
celebrate your passage. They are 
not mortals, but the spirits of Time. 
They began this foolish show when 
you entered the valley.” 

“Spirits?” 

“Yes. Observe.” 

He left my shoulder, flew above 
them and defecated. The dropping 
passed through several dancers as if 
they were holograms, without stain- 
ing a brocaded sleeve or a silken 
shirt, without causing any of the 
smiling figures to miss a measure. 
Hugi cawed several times then and 
Hew back to me. 

“That was hardly necessary,” I 
said. “It is a fine performance.” 
“Decadent,” he said, “and you 
should hardly take it as a compli- 
ment, for they anticipate your fail- 
ure. They but wish to get in a final 
celebration before the show is 
closed.” 

I watched for a time anyway, 
leaning upon my staff, resting. The 



figure described by the dancers 
slowly shifted, until one of the 
women — an aubum-haired beauty 
— was quite near to me. Now, none 
of the dancers’ eyes at any time met 
my own. It was as if I were not 
present. But that woman, in a per- 
fectly timed gesture, cast with her 
right hand something that landed at 
my feet. 

I stooped and found it substantial. 
It was a silver rose — my own 
emblem — that I held. I straightened 
and fixed it at the collar of my 
cloak. Hugi looked the other way 
and said nothing. I had no hat to 
doff, but I did bow to the lady. 
There might have been a slight 
twitch of one eye as I turned to go. 

The ground lost its smoothness as 
I walked, and finally the music 
faded. The trail grew rougher, and 
whenever the fogs cleared, the only 
views were of rocks or barren 
plains. I drew strength from the 
Jewel when I would otherwise have 
collapsed, and I noted that each 
such fix was of shorter duration 
now. 

After a time I grew hungry and I 
halted to eat what rations I had left. 

Hugi stood on the ground nearby 
and watched me eat. 

“I will admit to a certain small 
admiration for your persistence,” he 
said, “and even for what you im- 
plied when you spoke of ideals. But 
that is about it. Earlier we were 
talking about the futility of desire 
and of striving — ” 

“You were. It is not a major 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS 



91 




concern in my life.” 

“It should be.” 

“I have had a long life, Hugi. 
You insult me by assuming I have 
never considered these footnotes to 
Sophomore philosophy. The fact 
that you find concensus reality bar- 
ren tells me more about you than it 
does about that state of affairs. To 
wit, if you believe what you say, I 
feel sorry for you, in that you must 
for some inexplicable reason be 
here, desiring and striving to influ- 
ence this false ego of mine, rather 
than free of such nonsense and on 
your way to your Absolute. If you 
do not believe it, then it tells me 
that you have been set to hinder and 
discourage me, in which case you 
are wasting your time.” 

Hugi made a gargling noise. 
Then, “You are not so blind that 
you deny the Absolute, the begin- 
ning and end of everything?” 

“It is not indispensable to a lib- 
eral education.” 

“You admit the possibility?” 
“Perhaps I know it better than 
you, bird. The ego, as I see it, ex- 
ists at an intermediate stage between 
rationality and reflex existence. 
Blotting is out is a retreat, though. 
If you come from that Absolute — of 
a self-canceling All — why do you 
wish to go back home? Do you so 
despise yourself that you fear mir- 
rors? Why not make the trip worth- 
while? Develop. Learn. Live. If you 
have been sent on a journey, why do 
you wish to cop out and run back to 
your point of departure? Or did 



your Absolute make a mistake in 
sending something of your caliber? 
Admit that possibility and that is the 
end of the news.” 

Hugi glared at me, then sprang 
into the air and flew off. Going to 
consult his manual, perhaps .... 

I heard a peal of thunder as I rose 
to my feet. I began walking. I had 
to try to keep ahead of things. 

The trail narrowed and widened a 
number of times before it vanished 
completely, leaving me to wander 
across a gravelly plain. I felt more 
and more depressed as I traveled, 
trying to keep my mental compass 
set in the proper direction. I almost 
came to welcome the sounds of the 
storm, for they at least gave me a 
rough idea as to which way was 
north. Of course things were a bit 
confusing in the fog, so that I could 
not be absolutely certain. And they 
were growing louder .... Damn. 

. And I had been grieved by 
the loss of Star, troubled by Hugi’s 
futilitarianism. This was definitely 
not a good day. I began to doubt 
that I was going to complete my 
journey. If some nameless denizen 
of this dark place did not ambush 
me before too long, there was a 
strong possibility that 1 would wan- 
der here until my strength failed or 
the storm caught me. I did not 
know whether I would be able to 
beat back that canceling storm 
another time. I began to doubt it. 

I tried using the Jewel to disperse 
the fog, but its effects seemed 
blunted. By my own sluggishness, 



92 



GALAXY 




perhaps. I could clear a small area, 
but my rate of travel quickly bore 
me through it. My sense of Shadow 
was dulled in this place which 
seemed in some way the essence of 
Shadow. 

Sad. It would have been nice to 
go out with opera — in a big Wagne- 
rian finale beneath strange skies, 
against worthy opponents — not 

scrabbling about in a foggy waste- 
land. 

I passed a familiar-seeming out- 
crop of stone. Could I have been 
moving in a circle? There is a ten- 
dency to do that when completely 
lost. I listened for the thunder, to 
take my bearings again. Perversely, 
all was silent. I moved to the out- 
crop and seated myself on the 
ground, resting my back against it. 
No sense to merely wandering. I 
would wait a time for the thunder’s 
signal. I withdrew my Trumps as I 
sat 'there. Dad had said that they 
would be out of commission for a 
time, but I had nothing better to do. 

One by one, I went through them 
all, trying to reach everyone, save 
for Brand and Caine. Nothing. Dad 
had been right. The cards lacked the 
familiar coldness. I shuffled the en- 
tire deck then and cast my fortune, 
there on the sand. I got an impossi- 
ble reading and put them all away 
again. I leaned back and wished I 
had some water left. For a long 
while, I listened for the storm. 
There were a few growls, but they 
were directionless. The Trumps 
made me think of my family. They 



were up ahead — wherever that 
might be — waiting for me. Waiting 
for what? I was transporting the 
Jewel. To what end? At first I had 
assumed that its powers might be 
necessary in the conflict. If so, and 
if 1 were indeed the only one who 
could employ them, then we were 
in bad shape. I thought of Amber 
then,- and I was shaken with re- 
morse and a kind of dread. Things 
must not end for Amber, ever. 
There had to be a way to roll back 
the Chaos .... 

I threw away a small stone I had 
been toying with. Once I released 
it, it moved very slowly. 

The Jewel. Its slowdown effect 
again .... 

I drew more energy and the stone 
shot away. It seemed that I had just 
taken strength from the Jewel a lit- 
tle while ago. While this treatment 
energized my body, my mind still 
felt fogged up. I needed sleep — 
with lots of rapid eye movements. 
This place might seem a lot less 
unusual if I were rested. 

How close was I to my destina- 
tion? Was it just beyond the next 
mountain range, or an enormous 
distance farther? And what chance 
had I of staying ahead of that 
storm, no matter what the distance? 
And the others? Supposing the bat- 
tle was already concluded and we 
had lost? I had visions of arriving 
too late, to serve only as gravedig- 
ger ... Bones and soliloquies, 
Chaos .... 

And where was that damned 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS 



93 




black road now that I finally had a 
use for it? If I could locate it, I 
could follow it. I had a feeling that 
it was somewhere off to my 
left ... 

I reached out once again, parting 
the fogs, rolling them back . noth- 
ing ... 

A shape? Something moving? 

It was an animal, a large dog 
perhaps, moving to remain within 
the fog. Was it stalking me? 

The Jewel began to pulse as I 
moved the fog even farther back. 
Exposed, the animal seemed to 
shrug itself. Then it moved straight 
toward me. 

VIII. 

I stood as it came near. I could 
see then that it was a jackal, a big 
one, its eyes fixed on my own. 

“You are a little early,” I said. 
“I was only resting.” 

It chuckled. 

“I have come merely to regard a 
Prince of Amber,” the beast said. 
“Anything else would be a bonus.” 

It chuckled again. So did I. 

“Then feast your eyes. Anything 
else, and you will find that I have 
rested sufficiently.” 

“Nay, nay,” said the jackal. “1 
am a fan of the House of Amber. 
And that of Chaos. Royal blood ap- 
peals to me. Prince of Chaos. And 
conflict.” 

“You have awarded me an un- 
familiar title. My connection with 
the Courts of Chaos is mainly a 



matter of genealogy.” 

“I think of the images of Amber 
passing through the shadows of 
Chaos. I think of the waves of 
Chaos washing over the images of 
Amber. Yet at the heart of the order 
Amber represents moves a family 
most chaotic, just as the House of 
Chaos is serene and placid. Yet you 
have your ties, as well as your con- 
flicts.” 

“At the moment,” I said, “I am 
not interested in paradox-hunting 
and terminology games. I am trying 
to get to the Courts of Chaos. Do 
you know the way?” 

“Yes,” said the jackal. “It is not 
far, as the carrion-bird flies. Come, 
I will set you in the proper direc- 
tion.” 

It turned and began walking 
away. I followed. 

“Do I move too fast? You seem 
tired.” 

“No. Keep going. It is beyond 
this valley certainly, is it not?” 

“Yes. There is a tunnel.” 

I followed it, out across sand and 
gravel and dry, hard ground. There 
was nothing growing at either hand. 
As we walked, the fogs thinned and 
took on a greenish cast — another 
trick of that stippled sky, I as- 
sumed. 

After a time, I called out, “How 
much farther is it?” 

“Not too far now,” it said. “Do 
you grow tired? Do you wish to 
rest?” 

It looked back as it spoke. The 
greenish light gave to its ugly fea- 



94 



GALAXY 




tures an even more ghastly cast. 
Still, I needed a guide; and we were 
heading uphill, which seemed to be 
proper. 

“Is there water anywhere near 
about?” I asked. 

“No. We would have to 
backtrack a considerable distance.” 
“Forget it. I haven’t the time.” 

It shrugged and chuckled and 
continued on. The fog cleared a lit- 
tle more as we went, and I could 
see that we were entering a low 
range of hills. I leaned on my staff 
and kept up the pace. We climbed 
steadily for perhaps half an hour, 
the ground growing stonier, the 
angle of ascent steeper. I found my- 
self beginning to breathe heavily. 

“Wait,” I called to him. “I do 
want to rest now. I thought you said 
that it was not far.” 

“Forgive me,” it said, halting, 
“for jackalocentrism. I was judging 
in terms of my own natural pace. I 
erred in this, but we are almost 
there now. It lies among the rocks 
just ahead. Why not rest there?” 
“All right,” I replied, and I re- 
sumed walking. 

Soon we reached a stony wall 
which I realized was the foot of a 
mountain. We picked our way 
among the rocky debris that lined 
it and came at last to an opening 
which led back into darkness. 

“There you have it,” said the 
jackal. “The way is straight, and 
there are no troublesome side 
branches. Take your passage 
through, and good speed to you.”

“Thank you,” I said, giving up 
thoughts of rest for the moment and 
stepping inside. “I appreciate this.” 

“My pleasure,” he said from be- 
hind me. 

I took several more steps and 
something crunched beneath my feet 
and rattled when kicked aside. It 
was a sound one does not readily 
forget. The floor was strewn with 
bones. 

There came a soft, - quick sound 
from behind me, and I knew that I 
did not have time to draw Grays- 
wandir. So I spun, raising my staff 
before me and thrusting with it. 

This maneuver blocked the 
beast’s leap, striking it on the 
shoulder. But it also knocked me 
over backward, to roll among the 
bones. The staff was tom from my 
hands by the impact, and in the 
split-second of decision allowed me 
by my opponent’s own fall, I chose 
to draw Grayswandir rather than 
grope after it. 

I managed to get my blade un- 
sheathed, but that was all. I was 
still' on my back with the point of 
my weapon to my left when the 
jackal recovered and leaped again. I 
swung the pommel with all of my 
strength into its face. 

The shock ran down my arm and 
up into my shoulder. The jackal’s 
head snapped back and its body 
twisted to my left. I brought the 
point into line immediately, grip- 
ping the hilt with both hands, and I 
was able to rise to my right knee 
before it snarled and lunged again. 



As soon as I saw that I had it on 
target, I threw my weight behind it 
as we met, driving the blade deep 
into the jackal’s body. I released it 
quickly and rolled away from those 
snapping jaws. 

The jackal shrieked, struggled to 
rise, dropped back. I lay panting 
where I had fallen. I felt the staff 
beneath me and seized it. I brought 
it around to guard and drew myself 
back against the cave Wall. The 
beast did not rise again, however, 
but lay there thrashing. In the dim 
light I could see that it was vomit- 
ing. The smell was overpowering. 

Then it turned its eyes in my di- 
rection and lay still. 

“It would have been so fine,” it 
said softly, “to eat a Prince of 
Amber. I always wondered about 
royal blood . .” 

Then the eyes closed and the breath- 
ing stopped and I was left with 
the stink. 

I rose, back still against the wall, 
staff still before me, and regarded 
it. It was a long while before I 
could bring myself to retrieve my 
blade. 

A quick exploration showed me 
that I was in no tunnel, but only a 
cave. When I made my way out, 
the fog had grown yellow, and it 
was stirred now by a breeze from 
the lower reaches of the valley. 

I leaned against the rock and tried 
to decide which way to take. There 
was no real trail here. 

Finally, I struck off to my left. 
That way seemed somewhat steeper, 



96 



GALAXY 




and I wanted to get above the fog 
and into the mountains as soon as I 
could. The staff continued to serve 
me well. I kept listening for the 
sound of running water, but there 
was none about. 

I struggled along, always continu- 
ing upward, and the fogs thinned 
and changed color. Finally, I could 
see that I was climbing toward a 
wide plateau. Above it, I began to 
catch glimpses of the sky, many- 
colored and churning. 

There were several sharp claps of 
thunder at my back, but I still could 
not see the disposition of the storm. 
I increased my pace then, but began 
to grow dizzy after a few minutes. 1 
stopped and seated myself on the 
ground, panting. I was over- 
whelmed with a sense of failure. 
Even if I made it up to the plateau, 
1 had a feeling that the storm would 
roar right across it. I rubbed my 
eyes with the heels of my hands. 
What was the use of going on if 
there was no way I could make it? 

A shadow moved through the pis- 
tachio mists, dropped toward me. I 
raised my staff, then saw that it was 
only Hugi. He braked himself and 
landed at my feet. 

“Corwin,” he said, “you have 
come a good distance.” 

“But maybe not good enough,” I 
said. “The storm seems to be get- 
ting nearer.” 

“I believe that it is. I have been 
meditating and would like to give 
you the benefit of — ” 

“If you want to benefit me at 



all,” I said, “I could tell you what 
to do.” 

“What is that?” 

“Fly back and see how far off 
the storm really is, and how fast it 
seems to be moving. Then come 
and tell me.” 

Hugi hopped from one foot to the 
other. Then, “All right,” he said, 
and leaped into the air and batted 
his way toward what I felt to be the 
northwest. 

I leaned on the staff and rose. I 
might as well keep climbing at the 
best pace I could manage. I drew 
upon the Jewel again, and strength 
came into me like a red lightning 
flash. 

As I mounted the slope, a damp 
breeze sprang up from the direction 
in which Hugi had departed. There 
came another thunderclap. No more 
growls and rumbles. 

I made the most of the influx of 
energy, climbing quickly and effi- 
ciently for several hundred meters. 
If I were going to lose, I might as 
well make it to the top first. I might 
as well see where I was and learn 
whether there was anything at all 
left for me to try. 

My view of the sky grew more 
and more clear as I climbed. It had 
changed considerably since last I 
had regarded it. Half of it was of 
uninterrupted blackness and the 
other half those masses of swim- 
ming colors. And the entire 
heavenly bowl seemed to be rota- 
ting about a point directly overhead. 
I began to grow excited. This was 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS

the sky I was seeking, the sky 
that had covered me that time I 
had journeyed to Chaos. I struggled 
higher. I wanted to utter something 
heartening, but my throat was too 
dry. 

As I neared the rim of the 
plateau, 1 heard a flapping sound 
and Hugi was suddenly on my 
shoulder. 

“The storm is about ready to 
crawl up your arse,” he said. “Be 
here any minute.” 

I continued climbing, reached 
level ground and hauled myself up 
to it. I stood for a moment then, 
breathing heavily. The wind must 
have kept the area clear of fog, for 
it was a high, smooth plain, and I 
could see the sky for a great dis- 
tance ahead. I advanced, to find a 
point from which I could see be- 
yond the farther edge. As I moved, 
the sounds of the storm came to me 
more clearly. 

“I do not believe you will make 
it across,” Hugi said, “without get- 
ting wet.” 

“You know that is no ordinary 
storm,” I croaked. “If it were, I’d 
be thankful for the chance of getting 
a drink.” 

“I know. I was speaking figura- 
tively.” 

I growled something vulgar and 
kept going. 

Gradually the vista before me 
enlarged. The sky still did its crazy 
veil dance, but the illumination was 
more than sufficient. When I 
reached a position where I was posi- 

98 



tive what lay before me, I halted 
and sagged against my staff. 

“What is the matter?” Hugi 
asked. 

But I could not speak. I simply 
gestured at the great wasteland 
which commenced somewhere 
below the farther lip of the plateau 
to sweep on for at least forty miles 
before butting up against another 
range of mountains. And far off to 
the left and still running strong went 
the black road. 

“The waste?” he said. “I could 
have told you it was there. Why ' 
didn’t you ask me?” 

I made a noise halfway between a 
groan and a sob and sank slowly to 
the ground. 

How long I remained so, I am 
not certain. I felt more than a little 
delirious. In the midst of it I 
seemed to see a possible answer, 
though something within me rebel- 
led against it. I was finally roused 
by the noises of the storm and 
Hugi’s chattering. 

“I can’t beat it across that 
place,” I whispered. “There is no 
way.” 

“You say you have failed,” Hugi 
said. “But this is not so. There is 
neither failure nor victory in striv- 
ing. It is all but an illusion of the 
ego.” 

I rose slowly to my knees. 

“I did not say that I had failed.” 

“You said that you cannot go on 
to your destination. ’ ’ 

I looked back, to where light- 
nings now flashed as the storm 

GALAXY 




climbed toward me. 

“That’s right, I cannot do it that 
way. But if Dad failed, I have got 
to attempt something that Brand 
tried to convince me only he could 
do. I have to create a new Pattern, 
and I have to do it right here.” 
“You? Create a new Pattern? If 
Oberon failed, how could a man 
who can barely stay on his feet do 
it? No, Corwin. Resignation is the 
greatest virtue you might cultivate.” 
I raised my head and lowered the 
staff to the ground. Hugi fluttered 
down to stand beside it and I re- 
garded him. 

“You do not want to believe any 
of the things that I said, do you?” I 
told him. “It does not matter, 
though. The conflict between our 
views is irreducible. I see desire as 
hidden identity and striving as its 
growth. You do not.” I moved my 
hands forward and rested them on 
my knees. “If for you the greatest 
good is union with the Absolute, 
then why do you not fly to join it 
now, in the form of the all- 
pervading Chaos which approaches? 
If I fail here, it will become Abso- 
lute. As for me, I must try, for so 
long as there is breath within me, to 
raise up a Pattern against it, I do 
this because I am what I am, and I 
am the man who could have been 
king in Amber.” 

Hugi lowered his head. 

“I’ll see you eat crow first,” he 
said, and he chuckled. 

I reached out quickly and twisted 
his head off, wishing that I had 



time to build a fire. Though he 
made it look like a sacrifice, it is 
difficult to say to whom the moral 
victory belonged, since I was plan- 
ning on doing it anyway. 

IX. 

. Cassis, and the 

smell of the chestnut blossoms. All 
along the Champs-Elysees the 
chestnuts were foaming white .... 

I remembered the play of the 
fountains in the Place de la Con- 
corde .... And down the Rue de 
Seine and along the quais, the smell 
of the old books, the smell of the 
river ... the smell of chestnut 
blossoms .... 

Why should I suddenly remember 
1905 and Paris on the shadow 
Earth, save that I was very happy 
that year and I might, reflexively, 
have sought an antidote for the 
present? Yes . 

White absinthe, Amer Picon, 
grenadine . wild strawberries, 
with Creme d’lsigny . chess at 
the Cafe de la Regence with actors 
from the Comedie Francaise, just 
across the way ... the races at 
Chantilly . evenings at the Boite 
a Fursy on the Rue Pigalle .... 

I placed my left foot firmly be- 
fore my right, my right before my 
left. In my left hand I held the 
chain from which the Jewel 
depended — and I carried it high, so 
that I could stare into the stone’s 
depths, seeing and feeling there the 
emergence of the new Pattern that

I described with each step. I had 
screwed my staff into the ground 
and left it to stand near the Pattern’s 
beginning. Left .... 

The wind sang about me and 
there was thunder near at hand. I 
did not meet with the physical re- 
sistance that I did on the old Pattern. 
There was no resistance at all. 
Instead — and in many ways 
worse — a peculiar deliberation had 
come over all my movements, slow- 
ing them, ritualizing them. I seemed 
to expend more energy in preparing 
for each step — perceiving it, realiz- 
ing it and ordering my mind for its 
execution — than I did in the physi- 
cal performance of the act. Yet the 
slowness seemed to require itself, 
was exacted of me by some un- 
known agency which determined 
precision and an adagio tempo for 
all my movements. Right .... 

. And, as the Pattern in 
Rebma had helped to restore my 
faded memories, so this one I was 
now striving to create stirred and 
elicited the smell of the chestnut 
trees, of the wagonloads of vegeta- 
bles moving through the dawn to- 
ward the Halles ... I was not in 
love with anyone in particular at 
the time, though there were many 
girls — Yvettes and Mimis and 
Simones, their faces merge — and it 
was spring in Paris, with Gipsy 
bands and cocktails at Louis’s ... I 
remembered, and my heart leaped 
with a kind of Proustian joy while 
Time tolled about me like a 
bell .... And perhaps this was the 



reason for the recollection, for this 
joy seemed transmitted to my 
movements, informed my percep- 
tions, empowered my will .... 

I saw the next step and I took 
it ... I had been around once now, 
creating the perimeter of my Pat- 
tern. At my back, I could feel the 
storm. It must have mounted to the 
plateau’s rim. The sky was darken- 
ing, the storm blotting the swing- 
ing, swimming, colored lights. 
Flashes of lightning splayed about, 
and I could not spare the energy 
and the attention to try to control 
things. 

Having gone completely around, 
I could see that as much of the new 
Pattern as I had walked was now 
inscribed in the rock and glowing 
palely, bluely. Yet there were no 
sparks, no tingles in my feet, no 
hair-raising currents — only the 

steady law of deliberation, upon me 
like a great weight . left .... 

. Poppies, poppies and 
cornflowers and tall poplars 
along country roads, the taste of Nor- 
mandy cider . and in town 
again, the smell of the chestnut 
blossoms ... the Seine full of 
stars ... the smell of the old brick 
houses in the Place de Vosges after 
a morning’s rain ... the bar under 
the Olympia Music Hall ... a 
fight there . bloodied knuckles, 
bandaged by a girl who took me 
home . what was her name? 
Chestnut blossoms ... a white 
rose .... 

I sniffed then. The odor was all but

gone from the remains of the rose at 
my collar. Surprising that any of it 
had survived this far. It heartened 
me. 1 pushed ahead, curving gently 
lo my right. From the corner of my 
eye, I saw the advancing wall of the 
storm, slick as glass, obliterating 
everything it passed. The roar of its 
thunder was deafening now. 

Right, left . 

The advance of the armies of the 
night . would my Pattern hold 
against it? I wished that I might 
hurry, but if anything, I was moving 
with increasing slowness as I went 
on. I felt a curious sense of biloca- 
lion, almost as if I were within the 
Jewel tracing the Pattern there my- 
self while I moved out here, regard- 
ing it and mimicking its progress. 
Left . tum . right .... The 
storm was indeed advancing. Soon 
it would reach old Hugi’s bones. I 
smelled the moisture and the ozone 
and wondered about the strange 
dark bird who had said he’d been 
waiting for me since the beginning 
of Time. Waiting to argue with me 
or to be eaten by me in this place 
without history? Whatever, consid- 
ering the exaggeration usual in 
moralists, it was fitting that, having 
failed to leave me with my heart all 
laden with rue over my spiritual 
condition, he be consumed to the 
accompaniment of theatrical thun- 
der .... There was distant thunder, 
near thunder and more thunder now. 
As I turned in that direction once 
more, the lightning flashes were 
nearly blinding. I clutched my chain 



and took another step .... 

The storm pushed right up to the 
edge of my Pattern, and then it 
parted. It began to creep around 
me. Not a drop fell upon me or the 
Pattern. But slowly, gradually, we 
came to be totally engulfed within 
it. 

It seemed as if I were in a bubble 
at the bottom of a stormy sea. 
Walls of water encircled me and 
dark shapes darted by. It seemed as 
if the entire universe were pressing 
in to crush me. I concentrated on 
the red world of the Jewel. 
Left ... 

The chestnut blossoms ... a 
cup of hot chocolate at a sidewalk 
cafe ... a band concert in the 
Tuileries Gardens, the sounds 
climbing through the sunbright 
air . Berlin in the twenties, the 
Pacific in the thirties — there had 
been pleasures there, but of a dif- 
ferent order. It may not be the true 
past, but images of the past that 
rush to comfort or torment us later, 
man or nation. No matter. Across 
the Pont Neuf and down the Rue 
Rivoli, buses and fiacres . pain- 
ters at their easels in the Luxem- 
bourg Gardens .... If all were to 
fall well, I might seek a shadow 
like this again one day ... it 
ranked with my Avalon. I had 
forgotten ... the details ... the 
touches that make for life ... the 
smell of the chestnuts .... 

Walking ... I completed another 
circuit. The wind screamed and the 
storm roared on, but I was un-

touched. So long as I did not permit 
it to distract me, so long as I kept 
moving and maintained my focus on 
the Jewel ... 1 had to hold up, had 
to keep taking these slow, careful 
steps, never to stop, slower and 
slower but constantly moving 
.... Faces ... it seemed that rows 
of faces regarded me from be- 
yond the Pattern’s edge . large, 
like the Head, but twisted — 
grinning, jeering, mocking me, 
waiting for me to stop or step 
wrongly . waiting for the whole 
thing to come apart around me 
. there was lightning behind 
their eyes and in their mouths, 
their laughter was the thun- 
der . shadows crawled among 
them . now they spoke to me, 
with words like a gale from off a 
dark ocean ... I would fail, they 
told me, fail and be swept away, 
this fragment of a Pattern dashed to 
pieces behind me and consumed 
.... They cursed me, they spat 
and vomited toward me, though 
none of it reached . perhaps they 
were not really there . perhaps 
my mind had been broken by the 
strain . then what good were my 
efforts? A new Pattern to be shaped 
by a madman? I wavered, and they 
took up the chorus, “Mad! Mad! 
Mad!” in the voices of the ele- 
ments. 

I drew a deep breath and smelled 
what was left of the rose and 
thought of chestnuts once again, 
and days filled with the joys of life 
and organic order. The voices 



seemed to soften as my mind raced 
back through the events of that 
happy year . and I took another 
step . and another . They had 
been playing on my weaknesses, 
they could feel my doubts, my 
anxiety, my fatigue .... Whatever 
they were, they seized what they 
saw and tried to use it against 
me ... Left . right .... Now 
let them feel my confidence and 
wither, I told myself. I have come 
this far. I will continue. Left .... 

They swirled and swelled about 
me, still mouthing discouragements. 
But some of the force seemed gone 
out of them. I made my way 
through another section of arc, 
seeing it grow before me in my 
mind’s red eye. 

I thought back to my escape from 
Greenwood, to my tricking Flora 
out of information, to my encounter 
with Random, our fight with his 
pursuers, our journey back to 
Amber ... I thought of our flight 
to Rebma and my walking of the 
reversed Pattern there for a restora- 
tion of much of my memo- 
ry ... of Random’s shotgun wed- 
ding and my sojourn to Amber, 
where I fought with Eric and fled to 
Bleys ... of the battles that fol- 
lowed, my blinding, my recovery, 
my escape, my journey to Lorraine 
and then to Avalon. 

Moving into even higher gear, 
my mind skimmed the surface of 
subsequent events . Ganelon and 
Lorraine ... the creatures of the 
Black Circle . Benedict’s arm 



102 



GALAXY 




. Dara ... the return of Brand 
and his stabbing . my stabbing 
. Bill Roth . hospital records 
... my accident .... 

. Now, from the very begin- 
ning at Greenwood, through it all, 
to this moment of my struggle to 
assure each perfect maneuver as it 
appeared to me, I felt the growing 
sense of anticipation I had 
known — whether my actions were 
directed toward the throne, ven- 
geance, or my conception of 
duty — felt it, was aware of its con- 
tinuous existence across those years 
up until this moment, when it was 
finally accompanied by something 
else ... I felt that the waiting was 
just about over, that whatever I had 
been anticipating and struggling to- 



ward was soon to occur. 

Left . very, very slowly . 
nothing else was important. I threw 
all of my will into the movements 
now. My concentration became to- 
tal. Whatever lay beyond the Pat- 
tern, I was now oblivious to it. 
Lightnings, faces, winds ... it did 
not matter. There was only the 
Jewel, the growing Pattern and 
myself — and I was barely aware of 
myself. Perhaps this was the closest 
I would ever come to Hugi’s ideal 
of merging with the Absolute. 
Turn . right foot . turn again. 

Time ceased to have meaning. 
Space was restricted to the design I 
was creating. I drew strength from 
the Jewel without summoning it 
now, as part of the process in which 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS 



103 



I was engaged. In a sense, I sup- 
pose, I was obliterated. I became a 
moving point, programmed by the 
Jewel, performing an operation 
which absorbed me so totally that I 
had no attention available for self- 
consciousness. Yet, at some level, I 
realized that I was a part of the pro- 
cess, also. For I knew, somehow, 
that were anyone else doing it, it 
would be a different Pattern emerg- 
ing. 

I was vaguely aware that I had 
passed the halfway point. The way 
had become trickier, my movements 
even slower. Despite the matter of 
velocity, I was somehow reminded 
of my experiences on originally be- 
coming attuned to the Jewel, in that 
strange, many-dimensional matrix 
that seemed to be the source of 
the Pattern itself. 

Right . left .... 

There was no drag. I felt very 
light, despite the deliberation. A 
boundless energy seemed to wash 
constantly through me. All of the 
sounds about me had merged into a 
white noise and vanished. 

Suddenly then, I no longer 
seemed to be moving slowly. It did 
not seem as if I had passed a Veil 
or barrier, but rather that I had 
undergone internal adjustment. 

It felt as if I were moving at a 
more normal pace now, winding my 
way through tighter and tighter 
coils, approaching what would soon 
be the design’s terminus. Mainly, I 
was still emotionless, though I 
knew intellectually that at some 

104 



level a sense of elation was growing 
and would soon burst through. 
Another step . another . per- 
haps half a dozen more paces. 

Suddenly the world went dark. It 
seemed that I stood within a great 
void, with only the faint light of the 
Jewel before me and the glow of 
the Pattern like a spiral nebula 
through which I was striding. I wa- 
vered, but only for an instant. This 
must be the last trial, the final as- 
sault. I would have to be sufficient 
to the distraction. 

The Jewel showed me what to do 
and the Pattern showed me where to 
do it. The only thing missing was a 
view of myself. Left .... 

I continued, executing each move 
with all of my attention. An oppos- 
ing force began to rise against me 
finally, as on the old Pattern. But 
for this I was prepared by years of 
experience. I struggled for two 
more steps against the mounting 
barrier. 

Then, within the Jewel, I saw the 
ending of the Pattern. I would have 
gasped at the sudden realization of 
its beauty, but at this point even my 
breath was regulated by my efforts. 
I threw all of my strength into the 
next step, and the void seemed to 
shake about me. I completed it, and 
the next was even more difficult. I 
felt as if I were at the center of the 
universe, treading on stars, strug- 
gling to impart some essential motion 
by what was basically an act of 
will. 

My foot slowly advanced, though 
GALAXY 




I could not see it. The Pattern 
began to brighten. Soon its blaze 
was almost blinding. 

Just a little farther ... I strove 
harder than I ever had on the old 
Pattern, for now the resistance 
seemed absolute. I had to oppose it 
with a firmness and constancy of 
will that excluded everything else, 
though I seemed not to be moving 
at all now, though all of my ener- 
gies seemed diverted into the 
brightening of the design. At least 
I would go out with a splendid 
backdrop .... 

Minutes, days, years ... I do 
not know how long this went on. It 
felt like forever, as if I had been 
engaged in this single act for all of 
eternity .... 

Then I moved, and how long that 
took I do not know. But I com- 
pleted the step and began another. 
Then another .... 

The universe seemed to reel 
about me. I was through. 

The pressure was gone. The 
blackness was gone .... 

For an instant I stood at the 
center of my Pattern. Without even 
regarding it, I fell forward onto my 
knees and bent double, my blood 
pounding in my ears. Head swim- 
ming, I panted. I began to shake, 
all over. I had done it, I realized 
dimly. Come whatever may, there 
was a Pattern. And it would en- 
dure. 

I heard a sound where there 
should have been none, but my 
jaded muscles refused to respond. 



even reflexively, until it was too 
late. Not until the Jewel was jerked 
from my limp fingers did I raise my 
head and roll back onto my 
haunches. No one had been follow- 
ing me through the Pattern — I was 
certain that I would have been 
aware of it. Therefore .... 

The light was almost normal, and 
blinking against it, I looked up into 
Brand’s smiling face. He wore a 
black eyepatch now, and he held 
the Jewel in his hand. He must have 
teleported himself in. 

He struck me just as I raised my 
head, and I fell onto my left side. 
He kicked me in the stomach then, 
hard. 

“Well, you’ve done it,” he said. 
“I did not think you could. Now I 
have another Pattern to destroy be- 
fore I set things right. I need this to 
turn the battle at the Courts first, 
though.” He waved the Jewel. 
“Good-bye for now.” 

And he vanished. 

I lay there gasping and clutching 
at my stomach. Waves of blackness 
rose and fell, like a surf, within me, 
though I did not completely suc- 
cumb to unconsciousness. A feeling 
of enormous despair washed over 
me, and 1 closed my eyes and 
moaned. There was no Jewel for me 
to draw upon now, either. 

The chestnut trees ....

E.F. SCHUMACHER, RIP 



Last night I received a gift from 
a character in one of my books. At 
least that’s what my friend Bob 
Prehoda ( Designing the Future, 
Chilton Press) claims, and he ought 
to know. Bob says that he is the 
remote ancestor of Trader Horace 
Bury, Magnate, who appears in The 
Mote in God’s Eye, and that his 
remote descendant asked him to de- 
liver the gift to me, presumably be- 
cause I have been Bury’s chroni- 
cler. 

None of which would be of any 
interest to galaxy readers except 
that during the conversation, Bob 
told me that E. F. Schumacher, 



guru of the Appropriate Technology 
Movement, died this week and we 
fell to reminiscences about the AP 
movement. Prehoda was to have 
confronted Schumacher in a seminar 
at the Center for the Study of 
Democratic Institutions later this 
year and remembered the last time 
he’d been in a debate with the late 
economist. 

Certainly the man cared. Unlike 
the Grinch, Schumacher’s heart was 
several sizes too large. He wanted 
people to be happy and the subtitle 
of his Small is Beautiful: Economics 
as If People Mattered sums up his 
view of life. If one is judged by 



106 



GALAXY 




one’s intentions, Schumacher has 
ascended to Paradise. 

If the High Gods judge us by our 
consequences, the man may be in 
the blackest pits of Hell. 

Bob’s story is typical: in the 
course of one of the seminars at the 
Santa Barbara Center, Prehoda men- 
tioned that magnetic-confinement 
fusion systems would probably re- 
quire temperatures in the order of 
50 million degrees Kelvin — and 
Schumacher was horrified. 

“How can you contemplate such 
hellish temperatures? It’s terrify- 
ing,” said the sage; and no amount 
of explanation of the nature of 
plasmas (the pressures inside a fu- 
sion reactor would be called a 
high-grade industrial vacuum in 
most contexts) could induce him to 
change his opinion. 

His ignorance of modern technol- 
ogy and engineering was profound 
and apparently unbreachable. Yet 
Schumacher was the leader of a 
powerful movement; he had much 
to say about coal and oil and non- 
renewable resources that ought to 
have been listened to; his analysis 
of the problems of developing coun- 
tries ought to be required reading 
for anyone involved with such 
things. In 1953, as a member of 
Britain’s Coal Resources Board, he 
predicted the energy crisis. He was 
a man of power — and his conclu- 
sions were based on nonsense, pro- 
found ignorance, utter contempt for 
physics and science. Should leaders 
be held responsible for what they do 



not know? 

At a recent convention I was 
sought out by a young man who is 
an advisor to a powerful Con- 
gressman. The Congressman is con- 
cerned with science and technology. 
His advisor is concerned with 
ethics, and was obviously under the 
influence of Schumacher and the 
AP movement. And lo, the young 
man’s knowledge of elementary 
physics and engineering is best de- 
scribed in charitable terms. It is 
worse than lacking; if he thought he 
knew nothing of the subject, we 
would all be better off. Instead, he 
is possessed of a series of cliches 
and half-truths and slogans. He is, 
after all, concerned with ethics, not 
engineering, and I suppose feels no 
need to study anything as dry and 
inhuman as equations and the cal- 
culus. 

In his defense I will say that he 
was willing to listen and to believe 
that much of what he thought he 
knew as truth was simple nonsense 
not even accepted by the more re- 
sponsible anti -technology people. 
Indeed, despite the nonsense that 
passed for physics in his intellectual 
armory, he was, overall, highly in 
favor of technology on ethical 
grounds. 

Should he be held responsible for 
what he does not know? 

Not long ago, here in southern 
California, there was a mass dem- 
onstration against expansion of the 
San Onofre Nuclear Power Station. 
One of the demonstrators who came

in from the East Coast was an old 
friend, a Chaucerian scholar of 
some importance and great readabil- 
ity. I had not seen him for years 
and he telephoned to say that he 
would be out here, and that perhaps 
we could renew old acquaintances, 
even though we are very much on 
the opposite sides of the San Onofre 
question. 

He arrived and we talked by tele- 
phone but we did not meet. He left 
right after the demonstration. He is 
allergic to smog and he couldn’t 
stand our southern California air. It 
never occurred to him that his ac- 
tivities might be contributing to our 
air problem. Is he responsible for 
his ignorance? Or is Schumacher? 

★ * * 

E. F. Schumacher’s major thesis 
was that a narrowly conceived profit 
motive should not be the sole deci- 
sion criterion for major questions; 
that economics ought to be consid- 
ered “as if people mattered.” There 
are, he said, questions of public 
policy involved in the implementa- 
tion of technology. There are 
questions of ethics, of human de- 
velopment and human pain, of 
esthetics; and in addition to those 
already living, the unborn have a 
right to be considered. 

Who can fault that view? Cer- 
tainly no one who pretends to be 
conservative. From Edmund Burke 
on, the great conservative theorists 



have emphasized that society is 
more than a joint stock company for 
trading in coffee and tea; that a na- 
tion is a pact between the living, 
the dead and those yet to live; that 
the profit motive is a fine thing but 
hardly the end for which mankind 
labors. 

Schumacher has, after all, said no 
more than St. Thomas Aquinas: that 
prudence is a cardinal virtue. One 
ought to give thought to the con- 
sequences of one’s actions and take 
responsibility not merely for what 
one intends, but what is likely to 
happen. 

But did Schumacher, do the 
Appropriate Technology people, 
live by this stricture?

By the sweat of thy face shalt 
thou eat bread. No one has, at least 
to my knowledge, interpreted that to 
mean what it literally says: that not 
even animal power may be used in 
cultivation; that all agriculture must 
be hand work and stoop labor. And 
if by the sweat of one’s face must 
one eat bread, it is also true that no 
economy based on human labor will 
ever produce penicillin. If we truly 
love mankind, we must be con- 
cerned with more than muscle 
power. 

It is easily arguable that energy 
resources are the most humane, the 
most liberating, the most humaniz- 
ing technologies ever developed.

Given energy, the world may be 
more than fed: there can be leisure. 
Given energy, everyone can be free 
in real terms: free to travel, free to 
enjoy good health, free to com- 
municate with others across long 
distances, free to create for the sake 
of creation, free to enjoy art. 
Energy and technology have given 
the masses real freedoms, real 
choices, choices that matter; energy 
and technology have given to the 
masses the freedoms only dreamed 
of by the most powerful aristocrats 
of past centuries. The greatest king 
on Earth could not, when my father 
was young, travel across the United 
States in hours; now almost anyone 
can. Neither Rockefellers nor 
Rothschilds had penicillin in 1900; 
by the year 2000 the vast majority 
of the Earth will have penicillin and 
more as a matter of birthright. 

I need not labor the point. Surely 
we can all agree that modem life is 
not merely more comfortable, but 
more humane, than was life in the 
past; and that this is due to technol- 
ogy and energy resources. We may 
not agree that the game is worth the 
candle; we may disagree about the 
costs; but surely there have been 
great benefits? 

Now true: there exists a group of 
middle-class anti -technocrats who 
have a meaner view of the Earth; 
who wish the benefits of industry 
and science, of wealth, to be 
restricted to a favored few; who 
ask, “What are those street sweep- 
ers doing on my beach?” and curse 



when they find the low-bom tramp- 
ing through their national parks. 
There are probably more of such 
people than admit to it and they 
have a valid point, namely that 
some esthetic experiences by their 
very nature can be enjoyed only by 
a few; some pleasures are destroyed 
for all when all try to enjoy them. I 
am not concerned with these people 
here because few will openly argue 
their case. They may be right, but 
the intellectual and emotional 
temper of the times is much against 
them, and they know it. They do 
not come forward openly, but hide 
among others. 

Surely, though, E. F. Schu- 
macher was not one of those. 
Surely he truly believed that his 
work was beneficial to man; that he 
was practicing “economics as if 
people mattered.” If the conse- 
quence of what he taught was to 
make us all a little (or a lot) poorer, 
that was, for him, an unfortunate 
necessity, not a positive goal. 

No: on his terms, and in his in- 
tentions, Schumacher was a good 
man. 

But what was his effect on the 
world? 

★ ★ * 

“Of all the changes introduced 
by man into the household of na- 
ture, large-scale nuclear fission is 
undoubtedly the most dangerous 
and profound. As a result, ioniz- 
ing radiation has become the 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



109 




most serious agent of pollution 
of the environment and the 
greatest threat to man’s survival 
on earth. The attention of the 
layman, not surprisingly, has 
been captured by the atom bomb, 
although there is at least a 
chance that it may never be used 
again. The danger to humanity 
created by the so-called peaceful 
uses of atomic energy may be 
much greater.” 

From Small is Beautiful, p. 135. 

Strong words and noble senti- 
ments — but are they true? Has man 
invented a new technology so terri- 
ble in its possible consequences that 
it might make the entire earth unin- 
habitable? If so, are we not better 
off without it? 

But here we enter a realm where 
noble sentiments are not enough. 
We have come to a regime of facts 
and hard numbers, of engineering 
and data; and Schumacher is egre- 
giously wrong. 

In the first place, nuclear reactors 
are not new. Mankind didn’t invent 
them. A billion years ago a natural 
reactor operated periodically in Af- 
rica (in what is now the Republic of 
Gabon). There was natural uranium 
close to the surface and when water 
flowed into these uranium pockets 
to act as a moderator, the deposits 
went critical. For half a million 
years or more an average of 20 kW 
of thermal power was generated un- 
tended. Tons of plutonium were 
created, along with six tons of fis- 



sion products. None of this was re- 
moved, decontaminated, recycled, 
placed in deep mines or indeed dis- 
turbed by human hands; yet the 
Earth was not destroyed. 

Schumacher made his reputation 
as a member of the Coal Resources 
Board and argued forcefully against 
closing down Europe’s coal produc- 
tion back in the fifties when oil was 
plentiful and cheap. He was cer- 
tainly vindicated by the energy 
crisis but the fact remains that he 
was a strong advocate of coal 
technology. Yet because of natural 
radioactivity present in coal, the 
radiation released to the environ- 
ment by a coal-fired electrical 
power plant is about 180 times the 
dose put out by a nuclear plant of 
equal capacity; indeed, if coal 
plants were under the jurisdiction of 
the Nuclear Regulatory Commis- 
sion, they would be in violation of 
NRC standards and have to close 
down. And note: this radioactivity 
is released with no monitoring, 
dumped out the stack close to the 
surface of the Earth, let float free in 
the atmosphere. Of course it isn’t 
dangerous. The amount is trivial. 
But it is much greater than the 
radioactivity put forth by nuclear 
plants. 

No one now says that a nuclear 
plant might “go off like a bomb”; 
even the most ignorant of nuclear 
opponents knows better than that. 
Yet we have books such as We Al- 
most Lost Detroit which strongly 
imply it, and enjoy distribution by 



110 



GALAXY 




appropriate technology advocates. 
No member of the public has ever 
been injured by a nuclear power 
plant accident. All the “catas- 
trophes” involving nuclear power 
are on paper. They are mere 
theories and speculations. There are 
arguments about whether a nuclear 
accident costing a billion dollars 
might happen once in a every ten 
thousand years, or every thousand. 

Yet — the probability that we will 
pay a billion dollars in compensa- 
tion to the victims of coal power is 
unity. We already pay a billion 
each year in Black Lung compensa- 
tion. 

The worst theoretical accident 
postulated for a nuclear plant — an 
accident that can happen once every 
million years, or hundred thousand 
years, or perhaps as often as every 
thousand years — might kill three 
thousand people. This assumes a 
large power plant near a large city; 
that a guillotine cut-in which no 
coolant flow whatever continues 
happens to cooling lines; that all the 
emergency systems fail; that the 
reactor crew is unable to introduce 
coolant manually through the sev- 
ered pipe; that the three-foot rein- 
forced concrete containment is 
broached; that the reactor core melts 
through the six-inch steel reactor 
vessel; that there is a temperature 
inversion that day; that the radioac- 
tive leak comes out as fine particles 
rather than as chunks; and that a 
strong wind is blowing from the 
reactor to the city. Given all this, 



and that the city is not evacuated 
(there would be several hours’ 
warning), the reactor accident might 
kill three thousand people. 

In December 1952, thirty-nine 
hundred people died in London as a 
result of air pollution from coal 
burning. The number of people in 
southern California killed by smog 
is not known but it is not zero. 

In The Health Hazards of Not 
Going Nuclear Dr. Petr Beckmann 
of the University of Colorado (the 
book is available for $5.95 from 
Petr Beckmann, Box 1342, Boul- 
der, Colorado 80302) details a long 
comparison between the hazards of 
our present methods of generating 
power, and what would happen if 
we converted to nuclear power 
plants. The conclusion is interest- 
ing: many lives would be saved. 

But perhaps Beckmann — and the 
nuclear engineers and scientists on 
whose studies he has relied — are 
wrong? Is this not a matter of con- 
troversy? 

Perhaps. Saying so will not 
change the fact that we are killing 
people with our present methods of 
power generation. It may be con- 
troversial as to which is more 
dangerous, coal or nuclear power; 
but at least the advocates of nuclear 
power have examined the conse- 
quences of their stand. Of the dan- 
gers of coal and fossil fuels you 
will find in Schumacher little more 
than this: 

“What, after all, is the fouling 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



111 




of air with smoke compared with 
the pollution of air, water, and 
soil with ionizing radiation? Not 
that I wish in any way to belittle 
the evils of conventional air and 
water pollution; but we must 
recognise ‘dimensional differ- 
ences’ when we encounter them: 
radioactive pollution is an evil of 
an incomparably greater ‘dimen- 
sion’ than anything mankind has 
known before. One might even 
ask, what is the point of insisting 
on clean air, if the air is laden 
with radioactive particles? And 
even if the air could be pro- 
tected, what is the point of it, if 
the soil and water are being 
poisoned?” 

Needless to say, neither 
Schumacher nor his followers are 
interested in the answers to such 
questions. When one attempts to 
show an advocate of “appropriate 
technology” the technological means 
by which problems such as nuclear 
“wastes” may be disposed of, the 
reaction is seldom polite. 
“Technological quick fixes” are of 
no interest because by definition 
such technology is “inappropriate.” 
For them, nuclear wastes are not 
real physical objects. If the entire 
United States operated exclusively 
on nuclear power, the wastes gener- 
ated would be about the size of an 
aspirin tablet for each of us each 
year. The resulting mess could be 
stored above ground in the Mojave 
Desert for centuries, assuming that 



nothing better could be devised; but 
that is the real world. To 
Schumacher and his followers, 
“nuclear wastes” are objects of ter- 
ror: 

“The most massive wastes 
are, of course, the nuclear reac- 
tors themselves after they have 
become unserviceable . they 
cannot be dismantled and cannot 
be shifted, but have to be left 
standing where they are, prob- 
ably for centuries, perhaps for 
thousands of years, an active 
menace to all life, silently leak- 
ing radioactivity into air, water, 
and soil. No one has considered 
the number and location of these 
satanic mills which will re- 
lentlessly accumulate.” 

This is good poetry; but of course 
“someone” has considered the 
problem. Indeed, there are thou- 
sands of pages of testimony before 
Congressional Committees, stacks 
of reports, blueprints, studies, 
tests, demonstration projects — all 
of which Schumacher can ignore 
in favor of discussions of “satanic 
mills.” Confronted by engineer- 
ing studies, Schumacher could 
declare: 

“No amount of prosperity 
could justify the accumulation of 
large quantitites of highly toxic 
substances which nobody knows 
how to make ‘safe’ and which 
remain an incalculable danger to 



112 



GALAXY 




the whole of creation for histori- 
cal or even geological ages.” 

When told that the dangers were 
not “incalculable” and that in fact 
the calculations had been made, his 
answer was: “To do such a thing is 
a transgression against life itself, a 
transgression infinitely more serious 
than any crime ever perpetrated by 
man. The idea that a civilization 
could sustain itself on the basis of 
such a transgression is an ethical, 
spiritual, and metaphysical mon- 
strosity. It means conducting the 
economic affairs of man as if 
people really did not matter at all.” 
This is the language of the Old 
Testament, not of science; it is 
Jeremiah let loose among us; for of 
course Schumacher did not want 
engineering answers to technologi- 
cal problems. Nuclear power was 
for him the more dangerous the 
safer it could be made: for it let 
loose the genie of plenty and 
“prosperity” on the world — and 
that, to Schumacher, was evil in it- 
self. 

* + * 

“When I first began to travel 
the world, visiting rich and poor 
countries alike, I was tempted to 
formulate the first law of 
economics as follows: ‘The 

amount of real leisure a society 
enjoys tends to be in inverse 
proportion to the amount of 
labor-saving machinery it em- 
ploys. 



“The evidence is very strong 
indeed. If you go from easy- 
going England to, say, Germany 
or the United States, you find 
that people there live under much 
more strain than here. And if 
you move to a country like 
Burma, which is very near to the 
bottom of the league table of in- 
dustrial progress, you find that 
people have an enormous amount 
of leisure really to enjoy them- 
selves.” 

Could Schumacher have believed 
that? Surely he knew that, given the 
opportunity, many Burmese would 
move to England or the United 
States but that there was little traffic 
the other way. For that matter, al- 
though he spent a number of years 
as economic advisor to one or 
another of the generals who ruled 
Burma, Schumacher himself did not 
choose to live there — and while he 
was resident, he did not live at the 
peasant subsistence level. 

And yet his understanding of the 
problems of the Third World was 
often profound. His insistence on 
* ‘ intermediate technology ’ ’ rather 
than the latest products of Detroit 
and Liverpool; his popularization of 
the concept of technology “appro- 
priate” to the places where it was 
to be introduced; above all, his un- 
derstanding that a man who makes 
ten dollars a year will be discour- 
aged and defeated by machinery 
costing hundreds of thousands of 
dollars, but might aspire to owner- 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



113 




ship of tools costing only twenty 
dollars; all these were real contribu- 
tions to the happiness of mankind. 

It is this which is so exasperating 
about the Schumachers of this 
world. They understand that man 
does not live by aerosol cans alone; 
that there is a profound inherent dif- 
ficulty with a society that produces 
more and more people who can 
make little or no contribution to it; 
that as we increasingly divorce 
meaning from work, we produce a 
generation that hates its jobs. They 
understand this; but they do not 
seem able to understand that, given 
the choice, most would prefer the 
boring assembly-line job and the 
gadgets and aerosol cans to a life of 
farming. 

Technology makes choices real. 
Primitive man is close to “meaning- 
ful work” and close to the soil be- 
cause he must be. Primitive man 
has no choice but to eat bread 
through the sweat of his face. To 
denounce modem technology is to 
denounce choice, to say that people 
must have their lives decided for 
them; and there are many in the 
appropriate technology movement 
ready to make these choices — for 
others. 

And yet, having said all that; 
having said that E. F. Schumacher 
may well have have assisted at the 
birth of a world he would not love, 
one must give him credit. He was 
good at pricking balloons, and all 
the silliness was hardly confined to 
his side of the debate. 



He was at his best when discus- 
sing the needs of developing na- 
tions: 

“Everything sounds very dif- 
ficult and in a sense it is very 
difficult if it is done for the 
people, instead of by the people. 
But let us not think that de- 
velopment or employment is any- 
thing but the most natural thing 
in the world. It occurs in every 
healthy person’s life. There 
comes a time when he simply 
sets to work. In a sense this is 
much easier to do now than it 
has ever been in human- history. 
Why? Because there is so much 
more knowledge. 

“So let’s not mesmerize our- 
selves by the difficulties, but re- 
cover the commonsense view 
that to work is the most natural 
thing in the world. Only one 
must not be blocked by being too 
damn clever about it. ... I think 
the stupid man who says ‘some- 
thing is better than nothing’ is 
much more intelligent than the 
clever chap who will not let us 
touch anything unless it is opti- 
mal. What is stopping [India]? 
Theories, planning. I have come 
across planners at the Planning 
Commission who have convinced 
themselves that even within fif- 
teen years it is not possible to 
put the willing labor power of 
India to work . this is just a 
sort of degeneracy of the in- 
tellect.” 



114 



GALAXY 




This is a man in righteous wrath 
at “social engineers” who want ev- 
erything planned before anything 
can start; who will not give the 
people a scythe because it is a 
waste, what with the tractor coming 
in a few months. It is Schumacher 
at his best and one wishes he had 
stayed with what he knew — 
intermediate technology, simplifica- 
tion of work for a people trying to 
pull themselves forward from the 

I Ith century. 

* * * 

It is traditional to speak only 
good of the dead. Perhaps I should 
end with Schumacher’s best but I 
cannot. An uglier image thrusts it- 
self forward. 

In 146 B.C. the Romans captured 
Carthage. The city was destroyed 
and the site ritually sown with salt. 
The great library was burned. The 
records of the Phoenicians were 
lost. We now know that Phoenician 
ships had sailed clear around Africa; 
there is mounting evidence that 
there were Phoenician colonies in 
(he New World. The books were 
burned and the knowledge lost 
forever. 

In A.D. 640 the Caliph Omar 
burned the Great Library of 
Alexandria. “If the writings of the 
Greeks are consistent with the Book 
of God (Koran), they are not 
needed; if they are not, they are 
heresy. Bum them all,” he ordered. 

I I is son spent a lifetime gathering 
the pitiful remnants of the greatest 



collection of knowledge then as- 
sembled in the world. 

In 1204 the Franks burned the 
Great Library of the Hagia Sophia 
in Constantinople. Much that had 
survived Omar was lost then. 

What has this to do with 
Schumacher? He said, not once but 
several times, that if all the books 
on nuclear technology could be as- 
sembled in one place, he would 
cheerfully set them alight — to pro- 
duce steam. Steam is “appropriate” 
technology for man. Nuclear is not. 

And mankind faces a critical de- 
cision. This generation, and perhaps 
the next, has the riches and the 
knowledge to take us from this 
planet and put us into the solar sys- 
tem. For the moment, a very brief 
moment in human history, we have 
the wealth and we could go forth 
into space. Whether by doing so we 
would forever “solve” the prob- 
lems of famine and want is a matter 
for debate and discussion. My point 
is that there can be more than one 
dream. 

Each man sitting under his own 
fig tree and pruning his own vine is 
a noble vision — but it is a limited 
vision. Surely man has long had 
higher goals? Should we not have 
the choice? 

And that is the danger of 
Schumacher’s movement: it would 
deny choice. I can conceive of a fu- 
ture in which space-faring man con- 
fines high technology and adventure 
to other planets and leaves this one 
“unspoiled,” parklike, a place of 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



115 




vines and fig trees. 

I cannot believe in Schumacher’s 
future, limited to Only One Earth. 
Behind the poetic vision is the hard 
reality: without energy and technol- 
ogy lies a world in which only by 
the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat 
bread. 

★ ★ ★ 

What are we to make of “appro- 
priate technology”? It can be seduc- 
tive. Consider the vision of each 
man, woman and child in India 
planting and maintaining one tree a 
year so that after five years this 
“would give you 2,000 million es- 
tablished trees. Anyone can work it 
out on the back of an envelope that 
the economic value of such an en- 
terprise, intelligently conducted, 
would be greater than anything that 
has ever been promised by any of 
India’s five-year plans. It could be 
done without a penny of foreign 
aid; there is no problem of savings 
and investments. It would produce 
foodstuffs, fibres, building mate- 
rials, shade, water, almost anything 
that man really needs . what sort 
of education prevents us from think- 
ing of things ready to be done im- 
mediately? What makes us think we 
need electricity, cement, and steel 
before we can do anything at all?” 
This is seductive stuff, and valuable 
advice. Certainly people should not 
be encouraged to sit about doing no- 
thing until some large organization 
saves them. 



But it will never be enough. Two 
thousand million trees is still only 
five trees for each man, woman and 
child; and five trees will not provide 
foodstuffs, fibre, building material, 
“almost anything that man really 
needs.” Had appropriate technology 
stopped with the trees, the move- 
ment would be invaluable. Had it 
spoken to us, as did the slave at the 
Roman Triumph, to remind us that 
we are mortal, and that technology 
is not a goal of itself, I would 
cheerfully acquiesce in making 
Small is Beautiful required reading 
in every engineering college in the 
land. 

But it does not stop there. It goes 
on: to the Clamshell Alliance which 
seeks to halt “nuclear pollution” 
along coasts where the only 
shellfish surviving the Great Winter 
of ’76 are alive because of “thermal 
pollution” of the water; to my 
friend who came to southern 
California to halt “nuclear pollu- 
tion” of my homeland but who 
could not stay over with me because 
of the smog; to the frantic efforts to 
stop the Space Shuttle and close 
down the fusion plants. 

Let Schumacher provide his own 
epitaph: 

“What matters is the direction 
of research, that the direction 
should be towards non-violence 
rather than violence; towards an 
harmonious cooperation with na- 
ture rather than a warfare against 
nature; towards the noiseless, 



116 



GALAXY 




low-energy, elegant, and econom- 
ical solutions normally applied 
in nature rather than the noisy, 
high-energy, brutal, wasteful, 
and clumsy solutions of our 
present-day sciences. 

“The continuation of scientific 
advance in the direction of ever- 
increasing violence, culminating 
in nuclear fission and moving on 
to nuclear fusion, , is a prospect 
of terror threatening the abolition 
of man.’’ 

Strong words, words which he 
must have believed: but how is a 
coal mine less violent than San 
Onofre? How is the hellish blast of 
a boiler, the strip-mining of Black 
Mesa, the slurry pipeline across 
Arizona and New Mexico, less 
noisy than the near-silent hum of 
the turbines in a modem nuclear 
plant? 

Of course I have used loaded 
words, as did Schumacher, and 
there is the point. Mankind will not 
be saved by talk of “hellish tem- 
peratures” and “satanic mills” any 
more than it will be saved by Carl 
Sandberg’s poetic hymns to 
Chicago. We live in a world that 
needs poets and poetic vision; but it 
needs at least as much those who 
can understand Maxwell’s equa- 
tions. 

It is possible that advocates of 
nuclear power — myself among 
them — are wrong. What is not ac- 
ceptable is that public policy be de- 
cided by the exchange of irrational 



slogans. 

And the decision is important. It 
is not simply a matter of putting off 
nuclear power because “it might 
kill the lot of us.” So “might” a 
number of things — including wars 
and famines brought on by lack of 
energy resources. True, discussion 
of policies must not be confined 
merely to equations. Esthetics must 
enter. There is more to life than 
simple survival, and a great deal 
more than profit. 

But is not e = me 2 as elegant as 
a sonnet? 

Schumacher leaves two legacies. 
The one is a reminder that there is 
more than economics. People must 
do what they can. It is the vision of 
every man, woman and child in 
India planting a tree and tending it. 
It is the vision of a world in which 
all can participate and all are 
needed. 

The other is an uglier legacy: of 
arguments from ignorance; of fol- 
lowers who convince themselves 
they are right because they are 
“concerned”; of “ecologists” who 
know no ecology; of modem Lud- 
dites who, not content with planting 
trees, must sabotage the power 
plants; of the irrational belief that 
because one’s heart is pure, one 
need know no more than poetic 
phrases and catchy slogans; of an 
anti-rational world. 

We can hope that the one legacy 
will die, and the other live after 
him.

JOHN 
HENRY 
AND THE 

BY LEE 
WHIPPLE 



Ills PICTURE WAS GONE. 

Inside his mind he could still see 
himself in the glossy black and 
white: A quiet pose, seated on a 
stool with his white-faced guitar 
balanced lightly against his knee, 
the words “John Henry Roberts 
Appearing Nightly. Last Live Enter- 
tainment in Chicago” printed be- 
low. 

Several times his eyes and mind 
played leap-frog, projecting his pic- 
ture for an instant upon the empty 
display-board; his pride was buying 
a second or two to absorb and ad- 
just. But the picture was gone. John 
Henry knew this. And why. 

The Ultra-Media marquee, much 
like the ones over other nightspots 
in Chicago, was already up; it 
blared its menu of media delights in 
bright colors — “world cup yacht 

RACING,” “SCENES FROM VENUS,” 

“star travel symphony” — A Col- 
lection Of Music From Other 
Worlds.” 

A ring of dull-glowing suns cir- 
cled the marquee, indicating the 
Ultra-Media system within was 
complete with patron feedback, in- 
stant coordination, World Premier 
capacity. The dull suns on the mar- 
quee might at any instant blaze into 
an electric fire- storm of white and 
yellow and blue light — signaling to 
people on the street the computer- 
assisted system inside had struck on 
a novel combination, matching pat- 
ron mood and desire with media 
capacity stored in its memory 
banks and, at that moment, was 



producing a completely unique 
media experience. 

The old sign “Ramon’s,” was 
still in its place over the door. But 
you had to squint and shield your 
eyes with a hand to see it. 

John Henry stood in the glare of 
the Ultra- Media marquee, its elec- 
tric song an omen — especially for 
him. He stared at the empty 
display-board where only yesterday 
his picture had been; he stared and 
suffered his feelings of hurt and 
surprise; he allowed self-pity, 
wasp-like, to dance in his eyes like 
the light from the marquee itself. 
Finally he brushed it away. 

A fine anger began to build 
within him. 

He went inside. 

★ ★ ★ 

‘‘Ramon, how could you do this? 
Ramon . .” 

Ramon stood behind the bar, 
polishing a glass. The Ultra-Media 
Experience Machine, a silver cloud, 
floated silently at the far end of the 
room; a bank of computers covered 
an adjacent wall. 

“I am sorry, my friend. Truly, I 
am sorry,” Ramon said as he 
studied the glass he was holding, 
rubbing it with exaggerated care. 

“You should have told me 
.... Jesus, at least you could have 
told me.” 

“I tried, John Henry, last night, 
last week ... I could not. I am 
sorry.” 



THE ULTRA-MEDIA EXPERIENCE

John Henry cursed shortly; he put 
his guitar case down oti the floor 
and turned, leaning his back against 
the bar. “Give me a beer, Ramon. 
You still serve beer, I hope — or do 
we watch that on the machine now 
too?” 

Ramon drew the beer in silence 
and placed it on the bar. John 
Henry took it, a small sign of peace 
between them. He drank slowly and 
looked at the crowd. 

Several familiar faces, people 
who came to hear him play: They 
talked earnestly across the tables, 
glancing now and again in his direc- 
tion, then quickly away. Bits of 
conversation floated over the 
room — 

“It’s not the same, no machine 
will ever . .” 

“Last place in Chicago, the bat- 
tle’s over . .” 

“. machine’s better, face it.” 
“Live entertainment’s dead, 
that’s all there is to it.” 

John Henry glanced at the clock. 
Ten minutes to show time. He 
looked at the dark cellar walls and 
the ancient stairs leading up to the 
street; he thought about the 1940s, 
and jazz, and what it must have 
been like. 

“John, what are you going to 
do?” Ramon asked. “What about 
the theater, anything there?” 

John Henry laughed. “I was out 
of the acting business when 1 started 
here — there hasn’t been a live play 
in Chicago in three years.” 

“Why don’t you sign up with 



one of the media companies? You’re 
good, John. You’d do all right.” 

“No.” 

“Why, John?” 

“The same reason you were the 
last club in Chicago to hire a live 
musician. Don’t ask me why. You 
know why, Ramon.” 

“Aw John, don’t. Things have 
changed. You gotta know that. I 
couldn’t have lasted another 
year — ” 

“Yeah, I know that, Ramon. I 
know that.” Another glance at the 
clock. Time to go. Maybe you 
couldn’t stand in its way. But you 
didn’t have to watch. “See you, 
huh — ” 

John Henry got almost to the 
door. He was pushed back inside by 
a stampede of customers. 

★ * * 

The dull suns on the marquee had 
gone bright, calling people from the 
evening-crowded Chicago street into 
Ramon’s. A World Premier media 
experience was about to happen. 

“What luck,” someone said, “to 
be right outside.” 

“I’ve never seen a Premier, this 
is my first,” said another. 

“You’re in for something, that’s 
for sure — they don’t do this unless 
they’ve really got something . 
someone answered. 

The club was nearly full. John 
Henry was pushed back against the 
bar, painfully near the stage where 
he used to perform.

GALAXY 




The silver cloud began to glow; 
lights blinked along the computers. 
People hurried toward tables, carry- 
ing liters of beer and sangria and 
starlight wine, some balancing five 
and six glasses. The crowd before 
the bar remained several deep. 
Ramon hurriedly handed drinks and 
collected money. 

“GOOD EVENING, LADIES AND 
GENTLEMEN. WELCOME TO AN 
ULTRA-MEDIA WORLD PREMIER,” a 
holographic anchor-man spoke from 
his desk amidst the silver cloud. 
“The Ultra-Media, patron feedback, 
instant coordination system has 
matched the moods and desires pres- 
ent in this very room, just a few 
minutes ago, with the most exten- 
sive media-experience library in the 
world. A completely unique, once 
only, media experience is about to 
occur — and you are here!” 

The silver cloud blinked and the 
anchor-man was gone. Three- 
dimensional letters, red in a mist of 
yellow, floated within the cloud — 

John Henry 
vs 

The Ultra-Media 
Experience Machine 

John Henry removed his guitar 
from its case and moved to the lit- 
tle stage near the bar; he sat down 
on the familiar stool and hooked a 
heel beneath him. 

“I accept,” he said. 

The lights along the computers 
flashed briefly, matter-of-factly: 



“This was not a question,” they 
seemed to say. 

John Henry could feel the great 
silver eye studying him, recording, 
no doubt, his heart beat, the dilation 
of his pupils, changes in Galvanic 
skin response; he put on his best 
poker-face and tried to calm his in- 
sides. 

A trumpet note sounded. The 
cloud glowed briefly, blinked, and 
an official-looking man appeared 
near the bar. “Rules of the Con- 
test,” he began and then, as John 
Henry listened, ticked them off. 
Both he and the machine were to 
have an opening statement. The re- 
mainder of the contest was to be 
unstructured, the method of resolu- 
tion undetermined, choice of com- 
munication medias unrestricted. 
Rough and tumble, no holds barred, 
John Henry translated. Fair enough. 

The cloud blinked and the offic- 
ial-looking man was gone. 

“Agreed,” said John Henry. 

The lights along the computers 
flashed matter-of-factly again. 

A gold coin appeared in the air; it 
landed with a convincing metal- 
on-wood vibrato near one of the ta- 
bles. 

“Tails,” John Henry called. 

“It’s tails, that’s what it is,” 
cried a man near the coin. 

The coin disappeared. 

John Henry settled himself on his 
stool and carefully tuned his in- 
strument.

THE ULTRA-MEDIA EXPERIENCE 



121 




Round One: Statements. 

A series of single notes, deep and 
clear, struck by John Henry’s fin- 
gers issued from the beautiful 
blond wood of his instrument, came 
brightly into the air and hung in 
perfect orbs of sounds, each one 
fading just as another came to sing 
in its place. Prelude No. IX by 
Johan Sebastian Bach spoke clearly 
across the centuries, eloquent, ob- 
livious to time. 

The single notes mixed and sang 
together and then went off again on 
their separate ways: Two converg- 
ing ideas, blending perfectly at 
times in a single note, then separat- 
ing gracefully, their identities intact. 
John Henry’s head was bent as in 
prayer — speaking and listening in 
the same moment. 

The last notes were allowed to 
dim and fade into silence. Then, 
explosive applause. 

Ramon came from behind the bar 
and handed John Henry a cold glass 
of beer. “You can win, John 
Henry, I can feel it.” He touched 
John Henry’s arm and returned. 

The room was becoming quiet. 
John Henry took a long drink from 
his glass and waited. 

Bartholomew Diaz, some thirty 
years deceased, considered by many 
as great as Tarrega, appeared beside 
the cloud. He sat quietly, his guitar, 
inlaid with silver and gold, held 
ready. 

A deep announcer’s voice filled 
the room: “Ladies and gentlemen 
— In the mountain village of 

122 



Taranto, in the heel of the boot 
which is Italy, a young woman has 
been bitten by the dreaded tarantula. 
It is legend that if one dances the 
‘Tarantella’ long enough and hard 
enough, it will prevent the onset of 
coma and the certain death which 
follows. The young woman’s lover 
has brought a guitarist; they will 
dance for her life and for their 
love . .” 

The cloud glowed softly, reveal- 
ing the village square of Taranto. A 
young couple surrounded by somber- 
faced family and friends swept into 
the square. A man with a guitar 
leaned against a nearby tree, 
obscure in its shadows. The young 
man and woman looked anxiously 
at one another; they embraced. 

Bartholomew Diaz lifted his 
guitar and struck the first vibrant 
notes of Tedesdo’s ‘ ‘Tarantella. ’ ’ The 
young woman and her lover began 
to dance. 

Diaz, the master, lifted the tempo 
gradually at first. Then faster and 
faster, embellishing the keyboard of 
his instrument with dazzling grace. 
The young couple danced faster and 
faster, the young man compelling 
his lover with the language of his 
body and eyes. 

The light in the village square 
slowly faded from afternoon into 
dusk. Torches appeared in the hands 
of the hopeful watchers, casting 
strange shadows. 

Stars appeared, then the moon 
added its silver light. 

And ever the tempo increased, 

GALAXY 




became furious as the couple 
danced wildly, beautifully. 

A faint light began to show in the 
sky, reddened softly, and then burst 
into dawn. The music stopped. 

The villagers ran into the square 
shouting and embracing; the young 
couple clung to one another trium- 
phantly; the guitarist was being car- 
ried on the shoulders of several 
men; children were running and 
leaping into the air. It was over, the 
lime of danger was past. 

In Ramon’s the scene was not 
dissimilar. A pandemonium was 
loose; a wild celebration was 
underway. John Henry, himself, 
was on his feet applauding. 

★ ★ ★ 

Round Two: Replies. 

When the room was finally quiet, 
when the clapping and shouting had 
finally died, when the crowd had 
once more taken their seats and 
turned themselves to hear John Hen- 
ry’s reply — he had nothing to say. 
He sat lost in the brilliance of his 
opponent’s performance. Doubt had 
grown into a cancer and was eating 
his soul. 

Perhaps he was wrong; perhaps 
the day of the live entertainer was 
gone; perhaps he had confused 
depth with mere sentiment, was 
clinging to a thing whose time was 
rightly past. Perhaps, perhaps .... 

The strains of Bola Sete’s “Guitar 
Lamento” reached John Henry’s 
ears, the dark South American sor- 



row strangely his own, somehow 
right. It was with great difficulty his 
mind accepted that it was he who 
was playing it. 

His emotion had spread through- 
out his being, into his hands which 
touched his guitar unknowing and 
gave voice to his heart. And the 
beauty of his sorrow gave him 
strength. 

The song finished. John Henry 
put aside his guitar and found in 
his head the words of an obscure 
poet of the late 1900s; although he 
had only read the poem in passing, 
long before, the words came forth — 

‘ ‘for the days — 

When enemies 
had faces 
Before relativity 
captured the heart 
and locked it securely 
up in the brain 
Already rotting 
from too much 
too soon. 

for the days — 
of Right 
When light 
in the heart 
turned body 
to spirit 

A bright candle flame 
in the wind. 
for the days — 

When vision was clear 
The Captain 

with luminant stars 
Not yet lost 



THE ULTRA-MEDIA EXPERIENCE 



123 




in the seas 
of time. 

Oh David — 

You never crouched 
in the dark 

Wondering 
if Goliath 
wasn’t just 

Doing a job 
for a cause that 
after all 
might be as 
worthy as yours.” 

The room was silent. For a mo- 
ment John Henry was not sure he 
had spoken and played; it seemed 
something which might have occur- 
red in his mind alone. 

But there came applause, sus- 
tained and earnest, comprehending. 

Aurora Borealis, the northern 
lights, leapt into the room, swirling, 
brilliant, dazzling — as seen from the 
Arctic winter night. Then closer and 
closer, and finally within .... 

John Henry played Powell and 
Lennon and McCartney, and 
Pouchini; he did scenes from 
Shakespeare and Gardner and Ly- 
man; he recited Lorca and Kipling 
and Twain, and even the Gettysburg 
Address, and the preamble to the 
Star-Peace Agreement of Worlds. 
The Experience Machine brought in 
the World Company Ballet; it mixed 
a symphony of the greatest mu- 
sicians of two hundred years; it took 

124 



the audience into fires and earth- 
quakes, into the womb itself, and 
to the super-nova of a sun. It strung 
a high-wire act over the tables and 
patrons themselves; but John Henry 
balanced on one leg and juggled 
three cocktail glasses and somehow 
captured the audience away. 

John Henry chipped and wore at 
the machine; he poked fun, and 
applauded, and spoke from his soul. 
And slowly the audience turned to 
him. Slowly they tired of being as- 
tonished and dazzled and having 
their breath taken away; they were 
like rich children finally done with 
too much candy and cake,, turning 
to apples and homemade bread. 

John Henry could feel the audi- 
ence with him but it was late and 
he was tired; the machine was not. 
He searched through himself for a 
finale, a final statement on which to 
rest his case. 

“John Henry was 
a li’l baby, 
uh-huh, 

Sittin’ on his 
mania’s knee, 
oh, yes. 

He picked up a 
hammer and a 
little piece of steel, 

Said, ‘Hammer's gonna be 
the death of me . 

Lawd, Lawd, 

hammer gonna be 
the death of me.’ 

The song came from deep in John 
GALAXY 




Henry’s memory, a childhood song 
he had loved, perhaps because he 
shared his name with its hero. 

“Well now every 
Monday mornin , uh-huh, 

When the bluebirds 
begin to sing . , 

You can see John Henry 
out on the line , 

You can hear John Henry’ s 
hammer ring . 

Lawd, Lawd, you can hear 
John Henry’s hammer ring.’’ 

The steady boogie picked up the 
crowd and pulled it into the song; 
they began to clap rhythmically, a 
few to sing. 

“Cap’n says to John Henry, 
huh, huh, 

‘Gonna bring me a 
steam drill 'round . 

Gonna take that steam drill 
out on the job, 

Gonna wop that steel 
on down . 

Lawd, Lawd, gonna wop 
that steel on down.' 

John Henry tol’ 

the Captain, oh, my, 

Lightnin was 
in his eye . 

‘Cap’n, bet yo’ las’ 
red cent on me. 

For I’ll beat it 
to the bottom 
or I’ll die . 

Lawd, Lawd, I’ll beat it 



to the bottom 
or I’ll die.’ " 

Every person in the crowd was 
singing; they were clapping their 
hands and stamping their feet. The 
crowd belonged to John Henry. All 
he had to do was bring them home. 

“John Henry started 
on the right hand, yes, 

The steam drill started 
on the lef — 

‘Before I'd let this 
steam drill beat me down, 

I’d hammer my fool self 
to death . 

Lawd, Lawd, I’d hammer 
my fool self to death.’ 

White man to!’ 

John Henry, oh, oh, 

‘Nigger, damn your soul . 

You might beat this 
steam drill of mine. 

When the rocks 
in this mountain 
turn to gold . 

Lawd, Lawd, when the rocks 
in this mountain 
turn to gold.’ ” 

John Henry picked up the tempo 
of the song. The crowd came with 
him, joyfully. They were racing 
now, racing for the finish line. 

“John Henry said 
to the shaker, uh-huh, 

‘Nigger, why don’t 
you sing . ? 

I’m throwin twelve poun’s 



THE ULTRA-MEDIA EXPERIENCE 



125 




from my hips on down, 

Jes’ listen to that 
col' steel ring . 

Lawd, Lawd, jes’ listen 
to that col’ steel ring.' ” 

The silver cloud began to glow; 
lights flashed along the computers. 
John Henry Roberts appeared in the 
cloud, singing, playing, his face 
alive with the moment. The crowd 
was in the cloud too, clapping, 
stamping their feet. 

John Henry, the real John Henry, 
did not notice himself at the far end 
of the room; he was too engrossed 
in his song. Only a few patrons 
stopped clapping and began to 
watch the cloud at first. 

“ Man that invented 
the steam drill, yeah. 

Thought he was mighty fine, 
yes he did, 

But John Henry drove 
near fifteen feet, 

And the steam drill 

hammered only nine . 

Lawd, Lawd, the steam drill 
hammered only nine." 

Still John Henry was oblivious 
to his own image within the cloud, 
competing. A few more people 
turned away. 

“ John Henry tol' 
the Cap'n, oh, yes, 

‘Look yonder 
what I see . 

Yo’ drill’s done broke 

and yo’ hole’s done choke. 



And you can’t 

drive steel like me . 

Lawd, Lawd, you can’t 
drive steel like me.’ 

At last John Henry noticed his 
owh image in the silver cloud. With 
a few exceptions, the entire crowd 
had turned to watch it, fascinated. 

“ John Henry was hammerin’ 
on the mountain, 

And his hammer 
was flashin fire. 

He drove so hard 

’till he broke his heart. 

And he lied down 

his hammer and died . 

Lawd, Lawd, he lied down 
his hammer and he died. 

The entire crowd, save Ramon, 
was watching John Henry and it- 
self in the silver cloud. They no 
longer clapped or sang or stamped 
their feet; but their images within 
the cloud did. 

" Well now every 
Monday mornin’ 

When the bluebirds 
begin to sing . 

You can see John Henry 
out on the line. 

You can hear John Henry’ s 
hammer ring . 

Lawd, Lawd, you can hear 
John Henry’s hammer ring." 

John Henry stopped playing and 
sat quietly on his stool but the 
image in the silver cloud played 
on. ★

Ueath row at the state prison at 
Angola is the most democratic one 
I've been on: the inmates them- 
selves get to choose who rides and 
who stays home by a very simple 
method, and a very old one — we 
draw straws. Short straw loses. If 
he survives his run, he usually gets 
to sit out the next three or four 
draws. How many bys he gets de- 
pends on how many cons are roost- 
ing on the Row. Fewer men, fewer 
bys, naturally. 

Still, it’s a good system. Some 
joints, you get yourself on the 
guard’s list and you don’t last a 
month. He’ll keep you at it until 
you lose. 

Last drawing, I had the short 
straw. Too bad, but not unexpected; 
there were only ten of us left on the 
Row, and since I had been out of 
action for nearly three months, I was 
due. I couldn’t really complain. 

Actually, I wasn’t all that wor- 
ried. Lately we had been riding 
against Mississippi State, a bunch 
of tyro first-timers, and we were 
six-for-seven. Unless they came up 
with something better than what 
they’d been fielding, it was going to 
be a milk-run. 

Besides, the field, Brusly, was in 
our territory: we were familiar with 
it; the out-of-state boys weren’t — 
and the terrain took some getting 
used to. 

Brusly was an old river town. 
Back in ’81 or ’82 a chemical plant 
blew out and a five-kilometer 
chlorine cloud rolled into town one 



morning and wiped out two 
thousand people. The few survivors 
were evacuated shortly thereafter, 
and Brusly was officially declared a 
Ghost a few years later. Later still, 
it became a site of the “execu- 
tions.” 

So I had the advantages: home 
field and experience. But I still 
wasn’t looking forward to it. Win 
or lose, it was bad. Sometimes I 
wondered if winning wasn’t worse. 

Saturday morning, an hour before 
I was due to leave, Bent-nose, the 
guard, dropped the bad news on 
me. “It ain’t Mississippi you goin’ 
up against today,” he drawled, 
grinning. 

I was surprised. “What? Who, 
then?” 

“St. Gabriel.” 

“St. Gabriel?” I echoed, like an 
idiot. That was the women’s cage. 
“Damn!” 

Bent- nose laughed, and I swore 
again, but not for the reason he 
must have thought. A woman rider 
didn’t bother me like it did some 
guys. But St. Gabriel was tough. 
They had three aces over there. 
Worse, Brusly was closer to them 
than us, and they had used it more. 

“Who’s the driver?” I asked, try- 
ing to sound casual. 

“Now you know I ain’t sup- 
posed to tell you that!” He grinned 
bigger, enjoying my discomfort. 

“Come on, you’ve got credits 
riding on me, don’t you?” 

“Usually Ah do.” 

“But not this time?” 



WITH CLEAN HANDS 



129 




He shrugged, and that worried 
me. If Bent-nose was betting on the 
opposition, then things were bad. 
Likely I would be up against one of 
the aces. I was just shy of being an 
ace myself — but if he was betting 
on her. 

I started walking back to my cell. 

“Well, since you are riding for 
’gola. .’’he began. 

I turned back to look at him, 
knowing he just wanted to watch 
me squirm. I’d drop dead before I’d 
give the sadistic bastard the plea- 
sure. I said nothing, waiting. Fi- 
nally he knew I wasn’t going to 
ask again. 

“Kan Rela. ” 

I shrugged, as if it meant noth- 
ing, and turned away. Let him get 
his kicks somewhere else. But my 
stomach was roiling like a snake 
just beheaded. 

Kan Rela. I knew of her all right. 
First woman ace. First woman with 
ten cars. First and only woman 
double ace. I was in trouble: she 
was a killer. 

On the other hand, I wasn’t. Oh, 
sure, I had killed other riders, but 
that was different — that was self- 
defense. My original death-sentence 
was a frame, though. I hadn’t killed 
that cop-op. I knew who did, but I 
also knew it was safer to keep my 
mouth shut. Or so I had thought at 
the time. I’d been wrong, of course. 

I was a thief, and a good one. 
But not a killer. I tried to tell them 
that, but nobody wanted to hear it. 
They needed murderers. Anything 

130 



capital would do. There was no one 
else who could play the game for 
them. Oh, there were plenty of 
straights who would do it, for the 
money or for the kicks, but the law 
wouldn’t let its “honest” citizenry 
kill each other off on national 
holovision. 

But who gave a fuck about a 
condemned murderer? 

Here was good old American 
know-how, and clean hands, too: 
have the trash kill each other and 
entertain at the same time. 

We were bigger than football had 
ever been. I even got fan letters. 

Somebody must have had credits 
riding on me, though. They had fit- 
ted out the Teitaro — the best we 
had. I felt a little better. Some of 
the cars were real turtles. The Teit- 
aro was our best, both in arms and 
speed. At least I’d be even in 
machinery. 

The Teitaro, slightly bigger than 
an old three-wheeled motorcycle, is 
a standard air-cushion compact, ex- 
cept for a 5 cm. thick kleersteel 
dome, side-mounted 9mm machine 
guns and. thick body armor. It only 
had two really vulnerable spots: the 
butane tank in the belly, which is 
pretty well covered by the ground, 
and a dime-sized hole in the dome 
at the driver’s eye level. Right be- 
tween the eyes, to be exact. 

The hole is for the audience; head 
wounds bleed so nicely on color 
holovision. It makes for such dra- 
matic viewing when a con’s head 
explodes behind all that protection.

We got to Bmsly before the op- 
position, and after checking the car 
out, the crew locked me inside. 

Most straights don’t know about 
that, the locking-in part. The vid- 
eoeyes are always somewhere else 
when that happens, but the flush- 
and-invisible bolt, which can only 
be opened from the outside, is why 
we don’t just drive off into the sun- 
set. Straights think we fight because 
we’re killers, or brave, or whatever. 
Not because we have no choice. 

Inside the Teitaro, I ran through 
the instrument checks. All these 

Japanese cars were built for 

midgets; my 185 cm. frame always 
felt cramped. Both knees bumped 

the crashboard and a tight turn 

could slam an elbow into the side- 
switches, easily firing a gun acci- 
dentally. Still, it was the best we 
had and I was willing to give up 
some comfort for better handling. 
Uncomfortable-alive was better than 
comfortable-dead. 

The crew pushed me off just in- 
side the fence on the highway to 
Plaquemine, and I took off straight 
for the River Road. It paralleled the 
levee, and I was used to the area. I 
headed for Twin Trees. 

Three kilometers from the fence 
I heard the guns click as they 
armed themselves. Yeah. Within 
three kilos of the fence they were 
useless. Otherwise, there might be 
an awful lot of dead guards. 

They didn’t leave a lot to chance, 



did the warders. There was no way 
out: the fans killed automatically 
after twenty seconds over water, so 
the river was no escape and the 
fences not only cut the guns, they 
killed the fans if a car got within 
twenty meters. And they were elec- 
trically charged: even if a con did 
manage to get up enough speed to 
crash the fence, he’d be fried for 
his trouble. 

Then there were the videoeyes — 
two for each car, not to mention 
Christ knows how many robot 
guards patrolling outside the wire. 
End run at the wire and river junc- 
tion was out, too. The fence ex- 
tended into the water on pilings for 
at least a thirty-second flight. Too 
long. 

Riders didn’t run. They fought or 
the other guy killed them. Or the 
other woman. 

Twin Trees was just past the old 
power-line tower, and I figured to 
hide out in the garage of the Stone 
House and pull an ambush. 

The Stone House must have been 
built after the levee: houses which 
pre-dated it were all raised a meter 
or two for the annual spring flood. 
The Stone House, because it sat 
firmly on the ground, provided bet- 
ter cover — and it was practically 
bullet-proof. 

I didn’t know how long I’d have 
before she showed. I could hear the 
damned videoeyes buzzing over the 
garage, and I cursed them. My hope 
was that the many pecan trees in the 
back yard would obscure them 



WITH CLEAN HANDS

enough so that she wouldn’t spot 
them. There was nothing I could do 
to get rid of them. 

Once I had shot an ’eye down. 
That’s not easy to do because the 
sideguns are fixed — they don’t ele- 
vate. Looking straight ahead, the 
two streams converge on what you 
see dead-ahead at about thirty me- 
ters. Audiences like their action 
close. Anyway, I had taken my car 
up and down the side of the levee 
several times, until one of the 
cameras had gotten in front of me. 
When I started climbing again, I 
had enough angle, and I enjoyed the 
hell out of blasting it. It cost me 
two weeks in the hole, but I’d do it 
again, except that now they’re pro- 
grammed to stay out of the firing 
line. 

My air conditioner kicked off and 
on several times. Even though I was 
parked in the shade, the air was hot 
and muggy. I could smell the flow- 
ers and overgrown grasses, and I 
could hear the faint buzzing of 
insects — and videoeyes. 

Nice day to die, I thought. Sure. 

The buzzing of my videoeyes 
seemed louder suddenly, and then I 
realized why — it wasn’t just mine. I 
spotted another one passing in front 
of the open garage doorway. Then 
it stopped moving, and hovered, 
twenty-five meters up. 

I took a deep breath and hit the 
push fans hard. She must know 
where I am, I thought. And here I 
was a sitting duck, surprise gone. 

She was just off the road, and I

got by so quickly that her first burst 
missed entirely, not even close. 

She corrected with her side fans 
and began tracking me. I watched 
in the rear-viewer as the slugs 
chewed up the ground behind me, 
making a trail toward the rear of the 
Teitaro. But the car was picking up 
speed, and in a few seconds I was 
climbing the hill-like dike that was 
the Mississippi River levee. She’d 
have to chase me. 

There was no time to see. I had 
to get ready for my trick when I 
crested the top. There! I killed the 
left side fans and goosed those on 
the right. I was a good meter up, 
due to my speed, and the car did a 
quick spin. When I was at 180° 
from my sprint, I killed the other 
side fans, and leaned all my weight 
forward. The nose of the Teitaro 
pitched downward, and I was in 
perfect position to hit anything be- 
hind me. 

Only nothing was. Automatically 
I fired a quick burst before I re- 
alized that she wasn’t there. Too 
bad. 

Normally that would have been a 
good move, to tail me up the levee, 
hoping for a shot at my tank when I 
crested. The spin had put me into a 
good angle for a head-shot. I fig- 
ured that I could rattle her before 
she realized that she was in a good 
position for a head shot, too. 

Wrong. And worse, she was 
climbing parallel to me, thirty me- 
ters away. When she reached the 
top, she spun her car — a Volvo 



GALAXY 




Striker — just as I had done. Just a 
quarter-tum. Dead on my left side. 

I heard the guns chatter and felt 
the ping-ping of the slugs rattle off 
my dome. I boosted my rears fans 
to full and took off down the side 
of the levee. Not much chance of 
her doing any damage from that 
angle, but it did hurt my ego. I 
thought I’d pulled a sharp move and 
she had avoided it easily. 

Her car had slightly less speed 
than mine but a quicker turning cy- 
cle, and that should have made us 
about equal. Like knight or bishop 
in chess. 

I started behind the Stone House 
again, when my comset came on. 
She decided to talk. 

“Nice try,” she said. A nice- 
sounding voice, but hard to deter- 
mine much from it. She could have 
been twenty or fifty, beautiful or 
ugly. 

“Thanks,” I said dryly. “Not 
good enough though, was it?” 

“You’re still alive, aren’t you?” 

True. She was an ace, a double 
ace yet, and I was still breathing the 
air. That was good, unless she was 
just playing games. 

I had the house between us now, 
and I couldn’t see her. 

“Welcome to Wonderland,” I 
said. “Enjoy the rides — fun and 
games!” 

They can broadcast the com con- 
versations, but I knew from my 
own experience watching the HV 
on the Row that they seldom do. 
Tape-delay of six seconds is too 



slow to keep up with the action, if 
there is any, and live ’casts are out 
of the question. 

You never knew what some crazy 
con might say — especially if he 
knew that 300 million people might 
hear it on live holovision. They’d 
monitor, but they wouldn’t send it 
out. 

“I don’t suppose you’d like to 
quit and call it a draw?” I said. 

“Love to — but. ...” 

“Sure. Try it, and they zap us 
both. Just a thought.” I’d wondered 
before just what they would do if 
both contestants refused to fight. I 
wasn’t that interested in finding out. 
This way, I had a chance. 

She stopped talking, and I de- 
cided it was a good time to move. 
Keeping the house between me and 
the levee, I backed off toward the 
pecan trees. 

She must have climbed the levee 
again to get up speed, because 
when she flew by the house, she 
must have been hitting sixty-five — 
sideways, no less. Her chances of 
snuffing me at that speed were slim, 
but it was impressive. 

I had the advantage. I was set in 
the trees, and I tracked her. I even 
managed to bounce a couple of 
rounds off her car. No damage, but 
I felt a hell of a lot better. At least 
she wasn’t unhittable. 

I’d never have caught her so I did- 
n’t try; she had too much speed 
going. When she was nearly a 
kilometer away, into the cow pas- 
ture, I called. 



WITH CLEAN HANDS 



133 




“Not bad,” I said, trying to 
sound unafraid. 

“Thanks. That was pretty good 
shooting.” 

“Um.” 

“Now that we know we can both 
drive,” she said, “shall we get 
down to it?” She sounded calm; it 
made me nervous. I punched in the 
rear fans and headed back to the 
levee. There was a flat side on the 
river bank that had a lot of trees 
and bushes for cover. Even a few 
small ponds. 

“Where’d you go?” she asked. 
Her voice sounded very distant. 
Must be at nearly the two-kilometer 
limit of the comset, I thought. 
Good. That would give me plenty 
of time to find a place to get set. 
The videoeyes wouldn’t be specific 
enough to give me away in all that 
brush, I thought. I wondered why I 
hadn’t done that in the first place. 
On the other hand, if I were a genius, 
I wouldn’t have been there. 

“I’m around,” I said. “Don’t 
worry.” 

“Who, me?” she said faintly. 

Still off in the distance, I 
thought. 

Wrong. She came over the levee 
like a bomb, almost on top of me. 
Damn! How could she get here that 
fast? 

Because she was here all along, 
stupid, said a voice inside my head. 
Didn’t you ever think of lowering 
your voice to make it seem like you 
were far away? No, come to think 
of it, I hadn’t. 



Crap. I was outclassed, pure and 
simple, and she had me dancing 
seven ways to somewhere. 

The angle was not good enough 
for either of us to shoot, and she 
tore by so close that I could have 
almost touched her. 

A flash of a look: young, maybe 
thirty — my age. Brown hair, cut 
short. Not a pretty face, but hand- 
some in its own way. And grim. 
And scared. Amazing how much 
you can see in a brief instant. 

I got tangled up in my controls, 
and my spin was too slow to track 
her. I almost killed my left side fan, 
but I finally managed to get the 
Teitaro around, cursing all the 
while. 

She was over the water, swinging 
in a wide tum. Crazy! I started 
counting. 

It was going to be close. At sev- 
enteen, she was still off-shore. She 
passed out of my line of sight be- 
hind the trees at nineteen. If she hit 
the water, she’d sink like a rock, 
and she’d drown quickly. The cars 
were not water-tight, and even if 
they were, there’d be nobody who’d 
come to pull her out. 

But she made it. The comset 
blared a good ten seconds after she 
should have been in the water. 

“You still there, Del?” 

So she knew my name. “Still 
here, Kan Rela.” 

For some insane reason, I was 
glad she hadn’t gone down. That 
didn’t make any sense, but I was 
glad anyway.

“You’re not too bright, playing 
over the river like that!” 

“What else could I do? I’d have 
been boxed between the trees 
otherwise. You’d have creamed 
me.” 

I was glad she couldn’t see my 
face. With the clumsiness of my 
turn, I hadn’t had a prayer of touch- 
ing her. I was glad she didn’t know 
that. At least she was giving me 
credit for being dangerous. Of 
course that meant that she wouldn’t 
do anything reckless. A shame. 
“Del?” 

“Yeah.” 

“You’ve killed five, right?” 
“Yeah.” 

“That’s not counting the one they 
sent you up for?” 

“A frame.” 

A pause. Then, “Really?” 

“Yeah. Why should I lie? One of 
us is going to be dead soon; what 
difference does it make?’ ’ 

“That’s too bad,” she said 
quietly. 

I didn’t know if she was sorry 
that one of us was going to be 
dead, or that I’d been framed. 
Maybe both. 

“And you?” I asked. 

“He was my husband.” 

I said nothing, waiting. 

“He was beating me, and I 
fought back. He hit his head.” 

“I’m sorry.” 

“Don’t be. It was eight years 
ago. I’ve gotten over it.” 

Eight years! Christ, what was it 
like to be on Death Row for eight 



years? I was only a two-year man, 
and I felt like I was older than the 
world sometimes. Eight years! I felt 
sorry for her. And myself. 

I had the fans on low so that I 
could creep around the bushes with- 
out stirring up too much dirt. I 
nosed around a large shrub, and 
there she was, broadside to my 
guns and unaware of me. 

I opened up with both guns. It 
was not a good angle. I needed a 
rear shot or head shot to do any real 
destruction. But the ground was 
probably too soft to bounce any 
slugs into her tank from the rear, 
and she was too good for me to 
chance head-to-head. I saw the trac- 
ers, every tenth round, spark off her 
clear dome. But only for a second. 
She jerked her eyes around to look 
at me, and then she was gone. 

Now or never, I thought. I swung 
the car out and followed her into the 
brush. I planned to latch onto her 
tail and stay there until 1 could get 
her. 

It was a mistake. She wasn’t 
there. I looked frantically around, 
and soon found where she’d gone. 

She was on my tail! 

Bad news. The sweat was pour- 
ing off me, off the air conditioner. 
Somebody as good — no, better — then 
me was on me, and I knew I 
couldn’t shake her. I had a sudden 
flash of realization. She was going 
to beat me. I was going to die. 

I could hear her bullets hammer- 
ing on the back of my car, but I 
couldn’t think of anything to do 



WITH CLEAN HANDS

about it. I don’t remember the ac- 
tual motions; my mind was a blank. 

I must have slammed all my. fans 
into reverse. There was a screech of 
protesting metal, a shredding sound 
of plastic, a jolt that slammed me 
into the crashboard and bounced my 
head off the kleersteel dome, and I 
stopped. Cold. 

She wasn’t expecting it. She tried 
to swerve and almost made it, she 
was that good. But the left edge of 
the Volvo caught the back of the 
Teitaro, and the force was enough 
to roll her completely — minus all 
the fan ducts on her left side. 

I watched the whole thing in 
slow-motion, as if time had ceased 
to flow normally and had stretched 
out like taffy. She completed the 
roll, landed heavily against an oak 
tree. I saw her head jolted around. 
She must have been frantically 
working the controls, but she was 
getting no response. The Volvo 
wasn’t going anywhere. 

The Teitaro was damaged badly 
as well, but I still had a few fans 
working — I could move. Slowly I 
came to bear on the exposed under- 
side of her car, jammed hopelessly 
against the tree. I had her, and there 
was nothing she could do about it, 
nothing. Good-bye, lady-ace. 

I felt no joy, however. I hadn’t 
really beaten her with skill, only 
luck and mindless desperation. And 
she wasn’t really my enemy — she 
was as much a pawn as I was, an 
innocent victim. I couldn’t even 
rationalize that she was a murderer. 

136 



Killing her would only please my 
real enemies — the good people who 
had put us both here for their enter- 
tainment. The ones who were enjoy- 
ing every minute of this, glued to 
holovisions across the country. 

I could see her face, ten meters 
away, pale and defeated and look- 
ing at me. 

“Congratulations,” she said 
through the comset. “You win. 
Good-bye.” And then she waved 
and closed her eyes and bowed her 
head. 

Son-of-a-bitch! No! It was too 
much! I nursed the failing fans, 
pushing the car forward, to the 
other side. Good, the tree wasn’t 
blocking my target! 

She looked up, puzzled. 

I began firing, swinging the front 
of my car back and forth in order 
to get hits from both sideguns. Too 
low. I backed the car up and tried 
again. Ah, better. 

“What are you doing?” she said 
“Are you crazy? You can’t hurt 
anything that way! There’s nothing 
on that side, except. .” 

I grinned, knowing she could see 
me.

P ertinent questions in reference 



to J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Sil- 
marillion: 

Did you like it? 

I loved it. 

Is it as good as Lord of the 
Rings? 

That’s hard to answer flatly. I 
have read LotR twice, and lived 
with the memory of it for twenty 
years; while I have only just 
finished The Silmarillion. There is 
so much in it that should be taken 
into account in making an 
evaluation, and 1 am not a Tolkien 
scholar. But my very subjective 
impression is that it is better. 

Both times 1 read LotR I had to 
push myself along to get through 
the first two books. I found a lot of

GALAXY 



it tedious. But I was never bored 
with The Silmarillion for a minute. 
It has so much charm and 
excitement; imagination and in- 
vention. 

However, it is different than Lot- 
R. A narration rather than a drama- 
tic narrative. It is not a novel, but a 
mythology. A long series of closely 
connected tales that form a history 
of the world from its beginnings. I 
can imagine some people being put 
off by this, bored, or disappointed. 
I found it delightful. 

What is it about? 

Three hundred and four pages, 
not counting the addenda. 

There are five separate, but re- 
lated, narratives. The first is the 
“Ainulindale,” which recounts the 
story of the creation, not simply of 
the world, but of the three great 
“themes” that are to compose the 
scheme of things in times to come. 

The second is the “ Valaquenta. ” 
The theogony. Who’s Who among 
the gods. 

The third is the “Quenta 
Silmarillion,” the epic story of the 
origin of the Elves, Dwarves, and 
what not, and how they left the pro- 
tection of the Valar for Middle- 
Earth. Of how the god (more 
accurately, angel) Melkor fell into 
his evil ways to become the 
accursed Morgoth. His plans for 
conquest, his victories, his 
inevitable defeat. Of the Elvish 
heroes who were born to battle 
against him. The legendary cities 
they championed that fell before 



him one by one. Of the 
reconciliation of Elves and Valar. 
Of the passing of their reign and the 
rise of Men. 

The fourth is the “Akallabeth.” 
The fall of the mighty land of 
Numenor to the wily cunning of 
Sauron. 

And finally, “Of the Rings of 
Power and the Third Age,” which 
is an attempt to synthesize the 
whole epic from beginning to the 
end of LotR and beyond. 

There are very useful appendices 
to help the reader keep track of who 
is who and doing what; plus some 
excellent maps. I might recommend 
the reader look at the “Note on 
Pronunciation” before getting too 
far into the book, to help him 
pronounce the names correctly. 
There are hundreds of them, all 
mellifluous. 

Do you have any favorites among 
the tales? 

The story of Beren and Luthien. 
Charming. The story of Tuor and 
his fight with the dragon. And 
Sauron’s conquest of Numenor. 
Very spectacular. But I loved it all. 
A thoroughly entertaining book. 

Any further comments? 

I expect so much will be written 
about this book in years to come by 
fen who have studied it conscien- 
tiously that it seems futile for me to 
say anything more, but the curious 
thing about it is that, despite all the 
pleasure it gave to me, it has made 
me think less of Tolkien than I did 
before.

He was neither a genius nor an 
original. 

It is not that he was not a good 
writer. His prose is fine. But he is 
imitating pre-Christian literature with 
the intellect and imagination of a 
middle-class Victorian, and what is 
most poignant, most dramatic, and 
most profound in the former is 
utterly lacking in the latter. 

The stories and themes of such as 
Beowulf and The Wanderer were 
derived from folk tales and reflected 
a universal spiritual point of view. 
Life was a terrible thing. Man was 
cursed with the impermanence of 
existence. Age was to be feared as 
much as any disease. Freedom was 
out of the question. Without his 
tribe or clan, a man was doomed. 
War was a way of life. Glory, an 
illusion. It was better that a man 
had never been born. 

These were not the sentiments of 
a group of fashionably pessimistic 
writers catering to the neurotic 
tastes of their age. They are to be 
found everywhere in western 
literature and song for thousands of 
years. 

And the same is true of fairy 
tales. The best deal with very 
fundamental concepts, such as hope 
and fear, with an almost childlike 
simplicity of technique. But none of 
this is true of Tolkien. 

The reader is always aware of the 
high quality of the mind behind the 
invention. Not that Tolkien is given 
to Vonnegut-like cleverness, but 
neither is he capable of transcending 



his conventional 19th-century view 
of society to depict the universal 
human condition. 

His characters are never more 
than human. Their motivations 
never more than familiar. Nor do 
his characters embody their 
motivations. It is not what Tolkien 
tells, or fails to tell, us about them 
that makes them less than 
archetypal; it is what they are — little 
Englishmen. And nothing more. 

To the majority of people who 
read the Odyssey today, the fact that 
Odysseus is a Greek is of minor 
importance. Homer convinces us 
that he is Man. Or rather, an aspect 
of Man struggling against a hostile 
world. And the same is true of the 
monster Grendel. The embodiment 
of menace and malice. Everyman’s 
bogeyman. But this is not true of 
Frodo or Feanor or the Gollum or 
Sauron. At best, they are a 
Dickensian variety. 

This is not to say that they are 
not pleasant characters to read 
about, or that Tolkien does not tell 
a wonderful story, but it is not more 
than a wonderful story. The essence 
of the greatness of the material is 
missing; those elements of the tragic 
and the terrible and the sensual that 
make the originals so potent a 
literature. 

I cannot accuse him of 
“cuteness” as some have. His 
treatment of the elves and hobbits is 
affectionate rather than sentimental, 
but there is the element of 
“niceness,” of gentility, in them 



140 



GALAXY 




all, even in the likes of Morgoth, 
that undermines their fairy-tale 
credibility. For all the pages of talk 
of the unmentionable evils to be 
found in the dungeons of Morgoth 
and Sauron, one knows there are 
things neither would stoop to. For 
instance — well, use your own 
imagination. Think of something 
evil. Then try to imagine it in 
Mordor. 

The closest Tolkien comes to an 
unmentionable is in the story of 
Turin and his love for Niniel. He 
has found her wandering in the 
woods, suffering from complete 
amnesia. He marries her, not 
knowing she is his sister. 
Eventually, they find out. They kill 
themselves. But whereas a 
Sophocles would have accompanied 
their fate with horrendous wailing 
and horror, Tolkien manages it with 
a stiffer-upper-lip decorum that 1 am 
confident no PTA will ever deny to 
school library shelves. 

The cardinal sin in Tolkien’s 
world, as in every other 
mythological invention, is Pride. 
But where in a Milton it is seen as 
a flaw of heroic dimensions that 
drives man to the madness of 
challenging the throne of Heaven, 
in Tolkien it is simply a kind of 
bad manners. 

The sin of pride, to an 
Englishman, is a sin against one’s 
class. It is the asserting of one’s 
individual aspirations and ambitions 
over and against the collective 
order. An order, the English are 



WE’RE

Association (£) 



firmly convinced, ordained, and 
sustained, by God himself. This is 
the sin of Morgoth. Not to be God, 
but to rule as himself over his own 
creation, his own order. 

Naturally, he fails. In fact, he 
never had a chance of succeeding, 
for all his power, for the order of 
the world (the universe itself) is the 
will of God, absolute and 
immutable; and by failing to 
perceive this, or refusing to accept 
it, he defines himself as either a 
fool or a madman. Absolute 
creation is in the hands of God; a 
Morgoth can only corrupt what 
already exists. 

Feanor, the greatest of the Elves, 
like many a hero, falls into the 
same trap. He refuses to hand over 



141 





his finest creation, the Silmarills, to 
the Valar for the welfare of the 
community. He refuses to accept his 
class’s subordination to that of the 
aristocratic, angel-like Valar and 
takes them into exile where he 
immediately commits a peasant-like 
crime and is cursed. 

Although the class structure is the 
same in the hierarchy of the gods, 
where Tolkien’s differs is in their 
school-masterish rationality. An 
Apollo would have smashed a 
Feanor to elvish mush for so much 
as giving him a dirty look, and 
repented his hastiness at leisure, but 
never a Valar. They are always 
good as they are always just. 

None of which is to be 
interpreted as an expression of my 
own prejudices against the English, 
of which 1 have none. 1 love the 
English. And I still love Tolkien. 
But The Silmarillion, like LotR, is 
to be seen for what it is: an English 
fairy tale- about Englishmen. And 
nothing more. 

Theodore Sturgeon: 90% of 
science fiction is crap. 

Fact: Theodore Sturgeon 

writes science fiction. 

Conclusion: 90% of Theodore 
Sturgeon’s science fiction is 
crap. 

Two of the most interesting 
stories in The Worlds of Theodore 
Sturgeon concern young men who 
are highly talented, sensitive, and 
loving, but who are unable to suc- 



ceed in the mundane world because 
of their neurotic personalities. After 
reading the nine stories in this in- 
ferior collection, I am inclined to 
think Sturgeon had himself in mind 
when he created them. 

Everything that made Sturgeon 
one of the most influential sf writers 
of the late forties and fifties is 
here — the genuinely interesting 
mind, the sensitivity and compas- 
sion, the instinct for drama, the 
gentle humor, and the sense of the 
need for a careful balance between 
the human and scientific elements in 
an sf story. Yet for all the talent on 
display, not one of these stories is 
what it could have been. 

In story after story, idea and 
emotion, drama and theme are 
buried under sloppy sentimentality, 
crude over- writing, and its related 
ill, diarrhea of the dialogue. All 
lack discipline — patience — that extra 
careful draft that would have been 
necessary to refine their difficult fic- 
tional elements. For what Sturgeon 
was trying to do was difficult in- 
deed: to humanize the tradition of 
pulp science fiction without losing 
the tradition altogether. To relate 
the scientific and human elements 
of the story in such a way as to re- 
alize both of them dramatically. 
And to write science fiction as if it 
were poetry, a blend of vision and 
feeling; something that left the read- 
er moved as much by one as by 
the other. 

Simak is the one writer who 
comes to mind who accomplished 



142 



GALAXY 




this in Sturgeon’s time, but since 
then it has become the main direc- 
tion of almost all good science fic- 
tion. But where Simak, at his best, 
is careful. Sturgeon gives the im- 
pression that having the ideas in 
mind, he just sat down and wrote. 

Frankly, I found most of these 
stories rather boring to re-read, but 
not entirely. That special Sturgeon 
quality still exerts its power through 
all the verbiage. But technically he 
seems most successful when he is 
most mischievious, as in “Shottle 
Bop,” or “The Sky was Full of 
Ships.” And to an extent in “The 
Perfect Host,” which is really so 
old-fashioned I am embarrassed to 
admit I enjoyed it. I suspect it is the 
kind of story that sf writers can’t 
get away with anymore. The kind 
written straight off the top of the 
head in the wee hours of the morn- 
ing when the writer is smashed out 
of his skull. 

He is least successful here at his 
most interesting efforts, such as 
“The Graveyard Reader,” which is 
sentimental and predictable, or in 
“The Other Man” and “Maturity,” 
which are hideously crude and naive 
and sentimental and half-a-dozen 
other things, but interesting all the 
same. 

Then there are a few antiques, 
such as “Memorial” and “The 
Skills of the Xanadu,” which were 
not worth reprinting. In fact, it is 
curious that this book was reprinted. 
No one I spoke to at Ace knew who 
had selected the stories back in

blessing as a survey of his work 
from 1946 to 1962. What a shame 
if anyone believed that. Sturgeon 
has done better. 

Your money would be better 
spent on E Pluribus Unicorn or

to mention More Than Human. All 
are uneven, but all have a few 
stories that are better than any of

Wearisome wizards and ho-hum 
homunculi 

On the front cover of Mark S. 
Geston’s The Siege of Wonder, just 
above the absolutely delightful illo 
by H.R. Van Dongen, Gerald Jonas 
of the Times is quoted as saying, “I 
liked this book very much,” which 
puzzles me, because I did not like 
the book at all. I don’t doubt Jonas’ 
word; but that he liked it and I 
found it so cold and unentertaining 
makes me wonder if it was just a 
case of this not being my sort of 
book. 

Years ago, I was impressed by 
Geston’s first novel, Lords of the 
Starship, and the memory was re- 
vived by this one. The strangeness, 
the atmosphere, the ambiguity of 
the ending. All here. But none of 
the wonder, the mystery. 

The Siege of Wonder is about the 
final days of a war between the 



forces of magic and those of science 
that has lasted seven hundred years. 
It seems to divide into three parts: 
the mission of Aden, an agent of 
the powerful Special Office, to im- 
plant a spying device in the eye of a 
unicorn; his return and affair with a 
magical maiden named Gedwyn; 
and the bi-lateral expedition of 
Aden and two Border Command 
scientists to the Holy City after the 
Wizards have been mysteriously 
vanquished by their own power. 

The first is a sort of Mission: Im- 
possible situation, which, like every- 
thing else in the book, just — 
happens. We are introduced to a not 
very interesting or personable hero 
who does his job with bland effi- 
cency, and then goes away. There 
is a fleeting moment of suspense in 
the church when his cohort implants 
the device, but as Geston disdains 
melodrama, it is gone as quickly as 
it came. 

Aden then must travel hundreds 
of miles to get back to his own 
lines, but aside from once being 
watched momentarily by two 
masked men, it is a humdrum jour- 
ney. He meets a beautiful girl with 
magical powers with whom he has an 
idyllic affair that for another fleet- 
ing moment made the book live. 
But then he and the moment go 
away again. 

At that point I lost patience and 
never again really gave a damn, or 
was encouraged to care, what the 
rest of the book was about. Aden 
gets home, is debriefed, and recup- 



144 



GALAXY 




erates. Two new characters, as face- 
less and uninteresting as he, have 
what little dialogue there is in the 
book, discussing the war. Then it is 
discovered the wizards have mys- 
teriously vanished. Aden sets out 
again to find Gedwyn and see the 
Holy City. The two scientist/ 
soldiers go to see what has hap- 
pened. 

Had Geston brought it off, the 
remaining half of the book would 
have been a field day for all con- 
cerned, for he obviously gave a lot 
of thought to the scenes he de- 
scribes of a land of magic in which 
the magic has died and the won- 
drous creatures that survive go pain- 
fully to their deaths. As it is, Ges- 
ton seems so terrified of writing a 
single line of purple prose that ev- 
erything is told, more often than 
shown, with a kind of grim matter- 
of-factness. A style that I found as 
hard to penetrate as any I have ever 
read. 

As there are no characters to care 
about, so there is no conflict to get 
excited about. Things happen in 
series rather than in sequence. One 
is never sure until the end whom Ges- 
ton is rooting for. Both sides appear 
equally unpleasant socially and 
politically. Most likely it is all a 
metaphor for the war between sci- 
ence and art, or intellect and imagi- 
nation, or some such thing, but it is 
so abstract as to be irrelevant to my 
knowledge of this conflict. Geston’s 
scientists are no more credible than 
his wizards. 



All of this might have been for- 
givable if only Geston’s wonders 
were wondrous. But they are not. 
Wizards, gryphons, fairy princesses, 
floating cities, etc., etc. It is simply 
not enough to say, “The Grand 
Wizard strode down the boulevard 
accompanied by his dragon, 
Lucille.” One must see the grand- 
ness of the wizard and the fierce- 
someness of the dragon. Stated 
matter-of-factly, it means less than 
nothing. 

Geston had the talent and the 
brains and the ability. He simply 
chose to write another kind of book. 
One that did not appeal to me at all. 
It did appeal to Jonas though, so 
perhaps there are other people out 
there who will find more in The 
Siege of Wonder than I did. If so, I 
would be curious to know what. 



Porkbarrel Prose 

How many “How to Write” 
books have I read over the past 
twenty years? A dozen? Two doz- 
en? How many of them were really 
worthwhile? One? Two? One I 
would swear by; another I would 
recommend as supplementary read- 
ing. The rest were all, “Well, you 
know, the way I do it is. .” 
Such books and articles depress me, 
but whether for the readers or the 
writers I am not sure. 

There are three kinds of “How to 
Write” books. First, texts — with di- 
agrams and exercises, most of 



145 




which only demonstrate how hard it 
is to explain the obvious. Second, 
advice books — filled with “tips.” 
And, third, anecdotal autobio- 
graphical accounts of a particular 
writer’s career masquerading as a 
text. Some of these are good. I 
especially recommend Patricia 
Highsmith’s Plotting and Writing 
Suspense Fiction. It will teach you 
nothing about plotting or writing but 
it will tell you all sorts of things 
about the wonderful mind of a 
talented novelist. 

Writing and Selling Science Fic- 
tion by “The Science Fiction Writ- 
ers of America” is an advice book. 
There are eleven essays by the likes 
of Poul Anderson, Jerry Poumelle, 
Kate Wilhelm, James Gunn, George 
R.R. Martin and andy offutt. As 
such books go, it isn’t bad. The 
Anderson piece on “Nomenclature 
in Science Fiction” is a delight. 
Poumelle on building future worlds 
is interesting. Wilhelm on charac- 
terization is accurate and succinct. 
In fact, just about everybody is 
mercifully concise and nobody 
makes a jackass of him/herself. 

C.L. Grant writes an intelligent 
and useful introduction and andy 
offutt gleefully teels us how to sock 
it to the IRS . The rest of the articles 
were largely redundant. 

If you know anything about writ- 
ing, the book is not going to tell 
you anything you do not already 
know. If you know little or nothing 
about it, it is not going hurt you. 
But novices should be warned to 



approach such books with caution. 
Their usefulness is less in the ad- 
vice they impart (which could as 
easily be found in a writer’s 
magazine) than in the attitudes they 
encourage. Professionals take a lot 
for granted. Writing is a skill that is 
more absorbed than learned, and 
ideas that seem simple common- 
sense to the sf writer are often dif- 
ficult concepts for anyone else to 
grasp. The reason is that they can- 
not take into account the factor of 
their talent. 

Consequently, a Kate Wilhelm 
can make the very high art of char- 
acterization seem child’s play: 
“You just sit down and ask 
yourself — ” 

Professionals have a better idea 
of the attitudes involved in their 
success but these attitudes are still 
generally vague. They cannot be 
truly explained. They have to be 
understood by exposure — by listen- 
ing in on professional minds at 
work, for example — and a casual 
reading of a book like this will not 
give it to the novice. He has to first 
empty his mind of chicken fat and 
then meditate upon what he is ab- 
sorbing. 

Unfortunately there is much 
chicken fat in these essays. We 
should have a right to expect better 
from the SFWA. But what there is 
of sane and sensible attitudes here 
should be of some use. I would not 
recommend this book but I would 
not discourage anyone from it 
either. ★

Okay, Geis. What did ol’ J.J.P. 
say when he called? And how come 
he didn’t ask for me? 

“Well, Alter, he spoke as if you 
were a mere literary device, a sim- 
ple figment of my imagination. He 
had no idea that dealing with you 
and your tantrums would eventually 
drive him into another editorial po- 
sition just as it drove Jim Baen to 
Ace Books.” 

I am not difficult to work with, 
as you should know, Geis. I am the 
soul of reasonableness, the zenith of 
cooperation, the apex of . of — 

“Bitchiness.” 

Bitchi — Listen, stop denigrating 
me. You’ll give the new editor of 
GALAXY a wrong — 

“Right!” 

THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT 



— impression of me. Now, what 
did J.J. Pierce have to say? 

“Oh, the general new-editor hope 
for improvement and desire to do 
the best he could. Also, he said he 
wanted the column as long as we 
were willing to write it.” 

He did? Very shrewd man. I will 
not disappoint him. Even though I 
am running rather short of ideas for 
the column. 

“Why don’t you appeal to the 
readers for help, Alter? Suggest 
they send in topics they’d like you 
and me to discuss. Have them send 
in direct questions.” 

I have a column for this time 
but . say, I’ll ask my thousands 
of readers to send in suggestions for 
future columns and to ask questions 

147 



they’d like me to answer. 

“Alter!” 

Yeah . that’ll bring in feed- 
back, give everybody a sense of 
participation and make my work 
easier. What do you think Geis? 

“I think ... I think—” 

I knew you’d approve. So that’s 
what I’ll do. Readers out there! 
You! Stop picking your nose and 
stop half-thinking about that 
stacked/hung girl-boy next door! If 
there’s some topic or idea or aspect 
of sf you’d like Geis and me to 
argue about, send it in. Got a ques- 
tion you’d like answered about him 
or me? Send it in. Send it to Geis 
& Alter, P. O. Box 11408, Port- 
land, Oregon 97211. 

“We’ll be lucky to get three let- 
ters, Alter. And the suggestions will 
likely be obscene and anatomically 
impossible.” 

For you, Geis, but not for me. I 
enjoy it. 

“Not with my body, you don’t!” 

Don’t be a sorehead. 

“It’s not my head that’ll be 
sore!” 

Nevertheless, the invitation to the 
readers is genuine. Let’s see what 
happens. 

* Grump* *M utter* 

Now, onward to the body of this 
column, I’d like to talk about sci- 
ence fiction for — 

“For a change?” 

— openings. 

“Get your mind off of sex. Al- 
ter.” 

Geis! Will you stop hectoring 

148 



me? Just stop it! Lay off now. I’ve 
got something important to say. 

“That’ll be the day. What could 
you have in that tendrilled head that 
could be important? 

Listen, and be convinced of my 
superiority. Now I’ve watched you 
begin reading a new sf novel or a 
story, read a couple of paragraphs, 
become bemused, distracted, irri- 
tated, angered, enraged, furious, 
apoplectic, and finally throw the 
book or magazine across the room 
while shouting a vile oath, an im- 
precation even. 

“Yes . that happens all too of- 
ten. I find the technique of most sf 
writers to be so abysmal — especially 
the elementary technique involved 
in opening lines and paragraphs — 
that I turn into a cursing monster.” 

Exactly. Your self-control — 

“And I’ve seen you do it too, Al- 
ter. First your eyes glint, then you 
mutter alien words under your 
breath, then your tendrils stiffen and 
turn pink, deepening in color to 
livid crimson. Finally, eyes glitter- 
ing, you tense and your right arm 
shoots forward with the book or 
magazine and the offending publica- 
tion rockets through the air to either 
hit the wall or impact in the wood- 
box next to the stove, where I have 
to salvage it for future reference. 

All right, let’s get to the meat of 
what I’m trying to say. While I was 
rummaging around in your memory 
cells, I came across a lot of recall 
from books and magazines devoted 
to fiction writing and magazines 



GALAXY 




you’d read in your youth. “How to 
Write Fiction.” “How to Grab 
Readers,” “The Critical First Para- 
graph.” Things like that. You read 
years of writer’s digest, all Jack 
Woodford’s books on writing and — 

“They made an indelible impres- 
sion, Alter, and by applying that 
knowledge, 1 managed to sell my 
first serious commercial story to 
adam in 1959 and about a hundred 
others in the following few years, 
while starting to write novels in 
nineteen sixty. Sold my first 
eighty-nine novels with only three 
or four rejections along the way.” 

Stop bragging. I’m trying to 
make point. The point is that the 
first two or three paragraphs of a 
story are crucial. The point is that a 
reader will stick with a writer that 
long, but damn few any longer 
without being intrigued or hooked 
by some fiction dynamic death, 
danger, sex, power, money. We’ve 
seen people browsing at news- 
stands. A cover or a title or a writ- 
er’s name will impel a reader to 
pick the book or magazine off the 
rack for further investigation. The 
reader will read for a few seconds 
here and there . and a few 
people will even read the last page 
before deciding whether to purchase 
or not. 

“Alter, I view people who read 
the endings of stories before reading 
the entire story as creatures benight- 
ed by fate, a breed of mental 
masochists, a perverted variety 
of — ” 



Oh, shut up, Geis! What I want 
to do here is to underline the impor- 
tance of making the reader want to 
read the next line. From the first 
line to the last line. And I’ll present 
some good and bad examples of 
opening sequences of current 
novels. 

“Alter, your concern for your fel- 
low sf writers is marvelous. I’m 
sure they’ll thank you for giving 
them lessons in public and for 
pointing out their flaws, faults and 
failings. They’ll pat you on the 
head with blunt instruments!” 

Nevertheless, Geis, I will persist 
in my crusade to improve the lot of 
the sf reader. Let me begin. I am 
going to quote the first paragraph of 
an sf novel published in nineteen 
seventy-seven: then I will have a 
comment and then I will identify it 
and its writer. Okay? 

“No!” 

Fine. Here is the quote: 

Moving faster than the dawn, 
the shuttle from the orbiting 
cruiser Realta might have been 
seen, by the sharpest of those 
eyes that watched from the land- 
ing station, as a flash of light, 
preceding, by just a few seconds, 
the first brilliance of Sigma-G53 
as it began to rise above the 
eastern horizon. With the new 
day came the wind; an unobtru- 
sive breeze at first, it rose, as the 
sun climbed higher, into a biting 
gale that flung the countryside 



THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT 



149 




into a frenzy of unwelcomed ac- 
tivity. It shook the tiny landing 
station with its human and native 
occupants, until both man and 
alien looked to each other for 
moral comfort and a reassurance 
that they would not at any mo- 
ment be flung across the 
hills — with concrete base, wind- 
proofed towers and docked ships 
following in a turmoil of destruc- 
tive energy. 

Doesn’t that opening paragraph 
with its dense, ill-structured sen- 
tences, malaprop metaphor and 
dumb content — doesn’t it make you 
itchy to read on? I especially liked 
where human and alien looked to 
each other for moral support. 
Where’s the morality of anything 
involved? The author wanted to say 
that a very strong wind usually ac- 
companied sunrise on this alien 
planet and it made people and na- 
tives wonder if they’d survive. But 
they obviously had survived, for 
generations. And the space station 
too, for decades or more. What we 
have is author overkill, ineptitude 
and careless thinking. 

I never did get past the third para- 
graph. The author had demonstrated 
he was a klutz at fiction and noth- 
ing indicated any compensating ta- 
lent for dialogue or characterization 
or sense of wonder. It would have 
been a very dreary read so — 

“You threw it across the room, 
eh, Alter?” 

Right. For those who may want 
150 



to know who and what, the quote is 
from Eye Among the Blind by 
Robert P. Holdstock. (Doubleday, 
$6.95.) 

“Are you now going to give us 
an example of a very good opening 
for an sf novel?” 

Of course. But fine opening 
paragraphs are preferred for any 
story of any type, of any genre. For 
a good one, all you have to do is 
reach for the nearest Ron Goulart 
book. Thus, in his recent The Em- 
peror of the Last Days (Popular Li- 
brary, $1.50, 1977.) we have: 

The man plummeted, straight 
down past Dan Farleigh’s only 
window. 

“Hey!” Dan had been chat- 
ting with his central computer. 
He only got a flashing impres- 
sion of the silently screaming 
man out of the comer of his eye. 

“Only some guy doing the 
Dutch,” said the computer’s 
voice box. “Nothing to — ” 

“He must have jumped from 
some office directly above this 
one.” Dan was running toward 
the oval plexiwindow. 

Police aircruisers were already 
hooting someplace below when 
the long lanky young man got 
across the huge, high and hollow 
Fax-Central Office to take a look 
out. 

“I can see him sprawled on a 
pedramp at about level thirty- 
two,” said Dan, craning his neck 
and pressing his forehead against 



GALAXY 




the soft, tinted window. The 
walkramps and towering build- 
ings of Manhattan made multicol- 
ored zigzag patterns across the 
morning .... 

Needless to say, Geis, that open- 
ing line got me and the swift, 
information-laden sentences that fol- 
lowed drew me along, painting a 
picture of the city, the technology, 
the central character. Bloody mar- 
velous, Goulart’s technical skill is 
incredible. 

“But, Alter, he never seems to 
apply this virtuosity to a heavy, 
serious, important novel. All he 
deals in is formula with a dash — 
sometimes a flagon — of satire.” 
That’s his affair, Geis. We are 
not here to critique successful writ- 
ers’ careers and choices of material. 
I will now use an opening quote 
from a long-time sf writer whose 
name will carry his readers through 
a dull sequence — because they trust 
him. The quote: 

Five of them were seated 
about the central table of the rec- 
reation room. In name it was 
the recreation hall , but it just 
wasn’t as big as all that. Bring 
up a dozen visiting firemen, plus 
the three-man crew of the 
spacecraft, and the place was 
packed. However, it was a 
reasonably charming room, made 
livable with paintings and other 
art, complete with comfortable 
furniture, a well-stocked bar, Tri 



di television, and of all things, a 
ping-pong table. Ping-pong took 
a bit of getting used to in these 
parts; for that matter, even a card 
game could take some getting 
used to. 

They were, reading from left 
to right, Mary Lou Pickett, 
American; Kingsley Brett-James, 
Englishman; Max Zimmerman, 
Israeli; Li Ching, Chinese; and 
Azikiwe Awolowo, Nigerian. 
They spoke to each other in Es- 
peranto, for policy reasons, 
though all knew English, and 
each of them liked each of the 
others as much as they had ever 
liked anyone. They had to; it 
was a matter of survival. 

They were playing Liar’s 
Dice, once-favorite of the Royal 
Air Force when the chips were 
down during the Battle of Bri- 
tain. 

Max Zimmerman shook the 
dice cup with a flourish, banged 
it down on the table and peered 
beneath the edge, hiding the cup 
from his neighbors with his other 
hand. Smiling broadly, he an- 
nounced. “Three aces,” and 
passed the cup to Li Ching. 

The only hint of possible poten- 
tial trouble/suspense is in that busi- 
ness of having to like their com- 
panions because it was a matter of 
survival. 

“I agree. Alter. This is a low- 
grade opening sequence, the mark 
of a lazy writer who want to in- 



THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT 



151 




dulge in name-listing and setting the 
stage before getting down to busi- 
ness. Who is the writer? 

That quote was from Space Vis- 
itor by Mack Reynolds. (Ace, 
$1.50, 1977.) It shows he is taking 
his readers somewhat for granted. 

“I would hardly have believed it of 
Reynolds. Are you going to give us 
another good opener for contrast?” 

Of course. I’ll even give you two 
goodies from two of the best-known 
sf writers. Observe: 

Were they truly intelligent? By 
themselves, that is? I don’t know 
and I don’t how how we can 
ever find out. 

If they were not truly in-

‘‘That is a grabber, Alter. Who 
wrote it?” 

Tell you in a few seconds, Geis. 
Read this one: 

In the nightime heart of Bei- 
rut, in one of a row of general- 
address transfer booths, Louis 
Wu flicked into reality. 

His foot-length queue was as 
white and shiny as artificial 
snow. His skin and depilated 
scalp were chrome yellow; the 
irises of his eyes were gold; his 
robe was royal blue with a 

152 



golden steroptic dragon superim- 
posed. In the instant he ap- 
peared, he was smiling widely 
showing pearly, perfect standard 
teeth. Smiling and waving. But 
the smile was already fading, 
and in a moment it was gone, 
and the sag of his face was like a 
rubber mask melting. Louis Wu 
showed his age. 

“Ahh, Alter. I remember that 
one.” 

You should, Geis. The first quote 
was the opening of The Puppet 
Masters by Robert A. Heinlein. The 
one you remembered was the first 
few lines of Larry Niven’s 
Ringworld. They both grab in dif- 
ferent ways. The Heinlein quote 
raises all kinds of must-be-answered 
questions in the reader’s mind and 
he’ll read on to find the answers. 
The Niven quote shows us a future 
with everyday matter-transmitters 
and makes us wonder why Wu was 
faking — perhaps — that smiling good- 
bye. The passage is exotic, smooth 
and intriguing. The reader wants to 
know more, to be further enter- 
tained by a writer whom he senses 
is a hell of a storyteller. 

‘‘Alter, are you telling me and 
our readers, that just by reading the 
first few paragraphs of a story or a 
novel, it’s possible to judge the 
merits and entertainment potential 
of the whole?” 

Well, yeah, I think that’s true 
ninety-five per cent of the time. The

really good writer will show himself 
instantly. He knows the importance 
of the first lines, of the first page. 
The less skilled, the less talented, 
the less concerned writer, the lazy 
writer, will betray himself in the 
first two or three paragraphs. Con- 
sider the following: 

I stood behind the pulpit and 
watched them file smugly into 
their pews, as they had obviously 
done every Sunday of their lives 
and as their parents had all done 
before them. Life in a small 
town like Middlefield was built 
upon such rituals, as I was com- 
ing to find out. If you knew ev- 
eryone who lived around you, 
and were kept in close proximity 
to them, you needed such stan- 
dards of behavior to keep you 
from tearing their throats out 
after a couple of years. People 
deviated from those rituals only 
at their own risk. In one way, at 
least, it was comforting — I knew 
I had a captive audience for the 
length of my service. After that 
was anybody’s guess. 

Light streaming in through the 
windows made the front pews 
hotter than the shadowed ones in 
back, which gave everyone an 
excuse not to sit close to the 
front. I wasn’t fooled by their 
excuses; after more than a year 
in Middlefield, I was still an 
outsider — the minister from the 
big city who has invaded the 
parish of the late lamented Re-

verend Brand. My predecessor 

had served this con — 

“Hey, Alter, what are you quot- 
ing from, some religious novel? 
Some epic of the Midwest involving 
a tormented young minister who 
tries to make improvements, who 
falls in love with the banker’s wife, 
who suffers a crisis of faith, 
who — ” 

Nope, Geis. This is from a 
science-fiction novel published in 
nineteen seventy-six. 

“How much longer does it go on 
like that?” 

It goes on for five pages before 
anything science fictiony or sus- 
penseful or tension-inducing hap- 
pens. Five pages of ministerial 
trivia and setting-of-the-stage and 
desultory introduction-of-characters , 
and minor characters at that. 

“I don’t understand how a com- 
petent editor could allow that to get 
past him.” 

I don’t either, Geis. That quote is 
from The Seeker by David Bischoff 
and Christopher Lampton. It was 
Laser Book Number Thirty and the 
Laser line was edited by Roger El- 
wood. I suspect that poorly edited 
and poorly written books like The 
Seeker are major reasons for Laser’s 
failure and death. 

“Are you going to inflict any 
more examples on us? Don’t you 
think you’ve made your point?” 

Yes, I guess I have. There will 
be screams of agony from certain 

154 



quarters but I am here asserting 
that. By Ghod, you can judge a 
book or a story by its first few 
paragraphs. You can take the meas- 
ure of the writer by how well he 
treats his readers on the first page. 
And I would urge readers to make 
these judgments. Readers are what 
make science fiction the expanding 
genre that it is at the moment and 
unless they are given good stuff to 
read, they’ll simply put down the 
books and mags and slowly walk 
away. 

“Of course. Alter, this also puts 
a greater responsibility on the 
editors since they choose the stories 
and novels that are published. Are 
you saying they are or have been 
lax?” 

Yes. Too often they’ll be too 
lazy — or too intimidated by a Big 
Name Pro — to insist on changes or 
to do the manuscript editing re- 
quired. 

“Care to give any editorial 
names?” 

I’m not that crazy, Geis. But I 
will say that analog has had of 
late a lot of pedestrian stories with 
dull, tedious beginnings. Ben Bova 
ought to spend more time in the 
office with a blue pencil in hand. 

“Oh, fine. Now that you’ve 
offended the editor who always 
wins the Best Editor Hugo, do you 
want to end this column before you 
stick your pseudopods any farther 
into your mouth?” 

Yeah, okay. This column is end- 
ed.

Dear Mr. Baen: 

Regarding Mr. Cooper’s letter in the 
July issue. 

Is there really someone out there who 
does not know why there are so few 
women who read and write science fic- 
tion? 

Two or three years ago the editor of a 
major science-fiction monthly made the 
statement that few of the stories by 
women that were submitted were pub- 
lished because they were either poorly 
written, or “dealt with feminine con- 
cerns.’’ Whichever Mr. B. it was 
should have been given a Golden Pig 
Award. Speculative fiction always has 
been, and still is, limited to those concerns 
that fall into the traditionally masculine 
sphere. 

Also: when I was a young child, my 
wild play and bookishness were viewed 
with tolerance. But as soon as my 
breasts began to show, mother, 
teachers, priests, and peers began to 
exert tremendous pressure on me to 
conform to the image of a “young 
lady.” 

Men were the heads of families and 
did all the thinking. Women were the 
hearts and were not supposed to think at 
all. So it was ordained by God. 

The girls around me cinched in their 
waists and turned in their baseball mitts 
and books. 

I refused. There was no one to play 
baseball with, but there was a library. 

In general science and biology I con- 
stantly did extra work, not for brownie 
points, but from fascination. Acoustics, 



meteorolgy and the aurora sent me to 
the library every free moment I could 
glean. I always got A’s. I would often 
linger after class arguing with the 
teacher or asking him questions, or 
doing further lab work. Did this man 
ever encourage me? Ever suggest a 
career in science, medicine or research? 
Heavens no! That was for men! Of 
course it was all right for me to study 
biology and chemistry. I might want to 
be a nurse! 

I had always hated arithmetic, but 
algebra was something else. How I 
loved it! In geometry I soared on tan- 
gents, congruities and neat packets of 
pure logic all wrapped up in QED’s. 
Yet I was programmed for Latin and 
chemistry, and prevented from taking 
physics on the grounds that physics was 
“too difficult” and “took a lot of 
math.” And, of course, I needed the 
Latin for that nursing career I had no 
interest in. 

When I discovered Heinlein, who 
was 1 to share it with? The boys, who 
had no use for a girl “brain?” The 
girls, who resolutely avoided anything 
labeled “masculine?” 

When, in my senior year, 1 stub- 
bornly insisted on taking advanced math 
rather than the literature course I was 
programmed for, any psychiatrist of the 
time would have labeled me as ‘sick.’ 1 
was still reading adventure yams at 17. 
I obviously did not accept my feminin- 
ity and was afflicted with penis envy. 
When you guys thrill to swirling 
galaxies, it’s normal. When I do the 
same, it’s “penis envy.” Even though 
women’s liberation has made many 
changes in such attitudes, there are a 
good many psychiatrists around today 
who would make a similar evaluation. 

The pre-revolutionary Chinese were a

very barbaric people, we are told. They 
bound the feet of little girls, crippling 
them for life in the name of beauty and 
femininity. We Westerners are so much 
more civilized. We only bind their 
minds. 

Eleven years after I turned my back 
on that dreadful but fairly typical small 
town high school, I finally entered col- 
lege. By then I was married to a won- 
derful man, who preferred smart red- 
heads to dumb blondes, and had two 
children. 1 went to a junior college and 
majored in architecture. I took both col- 
lege transfer and technical-occupational 
courses. I finally studied physics. My 
closest women friends, a psycho- 
therapist, a civil engineer and a mu- 
sicologist, are all avid readers of sci- 
ence fiction.

Glad to know you saved yourself from 
the fate of so many other women! 
Maybe you can answer a question that 
bugs me: Why are at least half the best 
new writers women, even though the 
total percentage of women entering the 
field is still low?

Dear Mr. Baen: 

In reply to Larry Cooper’s letter in 
your July issue, I must say that he 
touched a raw nerve. 

As a one-time “closet” sf fan and a 
woman, I am still amazed at the reac- 
tion I get from people when 1 mention 
that I like sf and science essays. Most, I 
believe, have never had the slightest 
contact with either (and I must add that 
exposure to science classes in high 
school and college seems to have little 



bearing on the matter). 

Traditionally, women have been 
excluded from direct knowledge of sf 
by conditioning in their early years. I 
fell into this field by accident. While 
browsing in a local book store on a 
snowy day, I found nothing to interest 
me among the best-sellers, and hap- 
pened to see Asimov’s Foundation 
trilogy — and was intrigued by the fact it 
was a trilogy and (oh horrors!) by the 
cover. 

That was almost ten years ago, and 
I’ve been a voracious reader ever since. 
Over those years, however, 1 have met 
very few people who share this interest, 
and all of them are male. 

Obviously, then, there are so few 
women writing sf because so fe\v know 
anything about it. 

In one of Dr. Asimov’s books about 
his early life, he mentions having read 
sf magazines. 1 had never seen one on the 
stands here, or at my previous location 
in California. GALAXY is my first ex- 
posure to sf magazines, and I am enjoy- 
ing it immensely. Why can’t I find 
GALAXY and other sf magazines at my 
local store? I even have trouble finding 
regular sf books. Comment?

It makes us shudder to think that 
there are women sf readers so isolated 
they haven’t even heard of the 
magazines. If you and others in Sparks 
can’t get your store to stock GALAXY, 
you could subscribe. That way, you 
won’t miss the fiction — and you could 
also follow convention listings in the SF 
Calendar until you see one near enough 
to get to and end your isolation.

Dear Mr. Baen: 

I’d like to make a few comments on 
Dr. Poumelle’s column about energy 
from waste (“Can Trash Save Us?” 
July 1977). 

First of all. An Index of Possibilities: 
Energy and Power, is not by the people 
who did the Whole Earth Catalog. WEC 
was put together in California, whereas 
the Index was assembled in Great Bri- 
tain. Also, it should be pointed out that 
the Index people seem to take a more 
whimsical approach than the Whole 
Earth people. 

There was a publication dealing with 
energy issued in 1974 by the Whole 
Earth people, in collaboration with sev- 
eral other grdups, entitled Energy 
Primer: Solar, Water, Wind, and 

BioFuels (edited by Richard Merrill, 
Chuck Missar. Thomas Gage, and 
James Buey, published by Portola Insti- 
tute). 

It deals with “alternative” energy 
sources, and it devotes a significant 
amount of space to the utilization of or- 
ganic wastes. For that matter. The Last 
Whole Earth Catalog, published in 
1971, showed interest in the possibility 
of extracting energy from wastes (see 
pages 52 and 70). The only reason they 
didn't give more space to the subject 
was the relative lack of information at 
that time. So much for the myth that 
those concerned about the environment 
typically follow faddish trends (though 
there is a segment of the population 
which clearly does become faddishly 
“involved” with various “issues,” not 
just ecological ones). 

As for Dr. Poumelle’s claim that 
“those who would save the world” 
hold grossly unrealistic views on the po- 
tential of such energy sources, a look at

p.s. : Dr. Pournelle might be interested 
to know that the CoEvolution Quarterly, 
a magazine published by Whole Earth 
Catalog people, has given a great deal 
of coverage to Gerard O’Neill’s L-5 
colonies, beginning in the Winter 1974 
issue. They have published material 
both favorable and unfavorable to the 
idea, including items by O’Neill, Rus- 
sell Schweickart, T.A. Heppenheimer, 
Eric Drexler, Peter Vajk, and so on. 
(Incidentally, on page 14 of the Spring 
1976 issue Paul Ehrlich, in something 
of an about-face, comments in a gener- 
ally favorable way on L-5 colonies, and 
urges others not to dismiss the idea 
prematurely.) CQ will issue a book on 
space colonies some time this year. 

My apologies: / was told by the chap 
who sent Index that it was from the 
Whole Earth people, and l should have 
checked further instead of taking his 
word. 

I remain unrepentant of my remarks 
about faddish world saviours, but you 
must understand that I would be more 
than pleased if those who are “ Con- 
cerned' ' ' about the future were routinely 
to get good data and hard facts. I am 
very pleased to hear that some do. I 
wish those who write me weekly would 
inform themselves as well as Mr. 
Roberts seems to have.

Dear Mr. Pournelle: 

I find some basic flaws in your plan 
for handling nuclear material (which 
you outlined in the June issue). For in- 
stance, what if one of the tanks should 
develop a leak? If it were being “ship- 
ped about” at the time (that seems the 
most likely time for one of the tanks to 
start leaking), might it not contaminate 
a large area before something can be 
done? And who would go in there to 
patch it up? It seems your plan is not 
the solution. 

Andre Guirard 

Lafayette, La. 

At present, nuclear wastes are stored 
as veiy dilute liquids, this largely so 
that when the inevitable leaks take 
place, contamination is kept veiy low. 
Iso one has ever thought that storage of 
millions of gallons of radioactive liquids 
was more than a temporary expedient: 
indeed, it was thought that long before 
now, all those would be removed. 

The difficulty is not technological but 
licensing; the means to convert those 
liquids into a small-volume solid of 
glass (with the radioactive particles as 
part of the glass blocks) of something 
less than 50 cubic foot dimensions for 
all the nuclear wastes accumulated 
since the Manhattan Project — is avail- 
able. 

Agreed that the shipment of vast 
quantities of liquid nuclear waste is 
hardly a reasonable proposition, but 
that is not what is proposed. When the 
lawyers are finished arguing the matter, 
it will be turned into glass blocks, 
which can then be put wherever one 
likes; the Mojave as a temporary expe- 
dient seems reasonable to me. Glass is, 
after all, a veiy stable material — and it 
doesn’t rain much in the desert.
