THINK ONLY 

THIS 
OF 
ME 

Earth basked in her mellow 
yesterdays beneath stars 
ablaze with tomorrows. But 
Diana wanted love today . 

MICHAEL KURLAND 



I 

I MET her in Anno Domini and was 
charmed. The Seventeenth Cen- 
tury it was. Two weeks and three 
centuries later we were in love. 

Her name: Diana Seven; my name: 
Christopher Charles Mar d’Earth. 
Both of old stock, or so I thouglit; 
both certainly of Earth; both cer- 
tainly human, for what that might 
mean in this galactic day. She was 
young, how young I did not know, 
and I was gracefully middle-yeared 
for an immortal. I would not see my 
first century again, but I would be a 
long time yet in my second. I looked 



to be somewhen around forty, nor- 
mal span; she looked an unretouched 
twenty, except in motion when she 
looked barely teen and also ageless. 

Aimo Domini was my first pause 
in twenty years. I legislate in the 
Senior Chamber of the Parliament of 
Stars. We tend to feel, we beings of 
the Senior Chamber, that our efforts 
bind the intelligences of the galaxy 
together, for all that races still ag- 
gress and habited planets are still 
fused in anger. We also feel that, 
despite all our posturing, blustering 
and rhetoric, we accomplish notliing 
save the passage of time, for all that 
beings have not starved, races have 
not been destroyed and planets have 
not turned to stars through our 
efforts. This dichotomy slowly 
erodes empathy, emotion and in- 
tellect. 

So I paused. 1 returned to Sol to 
become again a man of Earth, an 
Earthman, and walk among trees and 
down narrow, twisting streets and 
wide boulevards— but mainly to walk 
among the men and women of Earth, 
who are my constituency, my an- 
cestry and my soul. The races of man 
are varied and the farther one gets 
from Sol the greater the variation, 
though all are men and can inter- 
breed and trace their language back 
to a common source— if they still 
have sex, if they still have language. 
But I no more represent the 
Autocracy or the Diggers of Melvic 
than I speak for the Denzii Hive or 
the unfortunate Urechis of Mol. 

I felt a need for history: to be one 
with Earth is to be a part of the 



sequence of man, a product of all 
that has come before and a precursor 
to aU that will follow. To return to 
Sol, to Earth, to man, to our 
common history: that was my plan. 

I spent tlie first month in the 
present, walking, looking, visiting, 
remembering— chronolizing myself to 
the fashions, mores, idiom and art of 
this most volatile of planetary cul- 
tures. Then I retreated to Earth 
itself, to the past, to Anno Domini, 
the religious years: twenty -four cen- 
turies called after the Son of the One 
God. The period right before what 
we call the present era, when man no 
longer needs any god but himself. 

Earth is now all past: the present 
comes no closer than Earth’s satel- 
lite, the moon; the future— I wonder 
at times, what future a planet can 
have when it has renounced the 
present. 

I picked Seventeen to start and 
was garbed and armed and primed 
and screened and out before I could 
say. All the world’s a stage /And all 
the men and women merely players/ 
They have their exits and their en- 
trances . 

The town was London and the 
year was sixteen-whatever. In this 
recreated past the years sometimes 
slip and events anachron— a fact of 
interest but to scholars and pickers 
of nit. Tlie costumes of our recreated 
century were exotic, but no more 
than the smell. Charles had been 
beheaded a few years before. The 
Roundheads had been in power for 
however long the Roundheads were 
in power and now William the

GALAXY 




Orange was about to land at Ply- 
mouth Dock. 

1 was sitting in the Mermaid 
Tavern, at a small table at the rear. 
Next to me, over my left shoulder, 
was a large round table where Ben 
Jonson sat deep in conversation with 
Will Shakspere, John Milton, Ed- 
mond Waller and the Earl of Some- 
place. As writers will when alone 
together, they were discussing money 
and I quickly tired of their talk. 

S HE walked in as I was preparing 
to leave. Walked? She danced 
with the unassuming grace of wind- 
blown leaves. She flowed across the 
walk and quickstepped through the 
door as though directed by a master 
choreographer and rehearsed a dozen 
times before this take. These are the 
images that came to mind as she 
appeared in the doorway. 

I sat back down and watched, as 
she came in. She was aware of 
everything and interested in aU that 
she could see, and the very air 
around her was vibrant with the 
excitement of her life. And so I was 
attracted and excited and aware be- 
fore a word had passed between us. 

A man too doltish to see what she 
was stood by the door as she passed. 
He thought she was something other, 
and he spoke to her so: “Hey, 
girl— hey, wench, you should not be 
alone. Perhaps I’U keep you company 
if you ask m.e pretty.” 

She did not reply. She did not 
seem to hear, but passed him by as if 
he were a wall. 

He reached out to grab her by the 



shoulder and I stood up, my hand 
falling to the handle of my walking 
stick. 

She spun almost before his hand 
had touched her. She reached out, 
her fingers appearing almost but not 
quite to reach his neck. He fell away 
and she continued the pirouette and 
came inside without further pause. 

I must have stood like stone, 
frozen in my foolish-heroic pose with 
half-aimed stick. She smiled at me. 
“No need,” she said. “Thank you.” 

I stammered at her some wish that 
she share my table and she nodded, 
sat and smiled again, introduced her- 
self as Diana and looked about. She 
was also, 1 decided, a visitor to this 
recreated Seventeen. I pointed out to 
her the round table next to us and its 
famous occupants, indicating each 
one with almost the pride of a 
creator, as though 1 had done some- 
thing clever merely to be sitting next 
to them. Diana was interested, but 
not awed. 

The sound of fifes came at us from 
a distance. A far rumble soon became 
the beat of many drums. The entour- 
age of William approached and we all 
went outside the tavern to join the 
patient mob that awaited his passing. 

First the soldiers, row on row, and 
for a long time nothing passed but 
soldiers. Then soldiers astride horses. 
Then soldiers astride horses pulling 
small cannon. Tlien a military band. 
Then more horses with soldiers 
astride, but now the uniform had 
changed. Then a coach and the 
crowd went wild— but it was the 
wrong coach. By now, unless he were

twelve feet tall, the new king was an 
anticlimax. I looked over the crowd 
and tried to tell which were residents 
and which were guests of Anno 
Domini. I couldn’t. 

If this were the real Seventeenth 
Century— that is, if it were historical 
past rather than Anno Dominical 
recreation— there would be signs. The 
pox would have left its mark on most 
who lived. Rickets would be 
common. War cripples would be 
begging from every street corner. 
This Seventeenth Century, the only 
one the residents knew, was being 
redone by a benevolent hand. 

The new king passed. His coach 
was open and he smiled and nodded 
and waved and was cheered. A stout, 
red-faced little man— anticlimax. 1 
laughed. 

We left then, Diana and I, and 1 
offered to walk her to her inn. She 
named it and 1 discovered it was my 
own. 

“How do you like this time?” I 
asked her as we walked. “Have you 
been here long?” 

“All day,” she said. “Then you’re 
a guest too? I wondered why you 
were the only one in the tavern I 
hadn’t heard of.” 

“Thanks,” I said. “In realtime I 
am weU known. My return to Earth 
was mentioned as primary news. I am 
a tliird of Earth’s voice in the Parlia- 
ment of the Stars. I am known and 
welcome in half a thousand worlds 
throughout the galaxy. I number 
some fifty life forms among my 
friends. It is not necessary that you 
have heard of me.” 



“You’re insulted!” she said, 
clapping her hands together. “How 
delightful! Now you make me feel 
important, that my words could in- 
sult one as essential as you. I thank 
you for feeling insulted. I am 
pleased.” 

I hadn’t thought of it that way, 
ever before. Somehow she made me 
glad that 1 had felt insulted. It was 
nice to be insulted for her: it made 
her happy. She reminded me of a 
beautiful half-grown kitten, newly 
exploring the world outside its kitten 
box. 



T he inn was a U-shaped structure 
around a central courtyard. The 
stables were to the right, the rooms 
to the left and the common room 
straight ahead. It had been called The 
Buckingham the last time I was 
there, some thirty years before. Now, 
after a decade of being the Pym & 
Thistle, it sported a new signboard 
over the door: Tire Two Roses. The 
device showed a red and a white rose 
thoroughly entwined. The landlord I 
didn’t remember— a small, chubby 
man with a wide smile carved into his 
unhappy face. I asked him what the 
new name signified. 

“It signifies I’m tired of changing 
the name of my inn,” he told me. 
“I’m becoming nonpohtical. York 
and Lancaster settled their differ- 
ences quite a ways back.” 

“Let us hope William doesn’t 
think it means you prefer the white 
and red to his orange,” I suggested. 
He looked after me strangely as I

escorted Diana across to the common 
room and we sat at a table in the 
corner. 

“Dinner?” I suggested. 

Diana nodded enthusiastically, 
spilling her red hair around her face. 
“Meat!” she said. “Great gobs of rare 
roast— and maybe a potato.” 

“I— uh— I think they boil their 
meat these days,” I told her in jest. 

“No!” She was horrified. “Boil 
perfectly good, unresisting roasts and 
steaks? That’s barbaric.” 

“O tempora, o mores!” 1 agreed, 
wondering what my accent would 
have sounded like to Marcus Tullius. 

Diana looked puzzled. I tried 
again, slanting the accents in a differ- 
ent direction. She looked more 
puzzled. 

“It means: ‘Oh, what times— oh, 
what customs!’ It’s Latin,” I told 
her. 

“It’s what?” 

“Latin. That’s a pre-language. An- 
cient and dead.” Now I was puzzled. 
Who was this gjrl of Earth who didn’t 
know of Latin? For the past four 
hundred years, since humanity had 
begun trying to recreate its cradle— or 
at least its nursery— all bom of Eartli, 
except those born on Earth, knew 
something of prehistory and the pre- 
languages: the times and the tongues 
of man before he met the stars. 

“You know what tongue was 
spoken here?” I asked her. 

“Common,” she said, looking at 
me as if I had just asked if she knew 
what those five slender tubes at the 
end of her hand were called. “The 
language of Earth. The one standard 



language of humans throughout the 
Galaxy.” 

“I mean,” I explained, “what lan- 
guage was spoken in the real Seven- 
teenth Century London? What lan- 
guage aU that beautiful poetry we 
heard discussed in the tavern by 
those great names at the next table 
was translated from?” 

She sliook her head. “I hadn’t 
thought—” 

“English,” I said. 

“Oh. Of course. England— English. 
How silly!” 

The servitor approached the table 
circumspectly, waiting until he was 
sure we had finished speaking before 
addressing us. “Evening m’lord, 
m’lady,” he mumbled. “Rose- 
guddenit. Venice impizenizeto.” 

Diana giggled. “English?” she 
asked. “Have we really receded in 
time?” 

“In time for what?” 

Diana giggled again. The thin lad 
in the servitor’s apron looked 
puzzled, unhappy, frightened and re- 
signed. 

“Would you go over that again?” I 
asked him. 

“Parme?” 

“What you said, lad. Go over it 
again for diction, please.” 

Now he was also nervous and 
upset and clearly blamed me. “My 
lord?” 

“Speak more slowly,” I told him, 
“and pronounce more carefully and 
those of us without your quick wit 
and ready mind will be able to 
comprehend. Yes?” 

“Yes, my lord.” If he could have

killed me . “Sorry, my lord. The 
roast is good tonight, my lord. The 
venison pie is very nice, my lord. My 
lady. What may I serve you?” 

“Roast!” Diana stated. “Thick 
slices of roast. You don’t boil your 
roast, do you? You wouldn’t do 
that?” 

The boy nervously replied that he 
wouldn’t think of it, heard my order, 
then removed himself like a blown 
candle flame, leaving not even an 
after-image. 

“You frighten people,” Diana told 
me. 

“It’s my most valued ability,” I 
said. “I shall not frigliten you.” 

“You certainly shall not,” she 
agreed. “My teachers were all more 
menacing than you— and more unfor- 
giving. And they didn’t notice my 
body.” 

I ignored the last part of her 
remark and stared into her blue eyes. 
“You went to an unpermissive 
school,” I said, smiUng. 

“The universe is unpermissive,” 
she said seriously. It was a learned 
response and I wondered who had 
taught it and why. 

The innkeeper approached us 
during dessert. “Good?” he asked. 
“You enjoyed?” 

“Indeed,” I assured him. 

“My pleasure,” he nodded. “My 
guests. There will be no reckoning.” 

“Gracious of you, sir,” Diana said. 

“Why?” I asked, being wiser and 
therefore trustless of hostels. 

“I am taking your suggestion,” he 
told me. “And I thank you by 
feeding you dinner.” 



“Suggestion?” 

“Yes. I am changing the name of 
the inn. Henceforth it shall be known 
as The Two Roses and the Tulip. I 
have sent a boy to notify the sign- 
painter.” 

II 

E WALKED into the night, 
Diana and I. Hand in hand we 
walked, although it was conversation 
and not love that bound us then. We 
contrasted: she bright and quick, 
with an aim as true as a hawk’s; I 
ponderous and sure as a great bear (I 
metaphor our speech only). We 
learned from each other. I arrayed 
my vast store of facts before her in 
the patterns dictated by the logic 
of my decades— she swooped and 
plucked out one here, another there, 
and presented them as jewels to be 
examined for themselves, or changed 
their position to create the fabric of 
a new logic. 

“These people,” she asked me, 
waving a hand to indicate the resi- 
dents in the houses around us, “what 
do they feel? What do they think? 
They are human, yes? How can they 
just spend their lives pretending 
they’re Anno Domini?” 

“They’re not pretending,” I told 
her. 

“But this isn’t the Seventeenth 
Century.” 

“For them it is. They know of 
nothing else. Weren’t you warned 
about postchronic talk while you’re 
here?” 

“I thought it was just not to spoil

the— the— flavor. Tliey don't know?'" 
“Truth.” 

“But that’s cruel— unfair!” 

“Wliy? They’re stuck in their lives 
just as you and I are imbedded in our 
own. Are we any less actors in 
someone else’s drama than they?” 
“Philosophy, like reUgion, is a very 
useful drug,” she didacted, “but it 
should be used only to condone the 
evils we cannot control— and not 
those we create.” 

“You’re quoting,” I guessed. 

“My most valued ability,” she 
agreed. “I have a memory like a 
wideband slow-crystal— the input 
can’t be erased without destructing 
the device. Do you condone this 
make-believe?” 

“It isn’t make-believe. And con- 
vince me that it’s evil.” 

“But it’s so limited—” 

“They have the whole world. 
Their world— the world of the Seven- 
teenth.” 

“They don’t— not in any real 
sense. This whole area can’t be bigger 
than— than— ” 

She looked to me for help. I 
shrugged. “I don’t know either. But 
however large it is, it’s also— in a very 
real sense— unbounded. How much 
can a man expect to see in one 
normal lifetime— especially limited to 
horses and sailing ships for transpor- 
tation? Any of these people who 
wish to go to France or the New 
World will get there. Aided by Anno 
Domini, they will arrive in their 
France without noticing whatever 
odd maneuvering the ship does in the 
‘Channel’. I’ve taken that trip.”

On the top of the science-fiction 
list this month is DYING INSIDE, 
Robert Silverberg’s big new novel. If 
you think you may have heard the 
title before, you’re right! A year and 
something ago, the book was serial- 
ized in Galaxy, much to everyone’s 
delight. 

The Chicago Daily News says the 
book is “ . .a fascinating speculative 
novel on the theme of telepathy.” 
Buy it! You’ll want a copy for your 
sf shelf of books to read and read 
again. 

When Silverberg is not writing 
(and/or lolling about in his swimming 
pool, soaking up the California sun), 
he’s editing memorable anthologies. 
And this month he has on tap 
ALPHA 4, the newest in his superb 
series. 

Collected in this volume are classic 
stories by Aldiss, Bester, Blish, Carr, 
Disch, Farmer, Knight, Lafferty, 
Pangborn, Spinrad and Tenn. Pardon 
our name-dropping, but ALPHA 4 is 
a book not to be missed! 




Turning to the adult -fantasy side 
of the house, we find HROLF 
KRAKI’S SAGA, Poul Anderson’s 
retelling of a famous Norse legend. 



THINK ONLY THIS OF ME 



13 




Anderson has long been known for 
his love affair with the legends and 
myths of the great Norse heroes. 

Coordinating, translating and re- 
telling the scattered heroic literature 
could only be the work of a scholar 
and a lover of the genre. And that 
could only be Poul Anderson. 




Every year, it seems, new readers 
pop up on the landscape who haven’t 
read some of the all-time favorite 
books in the field. So in among BB’s 
new titles, you’ll find fifteen old 
favorites— most with jazzy new 
covers. Good chance to replace your 
copies that are fraying around the 
edges. Good for stocking-stuffers, 
too! 

Here are the re-issued favorites: 
Fahrenheit 451 and The October 
Country, by Ray Bradbury; The 
Whole Man and Squares of the City, 
by John Brunner; Dragonf light and 
Dragonquest, by Anne McCaffrey; 
The Masks of Time, Up the Line and 
Thorns, by Robert Silverberg; DrunA:- 
ard’s Walk and A Plague of Pythons, 
by Frederik Pohl whose three “Star- 
child” books with Jack Williamson 
are also back; and The Midwich 
Cuckoos, by John Wyndham. What a 
heady group!

“What would happen if I decided 
to get up and just walk—” she 
pointed off to the left— “that way, in 
a straight line?” 

“You’d come to the edge,” I said. 
“Wherever that is.” 

“Yes. Suppose I were a native— a 
resident- then what?” 

“Then you’d probably fall asleep 
by the side of the road, and when 
you woke you’d suddenly remember 
urgent business back in town, or 
forget what you were doing there in 
the first place. And you’d never have 
the urge to roam again.” 

“You mean they dethink and re- 
think these people? Just to keep 
them putting on a show for us?” 
“Also to keep them happy,” I 
argued. “It’s for their own good. 
Think how they’d feel if they knew 
they were part of a, a display. This 
way they live out their lives without 
knowing of any options. It’s no more 
unfair to live here tlian it was to live 
in the actual Seventeenth Century. A 
lot better— the food is adequate, dis- 
eases are eliminated, sanitation is 
much improved.” 

“It sounds like an argument for 
slavery,” Diana snapped. “Or pig- 
farming!” 

W E HAD come to what had to 
be the main street of the dis- 
trict. It was paved and lit. Bayswater 
High Street, the signpost read. Tlie 
lights were open flames on stan- 
chions, bright enough to mark the 
way but not to illuminate. “Perhaps 
we had better head back,” I 
suggested. “In another half-hour it 



14 



GALAXY 




wUl be too dark to see our way.” 

“The moon will be up in twenty 
minutes,” Diana told me.’ “And it’s 
only two days off full. Plenty of 
light.” 

“Example of your memory?” I 
asked. 

She nodded. “I saw a chart once.” 

The houses were two and three 
story, the upper stories overlapping 
the first. Picturesque in daylight, 
they were transformed at dusk into 
squatting ogres lurking behind the 
streetlights. The few people left on 
the street were scurrying like single- 
minded rats toward their holes. 

“Some things are changeless,” I 
said, pointing my walking stick at a 
receding back. “Fear of the night is 
one such. These people fear footpads 
and cutthroats— our people fear the 
stars. Evolution, I fear, is too slow a 
process. Our subconscious is still a 
million years behind us -in the caves* 
of our youth.” 

“You mean that literally?” Diana 
asked. “About our people fearing the 
stars?” 

“Extraordinarily literally. Astro- 
phobia is the current mode. Not a 
fear of standing under the stars, like 
Chicken Little, but fear that, circling 
one of those points of light, is the 
race that will destroy humanity. The 
government spends billions each year 
in pursuit of this fear. I believe that 
it couples with the subconscious be- 
lief that we deserve to be destroyed. 
That aU Earth has turned its back to 
the stars to live wholly in the past is 
part of the syndrome— our fears unite 
here.” 



Diana asked me a question then, 
something about the deeper manifes- 
tations of this ailment, and I prattled 
on about how easy it was to recog- 
nize the problem, but no one was 
getting it cured because it was 
chronolous to declare the inside of 
your head sacrosanct— if you were of 
high enough status to make it stick. 
I’m not sure of what I said, as most 
of my attention was on three sets of 
approaching footsteps I was at- 
tempting to analyze without alarming 
Diana. In step, but not in the rhythm 
of soldiers— a slightly slower, 
swaggering step. Three young dandies 
out for an evening’s entertainment, 
no doubt. 

They rounded the corner and 
appeared under the light. They 
were well dressed, indeed foppishly 
dressed, and carrying swords— so they 
were gentlemen of tliis time. Or at 
least they were sons of gentlemen. 

“What say?” the first one said, 
seeing us. 

“Say what?” the second de- 
manded. 

“What?” asked the third. “Wliat 
ho!” he amended, strutting toward 
us. “What have we here? A lissome 
lass, begad! And unescorted.” 

“Madam,” the first said, “my lady, 
ma’am— chivalry is not dead! We shall 
prove this.” 

Diana looked puzzled, but com- 
pletely unafraid. I don’t know how I 
looked— I felt weak. “Get behind 
me,” I instructed her. 

“Yes, indeed,” the third amplified, 
“we shall chivalrously rescue you 
from that old man there, who’s 



THINK ONLY THIS OF ME 



1fi 




clearly attempting to have his \vay 
with you.” 

“We shall,” the second added, 
“expect a suitable reward.” 

“Is this some game?” Diana asked 
me. 

“No,” I told her. “These lads are 
going to try to kill me. If they 
succeed they’ll kill you, too— even- 
tually.” 

The first drew his sword. I twisted 
the handle of my stick until I felt it 
click. We were now about even- 
three swords against one sword-stick 
with a narcospray tip. Anyone within 
one meter of the front of the tip 
would fall inanimate ten seconds 
after he was hit— and I should be able 
to keep even three of them away for 
ten seconds. 

“These are truly enemies?” Diana 
asked me, staring up into my eyes. 
There was an undercurrent of excite- 
ment in her expression. 

“Yes,” I said briefly. “But don’t 
worry. Just stay—” 

“I trust you,” she said, nodding as 
though she had just made a prime 
decision. “Enemies!” Then she was 
in motion. 

S HE dove forward onto her shoul- 
der and pushed off as she rolled, 
catching the first one on the chin 
with the heel of her boot. He flew 
backward and came to a skidding 
stop on his back across the street. 
The second was just starting to react 
when she slammed him across the 
side of his head with her forearm. He 
slid slowly to the ground, folding in 
the middle as he dropped. 



The third was aware of his danger, 
although he had no clear idea of 
what this whirlwind was. His sword 
was up and he was facing her. I 
managed one step toward them 
when, with a small cry of joy, she 
was past his guard and had fastened 
both of her hands around his throat. 
She must have known just where to 
press with her small fingers, because 
he didn’t struggle, didn’t even gasp— 
he just crumpled. She went down 
with him, keeping her grip. Her eyes 
were alive with excitement and she 
was grinning. She had, somehow, not 
the look of a person who has van- 
quished a foe, but more that of a 
terrier who has cornered a rat. 

“All right,” I said, going over and 
pulling her off. “It’s aU right. It’s all 
over.” 

She looked up, small and sweet 
and innocent, except for a rip in the 
right sleeve of her dress. “He’s still 
alive, this one.” 

“No!” I yelled, when I saw her 
hands tighten around his throat. 

She stared at me. “The other two, 
they are dead.” 

“Leave him,” I instructed. 

“Yes.” She stood up, sounding 
disappointed. 

I took her hand and led her away. 
I began to tremble slightly— a touch 
of aftershock. Diana was calm and 
gentle. I had no empathy for the 
three ruffians— they had danced to 
their own tune— but I worried about 
Diana. No— I think rather she friglit- 
ened me. I was not concerned with 
the ease with which she dispatched— 
body combat ballet is not new to me.

GALAXY 




I worried rather about the joy with 
which she destroyed. 

I remembered to disarm the stick, 
so as not to shoot myself in the foot. 
“Diana,” I said, picking my words 
not to offend, “I admire the way you 
handled those men. It shows great 
skill and training. But when a man is 
down— more particularly when he is 
unconscious— you don’t have to kill 
him.” 

“But he was an enemy. You said 
so.” 

Semantic problem— or something 
more? 

“Christopher?” We stopped at the 
innyard and she stared up at me, her 
eyes wide. 

“Yes?” Tears were forming in the 
corners of her eyes and she was 
shaking. Delayed reaction? I held her 
and stroked her long hair. 

“Those men wanted to hurt us. It 
wasn’t a secondary thing, like 
wanting to take our money and 
hurting us if we resisted. Tliey just 
wanted to hurt us.” 

“True.” 

“Why would anyone behave like 
that?” 

It wasn’t the fight that had her 
upset, but the morals of her op- 
ponents. “You killed two of them 
and were working on the third,” I 
reminded her. 

“But that was their doing. You 
said they were enemies. They de- 
clared status, not I. They attacked 
unprovoked. And I had your word.” 

“Right,” I said, deciding to watch 
my words around this girl who took 
my definitions so literally and acted

on them with such finality. “Well, 
they behaved that way because 
they’ve been taught to think it’s 
fun.” 

“I don’t understand,” she said. 

“Neither do I,” 1 agreed. 

We retired to our separate rooms 
and I spent some time studying the 
cracks in the ceding in an effort to 
think before I fell asleep. 

Diana and I spent the next ten 
days together in Shakspere’s London. 
Diana was delighted by everything 
and I was delighted by her. We grew 
closer together in that indefinable 
way men and women grow closer 
together, with neither of us mention- 
ing it but both of us quite aware. She 
questioned me incessantly about 
everything, but gave little detail in 
return. I learned she had no family 
and grew up in a special school run 
by Earth government. I learned how 
beautiful she was, inside and out, in 
motion and in stillness. 

After the first week we shared the 
same room. Luckily Seventeen was a 
time that allowed of such a change. 
The innkeeper persisted in winking at 
me whenever he could, until I felt I 
had earned that dinner, but we 
suffered no other hardship for our 
affection. 

Then one day over breakfast we 
decided to abandon the Seventeenth 
Century. I voted for the Twentieth, 
and Diana ayed, although she knew 
little of it. “Those are the break- 
through years, aren’t they?” she 
asked. “First flights to the nearer 
planets!” 

I munched on a bacon stick. “Out 



of the cradle and into the nursery, “I 
said. “And the babes yelling, ‘No, no, 
1 don’t want to walk-haven’t learned 
to crawl properly yet.’ As though 
that skill were going to be of value to 
them in the future. Interesting times. 
As in the ancient curse.” 

“Curse?” Diana asked, wide-eyed 
as a child. 

I nodded. “May your children live 
in interesting times,” I said. 
“Chinese.” 

“Not much of a curse,” Diana 
insisted. “Where are the mummies’ 
hearts and the vampires and such?” 
“Now that would be interesting,” 
I said. After breakfast I pushed the 
call for Anno Domini and they re- 
moved us in a coach. They declothed 
us and reclothed us and back- 
grounded us and thrust us into an 
aeroplane. 

Ill 

T his dubious contrivance, all 
shiny and silver and with two 
whole piston engines— to keep us 
going forward so we wouldn’t fall 
down— flew us to LaGuardia Field 
outside New York City. Tlie field, 
like the aeroplane, was sleek and 
shiny and new and modern. Every- 
thing was modern— it was in the air. 
The modern taxi drove us to the 
modern city with its modern sky- 
scrapers muraled with the most 
modern art. The year was 1938 and 
nothing could go wrong. 

We checked into the Plaza and 
took a tenth-floor suite overlooking 
Central Park. It was evening and the

park lights, glowing over the paths, 
roads, fields, rocks, ponds, streams, 
lakes and other structured wild- 
nesses, turned it into a rectangular 
fairyland. The skyline surrounding 
the park was civilization surrounding 
and oppressing imagination, keeping 
it behind high walls and ordering its 
ways. This is known as interpretive 
sightseeing. 

Diana had a lot of things she 
wanted to do. She wanted to see a 
play and a movie and a zoo and an 
ocean liner and a war and a soap 
opera and a rocket leaving for the 
moon. 

“Everything but the rocket,” 1 
told her. “Your timing’s off by about 
thirty years. They haven’t even de- 
signed the machines to build the 
machines to build the rocket yet.” 

We compromised on a visit to the 
top of the Empire State Building, the 
closest thing to a trip to the moon 
that 1938 New York could provide. 

“This is all real, isn’t it?” Diana 
asked as we wandered around the 
guard rail, peering at Bronx tene- 
ments and Jersey slums. 

“In a sense,” I said. 

“I mean the buildings are build- 
ings, not sets, and the streets are 
streets and the river is a river and the 
ships are ships.” 

“And the people are people,” I 
agreed. “The original had eight 
million, I believe. One of the three 
largest cities of the time. That’s a lot 
of people to stuff into a small area 
and move around by automobile and 
subway.” 

She nodded. “How many people 



are here now— residents, 1 mean?” 

“I don’t know,” I told her. “I 
doubt if they have the fuU original 
millions.” 

“Still,” she said seriously, “it 
would be fair to say that there are a 
great many.” 

“That would be fair,” I agreed. 

“Why are they here?” 

“It’s getting chiUy,” I said, button- 
ing the two top buttons on my coat. 
“Let’s go eat dinner.” 

“How can we justify bilking so 
many people out of their lives— out 
of whatever value their lives might 
have— by making them live in an 
artificial past?” 

“How do their lives have any less 
value here than in realtime?” I asked 
in my best Socratic manner. 

“Suppose you were an inventor,” 
Diana hypothesized. “How would 
you feel to discover that you had 
reinvented the wheel— or the typer— 
or the bloaterjet?” 

“I’d never know it was a rein- 
vention,” I said. 

“But it would be. And you would 
have been cheated out of whatever 
good and new and beautiful you 
could have invented in realtime.” 

“I doubt Anno Domini encourages 
invention,” I said. 

“Worse ! Where shall we eat 
dinner?” 

We took a Domino Cab to where 
Glen Miller and his band were pro- 
viding the dinner music. The music 
must have soothed Diana, since we 
got through the rib roast and into the 
crepes suzette before the sociology 
seminar continued.

“Wliat about people like Glen 
Miller here— or Shakspere— who were 
real people in history? Are they 
actors?” 

“No, they’re mindplants. Each of 
them has the personality and ability 
of the character he becomes, to the 
best of our ability to recreate it.” 

Diana sat silent for a minute, 
considering, her mouth puckered in- 
to a tight line and her eyebrows 
pulled down in concentration. She 
stared at her spoon. Then she picked 
it up and waved it at me. “That’s 
disgusting. You don’t merely cheat 
them out of the future— you cheat 
them out of their very lives.” 

It was my turn to be silent. I was 
silent through String of Pearls and 
Goldberg’s Blues. Diana watched me 
as though expecting momently to see 
wisdom fall from my lips, or possibly 
smoke rise from my ears. I found 
myself uncomfortably defending 
policies I had never really thought 
about before. I tried to think it out, 
but was distracted by Diana’s stare. I 
felt that I had to look as if I were 
thinking and it’s very hard to work at 
looking the part and think at the 
same time. 

“I would say it’s more productive 
rather than less,” I said when I had 
the idea sorted out. “You know our 
Shakspere has added several plays to 
the list that the original never got 
around to writing. Saint Joan and 
Elizabeth the First— those are his. We 
haven’t cheated him. Both he and 
humanity have benefited from this 
arrangement.” 

“It’s not an arrangement,” Diana 



stated positively. “It’s a manipula- 
tion. It takes two to make an ar- 
rangement. Let’s dance.” 

T here is something deeply satis- 
fying about two bodies pressed 
together and moving together. The 
waltz and the foxtrot are more 
purely sexual than either the stately 
minuet before them or the frenzied 
hump after. We glided about the 
floor, letting our bodies work at 
becoming one. 

“Christopher,” Diana said. 

“Hm?” 

“I’m glad we’ve become friends.” 
“More than friends?” 

“That, too,” she said, squeezing 
against me. “But friends is something 
else. I think you’re my only friend.” 
“I hope you exaggerate,” I said. 
“That’s very sad.” 

We danced silently for a moment. 
Then Diana stopped and pulled me 
back to our table. We sat down. 
“This is a major thing, isn’t it?” 
“Friendship?” 

“No. Anno Domini and this whole 
recreation. How many different his- 
torical times are there?” 

“You’re so beautiful and so 
serious and so young,” I said. “And 
so intent— and so knowledgeable in, 
some fields and so ignorant in others. 
Whoever brought you up had strange 
educational values.” 

“I told you I don’t like talking 
about that,” she said. Her expression 
could best be described as petulant. 

“It requires no conversation,” I 
told her. “Fifty.”

“Fifty historical periods?” she 
said, instantly picking up the thread. 
One of the things I adrriired, that 
ability. “But there aren’t that many 
centuries!” 

“Many are covered with more than 
one set. The really popular ones are 
started every twenty-five years. All 
have one, at least. There may be 
some centuries that appeal not at all 
to you, but someone has a need for 
them.” 

“What sort of need? Why that 
word?” 

“Ah! Now we speak of purpose: 
what you asked me before. The past 
is Earth’s only industry. Its function 
is to hold together the more than 
two hundred diverse human cultures, 
spread out on close to a thousand 
planets, circling as many suns. Tens 
of thousands of people from aU these 
planets, all these new directions for 
humankind, are here at any one time, 
sharing the one thing they all have in 
common; the past. 

“This maintains Earth’s pre- 
eminence in the councils of man and 
presumably bolsters her prominence 
in the Parliament of Stars. But more 
important; it provides a living point 
of origin for the human race. 

“The psychologists decided over 
four hundred' years ago,' at the time 
of the Mabden Annihilation, that this 
was the best— perhaps the only— way 
to hold us together. Those of us who 
weren’t already too far out. There 
are external threats still, you know.” 

“I know,” Diana said dryly. “You 
mentioned the fear syndrome earlier 
in this connection.” 



“It should be taken seriously,” I 
insisted. “Here on Earth you feel 
secure, but it’s only because you’re 
so far away from the action. The 
Denzii— ” 

“I take it very seriously,” Diana 
assured me. “So seriously that I’d 
prefer not to talk about it even 
now.” 

“Yes. I didn’t mean to frighten 
you.” 

“Frigliten?” Diana smiled gently. 
“No, you don’t do that. TeU me, 
what else is there to do in this year, 
in this town?” 

We took the subway to the 
Battery and walked quietly on the 
grass around the Aquarium, which 
was closed and shuttered for the 
night. Then we took the ferry over to 
Staten Island and stood in the open 
on the top deck, letting the cold 
brinewind flap our coats and sting 
our cheeks. We waved to the Statue 
of Liberty and she smiled at us— or 
perhaps it was a trick of the light. I 
had my coat wrapped around Diana 
and she huddled against my chest 
and I felt young and bold and ready 
to explore uncharted worlds. We 
talked of minor things and we shared 
a cup of coffee, black and four 
sugars, and I think, perhaps, realized 
fuUy that we were in love. 

T he next day we went to the 
Bronx Zoo in the morning, came 
back to Manhattan in early afternoon 
for a matinee of Our Town, and then 
returned to the hotel to dress. A man 
was waiting in the sitting room of 
our suite. He was standing.

“Why, Kroner,” Diana said, “how 
deliglitful to see you. And how silly 
you look in those clothes here.” 
Thus she effectively suppressed the 
Who are you and what are you doing 
in my room? that I had been about 
to contribute to the occasion. Kroner 
was a short man with too much hair 
on his head. He wore a onesuit that 
squeezed around liis stocky, overly 
muscled body. The weightlifter is a 
physical type I have always disliked. 
I didn’t recognize the Identification 
and Position badge he wore, except 
that it was medium-high status and 
something to do with education. 

“Who is he?” 

“Kroner,” Diana said. “My pro- 
fessor— or one of. And this is Chris- 
topher Mar.” 

“Delighted.” Clearly he lied. 

“Surprised,” I said. We touched 
hands. “To what do we owe this visit 
and what may we do for you? Any 
professor of Diana’s—” I waved a 
hand vaguely. The current trend to- 
ward the vague can be very useful in 
conversation. 

“I suppose you know what you’re 
doing?” Kroner asked coldly. 

“I have no idea of what that 
means,” 1 told him. “At which of us 
are you sneering?” 

“Both of you, I suppose,” Kroner 
said. He sighed and sat down on the 
sofa. “You’re right, I was being 
hostile. And there’s no reason. 
You’re a very important man, Senior 
Senator Mar— there’s no way I can 
threaten you. And Grecia knows I’m 
only interested in protecting and 
helping her. When she disappeared 



from Seventeen without notifying 
us—” 

“Who?” I interrupted. 

“Grecia. Your companion.” 

“Is that right?” I asked Diana 
(Grecia). 

She nodded. 

“Of course you have a perfect 
right-” 

“What does she call herself?” 
Kroner asked. 

“Diana Seven,” I said. Diana 
(Grecia) looked defiantly down at 
Kroner and remained silent. 

Kroner nodded thoughtfully. “Of 
course,” he said. “A clear choice. 
'Fhen he doesn’t know? You haven’t 
told him?” 

“No,” Diana (Grecia) said. “Why 
should I?” 

“Of course,” Kroner repeated. 
“From your point of view, no rea- 
son. You’ve always been the most 
stubborn and independent-minded. 
No matter how much we strive for 
uniformity. Not that we mind, you 
understand— it’s just that the varia- 
tions make the training more diffi- 
cult to program. I suppose it will 
make you harder to predict in action, 
so it’s all for the best.” 

“Haven’t told me what?” I de- 
manded. I tried to picture some 
horrible secret, but nothing would 
come to mind. 

“Diana Seven is not a name,” 
Kroner told me, “it’s a designation. 
Choosing it as her alias is the sort of 
direct thinking we’ve come to expect 
from Grecia.” 

“It’s a comment,” Diana (Grecia) 
said.

“Grecia is number seven in an 
official government program known 
as Project Diana,” Kroner said. “The 
number is arbitrary.” 

“So is the name,” Diana (Grecia) 
said. “You know how I was named? 
Listen, I’ll recite the names of the 
first seven girls, in order— that should 
give you the idea: Adena, Beth, 
Claudia, Debra, Erdra, Fidlia, Grecia. 
It goes on like that. I prefer Diana 
Seven, it’s more honest.” 

“Diana Seven you are to me 
forever,” I told her. “I don’t under- 
stand, though. What sort of govern- 
ment project?” 

“This is going to sound silly,” 
Kroner said, managing to look apolo- 
getic, “but I don’t think you have 
the need to know.” 

“I might not have the— but I do 
indeed need to know very badly, and 
1 can develop the official Need to 
Know in a very few minutes real- 
time.” 

“I will tell everything,” Diana said, 
sitting down on a straightback chair 
and crossing her shapely legs. “What 
do you push to get them to bring up 
drinks?” 

“I’ll do it,” I said, picking up the 
housephone and dialing. “What 
would you like?” 

“Coffee,” Diana said. 

“Another profession,” Kroner 
said. “I guess you’re right— we’d 
better talk about it.” 

“Something harder than coffee for 
you,” I said, and ordered a pot of 
coffee and a portable bar sent up. 
“Grecia-” 

“Call her Diana— she prefers it.” 



K roner shrugged. He was not 
very happy. “Diana is a GAM. 
Project Diana is one of a series of 
GAM projects that Future is 
funding.” 

GAM = Genetically Altered Man. 
GAMs were in disfavor now, at least 
on Earth, as it was felt that no 
alteration of the zygote could make 
up for a happy home life, or some 
such illogic. 

“I thought the Bureau of the 
Future was only involved in long- 
range planning of city growth and 
transportation and that sort of 
thing,” I said. 

“And defense,” Kroner told me. 
“Diana is a defense project.” 

That stopped me. I went into the 
bedroom to take off my tie and 
think of something clever to ask. 

“What do you mean, ‘a defense 
project’?” I cleverly asked when I 
returned. The bar was ported in then, 
so I had to wait for my answer. The 
waiter tried hard to preserve his air 
of waiterly detachment and not stare 
at Kroner, and even harder not to 
smile. 

Kroner glared at him and stood 
up, flexing his biceps under the 
skintight onesuit. “What’s the 
matter?” he demanded. “What are 
you staring at? Haven’t you ever seen 
a Frog Prince before?” 

The waiter merely gulped and fled 
the room. We all burst out laughing 
and I remembered that in my youth 
one of my closest friends had been a 
weightlifter. “You really should have 
dressed for the period,” I told 
Kroner.

He shrugged. “I was wearing a 
period overcoat,” he said, gesturing 
to a crumpled garment lying over a 
chair. 

I fixed our various drinks and we 
sipped them and stared at each other. 
“We’ve been keeping an eye on the 
girls while they were on their trav- 
els,” Kroner said. “When Diana 
took off with you we got worried. 
Diana has a certain reputation among 
the staff as a trouble-maker and you 
are a— prominent senator. The combi- 
nation could be explosive.” 

“How?” I asked. 

“The projects are played down,” 
Kroner said. “For us, any press is 
bad. We’d be caught between two 
fires; those who are afraid of any 
GAM projects— the ‘The only good 
superman is a dead superman’ 
group— and those who would feel 
sorry for Diana and her sisters— poor 
little girls deprived of a home life and 
mother love and apple pie.” 

“It might have been nice, you 
know, all that stuff,” Diana said, a 
surface anger in her voice covering 
some deeper emotion. “Why do 
people decide they have the right to 
do what’s good for other people?” 

“What?” I asked, feeling ignorant 
and ignored. 

“We didn’t exactly do it because it 
was good for you,” Kroner said 
sadly. “We did it because it was 
necessary for us. We never lied to 
you about that.” 

“Great ethics,” Diana said in a 
low, clipped voice that had an under- 
tone of controlled scream. “We 
screwed up your life from before you 



were born, but at least we didn’t lie 
to you— and that makes it all all 
right.” She turned to me. “Did you 
know I’m a mule?” she demanded. 

“What?” 

“A mule. Or perhaps a hinny. 
Except instead of a cross between a 
jackass and a mare, I’m a cross 
between a human gamete and a 
micro-manipulator. Sterile.” 

“You mean you’re—” 

“No pills, no inserts, no children— 
no chance. Just me. Dead end. Super- 
mule.” 

I went over to hold her, to show I 
understood, but she drew away. 
Mulelike, I couldn’t help thinking, in 
her anger. “I’m on your side, you 
know,” I said to her. She nodded, 
but stayed encased in herself. 

I asked Kroner, “In what way is 
this girl a weapon?” 

“Not a weapon,” Kroner said. 
“More like a soldier.” 

“A hunting dog,” Diana said. Well, 
it was a better self-image than a 
mule. 

Kroner nodded. “In a way. Super- 
fast reflexes, for one thing. One of 
the reasons she’s small: information 
travels to the brain faster. Nerves 
react and transmit faster. Eyes see 
farther into the infrared and ultra- 
violet. Raw strength is of little use 
today. You know how old she is?” 

I didn’t. “I’m not good at guessing 
age,” I said. 

“Twelve,” Kroner said. 

There was, I believe, a long pause 
then. 

“Do you mind?” Diana asked 
softly.

“I am surprised,” I said. 

“The tendency in naturally 
evolved high intelligence is for longer 
childhoods, not shorter,” Kroner 
said. “You must experience more, 
cogitate more, and have more time to 
experiment— play— to develop a really 
high intelligence potential. But it is 
possible to mature a high intelligence 
very quickly in an extremely en- 
riched environment. Twelve years 
from birth to adult is about the best 
we can manage. The body takes that 
long to grow and mature anyway, if 
we want a comparatively normal 
body.” 

“Diana is an adult,” 1 said. “No 
matter how many times, or how few, 
the Earth has circled the sun since 
her birth.” 

Kroner nodded. “Diana is a highly 
capable adult, able to handle herself 
well in almost any situation.” 

“I’ll not argue that,” 1 said. “She 
dispatched three ruffians who at- 
tacked us and did so with unseemly 
ease.” 

“v\h!” Kroner said. “We thought 
that was she. Very good, Diana. Of 
course, that’s what she’s been trained 
and bred for, so it’s fitting that she 
did.” 

“Trained for close combat?” 1 
asked. “What sort of war are you 
expecting?” 

“Not that,” Kroner explained. 
“For you, as for most of the rest of 
humanity, killing any sentient 
being— and many lower animals— 
would be murder. You’d have to 
steel yourself and be highly moti- 
vated to perform the act. For Diana, 



killing anything that isn’t human— or 
even humans who are clearly 
‘enemy’— is equivalent to hunting. 
And, like a good hunting dog, she 
enjoys it. Isn’t that so, Diana?” 

She nodded. “1 can’t see anything 
wrong with killing an enemy. And 
the fact that I know this is genetics 
and conditioning doesn’t matter-all 
attitudes anyone has are a result of 
genetics and conditioning. If you 
gentlemen will excuse me, it’s been a 
long day and I think I’ll go to bed.” 

K roner and l spoke privately 
for a short while after Diana 
retired. I suspect Diana listened at 
the door, as she was awake when 1 
went to bed, but if so I’m glad of it. 

“Does this mean I have to worry 
about Diana’s getting angry at me 
and breaking my neck?” I asked 
Kroner, when she had left. 

“Not at all,” he said. “If anything, 
the opposite. She may tend to over- 
protect you. To kill a human being 
who is not an enemy would, in any 
case, be murder, and she is incapable 
of murder.” 

“How does she determine an 
enemy?” 

“I think, at the moment, she’ll 
take your word for it. She appears to 
be fixated on you. You may call it 
love, if you like, but we prefer the 
scientific term.” 

“I appear to be fixated on her,” I 
said. “Whatever you call it.” 

“That’s fine. We approve. As long 
as you aren’t planning to use her— or 
make a political issue or anything of 
that sort— we’re on your side.”

“Wliat is she doing here anyway? 
Is school out? Vacation?” 

Kroner fixed himself another 
drink. “No,” he said. “This is part of 
her training. Mixing with humanity 
to learn more fully what it is she may 
be fighting for. Two years of this- 
going and doing more or less where 
and what she wants— then she’ll be 
ready for, let’s call it graduate 
school.” 

“More fixating?” 

“That’s right. Fixating on man. 
Those in charge of this project seem 
a bit afraid of their creation.” 

“Historical precedent,” I said. 
“Or, at least, literary.” 

“Yes,” Kroner said. “Take care of 
Diana. Enjoy her. Lx)ve her. She 
needs more love than the other 
girls.” 

“You mean she fixates more 
strongly?” I asked. 

Kroner smiled. “As of now,” he 
said, “I’m on vacation. Bye.” He 
picked up his coat and left. 

I went in to sleep with Diana and 
she held me tight for a long while. I 
think she would have cried if she had 
known how. I held her, but it’s hard 
to comfort someone who cannot cry. 

B ack in realtime— away from 
Earth and Anno Domini— I used 
my status to find out about the 
Project. Diana opted to stay with me. 
We fixated well together. 

It was difficult, even for me, to 
open the private record of Project 
Diana. It was the most recent in a 
line of such projects dating back to 



shortly after the Mabden Annihila- 
tion. I immersed myself in it and 
read motive, intent, achievement, 
method, fear and design in the record 
crystals. 

Earth is afraid of its heroes. Al- 
ways has been. 

Diana is sterile by design. Female 
by convenience— easier to control 
without the Y chromosome. She is 
sterile by design. Safer. Can’t breed a 
superrace behind our backs. 

Diana’s cells won’t regenerate. Our 
long life depends upon regenera- 
tion— actually replication— of certain 
cells. Diana’s— let us call it tem- 
plate— is inaccessible to our tech- 
niques. Also by design. Safer thus. 
Can’t make long-range plans behind 
our backs. She will also age fast and 
be old by forty-probably dead by 
fifty. 

I went home that evening and 
cried myself to sleep. Diana held me, 
but the crying frightened her and she 
couldn’t help because I wouldn’t tell 
her why, and it’s hard to comfort 
someone unless you know why he’s 
crying. 

I have two years with her before 
she has to go off to prepare for the 
war we may never have. She wants to 
go. They want her for twenty-five 
years, she says, and she owes them 
that. 

We’re planning what we will do 
when she returns. There are so many 
things she wants to do and see in this 
vast galaxy. I promised to show them 
all to her. 

I hardly cry at all any more, even 
late at night. ir

4 4T DON’T know how to describe 

X it exactly,” Harry Norman 
said. “I still see things as well as ever. 
Things, I mean, like machinery and 
cars and houses and trees. And my- 
self, too. In the mirror, when I shave 
or—” He glanced down at his hands 
splayed on his thighs. Brown spots 
were beginning to appear on them, 
just as they had appeared on the 
backs of his father’s hands, he re- 
membered, when his father had 
reached fifty. “It’s not things or 
myself— it’s people, other people. 
The only way I can think to put it is 
that they’re-well, everybody is fad- 
ing.” 

Harry Norman was a stocky 



27 





ruddy-cheeked man with crisp black 
hair that was lightly flecked with 
gray. He held his broad shoulders 
back with a military stiffness that 
stretched his striped blue-and-white 
shirt tight across his chest. His dark 
summer suit was conventionally tai- 
lored. His black shoes were shined to 
a high luster. 

“I first became aware of it a week 
ago— exactly a week ago, in fact. I 
remember the day because that was 
when they delivered the new carding 
machine at the shop. One of my 
salesmen was standing in the door of 
my office talking to me. He had a 
hank of red yarn in his hand and 1 
could see the yarn and the clothes he 
was wearing distinctly, but all of a 
sudden his face blurred and his fea- 
tures ran together— like a fadeout in 
the movies, if you know what I 
mean. It lasted only a few seconds 
and then 1 could see his face clearly 
again. 

“I was startled, but I didn’t think 
much about it afterward. All of us 
were too excited about the arrival of 
the new carding machine that day to 
give much thought to anything else. 
But that night, at home, when my 
son Dave came in late to dinner and 
sat down opposite me, I noticed he 
had shaved off his beard and cut his 
hair and I started to say something to 
him about it. I’ve never minded the 
beard much, but I couldn’t stand the 
long hair, although I’ve never criti- 
cized it. So I started to say some- 
thing then— tell him how much better 
he looked— when suddenly the hair 



was all there again, down to his 
shoulders. And the beard was back, 
too. That was when I decided I’d 
have you examine my eyes.” 

The oculist, Charles Warren, a gray 
wisp of a man whom Harry Norman 
had known all his life, smiled and 
spoke as if he were humoring a child. 
“Well, now, Harry, it sounds like 
you’ve got something new for 
ophthalmology. Here, let’s try this. 
Read that third line for me again.” 

He slipped another disk into the 
heavy frame resting on Harry Nor- 
man’s nose and Harry dutifully read 
the line. 

“Oh, 1 can read as well as ever,” 
Harry said afterward. “Even fine 
print. But you, Charles— when 1 look 
at you—” 

He broke off, feeling foolish, con- 
vinced that his friend would never 
believe that his face was only a 
smoky mist above the glistening and 
sharply defined white shirt he was 
wearing, that the hand that had 
inserted the lens in the frame was 
only a gray shadow. 

The oculist continued the exami- 
nation and Harry submitted to the 
rest of it without protest. Afterward 
the two men went into the doctor’s 
consultation room and sat down with 
the doctor’s desk between them. 

“Have you been working pretty 
hard lately, Harry?” 

Harry shrugged. He had worked 
hard all his life. If you were in the 
yarn business, especially in New Eng- 
land, you had to work hard— most of 
the mills had moved south long ago. 



28 



GALAXY 




Oh, he had worked hard, all right. 
But he had enjoyed it and he had 
done pretty well. Even with both 
kids in college now— Dave and 
Lucy— he was doing all right. He 
could give them and his wife Dora 
just about anything they wanted. 
Early in the spring, when Dave and 
Lucy had said they wished they had 
their own swimming pool, for ex- 
ample, like some of their friends, he 
had had one installed. At the mill 
he would have the new carding ma- 
chine in operation in another week 
and that would make it as modern as 
any mill in the country. Yes, he had 
worked hard, but he liked his work. 

“Been worried about anything?” 

W ELL, anyone who read the 
newspapers and watched TV 
these days must worry, Harry sup- 
posed, what with the war in South- 
east Asia all those years and the 
unrest and the violence and those 
hijackings and the dmg problem and 
now inflation and the collapse of the 
dollar and the mess in Washington. 
But what was the use of worrying 
about something you couldn’t do 
anything about? Take the war. He 
had watched the same horrors on TV 
over and over for so long that finally 
he had gotten to the point where he 
was almost used to them or else he 
turned away and didn’t look. As for 
the kids, he never asked Dave and 
Lucy too many questions about their 
private Uves and just hoped for the 
best. As his friends said, if your kids 
weren’t in jail or mental hospitals 



these days you should consider your- 
self lucky. Of course his marriage had 
its ups and downs, like everybody 
else’s, but he really believed that he 
and Dora were happier now than 
they had ever been, all things con- 
sidered. 

“And physically,” Harry con- 
cluded, “I’ve never been in better 
shape. I had my annual checkup just 
last week and everything was okay- 
blood pressure, blood sugar, prostate, 
EKG, all that.” 

He spread his hands on his thighs 
and leaned forward. 

“But there’s another thing, 
Charles,” he said. “People’s voices. I 
mentioned Dora just now. You may 
remember her voice. It used to have a 
kind of harshness. I think it was one 
of the things that first attracted me 
to her. It sounded sexy when I was 
young. Then, after we were married 
for a while, it got on my nerves. But 
lately Dora’s voice seems to have 
softened. Sometimes I can hardly 
hear what she is saying. Sometimes I 
don’t hear her at all. I’d think I was 
getting deaf, except that I can hear 
everything else as well as ever— that 
noise out there in the street, for 
instance, and voices if they’re me- 
chanical— you know, on tlie tele- 
phone or TV. But when people talk, 
even in the same room— I don’t 
know . .” 

Through the cloud that obscured 
the doctor’s face Harry thought he 
saw him smile again. 

“Anybody getting deaf in this age 
is lucky, Harry.” 



AND NO BIRDS SING

As the doctor spoke it seemed to 
Harry that the hum of traffic outside 
rose briefly to a roar in the room, 
although the windows of the air-con- 
ditioned office were closed. 

“I’m sure I’m not getting deaf,” he 
said. “It’s only when people talk.” 
He shrugged. “Maybe I don’t listen 
any more.” 

The doctor began to tap on his 
desk with a silver pencil and, while 
Harry watched, the hand that held 
the pencil vanished and the pencil 
jigged on the desk unsupported. He 
was about to mention the phenome- 
non when tlie hand suddenly came 
back into view. 

“There’s nothing the matter with 
your eyes,” the doctor said finally. 
“I think you must be suffering from 
a nervous disturbance of some kind. 
I’m no neurologist, so you’d better 
go to one. Suffolk is a good man. 
You go see Suffolk. I’ll arrange it for 
you. Maybe all you need is a vaca- 
tion.” 

H arry doubted that a neurolo- 
gist could do anything for him. 
He was sure that what he saw— or, 
rather, did not see— was real, not 
imagined. But when he went out into 
the hot June day and drove back to 
the mill he tried to argue with 
himself that maybe his trouble was 
nerves, after all. Maybe he had let 
himself get too concerned about the 
state of the world. Maybe he had 
absorbed more than he realized of his 
children’s discontent. 

To put an end to his thoughts he 



turned on the radio in his car. Some- 
body was asking somebody tire usual 
questions about modern problems 
and whoever was being interviewed 
was using a great many big words to 
say nothing. He tuned in another 
station. On it a singer was moaning 
words that were obviously intended 
to be apocalyptic but were incompre- 
hensible. On a third station a man 
was whispering confidentially about 
irregularity. Harry turned off the 
radio. 

The shift was changing at the mill 
and when he got out of his car in the 
office parking lot Harry paused to 
watch the workmen leaving the 
building in a ^ray mass, like a huge 
snail crawling across the millyard. All 
he could think, as he watched, was 
that tliere were too many of them. 
They weren’t individuals any more. 
He could call hardly a dozen of them 
by name now. It was the same 
everywhere. There were too many 
people in the streets, on planes, on 
the road, in restaurants, on all the 
good vacation places. 

The new card would let him cut 
down on a lot of manpower— just as 
well he didn’t know all of them. 

As he watched the men and 
women cross the millyard all of a 
sudden their heads and hands and 
arms vanished and nothing was be- 
fore him but a moving mass of 
empty workclothes, shoes and work- 
pants and short-sleeved shirts. He 
rubbed his eyes and looked again. 
The headless, armless procession con- 
tinued toward the parked cars in the

mill lot. Saliva filled Harry’s mouth 
and, believing he was going to vomit, 
he bent over with his head between 
his knees. When he looked up again 
at the workers the heads and arms 
and hands were all back where they 
should be, attached to the clothed 
bodies. 

“Nerves!” he said aloud, con- 
temptuously. “I saw it!” 

But even as he spoke the assertion 
trailed off in his mind and became a 
question and he was telling himself 
that what he had just seen had to be 
an illusion. He would have to go to 
Dr. Suffolk, the neurologist, as 
Charles Warren had proposed. But in 
the same moment he reversed him- 
self, deciding to wait a while. He 
would cancel any appointment 
Charles might make witli Suffolk. If 
he was suffering only from nerves 
maybe the illusions would cease of 
their own accord. 

He waited a week, until the day 
after his fiftieth birthday, the day 
the new carding machine was in- 
stalled and ready for use. On that 
day he discovered that it might be 
disastrous if he waited any longer. 

Harry told the neurologist, Suf- 
folk, that, at his wife’s suggestion, he 
had invited his son to come down to 
the mill to witness the first operation 
of the new carding machine. The 
card was the very latest in mill 
equipment, he told Suffolk, and 
everyone from himself down to the 
night watchman had buzzed with 
pride and excitement while it was 
being installed. Dave had not wanted

to come to the mill, however, Harry 
said, because he had invited some 
friends over for a swim in the new 
pool at home. 

“I wanted to point out to the 
boy,” Harry told Dr. Suffolk, “that 
he was going to inherit the business 
come day and the least he could do 
was to show some interest in its 
progress. But I didn’t say anything. 
Dave doesn’t want to go into the 
business when he gets out of college. 
He thinks he wants to be a farmer 
and raise everything organically. I 
hate getting into that argument with 
him, so I said I hoped he would come 
in with me if he could and let it go at 
that.” The boy did show up finally, 
at the very last minute, just as the 
mill foreman was announcing every- 
thing was ready for turning on the 
power. 

“All Dave had on was a pair of 



AND NO BIRDS SING

ragged swimming trunks,” Harry 
said. “He was even barefooted. I was 
embarrassed of course. For him as 
much as myself. When we went out 
into the mill together I could hear 
some of the hands snickering beliind 
our backs. After aU, Dave is twenty 
years old and ought to have known 
better. But I didn’t say anything.” 

A carding machine, Harry ex- 
plained to Dr. Suffolk, is composed 
mostly of teeth— thousands of small 
steel teeth that meet on large cyl- 
inders revolving in opposite direc- 
tions. The new card stood at the far 
end of the long millroom, bright and 
shiny, its green paint glistening, its 
oiled steel gears catching gleams of 
the sunliglit that poured in through 
the high windows, its wire combs 
sparkling Uke diamonds. Harry and 
Dave joined the men and women 
who stood round the machine ad- 
miring it. “Okay,” the mill foreman 
shouted and the gears began to turn 
with a low rumble. 

F or several minutes they 
watched. Harry was sure that 
even Dave could not help admiring 
the machine’s insatiable appetite and 
the speed with which it devoured the 
fiber. Nothing escaped it. Every 
shred was caught in the endless inter- 
locking of the vicious little wires and 
was clawed into gossamer. 

“Isn’t it a beauty?” Harry asked 
finally, turning to his son. 

But Dave was no longer at his side. 
Harry swung about to see where he 
had gone and, not finding him in the 



crowd behind him, swung back again 
angrily, annoyed with the boy for his 
lack of interest. In tliat moment 
there was a loud cry at his side— a 
warm wetness splashed across his 
cheek and he heard the foreman 
shout for the power to be turned off. 

At the same time someone else 
yelled, “Mr. Norman! Look out!” 

Harry told Dr. Suffolk that he had 
believed for a moment that the blood 
on his face was his own, althougli he 
had felt nothing. But in the next 
instant the men were shoving him- 
aside and gathering about Dave, who 
must have been at his side aU the 
time, invisible. Now, however, Dave’s 
head and naked shoulders loomed 
above the workmen who surrounded 
him. 

“I’m okay,” Harry heard the boy 
say. “It’s just the tip of my finger. 
I’m sorry I yelled. It was my fault.” 

“I simply had not seen him,” 
Harry explained to the neurologist. 
“The boy had vanished temporarily. 
Maybe if I had glanced down when I 
turned to speak to him I’d have seen 
his swimming trunks. But I didn’t. 
He was carelessly leaning too far over 
the card and I jostled him and he lost 
his balance. Fortunately the card 
cauglit only the tip of his finger 
before the foreman grabbed him and 
saved him from the rest of those steel 
teeth. But, my God, Doctor, I might 
have killed him! I tell you, the boy 
simply was not there when I spoke to 
him. It wasn’t that I failed to see 
him— he wasn’t there. When I 
bumped into him I didn’t feel any- 



32

thing. There was nothing there.” 
Harry paused and tried ta gather his 
thoughts. “That’s a new develop- 
ment. Not feeling anything. Be- 
cause— well, untd today, when I 
shook hands with someone or when I 
kissed my wife, even if I didn’t see 
anything—” Harry wondered how he 
could convince the neurologist that 
what he was telling him was true. 
“Everything is disappearing.” he said 
hopelessly. “Everything that lives— 
men, women, animals— even you.” 

He looked hard in the direction 
from which Dr. Suffolk’s voice had 
come to him earlier in the interview 
and saw nothing but another white 
shirt like the occulist’s. But this 
time there was no blur above the 
starched high collar as there had been 
in Charles Warren’s office a week 
before. This time there was no face 
at all— nothing. 

“Even you, Doctor—” he repeated. 

Dr. Suffolk made no comment. 
Instead, a series of questions began 
to come from behind the desk in a 
voice that was barely audible. The 
voice asked about Harry’s childhood, 
the things he ate, whom he loved, 
whom he hated, what he dreamed of. 
As the story of his life was thus 
extracted from him, it struck Harry 
as a very ordinary one indeed. A 
normal and healthy childhood, no 
strong rebellions against or attach- 
ments to his parents, average grades 
in school, no tempestuous love af- 
fairs, a reasonably happy marriage, 
two kids who troubled him at times 
but gave him no cause for serious 



worry, moderate success in business, 
no torturing ambitions or frustra- 
tions, no extraordinary appetites or 
sexual aberrations, no recurrent 
dreams. To Harry it all seemed ex- 
tremely uninteresting. He had no 
idea of what the doctor could make 
of it. 

“I think you need analysis.” the 
doctor said finally. 

“If you don’t believe in a thing 
like that. Doctor, I don’t see how it 
can do you any good. Now, maybe if 
I were seeing things— but I’m not.” 

The doctor lighted a cigar— no 
hand held the match and no mouth 
supported the cigar. Afterward the 
cigar’s end pulsated warmly above 
the empty white collar and the 
smoke rose in blue clouds where the

doctor’s head should have been. 
Finally the cigar descended in an arc 
to an ashtray and lay there. 

The low voice came again. “Can 
you still drive your car safely, Mr. 
Norman?” 

The question, Harry thought, at 
least acknowledged that he had been 
telling the truth, that he was actually 
not seeing people. 

“I can see traffic all right,” Harry 
said, “and pedestrians, too— if they 
have clothes on.” He uttered a short 
laugh. “Maybe-in view of what 
happened to Dave— I’d better avoid 
the streets around tlie university. 
Some of those college kids, you 
know—” 

The cigar rose from the ashtray. 
The end of it glowed above the white 
collar and the oracular voice came 
once more through the smoke. 

“Maybe if you could get off alone 
somewhere for a while, Mr. Norman, 
where you would not see or talk to 
anyone, where there are no tele- 
phones, no TV, no mail—” The voice 
had begun to sound wistful. “If there 
is such a place left in the world,” it 
concluded. 

“I have a cabin in the Maine 
woods.” Harry said. 

“That might be just the place.” 

y^T THE end of the interview the 
white shirt rose from behind the 
desk and followed Harry to the 
door. Harry stopped and turned 
about. 

“Doctor,” he said, peering at the 
emptiness above the white collar. 



“tell me honestly. Isn’t it happening 
to you, too? Aren’t people fading? 
Can you see me, hear me clearly? 
Can you?” 

There was a moment of silence. 
Then Harry heard tire doctor’s voice 
again. 

“Mr. Norman, I can see you per- 
fectly. As a matter of fact, I have 
been having a little trouble with my 
own eyes lately, but while I’ve been 
sitting in this room talking with you 
it seems to have cleared up. I can see 
you perfectly. There is a very small 
mole under your right eye and you 
cut yourself on the neck just below 
your right ear when you shaved this 
morning. You used a styptic pencil 
or powder and there is still a faint 
smudge of white there. Brown spots 
are beginning to appear on the backs 
of your hands and you keep looking 
at them. Does that convince you?” 

“I suppose then you think I am 
crazy.” Harry Norman said. 

Dr. Suffolk was silent for a long 
time. Finally he said quietly, “Every- 
body is crazy, as you put it, in one 
way or another.” 

“Well, a vacation in the Maine 
woods isn’t going to cure me!” Harry 
blurted out in sudden anger. “There’s 
nothing I’d like better, but I’ve 
promised my wife we’d go on a 
cruise. Anyhow, do you know what I 
think? I think maybe I’m the only 
one in the world who isn’t crazy. I 
think maybe I’m the only one who is 
seeing — or not seeing— what is 
happening. Dr. Suffolk, ever since I 
came into this room you haven’t had

a head on your shoulders or hands at 
the ends of your sleeves. I’m alone 
right here. I don’t have to go to 
Maine. I’m alone anywhere I go.” 

Driving back to his office, Harry 
regretted his final outburst and began 
to panic. Everyone is daft but me 
and thee, and sometimes I don ’t 
know about thee . Wasn’t that kind 
of thinking a sure symptom of in- 
sanity? He became paranoid about 
the neurologist. He imagined Dr. 
Suffolk picking up the phone im- 
mediately after his departure and 
calling Dora. Mrs. Norman, I think 
your husband needs surveillance, hos- 
pitalization ... He could see men in 
white waiting for him at his front 
door when he got home that night. 
He imagined shock treatments, elec- 
trodes on his head, knives probing 
into his brain. 

By the time he reached his office 
Harry had made his decision. With 
the door shut and locked behind him 
he telephoned his wife. 

“Dora, has a Dr. Suffolk called 
you?” 

“No, Harry, but I’ve been out 
shopping all afternoon. 1 was just 
coming into the house when you 
rang. Why? Is something wrong?” 

“Well, if he calls, tell him I’ve gone 
to Maine. Tell him I’m giving it a try. 
Tell him to let me alone for a week, 
two weeks, a month—” 

“Maine? What do you mean, dear? 
You know how you hate the no- 
seeums up there at this time of year. 
And we were planning that Scandi- 
navian cruise—” 



“There won’t be any no-seeums,” 
Harry said. Then he began to laugh. 
He laughed long and loud. “But of 
course!” he said finally. “There will 
be— for a while, at least. That’s why 
I’m going— because of the no- 
seeums!” He laughed again. 

“Harry, are you all right?” 

“Yes. No. No, I’m not all right. 
Look, Dora, I’ve been off my feed 
lately and I guess Dave’s accident this 
morning got to me more than I 
realized. Anyhow—” 

She gasped. 

“Dave’s accident? What accident?” 
“His finger. He cut it in the new 
card.” 

“Oh, is that what happened? He 
didn’t teU me. He came home with a 
cut on his finger and I put a band-aid 
on it. It’s nothing. He drove to 
Boston this afternoon to see a movie. 
Harry, what is wrong with you? You 
haven’t told me. Who is this Dr. 
Suffolk? What did he say?” 

“He said I needed a vacation, so 
I’m taking one. I’m going to Maine 
this afternoon, straight from the 
office. I won’t be home. I’ve got 
clothes up there and things. I can get 
there by midnight. I don’t want 
anyone to come up or disturb me or 
try to reach me by the phone in the 
village— except, of course, in an emer- 
gency. Do you understand?” 

“Oh, Harry, wouldn’t the Scan- 
dinavian cruise be just as good?” 
“No.” 

There was a silence. 

“Do you understand, Dora?” 

“Of course, dear, but—”

“Goodbye.” 

“Goodbye, darling. But Harry—” 

I N HIS car Harry Norman turned 
on the radio. Somebody was talk- 
ing to somebody about the world’s 
problems, using a lot of big words 
that meant nothing. He tuned in 
another station. A singer was moan- 
ing unintelligible words. On a third 
station a man was whispering about 
irregularity. He turned off the radio. 

The first night in his cabin in 
Maine, Harry slept a long, long time. 
And it seemed to him he continued 
partly asleep as he spent what was 
left of the first day lounging about 
the place in delicious indolence. He 
could all but feel his nerves relaxing, 
all but hear them slackening like 
violin strings that twang when the 
pegs are loosened. He did not stray 
from the cabin until the second 
day— after another long sleep— and 
that day he wandered only briefly in 
the woods before he was overcome 
by drowsiness and, dropping on a 
bed of pine needles, slept the after- 
noon away in the sun. When he 
ventured outdoors on what he be- 
lieved was the third day, he came 
upon a brook and its busy murmur 
made him -rilize how silent the 
woods were around him. No birds 
sang and there was no sound of 
insects or animals. Because the day 
was windless even the pine branches 
overhead were still. 

After that he lost track of time. 
But he felt no need to calculate the 
days he spent in the cabin or the 



woods. He found himself content 
merely to exist, to float in apathy in 
the stillness of his surroundings, con- 
vinced that he would be happy to 
continue forever as he was. It seemed 
to him that with the passage of time 
his physical self must be fading, as 
men and women all around him in 
the city had faded. His body became 
light and lost sensation. Not only the 
minor aches and pains of middle-age 
left him, but also the joyous feeling 
of being alive. He was not ecstatic in 
his new state, but simply content 
with the sense of being bodiless, of 
floating without substance in silent 
air. To avoid seeing himself, he 
turned the bathroom mirror’s face to 
the wall and did not shave. 

Harry was not at all surprised 
when one morning he awoke to find 
that it was snowing. It had been early 
June when he had come to the cabin, 
he remembered— now, he assumed, it 
had to be at least early October. A 
half-inch of snow whitened the vinyl 
roof of his car, parked outside the 
bedroom window. But as soon as he 
looked beyond the car he saw that 
the snow could not be the first of 
early autumn— it had to be a late 
snow in spring, for the wildflowers 
that Dora had transplanted in the 
yard with great care were in bloom 
and the few deciduous trees around 
the house had fresh green leaves. He 
was not amazed and only wondered 
idly whether he had slept a whole 
winter through. Two winters maybe? 
Three? Or, Hke Rip Van Winkle, 
twenty? He put his hand to his face. 



36 



GALAXY 




He felt no beard. He was, amazed 
then. Time itself must have stopped, 
for he was sure that men’s beards 
grew whether they were dead or 
alive. But if time had stopped— why 
was it suddenly spring? 

He leaped from his bed, ran out 
into the wet snow. His hands tremb- 
led as he opened the door of his car 
and turned on the radio. Immed- 
iately there was the voice again of 
somebody answering somebody’s 
questions, saying the same things 
Harry had heard on his drive up to 
the cabin, the same things, he rea- 
lized, that he had heard a week 
before that, when he had been re- 
turning from the oculist’s office. He 
tuned in another station and heard 
the singer moaning apocalyptically. 
He could not be sure whether or not 
the song was the same one he had 
heard before. They all sounded alike 
to him. On a third station a man was 
again whispering confidentially about 
irregularity. Harry shut off the radio 
and turned the ignition key. The 
motor started instantly. 

I N THE village, five miles from the 
cabin, Harry saw that the snowfall 
had slackened and there was no 
white on the ground. No one was 
astir in the streets and he kept on 
going. At tire intersection of the 
town road with the highway cars 
swished past in both directions— and 
as he waited for an opening that 
would allow him to join the pro- 
cession south and westward toward 



Massachusetts, he saw that the cars 
were without drivers, that not only 
heads and hands were missing but 
whole bodies, clothing and aU. He 
turned on the radio again. The man 
was still talking about irregularity; 
the singer was still moaning; some- 
body was still not answering some- 
body’s questions. He turned off the 
radio. 

Through an empty landscape, past 
empty farmhouses, on a highway 
crowded with empty cars, Harry Nor- 
man drove swiftly. At one point he 
saw a driverless tractor bumping 
across a field, dragging a hay rake, 
and he wondered how the machine 
knew that it was haying time, that it 
was . His thought stopped. He 
was startled. Why, it must be June 
again! At another place an un- 
attended drawbridge opened for a 
crewless trawler coming down a river. 
If there were no people, he won- 
dered, why was a trawler going out 
to sea to fish? Wliat would become 
of the fish that were caught? But of 
course— there were no fish. After that 
he thought of his business. If there 
were no people, what was the use of 
a mill that made yarn for the purpose 
of clothing them? But apparently 
there were no longer any clothes. 
They, too, had vanished with the 
living bodies. He glanced down at his 
own legs, one extended toward the 
accelerator, tlie other outstretched 
idly— but before he could be sure he 
saw them and was not simply feeling 
their existence as part of his body 
below his waist, he heard a police

siren and, from old habit, slowed, 
drew off the road and stopped to 
wait for the riderless motorcycle that 
pulled up beside hun. 

“Officer,” he shouted at the 
emptiness above the motorcycle, 
“what is happening? My radio keeps 
repeating. There aren’t any drivers. 
Officer-” 

There was no answer. The motor- 
cycle leaned crazily without falling, 
as if the law of gravity as well as time 
had been suspended and Harry sat 
still and waited, listening to the 
chatter of the police radio. Soon 
there was a traffic ticket in his hand. 
The motorcycle righted itself and 
sped on. Harry looked at the date on 
the ticket. It was June but the rest 
was so badly scrawled he could not 
read it. He pulled back on to the 
road, afraid now to look down at his 
legs, believing that what he would 
see— or would not see— might unnerve 
him. 

W HEN Harry came to the first 
red traffic light at the edge of 
the town where he lived all cars on 
the highway stopped and allowed 
those at the intersection to pass 
through on their green signal. When 
the light changed and he failed to 
start immediately a horn blasted 
from the line behind him. Machines, 
too, he thought, could be impatient 
and ill-mannered on the road, like 
people. 

As he entered the town the street 
lights came on, illuminating an 
empty dusk. He had to stop once or 



twice behind a city bus. Its door 
folded open. No one got in or out, 
but the bus waited for several 
seconds. Then the door shut and the 
bus moved on. In a shopping center 
neon lights blinked on and off and he 
saw a laundromat with machines 
splashing suds against their windows 
like the flume at Marblehead. There 
were no customers in the stores or 
moving in and out among the parked 
cars, although he noted that the cars 
were parked in the usual disorder of 
such unsupervised lots. Two became 
involved in a minor accident and he 
saw a police car approaching the 
scene. 

Harry’s home was on the far side 
of the town and he came to his mill 
first. It was lighted. The big illumi- 
nated clock atop the roof told him 
the night shift had come on ten 
minutes before. He parked his car in 
the office lot and went in. The 
offices as well as the mill were 
lighted. The clerical staff would not 
go home for another three-quarters 
of an hour. Nobody appeared to be 
in the big room, but electric type- 
writers were at work everywhere. 

“Hello!” Harry said in his usual 
general greeting to his employees, 
but no answer came. He was neither 
surprised nor dismayed, but moved 
carefully through the outer office, 
afraid that he might bump into some- 
one. 

As soon as he was in his private 
office, the door closed behind him, 
he picked up the telephone and 
dialed his home.

“Hello, Dora. I just gQt back. Is 
everything all right?” 

“Goodbye, darling. But, Harry—” 

“1 say, Dora. I just got back from 
Maine. Dora!” 

“Goodbye, darling. But, Harry—” 

“Yes-” 

Dora’s voice repeated the words 
over and over. 

“Goodbye, darling. But, Harry—” 

Finally he realized they were the 
last words he had heard her speak on 
the phone before he left for Maine. 

“Dora-” 

“Goodbye, darling...” 

He held the phone away from his 
ear and stared at it. The disembodied 
voice was hollow in mid-air. “Good- 
bye...” 

He dropped the phone to his desk 
and it lay there repeating Dora’s last 
words insanely. In a panic he went 
out by the private door of his office 
and down his private stairs three 
steps at a time. As he hurried 
through the mill to the parking lot a 
part of his mind was aware that the 
new card had just been turned off 
and was running down with a whine, 
and he wondered if something had 
gone wrong with it. But he did not 
stop to investigate. 

He had forgotten how much he 
loved Dora. He drove through the 
homeward-bound traffic like a mad- 
man, jumping red lights and stop 
signs and pulled up in front of his 
house in the suburbs with a squeal of 
tires. He did not want Dora to be 
vanished like everyone else— like him- 
self perhaps. He did not know what 



to expect when he entered the house. 
His heart was pounding hard as he 
leaped up the front steps. 

The door opened and Dora stood 
there to greet him, her face upturned 
for a kiss. He had forgotten what a 
beautiful woman she was. Behind her 
his bearded son stood grinning at 
him. 

“You’re late, darling.” Dora said. 
“It’s a shame you had to work late 
today of all days.” 

Harry could not believe his ears or 
his eyes. He had thought for a 
moment that she was fading, as 
people had faded momentarily in the 
beginning of his illness or whatever it 
was. But when she spoke, she was 
clearly back in focus again. 

“I—” he began, not knowing how 
to go on. 

Over Dora’s shoulder Dave was 
saying, “Happy birthday, Dad, Sorry 
I didn’t get down to breakfast this 
morning. How does it feel to be 
fifty?” And Dora was smiling up at 
him, ready for another kiss. 

So this was June second, the day 
before he had gone to see Suffolk, 
the day before they began the opera- 
tion of the new carding machine. He 
looked at Dave’s hands— there were 
no band-aids on his fingers. But of 
course— the accident happened the 
next day, June third. 

“Come,” Dora said. “Our drinks 
are ready. Dave made them. Soon 
we’ll have dinner. We won’t wait for 
Lucy. She called to say she had to 
stay for a sorority meeting, but she’ll 
come as soon as she can.”

D uring dinner Dora did not 
mention the cabin in Maine. But 
when she brought the birthday cake 
in from the kitchen, her eyes spark- 
ling above the candles, she said, “Oh, 
by the way, a Dr. Suffolk’s office 
called this afternoon. Charles Warren 
has made an appointment with him 
for you for tomorrow afternoon. 
Why did Charles do that, Harry? Is 
something wrong?” 

“No,” Harry said. “Charles told 
me I was okay.” But as he spoke he 
was remembering vividly the after- 
noon session in the neurologist’s 
office, although it seemed like a long 
time ago. And yet Dora had said the 
appointment with Suffolk was for 
“tomorrow.” 

“Then why this Dr. Suffolk?” 
Dora said. “Who is he?” 

“I don’t know. It’s a mistake of 
some kind, I guess.” Harry replied— 
and now he heard an echo in his 
voice and had the dizzying sensation 
of deja vu. He had said the same 
thing to Dora once before. In fact, he 
had come home to this birthday 
party and eaten this same birthday 
cake once before, the night before 
the carding machine was put into 
operation. Dora had told him then 
about the appointment with Suffolk 
and he had evaded her questions, 
because he had had no intention of 
keeping the appointment. Until the 
next morning. Then, when Dave had 
caught his finger in the new carding 
machine, Harry had changed his 
mind. 

“Well, I’m glad,” Dora said. 



At that point Lucy came in the 
front door, slamming it behind her 
and calling out, “Happy birthday!” 
and Harry Norman remembered that, 
too. He knew that Lucy was going to 
kiss him and flop down on a chair 
beside him and say, / hope you saved 
me some of your cake, Pop. I 
skipped dessert at the house. I’m 
sorry I had to stay for that old 
meeting. And that was exactly what 
Lucy did and said. As she spoke, 
Harry thought she faded for a mo- 
ment in the way that people had 
faded at first, but she quickly came 
back into focus. She wore blue jeans, 
with white buttons uselessly and 
ridiculously sewn down the outside 
of the fly and her blond hair was in 
disarray and kept falling over her 
wide blue eyes like a theater curtain 
and she was beautiful like her mother 
and Harry loved her very much. 

T hat night, in bed, long after he 
believed Dora was asleep, Harry 
Norman lay awake, puzzled. He was 
remembering Dave’s near tragedy be- 
side the carding machine and the visit 
to Suffolk’s office and the long stay 
in the cabin in Maine and the trip 
home with all life around him com- 
pletely vanished and he was sure 
those experiences were real. He was 
sure of it. It had all happened, those 
things and that other fiftieth birth- 
day dinner just like the one he had 
had tonight. And it had been real, 
too, when he returned to the plant 
from Maine only a few hours ago and 



40 



GALAXY 




there was no one visible in. the office. 
And he had heard Dora’s voke on 
the phone saying the same thii^s she 
had said a long time before. He was 
sure. But Dora had been very real 
here in bed with him tonight too, 
only a short while ago. And yet at 
dinner neither she nor Dave had 
seemed to have any recollection of 
the accident in the mill or his phone 
call or his long absence in Maine. Nor 
was there anything in their manner 
that made him think they had the 
experience of deja vu that had made 
him dizzy at the birthday dinner. 

Dora startled him then by speak- 
ing in the dark. 

“Oh, Harry, darling, I forgot to 
tell you. There was another call from 
the plant just before you came home 
tonight, while you were on the way 
home, I guess. It was the mill fore- 
man. He said the new carding ma- 
chine was all set up and ready to be 
put in operation tomorrow morn- 
ing.” 

And Harry was sure Dora had said 
that before, that other night, after 
the birthday dinner and after they 
had made love and he had thought 
her asleep at his side. 

“Harry,” Dora continued, “why 
don’t you invite Dave down to the 
mill tomorrow to see them start the 
machine?” 

And she had said that too ! 

Suddenly Harry was no longer 
puzzled. He was convinced that it 
was the machine, the new carding 
machine, something alien at work in 
the machine. It had to be. His “ill- 



ness” had begun on the day the 
machine was delivered to the mill, 
when the salesman in Iris office door- 
way with the hank of red yarn had 
seemed to fade for a moment. That 
had been the first time. And then, on 
the day they put the card into 
operation, Dave had become com- 
pletely invisible and Harry had 
pushed the boy accidentally against 
the machine and... 

...and tonight, he remembered, in 
the mill, he had been aware that they 
were turning off the machine— it had 
been running down with a whine. 

It had to be the machine. For a 
reason that Harry could not under- 
stand, the carding machine had given 
him a glimpse of what was going to 
happen to him, what some day was 
going to happen to everyone on 
Earth— when people everywhere 
would close their senses and their 
minds and concerns to reality and to 
each other and not give a damn. But 
now, for a reason also beyond his 
comprehension, it was giving him a 
reprieve by breaking down and 
stopping and thus starting time over 
again at the day before Dave was 
hurt and everyone vanished. Harry 
was no longer puzzled. He was sure. 
But now, for the first time, he was 
frightened. 

“Why don’t you do that, Harry?” 
Dora said in the dark. “Why don’t 
you invite Dave to the mill tomorrow 
to see the machine started?” 

“I’ll have to think about it,” Harry 
said. And Dora went to sleep then, 
but Harry did not. ★

SUPPLIANT 
IN SPACE 

ROBERT SHECKLEY 



To become an outcast was all that the 
alien wanted. Unfortunately, he had 
space, and spacemen, to contend with! 



I 

ETRINGER had been banished 
from his home planet of Ferlang 
for “acts of incredible grossness”— he 
had sucked his teeth insolently dur- 
ing the Meditation Frolic and had 
switched his tail widdershins when 
the Regional Grand Ubiquitor con- 
descended to spit at him. 

These impertinences would nor- 
mally have earned him no more than 
a few dozen years of Plenary Os- 
tracism. But Detringer had aggrav- 
ated his offenses by Willful Dis- 
obedience during Godmemory Meet- 
ing, at which time he had persisted in 
audibly reminiscing upon certain of 
his rather unsavory sexual exploits. 

His final asocial act was unpre- 
cedented in the recent history of 
Ferlang; he had meted out Overt 
Malevolent Violence upon the person 
of a Ukanister, thus performing the 
first act of Open Public Aggression 
since the primitive era of the Death 
Games. 

This last repulsive act, resulting in 
minor bodily injury but major ego 
damage to the Ukanister, earned 
Detringer the supreme punishment of 
Perpetual Banishment. 

Ferlang is the fourth planet from 
its sun in a fifteen-planet system 
situated near an edge of the galaxy. 
Detringer was taken deep into the 
void between galaxies via starship 
and set adrift in a tiny, under- 
powered Sportster. He was volun- 
tarily accompanied by his loyal me- 
chanical servant. Ichor. 



Detringer’s wives— gay, flighty 
Maruskaa, tall, thoughtful Gwenkifer 
and floppy-eared, irrepressible Uu— 
all divorced him in a solemn Act of 
Eternal Revulsion. His eight children 
performed the Office of Parental 
Repudiation— though ^Deranie, the 
youngest, was heard to mutter after- 
ward, “I don’t care what you did. 
Daddy, I still love you.” 

Detringer was not to be afforded 
the comfort of knowing this, of 
course. Cast loose upon the infinite 
sea of space, the inadequate energy 
systems of his tiny craft inexorably 
ran down. He came to know hunger, 
cold, thirst and the continual throb- 
bing headache of oxygen-deprivation 
as he voluntarily put himself upon 
stringent rations. The immense dead- 
ness of space spread on all sides of 
him, broken only by the merciless 
glare of distant stars. He had turned 
off the Sportster’s engines im- 
mediately— he had seen no use in 
wasting its small fuel capacity in the 
intergalactic void that taxed the re- 
sources of the enormous starships. 
He would save his fuel for planetary 
maneuvering— if that unlikely oppor- 
tunity should ever be vouchsafed 
him. 

Time was a motionless black jelly 
in which he was encased. Deprived of 
its familiar moorings, a lesser mind 
must have cracked. But it was a 
measure of his being that, instead of 
giving in to the despair whose objec- 
tive correlatives were all around him, 
he rallied, forced himself to take an 
interest in the minutest routines of 




44 



GALAXY 




the dying ship, gave a concert every 
“night” for his tone-deaf servant 
Ichor, performed calisthenics, prac- 
ticed High-speed Meditation, erected 
elaborate auto-sexual rituals as set 
forth in the Solitude Survival Book, 
and in a hundred ways diverted 
himself from the crushing realization 
of his own almost certain death. 

After an interminable period the 
character of space changed abruptly. 
The doldrums gave way to unsettled 
conditions. There were elaborate 
electrical displays, presaging new 
peril. At last a linestorm hurtled 
upon him along a narrow front, 
caught up the Sportster and swept it 
pellmell into the heart of the void. 

The very inadequacy of the little 
spaceship served to preserve it. Unre- 
sistingly driven by the storm’s front, 
the ship survived by yielding— and 
when the storm had run its course 
the ship’s hull still preserved its 
integrity. 

Little need be said about the 
ordeal of the occupants at this time, 
except that they survived. Detringer 
experienced a period of unconscious- 
ness. Then he opened his eyes and 
stared groggily around him. After 
that he looked out through the 
spaceports and studied his naviga- 
tional instruments. 

“We’ve completely crossed the 
void,” he told Ichor. “We are ap- 
proaching the outer limits of a plane- 
tary system.” 

Ichor raised himself on one alumi- 
num elbow and asked, “Of what type 
is the sun?” 



“It is an 0 type,” Detringer said. 
“Praise be to God’s Memory,” 
Ichor intoned, then collapsed, due to 
discharged batteries. 

T he last currents of the storm 
subsided before the Sportster 
crossed the orbit of the outermost 
planet, 19th out from the sturdy, 
medium-sized life-giving 0-type sun. 
Detringer recharged Ichor from the 
ship’s accumulators, although the 
mechanical protested that the cur- 
rent might better be saved for a 
possible ship’s emergency. 

This emergency came sooner than 
Detringer had imagined. His instru- 
ment reading had shown that the 
fifth planet out from the sun was the 
only one that could support Det- 
ringer’s life-requirements without the 
assistance of imported artificialities. 
But it was too far away for the ship’s 
remaining fuel and now space was 
doldrum-calm again, affording no im- 
petus to aid them toward their goal. 

One course of action would be to 
sit tight, wait and hope that a stray 
inbound current would come their 
way, or even another storm. This 
plan was admittedly conservative. It 
bore the danger that no current or 
storm would come during the short 
period in which they could sustain 
themselves on the ship’s resources. 
Additionally, there was the risk that 
if a current or storm should arise it 
would bear them in an unpromising 
direction. 

Still, there were risks no matter 
what course of action was taken. 



A SUPPLIANT IN SPACE 



45 




Characteristically, Detringer chose 
the more enterprising and perhaps 
more dangerous plan. Plotting the 
most economical course and speed, 
he set forth to cover whatever por- 
tion of the journey his ship’s fuel 
would allow, prepared to trust to 
Providence thereafter. 

By painstaking piloting and hand- 
metering of the fuel he managed to 
come within two hundred million 
miles of his destination. Then Det- 
ringer had to shut down the engines, 
leaving himself only a scant hour’s 
worth of fuel for intra-atmOspheric 
maneuvering. 

The Sportster drifted through 
space, still moving toward the fifth 
planet, but so slowly that a thousand 
years would barely suffice to bring it 
within the planet’s atmospheric 
limits. By a very slight effort of the 
imagination, the ship could be con- 
sidered a ooffin and Detringer its 
premature occupant. But Detringer 
refused to dwell upon this. He began 
again his regime of calisthenics, con- 
certs, High-speed Meditation and 
auto-sexual rituals. 

Ichor was somewhat shocked by 
all this. Himself of an orthodox turn 
of mind, he gently pointed out that 
Detringer’s acts were inapropos to 
the situation and therefore insane. 

“You’re quite right, of course,’’ 
Detringer replied cheerfully. “But I 
must remind you that Hope, even 
though judged incapable of fulfill- 
ment, is still considered one of the 
Eight Irrational Blessings and there- 
fore (according to the Second Patri- 



arch) of a higher order of magnitude 
than the derived Sanity Injunctions.” 

Confuted by scripture. Ichor gave 
his grudging assent to Detringer’s 
practices and even went so far as to 
sing a hymn in harmony with him 
(with results as ludicrous as they 
were cacophonous.) 

Inexorably their energy ran down. 
Half- and then quarter-rations im- 
paired their efficiency and brought 
them near the point of complete 
dysfunction. In vain did Ichor beg his 
master’s permission to drain his own 
personal batteries into the ship’s 
chilly heaters. 

“Never mind,” said Detringer, 
shuddering with cold. “We’ll go out 
together as equals, in possession of 
what senses we’ve got, if we go out at 
all— which I seriously doubt despite 
impressive evidence to the contrary.” 

Perhaps nature is influenced by 
temperament. Surely only for Det- 
ringer would she have obliged by 
sending a strong inbound current just 
when the ship’s energy resources had 
dwindled to no more than memories. 

The landing itself was simple 
enough for a pilot of Detringer’s skill 
and luck. He brought down the ship, 
light as a windblown seed, upon the 
green and inviting surface of the fifth 
planet. When he shut down the en- 
gines for the last time there were 
some thirty-eight seconds of fuel 
remaining. 

Ichor fell to his ferrominium knees 
and praised the Godmemory that had 
remembered to bring them to this 
place of refuge. But Detringer said. 



46 



GALAXY 




“Let’s see if we can live here before 
we go maudlin with thanks.” 

The fifth world proved hospitable 
enough. All of the necessities of life 
could be found with moderate effort, 
though few of the amenities. Escape 
was impossible: only an advanced 
technological civilization could pro- 
duce the complex fuel needed for the 
ship’s engines. And a brief aerial 
sui-vey had shown that the fifth 
planet, although a picturesque and 
inviting world, harbored no civiliza- 
tion— nor did it even give any sign of 
being inhabited by intelligent beings. 

By a simple cross-wiring proce- 
dure, Ichor prepared himself for the 
prospect of spending the rest of his 
lifespan in this place. He advised 
Detringer similarly to accept the in- 
evitable. After all, he pointed out, 
even if they did somehow obtain 
fuel, where would they go? The odds 
against their finding an advanced 
planetary civilization, even with a 
well-equipped exploration ship at 
their disposal, were astronomical. In 
a small vessel like the Sportster the 
attempt would be tantamount to 
suicide. 

Detringer was unimpressed by this 
reasoning. “Better to search and 
die,” he said, “than vegetate and 
live.” 

“Master,” Ichor pointed out re- 
spectfully, “that is heresy.” 

“I suppose it is,” Detringer said 
cheerfully. “But it is how I feel. And 
my intuition tells me that something 
will turn up.” 

Ichor shuddered and was glad for 



the sake of his master’s soul that, 
despite Detringer’s hopes, he was to 
receive the Unction of Perpetual Soli- 
tude. 

C APTAIN Edward Makepeace 
Macmillan stood in the main 
control room of the exploration ship 
Jenny Lind and scanned the tape as 
it came out of the 1100 Series 
Coordinating Computer. It was ap- 
parent that the new planet presented 
no dangers within the measuring 
ability of the ship’s instruments. 

Macmillan had come a long way to 
reach this moment. A brilliant life- 
sciences major at the University of 
Taos, Macmillan had gone on to do 
graduate work in Nucleonic Theory 
and Control. His doctoral thesis, 
titled Some Preliminary Notes on 
Certain Considerations Concerning 
the (Projected) Science of Interstellar 
Maneuvering, had been enthusiasti- 
cally accepted by his committee and 
had later been successfully pubUshed 
for the general public under the title. 
Lost and Found in Deepest Space. 
That, plus his long article in Nature, 
titled. The Use of Declension Theory 
in Spacecraft Landing Modalities, 
had made him the only possible 
choice to captain America’s first in- 
terstellar ship. 

He was a tall, handsome, strongly 
built man. His hair was prematurely 
flecked with gray, belying his thirty- 
six years. His reactions concerning 
navigation were quick and sure and 
his instinct for the integrity of his 
ship was awesome. 



A SUPPLIANT IN SPACE 



47 




Less awesome were his dealings 
with men. Macmillan was cursed with 
a certain shyness, a diffidence toward 
others, a knowledge of dubiety that 
sapped the decision-making process 
and that, however admirable it might 
be in a philosopher, was a potential 
weakness in a leader of men. 

A knock came at his door and 
Colonel Kettelman entered without 
bothering to be asked. “Looks good 
down there, hah?” he said. 

“The planetary profile is quite 
favorable,” Macmillan said stiffly. 

“That’s fine,” Kettelman said, 
staring uncomprehendingly at the 
computer tape. “Anything inter- 
esting about the place?” 

“A great deal,” Macmillan said. 
“Even a long-distance survey has 
shown what might well be some 
unique vegetable structures. Addi- 
tionally, our bacteria scan shows 
some anomalies, which—” 

“I didn’t mean that kind of stuff,” 
Kettelman said, evincing the natural 
indifference a career soldier some- 
times feels for bugs and plants. “I 
meant important stuff like alien 
armies and space fleets and Uke 
that.” 

“There is no sign of any civiliza- 
tion down there,” Macmillan said. “I 
doubt we will even find traces of 
intelligent life.” 

“Well, you can never tell,” Kettel- 
man said hopefully. He was a stocky, 
barrel-chested and unbending man. 
He was a veteran of the American 
Assistance Campaigns of ’34 and had 
fought as a major in the jungles of 



western Honduras in the so-called 
United Fruit War, emerging as a 
lieutenant colonel. He had received 
his full colonelcy during the ill-fated 
New York Insurrection, at which 
time he had personally led his men in 
storming the Subtreasury Building 
and then had held down the 42nd 
Street Line against the crack Gay 
Battalion. 

Utterly fearless, known as a sol- 
dier’s soldier, possessing an im- 
peccable combat record, wealthy in 
his own right, a friend of many U.S. 
Senators and Texas millionaires and 
not unintelligent, he had won the 
coveted appointment of Comman- 
dant of Military Operations aboard 
the Jenny Lind. 

Now he awaited the moment when 
he would lead his combat team of 
twenty Marines onto the surface of 
the fifth planet. The prospect hugely 
excited him. And, despite the instru- 
ment readings, Kettelman knew that 
anything might be down there wait- 
ing to strike and maim and kill— un- 
less he did so first, as he planned to 
do. 

“There is one thing,” Macmillan 
said. “We have detected a spacecraft 
on the surface of the planet.” 

“Ah,” Kettelman said. “I knew 
there’d be something. You spotted 
only one ship?” 

“Yes. A small one, displacing less 
than a twentieth the volume of our 
craft and apparently unarmed.” 

“That’s what they’d like you to 
believe, of course,” said Kettelman. 
“I wonder where the others are.” 



48 



GALAXY 




II 



“What others?” 

“The other alien spaceships and 
crews and ground-to-space weapons 
systems and all the rest of it, of 
course.” 

“The presence of one alien space- 
craft does not logically imply any 
other alien spacecraft,” Captain Mac- 
millan said. 

“No? Listen, Mac, I learned my 
logic in the jungles of Honduras,” 
Kettelman said. “The rule there was 
that if you found one runt with a 
machete you could be sure of finding 
another fifty or so hiding in the 
bushes, waiting to cut your ears off if 
you gave them a chance. You could 
get killed if you waited around for 
abstract proofs.” 

“The circumstances were some- 
what different,” Captain Macmillan 
pointed out. 

“So what does that matter?” 

Macmillan winced and turned 
away. Talking with Kettelman was 
painful for him and he avoided it as 
much as he could. The colonel was a 
disputatious individual, stubborn, 
easily driven to wrath and possessed 
of many positive opinions, most of 
which were founded upon a bedrock 
of nearly invincible ignorance. The 
captain knew that the antipathy be- 
tween himself and Kettelman was 
mutual. He was well aware that the 
colonel considered him an indecisive 
and ineffective person except per- 
haps in his special scientific areas. 

Luckily, their areas of command 
were sharply defined and delineated. 
Or had been to date. 



D ETRINGER and Ichor stood in a 
clump of trees and watched as 
the large alien spacecraft settled 
down to a faultless landing. 

“Whoever is piloting that ship,” 
Detringer said, “is a master pilot 
beyond compare. I would like to 
meet such a being.” 

“Doubtless you will get your 
chance,” Ichor said. “It is surely no 
accident that, given the entire surface 
of this planet to choose from, they 
have elected to put down almost 
beside us.” 

“They must have detected us, of 
course,” Detringer said. “And they 
have decided to take a bold line— 
exactly as I would do, given their 
position,” 

“That makes sense,” Ichor said. 
“But what will you do, given your 
position?” 

“Why, I’ll take a bold line, of 
course.” 

“This is a historic moment,” Ichor 
said. “A representative of the Fer- 
land people will soon meet the first 
intelligent aliens our race has ever 
encountered. How ironic that this 
opportunity should be vouchsafed to 
a criminal!” 

“The opportunity, as you call it, 
was forced upon me. I assure you 
that I did not seek it. And by the 
way— I think we will say nothing 
about my little differences with the 
Ferlang authorities.” 

“You mean you’re going to lie?” 
“That is a harsh way of putting 



A SUPPLIANT IN SPACE 



49 




it,” Detringer said. “Let us say that I 
am going to spare my people the 
embarrassment of having a criminal 
as their first emissary to an alien 
race.” 

“Well— I suppose that will be all 
right,” Ichor said. 

Detringer looked hard at his me- 
chanical servant. “It seems to me. 
Ichor, that you do not entirely ap- 
prove of my expediences.” 

“No, sir, I do not. But please 
understand; I am faithful to you 
without cavil. I would unhesitatingly 
sacrifice myself for your welfare at 
any moment. I will serve you unto 
death— and beyond, if that is 
possible. But loyalty to a person does 
not affect one’s religious, social and 
ethical beliefs. I love ^ou, sir— but I 
cannot approve of you.” 

“Well, then, I am warned,” Det- 
ringer said. “And now back to our 
alien friends. A port is opening. They 
are coming out.” 

“Soldiers are coming out,” Ichor 
said. 

The new arrivals were bipedal and 
also had two upper limbs. Each 
individual had only one head, one 
mouth and one nose, as had Det- 
ringer himself. They bore no visible 
tails or antennae. They were ob- 
viously soldiers to judge by the 
equipment they carried. Each in- 
dividual was heavily laden with what 
could be deduced to be projectile 
weapons, gas and explosive grenades, 
beam projectors, short-range atomics 
and much else besides. They wore 
personal armor and their heads were 



encased in clear plastic bubbles. 
There were twenty of them so 
equipped and one, obviously their 
leader, who had no visible weaponry. 
He carried a sort of whippy stick— 
probably a badge of office— with 
which he tapped himself on the 
upper left pedal appendage as he 
marched at the head of his soldiers. 

The soldiers advanced, well spread 
out, taking momentary concealment 
behind natural objects and posturally 
demonstrating an attitude of extreme 
suspicion and wariness. The officer 
walked directly forward without 
taking cover, his mien obviously por- 
traying nonchalance, bravado or stu- 
pidity. 

“I don’t think we should skulk 
around these bushes any longer,” 
Detringer said. “It is time for us to 
go forward and meet them with the 
dignity that befits an emissary of the 
Ferlang people.” 

He stepped forward immediately 
and strode toward the soldiers, 
followed by Ichor. Detringer was 
magnificent at that moment. 

E verybody on the jenny Lind 
knew about the alien spacecraft 
only a mile away. So it should have 
proven no surprise that the alien ship 
turned out to have had on board an 
alien who was at that moment ad- 
vancing boldly to meet Kettelman’s 
marines. 

But it did prove a surprise. No one 
was prepared to meet a genuine, 
honest-to-god, weird-looking alive- 
and-kicking alien. The occasion 



50 



GALAXY 




opened up too many imponderables. 
To name just one— what do’ you say 
when you finally meet an alien? How 
do you live up to the awesome 
historic quality of the moment? 
Whatever you come up with is going 
to sound like, Dr. Livingston, I pre- 
sume? People are going to laugh at 
you and your words— pompous or 
banal— for centuries. Meeting an alien 
has enormous potential for em- 
barrassment. 

Both Captain Macmillan and 
Colonel Kettelman were feverishly 
rehearsing opening lines and rejecting 
them and half-hoping that the C31 
Translating Computer would blow a 
transistor. The Marines were praying, 
Jesus, I hope he don ’t try to talk to 
me. Even the ship’s cook was think- 
ing, Christ, I suppose first thing out 
he’ll want to know all about what we 
eat. 

But Kettelman was in the lead. He 
thought. To hell with this-I’m not 
going to be the first to talk to him. 
He slowed down to let his men go 
ahead of him. But his men stopped 
in their tracks, waiting for the 
colonel. Captain Macmillan, standing 
just behind the marines, also stopped 
and wished that he hadn’t worn his 
full-dress uniform, complete with 
decorations. He was the most re- 
splendent man on the field and he 
just knew that the alien was going to 
walk straight over to him and begin 
talking. 

All the Terrans stood still. The 
alien continued to advance. Em- 
barrassment gave way to panic in the 



Terran ranks. The marines looked at 
the alien and thought, Jesus, what’s 
happening? They wavered, obviously 
on the verge of flight. Kettelman saw 
this and thought. They are going to 
disgrace the corps and me! 

The realization sobered him. 
Suddenly he remembered the news- 
men. Yes, the newsmen! Let the 
newsmen do it— that was what they 
were paid for. 

“Platoon, halt,” he called, then set 
his men at port arms. 

The. alien stopped, perhaps to see 
what was going on. 

“Captain,” Kettelman said to Mac- 
millan, “1 suggest that for this his- 
toric moment we unleash— I mean 
break out— the newsmen.” 

“An excellent suggestion.” Cap- 
tain Macmillan said and gave the 
order to take the newsmen out of 
stasis and bring them forth im- 
mediately. 

Then everybody waited until the 
newsmen came. 

T he newsmen were laid out in a 
special room. A sign on the door 
read: STASIS— No Admittance Ex- 
cept to Authorized Personnel. Hand-

to Be Awakened Except for Top 
Story. 

Within the room, each stretched 
out in his own capsule, were four 
newsmen and one newswoman. They 
had all agreed that it would be a 
waste of subjective time for them to 
live through the uneventful years 
required for the Jenny Lind to reach 



A SUPPLIANT IN SPACE 



51 




any destination at all. So they had all 
agreed to go into stasis freeze, with 
the understanding that they would 
be resuscitated immediately if any- 
thing newsworthy occurred. They 
left the decision as to what consti- 
tuted news to Captain Macmillan, 
who had worked as a reporter on the 
Phoenix Sun during his junior and 
sophomore years at the University of 
Taos. 

Ramon Delgado, a Scots engineer 
with a strange life story, received the 
order to wake up the newspeople. He 
made the necessary adjustments in 
their individual life -support systems. 
In fifteen minutes they were all 
somewhat groggily conscious and de- 
manding to know what was going on. 

“We’ve landed on a planet,” Del- 
gado said. “It’s an Earth-type place, 
but seems to support no civilization 
and no indigenous intelligent be- 
ings.” 

“You woke us up for that?” asked 
Quebrada of the Southeastern News 
Syndicate. 

“There’s more,” Delgado said. 
“There is an alien spaceship on this 
planet and we have contacted an 
intelligent alien.” 

“That’s more like it,” said Milli- 
cent Lopez of Woman’s Wear Daily 
and others. “Did you happen to 
notice what this alien is wearing?” 

“Could you ascertain how intelli- 
gent he is?” asked Mateos Upmann 
of the N. Y. Times and the L.A. 
Times. 

“What has he said so far?” asked 
Angel Potemkin of NBC-CBS-ABC. 



“He hasn’t said anything,” Engi- 
neer Delgado said. “Nobody has 
spoken to him yet.” 

“Do you mean to say,” said E. K. 
Quetzala of the Western News Syndi- 
cate, “that the first alien ever en- 
countered by the people of Earth is 
standing out there like a dope and 
nobody is interviewing him?” 

The newspeople rushed out, many 
of them still trailing tubes and wires, 
pausing only to pick up their re- 
corders from the Reporters’ Ready 
Room. Outside, blinking in strong 
sunlight, three of them picked up the 
C31 Translating Computer. They all 
rushed forward again, brushing Ma- 
rines aside, and surrounded the alien. 

Upmann turned on the C31, took 
one of its microphones and handed 
another to the alien, who hesitated a 
moment, then took it. 

“Testing, one two, three,” Up- 
mann said. “Did you understand 
what I said?” 

“You said, ‘Testing, one two, 
three,” Detringer said and everyone 
gave a sigh of relief for the first 
words had finally been spoken to 
Earthman’s first alien and Upmann 
was going to look like a real idiot in 
the history books. But Upmann 
didn’t care what he looked like as 
long as he was in the history books, 
so he went right on interviewing. 
And the others joined in. 

Detringer had to tell what he ate, 
how long and how often he slept, 
describe his sex life and its deviations 
from the Ferlang norm, his first 
impressions of Earthmen, his per- 



52 



GALAXY 




sonal philosophy, say how many 
wives he had and how he got along 
with them, how many children he 
had, how it felt to be him. He had to 
name his occupation, his hobbies, 
detail his interest or lack of interest 
in gardening, his recreations. He had 
to state whether he ever got intoxi- 
cated and in what manner, describe 
his extramarital sexual practices, if 
any, and what sort of sports he 
engaged in. He had to give his views 
on interstellar amity between intelli- 
gent races, discuss the advantages 
and/or disadvantages of having a tail, 
and much more. 

Captain Macmillan, now feeling a 
little ashamed of himself for neg- 
lecting his official duties, came for- 
ward and rescued the alien, who was 
bravely trying to explain the inex- 
plicable and making heavy work of 
it. 

Colonel Kettelman came too for 
he was, after all, in charge of security 
and it was his duty to penetrate 
deeply into the nature and intentions 
of the alien. 

There was a short clash of wills 
between these two officials concern- 
ing who should have the first meeting 
with Detringer, or whether it should 
be held jointly. It was finally decided 
that Macmillan, as symbolic represen- 
tative of the Earth peoples, should 
meet first with the alien. But it was 
understood that this would be a 
purely ceremonial meeting. Kettel- 
man would meet Detringer later and 
it was understood that that meeting 
would be action-oriented. 



That solved matters nicely and 
Detringer went off with Macmillan. 
The marines returned to the ship, 
stacked their arms and went back to 
polishing their boots. 

Ichor stayed behind. The news 
representative from Midwest News 
Briefs had grabbed him for an inter- 
view. This representative, Melchior 
Carrerra, was also commissioned to 
do articles for Popular Mechanics, 
Playboy, Rolling Stone and Automa- 
tion Engineers’ Digest. It was an 
interesting interview. 

D STRINGER’S talk with Captain 
Macmillan went very well. They 
shared relativistic outlooks on most 
things, both possessed natural tact 
and each was willing to attempt a 
-sympathetic understanding of a view- 
point not his own. They liked each 
other and Captain Macmillan felt 
with some astonishment that Det- 
ringer was less alien to him than was 
Colonel Kettelman. 

The interview with Kettelman, 
which followed immediately, was a 
different matter. Kettelman, after 
brief courtesies, got right down to 
business. 

“What are you doing here?” he 
asked. 

Detringer had been prepared for 
the necessity of explaining his situa- 
tion. He said, “I am an advance scout 
for the spatial forces of Ferlang. I 
was blown far off my course by a 
storm and put down here when my 
fuel ran out.”

“So you’re marooned.” 

“I am indeed. Temporarily, of 
course. As soon as my people can 
spare the necessary equipment and 
personnel and they will send out a 
relief ship to pick me up. But that 
could take quite a while. So if you 
wouldn’t mind letting me have a 

little fuel I would be deeply grate- 
ful.” 

“Hmmm,” said Colonel Kettel- 

man. 

“I beg your pardon?” 

“Hmmm,” said the C31 Trans- 

lating Computer, “is a polite sound 
made by Terraris to denote a short 
period of silent cogitation.” 

“That’s a lot of doubletalk,” 

Kettelman said. “‘Hmmm’ doesn’t 
mean anything at all. You say that 
you need fuel?” 

“Yes, Colonel, I do,” Detringer 
said. “From various external signs I 
believe that our propulsion systems 
are comparable.” 

“The propulsion system of the 
Jenny Lind—' began the C31 . 

“Wait a minute, that’s classified,” 
Kettelman said. 

“No, it’s not,” said the C31. 
“Everyone on Earth has been using 
the system for the last twenty years 
and it was officially declassified last 
year.” 

- “Hmmm,” said the colonel and 
looked unhappy as the C31 ex- 
plained the ship’s propulsion system. 

“Just as 1 thought,” Detringer 
said. “1 won’t even have to modify 
the formula. I can use your fuel just 
as it is. If you can spare any, that is.” 



“Oh, there’s no difficulty there,” 
Kettelman said. “We’ve got plenty. 
But I think we have a few things to 
talk over first.” 

“Like what?” Detringer said. 

“Like whether it would serve the 
interests of our security to give you 
the fuel.” 

“I fail to see any problem,” Det- 
ringer said. 

“It should be obvious. Ferlang is 
obviously a highly advanced tech- 
nological civilization. As such, you 
pose a potential threat to us.” 

“My dear Colonel, our planets are 
in different galaxies.” 

“So what? We Americans have 
always fought our wars as far from 
home as possible. Maybe you Fer- 
langs do the same. What does dis- 
tance matter, as long as you can get 
there at all?” 

Detringer controlled his temper 
and said, “We are peaceful people, 
defense-minded and deeply inter- 
ested in interstellar amity and co- 
operation.” 

“So you say,” Kettelman said. 
“But how can I be sure?” 

“Colonel,” Detringer said, “aren’t 
you being a little bit—” he fumbled 
for the right word, chose one that 
could not be Uterally translated— 
“urmuguahtt?” ^ 

The C31 supplied, “He wants to 
know if you aren’t being a little bit 
paranoid.” 

Kettelman bristled. Nothing got 
him angrier than when people im- 
plied he was paranoid. It made him 
feel persecuted. 



54 



GALAXY 




“Don’t get me sore,” he said omi- 
nously. “Now, suppose you tell me 
why I shouldn’t order you killed and 
every vestige of your ship destroyed 
in the interests of Earth security. By 
the time your people got here, we’d 
be long gone and the Ferlangers or 
whatever you call yourselves 
wouldn’t know a damned thing 
about us.” 

“That would be a possible course 
for you,” Detringer said, “were it not 
for the fact that I radioed my people 
as soon as I saw your ship and 
continued my broadcast right up to 
the moment I came out to meet you. 
I told Base Command all I could 
about you, including an educated 
guess as to the type of sun required 
for your physiques and another guess 
as to the direction your world lies in, 
based upon ion-trail analysis.” 

“You are a clever fellow, aren’t 
you?” Kettelman said peevishly. 

“I also told my people that I was 
going to request some fuel from your 
obviously copious stores. I suppose 
they would account it an extremely 
unfriendly act if you refused me this 
favor.” 

“I never thought of that,” Kettel- 
man said. “Hmmm. I am under 
orders not to provoke an interstellar 
incident—” 

“So?” Detringer asked and waited. 

There was a long, uncomfortable 
silence. Kettelman hated the thought 
of giving what amounted to military 
assistance to a being who might be 
his next enemy. But there seemed no 
way around it. 



“All right,” he said at last. “I’ll 
send the fuel over tomorrow.” 

Detringer thanked him and talked 
quite openly and frankly about tbe 
enormous size and complex wea- 
ponry of the Ferlang interspatial 
armed forces. He exaggerated some- 
what. In fact, not one word did he 
say that was true. 



Ill 

E arly in the morning a human 
came over to Det ringer’s ship 
carrying a canister of fuel. Detringer 
told him to set it down anywhere, 
but the human insisted upon carrying 
it personally through the Sportster’s 
tiny cabin and pouring it into the 
fuel tank. Those were the colonel’s 
orders, he said. 

“Well, that’s a beginning,” Det- 
ringer said to Ichor. “Only about 
sixty more cans to go.” 

“But why are they sending them 
one at a time?” Ichor asked. “Surely 
that is inefficient.” 

“Not necessarily. It depends what 
Kettelman is hoping to achieve.” 
“What do you mean?” Ichor 
asked. 

“Nothing, I hope. Let’s wait and 
see.” 

They waited and long hours 
passed. At last evening came, but no 
more fuel had been sent over. Det- 
ringer walked over to the Terran 
ship. Brushing the reporters aside, he 
requested an interview with Kettel- 
man. 



A SUPPLIANT IN SPACE

An orderly led him to the 
colonel’s quarters. The room was 
simply furnished. On the walls were a 
few mementos— two rows ^^f medals 
mounted on black velvet in a solid 
gold frame, a photograph qf a Dober- 
man Pinscher with fangs Sired, and a 
shrunken head taken duringdhe Seige 
of Tegulcigapa. The colonfel himself, 
stripped down to khaki sKorts, was 
squeezing a rubber ball in feach hand 
and one in each foot. 

“Yes, Detringer, what can I do for 
you?” Kettelman asked. 

“I came to ask you why you have 
stopped sending the fuel.” 

“Have you, now?” Kettelman re- 
leased all the rubber balls and sat 
down in a leather-backed director’s 
chair with his name stenciled on it. 
“Well, I’ll answer that by asking you 
a question. Detringer, how did you 
manage to send radio messages to 
your people without any radio equip- 
ment?” 

“Who says I have no radio equip- 
ment?” Detringer asked. 

“I sent Engineer Delgado over 
with that first can of fuel,” 
Kettelman said. “He was under 
orders to see what sort of rig you 
were using. He told me that there 
were no signs of radio equipment in 
your ship. Engineer Delgado is an. 
expert on that sort of thing.” 

“We miniaturize oqr equipment,” 
Detringer said. 

“So do we. But it still requires a 
lot of hardware, which you don’t 
seem to have. I might add that we 
have been listening on all wave- 



lengths ever since we came close to 
this planet. We have detected no 
transmissions of any kind.” 

Detringer sa4d, “I can explain all 
of that.” 

“Please do so.” 

“It’s simple enough. I lied to 
you.” 

“That much is evident. But it 
explains nothing.” 

“I wasn’t finished. We Ferlangi 
have our security too, you know. 
Until we know more about you, it is 
only common sense to reveal as little 
about ourselves as possible. If you 
were gullible enough to believe that 
we relied on so primitive a system of 
communication as radio, it might be 
a small advantage for us in case we 
ever met again under unfriendly cir- 
cumstances.” 

“So how do you communicate? Or 
don’t you?” 

Detringer hesitated, then said, “I 
suppose it doesn’t matter if I tell 
you. You were bound to find out 
sooner or later that my species is 
telepathic.” 

“Telepathic? You are claiming 
that you can send and receive 
thoughts?” 

“That is correct,” Detringer said. 

Kettelman stared at him for a 
moment, then said, “Okay, what am I 
thinking now?” 

“You’re thinking that I’m a liar,” 
Detringer said. 

“That’s right,” Kettelman said. 

“But that was obvious and I didn’t 
learn that by reading your mind. You 
see, we Ferlangi are telepathic only 



56 



GALAXY 




among members of our species.” 

“Do you know something?” 
Colonel Kettelman said. “I still think 
you’re a damned liar.” 

“Of course,” Detringer said. “The 
question is, can you be sure?” 

“I’m damned sure,” Kettelman 
said grimly. 

“But is that good enough? For the 
requirements of your security, I 
mean? Consider— if I am telling the 
truth, then yesterday’s reasons for 
your giving me fuel are equally valid 
today. Do you agree?” 

The colonel nodded grudgingly. 
“Whereas, if I’m lying and you 
give me fuel, no harm will be done. 
You will have helped a fellow being 
in distress, thus putting my people 
and myself in your debt. That would 
be a promising way to begin the 
relationship between us. And, with 
both our races pushing out into deep 
space, it is inevitable that our people 
will meet again.” 

“I suppose it is inevitable,” Kettel- 
man said. “But I can maroon you 
here and postpone official contact 
until we are better prepared.” 

“You can try to postpone the next 
contact,” Detringer said. “But it still 
could happen at any time. Now is 
your chance to make a good be- 
ginning. The next time might not be 
so auspicious.” 

“Hmmm,” Kettelman said. 

“So there are good reasons for 
helping me even if I am lying,” 
Detringer said. “And remember, I 
may be telling the truth. In that case, 
your refusing me fuel would have to 



be considered an extremely unfriend- 
ly act.” 

The colonel paced up and down 
the narrow room, then whirled and 
in a fury said, “You argue too 
damned well!” 

“It is just my good luck,” Det- 
ringer said, “that logic happens to be 
on my side.” 

“He’s right, you know,” said the 
C31 Translating Computer. “About 
the logic, I mean.” 

“Shut up!” 

“I thought it was my duty to 
point that out,” the C31 said. 

The colonel stopped pacing and 
rubbed his forehead. “Detringer, go 
away,” he said wearily. “I’ll send 
over the fuel.” 

“You won’t regret it,” Detringer 
said. 

“I regret it already,” Kettelman 
said. “Now please go away.” 

ETRINGER hurried back to his 
ship and told Icher the good 
news. The robot was surprised. “I 
didn’t think he would do it,” he said. 

“He didn’t think so, either,” Det- 
ringer said. “But I managed to con- 
vince him.” He told Ichor of his 
conversation with the colonel. 

“So you lied,” Ichor said sadly. 

“Yes. But Kettelman knows I 
Tied.” 

“Then why is he helping you?” 

“Out of fear that I just might be 
telling the truth.” 

“Lying is both a sin and a crime, 
Master.” 

“But letting myself stay in this 




A SUPPLIANT IN SPACE 



57 




place is something worse.” Detringer 
said. “It would be gross stupidity.” 
“That is not an orthodox view.” 
“Perhaps it would be just as well 
for us not to discuss orthodoxy any 
longer,” Detringer said. “Now I’ve 
got some work to do. Suppose you 
go out and see if you can find me 
anything to eat.” 

The servant silently obeyed and 
Detringer sat down with a star atlas 
in hope of figuring out where to go, 
assuming he could go anywhere. 

M orning came, bright and re- 
splendent. Ichor went over to 
the Earth ship to play chess with the 
robot dishwasher with whom he had 
struck up an acquaintance the pre- 
vious day. Detringer waited for the 
fuel. 

He was not entirely surprised 
when noon came and no fuel had 
been sent over. But he was disap- 
pointed and dejected. He waited an- 
other two hours, then walked over to 
the Jenny Lind. 

He had been expected, so it 
seemed, for he was led at once to the 
officers’ lounge. Colonel Kettelman 
was seated in a deep armchair. An 
armed marine flanked him on each 
side. The colonel’s expression was 
stern, but there was a nimbus of 
malevolent joy playing about his 
battered features. Seated nearby was 
Captain Macmillan, his handsome 
face unreadable. 

“Well, Detringer,” the colonel 
said, “What is it this time?” 



“I came to ask about the fuel you 
promised me,” Detringer said. “But I 
see now that you had no intention of 
keeping your word.” 

“You got me all wrong,” the 
colonel said. “I had every intention 
of giving fuel to a member of the 
Armed Forces of Ferlang. But what I 
see before me is not the person at 
all.” 

“Whom do you see, then?” Det- 
ringer asked. 

Kettelman stifled an ugly grin. 
“Why, I see a criminal, so judged by 
his own people’s highest court. I see 
a felon whose evil acts were con- 
sidered unprecedented in the annals 
of modern Ferlang jurisprudence. I 
see a being whose unspeakable be- 
havior earned him the most extreme 
sentence known to his people— 
namely. Perpetual Banishment into 
the depths of space. That’s whom I 
see standing before me. Or do you 
deny it?” 

“For the moment, I neither deny 
nor affirm,” Detringer said. “I would 
first like to know the source of your 
remarkable information.” 

Colonel Kettelman nodded to one 
of the marines. The soldier opened a 
door and led in Ichor, followed by 
the robot dishwasher. 

The mechanical servant burst out, 
“Oh Master! I told Colonel Kettel- 
man the true account of the events 
leading up to our exile on this planet. 
And now I have doomed you! I beg 
the privilege of immediate auto-de- 
struct in partial reparation for my 
disloyalty.” 



58 



GALAXY 




Detringer was silent, thinking 
furiously. Captain Macmillan leaned 
forward and asked, “Ichor, why did 
you betray your master?” 

“I had no choice. Captain!” the 
miserable mechanical cried. “Before 
the Ferlang authorities allowed me to 
accompany my master they im- 
printed certain orders upon my 
brain. These they reinforced with 
devious circuitry.” 

“What were the orders?” 

“They pertained to the covert role 
of policeman and gaoler which the 
authorities forced upon me. They 
demanded that I take appropriate 
action, should Detringer, by some 
miracle, find himself able to escape 
his just desserts.” 

The robot dishwasher burst out. 



“He told me all about it yesterday. 
Captain. I begged him to resist his 
orders. It all seemed to me rather a 
bad show, sir, if you know what I 
mean.” 

“And indeed, I did resist for as 
long as I could,” Ichor said. “But as 
my masters’ chances for escape be- 
came imminent my compulsion to 
prevent it became more imperative. 
Only an immediate excision of the 
special circuits could have stopped 
me.” 

The robot dishwasher said, “I 
offered to try to operate on him, sir, 
though the only tools in my posses- 
sion were spoons, knives and forks.” 

Ichor said, “I would have gladly 
undergone the operation— indeed, I 
wanted to destroy myself, thus pre-

venting any word from escaping my 
involuntarily treacherous voicebox. 
But the Ferlang authorities had con- 
sidered these possibilities, and I was 
under compulsion not to allow my- 
self willingly to be tampered with or 
destroyed until I had done the 
State’s bidding. Yet I resisted until 
this morning and then, my strength 
drained away through value-conflict, 
I came to Colonel Kettelman and 
told all.” 

“And there you have the whole 
sordid story,” Kettelman said to the 
captain. 

“Not quite all,” Captain Mac- 
millan said quietly. “What exactly 
were your crimes, Detringer?” 

Detringer recited them in a steady 
voice— his Acts of Incredible Cross- 
ness, his offense of Willful Dis- 
obedience and his final Act of Overt 
Malevolent Violence. Ichor nodded 
in forlorn agreement. 

“1 think we have heard enough,” 
Kettelman said. “I will now pro- 
nounce judgment upon this case.” 

“One moment. Colonel,” said Cap- 
tain Macmillan. He turned to Det- 
ringer. “Are you now, or have you at 
any time been, a member of the 
Armed Forces of Ferlang?” 

“No,” Detringer said and Ichor 
corroborated his statement. 

“Then this being is a civilian,” 
Captain Macmillan said, “and must 
be judged and sentenced by a civilian 
authority rather than a military 
one.” 

“Well, I don’t know about that,” 
Kettelman said. 



“The position is quite clear,” Cap- 
tain Macmillan said. “He is a civilian 
under sentence by a civilian court. 
No state of war exists between his 
people and ours. His case, therefore, 
is not a military matter.” 

“I still think I should handle this,” 
Kettelman said. “I know more about 
these matters than you do, sir— with 
all due respect.” 

“I wUl judge this matter,” Mac- 
millan said. “Unless you wish to take 
over the command of this ship by 
force of arms.” 

Kettelman shook his head. “I’m 
not going to put any black mark on 
my record. Go ahead and sentence 
him.” 

Captain Macmillan turned to Det- 
ringer. “Sir,” he said, “you must 
understand that I cannot follow my 
personal inclinations in this matter. 
Your State has judged you and it 
would be ill-advised, impertinent and 
unpolitic of me to rescind that judg- 
ment.” 

“Damn right,” Kettelman said. 

“Therefore I continue your sen- 
tence of perpetual exile. But I shall 
enforce it more stringently than has 
been done heretofore.” 

The colonel grinned. Ichor made a 
despairing sound. The robot dish- 
washer murmured, “Poor fellow!” 
Detringer stood firmly and gazed 
unwaveringly at the captain. 

Macmillan said, “If is the judg- 
ment of this court that the prisoner 
continue his exile. Furthermore, the 
court rules that the prisoner’s so- 
journ on this pleasant planet is an 



60 



GALAXY 




amenity unintended by the Ferlang 
authorities. Therefore, E>etringer, 
you must quit this refuge im- 
mediately and return to the empty 
fastnesses of space.” 

“That’s socking it to him,” 
Colonel Kettelman said. “You know, 
Captain, I really didn’t think you had 
it in you.” 

“I’m glad that you approve,” Cap- 
tain Macmillan said. “I hereby re- 
quest that you see the sentence 
carried out.” 

“It’ll be a pleasure.” 

“By using all of your men,” Mac- 
millan went on, “I calculate that you 
can fill the prisoner’s fuel tanks in 
approximately two hours. After that 
is done, the prisoner must leave this 
planet at once.” 

“I’ll get him moving before night- 
fall,” Kettelman said. Then a thought 
occurred to him. “Hey! Fuel for his 
tanks? That’s what Detringer wanted 
all along.” 

“The court is disinterested in what 
the prisoner may or may not have 
wanted,” Macmillan said. “His de- 
sires are not germane to the judg- 
ment of this court.” 

Kettelman said, “But damn it, 
man, can’t you see that you’re letting 
him go?” 

“I am making him go,” Macmillan 
said. “It is quite a different thing.” 
“We’U see what they say about 
this back on Earth,” Kettelman said 
ominously. 

Detringer bowed to show acquies- 
cence. Then, managing to keep a 
straight face, he left the Earth ship. 



y^T NIGHTFALL Detringer blasted 
x\. off. The faithful Ichor was with 
him— now more faithful than ever, 
since he had discharged his compul- 
sion. Soon they were in the depths of 
space and Ichor asked, “Master, 
where are we going?” 

“To some marvelous new world,” 
Detringer said. 

“Or perhaps to our deaths?” 

“Perhaps,” Detringer said. “But 
with full fuel tanks I refuse to 
worry.” 

They were silent for a while. Then 
Ichor said, “I hope that Captain 
Macmillan doesn’t get into trouble 
over this.” 

“He seemed quite capable of 
taking care of himself,” Detringer 
said. 

B ack on Earth, Captain Mac- 
millan’s action was the cause of 
much controversy. Before any offi- 
cial decision could be reached about 
it, however, a second, official contact 
was made between Ferlang and 
Earth. The Detringer case came up 
inevitably, was found too intricate to 
allow of any quick decision. The 
matter was turned over to a panel of 
jurists from the two civilizations.

If man and woman were to 
survive— as they felt they 
must— they first had to demon- 
strate in alien (non-Earth) 
places that they were capable 
of off-Earth conception, gesta- 
tion and delivery of normal 
progeny. 

One of the tasks of May- 
flower Two was to achieve two 
lunar conceptions. No one 
know, after aU, how such an 
affair would go. Ova, sperma- 
tozoa, chromosomes, genes, all 
weightless or relatively so. (The 
real weightlessness of outer 
space could wait— first lASA 




wanted to try perpetuation, or 
at least conception, of the 
species in lunar gravity.) Con- 
sensus was that lunar gravity 
wouldn’t make any difference, 
but the decision-makers had to 
find out.

46'|\>fISSION CONTROL from 

\yXStork:' 

“Roger, Gary.” 

“As your consoles will have told 
you. Stork has landed. Right on the 
money, I might add. We’re about 
twenty yards from what’s left of 
Pearl Harbor. ” 

“We copy that. Congratulations to 
all.” 

“The dome is collapsed, as ex- 
pected.” 

“Roger. We’re about a minute off 
the line, Gary. Suggest you initiate 
module checkout at this time.” 

“Wm do.” 

“Gary?” This was Don Newsome, 
in orbit in Chimney I. Chimney II 
would pick this crew up in twenty- 
nine days. The crew hadn’t chosen 
the names of the components. 

“Roger, Don.” 

“I’ll be leaving you shortly. I 
know you got wine down there and 
like that, but remember you ’sposed 
to work too.” 

“Okay, Don. I know you and 
Clara wanted to be here. We wish 



you were, as a matter of fact. We’ll 
do what we’re supposed to, Don. 
Good trip back.” 

“Right on, Gary. And Kathy and 
Bev and Ron. See you birds back on 
terra firma.” 

They broke contact and the crew 
of Mayflower Two got to work. 

T here had been the obvious 
jokes, of course, mostly crude 
and lamentably lacking in imagina- 
tion. References to potency, fertility, 
swapping and so on. The general 
public wasn’t supposed to be aware 
of the prime mission of Mayflower 
Two, but the word had gotten out. 
The four participants had taken this 
in reasonably good humor. They had, 
after all, been rigorously screened on 
all relevant parameters. 

As it came about, the crew of 
Mayflower Two was a curiosity— it 
was strictly WASP, in sharp contrast 
to the diverse crews of Mayflower 
One and the already-crewed May- 
flower Three. There had been some 
criticism on racial grounds, but you 
can’t argue with the computer any* 
more than you can with City HaU. 

Computer input: ob-gyn his- 
tories, sperm counts, multi- 
phasic profiles of many inter- 
esting human variables, psy- 
chiatric evaluations and predic- 
tions, compatibility ratings and 
personality extrapolations. No 
one knew what personahty ex- 
trapolations were except their 
constructor, a hitherto obscure

behavioral person, one Dr. A. 
Fulcher, and he wouldn’t say 
anything— he did seem to know 
how to tell the programers 
which keys to punch. 

Also into the computer went 
everything that could be said 
about academic background, 
achievement and publication, 
since everyone considered for 
the mission was a physical 
scientist of one stripe or an- 
other. Pilot proficiency, simu- 
lation performance and train- 
ing records, down to the last 
decimal. 

I N SHORT, the lot. WeU, ahnost 
the lot. 

Not into the computer: marital 
status. This had been predetermined. 
The power of pubUc opinion, plus 
the power of the Congress of the 
United States and other funding en- 
tities, was such that it was manda- 
tory that the Mayflower Two crew 
comprise two lawfully wedded 
couples. Everyone whose data went 
into the computer was married to 
someone whose data were also spun 
off into that monster. The per- 
missivity index was declining. Jokes 
or no, there wasn’t supposed to be 
any hanky-panky, no swapping, on 
the moon. 

Computer output: Ronald 
Watson. Twenty-eight-year-old 
white male from Albuquerque. 
Mineralogist. Long blond hair, 
the body of a discus thrower 



and a taste for wine, of which 
he knows quite a bit. The only 
astronaut, ever, to be a mem- 
ber of Les Chevaliers du Taste- 
vin. 

Kathleen Townsend Watson. 
Twenty -eight-year-old white fe- 
male from Phoenix. Short 
blond hair and the body of a 
figure skater, which she is not. 
She is a radio interferometrist. 

Beverly Webb Brooks. 
Thirty-two, the oldest of the 
crew. Biomedicine, M.D., Ph.D. 
Wavy dark hair and dimples. 
Her figure is that of Mother 
Earth, reduced to five feet 
eight, a hundred and sixty, and 
38 - 2840 . 

Gary Brooks. Thirty-one and 
a seismologist. His figure is that 
of a player of chess, a game of 
which he knows nothing. StUl, 
the computer has pulled him 
through. The commander of 
the mission has, as usual, been 
selected by lot, and he is it. 

T hey suited up and cracked the 
hatch. Again, for four people, 
the uncommunicable experience of 
stepping slowly and awkwardly down 
the ladder and onto the lunar sur- 
face. They inflated the dome and 
entered through the air lock. 

“Why, it’s neat as a pin,” Kathleen 
said. “Teiko said to excuse the mess 
they’d left.” 

“Her mess is our neatness,” Bev- 
erly said. These women knew each 
other well— they had been into each 



MAYFLOWER TWO

others’ houses, kitchens. Now two of 
them were setting up housekeeping 
in a place one (with others) had lived 
in before. An odd feeling. 

First they set out the solar ac- 
cumulators, then spent the after- 
noon— the local afternoon, not the 
lunar— bringing in the first lot of 
supplies, doing the things people do 
whenever they move into any place. 
On Earth or Luna, into apartment, 
motel, house or dome, the basics are 
the same. Get the things you need 
inside and get on with the business of 
getting ready for the night. 

Getting ready for the night. 

The matter of privacy had come 
up in the mission, as it had in 
preceding ones and would in those to 
follow. The Mayflower Two crew set 
up their new arrangement in living by 
trisecting the dome. One sector for 
the Watsons, one for the Brooks’s 
and one in common. The partitions 
were translucent. They hadn’t 
wanted transparency, but they had 
rejected the bleakness of opacity. 
Shadowy movement would be re- 
assuringly visible from one side to 
the other. 

During the local day the partitions 
between the living places (or the 
sleeping places) would, they thought, 
be drawn aside. This would make the 
dome a relatively airy and spacious 
place. They would take their meals in 
the common room. And play bridge 
(a far-out outpost of suburbia here) 
and poker. Their mutual interest in 
these games had, of course, been part 
of the Computer input. 



They were busy the first day, with 
so much to transfer from the module 
into the dome and the accumulators 
to deploy. Ronald Watson’s first job 
was to carry to the dome, with great 
care, the few bottles of very good 
wine. These could not remain outside 
for any time at all. And they all 
carried in food, sleeping bags, parti- 
tions, portable toilet, water, decks of 
cards, poker chips, communications 
gear . Gary meticulously checking 
item after item in the big book. 

Time for dinner at last, though the 
sun was high. Beverly and Kathleen 
set up the table and Ronald cere- 
moniously opened the ritual bottle 
of wine. Clos de Tart, nineteen 
ninety -three. 

Gary Brooks busied himself in the 
Brooks quarters, his back to the 
common room. 

“What do you say for your first 
dinner on the moon?” Beverly asked 
Kathleen. “Come and get it? Soup’s 
on? It’s not soup, but it’s on. Come 
and get it,” she said. 

Gary Brooks did not adjust to 
lunar gravity as gracefully as the 
others, and he now loped awkwardly 
towatd the table, upon wliich he 
placed two tall yellow candles, which 
he had fixed into holders. He pro- 
ceeded to light the candles. 

“I will be damned.” said Kathleen. 
“Are we having candlelight and wine 
way up here on the moon?” 

“Well, yes,” said Gary, thought- 
ful smile on his face. “Though it’s 
broad lunar day and I know that. I 
also knew Ron would have wine 



66 



GALAXY 




tonight and I— well— I want candle- 
light and wine, AU right?” 

Beverly kissed her hus^nd. “You 
brought them in your PPP.” 

“1 did. In my tidy little Personal 
Preference Package, yes. Among 
other things. 1 wonder what the rest 
of you have in yours. I’ve no idea 
what Bev has in hers.” 

“No doubt we’ll find out as time 
goes on.” 

“That was sweet of you, Gary,” 
Beverly said, the candles flickering 
over the table. They threw no light at 
all into the glary day, but the flames 
were visible, wavering there, saying 
something. 

“Actually, when 1 decided to bring 
them 1 was thinking of the night. 
They’ll be nice then. But this is a 
special occasion.” 

The amenities of Mayflower Two 
included a modicum of music, music 
of their choice. There was always 
Houston and the radio, but they also 
had a tape deck with eight cassettes, 
two chosen by each crew member. 
Gary put on one of his, a sentimental 
melange from the late eighties. 

The rations were standard IAS A, 
but the wine wasn’t. Ronald was 
suitably grave dispensing it. A special 
occasion with music there, candles 
burning in the sunlight, and a first 
dinner on the moon. 

They aU cleaned up afterward, 
even as in Bronxville or Brookljne, 
though the problems weren’t quite 
the same. 

“A rubber of bridge before bed?” 
Gary asked. “Some hands of poker?” 



The rules of the game, games, had 
been set forth before liftoff. Scores 
would cumulate until the end of the 
mission. Stakes would be reasonable, 
but significantly different from zero. 
Debts would be settled upon return 
to Earth. In bridge the married 
couples would be partners. In poker 
(as always) each to his own. These 
were aU gamespeople, which datum 
had not escaped the computer’s 
notice. 

“I’m tired,” Ronald Watson said, 
“but let’s have a rubber or two of 
bridge to get a score started.” 

They began the first bridge game 
on the moon. 

Logistics; Or, swearing by 
the constant moon. 

All lunar missions are neces- 
sarily tied to what the moon is 
doing, where it is in relation to 
what terrestrial feature, how 
far it is from Earth, where the 
desired landing site is, and so 
on. Mayflower Two was tied to 
the lunar cycle in more ways 
than these. 

Beverly Brooks’s and Kath- 
leen Watson’s menstrual cycles 
had been regulated on Earth as 
close to the precision of WWV 
as had been possible. Stork had 
landed as near lunar midday as 
technology allowed. The two 
menstrual cycles in question 
had peaked in translunar trajec- 
tory. The weeping of the red 
mucosa was supposed to cease 
on or about their second day 



MAYFLOWER TWO

on the lunar surface. This all 
fitted together into a neat for- 
mula which dictated that the 
two ovulations would take 
place at or close to the lunar 
midnight. There ’d been no op- 
tions here. Mission Design had 
said how the cycles would go 
and that had been that. The 
subject-participants had raised 
no objections— the Mission De- 
sign arrangement had seemed 
desirable to them also. 

There had been more than 
enough briefing. The May- 
flower Two crew had been 
told, for example, that if the 
most potent and spermatozoic 
male and the world champion 
fertile willing female mated 
morning, noon, and night, they 
would never, never conceive, 
since there would be no time, 
in the midst of all that, for the 
sperm count to get high 
enough— as had been shown 
often enough in the literature. 

And there had been briefing 
along other related lines— 
though after Pegasus Two and 
Pegasus Four and Mayflower 
One some intelligence was be- 
ginning to seep into the aware- 
ness of Mission Design to the 
effect that events on lunar 
missions were not entirely 
within their control. Thus 
Beverly and Gary and Ronald 
and Kathleen had no rigid 
timetable that scheduled the 
achievement of their prime ob- 



jective, but they did have 
something Hke guidelines. 

None of which had much 
relevance the first night. 

44T TOW’S it going?” Gary asked 

T This wife. 

The dome was quiet now and 
there was a feeling of night about it, 
though the sun was overhead. Some 
shade was provided by movable 
sheets of opaque mylarplex, a con- 
venience Mayflower One hadn’t had. 
There was quiet background music, 
one of Kathleen’s cassettes endlessly 
repeating. Voices were low and there 
was at least a simulation of an 
approach to privacy. 

“I’m about finished. Be through 
tomorrow, I think. Right on sked.” 

Sleeping bags on the floor of the 
dome and heads in the shadows. 

See it this way: 

Screen very dark, shadows vaguely 
moving. 

Gary: Our first night on the moon. 

Beverly: Yes. And it’s so bright. 
But it seems Uke night, somehow. 

Close shot: a dimly seen blur of 
activity where the sleeping bags are. 
Nothing heard over the background 
until: 

Gary: I’d better take this out. 

Beverly: Yes. Here, I’ll do it. 

Middle shot: dark screen with 
shadowy shapes, this holding for an 
unidentifiable length of time. 

Gary: The gravity makes it differ- 
ent, doesn’t it? 

Beverly: It do. That was sweet. I

guess we’re in training. Good night, 
Gary-person. 

Music self-destructs and the dome 
is silent. 

II 

W ORK to do, and getting on 
with it the next day. 

Kathleen Watson’s business is 
radio interferometry. Upon the sur- 
face of the moon she will set up two 
transmitters and two receivers, these 
four units placed at precisely mea- 
sured distances from each other. This 
apparatus will be in two-way com- 
munication with a similar lashup on 
Earth, though the distances there 
between units wiU be much greater. 
Thus more will be learned abouf 
earth-moon distance, lunar libra tion 
and the like. 

Gary Brooks, the seismologist with 
the chess-player physique, will set up 
recording equipment here and ex- 
plosive charges there, in aid of deter- 
mining, via shock waves, the effect of 
the latter upon the former, thus 
extending our knowledge of the 
inner nature of the moon. 

The mineralogist, oenophile 
Ronald Watson, will gather rocks for 
subsequent study on Earth. There 
hasn’t been a lunar mission yet that 
hasn’t collected rocks and Mayflower 
Two wiU be no exception. (The 
search, each mission, becomes more 
sophisticated.) 

These three crew members wiU, 
during the sunUt days, keep the rover 
quite busy. 



Mother Earth Beverly Brooks is 
the medical person. She wiU perform 
numerous analyses upon the crew, 
including herself, and wiU conduct 
obscure experiments concerned with 
viruses, phagi and bacteria upon the 
lunar surface. The most important 
component of her gear is one of the 
first two ovulometers on the moon. 
Kathleen has the other. 

An ovulometer is, for aU of that, a 
simple device: a thermometer of par- 
ticular construction and scale whose 
purpose is to pinpoint the time of 
ovulation. Other means are available 
and wfll be there for backup, but the 
ovulometer is old reUable— and be- 
sides, it weighs almost nothing. 

The first fuU day on the moon, 
then. The crew of Mayflower Two 
breakfasted; deployed the rover 
(which worked weU right off); set 
about their respective scientific pro- 
grams; dined (no wine, no candle- 
light); and played poker for two 
hours (Gary Brooks losing, Ronald 
Watson winning, the women about 
even). 

The second day differed from the 
first principaUy in that Beverly and 
Kathleen took the first of their basal 
temperatures— which is to say that, 
before rising, they inserted the ovu- 
lometers and, after waiting no less 
than four minutes, read what they 
said. These values Beverly plotted 
upon coordinate paper, one point on 
each of two sheets, these points 
comprising the beginnings of two 
curves crucial to the success of the 
mission. Day two also differed in 



MAYFLOWER TWO 



69 




that the rover was already deployed, 
so they didn’t have to spend two 
hours doing that. And instead of 
poker they played bridge that eve- 
ning (Brooks team aliead by a 
modest margin). 

S CIENTIFIC work going on and 
the sun lower every day as the 
terminator approached. It arrived on 
the seventh day with predicted, but 
startling, suddenness. Nor was the 
change altogether physical. Night was 
one moment there and the next 
moment here and, as always, the 
intradome ambience shifted, ch^ged 
from one complex set of orientations 
to another. 

Kathleen Watson’s interferometric 
experiments would continue, but by 
remote control. Ronald Watson 
wouldn’t be looking for rocks in the 
dark. Gary Brooks’s shocking experi- 
ments were over until the lunar 
dawn. Beverly had nothing to do 
outside. 

Thus, they were all scheduled to 
remain within the dome for the next 
fourteen local days— the mission cul- 
minating, so to speak, on the sixth, 
seventh or eighth day (night) -after 
the hasty passage of the terminator, 
the specific time to be determined by 
internal events, telltold by ovulom- 
eters. 

Candlelight and wine appeared 
again within the dome, this time the 
candles making sense, belonging 
there, creating a sense of coziness to 
moon-people (had there been any) 



looking in from the outside. 

“I said it would be nice at night,” 
Gary said. “And it is.” 

“It is. And the wine,” Ronald said, 
“is far from mediocre. The first 
bottle of Petrus on the moon. To the 
mission,” he said, raising his glass. 

They drank to that and to a few 
other things and they cleaned up and 
got ready to play. 

“It’s going to be a long night.” 
Ronald said. “We’ve done our bit for 
lASA— as much as we can at the 
moment— so now we can relax and 
do things for us. Play games— bridge, 
poker— drink such little— but very 
good— wine as we have.” 

“Enjoy ourselves,” Kathleen said. 
“Prepare for midnight.” 

“Read. And sleep long hours,” 
said Beverly. “Lie lazily in late 
morning looking at Earth up there. 
Sometimes I want to reach out and 
touch it. You know?” 

“Make money playing poker,” 
Gary said. “I’m down. Down in 
poker, I mean. But I’m up in bridge. 
And read, yes. As for touching the 
earth. I’ll do that when we get back. 
I can’t do it from here.” 

Gary pinched out the candles to 
save them and turned on two lights. 

“Which game tonight, then?” 
Kathleen asked. 

There was the obvious difference. 
In bridge it was two against two, one 
partnership against the other. In 
poker it was dog eat dog. 

“Bridge?” Beverly. 

Ronald glanced at Kathleen. “All 
right,” he said.

GALAXY 




They set up the table. It was a 
quiet game and they finished about 
even. 



The guidelines for the 
crucial aspect of the Mayflower 
Two mission were more sug- 
gestive than mandatory— which 
showed uncommon common 
sense on the part of Mission 
Design. The women would ovu- 
late come what may, but what 
would happen within the testes 
of the men consisted, to a 
degree, of controllable vari- 
ables. Too-frequent expendi- 
ture would lower the count to 
the point of sterility and lASA 
would not approve of that. On 
the other hand, use it or lose it. 
Between extremes, then, were 
optimal performances— or, 
more correctly, optimal layoffs 
between performances. These 
had been determined for Gary 
Brooks and for Ronald Watson 
by indelicate but necessary 
means. Thus the couples had 
been proved with some direc- 
tion, but no coercion. Mission 
Design wasn’t about to say. Do 
this on this day and that on the 
third one after and like that, 
which could easily, if not pre- 
dictably, have led to diffi- 
culties. The whole thing was 
dicey anyway, since no matter 
the extent to which the men 
tried to control things, the 
precise times of ovulation of 
their women were unpredic- 



table. Those moments were de- 
terminable when they hap- 
pened, but were predictable 
only within limits. 

D eeper into the lunar night 
now, and one cassette or another 
is providing a measure of auditory 
privacy. The provision of those tapes 
had been good thinking by someone. 
Gary: Four days to midnight. 
Beverly: Or D-day. Yes. 

Gary: Nothing on the curve yet? 
Beverly: No. And I’ve quit having 
awful thoughts that it will just stay 
flat. I can tell, now. 

Gary: Of course it won’t stay flat. 
Nor will I, for that matter. If you’ll 
just move over a little... 

Beverly: Yes, Gary -person. Come 
And: 

Kathleen: Ron? 

Ronald: Kathy? 

Kathleen: We’re coming up to 
midnight. 

Ronald: We are. Three or four 
more days. 

Kathleen: Is it all right if I want 
you now? 

Ronald: The thermometer doesn’t 
show anything yet? 

Kathleen: No. But soon. I can tell, 
I think. Maybe tonight. Look at this. 

She withdraws something from be- 
neath her pillow, hands it to Ronald. 

Ronald: What in the— a baby 

shoe. Jesus Christ. In your PPP. That 
is so goddamn sentimental... 

Kathleen: I know. But I wanted to 
do it. It’s one of Carol’s. So. Now, all 
right? 



MAYFLOWER TWO

Shadowy movements, on the 
screen and the music continuing all 
night since everyone went to sleep 
while it was still on. 



T WO days later Kathleen Watson 
approached Beverly Brooks. “I 
need a word in private,” she said. 
They went to one side of the dome. 
“My ovulometer is busted.” 
“Busted?” 

“Ron snapped it in half last night. 
I’m sorry. I guess I’ll have to borrow 
yours in the mornings?” 

“What happened?” 

Kathleen turned to look at the 
night, dimly Earthlit. 

“Well, not to put too fine a point 
on it he wanted to make love again 
last night— we had the night before— 
and I thought we shouldn’t because 
of the count. He lost his temper and 
said he didn’t care to be programed 
all that much and he broke it.” 
Beverly sighed. 

“We don’t have to tell Houston, 
do we?” Kathleen asked. Such report 
would not reflect great credit into 
Ronald’s dossier. 

“I don’t see why we’d have to. I’ll 
have to tell Gary, of course. But I 
don’t know why he’d have to report 
it. As soon as I’ve used mine I’ll take 
it in to you. You stay quiet in bed 
until I get it to you. No problem.” 
Kathleen smiled. “All right. I’m 
sorry.” 

“No problem. Except one.” 
“What’s that?” 

“Ron best not break mine too. I 



hope he— and you— understand that.” 
“I’ll take good care of it,” Kath- 
leen said. 

M orning of the fourteenth 
day into the mission. Beverly 
removes the ovulometer and ex- 
amines it. 

“That’s it,” she says. “Countdown 
have come to zero.” 

“Well, in that case—” 

“No. Poor baby. Give it a little 
time to migrate. Augments the prob- 
ability of success.” 

“What migrate? The ovum?:; 
“Yes.” 

“You’re not worried about suc- 
cess.” 

“Well, no I’m not, if you want to 
know the truth.” 

She took the ovulometer in to 
Kathleen. 

“We’re there,” Kathleen said. 

“Ah. Tonight, then, perhaps the 
La Tache.'” 

“And Gary’s candlelight.” 

“Yes. Congratulations, love.” 
“Don’t mention it. You don’t sup- 
pose it could be a— monster or some- 
thing?” 

“The different radiation, the 
gravity?” 

“Yes.” 

“No way. Don’t worry love, it will 
be fine. Just fine.” 

Daily report; 

“Mission Control from Nec- 
taris Base,” Beverly said. 
“Roger, Beverly.”

usual rundown. Then: “Also, 
we have two ovulations here. 
As of this morning. So tell the 
boys in the biomed backroom 
that their timing was faultless.” 
“We copy that. Fine busi- 
ness.” 

“Roger. Nectaris Base out.” 
The daily contact with Earth 
was reassuring, but not as 
much so in the event as they 
had thought in anticipation. 

D uring the rest of the day they 
got on with the work of the 
mission, the other work of the 
mission, such busy work as they 
could find to do within the dome 
during the lunar night. In midafter- 
noon they were ready to play— it 
shouldn’t have to be said that they 
chose bridge instead of poker. They 
played a close rubber, which the 
Brookses won. 

Then there was candlelight and 
wine and dinner eventually over, 
everyone going along as usual, clean- 
ing up afterward and then, in quiet 
celebration, some Grand Marnier as 
they sat there and looked at each 
other and up at Earth. 

“That was a sharp play you made 
in the last hand, Gary.” Ronald said. 

“More luck than anything. I don’t 
think I really had it all taped.” 

“How about another rubber be- 
fore bed?” 

“Yes,” said Kathleen. “That 
would be nice.” 

Beverly and Gary exchanged brief 
but pregnant glances. Gary shrugged 



his shoulders an angstrom or two. No 
one noticed this but Beverly. She 
said, “Sure,” and Gary nodded and 
they set up the game. Which the 
Watsons won. 

“I feel a quotation from Pepys 
coming on,” Ronald said. 

“I can agree with that,” said 
Beverly. 

“I also.” Kathleen. 

“What quotation?” Gary asked, a 
query which brought him a variety of 
glances. “Well, I’m not a literary 
type,” he said. 

“And so to bed, dear,” Beverly 
said, and that sent Gary loping to his 
PPP from which he extracted a cas- 
sette which he thunked into the tape 
deck. Into the dome came then the 
roar and now the murmur of the 
Pacific Ocean smashing into rocks 
and rolling upon the sand of an 
isolated Oregon beach and compre- 
hension and delight rose in Beverly’s 
eyes. 

“That isn’t from—” 

“It is. Nice, hm?” 

“Very nice, Gary-person. And a 
surprise. I knew you were up to 
something that day. This is a beach 
we spent a few days at a while back,” 
she said to the Watsons. 

“It goes three hours without re- 
peating.” Gary said. “Listen to that. 
It was a stormy day.” 

And so, indeed, to bed.

displays, litmus-paper reactions.

polygraph squiggles and-all too 
often— in the look in the eyes of 
someone you’re looking at, not hav- 
ing to wait for what the conjoint 
vocal cords are going to put on you. 

Gone the wine and candlelight, 
but still Earth up there, beginning to 
wane, this datum determined by the 
relative positions of the three in- 
volved heavenly bodies. 

Forty-eight-hour pregnancy tests 
are now virtual certainties and 
Beverly has made the tests and Kath- 
leen has seen Beverly’s eyes. Beverly 
tells her anyway, with words. 

“The test could be wrong, right?” 
Kathleen asked. 

“Almost no chance. For a false 
positive, maybe, though the odds are 
thousands to one. But not for a false 
negative. I’m sorry, Kathy.” 

She reached to touch Kathleen’s 
arm. Gary and Ronald were on the 
other side of the dome playing two- 
handed showdown poker— a lousy 
game, but neither of them wanted to 
be with the two women, not at this 
moment, both of them knowing 
what was going on, one of them 
knowing what was transpiring. What 
was becoming known which had not 
been known before. 

“That’s all right. I don’t care that 
much. I don’t think I do. But I don’t 
think Ron will like it. Not for the 
right reasons, of course.” 

“Yes.” 

“Yours was positive. Is positive. I 
can tell.” 

Beverly hadn’t mentioned this. 
Now she nodded, thinking: I will not 



be irrepressibly smug about this. Nor 
will Gary. It could very well have 
been the other way round. 

And she wasn’t irrespressibly 
smug. Just a little. And so with Gary, 
when the communications had been 
dispersed throughout the population. 



Ill 

Daily report; 

“Mission Control from Nec- 
taris Base.” 

“Roger, Gary.” 

He ran through the run- 
down, then said, “We have one 
conception here. Beverly.” 
“Roger. Congratulations, 
you two. Hold one. Kathleen 
and Ron right there?” 

“Right here listening,” Gary 
said. 

New voice from the squawk 
box now. Sam Horowitz, chief 
of biomed. “Well, we batted 
five hundred and that’s not 
bad. Kathy and Ron?” 

“Yes.” 

“Yes.” 

“Not your fault. Not to fuss 
about it. We’re happy we got 
one. Could have been zero. 
Speaking for I ASA, we’re 
pleased. So— well, don’t be put 
down, that’s all. It will be day 
soon and you’ll all have lots of 
work to do. Then we’ll see you 
down here.” 

“We’U be aU right,” Kath- 
leen said.

“That’s right.” Ronald said. 
“Don’t you get uptight, Sam.” 
“Certainly not. Well, that’s 
all. See you later.” 

“Roger, Sam,” Gary said. 
“Anything else. Mission Con- 
trol?” 

“Negative. Mission Control 
out.” 

“Nectaris Base out.” 

F our days now until the arrival of 
the terminator, four more days of 
lunar night and the atmosphere with- 
in the dome reflected, of necessity, 
the results of the prime experiment. 
Beverly carried on as always, proud 
and happy to be pregnant again— and 
not just for lASA, but for herself and 
her Gary. Gary was unusually kind 
and gentle, particularly to Ronald, 
even while playing poker, though he 
didn’t give any hands away. Kathleen 
was discouraged and looked forward 
to getting back to her radio work— 
where she would be in control. 
Ronald Watson was the major prob- 
lem. And, as his wife had said, for 
the wrong reasons. 

G UNGA din kept coming into 
Ronald’s mind. He found this 
annoying and thrust it aside, but it 
kept coming back and he wondered 
why that was. He was not an ob- 
sessive-ruminative type, but was 
learning something of what it was 
like to be one. Awake too early the 
morning of lunar dawn, the ter- 
minator about three hours away, the 



rest of the phrase came uninvited 
into his mind. 

You ’re a better man than I am... 
But that’s not so, it doesn’t 
follow. Besides, I’m ahead in poker. 
And he knew that didn’t mean any- 
thing, not along the parameter of 
chief importance, but he carried all 
of it into the lunar dawn. 

N ight one moment, then the 
terminator flashing by, and it is 
day again, long-shadowed morning. 
They all wanted to get to their work 
outside and breakfast was a hurried 
affair. Suiting up and out the air 
lock. Gary drove the rover and 
dropped Beverly and Kathleen off at 
their places. 

“I’ll go with you, Gary, then walk 
off to the east. There’s a lot of 
ground to be covered there yet.” 
“You want the rover?” 

“I can do it better on foot. I’ll 
make a reasonable traverse eastward 
and circle toward the dome.” 

“I can follow your tracks and pick 
you up.” 

“I’d rather walk, old buddy. All 
right?” 

“Sure.” 

Gary stopped the vehicle by his 
instruments and Ronald loped off 
with his collecting bag. 

“Watch the dials, Ron.” Mission 
Control. The crew of Mayflower Two 
had a private circuit they could use 
in the field when they wanted to, but 
mostly they kept Houston cut in. 

“Acknowledge,” said Ron, stoop- 
ing over to study a rock. Gary 



MAYFLOWER TWO

watched him disappear into a small 
depression. 

T oward local five in the after- 
noon, then, with Beverly, Kath- 
leen and Gary back in the dome and 
Ronald out on the surface some- 
place. 

Gary decides he has waited long 
enough and fires up the rig. 

“Stork Three from Nectaris Base.” 
“Yes, Gary.” 

“It’s about time you got back. 
Location?” 

“I can see the dome. No sweat.” 
Houston suddenly came to life. 
“Stork Three from Mission Control.” 
“Roger.” 

“We read your oh two at point six. 
What is your capability?” 

“No sweat, I said. Now, if you 
don’t mind. I’m carrying a load of 
goodies and best not to talk. I’m 
heading for the dome. All circuits 
off.” 

There was a click and that was 
that. 

“Nectaris Base?” 

“Roger.” 

“Stand by to take auxiliary oxy- 
gen out to Ron. If he doesn’t show 
up soon he’ll need it.” 

“Roger. We’ll handle it. Nectaris 
Base out.” 

It was unnerving to Houston to be 
cut out, but it happened now and 
then. Gary and the girls looked out 
toward where Ronald should be. No 
sign. 

“Damn,” said Kathleen. 

Gary began to get his suit ready. 



“Not yet,” she said. “Not yet, Gary.” 

Two minutes later they saw his 
long shadow. Gary estimated the 
distance and did some fast calcu- 
lating. “It’s going to be close,” he 
said. 

“He’ll make it. Just. You’ll see.” 

And he did. Just. He stumbled 
through the airlock, got his helmet 
off by himself and sat down, panting. 
Gary checked the important dial. 
Zero. Kathleen was curiously silent, 
helped Ronald unsuit. Gary started 
to say something, but restrained him- 
self. 

“Houston first,” he muttered. 
“Mission Control from Nectaris 
Base.” 

“May I say, Gary—” 

“I know, Joe, I know. May I say 
that Stork Three is back in the dome. 
No problem. He was slightly delayed 
by a rich field of rocks. Nectaris Base 
out.” 

“Just a cotton-picking minute, 
Gary. You cut us out again at a time 
like that and there might be a bit of 
trouble when you get back, hear? 
How much oxygen left when he got 
back?” 

“Enough,” Gary said. 

“Our telemetry showed mighty 
close to zero before Ron thought to 
cut it off.” 

“It was low, but he made it. Now, 
we really do have work to do. Nec- 
taris Base out.” 

Mission Control clicked off with- 
out acknowledgement. 

Gary turned to Ronald. “Not 
again, hear?”

GALAXY 




“No thanks, Gary.” 

“Us astros mus’ stick together,” 
Beverly said. “But you had us scared 
there, Ronnie-boy. Naughty.” 

They had one bottle of wine left, 
but they were saving it for the last 
day. 

AND that last day came, the last 
full day. The work of the morn- 
ing, the final work of the mission, 
was finished. Rocks, records, most of 
the personal belongings had been 
neatly stashed in Stork. They would 
complete their bridge and poker 
tournaments in the afternoon— but 
first, something else. 

It had become traditional for each 
astronaut to leave something on the 
moon, something of himself, his 
life— a need or compulsion no one, 
including the astronauts, entirely 
understood. Some of these items had 
been well-publicized— some were 
known only to the astronaut and to 
those, if any, in whom he chose to 
confide. In at least two early in- 
stances this practice had been sub- 
jected to commercial exploitation, to 
(then) NASA’s dismay. Most of these 
objects to be left behind had, how- 
ever, been chosen for deeply personal 
reasons— and thus constituted a kind 
of personality test, a lunar Rorschach 
of sorts. Now it was Mayflower 
Two’s turn. 

“Beverly and I are going for a 
walk,” Gary said after lunch. 

“We will, too, shortly,” Kathleen 
said. 



“I’ll be taking the rover.” Ronald. 

“Where you going?” 

“To The Mountain.” 

It wasn’t a mountain, just a collec- 
tion of rough boulders, curiously 
piled. Ronald had spent a bit of time 
there, chipping away at those large 
masses. 

“What are you going to put out 
there?” Gary asked. 

“I may tell you later. What are 
you going to leave?” 

“I’ll show you.” 

Gary went to his quarters and 
returned with something in his hand. 
He held it out. 

“An onyx cube,” he said, “Three 
inches on each side.” 

They passed it around. 

“It’s very handsome,” Kathleen 
said. “Why that?” 

“You know, that’s hard to say. 1 
don’t know. All this dust, soil, these 
rocks. I like the idea of a polished 
onyx cube sitting on top of a round 
boulder I know.” 

He began to suit up, as did 
Beverly. 

There was a shyness about asking. 

“I’ll show you what I’m leaving,” 
Beverly said— and did. It was a toy, a 
rocket model. 

“Why that?” 

“George thought it would be a 
good idea.” George was their 
younger son. 

Kathleen had planned on leaving 
the baby shoe, but had abandoned 
that and hadn’t brought along a 
backup. 

Beverly and Gary went out 



MAYFLOWER TWO 



77 




through the lock and the other two 
followed shortly. Ronald went off in 
the rover. Beverly just walked about. 

T he two women and Gary were 
back in the dome within thirty 
minutes and began setting up the 
table for bridge. 

“Ron?” Kathleen asked on local 
circuit. 

“Just got here,” he said. “Set up 
the bridge table.” 

“It is.” 

“Fine. Just as soon as I get to the 
top of this pile of rocks I’ll be on my 
way back.” 

“Ron,” Kathleen said, an edge to 
her voice. 

“Yes?” 

“You don’t have to go to the 
top.” 

“Oh, yes— I do. I’m going to put 
something up there. I’ll be right 
down.” 

“Ron. I’ve been out there. That’s 
dangerous. You’re not to do it.” 
Gary made as if to take the mike 
from Kathleen. “No,” she said, 
switch off, “I know what he’s trying 
to do.” Switch on. “Ron, for God’s 
sake, it’s our last day. Come on back 
and let’s play bridge and have a nice 
dinner. With the Chambertin.” 

“Will do. This won’t take long.” 
Houston was in on none of this. 
Kathleen shrugged and put down 
the mike. “No way to stop him. He’s 
proving something again, goddamn it. 
Three-handed bridge, anyone?” 

They fiddled around inside the 
dome, waiting. Gary sat at the table. 



consulted the cumulated scores. 

“I’m going to be down about 
twenty-five dollars,” he said. “Ron’s 
up about forty. Kathy’s down about 
ten. Which leaves Bev down five. 
Bridge and poker together.” 

Kathleen picked up her watch and 
reached for the mike. 

“Ron?” she said. “Ron?” 

“Yes, Kathy,” His breathing was 
labored. 

“Are you all right? You on your 
way down?” 

“I’m on my way down,” he said, 
breathing heavily. “I got to the top.” 
Pause. “And I’m on my way down.” 
The three of them at the squawk 
box, listening to the breathing. 
“And— I’m stuck.” 

Gary took the mike from Kath- 
leen. 

“Ron. Quit trying to get unstuck, 
then. Save your oxygen. That’s an 
order. Very briefly, what’s your situ- 
ation?” 

“I fell. Left boot wedged in be- 
tween couple of damn rocks.” Kath- 
leen started to put on her suit. “I’m 
more or less upside down.” Heavy 
breathing. “No sweat. Just can’t get 
this misbegotten boot—” 

“Okay, Ron. Cool it. Relax. Save 
your breath. We’re on the way.” 

Kathleen was about ready to go 
through the lock. 

“Hold it, Kathy. I’m coming, 
too.” 

“No, Gary. Can’t you see-I have 
to do it?” 

“That’s about an hour and a half 
to walk out there.” 



78 



GALAXY 




“There’s plenty of oxygen. Besides 
we won’t have to walk back, there’s 
the rover.” 

“You might not be strong enough 
to dislodge that boot.” 

“I can do it. I have to.” 

And she was gone. They watched 
her until she disappeared over the 
rise. Gary made no move to follow. 
“You’re right,” Beverly said. 
“What?” 

“Not to go with her. She has to do 
it.” 

“I don’t see it. I’m not sure. 
Maybe I should follow.” 

“You’re not a woman, Gary. A 
fact for which I am profoundly glad. 
But you are sometimes dense.” 
“Come on. I knew Ron was put 
down when Kathy didn’t conceive. 
But this is ridiculous.” 

“He wasn’t just put down, Gary— 
he was wounded. As he’s apparently 
trying to demonstrate for the second 
time. For him to be rescued by you, 
now, would be just too much. It’ll be 
bad enough as it is.” 

Little conversation for the next 
hour and a quarter. 

Then: “I’m almost there,” Kath- 
leen said. “About ten more 
minutes.” 

Ron was very quiet, saying only 
from time to time that he was all 
right. The blood was down to his 
head and uncomfortable, but in the 
lunar gravity this was no disaster. 

“I’m here,” she said. “And you are 
indeed just about upside down.” 
Ronald was about halfway down 
the awkward pile of rock, his fish- 



bowl no more than three feet above 
the lunar surface. 

“This ought to be easy.” Kathleen 
kneeled in front of him. “Just put 
your hands on my shoulders for 
leverage and push up.” 

“Give me a lever and I can move 
the world.” Ronald misquoted. 

He pushed himself upward gently 
and freed the boot within ten 
seconds. He fell down the last three 
feet, he and Kathleen mingling to- 
gether in a slowly writhing display of 
arms and legs, finally coming easily 
to rest in languid swirls of moondust, 
their helmets together. 

And Ronald began to laugh. Kath- 
leen thought for a moment he was 
hysterical but he was really laughing 
and it was contagious— in a moment 
they were helpless on the ground, 
convulsed, faces wet with tears. 

Meanwhile, back in the dome Gary 
reached for tlie microphone, but 
Beverly held his hand. The laughter 
eventually subsided. 

“Now,” Ronald said, “if I may 
take you for a short ride in this, my 
latest convertible—” 

“A pleasure,” Kathleen said. 

“They’re both crazy,” Gary said. 

“No, they’re not,” said his wife. 

“Oh,” Ronald said. “Mission ac- 
complished. Shuffle the cards.” 

“They’re waiting,” said Gary. 

T he Watsons entered the 
dome in high spirits and Ronald 
unsuited. Kathleen removed her fish- 
bowl. 

“Sorry, Chief,” Ronald said, “but 



MAYFLOWER TWO 



79 




I had to put my thing where I 
wanted to put it.” 

“Okay. So what is so bloody 
funny then?” 

“Well, I hadn’t planned to tell 
anyone what I put up there. But I 
might as well. It was something I 
won in high school. It meant a lot to 
me. A medal. I won it in track.” 

“Discus throw?” 

“No. Javelin. It was the contrast, 
you see. And our slapstick tumble—” 
He began to laugh again, then Kath- 
leen, then all of them, and thus a 
final catharsis. 

Kathleen clumped into the Watson 
quarters, came out with something, 
said she’d be right back and put her 
helmet back on. Out the lock she 
went and was back in ten minutes. 

T WO stubs of yellow candles on 
the table, throwing no light, and 
the Chamber tin finished. Their last 
lunar night, approaching midday, the 
sun high and the shadows short. Not 
much interest in bridge or poker, 
they’d played enough games. 

Final daily report; 

“Mission Control from 
Stork.’’' 

“Been waiting for you, 
Gary. Didn’t want to interrupt 
your party.” 

“We copy that and we thank 
you for your solicitude. Every- 
thing under control at end of 
final lunar day. We’ll be ready 
for liftoff right on the button 
tomorrow.” 



“No problems?” 

“No problems. We’re about 
ready to sack out for the last 
time in this here mylarplex 
mansion. See you tomorrow. 
Stork out.” 

“See you tomorrow, you all. 
Talk to you, leastways. Hous- 
ton out.” 

A casette into the deck and the 
couples into their quarters. 

“Our last night,” Kathleen said. 
“Yes. What did you take out 
there, just after we got back?” 

“You won’t laugh?” 

“I’ve laughed enough today, I 
think. What was it?” 

“Carol’s shoe. It seemed all right 
after we fell together at The Moun- 
tain.” 

“Yes. Good night, Kathy.” 

“Good night.” 

“You think the baby will be— all 
right?” 

“Of course, Bev. Better be, or 
we’ll never make it to the stars.” 
“That’s really what this is all 
about, isn’t it? To get us out there?” 
“It is. One more step that-a-way. 
We’ve done our share.” 

“Yes. Good night, Gary-person.” 
“Good night.” 

They all eventually drifted off into 
sleep, in their ears the sound of the 
Pacific Ocean crashing onto an iso- 
lated Oregon shore. It went on all 
night, until they turned it off in the 
morning. *

BOOKSHELF 







I T IS seldom that 1 devote this 
space entirely to a single shipment 
from a single publisher, but I think 
you will agree that this time it’s 
worth it. The only departure stems 
from my promise to review the new 
Heinlein— which, as you well know, is 
worth seven times the space I have, 
all by itself. 

The shipment; a box from the 
Seabury Press in New York. Con- 
tents: four books— an anthology and 
three novels. The antho’s editor is 
Germany’s Franz Rottensteiner, a 
name frequently -appearing in the fan 
press, wherein his easy command of 
English always impressed me. Under 
the title View from Another Shore 
(Seabury, $6.95) he gives us a gener- 
ous sample of European science fic- 
tion, an essay on the nature of same, 
and a useful bio/bibliography of the 
contributors. The stories come from 
Poland, France, Denmark, West Ger- 
many, Czechoslavakia, Rumania, 
Italy and the Soviet Union. 

Now, I’d like to review the stories 



strictly on their own merits, but 
Rottensteiner won’t let me, for 
around them he has woven a fabric 
of opinion, the texture of which is 
that unbeknownst to English-speak- 
ing readers, there is “uniquely Euro- 
pean” science fiction. “International 
science fiction,” he writes, “is an 
illusion; the only truly international 
science fiction is bad science fiction 
whose cliches are the same no matter' 
where they are written.” He goes on, 
“It is perhaps a matter of philoso- 
phy, of seriousness of purpose, as 
opposed to the irrelevance and play- 
fulness of most American sf. These 
men—” He’s talking about Stanis^aw 
Lem, the Strugatski brothers, and 
Herbert W. Franke— “deal with real 
problems, and they come to grips 
with the problems posed.” 

I wish he hadn’t said that, because 
such provincialism calls stridently for 
a counter-provincialism, into which I 
am not about to get trapped— not 1, 
whose early gods and initiators were 
Verne, Wells, and Karel Capek. Even 



81 




though I have conceded (many 
times) that science fiction is ninety 
percent crap, I have said as often that 
the best of sf is as good as the best of 
anything anywhere. And in saying 
that, I mean not only in craftsman- 
ship and narrative architecture, but 
in substance: in deahng with real 
problems responsibly, with clarity 
and force. Cream is cream, on either 
side of the sea, and good writers have 
more in common than they have 
differences. To brand the bulk of 
American sf as trivial is as foolish as 
the term “uniquely European.” The 
best of the fiction in this box of 
books is very good indeed, and some 
of the works might be called unique, 
even. But “uniquely European?” 
Let’s look first at the anthology. 
Aside from the nit I have just picked, 
Rottensteiner’s introduction is in- 
formative and interesting. I have not 
seen such a discussion of European sf 
since Sam LundwaU’s in Science Fic- 
tion- What It’s All About and Rot- 
tensteiner covers even more ground. 
Did you know that the most widely 
read sf author in the world is Po- 
land’s Lem? And that the only sf 
section of a national writer’s associa- 
tion in the world is Hungary’s? The 
list of prominent sf writers he gives is 
a long one, as is the list of countries 
and languages in which sf is now 
being produced. It makes one hope 
that the Heidelberg convention will 
be followed by an increasing number 
of cons on the continent— judging by 
the knowledgeable Lundwall and 
Rottensteiner, there’s hardly a place 



where such an event would not be 
welcome— and yeah hooray. The 
world’s problems will never be solved 
unless and until we acknowledge that 
we’re aU of the same species and I 
can hardly tliink of a better, faster, 
more penetrating way to do this than 
to infuse each other’s speculative 
literature. 

AS FOR the stories, Rottensteiner 
t\. makes no claim to their being 
“bests.” Modestly, and probably ac- 
curately, he makes tire point that he 
is showcasing what he has been able 
to find that is both available and 
pleasant to his palate -and I must say 
he has a pretty good one. Briefly; 

From Poland the towering Lem 
gives us a comic and erudite tale of 
two robots, friends and rivals, and 
the obsession one of them has to 
discover the nature of happiness. To 
research this, he creates microcosms 
and microscopic beings whose size 
and rapid time-scale makes cultural 
evolution conveniently subject to 
study. For all the “uniqueness” of 
this concept, which I first encoun- 
tered in 1939,' I found it enjoyable, 
often hilarious. Lem is most inven- 
tive and resourceful and he must 
have given his translator real hell. 

The two French entries are disap- 
pointing. Gerard Klein gives us a slice 
of early Bradbury, and J.P. Andrevon 
something that might have been 
lifted from William Tenn’s The Men 
in the Walls— W (as has never happen- 

' Might that have been Microcosmic God 
by Theodore Sturgeon? -Ed.

ed) William Tenn had decided to try 
a little sex-sationalism . This account 
of an alien’s study of a captive 
human couple was completely 
spoiled for me by a reference to 
Arabic numerals and the symbol for 
infinity, by a creature which knew so 
little of humankind that even mam- 
malian reproduction was unknown to 
it. 

Denmark’s Svend Age Madsen, 
Herbert W. Franke of West Germany, 
and Josef Nesvadba, a Czech— each in 
his own way probes philosophical 
and ethical problems. The Dane uses 
a fairy-tale structure to investigate 
the nature of reality (and, are we 
performers on someone’s stage?). 
The others deal, at base, with Can- 
dide’s edict; we should cultivate our 
own gardens . with the corollary: 
how? And— where are the fences, 
really? I liked these. 

The Rumanian story is not to be 
believed and whether it’s worth the 
effort is up to you. Lino Aldani, 
from Italy, tells us colorfully about 
the social consequences of “Oneiro- 
films”— a technically extended ver- 
sion of Aldous Huxley’s “feelies”. 
Here again the basic momentum is 
toward the nature of reality, and I 
can’t fault that. But haven’t you read 
it elsewhere? 

And now we come to the three 
Soviet writers, and Sever Gansovski’s 
truly superb story The Proving 
Ground. I haven’t been so excited by 
a writer since I found an Edgar 
Pangborn in Galaxy’s slushpile. 
Here’s a man who thinks clean. 



writes clean, lifts you up and sets 
you down quivering. The hardest of 
hard-core sf addicts will be delighted 
with this story, but so will those who 
read for structure and those who 
look for meaning. Gansovski— a name 
to look for. Then comes Vsevolod 
Ivanov, with a slice of pure myth; a 
soldier returning from Alexander the 
Great’s army encounters Sisyphus, 
the giant who was condemned by 
Zeus to roll a huge stone forever up a 
tall hill. What happens when the 
soldier informs Sisyphus that Zeus 
has released him? A fine fable— and if 
the above-mentioned hard-core sf ad- 
dict rejects it, it’s his loss. Finally, 
Vadim Shefner writes a warm little 
story about an overly modest super- 
genius and the girl he loves— a warm 
little tale that cuts sharply at human 
failings on its backswing. 

No, Herr Rottensteiner— you have 
not made your point that there is a 
uniquely European sf. Rest on your 
other laurels: that you have un- 
covered for us an unsuspected popu- 
lation of peers, the best of whom are 
every bit as good as the best of ours. 
For that we can be genuinely grate- 
ful. 

ALSO in this treasure-trove from 
Seabury Press are three novels— 
and the least shall be first : 

Though it has much fascination 
for tlie nuts-and-bolts clique. The 
Temple of the Past by French 
author Stefan Wul (Seabury, $6.95) 
whiplashes through so many changes 
at the end that it defeats itself—

especially the biggest revelation of 
all, one of those sudden exposures of 
utter banality. Still you might like 
the notion of a crashed spaceship 
having been gobbled up as was 
Jonah, and the long howdunit about 
escaping from the escape-proof. 

Memoirs Found in a Bathtub (Sea- 
bury, $6.95) is by Rottensteiner’s 
idol, StanisVaw Lem, and from this 
one can understand the idolatry. 
Inescapably one thinks of Kafka, as 
the protagonist wanders through a 
super-secret Pentagon reverently 
called The Building. It has no con- 
nection with the outside (with re- 
ality, perhaps?) and inside, spying 
and betrayal are a way of life. We 
follow the tortuous passage of the 
protagonist through the endless halls 
and offices, meeting all sorts of 
characters on the way. The hero has 
been selected for a secret mission, 
but no one will tell him what it is. He 
has no clear idea who his boss is, or 
over whom he has authority. A well- 
wrought nightmare indeed. 

Lem again: The Invincible (Sea- 
bury, $6.95) is very different indeed 
from both his above-cited examples. 
Here is sf in the grand tradition, the 
starship with a mission, the mysteiy 
of the fate of a sistership, the ex- 
ploration of a strange and menacing 
planet, the discovery of an un-alive 
“life-form.” The science is hard. The 
descriptions are vivid and powerful. 
And but for some excess heroics on 
the part of the protagonist, I find no 
nits to pick. The publisher reports 
that his 28 titles have sold six million 



copies in thirty languages and one 
begins to understand why. Especially 
provocative is a soliloquy on the 
attitude that there can be no alterna- 
tive to conquest. 

AND finally— the Soviet brothers 
Arkadi and Boris Strugatski. See 
above what I said about the “dis- 
covery” of Gansovski. It’s like that: 
wherever and whenever you see the 
name A&B Strugatski, grab it. Hard 
to Be a God (Seabury, $6.95) is one 
of the most skillfully written, heavily 
freighted sf novels I have ever read. 
What do you Uke-why do you read 
sf at aU? Super-gadgets? Historical 
parallels? Alien worlds? Swords, sor- 
cery, heroism? Well, they’re all here 
in full measure. The writing is well 
paced and the narrative is beautifully 
structured. The basic situation is, I 
think, Marxian, and the historical 
imperative. (Parenthetically, neither 
here nor in any of the above-men- 
tioned Eastern bloc writings was I 
aware of any Communist preach- 
ment— which, I confess, surprised 
me.) Given that a feudal culture will 
evolve into a democracy and that this 
may produce state capitalism, as in 
the Nazi-Fascist regime; suppose that 
the Hitler Youth or Red Guard phe- 
nomenon occurs early— too early, 
while feudalism still dominates. 
Now: you are on a secret mission 
from a highly advanced Earth. You 
may help, but you must not inter- 
fere. You see this “gray shirt” phe- 
nomenon developing at the wrong 
point in the planet’s history— what

do you do? Get the book and find 
out. 

Summing up, then: speculative fic- 
tion is by no means a phenomenon 
of the English-speaking world— if 
indeed it ever was— and the top levels 
of the creamiest cream may be found 
anywhere. I am grateful for this box 
of books, and just by the way— I 
salute those translators, who have 
done some extraordinary jobs in this 
treasure-trove. 



AND now a new Heinlein: Time 
Enough for Love -The Lives of 
Lazarus Long (G.P.Putnam’s Sons, 
$7.95). At 605 pages it’s a big pack- 
age at a very small price. I’m a httle 
late in reporting it to you because 
this was one book 1 determined to 
read slowly and thoughtfully— and 
when 1 had done so I took more time 
for rumination. I have not at this 
writing seen any other reviews of it, 
but 1 can predict a lot of jackal- 
yapping at the old lion. It will be said 
that the book is self-indulgent, that it 
is a catch-all, that RAH is cashing in 
on his heap of notes and notions, and 
above all, that 'the author’^ “fascism” 
is showing. 

I’d like to address myself to that 
last item first, because I’m so heartily 
sick of hearing it. Fascism itself is 
one of the forms of state capitaUsm 
and is by its nature anathema to an 
old empire-builder like Heinlein/ 
Jubal/Lazarus. He has a spectrum of 
scorn for masses of people who 
follow, simply follow without de- 



cision or dedication, and though it 
may be gentle when the following is 
something he personally believes in, 
it is still scorn, and rises to detesta- 
tion when the sheep follow an idiot 
or a madman. It’s so easy to stick out 
a tongue and smack a simplistic wet 
label on one’s betters, but just maybe 
they have grounds for their convic- 
tions, and just maybe one should 
crawl behind their eyeballs and see 
things their way for just long enough 
to understand how they came to 
their conclusions. I’ll give you just 
one example of how Heinlein can 
spin one’s head around if one will 
but yield him the floor for a bit. This 
was a private conversation, not from 
his works. I had said something 
about traffic laws, by and large, 
being the most pragmatic, the most 
just, and the most universally 
obeyed, and perhaps other bodies of 
law should be patterned on them. 
Heinlein agreed but said about 
drunks in cars that “for them we 
should bring back the whipping 
post.” My reaction was horrified and 
forceful and I said things about 
barbarism, sadism, recidivism and 
outright cruelty. Heinlein heard me 
out and then said quietly, “Now 
look. My neighbor on the right has a 
three-car garage under a mansion in 
the middle of two hundred forty 
acres. The neighbor on the left is a 
divorcee with four kids in a rental. 
The bite for drunken driving, first 
offense” (he was living in Colorado 
at the time) “is $250. If my neighbor 
on the right should get convicted in 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



85 




court, it would mean the expendi- 
ture of whatever effort it took to 
find his checkbook and inscribe some 
numbers. For me it might mean the 
cancellation of a side-trip on my next 
world cruise. For the neighbor on the 
left, the mother, it would be a 
cataclysm. Now just suppose convic- 
tion meant ten lashes across the 
back. It would hurt us all just as 
much, just the same way.” While my 
head was spinning off in search for a 
good answer, he amended, before I 
could even think of it, “Of course, 
there would be a full medical exam 
beforehand and the blows would be 
administered by a machine.” 

It is this ability to think things 
through which, when added to his 
skill and his joy in spinning a yarn, 
that makes Heinlein the giant he is. It 
does something else, too, and I am 
amazed that so few of his admirers, 
critics, students and enemies have 
not caught the point. He emerges 
from straight (and strait) origins, 
through the armed forces and pro- 
fessional engineering, and has every 
conditioned reason to be a square; 
but this drive to ask the next ques- 
tion, and the one after that, has 
produced a man who champions Eros 
even when it involves siblings or 
parents or consexuals. Paradox? Not 
at all. Robert and Jubal and Lazarus 
are never satisfied with thinking a 
thing through to a conclusion and 
stopping there, and the point so 
many seem to have missed is that this 
urgency in the man, and its ex- 
pression, have been responsible for 



many departures from his deep con- 
ditioning, and have required a great 
deal of courage. It hurts to think 
things all the way through. It hurts. 

Now lest I be justly accused of 
reviewing the man instead of his 
work, I must be unjustly brief. Time 
Enough for Love is about Lazarus 
Long, who appeared in several stories 
in the ’forties, and whose life is a 
solid unbroken line on the chart of 
Heinlein’s celebrated “future his- 
tory.” Born at the end of the 19th 
century, Lazarus is looking at his 
third thousand years of life. The 
book is not a solid unbroken line; it 
is a rambling, out-of-order collection 
of yarns about and by Lazarus— and 
so states itself to be right at the 
beginning. Carp as you will at the 
reiteration of the Heinlein idiom: 
crusty authoritarian infallible man 
meets strong courageous willing 
woman in harsh political/physical/ 
economic environment— they decide 
to have their way and damn well 
have it. In the meantime the house- 
keeping, be it budget or business, 
staples or stocks, is immaculate. But 
along with it is the fascination of 
watching the mind of a man whose 
reach always exceeds his grasp but 
who will never stop reaching. Above 
and around it aU is his concept of 
Eros, a great mosaic which includes 
but transcends the patterns of sex. 

Time Enough for Love will not 
create the following that occurred 
with Stranger in a Strange Land. 
Personally, I like it less than Stran- 
ger-hut I love it more. ★

SOME JOYS 
UNDER THE 
STAR 



The comet brought joy to 
all who could endure it! 



FREDERIKPOHL 




I N FEW recognizable ways were 
Albert Novak— the man who 
stalked Myron Landau— and the Sec- 
retary of State alike, but tliey had 
this in common: they wanted. They 
each wanted something very badly 
and, as it happens, the thing that 
each wanted was not good by the 
general consensual standards of your 
average sensual man. 

Let us start with the man who 
stalked Myron Landau or, more ac- 
curately, with Myron Landau him- 
self. Myron also wanted, and what he 
wanted was his girlfriend Ellen, with 
that masked desperation that char- 
acterizes the young man of seventeen 
who has never yet made out. 

On this night of July in New York 
City the factors against Myron were 
inexperience, self-doubt and the ob- 
stinacy of Ellen herself, but ranged 
on his side were powerful allies. 
Before him was the great welcoming 
blackness of Central Park, where 
anything might happen, and spread 
across the sky was a fine pretext for 
luring her into the place. So he 
bought her a strawberry milkshake in 



87 





Rumpelmeyer’s and strolled with her 
into the park, chatting of astronomy, 
beauty and love. 

“Are you sure it’s all right?” asked 
Ellen, looking into the sodium-lit 
fringes of the undergrowth. 

“Gripes, yes,” said Myron, in the 
richly amused tone of a Brown Belt 
in karate from one of the finest 
academies on the upper West Side, 
although in fact he had never gone 
into Central Park at night before. But 
he had thought everytliing out care- 
fully and was convinced that tonight 
there was no danger. Or at any rate 
not enough danger to scare him off 
the prize. Overhead was the great 
beautiful comet that everybody was 
talking about and it was a clear night. 
Tliere would be lots of people look- 
ing at the sky, he reasoned, and in 
any case where else could he take 
her? Not his apartment, with 
Grandma’s ear to the living-room 
door, just itching for an excuse to 
come in and start hunting for her 
glasses. Not Ellen’s place, not with 
her mother and sister remorselessly 
there. “You can’t see the comet well 
from the middle of the street,” he 
said reasonably, putting his arm 
around her and nodding to a hand- 
some white-haired gentleman who 
had first nodded benevolently to 
them. “There’s too much light and 
anyway, honestly, Ellen, we won’t go 
in very far.” 

“1 never saw a comet before,” she 
conceded, allowing herself to be led 
down tlie path. In truth, the comet 
Ujifusa-McGinnis was not all that 



hard to see. It spread its tail over a 
quarter of the sky, drowning out 
Altair, Vega and the stars around 
Deneb, hardly paled even by the 
lights of New York City. Even a 
thousand miles south, where NASA 
technicians were working around- 
the-clock shifts under the floodliglits 
of the Vehicle Assembly Building, 
trying to get ready the launch of the 
probe that would plumb Ujifusa-Mc- 
Ginnis’s mysteries, it dominated the 
sky. 

Myron looked upward and allowed 
himself to be distracted for a mo- 
ment by the spectacle, but quickly 
caught himself. “Ah,” he said, creep- 
ing his fingers toward the lower slope 
of Ellen’s breast, “just think, what 
you see is all gas. Nothing really 
there at all. And millions of miles 
away.” 

“It’s beautiful,” Ellen said, look- 
ing over her shoulder. She had 
thought she had heard a noise. 

She had. The noise was in fact 
real. The foot of the handsome 
white-haired gentleman had broken a 
stick. He had turned off the flagstone 
path into the shelter of the dwarf 
evergreens and was now busy puUing 
a woman’s nylon stocking over his 
white hair and face. He, too, had 
planned his evening carefully. In his 
right-hand coat pocket he had the 
woolen sock with half a pound of 
BBs knotted into the toe— that was 
for Myron. In his left-hand pocket he 
had the clasp knife with the carefully 
honed edge. That was for Ellen, first 
to make sure she didn’t scream, then 



88 



GALAXY 




to make sure she never would. He 
had not known their names when he 
loaded his pockets and left his ranch 
house in Waterbury, Connecticut, to 
go in for an evening’s sport to the 
city, but he had known there would 
be somebody. 

He, too, looked up at the comet, 
but with irritation. In his Connecti- 
cut back yard, as he had shown it to 
his daughter, it had looked 
pretty. Here it was an unqualified 
nuisance. It made the night brighter 
tlian he wanted it although, he 
thought in all fairness, it was not as 
bad as a full moon. 

It would not be more than five 
minutes, he calculated, before the 
boy would lead the girl in among the 
evergreens. But which way? If only 
they would choose his side of the 
path! Otherwise it meant he had to 
cross the walk. That was a small 
danger and a large annoyance, be- 
cause it meant scuttling in an undig- 
nified way. Still, the fun was worth 
the trouble. It always had been 
worth it. 

With the weighted sock now ready 
in his hand, the handsome white- 
haired gentleman followed them 
silently. He could feel the gleeful 
premonitory stirrings of sexual ex- 
citement in his private parts. He was 
as happy as, in his life, he ever was. 



AT A time approximately two 
IM. thousand years earlier, when 
Jesus was a boy in Nazareth and 
Caesar Augustus was counting up his 



statues and his gold, a race of crea- 
tures resembling soft-slielled crabs on 
a planet of a star some two hundred 
light-years away became belatedly 
aware of the existence of the Great 
Wall of China. 

Although it alone among the then 
existing works of Man was quite 
detectable in their telescopes, it was 
not surprising they had not noticed it 
before. It had been completed less 
than 250 years before and most of 
that time had been lost in the creep- 
ing traverse of light from Earth to 
their planet. Also they had many, 
many planets to observe and not a 
great deal of time to waste on any 
one. But they expected more of their 
minions than that, and 10,000 mem- 
bers of a subject race died in great 
pain as a warning to the others to be 
more diligent. 

The Arrogating Ones, as they 
called themselves and were called by 
their subjects, at once took up in 
their collective councils the question 
of whether or not to conquer Earth 
and add humanity to their vassals, 
now that they had discovered that 
humanity did exist. This was their 
eon-long custom. It had made them 
extremely unpopular over a large 
volume of the galaxy. 

On balance, they decided not to 
bother at that particular time. What 
were a few heaped-up rocks, after 
all? Oh, some sort of civilization no 
doubt existed, but the planet Earth 
seemed too distant, too trivial and 
too poor to be worth bothering to 
conquer. 



SOME JOYS UNDER THE STAR 



89 




Accordingly they contented them- 
selves with routine precautionary 
measures. Item, they caused to be 
abducted in their disk-shaped vessels 
certain specimens of Earthly human 
beings and other fauna. These also 
died in great pain and in the process 
released much information about 
tlieir body chemistry, physical struc- 
ture and modes of thought. Item, the 
Arrogating Ones dispatched certain 
of their servants with a waiting brief. 
They were instructed to occupy the 
core of a comet and from it to keep 
an eye on those endoskeletal, but 
potentially annoying, creatures who 
had discovered agriculture, fire, the 
city and the wheel, but not as yet 
even chemical explosive weapons. 

They then dismissed Earth from 
their collective soft-bodied minds, 
and returned to the more interesting 
contemplation of measures to be 
taken against a race of insect-like 
beings that lived in a steamy high-G 
planet in quite the other direction 
from Earth, toward the core of the 
galaxy. The insects had elected not 
to be conquered by the Arrogating 
Ones. In fact, they had destroyed 
quite a large number of war fleets 
sent against them. 

Nearly a quarter of the collective 
intelligence of the Arrogating Ones 
was devoted to plans to defeat these 
insects in battle. Most of the rest of 
their intelligence was devoted to the 
pleasant contemplation of what they 
would do to the insects after the 
battle was won to make them wish 
they hadn’t resisted so hard. 



W HILE the handsome white- 
haired gentleman was stalking 
Myron and Ellen, the second person 
who wanted, the Secretary of State 
of the United States of America, was 
about a hundred miles north of and 
40,000 feet above Central Park. He 
was on board a four-engined jet 
aircraft with the American flag em- 
blazoned on its prow and he was 
having a temper tantrum. 

The President of the United States 
was gloomily running his fingers be- 
tween the toes of his bare feet. 
“Shoot, Danny,” he said, “you’re 
getting yourself all hot about 
nothing. Tm not saying we can’t 
bomb Venezuela. I’m only saying 
why do we want to bomb Vene- 
zuela? And I’m saying you ought to 
watch how you talk to me, too.” 
“Watch how you talk to me, Mr. 
President!” shouted the Secretary of 
State over the noise of tire jets. “I’m 
pretty fed up with your procrastina- 
tions and delays and it wouldn’t take 
much for me to walk right out and 
dump the whole thing back in your 
lap. Considering your track record— I 
am thinking of Iceland— I don’t 
imagine you’d relish that prospect.” 
“Danny boy,” snarled the Presi- 
dent, “you’ve got a bad habit of 
digging up ancient history. Stick to 
the point. We’ve got to have oil, 
agreed. They have oil, everybody 
knows that. They don’t want to sell 
it to us at a reasonable price, so you 
want me to beat on them until they 
change their minds. Right? Only 
what you don’t see is, there’s a right 



90 



GALAXY 




way and a wrong way to do these 
things. Why can’t we just go in with 
some spooks and Tommy-guns, as 
usual?” 

“But their insolence, Mr. Presi- 
dent! The demeaning tone of' this 
document they sent me. It isn’t the 
oil, it is the national credibility of 
the country that is involved here.” 

“Right, Danny, riglit,” groaned 
the President. “You can talk. You 
don’t have Congress breathing down 
your neck at every little thing.” He 
sighed heavily and opened another 
can of no-calorie soda. “What I don’t 
see,” he said, with a punctuation 
mark of gas, “is why we have to hit 
them tonight, with Congress still in 
session.” 

The Secretary said petulantly, “I 
have explained to you, Mr. President, 
that our communications system is 
malfunctioning. We’ve lost global 
coverage. There is strong dissipation 
of ionosphere scatter, due to inter- 
ference from an unprecedentedly 
strong influx of radiation apparently 
emanating from—” 

“Oh, cut it out,” complained the 
President. “You mean it’s that comet 
that’s bollixed up our detection.” 

The Secretary pursed his lips. 
“Not precisely the comet, no, Mr. 
President. No such effect has ever 
been detected before, although it is 
possible that there is a connection. 
Doesn’t matter. The situation before 
us is that we do not have total 
communication at this time. And so 
we have no way of knowing whether 
the Venezuelans are treacherously 



planning a sneak attack or not. Do 
you want to take a chance on the 
security of the Free World, Mr. Presi- 
dent? I say preempt now!” 

“Yes, you’ve made your point, 
Danny,” said the President. He 
swiveled his armchair and gazed out 
at the bright spray of white light 
across the eastern horizon where 
Comet Ujifusa-McGinnis lay. “I’ve 
heard worse excuses for starting a 
war,” he mused, “but I can’t re- 
member exactly when. All right, 
Danny. We’ll do what you say. Get 
me Charlie on the scrambler and I’ll 
put in the attack in two hours.” 

T he watchers for the Arrogating 
Ones, hiding inside the pebbly 
core of the comet named after the 
two amateur astronomers who had 
simultaneously discovered it, studied 
the results of their radar-like scan of 
the Earth. This was routine. They 
were not aware that their scanning 
had damaged mankind’s communica- 
tions, but that was not their prob- 
lem. Their only task was to spray out 
a shower of particles and catch the 
returning ones to study— this they 
did, and what their study told them 
was that the planet Earth had 
reached redpoint status. It was now 
well into a technological age and was 
thus an active, rather than merely a 
potential, threat to their masters. 

The Arrogating Ones were no 
longer quite as effectively arrogant as 
they had once been. They had been 
creamed rather frequently in their 
millennia-long struggle against the 



SOME JOYS UNDER THE STAR 



91 




insectoids. The score was, roughly, 
Arrogating Ones 53, Insectoids 
23,724. The watchers, knowing this, 
were aware that at least their task 
would not under these circumstances 
involve the actual physical conquest 
of the Earth. It would simply be 
destroyed. 

This was no big deal. Plenty of 
mechanisms for wiping out a popu- 
lated planet were stockpiled in the 
arsenals of the Arrogating Ones. 
They had not worked very well 
against the insectoids, unfortunately, 
but they would be plenty powerful 
enough to deal with, say, mankind. 
The weapons for accomplishing this 
were readily available at any time, 
but not to the watchers, who were 
far too low in the liierarchy of 
authority to be trusted with anything 
like that. 

Their task was much simpler. They 
were only required to report what 
they saw and then to soften up the 
human race so that it would not be 
able to offer resistance, even ineffec- 
tual resistance, to the clean-up teams 
when they arrived with their planet- 
busters. 

Softening up was a technical prob- 
lem of some magnitude, but it had 
been solved long ago. The abducted 
humans had died messily but not in 
vain. At least, from the point of view 
of the Arrogating Ones their deaths 
had not been in vain, for in their 
dying agonies they had supplied 
information about themselves which 
had enabled the Arrogating Ones to 
devise appropriate softening-up me- 



chanisms. The watchers had been 
equipped with these on a standby 
basis ever since. 

Of course, from the point of view 
of the abducted humans the question 
of whether their deaths had been in 
vain might have had a different an- 
swer. No one had troubled to ask 
them. 

At any rate, the watchers now 
energized the generators which 
would soften up mankind for its 
destruction. 

While they were waiting for a 
charge to build up they looked up 
the coordinates and call signal for the 
nearest cruising superdreadnaught of 
the Arrogating Ones and transmitted 
a request for it to come in and finish 
up the job with a core-bomb. They 
tlien discussed among themselves the 
prospects of what their next assign- 
ment would be. It was not a fruitful 
discussion. Core-bombs are messy 
and there was not much chance that 
Comet Ujifusa-McGinnis’s orbit 
would get them far enough away to 
be out of its range when it went off. 
Even if they survived, none of them 
had any idea what the Arrogating 
Ones’ future plans for the watchers 
were. All they were sure of was that 
they were certain not to enjoy them. 

W E now turn to Albert Novak. 

He was in another four-engined 
jet, cUmbing to cruising altitude out 
of Kennedy en route to Los Angeles 
International. He was a crew-cut 
young man, with something on his 
mind. His neighbor was a short.

white-haired, dark-tanned Westerner 
with the face of a snapping turtle, 
who offered his hand and said ag- 
gressively, jerking his head toward 
the window, “That confounded 
thing! Do you know the space 
agency wants to spend thirty million 
dollars of your tax money just to go 
sniff around it? Thirty million 
dollars! Just to sniff some marsh gas! 
Not as long as I’m ' on the Aero- 
nautics and Space Committee. Let 
me introduce myself. I’m Congress- 
man—” But he was talking to gas 
himself. Albert Novak had not ac- 
cepted his hand, had not even met 
his eyes. Although the “Fasten Seat 
Belts” sign was still lighted in three 
languages, he unstrapped himself and 
walked down the aisle. Hostesses 
hissed at him and tardily began to 
unsnap themselves to make him re- 
turn to his seat. He ignored them. He 
had no intention of ever arriving at 
L.A. International and when he 
wanted to talk to a hostess he would 
do so on his own terms. He carried a 
cassette recorder into a toilet and 
locked the door against everyone. 

The cassette recorder could no 
longer be used to record or play. He 
had removed its insides tlie day 
before, replacing tliem with more 
batteries and a coil of fine wire, 
-which he now carefully connected to 
thirty Baggies full of dynamite and 
firing caps he had sewn into the 
lining of his trenchcoat while his 
mother nearsightedly smiled on him 
from across the room. 

Although Novak thought of him- 



self as a hijacker, it was not his 
intention to cause the jet to head for 
Cuba, Caracas or even Algiers. He did 
not want the airplane. He didn’t even 
want the one hundred million 
dollars’ ransom he planned to ask 
for. 

What Novak wanted, mostly, was 
to matter to somebody. As far as he 
had thought out his plan of action, it 
was to walk up to a stewardess with 
his hand on the detonating switch, 
show her the ingenious arrangement 
he had gotten past the metal de- 
tectors, be escorted to the flight deck 
in the traditional manner and then, 
after the airUne had begun trying to 
get together the 5,000,000 unmarked 
twenty-dollar bills he intended to 
demand and the maximum of annoy- 
ance and confusion had been caused, 
to close the switch and explode the 
dynamite. 

He knew that in destroying the 
airplane he would die. That was not 
very important to him. The one 
important failure that he regretted 
very much was that he would not be 
able to see his mother’s face when 
the reporters and TV crew began to 
swarm around her and she learned he 
had been pushing around all kinds of 
people and thirty million dollars’ 
worth of airplane. 

T he generators at the core of 
Comet Ujifusa-McGinnis were 
now up to full charge. 

Disgruntledly the watchers of the 
Arrogating Ones sighted the beam in 
on the planet Earth. They were quite 



SOME JOYS UNDER THE STAR 



93 




careful to get it aligned properly, for 
they remembered very well what the 
consequences were for slipshod 
work. When it was locked in tliey 
released the safety switch that 
allowed the contact to close that 
discharged the beam. 

More than three million watts of 
beamed power surged out toward the 
near hemisphere of the planet. Cer- 
tain chemical changes at once took 
place in the atmosphere and were 
borne by jet stream, trade winds and 
the aimless migration of air masses all 
around the Earth. 

The equipment used was highly 
directional, but the watchers who 
operated it were very close and large 
magnitudes of energy were involved. 
Some of the radiation sprayed them. 
There was some loss from corona 
points, some reflection even from the 
tenuous gases of the comet’s halo. 

As the radiation had been designed 
specifically for use against mankind, 
on tlie basis of the experiments 
conducted on the kidnappees of two 
thousand years before, it was only of 
limited effect on the watchers. But 
they happened to be warmblooded 
oxygen-breathers with two sexes and 
many of humanity’s hangups, so that 
the weapon did do to them much 
what it was intended to do to man- 
kind. 

First tliey felt a sudden, sharp 
pang of an emotion which they 
identified (but only by logical deduc- 
tion) as joy. The diagnosis was not 
simple, for they had little in their 
lives that would enable them to 



recognize such a state. But they 
looked at each other with fatuous 
fondness and, in their not really very 
human ways, shared pleasure. 

The next thing they shared was 
serious physical pain, accompanied 
by vomiting, dizziness and a feeling 
of weakness, for they were receiving 
a great deal more of the radiation 
than was necessary for the mere task 
of turning them into pussycats to 
receive the knockout blow of the 
Arrogating Ones. They recognized 
that, too. They deduced that they 
were dying, and doing it pretty fast. 

They did not mind that any more 
than Albert Novak minded blowing 
himself up with the airliner. It was 
worthwhile. They were happy. It was 
what the ray was intended to do to 
people and it did its work very well. 

AND all over the near side of the 
Jl\. Earth, as the radiation searched 
out and saturated humanity, joy re- 
placed fear, peace replaced tension, 
love replaced anger. 

In Central Park three slum youths 
released the girl they had lured be- 
lund the 72d Street boat house and 
decided to apply for Harvard, while a 
member of the Tactical Patrol Force 
lay down on Umpire Rock and gazed 
jubilantly at the comet. At the park’s 
southern margin the white-haired 
gentleman came leaping out at 
Myron Landau and his girl. “My dear 
children!” he cried, tugging the 
women’s stocking off his face. “How 
sweet and tender you are. You re- 
mind me so much of my own be- 



94 



GALAXY 




loved son and daughters that you 
must let me stand you to the best 
hotel room in New York, with un- 
limited room service.” 

This spectacle would normally 
have disconcerted Myron Landau, 
especially as he had just succeeded in 
solving the puzzle of Ellen’s bra snap. 
But he was so filled with the sudden 
rapture himself that he could only 
say, “You bet you can, friend. But 
only if you come with us. Ellen and I 
wouldn’t have it any other way.” 

And Ellen chimed in sweetly: 
“What do we need a motel room for, 
mister? Why don’t we just get out of 
these clothes?” 

Forty thousand feet directly over- 
head, as the Presidential jet sped 
back from the Summer Wliite House 
near Boothbay Harbor, Maine, the 
Secretary of State lifted eyes stream- 
ing with joy and said, “Dear Mr. 
President, let’s give the spies another 
chance. It’s too nice a night to be 
H-bombing Caracas.” And the Presi- 
dent, flinging an arm around him, 
sobbed, “Danny, as a diplomat 
you’re not worth a bucket of warm 
snot, but I’ve always said you’ve got 
the biggest damn heart in the cabi- 
net.” 

A great bubble of orange-yellow 
flame off on the western horizon 
disconcerted them for a moment, but 
it did not seem relevant to their 
transcendental joy. They began sing- 
ing all the good old favorites like 
Down By the Old Mill Stream, Sweet 
Adeline and I’ve Been Working on 
the Railroad, and had so much fun 



doing it that the President quite 
forgot to radio the message that 
would cancel his strike order against 
Caracas. It did not matter very much. 
The B-52 ordnance crews had 
dumped the bombs from the fork 
lifts and were now giving each other 
rides on them, while the command- 
ing general of the strike, Curtis T. 
“Vinegar Ass” Pinowitz, had decided 
he preferred going fishing to para- 
chuting into Venezuela in support of 
the bombing. He was looking for his 
spinning reel, oblivious to the noise 
on the hardstand where the 101st 
Airborne was voting whether to fly 
to Disneyland or the Riviera. (In any 
event, the Venezuelans, or those 
members of the Venezuelan govern- 
ment who were bothering to answer 
their telephones, had just voted to 
give the Yankees all the oil they 
wanted and were seriously consider- 
ing scenting it with jasmine.) 

The ball of flame on the horizon, 
however, was not without its impor- 
tance. 

Arnold Novak had released the 
armlock he had got around the little 
brown-eyed stewardess’s neck and 
had begun to try to explain to her 
that his intention to blow up the jet 
meant nothing personal, but was 
only a way of inducing his mother to 
pay as much attention to him as she 
had, all through their lives, to his 
brother, Dick. Although he stam- 
mered so that he was almost inco- 
herent, the stew understood him at 
once. She, too, had had both a 
mother and an older brother. Her 



SOME JOYS UNDER THE STAR 



95 




pretty brown eyes filled with tears of 
sympathy and with a rush of love she 
flung her arms around him. “You 
poor boy,” she cried, covering his 
stubbly face with kisses. “Here, 
honey! Let me help you.” And she 
caught the cassette from his hand, 
careful not to pull the wires loose, 
and closed the switch that touched 
off the caps in all the thirty Baggies. 

One hundred and thirty-one men, 
women and children simultaneously 
were converted into maltreated 
chunks of barbecued meat falling 
through the sky. Their roster in- 
cluded the pilot, the co-pilot, the 
third pilot and eight other members 
of the flight crew; plus, among the 
passengers, mothers, infants, honey- 
mooning couples, non-honey- 
mooning but equally amorous 
couples who did not happen to be 
married to each other, a middle-aged 
grape picker returning home after a 
five-days-four-nights all-expense tour 
of Sin City (which he had found 
disappointing), a defrocked priest, a 
disbarred lawyer and a Congressman 
from Oregon who would never now 
achieve his dream of dismantling 
NASA and preventing the further 
waste of the taxpayer’s funds on 
space, which he held to be empty 
and uninteresting. 

Whoever they had been when 
whole, the pieces of barbecue all 
looked pretty much alike now. It did 
not matter. Not one of the passen- 
gers or crew had died unhappy, since 
they had aU been touched by the 
comet. 



AND deep inside the core of the 
comet Ujifusa-McGinnis, the de- 
vice which was meant to display the 
wave forms signifying receipt of the 
destruction order for Earth remained 
blank. No signal was received. No 
one would have observed it if it had 
been, certainly not the watchers, but 
it was unprecedented that a response 
should not be received. 

The reason was quite simple. It 
was that that particular superdread- 
naught of the Arrogating Ones, like 
most of the otliers in their galactic 
fleet, had long since been hurled 
against the fortresses of the in- 
sectoids of the core. There, like the 
others, it had been quickly de- 
stroyed, so that the message sent by 
the watchers had never reached its 
destination. 

It was, in a way, too bad, to think 
of aU that strength and sagacity spent 
with no more tangible visible result 
than to give pleasure to a few billion 
advanced primates. Although this 
was regrettable, it did not much 
bother the Arrogating Ones. They 
had plenty of other regrets to work 
on. What remained of their collective 
intelligence was fully taken up with 
the problem of bare survival against 
the insectoid fleets- plus, to be sure, 
a good deal of attention given to 
mutual recrimination. 

The watchers did not mind; they 
had long, since perished of acute 
terminal pleasure. 

And, as it turned out, they had 
not died entirely in vain. 

Because the Oregon congressman 



96 



GALAXY 




did not live to complete his plan to 
dismantle NASA, aU his seniority and 
horse-trading power having perished 
with him, the projected comet-study 
mission was not canceled. To be sure, 
the bird did not fly on schedule. The 
effects of the joy beams from the 
comet did not begin to wear off for 
several days and the NASA techni- 
cians simply could not be bothered 
while their joy was in its manic 
phase. 

But gradually the world re- 
turned to— normal? No. It was defi- 
nitely not normal for everyone to be 
feeling rather cheerful most of the 
time. But the world settled down, 
sweetly and fondly, to something not 
unlike its previous condition of work 
and play. So^ the astronauts found 
another launch window and made 
rendezvous with the comet; and what 
they found there made quite a differ- 
ence in the history of both the 
human race and the galaxy. The 
watchers were gone, but they had 
left their weaponry behind. 

When the astronauts returned with 
the least and weakest of the wea- 
pons, all they could cram into their 
ship, the President of the United 
States gave up his shuffleboard game 
to-, fly to the deck of the Indepen- 
dence and stare at it. “Oh, boy!” he 
chortled, awed and thrilled. “If 
that’d turned up two months ago 
Brazil would’ve had a seaport on the 
Caribbean!” But Venezuela went 
about its business untouched. The 
President was tempted. Even cheerful 
and at peace with himself and the 



world, he was tempted— old habits 
die hard. But he had several thoughts 
and the longest and most persuasive 
of them was that weaponry like this 
meant that somewhere there was an 
enemy who had constructed and 
deployed it and some day might 
return to use it. So with some mis- 
givings, but without any real freedom 
of choice, he flew back to Washing- 
ton, summoned the ambassadors of 
Venezuela, Cuba, Canada, the 
U.S.S.R., the People’s Republic of 
China and the United Irish Republics 
of Great Britain and laid everything 
before them. 

Although politicians, too, were 
residually cheerful still from the ef- 
fect of the comet, they had not lost 
their intelligence. They quickly saw 
that there was an external foe— some- 
where— which made each of them 
look like a very good friend. Nobody 
was in a mood to fool with little 
international wars. So treaties were 
signed, funds were appropriated, con- 
struction was begun. 

And the human race, newly armed 
and provided with excellent space- 
ships, went looking for the Arro- 
gating Ones. 

They did not, of course, find 
them. By the time they were ready 
to make their move, the last of the 
Arrogating Ones had gone resentfully 
to his death. But a good many 
generations later humans found the 
insectoids of the core instead and 
what then happened to the insectoids 
would have satisfied even the Arro- 
gating Ones. ★

SCIENCE EE A TURE 



ECLIPSE EXPEDITION 
INTO THE SAHARA 



A first-hand account of that 
historic trek to Mauritania in 
pursuit of lunar shadow! 



ERNEST TAVES 



E clipses of the sun, be they 
partial, annular, or (above all) 
total, are one of nature’s great spec- 
taculars. In ancient times eclipses 
were regarded as portents— now, to 
contemporary astronomers and astro- 
physicists, they are rare and un- 
exampled opportunities to learn 
more about the nature of the uni- 
verse, including such matters as the 
thermonuclear processes taking place 
within the sun and its complex at- 
mosphere. 

The total solar eclipse of June 
30th, 1973 was notable in that its 
period of totality— seven minutes and 
four seconds— tied for second place 
as the longest in the last 1 ,433 years. 
The moon’s shadow first touched 
Earth just after dawn, in South 
America, near the border of Guyana. 
It then swept across the Atlantic 
Ocean to strike the African coast at 
Mauritania. The path of totality con- 
tinued through drought-stricken 



Mali, Algeria, Niger, and Chad, then 
across the Central African Republic, 
Sudan, Uganda, Kenya and the So- 
mali Republic. The moon’s shadow 
left Earth, at sunset, in the Indian 
Ocean. 

(Some scientists pursued the 
shadow eastward over Africa in 
speedy aircraft, thus observing up to 
seventy-two minutes of totality, 
something new in eclipse history.) 

Though much of the country 
through which the shadow passed 
was inhospitable or downright hos- 
tile, numerous expeditions were 
mounted to record and study this 
eclipse. One of these, under the 
direction of Dr. Donald H. Menzel, 
and sponsored by the Harvard 
College Observatory, the Smith- 
sonian Astrophysical Observatory, 
and the National Geographic Society, 
was based in the Sahara Desert eight 
miles northeast of Akjoujt, Mauri- 
tania. I was privileged to accompany 



100 



GALAXY 




this expedition as Assistant Director. 

Through the organization of logis- 
tics by Educational Expeditions In- 
ternational, with the cooperation of 
Quest 4, an England-based profes- 
sional expedition outfitter, more 
than thirty amateur enthusiasts were 
able to participate in this venture 
into the desert. 

The personnel of the expedition 
comprised a scientific staff of eleven, 
the group of more than thirty ama- 
teurs, a number of media representa- 
tives, an Educational Expeditions In- 
ternational staff of seven and a Quest 
4 staff of eight. For this expedition 
Quest 4 traveled by land and ferry 
from England to the eclipse site in a 
caravan of Land Rovers, Range 
Rovers and Bedford lorries. 

The prime, though not the only, 
mission of an eclipse expedition is to 
record and study an array of phe- 
nomena related to the solar atmos- 
phere, which is visible only when the 
sun is entirely occulted by the moon. 
(Though an eclipse may, to a degrefe, 
be simulated by a coronagraph— a 
telescope fitted with a number of 
devices, including filters and an oc- 
culting disk— there is no substitute 
for the genuine article.) 

The solar atmosphere includes the 
chromosphere (the gaseous envelope 
surrounding the sun immediately 
outside of the photosphere) and the 
corona (the luminous envelope be- 
yond the chromosphere). Their study 
requires an extensive assemblage of 
instruments, including telescopes, 
cameras and spectrographs. This ap- 
paratus varies in size, but some are 
large and must be mounted upon 
concrete piers, whose construction is 
something of a problem in the Sa- 
hara. Oddly enough, one of the 



problems is obtaining the right kind 
of sand. Sand is everywhere, but the 
typical Saharan sand is not suitable 
for the mixing of high-quality con- 
crete. 

To study the solar atmosphere 
during this eclipse the expedition 
transported to the desert, among 
other instruments, a number of spec- 
trographs and an eight-inch off-axis 
Cassegrain 35-foot focal length tele- 
scope. 

A secondary mission of the ex- 
pedition was to conduct an Intra- 
mercurial Object Search, whose pur- 
pose was to attempt to discover 
hitherto unknown celestial objects 
(perhaps a tenth planet, undiscovered 
as yet, but tentatively named 
Vulcan) between the orbit of Mer- 
cury and the sun, such objects also 
being visible only during total solar 
eclipse. For this study an equa- 
torially mounted K-38 aerial camera 
was used. 

Yet another mission, which was 
my particular responsibility, was to 
perform for the Ionospheric Physics 
Laboratory of the Air Force Cam- 
bridge Research Laboratories an ex- 
periment to determine the effect of 
the eclipse upon the Faraday polari- 
zation of a (nominal) 137 mFlz radio 
signal transmitted to the eclipse site 
(and elsewhere, of course) by a geo- 
stationary communications satellite 
(Intersat 2F3) approximately over- 
head. This required the use of two 
seven-element Yagi antennas, a pol- 
arization tracking receiver and a 
two-channel recorder. 

The satellite provided a convenient 
source of a polarized radio signal. 
The elements of the two Yagi an- 
tennas, mounted on a single boom, 
were at right angles to each other. As 



ECLIPSE EXPEDITION INTO THE SAHARA 



101 




the radio signal passed through the 
ionosphere its plane of polarization 
was rotated, as a function of the 
Total Electron Content (TEC), in 
accordance with the Faraday Effect. 
Thus the signal would be received 
relatively strongly or weakly by the 
two antennas, depending on its state 
of polarization. The point of the 
experiment was, then, to measure the 
effect of the eclipse on the TEC of 
the ionosphere . 

In fact, though the eclipse was 
total on the ground, preliminary cal- 
culations indicate that it was but 
98.57% total at the ionosphere— an 
arbitrary distance from the Earth’s 
surface of 420 kilometers was used 
for this calculation. The outputs 
from each antenna were separately 
fed into a pen-and-ink recorder and 
for ten days the sawtooth patterns 
appearing on the chart paper were 
the focal point of my daily activities. 

M auritania is a desert coun- 
try, inhabited by about one 
million one hundred thousand 
people. The population is eighty per 
cent Moorish, of mixed Arab and 
Berber stock. Negroes comprise 
about twenty per cent of the popula- 
tion. The official language of the 
country is the Hassaniyah dialect of 
Arabic, but the working language is 
French. Population density is less 
than three per square mile, one of 
the lowest in Africa. Life expectancy 
is forty to forty-five years. 

This is a land of eight million 
sheep and goats, and 700,000 
camels— at least this was so before 
the present drought, which has af- 
flicted the country for years. Because 
of the drought animals are dying and 
nomads, threatened by the decima- 



tion of their herds, are moving to- 
ward the towns. A massive interna- 
tional relief effort is now under way. 
If it does not succeed many Mauri- 
tanians will die of famine. 

To get to Akjoujt from the eastern 
United States— from where most of 
the equipment and many of the 
participants came— one jets from JFK 
to Dakar, Senegal. Here you sit in the 
terminal building for some hours 
waiting for an Air Afrique plane to 
carry you north to Nouakchott, the 
capital of the now independent 
Islamic Republic of Mauritania. And 
if you have not been in this clime 
before, getting off that plane, any 
time near midday, is a memorable 
experience. I thought I was walking 
into the exhaust of a jet engine, but 
it was only the proximity of the 
desert. 

From Nouakchott one proceeds 
about 150 miles northeast to Akjoujt 
by Land Rover or other rugged ve- 
hicle, carrying a plentiful supply of 
water and of gasoline. Our hegira 
thence was most welcomely in- 
terrupted by the hospitality of Am- 
bassador Richard W. Murphy, who 
thoughtfully placed the amenities of 
the embassy, including a swimming 
pool, at our disposal. 

The road from Nouakchott to 
Akjoujt is one of the very few 
hard-surfaced roads in the entire 
country. Along the way you see the 
inevitable camels, flocks of goats, an 
occasional cluster of bedouin tents. 
Otherwise it’s sand, scrub, and wind. 
It doesn’t take long to understand 
that water and shade are the keys to 
survival. 

Akjoujt is a company mining town 
situated near an extensive deposit of 
rich copper ore. The company is 



102 



GALAXY 




Somima, partly owned by the Mauri- 
tanian government, partly by Anglo- 
American. Akjoujt is an oasis and 
there is water underground, but the 
principal water supply is piped from 
a distant source— a potentially 
hazardous situation, as we were to 
learn later. 

The expedition encampment, a 
colorful assemblage of many small 
tents and two large ones, was located 
about eight miles northeast of 
Akjoujt, a few hundred yards off the 
crude graveled road leading to Atar. 
An advance party had preceded us 
and when we arrived packing cases 
were strewn about, cameras were 
everywhere, and telescopes, coelo- 
stats, and other apparatus were all 
around. 

Sand gets into everything in the 
desert, which makes an astronomic 
venture a challenging one to the 
investigator and to his instruments, 
which must be housed, protected and 
unendingly brushed free of sand. An 
entirely lightproof film holders, left 
for any time in the desert wind, will 
accumulate within itself a trouble- 
some amount of fine sand. Materials 
to hand and the limited suppUes 
available in Akjoujt were used to 
construct shelters and housing for 
much of the gear. 

The expedition force was by no 
means isolated from the community 
of Akjoujt. Members of the scientifi'c 
staff made a presentation to the 
grade-school children, and Dr. 
Menzel gave slide-accompanied lec- 
tures to both the European and the 
native adults. We passed out hun- 
dreds of protective viewing filters to 
the friendly Moors. 

Nor were we entirely isolated from 
the rest of the world. Thanks to the 



efforts of our Communications Offi- 
cer, Lee Davy (W4FCU), an amateur 
radio station— our sole contact with 
the outside— was in operation 
throughout the expedition, using the 
call 5T5EEI. Special permission to 
handle third-party traffic was granted 
to this station, for the duration of 
the expedition, by the Mauritanian 
government and the Federal Com- 
munications Commission. Thus ex- 
pedition participants were able at 
times to be in touch, via radio-tele- 
phone, with their families. 

The plan was for this station to be 
operated at the campsite, but again 
conditions made this impossible. The 
station was maintained in Akjoujt in 
the temporary Porta-Van home of 
Jean-Pierre Coulondre

teur radio operation in Mauritania 
and a very good friend of the expedi- 
tion, to whom we owe much.

O N ANY eclipse expedition there 
is always the chance, of course, 
that the entire effort will be wiped 
out, possibly at the very last minute, 
by bad weather. Dr. Menzel’s record— 
and no one has seen more eclipses 
than he, though one astronomer is 
tied (Charles H. Smiley of the Ladd 
Observatory, Brown Univer- 
sity)— was, prior to this ecUpse, 
eleven successful expeditions out of 
fourteen tries. At our site the pre- 
ecUpse information available indi- 
cated these conditions: airborne dust 
present an average of seven days in 
June, three days in July; no signifi- 
cant rain in Akjoujt for the last

eleven years; haze commonly pre- 
sent; now and then an overwhelming 
sandstorm. The consensus among the 
scientists was that the odds favoring 
a reasonable clear view were about 
seven or eight out of ten. 

The lowest night temperature 
noted at the expedition site was 
79°F. but the average low was consid- 
erably above that. On at least one 
occasion the midnight temperature 
was 108°. Midday temperatures 
ranged approximately from 105° to 
115°. Accordingly, the expedition 
plan called for air conditioning in the 
desert. An echpse expedition must 
have, of course, a photographic dark- 
room since procedures must be tried 
out first, under ambient conditions, 
to ensure success at the moment of 
totality. Some apparatus works weU 
the first time, some doesn’t. Light 
leaks, for example, occur in discon- 
certing places— these must be 
remedied. We were to have our air- 
conditioned darkroom, plus an air- 
conditioned work tent, at the camp- 
site. But if things can go wrong they 
will, as is known, and in this case the 
generators provided were totally in- 
adequate to power the too-large air 
conditioners. 

An air-conditioned apartment was 
available in the Somima enclave in 
Akjoujt— this was meant to house Dr. 
and Mrs. Menzel. And it did, but it 
also housed the darkroom— into 
which the kitchen was converted. Let 
the record show that Mrs. Menzel 
accepted tliis intensive violation of 
her kitchen with grace. The apart- 
ment also housed my temperature- 
sensitive polarization receiver, which 
would have failed to operate at 
desert temperatures. It also housed 
me, since a close eye on my tempera- 



mental apparatus was required. 

AT DUSK on Thursday, June 28th, 
two days before the eclipse, 
there occurred a sandstorm of suffi- 
cient severity to cause the cancella- 
tion of a scheduled rehearsal of the 
procedures to be undertaken by the 
expedition personnel during the 
eclipse. On Friday, the day before 
the eclipse, weather conditions at 
what would be eclipse time the next 
day were marginal. The sun was 
visible, but not clearly so, and people 
walked about with fingers crossed. 

On eclipse day the sun rose at 06 
21 Universal Time (UT) which was 
also Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) 
locally. One hour after sunrise the 
haze and cloud cover were such that 
I— eight miles from the expedition 
site, alone at my air-conditioned ap- 
paratus— could safely examine the 
sun with the naked eye. This was not 
good and this condition obtained 
through 08 00 hours. Worse, at 09 
00, twenty-five minutes before first 
contact (the moment when the moon 
begins to occult the sun) the sun was 
completely obscured by cloud. At 09 
15 the sun was barely visible through 
a high-density filter. The cloud cover 
tlien disappeared as if by miracle and 
at first contact— 09 25 06 UT— the 
sun was clearly visible through light 
haze, with some remnants of the 
cloud cover passing over the solar 
disk. By second contact— the be- 
ginning of totality, at 10 41 11— con- 
ditions were very good. The sun was 
eclipsed and the corona shone forth. 

Whether you have previously seen 
no eclipses— or fourteen— the appear- 
ance of the corona surrounding the 
dark of the occulting moon is, 
simply, stunning. Missing the excite-

ment of the group activity at the 
expedition site, I shared these extra- 
vagant moments with two members 
of the Mauritanian equivalent of our 
National Guard, assigned to protect 
our quarters from ‘undesirables’— of 
which we at no time saw any evi- 
dence. I explained that it was now 
possible to view the spectacle with- 
out protection. We stood there, a 
quiet group of three, each lost in his 
own thoughts. 

Then, at 10 47 16, after more than 
six minutes of totality, came the 
brilliant flash of the sun’s reappear- 
ance. 1 shouted a warning to the 
gendarmerie to use their filters 
henceforth and dashed inside to my 
instruments to mark the time. Condi- 
tions remained good until fourth 
contact— the moment at wliich the 
disk of the sun is again entire— at 12 
13 17. Shortly thereafter there was 
a moderate sandstorm. The expedi- 
tion had lucked through. 

O N an eclipse expedition into the 
Sahara things do go wrong, how- 
ever, before, during, and after the 
main event. I have mentioned the 
water supply to Akjoujt (and to the 
expedition site— the expedition’s 
large water bladders were filled in 
Akjoujt). A few days before the 
eclipse the pipeline failed, some sixty 
miles from Akjoujt. A tank of con- 
siderable size, perched upon a hill 
near the copper mine, kept the water 
running untU the next day— when the 
faucets went dry. It is not pleasant to 
have your water supply threatened in 
the Sahara. Mineral water was in 
great demand and bathtubs and all 
other available containers had been 
filled in advance. And, at vast ex- 
pense, the mine had been forced to 



shut down— the familiar clouds of 
smoke were not to be seen. 

It was said that the site of the 
failure was in a low place, thus 
creating a small lake, to which ani- 
mals came to drink from miles 
around. To restore water to the town 
the lake had to be pumped out and 
the pipeline had to be emptied and 
repaired. And this was done. Within 
forty-eight hours the faucets were 
running again and smoke was coming 
from the mine -a pleasant sight, en- 
vironmental considerations apart. 
The mine can’t operate without enor- 
mous amounts of water. 

Other things went wrong. A spec- 
trograph shutter jammed ten minutes 
before totality. At least one other 
important camera failed and could 
not be made to operate in time for 
totality. Conditions reasonably good 
for spectrographic study were prob- 
ably not adequate for the Intra- 
mercurial Search. Robert Fisher, who 
was in charge of this program, was 
able, however, during totality, to 
view a fourth-magnitude tracking 
star. At this writing the films have 
not been developed, but Fischer’s 
present attitude is one of cautious 
optimism. In general, the consensus 
of the scientists was that the expedi- 
tion was a success. 

Most of the important films were 
brought back to the States for pro- 
cessing and the results obtained are 
unavailable at the time this is 
written. My own experiment— which 
was expected to be workable in any 
weather condition— was apparently 
successful; the data have been partly 
reduced, though the baseline for 
comparison has not yet been estab- 
hshed. Prehminary indications are 
that minimum electron content oc-

curred— to the nearest minute— at 
10:44, some five minutes after the 
appearance of almost 99% totality in 
the ionosphere. This is a smaller time 
delay than expected, but these mea- 
surements have not been made in 
such near-equatorial latitudes before , 
It is hoped that the results of this 
experiment will be pubhshed shortly. 

Some films were developed in the 
kitchen-darkroom before breaking 
camp. Jonathan Kern, using a six- 
inch refractor fed by a ten-inch 
single -mirror coelostat, obtained 
some striking photographs of the 
corona, clearly showing the presence 
of streamers— which are characteristic 
of coronas seen at sunspot minimum. 
Kern used, for his photography of 
the corona, a radial filter located in 
the focal plane of the optical system, 
whose purpose was to attenuate the 
Ught of the inner corona by a factor 
of about 700, in order to obtain 
useful photographs of the outer 
corona out to about four sun radii. 

It is not, however, my intention to 
dwell here on the technical aspects of 
the expedition. I have wished, rather 
to give a general idea of how it is to 
mount an eclipse expedition into a 
hostile environment. 

I spoke later on eclipse day to 
those who had been at the camp and 
was told of a variety of happenings. 
A number of Bedouins were there, 
and as the moon began to occult the 
sun they turned toward Mecca in 
prayer. Prayer for what I don’t be- 
lieve anyone discovered. They com- 
pleted their obeisances well before 
the time of totality, which they 
watched with rapt interest. 

And, even as at Cape Kennedy, 
where an ancient black, present at 
the launch site, denied any possi- 



bihty that the Apollo mission was 
going to the moon, so an elderly 
Bedouin declared that the sun could 
not and would not be eclipsed. Later, 
faced with the awesome reahty, he 
said, “Well, the Americans are very 
powerful.” 

Thinking about the end of the 
expedition, impressions come fast and 
tend to coalesce. On eclipse night 
there was a lamb barbecue, with 
Moors wielding murderous knives 
with a skill reminding me of chefs in 
first-class Japanese restaurants. Then, 
next morning, another ride through 
150 miles of desert to Nouakchott, 
and again a welcome from Am- 
bassador Murphy, a dedicated diplo- 
mat deeply concerned about Mauri- 
tanian problems. His hospitality will 
be remembered by many. 

That afternoon Dr. Menzel was 
awarded, by President Moktar Ould 
Daddah, the Mauritanian Medal of 
Honor. 

Then to the airport, and the usual 
interminable delay. Finally we were 
allowed to board an Air Afrique 
Caravelle. Every seat was taken, and 
one or two persons squatted in the 
aisle. And— the cargo compartment 
being fuU— a number of large chests 
(containing films exposed but not 
processed, cooled by dry ice) were 
brought on board and put into places 
not normally utilized for baggage. 

From my seat I could see the 
runway ahead, but I averted my gaze 
at takeoff. I think, though, that the 
pilot, who wore a worried expression 
upon his black countenance, used 
every inch of it. I had never before, 
on any flight, heard a round of 
applause and cheers as the aircraft 
became airborne. I did now, and my 
cheers were as loud as any. ★

In the photograph on this page you 
may note how Playboy sees Ernest H. 
Taves, M.D.; master of sophisticated prose 
and connoisseur of French wines. In the 
pages preceding you may observe him as 
science and science fiction see him: a 
dedicated researcher of Earth's environs— 
French for "out there." 

Speaking of views of Ernest— to the 
reader who wrote in following Galaxy's 
publication of Mayflower One (Nov. '73) 
to ask if Ernest Taves could be a nom de 
plume of Theodore Sturgeon the answer is 
no, it could not. Everybody would object, 
including us. But with this issue the two 
men come to share one distinction: Ernest 
becomes the second author with a wide 
enough range to have his byline appear 
twice in the same issue of Galaxy. Ted lent 
us his strength twice in October. 

So much for our side. 

Here is Ernest: 

"I began writing science fiction later 
than most and came to this activity via a 
circuitous route. I was born and raised in 
the Snake River Valley of southeastern 
Idaho, but during college years gravitated 
to New York City— Columbia College and 
University, where I obtained a number of 
degrees. My interest at that time was in 
fixperimental psychology and I was also 
into parapsychology, to which I devoted 
considerable time. I received the first (and 
only, as far as I know) M.A. degree 
granted by the Department of Psychology 
lor parapsychological research. My Ph.D 
from the same institution was more legiti- 
mate, having to do with visual perception. 

"I abandoned academic life in favor of 
medical school, took a medical degree 
from New York University. This led into 
military service and eighteen months in 
Yokohama as Chief of the Neuropsy- 
chiatric Service of the 155th Station Hos- 
pital. After discharge came psychoanalytic 
training, followed by some twenty years 
of practice, first in New York, later in 
Cambridge, Massachusetts. 

"I had wanted to write during those 
years, but in the press of other circum- 
stance had never really gotten into it. 
Now, in the view that twenty years is 
bnough to spend doing any one thing, I

phased out of medical practice and into 
writing. 

"I sold my first short story (not science 
fiction) to Playboy in 1969. This hooked 
me on writing. Then, having been inter- 
ested for decades in the mysteries of 
Stonehenge, I wrote a science fiction story 
about that (Second-hand Stonehenge) , 
which was bought by Galaxy. And this 
hooked me on science fiction. 

"I'm married and my wife and I divide 
our time between Cambridge and New 
Hampshire (where we are much involved 
with conservation) and, now and then, 
other parts of the world. We have one son, 
Henry, a physics major at Harvard. One of 
his many current interests is to restore the 
railroad to contemporary America. 

"My own other interests include astron- 
omy, electronics, amateur radio, chess, 
French wines and other disciplines beyond 
mention."

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

John Devlin is awakened from 
cold sleep by ship’s computerized 
system and told he’s seventy-five 
years into mission: man’s first at- 
tempt to colonize a star system other 
than his own. He is computer-instruc- 
ted to check ship ’s systems, then his 
own voluntary; involuntary bodily 
functions, circulation, sensorium, 
speech organ and memory. His 
period of awakening is for one hour. 
During this time he is to speak, 
exercise and try to remember his 



cold-sleep dream. In his dream he 
was a primitive, ocean-dwelling life 
form, inordinately hungry -and was 
himself eaten by a carnivorous cepha- 
lopod while eating a trilobite. 

His second awakening comes 282 
years into mission. His instructions 
are as before, but in addition he’s 
told to go to the ship ’s control center 
to evaluate target system #3. The 
ship’s computer had bypassed the 
first two target star systems as un- 
suitable for human colonization. 
Number 3 is a perfect. Earth-type 
planet, unpolluted and verdant-but

is entering Roche’s limit and will 
soon break up to become a ring 
system around its primary. DEVLIN 
rules no landing, obediently remem- 
bers last cold-sleep dream: in it he 
was an enormous brontosaurus and 
was killed by a small, carnivorous 
allosaurus. 

On his next awakening-323 years 
into mission-he is told to check a 
malfunction in Blue 31, a colonist 
cubicle, and discovers Colonist 
YVONNE CALDWELL, 18 biologi- 
cal years old, improperly frozen and 
dying. At the end of her last waking 



period she had tried to communicate 
with her boy friend, also a colonist, 
and had not made it to her cold-sleep 
casket in time. DEVLIN makes her 
death as comfortable as he can. 
Before returning to cold sleep he is 
required to remember a complete 
day in his life before starting on 
mission. 

He had been a physician and re- 
members three instances of violence 
he had attended on an Earth made 
uninhabitable by its inhabitants: IJa 
young man wounded as a bystander 
in a duel between his father and 



111 



father-in-law; 2) a lovely voung girl, 
PATRICIA MORLEY, who had dis- 
figured her face to discourage mur- 
derous duels between her suitors; 3) 
a dead boy, victim of a chance bullet 
fired during riot in a distant part of 
town. During the same day he also 
meets a rather mysterious man 
known as BROTHER HOWARD. 

DEVLIN’S fourth awakening is for 
the purpose of evaluating another 
possible habitable star system. The 
system is already inhabited by highly 
technologically advanced aliens who 
have polluted it and send spacecraft 
to destroy DEV LIN 's ship. He per- 
forms evasive action. 

IX 

I T SEEMED to Devlin that all his 
life had been spent trying to pass 
tests, failing most of them— and then 
trying to escape the results of the 
failures. He was trying to escape the 
latest failure by fleeing into cold 
sleep, but the computer was being 
awkward. 

NEGATIVE TO REQUEST EOR IM- 
MEDIATE COOLDOWN. CARRY OUT 
INSTRUCTION REMEMBER. COOL- 
DOWN IN ONE HOUR THIRTY-LIVE 
MINUTES. 

Devlin did not want to remember 
anything, neither his own past life 
nor the bright, pleasant and often 
agonizing dream lives. The process of 
memory was one of the Devlin or- 
ganic systems capable of being 
checked by a temporary Hold, but it 
could not be switched off. 

Not only was it becoming im- 



possible for him to forget anything 
of importance, but even the most 
trivial incidents were coming back to 
him with a clarity and intensity that 
made him wonder if someone— or 
some medically programed process— 
could be feeding him psycho-aug- 
menter drugs. He did not know and 
he could be sure of nothing. His only 
means of defense against a recall of 
too-painful memories was to concen- 
trate on one of the less unpleasant 
days in his life. 

The day he had decided to recall 
had begun pleasantly. There were 
only three patients in morning sur- 
gery and he had no private visits 
scheduled. The preceding two weeks 
had seen a sudden upsurge in block 
security casualties and affairs of 
honor within the building, but now 
the area was entering a period of 
relative sanity which, experience had 
taught him, might last for a few days. 
His last patient had been Patricia 
Morley, the girl with the lacerated 
cheek. 

“It is healing nicely,” Devhn said 
as he renewed the dressing, “but 
there will be scars. Are you sure you 
won’t have plastic surgery?” 

“No,” she said firmly. 

This was her fourth visit to the 
surgery and he had twice spoken to 
her in the recreation hall, so that 
their time togetlier totaled no more 
than three hours. Her face was no 
longer giving her pain and, although 
she still considered her reason for 
inflicting the wound a good one, she 
remained normal enough to want to 



112 



GALAXY 




hide the scars behind a no longer 
necessary dressing. Soon she would 
cease to need him as a doctor. Devlin 
was glad about that, but a little 
worried that she might have to swap 
him for a psychiatrist. 

Sufferers in silence, even those 
who could do so without complaint 
or outward show of distress, were 
still sufferers. 

It was clear that she wanted to 
talk about her problem— which was, 
fundamentally, a non-surgical one— 
and she was not a waller, a martyr to 
misfortune or a potential suicide. 
Devlin would not in the least mind 
listening to her, but in their present 
surroundings the conversation stayed 
on a much too clinical level. 

“It’s a fine, sunny day,” said 
Devlin. “I advise you to get some 
fresh air and exercise in the district 
park.” 

She laughed at that because the 
fresli air of the city was anything 
but— and compared unfavorably with 
the cooled and filtered hurricane that 
whistled continually from the build- 
ing’s main air ducts. 

“It is three miles away,” Devlin 
went on, “which should be exercise 
enough if you go on foot. But to 
make sure that you are following 
doctor’s orders I shall call at the park 
on my way back from morning 
rounds. If you look to be on the 
verge of exhaustion I shall offer you 
refreshment and a ride back.” 

“As a form of exercise,” she re- 
plied, “it beats the nightly epilepsy 
to music in the rec hall. All right. 



Doctor, I’ll follow, the prescribed 
treatment. But isn’t this a very com- 
plicated way of asking for a date?” 
“It is?” asked Devlin— then more 
honestly he added: “It is.” 

B ut he had good reasons for 
circumspection, Devlin thought 
as the girl left his surgery, and she 
understood them just as well as he 
did. The rec hall had held too much 
noise and not enough light for their 
few chaperoned meetings to have 
been generally noticed, but driving 
her away from the block in his car 
after passing through the security 
checkpoint which, at this early and 
safe time of the day was manned by 
overly talkative oldsters, would cause 
comment. Giving her a lift back in 
his medic’s vehicle, considering the 
fact that her dressing would make 
her look like a walking casualty, 
would not give rise to any talk. 

There was also the fact that as a 
member of a non-belted profession 
he was nominally a citizen, but 
actually, as far as the younger belt- 
wearers in the block were concerned, 
a sheep pretending to be a citizen. 
The girl had already suffered too 
much as a result of young citizens’ 
offering her unwanted protection 
and, in at least two cases, killing her 
men friends. They could not, of 
course, challenge Devlin to an affair, 
but they could make life unpleasant 
for him in many ways if he made 
them envious— or even annoyed them 
with the thought that a sheep might 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



113 




win a girl a citizen had lost. 

Devlin wanted to help the girl and 
he liked her company, but he was 
cautious by nature. 

The city park for that area was a 
tiny island of greenery surrounded 
by an enormous car park provided 
for its users. The car park was three- 
quarters fuU, Devlin noticed as he 
found a slot close to the main en- 
trance. This meant that the park 
itself was relatively uncrowded. He 
also saw, without really noticing 
them, the signs warning against the 
carrying of weapons inside the park 
and the city security men in full riot 
gear who lost interest in him as soon 
as they saw his walking-out whites. 
Beetle-like inside his air-conditioned 
armor and his features hidden by the 
reflections in his visor, the security 
sergeant waved him past the search 
point, as he had waved on the black- 
garbed figure who had preceded Dev- 
lin by a few seconds and who had 
halted inside the entrance. 

Hearing Devlin’s footsteps behind 
him the man turned suddenly and 
smiled. It was Brother Howard. 

“Good morning, Doctor,” he said 
pleasantly. “I was hoping to meet 
you again. Do you mind if we walk 
together?” 

“I’m meeting someone—” began 
Devlin. 

“1 understand,” said Howard, 
holding Devlin’s gaze until the 
Brother could have no doubt that the 
doctor was telling the truth. Then he 
looked at this watch and went on; 
“But you strike me as being a me- 



thodical individual. Doctor, who 
would be inclined to make appoint- 
ments, professional or social, exactly 
on the hour. It wants eighteen 
minutes to the hour, and if you 
could spare me those few minutes for 
a talk-” 

He kept pace with Devlin, waiting. 

The truth was, Devlin realized 
suddenly, that he did not know how 
long Patricia would take to reach the 
park— she might even have changed 
her mind about coming. He was 
tempted to be impolite to Howard. 
But the man had not been discour- 
teous to him, merely a little too 
insistent and Devlin had survived this 
far by being as polite as possible to 
everyone. 

“My pleasure,” he said. 

B ut the Brother said very little 
during the first few minutes and 
Devlin began to relax and enjoy the 
slow, silent pacing between the 
flower beds and under the trees. 

Many other parks in the city fea- 
tured artificial plants, but the trees in 
this one were real. Transparent plas- 
tic protected the first few yards of 
their trunks against vandals and 
name-carvers. The flower beds, which 
had less obtrusive, electronic protec- 
tion, were real as well, as evidenced 
by the delicate and natural scents 
leaking into the air and the number 
of bees in the area. The turf under- 
foot was fresh, green and springy— it 
had to be a hardwearing synthetic to 
remain in that condition after the 
daily pounding it had to withstand 



114 



GALAXY 




from the district’s collective feet. 

A sudden burst of firing— its ir- 
regular spacing, less than a mile 
distant, suggesting an affair between 
contestants who could not shoot 
straight— presently reminded Devlin 
once more that beyond the real trees 
and flower beds lay an unpleasantly 
real world. 

Beside him the Brother sighed and 
said, “I realize that I am rushing 
things. Doctor— coming much too 
quickly to the point. But there isn’t 
much time. I hope you will forgive 
me and make allowances.” 

Devlin made a wordless noise, a 
guarded grunt which, he hoped, 
would bind him to nothing. 

The Brother went on soberly, “I 
won’t insult your intelligence by 
asking if you are happy with things 
as they are. But just how unhappy 
are you?” 

“With things as they are?” 

Brother Howard nodded. “As de- 
tailed a list as you can manage.” 
Devlin began to laugh, then 
stopped, his amusement changing 
suddenly to irritation. He said, 
“There is a long list of things I’m 
unhappy about. Arming so-called re- 
sponsible citizens before they have 
reached maturity, much less achieved 
a sense of responsibility, is wrong. 
And I don’t like the way the ma- 
jority of these citizens treat the 
sheep— or the way the Maxers over- 
react if someone so much as sneezes 
without using a tissue— or the way 
city security can’t seem to be able to 
keep the peace without waging total

pretty obvious that they can’t trust 
anyone who is not another security 
man. But they don’t bother to hide 
that fact.” He went on angrily. “Oh, 
I know that the citizens and Maxers 
started out with the highest possible 
motives. We were on the verge of 
anarchy and it was thought that 
sober and responsible citizens bearing 
arms would be able to curb the worst 
excesses— the wholesale muggings and 
murders and bombings. And the idea 
of maximum rather than minimum 
response to violent crime— that 
worked for a while, too. But then 
both citizens and Maxers began look- 
ing for wrongs to right and when 
they could no longer find even a 
minor wrong they—” 

Devlin broke off, took a deep 
breath and continued, “I don’t like 
the mass processing of patients and 
the complete depersonalization in 
present-day hospitals— or the in- 
creasing loneliness that overcrowding 
brings. You have only to walk 
through a crowded rec hall at night 
to know what I mean. Curative treat- 
ment for these social ills should have 
started many generations ago,” he 
said bitterly. “I realize that nothing 
can be done at this late date, but I 
don’t have to like the situation. In 
my profession one is conditioned to 
dislike illness, I suppose— and I es- 
pecially do not like the illness and 
the rot afflicting society these days. 
The sickness goes through to the core 
and from the top to the bottom. 



There is no secure place, nothing to 
hold on to, nobody in authority 
who is fully trustworthy, nowhere to 
go that is any better. I’m generaUz- 
ing, of course— there are bound to be 
some individuals or groups trying to 
improve matters, but they are the 
exceptions that prove the rule and 
they will eventually go soft and 
rotten like the rest of us. Their 
psychiatrists or friends will explain 
the folly of remaining firm while 
everyone else is going loose. They 
will be given, or elect to take, one of 
the personality change series that will 
chemically tailor their minds to fit 
happily into present-day society. 
Sheep into citizens or vice versa with 
a couple of color-coded pills!” 

Brother Howard nodded and 
opened his mouth to speak, but 
DevUn went on savagely. “And now 
you will say something ponderous 
about confession being good for the 
soul, then lead into a lecture de- 
signed to show me the error of my 
ways-” 

“Like hell I will-” began the 
Brother, then stopped to look past 
him at the girl who was hurrying 
toward them. 

D evlin had not realized that 
they had walked around to the 
main entrance again. He introduced 
Patricia to Howard, then added; “We 
were talking about-” 

“No need to explain,” she said, 
frowning. “I could hear you from the 
gate. It sounded hke the beginning of 
a hand-to-hand affair.” 



116

“Nothing like that,” Howard said 
reassuringly. “We were simply con- 
tinuing a discussion begun some time 
ago and, much as I would like to 
finish it, I realize that I am intrud- 
ing-” 

He was intruding, but a full 
minute passed and he was still stand- 
ing there, looking from Devlin to the 
girl and pleading silently for them to 
deny it. Something was bothering 
him and Devlin’s curiosity was begin- 
ning to outweigh his irritation. He 
looked enquiringly at the girl. 

“There is no need to cut short 
your discussion on my account,” she 
said. 

The Brother’s sigh was clearly 
audible. He said, “Thank you. What I 
was really asking a few minutes ago. 
Doctor, was whether you were un- 
happy enough with the situation here 
and now to want to escape from it. I 
can offer you, perhaps both of you, a 
chance at something much better—” 

“Another thing I dislike about 
present-day society,” Devlin broke in 
harshly, “is the way people can have 
their minds changed by subtle argu- 
ment or by people offering new 
methods of escape through drugs, 
hallucinations or heightened meta- 
physical experience. I do not think, 
ftrother, that you will ever convince 
us that we would be better off dead 
and in heaven.” 

Brother Howard was waving his 
hands in agitation. They were the 
same hands that had sent an armed 
citizen to a hospital, but Devlin was 
too angry to care. He did not want to 



embark on an interminable argument 
about the after-life, comparative re- 
ligion or any other metaphysical 
means of life-support. All he wanted 
was to be alone with Patricia Morley 
and talk— and hope that something 
would develop despite the pressures 
of the sick society in which they 
lived. He would dearly love to escape 
from it— but not by using the 
Brother’s method. Taking Patricia’s 
arm, he began to turn away. 

“Wait, Doctor, please,” the 
Brother said. “When we spoke last 
you accused me of wanting to con- 
vert you and I denied it. I still do. 
But I have been thinking about our 
meeting and . Well, I’ve had a chance 
to sleep on it and I’ve come to a 
decision. The reason I wanted so 
badly to speak to you again was 
because of your ripe fruit analogy. 
You said that the human race was at 
the peak of its scientific and cultural 
abilities, but that we were too rich, 
too ripe and were about ready to 
burst. You suggested what might 
happen if someone took a firm grip 
on that fruit and squeezed hard?” 

“You would be left with a nasti- 
ness,” said Devlin. 

“And the pit would shoot out,” 
added the girl. 

“Exactly,” said the Brother. 

They stood for several minutes in 
silence broken only by the sound of 
bees and some distant shooting. 
When Brother Howard finally spoke 
he sounded awkward, diffident, but 
sincere. 

He said, “I’ve already told you 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



117 




that I am not seeking converts, but 
recruits. I am recruiting colonists and 
crew for a starship.” 

X 

D evlin had expected to see a 
ten-thousand-person block 
wrapped in a security blanket maybe 
three guards deep and packed 
with computers, simulators, medics, 
instructors and all kinds of technical 
and nontechnical support staff, as 
well as hundreds of other candidates 
under training. Instead he saw a 
small, three-story building with 
boarded-up windows and pitted walls 
symptomatic of a structure that had 
suffered a near miss. There were a lot 
of city security men nearby, but they 
were grouped around a dozen or 
more armored vehicles parked in the 
space where an adjoining building 
had been. 

The security guard at the entrance 
paid little attention to Brother 
Howard, Devlin or the girl, but this 
was because his eyes were on the 
telltales of one of the most sophis- 
ticated weapon sniffers that Devlin 
had ever seen. And when the Brother 
ushered them into a ground-floor 
office— the building did not have an 
elevator and the room’s sole occu- 
pant was obviously incapable of 
climbing stairs— the old man sitting 
behind the impressive desk computer 
showed only the most casual interest. 

There was too much skin and not 
enough underlying tissue on his 



shrunken skull for any facial expres- 
sion to show, Devlin thought. A face 
like that belonged in a terminal 
geriatrics ward, but the depth and 
power of the voice were surprising. 

“My name is Martin,” he said. “Sit 
down, please, and relax while 
Brother Howard wires you up. Don’t 
talk until he is finished and don’t ask 
questions until I have finished asking 
mine. That way you will probably 
find that you need not have asked 
them in the first place.” 

Silently and with the gentle but 
impersonal touch of an experienced 
medic. Brother Howard fitted Devlin 
and Patricia with psych collars and 
positioned the leads and sensors as 
accurately as if their skulls had been 
shaved and marked. Devlin knew that 
he should object because the collars 
were diagnostic tools that could be 
dangerous in the hands of someone 
who was not a high-level psychiatrist, 
and he had no idea of the incredibly 
old man’s professional qualifications, 
if any. But he was too intrigued— or 
perhaps too much of a moral 
coward— to argue. 

He cleared his throat and said, 
“You’re full of surprises. Brother.” 

Brother Howard smiled, gave both 
collars a final check and sat close 
enough to Martin for Devlin to be 
able to look at both men without 
moving. 

He swallowed nervously and said, 
“I’m not sure that I believe every- 
thing I’ve been told. But if I did 
believe it... Well, I’m no superman.” 

The old man nodded and said, 



118

“For this particular exercise I am 
completely disinterested in supermen 
or superwomen. Instead I am seeking 
standards that may be too high or 
too low for you to reach, because 
whether you pass them or fail to 
reach them, you fail. And now that 
my words have made you sufficiently 
worried and confused for your men- 
tal reactions to be as revealing as 
possible to this oversophisticated 
bundle of scrap—” 

“Excuse me,” said Devlin, “but 
isn’t it wrong to reveal so much 
about the purpose and mechanics of 
a test to the subject?” 

“Maybe,” said the old man. “I’m a 
stupid psychologist.” 

“But I wouldn’t bet on it,” said 
the Brother dryly. 

“Very well,” Martin went on. “We 
know that you are not a superman. 
What else are you not? Have you ever 
been a citizen? And don’t shake your 
head or you’ll loosen a sensor. Use 
your tongue.” 

“Sorry. No.” 

“Was the reason cowardice, irre- 
sponsibility or a sense of vocation?” 

D evlin to.ok a deep breath and 
tried to control his irritation, 
even though he knew that the sensors 
were picking it up and telling the old 
man all about it. He said, “In order— 
probably yes— definitely no— and I 
was ordered to take up my profes- 
sion.” 

“Go on.” 

“I was afraid of wearing the belt 
of a responsible citizen,” Devlin re- 



plied. “I think that too many citizens 
are strutting braggarts and com- 
pletely irresponsible. I became a doc- 
tor because, in my father’s opinion, I 
was unsuited for any other job.” 

The old man nodded, but there 
were too many lines on his face for 
his expression to be readable. He 
said, “Your father isn’t being 
assessed. Doctor, but his opinion of 
you might have some relevance.” 

“It has a lot of relevance,” said 
Devlin, “because I did as I was. told. 
According to my father, however, I 
was too impressionable, too soft, too 
prone to fall over my own feet to 
have any real coordination between 
eye and muscle. He did say that I 
showed intelligence at times. He 
thought that I might be stampeded 
into wearing a belt by some real or 
fancied insult. But if I did, then my 
first opponent would almost cer- 
tainly win because, even if I didn’t 
refuse to shoot because it might hurt 
him, I might not be able to draw my 
weapon without dropping it or 
shooting myself in the thigh with it. 
He was also fond of saying that 
society was going to hell and that 
nothing was sure or permanent but 
death and taxes. There was nothing I 
could do about the taxes, he told me, 
but the more widespread became the 
armed protests and honor killings, 
the greater would be the need for 
doctors.” 

“Was he a citizen?” 

“No.” 

“I see,” said Martin. “But we’ll 
leave your father for now. Have you 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



119 




ever been a Maxer? Ever been in a 
sheep fight with illegal weapons or 
hands? No? Well, how about a heated 
argument? You’re beginning to 
sound like a supersheep, Doctor, and 
that also is an abnormal condition 
that could—” 

“Try not to feel angry and in- 
sulted, Doctor,” Brother Howard 
broke in, his eyes moving over the 
desk displays. “My colleague is very 
short of time, which often means 
that he is also short of tact and good 
manners. Forgive him— and re- 
member that the qualities and char- 
acteristics for which we are testing 
are not those you yourself might 
consider important or admirable. The 
meek are going to inherit the Earth, 
Doctor. Not this Earth— but they mil 
inherit.” 

“I shall try to remember that,” 
said Devlin skeptically. Then, to the 
old man; “Yes, I have had arguments 
with other sheep, too many for me 
to remember with accuracy, but no 
fights. I take my turn on block 
security duties, but have never had to 
shoot anyone. I believe that the best 
form of defense is defense. I was 
never a Maxer for the same reason.” 

“I see,” said the resonant voice 
coming from Martin’s pendulous, 
bloodhound’s face. “Have you ever 
been friendly with or related to 
anyone who subscribed to the philos- 
ophy of maximum response?” 

“We’re back to my father again.” 
said Devlin. 

“How long was he a practicing 
Maxer?” 



“Seven, maybe eight minutes. Just 
after they had cut my mother for 
saying that they were of bunch of—” 
“So he was provoked. Casualties?” 
“Three dead, two requiring hos- 
pitalization and one with psychic 
damage that caused him to resign his 
citizen status.” 

“So he killed three, injured two 
and scared the sixth one into be- 
coming a sheep,” said the psychia- 
trist. “What age were you when he 
told you about it and how often did 
he describe the incident?” 

“I was ten,” said Devlin. “I found 
out about the incident much later. 
He didn’t speak of it at all— except 
once, maybe, when he told me that 
the most dangerous thing in the 
world was a coward driven to des- 
peration.” 

“You felt proud of him?” 

“Yes. No. I’m not sure.” 

T urning to the glrl, Martin said, 
“My apologies for taking on the 
Doctor before you. Miss Morley. It is 
Just that I was expecting to interro- 
gate your friend and you were not 
expected—” 

“What about my mother?” asked 
Devlin. “Isn’t her influence impor- 
tant?” 

“It is,” said Brother Howard, “but 
since she died sixteen years ago as a 
result of the Maxer incident just 
described, when you were only ten, 
her influence isn’t recent. Besides, 
her death meant that full psycho- 
medical records became available to 
us, so that her effect on you could be 



120 



GALAXY 




estimated with a fair degree of accu- 
racy. Your father, on the other hand, 
did not break any laws, never caught 
any serious diseases, managed to 
avoid major injuries and is still alive 
somewhere.” 

“But this means that you expected 
me here!” Devlin burst out. “If you 
had already studied my—” 

“Thoroughly,” said the Brother, 
nodding toward the psychologist. 
“Miss Morley’s being with you was a 
bonus. We have called up her records 
and she, too, is colonist material. But 
please be quiet. Doctor. My colleague 
is busy.” 

Devlin nodded carefully so as not 
to dislodge the sensors, his mind 
suddenly at least as busy as that of 
the psychologist’s— so much so that 
he missed Patricia’s initial answers. 
For if the material in Central Rec- 
ords had been made available to 
these people, then they had the 
support of Population Provisioning 
and Control, which in turn had a 
great deal of influence with Security 
and Health. In all probabiUty then, 
the squadron of security armor out- 
side was not simply on standby in 
case a disturbance might break out in 
the area— it was there to protect this 
building. 

It made the Brother’s starship 
story much easier to believe. 

He wondered about Howard’s ref- 
erence to Martin as his colleague. Was 
the Brother really a Brother? By the 
time Devlin had decided . that he 
was— his conversation and reaction 
after the Bennet boy’s death had 



been too good to be false— Martin 
had finished with the girl. 

“Bearing in mind that we are not 
looking for superhuman physical or 
mental abilities,” he said, his eyes 
moving slowly from the girl to Devlin 
and back, “I consider both of you 
suitable for further indoctrination— 
as crew members rather than colo- 
nists. The major factors we have 
considered in reaching this decision 
are that both of you are intensely 
dissatisfied with your present life 
styles and would like to escape 
them— and neither of your person- 
alities is basically violent. More 
simply, you would like to change 
things but are unwilling to hurt 
people to do it. 

“The decision regarding your crew 
status was a close one,” he went on, 
his voice seeming to vibrate inside 
their very bones, “because you. Miss 
Morley, gave indications of future 
instability should you be unable to 
find a permanent male dependent. 
You, Doctor, although Brother 
Howard had already decided on your 
suitability as a colonist, are a drifter 
dissatisfied with everything— in- 
cluding yourself. You know that 
some kind of change is necessary, but 
you are too lacking in self-confidence 
to make any decision that involves 
only yourself. If you two had not 
been complementary personalities 
and potential mates the crew rating 
decision could well have gone against 
you. My congratulations.” 

Devlin could feel the girl’s eyes on 
him. He opened his mouth to speak. 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



121 




but the psychologist went on, “We 
cannot fit you into a training sched- 
ule for another two weeks, however, 
so Brother Howard will spend as 
much of the intervening time as 
possible with you, answering your 
questions and outlining project phil- 
osophy. To begin with, this will be 
done in your own living block. You 
can arrange a cover among your- 
selves— Miss Morley requires spiritual 
as well as medical comfort, perhaps, 
and needs frequent visits of a rever- 
end during rec periods. You have 
quiet-talkers— hush-mikes— I would 

presume?” 

“Yes, but—” began Devlin. 

“I’ll try not to intrude,” said 
Brother Howard. 

“—we scarcely know each other,” 
Devlin ended. 

There was a moment’s silence. 
Then Martin said firmly, “You are 
introducing an unnecessary complica- 
tion, Doctor. I can solve it— in fact, I 
already have— but it might be better 
for both of you if I let Brother 
Howard explain it. Unlike me, he still 
has a little romance left in his soul.” 

B ut the answer was delayed. 

When they left Martin’s office 
Brother Howard signaled for silence 
and motioned them against the corri- 
dor walk Eight white coffinlike con- 
tainers, wheeled for easy movement, 
were being pushed toward the rear of 
the building where Devlin could see a 
large riot ambulance backed against a 
loading ramp. The men pushing the 
containers, which were beaded with 



moisture and radiating intense cold, 
were silent. 

“So that’s what you do with the 
unsuccessful candidates,” said the 
girl, shivering. 

“They are the successful ones. 
Miss Morley,” said Howard, “in sus- 
pended animation for holding in or- 
bit. In that condition they are not a 
drain on the ship’s consumables. It 
also means that we can train them in 
small numbers over a considerable 
period and store them until we have 
a full complement— and there is less 
risk of a security leak...” 

He talked about the training pro- 
gram and nothing else during the 
drive back to Devlin’s block. Perhaps, 
Devlin thought, Martin had handed 
the Brother a chore highly embar- 
rassing for a man of God who be- 
lieved in free will instead of en- 
docrinology. Or maybe the Brother’s 
enthusiasm for the project was as 
honest as it sounded. But he had to 
break off talking as a small explosion 
rocked the car and the armored 
shutters dropped into place. 

The period of temporary sanity 
had come to an end. 

Devlin reduced speed and drove on 
his periscope for a few hundred yards 
until a larger and softer explosion 
showered the car with debris and 
jerked it to a halt. Through the dust 
that had settled on his outer lenses 
Devlin could see that the front of a 
building had fallen into the street 
and that traffic was blocked in both 
directions. From somewhere farther 
ahead came the sudden w/zwmp-crash 



122

of a rocket opening up a vehicle, 
accompanied by sounds of shouting 
and screaming, but his armor muffled 
the noise so that he could not tell 
whether the people were protesting 
or in pain. He cut the engine, sat 
back and loosened his safety harness. 

“We could be here for some time,” 
he said. “There are sandwiches on 
the shelf beside the instrument cabi- 
net.” 

“A lot of them,” said the Brother 
appreciatively. “But of course. Doc- 
tor— you were planning a picnic in 
the park, off an imitation log table 
under a real tree. Very romantic.” 

“And practical,” said Devlin, 
“considering the mob around the 
park food dispensers. Which reminds 
me— you were supposed to give us a 
romantic answer to a practical ques- 
tion back there.” 

H oward smiled and said, “I was 
hoping that you would not in- 
sist on an answer— that you would let 
things happen naturally. Two people 
whose psych profiles are as comple- 
mentary as yours would have to 
spend only a short time in each 
other’s company to become in- 
separable. But informing most people 
of this fact tends to make them think 
that their free will is being taken 
away, that they have no choice in the 
matter. They then tend to react in an 
abnormal fashion toward each other 
out of sheer contrariness. To prove 
that they still have a choice they 
sometimes insist on making the 
wrong choice.” 



A smooth talker, this Brother, 
Devlin thought. But the truth was 
that he had already made his choice. 
Had Patricia made hers? 

“Pairing is forbidden until after 
the landing in any case.” Brother 
Howard went on, “so you will have 
plenty of time to consider. We could 
adjust your personalities so that you 
would become a latter-day Romeo 
and Juliet. But personality engineer- 
ing is one of the things you will be 
escaping from—” 

He broke off as a long burst of 
gunfire made speech impossible. Dur- 
ing a short lull that followed he tried 
again, then gave up. Devlin looked 
from the Brother to the girl, while 
she gazed steadily at him. Then the 
firing rose to a crescendo, became 
interspersed with the small, soft ex- 
plosions of gas grenades, the sounds 
of screaming, jeering and the tinkle 
and hiss of thrown firebombs. The 
girl reached forward and’ gripped his 
hand. 

It was not a panic reaction. Her 
hand was cool and steady, her grip 
just tight enough to let him know 
that she did not want to let go. The 
car’s filters, which were never one 
hundred per cent effective, were 
leaking a sharp and not unpleasant 
smell composed of smoke and barbe- 
cue odor. Quite suddenly the world 
became quiet— except for the scream- 
ing. 

In the distance presently arose the 
sound of sirens and the intermittent 
whining of the heavy Sanator ambu- 
lances as they used their jet-lift to 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM

jump intervening traffic. Brother 
Howard reached toward the hatch 
handle. 

“No,” said Devlin harshly. “We 
can’t give medical assistance to com- 
pare with the heavies— and they’ll be 
too busy to let you give any other 
kind. Oh, they’ll give you a white 
coat if you insist, but not the body 
armor to go under it— and they’ll be 
very annoyed if a surviving protester 
makes another casualty out of you. 
Believe me, I know.” More quietly he 
went on: “But they are very well 
equipped and expert at their job. 
Brother. And good at separating the 
potential survivors from the others 
on whom hospitalization would be 
wasted. So just be patient until the 
ambulances and the law have gone- 
then there will be plenty of work for 
you to do. After all, it is the unsal- 
vageable ones who really need your 
help.” 

The Brother nodded and loosened 
his grip on the handle while the girl 
suddenly tightened hers on Devlin’s 
hand. 

“This,” she said, “is a terrible way 
to live.” 

The hours that followed were not 
pleasant to remember because they 
were spent helping the Brother to 
comfort the still-living dying. But 
later, when they were together in the 
block rec hall and talking about the 
starship via miniature hush-mikes and 
earplugs, they had soon forgotten the 
incident. 

It had been very easy to forget just 
then because the process that was 



supposed to happen naturally was 
well advanced and Devlin for one had 
no control over it. And it had been a 
happy and interesting day apart from 
the riot. 

COOI-DOWN IN FIVE MINUTES. 
Devlin shivered and thought about 
the enormous, complex ship and its 
interminable voyage, about the colo- 
nists, with hours of life sandwiched 
between decades of frigid sleep and 
about his suspicions that something 
had been done— or was being done— 
to their cold-sleeping minds. His 
memories and dreams were much too 
vivid and complete, suggesting that 
they were being artificially stimu- 
lated. Were he, Patricia and the colo- 
nists where they thought they 
were— or was this simply an advanced 
simulation and final weeding-out pro- 
cess for the candidates? 

Of one thing he was sure. This, 
too, was a terrible way to live. 

XI 

The most persistent memories 
of his early life were of confine- 
ment and restriction, both in the 
clothing he had to wear and the 
limitations placed upon his move- 
ments inside and around the 
castle. As he grew older he came 
to realize that the stairs had been 
too large and steep for his child’s 
legs and undeveloped sense of 
balance, and, as he grew older still, 
he learned about the faceless 
people who might kill him if he 
strayed alone beyond the protec- 



124 



GALAXY 




tion of the outer walls. 

He never did fully understand 
why he had to be continuaUy 
smothered in satin and frills. Even 
in bed he had to wear more 
clothes than most of his people 
wore in mid-winter, including a 
cap with ear-muffs that was like a 
jeweled cloth crown. 

A laughing, leather-kilted and 
strong-smelling giant called Hawn 
told him’ that all this was because 
he was more important than 
everyone else and had to be pro- 
tected against sickness, damp and 
the attacks of enemies. Later, 
when the giant Hawn had shrunk 
to normal size, he said much the 
same things, but usually tried to 
change the subject by hitting or 
prodding him with a wooden 
sword— but never painfully. And 
when he was full grown and Hawn 
had become a wiry little man with 
graying hair who laughed but sel- 
dom, such questions were left for 
his advisors to answer and the 
swords used to change the subject 
were no longer of wood. 

But age, or perhaps an un- 
willing pupil, had made Hawn 
shrewish of late. 

“Slashing and cutting is a waste 
of effort, armed as you are. Sire. 
To slash with a light sword you 
must move your shield clear of 
your body, leaving it unprotected. 
Move it aside only enough to aim 
and stab and never block a blow 
directly— a strong thrust from 
your enemy will go through your 

THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



shield unless it is very thick and 
heavy, and in that case it will tire 
you and slow you down. A light 
shield used to deflect, not block, 
an attack and with a sharp edge 
which enables it to serve as an 
additional weapon is best. Sire- 
provided you do not become 
angry and begin waving your 
sword around your head as most 
of the others will be doing.” 

“Yes,” he , said, whirling the 
sword around his head and cutting 
another notch in the wood of the 
practice stump. 

“Carving pieces off your enemy 
may give you pleasure. Sire,” said 
Hawn with irritating patience, 
“but an aimed thrust in the vitals 
is instantly disabling and fatal. 
There is no need to skewer your 
enemy— a finger’s length in any 
vital area, followed by a twist 
before withdrawal, will do it. You 
should practice at every oppor- 
tunity, Sire, until it becomes 
habit.” 

“Very well, Hawn,” he said 
coldly. “I shall keep a cool head 
and kill an enemy with every 
blow, but I, think you are a 
calculating and cruel man.” 

“No, Sire,” said his master-at- 
arms. “A wounded enemy is a 
dangerous enemy. If he is also a 
thoughtful enemy he will know 
that his wound, even though it 
may not be disabling, will go bad 
and kill him slowly with fever and 
vomiting and endless thirst. You 
have not yet seen a battle. Sire, or 

125 




its long aftermath when the 
wounded are brought home to 
their friends who try to bind and 
poultice them and try to make 
them live, to no avail.” 

“Enough!” he said angrily. “I 
shall try, then, to be cool and 
kind in battle. Now guard your- 
self.” 

For several minutes he cut and 
thrust at his master-at-arms while 
the old man parried or ducked 
every single blow. Then gradually 
the cool, calculated methods of 
attack which Hawn had tried to 
instill came back to him and he 
saw his aged opponent becoming 
more and more worried. But by 
then his anger had faded and he 
was no longer trying to kill the 
irritating old man. 

When he told his mother about 
the incident that evening and of 
how Hawn had complimented him 
on the excellence of his attack, 
she was far from pleased. For the 
first time she told him how his 
father had died— not as it was 
recorded in the library, of wounds 
received in a glorious and heroic 
battle, but from a mere scratch in 
his arm made by the dirty stave of 
a dying foot soldier. The scratch 
had gone bad and, after many 
weeks, so had the arm. It was 
stinking and corrupt, and dead 
before his father was. 

Unlike his mother and Hawn, 
his advisers were old and wise and 
never irritating. They gave quiet 



and thoughtful approval to his 
idea— or had it, perhaps, been 
their idea?— that a man should not 
run like a child to his mother for 
advice and that he should think of 
fathering an heir to his kingdom. 
He overheard a highly insulting 
remark, which he was probably 
meant to overhear, about his 
peace-loving grandfather’s having 
been a great and glorious queen— 
and everyone had laughed just an 
instant after he did. 

But later they became serious 
and talked about the noble ladies 
he might choose to marry and the 
political and territorial advantages 
each possible candidate would 
bring him. The discussions were 
all cold and calculating and much 
hke one of Hawn’s lessons. But he 
did not mind because they also 
spoke, for the first time, of the 
desirability of bringing royal con- 
cubines into residence while a 
suitable queen was found for him. 

Except for Hawn’s irritating 
bullying and the equally irritating 
acquiescence of his advisers, he 
was happy during the eight years 
that followed. His domain was 
free of disaffection, plague, and 
war. 

The war started because of a 
chance remark by a traveler to 
one of his advisers, a remark he 
was not supposed to overhear. 
The advisers had boasted that 
from the highest tower in the 
palace their king could not see to 



126 



GALAXY 




the borders of his lands, and the 
visitor had replied that this was so 
only when rain was falling to the 
eastward. 

Even on the clearest days the 
hill, which was just inside the 
border of the adjoining kingdom, 
was only a tiny swelling on the 
eastern horizon, misty with dis- 
tance and visible only from the 
highest tower. It was densely 
wooded and uninhabitated and 
unlikely to be considered of value 
by the monarch to whom it be- 
longed, but this had not been the 
first visitor to joke about it. Of 
itself the thing was unimportant, a 
tiny pimple on the face of his fair 
land— but even a small pimple 
could itch. 

When he mentioned it in coun- 
cil, Hawn laughed uproariously, 
then said, “The simple solution. 
Sire, would be to plant a grove of 
trees between the palace and the 
offending object—” 

Hawn broke off, sUenced by 
the look on his face. Realizing 
that their king was not jesting and 
that he knew exactly what he 
wanted, the council members be- 
gan deliberating on the best way 
of getting the hill for him. 

Very tactfuUy it was suggested 
to him that he could not simply 
take the small and worthless piece 
of his neighbor’s territory without 
very good reasons for doing so— 
reasons that would add to rather 
than diminish the respect in which 
he was held. The constant re- 

THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



minders about the presence of the 
hill were embarrassing, of course, 
but his advisors suggested that 
perhaps at the back of his mind he 
might also have realized that it 
overlooked a large area of his 
kingdom and, should his neighbor 
intend taking up arms against 
him— and there was no evidence to 
the contrary— the hill would con- 
fer a mihtary advantage. In fact, it 
was suddenly considered impera- 
tive that a small, well-armed but 
secret force should be deployed 
on the border as close to the hill 
as possible, to guard against the 
possibility of an observation 
post’s being set up there. Prepara- 
tions would probably take half a 
year, but this would allow time to 
recruit and train men and for the 
people to come to feel sufficiently 
threatened to support a war. 

They saw his baffled expression 
and once again it was Hawn who 
spoke. He said, “The men will be 
equipped with plain shields and 
armor and will carry no identify- 
ing standards. We will see that 
they are undersuppUed and that 
they will find it necessary to Hve 
off the land. This means that 
much Uvestock in the area will 
disappear, usually at night, and it 
will be easier to rob our own 
people than the others across the 
border— although they, too, will 
find sheep and chickens missing 
from time to time. Soon the other 
king will send some of his soldiers 
to investigate these occurrences, 

127 




but before that there will be 
complaints and much anger from 
our own people who have 
suffered. Cause and effect will 
become confused in their minds, 
which are not very bright, Sire, 
and they wiU appeal to you for 
protection. The appeal will have 
general support and when the 
other king’s men clash with 
ours—” 

“These nocturnal raids—” he 
said sharply. “WUl any of my 
people be hurt?” 

“No, Sire,” said Hawn. “Unless 
they think more of their chickens 
than they do of their miserable 
hves.” 

During the months that follow- 
ed he had second thoughts about 
the war he had engineered and 
which was rapidly becoming in- 
evitable. When the first news of 
the growing trouble on his border 
reached the capital he tried to give 
orders that would recall his sol- 
diers and allow the situation to 
cool down— but the effort 
dwindled to a small inner voice 
that never won the cooperation of 
his Ups and tongue. When word 
reached him that his anonymous 
men were taking more than chick- 
ens and sheep— that they were 
taking wives and daughters as weU 
and killing anyone who ob- 
jected— he grew angry Avith him- 
self. He also grew publicly angry 
and rode among his people, who 
more and more often hailed him 
as their protector. Sometimes 



their cheering managed to drown 
the quiet, nagging voice of his 
conscience— of both his con- 
sciences. 

He was dimly aware of a 
strange mental ghost called Devlin 
that gibbered unheeded when his 
real thoughts and decisions were 
leading him into danger. It kept 
reminding him that the brachia- 
pod, too, had represented a 
deadly danger and his trilobite 
had crawled within reach of its 
tentacles. Then there had been the 
incident with the young allo- 
saurus, the insane jealousy of the 
tree-dwelling presimians, the time 
he had been wounded by a big cat 
and had plastered the bloody tear 
with filthy, matted grass instead 
of washing it in the sea and 
allowing the sun’s UV to heal the 
wound. But the ghost’s warnings 
were like a viewer’s efforts to 
influence the actors on a tele- 
vision screen— whatever that was. 

The Devlin ghost was inside 
him, thinking strange out-of-con- 
text thoughts and giving unheard 
advice, but it was not really a part 
of the spoiled, forty-year-old boy 
who rode at the head of his small 
army against a self-manufactured 
threat. 

Eastward his domain extended 
to the river that passed within a 
mile of the lower slopes of the 
offending hill. The river was only 
a few feet deep, but the banks 
were Uned with prickly bushes. 
One of them must have scratched 



128 



GALAXY 




the belly of Hawn’s horse as it was 
climbing the bank, because the 
animal reared sudenly, throwing 
its rider and then dragging him by 
one stirrup as it floundered and 
splashed downstream. Two of 
Hawn’s men gave chase and man- 
aged to head the horse up and on 
to the bank, but by that time the 
master-at-arms had drowned. 

Looking at the slack, wet face 
and the heavy armor Hawn had 
taken to wearing as his aging 
joints had stiffened, the king felt 
anger at the man’s ridiculous and 
ignoble death. The laughing giant 
of his childhood should not have 
ended his life like this, 

“Leave him until after the 
battle,” he said sternly, then more 
softly for the benefit of his sol- 
diers, “If you remember his teach- 
ing when you meet the enemy, he 
stiU lives.” 

They reformed and moved to- 
ward the base of the hill where 
the other army was already 
gathering - 

All soldiers in his service had 
been trained— taking into account 
the differences in personal armor 
and weapons— in the same way as 
their monarch. Even the pike- 
men, who did not matter very 
much to either side in a battle, 
had been instructed in Hawn’s 
methods of cool-headed and cal- 
culated attack and personal de- 
fense. The long and unhandy 
pikes— which until then had been 
little more than sharpened 

THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



branches— had been shortened and 
thickened and a cross-piece had 
been added near the base so that 
they had the handling characteris- 
tics of both a long sword and a 
short spear. In battle a pike-man 
was supposed to knock aside his 
opponent’s lighter and longer pike 
with his short heavy one or catch 
the thrust in his crosspiece and 
steer it past his body, then close 
and dispatch his enemy before the 
other could shorten his grip for a 
second blow. 

There were hundreds of bruised 
ribs among his men to prove that, 
in training at least, the method 
• was effective. 

There was no sign of cooking 
fires from the other side, so ob- 
viously their prince wanted to 
settle the affair before the midday 
meal. The prince, who was leading 
an army slightly more numerous 
than his own, had taken the field 
because his father was too old and 
heavy to mount a horse safely. 
The fact that losing this battle 
would mean his yielding to little 
more than a boy— and a very 
boastful boy, at that— had weigh- 
ed heavily in his decision to adopt 
Hawn’s new and in some ways not 
quite honorable ideas. 

In leisurely and dignified 
fashion he deployed his forces— 
pikemen to the fore, mounted 
soldiers who were the personal 
troops of two of his most trusted 
lords protecting his flanks, and 
the rest of the nobles, their men 

129 




and his own guard surrounding 
him. When his formation was 
complete the two armies would 
face each other within hailing 
distance until trumpeters on both 
sides announced their readiness to 
fight. 

After that they would advance 
toward each other and fight until 
one side or the other decided that 
an unacceptable number of casual- 
ties had been sustained and yield 
the field to the victor. A parley to 
achieve a settlement of land or 
gold would follow and then every- 
one would go home. Most of the 
fighting would be between pike- 
men and foot soldiers, but a few 
of his nobles would be able to 
exercise within the safety of their 
resplendent armor while he and 
his guard stood decoratively in the 
middle of his army until the issue 
had been decided. 

But his formation was still in- 
complete when trumpets blared 
on die other side. Their nobles, 
personal troops and the prince’s 
guard, the prince himself at their 
center, began trotting quickly 
along the rear of their own pike 
lines, pennants fluttering on their 
lances and plumes undulating like 
flying caterpillars. It was not until 
they had rounded the flank of 
their pike-men and lowered their 
lances to charge that he realized 
that Hawn had not been the only 
radical military thinker. 

The young prince was hot- 
headed and anxious to prove him- 



self fit to lead and rule, but he 
was doing a strange and dishonor- 
able thing. 

Instead of trying merely to win 
a battle the prince intended to kill 
the opposing king. 

TTie king’s pike-men had not 
been expected to withstand a 
charge led by heavily armored 
horsemen and they did not do so. 
But they did remember Hawn’s 
training and some of them 
managed to fend off the lances 
and stab at the horses, or jump 
aside at the last moment and stick 
their pikes between the forelegs, 
bringing the horse and its rider to 
the ground, where a dazed and 
heavily encumbered man was easy 
to IdU. 

The king saw the center of his 
pike line collapse, saw the op- 
posing lines of pike-men begjn to 
walk forward, saw his flankers 
galloping from each side along the 
narrowing gap between the op- 
posing lines with the obvious in- 
tention of following the enemy 
horsemen through the gap they 
had made and taking them in the 
rear. Then he, whose royal person 
was supposed to be inviolate, was 
fighting for his life like the low- 
liest pike-man. 

One of the opposing nobles 
leading the attack was charging 
down on him, lance leveled and 
visor open for better seeing. He 
tried desperately to move aside, 
but was hampered by the press of 
his guards. Suddenly there was a 



130 



GALAXY 




horseman between his attacker 
and himself— his guard captain, 
judging by the helmet crest— who 
screamed shrilly as a bloody lance 
head sprouted from the small of 
his back. The captain rolled off 
his horse, taking the enemy’s 
lance with him. But the other was 
already drawing his heavy sword 
to aim a two-handed swing. 

The king slashed in panic at the 
man’s helmet, saw the plume be- 
gin to drift groundward, then 
managed to get his shield up in 
time to block the swing. The 
shock nearly paralyzed his arm 
and he was left with a splintered 
shield dangling loosely from its 
arm straps and his enemy was 
raising his sword high above his 
head for the final killing blow. He 
remembered Hawn saying that a 
shield should be used to deflect, 
not block a heavy weapon and 
that an angry or excited enemy 
exposed himself during an attack. 

He spurred forward, took atm 
at one of the dimly seen eyes 
below the opponent’s open visor 
and thrust to fuU extension. His 
sword met with very little resis- 
tance and he thought that he had 
not been able to reach far enough, 
but he twisted it before with- 
drawing as Hawn had advised. His 
enemy’s weapon tumbled into the 
long grass and the man followed 
it, beating frantically at the sides 
of his helmet with his mailed fists. 
Then another lance was reaching 



toward him across the riderless 
horse, so that he could not get to 
close quarters with the new 
threat. He dug his spurs into his 
mount and puUed back hard on 
the reins— another Havm-taught 
trick— so that it reared and took 
the thrust meant for him. He had 
already disengaged his feet from 
the stirrups by the time the horse 
fell squealing and threshing to the 
ground, taking the broken lance 
with it. He jumped clear and ran 
around the riderless horse in time 
to see his opponent reaching for 
the sword in a back scabbard. 

The two-handed reach left a 
three-inch unarmored gap at the 
enemy’s armpits. The king paused 
an instant to take aim, make a 
thrust, twist and withdrawal. As 
the man fell he snatched the 
other’s shield and for a few 
minutes had to fight vidth one of 
his own Havm-trained guards who 
took him for an enemy. The look 
on the man’s face when he dis- 
covered whom he was fighting was 
so ludicrous that the king laughed 
out loud— a great, bellowing guf- 
faw that sounded terribly out of 
place in the middle of a battle. 

This was the stuff of which 
legends were made, for it was 
clearly evident that his enemies 
were intent on killing him as well 
as winning the battle— a most dis- 
honorable intention. He was 
matching their dishonor with his 
own cold and calculating fighting 
methods. 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



131 




As the attacks on his person 
became fewer he took to helping 
his guards, stepping forward to 
make a flanking attack when a 
man or group was hard-pressed, 
relieving his men with the deadly, 
calculated thrusts which left dead 
or rapidly dying enemies in his 
wake. He did not have to do this 
very often, but later there was 
hardly a man who did not boast 
proudly that the king, personally, 
had saved his life during the 
battle. Later the scribes elabo- 
rated on these stories and added 
details of a fight in which the king 
had slain the opposing prince in 
single combat. 

There were many suits of beau- 
tifully decorated and costly armor 
tumbled about in the long, 
trampled grass and leaking 
blood— but he had not been re- 
sponsible for all of them. Anyone, 
perhaps even an overzealous pike- 
man, could have slain the prince 
on that confused and bloody 
morning. It was a strange battle 
with only the enemy making the 
noise. Only they did the charging, 
the shouting of battle cries and 
most of the dying. If the fighting 
were not stopped soon there 
would not be enough of the 
enemy left to bury his own dead. 

“Hold— enough of this slaugh- 
ter!” he called suddenly and 
pointed with his sword toward a 
group of opposing nobles and 
their remaining personal soldiers 
who were fighting hopelessly a 



few yards away. “Enough! I call 
on you to yield with honor!” 

On his return to the palace that 
evening he was haded as the great- 
est warrior of all time and the 
festivities in celebration of his 
victory went on for three days. He 
had been called his people’s pro- 
tector and now they added The 
Merciful to his name because he 
had not killed each and every one 
of his enemies. A little later they 
added The Peacemaker because of 
the alliance he negotiated between 
his kingdom and its recent enemy. 

With the prince slain and his 
father, the old king, ailing and 
ruling with difficulty a country 
that was poor and ripe for revolt, 
the victorious king helped his erst- 
while enemy with gold and grain 
in return for an agreement that 
their kingdoms would eventually 
merge with his marriage to the 
enemy princess, an exquisitely 
beautiful child of nine, when she 
arrived at a suitable age. This 
would probably mean that he 
would have to give up his concu- 
bines for a while at least, but in 
ten years’ time he would be much 
older and that might not be such a 
great hardship. There was one 
problem, however, and that was 
that his young queen-to-be did 
not like him. 

Her father explained that she 
had dearly loved her older 
brother, the prince, who had 
taken her about on his horse and 
told her tales of great and glorious 



132 



GALAXY 




deeds of valor. In a way it had 
been like the early relationship 
between Hawn and himself, ex- 
cept that she had been an im- 
pressionable girl-child and the 
prince had not lived long enough 
to become boastful and irritating 
to her maturing mind. But her 
father assured him that childish 
memories and feelings were short- 
lived and that when the time came 
she would be honored to wed 
such a great king. 

And he was a great and well- 
loved king to his people. Apart 
from that single morning’s battle 
there were no more wars in his 
reign. Adjoining kingdoms, 
worried by the fighting prowess of 
his small but well-trained army, 
had to be reassured. Threats of 
combined aggression had to be 
countered by various devious 
methods— none of which were 
honorable and many of which 
were utterly despicable. He had to 
be constantly on guard against the 
devious threats of groups within 
his own court. But his kingdom 
prospered and his reputation for 
honesty and mercy and nobility 
grew, it seemed, in direct propor- 
tion to the depths of dishonor to 
which he sank. 

As the years went by the costly 
robes he used to find so irksome 
gave girth and stature to his wast- 
ing body and when the time came 
for his wedding he had begun to 
feel uncertain in ways he would 

THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



never have believed possible. 

He was beginning to feel old. 

But he was not yet old enough 
to be unaffected by the glory and 
pageantry of the wedding or by 
the obeisance of the nobles of two 
powerful kingdoms which were 
now one. And he would have had 
to be senile indeed not to be 
affected by the sight of his young 
queen. She had been a beautiful 
child and he had discounted as 
diplomatic exaggeration the 
stories of her increasing beauty as 
she approached womanhood. But 
when he saw her on the eve of 
their wedding he knew that the 
couriers had been stupid, tongue- 
tied, insensitive and blind crea- 
tures whose rhapsodies had not 
done her justice. 

During the three years follow- 
ing the wedding she was the most 
loved person in the kingdom— the 
king was respected and feared as 
well as being loved. She was in- 
credibly lovely, regal, gracious and 
faithful— and as cold toward him 
in the privacy of their chambers as 
the ice that covered the northern 
wastes. During those three years 
she gave him two strong and 
healthy sons and a great deal of 
irritation. 

He could not express his anger 
in public, or even admit to its 
existence within the palace, be- 
cause his queen was too much 
loved for him to make her appear 
anything but perfect. The trouble 
was that she behaved perfectly 

133 




toward everyone but him— her dis- 
position was pleasant toward the 
servants and guards— she laughed a 
lot and her gaiety was unforced 
and to nobles and serfs alike she 
showed consideration. But the 
king she did not love and she did 
not want to be his confidant or 
companion either. 

Several times he tried to ex- 
plain about the bloody confusion 
of the battle in which her brother 
had died, but on each occasion it 
was obvious that the impression 
left by the scribes who had re- 
corded the event, and who had 
not even been there, was much 
deeper and longer lasting than the 
words of her king. 

Sheer loneliness and the need 
for companionship if not under- 
standing made him consider re- 
calling one of his concubines, but 
that would have made him look 
ridiculous— not because the prac- 
tice was frowned on, but because 
no woman in the kingdom was 
more beautiful and desirable than 
his own queen. So he returned to 
the lonely Ufe of being a feared 
and respected and powerful mon- 
arch and took pleasure in only 
three things. 

Two of them were his sons, 
who were growing taller and 
stronger and more handsome with 
each passing day. His third plea- 
sure came from playing the de- 
vious, dangerous and dishonorable 
game that would, if he won, en- 
sure the continued existence and 



future long life of the first two 
pleasures. For the life of a king, 
even one who was loved and 
generally referred to as Great, was 
an uncertain thing. 

He could not know for certain 
who had been responsible, but for 
the few seconds in which he was 
able to think he thought sadly 
that this act would cause grave 
instability in the kingdom and 
that his queen must have loved 
her big brother very much. Then 
the knife that had been driven 
upward into his back at waist level 
was given an expert twist as it was 
withdrawn and, briefly, he suffer- 
ed more pain than he would have 
believed possible.

“Mary,” said Devlin furiously, 
“had a little lamb.” He began the 
careful movements of his back, arms 
and legs which would allow him to 
get out of the casket. The process of 
remembering was involuntary and 
the memories were painfully sharp. 

Devlin gritted his teeth and 
moaned at the remembered pain of 
that knife thrust, at the burning 
agony that was like a fire inside his 
cold and shocked body. He tried to 
push away the memory, to escape 
the king’s life as well as his death and 
return to his own life. Instead he 
found himself watching that same 
king in action from a distance of a 
few dozen yards, and holding the 
broken pike that had transfixed him. 
He was moaning and holding it as 
steady as his fading strength would 
allow because if it moved the pain 
became even worse. 

He fought off that dream, too, and 
suddenly he was babbling at the 
streaming roof of his cave while a 
fever raged through his hairy body— 
then he was a dying mountain of 
flesh and bone somewhere in the 
Jurassic period and a near-mindless 
crawler on a warm seabed, eating and 
being eaten... 

“Stop it!” he shouted. “You’re

“I can do that,” said Devlin sav- 
agely, “without even trying.” 

He had been repeatedly told dur- 
ing training that the ability to re- 
member was vital and that it must 
not be allowed to weaken, lest the 
human seedlings in their star-travel- 
ing metal pod drift forever as cold- 
sleeping and mindless vegetables. But 
that, apparently was not to be the 
danger. His memory of past real and 
dream incidents kept returning with 
a clarity and intensity that terrified 
him. 

While he had been thinking back 
to that training session, he had been 
in the room, hearing every word the 
instructor had said, aware of the 
sounds of attention and inattention 
of the people around him, feeling the 
abrasive pressure of bristles against 
the backs of his fingers as he rested 
his chin on his closed fist. 

This, he thought fearfully, is what 
total recall is like. 

E verywhere Ms mind’s eye 
looked it was dazzled by the 
bright intensity of the images and the 
sharpness of sensory recollections. 
Their impact seemed to be worse

when he closed his eyes, so he kept 
them open and tried desperately— 
and vainly— not to use his mind at all. 

But then his hand rested briefly on 
the edge of the service panel and it 
was as if two full-sensor films were 
being superimposed. There was the 
sight and feel of the panel’s edge, the 
open casket and the display that was 
still reminding him to exercise and 
remember. But there was also, 
equally sharp, the picture of one of 
the lecture rooms and an instructor 
saying, “...the duration of the voyage 
win be measured in centuries, but the 
biological time that will elapse— that 
is, the time during which you will be 
conscious and with your metabolism 
functioning normally— will be mea- 
sured in days. And not very many of 
those. That is why the food and air 
must be strictly rationed— the water 
is recycled and no problem. You 
must not eat unless advised to do so 
by your cubicle display-, no matter 
how long in real time it has been 
between meals. Food synthesizers, 
seed stores, domesticated animals in 
cold sleep will remain sealed in their 
special module, which can be opened 
only on landing. 

“So it will be the duration of 
waking time that dictates your food 
intake,” the instructor went on, “and 
you should not increase your hunger 
by staying awake longer than the 
allotted time, even though there is 
provision for delaying cooldown in 
an emergency. For the same reason 
you must avoid using the resuscita- 
tion overrides to warm one or more 



of the others before their allotted 
time...” 

He smiled, showing teeth pointed 
in a style that had been fashionable 
three years earlier. Devlin re- 
membered the digestive upsets and 
lacerated tongues that particularly 
stupid fad had caused in its time and 
then the instructor was talking again. 

“It is not our intention that you 
arrive on your new planet suffering 
from malnutrition, but you must 
exercise restraint in the matter of—” 

One of the group, a colonist whose 
name was Clarke, broke in with a 
question. He asked, “Suppose we are 
lonely rather than hungry. Suppose 
we feel the need, after all those 
centuries of time, of a little female 
company— or male company, as the 
case might be. Are we forbidden 
to-” 

“You are advised most strongly 
against it,” said the instructor. “By 
now you should be aware that your 
period of deprivation, counted in 
biological time, will be a matter of 
days or at most weeks. Try to pay 
attention. This matter will be ex- 
plained in greater detail during the 
project philosophy lectures, but two 
reasons can be mentioned now. 

“The first is that such premature 
couplings will involve a heavy expen- 
diture of energy, which in turn will 
demand an increased intake of food. 
The second— and much more impor- 
tant-reason is that while we have 
proved to our complete satisfaction 
that repeated coolings and resuscita- 
tions in no way impair the male and 



136 



GALAXY 




female reproductive systems, we are 
still unsure of the results on such a 
delicately balanced organism as a 
recently conceived foetus. For this 
reason conception must not take 
place during the voyage...” 

I NEVITABLY the recollection 
opened up a Hne of thought that 
fiUed the cubicle with bright, re- 
membered pictures of gargantuan 
grapplings and couplings from his 
dream past, many of which he 
seemed to be recalling for the first 
time and found too incredibly savage 
to be pleasant. But occasionally there 
were incidents— snatches of the king’s 
lovelife when he was young, a 
memory of a small, dark, incredibly 
passionate girl from he knew not 
where— which were very pleasant 
indeed. But he could not hold on to 
the pleasant dream incidents because 
the raw, violent episodes were pulled 
in again by strong chains of associa- 
tion and engulfed them. 

H e sat for a moment on the 
edge of the casket, his eyes 
squeezed shut and his limbs tremb- 
ling despite the exercises and the 
cubicle heaters. But closing his eyes 
blotted out only the cubicle around 
him, not the supersharp pictures that 
Ids mind kept throwing on the dark 
red screen of his closed eyelids. 

What have they done to my mind? 
“...During the voyage you will be 
thrown on to your own mental re- 
sources,” Martin, the incredibly aged 
psychologist was saying. “You must 



use your minds because what you 
don’t use you lose. We cannot use 
them for you in spite of the wide 
range of psycho-medication presently 
available to us. 

“While it is possible to include 
mechanisms capable of administering 
medication of this type during the 
voyage,” he continued, “it is impera- 
tive that the cubicle systems be kept 
as simple as possible to reduce the 
possibility of long-term component 
failure. Adding dispensing equipment 
of this kind would place a serious 
strain on the overall system. In any 
case, the temperature and radiation 
changes used during the hibernation 
and resuscitation processes could, 
over a long period, cause chemical 
changes in the medication with un- 
foreseen and perhaps fatal results. 

“You must also remember that 
you have been chosen because you 
are normal people,” he went on, 
playing the beautifully modulated 
instrument that was his voice in such 
a fashion that what should have been 
an insult came across as a sincere 
compUment. “We have sought long 
and diligently for people who are 
normally motivated, normally nasty, 
normally accident-prone and even 
normally stupid. It is not— and never 
has been— our intention to make 
supermen or superwomen out of 
you. Geniuses, supernormal people, 
are like rare chemical elements— they 
tend toward instab Uity. We cannot 
afford to be too sophisticated, to 
finesse too much. There is too much 
danger of component failure for us 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



137 




to risk people failure as well. So you 
are as stable as we could make you. 

“you are like lead— or no, that is a 
trifle too stable. Think of yourselves 
as mud, but mud in which something 
will grow...” 

With the remembered words came 
the memory of the almost impercep- 
tible sighings, rustlings and creakings 
of the other colonists-to-be trying to 
remain silent and the sharp, fearful 
excitement of what they were going 
to do. But something had now gone 
terribly wrong. 

D evlin opened his eyes and 
looked intently at his immediate 
surroundings, trying to fix his mind 
as well as his vision on the here and 
now. 

If he could believe that wrinkled 
husk of a psychologist or any of his 
instructors— or even Brother 
Howard— his mind was his own. Dur- 
ing'the early stages of instruction he 
had been questioned under hypnosis, 
but this had been admitted by the 
medics concerned and had been 
simply a means of speeding up the 
acquisition of his personality data. 
There had also been a number of 
physical tests carried out under anes- 
thetic— but those, he had been 
assured, had been aimed solely at 
estabhshing genetic and general 
health factors. A wide variety of 
medication and direct electrical stim- 
ulation were available— these could 
heighten sensation, improve memory 
and even insert memories which had 
not previously been there— but these 



procedures, he had been told, had 
not been used on the ship’s per- 
sonnel. 

If he believed that, what explana- 
tion was there for the diamond-sharp 
dreams about subjects and events and 
people of which he knew that he had 
no previous experience? The trilobite 
sequence, the brontosaurus, even the 
incredible details of his dream of 
being a great king— his mind had 
contained no such source material 
before he joined the ship. So it must 
have been implanted afterward, per- 
haps was being implanted every time 
he underwent a cooldown. 

Suppose the things they had told 
him were generally true, but just to 
be on the safe side they had decided 
to ignore the simple approach in his 
case. Perhaps someone had second 
thoughts and the result had been 
that, instead of fading and needing 
constant exercise and renewal, Dev- 
lin’s mind and memory were growing 
sharper and more retentive with 
every cooldown. It had grown so 
sharp that he was, he realized, utterly 
terrified of going into cold sleep 
again. 

Abruptly he wanted out of that 
cubicle and away from the process 
that was driving him mad. If there 
had been post-hypnotic commands 
against leaving the cubicle when not 
ordered to do so, they had faded 
over the centuries because he was 
able to use the manual override on 
the seal without any hesitation what- 
ever. Then he was in the corridor, his 
breath hanging like misty balloons 



138 



GALAXY 




around his head. He was trying to 
think. 

If he was, as he suspected, a 
special case, then the circuitry that 
had been feeding his mind with 
dreams and the mechanism for ad- 
ministering the supportive medica- 
tion should be capable of being 
switched off. He did not have the 
technical training to recognize one of 
the circuits or mechanisms or 
switches if he saw them but by 
careful scrutiny he should be able to 
see differences in the wiring and 
telltales coming from his cubicle and 
those of the others. If he had an 
extra strand of cable or length of 
plumbing he could always cut it— if 
he could not follow it back to a 
switch. 

Such a course would be very dan- 
gerous, stupid even. But the risk was 
acceptable because he refused to 
undergo cooldown again if there 
were the slightest chance that those 
incredibly realistic dreams would re- 
turn. 

For a few seconds he cringed as 
the remembered knife tore into his 
body and he was crushed by the 
cephalopod and a score of other 
violent deaths overtook him— then he 
fought desperately to force those 
memories away and return to reality. 
It was the cold that saved him 
finally, reminding him that he must 
go to the control center and switch 
on the heaters and put on coveralls 
before he did anything else. But he 
had gone only a few yards when he 
had to stop. 



A man’s body had been concealed 
by a cabinet that projected from the 
wall of the corridor. It was held 
between the wall-net and the metal 
plating, arms and legs outstretched 
and shining with the intense cold. 
Devhn could see that as much as 
possible of the body’s surface was in 
contact with the cold metal and that 
the man had, of course, died from 
exposure. The reason for the death, 
as opposed to the cause, was equally 
easy to see. 

The eyelids were held open by two 
pieces of adhesive tape. 

Devhn, it appeared, had not been 
the only one to be singled out for 
special treatment and this man had 
chosen to die rather than go on 
dreaming. 

XIII 

F or more than an hour Devhn 
checked and rechecked the con- 
trol center teUtales, searching for 
some clue to the identity of the dead 
man and where he had come from. 
He concentrated on the search be- 
cause he badly needed something 
safe to think about— even though he 
knew that when the search was 
ended he would have to face the 
question of why the man had killed 
himself with cold and that would 
mean thinking about the dreams 
again. 

But the colonist status displays 
showed only the pale blue that indi- 
cated awakenings for exercise only. 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



139 




Except for the negative indication 
beside the name and number of 
Yvonne Caldwell— and he had 
switched off that particular system 
after the girl had died— there was no 
evidence of a cubicle malfunction, 
which should have registered if a 
casket had been empty. 

For a wild moment he wondered if 
the man had belonged on the ship or 
if he had wandered in from outside 
and the whole thing was, after all, 
just a complex simulation in which 
they were all being tested. Then he 
remembered the dead girl who had 
dreamed of being a female dinosaur. 
Could she have been undergoing the 
same kind of psycho-drug treatment 
as the dead man and himself? 

Two colonists and one crew mem- 
ber had been or were being fed 
advanced and possibly experimental 
forms of psycho-drug. Of a comple- 
ment of over two hundred, what 
were the chances of any three 
people’s— chosen at random— being 
special subjects? Just how many 
people on the ship were undergoing 
the treatment? And why didn’t the 
dead man’s absence from his casket 
register on the status board? 

Without being able to work it out 
exactly, he knew that a fairly large 
proportion of the ship’s personnel 
would have to be undergoing the 
treatment for the first two he had 
encountered to be special subjects. 

But wait. Were the three subjects 
truly random samples? The Caldwell 
girl was— she had suffered an accident 
with her cold sleep casket and died 



before the side effects of the treat- 
ment had become manifest. But the 
dead man was a different matter— a 
subject who had found Devlin be- 
cause the treatment had driven him 
to his death in the corridor. It could 
be argued that if a large number of 
colonists were being treated the ship 
should be filled with permanently 
cold-and dead— bodies. 

Perhaps it was. 

Devlin shook his head violently, 
trying to discard that ridiculous idea 
and to jolt his mind into producing a 
more reasonable one. The status 
board and its associated monitoring 
system were designed to show the 
condition of each and every person 
on the ship. The dead man either did 
not belong to the ship or he was a 
colonist who had somehow devised a 
way of leaving his cubicle and con- 
cealing his absence from the moni- 
toring system. Devlin’s first step 
would be to find out who the man 
was if he did belong to the ship, and 
an examination of his cubicle should 
then show how he had been able to 
fool the monitor. 

It occurred to him that a simple 
answer would be to open all the 
cubicles in turn until he found, or 
did not find, one that was empty. 
But he dismissed that idea as too 
impractical and time-consuming. In- 
stead he would try to identify the 
man by searching his new, recently 
improved memory. He would be 
looking at events and people in his 
own past— a fairly safe and pain-free 
area in which to explore. 



140 



GALAXY 




D evlin put on warm coveralls 
and returned to the- section of 
corridor containing the dead man. He 
detached him from the wall net and 
towed him back to the control cen- 
ter, where he placed the body on the 
spare couch. For a few minutes he 
focused a heater on the head and 
shoulders— then he carefully removed 
the tape from the eyelids and pressed 
them down until they were half- 
closed. 

The heat had made the features 
look expressionless but natural. He 
tried harder to remember therri. 

Most of the lectures had been 
given in small rooms with rarely 
more than a dozen people present. 
Devlin concentrated on recalling a 
particular sequence and gradually the 
still features of the dead man became 
overlaid with the mobile, incredibly 
wrinkled face of the project’s chief 
psychologist. The old man was seated 
at a desk behind which was a wall 
chart containing information and 
hundreds of small photographs of the 
ship’s personnel. 

“...you people represent the final 
intake for this ship,” Martin was 
saying in his deep, resonant voice. 
“There will be no chance for all of 
you to get to know each other before 
the end of the trip, but we are fairly 
sure that your predecessors and your- 
selves will be fully compatible—” 
“Excuse me, citizen, a question.” 
Devlin turned around to look at 
the questioner— a small, beautiful, 
dark-haired girl whose timidity was 
apparent in her tone and overly 



respectful manner. No person would 
normally address another as citizen 
unless he wore a gun-belt and Martin 
was as beltless as any sheep. She was, 
Devlin realized with a rush of hind- 
sight, the girl who would accidentally 
kill herself in Blue 3 1 —and who 
might have been lucky to have died 
when and how she died rather than 
live until her dreams drove her to 
self-destruction. 

He forced his mind back to the 
girl’s question, not looking at the 
mind-picture of her as much as at the 
other faces of the group, which 
should have included that of the 
dead man. He did not see it. 

The psychologist must have 
nodded because the girl went on, 
“Surely we will be compatible. I 
mean, it cannot be your intention to 
transplant all the conflict and 
viciousness of our society to— to— ” 

She had lost her timidity, Devlin 
noted, just before losing her voice. 
He faced to the front again as Martin 
replied, “To be perfectly frank, our 
intentions are not clear even to our- 
selves. Certainly we do not intend to 
turn loose all the. social and psycho- 
logical ills of Earth on your future 
home, but we cannot be absolutely 
sure that we will not. We do not 
believe that we will because we are 
selecting and educating normal, aver- 
age people. 

“This appears to us to be the 
safest course,” he went on plea- 
santly, “because supermen and super- 
women are unpredictable during long 
periods in nonstress situations. Their 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



141 




treatment and training of their off- 
spring are likewise uncertain, because 
their children are unlikely to be 
superchildren and the superparents 
may be unable to accept that fact. 
The result will be personalities sub- 
jected to abnormal pressures during 
the formative stage and pressures of 
abnormal kindness or abnormal 
cruelty can be equally damaging. 
There is also the high probability 
that the genetic backgrounds of the 
parents, the characteristics that made 
them superior in the first place, are 
in themselves abnormal-and that a 
strength in one area is usually bal- 
anced by a weakness in another. 

“Since we are unwilling to export 
unnecessary abnormalities to the 
stars,” he continued, pulling up the 
corners of his lipless mouth and 
modulating his tone to express 
humor, “we have decided to educate 
people who are moderately honest, 
moderately unselfish and even mod- 
erately abnormal...” 

The words, the tone, the smallest 
changes in expression of that blood- 
hound’s face came back to Devlin the 
way sensorama plays were supposed 
to but did not. Devlin went back a 
few minutes to look at the memory 
sequence again, but this time he was 
concentrating on the chart con- 
taining the photographs behind the 
old man. 

P ERFECT recall, Devlin discov- 
ered at once, did not improve 
the eyesight. He had to go back over 
the episode three times before he was 



able to remember a photograph, in- 
distinct with distance, that might 
have been that of the dead man. The 
adjacent color-coding indicated that 
he was a colonist due for cooling in 
Red 23, and the status board gave his 
name as Thomas Purdy. 

What, he wondered again, have 
they done to my mind? 

But the question brought on a 
rush of too-perfect dream memories 
and, in self-defense, he returned to 
the memory of the lecture. The old 
man, Martin, had not seemed to 
mind interruptions, so that Devlin 
was able to listen again to Patricia, 
who had been sitting beside him, and 
the Caldwell girl. They had started 
by asking questions but had pro- 
gressed to a three-way debate on the 
advisability of sending untrained per- 
sonnel on such an important mission. 

He could not remember anyone’s 
asking if it were possible, after join- 
ing, to quit the project. Judging by 
his own feelings and those of Pa- 
tricia, everyone was so glad to have 
been given the chance to run away 
from everything that the thought had 
not entered their heads— which said a 
great deal for the effectiveness- of the 
initial selection procedures. But sup- 
pose that some of the personnel 
chosen were expendables, guinea pigs 
who would be tested to destruction 
in order to increase the chances of 
survival for the others. 

The most important items to be 
tested, as far as he and the project 
were concerned, had been his mind 
and memory. 



142 



GALAXY 




The memory of his first decision 
awakening came rushing .back— the 
intense, almost physical pain of his 
disappointment at having to pass that 
beautiful but doomed world. Then 
came the fly-by of Target Five, the 
evasive action he had taken and the 
memory of its physically repulsive 
and warlike natives. 

He had already convinced himself 
that the ship was real, that it was 
light-years from home and that the 
things he remembered when he was 
awake were real. But now he was 
reversing, or at least weakening, that 
conviction. If his dreams were as 
sharp and detailed and intense as his 
waking memories-what, if anything, 
was real? Was it any more difficult to 
produce a full sensory hallucination 
of a space battle with extra ter- 
restrials than a near-massacre in med- 
ieval setting or the adventures of a 
giant saurian? 

Possibly not. But there was one 
essential difference between his 
dream and his waking shipboard ex- 
periences. During the former he had 
no control over the incidents that 
occurred— no matter how hard he 
tried there seemed to be no way of 
altering the results. With the latter, 
however, he had a choice. He had the 
power of deciding, for instance, 
whether he would leave the dead 
Purdy on the couch or carry him 
back to his cubicle. 

He was on a real ship or on a 
completely real simulation of the 
ship. In either case anything that 
happened to him between the pre- 



sent moment and the time he re- 
turned to cold sleep or died, was real. 
He left the control center and headed 
for Purdy’s cubicle to see how the 
other had managed to fool the com- 
puter into thinking that he was still 
in residence. 



T he manual override allowed him 
to open the cubicle without ini- 
tiating the resuscitation sequence, 
and the answer was obvious as soon 
as he bent over the casket. But the 
question still remained— how had 
I^rdy let himself out of a colonist 
cubicle? Where could he have picked 
up the highly specialized knowledge 
to do so? 

Purdy had been desperate but 
logical. Unsure of the extent of the 
computer’s sensors and incapable of 
finding a way of killing himself that 
would be effective before a crew 
member could be roused to go to his 
assistance, he must have examined 
the personnel status board and found 
the answer in Blue 3 1 . 

Devlin had switched off Blue 31 
when the occupant died. With the 
sensors out of action there was no 
way for the computer to know 
whether the girl’s body was or was 
not still there, so Purdy had moved it 
to his own casket. The sensors did 
not operate during cold sleep, only 
while resuscitation was in progress to 
monitor the physical condition of 
the occupant, so the substitution had 
gone unnoticed. But when the occu- 
pant of Purdy’s cubicle became due 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



143 




for revival, the substitution would be 
noticed— but as a substitution. It 
would be flagged as an organic mal- 
function for the attention of a crew 
member, probably Devlin himself. 

Except that by then Devlin might 
also show as an organic malfunction, 
because the dead Purdy could be in 
Devlin’s casket while he himself has 
dead in another part of the ship and 
long past caring. 

Purdy had shown him the way 
out. 

On his way back to the control 
center he passed the open door of his 
own cubicle and the closed one with 
Patricia’s name on it. He had been 
trying not to think and trying ex- 
pecially hard not to remember, but 
he knew there were problems for him 
to face other than the simple, 
mechanical one of committing sui- 
cide. That was why he was going to 
return Purdy to the man’s own 
cubicle, for a short time, anyway, so 
that he would have the control cen- 
ter to himself while he tried to face 
his problems. 

Until recently— a few weeks or six 
centuries ago— he had done his best 
thinking when he was alone. 

But something was happening in 
the control center when he returned 
from Purdy’s cubicle for the second 
time. One of the repeater screens was 
glowing with a message, but he was 
too far away and the angle was too 
acute for him to read it. By the time 
he reached his couch the message was 
gone, to be replaced quickly with 
another.

Patricia had been awakened to 
discover why he was absent from his 
cubicle and the computer had 
warned her against the possibility of 
finding his mind rather than his body 
malfunctioning— which meant that 
the project’s psychologists and pro- 
gramers had also been aware of this 
possibility. Very carefully Devlin 
kept his mind on his present sur- 
roundings and his eyes on the en- 
trance to the control center. 

It would take her half an hour to 
finish her resuscitation exercises, find 
his cubicle empty and come to con- 
trol. He wondered if she would be as 
terrified of going to sleep as he was 
or if she would be able to help him 
find an answer different from 
Purdy’s.

H er face was still and calm and 
lovely and as stiff as chiseled 
marble. When she spoke her voice 
was under tight control. 

“What are you doing out of your 
cubicle? Are you all right?” 

Devlin nodded and tried to smile. 
He said, “There’s nothing wrong with 
me. At least, nothing more serious 
than a case of self-induced in- 
somnia.” 

Suddenly she launched herself at 
him, knocking him backward into his 
couch. Her arms were wrapped 
around him so tightly that he found 
it difficult to breathe and she was 
trembling. He did not have to be a 
medic to be able to diagnose despera- 
tion rather than desire. With one arm 
he held her as tightly as she was 
holding him, feeling the warmth of 
her body through the metal mesh. 
With his free hand he stroked her 
hair which, because it was long and 
thick, still retained the icy cold of 
the cubicle. 

“What’s wrong?” he asked softly. 
“Bad dreams?” 

Her face was pressed too tightly 
against his chest for her to speak, but 
he felt her nod.- 

“I was hoping,” he said, “to meet 
someone on this ship who was not 
troubled by unpleasant dreams. It 
might have helped to disprove a 
theory of mine.” 

When she did not reply for several 
seconds he said, “We’ll talk about 



it— you’ll be all right, you’ll see. And 
there is at least one answer to bad 
dreams. It is a bit drastic— and only 
to be used as a last resort— but it has 
been used at least once.” 

Devlin fell silent. Patricia was still 
trembling in his arms, but his posi- 
tion on the couch was very pleasant. 
Despite his confusion and anxiety 
about the ship and his terrible fear of 
going to sleep again, he began to 
react physically to the situation. As 
his fear and confusion ebbed, other 
memories rushed in to fill the 
spaces— memories of incidents in his 
own past as well as a flood of dream 
episodes of a similar nature involving 
females which, in many cases, were 
not even human. All at once his need 
for her became so great that he, too, 
began to shake. 

Suddenly, violently, she pushed 
herself away from him and the 
couch, crying silently and shaking 
her head. 

“What’s wrong?” he asked angrily. 
But he knew the answer as soon as he 
asked the question. In fact, virtually 
every item of the dream material was 
supplying its own answer. Very few 
of those episodes had been pleasant 
for the female concerned. 

“Put on a coverall,” he said more 
quietly, “and sit on the other couch. 
I know what’s bothering you and 
I-won’t.” 

She relaxed enough to smile 
briefly, then tightened up again. Dev- 
lin turned his head away as she began 
pulling on the coveralls. He won- 
dered why he felt more embarrassed

watching her dress than seeing her 
naked. When she returned to the 
couch a few minutes later he told her 
of his confusion regarding the voy- 
age -or the simulation of a voyage— 
and of his uncertainty as to whether 
everyone or only an unlucky few 
were having dream trouble. He told 
her about the solution Purdy had 
found to the problem and waited for 
her reaction. 

She said finally, “I’m glad you’re 
all right.” 

He turned on her, suddenly 
furious at her for putting the whole 
problem on a personal basis, then 
silenced his tongue behind clenched 
teeth. He knew that she was con- 
cerned for the other people in the 
ship and also afraid of what had been 
happening in her mind. And her 
feeling for his health and sanity did 
not have to be entirely selfish. 

“I’m sorry,” he said. “I shouldn’t 
have— Well, let’s both try to relax 
and talk about the problem without 
getting too uptight about it. That 
sounds stupid— what I mean is if our 
talk brings back something really 
unpleasant, let’s sidetrack it by 
thinking of something nice. Re- 
membering a difficult piece of music 
you may have heard at a concert is 
probably a good way. Nothing 
terribly unpleasant ever happens at a 
concert.” 

“Except,” she said, smiling,“if 
there’s a bomb hoax or the music is 
boring— I remember once going to 
sleep.” 

“You just said a dirty word,” said 



Devlin. “But do you have any ideas? 
Suicide isn’t a good answer for us.” 
“No future in it,” she said. “And 
we’re supposed to be the future.” 
She shivered again. “I never thought 
of just plain tomorrow-of just 
taking another breath— as an awe- 
some responsibility. But I agree with 
you— what happened to the CaldweU 
girl and Purdy makes it unlikely that 
all this— the whole ship— is a simula- 
tion. However, whether it is or is not 
isn’t important. What’s happening to 
our minds is. And so is the ques- 
tion— is the dream trouble happening 
to everyone or only to a few of us?” 
Devlin nodded. “Right. We could 
probably establish the number of 
disturbed dreamers by studying the 
status board, calling up the details of 
their awakenings and checking if any 
of them resisted, by even an hour, 
the return to cold sleep. A check on 
the consumables will tell us if they 
stayed awake inside their boxes 
rather than breaking out to commit a 
Purdy style body swap and suicide.” 
“Does that mean,” she broke in, 
“that you think some of the people 
in the cubicles are already dead?” 
Devhn shook his head. “I don’t see 
how they could have managed it. If 
they killed themselves prior to or 
during a cooldown, it would have 
been flagged as a malfunction and a 
crew member would have been 
awakened to investigate— you were 
awakened, remember, to check on a 
possible malfunction in me. I was 
required to check on the Caldwell 
girl.”

S HE was silent for a moment. 

Then: “I’m frightened. Some of 
my dreams were so depressing that if 
I deliberately recalled them I, too, 
might think that suicide was the only 
answer. But I don’t want to think as 
Purdy evidently did. Maybe he was in 
an earlier intake. We don’t know 
what kind of person he was— perhaps 
he was flawed in some fashion. I 
realize this is wishful thinking and 
not logic, but I don’t want him to 
influence us too much-or the people 
who awaken later. There might be a 
chain-reaction of suicides,” she 
ended grimly. 

Devlin reached for her hand. She 
did not pull it away. 

“Suppose Purdy was tlie first to 
encounter this problem,” he said, 
“and we are the second. I didn’t 
know him at all, but there is one 
difference between his case and 
ours— he didn’t have anyone to talk 
to. It could be an important differ- 
ence.” She nodded wordlessly and he 
said, “Let’s check the status board-” 
It took many hours of concen- 
trated, repetitious effort to call up 
and study each awakening in turn 
and to check each one for evidence 
of abnormal behavior or refusal of a 
colonist to return to his or her casket 
at the specified time. But all seemed 
normal. 

Devlin decided to make spot 
checks on the cubicles and look for 
the evidence at first hand. The job 
would have gone faster if he and 
Patricia had split it between them, 
but somehow it was easier for them 



to keep their minds off unpleasant 
memories when they worked to- 
gether. 

Opening a statistically meaningful 
number of cubicles— performing the 
sequence of operations that allowed 
entry without initiating warmup of 
the occupant— took an additional 
three hours. But the effort required 
to control their minds— of looking at 
cold sleepers time after time without 
allowing themselves to think about 
the dreams that had to be going on 
inside those frozen heads— was much 
more tiring than the physical work 
involved. When they returned to the 
control center, still without the evi- 
dence of abnormalities, their voices 
were slurred with fatigue and they 
kept yawning in each other’s faces. 

But their fatigue was filled with 
the fear of going to sleep-it kept 
them moving about when they 
should have been resting in the 
couches. To help each other stay 
awake they ran another detailed 
check on the status board and found 
nothing, except for one minor de- 
parture from norm that seemed to 
have no bearing on their problem. 

Devlin said wearily, “1 feel stupid. 
But surely everytliing can’t be as 
simple as it seems.” 

Patricia’s face was pale with weari- 
ness so that the scar tissue on her 
cheek stood out like an embossed 
pink star. She said, “I’ve been doing 
some tliinking. The Caldwell girl 
doesn’t really come into our present 
picture-she died accidentally a long 
time ago— and the only thing Purdy 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



147 




had in common with us was that we 
three have been awakened more 
often than the others.” 

“Right,” said Devlin, “Purdy and 
we have had one extra awakening. 
The computer says he had a test 
warmup during the first few years of 
the trip to check on the accuracy of 
the resuscitation timers. I had an 
extra awakening to attend to the 
Caldwell girl and you were warmed 
because of me. That means the 
trouble could affect everyone in the 
ship at their next awakening. We are 
not special cases— we have simply had 
an early warning.” 

“We ought to pass it along. We 
have to tell the others what to 
expect-” 

“They’ll know the problem as 
soon as they’re awake, damn it. What 
you mean is that we have to think of 
a solution to it for them. And I’m 
too tired to think of anything.” 

“I’m tired, too,” she said angrily, 
“and it keeps me from saying exactly 
what I mean. I meant that we must 
find a better answer than Purdy’s.” 
“How much time,” Devlin asked 
sharply, “do we have to find it? How 
long can we stay awake?” 

She made no reply and he could 
see his own fear mirrored in her 
expression. He said, “I’m sorry. If we 
don’t stop snapping at each other 
we’ll have to send out for a couple of 
belts. Let’s try, despite our fatigue, 
to think about Purdy’s answer. Let’s 
examine it, and the situation that 
drove him to it, in case there is 
something there that we can use.” 



T hey had to assume that Purdy 
had been terrified by his dreams 
and that he had tried hard to find an 
answer other than suicide. Probably 
he had tried so long and so hard that 
he had reached the same stage of 
physical and mental exhaustion as 
Devlin and Patricia were experi- 
encing. But Purdy had been all alone. 
He had not been selfish enough to 
wake someone else to share his 
troubles, but he had not panicked. 

Knowing that he had to sleep 
sooner or later, he had delayed sleep- 
ing for as long as possible by taping 
open his eyelids. Then, after 
stripping off his coverall, he had gone 
to an extremely cold section of the 
corridor and arranged himself so that 
the greatest possible area of his 
body’s surface was in contact with 
the cold plating. The taped-up eye- 
lids and the freezing cold metal 
would have kept him awake for some 
time, but eventually he had fallen 
asleep— and had probably dreamed 
briefly before dying. 

“The extreme fatigue we feel and 
that Purdy presumably felt bothers 
me,” Devlin said thoughtfully. “All 
of us were fit at the beginning of the 
voyage, which was only a matter of 
days ago in biological time -and we 
have not been working so hard on 
the ship that we should be ready to 
drop from exhaustion like this.” 

He paused, squeezed his eyes shut 
and shook his .head violently, trying 
to jostle his brain cells into increased 
activity. Then: “Suppose the project 
people made a fundamental error in 



148 



GALAXY 




thinking that the long periods in cold 
sleep were enabling us to rest— a 
justifiable assumption. But let’s sup- 
pose that in reality the cold sleep 
preserved the body’s fatigue toxins 
along with everything else and that 
we haven’t in fact slept properly 
since the day before we entered the 
caskets on Earth. Sleep deprivation 
causes some odd mental effects— dis- 
orientation, reduced self-confidence, 
that sort of thing.” 

“Are you suggesting,” Patricia 
asked, smiling, “that we should have 
been awakened periodically and told 
to go to sleep?” 

“Yes,” said Devlin, “if they 
wanted us to stay mentally alert.” 

He did not smile. 

Despite her fatigue she saw what 
he was driving at and began shaking 
her head violently. 

“I know how you feel— I feel the 
same way,” Devlin said. “But we 
won’t be able to think properly 
about anything until we’ve rested, 
even if it is only for a few hours. And 
we won’t be asleep at the same time. 
One of us will stay awake to rouse 
the other if the sleep appears to be 
disturbed— we won’t be in a cold 
casket, unable to stop dreaming. At 
the first sign of distress— I’ll explain 
about the mechanics of sleep, the eye 
movements behind the closed lids 
that indicate natural dreaming and so 
on— the other person will rouse the 
sleeper. We have to try it,” he 
finished firmly. “I’ll go first.” 

But as soon as he said the words 
his fatigue disappeared, driven away 



by the terror of dozens of remem- 
bered dyings. He could see that the 
same terror had the girl in its grip, 
but when she spoke his strongest 
emotion was one of shameful relief. 

“If we are going to try it I’ll go 
first,” she whispered. “You have a 
better idea of the symptoms to 
watch for.” 

But it was not easy to make her 
relax. She kept fighting sleep for 
what seemed like hours, even though 
Devlin spoke softly to her, held her 
hands and finally reran a close-range 
probe sequence from his first obser- 
vation awakening which showed the 
beautiful, park-like scenery of the 
satellite of Planet Three. Gradually 
her eyes began to close more and 
more frequently and remain closed 
for longer and longer periods. Her 
breathing became deep and regular 
after she passed the restive period on 
the threshold of sleep, but there were 
no indications of disturbance or dis- 
tress. 

Devlin rubbed his eyes and 
thought. Poor Purdy... 

Watching her he wondered what 
was going on in the mind behind that 
lovely tranquil face and if it were 
possible that the fearfully sharp and 
intense dreams they had both experi- 
enced could go on without some 
outward sign becoming apparent. He 
did not think so— and gradually he 
began to feel a little envious of her 
escape. He remembered the young 
king tired after a strenuous training 
session with Hawn or lying exhausted 
in the arms of his favorite— and the 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



149 




feel of sunshine and warm mud on 
his enormous, leathery body as he 
dozed in the shallows of a prehistoric 
lake... 

He came awake to find Patricia 
shaking his shoulder and smiling. She 
said, “I don’t know how long you’ve 
been asleep, but I’ve had nine hours. 
As a sentry you’re a total loss!” 

XV 

44TTOW DO YOU feel? Have 
XJ-any unpleasant dreams?” 

She shook her head. “I feel fine.” 
“Me, too,” said Devlin. “But we 
should try to remember as much as 
possible to discover the difference 
between cold sleep and the normal 
kind of dreaming. It might help us to 
understand what is going on.” 

Devhn had never been very good 
at recalling dreams— he had been con- 
vinced that he did not dream at all 
until he discovered during his medical 
training that everyone dreamed. But 
now, with very little effort, he found 
that he could bring back the memory 
of what his mind had been doing 
while he had been asleep. 

There had been chaotic flashes of 
dozens of unrelated incidents, a kind 
of sorting and sifting through the 
records of his last waking period. His 
sleeping mind had tried to impose 
some kind of order and sense on 
them, with the result that people and 
places and incidents and timing were 
mixed in a fantasy world that was 
ridiculous rather than frightening. 
Some dreams had been logical within 



themselves, had consisted of events, 
imagined or remembered, that fairly 
shouted out his fears regarding the 
voyage and his own reduced proba- 
bilities of surviving it. His cold sleep 
memories had intruded also, but not 
seriously enough to scare him 
awake— and there had been one odd 
sequence involving Brother Howard. 

The Brother had been talking 
seriously to him and Devlin had 
replied occasionally, but the whole 
sequence had been completely silent. 

He asked Patricia, “Find any- 
thing?” 

“I don’t think so,” she said. “But 
then. I’m not sure what I’m looking 
for. There was nothing in the dreams 
as frightening or intense as in the 
cold sleep kind, although I’m pretty 
sure that if I tried I could recall them 
in just as much detail— my memory 
seems to be enormously improved. 
Some of the incidents— one involving 
Brother Howard, for instance— were 
completely ridiculous. I’m— very 

hungry.” 

“What did you say?” 

“I’m hungry,” she repeated. “And 
I know that we shouldn’t really be 
awake and should not, therefore, 
draw on the ship’s consumables. But 
being practical— Well, Purdy and the 
Caldwell girl will not be using their 
allowance and we could—” 

“A good idea. But I didn’t mean 
to ask about your hunger. You men- 
tioned dreaming about Brother 
Howard. Was the dream silent? Did 
he talk during it, but you couldn’t 
hear him or yourself speaking?” 



150 



GALAXY 




She did not reply, but her ex- 
pression was answer enough. Once 
again he wondered what had been 
done to their minds. 

After a long and baffled silence he 
said, “Well, it seems that we can stay 
warm and eat and sleep for about 
two weeks without using anyone 
else’s rations. That should give us 
enough time to come up with some 
alternatives. I feel happier thinking 
about this in my own language, but if 
I forget something or seem to be 
going wrong, don’t be afraid to in- 
terrupt, right? Now suppose we treat 
our problem as a dangerous and 
possibly lethal symptom of a disease. 
The first step would be to find out 
how the infection, or whatever it is, 
was introduced into our systems.” 

T he possibilities, Devlin went on 
to explain, were that it had been 
deliberately introduced by mechani- 
cal means, either before the voyage 
had started or during it. If the 
former, it had delayed-action effects 
that were only now becoming mani- 
fest. If the latter, the effects were 
cumulative and the method of intro- 
duction was probably incorporated 
in the cooldown processing or it was 
taken with the food or water. 

“In that case,” Patricia broke in 
worriedly, “we shouldn’t eat or 
drink.” 

“When we get hungry and thirsty 
enough.“ Devhn said wr>dy, “we’ll 
find good reasons why it could not 
have been introduced with the food 
and water. But right now we have to 



search the ship’s cold sleep and life- 
support systems for indications that 
some form of medication is being 
introduced. We must also search our 
memories for clues to some form of 
treatment that might have been given 
to us before we left Earth. 

“I don’t know any more than 
you do what we are looking for. It 
could be a hallucinogenic drug, direct 
modification of memory psycho- 
radiation techniques-they were 
getting very good at that sort of 
thing before I left the hospital— or 
post-hypnotic verbal or visual triggers 
for an implanted memory sequence 
placed during training. Or it could be 
a mixture of all three— and/or in 
combination with drugs or techni- 
ques we can’t even guess at. One 
good thing is that we can look at two 
sources of infection— the ship and 
our training period memories— at the 
same time.” 

But their detailed examination of 
the ship’s cold-sleep, life-support and 
food-dispenser systems turned up 
nothing suspicious. True, the infor- 
mation was available only through 
the relevant computer displays and it 
was possible that the computer had 
been programed to conceal the data 
they were seeking. But such precau- 
tions would have introduced highly 
dangerous complications irito the 
mission— Devlin felt he had to assume 
that the information given was ac- 
curate. Still,, to check on this accu- 
racy both he and Patricia returned 
again and again to memories of their 
training, to lectures and simulations. 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



151 . 




conversational asides and wall charts, 
circuit diagrams and stores inven- 
tories— their ability to remember, 
whatever the reason for it, continued 
phenomenal. One important piece of 
information they learned was that 
the ship was pushing hard against its 
limits of operational safety. 

The next fly-by, due in just under 
one hundred and eighty-one years, 
would probably be the last with a 
fully functioning ship. 

46 T WISH we hadn’t found out 

X about that,” said Devlin later, 
while they were discussing their find- 
ings in the control center. “We’re still 
trying to solve the cold sleep prob- 
lem and knowledge of that fact tends 
to sidetrack one’s train of thought.” 

“Not necessarily,” she replied. 
“The data on the next target system 
looks good— one of the best pros- 
pects we’ve had, in fact. Would it be 
possible for us to reprogram the 
computer so as not to awaken any- 
one at all until we go into landing 
orbit?” 

Devlin shook his head. “One of 
the things drummed into us was the 
necessity for mental and physical 
exercise at regular intervals. Besides, 
I wouldn’t like to fool around with 
programs as important as that.” 

“But one of the things they were 
worried about,” she argued, “was the 
possibility of memory loss. Reduced 
temperatures were supposed to allow 
the electro-chemical charges used for 
memory storage to leak away. That is 
not happening.” 



“I know, I know,” said Devlin 
irritably. “Our problem is that we 
seem to be registering too many 
memories, not losing • them. But 
you’re forgetting that the period will 
be much longer than one hundred 
and eighty -one years. If the fly-by 
shows a planet suitable for coloniza- 
tion we have to decelerate and re- 
turn, so that it could be three times 
that length of time before we are in 
landing orbit. Even if we could be 
sure there would be no physical or 
mental deterioration I’m still not 
convinced that we should risk an 
arbitrary cold-sleep period unbroken 
for more than five hundred years. To 
crib from Shakespeare— what dreams 
might come?” 

“But we must do something!” 

Devlin was about to snap back at 
her, but he stopped himself in time. 
They were both tired and anxiety, as 
it usually did, was making him 
hungry. 

He smiled and said, “Let’s eat.” 

She yawned suddenly. “And 
sleep.” 

Neither of them was afraid of 
what might happen during a warm 
sleep and both of them felt relaxed 
in their couches. But, perversely, 
sleep would not come. Devlin’s mind 
would not leave the problem of the 
cold dreams and Patricia could not 
stop talking about it. 

“From what you’ve just been say- 
ing,” she said after yet another exer- 
cise in circular logic, “we can be 
sure— or fairly sure— that any of the 
psycho-drugs, whether they were 



152 



GALAXY 




hallucinogens, personality changers 
or whatever, would not remain active 
over this length of time. Despite the 
fact that an efficient cooldown sys- 
tem is supposed to halt all chemical 
and metabolic reactions, those partic- 
ular drugs are composed of unstable 
material which is also highly complex 
structurally. Too, the most effective 
ones had not been in existence long 
enough before our departure for prop- 
er long-term tests, a couple of cen- 
turies or more, to be carried out. The 
project planners would hardly have 
risked the success of this mission by 
using drugs with long-term effects 
that could have mental effects on us 
they were unable to predict.” 

Devlin replied tiredly, “Still, they 
may have taken the risk.” 

She shook her head. “If they had 
administered any of the known ef- 
fective— and unstable— drugs, any bio- 
chemical instability would react 
against the original purpose of the 
drug. Our memories would have re- 
mained normal or perhaps even faded 
instead of becoming sharper, as has 
happened. More likely such in- 
stability and subsequent breakdown 
of the chemical structure would have 
caused severe and apparent brain 
damage and, at very least, the type of 
hallucination generally encountered 
with derivatives of LSD. We have had 
nightmares— and bad ones— but they 
were invariably self-consistent.” 

“You are saying then,” said Dev- 
lin, rubbing his eyes, “that they 
didn’t adminster a psycho-drug.” 
“Not exactly,” she replied. “They 



could have administered something 
that would not change over a long 
period because it was nonmaterial. 
The treatment could have been 
hypnotic rather than biochemical.” 

D evlin rolled onto his side so 
that he could look across at her. 
He said, “All right— let’s kick that 
around. Hypno-conditioning is af- 
fected only by the passage of bio- 
logical time, so as far as our con- 
scious minds are concerned the con- 
ditioning took place only days or 
weeks ago. Assuming you’re right, it 
was probably administered at inter- 
vals during training. But we’re still 
left with questions.” 

“I know that. But I think some- 
thing like it is probably close to the 
true explanation.” 

“Until we know the true explana- 
tion,” he said dryly, “I can’t answer 
that. But assuming it is the right or 
nearly right answer, think of the 
work involved for the project staff. 
Hypnotizing us and concealing the 
fact with various forms of post-hyp- 
notic suggestion would have been the 
easiest part of the job. The rest 
would have had to consist of sub- 
jecting us to the right sensory im- 
pressions— and fine psycho-surgical 
work of a type that needs a lot of 
time. I don’t know when all that 
could have happened. But my 
strongest objection to your theory is 
based on the quality and detail of the 
dreams themselves and the apparent 
duration of the dream sequences. I 
say apparent because I know how 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM

time can be telescoped during condi- 
tioning, but those dreams went on 
for years. Still, assuming your idea to 
be correct in every detail,” Devlin 
ended, “how does it help us?” 

“I’m not sure,” she replied. “But 
wouldn’t it be possible to search our 
memories of the training period for 
time gaps and try to use our im- 
proved memories to break those 
post-hypnotic commands? Alterna- 
tively, isn’t it possible that if we go 
over some of those dream sequences 
again— the humdrum episodes as well 
as the more dramatic bits— we might 
be able to spot the joins or see some 
evidence artificiality or error in the 
dreams?” 

Devlin sat up suddenly and swung 
his legs off the couch. He said, “1 see 
what you’re driving at. You’re sug- 
gesting that if we can demonstrate 
that the dreams have been imposed 
from without we can communicate 
this fact to the otliers and perhaps 
convince them that it is possible to 
negate the worst effects.” 

“That’s it,” she agreed. “Even 
when I dreamed of being a crusta- 
cean or a wolverine I was still aware 
of being myself. Maybe we can do or 
suggest something to strengthen that 
awareness.” 

Devlin nodded. “It might not be as 
simple as you make it sound,” he 
said, “but where do you want to 
start? With the dreams or actual 
memories?” 

“With memories,” she said firmly. 
“I’m very reluctant to go back to 
some of those dreams— and we just 



might find what we’re looking for in 
the real past. I realize that the actual 
conditioning sessions would not 
show because we have been ordered 
to forget them, but we must have 
undergone some prior mental prepar- 
ation. Brother Howard might have let 
something slip during those early 
meetings— in the park, at the project 
building or in the rec hall. If hypno- 
conditioning was being used, he must 
have known about it.” 

Devlin said, “I don’t think he let 
anything slip in the park or during 
his first visit to the block. I went 
over that day as a memory exercise 
during an earlier warm-up. It was a 
pleasant and important day for me— 
except for the riot on the way 
home— and I remembered it in con- 
siderable detail—” 

“Funny— I picked the same day to 
remember.” 

“We’ll go into the deep dark, 
psychological significance of that 
later—” Devlin smiled -“because if 
we did it now we probably could not 
remain objective about ourselves.” 
“Later that evening,” Patricia said, 
“Brother Howard was very objective 
about us. Objectionable, even.” 

“My cooldown warning came be- 
fore I was able to remember into the 
evening,” Devlin said, “and that was 
the time when the Brother spoke 
very freely. I’d like to go over that 
memory again, starting with the time 
when your father left us...” 

C ITIZEN MORLEY had been a 
small man who did not try to 



154 



GALAXY 




compensate for this fact by making a 
lot of noise. That night he wore an 
empty belt signifying that, although 
he was technically safe within and 
among the residents of his block, he 
was not entirely surrounded by his 
own family circle. When Brother 
Howard and Devlin found his table 
and were introduced by Patricia, her 
father, for all his mildness and friend- 
liness, looked quietly furious. 

She explained the presence of the 
Brother and doctor by saying that 
her self-inflicted wound had caused 
them to be concerned about her 
mental as well as her physical health 
and that the two men wanted to help 
her. Citizen Morley, as he handed her 
formally into their charge, said that 
he could not really blame his daugh- 
ter for doing as she had done, but it 
was obvious to Devlin that if Morley 
ever did find someone to blame that 
person’s life-expectancy would be 
drastically shortened. 

For their first few minutes alone 
at the table Patricia, Devlin and 
Howard had privacy of a sort. The 
Brother’s profession was obvious 
from his dress and Devlin’s from the 
ornate dress earring he wore on 
semi-social occasions. But a crowd of 
hfgh-spirited but essentially good 
youngsters— that was how the block 
sociologist described them— seemed 
intent on harrassing the two half- 
sheep. 

None of them were old enough to 
be citizens, which meant that theo- 
retically anyone living in the block 
who had reached maturity had the 



right to chastise them. In actual fact, 
however, no one who was not a full 
citizen with a large number of citizen 
relatives could do so if he or she 
expected to go on living, much less 
working, in the block. And in any 
case it would have been senseless to 
try chastising a group that out- 
numbered the trio five to one. 

Devlin suggested adjournment to 
the roof. 

The high-spirited but “essentially 
good” youngsters were not allowed 
on the roof lest they render it as 
uninhabitable for ordinary people as 
the Maxers made the city parks at 
night. But Brother Howard and Dev- 
lin were adults and responsible, theo- 
retically, even though they were not 
citizens. And the fact that Citizen 
Morley had placed himself on duty 
with the roof security party, which 
searched them for weapons, saved a 
lot of red tape. 

A cold wind was blowing from the 
sea, dissipating the air wastes inland 
and carrying away the sounds of 
desultory gunfire from the business 
districts. The three found a radiant 
plate, which at once provided shelter 
from the wind and gave a good view 
of the city through the anti-suicide 
netting while its warmtli bathed their 
backs. Occasionally a security man 
came along to check on the plate’s 
functioning— the plates were not 
there for the convenience of block- 
dwellers on cold nights, but as infra- 
red dazzlers against high-spirited but 
essentially good types in other blocks 
who wanted to shoot at roof security

men with heat-sighted or heat- 
seeking weapons. 

Brother Howard’s conversation 
that night, while interesting, was not 
very informative regarding the pro- 
ject. Without becoming openly in- 
sistent about it he was steadfastly 
refusing to change the subject— and 
the subject was Patricia. Without ever 
telling her why he wanted to know, 
the Brother found out a great deal 
about her— and Devlin knew enough 
to become finally aware that she was 
being subjected to one of the most 
expert verbal probings he had ever 
witnessed. 

After more than two hours of it 
there was an interruption— a sharp 
detonation and ground-level flash 
from a few miles away— which 
stopped the interrogation long 
enough for Devlin to ask a question. 

“Now that you know everything 
there is to know about Patricia,” he 
said, “I expect it will be my turn. 
Then, presumably, you will finally 
decide whether or not we are suitable 
candidates for training?” 

The light was too weak to enable 
Devlin to read Howard’s expression 
accurately, but the other sounded 
impatient as he replied, “I decided 
that you. Doctor, were suitable a few 
hours after meeting you for the first 
time. Deciding about Miss Morley is a 
longer and more difficult job, be- 
cause no man can get inside a 
woman’s mind and fully understand 
what is going on there. But don’t 
worry, either of you— you will be on 
the ship. The process you are shortly 



to undergo is not really training as 
much as a transfer of necessary infor- 
mation, an adult education exer- 
cise—” He broke off, then said 
worriedly, “I’m not sure of my bear- 
ings from this block. Doctor. Was 
that explosion close to the project 
building?” 

“No, nowhere near it—” A second 
and larger explosion occurred in the 
same area as Devlin spoke. Armored 
fire and ambulance units were jump- 
ing toward the trouble spot, their 
positions signaled by flashing blue 
lights and the strident donkey-call of 
their sirens. As they converged on 
the blaze set off by the explosions, 
heavy gunfire and a few armor- 
piercing rockets hammered at them 
from the surrounding darkness. The 
ambulance and fire-fighting units 
grounded themselves to protect their 
vulnerable undersides, unable to de- 
ploy their equipment. Then the lights 
and sirens of the city security 
heavies, a great many of them, came 
bounding to their support. It was 
rapidly becoming impossible to hold 
a conversation, even at a distance, 
without shouting. 

Citizen Morley appeared out of 
the darkness. 

“This looks like a bad one,” he 
said, speaking slowly and clearly. 
“The timing and tactics indicate co- 
operation between a large number of 
protesting factions and the incident, 
together with the city security re- 
action to it, is sure to involve a lot of 
uncommitted local residents. That 
will mean confusion and wild shoot-

ing. You will be safer in your room, 
Patricia— and I suggest that you 
gentlemen will also be more comfort- 
able below.” 

He could have sent them from the 
roof with a few short, sharp words, 
Devlin thought, but Patricia’s father 
was a citizen in the true sense of the 
word— firm, decisive, responsible and 
considerate. As he turned to go 
below Devlin’s last view of the inci- 
dent— the most serious of that 
week— was of a writhing, red and 
many-petaled flower growing rapidly 
in a bed of flickering blue stars. 

The sight had a terrible and all too 
familiar beauty... 

T he control center bulkheads 
took on substance behind the 
fading mind picture and Devlin said, 
“The initial explosion and his worry 
about the project building may have 
put the Brother off guard for a 
moment. Perhaps he did not mean to 
say what he did about training and 
education. I asked him about it later. 
If you give me a few minutes I’ll 
recall the conversation for you.” 

She shook her head and said, “I’m 
hungry.” 

“So am I.” 

“I’m more immediately worried 
about the others on board this ship,” 
she went on. “I think we’ve ex- 
hausted the subject of Brother 
Howard. Do we eat and sleep again 
or do we try to check cold dreams, as 
we planned?” 

Devlin sighed. “All right— we’ll 
check the dreams for faulty work- 



manship for a while. Then I’ll go 
back to Brother Howard talking on 
my surgery couch. But I suggest you 
begin with a pleasant episode.” 

Patricia shook her head again. 
“We’re not trying to protect them 
against pleasant dreams.” 

Devlin said angrily, “You can do 
just as you please, of course.” He lay 
back in his couch and stared straight 
ahead. He was beginning to realize 
that a girl strong-willed enough to 
disfigure herself for wholly unselfish 
reasons could, at times, have head- 
strong mannerisms that were not 
entirely charming. 

Very carefully he sent his memory 
probing. 

His biggest problem was his own 
ignorance. He did not know enough 
about the subject to pinpoint a 
possible technical error in the sen- 
sory impressions or environment of 
the trilobite or the giant saurian of 
his dreams, or tell if the weapons and 
armor given to the young king by 
Hawn were correct for that historical 
period. Some of the vegetation, 
coloration of fur and skin, methods 
of making and fastening clothing 
surprised him in retrospect, but were 
not necessarily incorrect. 

Timidly Devlin began to move into 
the actively unpleasant areas, even 
though he found it impossible to 
remember the finer details of en- 
vironment and sensation through the 
floods of remembered pain. He had 
the feeling that these dream portions 
were crude and melodramatic. If 
they were in fact psychological con- 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



157 




structs the people who might have 
implanted them might also have been 
a little careless. 

He had small knowledge of the 
physiology or nervous systems of the 
majority of the creatures he had 
dreamed himself to be— with one 
exception. The king had been a man, 
a human being, and Devlin knew 
humans as only a trained medic 
could know them. Very carefully he 
recalled the assassination, how the 
knife had felt going in, how it had 
felt inside the wound and how he 
had felt, going rapidly into shock 
from the loss of blood. Devlin 
went over the incident again and 
again. He could detect no technical 
or physiological errors. Suddenly he 
sat up. 

“Something’s wrong,” he said 
harshly. “Have you been going over 
the painful stuff, too?” 

She nodded. “A very unpleasant 
death in childbirth in a smelly cave 
with-” 

“You don’t seem unduly both- 
ered.” 

“No,” she said. “It wasn’t plea- 
sant, but it wasn’t nearly as bad as 
the first time I remembered it. Why 
is that?” 

Devlin was silent for a moment 
while he explained it to himself 
before he began giving her the an- 
swer. 

It was simply that Patricia and he 
had done something neither the Cald- 
well girl or Purdy had done- they 
had slept normally. The situation was 
analogous to the painful post-op- 



erative period following major sur- 
gery. The patient remembered the 
experience for the rest of his or her 
life— but the first good, sound sleep 
filtered out much of the memory of 
the associated suffering. 

IT’S as simple as that,” 
Patricia said when he had ex- 
plained. “When we were warmed and 
awakened from cold-sleep the 
memories were like a raw nerve. But 
after we slept naturally they became 
normal memories, unpleasant but not 
actually painful.” She laughed 
suddenly. “The others wUl be re- 
lieved when we tell that all they have 
to do when they are awakened is to 
go back to sleep.” 

Devlin did not smile. He was still 
worried at the prospect of another 
interminable session of cold 
dreaming. 

He said, “We probably do have the 
answer to the cold dream suicide 
problem, even though we still don’t 
know the cause and/or reasons for 
the dreams. But we can go on work- 
ing on that problem while we are 
waiting to be cooled. Right now we 
should tape instructions to the 
others,” he went on firmly, “and I 
see no reason for our eating while we 
are doing that. Unless you have a 
strong objection, 1 suggest that we go 
cold as quickly as possible.” 

“Yes,” she said, “before our feet 
get a chance to go cold before we 
do.” 

The message they composed was 
as simple as possible to avoid con- 



158 



GALAXY 




fusing people who would be freshly 
awakened and very frightened. 

URGENT MESSAGE FROM THE 
CREW TO BE GIVEN TO ALL COLO- 
NISTS AT EACH AWAKENING FROM 
COLD SLEEP. MESSAGE TO BE IN- 
SERTED BETWEEN PERSONAL 
GREETING AND SHIP STATUS RE- 
PORT. 

MESSAGE FOLLOWS. 

IT IS PROBABLE THAT INDIVID- 
UALS AMONG SHIP’S PERSONNEL 
ARE EXPERIENCING SEVERE MEN- 
TAL DISTRESS AS A RESULT OF 
DREAMS ENCOUNTERED DURING 
COLD SLEEP. THE REASON FOR THE 
INTENSITY OF THESE DREAMS IS 
NOT YET UNDERSTOOD, BUT THE 
DISTRESSING AFTER-EFFECTS CAN 
BE REDUCED BY ONE OR MORE 
PERIODS OF NORMAL SLEEP. 

SINCE IT NOW SEEMS LIKELY 
THAT COLD SLEEP DOES NOT PER- 
FORM THE PHYSIOLOGICAL AND 
PSYCHOLOGICAL REPAIR FUNC- 
TIONS OF NORMAL SLEEP, AND 
THAT FATIGUE TOXINS ARE ALSO 
PRESERVED INTACT DURING COLD 
SLEEP, THERE SHOULD BE NO DIFFI- 
CULTY EXPERIENCED IN SLEEPING 
NORMALLY. 

IF THE CONSCIOUS PERIOD SEEMS 
TOO SHORT FOR NORMAL SLEEP, 
EXTEND IT WITH THE EMERGENCY 
OVERRIDE FOR AS LONG AS NECES- 
SARY BUT BE SPARING OF CON- 
SUMABLES. 

CARRY OUT ALL OTHER PHYSI- 
CAL AND MENTAL EXERCISES AS 
INSTRUCTED. 

MESSAGE ENDS. 



They agreed that that message 
should do it, until Patricia became 
worried that the constant use of the 
manual overrides might worry the 
computer into waking the crew to 
check for possible physiological mal- 
functions in people who insisted on 
sleeping in their caskets instead of 
being out of them, exercising. It was 
a valid cause for worry, so they spent 
an additional few minutes modifying 
the computer instructions to cover 
this possiblity. Then they spent 
several minutes more in very close 
contact without, however, recalling 
unpleasant dream memories. 

As they were returning to their 
caskets Patricia said sadly, “Poor 
Purdy. If only he hadn’t managed to 
die in his sleep.” 

XVI 

H e had two hours before cool- 
down— more than enough time, 
Devlin thought, to recall the details 
of a conversation that could only 
have lasted for half of that period. 

Brother Howard had been tired, 
irritable and argumentative. Using 
hindsight, Devlin thought he might 
find that the Brother had also been 
less than careful about concealing his 
true intentions. At the time Devlin 
had not known enough to ask the 
right questions... 

“I don’t quite understand your 
acceptance standards, Brother,” Dev- 
lin said. “You keep insisting that the 
colonists are nothing special. In fact. 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



159 




you seem to suggest that their medi- 
ocrity is a virtue. Surely you must be 
looking for some special qualifica- 
tion?” 

For a few seconds Devlin thought 
that the Brother was not going to 
answer. He lay on the examination 
couch, fully dressed except for his 
shoes and high, tight collar. But then 
he stretched, sighed and said, “These 
days mediocrity is a special qualifica- 
tion.” 

“If it were as simple as that,” said 
Devlin, irritated, “all you would need 
of us would be our names, ages and 
respective genders before putting us 
into cold storage until it was time to 
go. I need a serious answer to a 
serious question.” 

“And I gave you a serious an- 
swer,” the Brother replied. “But 
what you really need, perhaps, is to 
know if you are just a little bit above 
normal, or someone who is a shade 
more average than the others. Well, 
the trip requires two people aboard 
to observe, make a few simple de- 
cisions and— very occasionally if at 
all— to perform simple actions. For 
this reason,” he added sardonically, 
“we have chosen carefully from our 
average travelers two who will act as 
the ship’s crew.” 

“But why the average people?” 
Devlin burst out. “What is it that 
you’re afraid of? Surely, for the 
success of the project, you need an 
above-average crew, at least? Even in 
these degenerate days there must be 
a few stable, highly intelligent and 
dedicated supermen—” 



“Like me?” 

“If this is something I shouldn’t 
know about say so,” said Devlin 
angrily. “Don’t bother to make 
jokes.” 

The couch sighed as Brother 
Howard raised himself to his elbows. 
He said, “I am too tired and there is 
too little time left for me to waste it 
in making jokes. You would like to 
know why we seem so abnormally 
interested in normal people. Well, I 
must admit that there are a few 
pieces of information that must be 
concealed from you— for the present, 
that is— but this is not one of them. 
But before I try to answer I want 
you to think about the society we 
are currently living in and all too 
frequently dying in. Where would 
you go to find a superman under 
these conditions? This is assuming 
that supermen ever existed in the 
first place— not just overtrained, 
hyperconditioned and forcegrown 
human beings. Then ask yourself 
where do we, the human race, go 
from here?” 

This, thought Devlin impatiently, 
is the sort of question I have debated 
many, many times. Mostly he had 
argued on the side of the optimists, 
insisting that the combination of the 
arts and sciences— sensitivity joined 
with high technology— were bringing 
Earth’s culture to the brink of a new 
apd even greater Renaissance. The 
suffering of a comparative few indi- 
viduals and the excesses of others 
were only to be ej^pected, just as the 
first Renaissance had been marred by 



160 



GALAXY 




its plagues and famines and un- 
balanced distribution of wealth. 

H e developed the argument 
for the Brother, insisting that in 
spite of the fact that so many of the 
individuM and group activities were 
destructive, there had never in aU of 
recorded history been so much free- 
dom of expression, so much medical 
care, so much food and associated 
comforts available to the population 
as a whole. Construction of mass 
accommodation buildings, road 
systems and recreational areas— 
especially in cities with strong and 
psychologically well-trained security 
forces— was slowly but surely, he had 
thought, pulling ahead of the protest 
groups that were bent only on 
wrecking civilization for reasons they 
themselves could not adequately ex- 
plain. And there had always been 
danger to the individual in a growing 
vital culture— carnivourous beasts 
prowling around the village at night, 
robbers and assassins infesting the 
highways and cities and now pro- 
testers and Maxers and security 
forces... 

“You’re an oppy, then,” Brother 
Howard broke in. “You like it here?” 
DevUn shook his head. “You know 
I don’t. But I want to be optimistic, 
mostly because I don’t want to agree 
with the doomsters. When I think 
about the drugging and killing and 
senseless destruction of everything 
that has been or is being built, chaos 
and ultimate doom is all that I can 
honestly foresee. Yet the people who 



realize that we are headed for 
trouble— and who try to rise to the 
top where they can do something 
about it— are usually too old to sur- 
vive the affairs needed to get there. 
And the ones who do get to the top 
without fighting are the ones who do 
what the people at the bottom want 
them to— which is nothing, because 
the people at the bottom don’t know 
what they want. 

“Even so there must be a few who 
reach the top without losing their 
ideals, their sensitivity, their feeling 
of responsibility for the long-term 
welfare of the people below them,” 
Devlin went on. “These are the kind 
of people you should send to the 
stars. I know that I seem to be 
arguing myself out of a berth on the 
ship— and I don’t want to do that— 
but I don’t think that I’m really 
fitted for this job. I don’t know who 
is fitted or even—” 

“Nobody is really fitted for this 
job,” said the Brother dryly, “be- 
cause it is a brand new one. But you 
could be right. There are probably a 
few altruists and far-seeing types 
around, but they are much rarer than 
you realize. The majority of the 
people from the middle levels to the 
top, even within the starship project, 
are motivated by intelligent— some- 
times highly intelligent-self-interest. 
They do very valuable and necessary 
work, all of them, and very often 
display compassion and other noble 
qualities. But when you probe deeply 
enough you find that they want 
power over people, even if it is the 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



161 




power to do only good. That, nat- 
urally, is an absolute bar as far as I 
am concerned,” 

“But why?” asked Devlin. “Surely 
we need leaders where we’re going? 
And what about you. Brother? Why 
aren’t yow a suitable candidate?” 

“Because,” said the Brother, “my 
self-interest, intelligent or otherwise, 
impels me to stay at home and exert 
pressure.” He smiled wryly, held up 
one hand and pressed the index 
finger and thumb together until both 
nails were rimmed with white, then 
added: “You could say that 1 want 
to give someone, somewhere, the 
pip.” 

Devhn shut his mouth firmly so as 
not to express his anger verbally, but 
he could not clamp down on the 
expression on his face, 

“Before you accuse me of joking 
again,” the Brother went on, “or you 
run to a citizen neighbor to borrow 
his belt, let me tell you that I am 
giving you the sober truth even if it 
is, at times, couched in non-serious 
language. I am a completely unsuit- 
able candidate. Before I became a 
Brother I was the kind of person you 
think is needed for this project- 
highly trained, highly intelligent, 
emotionally stable and possessing all 
of the qualities you seem to think are 
desirable for the job. But then I had 
a revelation— a quasi-religious experi- 
ence, you might say— that made me a 
fanatic. As such I had time and 
energy for only one form of 
activity-” 

Once again he held up his tightly 



pressed thumb and index finger. 

B efore DEVLIN could reply a 
triple shock made the surgery 
walls creak. The emergency PA began 
calling for all block security per- 
sonnel, regardless of status, to evacu- 
ate tlie roof in preparation for a 
landing by city security forces. 

Obviously the protest was turning 
into a big one with— judging by the 
shocks to the block’s structure- 
limited mass-destruction weapons 
being brought into use. This was only 
the third time in a year that such a 
thing had happened in the city, but it 
could mean serious damage and per- 
haps destruction of the block’s shel- 
ters and protector forces and cause a 
large number of bystander casualties. 
Devlin sighed and tried not to think 
about it while he was waiting for the 
Brother to start making sense. 

“My view of the future is both 
oppy and doomster,” the Brother 
went on, raising his voice above tlie 
sound of the PA. “Earth’s present 
high level of science and culture and 
the vast majority— if not all— of the 
people who live on it will be gone 
within a century. And it could all fall 
apart within the next decade. To 
me— and remember that you had the 
same idea— Earth is like a large, over- 
ripe but not quite rotten fruit. 

“I arrived at this idea before my, 
well, revelation, when 1 was still a 
sane and well-integrated superman,” 
he went on without smiling. “The 
analogy is a reasonably good one. 
Initially the fruit is small and bitter 



162 



GALAXY 




and not at all pleasant. There is no 
subtlety of feeling in sucli a society, 
no freedom, little happiness for even 
the very few who grasp power be- 
cause of the violence that brings 
them down. But later the fruit begins 
to grow and ripen. Order is imposed 
on the earlier chaos. Laws and com- 
munity cooperation replace con- 
tinual war and give much more indi- 
vidual freedom, which in turn sends 
minds questing inward toward philos- 
ophy and outward into science. The 
fruit continues to ripen, becomes 
mature. No longer is anyone forced 
to labor mindlessly for two-thirds of 
his or her waking life. There is time 
to develop new and subtle tastes and 
forms of pleasant or painful activity. 
Everyone feels free to indulge in any 
pursuit he or she fancies, and to go 
to hell if that is what an individual 
wants to do. Many people unfortu- 
nately feel free to take the others to 
heU with them. So the fruit becomes 
overripe and the next stage is dissolu- 
tion and decay.” 

“So endeth the parable.” said Dev- 
hn patiently. 

“So beginneth the parable.” the 
Brother replied firmly, “because here 
the analogy breaks down. Our grow- 
ing ripening fruit is not free to 
expand indefinitely, you see. It is 
growing within a thick, strong skin 
which produces compression effects. 
Population pressure, diminishing agri- 
cultural society? Or should we send 
hardy, thrusting, aggressive seeds 
which will survive, spread rapidly and 
perhaps choke themselves to death as 



we are doing now— or be 

destroyed by someone because they 
have become an obnoxious form of 
weed? Many times we have asked 
ourselves these questions, trying to 
find a seedling whose composition 
best represented our race. 

“The more deeply we went into 
the questions the more frightened we 
became of making a mistake,” he 
went on, rubbing the back of his 
hand across a suddenly sweating fore- 
head. “In the end we succumbed to 
moral cowardice and decided, if you 
could call it a decision, to select for 
mediocrity... It can’t be my imagina- 
tion. What is happening to your 
cooling system?” 

“Probably the security force on 
the roof are drawing power from this 
area for their equipment,” Devlin 
replied, “The place won’t become 
unUvable, but you’ll feel more com- 
fortable without your blouse— that is, 
if your beliefs allow you to—” 

“Thank you, no problem,” said 
the Brother. While he was unfasten- 
ing his black garment he went on: 
“So you will find no citizens or 
ex-citizens traveling in the ship. 
There is nothing at aU special about 
the colonists, other than they are 
only moderately good, moderately 
intelligent, neither too idealistic nor 
too cynical, not too lazy or too 
energetic. They are— well, average. 

“You see, when we really began to 
look into the situation we found that 
the ordinary non-aggresave, non- 
violent, moderate and average people 
have always been with us and have 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



163 




always been in the majority. They 
have always been there— a great, inert 
mass of humanity who refused to 
make anything but the smallest 
change in their thinking and life- 
styles when our flashy supermen and 
world conquerors tried to change, for 
good or bad, their world. Through- 
out history they have been like a 
great mass of sheep, slowly evolv- 
ing— sometimes because of, some- 
times in spite of, the scientific and 
cultural predators in their midst. 
They have grown slowly but they 
have survived as a type even to the 
present day—” He broke off as he 
pulled the blouse over his head, 
folded it carefully and placed it on 
the floor. 

“—and that is why,” he added, 
“the meek wiU inherit the new 
Earth.” 

Devlin tried hard not to stare at 
the upper torso the Brother had 
revealed. The other was in his middle 
or late fifties, but the muscle tone 
was stiU good. However, the onset of 
the degenerative processes had 
caused the scars, which had been left 
by the removal of a large number of 
surgically implanted bio-sensors, to 
show clearly. Devlin had seen pic- 
tures of such scarring in the text- 
books but until now had never met, 
or ever expected to meet, such a 
case. He had not believed that stellar 
astronauts really existed. 

“If supermen are excluded.” he 
said, clearing his throat and trying 
not to stare at the ghostly scars, 
“surely the ordinary people must be 



given training to prepare them for— I 
mean, we could meet anything out 
there.” 

“What training could we possibly 
give to an average, normal individ- 
ual,” Brother Howard replied, “that 
would prepare him to meet the com- 
pletely unimaginable. No, training as 
you understand the term is out. It 
might cause our carefully selected 
average people to warp or break— and 
we can’t risk that. No, Doctor, the 
process does not involve training, but 
education...” 

S UDDENLY the picture and 
sound of the Brother began to 
dissolve as a change in the lighting 
beyond Devlin’s closed eyelids 
brought him back to present time. 
He opened his eyes to look at the 
cubicle display. 

GOOD NIGHT DEVLIN. 

The fear of what the next frigid 
sleep might bring came rushing back 
to him as he realized that the cold 
explosion was only seconds away. 
But there was still a large portion of 
his mind that remembered only the 
feeling of awe at having made con- 
tact with a stellar astronaut who, it 
had been rumored, had been among 
the first to test hibernation anaes- 
thesia in space conditions— and the 
Brother’s enigmatic closing remark 
before he, too, had wished Devlin 
good night. 

“...before you can understand the 
people you may meet you must first 
fully understand yourself.”

T he most important event in the 
life of Oliver Murex was his 
finding of a seashell when he was 
four years old. It was a bright and 
shining shell that the dull little boy 
found. It was bigger than his own 
head (and little Oliver had an un- 
usually large head), and had two eyes 
peering out of its mantle cavity that 
were brighter and more intelligent- 
seeming than Oliver’s own. Both 
Oliver and the shell had these deep, 
black, shiny eyes that were either 
mockingly lively or completely 
dead— with such shiny, black things it 
was hard to say which. 

That big shell was surely the 
brightest thing on that sunny morn- 
ing beach and no one could have 
missed it. But George, Hector, 
August, Mary, Catherine and Helen 
had all of them missed it and they 
were older and sharper-eyed than was 
Oliver. They had been looking for 
bright shells, going in a close skirmish 
line over that sand and little Oliver 
had been trailing them with absent 
mind and absent eyes. 

“Why do you pick up all the dumb 
little ones and leave the good big 



165 




one?” he yiped from their rear. They 
turned and saw the shell and they 
were stunned. It actually was 
stunning in appearance— why hadn’t 
they seen it? (It had first to be seen 
by one in total sympathy with it. 
Then it could be seen by any su- 
perior person.) 

“I wouldn’t have seen it either if it 
hadn’t whistled at me,” Oliver said. 

“It’s a Hebrew Volute,” George 
cried out, “and they’re not even 
found in this part of the world.” 

“It isn’t. It’s a Music Volute,” 
Mary contradicted. 

“I think that it’s a Neptune Vo- 
lute,” Hector hazarded. 

“I wish I could say that it’s a 
Helen Volute,” Helen said, “but it 
isn’t. It’s not a Volute at all. It’s a 
Cone, an Alphabet Cone.” 

Now these were the shelliest kids 
along the seashore that summer and 
they should all have known a Volute 
from a Cone, all except little OUver. 
How could there be such wide differ- 
ences among them? 

“Helen is right about its being a 
Cone,” August said. “But it isn’t an 
Alphabet Cone. It’s a Barthelemy 
Cone, a big one.” 

“It’s a Prince Cone,” Catherine 
said simply. But they were aU wrong. 
It was a deadly Geography Cone, 
even though it was three times too 
big to be one. How could such 
sharp-eyed children not recognize 
such an almost legendary prize? 

• 

O LIVER kept this cone shell with 
him aU the years of his growing 



up. He listened often to the distant 
sounding in it, as people have always 
listened to seashells. No cone, how- 
ever, is a real ocean-roarer of a shell. 
They haven’t the far crash; they 
haven’t the boom. They just are not 
shaped for it, not like a Conch, not 
like a Vase Shell, not like a Scallop, 
not even like the common Cowries or 
Clam Shells or Helmet Shells. Cones 
make rather intermittent, sharp 
sounds, not really distant. They tick 
rather than roar. 

“Other shells roar their messages 
from way off,” Helen said once. 
“Cones telegraph theirs.” And the 
cUcking, ticking of Cones does sound 
somewhat like the chatter of a tele- 
graph. 

Some small boys have toy pandas 
or bears. But OUver Murex had this 
big seashell for his friend and toy 
and security. He slept with it— he 
carried it with him always. He de- 
pended on it. If he was asked a 
question he would first hold the big 
cone shell to his ear and listen— then 
he would answer the question intelli- 
gently. But if for any reason he did 
not have his shell near at hand he 
seemed incapable of an intelligent 
answer on any subject. 

There would sometimes be a 
splatter of small blotches or dusty 
motes on the floor or table near the 
shell. 

“Oh, let me clean those whatever- 
they-ares away,” mother Murex said 
once when she was nozzling around 
with the cleaner. 

“No, no— leave them alone— they’ll 



166 



GALAXY 




go back in,” Oliver protested. “They 
just came out to get a little s.unlight.” 
And the httle blotches, dust motes, 
fuzz, stains, whatever retreated into 
the shell of the big cone. 

“Why, tliey’re ahve!” the mother 
exclaimed. 

“Isn’t everybody?” Oliver asked. 

“It is an Alphabet Cone just as 1 
always said it was,” Helen declared. 
“And those little skittering things are 
the letters of the different alphabets 
that fall off the outside of the shell. 
The cone has to swallow them again 
each time, and when it has digested 
them they will come through to the 
outside again where they can be seen 
in their patterns.” 

Helen still believed this was an 
Alphabet Cone. It wasn’t. It was a 
deadly Geography Cone. Tlie little 
blotches that seemed to fall off it or 
to come out of it and run around— 
and that then had to be swallowed 
again— may have been little conti- 
nents or seas coming from the Geog- 
raphy Cone; they may have been 
quite a number of different things. 
But if they were alphabets (well, 
they were those, among other 
things), then they were more highly 
complex alphabets than Helen sus- 
pected. 

It isn’t necessary that all children 
in a family be smart. Six smart ones 
out of seven isn’t bad. Tlie family 
could afford big-headed, queer-eyed 
Oliver, even if he seemed a bit 
retarded. He could get by most of 
the time. If he had his shell with him, 
he could get by all the time. 



One year in grade school, though, 
they forbade him the company of his 
shell. And he failed every course 
abysmally . 

“I see Oliver’s problem as a lack of 
intelligence,” his teacher told father 
Murex. “And lack of intelligence is 
usually found in the mind.” 

“I didn’t expect it to be found in 
his feet,” Oliver’s father said. But he 
did get a psychologist in to go over 
his slow son from head to foot. 

“He’s a bit different from a 
schizo,” the psychologist said when 
he had finished the examination. 
“What he has is two concentric per- 
sonahties. We call them the core 
personality and the mantle person- 
ality— and there is a separation be- 
tween them. The mantle or outer 
personahty is dull in Oliver’s case. 
The core personahty is bright 
enough, but it is able to contact the 
outer world only by means of some 
separate object. I believe that the 
unconscious of Oliver is now located 
in this object and liis inteUigence is 
tied to it. That seasheU there, now, is 
quite well balanced mentally. It’s too 
bad that it isn’t a boy. Do you have 
any idea what object it is that Oliver 
is so attached to?” 

“It’s that seashell there. He’s had 
it quite a while. Should I get rid of 
it?” 

“That’s up to you. Many fathers 
would say yes in such case; almost as 
many would say no. If you get rid of 
the sheU the boy will die. But then 
the problem wih be solved— you’ll no 
longer have a problem child.”

Mr. Murex sighed, and he thought 
about it. He had decisions to make 
all day long and he disliked having to 
make them in the evening, too. 

“I guess the answer is no,” he 
finally said. “I’ll keep the seashell 
and rU also keep the boy. They’re 
both good conversation pieces. No- 
body else has anything that looks 
like either of them.” 

Really they had come to look 
alike, Oliver and his shell, both big- 
headed and bug-eyed and both of 
them had a quiet and listening air 
about them. 

Oliver did quite well in school 
after they let him have the big 
seashell with him in class again. 



A MAN was visiting in the Murex 
. house one evening. This man 
was by hobby a conchologist or 
student of seashells. He talked about 
shells. He set out some little shells 
that he had carried wrapped in his 
pocket and explained them. Then he 
noticed Oliver’s big seashell and he 
almost ruptured a posterior adductor 
muscle. 

“It’s a Geography Cone!” he 
shrieked. “A giant one! And it’s 
aHve!” 

“I think it’s an Alphabet Cone,” 
Helen said. 

“i think it’s a Prince Cone,” 
Catherine said. 

“No, no, it’s a Geography Cone 
and it’s alive!” 

“Oh, I’ve suspected for a long time 
that it was alive,” Papa Murex said. 



“But don’t you understand? It’s a 
giant specimen of the deadly Geog- 
raphy Cone.” 

“Yes, I think so. Nobody else has 
one,” father Murex said. 

“What do you keep it in?” the 
conchologist chattered. “What do 
you feed it?” 

“Oh, it has total freedom here, but 
it doesn’t move around very much. 
We don’t feed it anything at all. It 
belongs to my son Oliver. He puts it 
to his ear and listens to it often.” 

“Great galloping gastropods, man! 
It’s likely to take an ear clear off the 
boy.” 

“It never has.” 

‘ But it’s deadly poisonous. People 
have died of its sting.” 

“I don’t believe any one of our 
family ever has. I’U ask my wife. Oh, 
no, I needn’t. I’m sure none of my 
family has ever died of its sting. I just 
remembered that none of them has 
ever died at all.” 

The man with the hobby of conch- 
ology didn’t visit the Murex house 
very much after that. He was afraid 
of that big seashell. 

O NE day the school dentist gave a 
curious report of things going on 
in Oliver’s mouth. 

“Little crabs are eating the boy’s 
teeth— little microscopic crabs,” the 
dentist (he was a nervous man) told 
Mr. Murex. 

“I never heard of microscopic 
crabs,” Mr. Murex said. “Have you 
seen them, really, or examined them 
at aU?” 



168 



GALAXY 




“Oh, no, I haven’t seen them. How 
would I see them? But his teeth just 
look as if microscopic crabs had been 
eating them. Ah, I’m due for a 
vacation. I was going to leave next 
week.” 

“Are the teeth deteriorating fast?” 
Mr. Murex asked the dentist. 

“No, that’s what puzzles me,” the 
dentist said. “They’re not deterio- 
rating. The enamel is disappearing, 
eaten by small crabs. I’m sure of 
that; but it’s being replaced by some- 
thing else, by some sheU-like ma- 
terial.” 

“Oh, it’s aU right then,” Mr. Murex 
said. 

“I was going to leave on vacation 
next week. I’U call someone and tell 
them that I’m leaving right now,” the 
dentist said. 

The dentist left, and he never did 
return to his job or to his home. It 
was later heard of him that he had 
first abandoned dentistry and then 
life. 



B ut little Oliver grew up, or 
anyhow he grew out. He seemed 
to be mostly head, and his dwarfish 
body was not much more than an 
appendage. He and the great seashell 
came to look more and more like 
each other by the day. 

“I swear, sometimes I can’t teU 
which of you is Oliver,” Helen Murex 
said one day. She was more fond of 
Oliver and his shell than were any of 
their brothers or sisters. “Which of 
you is?” she asked. 



“I am.” 

Oliver Geography Cone grinned. 

1 am. 

Oliver Murex grinned. 

O LIVER MUREX was finally out 
of school and had taken his 
place in the family business. The 
Murex family was big in communica- 
tions, the biggest in the world, really. 
Oliver had an office just off the 
office of his father. Not much was 
expected of him. He seemed stiU to 
be a dull boy, but very often he gave 
almost instant answers to questions 
that no one else could answer in less 
than a week or more. Well, it was 
either Oliver or his shell who gave the 
almost instant answers. They had 
come to resemble each other in voice 
almost as much as in appearance and 
the father really didn’t care which of 
them answered— as long as the an- 
swers were quick and correct. And 
they were both. 

“OHver has a girl friend,” Helen 
teased one day. “She says she’s going 
to marry him.” 

“However would he get a girl 
friend?” brother Hector asked, 
puzzled. 

“Yes. How is it possible?” Mr. 
Murex wanted to know. 

“After all, we are very rich,” 
Helen reminded them. 

“Oh, I didn’t know that the 
younger generation had any interest 
in money,” Mr. Murex said. 

“And, after all, she is Brenda 
Frances,” Helen said. 



BY THE SEASHORE 



169 




“Oh, yes— I’ve noticed that she 
does have an interest in money,” Mr. 
Murex said. “Odd that such a re- 
cessive trait sliould crop out in a 
young lady of today.” 

Brenda Frances worked for the 
Murex firm. 

B renda Frances wanted 

round-headed OUver for the 
money that might attach to him, but 
she didn’t want a lot of gaff that 
seemed also to attach to the young 
fellow. But now Oliver became really 
awake for the first time in his life, 
stimulated by Brenda Frances’ ap- 
parent interest. He even waxed a 
little bit arty and poetic when he 
talked to her, mostly about his big 
seashell. 

“Do you know that he wasn’t 
native to the sea or shore where we 
found him,” Oliver said. “He tells me 
that he comes from the very far 
north, from the Sea of Moyle.” 
“Damn that bug-eyed seashell!” 
Brenda Frances complained. “He al- 
most looks ahve. 1 don’t mind being 
leered at by men, but I dislike being 
leered at by a seashell. I don’t believe 
that there is any such thing as the 
Sea of Moyle. I never heard of it. 
There isn’t any sea in the very far 
north except the Arctic Ocean.” 

“Oh, but he says that this is very 
very far north,” Oliver said with his 
ear to the shell {When you two put 
your heads together like that I don ’t 
know whose ear is listening to whose 
shell, Helen had said once), “very, 
very far north— and perhaps very 



again. It’s far, far beyond the Arctic 
Ocean.” 

“You can’t get any farther north 
than the Arctic,” Brenda Frances 
insisted. “It’s as far north as there is 
any north.” 

“No. He says that the Sea of 
Moyle is much farther,” Oliver re- 
peated the whispers and tickings of 
the shell. “1 think probably the Sea 
of Moyle is clear off-world.” 

“Oh great glabrous Glabula!” 
Brenda Frances swore. Things 
weren’t going well here. There was so 
much nonsense about Oliver as 
nearly to nullify die pleasant pros- 
pect of money. 

“Did you know that he has attend- 
ants?” Oliver asked. “Very small 
attendants.” 

“Uke fleas?” 

“Like crabs. They really are crabs, 
almost invisible, almost microscopic 
fiddler crabs. They are named Gela- 
simus Notarii or Annotating Crabs— I 
don’t know why. They Uve in his 
mouth and stomach most of the 
time, but they come out when 
they’re off duty. They do a lot of 
work for him. They do aU his paper 
work and they are very handy. I’ve 
been practicing with them for a long 
time, too, but 1 haven’t learned to 
employ them at aU well yet.” 

“Oh great whelping whelks!” 
Brenda Frances sputtered. 

“Did you know that the old 
Greeks shipped wine in cone shells?” 
Oliver asked. “They did it because 
cone shells are so much bigger on the 
inside than on the outside. They

would put half a dozen cone shells 
into an amphora of wine to temper 
them for it. Tlien they would take 
them out and pour one, two, or tliree 
amphoras of w'ine into each cone 
shell. The cones have so many inter- 
nal passages that there is no limit to 
their capacity. Tlie Greeks would 
load ships with the wine-filled cones 
and ship them all over the world. By 
using cones, they could ship three 
times as much wine as otherwise in 
the same ship.” 

“Wino seashells, that’s what we 
really need,” Brenda Frances 
mumbled insincerely. 

“I’ll ask him,” Oliver said. Tliey 
put their two heads together, Oliver 
and the cone shell. “He says that 
cones hardly ever become winos,” 



Oliver announced then. “He says that 
they can take it or leave it alone.” 

“After we are married you will 
have to stop this silly talk,” Brenda 
Frances said. “Where do you get it 
anyhow?” 

“From Shell. I’ll tell you some- 
thing else. The Greek friezes and low 
reUefs that some students of shells 
study— they are natural and not 
carved. And they aren’t really Greek 
tilings. They’re pictures of some off- 
world things that look kind of Greek. 
They’re not even pictures of people. 
They’re pictures of some kind of 
seaweed from the Sea of Moyle that 
looks like Earth people. I hope that 
clears up that mystery.” 

“Oliver, I have plans for us,” 
Brenda Frances said firmly, “and the 



BY THE SEASHORE 



171 



plans seem very hard to put across to 
you in words. I have always believed 
that a half-hour’s intimacy is worth 
more than forever’s talk. Come along 
now. We’re alone except for old 
sea-slob there.” 

“I’d better ask my mother first,” 
Ohver said. “It seems that there is 
some question about this intimacy 
bit, a question that they all believed 
would never arise in my case. I’d 
better ask her.” 

“Your mother is visiting her sister 
at Peach Beach,” Brenda Frances 
said. “Your father is fishing at Cat 
Island. George and Hector and 
August are all off on sales trips. Mary 
and Catherine and Helen are all 
making pohtical appearances some- 
where. This is the first time they’ve 
all been out of town at once. I came 
to you so you wouldn’t be lone- 
some.” 

“I’m never lonesome with Shell. 
You think the intimacy thing will be 
all right, then?” 

“I sure do doubt it, but it’s worth 
a try,” Brenda Frances said. “For 
me, you’re the likeliest jackpot in 
town. Where else would I find such a 
soft head with so much money at- 
tached?” 

“We read a seduction scene in a 
book once,” Oliver said. “It was kind 
of funny and kind of fun.” 

“Who’s we?” 

“Shell and myself.” 

“After we’re married, we’re sure 
going to change that ‘we’ stuff,” 
Brenda Frances said. “But how does 
Shell read?” 



“With his eyes like everyone else. 
And the annotating crabs correlate 
the reading for him. He says that 
seduction scenes are more fun where 
he comes from. All the seductors 
gather at the first high tide after the 
big moon is full. The fellows are on 
one side of the tidal basin— and then 
their leader whistles and they put 
their milt in the tidewater. And the 
she seashells (Earth usage— they don’t 
call themselves that there), who are 
on the other side of the tidal basin, 
put their roe into the water. Then 
the she seashell leader whistles 
an answer and that is the seduction. 
It’s better when both moons are still 
in the sky. At the Sea of Moyle they 
have two moons.” 

“Come along, Oliver,” Brenda 
Frances said, “and you can whistle if 
you want to, but that sea wash talk 
has got to stop.” She took big- 
headed, short-legged Oliver under her 
arm and went with him to the 
chamber she had selected as the 
seduction room. And Shell followed 
along. 

“How does it walk without any 
legs?” Brenda Frances asked. 

“He doesn’t walk. He just moves. 
I’m getting so I can move that way 
too.” 

“It’s not going to get into bed 
with us, Oliver?” 

“Yes, but he says he’U just watch 
the first time. You don’t send him at 
all.” 

“Oh, all right. But I tell you, 
there’s going to be some changes 
around here after we’re married.”

She turned out the lights when she 
was ready. But they hadn’t been in 
the dark for five seconds when 
Brenda Frances began to complain. 

“Why is the bed so slimy aU at 
once?” 

“Shell likes it that way. It reminds 
him more of the ocean.” 

“Ouch! Great crawling crawdads— 
something is biting me! Are they 
bugs?” 

“No, no— they’re the little crabs,” 
Oliver told her. “But Shell says that 
they only bite people they don’t 
like.” 

“Wow, let me sweep them out of 
this bed.” 

“You can’t. They’re almost too 
little to see and they hang on. Be- 
sides, they have to be here.” 

“Why?” 

“They’re annotating crabs. They 
take notes.” 

Brenda Frances left the bed and 
the house in a baffled fury. “Best 
jackpot in town, hell!” she said. 
“There are other towns. Somewhere 
there’s another half-brained patsy in 
a monied family— one that won’t 
bring the whole damned ocean to 
bed with him.” 

It was later learned that Brenda 
Frances left town in the same fury. 

“That was an even less satisfying 
seduction scene than in that book,” 
Shell and his crabby minions con- 
veyed. “We do these things so much 
better on the Sea of Moyle.” 

So Oliver preserved his virtue. 
After aU, he was meant for other 
things. 



A n OFF-WORLD person of an- 
L other great and rich family in 
the communications field came to 
call on Mr. Murex at his home. 

“We weren’t expecting your arrival 
in quite such manner,” Mr. Murex 
said. He had no idea of how the 
other had arrived— he simply was 
there. 

“Oh, 1 didn’t want to wait for a 
vehicle. They’re too slow. I conveyed 
myself,” the visitor said. They met as 
tycoon to tycoon. Mr. Murex was 
very anxious that he and his family 
should make a good impression on 
their distinguished visitor. He even 
thought about concealing Oliver, but 
that would have been a mistake. 

“That is a fine specimen,” the 
visiting person said. “Fine. He could 
almost be from back home.” 

“He is my son Oliver,” said Mr. 
Murex, quite pleased. 

“And his friend there,” the visitor 
continued, “1 swear that he is from 
back home.” 

“There’s a misunderstanding,” Mr. 
Murex said. “The other one there is a 
seashell.” 

“What is a seashell?” the visitor 
asked. “Are Earth seas hatched out 
of shells? How odd. But you are 
mistaken, person Murex. That is a 
specimen from back home. Do you 
have the papers on him?” 

“I don’t know of any papers. 
What would such papers indicate?” 
“Oh, that you have given fair 
exchange for the specimen. We 
wouldn’t want an interworld conflict 
over such a small matter, would we?” 



BY THE SEASHORE 



173 




“If you will let me know what this 
‘fair exchange’ is—” Mr. Murex tried 
to comply. 

“Oh, I’ll let you know at the time 
of my leaving,” the visiting tycoon 
said. “We’ll settle on sometliing.” 
This person was very much up on 
communications. He engaged Mr. 
Murex and George, Mary, Hector, 
Catherine, August, Helen, yes and 
Ohver, all in simultaneous conversa- 
tions on the subject. And he made 
simultaneous deals so rapid-fire as to 
astound aU of them. He controlled 
even more patents than did the 
Murex family, some of them over- 
lapping. The two tycoons were 
making non-conflict territory agree- 
ments and the visitor was out- 
shuffling the whole Murex clan by a 
little bit in these complex arrange- 
ments. 

“Oh, just let me clean them off 
there!” Mrs. Murex said once where 
she saw a splatter of small blotches 
and dust motes on the table that 
served both for conference and 
dinner table— the splatter of little 
things was mostly about the visitor. 

“No, no, leave them,” that person 
said. “I enjoy their conversation. 
Really, they could almost be Notarii 
from my own world.” Things began 
then to go well in these transactions 
even for the Murex family, just when 
they had seemed to be going poorly. 

The visitor was handsome in an 
off-worldly way. He was toothless, 
but his boney upper and lower beak 
cut through everything, through the 
prime steak that seemed too tough to 



the Murex clan, through the bones, 
through the plates. “Glazed, baked 
clay, we use it too. It spices a meal,” 
the visitor said of the plates as he 
munched them. “And you have de- 
signs and colors on the pieces. We do 
that sometimes with cookies.” 

“They are priceless chinaware,” 
Mrs. Murex said in a voice that was 
almost a complaint. 

“Yes, priceless, deUcious, ex- 
quisite,” the visitor said. “Now shall 
we finalize the contracts and agree- 
ments?” 

Several waiting stenographers 
came in with their machines. Brenda 
Frances was not among them— she 
had left the Murex firm and left 
town. The stenographers began to 
take down the contracts and agree- 
ments on their dactyl-tactiles. 

“And rU just save time and trans- 
lation by giving the whole business in 
my own language to this stenog- 
rapher from my own world,” the 
visiting tycoon said. 

“Ah, that isn’t a stenographer 
there, however much it may remind 
you of the stenographers where you 
come from.” Mr. Murex tried to set a 
matter straight again. “That is what 
we call a seashell.” 

But the visiting tycoon spoke in 
his own language to Shell. And Shell 
whistled. Then whole blotches and 
clouds of the almost invisible anno- 
tating crabs rushed into Shell, ready 
to work. The visiting tycoon spoke 
rapidly in off-worldly language, his 
beak almost touching Shell. 

“Ah, the Geography Cone shell- 



174 



GALAXY 




that’s what that thing is— is said to be 
absolutely deadly/’ Mf. Murex tried 
to warn the visitor. 

“They only kill people they don’t 
Uke,” the visitor said and he went on 
with his business. 

The annotating crabs did the paper 
work well. Completed contracts and 
agreements began to roll out of the 
mantle cavity of Shell. And all the 
business was finished in one happy 
glow. 

“That is it,” the visiting tycoon 
said with complete satisfaction after 
all the papers were mutually signed. 
With his beak he bit a very small 
ritual wedge from the cheek of his 
hostess, Mrs. Murex. That was a 
parting custom where he came from. 

“And now ‘fair exchange’ for the 
specimen from back home,” he said. 
“I always find these exchanges satis- 
fying and fruitful.” 

He had a sack. And he put the 
short-legged, big-headed Oliver into 
that sack. 

“Oh, that’s not fair exchange,” 
Mr. Murex protested. “I know he 
looks a little unusual, but that is my 
son Oliver.” 

“He’s fair enough exchange,” the 
visitor said. He didn’t wait for a 
vehicle. They were too slow. He 
conveyed himself. And he and OHver 
were gone. 

S O ALL that the Murex family 
had to remind them of their 
vanished son and brother was that 
big seashell, the Geography Cone. 
Was it really from the world of the 



visitor? Who knows the true geog- 
raphy of the Geography Cone? 

O LIVER sat on the shore of the 
Sea of Moyle in the far, far 
north. This was not in the cold, far 
north. It was on a warm and sunny 
beach in the off-world far north. And 
Oliver sat there as if he belonged. 

There hadn’t been any sudden 
space-change in OUver. There had 
been only the slow change through 
aU the years of his life and that was 
never a great alteration— a great dif- 
ference hadn’t been needed in him. 

Oliver was bright and shining, the 
brightest thing on that sunny morn- 
ing beach. He had his big head and 
his little body. He had two shiny 
black eyes peering out of his mantle 
cavity. Oliver was very much a sea 
shell now, a special and prized shell. 
(They didn’t use that term there, 
though. Seashell? Was the Sea of 
Moyle hatched out of a shell?) 

Six sharp-eyed children of the 
dominant local species were going in 
close skirmish right over that sunny 
sand and a smaller seventh child 
trailed them with absent mind and 
absent eyes. The big moon had al- 
ready gone down; the little moon 
stiU hung low in the sky hke a silver 
coin. And the sun was an over- 
powering gold. 

The sharp-eyed children were 
looking for bright shore specimens 
and they were finding them, too. 
And right ahead of them was that 
almost legendary prize, a rare Oliver 
Cone. ★

Choose any 4 books, even these science fiction greats: THE HUGO 
WINNERS, Volume I & II — 23 gripping short stories. A giant, handsome 
864-page record of greatness. DUNE by Frank Herbert. Perhaps one of 
the most important views of tomorrow ever written. Winner of both the 
famous Hugo and Nebula awards. THE GODS THEMSELVES — Isaac 
Asimov’s first novel in 15 years, an event well worth waiting for. 



What a way to get acquainted. Browse through the list of books on this 
page and choose any 4 for just 100. 



It's the most extraordinary sample of science fiction ever offered in 
one package. 



Here’s how the Club works: 



When your application for membership is accepted, you’ll 
receive your choice of 4 books for just 100 (plus shipping and 
handling). If not absolutely fascinated, return them within ten 
days — membership will be cancelled and you’ll owe nothing. 



About every 4 weeks (14 times a year), we’ll send you the 
Club’s bulletin describing the 2 coming Selections and 
Alternate choices. If you want both Selections, you need do 
nothing; they’ll be shipped automatically. If you don’t want a 
Selection, or prefer an Alternate, or no book at all, just fill out 
the form always provided, and return it to us by the date 
specified. We try to allow you at least ten days for making your 
decision. If you don’t get the form in time to respond within 
10 days, and receive an unwanted selection, you may return it 
at our expense. 



As a member you need take only 4 Selections or Alternates during the coming 
year. You may resign any time thereafter, or continue membership. Most books cost 
only $1.49 plus shipping and handling. Occa- 
sionally, extra-value Selections are slightly 
higher. So join now. Send no money. But do 
mail the coupon today.
