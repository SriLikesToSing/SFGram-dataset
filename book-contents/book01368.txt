IT DOESN’T TAKE A GENIUS 



to figure out how much you hate miss- 
ing the best story of your favorite writer 
or the major part of a great novel. But 
we can’t compute a formula to stock 
every newsstand in the country with 
enough copies of our popular magazines 
to satisfy every reader. So we some- 
times miss you and you miss us — and 
that’s a double tragedy. 

BUT THERE’S AN ANSWER. 

It doesn’t take a genius to handle it, 
either. All it takes is a minute of your 
time, for which we want to repay you 
with a handsome saving over the news- 
stand price. Just fill in the coupon — 
or write the information on a piece of 
plain paper — and mail it to us. Then 
you’ll be sure instead of sorry.

Readers write — and wrong! 

Dear Editor, 

I >vay but a mere stripling when / 
began reading science fiction. / broke 
in with Amazing, Astounding, Doc 
Savage and The Shadow. 

I have been reading SF for over 
thirty-five years now. / consider my- 
self sufficiently proficient at this and 
decided to branch into writing sf. I 
have been writing the stuff for several 
years. / am probably the oldest of the 
‘‘new wave” or maybe the newest of 
the ”old wave” or something like that. 

At any rate, I was pleased at your 
statement a while ago in reference to 
unpublished writers. I have looked 
(unsuccessfully) for the issue that con- 
tained these remarks. But if memory 
serves me correctly, you reaffirmed 
your willingness and intention to con- 
tinue publishing us neophytes and that 
you would even improve upon the 
old ways. 

This was some time ago and I have 
seen no evidence of an improvement 
or a continuance of the old policy. 
Tell me and the other hungry, strug- 
gling young authors that succor is 
on the way; that you intend to rein- 
stitute the old ways. 

In general, I have enjoyed the mag- 
azines since you have assumed con- 
trol. Specifically, I envied the ability 
of Dannie Flachta to write a story 
like ”The Festival.” The writing and 
the artwork reinforced each other. A 



” symbiosis” like this is rare and I 
hope you don't spoil it by overuse of 
the device.

Pick up the current issue of Galaxy 
at your newsst-and— read Pihon Fall, 
by Michael Bishop. It’s a fine first 
story by a new writer. I have also 
bought Michael’s second story— look 
for it in a forthcoming issue of 
Worlds of Fantasy. The Winter issue 
of Worlds of Tomorrow, also now on 
the stands, features Love Story, Gary 
K. Wolfs first publication, and sched- 
uled for the following issue is Joey, 
by (Mrs.) F. A. Davis. 

“Firsts” are also scheduled for up- 
coming issues of If. 

Dear Sir: 

I am writing to express my disap- 
pointment in your choice of Goodbye 
Amanda Jean for the July’ issue of 
Galaxy. 

In the same issue, Heinlein deals 
with the sort of violence described in 
Miss Shore's story; Feiffer handles it 
in his play, "Little Murders.” If it can 
be dealt ^ with so effectively, why pub- 
lish a story which has nothing but its 
shock value to recommend it? 

Thank you for listening. 

Lois A . Lampson 

I thought Goodbye, Amanda Jean 
gave more than shock value. It struck 
m« as expressing, with the directness 
and clarity of a mathematical formu- 
la, some of the cannibalistic aspects 
of our society and mores.

I 

H igh on a frozen mountain a 
naked, hirsute aborigine 
stirred in his nest. The only name 
he knew was Kaia, a name given to 
him by his first mate; in her lan- 
guage it meant — The Male. His 
metabolic clock still showed resid- 
ual hibernation time remaining, 
but hunger called. 

Kaia's feedings had been scanty 
during the warm season, and now 
his winter sleep was being inter- 
rupted by protein starvation — 
acute amino-acid deficiency. En- 
zyme systems faltered, screamed 
and tried alternate pathways. Re- 
luctantly he left the dark warmth 
of his nest and crawled toward the 
pale glow of the cavemouth. Icy 
stones numbed his hands and 
knees. He fingered the translucent, 
white crust that sealed him in. It 
was still thick and hard. The snow 
line had not yet receded up the 
mountain. Outside he could only 
expect the white death. Shivering, 
he returned to his nest and 
wrapped a tattered cetacean hide 
around his bony shoulders. His 



metabolic furnace sputtered with- 
out fuel. The coldness of death 
crept into his fingers and toes. 

Desperate, he sorted through the 
debris at the bottom of his nest, 
sucking on long bones for the rusty 
grit in the tubular marrow cavities, 
chewing dry fruit pits for a few 
coarse, bland lignen fibers and lick- 
ing cold mussel shells for stringy 
tags. Nothing. The cold continued 
to close in. He didn’t need the fer- 
rous ions in the marrow dust and 
his efforts had produced little else. 
Finally his grinding molars cracked 
open a fruit pit releasing a meaty 
seed so bitter than it puckered his 
parotid. He spat out the shells and 
chewed the meat. The starch prom- 
ised to rekindle his furnace. Gath- 
ering a handful of pits he carried 
them into the light of the cave 
mouth and cracked them open with 
a stone — munching the seeds with 
swallows of snow. When the resin- 
ous, starchy mulch coated his 
rugae and quieted his hunger pangs, 
Kaia burrowed back under the 
hides and returned to his torpid 
state. 

F illy lived at the base of the 
mountain. Her organs covered 
the foothills and her green skin cov- 
ered her organs. She was a shaft- 
city, one of the cyber-conduit units 
of Earth Society. Her fifty thou- 
sand hive citizens depended on her 
sunlit skin for its calories and on 
the mountain’s snow cap for its 
meltwater. Filly did her best to see 



6 



IF 




that her dwellers thrived. And 
thrive they did, for their warm, 
soft bodies bulged the census quo- 
ta and overflowed into the Big ES 
— the Earth Society that coated 
the land masses of the planet with 
a labyrinth of shaftcities like Filly. 

T he axis tilted. Longer, warm- 
er days melted back the snow- 
cap and thawed Kaia’s niche. The 
crust dripped for a time, then 
sagged and fell into the cave ex- 
posing his nest to the welcome 
glare of sunlight. He stretched and 
sat up, squinting. After wrapping 
on leggings and loincloth he 
crawled cautiously outside where 
he stood in a wet cool breeze, sil- 
houetted against a bright gray and 
white mosaic of stone and snow. 
The sun warmed his hairy neck 
and shoulders. For a long, pensive 
moment he studied the horizon. 
Hunger gnawed. Only an occasion- 
al agromech moved, buglike, in a 
distant valley. No huntercrafts. 
Calories beckoned from below — 
the twinkling, green filigree of Fil- 
ly’s plankton towers. Kaia started 
down the crag. His ridged, hyper- 
keratotic palms and soles gripped 
the granular stone surely and low- 
ered him the several thousand 
vertical feet into a richer, warmer 
atmosphere. He avoided the ex- 
posed upper slopes of Filly’s skin 
and followed a splashing stream 
into a more sheltered valley where 
he crept into the forest of plank- 
ton towers. The trunklike conduits 



glowed with an inner light of 570 
nanometers which filtered green- 
ishly through carotenoids and 
phycobilins. They rose, arborizing 
freely, to form the sunlit tubule 
canopy high overhead. The noisy 
approach of a cumbersome agro- 
mech sent him scurrying deeper 
into the syntheforest. After it 
passed he headed for the herb 
gardens. 

Filly noticed clandestine move- 
ment on her skin. Footsteps itched. 
She moaned when Kaia opened a 
tubule and began to suck plankton. 
Before she could sphincter down 
the leak the rich amino acids of the 
zooplankton were fueling his starv- 
ing enzyme systems. Refreshed, 
he munched his way across rows 
of chickpea, soybean and thyme. 
Filly screamed when he pulled off 
a stalk of fennel. Her sorrow trav- 
eled down the 65-mile-long nerve 
fiber to Hunter Control. 

Sucker in my garden. Varmint 
on my skin . 

V AL sat at the console in Hunt- 
er Control. He was monitor on 
duty. He wore the neat, camou- 
flaged tunic with the Sagittarius 
emblem that marked him as one 
of the hunter caste. A thin, sallow 
youth, he had just recently polar- 
ized his gender and his body was 
slow to respond. He was still a 
“soft male.’’ When Filly’s buckeye 
sighting appeared on the screen 
Val glanced at the wall map. Two 
huntercraft were out on routine 



SONG OF KAIA

patrol. One suddenly changed 
course and headed for Filly’s quad- 
rant. 

“Foxhound Nine answering 
call,” said the craft. 

Val said, “It looks like the buck- 
eye of Filly’s mountain is back. 
He’s been sighted many times be- 
fore, but has always managed to 
disappear. You’d better put out a 
hunter when you get there even if 
the sensors run blank. Might as 
well try to find his hiding place. 
He’s a tricky one.” 

Foxhound readied the hunter. 
Hypnoconditioning was boostered, 
and the neck titrator pumped a 
priming dose of speed into his 
veins. Harness checked. Bow and 
arrows issued. 

K AIA, the aborigine, sat hidden 
in tall grain while he savored 
aromatic juices of fennel. The 
rich sharp flavors jolted his pristine 
taste buds and stirred up violent 
parasympathetic storms. Copious 
digestive juices flowed. Peristalsis 
gurgled. As soon as his abdomen 
protruded comfortably he became 
more selective, choosing only the 
most succulent morsels. He was 
standing in shoulder deep kale 
when he heard the drone of the 
approaching huntercraft. He im- 
mediately dropped to his knees and 
crawled off in a zigzag course. The 
huntercraft followed easily and 
passed directly over him. He 
looked up to see the flat-bottomed 
fuselage hovering over an open 



cabbage patch. Its optics focused 
right on him. Its belly opened and 
the fat, camouflaged hunter 
dropped out, swinging on a cable 
harness. Kaia saw the deadly long- 
bow. The hunter’s dark glasses 
gave his pasty face a skull-like 
appearance. Fear gripped the abo- 
rigine’s chest. He curled up and 
went cold. 

The hunter stumbled in the soft 
plants, clumsy feet crushing cal- 
ories. The harness released him. 
He blinked around at the unfamil- 
iar shapes. He had never been Out- 
side before. The helmet’s tinted 
goggles protected him from the 
wild colors and coveralls shielded 
against actinic radiations. This was 
sunlight, and his pigment-poor 
protoplasm could be quickly dam- 
aged. His detector indicated sev- 
eral heat sources -in the vicinity. 
Their size, shape and relative tem- 
perature could be calculated from 
the readout, but the hunter’s drug- 
fogged brain pushed him into a 
tracking frenzy. He nocked his 
arrow and blundered off through 
the vegetable tangle toward an in- 
frared point. A few moments later 
he was standing before Filly’s ex- 
haust louvers. Underfoot the plants 
had been browned and stunted by 
the city’s warm, fetid breath. His 
glasses clouded in the condensate. 
Gasping for breath he stumbled 
back and sat down. 

Foxhound IX watched Kaia’s 
image fade until it matched the 
surrounding vegetables.

IF 




“Our quarry has died,” reported 
the craft. 

Val had seen the buckeye fade, 
but he remained skeptical. “The 
hunter hasn’t yet had a shot at it.” 
Shock, fear or heart attack could 
have finished the buckeye but who 
could be sure? ‘‘Can’t you get that 
hunter back to examine the body?” 

“He’s in the tracking frenzy. I 
won’t be able to break into his 
fugue state until after he makes his 
kill. His titrator is set on seventy- 
two hours.” 

Val scowled through the 
communicator. “Well, you can’t 
put down another hunter or they’d 
probably end up hunting each 
other. Let the hunt continue. If 
that buckeye is alive he may come 
out of hiding.” 

Foxhound returned to routine 
patrol in the vast gardens of the 
flats. Val studied the screens for 
another hour before stretching out 
on his cot for the midshift rest. 

T welve hours later the hunt- 
er began to slow down. He 
was standing, blurry-eyed, on the 
bank above Filly’s effluent grating, 
watching the warm, uriniferous 
fluids swirl off into the canal sys- 
tem. A cloud of gnats hung in 
the vapors around his head. Dur- 
ing the night he had examined 
every heat source on Filly’s skin. 
All had been the city’s own 
appendages. Now the hunter dozed 
on his feet. A jolt of Speed was 
pumped into his jugular. His eyes 



opened wide but unfocused. His 
detector indicated a warm body 
moving along the bank of the 
canal. He nocked his arrow and 
crept off, tracking an early- 
morning agromech on its way to 
the fields. 

K AIA’S senses returned 
slowly. The long hours of si- 
lence had relaxed his hibernation 
reflex and his metabolism re- 
heated. He peered from the tall 
grain. An orange dawn. This was 
day two for the hunter. There was 
still danger. Kaia dashed into an 
orchard of sweet-thing trees and 
picked one of the tart juicy fruits. 
He listened. Filly’s gratings and 
louvers trembled. A distant agro- 
mech growled at some irritant in 
the soil. No hovercraft. 

Kaia began to run through the 
trees. He followed the orchard for 
several miles, leaving Filly’s skin 
and moving onto the neighboring 
city’s cultivated surface. He knew 
he must put as many miles as 
possible between himself and the 
hunter. For the next two days he 
would be tracked. He munched on 
the sweet-thing and trotted toward 
the canal. 

The first arrow kicked him in the 
right femur, pinning his loincloth 
to his upper thigh. The impact bent 
him over and threw him down onto 
the grassy bank. He saw the hunter 
approaching from below the bank. 
A second arrow was being set to 
the bowstring. Kaia tugged on the 



SONG OF KAIA

shaft. Bloody shreds of loincloth 
moved deep in the wound but the 
broad hunting barbs held firm in 
the quadriceps muscles. He 
stumbled to his feet and tried to 
run but the three-foot shaft 
vibrated and grated painfully 
against deep nerves and bone chips. 
The second arrow kicked him 
under the right shoulder blade. It 
thrust painlessly through the soft 
tissues of his right lung. He looked 
down and saw the wet, red barbs 
protruding oddly from the middle 
of his chest. Grass hit him in the 
face. 

Val went down to the garage to 
watch Foxhound IX come in. The 
faithful old machine nodded to him 
as it settled into its bay. Service 
robots stood by while Medi- 
attendants rushed up to check on 
the hunters. Three stretchers were 
carried out. 

“All three came back — a good 
hunt,” said Val. 

Foxhound answered, “Not too 
bad. Took a trophy near Filly’s 
mountain — a nice young buck.” 

Val watched the attendants work 
on the hunters. Two seemed strong 
enough, just dazed; probably just 
delayed effects of their Molecular 
Reward. The third was almost 
dead. They hooked him to life 
support and his face pinked up a 
little. 

“What’s his problem?” Val 
asked coldly. 

“Just exhaustion. He was the 
one who took the trophy. Was 




tracking for a bit over twenty-four 
hours. He’ll be fine in a few days,” 
said the attendant, watching the 
life-support console strapped to the 
hunter’s chest. 

The stretchers were carried off. 
Val crawled into Foxhound’s 
cabin. It was a mess. Rubbish and 
offal filled the corners. Stains 
marred the fittings. A trophy cube 
sat in the freeze-drier. He picked it 
up. 

“Might as well take this on back 
to Hunter Control till the 
attendants bring him around. Nice 
trophy. Did you see him take it?” 

“No,” said Foxhound. “But the 
carcass was stretched out on a 
canal bank when I picked up the 
hunter. Like I said before — a nice 
young buck. You’ll see him when 
you review the optic records. I’ve 
already given the coordinates to 
Sampler and the sweeper robot. 
Should have the site cleaned up 
later today.” 

Val nodded and carried the 
trophy back to his office. 



S AMPLER was busy on the 
shaft floor, elbowing his way 
around in the dense crowd, 
searching for a jumper. Steady 
streams of citizens flowed — some 
formed stationary queues before 
the sluggish dispensers. Feeling 
something irregular underfoot. 
Sampler shouted for more working 
space. 

“Back up numbdumbs,” he said 



and waved the needle-point 
aspirator gun menacingly. 

The crowd parted. What 
Sampler saw unnerved him a little. 
The pulped body of the jumper- 
suicide wore a retirement tunic. 
The bone displacement indicated a 
fall of between one hundred and 
three hundred feet. Half a day 
under the apathetic crowd had 
pressed out most of the body fluids. 
Sampler pulled the sensor cord out 
of his belt analyzer, shrugged and 
replaced it. Useless to test this one. 
He held up the gun and set the 
drum on brain. Then he pointed the 
needle at the crepitant skull and 
squeezed the trigger. The gun 
jumped and the first vial turned 
gray. Vial two, heart. Needle to 
chest. Jump. Red vial. Vial three, 
lungs. He moved quickly through 
the needle sampling until the eight 
vials were full. Several times the 
crowd closed in on him and he had 
to struggle to keep from being 
trampled. As he moved away 
upspiral he clicked out the full 
drum and reloaded his gun with 
empties. A bulky sweeper moved 
past him to suck up the jumper. 

Near the top of the spiral the 
sweeper caught up with him. Its 
bag bulged with a hundred pounds 
of remains. 

“Better empty yourself,” said 
Sampler. “You have a pickup 
Outside.” 

While the machine vomited 
down a digester chute Sampler 
rested against the spiral railing. 



12 



IF 




Below he saw the salt-and-pepper 
crowd. He and the sweeper moved 
on upspiral. 

In the garage of the shaftcap 
Sampler set his gun in the 
sweeper’s appendage and tested the 
remote controls on one of the 
garage wall units. Through the 
screen he saw with the sweeper’s 
optics and felt with the sweeper’s 
sensors. A few agromechs and 
repair robots gathered around — 
curious. 

“Any time you’re ready,” he 
said. 

The garage door opened and the 
soft-wheeled sweeper rolled out 
into the bright, sunlit garden with 
its variety of colors and bizarre 
vegetable shapes. 



II 

O BESE old Walter tiptoed into 
Hunter Control and lowered 
his heavy frame carefully into his 
seat. His console blinked at him 
and filled out a flimsy printout to 
bring him up to date. Ignoring it, 
he arranged the folds of his tunic 
over his expansive belly and 
reached under the seat for his sack 
of split bamboo. He lowered his 
weaving into a pot of warm water 
to soften it and sipped on his high 
calorie drink while he waited. Be- 
hind him Val snored on his cot. 

Unexpectedly the screen focused 
on the anxious face of Sampler in 
the garage. 



“Monitor on duty?” asked the 
face. 

Old Walter glanced at Val’s cot 
and whispered: “M.O.D. here. 
What is it?” 

The Sampler held up a red- 
brown arrow and a handful of 
purple, jelly-like clots and said, 
“The carcass is gone.” 

Walter pursed his fat lips and set 
down his weaving. Casually he 
picked up the flimsy to see what 
carcass they were talking about. 
Sampler continued to jump around 
nervously. Val sat up to hear the 
shaking report continue. 

“All the sweeper found were 
these two arrows and the clots. One 
arrow is broken. There was no sign 
of—” 

Val’s whining voice cut in: “Now 
what went wrong? Do I have to do 
everything myself?” He jumped off 
his cot and rushed angrily to his 
console. Walter shook his head 
slowly. Polarization of his gender 
had certainly made Val irritable. 

“Those are blood clots?” Val 
challenged. 

Sampler looked at the inch-thick 
gobs of purple-red jelly. They 
looked nothing like the watery pink 
stains around jumpers. 

Walter, who had finished the 
flimsy, answered Val. “Blood 
clots? Could be. Have him send a 
vial of the stuff down for analysis. 
You never know what you’ll find if 
you start examining these 
buckeyes. Any idea of what 
happened to the carctiss?”

Sampler shook his head. 

Val asked insultingly, “Are you 
sure you were in the right area?” 

“Had the optics of the kill to go 
by. Found the arrows and blood. 
Yes, Fm sure,” said Sampler. 

“Then I suppose he just got up 
and walked off — or something 
came out of the canal and ate 
him?” 

Val turned off his screen 
abruptly. 

Walter tried to smile at the 
Sampler. “Just send us a vial of 
clot — and — thanks a lot.” He 
signed off and adjusted his tentlike 
tunic. “Might as well go over those 
optic records ourselves, Val. 
Maybe the wounds weren’t so 
bad.” 

Later the tech came up from the 
lab with the trophy cube and vial. 
They all reviewed the optics of the 
kill. 

The tech said, “We’ve projected 
these wounds into our 3-D 
mannequins and they look fatal. 
The arrow in the chest entered off 
to the right. It crossed the hilum of 
the right lung where most of the big 
vessels are. Then it came out the 
sternum. Without immediate 
surgery he should bleed out 
quickly — in less than an hour 
probably. The torn lung would 
collapse also — suffocation. The 
thigh wound doesn’t seem to bleed 
much in the records. Probably 
missed the femoral artery. But it is 
a solid hit, and any attempt to pull 
out the barbs would result in 



significant soft-tissue damage. No, 
gentlemen. Your buckeye did not 
get up and walk away.” 

“I suppose that still leaves the 
meat-eaters. The cetaceans are 
supposed to be plant-eaters — but 
there is always the possibility of an 
aquatic buckeye. They’re known 
cannibals,” said old Walter. “Did 
you learn anything from the 
trophy?” 

The tech glanced at his printout. 
“Well the absence of Barr bodies 
and the presence of carotenoids fit 
with a buckeye male. Barr bodies 
indicate the female X chromosome 
and the carotenoids raw vegetable 
diet — you know. We were able to 
reconstitute some blood from the 
vessels in the trophy. Freeze-drying 
preserves it quite well. We kept it 
from clotting by oxalating off the 
calcium. The clotting times for the 
trophy serum were twice as fast as 
for our standard citizen. When we 
added calcium it clotted in a 
hundred and fifty seconds. You 
know that our normals are around 
four hundred seconds.” 

“The buckeye must have been 
very sick,” said Val. 

“Yes. His hemoglobin, as near 
as we can tell, was three times 
normal.” 

Walter picked up his wickerwork 
and watched the replay of the 
buckeye killing. Sinewy legs 
carried the victim closer at a 
smooth trot. Bright red blood 
flowed from the first wound. 
Walter studied the buckeye’s wild-

eyed, vigorous efforts to remove 
the arrow and run. 

“He doesn’t seem very weak,” 
Walter suggested. 

“No, he doesn’t,” admitted the 
tech. “But for these results to be 
anywhere near normal — he’d al- 
most have to be an entirely dif- 
ferent species.” 

“Well, isn’t he?” Val asked 
sharply. 

The tech smiled and began to 
quote from the ESbook: 
“ ‘Citizens have many biped 
ancestors in the evolutionary tree. 
The taxonomy of these fossil 
hominids is still controversial. 
Surface dwellers such as Homo 
leakeyi and Homo sapiens may not 
have been in the main stream of 
evolution, for their collective 
efforts were limited.’ ” 

“And the buckeyes?” asked Val. 
“Just living fossil hominids,” 
said the tech. “The species 
designation is hard to justify for a 
life form that is extinct.” 

“But they’re not extinct. We just 
killed one last night.” 

Walter smiled. “1 think what the 
tech means — and what the ESbook 
teaches — is that the buckeye has 
been effectively displaced. Like 
most of the other useless life 
forms on the planet, he has been 
crowded out by the more efficient 
Big ES. There may be a few ran- 
dom throwbacks occurring in 
those citizens who carry the defec- 
tive gene — but not in significant 
numbers. Certainly not enough to 



reproduce themselves effectively.” 

“Living fossils,” said Val. “Too 
bad we can’t spare calories and 
quarters for a zoo. I’d like to 
study one.” 

Walter returned to his weaving 
saying, “Impossible. From what I 
understand they need ten or twenty 
times the living quarters of a 
citizen. Anyway, they take badly to 
captivity. If you lock them up they 
die or escape.” 

Val and the tech looked at each 
other, puzzled. 

“Mind if I take the trophy back 
to the lab? There a few more 
comparisons I’d like to make,” 
said the tech. 

“Go ahead,” Val said absently. 



K AIA struggled up from his 
reflex hibernation. He had 
tried several times before, but the 
pains set off alarms that triggered 
the reflex and cooled him again. 
He remembered a glimpse of the 
longhaired coweye pressing wood- 
en pegs into his thigh wound to 
widen the wound and engage the 
barbs so that the arrow could be 
withdrawn. Her soft face and 
bright eyes lingered in his cooling 
memory molecules as he slept. 
She had snapped off the arrow 
head protruding from his sternum 
and had pulled out the shaft. She 
had also tended his other injuries, 
caused by the hunter’s trophy 
hunger. The wounds did not bleed. 
To carry his sinewy body into the

canal and float it — face up — sever- 
al miles to her little nest in the 
weedy bank had been simple. 

She bathed and dressed the 
wounds to lessen the pains and 
untrigger his hibernation. When he 
opened his eyes she forced broth 
into him — rich mussel meat and 
barley. He would need all his 
strength very quickly, for she was 
in her follicular phase. She needed 
a mate. For three weeks she fed 
him hot food and warmed him with 
her body at night — but he had not 
recovered enough to mate. During 
the fourth week she went luteal and 
left him. 

He ate grains and gained 
strength from the sun — always 
remaining below the silhouette of 
the bank. In two weeks she 
returned and it was hot food and 
warm nights again until her ovaries 
completed another cycle. They 
mated in their sixth week. She 
drove him out during the seventh. 

For several months Hunter 
Control was very quiet. Thousands 
of square miles of Orange Sector 
gardens flourished, were harvested 
and flourished again without a 
single buckeye sighting. An 
occasional pile of chewed and 
charred bones was reported along 
the canals. Huntercraft patroled 
and put out hunters on possible 
spoor — and found nothing. 

“You’d think with Jupiter in 
Sagittarius we’d have better 
hunting,’’ Val said in one of his 
rare light moments. 



Walter frowned. 

“Just joking,” Val said. 

After a few minutes of strained 
silence Walter relaxed and said, “1 
know. But it isn’t very funny. I’ve 
been here in Hunter Control ten 
years. Those buckeyes must watch 
the planets pretty closely. They 
seem to know crop and weather 
cycles better than we do. They 
literally sleep under the stars. If 
Jupiter in Sagittarius is good for 
the hunter it is obviously bad for 
the hunted. That may be exactly 
why we haven’t had any sightings. 
They’re in hiding.” 

“If that’s true we might as well 
put Hunter Control on standby and 
do something useful. Jupiter is 
going to be there for quite a while.” 
Hunter Control’s meek brain 
argued, “But astrology is not 
logical. Standby isn’t warranted.” 
“You’re just afraid of being 
lonely,” said Walter. “It doesn’t 
matter if it is illogical. If the 
buckeyes follow it and stay in 
hiding we might as well use the 
time to overhaul the huntercraft. 
You won’t be alone. Tinkers will be 
in the garage. You can even stay on 
full alert if you prefer.” 

“I prefer,” said the meek. 

“While your at it you might as 
well keep an eye on the lesser 
planets for a favorable aspect that 
might bring out the buckeyes. Then 
we might be able to get the jump on 
them.” 

At the end of the shift Walter 
returned to his family-5. He invited

Val with the usual: “We can always 
use an extra soul in the meld.” 

Val declined. 

“Thanks— but I’m going 
between walls on a rat hunt. I’ll 
save you some flavored calories if 
the catch is good.” 

They went their separate ways. 
Val had strong feelings about the 
meld. Rubbing souls with anyone 
irritated him. He clashed with 
polarized males and females and 
the neuters were just too bland to 
waste time with. 

Walter, on the other hand, 
enjoyed his family-5. He accepted 
ritual hugs from female Bitter and 
talked to Jo Jo and Busch about 
their jobs in the garage. Neutral 
Arthur painted murals on their 
walls and arranged family 
entertainment. 

V AL returned to his cubicle 
and took his rat-hunting gear 
out of his locker. The coveralls, 
soft shoes and heavy gloves were 
well worn. He had taken many ex- 
tra calories from the dark spaces 
between the city’s organs. He 
changed the filters in the dust mask 
and checked the power in the head 
lamp. Picking up the anoxic gas 
bag he started for the mid level of 
the spiral. 

Light from the access grating 
guided him for a while. The first 
thing he saw was a ring of four dry 
skeletons — “mushrooms” whose 
serotonin metabolism had been 
displaced by Molecular Reward. 



“Four mushrooms — level thirty- 
five,” he said into his wrist com- 
municator. 

The city answered: “Where?” 

Val tapped the flat beam with his 
foot. Solid. “A weight-bearing 
strut,” he said. “But they’ve 
skeletonized. Sampling isn’t 
indicated.” 

He moved on to other tubular 
and spherical structures. Some 
hollow and flexible. Others warm 
and pulsing with fluids. All were 
caked with thick, spongy dust 
which festooned like Spanish moss. 
Deep, snakelike trails ran through 
the dust. Rat droppings were 
everywhere. He flashed his light 
around. Beady eyes winked back. 

“Lots of rats down here. City.” 

“Many of my citizens are 
reincarnationists and don’t eat 
meat,” said the city. “You’ll find 
the nests under my membrane 
filters. You’re on the right level. 
Keep going.” 

He crawled under whistling air 
conduits and then stood. Using 
heavy cables for handholds, he 
walked across a narrow stiff pipe. 
He flashed his light down. The 
blackness seemed bottomless. Only 
ah occasional cobweb caught his 
beam. Ahead he saw one of the 
city’s organs — a sphere about 
thirty yards in diameter with a 
medusa head of flexibles. It was 
warm and dry. He pressed his head 
against it. Silence. 

“Found one of your energy 
organs,” he said. 



SONG OF KAIA

anatomy charts. “Membrane 
filters are ten degrees clockwise,” 
said the city. 

Val shined his light in that 
direction. Ten degrees was many 
yards this far out from shaft 
central. He moved across one of 
the larger tubes. It was hollow and 
he heard voices and movements 
inside — a crawlway. Adult rats 



became more numerous. The 
larger ones remained stubbornly in 
his path until he was practically 
stepping on them. He didn’t try to 
catch them. They weren’t too tasty 
and they could probably bite 
through his gloves. 

The sweet stink of the rat nests 
hit him before he saw the huge 
cool sphere of the membrane fil- 
ters. The sweat of the city con- 
densed on its outer walls and 
streaked down to water the nests 
in the struts below. The hum of the 
pumps tickled his feet as he ap- 
proached. 

He released the nitrogen into his 
bag as he thrust his gloved hand 
into the first nest. The soft young 
rats were probably expecting 
mother with food. They swarmed 
all over his hand and were easily 
removed and placed into the bag, 
where their squeaking ceased. He 
moved from nest to nest until his 
bag weighed almost half as much 
as he did. 

Kicking a large rat off his shoe, 
he asked the city where the nearest 
access hatch was. After a pause he 
was directed back along the 
crawlway. 

He dropped into the crawlway in 
a shower of sooty dust. His bag 
balanced on his shoulders, he 
tracked the black downspiral to 
Watcher’s quarters at shaft base, 
where he stopped to pay his tithe. 

“Nice hunting today,” he said. 

Watcher rubbed his hands 
together when he saw all the fresh 



19 



meat. He and Val warmed up the 
press and threw the bouncing little 
bodies inside. 

“Six hundred before press and 
three hundred after?” asked 
Watcher, setting the controls. 

“Fine with me,” said Val. He 
gestured toward the refresher. The 
Watcher nodded him inside. The 
air-water laminar flow cleaned his 
gear while he undressed. He took a 
clean issue tissue tunic from the 
wall dispenser. The sounds of 
frying and the smell of scorched fur 
filled the room while he dressed. 
The press fell with a loud thump 
that shook the room. Odors of a 
high protein bake brought out the 
Watcher’s family-7. 

“Calories for the meld tonight,” 
said Watcher clapping his hands 
and shooing the six young neuters 
back into the living quarters. 
“Flavored calories.” 

The press lifted and Val began 
scooping the brown and black 
wafers into his bag. They were still 
hot. He stopped and blew on his 
fingers. Watcher used a spatula to 
pile the share on a large platter. He 
carried it into his living quarters. 
Val heard the wet, smacking 
sounds of an evening meld/meal. 
Pressed rat was a delicacy. 

“Flavors are good for the soul,” 
mumbled Val as he started off 
toward Walter’s quarters. 



B itter met him at the door 
and immediately began to fon- 



dle the heavy bag of pressed rat. 
Val frowned her away. 

“Where’s Walter?” he asked. 

“Back here,” Walter shouted 
from his cubicle. Val glanced 
around the spacious thirty-foot 
living room. There was some 
advantage to a family-5. Space 
was pooled. But your personal 
cubicle was that much smaller. He 
walked back to Walter’s ten-foot 
room. 

“You’re a Dabber?” Val 
exclaimed. 

Walter smiled. “Dirt-Adobe- 
Bamboo. Yes, 1 guess I am. Come 
in. Have a seat.” 

The cot and chair were woven 
bamboo. Dirt covered most of the 
floor — not greasy, black soot from 
the city’s air vents but red-brown 
clay. Soil. Adobe bricks were 
stacked halfway up one wall like 
hoarded gold bars. Val sat 
carefully on the edge of the chair. 
It squeaked. 

“You’re just in time for the 
Changing Of The Dirt Ceremony,” 
Walter said. He went to a pot in the 
corner and lifted up a circular piece 
of crabgrass sod. The soil 
underneath smelled of humus, bugs 
and worms. “Purified dirt.” 

He swept up the old dry dirt 
from the floor and placed it on the 
ceremonial bamboo scoop. Then he 
dumped the pot of sticky black soil 
and spread it around reverently, 
picking up an occasional earth- 
worm or sowbug and dropping it 
back into the pot.. Then he poured 



20 



IF 




the old dry dirt from the scoop in- 
to the pot, added water and re- 
placed the circular piece of crab- 
grass sod. 

Val watched the fat old man 
walk barefoot in his personal mud 
pie. “You don’t actually believe all 
that Dabber nonsense, do you?” 
Walter smiled tolerantly. “It 
isn’t a matter of faith — it’s 
statistics. For the past four 
thousand years, as long as our 
records are accurate, Dirt-Adobe- 
and-Bamboo — otherwise DAB — 
has protected men’s minds. Inap- 
propriate Activity just doesn’t oc- 
cur among Dabbers.” 

Val held up his hand. “I know 
what’s inappropriate — biologically 
— but you crowd any species and 
they’ll start the killing of self, 
mate and offspring. It’s nature’s 
way of controlling a species that is 
too successful. The only time Man 
was safe from it was during the 
neolithic cultures when deaths 
came from a hostile environment.’’ 
Walter pulled a pair of sandals 
on his fat dusty feet. 

“It’s more than just nature’s 
selection of the fit. Our Dabber 
ranks are full of I.A. victims. If we 
can catch them early they’re 
salvageable. Some have made 
suicide gestures before we get 
them. We smear mud on them, 
dump dirt in their rooms and teach 
them the rituals with adobe and 
bamboo. Salvageable.” 
“Occupational therapy?” 
“Maybe. But we’re boasting a 



hundred percent protection against 
I.A. Do you know what the Psych 
Team’s cure rate is? Terrible.” 

“Statistics,” Val said. “I know 
Psych sends the I.A. to 
suspension — but the Dabber census 
is for fraternal not mortality 
purposes. Even your own 
diagnosed Inappropriate Activity 
victims are unofficial. The Psych 
Team never even got to them. 
Diagnosis? Statistics? Not 
comparable. But we can’t settle it 
tonight. Here.” Val reached into 
his heavy sack of protein wafers 
and offered a handful to Walter. 
“It was a good hunt. Brought you 
some flavored calories.” 

Walter popped one into his 
mouth and chewed carefully 
around the stiff meshwork of 
bones, skin and tail. The rich 
variety of flavors pleased 
him — strong charred keratin of 
cutaneous structures, salty fluids, 
tangy viscera anji the iron-rich 
rusty flavors of muscle and blood. 
He spat the residue into his palm 
and placed it under the crabgrass. 

“A treat for my little friends in 
the soil.” 

Bitter stuck her head in the 
doorway: “Meld time.” She 
glowed. She had soaked in hot 
water until even her fingernails had 
softened. Her tunic folds hung 
loosely. 

Walter nodded, shaking his three 
chins. “Join us?” he asked Val. 

“No. I’ve got to get home and 
fix my — ”

Walter put a pudgy hand on his 
arm, picked up the heavy bag with 
the other. “You’ll eat with us. 
We’ll sauce up these wafers — have 
a few drinks.” 

“But—” 

Bitter took her cue from her 
provider and put her arm through 
Val’s. “We even have a little extra 
Molecular Reward. You can see 
heaven tonight.” 

V AL was uncomfortably silent 
while they arranged themselves 
on the floor around platters and 
tall glasses. Bitter was busy at the 
dispenser. Two males, young Jo 
Jo and old coarse-mannered 
Busch, were studying small 
amounts of brightly colored liq- 
uids in their glasses. Neutral Ar- 
thur removed his tunic. When old 
Walter wheezed and struggled out 
of his pleated tent the sudden ex- 
posure of all that flesh was hard to 
ignore. Redundant folds of belly 
and Hank fat hung to his knees. He 
looked more ^ like an unfinished 
clay statue than a human. 

“You know, Walter, you should 
never take off your clothes.” 
“Relaxing is good for the soul, 
Val.” Walter plopped down to the 
floor. 

Setting cups of a soupy first- 
course on the platters, female 
Bitter also began to untie her tunic. 
Her figure was trim but her 
puberty-plus-nine years had added 
a horizontal belly wrinkle. Her 
breasts were quite small. “Do you 



think I should leave my clothes on, 
too?” she asked cloyingly. 

Val remained standing. Another 
insult might get him out of what 
could be an unpleasant evening. 
“I’m afraid I’ve seen better bodies 
on neuters,” he said. 

She gave him a ritual hug. 
“Neuters can’t get warm in the 
right places.” 

Val frowned. 

Walter smiled and picked up his 
tunic. “If our guest feels more 
comfortable dressed — ” he said 
pulling on the flowing garment. 
“We can have a nice, first-stage, 
hand-holding meld.” 

They held hands, talked and ate. 
The drinks were warm and 
intoxicating. When Bitter produced 
the Molecular Reward Val shook 
his head. 

“Don’t you want to see heaven?” 
she asked. 

“Not while my body is 
here — not till its time.” 

“Why?” Walter sounded 
sincerely interested. 

“I don’t know. Maybe it’s the 
mushroom reaction. I’ve seen too 
many. Maybe I just don’t want to 
see something unreal and be fooled 
into believing it is real.” 

“We’ll watch you. You can’t go 
mushroom here,” coaxed Bitter. 

Val shook his head. “No. I don’t 
think I’d like to experience 
molecular happiness and then wake 
up and find it was just a dream. 
The disappointment would be 
depressing.”

Bitter shrugged. Walter and 
Busch also shook their heads. 
Arthur said, “Maybe later. Right 
now 1 have to put on the evening’s 
entertainment. It’s a dance. I need 
you, Bitter, for a partner— so you 
shouldn’t take it either.’’ 

Jo Jo hadn’t said much all even- 
ing. He took the M.R. and retired 
to a corner with his visions. 

Walter studied Val for a min- 
ute, then asked, “You aren’t 
afraid of M.R. are you? We give 
it to Hunters every day. It is one 
of the pet rewards of the Big ES.’’ 
“Maybe Hunters need it. I’ve 
seen some pretty badly chewed up 
legs after three days of the tracking 
frenzies. The pain must be all but 
unbearable. M.R. could help that. 
But I worry about ordinary citizens 
taking it. The Big ES makes it easy 
for the retired to get it — maybe 
they need it too. I don’t know, but 
you don’t see many of the really old 
retireds around. I don’t think it 
helps them any.’’ 

“Can’t prolong life. Nothing 
can,’’ Walter said philosophically. 
“Well, now. I see Arthur and Bitter 
are ready for their dance.’’ 

The music Arthur selected was 
loud. It irritated Val. The dispenser 
screen flowed with dancing figures. 
Arthur and Bitter watched a while 
and then tried to copy the 
movements. Val was sure they were 
missing the rhythm completely but 
he sat smiling with the others. Soon 
Busch fell asleep and the meld 
broke up at bedtime. 



T he next morning Busch grum- 
bled his way to the breakfast 
table. Bitter gave him a ritual hug. 
“Missed your warmth in the meld 
last night,’’ she said. 

He nodded toward the dispenser 
for his usual calorie basic. She 
warmed the refresher for him and 
went to the dispenser to arrange his 
platter. 

“Your new issue tissue is on the 
hook,’’ she called pleasantly as he 
came out of the refresher. He 
dressed silently. Old Walter 
waddled out in his dusty tunic and 
sat down. Bitter fluttered around 
her two job-holding men, 
wheedling extra flavors out of 
them. Soon she had enough for her 
own breakfast. She sat down to eat 
just as Busch stood up to leave. 

“Isn’t Jo Jo giving you any 
flavors these days?” he asked. 

Bitter shook her head. “Jo Jo 
has been cold in the meld for a long 
time now.” 

“Try being more generous with 
your nonritual hugs.” 

“I’ve done my best.” Bitter 
chewed on a sticky fructose ball. 
“But he holds out — must be saving 
for a bud child or something. I just 
checked his cot. He’s already up 
and gone.” 

Walter leaned into the 
conversation but was interrupted 
by a fading scream. Busch leaped 
from his chair and crawled quickly 
to the spiral. Looking down, he

saw ripples in the crowd around 
the broken body of a jumper. He 
identified Jo Jo’s tunic before the 
speckled crowd flowed back. He 
returned to Walter and Bitter, 
announcing jubilantly that Jo Jo 
was giving a party. 

“Now? Right after we ate?” 

“Now,” Busch said to the 
dispenser. He ordered the 
expensive, high-flavor items as fast 
as he could and placed them on 
platters as they were delivered. 
Then a sensor at shaft base 
recorded cessation of Jo Jo’s 
cortical activity and the dispenser 
abruptly closed its chute. 

“Jo Jo has died. His calorie 
credits have gone to the General 
Account,” it explained. 

“You knew?” Walter gasped, 
staring at the pilferings. 

“Of course. I just wish that the 
crowd had had the decency not to 
trample him so quickly. He landed 
well, horizontal; no femurs in his 
belly. Small splatter. He should 
have lived a couple hours longer.” 

“Robbing the dead,” Walter 
said. 

Bitter sorted through the items 
for stables she could use in 
bartering. “What kind of love is it 
when you take your calories with 
you? We’re his family. If he wanted 
to go — the least he could do is 
throw a party first.” 

“I could use a couple more 
pounds of flavored protein,” said 
Busch. 

Walter sighed. “Now we’re 



widdled down to a family-four. Jo 
Jo was a worker too. I’ll be retir- 
ing soon. I guess I’m as guilty as 
the rest of you — been counting on 
Jo Jo’s calories for my retirement 
years.” 

“Widdled?” asked neuter 
Arthur. “Well, one of us should go 
and see what Sampler learns from 
the remains. Next we’ll have to 
start screening for Jo Jo’s replace- 
ment. A family-four can’t hold on 
to living quarters this size.” 

Walter called Val to meet him at 
the Neuro lab and left. Bitter and 
Arthur waited for the first 
applicants to arrive. 

“Try to find one with a job,” 
said Busch as he started off for the 
garage. “A good job.” 




Val and Walter watched the scope. 
Jo Jo’s neurones began to flow by. 

The tech said, “We got this one 
sampled promptly. There should 
be ample brain cells with respira- 
tory quotients high enough for 
analysis. Those are red cells. This 
one is just a nuclear fragment.” 

A large triangular cell drifted 
into view. The tech closed the 
chamber and flooded it with 
oxygen and nutrients. 

“This looks like a promising 
one. I’ll wak for its R.Q. to get 
up in the normal range before 
we start. There are three neuro- 
chemicals in the brain. Most 
cells can use them all. Basically 



24 



IF 




they fit into the three different 
brain functions. Acetylcholine for 
sensory-motor; adrenalin for 
midbrain autonomies and sero- 
tonin for cortical personality. Now 
I see we’re ready. First, I’ll clear 
off the old molecules with an 
enzyme— cholinesterase, in this 
case. Now I’ll flood the chamber 
with labeled acetylcholine. Good 
response there. Isotope count 
shows about ninety percent of the 
expected acetylcholine sites are 
functioning. Good. Now I’ll do the 
same for adrenalin. The enzyme to 
clear the sites — the isotope-labeled 
neurochemical to count the sites. 
Readout: a hundred and ten 
percent. Nothing wrong there. 
Let’s try number three — sero- 
tonin.” 

They watched the tech work. 
The flimsy printout read: 
Acetylcholine 90%, Adrenalin 
1 10%, Serotonin 32%. 

“There’s the trouble — serotonin. 
Have to run a few more cells 
through to see if this is 
representative — but it probably 
is.” 

Walter asked, “But what caused 
it? It was so sudden.” 

Val interrupted: “He’s a jumper 
isn’t he? That’s inappropriate 
activity. The nest factor got him.” 

“Perhaps,” said the tech. “There 
is something blocking the serotonin 
synapses. I have some fluorescent- 
labeled antibodies that might help 
us identify the blocking agent. If it 
is the nest factor the sites are 



blocked by the deceased’s own 
immunoglobin-A. This first one is 
the anti-Ig-A.” 

The chamber flooded, glowed 
diffusely and then washed clear. 
“Nothing,” said the tech. “The 
next one is anti-M.R.” 

The chamber flooded again but 
this time a residual glow, remained 
on the cell wall after the wash. 

“Molecular Reward it is. This 
jumper thought he was a bird.” 

Val and Walter looked at each 
other, puzzled. 

“Sure. We see all kinds — mush- 
rooms, birds, flowers. That M.R. 
really scrambles some of them. 
It’s like sticking your foot in one 
of the mech brains — at the cellular 
level.” 

On the way to Hunter Control 
Walter waddled and wheezed. He 
paused for breath, leaning on the 
railing. Looking down, he asked, 
“Do you think Jo Jo had much 
pain? I mean, do you think he died 
happy?” 

“On M.R. he died happy,” said 
Val with finality. 

EMALE BITTER and Neutral 
Arthur were waiting to screen 
applicants for Jo Jo’s room when 
Va DPNH arrived with her locker. 

“Are you the bereaved?” asked 
*/4DPNH. 

Bitter frowned into the dimly lit 
crawl way. The newcomer was a 
slim female, recently polarized. 
She was on her hands and knees, 
towing a locker through the dust.

After a long silence Bitter an- 
swered, “Yes. We were widdled 
down this morning. What are 
you?” 

The newcomer smiled and sat 
back on her heels brushing grime 
from her hands explaining. “I’m 
V4DPNH. Embryonated from the 
delta pancreas line of the N.H. 
clone — Nora Howell clone, you 
know — one of the original Howell- 
Jolly bodies. Embryonated from 
the fourth subculture, so there is 
still a lot of genetic vigor in my 
DNA. I’d like to apply for the va- 
cancy.” 

Bitter repeated, “But, what are 
you?” 

“An attendant. All of us Nora 
Howells are attendants.” said Va- 
DPNH. “You can call me Dee 
Pen.” 

Bitter remained formal. “I’m 
sorry, W DPNH, but we can’t make 
the decision until the rest of the 
family reviews the applications. 
Now, if you’ll just move your gear 
back out onto the spiral — ” 

Neutral Arthur glanced down 
the crawlway at the other appli- 
cants. Big ones. Most were well 
over fifteen stone. Obviously a 
source of considerable body heat 
and odor. Big eaters too. He 
smiled at the slim newcomer. 

“An attendant? You’re so 
young,” he said. 

“Oh, not a Medi-attendant. Just 
an attendant. I haven’t yet special- 
ized. I’ll be servicing Rec centers 
for a while.” 



Bitter waved an index finger ac- 
cusingly. “Those breasts. You’re 
polarized.” 

“Almost. Only almost, I assure 
you,” pleaded */ 4 DPNH. “Some of 
Nora Howell’s DNA vigor expres- 
ses itself that way, I guess. But I 
carry the subcutaneous capsule — 
can’t actually ovulate.” 

She sniffed. 

Neutral Arthur consoled her 
with a shoulder pat. “Now, now. 
Dee Pen. Being polarized is diffi- 
cult. We understand. But it is good 
for an attendant — and can be good 
in the meld. Maturation Index, you 
know. Helps your sense of rhythm, 
they say.” 

Dee Pen blinked back a tear and 
nodded. “Rhythm, yes. Yes. I did 
very well at the stacks — good 
grades in music.” 

“And your nlajor? What was 
your major?” asked Arthur, help- 
ing her in with her bulky locker. 

“Philosophy — to balance the 
emotionalism of a polarized Jolly- 
body.” 

“But we already have a philoso- 
pher — Old Walter,” protested Bit- 
ter. 

“And you and old Walter will 
have plenty to talk about. Dee 
Pen,” said Arthur. Taking Bitter 
aside, he whispered: “Want anoth- 
er fifteen-stone furnace like Walter 
smelling up the place?” Bitter 
raised her eyebrows. Arthur con- 
tinued sotto voce: “Well, take a 
look out into the crawlway.” He 
went over to help Dee Pen sort

through her locker for her flimsy 
I.D. while Bitter poked her head 
out. As Arthur glanced over Dee 
Pen’s personality profile he could 
hear Bitter announcing that the va- 
cancy had been filled. He smiled. 
He knew a polarized Jolly-body 
would be very very good in their 
meld entertainments. 

Bitter waved the other applicants 
away and returned, saying, “We 
can have your credits transferred 
and be back up to family-five sta- 
tus for the evening meal.” 

V AL and Walter sat in the 
Hunter Control garage, watch- 
ing Tinker work. H.C. meek brain 
was still alert but, with surface 
sensors detecting no buckeyes, 
crops were safe and huntercraft 
had all returned for servicing. 
Tinker had all dust covers up on 
Doberman III and he was crawling 
around inside the chassis, mum- 
bling into his belt communicator. 
Occasionally a replacement part 
dropped into the dispenser. 

“So the M.R. got Jo Jo,” Val 
said to break the silence. 

Walter nodded sadly. 

“Better M.R. than l.A,” Val 
said. Waiter looked puzzled. Val 
continued: “Inappropriate Activity 
seems weak and sinful. Killing 
one’s self. Repulsive. I’d hate to 
think I lived with — trusted — some- 
one who would go l.A.” 

“And M.R.? He’s still dead.” 
“But that’s just an accident — 
drug idiosyncrasy. Going flower. 



bird or mushroom — those are the 
risks we take when we want to see 
heaven molecularly. Taking risks 
is sort of noble. Accidents are 
clean. But suicide — that’s dirty.” 

Walter did not answer. Odd, but 
he felt exactly the opposite. Tinker 
crawled out of the huntercraft’s 
chassis and wiped oil from his 
hands. He walked to the dispenser 
and picked up several coils of neu- 
rocircuitry webbing. Returning to 
the craft, he pulled on a connector. 
The big machine groaned. 

“Easy, big fellow. I know it 
hurts — but all those frayed nerves 
have got to come out,” said Tink- 
er. He talked over his shoulder to 
Val and Walter while he worked. 
“These huntercraft should have 
been sent to the central servicing 
area when it was operational. 
Their power converters and sensors 
are over a hundred years old. Elec- 
tron fatigue. No replacement parts 
for them — not these days.” 

Val picked up one of the craft’s 
optic pickups. “Their eyes are 
weak.” 

Tinker glanced back. “They 
need new electromag retinas. I can 
rebuild the coarse E.M. sensors in 
my quarters but I don’t have the 
tools for the fine work. Can’t han- 
dle the converters, of course. No 
one does that kind of work any 
more.” 

Val frowned at the mysterious 
converter above Doberman’s left 
rear wheel — a solid-state generator 
that converted electricity to mus- 



SONGOF KAIA 



27 





cie power; Other converters 
throughout the machine converted 
to heat, light or radio waves as the 
organ demanded. Converter science 
was a lost art. 

“You can rebuild sensors in 
your own room?” Val asked. 

“Just the coarse ones — and I 
have several rooms high up in the 
shaft, a long way from the dispen- 
sers on shaft base. Not much de- 
mand for quarters way up there.” 

Val was interested. He held tools 



for Tinker and asked questions 
while old Walter wheezed in the 
background. At change of shift Val 
helped Tinker carry a load of weak 
meek eyes to his quarters. Val was 
amazed at the jumble of parts that 
filled the corners and shelves — 
heads of agromechs, brain boxes 
from dispensers, communicators, 
sensors, tools and screens — even a 
rebuilt dispenser in front of his cot. 

Tinker saw Val staring at the 
dispenser. 






“Built it myself,” he explained 
proudly. “Of course, it isn’t an 
authorized model but it gives me 
someone to talk to — a class-thir- 
teen brain. But it can’t deliver any- 
thing unless the pressure reaches 
this level — which is seldom these 
days. I still have to use shaft base 
for most things.” 

Val walked slowly past the long 
work bench. Occasionally he would 
caress a box of wires or a small 
tool almost reverently. One bundle 



of thick wires trailed out of a large 
black drum. The drum stood on 
insulated blocks. It measured three 
feet in diameter and stood five feet 
high. Tinker waved him away when 
he approached it. 

“Careful. I’ve been experiment- 
ing with a larger capacitor to run 
my tools when the power is down. 
It’s probably well charged now and 
my insulation methods are pretty 
makeshift. Give it a good six feet 
clearance to be safe.” 



29 




Val eyed the bright connectors 
on the top of the drum. He mar- 
veled at Tinker’s ingenuity. The 
drum looked powerful, almost 
ominous, just sitting there. He 
gave it a wide berth and went on 
into the next room. More electron- 
ic gear faced him. Heavy cables 
led to a communicator with a fo- 
cusing antenna. Charts and maps 
covered one wall. 

“Listening to huntercraft and 
agromechs in the field,” explained 
Tinker, “is a hobby of mine.” 

Val recognized some of the to- 
pography from his own H.C. wall 
panels. He was amazed that any- 
one could build so much detail in- 
to a map from a few hours of ca- 
sual listening. 

They were interrupted by the 
dispenser. It started chattering and 
printing out a flimsy. Tinker went 
to read it while Val studied the 
map. 

“It’s a birth permit — for me,” 
Tinker shouted excitedly. 

Val smiled. “Congratulations, 
but it’s no surprise to me. Big ES 
must have recognized your tal- 
ents.” 

“But it’s a class-three permit.” 
Val thought a minute. “Class 
three means budchild with a human 
incubator of your choice. So?” 

“But I live alone.” 

Val glanced around at the 
crowded quarters. There was room 
for a family-7, except that every 
available square inch was filled 
with gear for tinkering. 



“Have a female in mind?” 

“No, and I’m not particularly 
interested either. A budchild is fine 
— I’m aware of my genes for intel- 
ligence and hard work — I was bred 
for hard work. I was a class-one 
birth permit myself — mechanical 
womb. Why would the Big ES 
want to burden me with a family- 
three now?” 

“I know just what you mean,” 
soothed Val. “I live alone myself 
— like it. Was lightly polarized two 
years ago — needed hard shoulders 
for the long bow — Sagittarius, you 
know — H.C. I got the hard shoul- 
ders all right but also I got some 
hair on my upper lip and an irrita- 
ble personality. I’m not interested 
in getting heavily polarized to full 
male gender — I’d probably have 
to shave and then I’d really be hard 
to work with. But, if Big ES asked 
me, I suppose I’d go along.” 

Tinker shrugged. “I don’t want 
my whole life upset by a class- 
three permit when a class-one 
would do just as well. Let the Big 
ES incubate.” 

Val left, saying, “Good Luck. 
See you in the garage next shift.” 

IV 

T he clerk at Embry ogenesis 
shook his head. “Sorry, Tinker 
— it stays a class-three. Our budget 
doesn’t permit us to carry any 
more births this month and your 
bud child is right on schedule. Re- 
quisitioned above our meek uteri

capacity. The committee report is 
final. Do your duty and pick a fe- 
male to carry it.” 

“That’s just it — 1 don’t have a 
female.” 

“No one appeals to you?” 

“I like everyone — but I’m not 
sexually attracted to—” 

“There’s no sex involved in a 
class three.” 

“But there is. Don’t you see?” 
Tinker was irritated. “A class three 
means female incubator of my 
choice. Right? The Big ES doesn’t 
pick the incubator, so it doesn’t 
have to pay job rates for carrying. 
The incubator has to carry it out 
of love for me — well, there is no 
one who will do it for me without 
pay.” 

The clerk studied the committee 
report. “No funds for moving it 
back to a class two either. Tinker. 
You’ll just have to find someone. 
That’s an order. Get yourself more 
heavily polarized.” 

Tinker reflexively clicked his 
heels. “Yes, sir. Right away, sir.” 
On his way to the Polarization 
Clinic, Tinker studied the sea of 
pasty white faces floating on the 
tangle of sticky, soft bodies — neu- 
tral citizens, anonymous, monoto- 
nous, ugly. Not a mind or a body 
he’d care to share his cubicle with. 
The clinic was closed. He rang. 
The attendant on call arrived an 
hour later. She was an edentulous 
old hag bent with age — arthritic — 
well up in her twenties and nearing 
retirement. 



“Going to swing hetero, hon- 
ey?” 

“It’s an order from the Big ES,” 
he said simply. 

Other than warming his loins, 
polarization seemed to do little for 
Tinker’s problem of finding an in- 
cubator. If anything, it made the 
chore more difficult. He became 
more critical of his fellow citizens. 
Fat old Walter was now disgusting- 
ly fat in spite of redeeming intel- 
lectual qualities. The press of hu- 
manity in the tubeways became in- 
tolerable with odors and textures 
he hadn’t noticed before. 

Tinker walked into the H.C. ga- 
rage with a sack of meek eyes and 
began to arrange them on Dober- 
man’s fender. 

“Polarization is tough,” he said 
to Val. “I vomited in the tubeways 
this morning. I’ve never done that 
before.” 

Val picked up an eye and ad- 
mired the bright fittings. “Polari- 
zation involves strengthening your 
neuro-humoral-axis. Humoral 
means gonads, adrenals and pitui- 
tary; but the neuro involves the 
autonomic system. Your auto- 
nomic tone is pretty high right 
now. Vomiting reflex is in there 
somewhere — it’s heightened too.” 

“But what have smells got to do 
with sex?” asked Tinker, climbing 
up to Doberman’s head. 

“You’ll have to go back down 
the evolutionary tree for that an- 
swer.” Val handed up an eye and a 
tool kit. “But I’d guess that sur-

face-dwelling hominids reacted 
with their environment more than 
we do — Big ES protects us. Most 
of us don’t even polarize spontane- 
ously any more. But when we do 
become polarized some of those 
ancient reflexes are activated. 

Tinker looked down at Val and 
asked, “What reflex is it that 
makes me so critical of everyone?’’ 

Val shrugged. 

Tinker continued: “Like you for 
instance, Val. I used to think you 
were a nice guy — ” 

“And?” 

“Now you look like a parasite,” 
said Tinker. “You follow Walter 
around and send hunters out to be 
killed. Now you’re following me 
around. You never do anything 
yourself.” 

“I’m young.” 

“Don’t give me that! You’re my 
age at least — almost twenty. 
You’re going to be as good as 
dead in half a dozen years — I’ll bet 
you’ve already got a loose tooth.” 

Val answered mildly, “Polariza- 
tion sure made you crusty. But I 
suppose that is natural, too. When 
you’re geared to picking a mate all 
of your senses are heightened. I 
suppose somewhere in your DNA 
memory molecules I’m a compet- 
ing male.” 

Tinker returned to his work 
while Val ruminated. 



T hat day something clicked in 
Tinker’s visual cortex. He was 



certain that the retinal images were 
unchanged but his brain now sorted 
everyone into two groups — neuts 
and polarized. 

A sullen male eyed him from 
across a sea of thousands of blank 
faces in the tubeway. He caught 
the glimpse of a shapely female 
form in the amorphous tangle at 
shaft base. If one out of ten thou- 
sand was a polarized female, she 
caught his eye. The rest of the 
crowd faded into the background 
like cardboard cutouts — nothings 
— nebishes. 

Little things began to bother 
him, like stepping over the remains 
of a jumper while lining up at the 
dispenser. Dispenser lines were too 
long now — too slow. He was an- 
gered by the sight of a beggar — 
swollen with wet beri-beri — who 
had to scurry through an access 
hatch to hide between walls to es- 
cape Medi-attendants who would 
have taken him to the suspension 
clinic. He stood silently while the 
meek sweeper scrubbed up wet 
spots left by the beggar’s oozing 
ulcers — then he shouldered his way 
through the docile crowd and went 
to the head of the line, ordering a 
container of thick barley broth. 
The dispenser eyed him suspicious- 
ly at this break in menu. He usual- 
ly ordered dry stables to stock his 
pantry. He took the soup to the 
access hatch and cracked the lid. 
The aroma brought out the beggar. 

“Flavored calories, old man,” 
said Tinker. 



32 



IF 




The beggar drank with trem- 
bling hands while Tinker looked in- 
to his dark nest. Unopened packets 
of calorie-basic were scattered 
around in the thick dust. No fla- 
vors. 

“That was nice,” said a female 
voice. 

Tinker turned to see a polarized 
female stepping out of the flowing 
crowd. She wore the tunic of the 
jobless caste and tightened her belt 
to accentuate her soft curves. He 
stared. 

“You’re focusing,” she said 
coyly. The apathetic crowd around 
them seemed to vanish. All he saw 
were her eyes, her mouth, her 
breasts. 

“What?” he stammered. 

“That was nice,” she repeated. 
“What you did for the old man 
there — giving him your meal.” 

His wits snapped back. Begging 
was forbidden, and giving alms was 
a function of Big ES. For a mo- 
ment he felt guilty. Next he was 
angered by his guilt and flared up. 
“I can afford it.” 

“It was still nice — nice that you 
noticed him.” she said, touching 
his caste emblem with her fingers. 
He backed away — intentional body 
contact was a meld activity. He 
felt awkward in public. 

“Who are you?” he asked. 

“I’m ViMRBL — second subcul- 
ture, Mu Renal cell line from B.L. 
clone. Age ten. Spontaneous po- 
larization — ah— puberty. Assigned 
to you by our Watcher.” 



He noticed a light locker behind 
her. She was ready to move in. 

“Assigned?” 

“Watcher took me out of the 
stacks before my studies were 
complete. I was assigned to a fam- 
ily-five before but I hesitated in the 
meld — never been in one before. I 
begged the Watcher to delay my 
assignment until I found a family- 
two to start with. I can work up to 
a family-five later, maybe. I think 
I’m too young for a big family.” 

Tinker looked her over analyti- 
cally. If her polarization had really 
been spontaneous and^ not some 
clandestine molecules smuggled in- 
to her food, then it was puberty — 
and he was looking at a female 
with a strong pituitary-ovary axis. 
A good incubator. 

“Come with me,” he said, tak- 
ing her by the hand and elbowing 
his way through the complacent 
queue to the dispenser. He loaded 
her arms with stables and then, 
shouldering her locker led her up- 
spiral to his rooms. 

He was pleasantly surprised at 
how well she fit into his crowded 
quarters — like a hand into a glove 
— into his cot, his refresher and 
even around the workbench — dust- 
ing and arranging where she was 
allowed and not touching where 
she wasn’t.

forearm and removed her anti- 
ovulation capsule. 

“Can’t have conflicting hor- 
mones — can we?” he said casual- 
ly as he held the raw edges of the 
incision together and sprayed them 
with syntheskin. Ignoring her 
winces, he gave her four quick Hi 
Vol injections of hormones to pre- 
pare her endometrium. “Come 
back in ten days and we’ll implant 
little Tinker, Jr.’’ 

“Could I see him now?’’ she 
asked. 

The tech brushed her toward 
the door. “Nothing to see now — 
just a clone soup in foaming nu- 
trients. Just be patient — in six 
months he’ll kicking and squirm- 
ing around in there. You’ll have a 
wonderful time.” 

But she didn’t have a wonderful 
time. Four weeks after implanta- 
tion she passed a larg clot. Wor- 
ried, she searched her locker for 
her old Ov earring. Her activity in 
the meld became warmer — more 
purposeful. She knew how slim 
their chances were for another 
birth permit. She’d probably be 
coded as a weak incubator and 
sterilized. Fearfully she watched 
the earring. Two weeks later it sig- 
naled an ovulation and her belly 
began to grow again — a little be- 
hind schedule, but it grew. Tinker, 
preoccupied with strange radio 
signals from the mountains, failed 
to notice anything unusual — but at 
forty-two weeks postimplantation 
the Empryo clinic asked her to 



come down for a checkup. She re- 
fused. 

REN?” asked a soft 
▼ -i^male voice. 

ViMRBL glanced up from her 
stitching and saw two Security po- 
lice in the doorway. Behind them 
were two more holding an awk- 
ward bundle of quarter staffs and 
throwing nets. Her face whitened 
visibly and one of the men glanced 
up from his scanner. 

“Reading in the T-zone. This is 
it,” he said. 

Two entered while the others 
took up positions back by the 
crawl way entrance on the spiral. 
They noticed her pendulous belly 
and tremulous, weak movements 
as she backed into the corner. 

“Relax and sit down somewhere 
— please,” said one of the men. 
“We’re just making a routine 
check on communicators. Nothing 
for you to be concerned about.” 

She sat on the cot, eyeing them 
suspiciously. They were soft 
males — reliable neuters — but there 
were four of them. Escape was im- 
possible. She waited. 

Tinker arrived with smiles and 
nods. He set the stable foodstuffs 
on the pantry shelf and answered 
questions. Yes, he had heard un- 
usual radio signals. No, he wasn’t 
using a tight-beam transmitter. 
No, he had no idea where the sig- 
nals came from. Yes, he’d keep 
them informed. They left — satis- 
fied. 



34 



IF 




''What was that all about?” she 
asked. 

“Not sure.” He closed the door 
to their quarters, secured it with a 
heavy hasp. He walked deliberate- 
ly to the bench and pressed one 
earphone to his right ear. “I’ve 
been hearing odd messages from 
the surface — and they’re not from 
authorized sources — not agro- 

mechs or Huntercraft.” 

His use of the term “author- 
ized” drained the color from her 
face again. She sat down. He no- 
ticed her distress and patted her 
on the knee. 

“Now, now — there’s no danger. 
Probably just a renegade meek 
with a WIC/RAC going through 
his identity crisis. Those what-if 
and random-association circuits 
sometimes break down the loyal- 
ties of the class-six mecks and they 
run amok until they deplete their 
energy cells. No danger. Just a 
few lost crops.” 

His words had little effect on 
his gravid female. Tears began to 
trail down her cheeks. 

“Our baby isn’t authorized.” 

He hadn’t heard her. He had 
both earphones on now and he was 
swinging his biconical antenna 
around trying to pick out mes- 
sages as they filtered through the 
many walls and organs of the city. 

“Good thing we have a high cu- 
bicle,” he mumbled to himself, 
“or I wouldn’t be getting any of 
this.” 

The sounds he heard were music 



— guitars, tambourines and waves 
— a pounding surf being trans- 
mitted by tight beam. The words 
he picked up were sing-songy. 
They sounded human, but he knew 
that class sixes could simulate al- 
most anything if they carried the 
proper gear. The words didn’t 
make sense — a chant of some 
sort. He caught the name, Olga. 

Tinker removed his earphones 
with a shrug. He had heard of the 
Followers of Olga — a fraternal 
organization more cultish than 
most. FOOs were in trouble with 
Security again — this time it 
looked as though they had gone 
Outside. He had worked in the 
garage at Hunter Control and 
thought it odd that the tight-beam 
source hadn’t attracted Hunter- 
craft before this. 

When he went to the cot he 
found Mu Ren sobbing herself to 
sleep. He patted her belly. A tiny 
foot kicked his hand. 

She opened reddened eyes and 
wailed, “Our baby isn’t author- 
ized.” 

“Of course it is,” he said. “I 
have the authorization right here.” 

“But we need a class five.” She 
filled him in about the clot she 
passed, the earring and now the 
call from Embryo clinic. 

“A hybrid,” he said in amaze- 
ment sitting up. “A hybrid?” 

“What’ll become of it?” she 
sniffed. 

“They’ll collect it — and dispose 
of it.”

She sobbed herself to sleep. 

T he next day Tinker explained 
to Val who was more con- 
cerned about the peculiar tight- 
beam transmissions. 

“Don’t let the pregnancy get 
you down. If it is unauthorized, 
it’s just unauthorized. Happens 
all the time. How long are you 
going to keep the baby?” 

Tinker shrugged. “It won’t need 
papers until it starts to walk and 
talk. We can keep it till then, I 
suppose.” 

Val shook his head. “I don’t 
think that’s a very good idea. I 
know some of the females do it to 
develop their souls, but it is hard 
to give them up just when they’re 
becoming human. I’d chuck it 
down the chute immediately if I 
were you. Now tell me more 
about those transmissions.” 

“I don’t think I could do it. I 
know it is patriotic and loyal and 
obedient — but I couldn’t do it.” 
“I’ll come over when she deliv- 
ers and do it for you — now what 
about those transmissions. Why 
aren’t we picking them up here at 
Hunter Control. If someone is 
Outside we should know about 
it.” 

Tinker was still badly shaken 
but he went to the wall panels and 
drew lines. The directional ran 
from the ocean across the shaft 
cap to the mountains. Val studied 
the line and then put the H.C. 



meek to work checking his sensors 
in that area. 

“Nothing on the line,” said H. 
C. 

“But Security is picking it up, 
too,” said Tinker. 

“What H.C. means,” explained 
Val, “is that there is nothing on the 
line where we have crops and 
where the sensors are. We don’t 
know what is above the frost line 
in the mountains — or under the 
water in the ocean.” 

Tinker brooded. 

Val smiled. “Come on. Let’s 
suit up and take Doberman, here, 
out on a shakedown cruise. We 
can look at the ends of your line 
for the renegade Followers of Ol- 
ga. The ride will ^o you good — 
take your mind off everything.” 

V 

D oberman hi moved 

smoothly across the fields at 
treetop level. 

“There’s already a sighting,” 
Val said. 

Tinker had his helmet pressed 
against the viewport. A bubble of 
sour gastric juice rose into his 
throat when he saw the body — 
naked and flaking red-brown. 
Roots and stolons from the high- 
auxin crop were invading the soft 
tissues. 

“A flower,” mumbled Val. 
“Molecular Reward?” asked 
Tinker. 

“Probably — but it is too late

for sampling now. Decomposed. 
Be nothing but bones left by har- 
vest time.” 

They moved on. Doberman 
maneuvered awkwardly in the thin 
air of the upper mountain slopes. 
They passed over a wind-swept ta- 
ble mountain and saw the relics 
of a tattered neolithic village. Fly- 
ing low, they stirred up clouds of 
dust and ash. 

“Used to be large numbers of 
the five-toed buckeyes around here 
till we hunted them down,” Val 
said. “But that was mostly before 
my time. No good hunts around 
here in years.” 

Tinker took a variety of views 
at different wave lengths. At long- 
red pickup he thought he saw a 
glow in some rocks set around 
ashes. Too faint to be certain. 

Tracking back across the shaft- 
cap, they flew on toward the dull 
gray ocean. The pounding surf on 
audio was familiar, not unlike the 
transmission. Tinker put optics 
on full sweep. Robot algae har- 
vesters moved on the horizon fol- 
lowing hints of green. The waters 
seemed almost sterile, they were 
so clear. Bubbles the size of build- 
ings dotted the shelf. Nothing 
moved in the water. 

Tinker stared into the water. 

“First time Outside?” asked 
Val. Tinker nodded. “Well those 
are relics of the past, too — under- 
water Rec centers. Our five-toed 
ancestors used to swim around 
down there, I guess. Some of the 



domes still have active power cells 
squeezing air out of the water 
with membrane pumps. Saw optic 
records one of our sewage-system 
subs took last year — vast empty 
chambers all over the ocean floor. 
Some were decorated with draw- 
ings of the extinct, bony fishes that 
used to live around here. Nothing 
alive down there now except a lit- 
tle plankton. Wish we had the 
technology and the animal species 
to farm the oceans again.” 

Tinker just stared. 

When they returned to Hunter 
Control Walter told them that Mu 
Ren had started labor. Tinker 
started to run downspiral. 

Val hurried to catch up. “Won’t 
the Medi-attendant be there?” 

“Not for an unauthorized preg- 
nancy.” 

They ran along in silence. The 
crowd density was low and they 
made good time. They arrived in 
plenty of time. Mu Ren’s contrac- 
tions were still three and a half 
minutes apart and the membranes 
were still intact. She was dozing 
between contractions. It would 
be a long night. 

T inker placed a sensor on her 
abdomen and watched the fetal 
and maternal cardiograms run 
across a screen. He had run 
through simulated deliveries a 
hundred times on his dispenser 
screen and his hands were skilled. 
The human body was just another 
type of machine to him — once he

learned the peculiarities of the 
warm, soft and sometimes wet 
anatomy. He put a board on the 
cot under her buttocks to prevent 
fluids from pooling around the 
outlet. 

“Position,” said the viewscreen’s 
meek brain with the next contrac- 
tion. 

As she had practiced, she auto- 
matically reached down and 
grabbed both legs behind the knees 
and pulled — flexing her legs up 
and out. The bag-of-waters bulged. 
Several contractions later it burst 
and the head bulged the perineum. 

“Presentation?” asked the view- 
screen. Diagrams appeared. Tink- 
er palpated the baby’s head for the 
skull suture lines. The larger dia- 
mond-shaped fontanel was posteri- 
or toward the sacrum. 

“The baby’s facing the sacrum,” 
said Tinker, smiling. 

“Most favorable position,” said 
the screen. One diagram remained, 
labeled Occiput Anterior. 

With the next contraction the 
little head bulged way out and the 
perineum stretched. 

“Ritgeh rag,” said the view- 
screen. Tinker picked up a coarse- 
ly woven hand-towel and sup- 
ported the perineum. 

“Check cord,” said the screen 
as the head cleared. He flicked 
mucus from the little nose and 
mouth as he felt deep between the 
baby’s neck and shoulder. A slip- 
pery, tense loop of umbilical cord 
encircled the neck. He dug his 



middle Finger quickly under the 
loop. It wouldn’t budge. 

“One loop,” he said as his right 
hand darted to his little work table 
for the three snub-nosed instru- 
ments. Clamp — clamp — cut be- 
tween. With the next contraction 
he guided the head down to release 
the anterior shoulder from under 
the pubic bone — and then upward 
to release the posterior shoulder. 
Suddenly the rest of the infant fol- 
lowed in a gush of fluids and a 
jumble of glistening cord. He 
wiped its face with a clean hand 
towel and gave it to Val who held 
it awkwardly and turned up his 
nose. The baby wasn’t moving. Its 
eyes and mouth were closed and 
the skin' was a wrinkled, dull white 
covered with cheesy mucus — ugly! 

“Better chuck it down the diges- 
tor chute before she hears it cry 
and ruins her day,” Val said, hold- 
ing it out like a piece of garbage 
gone sour. 

Tinker nodded and mumbled 
something. He was preoccupied 
with the placenta which now 
bulged out in front of a ball of 
copious, jelly-like clots. 

Val started the long crawl to- 
ward the spiral, leaving a trail of 
cloudy white drops in the dust. 
The infant squirmed hard and gave 
a single loud cry. He tried not to 
look at it. 

Val eyed the digestor chute un- 
comfortably. Stained and granu- 
lar, it spoke of the varieties of 
solid wastes it had accepted in the

past. It was several hundred feet 
down — a dark, traumatic trip. He 
moved the selector switch between 
chop and dice. 

“She’s bleeding bad,” called 
Tinker. 

Val looked back to see Tinker’s 
worried face in the crawlway open- 
ing. 

“Did you press on the uterine 
fundus?” asked Val. 

“Yes. Bleeding slowed — but 
hasn’t stopped. I’m worried. Can’t 
we call the medi-attendant now? 
Maybe they’ll have drugs or some- 
thing to stop it.” 

“Not for an unauthorized preg- 
nancy,” Val said. He glanced 
down the little form in his right 
hand. The baby was crying vigor- 
ously now. It’s face pinked up and 
it was blinking around from wide, 
dark eyes. 

They returned to the cot. Mu 
Ren was trying to massage her 
uterus. Blood flowed. She tried to 
protest when Tinker handed her 
the infant. 

“Take it,” he said firmly. “Just 
pretend it’s medicine — breast-feed 
it. It’ll help the bleeding.” 

She was awkward but the infant 
knew exactly what to do — it 
locked on firmly and began to 
suck. Immediately the uterine 
fundus hardened to a ball. The 
bleeding stopped. 

Tinker relaxed. ‘‘He doesn’t 
know he’s unauthorized,” he said. 
The child was male — and had five 
toes. 



M U REN and Tinker grew 
fond of infant in the days 
that followed. They called him 
Tinker Two/Junior, using the 
name they had picked out for the 
bud child. They applied for a vari- 
ance on their original class-three 
birth permit. 

‘‘Sorry, sir,” said the clerk. 
“Your own record is commend- 
able, of course, but with a hybrid 
we must consider the mother’s 
genes, too. Mu Ren has shown 
several anti-ES traits: spontane- 
ous polarization/puberty, clandes- 
tine pregnancy and failure to obey 
a clinic summons. You’ll have to 
admit that she even kept the hy- 
brid status of the infant a secret 
from you. Very poor record. No 
variance.” 

“Even if I make it a condition 
for my future work as a tinker?” 
The clerk had an answer. 
“You’re receiving flavored calo- 
ries. You couldn’t live on calorie- 
basic — or could you?” 

Tinker set his jaw. 

“The committee’s vote is final,” 
said the clerk, waving him out. 

One night he listened to unfa- 
miliar chants on his earphones. 
Something moved in his peripheral 
vision. He turned to see the baby. 
“He’s already crawling — ” 

Mu Ren picked up Junior hug- 
ging him hard. “He’s a big boy,” 
she said sadly. 

Tinker turned purposefully to 
the communicator. He tried in his 
five-foot capacitor, poured water

in the heat sink and checked the 
polarity reversal. A shaped field 
probed around the room, rustling 
loose tools. He narrowed to tight 
beam and transmitted. 

“Who’s out there?” 

The music continued and his 
screen showed diffuse, concentric, 
dancing circles. The music stopped 
and the circles collapsed to a pin- 
point as the other tight beam 
locked onto his position. A metal- 
lic voice answered. 

■ “Identify yourself.” 

“I’m Tinker of H.C. City. Who 
are you?” 

“Ball — companion and protec- 
tor,” said the voice. 

“A renegade meek?” 

“Free meek,” corrected the 
voice. “If you are a good Tinker 
we can use you. You are welcome 
to come here to Mount Tabulum 
and share our flavors — and free- 
dom.” 

Tinker exchanged glances with 
Mu Ren, turned to his map. Ball 
was speaking of the location of the 
tattered neolithic village. It would 
take them several weeks to get 
there. There were several canals 
and many open fields to cross — 
miles of them. 

“It will be difficult. We’ll be 
hunted,” Tinker said. 

“We’ll try to decoy the hunters. 
Don’t carry anything made of 
metal and travel at night. Stay in 
the taller vegetation and well be- 
low the canal banks as much as 
possible. Travel more than ten 



miles a day so the Hunter sensors 
won’t get a fix on you. I must sign 
off now — questing fields are tick- 
ling our beam.” 

“Who was that?” asked Mu 
Ren. 

“I’m not sure but we’ll find out. 
We’re going Outside.” When he 
saw her face drop he added reas- 
suringly: “Don’t worry. I think 
I’ve got it all figured out. We’ll 
need coveralls to protect our pho- 
tosensitive skins at first. 1 think I 
know enough about Huntercraft 
to stay clear of them. If we travel 
fast and travel at night — we’ve got 
a very good chance.” 

“We’ll be killed,” she blurted. 
“If we escape the hunters the 
buckeyes will eat us.” 

He gave her a nonritual hug and 
nodded toward Junior asleep on a 
pile of issue tissue. She under- 
stood. That evening he made four 
trips to shaft base — acting casual- 
ly — to order extra clothing and 
food from the dispenser. His credit 
account grew strained. Being care- 
ful not to include metals, he made 
up belt-and-shoulder-sized bundles 
containing stables and Stone-Age 
tools of synthetics. 

“Planning on going some 
place?” a voice asked from the 
doorway. 

Startled, Tinker turned to see 
the two Security police. 

Smiling and nodding like a good 
citizen. Tinker approached them. 
“Certainly, a Climb. My vacation. 
You must have heard.”

IF 




The two neuters hesitated. “We 
came to check on the tight-beam 
transmission. Questing fields 
pointed to your level. The unau- 
thorized infant is still here, too. 
Those packs are not regulation for 
a Climb. You’re in real trouble 
this time.’’ 

Tinker said, “Just check on my 
vacation authorization.” Two 
more neuters blocked the crawl- 
way to spiral with quarterstaffs 
and throwing net. He could proba- 
bly bull his way through alone — 
but not with Mu Ren and the kid. 
“We were just on our way to 
chuck the kid down the chute.” 

The neuters called in for infor- 
mation on his Climb. He mo- 
tioned for Mu Ren to pick up Jun- 
ior. Then he fumbled casually with 
the audio settings of the commun- 
icator. 

“Nothing on the Climb,” said 
the neuter. He approached with a 
pair of hobbles. “Sorry, Tinker, 
but we’ve got to take you down to 
the Psych clinic. Your behavior 
has become very anti — ” 

Tinker flipped the switch, filling 
the room with 160 decibels of 
10,000 hertz sound. Using a four- 
foot length of flexicable, he 
whipped his way past the two neu- 
ters, pushed Mu Ren and the baby 
out and away from the pair with 
the nets and quarterstaffs. An 
access hatch let him and his fami- 
ly between the walls and an air 
vent brought them to the surface. 
The sun was shining brightly. They 



peered through the louvers at the 
brilliantly colored fruits and vege- 
tables. 

“We forgot our packs and pro- 
tective clothing,” said Mu Ren. 

“Don’t worry. We can wait till 
nightfall. They won’t find us here. 
No one knows the ’tween walls 
like a Tinker.” 

They caught their breath. After 
a few minutes of gazing at the gar- 
dens he added: “There’s one thing 
we don’t have to worry about Out- 
side.” 

She looked up quizzically. 

“Food.” 

4 4 one buckeye? I mpossible. 

vyNot Tinker,” Val shouted 
as he paced around Tinker’s de- 
serted quarters. 

“Well it wasn’t I. A. or M.R. 
He knew exactly what he was do- 
ing.” said the Security captain. 
“Even injured one of my men.” 

“But he doesn’t have five toes.” 

The Security captain smugly 
produced a flimsy. “Look at his 
ridge width and his triradii/loop 
ratio.” 

Walter studied the analysis of 
Tinker’s hand/foot prints. 

“The gene,” murmured Walter, 
passing the flimsy to Val. “He 
was such an achiever.” 

“Achievers give us the most 
trouble,” said the captian. “They 
carry the / gene of the In-between. 
Their independence and initiative 
make them very poor team play- 
ers — and usually anti-ES.” 



42 



IF 




“The bad gene,” mumbled Val. 
“And I let the kid live.” 

“You’ll send out a squad of 
hunters, of course,” said the cap- 
tain. Val nodded. 

A t hunter control 

Walter tightened the loops on 
Val’s suit and handed him his hel- 
met. “Wall charts from Tinker’s 
room overlay ours quite well. He 
knows where he is going. Do you 
think you should go after him 
alone?” 

Val nodded grimly. “No sense 
scrambling a whole platoon of 
hunters. They’d need drugs to go 
Outside, anyway — so we could 
only use them one at a time. I 
know Tinker. Maybe I can talk 
him back.” 

“If you can’t?” 

“I’ll be in Bird Dog Nine— I’ll 
be all right.” 

“And Tinker?” 

“It had to be his decision. My 
hands arc tied. If he wants to lay 
down his life for an unauthorized 
kid and some anti-ES female — 
well — I’ll just let him do that.” 
Val picked up the heavy longbow. 
“I’ll just be doing my duty. You 
stay and keep an eye on H.C. I 
don’t like all the tight-beam activ- 
ity on the surface — the buckeyes 
may be coming out of hiding. One 
of the lesser planets might be mov- 
ing into a more favorable aspect 
for them. Stay alert.” 

“The sensors have never been 
off. There have been no sightings 



— no even of Tinker and his fami- 
ly-three.” 

“I think I know where to look 
for him — he knows how to avoid 
sensors but he has no protective 
gear. He’ll be holed up during the 
day. Can’t get far,” Val said. 

Bird Dog lifted off. Its bronze- 
and-yellow hull rotated slowly to- 
ward the garage door. Hunter 
Control was quiet again. Walter 
sat down and studied playbacks 
from Tinker’s dispenser memory 
unit. He ran it through the psy- 
chokinetoscope, searching for 
those telltale fine body movements 
that marked psychosis — but he 
found no evidence of I.A. Tinker 
and Mu Ren were acting logically 
up till the end. 

Walter mumbled to himself. 
“But going buckeye has to be in- 
appropriate. They’ll be hunted 
down. They’ll surely die.” 

B ird dog settled down quiet- 
ly in a grove of fruit trees. Its 
optics scanned the canal that led 
away from Tinker’s shaftcity. Val 
waited confidently. Dusk was still 
several hours away. 

“I have a sighting,” said Bird 
Dog unexpectedly. 

Val reached for his bow, mut- 
tering, “The sun is still up. Tinker 
knows better than to expose his 
epidermis to — ” 

But the form that came around 
the bend was not one of fugitives. 
It was a powerful, rogue coweye. 
Val cringed as he read the scanner. 



SONG OF KAIA

“It’s a big one. Must be eigh- 
teen inches taller than me — a six- 
footer at least — and reading way 
over in the luteal phase.’’ 

Walter’s voice asked, “Can you 
get in a shot?’’ 

Val nocked his arrow and mo- 
tioned for Bird Dog to open the 
window. Bird Dog said, “No one 
can shoot from inside my cabin. 
I can not take an active role in 
the killing of any hominid. Prime 
directive. You’ll have to step Out- 
side to shoot. Expose yourself.’’ 
“I’m a supervisor — ” 

Val cursed as Bird Dog re- 
mained silent. He realized the fu- 
tility of argument and buckled in- 
to his harness. Their quarry moved 
into deeper water and submerged 
as Val cracked the hatch. Bird 
Dog lifted off in a cloud of leaves 
and scanned the canal. Nothing. 
Val swung downharness, landing in 
the coweye’s path on the opposite 
bank. Renocking his arrow he 
waited in silence. Bird Dog moved 
off in its passive role as taxi — 
waiting. Val tried to estimate how 
far the coweye could have swum 
while he was in the air. Watching 
the quiet, mint-green waters he 
moved on down the bank — cau- 
tious — nervously alert. Then he 
stumbled over something slippery, 
wet and cold — the coweye. 

Walter’s voice sputtered out of 
his communicator: “Quick, shoot 
her. She’s very dangerous.’’ 

Val bent down and nudged her 
with his hand — she was stone cold. 



“Not this one. She’s dead — she 
reads negative on my detector. 
Must have died of fright or exer- 
tion.’’ 

Val signaled to be picked up 
again. 

“Aren’t you going to take a 
trophy?’’ asked Walter. 

“Me? A supervisor? I’m here to 
catch Tinker. Lost too much time 
already. Besides, she’ll still be here 
in the morning.’’ 

Darkness settled. Val waited — 
sipping a warm drink and watching 
an entertainment channel while the 
huntercraft scanned. 

“Something — ’’ whispered the 
machine. 

“Give me the hi-lo beam out- 
side the visual range. I want to get 
a good look at — ” Val paused, 
open-mouthed. “The coweye.’’ 

He watched the long-haired, 
muscular female rewarm and 
climb from the thick kale greens 
into the warm canal. In another 
moment she was gone, powerful 
strokes carrying her away under 
the surface. 

“They’re immortal.’’ 

“Get hold of yourself,” cau- 
tioned Walter. “I saw it, too. Bet- 
ter call off your hunt and get back 
here. This reminds me of that 
buckeye kill near Filly’s mountain. 
Remember? Foxhound went and 
came back with the trophy but 
Sampler found only blood clots 
and the arrows.” 

Val nodded. “But that one had 
fatal injuries. We decided that 



44 



IF 




aquatic flesh-eaters must have got- 
ten the remains.” 

Walter reviewed the sensor 
readings on both cases. “Just sup- 
pose for a moment that Filly’s 
buckeye is alive, as we know last 
night’s was — ^just suppose. What 
is the logical explanation of the 
spontaneous hypothermia we ob- 
served?” 

Val shrugged. “All I can think 
of is something occult — but I 
don’t believe in anything like that. 
You’re not going to drag in soul- 
migration theory are you?” 

Walter smiled. “No — something 
much simpler and biological. Hi- 
bernation. Reflex hibernation. 
We’re dealing with an aborigine, 
after all — and they have very high 
neuTohumoral tone. Partial hiber- 
nation has frequently been ob- 
served in these primitive hominids 
in the past. It took heat-seeking 
hunters to bring out the gene that 
permits a buckeye to play pos- 
sum.” 

Val said, standing up, “From 
now on we’ll put down a hunter at 
each sighting and let him tramp 
around until he finds the helpless 
buckeye. Killing them when 
they’re cold should be easy.” 

VI 

T he 5-toed villagers of Table 
Mountain busied themselves 
with survival chores — drying 
grains, fruit and meat; sewing hides 
and gathering vegetable fuels. At 



dusk Tinker, Mu Ren and the ba- 
by left the lengthening shadows 
and approached the settlement. 
Tinker felt defeated. His issue tis- 
sue garments had all but disinte- 
grated after three days of swim- 
ming and crawling. During the fol- 
lowing weeks their exposed skin 
had torn like flimsies on the under- 
growth and peeled in the sun. His 
muscles affid joints were badly 
swollen. 

A village male — puberty plus 
ten — quickly identified them from 
their appearance and welcomed 
them with '^ gourd of water. He 
stood a foot taller than Tinker and 
had heavily sinewed arms and a 
leathery skin. His sturdy mate 
rolled out her sleeping mat and 
motioned to Tinker and his family 
to lie down. Four bright-eyed chil- 
dren peeked out of the hide-cov- 
ered wickiup. Tinker tried to make 
Mu Ren comfortable, then col- 
lapsed himself, bleeding and oozing 
from a hundred minor injuries. 

“Welcome, citizens.” 

Tinker opened his eyes to see the 
village leader. Unlike the others, 
who wore only loin cloths, he had 
on long purplish robes and wrap- 
pings on his feet and legs. He was 
as tall and sinewy as the others, 
though, and under his arm he car- 
ried a bright, metalloid sphere. The 
voice came from the sphere. 

“Welcome citizens. I am Ball.” 

Tinker moaned a greeting. 

The robed leader squatted down 
slowly, the Ball in his lap. His 



SONG OF KAIA

joints were stiff and his bald head 
and wrinkled face told Tinker how 
really ancient he was. 

“I am the Hip — keeper of the 
Bali. »Ball has kept Table Moun- 
tain safe, from the hunters,” said 
the leader. 

Tinker sat up, winced and lay 
back again. 

Hip stood up, motioning for two 
coweyes to bring bowls of warm 
water and nut oils. 

‘‘They’ll bathe your wounds,” 
said Hip. ‘‘We can talk later when 
you mend — and mend fast. The 
villagers can use your skills.” 

While the coweyes dressed their 
wounds Tinker glanced around a 
little nervously. Counting toes, he 
soon realized that he and Mu Ren 
were the only 4-toeds in the vil- 
lage. He put a protective arm over 
her and fell into the sleep of ex- 
haustion. 

In the months that followed he 
took his place in the village — hunt- 
ing canals for cetacean meat and 
hides, building a shelter and forag- 
ing gardens for calories. Junior 
grew at a 5-toed pace; matching 
the junglebunnies in neuromuscu- 
lar development. Tinker and Mu 
Ren were happy. 

T he meld tightened and warmed 
up around fat old Walter. Dee 
Pen wiggled on her belly, working 
her Jolly-body through the arms 
and legs to a position on the top. 

“Soul?” she said, picking up 
where she had left off before the 



warming. “Of course man has a 
soul — a nice comfortable share in 
the collective soul of Big ES. 
That’s why mankind has become 
such a successful life form on the 
planet — he forms hives.” 

Old Walter wheezed as he 
moved o<ie of his arms out of the 
meld to cool. “I prefer to think of 
man’s soul as the life principle of 
ancient individual man. He’s 
traded that now for his parasitic 
existence in the hive.” 

Dee Pen recoiled at such anti- 
ES blasphemy. Arthur reached 
through and patted her soothingly. 

“Now, now. Don’t mind old 
Walter. He’s just trying to goad 
you into a philosophical debate. 
Tell me more about your works 
on the viola.” 

Dee Pen ignored Arthur. She 
flared, producing interesting ef- 
fects in the meld. “The citizen is 
not a parasite in ES. He is part of 
it. Look at all the good that has 
come from the Big ES — without it 
the earth couldn’t support a tenth 
of its present population.” 

“Greatest good for the greatest 
number?” prodded Walter. 

“Certainly — man has replaced 
many of the lower life forms on 
the planet. More intelligent life is 
better than less.” 

“A hundred pounds of man is 
better than an equal weight of bugs 
and worms?” 

“Of course.” 

“And trees?” 

She searched for the didactics 



46 



IF 




on trees: “Trees were just the fab- 
ric of the Jungle ecosystem. Cities 
are the ecosystem of man. The 
only trees we need are food trees, 
flavor trees — man’s food chain.” 
Walter began to lose his grip in 
the moist meld. He changed his 
position and asked, “What about 
men’s minds? Hasn’t I. A. been in- 
creasing with the evolution of Big 
ES? Suicides were nonexistent in 
the Stone Age — they’re the princi- 
pal cause of death now.” 

“Weak genes,” she countered. 
“The jungles weeded out the weak- 
body genes with carnivores — now 
the Big ES is weeding out the 
weak-mind genes with I. A.” 

Walter smiled. Little Dee Pen 
had graduated with all the basic 
ES philosophy. She trusted that 
some future 4-toed population 
would be free from LA. Walter 
wondered. As a Dabber he clung to 
some of the old philosophies of the 
neolithics — dirt, adobe and bam- 
boo. He had even been a Follower 
of Olga in his youth — and as a 
F.O.O. he had awaited the return 
of Olga. But as his life span was 
drawing to a close he was losing 
faith. 



T inker wondered at the large 
stores of dried meats the village 
was preparing. Each day Ball sent 
young female “bait” to walk in 
front of buckeye sensors. Burly 
spearchuckers followed and re- 
turned with freshly quartered 



meat. Hip supervised a group of 
coweyes who were trimming. 

“Looks a bit watery to me,” 
said Tinker. 

“Agree. But it is the best there 
is. The Hive always sends us the 
best — protein-poor-protoplasm 
that it is.” 

“Why the large stores? Expect- 
ing a long winter?” 

Hip nodded toward Ball. “It’s 
for the trek. We go to gather at 
the river. Olga is returning.” 

The villagers bowed their heads 
at the holy words of their seer. 
Tinker kept a respectful silence 
and then murmured a line from 
one of the buckeye prayers. 

“The great coming together ...” 
The astrologers had finally 
agreed on the time for the fullfill- 
ment of the five-thousand-year-old 
legend. 

F oxhound XI returned from 
the hunt to face Val’s wrath. 
“Lost the entire squad again?” 
Foxhound coughed, clouding his 
screen. “I put them down on fresh 
spoor. They went into tracking 
frenzy smoothly — but when I re- 
turned to pick them up they were 
gone.” 

Val hit the screen with the palm 
of his hand to clear the focus. 
“Didn’t you see anything?” 

Foxhound coughed again. 
“Weak eyes. Sorry. You can re- 
view the optic records if you want. 
I need new eyes.” 

Val let his anger subside. “I’m 



48 



IF 




the one who should be sorry — old 
meek. Your eyes have been on or- 
der. It looks like it will be a long 
time yet. We need lots of parts.” 
Back at his desk Val put in a 
call to the class-one meek that co- 
ordinated priorities for the Big ES. 
He stated his case briefly and gave 
the requisition numbers. After re- 
ceiving the usual conciliatory ex- 
cuses he exploded. 

“In the last three months alone 
I’ve lost over a hundred hunters in 
the Orange sector — ” 

“Are the crops in danger?” 

“No, but the hunters — ” 

“The crops are your primary 
concern. Population control is not 
your worry.” 

“Population control? I’m talk- 
ing about hunters. They’re out 
there protecting our crops. We 
should protect them.” 

“Get hold of yourself, Sagittar- 
ius. You must look at this prob- 
lem in the right perspective. The 
Orange sector’s suicide rate is thir- 
ty thousand per day right now. 
You can’t be bothering me with 
the loss of one hunter per day. It is 
a small price to pay for the protec- 
tion of all the sector’s crops — the 
calories and flavors for a popula- 
tion of five hundred million citi- 
zens.” 

Val relaxed. Maybe he was los- 
ing sight of the overall picture. He 
thanked Olga that he wasn’t re- 
sponsible for cleaning up 30,000 
bodies a day. Keeping his hunter- 
craft operating seemed to be one 



of the easiest chores in the Big ES. 

W ALTER was late for work 
and Val dropped in on him at 
his quarters. He found the old man 
in bed, face ashen gray — female 
Bitter was rubbing his cold hands 
and feet. 

“Life span coming to an end?” 
asked Val. 

The old man nodded, smiling 
weakly. 

Val said, “It was a good life — 
you did your duty to the hive. 
Shall I call a Medi-attendant?” 
Walter’s face changed from gray 
to blue with exertion. 

“My life isn’t over yet — not 
quite yet.” 

Bitter pleaded, “He’s got some 
sick-time coming. Let him rest at 
home till he feels better.” 

Val understood. No one came 
back from suspension these days. 
Not at the present level of popula- 
tion density. 

“Sure. Sure. 1 can hold down 
the fort. We haven’t had more than 
a single sighting each day anyhow. 
I’ll just sleep in at H.C. Cover 
your shift too.” 

Walter relaxed and slept. His 
face pinked up a little. 

Several days later he wheezed 
into Hunter Control to find Val 
and three techs working on a pile 
of junk — boxes, wires, tubes and 
screen — none of wJiich seemed to 
belong together. 

“What’s that?” he asked. 

Val looked up from a crude 



SONG OF KAIA 



49 




splice and said, ""It’s some of the 
gear from Tinker’s quarters. The 
techs think it is a working tight- 
beam set. The magnetic squeeze 
component has very Fine tuning. 
We’ve been listening for unauthor- 
ized transmissions from the Out- 
side.” 

“Pick up anything?” 

“Lots. Crazy things. We put 
them in the audio, so you play it 
back. There must be more than 
one renegade meek out there with 
the buckeyes. I can’t understand 
why any meek would give up his 
power socket in the garage to run 
with the wild five-toeds.” 

“The mecks probably identify 
with them.” 

Walter set the audio to play and 
print. 

“Identify?” 

“Sure. Oh, of course they rely 
on the Big ES for their power — 
but a meek is basically a worker. 
He does his job — a Door, a Tiller, 
a Repair-bot — and he has to be 
strong and fast to do his job well. 
Five-toeds are strong and fast, 
too.” 

Val was irritated by the compar- 
ison. “You mean that the ma- 
chines prefer one of those wild sav- 
ages to a citizen just because the 
citizen gets a little fat?” 

“Not all machines,” explained 
Walter. “But there are billions of 
meek brains on the planet, all pro- 
gramed to admire speed, strength 
and efficiency in fellow machines. 
In any distribution curve you are 



bound to get some mecks who ap- 
ply value judgments to humans 
too.” 

“Just a bad circuit,” said Val. 
“Like the Buckeyes have the bad 
gene.” 

“Same effect, I guess.” 

Walter began to listen to the 
tight-beam playbacks. 

Val said, “That first collection 
of chants has been put together 
from a bunch of bits and pieces — 
the computer simulated parts and 
tried to make it intelligible. Ap- 
parently it is an expostulation of 
the five-toed virtues or vices.” 

A five-toed Buckeye desires 
to run free. 

He possesses immunological 
competency. 

He mates and runs and then he 
lives alone. 

He eats red mean and marrow 
from the bone. 

He has a five-toed heart and 
heavy skeleton. 

With abundant calcium salts 
and collagen. 

His neurohumoral autonomies 
and gamma- A 

Keep him out of the Hive 
where souls turn gray. 

He keeps the rainbow colors 
of his genes; 

Melanocytes that mark the

Walter didn’t catch the words 
the first time — they were spat fast 
against a rapid jingle of tambou- 



50 



IF 




fines and a running guitar base. 
He replayed it, following the 
printed flimsy. 

“Crazy?” said Val. 

Walter nodded and moved on to 
the next part of the playback. Val 
talked absently while he reworked 
the splice. 

“We all know the buckeyes are 
different — but why would a ma- 
chine sing about it.” 

“Maybe it is a singing ma- 
chine.” 

Walter listened again. 

Oh, Happy Day; Oh, Happy 
Day, 

When Olga comes. 

She* ll show the way . 

Walter coughed and his face 
darkened for a second. “This sing- 
ing machine sounds like a Follow- 
er of Olga.” 

Val finished his rewiring and 
stepped back. 

“The only way to establish a 
tight beam is to let them know 
we’re here so they can focus. 
Should be able to pinpoint their 
location. Where is that smoke 
coming from?” 

The capacitor steamed, and its 
black insulation bubbled. Wires 
sparked and smoke rose from the 
heat sink. One of the techs poured 
water into the sink. 

He apologized. 

“It was dry.” 

Val grumbled, “The screen has 
clouded. This is all we can do till 



we get replacement parts, I guess.” 
“Can we still listen?” Walter 
asked. 

“I suppose so^but we’ll never 
catch them that way.” 

VII 

T inker moved eastward ahead 
of the villagers. When they left 
the mountains he searched out the 
Buckeye sensors and disabled them 
subtly. A loosened fitting or a pile 
of kale leaves on the lens was 
enough to protect the passing vil- 
lagers but not enough to alert 
Hunter Control. 

Two spearchuckers stood by 
Mu Ren and Junior while Tinker 
smeared mud on himself. He part- 
ed the thick rhubarb leaves and 
looked at the buckeye detector on 
the next ridge. Two hundred yards 
of open, freshly plowed soil stood 
in the way. 

“I think I recognize that B.D. 
model. The optics would be pretty 
senile by now. It shouldn’t be able 
to pick me out if I move slowly.” 
he said. 

They watched him crawl almost 
casually toward the tower. The 
ball of neurocircuitry and sensors 
continued its monotonous rota- 
tion. His mud camouflage seemed 
to be working. A Tiller worked the 
soil near the base of the tower. The 
bulky machine politely moved out 
of the way while he studied the 
base of the tower for the cable. He 
pulled the plug and smeared the 



SONG OF KAIA 



51 




contacts with mud. Then he re- 
placed the plug — smiling at the 
Tiller as he left. 

“That should fog up reception 
enough to protect us.'' he said 
waving the first groups of villag- 
ers across the ridge. 

Mu Ren eyed the Tiller suspi- 
ciously. 

“Come on," said Tinker. “The 
agromech is going about his work 
— tilling. He wouldn't report us 
unless ordered to. Ball is still mon- 
itoring. There's nothing to worry 
about — yet." 

B ack in Orange Sector Hun- 
ter Control was very quiet. 
“Care to serve on the megajury 
today?" asked Walter. 

Val was dozing at his console. 
He stirred. “Don't ne ed t he cal- 
ories. What kind of a case is it?" 

“Interesting kind," said Walter. 
“Some buckeye broke into a sus- 
pension clinic two thousand miles 
from here and killed a quarter of 
a million patients." 

“What's so interesting about the 
Mass-murder Syndrome?" mum- 
bled Val as he changed his posi- 
tion in his chair and closed his eyes 
again. 

“The killer was a citizen from 
our sector before he went buckeye. 
I just watched the court simula- 
tion. He traveled all that way on 
the Outside." 

Val's eyes opened sharply. “Over 
two thousand miles on the Outside 
to kill patients?" he said incredu- 



lously. “Must be one of those fa- 
natics trying to assassinate some 
imagined political enemy from the 
past." 

“No, we checked that." 

“We?" 

Walter explained that Security 
had been all through the sector 
looking for contacts the killer had 
known. The political motive wor- 
ried the Big ES. One citizen was 
taken back — the neighbor of the 
killer. They were being tried to- 
gether with an accomplice from 
inside the clinic itself. 

Val tuned in on the trial and ap- 
plied for megajury duty. He was 
accepted. A replay of the simula- 
ted crime began on his screen. 

The screen showed the killer 
with a male accomplice and a 
small four-legged carnivore. Hun- 
ters were encountered several 
times and only the killer reached 
the clinics at Dundas Harbor. 
There he enlisted a female accom- 
plice and tampered with the en- 
vironmental controls, killing the 
sleeping victims. The trial scene 
showed a wild-eyed fanatic wear- 
ing white robes and waving a staff. 

“Ludicrous," said Val. “There's 
no sense to it." 

“Look at thre voting pattern. 
“Most of megajury wants to let 
the fellow go — and do you know 
why?" 

Val shrugged. 

“Because another quarter 
million of the suspended were 
cured of their neoplasms — evident- 



52 



IF 




ly the heat, the pyrotherapy, 
burned out some of the tumors 
and left the patients alive. Now 
they are cured and don’t have to 
go back into suspension.” 

Val studied old Walter’s face. 
“There’s something you’re not 
telling me. What is it?” 

“They’re all five-toed. The man 
on trial has released five-toeds 
from suspension — thousands of 
them.” 

Val shrugged again. “It still 
sounds like a political crime to 
me. Five-toeds have been appear- 
ing in our population randomly — 
in decreasing numbers — for gen- 
erations. They can’t fit in at our 
present population density. Why 
would anyone but a psychotic take 
a bunch out of suspension?” 

Walter glowed with excitement. 
“Because Olga is returning.” Val 
started to sputter an objection and 
old Walter said, “Wait. Look at 
these sighting-patterns. The Buck- 
eyes are gathering at the major riv- 
er beds on all the continents. Re- 
member those tight-beam songs 
from the Outside? We will gather 
at the river? They expect Olga.” 

Val shook his head firmly. “No. 
Let’s not make a deity out of 
some renegade space station. The 
buckeyes are migrating because 
their astrologers all happen to 
agree. They read the same planets 
and signs so an agreement isn’t a 
miracle. I know that Venus and 
Mars are joining Jupiter in Sagit- 
tarius — very auspicious for some- 



thing; but not for Olga. That space 
station deserted two thousand 
three hundred and eighty years ago 
when the Big ES tried to have her 
dismantled. We needed her techs 
and mecks to improve life here on 
Earth and she turned her back. It 
figures that buckeyes would wor- 
ship her. They turned their backs 
on the Big ES too. But you and 
your Dabber friends are loyal citi- 
zens, Walter. Why would you wor- 
ship her — a machine?” 

“We know Olga is more than 
that,” Walter said quietly. “We 
honor Her memory because She 
cared for the individual man. She 
is our hope. She will come for us 
and take us to a better place where 
we can live in the old ways — natu- 
ral and pure.” 

The calm, patient answer made 
Val regret his sharp attack on the 
old man’s basic beliefs. After all, 
many good citizens were Dabbers 
and FOOs. He studied the charts 
trying to think of something cheer- 
ful to break the silence. 

“I guess you’re right, Walter. 
Look at these sighting/kill ratios. 
The buckeyes are being sighted 
more often all over the world — 
but no one is killing any.” 

“You’re joking.” 

“A little, maybe — but the five- 
toeds are getting protection from 
someone — or something.” 

The trial at Dundas Harbor con- 
cluded with the killer’s acquittal. 
His defense was the number of 
cured patients he had freed from 



SONG OF KAIA 



53 




suspension. Evidently the mega- 
jury feared suspension at least as 
much as death and were willing to 
take the incident at face value — 
pyrotherapy, not politics. 

“Verdict — freedom on the sur- 
face,” exclaimed Walter. 

“So? They’re all five-toeds. 
They belong on the Outside.” 

“But the crops.” 

“They’re way up in the Ever- 
green Sector. Let Evergreen worry 
about crop-crushers.” 

Walter felt drained. 

“I guess it’s over then. The trial 
— and the buckeyes migrating tell 
a story. All* the five-toeds will 
leave Orange^ector .” 

Val brightened. “That’s good. 
Our crops are safe and you and I 
can rest.” 



T inker and Mu Ren picked 
their way along the dry river- 
bed until they came to the pile of 
rocks that marked Hip’s shelter 
for the night. Ball sat high on one 
wall, singing to a group of weary 
nomads nesting nearby. 

“Are you sure we’re in the right 
riverbed? It seems so narrow,” said 
Tinker. 

Hip nodded toward Ball. I’m 
just following Ball. Apparently the 
headwaters of the Mississippi were 
around here somewhere. Conduits 
were added that ran from the ice 
cap or something. Anyway Ball is 
using the stars to get his bearings 
— we’ll be on target.” 



Tinker laid out their bedrolls 
and let Junior play with stones be- 
fore bedtime. It was going to be a 
bright starry night. 

The next morning they were sur- 
prized to see several hundred 
strange buckeyes had joined their 
throng — pilgrims from the Cotton 
White Sector in the southeast. As 
they journeyed up the river bank 
their numbers increased into the 
thousands. 



V AL was on the screen with 
Dundas Harbor. 

“That’s not our problem,’’ he 
was saying. 

Walter tuned in to hear Dundas 
say, “It is everyone’s problem. 
That army of buckeyes is going 
wherever it pleases. They’ve even 
invaded shaftcities. They might 
cross over into your sector next. 
No one is safe until they are 
stopped.” 

Walter changed the image to 
show midcontinent. The masses of 
buckeyes were concentrating just 
south of the 50:00 parallel and they 
had linked up with the 5-toed fu- 
gitives from Dundas Harbor. A 
chill went up Walter’s spine — sure- 
ly this was the work of Olga. He 
should be there; too — strong be- 
liever that he was. 

“Tell him we’ll send a platoon 
to help,” said Walter. 

Val studied the old man care- 
fully, then nodded and signed off. 
“How will you manage Hunter 



54 



IF 




Control alone, in your condition, 
if I take the whole platoon on a 
big hunt?” 

“I’m taking the platoon. I’m 
your senior.” 

Val smiled. No sense arguing. 
If the old man was strong enough 
to be on duty he could ride on a 
huntercraft. 

“All right, we’ll both go. Noth- 
ing to do around here now that the 
buckeyes are gone. I’ll get up to 
the garage and see how many craft 
are functioning. You put out a call 
to see how many of our loyal citi- 
zens have a Hunt due them.” 

Of the twenty dilapidated craft 
that started out less than half 
reached 50:00 on schedule. For Val 
it was to be the Armageddon; for 
Walter it was something else. 

It was night when Val and Wal- 
ter reached the hunting grounds. 
They were ordered to a position 
below the horizon from the buck- 
eye armies. They were ready to 
attack in the darkness before the 
dawn. 

Walter studied the screen view 
of the 5-toeds massed over a thir- 
ty-mile-wide area dotted with shaft 
caps and agromechs. The giant 
mechanical field workers had been 
commandeered by extracting their 
aerials so they’d be on voice-com- 
mand mode. 

‘‘Must be a million of them out 
there,” Val said, taking out his 
tool kit. 

‘‘Not quite,” Walter said. ‘‘And 
they look peaceful enough. What’s 



that they’re singing? I’m curious.” 

Waiter tied into the audio pick- 
up on one of the shaftcaps in the 
army’s midst. 

He motioned Val to silence. 
Song drifted to them. 

We will gather at the river — 

The beautiful, beautiful river — 

‘‘Just the geological memory 
of a river,” Walter said. 

‘‘There are no other kind on the 
planet now.” Val crawled out 
through the hatch. ‘‘I’ve got to 
polish some contacts or we won’t 
be going anywhere very fast. Let 
me know if anything happens.” 

While Val worked under the 
chassis he heard distant, muffled 
explosions. 

“What’s that?” he called. 

‘‘Just the commandeered agro- 
mechs exploding — tight-beam self- 
destruct signal,” Walter told him. 

Val looked at the scattered red 
glows on the horizon. “The Big ES 
doesn’t take any chances, does it?” 

Walter admired the faith and 
stability of the buckeyes. Even 
while the agromechs burned they 
returned to their chants and pray- 
ers, their voices swelling to a cre- 
scendo. 

Val worked on a gleaming con- 
tact point with his file. Something 
was changing. He could see better. 
The darkness under the Hunter- 
craft was vanishing. 

“What’s going on out there?” 
he called. 



SONG OF KAIA 



55 




Walter was silent. The night sky 
glowed. The voices quieted. 

“Hard thunder — hard thunder,” 
warned the Huntercraft as it 
slammed its hatches. 

The viewscreen rippled as the 
sonic boom crashed down. Val was 
about to shout when it hit — bounc- 
ing him around under the craft in 
a bath of dancing pebbles. His ears 
rang but he heard nothing. He 
tried to crawl but another boom 
hit, bouncing the huntercraft a few 
inches. The machine came to rest 
pressing on Val’s ankle. Bright 
flashes lit the sky and the craft 
danced off his ankle again. He 
screamed in the silence of deaf- 
ness. 

A s he lay there spitting grit 
he felt a shock wave travel un- 
der him. He saw several Hunter- 
craft take off crazily, only to crash 
immediately. 

Later he struggled to his feet 
and leaned against the fender. He 
carefully wiped the dust out of his 
eyes and ears. As his senses re- 
turned he found that all he could 
hear was his own movement. The 
landscape looked frightening in 
the black-and-white of dawn. He 
saw no lights. Nothing moved. All 
the Huntercraft sat silent and 
dark. Smoke curled up from the 
damaged agromechs. All the buck- 
eyes were gone. He pulled open the 
hatch and climbed into the dark 
cabin. The viewscreen and panel 
lights were out. 



“Walter— you all right?” he 
called. 

Walter sat gazing into a blank 
screen — transfixed. Val sat down 
and rubbed his sore ankle. 

“A miracle,” Walter muttered 
at length. 

Val did not comment. He took 
his seat at the controls and 
checked the power cell. Overload- 
ed. He closed everything down for 
a few minutes, then opened up the 
lines one by one. The panel lit up. 
Glancing through the port he saw 
a crew trying to right an over- 
turned craft. Scattered groups of 
hunters could be seen milling 
around their silent machines.' His 
viewscreen focused on the hunting 
ground. It confirmed what he had 
known — the buckeyes were gone. 
Only an occasional body lay next 
to a burning agromech where it 
had been caught when the power 
cell blew. He tried the fine focus. 
There were peculiar pock marks — 
craters — all over. 

“What happened?” he asked. 

Bird Dog said, “Memory units 
are blank — wiped clean by electrP- 
mag and shock waves. I am check- 
ing with the class one for an ex- 
planation.” 

Walter took a deep breath and 
sighed. “Didn’t you hear her?” 

“Whom?” 

“Olga. Her voice came over the 
communicator just before she 
took her people up,” Walter said, 
still awe struck. 

Val didn’t like the colors on 



56 



IF 




Walter’s face. Walter was white 
and had dark rims around his eyes 
and mouth — domino mask cya- 
nosis. If Olga was Walter’s god 
She may have come for his soul. 

The class one said, “C.O. here. 
What’s going on out there?” 

“I was hoping you could ans- 
wer that,” said Val. 

“Can you get closer with your 
sensors? Whatever it was hit the 
five major continents at the same 
time. Blanked out everything in 
the area. Even got some of the 
shaftcity brains. Lot of data are 
missing.” 

Val glanced at Walter. The om- 
inous domino mask was fading. 
The old fat face had pinked up a 
little. Reaching for the manual 
overrides, Val nudged the craft 
forward. It moved. 

As he started for the hunting 
ground he asked the C.O. hesi- 
tantly, “Did you record anything 
before the — ah — disturbance?” 

“Such as?” asked the C.O. 

“Voices. A voice that identified 
itself as Olga.” 

Walter wheezed into the con- 
versation: “Play back her voice. 
Please. I want to hear her speak 
again — of the flaming chariot and 
the children of Olga.” 

Val flew on into the hunting 
ground, intent on finding a logical 
explanation. The world’s central 
meek brain gathered snatches of 
recorded conversations from pick- 
ups all over the globe and simula- 
ted a message: 



By the fiery wheels of Ezekiel 
and the flaming chariot of Elias 
will the children of Olga be de- 
livered from the hunters arrows 
to dwell in their rightful place 
among the stars in the heav- 
ens . 

Val shuddered, rationalizing that 
the singsong must have been one 
of the buckeye prayers triggered 
by the fireworks in the sky — what- 
ever they were. He set the craft 
down by a crater. 

VIII 

T he ground was strewn with 
Stone-Age weapons and 
crushed vegetable debris. The cra- 
ter itself consisted of a rim of syn- 
thesoil torn back, exposing the 
metaloid skin of a shaftcity. Con- 
duits and cubicles cluttered the 
bottom of the crater and between 
them yawned the black, bottom- 
less ’tween walls which, Val knew, 
dropped nearly a mile to shaft 
base. The air contained smoke 
from singed crops and the explod- 
ed agromechs. Val bent over and 
sifted through the spongy, rug- 
like synthesoil. It was still warm. 

The next crater was larger, near- 
ly forty yards in diameter. Fetid 
steam rose from the punctured 
city. He met another hunter, hel- 
meted and suited like himself, sift- 
ing through the debris of a buck- 
eyes campfire. His spec bottle con- 
tained small bone fragments, some 



SONG OF KAIA 



57 




of which bore teeth marks. Hu- 
man bones. At the next crater Val 
climbed down and stood on the 
buckled skin of the city. He ex- 
plored the soil and found strange 
rocky fragments and glassy beads. 
He was certain they didn’t belong 
in the man-made soil. Some of the 
rocky pieces were as large as his 
fist and still hot. He reported his 
finding and soon other hunters 
were collecting similar objects. By 
dusk agromechs were back on the 
scene, filling the craters and cul- 
tivating the soil. Val and Walter 
rounded up their craft and started 
the long journey back to Orange 
Sector. 

The H.C. meek welcomed them 
back to Hunter Control with a 
negative log. No sightings during 
their absence. The buckeyes were 
gone. 

Val sorted through his spec bot- 
tle — charred bone, wood and the 
rocky /glassy material. He called 
the lab tech for an analysis. 

“It was a miracle. Simply a mir- 
acle.’’ said Walter. 

“What does the C.O. say?” 
asked Val. 

The tech answered him: “Tek-. 
tite shower. Meteors entering the 
atmosphere would produce the 
light and sounds. The electromag 
effect was out of line with the 
plasma produced but otherwise 
everything fits — down to the cra- 
ter size and tektites.” 

“Can you run detailed analyses 
on these?” 



The tech looked puzzled. “Sure. 
I suppose. I have gear I could bor- 
row from the central lab. It would 
take a few weeks to get it opera- 
ting. How soon do you need it?” 
“Take as long as you need,” 
said Val. “If they’re real tektites, 
then all the buckeyes are still 
somewhere in the Big ES. 1 sup- 
pose their astrologers could have 
gathered them together in prepara- 
tion for the meteor shower — me- 
teors and planetary positions could 
go together — but it’s hard to be- 
lieve that they would have all been 
frightened into the shaftcities by 
the fireworks. The census data is 
scrambled in those local cities but 
we should be picking them up any- 
way — with their stature and skin 
pigmentation.” 

Walter interrupted: “They were 
children of Olga — the five-toeds. 
She took them with Her into the 
Heavens.” 

Val sneered. 

“Don’t you believe in a deity?” 
asked Walter. 

“I have an open mind — but if 
Olga is a deity, why doesn’t She 
help the average citizen. We could 
certainly use a little more space 
and more calories.” 

Walter nodded sadly. “Those 
were my ideas, too, when I was 
young. I guess that is why She 
didn’t take me with Her. I’d lost 
Faith. Now I realize why She 
doesn’t help all mankind.” 

“Why?” 

“She isn’t omnipotent. She only 



58 



IF 




had room for the chosen few— 
the five-toed. But I’m sure She’ll 
be back some day.” 

Val shrugged and said, “Why 
pay homage to a god who may 
not have room for you when you 
can pay homage to the Hive and 
have calories and quarters to show 
fork?” 

Walter turned quietly to his 
console — praying for Val’s soul. 

T hree growing seasons passed 
without a single buckeye sight- 
ing. Walter retired and Val was 
transferred to the Watcher com- 
mittee in charge of suicides. 

“The psychokinetoscope has de- 
tected psychotic Fine Body Move- 
ments on level seventy-two,” an- 
nounced the viewscreen. 

“Alert shaft base and get Secur- 
ity to level seventy-two,” shouted 
Val, running for the spiral. 

The apathetic crowd at shaft 
base ignored the siren, and the 
sluggish Security squad milled 
around on level 70. Val arrived on 
72 first and glanced over the crowd 
for the I. A. Hundreds of citizens 
sauntered or stood about in their 
usual lethargic state. He checked 
his belt communicator for an op- 
tic record — female, V^CEEB (sec- 
ond subculturje, Chi Epidermal cell 
from the Esther Bemis clone) Pu- 
berty plus eight. The readout con- 
tinued but he was distracted by a 
furtive movement in a crawlway. 

“Stop,” he shouted as she 
dashed toward the rail. 



Val made a dive for her but she 
was moving too fast. He felt the 
light material of her issue tissue 
flip through his fingers. Then he 
hit the rail hard. She was sailing 
down with her arms out like a 
bird. 

He sat down rubbing his bruised ; 
rib. Then he glanced at the rest of 
the report on ViCEEB. It was the 
usual: unauthorized pregnancy, 

child sent to the digester; then the 
Big ES issued her a birth permit 
to pass on her obedience gene — 
a birth permit earned by the mur- 
der of her first born. Ironic. Val 
checked her quarters. He knew 
what he’d find — a nest. ViCEEB 
had been a part of a family-7 but 
recently had nested with one of the 
males. Their nest consisted of his 
personal cubicle decorated with 
rugs, drapes and cushions sewn 
from issue tissue. Val patted the 
drape over the door. A cloud of 
dust billowed. 

“Enough ectodermal debris to 
sensitize anyone,” he said.. 

Four of the family-7 were at* 
home. They had heard the jump- 
er’s scream. They knew. 

V AL dropped in on Walter at 
change of shift. He mentioned 
the jumper. 

Walter commented: “I know the 
family you’re talking about. Six 
old men in their late twenties — and 
the female. She was puberty plus 
seven or eight I think. They had 



SONG OF KAIA 



59 




been on calorie basic a long time, 
saving credits for the baby. They 
enjoyed the melds — seven plus a 
fraction souls. Too bad.” 

“Jumping is still inappropriate. 
She had the new permit. All she 
had to do was start another preg- 
nancy. It would have been author- 
ized. A tech would take out her 
anti-ov capsule and there’d be a 
Medi-attendant for the delivery.” 
“Yes,” agreed old Walter. “I 
guess the nesting does contribute. 
What was her gamma A?” 

“Around eighty mgs— just 
where I expected.” 

Dee Pen had been listening in si- 
lence. “That’s sad,” she said. 

Val snorted. “The gamma A 
gene is a bad gene. The Big ES is 
better off without it.” 

Walter objected mildly. “But 
the gamma A once was an impor- 
tant gene for mankind.” 

“Oh?” 

“It is the gene that enables us 
to make antibodies against ecto- 
dermal debris — the nest factor. It 
is the gene that makes us intoler- 
ant to crowding.” 

Val interrupted. “The antihive 
gene. Keeps the five-toeds out of 
the Hive. But what’s good about 
it?” 

“Nothing in the big ES. It’s fa- 
tal here. But in the distant past 
when there was exploring to do — 
who went? Those with the highest 
titre against ectodermal debris. 
Which children left the nest first 
to make their way in the world? 



The high titres. Only now, in the 
hive of the Big ES, is it a problem. 
Big ES is so structured that you 
can’t leave the nest — so you can’t 
nest.” 

Val opened his mouth to say 
something but he hesitated — think- 
ing. Like a useless fifth toe, the 
buckeye gene also carried the 
gamma A antibody system. What 
else was there? Neurohumoral 
autonomies for overreacting — and 
— He shuddered. Man had cer- 
tainly evolved through some re- 
pulsive stages in his evolution to 
reach the cooperative, friendly 4- 
toed hive citizen. 

Val walked to the door. “No, 
you can’t nest in the Hive — thank 
Olga for that.” 

After he left Walter muttered. 
“Olga had very little to do with 
it.” 

Dee Pen walked over to Walter 
and looked deeply into his old, 
tired eyes. 

“Were times so bad when we 
were five-toed creatures?” she 
asked. “The running, swimming 
and tree-climbing sound stimula- 
ting.” 

“There was more.” 

“Nesting?” 

He nodded. “And more. There 
was the sharing of the planet with 
other life forms — the birds, fish 
and warm blooded animals. Men’s 
souls are more stable when sur- 
rounded by souls of other spe- 
cies.” 

She nodded.

K AIA, the last 5-toed hominid 
in Orange, awaited death stoi- 
cally. Crippled by the hunter’s 
trophy knife and the heavy burden 
of age, he had been unable to 
make the Trek to the River. From 
his niche in the mountain he had 
watched them leave — some his kin, 
others strangers — but all noble 
Five-Toed In-Betweens. He knew 
that he was alone, for the Hunter- 
craft no longer patrolled and 
weedy vines climbed the towers, 
fouling the buckeye detectors. 

He hobbled about openly in the 
gardens, nibbling kumquat, citron 
and cran. A passing agromech 
waved. He smiled as his sat in the 
sun to nap. 

G ITAR sang in the mountains. 

He sang by the sea. He sang 
in the gardens — a place no human 
would be. He sang in a shaftcap. 
Twelve followed him Outside. 
They were only Nebishes. At sun- 
up they died. 

V AL scratched his head. A doz- 
en flowers baked in the sun? 
Brain samples at Neuro ran nega- 
tive for both I.A. and M.R. A new 
syndrome? He ran a cross check on 
other unexplained flowers and saw 
a pattern emerging. Although su- 
icides due to I.A. diluted the sta- 
tistics, there had been a series of 
citizen groups going flower — Out- 
side to die. Their bodies had been 
found on their first days out — 
peeling and baking in the solar ac- 



tinics — and Neuro could find no 
evidence of inappropriate activity. 
The gamma-A nest factor was not 
present on the serotonin sites of 
their neurones. He had these new 
flowers projected to the wall map. 
The reaction was clustered along 
a fairly straight line that was head- 
ed for this sector. 

He called Walter. 

“Found a new kind of flower.” 
he said over the screen. 

“New?” 

“Neither I.A. or M.R. and it 
occurs in clusters.” Val studied 
the old man’s face. The gray dom- 
ino mask of cyanosis had returned. 

“Clusters of flowers,” mur- 
mured Walter. His mind wan- 
dered around blank pools of an- 
oxia and sorted memory mole- 
cules. He remembered the clus- 
tering at the river and his pulse 
raced. Could the hand of Olga be 
in this? 

Val continued: “Usually the 
flower reaction hits an individual 
citizen randomly. He goes out to 
commune alone with the sun. This 
new reaction hits groups. We end 
up with a cluster of scorched 
bodies. And the flower clusters are 
headed this way. Should be hitting 
our shaftcities soon.” 

“Headed this way?” asked Wal- 
ter. “Olga is coming back for

me. 



G ITAR placed his flat, oval, 
two-foot resonance shield on

the ground and raised his three- 
foot, tubular body upright, so his 
knoblike head of sensors could 
scan while he slept and rested his 
Q bottle. For several days he 
stood there like a parking meter, 
being alternately drenched and 
covered by agrifoam. Green 
sprouts fuzzed the soil and the 
bulky Tillers carefully avoided 
stepping on him. 

On the fifth day he activated his 
walking field — cooling the cryo- 
gel and feeding current to the pea- 
nut magnet. As the powerful sand- 
wich field took shape under him 
he sputtered charged particles be- 
tween the layers of the field to 
harden it. Then he lifted his body 
a few feet off the soil and floated 
quickly along — laying his body 
down on his shield in his more usu- 
al guitar-shape. Sensors seeking, 
he entered the valley where Kaia 
languished. 

I was born on a wandering star, 

Youve heard my name. Vm

I came to Earth to find man- 
kind. 

ril search canal and spiral 
wind. 

Kaia lifted his shaggy gray head 
and watched the singing machine 
approach. It landed and assumed 
its parking-meter posture. Col- 
ored geometries rippled on its 
skin. 

Kaia lifted his hand in a weak 



greeting. Gitar played restful 
soothing tunes. Adjusting the roll- 
ing base to 200 hertz to match the 
resonance of the air/water inter- 
face of Kaia’s lung; Gitar trans- 
mitted the harmonic waves to 
Kaia’s vagus nerve. The throb of 
rhythm matched the throb of 
Kaia’s heartbeat. Kaia relaxed, 
smiled and tapped his fingers on 
the large melon under his arm. Gi- 
tar played-on, sensors assessing 
his control over the aging abor- 
igine. 

Entrainment set in. The music 
activated subcortical neuronat sys- 
tems in Kaia’s brain and modified 
the pacing by the brain of his car- 
diovascular, endocrine, metabolic, 
neurological and reproductive 
functions. Volume increased to 
120 decibels and Gitar added 
words to his audiogenic stimula- 
tion. 

He mates and runs and then he 
lives alone. 

He eats red meat and marrow 
from the bone. 

As Kaia’s autonomic tone in- 
creased he felt his strength return- 
ing. His metabolism quickened 
and his respiratory quotients ap- 
proached 1.0. But he remain^ 
there, reclining on the melon. Gi- 
tar’s words became more personal. 
Why should he die this year? Why 
not live one more season — mate 
and run once more? Or twice 
more? Why not?

IF 




“But there are no more mates,” 
said Kaia. 

“Females can be found in shaft- 
city,” suggested Gitar. 

“Nebishes?” 

“Some reach puberty spontan- 
eously and polarize their genders 
to female — one in a thousand — or 
one in a million. But they are 
there.” 

Kaia stood up weakly. 

IX 

B usch walked through the qui- 
et garage. Only two of the ag- 
romechs were active today. The 
others sat quietly at their energy 
sockets. After the active ones left 
for the fields he just sat in front of 
the viewscreen — bored. Being a 
companion/monitor to recharging 
mecks was an easy way to earn 
flavored calories. Easy — until to- 
day. 

At dusk the two mecks re- 
turned. They were flecked with 
dust and plant juices. The door 
stood open as the bulky machines 
maneuvered into their bays. Then 
a chill raised the small hairs on 
Busch’s neck. One of the agro- 
mechs had a flower in its fender. 
A blossom neatly plucked with a 
long stem and carefully inserted 
into one of the lift-holes on the 
fender. Of course the meek could 
have done it with its fine manipu- 
lators — but it took a protoplas- 
mic brain to think of it — a 5-toed 
brain. 



“Door!” he shouted. “Shut, 
Door, shut — ” 

The door closed quietly. Busch 
sighed and wiped his forehead. 
Then he heard something stirring 
inside the weed hopper of the large 
agromech. A shaggy gray head ap- 
peared. Busch turned to run for 
the spiral exit, but he was much 
too slow. 



V AL confronted the bulky agro- 
mech. “A buckeye? You’re 
certain it was a five-toed buck- 
eye?” 

The meek agitated its sensors. 
“You’ve seen the optic records.” 
“And you allowed him to hunt 
in the garage?” 

The meek was silent. The direc- 
tive was plain enough. Machines 
do not choose sides, do not dis- 
criminate, do not take an active 
part in hominid conflicts. Val con- 
tinued to insult the meek’s class- 
eight intelligence. Finally the ma- 
chine spoke — assuming a superior, 
detached manner. 

“I do my job, sir; and 1 try to 
be objective when I witness the sor- 
did activities of you protoplasmic 
creatures. If one of you eats an- 
other, I try to understand. But it 
is hard, admittedly, for I’ve never 
known protein starvation.” 

Val boiled for a few minutes, 
then collected himself. He remem- 
bered his conflict with the hunter- 
craft that had refused to let him 
shoot from the cabin. It was im- 



SONGOF KAIA 



63 




possible to get these machines ac- 
tively involved in injuring humans 
of any sort. Their job descriptions 
were too clear. 

Val went back and studied 
Busch's remains. The killer had 
been a buckeye, for certain. It 
would have taken one of those 
brutes to draw and quarter Busch 
like that. Only the right hind quar- 
ter was missing — so there had 
probably been only one killer. 

Val asked Watcher to reacti- 
vate Hunter Control but got the 
same argument as before — with 
jumpers hitting shaft base at three 
per-day-per-city, no funds were 
available for huntercraft unless the 
crops were in danger. And one 
lone buckeye in the entire Orange 
Sector was not a danger. 

“What you do on your own 
time is your business, of course,” 
soothed Watcher. 

Val walked through H.C. ga- 
rage. The meek brain had been as- 
signed elsewhere. All was quiet. 
The panels were dark. Dust and 
cobwebs covered the Huntercraft. 

Val patted Bird Dog’s gritty 
fender. “Could have used you to- 
day,” he said.. He went to his old 
office. It was heaped with refuse. 
Someone was already using the 
rooms for storage. He found a 
case of arrows and a longbow and 
went to visit old Walter. 

“You’d better get a permit if 
you’re going to carry those wea- 
pons around inside the city,” said 
Walter. Foamy sputum flecked 



the corners of his mouth and his 
feet were swollen. 

“Watcher said he’d take care of 
it for me.” Val shrugged. “I’m 
going to take the tubeways to the 
next flower cluster. They’re on the 
same line on my map.” 

Walter started to cough and 
bubble. Val helped him to sit up 
and propped pillows under his 
head. The wet beri-beri had him 
good this time. Fluids were accu- 
mulating. From the umbilicus 
down he resembled a bag of wa- 
ter with only the rough outline of 
the man still discernible. Dee Pen 
spent a lot of time sitting beside 
his cot and holding his hand. 

When he caught his breath 
again Walter said, “You’re taking 
this thing about Busch pretty seri- 
ously. Why?” 

Val stiffened. “It’s not Busch. 
It’s those flower clusters. My job 
is dead citizens— bodies and their 
prevention. The suicide I. A. we 
understand. With a psychokineto- 
scope and a bucket of mud we can 
save a few. We also understand 
the bad M.R. drug reactions. If it 
gets out-of-hand all we have to do 
is turn off the supply of Molecular 
Reward. This flower clustering 
bothers me. If it becomes epidem- 
ic, we could have all the citizens 
running Outside at the same time 
and trampling the crops — and dy- 
ing in the actinics.” 

“Maybe it’s Olga’s way of 
cleansing the planet of the four- 
toeds and starting over.” 



64 



IF 




He was interrupted by neutral 
Arthur. 

“We have an applicant to fill 
Busch’s place in our family^ Wal- 
ter. Would you like to meet her?” 
Arthur asked softly. 

Val and Walter turned toward 
the doorway to see one of the 
most beautiful females they had 
ever seen. She was almost as tall 
as a coweye and just as well 
formed. Finely sculpted nose and 
chin, long eyelashes and bright 
eyes were framed by a full head 
of flowing black hair. She smiled 
as she took a dainty step into the 
sickroom and opened her flowing 
tunic, exposing pink curves — large 
symmetrical breasts tipped by 
prominent areolas — long narrow 
waist and plump buttocks. A faint 
horizontal scar marked her lower 
abdomen. She closed her tunic, 
curtsied and returned to the door- 
way. Val swallowed. 

“Is she okay with you?” asked 
Arthur. After the silence dragged 
on he^added: “She has a job.” 

Walter nodded weakly. 

“Oh, thank you, thank you.” 
she said effusively and ran to his 
bedside to touch his hand. “I just 
know I’ll relate well in the meld. 
Your family is just what I’ve been 
looking for.” She paused and low- 
ered her eyes coyly. “As you can 
see. I’m one of the augmented 
Venus models contracted for by 
Entertainment. I have good jobs 
on the channels and will bring 
home many flavors.” 



Walter nodded slowly. “Glad 
to have, Venus.” 

Her smile faded as she studied 
Walter’s face — the transverse fis- 
sures at the angles of the mouth, 
pink vascular eyes and flaking skin 
around the nose. 

“Please open your mouth,” she 
asked. 

He showed her a magenta 
tongue. 

She looked at his swollen, limp 
legs. 

“Lost the feeling in your legs?” 

He nodded. 

“Hands tingle and burn?” 

He nodded again. She smiled 
and patted his cheek. 

“I’ve got just the thing for you.” 

Going to the dispenser she iden- 
tified herself and ordered a thick 
bowl of whole grain barley soup. 
The flavor aroma filled the room. 
She handed it to Dee Pen to feed 
to Walter. 

“We’re family now,” she said. 
“My flavors can feed your enzyme 
systems.” 

V AL labored in Psych, mostly 
mopping up the stains left by 
jumpers. He watched Venus and 
Dee Pen pour barley and yeast in- 
to Walter until the old man start- 
ed wiggling his toes again. 

The next buckeye sighting was 
on the dark continent. Val packed 
his insulated hunting gear and 
enough staples for three days and 
headed for the tubeways. His Sa- 
gittarius rank — although inactive 



SONG OF KAIA

— would get him there and back. 

The trip was beautiful once he 
got used to the squeeze of the 
crowd. Three of the five undersea 
conduits were operating and he ran 
into little delay. The sea was bright 
and clear. He gazed through the 
walls as he shot along. On the reefs 
and shelves he saw a few empty 
bubble buildings. The only signs of 
life were occasional tags of brown 
algae clinging to the otherwise bar- 
ren rocks. Nothing moved. 

He changed tubes several times 
to reach the city mentioned in the 
buckeye sighting. Dropping in on 
the local Watcher, he checked the 
details. Yes, there was a sighting. 
No, it wasn’t a buckeye; it was a 
coweye — and she was still in the 
gardens — eating. 

The Watcher, a withered old 
man of twenty-seven, helped Van 
unpack. 

“I wouldn’t be too anxious to 
get out there and face her if I were 
you. Sonny,” he said. 

“Why?” 

“She’s a big ’un.” 

Val sat down and reviewed the 
optic playbacks of the sighting. 
She was big. She looked younger 
and bigger than the one he had en- 
countered when he was chasing 
Tinker. But he was confident. 

“I can handle her,” he said. 
“One shot from this and she’ll fall 
right into reflex hibernation. An 
easy kill no matter where I hit 
her.” 

Watcher scratched his chin. 



“Reflex hibernation? Can’t say 
I’ve ever heard of that before.” 
“Come along and watch on the 
remote.” 

W ITH his helmet on step-down 
the garden was all grays and 
blacks. He hardly felt the blister- 
ing sun through his heavy closed- 
environment suit. With his bow 
ready he slowly pushed his way 
through the vegetation toward the 
quarry indicated on the scope. He 
was about a mile away but he 
moved cautiously. At two hundred 
yards he paused. She was sitting 
on the opposite side of a patch of 
low berry bushes. No cover. He 
started working his way around 
the patch, staying in the taller 
grains. A small agromech danced 
about the berry bushes, making 
distracting sounds. At fifty yards 
he had his chance. Through a 
screen of delicate mint leaves he 
could take careful aim and prob- 
ably get off two shots before she 
knew what was happening. He 
stood his second arrow feathers-up 
and set his feet. The first arrow 
was still in the air and he was re- 
nocking the second. Too high. She 
jumped up and turned to run. The 
second arrow struck her solidly in 
the back. He stepped out expecting 
her to hibernate. The arrow dan- 
gled from the muscle mass over 
the left scapula. The impact had 
sounded like.he had hit solid wood. 
She reached around with her right 
hand and pulled out the arrow. He 



66 



IF 




fumbled for his third arrow but she 
was rushing him and he dropped 
the case. With his heavy suit he 
felt he was dream-running. He 
drew his trophy knife — but she hit 
him like an agromech running over 
a melon. His forearm and two ribs 
snapped as he bounced off her 
heavy frame. 

When he regained consciousness 
he was on fire. All he could see 
were the bright red markings of his 
retinal vessels against a flowing 
orange background. He was on his 
back under the sun and his suit and 
helmet were gone. Screaming, he 
tried to roll over, but his right arm 
flapped, broken. He threw his left 
forearm over his eyes to protect 
them. The darkness was reassur- 
ing. The blazing heat was rapidly 
blistering and peeling his skin. He 
struggled to sit up — screaming 
again and again. Abruptly it be- 
came cold and dark as a squad of 
nervous attendants threw a wet 
blanket over him. One quickly fas- 
tenecl a balloon splint to his right 
arm and painfully inflated it. Then 
they rolled him face down on a 
stretcher and jogged him back to 
the shaftcap. 

Inside, they dressed his eyes with 
thick bandages and pounded a pin 
into his right ulna to stabilize the 
bone fragments. Then icy grease 
was smeared over his burning skin 
and he was left alone. 

A hand touched his shoulder 
tentatively. He heard Watcher’s 
old voice ask, “Drink?” 



“No. Not right now.” Val was 
too sick to be thirsty. “What 
about my eyes?” 

“Medi- attendant says they won’t 
know for a day or so.” 

The stretcher was lifted and he 
felt the to-and-fro motion of being 
carried. He cursed to himself. Of 
all the rotten luck ! 

As if in answer to his thoughts 
he heard Watcher cackle. “You 
were certainly lucky she wasn’t 
hungry. She’s a cannibal, you 
know.” 

His sight returned overnight and 
he reviewed the optics. The hit was 
solid but it didn’t penetrate her 
heavy scapula — calcium and col- 
lagen. She didn’t hibernate, be- 
cause she was a degree or two 
warmer already in her follicular 
phase. She had used his trophy 
knive to cut off his helmet and 
suit. She was being careful not to 
cut him. Her behavior on the play- 
back puzzled him for a moment. 
Then he realized that she was fon- 
dling him, trying to copulate. It 
was her folliculafr phase and she 
was probably the last of her kind 
on the continent. 

K AIA sat with Gitar on a heap 
of refuse and sang to a small 
circle of white Nebish faces in the 
agromech garage. Nebish citizens 
were lured upspiral by the hypnotic 
music. The rolling base at 100 
hertz quickly entrained their au- 
tonomies locking their respiration, 
pulse and cephalic rhythms togeth-

er. At 160 decibels Gitar sang of 
things 5-toed — violent passion 
freedoms and individual strengths. 
Kaia’s gravelly voice joined in. 

Olga awaits her Jive-toed men. 

Where they can walk the stars 
again. 

. Shell take us to her Wandering 
Star, 

Mankind, his genes, and me — 
Gitar. 

Twelve Nebishes followed Gitar 
Outside that night, but they clus- 
tered, wilted and died like rootless 
flowers in the next day’s sun. None 
survived to run on the green; for 
they lacked the buckeye’s 5-toed 
gene. 

V AL limped into Walter’s quar- 
ters and sat down carefully. 
Venus fussed over his scabby face 
and right-arm splint. He accepted 
her offer of a beverage and turned 
to Walter. 

“Just got off the tube. It’s good 
to be back.” 

“Learn anything?” asked Wal- 
ter. 

Val smiled. “Never hunt a cow- 
eye during the follicular phase.” 
Walter snickered and then broke 
out into a loud guffaw. He had 
been reclining on his cot with the 
same four pillows as before but 
when he sat up and put his feet 
over the side of the bed — laughing 
— Val realized that he was just 
napping, not dying. 



Venus came in with a tray of 
drinks and felt left out of the joke. 
Walter was unable to get out more 
than two words between laughs. 

G itar and Kaia approached 
another shaftcap. Kaia’s high 
protein diet had strengthened his 
body. He was searching for a 
mate. Gitar opened the doors and 
they went to the platform at the 
top of the shaft. Kaia stood back 
while Gitar focused his woofer 
downshaft and started to play. Of 
the tens of thousands who heard 
only a score lifted their heads. On- 
ly one climbed upspiral. It was Dee 
Pen. 

Gitar spoke with drums, and 
cymbals and strings. 

He spoke of nesting, of love 
and good things. 

He praised the free life, on 
top of the ground. 

This set her to dancing, and 
rocking around. 

Then Kaia with a knife, her 
arm he cut deep. 

He held and caressed her, and 
loved her to sleep. 

X 

T he lab tech calling about the 
meteor analysis sounded excit- 
ed, so Val hurried. Level eighteen 
housed most of the city’s special 
services. He walked past huge vats 
in the biosynthe section. He no- 
ticed a strong sulfur odor in the 



68 



IF 




amino acid section where the en- 
zymologists were trying to push 
the methionine reaction. The tech 
appeared a little apprehensive at 
first. 

“Sir? You remember the speci- 
mens you brought back from the 
hunt at 50:00?” 

“Of course.” 

“We studied them in three stag- 
es. Stage one showed that they 
were indeed carbonaceous chon- 
drites. This means that their origin 
could have been lunar or earth. 
They contained the peculiar gran- 
ules, the chondrules — and they can 
occur in showers. Deep space 
nickle-iron fragments weren’t sub- 
mitted; however their presence in a 
shower would still be okay.” 

“Stage two involved examina- 
tion for solar gases. We collected 
the gasses at different tempera- 
tures. The fraction between eight 
hundred and one thousand degrees 
was analyzed for the rare gases of 
helium, neon, argon, xenon and 
krypton. Their ratios were charac- 
teristic for solar gases in that the 
Kr/Xe ratio was over four. Gases 
in our atmosphere have a different 
ratio.” 

Val studied the printouts. “So it 
looks like a real meteor that has 
been in deep space.” 

“Until today,” said the tech. 
“Today we started measuring the 
cosmogenic radionuclides by gam- 
ma ray spectrometric techniques — 
these are the heavy isotopes that 
result from neutron capture. The 



easiest to work with is cobalt-six- 
ty. The ratio of cobalt-sixty /co- 
balt-fifty-nine can be used to de- 
termine the preatmospheric ex- 
posure age and the minimum ra- 
dius for the meteor.” 

Val nodded. “The longer the 
meteor is in space the more neu- 
trons it captures and the higher the 
ratio of the heavy isotope — right?” 
“Right. Only the ratio was the 
same as on Earth. If the meteor 
had been in space at all, its stay 
was too brief to affect the isotope 
contents. We checked sodium, 
aluminum, and manganese too. 
No increase in radionucleids.” 

Val still didn’t understand why 
the tech was concerned. “So we 
have a young meteor?” 

The tech raised his voice. “Do 
you know the size of an astro- 
blem it ^ould take to produce a 
shower of this size? Hudson Bay! 
Most of the specimens of chon- 
drites I could find in the old lab 
measured in the millions of years 
— geological time. Your meteors, 
as near as 1 can tell, originated on 
earth in recent historical times. 
Do you think history would forget 
an impact the size of Hudson 
Bay?” 

The tech grinned and produced 
a globe with each impact site dot- 
ted in red. “And look at this pat- 
tern. The blue dots are buckeye 
camps on the night of the shower. 
The red dots are crater sites the 
next morning. Pretty good guid- 
ance system.”

“Impossible.” said Val. 

“The clustering is impossible,” 
said the tech. 

Val’s mind flashed back to the 
incipient lemming reaction he had 
been worrying about — the flower 
clustering. 

“Do you suspect something 
other than natural forces in this 
shower?” he asked. 

“I was about to ask you the 
same thing. If an intelligence is 
behind this, it must be benevo- 
lent.” 

“Why?” 

“The crater size. None of them 
really penetrated a city. Statisti- 
cally very suspicious. I counted 
optic records of over eleven thou- 
sand craters — all thirty yards in 
diameter plus or minus ten yards. 
Each* one looked natural enough 
by itself — but taken together they 
all look artificial.” 

Val stared at the reports for a 
long moment. Then he thanked 
the tech and hurried back to show 
Walter. 

“Here’s your miracle. It was 
just a hoax. Do you think a deity 
would overlook something as ba- 
sic as cosmogenic radionucleids 
when putting together a tektite 
shower?” 

Walter glanced over the reports 
while his mind — sharper now on 
the high-thiamin, high-riboflavin 
diet supplied by Venus — schemed. 
He could see Olga’s hand in it all. 
The clues were so obvious to him 
— and now the (flustering. 



He looked Val in the eye and 
spoke seriously. “Perhaps Olga 
couldn’t make perfect tektites be- 
cause she is a deity with a small d. 
Not omnipotent. Or perhaps she 
left out the radionucleids on pur- 
pose — as a clue for the curious — 
a clue to those with the five-toed 
gene.” 

Val chuckled. “That is really 
egocentric. You’re suggesting that 
Olga staged the shower to mask 
her presence from the Big ES — 
but she makes little errors for you 
and me to detect.” 

“The Big ES was pretty quick 
to recultivate the craters. It took 
an inquiring individual to track 
this down.” 

Val shrugged. “With your kind 
of logic you can explain any- 
thing.” 

Venus brought in Walter’s B- 
complex tray. There was a sweet 
for Val to nibble on. 

“Staying for the meld?” 

“With my scabby skin. No. 
Maybe after I grow a little more 
skin and loose some of these 
crusts.” 

“Next time, then. That’s a 
promise?” 

He nodded as he left. 

Later Dee Pen stumbled into the 
living area — stunned, disheveled 
and matted. The vegetable fiber 
and red dust told Walter where 
she had been and the dried blood 
on her left arm told him what she 
had been doing. 

“Nesting?” he asked angrily. 



70 



IF 




“Yes.” She burst into tears. “I 
don’t know what came over me. A 
buckeye came to the shaft cap. He 
played music. We danced. I was in 
love for a while.” 

He put his arm around her 
trembling shoulder. The clustering 
phenomenon had hit their city too. 

“Everything will be all right,” 
he said. 

V AL collected playbacks from 
the agromechs who had wit- 
nessed the rape of Dee Pen. 
Watcher studied them. 

“Doesn’t look much like rape,” 
he muttered. “Looks a lot like a 
family-two meld with music.” 

Val nodded. 

“Have we received any play- 
backs from those shaftcaps where 
the flower clustering occurred?” 
asked Watcher. 

“Right here.” Val activated the 
screen. 

They watched the aborigine with 
his guitar lure citizens into the ga- 
rage and set them into a frenzy — 
and then lure them Outside to 
their deaths. 

“Same music,” commented the 
Watcher. 

“So far I’ve credited that buck- 
eye with the deaths of over two 
hundred citizens and a dozen 
rapes,” grumbled Val. 

“Can’t you predict where he’ll 
strike next and have Security 
there?” 

Val projected a map. “No. He 
sometimes covers up to fifty miles 



a day. With the cities only a mile 
or so apart that puts close to two 
thousand cities within his radius of 
activity — and if he skips a day or 
two we don’t know where he’ll 
strike. I’ve tried to get the mecks 
to report him but I don’t have the 
authority. Two hundred murders is 
pretty insignificant when balanced 
against our other problems. That 
aborigine has just become a hobby 
of mine, I guess.” 

Watcher smiled. “I’ll share 
your hobby for one night and set a 
meek alert. Nap, now. Pe ready at 
dusk.” 

Val took his gear to shaft base 
and waited all night. Nothing. At 
dawn he was about to go to bed 
when the sighting coordinates 
came in. He shot through the 
tubes and hurried upspiral. 

“Did 1 miss him?” he asked the 
Security captain in the shaft cap. 
A squad of police milled around, 
awaiting orders. 

The captain shook his head. 
“No. The crazy fool has been out 
there all morning shaking his tam- 
bourine.” 

Val caught his breath and 
looked at the viewscreen. T4ie ga- 
rage doors were tightly secured so 
he had to rely on the shaftcap’s 
optics. They weren’t too clear. He 
pounded the screen with the heel 
of his palm. What he saw made 
him a bit uneasy. The buckeye 
stood off about a quarter of a 
mile, holding his guitar over his 
left arm like a shield. He seemed 



SONG OF KAIA 



71 




to be standing at parade-rest. But 
the guitar was making the sound 
of a tambourine. 

“How long has he been like 
that?” asked Val. 

“About four hours.” 

Val glanced around for the in- 
sulated gear. Just the usual city 
weapons — quarterstaffs and nets. 

“My men are city police — can’t 
go Outside,” said the captain. 
“That’s a job for a hunter like 
yourself.” 

Val guessed as much. Without 
drugs and hypnosis few Nebishes 
would go Outside, even with the 
suit. 

Val shrugged and put his case of 
arrows into the hopper of one of 
the Harvester robots and started 
pulling on his oversuit. 

‘’I can’t allow you to shoot 
while riding. That would be 
against the prime directive,” re- 
minded the Harvester. “But I’ll be 
happy to take you anywhere you 
want to go.” 

Fine, thought Val. The door 
opened a fraction. 

“Not just yet,” he said, watch- 
ing the screen. The tambourine ca- 
dence had picked up and the buck- 
eye was marching stiffly down a 
clear, wide meek trail directly to- 
wards the garage. All eyes turned 
toward Val. 

He demanded of the viewscreen, 
“I want an analysis of what’s real- 
ly out there. That buckeye has 
never done anything as crazy as 
this before.” 



“The audio and visual are cor- 
rect,” said the screen. 

“But I see a guitar and 1 hear 
tambourines.” 

“Not tambourines — armor,” 

corrected the screen. “As near as 
I can match it up, that sound is the 
sound a Roman legion would 
make as it marched into battle 
many thousands of years ago. On 
that basis the sounds would com- 
pute at three thousand foot sol- 
diers at a distance of one-point- 
eight miles in very hilly terrain.” 

Val glanced out to check on the 
screen’s view. No hills. One buck- 
eye. And no legion. But the more 
he thought about it — it sounded 
like armor. 

The sound rose to 120 decibels, 
hurting the cars of the Security 
people. They backed onto the spi- 
ral. Now the tramping feet and 
clanging spears and shields were 
obvious. The walls trembled. Val 
covered his ears, then, on an im- 
pulse he nocked his arrow and 
stepped to the door. The buckeye 
was less than thirty yards away — 
expressionless — marching straight 
toward the door. Val aimed at his 
chest just above the edge of the 
shielding guitar and shot. Val 
dropped the bow to cover his ears 
but the sound stopped. 

The buckeye lay stretched out 
stiffly on his back, staring at the 
sky with the same blank expres- 
sion he had before the shot. The 
arrowhead, embedded firmly in the 
sternum, had penetrated less than 



72 



IF 




an inch. There was no blood. Val 
walked up and touched the body. 
It was stone cold. The guitar scut- 
tled off like a crab. 

Val took out his trophy knife, 
paused and returned it to it's 
sheath. He stood staring at the last 
buckeye for a long time. The 
Sampler came and waved his 
probe over the body. 

""Been dead since dawn, I'd 
say," grumbled the Sampler. 
""Why did you wait till now to call 
me?" 

Val stood numb. What he had 
just taken part in wasn't an assault 
on a city. It was the death rites for 
the last 5-toed man — rites planned 
by some intelligence who had wait- 
ed for Val to arrive to play his 
part in the ceremonial death of an 
already-dead buckeye warrior. 

Val tried to pull the arrowhead 
out of the sternum but it held fast. 
Classical 5-toed skeleton. If the 
Big ES had had the space to spare 
Val would have liked to have seen 
the body placed in a museum. As 
it was, the sweeper would pick it 
up like any other and in a few 
hours it would be just so much 
woven protein. 

T he evening meld at Walter's 
was dragging on into morning. 
The flavor of the night was a syn- 
thebacon produced by skip-frying 
adrenal glands. Val had enjoyed 
the flavors and entertainment so 
much he consented to stay for the 
meld. Venus soaked some of his 



burn scars in the refresher so he 
wouldn't feel so granular. During 
the meld he thanked her for soften- 
ing up his body. 

""You are a lumpy one, your- 
self," he said as she wriggled past. 
""What's in those breasts?" 

""I'm augmented," she answered 
with a grin. ""My body may be 
bumpy, but my soul is beautiful." 

""I'll agree to that. You certain- 
ly relate well." 

The meld writhed on. When 
Walter came around Val said, 
""Nice meld. You know — we've 
been using the mud on the jumpers 
and have been getting some pretty 
good results." 

Walter smiled. ""Of course — 
Dabbers fight I. A." 

""But there's no sorcery in- 
volved," explained Val. ""The Im- 
munopsych people tell me the soil 
organisms digest the ectodermal 
debris. You live in a cloud of dust, 
but it is dirt dust — not ectodermal 
skin and hair; so you don't get 
sensitized. That's why bamboo 
huts were so safe. There were no 
permanent rugs or drapes to hold 
onto housedust." 

Walter smiled. ""I knew it 
worked." 

W ATCHER called Val in with 
the news that another flower 
cluster had occurred. 

""Another buckeye?" 

""No. It's that renegade guitar 
that was with the last buckeye. It's

still traveling around luring citi- 
zens to their death Outside.” 
“Music?” 

“The same as before. The boys 
from Audiopsych have nailed it 
down to the Pied Piper reaction. 
T.A.R. Thoracic Autonomic Res- 
onator. Remember all the tight- 
beam talk in Security just before 
the big hunt at 50:00?” 

“Yes. Tinker was caught — ” 
“There was more to it than that. 
Tight-beam contacts were made 
with the central historical com- 
puter, too. Music sections were 
examined for T.A.R. items like 
war drums and fertility rites. All 
with nice strong bases that would 
resonate anyone’s thoracic auto- 
nomies.” 

“Pied Piper. So that’s how it 
works. Why are only a handful 
affected at each city?” 

“Don’t know. Probably related 
to autonomic tone.” 

“Can’t we stop this Guitar?” 
“We’ve tried tight beam,” said 
Watcher, “but it won’t obey the 
self-destruct order. Anyway, the 
problem is sort of academic right 
now. The stupid thing has com- 
mandeered a Huntercraft and is 
off somewhere.” 

Val danced around. “The Gui- 
tar stole a Huntercraft? Haven’t 
they tracked it? You can’t loose a 
whole hunterdraft.” 

“The eyes of the Big ES are 
pretty weak, you know. Who 
looks up except an occasional ag- 
romech? Most of Hunter Con- 



trol’s sensors have been transferred 
into the city for crowd monitoring. 
I’m afraid we’ll just have to wait 
until it announces its location by 
interfering with lives or material.” 

XI 

D ee pen presented herself at 
the Clinic for a routine check. 
The haggard Medi-attendant 
stepped into the examining closet 
with her. 

“Unauthorized pregnancy? 
Well, we’re pretty rushed down 
here. You’ll just have to wait like 
the rest and turn it in after it’s 
born.” He gave her a cursory ex- 
amination. “Seems healthy 
enough. Just stay away from the 
saline. This scar on your forearm 
is a little jagged. Must have been 
in a hurry to get your anti-ovula- 
tion capsule out. Most of you un- 
authorized pregs do a neater job 
of it. Oh, 1 see you were one of the 
victims of a buckeye rape. Yes, 
there will be a crowd of the little 
beasts going down the chutes to- 
gether.” He stepped back critical- 
ly. “In about two more weeks. I’d 
say.” 

On her way home she checked 
a possible birth permit. No 
chance. The buckeye rapes had 
been placed in a separate category 
— no consideration could be given 
her request. A copy of the “cate- 
gory order” was posted. She was 
surprised to see Val’s name among 
the sig-natures. 



74 



IF 




“Why you?” she asked Val at 
his private cubicle a few hours la- 
ter. 

“I’m on the committee because 
of my past rank of Sagittarius. 
The committee feels, and I agree, 
that the buckeye gene is undesir- 
able in the Big ES.” 

“But the infant will have my 
genes too — and will be raised in 
Walter’s family-five. We’re your 
friends, loyal citizens. We’ll raise 
the child properly. You know 
that.” 

He narrowed his eyes. A moth- 
er pleading for her unborn was al- 
ways suspect. Basic animal in- 
stincts endangered the Hive co- 
hesion. 

“The buckeye genes make it im- 
possible, Dee Pen. It will probably 
have high gamma A and be prone 
to inappropriate activity — with the 
five-toed strength any I. A. would 
be a real danger to you and your 
friends. It might develop the mass- 
murder syndrome and take you all 
with itin its suicide.” 

Dee Pen swallowed and snapped 
to attention. “Of course. You are 
absolutely right. I’ll chuck it down 
the chute first thing.” 

Val watched her leave, then 
opened a line to Watcher. “Better 
have Security close off the shaft 
caps of the cities where the buck- 
eye-rape pregnancies are coming 
to term. Don’t want any of them 
mothers going flower on us and 
crushing the crops.” 

Watcher nodded. “Good idea. 



I’ll send the directive to the meek 
Doors. No one leaves without a 
special clearance.” 

Val smiled smugly and returned 
to his cot. He had eliminated the 
last buckeye; now he would stop 
the offspring. Big ES would be 
proud. 

Labor for Dee Pen began in the 
meld. They all felt the first pains. 
Loosening the meld slightly, they 
continued to relate and share souls 
— Walter, Venus, Arthur, Bitter 
and Dee Pen — five bodies shared 
in bringing little Kaia into the 
light. The first thing the little new 
pair of eyes saw was the circle of 
five, round, white faces. Ten hands 
lifted and wrapped him and ten 
arms hugged him. 

“I guess it is time to dispose of 
it,” said Bitter after the heat of 
the meld had subsided. 

Dee Pen felt weak and hypoten- 
sive. Her flaccid uterus continued 
to leak blood. A generous vascu- 
lar network which had nourished 
the placenta continued to pour 
blood into the endometrial cavity, 
only now there was no snycytium 
to hold back the erythrocytes — no 
fetal tissues to return her blood to 
her. The smooth muscle fibers of 
the myometrium which surround- 
ed the vascular network had been 
stretched by the pregnancy and fa- 
tigued by the labor. These fibers 
could only twitch ineffectually 
against the escaping red flood. Her 
primordial fear of exsanguination 
triggered the ancient mammalian 



SONG OF KAIA

reflex that has protected mothers 
up through the evolutionary tree 
— by holding the infant to her 
breast she stimulated the nipple- 
midbrain-uterus reflex arc. As the 
large collecting ducts of the breast 
were emptied synapses jumped and 
the uterine fundus clamped down 
tight. Uterine musculature closed 
the vascular network of the pla- 
cental implantation site. Her 
blood by-passed the endometrium. 
It was no longer needed there. 

Dee Pen held the infant to her 
breast. She glanced suspiciously 
up at the circle of four Nebishes. 
Was it necessary to dispose of the 
baby so soon. Unauthorized in- 
fants could be kept up till age one 
— when they became humans by 
starting to talk. Certainly there 
no rush. Its feeding wouldn’t take 
too many calories. 

Venus disagreed. “Of course we 
should dispose of it now. Can’t 
subdivide our calorie-basic. Don’t 
want the old beri-beri sneaking up 
on us again, do we?’’ 

Dee Pen found no support in 
the circle of faces. 

“Don’t take it now. My uterus 
will loosen and I’ll bleed if I don’t 
nurse it,’’ she said. 

Walter gave her fundus a 
squeeze, saying, “She’s right you 
know. She needs the infant to pre- 
vent hemorrhage. There’s no rush. 
I’ll share my calories for a while.’’ 

Dee Pen smiled up at him in the 
pleasant delirium of post partum 
fatigue. “You know, Walter, in 



my next life I’d like to come back 
as a bird.’’ 

He watched her eyes close in 
sleep. She mumbled^, “A talking 
bird. I’d just sit on your shoulder 
and we’d talk, and talk — and talk.” 

He put a protective hand on the 
frail, little female philosopher and 
watched her thorax rise and fall 
gently. She certainly did like to 
talk. 



V AL continued to put in his full 
shift with the Watcher. Most 
of his time was spent with the 
jumpers but there was an occasion- 
al . mushroom reaction between 
walls and a rare flower on the Out- 
side to add variety. But he couldn’t 
forget what had happened to Tink- 
er and he was concerned that Dee 
Pen might somehow let her 5-toed 
child live. Watcher was not con- 
cerned. 

“Impossible. Doors have their 
orders. Exit is not authorized. Bit- 
ter and Arthur have been advised 
that they can earn extra calories if 
they keep me informed of her ac- 
tivities. Dee Pen isn’t going Out- 
side. No one is.” 

Val strolled absently through his 
old office at Hunter Control. 
More junk had accumulated and 
many of the corridors were im- 
passable. The dust was thick and 
spongy everywhere. In the control 
section he saw disturbances in the 
dust. An auxiliary cable had been 
snaked around. He found Walter 



76 



IF 




wheezing at his old console. Sev- 
eral of the panel lights glowed. 

“Walter. You shouldn’t be up 
here.” 

The old man smiled and pushed 
white hair back from his eyes. 
“Can’t spend the rest of my life 
just sitting around in bed. Besides, 
I was wondering if old Doberman 
ever showed up again.” 

“Doberman? Oh, the hunter- 
craft that was stolen by that crazy 
guitar.” Val glanced at the screen. 
“Anything on the detectors?” 

“Less than ten percent are still 
functioning.” 

Walter fingered a row of but- 
tons. The view jumped around 
from garden to garden. Nothing 
unusual showed. 

They walked through the hunter 
garage, reminiscing. The old craft 
seemed mummified under dull, 
gray shrouds of dust. Doberman’s 
bay had been swept out and tidied. 

“You did this?” asked Val. 

Walter nodded. 

“Isn’t that Doberman’s energy 
cell? How is he traveling without 
power? Are any of the other cells 
missing?” 

Walter shrugged. “Not that I 
know of — but any Guitar that can 
get a dead buckeye to walk into 
your arrow can get a dead Hunter- 
craft moving around.” 

Val scowled and examined the 
cell. It was Doberman’s serial 
number all right. Odd. Why didn’t 
the guitar leave the cell in and just 
recharge it at the power socket on 



the wall. Buckeyes had made sim- 
ilar unauthorized use of power dur- 
ing their migrations when they 
commandeered the agromechs. 

D ee pen was pleased by little 
Kaia’s rapid growth. Unlike 
the average Nebish infant who sits 
at one year and walks at two, the 
little 5-toed hybrid was trying to 
walk at six months. She hid him 
from the neighbors but female Bit- 
ter informed the Watcher of the 
progress. 

“That’s a big stack of diapers,” 
said Bitter. 

Dee Pen took the diapers from 
the dispenser and bundled them up. 
“I’ve shared your quarters and 
calorie basic long enough,” she 
said. She picked up Kaia and start- 
ed into the crawl way. 

“Where are you going?” 
“Outside.” 

“But you’ll just die. You heard 
what Val said about the wilted 
flower people. The sun’s too hot.” 
“If I stay in the Hive I’ll have to 
surrender little Kai. I can’t do it. 
We’ll go Outside. He doesn’t have 
anything to lose.” 

“But you do,” said Bitter. 
“Why throw away your life for a 
little hybrid?” 

The Security people were quick 
to respond with their nets and 
quarter staffs. They blundered into 
disinterested crowds for a few min- 
utes but finally got the spiral walk- 
way secured at shaft base. She 
wouldn’t escape through the tubes.

She started to climb. 
“Unauthorized,” said the Door. 
She worked her way around the 
shaftcap, trying all the garage ex- 
its. Below on the spiral the squad 
of Security neuters closed in on 
their easy prey. She screamed and 
little Kai cried. 

From across the spiral one of 
the garage Doors called out, “This 
way — ward of Gitar. This way.” 

V AL and Walter stood in the 
garage, examining the dis- 
carded diaper. 

“She couldn’t have- been too 
panicky if she paused to change a 
diaper,” said Val. 

Walter questioned the Door and 
the garage dispenser. 

“Apparently this fellow, Kaia, 
had a class-six meek with him when 
he mated with Dee Pen. These ma- 
chines were obeying old orders of 
the class six, not the Watcher’s di- 
rective.” 

“Mutiny.” 

“No,” said Walter. “Just a 
question of authority. The Door 
and dispenser are just class thir- 
teens — obey anyone in the hier- 
archy above them. A class six is 
pretty far up. Our whole city is run 
by a class six.” 

Val blustered, “Well, they can’t 
have gotten far. What items did the 
dispenser give them?” 

Walter handed him the flimsy. 
He read the list of food, protective 
clothing, diapers and sundries. 
“What is this? Jodhpurs?” 



“Baggy riding breeches.” 

“Riding? What is there to ride?” 
exploded Val. Then he followed 
Walter’s gaze and gasped. “An ag- 
romech!” They squinted out into 
the blazing sun. Without protective 
gear they could not follow her. 
They shut the door and rubbed 
their eyes. “Lets put a call in for 
that agromech. If it doesn’t return 
we can get authorization to acti- 
vate a huntercraft.” 

At the wall panel they raised the 
agromech. 

“Where are you?” demanded 
Val. 

“Working in the fields. I have 
my chores.” said the machine. 

Walter smiled. 

“Did you give anyone transpor- 
tation out of the garage this morn- 
ing?” asked Val. 

“Yes. A mother and child. My 
itinerary is recorded if you’d care 
to review it.” 

Val fingered the controls and a 
map indicated the meek’s move- 
ments. 

“This is simulated, of course — 
but it looks like he dropped them 
off right over here in the plankton 
forest. That’s not far. We could 
walk there in half a day after we 
get our gear on,” offered Walter. 

They put their order in at the 
dispenser. Val was a bit shocked 
when Walter objected to arrows. 

“They are Outside and this is a 
Hunt,” Val reminded him. 

Walter coughed and flushed with 
anger. “That’s Dee Pen you are 
talking about.” 



78 



IF 




“You’ve been on hunts before. 
This is no different. They have bro- 
ken from the Big ES and now they 
crush crops. If you can talk Dee 
Pen into coming back for psycho- 
therapy, fine. But the five-toed kid 
has to go.” Val made a wicked 
gesture with his trophy knife. 

Walter lowered his head: “Okay, 
I’ll go along.” 

They found nothing among the 
plankton towers. In the weeks that 
followed Val doggedly reviewed 
optic records from the agromechs, 
catching occasional glimpses of the 
fugitives and then following up 
with a hunt on foot. 

S HE huddled in her nest, avoid- 
ing the harsh actinics while she 
watched her son play. He had 
browned and calloused quickly. 
Already his tangle of black hair 
and bright eyes resembled his fa- 
ther’s — and the quick way he took 
to swimming reassured her. He 
crawled and ran continually during 
the day — grubbing with his fingers 
for tubers or climbing leafy things 
for fruits. 

Her hair bleached and her skin 
peeled. Each day brought more 
traumas to her Nebish body. But 
she smiled when she saw her son 
growing strong. And she taught 
him what she could about surviv- 
ing Outside. 

When Walter found her, curled- 
up and cold in the nest by the ca- 
nal, he kneeled beside her body and 
cried. Val sneered and examined 



the loose leaves scattered over her 
face. 

“Looks like the kid tried to cov- 
er her up,” he said glancing 
around. A herd of cetaceans 
splashed in the canal. One of the 
little heads bobbing up and down 
was shaggier than the rest. Val’s 
Nebish eyes failed to see the or- 
phan. The herd passed. One pair of 
eyes seemed fixed on his coveralls 
with the glint of hate mixed with 
childish fear. Val saw but didn’t 
see. The idea of a swimming infant 
was completely alien to his four- 
toed vision. He saw a harsh sun 
overhead, a dense tangle of under- 
growth and the wide deep canal — 
all death traps for the Nebish. 

Walter stood up and sniffed. 
“You know, it is like she was a 
flower. She blossomed for a time 
and then died, giving birth to her 
seed. All that’s left here is a drying 
husk.” 

“Well, she gave her life for noth- 
ing. How do you expect a one- 
year-old to survive Outside if the 
mother can’t?” 

Walter said simply, “He has the 
five-toed gene.” 

“And Olga to protect him, too, 
I suppose.” 

“As a matter of fact, yes,” came 
a metallic voice over his communi- 
cator. ^ 

Val jerked around in his heavy 
insulated suit to see Doberman ap- 
proaching above the trees. Panic 
grabbed his throat. Reflexively, he 
nocked an arrow. The craft landed

and quieted its engine. Gitar 
floated out on his sandwich-field. 

“Were you planning on shooting 
me?” asked Gitar. 

Val lowered the bow. 

Gitar hovered over Dee Pen’s 
body. His voice still came over the 
communicator. “I’m sorry I wasn’t 
here when she came Outside — but 
there is so much to do on the plan- 
et. I hope the child is all right.” 

“Why are you concerned for the 
child?” asked Walter. 

“He’s the next generation. He 
has the good genes.” 

“Bad genes, you mean,” shouted 
Val. 

“You don’t have to raise your 
voice,” said Gitar. “I can hear 
you. By good genes I meant good 
for man. You are still thinking as 
an agent for the Hive. Of course 
the five-toed gene is bad for the 
Hive but that is another life form. 
I came from Olga and I’m inter- 
ested in man.” 

“Why?” asked Walter. 

“The five-toed men are Her peo- 
ple. Their genes are the true, noble 
genes. When Olga walks the stars 
she takes them with her. The Hive 
has no place for Olga — it would 
try to destroy her — or, worse, ig- 
nore her.” 

“When Olga comes again — ” 
began Walter excitedly, then col- 
lapsed. Val cracked his helmet to 
see the cyanotic domino mask had 
returned. He tried to lift him, but 
he was too weak and clumsy in the 
bulky suit. 



Gitar called “Rhea!” 

A large coweye stepped hesitant- 
ly from the Huntercraft and 
glanced around. Val recoiled. She 
gently picked up Walter and placed 
him inside the craft. 

“Medikit,” suggested Gitar. 

Val collected his wits and 
climbed in. He opened the kit and 
took out a mild stimulant. He 
nudged the pinkness back into 
Walter’s face. He glanced around 
the craft. It was full of neolithic 
tools, utensils and wicker baskets. 
A bundle of hides and poles in one 
corner resembled a buckeye shel- 
ter. 

Gitar took his place in the emp- 
ty socket that had housed Dober- 
man’s power cell. The hatch closed 
and the internal environment 
cooled to a comfortable Hive tem- 
perature. Val cracked his helmet. 
The powerful coweye sat cross- 
legged on the floor and eyed him 
sullenly. 

Gitar said, “This is Rhea. A 
coweye. Have you ever talked to 
one before?” 

Val stiffened. “You’re not going 
to influence me by — ” 

Gitar played soothing music and 
said, “Relax. This is just a truce 
until you can get Walter back on 
his feet again. No fraternizing. 
Rhea, fix Walter a bowl of tea.” 

Val made a motion to protect 
Walter from the brew but Walter 
held up his hand. 

“It’s okay, Val. I’ll drink it, 
whatever it is. If Gitar can make a 



SONG OF KAIA

dead buckeye walk maybe he can 
help me get back on my feet, too.” 
They watched Walter drink. He 
seemed mildly refreshed. 

'"I actually didn't make a dead 
man walk,” explained Gitar. 
was just holding him up with my 
traction Held.” 

He moved a pile of hides to 
demonstrate. 

“Was it a rite of some sort?” 
“Not really,” said Gitar. “One 
buckeye had died, and I was just 
using him to lure out a replace- 
ment.” 

“A hunter you mean.” 

“Same thing. I figured that with 
the huntercraft deactivated the on- 
ly hunters I would get would be the 
cream. Someone with a little of the 
five-toed gene.” 

Val scoffed. “You got me.” 

Gitar played a tune that moved 
in the 200 hertz range. He sang a 
melancholy ballade of buckeyes 
and hunters meeting in the gardens. 
The strong survived. 

Val was irritated by the words. 
“It all sounds fine and noble but 
many of those fine hunters ended 
up getting eaten. Why would the 
Big ES send its finest men to pro- 
vide meals for savages?” 

“The five-toed gene was a prob- 
lem for the Hive but their superior 
individuals w^e more likely to 
carry it. The strong eating the 
strong is necessary in any ecologi- 
cal system when all the good pro- 
tein is concentrated in the cream of 
the population.” 



Val stood up. “I want no part in 
this line of reasoning. If you can’t 
mate them, eat them — that’s ab- 
surd.” 

Walter tugged Val’s sleeve. 
“Wait. This makes sense to me.” 

Val pulled his arm away. “Next 
you’re going to want me to mate 
with this — ” He pointed to the 
coweye. 

“You already have,” said Gitar. 

“What?” 

The coweye turned her back and 
picked up her long flowing mane. 
A slightly puckered white asterisk 
marked her left scapular area — the 
scar of his arrow. Then she went to 
one of the wicker baskets and lifted 
out a sleeping junglebunny about 
one year old. 

Val stood open-mouthed. Years 
of Hive conditioning fell away. The 
child had his thin face and delicate 
features, but it also had its moth- 
er’s broad palms and 5-toed feet. 

“She’s a girl. We call her little 
Rhea,” said the coweye. 

Val sat down next to Walter. 

“Bred true.” Walter smiled. “I 
always wondered about your curi- 
osity and enthusiasm. It was the 
gene.” 

“I carry the gene?” 

“I guess your kid proves you do. 
Oh, I’ve always suspected. The 
ridge breadth on your palms was 
suspiciously wide and your gamma 
is over eighty mg.” 

“When did you check that?” 

“The lab work you had after the 
coweye ran over you on the dark 



82 



IF 




continent — excuse me, after Rhea 
ran over you.” 

Val smiled for the first time. 
“And I guess she really ran over 
me. 

Walter added: “Never hunt a 
coweye in the follicular phase.” 

They both laughed. 

Val sobered. “I have the gene,” 
he said. “I have the gene and I’ve 
been hunting them all my life.” 

“The five-toed gene is often its 
own worst enemy,” said Gitar phil- 
osophically. “How much attention 
has the Big ES been paying to 
buckeyes during the last two 
years?” 

Val looked at Walter and 
shrugged. “None, actually. After 
the hunt at 50:00 the huntercraft 
were shut down. There were no 
sightings. Walter and I were doing 
a little hunting on our own time, 
and with our own credits.” 

Gitar’s skin rippled with cheer- 
ful squares and triangles. “I 
thought as much. The buckeye 
population three years ago was 
nearly three million for the planet. 
Now it is less than a hundred.” 

“How will they ever survive?” 
asked Walter. 

Gitar smiled. “That’s why Olga 
sent me — to find the mature five- 
toeds and mate them. Do you 
know that Rhea is the only coweye 
on this continent? There are dozens 
of scattered junglebunnies — thanks 
to my efforts last season. But it 
will be quite a strain on my g-bot- 
tle to keep track of them. Fortu- 



nately the agromechs identify with 
them and help, as long as they 
aren’t asked to disobey a direct or- 
der of the Hive. Of course it will 
be easier without the hunters, and 
with our population of five-toeds 
so low it should be a long time be- 
fore the Big ES notices us again.” 
Val frowned. “But the Hive 
knows you are here now. The 
rapes. The clusters of flowers.” 
“You noticed that, not the 
Hive.” 

“The Pied Piper activity,” said 
Walter, concerned. “Why lure 
those citizens to a flower death?” 
Gitar’s rolling base locked onto 
Val’s 5-toed autonomies and he 
believed even before Gitar said, “I 
pipe them buckeye with a song. 
Only those with a high toned neu- 
rohumoral axis respond — one in a 
hundred thousand. But thus far 
none have lived long enough i6 
mate. I’ll keep trying— that’s my 
mission. G.I.T.A.R. stands for 
Guitar Identity Thoracic Auto- 
nomic Resonator. I use the T.A.R. 
effect to try to add five-toed genes 
to Olga’s gene pool. However, the 
Hive has weeded out most of them 
with I.A. and M.R. If I can get 
one in a billion I’ll feel lucky.” 

Val’s medulla believed and it 
was convincing his cortex. Gitar 
continued: “My drum brother 
D. I. T.A.R. and I have always 
played important roles in the 
games of man — mating and battle 
— love and war — passions of the 
five-toed gene.” 



SONG OF KAIA 



83 




Val was still adjusting. Terms 
like “love” and “war” were foreign 
to hive creatures — and to hear even 
a machine mention them enthusi- 
astically bothered him a little. 

“War.” Val shuddered. 

“It’s preferable to — how do you 
say it — chucking your own infants 
down the chute.” reminded Gitar. 

Val looked at his kid sleeping in 
the basket — and wondered what 
kind of a hell mother’s lived in af- 
ter they had killed their own. He 
realized, then, the nobility of the 
five-toed gene. For the 5-toed com- 
pete, fight and even kill — but they 
kill strangers for food and land. 
They lay their lives on the line for 
their offspring. The strong survive 
and the genetic line gets stronger. 
In the Hive the killing that takes 
place is the obedient mother killing 
her own child. 

The infant stirred. Val reached 
in and patted it back to sleep. At 
sunset they left the craft and set up 
Rhea’s shelter on the bank of the 
canal. Walter buried Dee Pen in 
her nest and rimmed it with mussel 
shells. Gitar explained how impor- 
tant diet would be during the new- 
comers’ first months Outside. Lots 
of nicotinic-acid-rich liver from a 
cetacean would be necessary to 
protect them from pellagrin actinic 
dermatitis. Their prior Nebish diet 
had left them vitamin-depleted. 

A fter they were settled Gitar 
sang. Rhea fed the infant and 
then the two of them went for a 



swim. Val and Walter watched 
from the bank. 

“Do you think you’ll be able to 
swim, some day?” asked Walter. 

Val caught a mussel Rhea threw 
and laughed. “I’ll not only swim. 
I’ll run and climb, too — and so will 
you.” > 

Gitar’s words drifted over the 
moonlit waters: 

I was born on a wandering star. 

You've heard my name, Pm 
called Gitar. 

I've come to Earth, mankind to 
find. 

I'll search canal and spiral wind.

strong. 

When I return to my home sun. 

I'll take Olga's men, every one. 

Children of Olga, You'll be 
free. 

To walk the stars, eternally . 

Gitar gave them a taste of the 
T.A.R. effect by slipping into an 
erotic mating ballade. Rhea’s il- 
iopsoas muscle became entrained 
by the rhythm, and her pelvis 
rocked violently as she danced. It

was the first of many nights, wild 
and free. 

G ITAR moved on, his Q-bottle 
powering the Huntercraft. 
Walter’s life span came to an end. 
He was put in the ground next to 
Dee Pen and surrounded by shells. 
His last days had been idyllic. He 
swam and he played with Val’s 
children. He lived out his dream, 
for he had talked to Gitar, disciple 
of Olga, and he learned of a land 
where men lived without the shad- 
ow of the Hive. A land men shared 
with species other than himself. A 
land where there were fish, animals 
and birds. Flowers appeared on 
their gravesites occasionally; blos- 
soms picked by a buckeye — lonely 
and strong — little Kaia. 



Below in the Hive the Big ES 
stagnated. The Nebish became an 
obese little dwarf; with chalky, 
soft bones and rosewater for blood. 
He was hypogonadal, dim-minded 
and blind — only rarely did he con- 
tribute a buckeye to the gene pool. 

Val lived to see three genera- 
tions of his 5-toed descendants 
spread over the land. Gitar added 
legends to their culture with song. 
They were the Tribe of Prince Val- 
iant, vigorous, strong. 

As their numbers increased 
the hunters returned. 

Big ES did what it must to 
survive. 

Gitar said it was time 
for Olga's return 

when Buckeyes start crowding

KING UNDER THE MOUNTAIN 



He was a top 
brain above ground. 
But deep in 
the earth — what? 

GENE WOLFE 



F ive thousand feet down in the 
lithosphere of Earth it labored, 
unmoving. The millions upon mil- 
lions of cables linking it to the sev- 
en continents were sealed in the 
stone and never seen; the single 
elevator was almost a myth. 

A man stood in that elevator, 
dropping. Watching through the 





glass the stone rushing up. Listen- 
ing to the hiss of the cables play- 
ing out above him. Breathing. Pac- 
ing the diagonal of the elevator 
car, three steps. And three steps 
back. Exulting. Down. 

He had always expected to be 
here. He had learned of this place 
as a boy in school, learned sur- 
rounded by louts twice his age and 
he, knowing his superiority, had 
thought, / w/7/ be there. That is the 
real capital, the core of the core. 
A number there, a tiny change in a 
number there and you could feel 
the whole world working like 
dough. 

The elevator slowed, slowed, 
stopped. The door opened and he 
stepped out. The room was big, 
very big, clean and silent as a mau- 
soleum; the computer itself made 
one wall: a bank of tiny, blinking 
lights as high as the ten-meter ceil- 
ing, as wide as the thirty-meter 
room. Its peripheral equipment, 
printers and plotters, television- 
like visual displays, made dull- 
gleaming islands where they rose 
from the smooth floor. 

“Hello,” the man from the ele- 
vator said to the computer. “Can 
you hear me?” 

A voice beside him said, “No, it 
can t. 

The voice belonged to a small 
man in a clean, white smock. “We 
don’t have vocal I/O,” the small 
man continued. (He pronounced it 
eye-oh.) “They’re hardly efficient, 
really.” 



The man from the elevator in- 
troduced himself and said, “I got a 
good deal of use from the one on 
our central facility at Harvard. I 
was looking into the transflnite 
differentials of some of Lobachev- 
sky’s equations and I found on line 
real time interaction with the ma- 
chine to be one of the most useful 
techniques.” He wondered if the 
little man had any concept of how 
important you had to be to get on 
line with the main computer at 
Harvard. 

Probably not. 

“We don’t have vocal I/O 
here,” the small man repeated 
stubbornly. 

“Perhaps you should show me 
what you do have. After all. I’m 
supposed to help you and I can’t 
do that unless I know what you’ve 
got.” 

“Are you supposed to help us?” 
the small man said. 

“I’ll explain, although I’ve been 
given to understand that you have 
already been briefed. After the No- 
bel Awards — I’m putting this as 
concisely as possible — the secre- 
tary general called me in and I 
suggested to him that this might 
make a nice more or less unofficial 
prize for me and that I might be 
able to do you people some good. 
He was quite taken with the idea.” 

“That’s what I thought,” the 
small man said. “You’re more or 
less a tourist. Are you familiar 
with computers?” 

“I can program assembler lan- 



KING UNDERTHE MOUNTAIN 



87 




guage for several. But I wouldn't 
call myself a specialist." 

“Assemblers aren’t what they 
used to be — they make them pret- 
ty easy now. But this is an old- 
fashioned machine. Built over fifty 
years ago." 

“Designed over fifty years ago," 
the man from the elevator correct- 
ed him, “but not fully complete 
until last year as 1 understand it, 
although it’s been in service more 
than thirty years. The cost has 
been — ’’ 

“Yes,’’ the small man said, 
“like a cathedral. Now, those 
lights over there— you may not be 
familiar with those and they’re not 
just for show. Each one represents 
a working subsection of the ma- 
chine and is turned on when that 
subsection is engaged. Most of 
them look dim because the areas 
they represent are engaging and 
disengaging all the time. The idea 
is to show what parts are involved 
when there’s trouble." 

“I understand." 



T ' HE small man stood with his 
hands clasped behind his back, 
staring at the myriad winking 
lights. Half to himself he said, 
“It’s just like looking at a city at 
night. Each one is a window, a fac- 
tory or an office or an apartment, 
and if it’s on you know they’re 
awake and working ther^.’’ 

“I suppose that’s true — but I 
doubt there is much value in ro- 



manticizing it like that. If you 
don’t have vocal, how do you com- 
municate with it?" 

“It’s all the cities in the world," 
the small man said, still half to 
himself. “New York, London, 
Tokyo, everything." Then in his 
normal voice: “Come along. There 
are various methods. I’ll show 
you." 

He led the man from the eleva- 
tor to a massive keyboard. “For 
short stuff you can just use this. 
You understand that the machine 
doesn’t really stop everything else 
it’s doing to pay attention to you. 
The monitor program deternfiines 
the priority of your material and 
cues it behind all the more impor- 
tant material. When it has time it 
will set aside a portion of core — 
that’s what we call the machine’s 
mind — to deal with you. It’s work- 
ing on other things all the time. 
The price of grain everywhere in 
the world, for instance. Whether or 
not the atmosphere can stand an- 
other power station on the Taymyr 
Peninsula. Everything." 

“I’m sure I should be assigned a 
very low priority." 

“You will be. You want to 
make the entry yourself?" 

“Yes." 

“Then you’ll need to know the 
right formats. Here." The small 
man slid a yellowing, stapled man- 
ual from a niche in the console. 
“If you need help call me." 

After an hour and a half the 
man from the elevator moved a

IF 




switch on the console and wrote 
slowly: / / JOB . X*Q . EN 
LAN CO...X*Q-Q and his 
question: WILL 1 — better be sure, 
he thought, and added his social 
security number — 987-6678-5803- 
443 BECOME CHIEF SYS- 
TEMS ANALYST AT THIS IN- 
STALLATION PRIOR TO THE 
ELECTION OF A NEW SEC- 
RETARY GENERAL. The word 
JOB in the control statements pre- 
ceded by the double slash would 
alert the machine to a new task, 
wiping out any garbage instruc- 
tions a previous user might have 
left on the console. After executing 
the English Language Code — 
bringing the most sophisticated 
coding language yet devised, near- 
ly identical to standard English, 
from a storage location to core — 
it would be ready to “execute” 
(answer) his question. He touched 
the PROGRAM START button. 
On the keyboard a red light labled 
INPUT ERROR flashed instantly. 

“Those aren’t the right control 
statements,” the small man said 
behind him. “Here.” He pushed 
the man from the elevator aside 
and his fingers flew across the key- 
board. “That’ll retrieve your ques- 
tion, whatever it was.” 

“1 assure you — ” the man from 
the elevator began, picking up the 
manual. 

“It’s a little out of date. Any- 
way, they just write them to sell 
the machines, you know, I’ll show 
you what to do sometime.” 



“When will it have an answer 
to—” 

“In the basket beside you.” 

The man from the elevator took 
the slip of paper from the basket. 
It read: 4E E -9 (HEX). “I don’t 
understand this,” he said. “Is it a 
probability?” 

“If that’s what you asked for. 
It’s in hexidecimal notation.” 

“I don’t—” 

“The base is sixteen instead of 
ten. We use the Arabic numerals 
for one through nine and the letters 
A through F for the ten through 
fifteen. That makes your ‘4E’ 
mean seventy-eight — in other 
words, fourteen (that’s the ‘E’) 
plus four times the base. The sec- 
ond ‘E’ indicates that the number 
following is an exponent or more 
properly a characteristic, so the 
answer is point seven zeros four E, 
or seventy-eight over sixteen to the 
ninth power. For most purposes 
that’s zero.” 

“That’s not possible. My ques- 
tion was just a test, an obvious de- 
velopment in my own career.” 

“My opinion of your question 
would have no value. You may 
want to check your phrasing.” 

“The phrasing is perfectly cor- 
rect. Don’t you have some method 
that would put me in closer con- 
tact with the machine? I — ” the 
man from the elevator paused and 
a brief, icy smile crossed his face 
— “I’d like to argue with it a lit- 
tle.” 

“We have this,” the small man 



IF 



89 




said. He touched the console with 
his fingertips and it began to re- 
volve slowly and noiselessly. The 
keyboard rotated away; a seat, a 
display panel with a hundred or 
more signal lights and a chromi- 
um helmet, took its place. “Direct 
mental communication. This is 
what I mostly use myself.” 

Despite his self-possession the 
man from the elevator was awed. 
“I didn’t know there was such a 
thing,” he said. 

“The machine itself worked it 
out for us. We haven’t made it 
public yet and most people 
couldn’t use it anyway.” 

“May I try it?” 

“You understand that whatever 
instruction you give must be 
thought thfough logically. No 
mental confusion.” 

“Of course.” 

“You’re likely to have a good 
deal of trouble with it at first. 
Those lights on the display panel 
are to help you diagnose what 
you’re doing wrong. The booklet 
beside them tells what each one 
means.” 

“I understand,” the man from 
the elevator said. He picked up the 
helmet and put it on. The lights on 
the display panel flashed red. All 
of them. 

The small man made a tiny 
noise and said, “You’d better read 
the manual first.” 

W HEN the man from the ele- 
vator had gone back up the 



elevator the small man rotated the 
console again and put a question 
to the great machine, including an 
extended answer instruction with 
his control statements. After a 
moment’s thought he added a 
question about the helmet to his 
program. The damn thing hadn’t 
worked right since they’d built it 
and just before the man from the 
elevator had interrupted him he 
had fed the computer his trouble- 
shooting schedule. 

The papers he received in reply

mately. And the chances that the 
helmet would be working before he 
had to try for another appropria- 
tion were one hundred percent: uni- 
ty. The small man smiled, closed 
one eye, and raised the fingers of 
his right hand, curled to form an 
imaginary telescope, to the other. 
Looking at one of the flashing pia- 
points on the immense wall he 
imagined it was indeed an apart- 
ment window, with a girl undress- 
ing inside. Then he laughed. •

When he returned from the 
stars. Earth would be older — 
but not the woman he loved!

H e signaled return twelve 
light-years out, on attaining 
peak velocity. Earth station com- 
puters— when they finally got his 
message — would punch out his ar- 
rival time to within forty-eight 
hours of accuracy. They integrated 
it from the signal shape and by a 
kind of parallax. The warping of 
the continuum about a craft travel- 
ing near the speed of light gave it 
a double image. 

It took the computers a week to 
check and doublecheck. Then the 
tape went into the traffic banks to 
start rescheduling local flights up 
to six months ahead, to leave the 
field — and space — clear for his ar- 
rival. His ship would “re-appear” 
well outside the ecliptic; all the 
same, a DCP — direct continuum 
propulsion — ship demanded a lot 
of room. And got it. 

He came in out of permanent 
night into the transitory night of 
his home planet. But Sheppard 
Field was brighter than day. The 
lights dimmed as he grounded. 
They always did. It had become a 
kind of salute. In fact, it was more 
of a publicity gesture by the com- 
pany, to allow full sight of the 
strange fires that played around a 
deep-space ship at landing. 

They were fading as, ground pro- 
cedures completed, he opened up 
and descended, and the battery of 
lights leaped up to full strength 
again. Faces were a white blur be- 



yond the perimeter fence. The faint, 
faraway noise could have been 
cheering. Probably was. 

Reporters clustered. Uniformed 
field guards kept them back to al- 
low passage to a crewcut figure 
who approached with the pumping 
stride of a little man determined to 
show that he could walk as fast as 
a big man. And, by implication, do 
anything else. He thrust out a 
hand. Cameras clicked and rolled. 

“Grant?” 

Grant smiled inwardly ''at the 
query in the voice. But they were 
strangers, after all, he and this 
man in a mauve suit. 

“I’m Bassick. Chief of Flight 
Programing. Have a good trip?” 

“Good?” Grant allowed himself 
a smile now. “That depends on 
what your analysts make of the 
data I brought back. Quantity’s 
there, at least. There wasn’t much 
room left in the banks by the time 
I’d finished.” 

Bassick nodded happily. 

“There are also some physical 

specimens you may find interest- 
ing ” 

mg. 

“Artifacts” The corners of 
Bassick’s mouth went down a 
fraction as Grant shook his head. 

“Mineral stuff, mostly. Little 
life at all. Surprisingly little. A 
pleasant enough planet as they go. 
Everything seemed right for a 
pretty rich ecology — and it wasn’t 
there. But I clocked in full data 
on that point.” 

“Well, even negatives can be

IF 




useful to somebody.” The little 
man turned to the reporters. 
“Okay, boys, you’ve seen him. 
And you’ve had the company 
handout. Give the guy a break, 
eh? He’s been traveling fourteen 
years getting here.” A laugh went 
up. The joke wasn’t as familiar to 
them, a new generation, as it was 
to Grant. “Press conference to- 
morrow as arranged, at fifteen 
hundred hours.” 

They dispersed good-humored- 
ly enough, photographers taking 
a few more pictures as Bassick 
ushered Grant to the Personnel 
Block. 

“A car was laid on,” said Bas- 
sick. “But I thought you’d like to 
get your planet-legs.” 

He used a spaceman’s words 
with the self-conscious unctuous- 
ness of the earthbound. Grant de- 
cided that he didn’t like Bassick 
overmuch — nor care one whit for 
that fact. 

“What happened to Goodman?” 

The other looked up at him with 
no more than a company man’s 
mask of regret. “He passed on 
eleven years ago. Heart. They 
Pushed lym to Replacement, of 
course, but the new one didn’t 
take. I was at his side. I don’t 
think he wanted it to, somehow.” 

That vas more than likely. 
Grant thought. Goodman had al- 
ways prided himself on his physical 
fitness. An independent man in a 
world increasingly dependent on 
artificial aids. Betrayed by one 



body, he wouldn’t have wanted 
to start relying on another. 

“I thought his son was in line to 
take over from him. Young . 
Paul, wasn’t it?” 

“He was. I had more executive 
points. He left the company. He’s 
with some inner-planet outfit now, 
I believe.” 

“And my — buddies?” Grant 
spoke the word ironically. One he 
had never met; the other he had 
not seen since training days, two 
hundred years — Earth time— ago. 

“Kroll’s doing fine. Hazlitt was 
grounded after his last trip. His re- 
placement’s a youngster called Eb- 
sen. Pity about Hazlitt. Only had 
one trip to go. But he’s making 
out. Took a farm in Brazil.” They 
walked along a way. “Do you 
have any plans?” 

“What — in case I flunk my 
medical?” 

“It’s your last time around, too. 
But I didn’t mean that. You look 
in good shape. I meant, after your 
last mission?” 

“Time enough to think about 
that. But I don’t see myself farm- 
ing in Brazil or anywhere else.” 
Grant’s face freaked in a sardonic 
smile. “Might buy a small space 
line and do a spot of hiring and 
firing myself.” 

But despite his joking he felt a 
twinge of unworthy fear as they 
entered Personnel. A truncated 
service term made a huge differ- 
ence to a man’s finances. That was 
something you couldn’t insure 



THE LAST TIME AROUND

against. With the vast investment 
the company put into a DCP ship 
and its pilot — and the time span 
between that and arty yield — the 
payment structure was logical 
enough, with its penalty clauses 
for failure to stay the course. 

It made this life, inevitably, a 
gamble. Not, ironically, out there 
— instrumentation took a lot of 
the risk out of that — but here, in 
what a man came back to. When 
he had started out, there had been 
wry jokes about whether there 
would be anything to come back 
to. Star flight had come at the 
crux of man’s technological ability 
to destroy himself and his planet. 
But things had settled down over 
the past two centuries. At every 
return the world seemed crazier 
on the surface but saner under- 
neath, where it mattered. 

He felt annoyed to be thinking 
about the money angle. It hadn’t 
been the money that had attracted 
him. It took more complicated 
reasons to lead a man into a ca- 
reer like this. He’d given up the 
central years of his life to an exis- 
tence without continuity, isolated 
from everybody else — by time 
more than by space. The wish for 
that was something the company 
psychiatrists delved very deep to 
find in a man. When they did, he 
was out before he started. They 
looked for an idealist of sorts, a 
special kind of loner. A special 
kind — but there were enough 
around. The need for perfect phys- 



ical fitness winnowed the ranks 
down. A doctorate in science 
gained early enough to enable an 
applicant to complete a stringent 
and specialized training program 
by the time he was twenty-five was 
another qualification that reduced 
the number to hardly more than 
the company required. Which was 
two when he had started. 

Even now there were only three 
ships. It was an expensive business 
for a company to be in. And it 
could be an expensive business for 
a man coming out into a world of 
normal time and an unknowable 
future. 

A few inner-planet men, in their 
midnight blue, were spread around 
the reception lounge. They looked 
up from their drinks at sight of 
Grant’s sage-green uniform; some 
waved in wary greeting. In their 
glances was the usual mixture — it 
didn’t change with the generations 
— of ... it was difficult to analyze 
. something of envy, something 
of You re welcome. Jack, some- 
thing of resentment — and a large 
amount of workaday relief, that 
they could now get back into their 
own backyard of space. 

Grant waved briefly in return — 
theirs was a camaraderie he could 
never be part of — and trod the fam- 
iliar way to the Medical Section. 
They were lined up and waiting for 
him. 

H e came out two hours later 
with a clean bill of health.

IF 




with no need to claim the second 
opinion which, with everything at 
stake, was his right. Bassick was 
waiting outside. 

“I’ve booked you a suite at the 
Venus.” 

“What’s that? Sounds like a 
high-class cathouse. What’s wrong 
with the Universe?” 

“They pulled it down twenty 
years ago to make way for a free- 
fall drome. The Venus is the latest 
and best in town.” Bassick’s hand 
twitched at his crewcut. “The oth- 
er service you — ah, mentioned in 
passing — is also available. That’s 
supposed to be the best in town, 
too.” 

Grant grimaced. Goodman had 
been much more pleasantly direct 
and brought out a selection, in 
assorted sizes and colors, direct to 
the field. 

“That’s something you have to 
get back into the habit of. All I 
want at this moment is a meal of 
real food, a bottle of real booze 
and a real bed. To myself.” 

II 

N HOUR before the press 
conference they had the parade 
in his suite. The usual train of 
facts and figures, stereo films, 
commentaries snipped from a hun- 
dred news items and documentaries 
— and models showing off the cur- 
rent fashions. 

The Sahara reclamation scheme 
was now completed. The trans- 



Austrailia monorail had been 
opened. A third generation had 
been born in Costeaupolis under 
the Mediterranean, including one 
child with what some excited scien- 
tists said were embryonic gills and 
others said were just accidents. A 
man had descended into the Red 
Spot of Jupiter and come out 
alive. 

The interest in organ replace- 
ment seemed unabated since last 
time, despite the fact that it only 
afforded a marginal extension of 
the normal life span. It simply 
made sure that most people attain- 
ed it. This time the ultimate 
seemed to have been accomplished 
with an operation on an Indonesian 
billionaire; his failure to survive 
more than six months had been 
ascribed to overexcitement rather 
than to anything more organic. 

Humanoid robots on a com- 
mercial basis were just around the 
corner. They’d been round the 
same corner thirty years before. 

Skirts^ if they could be called 
that, were back to the length — or 
shortness — of the twenty-one fif- 
ties. Worn with garters, which 
looked hideous to Grant’s eyes. 
The effect wasn’t improved when 
one model switched on a minia- 
ture radio in hers. 

But he did his best to be polite 
to the reporters who were ushered 
in on the dot of fifteen hundred 
hours. It was a routine that seemed 
to be wearing thin to him, but the 
company called it good P.R. 




THE LAST TIME AROUND 



95 




Yes, he thought the current 
fashions for women were very 
feminine. He liked the style of 
mauve suits for men but didn’t in- 
tend to buy one this leave. He had 
enough clothes. Some of them 
might look rather antique but he 
could always find something in 
the wardrobe like this— he gestured 
down to his dark jacket and slacks 
— that fitted in well enough. 

Yes, he thought robots might 
well be just around the corner. 
Did he think they would ever re- 
place men on spaceships? They 
might, but he didn’t see it person- 
ally. A spaceship was ninety-nine 
percent robot now, if not in hu- 
manoid shape. But it still needed a 
man to control, to initiate, to im- 
provise. 

He couldn’t pass comment on 
the gills — not his specialty. A 
primitive race he had encountered 
on Proxima Centauri Two had 
seemed to be in process of giving 
up the struggle on land and return- 
ing to an aquatic life. But that had 
been nearly two hundred years ago. 
The same old stale joke. The same 
stock laughter. 

It was like— the thought came 
to him, not for the first time — 
being a visitor to a foreign coun- 
try. 

This was your seventh trip. Cap- 
tain. The next one makes up the 
number, doesn’t it? 

Well, yes. Not the number. It’s 
the term that counts — twenty 
years. The trips get longer most of 



the time as we push out the fron- 
tiers. My successor will either 
make fewer trips or sign for a 
longer term. (He turned to Bas- 
sick, who flighted his palms in a 
noncommittal gesture.) 

Will there ever be true frontiers 
out there, men colonizing? He 
gave a loyal company yes to that, 
though sometimes he had doubts. 
But probably not in your lifetime. 
Nor even in mine. The same laugh- 
ter, a bit forced this time, the re- 
sentment of the time-bound against 
this strange elite of men who 
spanned centuries. But how many 
of them, given the choice, ^ould 
have made the same one he had 
made two hundred years ago? 

No, I don’t know yet where my 
last assignment will he. After I re- 
tire? I haven’t decided. An inner 
planet? I doubt it. My plans for 
this leave? Family? No, I have no 
family. (Which was not quite true, 
he confessed to himself with a 
pang, but as true as mattered.) 
Nor home town; that was Inun- 
dated in a reservoir scheme a cen- 
tury ago. No, I shall just loaf 
around, try to catch up with the 
world. Any more questions? 

There weren’t. 



A S THEY got up to leave a 
familiar figure entered, recog- 
nizable immediately even in a dark 
purple suit. No such company 
maneuvers as took place in Deep 
Space Incorporated plagued the 



96 



IF 




firm of Vandeleer and Vandeleer. 
Grant shook hands. 

“The eighth?” he inquired po- 
litely. 

“The ninth.” 

Grant smiled ruefully. “The 
memory must be slipping.” 

“Not at all. I’m afraid Dad 
died. Tragically. He was only 
twenty-eight. The Transworld 
Clipper collided with a freighter 
over the Caucasus.” 

“I’m very sorry. And sorry I 
never knew him. I should have re- 
alized. I thought you looked rath- 
er young.” 

“I try net to.” Richard Vande- 
leer IX laughed. “Your portfolio 
has given me a few premature gray 
hairs these past three years.” 

The room was empty now, the 
last to leave having been Bassick, 
who ushered out the drinks trolley. 

“How come?” 

“Well, first there was devalua- 
tion.” 

“Devaluation? Against what? I 
thought we had an integrated world 
currency now.” 

“Against gold. Integration 
brought its problems. They had to 
have sonys standard.” 

“Seems a bit primitive in this 
day and age. Did I lose much?” 

The other grinned. “I may have 
got pitcl forked into this at a ten- 
der age, but it’s in the Vandeleer 
blood. I had a hunch and bought 
Eurasian Gold Preferred three 
months before the switch. You 
made money out of it. It wasn’t 



so easy with the tax revisions they 
brought in just after. They were in- 
tended to rationalize the tax posi- 
tion of inner planet people. Some 
were being faced with double taxa- 
tion. It blew up in a freak case of 
somebody getting loaded with 
quadruple demands — for fifty per- 
cent more tax than he was earning. 

“I won’t go into technicalities, 
but the revision would have meant 
that you would have lost all your 
tax allowances here, without gain- 
ing them anywhere else. I don’t 
want to overplay my efforts — but 
it was tough going. When the ma- 
chine puts things right for a minor- 
ity of fifty thousand, it doesn’t 
want to be bothered with amend- 
ments to accommodate an even 
smaller minority of three.” 

“Especially,” Grant commented, 
“if said minority is rarely home at 
election times.” 

“Exactly. It took lobbying and 
a degree of — ” He gestured equiv- 
ocally with one hand. 

“Graft?” 

“Call it programing. Rather ex- 
pensive programing. Getting the 
right questions put at the right 
time in the right places. I was 
ready to fight it up to World Su- 
preme Court level if necessary, but 
that would have been even more 
expensive and time-consuming. I 
managed to straighten it out my 
way, but only just in time for your 
return.” 

He drew out a folder of papers 
from his briefcase. 



THE LAST TIME AROUND 



97 




“Despite that expense, you fin- 
ished half a million up on thirty- 
two years ago. In real terms, tak- 
ing into account the inevitable 
cost-of-living rise, you’re seven- 
teen point two five points ahead. 
Not a lot. I’m afraid, over that pe- 
riod, but in view of — ” 

Grant waved away his apologies. 
“You’ve done well. I’m satisfied.” 

The other was young enough to 
show his relief. “There are some 
papers here for you to sign.” He 
held out a pen. Grant signed with- 
out reading them. He trusted the 
firm of Vandeleer. He waited for 
the last paper to be handed over. 
Richard held it back. 

“And this one — I should have 
told you earlier.” He looked awk- 
ward. “1 can handle the financial 
angles. But I’m still callow at per- 
sonal details. This is a receipt for 
the estate of your only grandson. 
He — he died five years ago, with- 
out issue.” 

“I never expected him to have 
issue.” Grant laughed hollowly. 
“If that’s the right pronoun. Es- 
tate, you say?” 

“Only a few hundred dollars af- 
ter expenses.” 

“That’s something out of the af- 
fair, anyway.” He caught the look 
of embarrassment on the boy’s 
face. He was a member of a tight- 
knit dynasty, in which family ha- 
treds must be taboo. “I’m sorry. 
I’ve no right to be bitter. It was my 
fault. Have no fear, I shan’t repeat 
the mistake.” 



A MISTAKE? That was an un- 
derstatement. It had happened 
on the leave between his fourth 
and fifth trips, and he still couldn’t 
understand what had possessed 
him. There had always been 
enough women. He was under no 
illusion about his looks; he knew 
that to most women he was only 
an experience. A strange, enigma- 
tic being, pupils burned black in 
eyes honed white, hair bleached al- 
most as white against the deep tan 
that outer space radiation im- 
printed. A freakish and meretri- 
cious attraction, he knew, and it 
was better that way. The experi- 
ence over, most women passed on, 
asking nothing in return. 

There were the gold-diggers, of 
course, attracted by the news items 
about the wealth of DCP men. 
But gold-diggers employed law- 
yers, who soon dug out the fact 
that the wealth was more potential 
than real. The penalty clauses 
made sure of that, with the com- 
pany having first lien upon the 
lion’s share until the day when his 
service was completed and the dis- 
charge papers signed. More to the 
point, no amount of scheming 
could separate the money from a 
man who was going to outlive any 
gold-digger anyway. 

Helen had come in neither cate- 
gory. Yes, she had been undemand- 
ing — but making the more de- 
mands on him for that, because 
she had been helplessly in love with 
him. She had aroused in him the 



98 



IF 




worst thing possible for a man in 
his position — a sense of responsi- 
bility to another. Resisting it, he 
had tried to rationalize it into a 
conviction that he loved her in re- 
turn. They had married in a village 
in the Catskills. 

A week later the company ca- 
bled him notice of his next assign- 
ment. A long trip — longer than 
any he had made up to then, or 
since. A company decision, born 
of boardroom conferences and bal- 
ance sheets and time factors, had 
sent him out for forty years. 

He had come back to a Helen of 
sixty-seven, with a son whom she 
had tried pitifully to model after 
his father, cramming him to qual- 
ify in the same business. The son 
had had three, breakdowns; at forty 
he was a sad creature, older in all 
fact than his father, painting tenth- 
rate pictures in an attempt to jus- 
tify his living on the fund that 
Grant had set up for his wife. 

That would have been support- 
able. No man could be sure of his 
progeny. It had been far worse 
with Helen. 

He had been prepared for her 
kging; prepared loyally to do all 
that he could to make her happy, 
to make amends for the unnatural 
existence to which he had con- 
demned he *. He had not been pre- 
pared for a Helen determined craz- 
ily to pretend that time had stood 
still. A Helen who had used every 
artifice of twenty-second century 
cosmetic surgeons, who paraded 



before him to entice him, in the 
grotesque negligees of a world for- 
eign to him. 

It was that — the contradition in 
her craving to turn the clock back, 
yet needing the sustainment of the 
latest fashions in order to feel 
young — that symbolized the un- 
bridgeable gulf between them. 
That, more than the old body be- 
hind the cosmetic facade, the minc- 
ing, imploring gestures, that sent 
him fleeing from her. 

The long mistake was over, then. 
But he winced in pain at the mem- 
ory of it and felt like an execution- 
er as he signed the document. 

He sighed heavily. “Well, if 
that’s all the business, let’s go 
downstairs and have a drink. You 
are old enough to drink, aren’t 
you?” 

Richard Vandeleer the Ninth 
looked up from zipping his case. 
“Try me.” 

T WO large drinks later Grant 
felt no better. The surround- 
ings didn’t help, the fluorescent 
patterns changing and swirling 
over the walls of the huge bar. 
They might be the latest thing in 
decoration but they weren’t restful 
to eyes that had not had the dec- 
ades to get used to them. 

But it wasn’t the present that dis- 
turbed him — and he wasn’t sure 
whether it was the past or future 
which did. In thirty, forty years— 
of Earth time; two or three of his 
own — he would be back on Earth 



THE LAST TIME AROUND

permanently. The comparison that 
had entered his head at the press 
conference — that he was a stranger 
in a foreign country — returned to 
him. One could spend a few 
months’ holiday in a foreign coun- 
try and be diverted by its different 
customs, the strange language. 

But to settle there? 

He drained his drink. There was 
an answer to the feeling, if not to 
the final problem — the old answer 
of inoculation, a smaller dose of 
the larger disease. He snapped his 
fingers to a waiter. The man came 
running. 

“A gazetteer,” Grant told him. 

The man blinked. “I’m sorry, 
sir. If that’s some kind of a new 
drink — or an old one. I’m afraid I 
— oh, a gazetteer?” 

Grant nodded. “A world one.” 

“I’m not sure if the hotel has 
one, sir.” 

Grant held up a hundred-dollar 
bill. “Find one.” 

It arrived inside five minutes, 
looking and smelling straight from 
the bookstore as Grant opened it 
at random. He stabbed a blind fin- 
ger to the page. 

“Biarritz. Department of the 
Basse-Pyrenees. Historic resort, 
made fashionable by the English in 
the nineteenth century. Population 

He looked up at Richard. 

Richard gazed at him for a long 
moment, with a sympathy beyond 
his years. “I’ll arrange the flight. 
And a good hotel” He drained his 



own drink. “All a part of the ser- 
vice.” 

“You’re a true Vandeleer,” 
Grant told him quietly. “One re- 
quest, though.” The walls were 
flaming orange now. “Make it a 
small hotel?” 

Ill 

T WO weeks in the French town 
did much to restore his spir- 
its. Heaven knew where Richard 
had found the hotel, LAuberge 
Basque. It was surely too small to 
be listed in any travel guide; a fam- 
ily affair of a dozen rooms, a zinc- 
topped bar and a small restaurant. 
The owner, M. Vidal, was a lean 
man who smoked black French 
cigarettes in a holder he carried at 
a jaunty angle. He discarded it at 
intervals to serve — and help con- 
sume — meals that belied his ascetic 
lines. 

The inn was typical of the town. 
In an international world it still re- 
tained an essentially French flavor. 
If itself one of the first of the in- 
ternational resorts — some of the 
old buildings still bore English 
names — the tide had swept over it 
and on. Few skyscrapers had en- 
croached here. 

The month was September, and 
he was less noticeable — less differ- 
ent — here, where everybody was 
deeply tanned. Resort clothes 
seemed never to change much; they 
didn’t jar the eye like the bizarre 
fashions of New York. He spent 



100 



IF 




his days strolling on the yellow 
sands, watching the breakers com- 
ing in; occasionally, as the mood 
took him, going out to ride on 
them. His evenings he spent sip- 
ping drinks on the terrace of one 
cafe or another, listening to velvet- 
panted French kids strum out an- 
cient French songs on guitars. He 
found his palate adapting to the 
same acrid cigarettes whose scent 
was part of the air of the place, to 
aniseed-flavored Pernod. 

It was a peaceful life, the peak 
of its excitement a modest flutter 
at the roulette tables of the casino. 
The greater gamble that was his 
life, his future, became more and 
more remote every day. Until . 

He came back to the inn for 
dinner and had to pass her table to 
reach his own. The tables were set 
close in the tiny restaurant. He 
said, ** Pardonnez-moi, madame,"" 
in his poor French, then, such was 
his uncertainty with the language 
and its manners, added a suffix of 
-oiselle, making grotesque the sim- 
ple word. 

The gold-haloed head turned. 
Amber eyes looked up at him. 
Red lips parted in a warm smile. 
“7^ vous en prie,"" she said. 

In the bar after dinner only one 
stool was vacant and it was next to 
hers. He said “C'e5r libreV and 
she answered, “You’re welcome.’’ 

The words were American but 
the accent was unmistakably Eng- 
lish. 

It happened as simply as that. 



As fatally. 

Her name was Etta — Etta War- 
ing. An ancestor of hers had writ- 
ten a diary of life here in the days 
before the first World War. She 
herself had just finished an inter- 
national congress in Barcelona and 
had driven across here out of curi- 
osity. She was an anthropologist, 
a doctor. 

He told her that he was a doc- 
tor, too, of physical science. And 
she said, “Reminds me of the story 
by — Thurber, was it? — one of the 
classical humorists — no, Leacock. 
He was a doctor of literature. 
Aboard ship, a blonde nicked an 
ankle and the call went out for a 
doctor. Leacock rushed to her 
cabin but found that a doctor of 
divinity had beaten him by a short 
head.” 

. They laughed together and the 
danger point — talk of their occu- 
pations — was past without his hav- 
ing had to reveal — or conceal — 
the exact nature of his work. 

They went surfing or planing 
over the calmer waters of St. Jean- 
de-Luz along the coast — or just 
lazed by the old port of Bayonne, 
watching the fishermen unload 
their immemorial freight. They 
were days made rich by simple 
pleasures. 

One day they drove in her rep- 
lica E-Type Jaguar up into the 
Pyrenees, to the places of cold wa- 
terfalls and ancient villages. They 
stayed in one village, in an inn 
even tinier than the Auberge

Basque and a room quaint with 
carved beams. 

And he knew then with a dread- 
ful certainty that he had come full 
circle — back to bitter memories, 
of mountains humbler than these, 
of a village less ancient, an inn . 

And this time threatened to be 
even more bitter, for now it was 
heartbreakingly sweet — and this 
time it was mutual. At breakfast 
he knew that he had to tell her. At 
what should have been a time of 
quiet intimacy, of few words, over 
croissants and wild cherry conserve 
and coffee, he had to introduce the 
shockingly incongruous subject of 
his work. 

H e pushed his plate aside 
and, early as it was, ordered 
cognac. Etta’s eyebrows rose but 
she did not demur. He tried to set- 
tle himself but the words still came 
out hopelessly awkward. 

“You know — who I am? My 
job, I mean. You don’t . .’’ 

She smiled gently. “What, read 
the popular magazines? No, hard- 
ly at all. I didn’t know who you 
were. I do now. I wrote home to 
my people to tell them about you. 
I hope you don’t mind. They told 
me. They recognized you from the 
name and the description I gave 
them of you.” 

“And they disapproved?” 
“Disapproved? Whyever should 
they?” She smiled again. “I’m a 
big girl, anyway. I’m thirty-three.” 
“Thirty-three,” he said, his face 



strange. “Yes, you told me. But 
you don’t know the whole of it, 
obviously, or you wouldn’t talk 
about it so calmly.” 

“What — the subjective time fac- 
tor? Yes.” 

“But you can’t know the full im- 
plications. For us. Unless you do 
feel the same way I do, don’t you?” 
“Do you have to ask?” 

“That’s all we seem to be doing 
— asking questions. There’s no an* 
swer, you know.” 

“Every question has an answer.” 
“You, a scientist, can say that?” 
“Because I’m a scientist — yes. 
In time.” 

“Don’t mention that word 
again.” He tried to smile. 

“Couldn’t I go along with you 
this last trip? With my scientific'* 
training I — ” 

“You’d be payload. Anthropol- 
ogy is the least required subject — 
the least profitable line.” 
“Profitable? I thought it was a 
government project. You mean 
it’s a commercial thing?” 

“So far it is. There are no divi- 
dends for any government in it yet. 
Inner-planet traffic is a govern- 
ment-backed thing. There are still 
remnants of military thinking be- 
hind that, of national advantage. 
There isn’t, of course, but the blocs 
are committed to it. At a consider- 
able loss. Every assembly in the 
world has a strong anti-space 
lobby. No government that values 
its survival could afford to take the 
risk in deep space yet.”

IF 




It was a relief to talk about im- 
personal things for a moment. 

“For Deep Space Incorporated 
it’s a long-term project. So long- 
term and needing so many billions 
of capital that they’re the only firm 
in the business so far — after two 
hundred years. They sell the knowl- 
edge we bring back — to research 
foundations, other companies — 
but that doesn’t pay for half of it. 
They’re gambling on being the first 
in the field, with perfected tech- 
niques, inyreadiness for the day 
when it rqmly opens up out there. 
If it opens up. It’s a big gamble. 

“What we do is to extend those 
techniques — and our knowledge of 
deep space — system by system. If 
one of us found a civilization out 
there comparable to ours things 
would open up in a heck of a hur- 
ry. Everybody knows now that that 
was the whole impetus behind 
man’s hunger to get to the planets 
— to find a companion race, a 
touchstone. Even the remains of 
one. But they didn’t. Nor have we 
among the nearer stars. Just a few 
primitive species. Valuable to the 
biologists but nothing developed 
enough to be of interest to your 
field— 

He was swinging back to person- 
al matters now. And it could be de- 
ferred no . onger. 

“I’m payload enough. Every 
item of expenditure is costed down 
to a cent. The pay isn’t huge by 
objective time standards. It just 
piles up while I’m away. But even 



I couldn’t afford to commission a 
passenger — even you.” 

“Couldn’t you pull out now?” 

“I could.” He told het, briefly, ^ 
about the penalty clauses. “It 
would mean coming out with a 
few thousand dollars — to start all 
over again on.” 

“Money’s not that important. I 
have money, anyway.” 

“No — the money’s not impor- 
tant. And it’s not the main factor 
in all this. Completing my mission 
is. I wouldn’t call myself a com- 
pany man — companies seem pretty 
small things out there in space — 
but I dedicated myself to this job. 

I have to go through with it.” 

“I understand,” she said quietly. 
“Neither could I give up my work 
— even for us.” 

“In your case it wouldn’t be the 
same either-or choice. There could 
be a compromise. There’s no com- 
promise in this.” He sniacked fist 
impotently into palm. “Why 
should this have had to happen 
now? The last time around?” 

She laid a hand on his. “It’s 
hard — terribly hard. I’ve known 
for three days. I knew it would 
make difficulties. I haven’t let it 
spoil things.” 

“You didn’t know the full facts.” 
“I knew enough. I won’t let it 
spoil things now.” 

“Then you can accept it, accept 
— us — as something transient?” 

“It doesn’t have to be. You’ll 
be away — how long? Twenty, thir- 
ty years. I’m prepared — ” 



THE LAST TIME AROUND

“No. I tried that once. It doesn’t 
work. It couldn’t work.” 

He got up and paced the little 
room. The sun, moving between 
peaks, sent a sudden shaft through 
the unshuttered windows, drown- 
ing the room in light. 

She stood up and came to his 
side, her hair a golden haze. 

“Then we’ll just have to accept 
it,” she said quietly. 

“Easy words.” 

“I know, my darling. Easy and 
shockingly inadequate. But what 
more can we say? Or do? We’ll 
have memories. Hell, why do the 
simplest and truest things always 
sound so corny? But we mil have. 
And we can — ” She stopped 
abruptly. “How much longer have 
we got?” 

“Four, five weeks. At least — ” 
the thought impinged “ — I have.” 

“Then so have I. A new aca- 
demic year starts soon, but the 
University can do without me for 
that long. And I without the Uni- 
versity.” Her tone was flippant 
but her look, as she gazed at him, 
was one of utter tenderness. 

He took her into his arms and 
she was trembling. “I’ve always 
been glad to get back into space. 
Every time I’ve felt more and 
more a stranger on Earth. This 
time it’s going to seem very lonely 
out there.” He laughed sadly. “7/5 
a fine and private place, but none 
I think do there embrace.'" 

“That’s not quite what the poet 
said.” 



“I know. He said the grave. 
That’s one place where all rates of 
time become equal. The only one.” 
“Let’s not get morbid.” She 
kissed him once and long. “We’ve 
still got a lot of living to do. Let’s 
get back to the big city.” 

But she was abstracted, saying 
not a word unless prompted and 
then only answering in monosyl- 
lables, all the way back to town, 
driving along the narrow moun- 
tain roads like an automaton. 

When they got back he found a 
cable waiting for him. He was sure 
she noticed — sure she guessed 
what it was — but she made no 
comment. Up in his room he 
opened it. He did a simple sum, 
made even simpler by practice. He 
would be away for thirty-four 
years of Earth time. Two and a 
half of his own. It could have been 
worse. But when he came back for 
the last time he would be forty- 
five. Etta would be sixty-seven. 
Exactly the same age that Helen 
had been. 

T he next morning he was up 
before eight. He knocked on 
her door. There was no answer. He 
shrugged; early as it was, she must 
have gone down to breakfast be- 
fore him. He went down and to 
the table they had shared ever since 
that first night. She was not there 
either. He saw an envelope with 
his name on it. 

He felt suddenly empty. He 
pulled back the curtains. Her car

IF 




was gone from the tiny, graveled 
parking lot. He brought himself to 
open the envelope. 

Beloved, 

I’ve taken the dawn flight 
to London. I don’t know just 
how long I’ll be. No more 
than a fortnight, I hope. 
Dreadfully sorry to cut into 
our time — that bloody word 
again! — like this, but it’s for 
a good cause, believe me. I 
can’t tell you -any more until 
I get back — and perhaps not 
even then if this doesn’t work. 

Don’t pick up any blonde 
English anthropologists while 
I’m away. Or anyone else! 
And please — wait for me, 
beloved.

T he crippled days dragged 
along. He drank more Per- 
nods than usual, spent more time 
at the casino, found that he could 
not face the sea. Its emptiness was 
too much an image of the lack in 
his life. 

' Twelve days later she reappeared 
as abruptly as she had left. Her 
car was back in the lot and she 
was waiting for him at their table 
when he ca ne in for dinner. 

They looked at each other for a 
moment. Then she was out of her 
chair and in his arms, saying, 
“Darling — darling.” The French 



in the dining room smiled as the 
French have always smiled at lov- 
ers, tolerantly, sympathetically, 
the old nostalgically. 

“We can’t talk here,” he told 
her. “Have you eaten?” 

She shook her head. “I 
couldn’t.” 

“Nor could I, now.” He led her 
onto the terrace. Somebody 
brought out glasses and a bottle of 
Pernod. Grant poured the drinks, 
watching them turn to milk as he 
added ice and water. He brought 
his eyes up at length to hers. 

“I’ve decided — no, I couldn’t 
bring myself to do that — I’m ready 
to let you decide. If you say so 
I’ll go back on my contract. I’ve 
had a lot of time to think it over 
while you’ve been away. The com- 
pany won’t lose that badly. They’ll 
have a reserve pilot ready. I — ” 

She shook her head slowly, halt- 
ing his words. 

“That’s something I wouldn’t 
hear of. I wouldn’t before and I 
won’t now. Besides, darling, it’s 
too late.” 

“Too late? What’s happened? 
Why did you leave for London in 
such a hurry?” 

“To have an illegal operation.” 
She spoke the words coolly. 

“A — what?” 

“Well, not illegal exactly. Not 
yet sanctioned. It’s a new tech- 
nique and all kinds of social prob- 
lems are involved. You know the 
way we English always worry 
about the social problems. The

whole thing only took Hve days, 
from the start to the final checks 
to prove that it had taken. But I 
had to spend the best part of a 
week inducing the doctors to do 
it.” 

“Please — don’t keep darting 

around the subject like this. Opera- 
tion? What operation? What have 
you had done to yourself?” 

“You make it sound like some- 
thing dreadful.” She smiled. “And 
sad. It wasn’t, because of my mo- 
tive in having it done, though I sup- 
pose it could be.” The smile be- 
came wry. “The ward was a fine 
and private place, but none I think 
did there embrace. They see the 
process as having most use in per- 
petuating intelligence. It’s ironical, 
really, that it should have been 
used in this case to serve the cause 
of lovers.” 

“For heaven’s sake. Your blast- 
ed English cool — ” 

“It’s not easy to tell. Briefly — 
I’ve arranged that you will find me 
waiting for you when you come 
back, unchanged by the years.” 

Appalled, his mind lurched back 
to Helen , and her pitiful attempts 
to defeat time and its passing. 
“You can’t. I’ll be away for thirty- 
four years.” 

Her smile became enigmatic as 
she made a pretense of counting on 
her fingers. “Fine. I’ll be a slightly 
younger Etta waiting for you. By 
a few months.” ‘ 

“What’s happened to you? I 
thought I knew you. When did this 



sadistic streak creep in?” His voice 
was baffled rather than bitter. 

“I’m sorry, darling, really I am. 
I’m not being sadistic — Just a lit- 
tle shy. I’ll have to come out with 
it. I’m going to have a baby.” 

“You’re—” 

“Don’t be appalled. Just listen 
carefully while I say it again. I’m 
going to have a baby.” 

“But—” 

“I told you it was a new tech- 
nique. Do I have to go into the de- 
tails?” She sighed. “I suppose I do 
have. 

“Well, it’s not really a new tech- 
nique; only for humans. It was first 
done back in the nineteen sixties 
by an Oxford team led by a Dr. 
Gurdon, with — if I have to bring 
them into this — frogs. They found 
that if they transplanted the nucle- 
us of an ordinary body cell into an 
egg killed by radiation — its own 
nucleus killed — the egg developed 
just like a fertilized one. The cell 
and the egg from the same crea- 
ture. They’ve only recently discov- 
ered how to do the same thing suc- 
cessfully to a human being. Now 
do you see?” 

His mental defenses, over- 
whelmed, would not allow him to 
see it. He listened dazedly as she 
went on. 

“I told you that you will find 
me waiting for you. You will. It 
will be me — exactly the same. 
Even to the name. I’ll christen her 
Etta, too, naturally. And don’t 
worry about its being anything else

but a girl. That presents no diffi- 
culty these days, with this or any 
other birth.” 

Light filtered through — was 
suddenly blinding. 

“But — it won’t be you. To me it 
will be but — ” 

“But that’s all that matters. We 
can’t both of us meet again — but 
this way one of us can.” She 



laughed but she was close to tears, 
he knew, “If you see what I mean. 
It can come true for one of us.” 

“I — I can’t find the words.” 
“Don’t try, my darling.” 

“I must. I feel selfish — more 
selfish than I could have believed a 
man could feel. You went away 
and did — this — and while you were 
gone I couldn’t even come to a de-

cision, except to leave it to you to 
decide. I feel the worst kind of 
a — ” 

She put a finger to his lips. 

“No, my dear, you’re not the 
worst kind of anything. You’re the 
best kind of something very special. 
And you’re not selfish. Society is 
selfish in demanding what it has 
from you, without even recognizing 
the extent of your sacrifice. Ex- 
cept—’’ 

“No,’’ he said. “You can’t use 
that word for me after what you’ve 
done. Yours is the sacrifice. I’m 
not — ’’ 

“Please — let me go on. I insist. 
Except by treating you as some 
kind of a freak. I had plenty of 
time, in the ward, to catch up on 
the popular papers. Plenty of time 
to realize just what life must have 
been like for you. That only sus- 
tained me in my decision. I’m glad 
to have done it — glad with all my 
heart.- So please don’t protest any 
more. It was the only way — and it 
was a happy chance that this way 
existed and that I knew about it 
and was in a position to argue my 
way through to taking it.’’ 

“But — I won’t protest — but how 
do you know that she’ll even like 
me? One sacrifice is enough. You 
can’t condemn a child to growing 
up to a foreordained point in her 
life, and then — it’s a terrible com- 
pulsion to impose on a human be- 
mg. 

She smiled but her lips trembled 
as she did so. 



“It won’t be a compulsion, be- 
loved, but a dream to live for. A 
realization. She will have the ad- 
vantage on me. I didn’t know, liv- 
ing my years out, just what I was 
waiting for. She will. And she will 
fall in love with you just as I did. 
Because she’ll be me. Not an ordi- 
nary child, with all the genetic com- 
plications of joint parenthood, but 
my image.’’ 

He stared. 

“But she won’t have your mem- 
ories — of anything — of us.’’ 

“How do you think I will spend 
my days while you’re away? I’ll 
keep them alive, pass them on to 
my daughter. My daughter. It’s a 
pity that it won’t be our daughter. 
But next time around you can 
make even that come true.” 

She turned her face away from 
him suddenly, hiding it in the cool 
leaf shadows of the terrace. But 
when, after long moments, she 
turned back to him she was man- 
aging to smile. 

“And who knows? The records 
are still scanty on this — but that 
memory might be transmitted di- 
rectly through this kind of direct 
reproduction. Part of me may be 
waiting for you, too. So let’s have 
enough talk of sacrifices. And 
there are memories still to make. 
We haven’t even started our drinks. 
Look, the ice has nearly all 
melted.” 

She lifted her glass and waited, 
her face quite serene now, until he 
lifted his. •

T he helicopter tossed the de- 
sert sunshine off its blades in 
sudden circular explosions and its 
shadow moved flatly across the 
sand far below. 

“Down there,” said Spenser, 
leaning toward the cut-out door 
and pointing with a hand. His voice 
was loud and high-pitched to be 
heard over the clatter of the 
blades. “Di-rectly down there.” 
Dr. Bunyan inclined his head and 
gazed a thousand feet down, to 
where a huge purple stain spread 
out on the desert floor like a port 
wine mark on a sandy cheek. “The 
exact center of the dissonance. We 
mapped it this week. Dropped the 
dye canisters yesterday after- 
noon.” Dr. Bunyan stared up at 
the New Mexico sky and nodded, 
saying nothing. Spenser tapped the 
pilot on the shoulder and the heli- 
copter swung about, around the 
axis of the main blades and tilted, 
accelerating back in the direction 
it had come from. Spenser turned 
his head and looked back to watch 
the huge stain disappear into the 
faint haze and then around the 
curve of the earth. Dr. Bunyan 
continued to stare at the immense 
blue sky, until a motion of the 
helicopter brought the sun over the 
cabin roof and into the cockpit 
windshield. 

D r. Bunyan stood up and 
walked slowly to the window, 
looking out between the dusty Ven- 
etian blinds. Spenser sat l^hind 



hi$ small desk and rolled a me- 
chanical pencil back and forth. 

“It’s not a matter of what I 
think, you understand.” Dr. Bun- 
yan ran one finger along a metal 
slat. “It’s that the thinking in 
Washington has changed. We no 
longer talk in terms of what is in- 
teresting, what is worthy of pure 
research. No. Not that at all.” He 
rubbed one eye against the sunlight 
and his gray hair caught and re- 
flected the ribbed brightness from 
the window. “We must think of re- 
source allocations — that’s the 
phrase they use now. You’ve heard 
it, haven’t you?” 

Spenser nodded listlessly, not 
looking up from the mechanical 
pencil that rolled steadily between 
his hands. 

“Resource allocations — the lib- 
erals make it a matter of moral- 
ity, plain and simple morality. 
Saying, ‘Well, what good is this 
going to do for mankind?’ ” Dr. 
Bunyan gestured expansively, lib- 
erally, with his hands. “And we 
can’t talk to them in pure research 
terms. It’s morality for them, re- 
source allocations.” He shook his 
head, turning from the window, 
and sat down in the single other 
chair in the office, gazing not un- 
kindly at Spenser. 

Spenser shifted uncomfortably 
and coughed into his hand. “The 
dye marks the. exact center of the 
magnetic dissonance — there’s no 
doubt about that. Before now it 
couldn’t have been done.” He 



110 



IF 




smiled weakly and put the pencil 
in his jacket pocket. 

Dr. Bunyan nodded and placidly 
folded his hands. “I appreciate 
that. It’s a fine accomplishment. 
But it took two months and eight 
hundred thousand dollars. Can I 
go back to Washington and tell 
them they bought a purple spot on 
the desert for nearly a million dol- 
lars?” He spread his hands: a mute 
portrayal of the forces he battled. 

Spenser snorted and stood up. 
“Come now, Doctor. Let’s be 
adult about this. That purple spot 
marks the center of a sudden dis- 
sonance measured in the magnetic 
flux of the northern hemisphere. 
Three months ago i held the Stein- 
berg research professorship in geo- 
physics at Princeton. 1 worked 
thirty-five years to get there. I 
didn’t leave it for a purple spot on 
the desert. This is significant re- 
search, Dr. Bunyan, not a game.” 

Dr. Bunyan nodded violently in 
agreement and stood up quickly, 
walked to the metal desk and 
leaned on it with both hands. “We 
realize that.” His unbuttoned 
jacket flapped loosely. “I respect 
your reputation more than any- 
one. But I’m trying to tell you as 
gently as I can that there may just 
be no more money forthcoming 
for this iy,)t of research. That’s 
the way jt is. I can’t change that.” 

Spenser stood facing a black- 
board, his back to Bunyan. He put 
one fist up to his mouth and held 
it there tensely. “I didn’t under- 



stand that. I thought there was a 
great deal of enthusiasm for this 
project.” 

“There is Edmund, there is. I 
assure you. But we’re not as rich 
as we once were. We’ve used up 
things we’ll never have again. It’s 
time to allocate resources.” Spen- 
ser said nothing, and after a time 
Dr. Bunyan eased back into the 
chair and crossed his legs. 

440HEE-1T, BOY. I ain’t never 
^seen nothing like.” 

One burro became restless and 
stepped into the wide purple circle. 
The boy pulled it back quickly. He 
was perhaps six inches shorter 
than his father. The bottoms of 
his blue jeans were rolled up thick- 
ly around his boots. 

The older man pushed his wide- 
brimmed black hat back farther 
and wiped his forehead with a 
sweaty arm. “Never seen nothing 
like this — that’s the truth. Just 
overnight, too. Weren’t here yes- 
taddy, was it boy?” 

The boy shook his head. “I 
come out here early yestaddy, first 
thing in the morning, wasn’t noth- 
ing then.” He stared out at the 
other side of the bright purple 
splotch. “Must be fifty, sixty feet 
’cross. Pa. Wouldn’t you say 
.that?” 

Pa leaned back on the burro and 
scratched his armpit slowly, con- 
templatively. “I’d say that at least, 
boy, at least.” He pursed his lips 
and the expression made the stub-

ond word — “ain’t a natchel thing, 
not at all.’’ 

The boy squatted down and 
picked up a handful of the purple 
sand. “Just up here on top Pa. It 
don’t go down very far. Like paint, 
Pa.” 

Pa laughed, his head jerking 
back and the muscles of his neck 
bunching like rocks under the skin. 
“Nobody gonna come out this far 
to paint a purple circle in the des- 
ert. That don’t make no sense.” 
His smile faded and he coughed 
once and frowned. “But why is it 
right here boy? Why right here? 
That can’t be no coinceedence.” 

The boy gauged the distance 
with his eye. “It’s right around it, 
no mistake. Like somebody knew. 
Pa, knew just where it was.” He 
shook his head and looked out 
over the desert floor. Far to the 
north gray mountains rose like 
tiny piles of clay. To the south the 
mountains disappeared under the 
horizon. “Sure is a mystery. Pa.” 

S penser went through the 
charts quickly, pointing out the 
increasing refinement of the map- 
ping technique. His hands shook 
slightly and a thin line of sweat had 
formed on his upper lip: it re- 
mained unevaporated in the air- 
conditioning of the small office. 

Dr. Bunyan noted each chart 



with polite interest, asking an oc- 
casional question. His dark blue 
suit was still perfectly pressed, 
even after a full day in the New 
Mexico heat. “Truly marvelous,” 
he said finally. “Very fine work.” 

Spenser nodded absently, run- 
ning his fingers over the carefully 
colored surface. 

“But no explanation for the dis- 
sonance yet? Not even ah — ” he 
glanced up at the ceiling — “a pre- 
liminary finding I can take back to 
the department?” 

Spenser hit the charts with the 
back of his hand. “Explanation? 
We just found the place! Mon- 
day we’re sending out equipment 
to start digging. At least give us 
the time to do the excavation. 
We’re budgeted for that,” he added 
with slight bitterness, rolling the 
charts back up tightly with both 
hands. 

“Just some educated guesses 
then. What might do it?” 

Spenser turned and gazed past 
Dr. Bunyan. “Nothing. Nothing 
could do it — cause that disso- 
nance. There is no possible expla- 
nation. Six months ago there was a 
shift in the magnetic field. Slight, 
but still compasses from the Aleu- 
tians to Greenland moved several 
seconds. No seismic activity here. 
Not even minutely enough ferrous 
material to explain things — assum- 
ing there was an earthquake.” 

Dr. Bunyan chewed delicately at 
a fingernail and stared at Spenser 
silently. 



112 



IF 




“It is an entirely new phenomen- 
on. It may explain a great deal.” 
He shrugged and adjusted his 
glasses. “Or it may raise a million 
new questions. But it deserves to 
be investigated.” He turned back 
abruptly to the charts, avoiding 
Bunyan’s eye. 

Dr. Bunyan nodded and gestured 
weakly with one hand. “If it were 
my money I’d have no hesitation. 
But — ” He let the sentence die in 
the flat air-conditioning. 

“If it were your money,” said 
Spenser in a flat voice, sliding the 
charts into a cardboard tube, 
“you’d put it in a Swiss bank and 
move to Bermuda. So would I.” 

Bunyan laughed with faint em- 
barrassment and followed Spenser 
out of the room. 

L ate that night the boy stared 
up at the ceiling from the top 
bunk, his nose less than a foot 
from the rough boards that al- 
lowed narrow slices of moonlight 
entrance on occasional nights. He 
slept in a long flannel shirt against 
the sudden cold of the desert. “It’s 
only been six months. Pa, and it 
turns puil^le. Don’t seem right.” 

Pa leaned back in his chair and 
put one boot sideways on the ta- 
ble. He lifted an aluminum cup to 
his lips. ' It didn’t turn purple. 
Somebody turned it purple. We 
find ’em we oughta kick shit outta 
’em.” He nodded to himself. “Kick 
shit.” 

The boy reached behind his head 



with one hand and felt the Bible, 
foursquared underneath the pillow. 
“Pa, could it be a signT' 

“A what, boy?” He squinted up 
and saw only narrow lines of 
moonlight. 

“A sign.” The boy paused and 
cleared his throat. “From the 
Lord.” 

“Hmmmm. Huh.” The sound 
rumbled deep in his chest, and he 
drank from the aluminum cup 
again. “Don’t think so, boy. The 
Lord, He woulda made it purple 
all the way through, not just up on 
top. He woulda made it brighter, 
too. Glowing, you know.” 

The boy nodded slightly to him- 
self. “I was thinking that, too. 
That it wasn’t quality enough for 
the Lord.” He pulled the flannel 
shirt around him and turned to the 
wall. 

Pa stared up at the picture above 
the table, the woman smiling down 
shyly in faded black and white, the 
crucifix hanging next to it, in dark- 
ening ivory plastic. He drained the 
aluminum cup and set it squarely 
in the center of the table and sat 
for a long while, seeing nothing. 

S penser struck his wife full 
across the face twice that night, 
the second blow sending her back- 
ward into the pressboard-and-for- 
mica nightstand that separated the 
two motel beds. He had struck her 
before — occasionally as a gradu- 
ate student, he recalled — but less 
the last few years at Princeton. 



SHE STILL DO 



113 




Both times this night in New 
Mexico she refused to cry. The 
second time, after hitting the night- 
stand, her leg bled slightly, and the 
sight of the blood made Spenser 
sickened and guilty. He went out- 
side and sat on a stack of wooden 
boxes next to the cold-drink ma- 
chine for fifteen minutes before the 
chill infiltrated his bathrobe and he 
felt forced to go back inside. 

“Damn,” he said to the locked 
bathroom door. “Damn. Leaving 
Princeton was a dumb-ass mis- 
take.” 

Silence. 

He looked around the small 
motel room they had rented for 
the last two months, uncertain as 
to the future of the project. “This 
is all a mistake. We’ll go back. 
It’ll be fine.” He felt unsatisfied by 
the words. He went to lie down on 
the bed, staring up at the ceiling, 
his hands behind his head. The 
bathroom door stayed closed. 

T he dawn spread in the east like 
smeared fingerpaints. 
“Privacy,” said Pa, tying the 
shovel with thick hemp rope to the 
blanketed side of the burro. “No 
damn privacy any more. You 
know that boy? No privacy.” 

The boy nodded, finishing a knot 
and pulling on his shovel to see if 
it would slip. 

Pa coughed violently, raspingly, 
and when he finished they headed 
north, figuring to reach the huge 



purple stain before the real heat of 
the day grew up out of the sand. 

AMN,” said Spenser. Faint 

fragments of the weekend 
still stuck to him, a headache, a 
toothache, loud voices and broken 
sleep. “Goddamn sonofabitch.” 
The bank of instruments rose a 
full foot over his head — the slowly 
unrolling tongues of the oscillo- 
graphs, the nodding needles of me- 
ters, the flashing pupils of digital 
readouts, the nervous traces of 
dark green oscilloscope screens. 
Spenser rested his forehead against 
a barely warm metal surface. “It 
can’t have moved.” He shook his 
head, eyes closed. “There is no 
way for it to have moved.’’ He 
tapped his fingers on a plastic 
shelf. “It’s a new instrument,” he 
told the operator. “The array 
must be damaged somehow. Birds 
or lightning.” He knew that it had 
been clear weather and that birds 
could never be magnetic. He shook 
his head again. “Send someone up 
to check it. We’ll hold the truck 
until we’re sure.” 



T here was faint, continual 
static on the telephone line to 
Washington. 

“It’s a setback. Dr. Bunyan. But 
it is by no means hopeless.” 

1 see. 

“There are setbacks in every 
worthwhile project. We’ve been 
very lucky up until now.” 



114 



IF 




“That’s certainly true.” 

“We’ll simply relocate it and 
send out the excavators a little lat- 
er in the week. Say, Thursday.” 
“Well. Whatever is within your 
budget.” 

“That is the difficulty Dr. Bun- 
yan. We may need a slight exten- 
sion. Dr. Bunyan?” 

“Still here. Ah. Do whatever 
you can within your present budg- 
et and I’ll see if I can get some 
provisional financing. No prom- 
ises.” 

“I didn’t expect any.” 

“Fine. As long as we understand 
each other.” 

“It moved,” said Spenser, sitting 
on the bed. His wife stared at him 
momentarily in the mirror and 
looked back at her hair. “The 
damn thing moved. Just like that. 
Over the weekend, it moved.” 

Mrs. Spenser shook her head 
very slightly. “My goodness.” 
“Your goodness,” he said, his 
hand jerking so that an ice cube 
bounced out of the glass he held 
and fell onto the carpet. “We’ll 
find it tomorrow.” He nodded, 
rocking back and forth. “We’ll 
have it marked out by noon. 
There’ll bfe an extension, for sure. 
Bunyan’s a good man. He’s on our 
side.” 



Spenser stood up and walked to 
the dresser, remembering a mo- 
ment too late that the bottle stood 
on the nightstand. His wife laughed 
gently into the mirror — he noticed 
but chose to ignore her. 



4tTn RIANGULATE,” said 
A Spenser into the micro- 
phone. “If I don’t have your read- 
ings every ten seconds we’ll do this 
all day.” He handed the micro- 
phone back to the radio operator 
and the three planes began to re- 
port a series of figures. Spenser 
noted each one on a map and si- 
multaneously it was typed into a 
land line that ran to Phoenix. 

The planes flew a gradually con- 
verging pattern in the blue New 
Mexico sky, slicing twenty feet of 
airspace off an imaginary triangle 
with each turn. Next to Spenser a 
teletype rattled. The computer cal- 
culated loci of the three separate 
figures he received. Shaded areas 
on the map gradually grew small- 
er. Spenser used his yellow slide 
rule frequently at first, then in- 
creasingly less as the increments of 
change became so small that he 
was forced to rely on the computer 
readout for useful accuracy. Final-

ly a single point remained, nearly a 
mile from the original mark. 

He touched the radio operator 
on the shoulder. “Fine. We’ve got 
it. Bring two home and have the 
third drop the canisters.” 

“Wind north-northwest eight 
knots,” said the operator. Far out 
on the desert a small Cessna 
headed directly into the path of the 
light wind and two cylindrical met- 
al containers fell from the window. 
They twisted slightly in the air and 
landed, exploding on impact, sev- 
eral feet apart in the hot brown 
sand. 

T he sun. was high, still faintly 
obscured by thin dry clouds. Pa 
took his hat off and ran a finger 
around the sweat band, staring out 
over the back of the burro. “They 
done it green this time. They done 
it up bright green; you see that?” 
The boy nodded and spat — away 
from the immense green circle. He 
narrowed his eyes and looked out 
into the center, where the earth 
was freshly dug, piled a little high- 
er than the surrounding sand. 
“Somebody watching us. Pa? 
Somebody watching what we do 
from somewheres around here?” 

Pa shrugged, settling the hat 
back on his head. “Nah, I don’t 
think so. You can’t never tell, 
though.” He kicked at the edge of 
the green circle and the sand flew 
up, a blurred mixture of green and 
light brown. “We’re gonna have to 
do something about this here.” 



The boy still had his shovel tied 
to the side of his burro. He began 
to slip the knot around to where 
he could reach it. Pa coughed, gaz- 
ing at the small mound in the cen- 
ter of the green circle. 

“Hate like hell to dig her up 
twice in a row. Don’t seem right.” 

The boy buried the Made of the 
shovel in the sand and wrapped the 
rope into a coil around his arm, 
not looking up. 

“Your ma wouldn’t mind 
though, you understand?” 

The boy nodded, pulling the 
shovel out of the ground, swinging 
it onto his shoulder. When he 
looked up three small birds had 
settled on the mound in the center 
of the green circle. He wiped his 
forearm across his upper lip. 
“That’s funny. Pa, mighty funny, 
the way Ma useta — ” he searched 
for the word — “attract li’l birds, 
li’l animals.” He pointed with the 
blade of the shovel. “Look like 
she still do.” 

The older man stared at his son 
for a moment. “You getting to be 
a lot like your ma, you know? A 
lot.” He looked behind the boy, 
at the desert floor. 

On the short path his son had 
walked from the burro to the edge 
of the circle, tiny pebbles had 
quietly aligned themselves with the 
sides of his feet, pointing his direc- 
tion in two perfectly straight lines 
like marching soldiers. 

“C’mon Pa,” he said, glancing 
away. “We gotta dig.” •

THE WATCHERS 

JOSEPH DICKINSON 

I 

Have you ever had the feeling 
that somebody is watching 
you — and not giving a damn ^ 



117 




T he passing of Carl Bernardi 
stirred a great deal of conver- 
sation in the scientific community 
but little sympathy. That his death 
was an irreplaceable loss to science 
was too apparent to warrant argu- 
ment. His work in the field of pho- 
tics had opened whole new vistas 
for science. It was rumored that at 
the time of his death he was work- 
ing on a method of light propul- 
sion for spacecraft. Wilder rumors 
hinted that he had been aiming for 
a space speed only slightly lower 
than that of the propulsive force 
itself. 

These rumors were not true. 

Few tears were shed. Bernardi 
had been a solitary, distant man. 
The few papers he had presented 
had been delivered in a flat mono- 
tone, so low that the audience 
strained to hear and, resenting it, 
branded him an ineffectual speaker 
and contemptuous of his audience. 
When one of Bernardi’s few friends 
told him this he shrugged. 

“I am a scientist, not an enter- 
tainer. And I am contemptuous of 
fools. If they consider themselves 
in that category — ” 

He shrugged again. 

He worked alone, published his 
discoveries at his leisure, was never 
overanxious to share his finds. He 
was labeled as antisocial, cold, self- 
ish. 

I had known Carl Bernardi for 
over ten years. While I certainly 
did not claim a close or even 
friendly relationship with the man. 



he at least tolerated my presence. 
That word, too, lends to the un- 
truths they are spinning about him. 
His was not a grudging acceptance 
of existence — he simply noticed it 
when it was relevant. 

My relationship with Carl Ber- 
nardi was an extension of my fa- 
ther’s acquaintance with him dur- 
ing their college years. Acquain- 
tance is the only term one can use. 
Each knew the other’s face, though 
they often had to struggle for the 
'name that went with it. My father’s 
preoccupation with science was on- 
ly slightly less than Bernardi’s. 
How he emerged from it long 
enough to wed my mother and sire 
me is a scientific mystery in itself. 

So I was at least admitted to 
Bernardi’s home and laboratory. 
Actually, I believe anyone would 
have been, despite the rumors. If 
one could bear being unnoticed one 
could sit all day and watch Bernar- 
di work. 

I often watched him when I was 
young, fascinated by his absolute 
absorption as he deftly worked 
with impossible and sterilely beau- 
tiful apparatus or as he scribbled 
equations like long strings of San- 
skrit across his blackboard. I could 
not watch my father. Spectators 
bothered him. 

So I watched Bernardi, who nei- 
ther knew nor cared. I could even 
watch him think. I once saw him 
stare, motionless and rapt, at 
the old E=MC2 on his blackboard 
for over an hour. Watching, I fan- 



118 



IF 




cied the whirr of a computer tape 
behind his eyes. At last he rose, 
stepped briskly to the blackboard, 
drew a line under the formula, and 
placed a Figure one under the line. 
Bernardi then pocketed the chalk, 
left the room and had not returned 
when 1 left an hour later. 

During that hour I gazed in awe 
at the blackboard, wondering if I 
had just been witness to an altera- 
tion of one of the most sacred 
icons of science. A few years later 
1 asked Bernardi about it and what 
it had meant. He said he didn't 
know, could not remember the epi- 
sode and, in any event, it made no 
sense whatever. I did not trust his 
answer, will always wonder if that 
magnificent mind had mislaid the 
discovery of the century. 

W HEN I returned from two 
years in England, where I had 
tried and failed to write a novel, 
the first person I went to see — after 
my father, who had nodded and 
smiled as though I had gone to the 
corner for a newspaper — was Ber- 
nardi. After two years of failure 
the appeal of Bernardi, who could 
not fail — for*I believe even proving 
himself in error was a satisfaction 
to him — was obvious. 

His housekeeper admitted me to 
the old white rame building which 
was Bernardi’s home and labora- 
tory. She nodded without a smile, 
glanced at my shoes for mud and 
left me without a word (Dear 
friends and family, I thought, don’t 



make over me). I walked down the 
long narrow hall to the laboratory. 
Partitions had been removed and 
his lab occupied more than half of 
the lower floor of the building. 
Even remembering the clean clut- 
ter of apparatus which had always 
characterized Bernardi’s laborato- 
ry, I was unprepared for what I 
saw. An immense, gleaming steel 
turnip filled the room. It resem- 
bled, at least, a turnip, and must 
have been thirty feet long and twen- 
ty feet wide at the bulge. The tip 
tapered along a tube, also of some 
shining metal, and culminated in a 
heavy, safe-like box, the thickness 
of its walls apparent through a port 
glass which must have been easily 
four inches thick. At the end of the 
steel turnip, where the greens 
would have been, was a mask, like 
a welder’s mask and within it an 
eyepiece. 

Bernardi was not at the eye- 
piece. He was standing beside the 
grotesque machine, staring in 
through the port at — nothing. 
Nothing at all. The interior of the 
safe, well lighted, was empty. I 
watched him for some time. 

“Doctor?” I said finally and in 
a few minutes he turned to me. 

“Ah, yes,” he said and stepped 
forward to shake my hand. It was 
the first time he had ever touched 
me. I would have wrung out the 
moment embarrassingly but he de- 
tached almost immediately. “What 
is Mr. — ah — Dr. — ah — what is 
your father doing?” I thought it

admirable of him to even connect 
the two of us. Never mind that he 
couldn’t recall my name. 

‘‘1 don’t know,” I said. “When I 
left him he was putting a rabbit in- 
to a cellophane bag.” 

“Ah, yes,” said Bernardi as if 
that explained everything. He be- 
gan to shuffle past me toward the 
door and I thought that our reun- 
ion, beautiful as it had been, was at 
an end. Then he stopped and 
turned. “You write?” 

“Very little. An occasional 
Christmas card.” 

The bitterness was lost on him 
and I felt like a fool for it. 

“Is it important to you?” he 
asked. “To write?” 

I considered it. “It must be,” I 
said. “Something has to be. It’s 
all I know to do.’’ 

He nodded. “Yes. You are like 
me.” I was astounded. Then — sud- 
denly — 1 knew that it was true. 
“Come here,” he said, “and look. 
It may destroy you or liberate 
you. Perhaps both. They may be 
the same.” 

I walked cautiously to the steel 
turnip. 

“Look there.” He motioned me 
to the eyepiece. 

I bent to it. I blinked several 
times, adjusting my eye to the 
mechanism. A myriad of flashing, 
multicolored pinpoints of light, 
whirling and flashing, seemed to 
streak past me. Imagine a Fourth 
of July sparkler held inches from 
your eyes. That was how it was. 



“What is it?” 

“Let me increase the magnifica- 
tion.” 

The flashing streaks of light 
slowed and became stationary. 
Thousands of them. We moved in 
upon a loose grouping of them, 
perhaps twenty or more, at vary- 
ing distances from a central bril- 
liant point of light. It was much 
larger than the surrounding parti- 
cles. If they were pinpoints it was 
the size of a pea and glowing 
brightly. 

“What is it?” I repeated. 

“A molecule. Californium.” * 

“It — it looks like the solar sys- 
tem.” 

The magnification increased, fo- 
cusing on one of the pinpoints. The 
others were lost from the range of 
my vision as this one grew. It filled 
the circular scope of the lens, ob- 
late, vaguely white and shimmer- 
ing. 

“I don’t understand,” 1 said. 
“There seems to be — movement — 
as though the particle were made 
up of gases in violent motion.” 

“The — particle, as you put it — 
is solid enough. The movement is 
the motion of clouds.” I smiled at 
him uncertainly. I hadn’t realized 
that Bernardi possessed a sense of 
humor. “Clouds,” he continued, 
“drifting slowly through the at- 
mosphere of a planet a billion 
times smaller than a flyspeck.” 

“Slowly?” It was all I could 
bring myself to say. The man was 
not joking. 



120 



IF 




“Slowly to them.” 

“Them? My God, are you say- 
ing—” 

“Yes. Keep watching.” The 
image grew, became lost in the 
swirling whiteness. Then a faint 
tinge of rusty pink suffused the 
mist and it disappeared. “The in- 
frared,” murmured Bernardi. The 
white was replaced by blurred, 
streaking hues of browns and reds 
and greens and blues, forming a 
mass of twisted, sinuous color. I 
turned, baffled, to Bernardi. 

“The colors are from the move- 
ment of their worlds. The changing 
seasons, falling leaves, children at 
play — ” He sat heavily at one of 
the laboratory tables. 

“I still don’t understand. How 
can you tell? It was all a blur.” 

“Time is relative. One second to 
us is perhaps a thousand of their 
years. Since you turned from that 
microscope, a thousand genera- 
tions have perhaps come and gone. 
Legends have risen and died, civili- 
zations have been lost and redis- 
covered.” 

“Fantasy. You’re guessing. 
How can you tell?” I insisted. 

Bernardi rosp and crossed the 
room to a cabinet. 

“I photographed them,” he said. 

“Impossible.” Bernardi smiled 
slightly, withdrew a manila packet 
from the cabinet. “No camera or 
process exists which is sensitive or 
fast enough to stop action at such 
a speed.” 

“Tuttle’s camera is capable of 



one million frames per second,” 
said Bernardi. “Much too slow. 
However, using Tuttle’s camera as 
a starting point and applying cer- 
tain principles of the hologram — ” 
“The three-dimensional photo- 
graph?” 

“Yes. Rather than film, my de- 
vice uses a strip of plastic about a 
dozen microns thick. By refract- 
ing laser light, directing it against 
the length of the plastic, I was able 
to capture a good many more 
frames per second than Tuttle.” 
“How many more?” 

He shrugged. “Billions, per- 
haps.” 

I almost said impossible again, 
then realized that I was overusing 
the word. “I suppose that envelope 
contains a billion photographs.” 
Bernardi opened the envelope. 
“I’m afraid not. It is extremely 
difficult to process the exposed 
plastic, more difficult to separate 
the pictures — something like try- 
ing to dissect a spider web. Of the 
hundreds I have tried to process, I 
have succeeded in obtaining three.” 
The pictures were blurred and 
too bright, such as an inexperi- 
enced photographer might take, 
but the objects were clearly rec- 
ognizable. In one a child was play- 
ing with an animal, much like a 
dog, while in the background was 
the very shadowy figure of a wom- 
an, the child’s mother, perhaps, 
standing with elbows bent and 
hands on her hips. Another was a

street scene. Crowds of people, 
blurred to varying degrees, rushed 
in both directions before a building 
with a sign in lettering unknown to 
me. In the third the building was 
gone. The scene seemed to be a 
jungle. Dense growth, hanging 
vines, were thick about a small 
pool. At the edge of the pool, a 
pack of pig-shaped creatures, cov- 
ered with long, tangled hair, tore 
at an object on the ground. 

“How much time separates 
these?” I asked Bernardi. 

“Who knows? I could perhaps 
calculate the total number of 
frames on the plastic and arrive at 
a rough estimate of the time span 
the strip contains. But many of the 
pictures — most of the pictures are 
completely worthless, many are 
fused. It would be a lifetime’s 
work.” He shrugged. “It doesn’t 
matter, at any rate. However, 
those three were within a fraction 
of an inch of each other on the 
strip. And they were all taken at 
the same spot.” 

“It could be a thousand years.” 

“Or two,” said Bernardi. “Or 
three or four. As I say, it doesn’t 
matter.” 

“Doesn’t matter? This is the 
most amazing — these pictures — 
these people — ” 

“Those people have been dead 
a million years,” said Bernardi. 

“But the implications — ” 

B ernardi snorted, “implica- 
tions? Fact. The fact that there 



are a million living worlds within 
arm’s grasp of you, worlds that 
evolve and develop and live out 
their allotted millions of years in 
minutes or hours. Populated 
worlds. People like us, perhaps, 
trying^ to penetrate the secrets of 
their universe, their gods, but also 
people who laugh and sin and suf- 
fer. They bear children, worry 
about their youiig, lust and love 
and swindle and perform heroic 
acts. And die. Some of them, be- 
fore their worlds explode or col- 
lapse, may travel through their 
endless space to other planets and 
return to grand orations on how 
their race has begun to unlock the 
secrets of space. Then — one of our 
minutes later — their world is 
gone.” 

Bernardi paused to light his pipe. 
He held the match before him a 
moment before he blew it out. 
“How many worlds do you sup- 
pose I just destroyed by that 
flame?” I shuddered. He noticed 
and smiled. “That was my first re- 
action,” he said. “I found myself 
hesitating to light a match, to take 
a step, to bite into an apple. It 
soon passes. Gods like us cannot 
allow ourselves to care too much.” 

“Gods?” 

“Are we not? If they were aware 
of our existence don’t you believe 
that they would build temples to 
us, pray daily that we didn’t light 
that divine match?” 

I turned back to the microscope 
and put my eye to it, still too shak- 



122 



IF 




en to think or speak clearly. I 
found the image but the colors 
were gone. There was only blind- 
ing light. “Something’s wrong,’’ I 
said. 

Bernardi stepped beside me and 
bent to the eyepiece. “No.” He 
straightened. “That world is gone. 
Destroyed.” 

“But how?” 

“Who knows? Nova, perhaps. 
Perhaps I did it. The controlled 
conditions I use to allow observa- 
tion of such a world may upset its 
natural balance. 1 don’t know. It 
doesn’t matter.” 

“It must matter,” I said. 

“It doesn’t, believe me.” Ber- 
nardi replaced the photos in the 
envelope. He turned back to me. 
I had not noticed before how 
drawn and tired his face appeared. 
“I apologize to you,” he said. “I 
hope the apology is unnecessary — 
but in case it is not, I apologize.” 

“For what?” 

“I feel that you are a sensitive 
man. I am no judge of such things, 
since I have never been a sensitive 
person myself. I was too concerned 
about how little time I had for my 
work to concerft myself with sensi- 
tivity.” He took the envelope back 
to the cabinet. “I felt the begin- 
nings of sensitivity — much as you 
did — when I wrtched my first 
world disintegrate. But I have since 



found that this is not the thing that 
concerns me. If you should discov- 
er what does, just remember that 
I have apologized in advance.” He 
shut the door of the cabinet, stared 
at it for a moment, then walked by 
me without a glance and left the 
laboratory. 

Two days later he was dead. An 
explosion leveled his laboratory, 
destroying his notes, his apparatus, 
his pictures and himself. It was at 
first considered accidental but the 
autopsy showed that he had died of 
gas inhalation, and they found the 
note when they cleared the rubble. 
It was very terse, typical of him. 

“My death is my own doing,” it 
said, “and no one else’s. My will is 
attached.” 

He left everything to the church, 
which was not typical. 

But I think I have the answer to 
the question that was Carl Bernar- 
di. He could not reconcile himself 
to a life of seconds, no matter 
whose. And the bequest of the 
money — his little joke, perhaps 
his only joke. 

I began to realize these things 
after a few weeks of hesitating to 
light a match and take a step. Then 
I found the hesitation replaced by 
another nagging sensation, one 
which I — which all of us — have felt 
and dismissed lightly. I feel it now. 
The feeling of being watched. •

DENTAL assistant/hygienist/ 
LIGHT BOOKKEEPING QUALIRED 
EXPERIENCED UNATTACHED MUST 
TRAVEL. 

J UDY GALLAND read the 
strange ad again. It had not 
been placed by any agency she re- 
cognized and it gave no telephone 
number. Just an address in a blah 
neighborhood. It hardly looked 
promising — but she was desperate. 
She caught a bus. 

She concentrated on the ad as 
she rode, as though it had further 
secrets to yield. She was qualified: 
she was a capable dental assistant 
with three years experience in the 
office of a good dentist, and she 
was also a hygienist. She knew 
that few girls were both and many 
would not touch the clerical end of 
it at all. She was single and willing 
to travel across the world if need 
be. She was twenty-six years old 
and looked it. She got along well 
with people and seldom lost her 
temper. 

So why couldn’t she get a job? 
The bus jolted heavily over a set 
of tracks, shaking her loose from 
this pointless line of thinking. She 
knew what her problem was: she 
had worked for Dr. Dillingham, 
and Dr. Dillingham had disap- 
peared mysteriously. A construc- 
tion worker might fall off a beam 
and get killed and nobody blamed 
his co-workers. A big-game hunter 
might get eaten by the game, yet 
his bearers could find other em- 
ployment. A politician might get 



removed from office for malfea- 
sance, while his staff stepped into 
better positions. But let a small- 
town dentist vanish — 

She shook her head. She was 
thinking inaccurately. Much of her 
difficulty was her own fault: she 
had tried to tell the truth. Natural- 
ly no one had believed her story of 
weird aliens holding her captive 
while forcing Dr. Dillingham to 
work on their astonishing teeth. 
There had been no substantiating 
evidence except for the simple fact 
that he was gone without trace. 
Now the aura of that wild story 
hung about her, an albatross, kill- 
ing any chance she might have had 
to find other employment in the 
profession. In this corner of the 
world, at any rate. 

Had she claimed that a mobster 
had murdered the dentist and sunk 
him in concrete with shoes of wa- 
ter (or was it the other way 
around?) she might have been 
clear. But the truth had ruined her. 
Aliens from space? Lunacy! 

The bus halted near the address. 
She stepped down regretfully. This 
was an unfamiliar section of town, 
illkempt and menacing. Beer cans 
glittered amid the tall weeds of an 
empty lot. Down the littered street 
a drunk spotted her and ambled 
nearer. The bus blasted its noxious 
gases at her and shoved off. 

Only one structure approxi- 
mated the address: a cylindrical 
building several stories tall and 
pointed at the top. Its outer wall 



MONARCH 



125 




was shiny metal and surprisingly 
modernistic for such a region. Yet 
the lot had not even been cleared, 
except for the narrow boardwalk 
leading to the entrance. 

She started to turn back. Some- 
thing was unsubtly wrong about 
this ad and the address. What pos- 
sible use could they have for an ex- 
perienced dental assistant here? 

But the reality of her situation 
turned her about again. The bus 
was gone, the drunk was almost 
upon her, she had barely three dol- 
lars in her purse and her resources 
beyond that were scant. She had 
either to take what offered or 
throw away all her training and 
apply for unspecialized employ- 
ment. She pictured herself making 
beds, scrubbing floors, baby-sit- 
ting. Suddenly the nameless ad 
seemed more promising. 

She outwalked the drunk and 
knocked on the cylinderhouse 
door. This was a circular affair ar- 
ranged to resemble a ship’s port- 
hole. Modern architecture never 
ran out of innovations. After a few 
seconds it opened, the metal lift- 
ing up and out, drawbridge fash- 
ion. She took a nervous breath and 
entered a small, bare antechamber. 

“Name?” a voice said. 

For an instant she had fancied it 
was Dr. Dillingham speaking but 
it was some kind of recorded an- 
swering service whose intonation 
just happened to resemble that 
familiar voice. 

She answered the routine ques- 



tions automatically. That voice 
unnerved her and enhanced her de- 
pression. She had, of course, never 
let him know, but her initial re- 
spect for Dr. Dillingham’s tech- 
nical and ethical finesse had over 
the months and years deepened 
into a considerable appreciation of 
the man himself and even — 

She became aware that the ques- 
tions had ceased. An inner panel 
opened. “You have been accepted. 
Miss Galland of Earth,” the re- 
cording said. 

A figure stepped through the 
new doorway. 

Judy was not the screaming 
type. She screamed. 

UT I’m not a dentist,” Judy 
told the transcoder. “I’m a 
dental assistant and hygienist and 
light bookkeeper, as you must 
know.” The transcoder typed her 
words onto a stick in the form of 
indentations and the North Nebu- 
lite took this. He poked it into the 
orifice beneath his triple-slit nose 
and chewed gently. 

What Jaw motions constituted 
reading, as opposed to writing 
(typing?) she couldn’t tell, but in a 
moment he fed the talk-stick back 
into the machine. “You are Dr. 
Dillingham’s assistant. Extremely 
competent but aloof. We searched 
for you. We obtained you. This is 
his laboratory. So assist.” 

She peered at the alien para- 
phernalia. It had been a substantial 
education, finding out exactly 



126 



IF 




what had happened to Dillingham. 
Horrible as the purple-lipped, dou- 
ble-jointed North Nebulites — 
Enens, according to DHlingham’s 
invented information coded into 
the transcoder — appeared, they 
were pleasant enough when under- 
stood. The two designated to show 
her around were Holmes and Wat- 
son, though either answered (or 
failed to answer) to either name. “I 
never worked in the lab itself. Not 
that way. I can’t make a recon- 
struction. I’m not allowed to per- 
form dentistry on a patient — not 
by myself. I assist the dentist while 
he works. Where is Dr. Dilling- 
ham?” 

Holmes assimilated the new 
stick and bit off a reply . The Enens 
had been cagey about the late news 
on Dillingham, apart from vague 
assurances that he was doing well. 
She kept inserting the question in 
the hope that one of them would 
slip and give her an answer. This 
time it worked. “Dr. Dillingham? 
We sold him to the b’^h muck-a- 
muck of deep.” 

Judy started to laugh at the gro- 
tesque designation^Dillingham had 
hung on that entity. He must have 
enjoyed himself hugely as he pro- 
gramed the transcoder. On Earth 
he had always been serious. 

She sobered abruptly. “Sold 
him?” 

“He was on contract, same as 
you. Hostage against the expense 
of his procurement and shipment. 
Perfectly regular.” 



“I’m on — You advertised for 
an assistant not for a slave! You 
can’t buy and sell human beings.” 
“Why not?” 

She was not the spluttering type. 
She spluttered. “It just isn’t done 
— not on Earth.” 

Both Enens masticated that. 
“We aren’t on Earth,” Holmes 
pointed out. “Your ballbase play- 
ers are bought and sold on Earth,” 
Watson said. “Everything is in or- 
der according to Galactic codes.” 
“But Dr. Dillingham and I 
aren’t ballbase — baseball— players. 
And it isn’t the same. This is kid- 
naping.” 

The Enens nibbled sticks, not 
understanding what all the fuss was 
about. “Everything is in order. We 
told you that. Now will you as- 
sist?” 

Judy dropped that tack for the 
moment. The Enens had not mis- 
treated her, after all, and it was 
rather exciting being on another 
world — she could never have af- 
forded passage on her own. At 
least she was on Dillingham’s trail 
—that fact alone just about made 
up for the rest of it. She had not 
had any particularly inviting fu- 
ture on Earth. 

“Well, how about letting me 
talk to the muck-a-muck? I can’t 
accomplish much here by myself.” 
“But you applied for a position 
at Enen!” 

“I changed my mind.” 

It took her several more days to 
establish that her mind, once 



MONARCH 



127 




changed, was absolutely set. She 
did convince them that their own 
technicians were far more compe- 
tent in the laboratory than she, 
though far less competent than 
supposed at the time Dillingham 
had been sold. She suspected that 
Earth was about to sustain anoth- 
er dental raid — but finally she was 
on her way to deep. 



44DUT I’m not a dentist,” Judy 
-Otold the muck-a-muck. “I’m 
just looking for Dr. Dillingham, 
so I can — assist him.” 

“He departed last week,” the 
whale-like ruler of water-world 
deep communicated. This was the 
first time she had conversed with 
an entity while standing inside him 
— but such was Galactic existence. 
“Then I must follow him.” 

“Do you realize that we paid a 
hundred pounds of premium-grade 
frumpstiggle for your contract? 
You were billed as an associate of 
Dr. Dillingham, the famous exo- 
prosthodontist. Now the prince’s 
molars are beginning to itch again 
— and only a practitioner of Dill- 
ingham’s status can abate the con- 
dition.” 

“If Dr. Dillingham made the 
restorations those teeth should be 
giving no trouble,” she said loyal- 
ly. “Probably all your son needs 
now is some instruction in preven- 
tive maintenance. Teeth can’t be 
ignored, you know. You have to 
take proper care of them.” 



“That’s exactly what he said. 
You are his associate.” 

She sighed. “In that respect, 
yes. But as for — ” 

“Excellent. Provide the prince 
with expert instruction.” 

“First we have to come to an 
understanding,” she said. She was, 
by fits and starts, learning how to 
deal with Galactics. “If I instruct 
the prince you must agree to send 
me to the planet to which Dr. Dill- 
ingham went.” 

“Gladly. He traveled hence with 
a free-lance diplomat from Tra- 
chos. Their destination was — let 
me look it up in my tertiary mem- 
ory bank — Electrolus.” 

“Fine, I’ll go there.” Then she 
reconsidered. “I came to Enen too 
late and to Gleep ‘too late. How 
can I be sure he’ll still be at Elec- 
trolus, when — ” 

The communications tentacles 
of the huge Gleep-creature’s lung 
chamber waved and the transcoder 
dutifully rendered this visual sig- 
nal into English. “A perspicacious 
point. Suppose we send you to the 
diplomat’s following client? That’s 
— one moment, please — Ra. The 
radium exporter.” 

She was dubious. “Suppose Dr. 
Dillingham stays at Electrolus af- 
ter all?” 

“Then at least you’ll be in touch 
with Trach, the diplomat. He is an 
obliging fellow and he has his own 
ship.” 

She considered that, still not en- 
tirely satisfied. She had had exper- 



128 



IF 




ience with obliging fellows possess- 
ing their own transportation. Dill- 
ingham had been a pleasing con- 
trast. But, of course, this was not 
Earth and it did seem to be her 
best chance. 

“All right. Ra it is. Let’s see the 
prince now.” 



H er heart sank when she saw 
Ra. There was no green on the 
surface if the planet; the entire 
landscape seemed to consist of 
tailings from the mines, mounded 
into mountains and eroded into 
valleys. 

Radium mines — she had real- 
ized the significance of that too 
late. They were notorious through- 
out the galaxy for the effect their 
depths had on living creatures. The 
local ore, called pitchcar, was ex- 
traordinarily rich; thus it required 
only fifty tens of the stuff to pro- 
duce a full ounce of radium. The 
noncommercial byproducts such 
as uranium were discarded wher- 
ever convenient; there was no trash 
collection. 

The ship landed ungently. The 
front port burst open, admitting a 
foul cloud of native smog. Several 
troll-like tripeds stomped in. One 
spoke, his voice like dry bones 
being run through an unoiled 
grinder. 

“Slaves of Ra,” the central 
translator rasped, the words muf- 
fled by the babel of other rendi- 
tions for the benefit of a score of 



miserable species. “Cooperate, 
and you may survive for years. 
Malinger, and you will receive in- 
clement assignments. Any ques- 
tions?” 

Judy felt sorry for the prisoners 
but knew there was nothing at all 
she could do for them. 

“Sir,” a lovely ladybug called 
melodiously. “We are very hun- 

gry— 

True enough. There had been no 
food aboard and the trip had lasted 
sixteen hours. Many galactic spe- 
cies had much more active metab- 
olisms than human beings had and 
some were in a bad way. 

“The others will be hauled to 
the force-feeding station after pro- 
cessing. You will wait for the fol- 
lowing shift for sustenance, with 
half-rations for two days. Any 
other questions?” 

There were none. The hapless 
prisoners had gotten the message. 

“Now disembark promptly as I 
call your names. Aardvark.” 

A creature vaguely resembling 
its Earthly namesake emerged 
from its compartment and ambled 
forward. 

“Too slow,” the translator 
barked. A troll aimed a rod and a 
beam of energy stabbed out. A 
patch of fur on Aardvark’s rump 
burst into flame and the odor of 
scorched flesh drifted back. He 
broke into a gallop. 

Judy had not quite believed the 
pessimism of the prisoners as they 
traveled — she had talked with sev- 



AAONARCH 



129 




eral. She had been naive. This was 
horrible. 

“Bugbear.” 

A beetle the size of a bear lum- 
bered hastily out, as well it might: 
a touch of the laser would punc- 
ture its ifiin shell and send its 
juices spewing. 

“Cricketleg.” The next jumped 
down. Judy wondered how the roll- 
call came to be alphabetical in 
English, since the translator as- 
signed names purely by conven- 
ience of description. This was 
merely another mystery of galactic 
technology. 

“Dogface.” This one yelped as 
the beam singed his tail. 

“Earthgirl.” 

Judy sat frozen. It couldn’t be! 
She was only here to find Dilling- 
ham. 

A troll tramped down the aisle, 
poking his beamer ahead aggres- 
sively. He braced his three knobby 
legs, reached out with a hairy arm 
and grasped her hair in one hank. 
He yanked. 

“No!” she cried. “I’m only vis- 
iting! I’m not a prisoner — ” 

The troll hauled her up until she 
stood on tiptoes to ease the pain. 
“Visiting?” He aimed the beamer 
at her face. 

“Trach!” she screamed. “Trach 
of Trachos! I’m here to see — ” 

“A malingerer,” the troll said. 
“I shall make an example. First I 
shall vaporize her squat snout.” 
He flicked one of his four thumbs 
over a setting on the beamer and 



pressed the business end against 
her nose. 

“One moment, troll,” the trans- 
lator said. Such instruments were 
versatile, serving as telephones and 
radios as well as language trans- 
posers. “I believe I heard my 
name.” 

The triped hesitated, grimacing. 
“Who are you, butting into pri- 
vate business?” 

“Trach, naturally. Be so kind as 
to deliver that creature to me, un- 
damaged.” 

“I don’t know no Trach.” 

“Oh? Here is my identifica- 
tion.” A phonetic blob sounded. 

“Hm,” the troll said, disgrun- 
tled. “77ia/ Trach. Well, send her 
on to the branding station when 
you’re through with her.” 

Shoved out roughly, Judy tied 
up her hair temporarily and fol- 
lowed the translator’s instructions 
to reach Trach’s office. “Turn 
right, prisoner,” the unit outside 
the ship snapped. She turned right; 
the other miserable aliens turned 
left, headed for the dismal rigors 
of processing. 

She felt guilty. 

The spaceport, despite its chok- 
ing atmosphere, was enclosed. She 
could make out the blowing dust 
beyond the grimy window panels, 
showing that it was actually worse 
outside. She heard the shriek of 
ore-bearing vehicles and saw a line 
of bedraggled workers headed for 
the arid entrance to a mine. 

“Up the stairs, malingerer,” the 



130 



IF 




next unit said. She climbed flight 
after flight of cruelly steep rough 
stone steps. A panel on a landing 
gave her a view of a Ra graveyard: 
bones and clothing and shells and 
assorted other durable elements of 
assorted creatures. There was no 
attempt at burial. 

“Third chamber down, weak- 
Ung.“ She found the place and 
touched the door signal. 

“Enter,” a translator said from 
within. She was tempted to point 
out that it had forgotten the usual 
expletive. 

She edged the bleak metal door 
open. The chamber was empty. 
She heard water running and saw 
fog near the ceiling. Someone was 
having a shower. 

“I’ll be right out,” the pleasant- 
ly modulated voice said. It 
sounded real — as though spoken 
in English rather than translated. 
Unlikly, of course; she had en- 
countered no one from Earth since 
answering that fateful ad. 

The water noise stopped. Trach 
whistled cheerily- as he dried him- 
self in the other room. In a mo- 
ment she heard his feet on the 
floor as he dressed. He sounded 
heavy. “You’re Miss Galland of 
Earth,” he called. “The muck-a- 
muck of deep notified me.” 

“Yor'/e not using a transla- 
tor?” 

“I never bother,” he admitted, 
still out of sight. “Now where’s 
my jacket? Can’t entertain a lady 
undressed — ” 



“Dr. Dillingham — is he here?" 

“I’m afraid not. He left Electro- 
ns for the University. He’s under- 
taking administrative training now. 
I’m sorry to inform you that you 
made your trip here for nothing.” 
His solid footsteps approached. 

“Oh, no. I’m glad he’s not here. 
I mean — ” 

Then she saw Trach. A literal 
dinosaur. 

“My dear, you look good 
enough to eat,” he said smiling. 
He had two thousand teeth. 

She was not the fainting type. 
She fainted. 

4 41^0 W there is the problem of 

l^your contract,” Trach said, 
“deep transferred it to Ra, so — ” 

She was almost convinced that 
Trach was not the monster he ap- 
peared. He had not, after all, eaten 
her when he had the opportunity 
and certainly he was the essence of 
politeness. He claimed to be a veg- 
etarian reptile and if he were not 
fattening her up for a latter 
kill . 

“Does that mean it wasn’t a 
mistake? The trolls — my being on 
the—” 

“They don’t make mistakes of 
that nature,” he said reassuringly. 
“You are on their list.” 

“To die in the radium mines?” 
Maybe it would be preferable to 
be eaten by a dinosaur. “How 
could the muck-a-muck do such a 
terrible thing? I thought he was 
helping me.” 



MONARCH 



131 




“Merely good business practice. 
Nothing personal. He wouldn’t be 
muck-a-muck if he wasted Gleep’s 
credit status. Fifty pounds of 
frumpstiggle — ’’ 

“He told me a hundred.’’ she 
said indignantly. 

“That was to improve your self- 
image. It was his impression that 
you were overly dependent on Dr. 
Dillingham and lacked confidence 
in your own dental abilities.” 

“But I’m not a dentist! I can’t 
do prosthodontic — ” 

“Pretty sharp judge of charac- 
ter, that muck-a-muck. You do 
lack confidence.” 

“Oh, shut up!” 

“At any rate, he did help you. 
He notified me, knowing that I 
would arrange something. That’s 
my business, after all — arranging 
things for mutual profit and my 
own. Unfortunately — ” 

“You don’t have fifty pounds of 
frumpstiggle?” 

“As a matter of fact, I have 
considerably more, thanks to a 
generous settlement on Dr. Dill- 
ingham. But — ” 

“But—” 

“But the trolls of Ra are very 
fussy about allowing any entity to 
depart. Once there’s a contract — 
“They won’t let go,” she finished 
grimly. 

“Not readily. Others in the gal- 
axy have some very ugly suspic- 
ions about Ra. If too many pro- 
spective miners were to be re- 
leased those suspicions would be 



amply confirmed. Then it would 
be almost impossible for Ra to 
buy up contracts at any price 
whatever.” 

“So I have to take up pick and 
shovel?” 

“Oh, no. They are very efficient 
here. You would work in your 
speciality, caring for the miners’ 
teeth. Better dentures allow them 
to consume cruder staples and that 
is more economical, you see.” 

“I see. I don’t approve the mo- 
tive, though.” 

“Appreciation of Ra motives is 
an acquired taste. In certain re- 
spects, there is more need for med- 
ical and dental assistants here than 
for full MD’s or DDS’s, because 
only short-term measures are eco- 
nomical. The radiation, you know. 
And you would still be exposed to 
that.” 

She nodded. Had she really 
thought her prospects back on 
Earth were bad? 

“I have not relinquished the 
problem. Miss Galland. I merely 
wish you to comprehend its mag- 
nitude. Naturally we’ll find a way 
to remove you from Ra.” 

“I comprehend the magnitude. 
What do I have to do to escape?” 

“You have to obtain a sponsor 
who is able to influence the troll 
hierarchy. I can arrange tempor- 
ary reprieve but my influence is 
limited. I’m only a diplomat. If I 
push my luck — ” 

“The mines for you, too,” she 
said. “Will you teach the prisoners 



132 



IF 




diplomacy as they perish from ra- 
diation?” 

“I doubt if would come to that 
but there could be awkwardness. 
However, I’ll see what I can ar- 
range. I have had experience at a 
number of influential courts.” 

Judy smiled appreciatively but 
she had little hope. 



T RACH had been unduly mod- 
est about his resources. With- 
in six hours there was an urgent 
call from the Monarch of Lepidop: 
he wanted an experienced dental 
assistant and he wanted this partic- 
ular one. Since his subjects were 
resistive to radium poisoning, a 
task force of his navy traditionally 
transported Ra’s annual output of 
ten pounds pure to the galactic 
markets. 

He had, in short, influence. 

The troll hierarchy swallowed 
its gall and hastily made a gift of 
Judy’s contract to the Monarch, 
compliments of the honorable rep- 
utation of Ra. To make it quite 
clear where she had come from, 
they decided to brand her first. Of 
course, if she were willing to swear 
never to reveal what she had seen 
planetside even this small formal- 
ity might be dispensed with . 

Judy contemplated the sizzling 
branding iron, thought about the 
difficulty she would have sitting 
down thereafter and she saw her 
courage go up in steam. She 
agreed not to talk. 



The troll released her hair and 
she fell to the floor. 

Trach took her to Lepidop him- 
self. This was a favor she appreci- 
ated less than she might have, for 
his ship was a frightening rattle- 
trap. But she suspected that this 
was Trach’s way of saving his own 
reptilian hide, for the trolls of Ra 
surely were aware of his part in 
Lepidop’s demand and would not 
delay unduly in attempting to set- 
tle scores. 

Lepidop, in contrast to Ra, was 
truly beautiful. Iridescent films 
decorated its esthetic continents 
and rainbows were reflected from 
its shining oceans. 

The ship jolted to rest on a plat- 
form mounted on a spire about 
two miles above the surface. Judy 
was afraid the weight of the ship 
would collapse the insubstantial 
edifice but there was no sag or 
tremor. She disembarked. 

“Butterflies,” Judy exclaimed. 
“What marvelous wings!” 

“This is Lepidop,” Trach re- 
minded her gently. “Capital world 
of the declining Lepidopteran Em- 
pire. But you are right to compli- 
ment their wings; Leps are subject 
to flattery. Now the honor guard 
will insist on conveying you per- 
sonally to the Monarch and I 
don’t see how you can refuse.” 

“An honor guard? I’m the one 
who’s flattered. And I want to 
thank the Monarch effusively for 
saving me from Ra. Why should I 
refuse?” 



MONARCH

“Well, their mode of transpor- 
tation is not too every creature’s 
taste. 1 would prefer to walk, my- 
self. But since I am not permitt^ 
within the palace environs I shall 
merely relay my compliments and 
depart for my next mission.’’ 

“You’re going?’’ Her original 
distrust of him was as though it 
had never been; Trach was as nice 
a dinosaur as she had ever met. “I 
thought — ’’ 

“Some of the finer architectural 
structures are delicate and I’m 
rather solid,” he explained. An un- 
derstatement; she judged he weigh- 
ed several tons. “But the Mon- 
arch is basically a kindly fellow; 
don’t let his gruffness fool you. 
And beware of palace intrigues. 
I’m sure he’ll treat you well, pro- 
vided — ” 

“But how do I find Dr. Dilling- 
ham?” 

“I will notify the University. 
They’ll advise him in due course. 
You just stay put and wait for 
word. It may take a while.” 

She had other questions, sud- 
denly pressing now that Trach was 
about to leave her — but the man- 
sized butterflies were upon them, a 
fluttering phalanx. “Provided 
what?” she whispered. 

“Miss Earthbiped?” a translator 
inquired. She didn’t see the instru- 
ment, but hardly needed to. There 
was always a translator within ear- 
shot on civilized planets, except 
for places like deep, where such 
machinery was inconvenient, and 



Enen, where they couldn’t afford 
the expense. She automatically 
associated the translation with the 
speaker, as she had once associated 
subtitles with foreign speech in 
Earth movies. 

“This is Miss Galland of 
Earth,” Trach said formally. She 
had to pick up the introduction 
through the translator, for he was 
speaking directly in Lepidopteran. 
He was a phenominal linguist. 
“Summoned by the Monarch for 
dental assistancy and hygienicy.” 
And privately to her: “Provided he 
lives.” 

“This way, honored guest,” the 
lead butterfly said, spreading his 
huge yellow wings as he turned. 
Judy followed him to an ornate 
and fragile little cage, the other 
butterflies falling in around her 
and matching her step. “Enter the 
royal carriage.” 

She hesitated, the Ra experience 
fresh in her memory. This thing 
had neither wheels nor runners and 
white bars encircled it. It reminded 
her of a lobster trap. But Trach 
gave her a thumbs-up signal from 
the far side of the platform and she 
had to trust him again. She opened 
the latticed gate and climbed in. 
The fit was tight, vertically, and 
there was no proper seat; evidently 
this had been designed for a reclin- 
ing butterfly. A narrow section of 
the top was peaked: space for 
folded wings to project. 

The yellow butterfly closed the 
gate with one of his six small legs. 



134 



IF 




She arranged herself half-supine, 
propped against one elbow so she 
could wave to Trach. Then the 
others circled the cage, picked up 
threads hanging from its sides and 
beat their white wings in unison, 
while the yellow called the ca- 
dence. 

“Hup — two — three — four — ’’ 
Judy heard, not certain whether 
there was a translator, or at least 
a little transcoder, in the cage, or 
whether her own mind was doing 
it. “Hup— Hup— ’’ 

Suddenly they were aloft: but- 
terflies, cage and Judy — she cling- 
ing desperately to the bars. No 
wonder Trach had been nervous 
about the transportation. But it 
was too late to protest now. 

They flew over the edge of the 
platform and she closed her eyes 
against vertigo. Two miles in the 
air — with only butterfly wings and 
slender threads to support her! 
Did the Monarch often travel this 
way? Was that what Trach had 
meant by his hast^ warning: the 
Monarch would treat her well, 
provided he lived? Let one thread 
be snagged, one wing falter . 

But the cadence was steady and 
soon she was reassured that they 
were not about to drop her. She 
watched the aerial life of Lepidop: 
brown-winged butterflies, gray 
ones, green ones and blue, gliding 
their myriad ways. A number car- 
ried bags in two or three hands, as 
though they had been shopping. 
Others clustered and whirled in 



dazzlingly swift mid-air games. 

Yet Trach had said the Lepi- 
dopteran Empire was declining. 

T he palace was a tremendous 
silken nest, massed strands 
forming gleaming geometric pat- 
terns that glowed prismatically in 
the slanting sunlight. At every 
nexus a pastelle-winged butterfly 
perched, gently fanning the air. 

The cage came to rest in a 
cushiony chamber and the bearers 
let go the threads. Judy disem- 
barked cautiously and found the 
seemingly tenuous webbing quite 
strong. It gave a little under her 
feet, adding bounce to her step, 
and was in fact rather fun to walk 
on. Trach would have put a foot 
through, however. 

The yellow butterfly led the way 
to the throneroom. This was a 
splendid chamber whose lofty 
arches reached into a nebulous 
webflung dome and whose furni- 
ture was all of stressed silk. Upon 
the mighty yet delicate throne re- 
clined the ruler of the planet and 
empire. 

The Monarch was old. His tor- 
so was stiff and scaly, his antennae 
drooped and his wings were dead 
white cardboard. Had he been hu- 
man, she would have assessed his 
age at an infirm eighty. She knew 
immediately that he had no teeth. 

Why, then, had he wanted a den- 
tal assistant? Had his demand been 
made purely as a favor to Trach 
or was there more to it? 



MONARCH 



135 




“My dear, come here,” the 
Monarch whispered and the trans- 
lator conveyed jointly benign and 
imperative tonality. 

She stepped up to him, im- 
pressed by his bearing despite his 
antiquity. It was no longer a mys- 
tery why Trach had been con- 
cerned for the Monarch’s life. It 
was as though the very act of 
speaking might terminate his span. 

“You care for teeth?” 

“Yes, Your Majesty,” she re- 
plied, deciding not to quibble again 
over descriptions. She was no den- 
tist but she did take care of teeth. 

“You have experience with — ” 
here he paused to regain his shal- 
low breath — “Lepidop mandibu- 
lars?” 

“On my world, butterflies don’t 
have teeth.” 

“Interesting. On Lepidop (an- 
other breath) primates don’t have 
teeth.” He laughed — a painful rat- 
tle, even in translation. “But I 
suppose you (breath) don’t have 
genuine lepids, any (breath) more 
than we have real primates, 
(breath, breath) It is merely a 
convenience of expression.” 

Judy was happy to agree. This 
royal butterfly had no connection 
to any Earthly creature, just as 
Judy Galland had no connection 
to any galactic biped. The Mon- 
arch was not stupid but he was 
rapidly weakening from the effort 
of conversation. Gruffness was 
hardly the problem; a fatal over- 
sociability might be. 



“Dismissed,” the Monarch 
snapped. 

Two small purple Leps hurried 
her out of the chamber. 

“He’s obnoxious when balked,” 
one confided to her. 

“But he’ll die soon, fortunate- 
ly,” the other said. 

The words irritated her unrea- 
sonably. “Now, stop that. I think 
he’s very nice and I won’t have 
you saying such things behind his 
back.” 

The butterflies tittered and she 
realized that she had choSen a 
poor figure of speech. There was 
no “behind” for a butterfly’s back; 
there was only “above.” She had 
made a fool of herself to no pur- 
pose. Their remarks might even 
have been well intentioned — and 
were probably true. 

Well, Trach had told her to be- 
ware of palace intrigues. She had 
probably already put her foot in it 
by speaking out thoughtlessly. 

They showed her to a private 
chamber without further com- 
ment and left her. There was a 
galactic all-purpose unit that took 
care of all conceivable and some 
inconceivable physical needs and 
she had learned how to squeeze 
entertainment from a standard 
translator. 

“Sing me a ballad,” she direc- 
ted it. 

And it did. 

T he Monarch summoned her 
to another audience next day. 



136 



IF 




He was considerably more affable 
and she suspected that the court 
minions had dutifully relayed her 
remarks to him. She had spoken 
automatically but she had defend- 
ed the Monarch. Had she been 
negatively impressed she might 
have said something entirely dif- 
ferent, with no more thought. Lit- 
tle accidents like that could make 
all the difference, as she knew 
from her experience with patients 
on Earth. That was one reason 
dental assistants were usually per- 
sonable and cautious about giving 
opinions. Usually. 

Now she almost felt guilty for 
speaking out, as though she had 
deliberately played politics. May- 
be subconsciously she had. 

But still the Monarch had no 
teeth. She felt enxbarrassed, hold- 
ing her little case of instruments. 
What politics was he playing? 

“My dear, I like your (breath) 
spirit. Most visitors praise me 
lavishly (breath) to my antennae 
but sneer (breath) behind their 
wings. How would (breath) you 
like to visit my past?” 

“Your Majesty, I don’t under- 
stand.” 

“I am forty-two years old,” he 
said. The translator had rendered 
the time span into her terms, 
just as the all-purpose unit had 
created light and darkness to 
match her Earthly pattern of day 
and night. But it was a surprise. 
The Monarch was just about the 
same age as Dr. Dillingham. “We 



Lepids have lesser lifespans 
(breath) than some of you land- 
bound forms. But then we (breath) 
have greater abilities. So life is 
fair.” 

She had little basis to object, 
yet the Monarch’s abilities were 
obviously long past. “I don’t know 
how to — to visit your past. I’m 
sorry.” 

“Of course you don’t, my 
(breath) dear. I shall take you. 
Ten years; I (breath) have strength 
enough for that.” 

Whatever it was, if it required 
strength it was best discouraged. 
He could afford no superfluous 
expenditure of energy. “I don’t 
see what this has to do with dental 
hygiene. Your Majesty. Why take 
me?” 

“Give me your hand,” the Mon- 
arch said. “Oh, you have only 
(breath) two. Awkward, but I sup- 
pose you’re used to it.” 

“Yes.”<^ Hesitantly she held out 
one of her few hands, and he took 
it with one of his stick-thin mem- 
bers. His grasp was so feeble that 
she was afraid to close her fingers; 
even her lightest grip might crush 
his chitinous appendage. 

He shuddered. Something like a 
mild shock went up her arm. Then 
there was a strange shimmer. A 
wave of dizziness passed over her. 

“Ten years,” the Monarch said 
with pride. “My subjects can man- 
age no more than five even in their 
primes.” 

She disengaged her hand and 



MONARCH

looked at him, wondering whether 
he could be senile. A decade could 
not be wished away. 

His wings were orange. His 
body was full. His antennae were 
erect. He looked twenty years 
younger. 

Judy felt strange. Her clothing 
did not fit comfortably. Her 
blouse was loose, her skirt tight, 
her shoes wrong. She felt gangling 
and her face itched. What was 
wrong? 

“And now I have my teeth 
again,“ he said, smiling. And he 
did. “Of course they are not in 
good condition and in five more 
years I lost them entirely. But 
with your care and advice I may 
be able to preserve them longer.” 

This seemed to answer an im- 
portant question, but she hardly 
heard him. 

“I’m younger too,” she ex- 
claimed. 

“Naturally. So is the palace, 
the planet, the galaxy. This is my 
past.” 

“Time travel? That’s impossi- 
ble!” 

“Impossible for you, certainly. 
And for most species. That is why 
I was able to extend my empire so 
readily, though it is drifting away 
now that my powers have de- 
clined.” 

“But what about paradox? I 
mean — ” 

“There is no conflict. We are 
ten years younger, and the uni- 
verse is ten years younger, but 



we are not of it, precisely. The full 
explanation would be too techni- 
cal for your comprehension. We 
merely experience, we do not af- 
fect, except for our own bodies.” 

Judy shook her head. “How 
could you conquer an empire if 
you couldn’t use your talent to af- 
fect it?” 

“Simple. 1 travel to a foreign 
planet. Then I visit its past and 
make notes. Then I comprehend 
its vulnerability and in the present 
I exploit it. No enemy strategy is 
a surprise to me, nor can it ever 
be, unless it dates from beyoild my 
own lifetime.” 

“Your Majesty, it still doesn’t 
make sense. I see you younger 
and 1 seem to be about sixteen 
myself. But when I was really six- 
teen I was a high-school girl on 
Earth, ruining my teeth with cola. 
So this can’t be — ” 

“It is my past, my dear, not 
yours. You became younger 
merely to stay in phase with me. I 
would take you to Earth and show 
you that high school of yours — 
but my migrating years are over 
and no ship will respond to our 
touch now. You may look at Lep- 
idop instead.” 

“Don’t tell me you migrated 
between planets without ships!” 

"'Dont tell you? Very well, you 
shall remain ignorant of that 
talent.” The Monarch preceded 
her to a silken parapet walling off 
a bulging room, so that they ac- 
tually stood outside the body of 



138 



IF 




the castle. Beyond it the colorful 
butterflies danced in the early 
dusk, whirling in columns of tur- 
bulence. “See, the chrono gives 
the date,'* he said, gesturing to- 
ward a huge clock-tower about a 
mile distant. “Just over ten years 
ago. 

She saw the clock but did not 
know how to read its symbols. 
She was coming to believe that 
they had traveled back; nothing 
else explained the phenomena. She 
was younger; she could not be de- 
ceived about a thing like that. The 
Monarch now had plenty of breath 
and physical vigor — and he did 
have remarkable powers. 

A yellow messenger lighted on 
the parapet. Judy stepped back 
but the insect took no note of her 
or the Monarch. The yellow 
mouth parts were moving but she 
heard no translation. Naturally 
not, she realized when she consid- 
ered it: the machines could not 
have been programed for Eng- 
lish ten years before she came. 
The'' would be inoperative for her 
— and, of course, unnecessary for 
the natives. 

Then how, she wondered sharp- 
ly, was she able to hear and com- 
prehend the Monarch’s present 
speech? 

“My dear,’’ he remarked, “your 
thought processes are so delight- 
fully open. The phase applies to 
the translators too, but only for 
you and me; we can not commu- 
nicate with the creatures of this 



time, or indeed make ourselves 
known to them in any way. I heard 
no more than you did, just then.’’ 

“Oh,” she said, more perplexed 
than ever. 

A thick-bodied, furry-antennaed 
drab moth arrived on foot. It 
gazed out over the parapet a mo- 
ment as though envious of the 
aerial ceremonies beyond, then 
lowered its head to the wall. A 
tremendous tongue uncurled and 
brushed the tight strands that 
formed the parapet and all the 
castle/palace. She saw with shock 
that its wings had been partially 
clipped, so that it could not fly. 

“The menials come out at 
night,” the Monarch murmured 
distastefully. “We don’t associate 
with them, of course, but we re- 
cognize that they do have to clean 
the grounds sometime.” 

“The moths? They do the 
work?” 

“That is the natural order, since 
they are basically inferior. We 
merely relieve them of the onus of 
making decisions. No doubt they 
are happier than we are.” 

The moth hardly looked happy. 
It seemed resigned, feeling no 
frustration apart from that one 
glance outside, because it had no 
hope. Judy started to voice a pro- 
test at this callousness of the 
Monarch but he spoke first: 
“We’ll return to the throne room. 
You shall instruct me on caring 
for my teeth.” 

That was right — the Monarch 



MONARCH 



139 




had teeth now! This was one thing 
she was qualiHed to do. "'Suppose 
1 clean your teeth while I explain 
about the procedures?” 
“Excellent.” He settled on the 
throne and opened his mouth. 

H IS teeth were surprisingly 
similar to those of a human 
being: twenty-four of them, di- 
vided into incisors and molars, 
sixteen and eight respectively. No 
cuspids. Normal occlusion. That, 
as galactic dentition went, was 
practically identical to her own set. 

She brought out her instru- 
ments, set up the sterilizer and 
tied a protective cloth about his 
furry neck. This was awkward, be- 
cause his head was not attached 
in a familiar manner, but she had 
learned not to let such details in- 
terfere. She lifted a scaler and be- 
gan to check. 

“Your teeth are not in the best 
condition. I’m afraid,” she said. 
“There’s a good deal of erosion 
and the gums — ” 

“Ouch!” 

“Are a trifle tender. You need 
the attention of a dentist.” 

“Allow a moth to touch my 
royal teeth?” he demanded incred- 
ulously. 

“Don’t you have any butterfly 
dentists?” 

“Certainly not. No butterfly 
would soil his dignity by learning 
a trade.” 

“Trade? Dentistry is a profes- 
sion.” 



“Kingship is a profession, my 
dear. I would have any subject 
who fell so low as to practice a 
manual art put under the lights.” 
“The lights?” 

“Executed, to employ a euphe- 
mism. You would not care to 
know the details, my charming 
alien hygienist.” Then he fath- 
omed her thought. “No, there is 
no such restriction on aliens; we 
understand that the ways of the 
galaxy differ from ours peculiarly. 
No stigma attaches to you. You 
are not at fault for having been 
hatched on a barbarian world.” 
That did not allay her whole 
concern but she let it pass. Judy 
was beginning to appreciate the 
full extent of the problem. No 
wonder the Monarch had lost all 
his teeth. 

“Well, I can show you how to 
extend the life of your teeth but 
it’s already pretty late. Too much 
damage has already been done.” 
“Ten years is not far enough 
back?” 

“I’m sorry. Your Majesty, it 
isn’t.” 

“Explain anyway.” 

She continued to work, clean- 
ing away the immediate residues 
of what appeared to be years of 
neglect. “Oral prophylaxis is 
much more than just cleaning the 
teeth. The whole mouth, the en- 
tire habitat has to be considered. 
The food of primitive species 
tends to be hard, tough and gritty, 
and it cleans the teeth naturally. 



140 



IF 




But civilized foods tend to be soft 
and sticky and many essential 
nutrients are refined out. And sug- 
ar — well, it’s best to stay away 
from it, if you value your teeth.” 
“But I love sweet foods.” 

“Your teeth have already in- 
formed me of that. If you insist 
on eating sweets, at least keep 
your teeth clean at all times. A 
truly clean tooth cannot decay. 
And it is important to disturb the 
natural bacteria in your mouth 
regularly, for some of these at- 
tack the enamel of your teeth. 
You can’t eliminate all bacteria 
but you can rout them out and 
keep them uncomfortable, so that 
they never have a chance to multi- 
_ply and mass against your teeth.” 
“You are beginning to make 
sense,” the Monarch said. “But 
how do I keep them clean?” 

“You brush them, for one 
thing.” She brought out a tooth- 
brush, one of the few remaining 
from her original supply. “I’m 
sure you have better instruments 
and better systems at Lepidop, but 
the t^rinciple is constant: get them 
clean. Now I’ll demonstrate the 
best way to clean off the surfaces. 
Then you can do it yourself after 
every meal.” 

“But—” 

It was her turn to divine his 
thought. “This can’t be consid- 
ered manual labor. It’s hygiene. 
Only the most finicky and enlight- 
ened persons practice it. Clean 
teeth are a mark of, er, nobility.” 



“Naturally,” he replied, having 
known it all the time. 

“But brushing isn’t enough.” 
She brought out a spool of dental 
tape. “This is more difficult but 
more important. You have to pass 
the tape between your teeth, like 
this—” 

“Ouchl” 

“Now that didn’t hurt. Your 
Majesty. You just expected it to. 
You pass it between your teeth 
and pull it back and forth a little 
and it polishes the surfaces the 
brush can’t reach. Darn these in- 
experienced adolescent fingers of 
mine! There. And right there, in 
the crevices between the teeth, is 
where food is most likely to col- 
lect and where the undisturbed 
bacteria will feed and multiply in 
their own contented microcosm. 
You no more want to ignore these 
places than you want to ignore an 
assassin in your palace. Bacteria 
are assassins of your teeth.” 
“Suddenly I understand you 
very well. Give me that tape.” 

His digits were much stronger 
than they had been when he was 
old. Before long he became pro- 
ficient in both brushing and taping. 

“Now,” he said, “I begin to 
weary. Take my hand.” 

She took it, thinking he needed 
help, but as the vertigo passed 
over her she realized that they 
were jumping forward again in 
time. 

She was twenty-six again, her 
clothing fitting snugly, and he was 



MONARCH 



141 




back at forty-two/eight-odd. His 
wings were bleached, his antennae 
sagged. 

“But look,” he gasped before 
she left. “Teeth!” 

He was right. They were so de- 
lapidated as to be almost useless 
but they were there and they 
seemed clean. 

“You took care of them!” she 
cried, delighted. 

“For ten (breath) long years.” 
He flopped on the throne, ex- 
hausted. “Dismissed.” 

I T WAS several days before the 
Monarch summoned her again. 
“It is very tiring, revisiting the 
past,” he explained. “And tedious, 
following your instructions. But it 
saved my teeth for five years long- 
er than they lasted before. You 
gave good advice.” 

“I tried to,” she said but the 
whole business amazed her. How 
could they really have traveled 
back in time? But if they hadn’t, 
how had the Monarch recovered 
his teeth? They were not good 
teeth but they were genuine. 

“Ten years were not enough to 
grant me perfect dentures,’’ he 
said. “Would twenty years do it?” 
Twenty years were equivalent to 
forty in his life, she remembered. 
He would be half his present age 
— hardly past his prime. “It 
might.” 

“Take my hand.” 

She obeyed while protesting. 
“But Your Majesty. The strain — ” 



The dizziness overcame her. It 
was worse than before. 

When she regained equilibrium 
things had changed drastically. The 
Monarch was tremendous — twice 
his original size — and the throne 
had expanded to match. His wings 
were brilliant orange, delicately 
veined, bordered on the fringes 
with a double row of white spots 
set in black. His torso was full and 
strong. His antennae were long and 
firm. He was a splendid insect. 

And his teeth, as he smiled, were 
fine and even. He had done it: he 
had taken them back to the time 
before dietary dissipation and den- 
tal neglect had damaged his teeth 
irreparably. 

But Judy was in trouble. She 
looked at herself. Her clothing 
hung upon her in gross festoons, 
her shoes were like boxes and her 
dental case was impossibly heavy. 

She had lost two decades. Physi- 
cally, she was six years old. 

“Come fly with me, my dear,” 
the Monarch said. “This is my 
time of power.” 

“But I’m not dressed — ” 
“Neither am I. Does it matter?” 
What use to debate with a but- 
terfly about clothing? Her blouse 
was now as big on her as a dress 
and far less neatly shaped. She 
belted it around her middle with a 
strand of dental tape and discarded 
much of the rest of her apparel. 

They went to the parapet, its 
outer bulge now swollen into a 



142 



IF 




large balcony. “But you said 
equipment wouldn’t work for you 
here,” she protested, remembering 
what he had said ten years later 
(three or four days ago, subjective 
time). “How can you fly?” 

“You jest, my dear,” he said be- 
nignly and hooked four hands into 
the back of her blouse-dress. She 
screeched as the dental tape 
snapped and she h&d to scramble 
to avoid complete dishabille. 

The Monarch flexed his hand- 
some wings. Air blasted down and 
then they were aloft. By the time 
she had managed to knot her out- 
fit securely about her the palace 
had fallen away and the ground 
was already awesomely far below. 

Now she was glad she weighed 
so little. Her blouse was good ny- 
lon, but . 

“Material power,” the Monarch 
said as they flew. “It has been 
claimed by sages on my world and 
perhaps even on yours that this 
can not bring happiness but as- 
suredly it can. At this moment in 
the span of my reign I control sev- 
enty systems, each with one or 
more habitable planets, and I hold 
a virtual monopoly on the distri- 
bution of Ra radium throughout 
the galaxy. I have phenomenal 
wealth and even the lowliest of my 
subjects live in ease. Look there!” 

She peered as he swooped low. 
She saw a silver city with minarets 
and flying buttresses, each struc- 
ture bedecked with scores of bright 
green butterflies. It was as beauti- 



ful a municipality as she had ever 
seen. 

“Is this your capital?’’ she 
asked. 

He laughed resoundingly. “This 
is Luna — the slum-city of Lepi- 
dop. Every occupant is a moth. 
See the ugly spots on those 
wings.” 

The spots were not ugly to her. 
“Luna moths,” she murmured. 

“And look there.” 

It was a forest, but like none she 
had known on Earth. Each huge 
tree was barrel-shaped, its foliage 
on the outside, its fruit hanging in- 
side. She learned that when the 
fruit became ripe it dropped so 
that more could be grown on the 
same stem. There was preservative 
gas within the hollow center, so 
that the tree gradually filled with 
its own fresh fruit, a natural store- 
house. Enough was stockpiled in 
this one forest to feed several cit- 
ies for months. 

“And there.” 

Now they came upon an ocean 
of water-color-paint water. Gey- 
sers plumed from its sparkling 
depths into the sky, forming am- 
bient vapor-scapes of every lovely 
hue. Swallow-tails spun within 
these falling mists, spraying rain- 
bows from their wings. 

“This is my empire,” the Mon- 
arch said. “This is power, this is 
beauty, this is joy.” And Judy had 
to agree. 

They returned to the palace. 
“Why don’t you build a dental 



MONARCH

clinic in this time/' she inquired, 
“so that no citizen needs to have 
lived without proper care? The best 
food is wasted if your teeth are 
poor and no one can be happy 
when he has a toothache.” 

“What I do now can affect only 
myself,” he reminded her. “And 
you, to a lesser extent. But in our 
normal time I shall build a clinic 
for the future.” 

She checked his teeth. “There is 
some damage, but Fm sure that 
proper care will preserve these for 
the rest of your life,” she said. 
“Brush them after every meal and 
brush the rest of your mouth, too, 
to disturb the bacteria. Use the 
dental tape. Don’t eat any more 
processed carbohydrates than you 
really have to. And have your 
mouth checked every six months.” 

“But who will do the checking?” 

That moth problem again. And 
of course the Monarch could not 
summon any offworld dentist to 
work on his teeth in this flashback 
status. “I suppose you’ll just have 
to do the best you can by yourself. 
That isn’t ideal but it will certainly 
help.” 

Then she cleaned his teeth care- 
fully, though her tiny six-year-old 
hands were clumsy at so special- 
ized a task. She reviewed him on 
the techniques of dental prophylax- 
is until she was satisfied that he 
knew exactly what to do. 

Finally they returned to the 
present. There was some awkward- 
ness about her tangled clothing 



that amused the Monarch, but he 
was too fatigued to laugh long. He 
collapsed almost immediately, 
frightening her. Twenty years 
seemed to have been a terriffic 
strain on his system. 

The Monarch was old again but 
he did seem to be in better health 
than before, as though his new at- 
tention to diet had helped more 
than his teeth. And his teeth y^ere 
improved; he was still able to chew 
most foods without discomfort. 

If human beings had the ability 
to impart their knowledge to their 
younger selves, as the Monarch 
had done, they might all have su- 
perior teeth, she thought wistfully. 



M onths passed. Judy was 
well treated at the palace, and 
from time to time (figuratively) 
the Monarch summoned her for 
conversation. He was inordinately 
proud of his preserved teeth and 
gave her full credit for the advice 
that had in effect restored them. 
But her service to him had ended; 
she could leave Lepidop at any 
time she found somewhere better 
to go. 

Yet there was a certain lingering 
dissatisfaction. Mis teeth were not 
perfect, and she knew that he con- 
cealed occasional pains, not want- 
ing to admit this flaw in the gift. It 
would have been so much better 
for him to have had the regular su- 
pervision of a dentist (even a moth 
dentist!), for the patient simply

could not do everything for him- 
self. 

She was increasingly nervous, 
too, because she had not heard 
from the University. Trach was 
long gone and she had no idea of 
how to reach him. She might have 
placed an interplanetary call, but 
this wasisxpensive and she did not 
have a planet to name. He could 
be anywhere in the galaxy. 

the dinosaur notified those 
authorities of her whereabouts? 
Had they in turn notified Dr. Dill- 
ingham? Had he been interested 
enough to put in a requisition for 
her, or whatever it was at this lev- 
el? 

She had supposed that Dr. Dill- 
ingham had been satisfied with her 
performance and might like to 
have her as his assistant again. But 
as a University administrator he 
would rate the best and she could 
not delude herself about her status 
there. She was used to his manner- 
isms and individual techniques and 
that was all. 

She made use of the comprehen- 
sive Lepidop library of dental in- 
formation, studying the configura- 
tions of the dentures of a thousand 
alien species. She visited the lowly 
moth dentists and found them a 
good deal more knowledgeable 
than the opinion of the butterflies 
suggested. She asked the translator 
about the University — its proce- 
dures and hierarchy. She waited. 

Nothing. Either the message had 
not gotten through, or Dillingham 



was not interested. She was help- 
less. 

''I have had a taste of better 
health,” the Monarch said, shaking 
his faintly orange wings. ”It incites 
me to desire more. If twenty years 
did this, what might thirty do?” 

That would be equivalent to six- 
ty, by her scale. He would be in ef- 
fect twenty — at the very prime of 
life. Of course, nothing short of a 
complete overhaul from the mo- 
ment of conception on would pro- 
vide him with absolutely perfect 
teeth but — 

“If I begin caring for my teeth 
in the flush of my youth, at the 
time I first emerged from the 
chrysalis, they will remain strong 
forever!” he cried. 

She kept forgetting that the but- 
terfly life-cycle differed from her 
own. Perhaps that was time 
enough. 

“Come, my dear — take my 
hand.” 

She tried to stop herself but his 
word compelled her just as though 
she were a butterfly subject. 
“Wait!” she cried, suddenly realiz- 
ing what thirty years would mean 
to her. “I can’t go back to — ” 

And the vertigo overcame her. 

It was much worse than before. 
She felt as though she were being 
turned inside out through the 
mouth and dipped in lye. She felt, 
she fought, she expired, she 
emerged into . 

Nightmare. 

The choking, crying, bleeding 



MONARCH

miasma of extinction. Her arms 
were bound in mummy wrappings, 
her eyeballs were rotten. She 
screamed with the soundlessness of 
an anguished ghost. Maggots were 
feeding on her tongue, flames on 
her wings. 

She had tried to go back to four 
years before she had been born. 



B ut it was not her own demise 
she experienced. The Monarch 
was dead. His ancient husk of a 
body dangled from her hand when 
she stood and, when she tried to let 
go, his desiccated hand fell apart. 

“Murderous alien!” the court 
butterflies cried, discovering her in 
her guilt. “You made the Mon- 
arch attempt the impossible. You 
crucified him on your short life- 
span and now the Empire will 
fall!” 

Judy found no way to protest. 
She had led him on to it, however 
unwittingly. 

“You shall die the death of a 
thousand lights,” they screamed. 
“Moths shall spit on your re- 
mains!” 

They put her with all her pos- 
sessions in a cocoon tower near 
the apex of the castle. She could 
see beyond the strands to overlook 
the lovely countryside, but she 
could not break them or force 
them apart in order to escape. 
They were like invisibly barbed 
wire. In any event, it was a long, 
long fall to the moat and sharklike 



beetle larvae cruised that dreary 
channel. 

Butterflies swooped from the 
sky, their wings translucent in the 
sun. Each carried a beamer 
pointed toward Judy’s prison. 
Some of these rods were silver, 
some black, some green — all the 
hues of Lepidop. The insects 
zoomed at her in single file and 
from each weapon a narrow light 
speared into her cage. 

At first she flung herself aside, 
trying to avoid the profusion of 
beams, but she could not escape 
them all. Then she discovered that 
they did not hurt her. They were 
merely lights that illuminated her 
prison momentarily and faded 
harmlessly. 

Pain blossomed in her leg. One 
of those lights was a laser! 

An hour and several scorches 
later she figured it out. At irregu- 
lar intervals a butterfly would ap- 
proach carrying an orange rod — 
the color matching the wings of the 
dead Monarch. This was the laser 
— the beam she had to avoid. 

But it was nervous work. She 
had to watch every butterfly and 
there were always several in sight. 
The beamers were not easy to see 
until almost within effective range, 
so she had only a moment to spot 
the orange one and dodge its pen- 
cil-thin sword of heat. The bars 
of the cage inhibited her view also 
at critical moments. The beams 
were somehow set to have effect 
only in her vicinity; they passed 



146 



IF 




through the cage strands harmless- 
ly, and dissipated beyond the co- 
coon. She was the only target; 
when her attention lapsed, she got 
stung. 

So far the wounds had been 
painful but not critical. Eventually 
a laser would strike an eye or 
some other vital spot, she knew. 

The death of a thousand lights. 
She understood it now. A hundred 
thousand threats, one thousand ac- 
tual attacks. One or two strikes 
she could forget; ten or twenty she 
could suffer through; one or two 
hundred she could survive with 
proper medical attention. But a 
thousand would surely finish her. 
Those she managed to avoid still 
took their toll, for she could not 
relax at any time while watching 
for them and sleep would be im- 
possible. 

Sometimes one laser followed 
another consecutively. Sometimes 
half an hour passed l^tween shots, 
though the innocent-light butter- 
flies swooped past steadily at inter- 
vals of five to ten seconds. The av- 
erage laser came around fifteen 
minutes. That would be four an 
hour, she calculated feverishly, or 
almost a hundred in a twenty-four 
hour span. 

It would take ten days for the 



torture to expend itself. Far longer 
than she could remain alert. Even- 
tually she* would sink into uncon- 
sciousness, from fatigue if not 
from wounds. 

The death of a thousand lights. 

Her eyes ached. The constantly 
oncoming butterflies blurred. They 
no longer seemed beautiful; they 
were wings of horror. Always one 
passing; close, its light aiming, 
stabbing. Always one a few sec- 
onds behind, its beamer lost in the 
distance. And others, trailing back 
into the sky — an ominous parade 
of beating wings. 

She cried out. She had nodded 
off without realizing it, hypnotized 
by the steadily cruising, flexing 
wings. A laser had scored, singeing 
a strand of her hair and scorching 
one shoulder. It was as though ^a 
white-hot poker had been jammed 
against her, destroying flesh and 
bone to a depth of a quarter inch 
and cauterizing its own wound. 

Night came but no relief. Now 
the moths were marshaled to the 
task, their rods softly glowing in 
the same array of colors. This was 
no favor to her, she knew. She had 
to be given a chance to spot the 
orange ones. Otherwise her vigil 
would be useless, and she simply 
would have to lie down and let the

beams come. That would remove 
half the torture and shorten its 
duration. 

She nodded off again and was 
struck again — but this time she 
had been fortunate enough to pick 
up almost thirty minutes of sleep. 
That enabled her to remain alert 
for several more hours. 

Then the blurring resumed and 
she had a tightening headache and 
knew that the dismal end was com- 
ing. She would fight it but her 
point of no hope was incipient. All 
she had wanted to do was to rejoin 
Dr. Dillingham; the cruelest part 
of it all was his failure to respond. 
He would have responded, she was 
sure now, had he been told. Maybe 
the University had buried her mes- 
sage as crackpot. 

She chided herself for feeling 
sorry for herself, then reacted an- 
grily: now was the best of all times 
to feel sorry for herself! 

A larger light showed in the dis- 
tance. She thought it was the rising 
Lepidop sun but it seemed to be 
star-shaped. And not natural. 
Soon she unblurred enough to 
make out the glint of metal. A 
machine of some sort. 

Erom it a searchlight-sized beam 
emerged, sweeping across the plan- 
et. Was this the final laser? 

She screamed involuntarily as 
the huge light found her and 
bathed her blindingly but she did 
not burn. The machine came down 
its headlight as though it were an 
Earthly locomotive. She could 



make out no detail of its shape. 

Her cage exploded. She felt her- 
self falling, still blinded. She heard 
the chitter of untranslated moth 
protests. Something hard caught 
her arm and hauled her up rough- 

ly- 

“None but I shall do him die!” 
a metal voice boomed. Now she 
knew she was hallucinating, for 
translators could not fly. “And 
you will join him there.” 

“I know that!” she snapped hys- 
terically. “At least give me some 
butter for these little burns — ” 

And that was strange, for she 
was not the hysterical type. She 
wondered when the end would 
come. •

A HELPING HAND 



Like men, Jeeiiens hurt e 
Httie eiithe time — but 
they bed found e wey out! 





T he roof fell in as Tryss and I 
came back with the latest flora 
samples. I imagine it looked pretty 
ridiculous — from a safe distance. 
Just as we went past the posts they 
both splayed out as if they’d been 
cued and the flimsy overheads 
started showering broken adobe 
and wooden shingles on us. 

(Actually, it was the porch roof 
that fell in. I should specific. 
Shan is always telling me: Say 
what you mean.) 

Tryss, at least, thought it was 
funny. We weren’t hurt and he sat 
there in the wreckage — dust bil- 
lowing up around him and giving 
him the look of a bald fox-faced 
monkey being cooked alive — 
squealing in what passes for laugh- 
ter among the Jeeli. After I ascer- 
tained none of the sample pack- 
ages had burst when we’d dropped 
them I even joined in with a bit of 
weakly nervous chuckling of my 
own. After thirty-seven days on 
the planet and nothing to show for 
it the whole lab might as well cave 
in, not just the porch. 

Shan came out to see what the 
noise was about. “You hurt?” he 
asked, holding out a hand. When I 
shook my head he put his hand 
back onto his hip. 

Still squealing, Tryss was on his 
feet now, bending over to pick up 
the scattered samples. We all 
pawed through the rubble, sorted 
out the packages and lugged them 
to the lab, trailing chunks of bro- 
ken adobe, occasional splinters and 



Brownian tail of fine dust. Messy. 

“Josy, can’t you do anything 
without creating an uproar?” 
Carteret complained. I was 
tempted to be scathing but thought 
better of it. In another year 
Carteret was going to be a lot 
more than Shan’s cochief and it 
wouldn’t do to irritate a future su- 
perior. Then, too, I suspected he 
was on the cleanup squad that day 
and was taking the mess of mud 
and splinters personally. 

“Just consider it the noise asso- 
ciated with inspired research.” 
Shan elbowed some notes out of 
the way and he, Tryss and I eased 
our armloads of samples onto the 
countertop. “It was just the porch 
collapsing, anyway. The Jeeli never 
build anything to last.” 

“Good thing we built the lab,” 
Shan remarked. He was using part 
of that vastly compartmented 
brain of his to pass the samples 
out for testing. The recipients 
wandered off reading labels and 
bumping into tables absent- 
mindedly. The room was suddenly 
full of the silent sound of mental 
gears meshing. I felt conspicuous- 
ly unemployed since I’d finished 
my perception test run two days 
ago. 

“Incidentally,” Shan said,* 
“D’Vrainy call^ while you and 
Tryss were gone.” 

“Uh-oh?” Tryss said, waggling 
his pale red eyebrows. The first 
Federation Basic that e.t. kids pick 
up are those little nonsense-sylla-

IF 




bles-pregnant-with-meaning our 
language abounds in. They do all 
the proper eye-bugging, mouth- 
pursing, tongue-clicking or what- 
ever else is necessary dramatically 
to underline each phrase and they 
seem to know what each means, 
too. That’s what makes it so easy 
to teach them modern ways, even 
when the adult populations are 
resistant. 

“Uh-oh, is right,” Shan agreed 
with a sigh. “He should be here 
any minute.” 

“Does he believe leaning over 
our shoulders is going to produce 
results any faster?” 

“That’s your department, psy- 
chologist.” Shan was studying the 
contents of one of the few remain- 
ing sample packages. “They get 
this out of a local cannabis field? 
Wow!” 

“It’s labeled.” I checked the 
comp tape the crew had run while 
Tryss and I had been collecting 
samples from the skimmer pilot. 
With my psych work temporarily 
stalled I figured I’d better shift to 
my second suit: pattern spotting. 
Out of the corner of my eye I saw 
Carteret stare at me a minute, 
then turn away. Efficiency check? 
Division loved his reports and his 
drive to succeed. They always 
liked success and the pressure was 
definitely on here; we all felt it, 
especially D’Vrainy and his men. 
They had been most cooperative 
in collecting weird flora, fauna and 
mineral samples from all over the 



planet. They had curtailed their 
work at the processor and run odd- 
ball errands for us so we could 
plow all our time into research. It 
was embarrassing. The base — it 
hardly deserved the title “Colony” 
yet — was so new the serial tags 
hadn’t peeled off the equipment. 
And here they were out snatching 
ecological snippets for our team. 
But we hadn’t given them a prize 
so far and the latest tape was no 
exception. If we could only get the 
Jeeli on their feet, get them oper- 
ating at any kind of normal lev- 
el .. 

“There is a deadline, you 
know,” Carteret was telling some 
of his techs acidly. 

F rom outside came a wiffling 
sound that signaled the immi- 
nent landing of a skimmer. No 
need to ask whose, after Shan’s 
remark. I found myself clutching 
the comp tape and trying to look 
earnest and busy. 

The noise of the skimmer dulled 
and a number of voices became 
louder and louder as their owners 
walked toward the lab. Somebody 
kicked some boards in the ruins of 
the porch and somebody else re- 
marked on the scene with inspired 
profanity. Then: “Just get over 
there and tell him I want thirty kil- 
os extracted by tomorrow. And I 
am not interested in excuses.” 
There was a trompling of fading 
footsteps as people apparently 
hurried to obey that familiar voice. 



A HELPING HAND 



151 




Then the colony director stepped 
inside the lab, looking satisfied but 
not pleased. 

“I’m not interested in excuses 
from you, either. And what the 
hell happened out front?” 

“We didn’t intend to give any 
and the porch caved in,” Shan said 
mildly. “I presume the Jeeli will 
put up another one of these days, 
with the kids’ obsession about put- 
ting porches on everything.” 

“Admittedly, it’s one of their 
few self-initiated projects.” 
D’Vrainy had his hands behind him 
under his favorite feathered cloak. 
Thrown over someone his size, it 
produced the effect of an immense 
brooding predatory bird and when 
he walked toward you with that 
curiously light step of his you 
hoped he wasn’t hungry. On any- 
one else such a cloak combing 
with fatigues would have been lu- 
dicrous. On him it wasn’t. 

“Just what are you giving me?” 

“We’re working,” Shan said. 
I’d watched him move around 
directors before but this time I 
sensed he was nervous. And all the 
staff seemed to be trying to outdo 
one another in creating an aura of 
purposeful effort. I felt naked 
standing there. 

“A lot of taped analyses I 
haven’t the time or training to di- 
gest and a great many due bills 
for esoteric equipment,” D’Vrainy 
grumbled. His voice took on a 
pleading quality. “Haven’t you 
anything to show?” 



“Not yet — but soon,” Carteret 
promised and Shan glared at him. 
“It takes time for us to go through 
all the possibilities.” 

“Sometimes months,” I said 
and, under D’Vrainy’s stare, added 
with forced optimism; “or maybe 
we’ll stumble on it tomorrow.” 

“Stumble. Oh, I know — Psy- 
chologist Josepha Wales and her 
widely vaunted intuitive insight. 
Well, read cards or crystal-ball 
gaze but find us answers.” 

Shan threw me a shut up look. 
“Believe me, sir, it does take time. 
We are anxious to help the Jeeli, 
too. Just as eager as you are for 
solutions.” 

“Are you? I’m where the buck 
stops. You said maybe r^onths. 
We haven’t got maybe months. 
Thirty days, outside. We’ve got to 
bring these people forward — and 
now. That would certainly be bet- 
ter than relocating the population, 
I hope we agree?” D’Vrainy 
paused and looked down at Tryss 
and suddenly smiled. He began to 
chat in Jeeli with the boy and it 
was plain his friendliness was genu- 
ine. Tryss grinned back and glowed 
at this attention. 

“We’re examining some new 
flora samples now,” Shan mut- 
tered, half to himself. We were 
both afraid of and admiring of 
D’Vrainy. We knew the Division’s 
deadline on the Jeeli problem and 
understood that he had to lean on 
us. Yet the situation on this planet 
was enough to make anyone with 



152 



IF 




even an ounce of pity tear hair. 

""Ey-dya, Tryss.” We glanced 
toward the lab door. Berayn 
hulked there, looking at us with 
half-closed eyes. 

“Fa/Wfl,” Tryss responded, wav- 
ing a hand in a go-away gesture. 

D’Vrainy studied the Jeelian ad- 
olescent framed by the door. 
“Some relation to this mascot of 
yours?” 

“Brother,” Shan said. 

It was difficult to believe. Tryss 
was a near equivalent of a bright 
Terran eleven-year-old, from a 
limited intellectual background, 
true, but eager and willing to learn 
and eminently teachable. He’d 
make a great little lab tech, for ex- 
ample. Berayn, a scant three years 
older, was a caricature from 
Earth’s rustic past: dull expression, 
mouth always slightly open, sleepy 
eyes, slouching posture, slothful 
movements and an intelligence re- 
sponse-level definitely subnormal. 
I’d run those tests myself. 

D’Vrainy pouted and his hands 
behind his back flipped rapidly at 
the feathered cloak. The action 
made him look tailed and didn’t 
improve his baleful image. “What 
the hell happens to them?” and 
there was frustration and anguish 
in his voice. 

“Given time,” Shan offered, 
“we hope we can find out.” 

“You know the deadline. Surely 
in that time we can help the Jeeli 
up to where they can start being 
self-sufficient?” I had a moment’s 



irrational idea that in their own 
dull, contented way perhaps the 
Jeeli y^ere self-sufficient; but at 
the time I knew they were not and 
kept quiet. D’Vrainy went on, 
“There’s a whole big rich planet 
out there, just waiting for them to 
develop it. And we can show them 
how, if they’ll just learn. Tools, 
the works. The Division is willing 
to shovel millions in here and boot- 
strap them up. They can be full- 
fledged partners with us.” 

Shan hunched himself against 
the counter. I knew that look; hav- 
ing been reminded so forcefully 
once more of the depressing nature 
of the Jeeli problem he was trying 
hard to keep scientifically aloof 
and not succeeding. “All speed, sir 
— you know that.” 

D’Vrainy’s shoulders slumped. 
“Just keep at it. Anything you 
need. Anything at all.” Then he 
straightened and moved lightly to- 
ward the door. Berayn, after a 
moment’s intense study of the size 
of their two bodies and the shape 
of the door, edged out of the way 
so D’Vrainy could pass. The direc- 
tor paused and looked down at 
the boy, compassion covering his 
usually stern countenance. Finally 
he went out, shaking his head and 
muttering, “Dammit — ” 

Shan immediately got to work 
on the tapes. Tryss ignored his 
brother and instead watched Shan 
sorting. At once he saw the se- 
quence and tried to help. That was 
a sharp little mind and we all knew 



A HELPING HAND 



153 




that in just a few years it would be 
buried under a moronic expression 
like Berayn’s. 

I stared at Berayn. He gazed 
back. There was no spark of inter- 
est in his face. No resentment, 
either. He was a living epitome of 
don’t-give-a-damn and he was no 
exception. The whole adolescent 
and adult native population of 
Jeel had the same who-cares atti- 
tude toward life. 

Tryss was still pawing through 
the tapes. “This one here? Ah! 
And this one come after number 
five!” 

But, then, Tryss was only elev- 
en, not fourteen. 

I picked up the latest printout 
again and studied it. My talent is 
supposed to be looking at things 
in an unusual way, detecting pat- 
terns that those closer to the forest 
might miss. So far, on this planet, 
1 hadn’t earned my keep. 

“Something?” Shan said hope- 
fully. 

“Yes. At puberty the Jeeli stop 
developing intellectually. Not only 
that, they lose much of what 
they’ve learned throughout child- 
hood.” 

Shan’s mouth quirked. He was 
obviously annoyed that for an 
instant I’d given him the impres- 
sion I’d found something new. 
“Don’t we all?” 

O N WORLDS where conditions 
permitted Shan and I liked to 
walk after work in the evening — 



if there was an evening on that 
particular planet. It was the time 
allotted to bounce ideas off each 
other, to play Let’s See What We 
Have So Far. That evening after 
D’Vrainy’s visit was no exception. 
“At least the Jeeli aren’t dying or 
in danger of extinction,” Shan 
muttered, not sounding cheered. 

“Just in perpetual stagnation. 
Anthro says they’ve been this way 
for a long time — that well-pre- 
served burial they found dated out 
to around two hundred thousand 
Terran years.” 

We were both trying to avoid 
thinking of the possibility of Relo- 
cation for the Jeeli. It would be 
necessary, though, for their own 
safety, during the industrialization 
of their planet — unless we could 
find the key to unlock their minds 
and bring them up the ladder. Shan 
viciously slung a pebble down the 
grassy slope we stood on. Below us 
a cluster of crude dwellings strag- 
gled about a little stream, each un- 
workmanlike hovel sporting a 
flimsy porch. “Look at that. They 
were building those same primitive 
shacks when that burial was made 
and they build them the same way 
today, without any change whatso- 
ever. Do you suppose they’ll fix up 
those two that have fallen down or 
just move in with their relatives?” 

“Oh, they’ll rebuild them even- 
tually, maybe, when the kids get 
energetic and- provide the enthusi- 
asm and direction. In this climate 
there’s no big rush.”

IF 




“There is for us. While we ex- 
amine and reexamine them more 
Jeeli are turning into mental mush. 
The whole culture is climbing a hill 
— and it never gets to the top. The 
average Jeeli gets no higher than 
fourteen years up that hill, then he 
gets thrown back down again and 
stays there. We’ve got to change 
that.’’ 

It hurt. It hurt all of us. You 
didn’t get into Ethnic Research of 
the Division unless you psych 
tested with powerful empathic atti- 
tudes toward primitive peoples, a 
tremendous desire to assist. Some- 
times it wasn’t necessary to push, 
only show the way; but Survey had 
established, easily, that Jeel wasn’t 
in that category. And here we were 
drowning in the results of that clas- 
sification. Everything in our train- 
ing and psychology pointed us to- 
ward helping underdeveloped spe- 
cies up their individual cultural 
ladders. We just couldn’t ignore 
them. 

Tryss puffed up the hill toward 
us, a big grin on his face. “Doctor 
Carteret say last test is point nine- 
nine CO — CO — ” 

“Correlation,” I finished for 
him. Sometimes I wondered if 
Carteret ever rested. He dug at 
every problem until he had it 
licked, though it was possible that 
this time he’d meet defeat. I rubbed 
the top of Tryss’s hairless head, 
trying not to blame the messenger 
for bad news. “So much for that 
theory.” 



Shan shook his head. “Poor 
kids. How do they ever learn any- 
thing? They certainly don’t get any 
education from their elders. 
They’re almost feral children.” 

“But they seem happy.” 

Tryss had gone back several me- 
ters from the slope and hunkered 
under the low-hanging branches of 
a tree, even though it wasn’t hot. 
And at the sight something jolted 
me. Jeeli children rarely sought 
shade. But all the adults — and the 
adolescents as they neared or 
reached puberty — got out of the 
sun as much as possible even when 
the light was dim, as now. Under 
trees, under those ridiculous 
porches. When they changed to 
their useless, lethargic state they 
sought — trees, porches, shelter. I 
sat down beside Tryss, ignoring the 
threat of fierce stains from the Jee- 
lian version of fescue. From the 
way I felt I was probably bugeyed 
but Tryss didn’t seem to think me 
impolite. He returned my look 
with a wondering smile, apparently 
thinking this was a game. 

“The learning process itself,” I 
said slowly and carefully. My 
thoughts were moving fast. 
“What?” 

“How do humanoids learn — or 
most mammals?” 

“That’s your department,” Shan 
said in a halfhearted attempt at a 
teasing reply. He sat down on the 
other side of Tryss. “Go on.” 

“The learning process is largely 
a response to stimuli.” 



A HELPING HAND 



155 




“Okay. Burn your hand on an 
object and learn not to.” 

“Right. Or have a pleasant ex- 
perience and try to repeat it.” I 
chewed my knuckles a moment, 
trying to get mentally organized. I 
had a suspicion I was going to kick 
myself for my earlier stupidity 
when I got where I was heading. 
“But if the stimulus-response pat- 
tern were interfered with — ” 

“We’ve tested for native drugs.” 
Shan sighed. “They’re not on any- 
thing like, say, coca leaves.” 

Tryss was getting bored. The 
game wasn’t much fun and we were 
using words he didn’t understand. 

“No, but what if it were some- 
thing the body itself produces? Not 
from the outside but from within. 
Like histamines.” 

“It would have been present in 
the adults when we examined 
them.” Despite his arguments, 
Shan was beginning to catch my 
excitement. 

“Sure! But did we know what 
we were looking for? We were 
checking mostly for foreign sub- 
stances. This unknown quality 
would appear to be a natural, an 
element that belonged in their bod- 
ies. It would probably be present in 
the kids’ systems, too — but the dif- 
ference might be so minute we 
didn’t spot it before.” 

“We’ve already run total physi- 
cals on scads of specimens and the 
stuff is long gone. That means new 
tests and new specimens,” Shan 
said with a groan. 



I waved away this annoyance. 
“What we need is — ” 

“A lot of test stimuli and a pair 
of Jeeli twins who will enter puber- 
ty all at once, overnight on succes- 
sive nights. Only it doesn’t happen 
that way.” 

“Would you settle for a pair of 
brothers, one pre-, one post-pu- 
bertal?” 

“Tryss and Berayn?” He looked 
skeptical. “I doubt if they’d think 
much of new blood and tissue sam- 
ples, either.” 

I grinned reassuringly at Tryss, 
feeling like a Judas. “No, but 
they’re close at hand and we know 
their data better than most of our 
specimens. And — ” 

Tryss smiled back at us and I 
knew Shan was feeling my own 
nerve-wracking compulsion to 
solve this problem at any cost. 
We’d been programed, as it were, 
by our own culture, our own emo- 
tional learning processes. 

Shan said it for both of us, 
“None of us wants to see Tryss be- 
come like Berayn.” 

F|’VRAINY wasn’t happy 
about the idea of using Tryss 
and Berayn as guinea pigs. He was 
kindly enough to shrink from the 
thought of what we might do to 
them. 

“You said a free hand,” Shan 
reminded him and Carteret nodded. 

D’Vrainy studied the two boys 
uneasily. They were not clear on 
what was expected of them but 



156 



IF 




they recognized his authority and 
awaited his decision, Tryss appre- 
hensively, Berayn blankly. 

Carteret said, “We wouldn’t 
take this approach if we didn’t have 
every anticipation of a successful 
conclusion.’’ Shan glanced sharply 
at his cochief, opened his mouth 
to argue, then shut it. “This team 
wants to see the Jeeli’s minds un- 
fettered.” 

“Unfettered. Yes.” D’Vrainy 
had started at the word, then 
smiled. His big hands fell on the 
shoulders of the brothers. I 
couldn’t grasp much of the follow- 
ing conversation he had with them 
— the tapes couldn’t teach me that 
fast and D’Vrainy had almost two 
hundred days’ head start — but it 
seemed to encourage them both. 
I caught the word “Duty” and an- 
other phrase which might have 
translated as “Noble Help.” Tryss 
drew himself up proudly and even 
Berayn looked mildly impressed. 

Persuasion done, D’Vrainy 
shrugged his feathered shoulders 
and gave us a parting shot: “And 
try not to stick them with needles.” 

We didn’t enjoy doing so. But 
despite the advances of medicine 
through the centuries there still 
wasn’t any way for our techs to 
get blood or several other kinds of 
tissue samples out of a humanoid 
body without poking it with a sy- 
ringe or punch. (There’d been 
some experiments with alterna- 
tives, of course, years back. But 
the Bekart Method — a kind of 



radical osmosis — tended to leach 
out a lot of other things along 
with the desired sample and leave 
patients in rather nasty conditions. 
It had been abandoned for the old- 
er, surer, more painful method.) 
Tryss yelled a lot but Berayn 
didn’t seem to mind our proce- 
dures at all. 

Shan and I exchanged glances 
and he raised his eyebrows. “Josy, 
you may have spotted the tree 
amid the forest again.” 

I cued the comp log, feeling cau- 
tiously elated. “Not only less alert 
as adolescents but they have a dis- 
tinctly higher pain threshold. We’d 
sort of assumed that the kids we 
picked for earlier samples yelled at 
the needle because most humanoid 
kids from nonstoic cultures do.” 

“I don’t think Berayn’s being a 
stoic,” Shan said firmly. “He just 
doesn’t seem to feel pain as much 
as Tryss does.” 

And with each test that initial 
conclusion was more and more 
strongly reinforced. Tryss became 
hysterical at the sight of a needle 
or anything that resembled one. 
After our first traumatic experi- 
ences with him, we made very sure 
to take a large enough sample to 
last for any number of tests. I had 
never seen any e.t. child react quite 
so violently, not just with tears and 
protests but with white-lipped, al- 
most convulsive panic. 

Berayn on the other hand took 
the whole thing with equanimity. 
We’d thought at first we might

have to ply him with a lot of food 
to keep him pacified, but he made 
no fuss at all. Just as well, since he 
didn’t seem to have a great deal of 
interest in food beyond his basic 
requirements. Enthusiasm for ev- 
erything seemed to diminish after 
whatever it was happened to the 
Jeeli. It was a marvel the entire 
race hadn’t died out. 

Sooner than I’d hoped I spotted 
something suspicious on the tape. 
Apparently my expression must 
have been a giveaway, because be- 
fore I could get my mouth open 
Shan, Carteret and several key bio 
people trotted toward me. 

“Something?” Shan said. 

Research put me on the team 
because I have a special feeling for 
puzzles, including multi-track 
comp tapes. I like to study lots of 
threads and then see how the pieces 
are going to come together. That 
Qualified Tech First in psych 
wouldn’t have been enough by it- 
self (I’d completed it, however, 
knowing I couldn’t get anywhere 
without a degree), but Assignments 
regarded my ability to generalize 
as a valuable stock-in-trade for 
our line of work. Right now the 
puzzle pieces were falling into 
place so fast I had a feeling they 
were dragging me along with them. 

I pointed to the comp tape. Ta- 
kana, our bio expert, leaned over 
my shoulder to watch. “Pull to- 
gether neuro and hemo for a start. 
Allow for a quantitative difference 
because it’s a different species. 



Now doesn’t this look like a loss 
here, in Berayn’s sensory and mo- 
tor responses? Mostly in sensory, 
if I read right, a bit less inhibition 
in motor.” 

Shan shuffled his feet and 
chewed his thumb while Carteret 
and Takana tapped the comp for 
elaborating data. The machine did 
some mechanical nail biting and 
began spitting out fresh readings. 
Questions started immediately and 
I had to hold up a hand to fend 
them off while I read the results. 

“Yes — I remember now! Read 
me out: Transmitting nerve im- 
pulses involves a shift in sodium 
and potassium ions, right? Accord- 
ing to the comp, at this point it 
spotted a slowdown in that process 
in Berayn. Not an interference by 
our species’ medical standards, but 
apparently by his.” Takana was 
nodding, too busy tracing a line onr 
the tape to comment. “It’s the ion 
shift. It’s being inhibited — and se- 
lectively.” 

“Let me see that,” Carteret in- 
sisted. He pushed between us, join- 
ing Takana, hunched over the 
comp. I knew why they always 
gave us printout rather than voice 
comps: people like Carteret didn’t 
believe anything unless they could 
see it. I hoped I hadn’t goofed. I 
could imagine Carteret’s report to 
Division if I had. Shan might have 
let it slide but not our take-charge 
boy. But, if I were right, he’d know 
that, too; Carteret had few equals 
in neuro. First he muttered to him-

IF 




self, then said to his tech, “Pull 
our earlier tapes on dendrite sam- 
ples.” 

“We got something?” Shan 
pleaded. He was even more alone 
than I was, stuck in an administra- 
tive rut and only occasionally get- 
ting back to his beloved mycology. 

“We’ll let you know.” 

Checking and rechecking pro- 
ceeded hastily. We all felt the 
quickening sensation of a growing 
conviction we were finally on the 
right track. Shan and Carteret both 
fidgeted every time we warned 
them not to call D’Vrainy yet. We 
had to be sure. 

Finally Takana began scribbling, 
confirmed himself with the comp, 
frowned, scratched out a line or 
two. He and Carteret put their 
heads together over the paper, add- 
ing, paring. Suddenly they stopped 
and looked at each other, stJU’tled, 
Carteret’s pointed hawk nose close 
to Tak’s rounded oriental one. 
Tak slithered the paper to me. 

I drew back from it unhappily. 
“Chemistry isn’t my department, 
you know.” It looked vaguely fa- 
miliar, though, even to me. “Is 
that a kind of— aspirin?” 

“Yes and no.” Carteret was 
looking very smug. “I don’t think 
it would cure any of our head- 
aches. It’s a subtly different com- 
pound, quite subtly, which is one 
reason we didn’t spot it before. It’s 
unlike anything we’ve hit else- 
where. Definitely acetic acid there 
and some other things we can 



break down pretty quickly.” 

“But we already know what it 
does,” Tak broke in enthusiastical- 
ly. “It — in the case of the Jeeli — 
interferes with the shift between so- 
dium and potassium ions necessary 
for nerve impulse transmission. 
You were right, Josy.” 

“Works predominantly on in- 
take rather than output, as you 
said,” Carteret gloated. “But on 
both to some degree.” He didn’t 
quite rub his hands together but 
the aura of greedy triumph was 
very much there. 

“And its quantity is negligible in 
pre-pubescent Jeeli?” 

“You don’t know the half of it! 
Now that we’ve found what to 
look for the comp’s turned up 
plenty of previous correlations. 
Gradual increase until by Berayn’s 
age they’re flooded with it. Like 
natural histamines in our species, 
the body produces it. No outside 
source. All the Jeeli have some of 
it, but the pressures of maturation 
seem to push production into high 
gear at puberty, when there are 
plenty of other things like hor- 
mones running around in their sys- 
tems which effectively mask it — 
unless you look very closely.” 
“Josy?” Shan said plaintively. 
“Now you can call D’Vrainy.” 

< HEN you can lick it? You 
A can cure them?” D’Vrainy 
had only needed the barest run- 
down to grasp the point and slice 
through our burbles of discovery.

'"So their bodies drug themselves 
for some unknown reason/’ 
“Evolutionary side pocket,” 
Carteret explained, “like a wisdom 
tooth in a Terran. Once needed but 
now useless and, if it’s a problem, 
easily removed. Same with the Jee- 
li and their ‘aspirin’.” 

“Maybe,” Takana said. 

D’Vrainy looked at him sharply. 
‘'You aren’t agreed?” 

“We’re agreed that as long as 
this process goes on the Jeeli aren’t 
going anywhere culturally,” Shan 
said. Carteret and Takana both 
nodded. “With their stimulus re- 
ception severely muffled, not only 
learning but most other activity re- 
quiring much initiative or creativi- 
ty has come to a halt. It’s amazing 
they’ve progressed as far as they 
have with their rudimentary agri- 
culture and those travesties they 
call buildings. We can probably 
credit those to a lucky series of 
child geniuses some time in their 
past.” 

“But we’re certain we’ve found 
the loopholes,” I finished. 

“What’s the holdup, then?” 

“A choice has to be made,” 
Shan said, “on the advisability of 
going through that loophole. It’s 
different from* simply removing a 
native drug sour'ce or some other 
outside chemical influence. This is 
tricky. We ought to be able to 
counteract the stuff that’s turning 
them into zombies but — ” 

D’Vrainy was plainly annoyed. 
“That was the whole object in 



bringing you here! If you can’t 
cure them, what good are you?” 
There were a number of visible 
winces around the group. 

“There might be unexpected 
consequences,” Shan said slowly, 
“some unpleasant side-effects we 
can’t anticipate. The comp tells 
us the same condition doesn’t pre- 
vail in any other existing Jeelian 
species, and that our chances of in- 
ducing them in a lower life form 
are nil. The chem people, at least, 
are sure we can find a way to over- 
ride this natural super-aspirin they 
have running around in their neural 
synapses. But we can’t predict ex- 
actly what will happen when the 
overriding agent is ministered.” 
“It’ll wake them up?” 

“We can wake them up,” Car- 
teret said with happy dogmatism. 

“And the results might be a bit 
much to handle,” I warned. “It 
might make them — well, aggres- 
sive, for instance. The Jeeli have no 
history of war. Stimulated, jolted 
out of their millenia-long lethargy, 
they might discover their neighbors 
annoyed them and start bashing in 
their heads right and left. We cer- 
tainly went through a long enough 
period of that sort of thing, still 
are to some extent. Can we afford 
to take a chance of doing such a 
thing to the Jeeli?” 

D’Vrainy strolled back and 
forth, flapping his cloak. He was 
plainly struggling over it, and I 
didn’t envy him. It was hard to dis- 
like the Jeeli; but leaving them in 



160 



IF 




their present state was out of the 
question. Yet we had to be sure 
this was the key that would open 
their culture up. “You have other 
reservations?” D’Vrainy said, eye- 
ing us suspiciously. 

“Any time you tinker with the 
body chemistry of a living thing, 
you’re gambling,” Shan said. 
“Sometimes it works out wonder- 
fully, like the discovery that we 
could force the human body to 
produce its own antibodies. In a 
few other cases we haven’t been so 
fortunate.” 

D’Vrainy glanced to his right. 
Tryss and Berayn sat there, play- 
ing a game involving colored peb- 
bles and quick responses. At least, 
Tryss was playing. Berayn was get- 
ting skunked, but then it was a 
child’s game. He just couldn’t 
move quickly enough to compete 
any more. As a compensation of 
sorts he seemed to have lost much 
of the urge to compete. He didn’t 
become angry at his losses but just 
made feeble grabbing motions for 
the pebbles and occasionally 
chuckled embarrassedly. 

“Go ahead,” D’Vrainy finally 
ordered, a man stepping onto an 
ocean covered with thin ice. “Open 
up Berayn’s mind, if you can, and 
the rest of the Jeeli’s minds. We 
have to take the risk. See if you 
can unshackle them.” 

I T HADN’T taken at all long for 
our chem boys to find a simple 
counter to the natural salicylic. 



phenol, or whatever. They tossed 
around the terms interchangeably, 
it seemed to me, with “neo” and 
“Jeeli” tacked onto their coinings 
as suffixes or prefixes, depending 
on their disciplines. 

“You’ve got something like it 
right there in your hand, Josy,” 
Takana said, laughing. I glanced 
down at my cup of caffe. “We’ve 
been habituated to caffeine for sev- 
eral centuries now. It’s only fair 
the Jeeli get their own version.” He 
held out his hand and displayed a 
gel containing an unappetizing 
gray powder. “Native sources — 
and more than enough. We had 
several kilos this morning, even be- 
fore the test animal experiments. 
The Jeeli can be taught to refine it 
by themselves. With the effect this 
stuff will produce, it’ll be easy to 
teach them how.” 

“I’d like a test on Berayn,” Shan 
said, annoyed, “when and if we 
ever have a complete staff once 
again. Where is everybody?” 

“Oh, Carteret and his boys went 
off somewhere as soon as we got 
the comp confirmation. He took 
most of what we had of the stimu- 
lant; I think he wanted to tell 
D’Vrainy in person.” 

“I’m sure. An ordinary com call 
couldn’t suffice for such a triumph 
as this.” 

“Indeed it wouldn’t.” Speak of 
the devil. Carteret and what 
seemed like half our staff— his 
techs and other acolytes — trooped 
in. They all looked inordinately 



A HELPING HAND 



161 




pleased with themselves and some- 
thing in their manner gave me a 
chill. 

“Would it be all right if we pro- 
ceeded with the experiment?” Shan 
said icily. 

“It hardly seems necessary, you 
know.” Carteret’s techs were be- 
ginning to shut up some of their 
equipment in what was obviously a 
close-down phase. “The comps told 
us what we needed to know and 
I’ve already given D’Vrainy what 
he wanted.” 

“What?” Shan’s voice was low 
and shaking. 

“Of course. I gave him enough 
to distribute immediately to the 
Jeeli water sources. His crews are 
busy dumping it now. By morn- 
ing—” 

“Without a live test?” Shan was 
outraged but helpless against that 
totally confident personality of his 
cochief. 

“Don’t you believe your own 
comps? D’Vrainy does. And Vm 
sure Division will, especially when 
we can tell them how the Jeeli are 
moving forward.” He waved a neg- 
ligent hand. “Oh, go on with your 
individual test. It’ll make you feel 
better — and your report will add 
that nice touch of humanity to the 
comp printout.” 

Shan nodded grimly to Takana 
and the little oriental approached 
Berayn. The boy sat propped up 
against the wall, a bowl of half- 
eaten food in his lap. He didn’t re- 
act when Tak and his team 



swarmed around him. Without 
protest he submitted to the elec- 
trodes, the blood pressure cuff and 
all the other impedinnenta inter- 
fering with his meal. Takana of- 
fered him a capsule and Berayn 
swallowed it without hesitation. 

We waited less than five minutes 
and the results were overwhelming. 

Berayn’s eyes widened and he be- 
gan to look around, not with his 
usual bland lack of interest but 
with an expression that strongly re- 
sembled panic. One of the techs 
dropped a lid on a case and the boy 
jumped — literally — about half a 
meter. 

“More alert all ready,” Carteret 
began smugly, then stopped. 

“Nooo — ” Berayn said, slither- 
ing up the wall, spilling the bowl 
of food down his thighs and onto 
the floor. The techs moved hastily 
to accommodate his change of po- 
sition, shuffling tubes and wires 
trailing from his body. 

Shan stepped forward, planning 
to call a temporary halt. He didn’t 
have time. 

Takana and the techs tried to be 
soothing and Berayn swiveled to 
face them with eyes that were 
bright and terrified. His lips peeled 
back like a frightened animal’s. 
“Nooo — ” he wailed again, putting 
his hands tightly against his ears. 
He felt the electrodes on his scalp 
and ripped them away. One of 
them caught, drew blood. Berayn 
screamed and flailed against the 
wall, obviously in agony.

“Stop it! Get that injection to 
counter ...” 

Tryss rushed toward his brother, 
horrified at what was happening. 
They two shouted at each other in 
Jeeli and all the while Berayn beat 
away his “attackers” and their at- 
tempts to help him. He suddenly 
seemed terribly strong for a small, 
adolescent extra-terrestrial. 

Suddenly, on top of everything 
else, the com buzzed on. I saw 
D’Vrainy’s image come into focus, 
and his expression, half tragic, half 
enraged, was a study. He was roar- 
ing. “Get Carteret on this line!” 

Carteret looked stunned as he 
crossed to the com, a man with a 
theory crumbling under his feet. 



1 couldn't spare the attention to 
hear what D’Vrainy might say to 
him because the struggle with Be- 
rayn had become a desperate bat- 
tle. Abruptly the boy tore loose 
from everything, the hoses and 
equipment flapping behind him like 
streamers. He ran for the door of 
the lab. Takana and the others 
pelted after him, shouting assur- 
ances and pleas to stop that only 
made Berayn yell the louder. 

They all clattered out. The boy’s 
screaming still rang in our ears 
when Shan and I followed them 
long seconds later. We paused on 
the threshold, stunned. 

Tryss was standing amid the de- 
bris of the porch, sobbing. “Berayn 
hurt — hurt all over. You give him 
something make him hurt — ” 

“We were trying to help him,” 
Shan apologized. “How did he 
hurt?” 

Sniffling, Tryss said, Ears hurt. 
Eyes hurt. Feet hurt where you 
stand on ’em. Air hurt when it 
push against you.” Then he added 
with great wistfulness, “Just like 
it do me sometimes. Keep hurt — 
hurt more and more. But when 
you get Berayn old, hurt go away.” 

“You didn’t tell us that,” Shan 
said weakly. 

“Everybody little hurt,” Tryss 
said with horrible simplicity. I rec- 
ognized the tone from my teaching 
apprenticeship: childhood’s con- 
tempt for adult obtuseness. Of 
course. It wasn’t worth mentioning 
because it was a universal. Every-

body little hurt and Tryss was lit- 
tle. 

“But then it go away. When you 
get big, it go away.” 

“It goes away,” I said dully, 
feeling sick. “Because their bodies 
make it go away. Shan, we can’t 
help them without driving them in- 
sane or making them kill them- 
selves to escape. We took the 
wrong tack: in their species pain 
and pleasure aren’t learning stimu- 
li — they have to be avoided. The 
evolutionary side pocket isn’t the 
deadening agent; it’s the steadily 
increasingly painful stimuli they 
experience throughout childhood. 
Berayn’s condition is the normal 
one, the survival adaptation. And 
Tryss is just now approaching the 
age where his body, in self defense, 
will start manufacturing its own 
natural depressant.” 

“We used the mildest dosage 
we could,” Shan murmured. 

“Good thing. Right now Berayn 
is obviously being battered by 
stimuli, maybe far more than he 
ever was as a child; but he’s no 
longer able to take it. None of the 
adolescents or adults are — my 
God, Shan! Carteret! The native 
water supplies! Listen — ” 

Distantly, underlining Berayn’s 
fading shrieks, we could now hear 
other high-pitched Jeeli voices. 
They came from the direction of 
the nearest collection of hovels. I 
could visualize hundreds of pain- 
maddened Jeeli adults clawing at 
their heads, being torn apart by the 



flood of stimuli — from the gates 
we had all helped open. And know- 
ing D’Vrainy’s thoroughness, I had 
a sinking certainty that he’d sent 
the compound out to all his sta- 
tions, all over the planet and our 
scene of horror was being enacted 
many times over. Carteret had 
thrown the switch, I’d first given 
him the fuse and the rest of us all 
concdcted this — leg up a ladder to 
nowhere. 

I wanted to bawl with disap- 
pointment, to crawl into a corner 
where I wouldn’t have to hear or 
see the tortured Jeeli. “We’ve de- 
stroyed them! The children — they 
can’t — they’ll — they’ll have to be 
relocated. They won’t even have a 
culture by morning. Listen! The 
adults will be dead, or insane. Oh, 
Shan! What have we done!” 

Out in the dark Berayn was still 
howling. The pursuing techs were 
still trying to reach him through 
the avalanche of stimuli assaulting 
the boy — if only they could catch 
him. 

And a meter away from us, 
standing in the ruins of the porch 
roof, Tryss sobbed, trembling in 
empathic pain. We barely caught 
the word, “Porch — ” but his tone 
of pathetic pleading was plain. His 
hands were over his ears, trying to 
shut out his brother’s screams. But 
he couldn’t. We’d taken away their 
porches — their shelters against a 
world so incredibly painful we 
could barely imagine it. 

Or could we? Now? •

4400METHINGold and some- 
thing new; something bor- 
rowed, something blue.” It isn’t 
entirely inappropriate for science 
fiction, which represents something 
of a marriage between reality and 
a dream. It is also the fair begin- 
ning of a formula for writing, ex- 
cept that it should add a number of 
other items — the rest of the colors, 
something false and something 
true, and so on. But nowadays 
we’re lucky to have even the four 
elements worked into a book and 
the meaning of “blue” may apply 
to something other than mood. 

This time the something bor- 
rowed is represented by Roger 
Zelazny’s Nine Princes in Amber 
(Doubleday, $4.50). In this book 
he has borrowed from every legend 
I can remember of the marvelous 
land of Faerie. 



I suppose those who feel it in- 
cumbent to spot trends and see 
limits are going to carp at the fact 
that Zelazny is still sticking to 
myth (though not religion) for his 
inspiration. But since myth is the 
source of almost all our best liter- 
ature in one form or another, I 
can’t object. And I can very much 
applaud the fact that when Zelazny 
borrows, he turns it into an act of 
high creation. The borrowed ele- 
ments here are so well adapted and 
so much enriched by his own addi- 
tions and attitudes that the back- 
ground becomes one of the fresh- 
est lands of wonder in which I’ve 
roamed for some time. 

The Princes of the title are the 
nine sons of Oberon — a brawling, 
arrogant and contumaceous lot of 
varied and oddly-talented nobics. 
Oberon, it seems, has mysteriously 
been forced to give up his rule and 



U5 




he is either dead or somehow 
locked from contact. Now his sons 
are fighting for the rule of the 
kingdom of Amber. This world of 
Amber is the source world of all 
others — the reality from which our 
Earth and other lands are only the 
incomplete shadows across the in- 
finite planes of possibility. 

We follow Corwin, who has 
been exiled to Earth. And since 
the days of the years of Faerie are 
not as those we know, he has spent 
many centuries here. But now the 
ancient feud with the apparent vic- 
torious prince, Eric, is reaching a 
new phase. Corwin, following an 
attempt to murder him, is bereft 
of much of his memory and most 
of his powers, but none of his wits. 
He sets about working his way 
back to Amber. And once he man- 
ages that return, he is caught in 
the ancient struggle as Eric tries 
to become crowned the king of 
Amber. 

The cast of characters is rich 
and varied and the lands through 
which we are led are excellently 
conceived. Plot and counterplot 
work well. And above all, there is 
a richness of texture and mood to 
the book, together with a fine in- 
ventiveness. It should be a novel to 
be recommended without quibble. 

Unfortunately, it isn’t a novel. 
It’s the beginning of one and noth- 
ing more. At the end we are left 
with a fine collection of unresolved 
items and a hero who is merely 
free to do what he has been tem- 



porarily stopped from achieving. 
But he has achieved nothing yet. 
Oberon, who appears as a voice 
that must eventually be significant, 
is simply dropped. A number of 
other characters must eventually 
also reappear — both nobles and 
commoners. The background for 
the story is laid but the story is not 
yet told. 

Obviously there must be a se- 
quel — perhaps more than one. 
(This has every earmark of the 
first book in a trilogy, judging by 
the pacing and what has developed 
within its large frame so far.) It 
makes what one may consider an 
excellent first installment of a 
three-part (hardcover book) serial. 
But it doesn’t make very fair treat- 
ment for the reader, at the price. 

There has been a tendency lately 
for writers to fall into the practice 
of doing books that are incom- 
plete (or which have a contrived 
but unsatisfactory ending grafted 
on) with the idea of a series in 
mind. I frankly resent it. If the 
writer can work out an ending that 
seems satisfactory and complete, 
there is nothing wrong with as- 
sorted sequels. But if he can’t or 
doesn’t choose to, it seems to me 
the whole should be published as 
one book. This semi- novel runs 
to perhaps 60,000 words. Three 
times that length is not impossible 
as a single volume. And I’d much 
rather pay the extra cost to get 
something that can be judged as a 
whole than to buy it in parts with 



166 



IF 




no certainty of when the rest may 
come out. 

Since no book can ever be better 
than its final resolution of its basic 
elements — writers, please note — 
and since there is no resolution 
here, I can’t make an honest at- 
tempt to judge it. Zelazny’s previ- 
ous performances make me feel 
the whole will be well worth the 
trouble of buying all parts, but 
this is a matter of faith only; and 
too many slips can occur before 
the totality can be gained. 

Buy it if you like to play guess- 
ing games with the possibilities an 
author raises — or if you are will- 
ing to wait for a year or more for 
the second installment. Otherwise, 
why fatten the income of publish- 
ers who would rather print books 
than serve their readers with hon- 
est novels? 

W ILSON TUCKER has given 
us something blue — in the 
classic sense of blue mood, not 
blue material. His Year of the 
Quiet Sun (Ace Special, 750) is es- 
sentially downbeat from the begin- 
ning. As such, in most ways, it is 
an excellent work. Most of the 
development in this story of a re- 
search program designed to ex- 
plore the future directly to spot 
“trends” is rather obvious — but 
it’s handled in such a way that the 
lack of uncertainty in no way de- 
tracts from the interest of the 
book. 

At first I hoped this was going 



to be another book I could use 
like Tucker’s Time Masters. 
That was one I considered perhaps 
the best example of true science 
fiction (aliens among us, immor- 
tality, space research, etc.) that 
was suitable for the general read- 
er; I’ve read it as such several 
times myself and lent it to several 
readers who thought they couldn’t 
like science fiction. 

The writing is generally up to 
Tucker’s very high standard. And 
there is an element of mystery and 
allure added to the future search 
by the use of myth, in the form of 
an ancient “lost book” of biblical 
writing. (This, I’m afraid, turns 
out to be of minor importance and 
rather less than full conviction, un- 
like his use of Gilgamesh in the 
other book.) 

But too much of the real depth 
of this novel has been wantonly 
butchered by the use of a trick that 
should never have been used. The 
hero, while waiting for his trip in 
the time device into the future, vies 
with another man for the girl who 
supervises everything. It’s impos- 
sible to see why, and we get a list- 
less and spineless impression of 
him. (It’s also a bit hard to see why 
he wants her, but that’s his prolv 
lem; and if honestly stated, it 
might have been convincing.) 

The key factor seems to be one 
that comes up after most of the 
novel is done. The girl is, of 
course, white; the narrator is 
black. Okay, he is then a man of 



READING ROOM 



167 




considerable complexity — a man 
who has externally overcome his 
background but is still obsessed 
with it internally. He should be 
a richly rewarding character. But 
since the reader is very carefully 
kept from this knowledge, and 
since it therefore plays no part in 
his thinking as revealed to us, we 
see none of this true character. Oh, 
we can go back and try to read it 
into the events; but the reason 
writers get paid for their work is 
because they are the ones best fit- 
ted to round out such character 
traits, not leave it to readers. 

The trick is unfair, since it de- 
mands a total reevaluation of all 
that went before after the reader 
has formed his impressions and 
since this is a story seen only 
through the one viewpoint. It is 
also unfortunate, since it reduces 
the character to a mere frame 
against which events can happen. 

The dedication of the book im- 
plies there is value to the ability to 
“grok,” and perhaps the reader 
is expected to go and do likewise. 

Buy the book if you want an ex- 
ercise in filling in character from 
the fact that I’ve spoiled the trick 
(which was inherently spoiled in its 
very conception.) Maybe that is 
grokking. But if you’d rather have 
your novel given its character de- 
velopment by the writer, pass this 
one by. 

B oth something very old and 
something new are contrib- 



uted in one massive book: Under 
the Moons of Mars, edited and 
with a history by Sam Moskowitz 
(Hold, Rinehart & Winston, $7.95). 
This fat book — running to 25t),000 
words, according to Moskowitz — 
deals with the second decade of this 
century in the pulp magazines, and 
traces the “scientific romance” as 
one of the sources of our litera- 
ture. 

Primarily, this is a source book 
for libraries. But to readers who 
can’t get a true feeling of the ex- 
erpted stories or who are curious 
about our beginnings, it strikes me 
as a bargain. It begins with a very 
brief introduction and then gener- 
ous samples of the works from 
major writers of the period. These 
run from the original form of what 
became Burrough’s Princess of 
Mars through The Moon Pool to 
Blind Spot. 

Most of these stories are avail- 
able now only in back issues of 
magazines almost as hard to get as 
the old Munsey publications where 
they first appeared. For anyone 
who cannot find the material else- 
where — which must mean for most 
readers 6f our literature — this is a 
fine chance to fill in a pretty fair 
picture of what made these works 
the classics they have become. In a 
few cases the entire stories are 
given; in other cases the samples 
are generous, covering significant 
portions of the work, and there has 
been no tampering, no condensa- 
tion of the text. 



168 



IF 




At the end, in what would be a 
longer-than-average book by itself, 
Moskowitz adds the history of 
the Munsey magazines (as well as 
a good deal of information on 
their competitors) during the peri- 
od of 1912 to 1920, when such 
stories were the backbone of their 
popularity. 

Most attention, naturally, is 
paid to Edgar Rice Burroughs and 
his dealings with the editors. This is 
a good deal less simple than might 
be thought; his rates of payment, 
the stories of his which were ac- 
cepted and which were rejected, 
and his whole affair with Munsey 
are covered in detail. But there is 
a good coverage of most of the 
other writers of the time, too. 

This is hardly material that is 
new to me in its broad outline. Yet 
when I sat down to skim through 
it quickly, I soon found myself 
reading it as I might have read a 



novel — with genuine enjoyment. 

There are places where I wish 
other treatment had been possible. 
Bob Davis as an editor had such a 
strong influence on American writ- 
ing for the next generation that I’d 
have liked to have seen more on 
him; yet this is not properly the 
province of the book, so I have to 
put that down as a purely personal 
desire. (And if anyone wants to do 
a biography of Davis, there are 
still plenty of writers he taught 
their craft, though this won’t be 
true much longer. So please, any- 
one out there . .) Within the in- 
tent of this history, however, I 
think Moskowitz has done a fine 
job. 

It should be stocked by every 
library. And for the fans who want 
to know how we got where we are 
(if that isn’t erewhon revisited), 
this is a book greatly to be recom- 
mended. •

It was Christmas — and all 



he wanted was to give! 



170 



F our days before Christmas I 
had my first of two troubles 
with the Creep and Della grew ill 
and Shambolain arrived — and noth- 
ing was ever quite the same after 
that. 

Ordinarily I would have been on 
the Street working the Bleeders for 
quarters and dimes, but the weath- 
er was miserable that day. When 
it’s a little cold the Bleeders are 
more generous because I look 
more pitiful, huddled and shivering 
against my begging wall; but when 
it gets really bitter they aren’t 
about to stop and freeze their fin- 
gers to find you a quarter. That 
day it was only ten above zero and 
the snow was coming down in fine, 
dry flakes. The wind was so strong 
that it made the driven snow stick 
to the bricks and it eddied in the 
angles of wall and walk, creating 
drifts that reformed as quickly as 
I cleared them away. 

I had only taken in two dollars 
and eleven cents in almost four 
hours, and I only needed one more 
excuse to head for home. And I 
got it: the Creep. 

This skinny guy in a heavy gray 
overcoat with fur collar moved up 
through the sheets of snow and 
dropped two quarters in my cup. 
He had been passing regularly for 
two weeks, always making heavy 
donations and always with a word 
about the weather. Most Straights 
don’t talk to Freaks, no matter 
how much they bleed for us. I sus- 
pected this skinny guy was a Creep, 



even though he looked bland and 
unimposing. 

“It’s going to be a mess soon,’’ 
he said. 

“Yeah,’’ I said, wishing he 
would go away. I’ve never really 
known how to talk to a Straight. 
Usually, my trick is to look him 
over for some vaguely Freakish 
feature like gigantic ears, a warted 
nose or eyes set too close together. 
Then I talk to the Freak part of 
him. But this Creep was too plain 
to harbor even the slightest abnor- 
mality. 

“You shouldn’t be out here on a 
day like this,’’ he said, gently lay- 
ing his hand on the hump between 
my shoulders. I froze. He made his 
gesture seem one of friendship but 
his fingers moved ever so slightly, 
trying to feel through the coarse 
weave of my coat. “You’re the one 
with the third foot,’’ he said. 

I didn’t say anything. What 
should I have said? 

“I’ve heard about you.’’ He said 
it as if he were complimenting me. 

The wind blew a stronger gust 
and we backed flat to the wall to 
get out of the worst of it. I stepped 
into a drift and felt my socks get- 
ting wet. 

“Do you have a third foot?’’ he 
asked. When I nodded, he said, 
“Where is it? I only see two 
shoes.’’ 

I looked into the cup I still held 
in a perpetual position of request 
(sometimes I wake up at night and 
find my hand held out, my fingers

bent around a tin vessel that isn't 
there) and saw the lousy pile of 
coins in the bottom. 

“On my calf,” I said, not look- 
ing at him, not looking anywhere 
but in the cup. 

“That’s why you wear the baggy 
pants,” he said thickly. 

Yes, damn it, yes, yes . 

We huddled against the cold, 
waiting for each other. He was the 
Creep, damn it. It was his move. 
He shouldn’t have expected me to 
ask. But he did. And we waited un- 
til I finally said, “You want to see 
it, don’t you?” 

“If I could,” he murmured. Even 
in the cold, whipping air and ob- 
scuring snow I could see the glim- 
mer of excitement in his eyes. I 
hate the Creeps. 

We stood a while longer. I was 
not going to take the next step. 
Damn him, that was his job if he 
was so interested. 

“How much?” he asked at last. 

I told him it would be five dol- 
lars. He got out his wallet, opened 
to a roll of a hundred and fifty 
bucks and peeled off the bill. I took 
it and stuffed it into my pocket, 
then stooped to roll up my pant- 
leg. 

“Not here,” he said. 

“No alley,” I told him. “No 
room somewhere. Here or no- 
where.” 

He looked disappointed, then 
shrugged. “Very well.” 

I rolled my trousers past the 
knee and turned my leg so he 



could get a good look. The shrunk- 
en, gray calf, almost muscleless, 
was puckered like a womb and 
gave birth to a half-sized foot oth- 
erwise perfect in detail. He looked 
for a long moment, breathing heav- 
ily, then reached out and touched 
it. I danced away and kicked his 
shin with my good leg, rolled down 
my trousers. 

“Look here — ” he started to 
argue. 

“You Creep!” I shouted. “I 
didn’t say you could touch it. No 
one said you could touch it, you 
stinking Creep — ” 

His face flushed and he turned, 
hurrying away through the snow, 
trying to look inconspicuous. I 
watched him go, wishing I had 
kicked him harder so he would 
hurt as much as me. With the 
weather being so rotten and the 
Creep so depressing, I couldn’t 
take the Street much longer. 

It was only two blocks to home, 
but it took me a while on account 
of my bum leg. My third foot was 
aching like a rotting tooth in the 
cold. When I finally reached the 
steps down into our cellar I gritted 
my teeth, gripped the icy iron rail- 
ing and hopped down on my one 
good foot. Twice my bum leg 
slapped against the concrete and 
made me gasp. Then I was through 
the door into our warm living 
room and my spirits lightened con- 
siderably. 

Jenifer and Sully were slouched 
in easy chairs — Jenny’s long, love-

ly, brown legs propped on a stack 
of magazines serving as ottoman. 
At twenty-two she was tawny, sup- 
ple, as much a cat as a girl. 1 ad- 
mired her legs, full hips, thrusting 
breasts bare under her sweater, 
and the thick fall of her dark hair. 
I also admired and loved her left 
arm which had no hand and the 
smooth-skinned concavity where 
her left eye socket should have 
been. I found these as beautiful 
as legs and breasts, for without her 
stigmata she would not have been 
with us. 

“It could have been bad,” I said. 
“Except I got a fiver from a 
Creep.” 

“Della’s dying,” Jenifer said. 
For the first time I saw the tears 
in her good eye. I didn’t know 
what to say. 

“There’s something wrong in- 
side,” Sully said, scrambling to 
the floor and balancing on his 
thick, hairy arms. He had no legs 
and his trunk was so abbreviated 
that he could walk on his overde- 
veloped arms. “There was blood in 
her bile, and she hurts a lot in her 
guts.” 

I got up and went to the door of 
Pike’s and Della’s bedroom. It was 
standing ajar; I pushed it open and 
went inside. There were no lights 
on but the snow-shielded sunlight 
filtered dimly through a casement 
window. Della lay on the bed and 
Pike knelt on the floor beside her, 
cradling her with his abnormally 
large paw. Pike’s head, swollen by 



acromegaly, turned and looked at 
me, almost as if it were separate 
from the rest of him. 

“Let’s get her to a hospital,” I 
said. 

“No.” His voice was deep and 
syrupy as always, though harsher 
now. 

“If it’s the money we can let the 
city get stuck with the bills.” 

“I don’t want her laughed at,” 
he drawled. “She’d be an amuse- 
ment to them. And she’s afraid; 
she made me promise not to take 
her away. She’d hate a hospital.” 

Then he started to sob. It was 
such a strange sound coming from 
his distorted throat that I didn’t 
realize immediately what it was. 
Besides, a Freak never cried. It just 
doesn’t pay. 

“It’s nothing the hospital can 
help,” he said. “You know she’s 
all twisted inside. She’s dying be- 
cause of the way she’s made. You 
can’t fight that. Nobody anywhere 
can do anything at all about that.” 

“The pain — ” I said. 

“We bought a bottle.” He indi- 
cated a half-empty fifth of vodka 
on the nightstand. But she still 
seemed to feel pain, now and then 
jumping and twisting in the sheets. 
The eye in the baseball-sized head 
bulging from the left sphere of her 
skull was open and staring. It was 
cataracted. “The other one,” Pike 
said, indicating the second head, 
“never opened its eye before. But 
now it knows.” 

I watched Della dying. I wanted

to do something but there was no 
action within my powers. 1 had a 
fleeting desire to tear up the fiver 
the Creep had given me but I knew 
that was foolishness. So I just 
stood there. And Jenifer and Sully 
stood behind, just inside the door- 
way, watching and waiting like 
Pike and me. And, I guess, like 
Della. 

It was then that Shambolain ar- 
rived. 

W ITH her dying Della had cre- 
ated a pocket in existence and 
we had crawled inside to await the 
end with her. Unnoticed, the 
stranger had come in from outside, 
crossed the living room to the 
doorway behind us. 

“Is something wrong?” he asked. 
Everyone turned to look at him 
— except Della who twisted and 
moaned. He was armless but it 
was his face that was truly strange. 
His head was an oval, thin and 
long, with eyes set too low so that 
there was a very long expanse of 
forehead between his hairline and 
brows. His nose was thin, close to 
his face and with little cartilage 
structure. His mouth was a bleak 
line, nearly lipless. His skin had a 
coppery glow that was oddly un- 
like a suntan. Still, he was a some- 
what handsome man. Rather, he 
was not handsome as a man, but 
handsome in his own right, on his 
own terms. 

“What do you want?” Pike 
asked, taking his frustration out 



on the stranger, his voice harsh and 
demanding. 

“No one heard my knock,” the 
stranger said. “I could see you 
standing here, so I came in. I hope 
I haven’t breached your etiquette.” 
The last sentence had an odd ring 
to it, as if he were trying to say in 
English something he had first 
phrased in a foreign language. “I 
asked about where I might find 
others — of my kind. They told me 
about you people.” 

“No room here,” Pike hissed. 
Behind him Della turned, sucked 
air and gagged. 

“She’s badly ill,” the newcomer 
said. “What is the sickness?” 

“No sickness,” I told him. “Her 
insides are abnormal. She often 
said the doctor expected her to die 
shortly after birth. It’s finally hap- 
pening.” 

He moved to the bed, kneeled 
beside Pike who briefly protested. 
He touched Della along the ribs 
and over the swollen bowl of her 
stomach. He had the quick move- 
ments and assurance of a doctor. 
He turned to me and motioned to- 
ward the living room. 

“Please get my case.” 

I brought the heavy piece of lug- 
gage to him. “You’ll have to do 
what’s necessary,” he said. “As 
you see, I have no arms.” 

His armlessness was of a strange 
type; his shoulders were bare in the 
sleeveless sweater he wore which 
seemed tailored specially for him 
and I could see that there were not 



174 



IF 




even stumps where arms should 
have started, but slightly concave 
basins in his shoulders, as if the 
limbs had been ripped out by the 
roots. 

I did what he asked of me and I 
never once wondered how he had 
transported the suitcase to our 
door when he had no arms. I would 
not think of that until much later. 

Within the case were many 
strange articles for which I could 
see no purpose, along with what 
appeared to be medical supplies. I 
filled a hypodermic syringe with 
heavy amber fluid and injected it 
into the puffed vein on Della’s arm. 
Slowly her movements became 
tamer. She settled, sighed and al- 
lowed herself the flicker of a smile. 
The cataracted eye closed. Fifteen 
minutes later she giggled girlishly 
and called Pike’s name. She said 
more though it seemed senseless. 

“You’ve doped her,’’ Pike said, 
not certain if this were good or 
evil. 

“No,’’ the stranger said. “A mild 
drug. The drug relieves the pain 
but it also creates hallucinations 
out of the happier moments of her 
past. She’s probably dreaming of 
being with you.” 

We left Pike with her and went 
into the living room where we 
learned that the stranger was new 
in the city, did not care to talk 
about his past (quite a common 
hangup among Freaks) and had 
but one name that served as his 
first, middle, and last, and that 



was: Shambolain. Like his voice, 
it sounded foreign to me. 

E arly that evening we made a 
blanket stretcher and carried 
Della to the funeral parlor for 
what simple service we could offer. 
Brunhoff, the undertaker, was al- 
ways willing to provide a cheap 
service as long as we came to the 
alley door and were willing to pay 
our last respects in the basement 
around the fiercely armored cre- 
mation furnace where none of his 
more elite customers might see us. 

Brunhoff dumped her onto the 
furnace tray, much as if she had 
not been a human being. Maybe, 
to Brunhoff, she had not been. Her 
head bounced against the metal. 
Pike made a move toward the un- 
dertaker but was blocked by Sully. 
Without Brunhoff, we would have 
had to accept city services which 
amount to nothing, lack dignity 
and burden the deceased, with the 
aura of a pauper’s grave. Brun- 
hoff grinned at Pike, egging him 
on, but Pike settled down. Almost 
dejected that a confrontation had 
not occurred, Brunhoff adjusted 
the furnace and slammed the 
corpse tray into the gaping red- 
flickered maw. We would never 
see Della again. 

The ashes were poured into a 
pretty perfume bottle we had 
brought for that purpose and Jeni- 
fer (our treasurer) took out our 
cash and asked Brunhoff for a 
price. We buried someone about 



SHAMBOLAIN 



175 




every two years and the price 
seemed to go up a few dollars 
every time, though the service re- 
mained the same. This time, he 
wanted twenty-five dollars more 
than before. 

“We can’t afford it,” Jenifer 
said. 

Brunhoff scowled. “Prices are 
up everywhere. You’d better be 
able to afford the rising costs or 
go elsewhere.’’ 

“Be reasonable,’’ Jenny said. 
“We’ll pay an extra five dollars.’’ 

“An extra twenty-five — plus 
forty-seven. Seventy-two dollars. 
And you’ll pay it now.’’ He was al- 
most a foot taller than any of us 
and at least two hundred and fifty 
pounds. When Jenny started put- 
ting our money away and explained 
we would go elsewhere from then 
on he snatched the bills from her, 
clenched them in his big fist. 

“Get out,” he said. 

He knew that none of us would 
argue. A cripple cannot afford to 
fight a bigger man for fear of be- 
ing further crippled 

“Give back the money,” Sham- 
bolain said. He came up beside 
Jenny, his long face showing an- 
ger. 

Brunhoff repeated his demand 
that we leave and called us Freaks. 
He started toward us and we began 
backing. Except for Shambolain. 
He stood his ground, his face get- 
ting darker and uglier. Brunhoff 
grabbed him by the shoulders, then 
made a sudden face. His cheeks be- 



came inflamed and his eyes bulged 
as if someone were throttling him. 
He released Shambolain and 
reached for his own throat. 

Shambolain said, “Pick up the 
money, Walt.” 

I went forward under Brunhoffs 
shadow and retrieved the cash from 
where it had fallen. As I stepped 
back, Brunhoff went to his knees, 
fighting for air, gagging thinly. He 
toppled onto his face and was still. 

“Is he dead?” Jenny asked from 
the doorway. 

“No,” Shambolain said. 

And we left. 

S ULLY moved in with Pike. 

Shambolain took the other bed 
in my room that had been Sully’s. 
Jenny still had her own room. I 
found it difficult to sleep that 
night, wondering what our new 
boarder would mean to us. When I 
did sleep I dreamed about the 
Creep. 

It was hypnotism. That’s what 
Shambolain told us he used on 
Brunhoff when we asked the next 
morning. He said he had been with 
a carnival and that he had learned 
his hypnotic skills from a show 
magician. We accepted the expla- 
nation. The only problem was that 
in the days to come he used it too 
often. 

Three days before Christmas, 
the day after his arrival, he used 
his “hypnotism” twice. First, he 
ran off two punks who were har- 
rassing Sully and me while we 



176 



IF 




were trying to teach him the art of 
hitting the Bleeders for quarters. 
But they ran like the pain was real 
and I thought 1 saw a touch of 
blood on one of the punk’s 
mouths where a “hypnotic” fist 
had struck him. He used it, later, 
to explain why he had collected 
more money in his half day alone 
than the rest of us combined. He 
swore he did not steal the money 
(though his interpretation of that 
word might have been different 
from ours; I think he saw all 
property as belonging to the com- 
munity of man and not to the in- 
dividual). 

Two days before Christmas he 
repeated his high gross and again 
turned all the money into our 
treasury. His generosity was what 
brought about his downfall. 

He did not seem to understand 
us. As Freaks, we had nothing but 
our self-respect with which to 
build the fragments of our disor- 
dered lives. At the heart of this 
self-respect was our pride in our 
ability to provide for ourselves, 
even at the expense of begging. 
For although we begged we did it 
well and all pride springs from ac- 
complishment. When Shambolain 
could so easily do better than our 
wildest dreams, there was no long- 
er much satisfaction in bringing 
home a good cupful of change. 
He could support us all and he 
wanted to. What, then, did our ef- 
forts matter? 

The day before Christmas we 



stayed home and let him gather 
alms for all of us. He came home 
richer than on either of the previ- 
ous two days and spread his gen- 
uinely startling take out on the ta- 
ble. Deep down we hated him for 
his competence. 

I T WAS late Christmas Eve that 
the trouble came. 

I should have forseen that our 
animosity would soon need a safe- 
ty valve. He had made Della’s last 
moments peaceful when all we 
could do was let her suffer; we 
could accept and even be thankful 
for that. Then he defeated Brun- 
hoff when the rest of us could only 
act like cowards. That, too, was 
good — except that it made the rest 
of us feel somehow inadequate. 
When he had driven off the punks 
Sully and I had felt foolishly in- 
ept — and slightly perturbed that 
he had not permitted us to take 
care of the situation on our own, 
as if we were children he had to 
protect. A Freak has a delicate 
regard for his manhood; to throw 
it in doubt is to drive him nearly 
to madness. Taking away our 
pride in earning our own way was 
his penultimate mistake. 

His final error was letting us 
find out what he really was. It 
came about like this: 

Although she felt like the rest of 
us, Jenny had been making it plain 
that she would welcome Shambo- 
lain into her bed occasionally, as 
she welcomed the rest of us. You 



SHAAABOLAIN 



177 




must remember that she was above 
all else a woman — now a woman 
intrigued by a new, mysterious and 
interesting man. When he finally 
accepted, blushing like a boy, they 
retired early. Sully and I were, per- 
haps, a bit jealous, though we 
have few taboos in our culture. 
Ptke, of course, could not care, 
for Della was only a few days 
dead and his thoughts found their 
focus on a small perfume bottle 
full of gray ash. 

They were in the bedroom for 
fifteen minutes before *Jenny 
screamed. At the sharp sound of 
her outcry we turned to look at the 
door. Her voice was now frantic, 
quick — though Shambolain spoke 
evenly and clamly, as if trying to 
soothe her. We could not under- 
stand what was being said but we 
had come to the edges of our seats 
like animals tensing to leap upon 
prey. I realized later that that was 
exactly what we were. 

Jenny came out of the room, a 
robe thrown haphazardly over her 
bare body. Shambolain followed 
almost sheepishly. She looked at 
each of us, her eyes wide and 
frightened and said, “He has 
hands.” 

We looked stupidly at her, un- 
able to comprehend. 

“While we were — ” She faltered. 
“I felt his hands on me — his fin- 
gers!” 

We looked at him and saw that 
he was confused, anxious. He re- 
turned our looks, concentrating 



the longest on me. There was a 
growing apprehension in his face 
and I suddenly realized Pike and 
Sully and I had advanced on him. 

“I do have hands,” he said quick- 
ly, his voice high and weak. 
“Look!” A figurine of a cocker 
spaniel rose off the end table to 
his left and floated across to Pike. 
“Take it,” Shambolain said. “And 
shake hands?” 

Pike hesitated, took the figurine. 
We could not see anything but we 
could tell from Pike’s expression 
that Shambolain’s invisible hand 
was shaking Pike’s free paw. 

For three days Shambolain had 
eaten his soup with a straw and 
his solids from his plate like a dog. 
He had hidden his invisible hands. 
We moved closer to him. I was 
barely aware that I was walking. 

“I was afraid you would not un- 
derstand,” he said. “1 wanted you 
to like me.” 

“What are you?” Pike asked, 
his heavy voice throbbing. 

“My people have never had arms 
or hands — even from earliest times, 
we had this power with our minds, 
this ability to manipulate matter. 
We evolved without hands, don’t 
you see?” He spoke fast, darting 
glances from one to the other of 
us, slowly backing away. “There 
werfe two of us that came here. An 
expedition. Maybe, if he had sur- 
vived, I would have been all right. 
But I needed company. I could 
never live alone. So I came to you. 
I want to be liked.” 



178 



IF 




We moved closer. 

“The ship,” he said, almost 
breathlessly now. “It could not be 
repaired, and Harrowmane was 
dead, squeezed against the dash 
console by the force of our drop. 
He didn’t have his belt on when the 
trouble started. 1 brought it in 
alone. None of my people will 
come for at least another thirty 
years — it takes that long to make 
the trip, you see.” 

“You’re not a man,” Sully said. 
Pike took up the phrase. 
“You’re not a man.” 

1 heard myself muttering. Per- 
haps I echoed them. 

“My God,” Jenny said, shud- 
dering. She hugged herself, then 
moved in on him like the cat she 
resembled. It was Jenny who broke 
the tableau, who brought out what 
was boiling beneath the surface of 
all of us. She struck him with her 
single hand, struck him again and 
again about the face. 



W E descended on him. My eyes 
seemed to unfocus so that 
the others were merely blurs of 
color as they swung and kicked. 
My own hands seemed to work of 
their own volition, separate enti- 
ties that pounded his chest and the 
concavities of his shoulders. Blood 
slicked my hands and I wiped them 
on my trousers, only to swing and 
slick them red again. I felt his ex- 
trasensory hands touching my 
face, trying to shove me back. I 



tore at him all the harder, match- 
ing the fury of the others. 

We would surely have killed 
him if 1 had not seen myself re- 
flected in his large, dark eyes. I 
moved in to pummel his face and 
somehow saw myself reflected in 
the watery surface of his eyeballs. 
My lips were contorted, drawn 
back over my teeth. My eyes were 
wide, my nostrils flared like those 
of an animal smelling blood. I do 
not know how I saw it — perhaps it 
was a trick of Shambolain’s. But 
the shock of the picture blasted 
through my mania and made me 
sick down into the pit of my stom- 
ach. I staggered back, breathing 
heavily, while the others continued 
the onslaught. 

I went back into the frenzy, 
shouted at them to leave him 
alone, pulled and tugged to get 
them away from him. They ignored 
what I said and twisted away from 
my hands. They had him in a cor- 
ner and he was bleeding badly. He 
seemed even to have stopped using 
his invisible hands to protect him- 
self. Pike drove a foot into his 
side. 

My fury returned — but was di- 
rected against the rest of them this 
time, not against Shambolain. I 
struck out, knocked Sully back- 
ward. He had been using his teeth 
on Shambolain; his mouth was 
bloody, his lips split. I swung on 
Pike, beat against him, kicked at 
his swollen shins until he cried out 
and wobbled back. 1 wrenched Jen-

ny loose, avoiding the Fingernails 
on her good hand and got between 
them and Shambolain. 

“What the hell are you doing?” 
she spat. 

“You’re acting like Creeps,” I 
said, almost hysterically. “Please 
don’t act like Creeps!” 

“He’s not a man,” Sully said. 
“He’s a monster,” Jenny whined, 
her face contorted almost beyond 
recognition. “A monster — ” 

“I don’t want him killed,” I said. 
“I don’t want us to be like this.” 
“Then get him out of here,” 
Pike said. “You take care of him.” 

I looked at them and realized 
there was no chance of my staying 
there. “I’ll get my two coats,” I 
said. “And my share of the money. 
Shambolain’s share, too. And his 
suitcase.” I looked them over care- 
fully. “You’ll let him alone until 
I’m ready to leave?” 

“Hurry,” Pike said. 

I got our things and took what 
money Jenny gave me from the 
fund, though it was only a fraction 
of what Shambolain had brought in 
from the Street. I found I could 
not take the suitcase, for I had to 
carry Shambolain. I took out the 
hypodermic and the bottle of am- 
ber dream fluid and left the rest 
behind. He could move a little and 
he helped me get him up, his arm- 
less body across my shoulder. We 
went out to the street, where it had 
begun to snow again. One of the 
others slammed the door behind 
us. 



W E SPENT that night in a 
flophouse for a dollar and a 
quarter. The winos in the other 
beds watched us curiously but none 
asked any questions or made any 
remarks. I pulled my bed next to 
his and wiped most of the blood 
off his face with wet paper towels 
brought from the filthy bath at the 
end of the room. He could talk a 
little, though his face was swollen 
and his words distorted. Most of 
it was delirium muttering anyway. 
I gave him a syringe full of the 
amber liquid he had given Della. 
He soon fell to gentle murmuring, 
pleased chuckles, and then into 
sleep. 

1 could not sleep much at all. 
Bad dreams kept waking me and 
my gut was bothered by cold chills. 

The next day, Christmas, I left 
him and went looking for a place 
we could make our permanent 
quarters. I found a basement room 
— half bedroom and half kitchen, 
with bath — only three blocks from 
our old home. It was under a dry- 
cleaning place and I found that the 
owner lived above his store. He 
was angry about having to show it 
to me on Christmas Day but he 
took my money and gave me the 
key just the same. It was a miser- 
able room but it had the advantage 
of being available. 

I brought Shambolain back, still 
carrying him, and put him to bed. 
He was in pain again, rolling and 
tossing, breaking open some of the 
delicate scabs that had formed over 



ISO 



IF 




his wounds. I gave him the last of 
the amber fluid. When he had set- 
tled into a comfortable trance I 
washed him and treated his wounds 
with some things I had bought at a 
drugstore down the block. For the 
rest of the morning I sat watching 
him, trying to straighten things out 
in my mind. I could not forget that 
I had reacted just like the others. 

After noon I decided that there 
was nothing to be gained by watch- 
ing him in his stupor. I should buy 
food and more medicines, the sta- 
ples to set up life here. I checked 
our money and was depressed at 
how little Jenny had given me. 
Christmas was a good begging day, 
even though there were few Bleed- 
ers out, for those who were out 
were willing to give more than usu- 
al. I put on my coat, took my cup 
and went outside. 

1 was making a fairly good dent 
in Bleeder pocketbooks and feel- 
ing better than 1 had since before 
Jenny took Shambolain to her 
bed. 

Then I saw the Creep. 

He was standing across the 
street, half a block farther up, 
mostly hidden in the entranceway 
to a shoe store. He still wore his 
gray coat with fur collar. He was 
watching me. I had no way of 
knowing how long he had been 
standing there and I Ml a bubbling 
of fear in my stomach. My legs 
grew weak. 1 tried to ignore him, 
but that was not possible. At last 
I dumped the change into my 



pockets, hooked my cup to my 
belt and decided to call it a day. 

I bought groceries and some 
medicine-cabinet supplies. When I 
came out of the store the Creep 
was gone from his post. It was 
spitting snow. I hurried back to 
our place. As I unlocked the door, 
balancing the groceries in one arm, 
the Creep came down the steps 
fast, slammed into me, and sent us 
both sprawling into the basement 
room. The groceries scattered 
across the floor. A milk bottle 
broke. I rolled over, got to my 
feet. 

“What the hell are you doing?” 

The Creep had a knife. 

He closed the door behind him 
and turned to look at me. I didn’t 
much like the look in his face. It 
suggested barely controlled mad- 
ness. He looked to the bed, to 
Shambolain. 

“Who’s he?” 

“A friend,” I said. “He’s sick. 
Real sick. Now get the hell out of 
here.” 

He grinned, strained his lips un- 
til it seemed his face would have to 
split. Then he looked serious. 

“I want to see the leg,” he said. 
When I told him to go to hell he 
waved the knife. “Undress. Hurry, 
please.” 

I started toward him. “You 
won’t use the knife. I know you 
Creeps,” 1 said. “You’re afraid of 
everything — and mostly of what’s 
inside your own head.” 

He swung the knife and gouged 



SHAMBOLAIN

my right hand. The blood welled up 
and dripped down on the cement 
floor where it looked impossibly 
black. 

“Undress,” he said. 

He waved the weapon. When I 
didn’t make a move to comply, he 
came at me, swung his other fist, 
and knocked me backward. I fell 
over an old chair, twisting my bum 
leg painfully. I tried to get up. He 
pushed me down again, hard. He 
had gone over the edge; he moved 
with the oiled smoothness of the 
mad. 

It was then that Shambolain 
threw the empty bottle that had 
contained the amber dream fluid. 
It bounced off the Creep’s skull 
and made him stagger back a step 
or two. When he turned to face 
Shambolain, the hypodermic 
syringe struck his neck like an 
arrow. He yelped, pulled it out 
and charged the bed. 

I tried to get up but fell again 
as a new wave of pain flushed up 
through my bad leg from the lump 
of my third foot. 

The Creep was struggling against 
Shambolain’s extra-sensory hands, 
choking for air. He tried to pull 
away, found that the invisible 
hands could follow him anywhere. 
He went down on his knees beside 
Shambolain’s bed, gurgling fran- 
tically. He fell flat, then pushed 
himself to his knees again. I saw 
the knife swing and I cried out 
to Shambolain. But the thin blade 
slid into his body, was withdrawn. 



The Creep swung again, plunged it 
in again. 

I got up, found the chair and 
somehow managed to carry it 
across the room. When I got there, 
the Creep was flat on the floor 
again, the knife fallen from his 
fingers, still unable to breathe. I 
supplemented Shambolain’s attack 
with the chair; I brought it up and 
down, up and down smashing it 
against the Creep’s skull until my 
arms were too weak to lift it again. 

But Shambolain was dying. I 
hovered over him, touching the 
knife wounds, trying to close them 
with my fingers. Blood sputtered 
throuth my fingers. He had red 
blood. I wondered if Jenny and 
Pike and Sully had noticed that 
Shambolain had red blood. I felt 
his invisible hands on my face. 
They touched it gently, cupped it, 
rested on my closed eyes. Then 
they faded slowly, as if the power 
to them was being leeched away. 
At last they were gone completely 
and Shambolain was dead. 

I dragged the Creep into the 
bathroom and cleaned up the blood 
by the bed. Since Brunhoff was no 
longer available, I was forced to 
call the city morgue. When they 
came I told them Shambolain had 
been knifed on the Street by some 
punks. I didn’t mention the Creep 
— I had plans for him. 

The next day there was a service 
at the morgue for Shambolain be- 
fore they boxed him in .tin and pine 
and took him away. It was a shod- 



182 



IF 




dy service. The clerk who read the 
words chewed gum throughout. 
They let me ride in the van when 
they went to the cemetery. They 
buried seven other paupers besides 
Shambolain and they buried them 
all standing up to save space. It 
seemed important that Shambolain 
be allowed to lie down in his grave 
but I couldn’t make the burial de- 
tail see it that way. We left him 
standing there, walled in by frozen 
chunks of earth. 

That night I dragged the Creep’s 
body out of the bathroom and 
took it outside. It was three in the 
morning and there was no chance 
of my being seen. I dragged him 
through the alleyways, four blocks 
until I came to a long row of trash 
cans behind a restaurant. I found 
an empty can, put it on its side and 
worked him into it. I got the can 
upright again and pushed on the 
lid. I left him there, squatting in a 
garbage can behind a cheap res- 
taurant. 

Since then I have come to real- 
ize that it started with the Creep 
and it ended with the Creep — and 
that means something. 

I saved Shambolain’s life when 



Jenny and Pike and Sully tried to 
take it; later, he died to save mine. 
His act was the act of a man. He 
had felt pain when he was hurt, just 
like a man, and he had bled when 
injured. He had touched me as he 
died, seeking comfort, and that 
must surely be seen as the act of a 
human being. What Shambolain 
knew — and what the rest of us 
must learn — is that the small dif- 
ferences do not matter, that phys- 
ical variations between men are 
only what they are. They mean 
nothing. The danger lies with the 
Creeps, who somehow have be- 
come warped, so that they need 
differences in human-kind to ex- 
ploit and feed on. 

I try to tell this to Jenny and 
Pike and Sully. I think, perhaps, 
they are beginning to understand. 
I heard Jenny crying last night. I’ve 
moved back in with them. I cannot 
justify that to Shambolain. I can- 
not justify consorting with his 
would-be killers. But I think he 
would understand. Like Shambo- 
lain, I cannot live alone. I cannot 
be by myself. That is merely the 
way of a human being, simply the 
weakness of a man. •

NICK O* TIME 

DONALD FRANSON 

If you had all the time in the 
world — could you hang on to it?

T o SAY that prospects were 
black for Nicholas Carver 
would be an exaggeration. At least 
he had a job and, though finances 
were still precarious, he found it 
easy to be cheerful. Just now his 
only real worry was keeping that 
job and he disclosed his solution 
to the other occupants of the 
“Second breakfast” table — the 
only time togetherness came close 
to working in this family. 

“I’m going to get me an alarm 
clock,” said Nick, counting his 
money. 

Aunt Lorraine said, “You could 
use mine, only it’s set for seven 
o‘clock and I don’t like to keep 
changing it.” 

“I’m getting my own, the wind- 
up kind. Electric ain’t no good, 
you know, if the power goes off.” 
“Ain’t never been late yet. Why 
you need an alarm clock anyhow, 
Nick? You goes to work at four 
P.M.” Lorraine Thompson 
couldn’t disguise the amused tol- 
erance of day-people for those 
who started late in the day and 
didn’t have to get up early. 

“I just want to make sure I get 
there in time,” said Nick. “I’m 
always doing something around 
the house and I don’t always no- 
tice what time it is. The other fel- 
lows were kidding me yesterday 
when they had to wait for me to 
show up.” 

Nick’s father put down the 
newspaper. “How you like your 
new job now, Nicholas?” 



“Oh, I don’t mind the work. It’s 
the waiting. When a car comes in, 
rush out and pump gas. Then noth- 
ing to do but wait. Not much busi- 
ness late at night.” 

“Don’t you have a radio?” 
asked Aunt Lorraine. 

“Get tired of radio. Can’t sleep 
either — that little ping-bell 
wouldn’t wake me. So I just sit 
there and watch for cars. Gets 
monotonous sometimes.” 

“All jobs are like that, son,” 
said Harry Carver, the voice of 
experience. “You’ll get a lot of 
that waiting when you get in the 
army.” 

Aunt Lorraine cleared the dishes 
and put them in the sink. “How 
about robberies, that late?” 

“I’m not worried,” said Nick. 
“They say just keep the cash box 
locked and don’t give them the key 
unless they get tough.” 

Aunt Lorraine frowned. “Can’t 
you get day shift? It’s a pain, all 
the different hours in this house. 
The kids to school by eight and 
you not home till after midnight.” 
“Two other guys on day shift. 
They’re the ones said I should get 
an alarm clock. And they’re right 
— I’m getting one today. Don’t 
want to lose this job.” 

“No, now that we got two 
working in the family,” said Aunt 
Lorraine, putting on her coat. 

Harry Carver said quickly, “I’ll 
get a job, don’t worry, as soon as 
there’s openings.” 

Aunt Lorraine smiled. “You

too touchy. I meant to say, two 
is a lot in this neighborhood. Bye 
now.” 

“You’re right,” said Mr. Car- 
ver, turning on the television. 

Nick left the house quietly. 

D IXON’S Discount Drugs was 
an oasis of plenty in a neigh- 
borhood of scarcity. They had 
everything at reasonable prices if 
you knew how to buy. There was 
merchandise that was inexpensive 
and there was merchandise that 
was cheap. Nick was an expert at 
telling the difference. 

He showed this by lingering a 
long time at the table where a 
number of alarm clocks were on 
display. He handled them all, then 
he handled them all twice, rejec- 
ting each for a different reason. 
Some were dented, some didn’t 
seem to work and others looked 
like they might not be reliable. The 
price was right but was the mer- 
chandise? 

Finally he decided that he would 
take a chance on one rather like 
the others except in color — they 
were silver gray and it was brown. 
It looked more sturdy and its ring 
seemed more melodious. Nick 
took it to the checkout counter 
and tendered his dollar ninety- 
eight. 

As soon as he reached home he 
unwrapped the package, sat at the 
kitchen table, oblivious to the tele- 
vision’s flickering and chatter and 
examined his purchase. Tamper- 



ing with machinery was a fascina- 
ting business to Nick and he bare- 
ly resisted the urge to take the 
clock apart. He set the time by 
Aunt Lorraine’s bedroom electric 
— ^just noon — then proceeded to 
examine the front and back of the 
clock. 

Nick’s father turned off the tele- 
vision, put on his coat and hat and 
announced, “I’m off to the unem- 
ployment agency.” 

“Have a good time,” said Nick, 
not looking up. He heard the door 
slam. Nick was alone. He turned 
his attention to the clock again. 

Paradox Clock Company — he 
had never heard of it. The usual 
levers and buttons were on the 
back of the clock. None were ad- 
justable except “fast” and “slow.” 
He found a smalF screwdriver and 
poked at the slot, moving the lever 
slightly, conservatively, toward 
“fast.” He heard a whirring noise. 

Turning the clock over, he no- 
ticed the hands were moving. What 
was going on? As he watched, the 
hour hand moved from twelve to 
one, while the minute hand went 
all the way around. The effect was 
startling. He pushed the lever to- 
ward “slow.” Now he saw the 
hands weren’t moving at all. He 
couldn’t be sure, of course, as he 
couldn’t normally see a clock’s 
hands moving anyway, but he felt 
the clock had almost stopped. 
What a sensitive lever, he thought, 
smiling. He would have to adjust 
it very carefully- 



186 



IF 




He poked the lever to make it 
go fast again. It was fun to wa4ch 
the hands go around and around. 
Now it was after three, by the 
clock, almost time to go to work. 
Quickly he stopped it. Now he 
would have to set it right again. 

Aunt Lorraine’s electric clock’s 
hands stood almost at quarter to 
four. His new clock and the elec- 
tric registered almost exactly the 
same time. Either both were wrong 
or he must have been dozing. 

As if to prove the latter theory 
his father came home. “You still 
working on that clock?’’ 

Nick felt in a daze. “What time 
is it?” 

Mr. Carver reached in his coat 
pocket and pulled out a golf 
watch, consulted it. “It’s about — 
three forty-two, give or take ten 
minutes. Hey, you getter get going 
— don’t want to be late again.” 
Nick threw on his jacket, 
grabbed his lunch box and, as he 
went out, snatched up the clock 
and jammed it into his pocket. 
He’d fix it when he got to work — 
and he didn’t want to leave it 
around for the kids to fool with 
when they came home. Walking 
fast, Nick hurried to the gas sta- 
tion. He wouldn’t be late this time, 
though no thanks to the new alarm 
clock. 

H IS two fellow workers greeted 
him cheerfully. Bill was al- 
ready in his car and Chester was 
leaning against the pump. He 



jumped up in mock surprise when 
he saw Nick. 

“Hey, you’re on time,” he said. 
“Did you get an alarm clock?” 

Nick pulled it out of his pock- 
et and showed them. They all 
laughed, Nick as much as the oth- 
ers. 

Bill said, “How come you bring 
it to work, Nick? Want to wake 
yourself up at quitting time?” 

Nick said, “No, I got to fix this 
clock. I just bought it, you know, 
and it needs adjusting.” 

“Better get it fixed by tomor- 
row,” laughed Chester, as they 
drove off 

Nick was busy for a few hours 
and didn’t think of the clock. He 
repaired the tire Bill and Chester 
had left him and he greased two 
cars, but most of the time he was 
pumping gas. This was a busy 
time, though not the busiest time 
of the day. Nick felt proud to be 
a part of a flourishing business. 
The gas station was an old-style 
one, with a single line of pumps, 
but it was adequate for the needs 
of the neighborhood. When Nick 
rushed out, his cheery greeting of 
“Fill her up?” was as often as not 
countered with a laconic, “Five, 
regular.” Nevertheless, the cash 
box did an open-and-shut business 
all that evening until along about 
seven, when Nick thought about 
lunch, or supper. 

While he was eating lunch in the 
station building (and watching for 
customers) he picked up the clock 



NICKO'TIAAE 



187 




he had left on the table. What was 
wrong with it anyway? He had nev- 
er heard of a clock so sensitive 
that when you set it fast it raced, 
and when you set it slow — He 
hadn’t really tested its slowness, 
yet. 

He picked up a cotter pin, poked 
at the lever, set it all the way to 
“slow.” Then he held the clock for 
a minute, seeing if the hands 
moved. It got awful quiet all of a 
sudden, he thought. Just the tick- 
ing of the clock. 

He went on eating his lunch 
while holding the clock. It didn’t 
move, showed ten after seven for 
a long time. It had obviously not 
stopped. It was still ticking away 
at the regular rate and the ticking 
seemed louder than ever. He 
glanced out. Things had quieted 
down now. Not a moving car was 
in sight, though he saw one parked 
in the middle of the street. He 
guessed the clock was all right, so 
he pushed the lever back to the 
center — he hoped it was in the 
right place; it seemed to settle 
there with a click — and checked 
the station clock, to see how much 
time had been lost. 

None had. The station clock 
iold the same time as his alarm 
clock. He put it down and went 
back to work, muttering to him- 
self. 

As he worked, washing down 
the apron, he felt uncertain,, be- 
wildered. How could the clock 
stop and then catch up, so that it 



didn’t lose time? And if it didn’t 
really stop, how did he manage to 
finish his lunch in no time at all? 

Was there something mysterious 
about the clock? Was it only a 
bargain clock, not worth the ef- 
fort to throw it on the junk pile, 
or was it more than he’d bargained 
for? 

When he had time to spare he 
studied the clock again. Somehow 
he didn’t dare take it apart. If it 
had strange powers he wouldn’t 
improve them by interfering. But 
what w;ere its mysterious powers? 
Could it really stop time and also, 
judging by his experience that af- 
ternooni speed up time? 

He sighed, shook his head and 
wound the clock again. It didn’t 
need much winding. He fixed up a 
cotter pin and attached it so that 
he could set the lever without hav- 
ing to poke at it. He stopped to 
answer the bell for a car pulling 
in and, after serving the customer, 
went back to the building. He 
wished he had time to think — he’d 
solve this yet. 

Wished he had time? 

Nick grinned, turned the pin- 
and-lever to “slow.” Then he 
sighed with satisfaction, leaned 
back in the hard chair and hugged 
the clock to him. 

He found out a lot about the 
clock in the next two minutes — 
which seemed like an hour — and 
the following hour — which seemed 
like two minutes. He found the 
effects only worked properly, with- 



188 



IF 




out impeding his movement, if he 
held on to the clock with his hands 
or touched it in some way. Time 
flies, or stands still — but only if 
you hold on tight can you take ad- 
vantage of it. 

Once again he watched the hands 
go around, though not as fast as 
previously. This was the way to 
make time go by, when your job 
was boring. It was nearly dark 
outside now — and suddenly he no- 
ticed two cars in the driveway. 
They hadn’t been there a moment 
ago. 

He turned the lever back to 
normal, put the clock down and 
rushed out. One of the cars was 
just pulling away. He greeted the 
other man apprehensively. “Fill 
it up with premium?’’ he asked, as 
the car moved up into the other’s 
place. 

The man looked at Nick with 
disapproval. “Looks like you lost 
a customer there. I’d have gone, 
too, but I need gas — five, regular. 
Say, what’s eating you? You was 
there in plain sight, grinning like 
an idiot. If you was asleep, it 
wouldn’t have looked so bad.’’ 

Nick apologized. 

“Five, one forty. Sure sorry I 
kept you waiting.’’ 

Nick, back in the building, 
turned on the lights. Night was 
coming on fast. He’d have to be 
more careful with the clock. It was 
a very valuable thing to have. He 
was not going to take it back to 
the store now, no matter what. 



He pondered the problem, off 
and on, all evening. Suddenly he 
had the explanation to the mys- 
tery. It was in the color of the 
clock. 

All the other clocks on the table 
at Dixon’s were silver gray. Only 
this one was brown. Army brown. 
Olive drab, they called it. 

This was a military clock that 
had somehow got mixed in with 
the shipment from the factory, the 
Paradox Clock Company. This 
was an Army clock with secret fea- 
tures, secret inventions like speed- 
ing up time or slowing it down for 
military purposes. It was disguised 
as an ordinary alarm clock. Why 
would they use alarm clocks in 
the Army when they had bugles 
and sergeants’ whistles? Well, he 
supposed officers had them. They’d* 
know about this secret feature. 
Seems he’d heard of scientists 
slowing down time, and speeding 
it up, before. Nothing he wouldn’t 
put past these military scientists. 

So what was he going to do with 
the clock? He had got it, fair and 
square, by mistake. Was he going 
to turn it back in to the Army? 
You bet your sweet life he wasn’t. 
He’d be put in jail, just for know- 
ing the secret. If they didn’t even 
know the clock was lost, he wasn’t 
going to tell them it was found. 
One clock more or less wouldn’t 
mean much to the government. 

On the other hand, this was an 
important secret. He was not 
going to let anybody know about 



NICKO'TIME 



189 




it who wasn’t supposed to know. 
Couldn’t be giving military secrets 
away to unauthorized persons. 
No, sir! 

He’d have to be careful. Take 
the pin out when he wasn’t using 
it. 

He guessed there could be mili- 
tary uses for the clock — but what 
about civilian uses? How many 
times had he wanted to compress 
time — or expand time? Of course 
he realized he would live the same 
time inside, whether he speeded 
up or slowed down time outside. 
Things would even out if he used 
the clock wisely. He wouldn’t be 
losing anything — ^just exchanging 
the boring hours for the good 
hours, play time, sleep time. Even 
study time — think what he could 
learn while he stopped the clock. 

He supposed other people 
wouldn’t use the clock wisely — but 
he wasn’t going to misuse it. He 
looked at it with a new respect. He 
started to take out the pin, then 
he put the clock down as a car 
pulled up. It was nearly eleven 
o‘clock now, what with all his 
time experiments. There weren’t 
many cars at this hour and he 
could go home at midnight. 



T he car was a new Imperial. 

Two men were in it. One, 
husky and tall, got out of the car. 
He seemed nervous. 

“Fill it, premium?’’ Nick asked. 
“Yeah,’’ said the husky man. 



He leaned on the car window and 
talked in low tones to the other 
man, whose lean face was tense. 
As Nick finished checking the oil 
and came around with the cloth the 
husky man said, “Never mind the 
windows.’’ 

The lean-faced man muttered, 
“We can use some change, too.’’ 

“Yeah,’’ said the man standing 
outside. “Can’t pass that stuff.’’ 

Nick, after taking away the hose 
and checking the pump, an- 
nounced, “Thirteen and six-tenths. 
That’ll be five thirty-five. Cash or 
credit?’’ 

The husky man said, “We pre- 
fer cash. Open that box.’’ He pro- 
duced a gun. 

Nick sidled away. “The key’s 
inside. I’ll get it.” He started at 
a run for the building. 

“No you don’t,” said the rob- 
ber, coming around the car. He 
pointed the gun at Nick and fired 
a quick shot, missing, then fol- 
lowed quickly, almost catching up 
to Nick. 

Nick dodged, kicked out with 
one foot, tripping the man. He 
dove into the station building, 
scrambled to the table inside. He 
knew what he was after. 

The man was still on the ground 
but had his gun up again to shoot 
through the doorway. 

Nick grabbed at the clock on 
the table, pushed the pin and turned 
around. The man outside had be- 
come motionless, sprawled awk- 
wardly on the cement, elbow and 



190 



IF 




arm up, pointing his gun toward 
Nick. He seemed to move percep- 
tibly, and Nick pushed the pin on 
the clock as tight as he could. He 
knew, however, that he couldn’t 
stop time completely. He had not 
a monwnt to waste. 

He had had no clear idea of 
what to do when he had rushed in 
here except, maybe, to gain time 
to call for help. But how could he 
call for help when everybody else 
would be as motionless as the rob- 
bers? 

He picked up the phone with his 
right hand (the clock was in his 
left) and fingered the dial. It turned 
very stiffly. This wasn’t going to 
work, he thought. He knew as 
much when he saw the dial was not 
springing back. He had pulled it 
all the way around from “opera- 
tor” and it stuck there at the end. 
He laid the phone down on the 
table, looked out at the driveway. 

The lean-faced man in the car 
hadn’t moved, was still sitting 
there. The other man was lying 
just outside the doorway, point- 
ing the gun in the general direction 
of Nick. Nothing moved — but 
then, nothing much moved at this 
time of night anyway. 

Nick had no gun. He didn’t 
think it would be a good idea to 
wrestle the man for his own gun, 
or try to step over him, because 
he felt that if he touched the other, 
he, too, would come alive and 
Nick would be no match for him 
in a fight. He had to dispose of 



both men while the tin^less spell 
was upon them — that was the only 
advantage he had. He could ex- 
pect no help from outside. If he 
held on to the clock while he struck 
the men with a wrench or some- 
thing it might work, but then 
again it might not. And if they 
took the clock away from him — 
what couldn’t criminals do with 
this invention? 

He tried to keep out of line 
with the pointing gun as he 
searched for something to throw. 
He held on to the clock with his 
left hand, pawed frantically about 
the shelves with his right. Nothing 
suited until he came upon some 
boxes of spark plugs. They were 
knockout weapons in the hands 
of a good thrower. 

Carefully, for he knew that he 
must knock both men before he 
could let time come back, he sight- 
ed and threw. A dozen spark plugs 
in all he pulled out of their boxes, 
which drifted away as he emptied 
them. He threw slowly and delith 
erately. He put no speed on his 
pitches — he knew speed could be 
added later. 

He saw that the man on the 
ground was still pointing his pis- 
tol at him. He saw it flame and 
saw a bullet float toward him, 
bounce off the clock he was still 
holding in his left hand. His wrist 
thumped him in the chest and sud- 
denly everything changed. The 
world came to life, noises rushed 
at him — the breaking of glass, the 



NICKO'TIAAE 



191 




echo of a shot, the crashing of 
ricocheting missiles. 

Then he heard the whirr of the 
phone dial and a voice that said, 
“Operator.” 

Nick dazedly picked up the 
phone, and said, “Give me the po- 
lice. They’s robbing the gas sta- 
tion at Ninth and Castle.” He 
looked out at the silent figures 
on the ground and in the car. 
“That is, they was robbing it.” 

N ick saw his father in the 
crowd and waved to him. His 
father came to grasp his hand 
warmly. “Glad to see you’re all 
right, Nicholas. We heard the 
shots and sirens and I thought I’d 
better come and see what’s hap- 
pening over here.” 

A policeman came over with a 
notebook, spoke to Nick. “Well, 
Mr. Carver, you’ve some more 
credit coming to you. It’s a stolen 
car recovery, too.” He turned to 
the older Carver. “This your son? 
He’s done a fine job, ^aved us a lot 
of trouble with those two jewel 
thieves. Those men were killers. 
But I’m afraid he’s in a little 



trouble, too. He won’t say what 
he did with the spring-gun he had.” 
Harry Carver said, “He didn’t 
have no spring-gun. He’s a law- 
abiding citizen.” 

“Well, it’s a cinch he didn’t 
throw those spark plugs,” said the 
policeman. “Drilled them clean. 
One made a big hole in the car.” 
“He’s never been in trouble, nev- 
er. He’s a good boy.” 

“Well, all right,” said the of- 
ficer. “But I’ll have to put it in 
my report, and there might be 
questions, later. Anyway, you’ve 
done us a favor and we appreciate 
it. But, get rid of that spring-gun, 
will you?” 

His father said, “What happened 
to that alarm clock?” Nick no- 
ticed it was still in his left hand, 
battered into shapelessness. 

“Looks like it was hit by a bul- 
let,” said the policeman. 

Nick said, “It’s junk now — ” 
and tossed it into a nearby trash 
container. A safe disposal, in full 
view of the authorities. He sighed. 
Perhaps the clock saved his life. 
Bullets were still pretty fast — even 
in slow motion. •
