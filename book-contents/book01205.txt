Charles Sheffield 



This is really rather nasty. 
Why did you let it go so long with- 
out attention? You should have 
come in for treatment weeks ago.” 

The dentist who was working on 
my ripely abscessed upper molar 
had a habit, common to his profes- 
sion, of trying to conduct a conver- 
sation with a patient whose mouth 
was wedged open like a yawning 
hippopotamus. An accurate answer 
to his question would take twenty 
minutes and involve — at a min- 
imum — mushrooms, space warps, 
high finance, aliens, the asteroid 
belt and my personal reputation. I 
rolled my eyes and said “Aa-gn- 
hng-aa,” or words to the effect. 
The answer seemed to satisfy him 
and he turned the conversation to 
local politics. 

It really isn’t easy to know where 
to begin. With the aliens? Accord- 
ing to common myth, it isn’t really 
possible to hate an alien. If and 
when we meet up with some, the 
argument goes, we should get on 
with them very well. Our hatred is 
reserved for our own kind. I happen 
to know that idea is wrong. No 
human has ever met a Kaneelian, 
we don’t know where or how they 
live, or even what size and shape 
they are. But they cost me a million 
credits, they gave me the worst 
three days of my life, and they may 
make the name ‘Henry Carver’ go 
down in history as a big joke. I 
have a strong and personal hatred of 
Kaneelians, the whole wretched 
species. 

A CERTAIN PLACE IN HISTORY 



That’s obviously the wrong place 
to begin. I get carried away. Let me 
begin, objectively, with the tooth. 

It was a left upper molar that had 
been filled a couple of times al- 
ready, and it was beginning to give 
me trouble again. Two hundred 
years ago, in the bad old days be- 
fore medical science was perfected, 
a tooth was pulled out when it gave 
trouble. It is now possible, thanks 
to partially effective nerve-regener- 
ation techniques, for the same tooth 
to cause periodic anguish for a good 
fifty years, with enormous as- 
sociated cost. The ache was getting 
bad enough for me to consider and 
put off a visit to the dentist when I 
had a videophone call from Izzy 
Roberson. 

Izzy was always worth talking to. 
An old friend of my partner, Waldo 
Burmeister, he had suggested some 
profitable deals for us in the past, 
and wasn’t a man to waste your 
time with small stuff. 

‘‘Got something good for you, 
Henry,” Izzy’s cheerful image be- 
gan. ‘‘Know what agaricus campes- 
tris is?” He was a tiny, bouncy 
man, hopping up and down as usual 
in front of the screen. He had a 
great fondness for tall women, who 
loomed high above him and always 
made me think of the old story of 
the midget and the showgirl. 

I groped vaguely after law-school 
Latin. ‘‘Campestris. Something-or- 
other of the fields?’ ’ 

‘‘Not bad, Henry, not bad at all. 
Agaricus campestris — it’s mush- 

5 




rooms, meadow mushrooms. Hold 
on a second, I’m going to put the 
scrambler on.” 

The screen became random color 
for a second, then cleared again as 
the unit on my phone picked up the 
coded unscrambler. 

“Safe to talk now,” he went on. 
“Henry, we want you to be a front 
man. We’re all set to develop a 
mushroom monopoly. If we pull 
this off, you’ll get all the commis- 
sions.” 

A mushroom monopoly sounded 
about as valuable as a comer in 
yak-wool hats. Cut off the supply of 
meadow mushrooms, and it seemed 
to me that people would happily eat 
something else. I mentioned this to 
Izzy. 

“Henry, don’t you ever look at 
the science sections? They don’t 
grow the damn things for eating, 
they use them to extract the trans- 
plant catalysts. There are only three 
companies in the business, and my 
clients now control two of them. 
We want the third, but we have to 
work through an intermediary.” 

I understood that easily enough. 
Laws on monopolies were getting 
stricter all the time. It was a situa- 
tion I’d been involved in before and 
I knew the main limiting factors. 

“How much of the stock do you 
need, Izzy? Where’s it traded, and 
what do I use for money?” 

“It trades right here, on the 
Tycho City Board. If we can get 
twenty-seven percent of the voting 
stock, we’ll have clear control. We 



already bought eight percent 
through a holding company and 
we’ve been promised votes on 
another eleven percent on a trade- 
for-favors base. We want you to get 
the other eighf percent any way you 
can.” 

“Expenses?” 

“Sure. But you only get the 
commissions if you buy us all we 
need. Finish with seven percent and 
you get nothing. Here are the credit 
number and stockholder positions 
you’ll need to do the buying.” 

I pressed ‘Record’ and he flashed 
me a stock I.D. list and a fourteen- 
digit code on the Tycho City Cen- 
tral Bank. 

“One other thing, Henry. We’ve 
got a deadline. Midnight, U.T., 
twelve days from now. Think you 
can make it?” 

It would be tight, maybe, but it 
should be possible. I thought for a 
moment, then nodded just as the 
door behind Izzy opened and a tall 
blonde walked in. He glanced 
around, waved a quick farewell to 
me and cut the connection on the 
tableau of Snow White and Happy. 
I was glad to see him go so I could 
get started at once. I forgot my 
nagging tooth and began to check 
the stock prices. 

If you’ve ever been involved in a 
quiet stock purchase, you know 
there are two main factors: A low 
profile, and fast action. If people 
think there is a take-over in the 
wind, they get greedy and hold on to 
what they have. Hie last percent

GALAXY 




always costs the most. And if you 
don’t do it fast enough, the profes- 
sional market analysts will move 
when they see a lot of quick trans- 
actions in a quiet stock, and start 
buying against you on a speculative 
basis. 

After eight days, I had things 
moving along nicely. Six percent of 
the stock I needed was committed 
to a forward buy, held for three 
days, and I was expecting a call or 
a visit on the remaining two per- 
cent. 1 sat in my Tycho City apart- 
ment, one ear tuned to the phone 
and the other to the door chime. 
Visions of sugarplums danced in 
my head, and when the door rang, I 
leaped to answer it. 

I’ve become used to some un- 
usual intermediaries in financial 
deals, but the man who ducked his 
head in through the doorway was 
the strangest yet. Huge, straw- 
haired, jutting-jawed, steely eyed 
— you can supply the other ad- 
jectives yourself. It added up to the 
cliche hero of a space opera. He 
came in, looked at me, past me, 
and around the apartment. Finally 
he shrugged slightly and looked at 
me again. 

“Henry Carver?’’ There was sur- 
prise in his voice. 

“Yes. You’re from Securities In- 
vestment?’’ 

He made himself at home on my 
couch. “Never heard of them. 
Look, let me make sure there’s no 
mistake. Are you Henry Carver, the 
man who worked with Gerald Mat- 



tin on the development of the Mat- 
tin Link?” 

Hospitality and politeness have 
their limits. Anyway, that episode 
with the Mattin Link is not one of 
my favorite memories. “I don’t 
know who you are, or what you’re 
doing here. But I have an important 
business visit due any minute now. 
If you are not from Securities In- 
vestment, I’m afraid I must ask you 
to leave at once.” 

“Sorry, Mr. Carver. I can’t do 
that.” He fished in his coverall 
pocket and pulled out a mag strip 
I.D. “Check that out, then let’s 
talk.” 

He was depressingly sure of him- 
self. I fed the strip through the 
phone connection and watched the 
I.D. appear on the screen: Imre 
Munsen, Special Investigator, 
United Space Federation; authorized 
to commandeer the use of equip- 
ment, services and personnel for 
Level Four System Emergencies; 
classification of current assignment 
(you’ve guessed it): Level Four. 

“Now you know who I am, Mr. 
Carver. Before we go on, I have to 
be sure that I know who you are. 
Are you in fact the man who 
worked on the original Mattin 
Link — the man who survived those 
first experiments?” 

“I am, but that was a long time 
ago. I don’t know anything about 
the Links they have nowadays.” 

“That’s all right. We need help 
from someone with a fresh mind, 
not tied to current theory. First, I 



A CERTAIN PLACE IN HISTORY

must swear you to strictest secrecy. 
A situation of unprecedented danger 
to the human race has arisen. If you 
reveal what 1 tell you to a third 
party, you will be guilty of endan- 
gering the public welfare and will 
be charged accordingly. You know 
the penalties.” 

I did indeed. Anything the court 
chose to inflict. It was rather like 
the old military courts -martial. No 
appeals, and the prosecutors, jury 
and judge were all the same people. 
My stomach began a rumble of an- 
ticipatory fear. 

“Mr. Carver,” Munsen went on, 
“it will be simplest if you listen to 
me first without asking questions. I 
have studied your file, so I know 
your capability and pattern of rapid 
response. But hear me out, please, 
before you begin.” 

What was the man talking about? 
I wondered what was in the file. 
And what about my business ap- 
pointment? Munsen had better get 
on with it and go away quickly. 
There were a million credits waiting 
for me — if 1 could conclude my 
mushroom stock purchases in time. 
I decided to let him have his say, 
then tell him at once that I couldn’t 
help. 

Ifs best if I summarize what he 
said to me. Munsen was just the 
sort of starry-eyed, deep-chested 
idiot he looked. Patriotic, fearless, 
decisive, clean-living — we seemed 
to have absolutely nothing in com- 
mon, the two of us. His explanation 
was full of irrelevant stirring 



speeches about our future, and the 
need for all of us to give our utmost 
to human advancement. It was 
enough to make a rational man sick. 

Six weeks earlier, as Munsen told 
it, a party of six had chartered a 
space yacht for a scenic tour of the 
inner Solar System. Milton 
Kaneely, the holovision star, had 
made the rental. Three men and 
three women were on board — and 
with Milton Kaneely, for ‘scenic 
tour’ you could safely read ‘drunken 
orgy.’ They had careened randomly 
around the Moon and off past Mars 
into the asteroid belt. Blundering 
along there, they had landed on a 
rock fragment less than a kilometer 
long — and stumbled across the first 
evidence of an alien race. On the 
asteroid, in a big rock chamber, sat 
the space warp. Kaneely and friends 
didn’t know it was a space warp — 
or even that they had found evi- 
dence of aliens. They thought 
they’d found an unmanned USF 
Navy station. They sent a joking 
message back to Tycho City, com- 
plaining about the lack of a station 
emergency grog supply, and rock- 
eted off for Chryse City. 

The USF Communications Group 
would have written the call off as a 
joke, except that on the way to 
Chryse City the Kaneely party had 
encountered another asteroid — this 
time at a relative velocity of five 
kilometers a second. The accident, 
so far as anyone could tell, had noth- 
ing to do with their earlier land- 
ing, but the investigation group had 



8 



GALAXY 




taken a look at that asteroid too, to 
make their report complete. They 
found the space warp. Not knowing 
quite what it was, they were still 
smart enough to recognize it as an 
alien artifact. That was when Imre 
Munsen had been called in. 

“The most irritating thing,” he 
said to me, “is the complete ran- 
domness of it. The Kaneelians didn’t 
try to hide the space warp from 
us, but they didn’t give it any kind 
of beacon, either. For all the help 
we had from them, it could have 
been another thousand years before 
we stumbled across it. We still have 
no idea how long they were on that 
asteroid, what they were doing in 
the Solar System, or when they left. 
They might come back any time.” 

He looked gloomy and irritated. I 
stole a glance at my watch. It was 
getting late, my tooth was aching 
again, and there was still no sign of 
my mushroom man. 

“This whole matter is really in- 
teresting, Mr. Munsen,” I said to 
him, polite and insincere. “But I’m 
a lawyer, you know, not a scientist. 
1 can’t think why you want me in- 
volved in all this — unless you are 
planning to sue the aliens for negli- 
gence.” 

He cheered up a little and smiled 
at me. “You underrate yourself, 
Mr. Carver. I like to see that in a 
man. Our computer selected your 
file from millions, as the best per- 
son we could get for this job. I read 
your background myself before I 
came here, and I won’t be fooled 



by a modest appearance. The first 
man to transfer through the Mattin 
Link — and the only survivor of 
those early experiments. The man to 
whom Peter Pinton entrusted the se- 
cret of Pintonite, and one of two 
men to come out of that alive when 
Pinton was killed.” 

Munsen shook his head admir- 
ingly. “It’s not just a question of 
hard work and intelligence, Mr. 
Carver. Lots of people have those. 
You also have good • luck — and 
you’ve got guts.” 

Not only that, I fully intended to 
keep them. I had no idea where 
Munsen had got all that in- 
formation — accurate, as far as it 
went, but it didn’t go far enough. I 
felt like saying, “No, no, you’ve 
got it all wrong. I’m not brave at 
all. I’m a certified coward.” But I 
didn’t think it would make any dif- 
ference. Munsen looked like a very 
determined man. Instead, I said, “I 
only wish I could help you, Mr. 
Munsen. But really I have no idea 
what I could do for you. I have 
pressing business obligations, and I 
know nothing about the aliens.” 
“You know as much as we do, 
Mr. Carver. I want you to take a 
look at that space warp and use 
your intuition and experience.” 

My intuition and experience told 
me to stay as far away from it as I 
could. 

“It has our group baffled,” Mun- 
sen went on. “It provides instan- 
taneous transfer, the same as the 
Mattin Link, but it’s a lot more

flexible. For one thing, it seems as 
though the exit points can be any- 
where. For another, you don’t need 
Link equipment at the exit. We’ve 
been able to send signalling 
devices — not people — through it, 
and they come out some place in 
the Solar System. Some random 
place. Two disappeared, and we 
think they must have gone into the 
Sun.” 

Worse and worse. So far, it 
sounded riskier than the Mattin 
Link, and I’d had my fill of that 
long ago. ‘‘You tried to send 
people?” I asked. 

He nodded. ‘‘Volunteers. But 
there’s some kind of a sensing de- 
vice on the side of the warp 
chamber. It won’t send living 
multi-celled organisms. Just sits 
there humming when we try it. It’s 
very disappointing. The Kaneelians 
built in some kind of control on it 
and we have no idea how to change 
the settings.” 

‘‘Why not take it apart?” 

‘‘We’d love to. As soon as we 
know how it works, we will. At the 
moment we’re afraid we may ruin it 
completely if we tamper with it. 
We’d like to study the separate 
pieces. For one thing, it seems as 
though there are all-temperature 
superconductors in the control 
box.” 

What was an all -temperature 
superconductor? I shook my head 
firmly. ‘‘There’s not a thing I could 
do for you, Mr. Munsen. It’s out- 
side my field.” 



Munsen turned three moods 
meaner. ‘‘Mr. Carver, I don’t think 
you understand the situation. I am 
requesting your cooperation. But I 
am not really offering you a choice. 
We need you. If you persist in your 
attitude, I will be forced to send 
you for a hearing — on Earth.” He 
smiled a horrid smile. ‘‘Your record 
suggests that you prefer not to visit 
Earth. In any case, I expected you 
would welcome a chance to serve 
humanity.” 

A hearing on Earth. I shuddered 
at the thought. There were people 
there who’d love to get their hands 
on me. Whatever Munsen’s project, 
I couldn’t imagine it would be 
worse than that. Even so, I wasn’t 
prepared to give up my million 
credits without a struggle. 

‘‘Don’t get me wrong, Mr. 
Munsen. I’d be only too happy to go 
with you and take a look at the 
alien machines. But I have big re- 
sponsibilities here. I can’t spare the 
time, particularly just now.” 

His manner warmed a little. ‘‘Of 
course, I know you’re a busy man. 
What I have in mind wouldn’t take 
long. I want you to take a quick 
look at the alien equipment, then 
you can come back here to the 
Moon and think it over, see what 
ideas it suggests to you. If neces- 
sary, we’ll arrange a second trip 
later — but that might not be needed, 
if we can use your ideas without 
your presence.” 

‘‘But can’t that first trip wait a 
week?” 



10 



GALAXY 




He shook his head. “I’m afraid 
not. Time is important. Every day 
wasted could mean danger to us all. 
Until we understand the space warp, 
we won’t feel safe — the Kaneelians 
could come back any day, and we’d 
be helpless. I will guarantee you 
that if we leave tonight. I’ll have 
you back from this trip in forty- 
eight hours. That’s the best I can 
offer, and I tell you that I’m stretch- 
ing the rules to promise that.’’ 

Two days away would leave only 
two more days to finish the stock 
deal. I didn’t like it at all, but I 
sensed that it was the best offer I’d 
get. For a Level Four emergency 
like this one, Munsen could have 
me shot, and no one would ask him 
for the reason until it was too late. 

“Give me the time to make one 
videophone call,” I said. “Then I’ll 
be ready to go. What do I need to 
bring with me?” 

“Not a thing — we’ll fit you out 
at Headquarters.” He looked 
pleased with himself, and what he 
probably thought of as his subtle 
powers of persuasion. “I must say. 
Carver, I’m feeling relieved to 
know you’ll be working on this 
job.” 

I postponed my mushroom meet- 
ing for two days — much to my con- 
tact’s surprise, who knew something 
tricky was going on financially. 
Timing on these deals is everything. 
Then I swallowed a pill for my ach- 
ing tooth, and off we went. It made 
me very pessimistic for the future of 
humanity, to think that they had to 




rely on people like me to handle 
their emergencies. 

Two hours later we lifted away 
from Tycho Base on a high-speed 
USF Navy cutter. Free fall never 
did agree with me, and never will. I 
was all right during the eight-hour 
trip to Kaneely’s asteroid, a forlorn 
chip of rock in the middle of 
nowhere, because the ship was 
under acceleration all the way. But 
the temporary station that the Navy 
had set up on the rock itself had no 
gravity to speak of. 

We didn’t bother to dock in the 
usual way — there was only a big 
pressure dome, on the surface of the 
asteroid. We hovered close to that. 



A CERTAIN PLACE IN HISTORY

and went across to it in our suits. 
Inside the bubble about forty men 
and women had assembled. Mun- 
sen, like the ham he was, made a 
fool of both of us. 

He made a stand-up speech. 
“Men,” he said — ignoring the 
women completely. “We’ve had a 
hard time of it, this last month. 
Now there’s a ray of hope, a light 
at the end of the tunnel. Here is the 
man we’ve all waited to see, Henry 
Carver. Henry Carver, the only 
man — .” And away he went. 

I endured it, averting my eyes 
from the audience, which seemed 
to be lapping it up. After Munsen 
dried up, they went into a very long 
and — to me, at any rate — com- 
pletely meaningless briefing on the 
work that had been done so far to 
explore the Kaneelian chamber in 
the rock. I nodded occasionally, but 
the technical discussion was beyond 
me. 

Boiling off the jargon and gib- 
berish, what was left seemed to be 
simple enough. The asteroid 
chamber was completely empty ex- 
cept for the space warp, and nobody 
had any idea at all how that 
worked. 

You put a signalling beacon, or 
some other object, inside it and then 
pressed a bar on the outside. In- 
stantly, the beacon or whatever ap- 
peared somewhere else, anywhere 
from ten thousand to five hundred 
million miles away. The beacons 
that had been recovered — they had 
lost another since Munsen briefed 



me — were all intact and apparently 
unscathed by the jump. But their 
positions when they appeared were 
completely random. Put a man or 
an animal inside the warp cylinder, 
and press the bar again. Nothing at 
all happened, except a slight hum 
from the machine. 

They had tried men in twos and 
men in threes; men in lead suits to 
screen testing radiation; men in sus- 
pended animation; men who had 
been knocked unconscious; and — 
Munsen would try anything — dead 
men. Of these, only the last were 
accepted for transfer and as usual 
they told no tales. 

The Navy still had plenty of vol- 
unteers, going dutifully into the 
space- warp enclosure and then, 
hours later, floating back out again 
when it was clear that nothing was 
going to happen. There was no 
doubt that they were all getting dis- 
couraged. 

I wasn’t keen to go near the 
Kaneelian machine — you never knew 
when it might suddenly decide to 
work, explode or otherwise do 
something drastic. On the other 
hand, I very much wanted to get the 
thing over with and go back to 
Tycho City for my unfinished busi- 
ness. When the briefing ended, 
Munsen and I floated together down 
into the big chamber under the 
surface of the asteroid. 

It was actually three big spaces, 
inter-connected through tall arch- 
ways. Two were completely empty 
and in a comer of the third sat a 



12 



GALAXY 




solitary, dull-grey metal cylinder, 
about two meters wide and three 
meters high. The space warp. You 
climbed in through the open top, 
and on the outside there was a gray 
bar that activated the system — or 
failed to if there was a man inside. 

“Why are the arches so big?” I 
asked Imre Munsen over my suit 
radio. “Were the Kaneelians all ten 
meters tall?” 

“We don’t know. They might 
have been. On the other hand, they 
should have been our size, or near 
to it, to fit into the warp. For all we 
know now, they may cdhie in a vari- 
ety of sizes. Why do you ask?” 

A good question. I was just mak- 
ing conversation to put off the next 
step. Then I had an idea. “You say 
it will send single-celled animals 
through. Is it possible that the 
Kaneelians were single-celled? 
Could a single cell grow to the size 
of a man?” 

“I don’t see why not. It wouldn’t 
solve our problem. It would explain 
why a single-celled animal can get 
through — but not why multi-celled 
animals can’t. Why would they 
want to stop a transfer?” 

I shrugged. Since I don’t under- 
stand human behavior at all, it 
seemed presumptuous to guess at 
the motives of the aliens. Munsen 
gestured at the top of the warp cyl- 
inder. 

“I’m going to take a look at the 
inside, Henry. Coming?” 

“Best if I stay outside, I think,” 

I said casually. “The control unit’s 



out here. I want to watch what hap- 
pens to it when you go inside.” 

Munsen had made it quite clear 
that at some point he expected me 
to take a look inside that ghastly 
cylinder, but I saw no reason to rush 
in. He nodded at me. “Makes 
sense. Once I’m inside, press the 
bar. You never know, I might get 
lucky.” 

He floated up, then down into the 
open top of the cylinder. After a 
couple of seconds, his voice came 
over the suit radio. I worked the 
bar, and hoped. There was a low, 
steady humming from one of two 
square boxes on the side of the 
warp. It went on for about five sec- 
onds, then stopped. I waited. 

After twenty seconds I heard 
Munsen ’s disappointed voice. “No 
good. I might as well come out 
again. There’s a sort of metal piece 
inside here that moved backwards 
and forwards when I was waiting 
for the warp. I think it’s the scan- 
ner. Let’s change places and you 
can take a look.” 

It was the moment of truth. If 
one of the boxes contained the 
scanner control, then the other box 
was presumably the warp mech- 
anism itself. While Munsen was 
getting out of the cylinder, I took 
a multi-purpose belt attachment 
from the waist of my suit and 
opened up a long dur-steel spike. Its 
use had always mystified me — it 
looked like an ice pick, but presum- 
ably wasn’t. I drove it as hard as I 
could into the soft-plastic middle of 



A CERTAIN PLACE IN HISTORY 



13 




the box that I thought contained the 
warp mechanism. Then — a bad mis- 
take, as I later realized — to be on 
the safe side, I drove it just as hard 
into the other box. 

There was a satisfying sizzling 
noise, like ’a damp onion ring 
dropped into very hot fat. Feeling 
much reassured, I put the spike 
away and waited for Munsen to join 
me. 

“Let me stand here and watch 
what happens,” he said. “Did you 
see anything at this end when I was 
inside?” 

I shrugged, then realized he 
couldn’t see that well inside my 
suit. “Just the hum you told me 
about — from that box.” 

I hoped my efforts to gain a little 
insurance would not be visible to 
Munsen. With the old butterflies in 
my stomach, I pushed gently off 
from the floor, floated up and then, 
with a slight down-boost from the 
jets, dropped slowly into the warp 
cylinder. 

Despite my steps to deactivate 
the warp, I had the feeling that 1 
was in trouble: 1 think the thing that 
separates a real coward from ordinary 
men is an extra sense that provides 
him with a continuous stream of in- 
formation on all dangers, real or 
imaginary. To my eye, the open top 
of the cylinder gaped beneath me 
like the mouth of Hell. 

I touched the warp floor, and 
stood there breathless. After fifteen 
long seconds, when nothing at all 
had happened, 1 drew air into my 



complaining lungs. It felt good. 

“It’s no good, Munsen,” I said, 
hoping my relief didn’t show in my 
voice. “Nothing’s happening. 1 
might as well come out.” 

He didn’t answer. I straightened 
my legs to push off from the floor 
of the warp cylinder. They made no 
contact. I looked down, then up. In 
both directions, there was a feature- 
less gray nothingness — and it was 
the same on all sides. 

I was baffled. I couldn’t be in the 
warp transfer — that was instantane- 
ous. Then where was I? The ques- 
tion became more and more relevant 
as time went by and seconds be- 
came minutes. 

It would be misleading to say that 
I panicked when I realized the fix I 
was in. I had been in a state of ter- 
ror ever since Munsen made it 
clear that he expected me to go in- 
side the warp chamber. I couldn’t 
get much higher on the panic scale. 
Even so, I didn’t at all relish the 
prospect of starving to death inside 
my suit, or maybe popping out in- 
side the Sun. My water and air re- 
cycling were almost perfect, but I 
would run out of food in a week. 

After an hour of these cheerful 
thoughts, a new factor entered. My 
tooth erupted again. It had been sit- 
ting back, quietly throbbing, ever 
since we reached the asteroid. Now 
it woke up with a vengeance and 
began to poke red-hot needles down 
through the top of my head. I 
eouldn’t get a finger in my mouth 
because it was in the suit, but I ran 



14 



GALAXY 




my tongue over the left side of my 
inner gum and was rewarded with a 
bolt of lightning through my left 
temple. The gum felt squishy and I 
had a peculiar taste in my mouth. 
The pain grew steadily worse. 

There seems little point in a de- 
tailed recapitulation of the next 
three days. If — as seems un- 
likely — you’ve been through a 
similar experience, you know what 
it was like. If not, no words de- 
scribe it. Fortunately or unfortunate- 
ly, the infection from my tooth dis- 
torted my time sense. I ran a high 
fever and was delirious for at least 
part of the time. Teeth were much 
on my mind. I remember saying, 
out loud, ‘the tooth, and nothing 
but the tooth,’ and “uneasy lies the 
tooth that wears the crown.” 

One thing is clear. Somehow, the 
combination of solitude, fear, pain 
and fever worked a strange syn- 
thesis. Just after I had said, “But 
why put the warp controls on the 
outside, not the inside?” I under- 
stood, from nowhere, the purpose, 
logic and practice of the Kaneelian 
space warp. I knew why we 
couldn’t see a pattern in the points 
of exit, and why we hadn’t been 
able to send living things through it. 

The knowledge did me no good. 
My misery went on. Then, long 
after I had died, gone to Hell, and 
been sent on from there to a worse 
place, the gray ambience suddenly 
vanished and I popped out into the 
black, dazzling vacuum of normal 
space. My suit emergency signal 



switched itself on and four hours 
later a USF transfer vessel picked 
me up. I had been warped almost 
two million miles away from the as- 
teroid. The ship’s robodoc clucked 
over me and pumped me full of an- 
tibiotics, tranquilizers and happy 
pills. By the time We reached Tycho 
Base 1 was stoned out of my mind 
and feeling pretty good. 

The trip took twenty hours. When 
we finally got there, I saw from my 
watch that my mushroom-deal dead- 
line was a thing of the past. 
Goodbye million credits, I thought 
cheerfully. Hello Imre Munsen. 

He had arrived at Tycho shortly 
before I had. Would you believe it, 
he wanted to pump me for informa- 
tion before we’d exchanged two 
words? He was in a fine state of 
excitement. 

“Henry, you did it! We knew 
you would. What was the trick to 
it? How did you know what to 
do?” 

I had a clear choice. I could tell 
the truth, and probably be shot for 
sabotaging priceless equipment. Or 
I could explain that 1 had intention- 
ally disabled the space-warp selec- 
tion mechanism to make it accept 
living things — and I had, of course, 
bravely put myself through it as a 
test. 

No prizes for guessing what I 
told Munsen and his cohorts. 

Naturally, I was the hero of the 
hour. USF dignitaries kept coming 
to see me, more and more important 
ones, finally capped by a visit from 



A CERTAIN PLACE IN HISTORY 



15 




the eminent USF President himself. 

After two days of steady adula- 
tion, I'd had more than enough and 
wanted to go and attend to my 
long-neglected tooth. I had guarded 
my secret of the space warp closely, 
after I heard what had happened 
when I had left the asteroid. Mun- 
sen had tried to send himself 
through and the machine wouldn’t 
do it. Maybe my transmission had 
been its last dying gasp, or perhaps 
it was self-repairing and had 
restored itself to its original selec- 
tive condition. 

1 left Tycho Base with their 
praises ringing in my ears and went 
back to the City. I hated it. God 
knows what they’d put into my 
computer file about this one. I 
didn’t want to be dragged out again 
next time they needed a hero. 

Back in my apartment came the 
unkindest cut of all. I’d been an- 
swering questions and shaking 
hands for two full days at Tycho 
Base, in no real hurry because my 
mushroom monopoly deal was 
dead. But when I arrived back 
home and switched on the holovi- 
sion, the date was three days earlier 
than my watch showed. The warp 
was instantaneous, but only to the 
outside observer. No wonder my de- 
lirious moans had been completely 
ignored when I was picked up — no 
one understood that I’d spent three 
subjective days in that suit. 

If I’d known the real date. I’d 
have had time left to sew up my 
stock deal and get my commissions 



after we got back to Tycho. Instead, 
I’d sat about for days as a USF 
showpiece for their VIPs. Most 
annoying of all, I might have guess- 
ed that the warp might not be in- 
stantaneous for the transferred 
object — because I knew what the 
warp had been used for. 

The Kaneelians had come to the 
Solar System for a while, then 
packed up their furniture and moved 
on. They were ten meters tall, but 
like humans in one respect — who 
bothers to take the empty trash cans 
with them when they move house? 
Who cares whether their garbage - 
disposal unit sends the trash a mil- 
lion miles or a billion miles, or how 
long the garbage believes it is in 
transit? The scanner made good 
sense too. The Kaneelians were like 
humans in some other ways — 
household appliances had to be safe 
and child-proof. 

Imre Munsen had declared, in 
one of his more inflated introduc- 
tions, that I had a sure place in his- 
tory. I could imagine it, ringing 
down the ages. Henry Carver, the 
only man since time began to be 
accepted by, and transferred 
through, an alien garbage-disposal 
unit. 

I sat in front of my holovision, 
thinking of my lost commissions 
and wondering how long it would 
be before anyone else came to the 
same conclusion about the function 
of the Kaneelian space warp. At 
last I reached for the videophone 
and made a dental appointment, if

THE PROLOGUE TO LIGHT 




For them, it was like a 
pilgrimage — but with destina- 
tion unknown. 



Rattrack hurried. His shoes 
slapped against the long steel av- 
enue of the city at night. His back 
was straight. He was the picture of 
a man with somewhere to go, some- 
thing to do there, a very unusual 
sight in the night city. There was 
enough light to walk by, the glow 
of a few high apartment windows 
reflected in the shiny metal street. 
Some of these lights moved as he 
walked, moved as the apartments 
and buildings silently rearranged 
themselves without disturbing the 
sleep of the dayfolk. The city was 
preparing itself for tomorrow, work- 
ing its changes at a time when no 
one of consequence could see. 

Behind him, the sound of Clave’s 
chair rose in pitch, if such a wheez- 
ing, grinding, unhealthy mechanical 
noise could be said to have an hon- 
est pitch. The chair pulled alongside 
and matched Rattrack ’s pace, one 
side noticeably listing. The spotlight 
in front glowed faint, almost invisi- 
ble red along its filament. The en- 
tire carriage wobbled slightly as 
Clave leaned forward, shifting his 
weight to his knobby elbows. 

“She might not make it. Rat- 
track,” he said. “The grid changed 



again last night. It’s become all 
twisty-tumy on the west end. She 
may be stuck there.” 

It happened, of course. It hap- 
pened that the streets changed, that 
a building would slip down into the 
street and reappear elsewhere, trans- 
forming a cul-de-sac into a night- 
long prison. It even happened that 
you simply became lost in some 
newly erected street maze, ar- 
ranged for the amusement of the 
dayfolk. But it didn’t happen often. 
You could always get your bearings 
if you found the steel avenue. The 
steel avenue never changed, or at 
least never had. It cut east to west 
like a river flowing through the 
heart of the city, or the mirror by 
which the city could see its 
changes. It was a rule of the game. 

“She’s here somewhere,” said 
Rattrack, and he kept walking. 

“Don’t get all fuddy mad, Rat- 
track,” said Clave. “Her meal may 
have come late. The machinery 
could be broken. She might have de- 
cided not to come.” And those 
were possibilities too. 

“Back away. Clave,” said Rat- 
track. “She’s met me for the last 
forty nights and she won’t miss this 
one.” 

“I’m sorry, Rattrack. Excuse me. 
Sorry.” Clave spun his chair around 
and fell out of sight to the rear. The 
grumble of the machine faded until 
it was no more than a whisper, 
about one hundred meters away. 

Big man, Rattrack thought. Big 
man to chase off a runt like Clave. 



THE PROLOGUE TO LIGHT 



19 




But there was not time to waste on 
awkward apologies. Best to forget 
it. Clave would forgive; he always 
did. 

Rattrack listened to the racket of 
the chair, reduced to a breath be- 
hind him. *He liked that sound. It 
reminded him of the nights when 
he was a Troller, when the chair 
was his to skim low through the 
dark streets. Damn them for taking 
it from him. Damn them. Them? 
There was no such easily fingered 
them,” not the Trollers, not the 
five million dayfolk asleep behind 
the black walls of the buildings. It 
was only the city, the city and its 
games. Double damn the city then. 

A distant scream of high terror 
came from his left, then silence. It 
was only a sound of the night city, 
nothing unusual in a scream. He 
went on, ears keyed to the slap of 
his shoes, the whisper of Clave’s 
chair, the dead silence of the city 
around them. Directly overhead he 
saw the faint reflection of a top- 
floor apartment light on the city 
dome. Something nice about that 
elusive glimmering on a field of 
pure black. The undersized tunic 
chaffed at his underarms and he 
shrugged with discomfort, walked 
on. The muffled chutter of a Troller 
passed somewhere out of sight. 

He heard the sounds before he 
saw the woman: a dull thump, 
scrapes and shuffles, the slap of 
running feet, again the thump. 
There were few lights here, and 
Rattrack nearly walked by before he 



saw her huddled against the build- 
ing. He hesitated, went over. She 
looked up at him. Blood covered 
one eye and ran down her chin. The 
tips of her hair were blonde, but the 
rest was black and matted. She 
lifted her hand to him and he helped 
her up. On her feet, she couldn’t 
seem to orient herself. She stumbled 
away and back, then fell up against 
the building, each breath like the 
blow of an ax. She smiled. She 
pushed herself away, reeling like a 
drunkard until she stopped in the 
middle of the street. She steadied 
herself, lowered her head, and ran 
full tilt into the wall. There was a 
crack when she hit. 

The silence was complete. Clave 
had run from the disturbance, of 
course. Rattrack took a step, was 
appalled by the sound of his foot- 
fall. But this was absurd. It was 
onl^ a death, and the night was 
waiting, Zylyphony was some- 
where. He knelt and touched her 
arm. She must have been an artist. 
Artists often gave in early, no inks, 
no paper, no clay, no visions in- 
spired by the chew. 

He heard the chutter a moment 
before the Troller’s spotlight swung 
onto the avenue. The light flashed 
along the metal street and Rattrack 
caught a glimpse of a shape, some- 
one standing against the buildings 
across the street, watching. 

The Troller came up and hovered 
in his chair a few meters away. 
“Zero one six. I’ve got it.” He 
swung the muzzle of his roper 



20 



GALAXY 




around at the dead woman, pushed 
the button, and sat back, popping a 
chew in his mouth. He yawned and 
stared at the black sky. At no time 
did he look at Rattrack or even so 
much as motion in his direction. A 
thin white ribbon snaked from the 
roper and settled around the wom- 
an’s head. It began to wind tightly 
and evenly, covering first the 
bloody scalp, then moving down to 
the forehead, the eyes, mashing the 
nose flat and lifting the head 
slightly so as to loop underneath. 

Rattrack said, “Good, you enjoy 
your work.” 

The Troller said nothing, did 
not move. The roper covered the 
corpse’s neck and started down its 
shoulders, pulling the arms tight to 
the ribs. 

“It’s a tough job,” said Rattrack, 
“really important work, and a mar- 
vel that you handle it so well.” 

The roper swathed hips, then 
bound legs and feet. The line slip- 
ped back into the muzzle, dragging 
the long white cocoon off the 
ground until it dangled by a single 
thread, the head bare centimeters 
off the ground. The line snapped 
and was snagged by a small hook 
on the underside of the chair. 

“She’s secure now,” said Rat- 
track. “You’re a real hero.” 

The Troller swung the spotlight at 
Rattrack. “Stay out, duddy,” he 
said. “Four hours to light. Stay out 
of your scuddy little hidy-hole just a 
minute too long. I’ll find you. I 
don’t forget a face.” 



Rattrack laughed. He forced him- 
self to look into the explosion of 
light. His eyes were on fire. “You 
too, duddy,” he said. “Wait till 
you make a mistake and you’re out 
in the nightlife without your chair. 
See how you get along. I don’t 
forget a face either.” 

The Troller spat and swung his 
chair past Rattrack’s nose. He sped 
off, riding low so that the corpse 
dragged along the ground. 

Rattrack laughed again. “Ho 
Zylyphony,” he called, staving off 
the silence, waiting for his eyes to 
work again. “Did you see that? 
There goes one more Troller who 
knows Rattrack.” He started across 
the street toward the shadows where 
the Troller’s spotlight had revealed 
her. He knew it must be her. 
“Zylyphony? Come out!” 

The shadows were empty. 

He began to stroll down the 
street, brushing his hand along the 
satin building facades. She was 
here, somewhere. Then he heard the 
buzz and flattened against a wall. It 
was a warden. 

It came up the street, a fist-sized 
metal beetle, a blur of speed, a 
flicker running through each patch 
of light. It was heat in motion, 
could bum away any stain, could 
cut through a man like cheese and 
leave a well -cauterized stump. It 
was perfect, untouchable, and Rat- 
track hated it. 

The warden slowed at the blood 
on the street, moved crab-like over 
the sea. It went up the side of the 



THE PROLOGUE TO LIGHT 



21 




building and down again, then sped 
off the way it came. It took sec- 
onds, and nothing remained, no 
char, no unobserved splatter, noth- 
ing. 

Rattrack stepped away from the 
wall. There was a sound, he turned, 
and Zylyphony was standing just 
out from the buildings a few paces 
away. She was looking. no, not 
at him. It seemed that she never 
looked directly at him, but the 
thinnest of hairs to the right, or left, 
or above. Her hair was a garland of 
dark curls. She was like one of the 
apartment window lights, impossi- 
ble to reach, framed by night. 

He gave her a smile though he 
knew she would not return it. “Did 
you see me with the Troller?’’ 

“Yes,” she said, and somehow 
the way that she said it, eyes away 
from his, a solitary nod without en- 
thusiasm or even familiarity, stole 
the victory from him. 

He felt for a moment that he 
could take no more, that this small 
hurt would burst the dam that bound 
his entire ocean of pain, that he 
would be finally ruined, forced over 
the edge of the abyss. Not yet. He 
closed his eyes, felt it all settle in- 
side of him. It seemed, had seemed 
for some time, that his body was no 
longer a simple package of blood 
and tissues. It was an envelope for 
his anguish, his hate of the city. To 
strike a spark of life in this dull- 
eyed woman was no longer a game. 
TTie joke had gone too far, had 
turned sour and then rancid. Forty 



nights, and now he knew that, like 
everything else that had happened in 
his life, again it was the city trying 
to make him small, diminishing him 
by reducing this woman to nothing 
and throwing her in his face. 

He stepped over and took her 
arm. “Walk with me,” he said. 
And she came along as he had 
known she would, not willing, not 
protesting. She just came along. To 
their right, a building slid 
noiselessly into the street, a stately 
vertical descent. Before the roof 
was level with the street, the build- 
ing behind it started down, and the 
one behind that, one after the other 
until a new street led off into the 
dark. He would take her to the 
fountain again (if it was still there) 
and do. something again. 

They turned off the steel avenue 
into deeper shadows. Before they 
had gone far, the sound of Clave’s 
chair came through the night and 
took up its station, one hundred 
meters behind. 

As he came into the courtyard, 
Rattrack saw two men hunched fur- 
tively in the light. They muttered 
his name to each other, and crept 
away into the night. 

The fountain was still there, and 
again it had changed. The first night 
they had seen it, nearly two weeks 
ago, it had been little more than a 
large flat basin, a few sculpted fig- 
ures, a few climbing blocks. Each 
night it had grown, and now it was 
a huge forest of thin red towers and 
spiral chutes that climbed perhaps 



22 



GALAXY 




half as high as the buildings. It 
glowed with a pale yellow light, 
bringing an illusion of animation to 
the dark circle of buildings standing 
shoulder to shoulder around it like 
cautious spectators. It was a specta- 
cle in still-life. It was Rattrack’s 
favorite mystery. Why only this in 
all the city to relieve the black of 
night? Why did this and nothing 
else change its shape by day? The 
towers and pools were dry now, as 
they would always be at night, but 
Rattrack saw water. He closed his 
eyes and was sliding down a chute, 
the tall one in the center, a twisting 
kilometer- long stream of water with 
the city revolving around him and 
the chew in his bloodstream playing 
tricks with his eyes and brain. He 
imagined the slide becoming a pool, 
and then perhaps a great jet of 
water to send him back to the top 
while showering those below. To 
ride a waterfall. He could have 
cried. 

He slapped his thigh with the flat 
of his hand, felt a satisfying sting. 
“Come on,” he said to Zylyphony. 
“We’ll explore.” 

She stepped back and sat on the 
black street, looking down. 

“All right then,” he said. He 
would not let it hurt. “Stay here.” 
He set his eye for the pinnacle of 
the tallest spire, clambered over the 
uneven blocks on the floor of the 
fountain, and began to climb. 

The banked walls of the spiral 
channel were purchase for his hands 
and the slick soles of his shoes. 



There was nothing to his left but 
open space. It was a long climb. 
Halfway up, when he had begun to 
tire, he stopped to take off his shoes 
and wipe the sweat from his palms. 
He looked at the ground. Zylyphony 
was dimly lit by the fountain glow, 
small as a marble. She seemed to 
be looking away, although he could 
not be sure. What must he do to 
catch her eye? Should he scream 
and wave his arms? Would she look 
up if he Jumped? Clave was a dis- 
tance from her around the perim- 
eter of the fountain, disconnected 
from his shadow by the space be- 
neath his chair. Rattrack looked 
back at her. She was not watching. 
He dropped his shoes over the edge 
and started up again, pushing for 
speed now, trying to use up the ten- 
sion that had grabbed his muscles 
and made him clench his teeth. 

Then he was on a small platform 
at the top. Zylyphony and Clave 
were dots. It was a long way down, 
a quicker suicide, he thought, than 
banging your head against a wall. 
But not for him, never for him. One 
thing that Rattrack never feared was 
his own death. He did not believe 
in it. A breeze could have blown 
him from the tiny perch, but there 
was no breeze in the city. He 
looked around, and even from this 
height, even with the light from the 
fountain, he could not see the flat 
level edges of the rooftops. He fol- 
lowed the marching lines of black 
windows with his eyes until they 
seemed to merge somewhere over-

head with the black walls of the 
buildings. He looked higher still, 
until the buildings blended in with 
the black sky and the unseen dome. 
He looked up until he stood like an 
arrow perched on end, his mouth 
pulled open -by the stretch of skin 
over his jaws, and for the first and 
only time, he felt small. The weight 
of insignificance fell on him like a 
physical thing and he dropped to 
one knee, trembling hands curled 
around the edges of his tiny plat- 
form. He saw a dead woman with a 
bloody head. He came up slowly, 
first placing his feet and straighten- 
ing his knees, then uncoiling along 
his spine, raising his chin again. He 
took the collar of his tunic in both 
hands and ripped it open from ster- 
num to navel. 

“It’s Rattrack!” he screamed. 
“Open your lights or huddle in the 
dark. It’s Rattrack!” 

The city answered him with si- 
lence. 

“Enough,” he said, his voice 
cold and loud enough for only him- 
self to hear. “I know you. I know 
what you can do to people. I know 
the sad smiles of your dayfolk when 
they try to forget that they have 
nowhere new to go. I know their 
desperate chatter, their endless 
games. I know the triviality of your 
imagination. 

“I tried to leave you and there 
was nowhere to go. For that you 
have taken me from the day. Now I 
say to you that I will not be de- 
voured. There is a woman down 



there to whom you owe a soul. It’s 
time you began to pay your debts.” 

He scrambled down the chute, 
friction searing the heels of his 
hands. He skidded around the wid- 
ening turns of the spiral, down, 
down, the floor of the city growing 
in his eyes. He Jumped the last four 
meters and walked toward 
Zylyphony. Clave rode up to him 
and then stopped, watching with 
rabbit eyes as Rattrack walked past. 

He took Zylyphony by the rough 
sleeve of her tunic and pulled her to 
her feet. She came up limply. 

“I ask you for the last time,” he 
said. “Must you let the city do this 
to you? Can you allow it?” 

She did not look at him even 
now. “You don’t understand,” she 
said. “Who are we to allow or not 
allow? If we didn’t exist, the city 
would go on just as it always has 
with all these buildings empty, the 
streets quiet. It makes no dif- 
ference. I stay alive because it’s 
easier than dying. I come with you 
because. who am I to say no? 
But it doesn’t matter. The city is a 
machine and to be human is nothing 
special.” 

Clave charged up to them, sitting 
high in his chair. '"He’s special. 
He’s—” 

“Shut up. Clave.” Rattrack did 
not turn his head. “I won’t let the 
city have you,” he said. “We make 
ourselves special by what we do.” 
He smiled. “I intend to make you 
come alive, really alive, if it kills 
you.”

He pulled her by the arm and 
started up the street. Clave followed 
behind. They went back along their 
route, back until they were standing 
again on the steel avenue. Rattrack 
motioned Clave forward, pushed a 
switch on the chair. With Clave 
gripping the arms as if it were a 
wild beast, it sailed up the avenue 
with Rattrack and Zylyhony run- 
ning behind. 

It was faster than they and they 
lost sight of it in the darkness. They 
could hear it wheezing and chug- 
ging ahead of them for a time until 
it pulled out of earshot. Rattrack 
slowed his pace. 

“What are you thinking about 
right now?” he asked. This was the 
best sort of light for her. It softened 
her face, made her look close. 

“I was wondering what it is.” 

“What?” 

“I’m not curious,” she said. 
“No, I just thought it might be 
easier if you told me what you re- 
ally want from me. If it’s sex, you 
can have it. If you want talk. I’ll 
talk.” 

“What I want.” As if it was 
small enough to be made into 
words. As if he could just say it 
and be done. “Just a couple of little 
things. I want to prove that every- 
thing you say is wrong. I want to 
make the city, the whole scuddy 
damned city, look up and say my 
name! Think you can take care of it 
right now, or would you prefer to 
wait a bit?” 

The chair was hovering above a 



wide hold in the middle of the street 
where there had been no hole or 
seam minutes before. “What is this 
thing, Rattrack?” Clave said. 
“It — The chair came and — Every- 
thing feels different and I’m 
scared.” 

“It’s all right,” he said. “The 
chair homes in on this spot when 
you close that switch. It’s for the 
Trollers.” 

Clave twisted around in the seat, 
looking down the street in a 
paroxysm of terror. Rattrack and 
Zylyphony walked to the edge of 
the hole. It was a cylindrical shaft 
running straight down into the body 
of the city, seven meters around and 
darker than the night. Zylyphony 
shuddered and looked away, and 
this, obscurely, seemed to him just 
right. 

“Such a deeply dark place, Rat- 
track,” said Clave, making a 
ludicrous attempt at self-control. 
“What is it? Where does it go?” 

“Ah Clave,” he said histrioni- 
cally, “it’s the place of the dead, 
the last journey of our departed 
nightlife fellows. This is the true 
shrine where Trollers make their 
grisly offering to — ” He snorted at 
himself, failed a grin. There was a 
demand for drama in the air, a 
time, a tempo of events, and it 
would not do to just start down, 
pulling her after like a sack of 
stones. 

He stood by the hole, waited for 
the upbeat. “Will you come?” he 
said finally. 



THE PROLOGUE TO LIGHT

She shuddered again and shrug- 
ged, but when he swung his legs 
over the edge and lowered himself 
until only his head showed above 
the street, she sat down beside him 
and prepared to follow. 

Clave called out, “I’d come too, 
Rattrack. I’d like to come but 1 
don’t think my body will move. No, 
it’s all fuddy tight. I don’t think I 
can move at all.’’ 

“Stay if you want,’’ Rattrack 
said, “but it’s safe. That chair has 
been down here before. This is 
where I hid it from the Trollers.” 

“That’s fine,” Clave said des- 
perately. “It’s safe. I’ll putter-put 
along with you just as soon as 1 can 
move.” 

* h * 

A spiral ledge ran clockwise 
down the wall of the shaft. Al- 
though it was not quite wide enough 
to safely walk along, it could be 
used as a ladder, each “rung” 
nicely spaced half a meter below 
the next. Rattrack started down with 
Zylyphony at his left, matching him 
step for step. They had descended 
about a hundred meters when they 
heard a sound above them. It was 
Clave’s chair slowly moving into 
position above the hole. 

Rattrack smiled and felt more at 
ease with the sound of the chair 
near. 

The other time he had come here, 
Rattrack had been in the chair and 
had hardly noticed the length of the 



journey. Now it seemed to have no 
end. He climbed until his arms and 
legs, already tired from the fountain 
tower, began to twitch and then 
spasm. He made himself go a little 
farther, thinking each step, not al- 
lowing the illusory colors of the 
darit to distract him. He went on 
until he could not, and then called 
for a rest. 

They sat on the ledge, the level 
above brushing their heads. Rattrack 
did not try to speak. He breathed, 
leaned back, tried to accommodate 
himself to the condition of being 
unable to tell if his eyelids were 
open or closed. He heard the grum- 
ble of Clave’s machine, hollow and 
echoing above them, and. some- 
thing else. He reached out to hold 
Zylyphony motionless. “Do you 
hear something?” 

“I don’t — ” 

He squeezed her arm. “Shush.” 
There it was again, a whizzing 
sound, something like a ball bearing 
rolling down a ramp at great speed. 

“I hear it,” Zylyphony said. 

It was very faint but growing 
louder, and there was a modulation 
to the volume. It was loud then 
soft, loud then soft, taking about a 
second to complete each cycle, as if 
it were something moving very fast, 
around and around. Where had he 
heard that sound before? 

“It’s a warden,” Zylyphony said. 
She sounded . frightened? No, 
but her voice was alive. “There’s a 
warden on the ledge.” 

For a moment he didn’t under- 



26 



GALAXY 




stand. Then he twisted around to 
climbing position. He could not see 
the top of the shaft and the thing 
was coming up — how fast? By the 
sound of it, one level every second, 
thirty meters each minute. He stop- 
ped himself from trying to figure 
how long it would take them to 
reach the top. 

He called up to Clave, “Stay 
away from the walls.” 

“Hands, then feet,” Zylyphony 
said. 

“What?” 

“Listen.” Her voice was close to 
his ear. “We hold on with only our 
hands while it passes by our feet. 
Then we balance on our feet and 
keep our hands away from the ledge 
until it’s gone.” 

He could think of nothing else to 
do. They stood there, listening to 
the noise grow louder. It seemed to 
fill the shaft, each whoosh blending 
into the next. He heard Zylyphony 
expel a short breath. A giggle? 
Why didn’t they try to hold onto the 
chair until it passed? The chair 
might have held them all. How 
would they know when it was on 
the level below them? 

Then he felt the vibration as it 
passed beneath them, and they both 
yelled “Now!” simultaneously. A 
heartbeat while it seemed that his 
arms were stretching like rubber 
bands, and then “Now!” He 
planted his feet on the lower ledge, 
jerked his hands away. Too fast. 
His balance was uncertain. He 
began to pitch away from the wall. 



threw his left hand forward to grip 
the ledge as a pictuiv of endless fall- 
ing, his body revolving through the 
darkness, imprinted itself on his 
mind. He held the ledge. 

A feather seemed to brush by his 
fingers. The pain came a second 
later and he screamed, pulled back 
reflexively and would have fallen if 
Zylyphony’s hand had not pressed 
against his back, steadying him. He 
sobbed, his left hand held tight to 
his stomach, his right hand squeez- 
ing the ledge again and again. 

Clave lowered his chair until he 
was level with them, nearly swat- 
ting them off the ledge in his haste. 
“A warden, Rattrack.” His voice 
shook and broke. “A warden Just 
went zippity by me not that far 
from my nose. Oh Rattrack, it’s so 
fuddy dark — You’re hurt!” 

Rattrack moved his right hand 
along the ledge, unable to keep 
himself still for the pain. The sur- 
face was still warm from the war- 
den’s passing. His hand touched 
something small and soft. He felt it, 
rolling it between his thumb and 
forefinger, and then he realized 
what it was. He slid his hand along, 
felt two more. They were three fin- 
gertips neatly lined up on the ledge 
where the warden had cut them 
from his hand in passing. He swept 
them into the darkness, nearly los- 
ing his balance again. 

“Let’s go out, Rattrack,” said 
Clave. “You can use the chair. 
Let’s go — ” 

“Go?” The decision was already 

27 



THE PROLOGUE TO LIGHT 




made. “When it did this to me?” 
iiis body spoke and felt pain, and 
none of it touched the perfect, cold 
certainty of him. The pustule had 
burst. This was only the beginning. 
“To me!” He slammed the wall with 
his good hand and started down. 
Without a word, as it should be. 
Clave and Zylyphony followed. 

It was only five steps down, five 
awkward steps of hand and elbow, 
before they came to a blue light in 
the wall. Above it was an illumi- 
nated sign: AUTHORIZED PER- 

SONNEL ONLY. He touched the 
spot of color and a section of the 
wall opened, large enough to admit 
the chair. They stepped from dark 
into light. 

There was a floor and a thin 
glowing path, a meter wide, that 
ran into the distance like a dare. Rat- 
track had been here before. He sat 
cross-legged on the lighted path 
without a glance at his surroundings 
and began to massage his left hand, 
trying to work the weakness out of 
it. The hand would not make a fist. 
The fingers curled slightly and then 
stopped, trembling. They would 
move no further, no matter how 
strongly he urged the muscles. He 
looked at the hand, noticing how 
peculiar and square it seemed, not 
as if it were a part of him at all. 
The middle finger was cut between 
the top joint and the fingernail. The 
index and fourth fingers both had 
bits of nail still attached. He used 
his tight hand to curl the fingers, 
and the pain hit again, worse than 



before. He doubled over, puking, 
and rocked back and forth, unable 
to open his eyes. He felt a hand on 
his shoulder. “Get away,” he said. 
The acidic vomit in his throat made 
him cough. “Let me be.” He 
needed some time, that’s all, just 
some time. 

Zylyphony stepped back, hugged 
herself and shivered. The air was 
much colder than the constant 
temperature of the city. She shook 
her head, walked a few paces away 
from Rattrack. She looked around. 
There was too much to think about 
and she was not ready. 

The light of this place was bright 
only in contrast to the dark of the 
shaft. Now she could see the 
shadows, the limits of her field of 
vision. The place was immense. 
There were no walls she could see, 
no ceiling. The floor stretched away 
from her in every direction, a plain 
of metal broken only by a sparse 
maze of thin columns rising from 
floor to. where? Shadows in the 
distance, massive and indistinct, 
seemed to nse and fall like oily 
waves. She shut her eyes, stamped 
her foot to test the solidity of the 
floor. She was grabbed by a sudden 
abandon and she whirled around 
madly, joyously, then stopped just 
as suddenly, dizzy and cold, afraid. 
Just the chill, she told herself. 

She looked back and saw the 
shaft by which they had descended, 
a shiny cylinder running from the 
floor to. how far? Distances 
were impossible in this place. That 



28 



GALAXY 




column over there, for example. 
She judged it to be no more than 
fifteen meters away, and she walked 
toward it, counting her steps. One 
hundred paces later she was about 
to give up, deciding that the thing 
must be moving away from her. 
And then she came to it with a sud- 
den and absolute abridgment of 
distance. It was thinner than her 
smallest finger. She would not have 
seen it had it not thrown the light 
from the path directly back at her. 
She leaned her cheek against it and 
looked up. How far? She imagined, 
wanted to believe, that it ran up 
through the street of the city into 
the soft warmth of an apartment 
where someone slept, dreaming of 
the sun. She touched it with the tip 
of her tongue, feeling the tingle of 
metal at the back of her hose. A 
sound traveled through the column, 
the faint thrumming of heavy 
machines. She pushed away from it 
and began to retrace her steps. 

Clave rode up to her as she 
walked. “How is he?” she said. 

“He hurts fuddy bad. He wanted 
to know where you were.” 

“I’m coming.” 

Clave turned, then swung the 
chair around again. His fingers 
trembled at the controls, and the 
chair shuffled back and forth in the 
air. A pause, then he said, “It hap- 
pened because of you. He’s only 
here because of you.” 

She retreated a step from the in- 
tensity of his pain, his anger, and 
his fear. “I don’t want any of 




THE PROLOGUE TO LIGHT 



29 



this,” she said. “I’m only here 
because — No, wait!” She walked 
toward him. “I’m sorry. Clave, but 
I’m not responsible. I only want to 
be left alone. I just want a place 
that’s warm and quiet. I want — No, 
this is all wrong.” She folded her 
arms over her head, felt as if she 
were stretched paper-thin along the 
cold endless floor. “I don’t know,” 
she whispered. “I don’t know any- 
thing except — Clave?” He was 
waiting, motionless, a sphinx. “I 
want to live. When that war- 
den. I want to live! It’s fuddy 
dumb, but I didn’t know that be- 
fore.” 

He scratched his ear. “Something 
is different with you.” 

“I’ll ask him to go back,” she 
said, “for you. You love him, don’t 
you?” 

The chair did its curious shuffle 
again. “I don’t know,” and he sped 
off to hover around Rattrack like a 
distraught mother. 

Zylyphony watched him go. He 
was right; she had changed. She put 
her hand to her face. The flesh of 
her cheek was still cold from the 
touch of the metal column. Her 
palm warmed the spot. To live 
again, to want. She had changed 
and felt a bit afraid of how little she 
knew of what she had become. 

Rattrack walked toward her as 
she approached the path. He looked 
pale, even in that dim light, but 
seemed composed. “We should stay 
on the lighted path,” he said. 
“Things move around out here.” 



“You don’t have to go on,” she 
said, “not if you came down here to 
prove something to me. I don’t 
think I need it anymore. You can 
go back now.” 

Rattrack laughed the laugh of a 
confused man. “Well, there was 
that, of course,” he said. “Wanting 
to prove something to you, I sup- 
pose. But now. As long as 
we’re here, we might as well look 
around. Why not?” 

“Because you’re hurt and you’re 
weak, and this place may be 
dangerous. Wait until you’re well.” 

“What’s happened to you? I feel 
fine.” 

“Rattrack,” said Clave, “it’s a 
dubby bad place and it makes me 
shake all over. Let’s go — ” 

“Shut up, you.” He took a step 
toward the chair and Clave raced 
away with a look of terror. Rattrack 
turned back to her. He would not 
meet her eyes. “It’s not just you,” 
he said. 

“What else?” 

“This!” He raised his maimed 
hand and shook it. “This scuddy 
damned city took my hand. I’ll take 
something from it before I go. I’ll 
show it Rattrack. I’ll teach Rattrack 
to it. Then I’ll go back. Is that an- 
swer enough? Will it do? Come, 
Clave.” He strode off toward the 
lighted path. 

She watched him go, then looked 
toward the metal chute, the pathway 
back. She didn’t know what to ex- 
pect from herself. She was a 
stranger in her own skin. She heard 



30 



GALAXY 




the sound of Clave’s chair and 
turned. He was looking at her, 
apologetic, perhaps hopeful. She 
managed a smile. “There’s nothing 
back there anyway,” she said. “In 
a way he’s right. Why not go on?” 

They went on together, and did 
not hurry to catch Rattrack. 

She was thankful for the familiar 
sound of the chair. She saw nothing 
more ominous than that vaporous 
shifting of shadows in the distance, 
but everything looked as if it were 
underwater, so tenuous was the 
light and so indistinct were the 
shapes. Nothing seemed quite real 
or substantial except the sound of 
the chair and the stark ribbon of the 
path, as if there were no floor, as if 
she could step off the edge and fall 
lazily forever. She stopped trying to 
grasp the scale of this place, and 
realized after a time that she had 
settled on a false but comforting no- 
tion that it was really very small, 
that the darkness was walls, that 
those vague peripheral movements 
came from the rustling of a thin 
paper backdrop just a few steps 
away on either side. 

She smiled. Clave, by her side, 
was repeating a baby rhyme to 
himself, a creche song that she re- 
membered from her own childhood. 
It went; Go to sleep, child, close 
your eyes. Tomorrow morning the 
sun will rise. Strange that memory 
could be so painless. The rhyme 
reminded her of another snatch of 
verse, the last lines of a poem she 
had never loved, but which came to 



her now. Fear not shadows of the 
night. Dark is prologue to the light. 

Clave said, “When I was in the 
creche, they said 1 was the bad 
one. The habilitators said so, the 
other children said so. They said, 
you’re the bad one. You’re the one 
the nightlife’s going to get. And 
they were right. I couldn’t do any- 
thing. 1 wasn’t an artist, or a nurse, 
or a thinker. I was too stupid to be 
a hydroponics duddy. I didn’t like 
the games or the shouting house. 
Oh, I was fuddy bad. All I could do 
was watch and listen. It took 
twenty-five years, but the nightlife 
did get me, it did. ...” 

* * * 

The child is angry, pouting, defi- 
ant. “I won’t go,” he says. His 
back is against the wall and his 
pudgy little hands are fists. “I don’t 
want to go.” 

The habilitator nods, looks at 
Zylyphony with a shrug and at the 
other strollers who have stopped to 
gawk. “Oh my, no,” the habilitator 
says with exaggerated clarity. “If 
you don’t want to go, of course we 
won’t. The very idea!” She smiles 
tolerantly for the crowd. 

“I want to go back,” the boy 
protests. 

“Well, we can’t quite do that,” 
she says. “Of course if you don’t 
want to go to the shouting house, we 
won’t, but it’s what we are 
scheduled to do, you see. If we 
don’t do what we are scheduled to 



THE PROLOGUE TO LIGHT 



31 




do, then there is no schedule and 
we can’t do anything at all. I’m 
sure you can understand. So you 
have a choice, you see. We can go 
to the shouting house or we can do 
nothing.” 

The crowd is growing thicker. 
Someone jostles Zylyphony, makes 
the sign of apology and moves 
away. She doesn’t mind. She is 
quite taken with this little drama, 
very nearly genuinely interested. 
Besides, the sun is bright. Lunch 
was good. This feels to be one of 
her good days. 

The habilitator waits patiently 
while the boy looks around the cir- 
cle of faces, until his shoulders 
slump and he walks away from the 
wall. ‘‘Ready to go now?” she 
says. "Want to?” He nods, head 
hanging. “Very well, as long as 
you want to.” Then, as they push 
their way through the crowd, ‘‘You 
had better be careful, young man. 
It’ll be the nightlife for you if you 
go on this way.” 

The crowd chuckles its apprecia- 
tion and begins to break, everyone 
talking to his or her neighbor, seri- 
ous or delighted with the episode. 
Zylyphony exchanges pleasantries 
with a woman who is intrigued by 
the metaphysical subdual implicit in 
the nightlife concept. “. .perfec- 
tion, of course, being the obverse of 
the entire gestalt. ...” 

And yes, Zylyphony can see the 
point, that the nightlife fiction 
serves to point out the perfection of 
the city. And of course it is absurd 



to consider it on any other level. It 
is the ancient Hell myth revamped, 
given substance by the people who 
invent stories of their experiences as 
Trollers, and by the tales about 
people who disappear at night. If 
only (and she shudders a bit at the 
thought), if only it were true. If 
only she could spend a single night 
away from this damned perfection. 

Anything to pass the time. 

* * * 

‘‘What?” she said. 

Clave looked at her. ‘‘I stopped 
eating the chew,” he said. ‘‘I found 
out about it and stopped zippity 
quick. Then one night the Trollers 
came for me and dropped me in the 
street. They didn’t even tell me 
where the hidy-hole was. Rattrack 
saved me.” He leaned toward her. 
‘‘You don’t think I’m still a bad 
one, do you?” He studied her eyes. 
‘‘No, you don’t,” he said finally. 
‘‘How could you? You’re here. You 
must be one too.” He sat back with 
a sigh of satisfaction. 

‘‘Yes, Clave,” she said, not re- 
ally speaking to him. ‘‘I’m a bad 
one all right. I stopped talking with 
people, and that’s bad enough, to 
the city.” 

‘‘Oh, I never talked with any- 
one,” said Clave. ‘‘I said a lot of 
things, but no one said anything 
back to me.” 

‘‘What was it that you found out 
about the chew?” 

His voice dropped to a conspirato- 



32 



GALAXY 




rial whisper. “It’s not a food,” he 
said. “It’s really a little machine. It 
gets inside of you and changes your 
belly into a machine and makes all 
your veins into wires. It makes your 
brain a machine.” He looked away 
from her. “You don’t believe me.” 

“I believe you,” she said. “It’s 
true enough.” 

She saw the movement in the 
comer of her eye. It was almost 
overhead, a tiny black square drop- 
ping from the ceiling (not the real 
ceiling, of course, but as high as 
she could see), sliding down on noth- 
ing, or perhaps she could see just 
a hint of silver thread at each 
comer. Yes, now that it was a bit 
closer and larger, she could defi- 
nitely see threads at each comer. 
Still, it was small enough to block 
out with her thumb held at arm’s 
length from her eye. A little closer 
now. It was a cube, and there was 
something familiar. 

And then her careful little scheme 
of perspective exploded as she re- 
alized how huge, how impossibly 
vast, it was. The silver threads were 
four metal columns, and the cube, 
the black cube — She closed her 
eyes, sat down on the path. The 
cube was a building, one of the tall 
dwellings from the city’s surface, 
all the windows opaque so the day- 
folk would not be bothered with the 
workings of their home. As if they 
would care. As if there was one 
who would not call it a chew dream 
and go back to bed. 

She opened her eyes. It had come 



to rest on the floor some intermina- 
ble distance away without a sound, 
the roof still invisible in the dark- 
ness of height. It began to move at 
an angle away from her, riding be- 
tween the four thin metal columns, 
gradually picking up speed until it 
was gone. She buried her head in 
her arms. 

She heard footsteps. “I have to 
go back,” she said. “I have to go 
back. I have to — ” She made her- 
self stop. 

“Caught you by surprise?” Rat- 
track was sitting by her side. “It 
took me a while to get used to it 
too.” He was smiling. 

“I wouldn’t mind,” she said, “if 
we were going somewhere. It would 
be all right if we were going to find 
a place where people said things 
that mattered, or where the city 
wasn’t — It’s just too much. This 
place goes on forever and it’s too 
big to be real. I want to go back 
and not think about it any more.” 

“So that’s what you’ll do?” he 
said. “Go back to the nightlife and 
the nipples on the wall of the hidy- 
hole at mealtime? If the city would 
let you, you’d go back all the way, 
wouldn’t you? Back to the hours 
spent admiring some silly small 
change in something unimportant, 
back to the games played with the 
object of not winning because win- 
ning would mean the end of the 
game. Remember? Remember that 
livingroom furniture they call art? 
Remember the solipsistic absurdities 
they call thinking?”

“I remember, I remember, I re- 
member! Will you stop it? Please, 
just stop.” She felt tired and cold 
and thought that she could wait 
right there, motionless, just waiting 
for time to take it all away. “I 
don’t know,” she said at last. “The 
city won’t take me back and this is 
no worse than the nightlife, I sup- 
pose. Maybe — ” 

“What?” 

Something, a touch of life, crept 
back into her. A sneaky thing, this 
wanting. “Maybe there’ll be some- 
thing down here. People. A new 
life. I don’t know.” And it was 
gone again. “What does it matter? 
We’re all walking dead.” 

“Oh, I don’t feel so dead,” Rat- 
track said. “My hand aches a little, 
but that’s the worst of it. Besides, 
you and I at least have something to 
look for, you for your paradise and 
I — Well, let’s say that I have a debt 
to repay.” 

“Your hand?” 

“No, it’s an old debt, or you 
might call it a game.” He held up 
the damaged hand, the peculiarly 
abridged fingers. “This was the last 
move, and now it’s my turn.” 

“Your games lack an element of 
humor.” She touched the hand. 
“Does it hurt very much?” 

“Just enough to keep me awake. 
It reminds me that I’m alive.” 

She looked at him, really looked 
at him for the first time. There was 
nothing new to see; it was only her 
eyes that were different. “Is it so 
important to you to feel alive,” she 

34 



said wonderingly, “that you wel- 
come pain, that you make a per- 
sonal opponent of a machine?” 

“If the city is only a machine, 
what does that make us?” He was 
still smiling. 

Exactly. But she said nothing, 
only looked away. She started when 
his fingers touched her cheek, but 
she held down the surprise and fear, 
and reached out to touch him in re- 
turn. His eyes held hers for a long 
moment, long enough for her to 
both want to hold him closer and 
want to pull away, long enough to 
taste the silence. Then, when she 
knew that he knew he had her, his 
eyes shifted to the side, he looked 
over his shoulder down the ribbon 
of light, and said, “We shouldn’t 
waste time.” He stood, turned so she 
could not see his face. “I’ll go 
ahead to find the city — there’ll be a 
meeting between us, I assure you of 
ihat — and you can come along to 
look for that paradise of yours.” 

Paradise. Was it fair to pin a 
name on hope? But the thing she 
felt most, the thing at the top of her 
mind, was relief. 

He waited impatiently for her to 
stand. 

“Do you ever wonder who you 
are?” she asked. 

“No,” he said flatly. They 
started along in silence. She hung 
back a pace so that their hands 
would not accidentally touch as they 
walked. 

They came up to Clave a few 
minutes later. He was hovering by 



GALAXY 




an elevator platform set in the floor. 
It was the same type as the ones in 
the city’s buildings, a circle marked 
in black on the floor, half sur- 
rounded by a curving, chest-high 
wall. The lighted path looped 
around it and then continued on, 
straight as an arrow. Zylyphony and 
Rattrack stepped on together, and a 
sign flashed on the inside of the 
wall, the letters flickering dimly. 
They ignored it. 

“I won’t fit,” Clave said. 

The sign winked off and was re- 
placed by another. Zylyphony 
barely had time to read: mainte- 
nance ATM AUTO — TUNE PEr/ 
MiTTOR TO IDENT. FREQ, before this 
too was gone and three buttons had 
appeared in its place. “Going 
down,” said Rattrack. He pressed 
the second button. The floor jerked. 
There was a groan of gears and ca- 
bles, and slowly they began to sink 
beneath the works of the city. 

“Follow us down. Clave, the 
way you did in the chute,” 
Zylyphony said. Then he was gone, 
and almost immediately the elevator 
wheezed and trembled and came to 
a stop. 

She was looking out into a nar- 
row corridor bathed in a hush of 
light, dozens of smaller hallways 
branching off before it curved out 
of sight. She noticed the ceiling. 
How strange to see a ceiling so 
low. It would brush the top of her 
hair. She heard Clave’s chair lower- 
ing and stepped out of the elevator 
(o make room. 



The floor seemed to drop a frac- 
tion of a centimeter under her feet. 
She tensed, half turned, then threw 
her arm in front of her eyes as 
light, painfully brilliant, shattered 
the comfortable near-dark. She 
heard a scream from Clave, begai. 
to grope her way back to the 
elevator, almost wishing she were 
blind rather than be struck by this. 
Her eyes felt like flames in her 
skull. Then she touched a wall and 
stumbled. The floor was cold 
against her palms and the light was 
with her, even with her eyes closed, 
rosy through her eyelids. Long sec- 
onds passed before it was no longer 
painful. She held her hands up, 
opened her eyes the least possible 
degree, and looked through eye- 
lashes and between fingers. 

Light covered the wall from floor 
to ceiling and stretched two meters 
wide. Thin lines in a rainbow of 
colors flickered, danced, shifted 
from place to place with electronic 
speed and precision. She forced her 
eyes fully open (it was bearable 
now) and took a step toward the 
thing. It was too much to take in all 
at once, a maze of shifting lines, a 
mad draftsman’s nightmare. In the 
lower right-hand corner computer 
letters announced: cross section 

FROM surface ARTERIAL AND MAIN 
ACCESS TUBE (AXES Xl-Vl-Zl). It 
was beginning to make some sense 
of a bizarre sort. The shapes near 
the top looked like buildings that 
lined the steel avenue. Here was the 
hydroponics palace, the famous 



THE PROLOGUE TO LIGHT 



35 




rooftop arcade outlined in orange. 
This must be the game house — no, 
it was the shouting house. The 
game h use was over here, the 
black pentagon. 

Rattrack and Clave came over. 

“It’s the -city,” she said. She 
pointed out the landmarks. 

Rattrack nodded, pointed. “This 
is the shaft we came down.” It was 
labeled main access tube. 

“What do you think these. ?” 
With her finger she traced a group 
of thin green lines that ran a tortu- 
ous course from the top of the 
screen to the very bottom. 

He shrugged. “Com lines? 
Transport tubes? Circuits? Connec- 
tions?” He stepped forward, 
pressed his palm against the screen. 
“This can tell us everything,” he 
said. “It can tell us where the city 
is exposed, what to manipulate, 
how to get away. It can — ” He 
stopped. There was a hum in the 
air. 

“Wardens,” said Zylyphony. She 
glanced at the map. “This is the 
maintenance level. This is their 
home.” And they all heard, not the 
hum of a single warden, but the low 
pitched growl of a dozen, or two 
dozen, or more of the small 
machines. 

“The elevator,” Rattrack said. 
He took one step in that direction, 
and a warden zipped from behind 
the curved wall of the elevator. He 
barely had time to jump to one side. 
It ran out of sight around the bend 
of the corridor, slowing in prepara- 



tion for a turn as it went, and just 
as it disappeared, a pack of perhaps 
five more came around the bend, 
bearing down on them at terrifying 
speed. 

“Rattrack,” Zylyphony yelled, 
“the chair. Get up on the chair. Get 
your feet off the floor!” She was 
moving before the words were out 
of her mouth. She grabbed the back 
of the chair and hauled herself up, 
dangling for a moment and then 
wrapping her legs around the arm- 
rests. The chair groaned. 

Rattrack seemed frozen for a sec- 
ond, then scrambled up onto 
Clave’s lap. In that instant the map 
screen went black and the buzz of 
the wardens passed under them in 
the dark. 

Zylyphony pounded her fist on 
Clave’s shoulder. “Power, Clave.” 
She could not see anything in the 
sudden darkness, but she could feel 
the sensation as they floated gently 
toward the floor. The chair shivered 
and whined as it tried to compen- 
sate for the excess weight. 
“Power,” she said. A snippet of a 
popular tune played in her head in- 
sanely for a moment, then was 
gone. “Power!” Clave’s shoulder 
was like a rock; he did not move. 
She stretched her hand toward the 
controls. Her position was night- 
marishly wrong; the levers were a 
fingertip’s width from her reach. 
She began to adjust to the sudden 
darkness, saw the chair drifting 
down, saw the swarm of wardens 
beneath them churning like a hive 



36 



GALAXY 




of disturbed bees. Then Rattrack 
cursed, twisted to get his good hand 
to the proper lever, and pulled. The 
chair screeched a protest. It shook 
as if it were about to fly apart. But 
it held, began to rise, then steadied 
as Rattrack pushed the lever back a 
bit. It fell no further. 

“The elevator,” Zylyphony said, 
shouting to be heard above the 
piercing machine noise of warden 
and chair. “Move it back to the 
elevator.” 

Rattrack’s eyes were wide and 
wild. His face was twisted with des- 
perate indecision, his lips pulled 
back, his teeth bared. “No, the 
map. We need the map!” 

Zylyphony pulled at the back of 
the chair, felt the muscles in her 
neck and belly lock. She forced her 
way up, then forward, the back of 
the chair biting into her ribs. She 
caught a glimpse of a warden pass- 
ing over her head on the low ceil- 
ing. She reached for the controls. 

Rattrack slapped her hand away. 

“Listen, Rattrack.” She made her 
voice calm. “The map goes on 
when someone stands on the floor. 
Do you understand? The floor. 
Look where you’ll have to stand.” 

More wardens were piling into 
the corridor each second, nearly 
blanketing the floor. A few zipped 
along the wall in a brief arc before 
disappearing into the roiling mass. 
Zylyphony felt the heat rising, saw 
Rattrack look down. 

Then they were blinded again as 
the map screen flashed on. 



Zylyphony forced herself to look. 
It was not so painful this time. Rat- 
track was already squinting at the 
map. 

“Reactor,” he said. “See how 
the lines converge at that one 
spot?” ^ 

She tried to think. The buzz of 
the wardens cut through her. She 
stared at the map. There were four 
distinct levels to the city, top to bot- 
tom, from the surface to a level 
below this one. “That’s it,” Rat- 
track said. And yes, she could see 
the spot on the next level down 
where all the lines, green, red, yel- 
low, blue, all came together. It was 
a dome shape nestled at the base of 
the main access tube, their shaft 
from the surface. Red letters across 
the dome said: reactor com- 

plex/central COMP. Did it mean 
something? She was dissolving in 
the heat. 

The pitch of the chair changed, 
became more insistently erratic. 
“The elevator, Rattrack. Now!” 

He nodded. He moved his hands. 
The chair jerked. 

“Back,” she said. “A little to 
the right. Farther. There.” The 
wardens ringed the entrance to the 
elevator, but did not enter. Signs 
flashed on the curved wall, the but- 
tons appeared, and she flung her 
hand at them, not caring which one 
she hit. The elevator creaked and 
jerked, and began its slow descent. 
For a second her eyes were level 
with the gleaming hump-backed 
bodies^of the wardens. Then they 



THE PROLOGUE TO LIGHT 



37 




were gone. 

The elevator rumbled its way 
along its track, groaning as if it 
were the grandfather of all 
machines. It moved much more 
slowly than any reasonable design 
could have called for, stopping 
completely ht times and then start- 
ing up again after a hesitation of 
clanking gears. Clave’s chair was a 
new thing in bad repair, but this 
elevator was old. It felt old. It made 
Zylyphony feel that they were drop- 
ping down through time rather than 
space. She listened to the squeaks 
and clunks as if they were the an- 
swer to a riddle. Why am I here? 
Clank, wheeze — I don’t know. 
Where am I going? I don’t know. 

Rattrack lowered the chair to the 
floor and smiled brightly at 
Zylyphony. “What a battle,’’ he 
said. “What an adventure. We’ll 
take the city and twist it by its 
nose.’’ The elevator lurched and 
then continued down. He laughed 
and kicked the wall. The elevator 
rocked. “Our chariot.’’ 

Clave essayed a grin. Rattrack 
leaned over, grabbing his tunic 
when he tried to twist away. “You 
duddy little fool,’’ he said. “You 
frightened idiot. You could have 
killed us, freezing up like that” He 
slapped Clave across the mouth. 

Zylyphony pushed them apart, 
then hit Rattrack on the nose when 
he reached again for Clave. 
“You’re no better than he is,” she 
said. “Get over there away from 
him. Go on. Go!” 



He turned and sat facing the wall. 
“Just keep that,” motioning at 
Clave, “away from me.” 

She put her hand on Clave’s 
shoulder, saw the tears on his 
cheeks. They sat that way, listening 
to the sounds of the ancient 
machine down through layers of the 
city and minutes of their lives. 

“I’m sorry,” Rattrack said. They 
were both silent. “Look, I don’t 
apologize often, but I said it. What 
more do you want?” The elevator 
shuddered, then went on. “I can’t 
afford to be soft,” he said. “Look 
into your miserable souls and you’ll 
see that I’m doing this for all of us. 
I’m doing it for you.” 

“Be so fuddy careful, Rattrack,” 
Clave said, his voice soft as spun 
cotton. Zylyphony looked at him in 
complete surprise. “Be so fuddy 
careful that you know who’s soul 
needs your help.” 

The elevator stopped. 

There was a door and a silver 
knob set halfway up one side. Rat- 
track pushed at it, then pulled. Noth- 
ing. He tried to slide it to the left 
and the right. “It’s locked.” He 
kicked it. 

Zylyphony walked over and 
pressed her hands against the door, 
fingers curved, palms arched, like 
two clumsy spiders. She rested her 
tight hand on the knob. It was 
warm from Rattrack’s grip. It 
seemed loose. She curled her 
thumb and forefinger around it. 

“No!” It was Clave, standing on 
the seat of the chair. He thrust his 



38 



GALAXY 





scrawny arm toward her, palm up. 
“Don’t. .” 

“Can it be any worse than the 
nightlife?” she said. 

“Yes!” 

She looked at the knob. It almost 
seemed that it wanted to turn. “I 
have to see, Clave. How can we 
know unless we look? How can we 
know that it’s not — ” Paradise. But 
she couldn’t say it. 

* ir ir 

She turned the knob and the door 
swung out without resistance. 

Foul air wafted into the elevator. 
Zylyphony stepped through the 
door, into the smells of decay, the 
pungent odor of urine and feces, the 



silence. She stood on a city street. 

A former city. The street was 
cracked. Many of the walls lining 
the broken sidewalks had crumbled 
and fallen into brash. An odd sort 
of lighting, like firelight, flickered 
on the ruins, danced with the 
shadows. There, a roof had toppled 
nearly intact onto the rubble, flecks 
of blue and gold still clinging to the 
material. There, an entire building 
facade stood, straight as if it were 
built yesterday, but the twisting 
light showed no side walls, no 
back, no roof through the empty 
window. It had been a low and 
spacious city once, with four- and 
five-story buildings and wide court- 
yards. Now the buildings were gut- 
ted or down, the courtyards were 



THE PROLOGUE TO LIGHT 



39 



fragments of loose concrete, and the 
people — 

Clave chugged out of the 
elevator. “It’s so empty,” he said 
in a whisper. 

Rattrack was by her side, appar- 
ently struck as dumb as she. He 
cleared his throat. “The reactor 
complex should be straight ahead if 
the map. .” Zylyphony looked at 
him. “We can’t stop now,” he 
said. “We can’t be sure that it’s all 
like this.” Zylyphony said nothing. 
He went two steps ahead, stopped, 
looked back. He smiled. “Won’t 
you come with me? We’ve come so 
far. I just want to look a little 
farther on.” 

“It’s over,” she said. “There’s 
nothing here. It’s time to go back.” 
She tried to return his smile, tried 
to sound more sincere than she felt. 
“We can go back together.” 

His smile faltered. He looked to 
her left. “Clave?” 

Zylyphony saw a motion from the 
ruins as she turned, just the 
shadows jumping. She saw Clave in 
his chair, his face for once saying 
nothing. He slipped out of the seat 
and stood on the ground by her 
side. “The chair’s yours. Rat- 
track,” he said. “Thank you for it, 
but I don’t think I want it any 
more.” 

Rattrack wet his lips with his 
tongue. “Well,” he said. He 
looked up the broken street, back at 
them. “Well then.” Zylyphony saw 
another movement, was suddenly 
edgy. The shadows? She looked up 



the street at the thin fluttering light. 
Where did it come from? Then Rat- 
track’s good hand tightened in a fist 
and he said, “Well then, damn you. 
Damn you all.” He started up the 
street. 

A cackling laugh burst from the 
shadows. Clave screamed and leaped 
for the chair. Zylyphony spun 
around. And they came. 

She could not count their 
number, it happened too fast. They 
came out of the shadows all at 
once. A few carried torches. Others 
were hunched, naked shapes on the 
fringes of light. Clave had van- 
ished. She saw Rattrack, a circle of 
bodies closing around him. Then 
they were on her. 

Everything was blurred motion 
and fragments. Grunts and squeals 
sounded from all directions. A hand 
gripped her arm and she shook it 
off. A face passed in front of her 
and she saw it like a snapshot, red 
hair and eyes like ruby marbles, 
bone-white skin, lips split down the 
middle by a terrible fissure. She 
kicked out at a motion, barely con- 
nected, but something went sprawl- 
ing across the asphalt. She pushed a 
hand from her shoulder; the fingers 
were fused together in a single 
lump. 

She was pushed and she fell. She 
saw a spear, a leg bone filed to a 
point. Huge hands clamped her 
arms to her sides, lifted her from 
the ground. She saw Rattrack go 
down under the tumult of bodies, 
and she screamed, “Rattrack!” 



40 



GALAXY 




She heard her captor’s voice, 
loud and deep. “Rackpleck,” it 
said. Its breath was thick and pu- 
trid. Her stomach heaved. 
“Rackpleck,” she heard, “Rack- 
pleck,” the distorted word pass- 
ing from mouth to mouth in 
growls and squeaks. “Rackpleck, 
Rackpleck, RackpleckRackpleck- 
Rackpleck,” and they were carry- 
ing her down the street, running so 
that the torches dimmed, their heads 
of fire swept back by the wind. 
‘ ‘RackpleckRackpleckRackpleck, ’ ’ 
until her brain no longer accepted 
the sound, no longer translated what 
she saw into meaning. She knew 
nothing but the jolts and bumps, 
and even these seemed as far away 
as a memory. 

The light brought her back to 
thinking again, a steady white light 
that slowly grew brighter. The only 
sounds were the footfalls of her cap- 
tor and his wheezing with every 
step. Silence, after a fashion. She 
twisted around to see where she was 
being taken, and he casually 
punched her between the shoulder 
blades. 

The light became so bright that 
her eyes watered, and then she was 
thrown down, bruising her elbow on 
the rough, broken flagstones of the 
courtyard. She crawled a few paces 
away on her hands and knees to- 
ward the hill of light, then stopped. 
Where was she going? Courtyard? 
The place smelled of urine and the 
stones were sticky. She sat up, tried 
to arrange the pictures in order, any 

THE PROLCX5UE TO LIGHT 



sort of order. 

Yes, it was a courtyard, a plaza 
of great cracked stones. The hill of 
light was a dome, a vast glowing 
arc, perfect and untouched in the 
middle of the ruined courtyard. The 
gleaming cylinder of the access 
shaft rose from its base to reach for 
the ceiling. 

A sound, a footstep, and she 
whirled around on all fours. The 
huge creature took another step, and 
she backed away, dragging herself 
on her palms. The monster stopped. 
It was nearly two and a half meters 
tall, with blunt features, a cleft lip, 
skewed nostrils, and brilliant blue 
eyes. She pictured Rattrack walking 
up, slapping it on the thigh, saying 
in that proud cynical way, “Our 
chariot.” A giggle escaped her lips. 
The monster stooped, sat on the 
stones with legs out straight, arms 
as braces behind its back. Her 
back? The bulges on that mountain 
of flesh could be breasts. 

Suddenly he-she-it whipped its 
hands forward, clapped them once, 
and flung them back before it could 
lose balance. The mouth twisted, 
smiled. “Rackpleck,” it said. 

Rackpleck. Reactor Complex. 
Zylyphony began to laugh. She 
clutched her stomach, doubled over 
with hysterical, heaving sobs of 
laughter without knowing why, ex- 
cept for the coincidence of names. 

Which was no reason. She 
stopped, ran her hands across the 
rough stone, waiting for the trem- 
bling to leave her. The giant had 



41 




stood, was walking toward the ac- 
cess chute, its back to her. She 
looked over her shoulder at the 
dome and saw an inscription across 
its surface in dark letters, halfway 
up the side: the citizens are the 

HEART OF THt CITY. 

There was a group of infants and 
very young children at the base of 
the access tube, too distant for her 
to see any details other than an oc- 
casional flash of white skin. Others 
were coming into the courtyard 
now. A dwarf hobbled past on club 
feet, holding a white bone spear in 
one white hand and a torch in the 
other, the flickering flame-blossom 
dancing beside a thatch of red hair. 
A woman with no visible deformity 
other than a split lip went by look- 
ing tired and. young, in a badly 
worn sort of way. They all had that 
quality of ruined youth, ageless at 
first glance until the eye could sepa- 
rate the child eyes and smooth skin 
from the stoop and shuffle. And 
aside from this, and aside from the 
common deformities, the albinism, 
the dwarfism, the fused digits, the 
split lips, they all bore a look of 
sameness. It was a similarity of fa- 
cial structure, a line of profile, that 
linked even her blue-eyed giant and 
the red-eyed, white-skinned dwarf, 
as if they were all somehow related, 
all of the same family. 

Many of the women were preg- 
nant, and some of these went to 
collect infants from the group by 
the access shaft. Zylyphony saw 
one woman clucking and repeatedly 



pressing a bundle to her breast, 
though it was motionless. She heard 
a scream of rage and saw a woman 
rush at the albino dwarf. He kept 
her at a distance with the point of 
his spear, chattering with fear and 
anger until she backed away, bleed- 
ing from a dozen pinpricks. One of 
the older men, eyes the same blue 
as her captor, came over to her and 
bent his head with curiosity. He 
reached a lumped hand toward her 
face, then pulled back when she 
flinched. “Nah hort,” he said, and 
walked away. No hurt? 

A group approached the courtyard 
sharing some heavy burden. They 
dropped it on the stones a short dis- 
tance from Zylyphony and went on 
their way. It was Rattrack. She pat- 
ted his face and he blinked awake, 
looked at her, at the milling crowd 
in the courtyard and by the access 
tube, at the dome. 

“I’ve found it,” he said. 

Zylyphony heard a thud. A knot 
of people gathered around an open- 
ing at the base of the access tube 
and pulled out a limp bundle com- 
pletely swathed in thin white ban- 
dages. The dwarf sliced through the 
covering with his spear, dug and 
hacked and finally came away with 
two fist-sized chunks of red meat. 
He handed one of them to a child 
on the floor and sat on his haunches 
a few steps away, gnawing hungrily 
at his prize. Others elbowed their 
way into the crowd, all pushing and 
clawing for a place by the corpse. 

Her paradise.

She felt Rattrack’s hand groping 
for her arm, holding her as he 
pulled himself up. “What are 
they?” he said. His face was pale, 
his throat working as he swallowed. 
“What sort of creatures. ?” 

By the corpse stood her personal 
giant, its mouth smeared with dry- 
ing blood. It smiled at her. Then, 
with a sweep of one huge hand, it 
swept the others out of the way, 
picked up the mutilated bundle, and 
started toward her. The entire popu- 
lation followed, the ones who had 
not yet fed clawing frantically at the 
stained bandages held above their 
reach, and the others fanning out so 
that she and Rattrack found them- 
selves with their backs against the 
dome. 

Rattrack turned and hammered 
against the glowing curved wall 
with his fist. The surface absorbed 
the blows and even the sound of the 
blows as if he were hitting solid 
stone. Zylyphony was only tired. It 
was a supreme effort for her to lift 
her hand to his shoulder, to say, 
“It’s all right.” 

He whirled around, staring at the 
approaching shapes as if she weren’t 
there. “No,” he howled at them. 
Then he ran at one woman in the 
semi-circle, kicked her feet from 
under her, punched her as she fell, 
and stood in challenge, waiting for 
the battle. 

They all stopped. Some of them 
looked around in confusion. The 
group surrounding the giant had 
given up on their meal and simply 



waited sullenly. Not one of them 
looked directly at Rattrack or made 
a move in his direction. The woman 
he had felled whimpered and crawled 
away from his feet. He dropped his 
hands to his sides and the killing 
expression left his face. 

The giant took a step toward 
Zylyphony. It smiled and threw the 
bundle to her feet. She closed her 
eyes. There was nothing left inside 
of her, no hope, no disgust, no 
pain, nothing but the faint and fleet- 
ing wish that she could bend down 
and take her share of this gift. She 
was hollow. She forced herself to 
look at the creature, to nod, to say 
through numb lips, “Thank you, 
but no. Nah.” She shook her head. 

“Nah?” It looked at her quizzi- 
cally and took another step forward. 
She held our her hand to. what? 
To halt? To beckon? To ask for 
something that she could not have? 
And what did it matter? 

A scream and a rumble shattered 
the quiet, and out of the shadows of 
the ruined buildings came Clave in 
his chair, shrieking so that even see- 
ing him, Zylyphony was afraid. He 
passed above their heads, a sonic 
catastrophe of human lungs and tor- 
tured metal, then banked the chair 
high and came in for another pass. 
The assemblage vanished. Some ran 
while others hobbled or carried the 
infarhs, but they vanished and were 
gone into the ruins before Clave had 
come around. Her hand was still out 
when the machine landed between 
her and Rattrack.

Clave jumped from the seat and 
stood there preening. Rattiack 
walked over and clapped him on the 
shoulder. “Fine work,” he said. 
“Just in time.” 

Clave looked at her. She nearly 
turned away, hut she saw the 
brightness of his eyes, his statKe, 
and she said, “Yes, thank you. 
Clave. Just in time.” He looked 
down. A bit of the air went out of 
him. Had she sounded so bad? 

Rattrack motioned at the chair. 
“You’ve earned it now. It’s 
yours.” 

Clave licked his lips, shook Rat- 
track’s hand off his shoulder. He 
seemed acutely embarrassed, nearly 
stuttering as he said. “No, Rat- 
track. I don’t want it. It isn’t 
mine.” He sat on an upcropping of 
stone with his back to them. “Just 
because you’re looking so hard for 
something doesn’t make you bigger 
than me,” he said. 

Without a word, his jaw working, 
Rattrack went to the remains of the 
corpse and lifted it, almost tenderly. 
He carried it toward the access 
chute. Zyly phony went with him. 
She had some idea of trying to ex- 
plain, of stopping him, but words 
were too much. A restraining hand 
on his arm would be too much. She 
could only walk along and watch as 
he leaned through the opening in 
the side of the tall cylinder, pried 
away the makeshift platfoim of 
wood and metal scraps, and let 
them drop along with the body. 
Seconds later they heard a soft, dis- 



tant splash. 

Rattrack returned to the dome 
while she walked more slowly, 
passing by Clave as if in a dream. 
Rattrack was searching for an en- 
trance when she reached him. He 
had found a short line of symbols 
on the glowing surface and was 
pressing them in various combina- 
tions, trying to pull at them, cajol- 
ing them beneath his breath. 

The people were coming back to 
the courtyard, moving about at ran- 
dom, ignoring the visitors. A few 
went over to the access tube, looked 
through the opening, and began to 
murmur among themselves. Others 
wandered over and the murmur be- 
came a hubbub of angry chatter. 
There were glances at Clave and the 
empty chair. The dwarf and a few 
others began moving toward him. 
The crowd swelled as it ap- 
proached. 

Zylyphony took a step away from 
the dome. “Clave?” She had spo- 
ken too softly. She cleared her 
throat. “Clave!” Too loud. He 
jerked his head around. “Come 
over here.” 

He stood then and saw the ring of 
faces. They hesitated, and resumed 
their cautious advance. The dwarf 
ran forward, motioning with his 
spear, then skipped back into the 
pack. He ran out again, coming a 
little closer this time. 

Clave backstepped. The crowd 
surged forward. He turned to run, 
tripped on the uneven surface, went 
down. There was a sound behind 



44 



GALAXY 




Zylyphony, a rush of cooler air. A 
wedge had slid open on the side of 
the dome. She saw Rattrack poised 
at the opening, a glimpse of intri- 
cate machinery and lights, like an 
electronic hive. Then Clave was 
gone, covered over by a swirl of 
bodies, kicking feet, descending 
fists. The dwarf danced about, 
played at plunging down the spear. 

And Zylyphony was running, 
screaming, throwing herself into the 
sea of flesh. She fell on top of 
Clave. He was curled into a ball, 
his eyes closed. She was pulled 
away. The circle closed again. She 
saw Rattrack at the opening to the 
dome, his foot lifted to step inside, 
his face turned toward her, straining 
in two directions at once like an 
acrobat executing an awkward-seem- 
ing trick of balance. 

Then he ran for the chair. The 
dome closed behind him. He was in 
the seat, up, speeding at them, the 
chair rumbling like the thunder of 
Armageddon. 

Few ran this time. They cowered 
as the chair rushed over their heads, 
but stood their ground. The dwarf 
held the spear at his shoulder, 
cocked his arm. The chair banked, 
came around low, started back. The 
spear flew. 

Rattrack brushed past Zylyphony 
and cut through the fringes of the 
group like a dull scythe. Bodies 
scattered like mowed grass. The rest 
fled now, some for the shadows, 
but most toward the access chute 
where they gathered to watch and

wait. The chair came around for a 
third pass, came around, slowed, 
and stopped in the air by 
Zylyphony. Rattrack smiled. He 
leaned forward and looked sur- 
prised. His injured hand went to the 
spear in his side* pinning him to the 
back of the chair. His other hand 
was on the controls, and when he 
slumped over, the chair sank to the 
floor. 

Zylyphony dragged Clave to the 
chair, tugged and hefted until she 
had maneuvered the dead weight 
onto Rattrack’s lap. She felt a burn- 
ing at her eyes and throat, but tears 
and acceptance were equally impos- 
sible. She sat on the arm of the 
chair, legs dangling over the side, 
and started up. The controls were 
simple and she had seen them used 
often enough. The chair grumbled, 
bucked so that she had to hold onto 
Clave to keep them both from being 
thrown, and rose hesitant into the 
air. She rode toward the access 
shaft. 

The chair was sluggish, and 
moved forward slowly. The giant 
stood at the head of the crowd by 
the chute. It stepped aside as she 
came up, no expression on that mis- 
shapen face, no sound from its 
mouth. Zylyphony looked straight 
ahead, feeling like a ghost as she 
drifted past. A path opened through 
the crowd as she went on, each face 
sliding by the periphery of her 
sight, those to her left lit by the 
dome, and the others cast in 
shadow. There was nothing grand in 



this escape, nothing sharpened by 
fine meaning or exultation. The 
faces passed, one by one, the red 
eyes, the blue eyes, the split 
mouths, each quiet and still and at 
their own sort of repose. Then the 
chair was in the chute, straining, 
vibrating, rising like a bubble in 
heavy oil until the smells were gone 
from the air and the light of the 
dome was far behind. 

For a long time she heard nothing 
but Rattrack’s labored, uneven breath- 
ing. She touched his brow once; it 
was cold and damp. She thought 
Clave might be dead, but did not 
have the strength or courage to see. 
Eventually, it seemed like hours but 
must have been no more than fif- 
teen minutes, he stirred, groaned, 
began to shift around. She grabbed 
his arm. 

“What. ?” 

“Be careful,” she said. “Rat- 
track’s hurt. We’re in the air.” 

He was quiet for a moment, then 
edged his way carefully from Rat- 
track’s lap to the other arm of the 
chair. She heard him hiss with pain 
as he twisted around. 

“Are you badly hurt?” 

He was silent as if considering. 
“No, Just shaky little pains.” 
Another moment, another meter 
toward the surface. Time and dis- 
tance seemed interchangeable here. 
“How’s Rattrack?” 

“Dying, I think.” Silence. They 
passed a glowing blue spot on the 
wall, the entrance to the works 
level. 



46 



GALAXY 




“I didn’t have to save you back 
there, did I?” he said. “They 
weren’t bad. You wouldn’t have 
been hurt.’’ 

“No.” 

Rattrack groaned, began to 
squirm. His breathing became 
heavier. She patted his cheek, felt 
him come awake. 

“Zylyphony?” 

“Yes.” 

He coughed. “Is Clave. ...” 
“I’m over here, Rattrack.” 

He relaxed. His breathing became 
more even. She thought he had fal- 
len asleep and put her hand lightly 
on his shoulder. It was very dark. 
She wished she could see. 

Suddenly he twisted around and 
pulled at the monstrous thorn in his 
side. He held the pose for perhaps 
ten seconds, endless seconds, then 
slumped back. “I can’t. ...” He 
stmggled for breath. “Damn city! 
Scuddy damn. ...” 

She and Clave said nothing for 
the rest of the trip. The circle 
opened above them as they reached 
the underside of the street, and they 
came out into the dark city, the 
night city, the steel avenue, the 
black buildings, all terribly un- 
changed. 

The two of them climbed from 
the chair. Clave turned back, stood 
on tiptoes to work the controls and 
maneuver the machine over the 
hole. He jiggled the lever and the 
chair began to drop with its burden, 
slowly, slowly, until it was gone. 
“Maybe they’ll catch it,” he 



said. “It’s going slinky slow.” The 
street closed without a sound, with- 
out a mark. He sat crosslegged by 
the place and closed his eyes. 

She wanted to sit with him. She 
wanted to never see him again. She 
walked away, stopped, walked a 
few steps farther. There was some- 
thing on the side of a building, a 
patch of light that shouldn’t be 
there. She went for a closer look. 

* « * 

It was an open door. 

For the first time that night she 
found herself truly terrified. There 
was no reason for this door, no un- 
derstanding it. The city never made 
mistakes. The city never forgave. 
These were rules of life. Rattrack 
had been wrong; the city was 
a thing, only a thing. She felt herself 
pulled forward and looked inside. 
There were none of the proper ele- 
ments of horror here, no shadowy 
movements, no sudden sounds. It 
was a well-lit apartment-building 
corridor leading to an open lobby, 
plush and quiet, no one in sight. 
Faint lilting music came from the 
distance. It was horrible. She 
wanted no part of it and it sucked 
her in. She stepped over the 
threshold, expecting each second 
that the door would shut her out and 
the city would shake with laughter. 
But that was Rattrack’s game. The 
city didn’t care. It was impossible. 

This was impossible. 

She was inside. She stopped. 



THE PROLOGUE TO LIGHT

standing a bit wobbly on the 
cushioned floor. She touched a wall 
and felt velvet. It was too much. 
The silence laced with music was 
too much. She turned. The door had 
closed. She flung herself against it, 
pounded with her fists. It would not 
open. 

There were footsteps, light and 
muffled. She whirled around and saw 
a woman coming toward her, re- 
gally graceful, wearing a long 
shimmering blue gown. She pushed 
herself away from the door, sur- 
prised that her body did not trem- 
ble. 

The woman stopped a few paces 
away, made the gesture of wel- 
come, smiled. “It’s so late,” she 
said. “I could hardly believe it 
when I heard we had a new tenant, 
but here you are. Isn’t it exciting? 
Isn’t it wonderful? Such stories 
you’ll have. I haven’t been so ex- 
cited in, in. well, I just don’t 
know how long. How do you like 
your new house? It’s a fine house, 
you’ll see. All the fixtures were de- 
signed by Grata. ...” and on and 
on, the games room, the conveni- 
ences, deafening inanities, mon- 
strous inconsequentials all. 

And to her horror, Zylyphony 
found herself smiling and replying 
in kind. 

The woman in blue motioned. 
“Well come right along this way. 
Your room is just lovely. I think 
it’s a blue one. Blue is such a 
lovely color, don’t you think?” She 
laughed musically. “Now why are 



you crying, dear? Have a chew. It’s 
going to be a lovely day.” 

* * ■* 

Clave saw Zylyphony go inside, 
saw the door snap shut. He looked 
at the building, looked at the street 
by his side. He stood. He couldn’t 
do anything. He wasn’t good for 
anything but watching and listening. 
When he tried to do something, it 
came out all fuddy wrong, and he’d 
tried. He’d tried down in the old 
city when he felt different and went 
to save them, and it had come out 
wrong then. He was always the 
same. He was a bad one. He felt 
different still, but that must be 
wrong too. 

He smoothed down his tunic. The 
sky was beginning to turn from 
charcoal to dark gray. There wasn’t 
much time. He started down the 
street toward the northwest hidy- 
hole. It would be nearest. 

A light flashed out of a side 
street and he froze. The Troller 
came around the corner, pinned him 
in the spotlight, and rode up. 

“What have we here? A scuddy 
little rodent out after bedtime? 
Should I wrap you up, rodent? No, 
I think I’ll follow right behind you 
all the way back to your hidy-hole, 
and maybe I’ll let you make it and 
maybe I won’t. Go on, little pest. 
It’s a long walk and I might make 
up my mind any time.” 

The light wasn’t so bad. He 
could look over it and see the out- 



48 



GALAXY 




lines of the man and the chair. Here 
was something fuddy strange: The 
chair was just a chair, and the man 
just a man. 

“That’s enough time,” the Trol- 
ler said. He swung the muzzle of 
the roper around. “Walk.” 

“I know a secret,” said Clave. 
“I don’t know much but I watch 
and I listen and I know two things. 
Do you want to hear?” 

The finger hesitated above the 
trigger. 

“It’s bad when you don’t know 
what something is. It’s bad when 
you think it’s something only it’s 
not. It sounds funny but listen. I 
know what people are, and I know 
what people aren’t. That’s the two 
things. Oh, it’s so fuddy easy.” He 
touched his chest and spoke very 
slowly and clearly. “1 am a per- 
son.” He pointed past the light. 
“You are a person. All of them,” 
sweeping his hand in a great arc, 
“are people.” He was delighted 
with himself. He was going to get it 
right! 

“But here’s the other half of the 
trick,” he said. He walked up and 
patted the chair. “This isn’t people, 
it’s too hard.” He leaned down to 
pat the satin street. “And this isn’t 
people, it’s too straight.” He 
looked up into the light, smiling. 
“Try it,” he said. “It’s easy. 
There’s oh so much that isn’t 
people, and there’s oh so much that 
is.” 

The Troller was motionless. Fi- 
nally he whispered, “If I don’t take 




you, someone else will.” He tight- 
ened his grip on the trigger, then 
drew back. “Get on to the hidy- 
hole,” he said. “Get on now.” He 
spun the chair around and raced off. 

Clave watched him go, then 
looked up at the graying city dome. 
The city was still fuddy dark, and 
quieter now between times than in 
the middle of the night. He felt sad, 
sad and fine all at once. He 
couldn’t understand it, but there it 
was, and he started down the street, 
the hard plastic soles of his shoes 
slapping (another Troller called off 
to someone in the distance), slapping 
the long steel avenue of the city at 
dawn. ★

LAST CONTACT 




On A CLEAR November night in 
1974, a three-minute message from 
the entire human race was transmit- 
ted from the radio-telescopic instal- 
lation at Arecibo, Puerto Rico. At 
this very moment, that message 
continues to pierce the Universe at 
near light speed. Who knows its 
content or consequences? 

* * * 

Snorflapp plied his ship between 
the stars, whistling a gay and 
snappy tune. He had good reason to 
be happy; the gods were on his 
side, the odds in his favor. As 
Snorflapp watched the blue and 
white body, third major mass of a 
yellow star grow in his simuvisor, he 
marveled at his good fortune: It 
was certain that the signals had 
originated from this close-at-tip 
source. Twining a gray, middle- 
aged tentacle around the computer's 
gripper, Snorflapp initiated a de- 
tailed canvassing of the planet's 
physical parameters. 

He knew he had the Jump on his 
competitors. According to the 
well-known sociological axiom: 
“An isolated society that has re- 
cently become capable of radiating 
energy along the hydrogen band is a 
society eager for plasma-form fu- 
sion.” The inhabitants of this world 
would, in all probability, be dying 
to find a controllable form of fusion 
energy. If Snorflapp completed one 
more sale, his alimony would be 
canceled forever; sufficient excuse 



for musical delight. But his whis- 
tling had a further purpose: Snor- 
flapp was nervous. 

The present situation was disturb- 
ingly similar to his first contact 
mission, many years ago. The cir- 
cumstances had been ordinary 
enough then too: a standard signal 
received, a standard reply returned: 
“Thank you for your kind interest. 
Unfortunately, due to relativistic 
wrinkles, I am unable to arrive at 
this time. However, a quick glance 
at my schedule shows that I will be 
in your area very soon. Perhaps 
then we can get together and com- 
pare life forms. Looking forward to 
our meeting, Snorflapp Can- 
druthers.” 

How exhilarated he had been! 
How anticipatory! And then the in- 
habitants had obliterated themselves 
before Snorflapp could arrive. He 
had tried not to take it personally. 

Waiting for the canvasser's re- 
port, Snorflapp resolved that this 
time there would be no mash-ups. 
His ship was equipped with the very 
latest concept translators. He could 
penetrate the Communication Bar- 
rier with little or no malapropism. 
His static shield was guaranteed to 
protect him, should the natives 
prove to be anything less than 
civilized. And, of course, the usual 
social quirks were to be expected — 
taboos against the public passage of 
gastric gases, for example — but 
Snorflapp, like all contact-agents, 
was a graduate of the Leinster 
School, albeit a late one. He was.

51 




therefore, mentally limber, capable 
of absorbing most forms of cultural 
shock, and adept at avoiding deal- 
ing out any of his own. Unfortu- 
nately, there was no guarantee, 
shield, or method that completely 
obviated most embracing of all in- 
terphase problems: Terrified natives. 

Past contact missions had only 
been able to discover cultures that 
were far less civilized than 
Snorflapp’s; and more than half of 
these had quickly fallen victim to 
mass panic and consequent social 
disruption. Suspicion was a Con- 
tactor’s primary enemy, but it was 
also his greatest friend: it separated 
the conscientious agent from the 
fumbler, the clever from the dull, 
the quick from the dead. It put zing 
in the profession and made space 
taste tangy. 

Snorflapp resumed his whistling 
and scanned the concluding report 
on the planet’s conditions. The 
gravity was acceptable. The atmos- 
pheric pressure and toxicity at sur- 
face: Correctable. Unclassified or- 
ganisms at selected site: Three 
hundred and fourteen. Hazardous 
bio-organisms at selected site: Un- 
known. Total Survival Factor: 
- 1 - 730 . 

Not bad, Snorflapp thought. He 
prepared for the impact of descent. 
If all goes well. I’ll be home in 
time to catch the last half of the 
third mating cycle. Won’t Grizzle- 
guts be surprised? 

Occupied with memories of 
amorous triumphs, Snorflapp for- 



tified his psyche while the ship 
gravitated through the spinning 
planet’s soft, silky shell. Directional 
controls had located the signal’s 
origin site, a tiny landmass nestled 
below a jagged continent. Grum- 
bling dully, kicking up gusts of grit 
and dust, the ship settled into a cra- 
ter of remarkably regular dimen- 
sions. 

* * * 

Snorflapp twisted his posterior 
tentacles, anxiously watching the 
exterior screens. There were neither 
weapons nor welcome. Perhaps the 
inhabitants had gone mad and killed 
one another after having received a 
reply to their message. Snorflapp 
shuddered. That was silly. Such a 
thing couldn’t happen to him twice; 
nobody’s luck was that abominable. 
Probably the natives were just hid- 
ing, waiting for him to show his 
colors. A common enough reaction. 

Snorflapp waited. The coolant 
system frosted his craft’s outer hull, 
causing an occasional ping. 

A triangular series of cables, 
which formerly had spanned the cra- 
ter and been tautly attached to a 
rim-encircling network of towers, 
was now snarled and tangled in the 
ship’s projections. A heavy, metal- 
lic artifact lay at an angle, not far 
away, half-buried in the crater’s 
gentle slope. Both the cable and the 
artifact begged intelligent construc- 
tors, but none were in evidence. 
Snorflapp sighed, his anxiety in- 



52 



GALAXY 




creasing. They were making it 
tough for him; he would have to 
leave the ship. 

Then, at the crater’s crest, a 
brightly colored artifact came into 
view, descending slowly around a 
spiral path toward Snorflapp. It 
wound its way down the crater, 
trailing a wake of white and brown 
exhaust, gradually nearing. When at 
last it arrived, a tiny, oddly shaped 
organism emerged and proceeded to 
toss bits of surface matter against 
the chilled hull. This added to the 
rippling tattoo. 

Snorflapp peered with interest at 
the image on his screens. The crea- 
ture was biped, the size of a new- 
born child. It clutched a fuming ob- 
ject in its — according to the ship’s 
analysis — mouth. Hopefully, the 

wisps of smoke had little relevance 
to the org’s mode of communica- 
tion. They would be hard to mimic. 

The concept translator quickly 
scanned the local, low-level elec- 
tromagnetic waves, seeking a matrix 
of symbols compatible with the 
bipeder’s physiology and/or in- 
telligence. Slowly, with great enun- 
ciation, Snorflapp said, “Saluta- 
tions,” and watched the screen 
while the ship translated the concept 
into the inhabitant’s language. 

“Buenos dias, ” the outer speaker 
bellowed. The sound was perplex- 
ing, yet faintly pleasant. Snorflapp 
hoped the bipeder found its meaning 
clear and its tone appealing. “My 
name is Snorflapp Candruthers. I 
am from the planetary mass existing 



beyond — ^how do you say it — ^Tau 
Ceti?” 

The bipeder made no move. Ap- 
parently, it knew no fear. 

“I bring you peace and good 
will,” Sno^app continued. “I know 
that my words are difficult to com- 
prehend. Please try. What is this 
place known as?” 

“Esta es Arecibo," the creature 
answered. The concept translator re- 
layed the information as: “This is 
Arecibo.” 

Snorflapp chuckled with glee, 
and became alarmed when his de- 
light was immediately translated 
into a bubbling wail. Fortunately, 
the bipeder continued to stand its 
ground. “It pleases me,” Snorflapp 
hastily amended, “to be here on the 
planet, Arecibo. What are you 
known as?” 

“I am called Angel Santiago, sir, 
and this planet is not called 
Arecibo. It is called Earth. Arecibo 
is the name of the installation that 
your ship has scorched and tangled. 
I work here.” 

“Ah, it is you who controls the 
signals?” 

“It is I who controls the sanita- 
tion. But now that you and the 
Japanese alien have arrived. ...” 
The creature expressively raised its 
upper appendages, “I guess I won’t 
be working here any more.” 

“I’m sorry,” Snorflapp said, 
tapping his translator. “I didn’t get 
all that. You said something about 
a . Japanese alien?” 

“Are you a friend of his?” 



LAST CONTACT

“Whose?” 

“The Japanese alien. Have you 
come to take him home?” 

Snorflapp’s juices increased their 
circulation. “Am I to under- 
stand,” he said, “that there is 
another Contactor on this planet, 
this Earth? Another, like myself?” 

“1 don’t know if he’s like you 
or not,” Santiago complained. “I 
don’t even know what you look 
like; there’s an alien in Japan, that’s 
all. The scientists are there now, in- 
specting him. They left me here 
with instructions to strip, wax and 
buff the halls while they’re away.” 
He tossed his fuming object to the 
planet’s surface and covered it 
forcefully with one of his peds. 

“Incr^ible,” Snorflapp whis- 
pered. “I realize that considerable 
time has elapsed since I replied to 
your message, but — You did get 
my reply to your message, didn’t 
you?” 

The bipeder blinked. “That was 
you?” 

An awesome concept was moving 
toward Snorflapp. It was moving 
with the accelerating gravity of a 
dark singularity. What if — as San- 
tiago seemed to intimate — what if 
this routine contact mission were 
to erupt into a major historical 
event? What if this were the long- 
awaited, oft-hoped-for encounter 
with beings of an equal or superior 
culture? What if this were the op- 
portunity, at long last, to meet 
one’s equal; to iris the entrance to 
new knowledge, new experiences. 



new positions? The very whisper of 
the thought with its attendant prom- 
ise of status and personal reward 
sent Snorflapp’s mind a-staggering. 

He could become a glittering, 
system-wide celebrity. And, with 
fame would come wealth; enough 
wealth to buy a new vessel. 
GAWK! What was he thinking? 
He’d be able to purchase an entire 
planetoid, establish a mining con- 
cern, and live the rest of his life in 
luxury. He’d do talk shows, in- 
scribe his experiences in the univer- 
sal databank, have that delicate and 
expensive operation that was sup- 
posed to put zing back into your 
tentacles and blow the flugg from 
the folds of your neck. All. All 
would be Snorflapp’s if he could 
contact, in outer space, life as he 
knew it. 

And then the singularity collapsed 
upon itself. 

What if this were only some rene- 
gade Contactor trying to hustle a 
piece of Snorflapp’s territory? What 
if some clever slipper had managed 
to bleed Snorflapp’s communicator, 
rechart the coordinates, and arrive 
on this planet ahead of schedule? 

Snorflapp questioned the inhabit- 
ant closely. “Tell me all you know 
of this other alien. He arrived a 
short time ago?” 

“Recently,” Angel Santiago an- 
swered. “I’ve never seen him, re- 
member, but I’m a close friend of 
the scientists. They confide with 
me, and I get my information from 
the horse’s mouth, so to say.”

GALAXY 




“Yes, yes,” Snorflapp inter- 
rupted. “Was there any mention of 
fusion or fission? Has the alien tried 
to sell you anything? A plasma- 
form fusion unit?” 

Angel Santiago paused to scratch 
his upper surface. “There’s been a 
lot of talk of nuclear energy, if 
that’s what you mean,” he said. “1 
think someone spoke of plasma 
particles — ” 

Snorflapp cut him off. “Where 
can I find this alien? Direct me, 
please.” 

“I doubt that it will do you much 
good, sir,” Santiago gestured, cryp- 
tically. “The Japanese are very up- 
set. They envision a crushed and 
ravaged Tokyo and hate all 
monsters, in general, sir.” 

“Monsters?” 

“It was all the scientists here 
could do to secure a promise that 
the alien wouldn’t be exterminated 
until after they had arrived for an 
interview.” 

“Exterminated?” Snorflapp 
shrieked in panic. “Where? Where 
is this Japanese area? Tell me at 
once.” 

* * * 

Igman-Luy tore at a cluster of 
kobuku trees, tilted his head upward 
to hiss at his captors, and thumped 
his tail in exasperation. He paced a 
tight circle in the shallow, confining 
valley, searching for some way past 
the ring of savages and their painful 
flaming weapons. 



Escape was impossible. It was 
the thin atmosphere that was most 
fatal; Igman-Luy struggled to catch 
his breath. He fell to the ground. 
Exhausted. 

First the explosive landing, then 
the panic-filled moments flounder- 
ing in this planet’s icy liquid, and 
finally the persecution. His name 
would be recorded in the lists of 
those lost in the mysterious triangu- 
lar sector. He would die in the 
hands of these little, fear-crazed 
creatures, with their inquisitive, 
childlike minds and their flimsy, 
filthy habitats and their portable 
flame weapons. And, after he was 
dead, they would dissect his corpse, 
scooping and scraping, poking and 
tearing, inspecting every organ, test- 
ing every tissue, mastering their 
fear by disassembling the feared. 

Was it any wonder that Igman- 
Luy had run screaming through the 
eastern section of Osaka? No, the 
wonder was that the despicable na- 
tives had failed to empathize or 
even recognize his perfectly under- 
standable pain-flight, that they had 
pursued, attacked, herded him into 
this enclosure in the planet’s sur- 
face, surrounded him with an ever- 
tightening cordon of the pale in- 
habitants, who were now edging 
forward, their dreaded armaments 
a-sizzle. 

On a lost planet of an inconse- 
quential star, light-years from any 
shipping lane, Igman-Luy looked 
Death squarely in the eye and re- 
fused to flinch. It is to his credit

that, as much as the atmospheric 
conditions would allow, he held his 
muzzle high. 

Which is why he was the first to 
see the speck. 

The mob was busy preparing it- 
self for one final consumptive blast 
when the spetk of light appeared on 
the horizon. With a shrill, whirring 
urgency, it streaked closer, swerv- 
ing to avoid a symmetrical, snow- 
capped volcano. Igman fancied he 
saw a ship of interstellar design, 
and his hearts leaped. 

His persecutors dropped their 
weapons. As if caught in a terrible 
wind, some fled madly over the en- 
circling ridge, while others hid 
among the foliage. Igman stood 
abandoned at the bottom of the val- 
ley, like the eye of an enormous 
target. 

it it 'k 

Even as his ship came over the 
horizon, Snorflapp had spied the 
pack of bipeders. They were swarm- 
ing into an impression in the 
planet’s crust, actively constructing 
a circle of fire around a large, ochre 
and green form. The canvasser re- 
ported that the form was an or- 
ganism incongruous to this world. 
Further analysis indicated the odd 
org’s basic life systems were in 
jeopardy. 

Snorflapp landed and watched the 
inhabitants scatter. Ignoring per- 
sonal safety, he twisted a tentacle 
through the exit gripper, punching 



out the proper code. He shouted a 
warning, telling the throng, which 
had begun to creep back, to stand 
clear of his static shield. The iris 
dilated, the protective enclosure 
coalesced, and Snorflapp was out. 

The natives seemed not to under- 
stand. He watched with concern as 
they stumbled up the hillside. After 
a cursory inspection of their dis- 
carded instruments, it became clear 
that their intent had been to reduce 
the alien to a heap of smoldering 
residue. 

Snorflapp grimaced and ap- 
proached the huddled, dappled 
“monster.” He had never encoun- 
tered anything like it before. Osten- 
sibly, it was reptilian, yet its optic 
structures were multifaceted. Its 
breath was labored. Its pulse was 
fluttering. The crackling brush fires 
gleamed off its pebbled surface. 
Near exhaustion, too weary to re- 
flect any emotion save pain and 
fear, the creature shivered in 
Snorflapp’s shadow, rippling its 
colorful hide, exuding infinite suf- 
fering and a touch of delirium. 

Snorflapp telemetered his ship, 
ordered it to analyze the creature 
and enable him to establish a rap- 
port with it. Moments later, he was 
announcing: “Salutations. My name 
is Snorflapp Candruthers of the 
planetary body existing beyond — 
how do you know it — Rosanosphro? 
I sympathize with your suffering. 
Do you comprehend my meaning?” 

The scaled being shuddered. 
“Save yourself. Flee if you can.”

GALAXY 




The crowd began to rumble and 
draw courage. 

“Stay back,” Snorfl^p shouted 
to the crowd, employing the 
Arecibo matrix. The natives ap- 
peared startled and confused, as if 
they couldn’t understand. Fleet- 
ingly, Snorflapp suspected there had 
been a dialect shift between here 
and Arecibo, but he was too busy 
with the expiring alien to worry 
about minor mash-ups. Directing his 
words at the polka-dotted dragon, 
he asked: ‘ ‘Who are you?’ ’ 

Slowly, laboriously, came the 
reply; “I am Igman-Luy of an 
expanding cloud many years 
hence ... I came riding an in- 
terstellar wind ... a wave of high- 
intensity neutrinos tore my en- 
velope. I fell, nearly shattered, spill- 
ing into this planet’s liquid terrain. 
Death all but overtook me before I 
could struggle to a solid surface. 
Since that time, 1 have been pur- 
sued and persecuted unto death. 

Conflicting emotions plucked at 
Snorflapp’s conscience. He stood 
awed by the creature’s recounting; 
its method of travel was baffling, its 
poetics appealing. There was an ex- 
citement in the experience, an un- 
ease that anguished yet rang true to 
the core of his being. “Where,” he 
mumbled, “did your craft go down? 
Can it be salvaged? Repaired?” 

“My envelope,” Igman-Luy an- 
swered, “was absorbed into the vast 
planetary liquid. It is, I fear, no 
more.” 

The time had come for him to 



ask the key question, to apply the 
test his people had devised long 
ago. “Can you,” Snorflapp asked 
with serious resolution, “identify 
this sound?” 

“What? Another test?” panted 
the alien. “Another analysis for in- 
telligence? Can’t you see I am dying? 
Go away. Escape!” 

Snorflapp suffered a flush of em- 
barrassment, as well as a slight 
touch of fear that his opportunity 
was slipping away. “Please, my 
scaly friend — May I call you 
friend? Please try to understand; I’m 
greatly interested and hopeful of as- 
sisting you.” 

Igman-Luy responded wearily, 
“Oh, I understand. Were I in 
your place, and had I my envelope 
and liaison devices, I would prob- 
ably be doing the same thing. I’ve 
often dreamed of discovering true 
intelligence in outer space, but — 
Keep them back! KEEP THEM 
AWAY FROM ME!” 

The bipeders were regathering 
their armaments. Snorflapp noted 
the movement and Igman-Luy ’s 
violent response. “It . might be 
possible,” he said, “for me to af- 
ford you the protection of a static 
shield similar to the one I’m wear- 
ing, if you’re at all interested. It 
would defend you from further 
physical attack.” 

“Could you help me escape this 
mud ball planet, too?” 

Snorflapp calculated. “The two 
shields would effectively separate us 
and prevent contamination. ...”

The saurian became suddenly 
excited. Its wide tail thumped the 
ground. “Salvation?” it cried. 
“Hope?” 

Snorflapp cleared his throat. 
“Mutual trust would, I think, bene- 
fit us both,” he said, judiciously. 

“Yes, yes.‘ I’m sure you’re 
right,” Igman-Luy responded 
nervously, eyeing the approaching 
mob. “Ask me your question. Give 
me your test. And, should I 
fail . afford me a quick and 
painless death, please.” 

Snorflapp was equally nervous, 
but he signaled his ship, ordering it 
to fill the air with a crackling, boil- 
ing set of auditory cues. “Can 
you,” he repeated, “identify this 
sound?” 

The alien cocked its head 
momentarily and said, “It has 
something to do with cooking; am I 
right?” 

“You’re getting warm.” 

The orange -and-green reptile cast 
another worried glance at the mass- 
ing natives. “Perhaps,” it said, “it 
would be better if you clothed me 
in that protective shield of yours, 
before the attack is renewed.” 

“It’ll only take a second. Finish 
your answer first. I’m timing the 
response.” 

“Oh. Ah, -it’s weird,” said the 
other, “but, I seem to be receiving 
some sort of low-level impression 
concerning your offspring; or is it 
mine?” 

“Go on.” 

“It — it’s an image of direct de- 



scendants. Children. Children cook- 
ing? No. Children being cooked! 
My Crat, that’s barbaric! You cook 
and eat your offspring? It’s disgust- 
ing, revolting. You’re a race of 
heathens, unclean, worse than the 
pale little monsters that surround us. 
How can that be?” 

Upon hearing these words, 

Snorflapp’s fear melted like a comet 
at perihelion. The old test had prov- 
en true. He tried unsuccessfully to 
mask his enthusiasm. 

“That’s it,” he laughed. 

“You’ve passed. You’ve passed on 
all three levels.” 

Igman-Luy was bewildered. 

Snorflapp nearly glowed with de- 
light. “Please, believe and excuse 
me,” he gushed. “The test was de- 
signed to diagnose altruism, as well 
as intellect and intuition. Your dis- 
gust and revulsion were necessary 
qualities; they identify you as a 
member of a responsive and com- 
passionate race. I can’t tell you 
what this means to me; until this 
moment, the sound has never been 
correctly identified. These natives, 
for example, probably would never 
have guessed it, and my trip would 
have been far less important than it 
is now that I have met you. Here, 
let me signal for the protective sta- 
tic shield.” 

Igman-Luy was dazed, but he felt 
less anxious after the auxiliary 
shield had coalesced around his 
body. He sensed a touch of the bi- 
zarre in this oozing creature’s 
thoughts, but he knew a firm faith 



58 



GALAXY 




and undaunted trust would do much 
to further the relationship and ab- 
solve suspicion. 

While the two aliens lumbered 
together up the hill toward the inter- 
stellar craft, the crowd grew furious 
and renewed its attack on the now- 
invulnerable pair. 

“We’ll share the fame and pro- 
fit,” Snorflapp gestured expan- 
sively, and an unnoticed inhabitant 
sailed majestically through the air. 
“When I think of what might have 
happened had I not arrived in 
time. ...” 

Igman-Luy turned and looked 
out over the throng before entering 
the ship. “You’re right, my 
friend,” he sighed. “It is indeed 
strange; the timing is uncannily per- 
fect. In a way, this planet has been 
a buffer absorbing the trauma of our 
first meeting.” The proud dragon 
turned and moved into a cushioned 
seat, preparing himself for escape. 
“But, the important thing is that 
you and 1 have met without suffer- 
ing the usual suspicion and fear. 1 
see a great future for our two races, 
Snorflapp. I see a glorious union 
that may, someday, take us beyond 
the confines of our own galaxy.” 

Snorflapp was elevating his ship 
through the planet’s swirling fog 
and clouds. “You know, Luy,” he 
said, “1 think this is the beginning 
of a beautiful friendship.”

A Message from the Publisher 



THE BEST TO JIM 



r AITHFUL READERS of GALAXY 
will notice something missing from 
the masthead next month — the name 
of James Patrick Baen. Jim will be 
sorely missed here, and we know 
you’ll miss him too. Any editor 
whose magazine increases its circu- 
lation more than SO per cent in less 
than a year must be doing some- 
thing right! 

But we can understand the siren 
call that has drawn Jim away from 
GALAXY to become science fiction 
editor of Jim’s caliber, we think 
ing publisher of sf, Ace has gone 
through some lean times in recent 
years — but with the support of its 
new owner, Grosset & Dunlap Inc., 
Ace is making its big move to be- 
come Number One again. With an 
iditor of Jim’s caliber, we think 
they’ll do it. 

First as managing editor under 
Ejiler Jakobsson, then as editor in 
his own right, Jim spent four years 
with GALAXY. It was a brief ten- 
60 



ure compared to those of the 
celebrated H.L. Gold and Frederik 
Pohl, but it will be remembered just 
the same. Jim’s devotion to the 
magazine was equaled only by the 
devotion of thousands of readers. 

“I found it a very rewarding job, 
though at times a frustrating one,” 
he says. ‘‘The single greatest award 
was the interaction with the general 
readership, for which I have an 
even greater respect now than I did 
four years ago.” 

That respect was the real secret 
of his success. He respected the in- 
telligence of his readers; he looked 
up to them and they looked up to 
him. This relationship is one that is 
difficult for any editor to 
achieve — but achieve it he must to 
be a success for very long in any 
field, especially science fiction. 

At Ace, Jim will have every 
chance for even greater success. For 
starters, Grosset & Dunlap is mak- 
ing a big financial investment on a 

GALAXY 




major sf program. Tom Doherty, 
senior vice president for Ace, re- 
ceived a standing ovation from 
members of the Science Fiction 
Writers of America at a recent 
meeting. And if you know anything 
about the SFWA, you know how 
rarely that kind of thing happens. 

Plans call for at least 110 titles a 
year — two thirds of them new ac- 
quisitions, the rest from the 
backlist. But that’s only the begin- 
ning of Jim’s plans for this latest 
chapter of his science-fiction career. 

For instance, he plans to start his 
own magazine (yes, a competition 
perhaps but we’re generous-minded 
enough to welcome that). It will be 
a paperback book-size bimonthly 
but that will be its only resemblance 
to original anthologies such as Orbit 
and New Dimensions. It will have 
its own editorials, science column, 
book reviews, interior illos, maybe 
even letters. Nothing quite like it 
has been done before, save as a 
one-shot experiment. 

For another instance: Running 
backlist material will not necessarily 
mean just reprinting from old plates 
and, at most, slapping on a new 
cover. For a Foul Anderson Month 
promotion in February, one of the 
six Anderson titles is a book previ- 
ously issued as War of the Wing 
Men — a condensed version of a 
novel serialized as The Man Who 
Counts. Jim is restoring Anderson’s 
original title and allowing him to 
restore the text to his own satisfac- 
tion. 



A two-volume omnibus of Ander- 
son’s work. The Flandry Compan- 
ion, will put together several stories 
in the Flandry series that have seen 
print before (more or less at ran- 
dom), plus a new 40,000-word 
short novel devoted to the adven- 
tures of Anderson’s galactic secret 
agent. Plus a chronology of the fu- 
ture history through which Flandry 
moves. Plus an introduction by An- 
derson himself. Plus an afterword 
by noted sf critic Sandra Miesel. 

Fritz Leiber’s Conjure Wife, a 
classic horror story of witchcraft in 
a modern college campus setting, 
has never received much promotion 
in several paperback editions. But 
Ace will treat it this time as a 
Major Publishing Event, with a big 
advertising push and sp>ecial dumps 
(black lettering on copper foil, or 
copper or black, to match the two 
alternate covers) for book stores. 

Putting in that much work on the 
backlist is almost unprecedented in 
science fiction — but Jim plans to do 
it as a matter of course, and not 
only for Anderson and Leiber. 

As for those new titles, Jim is 
playing his cards pretty close to his 
chest but he hints, “One or two of 
them may be startling.’’ One thing 
for sure, he adds: “Ace is going 
into very aggressive development of 
its sf list.’’ 

That list may include a revival of 
the famed Ace Specials, which 
earned much prestige for the firm 
under Donald A. Wollheim and 
Terry Carr in the old days. It may 



THE BEST TO JIM 



61 




also include a new sf series, more 
sophisticated than the familiar ad- 
venture series of the past, with its 
own distinctive format and artwork. 

Ace Doubles, the vehicle for 
many short novels in the past, will 
be continued — but with a new for- 
mat: single covers, with both short 
novels printed right side up. In gen- 
eral, it will be the policy to feature 
the same author in both halves of 
each double. 

GALAXY readers will be glad to 
know that Jim’s connection with the 
magazine will not be completely 
broken. Tentative plans have been 
laid for a series of GALAXY Spe- 
cials (centered around such themes 
as future warfare and alien contact) 
that will be published simulta- 
neously in magazine format by us 
and in paperback format by Ace. 

Jim also has tentative plans for 
Ace to publish another The Best of 
GALAXY anthology, using material 
from his last year with the 
magazine. He may even issue a 
Best of the Best of GALAXY, culled 
from the last four years. 

Here at GALAXY itself, Jim’s 
last direct contribution is this 
month’s editorial outlining an out- 
landish (but practical — check out 
Jerry Poumelle’s response) proposal 
for broadcast-powered electric 
spaceships. 

But his influence will be felt even 
after his official departure. Starting 
next month, for example, is the 
three-part serialization of Roger 
Zelazny’s The Courts of Chaos, 

62 



final novel in the famed Amber 
series (with a cover by the noted 
Wendy Pini, yet). It was one of 
Jim’s last and proudest acquisitions, 
and it will be a treat for all who 
have followed the chronicles of 
Amber here the last few years. 

Also coming up in GALAXY 
next month is Charles Sheffield’s 
“The Long Chance,” a love story 
with a difference. And watch for 
such delightful items as Thomas 
Wylde’s “Jogging up Main Street” 
and Herbert Gerjuoy’s “The Holy 
Temple” — new stories by new writ- 
ers Jim discovered during his last 
few months here. Some of his ac- 
quisitions will still be appearing in 
December and beyond. 

In science fiction the writers, 
editors and even many of the read- 
ers form a close-knit community. 
Professional relationships are rarely 
distant or anonymous; people know 
the people they’re dealing with. 
Being a success means being one of 
the Good Guys, and Jim Baen has 
always been one of those — ask any- 
one who has dealt with him. 

We at GALAXY are sorry to see 
him leave, much as we wish him all 
success in his new position. During 
his years here, he has earned our 
respect, just as he has earned that of 
sf professionals and readers. In sci- 
ence fiction circles, he is considered 
one of the top young editors. We 
know he has the ability to go far 
and we’re going to enjoy seeing 
him do it.

Special Feature 



STAR WARS — Pro and Con 

PRO — Jay Kay Klein 






1 . HE GREATEST scicnce-fiction 
picture ever made,” was the first 
comment I heard about Star 
Wars — over the phone by a well- 
known science-fiction editor and 
publisher who had just been to the 
world premiere. A few weeks later 
the picture reached the upstate New 
York city where Hive, and the next 
day it was reviewed favorably on 
the front page of a local paper — 
setting an unheard-of precedent. 
Star Wars is obviously something 
special. 

So far I’ve come across only two 
dissents, strangely enough by the 
editors of two leading science- 
fiction magazines. One appeared in 
the letter column of Time magazine 
and the other was expressed to me 
as I sat next to Jim Baen during the 
banquet of a science-fiction conven- 
tion in Syracuse, New York, where 
Jim was the guest of honor. 

That afternoon the conventioneers 
had gone en masse to see Star Wars 



and I had been surprised to find 
myself in a minority of persons who 
had not already sat through at least 
one showing. Most of the fans had 
attended two or more times, with 
one young man claiming a total of 
six. 

Afterward everyone discussed 
exactly which Academy Awards the 
picture would take. Certainly Spe- 
cial Effects, probably Best Picture, 
and absolutely not Best Actor. 

The picture obviously was put to- 
gether by someone who understands 
and appreciates science fiction. Star 
Wars is pure science fiction, with 
the background of understanding 
we have come to take for granted 
in stories appearing in Galaxy: 
interstellar empire, alien intelli- 
gences, self-directed robots, FTL 
drive, super-powerful weapons and 
strange-and-wonderful sights of all 
kinds. If there is an erring, it is on 
the side of assuming that viewers 
are fully acquainted with such stand-

ard science-fiction elements. To 
Hollywood’s surprise (1 would sup- 
pose), theater-goers have been tak- 
ing it all in stride and asking for 
more. 

They’re certainly going to get 
more too. Everything I’ve heard in- 
dicates that there will be 57 or 157 
or maybe 257 varieties of science- 
fiction pictures churned out in the 
next several years. Presumably the 
first ones will be the worst ones. 

Star Wars’ influence lies, first, in 
opening the floodgates for mass 
production of future science-fiction 
pictures and, second, in setting 
standards by which movie-makers 
can judge what the mass public 
wants to see. We must make no 
mistake in thinking that fans alone 
are piling up the millions in theater 
ticket-offices. We should be thank- 
ful, though, that this feat was ac- 
complished by a real, hard-core 
science-fiction film. At the heart of 
the performance is an honest, 
thoughtful attempt by Lucas to pre- 
sent a genuine view of the future, 
an attempt that comes across with 
sincerity and with the best presenta- 
tion that technology can create and 
money can buy. 

What 2001 did for ten million 
dollars ten years ago. Star Wars has 
surpassed for ten million dollars in 
inflated 1977 currency. This was 
made possible by the same elec- 
tronic developments that are rev- 
olutionizing the rest of man’s 
world. The computer made Star 
Wars possible, and at relatively low 



cost. Machine-generated visual pro- 
jections — camera views of what 
must be models (even if your eyes 
tell you everything you see is full- 
size and real), a planet exploding, 
star ships annihilated, warriors zap- 
ping enemies and everything else 
that comes under the Hollywood 
term of “special effects’’ — all these 
must be traced to the availability of 
powerful computers and associated 
graphic interface systems. 

Gone forever in any future 
science-fiction picture are papier- 
mache tunnels, balsa- wood space- 
ships strung from wires, extras 
dressed in rented Halloween cos- 
tumes. 2001 may have been a criti- 
cal success (after all, it was very 
obscure) and it even made money 
but it started no ensuing school of 
science-fiction pictures. 

1 have been told that Kubrick’s 
2001 scene-cutting techniques have 
influenced subsequent films of all 
types. Lucas’s Star Wars’ special 
effects will influence all subse- 
quent science-fiction films. Since in 
a very real sense, science-fiction 
films are “people” stories laid in 
unearthly surroundings, Lucas’ 
trend-setting contribution is bringing 
the science-fiction film to maturity. 
Just as we can divide science-fiction 
stories into those pre-dating Stanley 
Weinbaum’s unprecedented “Mar- 
tian Odyssey” and those that came 
after, I believe we will be able to 
divide science-fiction films into 
those pre-dating George Lucas’ 
Star Wars and those after.

Discussion among fans differs 
wildly from the criticism prepared 
by reviewers for the general press. 
The attitude of the latter is that Star 
Wars is a cowboy picture set in the 
future. I would guess that such 
statements are the results of cultural 
shock. When an unsophisticated 
person sees something beyond his 
limited personal experience, he can 
describe it only in terms familiar to 
him, no matter how irrelevant or 
off-the-mark these may be. 

Dismissing Star Wars as a cow- 
boy picture in fancy costume is as 
bad a reading as referring to Romeo 
and Juliet as a boy-meets-girl 
story. Star Wars is not simply good 
guys versus bad buys but a depic- 
tion of free men banding together to 
resist a gigantic tyranny, along with 
coming-of-age story mingled witha 
a mystical from-the-Far-East phi- 
losophy. All of these themes are 
appealing to today’s young people, 
who not coincidentally, I am sure, 
form the largest group of movie- 
goers and science-fiction readers. 
Lucas must surely have aimed at 
those most likely to turn his produc- 
tion into a box-office smash. Young 
people’s enthusiasm for a story pro- 
vides no reason to suppose it is in 
any way a poor piece of literature; 
otherwise Treasure Island would 
have been forgotten years ago. 

Where Star Wars does show 
weakness is in the stock, cardboard 
characterizations of the humans, a 
fault shared by most science fiction 
of the past and by much of the pres- 



ent. That is why the two robots — 
by universal consensus — “steal the 
show;’’ they are the only fully re- 
alized beings in the picture, along 
perhaps with the Wookie. Again, 
this situation is common in science 
fiction. Doc Smith’s Lensman 
series, still popular with young 
people after more than thirty years, 
features cardboard humans and in- 
teresting aliens. In theme, content 
and treatment. Star Wars and the 
Lensman stories are close cousins, if 
not identical twins. Oh — and it oc- 
curs to me that now Doc Smith’s 
Galactic Patrol can be put on the 
screen, using Lucas’s cinematic 
processes. 

The strength of science-fiction 
stories lies more in what happens, 
how it happens and where it happens 
than in to whom it happtens and 
what was said while it was happen- 
ing. The problems for fans loom 
ahead, first with movie-makers fired 
with zest for Art, what college liter- 
ature courses refer to as the “hu- 
man condition.” Tie this approach 
to an Oedipus myth or something 
else left over from ancient Greece, 
along with portentous dialogue, and 
we may look forward to real disas- 
ter pictures. 

The second danger I foresee is a 
repeat of many, many past situa- 
tions wherein producers who don’t 
understand science fiction at all as- 
sign work to directors who despise 
it. The difference in the future is 
that even bad science-fiction films 
will have beautiful settings and spe-

cial effects. Fans will come out of 
theaters wondering how anyone 
could do so little with so much. 

Leaving a Star Wars’ showing, 
fans launch directly into discussion 
of the supierb details Lucas has 
thrown in with such a lavish hand. 
The visual throwaways alone, 
glimpsed for just a few seconds, 
provide a richness and complexity 
never before seen in a science- 
fiction film. In 200! an occasional 
bit of business such as a familiar 
IBM logo placed in an unfamiliar, 
futuristic setting was treated with 
lengthy heavy-handedness. In Star 
Wars there are literally hundreds of 
brief flashes of the future and it is 
these that lead fans to see the pic- 
ture several times. Star Wars is not 
a quickie film in any sense of the 
word. 

The reviewers that likened Star 
Wars to a cowboy picture appar- 
ently failed to see C-3PO’s and 
R2-D2’s function as comedy relief 
against the serious backdrop of the 
threat to billions of people of an- 
nihilation. Nor did the reviewers — 
lacking any knowledge of science 
fiction — ^note the similarity of set- 
ting on Luke Skywalker’s planet to 
that of Dune, even to the Fremen- 
type stillsuit worn by the Tusken 
raiders. The inclusion of Obi-Wan 
Kenobi’s universal Force and 
philosophy of living raises the pic- 
ture above a level of simple 
materialism and provides Luke with 
a father image for growing up, 
while giving the production a deus 



ex machina to help move the plot, 
along. (And I predict that Alec Gu- 
ness’s part will help the picture do 
fabulously well in Japan!) 

There are, however, some 
genuine objections that can be 
raised to Star Wars — having to do 
with credibility. Jim Baen, for in- 
stance, was concerned with several 
possible errors. One was why an 
Imperial starcruiser would take 
aboard a captured starship when 
there was every possibility that the 
captive might self-destruct violently. 
Another was how tiny fighter ships 
could zoom along Death Star’s sur- 
face when the much larger and 
more powerful blockade runner be- 
longing to Han Solo was trapped in 
the battle station’s magnetic beams. 

The answer to these points lies 
with internal consistency. Since we 
are dealing with the future and a 
wide range of experience outside 
present-day knowledge, almost any- 
thing may be possible as far as we 
know. But the impossible in one 
part of the film cannot miraculously 
become possible in another. In a 
contemporary film when, say, a 
person driving a Ford is pursued by 
a police car, we do not wonder why 
the driver didn’t speed up to 300 
m.p.h. or go straight up the side of 
a cliff to shake off the follower. We 
know what’s possible and what’s 
impossible, and the film-maker op- 
erates on the assumption that we do 
indeed know these things about the 
world. .and that this knowledge 
justifies our expectations .

GALAXY 




Being set in the far future, Star 
Wars may have its own implied 
consistencies. If the Imperial star- 
cruiser took aboard a captive ship, 
there is every reason to suppose it 
was placed in a heavily shielded 
area. Certainly Luke Skywalker, 
Han Solo and the Princess were 
able to blast their way through ordi- 
nary interior walls but they were 
helplessly trapped in a waste- 
treatment chamber where dangerous 
objects such as laser weapons might 
find their way for reduction to 
scrap. Nor is there any reason to 
suppose one-man fighters would be 
made of magnetic materials. To the 
contrary, being light and highly 
mobile, the rebel ships might very 
well be constructed entirely of 
aluminum or plastics — or austenitic 
stainless steel, for that matter. 

The few parts that disturbed me 
were lapses such as Han Solo’s 
comment that his ship was so fast it 
could reach Alderan in 15 parsecs. 
Well . very few period pictures 
avoid all outright errors, anach- 
ronisms or a fumble over some- 
thing that only an expert would dis- 
cern. The remarkable thing is that 
Star Wars has so few mistakes of 
this kind. More serious were what 1 
consider weaknesses of motivation 
or commonsense. Luke may have 
been young but his readiness to en- 
danger his mission and his life to 
rescue a princess he had never be- 
fore heard of was simply childish. I 
will say that she was well worth res- 
cuing since she turned out not to 



be a fairy-tale cliche. Armed with 
a laser weapon and in comparison 
with her rescuers, she reminded me 
of David Ben Gurion’s description 
of Golda Meier: “She’s the only 
man in my cabinet.’’ (Makes you 
want to give Princess Leia Organa 
the well-known mattress test.) 

To me the worst of all unbe- 
lievabilities was Luke’s instantane- 
ous conversion into a fighter pilot. 
Surely high-order training of at least 
some months’ duration would be 
required for this. To give Lucas 
credit, this and nearly every other 
plot weakness was given some sort 
of explanation. It had been estab- 
lished that Luke was an accom- 
plished pilot in a planetary game 
similar to mechanized polo. 

I’ve heard it stated that the fact 
of Luke’s piloting, along with other 
plot groundings, had been more 
fully developed in some twenty 
minutes of film cut from the 
finished picture. Hopefully, this cut- 
ting was done to improve the pace 
and not to permit theater owners to 
squeeze in three matinees in place 
of two. Star Wars moves at a fast 
pace, sure enough. Unlike 2001 , in 
which the cameras dwelled lovingly 
on a scene to the point of boredom. 
Star Wars piles visual impression 
on top of visual impression. One of 
these is that of Darth Vader spin- 
ning out of control and away from 
the exploding Death Star; then — in 
just a few seconds shown on the 
screen — he regains enough control 
to present us with the possibility of

his return in Star Wars H, along 
with an Imperial fleet as yet un- 
touched by attrition. 

I’d also vote Star Wars the best 
science-fiction picture made so far. 
It heralds the first in a new era of 



science-fiction films, some of which 
will surely be as good — and a few 
even better. Meanwhile, I’m going 
to see Star Wars at least one more 
time. I’d not be surprised if you did 
too. ★ 



CON— Jeff Rovin 



I RECENTLY RECEIVED a phone Call 
from a young science-fiction buff 
who was busy recruiting members 
for the Jedi Knights, a Star Wars 
fan club. 

“We’re not like Trekkies,’’ he 
assured me. “Our group is de- 
voted to a serious study of Star 
Wars, the Force and alien beings.’’ 

I thanked the caller but begged 
off from membership. When asked 
why, 1 explained that while Star 
Wars had an excellent musical 
score, the rest of the film was pure 
dross. Stunned, the knight errant 
muttered an oath and hung up. 

Not like Star Wars? Impossible. 
Everyone loves the film — including 
the critics. Star Wars is breaking 
box-office records everywhere; it 
played a command performance at 
the White House; and there’s even 
talk of its snaring a record number 
of Oscars. Several sequels are in the 



works; the novelization by director 
George Lucas is a bestseller; the 
Twentieth Century Fox merchandis- 
ing department is up to its near- 
sighted eyeballs in orders for every- 
thing from posters to forty-dollar 
Stormtrooper masks to home-movie 
films. All of which goes to show 
that, unfortunately, public taste is 
what it used to be. 

Back in the 1930s and 40s people 
flocked to Saturday-afternoon mati- 
nees at local movie houses to watch 
the latest episode of a Flash Gordon 
or Buck Rogers serial. In their day 
these chapter plays were superb en- 
tertainment. With contagious hubris, 
olond, young Buster Crabbe played 
both heroes as naive men of for- 
titude, while dogging their foot- 
steps were exciting battles with 
exotic weapons, bizarre alien races 
and the nastiest villains the screen 
had ever seen. Loads of fun, these

serial space operas were as plausible 
as any as far ,is the technology of 
the era was concerned. Then came 
Hitler’s rockets, the space race and 
the lunar and Martian landings, and 
we became progressively more 
sophisticated in our view of outer 
space. The better science- fiction 
films of these succeeding decades 
reflected this growing maturity by 
melding more or less credible plots 
with realistic hardware, i.e., such 
pictures as Destination Moon 
(1950), Forbidden Planet (1956), 
2001 : A Space Odyssey (1%8) and 
television’s Star Trek. Flash 
Gordon and Buck Rogers? Progress 
had reduced them to quaint relics 
of a more whimsical time. 

Enter Star Wars, which dips into 
this by-gone froth for substance. As 
a result, it spins the simple-minded 
story of blond, young and naive 
Luke Skywalker from the desert 
world, Tatooine. Buying robot R2-D2 
and its sidekick, C-P30, from mer- 
chants, Luke soon learns that these 
are no ordinary mechanizations. 
They belong to Ehincess Leia Or- 
gana, who has been kidnapped by 
Grand Moff Tarkin of the dictatorial 
Galactic Empire. However, before 
her abduction Leia hid blueprints to 
the Empire’s lethal space station. 
Death Star, inside R2-D2. These 
plans must reach rebel authorities if 
the Empire’s planet-destroying 
globe is to be stopped. Thus Luke 
adopts the lovely Leia’s cause 
and — with the robots, the telekinetic 
Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, a 



mercenary named Han Solo and 
Solo’s hirsuite associate Chewbacca 
(a seven-foot-tall Wookie pirate) — 
encounters nasty antagonists, does 
battle with exotic weapons, meets 
bizarre alien races and wades 
through other situations plucked 
straight from the Buster Crabbe 
films. Eventually he rescues the 
princess, delivers the blueprints to 
rebel forces and helps them locate a 
weak spot in the structure of the 
Death Star. Leading a fleet of small 
ships against the giant sphere, Luke 
is able to blast it to smithereens. 

If you’re the general public, you 
have been calling this motion pic- 
ture “escapist fun.’’ However, if 
you’re a thinking individual, you 
find yourself wondering how any- 
one could produce such twaddle. 
Not only is it a collection of 
science-fiction gimmicks that went 
stale over a quarter-century ago but 
it wallows in a sea of platitudes 
from western, pirate and war films. 
To wit, we have a gunfight in an 
alien saloon; a dogfight with one- 
man spaceships; a swordfight in a 
bay of the C^th Star (what Errol 
Flynn and Basil Rathbone would 
have done with this sequence; now 
that’s escapist fun!); and so forth. 
Perhaps this is Lucas’s way of salut- 
ing the great adventure films of the 
past. But a cliche is a cliche, and 
the director has succeeded not in 
enriching his film through imitation 
but inducing us to yearn for the 
exuberant originals all the more! 

Yet Star Wars’ negligence lies 



STAR WARS REVIEWED

not only in its lack of structural in- 
vention. There is also an annoying 
Wizard of Oz garnish that makes it 
oh-so-coy, what with a tin man 
(C-P30), an often-times cowardly 
lion (Chewbacca), Dorothy’s Auntie 
Em (Luke’s Aunt Beru) and munch- 
kins in the form of the robot- 
scavenging Jawas. Even the golden 
sands of Tatooine are a Yellow 
Brick Road of sorts, which Luke 
crosses to find the wizard Kenobi. 
If a science-fiction author handed a 
story like that to a responsible 
science-fiction publisher, it would 
quite properly be shredded and 
diced before his or her very eyes. 

Too, though in itself a minor an- 
noyance, the picture opens with 
several paragraphs that explain the 
political situation as it exists before 
the narrative proper begins. This 
crawling * prologue creates the im- 
pression that one has stumbled ufKtn 
the second installment of a two-part 
story! Actually the passages are 
more telling than they seem. Such 
copy has traditionally prefaced his- 
torical epics like El Cid and The 
Guns of Navarone, where there was 
a wealth of factual data to present 
to the audience. However, in Star 
Wars, a work of fiction, there was 
no reason to burden the viewer with 
such tritely organized exposition. It 
was simply a means for the 
scenarists to set the stage through 
other than cleverly constructed 
dialogue. 

As it turns out. Star Wars’ 
greatest problem can be traced to 

70 



screenwriters who didn’t do their 
job. The film’s lack of engaging 
plot aside, it is devoid of any dra- 
matic style or wit. Spoken ex- 
changes are puerile and do nothing 
to flesh-out the characters. When 
Luke’s aunt and uncle are 
slaughtered by Empire Stormtroop- 
ers on suspicion of harboring 
R2-D2, we don’t care; in the inter- 
est of getting on with the shoot- 
em-up action, Lucas avoided the 
kinds of scenes that would have 
given these characters depth and 
made Luke’s decision to avenge 
their death a rousing crowd-pleaser. 
Later in the film Han Solo deposits 
Luke and his party at the rebel 
camp, collects his fee and leaves — 
only to come rocketing back into 
the film just as Grand Moff Tar- 
kin’s right-hand tartar, Darth Vader, 
is about to ice Mr. Skywalker. Why 
the abrupt change in the merce- 
nary’s temperament? Until this 
moment there is never a hint that 
Solo might be loyal to more than 
just himself and money. 

Further blanching this mildewed 
corn are performances that fully 
complement the script: dull and 
deadpan. This cheats the movie of 
what may have been its lone saving 
grace, a tongue-in-cheek approach 
to give it some sparkle (the way it 
did Richard Lester’s magnificent 
1973 movie. The Three Musketeers). 
It all adds up to characterizations 
that are wholly two-dimensional, an 
amateurishness that is intolerable in 
any form of drama. 



GALAXY 




On a different level entirely, the 
picture's technical work has natu- 
rally been likened to that of the last 
great space film, 2001: A Space 
Odyssey. It is a comparison that 
puts Star Wars way out of its 
league. Visually there is none of the 
breathtaking movement, design or 
poetry that made Stanley Kubrick’s 
picture so memorable and, special 
effectswise, the alien makeup is 
plastic and unconvincing (contribut- 
ing artist Rick Baker, the man who 
built and played Dino De Laurentiis’ 
King Kong, has done better), while 
the mattes (the union of miniature 
models with life-sized sets) are im- 
precise. 

Scientifically Star Wars is also 
inexcusably careless, boasting an 
offensive disregard for both physics 
and biology. For example, living in 
the Tatooine desert are shaggy 
giants known as banthas (another 
tribute to the moldy past, this time 
to Edgar Rice Burroughs’ Martian 
banths). Earth’s Ice Age mam- 
moths didn’t have so much hair! 
Then there are alien beings that 
look like humanoid walruses, in- 
sects and other terrestrial creatures. 
Why wasn’t any thought applied to 
creating invertebrates, quadrupeds 
or beasts whose design immediately 
describes foreign worlds and cli- 
mates? And what about the 
auditorium-sized garbage compactor 
on the Death Star? Surely peoples 
who have mastered matter- 
reorganization on a nuclear level 
would have a cleaner means of de- 



stroying or recycling waste and the 
efficiency for more productive use 
of that area of the space vessel. 
Compounding these inequities are 
tractor beams that work on some 
spaceships and not on others, as the 
plot decrees; areas in Empire ships 
for the exploding of captured 
crafts — blasts for which the alleged 
shielding would have been insuffi- 
cient protection; and so on. Clearly, 
anything that pleased the film’s 
creators was tossed into the action, 
regardless of how little scientific 
sense it made. 

However, independent of these 
various failings. Star Wars does 
succeed in one respect: It totally re- 
volts those viewers, my.self in- 
cluded, who feel that surrogate 
Nazis have no place in light en- 
tertainment. Images ranging from 
the name Stormtroopers to the 
turned-down brim of Darth Vader’s 
headpiece (reminiscent of German 
helmets during World War II), to 
the brusque and joyless manner of 
the Death Star personnel, to Grand 
Moff Tarkin’s Goebbels-esque 
demeanor — all these are far too 
serious to be used in a frivolous 
fantasy. It’s simply another exam- 
ple of lazy film-making, a means of 
distinguishing the good guys from 
the bad guys when one wishes to 
skip character development in favor 
of filling the screen with proton tor- 
pedoes and lightsabers. At best, 
these icons exhibit a spurious sense 
of responsibility on Lucas’s part. 

So much for Star Wars and its 



STAR WARS REVIEWED 



71 




faults, large and small. Judging 
from the picture’s staggering suc- 
cess, audiences are willing to put up 
with these flaws, a fact that bodes 
ill for the field of science-fiction 
films. The coming years will now 
see a giddy flood of Star Wars im- 
itations, including a remake of Buck 
Rogers and a TV series entitled Star 
Cop, that will taint the saleability of 
provocative works for some time to 
come. Would that more intelligent 
and stimulating space fiction like 
Arthur C. Clarke’s Earthlight or 
Ben Bova’s Millennium had been 
brought to the screen instead of Star 
Wars ! 

Of course only a pompous bone- 
head would insist that all science 
fiction illuminate some foible of 
life, pontificate about morality or 
confront the worth of society’s val- 
ues. We all know that authors like 
Frederic Brown and Harry Harrison 
have spun wondrous, classy non- 
sense for its own sake. However, 
these works have a fundamental pith 
and originality that is totally lacking 
in Star Wars. Not that 99.9% of the 
people who see the picture realize 
this, since they have never read sci- 
ence fiction and are not old enough 
to remember Buster Crabbe. In this 
respect it is conceivable that the 
movie may open young eyes, fire a 
few minds and turn people toward 
quality material. The field can al- 
ways use enthusiastic converts! But 
this does not let Lucas off the hook: 
Science fiction is too damn broad 
and exciting a genre to justify the 



creation of a mindless pastiche like 
Star Wars, no matter what its 
tangential benefits. 

But don’t take just my word for 
it. Former Gala.xy editor H.L. Gold 
said it best when he ran the follow- 
ing rather prophetic comments on 
the back cover of this magazine’s 
first edition in October of 1950; 

Jets blasting. Bat Durston 
came screeching down 
through the atmosphere of 
Bbllzznaj. He cut out his 
super-hyper-drive for the 
landing . .and at that point, 
a tall, lean spaceman stepped 
out of the tail assembly, pro- 
ton gun-blaster in a space- 
tanned hand. 

Hoofs drumming. Bat 
Durston came galloping down 
through the narrow pass at 
Eagle Gulch. He spurred hard 
for a low overhang of rim- 
rock. .and at that point, a 
tall, lean wrangler stepped 
out from behind a high boul- 
der, six-shooter in a sun-tan- 
ned hand. 

“Sound alike? They should — one 
is merely a western transplanted to 
some alien and impossible planet. If 
this is your idea of science fiction, 
you’re welcome to it! you’ll 
NEVER FIND IT IN GALAXY!” 

Alas, we have found it on the 
silver screen, and the genre shall 
long be poorer for it. ★

EXILES TO GLORY 




J. E. Pournelle 



WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

The ecology and zero-growth 
movements have partially suc- 
ceeded. A few international corpo- 
rations have gone to space, but the 
enormous capital investments have 
left them in a financially shaky posi- 
tion, while scandals in government 
have rocked public confidence. 

KEVIN SENEGAL has grown up 
in this world. He comes from a wel- 
fare family, and has entered UCLA 
on a govenment scholarship; the 
universities are largely structured to 
keep younger people off the labor 
market. Tempermentally a loner, 
Kevin has made few friends, and his 
main ambition is to obtain his en- 
gineering degree so that he can join 
a powerful union, get a job, and 
enter the middle class. A few weeks 
before graduation his comfortable 
world comes apart. 

First he is attacked by muggers 
and in defending himself kills one of 
the juveniles. The public authorities 
will prosecute him for “child kil- 
ling” if they learn Kevin’s 
identity — and the Green Fence 
gang, to which the muggers be- 
longed, already knows who Kevin 
is. They seek revenge, and his life 
is in danger. 

Meanwhile the administrators at 
UCLA find irregularities in his 
academic work, and although he 
can demonstrate his competence, 
will require two more years in 
school before he can graduate. Bat- 
tered by these pressures and dis- 
gusted by the society he lives in, 
Kevin, on the advice of one of his 
professors, applies to the Deadalus 
Corporation. He is offered profes- 



sional status — labor is not so easy 
to come by in the asteroid belt be- 
cause few have ever returned — but 
he must leave Earth immediately. 
Kevin rejects the offer, but a new 
attempt on his life by the Green 
Fence gang convinces him he has 
no choice. 

Kevin flies to Baja California 
where the Hansen Corporation 
maintains a laser system for launch- 
ing personnel and cargo into orbit. 
At the Hansen facilities he meets 
Bill Dykes, a former Lunar rockrat; 
Wiley Ralston, a classmate at 
UCLA who has recently graduated; 
and Ellen MacMillan, an engineer 
who has bought her own ticket to 
Ceres. 

The launching system malfunc- 
tions and Kevin and Ellen are 
nearly killed. Kevin does not believe 
it was an accident, but he knows no 
reason why anyone would be in- 
terested in killing either him or 
MacMillan. Ellen, however, does 
not seem surprised. She insists that 
they go on board Wayfarer on 
schedule rather than wait for an in- 
vestigation of the accident; the ship 
will not delay departure, and Way- 
farer may be the last passenger/ 
cargo ship to Ceres. 

Kevin's cabinmate aboard Way- 
farer is Jacob Norsedal, an over- 
weight, diabetic computer freak. 
The voyage to Ceres lasts nine 
months, and during that time Kevin 
and Ellen have a brief romance, 
complicated by an almost total lack 
of privacy (there are 120 people in 
a ship designed to carry only 60) 
and Ellen’s insistence that she will 
not form any lasting relationship. 
Their affair is to end when the ship

(2.767 AU) from Sun. 

Mass: 8 x grams. Radius: 370 kilometers. 
Surface area: somewhat larger than the state of 
Texas. 

Period: 4.6 years. Rotation: 9 hours, 5 minutes. 
Surface gravity: 38.9 centimeters/second = .04 
Earth gravity. 

Escape Velocity: 5.37 x 10^ centimeters. 

Path velocity in orbit: 17.9 kilometers/second. 

Largely composed of stone, Ceres has an easily ac- 
cessible metalic core containing rich, commercially 
valuable deposits of gold, silver, tin, copper, nickel, 
and iron, as well as sup^heavy elements such as 
Arthurium in recoverable quantities. Water-ice exists 
both in permafrost and underground deposits. 

The first expedition to Ceres in 1997 was financed by 
Hansen Enterprises (Ltd. et Cie, General Headquar- 
ters Luna). Interplanet of Zurich subsequently made 
extensive investments in mining and refinery opera- 
tions on Ceres. The commercial future of this venture 
is uncertain.

The office was Aeneas MacKen- 
zie’s only real luxury. It had a real 
window of thick quartz that over- 
looked the barren landscape of the 
Moon, and beyond that the glory of 
Earth hung suspended in black vel- 
vet. He often sat at his desk and 
stared out at the fragile Earth, a 
small blue world wrapped in white 
wispy clouds. He had lived on the 
Moon for twenty years and would 
never return to the world of his 
birth; but he loved Earth, and he 
missed her. 

So little time, he thought. So lit- 
tle time until — he broke off the 
thought, because he had a vivid im- 
agination, and it would be all too 
easy to see the fragile Earth covered 
with pinpoints of brilliant light, 
lights that would shine more 
brightly than the Sun until they 
faded and the ugly mushroom 
clouds rose through Earth’s clean 
garments. 

It would be easy, too, to imagine 
that he could see beneath the 
clouds, watch men and women 
working their lives out to no pur- 
pose but continued misery and star- 
vation. That was life now for all too 
many; in a few years the globe 
might be covered with people who 
had nothing left to hope for. Des- 
peration might tempt them to any- 
thing. 

There were faint sounds in the 
office; the whine of the air system, 
the faint rumblings of his miners 



digging into the lunar regolith, other 
sounds of construction and expan- 
sion; the sounds of success, and 
they mocked him. The future of 
Diana Base, and of Earth, did not 
depend on lunar miners. It de- 
pended on hard-eyed men in dark 
suits who sat in Zurich board 
rooms; it depended on the man in 
the Oval Office in Washington, and 
another man in the Kremlin; but 
mostly it depended on events more 
than a hundred million miles away, 
and over those Aeneas had no con- 
trol. 

His reverie was interrupted by a 
voice in his head. It made no 
sound, and if there had been anyone 
in the room with him, they would 
not have heard it; the implanted 
transceiver fed directly into his 
nervous system, and took its instruc- 
tions from his thoughts. He had 
lived with the implant for so long 
that it was part of him. He would 
have missed it if it did not work; 
but he had never liked it. 

“there is a message from 
CERES,” the voice said. 

“is SHE SAFE?” Aeneas thought. 
It was a ridiculous question; not 
even the base central computer had 
been given enough data to know 
who he meant, “cancel that 

QUESTION. HOW IS THE MESSAGE 
SIGNED?” 

“HOTLIPS.” 

Thank God, Aeneas thought. He 
was careful not to think that into the 
computer. His prayers were not 
meant for a machine, “i want the

dered. It would take a little longer,

“acknowledged.” 

“ask LAURIE JO TO COME TO 
ME.” 

— Pause — “DONE.” ' 

And now there was nothing to do 
but wait. He leaned back in the 
chair, smoothing his shock of 
white-gray hair with slender fingers. 
Even in Luna’s low gravity he felt 
his years. He had been forty when 
he came to the Moon, and even 
though Lunar gravity did not age 
men as much as Earth’s did, there 
had been little rest in the last quar- 
ter century. Not for Aeneas Mac- 
Kenzie. Presently he began to doze. 
Images formed in his mind.

Economists once thought there 
could never be a period of both in- 
flation and high unemployment. 
They were wrong. In the last third 
of the Twentieth Century both were 
normal conditions. With millions 
out of work, governments tried to 
buy their way to prosperity through 
deficit financing. They printed 
bonds and certificates and paper 
money and more paper money, and 
soon they were all worthless. 
Wages and prices spiraled. People 
who had saved all their lives found 
their savings worth nothing, less 
than nothing, and simply to live had 
to turn for aid to governments that 



had ruined them in the first place. 
The governments had to find more 
and more money, and the printing 
presses were cheap. The results 
were predictable, but no less disas- 
trous for being so. 

The democracies in particular 
faced an impossible dilemma. There 
wasn’t enough money to fiind both 
technological research and welfare 
programs. Technological research 
was expensive and directly em- 
ployed comparatively few people. 
Soon the space programs were cut 
back, cut again, cut once more. 
Meanwhile the anti -technology move- 
ments gained recruits. “Only One 
Earth.” “Alternate Technology.” 
“Appropriate Technology.” “Ecol- 
ogy.” Those slogans and a dozen 
like them became watchwords, and 
space programs, energy research, 
electronics research, all began to 
die. 

For a while private industries 
continued research programs, but 
soon the governments, desperate for 
more funds to spend on popular 
programs, raised taxes so high that 
there was nothing left for risk in- 
vestment. The companies cut back 
as had the governments; especially 
so as the consumer advocates forced 
the corporations to accept consumer 
representatives on their boards of 
directors, and the consumer rep- 
resentatives were almost universally 
dedicated against technology and 
technological “fixes.” 

'phen the United States was 
rocked by a series of scandals. Wa-

tergate began it, but the scars from 
that had not healed. before another 
scandal emerged, and another after 
that. The People’s Alliance rose to 
displace the traditional political par- 
ties, and swept into Washington as 
an irresistible reform movement. Its 
leader, Greg Tolland, and his man- 
ager, Aeneas MacKenzie, were the 
most popular political figures of the 
Century; but then MacKenzie, as 
Solicitor General of the United 
States, found the tentacles of the 
Equity Trust reached even into Greg 
Tolland’s office; and MacKenzie 
was both implacable and incorrupti- 
ble. The result was more loss of 
confidence, more disgust with 
democracy, more disillusionment 
among voters who now believed 
that the citizens could never control 
their government. 

While the United States was 
paralyzed by scandals, and the 
Soviet Union was rocked by 
nationalistic movements within its 
empire, a few international corpora- 
tions banded together to create the 
first industrial satellites and the first 
laser-launching system. The heiress 
Laurie Jo Hansen built the Heimdall 
industrial satellite and that proved 
so profitable that other companies 
first joined with Hansen Enterprises, 
then set up competing space indus- 
tries. Based in Zurich and Singa- 
pore and Hong Kong and other 
places of refuge from taxation, the 
international corporations moved 
into space even as governments 
found themselves unable to do so. 



Governments looked with envy 
on the high profits and great poten- 
tial of space industries. Tolland’s 
lieutenant, Aeneas MacKenzie, led 
the fight for US takeover of the 
Hansen empire, ensnarling Hansen 
Enterprises in a web of legal prob- 
lems, taxes, regulations, com- 
plexities; he might have ended with 
Hansen nationalized by the United 
States had not he found corruption 
in Tolland’s staff, and been forced 
from his office by the President he 
had created. MacKenzie had to flee 
for his life; and he had no place to 
go but to his enemies. From Tol- 
land’s Washington MacKenzie went 
to Laurie Jo Hansen; and because 
he had known Laurie Jo many years 
before, and because she with the 
whole world knew that Aeneas 
MacKenzie’ s pledged word was 
worth more than his life, he became 
first her consort, then her prime 
minister, finally her partner. 

Yet Tolland and the People’s Al- 
liance never forgot who had ruined 
Toland’s dreams of a country re- 
made by whatever means he thought 
were needed; his agents had been 
relentless in pursuit, until Laurie Jo 
sold out most of her empire to 
found Diana Station, and took her 
minister-consort to the Moon: Not 
even the President of the United 
States could follow them there.

And by now no one is interested 
in killing us, Aeneas thought. Ex-

power. The People’s Alliance pro- 
tected him from the scandals, but 
the real leadership doesn’t tmst 
him. Not any more. 

The office door opened without 
warning and he swiveled quickly. 
After more than twenty years he 
loved the sight of her. The red hair 
was dyed now, he suspected, but 
he had never asked and never would; 
and despite all the temptations of 
low gravity, she had kept her fi- 
gure. Her smile lit the office. 

“She’s safe,” Laurie Jo said. 

“For a while.” 

“Can’t you ever simply be happy 
without worrying about the future?” 
She did not wait for an answer. In- 
stead she crossed the office quickly 
and sat in his lap. They kissed with 
the affection that comes only from 
long friendship and love. Then 
Aeneas opened a desk drawer, took 
out papers from the computer 
printer concealed there and began to 
read. 

Although she desperately wanted 
to know what the message said, she 
did not read over his shoulder, but 
waited until he had finished the first 
sheet. He handed it to her without 
looking up and read the next. There 
were only two. Then he waited until 
she had finished. 

“They’re on Ceres,” Laurie Jo 
said. “With the cargo safe.” 

“And someone tried to kill her. 
At least twice. Someone knows,” 
Aeneas said. He cursed, softly. 
“I’m a fool. I underestimated the 
danger.” 



“She knew the risks,” Laurie Jo 
said. “And who else could we trust 
with something this important?” 

“It was a stupid plan. I should 
never have let her go.” 

Laurie Jo laughed. “Could you 
have stopped her?” she demanded. 
“No one could control us at her 
age, and she believes in this. You 
could not have stopped me when I 
was her age.” 

“God knows I couldn’t.” 

It had been so long ago. She’d 
been Laurie Jo Preston then, an or- 
phan girl living alone under the 
guardianship of bankers and sup- 
ported by trust funds. They’d met at 
UCLA when Aeneas was political 
manager for Greg Tolland. No one 
had ever heard of Greg Tolland 
then. The young Congressman, just 
beginning his meteoric career, was 
one of the founders of the tiny 
movement that would one day be 
the People’s Alliance, but then it 
was nothing more than a dream 
shared by Tolland and Aeneas. 

Aeneas and Laurie Jo Preston had 
two years. They lived together and 
hitchhiked across the nation, 
through Mexico and Baja. They 
sang and drank and made love and 
were happy with their dreams until 
her bankers came to tell her that her 
name was Hansen, not Preston, and 
that she had inherited one of the 
largest fortunes on Earth; then ev- 
erything changed. “I couldn’t con- 
trol you, and I almost lost you 
forever,” Aeneas said. 

“Hush.” She put a finger gently 

79 



EXILES TO GLORY 




on his lips, then bent to kiss him 
again. 

“I miss her,” Aeneas said. 

“I have missed her terribly from 
the day she decided to go to 
Earth,” Laurie Jo said. “But I’m 
proud of her.'’ 

“And so am I. Laurie Jo, I feel 
so helpless! Someone knows. If 
they tried to kill her once, they’ll 
try again. Before she even left 
Earth! And she didn’t tell us.” 
“Because we would have stopped 
her.” 

“It doesn’t make sense,” Aeneas 
said. “They tried to kill her before 
she ever got to the ship. And they 
tried to stop the ship from landing 
on Ceres. That makes no sense at 
all! We hadn’t expected trouble be- 
fore she got to Ceres. They need 
that cargo as much as we do — ” 
“My darling husband,” Laurie Jo 
said. “Use your brains. You’re let- 
ting this be too personal — ” 

“How could it be otherwise?” 

“ — and you’re making mistakes 
because of that. Someone wants to 
stop the ship from landing. They 
tri^. Perhaps it was Pacifico — have 
you asked for his dossier?” 
“Presently. Not yet.” 

“More likely someone else,” 
Laurie Jo said. “But whoever it 
was didn’t want Wayfarer to land at 
all. We hadn’t expected that.” 
“No.” Aeneas leaned back in his 
high-backed chair and pressed the 
tips of his fingers together. His eyes 
half closed, and his hands pressed 
gently together, drew apart, pressed 



together again. 

Laurie Jo smiled as she watched 
him. This was more to her liking. 
This was the man who had brought 
down a President. 

“So there’s another group work- 
ing in the Belt,” Aeneas said. 

“You don’t sound surprised.” 

“With billions at stake, I would 
not be surprised if everyone in the 
Belt were corrupt,” Aeneas said. 
“How many can resist that kind of 
temptation? When it is quite feasi- 
ble to offer bribes in the millions 
and still make fabulous profits? I 
expect this was done by the Afri- 
cans. They don’t fancy competition 
from asteroid mines.” 

“I don’t much blame them,” 
Laurie Jo said. There was sadness 
in her voice. “They don’t have any- 
thing to sell except their minerals, 
and we’re driving the price down 
and down.” 

Aeneas nodded. They’d discussed 
all this before. Ruin for the African 
bloc meant prosperity for the rest of 
the world; cheap iron and steel and 
copper and aluminum, the basic 
stuff of industrial civilization, 
would let billions live well who 
now had no hope at all. Eventually 
it would mean prosperity for the Af- 
ricans themselves, but not soon, and 
not for those who now controlled 
the African bloc. 

“So we are facing two sets of 
enemies,” Laurie Jo said. 

“Probably more. At least two. 
One group wishes to stop the ship- 
ments altogether. I doubt they have

finished. They’ll keep trying, but 
they won’t have many allies in the 
Belt. It’s the others I worry 
about — and George Lange is dead. 
She won’t have his help.” Aeneas 
leaned back again, his hands mov- 
ing slowly and gently. 

Laurie Jo waited. ‘‘Valkyrie 
STATUS REPORT.” The words 
formed in her head with no accent, 
but she always knew when she 
heard Aeneas speak to the comput- 
er, although she could not have told 
how that was different from hearing 
the computer report to her. 

‘‘ready for departure in five 
HUNDRED HOURS,” the Computer 
told them. 

‘‘earliest possible ARRIVAL 
TIME ON CERES?” 

‘‘one hundred and twenty 
DAYS FROM PRESENT TIME.” 

‘‘With Lange dead, we’ll have to 
send someone else,” Aeneas said. 

‘‘Who? There’s no one we can 
trust with something this important. 
And neither of us can go. Nothing 
has changed, Aeneas. We’re needed 
here. If we lose control now, there’s 
no point to any of this. We’ll lose 
everything we’ve worked hard for.” 
‘‘I know. We can only trust our- 
selves. Or the boy. Or we could 
give it all up.” 

‘‘Neither of us will.” 

‘‘No. Neither of us will.” 

She didn’t care for the tone he 
had used, and she looked at him 
sternly. He was leaning back again, 
his fingers moving in the familiar 
pattern that she knew meant he was 



lost in thought; and she was 
frightened even before he spoke 
again. 

‘‘There’s a better way,” he said. 
‘‘The boy’s more valuable here.” 
“No." Her voice rose. ‘‘I lost 
you for sixteen years once! And 
then almost lost you again, when 
we’d just found each other. I will 
not be separated from you again. I 
will not.” 

‘‘Laurie Jo.” His voice was very 
calm now. ‘‘You can manage the 
finances. You’re better at it than I 
am, and you must stay here; but 
I’ve outgrown my usefulness.” 
‘‘That’s not true, you’re the base 
commander — ” 

‘‘A function that Kit Penrose can 
fill as well as I can,” Aeneas said. 
‘‘And Kit can train young Aeneas, 
who will be far more useful here 
than floundering around out in the 
Belt. He’s not ready for this, Laurie 
Jo. I don’t think our daughter was 
ready either, but I know our son 
isn’t. He can help you, yes. He un- 
derstands boardroom tactics, and 
he’s becoming a better engineer 
than Kit, but he does not know in- 
trigue and corruption. Not yet.” 
‘‘Nor do you!” she shouted. 
‘‘Now really, Laurie Jo — ” 
‘‘Aeneas, it has been twenty 
years since you were Solicitor 
General — ” 

‘‘Laurie Jo.” His voice was quiet 
and his tone calm. 

‘‘And I won’t lose you again — ” 
‘‘I am still a very careful man,” 
Aeneas said. ‘‘There is not much

risk to me — and I am less valuable 
than our son. We cannot risk both 
heirs. If it is a choice between my- 
self and young Aeneas, there is no 
choice at all, nor would I be — ” He 
stopped, bepause her face had 
changed. 

She had lost her anger. Now her 
expression held only sadness. 

“You know I’m right,” he said. 
He was not insisting; he merely 
stated a fact they both understood. 
She nodded, then buried her face 
against his shoulder. 

“I love you,” she said. Then she 
tried once more, but only because 
she had to: “Couldn’t Kit go? 
Or—” 

“He couldn’t, and there is no one 
else. Not for this. Is there?” 

“No. You or our son.” 

“And thus me.” He kissed her 
gently. “We have twenty days. And 
when I return, we’ll have many 
more. I’ll come back, Laurie Jo. I 
always have.” 

“Yes,” she said, and she turned 
away from him quickly so that he 
would not see the glistening tears in 
her blue eyes. 

XIII 

Henri Stoire was a satisfied man, 
and what’s more, he was certain he 
had every right to be pleased with 
himself. Since he’d come to Ceres 
as Interplanet’s resident general 
manager, the output of the mines 
and refineries had tripled. The 
enormous mylar plastic mirror, over 



two kilometers in diameter, hung in 
synchronous orbit 760 kilometers 
above the asteroid, providing heat 
and light for the colony twenty-four 
hours a day (he still thought of days 
as having twenty-four hours even 
though Ceres rotates once each nine 
hours, five minutes). More miners 
arrived each month, the capacity of 
the refineries continued to expand, 
and a prospecting party had found a 
large vein of nearly pure water-ice 
deep under the surf^ace, thus insur- 
ing both drinking water and reaction 
fuel for the nuclear ships like Way- 
farer. 

Henri Stoire was satisfied, but his 
superiors were not. His production 
goals were set in Zurich by men 
who knew nothing of the conditions 
on Ceres, but who knew a lot about 
international competition, manipula- 
tion of commodity futures, and al- 
ways about banking and money; 
the goals they set were high. Of 
course, Henri thought, when he 
tried to be fair — not very often — the 
costs of the Ceres operation were 
very high as well. It took eleven 
new francs to get one kilogram 
from Earth’s surface to Earth orbit, 
a hundred more to get it to Ceres, 
and Ceres required thousands of 
metric tonnes of supplies, food, 
equipment, and men, always more 
men. The return had to be high or 
the investment couldn’t be justified. 

Henri met their ever-increasing 
production goals, but his costs were 
always higher than estimated. No 
incentive bonuses for Stoire, not 



82 



GALAXY 




this year. Perhaps when a full cargo 
from the Belt reached Earth or- 
bit .. even iron ore delivered to 
Earth orbit would be highly valu- 
able for more orbital factory con- 
struction. Iron in orbit would sell 
for almost Fr. 12,000 a metric 
tonne, and Henri had ten thousand 
tonnes to ship, along with one 
thousand tonnes of tin (Fr. 
6,720,000), fifteen hundred tonnes of 
nearly pure silver (Fr. 315,000,000) 
and a few hundred million francs’ 
worth of assorted other metals. The 
total value of the cargo he would 
shortly send down would be consid- 
erably more than half a billion 
francs; a respectable sum indeed. 
Now he had only to get the ship- 
ment to Earth. The incentive 
bonuses would follow. 

Actually, Interplanet’s bonuses 
interested Henri far less than his 
employers — or at least most of 
them — knew. True, Henri had 
enormous debts, the result of un- 
wise speculations; had he known as 
much about the international com- 
modity market as the men who set 
his production goals did, Henri 
would never have come to Ceres in 
the first place. His debts were fur- 
ther increased by Henri’s unfortu- 
nate addiction to chemin-de-fer and 
roulette, and his even less fortunate 
tendency to borrow money from any 
source available. He had been bom 
a rich man, of a great and wealthy 
family, and he had lost everything; 
he needed money. 

Although Zurich’s bonuses were 



not small by normal standards, 
Henri needed far more money than 
could be acquired by ordinary 
means. Had his employers known 
just how much money Henri owed, 
they would never have sent him to 
Ceres, or anywhere else; but his 
creditors were careful men who 
never advertised the names of those 
who borrowed from them; and they 
had many suggestions for Henri. 
There was no way, bonuses or not, 
that Henri could earn what he owed; 
but with any luck he would leave 
Ceres with his debts paid and more 
money than he had ever had in his 
life. If all that was merely a small 
part of the profits his creditors 
would make from his work, Henri 
was not an avaricious man. He truly 
believed that he asked for no more 
than he was entitled to, and cer- 
tainly he had high abilities. 

Henri was a small man, very neat 
in appearance. Even on Ceres he 
looked neat, and that was often very 
difficult. His small size was no 
handicap in space. In many ways it 
was a decided advantage. In low 
gravity long legs were mostly good 
for running into hard objects and 
otherwise getting in the way. 

Though small, Henri was no 
weakling. He exercised daily and he 
was always willing to give the men 
a hand with a tough job. Henri 
eould do the job of nearly any man 
in his employ; he took great pride 
in that, and it was certainly a useful 
ability. Some of his latest activities, 
those in favor of his creditors and

83

GALAXY 



unknown to his employers in 
Zurich, could not have been accom- 
plished if Henri had not understood 
every detail of the automated refin- 
ery operation, known how to con- 
struct conveyor systems, dig out 
chambers in rock with explo- 
sives. 

Those skills, though needed, 
were not the key to his plan for re- 
suming his place among the idle 
rich in Monte Carlo. More impor- 
tant than any of them was the study 
he had made of computer opera- 
tions. That was the key to it all, and 
it had gone so smoothly that had 
Henri been a superstitious man, he 
might have been frightened. 

Sometimes he was appalled by 
what he was doing. He felt no guilt 
about betraying the Directors of the 
Interplanet combine; if they paid 
him what he was worth, he would 
not have to resort to embezzlement 
(Henri preferred to think of it as 
misallocation of company resources, 
or even as a legitimate perquisite to 
his office). He felt no guilt, but he 
was sometimes disturbed by the 
sheer magnitude of the operation. 
Not only was something like one 
hundred million francs involved — 
and that was a large enough sum to 
impress even Henri Stoire — but also 
the follow-up implications would be 
even larger. Mankind had never 
succeeded in getting nuclear fusion 
to work on a commercial scale. Fis- 
sion worked fine and had since the 
1950’s, but the far more valuable 
and efficient fusion proccess con- 



tinued to be too expensive, too dif- 
ficult; and the result was a continu- 
ing energy crisis that affected nearly 
every nation on Earth. Fertilizer 
prices depended on energy prices, 
which meant that energy prices con- 
trolled how much the poor would 
eat. Cheap fusion would bring 
cheap food — and Henri was turning 
fusion over to a gang of interna- 
tional criminals. 

Still, he felt no guilt. If food was 
dear, it was because people were 
cheap. If the fools wished their 
children to eat well, let them either 
work to earn enough money or 
have fewer children. It was no con- 
cern of Henri’s what happened to 
children in India, Bangla-Desh, Af- 
rica, South America. 

Nor was he worried about being 
caught. As manager for Inteiplanet 
he controlled the only police force 
on Ceres. The company guards 
worked for him and took his orders. 
The accountants reported to him and 
could only gain access to the com- 
puter through him. They could ask 
Interplanet’s computer questions as 
long as they liked; even if they 
knew the real questions they should 
ask, it would not tell them without 
his authorization, and they didn’t 
know anyway. Besides, in a few 
weeks it would all be over, and 
there would be no record of what 
Henri had done. 

Henri Stoire sat at his desk, the 
only real desk on Ceres and a mark 
of his importance, and despite his 
satisfaction with himself and his 



EXILES TO GLORY 



85 




work, he frowned as he read the re- 
port brought to him by Captain 
Greiner. 

Wayfarer had arrived with cargo 
intact; excellent. But someone had 
tried to prevent. the ship from com- 
ing to Ceres, and that was not. 
Wayfarer's cargo was the key to 
everything. Without it they would 
never get all that iron and copper 
and tin and silver to Earth, ^^^o 
had done this? 

It took him only moments to 
dismiss Pacifico. The lawyer had 
been sent by Zurich, and was 
rumored to be a clever accountant 
as well. He would have been a nui- 
sance, and it was as well that he 
was dead; but he had almost cer- 
tainly not been responsible for 
nearly crippling Wayfarer. No. It 
was very likely that Pacifico’s part 
was exactly what he had said it 
was, a frightened man trying to 
keep Captain Greiner from taking 
high risks with the ship. 

Nor was it likely that the missing 
George Lange had been the 
saboteur. The Daedalus Corporation 
had far too much at stake, and they 
hired carefully. Daedalus was re- 
sponsible for getting Henri’s cargo 
safely back to Earth; the loss of one 
of their senior engineers would be 
inconvenient, possibly worse titan 
that. All true. But Daedalus had a 
deeper role in this game. Henri’s 
creditors had warned him that 
Daedalus, supposedly owned by 
other Zurich bankers and itself one 
of the stockholders in the consor- 



tium that created Interplanet, had its 
nose in far too many places. His 
creditors suspected that Daedalus 
worked for very powerful interests 
indeed — possibly even for MacKen- 
zie and Hansen; that Daedalus en- 
gineers were often spies reporting 
to Interplanet stockholders, and 
whenever they were around, Henri 
should be careful. The warning was 
appreciated but not needed; Henri 
was always careful. But it made it 
unlikely that Lange had tried to 
sabotage Wayfarer. Far more prob- 
ably Lange had been snooping 
around and had caught the saboteur, 
and was put outside the ship for his 
trouble. 

So who might it be? Henri scan- 
ned the passenger and crew lists. 
Anyone might be an African 
sympathizer — ^Henri had already 
concluded the African bloc was the 
most likely sponsor of the 
sabotage — ^and that would not 
necessarily show in the kind of re- 
sumes sent out with passengers. Or 
the saboteur could be working for 
money. He lifted a microphone. 

“ready,” the computer said. 

“l WANT COMPLETE DOSSIERS ON 
ALL PASSENGERS AND CREW ARRIV- 
ING ABOARD wayfarer. HIGHEST 
PRIORITY REQUEST TO ZURICH 
HEADQUARTERS. JUSTIFICATION: NE- 
CESSITY TO IDENTIFY SABO- 
TEUR.” 

‘ ‘ ACKNOWLEDGED. ’ ’ 

He returned to his scrutiny of the 
passenger list. He read names and 
specialties, paying no particular at- 



86 



GALAXY 




tention to what he saw, until he 
came to “Norsedal, Jacob. Com- 
puter Specialist. To be supervisor of 
computer operations, Interplanet.” 

He read it again, then cursed. 
Zurich had not told him of this! 
True, he had requested a new pro- 
grammer, but he was satisfied with 
his computer staff and its acting 
head. He had certainly not sent for 
any experts to take control; under 
his present arrangement Henri him- 
self was the real supervisor of com- 
puter operations, and he liked it that 
way. 

This could be bothersome, espe- 
cially now. Did Zurich suspect 
something? He would have to be 
very careful with this Norsedal. 
Was Norsedal curious? An agent of 
Zurich? He must be watched 
closely. Henri continued to scan the 
list. 

MacMillan, Ellen. Engineer, no 
employer. Henri smiled at that. 
Every ship brought two or three un- 
employed single women, and most 
claimed to be some kind of en- 
gineer. They might very well have 
their degrees, but generally they 
made a great deal more money in a 
far older occupation. He wondered 
where the MacMillan girl would go: 
to one of the established houses, or 
would she prey on the miners and 
prospectors and refinery workers 
from her own quarters? From curi- 
osity he lifted the microphone 
again, “i want a photograph of 
ELLEN MACMILLAN, PASSENGER ON 
WAYFARER.” 



“acknowledged.” 

A few seconds later the facsimile 
emerged from a slot at the side of 
his desk. He looked it over, smiling 
at the blonde hair and blue eyes, 
pug nose; a pretty girl, young, one 
who would command a high price, 
for a while. Then the smile faded. 
Was there something familiar about 
the face? Where might he have seen 
it before? 

No. He was certain he had never 
seen the girl. But she reminded him 
of someone. He did not know who, 
but it was disturbing. She reminded 
him of someone he feared. He 
laughed to himself, because he 
feared no one; but he kept the 
photograph and put a tick mark 
against her name on the list to re- 
mind him to take some care with 
her dossier when it arrived. 

Henri Stoire was a careful man 
indeed.

Kevin wandered through rock 
corridors, not quite lost but not en- 
tirely sure of where he was. He was 
somewhere inside the Ceres com- 
plex and as long as he did not go 
through an airtight door, he couldn’t 
be very far from the central area; 
but he was looking for Ellen and he 
didn’t have any idea of where to 
find her. 

When Wayfarer landed, the 
passengers had to help unload the 
ship and transfer cargo — most of the 



EXILES TO GLORY 



87 




cargo, Kevin reminded himself. 
One compartment remained sealed. 
When Kevin’s share of the work 
was over, many of the passengers 
had already gone inside. Kevin fol- 
lowed through the airlock doors, re- 
lieved to be Off the harsh and barren 
surface of the asteroid. No one 
would say that Ceres was a pretty 
place, although the stars were sp>ec- 
tacular; but Kevin had had enough 
stars to last him a long time. 

Why had Ellen left without tell- 
ing him where she was going? he 
wondered. He would have to report 
in for work soon, and they might 
not have much time together until 
he could find out where he would 
be stationed. Then they could ar- 
range something more permanent. 

The corridors shone. They had 
been painted with plastic to seal in 
air leaks, so that it was possible to 
move around inside the Ceres Sta- 
tion without a helmet. There were 
lights at intervals. Kevin hoped to 
see someone to ask directions from, 
but before he did, he came to a 
signpost. 

It showed DAEDALUS CORPORATE 
OFFICES just one corridor down. 
Kevin went there eagerly. They 
could tell him where he would be 
staying. 

There was an elderly man in the 
Daedalus Corporation offices. The 
offices themselves were merely two 
rooms cut in raw rock off the cor- 
ridor. They were obviously little 
used; there was almost no furniture, 
and an automatic message-recording 



system was the only piece of large 
office equipment. 

The man was well over fifty, 
with a network of red lines around 
his mouth and chin that betrayed 
long exposure to face masks. He 
had wrinkles at the corners of his 
eyes, and much gray in his hair. He 
frowned at Kevin. “You’ll be 
Senecal.’’ 

“Yes.” 

“I’m John Eliot. Senior man for 
Daedalus out here. You got our 
other people with you?” 

“No—” 

“You should have. You’re an 
engineer. It’s your responsibility to 
look after non-professional em- 
ployees. Now we’ll have to go find 
them. We don’t have much time. 
Time, Senecal, is the most valuable 
commodity in the Belt just now.” 
“Yes, sir. Look, Mr. Eliot — ” 
“Call me Johnny. We’ll either be 
friends or you’ll hate me before 
long, but either way, it works better 
if we use first names.” 

“Johnny. Yes, sir. I am Kevin.” 
vin.” 

“Yeah. 1 know. You were saying 
something?” 

“Mr. — ^Johnny, this is my first 
job. I’m no professional. I’m just 
an engineering student, and the idea 
of my looking after people twice 
my age is funny. They wouldn’t 
take orders from me.” 

“We’ll see. Did they get on all 
right with Lange?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Too bad about him,” Eliot said. 



88 



GALAXY 




“What happened, anyway?” 

Kevin explained all he knew. 
“George just vanished,” he 
finished. “Never did find him, no 
trace of him. Nothing.” 

“His stuff missing?” 

“No,” Kevin said. “Captain 
Greiner has it. He didn’t know what 
to do with it.” 

“We’ll collect it before we go 
up. May as well see to that, and to 
finding our workmen. You can 
leave that gear here.” 

“All right.” Kevin set down the 
travel cases he carried and started to 
go out into the corridor. 

“Nope,” Eliot said. “Get your 
hat. Didn’t they teach you that? 
First rule, never go anywhere with- 
out your helmet. We don’t often 
have blowouts on Ceres, but it only 
takes one to kill you if you don’t 
have your hat with you. Remember 
that.” 

“Yes, sir.” Kevin retrieved his 
helmet, then thoughtfully put on his 
tool belt as well. 

“Good,” Eliot said. “Now let’s 
go.” He led the way through the 
bare rock corridor. “They’ll prob- 
ably be at Fat Jack’s,” Eliot said. 
“Most head there when they get off 
work or off a ship. Surprised you 
didn’t get there first.” 

“I was hoping someone would 
tell me where I will be staying,” 
Kevin said. “I didn’t see any 
hotels — ’ ’ 

Eliot laughed. “Hell, you won’t 
be staying on Ceres.” 

“Sir? Johnny? If we won’t be 



staying on Ceres, where will we 
be?” 

“Didn’t Lange tell you any- 
thing?” Eliot demanded. “Don’t 
you even know what you’ll be 
working on?” 

“No, sir. I asked once, and he 
said I’d find out in due time. But I 
never did.” 

Eliot laughed. “Well, that was 
the company’s orders all right, but 
it’s damn foolishness. Everybody on 
Ceres knows our big secret, not that 
it’s anything to be secret about 
anyway. Daedalus is responsible for 
the delivery system to get cargo to 
Earth. We’re building it. I expect 
Lange kept everything about that a 
big secret too?” 

“Yes—” 

“Okay. Up there about a 
thousand kilometers above Ceres 
there’s a rock a couple of hundred 
meters in diameter. It’s mostly 
nickel-iron, good stuff. We’re bus- 
ily mining out corridors and putting 
in life-support systems. When we’re 
done, we’ll pack it with all the re- 
fined minerals Interplanet has col- 
lected and take it home.” 

“Take a two-hundred-meter rock 
home? How?” Kevin demanded. 
“It must weigh five million 
tonnes — ’ ’ 

“Thirty million,” Eliot said. 
“Hell, it’s simple. We put hydro- 
gen bombs at just the right place — 
have to calculate the center of grav- 
ity pretty carefully — and light ’em 
off. Do that a few times and we’ll 
have that rock in just the right

transfer orbit. Off she goes to 
Earth. Down there they do it again 
to stop it. No sweat.” Eliot chuck- 
led. He was obviously enjoying the 
look on Kevin’s face. “Lange really 
didn’t tell you, eh? Well, that’s 
what we’re tip to. You brought the 
bombs with you, on Wayfarer. 
That’s why everybody got so ex- 
cited down here when we heard you 
were in trouble. Needed the 
H-bombs. Without ’em, we’d really 
have troubles. No other way to get 
all that stuff home.” 

“And somebody’s going to ride 
this thing to Earth?” Kevin asked. 

“Sure. Safest place around. 
There’ll be a couple of hundred 
meters of nickel-iron and rock be- 
tween the crew and the bombs — 
what could happen?” 

That made sense, but Kevin still 
didn’t like the idea much. “Are we 
supposed to be the crew?” 

“Naw. Interplanet provides the 
crew. They wouldn’t trust a half- 
billion francs’ worth of cargo to 
anybody but their own people. Un- 
derstand the manager, Mr. Stoire 
himself, is going. Guess I can’t 
blame them much.” 

They moved on through the rock 
corridor. In Ceres’s low gravity 
they couldn’t walk, nor could they 
simply glide from place to place as 
they would in no gravity at all. In- 
stead they moved in a series of 
bounds, like oversized kangaroos. 

They came to a cross corridor, 
and Eliot turned down it. There 
were bright lights at the end, their 



glare contrasting with the dim light 
in the corridor. They heard sounds: 
shouting and singing. Happy 
sounds. 

“That’s Fat Jack’s place,” Eliot 
said. “Best bar on Ceres. Mainly 
because it’s the only bar here. Pret- 
ty good place, though. You can get 
nearly anything you want. Not that 
you’ll be here all that often.” 

Kevin had already thought of 
that. “Don’t we get to come — down 
to Ceres?” 

“Sure, the company provides re- 
creation trips when we’re caught up 
on the work. Don’t cost that much 
to run the scooters.” 

It looked as if everyone who had 
come in Wayfarer, and half the 
permanent crew of Ceres, were 
packed into Fat Jack’s. The pro- 
prietor was a burly man with no legs. 
When one of the newcomers asked 
why he hadn’t gone back to Earth, 
the owner laughed. 

“Sure, they’ll pay my way back 
and give me a goddam pension, but 
I don’t want it. What the hell use is 
a cripple on Earth? Out here I don’t 
need legs.” He waved to indicate 
the crowd in his saloon. “I make 
my own beer and whiskey and I get 
good prices. I’ve got a thousand 
friends. What do I want with 
Earth?” 

The saloon consisted of a large 
chamber carved from rock, a few 
tables and booths, and one long bar 
running across the back of the 
room. 

All the drinks were served in 



90 



GALAXY 




covered containers with straws, al- 
though most of the customers had 
learned the art of popping open the 
top, sucking out a drink, and clos- 
ing it before their beer or whiskey 
drifted away. 

Kevin pointed out the Daedalus 
employees, and Eliot went to round 
them up. While Kevin was waiting, 
Ellen came in. Bill Dykes was with 
her. 

“Hi,” Kevin shouted. He went 
over to them. “Glad I found you. 
They want me to go up to one of 
Ceres’s moons — ” 

“C-4,” Dykes said. “The one 
they’re fitting up as a spaceship.” 

“Right. How did you know?” 
Kevin asked. 

Dykes shrugged. “No secret what 
Daedalus does. Everybody on Ceres 
knows about the H-bombs. Wonder 
why they were so damn close- 
mouthed aboard Wayfarer!" 

“Well, they are hydrogen 
bombs,” Kevin said. 

“Sure. And bombs can kill 
people. Lots of other ways to get 
killed out here. I need a drink. 
You, Ellie?” 

“Yes, thank you.” 

Dykes went to fight his way to 
the bar. 

“I get some recreation visits,” 
Kevin said. “1 won’t see you often 
at first, only when I’m down. 
Where will you "be staying?’ ’ 

“I — I’ll be staying with Bill,” 
Ellen said. 

It took Kevin a moment to under- 
stand what she had said. “In 



his—” 

“Yes, I’ll be living with him.” 

“But — damn it, he’s old enough 
to be your father!” Kevin shouted. 
He wanted to say more: That at first 
she had put him off because she 
didn’t want lasting attachments, and 
now they were lovers, and what 
was this? Bitterness made him say 
more: “I get it. He can pay you 
more than I can.” 

“It’s none of your damned busi- 
ness,” she said. She spoke loudly, 
so that many of the people in the 
bar could hear her. “You don’t own 
me and you have no right to make 
judgments.” 

“No. I don’t suppose I do,” 
Kevin said. “Except — except that I 
thought we were friends.” 

“If you’re my friend, you don’t 
act much like it,” Ellen said. 

“Trouble, Ellie?” Dykes was 
back, without the drinks he’d gone 
after. 

“Not really,” she said. 

“Kevin. Are you about ready to 
leave?” John Eliot called. 

“Yes. I’ll wait for you outside,” 
Kevin said. He turned and left 
without looking at Ellen. 

“Hell, this place is getting to be 
a drag,” Bill Dykes said. His voice 
carried through the room and out to 
where Kevin stood. “Let’s split and 
throw our own party.” 

“All right,” Ellen giggled. It 
was obvious what kind of party 
Dykes had in mind. She followed 
the miner out. They came past Ke- 
vin, and as they did, Ellen said, very 



EXILES TO GLORY 



91 





quietly, “Kevin. Please. I know 
you don’t understand, but please 
trust me. And for God’s sake, don’t 
let anyone know I’ve said anything 
to you. Make people believe you 
hate me.’’ With that she went on 
without looking back, and when 
Dykes made a loud ribald comment 
about Kevin, she laughed. 

« « * 

Ceres has five moons, if you can 
call small rocks a few hundred me- 
ters in diameter “moons.” Three of 
them had been extensively mined, 
but two had been temporarily aban- 
doned when better grades of ore 
were found on Ceres itself. The 
other one, C-4, was Kevin’s home 
for the next few weeks. 

There was plenty of work and not 
enough people to do it. First, the as- 
teroid had to be surveyed to find the 
exact center of gravity. Once that 
was located, a pit was to be dug for 
the hydrogen bombs that would be 
used to turn the tiny moon into an 
enormous rocket ship. On the oppo- 
site side the Daedalus crew would 
carve out chambers for the crew to 
live in, more compartments for the 
gold and silver and copper and 
other refined metals produced on 
Ceres. Meanwhile, another crew 
would set up huge mirrors on C-4 
and use those to concentrate sun- 
light so they could boil and refine 
the ores extracted from the 
planetoid. “No point in wasting 
anything,” Eliot had said. 



92 



GALAXY 



When they were finished, C-4 
would cany a cargo worth half a 
billion francs. In addition, the as- 
teroid itself would be valuable — 
nearly ten million metric tonnes of 
nickel-iron which would end up in 
Earth orbit. Refineries there would 
extract the iron to use in space con- 
struction. Even the twenty million 
tonnes of rock would be useful in 
orbit. The asteroid could be used as 
a platform. 

Kevin’s job was installation of 
the life-support equipment for the 
flight crew. With the help of miners 
and a lot of mining machinery, he 
hollowed out the crew chambers, 
then sprayed them with a thick coat- 
ing of plastic; when the plastic dried, 
the chambers were airtight. Airlock 
doors were machined from chunks 
of the moonlet itself, and set on 
hinges. Sometimes the whole struc- 
ture reminded Kevin more of a 
series of bank vaults than a space- 
ship; everything was massive, and 
rather crudely made. 

There were no work shifts, there 
was simply a job that had to be 
done. Eliot explained what was 
needed and was available for con- 
sultation. Otherwise he left Kevin 
alone. When one task was com- 
pleted Eliot would check it out, 
then assign another. 

Kevin found the job exacting, but 
it was important work, and ev- 
eryone was enthusiastic about it. 
They were taking part in something 
that might change man’s future. 

“Think about it,” Eliot said. “If 



we can get all of Earth’s metals out 
here, they won’t have to strip-mine 
on Earth. No pollution down there. 
You know, in fifty years Earth can 
be one big park, with all the indus- 
tries out in space.” 

Kevin became lost in a maze of 
calculations: food, oxygen, and 

water consumption for a crew of 
two (with standby provision for 
three) on a trip four hundred days 
long; g stresses which the equip- 
ment would endure when the one- 
megaton H-bombs went off; finding 
stress seams in the nickel-iron 
moonlet so they could be rein- 
forced. Slowly the “ship” began to 
look like something that could sup- 
port human life, with fuel cells for 
electric power, caves of ice for 
water and cooling, telescopes and 
radar for finding the exact position; 
navigation computer, galley, bunk 
rooms — with a separate stateroom 
for each of the crew, there being no 
space limits at all. 

Finally Eliot relented and took 
the work crew down to Ceres. They 
went in a scooter much like the one 
used to get from the Earth satellite 
to Wayfarer: an open framework 
with seats for the passengers, a 
baggage compartment, and a large 
kerosene-oxygen rocket engine. The 
scooters also had a navigation com- 
puter; C-4 moved around Ceres at 
more than a third of a kilometer 
each second, and the total velocity 
change needed to get from the 
“moon” to Ceres was more than 
eight hundred miles an hour. The 



EXILES TO GLORY 



93 




transfer orbit was tricky. 

Kevin talked with the scooter 
pilot in Fat Jack’s after they arrived 
on Ceres. 

“Yeah, sure, I could eyeball it,’’ 
Hal Donnelly said. “But it’d be 
tough. Not like flying an airplane.” 
Donnelly had once been a test pilot, 
and would be one of the crew ac- 
companying C-4 on the long trip to 
Earth. “Airplanes have air to work 
with. You can turn a comer, or 
slow down. Scooter doesn’t work 
that way.” 

Kevin wasn’t really listening to 
the pilot. He was thinking about El- 
len. There had been so much work 
on C-4 that he hadn’t had much 
time to brood about her before — 
except when he was ready to go to 
sleep at night — but he had felt a 
quick excitement when Eliot an- 
nounced they were going down to 
Ceres, arid he hoped to see her. He 
didn’t know what to say to her, but 
there had to be some way — 

He didn’t know how to ask about 
her. He was afraid of what he 
would hear. His fellow workers on 
C-4 had talked about the various 
prostitutes on Ceres, and although 
none of them had mentioned Ellen 
by name, they all assumed that any 
single woman who came out not 
under contract to one of the com- 
panies could have only one purpose 
in mind. 

Why the hell was she living with 
Bill Dykes? She’d hardly spoken to 
Dykes on the ship. She certainly 
hadn’t known him very well, yet 



she moved in with him her first day 
on Ceres. It didn’t make sense. 

Of course it makes sense, Kevin 
thought. She likes the guy and I just 
didn’t know it. She’s got every 
right to move in with anybody she 
wants to and you’ve got no call to 
be jealous about it. She said every- 
thing would be over when they got 
to Ceres. It was just a shipboard 
thing. He could tell himself that, 
but it didn’t help. 

“You haven’t heard a damned 
thing I said,” Hal Donnelly said. 
“You drink my liquor but you don’t 
listen to me.” The pilot was grin- 
ning slightly. 

“Oh — uh, sorry,” Kevin said. 

“No sweat. I know what you 
need. I’m about to go looking for a 
little poon myself. I know a good 
house. Want to come along?” 

The idea was not attractive. 
Kevin still hoped to meet Ellen. He 
knew that wasn’t very reasonable, 
and that she was likely to be with 
someone else, but there was always 
a chance — “Thanks, Hal. Not just 
yet. I’ll have a couple more.” 

The pilot shrugged. “Suit your- 
self. We lift out of here in thirty- 
four hours. Meet you here.” 

“Right. And thanks for the 
drink.” 

“’S okay. You’ll get me one next 
time. Right now I’ve got a more 
urgent urge. ...” Hal grinned again 
and left the bar. 

And just what the hell am I doing 
here? Kevin wondered. I don’t 
know anybody in this place. He or- 



94 



GALAXY 




dered another drink. The vacuum- 
distilled whiskey was rough and 
strong and cost too much. Kevin 
sipped at it disconsolately. 

He didn’t want to leave because 
Fat Jack’s was the place where ev- 
eryone came to find people. The rec- 
reation schedule for the C-4 crew 
was known and posted in Fat 
Jack’s: If Ellen wanted to see him, 
she’d know where to find him. 

Jacob Norsedal came into the bar. 
“Hello,” he said. He took a place 
across from Kevin. There was no 
real need to sit in Ceres’s low grav- 
ity, but the habit dies hard; and it is 
convenient to anchor yourself in one 
place. “I’ve been computing the 
trajectory your moonlet will take 
back to Earth.” 

“I’m still not sure this will 
work,” Kevin said. 

Norsedal looked surprised. “Of 
course it will. Think of it as a fu- 
sion spacedrive. Plenty of energy in 
a megaton. One million tons of 
TNT, ten-to-the-twenty-second ergs 

“I wasn’t thinking about the 
energy,” Kevin said. “It’s the 
navigation. We can’t really locate 
the center of gravity all that well — 
too much guesswork.” 

“Run it off,” Norsedal said. He 
offered his belt computer. “Takes a 
lot of energy to get that much iron 
to rotate. So they’re off a little — 
you’ve got little tamped-implosion 
kiloton bombs to correct that, and 
the rocket motors for fine adjust- 
ment.” 



“Yeah, I’ve seen the numbers,” 
Kevin said. “It looks silly as hell, 
mounting big rocket engines on the 
ground. Big things.” The four 
Saturn-sized rocket engines were 
mounted in a cruciform pattern, 
pointing away from the center of 
the cross. They would be used to 
turn C-4 in the right direction. “But 
it’s still using bombs,” Kevin said. 

Norsedal shrugged. It was obvi- 
ous that to him bombs were just 
another device to channel energy; it 
was doubtful that he thought of 
them as bombs at all, or even im- 
agined the real devices. They were 
more input numbers into his equa- 
tions, data to be fed into the com- 
puter. “Have you seen much of 
Ceres?” Jacob asked. 

“No. I was only here a few 
hours after Wayfarer landed, and 
this is my first trip down since.” 
“Well, I know a good place to 
eat,” Norsedal said. “The food in 
the Interplanet commissary is all 
right, but it’s nothing to rave about. 
1 can find some real steaks — ” 
“Steaks! Terrific. We’ve been 
eating reconstituted stew. And tex- 
tured vegetable proteins. And — ” 

. “Spare me those horrors,” Nor- 
sedal said. He patted his ample 
belly. “If I had to eat that way. I’d 
waste to nothing. Come on, let’s 
get a good dinner.” He hustled 
Kevin out of the bar and off to one 
of the rock corridors. 

Ceres was honeycombed with 
passages. Some were still used as 
working mines. Others were aban-

doned mine shafts, now used as part 
of the living quarters. There were 
airlocks at intervals along the cor- 
ridors. 

Jacob led the way through a maze 
of passages, and soon they were a 
long way from the inhabited parts 
of Ceres Station. 

“Where the hell are we going?” 
Kevin demanded. 

“Short cut.” Norsedal continued 
to scurry along. As he’d predicted 
when Kevin first met him, his 
weight and ungainly appearance 
were no handicaps in low gravity. 
They turned another comer and 
went upward. There was an airlock 
there. 

Jacob came very close to Kevin 
and spoke softly, almost a whisper. 
“We’re going outside now. Please, 
just follow me, and don’t use your 
suit radio whatever you do.” 

“But — why?” Kevin kept his 
voice low to match Norsedal’ s. 

“Will you trust me? It’s impor- 
tant.” 

Kevin nodded. He’d known Nor- 
sedal through the whole trip out; 
whatever Jacob was doing, it wasn’t 
dishonest. He put on his helmet. 

Norsedal opened the airlock and 
they went through the double doors. 
It was night outside on Ceres, but 
the overhead synchronous satellite 
mirror left the surface bathed in 
light. Down in the crevasse where 
the airlock opened they could see 
only by starlight, and Norsedal did 
not use a flash. He led the way, 
Kevin following closely. 



Then he turned into a cavern so 
deep that there was no light at all. 
He went on, downward, and turned 
a comer before he switched on a 
flash. Then he gestured, finger to 
lips, and went around another turn. 

There was an inflatable shelter 
there with its own airlock. The 
outer door stood open. Jacob ges- 
tured toward it, then followed 
Kevin in. There was the hiss of 
pumps and the airlock chamber 
pressurized, then the inner door 
opened. 

Ellen MacMillan was inside.

“I don’t think anyone noticed 
us leaving,” Norsedal said. “But 
I’ll have to get back quickly. I have 
to go on duty in the computer 
center.” 

Kevin hardly heard him. He was 
staring at Ellen. He thought she was 
lovely. “But — ” 

“We’ll explain,” she said. “I 
wanted to keep you out of this, Ke- 
vin, but I can’t. I need help. Will 
you help me?” 

“I’ll try. But—” 

“Yes. It’s such a long story, 1 
don’t know where to begin,” she 
said. “Kevin, I didn’t come here to 
work as an engineer. Or to be a 
prostitute, either.” 

“I never thought that,” Kevin 
said quickly. 

“That’s sweet of you. But I hope 
everybody else does,” she said. 
“I’m really not very good at the se-

cret-agent business. Kevin, I — I 
work for some of the owners of In- 
terplanet. For Hansen Enterprises. 
They have a contract for all the Ar- 
thurium mined in the Belt.” 

Arthurium. One of the super- 
heavy elements. In the first quarter 
of the Twentieth Century scientists 
thought there were only ninety-two 
elements. Then the nuclear en- 
gineers discovered they could make 
plutonium, and californium, and a 
host of other elements heavier than 
uranium-92, but all the new ele- 
ments were unstable. Finally a sta- 
ble natural element, atomic number 
of 124, was discovered. In the years 
that followed other 'super-heavy 
elements were found, but only in 
trace amounts. The super- heavies 
were in the cores of planets, and 
planetary cores are hard to get to: 
thousands of miles underground. 

Ceres was only a couple of 
hundred miles in radius, but had 
once "^een the core of a much larger 
planet: there were super-heavy ele- 
ments in abundance. Abundance is 
a relative term, of course: The su- 
pers are still very rare, found only in 
fractions-of-a-percent concentration; 
but they were available, and the 
most valuable of all was Arthurium, 
a member of the Tin-Niobium fami- 
ly, with the property of being 
superconductive at temperatures far 
higher than any other known super- 
conductors. 

‘‘And somebody is stealing the 
Arthurium,” Jacob Norsedal said. 
‘‘I’m sure of it.” 



‘‘That’s what I came out to look 
into,” Ellen said. “When the man- 
ager here reported only a few kilo- 
grams of Arthurium had been extract- 
ed, we wondered. Understand, it 
might have been true. Arthurium is 
very rare. But from the original 
assay figures, we thought there 
should be hundreds of kilograms of 
Arthurium, and we — Hansen Enter- 
prises — needs it. Hansen scientists 
think they can solve the fusion 
problem if they have enough!” 

Kevin found a place to sit. The 
shelter wasn’t well furnished; in 
fact it wasn’t furnished at all; but 
there were several boxes of gear 
stacked at one end next to the 
pumps and air supply, and Kevin 
found a perch on them. He tried to 
digest the information he’d been 
given. Fusion power would be 
priceless. And Arthurium, the little 
that was known to exist, sold for 
over a hundred thousand francs per 
kilogram. Hundreds of millions of 
francs, perhaps billions, were at 
stake here. 

“What do you want with me?” 
he asked. His voice was harsh. 

“Why are you angry?” Ellen 
asked. 

He didn’t say anything. 

“Dykes,” Jacob Norsedal prompt- 
ed. 

“Oh.” Ellen smiled. “Kevin, 
Bill Dykes has known my father 
for — since long before I was born. 
He worked for Hansen Enterprises 
on the Moon. When I needed a 
place to stay, I had to ask him, be-

cause I was afraid someone here 
might suspect me, and I didn’t want 
anyone else to get hurt. They killed 
George Lange, don’t forget. I have 
no right to ask your help, but I 
don’t know where else to go.” 

‘‘You mean — ” Kevin’s grin was 
broad and jheepish. ‘‘And I almost 
drove myself crazy thinking about 
you and — ” 

‘‘I’m sorry.” 

‘‘I have to get back,” Norsedal 
said. ‘‘If anyone asks. I’ll say you 
didn’t want steak after all and went 
to find a cat house. 1 doubt that 
anyone is interested in you, Kevin, 
but they might be and it’s best to 
have a story.” 

‘‘I must be stupid,” Kevin said. 
‘‘1 don’t know where you fit into 
this, Jacob.” 

‘‘He’s an honest man,” Ellen 
said. 

‘‘I was hired by the Zurich 
office,” Norsedal said. ‘‘And I’m 
supposed to report directly to them 
if I find anything wrong. Not that 
Zurich is suspicious of the man- 
agement here, but with all that 
money at stake, they wanted an in- 
dependent check — to make cer- 
tain.” 

‘‘Just as we did,” Ellen said. 
‘‘Only we were suspicious.” 

‘‘And you found something?” 
Kevin asked. 

‘‘Yes.” Norsedal nodded vigor- 
ously. ‘‘There are whole memory 
areas in the computer banks that I 
can’t access. And the programs run 
too long. That means the computer 



is following instructions that don’t 
appear in the flow diagrams. I 
haven’t found out what’s going on 
yet, but I think I will. I managed to 
get a print-out of the computer’s 
core, all the instructions. They’re in 
binary of course, so it takes time to 
analyze what I have, but I’m sure 
there are operations going on that 
don’t appear in the log. Mining op- 
erations, for example.” 

‘‘And in the refinery,” Ellen 
said. ‘‘It wouldn’t take much to 
cover up a few hundred kilograms 
missing among all the thousands of 
tons of rock they process, tons of 
gold they’ve extracted — ” 

‘‘And the refinery is nearly au- 
tomatic,” Norsedal added. ‘‘I can 
use the computer to find out just 
who might be involved by analyzing 
the work schedules, but I’ve been 
afraid to do that until I know just 
who’s been using it and for what. It 
might be programmed to tell 
whenever people ask that kind of 
question.” Norsedal went to the air- 
lock and squeezed through the nar- 
row inner door. ‘‘Good luck.” He 
closed the lock and started the 
pumps. 

‘‘How does he — why are you two 
working together?” Kevin asked. 
‘‘Are you sure you can trust him?” 

‘‘Yes. Henri Stoire, the manager, 
sent for dossiers on all the 
passengers aboard Wayfarer. They 
came twenty hours ago, and Jacob 
had to pass them along — but he fig- 
ured out who I am from my resume 
sheets.” 



98 



GALAXY 




“If he could, so can Stoire — ” 

“I know,” Ellen said. She 
sounded worried. “That’s why I’m 
here. I don’t know what to do. Ever 
since Stoire got the dossiers, there’s 
been no communication from Ceres 
to Earth. The equipment has mal- 
functioned, Stoire says — but Jacob 
says it hasn’t.” 

“And who are you?” Kevin de- 
manded. 

“Do you really want to know — 
no. Please, Kevin. I don’t want to 
tell you.” 

“All right.” He went to her and 
held out his arms. After a moment 
she crossed the tiny distance that 
remained and kissed him. 

“Not very passionate in these 
pressure suits,” Ellen laughed. 

“We could — ” 

She looked at him sharply. 

“Oh, hell,” he said. “You 
wanted my help. I won’t complicate 
things by — Ellen, I think I’ve been 
in love with you for a long time. 
Damn it, I know 1 am. Why else 
would it have bothered me so much 
when I thought you were living 
with Bill Dykes, maybe being — ” 

She cut him off with another 
kiss. “We can talk about this later. 
And we will. We really will. But 
now — ” 

“What is it you need?” 

“1 have to set up communications 
to reach off Ceres,” she said. “Ev- 
erything happened so fast! I was 
here for weeks, and I didn’t really 
learn anything. Bill Dykes thought 
there was something strange hap- 



pening at the refinery, but he 
couldn’t be sure. They’re very care- 
ful who they let work there. I didn’t 
really have anything to report, noth- 
ing solid to be suspicious about, 
until Jacob came to tell me about 
discrepancies he found in the com- 
puter log. Now I’ve got to get a 
message to the Moon.” 

“How?” Kevin demanded. 

“Bill and Jacob got this equip- 
ment,” she said. “Bill knew about 
this shelter, and Jacob was able to 
cover the communications gear by 
listing it as lost in the computer in- 
ventory. So we have enough elec- 
tronics and power supply to set up a 
high-gain antenna and get off our 
message, only there’s too much for 
me to do by myself. Jacob isn’t 
very good at outside work and he’d 
be missed if he didn’t show up. 
And Bill thinks they’ve been watch- 
ing him ever since he began asking 
questions. A few hours ago they 
gave him a special overtime as- 
signment, that’s not unusual, and if 
he didn’t take it, they’d know some- 
thing was wrong — so I couldn’t 
think of anyone to help, and Jacob 
knew the scooter would be down 
from C-4 and he went to find you 
and I hoped you would help me — ” 
“Shhh. Of course I’ll help you.” 
At that moment Kevin would have 
done anything for her, including 
digging a hole all the way through 
to the other side of Ceres. He de- 
cided that he liked being in love.

The gear was heavy. Weight is 
not a very meaningful concept in 
gravity as low as Ceres’s, but even 
in low gravity things have mass; 
large things are hard to start mov- 
ing, and just as hard to stop. The 
surface of Ceres is rugged: the as- 
teroid has been battered by colli- 
sions with other rocks for billions of 
years, and there is no atmosphere to 
smooth out the craters and crags the 
constant bombardment creates. Car- 
rying several hundred pounds of 
equipment — even when it only 
“weighs” thirty pounds or so — is 
not easy. 

Ellen had gotten from Bill Dykes 
a map of the area around Ceres Sta- 
tion itself, and Dykes had selepted a 
plateau three kilometers away as the 
best location for the transmitter. It 
was cut off from the Station by high 
peaks, but had a good visibility to 
space. They struggled across the 
crags and craters with their enor- 
mous loads, using their flashlights 
sparingly, and not talking at all. 

Despite the hard work, Kevin felt 
exuberant, filled with Joy and 
love — and hatred for whomever was 
trying to thwart the development of 
fusion power. Kevin remembered 
the energy shortages in his child- 
hood, and although he knew that 
what he had called poverty would 
have been fabulous wealth to much 
of the world, he could remember 
the hard times he had grown up in. 
Fusion could change much of that 
for the whole world, and it was in 
danger from selfish people who 



only wanted money. 

They reached the plateau. Kevin 
came close to Ellen and put his 
helmet to hers. “We can’t get this 
done without communication,” he 
said. 

“Yes. I guess we’ll just have to 
risk using our suit radios at lowest 
power. I don’t think anyone is look- 
ing for us. Why would they be?” 

“No reason,” Kevin said, but he 
worried anyway. They opened the 
cases and took out a collapsible an- 
tenna. The elements bolted together 
to form a large aprabolic dish which 
could be pointed toward Earth. 

The work was maddening. Each 
nut and bolt seemed a live thing, 
ready to slip from their heavy 
gloves and fall to vanish in the deep 
shadows. Connectors and parts 
which would have been simple to 
work with inside with plenty of 
light became complex puzzles, 
shapes not recognizable from the in- 
struction diagrams. 

“Putting together Christmas 
toys,” Ellen said as she searched 
for a large part that had somehow 
simply vanished in shadow although 
it couldn’t be more than a meter 
away. 

Eventually they got it done, and 
began to set up the telescope and 
quadrant they would use to point 
the antenna toward Earth’s Moon. 

“Earth’s still below the hori- 
zon,” Kevin said as they leveled 
the telescope platform. “I think 
we’re going to make it. Ellen, tell 
me something.” 



100 



GALAXY 




“Yes?” 

“You didn’t grow up in any or- 
phanage. They don’t assemble 
Christmas toys in foster homes and 
orphanages.” 

“Yes they—” 

“And you said the first day I met 
you that your father — ‘Daddy’ you 
called him — made you study gym- 
nastics.” 

“Oh. I’d forgotten I told you 
that,” she said. “We — I was dis- 
tracted at the time.” She laughed 
softly. 

“So who are you?” Kevin asked. 

“Oh come now, Mr. Senecal.” 
The voice was a man’s, cultured, 
and entirely strange to Kevin. Kevin 
jumped in a startled reaction and al- 
most upset the telescope. “Haven’t 
you guessed that yet? Allow me to 
introduce you to Miss Glenda 
Hansen-MacKenzie . ’ ’ 

There were two men on the 
plateau with them. One held a small 
rifle, the other a pistol. “Please 
keep your hands where I can see 
them,” the smaller intruder said. 
“Sorry to interrupt you, but I really 
don’t want you sending messages to 
Earth. I’m glad we found you in 
time.” 

“Who the hell are you?” Kevin 
demanded. 

“It’s Henri Stoire,” Ellen said. 

“Good morning,” Stoire said 
calmly. “Hal, get their tool belts, 
please.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Hal Donnelly?” Kevin said. 

“Sad but true,” the scooter pilot 



said. “Too bad you had to get 
mixed up in this, Kevin. And you 
owe me a drink, too.” Donnelly 
moved expertly, his pistol held well 
out of reach, and took their tool 
belts. 

“What are you going to do with 
us?” Ellen demanded. 

“Well, now, that is a problem,” 
Stoire said. “There is a great deal 
of money at stake here. A very 
great deal. I can hardly allow you 
to get in my way.” 

It’s happening again, Kevin 
thought. It was exactly like the time 
in the alley when the muggers had 
taken his wallet. He felt violated, 
humiliated, helpless — and Ellen, no, 
her name is Glenda he thought ir- 
relevantly, they’ll kill her. He 
tensed, ready to jump at Donnelly. 
Maybe Glenda could get away if he 
tried — 

“On the other hand, you are 
worth a great deal of money,” 
Stoire said. “What would your 
mother and father pay to have you 
back safe? Our scheme is almost 
perfect, but we all know there are 
no perfect plans. Right, Hal?” 

“I don't know, sir — ” 

“There is the sabotage group,” 
Stoire said. “True, I believe I have 
identified their agent, but suppose I 
have not? If he were to stop C-4 
from going on schedule, we would 
be left with nothing. It would do no 
great harm to have Miss Hansen- 
MacKenzie hidden away, ready to 
produce when needed. I expect 
Aeneas MacKenzie would not even 



EXILES TO GLORY 



101 




be above getting all of us off scot 
free in exchange for his daughter. It 
never hurts to have insurance.” 

“Well, yes sir,” Donnelly said. 
‘‘If you put it that way. But where 
can we keep them?” 

‘‘I believe I have an idea,” 
Stoire sai(l. He moved closer to 
Donnelly and they spoke helmet to 
helmet for a moment. 

‘‘Right. Come on, let’s go,” 
Donnelly said. ‘‘That way.” He 
pointed with his flash. ‘‘And don’t 
try anything, all right? I got nothing 
against either one of you. But I’ll 
sure as hell shoot if I have to. 
There’s just too much riding on 
this.” 

‘‘How did you — how did you 
find us?” Glenda demanded. 

Stoire’s voice was maddeningly 
calm in their headsets. ‘‘When I 
first looked at your photograph, you 
reminded me of someone,” he said. 
‘‘I could not think who, although I 
have an excellent memory for faces. 
It concerned me sufficiently that I 
made a careful study of your dos- 
sier. An intriguing document. Care- 
fully done. Really good work. But a 
few minor discrepancies. Your med- 
ical profile shows excellent physical 
condition, perfect teeth. Is that 
usual for foundlings? I do not think 
so. And the education you claim in 
your dossier does not match the 
abilities you showed aboard IVay- 
farer. A few other such things, all 
minor in themselves, but enough to 
make me think again. Where had 
I seen a blond woman who 



frightened me? And then I remem- 
bered. I met your mother many 
years ago, at least thirty years. She 
was blond then and was not so shy 
of having her photograph taken. A 
remarkably lovely woman, your 
mother. And you very much resem- 
ble the way she looked in the days 
before she married your father. ’ ’ 
‘‘Down there,” Hal said. ‘‘Take 
that trail. And go slow.” 

‘‘But how did you find us?” 
Glenda demanded. 

‘‘Ah. Once I knew who you 
were, it was obvious that I would 
have to question your, ah, lover. 
Mr. Dykes was most uncooperative, 
but he is not security minded. There 
was a copy of a map, marked, in 
his quarters. It took no great ability 
to go on from there.” 

They reached a wide ravine and 
started down into it. 

‘‘I don’t suppose you would like 
to tell me how much you have 
found out,” Stoire said. 

‘‘Go to hell,” Kevin told him. 
‘‘Be polite.” Stoire’s voice had a 
hard edge. ‘‘So far I have been as 
gentle as possible under the cir- 
cumstances. You can be made to 
talk, Senecal, and you are expenda- 
ble. I point out that we have more 
air in our tanks than you have in 
yours. We need only wait. For that 
matter, I expect you would tell us 
anything to spare the young lady the 
ordeal of our questioning — ” 

‘‘Kevin, don’t say anything!” 
Glenda shouted. 

“But you see, it doesn’t really 



102 



GALAXY 




matter what you know,” Stoire 
said. ‘‘1 have Dykes, and we have 
drugs. It will not be necessary to 
question you two, which is as well 
for you.” 

TTiey reached the bottom of the 
ravine. There was a scooter there. 
“Get on,” Hal said. He took wire 
from his tool kit and bound Kevin 
and Glenda to the scooter seats. 
“All right, sir, I can handle 
them,” the pilot said. 

“Undoubtedly,” Stoire said. 
“But — I think I will accompany 
you. Miss Hansen-MacKenzie is not 
above offering bribes — ” 

“I know better,” the pilot in- 
sisted. 

“Of course you do. Still, I think 
we will both be happier if we know 
we can trust each other — and the 
ride should be entertaining.” Stoire 
climbed onto the scooter seat. 
“Let’s go.” 



XVI 

The pilot came around and turned 
off their transmitters. He left the re- 
ceivers on. “Okay, kids,” he said. 
Hang on.” He climbed into the 
saddle and ignited the rocket motor. 
The scooter rose swiftly from 
Ceres. The pilot studied the plot in 
his navigation screen, then made 
careful course corrections. They 
moved rapidly away from Ceres, 
out into the black depths of space. 

Kevin leaned toward Glenda. 
Their helmets touched. “It looks 



like he’s taking us up to C-4,” 
Kevin said. “That doesn’t make 
sense.” 

“Kevin, we’ve got to get 
loose — ” 

“Sure. How?” He strained 
against the wire that held him. Noth- 
ing gave. “I can’t do anything. 
And Stoire’s watching — ” 

“I don’t know what to do 
either.” 

“I love you.” 

“Kevin, I’m — do you really think 
they meant it? Where could he be 
taking us? I think they’re going to 
dump us in space.” 

“They want you as a hostage,” 
Kevin said. He tried to sound more 
confident than he felt. 

And yet, he thought, it made 
sense. If there was a place Stoire 
could keep her, it could be impor- 
tant to have Glenda Hansen- 
MacKenzie on tap. MacKenzie’s 
reputation was known all over the 
world. If he made a promise — or a 
threat — he’d keep it. What might he 
do to get his daughter back? But it 
didn’t make sense to keep Kevin 
Senecal alive. 

* * * 

There was a stony rock a hundred 
meters in diameter just ahead. It 
was smaller than C-4. There were 
signs of mining on it, but no lights 
or people. It looked deserted. 

Donnelly carefully maneuvered 
the scooter toward the rock, and fi- 
nally set it down. “Well, here you 



EXILES TO GLORY 



103 




are,” he said. “Your new home.” 

“Where are we?” Kevin asked. 

“C-2,” Stoire said. “Abandoned 
three thousand hours ago. There 
was enough equipment left here to 
keep you alive. Food, oxygen, fuel 
cells. We will take your suits and 
radios — ’ ’ 

“Do you really want to do that, 
sir?” Donnelly asked. “May as 
well kill them and be done with it. 
Their radios won’t reach Ceres, and 
they will probably have to make 
outside repairs. If you want them 
alive, you’d better leave them their 
suits.” 

“All right,” Stoire said. 

“Of course, there aren’t any 
scooters here,” Donnelly said. He 
came around with a pair of wire 
cutters. He clipped the wires hold- 
ing Kevin’s left hand to the scooter, 
then pulled Kevin’s hands together 
and took a turn of wire around 
them. Then he did the same to 
Glenda before he cut them free 
from the scooter. 

“There,” he said. “I’ll leave 
your tool kits, too. You’ll get loose 
with a little work. The airlock’s 
right over there. Now, off you go. 
Go on, jump. Move. Get going.” 

They Jumped off the scooter. 

“Careful how you wiggle 
around,” Donnelly said. “You can 
jump right off this rock. Won’t do 
you any good except to kill you, of 
course, but you can do it. ’Bye.” 
He started the scooter engine. 

“Au revoir” Henri Stoire said. 
“Actually, I expect that’s a mis- 



statement. I do not think we will 
meet again.” The scooter moved 
rapidly away. 

Kevin found the wire cutters in 
his tool kit and helped Glenda free 
her hands. Then she cut him loose 
and they went to the airlock. 

“Gauges show pressure,” Glenda 
said. “I guess we really can live 
here.” 

“Sure.” Kevin cycled the lock 
and they went inside. “We can stay 
alive, but — there’s just no way 
we’re going to get off this rock! We 
could be here for years.” 

* * * 

They explored their prison. There 
wasn’t much to see. A few hundred 
meters of tunnels sprayed with plas- 
tic to hold air; some chambers 
carved out as quarters; and gear left 
when the mining operations were 
suspended. 

“There’s a lot of valuable stuff 
here,” Kevin said. “Surely some- 
one will come back for it.” 

“When Henri Stoire orders it 
done,” Glenda said bitterly. “It all 
belongs to Interplanet.” 

“Yeah.” Kevin continued to 
check the equipment available. 
“There’s mining stuff.” 

“So we mine the rocks, refine 
steel, and build a scooter,” Glenda 
said. “Somehow I don’t think that’s 
going to work.” 

“No. I guess not.” Kevin con- 
tinued to wander. A small kitchen. 

Bathroom. “Hot showers,” Kevin 
<.

said bitterly. “All the comforts. And 
they weren’t lying about food. 
Enough to keep us going for 
months. Not much variety, I’m 
afraid, tvp’s. Dehydrated stew. 
Well, we won’t starve.’’ 

They wouldn’t run out of power 
either. There were tanks of hydro- 
gen and oxygen, and a dozen fuel 
cells to produce electricity from 
them. 

There was even a thick window 
set in the outer room of the mine. It 
looked down on Ceres. The tiny 
rock was locked in rotation with 
Ceres so that it always faced the as- 
teroid below. 

“So near and so far,” Kevin 
said. “It might as well be a million 
instead of three hundred kilome- 
ters.” He watched as they moved 
over Ceres. It would be simple 
enough to jump off their moonlet 
prison, but it would do no good: 
they would still be in orbit around 
Ceres. 

Kevin took out his pocket com- 
puter. “C-2. We are 284 kilometers 
above the surface and we’re moving 
at not quite three-tenths of a kilome- 
ter a second relative to Ceres. 
That’s Just about a thousand 
kilometers an hour.” 

“Which might as well be a mil- 
lion,” Glenda said. “Damn. I have 
made a rather thorough mess of 
things, haven’t I?” 

“I’m worried about Jacob.” 

She nodded. “So am I. I haven’t 
even dared think about him. 
Do — can they make Bill Dykes tell 



them that Jacob was helping us?’ ’ 
“Given enough time, or the right 
drugs, anybody can be made to tell 
anything.” 

“And then they’ll kill Bill and 
Jacob both.” Glenda’s voice was 
bitter and full of self-accusation. 
“It’s my fault. I wanted to be cer- 
tain. I wanted to find out where 
they had hidden the arthurium. 
Catch all the conspirators. Give the 
whole package to Aeneas, all wrap- 
ped up.” 

“You tried to get a message off. 
What more could you have done?” 
Kevin demanded. 

“I don’t know. I could have tried 
to get help. I think Dr. Vaagts 
would have believed me. Or Joe 
Harwitt. Westinghouse has a lot to 
lose — ” 

“Not if they’re buying the Ar- 
thurium. And you can’t know, 
Glenda. With this much at stake, 
anybody could be involved. Any- 
body at all.” 

“I know. That’s what my father 
warned me about before I left. He 
didn’t want me to come — ” 

“I don’t blame him much.” 

“But I had to be so damned 
smart! And I’ve gotten my friends 
killed, and there’s nothing 1 can do. 
1 couldn’t even get a message off!” 
Kevin shrugged. “We did the 
best we could — ” 

“Did we? I didn’t try everything. 
I could have sent something through 
the main computer.” 

Kevin frowned. “I suppose Jacob 
could have done that. It would have 



EXILES TO GLORY 



105 




been dangerous. What we tried was 
better. A few more hours and we’d 
have done it. Or if Dykes hadn’t 
left that marked map. ...” 

“Jacob had another plan,” Ellen 
said. “He was working on the in- 
structions Stoire gave the computer. 
Jacob thinks, he can take control of 
the main computer away from 
Stoire. With just a little more work. 
Then we’d have been in control of 
the whole station.” 

“Yeah, but it has to work the 
first time,” Kevin said. “All they 
need to do is keep Norsedal away 
from the control console.” 

“They couldn’t keep me away,” 
Glenda said. “If I knew the key 
commands, I could make the com- 
puter obey me. I should have 
waited, but no, I had to do things 
my way. Damn, I’m an idiot.” 
“Don’t be so hard on yourself. 
How could you order their computer 
around?” 

“Implant. I have a transceiver 
implant, and an acceptor was put 
into the Ceres main computer when 
it was built on Earth. It was sup- 
posed to be my secret weapon, but I 
never got a chance to use it.” 

“Implant.” Kevin fell silent for a 
moment. “I’m told those cost half a 
million francs.” 

She didn’t say anything. 

“I keep forgetting. You have half 
a million francs. A lot more. 
What — how does it feel to grow up 
rich?” he asked. 

“Confined. Filled with obliga- 
tions if your father is Aeneas 



MacKenzie.” 

“Yeah, I guess it would be like 
that.” 

“I ran away from it,” Glenda 
said. “Oh, not really. But I grew 
up on the Moon, and I was the little 
princess, and it was stifling. When I 
was fifteen, I convinced myself I 
couldn’t stand it any longer. I went 
to Earth for an education.” She 
shuddered. “It was terrible at first. 
Getting used to high gravity, to 
rain, and dust and storms and cars 
and freeways — terrible and magnifi- 
cent too. Sailing. I learned to sail a 
boat. You can fly on the Moon, but 
you can’t sail. 

“So I went to school on Earth 
and I had this phoney identity, and 
1 kidded myself I was independent, 
but of course I wasn’t. I was still 
taking mother’s money. And I was 
always afraid any boys I met would 
find out who I was and then they’d 
pretend to like me because I was 
the little princess — I was a mess, 
Kevin. 

“I realized that finally, that 1 was 
worse off then ever because I was 
taking the benefits of being a 
Hansen-MacKenzie and I was 
shucking the responsibilities. So 
when 1 went back for a visit and 
heard about the Ceres operation and 
heard mother worrying about the 
small yields of Arthurium, 1 decided 
it was time to try to earn my 
keep.” 

“So it was all made up, about 
you and the foster homes, and the 
Futurians?” 



106 



GALAXY 




“Most of it. Not the Futurians. 
They’re real, and I am a junior 
member of their Fellowship. I 
thought Aeneas would be upset 
about it, but he wasn’t. He supports 
them, and they’ve helped us. 
They’re one reason you’re here, 
Kevin.” 

“How’s that?” 

“Dr. Farrington is one of the Fel- 
lowship. One of the leaders. 
After — when we were on the ship, 1 
was curious about you, so I sent for 
more information. One of the mes- 
sages I got back was from him. He 
thinks highly of you.” 

“But — why did you want to 
know more about me?” 

“Do I have to tell you?” She 
moved closer to him. “Kevin, I’m 
afraid I’ve made a thorough mess of 
everything. I don’t feel much like 
Miss Supercompetent Independence 
just now.” 

“And I’m one poor excuse for a 
hero,” Kevin said. “But I do love 
you — ” 

“And you said so before you 
knew who I was. That’s impor- 
tant,” she said. And then they didn’t 
talk at all for a long time. 

* * * 

The scooter came back thirty 
hours later. It didn’t land. Instead it 
closed to a few dozen meters from 
their moonlet and a suited figure 
leaped off. As the scooter drove 
away again, the newcomer landed 
with a suit reaction pistol and came 
to the airlock. 



“Jacob!” They let him in ea- 
gerly. “What happened?” Kevin 
demanded. 

“They caught me,” Norsedal 
sighed. “And it’s worse than that. 
They killed your friend Dykes — ” 

“Oh no.” Tears formed in Glen- 
da’s eyes. 

“And Wiley Ralston,” Norsedal 
said. 

“Wiley? How was he mixed up 
in this?” Kevin asked. 

“He was an agent for the African 
bloc,” Norsedal said. “Stoire had 
him arrested and held a trial. Ac- 
cused him of murdering you two, 
and George Lange. He was prob- 
ably guilty of killing Lange, and he 
confessed to trying to kill the two 
of you when you were leaving 
Earth—” 

“He was the saboteur on Way- 
farer?” Kevin asked. “Wiley?” 

“It looks that way,” Jacob said. 
“He was executed for it.” 

“Damn,” Kevin muttered. 
“There goes that chance. I was try- 
ing to see how Stoire intended to 
get away with it. I mean, the 
H^sen-MacKenzie heir can’t just 
vanish! Aeneas MacKenzie would 
be out here with a shipload of Han- 
sen security agents and blood in his 
eye — ” 

“And now he’s got a 
scapegoat,” Glenda said. “Dad will 
be suspicious, but — is there any 
evidence left?” 

“There is now,” Jacob said. 
“The computer still has a record of 
what happened. But Stoire will have 



EXILES TO GLORY 



107 




done something about that before 
Mr. MacKenzie arrives. He is com- 
ing, by the way. There was a report 
that Valkyrie left Luna Station seven 
hundred hours ago. I wouldn't be 
surprised if he were bringing com- 
pany police. But you’ve been re- 
ported dead and your murderer has 
been caught and executed.” 

“Looks pretty hopeless,” Kevin 
said. “Unless you brought along a 
pocket scooter.” 

“Alas, no,” Norsedal said. 
“They even took my computer.” 

“I don’t understand why you’re 
alive,” Kevin said. 

Jacob grinned slightly. “They’re 
having some problems with the 
main computer just now. If they 
ever get them fixed. I’ll be expenda- 
ble, but they thought it might be 
best to have me around just in case 
they don’t find the bugs.” 

“Will that stop them?” Glenda 
asked. 

“Alas, no. Mr. Stoire is very 
clever. He’ll figure out what I did, 
just as I finally figured out what he 
did.” 

“You know, then?” Kevin 
asked. 

“Yes. Could I have some wa- 
ter?” 

“Sure. There’s plenty. Plenty of 
everything. We could be here for 
years,” Kevin said. 

“Not me.” Norsedal’s voice 
didn’t change. “You see, they didn’t 
leave me any insulin.” 

“How — how long?” Glenda 
asked after a while. 



“If I’m careful about what I eat, 
three or four hundred hours,” Jacob 
sai^. “Perhaps longer.” 

“We’ve got to get out of here,” 
Glenda said. 

“I agree, but I confess I don’t 
know how,” Norsedal said. “I was 
telling you what Stoire did. It was 
very clever, really. First he pro- 
grammed the computer to report a 
much lower percentage of .Ar- 
thurium in the ore. Understand, the 
computer knew better, and the re- 
finery operated just the same as it 
always did, but the reported recov- 
ery was low. Then they told the 
computer to forget about one stor- 
age area, and routed ninety percent 
of the Arthurium there. Simple, 
clean, and really very pretty. And 
once Stoire erases the teal log, 
there’ll be no record of it at all.” 

* * * 

They had explored every tunnel 
in the prison a dozen times, but 
found nothing. A hundred hours 
passed. 

There was nothing they could do. 
No laser equipment to send signals 
with. No electronics. Nothing but 
some mining gear and the basic 
materials for staying alive. Even 
that took a lot of work. The algae 
in the tank farms had died, and 
their only power source was fuel 
cells. There were tanks of hydrogen 
and oxygen for those, but the car- 
bon dioxide scrubbers needed con- 
stant recharging. They had less time 



108 



GALAXY 




than Kevin had thought. 

“I would say two people have a 
thousand hours more oxygen,” 
Norsedal said. “I could — ” He 
hesitated. “I can add a couple of 
hundred hours to that, and it won’t 
really matter.” 

“I’ll be damned if you will,” 
Kevin said. “Something Will turn 
up.” 

“I doubt it,” Jacob said. “C-4 is 
scheduled to go in about nine 
hundred hours. Daedalus is putting 
in the final equipment right now.” 
“And then Stoire and Donnelly 
are gone,” Kevin said. “But how 
does he get away with it?” 

Jacob shrugged. “It would be no 
great trick to put the Arthurium 
aboard C-4. As gold, for example. 
The bombs go off, C-4 heads for 
Earth. Somewhere between here and 
there a ship — it wouldn’t have to be 
a very large one — meets them and 
when C-4 arrives in Earth orbit, the 
Arthurium is gone, with nothing left 
aboard that’s not supposed to be 
there.” 

“And it would be stupid to leave 
us alive,” Kevin said. “Once he’s 
ready to leave, he’ll come back with 
Donnelly and finish us. No evi- 
dence, no embarrassing bodies — ” 
“More likely he will take Glenda 
on C-4,” Jacob said. “Donnelly is 
part of his crew.” 

“I’m going to go have another 
look around,” Kevin said. “There’s 
got to be something we can do.” 

“I hope you think of it,” Glenda 
said. “I can’t.” 



“Alas, nor I,” Jacob added. 

* * * 

Kevin prowled through the cor- 
ridors of their prison. There has to 
be some way, he told himself. 
Ceres mocked him from below, less 
than three hundred kilometers 
down. It hung huge in the night 
sky. 

Three hundred kilometers down, 
and we’re moving about half a 
kilometer a second relative to 
Ceres, Kevin thought. That’s not 
very much velocity. Under a 
thousand miles an hour. It doesn’t 
take much energy to get to that 
speed. How much gasoline does it 
take to accelerate a car on Earth up 
to a hundred miles an hour — a gal- 
lon or so? We only need ten times 
that, not even that much. 

There’s plenty of hydrogen and 
oxygen. Marvelous rocket fuels if 
we only had a rocket. More than 
enough to get us down, except that 
the temperature of hydrogen burning 
in oxygen is a lot hotter than any- 
thing we have to contain it in — 

No. That’s not right. The fuel 
cells do it. But they do it by slow- 
ing down the reaction, and they 
can’t be turned into rocket engines. 

He remembered the early German 
Rocket Society experiments de- 
scribed by Willy Ley. The Berliners 
had blown up more rockets than 
they flew, and they were only using 
gasoline, not hydrogen. Liquid-fuel 
rockets need big hairy pumps, and 



EXILES TO GLORY 



109 





Kevin didn’t have any pumps. 

What did he have? Fuel cells, 
plenty of them, and so what? An 
electric-powered rocket was theoret- 
ically possible, but Kevin didn’t 
have the faintest idea of how to 
build one, even if there was 
enough equipment around to do it 
with. He wasn’t sure anyone had 
ever built one — certainly he 
couldn’t. 

Back to first principles, he 
thought. The only way to change 
velocity in space is with a rocket. 
What is a rocket? A machine for 
throwing mass overboard. The fas- 
ter the mass thrown away goes in 
one direction, the faster the rocket 
will go in the other, and the less 
you have to throw. All rockets are 



no more than a means of spiewing 
out mass in a narrow direction. A 
rocket could consist of a man sitting 
in a bucket and throwing rocks 
backward. 

That might get a few feet per 
second velocity change, but so 
what? There simply wasn’t enough 
power in human muscles — even if 
he did have a lot of rocks. Was 
there any other way to throw them? 
Not fast; and unless the thrown- 
away mass had a high velocity, the 
rocket wouldn’t be any use. He 
went on through the tunnels, look- 
ing at each piece of equipment he 
found, trying to think of how it 
might be used. 

You can throw anything over- 
board to make a rocket. Hydrogen, 



no 



GALAXY 




for example. That’s all Wayfarer's 
engines did, heat up hydrogen and 
let it go out through the rocket noz- 
zle. We have hydrogen under pres- 
sure — 

Not enough. Nowhere near 
enough hydrogen and nowhere near 
enough pressure, not to get velocity 
changes of hundreds of miles an 
hour. Ditto for oxygen. Gas under 
compression just can’t furnish 
enough energy. What would? 
Chemical energy; burning hydrogen 
in oxygen would do it, but it gave 
off too much; there was nothing to 
contain that reaction except the fuel 
cells and they did it by slowing the 
reaction way down and — 

And I’m back where I started, 
Kevin thought. Plenty of energy in 
the fuel cells if I could find a way 
to use it. Could I heat a gas with 
electricity? Certainly, only how — 
His eye fell on the hot- water tank 
in the crew quarters. An electric hot- 
water tank. There was a pressure 
gauge: forty pounds per square 
inch. Forty p.s.i. — He looked at the 
tank as if seeing it for the first time, 
then went running back to the 
others. 

“Glenda, Jacob, I’ve got it.’’ 
XVII 

Jacob Norsedal bent over Kevin’s 
pocket calculator. “I have worked it 
by three different methods and I get 
nearly the same answer each way,’’ 
he said. “I believe it will work.’’ 
“Sure it works.’’ Kevin grinned. 
“Steam at forty p.s.i. will come out 



fast. About a kilometer a second.’’ 
“I believe you,’’ Glenda said. 
“But it sounds silly. Steam rock- 
ets?’’ 

Kevin shrugged. “It is silly. 
There are a lot more efficient sys- 
tems. But this will work — ’’ 

“In a low g field,” Jacob said. 
“You will not have much thrust. Of 
course you won’t need much.” 

“I’m sure it works,” Kevin said. 
“Now all we have to do is build 
it.” He made himself sound confi- 
dent; he knew how much room for 
error there was in his figures. 
“Look, it takes 980 calories to turn 
a gram of water into steam. We 
heat that steam up another thirty or 
forty degrees and let it out. The 
energy is moving molecules. We 
know the molecular weight of wa- 
ter, so we can figure the number of 
molecules in a gram and — ” 

“I worked it too,” Glenda re- 
minded him. “And I get the same 
answer you do, but it doesn’t mean 
I trust it.” 

“What else can we do?” Kevin 
asked. 

“Nothing. You’re right. Let’s get 
to work ” 

* * * 

They disconnected the hot-water 
tank and drilled holes in it. Several 
turns of heating wire went through 
the holes, then they sealed them in 
with epoxy. At one end of the tank 
they drilled a large hole and 
threaded a pipe into it, threaded a 
large valve onto the pipe, and 



EXILES TO GLORY 



111 




welded a makeshift rocket nozzle 
beyond that. 

When it was done they tethered 
the tank and filled it with water, 
then connected a fuel cell to the 
heating leads. “Here goes,” Kevin 
said. He threw the switch to start 
the heaters. 

Slowly the water inside heated, 
then began to boil. The pressure 
shown on the gauge began to rise. 
In half an hour they had forty-five 
pounds of pressure. “All right, let’s 
try it,” Kevin said. 

Glenda turned the valve to let out 
steam. A jet of steam and water 
shot out across the surface of the 
moonlet. Ice crystals formed in 
space and slowly settled to the 
rocket surface. The jet reached far 
away from them, well off the moon- 
let itself. The tank pulled against its 
tether lines, stretching the rope. 

“It works!” Kevin shouted. 
“Damn it, we’re going to make it!” 
He shut off the electricity. “Let’s 
get her finished.” 

* * * 

It didn’t look like a spaceship. It 
didn’t even resemble a scooter, 
crude as those were. It looked like a 
hot-water tank with fuel cells bolted 
onto it. For controls it had vanes set 
crosswise in the exhaust stream, 
spring-loaded to center, with two 
tillers, one for each vane; a valve to 
control steam flow; and switches to 
connect the fuel cells to the heaters. 
Nothing else. 



The tank itself was fuzzy: They’d 
sprayed it with styrofoam, building 
it up in layers until they had nearly 
a foot of insulation. There were 
straps on opjxisite sides of the tank 
to hold two passengers on. 

The tank held nearly a hundred 
gallons of water. Kevin calculated 
that they had more than enough 
energy to boil it all in their two fuel 
cells, and they would only need 
sixty gallons to get to Ceres. The 
number was so small that he ran it 
four times, but it was correct. 

The strangest part was the stabil- 
ity system: a pair of wheels taken 
from a mining cart and set up in 
front of the water tank. Electric 
motors rotated the wheels in oppo- 
site directions. 

“Damndest gyros in the history 
of space research,” Kevin said 
when they got the ship completed. 
“In fact, it’s the damndest rocket 
ever.” 

“It ought to have a name,” 
Glenda said. “Something heroic, 
fitting a knight rescuing us from 
durance vile — ” 

“How about Fudgesicle?” Kevin 
suggested. 

“You’ll hurt its feelings,” 
Glenda said. 

“The Gump?” Norsedal asked 
apologetically. 

“Stop that! Galahad. That will 
do nicely, I think.” 

“You’re crazy,” Kevin said. 

Norsedal laughed. Glenda’s own 
laugh was strained. “I’m about to 
get aboard that thing, and you say 



112 



GALAXY 




I’m crazy? And you built it? Kevin, 
are we ready?” 

“I guess so. I’ve been putting off 
the awful moment, but — ” 

“Right. Come on, Jacob — ” 
Norsedal sighed. “I have been 
over the calculations. That Gump 
cannot carry three people. You will 
be lucky to get down alive with 
two. Therefore I am not coming.” 
“You have to!” Glenda insisted. 
“If you don’t get down, it does us 
no good — ” 

“Not true,” Norsedal said. “I’ve 
given you the key words. And you 
do not know where you will land. 
Now it’s true that I get around bet- 
ter in low gravity than I ever did 
on Earth, but it is also true that I 
am not athletic. I doubt that I can 
make my way over hundreds of 
kilometers of ravines — not in my 
present condition.” 

“You’re feeling the lack of insu- 
lin?” Kevin demanded. 

“Yes,” Norsedal sighed. 

“One of us should stay with 
you — ” Glenda said. She sounded 
doubtful. 

“Nonsense. You must go, be- 
cause Kevin could do nothing alone 
once he gets there. Kevin should go 
because it is more likely 1 will be 
rescued if you two get down safely, 
and two are more likely to succeed 
than one. Now, are you ready?” 

“I guess so,” Kevin said. 

“Then let’s do it before we lose 
our nerve,” Glenda said. 

“Right.” The total mass of 
Galahad with full water tank was 



just under 550 kilograms. In C-2’s 
tiny gravity it was no problem at all 
to carry it outside. 

They stood on the rocky surface 
of the moonlet to let their eyes ad- 
just to starlight. Ceres filled a full 
sixty degrees below them, a third of 
space, so close they could not even 
see all of it. It loomed huge and 
darkly forbidding, its surface lit by 
sunlight to a brightness much less 
than Earth’s moon, but it was 
enormously larger than any full 
moon. 

“We won’t have any trouble 
finding it,” Kevin said. 

“No,” Norsedal said. “But find- 
ing it is not your main problem.” 

“Don’t I know it.” 

Glenda said nothing. All three of 
them had tried to work the problem 
of a landing orbit, and they couldn’t 
do it with a pocket calculator. The 
equations for low-thrust trajectories 
were too complex, and they had too 
little data about Galahad's probable 
performance. They would simply 
have to navigate by eye and hope to 
cancel out all their velocities. 

They carried the hot-water tank to 
a low peak on the moonlet and 
pointed it so that the rocket nozzle 
was aimed as close to the direction 
they moved across Ceres’s face as 
they could manage. 

“Time,” Kevin said. 

“I’m scared — ” 

“I’m terrified,” Kevin said. 
“But what choices have we? You 
know damned well Stoire and Don- 
nelly will be back — ” 



EXILES TO GLORY 



113 




“Yes. Let’s do it.” 

It took only a gentle effort to 
push the steam rocket away from 
the moonlet, but the cartwheel- 
gyros resisted any effort to turn it. 
Finally they got it oriented properly 
in space. Then they climbed aboard. 

“Full head of steam,” Kevin 
said. “Almost fifty pounds. Ready?” 

“Ready—” 

He twisted the steam valve. At 
first both steam and water were ex- 
pelled from the tank, but as they 
began to accelerate, the water settled 
and the exhaust valve let out only 
steam. C-2 dropped away. They 
missed it. It was a prison, but a 
safe one; now they had only their 
makeshift steam rocket. 

Galahad showed a tendency to 
tumble, but with the gyros resisting, 
they were able to control it with the 
steering vanes. A plume of steam 
shot from the tank, rapidly crystalliz- 
ing into ice fog that engulfed them. 

“Damn. That’s going to make it 
hard to see,” Kevin said. “Nothing 
we can do about it.” He peered 
down toward Ceres. It didn’t seem 
any closer. Jacob’s farewell faded 
in their headsets. 

Norsedal’s calculations had shown 
that twenty minutes’ thrust should 
be enough to cancel all their orbital 
velocity. It would use up just about 
half their fuel. Once Galahad was 
stopped dead in orbit above Ceres, 
they would fall toward the asteroid, 
and they would have half their 
steam left to counteract that. 

The trouble was that Jacob 



couldn’t calculate how high above 
Ceres they would be when the 
twenty minutes were finished. As 
they lost velocity, they would lose 
altitude, and their orbit would no 
longer be a smooth circle, but an el- 
lipse intersecting Ceres — some- 
where. At the end of twenty min- 
utes Kevin cut the power off. He 
was pleased that they still had thirty 
pounds of steam pressure. 

After half an hour they were 
noticeably closer to the asteroid. It 
was time to start the steam again. 
They had to change direction of 
thrust many times, using the steer- 
ing vanes to turn the tank. It was 
easy to over-correct and they wasted 
steam in swaying back and forth 
hunting for the correct orientation. 
Mostly, though, there was nothing 
to do but wait and hope. 

As they came closer, they could 
see details on the craggy surface be- 
low. Rugged canyons, high peaks, 
deep valleys, and rocks everywhere. 
Kevin had a protractor which he 
used to measure the angle Ceres 
filled in the space below them. Then 
he used that to calculate their al- 
titude. It was crude and certainly 
not accurate to better than ten per- 
cent, but it was all they had. 

“I read a hundred degrees,” 
Kevin said. “That puts us just 
about a hundred kilometers above 
Ceres. If I’ve figured everything 
right, and if I’m reading the angles 
right—” 

“You have to be right, don’t 
you?” Glenda said. “There’s noth- 



114 



GALAXY 




ing else we can do.” 

She was right. They couldn’t get 
back to C-2 now, and they wouldn’t 
be able to find the tiny moonlet 
even if they had the reaction mass. 

‘Time for another turn,” Kevin 
said. “I think.” 

“We’re still moving — ” 

“Yes, but that’s what the 
numbers say.” 

“All right.” 

And a year ago I was working 
equations in school, Kevin thought. 
Numbers to crunch and write down 
for examinations. Now they’re 
something to stake your life on. He 
twisted the tiller slightly. The tank 
rotated, and he pointed the tiller the 
other way to stop it. It took several 
more adjustments before he thought 
he had it right. Now the steam Jet 
pointed almost directly toward 

Ceres, counteracting the asteroid’s 
pull. 

He was tempted to change the 
steam flow, but he didn’t dare. That 
was the part he couldn’t calculate at 
all. The mass of their tank changed 
constantly as steam spewed out, and 
as the mass fell, the thrust increased. 
If they turned the steam valve up 
too high, it would more than coun- 
teract Ceres’s gravity, and they 
would move away from it; and 
when they ran out of steam, they 
would fall again, this time with no 
stopping, impacting at seven or 
eight hundred miles an hour. 

“I feel like singing,” Kevin 
shouted. “I am I, Don Quixote, the 
Lord of La Mancha, my destiny 



calls and I go — ” 

“Which makes me Rosalinda, the 
scullery maid?” Glenda demanded. 

“You would rather be Sancho 
Panza? — No, that’s Jacob. And 
Galahad is our charger. Now 1 need 
a broken lance and a bent sword — ” 
“I think we’re getting closer.” 
“So do I.” Kevin took out his 
protractor and eyeballed the size of 
Ceres below. They could no longer 
see much of the asteroid; they were 
low enough that there was a definite 
horizon less than 150 kilometers to 
each side. “When we get closer, we 
have to kill our velocity relative to 
the ground. Otherwise the landing 
impact will kill us.” 

“Where will we hit ... I mean 
land?” 

“I don’t know. Fifty, seventy- 
five kilometers from the station, I 
hope. We brought plenty of spare 
air tanks.” 

For a long time they had seemed 
to be falling very slowly. Now, as 
they got closer, they seemed to be 
moving faster. Much too fast. 
Kevin couldn’t estimate their speed, 
but it was many meters per second. 
He used the tillers to turn Galahad 
directly toward Ceres, opened the 
steam valve wider. 

Not too wide, he told himself. 
Not too wide, or we’ll use up steam 
too fast and — 

The temptation to blast as hard as 
they could was almost irresistible. 
The craggy ground came up toward 
them at frightening speed. They 
were definitely coming down too 



EXILES TO GLORY 



115 




fast, and they were too close. Des- 
perately he opened the steam valve 
all the way, and switched full 
power to the heaters — 

A minute went by. Another. Now 
they were very low — and they didn’t 
seem to have much approach 
velocity, but* they were moving 
across the surface much too quickly. 
Painfully they rotated the tank until 
the exhaust pointed in the direction 
they moved over the ground, then 
tilted it again towards Ceres. Kevin 
opened the steam valve again. 

“We’ve still got pressure,’’ he 
said. “But I have no idea how much 
water is left in the tank — ’’ 

“Don’t talk about it,’’ Glenda 
said grimly. “We’re so close — ’’ 
“Sure.” Now they were less than 
a kilometer high, still moving too 
fast. Again Kevin rotated toward 
Ceres, ignoring their lateral velocity 
to kill their falling speed. “Keep a 
lookout for large objects in our 
path — ” 

“I’d say we’re moving fifty miles 
an hour,” Glenda said. 

“Enough to kill you — ” But 
slowly the rocket lost velocity to- 
ward the ground, and they were 
able to turn again. “Pick a landing 
site,” Kevin said. “Something 
under our ground track.” 

“Over there. Ahead of us.” He 
looked quickly toward the plateau 
she had selected. It was rocky but 
as good as anything else in sight. 
He rotated the rocket again; they 
were moving slantwise toward the 
ground, and Kevin kept the exhaust 



pointing straight in their direction of 
travel. 

The steam pressure was falling. 
They were running out of water, or 
else they were using steam faster 
than the fuel cells could boil the 
water; it didn’t matter. A few more 
seconds and they’d be down, one 
way or another — 

Hie plateau came up toward 
them, but not so fast now. The 
steam valve was wide open. Noth- 
ing else they could do. 

They were over the plateau and 
falling directly toward it, a hundred 
meters high and falling — 
plummeting straight down. 

“Cut loose from the straps,” 
Kevin shouted. “Be ready to jump 
clear just before we hit.” 

He worked frantically at the 
buckles, but he couldn’t unfasten 
them and keep control of the tillers. 
The rocket showed a definite ten- 
dency to tumble now as Glenda 
moved in her perch, but there 
wasn’t time for more talk, for more 
of anything — 

Fifty meters. Twenty-five. Slow- 
ing all the time. Maybe they’d 
make it after all — 

Then the ground came up and 
swatted them. They hit tail first. 
The rocket nozzle collapsed be- 
neath, and steam spewed out, form- 
ing an ice fog that condensed on the 
rocks and on his face plate. He 
worked at the buckles and got them 
loose — 

And realized he was lying on the 
surface. He couldn’t see, but he 



116 



GALAXY 




heard Glenda’s voice in his helmet. 
“Kevin! Are you all right?” 

She didn’t sound hurt. Gingerly 
he worked each limb. Nothing 
seemed broken. “We’re down,” he 
said. 

Kevin estimated their landing 
velocity at about ten miles an hour. 
The crumpled rocket nozzle had ab- 
sorbed much of the energy of the 
crash, and neither of them had been 
more than shaken up. “Any landing 
you walk away from is a good 
one,” Kevin remembered a pilot 
had once told him. “Donnelly — ” 
“What?” 

“Nothing. Something Donnelly 
told me once. When we were still 
friends. Glenda, I haven’t the faint- 
est idea of where we are.” 

“Sure you do. Why do you think 
we have visibility even though 
we’re on the night side?” She 
pointed up at the bright disc above 
them. “The station is just under the 
synchronous mirror.” 

“Yeah. I’m not thinking too 
well — ” 

“You’re doing all right.” She 
pointed to the remains of their 
steam rocket. “Splendidly, I’d say.” 
They loaded up all the full oxy- 
gen tanks and set out toward the 
satellite mirror. Kevin stopped to 
take an observation with his protrac- 
tor, then punched numbers into his 
calculator. “I make it ninety to a 
hundred kilometers,” he said. 

“Not too bad. A few hours of 
following yonder star. We’ve got 
enough air.” 



“If we don’t use it up talking.” 
Kevin started bounding across the 
surface of the asteroid. Glenda fol- 
lowed. 

They moved in long leaps. It was 
much easier than walking, almost 
like ice skating or skipping down 
hill; as long as they could keep 
going in a straight line, it took verv 
little effort. Turning or stopping 
was much harder. 

They could leap crevasses up to 
forty meters wide, and it was easy 
enough to go around bigger ones. If 
they had to climb, they could jump 
thirty meters upward, or jump down 
steep slopes. 

It was like a combination of fly- 
ing and skating, leaping across the 
surface of Ceres, and Kevin shouted 
with the sheer joy of being alive. 
They were alive, and for a while 
they were safe. 

In seven hours they were within 
sight of Ceres Station. They paused 
on a hilltop looking down on the 
leveled plain which served as the 
spaceport. 

“We could try to steal one of the 
scooters,” Kevin said. “I think we 
can trust John Eliot and the 
Daedalus people.” 

“Except that the scooters are 
guarded, and our best chance is the 
plan we already worked out. Ev- 
eryone on Ceres can’t be corrupt. 
Most of the people here believe in 
the future of the Belt — ” 

“All right,” Kevin said. “Let’s 

go” 

They went directly to the main 



EXILES TO GLORY 



117 





entrance to the station. There was 
no one in the airlock, and once in- 
side, they went into Fat Jack’s bar. 

# # « 

The bar was crowded with 
people singing and shouting. One 
by one they fell silent as they stared 
at Kevin and Glenda. 

“You’re dead,’’ Joe Harwitt said. 
“Damn it. Bill Dykes said you 
were dead! He said you’d been 
killed by Ralston!’’ 

“Did he say it to you?” Glenda 
asked. “Or to Henri Stoire and Hal 
Donnelly?” 

There was a short silence. Then 
one of the miners said, “Hell, 
Stoire and Donnelly were the only 
ones with Bill when he died. You 
saying they lied to us?” 

“Damn right,” Kevin said. 
“They’re the ones who marooned 
us on C-2.” 

“On C-2?” Joe Harwitt seemed 
to have difficulty comprehending 
that. “C-2?” 

“Yes. Jacob is still up there.” 

“He’s supposed to be dead, 
too,” one of the miners said. 
“Supposed to have had some kind 
of fight with you, Senecal. What 
the hell’s going on here?” 

“Henri Stoire is stealing In- 
terplanet blind,” Kevin said. 

“We’ll find out about that,” 
another miner said. “He’s coming 
now.” 

Stoire came in with four armed 
company police. “What is hap- 
pening — Miss MacMillan! We were 



118 



GALAXY 



told you were dead.” 

‘‘Good act, Stoire, but it won’t 
work,” Kevin said. 

‘‘Have you gone mad?” Stoire 
asked. ‘‘What are you talking 
about?’ ’ 

‘‘He claims you’ve been doing 
some embezzling,” Joe Harwitt 
said. 

‘‘And what have I been steal- 
ing?” Stoire asked. 

‘‘Arthurium,” Kevin said. 

‘‘Nonsense. All the Arthurium is 
accounted for. ‘‘Six thousand, 
seven hundred and nine grams. No 
great amount, but more than has 
ever been seen on Earth — ” 

‘‘It won’t work,” Glenda said. 
‘‘I know precisely how much Ar- 
thurium was mined. Almost four 
hundred kilograms. And I know 
where it is.” 

“Ridiculous,” Stoire said. 
“Young lady, I am trying to be pa- 
tient with you and your impetuous 
friend, but it is obvious that you 
must be restrained for your own 
good.” He turned to the others. “I 
don’t know what she wants, but I 
do not have to listen to accusations 
from a common prostitute. Lieuten- 
ant, arrest those two.” 

“Yes, sir.” The company police 
stepped forward. 

“I’m no prostitute,” Glenda said. 
“You know who I am, Mr. 
Stoire.” 

“Who?” Joe Harwitt demanded. 

“I think I’ll let someone else tell 
you,” Glenda said. She looked at 
Stoire. “Does this mean anything to 



you? Balaclava, 17 September, 
1976 .” 

Stoire suddenly looked worried. 

Glenda smiled faintly. “That’s 
the code phrase he used in his se- 
cret transactions with the company’s 
computer. Without it the computer 
won’t deliver the full records. Jacob 
Norsedal figured it out from the 
machine language. And now — ” 
She was quiet for a moment, a look 
of concentration on her face. 

“her name is GLENDA 
HANSEN-MACKENZiE,” the Overhead 
speaker said. 

“How the hell is she controlling 
your computer, Mr. Stoire?” one of 
the miners asked. 

“Implant,” Joe Harwitt said. “A 
rich young lady indeed. Only I 
never knew the computer could ac- 
cept instructions from implants.” 

“Done in Zurich,” Kevin said. 

“Where is the missing Ar- 
thurium?” Glenda said aloud. 

“I tX) NOT HAVE THAT INFORMA- 
TION.” 

Stoire looked smug. 

“How much was refined?” 
Glenda asked. 

“three hundred and ninety- 
two THOUSAND GRAMS.” 

“Four hundred kilos!” Joe Har- 
witt whistled. “Is there that much 
money in the whole solar system?” 

“Enough -that each one here can 
have one million francs,” Henri 
Stoire said. “One million for each 
of you, if you help me.” 

“Jeez, that’s a lot of money,” 
someone said. 



EXILES TO GLORY 



119 




“Where will you spend it?” 
Glenda asked. “1 have already had 
the base computer send a message 
to Hansen headquarters on Luna. 
You shouldn’t have ‘fixed’ the 
high-gain antenna, Stoire.” 

“Wait a minute.” Harwitt looked 
from Glenda to Stoire. “I don’t 
know what to make of this. You’re 
saying that you and Laurie Jo Han- 
sen’s kid — ” 

“Hell, she is,” Fat Jack said. 
The bar owner launched himself in 
a smooth curve that took him next 
to Glenda. He looked at her in- 
tently. 

“Yep. I worked for Hansen En- 
terprises, twenty, twenty-five years 
ago now. She looks like the big 
boss did back then. Same eyes. 
Yeah, I think she is.” 

“Where is the Arthurium?” she 
demanded. 

Stoire shrugged. “It appears that 
you know something 1 do not. I 
never knew there was any more.” 

“You’re a liar,” Kevin said. 

Stoire shrugged. He turned to 
Glenda. “1 really suggest that we 
go somewhere and talk quietly.” 

“Out here.” She led the way to 
the corridor. Kevin and the others 
followed. The company police 
looked to someone, anyone, for 
orders. 

Glenda and Stoire moved away 
from the crowd. Kevin was just 
close enough to hear. 

“It really is simple,” Stoire said. 
“If no excess Arthurium is ever 
found, there is no real evidence of 



any crime — ” 

“Kidnapping — ” 

He shrugged again. “Possibly. 
But the question is, do you want 
your superconductors? Because if 
any harm comes to me, you’ll never 
see that Arthurium again.” 

“It’s on C-4; we’ll find it.” 
Kevin said. 

“Of course,” Stoire said. “With 
a hydrogen bomb next to it. I doubt 
your superconductor would be much 
use after it is vaporized by a one- 
megaton bomb.” 

“You’re bluffing,” Kevin said. 

Stoire smiled thinly. “You have 
reason to know I believe in insur- 
ance. This is another form. Now — 
shall we negotiate?” 

XVIIl 

The H-bomb went off in silence. 
A bright flower of intolerable 
blue-white, dying to a dull red 
glow. 

“Just off center,” Jacob Norsedal 
said. He looked at the computer 
read-out. “They’ll Have no trouble 
correcting the slight tumble. The 
next detonation will go off on 
schedule.” 

Aeneas MacKenzie nodded. “So 
C-4 is on its way. I’m surprised you 
didn’t go with them, Jacob.” 

Norsedal laughed. “Three’s a 
crowd. Newlyweds don’t need 
company, and they can certainly 
manage the navigation.” 

“Yes. I suppose they can,” 
MacKenzie said. He glanced at the 



120 



GALAXY 




wreckage of Galahad. It hadn’t 
been easy to find, but he’d offered 
ten thousand francs to the miner 
who could locate it. Laurie Jo 
would want to see it — and so had 
he. He still couldn’t believe it had 
worked. 

“Ingenious young man, my son- 
in-law,” MacKenzie said. 

“I’ve reason to know it,” Norse- 
dal said. “What will happen to 
Stoire?” 

MacKenzie shook his head. 
“We’ll pay his debts and send him 
home. I doubt he’ll stay away from 
the gaming tables long.” 

“It seems a shame that he gets 
off so easily,” Norsedal said. 

MacKenzie’s voice was gruff. 
“Bill Dykes was a good friend. I 
don’t like it much that Stoire gets 
off, but 1 doubt Bill would have 
wanted to pay the price for ven- 
geance. It would have been high.” 

“Yes,” Norsedal said. “He had 
the entire cargo ready to blow. Ar- 
thurium, gold, all the refined 
metals — ’ ’ 

“And not even my wife could 
have put more money into space 
without some return,” MacKenzie 
finished. “Yes. Glenda made the 
only deal possible. The human race 
advances, but sometimes we pay in 
strange coin, Jacob.” 

COMING NEXT MONTH 

THE COURTS 



“Time,” Norsedal said. The 
viewscreen flared again, a point of 
brilliant white fading rapidly. Nor- 
sedal studied the radar returns. 
“Well done,” he said. He watched 
the computer read-out a moment 
longer, then looked up. “Will you 
be staying long?” 

“No. I’m taking the Arthurium 
back to Luna in Valkyrie. We can 
be back months before C-4 arrives, 
and our fusion people are anxious to 
get to work. TTiey think they may 
have a demonstration reactor by the 
time the kids arrive.” 

Norsedal typed inputs. The view- 
screen blurred, then showed a 
map of the solar system and C-4’s 
orbit from Ceres to Earth, “four 
HUNDRED AND THREE DAYS,” it an- 
nounced. 

“A long trip,” Aeneas said. 

“1 doubt they’ll notice.” Norse- 
dal’s grin was wide. 

Aeneas MacKenzie looked wist- 
fully at the viewscreen. “Laurie Jo 
and I once had sixty days to our- 
selves. Sixty days with nothing to 
do but get to know each other. I 
think you’re right, Jacob. They’ll 
find this a short trip.” 

Norsedal grinned slightly and 
typed again. 

“prognosis confirmed,” the 
computer announced. ★

Exciting Conclusion of the Amber Series 




Editorial 



IONS AND MICROWAVES 



About a week ago, as of this 
writing, I was possessed of a con- 
cept for interplanetary-range propul- 
sion at once startling in its implica- 
tions and at the same time, once 
conceived, utterly obvious. So ob- 
vious, in fact, that initially I dismis- 
sed it on the grounds that if it were 
workable some specialist at JPL 
would have already proposed 
it — and NASA would be busy im- 
plementing it. 

But six hours later (by now it 
was 5 A.M.) the idea was still itch- 
ing: try as I might 1 could see no 
reason that it would not work. So 
later that day I placed a call to Dr. 
Robert Forward, a senior scientist 
of Hughes Laboratories, so that he 
might explain to me why, ‘while 
the idea is certainly interesting, you 
understand, certain technical con- 
siderations make it totally unfeasible 
with present-day technology.’ Imag- 
ine my surprise when, after a 
short pause, he thoughtfully replied. 



“Hmmm. .that idea has been 
around for some time, but maybe 
the technology has advanced enough 
by now that it might work.” 
Whereupon he furnished me with an 
equation and asked me to call back 
when I had the idea firmed up. 

After a few calculations and con- 
siderable thought, 1 did call him 
back — several times, in fact. You 
are now reading the result. I would 
like to state quite clearly that with- 
out Bob Forward’s assistance and 
encouragement this article would 
never have been written. 

The idea is this: Since micro- 
waves can be beamed from a trans- 
mitter to a receiver and then, via 
Schottky diodes, converted to elec- 
tricity (recent tests over a 1.5 Km. 
distance achieved an efficiency of 
82% — the combination of receiver 
and diodes is called a ‘rectenna’), 
why not use microwaves to piower a 
spaceship? Admittedly electricity, 
even in unlimited amount, does not 



122 



GALAXY 




of itself constitute a space drive: 
you still need mass to throw away; 
the faster you throw it, the faster 
you go. It happens that there is a 
method, utilizing electricity [see 
“Life Among the Asteroids,” A 
Step Farther Out, Galaxy, July, 
1976], for expelling mass very 
energetically indeed. By applying 
an electric charge to a metal (the 
best metal for this purpose is now 
thought to be mercury) that metal 
can be made into charged ions mov- 
ing at velocities approaching that of 
light. In terms of reaction mass, ion 
propulsion is about sixty times bet- 
ter than the best chemical rocket 
fuel. Thus while the fuel-to-payload 
ratio (the “mass factor”) for a 
chemically propelled mission from 
earth-orbit to the asteroid belt utiliz- 
ing the most fuel-conservative orbit 
would be about a hundred to one, 
the same mission with an ion drive 
would require only as much reaction 
mass as payload (for this purpose I 
am referring to everything but reac- 
tion mass as ‘payload’). 

The problem with all previously 
proposed ionic propulsion systems 
has been that the means for provid- 
ing the electricity — generator-plus- 
fuel, solar panels, nuclear reactors, 
or whatever — have all been so mas- 
sive that net thrust is comparatively 
miniscule, measured in fractions of 
a pound per drive-unit. However, if 
we can discard the generating 
equipment from our designs, the 
situation is radically altered. That, 
of course, is exactly what beaming 



power via microwaves would ac- 
complish, replacing the generator 
and fuel for it with a receiving an- 
tenna and ancillary Schottky diodes 
for converting the microwaves to 
direct-current electricity. 

The question arises at this point 
as to the relative masses of the rec- 
tenna and whatever generating 
equipment it replaces. To speculate 
meaningfully on that we need the 
aforementioned equation [with 
which Dr. Forward was kind 
enough to furnish me]. It is a very 
simple equation that tells how small 
a spot a lens (or in this case an an- 
tenna) can make at a distance; any- 
one who has read this far will find 
it not only comprehensible but 
rather fascinating. 

What it says is that if the product 
of the diameter of the transmitter 
(d) and the receiver (D) equal twice 
the product of the distance between 
them (R) and the transmitted 
wavelength lambda) then reception 
efficiency will be almost 100%, 
since the receiver is the size of 
the spot made by the transmitter. 
Let’s plug some numbers into dD = 
2 R lambda. 

First the distance between d and 
D. Since the nearest potentially 
exploitable (as opposed to interest- 
ing) trans-lunar area in the solar 
system is the asteroid belt, 
minimum effective distance should 
be on the order of three Astronomi- 
cal Units, or approximately 4.5 
times 10® (450 million) kil- 

ometers — about 279 million miles. 



IONS AND MICROWAVES 



123 




R = 4.5 X 10* kilometers. 

Next, “lambda.” I’m told that 
the most suitable wavelength for 
this purpose is two millimeters, 
which is 2 X 10 -* (or, .000002) 
kilometers. Lambda = 2 x 10 '* 
km. 

This gives Dd = 2(4.5 x 10* 
km.) (2 X 10 -« km.) Dd = 1800 
square km. The product of the 
diameter of the receiver and the 
transmitter must equal or exceed 
1800 square kilometers; if the 
diameter of D and d are the same, 
then both must have a diameter of 
42 km. for maximum efficiency. 
The following table shows (in 
kilometers) the inversely propor- 
tional relationship between d and D 
at three AU.

Clearly if the receiving antenna is 
to be more than a kilometer or two 
in diameter, we are talking science 
fiction, some new, ultra-light-mass 
kind of antenna as yet undevised or, 
for that matter, conceived. So let’s 
look at the third line: if D is to 
equal 1.8 kilometers, then d must 
have a diameter of 1,000 kilome- 
ters. At first blush that is a very 
large transmitting area. 

Actually, a one-thousand-kilo- 



meter transmitter is perfectly feasi- 
ble. Unlike the receiving antenna, 
which must present a solid face of 
metal to the beam (any holes must 
be smaller than the wavelength), the 
transmitter need not be ‘filled’; it 
need merely consist of about 100 
unconnected transmitting elements 
that define its boundaries, the size 
of the elements themselves being 
determined solely by the engineer- 
ing requirements of the desired 
beam power. 

Certainly it would be possible to 
establish ten relatively small mi- 
crowave transmitters that would en- 
compass an area one thousand 
kilometers in diameter, or even five 
thousand kilometers, which latter 
figure gives a receiving antenna 
diameter of 360 meters. But another 
problem remains: the Earth’s rota- 
tion; since we do not want to acci- 
dentally cook, or even lightly toast, 
passing aircraft, the beams will 
have to be pointed within a few de- 
grees of vertical. Thus our transmit- 
ter would be operational for only a 
brief period each day, perhaps as 
little as one hour. Feasible, perhaps, 
but clearly undesirable as compared 
to a method enabling uninterrupted 
transmission. 

An alternative is to orbit an array 
of solar-powered satellites. This 
would have the advantage of an ex- 
tremely high value for d — so high 
that the diameter of the receiving 
antenna would be only about thirty 
meters! The objection to this 
method is the vast expanses of solar 



124 



GALAXY 




panels that would have to be lofted 
up and constructed in orbit, and the 
consequent huge expense. Although 
the cost might be in part offset by 
combining the project with a power- 
sat feasibility study, the optimal 
method would be to combine 
ground-based generators with an or- 
biting array of microwave relay 
satellites; construction of such a sys- 
tem could be begun today with little 
or no prior R&D. 

The system would be composed 
of a number of sixty-four-meter 
microwave relay stations in geosyn- 
chronous orbit, each with a ten- 
kilometer transmitting array directly 
beneath it. (It would require a 
cost-effectiveness study to deter- 
mine if it would be desirable to de- 
sign the ground transmitters to also 
beam directly to the ship antenna 
when in position to do so. While 
this would reduce the necessary 
number of both ground transmitters 
and orbital relays, it would increase 
the engineering complexity of the 
system considerably.) Using this 
method, the initial power source 
would be already extant commercial 
power plants, and the relay satellites 
would be small enough to orbit 
either by shuttle or by present 
launch facilities. 

As I intimated previously, re- 
search in this area has been held 
back by the perceived necessity for 
extremely massive electrical gen- 
erators and ancillary fuel, or 
large solar cell arrays that become 
less and less effective as they move 



away from the sun, as part of the 
propulsion system. Until such time 
as research is done that does not 
take that constraint into account, I 
am unable to speculate meaningfully 
as to precisely what the practice 
design limitations of such vehicles 
might be. Still, it is possible to 
make a few tentative deductions 
from the nature of the propulsion 
system itself. 

First, since a rectenna designed 
for high efficiency at three AU need 
be only 100 meters across when 
coupled with an orbital transmitting 
array, it would seem that the size of 
the payload would be determined 
solely by mission requirements and 
construction costs. 

Second, the system would be ex- 
tremely flexible: since the ground 
transmitters and orbital relays would 
be permanent installations, the sys- 
tem could perform any number of 
missions at little additional cost. In- 
deed, several missions could be car- 
ried out simultaneously, either by 
beaming power alternately to each 
vehicle or by designing the system 
so that it could beam in more than 
one direction at once. 

Third, in order to minimize struc- 
tural support and consequent mass 
penalty for the rectenna, we can as- 
sume low constant acceleration; the 
crews of manned missions would 
experience some slight gravity for 
the entire trip. Furthermore, since 
the mass factor is so favorable, mis- 
sions could be accomplished in a 
small fraction of what has previ- 



lONS AND MICROWAVES 



125 




ously been regarded as minimum 
trip time. It might even prove more 
efficient to use “extra” reaction 
mass to get there more quickly in 
order to reduce the mass of the 
life-support system. Perhaps man- 
ned missions will be accomplished 
in two phases:* first a “payload pack- 
age” consisting of everything but 
crew and a few weeks life-support, 
would be sent out by most mass- 
conservative orbit, then, several 
months or even years later, the mis- 
sion personnel follow, boosting out 
under high acceleration to the ren- 
dezvous point. (To take that idea a 
little further, a series of such pack- 
ages could be sent out in low- 
acceleration orbits to strategic 
planets in a Manned Tour of the 
Solar System.) 

There is another immediately ob- 
vious application of long-distance 
microwave power transmission; a 
major sticking point in the space- 
colony concept has been the design, 
transportation, and construction on 
the moon of a nuclear reactor with 
which to provide power for the 
mass-impeller (if the colonies are to 
prove economically feasible, both 
they and the power satellites that 
are their raison d'etre must be con- 
structed almost entirely of lunar 
materials — the purpose of the mass- 
impeller is to throw that material to 
the L-1 point, from which it can 
easily be transported to where it 
will be needed). A low-mass, easily 
constructed rectenna would serve 
as well or better. Indeed, this 



method could be used to power in- 
stallations anywhere in the solar 
system without the necessity for 
transporting massive generating 
equipment and fuel. 

Another, perhaps less obvious, 
application is in the nascent field 
of interstellar probes. While the es- 
tablishment of an array of relay sta- 
tions in solar orbit at one AU might 
be prohibitively costly when consid- 
ered in isolation, as part of a space 
economy based on power satellites 
and long-distance microwave power 
transmission, the expense would be 
comparatively minor. It is interest- 
ing to note that such a two-AU 
diameter array would require a re- 
ceiving antenna only 500 meters 
across for high-efficiency at a dis- 
tance of four light years. 

Of course, if the power satellite 
concept comes to fruition, in the 
long (or even fairly short) run the 
ground stations will become obso- 
lete; our ion-drive spacecraft will be 
powered not by coal, or fission, or 
felling water, but, more appropriate- 
ly, by sunlight harvested by power 
satellites that have been manufac- 
tured in space from material taken 
from the moon. 

There is, however, one use for 
which ground-based power genera- 
tion will remain essential: war satel- 
lites. 

In the last few years there has 
been a great deal of speculation 
about orbiting massive lasers and 
particle accelerators for use both as 
a defence against ballistic missiles 



126 



GALAXY 




and against other satellites. Here, as 
with space drives, the problem has 
been the power source. Since pow- 
ersats are large and visible — and 
therefore vulnerable — they are not 
suitable for use as an integral part 
of an anti-ballistic -missile system. 
For this purpose “hardened” or 
mobile ground arrays will be the 
order of the day. 

The final application of mic- 
rowave power transmittion that oc- 
curs to me (there are doubtless 
many others that have not) is in 
ground-to-orbit vehicles. For this 
purpose the rectenna would be built 
flush to the hull of the launch vehi- 
cle, and a series of small-diameter 
transmitting arrays would be placed 
down-range. The reaction mass 
could either be super-heated air or 
superheated steam. A steam-rocket 
might require somewhat more reac- 
tion mass than a chemical one, but 
water is both cheap and clean. 

CONCLUSION 

Will it really work? 1 do not 
know. I have listened to reser- 
vations ranging from the problem of 
keeping such a very wide array in 
phase to the difficulty (“impossibil- 
ity” was the word used) of attaining 
the necessary degree of tracking 
precision over such distances, to 
questions concerning almost total 
loss of efficiency due to “side 
lobes.” If my understanding is cor- 
rect, the first two problems would 
be dealt with by means of direct 
feedback loops between individual 
transmitting elements and the re- 



ceiver, while power loss would be a 
function of the square root of the 
number of transmitting elements: 
10=1/3; 100=1/10; 1,000=1/100; etc. 

Jerry Poumelle, perhaps the 
world’s foremost pessimistic op- 
timist, has taken the position that it 
might work but probably not nearly 
so well as the bare equation im- 
plies. As a “first chop” he has 
chosen to examine the implications 
of a two-kilometer rectenna. [“Jim 
Baen and His Electric Spaceship,” 
indeed! Hrrmph.] 

What 1 have proposed is not 
some sort of magical space drive, a 
la the Dean Device; the constraints 
of classical physics remain in full 
force: a spaceship still needs some- 
thing to “push against” — and it still 
must take that something along. On 
the other hand, only one sixtieth as 
much reaction mass is needed by an 
ion rocket as by a chemical one to 
perform the same mission — if the 
ion rocket does not have to carry its 
power source. 

A good historical analogy might 
be the replacement of oars by sails 
as the primary power-source for 
water craft. Just as muscle-powered 
vessels were by their nature 
restricted to brief, coast-hugging 
dashes, so chemically powered 
rockets are simply not good enough 
for large-scale missions of trans- 
lunar scope. Just as sailing ships 
conquered the seas, so too will ion 
rockets conquer the solar system, 
and in so doing, open an era of 
material plenty here on earth. ★

ItIy friends, you will have to be 
indulgent this month. I will do my 
best to make this column both enter- 
taining and informative, but 1 will 
admit in advance that I’m going to 
have to knock it out fast. 

Why? Because this has been A 
Month. A rather good one for me, 
but very tightly packed. To begin 
with. I’ve had a lot of administra- 
tive and business work. Lucifer’s 
Hammer, the latest by Niven and 
Poumelle (Playboy Press, $10.00, 
and you'd better rush out for a first 
edition: they may not last — Ed.), had 
to be finished off. There was the 
auction of paperback rights (which 
went very well, but if you’re wait- 
ing for a paperback, you may have a 
long wait); the sale of visual-arts 
rights; last-minute work on the gal- 
leys (very clean, since our publisher 
hired Jim Baen to “vet” the work 



of the in-house proofreaders, and a 
marvelous job he did, too, only 
Larry and I decided to insert two 
scenes and rewrite one in galley); 
telephone conferences; celebrations 
(the paperback and visual-arts sales 
went very well); and myriads of 
other details. 

Mail. 1 appreciate mail, and I try 
to answer letters, but I can’t do 
them all. I manage some kind of 
reply to those who enclose a self- 
addressed stamped envelope, and 
try to gel off postcards to most 
others, but sometimes the unan- 
swered letters reach archeological 
layers on my desk and the good 
fairies come in and remove them. I 
truly apologize to those who’ve 
written and received no reply; the 
list includes friends who have every 
right to expect an answer. 

And now, as I’m trying to do my 



128 



GALAXY 



column, comes word that I’m ap- 
pointed Associate Field Director (a 
courtesy title) of the Metropolitan 
Museum of Fine Arts, and must 
outfit a survey expedition to 
Guatemala for next week in com- 
pany with Field Director Russell 
Seitz. The work is non-trivial. 
There is, it turns out, a technique 
for neutron activation which will 
allow one to determine from pre- 
cisely which mine various precious 
and semi-precious stones were ex- 
cavated. Applied to a number of 
Olmec pre -Colombian artifacts, the 
technique should tell us much about 
the migrations and trade patterns of 
those mysterious people; it remains 
to collect samples of serpentine and 
jadite from various locations, which 
requires the survey expedition this 
month (and probably another later.) 

But that requires me to recover 
from my shots (about half the dread 
diseases afflicting mankind are now 
trying to establish themselves in my 
system; “Grab that germ and hold it 
tight! Leukocytes, antibodies, fight, 
fight, fight!’’) and to buy enough 
gear to turn my perfectly adequate- 
for-the-High-Sierra backpacking out- 
fit into something that will let me 
survive in a tropical rain forest. 

Add to that the requirement for 
me to attend a convention two days 
after returning from Guatemala, and 
the probable grand tour to promote 
Lucifer’s Hammer next month, and 
you will .see that I’ve had a busy 
month and have another ahead of 
me. Finally, Jim Baen has called 



several times to talk about the new 
space-exploitation system he’s 
dreamed up, and wants a systems 
analysis of same, and here I am 
composing on the stick. Thus I truly 
beg indulgence. 

* * ♦ 

A year or so ago 1 described 
ion-drive ships adequate for exploi- 
tation of the asteroid belt. They 
were very large; they had to be be- 
cause they required megawatts of 
electric power. At the time 1 wrote 
that, I was perfectly aware that one 
could send electric power by mic- 
rowave, and had described such sys- 
tems in other columns. What I didn’t 
do was combine the ideas: Why 
not an ion-drive ship which receives 
its power from a fixed source? 

Alas, 1 never did put the ideas 
together; then, on a Sunday morn- 
ing just after we had returned from 
church, came a frantic call from Jim 
Baen, who had done just that, and 
wanted to know if it would work, 
and whether it had been dreamed up 
before. 

1 didn’t recall any previous men- 
tion, and my immediate reaction 
was, “It’s so obvious, somebody 
must have thought of it and decided 
it wouldn’t work’’, a common form 
of the “Not Invented Here” syn- 
drome that plagues government, in- 
dustry, research labs, universities, 
and damned near everything else. 

Second thought was, “Why the 
hell not?” 



JIM BAEN AND HIS ELECTRIC SPACESHIPS 



129 




Third thought is this column. Un- 
fortunately 1 lack some critical 
numbers, and so does everyone else 
I’ve checked with; the most impor- 
tant one missing is the mass of the 
receiving antenna to absorb the 
power densities required. “They’re 
not heavy” is the best 1 can get 
from engineers who’ve worked on 
such systems; but they’re thinking 
in terms of systems designed for 
emplacement on planets, particu- 
larly this one. But since we’ve only 
to design for rather low thrusts 
(you’ll see why in a bit) and any- 
thing that will stand up to gravity 
and wind on Earth is certainly 
strong enough to withstand low 
thrusts in space, “They’re not very 
heavy” may be information enough. 
Surely the receiving antenna cannot 
be massive compared to an on- 
board fusion generator. 

Let’s look at some missions. 
First, supplying the men and 
equipment to build a Moon Base. 
We’ll suppose ships that deliver 
100, (XX) kilos of payload, and fur- 
ther assume parasitic mass of an 
additional 20%, giving us 120, (X)0 
kilos of ship and payload; to that 
we must add fuel and the antenna. 
Certainly, though, 100 metric ton- 
nes at a shot is worth delivering; 
and since our ships will work 
equally well coming back as going 
up, we’ll have opened up commerce 
with the Moon. It can lead to 
mines, construction of ships for 
exploitation of deep space, a host of 
activities — all worth thinking about. 



Now the real advantage of ion 
rockets is that they give a truly 
humungous exhaust velocity, with a 
specific impulse of up to 20,000 
seconds — compare that to the best 
chemical rockets which have 
perhaps 400, and the hydrogen-fuel 
fission engine NERVA which hoped 
for 1200, and you get the idea im- 
mediately. (For the basic equations 
for all this, see the column for April 
1977, where I spell it all out.) 

Cranking in conservative esti- 
mates for getting from Earth to 
Moon, and assuming we manage 
only specific impulse of half the 
theoretical value obtainable from 
ion rockets, we get a mass ratio of 
only — 1.13, and that’s something to 
get excited about. It means that the 
all-up mass of the ship with fuel is 
only 136,000 kilos — except that 
we’ve neglected the antenna. 

Well, Jim gives the basic equa- 
tion in his article elsewhere in this 
issue. Let’s assume we construct 
here on Earth an antenna 5 kilomet- 
ers in diameter, certainly not a dif- 
ficult proposition; to get to the 
Moon we need only 300 meter an- 
tennae on our ships. That’s a bit 
more than 70 million square cen- 
timeters of area; make it a centime- 
ter thick, of solid copper (it must 
carry a large current density), and 
we come up with something more 
than six billion grams of antenna 
weight. That may be a bit much. 
Well, cut it to a half cm. thick (5 
mm shouldn’t be excessive for the 
currents we must carry) and assume 



130 



GALAXY 




that only 10% of the area will be 
filled with copper wire and insula- 
tion. That gives us 31 million 
grams, or 317,000 kilos. Add to it 
the original mass of the ship and 
we’re up to 437,000 kilos; multiply 
by our mass ratio of 1.13, and the 
all-up mass is 493,440 kilos, which 
seems a lot — 

Except that it’s not. We’re well 
under the mass of Saturn rockets — 
and we’re putting a full quarter of 
that onto the Moon. More than that, 
the ship is re-usable. We’ve estab- 
lished that we’re in a reasonable re- 
gime. Now let’s refine. 

The receiving antenna looks like 
a mess of bedsprings with diodes at- 
tached. The current densities are not 
really so large as indicated. On the 
other hand, we’ve totally neglected 
the mass of the engines to drive 
this. There are tradeoffs here: If we 
feed all this power into one big en- 
gine, the engine mass is negligible 
compared to the antenna mass; but 
the antenna mass goes up because 
of the power requirements. Let’s 
redesign the ship to put a small ion 
engine at each 100 square meters, 
sticking them all over the antenna. 
That way no part of the antenna 
handles much current. 

We now have 150 meter radius, 
70,686 square meters, or 707 
patches 100 meters square. Dr. 
Forward tells me the current Hughes 
ion engines mass about 17 p>ounds, 
roughly 7.7 kilos. All those engines 
together (neglecting piping, pumps, 
and other stuff) run us up to another 



5.5 metric tons; now for the antenna 
itself. We’ll assume one-millimeter 
copper wire covering 5% of the an- 
tenna area (and assume the diodes 
and electronics are included in that). 
Adding the nearly 32 metric tonnes 
of antenna to the engine mass, we 
get a grand total of 37,129 kilos for 
our power plant. Add to that the 
ship mass and we have 157,000 
kilograms before we add fuel. 

But now that we’re working in 
the real world we find, alas, that 
Hughes has obtained at best a 
specific impulse of 1000. If we 
want to work on that to get it up to 
the 10,000 we assumed before, we 
may well add mass. Let’s com- 
promise and keep the ship mass fi- 
gures, but recalculate the mass ra- 
tio using 5,000 for specific im- 
pulse. It still brings us to a mass 
ratio of only 1.5, so the all-up mass 
of ship and fuel is 236,000 kilos, 
about half what we figured in the 
first cut. Not bad. 

Now what about power require- 
ments? I’ve assumed a velocity 
change of roughly 20 kilometers a 
second; that is. I’ve assumed that 
the ion engines will carry the rocket 
from Earth surface to Lunar surface. 
That’s likely to be excessive. It 
comes from having all that high-ef- 
ficiency fuel system to play with. 
This thing very probably won’t lift 
itself off the Earth, and so what? 
NERVA would never have lifted off 
from Earth, but it would be a per- 
fectly adequate system for orbit-to- 
orbit missions, and this is a good 



JIM BAEN AND HIS ELECTRIC SPACESHIPS 



131 




deal more efficient than NERVA. 
(Or is it? We’ll come to that in a 
minute.) 

Obviously we must have some- 
thing in excess of 1 g to lift from 
Earth. In fact, we need nothing 
more than l.J g to do the job, but 
let’s assume 1.5 since anything 
going up more slowly has stability 
problems. There’s a need to get the 
thing up high enough to let us beam 
power to it. We’ll assume the 
world’s longest extension cord for 
the first leg, until we’ve got that 
high. 

To find the power needed, we 
need a number — how much thrust 
can you get for a kiloWatt? The old 
SPACE HANDBOOK says 2100 
kW to get one pound. Bob Forward 
says Hughes Labs have achieved a 
pound thrust with 100 Kw, a much 
better figure. A pound of thrust will 
accelerate 1 pound of weight at 32 
feet/second, and weight is a force, 
and one is supposed to convert to 
slugs, and that is the point where 
even after all these years I get con- 
fused. If we’re lifting from Earth, 
though, we need not worry; We 
have 236,000 kilograms, which 
works out to 520,000 pounds of 
weight; it takes 100 kW to lift each 
pound, or 52 million kiloWatts just 
to hold it up. To get our ship actu- 
ally to rise at 1.5 g, we’ll need 78 
million kiloWatts, and clearly we’re 
not going to do it. 

Our antenna just won’t handle 
power densities of that order. 
Worse, it’s just a lot of power, 52 



thousand to 78 thousand mega- 
Watts, and the biggest power plants 
we know of put out on the order of 
one or two thousand megaWatts. 
Most of the existing plants won’t do 
anything like that. 

Scratch the Earth-to-Moon shot 
powered by beam. It won’t help a 
lot to reduce ship mass, either, be- 
cause you will recall that much of 
that mass was the receiving antenna 
and ion engines, and the antenna 
size is fixed by the distances over 
which we must send the power. 

Well, what about Earth orbit to 
the Moon, not attempting to lift 
ourselves out of a planet’s gravity 
well? First, we aren’t going to at- 
tempt to land on the Moon; even a 
sixth of that power density is still 
far too great. Is it worth building 
this system for Earth orbit to Lunar 
orbit? 

Well, let’s see. We can accept 
thrusts of .01 gravity, bringing our 
power requirements down to less 
than a thousand megaWatts, well 
within present capabilities (but that 
transmitting antenna is going to be 
big, hairy, and expensive). But how 
shall we land? 

Well, we can get to orbit in 
chunks, chemical rockets, shuttles, 
nuclear ramjet first stages, laser sys- 
tems, whatever; orbit-to-orbit with 
the beam-power ion rocket; and 
land at the other end with chemical 
shuttles. For comparison let’s look 
at a NERVA system as the orbit- 
to-orbit craft. NERVA, you may 
recall, is a nuclear-fission pile

through which one squirts hydro- 
gen. Before the project was can- 
celed, it achieved specific impulses 
of 600; it was designed for 800; and 
they hoped for 1200. Use the 800 
figure on the ship we designed for 
this space mission; apply to our 12- 
0,000 kg. ship; we get a mass ratio 
of about 1 .6, so the all-up mass of 
ship and fuel is 192 tonnes. 

But of course we can’t compare 
that to a ship designed to go Earth 
surface to Lunar surface, so we take 
our 120,000 kg ship, add the an- 
tenna, and get 157 tonnes; recalcu- 
late the mass ratio required for 
orbit-to-orbit operations (1.04), and 
discover that the all-up mass is 169 
tonnes. Even with the parasitic mass 
of that antenna, we start with a 
lighter vehicle, meaning less gunk 
to get into orbit — and Baen’s 
electric-powered spaceship is reusa- 
ble, meaning we don’t have to lift 
so much reaction mass into Earth 
orbit every time we want to send a 
cargo to the Moon. 

I can’t off-hand calculate the 
number of missions to breakeven, 
but let’s look. Assume we get $20 
per pound as cost to lift to orbit. 
We save 23,000 kilos per trip, 50,- 
000 pounds, or a cool million 
bucks per mission. The installed 
cost per kW of a nuclear plant is in 
the order of $1,000. Assume we 
build a power plant to be used for 
Lunar missions (and thus assume 
that in off-hours we sell power to 
help defray costs of research and 
development of the ion ships, an- 
tennae, and the like), and we’ve a 
total cost of something like 
$800,000,0(X); trivial, in terms of 
Apollo or the Welfare budget, or 



the Interstate Highway project; and 
one assumes that the profits from 
sales of power will not be imagi- 
nary, since (neglecting legal and 
licensing fees, which drive the costs 
of power plants up to double and 
treble the actual costs) pKJwer plants 
are built at such costs in the expec- 
tation of making money. 

Then there’s another angle; We 
might want to build a power plant 
and transmitting antenna on the 
Moon. If we do that, we need not 
design ships to accept power over 
such long distances; at .01 g we 
need accelerate less than 8 hours to 
inject into proper orbit to reach the 
Moon, and we’ll have travelled 
something less than 50,000 kilomet- 
ers, making our antenna considera- 
bly smaller and lighter. At the other 



JIM BAEN AND HIS ELECTRIC SPACESHIPS 



133 




end the Lunar station provides the 
power to make orbit, after which 
Lunar shuttles come up to meet the 
ship — and since they need not have 
a payload of 100 tonnes, they might 
very well be powered by the Lunar 
transmitting antenna. 

Fascinating. And immediately 
come other ideas. Using materials 
mined on the Moon and the Lunar 
transmitter, we could build cities in 
space (perhaps not at the L-5 point, 
which may not be optimal after all, 
but no matter; there are plenty of 
orbits). 

Conclusion; Baen’s electric- 
powered spaceships must be consid- 
ered as contenders for exploitation 
of Lunar resources. They may not 
be the best thing available, but they 
cannot be ignored in cost compari- 
sons. 

* * * 

Now what of deep space? There 
are problems. A 1.8 kilometer 
antenna/engine complex similar to 
that described for the Lunar orbit- 
to-orbit mission masses over a mil- 
lion kilograms, but I worry about 
power densities with very large an- 
tennae, and the problem of receiv- 
ing power at an acute angle to 
thrust — that is, when you reach, 
say, Ceres, you must accelerate 
along a path more or less at right 
angles to a vector leading to Earth, 
and that could present problems, 
esp>ecially if your engines are 
mounted in various places on the 



antenna. 

Then too there is the simple fact 
that such ships are truly dependent 
on the stations beaming power (boy, 
are there conflict stories in that 
thought!) and on scheduling and 
solar-system geometries; that ne- 
gates the independence 1 postulated 
for the Belt civilization ships in my 
story. Tinker. 

Then, too, do we need such large 
antennae? If everything works p»er- 
fectly, perhaps not — but since in the 
real world that is seldom the case, 
let’s assume we do. On the other 
hand, can we not work the problem 
as we did for the established Lunar 
base, with power stations on Mars, 
Ceres, the other asteroids we want 
to exploit? Earth then becomes just 
one more place in the solar system. 
To get from Ceres to Mars, you ac- 
cept power from Ceres until you’ve 
reached the proper velocity, coast, 
and when approaching Mars, arrange 
to get power beamed up. Sure, 
you’re dependent on someone at the 
arrival point, but then 747’s are de- 
pendent on airports, and B-52’s are 
dep)endent on in-flight refueling. 

Given that concept, the numbers 
aren’t a lot different from the 
Earth-Moon run. Remember the 
first of these columns? When you 
get into Earth (or Mars or any 
other) orbit, when you’re indepen- 
dent of planetary gravity wells 
(called “holes” in Niven’s 
‘known-space’ series), you’re half- 
way to anywhere; the velocity 
changes required to get to the sur-

face of the Moon are not wildly dif- 
ferent from those needed to get 
from Mars to the asteroid belt. Of 
course the coasting times are much 
greater. 

But to return to the ship with the 
1 .8 kilometer antenna; The antenna 
itself, with ion engines attached, 
masses 1,329,022 kilograms, or 
1329 tonnes. Add ship mass of 
another 50,000 tonnes, and multi- 
ply by the mass ratio, and we’ve 
got an all-up fueled weight in the 
order of 58,000 tonnes — and that’s 
quite comparable to the masses I as- 
sumed for the larger ships in 
Tinker. In fact, as I recall the arriv- 
al payload mass of Agamemnon 
was precisely 58,000 tonnes. Once 
again the concept is not silly; it may 
well be competitive with on-board 
fusion devices. 

Of course we don’t know what 
on-board fusion systems will mass. 

BULLETIN. I paused to open my 
mail, and Lo!, Gerald Yonas of 
Sandia Corporation announces that 
the US has achieved fusion neutrons 
from electron-beam inertial con- 
finement fusion experiments. An- 
other milestone along the devel- 
opment of fusion research — or, 
given Carter’s budget cuts, a 
tombstone? An achievement of 
some importance, anyway. 

What we’ve shown in the above 
is that there may very well be a 
place for Jim’s electric-powered 
spacecraft in our future, provided 
that we can get to a future that in- 
cludes space operations, or large

electric power systems, or indeed 
much of anything besides out-door 
privies and insulated attics. Obvi- 
ously a nation or corporation or 
world that builds such massive 
power plants and transmission sys- 
tems is committed to exploitation of 
space; You don’t put together any- 
thing that expensive just to go dig 
up a few rocks and bring them 
home. 

As to whether the system would 
be the proper way to explore Mars 
and the asteroid belt — as opposed to 
the best method for routine travel 
between them once they are 
explored and transmitters and power 
plants are built at various 
locations — 1 doubt that anyone has 
enough data to do a definitive 
analysis. Certainly I don’t; but any 
time you have a shot at a system 
that will give you specific impulses 
in the thousands, you can’t possibly 
ignore it. In Tinker I solved the 
problem with on-board fusion power 
plants; Jim has come up with 
another contender. 

1 don’t really care which of these 
is used, or whether either is. There 
is also the boron fission-fusion .sys- 
tem mentioned in past columns. 
There’s ORION, old bang-bang, 
which can put a couple of million 
pounds onto the Moon in one 
whack. There are other candidates. 

What I do care is that we head 
that way, forget this “Only One 
Earth” nonsense, and realize that 
we live in a system of nine planets, 
35 moons, a million asteroids; that 



we insure that no single act of a 
madman, no single accident, no 
single disaster, can wipe us all out; 
and the sooner we get to that, the 
better. 

1 see that I’ve lapsed into random 
thoughts. My problem is that 1 am 
all too aware of what I must do to- 
morrow; get down to the consulate 
for a visa, get better jungle boots, 
procure maps, buy out the local 
supplier of Cutter’s Laboratory in- 
sect repellent, get silica gel for the 
cameras, call again about rental of a 
four-wheel drive vehicle; a myriad 
of details to be accomplished in a 
short time. I’d best get at it. When 
I have some harder numbers to play 
with. I’ll take another cut at Jim 
Baen’s Electric Spaceships and let 
you know. Meanwhile, whether this 
system is best or another is, it looks 
feasible — and that’s one more proof 
that we don’t have to huddle to- 
gether on Earth and wait until we 
run out of resources. 

We can get out there. We’ve only 
to decide that we should. ★

Marcia Martin & Eric Vinicoff 




A Story of Planned 
Parenthood — but not the kind 
you think 



the beginning 

A SHORT RESPiTK. Barbara lay on 
her back, legs in stirrups, covered 
with a blue drape. She looked 
around at the delivery room that had 
become her world: sterile, efficient, 
gleaming white plastic and chrome, 
completely at odds with the animal 
urge that drove her. Masked and 
gowned figures milled about. Even 
Neil beside her seemed unfamiliar. 

“Okay, here we go again.” The 
doctor intruded on her brief peace. 
“Push!” Neil and a nurse raised her 
back off the table as she took a 
deep breath. She pushed down as 
hard as she could, the blood pound- 
ing in her head, hands white from 
her grip on the handles. 

Another breath. She dimly heard 
the doctor’s, “Good, keep it up!” 
as the urge swept her on. Immense 
pressure shook her. She felt she was 
about to burst. But she kept going, 
driven to bring forth the life within 
her. 

A third breath. Neil pressed her 
shoulders, and she managed to draw 
even more strength from some- 
where, bearing down, down into a 
red haze. 

138 



“Barbara, stop pushing! Now 
pant! Pant! Here comes the head.” 
The doctor worked swiftly and deft- 
ly, her fingers guiding the baby’s 
head through to the world. 

Barbara sank back gasping as the 
contractions ebbed. She felt like a 
sack of meal. Nine months of wait- 
ing were almost over. In a few 
minutes she would be a mother! 

“Neil?” She reached out for 
him, and he held her hand. 

“You’re doing great. Barb.” 
Neil’s voice was exultant. “We’re 
almost there.” 

“Once more, Barbara. A little 
push now.” The doctor was block- 
ing Barbara’s view of the mirror in 
which she was supposed to be able 
to watch the birth. But she didn’t 
care. 

A last surge of power wracked 
her as she pushed down. She 
grunted. Then she felt the baby — 
like a slithering fish — slip down and 
out of her. Relief washed through 
her, and she started to cry. 

“It’s a boy!” Neil’s voice broke. 
“Oh, Barb, love, you did fine!” He 
kissed her awkwardly through his 
mask, his forehead as red and sweat- 
y as hers. 

“Congratulations, both of you. 
Your baby is perfect — Apgar 

Ten — that’s the best rating we 
give.” The doctor was beaming at 
them. 

She stepped around to join them, 
and Barbara saw Jason at last. He 
was small, pink and beautiful. He 
stopped crying as he was handed to 

GALAXY 




Barbara. She cuddled him, free fi- 
nally of the nameless terrors of de- 
formity that had haunted her preg- 
nancy. Handing him over to his 
proud father, she abruptly fell a- 
sleep. 

* * * 

“They’ve sprung it — damn 
them.” 

The Oval Office trembled with si- 
lence. The man seated across the 
desk from the President nodded. He 
was an ancient Texican with erect 
military posture. He had no official 
position in the government, but his 
authority was as real as it was per- 
vasive. “I listen to the news too, 
Don. CIA was a month off. Which 
hardly matters now, of course. The 
question is — ” 

“1 know what the question is.” 
President Nivling leaned back in his 
chair, looking smaller, older and 
more tired than he did on TV. Be- 
hind him a pair of faded movie 
posters vied with the somber dignity 
of the room. He was frowning. 
“Let’s take it short-term first.” 

“So?” 

“First our stance. We downplay 
the whole Third World Resource 
Alliance concept. Too many chiefs. 
Someone will break the embargo, 
and it’ll all fall apart.” 

“You buying any of that your- 
self?” 

“Wish I did. They’ve got us by 
the balls.” The President shix)k his 
head. “Dammit, we’ve seen this 

AND BABY AAAKES THREE 



coming for years. And didn’t do 
jack shit!” 

“Congress wouldn’t bite the 
bullet — never could see needs fur- 
ther down the road than the next 
election. And it isn’t Just us. The 
whole industrial world walked into 
this one.” 

“Maybe we thought we could 
trade technology for resources 
forever. But we’re sure as hell 
being kissed off how.” 

“The Third World can do with- 
out?” 

“Why not? We’ve built them up, 
given them enough base so they can 
pool for further development. 
They’ve finally caught on to the 
fact that there aren’t enough re- 
sources for everyone. So guess who 
gets frozen out?” 

“They’re right,” the man facing 
the President said coldly. “They 
just want to survive like the rest of 
us.” 

“Tell that to the people when the 
lights go out. How are we fixed for 
native resources?” 

The man consulted a clipboard on 
his lap. “Summation: We have 
some of what we need, but not 
enough.” 

“Does Defense see a military op- 
tion?” 

“Sure. Thanks to proliferation of 
A-tech and limited-delivery sys- 
tems, we can opt for the Last 
War.” 

“Thought as much,” the Presi- 
dent grunted. “I’ve been on the line 
to some of our more hot-headed al- 



139 




lies all afternoon pointedly suggest- 
ing just that.” 

“Europe, eh. 1 don’t see much of 
a future for them — no resources 
left.” 

“Too true. Fortunately the 
Soviets and (^hinese weren’t import- 
ing much. I think we can keep the 
international lid on. That leaves the 
folks we work for.” 

The man nodded. “We need a 
statement for immediate release. 
That should do until we get our an- 
swers down.” 

“Tell me something. Why did 1 
ever get out of showbiz?” 

“To save the country, of course. 
Start saving. We’ve got to crack 
this embargo fast.” 

The President turned and looked 
at the posters. “Or survive it.”

year four 

It was named Freedom Park of 
San Francisco. 

Optimistically but, as it turned 
out, in bitter irony. It had been built 
by low bidders who used sub- 
standard materials and bribed in- 
spectors. Then twenty years of un- 
caring tenants and shoddy upkeep 
had finished the job. 

Neil trudged across the summer- 
brown ground between the un- 
finished concrete monoliths. In his 
exhaustion he was prone to rem- 
inisce. He recalled the tanker-rout- 
ing career he had had at Standard 
Oil before the embargo. Even more 



painfully, he recalled the modest 
home on Mount Davidson they had 
owned — before. 

They might have owned it still, 
but for the bills from having Jason. 
Hospital bills. Doctor bills. Food 
and clothing bills. Insurance bills. 
And on and on and on. 

They might have been living 
there still. Instead they were here. 

He climbed the stairs to the fifth 
floor and pounded on their apart- 
ment door. He identified himself, 
heard the locks unbolt, then went 
in. 

Barbara kissed him, and he kiss- 
ed back. Part of his bleakness 
lifted. “Everything okay?” 

“Uh huh.” She stood rigidly by 
the door. She had to almost shout to 
be heard — Jason was chasing a rub- 
ber ball around the small living 
room, shrilling his exuberance. 

“No trouble?” 

“If there was. I’d have said!” 

A pause, then; “How’d the shop- 
ping go?” 

“I wasn’t hassled — not that there 
was much to rip off. Christ, you 
stink. Worse than usual.” 

“Tell me about it.” He stripped 
and tossed his clothes into the 
hamper near the door. Then he col- 
lapsed on the ratty sofa. The week- 
daily hike to and from the dump 
was rough on a man coming from 
soft executive life. He looked for- 
ward to the day their savings would 
buy a new chain for the bike. “1 did 
pretty well today,” he sighed. “Six 
dollars in bonus credit. I found

some aluminum cans." 

‘‘They let you work the old 
piles?” 

He nodded. 

‘‘That’s — Jason, stop!” She 

rushed over and pulled him away 
from the lamp cord he was yanking 
on. 

Nothing came free anymore, not 
even welfare. All able-bodied recip- 
ients had to work thirty hours a 
week at the nearest garbage-salvag- 
ing operation to get their benefits. 
Metals, plastics, wood and so 
on — all were recovered and sent to 
their resptective industries for reuse. 
The remaining organic waste went 
to farms as fertilizer. 

Barbara settled into his lap, and 
held Jason in hers. He groaned, but 
didn’t complain. Jason was bur- 
bling, ‘‘Daddy home,” again and 
again. 

Neil tousled his light brown hair. 
‘‘You have a good day?” 

Jason nodded enthusiastically. 

Something tore at Neil as he 
looked around the crowded living 
room that doubled as Jason’s bed- 
room. Through an open door he 
could see the even smaller bed- 
room. It was a dump; windows 
cracked, infested with roaches, 
paper peeling, rugs rotting. Half the 
electrical equipment and plumbing 
didn’t work, and couldn’t be re- 
paired for lack of parts (or 
money — the rich still managed to 
get by). How long could Jason’s in- 
nocent pleasure in life survive such 
surroundings? 



‘‘Cheer up, pouty,” Barbara 
said. ‘‘It’s Friday — you’ve got the 
whole weekend to recover.” 

‘‘Thank God for small — ouch, 
stop kicking, Jason — favors.” But 
he smiled, and ran a hand down 
Barbara’s back. Fortunately there 
were some pleasures beyond 
economics. 

They left Jason to amuse himself 
with his ball, and adjourned to the 
bedroom. 

In bed they could renew each 
other with pleasure and love reaf- 
firmed. They found their primal 
focus, tuning out adversity and all 
else, even Jason. For a timeless 
time they rode the joy-save higher 
and higher, nearing the peak — 

‘‘Mommy! I’m thirsty!” 

With almost explosive intensity 
Barbara threw herself off of Neil 
and whirled. Jason was standing at 
the foot of the bed. ‘‘I told you 
never to come in here when the 
door’s shut without knocking!” she 
shouted. 

Jason stumbled back into the liv- 
ing room, sheet-white, stunned. 

Barbara collapsed next to Neil, 
sobbing and whispering, “I’m 
sorry,” over and over. 

Neil pulled her close. “What’s 
the matter. Barb? Why did you 
blow like that?’ ’ 

She turned a tear-damp face to 
him. “I . .don’t know. Something 
just ... cut loose.” 

“Huh?” 

Her crying gradually stopped, and 
she forced a wan smile. “It’s been 



AND BABY AUKES THREE 



141 




a bad day. I’m okay now.” 

‘‘You sure?” 

She nodded, then rose and slip- 
ped back into her dress. 

‘‘Where are you going?” 

‘‘To apologize to Jason. And try 
to explain. I must have hurt him a 
lot.” Then her real smile returned. 
‘‘Don’t you dare move a muscle. 
I’ll be right back.” 

Neil blew her a kiss. ‘‘You do 
that.” 

* ★ * 

The meeting room was the largest 
on Capitol Hill, but it was filled to 
overflowing with spectators and 
clotted with media paraphernalia. 
Facing all of this, elevated and spot- 
lit, the members of the Senate Ad 
Hoc Committee on Resources nerv- 
ously tried to go about their busi- 
ness. 

Senator Barrett was preparing his 
phraseology for his next question. A 
short man in his middle years, he 
wasn’t very popular with either his 
fellow Senators or his party’s 
hierarchy due to a curious unwil- 
lingness to compromise, and only 
remained in Washington because his 
constituents kept sending him back. 

‘‘Mister Buser, for the past few 
hours you’ve been bombarding this 
committee with GSA findings. I’m 
sure this committee would ap- 
preciate a brief summary. I would.” 
The witness was a tall young 
bureaucrat with ambition, well- 
dressed and self-conscious. 



‘‘Frankly, Senator, we’re in bad 
shape. Power and transportation are 
crippled by the oil shortage. Ag- 
riculture needs foreign nitrates for 
fertilizer. There isn’t an industry 
that hasn’t slowed or even stopped 
production. Our economy is grind- 
ing to a halt. Unemployment and 
crime are out of control.” 

Senator Barrett shook his head. 
‘‘But what about the programs for 
alleviating the situation?” 

‘‘We’ve set up resource priority 
and rationing systems. We’ve 
mounted massive research to find or 
develop alternative materials. Na- 
tional Guard and military units are 
helping the police fight crime and 
rationing violations. And the waste 
processing operations are hitting 
their stride. 

‘‘But it isn’t enough. Senator. 
There are too many people, too 
much unavoidable drain on re- 
sources. Practically all our 
stockpiles and reserves are gone.” 
‘‘Has your department investi- 
gated the birth-control alternative?” 
‘‘Yes we have. If we could cut 
the birth rate by twenty percent at 
once, and hold at 140 million for 
the foreseeable future, we could live 
within our resource means.” 

‘‘Theoretically, perhaps,” said 
Senator Barrett. ‘‘It might even be 
the only solution. There’s just one 
problem — the people won’t have it. 
Not even to save the nation. Mister 
Gallup and Mister Harris presented 
quite convincing poll results yester- 
day. Does your department agree?”

“We do. The I'eui ol j;ovetiiment 
control over the rij;hi lo Inivc chil- 
dren cuts even deeper iIkim (he fear 
of economic collapse.'’ 

“Why is that. Mister Buser'.’” 

“There seem lo be several 
reasons. Some feel it’s immoral. 
Some feel it’s unethical. Some feel 
it’s unjust. Some worry about the 
corruption inherent in any large 
government program, the ability of 
wealth and position to buy this ul- 
timate human commodity. Some 
Just think it’s too grotesque and dif- 
ferent. 

“But whatever the reason. 
Senator, you’re right. They don’t 
want it and they won’t accept it.’’

year seven 

The free-clinic waiting room was 
crowded even this late at night, and 
smelled of human anxiety. But Neil 
and Barbara, huddled on a corner 
bench, didn’t notice either the 
crowd or the reek. The old, sick 
and hurt milled around them; swear- 
ing, sobs and nervous chatter filled 
the air. A group of Black Knights 
were stretchered in frantically — they 
had lost more turf to the enterpris- 
ing North Beach Sensei. 

But Neil and Barbara were ob- 
livious. Despair had warped the 
universe in on them. 

It had been a cold at first, a sim- 
ple childhood case of sniffles. Even 
then the extra effort and worry had 
worn heavily on them, strained as 



AND BABY /VtAKES THREE 



they were by their meager ex- 
istence. 

After a few days Jason developed 
a fever and began breathing rapidly. 
The free clinic prescribed a course 
of antibiotics. Even at government 
subsidy prices they were hideously 
expensive. Before the embargo all 
US antibiotics had been imported 
from huge facilities in Southeast 
Asia where cheap labor and con- 
stant warmth lowered production 
costs. The US drug industry had re- 
tooled from scratch to produce 
them, and their prices reflected that 
fact. 

The small savings account, pain- 
fully nurtured with the hope of 
someday acquiring decent living ac- 
commodations, ran like water. 

Worry became fear. They had to 
attend him constantly. Barbara be- 
came intense and remote; Neil, 
working all day and staying up with 
Jason at night, neared the edge of 
total collapse. 

The light course proved too little 
too late. Jason started vomiting and 
went into convulsions. 

Fear became stark terror. 

They carried him through the 
night to the clinic. Barbara held him 
while Neil kept his knife handy. In- 
side the crudely converted Market 
Street import store a harried doctor 
grabbed him and carried him 
through the sliding white doors they 
couldn’t pass. 

That had been an hour earlier. 

They were hugging each other. 
“Dammit,” Neil whispered. “We 



should have brought him here at the 
first sniffle. If only I hadn’t been so 
sure — ’ ’ 

“Don’t you ever say that!” Bar- 
bara flared. “Neither of us knew he 
was this sick.” 

“Mister and Ms. Solarz?” 

They looked up, startled out of 
their private world. 

The doctor had emerged through 
the white doors. He stood over 
them; haggard, red-eyed from 
exhaustion and wrathful at all sense- 
less misery. 

“What is it?” Neil managed to 
ask. 

“Streptococcal pneumonia,” the 
doctor rapped back. “104° fever.” 

“Will he be all right?” they 
asked as one. 

The doctor nodded wearily. “We 
have him on streptomycin and 
penicillin. The fever should break 
tonight. He’ll have to stay here at 
least until tomorrow.” 

“Thank God,” Barbara sighed. 
“Uh . can we see him?” 

The doctor nodded. 

Jason was tucked in a bed at the 
far end of the barracks-like ward. 
He was writhing, moaning and all 
but unconscious. 

Neil and Barbara looked at him, 
at each other, then sat on both sides 
of the bed and caressed him, speak- 
ing to him .softly. 

“How long will you two be stay- 
ing?” the doctor asked bluntly. 

They looked at Jason. “Until the 
three of us can leave together,” 
Barbara said. Neil nodded in 



144

agreement.

Sharon Farber, MD, PhD, walked 
over to the laboratory’s big bright 
window and looked out. There was 
fire in the setting west, over the 
ocean. Golden light lay on the^ 
wooded hillsides and white build- 
ings of the University of California 
at Santa Cruz, the ‘resort campus’ 
of the UC system. 

“Social psychology,’’ she mut- 
tered. “Even in the midst of crisis 
we persevere. No one really cares, 
but the machinery keeps grinding 
out funds.’’ She sighed, then snap- 
ped, “Tape roll.’’ 

Click. 

“Doctors Farber and Plate. Final 
progress report.” 

Behind her the turning reels hiss- 
ed slightly. Beyond the pane birds 
sang and leaves danced in the wind, 
unheard. 

“The basic problem broke down 
into two parts; identifying persons 
with a potential for beating or 
otherwise mistreating their children, 
and stopping them from having 
children in the first place through an 
aversion-therapy technique.” 

She turned. The equipment clus- 
tered around the two surgical 
couches in the middle of the 
laboratory was quiescent but vibrant 
with associations. “We used 
psycho-probe technology to generate 
dream-like fantasies in the subjects. 
These fantasies were programmed 



by us, but were open-ended. They 
imposed only the external factors of 
a situation. The subjects’ minds 
reacted as they would in real life. 
When two subjects were linked into 
one fantasy, they could interact. 
The fantasy progressed according to 
their reactions and the program 
parameters. Different reactions 
caused the computer to take the fan- 
tasy in different directions.” 

Mike Plate was at his desk in the 
far comer, putting pages into a bind- 
er. He was a large man, quiet al- 
most to the point of non-existence. 
An ease of long partnership moved 
between them. 

“The test situation. A couple 
considering having a child was 
linked to the psych-probe. A fantasy 
was induced, based on their own 
life histories, putting them in times 
of stress involving their child. Nor- 
mal reactions on their part triggered 
a normal course for the continuation 
of the fantasy. Reactions of mis- 
treating the child triggered a differ- 
ent course. The fantasy became an 
intensified amplification of the in- 
evitable horrors — the pain inflicted, 
the child’s suffering, the batterer’s 
guilt and self-torment; a downward 
spiral degradation ending in death 
for the child, arrest, trial and 
punishment for the batterer — all 
keyed for maximum repulsion.” 

The laboratory was getting dark 
now, but neither she nor Mike 
moved to turn on the lights. 

“Our theory has been that such a 
forward look would discourage po-

tential child batterers from having 
children. Our success rate — see the 
test summaries for details — has been 
eighty-one percent. Tape end.” 

Click. 

Mike tossed the binder on top of 
the tapedeck. ‘‘.Okay. Now what?” 

She turned back to the window. 
The stars were out, ruling a shadow 
world. ‘‘Now we push it. It can’t 
help unless it’s made mandatory 
nationwide for all prospective par- 
ents. That means government ac- 
tion.” 

‘‘Fantasy land. Congress would 
never pass such a law — it’d step on 
too many toes.” 

She looked back through three 
years. To welfare agencies and in- 
terviews. To police stations and 
hospital wards. And always to the 
children. Innocence betrayed. Too, 
too many times. 

‘‘So what we do is send copies of 
our findings to every agency with 
even a remote interest. We try.”

The man at the apartment door 
identified himself as a policeman. 
Neil checked his ID carefully 
through the view-hole, then opened 
the door. “Evening,” he said 
pleasantly, age bringing economy to 
his speech. 

“Not a good one though,” the 
policeman snapped. “This belong to 
you?” 

Another policeman appeared be- 



side him, carrying a limp, twitching 
teenager. 

Barbara, behind Neil, gasped, 
“My God, Jason!” She rushed to 
him. She, Neil and the second 
policeman carried him to the living- 
room sofa. “What happened?” Neil 
demanded. 

“We raided a juicer den tonight, 
over on Mission. We took the 
dealer and the steady custmers in, 
but there aren’t enough cells for ev- 
eryone so we’re cutting the new 
faces loose. This one’s wallet says 
he lives here.” 

“Jason in a Juicer’s place?” Neil 
shook his head. “I don’t believe it. 
We taught him better.” 

The first policeman smiled cyni- 
cally from the doorway. “Did you 
now? Well, look him over. A clas- 
sic case of current OD — though the 
doc says he’s okay and will be com- 
ing out of it any time now.” 

The second policeman rejoined 
him. “Pass on a message from us 
to him when he sobers up. The next 
time we net him, he gets hard 
time.” 

They left. Numb, Neil mechani- 
cally locked the door behind them. 

Jason — long, lean, dressed in 
jeans and a T-shirt — moaned 
slightly with his private pleasure. 
But the sounds were fading away, 
and his eyes flickered with returning 
awareness. “What . What hap- 
pened? Everything was so beauti- 
ful . .” 

“You’re home,” Barbara said 
softly. “Are you okay?” 



146

“Fine . He giggled, then so- 
bered. “How’d I get home?” 

Neil stepped closer and looked 
down at him. “The police dragged 
you home. Like a stray dog. Dam- 
mit, Jason — what were you doing?” 
“I . wanted to see what it was 
like. The guys said it was ulti- 
mate.” He giggled again. “Know 
what? They were right.” 

Neil took him by the shoulders 
and shook him. “The hell they 
were! Dammit, you know where 
that route ends!” 

“Maybe you don’t know every- 
thing in the world, Dad. Ever think 
of that?” 

“You don’t believe me — go look 
in the gutters!” 

Jason glared up at him, roused, 
the current euphoria gone. “So 
what! Christ, look around! What’s 
to hang on for?” 

“You want to die? Is that it?” 
“What if 1 do?” 

Neil abruptly pulled out his knife 
and put it to Jason’s throat. 

“Neil, you’re crazy — ” Barbara 
began shrilly. 

“1 know what I’m doing.” 

She reached for the knife, but he 
pushed her away. 

Jason felt the sharp edge against 
his jugular, gulped and froze. 

“Do you really want to die?” 
Neil demanded again. “If you do, 
say so. It’ll be quick and 
painless — I promise ” 

Silence stretched taut for long 
seconds as young eyes stared into 
old ones. 



Then Jason started laughing. Not 
juice giggling, but an expression of 
real humor. “You old fraud. Put 
that thing away — you’ve made your 
point.” 

Neil put the knife back in his 
pocket. He was sick and trembling 
from shock. But the sickness came 
partly from relief. The grim stunt, 
bom of desperation, had worked. 

Barbara frowned at him, under- 
standing but not approving. 

“You don’t give much slack, do 
you?” Jason asked, rubbing his 
throat. 

Neil sat down beside him. “Your 
life is your life, but I won’t let you 
con yourself into a grave.” 

Barbara coughed for attention. 
“You two are certifiably weird.” 

They grinned at each other, then 
nodded in unison. 

Her frown surrendered to a slight 
smile. “I guess that makes three of 
us.”

Michael Killeen was an ambitious 
young public servant in an obscure 
GS-11 post at HEW. He had been 
in grade for over two years, long 
enough to realize that, to get any 
higher, he needed a boost. Finally it 
came, in the form of an odd statistic 
in one of the many reports from re- 
searchers seeking funding or sup- 
port. 

He pressed the writers of the re- 
port for details, and got them. He 
consulted department experts, and 



AND BABY MAKES THREE 



147 




they confirmed the report. Then he 
plotted a strategy for elevating his 
proposal — and himself — into lofty 
eminence. 

■ First came the marshalling of 
support; at banquets, parties, golf 
dates and in the corridors of 
Washington power. Then came the 
paperwork skirmishes, fighting 
through the bureaucratic morass. 
Finally he entered the ultimate 
struggle, a one-to-one session with 
the Secretary. 

Mister Rabkin, President Nivl- 
ing’s social conscience, sat back in 
his favorite easychair. Michael was 
facing him across the plush private 
office. 

“Okay, I’ve looked over your 
proposal,’’ Mister Rabkin said. 
“You’ve got ten minutes to con- 
vince me.” 

Michael nodded. “You’ll note it 
was purely an accidental result of 
their technique.” 

“A mighty hard one to accept. 
What do you plan to attack next, 
baseball or apple pie?” 

“The facts are disillusioning, but 
they are facts. The experiment was 
large enough to be statistically 
valid.” 

“I’ll buy that for now. Go on.” 

“Twenty-one percent of the 
couples, exposed to realistic visions 
of the pitfalls of parenthood, de- 
cided not to have children.” 

“Which means?” 

“Note the computer extrapola- 
tion; applied nationwide, this de- 
crease in the birthrate would easily 



fit within the resource/population 
survival curve.” 

Mister Rabkin frowned. “So 
would drowning every fourth baby. 
Your proposal would be just as 
popular.” 

“There’s no alternative. Do you 
want to watch the country go under 
because we haven’t the courage to 
bite the bullet?” 

Mister Rabkin paused, then; 
“The people would never buy it. 
It’s almost as bad as compulsory 
birth control.” 

“No, it’s not! That’s the vital 
difference.” 

“How so?” 

“We Just require any couple — 
married or not — that wants a child 
to first take the look forward. If 
they still wish to go ahead, fine.” 
“But would a law requiring that 
be effective? After all, how many 
babies are conceived with that 
much, ah . , . premeditation?” 
“These days, about seventy-three 
percent. Modem contraception 
techniques have done much to 
eliminate ‘accidental’ pregnancies.” 
“That’s still not enough.” 

“With my program’s heavy fines 
for \Mllful violations, that number 
will go higher. The public education 
provisions will help too.” 

“You have a lot of faith in the 
people.” 

“I know it won’t be one hundred 
percent effective — what program 
is — but it’ll be effective enough to 
meet the present emergency.” 

“But think of the cost! The corn- 



148 



GALAXY 




puters and so on would have to be 
available everywhere. How could 
we possibly afford it — especially 
now?” 

“We can’t afford not to. It’ll be 
steep — about as bad as our share of 
Social Security — but we can handle 
it. You saw the projections.” 
Michael’s long preparation was pay- 
ing off. He had all the answers. 

“Would the people buy it 
though? Some folks would surely 
think we’re trying to hypnotize 
couples into not having babies.” 
“That can be disproved by 
operating the program honestly and 
openly at all levels — a novelty for 
us, I admit, but a necessary one.” 
“I’d watch that mouth if I were 
you.” 

“Sorry. We can also emphasize 
the other benefit — -discouraging p)o- 
tentially lousy parents from having 
children.” 

“You might actually have some- 
thing there. Nothing lower than a 
child beater.” 

“We’ve been needing something 
like this for a long time.” 

“Even so, you’re talking about a 
gross invasion of personal privacy. 
It’d probably require a Constitu- 
tional amendment.” 

Michael shrugged. “Then we’ll 
push one through. Properly pre- 
sented, the program can be sold. 
We can bring in Madison Avenue.” 
“It’d be one hell of a fight.” 
“The disaster . out there,” 
Michael pointed to the window, 
“will sell the program for us. 



Bizarre or not, it’s better than no 
solution at all.” 

Mister Rabkin looked at him al- 
most in hatred. “I’ll take it up with 
the President. If he goes for it, then 
we can start worrying about Con- 
gress. Good day.”

Neil opened his eyes. 

Barbara opened her eyes. 

They were lying face-up on a soft 
couch, side-by-side, hand-in-hand. 
They were dressed in street clothes, 
but their heads lay under canopies 
studded with electronic components. 
A white-smocked techno monitored 
a console set into the far wall of the 
small hospital room. 

Memories fought against mem- 
ories as one reality replace another. 
Neil’s throat was dry, but he man- 
aged to croak, “You . okay. 
Barb?” 

“Yes, love.” She squeezed his 
hand firmly. 

Then Doctor Reynolds leaned 
over them, lifting them out from 
under the canopies, and handed them 
plastic cups of water. He was a 
compactly built, amiable man with 
a steel -trap mind and an office wall 
covered with degrees. “Here, drink 
this. Do you feel okay?” 

They nodded. 

“Good. Let’s go to my sanctum 
and relax.” He led them out of the 
lab, down a corridor and into his 
office. “They have a heavy 
schedule for the dream room to- 
day.”

He settled behind his desk; Bar- 
bara and Neil sat on a sofa facing 
him. “Uh . did we pass?” Bar- 
bara asked urgently. 

He smiled. ”1 don’t know. You 
tell me.” 

“Huh?” 

“No one monitors or records 
dream-room experiences. Against 
the law, not to mention common 
decency. Only you two know how 
your experience went.” 

He kxjked intently at each of 
them. “It’s up to you now. Do you 
need some time to make up your 
minds?' ' 

They looked at each other. 
“No,” Barbara said without hesita- 
tion. “We’re decided. We want to 
go ahead.” Neil smiled his agree- 
ment. 

“Congratulations.” Doctor 

Reynolds .scribbled his name on a 
form and handed it to Barbara. “I’ll 
file my copy tonight; give yours to 
your OB when the time comes. 
That’s all there is to it. Good 
luck.” 

They left, wrapped in each other 
and oblivious to all else. Doctor 
Reynolds leaned back and smiled. 
His many years in BC-Dep had 
given him something akin to a sixth 
sense concerning his couples. These 
two would do well; raise healthy 
children and enrich their own lives 
in the process. These good cases 
more than made up for the unpleas- 
ant ones. 

Such were the simple pleasures of 
a psychiatrist. ★

Dear Dr. Poumelle, 

I’ve been reading science fiction ever 
since I was old enough to read, and I 
think I’ve always believed that I would 
live to see the conquest of space and all 
those other great things I read about in 
stories by Heinlein, Asimov, and the 
rest. Lately, however. I’ve been having 
some doubts about whether any of us 
will live to see that future. Part of my 
pessimism stems from reading books 
like The Population Bomb and The 
Limits to Growth, and realizing that the 
grim future predicted by Jay Forrester’s 
world model computer programs is 
becoming the dismal reality of our 
present. We have seen the future, and it 
is nasty; the so-called energy crisis is 
just the tip of the iceberg. Like most 
people 1 wouldn’t worry too much about 
it if the collapse of civilization as we 
know it were a distant possibility in the 
remote future, but it could very' well 
happen during my lifetime, and that 
worries me. 

Your articles have been showing us 
the kind of future we can have, and 
should have. In the July, 1975, 
ANALOG Norman Spinrad pointed out 
that we are at a turning point in history; 
we are rapidly approaching a point of 
no return as far as non-renewable 



resources are concerned. The 
“doomsday curves” of The Club of 
Rome show us where we are going if 
present trends continue. Fortunately, as 
any true S-F fan knows, any alternate 
future is equally possible. 
Unfortunately, because human nature is 
what it is, the most probable future is 
the one that lies down the path of least 
resistance; and that, also unfortunately, 
is the very path our society has been 
following for years. As you, yourself, 
said at MidAmeriCon, “We have 
nowhere to go but up. .or down.” 

Well, you know what I’m talking 
about, so I’ll get directly to the point of 
this letter, which is: 

The same technology that got us into 
this mess can get us out again. We can 
prevent economic stagnation and famine 
and nuclear war, and make all our 
science fiction dreams come true within 
our own lifetimes, but it won’t happen 
by itself; it will happen only if we make 
it happen! 

But in order to make it happen we 
have to make our views known to our 
elected representatives, the lawmakers 
in Washington. We must write to 
Congress and to President Carter. I 
have, and I’ve also written to you and 
Ben Bova and Isaac Asimov and the 
L-5 Society and. Well, I’m Just 
trying to do my small part to change the 
course of human history. The L-5 
Society, in commenting on an earlier 
letter 1 wrote to them concerning the 
possibility that Carter might cut the 
NASA budget, wrote, “The Society 
can’t get involved in lobbying. .” I 
don’t know where the NSl stands on 
this (I joined quite some time ago, but 
have still not received any 
communication from the NSl), but 
lobbying is exactly what we need. We 



DIRECTIONS 



153 



must try to repeat the kind of 
letter-writing campaign that the Star 
Trek people launched against President 
Ford. In his April editorial Ben Bova 
made the same points that 1 am making, 
but he limited it to the general case. 1 
am being more specific. 

Tbe future belongs to those who plan 
for it. If we do not plan well enough, 
we may not have a future. Are we 
going to be like the ants, or will we end 
up like the grasshopper? I don’t know 
about you, but I want the rest of my life 
to be pleasant and prosperous, and I just 
don’t see it happening unless some 
major changes are made in the way we 
run this Spaceship. Some of my friends 
are actively dropping out of what they 
consider a dying society; they seem to 
think they can survive on a 

self-sufficient farm, out away from the 
cities. If things start getting too bad in a 
few years I may join them, but I would 
much rather avoid that particular future 
and become an asteroid miner instead. 

I joined a relatively small group of 
active space enthusiasts at the Worldcon 
here in Kansas City, and have become 
very active myself. We call ourselves 
United For Our Expanded Space 
Programs, UFOESP (catchy initials, but 
they lead some people to think we’re a 
bunch of flying saucer nut-cultists). We 
have a very informal organization; those 
who feel active act; those who feel 
passive pass. We have no Big Names 
(yet), just S-F fans, students, engineers, 
etc. We share a common dream, the 
same dream you share, judging from the 
contents of your recent articles in 
GALAXY. We are making our views 
known to those turkeys on Capitol Hill, 
but we’d like some help. 

Remember when you and Spider and 
the others were telling the gathered fans 



about your “favorite future’’? 1 was the 
tall guy with the beard who asked you 
what we, as individuals, could do to 
make the future turn out right. Well, 1 
know what to do, and now I’m asking 
you to urge your many readers and 
influential friends to do the same. 

Here are a few of the things we want 
Congress to do: 

1 . Sptend whatever money is 

necessary to fund fusion R&D. I, 
personally, would like to see us take the 
Manhattan Project approach in getting 
controlled fusion power “on line” as 
soon as possible. Consider the 

implications of this true statement: With 
enough energy we can do anythingl 

2. Just in case fusion doesn’t pan out 
in time, appropriate money for at least 
one prototype solar power satellite. If it 
proves harmful to the environment we 
can still use it to power orbital 
factories. 

3. Increase the NASA budget. 
Increase all research and development 
that could lead to a solution to the 
energy crisis. Add a few millions to 
develop NERVA and DUMBO and 
laser launch systems. Maintain or 
increase the level of funding for the 
Shuttle. 

4. Provide tax incentives for 
companies that wish to participate in the 
Third Industrial Revolution. 

There’s more, much more, but you 
get the idea. A non-profit organization 
like L-5 cannot legally lobby, but an 
unorganized rabble can work wonders. 
We’re not interested in “playing club” 
or building a little empire; all we really 
want is enough Federal money (after 
all, it’s our tax money) to get us into 
space and do some of the things we 
know are possible. We, as individual 
voters, can exert enormous pressure.

GALAXY 




Jimmy Carter ' is providing all 
Americans with the opportunity to make 
our views known on the energy crisis. 
He may not be a “real” engineer, but 
he seems to understand what’s really 
happening around here. We, the people 
who read science fiction and are 
involved in various aspects of 
technology (I’m an engineer, myself), 
seem to have a greater awareness of the 
nature of the problems facing Spaceship 
Earth than some of our fellow 
passengers; 1 think we have a morale 
obligation (Heinlein'.s definition: it tends 
to promote the survival of the species) 
to convince the rest of the population 
that we are headed toward a crisis on 
this planet of limited resources, and that 
Space represents a very good solution to 
those problems. We have already begun 
to explore space. We now have the 
technology to exploit space. I mean, 
let’s face facts: the re.sources of space, 
like space itself, are literally infinite. If 
we can get out there we won’t have to 
worry about any “limits to growth” for 
a long time. 

There is a lot of apathy and inertia to 
overcome, and the sooner we start 
overcoming them the better will be our 
chance for ultimate success. 

Like a fire alarm salesman once told 
me, “You’ve gotta BURN those 
people. You’ve gotta make ’em feel the 
flames and taste the smoke. Then you 
can make a living selling fire alarms.” 
We’ve got a similar sales job to do. 
Many people still seem to think that the 
energy crisis will go away if they ignore 
it, or that it is nothing more than a 
massive rip-off perpetrated by the oil 
companies. We must convicnce the 
public that Spaceship Earth is running 
out of “consumables” and that some of 
the passengers down in steerage are 



busy building atomic bombs. .We 
must convince our Congresscritters that 
Space is not just a sci-fi dream; it is 
absolutely vital to the long-term survival 
of our race. 

Even as you read this letter, many 
Congressmen are getting letters from a 
whole new constituency, letters that ask 
for money for asteroid capture projects 
and nuclear rockets and solar power 
satellites. If we can get enough people 
to write similar letters, and let those 
politicians know that how they vote on 
space appropriations will determine how 
we vote in the next election, we can get 
all those things, and more, in our own 
lifetimes. We have nothing to lose 
(except a world of perpetual poverty) 
and literally everything to gain. The 
advent of the Space Shuttle and the 
coming barrage of science fiction 
movies should help, but it is up to 
us— W/ o( US' to get this thing off the 
ground (no pun intemled)

Dear Mr. Baen; 

On a talk-show last night, from a 
local radio station, I found myself 
listening to some character who claims 
to have proof that the Apollo program 
was a fake. If not the entire space 
program, at least the manned landings, 
says he, were staged.

155 




Well, I was fair and open minded 
about the whole thing, and heard him 
out. (I must admit I giggled a little once 
and awhile.) When it was over I went 
to sleep feeling quite put upon by the 
fraud. He is even doing a film on the 
theory of our ‘ space program being 
faked. 

Instead of going into more detail, as 
you have no doubt heard of this nut, I 
have a question. 

What are we going to do with 
lunatics like him, short of shooting him 
and putting him out of our misery? 

Also, I am quite pleased with 
Galaxy. I have never been an avid 
magazine reader, prefering novels and 
anthologies. I now find myself eagerly 
awaiting each issue, and absorbing the 
entire thing on the same day it is 
delivered. I’m new to your magazine, 
but I think I’ll stay around for awhile. 

If you don’t mind. 

Sincerely, 

TTiomas T. Watson

Actually, I don’t think I have heard of 
this particular nut, though I have heard 
of many like him (it is an interesting 
aspect of that particular syndrome that 
shortly after proving that our entire 
Space Program is a fraud that same 
person will often proceed to tell you 
about the UFO Coverup 
Conspiracy. .). As for what to do 
about them, I think the best course is to 
leave them alone; anything that would 
seriously discommode them would have 
vastly greater deleterious effects on our 
society than whatever benefits might 
accrue from silencing a few mental 
cases. And by all means, stay 
around — and welcome aboard! 



Dear Jim; 

It is a very good thing that you, in 
your Galaxy editorials, have been 
giving us reasons for the space 
program — reasons that we readers can 
use to help convince the paynim, so to 
speak. Dr. Poumelle, also, has been 
doing this same thing in greater 
depth — telling us what can be done with 
space / in space. I think that it’s now 
time to change your emphasis. I think 
that what you, Jim Baen, should be 
doing now in your editorials is telling 
us and letting us know how we can 
influence the political process to gel 
more money for NASA. The many 
reasoned arguments that have been 
published in the pages of GALAXY 
need to be seen by those that wield the 
purse strings in congress. 

I am told that a congressman 
considers 40 pieces of mail on a single 
bill before him highly significant. 40 
pieces of mail. That’s not a heck of a 
whole lot. I’m sure that letters to 
specific congressmen would be even 
more likely to do good — who are these 
people? And are there others besides 
those in congress that should be written 
to? What other avenues of effort besides 
letter writing are available to we Galaxy 
readers to try to enlarge the US space 
program? Are there space-oriented 
pressure groups / lobby groups? If so, 
where are they / who are they? What 
are they doing? These are the sort of 
things I’d like to see in Galaxy these 
days. A highly specialised ‘Washington 
Watch.’ 

It won’t really take a lot to turn 
around the funding for the space 
program, but the |X)litical legwork that 
we as citizens must do to obtain 
increased NASA funding will not do

Yon have a good point: I’ll see what / 
can do. 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

The J.E. Pournelle articles are 
fantastic! 1 would like to see a few 
articles on recent developments in aging 
research. 

I think that greater emphasis should 
be put on biological research (of course, 
this will require space facilities for 
zero-g processing and a safe place to do 
genetic recombination research). After 
all, this generation could be the one that 
makes it to the stars, if we just live 
long enough. 

I am president of a small group of 
university and high school students 
interested in promoting space 
colonization and longevity research. We 
have given presentations at a school and 
a Lions' Club, and plan to continue 
working with community organizations 
to educate the public about the benefits 
of space. We are also starting a 
letter-writing campaign, to political 
leaders, major news magazines and 
even local newspapers. Any Galaxy 
readers in the central Ohio area who are 
interested in the L-5 colony-powersat 
idea and/or other fields of space exploi- 
tation, or are interested in recent aging 
research developments, may get in 
touch with us at the following address; 
Thank you for your superlative mag.

Dear Jim, 

Frank Herbert again shows us the 
master writer that he is! “The Dosadi 
Experiment” explores a world which is 
very unlike the world that he has 
presented in the Dune trilogy. 
Nevertheless, with the same artistic and 
literary skill, Frank Herbert presents a 
story which is equally dramatic. Though 
much more subtle, the unfolding drama 
on the planet Dosadi provides an 
exploratory theme of moral 
consciousness. Frank Herbert certainly 
outdid himself in this new story and has 
a Hugo contention. 

Thank you Frank Herbert and 
certainly thank you Gala.xy for 
publishing this great serial. Speaking of 
your magazine, it has certainly become 
the most provocative science fiction 
publication around! 

Sincerely yours, 
Roy D. Schickedanz

You’ll be giving a gift of unique value. GALAXY is going 
for the best in established authors and new talent. In the 
year to come that means important works by writers 
such as Frederik Pohl and Jack Williamson, rising stars 
such as C. J. Cherryh (winner of the 1977 John W. Camp- 
bell Award for best new writer), and hitherto undiscov- 
ered writers making their first appearances in GALAXY. 
Readers will also be able to explore the frontiers of 
science and technology with J. E. Pournelle, get the 
lowdown on the latest books from Paul Walker and 
follow other regular features that have made GALAXY 
outstanding.
