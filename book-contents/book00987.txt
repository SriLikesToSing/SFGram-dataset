Y ou may have noticed that 
GALAXY is under new 
ownership and wondered 
why a profitable magazine should 
have to change hands. The an- 
jBwer is simple, though some of the 
effects were not — the previous 
publishers, being unfamiliar with 
science fiction, were unable to 
integrate the magazine into their 
publishing program. 

With our new ownership, a lot 
of things that have been wrong 
»re going to be corrected. 

Most important of all, the edi- 
torial and production standards 
are going to be changed onJy in 
the direction of improvenfent. For 
example, now that the splendid 
Heinlein serial has ended, we have 
a sparkling novella, WORLD 
WITHOUT CHILDREN, by 
Damon Knight, and, beginning 
in the January issue, a dazzlingly 
brilliant serial, THE DEMOL- 
ISHED MAN, by Alfred Bester. 
Either one would be worth the 
35c tab, but in addition there are 
the fine novelets and short stories 
( . and from March on, we’re 
starting an exciting monthly fea- 
ture by Willy Ley, in which he 
will cover significant develop- 
ments in science and answer your 
questions either in the depart- 
gnent or by mail! 

% 



Start sending your questions 
along to us now. 

All this has disrupted schedules 
severely, delaying the semi-an- 
nual story ratings a full month. 
Here are your selections, issue by 
issue, for Volume 2 . plus my 
comments: 

• April: Betelgeuse Bridge, Wil- 
liam Tenn; Inside Earth, Poul 
Anderson; I, the Unspeakable, 
Walt Sheldon; Nice Girl with 5 
Husbands, Fritz Leiber; Field 
Study, Peter Phillips; The 
Marching Morons, C. M. Korn- 
bluth. 

Many readers explained the 
reasons for their preferences, all 
personal, of course, but I wouldn’t 
attempt to rate the stories. One 
good restraining factor is that 
every item in the book is to be 
anthologized. 

• May: Hostess, Isaac Asimov; 
Ask Me Anything, Damon 
Knight; Bridge Crossing, Dave 
Dryfoos; Man of Destiny, John 
Christopher. 

Here, too, all stories are signed 
up for book publication. Even the 
article, Africa’s Mysterious Mam- 
mal by Willy Ley, will probably 
be included in his next volume 
on natural history. 

• June: Don’t live in the Past, 
Damon Knight; Angel’s Egg, Ed- 



CAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



gar Pangborn; Hunt the Hunter, 
Kris Neville. 

The first two are scheduled for 
anthologies; the third may be 
by the time this appears. Angel’s 
Egg. by the way, had me wor- 
ried. I liked the story tremen- 
dously, but was uncertain that 
readers would. They did. 

• July: Appointment in Tomor- 
row, Fritz Leiber; Syndrome 
Johnny, Charles Dye; Common 
Denominator, John D. MacDon- 
ald; Venus Is a Man’s World, 
William Tenn; Pen Pal, Milton 
Lesser. 

All these will be in book form. 

• August: Beyond Bedlam, Wy- 
man Guin; The Pilot and the 
Bushman, Sylvia Jacobs; The 
Fire and the Sword, Frank M. 
Robinson; Operation Distress, 
Lester del Rey ; A Little Journey, 
Ray Bradbury; Pictures Don’t 
Lie, Katherine MacLean. 

Of these, only Operation Dis- 
tress has not been tapped for 
book publication, and that may 
be by this time. Again I took a 
long chance, for Beyond Bedlam 
had a theme that normally 
frightens people, and the plot was 
sharply divorced from the melo- 
dramatic school of writing. 
Reader response, however, was 
vast both in quantity and ap- 
preciation. This was the issue 
that was prematurely withdrawn 
from dirbulatibn, so, if you want 
a copy, send 35c. 



• September: Cabin Boy, Damon 
Knight; If You Was a Moklin, 
Murray Leinster; The Sense of 
Wonder, Milton Lesser; What Is 
Posat?, Phyllis Sterling Smith; 
The Biography Project, Dudley; 
Dell. 

The first three and the fifth are 
signed up for anthologies. 

I don’t think serials or articles 
can be rated — there’s no reason- 
able way to compare them witK 
novelets or short stories. But in 
the case of The Puppet Masters 
by Robert A. Heinlein, the re- 
action was so enthusiastic that 
some mention of it must be made. 
Although the serial was not com- 
pleted, most readers insisted on 
rating it against the three pre- 
vious ones, with this result: 

The Puppet MasterSj Robert A, 
Heinlein; Mars Child, Cyril 
Judd; Time Quarry, Clifford D. 
Simak; Tyrann, Isaac Asimov. 

All have appeared as books or 
are scheduled to, which, with our 
shorter fiction and most articles, 
means that about 95% of the first 
year’s issues will wind up be- 
tween hard covers. It may sound 
like a boast to some sensitive 
readers, but the fact is that no 
other periodical of any kind 
whatever has achieved this al- 
most unbelievable record. 

Are We proud of it? Well, what 
do you think? And our second 
year looks even better than this 
first -^H. L. GOLU

WORLD WITHOUT CHILDREM

ners for Teeners, One Hundred 
Things a Boy Can Make. 

The last recorded birth had 
been two hundred years ago. 

That child — who had also been 
the last to wear a snowsuit, the 
last to cut his finger playing with 
knives, and the last to learn 
^out women — had now reached 
• he physiological age of twenty- 
-ive years, • and looked even 
younger owing to his excellent 
condition. His name was George 
Miller; he had been a great curi- 
osity in his day and a good many 
people still referred to him as 
The Child. 

George did his best to live up 
to the name. Ever3^hing he did 
was essentially outr€; everything 
he wore was outlandish; every- 
thing he said was outrageous. He 
got along better with most 
women than with most men. He 
said the sort of things to women 
that made them say, “Oh, 
George.'” half wincing, half melt- 
ing. 

At the moment he was busy 
explaining to Lily Hoffman, head 
of the Human Conservation 
League, why he had never per- 
manently given up drinking or 
smoking. 

•'Oh, George," said Lily. 

“No, really,” said George earn- 
estly. “You say having fun will 
take ten per cent off my life. 
Well, but Art Levinson tells me 
that my present life expectancy 



is probably somewhere around 
three thousand years. So if he’s 
right, and you’re right, my dis- 
graceful habits won’t catch up 
to me until 5062 A.D. and by that 
time I expect to be glad enough 
to lie down.” 

Lily tilted her careful blonde 
curls forward to avoid a drink 
in the hand of a wandering guest. 
“That’s an average, George,” she 
said. “And of course it’s only a 
guess, because nobody who’s had 
the longevity treatments early in 
life has passed away from old 
age yet. Now I personally believe 
that it’s possible to live for ten 
thousand years or more. And, 
George, just suppose you did pass 
away in 5062 from overindul- 
gence, and the very next year 
they found a way to extend the 
life-span even morel” 

“Good Lord,” said George, 
looking distressed. "That would 
be a laugh on me, wouldn’t it?” 

“Really, George, this is a seri* 
ous — ” 

George put his hand on her 
arm. “You’re right,” he said, with 
fervor. “I might be throwing 
away the best centuries of my 
life. I’ll stop this very minute.” 
He took a beautifully chased sil- 
ver cigarette case out of his breast 
pocket and emptied it into his 
hand. "If you’ll excuse me,” he 
said, rising, “I’ll go and throw 
these in the fireplace so as not to 
be tempted.”

She called after him, “George, 
stick to it. That’s the imp>ortant 
thing. You’ve quit before, you 
know.” 

“I know,” said George humbly. 

Carrying the cigarettes at arm’s 
length, as if they were a clutch 
of poisonous serpents, he ma- 
neuvered his slender body among 
the standing, sitting and peram- 
bulating guests until he reached 
the fireplace,' 

“Hello, Luther," he said to a 
gray-haired, comfortably plump 
man wearing rimless spectacles. 
“I’m enjoying your party.” He 
dropped the cigarettes ceremoni- 
ously behind a charred log. 

“Again?” asked Luther Wheat- 
ley amiably. 

“Lily talked me into it,” 
George told him. “You ought to 
try virtue some time, Luther„ It 
gives you a sort of intense feeling, 
an I-am-the-master-of-my-fate 
kind of thing. Besides, it’s an in- 
exhaustible source of conversa- 
tion. And then when you finally 
succumb, you have such a de- 
lightful sense of wickedness. I 
think everybody ought to abstain 
from everything once in a while. 
Just to keep from taking it for 
granted.” 

“George,” said Luther, frown- 
ing in concentration, “I believe 
that is the same discovery that 
you first announced to me when 
you were about twenty-three. 
How do you manage to — shall I 



say — keep your mind so fresh?” 

“How do you manage to re- 
member every damned thing I’v 
said over the course of a hundret! 
■and fifty-odd years?” Georg.- 
countered irritably. 

“You always say the same 
thing.” One of Luther’s cats wan - 
dered by, and Luther stooped t> > 
pick it up. It was a pretty thin.f , 
marked like a Siamese, but wit . 
long, light fur. It stared at Luthe • 
with offended dignity and mad 
a noise in its throat. 

“Haven’t seen that one before, 
have I?” George asked. 

“No. She’s a distant descendant 
of Mimi, though — sixteen genera- 
tions removed. You remember 
Mimi.” 

“I do, indeed. A great cat, 
Luther. You weren’t worthy of 
her. Pity they’re so short-lived, 
isn’t it?” 

“That’s why I like them,” 
Luther said, letting the cat drip 
from his hands like golden taffy. 
“People are so inconveniently 
permanent. Art! Is that you? 
I thought you were in Pasadena 
for the season.” 

A stocky, owl-faced man with 
a shining bald pate put his hand 
on Wheatley’s shoulder. “I flew 
in especially to see you, Luther," 
he said. “Hello, George. You, 
too.” He shook hands with them 
in turn. “Can we go somewhere 
and talk? It’s important. Is 
Morey here?” 



WORIO WITHOUT CHILDREN

Luther peered across the room. 
“He’s around somewhere.” He 
stopped a man carrying a tray 
of cocktail glasses and said, 
“Find Mr. Stiles for me, will you? 
Tell him I’d like to see him in 
my study.” He took the owlish 
man’s arm and gently propelled 
him toward the door, leaving 
George to trail along. “How are 
you, you dog-robber? How are 
the famous Levinson fruit-flies?” 
“How are the cats?” 
“Esthetically rewarding, which 
Is more than I can say for your 
noxious pets.” 

Luther opened the study door 
and ushered them in. It was an 
almost fanatically tidy place, like 
the rest of Luther’s apartment. 
There was a small window look- 
ing out on the roof-tops of Ven- 
ice; the Rio Foscari was on the 
opposite side of the building. 
There were a desk, a work table, 
an easy chair and two straight 
chairs. The walls were covered 
with shelves of books : mostly his- 
tory and genetics, with the usual 
peppering of salty novels. 

Two cats were in the easy chair, 
one in each of the straight chairs, 
and one asleep on the table. 

“Dump them off,” said Luther, 
•etting an example and easing 
fcimself into the one comfortable 
chair. “You can sit on the table, 
George — you’ve got the youngest 
and most resilient ligaments.” 

A man yvith the long, cartila- 



genous face of an honest son of 
toil appeared in the doorway. His 
collar was too big and too stiff, 
his tie creased and askew, and 
his short iron-gray hair was 
fiercely rumpled like a eagle’s 
nest. He looked as if he might 
bite, until he smiled; then he 
looked unexpectedly shy and 
friendly. 

His voice was a subdued rum- 
ble : “Hello, Art. Glad to see you. 
What’s the bad news?” 

“It’s bad, all right,” said Lev- 
inson. His round face was serious 
as he bit off the end of a cigar 
with a quick, nervous gesture. 
“Shut the door, will you, Morey?” 

He looked at the unlit cigar 
and put it down. “Listen,” he 
said, “I could build up to this 
gradually and spare your nerves, 
but I haven’t got the patience. I 
found out something last week 
that scared me to my toenails.” 

He stopped and glanced at 
each of them. They seemed im- 
pressed. George did, too, but 
grim seriousness always im- 
pressed him. It made him feel 
uncomfortable enough to want to 
drive it off with a facetious re- 
mark, but before he had a chance 
to think of one, Luther said to 
Levinson, “You really are upset, 
Art, and that’s something you 
don’t do easily.” He looked just 
above George’s head. “Are you 
sure we’re the ones you want to 
tell?” 






GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Now look here,” George said, 
beginning to get angry. “I may 
be the youngest of you, but I’m 
not a kid to be — ” 

“I wanted George here,” Levin- 
son interrupted. “He is younger, 
and because of that he’s inclined 
to be less stodgy. Also, he has 
more of the adventurousness of 
youth, and that may be damned 
important." 

George sat %ack, compressing 
his lips and giving one emphatic 
nod. 

•“What scared you. Art?” asked 
Stiles. 

Levinson broke the cigar with 
bitter abruptness. “The human 
race,” he said bluntly, “is nine- 
tenths sterile.” 

fT^HE others looked at him in 
shocked silence. George 
glanced around, saw that nobody 
else was ready to speak, and 
asked, “How did you find out?” 
“Restocking my sperm and ova 
banks,” said Levinson. “I’ve been 
keeping them for a good many 
years, you may remember. There 
are a lot of men and women liv- 
ing today who have never had 
children. Good stock — stock we’ll 
need when and if the race starts 
breeding again, and yet any one 
of those people might get killed 
in an accident and we’d lose it. 
So I’ve been keeping up the 
banks, though I never thought 
I’d see them used for another 



couple of thousand years. But 
nine out of ten donors are now 
sterile.” 

“You checked?” asked Luther. 

“Naturally. I’ve got samples 
from North and South America, 
from Europe, Asia, Africa. All 
the same. There it is — we’re 
standing on top of the last slide 
down to hell.” 

Stiles looked puzzled. He said, 
“How do you know it’s going to 
get worse. Art?” 

“It’s that kind of thing — a pro- 
gressive change. Morphological 
deterioration. Sperm with two 
tails, three tails, no tail, or all 
but motionles's. Ova that can’t be 
fertilized. I’ve made some tenta- 
tive charts. I haven’t got enough , 
data yet for accuracy, but the 
breakdown seems to begin in men 
who are physiologically at least 
forty and chronologically at least 
three hundred. In women, a little 
earlier. That includes damn near 
everybody. I’m not kidding, 
Morey. In ’five to ten years more, 
there won’t be enough viable 
stock left to start the human race 
again.” 

“Have you got any idea what’s 
causing it. Art?” George asked. 

“Only the obvious one — it’s 
just one more side effect of long- 
evity. You know that in gross 
terms what the treatments do is 
to slow down your catabolic rate. 

In about fifty years, in other 
words, you age about as much as 

« 



WORLD WITHOUT CHILDREN. 



you would naturally in one year. 
At first it was thought that that 
was all the treatments did, but 
we know better now. We have the 
expected increase in ‘diseases of 
the aged’ — ^kidneys, heart, liver, 
arteriosclerosis, calcium deposits 
and so on — ^but we also have a 
rash of things nobody figured on. 
Cancer, for instance, came close 
to wiping out the race until they 
licked it at the Gandhi Center 
about two hundred years ago. 
Then there’s an unexpected drop 
in resistance to respiratory infec- 
tions along about age-of-record 
250. And now this.” 

“What have you done about 
it?” asked Stiles. “You talk to 
anybody in the government?” 
“Sure.” Levinson picked up a 
fresh cigar and bit into it sav- 
agely. “I talked to Van Dam, the 
Public Health Commissioner, 
after sitting around his office for 
three days, and he took it up 
with President Golightly. He 
brought me back Golightly’s an- 
swer. Here it is.” 

He took a folded piece of paper 
out of his vest pocket. 

“ ‘Thank you for your interest- 
ing report, which I am turning 
over to the appropriate depart- 
ment for further study. In reply 
to your question, resumption of 
wholesale breeding at this time 
would be prejudicial to world 
peace and security, and no such 
measure will be entertained until 

10 



all other avenues have been ex- 
hausted.’ ” 

He stuffed the note back into 
his pocket. 

“What about those other ave- 
nues, Art?” asked Stiles. 

“Nonexistent. There is no 
known cure for morphological 
sterility in men or women, and 
not even a promising line of re- 
search. We’ve got to start breed- 
ing, that’s all. No Way out of it 
But that trained-seal department 
of Golightly’s will kick the prob- 
lem around for ten, twenty, fifty 
years. By that time we might as 
well start carving our own monu- 
ments. Prejudicial to world peace 
and security,” he added bitterly. 

Stiles scratched his ear, look- 
ing mournful. “It would kick up 
kind of a rumpus. Art,” he said, 
“He’s right there.” 

Levinson turned on him. “Try 
to see a little further than your 
own union for once, Morey. 
Would you let the whole blasted 
race die just to preserve the 
shortage of masons?” 

“ ’Tain’t only that,” said Stiles, 
unruffled. “We’d be ready for an- 
other war as soon as the popu- 
lation got big enough, for one 
thing.” 

“Let’s have a couple of more 
voices here,” said Levinson, 
“Luther, any comment?” 

Luther sighed. “Shall I get out 
my checkbook now. Art, or do 
you want me: to wait until I’ve 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



liquidated some of my holdings?” 

Levinson shrugged at him. “It’s 
going to cost you, all right,” he 
agreed. “All three of you. We’ll 
need about three hundred thou- 
sand credits to start. More later.” 

“Much more. Art?” ' Luther 
queried. 

“Plenty. We’ve got to set up 
at least half a dozen birth cen- 
ters, each equipped to handle up- 
ward of a thousand children and 
meet all their needs, if necessary, 
over a twenty-year period. We’ll 
build the centers, or buy and 
adapt them. They’ve got to be 
in out-of-tlie-way places and ade- 
quately camouflaged to fool the 
Security Police. We’ve got to staff 
them, service them, arrange for 
protection — and we’ve got to do 
it fast.” He looked at each of 
them in turn. “I know that all 
three of you are worth several 
million apiece. I may want all of 
it before we’re through.” 

There was a short silence. Then 
Stiles coughed and looked apolo- 
getic. “Let’s just clear up a few 
points. Art. One thing, it seems 
to me that this cloak-and-dagger 
stuff is unnecessary. Why not 
take it to the people? Force the 
Golightly gang to repeal the birth 
prohibition?” 

Levinson said, "You’ve done 
some publicity, Morey. How long 
do you think it would take to put 
such a program over, on a world- 
wide scale?” * 



Stiles frowned. “A year, may- 
be . He winced comically. 
“All right, all right, I know what 
you’re going to say. It would 
take Golightly just about twenty- 
four hours to throw us all in 
pokey. I was just stalling on that 
one, I guess. But here’s another 
thing. Art. As I get it, you’re fig- 
uring on six thousand kids or 
more in the first generation. Why 
so many?” , 

“Simply because I’m afraid we 
won’t be able to do much better. 
If we could manage a million, we 
still couldn’t save all the useful, 
strains that are still viable. It’s 
like this, Morey: Suppose there 
are only five men and five women 
in the world. Each one has some 
quality that the others don’t in 
his heredity. One has mechanical 
ingenuity, another one leadership, 
another one artistic imagination, 
and so on. If one of those couples 
fails to reproduce, there are two 
qualities gone forever. Multiply 
that by a billion and there’s our 
problem.” 

He waved his cigar at Stiles’s 
nose. “Don’t forget, we’re down 
to ten per cent of our stock al- 
ready. The best we can hope to 
do is to patch together some kind 
of crude imitation of the human 
race, and hope it will work. If 
we manage to save homo sap at 
all. we’ll be damned lucky.” 

Stiles leaned forward, elbows 
on knees, and laced his big fingers 



WO RIO WITHOUT CHIIDRCN 



It 



together. “Art, I don’t know — " 
he said slowly. 

George, who was facing the 
door, saw it open a crack. He said 
quietly, “We have visitors.” 

As the others turned, the door 
swung open all the way. A 
woman with coppery hair piled 
around the merest sketch or sug- 
gestion of a hat was leaning into 
the room with her slender hand 
on the doorknob. George caught 
a glimpse of someone standing 
behind her, and then, smiling 
brilliantly, she was advancing 
toward them like a minor natural 
catastrophe. 

"There you all are,” she said 
happily. “Hiding! Did you think 
I wasn’t coming, Luther? Art, 
when did you get into town? Why 
didn’t you call me? Morey, you’re 
looking as eatable as ever. 
George, darling,” she finished, 
and patted him on the cheek. 

The four of them were stand- 
ing, even Luther, who normally 
made getting out of a chair a 
ceremony. George found his heart 
going at an unusual rate. 
Glancing at the others, he con- 
jectured that they all felt the 
same symptoms as far as the 
state of their arteries would per- 
mit. Luther and Art were beam- 
ing, and Morey’s grin was a little 
more shy than usual. Hilda Place 
affected men like that — all men, 
as far as George bad been able to 
discover. 



She had enormous brilliant 
eyes, with faint bluish shadows 
under them, the eyes of a mature 
and knowing woman; but her lips 
had the softness of youth. Her 
slender body was covered from 
throat to wrist and calf by her 
dark green dress. Hilda preferred 
not to expose herself in public; 
she had never worn the showcase 
gowns that were currently fash- 
ionable. 

Accepting their greetings, she 
gave each of them a kiss on the 
cheek. All except George. While 
he was still telling himself that it 
was absurd for this to matter so 
much to him, she had turned and 
brought a stranger into the group. 

“I want you all to meet Joseph 
Krueger,” she said gaily. “He’s 
the most fascinating man in the 
world, and I want everybody to 
remember that I discovered him. 
Gentlemen, this is the Man From 
the Past!” 

The Man From the Past' 
looked as young as George; he 
was well set up, but had a curi- 
ous awkwardness about him, a 
coltish uncertainty. He had a 
large, chin, mild eyes behind 
dark-rimmed spectacles, and an 
engaging smile. George, despite a 
stab of jealousy, decided that he 
liked him. 

“I’m not a time traveler or 
anything,” Krueger was saying. 
“That’s only Miss Place’s exag- 
geration. I’m an amnesiac, they

tell me. I found myself standing 
on a street corner in Vienna two 
weeks ago, and the last thing I 
remember before that was having 
a drink in Wichita, Kansas, in 
December, 1953. So I’m amusing- 
ly ignorant, as Miss Place puts 
it." 

"Astonishing,” said Levinson. 
“Isn’t it?” said Hilda delight- 
edly. Her parted lips were moist. 
“This is all new to him. He 
drinks it in like a man from Mars 
— about the world government, 
and what happened to New York, 
and G-string parties — ” 

"And people hundreds of years 
eld," Krueger put in. “That, 
mostly.” 

Levinson was still pursuing his 
own thought. “You lived under 
amnesia for better than three 
centuries, then,” he said. "That 
must be a record. You have no 
idea what you were doing all that 
time, I suppose?” 

Krueger shock hi- head. ‘‘No, 
sir. I’ve made inquiries, of course, 
but there was nothing in my 
pockets that gave any clue, and 
apparently I didn’t live in Vi- 
enna; I couldn’t find anybody 
who knew me there. Actually, I 
don’t mind very much — I feel like 
what Miss Place calls me, the 
Man From the Past. I’m having 
a time just trying to catch up.” 
“We’ve been to see the Peace 
Monument, and Chico’s, and the 
Doges’ Palace — ”

“And the pretty girls on the 
Lido,” added Krueger, widening 
his grin. 

“ — and we’re still not half done. 
I’m exhausted,” Hilda said. “And 
I’ve got to disappear for a few 
weeks on business, so I hope some 
of you will find time to show Jo- 
seph the sights. Not you, Luther. 
I know you never go out. And, 
Art, I suppose you’re running 
back to your fruit-flies. But 
Morey? Or George?” 

Krueger looked uncomfortable. 
“I don’t want to be any bother.” 
“Not at all,” said George sym- 
pathetically. “You’re a novelty, 
you know, and that’s a rare thing 
after the first hundred years or 
so. Have you got any notion 
where you’d like to go next, or 
is it all too new?” 

“Too new. I’m afraid. But any 
place I haven’t seen yet would 
be fine with me, as long as I’m 
no trouble." 

“I’ll work out an itinerary and 
call you," said George. “Let me 
have your address and number." 

T UTHER said, “Meanwhile, 
^ shall we go mingle with the 
populace? I've got to, anyway. 
Some of them would probably 
recognise me if they saw me and 
will be hurt if they don’t." He crf- 
fered his arm to Hilda and they 
Started out. He turned at the door 
to ask Levinson, “You’re staying 
<he night at least, aren’t you. 



Art? Good. We’ll all get together 
again a little later.” 

George exchanged a few more 
words with Krueger, introduced 
him to three beautiful women, 
and wandered off looking for 
Hilda. 

He found her in the middle of 
a tight group near the end of the 
room where dancing was being 
attempted to the strains of Lu- 
ther’s music-library outlet, and 
wormed his way in to her. 

“Dance with me?” he asked 
hopefully. 

“Of course, George,” she said, 
and a reluctant lane opiened for 
them. Then her lithe warm body 
was in his arms, and the ridicu- 
lous gilded feathers on her hat 
were tickling his ear. 

“I rather like your Joe," he 
said. 

“I’m glad. Isn’t he delicious?” 
Her breath warmed the side of 
his neck. 

“Haven’t kissed him," said 
George. “I’ll have to take your 
word for it.” 

Somehow, without seeming to 
withdraw deliberately, she no 
longer was quite so close to him. 

“Sorry, ” he said.“That slipped." 

“I didn’t like it," she told him, 
“but I think I’ll forgive you, be- 
cause I like you so much. Actu- 
ally, though, you’re wrong. Jo- 
seph is one man I’m absolutely 
certain I shall never have an af- 
fair with.”

"That’s not much comfort,” 
George said grumpily. “It seems 
to make two of us — Joseph and 
me.” 

She smiled up at him. “As if it 
matters, darling. There are so 
many women in the world.” 
“But it’s you I want.” 

"For the moment.” 

H e stared in astonishment at 
her softly laughing eyes. 
“Well, good Lord, you don’t think 
it should be forever, do you? I 
mean monogamy was all very 
well for a short-lived human race, 
but — ” 

“Don’t be silly, George. No- 
body could stand one mate for 
what may be centuries or even 
more. It’s a horrifying thought.” 
“Then what are you trying to 
tell me?” he challenged. 

“I’m very fond of you; you 
know that. And I’m very pleased 
and flattered that you want me.” 
“Then why not — ” 

She seemed almost embar- 
rassed. “I don’t know just how 
to put it, darling. If it’s just me 
you want, when there are so 
many other women, then it’s an 
obsession and you ought to see 
an analyst.” 

“But I said it wasn’t that 
Really, Hilda, this is all very 
damaging to my self-esteem. I’m 
not sure I want to know your ob- 
jection to me, but I’m afraid I 
must. What is it?” 



She turned still pinker and 
looked away. “It’s idiotic,; 
George. You probably won’t un- 
derstand it; I don’t think I do, 
myself.” She turned her face up 
defiantly. “I feel — motherly to- 
ward you.” 

'‘Motherly?" he repeated, stun- 
ned. “But that’s nonsense! You 
wouldn’t know how a mother 
feels! None of us would — I mean 
women, of course — any more 
than I know what it’s like to feel ■ 
fatherly.” 

“But I’m so much older than 
you.” 

“Well, who isn’t?” 

“You see, I said you wouldn’t 
understand,” she answered sadly, 
then tugged his arm with sudden 
desperate gaiety toward the bar. 
“Let’s forget all this sociological 
argument, George. I want a 
drink.” 

So did he, George realized. 



S UNLIGHT, divided by the , 
prism high in the arched ceil- 
ing, struck full on the paintings 
that lined either side of the long, 
curving gallery, and left the cen- 
ter, the moving strip with its 
divans, its cafe tables and chairs, , 
in a soft, restful gloom. , 

“Here we come around again,” • 
said George. “Another of the

empty glass. “Yes, but this 
round’s mine. You’ve been pay- 
ing for everything.” 

“That will complicate things, 
though,” objected George. “Tell 
you what. You can buy our tick- 
ets to the shadow plays tonight.” 

As they approached the check- 
er in his little booth, George took 
the green disk with the tab that 
said TOM COLLINS and the orange 
and white one that said scotch/ 
SODA and stuck them into the clip 
on the table’s center pole. 

Around the center pole were 
four illuminated plastic cylinders 
which reeled off the names of the 
paintings as they passed. Pi- 
CASSO, they were saying, mask 
AND bones, oil ON CANVAS, 2073 . 
TSCHELETCHEW, FLIGHT FORMS 
# 6 , INK AND CRAYON, 2105 . 
SHAHN, INCUBATORS, OIL ON CAN- 
VAS. 

“I’d like to see more of his,” 
said Joe, looking at the Shahn. 
“His stuff seems more vital than 
most, somehow. More — ” He 
hunted for a word, gave it up 
with his usual embarrassed shrug. 

“He’s younger,” said George. 
“Picasso, Tscheletchew and all 
that bunch were old men when 
the longevity treatment came in. 
They’re still turning out the same 
thing, pretty much, that they 
were doing three centuries ago. 
It does get tiresome, I admit, but 
who’s interested in art when there 
are other things to do and see? 



We’ve gone a long way in more 
important directions, if you ask 
me.” 

“Oh, yes,” said Joe emphati- 
cally. 

“Besides, the Culture Commis- 

TfT 

sioner tells them what to turn 
out. Works fine for everybody.” 

The serving station came 
around. The white-jacketed wait- 
er stepped neatly aboard, smiled, 
deposited their drinks, and step- 
ped off again. The cylinders an- 
nounced, RENOIR, BAIGNEUSE, OIL 
ON CANVAS, 1888 . 

George stirred his drink mood- 
ily. Joe was now watching the 
paintings attentively,' and he felt 
free to let his thoughts wander. 
After Hilda had gone home last 
night — not with George, worse 
luck ! — the four of them had 
gathered in the study again for 
a council of war. This time it had 
been Morey Stiles who had led 
the discussion. He had pointed 
out that the project couldn’t pos- 
sibly be managed on a small 
scale, that in spite of the danger 
they had to have an organiza- 
tion. He was right, of course; 
after all, they’d need an enor- 
mous staff who would have to 
know what was going on, not to 
mention the several thousands of 
women who would have to be 
persuaded to give birth. 

Luther, warming to the prob- 
lem, had been all for secret meet- 
ings in basements, and an clab-

orate organization based on the 
ancient Communist system. He 
had been voted down. The plan, 
as they finally evolved it, cen- 
tered around doctors — specialists 
in women’s complaints, for pref- 
erence — who were to be recruited 
and sworn in by Levinson. It 
would be their job to test their 
patients for fertility, carefully 
sound out the pick of the lot, and 
recruit them in turn. Meanwhile 
Morey, as the team’s best ad- 
• ministrator, would be drawing up 
plans' for the birth centers, in- 
specting locations, bribing offi- 
cials, and so on. Luther, who had 
the widest acquaintance among 
monied men, would scout for 
more capital. 

There had seemed to be noth- 
ing left for George to do but to 
pony up when required and to 
keep his mouth shut. Levinson 
had told him, however, that there 
would ultimately have to be a 
somewhat risky attempt to reach 
the public, and George, because 
of his youth and daring, would 
be very valuable in that phase 
of the conspiracy. When? Levin- 
son didn’t know. 

And Hilda, who had only just 
got into town, was off again to 
some mysterious destination for 
an unspecified length of time. 

Anyhow, he had Joe to feel su- 
perior to; he ought to be grate- 
ful for that. He felt mildly 
ashamed of, himself when he 



glanced at the man and saw the 
eagerness in his face. Perhaps 
that was the answer to the ques- 
tion of ennui, he thought — get 
yourself knocked on the head, or 
have your memories surgically 
excised somehow, and start all 
over again. 

That wasn’t such a foolish idea 
as it might seem, he told himself. 
After all, nobody knew yet what 
real longevity was like; nobody 
was older than three or four cen- 
turies. What would happen when 
they were all three thousand or 
more? 

There was plenty of time to 
worry about it, at least. 

He said, “I’m sorry, I wasn’t 
listening.” 

Joe repeated, *T’ve been read- 
ing histories like mad, but I can’t 
seem to take it all in. Things are 
so much the same, in some ways, 
and yet so different.” He shook 
his head. “I suppose I’m trying 
to get it too fast.” 

“Well, there isn’t exactly any 
rush,” said George cheerfully. 
“Anything in particular bother- 
ing you?” 

“No children, chiefly, I guess. 
It’s hard for me to understand 
how that could possibly be en- 
forced. In my day, population 
was always increasing to meet 
the available food supply; it was 
supposed to be some kind of 
natural law. And now you’ve 
stopped it cold.”

“Had to,” said George. “You 
■ee, the fellows who perfected the 
longevity techniques published 
their work, and the newspapers 
took it up, and the thing got com- 
pletely out of control in the next 
fifty years. Normal birth rate — 
higher, as a matter of fact — and 
the death rate way down. That 
was the time of the big blowup 
— famines, riots, and the Last 
War on top of it. When we came 
out of that, we had three things: 
longevity, a strong world govern- 
ment, and a greatly improved 
birth control technique. Those 
pills, you know, that everybody 
has to take. 

“Well, what else was there to 
do? They had to cut down the 
birth rate, at least, or in a century 
or so we would have been stand- 
ing on each other’s shoulders. 
And that would have been un- 
enforceable, you know — re- 
stricted breeding. You can’t tell 
anybody that he’s not as fit as 
the next man to have children. 
So they stopped it altogether, 
made childbirth a capital crime. 
As a result, the total population 
has shrunk a good deal in the 
last three hundred years, but 
we’re still over what’s regarded 
as the optimum figure. Or so they 
say.” 

“How do you mean?” 

“Well, restricted breeding is an 
awfully hot potato. We’ll have to 
come to it eventually, but I don’t 



think anybody in the government 
is happy about the prospect. If 
we started reproducing in any 
quantity, the whole economic 
balance would be upset. Tre- 
mendously complicated problem. 

I don’t know enough about it to 
explain to you properly.” 

“I should think it would be 
particularly hard on the women,” 
said Joe thoughtfully. 

“Well, there were a lot of peo- 
ple, men and women both, who 
couldn’t adjust to longevity it-’ 
self, let alone the other problems. 
In the first century after the war, 

I understand suicide accounted 
for something like fifteen per 
cent of the death rate. Looking 
at it from one angle, that was a 
good thing for the race. I mean 
to say, if a person has any fun- 
damental instability, it’s going to 
come out in two centuries or less. 
And people for whom there 
simply wasn’t any room in the 
society. Without children con- 
suming and not producing, you 
know, our production rate is 
enormously higher. There was a 
lot of unemployment, too, in that 
first century. Some starvation. 
I’m afraid. And crime waves. But 
that’s all settled down now, and 
as you see we have a very stable 
setup, and a high living standard. 
That’s why it’s going to be so 
difficult to change when we have 
to.” 

“Umm,” said Joe, seriously. 



It 



GALAXY SCIENCE MCTION 



It occurred to George that he 
had been talking rather seriously 
himself, not exactly the best line 
to take for a man with knowledge 
be was supposed to conceal. He 
smiled cheerfully and said, “But 
I don’t think anybody should 
work up an ulcer over it just yet. 
You can generally lick a problem 
if you have a few thousand years 
to mull it over.” 

Joe nodded enthusiastically. 
"That’s one of the things that 
awes me, whenever I think about 
it. In the old days — I mean, in 
my day — ” He shook his head. “I 
keep getting my terms of refer- 
ence mixed up. Anyhow, it used 
to be that a man could learn 
enough to do what he wanted 
to do by the time he was thirty, 
end then his life was half done. 
Now—” He looked baffled. “It’s 
hard to take in. Tell me. Miss 
Place said something about rock- 
et flights to the stars — ?” 

“Oh, yes. They got to the 
Moon in 1954. That must have 
been a year or two after you 
blanked out. Mars is 1961, I 
think it was, and Venus the year 
after. Moons of Jupiter in 1969. 
All uninhabitable, of course.” 
“Yes, but I meant interstellar 
flights?” 

*■ TUST one. Alpha Centauri, 
along about the turn of the 
century. The trip took something 
like six years each way, I under- 



stand. They found a very Earth- 
like planet, and I believe there’s 
some talk of putting a small col- 
ony there.” 

“Lord!” said Joe Krueger. “But 
—all this time, and they haven’t 
done anything more about it?” 

“Well, it’s really a hobbyist’s 
kind of thing,” said George 
thoughtfully. “A good many peo- 
ple, with more time and more 
capital to play with, have turned 
to space-flight who wouldn’t have 
been much involved with it be- 
fore. But it hasn’t any economic 
base, you see. No really urgent 
reason for anyone to tackle it.” 

“That’s what I don’t get,” said 
Joe, creasing his brow into an an- 
xious frown. “Wouldn’t it solve 
the problem we were just talking 
about?” 

“It might, at that,” said 
George, trying valiantly to see 
the question from the other man’s 
viewpoint. “But it hasn’t come to 
that yet, and probably won’t for 
a good long time. As things stand, 
human life is a very precious 
thing, much more than it was 
even in the Western countries in 
your day. That’s understandable, 
isn’t it? It’s like betting at rou- 
lette — if you haven’t got much to 
lose, you may as well risk it all; 
but if you’ve got a lot, you’re a 
fool to gamble it away. So that’s 
one reason we don’t have war— • 
another argument against breed- 
ing that I forgot to mention — and

we play a good deal of tennis 
and squash and so on, but no 
football : and we’re not anxious to 
risk our necks on exploring ex- 
peditions. You had something in 
mind like the colonization of the 
Amazon basin and so on, didn’t 
you?” 

Joe nodded. “All habitable 
areas.” 

“Not the same thing, though 
—we have no population pres- 
sure, no economic pressure. Things 
are good here for everybody. Why 
should anybody want to leave? 
There’s more room in the Amer- 
icas, but I like Europe and who 
needs more room just for him- 
self?” 

Joe grinned wryly. “I see it — 
in theory, anyhow. But I’m 
damned if I feel that way about 
it. Me, I’d like to go.” 

“I’ll see if I can wangle an in- 
troduction to Clarke, the Rocket 
Society high lama. Luther knows 
him, I think.” 

Joe was saying, “That would 
be wonderful,” when George’s 
wrist phone buzzed. He said, 
“Excuse me,” and swiveled the 
disk into his palm so that the re- 
ceiver covered his ear and the 
transmitter pickup touched his 
throat, making eavesdropping 
impossible. 

“George Miller,” he said. 

“George, this is Art Levinson," 
said the tiny voice rapidly. “I’m 
about to be arrested by the Se- 



curity Police. I tried to reach the 
others, but they’re both out of 
phone range.” 

“The Security — that’s impos- 
sible,” George protested. “We 
haven’t done a thing. They 
couldn’t know!” 

“I told you I sp>oke to Van 
Dam, the Public Health Com- 
missioner,” said the voice impa- 
tiently. “He must have figured 
I’d do something about the ster- 
ility situation, so he evidently 
had my rooms wired and put a 
detail of police on my trail. 
Everything we said in our con- 
ference must be on official tapes." 

“Good God!” George ex- 
claimed. “Then we’re all in 
danger!” 

“Of course. Don’t tell me you 
haven’t got anybody trailing 
you.” 

George glanced around appre- 
hensively. Everybody suddenly 
looked suspicious, but there was 
no one he could specifically iden- 
tify as a Security Policeman. 

“I don’t know,” he said. 
“Where are you?” 

“In Luther’s bedroom. I locked 
myself in. They’re trying to break 
the door down. Good-by, George. 
Just pass the word along. That’s 
all you can — ” 

“Hold on! How long can you 
keep them out of there?” 

“Another few minutes, if that. 
Don’t try to do anything foolish, 
George. There’s another of thens 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



in a ’copter outside the bedroom 
window. Just tell — ” 

“Wait!” said George excitedly. 
“Hold them off as long as you 
can. Throw a fit. Do anything.” 
He broke the contact and said to 
Joe’s astonished face, “Something 
urgent. Pay the check for me, 
will you? I’ll call you later.” 

He fumbled a bill out of his 
wallet, stood up and leaped off 
the moving strip, dashing past 
indignant patrons of the arts to 
the roof exit. 

Thoughts blurred in his head. 
He didn’t know what he could 
do, but he intended to do some- 
thing. He couldn’t let Levinson 
stand off the police by himself. 
The excitement was somehpw 
pleasant — the adrenalin squirting 
through his veins, his chest fill- 
ing massively with air^ his shoul- 
ders knotting with the expecta- 
tion of a fight. It was astonishing. 
He couldn’t think of anyone who 
wouldn’t avoid danger at abso- 
lutely any cost; with his condi- 
tioning, it was hard to believe 
that he was being so foolhardy. 

Yet George felt rather proud 
of himself. He’d wondered why 
Levinson had included him in the 
original tiny group of conspira- 
tors, had resignedly assumed it 
was actually because of his 
money. Now he knew at least 
part of the reason and respected 
Levinson’s shrewdness. 

He was, he thought quickly, 



about two minutes away from 
Luther’s apartment by air — if he 
could get a cab. 

The roof was crowded with 
private ’copters, and for a mo- 
ment George debated the idea of 
stealing one. Impossible. They 
were all stowed in parking clips, 
and he couldn’t get one out past 
the attendant anyhow, even if 
some fool had left his keys in the 
dashboard console. He ran on, 
reaching the cab section just in 
time to see a red-and-green ’cop- 
ter lifting away. He thought it 
was empty, but he couldn’t be 
sure. 

He shouted futilely, then 
swung his wrist-radio out, dialed 
it to "Directional” and sighted 
carefully at the rising ’copter. 
After a long moment the instru- 
ment clicked and said, “Signor?” 
The cab steadied and hovered. 

“Down here,” said George. 
“Where you just came from — the 
Modem Museum.” Apparently 
he had lost the contact, for the 
’copter hung annoyingly' where 
it was. Then he could see the tiny 
dot that was the driver’s head. 
He waved madly, and in a mo- 
ment the cab settled back to the 
landing stage. 

George piled in and said, “Get 
up — quick.” As the ’copter lifted 
again, the driver’s mustachioed 
face turned to regard him quizzi- 
cally. He said, “The Penaldo 
Building on the Rio S. Polo. You

know the place I mean?” 

“Surely, signor.” 

“Then hurry, will you?” 
George waved a hundred-lira 
note, on second thought added 
another. The ‘driver’s eyebrows 
went up the merest trifle; philo- 
sophically, he headed the ma- 
chine into the northbound traffic 
level and fed power to the rotors. 

George looked anxiously at his 
phone. He didn’t have Art’s call 
number, worse luck. But if they 
had already broken down the 
door when he got there, he’d 
know soon enough. He forced 
himself to relax, then exploded 
into motion the next instant as 
the cab settled on the Penaldo 
Building’s roof. He thrust the 
money at the driver, shouted, 
“Good work, thanks!” and ran 
across the roof to the canal -side 
parapet. 

He looked back once to make 
sure that the cab had taken off, 
then peered cautiously over the 
parapet. There was the police 
'copter, sure enough, hovering 
outside the window of Luther’s 
top -floor bedroom. Underneath, 
five stories down, a white gondola 
was rocking in the surge of a 
small power boat. The gondolier’s 
ancient automatic curses drifted 
faintly up to him. 

Now what? He had had a 
vague notion that if he could 
eliminate the ’copter somehow, he 
could get Art out through the 



window before the other Security 
men broke in. But eliminating the 
’copter looked tough now, if not 
impossible. 

He risked another look. There 
was only one man in the ’copter; 
that was a point in his favor, 
though he wasn’t sure how. But 
just to begin with, he couldn’t 
attract the man’s attention by 
shouting; he’d never be heard 
over the noise of the ’copters 
rotors. And he couldn’t very well 
show himself. As for the phone — 

IVait a minute! The police 
would almost certainly be talk- 
ing to each other by phone; in 
fact, he was positive of it. And 
these small transmitters didn’t re- 
produce intonations very well. It 
could work. Anyway — 

George aimed the phone care- 
fully at the man in the ’copter 
and said briskly, “On the roof I 
Quick!” Then he ducked out of 
the man’s visual range and 
watched the rotor blades. When 
they began to rise, he leaped 
away from the parapet and got 
behind the stairway entrance. 

The door was open, and George 
could hear muffled banging 
sounds down the corridor. Good 
for Art, he thought abstractedly; 
he must have piled furniture 
against the door. 

He looked around the corner 
of the entrance and saw the ’cop- 
ter’s tail level with the parapet. 
Instantly he faced the other way.

.put his palm against the door 
frame and shoved himself vio- 
lently backward. 

He toppled out into view, legs 
going furiously to try to keep, his 
balance; then he let himself go 
and landed with a bone-crushing 
thump on the hard roof. He 
scrambled to his feet again, drew 
an imaginary knife from his 
jacket, and lunged back behind 
the entrance. 

There was a* thump as the 
'copter landed on the roof, and 
then footsteps pounded toward 
him. George ducked around the 
opposite side of the entrance and 
ran silently, on the balls of his 
feet, completely around to the 
blind side again. 

The policeman, a depressingly 
burly young man in pearl-gray 
jacket and shorts, was leaning 
half into the doorway, listening 
to the sounds from down the 
hall. Without hesitation, George 
launched himself at his back. 

They tottered a moment. Then 
the policeman’s grip was torn 
away and they plunged together 
down the stairs. They landed 
with a jar that shook George 
from skull to knees. He sorted 
himself out and saw that the 
young policeman was also getting 
up, with a dazed expression on 
his face. George hit him on the 
point of the jaw, as hard as he 
could. The policeman collapsed 
and slid down another four steps. 



Panting, George slid down be- 
side him and took his gun. He 
could still hear the pounding 
down the hall. Evidently the 
others hadn’t heard the crash 
when they ca?|ie down the stairs, 
though it had sounded loud 
enough to wake a regiment. 

George hit thj; recumbent po- 
liceman thoughtfully behind the 
ear with the butt of his gun. He 
would have liked to get him out 
of the way, but strongly doubted 
his own ability to lug that steak- 
fed hulk any distance. He went 
back up the stairs, past the idling 
'copter, to the parapet again. 

It was a good fifteen feet down 
to the window and no way to get 
there. He couldn’t take the ’cop- 
ter down and simply invite Art 
to climb in; the rotor blades 
wouldn’t have enough clearance. 

Swearing to himself, George 
ran back to the ’copter and rum- 
maged inside it. In a locker just 
forward of the door, he found a 
rope ladder. But it took him what 
seemed like five anguished min- 
utes to locate the hooks — diabol- 
ically hidden over the door in- 
side the cab — which were de- 
signed to support it. 

He climbed in and took the 
'copter up, past the parapet and 
over, dangerously close, letting 
the ladder dangle against the 
window. For another agonizing 
interval, nothing happened. 
George was about to haul the 



aa 



WORLD WITHOUT CHILDREN 



ladder up again and tie a wrench 
to it, when the window suddenly 
swung open and Art’s red, wild- 
eyed face appeared. 

George leaned out and gestured 
wildly. Art noddad, grasped th« 
ladder, and swung precariously 
out into space. 

George hovered carefully until 
Art was halfway in. Then he took 
the ’copter up and away in a 
wild swoop that nearly made Art 
fall out again. 

Art closed the door and jack- 
knifed himself into the tiny space 
to right of the pilot’s seat. When 
he got his breath back, he said, 
"Thanks.’* 

"Don’t mention it," ‘ said 
George. “Did they want you very 
badly, Art?” 

“Afraid so. Didn’t give them 
a chance to tell me. Ducked into 
the bedroom and locked the door 
when I saw them." He took a 
deep breath and smiled. “Where 
to now?” 

George felt an unexpected glow 
of satisfaction. Imagine anyone 
asking him what to do next! 

"I’m looking for an empty 
landing stage," he said. "We’ll 
ditch llie ’copter there, and then 
get ourselves as thoroughly lost 
as we can." 

Ill 

ri^HEY left the ’copter on the 
roof of a theater building and 
■topped at tha nearest publin 



phone booth to try to reach Lu- 
ther and Morey. Both were still 
out of range. Then they went 
looking for a suitable hiding 
place for Art. 

In Venice — in any modern city 
—there were a million places to 
get very thoroughly lost. There 
were discreet apartment houses, 
residence hotels, ’copter courts— 
and there were the vice houses, 
George, knowing Art’s staid hab- 
its, chose one of the latter. The 
police would also know Art and 
might not look there. 

For the benefit of those with 
scruples or reputations, entrance 
to the house was by way of a 
series of little cubicles lining one 
side of an arcade. The other side 
was rented to a group of second- 
rate but bona fide shops. Having 
inspected the merchandise dis- 
played there and assured himself 
that no acquaintances were lurk- 
ing in the corridor, a prospective 
client could simply step across 
into the nearest vacant cubicle 
and shut the door. Inside, a polite 
voice from a wall speaker asked 
to be allowed to learn your 
wishes, registered you under any 
name you chose to give, and al- 
lotted you a room, a suite, a wing 
or a floor according to your 
wishes and your pocketbook. 

George, speaking German with 
a thick and slightly drunken 
Munschener accent, affected hesi- 
tation and asked for a resume of 



U 



• Al-AXT SCIENCE FICTION 



the house’s attractions. The invis- 
ible clerk immediately switched 
to impeccable Low German and 
suggested, “The Herren would 
possibly like to inspect -the ladies 
in one of the private salons be- 
fore making a choice? Or per- 
haps one of the theaters first? Or 
if the Herren require any stimu- 
lation — ?” He proceeded to de- 
scribe some of the entertainments 
now being offered in the theaters, 
and to name the various species 
of stimulants that were available 
to clients. 

“No,” said George fuzzily. 
“Later, later. We are already too 
drunk. Give us just a room — ^no, 
a suite. The best.” 

“Certainly. Sixty lira, please.” 
George put the notes into the slot 
in the counter. A receipt and two 
door keys popped out, and the 
right wall of the cubicle rolled 
back to reveal a tiny self-service 
elevator. “Suite C 35,” said the 
clerk. “Turn right when you 
leave the elevator.” 

The suite was eminently com- 
fortable: three bedrooms, two 
baths, living room, game room, 
and even a tiny gymnasium; but 
Art grumbled. “Dammit, George, 

I suppose I shouldn’t complain 
when you’ve just saved my neck, 
but I can’t see your sense of 
humor. Anyway, what are these 
people going to think when I-keep 
staying here but don’t have any 
women up?” 



t "Probably think we’re queer,” 
George suggested. Then, as Art 
seemed about to explode, he 
added hastily. “It’ll be good for 
you. Art — teach you humility 
and not condemning your fellow 
man and so forth. Anyhow, 
you’ve got to admit it’s safe.” 
“All right,” said Art, brushing 
the subject aside. “Listen, do you 
have any idea where Luther and 
Morey might be, or when they’re 
due back?” 

“Not the faintest,” George ad- 
mitted. “Luther has his cat farm 
up near Turino — he might have 
gone there — but he might just as 
easily have run over to Praha or 
even Wembley for a couple of 
days. Morey might have gone 
back to North America — I hope 
so— but in any case I don’t see 
how we can risk a ’gram without 
giving the whole show away.” , 
“No,” agreed Art. He scowled 
and bit his lip. “Just the same, 
we’ve got to locate them. I have 
a hunch the S. P. is just as anx- 
ious to find them as we are.” 
George lifted one eyebrow. 
“You think they’re clairvoyant?” 
“No. I think that up till an 
hour ago, Golightly’s crowd took 
me just seriously enough to want 
me out of the way. But since 
you’ve pulled that television- 
serial act with the ’copter. I’m 
willing to bet that they’re seri- 
ously alarmed. I told you they 
must have our meeting on tape.

so they’ll know Luther and 
Morey are involved. You, too, of 
course.” 

George sat down on the edge 
of a large, circular divan, uphol- 
stered in aphrodisia red. He said 
thoughtfully, “Well, what do we 
do? If we all run, then we’ll just 
be advertising our whereabouts, 
won’t we?” 

Art nodded grimly._“But if the 
S. P. gets hold of any of the four 
of us, I wouldn’t give much for 
our chances of seeing daylight 
again.” 

George stared at him. “I sup- 
pose I’m naive, but it seems to 
me that you’re implying they’ll 
use illegal methods — truth serum 
and so on.” 

“I think they will,” Art said 
positively. “George, you were 
born into this socjety, so I 
wouldn’t expect you to realize, 
emotionally, just how unstable it 
really is. You’ve read about the 
series of religious wars that fol- 
lowed the big blowup, and the 
Asian massacres, but I suppose 
it’s never occurred to you that 
that kind of thing could happen 
again. It could, and nobody 
knows it' better than Golightly. 
By education and technology 
and, let’s' face it, by the execu- 
tion of everybody who really 
objected, this planet has been 
forced to keep its birth-rate at 
zero. But the urge to reproduce,' 
next to the survival instinct, is 



one of the strongest forces in na- 
ture. Tilt the balance of control 
just enough, and Golightly’s gov- 
ernment would go over like a 
house of cards. And just inci- 
dentally, Golightly is about as 
paranoid as you can get without 
being locked up. I know the man. 
He’ll do anything to keep himself 
in the driver’s seat.” 

George felt himself going a 
trifle pale. He said, “In that case, 
I suppose I’d better get busy. 
I’ll call every place they could 
possibly be. You stay here. Art. 
I’ll come back and report as soon 
as I can.” 

He found a public booth in the 
concourse nearby, and spent an 
expensive twenty minutes trying 
to locate Morey at his headquar- 
ters in Des Moines, and Luther at 
Turino, Praha, Wembley and 
points in between. 

Gloomily, he called Art at the 
vice house, using the name he 
had given in registering. “No luck 
so far,” he said in German. “See 
here, have you looked at the fax 
or the video newscasts?” 

“Yes. Nothing of interest 
there.” 

“Do you think they may have 
been found already?” 

“It’s possible,” said Art’s earn- 
est voice, “but I think it’s un- 
likely. Anyone like those two is 
terribly hard to track down at a 
moment’s notice, as you are find- 
ing out. If we can get them! 



WORLD WITHOUT CHILDREN

within the next few hours, 1 think 
we’ll be in time. Keep trying.” 

. , George rang off and sat think- 
ing for a moment. Actually, the 
possible number of places where 
either Luther or Morey might be 
at this moment included every- 
* thing within a day’s flight from 
Venice, meaning the major part of 
Earth’s surface. If he kept on 
calling relay stations at random, 
it might easily take him days to 
hit the right one. There had to be 
a quicker way. 

How about the agony columns 
In the Telefax papers? George 
considered the probable cost 
briefly, and whistled softly to 
himself. Another difficulty was 
that it would mean showing his 
hand; the S. P. would almost cer- 
tainly see the messages, whether 
Luther and Morey did or not. But 
he could think of no other an- 
Bwer. 

He plucked a doodle-sheet 
from the pad fixed to the wall of 
the booth, and set down a rough 
draft of the message. Dissatisfied, 
he scratched it out and tried 
•gain. After six attempts, he had: 

WORLD FATHERS OF VER- 
MONT AND LOUISIANA: Seri- 
ous charges have been leveled 
against revered Father Owl of 
California. Abandon your worldly 
identities immediately and ily to 
consult with your brethren. The 
meeting will assemble in the place 
•f the Drowned Insect. 

It sounded silly enough, he 



hoped, to pass as an ordinary no- 
tice intended for one of the innu- 
merable crackpot sects which had 
sprung up after the power of the 
organized churches had been 
crushed. He couldn’t make it 
more sp>ecific, but he hoped “Ver- 
mont and Louisiana” would serve 
to attract Luther’s and Morey’s 
attention — the name of a man’s 
home state will usually stand out 
from a page of type almost as 
well as his own name — and 
“World Fathers” and “Father 
Owl of California” would^make 
the identification certain. 

The last line was a long shot. 
He had to indicate a meeting 
place without naming it; “the^ 
place of the Drowned Insect” 
was a restaurant in yenice where 
the three of them, a few years 
before, hadjaeen served a tureen 
of soup with a dead cockroach 
floating in the center of it. Also, 
he had to tell them to assume 
false names, and if possible get 
across the idea that they were to 
disguise themselves. Here dgain, 
he couldn’t be too explicit; 
“abandon your worldly identi- 
ties” was the best he could think 
of. 

When he read it over, it seemed 
like a forlorn hope either that the 
two men would see the notice or 
that they would read it correctly. 
But he took the slidewalk down 
to the nearest fax agency and 
fed the message into a machine. 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



adding the code numbers for all 
the local papers served by the 
Mediterranean Agency, which 
covered southern and eastern 
Europe, part of what had once 
been the Soviet Union and most 
of North Africa. 

The cost was approximately 
two hundred times the amount of 
cash he was carrying, and this 
worried him until he reflected 
that he was undoubtedly on the 
S. P. list, if Art was right; there 
was no point in trying to conceal 
his tracks. He wrote a check and 
fed it into the machine. 

While he waited for its ac- 
knowledgment, he set up the same 
message on another machine and 
coded it for the PanAmericati 
Syndicate. He went through the 
same procedure twice more, once 
for the North Atlantic Agency 
and once for tire All-Asia Syndi- 
cate. 

When he was finished, his Ve- 
netian bank account was in a 
state of near collapse. 

The bank itself was only a few 
blocks away, near the Rialto 
bridge. As an afterthought, he 
went there and closed out his ac- 
count, pocketing the cash. It had 
occurred to him that, again sup- 
posing that Art was right, the 
government would very likely 
impound their property. He 
wished he had included a sug- 
gestion of this kind in the mes- 
sage to Luther and Morey, but 



it was too late to worry about it. 

He went back to the vice hoUse, 
conferred with Art, and then took 
himself to “the Place of the 
Drowned Insect.” 

The restaurant was an old- 
fashioned one, catering to those 
who liked human service well 
enough to pay the almost astro- 
nomical prices imposed by the 
waiters’ salaries. At that, George 
noticed, the place was under- 
staffed. In another century or so, 
he supposed, nobody would be 
able to hire any kind of servant 
for less than a division chief’s 
pay. 

He found an inconspicuous 
table at the rear, ordered mine- 
strone and spaghetti marinara, 
and waited. When the spaghetti 
gave out, he ordered a half bottle 
of claret. He made the wine last 
as long as he could, then bought 
a newspaper at the fax machine 
across the room and ordered an- 
other half-bottle. 

He checked to make sure his 
ad had been eptered properly, 
read the paper through, and then, 
through sheer boredom, read it 
completely through again. He 
was beginning to feel awash with 
wine, and the waiter was glanc- 
ing at him with obvious irrita- 
tion each time he passed. George 
caught his eye and ordered a pas- 
try and coffee. When that was 
gone, he ordered more coffee. 
Then he went back to wine.

Eventually it became impossi- 
ble to think of taking another sip 
of the stuff. George sat and stared 
glassily at the half-empty bottle, 
wondering why he had not had 
the God-given sense to make the 
meeting place a library, or an 
opium den, or anything at all ex- 
cept a restaurant. 

“Came as soon as I could,” said 
Luther’s voice. “What’s up?’’ 
George looked around with 
enormous relief to see the little 
man easing into the chair oppo- 
site. 

“Luther!” he said. “I couldn’t 
be gladder to see you!” He smoth- 
ered a belch. “You haven’t gone 
back »to your apartment, have 
you?” 

“No, of course not. Why?” 
“Don’t. According to Art, we're 
•11 about two jumps away from 
jail. Where were you, and how 
did you come back?” 

“In Milano. I wanted to see a 
man there who claimed he had a 
new strain of Abyssinians. Came 
back by plane, the same way 1 
went up. IVhyF” 

“Good Lord,” said George. 
•Tfou were lucky they didn’t nab 
you at the airport. All right, the 
next thing is, give me checks for 
■ny funds you’ve got in Venetian 
banks. Wait a minute. First, do 
you have any idea where Morey 
might be?” 

“Marseilles, I think. Now 
why—”. 



George stood up somewhat un- 
steadily. “I’ll try to call him 
there while you’re writing the 
checks. Don’t order anything till 
I get back.” 

He returned in a moment. “No 
luck. Either he’s on the way back, 
or you were mistaken. Got the 
checks?” 

“Yes. Here. But listen, George, 
take pity on my ignorance, will 
you? What’s happened to Art? 
Why do you want all my money? 
I feel as if I’d come in at the 
second act.” 

“I’ll explain it all to you later 
or Art will. Oh, damn!” He looked 
at his watch. “The banks are 
closed, aren’t they?” He tore up 
the three slips of paper Luther 
had handed him and stuffed the 
fragments in his pocket. "Well, 
look. Art is in the Hotel Scato on 
the Nuza Vecchia, Suite C 35. 
Speak German and ask for Herr 
Bauernfeind — that’s the name I 
gave when I registered. You go on 
up there as fast as you can, but 
use the slidewalks; don’t take a 
'copter. I’ll stay here — ” George 
looked unhappily at the wine bot- 
tle — “and wait till Morey shows 
up, or the place closes.” 

Luther stood up. “All right. 
Look, though, if Morey is on the 
way here, and if he started about 
when I did, he might be within 
phone range by now. Why don’t 
you try calling him again?” 

George clutched at the idea. "I 



M

win. Waft for me.” He went to the 
booth again and dialed Morey’s 
number. 

A voice said, “This is Stiles.” 
George sighed happily. He said, 
“George, Morey. How long will 
it take you to get here? ... You 
saw the ad? . Good. I’ll meet 
you outside.” 

A N hour later they were all to- 
gether in Art’s suite, listening 
to a video newscaster announce, 
“The following persons are want- 
ed by the Security Police for 
questioning in connection with a 
conspiracy against the peace. 
Please memorize these names and 
pictures. If you see one of these 
persons, communicate immedi- 
ately with your local S. P. office. 
Arthur Benjamin Levinson, age 
341 : residence, Pasadena, Cali- 
fornia; profession, geneticist. Lu- 
ther Wallace Wheatley, age 357 ; 
residences in Venice, Mexico City 
and Caulfield, Vermont; inde- 
pendently wealthy.” Three more 
pictures and descriptions of Lu- 
ther’s friends appeared, then 
George’s. Morey was far down 
the list, which was a long one. 

“They’ll narrow it down,” said 
Art Levinson. “In a couple of 
days, at the most, they’ll have 
located all but the four of us. 
Then you’ll really see a fox hunt.” 
Morey’s long face was gloomy. 
“It don’t look good. Art. If you 
want my opinion, we’re licked.” 



“I didn’t say the fox hunt 
would succeed,” Levinson said. 
“We can slip the hounds and, as 
long as we’re free, we have a 
chance to get our program 
across.” 

Morey shook his head. “Maybe 
you got some reason to be opti- 
mistic, but I don’t see it. We’ve 
got to throw* out all the plans 
we’ve made so far, ain’t that 
right?” 

“Yes.” 

“Well, then, will you tell me 
what in blazes we can do? How 
much money have we got be- 
tween us?” 

They counted up. George had 
a little over two thousand inter- 
national credits. Art four hun- 
dred, Luther not quite a thou- 
sand, and Morey, surprisingly, 
five thousand. 

“It’s union money,” he said 
glumly. “If we spend it, that’s 
one more crime chalked up 
against us. Not that it’ll matter. 
Anyhow, we got just short of 
eighty-three hundred credits. 
How far can we get with that?” 

“Not very far — if we run,” said 
Art. “If we run, they’ll catch us. 
I think we can take that as a 
mathematical certainty. That dis- 
poses of one of the three alterna- 
tives we have, as I see it.” 

“The other two being?” asked 
Luther. 

“We can give ourselves up,” 
said Art. “Or we can fight. It may

seem funnj% but I. honestly think 
the safest thing we can do — sup- 
posing for a minute that we’re 
just interested in saving our necks 
— - — is to fight. Or let’s say to re- 

sist. The other two ways are the 
next thing to suicide.” 

Art’s round face was flushed 
with enthusiasm. Luther was 
smiling quietly, and there was a 
faint gleam even in Morey’s pale 
eye. George felt a trifle left out. 
He had an absurd picture of the 
four of them behind a barricade, 
doing battle with an endless 
swarm of policemen. 

“Somebody explain this to me, 
will you?” he asked plaintively. 

“He’s too young to remember,” 
said Luther kindly. “Tell the boy. 
Art.” 

Art leaned forward earnestly, 
and unconsciously the three 
hitched themselves forward a lit- 
tle in their chairs. 

“George, you probably haven’t 
read much about the two so- 
called ‘World Wars’ that pre- 
ceded the Last War, because in 
historical perspective they were 
only a sort of preliminary. But 
during the second one, when Ger- 
many had overrun most of Eu- 
rope, there was a thing called the 
Resistance. An underground 
movement. Their situation was 
very much like ours — they didn’t 
have enough of an organization 
to attack openly, or even defend 
themselves openly. But they did 



what they could — sabotage, espi- 
onage, propaganda, and some 
guerrilla warfare. In effect, they 
made themselves one hell of a 
nuisance to the Germans. We can 
do the same thing.” 

“There were more than four of 
them, though, weren’t there?” 
George asked. 

Art said, “An analogy is just 
an analogy, George, not an iden- 
tity. As it happens, Golightly’s 
government has one serious dis- 
advantage that the Germans 
didn’t have. The Germans were 
a frankly oppressive group to be- 
gin with, operating to the full ex- 
tent of their power. Golightly’s 
crowd can't fight even a small 
resistance group — and we’ll grow, 
don’t worry — without assuming 
the characteristics of a tyranny. 
And, George, this planet simply 
isn’t weak enough or sick enough, 
economically and politically, to 
hold still for a tyrant. 

"This present group has been 
continuously in power for more 
than two centuries, and there isn’t 
one of the inner circle that 
wouldn’t like to extend their 
power. But we’ve still got a de- 
mocracy. Why? Because they 
haven’t got a power concept be- 
hind them. They’ve kept office 
all this time because they’re the 
best administrators and practical 
politicians on the planet, and 
that's a//. If they stop acting in 
the people’s interest — which 



92 



OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



they’ve already done — and if 
enough of the people find out 
about it — which they will — ^their 
goose is cooked.” 

“This is revolution you’re talk- 
in’ about,” said Morey gently. “A 
lot of people’re going to get hurt.” 
“I know it,” replied Art, look- 
ing grimly unhappy. “Show me 
another way, Morey, and I’ll 
grab it.” 

“This is just for the record, so 
to speak,” Morey said. “There’s 
an election coming up in eight- 
een months. We might be able to 
hook up with Golightly’s opposi- 
tion and get them in.” 

Luther snorted. “Di Falco? 
That man is the eternal disap- 
pointed candidate.” 

“And,” said Art, “we can’t wait 
eighteen months. All right?” 
“Grant the point,” agreed Mo- 
rey reluctantly. 

“Okay. _Here’s a tentative list 
of tactics I’ve made up. You’ll 
notice that I’ve tried to put the 
emphasis on things that will pro- 
voke the government into illegal 
and, if possible, violent acts. It’s 
like ju-jitsu — ^we’ve got to make 
them use their own strength 
against themselves.” 

“Let’s see that,” said Morey, 
with such enthusiasm that the 
other three stared at him. “It’s 
been a long time since a union 
man had to hit below the belt, 
but I remember a few tricks, can 
dig up more from the old books. 



and maybe invent some of my 
own.” 

IV 

1 1 iHERE was an underworld, of 
course; no society, however 
perfect, had completely rehabili- 
tated or absorbed the maladjust- 
ed who had either too much 
power drive or not enough, the 
bitter rebels and the passively de- 
feated, those who wouldn’t con- 
form and those who couldn’t. In 
ethical societies, the underworld 
had consisted of criminal and po- 
litical malcontents, while harsh 
tsrrannies had suppressed the 
honest. 

George had been vaguely aware 
of the underworld, but he had 
never, as far as he knew, encoun- 
tered any of its denizens. Now, 
g;uided by Morey and Levinson, 
who had maintained cautious 
contact with it, he found that he 
had unsuspectingly been quite 
friendly with a number of peo- 
ple on the Security Police’s gray 
list. 

The strange thing was that he 
had always previously considered 
these daring semi-criminals the 
worst bores he knew. 

There was ■ the 'Thanatopsis 
Club, for instance. Levinson had 
arranged to have George address 
them in secret session, and George

eral times, skittered through al-

leys while looking fearfully over 
his shoulder — and ended in a dis- 
mal suburban house belonging to 
Elbert Maxwell, the ornithologist. 

It was a very tense gathering 
in the living room. Carlotta Spe- 
ranza was there, a small unattrac- 
tive bibliographer with a sharp 
and peering face, who could talk 
your ear off about ancient litera- 
ture; Kurt Lustgarten, the phi- 
losopher, whose flabbily intense 
features had backed George into 
more corners at parties than he 
liked to remember; Paavo Atter- 
berg, the musicologist, whom 
George had been more successful 
at evading, generally because At- 
terberg could be easily, maneu- 
vered to a piano; and other simi- 
larly intense people, with eager, 
hungry eyes and nervous hands, 
who were unfamiliar to George. 

Elbert Maxwell saw him look 
puzzledly at the TV screen, which 
was writhing with some frantic 
dance in full color, and the pair 
of drinks each person was holding 
grimly, and the flimsy costumes 
they wore. 

“Camouflage,” Maxwell ex- 
plained, giving a shrill, anxious 
laugh. “If the police raid us — 
which has happened a couple of 
times; we’re all suspected of dan- 
gerous cultural activities, you 
know — why, we’re simply having 
an innocent vice party.” 

“I see,” said George, confused. 
“When do I speak? I have sev- 



eral more addresses to make to- 
night.” 

Maxwell glanced at a card he 
was holding. “Well, we’ll try to 
move you up on the agenda, but 
I’m afraid you picked a bad 
night — there’s a great deal of 
business to be done at this meet- 
ing.” 

George took the two antagonis- 
tic drinks that were handed him 
and sat down to listen patiently 
until his turn came. He was aware 
of his own tension. He was pretty 
sure he’d thrown off any possible 
shadows, but he couldn’t know 
whether the others present had 
been as clever. They certainly 
didn’t look it. At any moment, 
the house might be stormed and 
this pathetic attempt to make a 
criminal underground meeting 
seem like a mere orgy wouldn’t 
fool the police. 

Maxwell, pretending to watch 
the TV screen, told the gathering 
that two more species of bird had 
become extinct in the last decade, 
and at least six others were in 
danger, with the government, as 
usual, threatening any attempt to 
save them. The listeners showed 
every emotion from horror to 
rage. George tried to feel upset 
about the situation, but couldn’t. 
It wasn’t that he disliked birds; 
he just thought it was their prob- 
lem, not his. Maxwell’s motion to 
set up secret bird sanctuaries was 
carried, and George felt an emo-

— at the amount of money they 
agreed to raise for the project. 

Carlotta Speranza, talking pas- 
sionately about the decline of 
literature, didn’t bother pretend- 
ing to watch the TV show. She 



“You can’t do this to me!” 
Carlotta shrieked. “Are your

“Then put your program aside 
temporarily.” 

Maxwell was shocked. “And 
let these species vanish forever?” 
“I think both should be consid- 
ered by all our colleagues in the 
underworld.” said Atterberg, “but 
the main thing is raising money 
to save music.” And he tried to 
go into an excited explanation of 
the musical crisis, but Maxwell

made him wait until his speech 
was scheduled. 

Lustgarten spoke next. George 
tried manfully to listen to his 
statement on problems of philos- 
ophy in an indifferent world, but 
developed a headache that had 
to be massaged by a drink. One 
proved insufficient; he took the 
other and opposite drink, which 
acted like an explosive charge to 
the primer of the first one. He 
was silently rooting for one team 
of jet-skaters on TV by the time 
Lustgarten and Atterberg finished 
and it was his turn to talk. 

George managed somehow to 
explain the problem. The others 
listened attentively until it was 
time to take a vote. Then a split 
developed. Lustgarten and At- 
terberg declared that they were 
personally not involved; they 
didn’t care much if humanity 
survived unless, as Atterberg put 
it. there was music in its soul, or 
philosophy and not brainless fri- 
volity, in Lustgarten’s words. A 
very tall woman with almost no 
hair on her head, quite a bit on 
her face and military shoulders 
stated that she would rather die 
than submit to breeding. 

Maxwell was in favor, as long 
as the project did not interfere 
with saving birdlife. When Car- 
lotta Speranza unexpectedly 
dropped her own program to sup- 
port George’s, and said, "Birds 
don’t create literature, Elbert; 



people do, and we must keep the 
race going to that end,” Maxwell 
suddenly changed his mind. 

"If I have to choose between 
birds and humanity,” he said bit- 
terly, “I’ll take birds every time. 
They never exterminated another 
race of animals! Whereas, what 
has been humanity’s record? One 
species after another wiped off 
the planet! Because of vicious- 
ness? Greed? At one time, yes — 
the bison and the egret are two 
examples. But the motive today 
is pure lack of interest. We en- 
croached on the habitats of our 
furred and feathered friends until 
they could no longer maintain ex- 
istence, and so went into the 
limbo of extinct species.” 

"Wouldn’t happen again,” 
George argued fuzzily, realizing 
that he was neither articulate nor 
sober enough to overcome Max- 
well’s notorious literary style. 
"Everybody dies. New generation 
takes place. Not enough people 
to cover Earth. Birds multiply. 
Animals multiply. Educate new 
generation to take care of ’em. 
Teach ’em music and philosophy 
and literature — everything. Solves 
all problems same time.” 

“In how many centuries will 
the present population die off?” 
Maxwell demanded. "What hap- 
pens to animal life in that time? 
Wiped out, sir — wiped out com- 
pletely! No, I’ll let humanity die 
out before I’ll allow another spe-

cies ever to become extinct!” 
”But voting against the birth 
program won’t hasten the end of 
mankind,” Carlotta Speranza 
pointed out heatedly. “It will still 
take the same number of cen- 
turies before we all die.” 

“Abs’lutely right,” George 
agreed. 

It didn’t change the vote, how- 
ever. George acquired Carlotta 
and two other women and one 
man who looked singularly unfer- 
tile as members of the conspiracy. 

He was told how to get to his 
next appointment, given a few 
more drinks for the road, and, 
though he remembered only a 
blurrily earnest facq or two in in- 
distinctly different living rooms, 
he had nearly two dozen signed 
applications to turn over to Lev- 
inson in the morning. 

“You’ve done fine, George,” 
Levinson said enthusiastically, 
while George shakily placed a 
hangover capsule on his fuzz- 
covered tongue. “The organiza- 
tion is under way!” 

“It’s awfully hard on the ear- 
drums and the bladder,” George 
complained. “Right now, I don’t 
feel that saving humanity is 
worth the trouble.” 

“You’ll learn not to listen,” 
said Morey encouragingly. “Even 
to yourself, as a matter of fact. I 
know — I can make any number 
of union speeches without even 



hearing myself. Habit.” 

“And all the drinking I have to 
do?” George asked, pulling down 
his lower eyelids to see the en- 
gorged veins more clearly. 

“It’s free, isn’t it? And you can 
carry alcohol-neutralizing tablets 
with you.” 

George turned around in hor- 
ror. “Then where’s the fun?” 

V 

G EORGE’S beard itched. He 
had had it for almost a 
month now, but it didn’t appear 
that he was ever going to get 
used to it. Or to the wax Art Lev- 
inson had injected under the skin 
at the bridge of his nose, to give 
him a new profile. He kept com- 
pulsively scratching the area and 
it seemed to have set up some 
kind of local irritation. He had a 
plastiskin bandage over it now, 
which increased the hump and 
made the disguise better, though 
still more annoying, but at least 
it kept his fingernails away. Af- 
ter this weekend, when he’d meet 
the other three in Seville to com- 
pare notes, he’d have it attended 
to; meanwhile, there was nothing 
to do but bear it. There were 
doctors in Paris to whom it would 
be safe to go, but George didn’t 
know them; that was Levinson’s 
department. They had decided to 
work apart as much as possible.

so that the capture of one might 
hinder their activities, but 
wouldn’t stop them altogether. 

At the moment, ironically 
enough, both the itches, as well 
as the skin dye and new hair- 
line, were entirely unnecessary. 
George, mingling as usual with 
the largest crowd he could find 
anywhere, was attending the an- 
nual Beaux Arts Ball as one of 
approximately three Jhundred 
robed, tinted and masked pseudo- 
African witch doctors — ^this cos- 
tume being, for no discoverable 
reason, the season’s favorite. 

Aside from the itches, he was 
enjoying himself thoroughly. He 
danced with all the prettiest 
women, who, according to imme- 
morial custom, concealed about 
as much of themselves as the 
male guests left uncovered. He 
flirted with them, kissed them if 
they seemed amenable, and, 
whenever a fold of bustle or head- 
dress gave him the opportunity, 
concealed leaflets <>n their per- 
sons. 

It was a safe method: most of 
the pamphlets probably would 
not be found until the costumes 
were removed. And although he 
observed that more of the ladies 
than he had counted on were dis- 
pensing with concealment at the 
ball itself, he was further pro- 
tected by his costume and his 
excellent French. In case of ex- 
treme emergency, he had thought- 



fully provided himself with a 
skin-tight Lucifer suit under the 
witch-doctor’s robes. 

Temporarily without a part- 
ner, George made his way 
through the press of bodies to a 
pillar, where he steadied himself 
long enough to look at his watch. 
It was getting on toward the un- 
masking hour. He looked around, 
over the heads of the crowd, to 
make sure he knew where the 
nearest side exit was. He was ex- 
pecting something of a rumpus 
when it came time to unmask; 
there might be arrests. 

A masked man in S. P. uni- 
form went by, closely clasped by 
a sumptuous dark girl at least a 
foot taller than himself. There 
were a good many S. P. costumes 
in the hall, and George suspected 
that the greater part of them were 
genuine. 

He turned, and his elbow sank 
into something soft and warm. 
He heard a stifled ‘‘Ahr and saw 
that he had knocked the wind out 
of a young woman with aston- 
ishingly large eyes and an even 
more surprising bosom. He apol- 
ogized, profusely. 

“Large pig," she shouted in his 
ear. “I forgive you. Embrace me." 

He did so, and felt her hands 
passing inquisitively over his 
flanks and chest, under the robe. 
She murmured, “Mmm," and 
kissed him a little harder. 

He broke away gently, feeling 



M 



OAIAXV SCIENCE EICTION 



that reconciliation had gone as 
far as it respectably could. She 
gave him an impish smile and 
disappeared into the crowd. 

George put two fingers cau- 
tiously under his robe and dis- 
covered a tiny oblong of folded 
paper. He opened it and saw the 
familiar headline: naissance OU 
mort! It was a copy of his own 
leaflet, printed on the same sort 
of home copier he used himself. 

He put it away with the rest 
of his supply. The movement he 
had started was growing won- 
derfully well. 

He went around the periphery 
of the crowd in the opposite di- 
rection to the one the girl had 
taken. Just ahead of him, near 
the bar, he saw a slender woman 
jostled by a passing man in a 
frog suit. Her glass slipped out 
of her fingers, and the liquor 
spread a dark stain over her flow- 
ing taffeta skirt. 

George whipped out his hand- 
kerchief and moved forward to 
help. Then he paused. The wom- 
an’s hair was coppery and abun- 
dant, and the mouth below her 
half-mask was of a particular 
perfection he had seen only once 
in his life. Hilda. 

Caution told him to avoid her, 
but he had to be sure. He moved 
forward again, knelt beside her 
and dabbed at the stained skirt. 

“Thank you so much,” she said 
In French, "but I’m afraid it’s 



a hopeless mess now.* 

It was her voice: George felt 
the customary tingling down his 
backbone. He had not seen Hilda 
since the night Art arrived in 
Venice, and had not hoped to see 
her for a long time to come. But 
it wasn’t safe to let her recognize 
him. He stood up, bowed, and 
turned away without speaking. 

She caught suddenly at his 
arm, turned him around again. 
"George!” she said. “It is you. 
Where have you been hiding? 
I’ve looked everywhere. And 
Luther and Morey . • What is 
all this nonsense?” 

George felt a little relieved, in 
spite of himself. Of course, she 
would know him from his youth 
alone, just as he knew her by 
her mouth. He said, "Hello, 
Hilda. I’ve missed you.” 

"George.” She put her lips close 
to his ear. "You won’t hide from 
me any more, will you? We’ve got 
such a lot to tell each other — ” 

A shattering blare of trumpets 
from the center of the room in- 
terrupted her. A much-amplified 
voice cried, "Mesdames et mes- 
sieurs, the hour of unmasking is 
at hand. Choose your partners!” 
The babel of voices, which had 
subsided for a moment, rose, 
again. George glanced, at his. 
watch, then, at the rafters high, 
above. He . could just make out a 
tiny grayiblue, dot there, hang-- 
ing among the clustered lanterns.^ 



WORLD WITHOUT CHILDREN

It was time, this minute, this 
second — 

A new voice blared out, not as 
loud as the first, but clear and 
sharp. “Citizens of the world!” it 
cried. “The future of mankind is 
in your hands! The government 
tells you that there is no danger 
— that the human race is not be- 
coming sterile. The government 
lies! Find out the truth for your- 
self! Go to your doctor, have him 
examine you. Only one in ten is 
now capable of having children. 
If you are that lucky one, do not 
throw away your priceless heri- 
tage. Have children! Now, before 
it is too late!’* 

Men were running toward the 




GALAXY SCiENCK FICTION 



center of the room; George heard 
shouts and a few screams. The 
voice — George’s own, recorded 
through a filter to make it un- 
recognizable — went on: “If the 
government is telling the truth, 
why is it afraid of open debate? 
Why are your newspapers cen- 
sored? Why are you yourselves 
subject to illegal arrest and im- 
prisonment without trial? Why — ” 
A flat explosion drowned the 
voice, then another. There was a 
new outburst of feminine screams, 
and a sudden violent movement 
away from the center. The S. P.s, 
George guessed, were shooting at 
the playback mechanism he had 
bribed a workman to set up 



among the lanterns. It was tim« 
to get away. 

His recorded voice went on, but 
another drowned it out. “No one 
is to leave! Unmask, everyone, 
and stand where you are!” 

The movement away from the 
center continued. In the press, 
Hilda was clinging to his arm, 
shouting something at him. He 
broke away and dived into the 
crowd, heading for the side exit 
he had spotted before. 

He was a little too late. The 
crowd was in full motion now, as 
irresistible as a charging herd 
of cattle. Ahead of him, he saw 
an S. P. man vainly struggling 
to turn and halt those behind. He

■aw the flash of a revolver; then 
someone clubbed the man in the 
neck and he went down under the 
feet of the crowd. 

George had a sudden, terrified 
thought: What it that should 
happen to Hilda? But he was 
caught in the tide of bodies: it 
was useless even to think of turn- 
ing back. 

The wide doors of the main en- 
trance had been thrown open, but 
there was still a bottleneck. The 
pressure grew until George 
thought his ribs would crack; 
then he was out and running 
desperately to keep from being 
trampled. 

An S. P. car was pulled up at 
the opposite curb and, as he 
watched, another joined it. S. P.s 
tumbled out, tried to form a line. 
The crowd overwhelmed them. 
There were shouts of “A has les 
flics!” and roars of laughter scat- 
tered among the screams. 

The crowd’s temper was chang- 
ing from fear to defiance. There 
would be broken windows and 
broken heads in Paris tonight. 

George’s devil costume was 
now as dangerous as the witch 
doctor robes ; anybody in carnival 
dress who was unlucky enough 
to meet a policeman would be 
arrested. He stopped in an alley 
to strip them both off — he wore 
a singlet and shorts underneath 
»— and then put the noise of the 



rioting behind him before he 
crossed the Seine to his hotel. 

On the sidewalk in front of 
the hotel a huge N/M! was 
chalked — the symbol of the Com- 
mittee Against Human Extinc- 
tion, N/M in French and Span- 
ish, G/T in German, B/D in • 
English: Birth or Death! They 
had begun it themselves, flying 
from city to city, one to a con- 
tinent: the people had taken it 
up. 

He thought again of Hilda, and 
looked at his wrist phone. They 
no longer used the personal 
phones to communicate among 
themselves, since it was possible 
that the S. P. was monitoring all 
such calls; but it would do no 
harm to call Hilda, especially if 
he kept the contact short. He 
pressed the buttons that coded 
her number. 

“Yes?” said her warm voice. 
“This is Hilda Place.” 

“It’s Geor.ge,” he told her. “Are 
you all right?” 

“George, where are you? I must 
see you. Joe is here with me. Tell 
me where you arc and we’ll dash 
over.” 

“It wouldn’t do,” said George 
regretfully. “I only wanted to 
know if you got out all right.” 

“Yes, George, of course. But — ” 

“Good night, Hilda,” he said, 
and broke the connection. 

It was almost time for the 



42 



6ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



hourly newscast, but George sat 
for a few moments staring at the 
dead vision set, thinking about 
Hilda. Then he began thinking 
about himself and Hilda, which 
was more complicated. 

He hardly knew what it was 
he felt about Hilda, except that 
he wanted her. He knew that 
there was no basis for a settled 
relationship between them, but 
his mind rebelled at the knowl- 
edge. 

Well, if they succeeded in this, 
things would be different. Every- 
body would have to revise his 
view of life. The family would 
revive; religion with it, probably. 
The changes would go deep into 
the social structure, as Art and 
Luther said: affecting manners, 
morals, ultimately every depart- 
ment of human life. 

Not all at once, of course. For 
one thing, fewer than one person 
in ten would manage to become a 
parent before reaching the sterile 
age; and not all of those would 
be able, or want, to equate par- 
enthood with marriage. 

George’s own part in the new 
world was still hazy to him. He 
tried valiantly once more to see 
himself happily married to Hilda, 
and once more failed. The pic- 
ture was simply wrong, in every 
way. He didn’t have the conjugal 
temperament, and neither, he was 
sure, did Hilda. What was going 
to become of them, who had been 



bom into this childless world of 
cautious carelessness and sag« 
superficiality, and knew no other? 

That was rather good, George 
told himself. He was surprised 
and pleased; his wit was ordi- 
narily of the evanescent variety, 
not worth using more than once. 
When he wrote his memoirs — 

There was a knock on the door. 

“Entrez” said George, and the 
door, keyed to his voice, swung 
open. Two S. P. men stood there. 
They did not hesitate, but strode 
rapidly toward him. 

With an effort, George relaxed 
his tensed muscles and looked 
at the advancing officers with 
what he hoped was the right mix- 
ture of alarm and indignation. 

“What is it? What’s the mat- 
ter?” he demanded. 

The taller officer had a sheaf 
of photographs in his hand. He 
riffled them rapidly, selected one, 
and looked keenly from it to 
George’s face several times. He 
said something in an undertone 
to the other man. 

The short, stocky one drew his 
gua and stepped aside. “I shall 
have to request you to come with 
us, monsieur. A formality only^ 
If yqu are innocent, you will be 
freed.** 

“But what *is the charge?” 
asked George. 

“You are wanted for question- 
ing i.i connection with the riot at 
the Beaux Arts Ball, monsieur.** 



WORLD WITHOUT CHIIDRIN 



“I wasn’t even there!” George 
protested. 

The officer shrugged. “That 
may be, monsieur. It is believed 
that the instigator of the riot is 
not a native of Paris. Therefore, 
we are investigating all guests of 
hotels. Those whose appearances 
are similar to those on these pho- 
tographs are to be brought in for 
questioning. You are not under 
formal arrest, monsieur, unless 
you insist.” 

George felt a hollowness at the 
pit of his stomach. Such an ob- 
vious move and they had not 
thought of it! He said, “Very 
well,” and moved toward the 
door. The tall officer grasped his 
arm, the other fell in behind 
them. 

At the doorway, George lunged 
forward. As the tall officer in- 
stinctively pulled back, George 
followed his motion, turning at 
the same time and putting the 
heel of his hand under the other 
man’s chin. He shoved, hard, and 
the officer went reeling back into 
the room. George slammed the 
door in their faces and ran. 

The elevator was not at this 
floor. He dived down the stair- 
case, took the first flight four 
steps at a time, and doubled back 
on the floor below to the other 
staircase. He guessed that the 
S. P.s had come by car; for a 
house-to-house search, it would 
be more efficient than ’copters. 



If he was right, he had a fair 
chance of hailing a cab and get- 
ting away before they found him. 

Back on his own floor, he 
peered cautiously around the cor- 
ner before emerging from the 
stairway. His room door was 
open, but there was no one in the 
corridor. He heard nothing. He 
darted out and up the ascending 
staircase. 

The roof was silent and de- 
serted under the stars, glowing 
at his feet in a wash of light from 
the tubes that outlined the roof. 
Traffic went by inaudibly, high 
overhead in the dark sky. 

He saw the yellow riding lights 
of an unoccupied cab, not di- 
rectly above, but bearing a little 
to one side. He took out his flash- 
light and blinked at it, trying 
hard to get the aim right; it was 
a long distance and a difficult 
angle. 

The ’copter did not turn. It 
kept its course and disappeared 
finally down toward the Eiffel 
Tower. 

He heard a sound down the 
stairwell. It was an ambiguous, 
uncomfortable sort of sound. He 
listened, but it was not repeated. 

He walked quietly behind the 
stair entrance and tried again. 
Another empty cab was ap- 
proaching, no nearer than the 
first. He aimed the flashlight tube 
at it, blinked it rapidly on and 
off. 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



« 



After a heart-stopping mo- 
ment, the cab turned toward him. 
And then he heard stealthy 
sounds in the stairwell. He 
listened. Footsteps, coming up. 

He glanced at the oncoming 
cab. Too late; too far away. He 
went quickly to the nearest para- 
p>et, and holding the tiny flash- 
light like a dagger, stabbed it at 
the glow tube. Glass tinkled and 
fell, and the light died along that 
edge of the roof. The corner was 
only a few steps away; he broke 
the next tube as well. Now the 
roof was lighted only on the two 
sides farthest from him, and the, 
stair entrance cast a long, deep 
shadow. 

He heard them step out onto 
the roof. They must have had a 
third man waiting in the car 
downstairs, George thought; 
when they learned that he had 
not appeared down there, they 
had turned back to search up- 
stairs. 

The cab had turned away, now 
that the signal had stopped and 
the edge-lights gone out. George 
watched its tiny lights dwindle. 

The footsteps came toward 
him, slowly, one pair on either 
side of the entrance. Two beams 
of light shot out, illuminating all 
the roof except the rear wall of 
the entranceway where he stood. 

"You had better surrender, 
monsieur,” said a voice. "Other- 
wise we are obliged to shoot.” 



George pressed himself thi« 
against the wall and tried to 
breathe quietly. The voice had 
come from the right; that was 
the spokesman, the stocky man 
with the gun. Therefore, he 
guessed, the other would step out 
first. He moved silently to the 
left, raised his arm and waited. 

The tall man stepped suddenly 
into view, swinging his flash 
around. George brought the edge 
of his palm down with all his 
strength, aiming for the man’s 
wrist, but hitting the flashlight 
instead. Pain rolled up his arm 
as the metal tube fell; then, 
blinded by the light that had 
shone in his eyes, he was strug- 
gling with the tall S. P. man. He 
struck out furiously, feeling a 
blow in return that numbed his 
side, and then the two of them 
toppled to the roof. 

George struck the other man 
once more, felt the grip loosen, 
and scrambled desperately to his 
feet. As he started to turn, a 
crushing pain struck him at the 
base of his skull. He saw the 
roof’s surface rising toward him, 
but felt nothing when it hit him. 

VI 

TTE was in a ’copter with a 
-*■•1- rope ladder dangling from it, 
hovering just over the bedroom 
window of Luther’s apartment. 
Art was inside, but he wouldn’t

climb out onto the ladder. George 
was about to pull the ladder up 
and tie a wrench to it when Art’s 
red, wild-eyed face appeared. 

Hurry, hurry! Art was climb- 
ing up the ladder, and now the 
window next door opened and a 
man was leaning out, with a gun 
in his hand. 

George was paralyzed with 
fear. He saw the man fire, and 
when he looked down, Art’s face 
was white and a thin spray of 
blood was whipping away from 
his body in the wind of the rotors. 

He’s hit, George thought. He’ll 
tall. 

George tilted the ’copter down- 
ward, toward the canal, but he 
was too late. Art fell, and the 
blue water of the canal turned 
red ... 

No, that was silly. All that was 
over and done with; they had 
come out of that all right. It was 
the Beaux Arts Ball that he had 
to worry about. His voice was 
bellowing out of the concealed 
playback machine, and everyone 
was turning to stare at him. He 
looked down, and saw that his 
witch-doctor’s robe was gone. He 
was standing there in the devil 
suit. 

All the others were shouting, 
“There he is! He’s the one!” 

He ran, but the crowd got in 
his way; he couldii’t move fast 
enough. And just behind him was 
the stocky man with the gun. He 



! couldn’t get away, death was be- 
I hind him, the gun-barrel rising, 
; the finger tightening on the trig- 
ger — 

Uih! 

He sat up, looking uncompre- 
i hendingly at the strange patterns 
L of light and shadow around him. 

His head hurt, and he couldn’t 
t raise his hands. Someone flashed 
1 a light in his eyes. Dazzled, he 
; said, “What — who are you? What 
■ are you doing?” 
t A voice said, “Bien.” Someone 
got up from beside his cot, and 
! two men, one in a white jacket, 
left the room. He could see them 
briefly in the light of the corridor 
: outside. Another man, in a 
: guard’s uniform, shut the barred 

1 door with a clang, and went 
away. 

; There was an interval long 
enough for him to come fully 
; awake, and discover that his 
wrists were manacled to the sides 
of the cot. Then two guards ap- 
peared at the door, unlocked it 
and entered. One of them re- 
moved the manacles and helped 
him to his feet. He tried to throw 
off the man’s arm, but found that 
he was too weak; too weak, in 
fact, to stand by himself. 

They led him along the corri- 
dor and into a small, brightly lit 
room where there was a heavy 
chair, bolted to the floor. They 
sat him iri it and strapped his 
wrists down.

A whitc-jacketed man at the 
side of the room was removing a 
hypodermic from a sterilizer. He 
turned, fitted the needle to the 
transparent shaft, depressed the 
plunger and thrust the needle 
through the covering membrane 
of a bottle. He stepped toward 
George. 

George gripped the arms of the 
chair, remembering what Art had 
told him about truth serums. 
“TheJ^’re not infallible. If you 
have a strong, balanced person- 
ality, and if you think up a good 
cover story and stick to it, truth 
serums won’t make you tell the 
truth. 

I was at the ball, he thought 
rapidly, but I had nothing to do 
with the plot. I haven’t seen Lu- 
ther, Art or Morey since that 
party at Luther’s. I don’t know 
where they are. I don’t know 
where they are. I ran from the 
police because I seduced a 
woman at the ball, and her boy- 
friend was angry with me. I was 
afraid he had made trouble lor 
me with the police. That’s not 
good, but it will have to do. 

He felt the coolness of evap- 
orating alcohol on his arm, then 
the cold stab of the needle. I was 
at the ball, he told himself, but 
I had nothing to do with the plot. 
I haven’t teen Luther, Art, or 
Morey ...or Luther, or Morey . 

He was beginning to feel 
drowsy. The words tripped over 



'each other in his head, became 
hopelessly jumbled. 

There was a timeless, drowsy 
interval; then he became aware 
that a hot rubber sheath was 
being removed from his arm. His 
body was stiff, and his hands and 
feet were numb. X 

He opened his eyes. The white- 
jacketed man was stuffing some- 
thing that clicked into an oblong 
box. He stowed the box away in 
a clip at the side of a massive in- 
strument board on wheels, and 
an attendant pushed it out of 
the room. 

The man looked at George, 
flexing the fingers of one hand in 
the palm of the other. “You gave 
us a hard time,” he said. “But 
you talked.” 

George kept his mouth shut, 
even when the guards came back, 
unstrapped \iim and returned him 
to his cell. 

Probably the man had been 
bluffing; they were hoping that 
he could be tricked into talking 
by making him believe that he 
already had. 

But early the next morning, he 
was transferred to another, a 
larger cell. In it were Luther, Art 
and Morey. 

Art said, “You knew where we 
were all going to be yesterday. 
If the truth drug didn’t get it out 
of you, all they had to do was 
put a lie detector on you and 
show you a map — point out one

47 



area after another until you re- 
sponded. It wasn’t your fault, 
George.” 

That was the way it had been 
done, all right, but the knowl- 
edge didn’t make him feel any 
better. He sat down on the empty 
cot, elbows on his knees. 



“I shouldn’t have got caught,** 
he said. 

“Could’ve happened to any of 
us,” Morey assured him. 

They were silent a while, and 
then George said, “Where are we, 
by the way?” 

“S. P. headquarters on the 




SAIAXY SCiEMCI FICTION 



Place de Concorde. They’ll move 
us to Berne for the trials, I sup- 
pose.” Art shrugged. ‘7f they de- 
cide to have any trials.” 

The day dragged by, then an- 
other and another. On the fourth 
day, they were told they were 
going to be moved in the after- 
noon, but nothing happened. 
They had no news of the outside 
world; they could only speculate 
how the movement was going 
without them. All four of them 
had been up for interrogation 
several times, and they were 
afraid that at least one of them 
had given up names and ad- 
dresses under the truth serum. 
There was no way of knowing. 
If the network they h^id care-, 
fully built up had been uncov- 
ered, there was no hope left. The 
conspiracy was too young to re- 
cover from such a blow. 

By tacit consent, they did not 
talk about anything they had 
done before their arrest. But Art, 
one afternoon, began speculating 
about the future. He spoke of it 
as if it were a foregone conclu- 
sion, as if they were as good as 
dead. 

He said, “It would be interest- 
ing to see it. After a few more 
centuries, I expect things will 
begin to go to pot in a small way. 
Things like new construction. 
The population’s steadily declin- 
ing, and you know there won’t 
be any new generations, so why 



build? And after that, why re- 
pair? A little later on. I’d guess 
that suicide would begin to be 
a factor again. When they begin 
to realize that if there is any 
point to the whole bloody busi- 
ness, the human race will never 
have a chance to find it out . 
Not much room for altruism any 
more. 

“We’re here, and we’re the last, 
and that’s all. After that, nothing 
but the big dark and the big cold. 
Besides, it isn’t going to be very 
pleasant later on, and people will 
begin to see that, too. There’s 
a bottom limit to the size of pop- 
ulation that can support an in- 
dustrial economy. They’ll pass it, 
going down. Then what? Back to 
the land? A mocked-up feudal 
system? • 

“But then the process will start 
to accelerate, I should think. 
Wars. Plagues. Natural catastro- 
phe®. Crop failures. Looters and 
bandits. Every man for himself. 
And at the end — ” 

He smiled bitterly. “None *of 
us would be alive to see that, 
anyhow. Women’s life-span is 
still longer than ours. It’ll end up 
as a world of women — women 
without men. Lord!” He shook 
his head. “That goes beyond my 
imagination. I can’t visualize it, 
and I don’t want to. The little 
that I can see scares me silly.” 

He looked at them as if he had 
forgotten they were there. 



WORLD WITHOUT CHILDREN 



49 



“Sorry,” he said. “I didn’t mean 
to turn this into a wake.” 

George thought a good deal 
about Golightly, and the rest of 
that stubborn, irrational, power- 
hungry crew. He found that he 
didn’t hate them, but it made him 
feel somehow betrayed to realize 
that these were the best rulers 
Earth had been able to produce. 
Good administrators, good prac- 
tical politicians, as Art had said 
— ^but little men, jealous of their 
position, fearful of new ideas. If 
that was the best the human race 
could do, perhaps it deserved 
what it was getting. 

He voiced something of this, 
and got the disagreement from 
Luther that he had hoped for. 
*‘We can do better, George. We 

have done better. In a normal 

• 

world, no matter how bad things 
get, at least they change. If we 
were bringing up a, flock of chil- 
dren now, one of them would Jbe 
a better candidate for World 
President than Golightly. But as 
it is, we’re stuck with just about 
three generations all told, and 
we have to make the best of 
it . .” His voice trailed off ; none 
of them wanted to pursue that 
thought. 

O N* the morning of the eighth 
day, guards came to take 
them away. 

George turned to Luther. “In 
case they separate us, and we 



don’t see each other again — ” 

Luther took his hand warmly. 
They gripped hands all around. 
There were tears in Art’s owlish 
eyes, and in Luther’s, and even a 
suspicious brightness in Morey’s. 
George found that his own vision 
was blurring a trifle. 

The guards led them down the 
corridor to an outer office with a 
long desk and a bench. They were 
told to sit down, and then a 
printed document and a pen was 
placed in front of each of them. 

George stared bewilderedly at 
his. It seemed to say: 

In return for due consideration, I 
hereby waive all claim for damages 
resulting from my mistaken arrest and 
detention by the Security Police, and 
further agree to waive my right of 
suit for false arrest against the Security 
Police and the United Nations of the 
World. In witness whereof I set my 
teal. 

He looked at the others, then 
at the guard who was standing on 
the other side of the table. 

“Sign,” said the guard, “and 
you’ll be released.” 

Art bent suddenly and began 
to scribble on his sheet. The 
others followed suit. Not daring 
to speak, they looked at each 
other as the signed papers were 
taken away. Then a guard led 
them off, each to a separate cu- 
bicle. In his, George found the 
clothes he had been wearing 
when he was arrested, and all the 
contents of his pockets neatly 



50 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



stacked. He put on the clothing, 
still dazed. The guard, not touch- 
ing him now, led him out through 
another outer office, through a 
lobby, where the other three 
Joined him, and then to the sun- 
light of the portico. 

The sounds of traffic came up 
to them; ’copters droned past in 
the sky over their heads; they 
heard a strain of music from 
somewhere down the great ave- 
nue. 

The guard reappeared and 
touched George’s elbow. “I was 
asked to give you this, monsieur,” 
he said, and put a slip of paper 
into George’s hand. Then he 
bowed and went back inside. 

George unfolded it slowly, read 
it twice. 

It said: 

Come and see me as soon as you can. 

Hilda 

There was an address below 
the signature. 

George passed the note to 
Morey, and the other two looked 
ever his shoulders. ^ 

“I don’t get it,” said George in- 
adequately. 

“No more do 1,” said Luther. 
•tBut — let’s go!” 

They found her on a terrace 
iDverlooking the Champs Elysees. 
Joe Krueger, grinning like a 
youngster, got up from the table 
and stood aside as they con- 
verged on Hilda. 



She smiled up at them. “I’m so 
glad,” she said. “Now kiss me 
nicely, each of you, and then sit 
down . You there, Luther, in 
the easy chair, then Morey, Art 
and George.” 

They said hello to Joe. They 
took the coffee cups Hilda passed 
around. And they stared at her. 

“Hilda,”, said Luther finally, 
“you consummate witch, what in 
the world did you do?” 

She smiled at them happily. 
“Well,” she said, “I managed to 
get to see Golightly. It wasn’t 
easy to do, even though I know 
his granddaughter quite well. I 
had to convince her *first, you see 
. No, you don’t see. You will, 
in a minute, though. I told him 
that he couldn’t stop people from 
having children by throwing you 
in jail. I told him that women 
had been breaking the birth pro- 
hibition for the last seventy years, 
to my own knowledge, and prob- 
ably longer. And I proved it to 
him — I showed him a doctor’s 
report that stated I had been a 
mother myself.” 

They stared at her. George felt 
as if the last prop of his own per- 
sonal universe had been knocked 
out from under him. 

“You, Hilda?” said Luther in- 
credulously. 

“Oh, yes.” She looked back at 
them, not smiling now, and laid 
her hand on Joe Krueger’s sleeve. 
“This is my son, gentlemen — my 



WORLD WITHOUT CHILDREN 



51 



youngest son. I have three." 
There was a shocked silence. 
Joe said, “She brought me up 
in a private estate in the Berk- 
shires, with some help from my 
brothers, but alone most of the 
time. She nursed me, took care 
of me when I was sick, and taught 
Tie everything she could. For 
wenty years . My twentieth 
■irthday was two months ago.” 
Luther said, “Hilda, do I un- 
lerstand that you began this ab- 
solutely alone?” 

She smiled, but it was a dif- 
ferent smile from the one they 
knew. Her face had changed 
subtly, George thought; there was 
a calm patience and wisdom in it 
that had never been there before 
— or that she had never allowed 
them to see. 

Her eyes softened, and she said, 
"I don’t blame you, darlings, be- 
cause you don’t know — you can’t . 
know. Poor things, you run the 
world, but you don’t understand 
■vhat keeps it going. 

"Anyhow, I told Golightly all 
-hat, and I presented a chemical 
analysis of Joe’s blood. He hasn’t 
had the longevity treatment yet, 
you know; that showed in the 
test. And then I gave him some 
statistics Joe had dug up. You’d 
better tell that part, Joe.” 

"I was curious to know whether 
the incidence of amnesia had 
gone up since the Last War,” 
said Joe. "I had an idea that 



other people besides Hilda had 
thought of that dodge. So I 
checked. It was up, way up. 
There was even an article about 
it in the North American Journal 
of Psychology, not so many years 
ago.” 

Art muttered something in an 
irritated voice. 

“Art?” said Hilda. 

“Nothing. I saw that article; 
I remember it now. It didn’t 
make any impression on me.” 

“Or on anybody, apparently," 
said Joe “ — luckily for us mem- 
bers of the younger generation.” 
He grinned. “Then I looked up 
some population figures and drew 
curves. You couldn’t prove any- 
thing that way, but it was sig- 
nificant if you knew the answer 
to begin with. After the War, the 
line went downward fairly sharp- 
ly for about the first century, and 
then it began to level off just a 
little more than anyone had ex- 
pected. At a rough guess, there 
are several hundred million peo- 
ple alive today who were born 
after the birth prohibition!” 

Inside the apartment, a fax 
machine chuckled to itself and 
then sounded a clear note. Lu- 
ther jumped, and George started 
to rise. 

Hilda said, “You get it, will 
you, Joe?” The young man — it 
was astonishing how young he 
seemed, now — smiled and went 
inside. He came out a moment 



52 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



later and handed the fax sheet to 
George. 

George read, “ ‘The birth pro- 
hibition has been rescinded, it 
was revealed at 10 A. m. Green- 
wich time today, by an extraor- 
dinary session of the Executive 
Council meeting in Berne. J*resi- 
dent Golightly released the fol- 
lowing statement: 

“ ‘ “It has been proved to my 
satisfaction, and to the satisfac- 
tion of the highest medical 
authorities, that a clear danger of 
total sterility of the human race 
exists. Under these circumstances, 
grave though the decision is, I 
have no possible alternative but 
to revoke all penalties against 
giving birth. 

“ ‘ “We stand today at the 
crossroads of human destiny. On 
one hand we see the total extinc- 
tion of our kind: on the other, a 
new and more glorious fulfilment. 
The centuries to come will be 
hard ones for some of us: 
they will bring many profound 
changes in our society, and many 
grave problems. But given the 
boundless courage of our people, 
and their unflinching determina- 
tion to succeed — ” ’ ” 

“Does he say anything else?” 
asked Art. 

“No. But here’s something 
about us. ‘Arthur Levinsion, 
M. D., George Miller, Morey 
Stiles and Luther Wheatley, ring- 
leaders of the so-called Commit- 



tee Against Human Extinction, ^ 
were released early this morning 
by the Paris division of the Se- 
curity Police. In a special state- 
ment, S. P. chief P-aul Krzewski 
characterized their activities as 
“sincere but premature,” and in- 
dicated that no charges would 
be pressed against any member 
of their organization.’ ” 

Morey lit a cigar. “That’s 

about as much thanks as we’ll 

ever get,” he said. 

“You weren’t finished, were 
you, Hilda?” Art asked. “I don’t 
quite see Golightly listening to 
reason, even with all that evi- 
dence.” 

“No,” she said. “All that first 
part was just the preliminary. 
Then I called in his granddaugh- 
ter — she was waiting outside. 

That was why I had to persuade 

her before I could do anything.” 

“I begin to see the light,” said 
Art softly. “She’s a mother, too.” 

“Of course. I’ve known it for 
years. As a matter of fact — this 
is rather funny, and something I 
didn’t know before — she told Go- 
lightly that his private secretary 
is her daughter.” 

Her face grew pinker. She 
leaned her forehead on her hand 
for a moment. Her shoulders were 
shaking. “You should have seen 
his face!” she said. 

They were all roaring with 
laughter, the tension in them dis- 
solving to leave them weak and 



WORLD WITHOUT CHILDREN 



5S 



wonderfully relieved. It was sev- 
eral moments before George 
glanced at Hilda and saw that 
Joe was standing over her in an 
attitude of concern, his hand on 
her shoulder. Her head was still 
bent into her palm. George 
realized abruptly that she was 
no longer laughing, but crying. 

He stood up and went around 
to her, feeling awkward. “Any- 
thing I can do?” he asked. 

Hilda dabbed at her eyes with 
a handkerchief and then looked 
up at them. “Just a touch of 
hysterics, I guess. I do feel like 
a fool. Only — I didn’t realize how 
scared I’d been.” 

George squeezed her shoulder 
and went back to his place. Joe 
left the table again to bring in a 
bottle of Chablis and glasses; 
there was a pleasant interval of 
tinkling and gurgling, and when 
it was over, Hilda was her usual 
self again. 

Luther raised his glass. “To 
Hilda.” 

“Hilda, my dear,” said Art 
slowly, “would you mind telling 
me why you did it? I hope I 
don’t sound ungrateful, but — it 
wasn’t just to save our lives?” 

Hilda hesitated a moment. 
-No, Art.” 

“I didn’t think so,” he said. 
"I’ve just now managed to pic- 
ture you as a mother, and in that 
light I can see you doing almost 
anything else for us four, obtuse 



as you must have thought us— 
;e but not risking a hair of young 
it Joe’s head.” 

n She smiled fondly at him. “I 
•n don’t really think you’re obtuse, 
11 Art. If I sounded that way, it was 
;e just feminist exaggeration. I sup- 
is pose you’re thinking now that all 
your trouble and danger were 
d for nothing, because we women 
f- have been breeding right along 
. but I don’t think that’s true. 
;h “I think that’s the difference, 
:d the really fundamental difference, 
}f between men and women. We 
:e women endure — we plug along, 
w doing the obvious things, keeping 
house and worrying about our 
:r men and bearing children and so 
>e on. And if we didn’t. Lord knows 
a what would become of us all. But

■n lem of children from the begin- 
al ning, and solved it on their own 
level. But not completely, not 
'o satisfactorily. You four discov- 
ered the same problem intellec- 
rt tually only a few months ago, 
ig and look what you’ve done!” 

I She made little fists on the 
it table for a moment. “I’ll confess 
that it was very hard for me to 
t. risk Joe. And I didn’t do it, fi- 
nally, because of my fondness for 
d. you four. If it had been only

son, Edwin, wants to be a doctor, 
wants it more than anything. 
He’s fifty years old now — ^that’s 
a long time to wait for the one 
thing you want most in the world. 
But there are no medical schools, 
only research seminars and a few 
brush-up courses. There’s no 
place in the world now like the 
one where Art got his earliest 
training.” 

“There will be,’’ promised Art. 
“Of course. And a million other 
things ... It isn’t particularly 
good for a child to be brought up 
in hiding, as Joe was.” 

“No one could have done it any 
better than you, Hilda,” said Joe. 

“Sweet,” she said; “but you 
all know I’m right.” 

“Of course you are,” agreed 
Luther. “In fact, you’re so right 
that I’m a little afraid of you. It 
was much nicer when I thought 
you were pretty much a feather- 
brain.” 

George said suddenly, “Joe, I 
never wangled you that introduc- 
tion I promised you, did I?” 
Joe’s eyes brightened. “To 
Clarke, the rocket man?” 
“That’s the one. Luther, can 
you arrange it?” 

“A pleasure. I didn’t know you 
were interested, Joe.” 

“Yes,” said Hilda, a little re- 
gretfully, “I wish he weren’t.” 

Joe looked uncomfortable. 
Morey spoke up unexpectedly: 
“You’ll have to face it, though. 



Hilda. This is one of the spheres 
where men take over.” 

“That’s right,” said Morey, 
“that’s where they’ll have to go, 
the overflow, the extra popula- 
tion that’s had us all trembling 
in our socks the last three cen- 
turies. To the stars.” He pushed 
his chair back and sat looking 
out over the sunlit street, and the 
’copters flashing in the sky. “That 
will make Golightly and me 
happy, at least, for the next few 
hundred years.” He smiled his 
unexpected, small-boy smile. 
“We can sit here and be as con- 
trary and stubborn as we want. 
But we’ll be just a backwater, 
Hilda. It’s your Joe that’s going 
to be the human race.” 

They drank to that, and after- 
ward George found himself alone 
with Hilda for a moment before 
they left. She kissed him gently: 
there were no tingles up his spine. 

He felt warmly fond of her, and 
somehow at F>eace with himself. 

The world was going to grow 
down to his size, he realized. He 
wouldn’t be The Child any more, 
not to everybody. In fact, the first 
colony on that far-off planet of 
Alpha Centauri might need a few 
older men around — men with a • 
few centuries of solid experience 
under their belts. Now there was 
an idea! 

Happily, he went down Into the 
long afternoon.

about scooped it full and 
most of the warmth had leaked 
from my fingers when I saw the 
thing. 

You know, at first I thought it 
was a young lady. Yes, a beauti- 
ful young lady’s face all glowing 
in the dark and looking at me 
from the fifth floor of the oppo- 
site apartment, which hereabouts 
is the floor just above the white 
blanket of frozen air. I’d never 
seen a live young lady before, 
except in the old magazines — Sis 
is just a kid and Ma is pretty 
sick and miserable — and it gave 
me such a start that I dropped 
the pail. Who wouldn’t, knowing 
everyone on Earth was dead ex- 
cept Pa and Ma and Sis and you? 

Even at that, I don’t suppose 
I should have been surprised. We 
all see things now and then. Ma 
has some pretty bad ones, to 
judge from the way she bugs her 
eyes at nothing and just screams 
and screams and huddles back 
against the blankets hanging 
around the Nest. Pa says it is 
natural we should react like that 
sometimes. 

When I’d recovered the pail 
and could look again at the op- 
posite apartment, I got an idea 
of what Ma might be feeling at 
those times, for I saw it wasn’t

a young lady at all but simply a 
light — a tiny light that moved 
.stealthily from window to win- 
dow, just as if one of the cruel 
little stars had come down out of 
the airless sky to investigate why 
the Earth had gone away from 
the Sun, and maybe to hunt down 
something to torment or terrify, 
now that the Earth didn’t have 
the Sun’s protection. 

I tell you, the thought of it 
gave me the creeps. I just stood 
there shaking, and almost froze 
my feet and did frost my helmet 
so solicf on the inside that I 
couldn’t have seen the light even 
if it had -come out of one of the 
windows to get me. Then I had 
the wit to go back inside. 

Pretty soon I was feeling my 
familiar way through the thirty 
or so blankets and rugs Pa has 
got hung around to slow down 
the escape of air from the Nest, 
and I wasn’t quite so scared. I 
began to hear the tick -ticking of 
the clocks in the Nest and knew 
I was getting back into air, be- 
cause there’s no sound outside in 
the vacuum, of course. But my 
mind was still crawly and uneasy 
as I pushed through the last blan- 
kets — Pa’s got them faced with 
aluminum foil to hold in the heat 
I— and came into the Nest. 

L et me tell you about the 
Nest. It’s low and snug, just 
room for the four of us and our 



things. The floor is covered with 
thick woolly rugs. Three of the 
sides are blankets, and the blan- 
kets roofing it touch Pa’s head. 
He tells me it’s inside a much 
bigger room, but I’ve never seen 
the real walls or ceiling. 

Against one of the blanket- 
walls is a big set of shelves, with 
tools and books and other stuff, 
and on top of it a whole row of 
clocks. Pa’s very fussy about 
keeping them wound. He says we 
must never forget time, and with- 
out a sun or moon, that would be 
easy to do. 

The fourth wall has blankets all 
over except around the fireplace, 
in which there is a fire that must 
never go out. It keeps us from 
freezing and does a lot more be- 
sides. One of us must always 
watch it. Some of the clocks are 
alarm and we can use them to 
remind us. In the early days 
there was only Ma to take turns 
with Pa — I think of that when 
she gets difficult — ^but now there’s 
me to help, and Sis too.' 

It’s Pa who is the chief guar- 
dian of the fire, though. I always 
think of him that way : a tall man 
sitting cross-legged, frowning an- 
xiously at the fire, his lined face 
golden in its light, and every so 
often carefully placing on it a 
piece of coal from the big heap 
beside it. Pa tells me there used 
to be guardians of the fire some- 
times in the very old days — vestal 



St 



6AIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



virgins, he calls them — although 
there was unfrozen air all around 
then and you didn’t really need 
one. 

He was sitting just that way 
now, though he got up quick to 
take the pail from me and bawl 
me out for loitering — ^he’d spot- 
ted my frozen helmet right off. 
That roused Ma and she joined 
in picking on me. She’s always 
trying to get the load off her feel- 
ings, Pa explains. He shut her up 
pretty fast. Sis let off a couple of 
silly squeals too. 

Pa handled the pail of air in a 
twist of cloth. Now that it was 
inside the Nest, you could really 
feel its coldness. It just seemed to 
suck the heat out of everything. 
Even the flames cringed away 
from it as Pa put it down close 
by the fire. 

Yet it’s that glimmery white 
stuff in the pail that keeps us 
alive. It 5jowly melts and van- 
ishes and refreshes the Nest and 
feeds the fire. The blankets keep 
it from escaping too fast. Pa’d 
like to seal the whole place, but 
he can’t — building’s too earth- 
quake-twisted, and besides he has 
to leave the chimney open for 
smoke. 

Pa says air is tiny molecules 
that fly away like a flash if there 
isn’t something to stop them. We 
have to watch sharp not to let 
the air run low. Pa always keeps 
a big reserve supply of it in buck- 



ets behind the first blankets, 
along with extra coal and cans of 
food and other things, such as 
pails of snow to melt for water. 
We have to go way down to the 
bottom floor for that stuff, which 
is a mean trip, and get it through 
a door to outside. 

You see, wheil the Earth got 
cold, all the water in the air froze 
first and made a blanket ten feet 
thick of so everywhere, and then 
down on top of that dropped the 
crystals of frozen air, making an- 
other white blanket sixty or sev- 
enty feet thick maybe. 

Of course, all the parts of the 
air didn’t freeze and snow down 
at the same time. 

First to drop oiit was the car- 
bon dioxide — when you’re shov- 
eling for water, you have to make 
sure you don’t go too high and 
get any of that stuff mixed in, for 
it would put you to sleep, maybe 
for good, and make the fire go 
out. Next there’s the nitrogen, 
which doesn’t count one way or 
the other, though it’s the biggest 
part of the blanket. On top of 
that and easy to get at, which is 
lucky for us, there’s the oxygen 
that keeps us alive. Pa says we 
live better than kings ever did, 
breathing pure oxygen, but we’re 
used to it and don’t notice. .Fi- 
nally, at the very top, there’s a 
slick of liquid helium, which is 
funny stuff. All of these gases in 
neat separate layers. Like a pussy

caffay, Pa laughingly says, what- 
ever that is. 

T WAS busting to tell them all 
about what I’d seen, and so 
as soon as I’d ducked out of my 
helmet and while I was still 
climbing- out of my suit, I cut 
loose. Right away Ma got nervous 
and began making eyes at the 
entry-slit in the blankets and 
wringing her hands together — ^the 
hand where she’d lost three fin- 
gers from frostbite inside the good 
one, as usual. I could tell that Pa 
was annoyed at me scaring her 
and wanted to explain it all away 
quickly, yet could see I wasn’t 
fooling. 

"And you watched this light 
for some time, son?’’ he asked 
.when I finished. 

I hadn’t said anything about 
first thinking it was a young 
lady’s face. Somehow that part 
embarrassed me. 

“Long enough for it to pass five 
windows and go to the next floor.’’ 
“And it didn’t look like stray 
electricity or crawling liquid or 
starlight focused by a growing 
crystal, or anything like that?” 
He wasn’t just making up those 
ideas. Odd things happen in a 
world that’s about as cold as can 
be, and just when you think mat- 
ter'would be frozen dead, it takes 
on a strange new life. A slimy 
stuff comes crawling toward the 
Nest, just like an animal snuffing 



for heat — that’s the liquid he- 
lium. And once, when I was little, 
a bolt of lightning — not even Pa 
could figure where it came from 
— -hit the nearby steeple and 
crawled up and down it for weeks, 
until the glow finally died. 

“Not like anything I ever saw,” 
I told him. 

He stood for a moment frown- 
ing. Then, “I’ll go out with you, 
and you show it to me,” he said. 

Ma raised a howl at the idea 
of being left alone, and Sis joined 
in, too, but Pa quieted them. We 
started climbing into our outside 
clothes — mine had been warming 
by the fire. Pa made them. They 
have plastic headpieces that were 
once big double-duty transparent 
food cans, but they keep heat and 
air in and can replace the air for 
a little while, long enough for our 
trips for water and coal and food 
and so On. 

Ma started moaning again, 
“I’ve always known there was 
something outside there, waiting 
to get us. I’ve felt it for years — 
something that’s part of the cold 
and hates all warmth and wants 
to destroy the Nest. It’s been 
watching us all this time, and 
now it’s coming after us. It’ll get 
you and then come for me. Don’t 
go, Harry!” 

Pa had everything on but his 
helmet. He knelt by the fireplace 
and reached in and shook the 
long metal rod that goes up the 



60 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



chimney and knocks off the ice 
that keeps trying to clog it. Once 
a week he goes up on the roof to 
check if it’s working all right. 
That’s our worst trip and Pa 
won’t let me make it alone. 

“Sis,” Pa said quietly, “come 
watch the fire. Keep an eye on 
the air, too. If it gets low or 
doesn’t seem to be boiling fast 
enough, fetch another bucket 
from behind the blanket. But 
mind your hands. Use the cloth 
to pick up the bucket.” 

Sis quit helping Ma be fright- 
ened and came over and did as 
she was told. Ma quieted down 
pretty suddenly, though her eyes 
were still kind of wild as she 
watched Pa fix on his helmet 
tight and pick up a pail and the 
two of us go out. 

P A led the way and I took hold 
of his belt. It’s a funny thing, 
I’m not afraid to go by myself, 
but when Pa’s along I always 
want to hold on to him. Habit, I 
guess, and then there’s no deny- 
ing that this time I was a bit 
scared. 

You see, it’s this way. We know 
that everything is dead out there. 
Pa heard the last radio voices 
fade away years ago, and had 
seen some of the last folks die 
who weren’t as lucky or well-pro- 
tected as us. So we knew that if 
there was something groping 
around out there, it couldn’t be 



anything human or friendly. 

Besides that, there’s a feeling 
that comes with it always being 
night, cold night. Pa says there 
used to be some of that feeling 
even in the old days, but then 
every morning the Sun would 
come and chase it away. I have 
to take his word for that, not 
ever remembering the Sun as be- 
ing anything more than a big 
star. You see, I hadn’t been born 
when the dark star snatched us 
away from the Sun, and by now 
it’s dragged us out beyond the 
orbit of the planet Pluto, Pa says, 
and taking us farther out all the 
time. 

I found myself wondering 
whether there mightn’t be some- 
thing on the dark star that 
wanted us, and if that was why 
it had captured the Earth. Just 
then we came to the end of the 
corridor and I followed Pa out on 
the balcony. 

I don’t know what the city ■ 
looked like in the old days, but 
now it’s beautiful. The starlight 
lets you see it pretty well — there’s 
quite a bit of light in those steady 
points speckling the blackness 
above. (Pa says the stars used to 
twinkle once, but that was be- 
cause there was air.) We are on 
a hill and the shimmery plain 
drops away from us and then 
flattens out, cut up into neat 
squares by the troughs that used 
to be streets. I sometimes make

my mashed potatoes look like it, 
before I pour on the gravy. 

Some taller buildings push up 
out of the feathery plain, topped 
by rounded caps of air crystals, 
like the fur hood Ma wears, only 
whiter. On those buildings you 
can see the darker squares of 
windows, underlined by white 
dashes of air crystals. Some of 
them are on a slant, for many of 
the buildings are pretty badly 
twisted by the quakes and all the 
rest that happened when the dark 
star captured the Earth. 

Here and there a few icicles 
hang, water icicles from the first 
days of the cold, other icicles of 
frozen air that melted on the 
roofs and dripped and froze 
again. Sometimes one of those 
icicles will catch the light of a 
star and send it to you so brightly 
you think the star has swooped 
. into the city. That was one of the 
things Pa had been thinking of 
when I told him about the light, 
but I had thought of it myself 
first and known it wasn’t so. 

He touched his helmet to mine 
so we could talk easier and he 
* asked me to point out the windows 
to him. But there wasn’t any 
light moving around inside them 
now, or anywhere else. To my 
surprise. Pa didn’t bawl me out 
and tell me I’d been seeing things. 
He looked all around quite a 
while after filling his pail, and 
just as we were going inside he 



whipped around without warn- 
ing, as if to take some peeping 
thing off guard. 

I could feel it, too. The old 
peace was gone. There was some- 
thing lurking out there, watching, 
waiting, getting ready. 

Inside, he said to me, touching 
helmets, “If you see something 
like that again, son, don’t tell the 
others. Your Ma’s sort of ner- 
vous these days and we owe her 
all the feeling of safety we can 
give her. Once — ^it was when your 
sister was born — I was ready to 
give up and die, but your Mother 
kept me trying. Another time she 
kept the fire going a whole week 
all by herself when I was sick. 
Nursed me and took care of the 
two of you, too. 

“'YT’OU know that game we 
sometimes play, sitting in a 
square in the Nest, tossing a ball 
around? Courage is like a ball, 
son. A person can hold it only so 
long, and then he’s got to toss it 
to someone else. When it’s tossed 
your way, you’ve got to catch it 
and hold it tight — and hope 
there’ll be someone else to 'toss 
it to when you get tired of being 
brave.” 

His talking to me that way 
made me feel grown-up and 
good. But it didn’t wipe away the 
thing outside from the back of 
my mind — or the fact that Pa 
took it seriously. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION

X T’S hard to hide your feelings 
about such a thing. When we 
got back in the Nest and took 
off our outside clothes, Pa 
laughed about it all and told 
them it was nothing and kidded 
me for having such an imagina- 
tion, but his words fell flat. He 
didn’t convince Ma and Sis any 
more than he did me. It looked 
for a minute like we were all 
fumbling the courage-ball. Some- 
thing had to be done, and almost 
before I knew what I was going 
to say, I heard myself asking Pa 
to tell us about the old days, and 
how it all happened. 

He sometimes doesn’t mind 
telling that story, and Sis and I 
sure like to listen to it, and he 
got my idea. So we were all set- 
tled around the fire in a wink, 
and Ma pushed up some cans to 
thaw for supper, and Pa began. 
Before he did, though, I noticed 
him casually get a hammer from 
the shelf and lay it down beside 
him. 

It was the same old story as 
always — I think I could recite the 
main thread of it in my sleep — 
though Pa always puts in a new 
detail or two and keeps improv- 
ing it in spots. 

He told us how the Earth had 
been swinging around the Sun 
ever so steady and warm, and the 
people on it fixing to make money 
and wars and have a good time 
and get power and treat each 



other right or wrong, when with- 
out warning there comes charg- 
ing out of space this dead star, 
this burned out sun, and upsets 
ever5Tthing. 

You know, I find it hard to be- 
lieve in the way those people felt, 
any more than I can believe in 
the swarming number of them. 
Imagine people getting ready for 
the horrible sort of war they 
were cooking up. Wanting it even, 
or at least wishing it were over 
so as to end their nervousness. 
As if all folks didn’t have to hang 
together and pool every bit of 
warmth just to keep alive. And 
how can they have hoped to end 
danger, any more than we can 
hope to end the cold? 

Sometimes I think Pa exag- 
gerates and makes things out too 
black. He’s cross with us once in 
a while and was probably cross 
with all those folks. Still, some 
of the things I read in the old 
magazines sound pretty wild. He 
may be right. 

t^HE dark star, as Pa went on 
telling it, rushed in pretty 
fast and there wasn’t much time 
to get ready. At the beginning 
they tried to keep it a secret from 
most people, but then the truth 
came out, what with the earth- 
quakes and floods — imagine, 
oceans of unfrozen water!-: — and 
people seeing stars blotted out by 
something on a clear night. First

off they thought it would hit the 
Sun, and then they thought it 
would hit the Earth. There was 
even the start of a rush to get to 
a place called China, because peo- 
ple thought the star would hit 
on the other side. But then they 
found it wasn’t going to hit either 
side, but was going to comewery 
close to the Earth. 

Most of the other planets were 
on the other side of the Sun and 
didn’t get involved. The Sun and 
the newcomer fought over the 
Earth for a little while — pulling it 
this way and that, like two dogs 
growling over a bone, Pa de- 
scribed it this time — and then the 
newcomer won and carried us off. 
The Sun got a consolation prize, 
though. At the last minute he 
managed to hold on to the Moon. 

' That was the time of the mon- 
ster earthquakes and floods, 
twenty times worse than anything 
before. It was also the time of 
the Big Jerk, as Pa calls it, when 
all Earth got yanked suddenly. 
Just as Pa has done to me once 
or twice, grabbing me by the col- 
lar to do it, when I’ve been sit- 
tii!fe too far from the fire. 

You see, the dark star was go- 
ing through space faster than the 
Sun, and in the opposite direc- 
tion, and it had to wrench the 
world considerably in order to 
take it away. 

The Big Jerk didn’t last long. 
It was over as soon as the Earth 



was settled down in its new orbit 
around the dark star. But it was 
pretty terrible while it lasted. Pa 
says that all sorts of cliffs and 
buildings toppled, oceans slopped 
over, swamps and sandy deserts 
gave great sliding surges that 
buried nearby lands. Earth was 
almost jerked out of its atmo- 
sphere blanket and the air got 
so thin in spots that people keeled 
over and fainted — though of 
course, at the same time, they 
were getting knocked down by 
the Big Jerk and maybe their 
bones broke or skulls cracked. 

We’ve often asked Pa how peo- 
ple acted during that time, 
whether they were scared or brave 
or crazy or stunned, or all four, 
but he’s sort of leery of the sub- 
ject, and he was again , tonight. 
He says he was mostly too busy 
to notice. 

You see. Pa and some scientist 
friends of his had figured out part 
of what was going to happen — 
they’d known we’d get captured 
and our air would freeze — and 
they’d been working like mad to 
fix up a place with airtight walls 
and doors, and insulation against 
the cold, and big supplies of food 
and fuel and water and bottled 
air. But the place got smashed 
in the last earthquakes and all 
Pa’s friends were killed then and 
in the Big Jerk. So he had to start 
over and throw the Nest together 
quick without any advantages.

5ust using any stuff he could lay 
bis hands on. 

I guess he’s telling pretty much 
the truth when he says he didn’t 
have any time to keep an eye on 
how other folks behaved, either 
then or in the Big Freeze that 
followed — followed very quick, 
you know, both because the dark 
star was pulling us away very 
fast and because Earth’s rotation 
had been slowed in the tug-of- 
war, so that the nights were ten 
old nights long. 

Still, I’ve got an idea of some 
of the things that happene<3 from 
the frozen folk I’ve seen, a few 
of them in other rooms in our 
building, others clustered around 
the furnaces in the basements 
where we go for coal. 

In one of the rooms, an old 
man sits stiff in a chair, with an 
arm and a leg in splints. In an- 
other, a man and woman are hud- 
dled together in a bed with heaps 
of covers over them. You can just 
see their heads peeking out, close 
together. And in another a beau- 
tiful young lady is sitting with a 
pile of wraps huddled around her, 
looking hopefully toward the 
door, as if waiting fof someone 
who .never came back with 
warmth and food. They’re all still 
and stiff as statues, of course, but 
just like life. 

Pa showed them to me once 
in quick winks of his flashlight, 
when he still had a fair supply 



of batteries and could afford to 
waste a little light. They scared 
me pretty bad and made my 
heart pound, especially the young 
lady. 

T^OW, with Pa telling his story 

’ for the umpteenth time to 
take our minds off another scare, 
I got to thinking of the frozen* 
folk again. All of a sudden I got 
an idea that scared me worse 
than anything yet. You see. I’d 
jiist remembered the’ face I’d 
thought I’d seen in the window. 
I’d forgotten about that on ac- 
count of trying to hide it from 
the others. 

What, I asked myself, if the 
frozen folk were coming to life? 
What if they were like the liquid 
helium that got a new lease on 
life and started crawling toward 
the heat just when you thought 
its molecules ought to freeze solid 
forever? Or like the electricity 
that moves endlessly when it’s 
just about as cold as that? What 
if the ever-growing cold, with the 
temperature creeping down the 
last few degrees to the last zero, 
had mysteriously wakened the 
frozen folk to life — not warm- 
blooded life, but something icy 
and horrible? 

That was a worse idea than 
the one about something coming 
down from the dark star to get us. 

Or maybe, I thought, both 
ideas might be true. Something 



«6 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



coming down from the dark star 
and making the frozen folk move, 
using them to do its work. That 
would fit with both things I’d 
seen — the beautiful young lady 
and the moving, starlike light. 

The frozen folk with minds 
from the dark star behind their 
unwinking eyes, creeping, crawl- 
ing, snuffing their way, following 
the heat to the Nest. 

I tell you, that thought gave 
me a very bad turn and I wanted 
very badly to tell the others my 
fears, but I remembered what Pa 
had said and clenched my teeth 
and didn’t speak. 

We were all sitting very still. 
Even the fire was burning silent- 
ly. There was just the sound of 
Pa’s voice and the clocks. 

And then, from beyond the 
blankets, I thought I heard a tiny 
noise. My skin tightened all over 
me. 

Pa was telling about the early 
years in the Nest and had come 
tp the place where he philoso- 
phizes. 

“So I asked myself then," he 
■aid, “what’s the use of going on? 
What’s the use of* dragging it out 
for a few years? Why prolong a 
doomed existence of hard work 
and cold and loneliness? The 
human race is done. The Earth 
is done. Why not give up, I asked 
myself — and all of a sudden I got 
the answer." 

Again I heard the noise, louder 



this time, a kind of uncertain, 
shuffling tread, coming closer. I 
couldn’t breathe. 

“Life’s always been a business 
of working hard and fighting the 
cold,” Pa was saying. “The 
earth’s always been a lonely 
place, millions of miles from the 
next planet. And no matter how 
long the human race might have 
lived, the end would have come 
some night. Those things don’t 
matter. What matters is that life 
is good. It has a lovely texture, 
like some rich cloth of“fur, or 
the petals of flowers — you’ve seen 
pictures of those, but I can’t de- 
scribe how they feel — or the fire’s 
glow. It makes everything else 
worth while. And that’s as true 
for the last man as the first.” 

And still the steps kept shuf- 
fling closer. It seemed to me that 
the inmost blanket trembled and 
bulged a little. Just as if they 
were burned into my imagination, 
I kept seeing those pieering, frozen 
eyes. 

“So right then and there,” Pa 
went on, and now I could tell that 
he heard the steps, too, and was 
talking loud so we maybe 
wouldn’t hear them, “right then 
and there I told myself that I was 
going on as if we had all eternity 
ahead of us. I’d have children 
and teach them all I could. I’d 
get them to read books. I’d plan 
for the future, try to enlarge and 
seal the Nest. I’d do what I could

to keep everything beautiful and 
growing. I’d keep alive my feel- 
ing of wonder even at the cold 
and the dark and the distant 
•tars.” 

But then the blanket actually 
did ihove and lift. And there was 
a bright light somewhere behind 
it. Pa’s voice stopped and his eyes 
turned to the widening slit and 
his hand went out until it touched 
and gripped the handle of the 
hammer beside him. 

TN through the blanket stepped 

the beautiful young lady. She 
stood there looking at us the 
strangest way, and she carried 
something bright and unwinking 
in her hand. And two other faces 
peered over her shoulders — men’s 
faces, white and staring. 

Well, my heart couldn’t have 
been stopped for more than four 
©r five beats before I realized she 
was wearing a suit and helmet 
like Pa’s homemade ones, only 
fancier, and that the men were, 
too— and that the frozen folk cer- 
tainly wouldn’t be wearing those. 
Also, I noticed that the bright 
thing in her hand was just a kind 
©f flashlight. 

The silence kept on while I 
swallowed hard a couple of times, 
•nd after that there was all sorts 
•f jabbering and commotion. 

They were simply people, you 
see. We hadn’t been the only ones 
lK> survive; we’d just thought so. 



for natural enough reasons. 
These three people had survived, 
and quite a few others with them. 
And when we found out how 
they’d survived. Pa let out the 
biggest whoop of joy. 

They were from Los Alamos 
and they were getting their heat 
and power from atomic energy. 
Just using the uranium and plu- 
tonium intended for bombs, they 
had enough to go on for thou- 
sands of years. They had a regu- 
lar little airtight city, with air- 
locks and all. They even gener- 
ated electric light and grew plants 
and animals by it. (At this Pa 
let out a second whoop, waking 
Ma from her faint.) 

But if we were flabbergasted 
at them, they were double-flab- 
bergasted at us. 

One of the men kept saying, 
“But it’s impossible, I tell you. 
You can’t maintain an air supply 
without hermetic sealing. It’s 
simply impossible.” 

That was after he had got his 
helmet off and was using our air. 
Meanwhile, the young lady kept 
looking around at us as if we 
were saints, and telling us we’d 
done something amazing, and 
suddenly she broke down and 
cried. 

They’d been scouting around 
for survivors, but they never ex- 
pected to find any in a place like 
this. They had rocket ships at 
Los Alamos and plenty of chem- 



M

ical fuel. As for liquid oxygen, all 
you had to do was go out and 
shovel the air blanket at the top 
level. So after they’d got things 
going smoothly at Los Alamos, 
which had taken years, they’d 
decided to make some trips to 
likely places where there might 
be other survivors. No good try- 
ing long-distance radio signals, of 
course, since there was no at- 
mosphere fo carry them around 
the curve of the Earth. 

Well, they’d found other col- 
onies at Argonne and Brookhaven 
and way around the world at 
Harwell and Tanna Tuva. And 
now they’d been giving our city 
a look, not really expecting to 
find anything. But they had an 
instrument that noticed the faint- 
est heat waves and it had told 
them there was something warm 
down here, so they’d landed to 
investigate. Of course we hadn’t 
heard them land, since there was 
no air to carry the sound, and 
they’d had to investigate around 
quite a while before finding us. 
Their instruments had given 
them a wrong steer and they’d 
wasted some time in the .building 
across the street. 

B y now, all five adults were 
talking like sixty. Pa was 
demonstrating to the men how he 
worked the fire and got rid of the 
ice in the chimney and all that. 
Ma had perked up wonderfully 

A PAIL OF AIR 



and was showing the young lady 
her cooking and sewing stuff, and 
even asking about how the 
women dressed at Los Alamos. 
The strangers marveled at every- 
thing and praised it to the skies. 
I could tell from the way they 
wrinkled their noses that they 
found the Nest a bit smelly, but 
they never mentioned that at all 
and just asked bushels of ques- 
tions. 

In fact, there was so much talk- 
ing and excitement that Pa for- 
got about things, and it wasn’t 
until they were all getting groggy 
that he looked and found the air 
had all boiled away in the pail. 
He got another bucket of air 
quick from behind the blankets. 
Of course that started them all 
laughing and jabbering agaitu 
The newcomers even got a little 
drunk. They weren’t used to so 
much oxygen. 

Funny thing, though — I didn’t 
do much talking at all and Sis 
hung on to Ma all the time and 
hid her face when anybody 
looked at her. I felt pretty un- 
comfortable and disturbed my- 
self, even about the young lady. 
Glimpsing her outside there, I’d 
had all sorts of mushy thoughts, 
but now I was just embarrassed 
and scared of her, even though 
she tried to be nice as anything 
to me. 

I sort of wished thesr’d all quit 
crowding the Nest and let us be 

6 « 



alone and get our feelings 
straightened out: 

And when the newcomers be- 
gan to talk about our all going 
to. Los Alamos, as if that were 
taken for granted, I could see 
that something of the same feel- 
ing struck Pa and Ma, too. Pa 
got very silent all of a sudden 
and Ma kept telling the young 
lady, “But I wouldn’t know how 
to act there and I haven’t any 
clothes.” 

The strangers were puzzled like 
anything at first, but then they 
got the idea. As Pa kept saying, 
“It just doesn’t seem right to let 
this fire go out.” 

W ELL, the strangers are gone, 
but they’re coming back. It 
hasn’t been decided yet just what 
will happen. Maybe the Nest will 
be kept up as what one of the 
strangers called a “survival 
school.” Or maybe we will join 
the pioneers who are going to try 
to establish a new colony at the 
uranium mines at Great Slave 
Lake or in the Congo. 

Of course, now that the stran- 
gers are gone, I’ve been thinking 
a lot about Los Alamos and those 
other tremendous colonies. I have 
a hankering to see them for my- 
self. 

You ask me. Pa wants to see 
them, too. He’s been getting 
pretty thoughtful, watching Ma 
and Sis perk up. 



"It’s different, now that we 
know others are alive,” he ex- 
plains to me. “Your mother 
; doesn’t feel so hopeless any more. 
Neither do I, for that matter, not 
having to carry the whole re- 
sponsibility for keeping - the hu- 
I man race going, so to speak. It 
scares a person.” ' 

: I looked around at the blanket 

walls and the fire and the pails of 
air boiling away and Ma and Sis 
sleeping in the warmth and the 
flickering light. 

“It’s not going to be easy to 
leave the Nest,” I said, wanting 
to cry, kind of. “It’s so small and 
there’s just the four of us. I get 
scared at the idea of big places 
and a lot of strangers.” 

He nodded and put another . 
piece of coal on the fire. Then he 
looked at the little pile and 
grinned suddenly and put a 
couple of handfuls on, just as if 
it was one of our birthdays or 
Christmas. 

“You’ll quickly get over that 
feeling son,” he said. “The trouble 
with the world was that it kept 
getting smaller and smaller, till it 
ended with just the Nest. Now 
it’ll be good to have a real huge 
world again, the way it was in the 
beginning.” ' 

I guess he’s right. You think 
the beautiful young , lady will 
wait for me till I grow up? I’ll 
be twenty in only ten years.

With 

These Hands 

By C M. KORNBLUTH 



I 

H ALVORSEN waited in 
the Chancery office while 
Monsignor Reedy - dis- 
posed of three persons who had 
preceded him. He was a little 
dizzy with hunger and noticed 
only vaguely that the prelate’s 
secretary was beckoning to him. 
He started to his feet when the 
secretary pointedly op»ened the 
door to Monsignor Reedy’s inner 
office and stood waiting beside it. 

The artist crossed the floor, 
forgetting that he had leaned his 
portfolio against his c^air, re- 



membered at the door and went 
back for it, flushing. The secre- 
tary looked patient. 

“Thanks,” Halvorsen mur- 
mured to him as the door closed. 

There was something wrong 
with the prelate’s manner. 

“I’ve brought the designs for 
the Stations, Padre,” he said, 
opening the portfolio on the desk. 

“Bad news, Roald,” said the 
monsignor. “I know how you’ve 
been looking forward to the com- 
mission — ” 

“Somebody else get it?” asked 
the artist faintly, leaning against 
the desk. “I thought his eminence

definitely decided I had the — ” 
“It’s not that,’’ said the mon- 
signor. “But the Sacred Congre- 
gation of Rites this week made a 
pronouncement on images of de- 
votion. Stereopantograph is to be 
licit within a diocese at the dis- 
cretion of the bishop. And his 
eminence — ’’ 

“S.P.G. — slimy imitations,” 
protested Halvorsen. “Real as a 
plastic eye. No texture. No guts. 
You know that. Padre!” he said 
accusingly. 

“I’m sorry, Roald,” said the 
monsignor. “Your work is better 
than we’ll get from a stereopanto- 
graph — to my eyes, at least. But 
there are other considerations.” 
“Money!” spat the artist. 
“Yes, money,” the prelate ad- 
mitted. “His eminence wants to 
see the St. Xavier U. building 
program through before he dies. 
Is that a mortal sin? And there 
are our schools, our charities, our 
Venus mission. S.P.G. will mean 
a considerable saving on procure- 
ment and maintenance of devo- 
tional images. Even if I could, I 
would not disagree with his emi- 
nence on adopting it as a matter 
of diocesan policy.” 

The prelate’s eyes fell on the 
detailed drawings of the Stations 
of the Cross and lingered. 

“Your St. Veronica,” he said 
abstractedly. “Very fine. It sug- 
gests one of Caravaggio’s care- 
worn saints to me. I would have 



liked to see her in the bronze." 

“So would I,” said Halvorsen 
hoarsely. “Keep the drawings. 
Padre.” He started for the door. 
“But I can’t—” 

“That’s all right.” 

The artist walked past the sec- 
retary blindly and out of the 
Chancery into Fifth Avenue’s 
spring sunlight. He hoped Mon- 
signor Reedy was enjoying the 
drawings and was ashamed of 
himself and sorry for Halvorsen. 
And he was glad he didn’t have 
to carry the heavy portfolio any 
more. Everything seer^ed so 
heavy lately — chisels, hammer, 
wooden palette. Maybe the padre 
would send him something and 
pretend it was for expenses or an 
advance, as he had in the past. 

Halvorsen’s feet carried him up 
the Avenue. No, there wouldn’t 
be any advances any more. The 
last steady trickle of income had 
just been dried up, by an an- 
nouncement in Osservatore Ro- 
mano. Religious conservatism 
had carried the church as far as 
it would go in its ancient role of 
art patron. 

When all Europe was writing 
on the wonderful new vellum, the 
church stuck to good old papy- 
rus. When all Europe was writing

izing the stereopantograph, the 
church stuck to good old ex- 
pensive sculpture. But not any 
more. 

He was passing an S.P.G. salon 
now, where one of his Tuesday 
night pupils worked: one of the 
few men in the classes. Mostly 
they consisted of lazy, moody, ir- 
ritable girls. Halvorsen, surprised 
at himself, entered the salon, 
walking between asthenic semi- 
nude stereos executed in trans- 
parent plastic that made the skin 
of his neck and shoulders prickle 
with gooseflesh. 

Slime! he thought. How can 
they — 

“May I help — oh, hello, Roald. 
What brings you here?’’ 

He knew suddenly what had 
brought him there. “Could you 
make a little advance on next 
month’s tuition, Lewis? I’m 
strapped.’’ He took a nervous 
look around the chamber of hor- 
rors, avoiding the man’s con- 
descending face. 

“I guess so, Roald. Would ten 
dollars be any help? That’ll carry 
us through to the 25th, right?’’ 

“Fine, right, sure,” he said, 
while he was being unwillingly 
towed around the place. 

“I know you don’t think much 
of S.P.G. , but it’s quiet now, so 
this is a good chance to see how 
we work. I don’t say it’s Art with 
a capital A, but you’ve got to 
admit it’s an art, something peo- 



ple like at a price they can afford 
to pay. Here’s where we sit them. 
Then you run out the feelers to 
the reference points on the face. 
You know what they are?” 

He heard himself say dryly: 
"I know what they are. The 
Egyptian sculptors used them 
when they carved statues of the 
pharaohs.” 

“Yes? I never knew that. 
There’s nothing new under the 
Sun, is there? But this is the heart 
of the S.P.G.” The youngster 
proudly swung open the door of 
an electronic device in the wall of 
the portrait booth. Tubes winked 
sullenly at Halvorsen. 

“The esthetikon?” he asked in- 
differently. He did not feel indif- 
ferent, but it would be absurd to 
show anger, no matter how much 
he felt it, against a mindless ag- 
gregation of circuits that could 
calculate layouts, criticize and 
correct pictures for a desired ef- 
fect — and that had put the artist 
of design out of a job. 

“Yes. The lenses take sixteen 
profiles, you know, and we set 
the esthetikon for whatever we 
want — cute, rugged, sexy, spir- 
itual, brainy, or a combination. 
It fairs curves from profile to pro- 
file to give us just what we want, 
distorts the profiles themselves 
within limits if it has to, and

S OMEHOW, Halvorsen got out 
with the ten dollars, walked 
to Sixth Avenue and sat down 
hard in a cheap restaurant. He 
had coffee and dozed a little, 
waking with a guilty start at a 
racket across the street. There 
was a building going up. For a 
while he watched the great ma- 
chines pour walls and floors, the 
workmen rolling here and there 
on their little chariots to weld on 
a wall panel, stripe on an electric 
circuit of conductive ink, or spray

plastic finish over the “wired" 
wall, all without leaving the sad- 
dles of their little mechanical 
chariots. 

Halvorsen felt more deter- 
mined. He bought a paper from 
a vending machine by the restau- 
rant door, drew another cup of 
coffee and turned to the help- 
wanted ads. 

^ The tricky trade-school ads 
urged him to learn construction 
work and make big money. Be a 
plumbing-machine setup man. Be

a house-wiring machine tender. 
Be a servotruck driver. Be a lum- 
ber-stacker operator. Learn pour- 
ing-machine maintenance. 

Make big money! 

A sort of panic overcame him. 
He ran to the- phone booth and 
dialed a Passaic number. He 
heard the ring-ring-ring and 
strained to hear old Mr. Kreh- 
beil’s stumping footsteps growing 
louder as he neared the phone, 
even though he knew he would 
hear nothing until the receiver 
was picked up. 

R ing - ring - ring. “Hello?’* 
grunted the old man’s voice, 
and his face appeared on the little 
screen. “Hello, Mr. Halvorsen. 
What can I do for you?” 

Halvorsen was tongue-tied. He 
couldn’t possibly say: I just 
wanted to see if you were still 
there. I was afraid you weren’t 
there any more. He choked and 
improvised : “Hello, Mr. Kreh- 
beil. It’s about the banister on 
the stairs in my place. I noticed 
it’s pretty shaky. Could you come 
over sometime and fix it for me?” 
Krehbeil peered suspiciously 
out of the screen. “I could do 
that,” he said slowly. “I don’t 
have much work nowadays. But 
you can carpenter as good as me, 
Mr. Halvorsen, and frankly 
you’re very slow pay and I like 
cabinet work better. I’m not a 
young man and climbing around 



on ladders takes it out of me. If 
you can’t find anybody else. I’ll 
take the work, but I got to have 
some of the money first, just for 
the materials. It isn’t easy to get 
•good wood any more.” 

“All right,” said Halvorsen. 
“Thanks, Mr. Krehbeil. I’ll call 
you if I can’t get anybody else.” 

He hung up and went back to 
his table and newspaper. His face 
was burning with anger at the old 
man’s reluctance and his own 
foolish panic. Krehbeil didn’t 
realize they were both in the same 
leaky boat. Krehbeil, who didn’t 
get a job in a month, still thought 
with senile pride that he was a 
journeyman carpenter and cab- 
inetmaker who could make his 
solid way anywhere with his tool- 
box and his skill, and that he 
could afford to look down on any- 
thing as disreputable as an artist - 
— even an artist who could car- 
penter as well as he did himself. 

Labuerre had made Halvorsen 
learn carpentry, and Labuerre 
had been right. You build a scaf- 
fold so you can sculp up high, 
not so it will collapse and you 
break a leg. You build your plat- 
forms so they hold the rock 
steady, not so it wobbles and 
chatters at every blow of the 
chisel. You build your armatures 
so they hold the plasticine you 
slam onto them.

platforms and armatures. The 
factories were calling for setup 
men and maintenance men for th<» 
production and assembly ma- 
chines. 

From upstate, General Vege- 
tables had sent a recruiting team 
for farm help — harv^sst setup and 
^maintenance men, a few openings 
for experienced operators of tank- 
caulking machinery. Under “of-

was heavy for computer men, for 
girls who could run the I.B.M. 
Letteriter, esp. familiar sales and 
collections corresp., for office ma-

outfit wanted an artist — no, they 
wanted a sales-executive who 
could scrawl picture-ideas that 
would be subjected to the crit- 
icism and correction of the es- 
thetikon. 

Halvorsen leafed tircdly 
through the rest of the paj>er. He 
knew he wouldn’t get a job, and 
if he did he wouldn’t hold it He 
knew it was a terrible thing to 
admit to yourself that you might 
starve to death because you were 
bored by anything except art but 
he admitted it 

It had happened often enough 
in the past — artists undergoing 



preposterous hardships, not, as 
people thought because they 
were devoted to art, but because 
nothing else was interesting. If 
there were only some impressive, 
sonorous word that summed up 
the aching, oppressive futility 
that overcame him when he 
tried to get out of art — only there 
wasn’t. 

He thought he could tell which 
of the photos in the tabloid had 
been corrected by the esthetikon. 

There was a shot of Jink Bitsy, 
who was to star in a remake of. 
Peter Pan. Her ears had been 
made to look not pointed but 
pointy, her upper lip had been 
lengthened a trifle, her nose had 
been pugged a little and tilted 
quite a lot, her freckles were 
cuter than cute, her brows, were 
innocently arched, and her lower 
lip and eyes were nothing less 
than pornography. 

There was a shot, apparently 
nncorrected, of the last Venus

Petulantly, Halvorsen threw

walked out. What had space 
travel to do with him? Vacations 
on the Moon and expeditions to 
Venus and Mars were part of the

H e took the subway to Passaic 
and walked down a long-still 
traffic beltway to his studio, al- 
most the only building alive in 
the slums near the rusting rail- 
road freightyard. 

A sign that had once said “F. 
Labuerre, Sculptor — Portraits 
and Architectural Commissions” 
now said “Roald Halvorsen; Art 
Classes — Reasonable Fees.” It 
was a grimy two-story frame 
building with a shopfront in 
which were rhounted some of his 
students’ charcoal figure studies 
and oil still-lifes. He lived up- 
stairs, taught downstairs fronts 
and did his own work downstairs, 
back behind dirty, ceiling-high 
drapes. 

Going in, he noticed that he 
had forgotten to lock the door 
again. He' slammed it bitterly. At 
the noise, somebody called from 
behind the drapes; “Who’s that?” 
“Halvorsen!” he yelled in a 
sudden fury. “I live here. I own 
this place. Come out of there I 
What do you want?” 

There was a fumbling at the 
drapes and a girl stepped be- 
tween them, shrinking from their 
dirt. 

“Your door was open,” she said 
firmly, “and it’s a shop. I’ve just 



been here a couple of minutes. I 
came to ask about classes, but 
I don’t think I’m interested if 
you’re this bad-tempered.” 

A pupil. Pupils were never to 
be abused, especially not now. 

“I’m terribly sorry,” he said. 
"I had a trying day in the city.” 
-Now turn it on. “I wouldn’t tell • 
everybody a terrible secret like 
this, but I’ve lost a commission. 
You understand? I thought so. 
Anybody who’d traipse out here 
to my dingy abode would ' be 
simpatica. Won’t you sit down? 
No, not there — humor an artist 
and sit over there. The warm 
background of that still-life 
brings out your color — quite good 
color. Have you ever been

classes. 

“We have figure classes, male 
and female models alternating, on 
Tuesday nights. For that I have 
to be very stern and ask you to 
sign up for an entire course of 
twelve lessons at sixty dollars. 
It’s the models’ fees — they’re ex- 
orbitant. Saturday afternoons 
we have still-life classes for be- 
ginners in oils. That’s only two 
dollars a class, but you might sign 
up for a series of six and pay ten 
dollars in advance, which saves 
you two whole dollars. -I also give 
private instructions to a few tal- 
ented amateurs.”

The price was open on that one 
— whatever the traffic would 
bear. It had been a year since 
he’d had a private pupil and she’d 
taken onlysix lessons at five dol- 
lars an hour,* 

“The still-life sounds interest- 
ing,” said the girl, holding her 
head self-consciously the way 
they all did when he gave them 
the patter. It was a good head, 
carried well up. The muscles 
clung close, not yet slacked into 
geotropic loops and lumps. The 
line of youth is heliotropic, he 
confusedly thought- “I saw some 
interesting things back there. Was 
that your own work?” 

She rose, obviously with the 
expectation of being taken into 
the studio. Her body was one of 
those long-lined, small-breasted, 
coltish jobs that the pre-Raphael- 
ites loved to draw. 

“Well — ” said Halvorsen. A de- 
liberate show of reluctance and 
then a bright smile of confidence. 
’'You'll understand,” he said pos- 
itively and drew aside the cur- 
tains. 

“What a curious place!” She 
wandered about, inspecting the 
drums of plaster, clay and plasti- 
cene, the racks of tools, the 
stands, the stones, the chisels, the 
forge, the kiln, the lumber, the 
glaze bench. 

“I like this,” she said deter- 
minedly, picking up a figure a 
half-meter tall, a Venus he had 



cast in bronze while studying 
under Labuerre some years ago, 
“How much is it?” 

An honest answer would scare 
her off, and there was no chance 
in the world that she’d buy. “I 
hardly ever put my things up 
for sale,” he told her lightly. 
"That was just a little study. I 
do work on commission only 
nowadays.” 

Her eyes flicked about the 
dingy room, seeming to take in 
its scaling plaster and warped 
floor and see through the wall to 
the abandoned slum in which it 
was set. There was amusement in 
her glance. 

I am not being honest, she 
thinks. She thinks that is funny. 
Very well, I will be honest. “Six 
hundred dollars,” he said flatly. 

^1 ■’HE girl set the figurine on its 
stand with a rap and said, 
half angry and half amused: “I 
don’t understand it. That’s more 
than a month’s pay for me. I 
could get an S.P.G. statuette just 
as pretty as this for ten dollars. 
Who do you artists think you 
are, anyway?" 

Halvorsen debated with him- 
self about what he could say in 
reply: 

An S.P.G. operator spends a 
week learning his skill and I 
spend a lifetime learning mine.

form distorted by formulae me-

chotests of population samples. I 
take full responsibility for my 
work; it is mine, though I use 
what I see fit from Egypt, Greece, 
Rome, the Middle Ages, the Ren- 
aissance, the Augustan and Ro- 
mantic and Modern Eras. 

An S.P.G. operator works in

He mumbled, “Orpheus,” and 
keeled over. 

H ALVORSEN awoke in his 
bed on the second floor of the 
building. His fingers and toes 
buzzed electrically and he felt 
very clear-headed. The girl and 
a man, unmistakably a doctor, 
were watching him. 

“You don’t seem to belong to 
any Medical Plans, Halvorsen,” 
the doctor said irritably. “There 
weren’t any cards on you at all. 
No Red, no Blue, no Green, no 
Brown.” 

“I used to be on the Green 
Plan, but I let it lapse,” the artist 
said defensively. 

“And look what happened!” 
“Stop nagging him!" the girl 



said. “I’ll pay you your fee.** 

“It’s supposed to come through 
a Plan,” the doctor fretted. 

“We won’t tell anybody,” the 
girl promised. “Here’s five dol- 
lars. Just stop naggfhg him.” 

“Malnutrition,” said the doc- 
tor. “Normally I’d send him to a 
hospital, but I don’t see how I 
could manage it. He isn’t on any 
Plan at all. Look, I’ll take the 
money and leave some vitamins. 
That’s what he needs — vitamins. 
And food.” 

“I’ll see that he eats,” the girl 
said, and the doctor left. 

“How long since you’ve had 
anything?” she asked Halvorsen. 

“I had some coffee today,” he 
answered, thinking back. “I’d 
been working on detail drawings 
for a commission and it fell 
through. I told you that. It was 
a shock.” 

“I’m Lucretia Grumman,” she 
said, and went out. 

He dozed until she came back 
with an armful of groceries. 

“It’s hard to get around down 
here,” she complained. 

“It was Labuerre’s studio,” he 
told her defiantly. “He left it to 
me when he died. Things weren’t 
so rundown in his time. I studied 
under him; he was one of the 
last. He had a joke — ‘They don’t 
really want my stuff, but they’re 
ashamed to let me starve.’ He 
warned me that they wouldn’t be 
ashamed to let me starve, but I

insisted and he took me in.” 
Halvorsen drank some milk 
and ate some bread. He thought 
of the change from the ten dol- 
lars in his pocket and decided not 
to mention it. Then he remem- 
bered that the doctor had gone 
through his pockets. 

“I can pay you for this,” he 
said. “It’s very kind of you, but 
you mustn’t think I’m penniless. 
I’ve just been too preoccupied to 
take care of myself.” 

“Sure,” said the girl. “But we 
can call this an advance. I want 
to sign up for some classes.” 

“Be happy to have you.” 

“Am I bothering you?” asked 
the girl. “You said something 
odd when you fainted — ‘Or- 
pheus.’ ” 

“Did I say that? I must have 
been thinking of Milles’ Orpheus 
Fountain in Copenhagen. I’ve 
seen photos, but I’ve never been 
there.” 

“Germany? But there’s nothing 
left of Germany.” • 

“Copenhagen’s in Denmark. 
There’s quite a lot of Denmark 
left. It was only on the fringes. 
Heavily radiated, but still there.” 
“I want to travel, too,” she 
said. “I work at La Guardia and 
I’ve never been off, except for an 
orbiting excursion. I want to go 
to the Moon on my vacation. 
They give us a bonus in travel 
vouchers. It must be wonderful 
dancing under the low gravity.” 



Spaceport? Off? Low gravity? 
Terms belonging to the detested 
electronic world of the stereo-< 
pantograph in which he had no 
place. 

“Be vgry interesting,” he said, 
closing his eyes to conceal disgust. 

“I am bothering you. I’ll go 
away now, but I’ll be back Tues- 
day night for the class. What 
time do I come and what should 
I bring?” 

“Eight. It’s charcoal — I sell 
you the sticks and paper. Just 
bring a smock.” 

“All right. And I want to take 
the oils class, too. And I want 
to bring some people I know to 
see your work. I’m sure they’ll see 
something they like. Austin Ma- 
lone’s in from Venus — he’s a spe- 
cial friend of mine.” 

“Lucretia,” he said. “Or do 
some people call you Lucy?” 
“Lucy.” 

“Will you take that little 
bronze you liked? As a thank 
you?” 

“I can’t do that!” 

“Please. I’d feel much better 
about this. I really mean it.” 
•She nodded abruptly, flushing, 
and almost ran from the room. 

Now why did I do that? he 
^ked himself. He hoped it was 
because he liked Lucy Grumman 
very much. He hoped it wasn’t a 
cold-blooded investment of a 
piece of sculpture that would 
never be sold, an3rway, just to

make sure she’d be back with 
class fees and more groceries. 

Ill 

S HE was back on Tuesday, a 
half-hour early and carrying 
a smock. He introduced her for- ■ 
mally to the others as they ar- 
rived ; a dozen or so bored young 
women who, he suspected, talked 
a great deal about their art les- 
sons outside, but in class used 
any excuse to stop sketching. 

He didn’t dare show Lucy any 
particular consideration. There 
were fierce little miniature cliques 
in the class. Halvorsen knew they 
laughed at him and his line 
among themselves, and yet, 
strangely, were fiercely jealous of 
their seniority and right to indi- 
vidual attention. 

\ The lesson was an ordeal, as 
usual. The model, a muscle- 
bound young graduate of the bar- 
bell gyms and figure-photography 
studios, was stupid and argu- 
mentative about ten - minute 
poses. Two of the girls came near 
a hair-pulling brawl over the 
rights to a preferred sketching 
location. A third girl had discov- 
ered Picasso’s cubist period dur- 
ing the past week and proudly 
announced that she didn’t /erf 
perspective in art. 

But the two interminable hours 
finally ticked by. He nagged them 
into cleaning up — not as bad as 



the Saturdays with oils'" — and 
stood by the open door. Other- 
wise they would have stayed all 
night, cackling about absent stu- 
dents and snarling sulkily among 
themselves. His well-laid plans 
went sour, though. A large and 
flashy car drove up as the girls 
were leaving. 

“That’s Austin Malone,” said 
Lucy. “He came to pick me up 
and look at your work.” 

That was all the wedge her 
fellow- pupils needed. 

“Aus-tin Ma-/one.' Well!" 

“Lucy, darling. I’d love to meet 
a real spaceman.” 

“Roald, darling, would you 
mind very much if I stayed a 
moment?” 

“I’m certainly not going to 
miss this and I don’t care if you 
mind or not, Roald, darling 1” 

Malone was an impressive fig- 
ure. Halvorsen thought: he looks 
as though he’s been run through 
an esthetikon set for ‘brawny’ 
and ‘determined.’ Lucy made a 
hash of the introductions and the 
spaceman didn’t rise to conver- 
sational bait dangled enticingly 
by the girls. 

In a clear voice, he said to Hal- 
vorsen: “I don’t want to take up 
too much of your time. Lucy 
tells me you have some things 
for sale. Is there any place we 
can look at them where it’s 
quiet?” 

The students made sulky exits.

“Back here,” said the artist. 

The girl and Malone followed 
him through the curtains. The 
spaceman made a slow circuit of 
the studio, seeming to repel ques- 
tions. 

He sat down at last and said: 
“I don’t know what to think, Hal- 
vorsen. This place stuns me. Do 
you know you’re in the Dark Ages ?’' 

People who never have given 
a thought to Chartres and Mont 
St. Michel usually call it the 
Dark Ages, Halvorsen thought 
wryly. He asked, “Technologi- 
cally, you mean? No, not at all. 
My plaster’s better, my colors 
are better, my metal is better — 
tool metal, not casting metal, 
that is.” 

“I mean hand work,” said the 
spaceman. “Actually working by 
hand.” 

The artist shrugged. “There 
have been crazes for the tech- 
niques of the boiler' works and 
the machine shop,” he admitted. 
“Some interesting things were 
done, but they didn’t stand up 
well. Is there anything here that 
takes your eye?” 

“I like those dolphins,” said 
the spaceman, pointing to a per- 
forated terra-cotta relief on the 
wall. They had been commis- 
sioned by an architect, then later 
refused for reasons of economy 
when the house had run way over 
estimate. “They’d look bully over 
the fireplace in my town apart- 



ment. Like them, Lucy?” 

“I think they’re wonderful,** 
said the girl. 

Roald saw the spaceman go 
rigid with tlie effort not to turn 
and stare at her. He loved her 
and he was jealous. 

Roald told the story of the dol< 
phins and said: “The price that 
the architect thought was too 
high was three hundred and sixty 
dollars.” 

Malone grunted. “Doesn’t seem 
unreasonable — if you set a high 
store on inspiration.” 

. “I don’t know about inspira- 
tion,” the artist said evenly. “But 
I was awake for two days and 
two nights shoveling coal and ad- 
justing drafts to fire that thing in 
my kiln.” 

The spaceman looked con- 
temptuous. “I’ll take it,” he said. 
“Be something to talk about dur- 
ing those awkward pauses. Tell 
me, Halvorsen, how’s Lucy’s 
work? Do you think she ought 
to stick with it?” 

“Austin,” objected the girl, 
“don’t be so blunt. How can he 
possibly know after one day?” 

“She can’t draw yet,” the artist 
said cautiously. “It’s all coordi- 
nation, you know — thousands of 
hours of practice, training your 
eye and hand to work together 
until you can put-a line on paper 
where you want it. Lucy, if you’re 
really interested in it, you’ll learn 
to draw well. I don’t think any of

the other students will. They’re 
in it because of boredom or snob- 
bery, and they’ll stop before they 
have their eye-hand coordina- 
tion.” 

“I am interested,” she said 
firmly. 

Malone’s determined restraint 
broke. “Damned right you are. 
In — ” He recovered himself and 
demanded of Halvorsen: “I un- 
derstand your, point about co- 
ordination. But thousands of 
hours when you can buy a cam- 
era? It’s absurd.” 

“I was talking about drawing, 
not art,” replied Halvorsen. 
“Drawing is putting a line on 
paper where you want it, I said.” 
He took a deep breath and hop>ed 
the great distinction wouldn’t 
sound ludicrous and trivial. “So 
let’s say that art is knowing how 
to put the line in the right place.” 

“Be practical. There isn’t any 
art. Not any more. I get around 
quite a bit and I never see any- 
thing but photos and S.P.G.s. A 
few heirlooms, yes, but nobody’s 
painting or carving any more.” 

“There’s some art, Malone. My 
students — a couple of them in the 
still-life class — are quite good. 
There are more across the coun- 
try. Art for occupational therapy, 
or a hobby, or something to do 
with the hands. There’s trade in 
their work. They sell them to 
each other, they give them to 
their friends, they hang them on

their walls. There are even some 
sculptors like that. Sculpture is 
prescribed by doctors. The occu- 
pational therapists say it’s even 
better than drawing and painting, 
so some of these people work in 
plasticene and soft stone, and 
some of them get to be good.” 
“Maybe so. I’m an engineer, 
Halvorsen. We glory in doing 
things the easy way. Doing things 
the easy way got me to Mars and 
Venus and it’s going to get me 
to Ganymede. You’re doing 
things the hard way, and your 
inefficiency has no place in this 
world. Look at you! You’ve lost 
a fingertip-!-some accident, I sup- 
pose.” 

“I never noticed — ” said Lucy, 
and then let out a faint, “Oh!” 
Halvorsen curled the middle 
finger of his left hand into the 
palm, where he usually carried it 
to hide the missing first joint. 

“Yes,” he said softly. “An acci- 
dent.” ‘ 

“Accidents are a sign of in- 
adequate mastery of material and 
' equipment,” said Malone senten- 
tiously. “While you stick to your 
methods and I stick to mine, you 
can’t compete with me.” 

His tone made it clear that he 
• was talking about more than en- 
gineering. 

“Shall we go now, Lucy? 
Here’s my card, Halvorsen. Send 
those dolphins along and I’ll mail 
you a check.”

T he artist walked the half- 
dozen blocks to Mr. Kreh- 
beil’s place the next day. He 
found the old man in the base- 
ment shop of his fussy house, 
hunched over his bench with a 
{powerful light overhead. He was 
trying to file a saw. 

“Mr. Krehbeil!” Halvorsen 
called over the shriek of metal. 

The carpenter turned around 
and peered with watery eyes. “I 
can’t see like I used to,” he said 
querulously. “I go over the same 
teeth on this damn saw, I skip 
teeth, I can’t see the light shine 
off it when I got one set. The 
glare.” He banged down his three- 
cornered file petulantly. “Well, 
what can I do for you?” 

“I need some crating stock. 
Anything. I’ll trade you a couple 
of my maple four-by-fours.” 

The old face became cunning. 
“And will you set my saw? My 
saws, I mean. It’s nothing to you 
— an hour’s work. You have the 
eyes.” 

Halvorsen said bitterly, “All 
right.” The old man had to drive 
his bargain, even though he might 
never use his saws again. And 
then the artist promptly repented 
of his bitterness, offering bp a 
quick prayer that his own failure 
to conform didn’t make him as 
much of a nuisance to tne world 
as I^rehbeil was. 



The carpenter was pleased as 
they went through his small stock 
of wood and chose boards to crate 
the dolphin relief. He was pleased 
enough to give Halvorsen coffee 
and cake before the artist buckled 
down to filing the saws. 

Over the kitchen table, Hal- 
vorsen tried to probe. “Things 
pretty slow now?” 

It would be hard to spoil Kreh- 
beil’s day now. “People are al- 
ways fools. They don’t know good 
hand work. Some day,” he said 
apocalyptically, “I laugh on the 
other side of my face when their 
foolish machine-buildings go 
falling down in a strong wind, all 
of them, all over the country. 
Even my boy — I used to beat him 
good, almost every day — he 
works a foolish concrete machine 
and his house should fall on his 
head like the rest.” 

Halvorsen knew it was Kreh- 
beil’s son who supported him by 
mail, and changed the subject. 
“You get some cabinet work?” 
“Stupid women! What they 
call antiques — ‘they don’t know 
Meissen, they don’t know Bieder- 
meier. They bring me trash to 
repair sometimes. I make them 
pay; I swindle them good.” 

“I wonder if things would be 
different if there were anything 
left over in Europe . .” 

“People will still be fools, Mr. 
Halvorsen,” said the carpenter 
positively. “Didn’t -you ;ay you

were going to file those saws to- 
day?” 

So the artist spent two noisy 
hours filing before he carried his 
crating stock to the studio. 

T UCY was there. She had 
brought some things to eat. 
He dumped the lumber with a 
bang and demanded: ‘‘Why 

aren’t you at work?” 

‘‘We get days off,” she said 
vaguely. ‘‘Austin thought -he’d 
give me the cash for the terra- 
cotta and I could give it to you.” 

She held out an envelope while 
he studied her silently. The farce 
was beginning again. But this 
time he dreaded it. 

It would not be the first time 
that a lonesome, discontented girl 
chose to see him as a combina- 
tion of romantic rebel and lost 
pup, with the consequences you’d 
expect. 

He knew from books, experi- 
ence and Labuerre’s conversation 
in the old days that there was 
nothing novel about the comedy 



— that there had even been art- 
ists, lots of them, who had 
counted on endless repetitions of 
it for their livelihood. 

The girl drops in with- gro- 
ceries and the artist is pleasantly 
surprised: the girl admires this 
little thing or that after payday 
and buys it and the artist is 
pleasantly surprised; the girl 
brings her friends to take lessons 
or make little purchases and the 
artist is pleasantly surprised. The 
girl may be seduced by the artist 
or vice versa, which shortens the 
comedy, or they get married, 
which lengthens it somewhat. 

It had been three years since 
Halvorsen had last played out 
the farce with a manic-depressive 
divorcee from Elmira : three years 
during which he had crossed the 
mid-point between thirty and 
forty; three more years to get 
beaten down by being unwanted 
and working too much and eating 
too little. 

Also, he knew, he was in love 
with this girl. 






He took the envelope, counted 
three hundred and twenty dollars 
and crammed it into his pocket. 
“That was your idea,” he said. 
“Thanks. Now get out, will you? 
I’ve got work to do.” 

She stood there, shocked. 

“/ said get out. I have work to 
do." 

“Austin was right,” she told 
him miserably. “You don’'t care 
how f>eople feel. You just want to 
get things out of them.” 

She ran from the studio, and

Halvorsen fought with himself 
not to run after her. 

He walked slowly into his 
workship and studied his array 
of tools, though he paid little at- 
tention to his finished pieces. It 
would be nice to spend about half 
of this money on open-hearth 
steel rod and bar stock to forge 
into chisels; he thought he knew 
where he could get some — but 
she would be back, or he would 
break and go to her and be for- 
given and the comedy would be 
played out, after all. 

He couldn’t let that happen. 

V 

A ALESUND, on the Atlantic 
side of the Dourefeld moun- 
tains of Norway, was in the lee 
of the blasted continent. One 
more archeologist there made no 
difference, as long as he had the 
sense to recognize the propellor- 
like international signposts that 
said with their three blades. Ra- 
diation Hazard, and knew what 
every schoolboy knew about pro- 
tective clothing and reading a 
personal Geiger counter. 

The car Halvorsen rented was 
for a brief trip over the moun- 
tains to study contaminated Oslo. 
Well-muffled, he could make it 
and back in a dozen hours and 
no harm done. 

But he took the car past Oslo, 
Wennersborg and Goteborg, 



along the Kattegat coast to Hel- 
singborg, and abandoned it there, 
among the three-bladed polyglot 
signs, crossing to Denmark. 
Danes were as unlike Prussians 
as they could be, but their un- 
fortunate little peninsula was a 
sprout off Prussia which radio- 
cobalt dust couldn’t tell from the 
real thing. The three-bladed 
signs were most specific. 

With a long way to walk along 
the rubble-littered highways, he 
stripped off the impregnated cov- 
eralls and boots. He had long 
since shed the noisy counter and 
the uncomfortable gloves and 
mask. 

The silence was eerie as he 
limped into Copenhagen at noon. 
He didn’t know whether the ra- 
diation was getting to him or 
whether he was tired and hungry 
and no more. As though thinking 
of a stranger, he liked what he 
was doing. 

ril be my own audience, he 
thought. God knows I learned 
there isn’t any other, not any 
more. You have to know when to 
stop. Rodin, the dirty old, won- 
derful old man, knew that. He 
taught us not to slick it and pol- 
ish it and smooth it until it 
looked like liquid instead of 
bronze and stone. Van Gogh was 
crazy as a loon, but he knew 
when to stop and varnish it, and 
he didn’t care if the paint looked 
like paint instead of looking like

sunset clouds or moonbeams. Up 
in Hartford, Browne and Sharpe 
stop when they've got a turret 
lathe; they don’t put caryatids on 
it. I’ll stop while my life is a life, 
before it becomes a thing with 
distracting embellishments such 
as a wife who will come to de- 
spise me, a succession of gradu- 
ally less worthwhile pieces that 
nobody will look at. 

Blame nobody, he told himself, 
lightheadedly. 

And then it was in front of him, 
terminating a vista of weeds and 
bomb rubble — Milles’ Orpheus 
Fountain. 

It took a man, he thought. Es- 
thetikon circuits couldn’t do it. 
There was a gross mixture of 
styles, a calculated flaw that the 
esthetikon couldn’t be set td 
make. Orpheus and the souls 
were classic or later; the three- 
headed dog was archaic. That 
was to tell you about the an- 
tiquity and invincibility of Hell, 
and that Cerberus knows Or- 
pheus will never go back into life 
with his bride. 

There was the heroic, tragic 
central figure that looked mighty 
enough to battle with the gods, 
but battle wasn’t any good 
against the grinning, knowing, 
hateftll three-headed dog it stood 
on. You don’t battle the pave- 
ment where you walk or the floor 
of the house you’re in; you can’t. 
So Orpheus, his face a mask of 



controlled and suffering fuiy, 
crashes a great chord from his 
lyre that moved trees and stones. 
Around him the naked souls in 
Hell start at the chord, each in 
its own way: the young lovers 
down in death; the mother down 
in death; the musician, deaf and 
down in death, straining to hear. 

Halvorsen, walking uncertainly 
toward the fountain, felt some- 
thing break inside him, and a 
heaviness in his lungs. As he 
pitched forward among the 
weeds, he thought he heard the 
chord from the lyre and didn’t 
care that the three-headed dog 
was grinning its knowing, hateful 
grin down at him.

VI ' 

Vj^HEN Halvorsen awoke, he 
™ supposed he was in Hell. 
There were the young lovers, 
arms about each others’ waists, 
solemnly looking down at him, 
and the mother was placidly 
smoothing his brow. He stirred 
and felt his left arm fall heavily. 

“Ah,” said the mother, “you 
mustn’t.” He felt her pick up his 
limp arm and lay it across his 
chest. “Your poor finger!” she 
sighed. “Can you talk? What 
happened to it?” 

He could talk, weakly. “La-« 
buerre and I,” he said. “We were 
moving a big block of marble 
with the crane — somehow the

finger got under it. I didn’t notice 
until it was too late to shift my 
grip without the marble slipping 
and smashing on the floor.” 

The boy said in a solemn, ado- 
lescent croak: “You mean you 
saved the marble and lost your 
finger?” 

“Marble,” he muttered. “It’s so 
hard to get. Labuerre was so old.” 

The young lovers exchanged a 
glance and he slept again. He was 
half awake when the musician 
seized first one of his hands and 
then the other, jabbing them with 
stubby fingers and bending his 
lion’s head close to peer at the 
horny callouses left by chisel and 
mallet. 

"Ja, ja,” the musician kept say- 
ing. 

Hell goes on forever, so for an 
eternity he jolted and jarred, and 
for an eternity he heard bicker- 
ing voices: “Why he was so fool- 
ish, then?” “A idiot he could be.” 
“Hush, let him rest.” “The chil- 
dren told the story.” “There only 
one Labuerre was.” “Easy with 
the tubing.” “Let him rest.” 

Daylight dazzled his eyes. 

“Why you were so foolish?” 
demanded a harsh voice. “The 
sister says I can talk to you now, 
so that is what I first want to 
know.” 

He looked at the face of — not 
the musician; that had been de- 
lirium. But it was a tough old 
face. 



“Ja, I am mean-looking; that 
is settled. What did you think 
you were doing without coveralls 
and way over your exposure 
time?” 

“I wanted to die,” said Hal- 
vorsen. There were tubes sticking 
in his arms. 

The crag-faced old man let out 
a contemptuous bellow. 

“Sister!” he shouted. “Pull the 
plasma tubes out before more we 
waste. He says he wants to die.” 

“Hush,” said the nurse. She 
laid her hand on his brow again. 

“Don’t bother with him. Sis- 
ter,” the old man jeered. “He is 
a shrinking little flower, too deli-

Work. They wanted me, to wear 
in their buttonholes like a flower. 
They were getting to me. An- 
other year and I wouldn’t have 
been an artist any more.” 

“Ja?" asked the old man. “Tell 
me about it.” 

Halvorsen told him, sometimes 
weeping with self-pity and weak- 
ness, sometimes cursing the old- 
man for not letting him die, some- 
times quietly describing this stat- 
uette or that portrait head, or 
raving wildly against the mad 
folly of the world.

At the last he told the old man 
about Lucy. 

“You cannot have everything, 
you know,” said his listener. 

“I can have her,” answered the 
artist harshly. “You wouldn’t let 
me die, so I won’t die. I’ll go 
back and I’ll take her away from 
that fat-head Malone that she 
ought to marry. I’ll give her a 
couple of happy years working 
herself to skin and bones for me 
before she begins to hate it — ^be- 
fore I begin to hate it.” 

“You can’t go back,” said the 
old man. “I’m Cerberus. You 
understand that? The girl is 
nothing. The society you come 
from is nothing. We have a place 
here . Sister, can he sit up?” 

The woman smiled and 
cranked his bed. Halvorsen saw 
through a picture window that 
he was in a mountain-rimmed 
valley that was very green and 
dotted with herds and unpainted 
houses. 

“Such a place there had to be,” 
said the old man. “In the whole 
geography of Europe, there had 
to be a Soltau Valley with winds 
and terrain just right to deflect 
the dust.” 

“Nobody knows?” whispered 
the artist. 

“We prefer it that way. It’s 
impossible to get some things, but 
you would be surprised how lit- 
tle difference it makes to the 
young people. They are great

travelers, the young people, in

they see the ruined cities that the

have been mad. It was a little 
travel party like that which 
found you. The boy was im- 
pressed by something you said, 
and I saw some interesting things 
in your hands. There isn’t much 
rock around here; we have fine 
deep topsoil. But the boys could 
get you stone. 

“There should be a statue of 
the Mayor for one thing, before 
I die. And from the Rathaus the 
wooden angels have mostly 
broken off. Soltau Valley used 
to be proud of them — could you 
make good copies? And of course 
cameras are useless and the best 
drawings we can do look funny. 
Could you teach the youngers at 
least to draw so faces look like 
faces and not behinds? And like 
you were saying about you and 
Labuerre, maybe one younger 
there will be so crazy that he will 
want to learn it all, so Soltau 
will always have an artist and 
sculptor for the necessary work. 
And you will find a Lucy or 
somebody better, I think better.” 

“Hush,” warned the nurse. 
“You’re exciting the patient.” 

“It’s all right,” said Halvorsen 
eagerly. “Thanks, but it’s really 
all right.”

C HIEF Officer Avery came 
up the tube into the bridge 
sucking a bulb of coffee. 
Second Mate Dart rose stiffly 
from the seat where he had spent 
his watch. “She’s all yours.” 
Avery was thin, hawk-nosed. 
His complexion was sallow lea- 
ther color, his hair lank and 
sparse. He had black eyes be- 
tween narrow lids and the angle 
at which they crossed his cheeks 



gave his face a look of clownish 
melancholy. Dart was stocky, 
stub-featured. His hair was Aire- 
dale-red ; he was abrupt and posi- 
tive in his movements. Stretching 
with a quick wide sweep of short 
arms, he joined Avery by the 
forward cupola. 

Avery leaned forward, looked 
up, down, right, left, tracing the 
veins of rose and electric blue 
across the black of macroid space.

He said over his shoulder, “She’s 
dim. Turn her up. Can’t see 
twenty feet at this level.’’ 

Dart, blinking, half-asleep, ad- 
justed a rheostat, increasing the 
flood of polarized light from the 
bow projectors, and the gristle- 
like lines of force out in macroid 
space shone with greater bril- 
liance and detail. 

Avery grunted, “That’s a lot 
different. And there’s a focus 
coming up, where those two 
stringers dent in toward each 
other.” 

Dart came to watch as the lines 
trembled, bjilged toward each 
other. Films of color began to 
flow from the area: wan yellow, 
pink, green. Suddenly a hot spark 
of red appeared. 

“There’s the focus,” said Avery 
sourly. “Three feet from your 
nose, the center of a sun.” 

Dart ruefully rubbed his chin, 
thankful that Avery rather than 
Captain Badt had caught him 
dozing. 

“Yeah, I guess so.” 

“Small to medium, from the 
kink to that inner blue line,” said 
Avery. “Well, let’s check for 
planets; that’s what we’re out 
here for.” 

Inch by inch they searched the 
cupola, up, down, right, left. Dart 
said, “By golly, here it is. Just 
like the illustration in the text. 
Maybe we’ll slice that bonus yet.” 
The hot red spark faded to yel- 



low; the twist of colored veins 
which signified a planet started 
to uncoil. Avery sprang back, 
snapped the drift switch, and the 
lines became static. 

For a moment he studied the 
pattern in the hemispherical cu- 
pola. “The sun’s right about 
here.” He indicated a point be- 
tween himself and Dart. “The 
planet’s just inside the cupola.” 
“We’re big men,” said Dart. 
Avery twisted his mouth in a 
saturnine grimace. “Either big, or 
a long way off in a freak direc- 
tion.” 

“With all these guys running 
loose claiming to be geniuses,” 
said Dart, “it’s funny one of them 
hasn’t figured it out.” 

Avery had been searching the 
cupola for further kinks. “Figure 
what out?” 

“What happ>ens when we go 
into macroid space.” 

“You’re a dreamer,” said Av- 
ery. “The universe shrinks, or we 
and the ship get cosmically big. 
The main thing is, we get there. 
Talk to Bascomb, he’ll give you 
ten answers, all different. That’s 
genius for you.” Bascomb was the 
ship’s biologist, who had gained 
himself the reputation of a tire- 
less polemist and theoretician. 

Avery took one more look at 
the kink. “Call the captain, ring 
general quarters. We’re going into 
normal space.”

nPHE unigen was an intelligent 
organism, though its charac- 
teristics included neither form 
nor structure. Its components 
were mobile nodes of a luminous 
substance which was neither mat- 
ter nor yet energy. There were 
millions’ of nodes and each was 
connected with every other node 
by tendrils similar to the lines of 
force in macroid space. 

The unigen might be compared 
to a great brain, 4he nodes cor- 
responding to the gray cells, the 
lines of force to the nerve tissue. 
It might appear as a bright 
sphere, or it might disperse its 
nodes at light speed to all cor- 
ners of the universe. 

Like every other asp>ect of real- 
ity, the unigen was a victim of 
entropy; to survive, it processed 
energy down the scale of avail- 
abihty, acquiring the energy from 
radioactive matter. The unigen’s 
business of living included a con- 
stant search for energy. 

There were periods of pleni- 
tude when the unigen would wax 
heavy with energy and might ex- 
pand the number of its nodes by 
a kind of parthenogenetic fission. 
Other times the nodes would 
wane, glowing only feebly, and 
the unigen would seek energy 
stuff like a wolf, stalking the 
planets, satellites, meteors and 
dark stars for crumbs of even 
low-grade energy material. Dur- 
ing a lean time, one of the nodes. 



approaching the planet of a small 
sun, became aware of quanta 
suggesting the presence of radio- 
activity: a spangle of distinctive 
color against a mottled back- 
ground. 

Hope, an emotion compounded 
of desire and imagination, was 
not alien to the unigen. It speed- 
ed the node forward and the ra- 
diation came hard and sharp. The 
node flitted down through a high 
scud of cloud. The glow of col- 
ored light stretched, elongated, 
and near its middle shone a 
markedly bright spot, like a dia- 
mond on a band of silver, evi- 
dently where the radioactive ma- 
terial broke surface. Toward this 
spot the unigen directed the node. 

As it dropped, the unigen 
sought evidences of danger: the 
spoor of energy-eaters, sources of 
static electricity, such as clouds, 
which might disrupt the tight 
coils of a node with a spark. 

The air was clear and the 
planet seemed free of dangerous 
life-forms. The node fell like a 
bright snowflake toward the cen- 
tral concentration of radioactiv- 
ity.

Dart muttered to Avery in a 
disgruntled voice, “I’d hardly call 
the place a tourist planet.” 
“Looks pretty grim in spots, 
but it looks like a bonus.” 

Dart sighed, shook his round 
red head. “There never yet was 
a world so tough that colonists 
wouldn’t flock out to it. If it’s not 
cold enough to freeze air and not 
hot enough to boil water, and if 
you can breathe without popping 
your eyes, then it’s land, and men 
seem to want it.” 

“I was born on a planet a hell 
of a lot worse than this,” said 
Avery shortly. 

' Dart was silent a moment; 
then, with the air of a man who 
refuses to admit discouragement, 
went on. “Well, it’s livable. 
Breathable atmosphere, temper- 
ature and gravity inside the criti- 
cal area, and — so far — no signs of 
life.” He went to the cupola, 
which now overlooked the world 
below. “At home the ocean’s blue. 
It’s yellow on Alexander, red on 
Coralasan. Here it’s green. Grass 
by-Jesus green.” 

“Different proposition altogeth- 
er,” said Avery. “The red and 
yellow come from plankton. This 
green is algae or moss or seaweed. 
No telling how thick it is. Might 
be a man could walk out on it 
and pasture his cows.” 

“Lots of good grazing,” ad- 
mitted Dart. “About four million 
square miles in sight from here. 



Probably the source of the plan- 
et’s oxygen. According to Bas- 
comb, there’s no surface vegeta- 
tion. Maybe lichens, a few shrubs 
and such. That sea-bed must 
be thick with humus. .” 

The speaker from the labora- 
tory click-clicked. On the other 
wing of the bridge Captain Badt 
snapped, “Report!” 

The code-sono opened the cir- 
cuit; the voice of Jason the geolo- 
gist said, “Here’s a full report on 
the atmosphere. Thirty-one per 
cent oxygen, eleven per cent he- 
lium, forty per cent nitrogen, ten 
per cent argon, four per cent CO2, 
the other four per cent inert. Sub- 
stantially an Earth-type atmos- 
phere.” 

“Thank you,” said Captain 
Badt formally. “Off.” 

He paced up and down the 
bridge frowning, his hands clasp- 
ed behind his back. 

“The old man’s in a hurry,” 
Avery said quietly to Dart. “I 
can read his mind. He doesn’t like 
survey duty, and he’s figuring 
that if he finds a good Class A 
planet, he can use it as an excuse 
to take off for Earth.” 

Captain Badt marched stiffly 
back and forth, paused, went to 
the speaker. “Jason.” 

“Yes, sir?” 

“What’s the story on the geol- 
-bgy so far?” 

“I can’t tell much from this 
high, but the relief seems gener-

ally a product of igneous action 
rather than erosion. Naturally, 
that’s a guess.” 

“A good ore planet, possibly?” 
“At a guess, y^s. There’s plenty 
of folding, lots of faults, not too 
much sediment. Where those 
mountains break up through the 
coastal strip. I’d expect schists, 
gneiss, broken rocks cemented 
with quartz and calcite.” 

“Thank you.” Captain Badt 
went to the magniscreen, watched 
the landscape drift past. He turn- 
ed to Avery. “I think we’ll dis- 
pense with further investigation 
and set down.” 

The speaker click-clicked. “Re- 
port!” said Captain Badt. 

It was Jason again. “I’ve lo- 
cated an extensive outcrop of ra- 
dioactive ore, probably pitch- 
blende or possibly carnotite. It 
shines like a searchlight when I 
drop the X-screen across the 
scoi>e. It runs along the shore just 
south of the long inlet.” 

“Thank you.” To Avery: 
“We’ll set down there.” 

T he reconnaissance party, con- 
sisting of Avery and Jason, 
walked along the black gravel 
pebbles of the shore. To their left, 
the ocean spread out to the hori- 
zon, a green velvety flat like a 
tremendous billiard table. To the 
right, black-shadowed gulleys 
led back into the mountains— 
crag-crested barrens of rock. The 



sun was smaller and yellower 
than Sol; the light was wan, like 
Earth sunlight through a pall of 
smoke. Although the air had been 
certified breathable, the men 
wore head-domes, precautions 
against possibly dangerous bac- 
teria or spores. 

Through a pick-up TV eye 
mounted above Avery’s dome. 
Captain Badt watched from the 
ship. “Any insects, animal life of 
any sort?” he asked. 

“Haven’t noticed any so far . 
That upholstered ocean should 
make a good home for bugs. Ja- 
son threw a stone out and it’s still 
sitting high and dry. I believe a 
man could walk out there with a 
pair of snowshoes.” 

“What is that vegetation to 
your right?” 

Avery paused, inspected the 
shrub. “Nothing very different 
from those around the ship. Just 
one of those paint-brush plants a 
little larger than the others. 
Country seems rather arid, in 
spite of this ocean. Takes rain to 
make good soil. Right, Jason?” 

“Right.” 

Captain Badt said, “After a 
while, we’ll check into the ocean. 
Right now I’m interested in that 
uranium reef. You should be al- 
most on top of it.” 

“I think it’s about a hundred 
yards ahead, a ledge of black 
rock. Yep, Jason’s detector is 
buzzing like mad . Jason says

it’s pitchblende — uranium oxide.” 
He stopped short in his tracks. 
“What’s the trouble?” 

"There’s a swarm of lights over 
it. Flickering up and down like 
mosquitoes.” 

Captain Badt focused the im- 
age on the screen. “Yes, I see 
them.” 

“Might be some sort of fire- 
flies,” ha2arded Jason. 

Avery took a few cautious steps 
forward, halted. One of the lum- 
inous sjjots darted up, sp>ed to- 
ward him, swung around his 
head, circled Jason, returned to 
the uranium ledge. 

Avery said uncertainly, “I 
guess they’re not dangerous. Some 
kind of bug, apparently.” 

Captain Badt said, “Peculiar 
how they’re concentrated along 
that ledge. As if they’re feeding 
on the uranium, or like the feel 
of the radiation.” 

“There’s nothing else nearby. 
No vegetation of any sort, so it 
must be the uranium.” 

“I’ll send Bascomb out,” said 
Captain Badt. “He can investi- 
gate more closely.” 

4( He 

T he node which originally dis- 
covered the planet settled on 
an outcrop of the uranium oxide 
and was presently joined by other 
nodes, fleeting in from less re- 
warding areas. The absorption of 
energy began; pressing against 
the massive blue-black rock, a 



r^ode would generate sufficient 
heat to vaporize a quantity of the 
ore. Enveloping the gas, the node 
worked a complicated alchemy 
which released the latent energy. 
The node absorbed this energy, 
compacting and augmenting its 
structure, - kinking its whorls of 
force into harder knots. At the 
same time it discharged a flood of 
energy into the lines to the rest 
of the unigen, and everywhere in 
the universe nodes shone with a 
new golden-green luster. 

Insofar as surprise may be 
equated to witnessing events 
which have previously been dis- 
missed as improbable, the unigen 
felt surprise when it sensed the 
approach of two creatures along 
the shore. 

The unigen had observed liv- 
ing creatures on other worlds. 
Some or these were dangerous, 
like the mirror-metal energy-eat- 
ers swimming in the thick atmos- 
phere of another uranium-rich 
planet. Others were unimportant 
as competition for food. These 
particular slow-moving creatures 
appeared harmless. 

To investigate at close hand, 
' the unigen sent out a node, and 
received a report of infra-red 
radiation, fluctuating electro- 
magnetic fields. 

“Harmless autochthones,” was 
the unigen’s summation. “Crea- 
tures living by chemical reaction 
at a low energy level, like the 



98 



GALAXY SCIENCE FltVlON 



land -worms of Planet 11432. Use- 
less as energy sources, incapable 
of damage to the hard energy of 
a node.” 

Dismissing further considera- 
tion of the two creatures, the uni- 
gen absorbed itself with the 
uranium bank . Odd. On the 
surface of the ore had appeared 
what seemed to be a vegetable 
growth, a peppering of tiny spines 
rising from little flat collars. They 
had not been evident previously. 

And here came another of the 
slow-moving creatures. This one, 
like the others, emitted infra-red 
radiation, several different weaker 
waves. 

The creature halted, then 
slowly approached the ledge. 

The unigen watched with mild 
curiosity. Precise visual defini- 
tion was beyond its powers, so 
the land-worm’s movements came 
as blurs of shifting radiation. 

It seemed 'to manipulate a 
metal object which glinted and 
reflected sunlight — evidently a 
bit of pitchblende which had at- 
tracted its attention. 

The land-worm moved closer. 
It made a few blurred motions, 
and suddenly appeared to have 
extended one of its members. It 
moved once more, and a mesh of 
carbonaceous material fell around 
one of the npdes. 

Interesting, thought the uni- 
gen. The land-worm evidently 
had been attracted by the glitter 



and motion. The action implied 
curiosity; was the creature more 
highly evolved than its structure 
indicated? Or possibly it sus- 
tained life by trapping small 
bright animals, such as phos- 
phorescent jellyfish from the sea. 

The land -worm drew the net 
close. To resolve the problem, 
the unigen permitted the node to 
be carried along. 

A brittle shell of another car- 
bon compound was cupped over 
the node and --an enclosure ef- 
fected. 

Was this perhaps the land- 
worm’s organ of digestion? There 
appeared to be no digestive juice, 
no grinding or crushing action. 

The land-worm moved slightly 
away from the ledge and per- 
formed a series of mysterious gy- 
rations. The unigen was puzzled. 

Two metal needles entered the 
brittle cage. In sudden consterna- 
tion the unigen sought to snap 
the node free.

along the pitchblende ledge. 
Presently it dipped from sight, 
and \:he shore of black-gray peb- 
bles slanted up from the green 
velvet ocean to the heavy shoul-

“Nothing out here. Captain,’* 
said Avery. “Just looks like more

“Very well, you can return.**

He added in a grumbling voice, 
“Bascomb’s on his way out to 
check on those flickering lights. 
He thinks they’re emanations, 
like will o’ the wisps.” 

Avery winked at Jason, and 
cutting off the band to the ship 
said, “Bascomb won’t be satisfied 
till he has one of ’em pinned to a 
board like a butterfly.” 

Jason held up a hand, signed 
Avery to listen. Avery switched 
back on the communication band, 
heard Bascomb’s precise voice. 

“ — from a distance of thirty 
feet, the spectroscope shows a 
uniform band, radiating at ap- 
parently equal intensity in all 
frequencies. This is curious. Nor- 
mal phosphors emit in discrete 
bands. Perhaps some such occur- 
rence like St. Elmo’s Fire is in- 
volved, though I confess I don’t 
quite understand — ” 

Captain Badt growled impa- 
tiently, “Are they alive or aren’t 
they?” 

Bascomb’s voice was petulant. 
*T’ve no idea. I’m sure. After all, 
this is a strange planet. The word 
‘life’ has a thousand interpreta- 
tions. Incidentally, I note a very 
odd type of vegetation growing 
on the pitchblende itself.” 

"Avery mentioned no vegeta- 
tion,” said Captain Badt. “I 
questioned him specifically.” 
Bascomb sniffed. “He could 
hardly have missed it. It’s a line 
of shoots about six inches talk

They’re like spikes, apparently 
stiff and crisp, rising from suckers 
clamped to the surface. Very 
similar to something I saw once 
on Martius Juvenal where a 
pitchblende vein breaks surface 
. It’s very peculiar. The roots 
seem to have drilled into the solid 
rock.” 

“You’re the biologist,” said 
Captain Badt. “You ought to 
know.” 

Bascomb’s voice took on a note 
of cheery assurance. “Well, we’ll 
see. I’ve read of emanations being 
observed near pitchblende dis- 
posits, but I have never observed 
them. Possibly the concentrated 
radioactivity might be acting on 
minute condensations of mois- 
ture . .” 

Captain Badt cleared his 
throat. “Very well, handle it your 
own way. Be careful and don’t 
stir them up; they might be dan- 
gerous in some way.” 

Bascomb said, “I’ve brought 
along a net and specimen bottle. 

I planned to capture one of the 
motes and examine it under the 
miscroscope.” 

“I suppose you know what 
you’re doing,” said Captain Badt 
in a tired voice. 

“I’ve devoted my life to the 
study of extraterrestrial life,” re- 
plied Bascomb stiffly. “I rather 
imagine that these motes are ana- 
logous to the sparkle-ticks of

Into the specimen jar. My, how

“Yes, I can see it. What’s it like 
under the microscope?” 

“Hm . .” Bascomb brought 
his pocket magnifier to bear. 
“There’s no resolution. I see a 
central concentration of fire; un- 
doubtedly that’s where the insect 
is. I think I’ll pass an electric 
spark through the creature and 
kill it, and perhaps I can examine 
it under higher power.” 

“Don’t stir ’em up — ” began 
Captain Badt. The screen flared 
white in his face, went dark. 
“Bascomb! Bascomb!” 

Captain Badt received no re- 
ply.

r|ESTRUCTION of a node 
sent a restless shiver through 
the unigen. A node represented 
an integral fraction of the uni- 
gen’s brain; it had been condi- 
tioned to modify a definite class 
of thoughts. When the node was 
destroyed, the thinking in the 
class was curtailed until another 
node could be produced and en- 
dowed with the same precise 
channels. 

The implications of the event 
were further cause for anxiety. 
The metal energy-eaters on an- 
other planet used the same tech- 
nique — a stream of electrons 
smashing across the center of the 

I I 



node, to upset the equilibrium. 
The result was a flash of released 
energy, which the metat ovoids 
were able to absorb. Apparently 
the land-worm had been sur- 
prised by the explosion and de- 
stroyed — possibly mistaking the 
node for some less energetic type 
of creature. 

It might be wise, thought the 
unigen, to destroy the land-worms 
as soon as they appeared, and 
thus prevent further accidents. 

Still another vexation: the 

spike-vegetation was spreading 
its collars across the surface of 
the ledge, sinking deep roots into 
the energy-stuff. Apparently it 
built the displaced material into 
the spike. When the unigen sent 
a node to absorb the leached 
uranium, it found a hard shell of 
inert substance, proof against the 
node’s kernel of heat. 

Nodes flickered and quivered 
all over the universe as the uni- 
gen marshaled its computative 
abilities. Rigorous steps would 
have to be taken. 

Jt= * * 

F ar down the beach, Avery 
and Jason saw the white flash 
of the explosion, saw the black 
gullies light up in a ghastly swift 
glare. Then came a rolling sound 
and a jar of concussion. 

Avery cut anxiously into the 
communication band. “Captain 
Badt, Avery calling. What’s hap- 
pened?”

Captain Badt said harshly, 
“That fool Bascomb’s just blown 
himself up.” 

“We’re up the beach about a 
mile, I think, from where the ex- 
plosion came,” said Avery hur- 
riedly. “Should we—” 

Captain Badt interrupted. 
“Don’t do anything. Don’t touch 
anything. This is a strange planet, 
and it’s dangerous. Bascomb’s 
just proved that.” 

“What did he do?” 

“He apparently ran an electric 
current through one of those 
bright spots of light, and it went 
off in his face.” 

Avery stopped short, looked 
warily up the shore. “We went 
past pretty closely and they 
didn’t bother us. It must be the 
electricity.” 

“You be careful on your way 
back. I can’t afford to lose any 
more men. Keep out of the way 
of those lights.” 

“Yes, sir,” said Avery. He mo- 
tioned to Jason. “Let’s go. We’d 
better skirt the water as close as 
possible.” 

Crowding the soggy verge of 
the ocean, they rounded the bend 
in the shoreline, approached the 
scene of the explosion. 

“Doesn’t seem to be much left 
of Bascomb,” said Jason in a 
hushed voice. 

“Not much crater either,” said 
Avery. “It’s a funny deal.” 

“Look, now there’s thousands 



of those light-bugs. Like bees 
around a hive. And look at that 
stuff growing out of the ledge! 
That wasn’t there when we went 
past! Talk about mushrooms . 

Avery turned his binoculars 
along the ledge. “Probably it’s 
got something to do with the 
light-flecks. The lights could be 
spores or pollen or something of 
the sort.” 

“Anything’s possible,” said Ja- 
son! “I’ve seen vines thirty miles 
long, as thick around as a house, 
and if you jab them with a stick 
they quiver their whole length. 
They’re on Antaeus. The kids in 
the Earth colony tap out Morse 
code back and forth to each 
other. The vine doesn’t like it, 
but there’s nothing it can do.” 
Avery had been watching the 
dancing lights over his shoulder. 
“They’re like eyes watching us 
. Before a colony’s sent out 
here, these damn things will have 
to be destroyed. They’d be dan- 
gerous flying loose around elec- 
tricity.” 

Jason said, “Duck! Here comes 
a couple of them after us!” 

Avery said in a nervous voice, 
“Don’t get excited, kid. They’re 
just drifting on the breeze.” 
“Drifting, hell,” said Jason, and 
started to run for the ship.

rpHE unigen observed the land- 
worms returning along the 
shore, evidently seeking the sea- 

ALAXY SC'ieImCE FI^tIoN

matter on which they fed. To 
guard against the accidental de- 
struction of any more nodes, it 
would be wise to destroy the crea- 
tures as they appeared, and clean 
them from this particular section 
of the planet. 

It dispatched two nodes toward 
the land-worms. They seemed to 
sense danger and broke into lum- 
bering motion. The unigen ac- 
celerated the nodes; they darted 
forward at half-light speed, punc- 
tured the land-worms, reversed, 
shuttled back and forth a score 
of times, each time leaving a 
small steaming hole. The land- 
worms collapsed to the black peb- 
bles, lay limp. 

The unigen brought the nodes 
back to the uranium bank. Now 
to a more serious matter : the 
vegetation which was choking off 
the face of the uranium with its 
collars and roots. 

The unigen concentrated the 
heat of twenty nodes on one of 
the spikes. A hole appeared, 
weakening the entire shoot. It 
sagged and shriveled, collapsed. 

Pleasure was a quality which 
the structure of the unigen was 
incapable of expressing, the nearr 
est approach being a calm coast- 
ing sense, an awareness of con- 
trol and mastery of movement. 
In this state the unigen began a 
systematic attack on the spikes. 

A second member fell over, be- 
came pale brown and a third . 



Overhead appeared a flying ob- 
ject, similar to a land-worm ex- 
cept that it radiated more strong- 
ly in the infra-red. 

Were the creatures everywhere? 

* * 

OECOND Officer Dart had 
made the original suggestion, 
diffidently at first, half -expecting 
Captain Badt to freeze him with 4. 
a stare the color of zinc. But Cap- 
tain Badt stood like a statue 
looking into the blank magni- 
screen, still tuned to Avery’s 
band. 

Dart said with somewhat more 
boldness, “So far we have no con- 
clusive report' to make. Is the 
planet habitable or not? If we 
leave now we haven’t proved any- 
thing.” 

Captain Badt answered in , a 
voice without resonance, “I can’t 
risk any more men.” 

Dart rubbed at his bristling 
red hair. It occurred to him that 
Captain Badt was getting old. 

“Those little lights are vicious,” 
Dart said emphatically. “We 
know that. They’ve killed three 
of our men. But we can handle 
them. An electric current blows 
’em apart. Another thing, they’re 
like bees around a hive; they 
mind their own business unless 
they’re bothered. Bascomb, 
Avery, Jason — they got it because 
they approached that pitchblende 
ledge too closely. Here’s my idea, 
and I’ll take the risk of carrying

it through. We knock together a 
light frame, string it with wire, 
and charge the strands alternately 
positive and negative. Then I’ll 
go up in the service ’copter and 
drift it across the ledge. They’re 
so thick now that we can’t help 
blit knock out two-three hundred 
at a swipe.” 

Captain Badt clenched and un- 
clenched his hands. “Very well. 
Go ahead.” He turned his back, 
stared into the blank magni- 
screen. This would be his last 
voyage. 

With the help of Henry, the 
ship’s electrician. Dart built the 
frame, strung it with wire, 
equipped it with a high-potential 
battery. Strapping himself into 
the ’copter harness, he rose 
straight up, dangling a mile of 
light cable. He became a speck on 
the gray-blue sky. 

“That’s it,” said Henry into 
the communication mike. “Now 
ril make fast this fly trap affair, 
and then — I’ve got another idea. 
We want the thing to move flat- 
side forward, so I’ll tie on a 
bridle with a bit of drag at the 
end.” 

He arranged the drag, snapped 
the switch on the battery. “She’s 
ready to go.” 

A mile above. Dart moved 
across the sky toward the ledge 
of pitchblende. 

Captain Badt maintained an 
iron grip on the hand rail in the 



bridge, watching Dart’s progress 
on the magniscreen. 

“Up, Dart,” he said. “Up four 
feet . There . Steady. That’s 
about right. Take it slow . .” 

* * ♦ 

^I’lHE unigen’s range of percep- 
tion included the lowest radio 
waves as well as the hottest ultra- 
cosmics, a spectrum of a million 
colors. Stereoscopic vision was 
implicit in the fact that each node 
served as an organ of sight. Reso- 
lution of images was achieved by 
accepting only radiation normal 
to the surface of the node. In this 
manner a coarse spherical picture 
was received by each node, al- 
though detail as fine as the frame 
strung with wire was nearly in- 
visible. 

The unigen’s first warning was 
a pressure from the approaching 
electrostatic fields ; then the frame 
swept across the ledge, full 
through the heaviest concentra- 
tion of nodes. 

The blast seared the ground, 
melted it into a flaming molten 
basin for a radius of fifty feet. 
The nodes which escaped the 
screen were flung pell-mell by the 
explosion out across the ocean. 

Directly under the explosion, 
the spike-vegetation was scorched; 
elsewhere, little affected. 

The structure of the unigen was 
no more capable of anger than 
pleasure; however, its will to sur- 
vive was intense. Overhead flew

the land -worm. One like it had 
destroyed a node through elec- 
tricity; perhaps this one was 
somehow associated with the last 
catastrophic explosion. Four 
nodes slanted up at light speed, 
snapped back and forth through 
the land-worm like sewing-ma- 
chine needles hemming a sheet. 
The creature fell to the ground. 

The unigen assembled its nodes 
a hundred feet over the bank of 
uranium. Ninety-six nodes de- 
stroyed. 

The unigen weighed the situa- 
tion. The planet was rich with 
uranium, but it was also the home 
of lethal land-worms. 

The unigen decided. There was 
uranium elsewhere in the uni- 
verse, on thousands of worlds that 
were silent and dark and free of 
any kind of life. A lesson had 
been learned : avoid worlds in- 
habited by life-forms, no matter 
how primitive. 

The nodes flashed off into the 
sky, dispersed into space. 

* * * 

C APTAIN Badt relaxed his grip 
on the table. “That’s it,” he 
said in a flat voice. “Any world 
where we lose four good men in 
four hours — any world inhabited 
by swarms of crazy atomic bees — ■ 
that’s no world for human be- 
ings. Four good men . .” 

He stood silent a moment, limp 
and dejected. 

The cadet wandered into the 



bridge, stared wide-eyed. Life- 
long habit reasserted itself. Cap- 
tain Badt filled out, became erect, 
rigid. His tunic and trousers hung 
crisp, his eyes once more shone 
with authority. 

“Ensign,, you will act as chief 
officer until further notice. We’re 
leaving the planet, returning to 
Earth. Please attend to all ex- 
terior ports.” 

“Yes, sir,” said the new Chief 
Mate. 

* * >(: 

fT’HE planelt was quiet. The 
ocean spread bright and 
green, the mountains rolled back 
into the badlands: crags, ravines, 
plateaus — black rock, gray rock, 
pockets of drifted ash. 

On the pitchblende ledge the 
vegetation waxed tall, five, ten, 
twenty feet, gray spines mottled 
with white, ivory, silver. In each 
a central vein op>ened; the spike 
became a tube straight and stiff 
as a cannon barrel. , 

At the bottom of the tube, the 
fruit of the plant began to de- 
velop. There was a spore-case, 
enclosed by a jacket into which 
water percolated. Below the 
spore-case opened another corn- 
partment, globe-shaped, com- 
municating with the base of the 
spike by four splayed channels. 

A nub of uranium 235 ac- 
cumulated in this chamber — one 
ounce, two ounces, three ounces, 
more «nd more diffused through 



the membranes of the plant by 
some evolutionary freak of a 
metabolism. 

The fruit was ripe. One by 
one, the spikes reached a cul- 
mination. A tension within the 
water-jacket increased past the 
breaking strain. The jacket split, 
flooded the compartment below 
th^ spore-case, surrounded the 
knob of uranium. 

Explosion. Steam bursting 
through the stern-pointing chan- 
nels, back into the tube. Thrust, 
straight up. Sharp whipping 
blasts as the cases left the spikes. 
Up, up, up, at furious accelera- 
tion, into space . 

The water dissipated, the last 
puff of steam left the tubes. The 
spore-cases floated free on mo- 
mentum. The gravitational field 
of the planet faded to a wisp, a 
film. The spore-cases drifted on. 
Now they cooled, cracked wide. 
From each a thousand capsules 
spilled into space, and the tiny 
jerk of the splitting case svit 
them in courses slightly diver- 
gent, enough to scatter them off 
toward different stars. 

Endless seeping of life across 
space. 

Smite into planet, the sift of 
spores, the search for the hot ele- 
ment, the growth, the culmina- 
tion, the blast, the impulse. 

Then space, years of drift. Out 
beyond, and past beyond .

TT is with genuine pleasure — 
and a sigh of relief — that I in- 
troduce herewith the guest re- 
viewer of the month, Robert A. 
Heinlein, who has written a really 
flavorful review. 

SPACE MEDICINE: THE HU- 
MAN FACTOR IN FLIGHTS 
BEYOND THE EARTH, Edited 
by John P. Mabarger, Research 
Director, Aeromedical Labora- 
tory, University of Illinois. Uni- 
versity of Illinois Press, 1951. 83 
pages. $2.00 paper, $3.00 cloth 

TN one way it was even more 
thrilling to open this book than 
it was to read the first edition of 



Willy Ley’s epoch-making Rock- 
ets. After all, Willy is One Of Our 
Own Boys, with a lifetime of de- 
votion to space flight and rocket 
research already half sp>ent. He 
believed in space flight, and so 
did we, while the idea was still 
considered ludicrous by all but 
an infinitestimal minority, mainly, 
of course, science fiction fans. 

Now enter the Respectable Cit- 
izens — government scientists and 
medical men, Air Forces mostly, 
soberly engaged in a-- practical 
project, to wit, making necessary 
medical preparation for a new 
field of activity — space — in ex- 
actly the same fashion in whichi.

for arctic or jungle warfare. The 
lead article in this symposium 
was written by the Air Forces 
Surgeon General himself. 

The section headings in the 
book are: Space Medicine in the 
United States Air Force; Mul- 
tiple-Stage Rockets and Artificial 
Satellites; Physiological Consid- 
erations of the Possibility of Life 
under Extraterrestrial Condi- 
tions; Astrophysics of Space 
Medicine; Orientation in Space; 
and Bio-Climatology of Manned 
Rocket Flight. 

The book is remarkably easy 
to read, and the special terms are 
all explained. Many of the data 
are new; much information was 
not formerly easily accessible. 
Convenient graphic displays pre- 
sent information on “living” con- 
ditions on the several planets, for 
example, and on how to control 
the temperature inside a space- 
ship. Elsewhere there is a descrip- 
tion of how Martian plants may, 
and probably do, create their own 
environments. And there is a dis- 
cussion of how congenital deaf 
mutes may make an almost in- 
dispensable contribution to the 
art of space flight, a contribution 
physically impossible for their 
unafflicted brethren. 

Readers of this magazine will 
probably want to buy the book; 
writers for this magazine had 
dam well better.

comments upon — 

FAR BOUNDARIES, edited by

pages, $2.95 

■f^IGHT readable and twelve 
practically illegible : this is 
the record for August Derleth’s 
ninth fantasy and science fiction 
collection. It includes four “clas- 
sics” and a bunch of contempor- 
aries divided into two sections — • 
“Mid-Period Pieces” and “The 
Contemporary Scene.” I shall not 
attempt to describe the signifi- 
cance of the latter two, since I 
haven’t any clear idea of what it 
may be. 

The eight good stories are: 

“Missing One’s Coach,” Anon., 
Dublin Literary Magazine, 1838. 
Antiquarian, but surprisingly 
lively and full of minor surprises.

H. A. Highstone, Astounding, 
1938.

Grendon, Arkham Sampler, 1949.

The other twelve — well, some 
may like them better than this 
reviewer. Personal tastes vary 
' widely, which partly explains the 
great number of anthologies com-

that the above are strictly my 
own preferences and I am notori-

error. 

WINE OF THE DREAMERS, 
by John D. MacDonald. Green- 
berg: Publisher, New York, 1951. 
219 pages, $2.75 

A GOOD example of the “we’re 
property” type of science fic- 
tion which assumes that an extra- 
terrestrial, extrahuman race is 
able to make us do more or less 
what it wants. 

In this well-written novel, 
many of the accidents, crimes of 
violence, and unexplained trage- 
dies of the world, and in particu- 
lar the failure of every attempt 
at launching a spaceship, are due 
to the machinations of a group 
of individuals numbering fewer 



than a thousand, called the 
Watchers. 

These Watchers, who inhabit a 
planet several star systems away, 
are able to enter the bodies of 
Earthians at will and make these 
bodies do anything they choose 
to. This is accomplished by 
super-hypnotism machines. The 
irony of the situation revolves 
around the fact that the Watch- 
ers are sublimely convinced that 
we are mere dreams created for 
their pleasure, and have no actual 
reality. 

The story is woven around the 
final discovery by the Watchers 
that we are “real,” and by us that 
most of our Earthly miseries are 
caused by these utterly remote 
aliens, who turn out to be de- 
scendants from our own ancestors 
of at least tens of thousands of 
years ago. 

That the plot and the concepts 
are not simon-pure originals, 
both being remimscent of Eric 
Frank ftussell’s famous “we’re 
property” novels, is unimportant. 
The skill and the imagination 
with which the tale is developed 
are genuinely satisfying.

SLAN is back! 

At last you can obtain a copy 
of this rare science fiction classic 



I N the eleven years since it was first 
written, A. E. van Vogt’s S/an has 
become one of science fiction’s legends 
and one of its rarities. Almost every 
reader of s-f has heard of this modern 
classic and could tell you, rather vague- 
ly* that it concerns a telepathic mutant 
race, hunted down and almost exter- 
minated by a frightened mankind. But 
very few have actually read S/an or 
own a copy of it. This is why: 

S/an first appeared, in magazine 
form, in the fall of 1940. It was issued 
in book form, five years later, in a 
limited edition that was quickly sold 
out.. Lately it has not been uncommon 
for readers to offer $10 or $15 for a 
copy; and there is at least one authen- 
ticated instance of a copy changing 
hands for $37. 

Finally, Simon and Schuster’s own 
science fiction fans decided that some- 
thing should be done about this. We 
persuaded van Vogt to lend us his only 
copy — which we promised to return 
unscarred. 

We found that S/an was even more

not a creature 
was stirring 

This could be a Christmas story. If it is, it 
shows one way peace on Earth can be attained! 



By DEAN EVANS 



H e was a tall, hard man 
with skin the color of 
very old iodine. When he 
climbed up out of the vertical 
shaft of his small gold mine, The 
Lousy Disappointment, he could 
have been taken for an Indian, 
he was that dark. Except, of 
course, that Indians didn’t exist 
any more in 1982. His name was 
Tom Gannett and he was about 
forty years old and he didn’t 
realize his own uniqueness. 

When he made it to his feet, 
the first thing he did was to 



squint up at the sun. The second 
was to sneeze, and the third to 
blow his nose. 

“Hey, you old sun!” he 
growled. “You old crummy sun, 
you look sicker’n a dog.” 

Which was literally true, for 
the sun seemed to be pretty queer. 
The whole sky seemed to be 
pretty queer, for that matter. 
Skies should be blue and the sun 
should be a bloated golden bauble 
drifting serenely across them. But 
the skies were not blue ; they were 
a dirty purplish -gray. And the

sun wasn’t a bloated golden bau- 
ble; somebody had it by the 
scruff of the neck and was drag- 
ging it. 

Gannett planted his big feet 
wide apart and frowned sourly 
around and sniffed the air like a 
dog at a gopher hole. "The damn 
world smells sick,” he grunted. 

Which was also true. The 
world did smell sick. The world 
smelled something like that pe- 
culiar odor that comas from an 
old graveyard carefully tended 
by an old man with dank moss 
sticking to the soles of his old 
shoes. That kind of smell. 

Gannett didn’t know why the 
sun looked sick, and he didn’t 
know why the world smelled sick. 
Indeed, there were many things 
Gannett didn’t know, among 
which would be these in par- 
ticular: 

(a) He £d not know (since, tor the 
lest six months, he bad been living 
and working all alone at his little mine. 
Which was in the remotest of the most 
remote desert regions of Nevada) that 
a little less than three weeks earlier, 
mankind bad finally achieved the in- 
evitable: mao's own annihilation. 

(b) He did not know that he was 
going to be the loneliest man on Earth 
—he who was used to, and perfectly 
content with, the hermitlike existence 
af a desert rat. 

(c) He furthermore did not know 
that there an»c four of the Ten Com- 
mandments which he wasn’t going to 
he able to break any more — not even 
if he stayed up nights trying and 
lived for centuries. 



^ANNETT snorted the smell 
from his nostrils and 
shrugged. Hell with it. He 
thought about Reno and how he 
hadn’t been there for nearly a 
year. He thought of the dimly 
lighted, soft-carpeted cocktail 
lounges in Reno where drinks 
come in long stemmed glasses 
and blondes in long-stemmed 
legs. Reno at Christmastime, he 
thought. There was a town, Reno! 

He grinned, showing big gold 
teeth that blazed out of his mouth 
like the glittering grille on a 
Buick. He dug his feet into the 
hard ground and walked the hun- 
dred feet or so to his cabin where 
he sometimes slept when he 
didn’t happen to sleep in the 
mine. He stripped off his grime- 
sodden clothes. He stepped out of 
them, in fact, and stretched luxu- 
riously as though he hadn’t felt 
the good joy of being unclothed 
for a long time. 

He got up and went to a cor- 
ner of the cabin, rummaged out 
a pair of dusty clogs and pushed 
his feet into them. Then — and 
they don’t come any nakeder 
than he was — he went outside and 
around the shack to the rear 
where he kept his jeep and where 
the shower was. 

He stepped into it, for it was 
nothing more ornate than a large 
oil drum suspended on long four 
by sixes. He yanked on a rope 
that bung down from the drum. 



1M 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The result of doing that made 
him leap out again dripping wet 
and colder than a buried mother- 
in-law. 

He shivered, eyes blinking fast. 
He took a deep breath. His gold 
teeth went together tightly and 
the big muscles in his neck corded 
defensively. He deliberately went 
under the shower again. Pawing a 
sliver of laundry soap from a 
ledge on one of the four by sixes, 
he went to work with it, and 
when he finally tripped the hang- 
ing rope once more, he was a 
clean man. 

He went into the cabin. It 
wasn’t any warmer than the great 
outdoors, but that was where his 
clothes were. He shaved from an 
old granite basin full of cold 
water. After that he went to a 
hook on the wall and got down 
a suit of clothes which looked as 
though it had shriveled up wait- 
ing for somebody to wear it. The 
last thing he did before leaving 
was to pry up one of the boards 
behind the door and lift out of 
this hiding place a small leather 
bag. 

The bag was filled with gold. 

^I'HE sun was gone novy. Leg- 
like rays of light still 
sprawled, dirty-Iooking, in the 
sky over toward the California 
line, but aside from these ex- 
tremities, most of it was some- 
where out in the Pacific. The 



purplish sky was darker now< 
Drab. Dead, somehow. 

The 'old jeep started nicely. It 
always started nicely; that wa« 
one of the good things about a 
jeep. The only funny thing was 
that out of its exhaust pipe in 
the rear came angry purplish 
flames. Queer flames. Gannett 
stared at them, surprised. 

“Even the damn jeep is sick," 
he muttered. He was wrong, of 
course, but he had no way of 
knowing that. He backed around, 
finally, and went down what h* 
called his driveway, which was 
little more than rock-strewn 
ground, until he came to a small 
dirt road. This led him to an-« 
other, larger dirt road, which in 
turn led him to route #395, 
which was a U.S. Highway. 

A hundred miles farther on, he 
came to the outskirts of Carson 
City. It wasn’t until he pulled 
into a gas station that he realized 
something was wrong. Nobody 
jumped out to wipe his wind- 
shield. The attendant who still 
leaned in the doorway of the sta- 
tion had a rag in his hand, but 
he didn’t budge. He couldn’t. His 
face looked like weathered 
leather and he was dead. 

“Holy. !’’ whispered Gan- 
nett incredulously. He forgot 
about needing gas. He jumped 
in the jeep and drove down the 

main stem and found Police 

• 

Headquarters in an old gray 



NOT A CREATURE WAS STIRRING 



IIS 



atone building. He knew it was 
Police Headquarters for the green 
neon over the revolving door had 
CPD on it and it was still burn- 
ing. 

He went up the steps two at a 
time, banged through the swing- 
ing doors and stamped straight 
to where the Sergeant’ sat at a 
desk over in the corner by the 
switchboard. 

“Hey, by God!” yelled Gan- 
nett to the Desk Sergeant. 
“There’s a guy down the street 
in a gas station and he’s stand- 
ing up in the doorway and he’s 
dead as a mackerel!” 

Dramatic words. But the Desk 
Sergeant was no longer among 
the living and didn’t appreciate 
them. It took Gannett a long 
while to get over that. He slowly 
backed away. He made the big 
oak doors, still backing. He went 
down the stairs on legs as stiff as 
icicles. 

He got back in his jeep and 
started up again. He knew there 
was something terribly wrong, 
but before he thought about it, 
he knew he had to have a drink. 
He pulled up in front of a saloon 
that had nice, cheery, glowing 
lights showing through the big 
front window. He got out of the 
jeep. He went through the swing- 
ing glass doors and straight to the 
bar. 

“Scotch!” 

Nobody answered. The barman 



behind the mahogany, facing 
him, didn’t make a move. The 
barman had a dead cigarette be- 
tween his cold colorless lips. The 
cigarette had a half inch of ash 
on it. The ash looked as though 
it was sculptured out of purple 
marble. 

Gannett put both hands flat on 
the bar and swallowed hard. He 
twisted his head and looked over 
the shoulder of a customer on his 
left, who was leaning negligently 
on the bar with one elbow. There 
was a half-full bottle in front of 
the leaning man and it had an 
alert-looking horse’s head stuck 
in the neck of it for a pouring 

SJJOUt. 

“Excuse me, Mac,” Gannett 
whispered. 

The leaning man didn’t twitch 
a muscle. 

Gannett sucked in a deep 
breath. He reached. He got the 
bottle. He blinked stupidly at 
the bottle and then he put it 
down very carefully and took an- 
other breath and looked at a 
highball glass in front of the lean- 
ing man. The highball glass was 
empty and clean, but the leaning 
man’s fingers were curled lightly 
and gracefully around it. They 
were nice fingers. White fingers. 
Fingers that looked as if they 
hadn’t had to do any hard work 
lately. Slender, tafjering, care- 
fully manicured fingers. 

Gannett swore softly. He 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



yanked the horse’s head out and 
then poked the bottle into his 
mouth and tilted it up. He held 
it until there wasn’t anything 
left but the very glass it was made 
of plus the bright little paper 
label. His throat burned. He 
coughed. He banged the empty 
bottle down on the bartop and 
coughed again — hard. 

The leaning man stirred, 
seemed to turn slowly, stiffly, in 
a half arc that put him face to 
face with Gannett. Then he went 
down backward and all in one 
piece, like a tall tree on top of 
a hill on a very still night. 

He went down with the glass 
in his hand and,* when he hit, 
swirls of thick dust rose lazily 
from the floor and then settled 
back over his rigid form like 
freshly falling snow blanketing 
something left out on the front 
lawn. 

rjpHE night was black. There 
wasn’t a star and there wasn’t 
a sound except for Earth sounds, 
which are never very loud. Gan- 
nett sat in his jeep with the motor 
running and the purple flames 
coming out of the tailpipe. His 
hands were tight around the 
wheel, but the Jeep wasn’t mov- 
ing. Gannett was staring off intp 
space and his eyes looked as 
though somebody had peeled 
them back. 

He said it to himself mentally, 



for the first few times. Then, as 
if he couldn’t contain them any 
longer, the words tumbled out of 
his mouth into the night air: 
“Everybody’s dead, by God!” 
He drove through deserted 
streets until he found an all-night 
drugstore. It didn’t seem funny 
to him just yet that the streets 
were deserted; that was some- 
thing he would think of later. 
He walked into the drugstore and 
went to the newsstand and picked 
up a copy of the Carson Daily 
Bugle. The date struck him first. 
It was the wrong date; it was 
three weeks ago. He dropped it 
and picked up another, a Reno 
paper this time. Same trouble 
with the date. He read the head- 
line then: 

REDS STRIKE AT TliRKEVl 
Unveil New Weapon 

He blinked at it. There was a 
little more — pitifully little — to 
the effect that Congress had been 
asked ftr a declaration of war in 
order to defend the assaulted 
member of the Atlantic Pact na- 
tions. 

Gannett swallowed hard. He 
dropped the paper and turned to 
the clerk who was leaning over 
the glass counter watching him. 

“Jeez!” Gannett said. “When 
did all this happen? I didn’t even 
know about it.” 

He didn’t get any answer from 



NOT A CREATURE WAS STIRRING 



117 



the clerk. He knew he wouldn’t 
from the way the clerk’s eyes 
looked. They looked as if they 
should have been under refrigera- 
tion. 

"People around dead,” he mut- 
tered. “By God, the Governor 
oughta know about this!” 

He left the drugstore and drove 
straight for the State Capitol 
Building, which wasn’t far away, 
for Carson City isn’t very large. 
He walked up the long concrete 
ribbon to the big stone steps. He 
mounted them. He stood before 
the bronze doors for an instant, 
a feeling of awe coming over him 
despite what he knew he was 
going to tell the Governor. He 
pulled on the handle of the near- 
est of the bronze doors. 

Nothing happened. 

It was locked, of course. The 
Capitol is never open at three 
A.M. (which was the exact time 
when it had happened three 
weeks ago — ^but he didn’t know 
that). • 

A feeling of rage came over 
Gannett slowly, like heat radiat- 
ing through soft wood. He stood 
on the stone steps and faced the 
broad expanse of lawn, which, in 
the summertime, at -least, was 
very lovely. He slowly pulled his 
leather bag of gold from his coat 
pocket and raised it up so he 
could see it. Then he turned once 
naore to the bronze doors and 
smashed the bag of gold through 



one of the glass panes. 

“Gannett done it!” he roared. 
"If anybody wants to know, tell 
them Gannett, by God!” 

He went back to his jeep. The 
big, darkly hulking form of the 
red brick Post Office Building 
went by and faded into the night. 
He passed a jewelry store. He 
looked in. An electric mantel 
clock in the store window indi- 
cated the time as nine-ten. He 
passed a supermarket. The big 
illuminated clock on the facade 
said nine-seven. The clock in the 
service station, where he finally 
pulled in for gas, pointed at nine 
exactly. Cycles have to be con- 
trolled if electric clocks are to 
keep correct time, but that was 
something else he did not know. 

After he put back the gasoline 
hose, he left one more observa- 
tion on the silence of the night 
before driving to Reno. He said it 
loudly, and there was angry 
frustration in every word of it: 
"Hell with Carson City. To 
hell with it!” 

A pproaching downtown 

Reno at night is a pleasant, 
cheerful Experience. There are 
lights all around, like a store 
selling electric fixtures. On the 
right hand side of Virginia 
Street ^ey glow brightly, each 
one a little gaudier than the last. 
Big lights. Neon lights in all the 
colors neon lights can come in. 



110 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Signs on the fronts of the big 
gaming houses that stay open 
until lights aren’t needed any 
more; and the one flash of light 
across Virginia Street at the in- 
tersection of Commercial Row 
which had been photographed 
more times than the mind of man 
could have conjectured: 

RENO 

The Bi^^eat Little City in the World 

He drove slowly by the Happy 
Times Club. He could see quite 
a few people inside. You wouldn’t 
think there was anything wrong 
when you looked at something 
like that. ' 

At the corner of First Street, 
he stopped for the signal. He 
pulled around a military vehicle 
that seemed to be waiting for the 
signal, too. It was an open vehi- 
cle, painted the olive drab of the 
Army, and sitting stiffly erect be- 
hind the wheel was a natty-look- 
ing first lieutenant with his cap 
at just the right angle over one 
eye. 

The signal bell up on the cor- 
ner poles clanged loudly and the 
lights turned green. Gannett 
crossed the intersection, but the 
lieutenant and his military ve- 
hicle stayed behind. 

He went by the Golden Bub- 
t)le, which was perhaps the largest 
and gaudiest of all the gaming 
places in Reno. Its big front, done 



in glass bricks with multicolored 
lights . behind them, looked like 
some monstrous kaleidoscope 
built for the use of the Man in 
the Moon. Seen from his jeep, 
through the plate glass of the 
wide door, the interior of the 
Golden Bubble seemed to be a 
Jiappy, carousing place full of the 
joyous laughter of folks having 
a fine time. Only that wasn’t so, 
of course, for the only sounds to 
be heard were the jeep’s motor 
and the signal bells on the corner 
poles. 

Gannett parked. He walked 
back, went slowly through the 
doors of the Golden Bubble. The 
first thing that met his eyes was 
the flashing welcome grin of the 
head waiter, who was dressed in 
a tuxedo just inside the doors. 
The head waiter had his hand 
half out, as if to shake the hand 
of Gannett as he came in. Gan- 
nett almost stuck out his own 
hand in return — but not quite. 

He went to the bar. He didn’t 
look at the barman lying on the 
floor with his ear in the spittoon. 
He shambled around the end of 
tha bar, took a full bottle of 
scotch off the backbar shelf, 
broke the seal and took a long 
swallow. The bartender didn’t 
notice. 

After that he took the bottle 
with him out on the floor. He 
went around a man in an over- 
coat who looked to be uncom- 



NOT A CREATURE WAS STIRRING 



lit 



fortably warm but wasn’t. He 
went over to a roulette table and 
stared the croupier straight in 
the eyes. He reached for a pile 
of chips under th6 croupier’s right 
hand and slid them over. 

“Double zero,” he said. 

The croupier looked bored, 
which was the way a croupier 
should look. Gannett reached 
down and gave the wheel a spin 
and then stood back and waited. 
The croupier waited. Two women 
and one man, on Gannett’s right, 
also waited. The ball clicked 
merrily, came to a stop. The 
wheel slowed, finally rested. 

It wasn’t double zero. Gannett 
reached for the croupier’s rake 
and shoved his pile of chips back 
under the croupier’s protecting 
right hand. 

“Lousy wheel is fixed,” Gannett 
said. 

Nobody argued with him on 
that. 

He uncorked his scotch bottle 
and took a long pull. Nobody 
objected to that, either, the 
croupier still looked bored; and 
the two women and the one man 
waited patiently for the Day of 
Judgment. 

Gannett went over to a cashier 
window and reached in and got 
a handful of silver dollars. He 
took them to the machines over 
against the far wall and stuck in 
a couple and pulled the two han- 
dles simultaneously. For his in- 



vestment he got back five dol- 
lars, which one of the machines 
disgorged with a loud clatter. He 
put more dollars in. He put them 
in fast and pulled the levers fast. 
He went down the entire row of 
machines and pulled the levers as 
he went. He didn’t linger to see 
what happened at any of them. 

He began to feel cold. He took 
out his scotch bottle again and 
half emptied it. A woman who 
looked as if she were someone’s 
great-grandmother, except that 
her hair was bleached and finger- 
nails were sharp talons, and who 
sat in a chrome and leather chair 
not six feet away from him, 
stared a little disapprovingly. 
Gannett caught the look. 

“Lady,” he said defensively, “I 
earned me a holiday, see? It’s 
none of your business if I do 
some celebrating, is it?” 

The lady didn’t change her 
mind. She looked as though she 
might prefer gin herself. 

Gannett belched. He wasn’t so 
cold' now. He threw back his head 
and laughed and listened to the 
sound of it bounce off walls. He 
_^did it again. He was feeling fine. 

He went back to the roulette 
wheel, got around behind it and 
nudged the croupier gently. The 
croupier went over like a broom 
sliding down the side of a wall. 

Gannett picked up the little 
plastic rake and looked at the 
two women and one man. 



120 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Place your bets, folks,” he 
said, in a low tone that was a 
pretty good imitation of the 
drone of a professional man. 

He separated the chips into 
four neat piles. He pushed a pile 
each at the two women, one to 
the man. The last he kept for 
himself. 

“Place your bets, folks,” he re- 
peated. 

Nobody did, but that was okay 
anyhow. Grinning happily, he 
made bets for them. One of the 
women — ^the one that was red- 
headed — ^looked to him as if she 
might be a plunger. He shbved 
her pile of chips over onto zero 
and then he gave her a friendly 
little wink. The other woman was 
the careful type, he thought. Her 
chips — ^not all of them, of course 
-—he shoved for red. He disposed 
of the man perfunctorily: ten 
dollars on plain number nine. His 
own bet was due a little more de- 
liberation. He carefully spread 
around five hundred dollars until 
the strip looked as if eighteen 
people were playing it all at once. 

The effort made him sweat. He 
reached for his bottle, emptied it, 
then dropped it on the fallen 
croupier. 

“Folks,” Gannett said in an 
apologetic tone, “you’ll have to 
pardon me a minute. It seems I’m 
out of fuel. Don’t go away; I’ll 
be right back.” 

Everybody was agreeable. 



Gannett went back to the bar, 
went around behind it. 

He said to the barman: “I got 
a party out there. Doc. A big 
party, see? The house might 
stand to make a mint. How’s 
about drinks?” 

The barman considered it. The 
barman was still considering it 
when Gannett went back to the 
wheel with a fifth of scotch and 
four glasses and a dish of olives. 
He made drinks. In each one he 
put an olive. By this time, of 
course, he was getting a little 
loud, but nobody could blame 
him for that. When the drinks 
were made and placed before the 
two women and the man, he was 
ready. He grinned around, rubbed 
his hands together and winked a 
sly little leering wink at the red- 
head. 

The wheel spun, stopped. Zero. 
The redhead had brought down 
the house. 

“By God!” whispered Gannett 
in frank admiration. “Lady, you 
sure got luck. ’Nother little snifter 
just to nail it tight?” 

Gannett liked the idea. He 
drank her drink for her and made 
a face over the olive. He poured 
another. He made more bets for 
everybody and then thought of 
something. Excusing himself once 
more, he got a roll of quarters 
from the cashier cage and, break- 
ing it open, fed them into a big 
glittering juke box over in the

T21

corner. That done, he pushed 
down a row of tabs and went back 
to the table. 

Everybody seemed to be hav- 
ing a time. The redhead just 
couldn’t lose. Three separate 
times Gannett was forced to col- 
lect chips from other tables in 
order to keep the game going, but 
he didn’t mind. He even said to 
the redhead once: 

“Lady, ten more minutes and 
we sign the joint over to you. But 
have fun; you’re doing swell." 

Once more he consulted the 
thoughtful barman, and more 
than once he had to go back to 
the juke box and punch tabs, 
but that was all right. He liked 
music. 

At ten minutes past three in 
the morning, with all the chips 
in the place before the lucky red- 
head he finished his last -bottle. 

He lifted his eyes and consid- 
ered a crystal chandelier which 
hung from the exact center of the 
broad ceiling. It was a beautiful 
chandelier. It looked as though 
it might have graced the banquet 
hall of some castle over in Eng- 
land, back in the days when Eng- 
land was a tight little isle. He 
grinned appreciatively at it. He 
pitched the empty bottle upward. 

There was a crash. Half the 
lights in the place went out. 

Bowing solemnly to the scat- 
tered immobile figures, Gannett 
lurched to the big door up front. 



He tried a bow to the friendly 
floorman, but it didn’t quite go 
over. He banged through the 
doors and out into the street. 

G annett groaned his aching 
body out of bed and padded 
heavily to the window. He put 
his big hands on the sill and 
looked out. Purple snow was fall- 
ing on a quiet world. The flakes 
came down softly, big wet, col- 
ored things like fluffy bits of cot- 
ton candy escaping from a circus 
in the skj'. There was his jeep 
down on the street where he had 
left it. He could recognize it, for 
it was the only jeep on the block. 

“Then it wasn’t no lousy 
dream,” he said miserably. 

He went back to the bed and 
sat down on the edge of it. He 
recalled the headlines in the 
paper. 

“Them lousy Reds,” he whis- 
pered. “They done this, sure as 
hell." 

That made him think a little. 
Everybody was dead, even the 
redhead in the Golden Bubble 
who couldn’t lose. 

“What the hell am I doin’ alive, 
then?” he asked himself. 

There was no answer to that. 
He thought of his mine. The 
Lousy Disappointment, and won- 
dered if, living most of the time 
below the surface as he did, he 
had been protected from some 
sort of purple gas or something

that seemed to have killed off 
everybody else. It could be. Some 
very light gas, maybe, that 
wouldn’t seep below the surface. 

"Aw, for cripe sakes!" he 
grunted disgustedly. 

He dressed and left the room. 
He went downstairs. There was 
the lobby, all soft, quiet carpet- 
ing and soft, quiet furniture and 
soft, quiet drapes. A sheet of 
paper on a writing desk said 
Grand Pachappa. He was in a 
hotel, then. He must have wan- 
dered into it after he left the 
Golden Bubble. 

He carefully avoided looking 
at two well-dressed women who 
sat in lobby chairs, staring off 
into nothing, but he felt their 
presence chillingly. He shivered. 
He made his way outside, the 
purple snow coming down and 
giving his cheeks wet, cold ca- 
resses. He angrily brushed them 
off, but they came down anyway. 
Above the snow, the sky was a 
sodden mass of purplish gray. 

He found a restaurant that was 
open. A few customers sat on the 
stools like statues in a museum. 
All the coffeemakers were on the 
electric stove, but they were dry 
and clean except one that had no 
bottom in it any more and was 
quite discolored. Beneath it, the 
round electric coil still glowed 
faithfully. 

He grabbed up one of the clean 
pots and took it to the metal rinse 



sink and reached for the faucet. 
And then his hand froze. What 
if the water was tainted? He had 
no way of finding out if it didn't 
carry that identifying purplish 
tint. He tried the faucet. It did. 

The milk in the refrigerator 
was three weeks old, of course. 
Gannett ended by opening a bot- 
tle ‘of Pepsi Cola for breakfast. 

The sky stayed leaden, but 
even so there were many things 
apparent now that he hadn’t seen 
the night before. A lack of heavy 
traffic on the streets would seem 
to indicate that what had hap- 
pened — purple gas or whatever — 
had been very late at night; even 
so, traffic accidents were every- 
where. There was one big sedan 
with its front end crushed against 
the First Olympic Bank. There 
was one cop who had died trying 
to tie his right shoe — his fingers 
still clutched the laces. There was 
a doctor (his car had a caduceus 
emblem on the windshield) who 
had just stepped down to the 
street, his bag in his left hand 
and his right hand on. the door, 
ready to slam it shut. He had a 
serious, purposeful look on his 
face that even the falling purple 
snow couldn’t quite eradicate. 

Despite the cold, sweat frosted 
Gannett’s forehead. He made his 
way to a radio and television 
store and kicked in a glass panel 
of the front door. Stepping 
through to the clamor of the sud-

denly aroused night-warning bell, 
he went directly to a TV set and 
turned it on. 

The big screen tube flickered 
after a while and a scratching 
hum came out of the speaker, but 
nothing happened. He tried all 
the channels. Nothing. 

He tuned in a big radio con- 
sole next, going carefully and 
slowly across the dial with a hand 
that shook. Even thpugh the 
night-warning bell was kicking 
up quite a racket, he could tell 
after a moment or two. 

Nothing ... 

T he sky was getting dark as 
Gannett left the store. The 
purple snow still fell. It was then 
•that he noticed for the first time 
the gay street decorations in prep- 
aration for Christmas. Big paper 
bells with plenty of glittering tin- 
sel and electric lamps inside them. 

On the corner of First and Vir- 
ginia, he saw a big iron kettle of 
some Salvation Army Santa. 
Hanging from its metal tripod, it 
looked quite natural, except that 
it was filled with purple snow; 
and the Santa who was supposed 
to ring his little bell was holding 
it stiffly over his head. He and 
the bell were frozen silent. 

There was a large department 
store. Inside, in the show window, 
was a Christmas display that 
would delight the kiddies. There 
was a big Christmas tree trimmed 



wnth every imaginable ornament. 

Beneath the tree, electrically 
activated toy soldiers jerked ro- 
botlike through their precise mil- 
itary designations, their litho- 
graphed faces looking stem and 
very brave. There was a clown 
who did uncounted somersaults; 
a lifelike doll who clapped her 
hands in glee. There was an alu- 
minum bomber with a wing- 
spread of three feet — it was held 
in the air by almost invisible 
wires — and its six propellers 
droned in perfect unison, making 
a brisk little wash that rustled 
the silk of the little doll’s dress. 
And around the base of the tree, 
through valley and over moun- 
tain, into tunnel and over spider- 
web trestle, was a railroad track. 
It should have had busy little 
trains on it, except that it didn’t 
— the trains had been derailed at 
a whistle stop called North Pole. 

Gannett’s eyes twitched. 

The sky grew darker; the pur- 
ple snow continued to fall si- 
lently. Gannett went by the Ma- 
sonic Lodge, the YMCA. and 
crossed the little stone bridge 
over the frozen Truckee River. 
He came to the heavy gray stone 
building of First Community 
Church. 

He stopped in front of the 
church and stared at it. It was a 
solid, respectable-looking build- 
ing. It was a very nice thing, in- 
deed, to have here in Reno.

NOT A CREATURE WAS STIRRING 



“Christmas Eve,” Gannett 
whispered through cold lips. 
“This is Christmas Eve!” 

He went up six purple-snow- 
covered stone steps. He reached 
the top where the stone steps 
ended and where the big square 
stone slab was, that slab where 
the minister stands when the 
weather is fair, and shakes hands 
with the congregation after the 
service. 

Somewhere above, in the 
steeple, bells struck off the hour 
of eight. A timing device did that. 
Many churches had such timing 
devices to save labor. And as 
though that were a signal, a loud- 
speaker, attached way up on the 
spire especially for this festive 



season, began to growl out pre- 
paratory scratching noises, like 
a big metal monster clearing its 
throat. 

Gannett pulled on the wrought 
brass handles of the closed oaken 
door. The door didn’t budge. He 
grabbed the handles in both 
hands and braced his feet. He 
pulled hard. The door was locked. 

“God,” he whispered hoarsely. 
“God, this is me. I gotta get in, 
God. God, listen, I gotta get in!” 

High above, in the steeple, the 
loudspeaker was finally ready 
with a cheerful little carol. 

“God Rest Ye Merry, Gentle- 
men!” the voices of a dead choir 
roared out upon the silent city.

Naiuralty tk» amputee wanted to stay out of 
his body for good . but you can't blame the 
man of the future for wanting to escape it!

Delano, Conn. 

28th Feb. 

Messrs. Thompson & Handett 
A ttorneys-at-Lavf 
512 Gable Street * 
Philadelphia, Pa. 

Gentlemen: 

In response to your request, we 
have conducted a thorough ex- 
amination of our patient, Stephen 
Dallboy, and have established his 
identity beyond legal question. 



Attested documents in support 
of this are enclosed, and dispose 
entirely of his claim to the Ter- 
ence Molton property. 

At the same time ^we admit 
we are bewildered. The condition 
of the_ patient has altered quite 
radically since our last examina- 
tion, when he was indubitably 
feebleminded. Indeed, but for this 
obsession that he is Terence Mol- 
ton, which he maintains with 
complete consistency, we should 



PIlLAt TO POST 



T31 



ftow classify him as normal. In 
view of the obsession and the re- 
markable assertions with which 
he supports it,* we feel that he 
should remain here under obser- 
vation, which may give us the 
opportunity of dispelling the 
whole fantasy system — and at the 
same time of clearing up several 
points we find puzzling. 

In order that you may more 
clearly understand the situation, 
we are enclosing a copy of a 
statement written by the patient, 
which we suggest you study be- 
fore reading our concluding re- 
marks. ^ 

STATEMENT BY TERENCE MOLTON 

1 KNOW this is difficult to 
believe. In fact, when the 
thing first happened, I didn’t 
believe it myself. I figured it was 
just a stage, maybe, in the de- 
teriorating process. I’ve had 
enough dope long enough to play 
hell with my nervous system — 
yet the funny thing was how real 
it seemed right away. Still, I 
thought, everything would seem 
real to De Quincey when he was 
coked up, *and to Coleridge, too. 

A damsel with a dulcimer 
In a vision once I saw . • • 

Vision is a poor word — all 
quality and no quantity. How 
strong was that vision? Could he 



put out his hand and touch the 
babe? He heard her sing, but did 
she sp>eak to him? And did he 
find himself a new man, free from 
pain? I guess even the milk and 
honey of Paradise are relative. 
Some would yearn for a kind of' 
celestial Hollywood, but just hav- 
ing no pain and being complete 
would have been Paradise enow 
for me. 

It had been Just over four years 
since that mine had got me — four 
years, nine operations and more 
to come. Interesting for the doc- 
tors, no doubt, but it had turned 
me into just a hulk in a wheel- 
chair, with only half of one leg 
and no feet at all under the 
blanket. 

“Go easy on the dope,” the 
surgeon had warned me. 

“What’ll happen if I don’t?” I 
asked. 

“You don’t want to become an 
addict, do you?” 

.That was funny. If they’d given 
me anything else to stop the pain, 

I wouldn’t have wanted to risk^ 
addiction. But they didn’t have 
anything else. And if they had 
refused me dope. I’d have killed 
myself. They knew that. So the 
nurses gave it to me, though al- 
ways trying to talk me into cut- 
ting down. 

And there was Sally. She used 
to come to the hospital every 
visiting day, bringing me candy 
or books and cigarettes, and lean- 



132 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ing over the bed to kiss me, with 
that gentle little smile that needs 
only a word to turn it into hope- 
less weeping. 

I finally said, “Look, Sally, this 
isn’t doing you or me any good. 
The sample I showed you was a 
healthy young guy. What you’d 
get now isn’t anything like the 
sample. Why don’t you go find 
somebody who is?” 

Poor kid, it nearly broke her 
up. She argued out of mistaken 
loyalty, but I didn’t want her on 
my conscience. They tell me her 
husband’s a good joe and the 
baby is cute. Some of the nurses 
and Gray Ladies thought I was 
brooding about it. The fact is this 
is how I figure it should be. 

All the same, when every 
woman you see ia kind to you — 
in about the same way she would 
be to a sick dog — 

Oh, well, there was always the 
dope. 

And then, when I wasn’t ex- 
pecting anything at all except 
more p>ain and misery, there was 
this . this vision. 

tipHE day had been a rotten one 
for me. My right leg and my 
left foot were hurting a lot. But 
most of the right leg had been 
taken off and the left foot had 
bad to go, too, a little later, so 
nothing could be done about it 
except to reach for the bottle. 

Maybe I took a little more than 



usual, but for all the difference it 
made to anyone else, I might as 
well be doped to the' eyes all the 
time. 

I lay back, feeling the pain 
fade out. I seemed to float 
smoothly and 'gently up and 
away, disembodied, filled with a 
surging lighttjess. The pain must 
have made me pretty tired, I 
guess, because I could feel my- 
self falling asleep before I’d even 
begun to enjoy the lack of it . 

When I opened my eyes, there, 
in front of me, was the vision of 
the damsel. She didn’t have a 
dulcimer, and she certainly did 
not look Abyssinian, but she was 
singing, very quietly. It was an 
odd* song, and for all 1 knew it 
might have been about Mount 
Abora, because I couldn’t under- 
stand a word of it. 

We were in a room — well, yes, 
it was a room, though it was more 
like being inside a bubble. It was 
all cool green, with a soft opal- 
escence, and the walls curving up 
so you couldn’t tell where they 
became ceiling. There were two 
arched openings in the sides. 
Through them were tree tops and 
a patch of blue sky. Close to one 
of them, the girl was fiddling 
with something I couldn’t see. 

She glanced toward me, and 
saw that my eyes were open. She 
turned and said something that 
sounded like a question, but it 
meant absolutely nothing to me.

I just looked back at her. 

She was worth looking at. A 
tall, beautifully proportioned fig- 
ure, with brown hair caught back 
by a ribbon. The material of her 
4ress was diaphanous, yet there 
was a vast amount- of it, arranged 
in multitudes of cunning folds. It 
made me think of the pre-Ra- 
phaelites’ versions of the classical. 
It must have been cobweb-light, 
for as she moved it swirled and 
hesitated in mid-air. The result 
was like that frozen high-wind 
effect so popular in late Greek 
sculpture. 

When I did not reply, she 
frowned a little and repeated her 
question. I did not pay a lot of 
attention to the words. As a mat- 
ter of fact, I was thinking: “Well, 
that’s that; I’ve had it,’’ and de- 
ciding that I was now in some 
kind of anteroom to Heaven, or — 
well, anyway, an anteroom. I 
wasn’t scared, not even greatly 
surprised. I remember feeling, 
“That’s a nasty experience fin- 
ished with,” and wondering a 
little that the prelude to eternity 
should resemble certain Victorian 
schools of painting. 

When I still did not answer, 
her dark eyes widened a little. 
There was a look of wonder in 
them, perhaps a slight tinge of 
alarm, as she came toward me. 
Slowly she said: 
j .1 “You— are — not— Hymorell?” 

[ Her English had a strange ac- 

134 



cent, and anyway I did not know 
what hymorell meant. I might be, 
or I might not. She went on: 

“Not — ^Hymorell? Some — other 
— ^person?” ^ 

It sounded as if Hymorell was 
a name. 

“I’m Terry,” I told her. “Terry 
Molton.” 

There was a block of the green 
stuff near me. It looked hard and 
cold, but she sat down on it and 
stared at me, her expression half- 
disbelief mixed with surprise. 

By this time I was beginning 
to discover myself. I was lying 
on a remarkably soft couch with 
some kind of blanket over me 
that smoothed itself out when I 
turned, instead of getting bunched 
under me. I don’t know how they 
got it to do that. Jt moved all the 
way down what should have been 
my right leg — including what 
would have been my right foot, if 
I’d had one. 

I sat up suddenly, feeling my 
legs, both of them. There wasn’t 
any pain. But there were two legs 
and two feet! 

Then I did something I hadn’t 
let myself do in years — I burst 
into teajrs. 

S HE began speaking to me in 
uncertain, foreign English, and 
I remember wondering how there 
could be a language problem at 
the gates of Paradise. But I was 
more concerned with myself. I 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



threw back the blanket and sat 
staring at the legs. 

“They’re not mine,” I said 
dazedly, and then looked at the 
hand with which I felt them. 
“That’s not mine, either.” 

“Of — course,” she said hesi- 
tantly. “How could — they be?” 

-T can wriggle the toes and 
bend the fingers, so what’s the 
difference? You can’t expect any 
sense in a dream.” 

I don’t recall what we talked 
about then. I suppose I was too 
excited and bewildered to take it 
all in. I do know she told me her 
name — Clytassamine-c-and I re- 
member thinking it was a real 
mouthful. But what seemed more 
important was to swing the legs 
over the side and stand, on them. 

For the first time since that 
mine got me, I stood! 

There’s no sense going into a 
lot of detail. What I might say 
would be about as informative as 
a Trobrian Islander’s first im- 
pression of New York. I just had 
to take most things on trust, the 
way he would. 

“You need — the word is — gar- 
ments, is it not?” she asked. 

I certainly did. Staying in a 
hospital for four years, you get 
to think of women as nurses, so 
I hadn’t been aware of it. She 
didn’t seem concerned and that 
helped me not to be. She stood 
me in a little cubicle that must 
have taken my measurements 



somehow, because clothes came 
out of a slot in the wall. There 
was a whale of a lot of it, and 
not a seam to be seen. Pretty 
filmy and ridiculous, it seemed to 
me, but it satisfied her, so I let 
her help me put it on. When I 
was dressed, she opened the door. 

“You mean I have to go out in 
this damned nightgown?” I de- 
manded. 

“We all — dress — this way,” she 
said. “In other garments — people 
— notify.” 

It stopped me for a moment. 
“Notice?” I asked. 

“Notice,” she corrected her- 
self without self-consciousness. 
“Come.” 

We emerged into a great hall 
built of the same green compo- 
sition. I figured that if Manhat- 
tan were to sink into the Hudson 
River, Grand Central Station 
under water would look about the 
way this place did. 

A number of people were 
around, none of them hurrying. 
All their clothes were of the filmy 
stuff, but as far as color and de- 
sign went, it was apparently each 
to his own taste. There was a 
deadening of sound that I found 
oppressive, perhaps because you’d 
normally expect an echo in a huge 
place like this, whereas our slip- 
pers were silent on the floor and 
the quiet voices made only a soft 
hum. 

Clytassamine led the way to a

row of double seats set against the 
wall and pointed to an end seat. 
I sat down experimentally in it, 
and she sat confidently beside me. 

The seat rose about four inches 
from the floor and began to drift 
across the room. 

“Are you sure this is all right?” 
I asked, worried. 

“This is — conveyance. You — 
traveled? — went? — only by foot 
and by — animal?” 

I looked at her in astonish- 
ment. “Are you kidding? I’ve 
been in cars, planes, tanks, ships, 
trains.” 

Did she think I came from a 
farm? 

I N the middle of the great room, 
we turned and slid silently to- 
ward an arch at the far end, and 
out into the open air. We rose 
until we had an elevation of a 
yard or so above the ground, 
while, from the shallow platform 
to which the seat was attached, 
a curved windshield came up to 
cover us. 

We accelerated to twenty -five 
miles an hour. I’d say, and swept 
smoothly across parklike coun- 
try, traveling a course between 
occasional trees and clumps of 
bushes. I suppose she was navi- 
gating the contraption in some 
way, but I couldn’t see how. In 
every way except speed, it was a 
better way to travel than any- 
thing else I’ve known — more in 



the magic carpet class. 

It was a strange journey; some- 
thing over an hour. I imagine, 
and in all that time we never 
crossed nor even saw a road, 
though twice I noticed paths that 
didn’t seem to be used much. 

“No cultivated fields or gar- 
dens?” I asked. 

She looked blank. I tried to ex- 
plain in terms of food, but that 
didn’t clear anything up. She 
seemed completely unfamiliar 
with the idea of vegetables or 
grains, which increased my feel- 
ing that I was in a spirit world 
where we were supposed to live 
on ambrosia. There were deerlike 
creatures that paid us no atten- 
tion. I was afraid to ask if they 
were raised as meat animals. 

The only signs of humanity 
were occasional large buildings to 
be seen above the trees, but they 
weren’t on our course. The trees 
were, though. Every time we came 
to a section of woods, I tried to 
pull back on a nonexistent stick 
and hop over it, but apparently 
the contraption didn’t work that 
way, for we always went around 
and not over obstacles. 

“Are you just showing me the 
sights, or are we heading any- 
where in particular?” I wanted 
to know. 

Both concepts gave her trouble. 
“All — things are sights.” she said, 
after I’d done my best to ex- 
plain. “If nowhere to go, stay— 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



home. With you it is — other- 
wise?” 

She should have seen weekend 
traffic. I didn’t describe it because 
by that time I began to catch 
glimpses of a building on a hill 
ahead of us. 

I’m no architect and I can’t 
say this part showed this kind of 
influence and that part something 
else. It wouldn’t have made much 
difference if I could have, though, 
because every building I had ever 
seen had been based on some 
geometrical pattern. This looked 
more as if it had grown. Bushes 
came close up against it, and a 
lot were even sprouting on top. 
The only reason I was sure it was 
a building was that it couldn’t be 
anything natural. 

As we got nearer, I became 
still more bewildered. I could see 
now that what I had thought to 
be small bushes were full-grown 
trees— even those on top of it. 
The place was unbelievably im- 
mense. Then, in the midst of my 
amazement, I remembered my- 
self, and smiled. The dope dream 
was running true to form: 

It was a miracle of rare device, 

A sunny pleasure dome with 
caves of ice. 

But when we arrived, it wasn’t 
at all like that. It rose before us 
like: a cleverly designed artificial 
mountain. We swept into it 
through an entrance sixty yards 



wide' and several hundred feet 
high, to emerge into a central hall 
of staggering size. 

There was no suggestion what- 
ever of “pleasure dome,” though 
something of the “caves of ice” 
feeling came from the translu- 
cency of the pearly walls. 

IV/rORE slowly, and seeming to 
drift like a feather in an air 
current, we floated across the 
place. There were a few men and 
women walking in a leisurely 
fashion, and a few chairs gliding 
as our own did. 

“A kind of railroad terminal?” 
I asked. 

She didn’t get it, nor did air- 
field, bus station or waiting room 
mean anything to her. I gave up 
and watched us go through the 
enormous hall and through a 
dozen or more passages and lesser 
halls, wondering how she could 
find her way. But I wasn’t too 
surprised — it always puzzles me 
how people can get around in 
cities I don’t know, especially 
where the streets have names in- 
stead of numbers. 

We came to a relatively small 
hall, where a dozen or so men 
and women were gathered, ap- 
parently waiting for us. There the 
chair stopped. It lowered the few 
inches to the floor and we got out, 
whereupon, in a way that could 
happen only in a dream, it lifted 
just clear and drifted away to the

wall, as if parking itself. 

Clytassamine spoke to the 
group of people and indicated me. 
They nodded gravely in my di- 
rection. It seemed the polite thing 
to do, so I nodded back. Then, 
with her as interpreter, a kind of 
catechism began. 

I think it was during that 
questioning that I really began to 
feel there was something seriously 
wrong with my dream. They 
wanted to know my name, where 
I came from, what I did, what 
had happened to my legs and 
why, what war and hospital 
meant, and a great deal more, 
and the answers I gave made 
them frown baffledly and pause 
now and then to confer. 

It was all very logical and de- 
tailed, which was wrong. Dreams 
— my dreams, at any rate — have 
a more cinematic quality. They 
do not proceed in smooth se- 
quence, but jump suddenly from 
one scene to another, as though 
directed by an erratic and im- 
patient psychotic. But this was 
not at all like that. I was acutely 
aware of what was going on, both 
physically and mentally. 

At last Clytassamine said, 
"They wish you — learn — lan- 
guage. More easy to — speak.” 

"That’s going to take a long 
while,” I said, because not a sin- 
gle word that any of them had 
spoken bad been familiar to me. 

"No. Few tblana.” 



"How much?” 

"Quarter day,” she explained. 

"A lousy linguist like me? I 
wasn’t even able to learn pig- 
Latin!” 

She didn’t answer or argue. She 
gave me some food — a box of 
things that looked like candy and 
tasted good. They weren’t sweet 
or very big, but only a few took 
care of my hunger. 

"Now — sleep,” said Clytassa- 
mine, pointing to a cold, un- 
friendly-looking block of the 
green stuff. 

I got on it and found that it 
was neither chilly nor hard. I lay 
there worriedly, wondering if this 
was the end of the dream and I 
would wake up to find myself 
back in my own bed, with the old 
pain where my legs ought to be. 
But I didn’t wonder long. There 
must have been some drug in the 
food. 

W HEN I awoke, I was still 
there. Hanging over me was 
a kind of canopy of rose-colored 
metal which had not been there 
before. It was — I’m going to give 
up trying to describe things; there 
was too much basic unfamiliarity. 
What would an ancient Egyptian 
know of a telephone by looking at 
it? What would a Roman or a 
Greek make of a jet plane or a 
radio. And as for TV — !

ple things, if you saw a slab of

chocolate for the first time, you 
might think it was for mending 
shoes, lighting the fire, or building 
houses. About the last use you’d 
guess for it would be eating — 
and, when you did find out, you’d 
most likely try eating soap be- 
cause the texture was similar and 
the color more attractive. 

That’s the way it was with me. 
You grownup with your condi- 
tioning complete. You look at a 
machine and you don’t have to 
say to yourself, “Ah, that works 
by steam, or gasoline, or elec- 
tricity,” because you know, and 
you generally have a good idea 
of what the machine does with- 
out having to think about it. 

But nearly all of what I was 
seeing now was foreign to me. I 
had no place to start. Not under- 
standing what might cut or burn 
me if I touched it, I was scared 
of everything — just like a child 
or an aborigine. Naturally, I 
floundered around with wild 
guesses, but mostly they had to 
remain just that. 

I guessed now that^tKe canopy 
was part of a hypnotic teaching 
machine, something like those the 
Navy tried to use to teach Morse 
Code. I guessed that, however, 
because I found I could now un- 
derstand what the people were 
saying — some of it, at least — but 
the concepts behind the language 
were totally alien. I kne\y only 
what I could translate directly. 



The word “thlana” that Clytas- 
samine had used, for example, I 
now knew was a measure of time 
— one hour and twelve minutes, 
making twenty thlana to the day 
— so I’d been out about five 
thlana, almost six hours. “Dool” 
was electricity, but “laythal” 
meant nothing to me. I knew it 
was some form of power and that 
was all, not where it came from 
or what it did, though Clytassa- 
mine did hef best to explain: 
“The mizmo is changed into 
frengra, and that produces lay- 
thal. But it has to be senaced, of 
course, before it can be baxtoa.** 
It wasn’t her fault. You try, 
explaining how coal and water 
are converted into electricity 
without using terms that are un- 
familiar to an illiterate, gnd lay- 
thal, as I understood it, was even 
more complicated. But these dif- 
ficulties had the effect of en- 
hancing the dreamlike quality. 
The utter blankness of certain 
words or ideas which kept crop- 
ping up, like the dead keys of an 
old piano, began to get me down. 

“■p'NOUGH, Clytassamlne,” a 
man said, when my distress 
must have begun to show pretty 
plainly. “Take him away and 
look after him.” 

The relief was almost physical 
as I sat down beside her again on 
one of the flying -seats-. I sighed 
and relaxed finally as it floated

vs back once more into the open 
•ir. 

E ven before I understood any- 
thing about this unfamiliar 
world, I was somewhat awed by 
Clytassamine’s power of mental 
adjustment. It seemed to me that 
it must be a frightening experi- 
ence, discovering that a person 
you have known for a long while 
has without warning become a 
perfect stranger — with, maybe, 
unpredictable reactions. Yet she 
showed no alarm, and only oc- 
casionally made the slip of call- 
ing me Hymorell. 

I realized why somebody re- 
covering consciousness usually 
demands first of all, “Where am 
1?” I wanted to know that very 
much; without that information, 
1 didn’t seem to be able to get 
my thinking started proirerly. 
There was no fixed point to begin 
from. 

When we were back in the 
green room again, I began to ask 
questions. She looked at me 
doubtfully. 

“You should rest. Simply relax 
and don’t worry. We will look 
after you. If I were to try to ex- 
plain, I would bewilder you more.” 
“You couldn’t,.^ I told her. 
•■Nothing could. I’ve got to the 
stage where I can’t pretend this 
is a dream any longer. I’ve got 
to get some kind of orientation 
«r go crazy.” 



She looked at me closely again, 
and then nodded. “Very well. But 
where am I to begin? What is 
most urgent?” 

"I want to know where I am, 
who I am, and how it happened.” 
“As to who you are, you know 
that. You told me you are Terry 
Molton.” 

“But this — ” I slapped my left 
thigh — “this isn’t Terry Molton.” 
“Temporarily it is,” she said. 
“It was Hymorell’s body, but 
now all the qualities that make 
it individual — mentality, person- 
ality, character — •. are yours. 
Therefore, it is Terry Molton’s 
body.” 

“And what happ>ened to Hyr 
morel 1?” 

“He has transferred to what 
was your body.” 

“Then he’s made a damn bad 
deal," I told her. I thought for a 
moment. “That doesn’t make 
sense. I’m not the same as I was 
before I was shot up. Physical 
differences make mental differ- 
ences. Injuries and dope changed 
mine to some extent — if they’d 
done it more. I’d have a com- 
pletely different personality.” 
“Who told you that?” 
■‘Common sense.” 

“And your scientists postulate 
no constant? Surely there must" 
be some constant factor not af- 
fected by changes. And if there 
is that factor, may it not be a 
cause rather than an effect?”

“As I understand it, it’s simply 
a matter of balance — physical and 
psychological forces held in equi- 
librium.” 

“Then you don’t understand 
it,” she told me. 

I decided to drop that angle 
for the moment. 

“What is this place?” I asked. 

“The building is called Ca- 
thalu.” 

“No, I mean where is it? Is it 
on Earth? It looks like Earth, 
but nowhere that I ever heard 
of.” 

“Of course it’s Earth. Where 
else would it be? But it’s in a 
different salany.” 

¥ WAS up against another of 
those blank words once more. 
Salany meant absolutely nothing 
to me. 

“Do you mean it’s in a dif- 
ferent — ?” I began, and then 
stopped, baffled. There didn’t 
seem to be a word in her language 
for “time,” at least in the sense 
I meant. 

“I told you it would be be- 
wildering,” she said. “You think 
differently. In terms of old think- 
ing — as near as I can understand 
it — you come from one end of the 
human race. Now you are at the 
other.” 

“But I don’t," I protested. 
“There were some twenty million 
years of human evolution before 
me. 



“Oh, that!” she said, airily dis- 
missing those twenty million 
years with a wave of her hand. 

“Well, at least,” I went on des- 
perately, “you can tell me how 
I got here.” 

“Roughly, yes. It is an experi- 
ment of Hymorell’s. He has been 
trying for a long time — ” in this 
straightforward sense, I noticed, 
there did seem to be a word for 
time— “but now he has made a 
new approach. A successful one 
at last. Several times before, he 
has almost done it, but the trans- 
fer did not hold. His most suc- 
cessful attempts were about three 
generations ago. He — ” 

“I beg your pardon?” I said. 

She looked up questioningly. 
“Yes?” 

“I thought you said he tried 
three generations ago.” 

“I did.” 

I got up from the block I’d 
been sitting on and looked out 
of the arched windows. It was a 
peaceful, sunny, normal-looking 
day out there. 

“Maybe you were right — I’d 
better rest,” I said. 

“That’s sensible,” she agreed. 
“Don’t bother your head about 
the hows and whys. After all, 
you won’t be here long.” 

“You mean, I’ll be going back 
— to be as I was?' 

She nodded. 

I could feel my body under the 
unfamiliar robe. It was a good

141 



body, strong, well-kept, lithe, 
whole, and there was no pain in 
it. 

“No,” I said. “I don’t know 
where I am, or what I am now, 
but one thing I do know — I’m not 
going back to that hell.” 

She looked at me and shook 
her head pityingly. 

f I ■'HE next day, after we had 
fed on more of the candies 
that were not candies, and drunk 
an elusive-flavored milky stuff, 
she led the way into the hall and 
toward the- chairs. 

I stopped. “Can’t we walk? 
It’s a long time since I was able 
to.” 

“Why, yes, of course,” she said, 
and we turned toward the door- 
way. Several people spoke to her, 
and one or two of them to me. 
There was curiosity in their eyes, 
but their manners were kindly, as 
though to set a stranger at ease. 
It was evident that they knew I 
was not Hymorell, yet they were 
too polite to mention it. 

Outside, we walked across 
rough grass and found a path 
leading through a thicket. It was 
quiet, peaceful, Arcadianly beau- 
tiful. To me, feeling the ground 
beneath my feet as something 
precious, everything had the 
freshness of Spring. The blood 
livened in my veins in a way that 
I had forgotten. 

“Wherever it is, it’s lovely," I 



said, glancing around. 

We walked on in silence for a 
while, until my curiosity came 
back. 

“What did you mean by “the 
other end of the human race?’ " 
I asked her. 

“Just that. We think we are 
coming to the end, finishing. We 
are practically sure of it, though 
there is always chance.” 

“I have never seen anyone 
more healthy or more beautiful," 
I said, looking straight at her. 

She smiled. “It is a nice body. 
My best, I think.” 

For the moment, 1 ignored that 
baffling addition. “Then what is 
happening? Is it infertility?” 
“No. There are not a great 
many children, but that is more 
a result than a cause. It is that 
something in us is failing to re- 
produce — the thing that makes 
us human instead of merely ani- 
mal. We call it malukos.” 

The word translated as some- 
thing like a spirit or a soul, yet 
not quite either. 

“Then the children — ?" 

“Nearly all of them lack that. 
They are — feebleminded. If 
things go on this way, they will 
all be like that one day, and then 
it will be over.” 

I pondered that, feeling that I 
was back in the dream again. 

“I don’t know,” she went on. 
“One doesn’t think of the salany 
arithmetically, though there is 



142

the perimetrical approach.” 

I couldn’t make sense of that. 
“Aren’t there any records?” 

“Oh, yes. That is how Hy- 
morell and I learned your lan- 
guage. But there are very big 
gaps. Five times, at least, the race 
all but destroyed itself. There are 
thousands of years missing from 
the records at different periods.” 
“And how long is it going to 
be before it is all finished?” I 
asked. 

“We don’t know that, either. 
Our task is to prolong it because 
there is always chance. It may 
happen that the intelligence fac- 
tors will become strong again.” 
“How do you mean, ‘prolong 
it?’ Prolong your own lives?” 
“We transfer. When a body be- 
gins to fail, or when it is about 
fifty years old and getting past 
its best, we choose one of the 
feebleminded and transfer to 
that. This,” she added, holding 
up her perfect hand and studying 
it. “is my fourteenth body. It’s a 
very nice one.” 

I agreed. “But do you mean 
you can go on and on transfer- 
ring?” 

“As long as there are bodies to 
transfer to.” 

“But — but that’s immortality.” 
“No,” she said, scornfully, 
“nothing like it. It is just pro- 
longation. Someday, sooner or 
later, there’ll . be an accident. 
That’s mathematically inevitable. 



It might have been a hundred 
years ago, or it might be tomor- 
row — ” 

“Or a thousand years hence?” I 
suggested. 

“Exactly, but one day it will 
come.” 

I did not for a moment doubt 
that she was telling me the truth, 
for by this time I was prepared 
for any fantastic situation. All the 
same, I revolted against it. I had 
an instinctive sense of disap- 
proval — prejudice, of course, the 
same prejudice which made me 
disapprove of the- soft, flowing 
garments and the soft, easy man- 
ner of life. I couldn’t help feeling 
that the process she spoke of was 
allied to cannibalism in some 
symbolic fashion. 

S HE must have read my ex- 
pression, for she said, explain- 
ing, not excusing: “This body 
wasn’t any good to the girl who 
had it. T don’t suppose she was 
really even conscious of it. It was 
being wasted. I shall look after 
it. I shall have children. Some of 
them may be normal human chil- 
dren. When they grow old, they 
will be able to transfer. The urge 
to survival still exists, you see. 
Something may happen; someone 
may make a discovery to save us 
even now.” ' 

“And the girl who had this 
body? What happened to her?” 
“Well, she had very little be-

yond a few instincts. What there 
was changed places with me.” 
“Into a body aged fifty? Losing 
thirty years of life?” 

“Can you call it loss when she 
was incapable of using it?” 

I did not reply to that, for a 
thought had struck me. “So that’s 
what Hymorell was working on! 
He was trying to transfer normal 
personalities from the past into 
feebleminded bodies! That’s it, 
isn’t it?” 

She looked at me steadily. 
“He’s been successful at last. It 
is a real transference this time.” 

I was strangely unsurprised. I 
suppose I had been working up 
to the realization before it ac- 
tually came. But there was a lot 
I wanted to know about the why 
and how as I was affected. I 
asked her for more details. 

“Hymorell wanted to get as far 
as possible,” she told me. “The 
limit was the point where he 
could be sure of assembling the 
parts to make an instrument that 
would get him back here. If he 
went too far in history, certain 
essential metals would not be 
known, instruments would be in- 
accurate, electric power' unavail- 
able. In that case, it might take 
him years to build the instru- 
ment, if he could do it at all. 
The use of nuclear fission was the 
line he decided to draw. Further 
away than that, he thought, 
might be dangerous. - ' 



“Then he had to find a contact. 
It had to be a subject where the 
integration was not good — where 
there was a lesion weakening the 
attachment of the personality to 
the physical shape. When we per- 
form the operation, we can pre- 
pare the subject, which is easy. 
But he had to find one already 
in a suitable state. Unfortunately, 
those he could find were nearly 
all on the point of death, but he 
found you at last and then he had 
to study the strength of your tie 
to life. He was puzzled because 
it fluctuated a great deal.” 

“That would be the dope,” I 
suggested: 

“Possibly. Anyway, he worked 
out a rhythmic incidence of 
lesion, and then tried. This is the 
result.” 

“I see,” I said. “How long did 
he figure it would take him to 
build the instrument for his re- 
turn?” 

“He couldn’t tell that. It de- 
pends on his facilities for as- 
sembling materials.” 

“Then it’s going to take him 
quite a while. I’d say. A legless 
cripple wasn’t a convenient sub- 
ject to choose, from that point of 
view.” 

“But he’ll do it.” 

“Not if I can help it,” I told 
her. 

She shook her head. “Once you 
have transferred, you never can 
have the perfect integration you 



144 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




had with your own body. If at 
no other time, he will put on 
more power and get at you when 
you’re sleeping.” 

“We’ll see about that,” I said. 

Afterward, I saw the instru- 
ment that Jlymorell had used for 
the transfer. It was not large. In 
appearance, it was little more 
than a liquid-filled lens mounted 
upon a box the size of a portable 
typewriter, from which protruded 



two polished metal handles. But 
within the box there was enough 
intricacy of wiring, tubes, and 
strange gadgets to fill me with 
great satisfaction. No one, I said 
to myself, was going to knock a 
thing like that together in a few 
days, or even a few weeks.

istic was, at first, restful. After 
that came periods when I wanted 
to go wild and break up some- 
thing just for the diversion. 

Clytassamine took me here and 
there in the great green building. 
There were concerts at which I 
understood not a thing. I sat 
■there, bored and musing to my- 
self while around me the audience 
went into an intellectual trance, 
finding something in the strange 
scales and queerer harmonies 
that was utterly beyond my per- 
ception. 

And there was one hall where 
colors played on a large fluores- 
cent screen. They seemed to be 
projected from the spectators 
themselves in some incompre- 
hensible way. Everybody but me 
enjoyed it. You could feel that. 
And now and then, for no reason 
that I could perceive, they 
would all sigh or laugh together. 
Nevertheless, I thought some of 
the effects very pretty, and said 
so. By the way it was received, 
t it was the wrong thing to say. 

Only in the performances of 
three-dimensionally projected 
plays was I occasionally able to 
follow the action for a while — 
and when I thought I could, it 
usually shook me badly. 

Clytassamine became impa- 
tient with my comments. “How 
can you expect to feel when you 
measure civilized behavior by 
primitive taboos?” she asked. 



She took me to a museum. It 
was not like any I had thought of, 
being mostly a collection of in- 
struments projecting sound or 
images, or both, according to 
selection. I saw some horrible 
things. We went back, back, and 
still further back in time. I 
•wanted to see or hear something 
of my own time. 

“There’s only sound,” she said. 

“All right,” I told her. “Let’s 
have music.” 

She worked at the keyboard of 
the machine. Into that great hall, 
a familiar sound stole softly and 
mournfully. As I listened to it, I 
had a sense of emptiness and vast 
desolation. Memories flooded 
back as if the old world — not, 
oddly enough, the o«e I had left, 
but that in which I was a child — • 
were suddenly around me. A 
wave of sentimentality, of over- 
whelming self-pity and nostalgia 
for all the hopes and joys and 
childhood that had vanished ut- 
terly engulfed me, and the tears 
streamed down my face. 

I did not go to that museum 
again. And the music which con- 
jured a whole world up from the 
aged dust? No, it was not a Beet- 
hoven symphony, nor a Mozart 
concerto. 

It was The Old Folks At Home, 

“1^0 you never work? Does 
nobody work?” I asked 
Clytassamine.

“Oh, yes, if we want to.** 

“But what aLout the unpleas- 
ant things — the things that must 
be done?” 

“What things?” she asked, puz- 
zled. 

“Well, growing food, providing 
power, making clothes, building, 
transportation . 

She looked surprised. 

“Why, naturally, the machines 
do all that. You wouldn’t expect 
men to do those things.” 

“But who looks after the ma- 
chines and keeps them in order?” 
“Themselves, of course. A 
mechanism that couldn’t main- 
tain itself wouldn’t be a machine. 
It would be just a form of tool.” 
“Oh,” I said. And I supposed 
it would, though the thought was 
new to me. 

“Do you mean to say,” I went 
on, “that for your fourteen gen- 
erations — some four hundred 
years or so— you’ve done nothing 
but this?” 

“Well, I’ve had quite a lot of 
babies. Three of them were quite 
normal. And I’ve worked on 
eugenic research from time to 
time. Almost everybody does 
when he thinks he’s got a lead.” 
“But how can you stand it, 
just going on and on?” 

“It is not easy sometimes and 
some of us do give up, but that 
is a crime, because there is -al- 
ways chance. And it’s not quite 
so monotonous as you think. 



Each transfer makes a difference. 
You feel as if the world had be- 
come a different place then. Even 
in one body, tastes can change 
quite a lot in one lifetime, and 
they inevitably differ between 
bodies. But you are the same 
person, yet you are young again. 
You’re hopeful, the world looks 
brighter, you think you’ll be 
wiser this time. And then you 
fall in love again, just as sweetly 
and foolishly as before. It’s won- 
derful, like a rebirth. You can

“I can guess,” I said. “I was

to know. “What happened to

vast and destructive global war?” 
“It just died, the same as all 
the early civilizations. Nothing 
spectacular.” 

I thought of my world, its in- 
tricacies and complexities, the 
mastery of distance and speed, 
the progress of science. 

“Just died?” I repeated. “It 
can't have. There must have been 
something that broke it up.” 

“Oh, no. The passion for order 
is a manifestation of the deep de- 
sire for security. The desire is 
natural, but the attainment is 
fatal. There was the means to 
produce a static world, which 
was achieved. When the need for 
adaptation arose, it found itself 
unable to adapt. It inertly died 
of discouragement. That hap- 
pened to many primitive peo- 
ples before.” 

She had no reason to lie, but 
it was hard to believe. 

“We hoped for so much,” I 
protested. “Everything was open- 
ing before us. We were learning. 
We were going to reach out to 
other planets and beyond.” 

“Ingenious you certainly were, 
but each new discovery was a toy. 
You never considered its true 
worth. And you were a greedy, 
childishly aggressive people. You 
developed science without devel- 
oping philosophy. Philosophy 
without science is fruitless spec- 
ulation, likely to degenerate into 
superstition and ignorant quib- 



bling. But science without phil- 
osophy is equally fruitless re- 
search that leads to pedantry, 
stasis, dogma.” 

“That’s rather hard on us. We 
had very complex problems.” 
“Mostly concerned with preser- 
vation of forms and habits. It 
never seems to have occurred to 
you that in Nature life is growth, 
and preservation is an accident. 
What is preserved in the rocks or 
in ice is only the image of life, 
but you were always regarding 
local taboos as eternal verities.” 
My mind switched suddenly to 
my present situation. “But sup- 
pose I were to go back and tell 
them what is going to happen. It 
would alter things. Doesn’t that 
show I’m not going back?" 

She smiled. “You think they 
would listen to you while they 
neglect philosophy, Terry?” 
“Anyway,” I said, “I don’t in- 
tend to go back. I don’t like your 
world. I think it is decadent, and 
in many ways immoral, but at 
least I am a whole human being 
here.” 

She shook her head. “So young, 
Terry. So sure of right and wrong. 
It’s rather sweet.” 

“It’s not sweet at all,” I said, 
brusquely. “There have to be 
standards. Without standards, 
where are you?” 

“Well, where? Where’s a tree, 
or a flower, or a butterfly?” 
“We’re more than plants.”

“What do you do about oppos- 
ing standards? Go gloriously to 
war?" . 

I dropped that. 

“Did we get to other planets?” 

I asked. 

but the next civilization 
did. They found Mars too old, 
Venus too young. You had a 
dream of men spreading out over 
the Universe; I’m afraid that 
never happened, though it was 
tried again later. They bred men 
specially for it as they bred them 
for all kinds of things. In fact, 
they produced some very strange 
men and women, highly special- 
ized, who were even more zealous 
for order than your people — they 
would not admit chance, which is 
a great stupidity. When their end 
came, it was disastrous. None of 
the specialized types could sur- 
vive. The population dwindled 
down to a few hundred thousand” 
who had enough adaptability to 
start over again.” 

“So you have come to distrust 
order and standards?” 

“We have ceased to think of 
society as a structural engineer- 
ing problem, or of individuals as 
components for assembly into 
some arbitrary pattern.” 

“And you just sit and wait su- 
pinely for the end?” 

“Oh, no! We preserve ourselves 
as material for chance to work 
on. Life was an accident in the 
beginning; .survival has often 



been an accident. Maybe there’ll 
be no more accidents. On the 
other hand, there may.” 

“That sounds very near defeat- 
ism.” 

“In the end, defeat and the 
cold must come. First to the So- 
lar System, then the Galaxy, then 
the Universe, and the rest will be 
silence. Not to admit that is a 
foolish vanity.” She paused. “Yet 
one grows flowers because they 
are lovely, not because one wishes 
them to live for ever.” 

T did not like that world. It was 

as foreign as another planet 
might have been. The strain to 
understand was constant and 
wearisome; it was also unprofit- 
able. Whatever comfort and ease 
I had there were centered in 
Clytassamine. For her I pulled 
down the barriers I had so bitter- 
ly erected around myself in the 
last few years, and I fell the more 
deeply in love on account of 
them. 

Thus there was a second rea- 
son not to let things happen as 
Hymorell had planned. Even 
Clytassamine could not make the 
place heaven, but I had got out 
of hell and I intended to stay out. 

I spent unnumbered hours por- 
ing over the ^transference ma- 
chine, learning all I could of it. 
My progress was slow, but some 
idea of the way it operated did 
begin at last to come to me.

They were tall and strong and

But they were women — he was 
a man. Something had to hap- 
pen — and plenty did ! * 

An explosive story of a 
weird expedition through the

But I could not settle. The 
feeling of transience would not 
leave me, and the days began to 
pass in long, nagging uncertainty. 
There was no way of telling 
whether Hymorell would be suc- 
cessful in getting all the equip- 
ment he needed. I had a haunting, 
mind’s-eye picture of him in my 
wheelchair, working away on the 
contrivance which would con- 
demn me to suffering in that 
broken body again. 

As the weeks went by, the 
strain began to affect me, and I 
grew tense. I was afraid to go to 
sleep lest the next time I woke 
I should find myself back in that 
chair. 

Clytassamine, too, began to 
look worried. Her genuine sym- 
pathy over my distress at the ide%i 
of going back was confused by 
her feeling for Hymorell, who 
must now be suffering what I 
had. There was also the fact that 
my mental strain wasn’t doing 
my temporary body any good, 
either. 

And then, when six unevent- 
ful months had begun to give me 
hope, it happened without sign or 
warning. I went to sleep in the 
room of the great green building: 
I woke back home — with a 
raging pain in my missing leg. 

All was just as it had been. So 
much so that I reached right 
away for the dope bottle. 

When I grew calmer, I found

something which had not been 
there before. It was on the table 
beside me, looking like a radio set 
partially assembled. I certainly 
had not built it. Except for that, 
the whole thing might have been 
a dream. 

I leaned back in my chair, 
considering that mass of wiring 
very carefully. Then I started to 
examine it closely, touching 
nothing. It was, of course, crude 
in construction, compared with the 
transference machine I had stud- 
ied in the place that Clytassamine 
had called Cathalu, but I began 
to see similarities and notice 
adaptations. I was still looking 
at it when I fell asleep. 

By the number of hours I slept, 
I knew Hymorell must have been 
driving my body without letup. 

W HEN I awoke, I began to 
think frantically. My spell 
of soundness and health had left 
me with one firm decision — I 
would not remain an amputee. 

There were two ways out. The 
first, the dope bottle, had always 
been there for the taking and still 
was. But now there was the trans- 
ference instrument. 

I did not understand a - lot 
about it. I doubted whether I 
could successfully retune it if I 
tried, and I did not wish to try. 
For one thing, little though I 
liked that other world, Clytassa- 
mine would be there to help me.

For another, what I had learned 
made me think that I might 
easily land somewhere even less 
desirable. So I left it on Hymor- 
ell’s setting. 

The chief difficulty I foresaw 
was that the machine must re- 
main. He had had to leave it, 
but had never guessed, I suppose, 
that I’d be able to use it. And if I 
were to use it. I’d have to leave it 
there for him to use again. My 
object must be to stop him doing 
that. 

It would be risky to set the 
machine to destroy itself after I 
changed places with him. The 
process is to some extent hypnotic 
and by no means instantaneous. 
Something very queer indeed 
would be likely to happen if it 
were destroyed while the trans- 
mission was in progress. 

Besides, he would be able to 
build another. As long as he ex- 
isted, he would be able to. 

That made the answer fairly 
obvious. 

When I had made my plan, I 
tried the instrument several times, 
but he was awake and wary. I 
saw that I would have to catch 
him asleep, as he had caught me, 
so I went on trying at intervals 
of four hours. 

I don’t know whether he out- 
guessed me or whether he was 
just lucky. I had got hold of the 
poison a year before to keep by 
me in case things became unbear- 



able. My first idea was to swallow 
it in a capsule which would take 
some little time to dissolve. But 
then I realized what would hap- 
pen if something went wrong and 
I could not make the transfer in 
time. That scared away from the 
scheme. Instead, I poured the 
poison into the dope bottle. The 
crystals were white, just like the 
dope itself, only a little larger. 

Once I got a response from the 
instrument, it was easier than I 
had expected. I took hold of the 
two handles and concentrated all 
my attention on the lens. I felt 
giddy. The room swayed and 
blurred. 

When it cleared, I was back 
in that green room, with Cly- 
tassamine beside me. 

I reached my hand toward her, 
and then stopped, for 1 could 
hear her quietly crying. I had 
never known her to do that be- 
fore. 

“What’s the matter?” I asked. 

For a moment she went abso- 
lutely quiet. Then she said, in- 
credulously: “It’s — it’s Terry?’' 

“Well, sure. I told you I wasn’t 
going to be kept back there.” 

She started to cry again, but 
differently. I put my arm around 
her. 

After a while, I asked: ‘,‘What 
is it? What’s all this about?” 

She sniffed. “It’s HymorelL 
Your world has done somethiirg 
dreadful to him. When he came 



152 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



back, he was harsh and bitter. 
He kept talking of pain and 
suffering. I was afraid of him; 
he was — cruel.” 

It did .not greatly surprise me, 
for they knew nothing of illness 
• and physical discomfort. If a 
body became in the least defec- 
tive, th^ transferred. They had 
never had to learn to bear suffer- 
ing. 

“Why didn’t it do that to you, 
too?” she asked. 

“I think it did at first,” I ad- 
mitted. “But you find out after 
a while that that just makes 
things tougher.” 

“I was afraid of him; he was 
cruel,” she repeated. 

¥ kept myself awake for forty- 
eight hours, to make sure. I 
knew that one of the first things 
he would need when he woke was 
the dope, but I had to give him 
time to take it. Then I let myself 
sleep. 

When I opened my eyes, I was 
back in the hospital. It was no 
slow awakening. I knew in a 
flash that he had somehow sus- 
pected the bottle of poison and 
avoided it. The instrument was 
beside me and I saw a thill curl 
of smoke rising from it, as though 
a cigarette had been left burning. 
I began to reach toward it, but 
then caution checked me. I 
caught the leads and pulled them 
out. In among the wiring, I found 



a small can with a glowing fuse 
attached. I flung the can hastily 
through the window. He too, 
Jiowever, had had to allow a safe- 
ty margin : it was half an hour 
before the explosive went off. 

I looked at the dope, I needed 
it badly, but I didn’t dare to 
touch it. I trundled my chair 
over to the cupboard where the 
spare supply was kept. When I 
took out the bottle, though, I 
hesitated. It looked like the real 
stuff and intact — but then, of 
course, it was essential that it 
should. 

Deliberately, I threw it into the 
fireplace, smashing the bottle, 
and wheeled my chair to the tele- 
phone. The doctor was pretty 
nasty to me, but he came, bring- 
ing the stuff with him, thank 
God. 

Various plans occurred to me. 
A poisoned needle, for instance, . 
set strategically in the arm of the 
chair. But the disabled have so 
little privacy. It is difficult 
enough to get the deadlier poisons, 
anyway; when it can be done 
only by finding a third party 
ready to break the law, it be- 
comes virtually impossible. And 
if someone did do it for me, he 
would later appear as an access- 
ory to suicide. The same objec- 
tion applied to laying my hands 
on a few sticks of dynamite. But 
I could buy a time-switch with- 
out any trouble — and I did.

It was, I thought, a neat 
arrangement. My old Army pistol 
wafe trained on the exact position 
my head would occupy when- I 
was at the instrument. Only if 
you were searching for it would 
you notice the muzzle looking 
out from the bookshelves. It was 
fixed to fire when the two handles 
of the instrument were grasped — 
but not until the time-switch was 
on. Thus I could set the switch 
and operate the instrument. Two 
hours later, for safe margin, the 
switch would go over and the 
thing became lethal. If I tried 
and failed to make contact. I had 
only to set the switch again. 

I waited three days, knowing 
that Hymorell would be as wary 
of sleep as I had been, and un- 
certain whether his little grenade 
had been successful. Then I tried 
successfully. 

But three- days later, I was 
back again in my chair. 

T¥YMORELL. damn him, was 
cautious; he must hive spot- 
ted the extra lead to the switch 
right away. It had been snipped 
off. 

But I found his little surprise 
package too — I would have 
melted the instrument, and most 
likely myself along with it, if I 
had touched it before disconnect- 
ing. (The switch was thermosta- 
tic this time, set to cut in as the 
room cooled down — very neat.) 



The pistol and the time-switch 
had vanished, and I set about 
looking for them everywhere 
within range of my chair. I didn’t 
find the pistol, but the switch was 
in the cupboard under the stairs. 
It was arranged to set off a per- 
cussion cap which would ignite 
a gray powder obviously taken 
from the pistol cartridges. There 
were paper and oily rags close by. 

Once I had made sure there 
were no other boobytraps around. 
I settled down to work out an- 
other little reception device of my 
own. I had been caught by a type 
of mine the Germans used which 
didn’t go up until the seventh 
truck had passed over it. The 
idea had its points. 

I spent a couple of days fixing 
that. The transference machine, 
meanwhile, created other prob- 
lems. I changed places with Hy- 
morell, then returned involuntar- 
ily, and got back there again. 

I was getting sick of the game, 
but it seemed to be a duel which 
could only end with one of us 
outsmarting the other. It was a 
stupid battle with too many risks 
for both of us. And neither of us 
dared to sleep. 

“Look here,” I said to Clytass- 
amine. “Suppose I were to trans- 
fer to one of the feebleminded the 
way you people do. Then when 
Hymorell operates again, it will 
be the halfwit who will take my 
place in the chair. We’ll both be 



154

here and the whole thing will be 
solved.” 

She shook her head. “You need 
some sleep, Terry. You’re getting 
fuddled. It’s j'our mind he’s work- 
ing the exchange with. It would- 
n’t make any difference what 
kind of body you were using.” 

She was right, of course — I 
was fuddled. On the third day. 
I just had to sleep. It lasted 
about fourteen of their hours and 
I woke up in the green hall. 

I couldn’t believe he’d let that 
length of time pass without mak- 
ing an attempt, if he were in any 
condition to do so. My little gad- 
get must have gotten rid of him 
this time. 

I began to feel -easier. 

A S the da5?s went on, I grew 
sure of my success. My dread 
of sleep diminished. At last I 
began to feel like a citizen of 
this other world and to look for 
my place in it. With unlimited 
time ahead of me, I didn’t intend 
to spend it hanging around the 
way the rest of them did. 

“Maybe there is only chance 
now,” I said to Clytassamine, 
“but didn’t you ever hear of 
making chances?” 

She smiled, it seemed to me, a 
little wearily. 

“Yes,” she admitted, “I know. 
I felt like that for my first two 
generations. You are so young, 
Terry.” She sat looking at me 



wistfully and a little sadly. 

Why the change should sud- 
denly have come over me then, I 
can’t say. Maybe it wasn’t that 
sudden, but had been working 
up a while; as I looked back at 
her, I found myself seeing her 
quite differently. A cold feeling 
came over me. I saw beyond her 
perfect form and young loveliness. 

Inside, she was old — old and 
wearied — old far beyond my 
reach. She thought of me as a 
child, and had been treating me 
as one. The vigor of my true 
youth had amused her. Perhaps 
it revived her own for a while. 
Now she was tired of it and of 
me. The freshness I had seen was 
nothing but a sham. 

I must have stared at her quite 
a while. “You don’t want me any 
more. You want Hymorell.” 

“Yes, Terry,” she admitted 
quietly. 

For the next day or two 1 
pondered over what to do. I had 
never liked that world. It was 
effete and decaying. What pleas- 
antness there had been had van- 
ished. I felt imprisoned, stifled, 
appalled at the prospect of 
spending several lifetimes in it. 

Now that a return to my 
former torment seemed improb- 
able, the prospect here looked, in 
another way, little better. I began 
to wonder whether mortality, 
wasn’t one of life’s more desirable 
qualities. It’s frightening in most 

■4 



PILLAI TO POST 



1SS 



ways, but more frightening was 
the prospect of an almost eternal 
existence. You can’t believe that 
until you’re faced with it. 

But my worry was unnecess- 
ary; I’m in no danger of immort- 
ality or anything like it. I went to 
sleep despondently in the great 
green building, and when I awoke 
I was in this mental institution 
instead of either the future or the 
hospital. And I wasn’t in either 
Hymorell’s body or my own — 
I was in somebody else'sf 

T here was a male attendant 
nearby, cleaning up around 
the bed. I knew better than to ask 
where and who I was; I had to 
get oriented first, on my own, 
without arousing comment or 
getting into whatever kind of 
trouble Hymorell might have 
cooked up for me. So I just lay 
there, watching the attendant. 

But he turned around and saw 
my eyes on him. He gave a start, 
began approaching the bed, then 
abruptly ducked out. He came 
back a little later with a doctor, 
who lifted my lids and stared at 
the pupils, tried my reflexer and 
finally stood erect, his arms fold- 
ed grimly \yhile he stared at me. 
“What’s your name?” he asked. 
I didn’t answer. 

“Do you know where you are?” 
“In a hospital,” I said. 
“Remember how you got here?” 
As a matter of fact, I wasn’t 



sure at all. Until I was, I had no 
intention of talking. That didn’t 
stop them from putting me 
through a whole series of tests. 
By the time they finished, I rea- 
lized why my silence hadn’t ac- 
complished anything. 

Hymorell had transferred me 
to the body of a feebleminded 
man named Stephen Dallboy. 
When the male attendant had 
turned and seen the light of in- 
telligence in Dallboy’s eyes, it 
•hadn’t mattered whether I spoke 
or not, and the tests had amazed 
the doctors because, not knowing 
the situation, I had given normal 
responses. All except my name. 

I don’t altogether understand 
how Hymorell worked the stunt. 
He must have been as tired as I 
was of the dangerous game we’d 
been playing. The way I see it, he 
probably built another transfer- 
ence machine and used it to lo- 
’cate some accessible body in the 
present. That would be easy — 
just think of the number of pa- 
tients in mental institutions he 
had to choose from ! He happened 
to pick this Stephen Dallboy, a 
congenital imbecile, transferred 
me into that body, and presum- 
ably transferred himself back into 
his own in the future. 

Then what had happened to my 
body? Stephen Dallboy must be 
in it, naturally. Being feeble- 
minded, he wouldn’t even try 
to work the apparatus, and I was

confined to the asylum, unable 
to get to the machine. 

It was a shrewd solution, tak- 
ing me completely away from the 
transfer instrument but it got me 
sore? He could have transferred 
me into a body that wasn’t under 
confinement, couldn’t he? More 
important, though, Dallboy was 
a charity case, whereas I’d in- 
herited money — not much, but 
enough to make a difference — 
and I would* need it if I could 
ever get out of the institution. 

I wrote a letter, signing it 
Stephen Dallboy, and asked 
about Terry Molton, whom I 
claimed as an acquaintance. The 
male attendant mailed it for me; 
I’d counted on him as a possible 
ally and won his friendship by 
playing chess with him. 

The answer came back from 
the hospital, stating that Terry 
Molton was dead. He had appar- 
ently electrocuted himself with 
some experimental radio appara- 
tus. The resulting fuse had start- 
ed a fire in the room, which had 
been discovered and put out be- 
fore it could spread, but not in 
time to save Molton. 

Well, what did that signify? 
The fire had been detected about 
three hours after I had awakened 
to find myself in this asylum. Did 
that mean Hymorell deliberately 
set the boobytrap to destroy the 
equipment and Dallboy along 
with it, so I or anybody else 



wouldn’t be able to pull him 
back into the present ... or was 
it Hymorell who died in my body 
while Dallboy, still imbecilic, was 
in Hymorell’s in the future? 

I decided it didn’t make a 
damned bit of difference. Getting 
even with somebody who won’t 
be born for maybe thousands of 
years makes no sense, especially 
fof some poor guy to whom being 
alive or dead was the same thing. 
And my immediate situation is 
one hell of a lot more urgent. 

If I pretend to be Stephen 
Dallboy, I am an imbecile com- 
mitted to an asylum . and I 
can’t get back my own money. 
If I claim to be Terry Molton, I 
can be proved insane . and I 
still can’t collect my money. I 
don’t know what to do, except 
convince the doctors here that 
I’m normal enough to be released. 

That wouldn’t be so bad, come 
to thing of it, money or no money. 
I at least have all the parts of a 
passable body now. And I ought 
to be able to use this body profit- 
ably in the kind of world I under- 
stand. So I’ve gained a lot more 
than I lost. 

Nevertheless, I am Terry 
Molton. 

I^ALLBOy’S, as you will rea- 
lize, is a well integrated hal- 
lucination; but if there is nothing- 
more serious we shall undoubt- 
edly have to release the patient

in due course, as we see fit. 

However, we do feel that we 
ehould acquaint you with one or 
two discrepant points. One is that, 
although the two men appear 
never to have met, Stephen Dall- 
boy is informed in remarkably in- 
timate detail of Terence Motion's 
affairs. Another is that, when con- 
fronted for test purposes with two 
friends of Motion’s, he immedi- 
ately addressed them by name 
and seemed to know alt about 
them — to their ^reat astonish- 



ment, for they have never to 
their knowledge met him before. 

■ Also, they state he does not in the 
least resemble Terence Motion. 

Nevertheless, you wilt find 
herewith full legal proof that the 
patient is indeed Stephen Dall- 
boy. Should there be any further 
developments, we will keep you 
advised. 

Yours truly,

THE MAGIC OF BELIEVING 

(The Science of Setting Your Goal — and then Reaching It)

This unusual book shows you how to put your inner mind 
to work — how to utilize the power of your subconscious 
mind to help you overcome obstacles and succeed in whatever 
you want to accomplish.

call revelation — gamblers call hunch — top executives call personal magnetism. "The 
Magic of Believing" shows you: 



• How you can win success by working less hard than you do now, 

• How belief makes things happen. 

• How to get what you want easily through a process of making mental pictures. 

• How to use **the law of suggestion” to step up your effectiveness in every- 
thing you do, 

• How to let your imagination find the ways and means of pushing obstacles 
aside for you. 

• How "the mirror technique” will release your subconscious. 

• How to project your thoughts and turn them into achievements. 



You can put this powerful force to work for you at once. In just 10 days you will begin to see 
how this remarkable method can change your entire life/ It will reveal to you what steps to take; 
what decisions to make; who to see; what to say; when and how. "The Magic of Believing" can 
enable YOU to turn ideas into riches, dreams into reality; failure into success.
