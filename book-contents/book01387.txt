"1HE OPENING SEQUENCE IS A 
COMPLETELY UNIQUE AUDIO EXPERIENCE; 
A MIND-EXPANDING TRIP THAT 
TAKES YOU TO AN IW HU' 

—Roger El wood, Editor-in-Chief, Other World Records 



TNfcTtWU #TXW WtitVD itUMM 




The Tower starts where 2002 left off. 

For the first time on record — a shat- 
tering involvement with the OTHER 
WORLD of stereophonic sound. 

Other World Records have cre- 
ated a new experience in sound and 
listening that will envelop you in an 
environment of sound movement and 
full-color audio imagery. 

Based on the short story by Thomas 
N. Scortia, the words and music of The 
Tower take you to another dimension. 

Feel the five-minute opening se- 
quence depicting transition to a gro- 
tesque world via the horrors of the 
nuclear holocaust. 

Live in the new dimension of The 
Tower for timeless moments until the 
mind-exploding climax grips you, 
shakes you, exhausts you and leaves 
you limp and aWed at your contact 
with a different reality! 

Utilizing music, electronics and spe- 
cial vocal effects, and combining them 
under the supervision of the brightest 
talents in these fields, The Tower cre- 



ates an intricate fantasy, painting color 
pictures on the canvas of your mind. 

Roger Elwood (the noted Science 
Fiction Iconoclast) also says of The 
Tower, “I was truly overwhelmed at 
the scope and intensity of the sound 
movement and quality... an experience 
I’ll repeat many times in the future.” 
The Tower is the first in a series of 
audio environments planned by Other 
World Records, available by mail

S tark got his final view of Pax 
from the tender going out to the 
spaceport moon. It was the best 
view he had ever had of Pax, which 
is the chief habitable planet of 
Vega. Pax is also a city. Its proud 
boast is that not a single grain of 
corn grows upon it nor is one single 
useful item manufactured. 

The city soars up into the sky. It 
spreads out over every * landmass 
and swallows up small seas. It 
burrows underground, level below 
level. Large areas are conditioned 
and equipped for non-humans. 
Everything necessary for life is im- 
ported from off-planet. All supplies 
first reach the lunar dock, then are 
brought down by freight tenders. 



5 



Nothing lives on Pax but bureau- 
crats, diplomats and computers. 
For Pax is the administrative center 
of the Galactic Union, a federation 
of worlds flung across half the 
Milky Way and including, very 
incidentally, the worlds of little Sol. 
On Pax the millions of problems 
besetting the billions of people in- 
habiting thousands of diverse plan- 
ets are reduced to tidy and presum- 
ably manageable abstractions on 
tapes, cards and endless sheets of 
paper. 

A paper world. Stark thought, 
full of paper people. 

Stark had to admit, though, that 
Simon Ashton was not made of 
paper. Time, and accomplishments 
in planetary administration, had 
promoted Ashton to a comfortable 
office at the Ministry of Planetary 
Affairs and a comfortable apart- 
ment in a mile-high building he 
need never have left except to take 
one of the moving walkways to his 
work. Still, Ashton had never lost 
his rawhide, taut-wire energy. He 
went often into the field, knowing 
that the problems of real beings in 
actual places could not be properly 
solved merely by the regurgitation 
of data from a bank of clacking 
machines. 

But Ashton had gone once too 
often into the field. The last time he 
had not come back. 

Stark had received that informa- 
tion on one of the untamed worlds 
outside the Union where life was a 
little more relaxed for people like 



himself. He was, as the old phrase 
had it, a wolfs head — a totally 
masterless man. In a society where 
everyone respectable belonged to 
something, he owed allegiance only 
where he chose to, usually for pay. 
He was a mercenary by trade, and 
there were enough little wars going 
on both in and out of the Union, 
enough remote peoples calling oh 
him for the use of his talents, to 
guarantee him a reasonable living 
doing what he did best. 

Fighting. 

Stark had begun fighting almost 
before he could stand. Born in a 
mining colony in Mercury’s Twi- 
light Belt, he had fought to live on a 
planet that did not encourage life. 
His parents dead, his foster-parents 
a tribe of sub-human aboriginals 
clawing a precarious existence from 
the sun-stricken valleys, he had 
been forced to fight. He had 
fought, without success, the men 
who had slaughtered those foster- 
parents and had put him in a cage, 
a snarling curiosity. Later he had 
fought for a different kind of sur- 
vival — the survival in himself of 
human feeling, human soul. 

But he would never have got past 
Square One without Simon Ashton. 

Stark could remember vividly the 
heat, the raw pain of loss, the bars, 
the men who had laughed and tor- 
mented him. Then Ashton had 
come. Ashton the wield er of autho- 
rity, the savior. That had been the 
beginning of the life of Eric John 
Stark, as distinguished from

IF 




N’Chaka, the Man-Without-a- 
Tribe. 

Twice orphaned, Stark/N’Chaka 
had gradually accepted Ashton as 
his father-in-being. More than 
that, he had accepted Ashton as his 
friend. During his growth to man- 
hood Ashton had been nearly his 
sole companion because they had 
been much alone in the frontier sta- 
tions to which Ashton was assigned. 
Ashton’s kindness, his counsel, his 
patience, his strength and his affec- 
tion, were stamped indelibly on 
Stark. He had even found his name 
through Ashton, who had searched 
the records of Mercury Metals and 
Mining to track down his parents. 

And now Simon Ashton was mis- 
sing. Lost on the world circling a 
ginger star somewhere at the back 
of beyond, out in the Orion Spur. A 
newly discovered, newly opened 
world called Skaith that hardly 
anyone had ever heard of, except at 
Galactic Center. 

Skaith was not a member of the 
Union but did have a consulate. 
Someone there had called to the 
Union for help. Ashton had re- 
sponded, taking the first ship out. 

Ashton, after reaching the place, 
had perhaps exceeded his author- 
ity. Even so, his superiors had done 
their best for him. But the local 
powers had closed the consulate 
and refused entrance to officers of 
the Union. All attempts to discover 
Ashton’s whereabouts or the reason 
for his disappearance had failed. 

Stark had caught the first avail- 



able ship outbound for Galactic 
Center and Pax. Looking for 
Ashton he considered his personal 
business. 

The weeks he had spent at Pax 
had been neither pleasant nor easy. 
He had had to do a great deal of 
talking and convincing, and after 
that, much learning. He was glad 
to be leaving, impatient to get on 
with the job. 

As the world-city dropped behind 
him, he breathed more freely. 
Presently the enormous intricacies 
of the lunar spaceport engulfed 
him, sorted him, tagged him, even- 
tually spewed him into the bowels 
of a cargo liner that took him about 
a third of the way to his destina- 
tion. There were three transfers 
after that, each into a still more 
doubtful vessel, the last a rickety 
old tramp — the only sort of ship 
that served Skaith. 

Stark endured the voyage, con- 
tinuing by means of tapes the edu- 
cation into things Skaithian he had 
begun at Pax. He was not popular 
among his fellow-travelers. His 
cabinmate complained that Stark 
twitched and growled in his sleep 
like an animal, and there was 
something in the gaze of Stark’s 
pale eyes that disconcerted the 
others. They called him “the wild 
man” behind his back, stopped try- 
ing to lure him into games, the dis- 
cussion of schemes for turning a 
quick profit, or personal reminis- 
cences. 

The tramp trader made several

planetfalls along the way but even- 
tually creaked and rattled out of 
FTL drive within sight of Skaith. 

It was the fourth month, by 
Galactic Arbitrary Time, after Ash- 
ton’s disappearance. 

Stark destroyed his tapes and 
collected his few belongings. The 
rickety trader settled down on the 
rickety starport outside the city of 
Skeg. 

Stark was the first man off the 
ship. 



tjis papers gave his right name, 
jJ which meant nothing here, but 
they did not mention Pax as point 
of origin. They said that he was an 
Earthman, which he was in a way, 
and a dealer in rarities, which he 
was not. 

At the barrier shed a couple of 
surly customs-men confiscated his 
purely defensive stunner — he could 
have it back, they said, when he 
left. They searched him and his 
meager luggage for other weapons. 
He was then given a terse lecture, in 
bad Universal, on the rules and 
regulations governing life in Skeg. 
Finally he was sent on his way with 
the parting information that all 
roads out of Skeg except that one to 
the starport were closed to off- 
worlders. He was not under any cir- 
cumstances to leave the city. 

He rode the ten miles in a jolting 
cart past plantations of tropical 
fruits, waterlogged paddies where 
some form of grain was growing 



lushly, and patches of jungle. 
Gradually the smell of mud and 
vegetation became overlaid by a 
smell of sea-water — warm, salt and 
stagnant. Stark did not much like 
it. 

When the cart topped a line of 
jungled hills, Stark found he did 
not much like the look of the sea, 
either. Skaith had no moon so there 
were no tides to stir it. There was a 
milky, greasy sheen to the surface. 
Skaith’s senile ginger-colored sun 
was going down in a fury of crimson 
and molten brass, laying streaks of 
unhealthy brilliance across the 
water. It seemed a perfect habitat 
for the peculiar creatures said to 
live in it. 

Beside the sea, on the bank of a 
river, lay Skeg. The river had 
grown thin with age, too weak to do 
more than trickle through a narrow 
passage where the silt of centuries 
had formed a bar almost closing its 
mouth. There was a ruined fortress- 
tower set on low cliffs to guard a 
vanished harbor. But the city itself 
looked lively enough, with lamps 
and torches glowing brighter as the 
sun sank. 

Presently Stark saw the first of 
the Three Ladies: magnificent star- 
clusters, the ornament of Skaith’s 
night skies, that made it almost im- 
possible to come by a decent dark- 
ness. He glowered at the lady, ad- 
miring her beauty but thinking that 
she and her sisters could make 
things difficult for him. 

As though things would not be

IF 




difficult enough in any case . 

At last the cart clumped into 
town. Skeg was essentially one 
great open market where practical- 
ly anything could be bought or 
sold. Shops and stalls were brightly 
lighted. Vendors with barrows 
cried their wares. People from all 
over the Fertile Belt — tall leather- 
clad warrior-burghers from the out- 
lying city-states, as well as the small 
silken folk of the tropics — mingled 
with the off-worlders who had come 
to traffic, exchanging precious 
foreign items like iron pigs for 
drugs, or for artifacts looted from 
Skaith’s plentiful supply of ruins. 

And of course there were the 
Farers. Everywhere. A conglomer- 
ate of all the races, dressed or un- 
dressed in every imaginable fash- 
ion, trooping about, lying about, 
doing whatever happened to occur 
to them from moment to moment. 
These careless itinerant children of 
the Lords Protector neither toiled 
nor spun but blew lightly with the 
winds of the world. Stark noticed 
some off-worlders among them, 
drifters who had found the good life 
here in the warm twilight of a 
planet where nothing was forbid- 
den and where, if you belonged to 
the right group, everything was 
free. 

Stark paid off his driver and 
found lodgings at an inn catering to 
off-worlders. The room was small 
but reasonably clean, and the food, 
when he sampled it, not at all bad. 

Still, he was not interested in 



comfort. He was interested in 
Ashton. 

When he had fed, he approached 
the landlord in the common-room 
of the inn. It was built in the breezy 
tropical style of Skeg, being mostly 
windows with reed curtains that 
rolled down to shut out the rain. It 
was not raining now and the sea- 
wind blew through, heavy and 
damp. 

“How do I find the Galactic 
Union consulate?” 

The landlord stared. He was 
reddish of color, with a face of 
stone and startlingly light, very cold 
gray eyes. 

‘‘Consulate? Didn’t you know?” 

“Know what?’’ asked Stark, 
looking suitably blank. 

“There isn’t one. Not any more.” 

“But I was told . 

“The Farers wrecked it, not 
quite four months ago. Sent the 
consul and his staff packing. 
They . 

“The Farers?” 

“Surely you were told about 
them at the starport. All that 
human garbage littering up the 
streets.” 

“Oh, yes,” said Stark. “I was 
just surprised that they should con- 
cern themselves with a consulate. 
They seem — well, so indolent.” 

“All they need is the word,” said 
the landlord sourly. “When the 
Wandsmen say go, they go.” 

Stark nodded. “I was warned 
about the Wandsmen, too. Pain of 
death and all that. They seem im-

portant men on Skaith.” 

“They do the dirty work for the 
Lords Protector. The Chief Wands- 
man of Skeg, the almighty Gelmar, 
led the Farers. He told the consul to 
get gone and stay gone, they 
wanted no more outside interfer- 
ence. In fact, it looked for a while 
as though they might kick out all us 
off-worlders and close the starport. 
They didn’t, quite. Need imports 
too badly. But they treated us like 
criminals.” 

Stark nodded sympathetically. 
“What was the row about?” 

“Some damned official busybody 
from Pax. It’s a fairly open secret 
that he was here to arrange emigra- 
tion from one of the city-states. 
More fool he.” 

‘‘Trouble-maker, hey? What 
happened to him?” 

“Who knows? Except the Wands- 
men.” The cold eyes regarded 
Stark suspiciously. “Got a particu- 
lar interest?” 

“Hardly.” 

“Then drop the subject. We’ve 
had trouble enough already. What 
did you want with the consulate, 
anyway?” 

‘‘Some routine business about 
travel papers. It will have to wait 
till my next port of call, I guess.” 

Stark bade the landlord good 
night and walked out. 

Some damned busybody from 
Pax. 

Ashton. 

And only the Wandsmen knew 
what had happened to him. 



S tark walked through the 
crowded streets, a dark man in 
a dark tunic, a big man powerfully 
muscled, who carried himself as 
lightly and easily as a dancer. He 
was in no hurry. He let the city flow 
around him, absorbing it through 
all his senses. He was aware of the 
lights, the colors, the mingled 
smells, the strange musics made by 
unnameable instruments and alien 
voices, the bright banners that 
hung above the sin-shops, the 
movements of people. And under- 
neath it all he sensed a rich, ripe 
stink of decay. Skaith was dying, of 
course, but it did not seem to him 
to be dying well. 

He could see no reason to delay 
sticking his head into the noose. So 
presently he entered a tavern and 
began his work. 

He went about it most discreetly. 
He had spent what had seemed an 
eternity at Pax, going With bitter 
patience through all the existing in- 
formation about Skaith, learning 
the language, learning as much as 
was known about the people and 
the customs, talking to the ex-con- 
sul in an effort to learn more. It was 
of course too late to save Ashton if 
the Wandsmen had decided he 
should die. But vengeance — ven- 
geance was always possible. Rescue 
or revenge — for either, Stark need- 
ed all the knowledge he could get. 

But the facts available at Pax 
had proved not really extensive. 
Contact with Skaith had first been 
made only a dozen or so years 



10 



IF 




before. The consulate had not been 
established until five years later. 
Considerable was known about 
Skeg and the adjacent country. A 
little was known about the city- 
states. Almost nothing was known 
about the lands beyond the Fertile 
Belt where most of the population 
of Skaith was now gathered. There 
were plenty of tall tales about the 
Barrens and the People of the 
Barrens. Perhaps some were true, 
perhaps not. 

Nor was much known about the 
Lords Protector. No one knew 
exactly what they looked like or 
where they dwelled except the 
Wandsmen, who kept that knowl- 
edge a high and holy secret. The be- 
liefs of various sects and cults only 
confused matters. Stark remember- 
ed well the consul’s report. In part 
it had said: 

The Lords Protector, re- 
puted to be “undying and un- 
changing,” were apparently 
established long ago by the 
then ruling powers, as a sort 
of super-benevolence. The 
Great Migrations were begin- 
ning, the civilizations of the 
north were breaking up as the 
people moved away from the 
increasing cold, and there 
was certain to be a time of 
chaos with various groups 
competing for new lands. 
Then and later, when some 
stability was reestablished, 
the Lords Protector were to 



prevent total trampling of the 
weak by the strong. Their law 
was simple: succor the weak, 
feed the hungry, shelter the 
homeless, strive always for 
the greatest good of the great- 
est number. 

It appears that through the 
centuries that law was carried 
far beyond its original intent. 
The Farers and the many 
smaller nonproductive frag- 
ments of this thoroughly frag- 
mented culture are now the 
greater number, with the re- 
sult that the Wandsmen, in 
the name of the Lords Protec- 
tor, hold a third or more of 
the population in virtual slav- 
ery to supply the rest. 

It is quite obvious to me 
that upon learning of the in- 
tention of the Irnanese to 
emigrate , the W andsmen took 
immediate and violent action. 
If Irnan were to succeed, 
other communities would fol- 
low — leaving the Wandsmen 
and their charges in sad state. 
The Irnans’ call for help was 
relayed by this consulate. So 
Ashton’s disappearance and 
the forcible closing of the 
consulate came as a shock to 
us but hardly as a surprise. 

What Stark wanted to do was 
seek out Gelmar and tear him 
slowly and painfully into small bits 
until he told what he had done to 
Ashton. This was not possible be-

cause of the Farers — the devoted, 
perpetual, ever-ready, instant mob. 
So Stark set himself out as bait. 

For two days he walked quietly in 
the streets, sat quietly in the 
taverns, talked quietly to anyone 
who would listen. He asked lots of 
questions, occasionally letting slip 
the name Iman. 

On the evening of the second day 
the bait was taken. 

II 

H e was in the principal street of 
Skeg, in the main market 
square, watching a troupe of acro- 
bats. They were performing indif- 
ferent stunts with a minimum of 
skill when someone came and stood 
close to him, very close, warm and 
. breathing. 

He looked down. A girl — a 
Farer, stark naked except for body- 
paint laid on in fanciful loops and 
spirals. Her hair hung over her 
shoulders like a cloak. She looked 
up at Stark and smilfed. 

“My name is Baya,” she said. It 
meant Graceful, and that she was. 
“Come with me, stranger.” 

“Sorry. I’m not ill the market.” 
She continued to smile. “Love 
can come later, if you wish. Or not, 
if you wish. But I can tell you some- 
thing about the man Ashton. He 
who took the road to Irnan.” 

He said sharply, “What do you 
know about that?” 

“I am a Farer. We know many 
things.” 



“Very well, then. Tell me about 
Ashton.” 

“Not here. Too many eyes and 
ears, and the subject is forbidden.” 

“Then why are you willing to 
talk?” 

Her eyes and her warm mouth 
told him why she was willing. But 
she said, “I don’t care for rules, 
any rules. You know the old for- 
tress on the cliffs? Go there now. 
I’ll follow.” 

Stark hesitated, frowning and 
suspicious. 

She shrugged. “It’s up to you.” 

She drifted off into the crowd. 
Stark considered. She was bait for 
a trap, probably. But he reminded 
himself that so was he — or trying to 
be. He began to walk casually along 
the street toward the lower end. 
There it narrowed into a quiet lane 
that extended to the river. 

A bridge had stood here once. 
Now there was only a ford paved 
with stones. A man dressed in a 
yellow robe picked his way across 
it, his skirts tucked up and his wet 
thighs flashing. Half a dozen men 
and women followed him in a body, 
holding each other’s hands. Stark 
turned onto the broken pavement 
of the embankment. 

The fortress loomed ahead, the 
sea lapping the cliffs below it. The 
ginger star was setting in its usual 
lurid manner. The tideless water 
gleamed, gradually taking on a 
sheen of pearl overlaying brass. 
Things swirled and splashed in it, 
and there was a strange far-off

IF 




sound of hooting voices that made 
Stark shiver. The consul had duti- 
fully written down what had been 
told to him about the Children of 
the Sea-Our-Mother but obviously 
had not believed it. Stark kept an 
open mind. 

In a few moments he reached the 
fortress. Its ancient walls towered 
above him, still with the stillness of 
idle centuries, the gaping doors and 
window-niches dark and empty. He 
leaned against a column and 
waited, tasting the dankness of the 
air. 

The girl came, padding on bare 
feet. And there was someone with 
her, a tall man who wore a rich 
tunic of somber red and carried a 
wand of office. A man of proud 
calm face, a man of power who had 
never known fear. 

“I am Gelmar,” he said, “Chief 
Wandsman of Skeg.” 

Stark nodded. 

“Your name is Eric John Stark,” 
said Gelmar. “You are an Earth- 
man, like Ashton.” 

“Yes.” 

“What are you to Ashton?” 

“Friend. Foster-son. I owe him 
my life.” Stark clenched his fists. 
“I want to know what happened to 
him.” 

“And perhaps I’ll tell you,” said 
Gelmar easily. “But first you must 
tell me who sent you.” 

“No one. When I heard that 
Ashton was missing, I came.” 

“You speak our language. You 
know about Irnan. You must have 



been at Galactic Center, to learn 
these things.” 

“I went there to learn.” 

“And then you came to Skaith 
because of your love for Ashton?” 
“Yes.” 

“I don’t think I believe you, 
Earthman. I think you were sent to 
make more mischief here.” 

In the reddening dusk, Stark saw 
that they were looking at him 
oddly. When Gelmar spoke again 
his tone had changed subtly, as 
though he were now posing ques- 
tions of greater urgency. 

“Who is your master? Ashton? 
The Ministry?” 

Stark said, “I have no master.” 
His ears were stretched. It seemed 
to him that he had heard small 
sounds. 

“A wolfs-head,” said Gelmar 
softly. “Where is your home?” 
“Nowhere.” 

“A landless man.” This was 
beginning to have a ritual sound. 
“Who are your people?” 

“I have none. I was not born on 
Earth. I have another name— 
N’Chaka, Man-Without-a-Tribe.” 
Baya exhaled sharply. “Let me 
ask him,” she said. Her eyes were 
bright, catching the afterglow. “A 
wolfs-head, a landless man, a man 
without a tribe.” She touched Stark 
with a small hand, and the fingers 
were cold as ice. “Will you join with 
me and be a Farer? Then you will 
have one master — love. And one 
home — Skaith. And one people. 
Us.”

Stark said, “No. It is not my 
nature to join.” 

She drew back from him sharply, 
her eyes still brighter as if with 
some light of their own. 

She said to Gelmar, “It is he. It 
is the Dark Man of the prophecy.” 

Astonished, Stark blurted, 
“What prophecy?” 

“That is something they could 
not tell you at Pax,” said Gelmar. 
“The prophecy was not made until 
after we banished the consul. But 
we have been waiting for you.” 

The girl gave a sudden cry — a 
signal? — and then Stark heard the 
small sounds become large ones. 
He whirled to face the onslaught he 
had been expecting. 

They came around the fortress, 
perhaps twenty of them, male and 
female, leaping grotesques of all 
shapes and sizes. Careless garments 
flapped. Hands brandished sticks 
and stones. Some were chanting, 
“Kill, kill!” 

Stark said, “I thought it was for- 
bidden to kill.” 

Gelmar smiled. “Not when I 
order it.” 

Baya drew a long pin like a sti- 
letto from the darkness of her hair. 

Stark looked this way and that to 
find a way of escape. Gelmar 
moved toward the seaward edge of 
the cliff, giving his Farers free room 
as the stones began to fly. 

Out over the water, the hooting 
voices called and chuckled. 

Stark sprang like a wild beast 
and bore Gelmar into the sea. 



T hey sank to a slimy bottom. It 
had been instantly apparent 
that Gelmar could not swim. Stark 
held him down relentlessly until his 
struggles weakened. Then he 
brought him to the surface and let 
him breathe. The gasping Gelmar 
stared at him in such pop-eyed 
amazement that Stark laughed. 
Up on the cliff the stunned Farers 
stood in a ragged line. 

“The Children of the Sea-Our- 
Mother,” Stark said. “I am told 
they eat men.” 

“They do,’’ rasped Gelmar, 
strangling. “You must be insane!” 
The Wandsman goggled at him. 
“What have I to lose?’’ said 
Stark, and pushed him under. 
When he let Gelmar up again the 
last of the Chief Wandsman’ s arro- 
gance was gone, lost in a paroxysm 
of retching. 

The hooting voices had come 
closer. - There was a new note in 
them of alert interest, as when 
hounds pick up a scent. 

“Two questions,” said Stark. “Is 
Ashton alive?” Gelmar choked and 
gagged, and Stark shook him. “Do 
you want the Children to share 
you? Answer me!” 

Feebly Gelmar answered. “Yes. 
Yes. He’s alive.” 

“Do you lie, Wandsman? Shall I 
drown you?” 

“No! The Lords Protector wanted 
him alive. To question. We captur- 
ed him on the road to Irnan.” 
“Where is he?” 

“North: Citadel of the Lords Pro- 



14 



IF 




tector ... at Worldheart.” 

The Farers had begun wailing, a 
collection of banshees. They were 
forming a chain down the cliff, 
reaching out their hands to succor 
Gelmar. The first of the Three 
Ladies silvered sky and sea. There 
was a great and savage joy in 
Stark’s belly. 

“One more question. What pro- 
phecy?” 

“Gerrith . wise woman of Ir- 
nan.” Gelmar was finding his 
tongue as the seaward hoots came 
nearer. “She prophesied that an 
off-worlder would come, would 
destroy the Lords because of Ash- 
ton.” Gelmar’s eyes yearned to- 
ward the steep shore. 

“Ah,” said Stark. “Did she now? 
Maybe she was right.” 

He thrust Gelmar from him, to- 
ward the reaching hands, and did 
not wait to see whether or not he 
made it. Across the warm and 
somehow unclean water Stark 
glimpsed flashes of white in the 
cluster-light like many swimmers 
tossing spray. 

Stark kicked off his sandals, put 
his head down. He sprinted for the 
bar at the river mouth. 

The rush of his passage blotted 
out other noises. Yet he knew the 
things were gaining on him. He 
managed to lengthen his stroke just 
a fraction more. Then he began to 
feel the vibrations, a sort of boom- 
ing in the water as something dis- 
placed it with rhythmic blows. He 
was aware of a body, immensely 



strong, impossibly swift, pulling 
ahead of him. 

Instead of turning and fleeing 
blindly, as he was expected to, 
Stark swerved to the attack. 

Ill 

O uickly Stark realized he had 
' made a mistake. Possibly his 
last one. 

He had the advantage of surprise 
but that was short-lived. In the 
matter of strength and reflexes he 
was as near the animal as a man 
can reasonably be. But the creature 
he fought with was nearer, a lot 
nearer, and was in its own element. 
Stark grappled with it and it shot 
upward from the water like a tar- 
pon, breaking his grip. He saw it 
briefly above him in the cluster- 
light, outstretched arms shaking 
diamond drops, body girdled with 
foam. It looked down at him, 
laughing, and its eyes were like 
pearls. Then it was gone in a 
curving arc that carried it beneath 
the surface. Its form was manlike, 
except that there seemed webs of 
skin in odd places and the head was 
earless. 

And it was somewhere beneath 
him now, out of sight. 

Stark rolled and dived. 

The thing circled him round, 
flashed over him, and again was 
gone. It was having fun. 

Stark came back to the surface. 
Farther out, the splashing had 
ceased. He could see heads bobbing

about and hear those hateful voices 
hooting and ha-ha-ing. For the mo- 
ment the pack seemed to be 
standing off, allowing their leader 
to play out his game. 

There was nothing Stark could 
see between himself and the silty 
bar. He set off toward it again, 
swimming madly. 

For a while nothing happened. 
Now the bar was so tantalizingly 
close that he almost thought he 
might make it. Then a powerful 
hand closed on his ankle and drew 
him smoothly under. 

Recklessly expending strength 
because there was nothing to save it 
for, he bent his knees, doubling his 
body against the thrust of the water 
that wanted to keep it stretched. He 
grasped his own ankle, found the 
odd hand that did not belong there, 
and shifted his grip to the alien 
wrist. And all the time he and the 
sea-thing were plunging deeper and 
the milky light was growing dim- 
mer. 

The arm was long and furred. 
Stark felt the powerful muscles im- 
bedded in a layer of fat. His grip 
kept slipping, and he knew that if 
he lost it he was finished. He had 
been overbreathing while he swam, 
storing up oxygen, but he was using 
it at a great rate and his heart was 
already hammering. His fingers 
clawed and tore, moving convul- 
sively toward the point of leverage. 

The smooth descent stopped. 
The creature turned its head and 
Stark saw the blurred face, eyes 



filmed and staring, bubbles trickl- 
ing from a vestigial nose. The free 
arm that had been oaring them 
downward now swung over, not 
toward his hands but toward the 
back of his neck. The game was 
over. 

Stark sunk his head between his 
shoulders. Talons ripped at the wet 
ridges of muscles. His own hand 
found a grip in a web of skin 
backing the creature’s armpit. He 
straightened his body with a violent 
thrust and his ankle came free. He 
pulled himself under the creature’s 
arm. 

This Child of the Sea had also 
made a mistake. It had underesti- 
mated its victim. The humans who 
came its way — capsized fishermen 
or ritual offerings provided by the 
landbound worshippers of the Sea- 
Our-Mother, were easy prey. They 
knew that they were doomed. Stark 
was not so sure, and he had the 
thought of Ashton and the pro- 
phecy to bolster him. He managed 
to clamp his arms around the 
sinewy neck from behind, to lock 
his legs around the incredibly 
powerful body. 

Then he hung on. 

The creature rolled and sounded, 
fighting to shake him off. It was 
like riding an angry whale, and 
Stark was dying, dying, tightening 
his hold in a blind red rage, deter- 
mined not to die first. 

When the sodden cracking of the 
neckbones came at last, he could 
hardly believe it. 



16 



IF 




He let go. The body fell away 
from him, dribbling dark bubbles 
from nose and mouth where the 
trapped breath vented. Stark went 
like an arrow for the surface. 

Instinct made him break quietly. 
He hung there, savoring the deli- 
ciousness of new air in his lungs, 
trying not to sob audibly as he 
gulped it in. He could not at first 
remember why this was imperative. 
Then, as the ringing darkness in his 
mind began to clear, he could hear 
again the laughing, hooting voices 
of the pack, waiting for their leader 
to bring them meat. And he knew 
that he dared not rest. 

The battle had carried him 
beyond the bar, beyond the narrow 
boat-channel. Which was as well 
because he could not in any case go 
back to Skeg. The group on the 
cliff, like the Children, were still 
waiting. He could see them only as 
a dark blob in the distance, and he 
was sure they could not see him at 
all. With any luck they might think 
he had perished in the sea. 

With any luck. Stark smiled 
cynically. It was not that he did not 
believe in luck. It was only that he 
had found it to be an uncertain 
ally. 

With infinite caution, he swam 
the short distance to the far bank of 
the river and crawled out on dry 
land. There were ruins here, a 
tangle of old walls long abandoned 
and overgrown with vines. They 
made excellent cover. Stark went in 
among them and sat down, leaning 



his back against warm stone. Every 
joint and muscle was a separate an- 
guish; bruised, strained and clam- 
oring. 

A voice said, “Did you kill the 
thing?” 

Stark looked up. A man stood in 
a gap in the wall on the landward 
side. It was almost as though he 
had been waiting for Stark’s ar- 
rival. He wore a robe, and though 
the cluster-light altered colors Stark 
was sure the robe was yellow. 

“You’re the man I saw at the 
ford.” 

“Yes. Gelmar and the girl came 
after you, and then a gang of 
Farers. The Farers threw stones at 
us and told us to go away. So we 
crossed back. I left my people and 
came down here to see what was 
happening.” He repeated, ‘‘Did 
you kill the thing?” 

“I did.” 

“Then you’d better come away. 
They’re not entirely seabound, you 
know. They’ll be swarming here in 
a few minutes, hunting you.” He 
added, “By the way, my name is 
Yarrod.” 

“Eric John Stark.” He rose, sud- 
denly aware that seaward the voices 
of the Children had fallen silent. 
Too much time had passed. They 
would know by now that something 
had gone wrong. 



Y r ARROD set off through the 
ruins. Stark followed until they 
had gone what he thought a safe

distance from the bar. Then he set 
his hand on Yarrod’s shoulder and 
halted him. 

“What have you to do with me, 
Yarrod?” 

“I don’t know yet.” He studied 
Stark in the cluster-light. Yarrod 
was a tall man, wide in the shoul- 
der, bony and muscular. Stark 
guessed that he was a warrior by 
trade, masquerading for some rea- 
son as something else. “Perhaps 
I’m curious to know why Gelmar 
would want to kill an off-worlder in 
a place where killing is forbidden 
even to the Farers.” 

From the sea there came a wild 
howling of grief and rage that set 
Stark’s hackles bristling. 

“Hear that?’’ said Yarrod. 
“They’ve found the body. Now 
Gelmar will know you killed the 
thing, and he’ll assume that you 
could be alive. He’s bound to try 
and find you. Would you like to be 
hunted through these ruins by the 
Farers — or will you trust me to give 
you safe hiding?” 

“I seem not to have much 
choice,” said Stark, and shrugged. 
But he went warily behind Yarrod. 

The tone of the howling changed 
as some of the creatures, judging by 
the distant sounds, began to clam- 
ber onto the bar. 

“What are they? Beast or hu- 
man?” 

“Both. A thousand years ago or 
so, some people got the idea that 
the only salvation was for man to 
return to the Sea-Our-Mother from 



whose womb we came. And they 
did. Had their genes altered by 
some method still known then, to 
speed up the adaptation. And there 
they are, losing more of their hum- 
anness with every generation. But 
happier than we are.” 

He increased his pace and Stark 
matched it, the savage howling 
growing fainter in his ears. The 
consul might doubt the story told 
about the Children of the Sea. 
Stark did not. Not any more. 

As though reading his thoughts, 
Yarrod chuckled. “Skaith is full of 
surprises. You’ve another just 
ahead.” 

High on the bank above the ford 
of the river rose part of a barrel 
arch. Although intact overhead it 
was open at both ends — which in 
that gentle climate scarcely matter- 
ed. Drooping vines acted as cur- 
tains. A fire burned inside, and the 
half-dozen men and women Stark 
had seen before with Yarrod sat by 
it in a close group, heads together, 
arms intertwined. They neither 
moved nor looked up as Stark and 
Yarrod entered. 

“Pretty good, aren’t they?” said 
Yarrod. “Or do you know?” 

Stark clawed back through his 
mental file on Skaith. “They’re 
pretending to be a pod. And you’re 
supposed to be a pod-master.” 

A pod, according to the file, was 
a collection of people so thoroughly 
sensitized by a species of group 
therapy that they no longer existed 
as individuals but only as interde- 



18 



IF 




pendent parts of a single organism. 
The pod-master trained them, then 
kept them fed and washed and 
combed until such time as the hour 
arrived for Total Fulfillment. That 
was when one of the components 
died and the whole organism went, 
finding escape at last. The average 
life of a pod was four years. Then 
the pod-master started over again 
with another group. 

“Pod-masters can go anywhere,” 
said Yarrod. “They’re nearly as 
holy as Wandsmen.” He turned to 
the group. “All right, friends, you 
may breathe again, but not for 
long. Gelmar and his rabble will be 
coming soon, looking for our guest. 
Breca, go keep watch on the ford, 
will you?” 

The group broke up. A tall 
woman, evidently Breca, gave Stark 
a strangely penetrating look, then 
vanished without a sound through 
the vines. Stark studied the faces of 
the remaining five in the firelight. 
They were strong faces, alert and 
wary, intensely curious, as though 
he might mean something to them. 

One of the five, a big man with a 
contentious air and a jealous eye, 
whom Stark disliked on sight, 
asked Yarrod, “What was all that 
howling from the bar?” 

Yarrod nodded at Stark. “He 
killed a Child of the Sea.” 

“And lived? I don’t believe it!” 
“I saw it,” said Yarrod curtly. 
“Now tell us, Stark. Why did Gel- 
mar set the Farers on you?” 
“Partly because I had been ask- 



ing about Ashton. And partly be- 
cause of a prophecy.” 

They all expelled breath sharply, 
as the Farer girl had. 

“What prophecy?” 

“Someone called the wise woman 
of Irnan predicted that an off- 
worlder would destroy the Lords 
Protector because of Ashton.” He 
added evenly, “But you know all 
about that, don’t you?” 

“We’re all from Irnan,” said 
Yarrod. “We waited there for 
Ashton but he never arrived. Then 
the wise one, Gerrith, made her 
prophecy and the Wandsmen killed 
her. What was Ashton to you?” 
“What is a father to a son, a 
brother to a brother?” Stark 
moved, easing the aches of his 
body. But there was no ease for the 
deeper pain, and they saw that in 
his expression and were disturbed. 

“You people of Irnan decided to 
leave this planet, which I can 
readily understand. Through the 
GU consul at Skeg and keeping the 
matter very confidential, you then 
applied for help. The Ministry of 
Planetary Affairs agreed to find you 
a suitable place on another world, 
and to supply the ships for your 
emigration. Ashton reached Skaith 
from the Ministry to make the final 
arrangements. As someone said, 
the more fool he — because your 
plans had stopped being confiden- 
tial. Who talked?” 

“None of us,” said Yarrod. 
“Probably someone at the consu- 
late. Perhaps Ashton was careless.” 



THE GINGER STAR

“Gelmar captured him. On the 
Irnan road.” 

“Did Gelmar tell you that?” 

“He tried to have me killed. So I 
took him with me into the sea, and 
gave him a choice-^drown or talk.” 

Yarrod groaned. “You took him 
into the sea. Don’t you know that it 
is forbidden, absolutely forbidden 
on pain of death, to lay heads upon 
or interfere with a Wandsman in 
any way?” 

“I was already under pain of 
death, and it seemed to me in any 
case that Gelmar needed a lesson in 
manners.” 

They stared at him. Then one of 
them laughed, and then they all 
laughed except the big man with 
the jealous eye who only showed his 
teeth. Yarrod said, “You may be 
the Dark Man at that!” 

The curtain of vines rustled as 
Breca returned. 

“A party,” she said, “is coming 
to the ford. About twenty of them, 
and in a hurry.” 



Y arrod reacted swiftly. “In 
here,” he said in Stark’s ear, 
and motioned to a fissure in the 
stonework at one side. It was barely 
large enough to accept Stark’s body 
and of no size at all to permit any 
motion, offensive or defensive. He 
hesitated. “Make up your mind,” 
said Yarrod. “Unless vou hide, 
we’ll have to give you up to save 
ourselves.” 

Stark accepted the inevitable. He 



slid himself into the aperture, 
which was screened within seconds 
by the meager possessions of the 
Irnanese — leather bottles, sacks of 
meal and dried meat, a spare shift 
apiece — and by the “pod” itself. 
For the Irnanese quickly huddled 
in their tight group before the heap 
of dunnage. Stark had some diffi- 
culty breathing, and he could not 
see anything, but he had been in 
worse places. Provided the Irnanese 
did not sell him out. He settled 
himself to endure. 

Soon Gelmar entered the vault. 
Stark could hear him quite clearly, 
speaking to Yarrod. 

“May your people know peace 
and quick fulfillment, Master. I am 
Gelmar of Skeg.” 

Courtesy required that Yarrod 
should identify himself in turn. He 
did so, giving a totally false name 
and place of origin, and ending 
with a gravely unctuous, “What 
may I do for you, my- son?” 

“Has anyone passed this way? A 
man, an off-worlder, fresh from the 
sea, perhaps hurt?” 

“No,” said Yarrod, his voice 
steady and unconcerned. “I’ve seen 
no one. Besides, who escapes from 
the sea? I’ve heard the Children 
hunting within the hour.” 

“Perhaps the Master is lying,” 
said a girl’s voice spitefully, and 
Stark knew it well. “The Master 
was at the ford. He saw us.” 

“And your people threw stones,” 
said Yarrod sternly. “My pod 
became frightened. It has cost me 



20 



IF 




much effort to calm it.- Even Farers 
should have more respect.” 

“One must forgive them,” said 
Gelmar. “They are the children of 
the Lords Protector. Do you lack 
for anything? Food? Wine?” 
“There is enough. Perhaps to- 
morrow I shall go to Skeg and 
ask.” 

“Provisions will be given gladly.” 
There were some parting formal- 
ities. Gelmar and the girl appar- 
ently left the vault, and in a mo- 
ment Stark could hear whoops and 
cries as the Farers went haring 
away through the ruins. 

Looking for me, he thought, and 
was glad of his hiding place. A 
sorry rabble they were but one 
against twenty, and the one unarm- 
ed, were unpleasant odds. Would 
they return? Stark stayed in the 
crevice. 

Yarrod took no chances either. 
He began to lead his pod in a kind 
of litany, a murmurous chant that 
almost put Stark to sleep. 

The chanting faded gently to a 
small contented humming — and, 
sure enough, then there were voices 
and sounds outside. 

Yarrod’s words came through 
clearly. “You didn’t find him?” 
Rather distantly, Gelmar an- 
swered, “No trace. But the Chil- 
dren have been on the bar.” 

“No doubt they have already 
shared him, then.” 

“No doubt. Still, if you should 
see him . The man is a law- 
breaker, and dangerous. He laid 



hands on me. Imagine! Being an 
off-worlder he might not respect 
your robe either.” 

“I have no fear, my son,” said 
Yarrod. “What do we all wish for 
but fulfillment?” 

“Ah — death,’’ said Gelmar. 
“Good night, Master.” 

“Good night. And please to take 
your unruly flock with you. Each 
time the tranquility of my pod is 
disturbed, the day of release is that 
much delayed.” 

Stark heard Gelmar’s footfalls 
departing. The commotion outside 
dwindled to silence. 

After what seemed an intermin- 
able wait, Yarrod and the others 
dismantled the pile of bundles. 
“Keep your voice down,” he cau- 
tioned. “I think Gelmar left a few 
behind. It’s like trying to count ver- 
min so I can’t be sure, but I didn’t 
see the girl go.” 

Stark stood up and stretched. 
The pod had broken up and the 
woman Breca was missing, pre- 
sumably on watch. 

“Now then,” said Yarrod 
brusquely. “We of the pod have a 
decision to make.” 

They all eyed Stark. 

“You believe he is the Dark 
Man?” That from the big Irnanese 
who had spoken skeptically before. 

“I think it likely. Gelmar ap- 
peared certain.” 

“But suppose he is not the Dark 
Man. Suppose we rush back to 
Irnan only to learn as much. Then 
all our work is wasted and our

mission is thrown away for noth- 
ing.” 

There were mutters of assent. 
“You have a point, Halk. What 
do you suggest?” 

“That we let him get to Irnan by 
himself. If he is truly the Dark 
Man, he’ll make it.” 

“I don’t particularly want to go 
to Irnan,’’ remarked Stark, with a 
certain dangerous cheerfulness. 
“Ashton’s not there.” 

“And well we know that,” said 
Yarrod. “Where is he?” 

“In the Citadel of the Lords Pro- 
tector, at Worldheart — wherever 
that is.” 

“North, in any case,’’ said 
Yarrod. “And in any case, you 
must go to Irnan.” 

“Why?” 

“So that Gerrith, the daughter of 
Gerrith, may say if you are truly the 
Dark Man of the prophecy.” 

“Oh. Gerrith had a daughter.” 
“All wise women have daughters 
if they can possibly manage it. 
Otherwise the precious genes are 
lost. And you see, Stark, we must 
know for sure or we cannot follow 
you. And without us and our help, 
you would find it hard to accom- 
plish your mission.” 

4i He’ll find it hard anyway,” said 
Halk. “But he might as well coop- 
erate.” He spoke directly to Stark. 
“You can’t get away from Skaith 
now. Not through the starport. And 
there is no other way.” 

“Since I have no wish to leave, it 
scarcely matters, does it?” Stark 



turned to Yarrod. “Maybe I can 
solve the immediate problem. Ob- 
viously you couldn’t have come here 
to rescue me, so you must have had 
another reason. What was it?” 

“We of Irnan,” Yarrod replied 
angrily, “are no longer allowed to 
travel without a special permit from, 
the Wandsmen, and we didn’t 
think they would give us one for 
this journey. That’s why we’re flap- 
ping about in this silly pod disguise. 
We came to Skeg to perhaps find 
out what the Galactic Union in- 
tends to do about us, if anything. I 
don’t suppose they told you at 
Pax?” 

“As a matter of fact, they did.” 

The whole group moved a step 
closer. 

“What will they do? Will they 
send someone?” 

“They have sent someone,” 
Stark said. “Me.” 

A stutined silence. Then Halk 
asked, “Officially?” The sneer was 
audible. 

“No. They tried officially to re- 
open contact with Skaith, and got 
nowhere.” 

“So they sent you. Who is your 
master, then?” 

Stark took Halk’s meaning and 
grinned. “No one. I’m a mercenary 
by trade. Since I was going after 
Ashton anyway, the Minister asked 
me to find out what I could here 
and report to him — if I survived. I 
take no orders from him and he 
takes no responsibility for me.” 

“Then,” said Yarrod, “that is 



22 



IF 




the best we can hope for?” 

‘‘Short of an invasion, yes. And 
the Galactic Union dislikes force. 
So if you want freedom you’ll have 
to fight for it yourselves.” Stark 
shrugged. ‘‘You must be aware that 
Skaith is not considered the most 
important planet in the galaxy.” 
‘‘Except by us who are obliged to 
live on it,” said Yarrod. “Very well, 
then. We go back to Irnan. 
Agreed?” 

Even Halk had to admit that they 
had got what they came for — news 
of Pax’s intentions, satisfactory or 
not. No justification remained for 
lingering at Skeg. 

“Yet we mustn’t go too quickly,” 
said Yarrod, frowning. “That 
would give us away. Gelmar will ex- 
pect me in Skeg tomorrow, and 
surely he is keeping some sort of 
watch on this side of the river.” 
Halk said sarcastically, “And 
what about the grand ambassador? 
We can hardly add him to the 
pod.” 

“He must go on ahead of us, to- 
night. He can wait at the . .” 
Breca came quickly through the 
vines, motioning for silence. “I 
hear them, coming this way.” 
“Stark . .” 

“Not in that hole again, thank 
you. It was a good hole and wel- 
come at the time, but it can entrap 
me. Did they search the roof?” 
“They did.” The pod began or- 
ganizing itself, soundlessly and in 
haste. 

“Then they’ll likely not bother 

THE GINGER STAR 



again.” Stark went out through the 
rearward arch, letting the vines fall 
back quietly into place. He stood 
for a moment, head cocked. He 
could hear people moving about 
some distance away. If they thought 
they were being stealthy they were 
much mistaken. The beautiful sky 
glowed with its islands of milky 
fire. In the cluster-light, Stark 
studied the broken masonry of the 
vault and then began to climb. 

IV 

T he top of the vault offered rea- 
sonable cover behind crumbling 
bits of wall still standing above its 
edges. He had no more than settled 
himself when Baya and two men 
came in view. She was leading the 
others, both of them obviously 
bored and as pettish as babies. One 
was tall and spindly, totally naked 
except for body- paint that looked 
as though he had rolled in it. His 
hair and beard were full of rubbish. 
The other man was shorter and ran 
to fat, and that was all Stark could 
see of him because he was com- 
pletely wrapped in bright cloth that 
covered even his face. The folds 
were stuck full of flowers. 

“Let’s go back now, Baya,” said 
the tall one, turning toward the 
ford. “You’ve seen there’s no one 
here.” 

“The Dark Man died in the sea,” 
said the shorter one, his voice 
squeaking impatiently through his 
veils. “The Children shared him. 

23 




How could it be otherwise?” 

Baya lifted her shoulders as 
though a breath of col(J air had 
touched her. She shook her head. 

‘‘I spoke to him,” she said. ‘‘I 
touched him. There was something 
about him — strength, a terrible 
strength. He killed a Child of the 
Sea, remember?” 

So they knew that, did they? 
Stark listened the harder. 

“You’re being silly,” said the 
short one, and hopped up and 
down like a rabbit. “Girl-silly. You 
saw his muscles, and you want him 
to be alive. You’re sorry he didn’t 
love you before he died.” 

“Hold your tongue,” said Baya. 
“Maybe he’s dead and maybe he 
isn’t — but if he isn’t, someone is 
hiding him. Stop whining and look 
around.” 

“We’ve already searched every- 
where . 

The tall man sighed. ‘‘We’d 
better do as she says. You know 
what a terrible temper she has.” 
They wandered off, out of Stark’s 
sight but not out of his hearing. 
Baya continued to stand where she 
was, frowning at the firelight 
flickering from the vault. Then she 
sauntered over, her insolent body 
agleam in the light of the Three 
Ladies. Stark lost sight of her too, 
since she was directly beneath him, 
but he could hear the vines rustle as 
she swept them aside. 

“Master—” 

Yarrod’s angry voice sounded 
from the vault. ‘‘You have no 



business here. Get out.” 

“But Master, I’m only curious,” 
said Baya. “I might even want to 
join a pod myself one day, when 
I’m tired of being a Farer. Tell me 
about them, Master. Is it true that 
they forget about everything, even 
love?” 

The vines swished as she entered 
the vault and let them fall behind 
her. 

The words from within were now 
too muffled for Stark to follow. In a 
few moments, though, he heard a 
squeal of pain from Baya and the 
vines thrashed wildly as she and 
Yarrod came through them. Yarrod 
had his hand wound cruelly in her 
hair. He marched her, crying and 
struggling, away from the vault. He 
took her to the river bank and 
pushed her in. 

“You’ve done enough mischief 
for one day,” he said. “If you come 
near my pod again I’ll make you 
regret it.” He spat and added, 
“Farer trash! I have no need of 
you.” 

He left her and strode back to the 
vault. She stood in the shallow 
water of the ford and shook her 
fists at him, screaming. 

“You live on the bounty of the 
Lords Protector just the same as we 
do! What makes you so much 
better, you ...” She poured out 
obscenities, then choked on her 
own rage and ended up coughing. 

There was a sudden delighted 
outcry from among the ruins where 
her two companions were poking 



24 



IF 




around. She came up the bank. 

“Have you found him?” 

“We found love-weed! Love- 
weed!” The two Farers reappeared, 
waving handsful of something they 
had grubbed up, chewing greedily. 
The tall one held some out to Baya. 

“Here. Forget the dead man. Let 
us love and enjoy.” 

“I don’t feel like loving now.” 
She turned away, toward the vault. 
“I feel like hating. Pod-masters are 
supposed to be holy men. This one 
is full of hate.” 

“Perhaps it’s because we threw 
stones,” said the short one, cram- 
ming his mouth full. 

“Who cares?” said the tall one, 
and grabbed Baya by the shoulder. 
“Eat this, and you’ll feel like lov- 
ing.” He pushed some of the weed 
by main force into Baya’s mouth. 

She spat it out. “No! I must talk 
to Gelmar. I think there’s some- 
thing . .” 

“Later,” said the tall Farer. 
“Later.” He laughed, and the short 
one laughed, and they shoved Baya 
back and forth between them. The 
struggle seemed to pleasure them 
and hasten the action of the drug. 
Baya pulled the bodkin from her 
hair. She slashed the naked one 
once, not deeply, and they laughed 
some more and took the bodkin 
away from her. Then they worried 
her down to the ground and began 
beating her. 

The roof of the vault was not 
high. Stark came down off it in one 
jump. The Farers neither heard nor 



saw him. They were far too busy, 
and Baya was screaming at the top 
of her lungs. Stark hit the tall one a 
chopping blow at the base of the 
skull and he fell. Another blow, 
and the short one followed him 
without a groan, strewing the last 
of his flowers. Stark heaved the 
bodies aside. Baya looked up at 
him, her eyes wide and dazed. She 
said something, perhaps his name. 
He could not be sure. He found the 
nerve-center in the side of her neck 
and pressed it, and she was quiet. 

He saw that Yarrod had come 
out and was standing over him, 
looking like thunder. 

“That was ill-done,” cried Yar- 
rod. “You fool, who cares what 
happens to a Farer?” 

“You’re the fool,” said Stark. 
“You gave yourself away. She was 
going to tell Gelmar that the pod- 
master was a fraud.” He lifted the 
girl smoothly to his shoulder and 
stood up. 

“She saw you, I suppose.” 

“I think so.” 

“And these?” 

The two men had begun to snore 
heavily. They smelled of a sweet- 
sour pungency. Their mouths were 
open and smiling. 

“No,” said Stark. “But they 
heard Baya. About you, I mean. 
They may remember.” 

“All right,” said Yarrod, still 
angry. “I suppose it makes no dif- 
ference who’s to blame. The only 
choice we have now is to run, and 
run fast.” 



THE GINGER STAR

He looked across the river to the 
lights of Skeg and then went stamp- 
ing back to the vault. 

W ithin minutes they were on 
their way through the sprawl- 
ing ruins and into the jungle. The 
Three Ladies smiled serenely. The 
warm air was moist, heavy with the 
odors of night-flowering creepers, 
mud and decay. Nameless things 
scuttled and clicked, bickering in 
tiny voices around their feet. Stark 
adjusted Baya’s light weight more 
comfortably across his shoulders, 
and remembered with a pang of 
yearning the clean bitter corpse of 
Mars. 

“The roads are closed to off- 
worlders,” he said. “I suppose 
you’ve thought of that.” 

“You don’t imagine we came 
here by the road, do you?” Yarrod 
snorted. “We got out of Irnan by 
pretending to be a hunting party. 
We left our mounts and all our 
proper gear at a place on the other 
side of the hills, then walked in by a 
jungle path.” He squinted at the 
sky. “We can be there by tomorrow 
noon, if we drive ourselves.” 
“There’s a chance, isn’t there,” 
said Stark, “that Gelmar will think 
you’ve moved your people out 
because of the disturbance? And 
that Baya simply ran off? She 
stabbed one of her friends, you 
know.” 

“Of course there’s a chance. He 
can’t be sure of anything, can he? 
He can’t even be sure whether 



you’re dead or alive. So if you were 
Gelmar, what would you do?” 

“I’d send word along to be on 
watch — especially in Irnan.” And 
he cursed the name of Gerrith, 
wishing that she had kept her 
mouth shut. 

“She got her death by it,” said 
Yarrod curtly. “That should be 
punishment enough.” 

“It’s my death that I’m like to 
get by it that worries me,” said 
Stark. “If I’d known about the 
damned prophecy, I’d have laid my 
plans differently.” 

“Well,” said Halk, smiling his 
fleering smile at Stark, “if it’s a 
true prophecy, and you are a fated 
man, you have nothing to fear.” 

“The man who doesn’t fear 
doesn’t live long. I fear everything.” 
He patted Baya’s bare thigh. “Even 
this.” 

“In that, you’re well advised. 
You’d do best to kill it.” 

“We’ll see,’’ said Stark. “No 
need to hurry.” 

They moved on, following a quiet 
green star that Yarrod called the 
Lamp of the North. 

“If Gelmar does send word to Ir- 
nan, he’ll do it in the usual 
manner, by messenger, by the 
roads. Barring accident, we should 
be well ahead.” 

“If,” said Halk, “the Dark Man 
and his baggage don’t slow us 
down.” 

Stark showed the edges of his 
teeth. “Halk,” he said, “I have a 
feeling that you and I are not going 



26 



IF 




to be the best of friends.” 

“Bear with him, Stark,” said 
Yarrod. “He’s a fighter, and we 
need swords more than we need 
sweet tempers.”. 

That at least was true. Stark 
saved his breath for walking. And 
there was plenty of that for all of 
them. 

I t was daybreak and they had 
stopped to rest, high on the 
shoulder of a jungle hill. The 
dreaming sea lay far behind them, 
all its deadliness hidden by dis- 
tance. The morning mists took 
fantastic colors from the rising of 
the ginger star. The Irnanese faced 
eastward and each one poured a 
small libation. Even Baya bowed 
her head. 

“Hail, Old Sun, we thank you for 
this day,” they muttered, and 
sounded as though they meant it. 
Then Halk, as usual, spoiled the 
effect. He turned defiantly to 
Stark. 

“We were not always paupers, 
hoarding our little daylight, grudg- 
ing every scrap of metal so that we 
could still have a knife to cut our 
meat. There were ships on that sea. 
There were machines that flew in 
the air, and all manner of things 
that are only legend now. Skaith 
was a rich world once, as rich as 
any.” 

“It lived too long,” said Yarrod. 
“It’s senile and mad, growing more 
so with every generation. Come and 
eat.” 



They sat down and began shar- 
ing out meager rations of food and 
sour wine. When Baya’s turn came 
they passed her by. 

Stark asked, “Is there none for 
the girl?” 

“We’ve been feeding her and the 
likes of her all our lives,” said 
Breca. “She can do without.” 

Halk nodded approvingly. 

Stark divided his own ration and 
gave her half. She took it and ate 
quickly, saying nothing. She had 
been docile enough since regaining 
consciousness, going along on her 
own feet with only a small amount 
of whimpering. Stark, leading her 
like a puppy by a halter around her 
.neck, knew she was afraid. She was 
surrounded by people who made no 
secret of their hatred and with no 
protective Wandsman at hand to 
whip them into line. Her eyes were 
large and hollow. Her body-paint 
was a sorry mess, all sweated and 
smeared. 

“The old civilizations,” said 
Yarrod, around a flap of tough 
bread, “for all their technology, 
never achieved space-flight. I sup- 
pose they were busy with more 
important things. So there was no 
escape, for them or for us. No hope 
of it. Then suddenly there was talk 
that starships had landed, talk 
about a Galactic Union and other 
worlds. You see what that did to us 
after we learned the rumors were 
true. There was hope. We could 
escape.” 

Stark nodded. “I can see also 



THE GINGER STAR

why the Wandsmen would be un- 
happy about the idea. If the pro- 
viders start leaving, their whole sys- 
tem collapses.” 

Halk leaned toward Baya. “And 
it will collapse. For leave we shall. 
And what will you do then, little 
Farer girl? Eh?” 

She shrank away from him, but 
he kept on at her until he brought 
her deep anger flaring up. 

“It will never happen,” she 
snarled at him. “The Protectors 
won’t let it. They’ll hunt you all 
down and kill you.” She looked 
hatefully at Stark. “Off-worlders 
have no business here, making 
trouble. They should never have 
been allowed to come.” 

“But they did pome,” said Stark, 
“and things will never be the 
same.” He smiled at Baya. “If I 
were you I’d start thinking about 
learning to scratch for myself. And 
of course, you could always emi- 
grate.” 

“Emigrate,” said Halk. “Ha! 
Then they’d have to do more than 
just love and enjoy.” 

“Skaith is dying,” said Baya. 
“What else is there to do but enjoy? 
While one can?” 

Stark shook his head. “Skaith 
will last out your lifetime, and one 
or two more. So that’s not much of 
a reason.” 

She cursed him and began to cry 
furiously. “You’re wicked. You’re 
all wicked. You’ll all die just like 
that woman Gerrith. The Lords 
Protector will punish you. They 



defend the weak, they feed the 
hungry, they shelter the . .” 

“You can keep that,” said Halk, 
and cuffed her. She shut up, but 
her eyes still smoldered. Halk lifted 
his hand again. 

“Let her be,” said Stark. “She 
didn’t invent the system.” He 
turned to Yarrod. “If Irnan is as 
closely watched as you say, how 
shall I get in and out of the city 
without being seen?” 

“You won’t have to. The wise 
woman’s grotto is in the foothills at 
the head of the valley.” 

“You mean the daughter? Don’t 
they watch her, too?” 

“Like hawks.” And Yarrod 
added grimly, “We can handle 
that.” 

Halk was still looking at Baya, 
full of malice. “What will you do 
with her?” 

“Turn her loose, when her 
tongue can do us no harm.” 
“When will that be? No, give her 
to me, Dark Man. I’ll see to it that 
she’s harmless.” 

“No.” 

“Why the tender concern for her 
life? She is ready enough to take 
yours.” 

“She had reason to hate and fear 
me.” Stark looked at Baya’s tear- 
stained face and smiled again. 
“Besides, she was acting only from 
the noblest motives.” 

“Hell,” said Yarrod, “who 
isn’t?” 

When they had eaten they start- 
ed off again, pushing themselves to 



28 



IF 




the limit of endurance — which 
meant past Baya’s limit. Stark car- 
ried her part of the time, staggering 
with weariness and fully conscious 
of every ache bequeathed him by 
the late Child of the Sea. They 
climbed steadily and the ginger star 
climbed above them. About mid- 
morning they crossed the ridge and 
began going down, which was 
easier at first and then harder as 
the grade became steeper. The dim 
path switched back and forth 
across the face of the slope but in 
many places Yarrod led them 
straight down in order to save time. 

They did not quite kill them- 
selves. They did not quite reach the 
place they had hoped to attain by 
noon, either. Stark judged that Old 
Sun was at least an hour past zenith 
when Yarrod at last signaled a halt. 

They were in a dense grove of 
trees, the pale trunks grooved and 
ridged, the dark foliage shutting 
out the sky. Moving cautiously, 
Yarrod walked on with only Halk 
for a companion. Stark handed 
Baya’s leash to Breca and rushed to 
join them. The two were expert 
woodsmen, he noticed, making 
hardly a sound as they progressed. 
When they reached the edge of the 
grove they became even more care- 
ful, peering out from behind the 
trees. 

Stark saw a broad sunny mea- 
dow. There was a ruined tower 
some distance into it that might 
once have been a mill or part of a 
fortified dwelling. Two men in 



bright tunics and leather jerkins sat 
in the doorway of the tower, relaxed 
and at ease, their weapons leaned 
beside them. It was too far away to 
see their faces. Scattered about 
between the grove and the tower, a 
dozen or so rusty-brown animals, 
large and shaggy, fed contentedly 
on lush grass. There were no 
sounds except the natural ones: 
breeze rustling overhead, animals 
cropping. 

Yarrod was satisfied. He had 
expected no less. He turned to 
summon the others. 

And Stark caught his shoulder in 
a grip of iron. “Wait.” 

Where a moment ago there had 
been no sounds, now all at once 
there were a multitude. 

“Men. There. And there . 

It was plain far all to hear — the 
creak of sandal-leather, the clink of 
metal, the swift stealthy motion. 

“All around us, closing in . 

Y arrod shouted. The Irnanese, 
j[ aware they were.in a trap, began 
to run. Baya stumbled and fell, or 
perhaps deliberately lay down. At 
any rate, they left her. Voices called 
out peremptory orders to halt. 
There was a loud trampling of feet. 
The Irnanese fled out across the 
meadow toward the tower where 
their weapons were. Arrows flew, 
whickering in the bright air. Two 
Irnanese fell and only one got up 
again. They dodged in and out 
among the animals, now snorting 
and bellowing. Then Stark saw that 



THE GINGER STAR 



29 




the men in the doorway had not 
moved and he knew they were 
dead. 

The meadow stretched wide and 
naked in the sunlight. Suddenly a 
flight of arrows left the tower and 
stuck quivering in the ground. 

Yarrod stopped. No hiding place, 
no hope. Men were coming out of 
the grove behind, arrows nocked. 
More men came out of the tower, 
kicking the two bodies aside. A 
small rufous man led them. He 
wore a dark-red tunic and carried 
no weapon but his wand of office. 
Halk breathed one word, a name, 
and he breathed it like a curse. 

“Mordach!” 

Stark had made his own de- 
cision. Those arrows were long and 
sharp and he was sure that he could 
not outrun them. So he too stood 
and waited, having no wish to die in 
this meaningless place, under the 
ginger star. 

“Who is Mordach?” he snapped. 

“Chief Wandsman of Irnan,” 
said Yarrod, his voice breaking 
with rage and despair. “Someone 
talked. Someone betrayed us.” 

The men formed a wall around 
them. Mordach approached and 
smiled up at the tall Irnanese. 

“Ah, the hunting party,” he 
said. “In strange attire, and with- 
out weapons. Yet I see that you did 
find game of sorts.” His gaze fas- 
tened on Stark, who decided that 
perhaps he ought to have chanced 
the arrows after all. 

“An off-worlder,” said Mordach, 



“where off-worlders are forbidden. 
And traveling with a company of 
law-breakers. Was this what you 
went to find? Someone purporting 
to fulfill your prophecy?” 

“Perhaps he does fulfill it, Mor- 
dach,” said Halk wickedly. “Gel- 
mar thought so. Gelmar tried to 
kill him and could not.” 

Thank you, friend, thought 
Stark, and felt his guts tighten. 

Two men came up, supporting 
Baya between them. “We found 
her in the grove. She doesn’t look to 
be one of them.” 

“I’m a Farer,” said Baya. She 
fell on her knees before Mordach. 
“In the name of the Lords Pro- 
tector ...” She held out the end of 
the halter and shook it. “He took 
me by force all the way from Skeg.” 
“He?” 

“That man. The off-worlder. 
Eric John Stark.” 

“Why?” 

“Because he lived when he ought 
to have died.” Trembling with ma- 
levolence she glared at Stark. “He 
escaped from us, into the sea. You 
know what that means — Yet he 
lived. He killed a Child of the Sea, 
and lived. And I saw him.” She had 
strength and breath enough to 
scream, “He is the Dark Man of 
the prophecy! Kill him! Kill him 
now!” 

“There,” said Mordach absent- 
ly, and caressed her tangled hair. 
He considered Stark, his eyes 
hooded and cold. “So. And per- 
haps even Gelmar could be mis- 



30 



IF 




taken. Either way ...” 

“Kill him,” Baya whimpered. 
“Please. Now.” 

“Killing is a solemn matter,” 
Mordach said, ‘‘and salutary. It 
ought not to be wasted.” He 
motioned to some of his men. 
“Bind them. Securely, very secure- 
ly, and especially the off-worlder.” 
He lifted Baya to her feet. ‘‘Come, 
child, you’re safe now.” 

“Mordach,” said Yarrod. “Who 
betrayed us?” 

“You did,” said Mordach. 
“Yourselves. All your preparations 
took time and effort, and some of 
them were observed. You and Halk 
are known to be among the most 
active of the Emigration Party. 
These others were known to be as- 
sociates. When you all went off to- 
gether to hunt, we were curious to 
know what the quarry might be. So 
we followed you as far as the tower, 
then awaited your return.” His 
gaze wandered again to Stark. 
“You were bringing him back to 
Gerrith’s daughter, weren’t you?” 

Yarrod did not answer, but 
Mordach nodded. 

“Of course you were. And of 
course they must meet, and I prom- 
ise you they shall — openly, where 
all can see.” 

He went off with Baya, who look- 
ed back once over her shoulder as 
the men-at-arms moved in with 
leather thongs to bind the captives. 
They were of a type Stark had not 
seen before, having lint-white hair 
and sharply slanted cheekbones 



and slitted yellow eyes that gave 
them the look of wolves. Certainly 
they were not Farers. 

“Farers are only a mob, for 
trampling and tearing,” Yarrod 
said. “Wandsmen in the city-states 
like to have a little force of mercen- 
aries for the serious work, and they 
recruit them along the Border. 
These are from Izvand, in the Inner 
Barrens.” His head hung in shame 
and misery. But he lifted it fiercely 
when one of the mercenaries 
brought a halter for his neck, so 
that he might take the rope easily 
and with a semblance of pride. 
“I’m sorry,” he said, and would not 
meet Stark’s eye. 

And now it was Stark’s turn to 
wear a halter and walk behind in 
the dust while Baya rode. 

So at length the Dark Man came 
to Irnan.

I t was a gray city, walled in 
stone, set on a height roughly in 
the center of a broad valley green 
with spring. Mordach and his 
prisoners and his mercenaries had 
journeyed a long way north, leaving 
tropical summer far behind. All 
around Irnan stretched tilled fields 
and pastures. Orchards were in 
blossom, a froth of pink and white 
oddly tarnished by the light of the 
ginger star. 

A road led to the city. There was 
much traffic on it: farm carts, 
people going to and coming from 



THE GINGER STAR

work in the fields or driving beasts 
before them, traders and long 
strings of pack-animals jingling 
with bells. Stark noted a troop of 
mountebanks, a caravan of travel- 
ing scores of both sexes with bright 
banners advertising their wares, 
and the motley assortment of wan- 
derers that seemed omnipresent on 
Skaith. Mordach’s party went down 
the middle of the road, four 
men-at-arms riding in front and 
clashing short spears rhythmically 
against their shields. A clear way 
was made, and behind them the 
folk stood along the roadside 
ditches and stared and pointed and 
whispered, and then began to 
follow. 

Two Wandsmen, in green tunics 
that indicated their lesser rank, 
strode out of the gate to meet 
Mordach, a rabble of Farers follow- 
ing at their heels. Within minutes 
the word was running ahead like 
wildfire. 

“The Dark Man! They’ve taken 
the Dark Man!” 

More Wandsmen appeared as 
though from between the paving 
stones. A crowd gathered, clotting 
around Mordach’s party like 
swarming bees. The mercenaries 
drew their ranks tighter, until their 
rusty- haired mounts all but trod 
upon the captives. Their spears 
pointed outward, forming a barrier 
against the press of bodies. 

“Keep up, keep up,” shouted the 
captain of the Izvandians. “If you 
fall, we can’t help you.” 



They passed beneath the arch of 
the great gate. Stark saw that the 
stone was stained and weathered, 
the carvings grown dim with time. 
A winged creature with a sword in 
its claws crouched on the capstone, 
fierce jaws open to bite the world. 
The valves of the gate were strong, 
sheathed in cured hides as hard as 
metal. It gave on a passage through 
the thickness of the wall, a dark 
tunnel where every sound was 
caught and compressed and the din 
of voices was stunning. Then they 
were in the square beyond and forc- 
ing their way between market stalls 
toward a central platform built 
stoutly of wood and higher than the 
jostling heads of the mob. Some of 
the mercenaries stood guard while 
others dismounted and hurried the 
captives up a flight of steps. 

Atop the platform were stalwart 
posts, permanently placed and 
black with use. Quickly Stark and 
Yarrod and the others were bound 
to them. The mercenaries took up 
stations at the edges of the plat- 
form, facing outward. The two 
Wandsmen in green went away; ap- 
parently Mordach had sent them 
on some errand. Mordach himself 
addressed the crowd. Much of what 
he said was drowned by shouts and 
howls but there was little doubt 
about the burden of his speech. 
Irnan had sinned, and the guilty 
were about to pay. 

Stark flexed himself against the 
hide ropes. They cut his flesh but 
did not give. The post was firm as a

IF 




tree. He leaned back against it, eas- 
ing himself as much as possible, 
and looked at this place where pre- 
sumably he was about to die. 

“What do you think now, Dark 
Man?” asked Halk. He was bound 
to the post on Stark’s left, Yarrod 
on Stark’s right. 

“I think,” said Stark, “that we’ll 
soon know whether Gerrith had the 
true sight.” 

The crowd was still growing. 
People came until it seemed that 
the space could hold no more, and 
still they arrived. Around the inner 
sides of the square stood buildings 
of stone< narrow and high, shoul- 
dering together, slate roofs peaked 
and shining in the sun. The supper 
windows were filled with onlookers. 
After a while there were folk 
straddling the rooftrees and perch- 
ing on the gutters, and the tops of 
the outer walls were packed. 

Stark noticed two distinct ele- 
ments in the crowd, and they 
seemed not to mingle. Foremost 
around the platform, doing all the 
screaming, were the Farers and the 
other flotsam. Beyond them, and 
quite quiet, were the people of 
Irnan. 

“Any hope from those?” asked 
Stark. 

Yarrod tried to shrug. “Not all of 
them are with us. Our people have 
lived in this place a long time and 
the roots go deep. And Skaith, for 
all its faults, is the only world we 
know. Some find the idea of leaving 
it frightening and blasphemous. 



They won’t lift a hand to help us. 
About the others . I don’t know. 
After all, what can they do for us?” 
Mordach was urging the mob to 
be patient. Still they pushed, many 
clamoring for blood. A band of 
women forced their way to the steps 
and began to climb. They wore 
black bags over their heads, bags 
that covered their faces. Otherwise 
they were naked and their skin was 
like tree-bark with long exposure. 

“Give us the Dark Man, Mor- 
dach!” they cried. “Let us take him 
to the mountain top and feed his 
strength to Old Sun!” 

Mordach held up his staff to halt 
them, spoke to them gently. 

Stark asked, “What are they?” 
“They live wild in the mountains. 
Once in a while, when they get hun- 
gry, they come in. They worship the 
sun, and any man they can manage 
to capture they sacrifice. They be- 
lieve that they alone keep Old Sun 
alive.” Halk laughed. “Look at the 
greedy beasts! They’d like to have 
all of us.” 

Arms like gnarled branches 
reached and clawed. 

“They will die soon enough, little 
sisters,” promised Mordach. “They 
will feed Old Sun, and you shall 
watch and sing the Hymn of Life.” 
Gently he urged them back, and 
reluctantly they returned to the 
crowd. Then a tumult inundated 
the doors of one of the buildings 
overlooking the square. A proces- 
sion moved out from it, the green 
Wandsmen leading and a fringe of 



THE GINGER STAR 



33 




Farers flapping at the sides and 
rear. At the center Stark made out 
a dozen or so men and women in 
sober gowns, chains of office 
around their necks. They walked in 
an odd manner, and as they neared 
he could see that they were bound 
in a way that forced them to bend 
forward and shuffle like penitents. 

A low groan arose from the 
people of Irnan. Yarrod muttered 
between his teeth, “Our chiefs and 
elders.” 

Stark thought he saw the begin- 
ning of movement among the Ir- 
nanese. He hoped they would rush 
the crowd and rescue their leaders 
by force. That might trigger a 
general revolt. But the movement 
rippled and died. The procession 
reached the steps and climbed 
haltingly while the mob jeered. The 
elders were herded onto the plat- 
form and made to stand, and Mor- 
dach pointed his staff at them in a 
gesture of wrath and accusation. 

“You have done wickedness,” he 
cried in a voice that rang across the 
square. “Now you shall do pen- 
ance!” 

The crowd screamed. Many 
threw things. The citizens of Irnan 
stirred uneasily. They muttered, 
but still they did not move. 

“They’re afraid,” Yarrod said. 
“The Wandsmen have packed the 
town with Farers, as you see. One 
word, and they’ll start tearing 
Irnan apart stone by stone.” 

“Hell, the Irnanese outnumber 
them.” 



“Not the Irnanese in sympathy 
with us. And the Wandsmen hold 
hostages.” He nodded his red head 
at the elders standing bent in the 
sun. 

There was a smell in the air now. 
The hot, close and frightening 
smell of mob; mob excited, hungry, 
dreaming blood and death. The 
primitive in Stark knew that sweaty 
acridity all too well. The ropes cut 
him, the post was hard against his 
back. The ginger star burned him 
with brassy light and his own sweat 
ran down. 

Someone shouted, “Where is the 
wise woman?” 

Other voices took up the cry, 
howled it back and forth between 
the gray walls. 

“Where is the wise woman? 
Where is Gerrith the Younger?” 

Mordach calmed them. “She has 
been sent for.” 

Yarrod yelled at Mordach, “Do 
you plan to murder her as you did 
her mother?” 

Mordach only smiled and said, 
“Wait.” 

The crowd became increasingly 
restless. Bands began looting the 
market stalls, snatching food and 
produce. Wine and drugs passed 
freely. Stark wondered how much 
longer Mordach could control 
them. 

Then the cry went up from the 
gate. “The wise woman! Gerrith is 
coming.” 

An expectant quiet settled over 
the square. Hundreds of heads 



34 



IF 




turned, and it seemed as though 
the Irnanese all drew one deep 
breath and held it. 

Men-at-arms appeared, opening 
a way through the press. Behind 
them rolled a cart, a farm-cart soil- 
ed and reeking with the work of the 
fields. After that marched more 
men-at-arms. 

In the cart stood two Wandsmen, 
each clinging with one hand to the 
jolting stakes and holding with the 
other the tall figure of a woman 
between them. 



S he wore a great black veil that 
enveloped her from head to 
heels, a single shroudlike garment 
that concealed her face and all else 
save her height. Set upon her head 
and circling the veil was a diadem 
the color of old ivory. 

“The Robe and Crown of Fate,” 
said Yarrod, and the folk of Irnan 
let out their pent breath in a savage 
wail of protest. 

The mob drowned it in their own 
blood-cry. 

The cart crossed the square, 
halted at the platform steps. The 
woman was made to leave it and 
climb. The diadem appeared first 
above the level of the platform 
floor. It looked to be frail and old, 
and its ornament was a circle of 
tiny grinning skulls. Then there 
was the sway of dark draperies and 
Gerrith, wise woman of Irnan, 
stood before Mordach with the 
Wandsmen on either side. 



Because of the veil Stark could 
not be sure. But he thought Gerrith 
was looking past Mordach, straight 
at him. 

Yet she spoke to Mordach, and 
her voice was clear and sweet and 
ringing, without a hint of fear. 

“This was not well done, Mor- 
dach.” 

“No?” he said. “Let us see.” He 
turned from her, speaking over the 
heads of his Farers to the people of 
Irnan. His voice carried to the 
walls. “You of Irnan. Watch now 
and learn!” 

He turned again to Gerrith and 
pointed his wand at Stark. “What 
do you see there, daughter of 
Gerrith?” 

“I see the Dark Man.” 

“The Dark Man of your mother’s 
prophecy?” 

“Yes.” 

Well, thought Stark, and what 
else could she say? 

“The Dark Man, supposed to 
destroy. There he stands bound 
and helpless, waiting for death.” 
Mordach laughed heartily, as 
though he found these human 
lapses from reason genuinely amus- 
ing. “He will destroy nothing. Do 
you recant, woman? Do you admit 
the lie?” 

“No.” 

“Then you are no wiser than your 
mother, and your sight is no more 
true. Do you hear out there, you of 
Irnan?” Again his words carried 
far. And where they did not reach, 
other tongues took them up and 

35 



THE GINGER STAR 




passed them on. The whispering 
rose like surf against the walls, up 
to the windows and the rooftops. 
“Your prophecy is false, your wise 
woman a liar, your Dark Man a 
sham!” 

In one swift motion he ripped 
crown and veil from Gerrith. 

Astonishment, surprise, shock, 
outrage . Stark could hear the 
outbursts from the Irnanese beyond 
the delighted screaming of the 
mob. 

Gerrith stood tall and calm, as 
though she had expected to be thus 
denuded. And naked she was, 
smooth skin warm bronze with the 
sunlight on it and a thick braid of 
bronzy hair hanging down her 
back. Her body was strong and 
straight and proud, not flinching 
before the lewdness of the crowd. 
Nudity was commonplace on Skaith 
and hardly to be noticed, but this 
was different. This was a stripping 
of more than the mere body. Mor- 
dach was exhibiting her. He was at- 
tempting to strip her soul. 

He tossed the black veil to the 
mob and let them tear it to bits. 
The diadem he smashed beneath 
his feet and kicked the old yellowed 
fragments contemptuously away. 

‘‘There are your robe and 
crown,” he said. “We shall have no 
more wise women at Irnan.” 

This, too, she had expected. Her 
reply was ready. “And you will have 
no more Irnan to rob, Mordach.” 
She spoke with the tongue of 
prophecy, and the huge crowd fell 



silent. “The Crown has come with 
us from the old Irnan, all through 
the Great Wandering and the cen- 
turies of rebuilding. Now you have 
destroyed it and the history of 
Irnan is finished.” 

Mordach shrugged and said, 
“Bind her.” 

But before the men-at-arms 
could reach her she turned and 
raised her arms and cried out in a 
wonderful ringing voice. 

“Irnan is finished! You must go 
and build a new city, on a new 
world.” 

Then she submitted herself to the 
binding. Mordach cried cuttingly, 
“Pray do not go at once, people of 
Irnan! Stay a while and watch the 
Dark Man die.” 

Laughter swept the mob. “Yes, 
stay!” they jeered. “Don’t leave us 
now. At least wait for ships.” 
Yarrod, bound to his post, threw 
back his head. A harsh wild scream 
rose from him. 

“Rise up, you dogs! Rise up and 
tear them. Where are your guts, 
your pride, your manhood ...” 
The madness was on him, the 
madness that makes dead men and 
heroes. Mordach lifted, his hand. 
One of the Izvandians stepped up 
and quite impersonally thrust his 
short spear into Yarrod ’s breast. A 
clean and merciful stroke, Stark 
noticed, though he was sure Mor- 
dach would have preferred some- 
thing more lingering. Yarrod sag- 
ged against the post. 

“Cut him down,” said Mordach. 



36 



IF 




“Throw his body to the crowd.’* 

The tree-bark women com- 
menced a shrill chanting, raising 
their arms to the sun. 

Yarrod’s red head, cometlike, 
marked his passage. Stark pre- 
ferred not to watch what happened 
after that, though he could not shut 
out the sounds. He lifted his gaze to 
the walls of Irnan, to the windows 
and the rooftops. He was peripher- 
ally aware of Gerrith being bound 
to the post Yarrod had just quitted. 

At Stark’s other side, Halk was 
weeping. 

Mordach and the other Wands- 
men stood benignly watching their 
flock, talking among themselves, 
planning the next act, the dramatic 
climax of their lecture on the folly 
of rebellion. Many of the Irnanese 
were going now. They had their 
cloaks pulled over their heads, as 
though they could not bear any 
more. They melted away into the 
narrow streets around the square. 

Gerrith was speaking. “So they 
leave us,” she said. 

Stark turned his attention to her. 
She was looking at him. fler eyes 
were a warm gold-bronze in color, 
honest eyes, sorrowful but calm. 

“It seems that Mordach is right, 
that my mother’s prophecy was 
born of her own desires and not the 
true sight. So you will die for 
nothing and that is a great pity.” 
She shook her head. The bronze 
braid had fallen forward over her 
shoulder and the shining end of it 
moved between her breasts. ‘‘A 



great pity.” She studied him, his 
size and strength, the structure of 
his facial bones, the shape of his 
mouth, the expression of his eyes. 
She appeared full of regret and 
compassion. “I’m sorry. Why did 
you come here?” 

“Looking for Ashton.” 

She seemed astounded. “But. 

“And that’s what Gerrith pre- 
dicted, isn’t it? So maybe after 
all . .” 

She would have spoken again but 
he cautioned her to silence. The 
Wandsmen were still conversing. 
The men-at-arms had returned to 
their positions, looking disdainfully 
at the mob that growled and 
howled and bestially tore. Stark 
glanced again at the windows. 

Was he imagining . .? 

No longer were they crowded 
with watchers. The shutters were 
pulled to, but not closed, as though 
to hide what went on iff the rooms 
behind them yet leave a view of the 
square. There were still people on 
the roofs but not so many as before. 
And there was movement of a 
furtive sort behind turrets and 
chimney-stacks. Stark took a deep 
breath and allowed himself a small 
bit of hope. 

He also braced himself for 
action. 

Mordach came and stood before 
him. 

“Well,” he said, “and how shall 
the Dark Man die? Shall I give him 
to the Little Sisters of the Sun? 
Shall I let my Farers play with him? 



THE GINGER STAR 



37 




Or shall I have him flayed?” The 
tip of his wand traced lines on 
Stark’s skin. ‘‘Slowly, of course. A 
strip at a time. Yes. And whom 
shall we call to flay our Dark Man? 
The Izvandians? No, this is not 
their affair.” He looked at the 
Imanese elders standing bowed in 
their shackles. ‘‘It is their affair. 
They planned to desert us, to deny 
their duty to their fellow men. They 
fell into the error of selfishness and 
greed. The Dark Man is their 
symbol. They shall flay him!” 

The crowd was overjoyed. 

Mordach took a dagger from his 
belt. He thrust it into the hand of a 
graybeard, who stared back at him 
with loathing and dropped it. 

Mordach smiled. ‘‘I haven’t said 
the alternative, old man. The 
choice is simple. A strip of his skin, 
or your life.” 

‘‘Then,” said the graybeard, ‘‘I 
must die.” 

‘‘As you wish,” said Mordach. 
He turned toward the nearest man- 
at-arms. 

Stark heard the ripping thud of 
arrow into flesh, saw the feathered 
butt rise out of Mordach’s breast as 
though it had suddenly blossomed 
there. Mordach drew in one shock- 
ed breath, a kind of inverted 
scream. He looked up and saw all 
the shuttered windows opening and 
men with bows standing in them. 
He saw the shafts beginning to pour 
like rain, and then he went to his 
knees and watched his Izvandians 
drop, and his green Wandsmen. He 



turned his face to Stark and the 
wise woman, a face filled with 
horrible doubt. Stark was glad 
Mordach had that to take with him 
into the dark. 

The graybeard had been a warrior 
in his time. He touched Mordach’s 
body with his foot and said fiercely, 
‘‘Dog. Death to all like you!” 

More archers appeared on the 
walls, on the roofs. They were 
shooting into the mob now. There 
was a great squalling and shriek- 
ing, a mighty surge of panic. 

Stark saw a body of mercenaries 
come in from the gate. At the same 
time, from the side streets, citizens 
of Irnan were streaming back into 
the square, armed with anything 
they could get their hands on. 
Among them was one group, well 
armed and keeping close order, 
that cut their way through the pack 
with ruthless efficiency, heading for 
the platform. They gained it. A few 
stayed to hold the steps. The others 
hustled the elders down and cut the 
captives loose. Stark and the 
survivors of Yarrod’s band caught 
up weapons from the dead Izvan- 
dians. They rushed down the steps 
and closed ranks around Gerrith 
and the elders. They started to fight 
their way back into the streets. 

Some of the Farers, crazy with 
drugs and fanatic hatred, rushed 
the group, careless of the swords. 
The Irnanese cried, ‘‘Yarrod! Yar- 
rod!” It got to be a chant. They 
killed their way across the square to 
the rhythm of it.

IF 




They passed into a narrow street 
between buildings of gray stone 
that had grown up during the cen- 
turies and then grown together 
overhead, so that in some places 
the street was more like a tunnel. It 
was quiet here. They hurried on, as 
rapidly as the elders could move, 
and presently entered a doorway. 
Beyond it was a hall of some size, 
hung with banners and furnished 
with one great table and a row of 
massive chairs. People were gath- 
ered there. Immediately the elders 
were helped to the chairs. Some- 
body shouted. 

“Armorer! Come here and get 
these shackles off.” 

A swordsman had brought a 
cloak to Gerrith and covered her 
with it. She was standing beside 
Stark. She turned to him with a fey 
look and spoke. 

“Mother always knows best.” 



VI 

H alk’s eyes were red with rage 
and weeping but his mouth 
smiled, all teeth and vengefulness. 

“They don’t need us here, Dark 
Man. Are you coming?” ' 

Stark glanced questioningly at 
Gerrith. She nodded. “Go if you 
will. Stark. Your bane is not in 
Irnan.” 

He wondered if she knew of 
another place where it could be. 

He went back into the streets 
with Halk. Bands of citizens were 



hunting down Farers like rabbits in 
the twists and turns of the narrow 
ways. It was obvious that the 
Irnanese had matters firmly in 
hand. Archers were taking up new 
positions around the great gate 
where scores of Farers were shriek- 
ing and trampling each other, 
fighting to get out and away. Stark 
saw no Izvandians. With their 
paymaster dead, he guessed that 
they had simply retired to their 
barracks to let the battle go on 
without them. The treebark women 
had taken refuge underneath the 
platform, more to escape the crush, 
apparently, than because they were 
afraid. They were chanting ecsta- 
tically, busy with the task of 
feeding Old Sun. The ginger star 
was feasting well today. 

There was really not much left to 
do. A few last pockets of resistance 
remained, and the work of mop- 
ping up of strays. But the fight was 
won — had been won, really, with 
that first flight of arrows. Mor- 
dach’s body still lay on the plat- 
form. The little man had pushed 
too hard. Take the folk whom 
Yarrod had said would not lift a 
hand to save him and his followers. 
Those reluctant ones had lifted 
both hands to save their elders and 
their wise woman, to cleanse them- 
selves of the shame Mordach had 
put upon them. 

Halk sallied on alone to exact 
still more payment for Yarrod. 
Stark could not see that he was 
needed anywhere so he put up his 



THE GINGER STAR

sword and climbed to the platform. 
Among the sprawled bodies he 
found the fragmented old ivory of 
the trampled crown. One little skull 
was still intact, grinning as though 
it could taste the blood that 
speckled it. Stark retrieved the 
skull, clutched it in his fist. He 
descended the steps again, the 
voices of the tree-bark women shrill 
in his ears. He hoped he would 
never meet a pack of them baying 
on their own mountain-tops. He 
made his way through the streets, 
returning to the council hall. 

There he found a bustle of mes- 
sengers, people coming and going, 
a feeling of urgency. Not seeing 
Gerrith anywhere, he tucked away 
the small skull in the rags of his 
tunic. He was wondering what to do 
next when a man came up to him 
and said, “Jerann asks that you 
come with me.” 

“Jerann?” 

The man indicated Gray beard. 
“The chief of our Council. I am to 
see that you have everything you 
need.” 

Stark thanked the man and 
followed him. They trudged along a 
corridor and up a winding star to 
another corridor, thence into a 
chamber with narrow windows set 
in the thickness of the stone walls. 
A fire burned on the hearth. The 
chamber had a bed, a chest, a 
settle, all heavy and well-made. A 
rug of coarse wool adorned the 
floor. A curtained alcove contained 
a stone bath reached by three steps. 



Serving men were waiting with pails 
of steaming water and rough 
towels. Gratefully Stark consigned 
himself to their care. 

An hour later he was washed, 
shaved and dressed in a clean 
tunic. As he finished the last of a 
solid meal, the man came again 
and reported that Jerann required 
Stark’s presence in the council hall. 

Freed of his shackles, Jerann was 
tall, erect and soldierly. He still 
wore that look of fierce pride but he 
was under no illusions. He was 
certain that the revolt would bring 
quick reprisal. 

“We are all fated men now,” he 
said. “We can only face boldly 
what destiny brings us. For good or 
evil, the die is cast.” 

He gave Stark a hard, measuring 
look. All the members of the 
Council were gazing at him thus. 
Stark knew what they were think- 
ing. Why an off-worlder? And what 
was there about him that had trig- 
gered this sudden stunning break 
from all history, all custom, all 
law? What had he bestowed on 
them, freedom and new life — or 
utter destruction? 

Stark had no answers for them. 
The prophecy had held only that he 
would destroy the Lords Protector. 
It had not predicted the subsequent 
effects. Besides, he had little faith 
in prognostication . 

“Eric John Stark, Earthman, tell 
us how you came to Skaith. And 
how you came to Irnan. And why.” 

Though knowing perfectly well

IF 




that Jerann had already heard the 
story Stark told it again, carefully 
and in detail. He told of Ashton, of 
Pax; he made a special point of how 
the matter of emigration stood with 
the Ministry of Planetary Affairs. 

Jerann said, “Then it seems we 
must believe in Dark Men and 
prophecies, and go our way in blind 
hope.” 

“What about the other city- 
states?” asked Stark. “They must 
be in much the same straits as 
Iman. Will they rise to help you?” 
“I don’t know. We’ll do what we 
can to persuade them, naturally. 
My guess is that they will prefer to 
wait and see.” 

“Wait and see what?” 

“If the prophecy is a true one.” 
Jerann turned to an aide. “Have 
the Izvandian brought to me.” As 
the man hurried away, Jerann said 
to Stark, “We must learn as soon 
as possible whether it is true or 
not.” 

There was a wait, an awkward- 
ness. A vacuum of uneasy silence 
within the encompassing sounds of 
triumph from the streets outside. 
The Council members were tired 
and showing strain. The enormity 
of the commitment Irnan had made 
this day weighed on them heavily. 

A knot of people came in, clus- 
tered around one tall lint- haired 
warrior. Stark noticed the gold 
ornaments on his harness, the 
torque and armbands. A chief, 
probably captain of the merce- 
naries. He was marched up the hall 



to where the Council sat, and he 
stood facing Jerann without emo- 
tion. 

Jerann said coldly, “Greetings, 
Kazimni.” 

The Izvandian said, “I see you, 
Jerann.” 

J erann took up a heavy sack 
from the table. “This is the 
gold owed to you.” 

“To my dead as well? There are 
families.” 

“To your dead as well.’’ He 
weighed the sack in his hand. “And 
there is in addition half as much 
again.” 

“If you wish to bribe us to leave 
Irnan,” said Kazimni contemptu- 
ously, “keep your gold. We have no 
further business here.” 

Jerann shook his head. “No 
bribe. Payment for services.” 
Kazimni cocked one pale insolent 
eyebrow. “Oh?” 

“Some of our people are going 
into the Barrens. A small party. We 
want you to escort them as far as 
Izvand.” 

Kazimni did not bother to ask 
why a party of Irnanese were going 
into the Barrens. It was no concern 
of his. 

“Very well,” he said. “Give us 
time to bury our dead and make 
ready for the journey. We’ll go 
when Old Sun rises.’’ And he 
added, “With our arms.” 

“With your arms,” said Jerann. 
He gave Kazimni the gold and 
spoke to the Irnanese escort, “You

heard. Give them what they need of 
supplies.” 

“Better to give them the sword,” 
muttered one of the Irnanese. But 
they took Kazimni away obediently 
enough. 

Stark asked, “Why Izvand?” 
“Because it is that much closer to 
the Citadel. And for that distance 
you will have the protection of an 
escort. From there you must make 
your own arrangements. I warn 
you — do not underestimate the 
dangers.” 

“Where exactly is this Citadel? 
Where is Worldheart?” 

“I can tell you where tradition 
puts them. The fact you will learn 
for yourself.” 

“The Wandsmen know.” 

“Yes. But none are left alive in 
Irnan to tell us.” 

So that was no help. “Where is 
Gerrith?” 

“She had returned to her own 
place.” 

“Is that safe? The countryside 
must be full of wandering Farers.” 
“She’s well guarded,” Jerann 
said. “You’ll see her in the 
morning. Go now and rest. It’s a 
long road you’ve come, and a 
longer one you’ll be taking to- 
morrow.” 

All night, during the intervals of 
sleep, Stark could hear the restless 
voices of the city, where prepara- 
tions were being made for war. The 
revolt was well begun. But it was 
only a beginning. He felt guilty for 
setting the peoples of an entire 



planet at each other’s throats just 
so two men, off-worlders at that, 
could escape from it. Still, there 
had been no help for it. Perhaps it 
would turn out for the best — at 
least from the standpoint of the 
Irnanese. 

Well, he thought, that was for 
the future and it was Gerrith’s job 
to look ahead, not his. He slept. In 
the dark morning he arose and 
dressed and was waiting patiently 
when the man came to summon 
him. 

Jerann was below in the council 
hall. Halk was there too, and 
Breca, and two others of Yarrod’s 
party. 

“I am sorry,” the old man said, 
“that Irnan cannot spare you the 
men you ought to have. We need 
them here.” 

Halk said, “We’ll have to rely on 
being quick and hard to see. But 
with the Dark Man to lead us^ how 
can we fail?” 

Stark, who would just as soon 
have gone on alone, said nothing. 
Food was brought, and strong 
bitter beer. After they had break- 
fasted, Jerann rose and said, 

“It is time. I’ll ride with you as 
far as the wise woman’s grotto.” 

The square was eerily quiet in the 
chill first light of dawn. Some of the 
bodies had been taken away. 
Others were piled stiffly, awaiting 
the carts. The tree-bark women 
were gone. Sentries manned the 
wall and the guard-towers by the 
gate. 




The Izvandians, about sixty of 
them, were already mounted, men 
and animals alike blowing steam in 
the cold air. Beasts had been 
brought for Stark and his party. 
They mounted and fell in behind 
the troop. Kazimni rode by and 
gave them a curt greeting. 

Old Sun came up. The gates 
creaked open. The cavalcade moved 
out. 

The road, so crowded and noisy 
the day before, was deserted except 
for the occasional dead. Some of 
the Farers had not run fast enough. 
Morning mist rose thick and white 
from the fields. Stark breathed 
deeply, relishing the fresh clean 
smell of growing things. 

He became aware that Jerann 
was watching him. “You’re glad to 
leave the city. You don’t like being 
within walls.’’ 

Stark laughed. “I didn’t realize 
it was so apparent.” 

“I am not acquainted with 
Earthmen,” said Jerann courteous- 
ly. “Are they all like you?” 

“They find me quite as strange 
as you do.” Stark’s eyes held a 
gleam of amusement. “Perhaps 
even stranger.” 

The old man nodded. “Gerrith 
said . .” 

“A wolfs head, a landless man, 
a man without a tribe.” Stark lifted 
his head, looking northward. 
“Earthmen killed my parents. They 
would have killed me too, except 
for Ashton.” 

Jerann glanced at Stark’s face 



and shivered slightly. He did not 
speak again until, at the upper end 
of the valley, they reached the wise 
woman’s grotto. 



a iLY Stark and Jerann turned 
aside. The cavalcade went on, 
moving at a steady walking pace 
that covered a surprising amount of 
ground without tiring the animals. 
Stark slid off the soft wooly-haired 
hide of the saddle-pad and followed 
Jerann up a steep path, coming 
finally to a hillside where naked 
rock jutted, forming rough pillars 
on either side of a cave. A party of 
men on guard there rose from 
around their fire and spoke to 
Jerann. The wise woman was 
within, and safe. 

Inside the cave was hewed an 
antechamber, where Stark sup- 
posed that folk must wait to hear 
the oracle. At the far end hung 
heavy curtains of some purple stuff 
that looked as though it had done 
duty for many Gerriths. These bore 
solemn designs embroidered in 
black. All in all, not a cheerful 
room. And cold, with the dusty 
tomb-smell of places shut away 
forever from the sun. 

An old woman parted the cur- 
tains and signed to them to enter. 
She wore a sweeping gray gown and 
her face was all bony sternness. She 
looked at Stark &s though she 
would tear him with her sharp 
gaze, rip away his flesh and see 
what was beneath it. 



THE GINGER STAR

“My old mistress died because of 
you,” she said. “I hope it was not 
for nothing.” 

“So do I,’’ said Stark, and 
stepped past her into the inner 
room. 

This was somewhat better. There 
were rugs and hangings to soften 
the stone, pierced lamps for light 
and a brazier for warmth. But it 
was still a cave. Gerrith looked out 
of place in it with her youth and her 
golden coloring. She was made for 
sunlight. 

She sat in a massive chair behind 
a massive table. A wide and shallow 
bowl of silver stood on the table, 
filled with clear water. 

“The Water of Vision,” she said, 
and shook her head. “It has given 
me nothing.” There were shadows 
around her eyes and her face was 
drawn. “I never had my mother’s 
gift. I never wanted it, though she 
assured me it would come in its own 
time whether I wanted it or not. My 
own gift is small and not to be com- 
manded at will. It’s worse than 
having none at all. Always before, 
at least, I was able to use the 
Crown, and I think something of 
my mother and all the other 
Gerriths down through the cen- 
turies lived on in it and could speak 
through it. Now there is no Crown 
and, as Mordach said, no wise 
woman in Irnan.” 

Stark reached beneath his tunic. 
“Maybe this will help you.” 

He opened his palm. The little 
yellow skull grinned up at her. 



Her face changed. “It is enough,” 
she cried. 

He handed the skull to her. She 
leaned over the bowl, holding the 
gruesome talisman between her 
hands. The water rippled as though 
in a sudden wind and then was still. 

Stark and Jerann waited. And it 
seemed to Stark that the clear 
water turned red and thick, and 
that shapes moved in it, shapes that 
raised goose-pimples on his skin. 
Gerrith was startled. “You saw?” 
“Something.’’ The water was 
clear again. “What were they?” 

“I don’t know, but they stand 
between you and the Citadel.” She 
stood up. “I must go with you.” 
Jerann had been standing in the 
chamber, observing. He said, “But 
Lady! You can’t leave Irnan 
now . 

“My work in Irnan is finished. 
Now the Water of Vision has shown 
me where my path lies.” 

“Has it shown what the end of 
that path will be?” 

“No. You must find your own 
strength and your own faith, 
Jerann.” She smiled at him with 
genuine affection. “You’ve never 
lacked for either. Go back to your 
people.” She turned suddenly and 
laughed at Stark. “Not so down- 
cast, Dark Man. I’ll not burden 
you with bowls and braziers and 
tripods. Only this.” She placed the 
small skull in a pouch at her girdle. 
“Know that I can ride and shoot as 
well as any.” She called to the old 
woman and disappeared through 



44 



IF 




the hangings into some inner 
chamber. 

Jerann looked at Stark. There 
seemed nothing to say. They nod- 
ded to each other and Jerann left. 
Stark waited, scowling at the placid 
water in the silver bowl and cursing 
wise women. Whatever it was he 
had glimpsed there he would as 
soon not have seen until met life- 
size. 

In a short time Gerrith returned, 
wearing tunic and riding cloak. She 
and Stark walked together out of 
the cave and down the steep path. 
The old woman stood in the cave 
entrance and watched them with 
eyes like cold-steel daggers. Stark 
was glad when the trees hid them 
from her sight. At the foot of the 
path a gnarly old man had brought 
Gerrith’s mount, with a sack of 
provisions tied to the saddle pad. 
She thanked him and bade him 
goodbye, and the two rode off. 

They caught up to the party 
around noon, Old Sun throwing 
brassy shadows under the rusty 
bellies of the beasts. Halk shrugged 
upon seeing Gerrith. 

“We shall have all the bogies on 
our side now,” he said, and his 
mouth twisted in what might pass 
for a smile. “At least we learn one 
thing. The wise woman has enough 
faith in her mother’s prophecy to 
put herself at risk.” 

T hey moved steadily toward the 
Barrens, at night checking their 
course by the Lamp of the North. 



At first the road ran among 
mountains. There were peel-towers 
on the ridges, falling down, and 
ruins of fortified villages that stuck 
to the cliffs like wasps’ nests. But 
the mountains were still inhabited. 
For three days a band of shaggy 
people followed them, going along 
their own secret trails parallel to 
the road. They carried crude wea- 
pons and ran with a curious loping 
stride, bent forward from the waist. 

“One of the Wild Bands,” 
Gerrith said. “They obey no law at 
all except that of blind survival. 
They even come as far as* Iman 
sometimes. The Wandsmen hate 
them because they kill Wandsmen 
and Farers as readily as they kill 
us.” 

The Izvandian escort was too 
strong to be attacked, and there 
were no stragglers. At night, be- 
yond the meager fires, Stark could 
hear stealthy rustlings. Several 
times the Izvandian sentries loosed 
arrows at things creeping toward 
the picket lines. They killed one of 
the intruders and Stark looked at 
the body in the light of morning. 
His nose wrinkled. “Why do they 
want to survive?” he wondered 
aloud. 

They left the heap of bones un- 
buried on the stony ground. 

The mountains dwindled to hills 
covered with dark, stunted scrub. 
Beyond, to the north, the land 
flattened out to the horizon, a tree- 
less immensity of white and gray- 
green, a spongy mossiness flecked 



THE GINGER STAR

by countless icy ponds. The wind 
blew, sometimes hard, sometimes 
harder. Old Sun grew more feeble 
by the day. The Irnanese were 
stoical, riding the cold hours un- 
complaining, wrapped in frosty 
cloaks. The Izvandians were com- 
fortable and gay. This was their 
own, their native land. 

Stark rode often beside Kazimni. 
“In the days when Old Sun was 
young,” Kazimni would say, and 
spin out one of the thousand or so 
legends he seemed to have at his 
fingertips, all telling of warmth and 
richness and the fatness of the 
land. The men of those days had 
been giants, the women beautiful 
and willing beyond belief. Warriors 
had had magic weapons that killed 
from afar, fishermen had worked 
magic boats that sailed the skies. 
“Now it is as you see it,” he would 
finish. “But we survive. We are 
strong. We are happy.” 

“Good,” said Stark on one 
occasion. “I congratulate you. And 
where is this place they call World- 
heart?” 

Kazimni shrugged. “Nprth.” * 
“That’s all you know?” 

“Yes. If it exists at all.” 

“You sound as though you don’t 
believe in the Lords Protector.” 
Kazimni’s wolf face expressed 
aristocratic scorn. “We do not re- 
quire them. It makes little differ- 
ence whether we believe in-them or 
not.” 

“Yet you sell your swords to the 
Wandsmen.” 



“Gold is gold, and the Wands- 
men have more of it than most. We 
do not have to like them or follow 
their religion. We’re free men. All 
the people of the Barrens are free. 
Not all of us are good. Some do 
business with the Wandsmen, some 
do not. Some trade with the city- 
states, some trade with each other, 
some do not trade at all but live by 
rapine. Some are mad. Quite mad. 
But free. There are no Farers here, 
and we can defend ourselves. The 
Wandsmen have found poor pick- 
ings among us. They let us alone.” 
“I see,” said Stark, and rode for 
a time in silence. “Strange crea- 
tures live in a place by World- 
heart,” he said at last. “Creatures 
not human, and yet — not quite 
animal.” 

Kazimni gave him a sidelong 
glance out of tilted yellow eyes. 
“How do you know that?” 

“Maybe the wind whispered it to 
me.” 

“Or perhaps the wise woman.” 
“What are they, Kazimni?” 
“We’re great talkers here in the 
Barrens. Great tellers of tales. We 
fill the winter nights with talk. 
When our throats go dry with it we 
wet them with cups of khamm and 
talk more.” 

“What are they?” 

“The Harsenyi nomads bring us 
tales, and so do the darkland 
traders. Sometimes they winter 
with us at Izvand, and those are 
good winters.” He paused. “I have 
heard stories of Northhounds.” 



46 



IF 




Stark repeated the name. 
“Northhounds?” It had a threaten- 
ing ring to it. 

“I can’t tell you if the stories are 
true. Men lie without meaning to. 
They tell, as though they had been 
part of it, a thing that happened to 
someone they never knew and only 
heard of by sixth remove. North - 
hounds are a sort of demon to the 
Harsenyi and to some of the trad- 
ers. Monsters that appear out of 
the snow-mist and do terrible 
things. It is said that the Lords 
Protector created them long ago to 
guard the Citadel. It is said these 
demons still guard it, and woe take 
any wanderer who stumbles into 
their domain.” 

Hairs prickled briefly at the back 
of Stark’s neck, just at the memory 
of those shapes *he had seen in the 
Water of Vision. He changed the 
subject. ‘‘So freedom is what makes 
your people content with life here in 
the Barrens — is that it?” 

“Is it not enough?” Kazimni 
jerked his chin contemptuously to- 
ward the Irnanese. “If we lived 
soft, as they do, we too would be 
slaves, as they are.” 

Stark could understand that. 
“You must have known what 
brought on the trouble at Irnan.” 
“Yes. Good trouble. As soon as 
we’ve rested and seen our wives, 
we’ll be back on the Border. There 
will be need of fighting men.” 

“No doubt. But how would your 
people feel about emigrating?” 

“To another world?” Kazimni 



shook his head. “The land shapes 
us. We are what we are because of 
it. If we were in another place, we 
would be another people. No. Old 
Sun will last us yet a while. And life 
in the Barrens is not so bad. You 
will see that when we reach 
Izvand.” 

T ihe road looped and wound 
among the frozen ponds. Other 
travelers were encountered though 
not as many as in the Fertile Belt. 
And they were of a different breed, 
darker and grimmer than the 
flotsam of the southern roads. 
There was a good deal of trade 
back and forth across the Border: 
drovers with herds for the markets 
of Izvand and Komrey, merchants 
with wagonloads of grain and wool, 
strings of pack-animals carrying 
manufactured goods from the 
southern workshops, long lines of 
great creaking wains hauling tim- 
ber from some far place in the 
mountains. Coming the other way 
were caravans bringing furs and 
salt and dried fish. All traveled in 
bodies, well armed, each lot keep- 
ing to itself. There were inns and 
rest-houses along the way but 
Kazimni avoided them, preferring 
to camp in the open. “Thieves and 
robbers,” he said of the innkeepers. 
And of the accommodations. “They 
are verminous. They stink.” 

The Izvandians moved rapidly, 
passing everything else on the road. 
Yet Stark sometimes felt as if their 
progress were only an illusion and 



THE GINGER STAR

they were trapped forever in the un- 
changing landscape. 

Gerrith sensed his impatience. “I 
share it,” she told him. “For you, 
one man. For me, a people. Yet 
things must go at their own pace.” 
“Does your gift tell you that?” 
She smiled at him. It was night. 
The Three Ladies shone through 
gaps in scudding cloud-wrack; they 
were in an unfamiliar quarter of the 
sky now, but still beautiful. Old 
friends. Stark had grown quite 
fond of them. Nearer at hand, the 
light of a fire flared and flickered 
across Gerrith’s face. 

“Something does tell me. Every- 
thing is in train now, and the end 
has already been written. We have 
only to meet it.” 

Stark grunted, unconvinced. The 
beasts, huddled together with their 
tails to the wind, munched at heaps 
of moss piled up for them. The 
Izvandians laughed and chattered 
round their fires. The Irnanese 
were wrapped bundles, suffering in 
silence. 

Gerrith said, “Why do you love 
this man Ashton so deeply?” 

“But you know that. He saved 
my life.” 

“And so you cross the stars to 
risk losing it on a world you never 
heard of before? To go through all 
this when you know that he may al- 
ready be dead? It’s not enough, 
Stark. Will you tell me?” 

“Tell you what?” 

“Who you are. What you are. 
A lesser gift even than mine could 



sense that you’re different. Inside, I 
mean. There’s a stillness, some- 
thing I can’t touch. Tell me about 
you and Ashton.” 

So he told her of his childhood on 
a cruel planet far too close to its 
sun, where the heat killed by day 
and the frost by night. Where the 
sky thundered and the rocks split. 
Where the ground shook and 
mountains collapsed. 

“I was born there. We were part 
of a mining colony. A quake and a 
great fall of rock killed everyone 
but me. I’d have died too, but the 
People took me in. They were the 
aborigines. They weren’t human, 
not quite. They still had their hairy 
pelts, and they didn’t talk much, a 
few clicks and grunts, cries for 
hunting and warning and calling- 
together. They shared all they had 
with me.” 

Heat and cold and hunger. 
Those were the most of it. But their 
hairy bodies had warmed his small 
nakedness in the bitter night, and 
their hard hands had fed him. The 
People had taught him love and pa- 
tience, taught how to hunt the great 
rock-lizard, how to suffer, how to 
survive. He remembered their 
faces: wrinkled, snouted, toothed. 
Beautiful faces to him, beautiful 
and wise with the wisdom of begin- 
nings. His people. Always his 
people, his only people. And yet 
they had named him Man-Without- 
a-Tribe. 

“More Earthmen came, in time,” 
Stark said. “They needed the food

IF 




and water the People were using, so 
they killed them. The People were 
considered only animals. Me they 
put in a cage and kept for a curi- 
osity. They poked sticks between 
the bars to make me snap and snarl 
at them. They were going to kill me 
too, when the novelty wore off. 
Then Ashton came.” 

Ashton the administrator, armed 
with the lightnings of authority. 
Stark smiled wryly. 

“To me he was just another flat- 
faced enemy, someone to be hated 
and killed. I’d lost all my human 
links, of course, and the humans 
I’d met had given me little cause to 
love them. Ashton took me in 
charge, all the same. I couldn’t 
have been a very pleasant charge, 
but he had the patience of moun- 
tains. He tamed me. He taught me 
house manners, and how to speak 
in words. Most of all he taught me 
that while there are bad men, there 
are also good ones. Yes, he did give 
me much more than just my life.” 

“I understand now,” Gerrith 
said. She stirred the fire. “I’m sorry 
I can’t tell you whether your friend 
is still alive.” 

‘‘We’ll know soon enough,” 
Stark said. 

He lay down on the cold ground 
and slept. And dreamed. 

He was following Old One up a 
cliff, angry because his feet did not 
have long clever toes, fiercely deter- 
mined to make up for his deformity 
by climbing twice as hard and twice 
as high. The sun burned terribly on 



his naked back. The rock scorched 
him. Black peaks pierced the sky 
on all sides. 

Old One slid without sound into 
a crevice, making the imperative 
sign. The boy N’Chaka crept in be- 
side him. Old One pointed with his 
throwing-stick. High above them 
on a ledge, its huge jaws open in 
sensuous languor, a rock-lizard 
slept half-lidded in the sun. 

With infinite care, moving one 
muscle at a time, his belly tight 
with emptiness and hope, the boy 
began again to follow Old One up 
the cliff . 

Stark did not like the dream. It 
saddened him even in sleep, so he 
started awake in order to escape it. 
He sat a long time by the dying fire, 
listening to the lonely sounds of the 
night. When he slept again it was 
without memories. 

Next day, in the afternoon, the 
party saw the roofs of a stockaded 
town by the shore of a frozen sea. 
With pride and affection, Kazimni 
called, “There’s Izvand.” 

VII 

It was a sturdy town, solidly built 
of timber brought from the moun- 
tains. Its roofs were steep to shed 
the snow. Izvand was the trade 
center for this part of the Inner 
Barrens so that there was a 
constant coming and going of 
wagons and pack trains. Traffic 
churned the narrow streets by day 
and at night the mud froze into 



THE QINQER STAR 



49 




ankle-breaking solidity. In the 
summer, Kazimni said, fishing was 
the business of many Izvandians. 
As soon as the ice went out of the 
harbor the high-prowed boats 
would be hauled from their winter 
sheds. 

“Not a bad life,” he said. 
“Plenty of food and fighting. Why 
not stay here with us, Stark?” The 
off-worlder shook his head. Ka- 
zimni shrugged. “Very well. This is 
the season for the darkland traders 
to start moving north. I’ll see if I 
can arrange something. Meantime, 
I know a good inn.” 

The inn had a creaking sign, 
much weathered, depicting some 
large and improbable fish with 
horns. There were stabling and 
fodder for the beasts, and rooms 
for the people. These were small 
and cold, each sleeping four in two 
beds, and they had lacked soap and 
water for a long time. The common- 
room steamed with warmth and 
sweat and the not-unappetizing 
odor of fish soup. It was good to be 
warm again, to eat hot food and 
drink local khamm, which was like 
sweet white lightning. Stark en- 
joyed these simple pleasures but 
after a while he rose from the table. 

Halk said, “Where are you 
going?” 

“I have a mind to see the town.” 

'“Don’t you think we had better 
be planning what we’re going to do 
next?” Halk had drunk quite a bit 
of khamm. 

“A little more information might 



help us decide,” said Stark mildly. 
“In any case, we’ll need warmer 
clothing and more provisions.” 

Without noticeable enthusiasm, 
the Irnanese contingent rose 'and 
fetched their cloaks and followed 
him into the chilly street. 

Halk. Breca, who was Halk’s 
shieldmate. Gerrifh. Atril and 
Wake, the brothers, two of Yar- 
rod’s picked men. Stark could not 
have asked for better. Yet the six 
were a sriiall handful against the 
north. Of what help could they be 
now? Not for the first time Stark 
considered slipping away from 
them to finish his journey alone and 
unencumbered. 

He was surprised to hear Gerrith 
say softly, “No. Me at least you 
must have with you. Perhaps the 
others as well — I don’t know. But if 
you go alone, you will fail.” 

“Your gift?” asked Stark, and 
she nodded. 

“My gift. On that score it is quite 
clear.” 

They wandered through a market 
roofed against snow. Smoky lamps 
and braziers burned. Merchants 
sat amid their wares, and Stark no- 
ticed that few were of Izvand. The 
pale-haired warriors apparently 
scorned such occupation. 

The market was busy. The party 
from Irnan meandered with the 
crowd, buying furs and boots and 
sacks of the sweet fatty journey- 
cake they make in Izvand against 
the cold. After a while Stark found 
what he was looking for, the street 



50 



IF 




of the chart-makers. 

It was a small street, lined with 
alcoves in which men sat hunched 
over their drawing tables, sur- 
rounded on three sides by honey- 
comb shelves stuffed with rolls of 
parchment. Stark strolled from 
shop to shop, accumulating an 
armload of maps. 

The group returned to the inn. 
Stark found a relatively quiet table 
in a corner of the common room 
and spread out his purchases. 

The maps were for the use of 
traders and in essentials agreed 
well enough. The roads, with inns 
and shelter-houses marked. Mod- 
ern towns like Izvand, pegs to hold 
the roads together where they 
crossed. Vestiges, here and there, 
of older roads leading to older 
cities, and most of these marked 
ominously with death’s heads. On 
other matters the maps were vaguer. 
Several showed Worldheart, hedg- 
ed about with many warnings, but 
each located the fabled city in a dif- 
ferent place. Others did not show it 
all, merely indicating a huge area 
of nothing, an area marked by the 
comforting legend : demons . 

“Somewhere in here,” said 
Stark, setting his hand over the 
blank area. “If we keep going 
north, sooner or later we’ll find 
someone who knows.” 

“So the maps don’t help much,” 
said Halk. 

“You haven’t looked closely,” 
Gerrith said. “They all show one 
thing — that we must travel by 



road.” Her fingers flicked across 
the wrinkled parchment. “Here we 
are blocked by the sea, and here by 
a mountain wall. Here again, where 
the land is low, are lakes and 
bogs.” 

“All frozen now,” Halk said. 

“Impassable even so. The beasts 
would be dead or crippled and we 
starving before a week’s end. So we 
must stick to the road. A road can 
be watched, guarded. Journeying 
so can be dangerous. But we have 
no choice.” 

“Besides,” said Wake, who al- 
ways spoke for the brothers, “there 
is the matter of time. Irnan may 
already be under attack. Even if we 
could make it by another route, it 
would take too long.” 

Halk looked around the table. 
“You’re all agreed?”^ They were. 
Halk tossed back another glass of 
khamm. “Fine. Let us go by the 
road, and go fast.” 

“There is another question,” 
Stark said. “Whether to travel 
alone or join some trader. A 
trader’s company would be saf- 
er .. .” 

“If you could trust the trader.” 

“. but we would be held to the 
wagon pace.” 

“We didn’t come this journey to 
be safe,” said Halk. 

“For once, I agree with you,” 
Stark said. “By the road, then, and 
by ourselves.” The others voiced as- 
sent. Stark bent over the maps 
again. “I’d give much to know 
where the Wandsmen’s road runs.”

“You won’t find it on these 
maps,” said Gerrith. “They must 
go up from Skeg to the east, across 
the desert. There would be post- 
houses and wells, everything to get 
them quickly on their way.” 

“And safeguards, doubtless, to 
make sure that no one can follow 
them.” Stark began rolling up the 
parchments. “We’ll leave at the 
fourth hour. Best get some sleep.” 

“Not yet a few moments,” said 
Breca, and nodded toward the inn 
door. 

Kazimni had just entered, in 
company with a lean brown man in 
a furred cloak who moved with the 
agile questing gait of a wolverine. 

“I’ll talk,” said Stark quietly. 
“No comment, no matter what I 
say.” 

Kazimni hailed them with great 
cheer. “Greetings, friends. Here is 
one you will be glad to meet.” He 
introduced his companion. “Amnir 
of Komrey.” The man in the furred 
cloak bowed. His eyes, gleaming 
like brown beryls, darted from one 
face to another. His mouth smiled. 
“Amnir trades far into the dark- 
lands. He thinks he can be of help 
to you.” 

Stark invited the pair to sit and 
introduced his party. The merchant 
ordered a round of khamm for all. 

“Kazimni tells me that you have 
an errand northward,” he said. He 
glanced at the heap of parchments 
on the table. “I see you have 
bought maps.” 

“Yes.” 

52 



“You were, perhaps, thinking of 
going on alone?” 

“Hazardous, we know,” said 
Stark. “But our mission is urgent.” 
“Better to make haste slowly 
than not at all,” said Amnir senten- 
tiously. “There are wicked men in 
the Barrens. You can’t know how 
wicked. Six of you — though all 
stout fighters, I’m sure — would be 
as nothing against those you will 
meet along the road.” 

“What would they want with 
us?” Stark asked. “We have 
nothing worth the stealing.” 

“You have yourselves,” said 
Amnir. “Your bodies. Your 
strength.” He bowed to the ladies. 
“Your beauty. Men and women are 
sold in the Barrens, for many pur- 
poses.” 

Halk said, “I think anyone who 
tried that would find us a poor 
bargain.” 

“No doubt. But why take the 
risk? If you’re captured, or killed 
resisting capture, where is your er- 
rand then?” He leaned forward 
over the table. Sincerity shone on 
his face. “I trade farther into the 
darklands than anyone because I 
am able to face the dangers there 
not only with courage, which many 
others have as well, but with pru- 
dence, which many others seem to 
lack. I travel with fifty well-armed 
men. Why not share that safety?” 
Stark frowned, as though pon- 
dering. Halk seemed on the point 
of saying something but Breca 
silenced him with a warning glare. 

IF 




“All he tells you is true,” Kazim- 
ni said. “By Old Sun, I swear it.” 
“The time, though.” Stark shook 
his head. “Alone, we can move 
much faster.” 

“For a while,” Amnir agreed. 
“And then . .” He made a chop- 
ping gesture with the edge of his 
hand against his neck. “Besides, 
I’m no laggard — I can’t afford to 
be.” 

“When do you leave?” 

“In the morning, before first 
light.” 

Again Stark seemed to ponder. 
“What price would you want?” 
“No price. You’d find your own 
food and mounts, of course, and if 
we should be attacked you’d be ex- 
pected to fight. That’s all.” 

“What could be fairer?” asked 
Kazimni. “And look you, if the 
pace proves to be too slow, you can 
always leave the wagons behind. Is 
that not so, Amnir?” 

Amnir laughed. “I’d not be the 
one to stop them.” 

Stark looked across at Gerrith. 
“What does the wise woman say?” 
“That we should do what the 
Dark Man thinks best.” 

“Well,” said Stark, “if if s true 
that we can go our own way if we 
choose to later on . .” 

“Of course. Of course!” 

“Then I think we ought to go 
with Amnir in the morning.” 

They struck hands on it. They 
drank more khamm. They arrang- 
ed final details and the two men 
left. Stark gathered his maps, led 



his party upstairs. They crowded 
into one of the small rooms. 

“Now what does the wise woman 
say?” asked Stark. 

“That Amnir of Komrey means 
us no good.” 

“It needs no wise woman to see 
that,” said Halk. “The man smells 
of treachery. Yet the Dark Man has 
agreed to go with him.” 

“The Dark Man is not above 
telling lies when he thinks they’re 
called for.” Stark looked around at 
them. “We’ll not wait for the 
fourth hour. As soon as the inn is 
quiet, we go. You can do your 
sleeping in the saddle.” 

In the star-blazing midnight they 
rode out of Izvand. The cold ribbon 
of road stretched north toward the 
darklands. They had it all to them- 
selves and made the most of it. 
Halk seemed consumed with a 
passion for haste, and Stark was in 
no mOod to dispute him. He, too, 
wanted to leave Amnir as far 
behind as possible. 

The land had begun its long 
slope upward to the ice-locked 
ranges of the north, and from the 
higher places Stark could keep a 
watchful eye on the backtrail. He 
could also sniff the wind and listen 
to the silence, and feel the vast sec- 
ret land that encircled him. 

It was not a good land. The 
primitive in him sensed evil there 
like a sickness. It wanted to turn 
tail and go shivering and howling 
back to the smoky warmth of 
Izvand and the safety of walls. The 



THE GINGER STAR 



53 




reasoning man in him agreed, but 
kept him moving forward neverthe- 
less. 

Clouds hid the Three Ladies. 
Snow began failing. Stark disliked 
the inability to see clearly; anything 
might come upon them out of those 
pale drifting clouds. The party rode 
more slowly, keeping close together. 

They came upon an inn crouched 
over a crossroads. It had a tall roof 
like a wizard’s hat, and one slitted 
yellow eye. Stark considered stop- 
ping there, instantly decided against 
it. By common consent they left the 
road and made a wide circle round 
the inn, walking the beasts care- 
fully so as to make no sound. 

Daylight was slow in coming. 
When Old Sun did show himself at 
last it was only as a smear of ginger- 
colored light behind a blur of snow- 
flakes. 

It was in that strange brassy glow 
that they came to the bridge. 

T Ihe bridge, the rocky gorge it 
spanned, and the village that 
existed solely to administer to and 
exhort for the bridge, were clearly 
marked on all the maps. There was 
apparently no way around that did 
not take at least a week of days, 
even without snow, and the toll 
seemed reasonable enough. Stark 
loosened his sword in its scabbard 
and dug some coins from the 
leather bag that hung about his 
neck underneath the bulky furs. 
The Irnanese checked their own 
weapons. 



In close order all trotted them- 
selves and their pack animals to- 
ward the toll-house, a squat blocky 
structure commanding the south- 
ern end of the bridge. An identical 
structure stood at the northern end. 
Each building contained a winch 
that raised or lowered a portion of 
the bridge floor, so that no one 
could force a way through without 
paying. You might take one toll- 
house but never both, and a part of 
the bridge would always be un- 
reachably open. The drop below 
was unpleasant, several hundred 
feet down past jagged boulders 
rimmed with snow and frozen spray 
to a vicious little river that drained 
some glacier-slope higher up. The 
village was built on the southern 
side, against the face of a low cliff, 
and strongly fortified. Stark guessed 
that the convenience of the bridge 
outweighed the nuisance factor and 
so generations of merchants had let 
it survive. 

Three men came out of the build- 
ing. Short broad men, ugly and 
troll-like, wearing many furs and 
obviously false smiles. 

“How much?” asked Stark. 

“For how large a party?” Small 
eyes probed the snowfall behind 
them. “How many beasts? How 
many wagons? The bridge floor 
suffers. Lumber is costly. Planks 
must be replaced. This is heavy 
labor, and our children starve to 
pay for the wood.” 

“No wagons,” said Stark. “A 
dozen beasts. What you see.” 



54 



IF 




Three faces stared in disbelief. 
“Six persons traveling alone?” 

Again Stark asked, ‘‘How 
much?” 

“Ah. Um,” said the chief of the 
three men, suddenly animated. 
“For so small a party, a small 
price.” He named it. Stark leaned 
down and counted coins into the 
grimy palm. It did seem, indeed, 
too small a price. The men de- 
parted chattering into the toll- 
house. They had some way of sig- 
naling to the other side of the 
gorge, and presently both sections 
of the bridge went creaking down 
into position. 

Stark and the Irnanese rode onto 
the bridge. 

Before they could reach the 
northern section of the bridge it 
shot upward again, leaving a large 
cold gap opening on death. 

‘‘All right then,” said Stark 
wearily, “we fight.” 

They turned, with the intention 
of bolting back off the bridge. A 
flight of arrows tore from slits in 
the toll-house wall and thumped 
into the planking in front of them. 

“Stand where you are!” a voice 
shouted. ‘‘Lay down your wea- 
pons.” 

A whole band of trolls, furred 
and armed, came waddling from 
the village. Stark looked at the 
nasty little slits in the wall, saw 
more arrows protruding at the 
ready. “I think we’re fairly caught,” 
he said. ‘‘Shall we live a little 
longer, or die now?” 



“Live,” advised Gerrith. 

They dropped weapons and stood 
where they were. The villagers 
swarmed onto the bridge, dragged 
the travelers out of the saddle, 
pushing, pummeling, laughing rau- 
cously. The beasts were led off and 
tethered to a rack by the toll-house. 
The bridgekeeper and his friends 
came out. 

“Six persons traveling alone!” 
The bridgekeeper guffawed, and 
lifted his hands to the brassy glow 
in the south. “Old Sun, we thank 
you for sending such fools.” He 
turned and pawed at Stark’s gar- 
ments, searching for the purse. 

Stark resisted a strong impulse to 
tear the man’s throat out with his 
teeth. Halk, who was being similar- 
ly handled, got his hands free and 
fought. He was immediately 
clubbed down. 

“Don’t damage him,” said the 
bridgekeeper. “All that muscle is 
worth its weight in iron.” He found 
the purse and slashed the thong 
that held it, then prodded at 
Stark’s chest with his dirty fingers. 
“This one, too . all strong big 
men, the four of them. Good, good! 
And the women . He cackled, 
skipping on his thick feet. “Maybe 
we’ll keep them here for a while, 
eh? Until we’re tired, eh? Look at 
them, lads, and their fine long 
legs . .” 

Gerrith said, “I was wrong. It 
would have been better to die.” 

And Stark answered, “Listen.” 

Faint sounds. In the distance. 



THE GINGER STAR

They swept nearer and now every- 
body heard. Rush of hoofbeats, 
jingle of harness, clash of arms. 
Riders materialized out of the 
falling snow. They came in strength; 
they came like the wind, their 
lances sharp and Amnir of Komrey 
at their head. 

The villagers turned and ran. 

“Stand! cried Amnir, and the 
riders herded them back, jabbing 
them painfully so that they hopped 
and screamed. The bridgekeeper 
gaped, Stark’s purse still in his 
hand. 

“You have broken the covenant,” 
Amnir accused. “The covenant by 
which we let you live. It is contract- 
ed that once a man has paid fair 
toll, he shall pass without let or 
hindrance.” 

“But,” said the bridgekeeper, 
“six persons alone . such fools 
are doomed in any case. Could I 
spurn the gift of Old Sun?” 

Amnir’s hard eyes looked down 
upon him. Amnir’s lance-tip prick- 
ed his throat. “That which is in 
your hand. Does it belong to you?” 
The man shook his head. He let the 
purse drop with a small heavy clink 
at his feet. 

“What shall I do,” asked Amnir, 
“with you and your people?” 

“Lord,” said the bridgekeeper, 
“I’m a poor man. My back is 
broken from the labor of the 
bridge. My children starve.” 

“Your children,” said Amnir, 
“are as fat as hogs and twice as 
dirty. As for your back, it’s fit 



enough for thieving.” 

The bridgekeeper spread his 
hands. “Lord, I saw a chance for 
profit and I took it. Any man would 
do the same. You can slay us, of 
course, but then who will do our 
work? Think of the time it will cost 
you. Think of the wealth you will 
lose.” He shuddered. “Think of the 
Gray Feeders. Perhaps even you, 
Lord, might make your end upon 
their hooks.” 

“It does not become you, at this 
time, to threaten me,” said Amnir, 
and thrust a little harder with his 
lance. Two large tears formed and 
rolled down the bridgekeeper’s 
cheeks. “Lord, I am in your 
hands,” he said, and wilted inside 
his furs. 

“If I spare you, will you keep the 
covenant?” 

“Forever!” 

“Which means until the next 
time you think you can safely break 
it.” Amnir turned in the saddle and 
shouted. “Back to your sties, filthy 
ones. Go!” 

The villagers fled. The bridge- 
keeper wept and tried to embrace 
Amnir’s off-side knee. 

“Free passage, lord! For you, no 
toll.” 

“I’m touched,” said Amnir. 
“And pray remove your dirty 
paws.” The bridgekeeper scuttled, 
bowing himself backward into the 
tollhouse. Amnir dismounted, 
walked over to Stark and his party. 
Halk, bloodied and furious, had 
been helped to his feet.

IF 




“I warned you,” said Amnir. 
“Did I not warn you?” 

“You did.” Stark looked past 
him at the riders, seeing how they 
had moved quietly to form a 
half-circle of lances that pinned the 
unarmed Irnanese against the end 
of the open bridge. “You must have 
ridden hard to overtake us.” 
“Quite hard. You should have 
waited, Stark. You should have 
traveled with my wagons. What was 
the matter? Didn’t you trust me?” 
Stark said, “I trust men little.” 
“You are wise,” said Amnir, and 
smiled. He motioned to his men. 
“Take them.” 

T Ihe Three Ladies were remote, 
withdrawn, scarcely showing 
their faces. The Lamp of the North, 
like a burning emerald, dominated 
the sky. The short days of the dark- 
lands were little lighter than the 
nights. Old Sun’s dull gleaming 
stained the sky rather than bright- 
ened it. The white snow turned the 
color of rust, and the vast plain, 
strewn with the wrecks of aban- 
doned cities, tilted upward to a 
distant wall of mountains all 
daubed in the same red-ochre. The 
line of great wagons creaked and 
crawled across this unreal land- 
scape, sixteen of them, canvas tops 
booming in the wind. From long 
before sunrise until long after dark 
the wagons rolled. When they 
halted they were deployed in a cir- 
cular fort, the beasts and the 
people within. 



Stark and the Irnanese rode their 
own mounts and were fed from the 
rations they had bought at Izvand. 
Amnir was delighted that trans- 
porting them was costing him 
nothing. Each mount was led by an 
armed rider. The captives had their 
fur-gloved hands bound and their 
fur-booted ankles tied together by a 
thong extending under the animal’s 
belly. The bonds were arranged ex- 
pertly to hold without impeding cir- 
culation so that the extremities 
should not freeze. 

Uncomfortable as this was it was 
an improvement over the first days 
when Amnir had kept them inside 
the wagons, away from curious 
eyes. There were other parties of 
armed merchants on the roads, and 
Amnir had .business at two or three 
centers were itinerant traders like 
the Harsenyi nomads brought their 
wares. These places were like 
blockhouses with crude shelters 
around them where travelers might 
find some respite from snow and 
wind. Amnir stayed away from the 
shelters. He seemed to have no 
friends among the darkland trad- 
ers. His men did not mingle with 
the men of other wagon trains but 
remained aloof and perpetually on 
guard . 

At the last of the centers there 
had been an altercation with some 
wild-looking nomads bringing in a 
string of shaggy beasts loaded with 
bundles. These people had called 
Amnir unpleasant names in a 
barbarous dialect. They had thrown 



THE GINGER STAR 



57 




stones and clots of ice. Amnir’s 
men had stood ready but no actual 
attack had developed and the wild 
ones had withdrawn once they had 
worked off their bad tempers. 

Amnir had not been disturbed. 
“I’ve taken away much of their 
trade,” he had said. ‘‘It was 
necessary to kill some of them. Let 
them gabble at me, if it gives them 
pleasure.” 

After that the caravan had left 
the marked roads, had gone off 
into this enormous emptiness. The 
wagons followed a dim and ancient 
track only apparent when it went 
through some cut or over a cause- 
way that showed an engineering 
skill long lost on Skaith. 

‘‘Once, when Old Sun was 
young, all this land was rich and 
there were great cities,” said Am- 
nir. “This road served them. Men 
didn’t ride beasts in those days or 
drive clumsy wagons. They had ma- 
chines, bright shining things swift 
as the wind. Or if they wanted to 
they could take wing and rush 
through the sky like shooting stars. 
Now we plod, as you see, across the 
cold corpse of our world.” 

But there was a note of pride in 
his voice. We are men, still, we sur- 
vive, we are not defeated. 

‘‘For what purpose,” asked 
Stark, “do we plod?” 

Amnir had refused to state what 
he intended doing with the captives. 
It was obvious from his pleased 
expression when he looked at them 
that he had large plans. Whatever 



they might be, no doubt Kazimni 
had had a part in making them and 
would share in the profits. Stark 
cursed himself for having been so 
careless. Kazimni had performed 
his agreed-on task honorably, 
getting the party safely to Izvand. 
Stark had neglected contracting 
with the man to get them safely out 
again. 

Knowing perfectly well what 
Stark was fishing for, Amnir smiled 
and evaded. 

“Trade,” he said. “Wealth. I 
told you that I trade farther into the 
darklands than others, and this is 
the way of it. Metal ingots kept 
appearing in the market-places of 
Korftrey and Izvand, ingots unlike 
any I had seen before. Ingots of a 
superior quality, stamped with a 
hammer mark. My greed is acute. I 
traced those ingots, back through a 
long and complicated chain of 
trade carried on by wild wanderers. 
Men died in that tracing, but I 
found the source.” 

He was riding beside Stark, as he 
often did, whiling away the long 
cold hours with talk. 

“The people of the ingots love 
me. They look upon me as their 
benefactor. Formerly they were at 
the mercy of many vicissitudes — ac- 
cident, loss, theft, stupidity, the 
haphazards of going through many 
hands. Now that I give them direct 
and honest trade, they have become 
so rich and fat that they no longer 
have to eat each other. Of course, 
because of this, their population is 



58 



IF 




growing. One day some of them will 
have to leave Thyra and find 
another city.” 

“Thyra,” said Stark. “A city. 
One of those marked with a death’s 
head?” 

“Yes,” said Amnir. He smiled. 

“But they no longer have to eat 
each other?” 

“No,” said Amnir, and smiled 
the wider. “Pray that we reach it, 
Earthman. There is worse be- 
tween.” And he added fiercely, 
“No great profit is made without 
risk.” 

Stark kept a watchful eye on the 
landscape. As they traveled farther 
he was sure that he saw, in the rusty 
gloom, pale things slipping furtive- 
ly behind hillocks and into ravines. 
They were distant. They were 
silent. Perhaps they were only 
shadows. In this light, vision 
became confused. In the moonless 
mornings and afternoons, one could 
be sure of nothing. Still, he 
watched. 

During those moonless hours the 
stars shone clearly, their light un- 
quenched by the ginger sun. Amnir 
would now and again stare up at 
them as though for the first time in 
his life he was thinking of them as 
suns with families of planets, other 
worlds characterized by other 
people and other ways. He seemed 
not entirely happy with the 
thought, and he blamed Stark for 
having brought it home to him. 

“Skeg is a long way from the 
Barrens. Here we had heard about 



the ships and the strangers but paid 
little attention. Indeed we never 
quite believed. It was too large a 
thought, too strange. We had 
enough to think about without 
that. Eating. Drinking. Begetting 
children. I have six sons, did you 
know that? And daughters as well. 
I have wives. I have family matters. 
I have property. Many depend on 
me for livelihood. I have matters of 
trade to consider, to judge and act 
upon. These things take up my 
days, my years, my life. They are 
quite sufficient.” 

“Are they?” Stark shifted in the 
saddle. ‘‘Are there no higher 
aspirations?” 

‘‘Like the Izvandians, we of 
Komrey are descended from folk 
who came from the high north, who 
did not wish to go farther south 
than was necessary to sustain our 
way of life. We remained in the 
Barrens by choice. We consider the 
people of the city-states, like the Ir- 
nanese, to be weak, corrupt.” He 
glared at the stars as though hating 
them. “One is born on a world. It 
may not be perfect, but it’s the 
world one knows, the only world. 
One adjusts, one survives. Then 
suddenly it appears that there is no 
need for such struggle — because 
one can emigrate to an easier 
world. It’s confusing. It shakes the 
tenor of existence, undermines the 
adaptations we have evolved. Why 
do we need it?” 

“It isn’t a question of need,” said 
Stark. “Other and better worlds 



THE GINGER STAR 



$9 




are available, and that’s a fact.” 

‘‘But it makes our struggles so 
pointless! Take the Thyrans. I’ve 
heard their ballads. The Long 
Wandering, Destruction of the Red 
Hunters, The Coming of Stray er — 
he’s the folk-hero supposed to have 
taught them how to work metal, 
though I suspect that there were 
many Strayers — The Conquest of 
the Mountain, and so on. The long 
dark years, the courage, the dying 
and the pain, and finally the 
triumph. And now we see that such 
sagas, such noble feats and forti- 
tudes, may never recur. Peoples 
may be able to run off to some lush 
planet and avoid all that.” Amnir 
shook his head. ‘‘I don’t like it. I 
believe in a man staying by what he 
knows.” 

Stark refused to argue this. But 
sometimes, while riding, Amnir’s 
curiosity would get the best of him. 
He' would ask how it was on other 
worlds, how the people ate and 
dressed and traded and made love, 
and if they really were human. 
Stark took a wicked pleasure in an- 
swering, unstitching Amnir’s self- 
assurance, opening up the wide 
heavens to show him wonders and 
satisfactions that astounded him. 

Amnir had a way of setting his 
jaw. “I don’t care,” he once de- 
clared stubbornly. ‘‘I am myself. 
I’ve fought my fight and made my 
place. I ask for nothing better.” 

Stark played the tempter. “But it 
makes you dissatisfied, doesn’t it? 
You’re a greedy man. Can you see 

60 



the great ships coming and going 
between the suns, bearing cargoes 
you don’t even have a name for, 
each worth more in money than 
your entire Barrens? You could 
have such a ship of your own, 
Amnir, just for the asking.” 

“If I set you free, you mean. If 
you succeed in your mission. If, if. 
The odds are too long. Besides — I 
am greedy, yes, but of some 
wisdom nonetheless. I know my 
small horizon. It fits me. The stars 
do not.” 

As a matter of policy, Amnir 
kept his captives apart. That made 
mischief more unlikely; he knew 
that escape was always on their 
minds. Stark could see the others, 
hooded and wrapped in furs like 
himself, riding their led beasts. But 
he had no chance to talk to them. 
He wondered what Gerrith would 
be thinking now about the pro- 
phecy. 

Halk made one desperate, ill* 
considered attempt to break away 
and after that was confined to one’ 
of the wagons. At night all were so 
confined. Stark was tied to the 
wagon frame in such a way that he 
could not bring his hands together 
or get at the tough thongs with his 
teeth. Each time they bound him he 
tested the thongs to see if his 
captors had grown careless. When 
he found they had not, he lay on the 
bales of goods that formed his bed 
and slept. His iron patience gave 
him a certain serenity. He had not 
forgotten Ashton. He had not 

IF 




forgotten anything. He was simply 
waiting. And each day brought him 
closer to the destination he sought. 

Repeatedly he inquired of Amnir 
about the Citadel. 

Amnir said, “All of you have 
asked me the same question. I give 
you all the same answer. Ask the 
Thyrans.” 

He smiled. Stark was getting 
bored with his everlasting smiles. 

“How long have you been trading 
this far north?” 

“If I complete it, this will be my 
seventh journey.” 

“Do you feel there’s a chance you 
may not complete it?” 

“On Skaith,” said Amnir, for 
once not smiling, “there is always 
that chance.” 

T jhe ruins became more exten- 
sive. In places they were no 
more than shapeless hummocks of 
ice and snow. In others there were 
stumps of towers still standing, and 
great mazes of walls and pits. 
Several sorts of creatures laired in 
the hollow places. They seemed to 
live by hunting each other. The 
more aggressive ones came howling 
and prowling around the wagons at 
night to put the beasts of burden in 
an uproar. 

Twice the wagons were attacked 
in force. It seemed that the squat 
ferocious shapes emerged from the 
ground itself, rushing forward in 
the rusty twilight, hurling them- 
selves at anything that lived, all 
teeth and talons and wild harsh 



screamings. They impaled them- 
selves on lances, spitted themselves 
on swords, and their fellows tore 
them to bits and devoured them 
while still they screamed. The 
armed men drove them off, but in 
each case not before some of the 
beasts had been pulled down in 
harness by swarming bodies and 
reduced to stripped bones in a 
matter of minutes. The creatures 
did not stop eating even long 
enough to die. The worst thing 
about it to Stark was that the over- 
powering stench of them was unde- 
niably human. They sweated the 
sweat of man. 

As they passed through a sector 
of particularly unappealing ruins, 
the shadows that slipped and slid 
along the edges of vision seemed to 
be keeping pace with the caravan. 
This they continued to do, Stark 
saw, for some miles. 

It was obvious that Amnir had 
been aware of them, too, and that 
he was worried. 

“You know who they are?” 

“They call themselves the People 
of the Towers. The Thyrans say 
they’re great magicians. The Gray 
Maggots, they call the tribe, and 
will have nothing to do with it. I’ve 
always paid them a generous 
tribute for passage through their 
city, and we’ve had no trouble. But 
they’ve never done this before, this 
spying and following of us. I don’t 
understand it.” 

“How soon do we reach their 
city?” 



THE GINGER STAR

“Tomorrow,” said Amnir, and 
his hand tightened on his sword 
hilt. 

In the dark morning-time, under 
the green star, they crossed a river 
of ice, threading the piers of a 
vanished bridge. On the other side 
a cluster of towers reared against 
the sky, jagged and broken in out- 
line. They were silent except for the 
whistle of wind through chinks and 
crannies. But they showed lights. 

The road ran straight to the 
towers. Stark looked at them with 
immense distaste. Ice glazed them. 
Snow choked their crevices, frosted 
their shattered edges. It was some- 
how indecent that there should be 
lights within those walls. 

Amnir rode along the line of 
wagons. “Close up there. Close up. 
Smartly now! Let them see your 
weapons. On your guard — watch 
my lance-point and keep moving.” 

The broken towers were grouped 
around an open circle. In its center 
squatted a huge lump of broken 
stone that might once have been a 
monument to civic pride. Three 
figures stood beside the monument. 
They were gaunt, tuck-bellied, 
long-armed, slightly stooped. They 
wore tight-fitting garments of an in- 
determinate gray color, hoods cov- 
ering narrow heads. Their faces 
were masked against the wind. The 
masks were worked in darker 
threads with what appeared to be 
symbols of rank. The three stood 
immobile, alone, and the ragged 
doorways of the buildings gaped 



darkly on either hand. 

Stark’s nostrils twitched. A smell 
of living came to him from those 
doorways, a dry subtle taint of 
close- packed bodies, of smoke and 
penned animals, of dung and wool 
and unnameable foods. He was 
riding in his usual place beside the 
third wagon in line. Gerrith was 
behind him, beside the fourth. The 
other captives strung out behind 
her except for Halk, who was still 
confined. Stark tugged nervously at 
his bonds, and the armed man who 
led his beast thumped him with a 
lance butt and bade him be still. 

The noise of the wagons as- 
saulted the silence. Amnir rode 
aside, toward the three gray figures. 
Men came after him bearing sacks 
and bales and rolls of cloth. 

Amnir halted and raised a hand. 
The, hand held a lance, point 
upward. 

“May Old Sun give you light and 
warmth, Hargoth.” 

“There is neither here,” said the 
foremost figure. Only his eyes and 
his mouth showed. The eyes were 
pale and unreadable. Above them, 
on the forehead of the mask, there 
was the winged-disk sun-symbol 
Stark had found to be almost uni- 
versal. On the sides of the mask, 
covering the cheeks, were stylized 
grain patterns. In Pax, Stark had 
read something of the sect. He 
supposed the man was both chief 
and high priest. It was strange to 
find a Corn King here, where no 
corn had grown for centuries. The 



62 



IF 




man’s mouth exhibited thin lips 
and small sharp teeth. His voice 
was high and reedy but it had a 
carrying quality, a note of author- 
ity- 

“Here there are only my lord 
Darkness, and his lady Cold, and 
their daughter Hunger.” 

“I have brought you gifts,” said 
Amnir. 

And the Corn King said, “This 
time you have brought us more.” 
The wind blew his words away. 
But Amnir’s lance dipped and a 
movement began along the line of 
wagons, a bristling of weapons. 
The man leading Stark’s beast 
shortened up on the rein. 

In a curiously flat tone Amnir 
said, “I don’t take your meaning.” 
‘‘Why should you?” said the 
Corn King. ‘‘You have not the 
Sight. But I have seen. I have seen 
it in the Winter Dreaming. I have 
seen it in the entrails of the Spring 
Child that we give each year to Old 
Sun. I have seen it in the stars. Our 
guide has come, the Promised One 
who will lead us into the far 
heavens, into warmth and light. He 
is with you now.” A long slender 
arm shot out and pointed straight 
at Stark. “Give him to us.” 

‘‘I do not understand you,” 
Amnir said. “I have only captives 
from the south to be sold as slaves 
to the Thyrans.” 

The lance-point dipped lower. 
The pace of the wagons quickened. 

“You lie,” said the Corn King. 
“You will sell them to the Citadel. 



Word has come from the high 
north, both truth and lies, and we 
know the difference. There are 
strangers on Skaith. The star-roads 
are open. We have waited through 
the long night and now it is 
morning.” 

As though in answer, the first 
sullen glimmer of dawn stained the 
eastern sky. 

“Give us our guide. Only death 
waits for him in the high north.” 
Stark shouted, “What word have 
you of strangers?” 

The armed men clouted him 
hard across the head with the lance 
butt. Amnir voiced a shrill cry, 
reining his beast around, and the 
wagons began to move, faster and 
faster, the teams slipping and 
scrabbling on the frosty ground. 

B ound so that he could neither 
fight nor fall, half unconscious 
from the blow, Stark saw the en- 
circling walls and dark doorways 
rush past him in a haze. He wanted 
the people behind those doors to 
come out and attack, to set him 
free, but they did not. The Com 
King with his attendants remained 
motionless beside the tumbled 
monument. In a few moments the 
whole clattering, jouncing caravan 
of wagons and armed men was 
clear of the circle and racing along 
between lesser ruins, lightless and 
deserted. By the time the ginger 
sun had dragged itself above the 
horizon they were in open country, 
and unpursued. 



THE GINGER STAR 



63 




Amnir halted the train to rest the 
beasts and restore order along the 
line. Stark managed to twist him- 
self around far enough to see 
Gerrith. Her face was white, her 
eyes wide and strange. 

The man-at-arms used his lance 
again, this time with less force, to 
straighten his prisoner in the 
saddle. Stark shook away the last of 
the haze from his vision and tried to 
ignore the throbbing in his head. 
Amnir was riding up to him. 

There was something peculiar 
about the man’s expression as he 
looked at Stark. It was plain that 
the encounter with the men of the 
Towers had shaken him. 

“So,” said Stark, “you meant us 
for the Citadel all along.” 

“Does that surprise you?” 

“No. But the Corn King -sur- 
prised me.” 

“The what?” 

“The man you called Hargoth, 
the priest-king of the Towers. He 
knew me. He was waiting. That’s 
why we were being watched.” 

“You will get little good from 
that,” said Amnir, and turned to 
the man-at-arms. “See that he’s 
put into the wagon. Now. And 
guarded well.” 

“Guarded against what?” asked 
Stark. “The people of the Towers? 
You cannot guard against magi- 
cians. Or the Thyrans. Maybe they 
would prefer to sell us to the 
Citadel themselves, without sharing 
the profits. Or the Lords Protector? 
Suppose they see no reason to pay 



you the price you’ve been rolling 
under your tongue ever since 
Kazimni talked to you in Izvand. 
Suppose they send their North- 
hounds to hunt us all down.” Stark 
laughed boldly. “Or are you, in 
spite of yourself, possibly beginning 
to think there may be something in 
the wise woman’s prophecy? If 
that’s it, hurry! See if you can 
outrun fate.” 

Amnir's eyelids flickered un- 
easily. He muttered something 
Stark could not hear, probably a 
curse. Kicking his beast with un- 
necessary viciousness, he rode off. 

Stark was shoved into the wagon 
and bound with even more care 
than usual. He lay staring up at the 
rough canvas of the tilt above him, 
hearing again the Corn King’s 
words. The star-roads are open. 
We have waited through the long 
night and now it is morning. 

Old Sun’s gingery gleaming had 
long since vanished when the 
wagon was wheeled into place for 
the night. Stark lay still, feeling a 
curious and probably unfounded 
anticipation. He listened to the 
sounds of Amnir’s men making 
camp. He listened to the fretting of 
the wind at the canvas. He listened 
to the beating of his own heart. 
And he waited. 

I have seen it in the Winter 
Dreaming. I have seen it in the en- 
trails of the Spring Child. Our 
guide has come . 

The noises of the camp died 
away. The men had eaten and 



64 



IF 




wrapped themselves for sleep, all 
but the sentries. There seemed 
more of the latter than usual, 
judging by the number of pacing 
feet. From time to time one of the 
guards looked in through the flap, 
making sure the prisoner was still 
safely bound. 

Time passed. 

Maybe I was wrong, Stark 
thought. Maybe nothing at all will 
happen. 

He had no clear idea what he was 
waiting for. A sudden attack, the 
swift rush of footsteps, shouts, 
cries . The watchers sent out by 
the Corn King had had no difficulty 
keeping up with the slow-moving 
wagons. Surely, then, the people of 
the Towers should be able to catch 
the train some time during the 
night. 

And suppose they did, come, 
suppose they did attack. Amnir’s 
men were disciplined and well 
armed. They were on guard. Could 
the people of the Towers overcome 
them? What weapons did they 
have? How well did they fight? 

If they were truly great magi- 
cians, they would have more subtle 
ways of gaining their ends. That 
thought made Stark laugh at 
himself. 

Magicians. He was catching at 
straws. He, who considered himself 
rational. 

The cold, he thought, was more 
penetrating than usual. It pinched 
his face. He worried about frostbite 
and tried to burrow his nose deeper 



into his sleeping furs, one. side at a 
time. The moisture of his breath 
froze on the furs, on his flesh and 
hair. His lungs hurt. He grew 
drowsy, and he could picture 
himself asleep and freezing gradu- 
ally into stiffness with a shining 
glaze of ice over him like glass. 

He was afraid, above all. This he 
admitted to himself. He fought his 
bonds. He could not break free but 
he generated enough heat to melt 
some of the frost that coated him. 

The moisture quickly froze again, 
and now it seemed to him that he 
could hear the cold, actually hear 
it. 

It sang. Each crystal of ice had a 
voice, tiny and thin. 

It tinkled and crackled, faintly, 
sweetly, like distant music heard 
across hills when the wind blows. 

It chimed, and the chiming 
spoke elfinly of sleep and peace. 
Peace, and an end of striving. 

All living things must come to 
that at last. 

Surrender to sleep and peace . 

Stark was still fighting feebly for 
consciousness when the back flap 
of the wagon-tilt opened and a 
narrow person snaked in lithely 
over the tailgate. Moving swiftly, he 
slashed Stark’s wrists and ankles 
free. He hauled him up, amazingly 
strong for all his narrowness, and 
forced a draught of some dark 
liquid down Stark’s throat. 

“Come,” he whispered. 
“Quickly!” 

Masked in plain gray without 



THE GINGER STAR 



65 




markings, the face swam in the 
gloom, unreal. Stark pawed his way 
forward, and the draught he had 
swallowed took sudden fire within 
him. He scrambled out of the 
wagon. The strong arm of the gray 
man steadied him. 

Inside the circle of vehicles the 
tiny hoarded fires guttered behind 
their windbreaks, dying. Bodies, 
animal and human, lay about, 
motionless under shining coats of 
frost that shone pale in the star- 
light. The sentries lay where they 
had fallen, awkward dummies with 
uplifted arms and stiffly contracted 
legs. 

Stark snapped, “Gerrith!” 

The gray man pointed and urged 
him on. 

The Corn King stood on a small 
eminence beyond the camp. Behind 
him a number of lesser priests were 
spaced in a semicircle. It was as 
though they formed a drawn bow, 
with the Corn King at the tip of the 
arrow. They were all quite motion- 
less, their masked faces bent upon 
the camp. Stark’s guide took good 
care not to pass in front of that 
silent bow-and-arrow. He led Stark 
off to one side. The deadly cold re- 
laxed its grip. 

Stark said again, “Gerrith.” 

The gray man turned toward the 
camp. Two figures came stumbling 
from the wagons. One, narrow and 
masked, supported another swath- 
ed in furs. When they came closer 
Stark saw a thick, swinging braid 
of hair and knew that the fur-clad 



figure had to be Gerrith. 

He exhaled a breath of relief that 
steamed in the icy air. Then he 
said, “Where are the others?” 

The gray man did not answer. 
Stark grasped him by one thin 
sinewy shoulder and shook him. 
“Where are the others?” 

The Corn King’s voice spoke be- 
hind him. The semicircle was 
broken, the work of the arrow 
done. 

“We have no need of them,” the 
Corn King said. '“The Sun wo- 
man — or wise woman, as some call 
her — I have use for. The others are 
worthless.” 

“Nevertheless,” said Stark quiet- 
ly, .“I will have them. Now. And 
safe. Also, we will need arms.” 
Hargoth hesitated, his eyes catch- 
ing a glint of starlight so the holes 
in his mask gleamed eerily. Then 
he shrugged and sent four of his 
people running back to the wagons. 

“It will do no harm,” he said, 
“though no good, either. Your 
friends will die later on, and le$s 
kindly, that is all.” 

Stark looked toward the camp, 
and the still figures on the ground. 
“What did you do to them?” 

“I sent the Holy Breath of the 
Goddess upon them.” He made a 
sign in the air. “My Lady Cold. She 
will give them sleep and everlasting 
peace.” 

The end of Amnir and his ener- 
getic greed. Stark found it difficult 
to feel much pity for him. The men- 
at-arms were doing a dangerous job 



66 



IF 




for their living but he felt little sym- 
pathy for them, either. His wrists 
and ankles bore the scars of their 
hospitality. 

Hargoth indicated a low ridge, a 
fold in the plain. “My folk have 
made camp beyond. There is fire. 
We have food and drink. Come.” 
Stark shook his head. “Not until 
I see our comrades.” 

They waited in the biting air un- 
til Halk and Breca and the brothers 
had been brought, together with 
weapons borrowed from the dead. 
Then all followed the Corn King to- 
ward the ridge. 

“There is food in those wagons,” 
said Halk. He walked crookedly, 
having been bound for many days. 
Some of the strength had gone out 
of him, yet he was as belligerent as 
ever, perhaps more so because he 
was conscious of his weakness. 
“Are you going to leave it for the 
beasts of this wilderness?” 

“We do not need it,” said Har- 
goth. “And we are not thieves. 
Whatever is in the wagons belongs 
to the Thyrans.” 

“Why not us?” 

“You were no part of their bar- 
gain with the trader.” 

Stark steadied Gerrith over a 
stretch of bare rock, then asked of 
Hargoth, “You said word had come 
to you from the high north. Who 
sent that word?” 

“The Wandsmen. They told us 
to watch for strangers coming from 
the south. They offered a high price 
for you.” 



“And you do not intend to take 
it?” 

“NO;” 

“Why not?” 

“There was other news from the 
high north. A man not of this world 
has been brought to the Citadel. 
The Harsenyi nomads saw him with 
the Wandsmen in the passes of the 
Bitter Mountains. The Wandsmen 
like to hide their secrets but the 
Harsenyi see everything. They range 
over half the world, and they carry 
news.” The Corn King glanced 
sidelong at Stark. “Besides, there is 
the Sight. I knew who you were 
when my people first saw you riding 
beside the wagons. You are not of 
this world. You come from the 
south, and it is said that there is a 
place in the south where starships 
land. The Harsenyi brought this 
word from Izvand.” 

“It is true,” said Stark. 

“Ah,” said Hargoth. “I saw it 
clearly during the Winter Dream- 
ing. The ships stand like bright 
towers beside the sea.” 

They had reached the crest of the 
ridge. Below, somewhat sheltered 
from the wind, fires burned. The 
humped shapes of skin tents were 
dusted with snow. 

Hargoth spoke solemnly. “That 
is why we shall not sell you to the 
Wandsmen. You will lead us to the 
ships, to the stars.” 

He bent his head humbly before 
Stark. But his eyes, looking up- 
ward, were not humble.

and they only seemed to lie! 



HAL CLEMENT 



othfer. In a long orbit it is easy to 
convince oneself that one’s ship is 
not about to fall onto anything, 
even though the sensation of 
weightlessness is that of endless 
falling. There simply is nothing 
visible nearby to hit. Of course, 
travelers have had nervous break- 
downs in spaceships too badly de- 
signed to let them see out. 

To a physicist or an experienced 
space pilot, a bounce ride is just 
another orbit. Unfortunately most 
of the orbit is underground, like 
that of a baseball — though, as with 
a baseball, the underground part is 
not what is used. Traveling by 
bounce from, say, Ley Base in 
Sommering Crater to Wilsonburg 
under Taruntius X, the trip takes 
only thirty-five minutes and is never 
much more than two hundred miles 
above the moon. But during the 
final third of it anybody can see 
that most definitely he is falling 
toward the ground. 

Rick Suspee had gladly shown 
off his adaptation to free fall during 
the long trip from Earth. He 
hoped, however, that no one was 
watching him now. In his mind he 
knew that the bounce-shuttle’s 
computer was keeping track of 
position and velocity through its 
radar eyes. That the computer 
would light the main engines at the 
proper instant. That a second com- 
puter with a separate power source 
and independent sensors would fire 
a solid-fuel safety brake if the first 
engine failed to ignite. That a 



living, highly competent pilot with 
his own sighting equipment and 
firing circuits could take over if 
both the automatics failed. Rick’s 
mind knew all that but the lower 
parts of his nervous system were not 
convinced. Traveling at thousands 
of feet a second on a downward 
slant low over the moon’s surface 
still made him tense. 

Annoyed and frightened as he 
was, Rick felt sorry for his step- 
mother as he glanced back and saw 
the expression on her face. She was 
petrified. He decided it would be 
best to talk, and luckily he had seen 
enough moon charts to be able to 
talk sense. 

“We’re past the peak now, I 
think. That’s Ariadaeus behind on 
the left, just into the* sunlight. You 
can relax for a while — we’re still 
more than two hundred miles up. 
Look for a white beacon flashing 
three times a second just to the 
south of our arc. That will be the 
Tranquility Base monument. We’re 
out over the Mare now. Look — on 
the horizon ahead you can see 
Crisium 2nd the mountains where 
Wilsonburg is.” 

The rocket swung slowly around 
so that its main engines pointed 
“forward.” The braking blast was 
about due. 

The mountains southwest of 
Mare Crisium were looming huge 
“ahead” and below. The Mare 
itself stretched beyond the horizon, 
which was much nearer than it had 
been a quarter-hour before. The 



70 



IF 




pilot’s calm voice sounded. 

“Thirty seconds to power. Check 
your safety straps and rest your 
heads in the pads.” The two 
passengers obeyed. The pad allow- 
ed Rick Suspee to see the stars be- 
yond the rocket’s bow, nothing 
else. 

The braking stage was made at 
two Earth gravities, the computer 
applying changes of one percent or 
so in power and a fraction of a de- 
gree in direction every tenth of a 
second throughout firing time — 
none of these adjustments could be 
sensed by human nerves. The only 
change at touchdown was from two 
Earth gravities to one lunar pull. 

“You may unstrap,” the pilot 
said, “but stay in your seats until 
we’re inside the lock. I’ll tell you 
when there’s air enough for you to 
exit.” 

Rick watched the mobile rack 
trundle the rocket toward the side 
of the sixty-foot circle of smooth 
rock on which it had settled. The 
circle was the bottom of a craterlet 
in one of the hills over Wilsonburg. 
The bottom had been leveled and 
the side next to the upward slope of 
the hill cut to a vertical wall. In this 
wall was the lock, now yawning 
open to gulp the shuttle. 

The craft was through the huge 
outer valve in moments. The black 
sky and sunlit rock outside were cut 
off from view as portals slid shut. 

The pilot spoke again. “You can 
start for the doors now. There’s a 
pound and a half of oxygen outside 



and it will be up to three before I 
get our own valves open. It’s been a 
pleasure to have you aboard.” 

Rick was on his feet before the 
speech was over. His stepmother 
was more careful. She did not 
exactly mind weighing only twenty- 
one pounds, but she was not yet 
used to it and the ceiling was low. 
She was about to make some 
remark about inadequate gravity, 
Rick was sure, when she was dis- 
tracted by what she saw outside. 

“Rick! Look! There’s Jim! He 
hasn’t changed a bit. I don’t see 
Edna, though — ” 

Rick picked out the man easily 
enough from the dozen figures at 
the foot of the ladder outside. He 
was the heaviest and obviously the 
oldest. Rick gave less thought to 
the whereabouts of his aunt. He 
was noticing that none of the group 
were wearing space suits. Yes, the 
air had to be all right outside. This 
realization was supported by a 
slight pop in his ears as the 
shuttle’s air pressure changed 
slightly. Evidently the pilot had 
opened both valves of the vehicle’s 
air-lock. Rick headed rapidly for 
the exit, leaving his stepmother to 
follow more cautiously. 



T he top of the ladder was forty- 
five feet from the floor of the big 
lock. Rick accomplished the dis- 
tance in a single jump — at least, he 
meant it for a jump. In terms of 
energy, this was about the same as 



MISTAKEN FOR GRANTED 



71 




an eight-foot drop on Earth; in 
time, it took rather more than four 
seconds. Which was enough to let 
Jim Talles step forward and catch 
him, the catch being embarrassing- 
ly necessary because the four 
seconds were also quite long 
enough to permit Rick to complete 
the best part of an unintended som- 
ersault. His moon coordination not 
as good as he had supposed — he 
had left the top step with more spin 
than he realized. His uncle’s first 
words were a tactful reproof. 

“Watch it, lad. Carelessness can 
be dangerous on the moon. I take it 
your mother is aboard?” 

“Sure is. I — I guess you’re my 
Uncle Jim. Uh — hello.” Rick could 
not decide whether he was more 
frightened or embarrassed. It had 
been a weird sensation on the way 
down, something like that of a 
diver leaving the board to do a jack- 
knife and deciding too late to turn 
it into a half-twist. That was bad 
enough — but still worse, Rick felt, 
was the fact that the five young 
persons accompanying his uncle 
were all about Ri<jk Suspee’s own 
age. None had laughed or even 
smiled, but he could imagine what 
they were thinking. For about the 
five-hundredth time since his fif- 
teenth birthday he told himself to 
stop showing off. Then he took a 
closer look at the five teen-agers. 

One, on second glance, appeared 
almost too old for that category. He 
was about Rick’s own height — five- 
and-a-half feet — but stouter, stur- 



dier. His broad shirtfront was cov- 
ered even more solidly than Rick’s 
own by competence badges, many 
of which the Earth boy could not 
recognize — naturally enough. 

A quick glance showed that all 
the others were similarly decorated. 
But Rick saw with relief that none 
exhibited nearly as much badge 
area as he did. Maybe they would 
be impressed enough by his Earth- 
gained skills to be able to forget, or 
at least discount, the slip he had 
just made. For one thing, none of 
them could possibly hold an under- 
water rating. Rick’s scuba badge 
had been earned so recently that he 
was still gloating over it. 

“Jim! It’s so wonderful to meet 
you at last!” His stepmother’s voice 
pulled Rick from his thoughts. She 
stood at the top of (he ladder, Jim 
Talles posting himself at the foot to 
cover possible accidents. An un- 
necessary precaution. Mrs. Sus- 
pee’s methods of showing off were 
more subtle than her son’s. She de- 
scended slowly and carefully, 
reaching the bottom quite safely. 
She embraced her brother-in-law 
with an enthusiasm Rick suspected 
was due to her relief that the 
bounce ride was over. Then she 
asked about Edna’s health and 
whereabouts, delivered messages 
from her husband and sundry 
friends, and finally allowed Talles 
to shepherd the party out of the 
lock chamber and make introduc- 
tions. 

“Edna couldn’t get off the job,”

IF 




Jim Talles said. “But she’ll be 
home by the time we get there. The 
kids here with me will be hosting 
Rick a lot” — Rick gulped; these 
would be just the ones he’d played 
the fool for — “and will probably 
show him a good deal more than I 
could. This is Aichi Yen, chairman 
by earned competence of the group 
known officially as the Fresh Foot- 
prints. Usually they call themselves 
by less formal names.” Talles indi- 
cated the oldest member, whose 
badges Rick had already particu- 
larly noticed. His face, to Rick, 
seemed rather nondescript. His 
hair, cut short in the common 
moon style so as to give no trouble 
inside a space helmet, was jet 
black. His eyes gave just a sugges- 
tion of the ancestry implied by his 
name although the color of his skin 
suggested suntan much more than 
Earth’s Orient. 

“This is Marie D’Nombu.” A 
girl certainly not yet sixteen nodded 
in greeting. She was several inches 
shorter than Rick and Aichi but her 
shirt was well covered with badges. 
Her lips were parted in a good- 
humored smile, and Rick wished he 
were sure she was not laughing at 
him. “Orm Hoffman — Peter Wil- 
lett — Audie Rice.” A tall, unbe- 
lievably thin boy of Rick’s own age, 
a fourteen-year-old with a shy ex- 
pression and skin almost as dark as 
Marie’s, and a girl about twenty 
pounds more massive than Marie 
acknowledged their names in turn. 
All were looking more at Rick’s 



shirt than at his face. 

“Rick will come with me for 
now,” Talles told the young people. 
“It was good of you to trouble to 
meet him here. I’ll be glad to see all 
of you at my place around ten p.m. 
and as long after as anyone can stay 
awake. I know you’re busily sched- 
uled now — so thanks again for 
coming.” 

Aichi Yen shook hands with 
Talles and, as an afterthought, 
with Rick, then nodded to Mrs. 
Suspee and disappeared into a 
nearby tunnel mouth. Three of the 
others did the same. Marie altered 
the pattern by speaking. 

“I’m glad to meet you, Rick. I’ve 
been looking forward to it ever 
since Chief Jim told us you were 
coming. I’ve read a lot about 
Earth. I’ve tried to imagine what 
it’s like to be able to go outdoors 
with no special preparation unless 
it’s raining or something like that. I 
hope you’ll tell us about wind and 
rainbows and glaciers and such — ” 
“I can try. I’ve never seen a 
glacier, though.” 

“Well, that makes us even. I’ve 
never seen a radical trap.” 

“What’s that?” 

“I’ll tell you tonight if the Chief 
hasn’t beaten me to it. I’m sup- 
posed to be in class now. ’Bye.” She 
was gone on the track of the others. 

“Those seem interesting young- 
sters,” Mrs. Suspee remarked as 
the girl disappeared. “I’m not sure 
I approve of that flaunting of 
badges, though. It seems like

showing off. I was hoping we’d be 
away from that sort of thing on the 
moon. We get enough of it at 
home.” 

“If the badges are properly 
earned, why not display ’em?” re- 
sponded her brother-in-law. 
“There are a lot worse things than 
letting the world know what you 
can do well.” 

“Well, Jim, I won’t argue. And 
you’ll notice I didn’t forbid Rick to 
wear his badges here, even if I did 
hope they’d turn out to be out of 
style.” She gazed off to her left. “I 
think those must be our bags over 
there. Do we take a cab, or do you 
live close by?” 

“Our place is about eight miles 
away.’’ Talles seemed amused. 
Smiling, he added, “We walk, and 
carry our baggage.” 

His sister-in-law looked at him, 
stupefied. Rick, too, was startled. 
The bags weren’t heavy, especially 
on the moon, but — 

“There’s no public transporta- 
tion here. We could probably work 
out some arrangement for getting 
-the luggage delivered, but it would 
inconvenience a lot of people.” 

“I hadn’t thought of that.” Mrs. 
Suspee frowned. “I suppose this is 
a sort of frontier town, in a way.” 
Talles laughed. “Maybe it is, but 
that’s not why we walk. You’re on 
the moon now. You weigh about a 
sixth of what you did on Earth. You 
need exercise, plenty of it, or your 
muscle tone goes down, your circu- 
lation falters, your bones start 



getting soft. A good rule of thumb 
is ten miles of fast walking every 
day for each hundred pounds of 
body mass. If your work doesn’t 
give you time for that, you get a 
doctor to prescribe some specific 
exercises and you do ’em faithfully. 
All right — traveling!” 



H e picked up his sister-in-law’s 
luggage — a forty-pound-mass 
bag in each hand — and started off 
down the same tunnel that had 
swallowed the Footprints members. 
Rick took his own much lighter 
load, and he and his stepmother 
followed his uncle. 

The tunnel ran about eight feet 
wide and ten feet high for some 
thirty yards. An airtight door about 
three yards in opened manually 
rather than by photocell or push- 
button. Talles carefully closed it 
behind them. A similar barrier 
graced the farther end of the 
passage. Once through this they 
found themselves in a much broad- 
er though not much higher pas- 
sageway. Well lighted, crowded 
with people, it was lined on both 
sides with large windows filled with 
sales displays. Except for the 
ceiling it gave the impression of a 
street in a shopping district. 

“Not so frontier after all,” re- 
marked Evelyn Suspee. 

“We don’t think so,’’ replied 
Talles. “But remember the freight 
charges back to Earth before you 
stock up on souvenirs.” 



74 



IF 




Mrs. Suspee was finding the hike 
less dull than she had expected. 
And less tiring than it would have 
been on her home planet. The trip 
was long, of course. In spite of the 
low gravity, one could not walk 
much faster than on Earth. When 
Rick tried, his feet spent too much 
time off the ground and left him 
with poor control or none; and after 
a near-collision with another pedes- 
trian, who glared first at him and 
then at his uncle, the boy was more 
careful. Talles advised him that 
there were pedestrian speed limits, 
quite strictly enforced, in the 
tunnels; if he wanted to try the 
leaping “run” cultivated by moon- 
dwellers, there were caves devoted 
to athletics. 

Part of the walk was through res- 
idential tunnels, not quite as wide 
as those in the business districts but 
interrupted more often by parklike 
caves where grass, flowers and even 
bushes grew under the artificial 
light. Rick noticed that each of the 
doors along these tunnels was 
marked by a small lamp; some 
white, the rest blue except for a 
very few that were red. He asked his 
uncle about them. 

“We work around the clock here, 
Rick. The periods of sunlight don’t 
match human biological rhythms, 
and few of us see the sun much any- 
way. It’s more efficient for facilities 
to be in use all the time rather than 
shut down sixteen hours a day while 
people play and sleep, so we live in 
shifts. White light over a door 



means the family is up for the day, 
though of course they may be out at 
work or school or what have you. 
Blue means they’re asleep. Red 
means the unit isn’t occupied. No 
matter when you walk the tunnels 
you’ll find about as many people in 
them as now. All but the smallest 
businesses are always open, and the 
mines, schools and other produc- 
tive facilities are always operating.” 
“I’d think if you overslept, you’d 
have a hard time finding out 
whether you were late for today’s 
work or early for tomorrow’s,” 
remarked Rick. “Looking out the 
window would tell you nothing. I 
suppose you use twenty-four hours 
clocks, though.” 

“You’ve touched a sore subject,” 
his uncle replied. “As a matter of 
fact, we don’t. We still have the 
a.m. and p.m. distinction. I know 
it’s silly, but every time the change 
is proposed in the settlement coun- 
cil it’s defeated. People just don't 
like the idea of going to work at 
half- past seventeen. Of course, the 
same thing holds true on Earth. 
And because they want to start 
work earlier in summer so they can 
have more recreation time before 
dark, they make laws changing the 
clock settings. I admit it doesn’t 
really matter whether you start your 
time measurement from local mean 
apparent midnight or any other 
moment — but changing the zero 
point back and forth with the sea- 
sons I insist is pretty silly. We’re 
just as human here, so I don’t

suppose we’ll ever gradpate to the 
twenty-four hour clock.” 

Rick’s aunt was at home when 
they arrived. She was a taller and 
quieter woman than Evelyn Suspee. 
At least she seemed quieter to Rick 
but that may have been because his 
stepmother did not give anyone else 
much chance to talk. She monopo- 
lized the conversation all through 
the standard guest- arrival routine 
of settling the visitors in their 
rooms and feeding them dinner. 

Rick would much rather have lis- 
tened to his aunt and uncle talk. 
After all, that was what he was here 
for, wasn’t it? To learn more about 
the moon and the people who 
dwelled on it? 

He bit thoughtfully into his cutlet 
of fish-meal artificially flavored 
and imported from Earth like prac- 
tically everything else eaten here. 
Three generations of colonization 
had seen the steady growth of youth 
organizations on the moon devoted 
to hiking, exploration, technical 
innovation and the like. Although 
autonomous, they were loosely 
joined into a confederation that set 
standards and established goals. 

The trend had inspired a resur- 
gence of similar youth clubs on 
Earth. There the emphasis was on 
ecology, space science and — where 
still available — outdoor living. The 
FEA — Federated Earth Adoles- 
cents — had agreed to send a repre- 
sentative to exchange ideas and 
knowledges with a typical lunar 
group. Largely because he had an 



uncle on the moon interested in the 
youth movement, Rick Suspee had 
been chosen as the emissary. His 
stepmother had elected to accom- 
pany him, at her own expense. She 
wanted to see her sister, Edna, 
after a separation of many years, 
and to meet her sister’s husband, 
Jim Talles. 

Rick earnestly hoped he would 
be up to the responsibilities wished 
on him by the FEA. He glanced 
across the table at his husky, curly- 
haired uncle by marriage. Rick felt 
sure that the man would help him. 
Talles was the kind of person who 
inspires confidence. He had no 
children of his own, and it was per- 
haps in compensation for that lack 
that he devoted himself to the 
affairs of young people. 



about an hour after dessert and 
coffee, the Footprints mem- 
bers began to arrive. Marie 
D’Nombu was first by perhaps five 
minutes, and within another half- 
hour ten of the group were crowded 
into the small Talles living cave. 
Since Aichi Yen was among them, 
Rick was still a little uneasy about 
speaking up. Marie quickly took 
care of that situation. Somehow she 
managed to take the conversation 
away from Mrs. Suspee without 
actually interrupting, then smooth- 
ly induced the Earth boy to talk. 

Jim Talles was wearing another 
of his amused smiles. He knew 
Marie and her brains. He listened 



76 



IF 




with approval as the girl pulled 
Rick into the chatter by making re- 
marks about Earth that simply had 
to be corrected — remarks not really 
silly but indicating reasonable mis- 
understandings. The question of 
going out in the rain, which she had 
left unsettled back at the lock, was 
straightened out, and incidentally 
gave Rick a much better idea of just 
what “outdoors” meant to these 
moon folks. They called it “out- 
side.” He himself described scuba 
wet-suits as opposed to space suits, 
and even Aichi made a slip in phy- 
sics there when he remarked that it 
must be harder to swim in Earth’s 
heavier gravity. Jim Talles wonder- 
ed whether this had been done on 
purpose to make Rick feel better 
about his mistake at the rocket 
ladder. If so, Marie must have in- 
spired it; Aichi would never have 
thought up such a thing by himself. 

Marie herself helped Aichi Yen 
out of his confusion by getting him 
to describe his present outdoor 
work, and this interested even Mrs. 
Suspee for a while. A physics stu- 
dent, Aichi had worked out what he 
hoped was an original computer 
technique for untangling meaning- 
ful radio signals from noise. He was 
going to give it a test in about a 
week, when there was to be an 
eclipse. He would be picking up 
signals from Earth and the sun 
simultaneously, a mixture of com- 
plex natural and even more com- 
plex artificial waves, and would 
then spend several happy weeks 

MISTAKEN FOR GRANTED 



with his records in the school com- 
puter lab. He had set up his receiv- 
ing equipment in a small crater 
quite some distance from town so 
as to avoid still a third set of inter- 
ference patterns. 

“We’ll get you out to Aichi’s site 
when the action starts, Rick,” 
Talles put in. “I suppose you’re in a 
hurry to get outside, but if you can 
wait a few days there’ll be more to 
see and something really to do. I 
don’t suppose you’ve ever seen an 
eclipse of the sun, and by waiting 
you can charge two batteries on one 
line. Besides, there are things I 
think you’ll want to see inside, like 
the mine where I work, and if will 
be handier for me if we take care of 
that first.” 

“And maybe he can come to the 
school with some of us,” said 
Marie. “There are a lot of people 
there who don’t know as much 
about Earth as they think they do. 
Rick can straighten them out. All 
right, Rick?” 

“Sure. I don’t mind the wait. 
How long a ride is it out to Aichi’s 
set-up?” 

Talles smiled. “It’s in Picard G, 
isn’t it, Aichi?” 

“Picard GA, to be exact.” 

“Yes. That’s about thirty miles, 
as I remember, but you don’t ride. 
The Footprints really meant it 
when they picked their name, even 
if it was two generations ago. You 
can walk that far, can’t you?” 

“Oh, sure. It’s just that I didn’t 
think I’d be allowed to hike 

77 




outside. I don’t have any experi- 
ence with space suits, and I figured 
there’d be all sorts of regulations 
about who could go out in them.” 

‘‘There are,” admitted his uncle. 
“You’ll be competent, though, 
before you go out. That’s my re- 
sponsibility,” he added hastily as 
he saw the worried look on the faces 
of two or three of his young guests. 
“I probably won’t be free to go, and 
you kids wil be expected to keep an 
eye on Rick just as you would on 
any newcomer short on experience. 
But I won’t let him go unless I’m 
convinced he has the basic lessons 
thoroughly learned. So relax.” 
Aichi Yen and the others did relax, 
visibly. They had known for some 
days that the guest from Earth 
would accompany them outside, 
but they had been quite uneasy over 
who would be held responsible if he 
managed to kill himself. Jim Talles 
had been letting them stew in that 
pan out of curiosity, to see whether 
they would try to duck the load. He 
was, after all, one of their teachers 
even if he didn’t belong to the 
school department — he was the of- 
ficial adult adviser of the formally 
incorporated youth union known as 
the First Footprints. 

“Great!” Rick enthused. “A 
badge for spacesuit competence 
will really mean something back on 
Earth. Which one is it?” For the 
first time he began examining in 
detail the pictorial and geometrical 
decorations of the others. 

‘‘There isn’t any for suits,” Aichi 



said quietly. “I don’t think there’s 
anyone on the moon who isn’t com- 
petent about them — at any rate, no 
one over five or six years old.” 

Marie took the edge off the 
remark. “I guess it’s sort of like 
umbrellas or raincoats on Earth,” 
she said. “Or maybe you can think 
of something that’s an even better 
example — maybe swimming. I sup- 
pose everyone can do that even if 
they don’t all have scuba ratings.” 

“That’s not quite right.” Rick 
followed the change of subject 
gratefully. “A lot of people can’t 
swim, and there are six different 
water competence levels before you 
get to scuba, and a lot of others in 
watercraft management — ” He 
held forth uninhibitedly until 
Marie exercised her tact once more. 

All in all, it was a good evening. 
These moon people seemed a pretty 
good bunch, Rick decided before 
he got to sleep. 

The next few days confirmed that 
opinion. Rick spent two of them at 
the Wilsonburg school, wherp class 
routine was altered to make him 
the center of attention. He spent a 
day with his uncle in the mine that 
was the main reason for Wilson- 
burg’s existence. He passed a solid 
twelve hours with Jim Talles be- 
coming familiar with space suits, 
until he could don one without 
hesitation or error, check it out 
properly, conduct emergency oper- 
ations at reflex speed, and explain 
how electrical accumulators and 
Daly oxygen cartridges worked. 



78 



IF 




Talles had planned a further 
program to keep Rick occupied up 
to the time of the hike to Aichi’s 
site. But like so many plans, this 
one ran into trouble. An accident 
occurred in the mine. 

Not a catastrophe. No one was 
killed. No one was even seriously 
endangered — except Rick. And he 
was nowhere near the place. 

His danger arose from the fact 
that his uncle went on full-time 
emergency duty, and the schedule 
in the Talles household collapsed. 
His aunt had to work as usual but 
Rick had never gotten her hours 
straight. His mother continued her 
irregular round of visits and shop- 
ping trips. His young friends had 
their own rather tight schedules to 
keep. So Rick was left pretty much 
on his own. 

As a result, he got his sleeping 
hours out of step with the planned 
starting time for the hike. And his 
mother, in one of her rare moments 
of firmness, insisted that if he 
didn’t get a good night’s rest before 
going, he wouldn’t go. She was 
unhappy about the trip anyway. 
The idea of her only child walking 
miles out on the moon’s surface 
with only a few layers of fabric 
between him and vacuum frighten- 
ed her even more than the bounce 
ride. 

Rick was perfectly willing to 
sleep, but could not. He was like a 
six-year-old on Christmas Eve, em- 
barrassed as he would have been to 
admit it. He went to bed, but had 



given up all hope of actually sleep- 
ing when he did doze off. When he 
woke up, of course, and looked at 
his watch, his first thought was to 
dig a hole in the ground and bury 
himself. 

He was to meet the group at 
North-Down Lock at eight. The 
watch said five minutes to eight. 
And the place was an hour’s walk 
away. 

II 

I n the hall outside his room Rick 
paused. There was no time to 
eat, he decided. The snack of a few 
hours before would have to last 
him. The group must be at the lock 
by now — maybe if he ran he would 
get there before they left. It might 
take a while to get the whole crowd 
into space suits. Running would 
have to be done carefully, he knew. 
It was dangerous in the tunnels 
under moon gravity — especially so 
for someone with his background — 
and there were stringent laws about 
when and under what circum- 
stances one could run within the 
settlement. 

His stepmother never understood 
why he didn’t call the lock. For 
years afterward she would irritate 
him by returning to the subject and 
trying to make him explain. His 
uncle, of course, understood so well 
that he never even bothered to ask 
during the investigation later on. In 
fact, Rick never even thought of the 
phone. Moving quietly and hoping 



MISTAKEN FOR GRANTED 



79 




that his aunt slept as soundly as his 
stepmother, he headed for the front 
door. For just an instant he was 
tempted to rouse his stepmother 
and ask why she had let him sleep 
so late; but that would have wasted 
time. He slipped into the corridor 
his moon friends called a street and 
hopped, leaped and skipped to- 
ward North-Down, awkwardly 
threading his way among the 
people. 

He was not stopped for speeding, 
though several times he was the tar- 
get of irritated frowns. 

He would probably have made 
the trip in less than half an hour 
had he not mistaken a turn and 
wasted more than ten minutes 
getting back to the proper route. It 
was eight forty-five when he reach- 
ed the recessed doorway that was 
one of the entrances to the North- 
Down lock area. 

Sensors responded to his arrival, 
triggering a flashing light — green, 
since there was safe pressure on the 
other side of the door. Rick, as he 
had been taught, flicked the “ac- 
knowledge reading’’ switch located 
high on the door frame. Then he 
activated the door switch itself. De- 
spite the need for power economy, 
doors on the moon that opened into 
areas even moderately likely to tap 
vacuum were motor-driven. The 
chamber Rick entered was not nor- 
mally exhausted; it was a sort of 
combined garage and locker- room. 
However, it did have a large direct 
exit to the surface for getting out 



unusually large pieces of equip- 
ment. When so used it became an 
air-lock chamber. 

On every moon-dweller’s mind 
there was always the possibility of 
leakage or outright valve failure in 
any outer room. Rick was aware of 
that threat, just as the schoolkids 
he had met a few days before had 
been aware of rain and cold on 
Earth. It was the Big Difference 
everyone was told about. But 
awareness was not the same thing 
as the reflective self- protection of a 
native. 

With the door secured behind 
him — by a strictly manual latch, 
activation of which shut off a warn- 
ing bell — he made his way to the 
main personnel exits. His fervent 
hope was that the group might still 
be there. 

The place was empty. Even the 
lock chamber, visible through the 
transparent wall, was unoccupied. 
The outer door was closed, and the 
red light on its frame backing the 
green one at the inner seal signaled 
that the chamber was carrying 
normal pressure. This implied that 
the lock had last been used by an 
inbound person or group, a possi- 
bility that did not occur to Rick. To 
him it was clear only that his 
friends had left without him. He 
did not blame them. He knew that 
much to be done on the trip was too 
tightly scheduled to allow delay. 
But he was bitterly disappointed. 

Just which mistake he made next 
is still being argued. The fact that 



80 



IF 




he, or more accurately his step- 
mother, had fallen out of step with 
the Wilsonburg clocks was minor. 
In truth, Rick was actually eleven- 
and-a-quarter hours early for his 
meeting rather than forty-five min- 
utes late. And for the worst 
mistake, still to come, it is hard to 
blame anyone but Rick alone. 
Pierre Montaux is blamed by 
many, including himself, for letting 
Rick get away with it, but . 



P ierre happened to be on duty 
at the locker-room when Rick 
arrived. Hearing footfalls, the boy 
glanced back over his shoulder and 
saw the middle-aged attendant. 
They had never met before. Rick 
had had his suit check at another 
lock, and Pierre had not been on 
duty the only time the boy had been 
to North-Down to learn the lay-out. 
“What are you doing here, lad?” 
“Sir, I seemed to have missed a 
group going out to Picard G. Could 
you tell me how long ago they left?” 
Montaux shook his head, at the 
same time making the negative 
hand-gesture habitual to people 
who spent much of their time in 
space suits. ‘Tve just come on — 
been here less than five minutes. I 
was a little late getting to work my- 
self.” For that, incidentally, no one 
ever criticized Montaux. He eyed 
the array of badges on Rick’s shirt, 
estimating his general competence 
level by the area they covered with- 
out actually reading any of them. 



After all, for anybody of Rick’s age 
to be unqualified was rare enough, 
and for anybody unqualified to try 
to go outside was unheard of. “How 
long ago would they have left?” 
Montaux asked. « 

“Only a few minutes. We were 
meeting here at eight.” 

“Then they can’t be far ahead. If 
your suit is ready you can catch 
them easily. I’ll do your tightness 
checks.” 



T o rick’s credit, he never tried 
to blame Pierre for the misad- 
venture on the strength of those re- 
marks. Some people would have 
claimed that without Pietre’s sug- 
gestions, it never would have oc- 
curred to the boy to go out. But 
exactly that had previously oc- 
curred to Rick, and he never denied 
it. Probably the one biggest mis- 
take, of course, was made when he 
walked silently to the numbered 
locker his uncle had told him would 
contain his suit, and pulled it out. 

He donned it quickly and cor- 
rectly under the attendant’s eye — 
and who, Jim Talles. asked the 
world later, would have foreseen 
that the earlier training session 
thus would turn out to be a 
mistake? 

If Rick had been slow or clumsy,

tured into vacuum . But there 
was nothing to warn Pierre. The

suit went on smoothly. It fitted cor- 
rectly. Rick attached helmet and 
gauntlets properly, did the proper 
things to seal them. He made the 
proper signals to request tightness 
check, said the right things over the 
radio for the communications 
check. He strode over to the inner 
lock door, deftly operated the 
cycling switch, and waited until the 
inner light flashed green before 
opening the portal. There was 
nothing to show that he had not 
done it all a score, even a hundred, 
times before. 

Montaux let him through, check- 
ed the manual seal on the inside 
after the door closed, and gestured 
a “proceed” through the transpar- 
ent wall. The outer door’s light was 
now green. Rick operated its 
plainly labeled opening switch, 
went through, closed it, and dis- 
appeared from the sight of Pierre 
Montaux. And, for many hours, 
from the sight of mankind. 

Rick felt uneasy, certainly. He 
knew that neither his mother nor 
his uncle would have approved. But 
it did not occur to him that the 
Footprints members might not 
approve either when he caught up 
with them; otherwise he might have 
turned back right then. It did not 
occur to him, either, that he was in 
any real danger. The crowd could 
not be far ahead, and the way 
would be plain enough. After all, 
he had spent hours with the maps 
in his uncle’s study. He could have 
drawn from memory one showing 



the way to Picard GA. 

He looked around to orient him- 
self. Wilsonburg lies mostly under 
the hills southeast of Taruntius X 
at about 51.3 degrees east and 7.6 
north on the standard lunar coordi- 
nate system. The nearest point of 
Mare Crisium is about fifty miles to 
the northeast. The North-Down 
lock opens on the broad but irregu- 
lar plain of Taruntius X; as the 
names imply, North-Middle and 
North-Up open higher on the slope 
bordering the same plain. From 
where he stood Rick could see 
about ten miles across the slightly 
rolling and heavily dimpled surface 
to the western hills, and even far- 
ther to the northwest and almost 
around to north, where the same 
mass of hills that contained Wilson- 
burg rose to block the view. His 
path, he knew, lay to the north past 
the foot of those hills to a valley 
that led to Picard-G and which 
should be visible, if map contours 
meant anything, from where he 
stood. 

Maybe it was, but so were several 
other notches and valleys. Choice 
would have to be made. He made 
the most obvious one, but first tried 
his communicator. 

“Marie! Aichi! Any of the Foot- 
prints! Are you in range? Can you 
hear me?” 

He waited only a few seconds. He 
had not really expected an answer. 
He would pick them up — or they 
would pick him up — when he got 
around the spur of the hills. 



82 



IF 




He looked about him once more 
for other direction criteria. The sun 
was too high in the west — about 
fifty degrees — to be a precise guide, 
he judged. The same was true of 
Earth, which was too close to the 
sun to be seen easily, anyway. The 
stars? He moved back into the sha- 
dow of the sheet-metal roof that 
kept direct sunlight from the 
“porch” of the lock and found that 
he could see the brighter ones. The 
Big Dipper looked just as it did 
from home, and the Pointers 
guided his eye downward and left- 
ward to Polaris just above the hori- 
zon — of course! He was much 
closer to the moon’s equator than 
Boston is to Earth’s. One of the 
notches in the far hills lay directly 
under the star, and Rick, after 
examining as well as he could the 
ground between himself and that 
distant valley, set out toward it. 



E velyn Suspee woke about 
nine-thirty with a feeling of 
guilt. She had meant to get Rick up 
in time for his trip. Finding that he 
had already gone, however, she put 
the matter out of mind. She did not 
mention his departure to Edna, 
who seemed too concerned about 
her husband’s absence at the mine, 
anyway, to worry about much else. 
As a result, no one missed Rick 
until he had been gone for eleven 
hours. 

The Footprints group arrived at 
North-Down about a quarter to 



eight. No one knew quite what to 
do about Rick’s failure to show up. 
By their own standards anyone who 
missed an appointment “inside” 
had only himself to blame — it was 
different, of course, outside. After 
discussion and some grumbling, it 
was decided that maybe Rick’s tar- 
diness was not his fault entirely, 
and that his home should be called 
to find out why he had skipped the 
expedition. Evelyn Suspee was in 
when the call arrived. 

It took her several seconds to 
grasp that Rick was unaccounted 
for since leaving the Talles home. 
The realization had the principal 
effects of a firecracker — much 
noise but little else. Emerging from 
the explosion of words, though, was 
Mrs. Suspee’s assumption that 
Rick was somewhere outside. 

Marie D’Nombu, on the other 
end of the circuit, had not thought 
of any such possibility. She did not 
think itja likely one now that it had 
been suggested. In any case she felt 
sure that calming Mrs. Suspee was 
more important at the moment 
than eliciting mere truth. 

“Wait, please,’’ Marie urged. 
Soothingly she continued, “Let’s 
say Rick did get here eleven or 
twelve hours early. Even so, I don’t 
see how he could possibly have been 
stupid enough to go outside by him- 
self. Besides, they wouldn’t have let 
him. He must have realized his 
error about the time — probably 
then he wandered off into town. 
Maybe he hiked oyer to the mine to 



MISTAKEN FOR GRANTED

see what sort of trouble Chief Jim 
was having. We’ll call him — Rick 
could still be at the mine. More 
likely he’s simply lost somewhere in 
town. They didn’t start building 
tunnels on a nice regular plan here 
until a few of the early lodes had 
been followed pretty far, and a 
stranger can get mixed up pretty 
easily, I’d think.” 

Marie’s words calmed Rick’s 
stepmother considerably. She had 
had trouble more than once herself 
finding her way back to the Talles 
unit from the shopping areas. 

At Marie’s request, Mrs. Suspee 
called her sister to the screen. Edna 
had overheard most of the conver- 
sation and understood the situa- 
tion. She assured Marie that Jim 
Talles was still at the mine and gave 
her his visiphone combination. The 
girl broke the connection and im- 
mediately called Talles. 

It took several minutes to reach 
him. He was far out in one of the 
work tunnels, available through 
portable relay equipment. This had 
voice connection only; he could not 
see who was calling and did not at 
first recognize Marie’s voice. 

The girl concisely reported the 
state of affairs. Talles’ first reaction 
was to worry more about Mrs. Sus- 
pee than his nephew. He agreed 
with Marie that the boy was prob- 
ably somewhere inside Wilsonburg 
and was grateful for her efforts to 
convince the woman of that. 

‘‘I think I can get away from here 
shortly,” he said. “Maybe in half 



an hour. Meanwhile, find out who 
was on duty at North-Down when 
Rick got there, and see if the kid 
said anything about where he was 
going when he learned he was early. 
Then call me back.” 

“Orm is checking with the lock 
watch right now,” Marie answered. 
“I should have word for you in a 
few minutes. Do you want me to 
call Mrs. Suspee again if I learn 
anything?” 

Talles thought for only a mo- 
ment. 

“Call her if you’re sure he’s in- 
side, not otherwise.” 

“I understand.” Marie broke 
connection and turned to the 
others. “Is Orm back?” 

“Here he comes,” Aichi said. 

“Orm, who was on when Rick 
got here?” 

“Don’t know yet,” Orm replied 
breathlessly. “Del Petvar is on duty 
now. He says he was here twelve 
hours ago, went off just after eight, 
and Rick hadn’t shown up by that 
time. Del was relieved by Pierre 
Montaux, but we can’t get hold of 
him. He went off duty four hours 
ago and still isn’t home. At least, 
he doesn’t answer the visiphone.” 

“He could be home and tpo 
sound asleep to have heard the 
call,” pointed out someone in the 
crowd. 

“That’s possible,” agreed Aichi. 
“Who knows where he lives? Is it 
far from here?” 

None of the group knew either 
answer but Petvar, whom they con- 



84 



IF 




suited, was able to supply the infor- 
mation. Montaux’ unit was about 
ten minutes’ walk away. Without 
further discussion Marie rushed 
off. 

Aichi cast a worried look after 
her and then another at the nearest 
clock. This Earth kid was holding 
things up badly. They should be 
well on the way out to Pic G by now 
if the work was to be accomplished. 

But he waited. Confirmation of 
Rick’s whereabouts was essential. 
There was just that chance, a slim 
one but still a chance, that the 
fellow was actually outside. If so, 
the problems would be such that 
everything else would just have to 
sit in vacuum for a while. 

Then it occurred to him that the 
group might as well suit up in any 
case. They would be going out soon 
if Rick Suspee were found inside — 
and certainly if he were reported 
outside. 

M arie was back before they 
had finished their tightness 
checks. Orm Hoffman, who had 
not yet donned his helmet, blurted, 
“Montaux was home?” 

She nodded grimly. 

“He got there just as I did. He’s 
been at a show. He told me Rick 
suited up around nine, thinking he 
was late instead of early. Montaux 
let him go outside to chase after us. 
Rick didn’t return during Mon- 
taux’ shift and we know Petvar 
hasn’t seen him. So Rick must still 
be outside.” 



“Wow!” 

Marie continued, “I called Jim 
Talles from Montaux’ place. The 
Chief is on his way. To save time 
he’s taking a crawler from NEM in- 
stead of walking. His orders are 
that we’re to get outside as quickly 
as we can. Aichi, you’re in charge 
until he gets here. We’re to send 
two of us along the trail to the 
north. As soon as they’re outside 
the trampled area, they’re to check 
for prints Rick may have left.” 

All had taken off their helmets to 
listen. Aichi nodded. 

“When the Chief arrives, you’re 
to take the crawler and two other 
people and follow the same route. 
Pick up the first two when you get 
to them, and set all four to search- 
ing along the narrow part of the 
valley between here and Pic G. 
Chief Jim says Rick knows the 
maps well, and the most likely 
thing is that he headed north in an 
effort to catch up with us. You can 
go all the way to your site at GA. 
After you get there do your own 
work until Jim calls either for you 
or the crawler. If none of you finds 
Rick along the road or at your site, 
we’ll have to set up a comprehen- 
sive search plan.” Marie shook her 
head. She was near tears. “That 
fool Rick! How could he be so 
idiotic?” 

“Simple. He’s an Earth guy,” 
said Aichi. “All right. Everyone 
into the lock, then, except you, 
Norm. You help Marie with her 
suit check, and the two of you 



MISTAKEN FOR GRANTED 



85 




follow outside as soon as possible.” 

Helmets were donned and check- 
ed. Aichi and his group let them- 
selves into the air lock. Marie 
quickly stuffed her pretty self into 
her suit. She and Norman Delvec- 
cio were outside well within badge- 
qualifying time but Aichi Yen had 
already dispatched the first pair of 
searchers. They were visible half a 
mile away, going fast, making for 
the spur of hills coming in from the 
right. They were still within the 
heavily trampled area around the 
lock where tracking was impos- 
sible. 

“If he’s been gone more than 
eleven hours,” Marie pointed out 
over her communicator, “he should 
be most of the way to Pic G. It’s 
hard to see how he could have 
gotten lost if he’s really familiar 
with the maps. I’ll bet you find him 
out at your set-up.” 

Yen made the left-hand gesture 
equivalent to a negative head- 
shake — faces were hard to see 
through helmets, especially with 
sun-filters in place. “Judging by 
Jim’s instructions, he thinks the 
same. But I wouldn’t bet on it,” his 
voice came back. “Up to the valley, 
and even through it, I wouldn’t 
worry. It’s a worn trail. Once out 
on G, though, tracks go every 
which way. Every set of footprints 
made since McDee found the first 
lode in those hills is still there. If 
that’s not enough to mix up Rick 
there are crawler tracks going in all 
directions. He might be able to hit 



GA, I suppose, since it’s about 
three miles across, but then what? 
There’s lots of stuff and tracks in 
that bowl besides mine. And has 
anyone told him about bubbles?” 
“They were mentioned the other 
night at Chief Jim’s place,” replied 
Marie. ‘‘I don’t know whether 
enough was said to give Rick much 
of a picture, though.” 

“Well, I just hope he has been 
going slowly. That would give us a 
chance to catch him before he’s 
through the valley. Hey . here 
comes a crawler down from NEM. 
Must be Jim. Who wants to ride 
with me? You, Marie?” 

The girl made the negative 
gesture. 

“I’ll stay here until we hear 
whether Rick has reached your site. 
If he hasn’t, we’ll have to make a 
wider sweep. I think maybe I can 
help more with that.” 

“Why?” 

“I can’t say. I just feel I could. 
I’m still betting he’s out near GA, 
at or near your machinery. But I 
want to be ready in case he isn’t.” 
“All right. Digger and Jem, you 
come with me in the crawler. We’ll 
pick up Anna and Kort on the way. 
The rest of you stand by for what- 
ever the Chief is planning.” 

A moment later the vehicle from 
the upper lock drew up beside 
them. Jim Talles’ space-suited 
figure emerged. Digger and Jem 
climbed into the vehicle’s cab, leav- 
ing its trailer empty for the time 
being. Aichi joined them after 



86 



IF 




reporting the situation to Talles. In 
a few seconds the vehicle was 
trundling out across Taruntius X. 
Talles and the others looked after it 
but only for a moment. 

“So much for that,” he said. 
“Now — I suppose you all agree that 
Rick probably struck out north to- 
ward Cyg G. Are there any guesses 
about what else he might have 
done? Or what he might be doing 
now?” 

Silence, while the young people 
looked thoughtfully at each other 
and the lunar landscape. It was 
Marie who finally spoke. 

“Surely that would depend on 
when he finally realized he had 
been early instead of late,” she said 
slowly. “He must have gone quite a 
way before the truth struck him, or 
he’d have been back long ago. He 
got started less than an hour after 
he thought we’d gone, so he 
couldn’t have figured us to be very 
far ahead. He must have expected 
to catch up fairly soon, if he 
hurried — ” 

“But we don’t know how fast he 
expects us to travel,” objected one 
of the others. “He was never out- 
side before, and he’ll find he can’t 
go as fast himself as he probably 
expected to. So he may have de- 
cided pretty quickly that he’d be a 
long time catching up. Maybe he 
still thinks he started out late, not 
early.” 

“That’s a point, Don,” Talles 
said. “We’re going to have trouble 
figuring just what he would do and 



think. He was telling me a couple of 
nights ago about how different 
things were at the school he 
visited — he meant in what people 
took for granted. We’re stuck the 
same way. We don’t know what will 
seem like common sense to him. 
We do know — or at least, I know; 
some of you may not be so sure 
right now — that he’s nobody’s fool 
in spite of this trick he’s just pulled. 
So if Aichi doesn’t find him some- 
where along the road to the instru- 
ment site, we’ll have to try to guess 
what a reasonably smart person 
with a completely different back- 
ground from ours would consider a 
sensible course.” 

“You should have a pretty good 
idea. You grew up on Earth,” re- 
marked Peter Willett. 

“So I did. I haven’t been there 
for twenty-two years, though. And 
the fact that I’m still alive here is 
pretty good evidence of how deep 
I’ve buried my Earth habits. Still, 
I’ll do my best. Just don’t you 
throttle your imaginations because 
you think I’m the only one with a 
chance to solve the problem.” 
“Don’t worry,” said Marie. 
“We’ll figure him out.” 

Jim Talles looked at her. “May- 
be,” he answered. 



T hirty miles, measured along a 
low orbit, from North-Down, 
Rick Suspee went through a rather 
similar review of the situation, 
though this probably happened 



MISTAKEN FOR GRANTED 



87 




some hours later. He had not yet 
caught on to his twelve-hour error. 
Nevertheless it was evident to him 
that something was seriously 
wrong. 

He had walked for what he 
guessed was the right distance 
across the relatively flat surface of 
Taruntius X. He had reached the 
valley he had marked from the 
lock — fortunately, he had not lost 
track of it during the walk. He had 
followed it slightly upward and 
then down again to another open, 
fairly level area. The way was ob- 
viously a well -traveled one, as he 
had expected. Indeed it was packed 
so firmly that it would no longer 
take footprints or even tread 
marks, though often enough one or 
the other led off to right or left. It 
all fitted the mental picture Rick 
had gained from his uncle’s maps 
and the conversations he had heard 
and joined, and he had no doubt 
that he was now on the southern 
edge of Picard G’s floor. 

However, he had seen nothing of 
the hikers or any other living 
person. He had heard not a whisper 
over his helmet communicator. He 
knew that radio on the moon was a 
line-of-sight proposition, and that 
the relay units on the hilltops 
around Wilsonburg were turned on 
only by special arrangement. If he 
had never got close enough to the 
hikers to have no chunks of moon- 
scape in the way, it was perfectly 
reasonable for him to have heard 
nothing. But he could not under- 



stand why he had failed to get that 
close. 

True, they might have been into 
the valley before he had emerged 
onto Taruntius X. Yet if so they 
had traveled much faster than he 
had supposed possible. 

Rick himself had found that he 
could not walk much faster than on 
Earth. With far less fatigue, yes. 
Here he weighed less than twenty- 
five pounds. But faster, no. He did 
not have the coordination necessary 
to take the sort of steps that would 
keep both feet off the ground at 
once for any distance. When he 
tried it, landing on either foot was a 
matter of luck. Leaving the ground 
with an angular momentum close 
enough to zero for the result to re- 
semble walking was still beyond his 
skill. Failing to land on at least one 
foot could be dangerous; helmets 
were strong but had their limits, 
and moon rocks are no softer than 
those of Earth. It would be a long 
time before he could acquire the 
“lunar lope” — that swift, leaping 
walk at which moon-dwellers were 
so adept. 

Yet even if the others had the 
skill he lacked and could “step” a 
distance limited only by their mus- 
cular strength rather than their co- 
ordination, it was hard to see how a 
lead of one hour or less could pos- 
sibly have put them ten miles 
ahead. 

It then occurred to him that they 
might have stuck to the hills 
around the east side of Taruntius 



88 



IF 




X, rather than cutting straight 
across its floor. Some of the badge 
tests that the hikers were going to 
take during the trip could easily 
have required this. 

If they had chosen the easterly 
course, that might account for the 
radio silence. They had been in a 
valley cutting them off from him. It 
also implied that he was ahead of 
them by now, since his path had 
been direct rather than circuitous. 
With this in mind, he settled 
himself down to wait. His position 
was a short distance from what he 
took to be the northeast end of the 
valley. 

He had intended to wait for two 
hours at most. But the sleep that 
had been eluding him so effectively 
for the last few “nights” caught up 
with Rick. He never knew how long 
he slept, since his watch was inside 
the space suit where he could not 
reach it and his oxygen-cartridge 
gauge meant little in terms of time 
without knowledge of his personal 
consumption rate. 

Well, he consoled himself, he 
had been out in the open where the 
others would have seen him if they 
had caught up. Evidently the 
around-the-hills hypothesis was 
wrong. They had been ahead of 
him all the time. They must 
certainly have reached Aichi’s place 
in Picard GA by now. 

GA, he knew, was about three 
miles across. It should be no more 
than three or four miles away. Pre- 
sumably the whole crowd was below 



its rim, sinc6 he was still hearing no 
response to his radio calls. 

Unfortunately, no such feature 
was visible, or at least recognizable, 
on the slightly rolling plain before 
him. This might mean little; dis- 
tances were hard to judge in the un- 
familiar lighting. If the rim of GA 
were high, it might be difficult to 
pick it out from the background 
hills — hills whose feet were below 
the near horizon but whose upper 
details stood out as clearly as the 
valley walls a scant mile behind 
him. If the rim were low or non- 
existent, finding it from a distance 
would be even harder. 

Just the same, his map memory 
told him that if he headed north- 
east ficom his present position for 
three or four miles he should reach 
the depression. And it was prob- 
ably too large to miss. 

He looked around carefully, 
matching the shapes of the sur- 
rounding hills with his memory, 
and incidentally modifying the 
latter more than he realized. In 
case he would have to retreat, he 
made particularly sure that he 
could recognize the mouth of the 
valley leading back to Taruntius X 
and Wilsonburg. That was sensible 
although, as it turned out, super- 
fluous. 

He set out sturdily, but there was 
no easy way to tell when he had 
walked four miles. His pace was 
probably not its Earth length, 
which he knew well, but he could 
not guess whether it was longer be- 



MISTAKEN FOR GRANTED 




cause of the lower gravity or shorter 
because of this space suit. Expend- 
ed effort — fatigue — of course 
meant nothing as a distance guide. 
Nor did the passage of time, since 
he could not reliably judge his 
speed. 

Eventually so much time passed 
that he decided he must have 
started in the wrong direction. GA 
could not possibly lie this far from 
the valley mouth. Once more he 
stopped and looked around, less 
sure of himself than ever. 

The gently rolling plain furnish- 
ed a large supply of low elevations, 
any one possibly the rim of GA. 
Some, as he already knew, were 
indeed crater rims, but none had 
proven anywhere near large enough 
to be his target. There seemed 
nothing to do but check every eleva- 
tion in sight — unless, he thought 
suddenly, it would be better to go 
back to the southern hills and get a 
higher viewpoint. A few hundred 
feet might be enough to let him 
spot the hole he wanted without 
difficulty. 

It was a good idea. He would try 
it. First, though, he would check 
one rather noticeable rise to his 
left — roughly north, though with- 
out shade he could no longer see 
the stars to be sure of that. He 
made his way over to it and without 
much effort reached the top. 

It was not a crater lip but a low 
dome, some forty feet high. It 
measured about a hundred and 
fifty yards from north to south, and 



half that in the other direction. 

There had been no footprints on 
the southern side that Rick had 
climbed. But near the top he en- 
countered a well-trampled area. To 
his surprise, a few yards ahead of 
him he saw a long, low, obviously 
artificial wall. 

He approached the structure 
curiously. It certainly was not an 
emergency oxygen cache — he knew 
what they looked like and how they 
were marked. The wall was only 
about two feet high and five wide, 
though it extended over a hundred 
feet from the top of the dome down 
its western side. Apparently the 
wall was made of cemented pebbles 
and the dome roof of glassy ma- 
terial covered by lunar soil. 

Piercing soil and roof, near the 
high end, there was a long scar with 
a few footprints around it. At the 
other end, downhill, stood a piece 
of equipment he recognized in- 
stantly. There was no need to read 
the cast-metal sign that lay beside 
it. He knew the story. 

Eighty years earlier, Ranger 
VIII — one of the first hard-landing 
lunar investigating robots — had 
plowed into the southern part of 
Mare Tranquillitatis at terminal- 
plus velocity. One of those freakish 
distributions of kinetic energy that 
sometimes occur in explosions and 
tornadoes had hurled an almost un- 
damaged lens element — barrel and 
glassware — five hundred miles at 
nearly orbital speed. The fragment 
had expended most of its energy in

cutting the groove on this hilltop, 
bounced once, and come to rest a 
little farther downhill. The wall 
surrounded track and relic, pro- 
tecting them from the only feature 
of the environment likely to prevent 
their lasting another million years — 
human beings. 

Rick was impressed not by the 
recalled story or even by the sight of 
a piece of history. What struck 
home was that the Ranger relic, he 
knew, was not in Picard G. Some- 
how, in spite of his care and what 
he thought was a reliable memory, 
he had managed to come a dozen 
miles or more too far west. 

For a moment he considered 
beating a retreat to town. But the 
notion never got a firm hold. 

After all, Picard G lay only a few 
miles to the east — much closer than 
Wilsonburg. The hills in the way 
did not look difficult, and nothing 
he remembered from the maps sug- 
gested that they should be. He 
would find the Footprints gang, 
and safety, much more quickly if he 
cut straight across to his original 
objective. Furthermore, he had 
spent much time memorizing the 
locations of oxygen caches in G 
against the need for them ever aris- 
ing. He was safe for a good many 
hours yet according to his cartridge 
gauge, but it would be nice to be 
close to a recharge should he 
require one. 

Without further thought he 
headed westward toward the low 
hills. 



J im talles had spent the time 
driving down from Northeast- 
Middle in thinking, since the road 
was both safe and familiar. He had 
come up with a plan of sorts. After 
Aichi Yen’s team had left and the 
short consultation with the others 
was over, Talles wasted no time 
standing around. 

“Back inside, all of you,” he 
ordered. “We have some map- 
figuring to do, and I’ll have to get 
the relay units between here and 
Pic G turned on. Then we won’t 
have to wait until Aichi gets back to 
hear his report.” 

“But Chief, you ordered us to 
suit up,” Norman objected. 

“I know, but I’ve changed plans. 
We’d better not waste our suit 
charges while waiting to hear from 
Aichi. We’ll occupy the time 
deciding where to look next if the 
others don’t find him.” 

No one argued further, and in a 
few minutes all were gathered 
inside. There were plenty of maps 
available at every lock. Talles laid 
out a set presenting a complete 
mosaic of the area. For nearly an 
hour discussion ensued about the 
possible places where someone with 
Rick’s background might be if he 
had wandered from the planned 
route. 

The trouble was that none could 
actually believe that anyone, under 
the circumstances would have been 
silly enough simply to go off 



MISTAKEN FOR GRANTED 



91 




somewhere on his own. If he had, 
there was no guessing what else he 
might do, since his criteria of ele- 
mentary common sense would have 
to be incomprehensible. They all 
realized that the term “outside” 
meant simply “outdoors” to an 
Earth person and so did not carry 
the same frightening implications 
as it would to someone brought up 
on the moon. But none could see 
why this difference should turn off 
one’s brain completely. All the seg- 
ments came to a dead end with 
some remark to the effect that 
“. If he was dumb enough to do 
that, he was dumb enough to do 
anything.” 

Jim Talles alone was reluctant to 
accept that notion, partly because 
he was sure his nephew was quite 
intelligent and partly because it im- 
plied the need for a complete, 
square-yard by square-yard search 
of the entire area around Wilson- 
burg. An impossible task to ac- 
complish before Rick’s oxygen 
would run out. 

Rick had started with about 
thirty-six hours of the stuff in his 
cartridge. Of course, he might run 
into an emergency cache. But 
sensible planning would have to be 
based on the assumption that he 
would not. More than twelve of 
those precious hours were gone. 
The area that could be searched 
thoroughly in the remaining 
twenty-four by all the people who 
could reasonably be put on the job 
represented a frighteningly small 



fraction of the sector in which he 
might possibly be. The main hope 
was still that one of Aichi’s search- 
ers would find the boy along the 
route to Picard GA. After the relay 
stations had been turned on, Talles 
spent more of his time at the lock 
communicator than at the maps. 

Aichi kept his crawler well out in 
the center of the valley and was in 
continuous touch once contact had 
been made. Some of the searchers 
on foot were occasionally shadowed 
from the relay antennas. They were 
trying to cover the valley sides far 
enough from the main “road” to 
spot individual footprints. Any set 
of these that could not be account- 
ed for somehow, especially those 
that left the main trail without any 
matching return set, had to be 
investigated further. 

It was a slow process. The hills 
around Wilsonburg had been well 
examined by prospectors during 
the last few decades. Many of their 
trails were known to the Footprints' 
group but there were many that 
had to be checked out in detail. 

Time passed slowly. Suspense in 
the lock grew unbearable. 



T hen suddenly Aichi reported. 

He had reached his instrument 
site. Rick was not there. And no 
clue to his whereabouts had been 
encountered en route. 

“All right,” Talles answered the 
relayed voice. “If he’s not there, he 
isn’t. As I remember GA, he’d have 



92 



IF 




to be deliberately hiding in one of 
the small pits not to be visible — 
there dren’t any bubbles at the 
place that I ever heard of.” 

“Nor I,’’ agreed Aichi Yen. 
‘‘That’s one reason they let me set 
up here. The school is pretty 
careful even with its full-rated 
seniors.” 

‘‘Right. Therefore we have to as- 
sume Rick never got there — or if he 
did, he left for some reason. I can’t 
offhand imagine a reason that 
wouldn’t have brought him straight 
back toward Wilsonburg. In that 
case, you would have met him on 
the way — ” 

“But we didn’t. So he never 
reached this place. Something must 
have delayed him on the way. It 
couldn’t have been suit troubles or 
we’d have found him along the 
road. Anyway, he knew enough to 
check his oxygen cartridge and 
heat-control pack before starting 
off — if he hadn’t, Pierre would 
have spotted him for a beginner 
and never let him out.” 

‘‘I agree, Aichi.” Talles thought 
a moment. “Anyway, until the foot- 
searchers finish their coverage, you 
stay there and. do what you can on 
your own project — you can accom- 
plish plenty alone, and the last pair 
you dropped off can help you when 
they work their way out to where 
you are. That’s Digger and Anna, 
isn’t it?” 

“Right. They’re quite a way 
back, though. I left them with a 
couple of miles of the valley to 



check before they got out onto Pic 
G. I figured I could see all that was 
necessary from the crawler, once I 
was out on the plain. It seemed best 
to have the others concentrate on 
places where Rick might have let 
his curiosity override his common 
sense.” 

“Good. I don’t see what more 
you could have done. We’ll leave 
you to your own work for now. I 
hope the others will rout out that 
young scamp without our having to 
bother you again.” 

“Thanks, sir. I’ll keep the re- 
ceiver on and make the standard 
checks with North-Down.” 

“All right. Out, here.’’ Jim 
frowned. “Digger? Kort? Are any 
of you foot searchers in relay 
contact?” 

Three were. Talles got them to 
report one at a time but the word 
was negative in every case. He had 
each describe as exactly as possible 
the sections searched. With the aid 
of the other group members he 
marked these off on the map. 

The result was discouraging on 
two grounds. First, because so 
much of the probable area had 
been covered — and second, be- 
cause so little of the possible area 
had been. The group looked at the 
shaded portions of the map in 
moody silence. Only a few remarks 
were exchanged as the minutes 
dragged by and negative after 
negative came in over the com- 
municators. With each report, 
someone shaded another small bit 



MISTAKEN FOR GRANTED 



93 




of the map. At last the valley’s 
entire length was penciled in. 
Digger and Anna had reached 
Picard G, and were heading on to- 
ward Aichi’s station at A. Kort and 
Jem had reached the middle of the 
valley, where the other pair started. 

Kort closed his final report with 
a question. 

“Should we go on out to GA with 
the others, or recheck what Anna 
and Dig have done here, or return 
to town? I’m starting to get worried 
about that kid. There just isn’t any 
way to get lost along this road, that 
I can see. So if he isn’t out at 
Aichi’s set-up, what could have 
happened to him? He didn’t strike 
me as a completely jammed valve, 
so I’m sure he’s not hiding from us 
as a joke. Is there any sort 
of-^-well — attack, or something, 
that can hit Earthers under low 
gravity? Could he possibly have 
gone off his head?” 

“I doubt it,” Talles replied. 
‘‘Earthers do sometimes panic 
because of the breathing restriction 
imposed by a space suit. Rick is 
used to underwater gear, though. 
That’s even worse, from the breath- 
ing angle. So a space suit shouldn’t 
bother him. Besides, even if he did 
panic he wouldn’t run off and hide 
in a hole, would he? Aloneness is 
the last thing he’d want.” 

“Sure, Chief,” Kort said doubt- 
fully. 

‘‘I think you’d better start 
back,” Talles told him. “Come as 
fast as you can until you reach the 



plain, then spread out as before 
and again check each side of the 
main trail for prints. I’ll send 
people out from this end to do the 
same. It doesn’t seem likely he’s on 
Tar X, but — wait, change that. 
Maybe he got the idea of climbing 
one of the hills there to get a better 
look around. Both of you follow 
east around the edge of Tar X, at 
the foot of the hills, and check for 
prints climbing* He was wearing 
Type IV boots, Pierre says. I know 
his suit size is 16-C-A. Any prints of 
that pattern and approximately 
matching that size, whether you 
think you remember them from 
before or not, report to me.” 

“Traveling,” Kort said. “But I 
wish we’d had that boot data 
earlier.” 

“Sorry. Pierre Montaux thought 
of it and visiphoned us a little while 
ago. Carry on, Kort. Digger and 
Anna, have you been reading us? If 
you’re not too far out on Pic G, how 
about doing the same thing? Rick 
might very well have been uncertain 
of direction when he got out of the 
valley. He could have decided to go 
uphill to try and sight GA.” 

Anna’s voice came back. “We’re 
a couple of miles out — nearly half- 
way from the valley to Aichi’s spot. 
But you may have something. It’s 
worth going back for. Look, Dig, if 
Rick decided to do something like 
that when he reached Pic G, there’s 
a hill he might have used. Let’s 
head for its foot, close to the valley 
side. That’s where Rick would have 



94 



IF 




reached it and started to climb.” 
“Sounds good,” Talles encour- 
aged. “Check in at the foot of the 
hill, and do your best to stay 
line-of-sight from the nearest relay 
antenna — you know where they 
are.” 

“Will do,” came Digger’s voice. 
“If you have to follow a trail out 
of range, try to arrange your own 
relay — one of you on trail, the other 
in sight of both the tracker and the 
antenna.” 

“Right, sir. Traveling.” 

Marie, like the others, had been 
paying close attention to the radio 
conversation. 

“Shouldn’t some of us go out 
there to Pic G to help Dig and 
Anna?” she asked. “As I remem- 
ber it, there are miles of hills along 
the south side. Rick might have 
climbed any one of them.” 

“That’s a thought, Marie. But by 
the time any more of you could hike 
out there, those two would have 
pretty well covered the ground, 
wouldn’t they?” 

“Not if there turned out to be a 
lot of Type IV, size 16-C-A tracks 
to follow. And for that matter, why 
should we hike out? Wouldn’t it be 
faster to take a crawler?.” 

“Can you drive one?” 

“Well — not legally.” 

“How about the rest of you?” 
Jim glanced over the group gather- 
ed around the map table. 

“Aichi took all the rated ones — 
Anna, Kort, Digger, and Jem — 
with him.” Marie added, “That 



wasn’t very bright. But you could 
drive some of us out. There are 
plenty of crawlers at this lock.” 
“Sure I could drive you. Except 
that it would be too hard to keep in 
touch with the other searchers 
while I was driving, especially, in 
the valley.” 

“You can get through it without 
necessarily losing touch with the 
relay net. It would take a lot of zig- 
zagging, that’s all.” 

“I know. But I can’t get through 
it without devoting most of my at- 
tention to driving.” 

“I could drive, or Orm. It would 
be legal as long as you were in the 
cab.” 

“You’re a stubborn little wench, 
Marie.” Talles sighed. “I suppose 
you do have a point about the 
southern side of Pic G.” 

T here was a flurry of dressing 
and helmet-tightening. The 
group flowed over to where the ve- 
hicles were parked. Jim Talles went 
through the formalities of signing 
one out. He, Marie, and two of the 
others entered the cab, and the rest 
got into the trailer. He stared at 
Marie thoughtfully for a moment, 
then motioned her to the driver’s 
seat. 

Under her handling the fuel bat- 
teries came up to voltage, the indi- 
vidual wheel-motors were tested, 
and the machine rolled gently to 
the nearest vehicle lock. Marie 
established connection with the 
passengers in back, received their 



MISTAKEN FOR GRANTED 



95 




assurance of complete suit checks. 
She repeated the procedure for 
those in the cab with her, made a 
final check of her own suit. Finally 
she signaled for the opening of the 
outer door. 

Moments later the crawler was 
rolling smoothly northward at forty 
miles an hour — slightly better than 
its fuel batteries could maintain. 
Marie was drawing from reserve 
charge as well. Talles disapproved 
but decided to say nothing. The 
storage cells could be recharged 
while the group was searching 
around Picard on foot. 

He turned his attention back to 
communication, fine-tuning the 
crawler’s radio to the relay system. 
A voice check confirmed that 
Aichi, the four searchers, and the 
dispatcher at North-Down were all 
able to hear him. 

Marie stopped the crawler, to his 
surprise, before any report came in 
from the foot-searchers. As he 
glanced at her, mystified, she 
pointed to the right. He gazed in 
that direction and gestured under- 
standing. 

Some ten miles north of North- 
Down lies a two-mile crater. It is 
not the only such depression on the 
floor of Taruntius X. But it is the 
sole depression even close to that 
size along the straight path from 
North-Down to Picard G. Marie 
knew that Aichi had not dropped 
his first search party until reaching 
the valley. So she was pretty sure 
that this crater had not been 



searched. She also considered it a 
likely place to tempt a newcomer to 
the moon into taking a close look. 
Jim Talles smiled in unspoken 
agreement. 

A two-mile circle has an area of 
more than three square miles, 
which can use up a great deal of 
search time. It was fortunate that a 
check of the circumference proved 
sufficient. No boots of Rick’s type 
had crossed the rim except two that 
were overlaid, as a few minutes’ 
follow-up showed, by later prints. 
Even so, half an hour was lost. 

Marie had remained at the radio 
while Talles and three others had 
gone out. As soon as they were in- 
side again, she started the crawler. 

“Digger and Anna reported. 
They can’t find anything at the hill 
she picked,” the girl said. “They’ve 
moved to the west and are still 
looking. But — but all the reason- 
able possibilities seem wrong! May- 
be we ought to try the unreason- 
able.” 

“Or the more reasonable,” Jim 
Talles said. 

The crawler passed no more 
likely-looking stopping places be- 
fore reaching the valley. There were 
a few bubbles along the way — lava 
pits whose thin glass ceilings some- 
times gave way under weight — but 
the known ones had all been 
checked by the searchers and no 
new holes had been noted. 

An hour and twenty minutes 
after leaving North-Down, Marie 
brought the crawler to a halt beside 



96 



IF 




two space-suited figures. Digger 
and Anna were waiting at the foot 
of the rise that marked the south- 
ern boundary of Picard G. That 
feature is irregular — but much less 
so than Taruntius X, and its south- 
ern side in particular is much less 
steep than usual for the inner slope 
of a lunar walled plain. It seemed 
doubtful that Rick could have lost 
himself here. The climbing was 
safe, hardly to be considered climb- 
ing at all. There were comparative- 
ly few places where radio contact 
would/ be a problem. 

Marie’s attitude had changed. 
She had begun to feel far less sure 
that Rick was somewhere along the 
line of march between Wilsonburg 
and Picard G. The enthusiasm that 
had caused her to pressure Talles 
into driving from town had pretty 
well evaporated. She did not want 
to hike along a planned path 
looking for footprints. She wanted 
to try the unreasonable — or the 
more reasonable, as Jim Talles had 
said. The two need not be incom- 
patible. Because what might ap- 
pear most reasonable to an Earther 
might seem least reasonable to a 
moon denizen. 

Somehow Marie felt she was 
coming to know what might have 
gone on in Rick Suspee’s mind 
after he had walked out of the lock 
at North-Down. She wished sfre 
could be alone to think. 

But she couldn’t be. Talles was 
already assigning search areas. 

“All right,” he said, “we’ll work 

MISTAKEN FOR GRANTED 



in pairs, as always. Digger and 
Anna, stay with the crawler. You’ve 
been afoot a long time, and prob- 
ably want to assist Aichi anyway. 
I’ll drive you to GA as soon as I 
drop the others.” 

“You need all the searchers you 
can get,” Anna objected. 

“You two are so weary you’ll be a 
handicap rather than a help. As for 
Aichi, I don’t want him to miss out 
on the chance of a lifetime.” 

Jim turned away. 

“We’ll take two miles for each 
pair,” he went on. ‘‘Norm and 
Peter, start here. Cover the low 
slopes for prints. Call in if you see 
anything likely, then check it out 
before going any farther. Dan and 
Don, the next section. Same or- 
ders, when we drop you off. Jennie 
and Cass the third section, Orm 
and Marie the last. After I reach 
GA, I’ll make one circuit of it. 
Unless I find something I’ll come 
right back to pick you up as you 
finish your sections. Questions?” 

IV 

F ifteen minutes later Marie 
watched the crawler roll away 
toward the northwest. Orm Hoff- 
man, at her side, had to call twice 
to get her attention. 

“Let’s get with it, Marie. What’s 
best, I think — you follow this con- 
tour while I parallel it uphill a 
couple of hundred feet. Then any- 
time one of us finds a possible the 
other checks at his level. That 

97 




would let us catch trails actually 
going up or down hill.” 

‘‘That seems all right.” Marie’s 
lack of enthusiasm was obvious 
even over the communicator. Orm 
Hoffman noticed and wondered. 
Jim in the receding crawler heard, 
and remembered Marie’s remark 
about the ‘‘unreasonable.” Neither 
Orm nor Jim commented. 

The girl realized, however, that 
she would have to diligently devote 
herself to the plan, futile though 
she now felt it to be. She and Orm 
started eastward as he had sug- 
gested. They went slowly, the boy 
examining the ground carefully and 
attentively, the girl’s eyes doing' 
their duty as she tried to concen- 
trate. 

But she kept remembering de- 
tails of the evening at the Talles’ 
home — the questions Rick had 
asked, the ones he had answered, 
the ideas he had volunteered under 
her careful manipulation. She felt 
more and more that she could put 
herself in the shoes of Rick Suspee. 

Yet the more certain she felt of 
that, the less could she understand 
his disappearance. It just did not 
fit. The time mistake was natural — 
people were always making it. 
Following a group he thought had 
gone ahead was foolish but per- 
fectly understandable. Marie would 
not have done so herself, to be sure, 
but her upbringing had been dif- 
ferent. Outside carried much the 
same implications to her as under- 
water did to him, she surmised. On 



the other hand outside to him was 
no more special than the term out- 
doors so offhandedly used by 
Earthers. He would know there was 
a certain amount of danger invol- 
ved in going through an air lock but 
he probably equated it with, say, 
the danger of crossing a street in an 
Earth city — a danger recognized 
and respected yet lived with and 
faced casually. Yes, she could 
understand his going out alone. 

What had happened then? Rick 
knew where the group was going, 
knew the area as well as maps could 
teach it. Although he had never 
seen it before, he should not have 
had the slightest difficulty in iden- 
tifying the well-packed trail from 
North-Down. There was no special 
risk along the route. The normal 
ones like bubbles would not have 
caused him to disappear — unless 
he had broken through a new one, 
and in that case the traces should 
have been obvious to the searchers. 
Even if his suit had failed and he 
was a fatality — Marie could grant 
the possibility, much as she hated 
to — his body should have been 
along the trail somewhere in plain 
sight. The disappearance made no 
sense. 

“Track here, Marie!’’ Orm’s 
voice scrubbed her thoughts. 

Guiltily she looked back; had she 
passed a set of prints without 
noticing? No. She could see her 
own extending backward at least 
two hundred yards — her own, no 
others. She looked ahead again, 



98 



IF 




glimpsed what had to be the track 
that had caught Orm’s eye. The 
line of prints, imbedded clearly in 
the moondust, intersected her 
path, heading uphill. The sole pat- 
tern, when she got close enough to 
see it clearly, she confirmed as 
Type IV. Maybe Rick had come 
this far out of the way after all. 

“Start following them up, Orm. 
I’ll backtrack for age traces.” Her 
tone was elated. The indifference of 
a few minutes before had vanished. 

“Traveling,” he answered. 
“They bear a little to the right of 
straight uphill, sort of toward that 
hump half a mile back.” 

She goosed her communicator. 
“Jim Talles! We have a track here 
that looks good. I’m making sure 
it’s new.” 

“Great!” came the voice from 
the crawler. “I’m just putting my 
passengers off at GA. I’ll go around 
as I planned, but keep me wired — I 
can cut back to you any time.” 
Talles added, “Orm, how does it 
look to you?” 

“Whoever this is wasn’t just wan- 
dering. The prints go in as near a 
straight line as the ground allows. 
There are some breaks on bare 
rocks but I’m having no trouble 
finding the trail again just by fol- 
lowing the original direction. Does 
it backtrack the same way, Marie?” 

“No. There’s a fairly sharp bend 
a little way out. He was going east, 
just as we were— and then he seems 
to have suddenly got the idea of 
going up. Unreasonable! A waste of 



energy and oxygen! This must be 
Rick — it’s got to be.” 

“You keep back checking,” said 
Jim Talles. “Rick isn’t wearing the 
only Type IV boots on the moon. 
He hasn’t the only 16-C-A suit. 
Also, I wouldn’t bet much money 
that no one else has climbed that 
hill in the last forty years.” 
“Traveling, sir.” 

T here was radio silence for five 
or six minutes. 

Then Orm spoke again. 

“I see a dip between me and the 
hilltop. The trail goes down into it. 
If I follow directly, I think I’ll lose 
the relays. Shall I go ahead, 
Jim — uh — Chief?” 

“Yes. I’m proceeding toward 
your position now. If we don’t hear 
from you before I arrive, I’ll go 
after you.” 

“Traveling,” Orm said. 

Marie had paused to listen. Now 
she looked back up the slope. She 
could still see her companion but as 
she watched, the fluorescent orange 
torso that marked a Wilsonburg 
space suit disappeared over the 
rise, followed by the green-and- 
yellow helmet. Colors were selected 
for contrast against likely lunar 
background, not esthetic values. 

The crawler, decorated in the 
same three colors, was visible a full 
two miles away. She glanced in its 
direction, saw that it was nose-on to 
her, and returned her attention to 
the footprints. 

She wondered why Rick had not 



MISTAKEN FOR GRANTED 



99 




gone farther out on the crater floor 
before turning eastward. He must 
have known that the closest part of 
GA lay a couple of miles from the 
southern foothills. Of course, his 
judgment of moon distances might 
be poor. There was no telling what 
someone with his background 
would use as a yardstick. His pace 
length would, she supposed, be 
shorter on Earth. And to help him 
on the moon there was none of that 
bluish overtone, increasing with the 
distance of background objects, 
that she had seen on pictures of 
Earthscapes. Perhaps he thought 
he had came farther north than had 
been the case. But if so, why had he 
trudged so much farther east than 
necessary? Marie was now seven 
miles from the end of the valley, 
actually about even with the eastern 
rim of GA. The tracks, if they 
continued in their present direc- 
tion, but have gone right past . 

Her theories grew more and more 
abstract as she plodded along. Her 
notions of what Rick must have 
been doing and thinking, and why, 
grew more and more complex and 
less and less solidly based on what 
she knew of the young Earther. 
Then suddenly she was jarred back 
to reality. 

Another pattern of footprints lay 
before her, coming on a slant from 
her left — from the valley end, that 
is. It represented the trail of several 
people and joined the one she was 
following, completely concealing it. 
She looked ahead to pick up her 



Type IV pattern where it emerged 
on the other side of the inter- 
ference, and discovered with a 
shock that it didn’t. 

The implications were obvious 
but she resisted them. Instead of 
calling Talles at once, she devoted 
several minutes to a careful exami- 
nation of the moonsoil and its im- 
pressions. When she finally made 
the call, discouragement was back 
in her voice at full strength. 

“Chief, sir— and Orm if you can 
hear me — cancel this one. We’re 
wrong again.’’ 

Talles smothered a tortured 
curse. 

“Explain!” 

“Our quarry came from the di- 
rection of the valley with a group of 
either eight or nine people. He left 
them at the place where I am now. 
He was actually with them, not a 
latecomer following the track of an 
earlier party. Some of his prints are 
under theirs and some on top. This 
trail certainly isn’t Rick’s.” 

“All right.” Talles had got hold 
of himself. Evenly he said, “Stay 
where you are, Marie, and I’ll pick 
you up. Then we’ll go after 
Orm — or can any of you others 
make radio contact with him? He’s 
out of touch with me.” 

For several seconds the commun- 
ication spectrum was crowded as 
everyone called Orm. No answer 
came. Apparently he was still in 
radio shadow. Talles spoke again 
after a brief wait. 

“Marie, I can’t see you and don’t 



100 



IF 




know just where you are. If you can 
see me, give me a flash.” 

The girl unclipped a pencil-sized 
tube from the waist of her suit, 
aimed it at the distant vehicle, 
pressed a switch. Bright as it was, 
the beam was, of course, invisible 
to her in the vacuum. She waved 
the tube gently in both planes. In a 
few seconds Jim spoke again. 

‘‘Good. I have you zeroed. Stand 
by — I’ll be there in two minutes.” 

He fulfilled the promise. Marie 
swung up into the cab as the vehicle 
pulled up beside her. He had been 
unable to think of anything consol- 
ing to say. She would have to live 
with the collapse of hope, the bitter 
letdown. He had been getting op- 
timistic himself about the trail that 
had petered out. Well, he told 
himself, nothing to do but keep 
trying. 

“Where is Orm? You’d better 
drive, Marie, and head us as close 
as you can to where you think he 
ought to be.” 

She slipped into the control seat 
he had vacated. “Let’s see — I came 
from over theTe, and he was 
going — yes, that way — ” She swung 
the vehicle smoothly and let it build 
up speed. 

“You’re sure?” Jim’s question 
was purely rhetorical. He did not 
expect more than a rhetorical an- 
swer. He certainly did not expect 
what he got. 

“Well — ” She gestured vaguely 
ahead, toward a hillock that would 
have seemed part of the more dis- 



tant backdrop of the south rim to 
an eye unfamiliar with lunar scen- 
ery. “That’s where we . Wait a 
minute!” To Marie’s credit, the 
crawler did not swerve as the idea 
struck her. “I’ve just thought of 
something. The ground right out- 
side North-Down is packed solid 
for hundreds of yards around. It 
hasn’t taken a new print since the 
Mark Twenty crawler came out. 
Right? We knew the direction to 
Pic G from experience but Rick 
knew it only from maps. So if there 
were no footprints or anything to 
guide him, how did he know which 
way to start walking?” 

That question, too, must have 
been rhetorical. Certainly the girl 
gave Jim Talles no time to answer 
it, if he had an answer available. 
She kept right on talking, thinking 
aloud. The man recognized the 
symptoms. Marie had fallen in love 
with an idea again. He tried to 
muster some defenses but it was 
difficult. The kid, as usual, was 
being reasonable as well as enthu- 
siastic. She was still chattering as 
they reached the hillock and started 
up. Talles managed to get in a few 
words now and then but they were 
vague ones like “. you still can’t 
be sure.” Such objections did not 
impress Marie. She was sure 
enough. He got in a few more words 
near the top of the hill. But by the 
time they were over it and back in 
touch with Orm Hoffman, Talles 
had pretty much decided to go 
along with her. 



MISTAKEN FOR GRANTED 



101 




The idea of breaking up an or- 
derly and organized search pattern 
on the chance that she was right 
seemed unsafe. If she were not 
right, the error could be fatal. 

On the other hand if she were 
right and he did not follow her 
lead, the result could be just as 
fatal. 

T he trail Orm had been pursu- 
ing swept on past the next 
hilltop and apparently over the 
crater’s south rim. They never did 
find out who had made it, or when, 
or why. Orm had the sense not to 
go beyond the second hill without 
making another radio check, so 
when they did reestablish contact 
with him he was already coming 
back. This saved time, which 
ballooned Marie’s already surging 
morale even more. 

Twenty-five minutes after the 
girl had her inspiration the crawler 
was approaching the valley mouth 
with eight of the Footprints group 
aboard. 

Jim Talles had been in touch 
with the team still at GA. Although 
they were in radio shadow by in- 
tent, one of them had come up to 
the rim to make a routine safety 
report. Jim had salved his con- 
science by telling them to stay and 
carry on with Aichi’s project but to 
be ready to resume the search in 
Picard G if the new idea collapsed. 
He also called the two searchers 
still in Taruntius X and told them 
to continue their hunt back to 



North-Down. Privately he decided 
that if this idea of Marie’s did not 
crystallize he would declare a full 
emergency and get more help. 

Evelyn Suspee, afterward, was to 
have great difficulty understanding 
Talles’ attitude. She had been con- 
vinced that Rick was somewhere in 
town and was not told about his 
misadventure until much later. 
After getting over the first shock, 
she reacted most to what she called 
the cold-bloodedness of Aichi and 
his friends. It was a long time be- 
fore she could admit that a civilized 
human being could have put any- 
thing at all ahead of an all-out 
search for her missing son. And a 
certain coolness toward her broth- 
er-in-law for allowing anything else 
persisted even longer. 

Talles’ insistence that there had 
not been a genuine emergency until 
the very end carried little weight 
with her. She was culturally condi- 
tioned to values and priorities dif- 
fering from those of moon-dwellers. 
Their experience-dictated credo was 
that anything resembling panic is 
to be avoided at all costs, frantic ef- 
forts are to be avoided even in the 
most trying circumstances, and 
work must go on if humanly pos- 
sible. Only imminent loss of life or 
limb could justify taking citizens 
from their labors by declaring an 
emergency. 

While Jim Talles fully recognized 
the threat to Rick’s life, neither Jim 
nor his young cohort considered the 
threat that immediate. If Rick’s 



102 



IF 




suit had failed, he could not be 
helped. If the suit were whole, he 
still should have oxygen enough to 
last a few hours. 

Talles took over the driving after 
the crawler reached the valley. He 
sent Marie back into the trailer 
with the others to do some map 
work. Half an hour took the 
crawler through the valley and into 
Taruntius X. Once out on the 
plain, however, Jim did not con- 
tinue toward Wilsonburg. He turn- 
ed to his right and followed the ir- 
regular north side of the area for 
some five miles. Then he turned 
right once more along another 
valley, one that led northwest to the 
Lick E mines. At that point the 
search party began to implement 
Marie’s plan. 

Instead of dropping them off in 
pairs, Talles had the entire group 
spread across the width of the 
valley and start toward Lick E. He 
eased the vehicle along in the cen- 
tral, heavily trodden path, keeping 
pace with the young hikers on 
either side. They were going slowly 
enough to make sure that they 
missed no print of a Style IV boot 
of the size appropriate for a 16-C-A 
space suit. 

Fortunately Rick was rather 
small for his age. Most adults took 
a considerably larger suit, which 
meant that boot patterns of his type 
and size were relatively rare. They 
could easily be noticed when going 
off the main road on solo pros- 
pecting expeditions. Two such sets 



were encountered during the first 
half-dozen miles. They were quickly 
identified as having been made by 
the members of the Footprints 
group themselves. 

The valley floor narrowed then 
for a distance of some miles. Since 
there was less width of ground to be 
inspected, the searchers made good 
speed. Then the valley opened out 
and they had to slow down even 
though they paid most attention to 
the right side. On the theory that 
Rick had gone this way by mistake, 
he would have assumed that he was 
entering Picard G at the valley 
mouth. Hence, he would presum- 
ably have turned right — toward 
where he would have expected GA 
to be. 

The widening of the valley al- 
lowed the “road” to spread, and 
many more individual footprints 
became distinguishable. This slow- 
ed things down even further. Jim 
Talles changed his technique, run- 
ning the crawler half a mile ahead 
and getting out to search himself 
until the group caught up, then 
repeating the process. 

Speed was down to about five 
miles an hour. Nearly two hours 
passed in this fashion. They were 
now well out of the valley and 
slowing down even more as they 
struggled to cover an ever-widening 
front — in fact, progress might 
better have been expressed in 
square miles per hour. Even 
Marie’s bubbling mixture of enthu- 
siasm and confidence was begin- 



MISTAKEN FOR GRANTED 



103 




nirig to go a little flat once more, 
sure as she still felt that Rick must 
have come this way. All of the 
searchers were bone-tired and hun- 
gry. Talles reached the decision 
that it would be best to break off, 
alert the authorities by radio, then 
drive the kids back to town. He 
opened his mouth to broadcast the 
call-in — and at that instant Peter 
Willett’s voice came crackling over 
the communicator. 

“Hey — here’s a track! Breaking 
right out of the packed lane! Take a 
look.” 

/\rm reached the place first, 
examined the evidence. Excit- 
edly he called, “Peter’s got some- 
thing. Wherever it crosses other 
prints, it’s on top. The right size 
and style — and it’s turning off to 
the east. We’ll have to chase this 
one.” 

“Marie, you and Orm follow it,” 
Talles ordered. “The rest of you get 
into the trailer and rest for a while. 
If this one peters out we’ll have to 
go back and call for an emergency 
rescue party. I know you all have 
plenty of oxygen, but you can’t do a 
good job indefinitely without food 
and rest. Get abpard. Orm and 
Marie, lead on.” 

T he two space-suited figures 
hustled along the line of Style 
IV footprints. Orm was still placid- 
ly doing a job. Marie, though, was 
once more effervescent. She had to 
be right, she told herself. 



This had to be Rick’s trail. 

It was. 

The searchers reached the spot 
where Rick had paused for the 
second time — they had missed the 
one where he had slept. After un- 
successfully trying to locate him 
visually from some high ground, 
they followed his abrupt turn from 
the edge of the plain toward the hill 
where the Ranger lens had landed. 
There were, as Rick had noticed, 
no other tracks there. So for the 
moment there was no way to be 
sure that this one was recent except 
for the back-trail evidence. At any 
rate, it was the most recent track in 
the vicinity to have left the main 
path to Lick E. 

They followed the prints up the 
hill to the Ranger relic. All of them 
knew where they were. All had seen 
the historical monument before, 
and while not completely indiffer- 
ent to it they were far more con- 
cerned with the trail. This, of 
course, vanished on the packed 
area near the wall. They piled out 
of the crawler and gathered around 
the spot where the prints disap- 
peared. 

“It shouldn’t be hard to find 
which way he went,” Peter said. 
“Just walking around the edge of 
the packed ground should do it.” 

Talles had his doubts. “Marie, 
you got us this far. Which way, do 
you think, would he have gone from 
here?” 

The girl’s expression could not 
be seen inside her helmet but there 



104 



IF 




was no trace of uncertainty in her 
voice. 

“With all that map study, Rick* 
certainly knows where this monu- 
ment is. He would have had two 
chokers of what to do next. So when 
he got here, he must have realized 
his mistake. The sensible one 
would have been to go back to 
North-Down the way he came.” 

“Which he didn’t,” Orm said 
acidly. 

“Correct — because what seems 
sensible to us may not seem sensi- 
ble to him,” Marie said. “The 
other thing he’d have thought of 
would be to cut over to Pic G 
straight across the hills. Look east, 
there. This landing scar would have 
given him the direction if he didn’t 
have it already. And that first ridge 
is only four or five miles away. He 
must be lost on those hills some- 
where. Look for his prints going 
east.” 

A straightforward enough sug- 
gestion, but a complication arose in 
carrying it out. Naone looks direct- 
ly at the sun from the moon any 
more than one does from Earth. 
The searchers had not noticed 
before, but the general illumination 
had been fading during the last 
hour. Everyone had known per- 
fectly well why Aichi Yen had set 
up his apparatus when he did; they 
had all heard him remark, as they 
had left Picard G, that the eclipse 
would be full in only a few hours 
more. Nevertheless the dwindling 
light took the group by surprise. 

MISTAKEN FOR GRANTED 



As they started eastward along 
the wall to carry out Marie’s sug- 
gestion, someone exclaimed that it 
was getting hard to see. Nine pairs 
of eyes lifted to look through the 
heavy filters on the top of as many 
face-plates as nine space-suited 
figures turned to face west. 

For Jim Talks one glance was 
enough. 

“Quick!” he roared. “Orm and 
Marie, carry on. Check your tem- 
perature controls. Call back if the 
prints are there. I don’t want any- 
one outside but you two. The rest of 
you get back into the trailer. We’ll 
have to carry on with the crawler’s 
lights, if we can do so at all. The 
ground ahead is strange to most of 
you, and we could lose track of 
someone who went outside the 
sweep of the lights ...” 

T IAlles was obeyed without 
question. As he climbed into 
the cab, Marie’s voice reached him. 
“They’re here! Come on!” 

The remaining sliver of sun was 
narrowed rapidly now, the scarlet 
ring of Earth’s sunlit atmosphere 
providing more and more of the 
total illumination. Jim switched on 
the main driving lights before he 
started the motors, and suddenly 
the ruby-lit landscape outside the 
illuminated swath was hard to see. 
He swung the vehicle toward the 
east. The lights picked out the two 
figures a few yards from the end of 
the wall. One was standing, beck- 
oning to them. The smaller was al- 

105 




ready picking its way along the re- 
located trail. Talles thought of 
having the two come back into the 
cab and do the tracking from its 
vantage, but he dismissed the idea. 
Not all the moon’s surface takes 
footprints. Breaks in the trail could 
be handled more surely, and even 
more quickly, by trackers on foot. 
It was even possible, especially if 
Rick had changed his direction at a 
bad spot, that the whole party 
would have to fan out once more to 
recover the trail. 

Before they were half a mile from 
the Ranger relic, all sunlight was 
gone. The landscape beyond the 
headlights was just barely visible, 
lit by the circle of crimson fire that 
marked Earth’s position halfway 
down the western sky. The awed 
youngsters in the trailer were silent. 
Jim, facing east and driving, had 
little chance to look at the magnifi- 
cent display. 

The search party crept on, across 
four miles of gently rolling plain, 
around occasional craterlets, to- 
ward the ridges separating, them 
from Picard G and the valley route 
Rick should have taken. Even 
Talles, by now, had lost his doubt. 
He was convinced this was Rick’s 
trail they were following. 

As they reached the hills and the 
slopes grew steeper, new troubles 
developed. The comparatively loose 
material that took footprints so well 
began to give way to bare rock. The 
breaks in the trail that Talles had 
foreseen became more and more 



numerous. The searchers had to 
take to their feet once more, head- 
lights supplemented by individual 
flashlights. Sometimes the track 
would be recovered two minutes 
after a break, sometimes not for 
ten; but the author of the footprints 
had evidently been determined to 
keep going east. This conviction al- 
ways, in the end, let the hunters 
find the prints again. 

By the time they reached the top 
of the first ridge, the eclipse was 
nearly over. The bottom of the 
crimson circle was showing the as- 
tonishing “ruby ring” phenome- 
non. It was a beautiful sight. Yet 
Marie did not so much as glance 
back at it. Well ahead of the- 
others, she reached the top of the 
ridge. For just a moment she stood 
looking down and ahead, into 
another valley. It led back to her 
right, to the Wilsonburg-Picard G 
road. Beyond other ridges she 
could glimpse Picard G itself. Ta- 
runtius X was still out of sight 
around the shoulder of the hill to 
her right. Poor as the seeing still 
was, it was good enough to remind 
Marie that getting the first ridge 
out of the way meant more area in 
line-of-sight, therefore in commun- 
icator reach. On impulse she cried 
out: 

“Rick! Can you hear us?” 

The others, still below the crest, 
heard her call. They did not dare 
speak themselves for fear of drown- 
ing out any answer Marie might be 
getting. They simply hurried as fast 



106 



IF 




as they could to catch up with her. 
The girl, therefore, was the only 
one to hear all of the answer. 

“Marie! Where have you been? 
Down in GA? I’ve been calling off 
and on ever since I could see Pic G, 
but no one has answered.” 

Her laugh was like a sob. Tears 
of relief streamed down her cheeks. 

“Oh, Rick! We’re behind you. 
We followed you from the Ranger 
relic. We’re just at the ridge from 
where we can see over to Pic G. 
How far ahead of it are you?” 

“Well, I don’t know exactly. I 
reached that ridge maybe half an 
hour before the eclipse started.” It 
must have been longer than that, 
Marie thought. Otherwise he would 
have heard our radio talk when we 
first came out of the valley. Rick 
was saying, “I kept on as well as I 
could toward Picard, but you can’t 
hold to a straight line among these 
hills even when you can see. With 
the sunlight gone it was even 
harder. I’ve gone pretty straight 
though, I think, and have crossed a 
couple more ridges, so I should be 
between you and Pic G about — oh, 
maybe halfway there.” 

Jim Talles was on the crest by 
now, like all the others, and heard 
the last few sentences. Happy now, 
his tensions wonderfully eased, he 
took over the conversation. 

“All right, Rick, the safest thing 
now is for you to hold up. Don’t try 
to find the rest of the way to Pic G. 
It’s a wonder you got as far as you 
have— I can’t imagine whether it’s 



luck that’s kept you out of a 
bubble, or what. I wish I knew how 
you managed to duck them in the 
dark. But you stay right where you 
are. Even when full light comes 
back, just stand by until we reach 
you. You understand?” 

But this time there was no 
answer. 

V 

T ialles followed his own advice. 

He made the group stay where it 
was until sunlight returned. Then, 
with everyone riding, he struck out 
eastward toward Picard G. The 
footprints were now few and far 
between; this side of the ridge had 
little soft soil even in the hollows. It 
was not, for now, a matter of 
following a trail but of interpreting 
a report, filling in its broad gaps 
with guesses at what Rick would 
have done in a particular situation. 
Jim had developed a healthy re- 
spect for Marie’s judgment on this 
point since she had been proven 
right in her major theory; his re- 
spect was shared by all the others. 
Where there was disagreement, 
Marie’s word carried the weight. 

A couple of ridges. Did that also 
mean “two” to Earthers? Marie 
thought so, and they acted accord- 
ingly. 

Straight toward Pic G. But the 
visible part of Picard G filled thirty 
degrees of horizon. Which point 
would Rick have decided was 
nearest? 



MISTAKEN FOR GRANTED 



107 




Halfway. On what basis? What 
would have looked like halfway 
from the ridge? What seemed like 
half the necessary walking to Rick 
after groping around in near-dark- 
ness for more than two hours? Even 
Marie felt unsure about that one. 

They finally stopped at what they 
guessed might have been the place 
from which they had heard Rick’s 
voice. They were grimly aware that 
they were only guessing. The 
ground was rocky, did not readily 
show prints. They parked the 
crawler and spread out. 

Even in sunlight, many parts of 
the moon are hard to search effec- 
tively. This was certainly one of 
them. Moon shadows are intensely 
dark, since scattered light from the 
landscape does little to make up for 
scattered light from the sky. A dark 
patch may prove to be the foot- wide 
opening of a bubble deep enough to 
contain a person — or a three-inch- 
deep crater if the lighting is low 
enough. It is seldom possible to be 
sure of anything from a distance 
and, even for moon dwellers, 
distance itself is hard to judge. 

There was one easy way to hunt, 
though. Searchers could go to the 
top of each hill in the neighborhood 
and call Rick on the communica- 
tors. This was soon done — the only 
trouble being that it did not work. 
Either he was far enough away to 
be in radio shadow from all the 
places tried, or he was trapped in 
some local bit of radio shadow such 
as a bubble. It was the latter like- 



lihood that made detailed search- 
ing necessary. 

With nine people it does not take 
long to closely examine, say, a foot- 
ball field. However, a very large 
number of football fields can be 
fitted into a single square mile — 
many more football fields than 
there could possibly be half-hours 
left by now in Rick’s oxygen cart- 
ridge. None of the searchers, other 
than Jim, had even seen a football 
field but they all had equally valid 
mental similes for the job facing 
them — and the time left to do it in. 
By reasonable criteria, Rick had 
about eleven hours of oxygen left. 
That estimate might not be too 
accurate, of course; they had no 
data on his basic consumption rate. 
There might be one or even two 
hours more; there might, if he had 
been particularly active, be consid- 
erably less. Nobody spent much 
time thinking about the latter pos- 
sibility but all did force their weary 
selves to move as rapidly as pos- 
sible . 

One hour’s work. Six fissures, 
about forty dark patches to make 
sure of, two bubbles — empty. Move 
the crawler. 

A second hour. Two fissures, one 
bubble, twelve patches. 

A third hour. No fissures, a 
dozen loose rocks at the foot of a 
slope, with no way of telling how 
long they had been there. Two 
bubbles near the top of the same 
slope. Eight hours left, more or 
less — emergency? Talles drove to a 



108 



IF 




hilltop to request help from town, 
the request going via the Picard G 
relay network. 

A fourth hour, with fewer work- 
ers. Talles flatly ordered three of 
the searchers to rest in the trailer. 
They were dangerously close to 
utter exhaustion. 

A fifth hour. 

A sixth. Talles could not see 
Marie’s face clearly, or he would 
have tried to order her to rest also 
in spite of his knowledge that she 
would refuse. Moon-dweller or not, 
he himself was getting panicky at 
this point. Somehow the air in his 
own suit felt stale and oppressive, 
not quite up to keeping him going. 

The remaining searchers were 
reaching their absolute limit. They 
had had neither food nor sleep for a 
good eighteen hours. Yet they in- 
sisted on carrying on, even after 
two dozen fresh searchers arrived 
from the town. 

That was another thing Rick’s 
stepmother could never under- 
stand: why so few were sent out in 
answer to the emergency call. She 
could not grasp the fact that most 
of the jobs in a moon settlement are 
essential to its survival and the sur- 
vival of everyone in it. There is 
some leeway, to be sure. People 
need recreation as much on the 
moon as on Earth, and even moon- 
dwellers get ill at times. Still, with a 
small population completely depen- 
dent on a high-level technology, it 
is not possible to spare many indi- 
viduals at one time for an unsched- 



uled activity of unpredictable dura- 
tion. 

The additional searchers who did 
arrive had no more success than the 
Footprints crew. 

“He just can’t be in this area!” 
Marie said at last. “My guess is 
that we lost contact because he 
started back to meet us before you 
finished talking. He must have 
been right on the edge of a radio 
shadow. Chief — everybody— these 
new people won’t find him. You 
know they can’t. It’s up to us. We 
understand him. We figured out 
what he did, and got this close to 
him. We’re the only ones who can 
get close to him again.” 

“You could be right,” Talles ad- 
mitted. He was as weary and dis- 
couraged as any of the young- 
sters — and as determined to keep 
searching. “Marie, you calculated 
where we should look for him — led 
us into radio contact. Can you do it 
again? Can you tell what Rick did 
after that one message? And what 
happened to prevent his answering 
me a few seconds later?” 

“I’ve been trying,” she said im- 
patiently. “I’ve told you what I 
think. He must have started back 
toward us the second I told him we 
were behind him. His course took 
him downward, obviously, into 
radio shadow. We’ve passed places 
where he could have been that 
would have cut him off the moment 
he started downhill.” 

“Why didn’t he go back up when 
he found himself in shadow?” 



MISTAKEN FOR GRANTED 



109 




“Because he didn’t know you 
had more to say. You told him not 
to go on — you didn’t say until the 
end of your message that he was to 
stay put. I’m betting he didn’t hear 
that. Actually I could see four hill- 
tops from where we were then 
which were just barely sticking over 
nearer ridges. He could have been 
on any one of them. We’ve covered 
the area of two since then, includ- 
ing the one I still think was most 
likely.” 

‘‘Have you figured out why he 
didn’t meet us, if he was coming 
back for that purpose?” 

‘‘He could have stepped into a 
collapsed bubble, which I don’t 
think he’d do — or he could have 
broken through a new one. We 
haven’t found him in any bubble 
hole, though. Possibly he simply 
got led off by the ground. Person- 
ally, I think it would be best just to 
backtrack to those hilltops, par- 
ticularly to the one where I think he 
was, and see where he would be 
most likely to go at each choice.” 

T ialles nodded, remembered 
that his helmet was not follow- 
ing his head motion, and made the 
affirmative hand gesture. 

“Right. Or at least reasonable,” 
he agreed. “Just the same, it seems 
pretty likely that he’s had some sort 
of accident. Otherwise, the chances 
are, he’d have come within radio 
range of someone hours ago. If the 
accident occurred at the beginning, 
just as he started back toward us — 



well, he should still be somewhere 
around here. It seems to me we 
should keep at what we’re doing 
right now — search this area. It’s 
the best chance.” 

“Maybe,” returned Marie. “But 
it would make sense for at least one 
person to follow back and try my 
idea. I’d be willing to go by my- 
self — ” She fell silent. She knew the 
dangers of traveling alone on moon 
territory. She was putting Jim 
Talles in a completely impossible 
position. 

But Talles didn’t consider it im- 
possible. He didn’t even stop to 
think. “Take the crawler,” he said. 

Marie stood motionless for per- 
haps a second, a startled expression 
behind her face plate. Then she 
whirled and leaped toward the 
vehicle. 

“Just don’t turn your brains off,” 
he added as she swung into the cab. 
Then the machine was rolling 
smoothly away behind its shadow 
toward the hilltop where they had 
started searching. It stayed in sight 
for several minutes, finally van- 
ished over a ridge. 

A sensibly calculated risk, Talles 
told himself. Even if did have to 
worry now about two kids instead 
of one. 

A seventh hour. 

An eighth and ninth. Another 
small group of helpers arrived, with 
the cheerful news that they had 
seen nothing of either Marie or the 
crawler, much less of Rick. The 
news was cheerful only because

Talles was able to convince himself 
that it meant the girl must have 
found a reasonable branch-off 
point on the backtrail. The orderly 
search went on. 

Peter Willett caught the first 
glimpse of the returning crawler. 
He was so nearly asleep that it took 
him several seconds to digest what 
his eyes were trying to tell him. The 
reaction of Jim Talles to Peter’s call 
was almost as slow. Jim had 
managed to make the young people 
take some sort of rest in brief shifts 
but had had none himself. He 
watched the slowly approaching 
machine for perhaps half a minute 
before finding his voice. 

“Marie! Have you found him? Is 
he all right?” Then, as he took in 
the astonishingly slow speed at 
which the machine was approach- 
ing, he croaked, “What’s wrong?” 

“Sorry, Uncle Jim,” came Rick’s 
voice. “Marie is asleep. She told me 
which way to go and explained the 
crawler’s controls, then just could 
not stay awake. Say, I’m not very 
good at driving this thing. Maybe 
I’d better stop here and let you 
come and take over.” 

F our hours later, at North- 
Down, Marie was awake 
enough to make light of the matter. 

“Once you understand how a 
fellow thinks, it’s easy enough to 
guess what he’ll do. The only really 
difficult choice after I took the 
crawler was my first one, between a 
fairly wide and level gully that led 



Why Do 

You Have 
A Poor 



Memory? 



A noted publisher in Chicago re- 
ports there is a simple technique 
for acquiring a powerful memory 
which can pay you real dividends 
in both business and social ad- 
vancement and works like magic 
to give you added poise, neces- 
sary self-confidence and greater 
popularity. 

According to this publisher, 
many people do not realize how 
much they could influence others 
simply by remembering accu- 
rately everything they see, hear, 
or read. Whether in business, at 
social functions or even in casual 
conversations with new acquaint- 
ances, there are ways in which 
you can dominate each situation 
by your ability to remember. 

To acquaint the readers of this 
publication with the easy-to- 
follow rules for developing skill 
in remembering anything you 
choose to remember, the pub- 
lishers have printed full details 
of their self-training method in a

MISTAKEN FOR GRANTED

southwest and a narrow one that 
went more nearly west, the way 
Rick would want to go. I didn’t 
think the narrow one would go 
through, so I picked the other. I 
still don’t know whether Rick 
wasted any time on the dead end. 
At the next guessing point I had a 
footprint to help, but it was wrong. 
Rick must have started one way 
and then changed his mind. An- 
other blind alley. After that it was 
easy, until I came to a fault where 
you could see the sun coming 
through — it had to be a clear path 
west. Part way through it there’s a 
thirty-foot downstep in loose soil, 
and I could see where the edge had 
broken away — ” 

“Bixby’s Grave,” remarked one 
of her adult listeners. ‘‘How did he 
get that far off course?” 

‘‘That whole area is mostly fault 
cracks,” pointed out Marie. “Most 
of the time the sun can’t be seen, 
and sunlight on rocks overhead can 
be very tricky. Anyway, Rick had 
left prints in the gully, so I knew I 
was right by then. It was too narrow 
for the crawler and I’d gone in on 
foot. I didn’t dare follow Rick over 
the edge. But I flashed my light on 
the walls over the step, and he saw 
it and flashed his. So I went back to 
the crawler and got a rope and that 
was all.” 

“All?” asked Jim Talles. “I 
wouldn’t say so.” 

“Well, except for the luck. Rick 
said he’d been asleep down there 
for a while — the other end was 



blocked, and the crack the sun was 
shining through didn’t come within 
forty feet of his level. If he’d been 
asleep when I flashed my light, he’d 
be there now and I’d still be looking 
for the other end of the crack so as 
to guess my way away from him. 
But how did you know about that? 
Or were you guessing, too?” 

“That wasn’t what I had in 
mind; I neither knew nor guessed. 
I—” 

“I know what I want you to tell 
me,” cut in Jeb McCulloch. “I 
know you were right, but what 
made you decide that Rick had 
gone along the road to Lick E in- 
stead of the way up to Pic G as had 
been planned? I imagine that’s 
what Jim would like you to explain, 
though I realize he must know the 
answer.” 

“Easy enough,” Marie D’Nombu 
smiled. “Which way is Pic G from 
North-Down?” 

“Straight north, of course.” 
“Right. And Rick knew that 
from the maps. How did you find 
north, Rick?” 

The boy was surprised. “North 
Star, of course. You can see — ” 
Marie shook her head, and 
grinned at McCulloch. 

“No, Rick. It’s too bad you 
didn’t get here and start your hike a 
couple of hours later. Polaris would 
have been set by then, instead of 
hanging right above Lick E Pass — 
and when you couldn’t find it you 
might have remembered that it 
isn’t the North Star here. ” •

113 




down next to the tree, then 
squatted at his side. 

His blue eyes, once clear and 
bright, now watery with age and 
imbedded in a network of wrinkles, 
watched me. He reached inside his 
shirt and fumbled for something. I 
had always teased Yuri about his 
shirts; sooner or later he would tear 
them along the shoulder seams 
while flexing the muscles of his 
broad back and sturdy arms. But 
now those shirts, like his skin, hung 
on his bones in loose folds. At last 
he found what he was looking for, a 
crumpled sheet of paper that he 
pressed into my hand with trem- 
bling fingers. 

“Take care of this,” he whis- 
pered to me. “Copy it, so you’ll 
never lose the information. All the 
coordinates are there, all the places 
and times I visited these past 
months. When you’re lonely, when 
you need me, go to the Time 
Station and you’ll be able to join 
me on the other side.” He was 
trying to comfort me. He had been 
at the Time Station every day for 
the past six months, traveling to 
various points in the past. Thanks 
to the coordinate listing he had 
made, I could elect to travel to any 
of the same points and therefore be 
with him at those times. It suddenly 
struck me to attempt such reunions 
was a mad idea, an insane and des- 
perate course. 

“What happens to me?” I asked, 
clutching the paper. “What am I 
like when I’m with you? You’ve al- 



ready seen me all those times. 
What do I do, what happens to 
me?” 

“I can’t tell you, you know that. 
You have to decide of your own free 
will whether or not to chance it. 
Otherwise the process doesn’t work. 
I must not say anything that might 
affect your choice.” 

I looked away from him and 
toward the lake. Two golden swans 
glided by. The water barely rippled 
in their wake. Their shapes blurred 
and I realized I was crying silently. 
Yuri’s blue-veined hand rested on 
my shoulder. 

“Please, Nanette. You make it 
harder for me.” 

At last the tears stopped. I 
reached over and stroked his hair, 
once thick and blond, now thin and 
white. Only a year before we had 
come to this same tree, our bodies 
shiny with lake water after a moon- 
light swim, and had made love in 
the darkness. We were as young as 
everyone else, confident that we 
would live forever, forgetting that 
our bodies could not be rejuvenated 
indefinitely. 

“I’m not really leaving you,” said 
Yuri. His arms held me firmly and 
for a moment I thought his strength 
had returned. “Whenever you need 
me, you’ll find me on the other side 
of the Time Station. Think of it 
that way.” 

“All right,’’ I said, trying to 
smile. “Sure.” I nestled against 
him, my head on his chest, listen- 
ing to his once-strong heart as it 




thumped against my ear. 

Yuri died that night, only a few 
hours after we returned home. 

T Ihe relationships among our 
friends had been an elaborate 
but ever-changing web, couples 
breaking up and combining with 
others in a new pattern. We were 
all perpetually young and time had 
seemed to stretch ahead of us with 
no end. Throughout all of this, 
Yuri and I stayed together, the 
strands of our love becoming 
stronger instead of more tenuous. 
A shy, frightened girl when I met 
Yuri, I had been attracted by his 
boldness; he had appeared at my 
door one day, introduced himself. 
He told me a friend had made him 
promise he would get together with 
me. I could not have looked par- 
ticularly attractive with my slouch- 
ed bony body, my curly black hair 
that would not stay out of my face, 
my long legs marked with bruises 
by my clumsiness. But Yuri had 
loved me on sight and in time I had 
discovered that his boldness was 
the protective covering of a 
thoughtful and sensitive person. 

Our lives had become inter- 
twined so tightly that, after a while, 
they were one life. It was inconceiv- 
able that anything could separate 
us. Our daily existence, true, may 
have lacked the excitement many 
others knew. For with almost three 
centuries to live at the full height of 
one’s physical and mental powers, 
and the freedom to live several dif- 

IF EVER I SHOULD LEAVE YOU 



ferent kinds of lives, changing one’s 
profession and pursuits every 
twenty or thirty years, it was un- 
likely that anyone would choose to 
couple with the same person 
throughout. Yet Yuri and I had 
clung to each other, even through 
our changes, falling in love over 
and over again. We were lucky, I 
had thought. Supremely lucky. 

But now that Yuri was gone, I 
told myself that we had been fools. 
I could lead only half a life after his 
death. I was a ghost myself, wan- 
dering from friend to friend seeking 
consolation, then isolating myself 
in my house for days, unwilling to 
see anyone. 

Still there was solace in the 
knowledge that in a sense I could 
rejoin him if I had to. I had only to 
walk over to the Time Station, give 
them the coordinates he had listed 
for me, and I would be with him 
again, at least for a little while. Yet 
during those first weeks alone I 
could not bring myself to take the 
step. The fact is that he's gone, 
I would remind myself angrily. The 
rest is illusion. You must learn to 
live without him. And when I would 
retort, why? You have no life alone. 
Whether he is illusion or not, go to 
him. 

I began to wander past the Time 
Station, testing my resolve. I would 
walk almost to the door, within 
sight of the technicians, then re- 
treat, racing home, my hands 
shaking, my mind shrieking. Yuri! 

At last, one unhappy lonely 

115 




morning I charged through the 
glassy doorway of the Time Station 
and into the empty hall. Time 
portals surrounded me on all 
sides — silvery cubicles into which 
people could step, then disappear. 
A female technician approached 
me, silently offering assistance. I 
motioned her away and went over 
to one of the unoccupied cubicles. I 
snatched the precious paper from 
my pocket, stared at the first set of 
coordinates. I stepped inside the 
cubicle, reciting the coordinates 
aloud — time, place, duration of 
stay. 

Suddenly I felt as though my 
body were being thrown through 
space, as though my limbs were 
being torn from my torso. The walls 
around me had vanished. The vio- 
lent sensations lasted only an 
instant, Astounded, I looked 
around. I was now standing near a 
small, clear pool of water shadowed 
by palm trees>. 

I turned from the pool. Before 
me stretched a desolate waste, a 
rocky desert bleached almost white 
by the sun. I retreated further into 
the shade of the oasis, kneeled by 
the pool. 

“Yuri,” I whispered, dipping my 
hand into the coolness of the water. 
A pebble suddenly danced across 
the silvery surface. The ripples it 
made mingled with those my hand 
had created. 

I lifted my head. Yuri stood only 
a few feet away. He had barely 
begun to age. His face was still 



young, skin drawn tight across high 
cheekbones. His hair was only 
lightly speckled with silver. 

“Yuri,” I whispered again. I ran 
to him. 

after we swam we sat next to 
xV each other beneath the palms, 
our feet in the water. I was intoxi- 
cated with joy. Yuri smiled at me 
and skipped pebbles across the 
pool. My mind reeled drunkenly 
and whispered, he's alive, he's here 
with you, and he'll be with you in a 
hundred other places at a hundred 
other times. 

Yuri started to whistle a tune, 
one I had heard from him for as 
long as I had known him. I pursed 
my lips and tried to whistle along 
with him but failed, as I always 
had. 

“You’ll never learn to whistle,” 
he said. “You’ve had more than 
two hundred years and you still 
haven’t figured it out.” 

“I will,” I replied. “I’ve done 
everything else I ever wanted to do 
and I can’t believe a simple thing 
Idee whistling is going to defeat 
me.” 

“You’ll never learn,” he teased. 

“I will.” 

“You won’t.” He laughed. 

I raised my feet, then lowered 
them forcefully, splashing us both. 
Yuri let out a yell and I scrambled 
to my feet, stumbled into my san- 
dals and tried to run. He grabbed 
me around the waist. “I ought to 
spank you,” he said. “Instead, I 



116 



IF 




think I’ll kiss you.” 

The long kiss was delightful. 
‘‘But I still say you won’t learn 
how,” he whispered, eyes twink- 
ling. 

I pursed my lips to try again . 
and Yuri disappeared. My time was 
up. Once more I was thrown and 
torn. 

I was in the cubicle once more. 

I left the Time Station and 
walked home alone. 

I became a spendthrift, visiting 
the Time Station several times a 
week. Yuri and I met on the steps 
of a deserted Mayan pyramid; we 
argued about the mathematical 
theories of his friend Alney while 
jungle birds shrieked around us. I 
packed a few of his favorite foods 
and wines and met him in a Hawaii 
still awaiting the arrival of its first 
inhabitants. We sat together on a 
high rocky cliff in Africa. Far below 
us apelike creatures with bone 
weapons hunted for food. 

In my real-time existence I be- 
came busy again, working with a 
group designing dwelling-places in- 
side the enormous trees that sur- 
rounded the city. By tinkering with 
sequoia genes, the biologists had 
created these gigantic trees hun- 
dreds of years before reverse-time 
travel had been developed. The 
trunks were partially hollow, and it 
was possible to live inside them 
without harming the trees. Because 
of the pressing housing shortage, 
the work was considered important. 



I would hurry to the Time Station 
with my sketches of various de- 
signs, anxious to ask Yuri for 
advice or suggestions. 

But I had to watch Yuri age, as I 
had watched before. 

Each time I saw him, he was a 
little older, a little weaker. The fact 
was that going into the past meant 
seeing him age all over again. After 
a while our visits took on a tone of 
desperation. He grew more cau- 
tious about our choice of times and 
sites, advising me to meet him on 
deserted island beaches or inside 
empty summer homes of the twen- 
tieth century. Our talks with each 
other became more careful' as I 
grew afraid of arguing too vigor- 
ously with him and thus wasting the 
little time we had left together. 
Yuri noticed this and understood 
what it meant. 

‘‘Maybe I was wrong,” Yuri said 
to me after I showed him the final 
plans for the tree dwellings. I had 
been overly animated, trying to be 
cheerful, ignoring the signs of age 
that reminded me of his death to 
come. I couldn’t fool him. We had 
been together too long for that. “I 
wanted to make it easier for you to 
live without me, Nanette. But may- 
be I made things worse. If I hadn’t 
planned these visits, possibly you 
would have recovered by now ...” 

“Don’t,” I whispered. We were 
on a ledge near a deserted stretch of 
beach in southern France, hiding 
ourselves behind huge boulders 
from the family picnicking below 



IF EVER I SHOULD LEAVE YOU 



117 




us. “Don’t worry about me, 
please.” 

“You’ve got to face it. I can’t 
make too many more of these jour- 
neys. I’m growing weaker.” 

I tried to say something but my 
vocal cords seemed locked, frozen 
inside my throat. The voices of the 
frolicking children on the beach 
reached my ears with piercing 
clarity. I wondered idly if any of 
them would survive the coming 
war. 

Yuri held my hand, opened his 
lips to say something else, then 
vanished. I clutched at the empty 
air in desperation. “No!” I scream- 
ed. “Not yet! Come back!” 

I found .myself once again at the 
Time Station. 

I had been a spendthrift. Now I 
became a miser, going to the 
Station only once or twice a month, 
trying to stretch out the remaining 
time I could spend with Yuri. I was 
no longer working on the tree 
dwellings. We had finished our 
designs and now those who enjoyed 
working with their hands would 
undertake the construction. 

A paralysis seized me. I would 
spend days alone in my house, 
unable even to dress myself, wan- 
dering from one room to another. I 
would sleep fitfully, then rise and 
after sitting idly for hours alone 
would fall asleep again. 

Once I forced myself to walk to 
the Slumber House and asked them 
to put me to sleep for a month. I 
felt no different after awakening 



but at least I had been able to pass 
that lonely month in unconscious- 
ness. I went to the Time Station, 
visited Yuri, returned to the Slum- 
ber House, asked for another 
month of oblivion. When I awoke 
the second time two men were 
standing over me shaking their 
heads. They told me I would have 
to see a Counselor before they 
would put me to sleep again. 

I had been a Counselor once my- 
self, and I knew all their tricks and 
wanted none of them. Instead, I 
trudged home and there waited out 
the time between my visits. 

The back-travel could not go on 
indefinitely. The list of remaining 
coordinates grew shorter. At last 
there was only one set left. I knew I 
would see Yuri once more only. 

W e met at a lovely summer 
home that overlooked a pic- 
turesque river. It was autumn there 
and Yuri began to shiver in the cool 
air. I managed to open the back 
door. We walked in, careful not to 
disturb anything. 

Yuri lay down on one of the 
couches. Outside, the thickly wood- 
ed area that surrounded the house 
was bright with color — orange, red, 
yellow. A half-grown fawn with 
white spots on his back peered in 
through a window, then disappear- 
ed among the trees. 

“Do you regret anything?” Yuri 
suddenly asked. I sat down on the 
couch, stroked his white hair and 
managed a smile. 



118 



IF 




“Nothing.” 

“You’re sure?” 

“Yes,” I said, trying to keep my 
voice from quavering. 

“I have one regret — that I didn’t 
meet you sooner!” 

“I know.” We had talked about 
our first meeting at least a thou- 
sand times. The conversation had 
become a ritual, but we never tired 
of it. “You were so blatant, Yuri. 
Coming to my door like that, out of 
nowhere. I thought you were a little 
crazy.” 

He smiled up at me and repeated 
what he had said then. “Hello. I’m 
Yuri Malenkov. A — a friend of 
mine made me promise to look you 
up. Do you mind if I join you for a 
while?” 

“And I was so surprised I let you 
in.” 

“And I never left.” 

“I know, and you’re still 
around.” Tears stung my eyes. 

“You were the only person I 
could talk to honestly, right from 
the beginning.” 

By then tears were bathing my 
cheeks. “Yuri! What will I do now? 
You can’t leave me. You can’t die 
again.” 

“Why torture yourself?” he whis- 
pered. “You don’t have much 
longer yourself. Haven’t you no- 
ticed, darling?” 

“What?” 

“Get up, Nanette. Look in that 
mirror over the fireplace.” 

I walked over to the mirror, 
stared into it. The signs were un- 

IF EVER I SHOULD LEAVE YOU 



mistakeable. My black hair was 
sprinkled with silver. Tiny lines 
were etched into the skin around 
my eyes. 

“I’m dying,” I said hoarsely. 
“My body isn’t rejuvenating itself 
any more!” I felt a sudden rush of 
panic. Then the fear and confusion 
vanished, replaced by a deep calm. 
I hurried back to Yuri’s side. 

“It won’t be long,” he said. “Try 
to do something meaningful with 
those last months. We’ll be to- 
gether again soon, if only in death. 
Just keep thinking of that.” 

“All right, Yuri,” I whispered. 
Then I kissed him for the last time. 

W hat was I to do with the time 
left to me? I had trained as a 
Counselor many years before and 
had worked as one before choosing 
a new profession. I decided to draw 
on my old experience to help those 
who, like myself, faced death. 

I found them for the most part 
unable to accept their fate. They 
were used to their youthfulness and 
their full lives, feeling invulnerable 
to anything except an accident. The 
suddenness with which old age des- 
cended on them drove some to hy- 
steria and they would concoct wild 
schemes to bring back their youth. 
One man, a biologist, spoke to me 
and then decided to spend his last 
months in the elusive search for im- 
mortality. Another man, who had 
recently fallen in love with a young 
girl, cried on my shoulder and I 
didn’t know whether to weep for 



119 




hhn or the girl he was leaving be- 
hind. A woman came to me, only 
seventy and already aging, deprived 
by fluke of throwback-gene of her 
normal life span. I began to forget 
about myself in talking with these 
people. 

Occasionally I would walk 
through the city and visit old 
friends. My mind was aging also. 
On these walks I found myself lost 
in memories of the past, memories 
clearer to me now than those of 
more recent events. 

I might have gone on that way, if 
I had not passed the Time Station 
one warm evening while sorting my 
thoughts. As I walked by, I saw 
Onel Lialla, dressed as a techni- 
cian, looking much the same as 
when I had known him. 

An idea struck me. Within sec- 
onds, it had formed itself in my 
mind and became an obsession. / 
can do it, I thought, Onel will not 
refuse me. 

Onel had been a mathematician. 
He had left the city a long time 
before and I had heard nothing of 
him since. I hurried to his side. 

“Onel?” 

His large dark eyes turned towad 
me. Uncertainty was written on his 
classically handsome face. Then he 
recognized me. 

He clasped my arms. He said 
nothing at first, perhaps embar- 
rassed by the signs of my approach- 
ing death. “Your smile hasn’t 
changed,” he said finally. 

We walked toward the park, 



talking of old times. I was surprised 
at how little he had changed. He 
was still courtly, still fancied 
himself the young knight in shining 
armor. The dark «yes still paid me 
homage in spite of my being an old 
gray-haired woman. Blinded by his 
innate romanticism Onel saw only 
what he wished to see. 

Twenty years before, barely more 
than a boy, Onel had fallen in loVe 
with me. It had not taken me long 
to realize that, being a romantic, he 
did not really wish to attain the ob- 
ject of his affections and had prob- 
ably unconsciously settled on me 
because I was so deeply involved 
with Yuri. Onel was in love with 
love. He had followed me every- 
where, pouring out his heart. I had 
tried to be kind, not wanting to 
make him bitter, and had spent as 
much time as I could in conversa- 
tion with him about his problems. 
Onel had finally left the city — “to 
forget”, as he had put it. I let him 
go, realizing that this too was part 
of his romantic game. 

Onel not only had not forgotten; 
he remembered every detail. We sat 
in the park under one of the crystal- 
line willows and he paid court 
again. “I’m still grateful for your 
kindness,” he said to me. “I swore 
I would repay it someday. If there’s 
anything I can do for you, I’m 
yours to command.” He sighed 
dramatically at this point. 

“There is something,” I replied. 

“What is it, Nanette?”

my lap. “I want you,” I went on, 
“to come to the Time Station with 
me. You’re one of the technicians 
there, aren’t you? Well, send me 
back to this park two hundred and 
forty years ago. I want to see the 
scenes of my youth one last time.” 
Onel was stunned. “You know I 
can’t do that! The portal can’t send 
you to any time you’ve actually 
lived through. We’d have people 
bumping into themselves, or going 
back to give their earlier selves ad- 
vice. Impossible!” 

“The portal can be overridden,” 
I said. “You know how. Send me 
through.” 

“I can’t, Nanette. Believe me — ” 
“Onel, I don’t want to change 
anything. I don’t even want to talk 
to anybody.” 

“If you changed the past . .” 
“I won’t. Why should I? I had a 
happy life. Besides, I’ll go back to a 
day when I wasn’t in the park. It 
would give me a little pleasure be- 
fore I die to see things as they were. 
Is that asking too much?” 

“I can’t,” he said. “Don’t ask it 
of me. Please.” 

Finally he gave in, as I knew he 
would. We made our way to the 
Station. Hands shaking, Onel ad- 
justed a portal and sent me 
through. 

H e had given me four hours. I 
appeared in the park behind a 
large red refreshment tent. Inside 
the tent people sat at small round 
tables enjoying delicacies and oc- 



casionally rising to sample the pink 
wine that flowed from a fountain in 
the center. As a girl I had cooked in 
that tent, removing raw foodstuffs 
from the transformer in the back 
and spending hours in the kitchen 
making the desserts, which were 
my specialty. I had almost for- 
gotten the tents that had been 
replaced later on by more elaborate 
structures. 

I walked past the red tent toward 
the lake. It too was as I remember- 
ed it, surrounded by oaks and a few 
weeping willows. Biologists had not 
yet developed the silvery vines and 
glittering crystal trees so profuse in 
later centuries. A peacock strutted 
past as I headed for a nearby 
bench. I wanted only to sit for a 
while near the lake, perhaps visit 
one of the tents before I returned to 
my own time. 

I watched my feet as I walked, 
being careful not to stumble. The 
people m the park ignored me, 
probably annoyed by the presence 
of an old woman who reminded 
them of their eventual fate. Once I 
had been like them, avoiding those 
who so obviously would soon be 
dead, uncomfortable around those 
who were dying when I had every- 
thing ahead of me. 

Suddenly a face was in front of 
me and I collided with a muscular 
young body. Unable to regain my 
balance, I fell. 

A hand was held out to me. I 
grasped it and struggled upright. 
“I’m terribly sorry,” said a voice, a 



IF EVER I SHOULD LEAVE YOU 



121 




voice I had come to know well, and 
I looked up at the face with its wide 
cheekbones and clear blue eyes. 

“Yuri!” I blurted. 

He was startled. “Do I know 
you?” he asked. 

“I attended one of your lec- 
tures,” I said quickly, “on hologra- 
phic art.” 

He seemed to relax a bit. “I’ve 
only given one,” he said. “Last 
week. I’m surprised you remember 
my name.” 

“Do you think,” I said, anxious 
now to hang on to him for a while, 
“you could help' me over to that 
bench?” 

“You bet.” I hobbled over to it, 
clinging to his arm. By the time we 
sat down he was already expanding 
on points he had covered in the 
lecture. He was apparently uncon- 
cerned about my obvious aging and 
seemed happy to talk to me. 

A thought struck me like a blow: 
Yuri had not yet met my past self. I 
had never attended that first lec- 
ture — I met him just before he was 
to do his second. Desperately I 
tried to remember the date I had 
given Onel. 

I had not counted on this. I was 
jumpy, worried that I would indeed 
change something, that by meeting 
Yuri in the park in this fashion I 
might somehow prevent his meet- 
ing me in the future. I shuddered. I 
knew little of the circumstances 
that had brought him to my door. I 
could somehow be interfering with 
them. 



Yuri finished what he had to say 
and waited for my reaction. “You 
have some interesting insights,” I 
said. “I’m looking forward to your 
next lecture.” I smiled and nodded, 
hoping that he would now leave and 
go about his business. 

Instead he looked at me thought- 
fully. “I don’t know if I’ll give any 
more lectures,” he said. 

My stomach turned over. I knew 
he had given ten more. “Why not?” 
I asked as calmly as I could. 

He shrugged. “Lots of reasons,” 
he muttered. 

“Maybe,” I said in desperation, 
“you should talk about it. That 
might help.” Hurriedly I dredged 
up all the techniques I had learned 
as a Counselor, carefully question- 
ing him, until at last he opened up, 
flooding me with his fears and 
worries. 

He became the Yuri I remember- 
ed, with an intense and warm sensi- 
tivity he concealed under a cold, 
flippant exterior. He had grown 
tired of the superficiality of most of 
the city’s citizens, uncomfortable 
because so many resented his 
awareness and penetration. He was 
unsuited to the gaiety and playful- 
ness that surrounded him, wanting 
to pursue whatever he did with 
single-minded devotion. 

He looked embarrassed after 
telling me all this, began once more 
to withdraw behind his shield. “I 
have some tentative plans,” he said 
calmly, regaining control. “I may 
be leaving here in a couple of days

with one of the scientific expedi- 
tions to Venus. I prefer the 
company of dedicated people, and 
I’ve been offered a place on the 
ship.” 

My hands trembled. Neither of 
us had gone with an expedition un- 
til five years after our meeting. 

“I’m sorry for bothering you with 
my problems,” he went on. “I don’t 
usually inflict them on strangers, or 
anyone else for that matter. I’d 
better be on my way.” 

He stood up, started to walk off. 
Why hadn’t I thought of it before? 
I knew what I had to do. 
“Wait!” I cried. “Wait a minute. 
Do you think you could humor an 
old lady, maybe take some advice?” 
“It depends,” he said stiffly, “on 
the advice.” 

“I think you need some proper 
company before you go on that ex- 
j>edition. Do you think you could 
visit a girl I think might enjoy talk- 
ing to you?” 

His chin lifted. He had the 
normal reflexes, as well I knew. “A 
girl? Is she pretty?” 

I ducked that one. “She’s a lot 
like you. You’d find her sympa- 
thetic.” I told him where I had 
lived then and gave him my name. 
“But don’t let on that an old lady 
sent you — she might think I’m 
meddling. Just say it was a friend.” 
He smiled. ‘‘I promise.” He 
turned to leave. ‘‘Thank you, 
friend.” I watched him as he 
ambled down the pebbled path that 
would lead him to my dpor.

I ’m asked a number of questions 
about reviewing books whenever 
I’m on a discussion panel or in 
letters I sometimes get from read- 
ers. How do I go about selecting the 
books for review? Why do I seem to 
favor certain publishers and writ- 
ers? How much personal bias goes 
into the selection? And what makes 
me so sure my judgment is infal- 
lible? 

My judgment, of course, isn’t 
infallible. But I’d much rather state 
my opinions honestly than duck the 
issue and tell readers nothing at all 
bout a book. The judgments have 
to be based on my own reactions, 
rather than on any absolute cri- 
teria — and as far as I can I try to 
state my reasons for feeling as I do 



about any book. Naturally, per- 
sonal bias affects those reactions. 
I’m biased in favor of science 
fiction that serves primarily as 
entertainment. I like a good story, 
reasonably well told — for me, no 
amount of message can replace 
that. I like stories that have satis- 
factory (though not necessarily 
happy) endings. I prefer interesting 
characters doing something that is 
important to them. And I want to 
see consistent and well-developed 
backgrounds. Above all, I want to 
see something in science fiction 
that carries me beyond the events 
and limits of 1974. 

Far more books are submitted to 
me for comment and critique than I 
have time to read. The ones I do 



126 




read — and hence can review — are 
the ones that arouse my interest 
from dust-jacket copy, from my ex- 
perience with the writer and from a 
hasty scan. (I probably use about 
the same criteria here as most 
readers use in buying a book.) For 
instance, I’ll almost always read a 
book by Anderson, Dickson, 
Clarke or Simak. Certain writers 
have disappointed me so often that 
it takes quite a lot of cover and in- 
side promise to convince me to try. 
Newer writers I approach with both 
hope and doubt. I’ll read at least 
part of a new writer’s book — but I 
don’t comment on any work I 
haven’t finished, of course, and 
many lose me before I’m through. 

But my first consideration has to 
be to readers. I’ve had too many ex- 
periences of reading a glowing 
review of a book that has been off 
the stands for six months, so I try 
hard to review books that will be 
available when this column comes 
out. That means I favor publishers 
who get copies to me well ahead of 
publication date, or those who send 
me advance galley sheets. (They’re 
harder to read, but those books will 
be on the stands when the reviews 
are read.) Some publishers don’t 
send me most of their books — I buy 
a few of these, but don’t try to look 
at all of them. And some who print 
science fiction seem to send review- 
ers only their occult books on the 
assumption that sf and occult are 
the same. I don’t bother much with 
these. 



I also tend to review the softcover 
books in preference to hardcover 
ones. First, such books get a lot less 
reviewing generally. Second, read- 
ers can afford to buy a good many 
more of the cheaper editions. And I 
usually don’t review anthologies be- 
cause it’s impossible to do more 
than list stories and authors in a 
brief review — and such a listing 
means very little. When an anthol- 
ogy is of sufficient value, it takes up 
most of a monthly column. 

I try to review two kinds of 
books. The first are those so good 
as entertainment that I want the 
readers to enjoy them. The second 
are the ones I find so bad that I 
want to warn Teaders not to waste 
money on them. I’d much rather 
review the first kind, even though a 
review of the second type may be 
more fun to read. 

And finally, having stated my 
general principles, I feel free to 
violate any or all of them when 
something seems important enough 
to deserve special mention. 

F or instance, there’s one book 
that won’t interest 99 per cent 
of the readers of this column. It’s in 
French, is a lot of trouble to obtain 
and is expensive. Yet it’s a book of 
major importance for the field. 
This is Encyclopedic de VUtopie 
des Voyages Extraordinaires et de 
la Science Fiction, by Pierre Ver- 
sins (L’Age d’Homme). The only 
source for it which I’ve found in 
North America is: Bruce Robbins,

$71.00, postage paid! 

This encyclopedia is a truly 
monumental work and as far as I 
know, the only one of its kind. In 
its 997 pages, Versins has included 
almost every fact about science fic- 
tion available to a student of the 
field living in France. There is no 
English translation, though I un- 
derstand one is contemplated for 
some indefinite future, but if you’ve 
had even high-school French, it 
shouldn’t be too difficult to read. 

Its value is so great that I happily 
paid full price for my copy. Yet it 
has limitations. Versins had ob- 
viously read everything he could 
find in English, as well as other lan- 
guages. But a good deal of Ameri- 
can science fiction must not have 
been available. The listings of 
works by a number of authors have 
serious deficiencies and some au- 
thors who should be included are 
not there. 

The above is not surprising. A 
work done here would inevitably 
show deficiencies in its coverage of 
European science fiction. But it 
does indicate that we need more 
than a translation. We need further 
scholarship, based on Versins’ 
encyclopedia and going on to cover 
the American and British fields — 
the richest of all sources of science 
fiction — in greater detail. I hope 
that some ambitious fan or group 
of fans will turn to this project. It 
will require immense effort and 



high scholarship, but it’s a labor 
that badly needs doing. Until such 
work can be done, however, Ver- 
sins has made a tremendous contri- 
bution to science fiction that should 
not be overlooked. 

another book that may not in- 
terest the casual reader but 
will fascinate anyone interested in 
the beginnings of science fiction is 
The Crystal Man , by Edward Page 
Marshall (Doubleday, $7.95). This 
was “collected . with a bio- 
graphical perspective by Sam Mos- 
kowitz.” The stories in the collec- 
tion appeared about a hundred 
years ago, most in the columns of 
the New York Sun. Many of them 
use ideas that later won such 
authors as H. G. Wells fame as a 
writer of science fiction. There is 
time-travel by machine, invisibil- 
ity — strangely anticipating Wells’ 
Invisible Man — and a host of other 
fictional inventions. 

Surprisingly I found a number of 
them to be quite good stories. And 
all of them were fascinating. The 
treatment of racial prejudice in one 
story, dealing with freezing for sus- 
pended animation, was almost 
modern — except that it dealt with 
prejudice against Chinese instead 
of blacks. In fact, the book offers a 
provocative perspective on our 
current world of science fiction that 
should delight any student of the 
field. 

There is also a lengthy introduc- 
tion by Moskowitz which traces the 



128 



IF 




history of Mitchell, of the Sun, and 
of the development of science 
fiction in the nineteenth century. 
Considerable evidence is offered 
that Wells and other writers might 
have been influenced by Mitchell’s 
work. Certainly the parallels are 
amazing. But I’m not fully con- 
vinced — read it yourself for the 
evidence. 

My only quarrel with the book 
derives from what Moskowitz did 
not tell — a strangeness indeed 
when dealing with his work. He 
says that most readers wouldn’t be 
interested in how he came to dis- 
cover these buried and neglected 
stories. But in talking to him, I 
learned a little of that account and 
found it totally fascinating. I wish 
he’d spent much more time on how 
the discoveries were made! 

N ormally, as I stated, I prefer 
not to review anthologies. But 
occasionally one is too good to 
miss. Jupiter, by Frederik and 
Carol Pohl (Ballantine, $1.25), is 
such a one. This is also a “theme” 
anthology — something I usually 
dislike. The approaching Jupiter 
flyby is the inspiration behind the 
idea of getting together a book of 
major stories centered about the 
big planet. But the curious fact is 
that stories dealing with Jupiter are 
rather rare in fiction — but most of 
them have been extraordinarily 
good. Here we have Call Me Joe by 
Poul Anderson, Desertion by Clif- 
ford D. Simak, Bridge by James 



Blish, Medusa by Arthur C. Clarke. 
Weinbaum, Gallun, Asimov and 
others are also represented. Almost 
all of the stories are excellent. 

In fact, the only really bad story 
is one by me. It’s one of my earliest 
ones, deals with rocket racing and 
depends on a trick. Unfortunately, 
when I mentioned it to the Pohls, I 
hadn’t read it over for more than 
thirty years, or I’d have kept my 
mouth shut. Part of it isn’t my 
fault — somehow in getting the story 
set into type, several lines were 
omitted, which makes it seem that 
Jupiter has no atmosphere — a fact I 
knew to be false when I wrote the 
story, since Jupiter has an incred- 
ibly thick atmosphere. Still, in 
those days I took too much for 
granted. I figured out the course of 
my rocket to Jupiter correctly — but 
then neglected to figure just how 
fast a rocket would have to be 
moving to be swung into a circular 
orbit close around the big planet. 
When I did figure it — recently — I 
was shocked at how ridiculous my 
original assumption had been. Oh, 
well, it’s a small flaw in a splendid 
collection. Generally Jupiter seems 
to have inspired the very best work 
and thinking from writers. 

I try to avoid reviewing books 
that are essentially fantasy, but 
sometimes I can’t resist. Anyhow, 
the borderline is sometimes hard to 
establish. Is a story based on 
psi-powers fantasy or science fic- 
tion? I personally consider it fan- 



READING ROOM 



129 




tasy, but it has been the substruc- 
ture of a great deal of science fic- 
tion. And how about alternate uni- 
verses? Normally these are consid- 
ered science fiction. But a fair 
amount of modern fantasy has 
made use of both devices. 

Katherine Kurtz has been writ- 
ing a series of books about the 
Deryni, a group of people using psi- 
power in an alternate Wales of 
sometime around the tenth cen- 
tury, where history has branched 
off completely from the one we 
know. They’re published as fan- 
tasy — and I guess they are — but 
they’ve been fascinating enough for 
me to have already reviewed the 
series in these columns. Deryni 
Checkmate was an excellent novel, 
the second in the series, with 
tremendous promise for the future. 
A mysterious background figure, 
St. Camber, seemed to be behind 
all the factors acting upon the psi- 
gifted and persecuted Deryni. 
There was a fanatic figure crusad- 
ing for the death of all Deryni — 
Warin, probably himself an un- 
knowing Deryni. There was warfare 
within the Church, coming to a 
head as the reactionary elements 
threatened to excommunicate Mor- 
gan (the hero of sorts) and to place 
all the lands under the Interdict. 
And to make matters worse, we had 
an invading ruler, a full Deryni 
with developed powers, planning 
conquest of the whole region. 

Lovely background for rich de- 
velopment. Unfortunately, Volume 



III of the Deryni Chronicles — High 
Deryni (Ballantine, $1.25) — takes 
all these problems and reduces 
them to piffle, rather than working 
them out. It is, I’m afraid, a classic 
example of a new writer working 
out all the first steps and then 
copping out at the end. The 
menace of the Church seems 
quietly to become of less and less 
importance as the sympathetic 
sections gain power to help Mor- 
gan. Warin, this devoted, totally 
stubborn fanatic, has a meeting 
with Morgan and is quickly con- 
vinced that Morgan is a good guy — 
so he joins forces with Morgan. 
Then we have a hubbub back- 
ground in the castle of the invader 
where we meet a mysterious (?) 
figure who later turns up to solve 
everything. We are finally treated 
to a duel of magic, which is fine; 
but it’s all settled when the 
mysterious background figure 
turns out to be St. Camber, whose 
death somehow seems to solve 
everything. The menaces have all 
turned out to be paper dragons — 
fierce-looking but actually harm- 
less — and the solution is by deus (or 
sanctus) ex machina. 

This is a great pity. In one novel 
the author has ruined everything 
that was built up in the previous 
two. And while she is supposed to 
be working on later novels in the 
series, I don’t see how she can over- 
come the wreckage left by this third 
volume. Her only hope would be to 
go back and completely redo this

most never done after a work has 
already been published. 

Not recommended. If you’ve 
already read the first two books, 
don’t read this one. You’re better 
off with unsolved mysteries and un- 
resolved conflicts than with what 
you’re now offered. 

O n the cover of Hunters of the 
Red Moon, by Marion Zimmer 
Bradley, (DAW, 95c) is a state- 
ment about the author by Theodore 
Sturgeon: “A writer of absolute 
competence . who should be 
more widely read.” I am in total 
agreement with that sentiment. 
Bradley has been moving ahead 
steadily, writing better and better 
with experience. She has always 
chosen to write action-adventure 
stories of pure entertainment, and 
her novels are fine stories of that 
type. She can be relied on for good 
backgrounds, characters and cul- 
tures that are colorful, and well-re- 
solved plots. 

This is a good example of her 
craftsmanship. The initial idea 
isn’t new— a man captured by an 
alien ship as a slave — but what she 
does with it is more than adequate- 
ly refreshing. Her central character 
and a group of well-chosen aliens 
are sold to a mysterious culture that 
intends to use them as intelligent 
prey in a ritualistic hunt. They can 
win freedom and honor by surviv-

the who, what, and why of the 
hunters. There’s also a good devel- 
opment of relations among the 
aliens and the human of the band 
of “prey” we follow. Recommended 
to all adventure readers. 

D on w()llheim at DAW is cur- 
1 rently experimenting with an 
idea that has been tried before in 
science fiction, but has never been 
done properly. This is the idea of a 
series of books about a single char- 
acter (and usually, others sur- 
rounding him.) The only fully 
successful example of this so far is 
the Perry Rhodan series — but these 
are on what I consider a very primi- 
tive level of science fiction. The 
Captain Future series did fairly well 
in the magazines, years ago, but 
died — perhaps of too heavy a load 
of formula. 

This time we have “Cap Ken- 
nedy” in #1 of the series: Galaxy of 
the Lost, by Gregory Kern (DAW, 
75c). Gregory Kern is what’s called 
a “house name” — that is, a pen 
name owned by the publisher, 
rather than the writer. Wollheim 
claims Kern is an established 
science fiction writer, but isn’t re- 
vealing the true name. And the 
back cover sets forth the intentions 
for the series, as opposed to 
previous series attempts. 

Well, I suppose it’s unfair to 
judge a project by only one 
example — but that’s the only way it 
can be judged so far. 

On the whole the novel does 



avoid the primitiveness and the 
formula that has plagued so much 
“great hero” series writing, both in 
and out of science fiction. Kennedy 
is a grown-up hero and the group 
around him is not made up of the 
usual smart-aleck type-cast char- 
acters we’ve met too often. They 
consist of a strong man from a 
heavy planet, an older scientist and 
an alien with chameleon talents. 
They take their work seriously and 
sensibly, as does Kennedy. 

The problem is held within 
sensible bounds, also. It does offer 
some menace to all humanity, but 
only because ships are being sucked 
out of space (into an interesting al- 
ternate universe), with the heart of 
the problem Kennedy’s own per- 
sonal danger in this alien universe. 
Almost all of the typical errors of a 
series seem to be avoided. 

But somehow, some of the 
virtues seem to have been missed, 
too. It’s probably too early to 
develop Kennedy and his friends 
fully, but I’d like to feel more 
involved with him. I seem to watch 
him, rather than to share with him. 
And while the problem is complete- 
ly workable, it never reaches me 
emotionally. I can’t find much 
wrong with the novel — but I can’t 
find much enthusiasm for it, either. 

I think we’ll have to wait and see 
on this series. In the meantime it’s 
probably a good idea to try this first 
example. There’s no reason why it 
shouldn’t work out well, so let’s 
hope it will. •

IF 





D oug allard had changed the 
points and plugs, boiled out 
the carb and tuned his scoot to a 
razor edge. That had been back in 
Denver. By all the rules of God and 
man, the engine should have been 
running as smooth as the black lac- 
quer on the tank and frame. 

But every time the lightning 
flashed over the hulking backbone 
of the Rockies the engine broke up 
for a few beats. It sounded like 
loose crud in the fuel lines — which 
there damn well was not. Or maybe 
dirt in the jets or one of those elec- 
trical glitches that could take you a 
week to run down. Though the 
slope grew steep as it wound up 
toward the high passes, the road 
was almost empty and the bends 
were still gentle. Doug was able to 
try various engine speeds in every 
gear but could detect no relation 
between engine speed and the weird 



coughing in the Harley’s guts. She 
broke up at thirty, at forty-five, at 
sixty, at eighty — every time the 
lightning flashed. 

Doug did not like it at all. First, 
because he had never heard of an 
electrical storm’s causing an engine 
to break up — and second, because 
of the thing he had about electricity. 

Doug felt no fear in the face of 
things that would turn the knees of 
the average citizen to lime jello. 
Courage came with the colors of the 
Avengers. But he believed that elec- 
tricity was out to get him in ways 
large and small. Once he and his 
old partner Ted had been tooling 
along through a light drizzle in 
Florida. Out of nowhere a power 
line along the road suddenly snap- 
ped, whizzed past Doug’s cheek 
like a cobra spitting sparks, caught 
Ted across the chest and fried him 
where he sat. And almost every 



133 




time Doug’s chopper was laid up 
with something he could not handle 
himself, it was some electrical 
gremlin. Doug and electricity just 
did not get along. To him, electric- 
ity in any and all of its manifesta- 
tions was a cold-eyed snake — like 
the power line that had killed 
Ted — out to sink its sparky teeth in 
his hide. 

So the idea that those lightning 
bolts flashing across the darkening 
sky were somehow subverting their 
little brothers in the ignition system 
not only scared him. It enraged 
him. 

“Lay off my scoot, mother!” he 
muttered at the approaching elec- 
trical storm, feeling foolish for 
threatening thin air but better for 
having done it. 

Doug was headed west across the 
Rockies to join up with the 
Avengers in Los Angeles. He was 
coming from St. Louis after selling 
off a crummy grocery store his 
Uncle Bill had left him. The damn- 
ed electrical storm seemed to be 
headed east after god-knows-what, 
so it was not long before the fire- 
works were directly overhead. 

Lightning danced through a 
slate-gray sky, slamming and 
cracking like an artillery barrage as 
Doug leaned through the turns. He 
was taking them as fast as he could, 
trying to make as much time as 
possible before the deluge. 

The sky grew darker, wilder. Yet 
still no rain fell. Sheets of blinding 
light ripped the heavens every thirty 

134 



seconds or so, illuminating the 
forested mountains like enormous 
flashbulbs; and the Harley’s engine 
was coughing more often than not. 
Doug’s head rang from the crack 
and rumble of the thunder as the 
throttle hesitations were making 
the bike harder and harder to 
control. 

One weird mother of a storm! 

Up ahead the road took a gentle 
left and climbed around a tree- 
covered hill. As he started to put 
the bike over, Doug smelled elec- 
tricity in the air so thick he almost 
choked on it. Looking up at the 
crest, he saw a searing white bolt of 
lightning kiss the concrete not 
twenty yards in front of him and ac- 
tually walk toward him before it 
disappeared in a clap of thunder. 



T hen he was cresting the hill, 
leaning into the left turn at 
fifty-five — and the world suddenly 
turned blinding, crazy yellow. 
Everything seemed to happen at 
once and in slow motion. Through 
the handlebars he felt a tremen- 
dous jar. The whole frame was vib- 
rating as if someone had bonged it 
with a sledgehammer. His body 
tingled, he choked on ozone, and 
the engine quit entirely. The chop 
started to fall but some sixth sense 
told him that if he went down in 
that instant or even allowed his foot 
to touch the road he would have 
had it. Standing up on the pegs, 
still blinded, he threw his body to 

IF 




the right as hard as he could 
against the bank of the turn, com- 
pensating for the sudden drop in 
speed. The Harley wobbled insane- 
ly. Thunder walloped his eardrums 
but his vision began to clear. 

He saw dimly that he was careen- 
ing across the road, thumping and 
bounding toward a steep drop into 
the thickly wooded gully to the 
right. He downshifted, slammed on 
the brakes. The wheels kicked up 
dirt and screamed. Forward mo- 
mentum was killed and the scoot 
gently slid out from under him. As 
he rolled away from the bike, losing 
a certain amount of skin, he 
shouted in triumph. 

How many riders had been hit by 
lightning and lived? Whoo-eee! 

Picking himself off the ground 
and making sure nothing major 
was broken, he thought next of the 
Harley. The chop was lying on its 
side in tall grass, about three yards 
short of having rolled into the 
ru*gged-looking little canyon. 
Grunting, Doug erected it on its 
still functional stand and inspected 
the damage. The right front peg 
was bent at a crazy angle. There 
was a small rip in the black leather 
of the seat. A lot of little dings and 
scratches marred the right side of 
the bike where it had skidded along 
the ground. A strange jagged strip 
of paint had peeled off the tank and 
the metal beneath was etched a 
dark blue as if the storm had 
branded the chop with its own 
mark. 



So all things considered, his 
scoot had come through in fine 
shape — all it seemed tb need was 
having the peg hammered back 
into position. Some paint, chrome 
polish and new leather, and the 
Harley would be as slick as before it 
was hit. But he would try to retain 
that lightning brand on the tank — 
maybe try some clear lacquer over 
it. It was unique. It gave the chop 
character that no amount of plan- 
ning, design or hard work could 
have matched. 

Only when he had finished 
inspecting the bike did he notice 
the peculiar changes in his sur- 
roundings. For one thing, the sky 
was already clear of storm clouds. 
For another, the sun was about two 
hours lower than it had been when 
he was hit only minutes before. 
And the surface of the road was 
cracked, pitted, torn by holes as far 
as he could see. The fir trees were 
wrong, too — taller and thinner 
than they should have been, the 
needles sparse on the branches but 
almost four inches long and colored 
a nauseating grayish green. The air 
had a chemical aftertaste. Also it 
seemed to have a faint greenish- 
brown tint to it as if the worst Los 
Angeles smog he could remember 
and then some had managed to 
penetrate the high Rockies. He had 
the feeling that every breath was 
doing awful things to his lungs. 
Everything seemed old and sick 
and generally cruddy. 

Muttering to himself and repeat- 



EYE OF THE STORM 



135 




edly glancing back over his shoul- 
der for reasons he could not figure, 
Doug hammered the bad peg back 
into position with his heaviest 
wrench. He checked out his carb 
and fuel lines, then tromped on the 
starter. 

Nothing happened. Not even a 
cough. He stomped on the starter 
another time. Ten times. Without 
raising a peep. He swung off the 
bike, took a deep breath, looked 
around at the grayish sickly forest 
and ruined road, shuddered, and 
tried to dope it out. He just knew it 
had to be something electrical. 
Hell — of course! 

Sure enough, the fuse was blown. 
When he dug out his little card- 
board box of spares he found they 
were blown, too. Electricity had 
done him in again. 

But Doug Allard was damned if 
he was going to sit in that crummy- 
looking place just because he had 
no fuses for his chop. Swearing, he 
fished out a half-empty cigarette 
pack, dumped out the smokes. He 
stripped off the tinfoil, wadded it 
up and jammed it into the gap in 
the fuseholder. It might not provide 
the protection of a proper fuse but 
he would have to risk it. Either 
that, or sit here in this wilderness 
until something came along. From 
the looks of the road, that might be 
never. 

When he kicked the starter this 
time, the engine caught right away. 
But it burbled and chugged as if 
the mixture were too rich, although 



he knew damned well he had tuned 
it to perfection back in Denver. He 
sniffed the brown air and remem- 
bered an old joke about Los 
Angeles smog. On a really bad day, 
they used to say, you could just take 
the cap off your tank and run your 
engine on the freaked air. Could 
this air here be so rank that it was 
making his mixture too rich? 

Sure enough, when he leaned it 
out a bit, the engine ran smooth as 
melted butter. Whoo-ee! This air 
made L.A. atmosphere seem like 
pure oxygen. 

He cautiously started up what 
was left of the road, skirting huge 
potholes and jagged breaks every 
few yards of the way, creeping 
along at thirty-five and wishing his 
scoot were set up for scrambles. 
And wondering where the hell he 
was. 

according to the map there was 
a dinky little town about forty 
miles up the road. No doubt it 
would have a gas station and a 
place to get a hamburger and suds. 
Doug had taken off his peanut tank 
for this run, had fitted on a fat-bob 
still about three-quarters full. The 
same could not be said for his gut, 
which had a food -sized hole in it. 

After a half-hour of dodging 
potholes, cracks and craters along 
the ruined road, Doug’s arms were 
stiff with tension and his nerves 
definitely in need of a few cold 
beers. 

The countryside still seemed all 



136 



IF 




wrong. The fir trees were like 
nothing he had ever seen, like 
crude cartoons of the real thing. 
The ground beneath them crawled 
with giant purplish toadstools and 
raw-looking mushrooms the color 
of dried blood. As the sun sank to- 
ward the high ridgeline of the 
mountains, the clear sky took on an 
ugly steel-blue cast. Doug could 
hear the droning whine of insects 
even over the sound of the Harley’s 
exhaust. In a half-hour of riding 
through this unnatural landscape 
he had not spotted a single car or 
truck or bike. He did not like that 
one little bit. Only one thing kept 
him from brooding on the ominous 
strangeness of the world in which 
he found himself and on how the 
hell he had got there, and that was 
the total concentration needed to 
keep the scoot upright on this 
wreckage of a road. 

Finally, as the sun was starting to 
slide down behind the mountains, 
he crested a ridge and saw a huddle 
of buildings off to the right in the 
next valley. He caught a glimpse 
before the road curled down the 
slope of the hill. Trees screened the 
place from his sight until he 
reached the valley floor. There he 
found himself on the outskirts of 
the little burg. 

Or what was left of it. 

It could not have been much 
more than a wide spot in the road 
to begin with — a gas station next to 
a cafe, a few cinderblock stores, a 
couple of dozen wooden houses. 



But now it was a burned -out shell, 
a ruin. 

The houses were charred skele- 
tons. The store windows were 
shattered and it looked as if 
anything of value had long since 
been carried away. The front of the 
cafe had been ripped apart, appar- 
ently by an explosion; and the 
concrete was pitted with craters of 
the kind left by large-caliber am- 
munition. A few cars were scattered 
along the main drag — old rusted- 
out hulks, tires rotted away, glass 
smashed, body metal so thoroughly 
corroded that the colors of their 
paint jobs were unrecognizable. 

Doug pulled up beside one of the 
old wrecks and felt a sinking sensa- 
tion in his gut. It took him a mo- 
ment more to realize what it was 
about the hulk that shook him up. 

The car body had holes rusted 
right through it and when Doug 
punched the front door, the rotten 
metal crumbled. The whole body 
was a brittle shell of rust. Yet it was 
unmistakably the body of a Chevro- 
let Vega. Doug shuddered. GM 
had started building Vegas in 1971. 
And this wreck had to be at least 
ten years old. 

He had been asking the wrong 
question: not where the hell am I, 
but when? 

Doug could think of only one 
answer. 

Electricity, that son of a bitch, 
had really done him in this time! 
Somehow that lightning had kicked 
his tail into the future and, from 



EYE OF THE STORM 



137 




the look of this place, it was a 
future whose best days were past. 

Well, no point whining and 
sniveling about it. First order of 
business was to survive long enough 
to find people. He would play it by 
ear after that. 

In order to keep going he had to 
have food and gas. Three-quarters 
of a tank might or might not get 
him to more fuel, but it would be 
stupid to pass up the chance to 
drain the pumps of the ruined gas 
station. There must be some jerry 
cans around somewhere. 

He chugged over to the gas sta- 
tion and pulled up by the pumps. 
The station building was riddled 
with bulletholes and the whole 
place looked as if it had been 
stripped clean. Not a tool or a tire 
or a can of oil around, and nothing 
he could use to hold extra gas. 

Well, he had a quarter-empty 
tank and two one-quart canteens. 
Water figured to be a lot easier to 
come by than gas in the Rockies. 
He unscrewed his gas cap, plugged 
the nozzle of the nearest hoze ijito 
the hole and squeezed the grip. 

Nothing. The pump was bone 
dry. 

He tried every pump in the 
station with the same results. It 
figured. Gas would be a mighty 
precious commodity in an emer- 
gency and looters would not leave 
it sitting in pumps. And from the 
looks of this burg, it had been 
worked over by some mighty effi- 
cient looters. All right, so he would 



have to search and scramble pretty 
hard for gas, maybe appropriate 
some from citizens, if he could 
find any. Better start to look. He 
still had enough juice in his tank 
to take him well over a hundred 
miles. 

He remounted, started the en- 
gine, slipped into gear and began 
to roll. That was when he noticed 
the heap of bones just beyond the 
pumps. When he got a real close 
look, he broke into a cold sweat. 

T he bones were scattered around 
a burned-out fire. Some had 
been cracked open for the marrow 
and all were picked pretty clean. 
But swarms of ants were crawling 
all over them — including the two 
human skulls lying close to the 
fire. Their tops had been smashed 
in. 

Doug slammed the Harley up- 
gear and cranked on the throttle, 
shooting gravel as if the hounds of 
hell were after him. And from the 
looks of that bone pile, something 
even worse might show up at any 
moment. The sun was just about 
setting and this sure was no place to 
spend the night! 

He roared out of the gas station, 
really moving considering the con- 
dition of the surface. He zipped 
past a couple of gutted stores and a 
few gutted houses, and ghostville 
was behind him. 

The road bent to the right 
around a hillface. When Doug 
came out of the curve he saw his 



138 



IF 




way blocked by three of the shank- 
iest dudes on three of the most ri- 
diculous-looking bikes he had ever 
even heard of. 

Those scoots looked as though 
they had started as little 125cc 
Hondas or something similar. They 
were not chopped at all but every 
scrap of non-essential metal had 
been removed from the frames, 
making them look almost like bi- 
cycles. They mounted knobby tires 
front and rear and outrageously 
oversized gas tanks. But the craz- 
iest things about them were the 
outriggers that sprouted on both 
sides behind the single bicycle-type 
seats. Lengths of pipe about three 
feet long were pivot- mounted on 
frame-members, the play restricted 
both up and down by sets of springs 
that might have been scavenged 
from the forks of mopeds. At the 
ends of these lengths of pipe, 
mounted on bicycle forks, each out- 
rigger had a fat-tired little wheel off 
a kid’s trail bike. When the scoots 
were moving in an upright position, 
the outrigger wheels would ride 
about a foot off the ground. Now, 
at rest, the left outrigger wheels 
were on the ground, doubling as 
instant stands. The bikes were the 
second ugliest and the second 
weirdest things Doug Allard had 
ever seen. 

The ugliest and weirdest things 
he had ever seen were the three 
creeps riding them. 

They looked like a cross between 
basketball centers who had not 



eaten for a month and giant grass- 
hoppers — about seven feet tall, thin 
as skeletons. They had long awk- 
ward arms and legs that made them 
seem to be perching on their 
spindly little scoots like praying 
mantises. They wore greasy leather 
pants, black sleeveless vests and 
long scabbards at their belts. In the 
deep shadows of the setting sun 
their hairless skin seemed to glisten 
a pale waxy green. 

But it was their faces that made 
Doug reach behind him and uncoil 
the length of chain he kept 
wrapped around a frame-member. 
He brought up the Harley to about 
ten feet from the things. They were 
as bald as green apples and they 
had weak little chins under practi- 
cally lipless mouths that hung open 
stupidly, showing rows of long 
yellow teeth. Their eyes were 
lunatic and bloodshot, sunk deep 
in sockets under apelike hairless 
brows. They did not much look like 
folks you could trust. 

Doug let the three-foot length of 
chain dangle from his left hand, 
clanging loudly against the frame 
of the Harley as it snaked to the 
ground. “I’d appreciate it if you 
boys would clear the road,” he 
said. “You’d appreciate it too.” 

The creep in the middle sniffed 
the air. “Gas!” he hissed. “I smell 
much gas in the strange machine!” 

“And much meat on the bones of 
this white one!” 

“We were right to come up into 
the thin air of the mountains. Here 



EYE OF THE STORM 



139 




there are still many of the fat, juicy 
white ones. It’s this strange pale 
air. They choke in the lowlands, 
but here they become rich morsels 
of succulent meat!” 

“Let us feast!” 

They laughed shrilly and drew 
long sharp swords. 

“You named it, mothers!” Doug 
shouted as the three spindly bikes 
came wobbling toward him like 
awkward insects, their gawky riders 
having some trouble steering and 
trying to hold onto their swords at 
the same time. He shifted into first, 
gave her a little throttle and veered 
off to the right, so that the green 
creep on the left closed with him 
about two feet from his chain hand, 
thrusting clumsily with his sword. 

Doug whipped the chain through 
the air and caught him squarely 
across the back of the skull as the 
outrigger buzzed by. The thing’s 
head burst like a rotten water- 
melon, spewing thin splinters of 
bone and gray-green slime. The 
out-of-control bike slammed into 
the scoot next to it — the big geek 
riding it moved in quick spastic 
jerks as he tried in vain to avoid the 
collision and was knocked sprawl- 
ing to the ground. 

Doug was past them now and his 
hog could surely outrun their silly 
machines, but his blood was boiling 
and he figured the proper thing to 
do was finish the job. These creeps 
were lame pushovers — finishing off 
the two remaining should not even 
raise a decent sweat. 



H e whipped his chop around, 
came back at the one on the 
ground, who seemed to be having 
trouble getting to his feet. As Doug 
passed, bringing the chain down 
across the creature’s back, the 
other managed — with a mantis-like 
twitch — to slash Doug harmlessly 
on his boot. By the time Doug had 
turned his bike again for another 
pass the greenie was scrambling 
shakily to his feet. Eyes rolling, 
teeth bared, mouth drooling, he 
stood woozily slashing his sword 
through the air as Doug bore down 
on him. 

At the last moment Doug veered 
slightly to the right, ducked under 
the whistling sword and caught him 
across the kneecaps with the chain. 
The greenie screamed, buckled and 
fell on his face. 

Doug saw that the last outrigger 
bike was hightailing it up the road 
away from him. The cowardly bas- 
tard was running out on his part- 
ners! 

“That won’t do you any good, 
you son of a bitch!” he shouted as 
he cranked throttle in pursuit. Bdy, 
that crud had to be really stupid to 
think he could outrun a Harley on a 
runty little bike like that! 

It was getting dark, so Doug 
turned on his headlight as he 
chased the greenie over the tortu- 
ous road. About thirty yards ahead, 
the spindly little outrigger bike with 
its skeletonlike rider wobbled and 
bounced crazily in Doug’s high 
beam like a lurching spider. 



140 




The geek on the outrigger seem- 
ed a piss-poor rider, hitting half the 
potholes and rocks in the road, as if 
he had the reflexes of somebody’s 
grandfather. Doug saw what those 
outrigger wheels were for as now 
the left, now the right touched 
ground for a moment as the bike 
hit a pothole or a rock and heeled 
over suddenly. They were like the 
training wheels on a little kid’s first 
bicycle; without them, the incom- 
petent slob on the machine would 
have gone down every couple of 
minutes on a killer road like this 
one. 

In fact it took all of Doug’s skill, 
reflexes and arm-strength to keep 
from going down himself on the so- 
called road. 

He had been chasing the out-rig- 
ger for maybe five minutes, he rea- 
lized, without gaining any ground. 
Imagine, a 125cc mouse of a bike 
holding its own against a high-ball- 
ing chopper! But forty or at the 
most forty-five was as fast as Doug 
could go on this torture-track road- 
way without creaming himself out. 
At that speed, the outrigger bike 
was probably going flat out while 
he still had more than half his 
throttle left. A lot of good that did 
him! 

He conceded now that, crazy as it 
looked, the outrigger bike design 
made some sense. Road condition 
imposed forty-five as top speed any- 
way, so all his big engine did for 
him was use up more gas per mile. 
That son of a bitch up there could 



pace him all night, and guess who 
would run out of gas first! 

It really burned Doug to think of 
that creep outrunning his big scoot 
on that little bug of his! Man, what 
would the Avengers say if he ever 
got to see their beautiful ugly faces 
again? The jaw-action would be 
murder . 

Up ahead, the outrigger bike dis- 
appeared for a moment around a 
righthand curve. 

Suddenly Doug heard a high- 
pitched roar, shouts from more or 
less human throats, a long shrill 
scream. Then the outrigger bike 
reappeared, weaving drunkenly all 
over the road in his general direc- 
tion. The rider was missing his left 
arm, and quarts of green goo were 
gushing out of the stump. The 
outrigger slid off the road entirely 
and shattered against a tree, send- 
ing the dying rider flying off into 
the underbrush. 

And then, rushing straight at 
him, Doug saw the headlights of 
perhaps a dozen motorcycles. An 
instant later, he made them out 
sharp and clear. Outrigger bikes, 
each ridden by one of the tall green 
skeletons, eyes glowing and swords 
flashing in the gleam of the head- 
lights. 

Doug had no time to do heavy 
thinking. He cranked on all the 
throttle he had, hunched his body 
as low over the tank as he could, 
prayed he would not hit a hole or a 
rock in the next thirty feet, and 
tried to steer for the empty spaces 



EYE OF THE STORM 



141 




in the crowd of devil-bikes bearing 
down on him. 

Still accelerating, he zipped be- 
tween two bikes, taking an out- 
rigger wheel on his left thigh as 
sharp steel passed over his head. 
His front wheel caught in a crack in 
the road. He felt his rear wheel go- 
ing out as he fought for control. He 
skidded sideways a foot or two, 
glancing off the front tire of an out- 
rigger bike, but regained control as 
the outrigger bounced into the bike 
next to it. Doug ducked another 
sword stroke that was way off the 
mark, and then he was through, 
hauling ass up the dark winding 
road while all was confusion and 
shouting behind him. 

D oug felt as if he had been riding 
for days. Yet it could not have 
been more than an hour or two 
since his escape from the freaks. 
Ahead of him everything was inky 
black except for the cone his 
headlamp cut out of the darkness. 
The road, as full of cracks and pot- 
holes as ever, climbed higher into 
the Rockies. It was all Doug could 
do to keep his scoot upright at 40. 
Both arms ached from the prolong- 
ed effort and tension, and his left 
leg hurt like hell where the out- 
rigger wheel had caught it. He was 
starting to see things that weren’t 
there and not see things that were. 
A couple of times he started to lean 
into left turns that were really 
rights, as the trees and the bounc- 
ing beam of the headlight played 



tricks on his eyes. He longed to 
stop, if only to take five. 

But all he had to do was glance 
back over his shoulder and see 
those massed headlights about two 
hundred yards behind to know that 
a five-minute rest would be his last. 
Two hundred yards. He had open- 
ed up the gap in the confusion of 
his dash through them, and he had 
not been able to gain on them 
since. Well, at least they had not 
been able to close on him. 

It was the damnedest bike race in 
history, Doug was sure. A couple of 
miles of straight road, or even a few 
miles of decently paved bends, and 
his big chop would leave the 
mothers in the dust. But on this 
cow-track it did not matter that he 
had three times the bike they did, 
that he was three times the rider 
they were. With all his power and 
skill, all he could average was 
about forty, and those little mickey 
mouse machines just buzzed along 
flat out, flopping around on their 
outriggers, matching his speed on 
half the gas consumption. 

And that was what really scared 
him. 

With those king-sized tanks and 
pint-sized engines, the freaks had 
at least twice his range. Unless they 
had started the chase more than 
half empty, he would run out of gas 
first. Then what? It would be his 
chain against eleven or twelve 
swords. Four or five of the mothers 
would not have scared him, but 
eleven? They would stick him. They 



142 



IF 




would suck the marrow from his 
bones and eat the brains out of his 
skull. 

Doug took another glance be- 
hind. As he did, a bolt of lightning 
lit up the scene like a strobe. 

Down in the hollow behind him, 
he saw the outrigger bikes hopping 
and jouncing in pursuit like army 
ants, the flesh of their mantis-like 
riders gleaming with a sickly green 
wetness. 

Darkness and a roll of thunder, 
then another flash of lightning. 

Oh, no! Not another electrical 
storm. And as he thought it, three 
quick sheets of lightning ripped 
across the sky one after the other, 
as if electricity, his old enemy, had 
shown up to gloat over his predica- 
ment. A long, slow rumble of thun- 
der shook his guts. 

“Not yet, you mother, not yet!” 
he shouted at the sky. 

Feeling fury surge through him, 
he cranked on more throttle. 
Thereupon he hit a little rock, slid 
askew, and had to use his painful 
left leg to keep from going down. 
He winced, cursed, and saw that 
the slip had cost him a few yards of 
his lead. Lightning touched a ridge 
off to his right. 

And his engine broke up for a 
few beats. 

Another bolt of lightning hit off 
to his left, closer. Again his engine 
coughed and hesitated. Man, all he 
had to do was stall out now! He saw 
that he had lost another yard or 
two. 



Slam ! Bang! He was bracketed 
on both sides by lightning, deafen- 
ed by the thunder. The chop’s en- 
gine coughed, sputtered. 

And died. 

He could hear the scream of 
those flat-out little engines coming 
up behind him like a swarm of 
giant wasps. Howling wordlessly, 
he craned his neck around to see 
the green demons on their outrig- 
gers outlined — ten yards behind — 
by another flash of lightning. Fran- 
tically he tromped down on the 
starter with all his might. The 
engine caught. He slammed the 
chopper into gear and cranked it 
on. 

He opened up the gap to twenty 
yards before a crack in the road 
threw him into a skid. Slide 
slippage lost back the distance he 
had gained. 

He crested a hill, went roaring 
down into a narrow valley. He 
leaned into a mild left curve with 
the devil bikes still thirty feet be- 
hind him and lightning cracking 
through the air all around him. His 
engine broke up again, coughed, 
almost died, but recaught. The 
green creeps gained another few 
feet during the hesitation. They 
were so close that he could hear the 
blood-curdling cries coming from 
their throats as they sensed the kill. 

Another bolt of lightning, an- 
other cough from his engine. 

A sword whistled over Doug’s 
head, burying its point three inches 
deep in a tree beside the road. A 



EYE OF THE STORM 



143 




second sword glanced off his sissy- 
bar, looped high in the air, just 
missed his back on the way down. 
A third sword sent a thin sting 
through his left shoulder as it sliced 
through his colors. 

Doug Allard knew he had had it. 
He was beyond fear, beyond de- 
spair, beyond knowing what the 
hell he was doing except on an in- 
stinctual level. He was all rage — 
rage at the monstrosities that would 
be eating his flesh in a few more 
minutes, rage at the sparky dragon 
in the sky that had thrown him into 
this hell-world in the first place. 

Lightning blinded him as one 
more sword whistled past his head. 
In one final, defiant gesture, he 
ripped the headlight wire loose, 
and held the naked end aloft 
shouting at the sky: “Come and get 
me, you yellow mother! I dare you! 
I d~” 

The world turned that blinding, 
crazy yellow. Everything seemed to 
happen at once and in slow motion. 
His body tingled, he choked on 
ozone, and the engine quit entirely. 
The chop started to fall but he 
knew that if he went down in that 
instant or even allowed his foot to 
touch the road he would have had 
it. Standing up on the pegs, still 
blinded, he threw his body to the 
right as hard as he could against 
the bank of the turn, compensating 
for the sudden drop in speed. The 
Harley wobbled insanely. Thunder 
walloped his eardrums but his 
vision began to clear. 



He saw dimly that he was careen- 
ing across the road, thumping and 
bouncing toward a steep drop into 
a thickly wooded gully to the right. 
He downshifted, slammed on the 
brakes. Forward momentum was 
killed and the scoot gently slid out 
from under him. He rolled away 
from the bike, losing a certain 
amount of skin in the process. 



K icking himself off the ground, 
he saw that the Harley was lying 
on its side in the tall grass by the 
side of the road about three yards 
from having rolled into a rugged- 
looking little canyon. It was day- 
light, the trees were ordinary fir 
trees, the road was in good repair, 
there were no green demons on out- 
rigger bikes coming up it, and the 
electrical storm was retreating 
across the sky to the east. 

Slowly, it got through to him. He 
was at the very place where he had 
been hit by lightning the first time, 
and at about the same hour of day 
too, by the look of the sky. None of 
that crazy stuff had really happen- 
ed. The lightning must have knock- 
ed him out of his head for a few 
‘minutes and into an electricity 
nightmare. 

Only then did he note the thin 
pain in his left shoulder, the slash 
in his colors, the blood underneath. 

When he checked out the bike, 
he found the headlight wire hang- 
ing loose and a wad of tinfoil in the 
fuse-clip. •

IF 





T IHE street was long and straight. 

Glancing down it quickly, a dis- 
interested observer would see two 
lines of terraced houses, dirty cars 
parked on each side of the roadway 
and would experience an over- 
whelming sense of gray decay. The 
street was like many others on this 
side of the city: drab, barren, im- 
parting a feeling of timelessness. A 
battle might be fought a hundred 
yards away and still the street 
would reflect no change. 

Trees had been planted on each 
side of the street a century before. 
Now they were nearly all dead, 
spreading up from the sidewalk to 
lift stiff, leafless branches toward 
the gray sky. 



Only in one place did the trees 
still show greenery and that was 
where two of them grew close 
together on one side of the street. 
Each bore a full complement of 
leaves, a discordancy of natural 
color untinged by city dirt. In con- 
trast with the others, these two still 
waved supple branches in the 
breeze. 

Beneath the two green trees were 
parked three cars. Each one was in 
showroom condition, its paint un- 
scratched, its windows clean, and 
its tires still black and with mold 
marks on the tread. Other cars in 
the street were not in such finely 
preserved state. Even those next to 
the three were covered in the 



145 




humus of the leaves of last year’s 
autumn. Farther down the street 
others squatted half on and half off 
the sidewalk, fenders broken, 
wheelcovers missing, bodies rusted 
and glassless remnants. Finely 
shattered windshield fragments 
made walking treacherous. 

The houses in the street were 
empty and dilapidated, looking like 
an abandoned movie set. Only the 
hou$e by the new cars and the two 
green trees showed any signs of 
habitation. It was the house of 
Arthur Knowland and he stood 
now at the open door, looking out 
at the cars. He was a tall man in his 
late fifties, stooping slightly and 
wearing old, shapeless clothes. 

The net curtaining at the windows 
of his house was clean and freshly 
pressed. On one of the sills stood a 
row of six porcelain pots containing 
cacti. In another window a hyacinth 
bulb sat on top of a conical glass 
bottle, tiny tendrils of white root 
just starting to reach down to the 
surface of the water an inch below. 
Next to it a dark-green vase was 
fashioned in the shape of a gro- 
tesque fish, bent in the middle so 
its tail touched its open mouth. The 
architecture of the house was very 
old and the light trickling in 
through the window panes behind 
Knowland was scant. 



K nowland put his hand in his 
trousers pocket to check that 
he had his front-door key. He 



looked at the sky to make sure it 
wouldn’t rain, saw that the clouds 
were a featureless gray and were 
covering the entire sky, then closed 
the door behind him with slow, 
precise movements. 

He walked down the tiny path- 
way to the gate. 

In his garden, nothing grew. 
Arthur Knowland favored it with 
less than a glance as he passed 
through. 

He opened the gate and walked 
out into the street, glancing up at 
the trees and admiring their green- 
ery. Such trees! It was comforting 
to him that they should continue to 
grow here. It was a part of his daily 
routine to make the observation. 

After a moment’s pause he 
walked on, past the line of cars and 
down the street toward the intersec- 
tion. As he walked his interest in 
his surroundings dwindled sharply 
and he slipped back into the reverie 
which of late had occupied virtually 
the whole of his waking moments. 
But as he approached the intersec- 
tion a man came around the corner 
from the right and walked up to 
him. 

Knowland said, “Ah, Mr. Ridg- 
way. Good afternoon fo you.” 

Ridgway opened his mouth and 
started to speak. For an instant no 
sound could be heard. 

Then: “Good afternoon, Mr. 
Knowland. Fine day, is it not?’’ . 

Knowland stared. The man’s 
speech was out of synchronization 
with the movements of his mouth. 

IF 



146 




The last three words were still being 
spoken as he closed his mouth and 
smiled. 

“Er — I beg your pardon?” Know- 
land said, a trifle confused. He 
shook his head and concentrated 
harder. 

“I said I thought it was a fine 
day,” Ridgway repeated, his voice 
now firmly synchronized with his 
lips, but too loud. Far too loud. 

“Yes. Yes, of course,” Know- 
land said. “I’m sorry. I thought I 
misheard.” 

He glanced at the sky, noted that 
it was still its oppressive gray and 
wondered what was fine about the 
weather. Although the day was far 
from cold or otherwise unpleasant, 
this was not his conception of fine 
weather. Not that he cared unduly. 
For a moment he thought he 
caught a glimpse of the sun break- 
ing through the grayness but 
nothing happened. 

Ridgway smiled again. 

“Ah, well,” he said. “On my 
way. See you tomorrow, Mr. Know- 
land.” 

His voice was at normal volume 
again and everything was as it 
should be. 

Knowland nodded and walked 
on. 

Had he made a mistake about 
the man’s lips? Where, he suddenly 
wondered, did Ridgway live? He 
stopped short again. This was the 
first time, Knowland realized, that 
he had ever thought to ask himself 
that. The man had to live some- 



where around here — Knowland al- 
ways seemed to meet him at the 
same intersection. 

He looked around at the houses 
and knew that Ridgway could not 
live here. Every place was derelict. 
Doors were hanging from hinges. 
Windows were smashed or frame- 
less. Chimney stacks had fallen into 
the tileless roofs. Yet everywhere 
was like this. The man must live 
somewhere. 

Perhaps in one of the less 
decayed buildings . 

Knowland looked around again 
until he saw a house which, al- 
though uninhabitable by normal 
standards, at least had its roof in- 
tact. 

As he studied it he wondered why 
he had not noticed it before. Al- 
though the brickwork was as dirty 
as on all the houses, the front door 
was still whole and none of the win- 
dows was broken. He took half a 
step toward the place, then paused. 
Something was wrong. 

He could not remember having 
ever before studied each house indi- 
vidually, but he had been certain 
that all of them here- were in the 
same state of abandonment. He 
hadn’t given this street more than a 
sideways glance for days but noth- 
ing had ever changed here. 

Undeniably, however, this one 
house was now intact. 

He stepped of the curb, walked 
across the narrow street and looked 
closely. Now he could see that the 
glass in the windows was not only 

147 



TRANSPLANT 




whole, but dean, too. And inside — 
curtains! 

Drab curtains, crumpled maybe. 
But a sign that this house now was 
occupied or recently had been. He 
glanced at the door and saw that 
the brass handle was smooth, as if 
it had been often used. 

A mild kind of excitement mount- 
ing in him, Knowland grasped the 
metal fence and stood on tiptoe, 
trying to see into the front rooms. 

Could this be Ridgway’s house? 

Sharp doubt struck him. The 
man always came from the opposite 
direction, from the road down 
which Knowland would walk to 
Veronica’s old house. He’d never 
seen Ridgway at any other time or 
in any other place. If he did live in 
this house, it was strange that 
Knowland had not seen him walk- 
ing past his window. Knowland 
spent most of his time in the front 
room, looking out at the two trees 
and three cars that stood outside 
his house. If people passed — par- 
ticularly Ridgway whom he knew 
by sight and name — he would see 
them. 

Even as he looked at the house, 
more of it came to his attention. 
The paint seemed brighter than 
when he’d first looked at it, the 
rubble in the tiny front garden less 
untidily scattered among the weeds. 
The railings he gripped felt no 
longer brittle and rusty, but as if 
they had been regularly painted to 
preserve them from the ravages of 
the atmosphere. 



But no one lived here ... no one. 

Not Ridgway, or anyone else. 
Knowland was totally alone. It was 
self-indulgent fantasy even to imag- 
ine anyone lived in this house. 

His fingers loosened from around 
the rail and he walked away from 
the place. He was only a few yards 
from the intersection and he crossed 
back to the other side. 

He glanced at his watch. Already 
he was beginning to feel a little 
tired. If he walked around the 
block, past Veronica’s old house 
and back to his own, he would have 
enough time to make himself some 
tea before going to bed. Was it 
already growing dark? He looked at 
the sky and saw as he’d suspected 
that the clouds were lowering. 

He stepped out a little faster, 
striding down the side street toward 
Veronica’s. 

Behind him the house he had 
been looking at began to settle. 
First the paint darkened, taking on 
its customary coat of atmospheric 
grime. Then the weeds grew thicker 
in the tiny front garden and the 
rubble of bricks, old bottles and 
pieces of peeled-off stucco heaped 
together untidily. The front door 
swung on its upper hinge so that 
the base of the door fell into the 
hallway, revealing a dark corridor 
lined with brown, peeling wall- 
paper. A crack appeared at the 
bottom of the main window, crept 
upward across the glass, then down 
again sharply. The window fell in- 
ward and smashed. One tile skidded 



148 



IF 




down the angled roof and crashed 
into the overgrown garden, quickly 
followed by several more. 

Two hundred yards away Know- 
land heard the sound of breaking 
tile and glass as a whisper on the 
breeze. 

And ignored it. 

D r. william samuelson sat in 
his swivel chair at the window 
of his office, looking down at the 
crowded hospital parking lot twelve 
stories below. He was deep in 
thought. 

Nurse Donalds knocked at the 
door and stepped in. She stood by 
the open door and waited patiently 
for the doctor to turn. He did at 
last, a concerned frown across his 
forehead. 

“I have a Mr. Wylatt to see you,” 
the nurse said. “He says he has an 
appointment, though I have no 
record of it in — ” 

“No. That’s all right. Show him 
in. He telephoned this morning.” 
“Yes, Doctor.” 

She backed out and Samuelson 
heard her say: “The Doctor will see 
you now.” A few seconds later 
Wylatt came in and closed the door 
behind him. He walked over to the 
doctor and extended his right hand. 

‘‘Good morning, Doctor. It’s 
good of you to see me — ” 

“Not at all.” Samuelson waved 
the man into a seat. 

Wylatt continued speaking as if 
Samuelson had not responded to 
his first utterance: “ — the TDPS is 



anxious to remain on pleasant rela- 
tions with the medical profession 
and you must consider my visit to- 
day as most informal. I’m sure you 
will understand. Now I wonder — ” 

Samuelson said, “Cigarette, Mr. 
Wylatt?” Normally he discouraged 
smoking, but he pushed an open 
box toward the man, effectively 
cutting off the flow. Wylatt took a 
cigarette and lit it. 

“Now what is it The Donors’ Pro- 
tection Society wants from me?” 
Samuelson asked carefully. 

Wylatt took a deep breath and 
opened his mouth. 

“Is it about our latest patient?” 
Samuelson said quickly. 

“Yes, Doctor.” 

“I thought it might be. Well, go 
ahead.” 

Wylatt said, “The TDPS is rep- 
resenting the next of kin of Michael 
Arnson, as I expect you had antici- 
pated.” 

Samuelson nodded gravely. 

“That’s the first part of my mis- 
sion today,” Wylatt went on. “But 
I have also been approached by a 
Mrs. Knowland who, having no one 
to turn to — in her own words, Doc- 
tor — has come to us. Mrs. Know- 
land was in a state of near-despera- 
tion when I saw her this morning, 
which you can imagine was — ” 

“I saw her last week. She was 
quite upset.” 

“Ah — yes. Well, Mrs. Knowland 
is herself a member of the TDPS, 
and she thought we could help her 
in some way.” 



TRANSPLANT 



149 




Samuelson watched the other 
man steadily. This was not his first 
encounter with the TDPS — a chari- 
table organization that had the aim 
of protecting its members from irre- 
sponsible and unnecessary donation 
of their organs in the event of severe 
accident — but this could easily be 
his most potentially hazardous. 
The society had no backing in law, 
which now stated firmly that once 
clinical death had been established, 
organ transplantation could legally 
take place. Nevertheless, the organ- 
ization was gaining great support, 
and could not be ignored. 

This case, involving the pathetic- 
ally ill Arthur Knowland, could de- 
velop into a trial by press, with the 
whole future of medical organ 
transplants at stake. 

“Did you conduct the operation 
yourself. Doctor Samuelson?” 

“No. But the case had my per- 
sonal written sanction, and I ob- 
served the operation from the gal- 
lery. The surgeon was Doctor 
Jennser — the ablest heart specialist 
in the country. There is no question 
that the operation should have 
taken place.” 

“No, of course not,” Wylatt in- 
terjected quickly, as if afraid he 
had offered an impertinence. “I’m 
sure the condition of the sick man, 
or the skill of the medical staff in- 
volved, were never in doubt.” 

“Well, please state your case, 
Mr. Wylatt. I’m confident of your 
sincerity, but I am exceptionally 
busy at the moment.” 



W ylatt had a flat black valise 
on his knee. He opened it. 
“My case, as you put it, is more 
or less what you have doubtless an- 
ticipated. Michael Arnson, a mem- 
ber of ours, had a vital organ, to wit 
his heart, removed from his body 
against his own wishes as clearly 
stated in the testamentary docu- 
ment he lodged with the society. I 
have a photostat of it here.” 

He passed it across to Samuel- 
son. 

“Under the charter of the society 
this constitutes a trespass of person 
and a breach of private rights. An- 
other member of our group, Mrs. 
Veronica Knowland, has also com- 
plained to the society regarding the 
medical treatment given to her late 
husband at the time of his opera- 
tion.” 

Dr. Samuelson looked quite care- 
fully at the photostated document 
in front of him, though he had seen 
its like before. It was a signed — by 
Michael Arnson — and witnessed 
declaration regarding the disposal 
of bodily remains. Specific organs 
were listed as being the private 
property of the undersigned: heart, 
kidneys, lungs, liver, eye-corneas, 
stomach, certain glands and other 
minor functional organs of the 
body. These were to be disposed of, 
together with the whole corpse, by 
cremation upon death. 

“You appreciate, Mr. Wylatt, 
that the medical profession does 
not recognize this?” 

“So we gather. But we have 



150 



IF 




grounds to believe that were it to be 
tested in a court of law it would be 
upheld. We understand that it is 
legal as a testamentary document. 
We took counsel several years ago.” 
‘‘I’m sure you did,” Samuelson 
said. ‘‘And yet it hasn’t been tested 
to date?” 

‘‘No. But—” 

‘‘How well acquainted are you, 
Mr. Wylatt, with the facts of this 
case?” 

The other man shrugged. “I 
know what was reported in the 
newspapers. And I have spoken 
with Arnson’s mother and Mrs. 
Knowland.” 

“So you know the full outcome of 
the operation?” 

“Yes.” 

S amuelson swiveled around in 
his chair so that he faced the 
window. 

“But I’m afraid you don’t. More 
is involved than superficial factors. 
And I think before we proceed with 
the claims of your society I should 
explain them to you.” 

He turned back to his desk and 
opened a slim manila file. 

“Michael Arnson was admitted 
to this hospital fourteen days ago, 
after having been involved in a 
motor accident. I won’t detail the 
specific injuries he suffered, but 
there was extensive breakage of his 
ribs, his shoulders and his skull. 
We suspected massive brain dam- 
age on first inspection and under 
surgery this was confirmed. When 



he first arrived at the hospital Arn- 
son was still breathing and his 
heart was beating. 

“It took several hours to contact 
his mother — whose address, inci- 
dentally, we got from the card 
issued to Arnson by your society — 
and he died before we could get in 
touch with her.” 

Wylatt opened his mouth to say 
something, but the doctor waved 
him to silence. 

“I know you contest our defini- 
tion of death, but I think we have 
no need to discuss that here and 
now. Suffice it to say that by our 
standard clinical procedure, when 
we could detect no measurable ac- 
tivity from the brain — and the pa- 
tient stopped breathing — we con- 
sidered him to be dead. 

“During this time a patient in 
our coronary ward, Arthur Know- 
land, was in the last stages of a long 
and painful heart disease. Arnson’s 
blood group was acceptably close to 
Knowland’s and we decided to ef- 
fect an immediate transplant. If it 
were successful we knew we could 
promise Knowland a return to 
normal life.” 

Wylatt said, “But he didn’t 
receive Arnson’s heart. Knowland 
never recovered.” 

Samuelson stared at him. “So 
this outcome, by your code of 
ethics, denies our right to attempt 
it?” 

“Yes.” 

“Maybe. But in this instance 
there was more involved. Forget the 



transplant 



151 




ethics for a moment — one man’s 
life was certainly over, another’s 
was equally certainly doomed with- 
out an efficient heart. We went 
ahead anyway and removed Know- 
land’s old heart. As is standard 
procedure, during the interim a 
heart-lung machine controlled his 
blood circulation while the donor’s 
heart was prepared. This time — ” 
Wylatt’s eyebrows rose. “The 
operation failed?” 

“No. It was successfully removed. 
And the transplant would, we are 
certain, have been a successful one. 
But we were unable to place it in 
Knowland’s body for the reason 
that Arnson’s heart was equally 
diseased. We discovered a malig- 
nant tumor on the upper ventricle 
wall. 

“Arnson had cancer. There was 
nothing we could do.” 

K nowland walked on down the 
side street, aware that this was 
neutral territory. He carried in his 
mind a clear concept of the arrange- 
ment of the streets and knew, 
almost to the last foot, the precise 
distance he had to walk to the next 
intersection. 

His own street ran roughly east- 
west, with the main shopping street 
at the eastern end. The intersection 
where he normally met Ridgway 
was about a mile from the shops 
and his house was about three- 
quarters of that distance along it. 
The street he was walking now 
paralleled the main street and was 



less than a quarter mile in length. 

On each side of the street ran a 
dark brick wall of medium height. 
Although it was just above the level 
of his head, Knowland knew that if 
he could somehow raise himself to 
peer over it, he would see the over- 
grown gardens at the backs of the 
derelict houses. But he had no in- 
terest in these and always kept his 
head hunched down jnto his shoul- 
ders along this stretch of his daily 
walk. 

The encounter with Ridgway had 
disturbed him in a way he did not 
care to consider. Did he control in 
some fashion his experience? 

There had been that earlier 
puzzle of his heart. 

Awakening one morning, he had 
found himself panting for breath, 
as often happened. But before he 
could reach for his pills he had felt 
an overriding compulsion to believe 
the pain was habitual rather than 
actual. He had winced at the agony 
in his chest, but had known in the 
same instant that it could be psy- 
chosomatic. The doctors had once 
even treated him for that kind of 
disorder. The memory had helped — 
and he had concentrated on banish- 
ing the pain. 

In seconds his breathing had 
steadied. In minutes his heart was 
an almost imperceptible movement 
in his- chest. 

And in days he had virtually for- 
gotten what it was like to live in 
constant pain and fear. 

He reached the second intersec- 



152 



IF 




tion and turned to the right again. 
This street, like his own, led down 
to the shopping street a mile or so 
away. He walked on, hardly seeing 
the houses around him. Houses like 
those he lived among, with gaping 
doors and windows, crumbling 
staircases and vacant, tileless roofs. 
The whole environment of this 
place was a depressant to him. He 
wondered sometimes why he con- 
tinued his walks, but the long habit 
of years was difficult to break. 

After about ten minutes he came 
to Veronica’s house — or at least the 
house that Veronica had lived in 
with her parents years ago, before 
he’d married her. He stared at it for 
several minutes, seeing the old- 
fashioned wallpaper and curtains. 
The door was painted a drab, dirty 
maroon, as he had always known it. 

And the house was empty as he 
had known it would be and it would 
stay that way. He walked on. 

He came to the main street and 
braced himself against its impact as 
he turned the corner. Here the side- 
walks were crowded with people, 
milling slowly from store to store. 
Each window was brightly lit, its 
wares a garish blend of colored 
packaging and lighting. The street 
traffic roared by endlessly in both 
directions. It seemed darker now 
and the sidewalk was wet. The light 
from the shop windows was reflect- 
ed in the street and the lights on the 
passing cars and trucks dazzled 
him. This was the part of his walk 
that he liked the least and he 



hurried now, his head bent down as 
if in defense against the onslaught 
of the noise and movement. Voices 
echoed around him, seeming to be 
without source or direction. Word- 
less sounds that made little sense, 
they added no comfort to his feel- 
ings. He collided several times with 
people — drab women loaded down 
with heavy baskets, tall men who 
hurried past without apology. 

He reached the corner of his own 
street and turned into it gratefully. 
Silence fell abruptly. 

The sky was darkening steadily 
and he maintained his hurried 
pace. His street had no lamps and 
in the night became a black canyon 
of fear. His walk had tired him and 
the thought of sleep was a pleasant 
one. An early night, he thought. I 
get tired so easily. If Veronica were 
here she would understand. 

He reached his house and went 
inside. He warmed some milk, 
drank it, got undressed and went to 
bed. He slept lightly, often waking 
to lie trembling in the black silence 
of the night and think of his wife. 

When he awoke in the morning 
Veronica lay next to him and she 
was laughing. 

D r. william samuels on and 
his visitor from the TDPS 
stood ^together in silence, as the lift 
descended slowly. Finally it stopped 
on the second floor and the hydrau- 
lic doors opened. Samuelson led 
the way down a long corridor. 

“It’s best for you to see Know- 



TRANSPLANT 



153 




land yourself,” he said. “I think 
you’ll appreciate our problem when 
you have seen him.” 

Wylatt said, “But the fact of 
Amson’s other illness doesn’t alter 
the moral position, Doctor. His 
body was violated against his will.” 

Samuelson gestured impatiently. 
“Under normal circumstances, Mr. 
Wylatt, I would have difficulty in 
maintaining the position of the pro- 
fession in this kind of dispute. We 
all have our personal feelings and I 
tend to the liberal view myself. But 
in spite of this, I think you’ll agree 
that in this instance there is a lack 
of precedent.” 

“Maybe, maybe. But one must 
always consider principles. I refuse 
to abandon mine and those of my 
society.” 

“Of course.” 

They walked on in silence. 

The hospital was quiet. They 
passed several boards pointing to- 
ward various surgical units and 
wards, all of which appeared to be 
in other parts of the hospital. 

By way of explanation, Samuel- 
son said, “This is our convalescent 
and therapeutic wing. Knowland 
was brought here after the opera- 
tion because of the fatal ease with 
which a delicate process can be dis- 
rupted in a busy hospital. We have 
had to set aside a whole suite to 
maintain the sterile conditions we 
need.” 

Wylatt nodded. 

They came eventually to a pair of 
swing doors and Samuelson walked 



through holding the door open for 
the other man. A nurse on the other 
side stood up when she saw the 
doctor. She led them into a room 
adjacent to her tiny office. 

Samuelson said. “Thank you, 
Amy.” 

She went out again, leaving the 
two men alone. 

The room was fairly small and 
contained three rows of wooden 
seats. In the wall opposite these was 
a large window, looking into the 
next room. Samuelson sat down in 
one of the seats and motioned 
Wylatt to sit next to him. He 
pointed toward the window. 

“That’s Knowland there,” he 
said. 

The next room was brightly lit. 
Its walls were white and in the ceil- 
ing a battery of lamps poured down 
a startling brilliance. In the center 
of the room stood a high, padded 
table, on which lay the body of a 
man. He was dressed in a feature- 
less smock that covered his legs, 
chest and arms. On his head was a 
white cloth that lay over his fore- 
head. His face was bare and his 
eyes were closed. 

By the side of the table an array 
of complicated machinery made a 
confusion of shining brass, black 
rubber and gleaming strands of 
copper wire. Two white-coated, 
white-masked men stood by the 
bed. One held a board in his hand 
and transferred to it readings from 
a row of dials on the machine. The 
other stood back, carefully watch- 



154 



IF 




ing the registrations on a slowly 
moving electroencephalograph. 

Wylatt took in the scene for 
several seconds. 

“But I thought Knowland was 
dead.” 

“He is,” Samuelson replied. 
“Knowland is what we call ‘discor- 
poreally dead.’” 

Wylatt said, “I don’t see that 
there is any subtlety about the defi- 
nition of death.” 

“Don’t you? I thought your so- 
ciety was keen on a proper defini- 
tion of death.” 

“It is,” Wylatt said. “Death oc- 
curs when the heart no longer 
beats.” 

“In which case, Knowland is well 
and truly dead. He has no heart at 
all. But ... his brain is still con- 
scious, so we must consider him as 
maintaining an identity.” 

“He is conscious?” 

“As far as we can tell, yes. We 
have his brain constantly monitor- 
ed by EEG. From the time of his 
operation his mind has shown en- 
tirely normal activity.” 

“But what is keeping it alive?” 
“That machine,” the doctor 
said, pointing, “is called a heart- 
lung machine. It’s highly complex 
and very expensive. But its effect is 
more or less as its name implies. It 
artificially supplants the work of a 
human heart and lungs, in that it 
maintains blood at normal bodily 
temperature, reoxygenates it and 
circulates it through the body.” 
“And Knowland has been using 



the machine for how long?” 
“Fourteen days. Ever since the 
operation, in fact.” 

W ylatt got up- from his seat 
and walked to the window. 
He pressed his face against the 
thick glass and peered in at the 
man lying on the table. 

“But how can he be dead and 
conscious at the same time?” 

The doctor got up and stood 
beside him. 

“His body and nervous system 
have stopped functioning — that is 
all we know. There was short delay 
in supplying a glucose nutrient to 
the brain and we suspect the motor- 
functions of the main nervous 
system may have been damaged. 
The higher activity of the brain, 
though, is unimpaired. Of this we 
are absolutely certain. The electri- 
cal emission from the man’s brain 
is normal. You can see there — ” the 
doctor pointed to the EEG — “that 
there is nothing abnormal. He even 
sleeps and, as far as we can tell, 
dreams.” 

Wylatt looked at the long roll of 
graph paper slowly emerging from 
the machine, but could glean no 
sense from it. 

Finally he asked. “So what is to 
be done?” 

Samuelson shrugged. “What can 
we do? We provide a steady supply 
of blood to the brain and we feed it 
with glucose. We monitor the 
brain’s activity and keep careful 
note of anything that happens. We 



TRANSPLANT 



155 




anticipate that if the brain survives 
it will provide us with immense 
knowledge about its workings, but 
it’s still too early to tell.” 

‘‘You mean you are using this 
man as a guinea pig?” 

“If you like.” 

“But that’s inhuman!” 

The doctor shrugged again. 
“What should we do? Switch off 
the machines and let the brain die? 
That would be murder.” 

Wylatt stared at the man inside 
the sterile room. 

“He’s dead already — ” 

“ — and his widow has a death 
certificate,” Samuelson finished for 
him. “I signed it myself.” 

“Then the brain should be dis- 
connected.” 

“But we think that would be un- 
ethical.” The doctor went back and 
sat in his seat. “Which brings us to 
the purpose of your visit today. On 
a point of ethics, you say, the re- 
moval of a healthy organ from an 
otherwise dead body is a moral 
wrong — and yet by the same token 
to give continuing life to a human 
consciousness is equally wrong and 
should be stopped.” 

Wylatt said nothing. 

“Do you see the dilemma we are 
in, Mr. Wylatt?” 

“Yes,” he said. “I think so.” 
“And furthermore, do you now 
see why it would be wrong to make 
a moral test case of this unfortu- 
nate man? Think what an effect it 
would have on his widow. A loved 
one’s death is a tragedy from which 



we can all eventually recover — but 
will she recover from the sure 
knowledge that although the body 
has ceased to function the mind 
goes simmering on, unreachable? 
Because while Knowland’s mind 
still lives and is sane — we say he has 
a right to life. 

“If you want to question the right 
of surgeons to transplant vital 
organs from one human to another, 
then find another case to champion. 
You’ll find enough of them in this 
hospital alone. But with Arthur 
Knowland, while the fact that he 
lives is a miracle, attention of the 
public at large should not be drawn 
to what is happening.” 

Wylatt nodded. “Yes, I agree.” 
He bent down and picked up his 
black valise from the floor. “I don’t 
think any purpose would be served 
by my staying any longer.” 

He moved toward the door. 

“Mr. Wylatt.” 

“Yes?” 

“You’ll be tactful with Know- 
land’s widow, I trust.” 

‘‘Of course. Though I don’t 
know what I can tell her. Just offer 
sympathy, I suppose.” 

Samuelson nodded. 

Wylatt said, “What do you sup- 
pose he’s thinking about, Doctor 
Samuelson? I mean, as he lies there 
all day?” 

“I don’t think we’ll ever know. 
He can’t see anything, hear any- 
thing or touch anything. He cannot 
react to any thoughts he might have 
and cannot express himself in any 



156 



IF 




way. Every desire he has must lead 
to wish-fulfillment and, for all we 
know, he can imagine anything. 
His mind is liberated, you see. Any- 
thing he imagines, wishes or expects 
would be entirely real to him. He 
could build a whole world, I 
suppose, and it would be totally 
real and have substance and exis- 
tence. In some ways it’s man’s old- 
est dream. But in others it could be 
a hell we cannot conceive of. I 
suppose. Still, why should a brain 
imagine a hell for itself? Except 
temporarily. While it is recovering 
from injury, say, or the shock of 
disembodiment.” 

Wylatt stared at him for several 
seconds. His face, which had been 
jaunty and alert when he arrived, 
was now somber and thoughtful. 

“Yes,” he said and extended his 
hand to the doctor. “Thank you for 
your time — and for showing me.” 
Samuelson waited until the man 
had been ushered out by the nurse 
in the outer office, then stood up 
and walked to the glass window. He 
stared in at the remains of Arthur 
Knowland and watched the expres- 
sionless movements of the dials and 
needles. In that embalmed human 
body lay an active brain; conscious, 
sane, and with an existence unique 
and precious. What dreams of a 
liberated brain? What hopes or 
visions? What life? 

H e opened his eyes again and 
she was still there. 
“Veronica!” 



She laughed. “You weren’t ex- 
pecting to find anyone else here, 
were you?” 

And then he was laughing, too. 

Much later he got out of bed 
and walked to the window. Down 
below was the street, looking as he 
had always known it was supposed 
to look. Cars, new ones and old 
ones, lined the sidewalks — and the 
leaves were dropping with autumnal 
imprecision from trees the length of 
the street. In the houses opposite 
his lights shone and people moved 
behind clean, unbroken window 
panes. 

It was as it should be, as he had 
always remembered it to be. 

Momentarily his hand lifted to 
the left side of his chest and his 
fingers explored between his ribs 
for the feel of that erratic flutter 
that had crippled him for much of 
his life. But that had cured itself. 
His heart was bold and healthy. 

He turned back to the bed. 
Veronica was as beautiful as the 
day he had married her. He 
stepped toward her and caught a 
sight of himself in the tall mirror on 
the wardrobe door. He too, had lost 
thirty years and stood upright in 
the cool light of the morning. 

He placed his hands on the edge 
of the mattress, leaned over and 
kissed her. She smiled and reached 
up joyfully and pulled him down on 
top of her. 

Outside, the world created by 
Arthur Knowland went on as he 
knew it should. •

PERFORMANCE 

He thought he had found the 
only woman on Earth— but 
could he ever be sure? 



GORDON EKLUND 



T Ihe last man on Earth came 
driving down the hard-packed 
dirt road that wound among green 
peaks. Turning left, he drove along 
the shore of a wide blue lake; then 
followed the decaying pavement of 
the old highway until it cut through 
a countryside of flat green pastures. 
At last he reached the line of 
swaying wooden buildings that 
marked the informal boundary be- 
tween country and town. 

Here, finally, the last man 
brought his vehicle — a battered 
station wagon whose mechanical 
components he had scrounged in a 
thousand towns and villages. He 
stared at a tiny filth-encrusted 
hovel. Stuck in the ground in front' 
of it, a torn sign said: gas. Since 
the car’s horn had long ago uttered 
its last mournful wail, he forced 
down the side window, leaned out. 




“Anybody here?” 

It was a hot day — sweltered, the 
still air clogged with swimming 
particles of dry dust. Beyond this 
settlement lay the hard edge of the 
continental forest yet hardly a 
flower grew here, barely a blade of 
parched grass. It was just like these 
creatures, he thought, to choose 
such a forsaken wilderness in which 
to build their town. 

A door slammed. A figure ap- 
peared. Tall, handsome, dark, age- 
less — practically indistinguishable 
from any of them. And they had the 
nerve to call themselves men! This 
one came forward and stopped, 
bracing himself against the side of 
the car, and thrust his head for- 
ward through the open window so 
that his face nearly touched that of 
the last man. 

“I know you. You’re the magi- 
cian!” 

“I am Phobias. Yes,” the last 
man said. 

“You plan to do your show 
here?” The tall, dark man did not 
wait for an answer. Immediately he 
added, “I can remember when you 
came through here last time. I was 
just a boy. You had a wagon and a 
team of big gray horses — ” 

“The horses died,” Phobias said. 
The man nodded, backing away 
from the car. Between his spindly 
splayed legs, a small whirlwind of 
dust suddenly rose. “I guess you 
want some gas.” 

“I would appreciate that.” 

“And in return you’ll put on your 



show. Is that what you’ll promise?” 

“Correct.” 

“Then how about you do the 
show first? Afterward I’ll give you 
the gas. Tonight, say, after the sun 
has set.” 

Phobias smiled. “So you’ve 
heard.” 

The man nodded. “I’ve got two 
kids. Ever since they could under- 
stand words, they’ve been hearing 
about you — about Phobias. I’m not 
about to see them cheated.” 

“Well — ” Phobias shrugged. He 
was not embarrassed although the 
man had hit the nail on the head. 
Phobias had intended to obtain 
gasoline in return for a promise of 
magical delights and then go 
sprinting away. There was another 
big lake out there and two smaller 
villages and finally the vast green 
forest. The truth was that after 
more years than he could remem- 
ber, Phobias no longer derived the 
faintest pleasure from his act. He 
would rather cheat than perform, 
rather lie than conjure. He could 
always order this man to do his 
bidding but that would be magic 
too, and the magic was reserved for 
the act. “Where shall I put on the 
show?” he asked. 

“How about right there?” The 
man pointed to a bare and dusty 
field across the road. 

“No. It may rain.” 

“So? Rain hardly gets one wet.” 

“Not you maybe. It gets me 
wet.” 

“All right,” said the man, and 



CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE 



159 




quickly — as though memorized es- 
pecially for the occasion — he sup- 
plied Phobias with a set of careful 
directions. “Talk to a man named 
Ernest when you get there. He’ll see 
that you’re fixed up with a place,” 
he finished, stepping backward. He 
disappeared into the grimy house, 
where two pale faces hung like 
frozen white shadows in the sagging 
rectangle of a window. 

Phobias drove on, reaching the 
dilapidated streets of the town. He 
chose to ignore the curious stares of 
pedestrians trudging along the high 
wooden sidewalks, merchants peer- 
ing through dust-coated panes. He 
ignored too the wound always with 
him — the knowledge that he was 
the last man, the only man, on this 
whole big dead world. 



N ot until he had stopped the 
car — hearing the engine gasp- 
ing over the final few drops of gaso- 
line — did Phobias recognize the 
place. Yes, he had performed in 
this town before. He got out, 
placing his shoeless feet firmly in 
the warm dust. Stepping forward, 
turning his head slightly first left 
and then right, he was able to re- 
member the last time he had passed 
through. She had still been living 
then. In fact, as far as he could 
recall, it was near here — either in 
the next village or the one just after 
that — that the jagged lightning had 
fallen from the heavens to claim her 
life. If he came upon the spot, he 



would not choose to pause and visit 
her grave. For he held her — even in 
death — strictly accountable for the 
absurdity of her own end. He pre- 
ferred not to face the past; there 
was far too much of it. And now, 
tramping across the wooden walk, 
he recalled something else — when 
he had buried her. It had not been 
the last time he had been in this 
town. No. Nor even the time before 
that. It had been a thousand years 
ago. At least. 

“Ernest?” he queried. 

“Who. wants him?” asked the 
man behind the counter. 

“Phobias.” 

“I’m Ernest.” 

Arrangements were quickly and 
smoothly settled. Phobias gave his 
word when requested. So did 
Ernest. 

“Then I’ll see you at eight,” he 
said. 

Phobias nodded. “I think I’ll go 
over there now.” 

“Want anything to eat first?” 

“No, thank you. I have to set up 
my things.” 

He found the ancient car sur- 
rounded by a flock of milling 
children. One girl separated herself 
from the others and stepped boldly 
forward. “You’re the magician!” 
Identical with her myriad brothers 
and sisters, she was dark-haired, 
yellow-eyed. 

“I am.” He trudged to the rear of 
the car, let down the gate, began to 
remove various implements needed 
for the act. The auditorium was a 



160 



IF 




mere block away; he could walk it 
easily from here. 

“Any of you like to lend a 
hand?” 

The girl who had already spoken 
rushed to his side. In addition to 
the children, a cluster of adults 
stood upon the wooden sidewalk, 
carefully observing the proceedings. 

“Is this something magic?” The 
girl took the heavy black cloth from 
Phobias’ hands. 

It was only his cape, but he an- 
swered, “You’ll see tonight.” 

“You change people into ani- 
mals, don’t you?” 

“Sometimes. But I always change 
them back.” The girl waited for 
him to give her more to carry. But 
he was determined to be scrupuous- 
ly fair. “Take the cape to the audi- 
torium.” 

“But this isn’t heavy.” 

“That’s all for you,” he insisted. 
He gave the next article — a brief- 
case containing variously colored 
powders — to a small boy. Re- 
buffed, the girl went off. The boy 
followed. As if from a distance, 
Phobias could hear the adults 
speaking above him on the side- 
walk. 

“When I was a boy ...” one 
began. 

“I remember him, too.” 

“He made my brother disappear. 
You couldn’t see the poor guy.” 

“. Or floating in the air — fly- 
ing like a bird.” 

“Here — you take this.” Phobias 
handed a girl a small basket con- 



taining his dirty laundry; but she 
would never have to know. 

The adults chattered on. 

“I can hardly wait to see him.” 

“He’s the best magician ever!” 

Phobias was closing the car-gate 
preparatory to dismissing the chil- 
dren when he happened to glance 
up. It was then that he saw her. 

He stared. 

She could not have been more 
than sixteen or seventeen. Her hair, 
soft and smooth as silk, fell to her 
bare shoulders. And it was yellow! 

Unlike the others, she was not 
completely nude. A narrow belt of 
brown animal-skin darted between 
her thighs then circled her waist. 
Her skin was exceedingly pale — 
nearly as white as polished ivory. 
Adorning her chest were twin 
mounds — bare adolescent breasts 
tipped by bright pink nipples. 
Phobias knew he was staring. But 
she was staring too and her eyes, 
like his, were blue and plaintively 
clear. 

“Give me something else to 
carry.” 

At the sound of the sharp voice, 
Phobias wheeled as though struck. 
A dark girl gazed at him, her hands 
empty and waiting. 

He snapped, “No!” More gently 
he added, “That’s all I have.” He 
turned back, looking desperately 
for the blond girl. She had gone. 

He whispered. “Who?” 

“Huh?” said the dark girl. 

“Who was — ?” He made himself 
stop. There existed no means by 



CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE 



161 




which he could force these crea- 
tures to understand what he had 
just seen. Staring along the length 
of the walk, he thought he glimpsed 
the girl again as she rounded the 
corner of a decrepit building. Two 
men marched behind her, almost 
as though they served as an escort. 
Who? Her father? Brothers? 

He could not know. 

“Never mind,” he said. 



H is own hair was white. Theirs 
was black. For so many hun- 
dred years had this been the case 
that he had long since come to be- 
lieve it the natural order of things. 
His eyes were blue and theirs were 
yellow. They had never seemed to 
notice that he was different, and he 
had rarely bothered to notice much 
about them either, for they were a 
million while he was only one. 

Phobias was sitting on the edge 
of the improvised stage, legs dang- 
ling into empty darkness. He shut 
his eyes, seeing her — the yellow 
hair, blue eyes, tender young 
breasts. Unbelievable! He was the 
last man, yes — but not the last of 
mankind, as he had thought. She 
had to be human. Or was there a 
catch to it? Some trick or masquer- 
ade? Tonight she would come to 
the performance — everyone did — 
and he would find out for certain. 

The children had gone home. It 
was the dinner hour. Although the 
sun still clung to the edge of the 
sky, the clouds had risen to conceal 



its red disk. Rain fell harshly. 
Phobias left the stage and crossed 
the darkened auditorium of what 
once had been a schoolhouse, 
threading his way between benches. 
The place would hold a couple of 
hundred spectators, including 
standees, all looking like so 'many 
mirror images of each other. But if 
the girl were among them, he did 
not doubt that he would recognize 
her instantly. She would stand out 
as clearly as a cut diamond among 
pebbles. 

He stopped in a doorway and 
looked out, watching the rain con- 
verting the street dust to mud, 
listening to the drops pound the 
crude sidewalks. 

A “man” passed, undismayed by 
the downpour, his naked body 
exuding slick oils impervious to the 
plummeting wetness. Sometimes — 
when he stopped to think of 
it — Phobias was amazed by how 
casually he referred to these crea- 
tures as men. For they were not. 
They were born of men as surely as 
mankind had once been spawned 
by the gods, but they were not men 
any more than Phobias was a god. 
Once — before the time of the great 
plague of madness that had cleans- 
ed Earth of its masters — they had 
been called androids, and had been 
scattered and few. Now they were 
many and man was only one. 

But wait, thought Phobias. His 
heart pounded. What of her? 

When the rain fell, did she feel as 
he did — threatened by dampness 



162 



IF 




and chill? Where was she now? At 
home, he guessed, gazing through 
a steamy windowpane, watching 
the wetness that cascaded beyond. 
And what did the girl see out there? 
Did she see his face in the rain as he 
was seeing hers? Would she know 
that he was a human being, of 
genuine blood and ancient genes 
and true flesh, as he was convinced 
she was? 

As suddenly as it had come, the 
storm fled. The sky briefly turned 
silver, then faded into night. The 
muddied street was empty now, si- 
lent. Phobias turned away and 
shuffled back to his props. 

H e sat alone upon the flood- 
lighted stage, gazing at the 
massed audience patiently waiting. 
He could make out the dark 
polished faces of the throng stand- 
ing along the dull walls and filling 
the seats. The identical heads 
loomed as though from some 
horribly repetitous nightmare. Af- 
ter the passage of centuries, Pho- 
bias was quite accustomed to the 
phenomenon and did not let it dis- 
turb him. He sat upon a stool, his 
legs crossed. A thin cigar — one of 
the few remaining in his private 
stock — glowed between the fingers 
of his right hand. He wore his black 
cape, his white leather gloves and 
his tall glimmering top hat. Behind 
him, neatly spread upon a wooden 
bench, were the tools of his trade: a 
polished wand, two glasses full of 
water, a red bandanna and a pair 



of long scissors. Nothing else. 

But he would not be needing 
these things tonight, he told him- 
self. For she had come at last, ar- 
riving after he had nearly sur- 
rendered hope. Now he could see 
her face clearly rising from the 
darkness of the last row, like a 
single star amid the blankness of an 
otherwise empty sky. He tried to 
smile at her to communicate his 
knowledge of her predicament, that 
of a human being among androids, 
just as he was. But when she failed 
to meet his gaze, he understood. It 
was not yet time for that. First the 
proof would have to be presented; 
that was only proper and fair. The 
smiles would naturally follow. 

The audience waited stolidly. 
Take two hundred true human 
beings — the flesh-and-blood kind — 
and pack them into a school audi- 
torium with promises of a magic 
show. Let the performer merely sit 
upon the bright stage, gazing 
ahead into their massed ranks. Feet 
would soon be shuffling, throats 
coughing, hands twitching and 
wringing. Such was not the case 
with these creatures. Phobias whis- 
pered contemptuously, “An- 
droids!” Their communal capacity 
for patience was infinite, for man — 
true man — had made them that 
way. 

At last Phobias decided to get on 
with it. 

“Good evening,’’ he said. 
“Ladies and gentlemen. Children.” 
He tapped the ash from his

smoldering cigar, took a lingering 
puff, blew thick, curling smoke. 
“Behind me on the bench you may 
observe the few articles with which 
I normally commence my perfor- 
mance.” He smiled sympathetical- 
ly. “But on this occasion I choose to 
treat the intelligence of my audience 
with the utmost respect. Here — ” 

Standing up carefully, smoking, 
he moved to the bench. He lifted 
the red bandanna and waved it. 

“Do you really need to see me cut 
this old cloth into pieces, then 
watch while I recreate the whole be- 
fore your astonished eyes?” He 
dropped the bandanna contemptu- 
ously, letting it flutter to the stage. 
“Or these glasses of water?” He 
tapped one with a fingernail. “Do 
you wish to observe as I suspend the 
contents above the floor of this 
stage, thus defying the laws of 
nature? And this magic wand?” 
Laughing, he tossed it over his 
shoulder. “I really don’t think we 
have any need of it tonight. I feel 
none of you have come here tonight 
to see silly tricks. Let us dispense 
with these props. Forget them.” 

He stepped forward, striding to 
the lip of the stage. There he gazed 
ahead, balanced upon tensed knees 
like a sea captain staring into the 
entrails of an approaching storm. 

“We shall move immediately to 
the crux — the red meat — of my act. 
I will need a volunteer.” His eyes 
scanned the last row, passing back 
and forth across the place where 
the girl sat. “You, sir,” he said 



randomly, then pointed at the dark 
figure of a man. “Step up here, 
please.” 

The man marched to the stage. 
Phobias awaited his arrival, stand- 
ing calmly, trying not to look at the 
girl. The man approaching could 
have been any of those he had met 
already — the gas-station attendant 
or the storekeeper, Ernest — or any 
other one of them, seen or unseen, 
known or unknown, in this or any 
other town. 

“I hope,” said Phobias, “you do 
not object to assisting me for a brief 
moment.” He flung away his cigar, 
letting the stump smolder on the 
wooden floor. 

“Glad to help. What shall I—?” 

Phobias cut off his words with a 
slashing hand. Then he proceeded 
to pace the length of the stage, 
glancing out at the huddled mass of 
the audience. Suddenly, like a 
dancer, he whirled, then he spoke 
in a low, measured voice. He hardly 
comprehended his own words. How 
many thousand thousand times 
previously had he been thus im- 
pelled to state his role and purpose? 

“I shall make you see what you 
have never seen before. I shall 
make you unable to see what' you 
have always seen before. Why? 
How? That much I cannot freely re- 
veal. But if, during the next few 
moments, you come to doubt the 
evidence of your own senses, then I 
say you must elect to doubt your 
sanity as well. And I guarantee you 
this: madness is not my trade. I am 



164 



IF 




a magician and that alone. I toy 
with the unknown as an infant 
plays with a rattle. I allow you to 
glimpse— r-but only to glimpse — the 
mysteries of my personal detour 
into darkness/’ 

He whirled again, swirling his 
cape. 

“Now, sir,’’ he said to the open- 
mouthed man from the audience, 
“would you mind stepping forward 
into the light so that everyone may 
get a good look at you?” Lightly he 
touched the man’s hip. “Turn, if 
you don’t mind. Show them that 
you’re all here — let them know 
you’re real. 

P hobias could feel them out 
there, becoming excited. As ex- 
cited as it was possible for them to 
become, that is. The older ones, 
having seen the magic before, com- 
municated their sense of anticipa- 
tion to their ignorant daughters 
and sons. 

‘“Fine,” Phobias said, placing 
his hands over his eyes. “Please — I 
must ask for silence.” When he 
could not hear them breathing, he 
began to count aloud. “One . 
two . three ...” Reaching 
twenty, he lowered his hands, 
opened his eyes. Then, raising a 
clenched fist, he cut a swath 
through the air. 

“Now!” he cried. He took a half- 
step forward. 

And stopped. 

“You are a dog,” he told the 
dark person on the stage. “When 



you hear my fingers snap once.” 

“Yes.” 

“Then be a dog.” And he 
snapped his fingers. 

The man dropped instantly to his 
hands and knees. Without so much 
as glancing at him, Phobias went to 
the stool and sat down. Deliber- 
ately, as the man’s shrill yips and 
yowls resounded, he placed a fresh 
cigar between his teeth. The man 
came trotting over, sniffing sus- 
piciously. 

“Roll over,” Phobias com- 
manded. 

The man fell on his back, hands 
and feet pointing at the roof. 
Phobias walked to the edge of the 
stage, leaned down. 

“Anyone have a match?” 

Somebody did; Phobias lit up 
and puffed. 

“Stop,” he told the subject on 
the stage. “You may stand. On two 
feet.” His fingers snapped. “You 
are yourself, again.” 

The man nodded. “I am.” 

Phobias faced his audience. As 
always, there was no applause, no 
laughter, nothing. A gentle hissing 
sound erupted briefly, but that was 
all. His eyes came to rest on the 
blond girl. She was gazing straight 
back at him. Blue eyes. Pale skin. 
For a moment he could not look 
away. 

“Soon,” he murmured. 

“What?” queried the man. 

Phobias wrenched himself back 
to business. “You remember noth- 
ing?” 



CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE 



165 




“No,” the man admitted. 

Phobias realized he was rushing 
his act, forcing the end that ought 
not to come for several hours. 
Often in the past he had performed 
until dawn, lusting in the excite- 
ment of his own performance, 
refusing to relinquish the stage 
until he had given up all hope of ex- 
tracting some response. Not that 
response ever came. These people — 
androids, he thought — did not 
enjoy what he did, for they could 
enjoy nothing — not love for fear, 
not magic. They could pay atten- 
tion, yes. And they could become 
excited. Curiosity and excitation 
had been built into them as survival 
tools, but that was about it. 

“He is a bird,” Phobias told the 
audience. The man’s face, when 
Phobias looked at it, was blank. 
“You are a bird.” 

“I am.” 

“Then, for us, fly.” And snap- 
ped his fingers. 

The man flapped his arms, 
straining at the flat and dusty air. 

Phobias whispered to the audi- 
ence, “He flies.” 

Then he sat on his stool again, 
smoking. The audience watched 
the flight of the captive bird. What 
was it to them? Hawk? Eagle? 
Sparrow? Once, in a distant village 
in the southern continent, Phobias 
had said, “He is a bird.” But the 
villagers had never seen an actual 
bird. Phobias remembered that 
rocky mocking land, treeless, where 
the sun rarely came. “He flies.” 



But they had not known. They had 
asked for explanations . 

This man cawed and twisted on 
the stage, arms helplessly flapping. 
The audience watched silently. 

Phobias rose from the stool, 
waved his cigar. “You are your- 
self,” he said. 

The man ceased his charade, re- 
gained awareness. But still no ap- 
plause, no laughter. Silence. 

Phobias bowed stiffly. 

“And now,” he announced, “the 
heart of my act. A descent into the 
great chasm of the unknown.” He 
waved the first volunteer away. 
“Another?” he asked, but there 
was none. Phobias searched the 
audience, pointed. “You, sir.” A 
man sitting beside the blond girl. 
“I ask that you join me, please.” 

Phobias watched the girl, seeing 
surprise and wonder on her face. 
And more? Was it fear he saw? 
Pleasure? It had been so long since 
he had witnessed true emotion in 
another that interpretation of her 
expression came hard to him. 

T |he man stood beside him. 

Phobias could not stop himself: 
“That girl — ” His eyes indicated 
whom he meant. ‘‘Is she your 
daughter?” 

“She is.” 

“Where did you get her?” 
“From . , from . .” The man 
struggled to speak the ugly for- 
bidden term. 

“Not from there. Tell me the 
truth.” 



166 



IF 




“Well, from . from . .” 

It was the girl who made Phobias 
stop. He was gazing at her again. 
Her lips folded downward, the pale 
skin above her eyes creased and 
strained — her whole cast of counte- 
nance begged him not to proceed. 

He hesitated, then addressed the 
audience, using well-memorized 
phrases to conceal his confusion. “I 
must ask for complete silence. Even 
the slightest sound might destroy 
the mental equilibrium necessary 
for what shall ensue. This man — ’’ 
gesturing behind “ — will soon die. 
It is my intention to return him 
then to full and natural life.” 
Murmurs of curiosity from the 
audience. Hisses of excitement. 

Phobias said, “Lie down. Yes. 
That’s right. Now extend your arms 
straight out from your sides. And 
your feet — separate the heels. Yes, 
that’s fine.” Normally this would 
be the climax of his act — his 
grandest achievement. “No, don’t 
close your eyes. You must keep 
them open.” 

He threw away the cigar, faced hi 
audience. 

“Another volunteer.” He select- 
ed a woman from the front row. 
“Come up here, would you?” 
When everything was ready — the 
man lying upon the stage, the 
woman standing at his side — Pho- 
bias kneeled. He moved his hands 
over the man — first down and then 
up — covering every square inch of 
the body but never actually touch- 
ing it. 



“Death calls to you,” Phobias 
said. “He shall bestow upon you 
peace and tranquility. You hear the 
call. Life ebbs from your physical 
self. Although you can feel life leav- 
ing, you are not afraid. You are 
lonely but prepared. Tell me.” 

“I am lonely,” the man echoed 
softly. “I am prepared.” 

“Not afraid?” 

“No, I am not afraid.” 

“Death has come to claim you. 
Life flows gently away. You feel it 
abandon your lungs, your heart. 
From them, your life flows like 
clean water into the veins of your 
arms. Into your skin. Into the 
air — ” Phobias snapped his fingers. 
“Now life is gone!” 

The man upon the floor neither 
moved nor spoke. 

“He is dead,” Phobias said. Re- 
gaining his feet, with his hands he 
swept the dust from his knees. He 
eyed the woman crouched beside 
the supine man. “Is he breathing?” 
“No,” she said woodenly. 
“Check his heart.” 

She placed her ear upon the 
man’s breast. 

“Tell them that he’s dead,” 
Phobias said. 

Softly the woman intoned: “He is 
dead.” 

“Louder.” 

Distinctly: “He is dead.” 
Phobias nodded. “Thank you.” 
He allowed the woman to leave the 
stage. 

He could not resist a look at the 
girl. Yes — that was fear on her 



CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE

face. He was sure of it. Emotion! 
Phobias pointed a finger at her. 
“Come here,” he said. “Come up 
here.’’ 

She hesitated, then walked slowly 
to the stage and mounted it. Now it 
was his turn to feel fear. He 
reached into a pocket and felt for a 
cigar. 

“Is he really dead?’’ 

Phobias stared at her adolescent 
beauty. A bare yard separated 
them. “He is.” 

She crouched. Raising the sub- 
ject’s wrist in her hand, she gazed 
up at Phobias. 

“Tell them,” he said. 

She released the wrist. The hand 
dropped soundly to the floor. “Tell 
them what?” 

“Tell them he’s dead.” 

“But he’s not.” 

“He’s not dead?” 

“No.” 

“But tell them that he is.” 

The girl lowered her head, 
placing her ear upon her father’s 
heart. 

Then she stood up. “No, he’s not 
dead.” 

“You won’t tell them that he is.” 
“Of course not. He isn’t.” 

“You are a dog,” Phobias said. 
She shook her head. 

“Fly.” 

“I can’t fly.” 

“Fly!” he shouted. 

“No!” She rushed toward him, 
pounded his chest with little fists. 
“You make him stand up — I want 
him to be conscious again.” 



Phobias nodded. He told the 
dead man: “You are living.” But 
the magician did not mean it. No, it 
was she who was alive — not the cold 
dead creature now rising from the 
floor. Even in life, that thing would 
always be dead. But she — she lived. 

At last he had elicited the re- 
sponse sought so long. Denial. 
Emotional opposition. 

His eyes were stinging with the 
torment of his joy. 

P hobias forced them to give him 
the gasoline. At first they had 
refused, saying that he had failed to 
fulfill the agreement. The children 
had been sorely disappointed. 

Phobias said, “Do what I ask. I 
am ordering you. Bring gasoline. 
Prepare my car.” 

And then they had acceded. For 
the first time in centuries he had 
used his magical powers outside the 
confines of his act — for personal 
and private gain. But he felt that he 
possessed the right — for was he not 
a man? 

The girl lived outside the town. 
He made them tell him exactly 
where. He drove there quickly, 
careless of the ruts and pits of the 
decayed highway. The house was 
set back from the road. A single 
window — a rectangle of yellow 
amid the black — gleamed brightly. 

Asleep? He approached and 
pressed his face to the glass. No, 
her eyes were open. She lay upon 
her back in a narrow bed. Pink 
sheets. The walls of the bedroom — 



168 



IF 




plain and undecorated — were also 
pink. 

He broke the window-glass with 
a rock, reached inside, raised the 
lower frame. She did not stir as he 
crawled through the opening. Then 
he paused, listening to the silence 
of the house. 

The girl opened her eyes then. 
She showed no alarm. 

“What do you want?” 

“I’ve come — ” Phobias stopped. 
He thought he had heard a footfall. 
“I’ll tell you later. Get up. We’re 
going.” 

“Where?” 

He waved an arm. “Away.” 

“They’ll stop us.” 

He laughed, striving to calm her 
immature misgivings. Then he 
heard it again: feet striking the 
floor. Coming closer. He grasped at 
the noise, saying, “If you don’t 
come with me, I’ll have to make 
him dead. You saw what I can do!” 

Frowning, she swung out of bed, 
started for the closet. 

Phobias stopped her. “You don’t 
have to take anything. Hurry!” 

He exited by way of the window. 
When his feet touched the grass, 
she stood at his side. 

“This way.” 

“They’ll follow and catch us,” 
she insisted. 

“No,” he said. 

“The other ones — I know they 
will.” 

Phobias laughed easily, placing 
an arm around her shoulders. “It’s 
just us, now.” 



But as they reached the road he 
looked over his shoulder, saw a line 
of fire approaching from town. 
Dozens of flaming torches swam in 
the night. 

“Them?” he cried. 

“Yes. I told you.’’ She drew 
closer. They clung to each other. 
“Let me return to the house,” she 
begged. 

“No.” He forced her into the car. 
“This machine can smash them, 
outrun them.’’ He started the 
engine. “Watch.” 

They were coming from every di- 
rection now. Phobias did not hesi- 
tate. He ran the car straight at their 
torches. A gleam of fire singed his 
eyes. Then a vision of incredible 
stunning whiteness. 

They were through. 

He exulted, shouting, slapping, 
the steering wheel: “See, see!” 

The girl pered behind through 
the rear window. “They’re still 
there,” she said. 

“But we’re here.” He slowed the 
car to prove that everything was all 
right. 

“Oh, no.” She glared at him, 
shaking her head. “Don’t you know 
they can drive, too?” 

“Not like us,” he said. 

as they neared the dark vastness 
of the forest, the first scattered 
trees heaved up beside the road like 
towering signs of warning. Phobias 
stopped the car. He opened the rear 
gate and removed the tools of his 
trade and threw them into the 



CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE 



169 




underbrush. As he did, he giggled. 
The girl seemed half asleep. But 
she smiled when he told her, “I 
won’t need them now.” 

They could live in the forest, he 
thought. Survival lay easily at their 
fingertips. The car zoomed for- 
ward. Were they ready yet for sons 
and daughters? For the new race to 
be born from the remnants of the 
old. For man returning to again 
rule his own domain. He reached 
out a hand and caressed her slender 
wrist. Her eyes, open but unaware, 
barely flickered. On and on they 
drove. 

Soon they were in the thickest 
part of the forest. The ancient road 
wound among huge twisted trees. 
The girl had slumped into a deep 
silence punctuated by frantic 
glances over her shoulder. They 
passed through a clearing and then 
a dark huddled village, a lamp 
suddenly flashing from one window 
as their headlight-beams stroked 
the tumbledown homes. 

“I wasn’t always the last man,” 
he said. He tried to explain to her. 
Before 1 the plague of madness, 
more than four billion • human 
beings had teemed the Earth. 
Afterward, barely a few thousand 
remained. He told her everything 
he knew of those forgotten times. 
He had been an astronaut, he said 
proudly. 

“A what?” she asked. 

He pointed through the wind- 
shield. Here the trees were thinned. 
Moonlight gleamed silver from a 



roadside pond whose silent dark 
waters reinforced his bitter recol- 
lections of yesterday. ‘‘See those 
lights.” He meant the stars. ‘‘Know 
what they are?” 

She knew. 

‘‘Well, I went up there.” 

‘‘To the stars?” 

‘‘No, but to planets. Jupiter. 
Mars. Also the moon.” 

“You traveled to the moon?” 

“I did.” 

“How? By magic?” 

A kind of magic, he said, and 
promised to explain someday. Then 
he told her that he had been one of 
a dozen men and women selected to 
make the first journey to a star — 
not a planet or a moon, but a real 
star. The voyage was to last four 
hundred years. The crew had been 
injected with a complex of new 
drugs designed to increase longev- 
ity. “So we could live to see our 
world again.” All of that had 
happened thousands of years ago. 
“But the plague of madness came, 
and because of it none of us ever 
left. We stayed here on Earth and 
I, at least, have lived almost for- 
ever. Those drugs — ” 

He remembered well. A year 
before the scheduled departure, the 
starship crew had gone into train- 
ing. They had been placed inside a 
model of the ship that would carry 
them to the stars, and this model 
had been lowered to the bottom of 
the Pacific Ocean. Suitably shield- 
ed from the pressure at ocean 
depths, of course. There they had 



170 



IF 




stayed for seven months, constantly 
monitered from above but without 
the security of reciprocal contact or 
any knowledge of exterior time or 
events. They were left alone — a 
dozen men and women — forced to 
live wholly isolated from the world. 

“And we survived,’’ he said. 
“But when our training time was 
over and we were raised to the sur- 
face, we were greeted only by 
androids. Androids and corpses 
and a handful of madmen.” 

The plague of madness had first 
broken out within the Ganymede 
settlement on one of the moons of 
Jupiter. In less than a month, every 
man in the colony had been dead. 

“The androids told us,’’ said 
Phobias, “that the disease pro- 
gressed in three distinct stages. The 
first, lasting approximately a week, 
was classic schizophrenia. For 
many years it had been theorized 
that the underlying causes of that 
mental disorder were physical — 
viral, bacteriological, something 
like that. And now it was proved. 
The plague victim immediately lost 
all touch with reality. In the second 
stage, he became catatonic. In the 
third, he died. There were no sur- 
vivors once the disease began.” 

The girl said wearily, “My name 
is Eva.” 

“Eva! How beautiful. Listen to 
me, Eva. That plague spread faster 
than any other in history. It leaped 
from Ganymede to Mars and then 
to Earth. In less than six months, 
everyone susceptible was either 



dead or dying. We asked the an- 
droids whether any men at all had 
survived. 

“‘Only those like yourselves,’ 
they told us. ‘Those inoculated with 
the longevity medicine. Too late it 
was realized that the stuff is a pre- 
ventative. Oh, some others — past 
sufferers from schizophrenia, both 
the cured and uncured; they are 
immune and they have survived. 
And us — androids. We were not af- 
fected.’” 

Phobias paused, negotiating the 
old car over a jagged hole in the 
road. He glanced at the girl. Was 
she listening? 

“So we set off in search of the 
survivors, finding most of them — a 
few thousand — and the years 
passed and they died too but we did 
not. It was a lonely life for us. But a 
simple one, for the androids were 
always there to tend to our desires. 
But gradually the crew began to die 
off. Accidents occurred. A woman 
was murdered by a man who had 
loved her for more than three 
hundred years. I left, taking one of 
the other women with me. We took 
an automobile and started to 
wander the world.” 

And the androids had forgotten. 
They had reproduced themselves by 
virtue of the knowledge man had 
granted them, maintaining the 
automated factories. When the old 
ones of the first generation — those 
who had lived through the plague — 
wore out and were discarded, their 
grandsons and granddaughters had

continued on, ignorant of what they 
truly were. Indeed, they had come 
to call themselves “men.” And 
their numbers had rapidly multi* 
plied and in time they had peopled 
the world in the same great num- 
bers as their original creators. 
“And my race — our race — the hu- 
man race — toppled to the very edge 
of extinction.” 

Phobias had slowed the car, was 
peering intently through the wind- 
shield. 

“She died near here. The woman. 
Oh, I can’t remember exactly 
when. A bolt of lightning came 
from the sky and killed her 
instantly — killed her and our horses 
and set the wagon afire. I nearly 
died, too. Later I tried to find the 
others but all were gone. Some had 
died. The rest were lost. Since then, 
I have continued to wander alone — 
a magician — Phobias — moving 

quietly through the android towns 
and villages. Searching for a human 
being. But now I have found one. I 
am not alone any more.” 

S he had fallen asleep, slumped 
back in the seat, face buried in 
the dark.. 

He pulled over -to the side of the 
road, killed the engine and climbed 
out. The silence woke her. An in- 
stant later she was standing beside 
him, gazing up at dark tree-tops 
and the stars. 

“I don’t want to drive any 
more,” he said. “We can stay here 
till morning.” 



“All right.” 

He pointed into the trees. “Let’s 
take a look.” He lighted a match to 
show the way. Then another. The 
forest around them whispered in 
the wind. 

“Here.” He drew her down be- 
neath a massive balsam. “Let’s rest 
here. The air is sweet and the 
needles make the ground soft.” 

He wanted to take her in his 
arms. He placed his dead cigar 
between his teeth and relit it. 
No . too soon. She had curled 
up at his feet, as if asleep, but the 
glare of the match revealed her eyes 
open and alert. 

“That smells awful,” she said. 

He smiled, exhaling smoke. “Not 
to me.” He stretched out comfort- 
ably. “Did you hear what I told 
you?” 

“Most of it, I guess.” 

“Then you must understand why 
I ran off with you, Eva. You don’t 
belong there with those — those 
things. You belong here with me. 
We’re the only two human beings 
left — and we can people the earth!” 

He sensed her hesitation, her re- 
luctance to reply. She was bur- 
dened with unspoken words. 

“What is it?” he demanded. 

“I can’t tell you, magician.” 

“Why?” 

“They said I shouldn’t. That 
there was no need. You weren’t 
supposed to see me. You weren’t 
supposed to do this — take me 
away. I want to go home.” 

“No!” He grabbed her. In his 



172 



IF 




fingers, her wrist seemed fragile as 
a twig. “What have you to tell me? 
Out with it!” 

“All right, then. We’re not the 
same.” 

A long silence. 

“We are!” he cried piteo'usly. 
“We must be.” 

“No,” she said. “I’m not like 
you. And there are more of us, 
many more, more each day. We’re 
not like you or like the androids 
either. We’re different.” 

“Impossible! Are you saying that 
you are neither human nor an- 
droid?” 

Instead of answering she re- 
marked softly, without surprise, 
“Here they come.” 

He stared, seeing nothing at 
first. Then their torches burst into 
life, painting the forest with crude 
light. Phobias leaped to his feet, 
holding the girl. 

Relentlessly they closed in. Fair- 
haired. Ghostly pale. Was it pos- 
sible that all of them were human? 
Phobias tried desperately to think. 

“Let her go,” said their spokes- 
man, a blond woman whose face 
was young, whose unclad body 
shown pallid in the torchlight. 

“No!” shouted Phobias. “She’s a 
human being — like me. She’s not 
yours. Unless . .” He gulped. He 
could not bring himself to ask the 
question. 

But the woman answered it, 
shaking her head. “We are not 
human, nor is she. She is one of 
us.” 

CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE 



“The commandments,” he said 
desperately. “She does not obey.” 
He knew the commandments per- 
fectly; they had served him long 
and well. Born within all androids: 
Obey the directions of man. Cause 
no harm to befall his form. 

The woman stepped closer. She 
stopped inches in front of Phobias 
and raised her hand. Sharply, 
coldly, she slapped his face. He 
tasted blood upon his lips. 

“Give her to me,” the woman 
said, reaching out. “Or do you 
want us to beat you?” 

He glanced past the woman’s 
bare shoulders. There were so 
many of them — dozens — men, 
women, children — blond and pale, 
blue-eyed. Angry. Resentful. They 
were able to feel and show emotion. 
Like Eva. 

“How many are there?” he 
asked. 

“More each day. All over the 
world. Didn’t you realize it had to 
happen? We have read the old rec- 
ords. We know how it began. And 
this was the way it had to end. Man 
created androids to serve him. But 
man perished. And now androids 
have become men themselves.” 

“A lie,” Phobias said. “Except 
in name only, you can’t be men. 
You come from factories — like ma- 
chines. Men are born.” 

The woman reached out and 
snatched the girl, drew her close. 
The two hugged each other. ‘This 
girl,” the woman said, “is my 
daughter. She was bom to me. Her 

173 




father, whom you hypnotized, if 
grandson of Kanakoe, who devel- 
oped the process. Or maybe evolu- 
tion developed it, and revealed it 
first in Kanokoe. But we don’t need 
the factories. We are the new hu- 
manity. But you, Phobias, are the 
old.” 

A great loneliness engulfed him. 
He felt more alone than ever 
before. He was Phobias, the magi- 
cian, unique, the last man. When 
he commanded all were required to 
obey. But now the blood ran down 
his face and he was humbled. 

‘‘You hid yourselves from me,” 
he said. ‘‘You disguised yourselves 
to look like the others. You 
wouldn’t let me know.” 

“We saw no purpose in hurting 
you. If it hadn’t been for your race, 
ours would never have existed. We 
owed you something — the comfort 
of ignorance, at least. And you 
could not damage us, because you 
are the last.” 

“I am the last,” he whispered. 
He watched the woman and her 
daughter join the others. Illumi- 
nated by torchlight they disap- 
peared into the forest, leaving thick 
darkness behind. He slumped down 
upon the dry needles and held his 
head in his trembling hands. “I am 
the last man,” he said. “The only 
man.” 



P hobias, the magician, standing 
upon the stage, calmly stared 
out at his audience. Behind him, 



neatly arranged upon a bench, lay 
his reclaimed props. Where was 
he? He was not certain, but it made 
no difference. One village was like 
another. He traveled the world in 
endless circles, determined to prove 
what he knew so well: that he was 
the last man, the only man. 

The audience regarded him with 
pity. He nearly laughed in their 
faces. Their assumed compassion 
mocked their brutal honesty. They 
lied to him no longer. They rubbed 
his nose in the truth they had kept 
concealed so long. But he would 
prove to them somehow that he 
alone was a proper human. They 
would obey him — he would enforce 
the commandments — he would 
show them the deepest truths and 
force them to see. 

Their faces were mostly pale. 
Blond hair. Blue eyes that shone 
and glimmered. Raising an arm, he 
pointed at a tall man in the first 
row. 

“Step forward,” he said. “Come 
here.” 

The man came obediently. For a 
moment, Phobias experienced 
hope. Could he be winning at last? 
Had they finally chosen to acknowl- 
edge his superiority? They were 
androids. Whether born from fac- 
tory or womb, they were not men. 
When he told them to die, they 
must cease living. When he said, 
“You are a bird,” they must fly. 
What he told them to hear, they 
must hear. What he told them to 
see, they must see. 



174 



IF 




The man stood beside him on the 
stage. Phobias raised his wand and 
drew a rapid cross in the air. “I am 
a man,” he told the audience, “and 
you are androids. When I com- 
mand, you must obey.” 

Turning, he faced his subject. 
The man met his gaze with cold 
blue eyes. Softly, Phobias said, 
‘‘You are a bird — now fly.” 

The man stood frozen, motion- 
less. 

Phobias shouted: ‘‘Fly!” 

The man looked at his feet. 

“You must! I command you! 
Fly!” 

“No,” the man said softly. 

Phobias turned away. Would it 
ever come? Would they ever ac- 
knowledge his rightful station? Or 
would he be forced to wander alone 
for centuries more until that fateful 
day when some accident would 
finally strike him down and he 
would die, leaving the Earth to be 
ruled by them alone? 

He waved his hand meekly at the 
man: “You may go back and sit 
down — please.” 

There was nothing else for him. 
He had to go on. Eternity was his, 
and there was nothing else for him 
to do. 

He pointed blindly into the audi- 
ence. “You,” he said. As the girl 
came forward, blond hair, as long as 
her spine, he prepared himself to 
try again. He would command — 
she would obey. 

What choice did he have? Pho- 
bias was the last man. Wasn’t he? •

It was the computer’s revenge. 
In rage, in frenzy, he turned us 
into monstrosities, imprison- 
ing us deep inside his endless 
banks. Now I am a great soft 
jelly thing. 

I have no mouth. And I must 
scream. 

Harlan Ellison’s “I Have No 
Mouth and I Must Scream" 
packs such a wallop it walked 
off with a Hugo — science fic- 
tion’s Oscar — for the best short 
story of the year. Ellison’s wild 
tale is waiting for you in a 
sensational 864-page, double 
volume of all the Hugo winners 
from 1955 to 1970. This anthol- 
ogy can be yours as part of an 
equally sensational 4-books- 
for-100 offer when you join the
