Readers write — and wrongs 



Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

I was happy to see Robert F. 
Young's Abyss of Tartarus in the 
Oct. '71 issue of If. For those of 
your readers who may not know 
this, the story is actually a con- 
tinuation of Starscape with 
Frieze of Dreams from Orbit 8. 
Both stories are fine and I hope we 
hear more of Starfinder from Mr. 
Young. 

I was also wondering if per- 
haps a new area of fandom is 
opened by Mr. Young's "tele- 
hieroglyphics." It seems to be just 
the sort of thing fans enjoy play- 
ing around with; I would appreci- 
ate Hearing from other fans about 
this. 

Finally let me compliment you 
on your excellent magazine. You 
may, of course, print my name and 
address.

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

As a reader of both Science Fic- 
tion and Fantasy for the last 40 
years, I feel at least partly quali- 
fied to judge stories in both fields. 



I have read all the hardcover 
books in three libraries plus prac- 
tically- every paperback since 
1930. I am not a fan nor do I col- 
lect the magazines. The sole pur- 
pose of my purchase and reading 
of a book or magazine is for the 
enjoyment it gives me. I am not 
extremely critical of the author 
of a story or his writing style — he 
can miss a few points as he goes 
along or fail to tie his story togeth- 
er as he should. I do become irri- 
tated by the deliberate inclusion 
of a charactor in the plot who has 
no bearing on the story and is ob- 
viously there to fill out wordage. 

There is one type of science fic- 
tion and fantasy I have tried to 
like but cannot. This is the so 
called "new wave" that seems to 
consist of a veritable flood of de- 
scriptive words containing all 
foam and no beer. Only twice in 
40 years have I quit reading a 
story in sheer disgust and both 
times the writer was "new wave." 

/ wish to compliment you on 
your last issue of If, October 
1971. A better cross-section of 
topnotch writers would be ex- 
tremely hard to find in a bi- 
monthly magazine. I enjoyed 
each and every story although the 
story by Young required a knowl- 
edge of a previous story on the 
"What" to be completely com- 
prehensible. 

I would never presume to tell 
you how to edit a magazine. I am 
not a frustrated critic, writer or 



2 




editor and this letter is to let you 
know there is one of your readers 
who thinks you are doing an ex- 
cellent job, and will continue to 
do so in the future. 

One addition I do recommend is 
a subscription blank with every 
issue. You just might get more 
subscribers.

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

The dictionary defines 'fine 
arts'' as arts purely esthetic or 
expressive: painting, drawing, 
sculpture and architecture: some- 
times including literature, music, 
drama, and the dance. 

How about let's call or classify 
fiction, drama, art, poetry, and 
sculpture the "life arts," since they 
all simulate life. The life arts have 
a strong unifying basis for the 
classification, something in com- 
mon: they all copy, simulate, or 
imitate life. In the case of fiction 
and poetry, it is accomplished in- 
directly through word symbols: in 
the case of drama, it is done either 
way, through words if read, or live 
on stage (directly): pictures and 
sculpture, of course, are also di- 
rect. 

It is easy to see that architec- 
ture, music, and the dance do not 
simulate life, though the latter 
two may be expressive of it. The 
fine arts as a class is a very broad, 
diffuse classification, and they

/^IMOV*S RETURN-A MAJOR 
PUBLISHING EVENTI 



WE are proud to be able to announce 
forthcoming publication of Isaac 
Asimov's first new novel in 16 years, 
THE GODS THEMSELVES, it will appear 
in three fascinating installments sched- 
uled as follows: 

(1) Galaxy, March 1972~on sale 
January 25. 

(2) If, April 1972— on sale February 
25. 

(3) Galaxy, May 1972— on sale 
March 23. 

Why this unique arrangement? Well, 
we found THE GODS THEMSELVES so 
rewarding and exciting, so special in 
every way, that we were determined 
to bring it to our readers somehow. But 
since Galaxy and If are now bimonthly, 
to serialize this astounding novel in 
just one of them would have meant that 
we could not beat the deadline set for 
hardcover publication by Doubleday. 

Fortunately, sections 1 and 3 of the 
novel are quite complete in themselves 
and closely fit the "hard science" col- 
oration favored by Galaxy. On the 
other hand, section 2 of the novel- 
told from a different viewpoint— is per- 
fect for the generally more fanciful 
mood of If. Hence, with Dr. Asimov's 
blessing, we decided to split his new 
work between the two magazines— thus 
making sure we get it to s-f readers by 
the required date and in the proper 
setting. 

If your dealer does not handle one 
or the other, you can order single cop- 
ies of either Galaxy or If directly from 
us. Similarly, if you subscribe to only 
one of the magazines, you can order 
single copies of the other directly from 
us. We pay postage. 

In any event, don't miss this master- 
piece of a noval by the great and 
gifted Isaac AsimovI

PART ONE 




COLIN KAPP 




I 

T he night was shattered by a 
hundred copper candles, pres- 
sor beams bearing down, feather- 
ing the mighty bulk of a ship on to 
the center of the city, bruising the 
very bedrock with resonant thun- 
der. Green and violet, the lace 
traces of Yagi beams stabbed 
sharp disruption into the fabric of 
the buildings, and the quick flick 
of lasers struck fires that complet- 
ed the destruction. The city of As- 
hur on Onaris, razed by the blis- 
tering savagery from above, 
writhed in agony and prepared to 
surrender. Resistance was suicide 
— and even acquiescence held no 
guarantee of survival. 

Perhaps it started as a whisper in 
some white wilderness — the sick 
spite of a broken body, cradled in 
cold, crying futility unto a futile 
wind: 

DON'T YOU KNOW TH A T 
GOD IS DYING? 

In the uncertain shadows against 
a broken wall the figure of a 
young man lay in fetal position, 
only partially aware of the devasta- 
tion raging around him. Such con- 
sciousness as he bore was almost 
entirely consumed by a battle of 
equally desperate proportions deep 
within his skull. 

Perhaps in the sordid cells of 
some inhuman inquisition a spirit 
snapped, the mind mazed not by 
the searing steel, the nibbling nerve 
— but by a vaster wound: 



DON'T YOU KNOW THA T 
GOD IS DYING . DYING . 

The man moaned softly to him- 
self and rose to a sitting position, 
cradling his face in his hands. A 
Yagi beam, green and malignant, 
sliced the end from a nearby build- 
ing and the area was deluged with 
falling bricks. He sank back, un- 
able to fight. 

Perhaps some maimed martyr, 
crazed upon the cross, held up his 
head and cried unto the heavens: 
LORD, WHY HAST THOU 
FORSAKEN ME? 

And was answered never. The 
ultimate betrayal. The immaculate 
blasphemy . 

HASNOBODY EVEN 
TOLD YOU? 

THEY S A Y THAT GOD 
IS DEAD. 

The young man climbed to his 
feet and started slowly and still un- 
seeing across the littered square. 
His uncertain path took him near- 
ly into the beam of a probing 
Yagi, but fate and guesswork di- 
verted his feet. He blundered fi- 
nally into the wall of a building, 
recoiling with a bloody forehead 
to sink again into the timorous 
shadows of a ruined doorway. 

Bron! Bron,for pity's sake, why 
don't you reply? 

He made no answer. The blood 
from his forehead trickled down 
his face and ran salty into his 
mouth. Soon the shock and the 
pain forced him from his reverie 
and pressed on him a brutal ac-

ceptance qf his. environment. For 
the first time he showed, an aware- 
ness of the holocaust. He looked 
out across the flickering waste of 
the tormented city, agony and com- 
prehension filtering across his torn 
brow. 

Bron,for God*s sake answer, 

T he sky flared suddenly green 
and hideous as the Yagi’s 
beams found and detonated an un- 
known arsenal. The blast from the 
explosion damned the building as a 
sanctuary and only instinct flung 
him clear. The walls between which 
he had been sheltering broke apart 
and the door against which he had 
pressed his back seconds before 
was buried deep under a murder- 
ous pile of masonry. 

Bron, are you receiving me at 
all? 

“I hear you.” In clear ground 
on the square he stopped and 
forced himself to speak, his voice 
ragged with undertones of near 
hysteria. “Where are you? I can 
hear you, but I can’t see you.” 
Jupiter! The voice was aghast. 
No! You have to be joking! Six 
years and a quarter of the Com- 
mando budget were needed to 
place you where you are — and now 
you feign amnesia. Bron, you 
must be joking! 

“I never felt less like joking. I 
feel sick. Who are you — if you’re 
not imagination?” 

Steady, Bron, steady. The big 
blast must have given you a con- 



cussion. You re in a bad way by 
the sound of things. / had to use 
the semantic trigger to pull you 
out of that coma. Is there nothing 
you remember at all? 

“Nothing. I don’t know who I 
am — or who you are. You seem to 
be speaking in my head. Am I hav- 
ing hallucinations?” 

Far from it. This all has a ra- 
tional explanation. Only your 
memory is faulty. 

“Where am I?” 

In the city of Ashur on the plan- 
et Onaris. It’s under attack by De- 
stroyer ships. 

“And you hear me. How do you 
hear me? Where are you?” 

Jupiter! This gets worse. We 
don’t have time for explanations 
now. First you have to get clear of 
the square and find a place to rest. 
I’ll explain later if your memory 
doesn’t come back. For the mo- 
ment you’ll have to take what I 
say on trust. 

“And if I don’t?” 

Don’t dare me, Bron. There’s 
too much at stake. If you could 
remember what you were — and 
why you are there — you’d know 
better than to ask the question. 
Don’t make me show you why. 

Bron pressed his head into his 
hands for a full half minute, then 
straightened. 

“Very well. I accept that for the 
moment. What do you want me to 
do?” 

Move out of the city center. The 
damage won’t be quite so bad on

the perimeter. On the other side of 
the square, as you now face it, is a 
thoroughfare. Follow that until / 
tell you where to turn. 77/ stay 
with you. 

Bron shrugged and followed the 
instruction, fully aware now of the 
blistering fury shrieking out of the 
sky. The ship above was obviously 
preparing for a landing, ploughing 
for itself a stabilizing furrow deep 
in the flesh of the city and savage- 
ly eliminating all resistance in the 
areas surrounding. The relative 
absence of population in the at- 
tack area suggested that the atroc- 
ity had not been unannounced. A 
rising scream to the east told of 
where yet another spatial dread- 
nought had decided to make plan- 
etfall. Something about the pattern 
stirred a thread of Bron’s memory, 
but its pursuit eluded him. 



C AUTIOUSLY he picked his 
way around the edge of the 
square, finding an unknown talent 
for making the maximum use of 
cover against the devastating Ya- 
gis. On the far side he found the 
thoroughfare, once one of the 
proudest streets of Ashur, now a 
hulk-lined valley of debris, rimmed 
with fire. 

“You there in my head — are 
you listening?” 

We re always listening. 

“How do you listen?” 

Youve a bio-electronic trans- 
ducer implanted in your brain. Our 



equipment is such that we can hear 
you and speak to you no matter 
where you go. 

Bron absorbed this in silence for 
a moment. 

“Who are you?” 

Associates in war. I’m Doctor 
Veeder. Does the name mean noth- 
ing still? 

“Yes.” 

It will come to you. And Jaycee 
and Ananias. We three will be 
your unseen companions, as we 
have been in the past. We’re all 
part of the same team. 

“What team?” 

Special Assignments group at- 
tached to the Stellar Commando. 

“Ah—” 

You recall something? 

“I recollect vaguely that I was a 
Commando — but not here. Terra 
I remember, Delhi and Europa. I 
can’t recall anything after I left 
Europa.” 

That’s significant. It was when 
you left Europa that you started 
these special assignments. I don’t 
wonder your psyche chose that 
point to start forgetting . Watch 
out! 

Bron moved. The cautionary 
word and his own instinctive reac- 
tions coincided completely. A 
probing Yagi beam shattered the 
road surface inches before his feet. 
The backwash of the flux discharge 
caught him as he turned, flung him 
sideways, stunned but relatively 
unhurt. As the beam sliced on 
through a yet unbroken colonnade

IF 




he regained his feet, still shaking 
with reactive shock. 

“You — ” 

Whafs the matter, Bron? Are 
you hurt? 

“You saw that Yagi coming. 
How?” Bron was breathing hard. 

Yes, / saw it. Vve been trying to 
break this to you gently, since the 
relearning of the facts may be 
something of a traumatic shock in 
your present condition. 

“Spool the riddles! Can you see 
me, also?” 

Not see you — we see through 
your eyes and we listen through 
your ears. Day and night we watch 
and listen to every facet of your 
experience— Jaycee, Ananias, and 
myself That's our job. We can al- 
so speak to you and you cant shut 
us out. Our voices are transmitted 
directly to your brain. We can do 
a few other things, too, but we'll 
go into those later. For now, just 
follow my instructions. We'll find 
you a place to rest. 

“Very well.” 

Bron accepted the order with 
resignation. He was in no fit state 
mentally to compose an opposi- 
tion to the voice within his head. 
Physically he was drained and 
shaken and desperately in need of 
rest. He withdrew into himself and 
followed the instructions mechani- 
cally, gradually wending his way 
into darker corners of the broken 
streets and away from the focal 
point of the attack. Finally the 
voice seemed to cease. Unable to 



proceed farther of his own volition, 
he kicked a few bricks from under 
his feet, sank down to the dusty 
ground and slept. 

44¥¥OW^S Bron now?” 

-Tlof the trio, the speaker 
was the only one in civilian clothes 
— a simple jet-black sheath which 
detracted nothing from her femi- 
ninity. Her strong features were 
framed by raven hair garnished 
with self-luminous star-spite span- 
gles. Her full lips rivaled her deep 
eyes in expressing the contemptu- 
ous force of her character. 

Her question was addressed to 
the Medic-commander who turned 
away from the ranked screens. 
Dr. Veeder, tall and graying, bore 
the air of a man who had seen all 
the worst of life and learned to 
come to terms with it. Even at the 
end of his shift at the screens his 
crisp commando uniform, like his 
brow, showed no hint of other than 
authorized creases. 

“He’s still out, Jaycee, but as 
far as I can judge it’s a perfectly 
natural sleep.” He glanced back at 
the monitors, examining the puls- 
ing waveforms. “It should be safe 
to wake him in about an hour.” 

“Damn him. If he’s loused up 
this project I’ll give him such hell 
he’ll wish his mother had been a 
compulsive virgin.” 

“Don’t climb on his back too 
heavily when he first wakes. He 
took a considerable blasting last 
night. I don’t think he’ll appreciate

the subtlety of your advances — and 
anyway, this happens to be an, ex- 
ercise in cooperation, not coer- 
cion. Ride him the way you usual- 
ly do and you could very easily put 
him on the defensive.” 

“I’d make sure he didn’t survive 
it.” 

“Agreed — but that’s not the 
point. He has to survive if we’re 
going to get the information we 
need.” 

She accepted the point sullenly. 
Veeder left the screens and reached 
for his cloak. 

“He’s all yours, Jaycee. I’m go- 
ing to get some sleep. Call me if 
anything unusual happens.” 

“Engaged.” Jaycee slipped into 
the padded control couch in front 
of the screens and reached back to 
draw the curtains partly shut to 
kill the reflections in the cubicle. 
Then she began to run a routine 
check of the controls to ensure 
that she was familiar with their 
standing state. 

The third member of the trio 
prized himself loose from the seat 
of the computer console as Veeder 
departed. Throughout the preced- 
ing conversation he had remained 
silent, his eyes never once leaving 
Jaycee. Now he came to stand di- 
rectly behind her, watching the 
manifold screens as she trimmed 
and adjusted their symbolic leg- 
ends. The bright tabs of his uni- 
form proclaimed him a full Com- 
mand General and contrasted odd- 
ly with his apparent youth, his 



flaxen hair and pallid complexion. 
His eyes were curiously, bright and 
he moistened his small, pink lips 
continuously with a small, pink 
tongue. 

“Doc’s right, you know, honey- 
bitch,” he said quietly. “No good 
lashing into Bron while he’s in that 
state. He won’t understand it and 
he may well go on the defensive. 
You know what a cuss Bron can 
be when he turns awkward.” He 
moved forward and leaned against 
the back of the control couch im- 
mediately behind her. His hands 
hovered only slightly above her 
shoulders. 

“Jet off, Ananias,’’ she said 
tiredly. “When I want your ideas 
on how to handle Bron I’ll ask for 
them.” 

“Sure, honey-bitch. Play it your 
way. I just thought that as you 
couldn’t have an emotional work- 
out on Bron you might be looking 
elsewhere for relief.” His hands 
moved on subtly to her bare neck, 
lingering. 

She froze. 

“What you askin’ for, Ananias? 
A couple of broken wrists?” 

“Honey-bitch — you would not 
dare try that on me.” His voice 
held an undercurrent of danger. 

“In three seconds if you don’t 
take your hands away.” 

“You’re teasing, honey-bitch.” 

She moved like a cobra, but he 
anticipated her action and had the 
additional advantage of operating 
from a standing position. He

IF 




broke her hold and pinioned her 
hands against the couch. 

“My God, you tried it, too,” 
He sounded a trifle shaken. 
“You’re a vicious devil, aren’t 
you?” 

“You should know, Ananias. 
You been around long enough.” 
“Too long, perhaps. That’s how 
I know the time to proposition. 
You can’t live through Bron for 
very long without breaking.” 



M omentarily her head 

turned to the big screen on 
which, when he was awake, the 
scene viewed by Bron’s eyes was 
presented. Currently it was blank. 
The regular rhythm of Bron’s 
breathing and pulse came through 
a muted speaker against the muf- 
fled background rumble of war- 
fare. Various monitors picked up 
the sounds, separated and analyzed 
them and presented scan traces of 
their findings. In electronic repre- 
sentation was displayed as much 
information about one living indi- 
vidual as it was possible to trans- 
mit over the precarious trans- 
galactic bio-electronic transfer 
link. 

A stronger tie, however, existed 
between Bron, the agent, and Jay- 
cee, his operator. This was the rap- 
port formed by the close coupling 
of two minds sharing a common 
experience however differently pre- 
sented. When agent and operator 
were psychologically matched to 
form one complementary person- 
PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



ality, the coupling was tightened 
even further. Sometimes intoler- 
ably. 

Jaycee faced up and tried to 
look at Ananias. “You know what 
that does to me, don’t you — livin’ 
through him?” 

Ananias kept control of her 
hands warily. “Sure. That’s how I 
know when you’re ripe for an emo- 
tional climbdown. Some time 
you’ve got to give way — else 
you’re going to crack.” 

“And you hang around hopin’ 
to collect whatever it is I have to 
give?” 

Her voice was edged like a ra- 
zor. 

“Sure, honey-bitch. I’m a con- 
noisseur. What you have to give is 
something of an acquired taste. 
You’ve a streak of tigerine spite 
which has no business this side of 
hell and you have to work it off 
on somebody. Well — a man could 
get addicted to that sort of thing.” 

“And you think you’re deservin’ 
of special privileges?” 

“I always give good service.” 

“Look, Ananias, I admit you 
once caught me off balance after 
Bron had wound me up. But that’s 
only because you happened to be 
the first livin’ thing down the corri- 
dor. It could have been anyone.” 

There was a long, uncomforta- 
ble silence. 

Then: “You don’t mean that, 
honey-bitch.” 

“Like hell I don’t. When I get 
that high I don’t care what I find 

11 




as long as it struggles. I don’t re- 
spond to propositions. I’m not 
looking for a lover — I’m lookin’ 
for somethin’ to help me catch up 
on a spell of suspended livin’. 
What I find doesn’t need any iden- 
tity — better he doesn’t have any. 
No matter what, there’s only one 
person I grapple with in the dark- 
ness.” 

The impasse between them was 
broken by the urgent summons of 
telltales on an auxiliary board. 
Ananias left her and was at the 
board in an instant. 

“Radio room, Jaycee. Report 
from the Antares transmitters. 
Come in, Antares. Ananias on 
line.” 

“Hullo, General! There’ ve been 
new developments on Onaris. To 
prevent further bloodshed, Onaris 
radio has just broadcast their gov- 
ernment’s acceptance of the De- 
stroyers’ unconditional surrender 
terms. Effective opposition to the 
Destroyers has now ceased.” 

“Good. Did the Onarian gov- 
ernment put out an appeal for out- 
side help?” 

“They started using their FTL 
transmitters as soon as the De- 
stroyers entered the system. They 
couldn’t expect to be heard except 
accidentally, of course, if there 
happened to be a starship within 
their range.” 

“Did you make radio contact 
with them?” 

“No. Our instructions were to 
the contrary. They could have no 



idea that our monitoring chain had 
picked them up.” 

“And nobody else answered 
their call?” 

“No one we could detect. Cer- 
tainly the FTL emergency bands 
were clear.” 

“Keep monitoring the emer- 
gency frequencies. If anyone shows 
sign of answering their appeal — 
jam them. It’s imperative that no- 
body interferes before the De- 
stroyers have taken what they want 
and pulled clear.” 

“Understood, General. We’ll 
report again if the situation 
changes.” 

Ananias broke the connection 
and turned back to Jaycee. 

“So far everything has gone as 
planned — except for Bron.” He 
frowned at the still vacant master 
screen. “The Destroyers have at- 
tacked, Onaris has given way, the 
entire Commando fleet is on yel- 
low alert — and the most expensive- 
ly prepared Commando agent in 
history occupies a strategic posi- 
tion in the middle of a raped city, 
snoring his bloody head off.” 

‘‘Not exactly your night, is it, 
Ananias?” 

“Don’t grieve for me, honey- 
bitch. You know I always win in 
the end. And if I have to wait a lit- 
tle, then the spoils of battle be- 
come all the more enjoyable.” 

“You’re a Godlost weaklin’, 
Ananias. Unprincipled, but a God- 
lost weaklin’.” 

She turned once more toward

IF 




the screens, this time purposefully 
studying the traces which told the 
details of Bron’s existence. Anan- 
ias moved back behind the couch. 
He knew better than to attempt to 
interfere with her now, as she ad- 
justed the microphone and herself 
and began to reestablish the rap- 
port she had with a sleeping Com- 
mando agent half a galaxy away. 

“Perhaps in the sordid cells of 
some inhuman inquisition . .” 
“Damn you for a bitch,” said 
Ananias quietly; 

II 

H IS rest was broken by the in- 
sistence of a voice. 

. , the mind mazed not by the 
searin steel, the nibblin’ 
nerve — but by a vaster wound . 

“Stop it — stop saying those 
things.” 

Get on your feet, Bron. Did you 
think you deserved a rest day? 

Bron stirred in the ruins, cruelly 
aware of the cold in his bones. The 
first pink of daybreak washed 
against the shattered skyline. His 
head ached and the wound on his 
temple was stiff with caked blood. 
With difficulty he rose to his feet, 
shivering and trying to orient his 
thoughts. 

“You in my mind — you’re not 
the one who spoke to me last 
night.” 

God — you should be so lucky as 
to forget me — The voice trailed in- 
to spiteful incredulity. No, Bron. 



This is Jaycee. Despite the re- 
straints imposed by the electronic 
transfer the voice was clearly fem- 
inine. Doc tells me you took a 
blastin’. How much do you re- 
member? 

“Almost nothing. What’s all this 
‘sick spite’ and ‘God is dying’ 
routine?” 

Hell, Doc was right. You are in a 
bad way. That phrasin’ is the 
semantic recall trigger geared into 
your subconscious. In any con- 
dition of lowered consciousness, 
from sleep through to coma, if you 
hear that you’ll have to respond. 
The wordin’ is meshed with the 
hypno-character synthesis which 
was impressed on your mind. 

“This gets insaner every minute. 
What’s this hypno-character 
thing?” 

An artificial character pattern 
impressed by ultra-deep hypnosis. 
It’s the character you have to be to 
pass the Destroyers. 

“But I don’t even know my own 
character, let alone the synthesis.” 

The fact you respond to the trig- 
ger means the synthesis is firm, 
You’ll react in the right way to a 
proper stimulus, even if you don’t 
understand your own actions. In a 
way your memory lapse is for- 
tunate. It’ll lessen the conflict be- 
tween the synthesis and the real 
you. God! It’s going to be well 
worth bearin’ you believin’ your- 
self to be a saint, Bron. 

The sarcasm in the voice bit 
deeply into his mind. 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS

**ls that what I’m supposed to 
be, Jaycee — a saint?” 

Rather a sort of electronic Tro~ 
jan Horse. But get to your feet, 
we\e work to do. The Destroyers 
have landed three ships around 
Ashur and their first move will be 
the imposition of Destroyer Law. 
That means a complete ban on all 
movements and absolute obedi- 
ence to their orders. We have to get 
you to the place you should have 
reached last night. 

Bron searched his mind for the 
things he should have known but 
had lost. “All this is way beyond 
me, Jaycee. I’d at least like to 
know the cause for which I’m be- 
ing martyred.” 

Ah, thaTs better — a touch of the 
old Bron irony. / dont have time to 
give you much now. Briefly, 
Canas Destroyer squadrons have 
increased the scope of their 
destruction to a point where they 
are threatening the Rim Depen- 
dencies themselves. We cant po- 
lice all that volume of space — and 
they*ve destroyed thirty-seven 
known planets in five years. Our 
only hope of stoppin them is to 
trace their baseworld and launch a 
massive attack on that. ThaTsyour 
job, Bron. The trick is to get you 
aboard a Destroyer ship in space 
for long enough to enable us to 
discover where the baseworld is. 

“And that’s quite a trick, I 
imagine.” 

If only you remembered! It*s 
taken us six years to get this far. 



First we had to build the giant 
transmitters in Antares to handle 
the communications transfer link 
between us and you over trans- 
galactic distances. It took two 
years of intelligence work to de- 
cide on the best way to attack the 
problem — and nearly a year de- 
veloping your cover. And lastly 
there was you — the kingpin of the 
whole operation. 

“Tell me about me, Jaycee.” 

Some other time, when Tm feel- 
ing really bitchy. Chaos, Bron, 
thaTs your forte — the sort of chaos 
that reaches out and affects every- 
one and everythin it touches. ITs 
the one part of your own character 
we*ve left unattenuated by the 
synthesis. It may be the one trait 
which can bring this mission 
through. 

Bron considered this in silence. 
Then: “What do I have to do 
first?” 

We*ve got to fit you into the 
background so when the 
Destroyers find you, they wont 
suspect you dont belong. We had a 
comprehensive cover worked out, 
but you should have been in 
position last night. 

“Why should the Destroyers 
want to find me?” 

Because you re substitutin for a 
man they came to Onaris to find. 
Look, Til have to fill in the details 
as we go. But listen to me, 
Bron — this is important — play the 
game exactly as we give it to you 
and rely on the synthesis for con-

tinuity ^Don t try any fool stunts of 
your own— if you do you re cer- 
tain to get killed. We*ve lost more 
than enough men already just 
placin you where you are. 

“Which way should I go?” 

T he sky was gradually growing 
lighter with the muddy grays of 
dawn and the vaguest hints of color 
were substantiating the shadows. 

Get out on the thoroughfare and 
get me a few place names. Once we 
can pinpoint your position 77/ have 
the computer give us a route. Then 
find a mirror and let me look at 
you. You’re goin to need to be 
right in character if we’re to get 
away with this. 

Bron shrugged and surveyed the 
broken walls which had given him 
partial shelter for the night. Part of 
the building farther back was rel- 
atively undamaged and it was to 
this he turned. The building 
proved deserted and the haste of 
the panicky exodus was under- 
scored by the pattern of disorder 
in the dim rooms and hallways. 
He finally found a mirror-cov- 
ered door. He opened and ad- 
justed it to make maximum use of 
the available light. 

“So that’s me—” 

Don’t you even remember what 
your face is like? 

“I couldn’t have called it to 
memory. Do I fit, Jaycee?” 

Not good. You’ll have to clean 
that cut on your forehead. We can’t 



risk sepsis this early in the game. 

“I’ll clean it somehow. Any- 
thing else?” 

No — except that I can’t get used 
to your looking like a damned 
angel. That’s the psychosomatic 
effect of the personality syn- 
thesis. 

“And what do you propose I do 
about it?” He was irritated by the 
malice in her voice. 

Don’t spoil it, Bron. It’ll wear 
off all too soon. No psycho- 
synthesis yet devised could ob- 
scure the real you for very long. 

He found street names for Jay- 
cee to work on. His wound he 
cleansed with water he found in a 
cistern and he brushed away as 
much of the caked mud and blood 
from his cloak as he could man- 
age. Then he returned to the mir- 
rored door to study the effect of his 
ablutions. 

He could not remember don- 
ning his clothes, but they consisted 
of a simple cloak of coarse weave 
and equally spartan under- 
garments. About his neck hung a 
well-worn crucifix of gold on a fine 
gold chain. A Bible in one of the 
ample pockets of the cloak ap- 
peared to complete his worldly 
possessions. 

As Jaycee had said, his face had 
acquired a pious intensity — it al- 
most shone from the youthful lines. 
He studied his features carefully, 
remembering them vaguely, yet not 
quite sure how different they had 
been prior to the hypno-synthesis. 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS

He was quietly proud of the 
strength and character he found in 
the jaw and brow, but something 
diabolical seemed to lurk behind 
the eyes — in depths that at once 
frightened and fascinated him. 

When youve finished your Nar- 
cissistic orgy rve got the route for 
you. 

Jaycee’s voice came so unex- 
pectedly that it made him jump. 
He had the feeling she had been 
watching him in the mirror 
through his own eyes for some 
time. The tightness of the surveil- 
lance irked him. Something deep 
inside him clawed for freedom, 
like a wild beast confined in too 
small a cage. His expression must 
have given away his unvoiced 
emotion, for she picked up the 
thought with uncanny accuracy. 

Don’t say it, Bron. You’re going 
to have to live with me inside you 
for quite a whiles It’s a situation 
I’ve come to enjoy — bein’ under- 
neath your flesh. 

“Bitch.” 

She laughed. 

Yes, I’m that, Bron, and most of 
the other things you’ve called me in 
the past. But now you’d better 
start travelin’. I’ll give you spot di- 
rections from whatever land- 
marks we can still identify. 

Her instructions directed him to- 
ward a region where the receding 
night was being shredded by the 
mottled gray-green erosion of re- 
fraction-scattered sunlight. Here 
even Onaris’s famous polychro- 



matic dawn seemed smeared with 
daubs of blood. 

The ruins were unnaturally still 
and apparently devoid of life. In- 
stinctively he felt to release his 
sidearm. Instead his fingers 
touched only on the Bible in his 
pocket; the discovery brought a 
twist of taut amusement to his 
lips. He looked at his hands. The 
nails were satisfactorily long and 
the muscles and flesh were hard. 

He said, “Jaycee, I know what I 
have to fight with, but what am I 
supposed to do with the book?” 

For once she did not answer, 
though he felt she was listening. 
Her silence brought a harsh re- 
alization of the seriousness of his 
situation. On this mission the 
synthesis and the book were all 
the weapons he was going to get. 



S MOKE from still-burning 
buildings drifted in broad fronts 
across his path and Bron trod cau- 
tiously, fearing that his sudden 
emergence from a veil of smoke 
could lead to his being shot by 
some observer moved too sudden- 
ly to action. Nevertheless he 
obeyed the instruction implicit 
in Jaycee’s directions and kept 
strictly to the middle of the road- 
way, making no attempt at con- 
cealment. 

“It’s too damn quiet, Jaycee. 
Where are all the people?” 

Total evacuation, Bron. The De- 
stroyers have imposed an abso- 



rb 



IF 




lute clearance of a five-kilometer 
radius around each landing site. 
Turn around in a full circle, will 
you. I want to take a check on your 
position. 

Bron turned slowly on one heel, 
following the skyline with his 
eyes and dwelling on any features 
of the broken terrain that might be 
construed as landmarks. 

“On course?” 

Near enough. Just clear of the 
Destroyers' five-kilometer perim- 
eter, but still in the evacuated zone. 
Your main danger is the Ashur po- 
lice, who may come looking for 
looters. Stay in the open and keep 
your hands empty and in view. 

“Shouldn’t I be going toward the 
ship?” 

You re jokin! Cross that 
perimeter and you re a dead man. 
The only way anyone gets through 
there is if the Destroyers choose 
to take him. 

“And you think they’ll choose to 
take me?” 

We*re hopeful. You re to imper- 
sonate a key Onaris technocrat. 
You were due at the Ashur Semi- 
nary last night, but the Destroy- 
ers struck before we could get you 
there. 

“What the hell would the De- 
stroyers want with technocrats?” 

They take anything thaTs any 
value to them — brains, slave-flesh, 
metals. And as many items of 
higher technology as they can 
find. ThaTs why they put down an 
entire fleet. They strip a planet of 



anything useful they can carry be- 
fore they destroy it. 

“That doesn’t make sense, Jay- 
cee. 

No, but it's fact. 

“Slave-flesh and metals 1 can 
understand, but not techno- 
crats. They can surely train 
enough of their own.” 

They appear to be concentrating 
on ones with a certain special- 
ty — authorities on the patterns 
of chaos. Seems as though Onaris 
had one of the top men in that field. 

“I thought Terra had all the top 
men.” 

ThaTs a classical myth. In fact, 
the reverse is true. When the star- 
ships started the Great Exodus 
from Terra they took an unusual- 
ly high concentration of very 
high IQ emigrants with them. It*s 
not rare on a settlement planet to 
find two or three families still 
breedin' an almost pure genuis 
strain. Onaris had one family of 
decidedly genius strain — the 
Halterns. You re cast as Ander 
Haltern, direct ninth descendant 
of Prosper Haltern. AndeYs 
probably one of the galaxy* s top 
men on the patterns of chaos. 

“What happened to the original 
Ander?” 

On Terra, cooperating with us. 
We took him off secretly six 
months ago. The story*s been 
patched to support your appear- 
ance in Ashur just now. By the 
way, by Onaris custom, one*s fa- 
miliar name is not on official

record, scf you re still at liberty to 
call yourself Bron. I advise you to 
do so. That split-second* s hesita- 
tion in respondin to an unaccus- 
tomed name could be crucial in an 
emergency, 

Bron suddenly stopped. “Voices, 
Jaycee.” 

Where? 

“Beyond the smoke in front.” 
Yes, I hear them now, A police 
roadblock, I should imagine. Def- 
initely native Onaris-Ashur ac- 
cent, 

“You can hear all that?” 

When necessary we can apply a 
lot more gain to the signal from 
your ears than you can. Youve got 
to go through there, Bron. Let the 
synthesis take over your respons- 
es. Dont try to override it. If you 
do you re likely to come out with a 
few pure Bron-type answers and 
reactions — and that could lead to 
a fairly rapid termination of the 
project. 

A S HE cleared the smoke he 
could see what had once been a 
line of stone-clad buildings, now a 
mere complex wall, castellated 
by fire and blast. The road contin- 
ued haphazardly through the 
ruins and a barrier had been set 
across the track. On this were post- 
ed men in the green uniforms of 
the Ashur civil police. 

“Stay or we fire.” The sudden 
voice was electronically rein- 
forced. 

Bron halted. He saw no possi- 



bility of avoiding or withdraw- 
ing from the encounter. The sand 
exploded just before his feet, de- 
fining a safe distance for his 
movements. An officer threw a 
voice amplifier into the interven- 
ing space. 

“Approach the apparatus and 
speak.” 

Bron moved cautiously towards 
the amplifier, his hands up- 
stretched and his eyes on the un- 
wavering stubs of the weapons 
centered on his body. He inward- 
ly saluted the police technique of 
maintained distance. Even had he 
possessed his full Commando 
equipment he could not have 
hoped to get a gas slug or shock 
pellet through to the barrier with- 
out drawing fire, 

“What are you doing in the 
evacuated zone?” The amplifier 
impressed the officer’s tones with 
a sinister metallic burr. 

“Trying to get out.” Bron’s nat- 
ural resistance to authority pro- 
duced a spontaneous reply that 
forestalled any answer the syn- 
thesis might have prompted. The 
amplifier carried his words back 
to echo quickly against the broken 
walls. 

“I see.” The amplifier was criti- 
cal and unamused. 

Fool! You askin to get killed? 
Jaycee’s anger burst in his head 
so clearly that he found it nearly 
impossible to believe that the 
amplifier would not pick it up and 
hurl her words across the inter- 



18 



IF 




veiling space. Play it his way, you 
stupid cretin! 

“You heard the evacuation order 
last night. You know we dare not 
offer any resistance to the De- 
stroyers?” 

Yes, prompted Jaycee. 

“Yes,” said Bron. 

“Then you know our instructions 
are to shoot on sight anyone found 
in the zone. Have you any reason 
to offer why that instruction should 
not be carried out?” The men at 
the barrier sighted their weapons 
and prepared to fire. 

Jaycee’s voice was a flurry: Pve 
checked his rank, Bron. He*s a 
senior enough animal to be able to 
exercise discretion — and soft as 
hell, else he wouldn't bother to 
talk. Ride the synthesis, damn 
you! 

“I am Ander Haltern, called 
Bron, late to adopt my residency 
at the Seminary of the Sacred 
Relic.” With a shock Bron real- 
ized that it was his own voice 
speaking, but the words and the 
tone were derived straight from 
the post-hypnotic suggestion. In- 
trigued, he let his mind and tongue 
freewheel. “How else can I reach 
my destination, save through 
your barrier?” 

“Haltern?” There was a moment 
of consternation among the 
police at the roadblock, and the 
amplifier was swiftly muted to 
mask a hasty conversation. The 
Haltern name obviously carried 
a great deal of weight. 



The officer spoke again. 

“Can you prove your identity?” 
“Is that necessary for a Haltern 
in Ashur?” The synthesis tight- 
ened his tone into intolerant 
sharpness. 

“You have a letter of introduc- 
tion, perhaps?” 

“No letter.” A temporary anger 
welled up inside him and he made 
a mental note of the shortness of 
Ander’s temper. “What does a 
Haltern want with paper?” 

“Then any other means — ” 

“If you can’t take my word, you 
must come and see for yourself. 
Here is all I have.” 

With a savage gesture Bron 
stripped the cloak from his shoul- 
der and let it fall to the ground. His 
undergarments followed, and 
then, completely naked, he 
stalked back to the edge of the 
smoke and waited. 

Well clear of the amplifier he 
spoke softly. “Hell, Jaycee, this is 
weird. It’s unnerving not to know 
how you’re going to act until 
you’ve done it.” 

But you see how the synthesis 
works, Bron. It responds with a 
complete takeover of your reac- 
tions when a direct stimulus such 
as a question or a situation de- 
mands it. 

“If it includes an impromptu 
striptease every time I’m asked for 
my identity, this is one synthesis 
that has definitely no future.” 
Jaycee was highly amused. 
There's no tellin what you may

do. Ander Haltern is a highly 
individual character. But what 
worries me is your rapid relaxa- 
tion out of the synthetic char- 
acter. It suggests the synthesis 
isnt set any too firmly. 77/ have to 
put Doc on it when he comes on 
duty. 

The officer, bearing only a 
sidearm, came forward and turned 
the clothes over with his foot. At 
last he found the Bible and picked 
it up. Then he held out his hand. 

“My apologies, Bron Ander 
Haltern — but you see, we cannot 
be too careful. These are very 
critical times.” His eyes wan- 
dered apprehensively in the di- 
rection of the Destroyer ship. 
His face was almost gray with 
worry. 

Bron dismissed him curtly. “Can 
you arrange transport to the 
Seminary?” 

“Of course, Bron Haltern. I will 
see to it immediately.” 

The officer returned to the 
barrier and Bron turned back to his 
clothes. He could hear Jaycee’s 
outward amusement as he re- 
trieved the garments and solemn- 
ly dressed. 

7/5 just occurred to me. Jaycee 
was triumphant. Perhaps thaPs 
how you re supposed to use the 
book, Bron. You take off your 
clothes and sulk. 

He said, “Damn you, Jaycee,” 
contriving not to move his lips 
and in a mere breath of a voice 
which the amplifier could not pos- 



sibly pick up. Jaycee responded 
with a peal of laughter. 

“You heard that?” asked Bron 
quietly at the next opportunity. 

If I hadnt — Vd have guessed. 
But you dont need to vocalize. 
We can pick up subvocal speech 
just as well. You should be able to 
communicate with us in full view 
of other persons without their be- 
ing aware of it. 

“You’ve got all the damn an- 
swers, haven’t you?” 

More than you re aware of, 
Bron. And on this assignment 
Vve got you dancin like a puppet, 
because you dont remember just 
how sharp some of those answers 
are. 

Ill 

T he scudder placed at his dis- 
posal was a typical heavy-duty 
vehicle, brutally functional and 
highly articulate. Under cover of 
the jet scream and out of direct 
sight of the driver, Bron practiced 
subvocal communication. 

“Can you read me, Jaycee?” 
The action was no more than 
thinking the words and allowing 
the muscles of his throat to per- 
form their customary actions but 
without the aspiration necessary 
to produce a sound. 

Loud and clear, Bron. 

“What was it about the book 
that convinced him I’m Haltern?” 

7 think because it*s an old Ter- 
ran Authorized Version — very 



20 



IF 




rare on a dependency world. Only 
an intellectual like Haltern could 
be expected to understand it, 

“Bit of a queer bird, this Hai- 
tern character.” 

But brilliant. He’s a master syn- 
cretist — probably one of the best 
alive today, 

“What’s a syncretist?” 

One who works across the chan- 
nels of scientific specialization 
rather than along them. To qual- 
ify for mastership you need at 
least ten honors degrees in unre- 
lated subjects and the proven abil- 
ity to think freely across the lines 
of the various disciplines as well 
as with them. 

The scudder banked swiftly and 
Bron, restraining an instant of 
vertigo from sudden awareness 
of the unexpected height they had 
attained, looked down at the vast 
edifice below them. 

“What’s that, Jaycee?” 

Ashur Seminary, More cor- 
rectly, the Seminary of the Sacred 
Relic of Ashur, That’s where the 
Destroyers will expect to find 
you. 

The scudder burned its way 
down through the clear air of the 
morning and drove to an unpol- 
ished finish before the great por- 
tals. Bron Ander Haltern alighted, 
obeyed the synthesis-keyed instinct 
which forbade him even to ac- 
knowledge the driver’s presence 
and ascended the great steps of the 
Seminary. As he did so he felt the 
mantle of the synthetic character 



closing around him, entrapping 
him in the shadowy web of some- 
body else’s mores and reactions. 
Again the beast that was in him 
clawed out piteously for freedom. 

Nobody awaited him. The vesti- 
bule led to a corridor and then to a 
farther door. Beyond this he found 
a vast and vaulted hall lit only by 
the sunlight entering through 
strangely stained and patterned 
windows. He stopped suddenly, 
entranced by the space and unity 
of the edifice. The great columns 
that rose to support the beautiful 
roof were clustered with carved 
figurines and statuettes depict- 
ing scenes which casually had no 
meaning for him. The walls were 
similarly complex and ornate, 
obviously endowed with the same 
rich symbolism. 

The synthesis guided his feet 
across the floor and down the cen- 
tral aisle between stone blocks ar- 
ranged as though for seats. At the 
far end, between white alcoves set 
into the wall, stood a bare dais. 
Behind it was a shield em- 
blazoned with the sun-disk symbol 
of Ashur and centrally in the 
shield, nailed cruciform, hung the 
sacred relic — a replica of a small, 
brown, furry quadruped. Around 
the shield hypnotic stereo-color 
tablets spelled out the single word: 

GLADLY 

“Is this some kind of church, 
Jaycee?” 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



21 




Some kind. But not the sort you 
find on Terra. Not quite that sort 
of religion either — though they 
do claim their God is the same. 

Bron turned and studied more 
closely the figurines on the col- 
umns closest to him. He heard Jay- 
cee’s sharp intake of breath. 

Move closer, Bron. This is inter- 
estin. 

“What is it? A monument to De 
Sade?” 

No. An expression of faith. Mor- 
tification of the body for the edi- 
fication of the soul. In the Semi- 
nary the cultivation of mind and 
spirit is all. The body is regarded 
merely as a vessel of atonement 
for the weaknesses of the other 
two. 

“Jaycee, that’s sick.” 

It*s their way of life. The col- 
umns are supposed to depict the 
classical two hundred and fifty- 
six modes of penance for weak- 
ness. 

“After some of those penances 
there wouldn’t be anything left to 
be weak with.” 

Subvocalize, Bron. There*s 
someone coming. 

B ron scanned the hall swiftly, 
but no one was yet in sight. His 
gaze fell again on the sacred relic, 
whose button-bright and twisted 
stare suddenly typified the dis- 
torted philosophy portrayed by 
the figurines. The act triggered 
something in the hypnosynthe- 



sis and against his conscious will 
he dropped to his knees, hands 
clasped before him, in an attitude 
of prayer and supplication. 

The footsteps closed behind 
him. 

“Ander Haltern?” 

“The same.” Bron rose and 
turned to face the questioner. 

“What will be your familiar?” 

“Bron.” 

The preceptor — the hypnosyn- 
thesis identified the other’s func- 
tion — was lean, gray, ascetic and 
unwelcoming. “We expected you 
yesterday, Bron Ander Haltern. 
How do you answer?” 

“Ashur was destroyed by the 
raiding and I nearly with it.” 

“You allowed the trivia of the 
times to come before your duty?” 

“Trivia? You damn — ” Bron 
overrode the acquiescent syn- 
thesis. 

Steady, Bron. 

“Bron Haltern, having achieved 
mastership, you have the priv- 
ilege of choosing your own pen- 
ance for absence. What do you 
offer?” 

“What do I answer, Jaycee? The 
synthesis gives me nothing.” Sub- 
vocally he could form the words 
faster than he could have spoken. 

Stall him. This wasnt pro- 
gramed. Tm contactin Ander. 

“Ashur is nearly in ruins,” said 
Bron aloud. “The Destroyers are 
in control. Outside these walls no- 
body has right of movement or 
even right of life. Do you still de-

IF 




mand panance from one detained 
by such events?” 

“Bron Ander Haltern.” The 
preceptor’s face was grave. His 
eyes were tinged with a depth of 
irrationality. “You disappoint 
me. That is not the reaction one 
has learned to expect from a Hal- 
tern. Come, make your offer — or 
1 shall impose one of my own.” 

The shirt, Bron. 

“The shirt,” said Bron. 

The preceptor’s eyes widened 
abruptly and his jaw dropped. 
“Forgive me! I meant no disre- 
spect to the Halterns. There is no 
need—” 

The synthesis swung Bron 
wrathfully. “Are you questioning 
my decision. Preceptor?” 

“Of course not.” The precep- 
tor’s eyes mirrored agony and 
embarrassment. “It’s just that the 
act does not warrant such a level 
of penance. I must ask you again, 
are you sure you’re, prepared to 
accept the shirt?” 

“Gladly.” The word rose spon- 
taneously from the synthesis. 

The preceptor shrugged re- 
signedly. “Very well. I shall con- 
duct you to your cell. The shirt will 
be delivered to you there.” 

Bron follow^ the preceptor out 
of the hall by a minor door, then 
through a series of corridors, each 
similarly ugly and depressing 
with a severity of line which made 
no concession to the human need 
for contrast and relief. The occa- 
sional doors were dark, square and 



massive, with small, high, shut- 
tered windows. 

“Jaycee, this is more like a pri- 
son than a seminary.” 

On Onaris there's little to 
choose between them. Education 
is inseparable from religion and 
religion from austerity and disci- 
plined penance. The only thing 
about the system that stands in its 
favor is that it produces some 
remarkably good scholars. Twist- 
ed but brilliant. 

“I can imagine. And what the 
hell’s the shirt?” 

Don't know. It was Ander' s 
idea. He seemed to think it appro- 
priate to the crime. He's getting 
quite a kick out of the idea. 

The preceptor reached a door 
and halted. The proximity lock re- 
sponded unhesitatingly to his fin- 
gers and the heavy wood swung 
open. Bron, though accustomed to 
a lifetime of utilitarian Com- 
mando accommodation, stood 
appalled. The cell he was invited 
to enter was a featureless stone 
box. The only attempt at furnish- 
ing was the provision of a solitary 
coffin-sized slab of cut white 
stone, which presumably had to 
serve as table, chair and bed. 
There was nothing else at all. 

A solitary eye of unalterable 
light stared down harshly from the 
ceiling. The aperture through 
which it entered was encircled by 
the gilded message: 

GLADLY 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS

The preceptor was watching his 
face, but Bron managed to remain 
impassive. 

“In a few minutes, Bron 
Haltern, I will send you the shirt. I 
suggest you don it immediately, 
then you will not be unduly late in 
conducting your first tutorial.” 

“Is the penance then not to wait 
until the evening service?” 

“No. You have earned greater 
respect than that. I think your 
absolution will be more perfect if 
the work of the shirt is well ad- 
vanced by the time you bear wit- 
ness to the assembly.” 

Under the influence of the syn- 
thesis, Bron bowed his head and 
waited until the preceptor had 
departed. 

“That man’s not only a sadist, 
Jaycee, he’s also quite mad. He 
took in absolutely nothing of 
what I told him about the destruc- 
tion of Ashur. His world begins 
and ends in a small closed circle of 
Seminary rites. How long do I 
have to stay here?” 

Not long, I guess. The Destroy- 
ers always know where to look for 
the people they want. They must 
put in some damn good intelli- 
gence work before they strike. 

“Am I the only one they’re look- 
ing for?” 

We think so. They*ll otherwise 
take mainly slave-flesh. They're 
obviously colonizin'. Human 
flesh is a lot cheaper and more 
versatile than machinery on an 
undeveloped world. 



“Interesting point. The flesh- 
ships were not unknown even in 
the days of Terr an space coloni- 
zation.” 

Bron broke off as a knock on the 
door heralded the arrival of a stu- 
dent bearing the shirt. The stu- 
dent slipped the garment from its 
filmy wrap and left it on the slab. 
As he passed and bowed, his eyes 
bore a look compounded both of 
admiration and profound sym- 
pathy. 

B ron examined the shirt cau- 
tiously. It clung to his fingers 
as though each fiber of its wool-like 
texture were possessed of micro- 
scopic barbs. With swift decision 
he stripped and donned the gar- 
ment — and momentarily its hug- 
ging softness was almost luxur- 
ious. Its elasticity drew it 
smoothly over the contours of his 
body. A few seconds later he was 
genuinely praying, perhaps for 
the first time in his life. 

In something akin to mortal 
panic he tried to tear the shirt 
away from his body, but the myr- 
iad barbs of the fine, white fibers 
were firmly engaged in his flesh. 
There was no way of removal save 
that of tearing away the skin. The 
burning itch and panic drove him 
to the verge of hysteria before he 
managed to clamp a cold com- 
posure on his reasoning. 

“Jaycee, this is diabolical — ” 
Jaycee laughed. It's apparently 
the modern equivalent of the pil- 



24 



IF 




grimes hairshirt. Contemplation, 
concentration, and suffering* en- 
rich the mind and ennoble the spir- 
it. And let*s face it, Bron, both 
your mind and your spirit were 
long overdue for somethin dras- 
tic. Vm quite lookin forward to 
the improvement. 

“Damn you for a bitch, Jaycee. 
One day I’ll make you regret 
that.” 

A knock sounded at the door. It 
was the student again. 

“Mastership Haltern, sorry if I 
disturb your devotions. The 
preceptor requires me to conduct 
you to the Syncretics unit.” 

“It’s no disturbance,” said Bron. 
“I’ve already made my dedi- 
cation clear.” 

Outside the door the youth put 
his knuckles to his forehead. 
“You may lean on my arm if you 
wish. Mastership.” His eyes 
strayed to the shirt, the collar of 
which showed still above the cloak. 

“Thank you, no.” Bron de- 
clined as the synthesis demanded 
he must, but from the look in the 
youth’s eyes he knew that the shirt 
was infamous. 

As he walked, Bron could hear 
Jaycee cataloguing the way. His 
own consciousness was almost 
entirely absorbed by the unre- 
mitting and painful awareness of 
the shirt of penance and he was in 
no condition to master detail. At 
the door of the Syncretics unit the 
student saluted with knuckles to 
forehead as if in momentary 



prayer, then departed. Bron 
touched the proximity lock. After 
a few seconds’ trial the lock re- 
sponded and he entered the labor- 
atory to give his first-ever tutorial 
in syncretics. 

This time he was impressed. 
The array of teaching and com- 
puting equipment must have cost a 
fortune. His audience of a hun- 
dred, all working in solitary 
cells, had instant on-line access to 
the computer as well as real-time 
monitoring of their own re- 
sponses. The performance-anal- 
ysis display panel was a master- 
piece of ingenuity and enabled 
him to correct in seconds the 
failure of a student to grasp a sin- 
gle point or a single word. 

Faced with a specific demand, 
the stored knowledge in the char- 
acter synthesis produced all the 
information he needed. Yielding 
to the pressures of the synthesis, 
he allowed his hands to set up 
channels and controls, not 
properly understanding his ac- 
tions until the instant they had to 
be performed. Then, as he fol- 
lowed the movement of his fin- 
gers, he began to understand the 
instruments before him. His lec- 
ture, too, came readily to mind 
and he spoke first and compre- 
hended later. 

Such concentration served to di- 
vert his attention from the shirt, 
but the irritant pain of such an 
intimate and widespread pene- 
tration of the skin was a distrac- 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



25 




tion that permitted hiip only two 
states of mind — extreme concen- 
tration and abject despair. 
Moreover his body was reacting 
violently to the attack with an 
allergic rash that spread soon to 
his face and hands and produced 
an unwholesome puffmess around 
his eyes. 

“Jaycee, this shirt is killing me. 
Ask Ander how I get the damn 
thing off.” 

I already did. Short of extensive 
surgery there seems no way of re- 
movin it prematurely. The fibers 
are histamine sensitive. When the 
allergic reaction raises your body 
histamine to a sufficient level 
they will quit of their own accord. 

“And for God’s sake — how long 
will that take?” 

Depends on the susceptibility of 
the individual. Could take up to 
thirty-six hours. 

“I see,” said Bron grimly. 
“Have you asked friend Ander 
what proportion of its wearers die 
of shock?” 

Yes. About ten percent, Bron. 
If we*d known earlier wed never 
have let you put it on . " 

“Whose side is Ander on?” 

Ours apparently. He said the 
choice of the shirt was to keep you 
truly in the character of a Hal- 
tern. We overlooked the fact that 
most of the Haltern descendants 
are mad. 

T he tutorial lasted five hours, 
after which Bron returned to 



his cell. Agonizing though his 
hours in the tutorial had been, the 
work had at least partially taken 
his mind off the shirt. The leisure 
period offered no such distrac- 
tion. The allergic reaction of his 
body was assuming alarming 
proportions. Muscles in his arms 
and legs were beginning to react 
with pain and stiffness which told 
of the spread of toxins throughout 
the bloodstream. Occasionally he 
thought he detected the first 
fringes of delirium in his brain. 

For want of alternative, Bron lay 
painfully back on the stone slab 
and let the bright, unwinking eye 
of the solitary light glaze his de- 
liberately unblinking eyes. By vary- 
ing the range of his vision he could 
focus on the legend, GLADLY, 
or on the point-source of light or 
past both to infinity. As he neared 
the auto-hypnotic state he experi- 
enced slow alternations of light 
and darkness until finally he drift- 
ed into sleep. 

.. .in the sordid cells of some in- 
human inquisition a spirit 
snapped . 

“Spool it, Jaycee! What’s up?” 

Knock on the door, Bron. Two 
men outside. 

“Damn! I can’t go on much 
longer, Jaycee. If this thing doesn’t 
give up soon. I’ve had it.” 

Doc*s all but taking Ander 
apart try in to find out what the 
shirt's made of. The job isn't easy 
because native Onaris biology is 
obviously a field of its own. 



26 



IF 




Bron swung his feet painfully to 
the floor and attempted to stand. 
The stiffening ache in his joints at 
first defied his efforts, but grad- 
ually he persuaded his limbs to 
give him the necessary support. 
Like a sick man, he stood. 

The two men were dressed dif- 
ferently from either himself or 
from the students. Their light-yel- 
low tunics were obviously de- 
signed for ease of movement. 

“Mastership Haltern, it is time 
for you to take the place of witness 
at the evening assembly.” 

The synthesis flashed sharp 
disapproval into Bron’s mind. 
“Since when was it the custom to 
escort a penitant to his place?” 
The phrase was pure Haltern 
intolerance. 

“The preceptor insists — as an 
assurance of spiritual discipline.” 
“Discipline comes from within 
not by imposition. The precep- 
tor overreaches himself. I shall 
make my own way.” 

The wardens appeared momen- 
tarily uncertain of their position. 
Bron took advantage of the fact 
and steeled hirhself to walk ahead, 
shored up primarily by the syn- 
thesis-generated anger which 
fumed at the indignity of having a 
man’s most private hour of forti- 
tude supervised by wardens. 

He entered the church and 
crossed to the center aisle, turn- 
ing toward the sacred relic behind 
the dais. Some compulsion greater 
than his own will forced him to 



kneel and look upward at the crea- 
ture’s twisted stare. His knuckles 
sought his forehead. After sev- 
eral minutes thus he attempted to 
stand, but his stiffened legs defied 
him and he twisted and fell. 
Immediately the wardens were 
upon him. They carried him to 
one of the alcoves flanking the 
dais. Here rings had been provided 
to hold a man’s arms in such a 
position that even if he fainted, his 
body would still remain erect. To 
these he was fastened, facing down 
the body of the church. 

I N THE hour before the assem- 
bly arrived his consciousness 
slipped several times into a delir- 
ious half-sleep that was more like 
a lapse in time than any human 
condition. When he awoke, the as- 
sembly of staff and students had 
mainly entered and taken their 
places on the blocks of stone. The 
preceptor entered last, clad now 
in ceremonial dress like some ma- 
jestic cleric. He spared Bron and 
his misery only a fleeting glance. 
The service was long and tedious, 
full of responses and intricate 
psalms, and the sermons were dog- 
matic beyond reason. 

Bron, striving to combat the 
gulfs of blackness that inter- 
rupted his thinking, tried to gauge 
from the expressions of the as- 
sembly the true feelings of the 
individuals toward his plight. The 
dominant look was of interest 
and participation. Only a very

few, like the preceptor, were 
twisted with the basic streak of 
sadism. For the rest it was part of 
the accepted norm. 

Jaycee’s voice broke in with sud- 
den urgency. Bron, this is what 
weve been waitin for. We can hear 
the sound of heavy scudders movin 
in. We can expect the Destroyers 
at any moment. 

As if to verify her words, a long 
explosion rumbled through the 
corridors and resonated in the 
cavity of the hall. The preceptor 
faltered only slightly in his prayer, 
then continued. A second explo- 
sion, more staccato this time, shat- 
tered the inner door. 

An immediate panic was stilled 
as a group of armed soldiers 
rushed through the smoke-filled 
doorway. They deployed them- 
selves professionally across the 
end of the church, waiting only for 
some act on the part of the assem- 
bly to cause them to open fire. The 
preceptor’s words dribbled to a 
halt as he was faced with a reality 
he could not finally deny. 

“Who are you? What do you 
want? Don’t you know this is dedi- 
cated ground?” His voice echoed 
down the long hall, gathering 
timbre from the reverberations in 
the high, vaulted roof. It was un- 
thinkable to him that his world 
should be violated. 

The leading soldier spoke. “We 
’ave Destroyer business ’ere. 
Where is one they call Ander ’al- 
tern?” 



“He is here, making penance. I 
forbid him to speak.” 

“Quiet, old fool. It is I who give 
the orders.” To emphasize the 
point a multiple gunblast ripped 
out three of the stained-glass win- 
dows. “Let ’altern come out or it 
will be men we split, not glass.” 

“I warn you — ” The preceptor 
still had not grasped that his 
position was lost. “This behavior 
is sacrilegious. I demand that 
you leave.” 

A single shot through the head 
toppled the preceptor from the 
dais. His removal from the scene 
was so sudden that it was almost 
anticlimatic. 

“Ander ’altern.” Someone in 
the assembly at the back was 
being forced at weaponpoint to 
mark the quarry. The remaining 
raiders covered the assembly. 
Wisely, no resistance was offered. 
The Destroyer’s firepower was, as 
ever, more than adequate for a 
massacre. 

“Are you ’altern the syn- 
cretist?” The Destroyer leader 
stopped before Bron in the al- 
cove, frowning at the manacles 
and the lymph-soaked shirt. 

“The same.” 

“What they trying to do, kill 
you?” 

The question was rhetorical but 
carried a refreshing draught of 
sanity. The Destroyer released 
the rings holding Bron’s wrists and 
motioned him forward. Bron 
took one shocked step before his

IF 




knees buckled under him and he 
pitched headlong to the dais. In 
delirium and with clouding con- 
sciousness he sought to raise his 
body and stand, but his arms, too, 
were now unequal to the task. He 
found himself helpless, looking 
up at the twisted mockery in the 
stare of the sacred relic. 

“Jaycee — what the hell — is that 
thing called?” 

It's a Terran child* s play thin . A 
replica of somethin called a bear. 

“Does it always have those 
eyes?” 

No. A child must have played 
with it until its eye-buttons came 
loose. It*s said to have once be- 
longed to Prosper Haltern, 
founder both of the Onaris col- 
ony and of the Seminary. 

“Oh God — the eternal joke — ” 

You re delirious, Bron. Lie 
quietly, fm sending for Doc. 

“Damn you, Jayqee — don’t you 
see it? Gladly my cross I’d 
bear— damn — crosseyed bear — ” 

Stop talking, Bron. You re 
shoutin' aloud. You're . 

But Bron was almost laughing 
as the great darkness closed down. 



IV 

B ron, this is Doc. Listen to me 
carefully. You're on the De- 
stroyer ship. They brought you 
aboard while you were still uncon- 
scious. I gather they've brought 
your temperature down and a De- 



stroyer medic has given you a 
good examination. Trouble is he's 
come up with the wrong answer. 
He's decided to give you an injec- 
tion of an antihistamine — in fact, 
he's preparing it now. Whatever 
happens, you mustn't have that in- 
jection. 

“You got something useful out 
of Ander?” 

Yes. The shirt is woven of crel, 
an indigenous Onaria fungus 
spore notorious for its parasitic 
attachment to human flesh. The 
body's only defence is histamine. 
If that damn fool reduces your 
body histamine before those spor 
filaments have quit, they're liable 
to germinate into mature crel 
nodules underneath your skin. 
These are about the size of a Ter- 
ran cherry and about two hundred 
thousand of them developing in 
your flesh would literally tear you 
apart. 

“What do you advise?” 

Find a way to avoid anything 
being done until the shirt has quit 
of its own accord. It's your only 
chance. Is the shirt still firm? 

With an effort Bron propped 
himself up on one arm and ex- 
plored. “It’s coming away around 
the edges. Doc.” 

Good sign. It should peel fairly 
rapidly once it starts to go. An- 
other fifteen minutes could see 
you clean. Can you hold the medic 
off that long? 

“I can try.” 

Bron scanned the room quickly. 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



29 




Its sole door was fitted with a 
standard proximity lock keyed to 
operate only to the finger re- 
sponses of those entitled to enter. 
Laboriously he climbed from bed, 
found his limbs unwilling to 
accommodate his action and 
collapsed in a heap on the floor. 
He dragged himself to an instru- 
ment stanchion and looked for 
tools with which to attack the 
lock. The only thing relevant was 
a surgical laser. Unsteadily he 
took it to the door. 

The lock pattern was unfamil- 
iar to him and he had no way of 
locating the critical sensory ele- 
ments. A very real chance existed 
that interference would immobi- 
lize it in the open rather than the 
closed position. Finally he settled 
for merely shorting out the input 
leads. With a bit of luck the lock’s 
malfunctioning would appear to 
have been an inherent fault and 
not the result of tampering. He 
carefully fired the laser into the 
input channel. The laser hole was 
almost invisible but the result was 
an untidy short-circuit that seared 
the finish on the door around the 
lock. Fortunately the damage 
looked sufficiently amateurish to 
let him remain in character. 

Doc, who had been following the 
exercise through Bron’s eyes, was 
critical. 

How long will that hold them? 

“Depends on how anxious they 
are to get in. Dismantling the lock 
would take about twenty minutes. 



but the door could be cut away in 
seconds if necessary.” 

Bron lurched painfully back to 
bed and began working his fin- 
gers cautiously between his arm 
and the shirt. He soon found that 
the shirt was losing its consistency 
and shredding away in the man- 
ner of cotton wool. The under- 
lying skin was red, swollen and 
moist with lymph, but otherwise 
undamaged. As he worked at it, 
the fibers began to come away 
more easily and almost half the 
garment had been removed be- 
fore he heard noises at the door. 

The first sounds were those of 
someone baffled by an inability to 
operate the lock. Soon came the 
sound of metal applied to the door 
as if to force it. Then silence for a 
period. Then action again and the 
lock was cut away with a heavy- 
duty laser beam. 



A S THE medic entered, Bron, 
propped on one arm, was en- 
gaged in removing the last frag- 
ments of the shirt from his breast. 
As far as he could judge, the fila- 
ments adhering to his back had 
largely rubbed away on the bed- 
ding. The medic examined the 
lock with some consternation, at 
the same time glancing across to 
Bron and the fragmented shirt. 
Since there was no obvious 
connection between these two 
things, he left the lock to a tech- 
nician and came across the room.

IF 




“You got it away, eh? How you 
manage tha’?” 

“It’s histamine sensitive.” The 
swelling in Bron’s throat had raised 
the pitch of his voice to a queru- 
lous piping tone. He lay back with 
a show of exhaustion he did not 
have to fake. 

“Why you do it, eh? Why you 
put tha’ damn thing on?” 

Bron searched the synthesis but 
found no answer, so he scowled and 
said, “The shirt is an accepted 
penance in the eyes of the church.” 
“Bloody funny church — damn 
masochis’s, all of them. Are there 
no psychiatris’s on Onaris?” 

“Certainly. I myself have a doc- 
torate in psychiatry,” said Bron 
Ander Haltern tiredly. “But what 
makes you think that ills of the 
spirit are curable by techniques 
designed to remedy mere malfunc- 
tions of the mind?” 

The medic refused to be drawn 
into what he regarded as an 
idiotic argument. “Turn over and 
let me see tha’ back.” 

Bron turned. The medic cleaned 
his back with spirit and wiped 
away the remaining fibers of the 
shirt, retaining some for closer 
examination. He found the cruci- 
fix around Bron’s neck, looked at it 
curiously, dropped it back. 

“I’m goin’ to give you injection. 
With luck your skin should clear in 
a few hours. You’ll find the side ef- 
fec’s of the drug will make you li’le 
silly.” 

“Accept or refuse. Doc?” 



Risk the injection now that, the 
fibers have quit— but if you get a 
swelling yell like a fiend until they 
cut it out. 

The medic turned to get his tray. 
As he did so Bron could see past 
him to the doorway. Standing 
just inside, a silent witness to the 
proceedings, was a tall, graying 
man of exceptional physique and 
bearing. He was clad immacu- 
lately in the uniform of a senior 
Destroyer officer, though his 
precise rank was not apparent. 
His attention was completely up- 
on Bron, with a depth of con- 
centration and comprehension 
that made Bron feel that the hyp- 
no-synthesis was a very shallow 
camouflage for concealing his 
true identity and purpose. 

“Who’s that?” asked Bron aloud 
as the medic returned. 

“Colonel Daiquis’.” Both the 
medic and Doc replied as nearly 
simultaneously as possible, but 
Doc Veeder’s identification car- 
ried undertones of awe. 

What a piece of luck, Bron. 
Martin Daiquist is Canas right- 
hand man. 

Bron withdrew his arm from the 
vicinity of the hypodermic gun. 
“I wish to see someone in author- 
ity. I was brought here without 
consent and I have no wish to 
remain. I demand to be returned 
to the Seminary.” 

The medic looked down pity- 
ingly. “Tomorrow someone will 
explain why tha’s impossible.” 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS

His fingers gripped Bron’s arm 
like a steel vise. “From now until 
then you do exactly as you’re 
tol’.’’ 

Past the medic’s shoulder Bron 
could see Colonel Daiquist exam- 
ining the door around the lock. 
Then he saw him straighten 
suddenly and look round as if 
searching for something. The 
hypodermic gun was back on 
Bron’s arm, the muzzle pressing 
hard as the molecularized drugs 
were introduced through his skin 
without puncture. Almost imme- 
diately Bron felt a heavy dream- 
like state come over him, bringing 
a touch of euphoria that left him 
quite without care or qualm as 
Daiquist picked up the surgical 
laser and took it to the door. 

P erhaps on the altar of some 
Satanic mass the screaming 
sacrifice, shackled to the stone, 
twists in torment. The descending 
dagger tears tendon and ligament 
but leaves alive the cowering con- 
sciousness . 

“Who’s that?’’ 

. WHY DO YOU KEEP ON 
PRAYING? DONT YOU 
KNO W THA T GOD IS DEA D? 

“Tell me who you are or I’ll go 
tb sleep on you.” 

Dont do that, Bron. Tm having 
a hard enough task getting 
through to you as it is. Tm 
Ananias. 

“Go away. 1 don’t know you.” 
Dont you remember me at all? 



Don*t you even recall that 
Ananias is a liar? 

“Ananias is merely a name. 1 
can’t remember a thing. You must 
be the joker of the pack.” 
Frequently, Bron. But right now 
Tm far from joking. What drugs 
did the medic give you? 

“Should have been antihista- 
mine and antiallergen.” 

But you didnt see the labels on 
the phials? 

“No. He preloaded the hypoder- 
mic. I want to go to sleep.” 

Not so fast. From your poor 
reaction to the semantic recall Fd 
say the medic included a measure 
of a hypnotic alkaloid, possibly a 
truth serum. 

“Damn you, let me sleep!” 

I will — soon. But while you re 
sleeping I think someone may at- 
tempt to question you. Daiquist* s 
not too happy about you for some 
reason. We cant rely on the syn- 
thesis holding out under inten- 
sive psychological probing. If the 
situation turns critical we intend 
to use one of our corrective cir- 
cuits to throw you into a state of 
catatonic withdrawal. They*ll soon 
get you out of it, but it should serve 
to confuse the situation. 

The effort of conversation had 
pulled Bron into a lighter level of 
sleep from which he now found 
himself unable to relax. He tried 
to open his eyes, but the effort 
nearly defeated him and he was 
unable to maintain them open. In 
any case, the room was completely

IF 




dark and there was nothing what- 
ever to see. His mind settled down 
to a level of activity characteristic 
of a dream state but which left him 
fully conscious. This limbo of 
thought between sleep and wak- 
ing was positive confirmation of 
the introduction of a hypnotic 
drug into his system. 

He likened his feelings to those 
of a man floating on an air raft 
borne over slow waters down a long 
tunnel of darkness. The almost 
complete absence of tactile sensa- 
tion, coupled with the free-flowing 
volume of his thoughts and 
heightened imagination, produced 
all the imagery necessary to give 
substance to the illusion. He even 
thought he could hear the echoed 
muttering of the tide, disturbed 
by his passage, lapping against 
tunnel walls . 

Shock! Even in his drugged 
condition his whole nervous sys- 
tem reacted fitfully. 

“Ananias, for God’s sake — ” 

What is it, Bron? 

“What’s that noise? Sounds like 
turkeys gobbling— or water rip- 
pling around a stone.” 

/ hear nothing but ship noises. 
Sure its not imagination? 

“Damn you, no. It must be com- 
ing over the bio-electronic transfer 
link.” 

Not possible. We re transmit- 
ting nothing but my voice. The 
computer s monitoring the out- 
put from the Antares transmitter 
to you and that doesn't show any 



variation except for the usual star 
static. 

“Well, I’m receiving something 
else and it’s unholy — like the sound 
of liquid geese. Is it possible for 
anything else to get impressed on 
your transmission — something 
you couldn’t detect?” 

Only if it came from a source be- 
low the Antares reception 
threshold. But there's nowhere it 
could come from. There's only the 
void on the other side of your 
present position. You're way out 
on the rim of the universe. 

“Can they increase the sensi- 
tivity of the Antares receivers?” 

Not without rebuilding half a 
planet. Can you still hear it? 

“It’s still there, but not so clear- 
ly. The ambient ship noise seems 
to be increasing.” 

Correct. Sounds as though 
they're preparing for lift-off. I 
doubt you'll get any visitors until 
the ship's in free space. If you want 
to sleep, this'll be a good time. 
“Ananias — ” 

Yes? 

“Did we ever meet, you and I?” 
We know each other rather well. 
One day you'll remember. 

“And Jaycee — I know her?” 

/ can't answer questions about 
Jaycee. That's classified. 

“I just wondered what I ever did 
to get paired up with a vindictive 
bitch like her.” 

B ron attempted to relax, to 
throw himself into less con- 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



33 




scious depths of slumber, but each 
time his mind washed up on the 
same dark, tunneled tide and 
stopped short at the same reactive 
fear. The sound of the rising pat- 
tern of activity in the ship gradual- 
ly overlaid the phantom goose- 
mutter from nowhere and drove it 
below the limits of discernibility. 
The rising crescendo of the pres- 
sor beam projectors began to 
vibrate the whole fabric of the ship 
and the beats of their misreso- 
nance sang like some awful elec- 
tronic choir. 

Then he felt the lift-off — only a 
few meters at first, while the pres- 
sors were trimmed to take the 
weight of the ship evenly and with- 
out straining the vast structure. 
The breathtaking thunder of the 
planetary drive boomed in above 
the pressors’ song and added a 
quarter gravity of horizontal com- 
ponent of movement to the pres- 
sor’s lift. Some loose instruments 
somewhere in the room clattered 
into a tray, otherwise inside the 
ship these maneuvers were 
deceptively smooth and gentle. 
Outside the ship it would be 
different. Bron winced at the 
thought of white-hot exhaust gas 
razing a kilometer-wide weal 
across the scarred face of Ashur 
and of pressors leaving a hun- 
dred-kilometer channel of pul- 
verized buildings and hopelessly 
compressed soil before the ship 
abandoned planetary support and 
began to claw its way through the 



troposphere by thrust reaction 
alone. 

As the successive phases of take- 
off approached, the pitch and 
timber of the engine voices 
altered, died, were replaced by 
other sounds. Soon even the 
scream of the atmosphere on the 
hull tailed away and the ship set- 
tled to the vibrant thunder of the 
main gravity drive, which would be 
its prime mover until it was clear 
of the planetary system of which 
Onaris was part. Not until then 
could the cumbersome physical 
drive systems be abandoned in 
favor of the delicate subspace 
mechanisms which could flip the 
ship to its destination at mega- 
light velocities without regard to 
mass or momentum. 

Slowly Bron’s ears became at- 
tuned to the dissonance of the en- 
gine, and he even dived into fitful 
sleep before becoming aware 
that the light in the room had been 
turned on and that two men had ar- 
rived at his side. 

“Ander Haltern.” This was a 
statement, not an address. 

“Ah, so that’s our master syn- 
cretist. He looks too young. You 
know, Martin, they say he’s one of 
the most brilliant men alive.” 

“He came in wearing a shirt of 
some parasitic fungus. If that’s 
brilliance, I prefer mediocrity.” 
The second voice held a crisp 
bitterness of tone. A hand reached 
down and pulled at the crucifix on 
the chain, then let it go again. 



34 



IF 




**Chacun a son gout — sorry, 
Martin, I forgot you hated the 
old world and its babels. But every 
man to his own choice. Not every- 
one has a hobby such as yours — or 
is in a position to indulge in it 
even if he so desired.” 

“You’ve never objected be- 
fore.” The phrase was swiftly de- 
fensive. 

“My dear Martin, I am not ob- 
jecting. I was merely making the 
point that his desire to suffer pain 
and your desire to inflict it are 
merely two aspects of the same 
sort of character distortion.” 

A long, irritated silence fell. 

Then: “Do you want to question 
him?” 

“I don’t particularly want a 
recital of hick-world lineage and 
aspirations tonight, Martin. We 
know he’s Haltern, or he wouldn’t 
have been where he was when we 
found him. Whether he’s a prime 
catalyst we shan’t know until we 
get to the rendezvous.” 

You listening, Bron? 

“Yes.” Subvocally. 

Can you open your eyes and look 
at them. We\e got the cameras on. 
A short blink mil do. 

Bron shifted his head as though 
in disturbed sleep, then fought his 
eyelids open for a few bleared in- 
stants while he focused on the faces 
of the two men beside him. 

Nicely done, Bron. We*ve got 
what we wanted. One's Martin 
Daiquist, whom you've already 
seen. The other — man, you cer- 



tainly pick your company well! 

“Spool it, Ananias! I’m not 
thinking well tonight.” 

Just as well, perhaps. You've just 
been face to face with Cana him- 
self 

V 

H e awoke to the sound of a 
watch bell and sat up, shak- 
ing the sleep from his head. As the 
medic had predicted, his skin had 
cleared, except for a slight scale 
which feathered away as he 
touched it. The ache in his limbs, 
too, was now scarcely percepti- 
ble. 

“Anyone .awake?” He ad- 
dressed his unseen mentors in a 
spirit of bravado. 

Awake? Jaycee was annoyed. 
How the hell can anyone be oth- 
erwise with you snorin' your head 
off over the transfer link? How do 
you feel? 

“Like it was Christmas in Eu- 
ropa.” 

Good. Your memory's return- 
in'. Though with your usual in- 
take of drink and drugs it beats me 
how you ever managed to recall 
anythin' of Christmas in Europa. 

“Tell me about Daiquist. I’m 
sure he suspected I fixed that 
door.” 

Martin Daiquist, ninth genera- 
tion, Cana's lieutenant — and prob- 
ably more ruthless than Cana him- 
self. Responsible for the punitive 
expeditions against the four worlds 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



35 




that held out against the forma- 
tion of the Destroyer federation. 
Watch out for him. He's a mean 
cuss and as perceptive as the devil. 
His hobby is takin' people apart 
painfully. 

“I’ll bear that in mind. What are 
he and Cana doing here?” 

We*re still not sure. Neither 
would normally concern him- 
self with a mere planetary raid. 
Either there* s somethin big on- 
line or else they* ve sensed the Com- 
mando interest in the raid and 
come to investigate personal- 
ly. If the latter is the case, dont 
try any of your usual fool — 

She broke off to give Bron a 
chance to concentrate as the med- 
ic entered. He gave Bron a swift 
but thorough examination. 

“You bloody clear,” he said. 
“You don’ deserve it, treatin’ 
your skin like tha’. I’ll get you 
breakfas’ sent, an’ then you clear 
out, eh? An’ if you come back here 
again, nex’ time I’ll use the knife 
on you — without anaesthetics. 
See how much masochis’ you are. 
Colonel Daiquis’ wants to see 
you — an’ I don’ advise you play 
the fool with him. I can’ patch up a 
body after he’s done.” 

Soon an orderly fetched a hot 
breakfast on a tray and the smell 
of baked meats and coffee made 
Bron wonder when he had last eat- 
en. He could not remember. His 
own activities prior to the raid 
were still lost to him. The orderly 
also delivered a packet of cloth- 



ing. Bron found inside a light- 
weight, tunic-style uniform, un- 
derclothes and a white gown that 
was presumably used for bathing 
and relaxation. Compressing 
his lips in wry amusement, he se- 
lected only the underclothes and 
the gown. Fortunately the gown 
had a pocket large enough to ac- 
commodate the Bible. The re- 
maining garments he dropped in- 
to the surgical disposal chute, 
an action he felt certain was in 
keeping with his position as a 
Hal tern. 

When the medic came to escort 
him to Daiquist he raised his eye- 
brows at Bron’s choice of appar- 
el. “You’re bloody mad you don’ 
do as you’re tol’.” But his accept- 
ance of Bron’s assumed eccentric- 
ity was an encouraging sign that 
the incredible masquerade was 
viable and working. 



D aiquist looked up from his 
desk as Bron entered. 

“Ah, the syncretist. You seem to 
have recovered.” 

“Why am I here?” asked Bron 
sharply. “I demand to be re- 
turned to the Seminary.” 

Daiquist cocked his head on one 
side. “There’s no chance of 
that — no chance at all. Even if we 
wished, it wouldn’t be possible. 
And we don’t wish. We came a 
long way to get you, Haltern.” 
“The familiar is Bron,” said 
Bron archly. 



36 



IF 




“Very well — Bron. But don’t 
mistake your position. You are a 
prisoner just as surely as if you 
were chained to a wall. We 
hope — ultimately — to gain your 
cooperation. Until we do — and 
have satisfied ourselves of your 
integrity — you must consider 
yourself under close guard. I had 
myself preferred you to be con- 
veyed in the fleshholds, but 1 was 
overruled. However, you will end 
up there if you engage in any mis- 
chief.” 

Shortly the door opened and 
Cana himself came into the 
room. He looked searchingly at 
Bron, then took Daiquist’s place 
behind the desk. The impression 
he gave was that of a powerful in- 
tellectual rather than a ruthless 
creator and destroyer of em- 
pires. 

“Leave us, will you, Martin.” 

For a moment Daiquist ap- 
peared about to protest, then he 
turned and left the room, with a 
meaningful glance at the prison- 
er. Bron sensed that a dissension 
had already arisen over his status 
on the ship. Daiquist was pro- 
foundly displeased. 

Alone with the great space ty- 
rant, Bron sensed the magnitude 
of the man — Cana seemed to fill 
the room with a hypnotic pres- 
ence. 

“I don’t normally intervene 
in Martin’s affairs,” said Cana. 
“But I can’t afford to have a syn- 
cretist of your standing exposed 



to Martin’s personal curiosity. By 
all accounts you’re a man of many 
talents. You could be very useful 
to us. But Martin’s a suspicious 
devil — a quality that often makes 
him invaluable. He has a theory 
about you, Syncretist. He suspects 
you are not who you claim to be.” 

“I’m Bron Ander Haltern, 
master syncretist, late of Adano 
University on Onaris.’^ 

“If that’s so, then you won’t 
mind answering a few questions. 
If you get a word wrong I’ll leave 
you to Martin.” 

“I object to my word’s being 
doubted. I’ll answer anything you 
care to ask.” The synthesis was re- 
sponding weakly but he picked up 
the feeling and amplified it him- 
self, exaggerating the note of 
aggrievement. 

Bron, this could be sticky. Vm 
getting Ander on the line to back 
you up. 

“Check, Jaycee. I’m not getting 
much from the synthesis.” 

Cana went to a cabinet and 
drew out a sheaf of papers. “You 
see, Bron Haltern, we already 
know quite a lot about you. Where 
is Jeddah?” 

Trick question. Jeddah* s a town 
on Onaris — but the one a Haltern 
would remember first is Jeddah 
Haltern. He*s dead. The voice in 
Bron’s head was unfamiliar, but 
had a strong Onaris accent. 

“Jeddah’s dead,” said Bron. The 
synthesis stirred weakly. “He 
was fifth generation. Had he 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



37 




lived he’d have been a hundred 
and seven by now.” 

Good, but don t take chances. 

Cana nodded and leafed through 
the sheets until he came to some 
plainly tabulated lists. 

“Give me the title of the paper 
you presented to the Ninth Sym- 
posium of Galactic Science at 
Maroc on Priam.” 

The ninth symposium w^as on 
Mela five, not Priam. Priam was 
the tenth. 

“Which do you want,” asked 
Bron, “the paper from the tenth 
conference or the one given on 
Mela five?” 

“Mela five, of course,” said 
Cana, without looking back at 
the sheets. “I must have mistaken 
the line.” 

The Application of the Advan- 
cing-parameter Exclusion Theory 
to the Prognostic Delineation of 
the Patterns of Chaos. 

Bron repeated this verbatim. 
Cana nodded and threw the sheaf 
of papers back on the table. 

“You know, Syncretist, I don’t 
entirely disagree with Martin. 
He has an instinct for these things 
and he’s seldom wrong. He daren’t 
be wrong. Our survival is often 
entirely in his hands. So I reserve 
an open mind. But if you aren’t 
Haltern, then whoever did send 
you schooled you well — so well, 
perhaps, that whether you are the 
original or an impostor could be 
largely irrelevant.” 

“Now answer me a question,” 



said Bron, watching the man 
closely. “Why have the Destroy- 
er nations such urgent need for a 
master syncretist?” 

“Not just a master syncretist. 
They come in all calibers, and we 
already have most of them. What 
we most needed was a man who 
could combine syncretics with an 
appreciation of the patterns of 
chaos.” 

“Why?” 

“In a few hours,” said Cana, 
^‘we are making a space rendez- 
vous. When we are clear from there 
I may answer your question — or I 
may not. You may even answer it 
for yourself. Until then you have 
the freedom of the ship. The arm- 
orer will take your fingering for 
the proxlocks. You may enter any 
doors that open to you. The others 
are permanently barred to you. 
I’ll have the quartermaster find 
you cabinspace.” 

C ANA stood up, waved at the 
door. Bron needed no second 
indication of dismissal. He made 
his way straight to the den of the 
armorer. The latter took his fin- 
gering for the proxlocks and en- 
tered the resulting profiles in the 
access computer. 

Bron made an experimental tour 
of most of the open levels of the 
ship to verify his freedom of the 
locks. Incredibly, almost all the 
doors he tried responded to his 
touch. Back in the small cabin 
which had been allocated to him. 



38 



IF 




he lay back on the bunk and called 
up his unseen confederates. 

“Jaycee?” 

No. This is Ananias. Honey- 
bitch is feeding — I suspect on her 
usual diet of ground-glass and 
snake venom. What do you make 
of Canas giving you the freedom 
of the ship? 

“I’m not quite sure. The main 
question is why. I suspect I’m be- 
ing allowed just about enough 
rope to hang from, unless I’ve got 
it calculated wrong. The only 
sectors I haven’t been able to en- 
ter are Weaponry, Communi- 
cations and part of the comput- 
ing complex. It’s too damn easy. 
I’m willing to bet they log every 
meter I move.” 

How about the control room? 
We need to know the ships destin- 
ation as soon as possible. 

“I’ve not yet tried Control, I 
don’t dare seem too interested in 
the machinery here. Anyway, 
there’s some sort of space rendez- 
vous coming up shortly and the 
chances are that our heading will 
be different from there out. Once 
they start setting for a subspace 
hop I can pick up the coordin- 
ates straight from the subspace 
matrices if necessary — without 
even entering control.” 

Good idea. Mind you, they 
shouldnt be too worried. If they 
keep you out of Communica- 
tions they can be reasonably con- 
fident that whatever you learn 
cant be relayed to where it might 



be dangerous. I think our con- 
cept of the bio-electronic trans- 
fer link is sufficiently unique for it 
to remain completely unsus- 
pected. 

“I wish I were sure it is unique. 
I’m still worried about that goose- 
gobble I heard. Something else is 
operating on our transmission 
band. It certainly wasn’t star sta- 
tic or a normal sort of interfer- 
ence.” 

From calculation it seems that 
there's nothing near you in space 
that could conceivably be the sig- 
nal source. The present hypothe- 
sis is that it's a heterodyne signal 
from something on the ship itself. 

“It was no heterodyne. I’d say it 
had all the elements of an intelli- 
gent semantic content based on 
an advanced-level communica- 
tions system.” 

I'll follow it up, but I think 
you're certainly wrong. Hullo! 
What are they doing with your en- 
gines? 

Bron listened critically. “Apply- 
ing retro, I think. Could mean 
we’re approaching rendezvous.” 

Rendezvous with what? 

“It hasn’t been said or implied, 
but I’d guess with the remainder 
of the Destroyer fleet, including 
those that held orbit round Ona- 
ris during the raid.” 

/ wonder why. They wouldn't 
dare to attempt to hold forma- 
tion in subspace, so why assem- 
ble beforehand? 

“Sounds as though they’re put- 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS

ting call signs on the boards right 
now. The center of attention 
seems to be the chartroom.” 

Better not look too nosy. Wait 
till the rendezvous has been es- 
tablished, then go up. 

“Are you giving me orders, 
Ananias?” 

Yes. Have you forgotten how 
to take them? 

“Let’s get this straight,” said 
Bron. “I’m on the operating end 
of the transfer link. Mine’s' the 
hide that pays for any mistakes 
and mine’s the body they consign 
to space when the charade goes 
sour. Ask for any information 
you need, but how and when 1 ob- 
tain it is my option. If you want a 
puppet, jet off and buy yourself a 
doll.” 

Say that softly, little soldier. 
Ananias’s voice was dangerous. 
You've more than one electrode in 
your brain and the controls are un- 
der my fingers on this console. 
Shall I read the decals? Cataton- 
ic Withdrawal. Anaesthesia 
With Maintained Conscious- 
ness. Punishment. Death. They 
aren't written that way, of 
course — we're great believers in 
the use of symbols to gloss over 
the earthier and more painful 
facts of your existence — but the 
effects are just those. You see, we 
can insist on discipline. 

“You’ve forgotten a button, 
Ananias.” 

/ think not. 

“While you’re playing at being 



God, shouldn’t you also have one 
with the symbol for resurrec- 
tion?” 



T he sudden cutoff of the grav- 
ity drive threw a vast silence 
over Bron’s immediate envi- 
rons, a stillness punctuated only 
by muted ship noises. The call 
boards were still chiming the re- 
assembly call. Bron left his cabin 
and went to investigate. For sev- 
eral minutes the gangways were 
full of crewmen hastening to re- 
group. Moving aside to allow one 
to pass, Bron was instead saluted 
smartly. 

“Mastership Haltern, Cana 
wishes you to join Colonel Dai- 
quist and himself in the chart- 
room.” 

Bron nodded, trying to analyze 
the attitude of the crewman. His 
instructions appeared to include 
the implication to treat Bron 
with the respect due a Destroyer 
officer. This could only be a re- 
flection of Haltern’s value as a 
master syncretist to the De- 
stroyer nations. A suspicion 
slowly formed. 

“Ananias, answer me some- 
thing. What factors made you so 
sure Ander Haltern was the only 
man on Onaris the Destroyers 
would select?” 

A knowledge of the Onaris in- 
tellectual scene coupled with 
some good guesswork. Why? 
“Because the fact that it worked 



40 



IF 




is too damn much of a coinci- 
dence. They must have had a very 
distinct reason for picking up 
Haltern alone and you must have 
known exactly what that reason 
was. Now give me the facts.” 

I already have given them to 
you. 

“Liar.” 

Ananias laughed softly. So you 
do remember just a little about 
A nanias? 

“Only that you aren’t to be 
trusted.” 

Of course not. But there s abso- 
lutely nothing you can do about 
it. 

“Think again, Ananias,” said 
Bron. “As agent on this team I’ve a 
right to any information I con- 
sider relevant. Tell Doc I want a 
straight answer to the question I 
asked you — the data so far avail- 
able looks very suspect.” 

In the chartroom he found the 
atmosphere electric with ten- 
sion. All the navigation staff, in- 
cluding those off duty, were gath- 
ered to watch the screens. In the 
deep-space sector station both 
Daiquist and Cana were present, 
watching points of light against 
the cosmic black. 

Daiquist looked up, saw Bron 
and scowled, then beckoned him 
to join them. By the time Bron had 
reached the deep-sector station 
all eyes were again intent on the 
screens and no explanations were 
offered. Daiquist was supervis- 
ing some chronometric plot- 



ting — whatever event was about 
to take place obviously had time 
as an important component of 
the equation. Bron settled for a 
position with a good view of a 
subsidiary monitoring screen, 
a situation which also afforded 
him an opportunity to watch th^ 
activities in the whole station. 
The screen itself gave him an im- 
pressive view of the bright ring of 
ships . of the Destroyer fleet now 
locked in tight formation and mo- 
tionless, waiting for something 
to happen. 

As the minutes passed, so the 
tension grew. Then, as if follow- 
ing some indefinable clue, the 
deep-space controller signaled. 

“I think this is it.” 

He rapidly centered some al- 
most invisible object under the 
graticules of his screen and began 
calling coordinates. All the oth- 
er scanners turned outward to 
face the depths of space, though 
few others had the range to detect 
an object at such a distance. Dai- 
quist and Cana pressed forward to 
look over the controller’s shoul- 
der. The displayed image as yet 
had no form, being a mere scatter 
of electronic noise. 

Within seconds the computers 
had acquired sufficient data to 
begin processing and the screen 
picture steadied to a rocklike con- 
centricity in the graticules as 
electronic fingers searched and 
corrected for the minute signal 
reflection from some remote 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS

splint of matter far in the empti- 
ness of space. 

“That’s it.” 

Cana had acquired a printout 
from a computer peripheral and 
a second printout terminal was 
already making a comparison 
with something set deep in the 
computer’s micromemory cells. 

Daiquist returned to the chron- 
ometric plotting and watched the 
pantograph arms begin to sweep 
wide curves across the plotting 
boards. His lips grew taut. 

“Only sixteen point one hours 
late this time. The positional ac- 
curacy is exact and the chrono- 
logical accuracy is still improv- 
ing.” 

“Damn,” said Cana. “Still I 
suppose we must be thankful for 
those two certainties among all 
the patterns of chaos. I’m getting 
a bit old for entropy,” He glanced 
up and saw Bron’s quizzical inter- 
est. For a second his eyes looked 
into Bron’s with a depth of com- 
prehension that rocked Bron back 
on his heels. 

“I have a curious feeling about 
you, Syncretist. There’s some- 
thing in your face that suggests 
you know what chaos is. I just 
wonder if your being here is a fact 
any less calculated than the tim- 
ing and trajectory of those, ” 

H e nodded back to the 
screens. Bron’s eyes followed, 
fascinated, as the range closed and 
the scanners steadily improved 



in resolution. His first impres- 
sion was that of a rectangular 
plate or a door tumbling slowly 
and aimlessly through the depths 
of space. The speed with which the 
details improved was a measure 
of the very considerable veloci- 
ty with which the object was mov- 
ing, yet viewed through the screens 
against the backdrop of the far- 
ther galaxies, its progress ap- 
peared leisurely indeed. 

As it neared it became more dis- 
tinct in form. Seven long, thick, 
black cylinders, reminiscent of 
those used for compressed gas, 
had been strapped to a thick, black 
yoke. That appeared to be all; no 
instruments, no antenna, no so- 
lar panels were visible — none of 
the delicate and complex sensory 
and corrective mechanisms usu- 
ally associated with unmanned 
space-traversing objects. If any- 
thing, the overall impression was 
one of extreme age and durabil- 
ity rather than of technological 
prowess. There was something in- 
credibly sinister about these black 
canisters tumbling idly through 
space. 

The scanners were now produc- 
ing almost a close-up view of the 
object and the hideous weld 
seams, massive and unfettled, 
stood out plainly. Had somebody 
broken off a part of some ancient 
gas-cooking plant and hurled it 
carelessly into space, the effect 
would have been similar. But there 
was nothing careless about its tra-

jectory, to judge from the meticu- 
lous care with which its path was 
being recorded by the Destroyer 
technicians. Some great and des- 
perate event seemed about to hap- 
pen, but everyone about Bron was 
too intent on some given task to 
offer explanations. 

He gasped as the reeling mass 
filled the screens, as though falling 
straight upon Cana’s ship. But this 
was a trick of screen magnifica- 
tion. Suddenly the scanners 
reeled and Bron found himself 
watching the object falling away 
in a higgledy-piggledy tumble as 
it passed through the ring of watch- 
ing ships. 

Daiquist was again busy watch- 
ing the chronometric plotting, 
as successive sweeps of the pan- 
tograph thickened the once faint 
traces to multiple bands of lines 
like the diagram of a muscular 
skeleton. Cana watched the cylin- 
ders draw away, his face a cloud of 
darkness. Then with sudden de- 
cision he turned his back on the 
screens and walked away. 

His path took him past Bron and 
his eyes widened sagely. 

“Watch that one through, Syn- 
cretist. I shall want to talk to you 
after.” 

W ONDERING, Bron stepped 
forward into Cana’s vacated 
seat with the main screen in full 
view before him. Remorselessly 
the crossed hairs of the screen 
graticule locked on to the path of 



the retreating canister^, which 
appeared to diminish slowly in 
size and then advance again as the 
magnification was periodical- 
ly adjusted to offset the increas- 
ing range. Bron followed their 
dark passage with deep interest. 
The nemesis appeared to have 
passed, but the tension in the 
chartroom was undiminished. 
So intent was he on following the 
progress of the cylinders framed 
at the center of the screen that he 
neglected the implication of the 
changing hues of the background. 

Onaris! Ananias’s voice broke in 
on his thoughts. Give us a broader 
view, Bron. 

Bron scanned the whole screen 
area, realizing with a start that 
the variegated background hues 
were, in reality, the non-focused 
outlines of seas and continents. 
Inexorably the black cylinders 
continued under the crossed 
hairs of the graticule, while the 
physical details of the planetary 
surface began to grow in resolu- 
tion. 

The moment of impact was un- 
forgettable. 

The blossoming fireball must 
have extended into space a full 
planetary diameter, a gulf of fan- 
tastic fiery plasma that streaked 
up and out with a velocity be- 
yond the regions of belief. From 
his knowledge of physics Bron 
knew that such a fantastic holo- 
caust must have stripped the at- 
mosphere from the planet in sec-

onds. The next stage was a sort of 
coalescenced, the fireball contract- 
ing and drawing in upon itself as 
if to concentrate its essence. The 
color shifted from red to brilliant 
yellow, surrealistic with an 
ethereal fringe of mercurial blue. 
Around it the planetary features 
reappeared, but not with the cool 
greens and buffs of before. Now 
whole continents stood out as if 
raised to cherry heat, and where 
the seas had been were bowls of 
black, crawling with fire like soot 
on a chimney. 

Then the planet broke up, not 
quickly, but with the wrong-seem- 
ing slowness of massive events 
seen from a distance; a kind of re- 
luctant finality. Centered upon 
the spot where the fireball had 
condensed, the planet began to 
spew up its liquid core in a gout of 
molten heavy metals, which 
coalesced in space and drew back 
toward the gravitic center of the 
mass, obliterating continents 
and coastlines with a horrific 
tide of matter returned to the 
state from which the planet had 
once cooled. As this happened, the 
shell of the planet broke, contin- 
ents rearing crazily on end like 
ships sinking on a sea and land 
masses floating in broken frag- 
ments like dross on molten tin. 

Bron kept no record of the hours 
that passed while this incredible 
scene was enacted. The death of 
individuals was something he 
had been trained to accept uncon- 



ditionally; the death of nations 
was one of the aims of war. Even 
whole species died occasionally 
in the name of some cause — but the 
death of an entire planet was 
something that rendered Man 
and his entire status in the uni- 
verse of no greater account than a 
biological culture grown in a 
dish and discarded when the ex- 
periment was finished. This was 
an object lesson in finite reality. 



VI 

(( ALL right, Ananias, so I’ve 
seen it. Now explain it to 
me.” Bron’s voice was hardened by 
his viewing of the incident. 

How do you think they got the 
name Destroyers, Bron? 

“But where did the hellburner 
come from? It didn’t originate 
from this fleet.” 

It wouldnt. A ship carrying 
weapons like that would scarcely 
be invited to make planetfall on a 
flesh raid. Even in standoff orbit it 
could be a liability. They must 
keep it clear out in the void. When 
the raid is finished it slides in a 
massive hellburner io take care 
of the evidence. 

“I shouldn’t have thought that 
Cana needed to destroy the evi- 
dence. He’s strong enough not to 
care what the Galaxy thinks.” 

In five years galactic patrols 
have found around thirty-seven for- 
merly inhabited planets turned in-

to nickel-iron slag balls. Eleven of 
these, equipped with subspace 
transmitters, had broadcast warn- 
ings of Destroyer attack shortly 
before their obliteration. Five oth- 
ers put out standard light-velocity- 
limited transmissions with the 
same theme. Some of these plan- 
ets were dead three years before 
anyone got the message. 

Bron considered this in silence 
for a moment. 

“Tell me, Ananias, what was the 
population of Onaris?” 

About two hundred million. 

“Then if we knew the Destroy- 
ers were coming when they did, 
why the hell didn’t we have a fleet 
waiting for them instead of only 
me?” 

If we d known that Daiquist and 
Cana were with the party, we prob- 
ably would have had our fleet 
there. As it was we were merely im- 
plementing a policy decision to 
locate their base world. 

“Policy decision? That decision 
just cost two hundred million 
Onarians their lives. What kind of 
policy is that?” 

Bron froze as a hand clamped on 
his shoulder. Daiquist dropped in- 
to the seat next to him. 

“Why so thoughtful, Syncretist? 
Have you never seen a world de- 
stroyed before?” 

“That was Onaris,” said Bron 
flatly. “All gone. In the name of 
God, why did you have to do it? 
You’d had presumably already 
taken all that you came for.” 



Daiquist’s eyes were searching 
Bron’s face critically. “I rather 
wonder if we didn’t get a little 
more than we came for. You make 
me uneasy, Syncretist. I never 
did have much time for intellec- 
tuals — and an intellectual with 
the build and tone of a fighting 
man definitely needs watching. 
For myself I wouldn’t take the 
risk. I’d prefer to kill you-now, but 
Cana has decided otherwise. I ad- 
vise you to prove him right.” 

Bron returned the scrutiny in 
depth. “You still haven’t answered 
my question. Why was it neces- 
sary to destroy Onaris?” 

“Syncretist you may be,” said 
Daiquist, “but you’ve still got a 
hell of a lot to learn. Come, Cana 
wants to see you in his suite. We’re 
going to give you the chance to do 
a little exercise in cooper- 
ation.” 

“Cooperation? My God — you 
expect me to cooperate with you 
after that?** He made a dramatic 
gesture toward the spotted frre- 
cherry that was all that was left of 
Onaris on the screen. “I would 
rather die.” 

“I’d rather you died,” said Dai- 
quist. “Unfortunately the decision 
isn’t mine. But listen carefully to 
what Cana has to say, because it’s 
likely you’ll change your mind.” 

“You don’t bend a Haltern that 
easily. Damn you, Daiquist! If I 
must take this journey, let it be in 
the flesh holds.” The synthesis still 
stirred weakly. 



PATTE RNS OF CHAOS 



45 




Steady, Bron. Ananias’s voice 
was cautioning. 

“I don’t happen to be offering 
you the choice.” Daiquist drew his 
sidearm menacingly. “It’s not a 
good idea to keep Cana waiting. If 
you’re thinking of resistance — re- 
member that I never shoot to 
kill.” 

H aving no option, Bron rose 
and reluctantly walked in the 
indicated direction. Daiquist fol- 
lowed, his weapon aimed low. At 
the door of Cana’s suite Bron was 
surprised to find the lock respond 
easily to his own hand. Cana was 
sitting at a large desk, watching 
strip issuing from a computer 
printout terminal. This had evi- 
dently been his occupation for 
some time, for the floor was lit- 
tered with discarded strip lengths 
printed with compact series of fig- 
ures. 

“Ah, Syncretist.” Cana kicked 
the sprawling strips into an un- 
tidy pile. “Stay with us, will you, 
Martin.” 

“It might be wisest.” Daiquist 
selected a chair and gestured 
Bron to another. Cana addressed 
himself to Bron. 

“I take it from your face that 
you’ve seen what happened to 
Onaris.” 

“I’ve seen what happened. What 
I can’t establish is why it was nec- 
essary. Surely you’d already tak- 
en what you wanted?” 

Cana frowned, a display indi- 



cating a depth of concentration 
outside Bron’s experience. 

“You won’t understand this yet, 
but it was precisely because we’d 
taken what we wanted that Onaris 
died. Almost our only means of 
establishing the success of a raid 
is whether a hellburner blasts the 
life out of the target planet within 
hours of our liftoff.” 

Bron was silent for a long sec- 
ond, wrestling with the wrongness 
of this statement. Finally he 
looked back at Cana and shook his 
head. 

“That doesn’t make sense.” 

“It does to us. The point I wish 
to make clear to you is that we 
didn’t put that hellburner down 
there. Somebody else did.” 

He's lying, Bron, Ananias’s 
voice was positive. 

“You don’t expect me to believe 
that?” 

“In the circumstances, no. I 
know your intellectual record 
and I realize it precludes you 
from accepting a statement un- 
less you are satisfied with the evi- 
dence on which it’s based. I’m 
therefore giving you the oppor- 
tunity of establishing and 
examining your own evi- 
dence — and drawing your own 
conclusions.” 

“How?” 

“I invite — no, dare you — to ex- 
amine any available record from 
any ship of this fleet and attempt 
to calculate the source and time 
of origin of the missile that de-

IF 




stroyed Onaris. Two points I would 
add. One — although the missile's 
position was exact, its arrival 
was sixteen point one hours late in 
time. Two — ” Cana swung full- 
face to Bron for emphasis and 
Daiquist raised his sidearm mean- 
ingly — “you may have access to 
our video records of the screens 
and any other data in our posses- 
sion to enable you to calculate the 
missile’s exact point of impact on 
Onaris. Although its effect would 
have been the same wherever it had 
struck, I think you’ll find its point 
of impact coincides exactly with 
your own position sixteen point 
one hours earlier. You see, Bron 
Haltern, that missile wasn’t spe- 
cifically intended for Onaris — or 
even for us. That missile was in- 
tended for you — personally.” 



W HA T you makin of it, Bron? 

“Not sure, Jaycee. Could be 
an elaborate sort of game — a 
trick to secure the cooperation 
of whatever intelligentsia they 
have lifted in a raid. Or it could 
be that Cana’s quite genuine 
when he says that the Destroyer’s 
aren’t to blame.” 

Ananias doesnt think so. He 
was as mad as a scalded tiger when 
you accepted Canas invitation to 
check out the data on the hellburn- 
er. 

“I’m not sure that I trust Ana- 
nias any more than I trust Cana. 
Do you record everything that 



transpires over the transfer link?” 
It*s all sound- and video-taped 
for future reference. Why? 

“Tell Doc I’d like to check back 
through the sessions I’ve had with 
Ananias. I’m not convinced I’m 
getting the right answers.” 

Uh! Even in amnesia the mis- 
trust isnt dead. If you re taking 
on Ananias youd best be reminded 
he*s a pretty dangerous cuss. 

“So am I, Jaycee. And the way 
I see this mission, it’s strictly one- 
way, so I don’t have anything to 
lose. Will you do it?” 

With pleasure. Ed love to get 
hold of something that would 
make the Godlost weaklin sweat. 

“Then stay on the line — because 
there are things about General 
Ananias that I’m beginning to re- 
member.” 

Bron had acquired a master-pro- 
gram panel in part of the comput- 
ing complex to which he had ac- 
cess. Two Destroyer programers 
had been assigned to him and a du- 
ty technician was on sound and vi- 
sion call. All were quickly supply- 
ing whatever services or data Bron 
chose to ask for. Bron, relying 
less on the failing Haltern synthe- 
sis than on his own training, was 
speedily assessing his requirements 
and impressing the information on 
a standard location-of-source 
space-weapons program. The in- 
formation available from the ring 
of Cana’s fleetships through which 
the object had passed added a di- 
mensional certainty to his calcula- 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS

tion that was normally lacking in 
similar studies. 

Cana can't hope to get away 
with this, Bron. Any computer- 
man worth his salt and given ac- 
cess to the data you re gettin must 
be able to give the lie to the claim. 

“Unless the computer is bent. 
There’s a lot of this computing 
complex I can’t get near. They 
could be using it to apply correc- 
tives so that I can only get the an- 
swers they want me to have.” 

That*s why we re read in every- 
thin through you, Bron. We* re go- 
ing to run the same computation 
here so we can compare differ- 
ences. 

“Fine. I’m just about through 
on the location-of-source program. 
I’ll set it running.” 

We*re going to rewrite the pro- 
gram to suit our equipment. We*ve 
got all the data we need, so we 
wont be far behind you. 

Bron called the Destroyer tech- 
nician. “How’s that video record 
coming on?” 

“She nearly ready, if you like 
to come up to projection room.” 

Bron cast a hurried glance over 
his own series of figures, then 
passed it to the programers. In the 
projection room the technician was 
waiting. 

“Ah’ve put the las’ two hundred 
frames before explosion on closed 
loop. Give you las’ four seconds 
of approach withou’ spoilin’ defi- 
nition.” 

“Run it.” 



Bron dropped into a seat before 
the screens. 

The Destroyer technician looked 
at him briefly; his smile acknow- 
ledged the professional compe- 
tence in Bron’s way of organizing 
his inquiries. “Ah’ll put her on big 
screen, Mr. ’altern.” 

“The form of address is Mas- 
tership,” said Bron severly. “Have 
you got that reconnaissance pho- 
tograph of Ashur yet?” 

“Jus’ cornin’ on facsimile print- 
er. Soon as scan is complete we’ll 
print projection slide for mon- 
tage.” 

“I don’t want montage. I want 
to alternate the scanner image with 
the reconnaissance projection.” 

“Ah get poin’ now. You alter- 
nate two images a’ same magnifi- 
cation, you able pinpoin’ position 
of contac’ within few hundred me- 
ters.” 

“To be certain, I need to locate 
to within one meter.” 

The technician whistled. “Tha’s 
no’ possible. Mastership.” 

“Call me Bron.” 

The technician smiled broadly. 
“Ah’m Camaj. You no amateur, 
Bron. You know wha’ you’re 
doin’. Ah’ve tried some fixes in 
my time, but this the closes’ Ah 
ever tried.” 

“Can you do it?” 

“A fix to one meter from t’irty 
million kilometers? You need be 
jokin’ ” 

“I’m not joking, Camaj. I do 
need that accuracy to be sure.”

IF 




“Then we do i’ as you say. You 
show me how.” 

T he screen lit up with the video- 
recorded last four seconds be- 
fore the missile struck, repeated 
endlessly from the closed tape 
loop. In these last fragments of 
time for Onaris, the image of the 
city of Ashur flashed briefly into 
focus, a mere vague pattern of 
blocked browns and grays, unrec- 
ognizable as it stood, meaningful 
only if compared with a more de- 
tailed view. Central in the field of 
view was the black shape of the 
missile still aimlessly atwist in the 
instants before its terrible reaction. 

The scene was swiftly replaced 
with a projected reconnaissance 
holograph of Ashur taken from a 
ship orbiting around Onaris before 
the cataclysm. Here the ground 
details stood cut with perfect clar- 
ity, with buildings, vehicles, and 
even the minute dots of individuals 
easily identifiable. The magnifica- 
tion of the projection was adjusted 
to that of the taped record and 
then the two images were alter- 
nated to show coincidences of 
outline. Roughly half the recon- 
naissance record had been trav- 
ersed before the two patterns 
showed point for point similarity. 
Bron’s final micro-adjustments 
took fully half an hour. 

“Jaycee, what was my exact po- 
sition sixteen point one hours be- 
fore the explosion?” 

You were chained in the alcove 



at the west end of the church of the 
Sacred Relic, The Destroyer par- 
ty was just about to collect you, 

“You saw where the hellburner 
struck?” 

Yes, At the west end of the 
church slightly to the right of the 
centerline. In other words, it went 
as near as possible right down on 
to that alcove. 

“Correct. Which is too much of 
a coincidence to be true. I don’t 
like coincidences that can be mea- 
sured with a micrometer attach- 
ment.” 

He glanced up and saw the tech- 
nician watching him. “Convinced, 
Camaj?” 

“Ah’m convinced. Tha’ tech- 
nique Ah use again. Will tha’ be 
enough?” 

Bron nodded. “More than 
enough to be going on with. How 
the hell does anyone project a hell- 
burner from outspace with that 
sort of accuracy?” 

The technician shrugged his 
shoulders. “You’re th’ syncretis’. 
For me, wonder is how she gets 
through atmosphere withou’ burn- 
ou’. After all, she has no nose 
cone — ” 

“Jaycee, you heard that?” 

Yes, Bron. We'd picked up the 
same point. Not only remarkable 
weaponry, but a remarkable wea- 
pon too. It should have burned out 
in the atmosphere at that velocity, 
but there was no sign it even got 
hot. 

“All the more reason to find out 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS

where it came from.” Bron dis- 
missed the technician and went 
back to the computing section. 
The computer had already printed 
out the directional components 
and was engaged in comparing lists 
of known spatial objects which had 
occupied trajectory intercept posi- 
tions at previous points in time. 
A mere glance at the time scale in 
which it was now seeking a match 
stopped Bron’s heart a full beat. 

When the final printout came 
he folded the paper deftly with the 
characters inside and without look- 
ing at them. 

Let*s see the answers, Bron. 
Ananias’s voice cut sharply into 
his head. 

“No. Let me hear yours first.” 

Vm not asking. That's an or- 
der. 

“Get off my back, Ananias.” 

You b — Ananias’s voice was 
suddenly cut off Fragments of 
conversation followed too low in 
volume for Bron to catch. Finally 
Jaycee’s voice came through. 

Sorry about that, Bron. Ananias 
was throwing his weight about. I 
don't think he'll try it again — not 
in that way. As we see it, there has 
to be a ship out in the void. The lo- 
cation of source tensor carried 
back to known spatial objects on 
the trajectory doesn't make sense. 
The only intercept is a location in 
Messier 31. 

“The spiral nebula in Andro- 
meda?” 

No less. Travelin at its sublu- 



minal velocity from there would 
have taken all of seven hundred 
million years, so I think we can 
rule that one out. 

Bron unfolded the printout. “All 
of which figures agree with mine. 
The Destroyer computer isn’t 
bent.” 

So Cana does have a hellburner 
carrier way out in the void. 

“It looks as though somebody 
has. I wouldn’t be too certain it 
was Cana.” 

What you meanin, Bron? 

“My dear Jaycee, Cana sent his 
crew to the Seminary because Hal- 
tern was due to take up his resi- 
dency there. That was a reasonable 
action based on prior intelligence. 
But when that hellburner was 
launched not even Cana could have 
known exactly where in the Sem- 
inary Haltern would be at any spe- 
cific time. In fact, the only off- 
worlders who knew at all times my 
precise position were Doc Veeder, 
Ananias — and yourself” 

A nanias turned from the 

screen, critical disgust written 
broadly on his face. 

“So much for your ability to 
handle Bron, honey-bitch. Let hini 
break away like that again and 
I’ll have you reduced to walking 
the streets — and knowing your 
poisonous talents I doubt if you’d 
make much of a success of even 
that.” 

“Jet off, you Godlost runt.” 
Jaycee smoldered cobra-bright.

IF 




“What you doin’ — tryin’ to drum 
up some pimpin’ for the day you 
lose your pension?” 

Ananias glanced involuntarily 
at the tabs on his shoulders. His 
small, pink lips were even more 
moist than usual and his bright 
eyes seemed to be reflecting some 
traumatic inner fire. 

“Don’t underestimate me, hon- 
ey-bitch. I could do it, you know.” 
“Sick dreams, Ananias. You’ll 
be lucky to retain your commis- 
sion when Doc gets through with 
you.” 

The import of her phrase took 
a full second before it produced a 
shock reaction. 

“Say that again — slowly, honey- 
bitch.” His voice was sharp and 
suspicious. 

“Don’t play innocent. You know 
its against regulations to destroy 
recordin’s of transfer-link ses- 
sions.” 

“What?” In his anger Ananias 
raised his hand as though to strike 
her, but forbore with the agonized 
realization that before his blow 
could fall she would probably have 
broken his arm. He forced himself 
into a more calculating mood. 
“Who put you on to that?” 

“Bron — askin’ questions.” She 
was enjoying his discomfort. 

“And you told Doc?” 

“Of course. I even booked him 
a call to Commando Central so 
he didn’t get time to cool off.” 
“That was very stupid, honey- 
bitch.” Ananias was struggling 



with his anger. “Doc should never 
have made that call. I carry the 
General Staff mandate — and that 
means I effectively outrank every- 
one on this installation. If it suits 
me to destroy some or even all of 
the recordings, neither you nor 
Medic-commander Veeder has 
any business interfering.” 

“You’re damn wrong there.” 
Veeder, entering the door had 
caught the trailing end of the con- 
versation. Although his expression 
remained within its authorized 
lines of concern, the reddening of 
his face and neck showed the height 
of his inner feelings. “I’ll remind 
you. General Ananias, that this is 
a Commando installation and sub- 
ject only to Commando control.” 

“And I’ll remind you,” said 
Ananias, “that you are engaged on 
a joint mission with Intelligence 
under a GenStaff Order. That 
places you under my jurisdiction. 
So far, I can’t say I’m impressed 
with your handling of the situation. 
Honey-bitch has demonstrated la- 
mentably little control over her 
agent and as for Bron himself — 
look at the kind of mental cripple 
I’m expected to work through: con- 
cussion, amnesia, schizophrenia 
and persecution paranoia — to say 
nothing of refusal to accept orders, 
insubordination and outright rebel- 
lion.” 

“You’re a fine one to talk about 
mental cripples.” Jaycee was furi- 
ous. “Anyway, Ananias, where did 
you get the idea Bron suffers from 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



51 




persecution paranoia? I’ve seen 
nothing of it. It couldn’t just be on 
part of the record you found it con- 
venient to erase?” 

“Honey-bitch,” said Ananias 
dangerously, “I’ve already told you 
what I’m going to do for you. And 
as for Doc, I think premature re- 
tirement on a greatly reduced pen- 
sion would still be more than jus- 
tice. As of tomorrow, I’m bring- 
ing in Intelligence operatives to 
take over your function here.” 
“Drop dead, Ananias.” Veeder 
subconsciously adopted Jaycee’s 
infectious mood of contempt. “At 
my request. Commando Central 
has yerified that the operating arm 
of this mission remains under my 
control. Your capacity is purely 
advisory. As far as I’m concerned, 
you’re here on sufferance.” 

“I shall contest that decision 
with GenStaff. You can’t hope to 
win.” 

“Perhaps not, but while the or- 
der stands you will not destroy my 
records and you will not interfere 
with the operation of this installa- 
tion.” 

“And suppose I do?” 

V EEDER’S face broke into a 
taut glimmer of amusment, 
which was the nearest he allowed 
himself to approach to human tri- 
umph. 

“If you do. General Ananias, 
you’ll find yourself under close ar- 
rest in a Commando cell block 
awaiting trial by court martial.” 



“You couldn’t hold me.” 

“I could — for long enough to 
see this mission through without 
interference.” 

Jaycee said: "Touche!** in a 
manner calculated not to improve 
Ananias’s declining temper. 

White-faced, Ananias turned to 
face the pair of them. For a mo- 
ment it was uncertain whether he 
was nearer laughter or tears. 

“You won’t get away with this, 
you know. Within a week this unit 
will be entirely under my control.” 

“Don’t need a week, Ananias.” 
Jaycee was on the point immedi- 
ately. “Any time now Bron should 
have the coordinates we need. That 
was the mandate, wasn’t it — the 
establishment of the location of 
the Destroyer’s baseworld? It’s 
all over then except for the shoot- 
in’.” 

“Not quite over, honey-bitch. 
I’ll have a few old scores to settle 
first.” 

Doc moved back to the attack. 
“In the meantime, Ananias, there 
are questions that need answering.” 

“Such as?” 

“The goose-mutter which Bron 
heard — to which I would have at- 
tached no great significance had 
you not bothered to erase all ref- 
erence from the tapes.” 

“And?” 

“The question of how you could 
be so certain that Ander Haltern 
was the only Onaris technocrat 
who would interest the Destroy- 
ers?”

IF 




Ananias was fazed momentarily. 
“I thought that was all — ” 

“Destroyed? Not quite, Ana- 
nias. The transfer link to Antares 
is routed through Commando Sig- 
nals. They also make recordings 
of everything transmitted . or re- 
ceived.” 

“That will have to be stopped,” 

“You’ll need a damn good rea- 
son.” 

“I have one.” 

“Then let’s have it. The Com- 
mandos have spent nearly a quar- 
ter of their total budget for six 
years just setting up this project 
and my best agent’s out on that 
Destroyer ship right now. If there 
are any facts we haven’t been 
given, I suggest you give them fast. 
I’m damn sure Commando Cen- 
tral would never have agreed to 
cooperate this far if they had had 
a suspicion something was being 
held back.” 

“There are levels of Security,” 
said Ananias. “This one is out of 
the topmost drawer. The fewer 
people there are who know, the 
better.” 

“You’re lyin’, Ananias. Even 
Veeder was surprised by the vehe- 
mence of Jaycee’s attack. “I know 
when you’re lyin’ because it’s the 
only time you look human. God! 
Security’s just a word you use for 
gettin’ your own way without 
question — but don’t be so naive as 
to try it on me. You’re up to 
something and it stinks. 

“Honey-bitch,” said Ananias, 



“you’d better keep a cautious 
tongue in that viperous head of 
yours.” 

“Jet off, you blackmailin’ runt! 
Don’t try threatenin’ me. Don’t 
you realize 1 could finish you any 
time I chose?” 

“How’s that, honey-bitch?” 

“You fixed Bron’s psycho-syn- 
thesis and the semantic recall trig- 
gers — but I had a few tricks with 
Bron extendin’ way back before 
your time. Just one word from me 
could put Bron on the defensive — 
then he won’t cooperate no matter 
what you do. How you goin’ to 
survive that, Ananias?” 

“Get away from those controls, 
Jaycee. That’s an order.” 

“Go to hell, Ananias,” said 
Medic-commander Veeder. 

“When you’ve finished the in- 
fighting, perhaps you could spare 
me an observer.” Bron’s mocking 
voice broke suddenly through the 
speakers. “I’m going to try to get 
the coordinates from the subspace 
cavity.” 

“Engaged.” Jaycee forsook the 
argument and became quickly ab- 
sorbed in rapport with the screens, 
her hands delicately trimming the 
controls by sense of touch alone. 

“Full recordin’ facility on, Bron. 
I’m followin’.” 

Ananias shrugged resignedly and 
stalked toward the computer. On- 
ly when the ship coordinates had 
been firmly established and were 
ready for transpositions would he 
dare to interfere. But once

he did move, the results would 
have to be swift, massive and final. 
There was no room for mistakes 
nor for the toleration of opposi- 
tion at this stage of the game. Far 
too much had already gone wrong. 

VII 

T he call boards began to chime 
the reassembly call. Almost 
imperceptibly Bron began to feel 
the additional components of grav- 
ity as the main drive was run up to 
full power. Watching the pattern 
on the board, he waited for the 
alert of the subspace team and 
gave it time to reach stations be- 
fore he attempted to follow. It 
was obvious that the ship’s present 
mode of gravity drive was merely 
meant to provide steerage for a 
fast subspace passage. The situa- 
tion suggested that the matrices 
would be used as soon as they had 
been programed. 

He was nearing the end of his 
time of waiting. Soon he had to 
pick up — either from the chart- 
room or directly from the sub- 
space matrix — the coordinates 
that would betray the location of 
the Destroyer baseworld. At that 
point his own mission ended. The 
massed forces of the Stellar Com- 
mando, probably reinforced with 
the more spiteful dreadnoughts of 
the Terran Federation’s com- 
bined navies, would split whole star 
systems apart if necessary just to 
destroy the world the Destroyers 



had made the basis of their might. 

The battle would undoubtedly 
be the biggest space war in his- 
tory — its winners would become a 
legend. Bron doubted anyone . 
would ever see or hear again of a 
Commando called Bron who 
would have made the whole thing 
possible. At some point the in- 
credible nemesis awaiting Cana 
and his forces would catch up with 
the Destroyer ship in which Bron 
now traveled and his end would 
come. 

The lower corridors were almost 
empty and it was easy for him to 
pass through the minor gangways 
unobserved. Timing was im- 
portant — he dared not be too soon 
and he must not be too late. Even 
now the subspace team should be 
setting up its fantastic and deli- 
cate instruments to define the 
two points in space between which 
the ship would leap into the tach- 
yon quasidimension. 

Although of a design unfamiliar 
to Bron’s hypno-synthesis or his 
real memories, the entrance to 
the subspace installation bore 
the usual features dictated by the 
invariable principles of super- 
luminal mechanics. The positive 
air pressure forced a gale around 
him as he opened the hatch. In the 
access tunnel he allowed the cy- 
clone air streams to swirl about 
him, the boiling turbulence re- 
moving the more gross dust and 
lint on his garments. Somewhere 
in his awareness lurked a fa- 



54 



IF 




miliarity with subspace mechan- 
isms that bred caution rather than 
contempt. Not for a second did he 
attempt to disregard the elabor- 
ate precautions necessary to 
protect the delicate mechanisms 
in the cavity beyond. 

At the tunnel barrier he ex- 
changed his sandals for a pair of 
the soft, clinging shoes on the rack 
and carefully dragged on the flex- 
ible rubber suit, which clung to his 
body like a second skin. Although 
the suit was designed to ac- 
commodate a Destroyer uni- 
form, it would in no way encom- 
pass his gown. He was finally 
forced to discard the latter and 
proceed with the rubber hotly 
uncomfortable against his bare 
body. He passed through the sting- 
ing detergent sprays and rinses 
and then the dryer. Only' when this 
ritual had been carefully per- 
formed did he dare to penetrate 
beyond. 

The anteroom, where the sub- 
space crew would wait during the 
jump, was empty. Next came the 
labyrinth and beyond this the ma- 
trix cavity itself, always a place of 
darkness and wonder. Basically 
the cavity was nothing but a skele- 
tal box between the great elec- 
trodes, surrounded by a gallery 
from which the technicians 
worked. Within the box, created 
and maintained by the field con- 
ditions which gave the atmos- 
phere its green and awesome 
fluorescence, burned the billions 



upon billions of replica stars, a 
complete section of the cosmos 
in miniature. No illumination 
was permissible save for the lum- 
inescence of the field and the tech- 
nicians were too intent on work- 
ing to notice a watching shadow 
hard against the outer wall. Only 
their faces were visible, illumi- 
nated by the eerie glow, like a 
gaggle of witches engaged in 
some wild, black art. 

With infinite care and delicacy 
the micron-straight, hair-fine 
probes were being extended like 
nearly invisible copper strands 
across the star matrix, defining 
positions and axes and measuring 
critical paths, probing always 
through the infinitesimally small 
spaces between the patterns of 
ersatz stars. Slowly across the 
micro-universe they were weaving 
the copper webs which would de- 
fine the positions of entry and 
termination of their superlum- 
inal jump through tachyon space. 

B RON watched the work from 
knowledgeable eyes, his train- 
ing or programing — he had no 
way of telling which — enabling 
him to assess the various criteria 
and thus the progress of the oper- 
ation. Finally he judged it was 
time to move. 

“I’m going to try to pick up the 
coordinates soon, Jaycee. I’ll 
leave you to do the recording 
while I merely observe.” 

Engaged, Bron. 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



55 




Bron moved slowly around the 
perimeter gallery. If he was no- 
ticed at all by the subspace team 
they must either have assumed he 
was one of their own number or 
else that he had legitimate busi- 
ness in the cavity. In any event, 
nobody questioned his presence, 
and the painstaking work of 
aligning coordinates went on 
without interruption. When 
Bron was sure the final settings 
had been made he cautiously in- 
spect^ each gauge turret in turn. 
Despite his arrangement with 
Jaycee he silently filed the fig- 
ures from the dim digital indica- 
tors into a mnemonic key as he 
went. Jaycee, for her part, verbal- 
ly confirmed her reception of the 
sequences. 

“I’m getting out now, Jaycee. I 
have to get clear before the crew 
leaves. I don’t relish the idea of be- 
ing trapped in here during the 
jump. Have you got all the figures 
you need?” 

I think so. Well transpose back 
into real-space coordinates and 
get them on transmission im- 
mediately. 

Bron turned to negotiate the 
labyrinth. 

“I suppose you’ll be signing off 
soon? You’ve got all I came for.” 

We*re scheduled to maintain 
contact at least until we get con- 
firmation of the destruction of 
the baseworld. That's the 
GenStaff requirement. But I 
think Doc wants to keep the proj- 



ect going purely as a Comman- 
do exercise. Ananias has been 
playing a rather peculiar game — 
he's made us think there may be 
more in this affair than appears at 
the surface. 

Bron was swiftly stripping the 
rubber suit from his sweating 
body. “Tell me in a minute, Jay- 
cee. Looks as though they’re going 
to jump fast.” 

Behind him he could hear move- 
ments in the labyrinth as the sub- 
space crew vacated the cavity for 
the duration of the jump. He was 
well past the subspace anteroom, 
but still visible from its doorway. 
In the suit Bron had made an 
anonymous figure in the cavity 
darkness, but in his gown his iden- 
tity was unmistakable. Only by 
gaining the hatch before the first 
crewman emerged from the laby- 
rinth could he hope to conceal his 
intrusion. 

Even as the outer hatch was clos- 
ing he heard behind him a sudden 
buzz of conversation and the click 
of a communications handset. It 
was impossible to tell if this was a 
routine incident or whether he 
had been seen and his presence re- 
ported. Although his presence in 
the cavity in no way exceeded the 
license allowed him by Cana, the 
pattern of his interests was be- 
ginning to weigh heavily against 
his assumed pose as an academic 
syncretist. 

Now that the Commandos had 
the information they required. 



56 



IF 




Bron was free to try to mold for 
himself a pattern of survival if he 
could. Since he was sitting at what 
was calculated to be the losing 
end of one of the biggest project- 
ed space battles ever, his course 
was not easy to see. 

The subspace alert broke his de- 
liberations and forced him to look 
for safety straps. Most of the po- 
sitions were duty points, soon to 
be occupied by crewmen. He 
found a spare harness near the 
communications room and thrust 
his arms into it. So tightly did the 
Destroyers cut their pre-jump 
schedule that many of the crew- 
men made their positions with 
equally little time to spare. Then 
the ship jumped. The Destroyers 
obviously believed in making con- 
cessions neither to ship nor men 
when dealing with subspace. They 
slammed into it at full power, 
hard, fast and straight. Thirty- 
three seconds of gut-tearing, bone- 
straining agony, during which their 
craft was slipped through the light- 
barrier to be hurled at superlumi- 
nal velocities across the galaxy. 

Bron knew from subspace theory 
what his conscious mind refused 
to accept — that by a process of in- 
volution the ship had in reality 
disappeared from the space-time 
continuum entirely and now ac- 
tually moved between the webs of 
its own ersatz galaxy in the sub- 
space cavity deep within its own 
guts. Stories still survived of 
spacemen who claimed to have 



seen the copper bars straddling the 
stars at the end of a subspace 
jump. Bron was not certain about 
this, but he did know that techni- 
cians caught in the subspace cavity 
during the jump had observed the 
ionization trail of their own ship 
speeding from web to web. Those 
of them, that is, who managed to 
recover from the shock. 

T he ship dropped into the quies- 
cent phase of the jump and the 
tearing pressures eased. The 
heavy thunder of the grav drive 
was replaced by the eerie song of 
the fantastically delicate sub- 
space drive. Bron unbuckled the 
harness and let it drop, finding 
suddenly that he was left with 
nothing specific to do but look for 
the one-in-ten-billion chance of 
survival. 

His situation was unenviable. He 
could do nothing that might en- 
danger the success of the Com- 
mandos — within these slim con- 
fines he was entitled to seek his 
own salvation. Yet who was he? 
Who was this parcel of human 
flesh upon whom so much seemed 
to have depended? 

In the quietness of his own 
cabinspace the question sudden- 
ly seemed of great importance to 
him. 

“Jaycee, now tell me about hie. 
What name did I have other than 
Bron?” 

None, Jaycee responded with 
quiet malice. You were found in a 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS

street market of Anhatine on 
Bela-six by a Terran trade delega- 
tion. They had chartered a scud- 
der and its descent blasted apart a 
pile of garbage. You were under- 
neath, four weeks old. / wish to 
God they*d left you there, but they 
picked you up because they were 
Terrans and therefore soft and 
squeamish about the destruction 
of young life. They took you with 
them to the spaceport from which 
they were due to travel offworld. 
Neither the police nor the customs 
were interested, so you were 
shipped to Terra, registered as a 
demonstration animal. How you 
got the name nobody knows, but it 
was probably the coded customs 
stamp on your livestock export 
documents. In a way it seems 
rather appropriate. 

“You aren’t lying to me are you, 
Jaycee?” 

No, it's all on file. On Terra your 
presence proved embarrassin to 
the dispersin' delegation. You 
were dumped in a para-military 
orphanage run by a Dr. Harves- 
tine. Harvestine was a patho- 
logical bully, but apparently a 
good teacher. By the age of seven 
you learned enough of the brutal 
arts to break the doctor's neck in 
unarmed combat. Only the Com- 
mando school seemed to offer the 
type of curriculum to which you'd 
been accustomed, so the courts 
sent you there. 

For the next fifteen years you 
took everythin' in the way of train- 



in' the commandos could fling at 
you. Both academically and 
militarily you persisted in corn- 
in' out on top. From weaponry 
through combat to higher mathe- 
matics you thrived on everythin' 
that was offered. But with one un- 
alterable characteristic — a ca- 
pacity for chaos. 

“Chaos?” 

Yes, Bron. The ability to play a 
system against itself until it 
breaks down and disintegrates. 
Then, when everyone is runnin in 
circles, guess who moves through 
the ruins engaged in furtherin' his 
own ends? 

“And that’s me?” 

That's you, Bron. Everythin' 
about you is chaos. Your personal 
life is chaos and the same thing 
happens to most of those with 
whom you get involved. You breed 
chaos and when the mess is thick 
enough you move in, pickin' the 
bits you think you want and then 
discardin' them when they don't 
provide whatever it is you're 
searchin' for. You do this with 
people as well as things — and with- 
out regard for the consequences. 

“Tell me, Jaycee, did we ever 
meet?” 

That's classified information, 
Bron. I can't answer you that. 

“Damn you. I’ll ask Doc.” 

You'll get the same answer from 
anyone. Our relationship is on a 
psycologically balanced basis 
and you or nothin' is goin to upset 
the balance. 



58 



IF 




“Don’t compute on that, Jaycee. 
If ever I make Terra again it’ll 
take more than the Stellar Com- 
mando to keep me from the ob- 
jective I have in mind right now.” 

The door opened abruptly and 
two armed crewmen gestured him 
out into the corridor. 

“Bron ’altern, Cana wants to see 
you. Come.” 

This time there was no attempt 
at respect. A curt order and a 
movement with a handgun were 
more an indication of an arrest 
than a request for company. Bron 
shrugged and turned as directed. 

“This looks like the end, Jay- 
cee,” he said subvocally. 

Vm bringing Doc on-line. If 
there s anythin we can do .. 

“You know the only damn thing 
you can do is kill me to stop my 
breaking under torture.” 



T he detail halted before Cana’s 
door, motioned for him to en- 
ter, then took stations outside, 
handguns ready. Cana was seated 
at his desk, a solitary figure deep 
in thought, chin in hands, elbows 
resting on a plane of polished 
wood. 

“Sit down, Syncretist,” he said. 
“I take it you’ve concluded your 
investigations on the origin of 
the missile.” 

Bron relaxed slightly. “I have.” 
“Having checked a reprint of 
your calculations, I can assure you 
that your answers coincide exactly 



with our own. The fact that you 
programed the computer using a 
weaponry format rather than the 
classical software has not escaped 
my notice. One wonders just how 
far syncretism extends.” 

His eyes looked into Bron’s with 
a questing comprehension that 
left Bron feeling weak. A slight 
smile surfaced on Cana’s lips. 

“You’re a man of many talents, 
Syncretist. And I don’t suppose 
we’ve seen all of them yet. But 
then, I should have expected noth- 
ing else from you.” 

“I don’t'understand.” 

Cana raised his eyebrows sagely. 
“I take it you’ve already decided 
where the missile came from.” 

“Of course. It originated either 
from a location in Messier Thir- 
ty-one some seven hundred mil- 
lion years ago or from a carrier 
somewhere in the void only a few 
hours before impact. From the 
location of your ring of ships at 
rendezvous, it is obvious that you 
know that a missile was going 
down on Onaris and knew in ad- 
vance the precise details of its tra- 
jectory.” 

“The implication being that the 
weapon carrier was mine and that 
the destruction of Onaris was an 
entertainment rigged mainly for 
your benefit?” 

“You read me correctly,” said 
Bron. Knowing both the nearness 
and the inevitability of death 
gave him a curiously fatalistic 
courage. 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



59 




“You’re no fool, Syncretist,’’ 
said Cana, “and you’re no megal- 
omaniac either. Ask yourself why 
the hell I would go to such lengths 
just to amuse you. The answer is 
that I wouldn’t. To reach the truth 
of the situation it is necessary to 
make an inversion. We didn’t an- 
ticipate that missile as much as it 
anticipated us. And its origin 
was in Messier Thirty-one.’’ 

“That I decline to believe. Have 
you tried to examine the implica- 
tions?’’ 

“Yes.’’ Cana maintained his 
intellectual calm. “The implica- 
tions are simply that seven hun- 
dred million years ago someone 
or something in Andromeda fore- 
saw the precise details of our raid 
on Onaris and our acquisition of 
you and took steps calculated to 
prevent our meeting. So fan- 
tastic were their calculations that 
they were positionally exact and 
only about sixteen hours late in 
time. It’s the same story almost 
wherever we go — but the time 
margin is becoming smaller. On 
present estimates we shall be able 
to get away with only four more 
raids. If we attempt a fifth, we 
shall still be there when the hell- 
burner arrives.’’ 

“Suppose you leave earlier — or 
change your destination?’’ 

“It makes no difference. It is the 
action we finally perform, not 
the decisions leading up to it, 
that is critical. If we plan a raid 
and abort our intention at the last 



4nstant, no missile appears. 
Sometime nobody but myself 
has known of the intention to 
abort a raid — yet seven hundred 
million years ago that whim of 
mine was anticipated. If we plan a 
target, then switch to an alterna- 
tive, it is to the alternative that the 
missile is directed — was directed — 
somewhere about the time that the 
first sparks of life were being 
struck in the Terran primitive 
soup. It’s like the ancient concept 
of fate, fixed and immutable, that 
waits for you no matter where you 
run.’’ 

“Insanity!” For a moment the 
Haltern synthesis flared. 

“Not insanity, Syncretist Bron 
Haltern — or whoever you may 
be.” Cana’s gaze was shrewd and 
unruffled. “Rather a matter of 
cause and effect. Initially we were 
primarily engaged in acquiring 
slaves, but among our intake was 
an inevitable percentage of in- 
digenous intelligentsia. These we 
employed on high-level tasks. 
Sometimes a missile followed 
these raids and sometimes it did 
not. Our computers threw up the 
curious correlation between our 
acquisition of certain specialist 
technocrats and the destruction 
of the world from which they had 
been taken. These peculiarly 
fatalistic individuals all had 
knowledge and potential in one 
Held of advanced cosmology — that 
of the patterns of chaos. Which 
brings us directly to you.” 



60 



IF 




“In what way?” 

“Seeing that our opportunities 
were running short, we made it 
our deliberate policy when raid- 
ing to acquire the best chaos men in 
the galaxy. Your reputation as 
an authority on the patterns of 
chaos ranks indisputably the 
highest and made you a natural 
candidate both for us and for the 
arrival of the missile where and 
when it fell. Only — ” 

“Only what?” 

“The missiles normally consist 
of three cylinders at most. For you 
they sent seven. From a distance 
of better than six hundred thou- 
sand parsecs and seven hundred 
million years in time they must 
have held your achievements, ac- 
tual or potential, in very high re- 
gard. What sort of things are you 
going to do, Syncretist, to real- 
ize that promise?” 



VIII 

A DISTURBANCE outside the 
door forestalled any answer 
Bron might have made. Daiquist's 
voice could be heard raised in 
angry argument with the guard de- 
tail. Cana keyed a switch on his 
desk and the door swung open. 

“Come in, Martin. They had 
their instructions not to let us be 
disturbed.” 

Daiquist strode into the room, 
followed by two junior officers. 
His face was red with fury. 



“You’ve got that damned syn- 
cretist here — ” 

“Certainly.” Cana regarded his 
fuming lieutenant speculatively. 
“What’s on your mind, Martin?” 

“He is. I thought he was a spy 
and now I’m certain of it.” 

Cana remained utterly calm. 
“You could be right, Martin. I, 
too, have my suspicions. But they 
may not be relevant. It’s no acci- 
dent that seven cylinders went 
down on Onaris. Spy or not, he’s 
certainly a prime chaos catalyst.” 

, “To hell with Catalysis. I don’t 
trust him. He’s too damned clever. 
He was snooping around in the 
subspace cavity just before the 
jump.” 

Cana stiffened. “Can you 
explain that, Syncretist?” 

“I was interested in how you 
programed for the jump. I have 
some subspace theories of my 
own.” 

“I have other theories,” said 
Daiquist, “and one of them is that 
you’re not Haltern. It would take 
me only a half-hour in the interro- 
gation room to get the truth from 
you.” 

“No.” Cana’s voice was sharp. 
“All the signs so far are that we’ve 
acquired in him a key piece of this 
entropy puzzle. Haltern or not, it 
doesn’t matter much. He appears 
to have the potential to fill what- 
ever catalytic role the patterns of 
chaos have already set. To put it 
bluntly, a large part of the future 
threatens to ride on his shoul-

ders — and the future would be 
better supported on a fit back 
than on a cripple’s.” 

“Then confine him to where he 
can’t get into any mischief — or I 
can’t be held responsibe for your 
safety or the safety of this ship.” 
“Very well.” Cana came to a 
sudden decision. “Break the 
jump, Martin, and put him aboard 
the nearest corvette.” 

Daiquist nodded his acceptance. 
“I’ve an even better idea. Let me 
put him on the Tantalus — and I’ll 
go with him. I’d be interested in 
seeing his reactions.” 

Cana considered some hidden 
implication in the proposal, 
nodded his approval. “I doubt 
you’re right, Martin, but there’s a 
slight chance we might learn some- 
thing. There has to be something 
very special about a man whose 
murder was considered so essen- 
tial seven million centuries ago.” 
Daiquist nodded curtly to his 
aides. “Take the Syncretist and 
lock him up. One of you is to stay 
with him at all times. I’ll have the 
jump halted. We should be ready 
to make transfer within the 
hour.” 

B RON was escorted to an emp- 
ty cabin and locked in with one 
of the aides. He lay back on the 
bunk and stared up at the ceiling. 
“Jaycee.” 

Dont talk to me, you pitiful 
cretin! 

“What the hell’s eating you?” 



If they discover now who you are 
it could ruin the whole exercise. 

“Spool the sermons, Jaycee. I 
need Ander, quick.” 

You need poisonin, quick. An- 
ders not here but Til try to con- 
tact him. What*s the readout? 

“I want a fast replay on this pat- 
terns of chaos business. Maybe 
Ander can make some sense out of 
it, but I’m damned if I can. Was 
Doc in on that last sequence?” 

On-line the whole way. When 
he'd finished his fingernails he 
started on mine. 

“Charming. What’s the general 
impression?” 

As we read it, the only thing 
that's keepin you alive is Cana's 
fear of somethin' else. God alone 
knows what that somethin' is, but 
it either exists or Cana's the big- 
gest nut of the millennium. 

“Cana’s no nut. He’s got a 
pretty powerful brain, but he’s 
well balanced. He’s at war with 
something and it isn’t just the Ter- 
ran Federation. So who or what 
the hell is it, Jaycee?” 

Sometimes I wonder if Ananias 
knows. He makes like a seasick 
dog at any mention of missiles 
from Messier 31. He won't hear of 
the idea. 

“I suspect there’s quite a lot that 
Ananias knows and won’t tell. Is 
he there now?” 

No. He ran yapping to Genstaff 
with the coordinates instead of 
letting them go on standard 
transmission. I think he has ideas

IF 




of taking you over personally. 
He hasnt been around long enough 
to know that workin with you 
isnt the sort of job you volunteer 
for. 

“I could almost wish he’d try. 
Any idea what kind of vessel the 
Tantalus might be? It seems to 
have some special significance 
for Daiquist and Cana.” 

Computer check through Intelli- 
gence records of known De- 
stroyer craft shows no listin. The 
only Tantalus that shows up any- 
where for the last fifty years is the 
Terran Army's deep-space labora- 
tory ship that got lost somehow a 
few years back on an experimen- 
tal voyage beyond the Rim. 

“See if you can get a bit of de- 
tail on it. Might throw up some- 
thing useful. I’d like a word with 
Doc if he’s still there.” 

Engaged, Bron. Doc Veeder’s 
precise voice fell in soft contrast 
to Jaycee’s edged tones. What's 
the readout? 

“Assuming for the moment that 
Cana is right about the seven cyl- 
inders on Onaris being intended 
specifically for Haltern, don’t 
forget that the man to whom they 
should have been addressed was 
Ander, not me. 1 don’t know what 
a chaos catalyst is — but if Cana 
isn’t mad or lying you could be 
sitting on some potential time- 
bomb-type events centered on An- 
der. I just thought the fact might 
have slipped your notice.” 

It did. We were concentrating so 



much on your end that we had for- 
gotten about the substitution. 
We're not yet convinced about this 
chaos business, but it might be as 
well to play safe. Any sugges- 
tions? 

“Yes. Keep him well guarded 
and hold him available for com- 
munication over the transfer 
link. As I see it, something big is 
going to happen and he may well 
be the one person who can make 
sense of it all. I suggest you put a 
computer on full-time coinci- 
dence checking and feed every 
atom of even seemingly relevant 
data to it. This whole business has 
a decidedly off-beat feeling 
about it.” 

I don't follow you, but I'll do as 
you suggest. I'll stay on-line for a 
bit in case anything new develops. 

B ron relaxed and closed his 
eyes. The aide guarding him 
toyed with his drawn sidearm at 
the table. Both men waited in si- 
lence for the end of the jump and 
for the next round of action to be- 
gin. 

Bron, his questing mind search- 
ing for some stimulus to bridge the 
hiatus, pushed his perception past 
the star static and the carrier hiss 
of the link circuit intruding from 
under his awareness threshold — 
and found something else. Some- 
thing that, though he knew its 
shadows, he was completely un- 
prepared to face — the goose-mut- 
ter, the phantom sound of liquid 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



63 




geese — but louder this time, near- 
er, and with an articulate and an- 
gry urgency that chilled him to the 
marrow. His mind’s initial reac- 
tion was to recoil in shock, but his 
analytical faculty forced him to 
seek some explanation. 

A glutinous, viscous, thixotropic 
foam of a sound, its incomprehen- 
sible yet meaningful babble struck 
him with all the implied urgency 
and horror of an unalterable disas- 
ter bearing down. Again his imag- 
ination fled, life-supported on an 
intangible raft, down the waters of 
some subterranean Styx, gather- 
ing shadows where there was no 
light and gathering sounds, the 
origin of which he dared not imag- 
ine. He felt the motion of the wash 
rippling gently at the breaking of 
some slight turbulence and sensed 
his own slow and measureless pro- 
gression down the tunnel toward 
its end. What end? What lay 
around the dark bends of that ter- 
rible river? Fantasies more ter- 
rible than death reared up out of 
the shades of his imagination. 

His unashamed scream coincid- 
ed exactly with the shrill of the 
break-jump alert and a few sec- 
onds later the liquid geese were 
washed away in the intricate 
agonies of the end of the subspace 
jump. 

L eaning past his escort as 
<^the tender left its monstrous 
parent’s womb, Bron grasped the 
Hockung lens and brought it to 



bear on their destination. Space- 
worthy though she must be, the 
Tantalus bore none of the look of 
bronzed efficiency that char- 
acterized Destroyer ships. Rather 
she looked to have been dipped in 
whitewash that had lost its ad- 
hesion and bulged and sagged and 
stripped. Nor had she the trim out- 
line of a naval craft, being squat 
and ugly and with a hindpart made 
hideous and complex by the de- 
vices of a dozen different drive 
systems. If her hull had once had 
her name emblazoned on it, the 
legend had long since succumbed 
to the attrition of space and to cor- 
rosion and pitting. 

“Terran,” said Bron subvocally, 
returning the Hockung lens to 
the navigator of the tender. 

Check, Bron. Looks as though it 
is the Armys long-lost deep-space 
lab. There's a print from Records 
just cornin' through, so we can run 
a comparison to see if she's been 
modified as a hellburner carrier. 

“I doubt it. Even if she were cap- 
able of throwing a device like that 
I don’t see how she could have 
achieved an accuracy of plus or 
minus a meter over that sort of 
range.” 

Somebody did. 

From a closer view it was pos- 
sible to see the effect of the 
ravages to which the hull of the 
Tantalus must at some time have 
been subjected. Huge pits and 
whorls had penetrated an arm’s 
thickness into the metal in a man- 



64 



IF 




ner suggesting she had been pres- 
sure-hosed with acid. In places the 
very metal itself seemed to have 
delaminated and the random 
curls and blisters of the outer skin 
in the process of detachment lent 
the ship a diseased and infected 
air. However, her docking equip- 
ment functioned efficiently enough 
and Bron, followed by Daiquist 
and the two aides, stepped through 
the lock into the warm, trim and 
quaintly outdated interior. 

Bron stopped suddenly, his scalp 
prickling. 

What is it, Bron? 

“Something’s awfully wrong 
here. This ship has a very queer feel 
about it.” 

What kind of wrong? 

“The weird kind. I can’t define 
it. Has the Tantalus been modi- 
fied?” 

Not as far as we can tell. But she 
did carry conventional weap- 
onry — as do all Army ships — and 
these include Terran hellburri- 
ers of the Nemesis class. 

“The burner that went down on 
Onaris would have made the 
punch of. a Nemesis feel like a 
love bite. Anyway, there was noth- 
ing human in the design of that 
damn thing.” 

Meanin that you re acceptin 
Cana's point of view that the On- 
aris burner was both aged and 
alien. She was coldly critical. 
Why the hell don't you — 

“Spool it, Jaycee! I’m not ac- 
cepting anything. I’m saying that 



if what I smell is right we’re so far 
out of our depth that even if we 
sank at twenty-G acceleration 
we’d never touch bottom.” 

How do you compute that? 

“I’ve just realized what’s wrong 
with this ship. It isn’t the Tantalus 
at all — at least, not the one that 
was built. It’s a bloody mirror 
image.” 

Make a little sense, Bron. 

“Look at the dials and gauges. 
Look at the labels. Everything. 
Lateral inversion complete to 
the last detail. This isn’t a Cana 
stage trick, Jaycee. This is real.” 

Bron became aware suddenly 
that Daiquist was watching him 
with a fixed concentration that 
was actively hostile. Jaycee 
picked up the same point simul- 
taneously. 

Watch out for Daiquist, Bron. I 
think he's trying to use the Tan- 
talus to prove you're a Terran 
agent. Show any familiarity and 
you'll betray yourself. 

“Have the coordinates gone out 
on general transmission yet?” 

Don't know. Ananias isn't back. 
Why? 

“As soon as the Terran task 
force is under way and the plan 
can’t be jeopardized I may have to 
kill Daiquist.” 



J AYCEE started to speak but 
quieted suddenly to allow Bron 
to concentrate as Daiquist turned 
back toward him. 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



65 




“You’re looking puzzled, Bron 
Haltern.’’ 

“This ship — it’s not Destroyer 
manufacture?” 

“No. Terran. A bit of cosmic 
flotsam we picked out of the void. 
It has its uses.” 

“Do Terrans always read meters 
backwards?” 

“No. That’s just a fragment of 
chaos. As a specialist in the field, 
it shouldn’t perturb you unduly.” 

Bron broke away from the en- 
counter with a shrug. Nothing in 
his own training or in the Haltern 
synthesis had prepared him with 
an answer. Daiquist’s interest in’ 
pursuing the subject was broken 
as the subspace alert signaled the 
resumption of the jump. Unlike 
the Destroyer vessel, the Tan- 
talus slipped into subspace with a 
mere shiver which was so soft as to 
be almost sensuous. 

As they moved into the quies- 
cent phase Bron began to get his 
bearings and started walking ap- 
parently aimlessly through the 
ship’s main installations. He 
hoped an outward display of aca- 
demic interest was in keeping 
with his pose as a syncretist. In- 
wardly he was looking for vital 
threads that might aid his own sur- 
vival. 

The Tantalus was a small vessel 
with perhaps only a hundredth 
part of the displacement of one of 
Cana’s fleshholding spatial dread- 
noughts. Since it was only lightly 
armed and, from its condition. 



scarcely capable of withstanding 
an attack, it occurred to Bron to 
wonder exactly what its function 
was in the fleet. Its laboratory fa- 
cilities were well maintained and in 
use and it was crewed by an unusu- 
ally high proportion of high-rank- 
ing technicians and even a few ci- 
vilians. Their interest in his arrival 
ran in strong contrast to Dai- 
quist’s dour suspicion. 

Daiquist shadowed him silently 
for a while, then approached and 
took his arm. “Come, I want you 
to meet the captain — Academi- 
cian Laaris.” 

The captain was as untypical of 
Destroyer personnel as the Tan- 
talus was of their fleet. His chart- 
room was a mess of improvised 
instrumentation, among which 
he moved with the agility of a 
sprite. He was small and dark and 
his bright eyes glinted with 
shrewdness. With only a formal 
acknowledgment of Daiquist, 
he forcibly crossed the veins of his 
wrist with Bron’s in the Destroyer 
familiar greeting. 

“Mastership ’altern, for you I 
die!” 

Bron’s surprise at the greeting 
must have been reflected in his 
face, for Laaris smiled broadly. 

“No, we ’ave not met, but I 
know you well. Everyone who 
works on chaos knows you. The 
paper you gave at Maroc on Priam 
is almost our standard tex’.” 

Bron could not resist the ques- 
tion. “Is that what you’re doing on 



66 



IF 




the Tantalus — research into the 
patterns of chaos?” 

“But of course.” For a moment 
Laaris looked perplexed. “Is that 
no’ why you come?” 

“I don’t think so.” Bron glanced 
at Daiquist and waited to hear the 
colonel’s explanation. 

“Haltern’s not here of his own 
free will. He’s a prisoner and, we 
suspect, a spy. For that reason 
he’s under open arrest. Watch 
him. Captain. He’s a dangerous 
man.” 

Laaris’s face was crossed by a 
bafflement which was rapidly re- 
placed by a smile of relief. “The 
science of chaos is intergalactic. 
It is you, Colonel, who fail to 
comprehen’ the liaison between 
scientific minds. Come ’altern, I 
will find you cabinspace. Later we 
can talk chaos.” 

I N HIS new cabinspace, away 
from Daiquist’s prying eyes, 
Bron’s contact was urgent. 

“Jaycee, for God’s sake — 
haven’t you got Ander yet? Either 
I talk chaos with an expert or Dai- 
quist is set to take me apart.” 
Ander s been located, Bron. We 
should have him soon. 

“Are the coordinates on trans- 
mission yet?” 

Ananias has just come in. 77/ 
ask — 

“Put him on-line. Things are be- 
coming critical fast ” 

I dont trust Ananias near the 
control board. 



“Damn you, Jaycee. Do as 
you’re told.” 

Well spoken, Bron. Ananias’s in- 
sinuating tones took over. Glad 
to find Tm not the only one who 
has trouble with Honey-bitch. 

“Spool it, Ananias. Did the co- 
ordinates go out yet?” 

That*s GenStaff s business. 

“And mine. I’m going to have to 
make a move soon. If I move too 
fast the whole Destroyer pack 
will scatter like a shoal of startled 
fish.” 

You overestimate yourself, little 
soldier. 

“No, but I underestimated you. 
Look around me, Ananias. Do 
you see where I am?” 

On another vessel. Terran, I 
would guess. 

“You’re not guessing, Ananias. 
You damn well know. The Lab- 
Ship Tantalus, no less.” 

Is that supposed to mean some- 
thing to me? 

“As 1 begin to recall it, yes. Are 
you listening, Jaycee?” 

On-line, Bron. 

“This amnesia seems to be 
catching. Run a replay of the 
crewlist of the last recorded voy- 
age of the Tantalus.'* 

Don't bother. Ananias’s voice 
was swift and angry. I'll admit it 
lists me. But you've gone over the 
edge, Bron. I'm warning you to 
stay quiet. Don't be a damn fool. 

“Listen, Ananias, from now on 
this operation’s going to be 
handled my way. You’re going to

cooperate, because you haven’t 
the character to stand the stigma 
of being branded as a freak.” 

The sharp noise of a scuffle 
penetrated the transfer link. 
Then somebody screamed with 
pain. 

It*s all right, Bron. Vm holdin 
him. He tried to hit the murder 
button, so I dislocated both his 
thumbs. Give us the readout. Wed 
better have the information this 
end so we can use it in case any- 
thin happens to you. 

“Yes, you had better. Colonel 
Ananias, as he was then, com- 
manded the Tantalus on the voy- 
age during which she was lost. As 
sole survivor he made Terra two 
years later on a stellar tramp and 
claimed he was beaten out of 
space by a Destroyer task force.” 

It was the truth. Ananias’s 
pained protest carried distinctly. 

“I doubt it,” said Bron. “The 
damage done to this ship was 
never done by any Destroyer. It’s 
my guess you fled out of the void 
when something unnamable over- 
took you. I think you abandoned 
the Tantalus somewhere to make 
the story hold, then transhipped to 
Terra on a tramp. I hate to think 
what became of the crew.” 

You don t have a single shred of 
proof. 

“I don’t, but I think you have. 
Jaycee, you’ve probably slept with 
him. Was there nothing unusual?” 
He*s a Godlost weaklin — but 
thaTs nothin unusual. Jaycee’s 



contempt was as sharp as a whip- 
lash. What you meanin , Bron? 

“Feel under his shirt, Jaycee. 
If my idea is true you’ll find his 
heart on the right side instead of 
on the left — where it was when he 
was born. I think he became in- 
verted at the same time as the 
Tantalus. And whatever caused 
the phenomenon had nothing to 
do with a human agency.” 

IX 

R^N, Tve got A nder for you. 
“Put him on-line, Jaycee. He’s 
got about five minutes to bring me 
up to mastership standard in the 
theory and practice of chaos.” 

A nder speaking. I do what I 
can. But I can only give you bar- 
est outline. 

“Reading you, Ander. That 
will have to suffice. What is this 
thing called chaos?” 

The whole spectrum of cause 
and effect, from the subnuclear 
to the galactic, considered not 
as connected incidents but from 
an entropic standpoint — as a 
random dynamic fluid. 

“I can see the concept, but not 
how you can use it.” 

I come to that. First let me es- 
tablish the importance of time as 
a factor. ITs a fundamental ten- 
et of the universe that entropy in- 
creases with time. The only ex- 
ception is intervention by some 
form of intelligence, such as 
Mans, which can locally de- 




68 



IF 




crease entropy or accelerate its 
rate several orders above the 
norm. 

A knock at the door signaled 
for Bron’s attention. Shrugging 
his gown to the floor, he went to 
the door and opened it. 

“Mastership ’aitern, Aca- 
demician Laaris would be please’ 
for you to join ’im urgently.” 

“As soon as I have finished my 
ablutions I shall be ready.” Bron 
freely amplified the weak sug- 
gestions of Haltern intoler- 
ance. “Tell him I come soon.” 
Securing the latch, he returned 
to the watcher in his head. 

“Carry on, Ander. I read the 
words so far.” 

Dont need them, learn them. 
They* re important. All chaos 
calculations are made against 
quantized time and can be either 
prognostic or retrospective ac- 
cording to the sign. They can be 
used to predict the future or to ex- 
amine the elements of the past 
which have had a significant bear- 
ing on the present. 

“But having randomized all 
your factors, I don’t see how it’s 
possible to determine anything 
by mathematical treatment.” 
Imagine a container of fluid. 
“Your entropic system — mole- 
cules in random motion?” 

Exactly. You should have been 
scholar, not soldier. The pres- 
sure of the fluid is due to the ran- 
dom collision and rebounding of 
molecules with each other and 



with the walls of the container. In 
the hypothetical fluid we call 
chaos the molecules are replaced 
by events and the events interact 
with each other just as do mole- 
cules. 

“Keep going, Ander. I’m still 
with you. But I’m fast running out 
of time.” Bron found the shower 
and ran it noisily. “Daiquist’ll 
come looking if I don’t show up 
soon. I wonder what the panic 
is.” 

/ must lead you through this part 
carefully. Not understanding it 
could be fatal for you. Suppose 
your container initially had in- 
homogeneous areas of fluid at 
different temperatures? 

“They would mix by diffusion. 
The energy of the system would 
remain the same, but the entropy 
would slowly increase.” 

Thus you have a fair analogue 
of the condition of the universe. 

A nother knock, heavier 
than the last, came at the 
door. This time Bron went stark 
naked and trailing water in his 
wake. Daiquist stood outside, 
stern, suspicious and angry. He 
seemed somewhat mollified to find 
that the promised ablutions were 
actually taking place. 

“You’re taking a damn long 
time, Syncretist. You’re needed 
in the chartroom.” 

“The dust of the Destroyers is 
uncommonly hard to remove.” 
Bron turned his back on the col- 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



69 




onel and stalked back to the show- 
er. Daiquist came into the room 
and stood impatiently. 

“I’ll wait until you’re finished. 
You’d better hurry. Laaris needs 
you.” 

“Ander, this is going to be 
tricky. Keep talking.” Subvocal- 

ly- 

If you can grasp the next point 
we're nearly there. In your con- 
tainer, what would be the effect of 
heating or cooling small areas of 
the fluid? 

“Obviously local accelerations 
or decelerations of entropy.” 
Bron switched on the driers in the 
cubicle. 

And in our chaos fluid, what 
could be the only cause of the chaos 
analogue? I've already given you 
the answer once. 

“You mean intervention by 
some form of intelligence such as 
Man’s?” 

Precisely, Bron. Home and dry. 
Events precipitated by intelli- 
gent intervention invariably 
lead to alterations in local en- 
tropy and these can usually be de- 
tected by entropic analysis. Go- 
ing back to our analogy, this cor- 
responds to local heating or 
cooling of points in the fluid. If it 
occurred in an actual fluid it 
could be detected in a number of 
ways according to its sign and in- 
tensity — optically, as a local 
change in diffraction: audibly, 
perhaps as an explosion or a 
cavitation implosion: physical- 



ly, as a shock- wave or pressure 
difference. 

“And in your theoretical chaos 
fluid?” 

An effect similar to that of a 
spherical shock-wave spreading 
out from the point of origin — con- 
tinuously growing, continu- 
ously falling in intensity. It is 
observable only as minute rip- 
ples in the long tides of entropy. 
It's the inter-ripple and interfer- 
ence of these entropic wave fronts 
that we call the patterns of chaos. 

Daiquist was pacing the floor 
angrily. He was obviously unused 
to being disobeyed and was dis- 
tressed by an unstated urgency. 
Bron drew on his undergarments 
and then his gown, carefully sub- 
vocalizing so that his attentive 
antagonist should receive no 
sign. 

“But how do you detect the rip- 
ples?” 

Detection is the least of the prob- 
lems. A detector can be as sim- 
ple as an iron diaphragm in an 
oxygen atmosphere. Given a 
measuring system sensitive 
enough to show the acceleration 
or deceleration of its natural 
entropic change, it*s fairly easy 
to see the ripples pass. But the 
mathematical analysis of these 
ripples into meaningful points 
of time and place is difficult. 

Bron creased his brow. His con- 
versation must cease in seconds 
and he would then need to adopt 
the pose of an expert. But he dared 



70 



IF 




delay no longer. Daiquist drew 
his firearm and gestured for Bron 
to precede him along the corri- 
dor. Yet Bron’s questions still 
needed urgent answer. 

“Stay on-line, Ander. You 
spoke of cause and effect. I can see 
how you can locate the incident 
that was the cause of something, 
but what about locating the ef- 
fect?” 

The one is only the converse of 
the other. There is no difference 
between them except for the di- 
rection in which you read time. 
Youll be familiar with that con- 
cept from your studies of the fun- 
damental particles. Both cause 
and effect make detectable en- 
tropic * sparks' that become the 
centers of expanding shock 
spheres. If you can analyze enough 
of the sphere to be able to deter- 
mine the radius of its curvature 
and its intensity you can locate 
the position of a cause or result- 
ant both in space and time by ex- 
trapolating along the geocen- 
tric axis. But mark this: the signif- 
icant thing about a linked cause 
and resultant is that those two 
correlated events, and those 
alone, will have coincident axes. 
If you can locate the one you can 
usually find the other. 

I N THE chartroom the impish 
Academician Laaris had some- 
how lost his vivacity under a 
cloud of concern. Even his techni- 
cians, who had formerly shared 



his interest in the syncretist’s ar- 
rival, were now too dumbly at- 
tentive to their boards to mark 
Bron’s entrance. Instead of an air 
of academic interest, the at- 
mosphere was charged with dis- 
belief and panic. 

“ ’altern!” Laaris almost split 
himself with relief on seeing 
Bron. “ ’altern, this you ’ave to ex- 
plain.” He seized a ten-meter 
length of chart strip and tore it 
from the recorder. “Such a cha- 
os wave as this we ’ave never seen 
before.” 

Bron took the chart strip and be- 
gan to explore along it. The mul- 
ticolored lines started with slow 
excursions, gentle ripples on an 
abstract shore, part of the ever- 
pulsing patterns of chaos. Then a 
red trace broke away from its fel- 
lows, crossed the logarithmic 
scale to near infinity and was ap- 
parently arrested even there on- 
ly by the inability of the luckless 
instrument to follow it farther. 
For several meters the errant 
trace fought the stop-post on the 
meter. Then, even more abruptly 
than it had arisen, the trace fell 
straight across the graph and dis- 
appeared below absolute zero. 

Somebody said. Holy Moses! 
deep inside Bron’s head. 

Subvocally: “Did you see that, 
Ander? I need answers fast.” 

I don't have any. I need more in- 
formation about the computer 
scan to be certain. 

Laaris was upon Bron, almost

dancing with impatience to hear 
the sage explain. The Haltern 
synthesis stood mute. 

“Academician Laaris, can you 
first define the parameters of 
your computer scan?” 

“Scan? Scan?” The little man 
almost hopped with despair. 
“You don’ need computer scan to 
answer tha’.” 

“You forget,” said Bron Hal- 
tern coldly, “that your informa- 
tion is presented in Destroyer 
conventions, not mine.” 

“But always,” expostulated. La- 
aris, “the red line is your refer- 
ence baseline. ‘Ere it is the line 
representing this ship as a refer- 
ence point. Where ’as it gone? 
Where went my ship?” 

Ander said. Have it now, Bron, 
and began to pour information 
into his head. Bron considered 
the import of the words as he re- 
read the last appearance of the 
red line. 

“You don’t need me to tell you,” 
he said at last to Laaris. “You 
know the answer as well as I. We 
have just entered a chaos-effect 
shock sphere and are proceeding 
directly down a coincident ax- 
is to the point of origin — which 
will be this vessel’s complete an- 
nihilation.” 

Laaris looked up gratefully. 
“You, too, ’altern, say the same as 
I. I thought I was mistaken. Be- 
cause 1 don’ see how i’s possible 
for the vessel itself to be on coin- 
ciden’ axis unless somethin’ 



aboard was also the cause of the 
annihilation.” 

“Curious you should say that,” 
said Daiquist, picking up his gun 
and looking at Bron meaningly. 
“Because that’s the one point 
about which I’d never had a 
doubt.” 

D aiquist motioned to a cou- 
ple of the crew. “Look after 
the syncretist while I get this sorted 
out.” He turned back to Laaris. 
“Am I to understand the chaos 
evidence means this ship is set for 
destruction?” 

“There’s no doubt abou’ i’.” 
“From what cause?” 

“That I can’ say. The causal 
wave ’as not shown up. Perhaps if 
we reset the scan — ” 

“There’s no time. I’ve seen how 
accurate chaos evidence can 
be.” He waved an arm in Bron’s di- 
rection. “Lock him up some- 
where.” 

Bron submitted, reading the 
underlying perplexity on Laar- 
is’s brow and equating it with his 
own. 

“Ander, tape me in, will you. 
We’ve seen an effect wave, but La- 
aris says the causal wave has not 
shown up. Can you have an effect 
without a cause? If not, why 
haven’t we seen the wave?” 

We will, Bron. 

“What do you mean?” 

It had me stumped at first. La- 
aris had a prognostic scan set up 
on his computer and was reading 



72 



IF 




a future event, the cause of which 
is missing. It*s a highly unique 
situation even in chaos work, but 
it can happen. The simple an- 
swer is that the cause hasnt yet 
happened. 

“But neither has the effect ac- 
tually happened yet,” protested 
Bron. 

You re not thinking good chaos, 
Bron. The destruction of the Tan- 
talus is an event already fixed in 
the entropic patterns. ITs im- 
possible to alter that fact. But 
the means by which you are going 
to achieve its destruction have not 
yet been determined and there- 
fore have as yet no precise point in 
the patterns. 

“The means by which I am go- 
ing to achieve its destruction?” 

Yes, Bron. You're the other end 
of the coincident axes. You're 
the catalyst that is going to initi- 
ate the entropic change. 

“Not the Stellar fleet, then?” 

No, or there would already have 
been a wavefront corresponding 
to their decision to attack. In 
fact, from the absence of extrane- 
ous lines I'd say the Stellar Com- 
mando fleet was not even going to 
get there. 

Jaycee on-line, Bron. I just 
caught the trailing end of that con- 
versation and it computes 
straight. The Commando raid has 
been aborted. Disappointment 
weighted her every word. 

Bron was staggered. “You have 
to be joking — ” 



The coordinates turned out to be 
Brick's World — an early settle- 
ment planet colonized during 
the Great Exodus. It's a farm 
planet, lacking mineral re- 
sources. Definitely not a De- 
stroyer baseworld. GenStaff 
reckons the Destroyers use it for 
reprovisioning, but if they do 
they don't stay for more than a few 
hours. By the time we could get a 
fleet there the Destroyers could 
be anywhere in space. 

“So the mission’s a failure?” 

We're going to keep riding with 
you in case something shows up, 
but officially the game is over. 

“I’m glad you said that, Jaycee. 
I’m rapidly coming to the point 
where I’m going to have to take 
the initiative myself. Is Anani- 
as around?” 

He's down with the medic, hav- 
in' his thumbs put back in joint. 
Don't think he'll be doin' any 
maulin' for a few days. Doc's still 
fightin GenStaff over him, but it 
looks as if Ananias might win. 

“I haven’t finished with Gener- 
al Ananias. There’s a check you 
can run for me, Jaycee. Find out 
how much of the equipment we’ve 
seen on the Tantalus is Terran 
original. Ananias used to com- 
mand Tantalus, so I want to 
know how much access he might 
have had to chaos informa- 
tion.” 

Which channel you readin' , 
Bron? 

“I want to know how much of

this project he could possibly 
have foreseen, given the right 
know-how.” 

Engaged, 77/ give you the read- 
out as soon as it comes in. / could 
rather enjoy reducin' that bas- 
tard to a jelly. 



T he break-jump alert sounded 
shrilly. The Tantalus slipped 
out of subspace almost imper- 
ceptibly, in contrast to the sub- 
tle agonies of the Destroyer ma- 
neuver. Bron waited impatiently 
for release from the cabin in 
which he had been locked — he 
heard indications of the ship’s 
being abandoned. At last the 
proximity lock responded to an 
unseen hand. Daiquist stood at 
the door. 

■^‘You have Academician Laar- 
is to thank for this. I’d have been 
content to let you rot. But he was 
so impressed by your interpreta- 
tion of his chaos graphs that he in- 
sists that you have the freedom of 
the facilities which he is unable 
to employ.” 

“Unable?” 

“On chaos evidence, this ship is 
set for destruction. We’ve taken 
Laaris and his crew to another 
ship for safety. You’ll remain 
aboard with a skeleton crew who 
will place the Tantalus into a 
safe orbit. If the Tantalus sur- 
vives that long you’ll be fetched 
down and held until Cana decides 



what to do with you. The skeleton 
crew has instructions to shoot you 
if you attempt to interfere with 
the running of the ship. Apart 
from that you’re free to make your 
own way to hell.” 

Thoughtfully Bron watched the 
last tender leave. The only men 
who were left aboard the Tantal- 
us were hard-lipped Destroyer 
shipmen, clannish technological 
animals, molded in the inbuilt 
ruthlessness that characterized 
Destroyer operations. Bron ig- 
nored them and made for the com- 
puter terminal, his mind beginning 
to play with the several possibil- 
ities the situation presented. Never- 
theless he waited until the Tantalus 
was actually back in subspace be- 
fore he dared to make any kind of 
move. 

Actuating a programer, he be- 
gan to key figures into the input, 
working by touch on the lateral- 
ly inverted keyboard and delib- 
erately avoiding watching either 
his own fingers or the acceptance 
readout. 

What you doin', Bron? 
“Exercising my fingers. There 
are a few throats I’ve got to keep 
them in trim for.” 

Her voice grew taut. Let me see 
those figures for the recorders. 
You know the rules. 

“Spool it, Jaycee. You had your 
run and it got us nowhere. Now jet 
off while I do it my way.” 

Are you defy in' me, Bron? Her 
voice was archly incredulous.

“I don’t give a damn about you. 
Go ply your bitchiness where it’s 
appreciated.” 

/ said let me see those figures, 
Bron. I dont want to have to use 
the punishment circuits on you. 

“Don’t fool yourself. You’d just 
love the opportunity. It’s the 
justification you’re lacking.” 

She did not respond. 

The program completed, he ac- 
tivated the transfer of the data to 
the computing complex unex- 
amined, not wishing to expose his 
position by scanning the tape for 
the benefit of Jaycee’s record- 
ers. 

rm warnin’ you, Bron. Perhaps 
you’ve forgotten what sort of bite 
/ can apply. 

“Call Doc, Jaycee,” said Bron 
wearily. “If I’ve forgotten, he’ll 
no doubt remind me.” 

He was now watching the inter- 
mediate readouts as the compu- 
ter fled through the calculations. 
Over the transfer link he could 
hear Jaycee’s voice raised in vi- 
triolic protest. Then the voice of 
Doc came clear upon the air. 

What the hell’s this about, Bron. 
You should know better than to 
cross Jaycee. He sounded in- 
finitely tired. 

“Turn off the recorders. Doc, 
and listen. What kind of game is 
Ananias playing?” 

You’re not alone in wondering. 
He must have a personal deity on 
the General Staff to allow him to 
get away with what he does. In an- 



swer to your earlier question, it 
seems he did have access to a lot of 
chaos equipment. 

“Was it he who suggested the 
Destroyers should be allowed to 
raid Onaris unmolested?” 

Yes — ’but it was in accordance 
with the outline plan. 

Bron watched the readouts with 
growing comprehension. “Was 
the Onaris hellburner in the plan 
too?” 

No. That was something we 
hadn’t foreseen. We wouldn’t have 
let the Destroyers hit Onaris if 
we’d known about that. 

“You wouldn’t, perhaps. But 
what about Ananias?” 

Naturally not — 

“There’s nothing natural 
about it — or him.” Bron saw the 
“calculation complete” signal 
come up on the board and acti- 
vated the printout. 

“I have a theory that Ananias 
knew that hellburner was going 
to go down on Onaris and I think 
he knew it a long time ago. I think 
he knew it as surely as he knew 
where and when the Destroyers 
were going to pick me up. Don’t 
underestimate Ananias. He 
knew in advance that the De- 
stroyers’ subspace coordinates 
would not ever lead to Brick’s 
World.” 

But they did. 

“No, Doc, they didn’t. Ananias 
double-crossed you.”

RAT 



HARRY HARRISON 



The Stainless Steel Rat 
could do few things right- 
but nothing at all wrong! 




I carried an attache case filled 
with the usual things — grenades, 
gas bombs, explosives, nose 
filters, a gun or two — just the 
normal tools of the trade. My back 
was straight, my shoulders square 
and I entered the paymaster’s of- 
fice in a most martial manner if 
only to do the uniform justice — a 
spanking new goldstriped and be- 
ribboned uniform of a command- 
er in the United States Navy. 

“Good morning,” I snapped 
briskly, closing the door behind 
me and locking it at the same 
time, swiftly and silently, with the 
tool concealed in my hand. 

“Yes, sir.” 

The grizzled chief petty officer 
behind the desk spoke politely 
enough but it was obvious that his 
attention was rreally upon his 
work, the papers piled neatly up- 
on his desk, and strange officers 
simply had to wait their turn. Just 
as sergeants do in all armies, the 
chiefs run the navies. Sailors hur- 
ried about on naval financial mat- 
ters and through a doorway op- 
posite I had a view of the gape- 
mouthed gray form of a govern- 
ment issue safe. Lovely. I put my 
case on the chief’s desk and snap- 
ped it open. 

“I read about it in the newspa- 
per,” I said. “About how the mili- 

78 



tary always rounds its figures up- 
ward to the next million or billion 
dollars when asking for appropria- 
tions. I admire that.” 

“Aye aye, sir,” the chief mut- 
tered, his fingers punishing the 
comptometer keys, uninterest- 
ed in either my reading ability or 
in any comments from the press. 

“I thought you would be inter- 
ested. But that gave me the idea. 
Share the wealth. With such liber- 
ality there should be plenty to 
spare for me. That is why I am go- 
ing to shoot you. Chief.” 

That got his attention. I wait- 
ed until the eyewidening and jaw- 
gaping reached their maximum, 
then pulled the trigger on the long 
barreled pistol. It went shoof and 
thudded in my hand and the chief 
grunted and slipped from sight 
behind the desk. All of this had 
taken but a moment and the 
others in the office were just be- 
coming aware that something was 
wrong when I turned and picked 
them off one by one. Stepping 
over the litter of bodies, I poked 
my head into the inner office and 
called out. 

“Hoo-hoo, Captain, I see you.” 

He turned from the safe, 
growling some nautical oath, and 
caught the needle in the side of his 
neck. He folded as quickly as the 
others. My drug is potent, swift 
and soporific. Already snores were

rising from the room behind me. 
The payroll was there, stacks of 
crisp bills arranged neatly in a nest 
of trays. I snapped open my fold- 
ing suitcase and was reaching for 
the first bundle of green goodness 
when the glass crashed out of the 
window and the gun hammered 
bullets in my direction. 

1 WAS no longer there. If who 
ever wanted me perforated had 
fired through the glass I would 
have been thoroughly punctured 
by the lead slugs the people of this 
time favored, but he had not. His 
pausing to break the glass before 
firing had given me that fraction 
of a second to take the kind of ac- 
tion always suspicious reflexes 
are constantly waiting for. I was 
over and back in a tumbling roll, 
minibombs from my sleeve hold- 
out dropping into my fingers even 
before I hit the floor. Both flash 
and smoke. They thudded and 
flared and the air was instantly 
opaque. I sent more after the first 
and the firing stopped. I wriggled 
along the floor like a snake and, 
with the bulk of the safe between 
myself and the window, began 
stuffing the bag full of money, 
working by touch. The circum- 
stance that I was trapped and in 
mortal danger was no reason to 
leave the loot. If I was going to all 



this trouble I ought at least to be 
paid for it, I felt. 

Dragging both bags behind me I 
crawled toward the outer office 
and was about to go through the 
doorway when the loudhailer 
blared outside. 

“We know you’re in there. Come 
out and surrender or we’ll gun 
you down. The building is sur- 
rounded. You don’t have a 
chance.” 

The smoke thinned out near the 
door and, standing in the dark- 
ness, I could see through the win- 
dows that the voice had been 
speaking the truth. There were 
trucks out there, presumably 
loaded with hard-eyed and armed 
SP’s. As well as jeeps with heavy 
machine guns mounted in their 
rears. Quite a reception com- 
mittee. 

“You’ll never take me alive,” I 
shouted, sowing smoke and flare 
bombs in all directions — I even 
dropped a larger grenade that 
took out part of the rear wall. Un- 
der cover of all this excitement I 
crawled over to the sleeping chief 
and peeled off his jacket by touch. 
A lad of long service, he had more 
stripes than a tiger and hash marks 
up to his elbows. I threw my jack- 
et aside and donned his, then 
traded hats as well. The people 
outside seemed to have set an 
elaborate trap, which meant they 



THE CAST-1 RON RAT 



79 




knew more about me than I cared 
to have them know. But this knowl- 
edge could be turned against them 
by a swift change in rank. I flipped 
a few more bombs about, put my 
gun into my pocket, picked up 
both bags and unlocked and flung 
the front door open. 

“Don’t shoot — ” I called out in a 
hoarse voice as I stumbled out into 
the fresh air and stood in the open 
doorway, a perfect target. 
“Don’t shoot — he’s got a gun in my 
back. I’m a hostage — ” 

I tried to look terrified, which re- 
quired little effort when I saw the 
small army facing me. I stagger- 
ed forward a half step and looked 
over my shoulder, letting every- 
one get a good view of me while at- 
tempting to ignore the feeling 
that I had a bull’s-eye painted on 
my chest, the big black spot right 
over my heart. 

No one fired. 

I stretched the moment a bit, 
then dived off the steps. 

“Shoot. Get him! I’m clear — ” 

The result was most spectacular. 
All of the guns let go at once, blew 
the door from the frame and the 
glass from the windows. The 
whole front of the building became 
as perforated as a collander. 

“Aim high — ” I called out, 
crawling for the protection of the 
nearest jeep. “All our guys are on 
the floor.” 



^I^HEY shot high and vigorously 
^ and began to separate the top 
of the building from the bottom. I 
crept past the jeep and an officer 
came over to me and collapsed as 
I broke a sleep-gas capsule under 
his nose. 

“The lieutenant’s hit,” I cried as 
I shoved him and the bags into the 
back of the jeep. “Get him out of 
here.” 

The driver was very obliging and 
did as ordered, barely giving me 
time to get in myself Before we 
had gone five meters the gunner 
was sleeping next to the lieu- 
tenant, and as soon as the driver 
shifted into high gear he dozed as 
well. Getting him out of the seat 
and getting myself into it was 
tricky while bouncing along at a 
good clip, but I managed it. Then 
I stood on the gas pedal. 

It did not take them long to 
catch on. In fact the first of the 
jeeps was after me even as I was 
stuffing the driver in back with the 
others. This barrier of bodies was a 
blessing — because of it no more 
guns were going off. But they 
certainly were in hot pursuit. I did 
a sharp turn around a building and 
sent a platoon of boots jumping 
for cover, then took a fast look at 
the pursuers. My! Twenty, thirty 
vehicles of all kinds tore along af- 
ter me. Cars, jeeps, trucks, even a 
motorcycle or two, passing each

other, horns and sirens going, hav- 
ing a wonderful time. Jim diGriz, 
benefactor of mankind. Wherever 
I go happiness follows. I turned in- 
to a large hangar and rushed be- 
tween rows of parked helicopters. 
Mechanics dived aside in a cloud 
of flying tools as I skittered be- 
tween the machines in a tight turn 
back toward the open front. As I 
emerged on one side my followers 
were rushing in at the other. Very 
exciting. 

Helicopters — why not? This was 
Bream Field, the self-proclaimed 
helicopter capital of the world. If 
they could fix the things they could 
fly them. By now the entire naval 
station would be locked tight and 
surrounded. I had to find another 
way out. Off to one side the green 
glass form of the tower loomed up 
and 1 headed in that direction. The 
flight line was before me and a fat- 
bellied helicopter stood there, 
motor rumbling and blades 
swishing slowly. I squealed the jeep 
to a stop below the gaping door. 
When I stood up to throw my bags 
into the copter a heavy boot 
kicked out at my head. 

The people here had been alerted 
by radio, of" course — as probably 
had everyone else in a hundred- 
mile radius. It , was annoying. I 
had to duck, grab the boot and 
wrestle with its owner while my 
horde of faithful followers roared 



up behind me. The boot’s owner 
knew entirely too much about this 
kind of fighting so I cheated and 
shortened the match by shooting 
him in the leg with one of my 
needles. Then I threw the money 
into his machine, hurled some 
sleep-gas grenades after it — and 
finally myself. 

Not wanting to disturb the pilot, 
who was snoring at the controls, I 
slipped into the copilot’s seat and 
bugged my eyes at the dials and 
knobs. There were certainly 
enough of them for such a prim- 
itive device. By trial and error I 
managed to find the ones I 
wanted, but by this time I was sur- 
rounded by a solid ring of vehicles 
and a crowd of white-hatted club- 
and gun-bearing SP’s were fight- 
ing to be first into the copter. The 
sleep gas dropped them, even the 
ones wearing gas masks, and I 
waited until I had a full load, then 
pulled the throttle full on. 

T here have been better take- 
offs but, as an instructor once 
told me, anything that gets you 
airborne is satisfactory. The 
machine shuddered and shimmied 
and wallowed about. I saw men 
diving for safety below and felt the 
crunch of the landing gear against 
the top of a truck. Then we were up 
and sagging away in a slow turn. 
Toward the ocean and the south. It

was not chance alone that had led 
me to this particular military 
establishment when my funds ran 
low. Bream Field is situated in the 
lower corner of California with the 
Pacific Ocean on one side and 
Mexico on the other. Which is as 
far south and as far west as you can 
go and stay in the United States. 
I no longer wished to stay in the 
United States. Not with what 
looked like all of the navy and 
marine helicopters in the country 
rumbling up after me. I’m sure 
the fighter planes were on the way. 
But Mexico is a sovereign nation, 
a different country, and the pur- 
suit could not follow me there. 1 
hoped. At least it would pose some 
problems. And before the problems 
had been solved I would be long 
gone. 

As the white beaches and blue 
water flew by beneath me I 
worked on a simple escape plan. 
And familiarized myself with the 
controls. After a bit of trial and 
error and a few sickening lurches 
I found the automatic pilot. A 
nice device that could be set to 
hover or to follow a course. Just 
what I needed. The mere sight of it 
provided my plan, complete and 
clear. Below me the border 
rushed up, then the bull ring and 
the pink, lavender and yellow 
houses of a Mexican beach resort. 
They swept by and the grim coast- 



line of Baja California began. 
Black teeth of rocks in the foam, 
sand and sharp gorges cutting 
down to the sea, gray mesquite, 
dusty cactus. An occasional house 
or campsite. Dead ahead a rocky 
peninsula jutted out into the 
ocean and I pulled the machine up 
over it and down on the other side. 
The rest of the copters were only 
seconds behind me. 

Seconds were all I needed. I set 
the controls to hover and climbed 
down among the sleeping de- 
fenders of the law. The ocean was 
about ten meters below, the great 
spinning rotors sending up 
clouds of spray from it. I threw 
both my bags out into the water 
and had turned to inject the pilot 
in the neck even before the bags 
hit. He was stirring and blink- 
ing — the sleep-gas antidote is al- 
most instantaneous — as I set the 
robot pilot for forward flight and 
dived for the open door. 

It was a close thing. The copter 
was moving forward at full blast 
as I tumbled into the air. It 
wasn’t much of a dive but I did 
manage to get my feet down so 
they hit first. I went under, 
swallowed some water, coughed, 
swam up and banged my head on 
one of the floating bags. I con- 
gratulated myself on my fore- 
sight in having bought the new 
non-sinkable type. But the wa- 



82 



IF 




ter was far colder than I had 
thought it would be and I was shiv- 
ering and a cramp was beginning 
in my left leg. The bag gave me 
some support so that, kicking and 
floundering, I splashed over and 
grabbed the other one. As I 
secured my gains a mighty roar 
came overhead as the rumbling 
crowd of helicopters hurtled past 
like avenging angels. I’m sure that 
no one in them was looking down 
at the water — all attention 
seemed fixed upon the single cop- 
ter rushing south ahead of them. 
Even as I looked this machine be- 
gan to bob and turned in a slow 
arc. A delta-wing jet appeared 
suddenly, diving past it, coming up 
and around. I had a little time but 
not very much. And could see abso- 
lutely no place to hide on the ex- 
posed rock of the peninsula or the 
bare sand of the shore. 

Improvise, I told myself as I 
paddled and puffed toward the 
shore. They don't call you Slip- 
pery Jim for nothing. Slip out of 
this one . 

The cramp took over and all I 
felt like doing was slipping under 
the water. Then firm sand was 
under my feet and I staggered, 
gasping, up onto the beach. 

1 HAD to hide without being hid- 
den. Camouflage, one of mother 
nature’s original tricks. The an- 



gry copters were still buzzing 
about on the horizon as 1 began to 
dig furiously at the sand with my 
bare hands. 

Stop, I ordered myself and sat 
up, swaying. Use your brains not 
your muscles — lesson number 
one . 

Of course. I slipped an explosive 
grenade into my hand, triggered 
it and dropped it into the shallow 
hole, then dived aside. It 
whoomphed satisfactorily and 
sent up a spray of sand. And left a 
tidy crater that was just the right 
size for the two bags. I hurled them 
into it and began to undress fran- 
tically, throwing my clothes after 
the bags. 

The copters must have been 
chatting with each other — they 
were turning and starting back 
down the beach. Entirely by 
chance, vanity had goaded me into 
putting on purple underwear this 
morning — it could easily pass for 
swimming attire from a distance. 
I stripped down to shorts and 
kicked sand into the hole, cov- 
ering everything. 

By the time the first copter 
swished by overhead I was lying 
face down and sunning myself, 
just another swimmer on a beach. 
They swept overhead in a line. I 
sat up and looked at them as any- 
one would with all this going on. 
Then they were past — bobbing up 



THE CAST-1 RON RAT 



83 




over the rocky spine — and gone, 
motors rumbling out of hearing. 

But not for long — I heard and 
saw them again. Whoever was in 
charge had ordered a sweep in line 
abreast covering the ocean, beach 
and hills. Now they were slower, 
searching every inch of the way, 
undoubtedly with high-powered 
glasses. Time for another swim. I 
shivered when the spray curled 
around my ankles and knew I was 
turning blue as the water crept 
ever upwards. A wave broke over 
my head and then I was swim- 
ming. 

A copter came to hover over me, 
sending up clouds of spray. I 
shook my fist up at it and shouted 
realistic curses into the sound of 
its engine. Someone was leaning 
out of the open doorway, calling 
to me, but I was not listening. Af- 
ter a certain amount of fist-shak- 
ing I submerged and swam under- 
water, trying to make my one un- 
cramped leg do the work of two. 
The copter was swinging away af- 
ter the others as 1 painfully made 
my way ashore again and sprawled 
on the sand so the wind and sun 
could dry me. 

Now how did I get out of here? 

II 

A S SOON as the copters were 
out of sight I dug like a mole 



and unearthed my clothing and 
the bags, rushing them up the 
beach above the high water mark. 
Another bomb and another inter- 
ment, only this time I put on my 
trousers and shoes — and made sure 
some of my equipment went into 
the pockets. A few quick cuts 
transformed the long-sleeved uni- 
form shirt into a short-sleeved 
sport shirt. As this clothing began 
to dry it lost all resemblance to 
any part of a military dress. Be- 
fore leaving I scuffed and dragged 
the sand to obliterate all signs of 
digging and took careful triangu- 
lations of some large inland peaks 
so I could find the spot again. Then 
I headed for the coast road that 
passed a few hundred meters away. 

My luck held. I had no sooner 
climbed into the northbound lane 
when a beetlelike machine with 
high wheels came rushing towards 
me. I raised my thumb in the uni- 
versal gesture and was answered 
by a squealing of brakes. I saw now 
that powered surfboards were 
sticking out of the vehicle’s back. 
Two tanned young men sat in the 
front, their garments even more 
disarrayed then mine. A fashion, I 
knew, so perhaps they took me for 
one of their own. 

“Man, you look wet,” one com- 
mented as I climbed into the back. 

“Baby, I was high and took a 
watery trip.”

IF 




“Gotta try that some time,” the 
driver answered and the machine 
hurled itself down the road. 

Less than a minute later two 
hulking black sedans with flash- 
ing lights and howling sirens tore 
down the road in the opposite 
direction. The large letters 
POLICIA were painted on their 
side and required little linquistic 
knowledge to translate. My new 
friends, refusing the offer of 
refreshment, let me off in down- 
town Tijuana and raced away. I sat 
at an outside table with a large 
tequila, lime and salt, and realized 
that I had just escaped from a 
carefully planned trap. 

And a trap it was. That was 
obvious now that I had time to 
stop and think about it. All those 
jeeps and trucks had not appeared 
out of thin air and it is doubtful 
that amount of firepower could 
have been organized so quickly 
even if an alarm had gone off. I 
went back over my motions, step 
by step, and was absolutely sure 
that I had activated no alarms. 

So how had they known what 
was going to happen? 

They knew because some time- 
hopper had read the newspapers 
after the event then had jumped 
back in time to give the warning. I 
had been expecting this to hap- 
pen — but that did not mean I had 
to enjoy it. I licked the salt from 



the base of my thumb, downed the 
bulk of the tequila and bit hard in- 
to the lime. The combination 
tasted marvelous as it burned a 
course of acid destruction down 
my throat. 

He was alive. I had wiped out his 
organization in this happy year of 
1975 A.D. but He had gone on to 
bigger and worse nastiness in an- 
other era. The time war was on 
again. 

Now He and his madmen want- 
ed to control all history and all 
time, an insane idea that might 
very well succeed, since they had 
already wiped out the Special 
Corps in the future, the one law- 
abiding organization that might 
have beaten them. Or rather they 
had wiped out all of the Corps ex- 
cept me, while I had bounced into 
the past to wipe out the wiper-out- 
ers and in doing so restore the 
Corps to the probable paths of fu- 
ture history. Big assignment, of 
which I had accomplished ninety- 
nine point nine percent. It was the 
vital one-tenth of a percent that 
was still causing trouble — the 
monster He, who had escaped me 
at the end of a time helix even 
though he had been nicely peppered 
with exploding slugs from my gun. 
Probably had armored guts. Next 
time I would use something 
stronger. An atomic bomb on his 
breakfast tray.

T o WORK. I had hoped that a 
time helix could be built to 
whip me back to the future — rath- 
er, ahead to the future — grammar 
leaves a certain amount to be de- 
sired when it comes to traveling 
through time. Back/ahead to the 
arms of my Angelina and the ac- 
claim of my peers. But not right 
now since they did not even exist. 
Time war is tricky and can be- 
come confusing. I was glad that I 
did not need to know the theory but 
could just be whipped back and 
forth by others like a temporal 
paddle-ball to do my violent best 
at whatever the assignment 
required. 

There was little difficulty in ob- 
taining a car and digging up the 
money early the next morning, al- 
though certain plainclothes ob- 
servers had to be induced to sleep 
soundly instead of doing their 
jobs. Smuggling the money back 
into the United States was even 
easier and before noon I was in the 
offices of Whizzer Electronics, 
Incorporated, in San Diego. A 
large and complete laboratory, a 
small front office with a not too 
bright receptionist — and that was 
it. I had set the place up as best I 
could and it was up to Professor 
Coypu now to take over. 

“Do you understand. Profes- 
sor?” I asked, talking to the small 
black box with his name on it. “All 



set up and ready to go.” I shook 
the box. “Some day you must tell 
me how your memories can exist 
in this recorder if you don’t exist 
or won’t exist in this galaxy be- 
cause He and his nuts have de- 
stroyed the Corps. Better some 
day you don’t tell me. I’m not sure 
I really want to know.” 

I held the box up and gave it a 
scan around the room. 

“The finest equipment stolen 
money can afford. Every up-to- 
date research tool I could lay my 
hands on. Stocks of spare parts of 
all kinds. A supply of raw materi- 
al. Catalogs from all the electron- 
ic, physical and chemical manufac- 
turers. A large bank balance to 
draw upon to buy what you need. 
A pile of signed checks waiting to 
be filled out. Language lessons 
neatly taped. Instructions, a his- 
tory of what has happened, the 
works. Over to you. Professor, 
and take it easy with this body. It’s 
the only one we have.” 

Before I could change my mind I 
lay back on the couch, stuck the 
contact from the memory box to 
the back of my neck and turned on 
the switch. 

What\s happening? Coypu 
asked, slithering into my mind. 

“A lot. You’re in my brain, 
Coypu, so don’t do anything dan- 
gerous.” 

Most interesting. Yes, your body

indeed. Let me move that arm 
now, stop interfering. In fact why 
dont you go away for a bit while / 
see what is happening. 

“I’m not so sure that I want to.” 
Well, you must. Here, III push. 
“No!” I shouted — not that it did 
any good. A formless blackness 
pressed down on me and I spiraled 
out of sight into a greater dark- 
ness below, pushed away by 
Coypu’s electronically magnified 
memories .

so 

slowly 

T he black box was in my hand, 
the name COYPU written in 
rough white letters across its front. 
My fingers were on a switch that 
was turned to OFF. 

Memory returned and I 
staggered mentally and looked 
around for a chair so I could sit 
down. Until I discovered that 1 
was already sitting down, so I sat 
harder. 

I had been away and someone 
else had been running my body. 
Now that I was back in charge 1 
could detect faint traces of mem- 
ories of work, a lot of work, a great 
period of time, days, perhaps 
weeks. There were burns and 



callouses on my fingers and a new 
scar on the back of my right hand. 
A tape recorder rustled to life — a 
timer must have turned it on — and 
Professor Coypu spoke to me. 

“To begin with — do not do this 
again. Do not allow this recorded 
memory of my brain into control 
of your body. Because I can 
remember everything. 1 remem- 
ber that I no longer exist. This 
brain-in-a-box is all there may ever 
be of me. If I turn off the switch I 
cease to be. The switch may never 
be turned on again. Probably 
won’t. This is suicide and I am not 
the suicidal type. Impossibly hard 
to touch the switch. I think I can do 
it now. I know what is at stake. 
Something a lot bigger than the 
pseudolife of this taped brain. So I 
will do my best to turn the switch. I 
doubt I could do it a second time. 
As I said, don’t do this again. Be 
warned.” 

“I’m warned. I’m warned,” I 
muttered, turning off the tape 
while I found myself a drink. 
Coypu was a good man. The bar 
was stocked as I had left it and a 
treble malt whisky on the rocks 
cleared some of the muzziness 
from my head. I settled down and 
turned the tape on again. 

“To business. Once I began 
investigating it became obvious 
why these temporal criminals 
chose this particular epoch. This

society is just bursting into the 
age of technology, yet the people 
still have their minds in the dark 
ages. Their nationalism is sheer 
folly; their pollution, criminal; 
their intraglobal wars, madness — ” 

“Enough lecturing, Coypu, on 
with the show.” 

“ — but there is no need to lecture 
on this subject. Suffice it to say 
that all the materials for a time 
helix are available here. And the 
societal setup is such that a major 
operation of time tinkering can 
successfully be concealed. I have 
constructed a time helix and it is 
coiled and set. I have also built a 
time-tracer and with it have ascer- 
tained the temporal position of 
this creature called He. For rea- 
sons best known to him He is now 
operating out of the fairly recent 
past of this planet, some one hun- 
dred and seventy years ago. I am 
only guessing now, but I think his 
entire present operation is a trap. 
Undoubtedly for you. In some 
manner I cannot discover he has 
erected a time block before the 
year eighteen-o-five. So you can- 
not return to an early enough per- 
iod to catch him as he is building 
his present establishment. Be 
wary, he must be working with a 
large force. I have marked the con- 
trols so you can pick any of the five 
years after eighteen-o-five during 
which they are operating. In a city 



named London. The choice is 
yours. Good luck.” 

¥ FLICKED off the recorder and 
-*^went after more drink, de- 
pressed. Some choice. I could pick 
my own year to get blasted. Nip 
back into the prescientific past and 
shoot it out with the minions of 
He. Even if I won — so what? I 
would be stranded there for life, 
stuck in time. A dismal prospect. 
Yet I had to go. In reality I only 
had the illusion of choice. He was 
tracking me down in the year 1975 
and the next time he might very 
well succeed in polishing me off. 
Far better to carry the fight to 
him. Rah-rah. I took more drink 
and reached for the first book on 
the long shelf. 

Coypu had not wasted his time. 
In addition to wiring up all the 
hardware he had collected a neat 
little library about the years in 
question, the opening decade of 
the nineteenth century. London 
was my destination and I soon 
realized that the name of one man 
was of utmost importance to my 
mission. 

Napoleoni Buonaparte. Yes — 
Napoleon the First, Emperor of 
France and most of Europe and al- 
most the world. His megalo- 
maniacal ambitions rang a bell, 
for they differed hardly at all from 
He’s own ambition. There was no 



88 



IF 




coincidence here; there had to be a 
connection. 1 did not yet know 
what it was, but I was dismally 
sure that I would find out quickly 
enough. In the meantime 1 read 
through all the books on the period 
until 1 felt I knew what I had to 
know. The only bright spot in the 
whole affair was the fact that Eng- 
land spoke a variety of the same 
speech as America, so 1 would not 
have to put up with any more 
brainpuncturing language lessons 
with the memorygram. 

Of course there was the matter 
of local dress, but Coypu had 
gathered more than enough illus- 
trations of the period to show me 
what was needed. In fact a thea- 
trical outfitter in Hollywood sup- 
plied me with a complete ward- 
robe, from kneepants and but- 
toned jackets to great cloaks and 
beaver hats. The styles of the time 
were quite attractive and I took to 
them instantly, concealing a 
number of my devices in their 
voluminous folds. 

Since I would return to the same 
time in time whatever time I left 
the present time I took my time 
with the arrangements. But, 
eventually, I ran out of excuses. 
The moment had come. My wea- 
pons and tools were adjusted and 
ready, my health was perfect, my 
reflexes keen, my morale low. But 
what must be done must be done. I 



appeared in the front office and 
the receptionist gaped up at me 
chewingummily from over her 
confession magazine. 

“Miss Kipper, draw up a salary 
check for four weeks for yourself 
in lieu of notice.” 

“You don’t like my work?” 
“Your work has been all that I 
desired. But due to mismanage- 
ment this firm is now bankrupt. I 
am going abroad to dodge my 
creditors.” 

“Gee, that’s too bad.” 

“Thank you for your solicitude. 
Now if I can sign that check — ” 

We shook hands and I ushered 
her out. The rent was paid for a 
month ahead and the landlord was 
welcome to the equipment left be- 
hind. But I had fixed a destruct on 
the time helix apparatus that 
would operate after I had gone. 
There was enough tinkering with 
time as it was and I felt no desire 
to bring any more players into the 
game. 

I T WAS a labor to jam myself 
into the spacesuit with all my 
clothes on. In the end I had to take 
off both boots and jacket and strap 
these outside with the rest of my 
equipment. Heavily laden, I 
waddled over to the control board 
and braced myself for a final de- 
cision. I knew where I would ar- 
rive and, following Coypu’s 



THE CAST-1 RON RAT 



89 




instructions, had set the proper 
coordinates into the machine 
days earlier. London was out of 
the question — if He’s minions had 
any detection apparatus at all 
they would spot my arrival. I 
wanted to arrive far enough away 
geographically so they would not 
spot me, but close enough so I 
would not have to suffer a long 
journey by the primitive trans- 
portation of the time. Everything 
I had read about it caused me to 
shudder. 

So I compromised on the 
Thames Valley near Oxford. The 
bulk of the Chilterns would be be- 
tween me and London and their 
solid rock would absorb radar, 
zed rays or any other detection 
radiation. Once I had arrived I 
could make my way to London by 
water, a matter of some one hun- 
dred kilometers, rather than by the 
ghastly roads of the period. 

That was where I was ar- 
riving — when was another mat- 
ter. I stared intensely at the neatly 
numbered dials as though they 
could tell me something. They 
were mute. A time barrier had been 
set up at 1805, 1 could not arrive 
earlier. 1805 itself seemed too 
much of a trap, they would surely 
be ready, waiting and alert at that 
time. So I had to arrive later. But 
not too much later or they would 
have accomplished whatever evil 



they had in mind. Two years, 
then — not too long for them to 
work, but enough time so that they 
might — hopefully — be a little off 
guard. I took a deep breath and set 
the dials for 1807. And pressed the 
actuator. In two minutes the timer 
would cut in full power. With 
leaden feet I shuffled toward the 
glowing green coil of the time 
helix and touched the barlike end. 

As before, there was no sensa- 
tion, just the glow surrounding me 
so that the room beyond was hard 
to see. The two minutes seemed 
closer to two hours, although my 
watch told me there were more 
than fifteen seconds to go to 
springoff. This time I closed my 
eyes, remembering the uneasy 
sensations of my last time hop. I 
was tense, nervous and blind when 
the helix released and hurled me 
back through time. 

The experience was not enjoy- 
able. As the helix unwound I was 
whipped into the past while its 
energy was expended into the 
future. An interesting concept 
that did not interest me in the 
slightest. For some reason this trip 
churned up my guts more than the 
last one had and I was very occu- 
pied with convincing myself that 
whoopsing inside a spacesuit is a 
not nice thing. When I had this 
licked I realized that the falling 
sensation was caused by the fact 



90 



IF 




that I was falling — I snapped open 
my eyes to see that I was in a pelt- 
ing rainstorm. And dimly seen, 
close below, were sodden fields 
and sharp-looking trees rushing 
up at me. 

After some panicky fumbling 
with the wrist control for the grav- 
chute I managed to turn it on full 
and the harness creaked and 
groaned at the sudden deceler- 
ation. I creaked and groaned too as 
the straps felt as though they were 
slicing through my flesh to the 
bone beneath — which they would 
quickly abrade away. I honestly 
expected my arms to drop off and 
my legs to fly by when I crashed 
down through the small branches 
of a waiting tree, caromed off a 
larger branch and smacked into 
the ground below. Of course the 
grav-chute was still working on 
full lift and as soon as the grassy 
slope had broken my fall I was up 
and away again, hitting the branch 
a second lick for luck on the way 
by and springing up out of the 
treetop in a great welter of twigs 
and leaves. Once more I fumbled 
for the control and tried to do a 
better job of it. I drifted down, 
around the tree this time, dropped 
like a sodden feather onto the 
grass and lay there for a bit. 

“A wonderful landing, Jim,” I 
groaned, feeling for broken bones. 
“You ought to be in the circus.” 



I WAS battered but sound, a fact 
I realized after a painpill had 
cleared my head and numbed my 
nerve endings. I looked around 
through the lessening rain, but 
could see no one — or any sign of 
human habitation. Some cows in 
the adjoining field grazed on, 
undisturbed by my dramatic 
appearance. 

I began to unburden myself 
under the shelter of the large tree. 
The first thing off was the collaps- 
ible container I had constructed 
with great ingenuity. It opened out 
and assembled into a brassbound 
leather chest typical of the period. 
Everything else, including the 
spacesuit and grav-chute fitted 
into it. By the time I had loaded 
and locked it the rain had stopped 
and a frail sun was working hard 
to get through the clouds. The hour 
was mid-afternoon at least, I 
judged by its height. Time enough 
to reach shelter by nightfall. But 
which way? A rutted path through 
the cowfield must lead some- 
where so I took that downhill, 
climbing the drystone fence to 
reach it. The cows rolled round 
eyes in my direction but other- 
wise ignored me. They were large 
animals, familiar to me only 
through photographs, and I tried 
to remember what I had heard 
about their pugnacity. These beasts 
apparently did not remember 



THE CAST-1 RON RAT 



91 




either and did not bother me as 1 
went down the path, chest on 
shoulder, ready to face the world. 

The path led to a stile that faced 
onto a country lane. Good 
enough. I climbed over and was 
considering which direction to 
take when a rustic conveyance 
made its presence known by a great 
squeaking and a wave of airborne 
effluvium carried by the breeze. It 
clattered into sight soon after, a 
two-wheeled wooden artifact 
drawn by a singularly bony horse 
and containing a full load of what 
I have since determined to be 
manure, a natural fertilizer much 
valued for its aid to crops and its 
ability to produce one of the vital 
ingredients of gunpowder. The 
operator of this contrivance was a 
drab-looking peasant in shapeless 
clothes who rode on a platform in 
front. I stepped into the road and 
raised my hand. He tugged on a 
series of straps that guided the pull- 
ing beast and everything groaned 
to a stop. He stared down at me, 
chomping empty gums in memory 
of long-vanished teeth, then 
reached up and knuckled his fore- 
head. 1 had read about this rite, 
that represented the relationship 
of the lower class to the upper 
classes, and knew that my choice 
of costume had been correct. 

“I am going to Oxford, my good 
man,” I said. 

92 



“Ey?” he answered, cupping one 
grimy hand behind his ear. 

“Oxford!” 1 shouted. 

“Aye, Oxford,” he nodded in 
happy agreement. “It be that 
way.” He pointed back over his 
shoulder. 

“I’m going there. Will you take 
me?” 

“I be going that way.” He 
pointed down the lane. 

I took a golden sovereign out of 
my wallet, purchased from an old 
coin dealer, more money in one 
lump than he had probably seen in 
his entire lifetime, and held it up. 
His eyes opened wide and his gums 
snapped nicely. 

“I be going to Oxford.” 

T he less said about this ride the 
better. While the unsprung 
dungmobile tortured the sitting 
part of my anatomy my nose was 
assaulted by its cargo. But we were 
at least going in the correct direc- 
tion. My chauffeur cackled and 
mumbled incomprehensibly to 
himself, wild with glee at his gold- 
en windfall, urging the ancient 
nag to its tottering top speed. The 
sun broke through as we came out 
of the trees and ahead were the 
gray towers of the university, pale 
against the darker slate gray of the 
clouds, a very attractive sight in- 
deed. While I was admiring it the 
cart stopped. 



IF 




“Oxford,” the driver said, point- 
ing a grubby finger. “Magdalen 
Bridge.” 

I climbed down and rubbed my 
sore hams, looking at the gentle 
arch of the bridge across the small 
river. A thud came next to me as 
my chest hit the ground. 1 started 
to protest but my transportation 
had already wheeled about and 
was starting back down the road. 
Since I was no more desirous of 
entering the city in the cart than he 
was of taking me I didn’t protest. 
But he might at least have said 
something. Like goodbye. It 
didn’t really matter. I shouldered 
the chest and strode forward, pre- 
tending I did not see the blue-uni- 
formed soldier standing by the 
shack at the end of the bridge, 
holding a great long gunpowder 
weapon of some sort that termi- 
nated in what appeared to be a 
sharp blade. But he saw me well 
enough and lowered the device so 
it blocked my way and pushed his 
dark-bearded face close to mine. 

“Casket vooleyfoo?” he said, or 
something like that. Impossible 
to understand, a city dialect, per- 
haps, since 1 had had no trouble 
understanding the rustic who had 
brought me here. 

“Would you mind repeating 
that?” I asked in the friendliest of 
manners 

“Koshown onglay,” he growled 



and whipped the wooden lower 
end of his weapon up to catch me in 
the midriff. 

This was not very nice of him 
and I showed my distaste by step- 
ping to one side so the blow missed 
and returned the favor by plant- 
ing my knee in his midriff instead. 
He bent in the middle so I chopped 
him in the back of the neck when 
that target presented itself. Since 
he was unconscious I seized his 
weapon so it would not be actu- 
ated when it dropped. 

All of this had happened in the 
shortest of times. I was aware of 
the wide-eyed stares of the passing 
citizenry, as well as the ferocious 
glare of another soldier in the 
doorway of the ramshackle 
building. He was raising his own 
weapon toward me. This was cer- 
tainly not the way to make a quiet 
entrance into the city, but now 
that I had started this escapade, I 
had to finish it. 

With the thought the deed. I 
dived forward, which enabled me 
to put down my chest while I 
avoided the weapon at the same 
time. I heard an explosion and a 
tongue of flame shot past my head. 
Then the butt of my newly ac- 
quired weapon came up and 
caught my latest opponent under 
the chin. He went back and down 
with me right behind him. If there 
were others inside it would be best

to tackle them in the enclosed 
space. 

There certainly were other 
soldiers, a goodly number of them. 
After taking care of the nearest 
ones with a little dirty infighting 
I triggered a sleep gas grenade to 
silence the rest. I had to do 
this — but I didn’t like it. Keeping a 
wary eye on the door I quickly 
mussed the clothing and kicked the 
ribs of the men who had suc- 
cumbed to the gas in order to 
suggest that they had been felled by 
violence of some kind. 

Now how did I get out of this? 
Quickly was the best idea since the 
citizenry would have spread the 
alarm by now. Yet when I reached 
the doorway I saw that the 
passersby had drawn close and 
were trying to see what had hap- 
pened. 

When I stepped outside they 
smiled and shouted happily and 
one of them called out loudly. 

“A cheer for his lordship! Look 
what he done to the Frenchies!” 

Glad cries rang out as I stood 
there, dazed. Something was very 
wrong. Then I realized that one 
fact had been nagging at me ever 
since I had my first look at the col- 
leges. A flag was flying proudly 
from atop the nearest tower. But 
where were the crossed crosses of 
England? 

This was the tricolor of France. 



W HILE I was trying to figure 
this one out a man in plain 
brown leather clothes pushed 
through the cheering crowd and 
shouted its members into silence. 

“Get home, the lot of you, be- 
fore the frogs come and kill you 
all. And don’t say a word about 
this or you’ll be hanging from the 
town gate.” 

Looks of quick fear replaced the 
people’s elation and they began to 
move at once, all except two men 
who pushed past me to pick up the 
weapons strewn about inside. The 
sleep gas had dispersed so I let 
them pass. The first man touched 
two fingers to his cap and came up 
to me, 

“That was well done, sir, but 
you’ll have to move out quick be- 
cause someone will have heard 
that shot.” 

“Where shall I go? I’ve never 
been to Oxford before in my life.” 
He looked me up and down 
quickly, in the same way I was 
sizing him up, and came to a 
decision. 

“You’ll come with us.” 

It was a close run thing because I 
heard the tread of heavy marching 
boots on the bridge even as we 
nipped down a side lane burdened 
with the guns. But these men were 
locals and knew all the turnings

and bypaths and we were never in 
any danger that I could see. We 
ran and walked in silence for the 
better part of an hour before we 
reached a large barn that was 
apparently our destination. I fol- 
lowed the others in and put my 
chest on the floor. When I 
straightened the two men who had 
been carrying the guns took me by 
the arms, while the man in leather 
held what appeared to be an 
exceedingly sharp knife to my 
throat. 

“Who are you?” he asked. 

“My name is Brown, John 
Brown. From America. And what 
is your name?” 

“Brewster.” Then, without 
changing the level tone of his voice. 
“Can you give me reason why we 
should not kill you for the spy you 
are?” 

1 smiled calmly to show him how 
foolish the thought was. Inside I 
was not calm at all. 

Think fast, Jim, because a knife 
kills just as thoroughly as an A- 
bomb. 

What did 1 know? French 
soldiers were occupying Oxford. 
Which meant that they must have 
invaded England successfully and 
occupied all or part of it. There 
was resistance to this invasion — 
the people holding me proved that 
— so I took my clue from this fact 
and tried to improvise. 



“I am here on a secret mission.” 
Always good. The knife still 
pressed against my throat. “Amer- 
ica, as you know, sides with your 
cause — ” 

“America helps the Frenchies. 
Your Benjamin Franklin has said 
so. 

“Yes, of course, Mr. Franklin 
has a great responsibility. France 
is too strong to fight now, so we 
side with her. On the surface. But 
there are men like me who come to 
bring you aid.” 

“Prove it?” 

“How can I? Papers can be 
forged. They would be death to 
carry in any case and you wouldn’t 
believe them. But I have some- 
thing that speaks the truth. I was 
on my way to London to deliver it 
to certain people there.” 

“Who?” Had the knife moved 
away the slightest amount? 

“I will not tell you. But there are 
men like you all over England, who 
wish to throw off the tyrant’s 
yoke. We have contacted some of 
the groups and I am delivering the 
evidence I spoke of.” 

“What is it?” 

“Gold.” 

T hat stopped them. I felt the 
grip on my arms lessen. I 
pressed the advantage. 

“You have never seen me before 
and will probably never see me

again. But 1 can give you the help 
you need to buy weapons, bribe 
soldiers, help those imprisoned. 
Why do you think I assaulted those 
soldiers in public today?” 

“Tell us,” Brewster said. 

“To meet you.” I looked slowly 
around at their surprised faces. 
“There are loyal Englishmen in 
every part of this land who hate the 
invaders, who will fight to hurl 
them from these green shores. But 
how can they be contacted and 
helped? I have just shown you one 
way — and have provided you with 
these arms. I will now give you 
gold to carry on the struggle. As I 
trust you, you must trust me. If you 
wish you will have enough gold to 
slip away from here and live your 
lives out happily in some kinder 
part of the world. But I don’t think 
you will. You risked your lives for 
those weapons. You will do what 
you know is right. I will give you 
the gold and then go away. We will 
never meet again. We must act on 
trust.” 

“Sounds good to me, Brew- 
ster,” one of the men said. 

“Me, too,” said the other. “Let’s 
take the gold.” 

“I’ll take the gold if there’s any 
to be taken,” Brewster said, lower- 
ing the knife but stilf uncertain. 
“It could all be a lie.” 

“It could be,” I said quickly, be- 
fore he started punching holes in 

96 



my flimsy story. “But it isn’t — nor 
does it matter. You’ll see that I’m 
well away tonight and we will 
never meet again.” 

“The gold,” my guard said. 
“Let’s see it,” Brewster said. 

I opened the chest with utmost 
care while a gun was kept pressed 
to my kidney. I had the gold — that 
was the only part of my story that 
was true. It was divided into a 
number of small leather bags and 
intended to finance this operation 
— as it was doing now. I took out 
a bag and solemnly handed it to 
Brewster. 

He shook some of the glittering 
granules into his hand and they all 
stared. I pushed. 

“How do I get to London?” I 
asked. “By river?” 

“Sentries guard every lock of the 
Thames,” Brewster said, still 
looking at the golden gravel upon 
his palm. “You wouldn’t get as far 
as Abingdon. By horse is the only 
way, Back roads.” 

“I don’t know the back roads. 
I’ll need two horses and someone 
to guide me. I can pay — ” 

“Luke, here, will take you,” he 
said, finally looking up. “Used to 
be a drayman. But only to the 
walls. You’ll have to get past the 
Frenchies yourself.” 

“That will be fine.” So London 
was occupied. And what about the 
rest of England? 



IF 




Brewster went out to take care of 
the horses and Guy produced some 
coarse bread and cheese, as well as 
some ale which was more wel- 
come. We talked — rather, they 
talked and I listened, occasionally 
putting in a word but afraid of 
asking questions that might prove 
my almost total ignorance. But a 
picture finally developed. England 
was completely occupied and paci- 
fied, had been for some years — 
the exact number was not clear — 
although fighting was still going 
on in Scotland. There were dark 
memories of the invasion, of great 
cannon that did terrible damage. 
The Channel fleet had been 
destroyed in a single battle. I 
could detect the cloven hoof of He 
behind a lot of it. History had 
been rewritten. 

Y et this particular past was not 
the past of the future I had just 
come from. My head started to 
ache, thinking about it. Did this 
world exist in a loop of time, 
separate from the mainstream of 
history? Or was it an alternate 
world? Professor Coypu would 
know, but I did not think he would 
enjoy being plucked out of his 
memory tape again just to answer 
my questions. I would have to 
work it out without him. 

Think, Jim, put the old brain- 
box into gear. You take pride in 



what you call your intelli- 
gence — so apply it to something 
beside crookery for a change. 
There must be some form of logic 
here. Statement A: in the future 
this past did not exist. B: it sure 
exists now . 

But C might indicate that my 
presence here would destroy this 
past, even the memory of this past. 

I had no idea of how this might be 
accomplished, but it was such a 
warm and cheering thought that I 
grabbed onto it. Jim diGriz his- 
tory-changer, world-shaker. It 
made a pleasant image and I 
treasured it as I dozed off on the 
hay — and awoke not too long 
afterward scratching at insect 
life that was after my hot body. 

The horses did not arrive until 
after dark and we agreed that it 
would be best to leave at dawn. I 
managed to get some bug spray 
out of my chest to kill off my at- 
tackers so I enjoyed a relatively 
peaceful night before the ride in 
the morning. 

The ride! We were three days en 
route and before we reached Lon- 
don even my saddle sores had sad- 
dle sores. My primitive companion 
actually seemed to enjoy the trip, 
treating it as an outing of sorts, 
chatting about the country we 
passed through and getting falling, 
down drunk each evening at the 
inns where we stopped. We had

crossed the Thames above Henley 
and made a long loop to the south, 
staying away from all sizable cen- 
ters of population. When we 
reached the Thames again at 
Southwark, London Bridge was 
before us and the roofs and spires 
of London beyond. A little hard to 
see because of the high wall that 
stretched along the opposite river- 
bank. The wall had a crisp, clean 
look to it, far different from the 
smoke-stained gray of the rest of 
the city — and a sudden thought 
struck me. 

“That wall — it’s new, isn’t it?” 
“Aye, finished two years back. 
Many died there, women and chil- 
dren, everyone driven like slaves 
by Bony to put it up. Right around 
the city it goes. No reason for 
it— just that he’s mad.” 

There was a reason for it and, 
ego-flattering as it was, I still 
didn’t like it. That wall was built 
for me, to keep me out. 

“We must find a quiet inn,” I 
said. 

“The George, right down here.” 
He smacked his mouth loudly. 
“Good ale, too, the best.” 

“You enjoy it. I want some- 
thing right on the river, within 
sight of that bridge there.” 

“Know just the place — the Boar 
and Bustard on Pickle Herring 
Street, right at the foot of Vine 
Lane. Fine ale there.” 



T he foulest brew was fine with 
Luke as long as it contained 
alcohol. But the Boar and Bustard 
suited my needs perfectly. A dis- 
reputable establishment with a 
cracked signboard above the door 
depicting an improbable looking 
swine and an even more impos- 
sible looking bird squaring off at 
each other. There was a rickety 
dock to the rear where thirsty boat- 
men could tie up — and a room I 
could have that looked out on the 
river. As soon as I had arranged 
for the stabling of my horse and 
argued over the price of the room I 
bolted the door and unpacked the 
electronic telescope. This pro- 
duced a clear, large detailed, de- 
pressing picture of the city across 
the river. 

It was surrounded by that wall, 
ten meters high of solid brick and 
stone — undoubtedly bristling with 
detection apparatus of all kinds. 
If I tried to go under or over it I 
would be spotted. Forget the wall. 
The only entrance I could see from 
this vantage point was at the other 
end of London Bridge and I 
studied this carefully. Traffic 
moved slowly across the bridge be- 
cause everything and everyone 
was carefully searched before 
they were allowed to enter. French 
soldiers probed and investigated 
everything. And one by one the 
people were led through a door- 



98 



IF 




way into a building on the other 
side of the wall. As far as I could 
tell they all emerged — but would 1? 
What happened in that building? I 
had to find out and the ale room 
below was just the place. 

Everyone loves a freespender 
and 1 was all of that. The one-eyed 
landlord muttered and snaffled 
to himself and managed to find a 
drinkable bottle of claret in his 
cellar. This bottle I kept for my- 
self. The locals were more than 
happy to consume blackjack 
after blackjack of ale. These con- 
tainers were made of leather 
covered with tar, which added a 
certain novelty to the flavor, but 
the customers did not seem to 
mind. My best informant was a 
bristle-bearded drover named 
Quinch. He was one of the men 
who moved the cattle from the 
pens to the knackers’ yard, where 
he also assisted the butchers in 
their bloody tasks. His sensibil- 
ities, as one might suspect, were 
not of the highest, but his capacity 
for drink was and when he drank 
he talked and I hung from every 
word. He entered and left London 
every day and bit by bit, through 
the spate of profanity and abuse, I 
put together what I hoped was an 
accurate picture of the entrance 
procedures. 

There was a search, that much I 
could see from my window. At 



times a close search, at other times 
superficial. But there was one 
part of the routine that never 
varied. 

Every person entering the city 
had to put his arm into a hole in 
the wall of the guardhouse. That 
was all, just put it in. Not touch 
anything at all, just in up to the el- 
bow and out. 

Over this I brooded, sipping my 
wine and ignoring the roars of 
masculine cheer around me. What 
could they detect from this? Fin- 
gerprints perhaps, but I always 
wore false fingerprint covers as a 
matter of routine and had changed 
these three times since the last op- 
eration. Temperature? Skin alka- 
linity? Pulse or blood pressure? 
Could these residents of what to 
me was the dim past differ in some 
bodily composition? It was not 
unreasonable to expect some 
changes over a period of more 
than 30,000 years. I had to find out 
the present norms. 

^^HIS was done easily enough. I 
-■^constructed a detector that 
could record all of these factors 
and hung it inside my clothing. 
The pickup was disguised as a 
ring that I wore on my right hand. 
The next evening I shook hands 
with everyone I could, finished 
my wine and retired to my cham- 
ber. The recordings were precise. 



THE CAST-IRON RAT 



99 




accurate to ± 0.006% and very re- 
vealing — of the fact that my per- 
sonal readings fell well inside all 
the normal variations. 

You are not thinking, Jim, I ac- 
cused myself in the warped mir- 
ror. There has to be a reason for 
that hole in the wall. And the rea- 
son is a detection instrument of 
some kind. What does it detect? I 
turned away from the accusing 
stare. Come, come, dont evade the 
question. If you cannot answer it 
that way turn it on its head. What 
is it possible to detect? 

This was more like it. I pulled 
out a piece of paper and began to 
list all the things that can be 
observed and measured, going 
right down the frequencies. Light, 
heat, radio waves, etc., then off 
into vibration and noise, radar re- 
flections, anything and every- 
thing, not attempting to apply 
the things detected to the human 
body. Not yet. I did this after I 
had made the list as complete as 
possible. When I had covered the 
paper I shook hands with myself 
triumphantly and reread it for 
human applications. 

Nothing. I was depressed again. 
I threw it away — then grabbed it 
back. Something, what was it, 
something relating to something 
I had heard about Earth. What? 
Where. There! Destroyed by 
atomic bombs Coypu had said. 



Radioactivity. The atomic age 
was still in the future, the only ra- 
dioactivity in this world was 
natural background radiation. 
This did not take long to check. 

Me, creature of the future, 
denisen of a galaxy full of har- 
nessed radiation. My body was 
twice as radioactive as the back- 
ground count in the room, twice as 
radioactive as the hot bodies of 
my friends in the bar when 1 
slipped down to check them out. 

Now that I knew what to guard 
against I could find a way to cir- 
cumvent it. The old brain turned 
over. Soon I had a plan and well 
before dawn I was ready to at- 
tack. All of the devices secreted 
about my person were of plastic, 
undetectable by a metal detec- 
tor if they had one working. The 
items that were made of metal were 
all in a plastic tube less than a 
meter long and no thicker than my 
finger that I coiled up in one pock- 
et. In the darkest hour before the 
dawn I slipped out and stalked the 
damp streets looking for my prey. 

And found him soon enough, a 
French sentry guarding one of the 
entrances to the nearby docks. A 
quick scuffle, a bit of gas, a limp 
figure, a dark passageway. With- 
in two minutes I emerged at the 
opposite end wearing his uni- 
form his gun on my shoulder and 
carried in the correct French

IF 




manner. With my tube of devices 
down its barrel. Let them find that 
metal with a detector. My timing 
was precise and when, at the first 
light, the straggling members of 
the night guard returned to Lon- 
don, I was marching in the last 
row. I would enter, undetected, 
the ranks of the enemy. A fool- 
proof scheme. They wouldn’t 
examine their own soldiers. 

More fool I. As we marched 
through the gate at the far end of 
the bridge I saw an interesting 
thing that I could not see with my 
telescope from my window. 

As each soldier marched around 
the corner of the guardhouse he 
stopped for a moment under the 
cold eyes of a sergeant and thrust 
his arm into a hole in the wall. 

IV 

4<1\^AYERD!” I said as I 

-I' ▼ -^tripped over the uneven 
footing on the bridge. I did not 
know what it meant, but it was the 
most common word the French 
soldiers used and seemed to fit 
the occasion. With this I stum- 
bled into the soldier next to me and 
my musket caught him a pain- 
ful blow on the side of the head. 
He yelped with pain and pushed 
me away. I staggered back, hit 
my legs against the low railing and 
fell into the river. 



I managed it neatly. The current 
was swift. I sank beneath the sur- 
face and clamped the musket be- 
tween my knees so I wouldn’t lose 
it. After that I surfaced just once, 
splashing at the water and 
screaming wordlessly. The few 
soldiers on the bridge milled about, 
shouting and pointing. When I 
was sure I had made the desired 
impressioa I let my wet clothes 
and the weight of the gun pull me 
under again. The oxygen mask 
was in an inside pocket and it took 
only seconds to work it out and 
pull the strap over my head. I 
cleared the mask of water by ex- 
haling strongly and breathed in 
pure oxygen. After that it was 
just a matter of a slow easy swim 
across the river. The tide was ebb- 
ing and the current would carry 
me well downstream from the 
bridge before I landed. So I had 
escaped detection, lived to re- 
gather my forces and fight 
again — and was totally de- 
pressed by my complete failure to 
get past the wall. I swam in the 
murky twilight and tried to think 
of another plan, but it was not ex- 
actly the best place for cogita- 
tion. Nor was the water that 
warm. Thoughts of a roaring fire 
in my room and a mug of hot rum 
drove me on for what seemed an 
exceedingly long time. 

Eventually I saw a dark form in 

101 



THE CAST-1 RON RAT 




the water ahead — it resolved into 
the hull of a small ship tied up at a 
dock. I could see the pilings be- 
yond, I stopped under the keel, 
worked my tube of instruments 
out of the musket and also took 
everything out of my coat. The 
gun stuffed into the jacket sleeve 
made a good weight and both van- 
ished toward the river bottom. 
After some deep breathing I took 
off the oxygen mask and stowed 
that away as well, then surfaced as 
quietly as I could next to the ship. 

To look up at the coattails and 
patched trousers of a French 
soldier sitting on the rail above 
me. 

He was industriously polishing 
the blue-black barrel of a singu- 
larly deadly looking cannon 
that projected next to him. It was 
far more efficient looking than 
any of the nineteenth century 
weapons I had seen — in fact, it did 
not belong to this period at all. 
Out of more than casual interest I 
had made a study of weapons 
available in the era I had recent- 
ly left so I recognized this one as a 
75-millimeter recoilless cannon. 
An ideal weapon to mount on a 
light wooden ship, since it could be 
fired without jarring the vessel to 
pieces. It could also accurately 
blow any. other wooden ship out 
of the water long before the oth- 
er’s muzzle-loading cannon were 



within range. Not to mention 
destroying armies in the field. A 
few hundred of these weapons 
brought back through time could 
alter history. And they had. The 
soldier above turned and spat into 
the river — I sank beneath the sur- 
face again and vanished among 
the pilings. 

There were boat steps farther 
downriver and out of sight of the 
French ship. I surfaced there — no 
one was in sight. Dripping, cold, 
depressed, I climbed out of the 
water and hurried toward the 
dark mouth of the lane between 
the buildings. Someone was 
standing there and I scuttled 
by — then decided to stop. 

B ecause he put the muzzle of 
a great ugly pistol into my side. 
“Walk ahead of me,” he said. “I 
will take you to a comfortable 
place where you can get dry cloth- 
ing.” 

Only he did not say clothing — it 
sounded more like cloth-eeng. My 
captor had a French accent. 

All I could do was follow 
instructions, prodded on by the 
primitive hand cannon. A savage 
relic or not, it could still blow a 
nice hole in me. At the far end of 
the lane a coach had been pulled up 
to block the lane completely. The 
door gaped open in unappre- 
ciated welcome. 



102 



IF 




“Get in,” my captor said, “I am 
right behind you. I saw that un- 
fortunate soldier fall from the 
bridge and drown and I thought to 
myself, what if he had been on the 
surface? What if he were a good 
swimmer and could cross the 
river, where would he land when 
moved along by the current? A 
neat mathematical prob- 
lem — which I solved and vo/7a, 
there you were coming out of the 
water.” 

The door slammed. The coach 
started forward and we too were 
alone. I fell forward, dropped, 
turned, lunged, grabbed for the 
pistol — and seized it by the butt be- 
cause my captor now had it by the 
barrel and was holding it out to 
me. 

“By all means, you hold the gun, 
Mr. Brown, if it pleases you, it is 
no longer needed.” He smiled as I 
gaped, scowled and leveled the 
pistol at him. “It seemed the sim- 
plest way to convince you to join 
me in the carriage. 1 have been 
watching you for some days now 
and am convinced that you do not 
like the French invaders.” 

“But — you are French?” 

“But of course. A follower of the 
late king, a refugee now from the 
land of my birth. I learned to hate 
this pipsqueak Corsican while 
people here were still laughing at 
him. But no one laughs any longer 



and we are united in one causo. 
But, please, let me introduce my- 
self. The Count d’Hesion — but you 
may call me Charles, since titles 
are now a thing of the past.” 

“Pleased to meet you, Charley.” 
We shook on it. “Just call me 
John.” 

The coach clattered and groaned 
to a stop before this interesting 
conversation could be carried 
any further. We were in the court- 
yard of a large house and, still car- 
rying the pistol, I followed the 
count inside. I was still suspi- 
cious but there seemed little to be 
suspicious of. The servants were 
all ancient and tottered about 
muttering French to each other. 
Knees creaking, one aged retain- 
er poured a bath for me and helped 
me to strip, completely ignoring 
the fact that I still held the pistol 
while he soaped my back. Warm 
clothes were provided, and good 
boots, and when I was alone I 
transferred my armory and de- 
vices to my new clothing. The 
count was waiting in the library 
when I came down — he was sip- 
ping from a crystal glass filled 
with interesting drink. A brim- 
ming container of the same stood 
close beside him. I handed him the 
pistol and he handed me a glass of 
the beverage in return. It glided 
down my throat like warm music 
and sent a cloud of delicate vapor

into my nostrils the like of which I 
had never inhaled before. 

“Forty years old, from my own 
estate, which as you can tell in- 
stantly is in Cognac.” 

¥ SIPPED again and looked at 
^ him. Nobody’s fool. Tall and 
thin with graying hair, a wide fore- 
head, lean, almost ascetic fea- 
tures. 

“Why did you bring me here?” I 
asked. 

“So we could join forces. I am a 
student of natural philosophy 
and I see much that is unnatural. 
The armies of Napoleon have 
weapons that were made nowhere 
in Europe. Some say they come 
from far Cathay, but I think not. 
These weapons are served by men 
who speak very bad French, 
strange and evil men. There is talk 
of even stranger and more evil 
men at the Corsican’s elbow. 
Unusual things are happening 
in this world. I have been watching 
for other unusual things and am 
on the lookout for strangers. 
Strangers who are not English, 
such as yourself. Tell me — how 
can a man swim across a river un- 
der water?” 

“By using a machine.” 

There was no point in 
silence — the count knew very well 
what he was asking. With those 
dark cannon out there there was 



no point in maintaining secrecy 
about the nature of the enemy. His 
eyes had widened at my reply but 
he took time to finish his drink. 

“I thought so. A machine 
unknown here — save to you. And I 
think you know more about these 
strange men and their weapons. 
They are not of the world as we 
know it, are they? You have know- 
ledge of them and you are here to 
fight them?” 

“They are from a place of evil 
and madness and they have 
brought their crimes with them. 
And I am fighting them. I cannot 
tell you everything about them be- 
cause I don’t know the entire story 
myself. But I am here to destroy 
them and everything they have 
done.” 

“I was sure of it. We must join 
forces and I will give you whatever 
help I can.” 

“You can begin by teaching me 
French. I have to get into London 
and it appears that I will need to 
speak it.” 

“But is there time?” 

“An hour or two will do. 
Another machine.” 

“I am beginning to understand. 
But I am not sure that I like all 
these machines.” 

“Machines cannot be liked or 
disliked — they are immune to 
emotion. We can use them or mis- 
use them, so the problem of ma- 



104 



IF 




chines is a human problem, too. 

“I bow to your wisdom — you 
are, of course, right. When do we 
begin?” 

I returned to the Boar and 
Bustard for my things, then moved 
into a room in the count’s house. A 
head-splitting evening with the 
memorygram — headache is a 
mild word for the side effects of 
using this memory-cramming 
machine — taught me conversa- 
tional French and, to the count’s 
pleasure, we conversed in that 
language. 

“And the next step?” he asked. 

“I need to take a closer look at 
one of those pseudo-Frenchmen 
who seem to be running things. Do 
they ever appear alone on this side 
of the river — or if not alone, in 
small groups?” 

“They do, but their movements 
follow no set pattern. Therefore I 
shall obtain the most recent in- 
formation.” He rang the silver 
bell that stood next to the de- 
canter. “Would you like one of 
these individuals rendered un- 
conscious or dead and brought to 
you?” 

“You are too kind,” I said, 
holding out my glass so that the 
servant who had appeared sound- 
^lessly could refill it. “I’ll handle 
that end of the business myself. 
Just point him out and I’ll take 
over from there.” 



T he count issued instructions. 

The servant slipped away. I 
worked on my drink. 

“It will not take long,” the count 
said. “And when you have the in- 
formation — do you have a plan of 
action?” 

“Roughly. I must enter London. 
Find He, the top demon in this 
particular corner of hell, then 
kill him, I imagine. And demolish 
certain machinery.” 

“The upstart Corsican — you will 
remove him, too?” 

“Only if he gets in the way. I am 
no common murderer and find it 
difficult to kill at any time. But 
my actions should change the en- 
tire operation. The new weapons 
will no longer be supplied and will 
soon run out of ammunition. In 
fact — the interlopers may vanish 
altogether.” 

The count raised one eyebrow 
but was kind enough not to com- 
ment. 

“The situation is complex, in 
fact I do not really understand it 
myself. It has to do with the na- 
ture of time, about which I know 
very little. But it seems that this 
past, the time we are living in now, 
does not exist in the future. The 
history books to come tell us that 
Napoleon was beaten, his empire 
wiped out, that Britain was never 
invaded.” 

“It should only be!”

“It may be — if I can get to He. 
But if history is changed again, 
brought back to what it should 
have been, this entire world as we 
know it now, may vanish.” 

“A certain risk must be taken in 
all hazardous enterprises.” The 
count remained cool and com- 
posed, moving one hand in a slight 
gesture of dismissal as he talked. 
An admirable man. “If this world 
disappears it must mean that a 
happier one will come into exist- 
ence?” 

“That’s roughly it.” 

“Then we must press on. In that 
better world some other I will be 
returning to my estates. My fami- 
ly will live again. There will be 
flowers in the spring and happi- 
ness in the land. Giving up this life 
here will mean little — it is a miser- 
able existence. Though I would 
prefer that knowledge of this pos- 
sibility stay locked in this room. I 
am not sure that all of our assis- 
tants will accept such a philo- 
sophical viewpoint.” 

“I agree heartily. I wish it could 
be some other way.” 

‘Do not concern yourself, my 
dear friend. We will talk of it no 
longer.” 

W E DIDN’T. We discussed art 
and viniculture and the haz- 
ards inherent in the manufacture 
of distilled beverages. Time 



moved quickly — as did the count’s 
men — and even before we started 
on a second decanter he was 
called out to receive a report. 

“Admirable,” he said upon his 
return, rubbing his hands togeth- 
er with pleasure. “A small party of 
the men we seek are even now dis- 
porting themselves in a knocking 
shop in Mermaid Court. There are 
guards about, but I presume they 
offer no barrier to your oper- 
ation?” 

“None,” I said, rising. “If you 
will be kind enough to provide 
some transportation and a guide 
I promise to return within the 
hour.” 

This was done and I performed 
as promised. A morose individu- 
al with a shaven head and badly 
scarred face took me in the car- 
riage and pointed out the correct 
establishment. I entered the 
building next to it, an office of 
some kind, now shuttered and 
locked with a monstrous piece of 
hardware most difficult to open. 
Not that the lock mechanisms 
were beyond me — never! — but 
they were so big that my lockpick 
couldn’t reach the tumblers. My 
knife did, though, and I went 
through and up to the roof and 
crossed over to the roof of the next 
' building, where I attached the end 
of my spiderweb to the most solid 
of the collection of chimneys.

IF 




The strand of the web was fine, al- 
most invisible and practically 
unbreakable, made up of a single 
long-chain molecule. It ran slow- 
ly off the reel that was fastened by 
a harness to my chest and I 
dropped toward the dark win- 
dows below. Dark to others. But 
the dual beams of ultraviolet light 
from the projectors on my UV 
sensitive goggles turned all light 
to day for me wherever I looked. 
I entered the window silently, 
caught my man with his pants 
down, rendered him and his com- 
panion unconscious with a dose 
of gas and had him dozing in my 
arms and back up to the roof as 
quickly as the fiercely whirring spi- 
derweb reel could lift us. 

Minutes later my prize was snor- 
ing on a table in the count’s cellar, 
while I spread out my equipment. 
The count looked on with inter- 
est. 

“You wish to obtain informa- 
tion from this species of pig? I do 
not normally condone torture but 
this seems to be an occasion for 
hot pokers and sharp blades. The 
crimes these creatures have com- 
mitted! It is said the New World 
aborigines can flay a person com- 
pletely without killing him.” 

“Sounds jolly, but there will be 
no need.” I lined up the instru- 
ments and hooked up the contacts. 
“Machines again. I shall keep him 



unconscious and walk through his 
mind with spiked boots, even a 
worse torture in many ways. He 
will tell us what we need to know 
without ever knowing he has 
spoken. Afterward he is yours, you 
see. 

“Thank you, no.” The count 
raised disgusted hands. “When- 
ever one of them is killed the 
civilians suffer from reprisals. We 
will knock this one about a bit, rob 
him and dump him in an alley. Our 
treatment of him will resemble a 
simple crime.” 

“The best idea yet. Now I be- 
gin.” 

Going through that mind was 
like swimming in a sewer. Insani- 
ty is one thing — and he was certi- 
fiably insane — but outright evil is 
inexcusable. I had no problem ex- 
tracting information, just in sort- 
ing it out. He wanted to speak his 
own language but finally settled 
for French and English. I plumbed, 
picked and probed and eventually 
discovered all I needed to know. 
Jules, my companion of the shaved 
head, was called in for the pleasur- 
able sport of roughing up the sub- 
ject and dumping him — stripped of 
his uniform — while the count and 1 
returned gratefully to the unfin- 
ished carafe. 

“Their headquarters appears to 
be in a place called St. Paul’s. 
You know of it!”

“Sacrilege — they halt at noth- 
ing. The cathedral, the master- 
piece of the great Sir Christopher 
Wren, it is here on the map.” 

“The one named He is there — 
and apparently all the machinery 
and instruments as well. But to 
reach it I must enter London. 
There is a good possibility that I 
might be able to pass the wall in 
his uniform since his body has the 
same radioactivity count as mine, 
a test they use to detect strangers. 
But there may be passwords, other 
means of identification, perhaps 
speaking in their own language. 
What is needed is a diversion. Do 
you have anyone with a knowledge 
of gunnery among your follow- 
ers?” 

“Certainly. Rene Dupont is a 
former major of artillery, a most 
knowledgeable soldier. And he is 
in London.” 

“Just the man. I am sure he will 
enjoy operating one of those 
high-powered guns. We shall cap- 
ture a gunship before dawn. The 
bombardment will start at first 
light when the gates are opened. A 
certain number of shells through 
the gate, guardhouse and guard 
should be disconcerting. Then 
the boat will be abandoned and the 
gunners will escape on foot. This 
will be the responsibility of your 
men.” 

“It will be a pleasurable task 



that I shall personally supervise. 
But where will you be?” 
“Marching into the city with 
the troops, as I tried to do once be- 
fore.” 

“Most hazardous! If you are too 
early you will be apprehended as 
you appear — or perhaps de- 
stroyed in the bombardment. Too 
late and the gate will be sealed 
against entry.” 

“So we’ll have to time the oper- 
ation accurately.” 

“I will send for the finest chron- 
ometers obtainable.” 



V 

AJOR DUPONT was a red- 
faced and gray-haired man 
with an impressive rotundity of 
belly. But he was energetic enough 
and knew his gunnery and was now 
consumed with a fierce passion to 
operate the invaders’ incredi- 
ble weapon. The former crew of 
the gunboat, including the look- 
outs, slept a deeper sleep than they 
had planned below decks while I 
worked out the mechanism of the 
recoilless cannon and explained 
it to the major. He grasped it in- 
stantly and beamed with fierce 
joy. After his experience with ir- 
regular cannon barrels, muzzle- 
loaded, uneven shot, slow-burn- 
ing powder and all the rest of the

handicaps of his trade this wea- 
pon was a revelation to him. 

“Charge, fuse, and projectile in 
the same casing — marvelous! And 
this lever swings open the breach?” 
he asked. 

“Correct. Keep away from these 
vents when firing — the exhausted 
gas from the explosion comes out 
here, canceling the recoil. Use 
the open sights — the range is short. 
I imagine there will be no need to 
allow for windage at this dis- 
tance and there will also be scarce- 
ly any projectile drop. The muz- 
zle velocity is much greater than 
you are used to.” 

“Tell me more,” he said, strok- 
ing the smooth steel. 

Step two. The count would see 
to it that the ship was moved up- 
stream before dawn and anchored 
to the embankment below Lon- 
don Bridge. I would see to it that 1 
arrived on the bridge at the agreed 
time. The count’s nautical chro- 
nometer was as big as a cabbage, 
handmade of brass and steel, and 
it clacked loudly. But he assured 
me of its accuracy and we set it 
from my atomic watch, as big as 
my fingernail and accurate to 
within one second a year. This 
was the last thing to be done and as 
I rose to leave he put out his hand 
and I took it. 

“We will always be thankful for 
your aid,” he said. “There is new 



hope now among the men and I 
share their enthusiasm.” 

“It is I who should be thanking 
you for the help. Considering the 
fact that my winning might be the 
worst thing for you.” 

He dismissed that thought as un- 
important — a brave man. 

“In dying we win as you have ex- 
plained. A world without these 
swine is victory enough. Even if we 
are not there to witness it. Do your 
duty.” 

I did. Trying to forget that the 
fate of worlds, civilization, whole 
peoples rested upon my actions. 
A slip, an accident, and it would 
be all over for everyone. There 
could therefore be no accidents. 
As mountain climbers do not 
look down and think about the 
drop below, I put thoughts of fail- 
ure from my mind and tried to 
think of a joke to cheer myself up. 
None came to mind instantly so I 
thought instead about putting paid 
to He and his operation and this 
was cheering indeed. I looked at 
my watch. It was time to leave so I 
went quickly, without looking 
back. The streets were deserted; 
all honest men were home in bed. 
Behind me the first gray of ap- 
proaching dawn touched the sky.

lurking. I lurked craftily within 
sight of London Bridge and 
watched as the first soldiers ap- 
peared. Some marched in step, 
some straggled, all looked tired. I 
was feeling tired myself so I 
sucked on a stimtab and kept an 
eye on my watch. Ideally 1 should 
be oh the bridge when the firing 
began, far enough from the gate 
not to be hit, yet close enough to 
get through it during the excite- 
ment after the barrage. From my 
vantage point I timed various 
groups of soldiers crossing the 
bridge until I had a good esti- 
mate. The digits rolled by on my 
watch and at the proper moment I 
took a military brace with my 
shoulders and stepped out smart- 

ly- 

^'Lortytort?'' a voice called 
out — and I realized it was calling 
to me. I had been so concerned 
with the time I had stupidly ig- 
nored the fact that He’s future- 
fiends would be crossing the 
bridge as well. 

I waved, made an evil grimace 
and stepped out smartly. The man 
who had called out looked puzzled 
—then hurried after me. By my 
uniform he knew I was one of his 
gang, but one unfamiliar to him. 
He probably wanted to ask me 
how things were back in the home 
asylum. I wanted no conversation 
with him, particularly since I 



didn’t speak his language. I hur- 
ried on — painfully aware of his 
footsteps behind me. Then I real- 
ized I was going too fast and at 
my present pace would reach the 
gate just in time to be blown up. 

There was no time to curse my 
lack of awareness — my problem 
was just a matter of picking what 
kind of trouble I wanted. Getting 
myself blown up was a little too 
much to get involved with now. I 
could see that the gunboat was in 
position and that figures were on 
deck. Wonderful. I could already 
almost hear the explosions. With 
me in the middle of them. I would 
have to stop here — at the ap- 
pointed spot. I did. Heavy foot- 
steps hammered up behind me 
and a hand caught at my shoulder, 
spinning me about. 

“Lorr//y/7M?” he cried out. Then 
the expression on his face 
changed, his eyes widening, his 
mouth opening. “B//V/7! he 
shouted. He recognized me, per- 
haps from photographs.

shot him in the neck with the nar- 
cotic needle gun I had palmed. 
Another cry of came and 

one of his teammates pushed 
through the soldiers and I had to 
shoot him, too. This naturally in- 
terested everyone nearby. I 
heard startled shouts and saw a 
certain amount of weapon lift-

ing. I put my back to the bridge 
parapet and wondered if I would 
have to shoot the entire French 
army. 

I did not. The first shell, not too 
well aimed by the major of horse 
artillery, hit the bridge not ten 
meters from where I was standing. 

The explosion was considerable 
and the air was filled with hurtling 
pieces of masonry and steel. I 
dropped — as did all the others, 
some permanently — and I took 
the opportunity to put needles 
into all the nearest soldiers who 
had witnessed my earlier shoot- 
out. 

Back on the boat Dupont was 
learning to master his weapon 
and the next shell struck the city 
wall. There was much shouting 
and running about among the men 
on the bridge and I ^shouted and 
milled with the best of them, look- 
ing on with pleasure as the next 
shell whistled cleanly through the 
gate and blew up the guardhouse 
inside. Now most of the motion 
was away from the gate, as well it 
should be, so I dropped and 
wormed my way closer on my 
belly. Shells were now bursting in 
and around the gate and causing a 
satisfying amount of destruc- 
tion. A quick look at my watch in- 
formed me that it was almost time 
for the barrage to lift. The signal 
would be a shell hitting the wall 



far from the bridge. After this a 
few more shots would be fired for 
effect at targets of opportuni- 
ty — but no more at the gate. 

The shell struck the wall a good 
hundred meters downriver, blow- 
ing a neat hole in it. I jumped to my 
feet and ran. 

W HAT a fine destructive mess. 

Wreckage and crumbled ma- 
sonry were everywhere. Dust and 
the reek of high explosive hung in 
the air. If any survivors of the 
bombardment were left they had 
long since vanished. I scrambled 
over the rubble, slid down the oth- 
er side and nipped around the first 
corner. The only witnesses to this 
unstealthy entrance was a couple 
watching from a doorway, 
English by their dress, who turned 
and ran as soon as they saw me. 
Despite my little tangle on the 
bridge the plan had worked per- 
fectly. 

The cannon on the river began 
firing again. 

This was not part of any plan, 
not at all. Something had gone 
wrong. After the last shots my ac- 
complices were to have retreated 
to shore and removed themselves 
to safety. Then two explosions 
sounded, almost at the same time. 
The cannon could not fire that 
fast. 

Another gun was shooting.

IF 




The street I was on, Upper 
Thames Street, ran parallel to the 
wall. I was far enough from the 
bridge now for my presence not be 
associated with the action 
there — and a ladder led up to an 
observation platform on the top 
of the wall. Perhaps prudence 
should have dictated a single- 
minded continuation of my plans. 
But I have spent many years not 
listening to that particular voice 
and I was not prepared to start 
now. One quick look around — no 
one in sight — and up the ladder. 
The observation post was unoc- 
cupied. From it I had a perfect 
view of the action. 

The major was still manning his 
gun, busily firing away at anoth- 
er gunboat that was coming up- 
river under full sail. The new- 
comer, even though handicapped 
by a moving platform, was more 
experienced and accurate with 
his weapon. A shell had already 
blown a great hole in the stern of 
my ally’s boat and even as I 
watched another hit amidships 
and the gun was silent, its barrel 
in the air and the gunner gone. A 
figure ran across the dock and 
dropped into the crippled ship. I 
dug out my electronic telescope 
and trained it on the deck, know- 
ing what I would see even before I 
put it to my eye. 

The count had come to the aid of 



his troops. But even as he jumped 
aboard, the major rose, blood run- 
ning down his face, and manned 
the gun again. It swung about, aim- 
ing at the other boat, and hit it 
squarely with the next shot right at 
the waterline below the enemy 
weapon. 

The second gun was 
silenced — the ship was sinking. 
When I looked back at the major 
again I saw that he had retrained 
his cannon and was firing at the 
bridge, at the enemy soldiers there. 
The count was loading for him. 
They both were smiling and 
seemed to be enjoying them- 
selves. The firing continued, fast- 
er now, and I let myself back 
down the ladder. 

Neither of them could be 
blamed — they knew exactly what 
they were doing. They were firing 
back at last at the enemy they had 
hated all these years, using a su- 
perior and highly destructive 
weapon. Both would stay there in 
action until they were cut 
down. Perhaps they wanted it that 
way. If this sacrifice were to have 
any value at all I had to get on with 
my own job. 

I had studied the count’s map. 
My immediate course lay along 
Duck’s Foot Land to Cannon 
Street and then left. People were 
about now, frightened civilians 
hurrying by, soldiers marching

on the double in the opposite di> 
rection. No one paid any atten- 
tion to me at all. 

And there, up ahead at the end 
of the street, the great bulk of the 
walls and dome rose — unmistak- 
ably St. Paul’s. 

The end of another road was 
near. My final meeting with He. 

VI 

1 WAS scared. A man is either a 
liar — or mad — who claims nev- 
er to have felt fear. I have been 
touched by it often enough to rec- 
ognize its smell, but never have I 
felt the iron hand clamping down 
as it did now. Ice water in the veins, 
a hammering in the heart, a 
rooted feeling in the feet. With a 
decided effort I grabbed my brain 
by the throat, no mean feat that, 
and gave it a good shaking. 

Speak, brain, I commanded. 
Why this sudden case of acute 
chickenitis? Why the yellow 
stripe right down the back as far as 
the heels? Body and brain, we have 
been in tight spots before, even 
narrower ones. But we bulled 
through and came out on the other 
side. Usually victors. What is new 
here? 

The answer came back quickly. 
As a rustproof rodent I had pene- 
trated behind the walls of soci- 
ety, doing it on my own and stand- 



ing or falling on my own. Adven- 
ture, rah-rah. But now too much 
was riding on the bet — too many 
people’s lives depended upon my 
actions. The future survival of 
the entire galaxy might be at 
stake. It was almost unbeliev- 
able. 

“Make it unbelievable,” I mut- 
tered, digging in my medikit. If I 
kept dwelling on what was at stake 
I would take no risks, probably 
take no action. 1 have never re- 
sorted to artificial morale be- 
fore, but there is a first time for 
everything. I carried berserker 
pills as a sort of amulet — I knew 
they were there if I ever needed 
them, therefore I had never 
needed them. Until now. I clicked 
open the case and brushed the dust 
off an innocent looking capsule. 

“Get out there and fight, Jim,” I 
said and swallowed the thing. 

They are outlawed everywhere 
and for good reasons. Not be- 
cause they are habit forming to a 
great degree, both physically and 
psychologically, but for social 
reasons. Inside the gelatin cap- 
sule lies a specific form of mad- 
ness, a compound that dissolves 
the conscience and morality of 
civilized man. Superld takes over. 
No morals, conscience — or fear — 
survive it. Nothing remains but a 
great chunk of ego and the sure 
knowledge of might and right, di-

vine permission to do anything and 
not to feel concern or fear while 
doing it. Politicians loaded on 
berserkerite have toppled regimes 
and controlled worlds. Athletes 
have broken all sports records, of- 
ten destroying themselves or their 
opponents in the process. Not nice 
stuff. 

Very nice stuff. I had one fleet- 
ing instant of conscience and. real- 
ization of change as the chemicals 
took hold of my brain, but it passed 
even as it began. “I have come for 
you. He,” I said, smiling with gen- 
uine joy. 

This was power unlimited, the 
most exhilarating sensation I 
had ever experienced, a cleans- 
ing wind blowing out all the dusty 
corners of my brain. Do what you 
want Jim, what you will because 
you are the only* power in the 
world that really counts. How 
blind I had lived for years. 
Cramped by small moralities, 
puny affections for others, de- 
structive other-orientated love. 
How crippled I had been. 

I love myself because I am God, 

At last I understood the mean- 
ing of God that the old religions 
were always mumbling about.

A STROLL around the prem- 
ises. A solid enough structure, 
no apparent guards, undoubted- 
ly loaded with detection appara- 
tus. A subtle or secret approach 
would not be wise. The only ad- 
vantage I could have was sur- 
prise, that and the ability to be ab- 
solutely ruthless. I was well 
armed, a walking engine of death, 
and no one would stop me. Entry 
would be simple enough, others 
were going in and out constantly, 
all in the same uniform I was 
wearing. I sensed a buzz and a dis- 
turbed whine to this beehive at the 
present. They did not like the at- 
tack on the gate. I had to strike 
now while they were disturbed. All 
devices at the ready and instantly 
available I completed my lei~ 
surely circuit of the building and 
started up the white stone steps at 
its front. 

The cathedral was immense, ap- 
pearing even larger with all the 
pews and religious furniture 
cleared away. I stalked down the 
length of the long nave as though I 
owned it, weapons ready. The nave 
was deserted and all the activity 
was concentrated at the far end in 
the apse where the altar usually 
stood. In its place loomed an or- 
nate throne.

He sat on it. Arrogant with pow- 
er, great red body leaning for- 
ward to issue orders to his assis- 
tants below. A long table reached 
across the transept, littered with 
maps and papers and surrounded 
by brilliantly uniformed offi- 
cers. They seemed to be taking 
their orders from a man in a sim- 
ple blue uniform coat. He was 
short and wore a black lick of hair 
across his forehead. From de- 
scriptions I recognized Na- 
poleon — passing on instructions 
from He as I had expected. I knew 
I was smiling as I shifted my fin- 
ger tips closer to my armament. 

A familiar crackling of light 
caught my attention from the sec- 
ondary apse off to the right and my 
smile broadened. The gleaming 
machinery of a time helix was 
stuffed in there, surrounded by 
technicians bent over their tasks. 
They would be dead soon, like 
everyone else here. And I would 
have temporal transportation 
out of this barbarian era. I would 
have to leave a small atomic 
grenade behind me when I left. 
The end was just in sight. 

No one paid the slightest atten- 
tion to me as I came up to the ta- 
ble. I would have to use sleep gas 
first since this would work on them 
all at the same time. Plenty of time 
to kill the slaves after I had re- 
moved their master. 



One concussion grenade, two 
thermite grenades. I triggered 
them with my thumb and threw 
them, one — two — three, in high 
arcs into He’s lap. While they were 
still in the air I rolled handful af- 
ter handful of gas grenades down 
the table under the shocked faces 
of the officers. The grenades were 
still hissing and banging as I spun 
about and used my needle gun — I 
didn’t want to injure the con- 
trols — to shoot down the techni- 
cians around the time helix. 

It was all over in a matter of sec- 
onds. Quiet descended as the last 
man fell. Before turning back I 
hurled grenades down the length of 
the nave so that anyone entering 
would walk into the gas cloud. 
Then I looked at He. 

Lovely. A roaring pillar of fire 
with something in its core that 
might have been a man. The throne 
burned as well and the column of 
greasy smoke roiled up towards 
the great dome above. 

“You are beaten — ” I shouted 
leaning forward across the table 
to get a better look. He would not 
be surviving this attack. 

Napoleon lifted his head from 
the table and sat up. 

“Don’t be foolish,” he said. 

I wasted no time in thought but 
tried to kill him. But he was ready 
and fired before I did with a tube- 
like weapon concealed in his

palm. Fire washed across my face, 
then it was numb. My body went 
lifeless, died, though I could hear 
and see. I dropped face down onto 
the table. I could not feel Na- 
poleon’s hands when he rolled me 
over but I could see him looking 
down at me, smiling. I could hear 
him roaring with victorious 
laughter that held more than an 
echo of madness. 

Some comprehension must 
have reached my eyes. 

“That is right,” he shouted. “I 
am He. You have lost. You have 
burned, destroyed that fine 
organic mechanism whose only 
function was to deceive you. It 
was a trap for you, everything 
here, even the existence of this 
world, this loop in time, has no 
function other than trapping 
you. Did you forget so quickly 
that a body is merely a shell for 
me, the eternal He? My brain has 
mastered death and lives on. Now 
in this imitation of a mad em- 
peror. He never knew what real 
madness was. But you have 
lost—” 

T his was a temporary setback. 

I suppose that normally I 
would have felt defeated, afraid, 
angry, suffered under some kind 
of useless emotion. Now I sim- 
ply waited for the opportunity to 
kill He again. My berserker con- 



dition found the lack of results 
boring — after two tries He was 
still alive. I resolved that the third 
would be the final one. 

He bent and searched me with 
brutal thoroughness, ripping my 
clothing into shreds, pulling off 
devices that adhered to my skin, 
taking the knife from my ankle, 
the gun from my wrist, the tiny 
grenades from my hair. Within 
seconds every ready weapon I had 
was gone. The few devices left 
were well out of reach. The search 
over he discarded me, flinging my 
limp body face upward onto the 
table. 

“I have prepared for this mo- 
ment.” He told me. 

I heard the rattle of chains as he 
picked up my wrists and snapped 
heavy metal fetters about them. 
As the cuffs closed there was a 
brief flash of light as the ends 
welded together and I saw the in- 
stant blistered redness of my skin 
where it touched the metal. Not 
important — I felt ntothing. 

He pushed a needle into my 
wrist. 

Feeling began to return, first to 
my hands — great pain in the 
wrists — and then to my arms. A lot 
of pain seemed to be associated 
with the return of sensation. I ig- 
nored it, although spasms shook 
my body uncontrollably. In the 
end I shook myself off the table. 



THE CAST-IRON RAT

falling heavily to the floor. He 
bent and picked me up at once, 
dragging me across the width of 
the great cathedral. His strength, 
even in the disguise of this small 
body, was tremendous. 

In the brief instant I had lain on 
the floor I had grabbed something 
with my fingers. I did not know 
what it was — it felt quite small 
and metallic — but it remained 
clenched tightly in my fist. 

A solid waist-high metal pillar 
stood about five meters from the 
time-helix controls. This, too, was 
waiting for me. He held my wrists 
apart and laid the chain that joined 
them into a groove in the top of 
the pillar. Another flash of light 
welded the chain to the solid metal. 
He released me and I swayed but 
did not fall. Sensation and con- 
trol were returning to my body 
and I mastered it as he went to the 
controls and made some adjust- 
ments. 

The vast cathedral was silent. 
We were alone except for the hud- 
dled bodies. 

“I have won,” he yelled sudden- 
ly, doing a litte dance step. He 
pointed to the coiled form of the 
time helix and laughed out loud. 
“Do you realize that you are now 
in a loop of time that does not ex- 
ist, that I called into being to trap 
you, that will vanish as soon as I 
leave it?” 



“I suspected that. Napoleon lost 
in our text books.” 

“He won here. I gave him the 
weapons to conquer the world. 
Then I killed him when my new 
body was ready, This loop in time 
came into being when he died and 
its existence created a barrier in 
time that will go down as soon as it 
ceases to exist. When I leave this 
will happen, but not instantly, 
that would be too easy for you. I 
want to think of you here — alone, 
knowing that you have lost and 
that your future will never exist. 
There is a time fixator on this 
building. It will be here after Lon- 
don and the entire world are gone, 
perhaps longer than you. You 
may die a difficult death— or live 
an even more difficult life — be- 
fore it shuts off. I have won.” 

He turned to the controls again. 
I opened my fist to see what wea- 
pon I had in my palm that might 
defeat him at this final moment. 
It was a small brass cylinder that 
weighed no more than a few grams. 
One end had small holes punched 
in it and when I turned it over fine 
white sand came out. A sander, 
used for drying the writing ink on 
papers. 1 might have wished for a 
better weapon but this would 
have to do. 

“I leave,” He said, actuating the 
mechanism. 

“What about your men here?”

IF 




“Mad slaves. They vanish with 
you, having served my purpose. I 
have an entire world of them wait- 
ing to welcome my return. Soon 
there will be many worlds — soon 
they will all be mine.” 

I could add nothing much to 
that. He sauntered across the flag- 
stones, a monster in the body of 
that tiny man, touched his hand to 
the glowing end of the time helix 
and was instantly engulfed by its 
cold green flame. 

“All mine,” he said. 

“I don’t think so.” 

I JUGGLED the sander in my 
hand, testing its weight, mea- 
suring the distance to the con- 
trols. My chains permitted some 
movement. The settings for the 
time scale of the helix were a bank 



of keys — a number of them were 
depressed now. If 1 could push one 
more of them down the setting 
would be changed and He would 
arrive at an unscheduled time 
and place — perhaps not arrive at 
all. I swung my hand as much as 
my fetters permitted, estimat- 
ing the distance, the trajectory 
the little tube must follow. 

He must have guessed what I in- 
tended. He began to howl with in- 
sane rage, pulling at the time field 
that neatly held him tight to the 
end of the helix. Coldly I judged 
the distance until I was sure I had 
it right. 

I tossed the sander in a high arc. 

It rose, glinting brightly in a 
shaft of sunlight from a stained 
glass window, and arched down.

Striking on the bank of keys, 
then falling off to rattle to the 
floor. 

He’s enraged cries cut off as the 
time helix released and He van- 
ished from sight. At the same mo- 
ment the light changed, dimming 
to dusk. Outside the windows was 
the grayness I had seen before 
during the time attack on the 
laboratory that had started every- 
thing. London, the world outside 
no longer existed, not in this par- 
ticular part of time and space. On- 
ly the cathedral continued be- 
ing, held briefly by the time fix- 
ator. 

Had He won? I felt the first 
touch of worry — the effects of the 
drug had to be wearing off. I 
looked hard, but it was almost im- 
possible to see the indicator 
dials in the dim light. Had one of 
them moved just before the helix 
was actuated? I could not be sure. 
And it didn’t really matter, not to 
me here. Whether the future was 
hell or a paradise of peace could 
not affect me. With the return of 
emotions I felt a desire to know if 
my world would ever be. Would 
there be a Special Corps and 
would my Angelina some day be 
born? I would never know. I 
tugged sharply at the chains. 

They held fast. 

The end. End of everything. The 
emotions that were returning 



were only the blackest and most 
depressed but I could not help it. 
End. 

While I was at the depths, feel- 
ing only the most profound self- 
pity, the sound began. A distant 
whine on the edge of audibility, so 
weak I would never have heard it 
had it not broken an absolute si- 
lence. It grew and grew, as annoy- 
ing as an insect making me aware 
of it although I did not wish to be 
aware of anything except my 
misery. In the end it was quite 
loud, coming from empty space 
somewhere high beneath the 
dome. I looked up despite my lack 
of interest just as there was the 
loud bang of displaced air. 

A figure appeared in the dark- 
ness above, someone in a space- 
suit. Wearing a grav-chute, be- 
cause he drifted down slowly and 
landed in front of me. I was 
stunned and ready for almost any- 
thing when he opened the dark hel- 
met of his spacesuit. 

Ready for almost anything oth- 
er than the fact that he was not a 
he. 

“Get rid of that silly chain,” An- 
gelina said. “You always manage 
to get into trouble as soon as I 
leave you alone. You’re coming 
back with me right now and that is 
all there is to it.” 

I had nothing at all to say. This 
time the last word was surely hers.#

**A11 right,” he said, reluctant- 
ly awake. He had been having a 
good dream of home and full ra- 
tions of cool water to bathe in. A 
dream where loneliness no longer 
existed. 

The voice that had awakened 
him was soft and female and Jyon 
recognized it. Her name was 
Cams and she was pleasant to 
look at. She was a medical as- 
sistant. 

“The doctor requests your pres- 
ence,” she said urgently. “The 
Leader fails. Now, please.” 

Jyon scrambled from near na- 
kedness into his tunic while she 
watched without any evident em- 
barrassment. The tunic fit him 
loosely. He had lost flesh. All of 
the crew had. The relief ship was 
overdue. There was talk that it 
would never come, had never been 
dispatched. Soon the rations 
would have to be cut again. 

Dutifully he followed the girl 
down metallic corridors that 
smelled of oil and age. He thought 
she was aware that he watched her 
and not displeased. She wore no 
man’s mark and so was unat- 
tached. It was long since he had 
paired. He had lost the desire 
when Dari died in a sudden shift- 
ing of the crust of the black world 
below. Now there seemed to be 
too many thoughts he needed to 
hide from others, things he could 
never share. The ship was his. Con- 
flict and bickering over possible 
courses of action grew in feroci- 



ty. He had to make the final deci- 
sions. That was the custom and 
the law. It seemed better to face 
that duty without the additional 
involvement of pairing and shar- 
ing. 

Leader Mzel had been injured 
on the same disastrous day that 
had claimed the life of Dari. The 
sudden land shift had crushed 
Mzel and left him speechless, 
comatose much of the time and 
without reason. Jyon had as- 
sumed command of the strife-rid- 
den ship. 

The doctor waited. 

“He’s conscious,” he said soft- 
ly. “I opened his skull and relieved 
the pressure. He’s very weak and 
presents a poor chance.” He 
shrugged, unwilling to commit 
himself. “He may die — he may 
live. I think there is now some un- 
derstanding within him of what 
is said.” The doctor watched Jyon 
through eyes that had seen much 
and pitied all. “The law says that 
you lead if he dies. Leaders are 
supposed to pass on their secrets 
to those who succeed them. I 
would talk to you about the course 
we must take. But first Leader 
Mzel may have things he wishes to 
tell you.” 

“I understand.” 

J YON entered the sickroom. 

Mzel was strapped to a pallet, 
eyes open, full of pain. Still, Jyon 
saw that those eyes were now able 
to follow him. 



122 



IF 




H e sat beside the pallet and 
took the older man’s hand. 
“You are better,” he said com- 
fortingly. 

Leader Mzel watched him, then 
let his eyes turn away to the table 
near the pallet. Jyon looked that 
way also. On the table was the 
buckle that Mzel had always worn, 
the buckle of the brotherhood. 
Mzel was of the brotherhood. Jyon 
was not., 

Mzel nodded with a tiny mo- 
tion and his eyes returned to Jyon. 
“Take,” he said softly, 

Jyon picked up the belt and 
buckle. Cunningly worked into 
the metal were the familiar fig- 
ures of the Twins, life flask held be- 
tween them. Jyon clasped the buck- 
le, sensing that the older man 
wanted him to do so. 

Mzel’s mouth opened again and 
Jyon leaned close, listening. One 
word came and it was so low it was 
more imagined than heard. 
“Relief?” 

Jyon shook his head. “Not yet. 
Leader. We still wait. Many now 
desire to abandon the watch, 
drive the ship toward home,” He 
nodded, not afraid to muse in front 
of this other man who had known 
command. “No reason other 
than the ancient rules why we 
shouldn’t. The ship theoretical- 
ly could make it home if we left 
soon. If we wait too much longer 
we might have insufficient ra- 
tions for the trip.” He looked down 
and again tried to read Mzel’s eyes. 



“Nothing is left down there. The 
surface is now extremely dan- 
gerous. A poisoned planet, its at- 
mosphere burned away, a worth- 
less place. The disapproval of this 
watch grows among the crew.” 

He leaned forward again, watch- 
ing the listening, but he could not 
be sure of the word Mzel spoke. 

Was it. Stay? 

Jyon shook his head. Much lay 
beyond his understanding. No 
Leader had ever been lost before 
to his knowledge, save through or- 
derly process. But command was 
now his. The ship had been here for 
a score of centuries. The direc- 
tives of the Twin Brotherhood 
said it was to stay here, no matter 
what happened. But that surely 
could be interpreted to mean that 
the ship was to stay with relief. 
Not even the most disapproving 
of the Twin Brotherhood could 
expect otherwise. Yet when his 
own relief party had been in train- 
ing Jyon had known from idle talk 
that there had been indecision 
about whether to send them. The 
maintenance of the ships taxed 
the makeshift civilization that 
sputtered and sparked now on the 
home planet. The civilization 
had arisen since the last time of 
chaos more than two thousand 
years before. Jyon thought that 
the ships were relics of a time old- 
er than that — they were all but in- 
destructible. 

A new dark age approached: 
Wars had broken out between the 



TIME PATROL 



123 




principal cities and only the 
Brotherhood maintained what 
peace remained. An uneasy time. 

He watched the older man who 
had now stopped trying to talk. 
Leader Mzel fought only to live, 
to exist. In a while the tortured 
eyes glazed over and Mzel sank 
back into unconsciousness. 

The doctor waited outside. 

“I think he sleeps,” Jyon said. 
He held the belt and buckle. “He 
wished me to take this.” 

The doctor said, “We monitor 
him constantly. His injuries 
were most severe.” He eyed Jyon. 
“Is there time to talk with me 
now?” 

Jyon knew then that the doctor 
held no hope for Mzel. He sighed. 
“Speak.” 

The doctor lifted a hand that 
trembled slightly. “We must pro- 
ceed home soon. I now have too 
many patients suffering from 
nervous disorders — an alarming 
increase. If we continue to wait 
for relief I mistrust the collec- 
tive sanity of the ship. The times 
were too troubled when we left. 
The crew no longer believes that 
relief is on the way and so there is 
no end in sight for them.” 

Jyon asked, “Would you have us 
leave now and risk the perils of a 
long voyage and have relief come 
after our leaving?” 

“My advice is that we return,” 
the doctor said shortly. “If you 
wish, for your records and to ab- 
solve your conscience and to clear 



you with the Twin Brotherhood, 
which presumably still governs 
at home, I shall be happy to re- 
duce that advice to writing.” 

“Perhaps that would be best. 
Doctor. I haven’t yet made up my 
mind about what course to follow. 
The directives seem clear. This 
ship is to stand watch here. Per- 
haps Mzel, as a member of the 
Brotherhood, had some inkling 
of our purpose. I know not. I only 
know that this watch has lasted as 
long as our history — it reaches 
back to the dark years. Perhaps 
we are to rescue artifacts that 
belch from time to time from the 
tortured matter below — per- 
haps we are here as chroniclers of 
destruction or even as potential 
rescuers of some possible survi- 
vors hidden deep beneath the tor- 
mented crust of the world below 
us.” 

“There can be no survivors. 
None has ever been found in the 
history of the ship,” the doctor 
said. He shook his head. “We serve 
no purpose here except to be in at 
the cremation, perhaps for some 
dark reason of the Brotherhood. 
And how do we know now that the 
Brotherhood still maintains law 
at home?” 

“Write out your recommenda- 
tions, Doctor,” Jyon said without 
emotion. “I’ll consider them. I 
can promise no more for now.” 

H e LEFT the man. It was al- 
most time for watch, but there 



124 



IF 




was time enough to visit the Room ' 
of Ages. He walked there slowly. 
The room was dim and vast. The 
vaulted ceiling was scanty illum- 
inated by a reproduction of the 
home sun and the planets that 
wheeled around it. He found a va- 
cant place and contemplated. 

The room was not a place of re- 
ligion, although many used it as 
such. The Brotherhood was not a 
thing of priests, but of men — men 
who kept the laws, maintained the 
ships, studied what remained of 
the old books. Men who tried. The 
Room of Ages was a part of the 
Brotherhood rule. And because 
he was not completely without 
cynicism Jyon knew that it had 
b^n placed here mainly for those 
who attributed godhood to the 
Twins, for whom no overt worship 
was solicited. 

The four walls of the room were 
covered by enormous pictures. 
On the rear wall was Stac and 
Small. He was in appearance 
much like Jyon himself. The 
clothes were different, but the 
eyes that looked back at Jyon were 
known eyes. On the opposite wall 
was Givan the Great. He differed 
markedly from Stac. He was tall 
and there seemed to be no hair on 
his body. Some men of the Twin 
Brotherhood at home shaved 
theirs to set themselves apart. 
Givan had too many joints in his 
feet and fingers and his eyes were 
set so deep that all one really saw 
were shadows. 



On the back wall, between the 
brothers, was the flask of life. It 
was a huge, black, bottle-shaped 
thing, curiously made. 

The front wall of the room was 
made in the fashion of the buckle 
Mzel had entrusted to Jyon. There 
Stac and Givan again stood, arms 
entwined about each other in 
friendship, the flask held jointly 
by them. 

The legends said that the Twins 
had once lived this way. But no 
man of Jyon’s race who now lived 
had seen one who looked like 
Givan. Jyon wondered what a 
friendship like that would have 
been worth. The drawing was 
from one of the old statues that 
had come through the time of dark- 
ness. Jyon had once seen an origi- 
nal in one of the halls of the Broth- 
erhood at home. Stac was cast in 
light metal and Givan in metal of 
dark green. 

The legends grew dim. Once men 
had risen from the mud — once they 
had journeyed to the far stars. 
That was what remained of the 
legends. Once there had been 
friends around mankind — once 
men had not been lonely and lost. 

O N WATCH he replaced Gy- 
den, now second in command 
and a former friend. When com- 
mand had come to Jyon somehow 
friendships had withered. 

“What news of the Leader?” 
Gyden asked sourly. He had 



TIME PATROL 



125 




probably already heard, Jyon 
thought. 

“Perhaps improved. He under- 
stands again. He can speak.” 

The other nodded and watched 
him cautiously and Jyon thought 
he was going to be proselyted 
again, but Gyden forebore. Gy- 
den"s opinion that they should at- 
tempt return was already well 
known and widely circulated 
within the ship. He was the ac- 
knowledged leader of the return 
group, which Jyon believed grew 
in numbers daily. 

Jyon formally relieved and then 
watched the planet below through 
the scanners. Around him deli- 
cate instruments charted and 
measured, cameras took contin- 
uous pictures. 

The swollen sun had cooked the 
life from what had once most prob- 
ably been a fairly pleasant place. 
First atmosphere and oceans had 
boiled and burned away, then mas- 
sive quakes had shaken the strick- 
en planet. Now the surface was 
unstable and highly dangerous 
to approach. Dari and Mzel were 
not the only casualties. The ship 
had lost a total of nineteen per- 
sons — twenty if Mzel died. That 
was out of a population of less 
than four hundred. 

Jyon watched and waited and 
wondered why he watched, why so 
many generations had persis- 
tently watched. Perhaps it was 
only because the watch had some- 
how begun and now no one, in- 



cluding the Brotherhood, knew 
how to end it. In a way the ships 
were the Brotherhood. 

Perhaps was a thousand, thou- 
sand reasons that no one knew 
now. The ship stayed because the 
ship stayed. The reasons might be 
good — but they were lost. 

Once there had been cities be- 
low and it was possible that be- 
ings somewhat like Jyon’s own 
people had lived in those cities. A 
popular belief aboard the ship 
was that Jyon’s own people might 
once have colonized the world be- 
low — in a forgotten age — and 
how kept watch to retain some 
vestige of sovereignty, for the 
legends had it that once the race 
had been warlike and proud. 

Around Jyon other members of 
the watch came and went in end- 
less routine. He could feel eyes on 
him, curious eyes, angry eyes, 
even eyes that seemed to plot re- 
bellion. He had a strong feeling 
that when he made his decision 
about return that decision might 
not be the final one. 

He had therefore taken some 
precautions. 

In the Leader’s cabin, which he 
now occupied at least temporar- 
ily, were secret primary controls 
for the ship. Mzel, perhaps with a 
premonition of disaster, had 
shown these controls to him in 
the good times before rations 
had shortened. Jyon had never 
shown them to Gyden. The cabin 
could be sealed off so that unau- 



126 



IF 




thorized entry would be time-con- 
suming and difficult. He hoped 
necessity would not force him to 
last resorts, but the ship could be 
conned and the bleak world below 
scanned independently from that 
cabin. Without control of the 
cabin no one could immediate- 
ly take the ship from orbit and 
compute it into a course toward 
the home sun. Only in time and 
with much effort could the. cabin 
control be overridden. 

Halfway into the watch a thing 
Jyon had come to dread happened. 
The scanners found a variance. 
The coordinates were called out 
and half a hundred pairs of eyes 
moved in and over and scanned that 
variance, compared it with pic- 
tures taken on the last pass of the 
area. It seemed to be no mere crust 
upheaval. Something was down 
there that had not been there be- 
fore. 

Jyon was a veteran of a hundred 
similar happenings. The rules 
were simple enough. A scout 
should be launched to investi- 
gate. That rule had begun to cost 
lives. The odds for survival upon 
landing were poor. 

And yet it seemed to Jyon that if 
he broke routine that routine was 
finished for all time. So he would 
go — but he would avoid landing. 

H e ordered the waiting 
crew: “To Scout Three. I will 
command. .Temporary com- 
mand here to the next in line.” 



That meant someone would call 
Gyden out of .bis sleep. Jyon as- 
sembled his exploratory crew of 
ten, took the scout down and 
skimmed the surface of the plan- 
et. Close in, in the darkness, all 
that was revealed to sight and in- 
struments was an enormous 
mound of matter. A thing had 
pushed its way out of the planet’s 
interior and loomed now, still 
hideously hot from the sunward 
side. Jyon held the ship above it 
and calculated chances. There 
really seemed no easy, safe way to 
get the ship down even if he wanted 
to land. Instead he played power- 
ful beams of light upon the earth- 
vomited artifact and had pic- 
tures made. They showed a long 
vaguely formed body partially 
thrust through the crust. The lines 
of the thing had uniformity and 
seemed more than amorphous — 
perhaps manufactured — perhaps a 
tunnel belched out from far below 
by those terrible underground pres- 
sures. It was much too large for 
removal. What he saw seemed to 
be only a part of it with much more 
underground. It seemed to be of 
metal, dulled and deeply colored 
by long interment in the earth. 

In the ship above were books 
showing what had come up from 
the ground over the long watch, but 
no one was familiar with them 
any more, for the ship’s scribe was 
among the dead. It was possible 
that what was being unearthed 
had appeared before and had 



TIME PATROL 



127 




been investigated. Jyon hesi- 
tated, still studying pictures. He 
allowed time to pass as the thing 
below moved toward the sun side. 
There the scout ship could not fol- 
low. The sun was too hot, the cool- 
ants in the tiny ship too ineffi- 
cient. 

As he watched the crust shifted 
agonizingly again and more of 
the long body appeared. It widened 
and seemed to be wider still in that 
portion yet concealed within the 
planet. 

A patch of white heat broke 
from the bottom of the gray sky. 
The sun. 

Reluctantly Jyon ordered re- 
turn. He would study the object 
further from the ship. 

W HEN he boarded he was met 
by four men. They waited 
upon him warily, their manner 
determined but respectful. Their 
spokesman had hard eyes that 
shone now with purpose. 

He said, “Leader Gyden has 
taken command of the ship with 
the purpose of returning us 
home. We have been sent to attend 
you.” 

Jyon smiled. 

“Good,” he said. 

The four watched him without 
return smiles. 

Jyon said, “I’m glad the deci- 
sion is no longer mine. I now ex- 
press my sympathies.” 

“I see,” the spokesman said, 
seeming to relax a little. 



“Take me to my cabin, please,” 
Jyon said. “I’m tired after the 
long shift.” 

They conferred quietly and then 
took him there. They made a cur- 
sory inspection of the room, 
found nothing to cause them con- 
cern, left and closed the door. Jyon 
waited for a moment or two and 
then carefully and quietly locked 
the door from the inside, turned 
the huge bolts that Mzel had shown 
him, and pushed down the second- 
ary shields that secured the room 
from anything but the most deter- 
mined and continuous onslaught. 

He opened the concealed wall 
panel as Mzel had shown him. 
Then he locked in the set of over- 
riding controls so that the cen- 
turies-long vigil around the 
doomed world below would con- 
tinue. The course had not yet been 
changed, but he imagined that Gy- 
den was plotting a new one in the 
central control room. 

The cabin held a tiny scanner. 
He set its coordinates so that he 
could monitor the new object 
when the region came around 
again. Then he slept. His sleep was 
exhausted and without dreams. 

He awoke to a muffled banging 
on the door. He smiled to himself. 
Gyden’s people must have dis- 
covered that their controls were 
inoperative and finally de- 
duced that he might have some- 
thing to do with it. They were 
working on the door. But if the 
specifications Mzel had shown 



128 



IF 




him were right the men would work 
a long time before they gained en- 
trance. 

He turned on the voice system 
at the control panel and set it for 
all outlets. 

“This is Acting Leader Jyon,” 
he said. “I am controlling the 
ship from my cabin.” 

Gyden’s voice came back quick- 
ly: “Open the door for us, Jyon. 
We voted while you were on scout. 
Many more wished to return home 
than wished to stay and hope for 
relief.” 

He fell silent for a moment, 
waiting for Jyon to speak, but 
Jyon said nothing. 

Gyden’s voice returned, full of 
conviction: “If we stay here we 
will all die.” 

“Then we’ll die,” Jyon said sim- 
ply. “Leader Mzel said we should 
stay. There is a reason. Our race 
has endured the high cost of main- 
taining the watch for too long for 
there not to be a reason.” 

“No,” Gyden said. “Now open 
the door for us. Otherwise we will 
not furnish you with food and will 
cut off your cabin water.” 

“We need not talk further,” 
Jyon said frigidly. 

T he cabin contained the record 
books that listed and por- 
trayed the artifacts taken and ob- 
served from the world below. 
There were rows of the books, huge 
pages of pictures and other pages 
covered with the spidery writing 



of past ship’s scribes. The current 
book was in the central control 
room. These were the books of the 
past. He had lacked time to exam- 
ine them. Now he had plenty of 
time. 

The pictures were of bits of ma- 
chinery, delicate pottery shards, 
metallic instruments, building 
blocks, shaped metals and the rest 
of the flotsam and jetsam of a 
long-vanished race. But there 
didn’t seem to be anything re- 
motely like what Jyon had seen on 
the last trip down. 

The record books were fasci- 
nating. They gave only minor 
hints at the reasons for the long 
vigil, reasons Jyon had already 
deduced and cast aside. Primari- 
ly the books chronicled results. 

With the books it was easier to 
imagine that a sentient race had 
lived on the grim world below and 
he could even imagine what that 
race had been like — intelligent, 
mechanized, complex, even lovers 
of beauty. 

Jyon read and argued with him- 
self about the sun. It seemed posi- 
tive that it had begun its final 
death process long before the 
watch ship appeared in the area 
and surely all life had vanished an 
eon before the watch had begun. 
The records seemed to bear that 
out for nowhere was pictured any 
artifact that did not show the eL 
fects of both heat and age. When 
had those who had lived below dis- 
covered what was going to hap- 



TIAAE PATROL 



129 




pen to their sun? Where had they 
fled? 

Men outside still worked at the 
room, attempting to gain en- 
trance, but the attempts seemed 
sporadic now. Perhaps they were 
ready to give up and seek other al- 
ternatives. Perhaps they would find 
a way around the locked controls. 
Jyon no longer really cared as the 
days fled past. 

Below the ship’s orbit the huge 
body that had erupted from the 
ground lay quietly, barely dis- 
trubed by the almost constant tre- 
mors. Jyon watched it for a few 
days, then moved to other pur- 
suits, leaving the scanner coor- 
dinated to it. 

His new interest was hunger. 
Before he had secluded himself 
the ship’s meals had been skimpy, 
providing barely enough nutri- 
ent value to sustain life. Now there 
was, of course, nothing. 

The water tap continued to 
run. He had filled all the contain- 
ers he had been able to find after 
the threat, but as yet had had no 
need to resort to them. 

He hungered. 

The mirror let him see his face 
become old and gaunt with a sud- 
denness that was frightening. In a 
very short time movement be- 
came perilous for he was con- 
stantly lightheaded and dizzy. 

The days passed and finally 
pain ceased to be associated with 
his hunger, it became a mental 
thing, a knowing that someplace 



there was food. That place became 
more distant every day so that as 
the time quickly passed the place 
of food became almost an imag- 
inary thing. Despite the voices 
that came from the speaker, ca- 
joling him to open the door, he no 
longer believed that opening the 
door would bring food. Existence 
in the world he built of his hunger 
had to be more complicated than 
that. 

A fter many days he recog- 
nized Gyden’s voice as it came 
over the speaker. He listened to it 
stolidly from his pallet. 

“We have completed bypass- 
ing your controls. Leader Jyon. 
Mzel is dead and you are now lead- 
er. We ask you to open your door, 
remove the shields and help us re- 
turn. Your conduct has been 
honorable, but surely you have 
done all you need to do. None of us 
desires your death. The medical 
staff fears you will die if you don’t 
receive food soon. In a very short 
time we will leave the orbit here 
and proceed on a course to home. 
I ask not that you open to us until 
then, but when you see that the or- 
bit has changed then open to us, so 
that you may live and not die.” 

Jyon crawled from his pallet to- 
ward the controls. Cautiously he 
worked them, but nothing hap- 
pened. Gyden had not lied. 

He peered into the scanner. 
The orbit appeared still to be the 
same. He concentrated on what 



130 



IF 




lay below and a wave of sickness 
and dizziness came and he looked 
away and then determinedly 
back. Mzel’s belt and buckle lay 
next to the scanner, where he had 
discarded them. 

Nothing had changed below. 

It was only that the great body 
that had come from the earth be- 
low reminded him of something, 
made him look down again. 

This scanner was smaller than 
those in the main control room. 
He rose to his feet and operated 
the shields. Then, clumsily, he 
threw back the massive bolts of 
the door. Two guards greeted him 
in friendly fashion, but their eyes 
mirrored shock at his appear- 
ance. 

“Take me now to the main con- 
trol room,” he said urgently. He 
tottered to them and felt strong 
arms hold his own weak ones and 
guide him. 

Gyden and two dozen others 
were working in the control 
room. All sound stopped as Jyon 
entered. 

“Before you leave orbit,” Jyon 
said in a voice that was almost 
lost, “please try to open that arti- 
fact below. It seems to me to be 
like a great bottle — a flask — I 
beg — please — ” 

He lost all control and black- 
ness came. 

In his dreams he saw food. 

In the dreams Mzel still com- 
manded and Dari lived. It was how 
he recognized it as a dream. 



W HEN he came out of it he 
was in the infirmary. Nee- 
dles jutted from his arm and his 
breathing was aided by a respira- 
tor. 

The female Cams watched him 
and smiled when he looked at her. 

“You will be all right now,” she 
said. 

“Where are we?” he asked and 
the question made bitter memo- 
ries return. “How long have I 
been — ” 

She touched his lips with a quiet- 
ing finger. “Not too much talk 
now. We still remain in orbit. The 
doctor and Subleader Gyden 
have been waiting for a long time 
to talk with you. Leader Jyon.” 

She moved away and all was 
quiet for a while. When she re- 
turned she brought the doctor and 
Gyden. Gyden walked softly, as 
if afraid that the sound of his feet 
would bring harm to Jyon. The 
doctor moved close to the pallet. 

“You will be quiet and listen,” 
he ordered Jyon. “I command here 
and you came within reach of 
death.” He looked away and then 
back. “You have started a great ar- 
gument about what we found 
down there by your insistence 
that we stay.” He smiled gently. 

Gyden nodded seriously. 
“Those who have made the Twins a 
religious thing say that we have 
found the flask of life. Others say 
that we’ve found the treasures that 
our civilization lost in the times 
of chaos, those things that once 



TIME PATROL 



131 




made us great. Inside that thing 
down there, insulated complete- 
ly against the heat, guarded by me- 
tals we only dimly understand, 
we found a rich treasure of films 
and books, machines and draw- 
ings, knowledge — even history. 
An infinity of things that will en- 
rich our race, give our people pur- 
pose.” 

The doctor smiled again. “Yes- 
terday we counseled with the oth- 
er ship’s leaders and theorized. 
Only many years of study will give 
us real answers, but we can still at- 
tempt to understand. We believe 
that once we, and perhaps others, 
lived on that world below many 
thousand of years before this 
watch began. Perhaps it was our 
ancestral home. When the sun be- 
gan its change our people built in 
panic and we fled to our present 
home. Perhaps we lost those 
things we have found below over 
the years of darkness, so that 
when the watch began it was only 
known that we had once lived there 
and that something might be 
found that would be of benefit. 
Perhaps the ones who set the first 
watch knew that the thing we found 
existed, or at least hoped it 
existed.” 

Gyden shook his head. “There 
are great paintings, statuary. Ti- 
ny films show a million million 
things we have lost.” 

“Perhaps this we have found is 
the sole reason for the Brother- 
hood. Only a belief — a reli- 



gion — could have survived the vio- 
lent passage of time,” the doctor 
said. 

Gyden leaned forward, his face 
earnest. “Still we hunger. Those 
on the home world now also hun- 
ger for knowledge of this. The 
times of darkness draw nigh there. 
Please say to us that we should re- 
turn.” 

They watched him. 

Jyon raised his head weakly. 
“Were there paintings and sta- 
tues in what you recovered such as 
those we now call the Twins?” 

The doctor nodded. “Many 
such. That is why I said perhaps 
we once occupied this place with 
others.” 

“Then calculate our food. See if 
anything in what we have found 
can be used for new food. We must 
stay as long as we can.” He re- 
membered the drawings, the 
buckle, the statue he’d seen long 
ago. 

Those two in the statue had 
found something worth more than 
mere knowledge, mere treasure, 
mere learning. It could be seen in 
their carved faces, in the arms held 
tight in friendship. 

“We are here,” Jyon said slow- 
ly. “Once we fled and lost. Per- 
haps those others remained. Now 
let us await and watch with all we 
have for as long as we can. We 
have found our flask of know- 
ledge. Let us wait to see if we now 
can find those who helped us to at- 
tain and hold it.” •

SHELTERING 
1 DREAM 



1 



Duncan had to choose 
between two realities. 
Yet in the end there 
was no choice . 



DORIS PISERCHIA 



^^HEY had put him into a con- 
cavity of steel — windowless, no 
bars, nothing even to tell where 
the dim light was coming from. 

\ There was nothing here besides 

his own bruised, bewildered, out- 
raged self. If the cell had been 



134 



padded he would have known they 
thought him insane. The walls 
were smooth steel. No, the thing 
was a jail, all right, and by God 
somebody was going to pay for 
this outrage before the day was 
out. 

He listened anxiously. All he 
could hear was his own breathing. 

He sat down again on the cold 
floor. The sensible thing to do was 
wait. Calmly. Not let them know 
he was afraid. They would enjoy 
his fear. That clod, that stone-faced 
blockhead, who had shoved him in 
here was a sadist who probably 
thought he was a nobody. Well, he 
would show him. He would make a 
phone call and then the fur would 
fly. 

He leaped to his feet and at- 
tacked the steel door with his fists. 
After an interminable length of 
time the door slid back and Stone- 
face stood there — blue-clad, beefy 
and looking unintelligent. 

“What is it?” Stoneface asked. 

“The law says I’m entitled to one 
phone call,” he said, constricting 
his throat muscles so that the 
words would not come out as a 
croak. 

He moved back a step to make it 
obvious that he had no intention 
of trying to bolt through the door. 
It would not help to antagonize 
this moron. He felt new confi- 
dence pouring through him. 

SHELTERING DREAM 



Seconds later he felt it drain out 
of him in one big bubble for 
Stoneface was frowning at him 
and saying, “What is law?” 

He knew his own expression 
was collapsing into stupid disbe- 
lief. 

“Don’t start that again,” he said 
angrily. “It won’t work. I’m a de- 
cent, law-abiding citizen who’s 
been locked up without even be- 
ing charged. You can’t get away 
with it. I demand that you let me 
call my lawyer.” 

Stoneface stared. 

“What is lawyer?” he asked cu- 
riously. 

When Duncan only glared at 
him he walked out. As the door 
began to slide shut, Duncan’s rage 
exploded. 

“How long are you going to 
keep me in here?” 

“Until they come,” answered 
Stoneface before the edge of the 
door met the panel with a depres- 
singclang. 

I wont, Duncan thought. He 
would be damned if he would 
scream. He wouldn’t give them the 
satisfaction of listening to his fear. 
He rubbed a sore place on his arm. 

Until they come . 

“They,” Duncan mumbled. 

The word had sounded strange- 
ly emphatic as Stoneface had 
used it — as if he had uttered some 
Finality. 

135 




“THEY,” Duncan said again, 
trying to give it the proper inflec- 
tion, decipher its meaning. What 
could they mean? A firing squad? 
Were THEY going to shoot him 
because he had resisted arrest? 

Stop it, he told himself sternly. 
Firing squads had gone out with 
capital punishment. 

He sat down again, his back 
against the wall, so exhausted he 
could scarcely go through the me- 
chanics of thinking. 

E THOUGHT he must have 
slept for when he opened his 
eyes the door was sliding back and 
two tall shadows were moving to- 
ward him. 

“They” were here. He sat up 
straight and fought his urge to 
cringe against the wall. Savagely 
he forced his mind to focus on only 
one thought. If they tried to drag 
him out he would put up the fight 
of his life. 

Neither man made a move to 
touch him. Both stood inside the 
doorway and simply looked at 
him for a long moment before 
one of them snapped his fingers 
smartly. This was evidently a 
signal to Stoneface because he 
went away and returned with two 
collapsible chairs. 

They were tall and roughly 
dressed in high heavy boots, thick 
trousers and shirts. They sat down 



rather hesitantly and Contin- 
ued to look at him while he made a 
suspicious examination of His own. 
They were middle-aged, past fifty 
anyway, but they looked to be in 
good shape. 

“Are you going to pretend 
you’re brainless like your guard?” 
he asked, gripping his knees to still 
their trembling. “Because if you 
are you’re wasting your time. I 
can wait this thing out just as long 
as I have to.” 

“We’re not going to pretend 
anything,” one of them said and 
Duncan jerked his head quickly 
to look at him. 

The man was ruddy-cheeked and 
perspiring as though he had just 
stepped from a steam bath. Which 
was impossible. The evening 
temperature must be about sixty, 
though it had been higher that 
afternoon when Stoneface had 
marched into Duncan’s house and 
arrested him. 

“Who are you?” he demanded, 
expecting no answer. 

“My name is Rand. This is Mr. 
Dee vers.” 

He eyed them in desperation. 
They looked as normal as any 
crooked cops but the sight of them 
did things to him. Not just because 
they were staring at him as if he 
had eight legs, but because they 
were free to go wherever they 
wished, while he knew that all he 




136 



IF 




had to do was make one quick 
move toward the open door be- 
fore they blasted him. 

Deevers was as sallow as Rand 
was ruddy, as if all the color had 
been drained from his skin. He 
looked worn out. They both did. 
Why weren’t they wearing uni- 
forms? Why were they dressed like 
this? 

He folded his arms and glared at 
them. He would see himself in hell 
before he asked them why he had 
been arrested. It would be the 
same as begging. 

The one called Deevers gave his 
head an impatient jerk and Rand 
spoke again. 

“We have to ask you a few 
questions,’’ he said. “Then maybe 
we can answer some of yours.” 

He smiled awkwardly, perhaps 
expecting to dent Duncan’s 
armor of hostility. 

The smile told Duncan one 
thing. If they had murder on their 
minds they did not intend to get to 
it immediately. 

“Fire away,” he said coldly. 

“When did you first notice that 
your identity tag was gone?” 

N ot that again. Not the identi- 
fication card again. Duncan 
sagged against the wall, spent and 
beginning to feel ill. A lousy piece 
of paper that didn’t mean a damn 
thing. 

SHELTERING DREAM 



“I don’t know,” he mumbled. 

“Think,” Rand urged, 

“It wasn’t a tag. It was an or- 
dinary identification card. I was 
looking for something in my 
wallet and the card dropped out. It 
fell into a gutter and washed down 
the drain.” 

Rand leaned forward. 

“Where were you when this hap- 
pened?” 

“I’d just left work and was on 
my way home.” 

“What city?” Deevers snapped 
at him suddenly. 

“Go to hell!” he snapped back. 

Deevers grimaced and sat back 
in his chair. He looked at Rand. 

“We’re wasting time.” 

Duncan tasted the sweat on his 
upper lip. “If it’s a case of identi- 
fication I’ve more than enough 
evidence of who I am. There’s my 
birth certificate.” 

They stared at him as if he had 
said something obscene. Rand 
seemed to be trying to mask his 
emotions but Deevers made no at- 
tempt to conceal his disgust. 

“Where is it?” Rand said at last. 

“Stoneface has it. Your man 
outside.” 

Rand looked at Deevers. 

“Go get it.” 

Deevers scowled as he stood up. 

“I still say we ought to finish it 
right now.” 

Rand kept his eyes focused on 

137 




the floor and didn’t look up until 
the other came back. He took the 
slip of paper from Deevers’ hand 
and looked at it for a long minute. 

“Where do you suppose he found 
this?’’ he said in quiet bafflement. 

“There must be plenty of scraps 
around. This looks like part of a 
bill of—” 

“I tell you, he wouldn’t know 
where to look.” 

“Come on, Dave. You don’t 
know what he was doing before he 
was brought in. He’s been wan- 
dering all over the place.” 

By God, they could quit talking 
as if he weren’t sitting right here 
listening to them. The birth cer- 
tificate evidently meant no more 
to them than it had to Stoneface. 
Oh, that had been a cute scene. 

Just a minute, Duncan had said, 
offended but absolutely sure of 
himself. / may have lost my iden- 
tification card but that doesnt 
mean I dont exist any more. What 
kind of nonsense is this? / still 
have some rights. 

And Stoneface had asked. What 
are rights? 

Yes, those had been the words. 
And Duncan had yanked the birth 
certificate from his wallet and 
shoved it in the idiot’s face, con- 
vinced that if that didn’t satisfy 
the fool nothing would. God, but 
he had been right about that. 

After reading the data out loud 



Stoneface had asked, What is 
father? What is mother? What is 
birth? 

Duncan saw Rand start to throw 
the birth certificate away, then 
give him a quick glance and stick it 
into his pocket. They mistook him 
for someone else, Duncan knew. 
Someone had done something 
and Deever and Rand thought he 
was the guilty party. And if he 
didn’t get off his lard in a hurry the 
thing was going to get too far out 
of hand. 

“I didn’t do it,” he said. “You’ve 
got the wrong man.” 

“What did your identification 
card look like?” asked Rand as 
though he hadn’t heard a word. 

They cant keep this up, said the 
babbler in Duncan’s mind. Some 
time somebody had to start mak- 
ing sense. He knew he was doing 
himself no good shuddering and 
jerking the way he was doing, but 
some demon in his brain kept 
warning that if he didn’t let loose 
in some manner he would end the 
day as insane as these two. 

“It was w'hite, three by two 
inches, approximately,” he said. 
“It carried my name, address, 
physical description and draft 
status.” 

“And it was white?” 

“I said it was white.” 

Deevers was looking at him with 
open distaste. 



138 



IF 




Rand propped a boot on one 
knee and idly scraped debris from 
it. 

“What did it look like after it 
fell out of your wallet?” 

W HAT did it look like? With a 
sense of doom he had 
watched the white card being 
swept away in the muddy tor- 
rent. It had disappeared into the 
drain among leaves and mud. What 
the hell? he remembered himself 
asking out loud. He had been sur- 
prised when he had found himself 
kneeling by the gutter and even 
more surprised to discover that 
his body trembled. For a second 
he had thought the white card had 
changed color and shape just be- 
fore it fell into the drain. It had 
looked strangely metallic and 
spherical, green and utterly un- 
familiar there in the wash. 

“It looked green,”, he said and 
caught himself at once. “No, it 
was white. I told you — it was 
white.” 

Rand’s fingers had frozen on his 
boot and now he glared at Deevers 
with a savage little grin twisting 
his lips. 

Deevers shrugged and shook his 
head. 

“Doesn’t mean a thing.” 

“The devil it doesn’t.” 

Duncan had said out loud to 
himself. What the hell? and it 



made him feel real again. All he 
had done was drop his identity 
card out of his wallet. It could 
happen to anyone and often did. 
What would he do about it? Get an- 
other, of course. Or make himself 
one. An identification card was a 
meaningless object, not even an 
actual symbol. A piece of paper 
could never represent the sum 
total of a man with a functioning 
brain and body. 

“It doesn’t make any difference 
what color it was,” he said faintly, 
looking at Deevers. 

“It’s very important,” said 
Rand. 

“I can’t see that it matters. If 
you want to find out who I am it 
should be simple.” 

“We already know who you 
are,” replied Deevers, grim 
amusement on his face. 

Something fell within Duncan’s 
stomach, a hot weight that seemed 
to drop without end. 

“Then why don’t you let me out 
of here?” he asked. “At least let me 
call my lawyer.” 

Rand looked away. 

“I’m afraid you can’t call him.” 

“Why not?” 

“Long distance rates, you 
know,” remarked Deevers with an 
open sneer. 

Rand shot him an annoyed 
glance. 

“Knock it off.”

“We’re wasting time.” 

“You can’t expect to solve this in 
a few hours.” 

“I don’t expect to solve it at all,” 
said Deevers. “It’s a measly point 
zero zero two percent. I say we 
mark him and the others like him 
off as annual loss and forget it.” 

“No.” 

“We’ve gone through this rou- 
tine a dozen times and we haven’t 
learned a thing.” 

Duncan stared at them in be- 
wilderment, the falling sensation 
in his stomach robbing him of 
strength. He placed his hands flat 
on the floor and braced himself. 
Slowly, laboriously, he began to 
stand up. 

Deevers’ face took on an expres- 
sion of alarm. “Let’s get out,” he 
said swiftly. 

“Wait — ” cried Duncan in dis- 
may, getting his feet under him. 

By the time he was erect and 
halfway across the room both men 
were outside and the door was 
sliding shut. It halted a foot from 
the panel and Rand looked in at 
him. 

“You mustn’t ever do that 
again,” he said. 

“Do what?” Duncan stared back 
at him and then in fury and des- 
peration shouted, “Let me out! 
You can’t leave me here!” 

He heard Deevers chuckle. 

“I haven’t done anything! If you 



think I’ve committed a crime at 
least tell me what it is — ” 

Rand shook his head patiently. 
“ Y ou’ ve committed no crime.” 
“All right.” Duncan’s voice was 
a whine — his legs were water. “I’m 
a worm and you’re God Almighty 
but let me out of here.” 

“I can’t.” 

“Tell me why!” 

“Because you’re insane.” 

H e recoiled from the pain 
of the words, slamming up 
hard against the cell wall, hurting 
his back and his head. He stared 
about his prison, then turned to 
Rand. Dread choked his throat. 

“I don’t believe you,” he said, 
reaching through the opening just 
as the man stepped back. “This 
isn’t a sanitarium. Where are the 
doctors? The nurses? What is this 
place?” 

Rand eyed him warily. “It’s a 
storage room, the only place we 
have to put you in. Don’t try to fig- 
ure things out. You’ll only hurt 
yourself.” 

Then his face was gone from the 
opening. 

Duncan began to pace the floor, 
certain he had worn a rut in it by 
the time he gave up. He examined 
the walls of his cell. A smoother 
steel he had never placed his hands 
upon. It felt like glass and the 
rounded corners were as un-

IF 




marred as the rest, giving no hint 
of yielding to the pressure of his 
back muscles. 

He was not insane. They were 
trying to drive him out of his mind 
or make him doubt his sanity. And 
he wasn’t in any jail. Stoneface’s 
uniform had fooled him but now 
he knew it wasn’t genuine. The 
police station was phony. But this 
wasn’t an asylum. It must be just 
what Rand had said it was, a stor- 
age room, but like no other Dun- 
can had ever seen. A bulldozer 
would have had difficulty plow- 
ing its way through the thick door. 

He stretched out on the cold 
steel and laid his head on his arms. 
By God, something reasonable 
was bound to emerge from all this 
sooner or later and when it did he 
was going to raise a hue and cry 
that would put Rand and Deevers 
behind bars where they belonged. 

He was drowsing when Rand 
came back. When he saw the man 
was not going to open the door 
Duncan didn’t bother to get up. 
He propped his chin on his arms 
and watched as the other squinted 
through the narrow opening and 
finally located him. 

“We have to talk some more.” 

“About the card, naturally,” 
Duncan retorted sarcastically. 

Rand smiled dryly^ 

“As a matter of fact, yes. It’s 
very important, you know.” 



“No, I don’t know. All I know is 
that you look like a sane sort of 
person, not at all like a kidnaper. 
Who are you working for? Some 
espionage outfit? Because you’re 
wasting your time. I haven’t any 
secrets.” 

Rand sighed as he leaned against 
the panel. 

“Concentrate on the tag. I mean 
the card. How did you feel when 
you saw it lying in the gutter?” 
“Nuts.” 

“Try to answer.” 

“I didn’t feel anything. Why 
should I?” 

“I think you’re lying.” 

“Nuts.” 

“Believe me, it isn’t.” 

“Believe you? That’s good.” 
“Did you feel angry?” asked 
Rand patiently. 

“No.” 

“Sad?” 

“Of course not.” 

“Happy?” 

“Ha-ha.” 

“Did you feel a sense of doom?” 
Duncan clutched his head and 
writhed onto his back. 

“Nan!” he yelled. 

Rand gripped the edge of the 
door. “Who’s Nan?” 

“My wife, you fool!” howled 
Duncan. 

“Your wife?” 

His wife. His loving wife. 

She had asked. What happened? 

141 



SHELTERING DREAM 




Were you in an accident? Did you 
fall? 

He had just stepped into the 
house — tired, hungry and growing 
angry because there was no food 
on the table. She had kept nagging 
at him with her fool questions un- 
til he had lost his temper and had 
sworn at her. That had made him 
contrite and he had tried to kiss 
her. She had held him off while she 
stared at his chest with a horrified 
expression on her face. Then she 
had marched to the phone and — 
for crying out loud — had called 
the police. 

“She’s ill,” he groaned to Rand. 
“I have to get out of here.” Rand 
was staring at him with a disbe- 
lieving look. 

“When are you going to stop 
this?” Duncan demanded, try- 
ing to put some grit into his voice 
and failing. 

“I can’t stop.” 

All right. Enough was enough. 

“At least bring me a cot to lie 
down on,” he said. “How would 
you enjoy sleeping on steel?” 

“I’m sorry about that,” Rand 
said. “I should have thought.” 

“Well?” 

“I’ll send one in with N — with 
Stoneface.” 

As Rand went away Duncan 
grinned savagely and stole to his 
feet. He had to do it. He had to get 
out one way or another. 



H e was in the corner beside 
the door when Stoneface 
opened it and carried in a cot. The 
man had no warning at all. He was 
setting the bed down when Dun- 
can’s bunched fists crashed down 
on his neck. 

He saw the differences immedi- 
ately when he stepped out of the 
cell. Someone had taken the police 
station away. He was now in an in- 
credibly small enclosure, all of it 
made of steel, with a small door be- 
side his prison and another one ten 
feet away. 

Oh God. Before his dread could 
begin to build he cut it off sharp- 
ly. It was all right, he thought 
steadily. Let them switch things 
around. It wasn’t going to stop 
him for a second. 

He pressed on the door beside 
the cell and it slid back a fraction 
of an inch. Sucking in his breath, 
he stiffened to immobility as he 
overheard Rand and Deevers talk- 
ing. 

“Conscience is a function of in- 
telligence,” Rand was saying with 
quiet heat. “Where the devil is 
yours, since you’re so bright?” 

“I don’t believe in wasting it,” 
was Deevers’ blunt reply. 

“We’re responsible. We did it to 
him, you and I.” 

“So we did it. You’ve enough 
business sense for me not to have 
to tell you what to do.” 



142 



IF 




“Blast you, he’ll go into the 
Atomizer soon enough!’’ 

Duncan pressed on the door and 
it slid back. Inside the room he 
pressed the door shut and stepped 
behind a row of tall cartons. He 
still couldn’t see them. He moved 
toward the sound of their voices. 

“It happened because he lost his 
identity tag,’’ said Rand dogged- 
ly, as if he were repeating a tire- 
some theme. 

“That’s screwy.’’ 

“It’s the growth unit that’s 
screwy.’’ 

Deevers’ voice turned frigid. 
“Now what are you suggesting?’’ 

A sound of disgust, then: “Don’t 
worry, we can stop this without 
your losing money.’’ 

“So you’re convinced you have 
it all figured out?” 

“I am. My theory is that when 
he lost his identity tag he went into 
a state of shock. Suddenly he was 
no one. He couldn’t stand it and he 
immediately fell back on his sub- 
conscious. Damn it, don’t sneer. 
It’s obvious he has one. Where 
else does he get his memories? 
Don’t you see? He couldn’t stand 
being a nonentity. He had to be 
somebody.” 

What Deevers saw had nothing 
to do with what Rand was saying. 
His eyes widened in shock and his 
already pale face turned a dull 
shade of gray as he spied Duncan 



standing behind the cartons. He 
overturned his coffee cup as his 
hands flew apart in a motion of 
fright. 

An abrupt stiffening in Rand’s 
back was the only sign that Rand, 
too was aware. 

“I’m younger and bigger than 
the both of you and I’m desper- 
ate,” Duncan said. “Don’t do any- 
thing stupid.” 

“Don’t come any closer!” 
croaked Deevers. His hand shot 
into the air, fingers splayed, and 
stayed there as though it could hold 
Duncan back. “Where’s the 
guard?” 

“I knocked him out. Don’t 
worry. I didn’t hurt him.” 

“Oh — oh, my God,” Deevers 
breathed and then his eyes darted 
to Rand. “You and your damned 
psychology!” 

Rand turned slowly in his chair. 
The color was gone from his face 
but he appeared to be calm and 
unalarmed. 

“He isn’t dangerous,” he said 
quietly. 

Duncan stepped cautiously 
from behind the cartons, his body 
rigid with apprehension. 

T hey had been drinking coffee. 

He filed the item as insignifi- 
cant. The table was littered with 
cigarette stubs. Another item of 
non-danger. Two bunks hugged a

wall and an old oil-burner warmed 
a coffee pot. The cartons and 
boxes flanking the walls bore food 
labels. An open closet revealed 
several articles of clothing — coats, 
hoods, boots — and a pair of weird 
outfits like rubberized diving suits 
hung from a wall hook. 

He saw no weapons at all, not 
until he turned and saw the gun 
Deevers was pointing at him. 

Rand must have sensed his 
alarm because he spun toward 
Deevers and snapped, “Put that 
away!” 

The gun wavered in Deevers’ 
grasp. “What’s he going to do?” 

Duncan’s hands squeezed into 
fists. “You’ve got no right to 
shoot me,” he said. “I haven’t 
done anything.” 

“He’s right,” said Rand. “Put it 
down.” 

Deevers trembled in indeci- 
sion. Suddenly he tossed the gun 
to the floor and watched it skid to 
rest at Duncan’s feet. 

“Go on,” he said huskily. 
“Pick it up. You’re the boss here.” 

“I don’t want the gun. I want 
out.” 

“There’s no place to go,” Rand 
said in a strange voice that grated 
on Duncan’s spine. 

“I want to go home.” 

“This isn’t—” 

“Let him go!” Deevers ground 
out through clenched teeth. 



“Can’t you get it through your 
thick head that he’s suffering?” 

“Go on,” Deevers said to Dun- 
can, a tight grin on his mouth. 
“You’re free. Don’t listen to him. 
He’s crazier than you are.” 

His throat dry, Duncan started 
toward the door. He was almost 
there when Rand called to him with 
such urgency that he hesitated 
in spite of himself. 

The man sat forward in his 
chair, his head drooping between 
his knees and his gaze focused 
blankly on his hands. 

“When you go out make sure 
you close all the doors after you,” 
he said. “And when you come back 
be sure to do the same.” 

“I’m not coming back.” 

“You will. The delusion began 
breaking up the moment you said 
that tag was green. Just remem- 
ber what I’m saying. Our lives de- 
pend on it.” He raised his head and 
gave Duncan an exhausted look. 
“Don’t blame us too much. We 
didn’t mean to do it.” 

There was no call for Rand to 
tremble, Duncan thought. It was 
just another tVick to keep him 
here until they finished whatever 
it was they’d begun. To the devil 
with Rand and Deever — both! He 
was free, wasn’t he? 

Free, free — he had never known 
freedom to be so exalting, so 
mind-staggeringly exhilarating. He 



144 



IF 




raced toward the world outside as 
though he had been gone from it 
for an eternity, his feet making 
clicking sounds on the steel floor 
as he sped through doors and hur- 
riedly closed them after him. He 
was in a tunnel of steel — a tunnel 
divided into three short compart- 
ments containing large crates and 
pieces of machinery to which he 
didn’t give a second glance. 

And then he was out. At last. 
Out, God, from that shell of a 
grave. Out into — oh, God — what 
was he out in? What inconceiv- 
able wrong turn had he made? 
Surely something he had done ex- 
plained what stretched about him 
in every direction. He had gone 
the wrong way, had missed a turn 
somehow, had let himself get 
mixed up — for this — this wasn’t — 

It was all right when they came 
into his home and dragged him 
away without caring how he suf- 
fered — and it was all right when 
they threw him into a dark hole 
and left him like a sodden, ani- 
mal hulk. It was even all right when 
they took away the police station 
and put a morass of steel caverns 
in its place. But, oh God, this 
wasn’t all right! They couldn’t take 
away the world from under his 
feet! 

T he sky was an inferno of 
white flame dominated by a 



sun that lashed the ground, in a 
solid sheet of light. Thick plouds 
bunched everywhere, yet the vast 
expanse was a blinding mirror. 
The ground beneath him was a 
barren waste. No soil lay there, 
only a pitted plane of dust that 
rose to choke him as he stumbled 
about in fear. Jagged pinnacles of 
rock rose all around him, some as 
tall as buildings, other so small he 
could step over them. Heat waves 
made the space in front of him 
dance crazily. 

He saw movement some dis- 
tance away against the high, ugly 
horizon. He went that way, his 
heart slamming against his ribs in 
powerful thumps. As he walked 
he prayed that it was Earth he trod, 
some great and unexplored des- 
ert hidden for eternities from the 
sight and mind of man, some for- 
gotten pit where the laws of na- 
ture followed their own strange 
patterns and had no part with nor- 
malcy. But he knew this was no 
abnormal piece of Earth. It was 
the wrecked surface of another 
world, some other planet, some 
strange and terrifying place he 
had never seen. 

Now he could see figures moving 
in the distance and he quickened 
his pace, for they looked like men. 
Hope reared within him and bat- 
tled his fear that he was alone on an 
alien planet with two madmen: 



SHELTERING DREAM 



145 




A great valley had been slashed 
out of the planet’s body, a valley 
deep enough to accommodate a 
vast complexity of machinery. 
The long slope was terraced with 
deep shelves forming a gigantic 
stairway that descended into a 
pit. Great shovels scooped up tons 
of blasted rock and dumped them 
into a line of open cars that rolled 
on steel tracks out of a shallow lip 
of the valley. The tracks dipped 
across a clear area, where they dis- 
appeared into the jagged rocks. 

Crews labored at the mouth of a 
deep shaft in the pit, guiding a pul- 
ley that drew buckets from within 
the planet and carried them swift- 
ly toward and into an open, 
domed, steel structure rearing at 
the valley’s edge. 

Other crews worked above the 
valley with large sluices that fil- 
tered samples of rock into a fun- 
nel-shaped container. These were 
the laborers Duncan had spied 
from the distance and as he rushed 
toward them his lips formed words 
of greeting. He was no more than 
twenty feet away from the nearest 
one when he stopped running. The 
greeting froze on his lips and he 
stood staring in disbelief at the 
man who wasn’t a man at all. 

Not one of the figures was hu- 
man. They were insects — giant, 
agile, antlike creatures that 
moved much faster than humans 



and possessed strength enough to 
lift and manipulate buckets that 
must have contained a quarter- 
ton of ore. 

They worked with silent preci- 
sion and, as Duncan took a falter- 
ing step toward them, they turned 
to give him a glance and then went 
on with their work. 

Their bodies were a shiny brown 
series of hairy bubbles, tier upon 
tier forming two legs, a torso, two 
arms with three flexible digits for 
hands and a large, knobby head. 
They had two bulging eyes that 
glistened like dark liquid. A small 
hole the size of a quarter was situ- 
ated beneath the eyes. 

He didn’t see a single human 
being. The crews in the valley, the 
workers above it, the occasional 
laborers who moved in and out of 
the domed structure were ants, 
every one. 

For long minutes he let this fact 
be absorbed by his brain. New fear 
stole into his mind like fog prowl- 
ing through forbidden corners, a 
nameless dread that soaked into 
him like cold water. 

H e started toward the 
nearest creatures, who were 
watching a stream of dirty water 
gush down a sluice. His fear made 
him clumsy and he didn’t see the 
mound of ore until he had fallen 
over it. He sprawled on his back.

IF 




staring up into the featureless 
face of one of the insects, who bent 
over him. 

“You have fallen,” it said in a 
deep monotone. “I will help you 
up and we will both check you care- 
fully for damage.” 

The hands that took him and put 
him on his feet were hard and pow- 
erful, A small green circular 
plate was imbedded in the middle 
of the ant’s thick, horny chest. 
Stamped upon it were the letters, 
ABT. The two bulging eyes looked 
down at his legs, then traveled 
slowly upward to rivet on his 
chest. 

“Your identity tag is gone,” in- 
toned the ant. 

Duncan tore himself free and 
began to back away. 

“You’re a bug,” he whispered in 
fright. “You don’t know any- 
thing.” All at once he was shout- 
ing. “You don’t know anything!” 

“Are you really there?” asked 
the ant. 

“A stupid, brainless collection 
of instincts,” Duncan rasped, 
slipping and sliding on the treach- 
erous ground. The ant took a step 
toward him and he cried, “Get 
away from me!” 

“You have no identity,” said 
the creature. “There is no such en- 
tity as a selfless being in a ra- 
tional order. A man ought to be 
notified.” 



“I’m a man,” whimpered Diin- 
can. 

“You are nothing. I do not 
comprehend why you appear to 
be standing there.” 

A second ant suddenly stepped 
between them. Its eyes surveyed 
ABT and then whipped about to fo- 
cus on Duncan. The plate on its 
chest bore the letters, NN. 

“This is a lost one,” it said, 
pointing a digit at Duncan. “Let 
him alone. Do not look at him. Do 
not think of him. He is lost.” 

ABT nodded slowly. “I com- 
prehend. Yes, you are right. He is 
lost.” 

Duncan stumbled away and hid 
behind a thin stalk of rock. The 
two ants stared after him for a few 
moments, then went back to the 
sluice. 

He collapsed onto his back. He 
looked at the blinding sun. There 
was nothing in the sky but the 
white glare that seemed to be 
everywhere, reaching into his 
brain, illuminating his thoughts. 
Unbidden, the knowledge came. 
The sun looked like this because 
the atmosphere was different 
from that of Earth’s. 

His chest moved up and down, 
drawing in lungfuls of fresh air. 
No. This was part of the dream and 
not reality. He was the dream. 
Everything was reality but him- 
self.

He wanted to believe it, desper- 
ately wanted to, and then he even 
gave up this lie. He was real and so 
was the incredible planet on 
which he lay, and these two facts 
added together meant that 
either he was capable of breath- 
ing where there was no oxygen to 
breathe or he was breathing sub- 
stances poisonous to human be- 
ings. 

But he was of Earth, an Earth- 
man, with a white house and a wife 
named Nan who had brown hair 
and soft skin. The children would 
resemble her when they were 
born. Or had they already been 
born? The sun burned his brain so 
that he couldn’t remember. He 
lowered his head to the sterile 
ground and closed his eyes. 

I T TOOK him a long time to re- 
trace his steps back into the 
tunnel. He stumbled as if blind, 
crashing headlong into great 
scarred dunes, falling into empty 
gullies and painfully hauling 
himself out. 

He closed all the doors behind 
him. 

Rand and Deevers had hauled 
Stoneface from the cell and laid 
him in a corner of their living 
quarters. Duncan stood looking at 
what he had believed was a human 
being. He had thought he was 
knocking out a man. What he had 

148 



done was destroy a giant ant. His 
fists had crushed the spindly neck 
and nearly severed the head. The 
tangle of bloody loops and spongy 
gray matter bulged from the skull. 
The green chest tag with the letters 
NN lay on the floor like an eye that 
mocked him. 

Deevers had whirled as he came 
in and scuttled to the far side of 
the table. He sat down, his eyes 
hard and wary. 

Rand was standing in the mid- 
dle of the room, his hands behind 
his back. He stared intently at the 
floor, as though he were unable or 
unwilling to look at anything 
else. 

With shuffling steps Duncan 
moved until he stood directly in 
front of Rand. He fought to keep 
his gaze steady but as the man 
raised his head he found his own 
drooping until his chin touched 
his chest. He felt sweat forming on 
his back and his mind cringed as he 
waited for the words that would 
condemn him to an insane nonen- 
tity. 

He still wasn’t prepared for 
them when they came. They were 
whips that lashed his body with 
steel tips, driving him into a dark 
tunnel where he cowered in ter- 
ror. Without looking at Rand he 
sought for the lie in the man’s tone, 
the subtle slyness that would 
prove this thing a hoax, a fraud, an 



IF 




attempt to destroy his reality 
for some obscure purpose. 

There was no mockery in Rand’s 
voice, no evidence of fraud. He 
spoke evenly and without anger, 
frankly and cruelly, and only the 
queer little breathing gasps he 
took between sentences betrayed 
his awareness of the pain he was 
causing. 

“Deevers and I hold control- 
ling interests in a company on 
Earth called the DNA Laborato- 
ry. We make living organisms to 
labor on planets hostile to men. 
Our major production concerns 
a large insectlike creature whose 
job it is to mine metals unavail- 
able on Earth on other worlds. 
The ‘elements in all organisms 
are the same. Only the propor- 
tions vary. An organism grows if 
new matter accumulates faster 
than the old matter breaks down. 
Maturity is reached when mat- 
ter-building takes place at the 
same rate as the old matter disin- 
tegrates. What we do is hold off 
this last process until our pro- 
ducts arrive at a satisfactory 
size. 

“Our ‘insects’ come in three 
classifications — three types con- 
ditioned and trained for three spe- 
cific jobs. The DKN and ABT 
types operate the sluices and mine 
the pits. Our two NN types are 
programed to monitor the oth- 



ers, to see that nothing goes 
wrong. Two years ago one of the 
AST’s went insane. When Dee- 
vers and I arrived we found that 
ABT thought he was a man. We 
spent two years trying to find out 
what made him and several sub- 
sequent insects psychotic. Now 
we know, thanks to you. 

“Our creatures are grown from 
a small portion of life-material, 
the patterns of development 
carefully manipulated so that 
the nervous system and relevant 
muscular units will be compati- 
ble with the brain that is con- 
structed separately. As the ‘in- 
sect’ grows it is chemically con- 
ditioned to survive in various types 
of environments. The carbohy- 
drates, fats and proteins consti- 
tuting the brain are designed in 
such a way that they reproduce a 
human brain, not just a reasonable 
facsimile but an exact duplication 
of the brain of a man who once 
lived. Who the man was whose 
brain we used as a model doesn’t 
mattbr. What does matter is that 
we’ve created something we don’t 
understand. Deevers and I wanted 
time to test our new products 
thoroughly before they were 
brought here, but the government 
needed our ‘insects’ and pressured 
us into giving up that part of our 
program. We consented because 
we had no reason to suspect our 



SHELTERING DREAM 



149 




‘insects’ knew anything other than 
what they had been taught. The 
peculiar thing is, we’re pretty cer- 
tain those creatures working out 
there dont know anything else. 

“But you do and the others like 
you did. A few hours ago you lost 
your identity tag. Maybe it was 
snagged by one of the pulley hooks 
that draw buckets to the sluices. 
However it was lost, you found 
yourself without an identity. 
Your brain rejected the concept 
of nonentity and fashioned you 
a new self. We don’t know how or 
why this happened. We don’t 
know how you could acquire 
memories of Earth and human 
life and culture when nobody 
taught them to you, but we know 
that you have. 

“I’d like to stop this whole busi- 
ness right now. 1 want a year to 
study my products, throw every 
psychological test in the book at 
them, find out just what it is I’ve 
made, whether I’ve made a crea- 
ture satisfied to do its work as I 
intended or an alien monstrosity 
condemned to misery. But they 
won’t give me that year. The 
government says no. The ‘insects’ 
will be used to produce what Earth 
needs regardless' of my objec- 
tions. So there’s only one thing I 
can do — and I hope to God it’s the 
right thing and not just a minor in- 
terference that will aggravate 

150 



the situation. From now on the 
workers will be made without any 
real identity. They won’t be 
trained to self-awareness in the 
sense that there’s any significance 
attached to it. Their letter types 
will be attached under the loop be- 
tween their thorax and pelvis and 
they’ll know nothing about it. I 
hope it works. I hope that if they 
have no identities — if they aren’t 
taught that there is such a thing as 
real self — they won’t be able to 
lose them. 

“That’s all I can do. I can’t think 
of anything else at the moment.’’ 

¥JAND stopped speaking. He 
raised a hand and covered his 
eyes as if he were trying to block 
off some appalling view. His fin- 
gers dug savagely into his eyes 
and his shoulders slumped. 

Duncan lifted one of his own 
hands and stared at it. He could see 
the creases in his palm, the dark 
hair above the knuckles oh its 
back. He felt his heart pumping 
blood through his body. The 
dream — if the dimension of un- 
reality into which his mind had 
plunged could be called a. 
dream — wouldn’t go away. His 
stomach lurched and he clamped 
his lips tightly. 

He finally raised his head and 
looked at Rand. 



IF 




“What happened to the oth- 
ers?” 

“They wanted to die.” 

A voice whispered, “And so do 
I — ” and Duncan realized it was 
his own. 

“We have an Atomizer in the 
domed building by the valley,” 
Rand said through white lips. “We 
use it to destroy the residue of 
rock collected from the last stages 
of our mining.” 

. Residue of rock. But to die as 
such would be to have lived not at 
all. And Duncan had lived. For the 
past hours he had lived. And so his 
death ought to have reason in it. 
But what reason was there for 
him? 

He searched his memories 
and fastened upon one. Men once 
were put to death for crimes. And 
he was guilty of the crime of de- 
ception. He had pretended that he 
sprang from the loins of Man. This 
was a lie. His birth had been an as- 
sembly-line production, his con- 
ception accomplished within an 
insentient piece of laboratory 
equipment. He believed that 
Earth was his home, even as the 
earthworm’s home is in her soil. 
This, too, was a lie. He had no 
home for the word connoted a 
place of growth, warmth and com- 
passion, not an alien island called 
Venus where nothing grew but 
time, where warmth was measured 



in the destructive holocaust of a 
blast furnace and where compas- 
sion was a cancerous spread in a 
jumble of DNA. 

He was guilty. His sen- 
tence — death. 

“I’m ready,” he said. 

Rand looked at him steadily. 
“I want to go with you.” 

Duncan hesitated. 

“I know you’re still in the 
dream,” said Rand. “You can’t go 
alone.” 

Duncan tried to speak, but all he 
could do was nod. 

Rand took one of the weird suits 
from the wall hook and began to 
put it on. 

Duncan watched. 

Deevers sat at the table, re- 
laxed now as he watched a trail of 
cigarette smoke climb toward 
the ceiling. As Duncan started to- 
ward him his head jerked around 
and his thin cheeks went hollow. 

“You and I have something in 
common,” Duncan said. “We’re 
both lacking in humanness.” 

Deevers’ mouth drew into a sul- 
len line. His face darkened. He 
started to say something, then 
suddenly clamped his lips shut 
and turned his face away. 

Rand led the way out to the sec- 
ond compartment, where he 
wheeled a small open car into the 
corridor. He and Duncan 
stepped into it, Rand behind the 



SHELTERING DREAM 



151 




wheel. The car moved down the 
corridor until the last steel door 
slid shut behind them. 

Out in the open the car plowed 
effortlessly across gullies and 
between jutting rocks, carrying 
the two toward the valley and the 
domed building. 

The sun was harsh and merci- 
less. To Duncan it became a soft 
yellow orb that made him blink his 
eyes. The ground was rough and 
porous beneath them. He imag- 
ined that he saw grass swaying in 
the wind, watched a rabbit dart 
from its burrow and sniff at the air 
for a moment before it lunged in- 
to a thicket. 

Rand took him into the build- 
ing past the fiery furnaces that he 
didn’t remember, along a twist- 
ing corridor that led into a blind- 
ingly hot room where yellow gold 
leaped down a narrow sluice and 
splattered into small molds that 
rolled away on steel tracks. 

The Atomizer was taller than 
a man and twice as wide^It was a 
box of metal with a transparent 
door. When Duncan looked into 
it he saw the air within shimmer 
as desert air shimmers beneath 
the sun. 

Rand had him by the arm. 

“Can you hear me?” he asked, 
his face pale behind the visor, the 
hand on Duncan’s arm trembling. 

Duncan nodded. 



“You only have to step inside 
and close the door.” 

He took a step toward the box. 

Rand held him fast. “Let the 
dream go! What good has it done 
you? You can’t go like this.” 

Duncan knew that if he were a 
man on Earth condemned to die it 
could happen the same way. 
Someone might come and say. Let 
me give you something. It*s per- 
fectly all right, the law allows it. 
It will make your suffering easier 
to bear. You wont know where 
you are. You wont even know who 
you are . 

No... 

As he stepped through the door 
he was looking at a tiny splash of 
light that might have been made by 
the sum 

He closed the door with his own 
hand. 

He saw Rand’s lips forming the 
soundless words, “Goodbye, 
DKN.” 

The dream sheltered him, reared 
invincibly between him and the 
specter of an ‘insect’ self. In his 
mind he cried, / am a man! and his 
reality was victorious over the 
other reality. The destructive 
forces that streamed through the 
atoms of his tough, leathery body 
penetrated the sensitive softness 
of a human being, and his jour- 
ney into oblivion was painful 
and terrible. As he desired. •

B y now most readers of 
^ science fiction must have 
learned that John W. Campbell 
died on July 11, 1971. The loss to 
the field cannot be measured. Dur- 
ing thirty-four years as an editor 
he discovered and developed most 
of today’s top writers and his ideas 
of what science fiction should be 
were largely responsible for its 
evolution into an accepted cate- 
gory of book publishing. 

Because of his importance as an 
editor, however, his contributions 
as a writer are too often over- 
looked. Most of his works are not 
currently available in book 
form — so this time let’s dwell 
briefly on books that are not on the 
stands, though they should be. 

Campbell must really be con- 
sidered as two writers, both suf- 
ficiently major to merit lasting at- 
tention. Under his own name, his 



stories appeared from 1930 
through 1937. These featured 
heavy science — in them the limits 
of man’s knowledge and 
achievements were stretched well 
beyond other writers’ limitations. 
The wonder of science and the 
power of technology were more 
important in them than style, 
mood or characterization. They 
were never meant to be literary 
achievements — but as space opera 
they were breathtaking. To my 
taste, they were better than the 
work of E.E. Smith, whose books 
are still available. 

Under the byline of Don A. 
Stuart, from 1934 until 1939, 
Campbell established himself as 
an entirely different writer. He 
was the first man to write consis- 
tently the type of fiction we now 
call modern and he did it so well 
that his stories still win a high place 



154 




in any list of the best of all time. 

He was preeminent in two fields. 
Yet today I cannot find a single 
volume of his work in print, though 
some of the stories are available in 
several top anthologies. 

The trouble seems to be that 
Campbell wrote before major book 
publishers had discovered science 
fiction and only “fan” publishers 
were giving out contracts. Most of 
his books were printed at least 
twenty years ago. Now, since they 
have been in book form, the hard- 
cover houses won’t reprint them 
and the softcover people don’t 
pick them up because they aren’t 
in hard covers or because their 
original sales were — neces- 
sarily — small. If that would seem 
to indicate that most publishers 
remain ignorant of the field and 
its potentials, the implication is 
purely deliberate. 

The Stuart stories were usually 
short, suitable only for collections, 
with the exception of a single short 
novel entitled The Elder Gods. This 
came out as half of a book from 
one of the “fan” houses. It is a fine 
sword-and-sorcery novel, having 
some of the magic of A. Merritt 
but a lot more logic in its de- 
velopment than much of Merritt’s 
work. It should have been re- 
printed often, but I can find no evi- 
dence that it is to appear again. Of 
the two collections once issued. 
Who Goes There? was brought out 
in soft covers nearly twenty years 



ago, but has not been reissued. I 
understand from Scott Meredith, 
Campbell’s agent, that the second 
collection. Cloak of Aesir, will 
appear in soft covers shortly. If 
you find it on your stands — buy it 
at once. It may be your only chance 
to get a fair sampling of Camp- 
bell’s writing. 

Certainly there seem to be no 
plans to issue any of the work done 
under Campbell’s own name. 
These were once fairly well repre- 
sented in book form, but I can now 
find none in print. The almost 
legendary Arcot-Wade-and-Morey 
stories were brought out by Ace as 
The Black Star Passes and Islands 
of Space, which concludes with 
perhaps the wildest development 
of space opera ever imagined. Ace 
also published The Mightiest 
Machine, though not its sequel. 
The Incredible Planet. Other 
Campbell novels never appeared 
in book form. One of these was 
originally published in a mag- 
azine under a different title for 
each installment, but is remem- 
bered as either The Mother World 
or Conquest of the Planets. I con- 
sider it one of the best of the hard- 
science novels — it was based on 
Dirac’s theories in which space and 
matter are treated as different 
states of the same thing, and ca- 
pable of giving men powers beside 
which psi would be kindergarten 
stuff. 

It seems highly peculiar that one 
of the best and most influential 



READING ROOM 



155 




writers of science fiction should 
have no books currently on the 
stands and only one promised for 
the future. It is especially strange 
when one considers the number of 
books that are available but 
should not be! 

O NE of these latter, incidental- 
ly, is The Sea Is Boiling Hot, 
by George Bamber (Ace, IH). Su- 
perficially, from the dust jacket, 
this should be a timely story of the 
struggle against pollution at a 
time when man can exist only in 
enclosed cities. But the story be- 
gins with the “hero” Heron know- 
ing that he has the answer to Ihe 
problem; hence, there is no longer 
any plot after about page 24. Then 
we learn at once that Heron has no 
intention of revealing this se- 
cret: “I know but I won’t tell.” We 
now have a coy fool as our main 
character. “Science” is intro- 
duced when the author, who ap- 
parently never heard of oxida- 
tion and reduction, suggests that 
the opposite of “combustion” 
must be given a new term, “im- 
bustion.” (Doesn’t know much 
about language, either, it seems.) 
We fiddle around with assorted 
sex scenes at a totally unemo- 
tional level and then get into a 
chase scene, to wind up with Heron 
giving up the big secret at the end, 
for no better reason than he had 
at the beginning. At this point 
boredom grows climactic. I real- 
ly can’t believe that publishers 



are that hard up for material! 

There is one book, however, that 
is both available and excellent in 
every way. This is the softcover 
edition of what may be the best 
anthology of science fiction ever 
put together. At a price of $1.50, 
Science Fiction Hall of Fame, 
edited by Robert Silverberg 
(Avon), is a book that should be 
bought at once by anyone who 
doesn’t have the hardcover ver- 
sion. I considered it a bargain at 
more than five times the price, so 
it’s the best buy in science fiction 
now. 

I hope that this volume will re- 
main in print for at least another 
decade, since it makes the best 
one-volume introduction to sci- 
ence fiction I have found. But in 
case it suffers the usual fate of 
giving place to something new 
and not as good after a short time. 
I’d advise getting more than one 
copy. At this price you can afford 
it — and owning a spare is better 
than being afraid to lend your sole 
copy. 

As usual, of course, most books 
lie somewhere between the above 
two extremes. One to which I have 
been looking forward is the se- 
quel to The Warlock in Spite of 
Himself from which I derived 
more pure fun than from almost 
any other novel last year. King 
Kobold, by Christopher Stash- 
eff (Ace, 75<), is not up to the high 
level of the former book, I’m sor- 
ry to say, but I would have en-

IF 




joyed it moderately well if I 
hadn’t expected too much. Mostly 
it seems lacking the spontaneity 
of its predecessor. 

This time. Rod Gallowglass, the 
High Warlock, is somehow more 
a figurehead than he was in the 
earlier work. He is less personal- 
ly involved — he now holds an of- 
ficial position where his job de- 
mands he handle things, and the 
pressures on him are much weak- 
er. Too, the reader is shown too 
many events that are outside the 
protagonist’s ken. This puts one 
in the position of frequently 
knowing more about the story 
than he does and further saps in- 
terest. 

The inventions in the current vol- 
ume seem inferior to those in the 
previous novel. Nothing in this 
book equals the wonderfully 
zany ghosts and their king. No 
character stands out as did the 
loyal-disloyal aide and enemy 
we met before. Even the robot 
horse does nothing but sink into 
the background — and Gramarye 
becomes the setting for just an- 
other future sword and sorcery 
struggle. 

The menace this time around is 
not internal to Gramarye or to 
Rod’s lack of knowledge. We have 
a Menace — a typically ugly, 
brutish menace, apparently. 
Creatures like Neanderthal men 
(as pictured in too many stories) 
are being led against the king and 
Rod is summoned to handle 



them. Okay, turns out that the rea- 
sons for the invasion aren’t quite 
what we might expect; but they are 
not that much of a surprise, either. 

There are some excellent touch- 
es, such as the relationship of an 
old witch and a hermit wizard 
and their corporeal but unborn 
son. But somehow, the whole mat- 
ter of the son becomes contrived 
and lackluster when he has to be 
fitted into the interplanetary or- 
ganization to which Rod belongs. 

Stasheff writes well and some of 
his science fiction and fantasy 
combine smoothly. But this book 
seems overplotted and under- 
done — too routine for the writer’s 
obvious talents. I’d give it a luke- 
warm recommendation — but it’s 
worth reading if you don’t expect 
too much of the evening spent with 
it. And I still think Stasheff is go- 
ing to make a reputation as a 
fine writer. 

A nother mild disappoint- 
^ ment is The Flying Sorcerers, 
by David Gerrold and Larry 
Niven (Ballantine, 950). Niven 
has become a major writer and I 
expect Gerrold to establish him- 
self as top rank shortly. But in this 
book, it seems to me, they’ve tak- 
en too many bites from a single 
pie. 

The book falls into two sections. 
The first, which fits the title, deals 
with a local sorcerer who finds his 
territory invaded by a human 
scientist — a fellow sorcerer 



READING ROOM 



157 




dealing in other magic, from his 
view. Shoogar does what any hon- 
est sorcerer must 'do — he resorts 
to every dishonest trick in his 
book. And the war between Shoo- 
gar and “Purple,” the human, is a 
lovely war indeed. This takes up 
the first half of the book, and it is 
delightful. 

But then we find that the war 
isn’t over, exactly. Purple turns 
up again and this time he has been 
stranded — his ferry ship down to 
the planet is destroyed and his 
new location is one from which he 
cannot make radio contact with 
the main ship. His object is to get 
the primitive natives, half under 
Shoogar’s control, to build him a 
balloon and let him fly to where 
the ship can be ordered down. 

There’s a good deal of ingen- 
ious work in this half, also. But it 
is no longer a light and comic 
book. Shoogar is shoved into the 
background, where he can only 
wander around muttering dark- 
ly and planning pretty revenge. 
From a clever and resourceful 
man who took on a power bigger 
than himself — and won — he be- 
comes only a stupid nuisance 
who cannot understand what 
goes on. 

The basic story of a stranded 
Earthman who has to turn a prim- 
itive tribe into a post-industrial- 
revolution people to get them to 
build what he needs is a good situ- 
ation; and the effects on the 
primitives are well conceived, as 



is the technology developed. 

But the two halves just don’t 
make a whole. The second half is 
made less interesting by the pres- 
ence of Shoogar and the first half 
is made somewhat less pointed 
when we realize how little the 
sorcerer deserved all the cheer- 
ing we were doing for him. It is 
quite impossible now to believe 
that this pitiful, ignorant war- 
lock could have accomplished 
what we had to accept before 
from him. 

It’s not at all a bad book — but it 
isn’t all a good one. The first half, 
to the triumph of Shoogar, is well 
worth reading. But the book 
should then be put aside for a few 
months before trying the second 
half. 

There’s also a minor complaint 
I have with the book. Niven and 
Gerrold have loaded it with names 
slightly distorted from those of 
science-fiction writers and fans. 
Sure, it’s a slightly interesting 
guessing game decoding them. 
But it soon ceases to be funny and 
it distracts from following the 
story and makes everything too 
much of a put-on. This is basical- 
ly an amateur trick; it should be 
reserved for fanzines, not used in 
professional work. 

A somewhat similar fault mars 
Jack of Shadows, by Roger 
Zelazny (Walker, $5.95). Through 
half of the book. Jack is a sort of

world, where his dominion and 
power lie in the shadows of the 
land between light-side and dark- 
side. 

This world might be one of those 
constructed by men such as the 
protagonist of Isle of the Dead. 
It has to be a construct, since it is 
carefully arranged to have no ro- 
tation of day and night; yet the 
bright side is shielded against too 
much heat and the dark is pro- 
vided with heat. It has its own 
“gods,” or rulers, with extraor- 
dinary powers; and one of their 
functions is to maintain the vari- 
ous balances on the world, how- 
ever much they feud otherwise. 

The first half of the book carries 
Jack to the cold area where magic 
rules — and since his powers in- 
volve rnagic, this is all right. But 
then he moves to the lighted 
area — an area singularly simi- 
lar to today’s Earth and hence 
rather uninteresting. There he 
acquires a knowledge of science, 
goes back to defeat his enemies 
with his new powers and becomes 
master, only to find he has to per- 
form his balancing act alone — if 
he can — by rather routine travels 
into a computer complex, lack- 
ing the magic to which we’ve be- 
come accustomed. 

The first part is minor Zelazny, 
quite enjoyable. The second half 
breaks away, becomes rather 
grim and ugly — and loses all the 
glamor it needs to be anything 
but dull. 



In the end, because we don’t 
learn enough about Jack and his 
origins, the whole thing seems 
rather pointless. Wait for the 
softcover version; it’s certainly 
not worth Walker’s price. 



F inally we come to John 
Norman. His Raiders of Got 
(Ballantine, 950) is the sixth in 
the series. I find myself unable to 
resist the Gor novels, despite the 
irritation I usually feel when 
reading them. (Except for the 
third, where I found the Priest- 
Kings excellently handled.) 
Norman seems capable of mak- 
ing every mistake a writer can 
make. 

Yet he is also the only writer to- 
day who seems able to capture any 
of the feeling I used to find in the 
Martian stories of Edgar Rice 
Burroughs. And while my taste 
may still be adolescent in this, I 
seem to find a great many who 
agree and who also turn to the Gor 
novels — they may be gaffe, but 
they’re the only game of that sort 
in town. And on all-over balance, 
they’ve captured more of the ro- 
mance and appeal of the old Bar- 
soom novels than anyone else has 
been able to develop. __ 

This time Norman has made al- 
most none of the mistakes of his 
last two books. He has largely got- 
ten off his adolescent sex kick 
where he was out establishing 
Men’s Lib by proving, that every

woman wants to be a slave and 
that nothing captures the female 
heart like a good beating. And he 
hasn’t tricked up his method of 
telling the story as he did in the 
last — he tells it straight this time 
and there are no lapses that have 
to be covered by flashbacks 
where the real action should be 
shown. Obviously he can learn by 
experience. 

But he has fallen into another 
error — less annoying, yet some-, 
how less fascinating. He seems 
to have lost purpose as a result of 
trying a rather commendable 
experiment. Most of his books 
lately have been centered on the 
mystery of alien invaders and 
Cabot’s search to help the Priest- 
Kings defeat them. This book 
starts that way, but then gets side- 
tracked. 

Apparently, Norman decided 
that he was tired of a hero who was 
all strong and brave and resolute. 
He makes Cabot demonstrate a 
moment of surrender and cow- 
ardice, followed by self-loath- 
ing — not a bad idea^ in a way, even 
though it seems revolutionary in 
this type of story. 

Unfortunately, perhaps because 
there is no precedent, Cabot 
seems not to know how to go about 
demonstrating a weakness. In- 
stead of seeing himself as having 
been forced into a hopeless situ- 
ation by a concatenation of ir- 
resistible circumstances, Cab- 
ot just suddenly turns coward for 



a moment. The scene isn’t con- 
vincing — its development is too 
quick and too much like other 
cases where he was not afraid. 
Then the book goes glimmering 
off into vaporous self-loathing 
in which Cabot seems to feel that 
since he is now scum of Gor, he 
might as well act as scummily as 
the pirates he joins. 

Trouble is, he really doesn’t act 
thus. He does a few things — as if 
periodically Norman remem- 
bered and threw the events that 
way — out of heroic character, 
but generally he is the same old 
Cabot. And in the end — the au- 
thor’s intent may be excel- 
lent — Cabot’s discovery that any 
man can have moments of weak- 
ness without being less a hero is 
also too sudden, too easy and not 
at all convincing. 

There is a story of romance and 
adventure mixed up in ail this. 
But somehow, once he sees him- 
self as scum, Cabot seems to lose 
all motivation, forget his mission 
for the Priest-Kings and mostly 
drift. The impression I get of the 
story is that it also drifts. It has 
none of the earlier faults, but it al- 
so has none of the earlier drive. 

Still, I recommend it to all Gor 
fans. It has a lot of Norman’s col- 
or, and by getting over his bad 
habits, Norman has put himself 
in a good form to continue the 
series. Anyhow, at 320 pages, 
there is a lot of action and adven- 
ture for the money ! •

DOUGLAS R. MASON 




A s FAR as she could see the 
^forest was still. Quiet. Drugged 
by midday heat that set the hori- 
zon to shimmering. It was a 
stronger sun than the sun of Bro- 
mius and its warmth ran along her 
shoulders and arms like a tangi- 
ble sheath. 

She would miss it. It would not 
be long now before Tregasid 
Three completed its mission to 
the other planets of the system 
and appeared overhead like a 
ruby star to call her back. The cy- 
cle was complete. She and Atan 
had recorded the slow drift of a 
year’s seasons, each more plea- 
sant and agreeable than the last. 
All the data that anybody could 
ever require about the blue-green 
watery planet was methodical- 
ly stored and indexed in the mem- 
ory banks of the computer. 

Ava’s thoughts stopped short. 
“Pleasant,” “agreeable” — those 

were danger words. She was using 
aesthetic judgment again. She 
was being unscientific. It was 
just as well that she had not spoken 
them out loud when Atan was 
around. In his present mood he 
would have had them in the log as 
sure as a gun. 

Where was he anyway? Not 
much more than a hectare on the 
low plateau had been sealed off by 
the force field, but he had a knack 
of losing himself in it. Almost as 



though he were deliberately hid- 
ing from her. 

To some extent that was fine. He 
had turned out to be a poor com- 
panion for the long haul. He 
worked a sixteen-hour day and 
slept through the balance. As a 
professional she could admire 
the quality of the work he was do- 
ing. No other survey team would 
turn in a fuller or better docu- 
mented brief. But he was pro- 
gramed like an android whose 
courtesy tape had been omitted. 

At the foot of the escarpment a 
slow clear river ran silently into 
the lush forest. On the far bank 
was a sandy clearing, a gold ochre 
strip, below viridian foliage 
dotted with asterisks of cobalt 
blue and lemon yellow. 

As she watched, a small family 
party of hominids stepped from 
the leaf screen and walked cau- 
tiously to the water’s edge. Either 
she was getting less critical or 
these were near enough in type to 
herself to be called human. She 
was all set to wave, then stopped. 

Any movement on her part 
would only frighten them off. All 
mobile life forms had taken to 
leaving a wide gap between them- 
selves and the invisble barrier 
that protected the strangers. 

Ava watched the male wade 
thigh deep in the water, splash 
glittering handfuls over his head

and chest and then submerge un- 
til only his head was showing. 
The female was watching the for- 
est, child straddled over one hip. 
She was less heavily furred than 
her partner. Straight black hair 
dropped below shoulder level in 
a smooth cowl, breasts were taut 
and neat. Tiring of watching the 
swimmer, she set the child down 
and walked away toward the tree 
line with a leg action that was fem- 
inine for any hominid culture in 
the galaxy. 

When she returned she held a 
broad leaf across both hands, on it 
a small pyramid of large golden 
berries. 

The bather waded ashore, scat- 
tering diamond droplets, the 
drag of the current emphasized 
in the powerful swing of his mas- 
sive shoulders. At the river’s edge 
he gathered a double handful of 
water and threw it in a shower at 
the other two. 

The distance was too great for 
speech sounds to reach Ava, but 
the mime told her that it went like 
a bomb. The child rolled over and 
over in exaggerated, joyous ter- 
ror and the female put down her 
fruit and ran for the male. 

A wild cheerful tussle in the shal- 
lows followed. 

A va lay back on her flat rock 
^and watched the sky. From ho- 



rizon to horizon it was a clear 
cerulean blue. Beyond it was the 
black night of space and infinite- 
ly far was the cinnamon-tinged 
sky of Bromius. She felt sudden- 
ly more alone than at any time dur- 
ing the mission. 

To Atan the family group at the 
river would consist of savages. 
Barely human. Items to list in his 
log with a total portrait, voice 
prints, biology, life style — all the 
data that described a specimen 
and left out the vital parameters 
that made a living man. The whole 
is greater than the sum of its parts. 

When she looked again they 
were sitting eating the fruit and 
the man’s — yes, he was a 
man — hand was resting comfor- 
tably on the woman’s thigh. 

Ava took off her electrum fili- 
gree headband and let her hair fall 
in a dark mane. Then ^he stood up 
and walked slowly down the slope 
to the river. 

The force field was set some 
meters out from the edge of the wa- 
ter so that Atan could take speci- 
mens of fish for his collection, A 
small inflated power boat he used 
was drawn up on the shingle. 

The child ^aw her first, stopped 
eating and pointed. The woman 
leaped to her feet, picked him up 
and ran for the trees, the man fol- 
lowing more slowly, facing the 
danger, teeth bared. 



THE CASTOFFS 



163 




At the river Ava stopped. Her 
reflection, familiar and unfa- 
miliar, stared back. They had seen 
that creature. Tall, pale-skinned, 
shining metal cloth tabard with 
the double helix of Bromius 
worked in brilliants, long boots 
shining with every finish that 
could be devised to repel all 
known pests that might be harm- 
ful. 

No wonder they had run for the 
bush. She was outside experi- 
ence, a mechanical monster 
with a human head. 

Before she realized what she in- 
tended to do, Ava had zipped down 
the seals of her tabard and lifted it 
over her head, leaving it to stand 
like a decapitated trunk. Then she 
pulled off her boots, stood for a 
'count of five in her maize leotard, 
shrugged, wriggled lithely out of 
St and walked into the water. 

If she had brought her activa- 
tor, she would have switched out 
the field and swum across. As it 
was, she floated in the warm wa- 
ter, jackknifed to the sandy bot- 
tom to look at the plant life and 
came up streaming like a half-tide 
rock to hear her name being 
called. 

“Ava.” 

“Down here.” 

Crotch deep in water she 
watched Atan stride down the 
slope, looking across the riv- 



er — there still was movement in 
the trees. Then he saw her and 
stopped dead. 

His voice came, hard-edged, 
“What do you think you are do- 
ing?” 

The question made her analyze 
her motives. Maybe the answer she 
chose was true. 

“I thought they should see we 
are flesh and blood under all the 
gear. We must look like mechan- 
ical marvels. It’s no wonder they 
won’t come near.” 

“So you thought a strip show 
would bridge the culture gap. Do 
you realize that without the bar- 
rier you might have been carried 
off and forcibly mated. Do you 
want to end up as one of the cows 
in a bull ape’s family group?” 

What had seemed a natural thing 
to do now looked ridiculous in her 
own eyes. Also she was conscious 
that a cuirasse esthetique was not 
cover enough in a dialogue with a 
fully clothed male standing on 
higher ground. 

She decided she hated his guts, 
crossed her arms over her breasts 
and said, matching his tone, 
“There’s no need to go on. I’m not 
stupid. Go away and I’ll dress. 
What do you want me for anyway? 
You seem to be able to manage 
everything single-handed.” 

“Some calculation you should 
check. You are, after all, the math- 



164 



IF 




ematician of the station. I should 
be glad to have a few minutes of 
your attention. Let me remind you 
that our time is running out. The 
spacer could arrive any day.” 

Ava debated whether to scoop 
up a double handful of water and 
throw it at him. Or a rock. But he 
was too far away. Missing would 
ruin it as a gesture. She dropped 
her arms and began to wade ele- 
gantly for the home shore. 

Atan turned on his heel and 
strode up the hill. 

T he main meal of the day was 
taken at 1800 hours local reck- 
oning. At first they had taken time 
over it, talking about the work of 
the day, reminiscing about Brom- 
ius, although there was a partial 
block on that. Deep briefing had 
not only given basic sex responses 
a shrewd knock; it had aimed to 
build in an inhibition of any 
nostalgic longing for their distant 
home planet. Theoretically they 
were proof against the fifth column 
that worked from the inside of 
every head to make bricks of 
unhappiness with or without straw. 

In the early days of the Mission 
Ava had reckoned she had been 
lucky in the raffle. Besides being a 
fantastically good organizer, Atan 
had been a pleasant and witty 
companion. They had gotten 
along fine until he started the 



recluse bit. At the same time he 
had taken to pulling rank and using 
this edgy hectoring tone as though 
he resented her being here at all. 

Currently he was eating a nut 
cutlet simulate and checking over a 
sheaf of notes that represented the 
day’s take. He had not even said he 
liked the omelet and she had spent 
at least ten minutes of her life’s 
finite span working out the 
combination on the dispenser. 

Stung at last to the direct ques- 
tion, she said, “Well, what did you 
make of it?” 

Atan said, “Comprehensive as 
far as it goes, but I’ve only 
scratched the surface. Do you 
realize there could be at least three 
hundred and fifty thousand species 
of plants. Very much more com- 
plex than anything we have on 
Bromius. I’ve used four main 
groups for classification. Al- 
gae, mosses, ferns, seed-bearers. 
That seems to work out for this 
locale and I’d guess it would serve 
for the whole planet since the devi- 
ations in soil and climate are not 
very great. That reminds me— I 
have some specimens to fix before 
they go off. I’d like your help at 
first light. I want to do a final sur- 
vey downriver. Pollen count over a 
measured square kilometer. Set 
up a sampling grid.” 

"" Please set up a sampling grid.” 

“I haven’t time. You do it.” 



THE CASTOFFS

The handiest missile was the wa- 
ter jug and she had it poised to 
throw, but he was already halfway 
across the clearing to the geodesic 
dome that served as a lab. 

She cleared disposable table- 
ware into the destructor and 
watched it dissolve. It looked like 
the only entertainment she was go- 
ing to get. Atan was set for several 
hours, then he would go to bed. 

Ava went to her own roomy cell, 
put on an actualizer tape, switched 
it off and looked out through the 
window. The planet’s sun was 
standing on the horizon like a ver- 
milion disk. It was the time of day 
when there was a sense that any- 
thing could happen. 

She remembered the primitives 
and the sun reminded her of the 
golden fruit they had left on the 
sand. That would be something 
now for Atan’s collection. Edible, 
too. God, it would serve him right 
if she put them on the menu for his 
next meal in spite of the absolute 
prohibition against eating any local 
product. 

Taking a sudden decision she 
strapped on her equipment belt and 
returned to the clearing. A glow 
came from the dome. He was stuck 
at the coal face. No problem. 

When she reached the river bank 
the sun was below the level and 
streamers of cadmium yellow and 
vermilion made a backdrop for the 



forest. She pushed out the 
lightweight dinghy, neutralized the 
power screen and headed for the 
far shore. 

Outside the barrier there was 
more noise — a confused racket like 
a crackle of static, as though the 
leaf curtain covered a frenzy of 
living action. Light levels were 
dropping fast and it took her longer 
to cross than she had expected— 
the current was doing its best to 
sweep the flimsy craft down- 
stream. 

When she hit the beach she had 
to use a hand lamp to search the 
ground. 

Noise cut off as she walked up 
the sand and she felt the menace of 
sudden silence. 

Atan could be right. She was be- 
having like a fool. Any minute 
there could be a rush from the for- 
est and she would be cut off. Atan 
would not even know where to look 
for her. If he wanted to, the self- 
sufficient swine. 

Then she saw what she was look- 
ing for, kneeled down and packed 
seven large hard berries into a 
pouch, using her left hand and 
keeping a roving beam round the 
tree line. 

When it was done she fairly ran 
for the boat, pushed off and spun 
the rheostat into full-drive posi- 
tion, leaving a creamy wake across 
the dark river. 



166 



IF 




Atan took the half beaker of 
reddish juice without comment. Be- 
fore breakfast he had fueled the ex- 
cursion module and was obvious- 
ly anxious to move off. 

She had intended to serve pieces 
of fruit; but when she had cut 
across the tough golden rind she 
had found a reddish pulp and a 
mass of small hard seeds. It had 
been a job for the extractor to 
make a drink of it, acid, sweet, dry- 
ing to the palate but a new and 
pleasant taste. 

As he lifted the glass she almost 
warned him, but a persuasive 
voice in her ear put in its oar. 

He deserves all he gets. Take 
him down a peg. Tell him later. 
After all, it isnt poison. Youve 
tried it. Just wait until he's filling 
out the declaration that there's 
been no breach of biocontamin^ 
ation regs. See how he gets around 
that one. 

Ten minutes later they were over 
tree-top height, clearing the in- 
visible palisade and following the 
broad river. 

A tan swore as he watched 
^ blood well from a five-centi- 
meter gash in the palm of his left 
hand. He dropped the net with its 
still struggling captive. 

“You should have waited,” Ava 
said. “Another minute and the 
nerve shot would have worked for 



sure. Hold it up. I’ll get a suture.” 

She ran the twenty meters to the 
module which was standing on its 
tripod jacks and scanning the area 
like a patient hbund dog. When she 
was two paces away it began to 
bleep a warning, picking up the 
urgency in her head. 

She said, “Shut up you fool, it’s 
me — ” and snatched a medicare 
pack. 

Atan was standing like the statue 
of a demagogue and obediently 
sat across a handy tree trunk for 
attention. Absorbed by the pro- 
fessional angle Ava joined him 
knee to knee and took his hand on 
her lap. Neat economical move- 
ments sterilized the wound and 
ran in a flexible sealing tissue. 
Basic inoculations would take 
care of any alien microbe that 
might have gotten into the blood. 
Though for that matter she ought 
to take a sample smear from the 
creature’s mouth and run it 
through the analyzer. It could just 
be one that nobody had thought 
about. 

Concentrating on the chore, she 
was not watching Atan’s right 
hand. When it homed on the nape 
of her neck and pushed its fingers 
gently up through her hair, she was 
a surprised medic. 

She went still as any stone. Atan 
shuffled along his log cleverly 
getting his knees on the inside

track. The medicare pack sealed 
itself and rolled clear. 

A prudent housekeeper, she tried 
to catch it, but she was held fast. 
The damaged hand, proving that 
she had done a good repair job. 
Joined its partner to clamp her 
head in a firm grip. 

Considering that she had been 
angling for a little personal atten- 
tion for some time, her reaction 
was unreasonable. 

“Atan. No. The codex.” 

To show that he knew all about 
it, he quoted section three from the 
top harshly, as though it had been 
set up to do him a personal injury. 

“‘Also, in addition to the pro- 
hibitions above relating to all phys- 
ical contact with aliens, there is the 
absolute prohibition against un- 
necessary physical contact be- 
tween partners on a mission. Vari- 
ations in radiation level cannot be 
precisely determined; pairing 
bonds established outside the home 
gravisphere could result in mutant 
genes being imported to Bromusian 
stock.’ Do I need to go on?” 

Head still fixed for a close view 
of his sternum, she was ideally 
placed to evaluate the old crack 
that love does not lie in gazing in- 
to a partner’s eyes but in looking 
together in the same direction. 

She remembered it. He had it 
right. It could be his favorite bed- 
time reading. They were consider- 



ing the same text but he sounded 
angry about it. 

Finger pressure swiveled her 
head on its stalk. His face was un- 
expectedly close. Eyes were se- 
rious, but gave the lie to the voice 
print. She was being looked at as 
though she were his apple from 
way back. 

Fighting a rearguard, Ava said, 
“No — ” again. 

Atan said, “I like the shape of 
your mouth when you say that. It’s 
convenient.” 

A gram of practice being worth a 
kilo of theory, he proved his point, 
homing on her lips with the precise 
component orientation that long- 
standing practice as a technical 
expert made second nature. 

Ava’s hands were flat on his 
chest pushing for out. Then the 
steam leaked. Her hands traveled 
up his tabard and locked behind his 
head. If she could have gotten in a 
final crack it might have been — if 
you can’t beat it, join it. 

After two minutes she knew she 
didn’t want to beat it anyway and 
she was thinking unselfishly of 
Atan. As the headman of the 
group, he would have to pick up the 
tab when Tregasid Three made her 
planetfall. There would be the 
routine session on the recall couch 
to check that what was in the mani- 
fest was all there was of action for 
the trip.

IF 




It would be out and about on the 
screen in full color with the psycho 
team having a ball. So far there 
was no real damage. The solid 
achievment of the mission would 
outweigh it. He might get away 
with a blue star entry on his profile 
and a norhinal fine. 

Using a last kick of failing will 
power, she twisted free. 

“Atan, listen to me.” 

“And why not? I haven’t told 
you, but your voice is the rarest 
music. I particularly like the way 
you say Atan with that precise 
palatal tap on the T. Say it again.” 
“Atan!” 

“That’s it. Sends anticipatory 
shivers down my spine.” 

“Atan, I’m sorry.” 

“What do you have to be sorry 
about? Is it that nude bathing bit? 
You’re thinking you triggered off 
all the chemically depressed lecher 
in me. Why do you think I’ve been 
avoiding you these last months? Do 
you know why? I couldn’t trust my- 
self to be near you. If anybody has 
to be sorry, it’s me. But don’t 
worry. There won’t be any prob- 
lem. The record will show that you 
were an unwilling victim. All I 
want from you is a promise that 
when we get back you’ll consider a 
pairing application. God, how 
can you reduce what I feel to legal 
jargon.” 

“Atan, I’m ashamed. You’re 



making me feel ashamed. Please 
listen to me.” 

“Okay. The forest’s ferny floor 
is yours.” 

“Let me go.” 

“Is that necessary?” 

“You might think so when I tell 
you what I did.” 

S TANDING beside the log, a 
meter away, Ava marshaled the 
facts, distracted by her audience’s 
unaffected pleasure in simply 
looking at her. She reckoned that 
getting what you wanted had its 
problems and that it would be a 
fine thing if people could hit the 
mean between extremes of be- 
haviour. Also she recognized that 
she didn’t want to trigger off a re- 
version to the iron man routine^ * 
She moistened her lips with the 
tip of her tongue and said, “Atan.” 
The excursion pod, as if on cue, 
went into spasm with its 'high- 
pitched bleep and Atan swung oft 
his log and was beside her, one 
hand clamped arolind her waist, 
the other sawing around with a 
blaster, hunting a target. 

Nothing extraordinary was 
visible, but the urgent signal went 
on. Something could be lurking on 
the far side of the pod, hidden by its 
petal antennae. 

He said, “Wait,” and took two 
steps. A net of fine sticky creeper 
dropped silently from the foliage

overhead and turned him into a 
cocoon. 

Ava had a count of five to re- 
flect that the book had a point. 
Personal involvement came at the 
expense of prudence. If A tan had 
not been distracted they would 
have been back on board with their 
specimen and with mega power un- 
der their thumb. 

Her own cowl dropped neatly 
over her head and the set filled with 
extras as hominid types whipped 
out of the wookwork on all sides. 

There are two sides to every sit- 
uation. All the newcomers looked 
pleased. Enormous jaws were 
hinged open in grins that bared 
large yellow teeth. Flat noses were 
wrinkled with delight. 

' One massive male, feet astride, 
toes turned in, long arms hanging 
almost to his knees was jigging up 
and down as though on hydraulic 
jacks’ 

For all their technical know- 
how, Atan and she had fallen for a 
stone-age ploy. Maybe because 
they had been sidetracked by a 
basic drive that had a stone-age 
simplicity. It was humiliating to 
believe that the book could be 
right all along. There was a moral 
in that somewhere, but there was 
no time to track it to its hole. The 
group had stopped its celebration 
dance and had closed in. 

They were not the same species 



as the family group she had 
watched across the river. These 
were hairier and more heavily 
built. One step farther back in the 
evolutionary chain or even 
coming up on a different track al- 
together. 

Two males with hand axes — 
clumsy stones with one face flaked 
into a cutting edge — began work- 
ing on her net. The links parted. 
One of them took her in a compre- 
hensive grip so that she could not 
move her hands. His pungent body 
scent assaulted her nostrils. 

Instinct had told their captors 
that the alien’s equipment was dan- 
gerous and they systematically 
peeled away her gear as though 
husking a nut. 

The leotard gave a little trouble, 
but even before it was sliced away 
it was clear that they had gotten, 
themselves a surprise package. 
She had larger charms than Atan 
and everybody wanted to touch. 

Passing around the inquisitive 
circle, a bewildered lay figure, she 
was only three meters from Atan 
when the excursion pod made a 
solo and strictly unrepeatable en- 
try into the score. 

Curiosity, evolution’s handmaid, 
had moved a buck male to squeeze 
himself in the pilot’s seat and rum- 
mage around with the switchgear. 
To further his research he had rip- 
ped away the hood of the instru-

IF 




ment cluster and raveled out a 
bundle of color-coded leads. 

Twisting them in a cat’s cradle 
and sawing them against a sharp 
edge to cut them free, he beat the 
maker’s safety factor and brought 
the built-in destructor mechanism 
into circuit. 

Bleeps accelerated to prestis- 
simo. 

There was a brilliant flash that 
froze the action into a still and a 
deep resonance that shook the 
floor. The excursion pod made its 
last trip in fist-sized gobbets that 
flew around the grove like shrap- 
nel, with the head of the tribe’s 
first scientist, sliced at the neck by 
a flailing •strut, opting for vertical 
take-off, still set in a happy grin of 
achievement. 



A TAN was seconds ahead of 
^the game. The rising tempo of 
the bleeps from the pod had alerted 
him to the chance on the way. As 
the flash lit the grove and the hands 
gripping him opened in reaction, 
he was already hurling himself 
sideways toward Ava. He 
knocked her off her uneasy bal- 
ance and was arched over her, 
shielding her with his body as the 
trash surged around the company. 
Before the shock wave had passed 
he was hauling her to her feet and 
making for the trees. 



The going was rough on two 
sophisticates used to having a bet- 
ter power/weight ratio than any- 
thing in the neighborhood. But 
Atan kept going for a kilometer 
before he hauled her to a stop in a 
flowering shrub. 

Chest heaving prettily, Ava 
opened her mouth to speak and got 
a hand clamped over it. Eyes roll- 
ing with emotion she stuck it out 
for half a minute and finally took 
a bite. 

Atan said, “What do you want 
to do that for?” 

“I have to breathe.” 

“Oh. Oh, well. It doesn’t mat- 
ter — they seem to have packed it 
in.” 

It was true. Forest noises, after 
a digestive lull w^re notching up to 
full strength, but threre^ was. no. 
sound of beaters breaking through 
the undergrowth. 

Atan said, “That was. close. We 
shouldn’t hang around. You 
okay?” 

“That’s relative. Compared to 
when?” 

“Discounting wear and tear, you 
look fine. Exercise brings color to 
that alabaster skin.” 

Ava reckoned that the human 
situation was fraught with caprice. 
From being a human clam, Atan 
had switched to being an. unsea- 
sonable talker. Also she was be- 
ing gotten at by a pushy twig. 



THE CASTOFFS 



171 




“There could be others. 
Shouldn’t we get on?” 

“Ruthless female logic at its 
best. Allow me,” 

Before she could say anything he 
had picked her up and lifted her 
clear to open ground. 

Contact reminded her that she 
still had a confession to make. 

“Atan I was telling you. It’s all 
my fault.” 

“Save it. Tell me tonight and I’ll 
fix a suitable background of erotic 
music. Now I’m not too clear 
about the direction. I reckon we 
should find the river and follow the 
bank. That way we can’t miss.” 

He was right. But it took longer 
than either of them had believed 
possible. When they stumbled 
hand in hand around the last bend, 
^wading in half a meter of water on 
the uneven river bed as a poor al- 
ternative to thigh deep under- 
growth, the sun had set and the 
small boat was a dark blur on their 
private beach. 

Atan stopped dead and Ava, 
programed to keep moving, went 
ahead until she was brought up 
short at the end of his arm. 

^‘What is it now?” 

“The screen. We’re on the wrong 
side of the screen.” 

Truth has its place. But Ava, a 
tired wet nude wanting a bed, 
found it the last straw. Her knees 
buckled and she dropped neatly 



into the river, disappearing as 
though by sleight of hand. 

J AVEH, Commander of Tre- 
gasid Three looked at the main 
scanner without any enthusiasm. 
Vectors were right for a quick 
move out of the gravisphere and 
would not be right again for a 
period of weeks. With three more 
pickups to make he could not af- 
ford the time. 

Latest reports from the home 
base made this mission a pointless 
exercise. Research teams from 
other ships had already reported 
in with better results nearer home. 
Any information from the blue- 
and-white watery sphere below 
was strictly for the archives. Tough 
on the two researchers who had 
spent a year down there. Tough on 
them all, for that matter— no- 
body handed out medals for a sur- 
vey staff that found nothing. 

Atan’s hectare of cultivated 
ground was centered on the screen 
and looked deserted. The com- 
munications exec made no friends 
by putting it into words. 

“I’ve been calling for the last 
hour. Commander. The signal is 
being received. How long do I go 
on?” 

“Give me the link.” 

Javeh watched the screen. 
“Javeh calling Atan. Prepare to 
beam out. Acknowledge.” 



172 



IF 




Nothing intelligent moved be- 
low. A slight breeze rolled an 
empty can from where it had 
lodged at the foot of the dome and 
trundled it across the clearing. In 
its way it made the point. The ship 
was wasting time. The camp was 
deserted. 

Any one of a hundred things 
could have happened. On one 
station a freak magnetic field that 
had not shown up on the first sur- 
vey had drifted over the site, de- 
ranged the protective barrier and 
left the team wide open to attack. 
One sight of the wreckage and he 
had known that search was use- 
less. 

Here trouble looked like the sur- 
vey team’s own fault. In some way 
these two had ignored the safety 
rules and gotten themselves chop- 
ped. 

One thing was for sure — Javeh 
couldn’t leave all the gear there. It 

could last for centuries and would 

\ 

upset the locals. 

He said, “Range about a bit. 
Show me across the river.” 

At first there was nothing. Then 
the operator picked up movement 
among the trees and zoomed down 
for a close up. He found a busy 
group. Twenty or more lightly fur- 
red, advanced hominids — men, 
women and children on a cor- 
porate chore — were building a 
large frame structure. 

THECASTpFFS 



Two were taller, whiter, more 
erect. 

Javeh said, “Hold it there. Get 
closer.” 

“That’s as far as I can go. Com- 
mander.” 

“It’s enough. By God, they’ve 
gone native. Building a rustic 
bower. I’d never have believed it 
possible. That settles it. Give me a 
voice beam to that area and call the 
gunner.” 

The duty gunner in his pod above 
the command dome had seen the 
action on his duplicate screen and 
knew what to expect. 

Javeh said, “Stand by. Destroy 
every item at the campsite as soon 
as I’ve finished.” 

On his outside circuit he ad- 
dressed the working party in a 
voice that boomed from the tree 
tops and stopped the action. There 
was a scurry for cover. Only two 
remained, hand in hand looking at 
the empty sky. 

“Atan and Ava this is Javeh. 
You have put yourselves outside 
Jhe law. I ought to kill you, but I 
should have to destroy innocent 
people near you. As it is you will 
have to make what you can of your 
choice. It is likely to be brutish and 
short. If you have any thought for 
the future you will see that you 
leave no children. Goodbye.” 

A zigzag of eye-aching light 
played on the campsite and the 



173 




crown of the low hill seemed to 
burn without fire. For a brief hyp- 
notic spell nothing changed. Then 
every item folded silently in on it- 
self and there was only fine ash 
spiraling in the gently moving air 
and water boiling at the river’s 
edge. 

A VA was crying silently, tears 
^running unheeded down her 
cheeks and going into free fall. 
Mainly it was for Atan. He had 
worked like a dog on the mission 
and all his careful records were 
turned to dust. Partly it was for a 
situation where he and she could be 
written off without appeal by a 
snap decision. 

Partly also it was because they 
were so near success. Atan had 
reckoned that the best chance was 
to build a tower on the river side of 
the screen, so that he could drop 
over into two meters of water to 
break his fall. 

Making friendly contact with the 
family clan had been tricky 
enough, but he had done it, work- 
ing against time. Another twenty- 
four hours and they would have 
been home and dry. 

Now they were on their own and 
it was her fault. Which reminded 
her that she had never gotten 
around to telling him what she had 
done. 

She said,*"Atan. It’s all my fault. 



Don’t blame yourself. Nobody 
could have done a better job than 
you did. What’s happened is unfair 
to you, not to nie. I deserve it.” 

She was marshaling the story 
line to tell him from the beginning, 
but he turned her towards him, 
hands on her shoulders, bent his 
arms until she had to move her feet 
and close up. 

“Don’t torment yourself, Ava. 
Relax. What do we have? So much 
time either here or on Bromius. 
What does it matter when you get 
right down to it? We have our- 
selves and that’s all there is. Not 
many people get to start over. It’s a 
rebirth. Naked we come into the 
world. Believe me, I have 
everything I want right here. What- 
ever you did, I don’t want to know. 
You did me a favor. If you feel 
about me the way I feel about you 
we don’t have a problem — we have 
the ingredients for a new golden 
age. 

Curious hominids were edging 
cautiously back out of the bush, 
their attention divided between the 
gray-capped empty knoll and the 
couple by the frame tower. 

Ava had linked her fingers be- 
hind his head. 

She said, “Atan.” 

It was an amen, a benediction, an 
affirmation, a prophesy that the 
wilderness could be made to flower 
like any lotus. •

have little in common, except, I 
guess, artistic creativeness. 
Nothing to compare to the unify- 
ing basis for the life arts. Life arts 
could be a subdivision of fine 
arts. 

The definition of art (or life art) 
is then plain: 

Art equals direct and indirect 
Dramatic Illusion, or any com- 
bination of these. (See IF, Oct. 
11, p. 176). 

I also now have derived the defi- 
nition for ars poetica from the 
previous analysis of ‘'bad fic- 
tion' ( God forgive you!). 

Poem: A verbally symmetri- 
cal, audio-metrical Indirect 
Dramatic Illusion. 

That is to say: it is a literary 
work that accentuates verbal 
symmetry (strictly to loosely 
metrically proportioned) to a 
degree inconsistent with the 
natural dramatic requirements 
of the story or account, thereby 
attempting to inject or create 
esthetically pleasing sound pat- 
terns to enhance the value of the 
work or performance. And it can 
be pleasing to the senses and in- 
tellect. 

Henry Bitman 
Azusa, Cal. 

Fiction, which has been my sole 
source of livelihood for thirty-five 
years, has a hard and graspable 
reality of its own. Good fiction is 



art and simulates nothing — it 
simply is its own valid self. Bad 
fiction may pretend to simulate 
other things — and is a lie. 

Let fiction create illusions for 
you if you enjoy them, but I think 
you will enhance your appreci- 
ation if you can bring yourself also 
to view it on its own merits. 

Dear If: 

Last year I appealed to readers 
of a number of magazines, pro 
and fan, for help in locating, for 



READERS with long memories 
have written or called to in- 
form us that the story To Kill A 
Venusian, which appeqred in 
the September-October is- 
sue of IF, is in fact a plagiar- 
ism. 

We have confirmed that the 
original was published by 
FANTASY AND SCIENCE FIC- 
TION in its August 1952 issue, 
the title being Nine-finger 
Jack. The author was the late 
Anthony Boucher. 

IF purchqied the story in good 
faith from one Irwin Ross of

has not been appearing in Galaxy 
because readers did not like his 
comic strip; does that mean he 
shouldn't illustrate covers and 
stories as he did so well previous- 
ly? (2) Please stop cluttering 
Galaxy and IF with fantasy by 
people like Davidson. How can a 
science-fiction magazine pub- 
lish a story with a name like 
Arnten of Ultima Thule? Worlds of 
Fantasy was created to take care 
of this kind of complaint. So what 
happened? 

Jonathan Raz 

Berkeley, Cal. 

The comment to which you re- 
fer {Hue and Cry, August '71) 
read: “ . reader reaction did 
not encourage us to continue 
featuring a cartoon strip." It was 
intended to convey precisely 
what it said, no more, no less. 

Worlds of Fantasy did not come 
into being to take care of com- 
plaints but to publish fantasy. In 
the recent poll conducted in 
Galaxy a substantial majority of 
readers expressed a liking for oc- 
casional fantasy in their sf fare. 
My personal feeling is that it 
should be extremely occasional 
and should have merits beyond its 
category — express some validi- 
ties found in the world of reali- 
ties. 

The phrasing of your letter sug- 
gests I ought to have changed 
Avram Davidson’s title for the 
story. I don’t agree.

Ape you slpesi)y s victim of future shocK? 



The acceleration started with Hiroshima. 
Without warning, we switched to mechanized 
lives, disposable goods, impermanent alle- 
giances. We entered the plug-in, throw-away, 
rent-a-thing, forget-a-person age. We began 
using up products, ideas, people at a dizzying 
rate. 

Some people thrive on the pace. Others 
find it terrifying. Some simply refuse to recog- 
nize it, abruptly colliding with the future and 
suffering an adaptive breakdown. Alvin Tof- 
fler calls it “future shock.” 

What’s the preventative? Start with the
