THE DA Y BEFORE 
THE REVOLUTION 





URSULA K. Ce QUON 

'This story is a ' prequel ' to Ursula's superb 
new novel THE DISPOSSESSED. The 
events depicted herein occur about 
200 years prior to those in the novel. 


T he speaker’s voice was loud as 
empty beer-trucks in a stone 
street, and the people at the meet- 
ing were jammed up close, cobble- 
stones, that great voice booming 
over them. Taviri was somewhere 
on the other side of the hall. She 
had to get to him. She wormed and 
pushed her way among the dark- 
clothed, close-packed people. She 
did not hear the words, nor see the 
faces: only the booming, and the 
bodies pressed one behind the 
other. She could not see Taviri, she 
was too short. A broad black-vested 
belly and chest loomed up blocking 
her way. She must get through to 
Taviri. Sweating, she jabbed fierce- 
ly with her fist. It was like hitting 
stones, he did not move at all, but 
the huge lungs let out right over her 
head a prodigious noise, a bellow. 
She cowered. Then she understood 
that the bellow had not been at her. 
Others were shouting. The speaker 
had said something, something fine 
about taxes or shadows. Thrilled, 
she joined the shouting — “Yes! 
Yes!” — and shoving on, came out 


easily into the open expanse of the 
Regimental Drill Field in Parheo. 
Overhead the evening sky lay deep 
and colorless, and all around her 
nodded the tall weeds with dry, 
white, close-floreted heads. She 
had never known what they were 
called. The flowers nodded above 
her head, swaying in the wind that 
always blew across the fields in the 
dusk. She ran among them, and 
they whipped lithe aside and stood 
up again swaying, silent. Taviri 
stood among the tall weeds in his 
good suit, the dark grey one that 
made him look like a professor or a 
play-actor, harshly elegant. He did 
not look happy, but he was laugh- 
ing, and saying something to her. 
The sound of his voice made her 
cry, and she reached out to catch 
hold of his hand, but she did not 
stop, quite. She could not stop. 
“Oh, Taviri,” she said, “it’s just on 
there!” The queer sweet smell of 
the white weeds was heavy as she 
went on. There were thorns, tangles 
underfoot, there were slopes, pits. 
She feared to fall . she stopped.

S un, bright morning-glare, 
straight in the eyes, relentless. 
She had forgotten to pull the blind 
last night. She turned her back on 
the sun, but the right side wasn’t 
comfortable. No use. Day. She 
sighed twice, sat up, got her legs 
over the edge of the bed, and sat 
hunched in her nightdress looking 
down at her feet. 

The toes, compressed by a life- 
time of cheap shoes, were almost 
square where they touched each 
other, and bulged out above in 
corns; the nails were discolored and 
shapeless. Between the knob-like 
ankle bones ran fine, dry wrinkles. 
The brief little plain at the base of 
the toes had kept its delicacy, but 
the skin was the color of mud, and 
knotted veins crossed the instep. 
Disgusting. Sad, depressing. Mean. 
Pitiful. She tried on all the words, 
and they all fit, like hideous little 
hats. Hideous: yes, that one too. To 
look at oneself and find it hideous, 
what a job! But then, when she 
hadn’t been hideous, had she sat 
around and stared at herself like 
this? Not much! A proper body’s 
not an object, not an implement, 
not a belonging to be admired, it’s 
just you, yourself. Only when it’s no 
longer you, but yours, a thing 
owned, do you worry about it — Is it 
in good shape? Will it do? Will it 
last? 

“Who cares?” said Laia fiercely, 
and stood up. 

It made her giddy to stand up 
suddenly. She had to put out her 


hand to the bedtable, for she 
dreaded falling. At that she thought 
of reaching out to Taviri, in the 
dream. 

What had he said? She could not 
remember. She was not sure if she 
had even touched his hand. She 
frowned, trying to force memory. It 
had been so long since she had 
dreamed about Taviri; and now not 
even to remember what he had 
said! 

It was gone, it was gone. She 
stood there hunched in her night- 
dress, frowning, one hand on the 
bedtable. How long was it since she 
had thought of him — let alone 
dreamed of him — even thought of 
him, as ‘Taviri’? How long since 
she had said his name? 

Asieo said. When Asieo and I 
were in prison in the North. Before 
I met Asieo. Asieo's theory of re- 
ciprocity. Oh yes, she talked about 
him, talked about him too much no 
doubt, maundered, dragged him 
in. But as ‘Asieo,’ the last name, 
the public man. The private man 
was gone, utterly gone. There were 
so few left who had even known 
him. They had all used to be in jail. 
One laughed about it on those 
days, all the friends in all the jails. 
But they weren’t even there, these 
days. They were in the prison ceme- 
teries. Or in the common graves. 

“Oh, oh my dear,” Laia said out 
loud, and she sank down onto the 
bed again because she could not 
stand up under the remembrance 
of those first weeks in the Fort, in 


THE DAY BEFORE THE REVOLUTION 


19 



the cell, those first weeks of the 
nine years in the Fort in Drio, in 
the cell, those first weeks after they 
told her that Asieo had been killed 
in the fighting in Capitol Square 
and had been buried with the Four- 
teen Hundre4 in the lime-ditches 
behind Oring Gate. In the cell. Her 
hands fell into the old position on 
her lap, the left clenched and lock- 
ed inside the grip of the right, the 
right thumb working back and 
forth a little pressing and rubbing 
on the knuckle of the left first 
finger. Hours, days, nights. She 
had thought of them all, each one, 
each one of the fourteen hundred, 
how they lay, how the quicklime 
worked on the flesh, how the bones 
touched in the burning dark. Who 
touched him? How did the slender 
bones of the hand lie now? Hours, 
years. 

“Taviri, I have never forgotten 
you!” she whispered, and the stu- 
pidity of it brought her back to 
morning-light and the rumpled 
bed. Of course she hadn’t forgotten 
him. These things go without say- 
ing between husband and wife. 
There were her ugly old feet flat on 
the floor again, just as before. She 
had got nowhere at all, she had 
gone in a circle. She stood up with a 
grunt of effort and disapproval, 
and went to the closet for her 
dressing gown. 

The young people went about the 
halls of the House in becoming im- 
modesty, but she was too old for 
that. She didn’t want to spoil some 


young man’s breakfast with the 
sight of her. Besides, they had 
grown up in the principle of free- 
dom of dress and sex and all the 
rest, and she hadn’t. All she had 
done was invent it. It’s not the 
same. 

Like speaking of Asieo as ‘my 
husband.’ They winced. The word 
she should use as a good Odonian, 
of course, was ‘partner.’ But why 
the hell did she have to be a good 
Odonian? 

She shuffled down the hall to the 
bathrooms. Mairo was there, wash- 
ing her hair in a lavatory. Laia 
looked at the long, sleek, wet hank 
with admiration. She got out of the 
House so seldom now that she 
didn’t know when she had last seen 
a respectably shaven scalp, but still 
the sight of a full head of hair gave 
her pleasure, vigorous pleasure. 
How many times had she been 
jeered at, Longhair, Longhair, had 
her hair pulled by policemen or 
young toughs, had her hair shaved 
off down to the scalp by a grinning 
soldier at each new prison? And 
then had grown it all over again, 
through the fuzz, to the frizz, to the 
curls, to the mane ... In the old 
days. For God’s love, couldn’t she 
think of anything today but the old 
days? 

Dressed, her bed made, she went 
down to commons. It was a good 
breakfast, but she had never got 
her appetite back since the damned 
stroke. She drank two cups of herb 
tea, but couldn’t finish the piece of 


20 


GALAXY 



fruit she had taken. How she had 
craved fruit as a child, badly 
enough to steal it; and in the 
Fort — oh for God’s love stop it! She 
smiled and replied to the greetings 
and friendly inquiries of the other 
breakfasters and big Aevi who was 
serving the counter this morning. It 
was he who had tempted her with 
the peach, “Look at this. I’ve been 
saving it for you,” and how could 
she refuse? Anyway she had always 
loved fruit, and never got enough; 
once when she was six or seven she 
had stolen a piece off a vendor’s 
cart in River Street. But it was hard 
to eat when everyone was talking so 
excitedly. There was news from 
Thu, real news. She was inclined to 
discount it at first, being wary of 
enthusiasms, but after she had read 
the article in the paper, and read 
between the lines of it, she thought, 
with a strange kind of certainty, 
deep but cold. Why, this is it; it has 
come. And in Thu, not here. Thu 
will break before this country does; 
the Revolution will first prevail 
there. As if that mattered! There 
will be no more nations. And yet it 
did matter somehow, it made her a 
little cold and sad — envious, in 
fact. Of all the infinite stupidities. 
She did not join the talk much, and 
soon got up to go back to her room, 
feeling sorry for herself. She could 
not share their excitement. She was 
out of it, really out of it. It’s not 
easy, she said to herself in justifi- 
cation, laboriously climbing the 
stairs, to accept being out of it 


when you’ve been in it, in the center 
of it, for fifty years. Oh for God’s 
love. Whining! 

She got the stairs and the self- 
pity behind her, entering her room. 
It was a good room, and it was good 
to be by herself. It was a great re- 
lief. Even if it wasn’t strictly fair. 
Some of the kids in the attics were 
living five to a room no bigger than 
this. There were always more 
people wanting to live in an Odo- 
nian House than could be properly 
accommodated. She had this big 
room all to herself only because she 
was an old woman who had had a 
stroke. And maybe because she was 
Odo. If she hadn’t been Odo, but 
merely the old woman with a 
stroke, would she have had it? Very 
likely. After all who the hell wanted 
to room with a drooling old 
woman? But it was hard to be sure. 
Favoritism, elitism, leader-worship, 
they crept back and cropped out 
everywhere. But she had never 
hoped to see them eradicated in her 
lifetime, in one generation; only 
Time works the great changes. 
Meanwhile this was a nice, large, 
sunny room, proper for a drooling 
old woman who had started a world 
revolution. 

Her secretary would be coming in 
an hour to help her dispatch the 
day’s work. She shuffled over to the 
desk, a beautiful, big piece, a 
present from the Nio Cabinet- 
makers’ Syndicate because some- 
body had heard her remark once 
that the only piece of furniture she 


THE DAY BEFORE THE REVOLUTION 


21 



had ever really longed for was a 
desk with drawers and enough 
room on top . damn, the top 
was practically covered with papers 
with notes clipped to them, mostly 
in Noi’s small clear handwriting: 
Urgent. — Northern Provinces. — 
Consult w/R.T.? 

Her own handwriting had never 
been the same since Asieo’s death. 
It was odd, when you thought 
about it. After all, within five years 
after his death she had written the 
whole Analogy. And there were 
those letters, which the tall guard 
with the watery grey eyes, what was 
his name, never mind, had smug- 
gled out of the Fort for her for two 
years. The Prison Letters they 
called them now, there were a 
dozen different editions of them. 
All that stuff, the letters which 
people kept telling her were so full 
of “spiritual strength” — which 
probably meant she had been lying 
herself blue in the face when she 
wrote them, trying to keep her 
spirits up — and the Analogy which 
was certainly the solidest intellec- 
tual work she had ever done, all of 
that had been written in the Fort in 
Drio, in the cell, after Asieo’s 
death. One had to do something, 
and in the Fort they let one have 
paper and pens . But it had all 
been written in the hasty, scribbling 
hand which she had never felt was 
hers, not her own like the round, 
black scrollings of the manuscript 
of Society Without Government. 
forty-five years old. Taviri had 


taken not only her body’s and her 
heart’s desire to the quicklime with 
him, but even her good clear hand- 
writing. 

B ut he had left her the revolu- 
tion. 

How brave of you to go on, to 
work, to write, in prison, after such 
a defeat for the Movement, after 
your partner’s death, people had 
used to say. Damn fools. What else 
had there been to do? Bravery, 
courage — what was courage? She 
had never figured it out. Not fear- 
ing, some said. Fearing yet going 
on, others said. But what could one 
do but go on? Had one any real 
choice, ever? 

To die was merely to go on in 
another direction. 

If you wanted to come home you 
had to keep going on, that was 
what she meant when she wrote, 
“True journey is return,” but it had 
never been more than an intuition, 
and she was farther than ever now 
from being able to rationalise it. 
She bent down, too suddenly, so 
that she grunted a little at the creak 
in her bones, and began to root in a 
bottom drawer of the desk. Her 
hand came to an age-softened 
folder and drew it out, recognizing 
it by touch before sight confirmed: 
the manuscript of Syndical Organi- 
zation in Revolutionary Transition. 
He had printed the title on the 
folder and written his name under 
it, Taviri Odo Asieo, IX 741. There 
was an elegant handwriting, every 


22 


GALAXY 



letter well-formed, bold, and 
fluent. But he had preferred to use 
a voiceprinter. The manuscript was 
all in voiceprint, and high quality 
too, hesitancies adjusted and idio- 
syncrasies of speech normalized. 
You couldn’t see there how he had 
said ‘o’ deep in his throat as they 
did on the North Coast. There was 
nothing of him there but his mind. 
She had nothing of him at all 
except his name written on the 
folder. She hadn’t kept his letters, 
it was sentimental to keep letters. 
Besides, she never kept anything. 
She couldn’t think of anything that 
she had ever owned for more than a 
few years, except this ramshackle 
old body, of course, and she was 
stuck with that . 

Dualizing again. “She” and “it.” 
Age and illness made on dualist, 
made one escapist; the mind in- 
sisted, It's not me, it's not me. But 
it was. Maybe the mystics could de- 
tach mind from body, she had al- 
ways rather wistfully envied them 
the chance, without hope of emu- 
lating them. Escape had never been 
her game. She had sought for free- 
dom here, now, body and soul. 

First self-pity, then self-praise, 
and here she still sat, for God's 
love, holding Asieo’s name in her 
hand, why? Didn’t she know his 
name without looking it up? What 
was wrong with her? She raised the 
folder to her lips and kissed the 
handwritten name firmly and 
squarely, replaced the folder in the 
back of the bottom drawer, shut 


the drawer, and straightened up in 
the chair. Her right hand tingled. 
She scratched it, and then shook it 
in the air, spitefully. It had never 
quite got over the stroke. Neither 
had her right leg, or right eye, or 
the right corner of her mouth. They 
were sluggish, inept, they tingled. 
They made her feel like a robot 
with a short circuit. 

And time was getting on, Noi 
would be coming, what had she 
been doing ever since breakfast? 

She got up so hastily that she 
lurched, and grabbed at the chair- 
back to make sure she did not fall. 
She went down the hall to the bath- 
room and looked in the big mirror 
there. Her grey knot was loose and 
droopy, she hadn’t done it up well 
before breakfast. She struggled 
with it a while. It was hard to keep 
her arms up in the air. Amai, 
running in to piss, stopped and 
said, “Let me do it!” and knotted it 
up tight and neat in no time, with 
her round, strong, pretty fingers, 
smiling and silent. Ami was 
twenty, less than a third of Laia’s 
age. Her parents had both been 
members of the Movement, one 
killed in the insurrection of ’60, the 
other still recruiting in the South 
Provinces. Amai had grown up in 
Odonian Houses, born to the Revo-

kindly, lovely future. 

Laia Osaieo Odo’s right eye wept 
several little tears, as she stood 
between the lavatories and the la- 
trines having her hair done up by 
the daughter she had not borne; 
but her left eye, the strong one, did 
not weep, ilor did it know what the 
right eye did. 

She thanked Amai and hurried 
back to her room. She had noticed, 
in the mirror, a stain on her collar. 
Peach juice, probably. Damned old 
dribbler. She didn’t want Noi to 
come in and find her with drool on 
her collar. 

As the clean shirt went on over 
her head, she thought, What’s so 
special about Noi? 

She fastened the collar-frogs with 
her left hand, slowly, 

Noi was thirty or so, a slight, 
muscular fellow with a soft voice 
and alert dark eyes. That’s what 
was special about Noi. It was that 
simple. Good old sex. She had 
never been drawn to a fair man or a 
fat one, or the tall fellows with big 
biceps, never, not even when she 
was fourteen and fell in love with 
every passing fart. Dark, spare, 
and fiery, that was the recipe. 
Taviri, of course. This boy wasn’t a 
patch on Taviri for brains, nor even 
for looks, but there it was: She 
didn’t want him to see her with 
dribble on her collar and her hair 
coming undone. 

Her thin, grey hair. 

Noi came in, just pausing in the 
open doorway — my God, she hadn’t 


even shut the door while changing 
her shirt! — She looked at him and 
saw herself. The old woman. 

You could brush your hair and 
change your shirt, or you could 
wear last week’s shirt and last 
night's braids, or you could put on 
cloth of gold and dust your shaven 
scalp with diamond powder. None 
of it would make the slightest dif- 
ference. The old woman would look 
a little less, or a little more, gro- 
tesque. 

One keeps oneself neat out of 
mere decency, mere sanity, aware- 
ness of other people. 

And finally even that goes, and 
one dribbles unashamed. 

“Good morning,” the young man 
said in his gentle voice. 

“Hello, Noi.” 

No, by God, it was not out of 
mere decency. Decency be damned. 
Because the man she had loved, 
and to whom her age would not 
have mattered — because he was 
dead, must she pretend she had no 
sex? Must she suppress the truth, 
like a damned puritan authori- 
tarian? Even six months ago, be- 
fore the stroke, she had made men 
look at her and like to look at her; 
and now, though she could give no 
pleasure, by God she could please 
herself. 

When she was six years old, and 
Papa’s friend Gadeo used to come 
by to talk politics with Papa after 
dinner, she would put on the gold- 
colored necklace that Mama had 
found on a trash-heap and brought 


24

home for her. It was so short that it 
always got hidden under her collar 
where nobody could see it. She 
liked it that way. She knew she had 
it on. She sat on the doorstep and 
listened to them talk, and knew 
that she looked nice for Gadeo. He 
was dark, with white teeth that 
flashed. Sometimes he called her 
“pretty Laia.” “There’s my pretty 
Laia!” Sixty-six years ago. 

“What? My head’s dull. I had a 
terrible night.” It was true. She 
had slept even less than usual. 

“I was asking if you’d seen the 
papers this morning.” 

She nodded. 

“Pleased about Soinehe?” 

Soinehe was the province in Thu 
which had declared its secession 
from the Thuvian State last night. 

He was pleased about it. His 
white teeth flashed in his dark, 
alert face. Pretty Laia. 

“Yes. And apprehensive.” 

“I know. But it’s the real thing, 
this time. It’s the beginning of the 
end of the Government in Thu. 
They haven’t even tried to order 
troops into Soinehe, you know. It 
would merely provoke the soldiers 
into rebellion sooner, and they 
know it.” 

She agreed with him. She herself 
had felt that certainty. But she 
could not share his delight. After a 
lifetime of living on hope because 
there is nothing but hope, one loses 
the taste for victory. A real sense of 
triumph must be preceded by real 
despair. She had unlearned despair 


a long time ago. There were no 
more triumphs. One went on. 

“Shall we do those letters to*, 
day?” 

“All right. Which letters?” 

“To the people in the North,” he 
said without impatience. 

“In the North?” 

“Parheo, Oaidun.” 

She had been born in Parheo, the 
dirty city on the dirty river. She had 
not come here to the capital till she 
was twenty-two and ready to bring 
the Revolution. Though in those 
days, before she and the others had 
thought it through, it had been a 
very green and puerile revolution. 
Strikes for better wages, represen- 
tation for women. Votes and 
wages — Power and Money, for the 
love of God! Well, one does learn a 
little, after all, in fifty years. 

But then one must forget it all. 

“Start with Oaidun,” she said, 
sitting down in the armchair. Noi 
was at the desk ready to work. He 
read out excerpts from the letters 
she was to answer. She tried to pay 
attention, and succeeded well 
enough that she dictated one whole 
letter and started on another. “Re- 
member that at this stage your 
brotherhood is vulnerable to the 
threat of . no, to the danger . 
to . .” She groped till Noi sug- 
gested, “The danger of leader-wor- 
ship?” 

“All right. And that nothing is so 
soon corrupted by power-seeking as 
altruism. No. And that nothing 
corrupts altruism — no. Oh for 


THE DAY BEFORE THE REVOLUTION

God’s love you know what I’m 
trying to say, Noi, you write it. 
They know it too, it’s just the same 
old stuff, why can’t they read my 
books!” 

“Touch,” Noi said gently, smil- 
ing, citing one of the central 
Odonian themes. 

“All right, but I’m tired of being 
touched. If you’ll write the letter I’ll 
sign it, but I can’t be bothered with 
it this morning.” He was looking at 
her with a little question or con- 
cern. She said, irritable, “There is 
something else I have to do!” 

W hen Noi had gone she sat 
down at the desk and moved 
the papers about, pretending to be 
doing something, because she had 
been startled, frightened, by the 
words she had said. She had 
nothing else to do. She never had 
had anything else to do. This was 
her work: her lifework. The speak- 
ing tours and the meetings and the 
streets were out of reach for her 
now, but she could still write, and 
that was her work. And anyhow if 
she had had anything else to do, 
Noi would have known it; he kept 
her schedule, and tactfully remind- 
ed her of things, like the visit from 
the foreign students this afternoon. 

Oh, damn. She liked the young, 
and there was always something to 
learn from a foreigner, but she was 
tired of new faces, and tired of 
being on view. She learned from 
them, but they didn’t learn from 
her; they had learnt all she had to 


teach long ago, from her books, 
from the Movement. They just 
came to look, as if she were the 
Great Tower in Rodarred, or the 
Canyon of the Tulaevea. A pheno- 
menon, a monument. They were 
awed, adoring. She snarled at 
them: Think your own thoughts! — 
That's not anarchism, that’s mere 
obscurantism. — You don’t think 
liberty and discipline are incom- 
patible, do you? — They accepted 
their tonguelashing meekly as chil- 
dren, gratefully, as if she were some 
kind of All-Mother, the idol of the' 
Big Sheltering Womb. She! She 
who had mined the shipyards at 
Seissero, and had cursed Premier 
Inoilte to his face in front of a 
crowd of seven thousand, telling 
him he would have cut off his own 
balls and had them bronzed and 
sold as souvenirs, if he thought 
there was any profit in it — she who 
had screeched, and sworn, and 
kicked policemen, and spat at 
priests, and pissed in public on the 
big brass plaque in Capitol Square 
that said here was founded the 

SOVEREIGN NATION STATE OF A-IO 

etc etc, pssssssss to all that! And 
now she was everybody’s grand- 
mama, the dear old lady, the sweet 
old monument, come worship at 
the womb. The fire’s out, boys, it’s 
safe to come up close. 

“No, I won’t,” Laia said out 
loud. “I will not.” She was not self- 
conscious about talking to herself, 
because she always had talked to 
herself. “Laia’s invisible audience,” 


26 


GALAXY 



Taviri had used to say, as she went 
through the room muttering. “You 
needn’t come, I won’t be here,” she 
told the invisible audience now. She 
had just decided what it was she 
had to do. She had to go out. To go 
into the streets. 

It was inconsiderate to disap- 
point the foreign students. It was 
erratic, typically senile. It was un- 
Odonian. Pssssss to all that. What 
was the good working for freedom 
all your life and ending up without 
any freedom at all? She would go 
out for a walk. 

"What is an anarchist? One 
who, choosing, accepts the respon- 
sibility of choice. " 

On the way downstairs she de- 
cided, scowling, to stay and see the 
foreign students. But then she 
would go out. 

They were very young students, 
very earnest: doe-eyed, shaggy, 
charming creatures from the West- 
ern Hemisphere, Benbili and the 
Kingdom of Mand, the girls in 
white trousers, the boys in long 
kilts, warlike and archaic. They 
spoke of their hopes. “We in Mand 
are so very far from the Revolution 
that maybe we are near it,” said 
one of the girls, wistful and smil- 
ing: “The Circle of Life!” and she 
showed the extremes meeting, in 
the circle of her slender, dark- 
skinned fingers. Amai and Aevi 
served them white wine and brown 
bread, the hospitality of the House. 
But the visitors, unpresumptuous, 
all rose to take their leave after 


barely half an hour. “No, no, no,” 
Laia said, “stay here, talk with 
Aevi and Amai. It’s just that I get 
stiff sitting down, you see, I have to 
change about. It has been so good 
to meet you, will you come back to 
see me, my little brothers and 
sisters, soon?” For her heart went 
out to them, and theirs to her, and 
she exchanged kisses all round, 
laughing, delighted by the dark 
young cheeks, the affectionate eyes, 
the scented hair, before she shuffled 
off. She was really a little tired, but 
to go up and take a nap would be a 
defeat. She had wanted to go out. 
She would go out. She had not been 
alone outdoors since — when? since 
winter! before the stroke. No won- 
der she was getting morbid. It had 
been a regular jail sentence. Out- 
side, the streets, that’s where she 
lived. 

She went quietly out the side 
door of the House, past the vege- 
table patch, to the street. The 
narrow strip of sour city dirt had 
been beautifully gardened and was 
producing a fine crop of beans and 
ceea, but Laia’s eye for farming was 
unenlightened. Of course it had 
been clear that anarchist communi- 
ties, even in the time of transition, 
must work towards optimal self- 
support, but how that was to be 
managed in the way of actual dirt 
and plants wasn’t her business. 
There were farmers and agrono- 
mists for that. Her job was the 
streets, the noisy, stinking streets of 
stone, where she had grown up and 


THE DAY BEFORE THE REVOLUTION 


27 



lived all her life, except for the 
fifteen years in prison. 

She looked up fondly at the fa- 
cade of the House. That it had been 
built as a bank gave peculiar satis- 
faction to its present occupants. 
They kept their sacks of meal in the 
bombproof money-vault, and aged 
their cider in kegs in safe deposit 
boxes. Over the fussy columns that 
faced the street, carved letters still 
read, “national investors and 

GRAIN FACTORS BANKING ASSOCIA- 
TION.’’ The Movement was not 
strong on names. They had no flag. 
Slogans came and went as the need 
did. There was always the Circle of 
Life to scratch on walls and pave- 
ments where Authority would have 
to see it. But when it came to names 
they were indifferent, accepting 
and ignoring whatever they got 
called, afraid ofbeing pinned down 
and penned in, unafraid of being 
absurd. So this best known and 
second oldest of all the cooperative 
Houses had no name except The 
Bank. 

It faced on a wide and quiet 
street, but, only a block away began 
the Temeba, an open market, once 
famous as a center for black 
market psychogenics and terato- 
genics, now reduced to vegetables, 
secondhand clothes, and miserable 
sideshows. Its crapulous vitality 
was gone, leaving only half-para- 
lysed alcoholics, addicts, cripples, 
hucksters, and fifth-rate whores, 
pawnshops, gambling dens, for- 
tune-tellers, body sculptors, and 


cheap hotels. Laia turned to the 
Temeba as water seeks its level. 

She had never feared or despised 
the city. It was her country. There 
would not be slums like this, if the 
Revolution prevailed. But there 
would be misery. There would 
always be misery, waste, cruelty. 
She had never pretended to be 
changing the human condition, to 
be Mama taking tragedy away from 
the children so they won’t hurt 
themselves. Anything but. So long 
as people were free to choose, if 
they chose to drink flybane and live 
in sewers, it was their business. Just 
so long as it wasn’t the business of 
Business, the source of profit and 
the means of power for other 
people. She had felt all that before 
she knew anything; before she 
wrote the first pamphlet, before she 
left Parheo, before she knew what 
‘capital’ meant, before she’d been 
farther than River Street where she 
played rolltaggie kneeling on 
scabby knees on the pavement with 
the other six-year-olds. She had 
known it: that she, and the other 
kids, and her parents, and their 
parents, and the drunks and whores 
and all of River Street, was at the 
bottom of something — was the 
foundation, the reality, the source. 

But will you drag civilisation 
down into the mud? cried the 
shocked decent people, later on, 
and she had tried for years to ex- 
plain to them that if all you had was 
mud, then if you were God you 
made it into human beings, and if 


28 


GALAXY 



you were human you tried to make 
it into houses where human beings 
could live. But nobody who thought 
he was better than mud would 
understand. Now, water seeking its 
level, mud to mud, Laia shuffled 
through the foul, noisy street, and 
all the ugly weakness of her old age 
was at home. The sleepy whores, 
their lacquered hair-arrangements 
dilapidated and askew, the one- 
eyed woman wearily yelling her 
vegetables to sell, the halfwit beg- 
gar slapping flies, these were her 
countrywomen. They looked like 
her, they were all sad, disgusting, 
mean, pitiful, hideous. They were 
her sisters, her own people. 

She did not feel very well. It had 
been a long time since she had 
walked so far, four or five blocks, 
by herself, in the noise and push 
and stinking summer heat of the 
streets. She had wanted to get to 
Koly Park, the triangle of scruffy 
grass at the end of the Temeba, and 
sit there for a while with the other 
old men and women who always sat 
there, to see what it was like to sit 
there and be old; but it was too far. 
If she didn’t turn back now, she 
might get a dizzy spell, and she had 
a dread of falling down, falling 
down and having to lie there and 
look up at the people come to stare 
at the old woman in a fit. She 
turned and started home, frowning 
with effort and self-disgust. She 
could feel her face very red, and a 
swimming feeling came and went in 
her ears. It got a bit much, she was 


really afraid she might keel over. 
She saw a doorstep in the shade 
and made for it, let herself down 
cautiously, sat, sighed. 

Nearby was a fruit-seller, sitting 
silent behind his dusty, withered 
stock. People went by. Nobody 
bought from him. Nobody looked 
at her. Odo, who was Odo? Famous 
revolutionary, author of Commu- 
nity, The Analogy, etc. etc. She, 
who was she? An old woman with 
grey hair and a red face sitting on a 
dirty doorstep in a slum, muttering 
to herself. 

True? Was that she? Certainly it 
was what anybody passing her saw. 
But was it she, herself, any more 
than the famous revolutionary, 
etc., was? No. It was not. But who 
was she, then? 

The one who loved Taviri. 

Yes. True enough. But not 
enough. That was gone; he had 
been dead so long. 

“Who am I?” Laia muttered to 
her invisible audience, and they 
knew the answer and told it to her 
with one voice. She was the little 
girl with scabby knees, sitting on 
the doorstep staring down through 
the dirty golden haze of River 
Street in the heat of late summer, 
the six-year-old, the sixteen-year- 
old, the fierce, cross, dream-ridden 
girl, untouched, untouchable. She 
was herself. Indeed she had been 
the tireless worker and thinker, but 
a bloodclot in a vein had taken that 
woman away from her. Indeed she 
had been the lover, the swimmer in 


THE DAY BEFORE THE REVOLUTION 


29 



the midst of life, but Taviri, dying, 
had taken that woman away with 
him. There was nothing left, really, 
but the foundations. She had come 
home; she had never left home. 
“True voyage is return.” Dust and 
mud and a doorstep in the slums. 
And beyond,' at the far end of the 
street, the field full of tall dry weeds 
blowing in the wind as night came. 

“Laia! What are you doing here? 
Are you all right?” 

One of the people from the 
House, of course, a nice woman, a 
bit fanatical and always talking. 
Laia could not remember her name 
though she had known her for 
years. She let herself be taken 
home, the woman talking all the 
way. In the big cool common- 
room (once occupied by tellers 
counting money behind polished 
counters supervised by armed 
guards) Laia sat down in a chair. 
She was unable just as yet to face 
climbing the stairs, though she 
would have liked to be alone. The 
woman kept on talking, and other 
excited people came in. It appeared 
that a demonstration was being 
planned. Events in Thu were mov- 
ing so fast that the mood here had 
caught fire, and something must be 
done. Day after tomorrow, no, to- 
morrow, there was to be a march, a 
big one, from Old Town to Capitol 
Square — the old route. “Another 
Ninth Month Uprising,” said a 
young man, fiery and laughing, 
glancing at Laia. He had not even 
been born at the time of the Ninth 


Month Uprising, it was all history 
to him. Now he wanted to make 
some history of his own. The room 
had filled up. A general meeting 
would be held here, tomorrow, at 
eight in the morning. “You must 
talk, Laia.” 

“Tomorrow? Oh, I won’t be here 
tomorrow,” she said brusquely. 
Whoever had asked her smiled, 
another one laughed, though Amai 
glanced round at her with a puzzled 
look. They went on talking and 
shouting. The Revolution. What on 
earth had made her say that? What 
a thing to say on the eve of the 
Revolution, even if it was true. 

She waited her time, managed to 
get up and, for all her clumsiness, 
to slip away unnoticed among the 
people busy with their planning 
and excitement. She got to the hall, 
to the stairs, and began to climb 
them one by one. “The general 
strike,” a voice, two voices, ten 
voices were saying in the room 
below, behind her. “The general 
strike,” Laia muttered, resting for 
a moment on the landing. Above, 
ahead, in her room, what awaited 
her? The private stroke. That was 
mildly funny. She started up the 
second flight of stairs, one by one, 
one leg at a time, like a small child. 
She was dizzy, but she was no 
longer afraid to fall. On ahead, on 
there, the dry white flowers nodded 
and whispered in the open fields of 
evening. Seventy-two years and she 
had never had time to learn what 
they were called. *

PROLOGUE 

Dear Jim: 

Here are the remarks you sug- 
gested as a sort of prologue to 
COMPANY OF GLORY. Luckily 
pre-dinner speakers are under some 
control, because like their victims 
they want to get on with the eating. 

In my novel DAVY, that red- 
headed kid’s troubles began when 
he was born in the 303rd year after 
the collapse of what we describe as 
20th Century culture. He and most 
of his contemporaries believed that 
during a period after the collapse 
which they called the Years of Con- 
fusion no trustworthy records were 
kept. But he grew up in Moha, 
where they don’t know any better. 
In such a place as Nuber in Katskil, 
founded directly in the ashes, there 
would always have been some clerk 
who could tell the politicians just 
what day of what week of what year 
it was — and be right, too. And this 
story, which in a way grew back- 
ward out of DAVY, belongs to the 
Year 47, when a number of people 
such as Demetrios and Mam Es- 
telle could well remember that age 
which was already being called Old 
Time, and count the years. 

As in DAVY, there are no gad- 
gets. My raw material is just People 
and Possibilities, and a touch of the 
Peculiar. In COMPANY OF 
GLORY outer space stays right 
where it was when we last looked, 
and creatures with eye-stalks re- 
main at the bottom of the sea. The 
unexpected animals, here and in 
DAVY, could all be there without 
even a whisper about mutation. 
This is true of the other stories de- 


rived from the world that began, in 
the literary sense, with DAVY — 
TIGER BOY, THENIGHTWIND, 
THE FRESHMAN ANGLE, MY 
BROTHER LEOPOLD; also THE 
CHILDREN’S CRUSADE and 
the other stories still to appear in 
Putnam’s “Continuum” series. 
Making a world is a pleasant occu- 
pation, and I hope I’ve been rea- 
sonably consistent without too 
many goofs. It’s an occupation we 
all carry on, I notice, one way or 
another, and that’s one thing that 
gives me hope for the damned 
human race. 

As for the Peculiar — well, it’s 
here too. An element of fantasy has 
come into this story — I use that 
kicked-around word because I 
don’t know of any other — and I 
can’t apologize for it. There’s a fog 
with a character in it some of us 
have met, and curious things hap- 
pen, and symbolism was always up 
to the reader — all the author can do 
is brush his hands smugly and walk 
away. In the game of drawing the 
line between poetry and prose, I 
don’t play. (And damn it, all fiction 
is fantasy, including campaign 
speeches, book reviews, and seed 
catalogs.) For most of the weirdities 
in COMPANY OF GLORY a 
solemn “realistic” explanation 
could be worked out, I guess, but 
my most loving friends will be those 
willing to relax and enjoy it. I’d like 
to deserve one thing that Huck 
Fjnn said of Mr. Mark Twain: 
“There was things which he stretch- 
ed, but mainly he told the truth.” 

Best, 

Edgar

I 


There will be Love in it 

If l missed my other glimpses of 
infinity I may find it in a blade 
of grass. — DEMETRIOS 

T he old man swung his walnut 
stick, enjoying the heft of it but 
not dependent on it; he was no 
more blind than Homer. Ambling 
down Harrow Street, he encoun- 
tered a boy leading a horse to the 
blacksmith, and some girls who 
had toiled up from the creek with 
laundry baskets. “A good day to 
you. Garth. How’s Frankie?” 

“And to you, Demetrios,” the 
boy said, smiling with warmth and 
shyness. “Frankie he’s tine.” Garth 
stood idly rubbing his horse’s neck, 
watchful of the girls in their damp 
smocks, who had set down their 
baskets and were poking at their 
hair, but he was mindful of the old 
man too. No one ignored the story- 
teller. 

Demetrios’ peregrine face ap- 
peared to fly toward you even when 
motionless. His long right hand, 
prominent in the joints, might rest 
on his walnut staff and still point 
toward the outlands, the foreign 
visions. Demetrios stood tall — ad- 
vantageous for one gazing over pre- 
occupied heads. His gray hair, 
lightly silvered, fell straight to his 
shoulders. He was sixty, not old but 
seasoned, like his walnut stick, like 
a wine held long enough in the cask 
to have ripened in a way that might 
not suit everyone. The boy Garth, 
at an age when a good heart’s love 
must flow outward, adored him — 
what other ancient would remem- 


ber a stable-boy’s name and his 
little brother too? And some were 
caught by Demetrios’ professional 
skill as a story-teller, neither liking 
nor disliking him but granting 
some tribute of listening. A girl 
named Solitaire desired him and 
was desired. 

From a side-street a peddlar, a 
ragpicker older than Demetrios, 
pushed his two-wheel barrow near 
them and rested it on its one-leg 
stand, mopping his face with a 
grimy cloth. The afternoon hung 
heavy with July; a wind heaving 
gray masses through the mountain 
air was not felt here, not yet, 
though before long a thunderstorm 
might drop on the meager make- 
shift town, stirring the mud, trash, 
and sewage in Nuber’s streets and 
flushing a portion of the filth down 
the channels of the central ditches, 
shifting corruption from one spot to 
another as human society has done 
so long, so long. Time-beaten him- 
self and practised in impudence — 
(any publicity is good publicity, 
they used to say in Old Time, so 
I’m told, until they choked on it) — 
the peddler felt privileged to croak: 
“Dimmy, you old blast of wind! 
Got a story for us — one with balls 
to it?” 

“Yours hanging low, Potter- 
field?” Demetrios’ softer tone could 
have been heard sixty feet down the 
block. One of the girls giggled, 
spreading a laundry-pink hand 
over her mouth and watching 
Garth, who blushed easily; he 
wasn’t over fifteen. Raised to reach 
the back row of a crowd, Deme- 
trios’ baritone sometimes sounded 
high in pitch. He had sung a little 
once, until a musician told him his

ear was not quite true. His voice 
was better for spoken dreams. A 
woman leaned generously from a 
first-floor window with a dust-cloth 
over her hair, and Demetrios ask- 
ed: “May I sit myself here, Mam, 
while I tell ybu a tale of some sort if 
you want one?” 

"The ssph — ” she spat a peach- 
pit into the sunken entry-way below 
her window and settled herself — 
“the steps a’n’t ourn, we only rent. 
Sit anyhow and tell your tale, dear 
soul. I’ll fight any sunny-bitch says 
you can’t.” 

“So maybe I’ll make it a tale for 
you, and there will be love in it, and 
Potterfield must put up with it.” 

“I got no cause against love,” 
grumbled Potterfield, “as the fly 
said when his poor arse got jammed 
into the honey.” 

Demetrios sat in the shade and 
rested his hands on the knob of his 
walnut stick, and shut his eyes a 
summoning while, watching the 
midnight ocean of memory and re- 
flection for whatever cargo might 
seek the industrious wharves and 
warehouses of his mind. He knew a 
familiar fear, that on this day no 
ships had sailed: such days do ar- 
rive to afflict us. “I was a child,” he 
said. “I think I’ve told no tales of 
childhood. There was once — no, 
not that one. Let me mull it over. 
Wind’s in the east — that’s not one 
of the fair-blowing winds . All 
stories begin in childhood. Before 
speech. 

44'U'ear then that I who talk to 

llyou was born in a small 
town that might seem large to you. 
Its population was about three 
thousand— before the Twenty-Min- 


ute War, which marks the Year 
One of our calendar. And I suppose 
the present population here in the 
city of Nuber is hardly more than 
that — four thousand possibly, four 
thousand loyal subjects of the 
King’s republic,” he said, and 
nobody laughed. 

“My birth-town was named Hes- 
terville, and it was not many miles 
up a great river from the city of 
Hannibal in what was the state of 
Missouri. Missouri’s a long way 
west — no matter if you never heard 
of it. A man named Sam Clemens 
was born at Hannibal, by the way, 
one hundred and forty-five years 
before my birth at Hesterville'. I 
think of him because he was a 
story-teller too, but a great one. His 
tales were written in books, the 
books multiplied to thousands — 
that’s called printing and you’ve 
heard of it; I’m told there’s a hand 
press here at Nuber, I mean an- 
other besides the legal one they use 
in the Inner City. So Clemens’ 
stories were read and preserved all 
over the world, which was larger 
then, dear souls, and quite round. 
He wrote them under the invented 
name of Mark Twain, better known 
than his original name. Names are 
important: with them we can talk 
to each other, a little. Mark 
Twain’s stories will last, unless all 
books are lost and destroyed; even 
then bits of them will be told for a 
while. My stories are written on the 
air. Who knows where a story goes 
after the poet gives it to the 
winds?” 

Then, I know, the old man 
brooded, on whether to give them 
some of Huck Finn’s tale — The 
contexts are gone. There was a 


36 


GALAXY 



slavery in 1993, but the method and 
the idiom of it were altogether dif- 
ferent. It was supervised by po- 
faced experts who gave it the name 
of Temporary Suspension of Nor- 
malcy. What could these ignorant 
friendly folk make of openly ad- 
mitted slavery? Or of Nigger Jim? 

‘All right, I'll GO to Hell!" — what 
could they make of that? Contexts 
gone. As for Huck's antebellum 
world, lost so long ago that even to 
in\> boyhood reading it seemed re- 
moter than Pan's Arcadia — why, of 
that they might understand a little 
if I could transmit it to them. It is 
nearer to us than it was at any time 
in the 20th Century, now that the 
flabby plastic carcass of indus- 
trialism is buried. Gradually the air 
loses that foulness; the earth, and 
even the tortured and degraded 
sea, begin to regain some of the 
beauty that dollar- progress ravaged 
and smeared. There's loss too. So 
be it. If I missed my other glimpses 
of infinity I may find it in a blade of 
grass. 

H e knew he had been keeping 
silent too long. He opened his 
eyes and beamed on his audience 
with a practised shrewdness, to let 
them know he had not dozed off 
senile and forgetful. They were at- 
tentive; one or two smiled back. 
Others had strolled up during his 
abstraction — he had been aware of 
their coming but had wanted to 
follow his thought further. In a 
time when literacy is rare the story- 
teller and newsbearer come into 
their own and the memories of 
some listeners develop astonishing 
powers. Demetrios studied the little 
crowd, some of the faces dubiously 


familiar but all without names ex- 
cept the plump sweet face of Garth. 

In the canvas cap that he had 
dropped upside down near his feet 
a few coins were lying. Most of 
these were the brass pennies of the 
King’s Republic of Katskil, crudely 
stamped with the slab-jawed face of 
Brian II. (Like his father Brian I, 
he called his monarchy a Pro- 
visional Government, its holy aim 
the restoration of the United States 
of America, which alas was not 
quite practical right now.) Among 
the pennies shone a startling frag- 
ment of the past, accepted legal 
tender but a great rarity, an Old- 
Time silver dime worth at least fifty 
of the Katskil pennies. Who in this 
group would have been that munif- 
icent? 

It was almost certainly the dark- 
haired youth who sat apart from 
the rest holding the leash of a gray 
wolfhound. His linen tunic and 
loincloth were cream-white, unoffi- 
cial sign of the aristocracy; though 
not a matter of law, none but they 
wore the expensive bleached linen 
in public; commoners put up with 
clothes slung together by the inex- 
pert housewife or sweatshop serf 
from ill-woven drab-colored wool, 
or linsey-woolsey — wool and linen 
remnants and scraps. The aristoc- 
racy took pride in cleanness, while 
on some other levels dirt was 
equated with virtue. This youth’s 
deerhide hip satchel and moccasins 
would have been made by the 
bonded servants, virtually slaves, 
who did such labor for the Inner 
City and the large estates in the 
suburbs. The boy’s direct and inno- 
cent gaze troubled Demetrios, who 
was haunted by another world dead 


THE COMPANY OF GLORY

for nearly half a century. “1 think a 
story goes wherever there’s a spark 
of hearing life. In Hesterville we 
had those devices that seem fairy- 
tale fancies to anyone too young to 
have seen them. Nobody here ex- 
cept Potterfield would recall them 
as I do — telephones, automobiles, 
radio, earth-moving machines, air- 
craft. Naturally you find it hard to 
believe in them. Remember space 
flight, Potterfield?” 

"Shit,” said the peddler. “Made 
that one up, di’n’t they? I never 
seen no sacklite go up except like 
on the teevy same as them other 
space-oprieswith made-up people.” 

“What happened to your teevy?” 
asked the dark-haired boy. 

“Busted,” said Potterfield. 
“Busted, sir. See, when the power 
went bleh, wouldn’t nothing work.” 
He winked at Demetrios, sharing 
an ancient half-wisdom gone use- 
less and sour. “So my girl friend 
Hang a bottle of hand lotion into 
it — an empty one. Was her teevy 
actually. Was shacking up with her 
at the time, fifty years ago near- 
about. I’m seventy now by Jesus, 
since you ask.” 

“You remember the cars too,” 
said Demetrios. “Remember the 
telephones? Jet planes?” 

“Of course. Even now if I have to 
gosemplace I think, oh, I’ll just 
phone, and then I think, well, 
shit.” Potterfield scratched under 
his soggy loin-rag, irritated by 
many griefs, old age not the least of 
them. Crab-lice, rats, and fleas had 
survived the long-ago holocaust 
abundantly. During the last two or 
three decades, as the risen waters 
held their level with only slight 
fluctuations, a small aggressive 


variety of short-tailed rat was doing 
especially well — dark-pelted, sav- 
age, with a liking for the new 
human dwellings that were no 
longer set up on concrete founda- 
tions. It might be a sport from the 
prolific meadow- mouse of Old 
Time, Demetrios thought, but there 
was no one to discuss it with him 
who would even know the word 
“genetics”. “Better off, ain’t we?” 
said Potterfield. He would have 
been about twenty, Demetrios re- 
flected, when fire scourged the 
cities and the short plagues follow- 
ed, radiation deaths and epidemics 
of crushing virulence with no means 
for study or control. The gTeat Red 
Plague did not come until sixteen 
years later, when Demetrios was 
twenty-nine, and living at Nuber. 
Potterfield must have been a simple 
young man (if any human being 
ever answered that description) 
with a hunger for simple satisfac- 
tions (if there are any satisfactions 
that don’t spread like pond ripples 
to infinity). There had been so 
many like him! Male and female of 
all ages, passing four billion by the 
estimates of 1990, in spite of a 
slight drop in the birth rate and the 
desolating famines of the late 
197Q’s and early 1980’s. “Better 
off, not so much crap all the time 
flying at you. Man has a chance to 
think,” said Potterfield. “You 
wouldn’t believe the amount of 
deep thinking I get through now- 
adays. Get on with your story, 
Dimmy — I set down here to be 
entertained, di'n’t I?” 

ffm/ou shall be, if you stay 
JL awake. I grew up in that 
world." said Demetrios, “to the age 


38 


GALAXY 



of thirteen, not comfortable, for no- 
body was then except the unthink- 
ing, who can be comfortable on the 
side of a volcano. Being a child, of 
course I was often unthinking too. 
I—” 

“Aw, Demetrios!” The woman in 
the window had finished her peach 
and wiped her mouth on her arm. 
“Volcano? You got to use all them 
big words? What’s a volcano?” 

“Sorry, Mam. A volcano is a 
mountain with a hole in its top. 
From time to time the hole lets out 
the fire of the earth, in a molten 
river that rolls down the mountain 
burning everything. Did you know, 
my darling, the inside of the earth 
is a core of fire? Every day you walk 
above a cellar of fire, my darling. 
Now no more questions or I stop my 
tale.” But it was the boy Garth who 
showed alarm and even glanced 
sheepishly down toward his feet; 
the woman was only amused and 
not believing. “Yes, I grew up in 
that world, my father a doctor and 
a wise man. My mother was a 
painter of pictures. There are some 
in Nuber; she was more skillful 
than any you know — and had better 
materials to work with of course. 
My father was known as Dr. Isaac 
Freeman of Hesterville, and my 
name — why, my name was Adam 
Freeman. I have not told of these 
things before.” And what comes 
over you now, to go so falteringly 
toward the telling of them? They 
don't want this, Demetrios. They’ 
want romances, fairy-tales, even 
allegory if you're careful — words to 
ease the sting of daily hardships, 
hut certainly not the story of how 
things really were! Well, the wind is 
in the east. “I must feel my way. 


dear souls. My name was not then 
Demetrios. It was Adam Freeman. 

“My name has been Demetrios 
for forty-seven years — long enough 
to have seen these near waters rise 
and become the Hudson Sea. I have 
beheld one more messiah, seven- 
teen years ago, and his martyrdom 
by those he sought to save. I speak 
of the man Abraham whom some 
call prophet, bound on the wheel in 
Gallows Square of this town.” 
“Was he not a prophet?” asked 
the youth with the wolfhound. “I’m 
sorry — I didn’t mean to interrupt.” 
“All men are prophets,” said 
Demetrios, studying him. His pres- 
ence here was only a little odd. 
Citizens of the Inner City, who 
could go wherever they pleased, 
were not uncommonly seen in the 
open streets, especially with pro- 
tecting dogs or servants, and 
though they seldom bothered to 
pause for streetcorner storytellers, 
there was no reason to wonder at it. 
“And since men never agree, per- 
haps no man should have the 
name. My name is Demetrios. It 
means ‘belonging to the earth’ — 
‘sacred to the earth’. In ancient 
times a goddess Demeter was wor- 
shipped as the spirit of the earth, 
the all-mother — worshipped under 
other names too. Demeter was the 
name given her by the Greeks — 
you know of them, sir?” 

The boy looked bothered, per- 
haps by the “sir" from one so much 
older; but most people wearing 
such linen would take it as their 
natural right. “I do know of them,” 
he said, and smiled, not arrogantly. 
“I know some of the books.” 
Demetrios nodded, “Then you 
will have found there’s life in them.

1 am Demetrios. If anyone called 
me on the street by that name 
Adam Freeman I might not under- 
stand it was meant for me. My 
father used to call me Ad; to my 
mother, who was Welsh, I was 
Adam-bach. 

“I was thirteen in the year 1993, 
old calendar. Now remember, dear 
souls, a whole continent extends to 
the west, north, and south of here — 
what the ocean hasn’t submerged — 
and in that region our entire nation 
of Katskil would amount to a 
fingernail wedge of dirt on a big 
blanket. That’s the vast region 
you’re speaking of when you say 
‘United States of America’. Up to 
the year 1993, after which there’s 
no written history we know of ex- 
cept for our little fingernail wedge, 
the rest of the world was marked off 
into other territorial divisions large 
and small — maybe it still is, but no 
one speaks across the oceans any 
more. Those divisions all called 
themselves nations, and were quite 
free to make war on each other with 
weapons that could turn the earth 
into a slag-heap— as it is today in 
many places, some not far from 
here. Nations and alliances of na- 
tions, dear souls, have not the 
mother-wit to avoid the stupid pas- 
sion of war. Nations are no more 
capable of justice or charity than of 
love, for they are, essentially, or- 
ganized crowds. Individual persons 
can love and be loved; they can be 
generous and kind, forbearing, 
even brave; nations, never. A crowd 
can neither think nor feel. Think- 
ing is lonely work, dear souls, and 
feeling is the experience of the 
separate heart.” 

A close-faced man among the 


listeners made up his mind about 
something and walked away. His 
lingering image annoyed Deme- 
trios; his features would have been 
hard to swear to on a second meet- 
ing — neutral, bland, cold. 

1993, at thirteen, I was read- 
ying the scanty censored news- 
paper from Chicago for what 
emerged between the lines, with my 
father’s grim interpretations. We — 
my parents who treated me like a 
grown-up and I — we learned from 
radio and television what we were 
expected to think, so that we could 
appear to think it in the presence of 
strangers. We knew — ” 

“Look,” said Potterfield, “you 
ain’t telling no story, you’re just 
beating your gums about old 
times — who needs it?” 

“Ah, Potterfield! Once upon a 
time there were two little married 
people named Adam and Eve, and 
they had two little boys, one named 
Cain and — ” 

“Oh, shit! Forget I said any- 
thing.” 

“We knew the war would come, 
and in 1993 it came: the 24th day of 
June, 1993 — according to an old re- 
ligion which was even then rapidly 
fading, that was the day of St. John 
the Baptist, though I can’t say 
whether anyone noticed it. The 
Twenty-Minute War we call it now, 
though actually I remember seeing 
a bomb-flare over the horizon on 
the second night. It’s impossible to 
say which major division of the 
world had elected to try for suicide. 
We—” 

“Why, Christ,” said Potterfield, 
“it was the Russians.” 

“So you were told automatically 


40 


GALAXY 



by the teevy until the power went 
off. I remember a broadcast from 
South America on our car radio, 
accusing us. The battery radio soon 
ran down, then the big silence. My 
guess is that the United States 
touched off the final lunacy, but 
does it matter now? Other nations 
were almost as rotten-ripe, the 
whole society watergated — ” 

“Jesus!” Potterfield lurched to 
his feet and grabbed the handle of 
his cart. “I won’t sit around listen- 
ing to no such wickedness as that.” 
He rattled away, halting at the cor- 
ner to thrust his hand toward 
Demetrios, fingers pronged against 
the evil eye. 

Mainly for the dark-haired boy, 
Demetrios remarked: “There goes 
maybe the last American patriot.” 
One of the four laundry girls got up 
to go, but her companion checked 
her dubiously. 

Garth let his old plug clump a 
step or two nearer. “Old Potterfield 
never had no sense.” 

“Ay.” said Demetrios, “that’s 
what makes him different from you 
and me.” The woman in the 
window seemed undisturbed. “The 
bombs were for the great cities and 
launching areas. One direct hit 
obliterated Chicago, two hundred 
and fifty miles from Hesterville. 
The bombs were of the kind de- 
scribed, in the insane jargon of the 
age, as ‘clean’. This meant simply 
that they killed more people by 
impact and fire than by a poisoning 
of the atmosphere that the senders 
of the bombs might have found in- 
convenient — for they had persistent 
delusions about staying alive while 
they defended freedom or whatever 
the hell they were doing. I suppose

all through history people have 
imagined that giving horror a pretty 
name makes it no longer horror. 

“I have made up my mind. I will 
tell you how 1 acquired the name of 
Demetrios, and only that story. 
Never mind the cars, airplanes, 
bombs, ajl that trash. You’ve heard 
of it before: let it rust. And bear 
with me: in order to tell the story 
about my name I must say a little 
more about the ending of Old 
Time. 

“There were the short plagues, 
sicknesses that raged for a few days 
and passed like firestorms, leaving 
their dead. Different from the 
radiation deaths.” 

“Red Plague?” said the dark 
haired boy. 

■ “No, that came sixteen years 
later, only — let me think — thirty- 
one years ago. No, the short 
plagues — they may have come from 
the war laboratories, our own like- 
ly, torn apart and scattered. Such 
methods of warfare were supposed 
to have been discontinued much 
earlier, but that happy announce- 
ment had been made by a govern- 
ment that lied about virtually all its 
other activities, and later — this was 
before my time — later it developed 
that the Pentagon’s only concern 
was to develop gases and diseases 
that would be safe for the users to 
handle — you know, clean ways of 
destroying other people who were 
so inconsiderate as to be foreign- 
ers.” 

“Pentagon?” 

“Oh — that was the nightmare 
building in the city of Washington 
that housed the war machine — 
called, of course, the Defense De- 
partment. Yes, I think it’s likely 


the short plagues were man-made, 
but you understand, there was 
neither time nor means to study 
them when they were destroying us. 
Certainly the military mind is in- 
capable of abandoning such toys. 

“We let that mind win, by de- 
fault. We overpopulated the earth, 
spawning to the point of famine, 
exhausting natural resources with 
no restraint, no thought for future 
needs, and piling up corruption. 
Our breed grew like a tumor. The 
surgery that ended the overgrowth 
was performed, not by reason as it 
might have been, but by famine, 
pestilence, and a war of idiots.” 

Round-eyed and indignant, the 
laundry girl who wanted to go 
snatched up her basket and drag- 
ged her friend along with her. If the 
people of Nuber believed anything 
in these years, they believed that 
the King’s Republic was engaged in 
the imminent restoration of the 
United States of America and the 
Golden Age. But the other two girls 
lingered, and Garth, and a tired 
friendly-faced woman with a mark- 
et basket, and a young couple hand 
in hand who might not have been 
listening much, and the dark-hair- 
ed boy with the wolfhound. The 
dog stretched and yawned open his 
fearsome teeth, laughing with a big 
pink tongue. 

“And that surgery was presently 
aided,” said Demetrios, “by the 
sterility and birth deformities 
brought on by radiation — from 
atomic industry as well as wea- 
pons — which may pursue us for 
another thousand years, or five 
thousand, if we can last that long.” 

“I bore a mue two years ago,” 
said the woman in the window. “He 


42 


GALAXY 



had no anus. Lived a day. I ha’n’t 
conceived since. Nor tried to pre- 
vent it. My husband says it’s all 
God’s punishment on us.” 

“A woman who was like a wife to 
me long ago,” said Demetrios, 
“Elizabeth of Hartford, conceived 
a mue with a swollen eggshell skull. 
It cracked during the delivery that 
destroyed her own life. Now what 
do you imagine you did to be so 
punished, Mam?” 

“We don't know. My husband 
says it’ll all be explained with the 
coming of the Messiah, and he 
could come like anybody, you 
know. Like that Abraham. Like 
you, yourself it is.” 

"Nay-nay, I’m a rusty storyteller, 
nothing more.” 

‘‘Then get on with the story 
about your name, dear soul.” 

II 

A Music of Surviving Birds 

. For as this appalling ocean 
surrounds the verdant land, so 
in the soul of man there lies one 
insular Tahiti, full o f peace and 
joy, but encompassed by all the 
horrors of the half known life. 

— Herman Melville, 
MOBY DICK. 

y name is Demetrios. 

“My father and mother died 
within hours of each other, in coma 
following a few hours of paroxysmal 
cramps and high fever — I have no 
name for the sickness. In the un- 
canny manner of the short plagues, 

I was untouched, though death pre- 
vailed all around me and hardly 
any were left to attempt the burials. 
IVrhaps I and a few others had a 


light infection of the same thing, 
whatever it was. That’s only specu- 
lation, for science as men had 
known it was ended. Civilization 
ended with a writhing in the streets 
and a stillness. 

“Hesterville had been a town of 
about three thousand. A few weeks 
after the Twenty-Minute War I 
don’t suppose more than five hun- 
dred were left alive. Can you ima- 
gine the empty houses and the reek 
of death? A hot July: the earth 
steamed to the sun through short 
intermissions of intolerable rains — 
Christ, the rains! — but it was hot 
rain that did nothing to lighten the 
corruption it could not wash away. 
A listless, sodden, windless rain; 
the sky was bleeding water like a 
sacrifice. 

“One person left alone, as I was, 
could survive only as a slinking 
animal. Food was where you found 
it, all shadows a threat and all 
strangers. Our house where my 
parents lay dead was looted by a 
gang of half a dozen louts who ran 
through the remnants of our town 
like a twister off the plains. I es- 
caped them unseen. Later I saw a 
couple of them shot down from a 
window by someone with a repeat- 
ing rifle, who I suppose took the 
law on himself because it existed 
nowhere else; they twitched a while 
under the rain. 

“Hesterville — why, I think it’s 
under water now. Sometimes a 
dream takes me to it, a place of 
whitened bones; once, in that way, 

I found it a place of seaweed wav- 
ering, swaying over a white statue 
that stood benign but unanswering 
in the green depth — it looked like 
my mother and I would have em

braced it but the water held me 
away like impenetrable glass. 

“The day after I escaped the 
looters 1 took the road out of 
Hesterville, without a goal and 
hungry. Government, I knew, did 
not exist. You know most of the im- 
portant things at thirteen — the rest 
is comment and filling-in. Can I 
make it understandable? You and 
I, all of us, dear souls, are used to 
government of a sort here at Nuber, 
maybe too much. There’s been 
more continuity here than in most 
places, ever since the Twenty- 
Minute War and the other dis- 
asters. People preserve government 
in some form because they must. 
True anarchy’s intolerable: the 
wolves, the wild deer, don’t live in 
anarchy, they follow strict laws, 
some of them even self-imposed, 
and the law-breakers usually 
perish. Well, forty-seven years ago, 
at Hesterville and a million other 
places, government for a short 
while was wholly smashed, a gone 
mechanism. I escaped into a nearly 
silent world, but I knew that 
wherever I should encounter human 
eyes hell might be simmering be- 
hind them. 

“I walked some miles before I 
came on a car slantwise across the 
road — I’m speaking of an Old- 
Time motor vehicle, an automobile. 
Cars were no longer numerous in 
1993; the great swarm of them was 
before my time. The seventy-year 
gasoline joyride sputtered out to a 
silly finish in the 1970s; alternative 
methods were developing, and 
could have amounted to something 
in time but got off to a bad start, 
partly because the oil and automo- 
bile companies had too long pre- 


vented any rational trial and re- 
search along that line, partly be- 
cause of a general sag of energy — 1 
mean human energy. What we 
called civilization had pretty well 
worn us out ... In that stalled car 
a well-dressed man was slumped 
lifeless across the wheel and there 
was a dead baby in the rear seat. 
Sickness must have struck him 
while he drove — no mark of vio- 
lence. He may have hoped that 
being on the move would help; 
Americans used to believe that ac- 
tivity, however aimless and wrong- 
headed, must be a good in itself. 
The bodies were not convulsed. 
That had passed for my people 
also, during the coma; I think those 
two died from the same destroyer. 
Once sentient flesh, they had come 
to a certain position in time and 
space, and there ceased, with quiet 
faces. 1 took some of the food I 
found in the car. I remember a 
music of surviving birds.” 

£ 4D less them!” said the woman 

I»in the window. 

“Yes, in 1993 non-human life 
was recovering, here and there, 
from the ravages of industry. There 
was no such morning music as we 
can enjoy now, but they sang. In 
forty-seven years. Mam, I think a 
few more species have died out 
from the long-lasting poisons but 
others have survived and multi- 
plied. In our vanity we still imagine 
it’s for us they sing. I wish there 
were robins. 

“Later that day I heard a bell 
tinkle behind me when the rain was 
briefly quieting, and a boy and girl 
rode up on bicycles. They were 
fresh-faced and kind, and after a 


44 


GALAXY 



first stare, not afraid of me. The 
girl said: “We’re friends, man — 
don’t be spookered.” They were, 
and remained so. That was Laura 
Wilmot, and the boy was George 
Wilmot, her cousin. They were 
acting as advance scouts for a 
group of seven people who were 
following the leadership of a rugged 
old man, Judd Wilmot — Laura’s 
uncle, George’s father — and they 
told me as soon as they knew I was 
ulone, without any other question- 
ing, that I was one of them. 

“Their kindness broke me down. 
‘Why, cry it out!’ says Laura, and 
opened her raincoat and mine, to 
hug me. ‘What’s your name?’ 
’Adam,’ I said. ‘Well, dear Father 
Adam,’ said Laura, to make me 
laugh; and George who never said 
much was making kind noises. I 
was a small snip of thirteen just be- 
ginning a spurt of growth. George 
was nineteen I think, large and 
bland. 

“Judd Wilmot I would call a 
natural commander. He also was 
kind, in his own fashion, and pos- 
sessed organizing sense, ability to 
guide and give orders. Fanatic: an 
idea once stuck in his skull couldn’t 
he dislodged. One of these ideas 
was a conviction, heaven knows the 
source, that things must be better 
to the east of us and he would prove 
il if it meant going all the way to the 
Atlantic and jumping in. He could 
he severe, as a commander must, 
.md either he never had any sense 
of humor or it was shocked out of 
him by the horrors of the time. I 
never knew him to be mean or 
stupid or unjust. 

“There was Judd’s wife Miranda, 
soft and self-effacing, and Judd’s 


gloomy younger brother Howard 
who was Laura’s father, a widow 
named Andromache Makarios — 
she had been a neighbor of the 
Wilmots in their Kansas town — 
and Andromache’s eighteen-year- 
old son Demetrios. 

“Within a few months, by the 
way, those bicycles were as useless 
as the cars. Tires and bearings — no 
replacements. Last drop of machine 
oil — no replacement. That’s how a 
world ran down, in a clutter of 
midget failures after the large ones, 
leaving us more helpless than 
people of ancient times who never 
dreamed of an industrial age. 

“Andromache was lonely and 
passionate, perhaps always had 
been. Her husband, one of the few 
who still tried to live by farming in- 
stead of mining the exhausted earth 
for dollars, had died on the day of 
the Twenty-Minute War — of a 
heart attack. Like all who survived 
the disasters — including myself, she 
was still in shock. I remember more 
than once she fell behind, and 
halting for her we saw her just 
standing with her face uplifted to 
the rain; and Judd, or Demetrios, 
would go back to rouse her from 
the partial trance. She had not 
given up, and would not while she 
could cling to Demetrios, and 
Demetrios at eighteen understood 
that. After we became friends he 
told me he had been on the point of 
leaving home, longing to, breaking 
the chains of gossamer as he called 
it himself, a son’s necessary escape. 
His father had been well able to 
care for fey Andromache, and 
wanted him to go for his own sake; 
but now that comprehending man 
was dead, and so was the world.

“How shaH I give you an image 
of that Demetrios who was my 
friend, who seemed so marvelously 
old to me then and now would seem 
like a boy? Judd and Howard both 
commented on a likeness between 
us as strong as if we had been 
brothers, though Laura said she 
couldn’t see it. We were both dark, 
with this straight high-bridged nose 
and full underlip; maybe that’s all 
it amounted to. When 1 remember 
his face I see no image of myself, 
but another person whom I loved as 
a very separate being. 

“Andromache and 1 were uneasy 
with each other. What she felt I’ve 
never known; what I felt was a ten- 
sion that affected me like hostility 
but may have been nothing of the 
kind. Dark and small she was, and 
must have been approaching forty, 
though in her girlish slenderness 
she looked to me hardly any older 
than wonderful Demetrios. 

“I think Judd Wilmot was very 
little aware of the complex of emo- 
tions — not all of them young emo- 
tions — that swirled among us. We 
were caught up in his own fantasy 
about the eastern states — dear 
man, he’d been born in Vermont, 
though only five when his family 
moved west — because we had no 
stronger contrary notions and no 
such force of determination. Out of 
love and respect for him, we stayed 
on our good behavior in his pres- 
ence. Antique he was, prudish, al- 
most like a survival from the 19th 
Century of Old Time, or rather 
from what I imagine the 19th Cen- 
tury to have been. 

(^•p^EMETRios, before the crash, 
M "had determined to become a 


motion picture director. That 
meant the one who planned and 
managed the creation of those 
images in motion — you will have 
heard of them and I won’t stop to 
explain how photography worked, 
though I did understand it once — 
which provided a great part of the 
entertainment of 20th Century 
people. In my boyhood, motion pic- 
tures had established the possibili- 
ties of a great art form, the only one 
the industrial age originated, in 
fact the only basic inovation in the 
arts since the start of oil painting in 
the late middle ages, and the early 
working out of systems of harmony 
and counterpoint at about the same 
time. Demetrios grasped these pos- 
sibilities. He was a youth, he had 
grown up on a Kansas farm (but his 
farmer father was well-read), and 
he had seen movies mainly through 
the medium of the teevy. But still 
he sensed the vast area of dramatic 
art that had to exist behind the 
poverty of what he saw in the cor- 
rupted boob tube, and his heart 
had been set on entering that world 
of creation and liberating his own 
fresh marvels in it. He could have 
done it 1 think. 

“When I met him and made a 
hero out of him, he was not ac- 
cepting the wreck of our society as a 
final thing. Rational about every- 
thing else, he clung somehow to a 
quite irrational conviction that 
when our people restored the 
framework of society, the complex 
of mechanical production that sup- 
ported the making of motion pic- 
tures would naturally be reactivated 
along with it. He forgot (and I was 
no wiser) that the cinema was the 
only major art that depended for its 


46 


GALAXY 



existence on the sophisticated engi- 
neering of an industrial age. There 
can be great music without pianos 
or complex keyed wind instru- 
ments. Give a painter or sculptor 
his basic materials, however crude, 
and the visual arts can live. But 
Demetrios’ art had been cut at the 
roots. Understanding the creative 
side, he had scant knowledge of the 
engineering aspect — hadn’t looked 
into it yet, he told me; knowing less 
than he did, I took his word for 
that, and went along unquestion- 
ing. I see now that he probably 
knew better: it was a willful blind- 
ness. 

“Worshipping his least word, I 
was happy to fling myself into — 
well, we called them rehearsals, 
and often had the half-reluctant 
help of George and Laura. Oc- 
casionally Andromache got into 
them too, at Demetrios’ begging, 
but inevitably she conveyed an im- 
pression of humoring the child, 
allowing her sad amusement to be 
glimpsed. Like many mothers she 
loved her son, with little or no re- 
spect for him. 

“Demetrios would direct us out 
of his one-volume Shakespeare, our 
only book on that journey. He 
would storm at us and labor over 
our performance of what we barely 
understood, with fierce insistence 
on the reality of dramatic illusion. 
To him (and to me) Macbeth, Lear, 
Rosalind, Falstaff, all the glorious 
company were as real as Judd or 
George or Laura or myself; more 
real, because immortal. I still like 
lo think, dear souls, that Hamlet’s 
perplexities will be under discus- 
sion long after I’m dead. 

“So, like a company of players 


without an audience, we groped our 
way from Missouri as far as Pen- 
nsylvania — it took us two months, 
well into September, but it’s true 
we had no reason for haste — before 
anything happened to burst the 
bubble of Demetrios’ dream. May- 
be some of the intensity he brought 
to those rehearsals was appropriate 
to an earlier phase of youth; solemn 
folk, like Howard Wilmot, would 
say he should have grown up 
sooner. But if it resembled a child’s 
fantasy it was carried out with the 
prodigal passion of an adolescent 
who was in most respects a man, 
and an artist from the heart out. 

“In a way, I hold Howard Wil- 
mot to blame, yet according to his 
lights what he did was well meant. 
Judd, though I don’t think he 
would have done it himself, did 
nothing to prevent it, only stood by 
and let it happen, not under- 
standing until too late. 

“We were in a town somewhere 
near Harrisburg, a wholly deserted 
town where a soft insistent south- 
west wind was driving the rain 
down along the desolation of Main 
Street, a swarm of silver ghosts. 
The little town was all ours to do 
with as we chose; in that September 
it was still possible to find canned 
stuff in the groceries or the for- 
saken dwellings, though perhaps in 
the company of the disintegrating 
dead. In that valley town, though — 
I remember the name of it, it was 
Aberedo — everything had been left 
tidy. Perhaps the survivors of 
plagues and war had abandoned it 
in fear of flood — for a river ran 
through the place, roaring high to 
the banks — and had chosen to 
leave their bit of the world in good

order. We took refuge from the 
rain as we had done at many other 
towns, in a public building. It was a 
motion picture theatre, and it was 
Howard who suggested it. 

“We had used one before, much 
earlier, when Demetrios and I had 
explored tjie place top to bottom, 
and used the stage area for a re- 
hearsal of Othello; but this time 
Howard took it on himself to show 
Demetrios. He steered us up to the 
projection booth, and made it all 
his show — Judd was there, and 
Andromache came too, and How- 
ard lectured with the obdurate wis- 
dom of a garage mechanic. ‘This 
here is a reel, Demmy,’ he said. 
‘That there is a projector — look at 
the God-damn thing, more parts 
than a fine car.’ Howard was fed up 
with the rehearsals; they bothered 
him; they were a waste of time — 
though I don’t know what he hoped 
to do with the time saved — and I 
think he also felt that some of the 
language in Shakespeare wasn’t 
quite nice. ‘This here box that 
holds the projection lamp, see, this 
is a real special metal, built to 
stand heat. I been told the heat of 
them lamps is a caution, and they 
was pretty special too, I don’t guess 
there’d be a soul alive knows how to 
make one, supposing he had the 
makings. See, it ain’t like this, 
now, organic gardening, I mean a 
man can take a piece of land and 
grow things, but see, there ain’t no 
living to be made out of this,’ He 
was trying to be kind, or thought he 
was, and I hadn’t the courage to 
tell him to shut up. ‘See, Demmy, 
you take that reel of film for in- 
stance, you know what that film is 
made of? Plastic. You know what 


plastic is made of? It’s a p’troleum 
product. All plastics is p’troleum 
products,’ said Howard, who had 
read an article about it. ‘Thing of it 
is, Demmy, moo’n’ pictures has 
had it. Of course, so long as it’s just 
a game — ’ 

“‘Well,’ said my friend agree- 
ably, ‘I will cease my games.’ And 
he went down into the theatre, 
walking naturally, no one with him 
but me, and I felt his pain in a way 
that made it impossible for me to 
speak. Then he was hurrying to the 
door, and out in the rain, and 
running, and I ran after him, but I 
couldn’t keep up to him, I couldn’t 
make him stop by screaming to 
him, he ran out on the bridge over 
the muddy torrent of the river, and 
climbed the rail, and was gone. He 
couldn’t swim. I could; I kicked off 
my shoes and went in after him — 
hopeless of course, the current had 
wrenched him far downstream, and 
down. I must have wanted to die 
myself, or I wouldn’t have been 
foolish enough to try it; then I sup- 
pose the natural animal part of me 
was not ready to die. I remember 
catching hold of something, a tim- 
ber I guess, and forcing my way 
somehow to the bank a quarter- 
mile or so downstream, where 
George and Judd found me and 
carried me home. I wasn’t uncon- 
scious, just exhausted. I knew all 
about it when Andromache flung 
herself on me and kissed me and 
cried: ‘O Demetrios — thank God, 
Demetrios! Poor Adam’s gone 
then? Demetrios, I’m so sorry ! I 
know how you loved him, Deme- 
trios, I know.” 

I think Judd Wilmot said: “An- 
dromache, God is not mocked.”

But that was the only time he re- 
proved her, seeing that the rest of 
us had said nothing, and I don’t 
think she heard it at all. 

<<CJ HE never relinquished the il- 
Jjlusion, and from the start we 
had been used to softening every- 
thing for Andromache. It was for 
myself a kind of madness, if you 
like, to take the name of someone I 
had loved so much, and in a way 
become that person, but^-one 
grows accustomed, even to mad- 
ness. It seemed to take away noth- 
ing from the ancient part of life 
that was Hesterville; I even ima- 
gined my real mother approving of 
what I did. We came on, we 
settled here at Nuber where a work- 
ing order was already established 
and stayed together as a group for a 
short while, about six months I 
think it was, before Andromache 
died. Then Judd elected to take the 
rest on to Vermont — he never liked 
Nuber, found it godless — but I 
elected to remain here and have 
done so ever since, telling you 
stories from time to time, and earn- 
ing my living as a respectable 
janitor. 

“Andromache had one other 
trouble of the mind — more than 
one. but one that I’ll tell you about 
because it seems to be part of the 
story. She had never read books — 
lor her the teevy took the place of 
them. But some legends out of 
books had come to her, and woke 
her curious power of belief. After I 
had become Demetrios, or Deme- 
trios had become myself — I don't 
know what way I should say it — 
Andromache spoke a great deal 
about Tom Sawyer, as if he were 


someone she had known until re- 
cently; but in her mind Mark 
Twain’s great creation strayed far 
from the original, taking on quali- 
ties of Lancelot and the dead 
Demetrios and Jesus. Here at Nu- 
ber she sat about and daydreamed 
a great deal; she did not talk aloud 
to Tom Sawyer, but her expression 
would shift and change in a thou- 
sand ways as if she carried on a con- 
versation with everything but voice. 
And often she wandered away, but 
never got into trouble and always 
came back — we grew careless. She 
became interested in collecting 
herbs and would bring back basket- 
fuls of this and that, usually dande- 
lion or plantain or similar good 
harmless things, but one day she 
brought in some pure white um- 
brella-shaped mushrooms. “O my 
God!” says Judd’s wife Miranda, 
‘‘them’s Death Caps, you mustn’t 
touch them things, Andy, good 
heavens!’ ‘Oh,’ said Andromache, 
‘are they bad? Throw them out 
then,’ she said, and giggled. ‘If 
they’re bad we can’t serve them 
when Tom Sawyer comes tomor- 
row.’ And two days later she was 
talking to me in the cautious way 
She did, never looking me full in the 
face but repeatedly calling me 
Demetrios, when she became vio- 
lently sick. Why, when she was 
talking with Miranda she must 
have already eaten some death- 
caps — raw, I suppose, in the field. 

“I never thought of becoming 
Adam Freeman again. Laura hesi- 
tantly called me Adam, a day after 
Andromache died; I shook my 
head. A sweet soul, Laura. I often 
wished we were closer, but the two- 
world she had with George was an

old-fashioned kind that could make 
no room for a third. I am Deme- 
trios — aye-so, and surely, for the 
janitor of a sex-house, Demetrios is 
a better name than Adam.” 

Behind his eyes Demetrios wish- 
ed they would go. It had not been 
their kind of story — nor his, for 
that matter: it seemed to him he 
could tell dreams better than truth, 
whatever truth is. It had been 
forced from him without his con- 
scious art, by the power of memory. 
He felt the sultry breeze, and his 
own weariness. “Sir?” 

“Yes, Garth?” 

“I just wondered if you was going 
to tell us more.” 

“Nay, no more. I dreamed last 
night that I was traveling west on a 
railroad, behind a steam locomo- 
tive with a big-bellied smokestack, 
something I never saw myself ex- 
cept in pictures. Long strings of 
cars there were, pulled along paral- 
lel steel tracks, they called them 
rails. There might be rusted rem- 
nants of those rails, here and there 
in the woods — nay, no more.” 

“My aunt has the sight — you 
know? She can read too, Deme- 
trios. She’s got this dream book 
where she says it tells like all what 
them things mean. I could ask her 
to look in it about yours.” 

“She might say I ought to make 
my westward journey.” 

“Once she told me out of the 
book how you could make like true 
dreams by putting rosemary and, 
well, things, under your pillow, I 
mean I did that and there was one, 
a you-know, one of those dreams, it 
was real great.” 

“They say it’s wilderness now,” 
said the young man with the wolf- 


hound, “all the way west from Penn 
to some ocean — would that be what 
they called the Pacific, sir?” 
“Might be,” said Demetrios. 
“But since the Hudson has risen to 
become an inland sea, the Missis- 
sippi must have done the same, so 
that’s likely the ocean they mean. 
An amazing rise, you know, for so 
short a time as half a century. At 
the Nuber waterfront they tell me 
the level’s kept steady now for 
about five years. An inland sea 
would put Hesterville under water. 
Not much high ground there. 
Might be small islands.” 

B ehind him someone asked: 
"Got a license for story- 
telling?” 

The youth with the wolfhound 
stood up, murmuring reassurance 
to the rangy beast. Garth was view- 
ing the newcomer, hands firm by 
the horse’s head, his innocence 
suddenly shuttered behind blue 
eyes that looked older and dan- 
gerous. Demetrios turned his head 
without haste. The policeman had 
come softly in his moccasins, a 
stodgy decent soul known to Deme- 
trios, in the uniform of dark blue 
loincloth and shirt with embroid- 
ered gold circle, his club at his belt. 
“They want a license for it now, 
Joe?” 

“If you do it on the street. Con- 
stitutes collecting a crowd.” 

“Joe, I’ve been yarning on the 
streetcorners for at least fifteen 
years and you know it. You’ve 
stopped to listen yourself some- 
times.” Joe’s embarrassment was a 
skim of ice on a pond in early frost. 
“It’s my living, Joe, apart from 
janitor work.”

“Ain’t been on the books long, 
sir. I won’t take you in — we don’t 
want no trouble. Only you got to 
get a license before you do it again. 
See about it at the Town Hall.” 
“What does it cost?” 

Joe cleared his throat and looked 
away. “Ask’em at the Town Hall, 
ain’t my department. Let’s break it 
up, folks. No subversion. Can’t 
have no crowds on Harrow Street.” 
“Joe Park,” said the woman in 
the window, “you son of a bitch.” 
“Move on, folks. Break it up. 
We don’t want no trouble.”

T he listeners dispersed. Deme- 
trios tried to remember when 
that close-faced fellow had slipped 
away; it had been after those re- 
marks about nations, persons, 
crowds, which might stir up that 
man’s superiors — who would be at 
Inner City, he supposed. 

As a good janitor, Demetrios 
wished to be law-abiding if only the 
law would show some sense. He had 
not the inner clench, akin to de- 
spair and vanity, that squeezes the 
revolutionary’s mind. The police of 
the city-state of Nuber did not 


frighten Demetrios. He had rarely 
seen them misbehave. To be sure, 
he did not have a true worm’s-eye 
view of them. In boyhood he had 
not felt much of the understand- 
able 20th Century American hatred 
for police; his father’s shrewd and 
tranquil sense of humor had steer- 
ed him away from other excesses 
too. 

Patrolman Joe Park, duty done, 
marched away, flipping a hand to- 
ward the woman in the window to 
acknowledge her insult. Deme- 
trios rose with stiffness; quickly, 
unobtrusively, Garth’s hand aided 
him. The plowhorse snuffled at 
Demetrios’ neck. Garth muttered: 
“I hate the fucking cops, could shit 
in their beer.” From gentle Garth, 
the words startled. “One of ’em 
beat up on Frankie last week, and 
he hadn’t done nothing only pee a 
little on that statue in the Mea- 
dows, the one near the entrance, I 
guess it’s St. Franklin, with the 
spade jaw. Lots of people do — 
screw a God-damn, Frankie’s only 
twelve, they didn’t have to beat up 
on him.” 

“Brand here can’t get by that 
damn statue,” said the youth with 
the wolfhound. “I don’t think he’d 
mind the leash if I tried to stop 
him, so usually I have a shot at it 
too.” The dog wagged gratification 
at the music of his name. “I’m 
Angus Bridgeman, sir.” 

“Peace with you, Angus, yourself 
it is,” said Demetrios. “My name 
you know.” His weariness was dis- 
solving, as if the warmth of the 
young could flow into old bones 
and joints. “I suppose we’d best 
move on, in case Joe’s got eyes in 
his back. And I must get to the

Town Hall — but not today. I’ll go 
home; I’m tired. Mam, was it a 
story with enough love in it?” 
“Well, there was love in it. I’d 
ask you all in for a cup-tea, but the 
house is a mess and my man’ll soon 
be home.” 

“Another time. Bless you.” 

“And you, man Demetrios. You 
be good boys.” They moved off 
down the street. The woman’s face 
saddened as a field goes drab when 
sunlight abandons it to roving 
cloud ; she turned back to the work 
of the world. 

— Here I who write this book 
must intrude an instant — no more 
than an instant I promise you and

that this woman is no fiction — [0

indeed I stayed a day or two at her 
house on my last return to Nuber, 
and wasn't she full of peace and

“I gosemplace here,” said Garth 
at the next corner. “Then I’ll ask 
my aunt to see the book about your 
dream, Demetrios?” 

“Do, Garth,” said Demetrios, 
loving him. “And tell me.” 

“You was traveling west on a — a 
rail train.” 

“Aye-so, and it may have passed 
Aberedo, but that thought only 
nudged me like an owl’s shadow 
under the moon.” 

“I’ll see you again around and 
about.” 

“Yes, Garth, Peace.” 

“Peace, Demetrios, Mister 


Bridgeman.” Garth was gone, his 
horse’s hard steps receding with 
neat dry noise down Franklin 
Street, where bricks had replaced a 
decayed blacktop of Old Time. 
Harrow Street, with very little 
traffic of ox-carts and wagons, still 
had a usable amount of the ancient 
paving, its crumbled spots and 
frost-holes occasionally repaired, 
by order of Town Hall, with a ran- 
dom flurrup of dirt. Walking on 
with the quiet youth and his great 
gray dog. Demetrios brooded on 
the word Peace. One spoke it 
nowadays as we once said “So 
long” or “Be seeing you” — indeed 
the usage had begun long ago, 
before 1993, but in the 20th Cen- 
tury it seems to have had pious 
overtones, an assumption that only 
the religious could know the mean- 
ing of peace. Now no one gave it a 
thought, as for centuries no one 
had remembered that “Goodbye” 
derived from “God be with you!” 
But what is peace? Something more 
than the absence of strife and con- 
fusion? 

44TT AViE y° u truly been a story- 

JXteller for fifteen years? That 
is more than three-quarters of my 
lifetime.” 

“It must be about fifteen, Angus 
Bridgeman. You’re about nineteen, 
yourself it is?” 

“Next month.” 

“Live in health. Yes, so far as 
Nuber is concerned you could say I 
invented the profession of story- 
telling. The imitators flatter me — 
no, actually some are better than I 
am, I know.” 

“Isn’t that false modesty? I don’t 
think they are.” 


52

“Maybe.” The boy’s quick, al- 
most stern remark was like a*direct- 
ing tug on the arm. “There’s a 
special vanity goes with the story- 
telling profession. My father, by 
the way, gave me a life-lasting 
example of intellectual humility, a 
rare quality in a doctor. Well — one 
afternoon I was idle on a street- 
corner, full of the myths of the 
world, and it — just happened. I 
said: ‘Hear me who speak to you — ’ 
my voice sounded good to myself; 
presently I was telling the story of 
the Argonauts, with my inven- 
tions . Are you kin to that 
Simon Bridgeman who was the true 
founder of Nuber?” 

“Simon was my uncle — sixteen 
years older than my father, who 
must be close to your age, sir. My 
father was only fourteen when 
Simon was assassinated, and Simon 
governed only a bit over two years — 
isn’t that right? — before that hap- 
pened.” 

“Yes, about two years. When I 
came here with Judd’s party Simon 
Bridgeman had the new town al- 
ready organized and was accepting 
refugees. Word got around, even in 
that confusion.” 

“I first heard your storytelling 
four years ago. It was at the corner 
of Broad and Dover Streets, and I 
was fifteen. That was a July after- 
noon too but very hot; we were all 
sweating up a stink and you had 
drawn a goodsized crowd. I was 
with my father and so not free to — 
not free.” Angus’ voice was warm, 
with the plangent overtones of 
adolescence, yet Demetrios won- 
dered whether the boy might have 
tactfully steered him away from the 
subject of the Bridgeman clan — too 


important in the Inner City, rumor 
said, for Brian II and his party to 
risk conflict with them. “And that 
time too it was the story of the 
Argonauts. You held me enchant- 
ed. I was Jason.” 

“The Greeks might hardly re- 
cognize it.” 

“They won’t criticize, from 
Olympus. Are you in a hurry to get 
home, Demetrios?” 

“Ah, it’s a pleasant place with a 
dear woman in it, and I’m tired. 
But I’d always have time for you, 
Angus Bridgeman.” 

“Thank you. As a favor, may I 
look at you closely? I’ll explain. I 
am nearsighted. I can’t see the 
shape of the moon, though people 
tell me it has one — well, no hurt 
there, I can design it to my own 
fancy. It was just my good fortune I 
heard your voice when I turned into 
Harrow Street or I might have gone 
by. So let me look at you clearly, 
yourself it is — do you mind?” His 
hands came to rest lightly on 
Demetrios’ shoulders, one grasping 
Brand’s leash with only the little 
finger hooked in the loop. Brand 
also stared with wild uncompro- 
mised alertness, he who could love 
or hate in a second’s flash. Deme- 
trios felt Angus’ clean breath inches 
away and saw a broad forehead 
knitting in close regard, Angus’ 
own face open to study if the old 
man cared to search. 

It was a decisive face. Though 
unscratched by experience, nothing 
about it was amorphous or un- 
finished; the features were fault- 
less, with a healthy flush under 
clear skin. All the Bridgemans had 
big straight noses and prominent 
jaws; in Angus the look of severity 


THE COMPANY OF GLORY 


S3 



and heaviness was modified by a 
mouth that was sensitive and could 
surely be tender or humorous. His 
hands were admirable with latent 
strength; his dark red-brown hair 
fell heavy, shoulder- length, over 
the cream-white tunic. Demetrios 
could not rerrtcmber seeing him be- 
fore, with Steven Bridgeman. He 
must have been as beautiful at fif- 
teen as he was now; perhaps that 
had been one of the days when 
Demetrios had felt sourly out of 
love with the crowd, barely willing 
to look at them and wishing them 
gone as soon as he had begun to 
speak — yet he had spoken well 
enough for Angus to remember it. 
Angus took his hands away. “Let’s 
be friends.” 

“So be it, Angus.” 

B y your story, you must have 
been here when my uncle 
was murdered. Year Three it was, 
twenty-five years before I was 
born.” 

“Year Three, yes. I wasn’t in the 
market square when it happened. 
The whole community here that 
was looking to Simon Bridgeman 
for leadership — maybe a thousand 
of us all told, many more still drift- 
ing in — we were demoralized. 
There had been, you know, all the 
hopeful dreams that human beings 
nourish after they’ve survived one 
more ghastly blunder. We were go- 
ing to learn from experience at last, 
build a new world in the light of 
reason and justice, and so on; then 
the leader we like and admire is 
butchered in the public market by 
three ruffians with knives, and we 
don’t know what to do. We didn’t 
know, certainly couldn’t prove, 


who hired the assassins, or if any- 
one did. Acting on their own, said 
Brian, who had been just an ob- 
scure associate of Simon’s, his law- 
yer in fact, before the war. They 
were fanatics with a grudge, said 
Brian.” 

“There was a crowd, wasn’t 
there?” 

"Yes, a little crowd had gathered 
in the market to hear Simon speak 
and explain a new system of taxes. 
The murder was expertly done, 
Angus. Before the people really 
knew what had happened the men 
were out at the fringes and then 
gone into the woods. But you must 
know all this.” 

“Not too well. It’s ancient like a 
passage in the histories, like the 
martyrdom of Abraham that hap- 
pened when I was two years old. 
Well, not quite. After all, my father 
was there in the market and saw the 
knives. Your account agrees with 
his. So nobody stopped them, they 
just ran away.” 

“Yes, Angus.” 

“And that first Brian, who in- 
vented the label 'King’s Repub- 
lic’ — God, did he never look in a 
dictionary? — he too died before I 
was born. Died promising the re- 
storation of the United States.” 

“He just might have used a dic- 
tionary. Brian I had some intelli- 
gence, anyway shrewdness. One of 
those power-drugged blow-hards 
who say openly to their contempo- 
raries: “Look, you’re all slobs and 
I’m another, so I’m going to get 
mine.” Such fellows get credit for 
honesty and good nature though 
they seldom have a trace of either. 
The old tiresome thing of excusing 
your smell by declaring everybody 


54 


GALAXY 



stinks. It made a big part of the 
background for the 20th Century 
cult of despair.” 

“Brian II has lasted. Dictator of 
the King’s Republic all my life.” 
Angus said. (Like bat-wings at the 
edge of Demetrios’ thought moved 
the words Agent provocateur? De- 
metrios dismissed them, for good: 
this boy would not betray; to think 
he might was itself a betrayal.) 

“The wall between Inner and 
Outer Cities was raised before I was 
born, too. Till I was thirteen, every- 
thing beyond it was theory.” 
“Raised in Year Four, Angus. 
Brian I called it the reply of law and 
order to the wicked, wicked as- 
sassination of Simon Bridgeman.” 
“Aye-so? Building a wall against 
himself?” 

“We don’t actually know he 
hired the knife-men.” 

“Hm. The wall grows smaller. 
Demetrios, friend, for these last 
months, since my family has allow- 
ed me to stroll around in Outer City 
with no guard but Brand, I’ve been 
feeling — oh, like a chick fresh out 
of the shell . Can I talk to you 
like this? You don’t seem frighten- 
ed or — well, cautious, the way most 
people are with me in the Inner 
City. You’re not currying favor, nor 
measuring out the words you think 
would be good for me.” 

“We’re friends.” 

“So be it, Demetrios.’’ They 
walked on slowly together, and 
Brand too was satisfied, following 
at the side as he was trained to do, 
with respect for human legs. “My 
uncle had no private police?” 

“I think that’s true. Simon 
Bridgeman, I recall, acted like a 
man who thought he was in no phy- 


sical danger from those around 
him. Brian I — call him medieval, 
or maybe timeless; Machiavelli 
would have understood him. But 
your uncle Simon Bridgeman was 
very much a 20th Century man, 
Angus. A business man before the 
collapse, which meant he knew all 
about making enemies, fighting 
with the dirty weapons of money 
and influence but never worrying 
about a knife in the gut, because 
that very seldom happened to 20th 
Century merchant princes unless 
they went into politics. A 20th Cen- 
tury rich man, and somewhat cul- 
tured too. He saw the disaster 
coming and persuaded his rich 
neighbors — some of them were real 
stinkers, by the way — to join forces 
with him in creating an enclave for 
survival. They dug into their moun- 
tain and renamed it Mount Ever- 
lasting — a poor choice I would say, 
for isn’t it only natural that the hills 
should wear down and pass away 
like the rest of us?” 

W hy was it Nuber you came 
to, back in Year One?” 
"Judd Wilmot followed a rumor 
we heard after — after Aberedo. We 
heard a community here was suc- 
cessful, and accepting newcomers. 
The name confused us, because 
we’d also heard that Newburgh and 
other Hudson River towns had been 
demolished in the floods, especially 
one that followed a great earth- 
quake somewhere north of Albany. 
We had seen for ourselves what the 
rains were doing — flooded high- 
ways, washed-out bridges, acres of 
muddy water seething — that’s one 
reason why it took us from July into 
September just to go from Missouri 


THE COMPANY OF GLORY 


55 



to Pennsylvania. One day after 
Aberedo we met a little group like 
ourselves, only they happened to 
believe that everything had to be 
better in the west ! Dear old Judd 
was remarkably angry with them, 
and they with us. Long live differ- 
ence of opinion and its cracking of 
skulls! — well,' our quarrel with 
them wasn’t all that fierce. They 
told us how the Mohawk and the 
Hudson had overwhelmed the 
banks from the Finger Lakes to the 
sea. What Lake Ontario was doing 
nobody knew. They explained that 
Nuber was a town fresh-built 
around the nucleus of some Old- 
Time village and a fantastic under- 
ground shelter, several miles inland 
from the Old-Time city of New- 
burgh. Fresh-built by lunatics, they 
said, for God was about to destroy 
the entire northeastern United 
States. Wall Street was somehow 
involved in Jehovah’s disturbed 
emotional condition.” Angus smil- 
ed, not quite understanding. “The 
same prophecy had been made dur- 
ing the return of Halley’s comet in 
1986 — I was six years old then, if 
you can imagine it.” 

“My father remembers the rains. 
He looks older than you.” 

“Something about storytelling 
keeps me youngish. Back in those 
ugly days others got wind of Nuber. 
We arrived here as part of a crowd 
converging from several directions. 
Your uncle dealt with us and found 
room for most, being stern only 
with the ones who weren’t willing to 
work for the new city. With my 
hands, Angus, I helped to build 
Simon Bridgeman’s tower on the 
summit of Mount Everlasting, and 
later, under the monarchy — excuse 


me, the King’s Republic — I laid 
some of the stones that walled in 
(and protected) your childhood.” 
“And now you’re helping me 
across the wall. Did you know that, 
Demetrios?” 

“It’s a function of old people, 
occasionally. Sometimes their best 
reason for staying alive, though we 
do have others.” 

“I don’t think of you as old.” 
“Old enough . Well, your 
very intelligent uncle Simon Bridge- 
man probably knew the influx of 
refugees from chaos would soon 
stop — no wide communications any 
more, no large population left. 
Brian Gorman — who took the name 
Brian I after the assassination — 
why, he seemed a nobody while 
Simon lived, a dry man, nothing re- 
markable about him but a heavy 
voice that told crass jokes, piffling 
echoes of remarks that had been 
salty and original when first deliver- 
ed by Abraham Lincoln or W. C. 
Fields.” 

“What does it ever mean, calling 
someone a great man?” 

“Maybe a great man is one who 
can stay out of tune with his times 
and nevertheless make himself 
heard — for good or evil: there can 
be evil great men as well as good 
ones; history offers full pictures of 
many of them and has buried 
others in the compost of the foot- 
notes." 

“My head’s running over with 
too much, Demetrios. I’ve begun to 
detest the artificial aristocracy 1 be- 
long to. It’s without basis — isn’t it? 
Soon I suppose they’ll be calling us 
a nobility, with more flummery, 
pretense, arse-kissing.” 

"The centuries-old patterns 


56 


GALAXY 



shape up again.” 

“But meaningless, meaningless.” 
“Meanings unclear. You crave a 
meaning for life, Angus?” 

“I’ve read the books — I know 
what America was, and might have 
been — yes, yes I do. How can 
anyone not want it?” 

“We have to make our own 
meanings, not find them.” The boy 
stared at him. “Evil-directed 
souls — the power-hungry, the 
cruel, the greedy and stupid — they 
have to make their own meanings 
too: even if they imagine that God 
or the Leader has provided them 
ready-made, there is still the act of 
consent, of agreement. And 
Utopias fall fiat because they de- 
pend on the false notion that every 
person would want the imaginary 
good state if only he understood it — 
the hell he would: he wants his own 
dream-country, maybe one that in- 
cludes slavery, and whips.” 

Ami giving him too much, too 
fast? The life of Angus in the Inner 
City, Demetrios reflected, must be 
like that of one caught in the quiet 
of the eye of a hurricane. Around 
him swirled the power politics of a 
little world still in a state of shock, 
old rules and new tangled together, 
nostalgia for an age of science still 
aching in a culture of ox-team, 
spade, bow and arrow. Demetrios 
had caught glimpses of Brian II on 
the King’s rare pseudo-democratic 
appearances in Outer City and had 
been reminded of a much photo- 
graphed Italian dictator of the 
middle 20th Century whose corpse, 
when the tide turned against him, 
had been strung up to a lamp-post 
beside that of his mistress — almost 
a hundred years ago, yet here and 


there no doubt photographs still 
existed of that appropriate medie- 
val obscenity. It has often been em- 
barrassingly difficult to know what 
century one is inhabiting at any 
given time. 

“Make our own meaning . 
Demetrios, I ought not to keep you 
from home, but would you come to 
the Meadows a while? That’s a 
fairly good tavern at the edge of the 
park — might I buy you a couple of 
drinks? They keep me filthy with 
more money than I can spend, even 
on women — I don’t like buying sex 
anyhow. We could talk some 
more — sit out on the grass by 
Paddy’s Place where nobody would 
eavesdrop.” 

“Demetrios never turned down a 
drink with a friend. I know Paddy 
well, and I’ve done my storytelling 
sometimes at the thing they call a 
temple, near there. Paddy would 
have been a highwayman in Old 
Time, or a used-car salesman.” 

T hey followed Harrow Street’s 
climb into the parkland encirc- 
ling the wall that Demetrios when 
young had helped to build. On the 
other side of the wall rose Inner 
City’s terraces and graystone build- 
ings to the rounded broad summit 
of Mount Everlasting. Good drinks 
they were, in the low long tavern 
said to date from Old Time, and in 
Paddy’s frog- face as he served them 
was a polite but obvious wonder, 
what old Demetrios would be up to 
with a white-clad Bridgeman. But 
Paddy was a genteel pirate whose 
single joke was to say that he avoid- 
ed the common cold by keeping his 
snout out of other people’s busi- 
ness. No crowd infested Paddy’s 


THE COMPANY OF GLORY

lawn. Angus and Demetrios could 
nibble their cheese and drink the 
two-year-old Katskil wine in com- 
fort, watching a slow-growing storm 
pattern enlarge over the hills. The 
park known as the Meadows was 
high enough to provide a glimpse, 
through a break in the mountains, 
of the waters of the Hudson Sea. 

“Does your vision give you the 
meeting of sea and sky?” 

“Without certainty, Demetrios. 
Light speaks to me.” 

Not far away, on a more tramped 
and weedy part of the Meadows, 
stood the Temple, which might 
have been well enough named had 
any god dwelt there — the wistful in- 
vitation of a name will not fetch 
them by itself any more. It was a 
wooden block of roof about fifty 
feet by twenty, on pillars of stone — 
(people in Katskil have been heard 
to argue that the great earthquake 
north of Albany never happened) — 
and its erection had been endowed 
by an Inner City philanthropist 
about ten years ago. He felt the 
People ought to have an agreeable 
meeting-place for like folk-dancing; 
he wanted it called the Mall, and it 
was to be like the Parthenon only 
some bigger, but when the money 
ran out he allowed it could be some 
smaller so long as it was rectan- 
gular. Which it was, but on the 
entablature there marched no frieze 
of splendor and strife — just 

shingles, which look neater and call 
for maybe less upkeep. In the 20th 
Century he could have hired experts 
to go to Athens and come up with a 
genuine replica, in Permaglit and 
wired for sound: to every country its 
own idiom. 

Two groups had gathered at op- 


posite ends of the shelter, one a 
flock of mostly young people, in 
solid -color tunic and skirt and loin- 
cloth — breathing flower-petals 
clustered around a center, which 
was a bearded goor in a red robe. 
The other group was of mixed ages 
and restless, crying amens, preach- 
ed to by a harsh-voiced man in a 
gray loincloth. He had tossed his 
tunic aside. Repeatedly he placed 
his left hand on his ridgy ribs in the 
neighborhood of the heart, with 
thumb and forefinger circled, the 
other three fingers lifted, and his 
right hand spread out over the 
liver, more or less, indicating the 
carnal self — the sign of the Wheel 
and the Flesh. This was more and 
more commonly seen in Nuber, as 
the cult of Abraham grew. Some 
difficult people among the Abra- 
hamites declared that the right 
hand ought to be curved over the 
genitals instead of the liver — mak- 
ings of a possible religious war. The 
confused noise, as the two distant 
groups rather bitterly ignored each 
other in a spirit of love and for- 
giveness, reached Demetrios as 
mutter and squeak. Neither speak- 
er was very good, the Abrahamite 
too hoarse, the goor too mellow. 
“Local Agora,” said Angus. 

“Ayah, but I believe Socrates 
was detained.” 

“I almost met that goor in the 
red wrap-around, anyhow I think 
it’s Goor Johnson. I can’t make out 
his face but there couldn’t be two 
that fat, both in red monkeries. 
Senator Smith invited him to Inner 
City not long ago, a garden party, 
though I don’t think the Senator’s 
turned believer. Goor Johnson holds 
that the human spirit can’t put off 


58 


GALAXY 



(he shackles of the flesh and be- 
come one with the Unique Infinite 
unless it rejects the perverted doc- 
trine of a spherical planet.” 

“Is there a non-unique Infinite?” 
“Shit, man, can’t recall if he 
said. Anyhow the thing’s flat, 
okay? If we’d admit it we could ass- 
end to heaven right off. no sweat. 
See, it’s only sheer love for human- 
kind that keeps the goor earth- 
bound — overweight has nothing to 
do with it. He made it sound very 
attractive, but I was pervertedly 
munching maple and walnut 
cookies, and by the time I had them 
finished some other simple soul was 
crimping his transcendental ear, so 
I hitched up my shackled spirit and 
split.” 

‘‘Well, you’re not ripe for 
heaven. The other noisemaker is 
Holman Shawn, a preacher for the 
Society of Disciples, sometimes 
called Abrahamites, or Brownists.” 
“I suppose I should know more 
about them. Demetrios, has the 
proportion of freaks always been as 
high as it is in Nuber?” 

“Why, I think so. I dare say the 
proportions have always stayed 
about the same, maybe from an- 
cient times — a handful of the very 
bright, a handful of subnormal and 
idiots, a multitude of the in-be- 
Iween, and everywhere a sprinkling 
of unpredictable weirdies like pep- 
per in the stew.” Demetrios brood- 
ed, bedeviled by a familiar distress. 
During the first years of his street- 
corner activity he had occasionally 
(oid the story of the martyrdom of 
Abraham Brown, as his own sick- 
ened eyes had witnessed it — but not 
quite honestly. He had glossed over 
some of the savagery, the incorri- 


gible human darkness, and might 
have made the poor brave fanatic 
Abraham appear more than life- 
size. Well, in a way it was, but so 
are all the thinking few. Crackpot 
or no, Abraham Brown did live 
with purity of motive and courage 
in action, and he did die for what 
he was, in the manner of Christ. 
Had Demetrios’ tellings of the tale 
played a part in launching one 
more miserable messianic cult, 
which would infallibly pervert any- 
thing good in the man’s teaching 
and blow up all of it into whatever 
monstrous creation suited the 
fancies and the politics of the 
church-makers? “Dear Angus,” he 
said, “I wonder sometimes whether 
a life of quietism, or at least one of 
deliberate simplicity and very limit- 
ed action, may not be the only one 
that does no serious harm. Even 
poor Goor Johnson may have a 
glimmering of that, if he isn’t just 
in it for the money and cookies.” 
“The world stinks,” said Angus. 
The boy’s shift of mood caught 
Demetrios unprepared, as if Angus 
had tumbled into despair like one 
slipping off a narrow mountain 
trail. “It stinks. Not the world of 
course. Man. The dirty hairy ani- 
mal — but damn it, he isn’t, always. 
He doesn’t have to be — or does he? 
Cruelty, meanness, greed, sickness- 
es of mind and body, suspicion — 
Demetrios, I know a little about 
you. It’s almost a fact that I came 
looking for you — no. I’d better say. 
I’ve watched for you, hoped to see 
you again ever since I first heard 
you, four years ago. I trust you, 
Demetrios. Do you know there’s a 
stupid faction in Inner City that 
want to make a politician of me? 


THE COMPANY OF GLORY 


59 



See themselves as king-makers. 
Power stinks. O Demetrios, what 
am I to do? What is my work? The 
world doesn’t want people like 
me.” 

‘‘The world isn’t capable of 
wanting. It just blunders on. I 
know — by ‘jvorld’ you meant 
‘people at large’. Same answer. 
You will find your own art, 
Angus.” 

“How, in my ignorance? How?" 

“I‘d tell you if I could. Art of 
guidance? Leadership — teaching? I 
can tell you at least that things are 
unimportant. Love is never a thing, 
it’s a country where we can make 
journeys.” 

“Demetrios, did you see Abra- 
ham die?” 

“Yes. I can’t believe martyrdom 
ever serves. It moves us but it 
doesn’t teach. Our response to 
martyrdom is a self-indulgence. We 
remember the hemlock and the 
cross, but what have we ever done 
with the wisdom of Socrates or the 
compassion of Jesus?” 

“Will you tell me the story of 
Abraham, though?” 

“Yes. I must think about it. I’m 
tired now and disturbed.” 

“Forgive me, I’ve kept you from 
going home. Will you meet me here 
again? Tomorrow, near to noon- 
time?” 

“Tomorrow, near noon. Peace.” 

“Peace, Demetrios.”

Solitaire was Waiting 

I never know the time on a day 
when I make a friend. 

— DEMETRIOS . 


D emetrios strode slowly down 
from the park toward that sec- 
tion of Outer City’s fringe where 
Redcurtain Street occupies a slice 
of the arc, and perplexity traveled 
with him like a cloud of gnats. He 
was not what he had been before 
meeting Angus. In their talk 
neither had mentioned that police- 
man, but in Demetrios’ loneliness 
the fellow loomed large. Angus, 
who would have grown up to regard 
an Outer City policeman as one 
more underling, probably thought 
the incident a trifle. Demetrios 
himself had simply forgotten Joe 
Park in the charm of Angus’ 
presence. Past time had been clear 
before this hour just gone; now the 
present filled the horizon; yet De- 
metrios was not even certain that he 
loved the boy. 

Angus belonged to modern so- 
ciety as old Demetrios of the 20th 
Century could not. Three hours ago 
l did not know him. Faith moves no 
mountains except in the mind of 
the pious daydreamer ; love is 
stronger, not compelled like faith 
to feed on illusion — it may do so, 
true, and thus poison itself, but it 
need not. 

He turned into a dismal alley, a 
short cut to Redcurtain Street. The 
houses here had been slung to- 
gether of scrap lumber in the year 
before Simon Bridgeman’s assassi- 
nation, when refugees had begun to 
be less welcome in the city-state of 
Nuber; they stooped crazily toward 
each other like gossiping hags. 
Simon Bridgeman, son of the plas- 
tic age, never achieved a reliable 
sawmill. That was left for Brian I, 
who also understood the bow and 
arrow, pike, and tomahawk. Now-

adays we harness the streams flow- 
ing into the Hudson Sea and the 
enormous Delaware, and there’s a 
quarry beyond Mount Orlook where 
they cut good millstones. In this 
alley Demetrios looked sharp for 
foraging hogs, scattered filth, 
pariah dogs vicious as weasels, and 
drunks. Not much violent crime 
plagued Nuber in the Year 47; what 
there was lurked spider-like in 
crannies like this one. 

He walked along briskly, swing- 
ing his walnut stick, keeping it 
visible in the late shadowed day- 
light. Sometimes the old man en- 
tered such places unnecessarily, 
recognizing the foolishness of it. 
One challenges the black spider to 
jump, and afterward feels — no, not 
younger, but perhaps more alive. 

— People still dwell in the wilder- 
ness regions beyond Katskil and 
other centers, exceedingly wild but 
hardly demonic as folk imagine. 
They live there from choice. They 
could abandon their feral ways and 
accept the shelter of the city- 
states — Katskil, Moha, Penn. But 
they don t. Now I am gone again. — 

Demetrios emerged safe from his 
alley onto Redcurtain Street, where 
the police permit nothing unpleas- 
ant. High powers of Inner City have 
always favored it, and own shares 
of course; white-tunic people enjoy 
the clean sidewalks at proper hours. 
Local custom requires the burial of 
garbage in the gardens behind the 
houses, so pigs and pi-dogs are not 
drawn to scavenge. Demetrios took 
pride in the flowers and vegetables 
he raised for Mam Estelle’s estab- 
lishment, although this came under 


Janitor Work only by liberal defini- 
tion. Many houses on Redcurtain 
Street own bay windows and bal- 
conies where the girls sit on view, 
sharing these cosy promontories 
with sleeping cats. A charming 
street, at least in the Year 47. 

On the front steps of Mam Es- 
telle’s, the Professor was musing 
alone with his lute when Demetrios 
reached home. He lifted a brown 
finger in greeting, missing never a 
note of the scale passage that 
flittered up and out of the heart’s 
view like a climbing bluebird. “It’s 
been a good day,” said Demetrios. 

The Professor nodded, spilling 
from the lute more diamond-dust 
of sound. Normally one asked him 
only yes-or-no questions, since he 
was a mute. “A good warm day. I 
made a new friend, and maybe I’m 
happy.’’ A glowing arpeggio ac- 
knowledged the possibility of hap- 
piness. The Professor’s eyes were 
unfathomably soft, with gold lights. 
His skin was tan, his hair short and 
curly. Demetrios assumed his ori- 
gins were partly black, but like 
many in the city-state of Nuber he 
admitted no past. They had been 
friends for years. Often the Pro- 
fessor, when the Mam did not need 
him in the Parlor, went forth into 
the city with Demetrios; his pres- 
ence and his lute might lead the 
streetcorner tales into fresh dimen- 
sions. This, and the sharing of Soli- 
taire's bed, created bonds of kind- 
ness. 

“The girls must be getting up by 
now.” The Professor nodded, 
watching music fly away. He sel- 
dom smiled unless a south wind 
was blowing; today the wind was in 
the east. Momentarily Demetrios

observed something of Garth in the 
Professor’s luxuriant mouth, the 
tilt of his head, something of Soli- 
taire in the long grace of his 
hands — not strange that those we 
love should share traits of appear- 
ance. “I never know the time on a 
day when I make a friend.” The 
Professor found Time worth a re- 
spectful shrug. “Be with you again 
soon, paesan.” In 47 this descen- 
dant of an Italian word had joined 
the other endearments of English, 
that Mississippi of languages. 
Demetrios squeezed the Professor’s 
shoulder and entered Mam Es- 
telle’s sex-house. 

The Mam was enjoying tea in the 
company of pretty Glorie and sal- 
low Fran, casually using a squat 
pink tea set known to be genuine 
Woolworth, and lacing her own tea 
as if absent mindedly with fire from 
a jug of corn whiskey. As Babette 
crossly told her, had told her thirty 
times, she must have drunk enough 
Penn tea to float the Katskil navy — 
four cat-boats and a ketch. It was 
that time of afternoon when a pro- 
tective haze so sheltered Mam Es- 
telle that she let the house run it- 
self, which meant that Babette ran 
it. “Mam, I declare to you, yourself 
it is, I got me this extra bicep just 
from lifting the durn kettle to the 
taypot for to make you tea and tea 
and tea.” It wasn’t the tea that 
worried goodhearted Babette. 

“Take off thir’y pounds,” said 
Mam Estelle gently, “and maybe 
your arm’ll be thin enough I can 
see the bicep.” Blonde Glorie 
giggled. Fran’s lips moved, likely 
checking some passage from the 
Book of Positions. Fran was a 
gentle, serious girl; to bed her was 


like earning academic credits. 

Rugged Babette, maid-of-all- 
work here for the last ten years, 
usually got the worst of any argu- 
ment. She greeted Demetrios with 
easy affection — they balled oc- 
casionally — and said: “She’s 

through work, man Demetrios. 
Upstairs.” Estelle sighed, busy per- 
haps in the corn-spirit haze with 
work-hours and the whole rusty, 
leaky affair of living. 

A year ago Demetrios had found 
Solitaire wandering in the woods 
outside of town. She had been 
gang-raped, she said, and then had 
hidden and starved a few days. She 
could not remember who she was. 
He had brought her to the refuge of 
Mam Estelle’s, as a special case. 
She could help mind the house, 
sharing room and bed only with 
him and the Professor. She was not 
to be touched by the customers, 
otherwise all three would split. 
“Needn’t blackmail an old 
friend,” said the Mam — “I’ll love 
her myself.” 

Estelle relied on him. Who else 
would mind the fires and tend the 
garden for so small a wage, and 
entertain with stories in the Parlor 
apparently for the love of it? Where 
would she find the equal of the Pro- 
fessor, whose lute could give you 
the sound of children laughing or of 
breaking hearts? Mam Estelle had 
never been a pig for money, nor un- 
kind. Soon she did feel and show a 
tenderness of her own for Soli- 
taire — who even now remembered 
no identity for herself. Probably the 
girl’s eccentric grace was being 
memorialized in the fat locked 
book, the Diary, which Demetrios 
recognized as a vital though slow- 


62 


GALAXY 



rhythmed heart at the core of Mam 
Estelle’s existence. Mam Estelle 
was shyly proud of her Old-Time 
knack of reading and writing. No 
one else ever beheld the Diary: she 
had less vanity than most authors, 
and a better means of earning a 
living. 

Solitaire was thin and sweet and 
small, and in a thin small sweet way 
she was quite mad. 

D emetrios climbed the stairs 
and passed down the long 
upper hall, returning the lazy greet- 
ings of the girls who were getting 
ready for supper and a night’s 
work, and reached the large pleas- 
ant room at the rear of the house 
that he shared with the Professor 
and Solitaire. From this room one 
could look down on the garden and 
rejoice in its superiority to any- 
thing the neighbors had; also keep 
track of their affairs if so minded — 
sometimes he told Solitaire fly-away 
stories about them off the top of his 
head. She was sitting slumped on 
the big bed, dressed as he had ex- 
pected in the slattern rags and 
stains of the day’s work, her hair in 
a tight bun under a dust-cloth, her 
cheeks smeared. The sag of dejec- 
tion and premature age — that also 
was worn like a garment. It was 
horrifying to see her so, but Deme- 
trios knew the compensations for 
this masquerade, this protective 
show that enabled her to go mouse- 
like, unnoticed, about her labors. 
Sometimes she drew attention any- 
way, merely by a slimness and 
grace impossible to hide, but she 
was convincingly a drab slavey. 

At this moment she was lost in 
gazing at that planet which endures 


and continues beyond all our win- 
dows. She turned her dark head 
slowly as Demetrios closed the door 
behind him, and in her brown 
eyes — droop-lidded they would have 
been during the day, night-fires 
hidden — her recognition bloomed: 
a bright fish blazes out of the murk 
of a pool in suddenness and gold. 

“Solitaire was waiting for Deme- 
trios.” He had never known her to 
employ that upright pronoun 
against whose pillar-like rigidity 
most of us lean all day long and 
half the night; nor did she liberate 
the short thick blade of the other 
prodigious member of speech that 
rhymes with who. In the shelter of 
the third person Solitaire dwelt for 
her own reasons, and there she 
could be found if you loved her as 
Demetrios and the Professor loved 
her. “Solitaire has five hearts.” She 
held up spread fingers. “One to 
keep, and one the dogs ate, and one 
for Jesus, and one for Professor, 
and one for Demetrios.” But it 
would not be one of her bad nights. 

“All mine. And it’s been a good 
day,” said Demetrios again. 
“Good and bad. I made a friend; 
but on the dark side, a policeman 
has told me 1 must get a license for 
story-telling.” 

“License? Phoo-ha!” She did not 
laugh; she was quick to see the 
possibilities of ugliness. Solitaire 
feared the dark, always wanting a 
low lamp or bit of candle burning 
even when she lay snug in bed be- 
tween Demetrios and the Professor. 
She remarked once that living was 
walking in the jungle, but some- 
times there were friends. “Aye-so, 
and what will it cost, man Deme- 
trios?” 


THE COMPANY OF GLORY 


63 



“The cop wouldn’t tell me, 
though I think he knew.” Deme- 
trios sank into the luxury of his 
armchair. Solitaire smiled. A cer- 
tain ritual could not start till he was 
there, finished with the part of the 
day that took him from her. She 
never liked <his going forth and 
squandering his stories on the 
crowds for their trifling money 
when he might have stayed safe at 
home. Once on a rainy day he had 
found her at a window blessing the 
clouds. But she never told Deme- 
trios (or anyone) what to do. “I’ll 
go to the Town Hall tomorrow and 
find out.” 

She made a silver yawny sound. 
A shake of her head dismissed the 
Town Hall and the whole blot of 
nonsense where tomorrow could 
scrabble after it. She pulled the 
dustcloth from her head and tossed 
it on the floor. She was bringing a 
light table and chair to the middle 
of the room when the Professor 
came in, and she smiled at him too. 

The Professor pushed the door- 
bolt shut and sat cross-legged on 
the floor by Demetrios’ armchair. 
His lute spoke as a part of his 
limber little body, soft-mannered 
and amorous. 

Solitaire fetched her tinder- 
box — (let no one else ever use or 
touch it, or she would rage and 
weep) — and lit the candles in their 
sconces, placing them one at each 
end of the table. Then she brought, 
from a chest by the bed, a strip of 
red cloth, a pair of shears, a wash- 
cloth, a cake of soap, a basin, a 
hand-mirror. The basin she filled 
with water from the bedside pit- 
cher. 

Solitaire washed her face. 


T here must be a hundred ways 
of doing this — snorty-splash, 
flip - and - finish, grunt-and-slop, 
scrub-and-search, pinch-and-suffer 
Solitaire just took the wet cloth and 
the delicate soap — (for which 
Demetrios and the Professor paid 
high at a shop catering mostly to 
the white-tunic trade; but cost was 
barely comprehensible to Solitaire 
although she might dutifully ask 
about it; addition was a mystery, 
subtraction unknown, and money 
something that other people usually 
had) — and removed the dirt from 
face and hands. Most of it she had 
put there herself, part of the dis- 
guise. Though she worked hard 
and honestly for Mam Estelle she 
practised physical caution, mindful 
of her skin because her lovers de- 
sired it; and for its own sake too? — 
who knows? The Mam tried to limit 
her to such chores as bedmaking, 
sweeping, dusting, that would not 
expose her to soot and grease and 
stains, and Babette was usually on 
hand, ready to intervene with noisy 
competence if Solitaire needed 
help; for which reason Solitaire 
almost never wept or raged in their 
presence. 

The hand-mirror was two-sided, 
an artifact of Old Time, and fault- 
less; one side magnified, by a magic 
wholly marvelous to Solitaire. She 
loved the gidget because the Pro- 
fessor had found it.for her, he could 
not say where. She brushed her 
black hair, crackle and spark and 
gleam, with another Old-Time trea- 
sure, a brush of true plastic, airy in 
design and flimsy-light. They are 
saying, Old Time will not come 
again. 

She might have been alone.

readying herself for an evening’s 
entertainment or just observing her 
beauty as if one could do this with 
detachment. She loosened the 
slavey’s smock to her hips and 
stroked each breast — round, bud- 
immature, warmly shadowed 
around the nipple — lifting it to the 
shine of the candles. 

She cut a diamond-shaped seg- 
ment from the red cloth, examining 
it tenderly as if it might be a crea- 
ture of life, then slapped it down on 
the table and pierced it with a 
brutal thrust of the shears, so that 
the metal stood upright in the 
wood. Eyes squinted in pain, she 
spread her hands, letting them say: 
Thai's how it was — if you care how 
it was. Then quietly, a good house- 
wife, moving about in nothing but 
her coarse linsey drawers, she 
rolled the table back to the side of 
the room, the shears yet standing. 
(Some time during the night — one 
of her good nights — she would slip 
out of bed alone and finish tidying 
up, putting away the shears, drop- 
ping the pierced cloth in the waste- 
basket.) She opened the clothes 
closet, hanging up her drawers and 
contemplating her wardrobe. 

The Professor’s lute remained 
silent until she chose from less than 
a dozen costumes a long belted 
robe of dull red with yellow trim 
and fine bone buttons of creamy 
white. Demetrios and the Professor 
had pooled the earnings of more 
than a month to buy that for her. 
Of the other costumes only one was 
street wear, a suit of loose trousers 
and jacket, leaf-brown, that made 
her look, but for her way of walk- 
ing, very like a boy. The lute 
exulted. One of her good nights. 


and time for love before supper. 

She stood naked so that her 
lovers might know her with their 
eyes, her left arm underlining her 
breasts, her right hand out to warn 
that the time was not quite yet. 
Demetrios looked on the slender 
stem of legs widening to the am- 
phora of hips, torso, midnight 
triangle, and to that sudden bloom 
of rose and darkness at the summit, 
her wise sad face. Reason dwelt 
there with her madness, and both 
were Solitaire. 

The storm breeze was pushing at 
the open window. A motion of the 
Professor’s hand offered to close it, 
but Solitaire shook her head. She 
slipped on the robe leaving it open, 
warm flesh shining. She said to 
Demetrios: “Solitaire is here.” 

H e lifted her to the bed, and 
took her with the slowness and 
gentleness that were necessary. 
Over the house and the troubled 
city, beyond the homely jubilant 
toil of his body, he heard the de- 
sired rushing of wind and rain. 

It was for Solitaire to choose 
which of her lovers would enter her, 
and when. For her the storm was so 
intense and shattering — certain re- 
volting shadows gathering like wild 
dogs at the edge of a forest — that 
she could not bear it often. Deme- 
trios thought of his body as a 
protecting frame for the central 
blaze. The Professor’s lute mur- 
mured in tenderness and reassur- 
ance. Now and then during the long 
course of Demetrios’ love, Solitaire 
reached out to touch the Professor’s 
left arm, for when she did that (she 
said once) some of the force that 
guided his music through the 


THE COMPANY OF GLORY 


65 



strings flowed into her too and 
changed trouble to a singing. 

She cried out in the extremity of 
the pleasure-agony, and lay at 
peace. In a while she said — for like 
the child that she was not. Solitaire 
loved a story all the more with fre- 
quent telling, and would be dis- 
turbed if changes occurred even in 
the small words: “Demetrios will 
tell the Professor and Solitaire the 
story of Anya the Goose Girl.” 

V 

She was Good as Gold 

Some geese will believe any- 
thing. —DEMETRIOS. 

4 4 A nya was a princess of Perane- 
/\ lios long ago, when magi- 
cians outranked even kings. Kings 
might lay taxes and order heads 
chopped off, but magicians could 
make people (including kings) 
vanish in an instant. Involuntary 
vanishing was felt to be unpleasant, 
although when the thing was done 
right the subject never came back 
to describe it: the Peraneliotic 
opinion was that we’d just rather 
not disappear zzzp! like that, leav- 
ing a small gray or dirty-lavender 
vacuum which fizzed slightly and 
then itself disappeared — phsssp! 
LIKE THAT. Once in a great while 
a disappeared person did straggle 
back to Peranelios with some unac- 
ceptable tale of returning to con- 
sciousness in China or Brooklyn — 
(we know there aren’t any such 
places) — and thumbing rides home. 
If these characters got tiresome 
about their problems, a magician 
was usually sent for to redisappear 
them. 


“Magicians most often perform- 
ed this trick — teleportation isn’t 
quite the word — if they were asked 
some stupid question when they 
were trying to meditate. 

“Anya was a good princess. As a 
little girl she never talked back, re- 
membered to wash her hands, 
always pushed something better 
than the pope’s nose to the edge of 
her golden plate for the deserving 
poor. She worked at being good. 
She studied her lessons, was kind to 
dolls and pets and servants, found 
out where babies come from by ask- 
ing the cook instead of bothering 
Mama, and when the King was 
having a tantrum she said nothing 
but ‘Yes, Daddy,’ and ‘No, Daddy,’ 
and ‘Maybe, Daddy.’ She was good 
as gold. Everyone thought what a 
glorious queen she would make, 
but she had three elder brothers, all 
healthy, so that was out: nothing to 
do but marry her off to somebody 
well-connected and not too wormy. 

“As she grew from a little girl to 
an eligible princess, one thing 
troubled her. She liked being loved 
and admired — that’s human — and 
one luminary at the court just 
wouldn’t do it, the Dean of Magi- 
cians. He had a long cynical nose 
and was named Mennoc Moses, 
and by the way, nobody disappear- 
ed by Mennoc Moses ever came 
back. It preyed on Anya’s mind. 
She thought of charming the old 
brute, but this would not have been 
sincere. You can’t execute that 
kind of magician except by catch- 
ing him asleep, which her father 
wouldn’t consider; she couldn’t do 
it herself because she was good. It 
preyed on her mind, right up to the 
day when the King told her he had 


66 


GALAXY 



arranged a luscious marriage for 
her with the Prince of Pommes de 
Terre. ‘But, Daddy — ’ 

‘“1 see you mean to give me an 
argument,' said King Dagobert. 
(The current Prince of Pommes de 
Terre had massive gold and ivory 
teeth in the front of his face but 
none of his own; he was seventy- 
two, kept twelve concubines in 
stitches, and bet on the horses.) 

‘“You know I never do that, 
Daddy,’ said Princess Anya. 

‘“That’s right.’ King Dagobert 
leered. ‘You don’t, do you?’ 

“Sadly she left him planning his 
takeover of Pommes de Terre, 
which has rich deposits of bezoar 
stone, and went straight to Mennoc 
Moses. ‘My Daddy says I have to 
marry the Prince of Pommes de 
Terre.’ 

“'Do you know,’ said the Dean of 
Magicians, ‘that you interrupted 
my calculation of the orbit of the 
comet Bolowje?’ 

“‘I’m sorry. My Daddy says I 
have to marry him.’ 

“‘Who, Bolowje? He died in 
1846 .” 

“‘Pommes de Terre.” 

“‘Oh, him. I wish you’d stop pes- 
tering. And you don’t want to?’ 
‘“I'm in love with the cobbler’s 
boy.’ 

“‘So go marry him.’ 

‘“My Daddy says I have to marry 
(he Prince of Pommes de Terre.’ 
“‘Oh. go away!’ As he spoke, the 
Dean of Magicians made an occult 
motion, inadvertent we feel sure, 
which sent Princess Anya whirling 
thousands of miles — zzzp! like 
(hat — and a thousand more, while 
Mennoc Moses scratched his shiny 
skull, watching a small lavender 


vacuum on the floor fizz out — 
phssp! like that. What he had 
meant to say was ‘Vanish, O Prince 
of Whatever-it-was!’ He sighed, 
allowed himself one quick alembic, 
and went back to work. 

4t¥) R1NCESS Anya landed in Per- 
taselene — ( other side of 
China) — and the people of Pera- 
nelios lamented the loss of their 
dear princess, but not even King 
Dagobert felt up to tackling Men- 
noc Moses when he was busy. He 
was always busy. Dagobert rustled 
up a more marginal type princess 
for the Prince of Pommes de Terre, 
hoping it would blow over. 

“And Anya? Well, she came 
down phlump in a grassy field in 
that country of Peraselene where 
everything is upside down only not 
very much, and the field had a 
lovely border of summer woods, 
and a charming pond full of white, 
brown, and brindle geese, who 
whopped out of the water, gathered 
around Princess Anya, and hissed. 
‘Stop hissing,’ said Anya, ‘or I’ll 
tell your goose girl.’ 

“‘We don’t have a goose girl,’ 
said the Boss Gander. ‘The last one 
quit. Couldn’t stand the farmer’s 
wife. Nor the farmer.’ 

“‘Then I’m your goose girl until 
we can make official arrangements, 
and I tell you to stop hissing. I take 
full responsibility, because I hap- 
pen to be a princess by trade.’ 

“‘Is it all right if we graze?’ ask- 
ed the Boss Gander. 

“‘Quite all right,’ said Anya. 
‘Graze at will.’ 

“They were cheerfully grazing 
when the farmer’s wife came to in- 
vestigate. I forgot to say that the 


THE COMPANY OF GLORY 


67 



geese had honked as well as hissed, 
and that the good Princess Anya 
was wearing a fancy dirndl of cloth 
of gold or something, plus an at- 
tractive wrap-around coronet which 
the Prime Minister had given her 
that very morning, for being good. 
But the farm -wife was nearsighted 
as well as senile, and had forgotten 
her goose girl had quit. ‘Where’d 
you steal the funny clothes?’ she 
asked. ‘Why can’t you keep those 
beasts under control? Who do you 
think you are anyway?’ 

‘‘‘This costume would occasion 
no adverse comment at my original 
residence,’ said Princess Anya. 
‘The geese are quite well-behaved, 
asking only to be understood. In 
answer to your third question, I am 
Princess Anya of Peranelios, but I 
am prepared to act as your tem- 
porary goose girl, for the experience 
plus maintenance, until more ap- 
propriate arrangements can be ac- 
tivated. I expect to be in communi- 
cation with Peranelios within a 
limited space of time.’ 

‘“What you are,’ said the 
farmer’s wife, ‘is out of your head.’ 
And she warmed the back of the 
good princess with a willow switch. 
She was a woman not much open to 
reason, and Princess Anya, after 
she was done crying, could think of 
nothing to do except be good. 

“‘So it went on for some time, as 
they measure time in Paraselene, 
where the clocks are out of order as 
a result of being upside down but 
not very much. Anya had to rise be- 
fore dawn, breakfast lightly on a 
crust of dry bread with butter on it, 
a tumbler of milk, and a pork 
chop, and go take care of her geese. 
That meant keeping off foxes and 


wolves, seeing that the goslings 
never got chilled, plucking the 
down — have you ever tried plucking 
a live goose? I haven’t either — 
fighting off the farmer’s boy who 
kept saying and saying he wanted 
to marry her, and generally making 
herself useful. In winter evenings 
when the geese were penned up she 
had to read to the farmer out of 
Gibbon’s Decline and Fall, or 
Proust. He had begun both books 
when he was young; now that his 
eyes were failing he still hoped to 
finish at least one. It was a hard, 
grim life for little Anya, and often 
she felt the only friend she had was 
the Boss Gander, who loved to sit in 
the sun with her and hear tales of 
court life at Peranelios. Some geese 
will believe anything.” 

£{wt|tell, go on!” said Solitaire. 

VV “Sure. Don’t I always wait 
to be nudged at that point? Be- 
sides, 1 thought you were asleep. So 
we shall return to the court of 
Peranelios, where everything was 
getting sticky. The youngest of 
Anya’s brothers had died of 
measles, the second in age had 
turned priest, renouncing the 
throne in three languages, and 
what does the eldest son goodly 
Prince Cuthbert do but waddle off 
in full armor against the Visigoths, 
which was not only unprofitable 
but more dangerous than skiing 
and gave the cobbler’s boy ideas. 

“He was a nice kid — name was 
Hans. Princess Anya had met him 
only once, when she took her glass 
slippers to be half-soled, and they 
had sworn eternal devotion in some 
haste because she had to hurry off 
and dedicate a foundation. He was 


68 


GALAXY 



about to bring back the slippers — 
beautiful job too — on the day she 
was disappeared. He swore implac- 
able vengeance upon Mennoc 
Moses and then looked around for 
something more practical, but 
some years passed before the eldest 
son went to war and gave him at 
least the germ of an idea. He 
transmitted an offer to King Dago- 
bert (through channels) to go find 
Princess Anya and secure the suc- 
cession, in return for the usual con- 
sideration — half of the kingdom, 
and the princess. Dagobert turned 
him down flat. 

“Word came fairly soon, how- 
ever, that the Visigoths had (pre- 
dictably) done in our national hero 
Prince Cuthbert — were in fact only 
a few miles from the gates of Pera- 
nelios. Dagobert reconsidered. 
Since Mennoc Moses was busy, he 
summoned Hans the Cobbler’s Boy, 
apologized magnanimously for his 
hasty decision, and inquired if the 
offer was still open. ‘It is, your in- 
effable Majesty,’ said Hans, ‘except 
I have to make it sixty-forty now — 
inflation.” 

“‘Fifty-five forty-five?” 

“‘Sixty-forty.’ 

“‘All right already. Some of my 
blood too? Convoy of pikemen and 
elephants? Travelers’ cheques?’ 

‘‘‘No, your supernal Majesty,’ 
said Hans, who rather fancied him- 
self as a Galahad type, only prac- 
tical. ‘No, I mean to go alone, and 
simply. It will attract less attention. 
And — ’ here he really stuck his 
neck out — ‘and if I fail in my mis- 
sion, do with me whatever you will.’ 

“Dagobert reflected that after 
oil, nobody disappeared by Mennoc 
Moses ever had turned up. There 


was nothing to be done except get 
ready to make a deal with the Visi- 
goths; there never is. But he was a 
man who liked to hedge his bets 
when he could. ‘Done,’ said Dago- 
bert, and he leered. 

“Hans backed out of the Pres- 
ence, and (as a part of his implac- 
able vengeance) he hurried to Men- 
noc Moses with a proposition: ten 
per cent of his sixty per cent if 
Mennoc would just kindly undis- 
appear the Princess right now. He 
knew — smart boy — that vanished 
princesses in fairy-tales always re- 
appear. But Mennoc Moses hooted 
at him. “I could make the entire 
kingdom vanish if I was a-mind to, 
I should settle for ten per cent of 
sixty per cent? Forget it. Besides, I 
never undisappear anybody — a 
matter of principle.’ (The truth is 
he didn’t know how.) ‘But I’ll tell 
you how to find her, free for 
nothing, which is what it’s worth.’ 
“How, O fount of Supramun- 
dane wisdom, if a Cobbler’s Boy 
may so express himself?” 

“‘Why, thank you, son. Oh, you 
ravel east, west, north, and south at 
more or less the same time; then 
take a left, and a right, and go 
straight on for Peraselene — you 
can’t miss it. Must be back on the 
job now. Nice meeting you.’ 

“Hans the Cobbler’s Boy travel- 
ed off east, west, north, and south 
at more or less the same time, and 
took a left and a right, and didn’t 
notice anything that looked like 
Peraselene, so he asked a redbird: 
‘Is this the way to Peraselene, your 
Eminence?’ ‘He’s busy,’ said the 
redbird — ‘I’m Mrs. Eminence. 
Well, you should have turned right 
back along there, but if you take a

left by the schoolhouse you can’t 
miss it.’ And poor Hans had a 
number of similar experiences, un- 
til at length he encountered an 
Alien who didn't tell him he 
couldn’t miss it — just told him 
where it was. All of which took 
time, time. 

“Meanwhile back in Peranelios 
King Dagobert had what may have 
been the first bright thought of his 
long and glorious reign. He asked 
Mennoc Moses (politely, when he 
wasn’t too busy) to disappear the 
Visigoths. Which the old man did, 
with nothing worse than an irri- 
tated grumble — would have taken 
care of it sooner if he’d known that 
was what Dag wanted, and was 
there anything else on his mind? 

‘“Oh Lord no!’ says King Dago- 
bert, quitting while he was ahead. 
‘No, everything’s fabulous. Have a 
good day.’ 

<4A ND Hans, following the 

/\Alien’s instructions, came at 
last to the charming cottage of 
Anya the Goose Girl, whom he re- 
cognized at once although she had 
grown up considerably. The 
Farmer’s Wife had died of her own 
ill-nature, but the Farmer still had 
hopes of getting through Gibbon, 
and Anya the Goose Girl was read- 
ing him page 2004 of Proust at the 
very moment Hans knocked on her 
door. She had less time for the 
reading now, with the housework 
and everything, but the Farmer was 
patient, and still wanted to study 
the structure of each sentence. If 
dear Anya was a bit slow to recog- 
nize the Cobbler’s Boy it was be- 
cause her mind had to be on a lot 
of things; but then she recalled that 


he was connected with trade, and 
remembered more and more, and 
asked him: ‘Did you bring the 
slippers?’ 

“‘No, sorry, 1 forgot. But O my 
Beloved, half of my soul, I have 
come to take you back to Perane- 
lios, and for this your noble father 
will give me half of his kingdom, or 
rather sixty per cent.’ 

“‘But I can’t, possibly — darling, 
give it back to Joe, it was his to 
begin with, you know that — sorry, I 
was talking to my youngest, he’s 
going through a Phase — ’ 

“it’s all right,’ said the Farmer’s 
Boy — ‘I got the little stinkers sepa- 
rated.’ He had turned out well, by 
the way — I mean the Farmer's 
Boy — and tried hard to be a good 
husband. 

“‘Of course,’ said Anya the 
Goose Girl, ‘it was awfully nice of 
you to think of it, only you can see 
how it is.’ 

“‘Happy to have you stay for 
dinner,’ said the Farmer’s Boy. 
‘Maybe go a mite slow on the O- 
my-Beloved bit, account we're sort 
of square around the edges, mean- 
ing no offense.’ 

“‘And the felicity occasioned by 
his attendance at the prandial 
board,’ said the Farmer, ‘would 
present no less an example of re- 
ciprocally desiderated enjoyment 
than a leisured appraisal of the 
summation he might elect to offer 
of his peregrinations — ’ 

“‘He goes on like that,’ said 
Anya. ‘Stay for dinner of course — 
Hans.’ She did remember his name. 

“So Hans stayed for dinner, and 
petted the children who were still of 
leg-climbing age, admired the 
squashes and petunias, and was in- 


70 


GALAXY 



troduced to the Boss Gander, who 
bit him, and headed back to Peran- 
elios as soon as possible . Are 
you asleep?” 

“Solitaire is not asleep,” yawned 
Solitaire. “Because she knows there 
is more.” 

“And there at Peranelios Hans 
told King Dagobert the entire situ- 
ation like an honest fellow, con- 
cluding: ‘Therefore, your para- 
mount Majesty, do with me what- 
ever you will.’ King Dagobert made 
him Chancellor of the Exchequer. 

“Mennoc Moses — well, he 
drowned his troubles by marrying 
an astringent sorceress named Miss 
Givings, and they lived happily ever 
after, but the others in the story 
were a mite too young to do that. 
Are you asleep? . 

“Are you asleep? . Mm, fair 
enough.” 

S he would wake, to eat supper 
when he or the Professor 
brought it upstairs for the three of 
them. Then if the Professor’s eyes 
besought her, she would give him 
the play-acting touch of the whip 
that was one of his needs, for it was 
a part of Solitaire’s madness that 
she had learned a kindness toward 
what passes for madness in others. 
And she would then fall into the 
true sleep of night, from which she 
might rouse at midnight to put 
away those shears. Demetrios found 
it good to wait on her. Indeed a 
good life in most respects. What a 
pity — damn that policeman! — that 
anything should disturb it. 

The image of Angus Bridgeman 
walked through his mind, beautiful 
and proud, gazing down from the 
summit of youth with curiosity and 


perhaps tenderness. Rain on the 
rooftop was lashed by a returning 
storm-wind that moved again to- 
ward quiet. 

VI 

The Shards of a broken Mirror 

— and I too remember what 
never was, the Golden Age. 
—MAM ESTELLE. HER DIARY. 

D emetrios woke to the ver- 
milion and gold of sunrise. 
Solitaire had risen in the night as 
usual to tidy the room, and would 
have sat a while by the window 
letting her thoughts reach after the 
storm -wrack when the stars came 
out. Now she slept in brown arms. 
The Professor would be approach- 
ing fifty. Solitaire nineteen or 
twenty; both looked like tender 
children. 

Demetrios dressed in discreet si- 
lence and drifted down the stairs, 
refreshed. The giggles and squeals 
and running about of a work-night 
at Mam Estelle’s, the occasional 
sob or slap or outcry, seldom dis- 
turbed his rest. He had not dream- 
ed of Angus during the night hours: 
if the dreams of sleep would come 
to us at our command, who would 
ever wake? 

In the large kitchen Mam Estelle 
was enjoying the early hours. An 
Old-Time aluminum kettle sang on 
the iron top of the brick wood- 
burner — stoves, some call them. In 
47 not too many stoves could be 
found with those good cast-iron 
tops and easy-lifted lids; Mam Es- 
telle had ordered hers from the no- 
torious Salvage Company of Nupal, 


THE COMPANY OF GLORY

down the coast. “A good morning 
to you, man Demetrios!” The sage 
black cat was weaving and surging 
optimistically about Mam Estelle’s 
ankles — cupboard love perhaps, 
but Jenny took it seriously as a fine 
art. “This is early time for you, 
a’n’t it?” • 

“It is. Good morning to yourself, 
Stell.” 

Mam Estelle was never hazed in 
the mornings. While the rest of the 
house would sleep till noon after 
the erotic tumult of the night, she 
and Jenny were up and had the 
world to themselves. Loveliest time 
of day, said Estelle: only time you 
can think. Her thought poured into 
her diary, a stream determining its 
own course. 

Jenny was between litters, her 
spring output given away. Nuber 
thought highly of its cats. The big 
evil gray rats were no longer seen, 
driven out by the small dark-rufous 
ones, possibly mutants. The cats 
alone prevented the new breed from 
becoming a serious plague. 

Dealing with the Salvage Com- 
pany of Nupal gave Estelle no 
qualms. The charming kettle had 
come from there, the fine cast-iron 
skillets, most of the andirons in the 
bedroom fireplaces, and the noble 
two-level plant-stand in the sun- 
room that the customers never 
ceased to admire. In its rectangular 
upper section Mam Estelle grew 
pansies and marigolds; two tall 
healthy marawans spread up from 
the oval lower part. The stand was 
clear white without a flaw, a kind of 
porcelain nobody knows how to 
make nowadays. Demetrios and 
Estelle, having both grown up part- 
way in what folk still sometimes call 


the 20th Century, remembered the 
earlier function of these plant- 
stands, wistfully too, in the chill of 
the outhouse on winter mornings. 
Living in one century with a root- 
stub of memory in another, you 
must be mindful of the tender place 
where the graft is joined. 

The Salvage Company sends its 
mule-wagons with well-armed crews 
to just about every part of the 
known world where decaying Old- 
Time roads or the dusty new ones 
can lead them, searching out any 
kind of junk or treasure the Com- 
pany might sell for a profit. You 
hear stories about the collection 
crews stealing and watergating and 
so on. It's a dead-end trade of 
course, with that end in sight. In 47 
the Company was thinking about 
starting a foundry, with charcoal 
from the Nupal forests and ore out 
of iron mines up north abandoned 
as unprofitable in Old Time; they 
also considered swallowing some of 
the small industries growing up in 
the town of Maplestock. Mostly 
scuttlebutt — but you never know, 
about Nupal. Though included in 
the King’s Republic by the treaty of 
Maplestock in Year 21, Nupal 
cherishes a persnickety half-inde- 
pendence, and is not about to give 
Nuber the time of day unless there’s 
a dollar in it. “Town Hall,” said 
Demetrios on his way to the out- 
house — “Ech!” 

“That license thing you spoke 
about?” 

“Ayah, may the idiot who started 
it be enlightened with a dry cob. Is 
there paper out there?” 

“I trust,” said Estelle with dig- 
nity, but added more meekly: 
“Well, that paper we get from 


72 


GALAXY 



Maplestock is dreadful cheap 
stuff — it goes fast, and I did use 
some for — for writing. Notes, you 
know.” 

“Never mind, dear — in Old Time 
there was too much paper. We were 
choking on it, my father used to 
say.” 

‘‘Sit you down, Dimmy,” she 
said on his return. Jenny jumped 
into his lap and worked pointed 
toes. “I’ll do you an egg.” 

“Bless you, if it a’n’t too much 
trouble.” 

“Tsha-sha,” said Mam Estelle, 
patting his arm. She was sixty- 
five — a young mother eighteen 
years old in a Connecticut factory 
town when the world fell apart. 
“License for storytelling! I don’t 
know what way the world’s drifting. 
Some time the Inner City people 
will go too far — snooping, inter- 
fering. And tax, tax, tax!” She 
broke the egg delicately into the 
pan. In her mornings Mam Estelle 
was inclined toward a soberly revo- 
lutionary outlook, too troublesome 
to maintain later during the crawl- 
ing afternoons and evenings when 
she needed the consolations of the 
corn spirit. 

“A nice brown egg,” said Deme- 
trios, “from Somerville’s gang I ex- 
pect. Obadiah’s girls are coasting 
toward soup, Bab says.” To Deme- 
trios the chickens in the two back- 
yard flocks, under supervision of 
the peppery red rooster Somerville 
and grave gray-barred Obadiah, 
were valued acquaintances, though 
Babette had the task of caring for 
them and permitted no interfer- 
ence. Demetrios minded the cow 
Julia. 

Estelle was not so readily divert- 


ed. “Dimmy, I even wonder if it’s 
safe to keep my diary. Some fella 
comes snooping, say it’s a time 
when I don’t feel too good, maybe 
have too much tea in me. Say he 
makes off with my locked book be- 
cause some bloody new law says he 
can, and there’s me indiscreet soul 
laid bare. For the vultures. No 
respect for my gray hairs if they say 
it’s subversion — now that’s for to 
kiss my arse, truly! What’s in 
Nuber worth subverting, hanh?” 

“You a’n’t gray,” said Deme- 
trios. “Lookit your pretty brown 
hair alongit my real gray. Bring 
your tea and sit down, Estelle. Tell 
me about your locked book, if you 
want to.” 

‘‘Nay, Dimmy.” She brought 
him his tea; stooped behind him to 
kiss the top of his head, clutching 
his long, badly combed thatch. But 
she had changed her mind about 
having more tea herself, and pot- 
tered about the kitchen with need- 
less tidying — Babette kept every- 
thing in trim order. “Nay, often- 
times 1 think I want to talk about 
it, but some-way I never can. (You 
don’t want out, Jenny.) It’s just a 
book, a sort of — book. (Okay, so 
you want out.) And this is my time 
to go be with it.” But she lingered 
in the doorway of her bedroom off 
the kitchen, troubled about Deme- 
trios’ day. Her room was originally 
a kitchen store-room; she cherished 
it as a deer-mouse her nest, and no 
one except Babette was ever invited 
into it. Its one window faced east 
across the kitchen garden, and 
mornings came to her fresh and 
young. 

“Don’t apologize,” said Deme- 
trios. “I’ll wash up my plate and

stuff. You go be with your book.” 
She stood there a bit longer, 
sober-eyed, maybe longing to hear 
herself telling what stays beyond 
words — we keep trying. One sub- 
ject is love, another is loneliness. 
No language exists for either except 
a few words and fewer lucky mar- 
riages of words that reflect bits of 
truth like shards of a broken 
mirror. "Well, don’t get into 
trouble,” she said, and closed her 
door. 

T he shortest way from Redcur- 
tain Street to the Town Hall, 
the way Demetrios chose, takes you 
through Gallows Square, where you 
may see — you can’t help seeing — 
the gallows, pillory, whipping-post. 
This is the same gallows that bore 
Abraham’s wheel lashed to its 
cross-bar so that he might hang in 
the public view as a warning to 
other enemies of the State. Some 
say it was not even intended he 
should die. The dreary tenements 
and shops surrounding Gallows 
Square also date from Abraham’s 
time, squalid slattern buildings not 
redeemable by anything but the fire 
that is bound to take them sooner 
or later: what can Nuber’s bucket 
brigade do when that heap of tinder 
and dry rot catches a spark? And 
some of the people who nowadays 
lean out the windows to study the 
particulars of a fresh whipping or 
hanging must have elbowed seven- 
teen years ago for good places to 
watch Abraham on the wheel. 
Many would have died in the 
natural way of things — it isn’t a 
good-humored world just now, so 
brawls would have accounted for 
some; others would have been 


taken by smallpox, cholera, yellow 
fever. Some may have just gone 
away, leaving room for newcomers 
who would observe another dying 
Abraham with the same uneasy ex- 
citement, and perhaps stone him. 

Leaving Gallows Square you 
climb a couple of steep blocks and 
behold the Town Hall. Situated at 
the beginning of the pyramidal rise 
of Inner City, it is a fairly nasty 
hunk of architecture, a two-story 
blockhouse with a couple of fake 
pillars framing the door, the whole 
surmounted by a square bell-tower 
that would look excellent if it 
weren't twice too large for the 
building. It was built to accommo- 
date a magnificent Old-Time 
bronze bell saved from the ruin of 
some church and dating back to the 
year uh-huh. The phony pillars rise 
the full two stories; if they were real 
instead of slabs of lath and plaster, 
they could readily support the 
whacking great architrave that ain’t 
there, but since they just cling to 
the building like bandages on a 
sore knee, there’s room between 
them for a little piss-elegant porch 
called The Balcony, from which 
statesmen may address their public. 
The mess as a whole suggested to 
Demetrios a 19th Century style that 
must have been fading at the end of 
that lamented era, but left its 
mark, even in Missouri. What idiot 
revived it for the King’s Republic in 
the Year 24 Post-Holocaust when 
the Town Hall was built, may never 
be known. Never mind — that damn 
bell-tower is good. 

Squatting before its green, which 
is spacious, well-kept, and rather 
pretty with the grass regularly 
scythed, the Town Hall is one of the 


74 


GALAXY 



four entrances through the wall, 
eight feet high, that completely en- 
circles Inner City and Mount Ever- 
lasting. You go through the central 
corridor of the building and — if you 
have a pass or walk in the company 
of a citizen of Inner City — step out 
on the lovely wide avenue that runs 
all the way around just inside the 
wall: it’s called Wall Street. The 
wall itself makes a fringe around 
the base of the pyramid, approxi- 
mately twelve miles in circumfer- 
ence. Nature built the pyramid out 
of the primal rock and men put the 
knobs on it. The wall angles up and 
down and all over the place as the 
flanks of the hills demand, but the 
pyramidal shape is always evident, 
reinforced by a triangular stone 
tower at the summit of Mount Ever- 
lasting. This was built to Simon 
Bridgeman’s order because (he 
said) he wanted to watch the new 
world coming to him. It was the last 
of his brain’s creations that he saw 
completed: he never moved into 

the sumptuous apartments high up 
in the fifty-foot tower, for he was 
murdered a week after the last 
brick was tamped into place, and 
Brian I, First Dictator of the King’s 
Republic of Katskil (who liked sim- 
plified spelling because it saved 
time and was the only kind he 
knew) decreed that the tower should 
stand as an everlasting monument 
on Mount Everlasting, sacred to 
the memory of that great and good 
spirit Simon Bridgeman (deceased), 
savior of his people, prophet of the 
new world. Amen, the winds blow 
upon it, in 47 the tower apartments 
were occupied by Brian II, his 
queen and concubines, and Deme- 
trios wasn’t gosemplacing anywhere 


beyond the Town Hall this morning. 

He climbed the short rise to the 
green, only a little out of breath. 
Already the day had grown sultry, 
as though he brought with him a 
contagious sadness from Gallows 
Square. A few benches on the green 
were occupied by loafers; the police 
cleared them out at sundown and 
they drifted back in the quiet 
hours. A rag doll was lying on the 
grass — what sort of child would 
abandon a friend in that state? 
Demetrios gave it sanctuary on an 
empty bench, legs decently dis- 
posed. He saw a bland yellow bitch 
trot to the Town Hall, her hind 
quarters nudged by a zealous black 
cur who checked and mounted her 
on the front step while three lesser 
males attended; she looked patient 
and intent. A policeman came 
down the steps with a broom but 
only leaned on it. “Where do I go to 
see about a license?” 

kind of license?” 
VV“For storytelling.” 

“You must be nuts.” 

“I’m told it’s required now.” 
“Oh — ayah. Second door on the 
right, ask the sergeant.” 

Demetrios walked between the 
pasted-on pillars into the acid uri- 
nary smell of small-town virtue. 
Entering that second door he found 
the human sludge of the night gath- 
ered to wait disposal. The only 
furnishings of the narrow room 
were two eight-foot benches, a desk 
flanked by an Old-Time brass spit- 
toon, a heavy chair, a heavy ser- 
geant to sit in it. At the far end was 
a closed door painted with the word 
lutenent. Waiting were three old 
drunks, one of them a palsied crone 


THE COMPANY OF GLORY 


75 



with bloodshot lower lids who 
might already be dwelling nearly 
beyond the reach of pain, a shabby 
fortyist man mumbling to his fin- 
gers and alert against eavesdrop- 
pers, and a weedy youth with ap- 
palled eyes perhaps still high on 
marawan. All of them made Deme- 
trios think ofpatients waiting in a 
clinic — Dr. Justice is busy right 
now. The drunks would be put to 
soak in loneliness for a day or two, 
the jumpy mutterer might be any- 
thing, the youth would likely be 
turned loose with a warning unless 
his night’s enterprises had involved 
serious personal injury or water- 
gating. Demetrios had noted, over 
the years, how the city-state of 
Nuber was oddly lacking in civili- 
zation’s usual chronic resentment 
of the young. So few of them now- 
adays! — maybe Old Time ought 
not to have considered them ex- 
pendable like plastic dolls — can- 
non-fodder — vietnamable. 

Now all five, plus Demetrios 
himself, must simply wait, until 
they knew every crack in the plaster 
of these walls, every dubious lump 
of shadow in the straw and sawdust 
on the stone floor. The nasty power 
to make people wait and wait is a 
built-in feature of all bureauc- 
racies; whether the hazy autocrat at 
the summit is a monarch, an olig- 
archy, or a so-called sovereign 
people, the psychological smell of 
the waiting-room is everywhere the 
same. 

“I came to see about a license for 
storytelling — ” maybe he should 
not have addressed the desk ser- 
geant thus directly. The man went 
on writing. Demetrios had half-ex- 
pected this routine discourtesy, 


stereotype of petty authority. It was 
irritating not to be able to read the 
sergeant’s squiggles upside down: 
maybe the poor fellow was trying to 
finish a book. After more dippings 
in the inkwell his quill halted but 
was not laid aside. 

“Who’d you say you are?” 

“I am Demetrios. I’m told I need 
a license for storytelling.” 

To meet the sergeant’s sullen 
gaze was to peer down a well at 
frog-eyes. He said at last: “Can’t 
you for Christ's sake find a place to 
sit down? You have to see the lieu- 
tenant — I got nothing to do with 
licenses.” 

“What lieutenant?” 

“Like-man, we got only one on 
duty.” As a concession to stupidity, 
the desk sergeant waved his pen at 
the door in the rear. 

“When can I see Lieutenant 
Likeman?” 

“Lieutenant Brome — oh, you 
think you’re being funny?” 

"No.” 

“Don’t. Lieutenant Brome is 
busy. Wait your turn.” 

Demetrios sat by the worried 
youth. “Another warm day.” 

“No talking in here!” said the 
desk sergeant. 

The boy inched away — he hadn’t 
been talking, but what about guilt 
by association? Perhaps unseen 
Lieutenant Brome was eight feet 
tall. An hour oozed on into past 
time. 

A single gray-paned window, 
where a black blowfly zizzed a 
bumbling prayer for more light, 
faced northward unacquainted with 
the sun. The swelling warmth of the 
day collected here nevertheless, 
squeezing forth antique smells to 


76 


GALAXY 



haunt the air. For a quarter-hour 
the weedy youth practised rolling a 
marble along the back of his hand, 
catching it in the soiled cuff of his 
shirt, until the sergeant groaned: 
“Quit that, will you?” The nervous 
man mumbling at his fingers jump- 
ed as if slapped. A side-glance at 
Demetrios from the boy renewed 
their frail companionship in sin; 
behind his hand the kid amiably 
shaped immortal words: “Fuck’em 
all!” 

At last, the others disposed of, he 
was sent in to Lieutenant Brome 
and returned soon as Demetrios 
had expected, playing the leger- 
demain with his marble in plain 
sight. A sly wink for Demetrios and 
he was gone, whistling. The others 
had not returned this way: no 
doubt Lieutenant Brome’s office 
had darker exits. The desk sergeant 
sighed: “You can go in now.” 

Friday. July 19. 47. 

D to the Town Hall dreadful 
early this Morning about the 
Bloody License Thing, please sweet 
God don't let him get Cross with 
them and rar up at them in his 
Pride that’s going to get him into 
Trouble one day, he ought not to be 
plagued with that Shit and him 
getting on in years, and 1 to remem- 
ber what never was, the Golden 
Age. when I lived at No. 2 Shannon 
Street with Sam and Steven and 
Leda, and there was Marcus my 
Baby. How it was, we said All of us 
was to be his Parents and that was 
coot, why do I say it never was? 
Sam he is as plain to me now, his 
Red Hair and his Long Legs and his 
ugly nice Jaw you could hang your 
Hat on, plain as my wrinkled Hand 


holding this Pen, and there was al- 
ways Marcus, Sam's Baby and 
Mine, though Stevie was always 
Best on the Mattress but never 
Loved me near so much — Marcus 
with Curls of yellow going thisoway 
and thatoway all over his Head like 
darling Half Hoops of Gold only 
made out of Mist you would think 
when you touched them, that fine 
and soft they were, how could / 
write as if it all never was? Marcus 
he’s dead but he lived, he lived to 
be Almost Three, / was fifteen 
when I Bore him, this I know, never 
mind, it was a Golden Age. And if 
Marcus lived they all lived, Sam 
and Leda and Steven, and we had 
this House at No. 2 Shannon Street 
cheap on account of near the 
Underpass and no Ground only a 
Postage- Stamp like of Front Yard. 
Most of the Bread, well, it come 
from Steven that had this Job at the 
Shoe Factory and just took the Shit 
like Day after Day so as we could 
have the Bread, and me and Sam 
and Leda we was on Welfare they 
called it, and there was People 
made like a Profession of it, / never 
liked that. 

Sam he would have his Guitar, 
and Leda and me could sing, Steve 
said I was a Natural Alto. Often- 
times Abe Logan that had been 
Stevie's Lover and still was sort of, 
he would come stay a week or two, 
and he had a Recorder and knew a 
lot of Ancient Things that Steve 
knew too, see, they had been to- 
gether on Radio once. Things 
called Madrigles for an instance, 
and Sam could figure out Guitar 
Parts for them, you never heard no 
Thing so pretty as when we all got 
like turned on with the Madrigles.

About this reaching back, I tell my- 
self Stell, you better not reach 
back, you better not. Marcus he 
was Real-Crazy for the Madrigles 
and would go Laughing and Danc- 
ing and Strutting Around to the 
Music showing off his handsome 
little Penis which he'd just lately 
discovered it, which Sam wouldn't 
let the Doctor talk us into getting 
him Circumscribed, it was God- 
damn Foolishness Sam said, all 
they want is the Dollars. Marcus — 
well- naturally Everything was a 
new Discovery for my Marcus, you 
could say he grew up to Three 
Years Old with Singing and Danc- 
ing. Oh it was hard to wean him ! — 
his Mouth was a Kiss of Red Honey 
and the Sunshine Loved Him. 

I ieutenant Brome looked down- 
j right winsome in his apparent 
desire to soothe and please. “Sorry 
you had to wait, sir. That fool 
should have let me know you were 
here. Demetrios, isn’t it? Heard 
you once or twice. Pity about this 
license thing, but the utopia has to 
be run on certain principles, you 
understand I’m sure. Have a mara- 
wan candy? I agree, too early in the 
day; sometimes I take one though, 
strain of the job and so on. Doing 
much storytelling these days?” He 
leaned back at his desk, a bland 
face inviting Demetrios into the 
company of the shrewd who know 
how the world goes, a bit of yielding 
here, a bit of sweetening there, no 
hurt feelings, everybody happy. He 
was square and sallow, Lieutenant 
Brome, clean under the fingernails 
but a little bloated in the belly, 
soggy in the face, an athlete gone to 
slack. 


“I was storytelling before 1993.” 
‘‘Before when? — oh, that. We 
don’t talk about that, you know. 
Looking back is unutopian. Look- 
ing back, what d’you find? — noth- 
ing but the outworn ideas, Deme- 
trios: democracy instead of utopian 
law and order, monarchy instead of 
the utopian king’s republic, all that 
damned socialistic permissiveness 
instead of utopian ethics, which 
thank God the present Administra- 
tion is going to look out for, lots 
better, from here on.” Demetrios 
felt a new chill. “Thank God,” said 
the Lieutenant earnestly, “we’re be- 
ginning to learn what it means to 
run things on strictly utopian prin- 
ciples! And get rid of any damned 
subversion that shows its head.” 
But after this fervent declaration of 
politico-religious conviction. Lieu- 
tenant Brome again relaxed, a rea- 
sonable, practical fellow, watching 
Demetrios with the earnest, half- 
affectionate intentness of a fisher- 
man who sees the float jerked 
downward by the dimly seen victim. 
He went on presently: “Demetrios, 

I suppose you understand how a 
government run on utopian prin- 
ciples can’t very well put up with 
random, unregulated storytelling, 
that could undermine the very 
foundations of freedom and utopi- 
anism? Um . One great mistake 
they made in Old Time — see, how 
do you think you’re going to protect 
freedom of speech if you let just 
anybody talk the way he likes, 
umm?” And the horror of it is, he 
does not expect me to laugh, could 
not tolerate my laughter. He has 
dried up the fountains of my laugh- 
ter. Oh, if universes are infinite, 
there is one where old Demetrios 


78 


GALAXY 



has the courage to rise up, and hold 
off this manikin with his walnut 
stick long enough to piss on all his 
neatly stacked papers and wash 
them away down a stream of laugh- 
ter. And another where Brome him- 
self can see the joke, and piss off 
his own stream of laughter, wash 
the whole damned world clean with 
laughter. But the devil of it is, 
that's always some other universe, 
never the one we're stuck with, 
where there's no such laughter, 
maybe none at all .. The Lieute- 
nant had spoken some further 
words, so quietly, like a murmured 
afterthought, that Demetrios was 
obliged to ask him to repeat. “I 
said, Demetrios, the license costs 
only twenty dollars.” 

“Twenty?” 

“Twenty.” 

“Sir, that’s annihilation. As jani- 
tor of the most respected sex-house 
on Redcurtain Street, I earn four 
dollars a week — generous pay but 
not princely. As storyteller with my 
cap on the pavement, why, I can 
pick up maybe another two dollars, 
if the weather’s good and 1 go out 
five or six days. My expenses come 
close to my income. I have no sav- 
ings worth mentioning." 

“It’s a shame,” said the Lieute- 
nant. “If it was up to me I’d allow 
for such difficulties.” His face took 
on the inward-listening glaze of one 
suddenly gifted by an original in- 
sight, a shining splendor for which 
he found suitable words: “See, I 
don’t write the laws.” The luminous 
nature of this presentment led him 
to even more exalted heights: “You 
can’t make a utopia without break- 
ing eggs ... Of course in some 
cases the inevitable, uh, hardships 


can be, we might say, minimized, 
in return for — I hardly know how to 
phrase it — ” 

“How much of what?” 

“What?” 

“What have I got that would 
make it worth your while to let me 
go on as I am, doing my job, telling 
my stories, and minding my own 
fucking business?” 

“We’re very direct this morning, 
aren’t we?” said Lieutenant Brone, 
and giggled, tapping his fingers on 
the desk. 

“Is it still morning?” 

Lieutenant Brome stood up and 
stretched. He opened and closed 
the two doors of his office, glancing 
into the sergeant’s office and a side- 
corridor, apparently for listeners. 
“A man can’t help it if he’s kept 
busy,” he said mildly. “It’s about 
eleven o’clock.” He returned to his 
desk, popping another candy in his 
mouth. “Just offhand — ” nothing 
would ever be offhand with 
Brome — “how many other story- 
tellers in Nuber belong to the 
Society of Disciples?” 

The bell-tower hummed and 
roared and trembled to a music 
drumming down to the rock, eleven 
pulses of a Titan’s heart. When he 
could be heard, Demetrios said: 
“Haven’t the slightest damned 
idea.” 

“Come now, Demetrios. The 
more you fence with me the more of 
your valuable time I’ll have to 
waste. You asked what you have 
that might be worth my while. Not 
much; but for certain kinds of in- 
formation you might be, let us say, 
let off the hook — the legal hook, 
mind you. Mean to say, I’ll tell you 
frankly and freely, Demetrios, I’m

not altogether unimportant in Inner 
City.” 

“But I have almost no connec- 
tion with the other storytellers.” 
Demetrios struggled with disbelief, 
the stunned incredulity of one who 
supposed a drowsing tiger was soft 
because he looked so. “We are 
loners mostly. Artists can’t or- 
ganize, it isn’t our nature.” 

The fingers tapped; uncharitable 
eyes gazed anywhere except at 
Demetrios’ face. “The new statute 
gives me authority to inquire into 
the activities of, I quote: ‘public 
storytellers and other persons of no 
occupation . .’ How long have 
you known Jon Seberling?” 

“1 never heard of him.” 

‘‘Odd. He knows you.” The 
fingers ceased tapping and wrote in 
a black book, the expensive kind 
bound in heavy paper covers, that 
the factory over in Maplestock had 
begun to turn out in some quantity 
that year. ‘‘Mark Walton? . 
Edna McEloi?” 

“I know of Walton, though I 
never met him. I’ve heard McEloi 
sing, and tell one very unpolitical 
fairytale to an audience that was 
mostly children . Lieutenant, 
may I say that storytelling is an 
occupation?” 

“Indeed. But you are presently 
employed," stated the voice above 
the wiggling fingers, “as janitor in 
the Public Entertainment Facility 
registered under the name of ‘Mam 
Estelle’s’?” 

“Of course.” 

“Of the customers at that Fa- 
cility, what proportion are Inner 
City residents?” 

“I haven’t a notion.” 

“Indeed. Of the employees of 


that Facility, how many are mem- 
bers of the Society of Disciples?” 
“None that I know of.” But Fran 
was, and Babette had gone to one 
or two of the Disciples’ secret Love- 
Feasts. Do I get out of here in time 
to warn them? The fingers worked 
on. 

“The Mam Estelle Facility em- 
ploys male prostitutes?” 

“My recollection is that the term 
‘prostitute’ was outlawed by the 
same statute that established the 
Facilities of Redcurtain Street. The 
Facility has had no male enter- 
tainers since that became illegal 
four years ago.” 

“Throughout recorded history,” 
the Lieutenant recited above his 
busy fingers, “the Crime Against 
Nature has been illegal, recognized 
as the Devil’s best method of de- 
stroying Humanity by race suicide: 
this is Scientific Fact. It has there- 
fore, naturally, never been legal in 
Nuber.” Demetrios sat quiet. The 
Public Entertainment Facilities 
dated back to the days of Simon 
Bridgeman who had openly loved 
both women and boys. Brian I had 
not wished to disturb them, and so 
far Brian II had not dared. But 
Demetrios was being reminded that 
you don’t argue with the rewriters 
of history. “By the way, Deme- 
trios — and I wish you’d see your 
way to being a little more coopera- 
tive — do you know whether the So- 
ciety of Disciples is still renting out 
the use of its illicit hand-press?” 
“Oh — do they have one?” 

The Lieutenant sighed and put 
down his quill. Simulated geniality 
had vanished. “You spoke of it in 
your curious discourse of yesterday, 
on Harrow Street, which was, in the 


80 


GALAXY 



public interest, reported to me — by 
the way, what’s your last name? 
Can’t seem to find it anywhere in 
my records, which isn’t very nice 
for somebody.” 

“You amaze me. My last name is 
Freeman.” The Lieutenant wrote 
that down. “Yesterday, Lieutenant, 
I think I mentioned the existence of 
the hand-press in Inner City, known 
to everyone, which prints the jour- 
nal Hermes and other legally per- 
mitted material. If I mentioned the 
possibility of another press some- 
where, it was not from any personal 
knowledge of such a thing — I only 
passed on a rumor.” 

“Which can be dangerous and 
irresponsible. Well, between the 
years 33 and 43 — correct me if I'm 
wrong — you were in the habit of 
publicly giving supposedly factual 
accounts of the death of Abraham 
Brown, of foreign origin, in Gallows 
Square of this city, in the year 30. 
This is correct?” 

“1 was in Gallows Square and 
saw him die. I told of it a few times 
during those ten years, yes, at the 
request of people who wished to 
hear it.” 

“But not, at least not in public, 
for the last four years?” 

“Not in public nor in private." 

"Why not?” 

“I felt that interest in the story 
had become morbid, perhaps had 
always been so; that the actual 
truth was not welcome. Telling it 
therefore didn’t seem to be in the 
public interest.” 

“And how do you come to be the 
judge of the public interest?” 

“Every citizen is a judge of the 
public interest.” 

“Interesting,” said the Lieute- 


nant, and wrote it down, murmur- 
ing the words under his breath. 
“Isn’t it fair to assume, my dear 
Demetrios, that you have repeated 
the story very privately, say to your 
intimates, or — umm — or at the sec- 
ret meetings of the Society of Dis- 
ciples? Umm?” 

“I am not a liar. I have never at- 
tended any of their meetings, if 
they hold any. I have not recited the 
story of Abraham’s martyrdom to 
any audience since the year 43.” 
“Demetrios, you may go.” The 
Lieutenant’s flat upward stare said 
without much equivocation: Pray 
accept my gift of enough rope. 
Demetrios rose, leaning on his wal- 
nut stick. “Nay, come back a mo- 
ment, man Demetrios.” 

“You are not entitled to address 
me so.” 

“I stand corrected.” The Lieute- 
nant smiled. “Demetrios, if by any 
chance you happen to tell again the 
story of Abraham Brown according 
to your lights, with or without the 
license we mentioned, it will be 
your misfortune. I consider this a 
fair warning. Understood?” 

“Have a good day,” said Deme- 
trios, and turned his back on him. 
Perhaps the time was not remote 
when there would be a Brome dy- 
nasty, and it wouldn’t do to turn 
your back. Demetrios walked out 
past the sergeant, into the newly 
cherished presence of the sun.

weep not for me, but weep for 
yourselves and for your chil- 
dren, —LUKE, 23; 28. 

T he boy had said; “Will you 
meet me here again? Tomorrow, 
near to noontime?” So now to the 
Meadows, the lawn before Paddy’s 
Place, from which one looked 
through a break in the hills to a 
meeting of sea and sky. Am I late? 

Normal eyes could discover that 
horizon harmony; not the wide, 
nearsighted eyes of Angus Bridge- 
man. Such eyes, thought Deme- 
trios, possessed a different way of 
seeing — his own were still 20-20, 
his knowledge of defective vision 
theoretical. Am I late? The 20th 
Century had automatically assumed 
“normal” vision to be “correct", 
the one and only, a characteristic 
half-truth. And how easily the old 
technology would have given Angus 
lenses! But lens-grinding was one of 
the taken-for-granted arts not pro- 
vided for when Simon Bridgeman 
and his colleagues burrowed into 
the mountain. Normal vision would 
be a mighty convenience for Angus, 
increasing his share of safety in a 
world crawling with stealthy sha- 
dows — well, not many external sha- 
dows could be stealthy enough to 
evade the incorruptible eyes and 
nose of Brand — so yes, certainly, 
the kid ought to have glasses. Was 
not Leeuwenhoek, that distinguish- 
ed friend of Vermeer, perfecting his 
wonderworking lenses far back 
there in the 17th Century? And 
with lenses, Angus would soon 
despise and forget the special vision 
of his myopia ... Was Vermeer 
nearsighted? — no answer; truth in- 
accessible under three hundred and 


seventy-five years of historical 
sludge, including forty-seven years 
of modern barbarism and another 
two hundred when nobody noticed 
that as a painter he was rather 
good. 

But Angus couldn’t have his 
lenses. Ami late? As he stood dis- 
consolate on the lawn, a worm of 
pain stirred in the vague country of 
heart or stomach and crawled to- 
ward his gut where its transit ap- 
parently ended. He couldn’t be late 
of course. The Town Hall had shiv- 
ered to the eleventh hour of morn- 
ing during his ordeal with the Lieu- 
tenant less than an hour ago, and 
up here at the Meadows only half a 
mile away, he couldn’t have failed 
to hear the prodigious bronze bell 
declaring noon. To worry about 
lateness was senile fuss. He leaned 
against one of the fine maples bor- 
dering the lawn. Over at the 
Temple a few idlers had gathered, 
Angus not among them. 

At noon and midnight the entire 
city throbbed and ached to the full 
twelve strokes of that overwhelming 
voice. The knotty hands of the 
blind bell-ringer Blind Bailey would 
be guided to the rope by Little 
Reuben — Bailey needed no such 
guidance; it was simply one of their 
acts of love. For part of each night, 
folk said. Blind Bailey would sit 
cross-legged with the bell-rope at 
his shoulder, so that Little Reuben 
might sleep. Blind Bailey followed 
a clock in his brain as accurate as 
any mechanical marvel; to him the 
hours yielded their seconds and 
minutes with the patience of drip- 
ping icicles in the sun. 

Folk said little enough about 
what would happen when Blind 


82 


GALAXY 



Bailey died — he was old; it might 
happen any minute — and the bell 
must be rung in some efficient, up- 
to-date manner by slobs like you 
and me. Some suggested Little 
Reuben could manage by himself, 
since he wasn’t really a natural but 
merely a mite unsteady in his wits: 
it would make him happy, these 
theorists argued, to carry on Blind 
Bailey’s work. Another school of 
thought replied. Not bloody likely. 

ONE — The blow of the hour 
rolled to him over the rise of ground 
and some TWO — some white-clad 
shape simplified with distance 
crossed golden grass near the 
Temple THREE — but no hound 
strode with that man; he showed 
not the shining grace of Angus 
FOUR — Angus in fellowship with 
daylight . , . Oh, he won't FIVE — 
won't come to me. He's forgotten, 
though he, himself it is, did speak 
of SIX — of meeting, almost as if he 
loved me. And what can 1 give that 
should SEVEN — should make him 
honor such a promise? Dry cakes of 
wisdom, no wine of EIGHT— .of 
■youth to sweeten them. The prom- 
ise was made during a moment in 
the NINE — unexplored country of 
meeting. Can love be a trade? This 
I TEN — I take, this I give — what 
folly ! Love is not any Thing, but 
love [if ELEVEN — love exists] must 
be that country where we go to 
meet — to meet — TWELVE — where 
we go to meet the only saving 
mercy — 

Demetrios walked toward the 
Temple, near enough to verify once 
more what his eyes knew quite well: 
Angus was not there. Demetrios 
would have found him at once, as 
your eye cannot evade the glory of a 


cardinal sudden in the leaves. An- 
other worm of pain crept after the 
first into forgetfulness. What he 
needed was a good sneeze, a cough, 
a roll in the hay. What he needed 
was a god-damn drink. 

He entered Paddy’s Place, scan- 
ning the cool retreat, the bar, the 
little booths, open tables on the 
floor’s fresh sawdust, instantly re- 
cording the already known sadness: 
Angus isn’t here. Paddy, wiping the 
bar, observed him with politely 
silent curiosity, his smile a modest 
widening of the frog mouth — you 
expected it to open at sight of a 
penny-insect with the zip of a light- 
ning tongue. 

A pair of nondescript men, trav- 
elers likely, overnight guests, were 
eating lunch or late breakfast in a 
booth, where they chewed on some 
private subject in undertones. 
Paddy’s Place was the most pros- 
perous hostel in Outer City, located 
on what in 47 was already being 
called the Long Road. It comes 
from somewhere in the north, 
passing through Maplestock and 
Kingstone, touching Nuber at the 
Meadows, angling down into the 
city under the name of Main Street, 
and proceeding southward through 
wilderness to Sofran. There it must 
bear west, away from the areas of 
desolation, and so into Penn, which 
they say is a republic, though not a 
King’s Republic. The only other 
customer in the bar was an old 
fellow beginning a deep soak in 
Paddy’s beer. “A good day, 
Paddy,” Demetrios said, and raised 
his foot to the comfort of the rail. 
“If you know something good 
about it.” 

“Why, the sun shines, man

Demetrios — oyah, I mean it would 
if I’d persuade me new slut to wash 
the windows. What’ll it be?” 
“Shines from force of habit, man 
Paddy, like the joe who couldn’t 
stop grinning when they cut his 
head off because it made him forget 
what the joRe was. Corn spirit, 
Paddy, I need a touch of corn 
spirit.” 

Paddy reached for the jug. 
“You’re dark blue today, yourself it 
is. The way I heard it, he couldn’t 
tell them the joke because he was 
short of breath. But things look 
nice after the rain.” 

“The tears of Jesus on Calvary. 
The pee of Zeus. The floods of Old 
Time at Aberedo.” 

“Oyah.” Paddy resumed his day- 
long wiping of the bar. “Aberedo?” 
“A town in Penn, where I 
stopped once.” Demetrios drank, 
pushing his coin about in a puddle 
from the bottom of the glass. 
“Maybe you was never there.” 
“Nor heard of it.” 

“Refill, dear soul. I’ll drink slow, 
trouble you no more.” 

“No trouble, sir.” 

“Sirring me, you Irish monster? 
Why, old Quixote’s armor is scat- 
tering rust like red dandruff. Time, 
mind you, is not the only cause of 
it: the fella was born old.” The 
(other) old drinker was deep-sunk 
in his beer dream. Older than 
Demetrios, he too would have been 
born in the age of plastic and sub- 
sidized corruption: maybe the 
dragons, magicians, imperilled 
beauties of his fantasy were power- 
ed by internal combustion, wore 
white lab coats and garments by 
Saks 5th Avenue. The travelers, 
done with their conference, sat 


heavy with digestion, picking their 
teeth with splinters — why, by night- 
fall, if they had good horses, they 
could be twenty or thirty miles from 
Nuber — 


S o, demetrios! You could have 
wandered away from Nuber any 
time in the last forty-odd years, but 
always found some reason why 
not — maybe sprouting from a de- 
lusion that there's really no world 
beyond it. To leave it is to enter a 
mist. But there were substantial 
reasons. There was Elizabeth of 
Hartford, sweet none-too- bright 
Elizabeth who was like a wife or 
better for eight years after George 
and Laura moved away, until she 
died giving birth to the big-skulled 
mue which also, by one of the oc- 
casional mercies of nature, could 
not live. There was the Orgy De- 
cade. the Twenties, my thirties, 
aftermath of the Red Plague when 
nearly everyone in Nuber believed 
the end of the human race was at 
hand — but this time really-tmly, as 
it always has been of course — and 
so one might as well try and try for 
some new way of touching off an 
explosion in the genitals, calling 
this action Life as if other happen- 
ings were something less than life. 
But the nen’ous system can shudder 
only just so much, so what else is 
going? Why, to us in the Year 30 
the prophet Abraham came from 
another country, Abraham who be- 
lieved like other holy men of other 
ancient times, that something he 
called the love of something he 
called God was bigger than either 
the dollar or the orgasm. I don't 
know. You can't spend an abstrac- 


84 


GALAXY 



don to buy you bread. You can't 
love an abstraction, but only other 
individual human persons — love di- 
rected elsewhere ceases to deserve 
the name, and may become poison 
or nonsense, or perhaps a kind of 
mental masturbation that can’t 
come. Anyhow they butchered him. 

Why could you not be here. 
Angus? Your nearness alone might 
almost content me, even if you 
never desired to touch me. But your 
absence is a thorn in the heart that 
teaches me I love you. 

The prophet Abraham came from 
another country — 

Demetrios pushed coin and 
empty glass away, and let his 
walnut stick thump the sawdust as 
he made for the door. He nodded to 
those travelers, who lifted their 
mugs amiably, guessing perhaps 
that Demetrios understood country 
roads and open skies. “Have a good 
day, all,” he said, and stepped into 
a wave of sunlight, which trans- 
figured the Temple and its shingled 
entablature so that it did seem a 
fantasy-glimpse of the Parthenon in 
the shade of Mount Everlasting. 

He strode down to it, his eye 
(professional though a mite drunk) 
assessing the crowd. Mostly young 
or youngish; no babies prepared to 
let fly with howls in the midst of 
dramatic passages. Another white- 
clad man was coming down the 
avenue that curved from the south- 
east gate of Inner City, the route 
that Angus would probably use. 
But it wasn’t Angus. Just another 
stranger who, as Demetrios halted 
to observe, unobtrusively spoke to 
the handful of others in the crowd 
who wore the white tunics. And 
then by ones and twos, with too 


much unconcern, they were drifting 
back up the avenue to that south- 
east gate, the careful messenger 
being the last to depart. Something 
is happening in the Inner City. 
Where A ngus lives. News will trickle 
down to us in time, whatever we are

Smoldering grief at the boy’s ab- 
sence, smoldering wrath at Lieu- 
tenant Brome, at the law which is 
an ass, mixed with the corn spirit 
and the morose sultriness of July. A 
few eyes in the placid crowd were 
already asking: Will the old boy 
give us a tale? 

He rested his back against a 
pillar of the Temple, his bones 
familiar with every bump of the 
bricks. Two weeks ago he had 
lounged here giving them Hans 
Andersen’s Little Mermaid as it 
came through the lens of his 
memory. “Demetrios, if by any 
chance you happen to tell again the

iitell how the prophet Abra- 
ham came from another country. 

“He was born, dear souls, in a 
town named Bethel in the state of 
Maryland. This was in 1988, five 
years before the Destruction. Of 
Bethel he remembered only the 
name and random childhood 
images, for his family moved to 
Ohio and he was there, a child of 
five, when one of the bombs re- 
moved the city of Washington from 
history. These things he told me in 
a quiet conversation, the day before 
he was betrayed.

“Abraham was not hard to talk 
to. We chatted comfortably, as 
might any two men with a few com- 
mon interests. He did not condemn 
my agnosticism though his mind 
would not allow him to understand 
it. He was a man of middling 
height, with reddish beard and 
sandy hair worn shoulder-length. 
Blue-eyed he was, simple of speech, 
and it seemed to me most of his 
followers had acquired traces of his 
simplicity. They were a little army 
of fifty saints, the majority of them 
children. Painted on their white 
tunics they displayed the symbol of 
a wheel crossed out by two strokes, 
to express their belief that God had 
declared against all mechanism. No 
more machinery, said Abraham, 
who felt that God spoke through 
him. No more use of meat, leather, 
milk, eggs, no more subjection or 
destruction of other living beings. 
The idea is older than Buddha and 
newer than tomorrow. If people 
must travel, Abraham said, let 
them walk, as these children had 
walked with him into the northern 
wilderness and then south toNuber. 
He also proposed to transform 
Nuber into the New Jerusalem. 

“I met that band of the faithful 
in the orchard of one Cecil Mason, 
since deceased, who had allowed 
them the use of it for a campsite 
after they were admitted through 
the border posts into Outer City. 
The orchard is still maintained by 
the son of Cecil: you can be shown 
the spot where Abraham’s tent was 
raised. That is the spot where the 
disciple Jude brought the police of 
Nuber, and in their presence ac- 
cused the prophet of planning the 
overthrow of the state. I had talked 


a little with Jude also, that day in 
the orchard. He was then a man in- 
wardly ravaged, though I did not 
then understand the cause — nor do 
1 now. But I think he acted, not as 
some say out of greed for tainted 
money, but from a desire to arrest 
the world's attention, even its com- 
passion, by acting the part of the 
chief of sinners: to become the most 
hated scapegoat, to take on the 
load of sin by sinning to the utter- 
most, to reject the wine of life and 
choke to death on a mouthful of 
ordure, as a way of saying: ‘Behold, 
O Lord, what I have done for 
Thee!’ 

“I spoke too with the disciple 
Mathias of Gran Gor, who believed 
Abraham had healed him of the 
smallpox by a laying on of hands, 
and believed also that Abraham 
was the second incarnation of Jesus 
Christ, only begotten son of God, 
returned after two thousand years 
to save the world. Mathias was even 
then contemplating the task of writ- 
ing down the story of Abraham’s 
life on earth. He may be engaged in 
this now: he left Nuber after the 
martyrdom and I don’t know what 
became of him, nor whether he be- 
lieves the world has been saved. 

“Abraham earned his living as a 
carpenter up to the twenty-eighth 
year of his life. This was in some 
fairly large settlement of survivors 
in Ohio; he never told me the name 
of it. He said those were years when 
his enlightenment strove with his 
folly, until at length it was clear to 
him that God and the Devil were 
battling for his soul. Then into the 
wilderness went Abraham alone 
and naked by God’s command, and 
wove himself garments of grass.

sandals of grass with soles of wood 
carved by the knife that was his 
only tool and that had never drawn 
blood. In a clearing of the forest he 
made a shelter and a garden suffi- 
cient for his needs. I have heard the 
fairytale about the fox who guided 
him to edible plants and berries 
and mushrooms, but Preacher Ab- 
raham himself told me no such 
nonsense. He knew and loved ani- 
mals too much to falsify them, and 
because he was quiet, slow-moving, 
harmless, they came to him. I was 
not surprised that he knew the 
legend of St. Francis of Assisi and 
called St. Francis ‘my brother’ — 
and to me at least he never made 
any claim of supernatural origin. I 
think his one concern was to tell 
people how he thought they might 
live so as to be at peace with them- 
selves and pleasing to the God in 
whom he believed ... He lived 
three years in that shelter in the 
forest, and was joined by the dis- 
ciple whose name was John, by an- 
other who took the name of Simon, 
and in the third year, by Jude.”

awav from Demetrios for my Mam

there's more than one way to skin 
the ecology. The most learned defi- 
nition I can find for the word “ im-

whatever won t work because we 
can't be bothered.” It would be 
practical to live by Abraham 's prin- 
ciples. though maybe tedious, if we 
were mostly Abrahams instead of 
protein- hungry, rumpleheaded sex-

Cousin Jasper who. when too young 
to be quoted, did manfully enjoy 
himself behind the barn with that 


precocious Lily Littlejohn from

ing either — Jas had ripped off a 
hunk of mince pie which they di- 
vided, and that little fiend Lily had

up a Pint of Peach Pserve. I made it 
myself, the Pserve, they All liked it. 

I was caught by half the Floor 
falling in onto me, one of the Tim- 
bers pinned my Leg that it took me 
an hour or two to fight my Way 
Loose. See, I knowed the leg was 
not Broke, something was holding 
up the Timber a couple-three 
inches, but I couldn't get free till I 
was able to tear loose a stick that 
had splintered off of Something, 
and pry up the Timber a bit so as I 
could inch out. There was Cobwebs

44A T THE c * ose °f those three years 
Abraham set forth with his 
disciples to preach the life of sim- 
plicity. One would think that in the 
aftermath of 1993 human beings 
should have been ready for it. It did 
not prove so. A generation had 
passed — thirty years including the 
time of the Red Plague. Men and 
women in their twenties had no 
personal recollection of the world 
as it had been, and small faith in 
their shattered elders’ talk about it. 
People, old and young, wished to 
live — why, more or less as people 
always have done: blundering, 

credulous, self-obsessed; half-edu- 
cated monkeys with scant thought 
for the morrow and none for the 
past. (Aren’t we like that, dear 
souls? — it’s hard, tiring work being 
any more human than that.) When 
Abraham preached, most listeners 
stared, muttered, walked away. A 
few exceptions became loyal 
followers.

“Abraham found most of his 
listeners were children. If he asked 
himself why, he gave himself only 
the truistic answers — they were in- 
nocent, open-minded, and so on. 

“He traveled north through Penn 
into the nation we now call Moha, 
and crossed the Hudson Sea with 
his company on makeshift rafts — 
there was no reliable ferry in those 
days south of Ticonderoga — into 
what we once called New England. 
He won many more followers there. 
Everywhere in that land* he told 
me, he found small communities 
holding together, some declining, 
but a few almost prospering in the 
ancient manner of self-reliance so 
emotionally despised by self-ador- 
ing intellectuals in the sad latter 
days of Old Time. But the children 
who slipped away from their fami- 
lies to join him, often following sec- 
retly through the woods until they 
were too far from home to be sent 
back, were not all recruited from 
the bored and discontented; many 
had the true flush of faith — I saw it 
myself. Abraham soon gave up try- 
ing to send the children home, and 
accepted their devotion as a mani- 
festation of God’s will. They came 
to be called Abraham’s Army, or 
the Roving Ragamuffins, or the 
Children’s Crusade. Weak small 
settlements feared their approach 
because they had to eat. They were 
never thieving, nor disorderly, nor 
violent. Before the troubles they en- 
countered on Adirondack Island 
and south of there, they numbered 
over two hundred. 

“The disciple Andrew remained 
behind in Moha to find a site for 
the New Jerusalem. There was good 
country available everywhere, going 


back to wilderness; but when An- 
drew rejoined Abraham in the 
north he also described the city of 
Nuber, and the prophet turned 
south with our city for his goal — 
guided, he told me, by God's voice 
in a dream. 

“He came in the fall of the year, 
close on the day we celebrate as the 
Day of Forthcoming, that day when 
Simon Bridgeman’s people left their 
refuge in the mountain and learned 
the earth had not been altogether 
destroyed. Nuber, unlike other 
towns, had prepared itself with fear 
and resentment against Abraham’s 
appearance. One Cephas in par- 
ticular, who was Master of the Car- 
penters’ Guild, had alarmed the 
people with accounts of Abraham’s 
preaching; and he had found an 
ancient oaken wagon wheel, and 
declared that Abraham ought to 
swing from it in Gallows Square, 
for threatening to upset the utopia. 
‘He has crossed out the wheel over 
his heart,’ said Cephas — ‘let him 
take it on his back, and let us see if 
it will roll him into the New Jeru- 
salem.’ 

“Abraham’s legend had grown, 
dear souls. His horde of hungry 
children — they were only fifty, after 
an encounter with smallpox at 
Gran Gor — was dreaded like a 
plague of grasshoppers; but that’s 
no full explanation of what happen- 
ed. Why was Christ hated, who 
harmed no one? Why do we de- 
mand his crucifixion again, and 
again? Can it be, dear souls, be- 
cause he said, Love thy neigh- 
bor — ? Pilate found no fault in 
Jesus, but yielded to the clamor and 
gave him to the mob. Abraham, 
true, was officially sentenced by the 


THE COMPANY OF GLORY 


89 



magistrate at the Town Hall, to one 
hour of public discipline as an 
enemy of the State; yet Judge 
Bruecke says to this day that he had 
no thought of condemning Abra- 
ham to death. He intended the 
fellow should spend an hour in the 
pillory, no more — and even that, he 
says, was simply in order to quiet 
the public unrest. 

“Oh, let folk argue it as they 
argue the thoughts of Pilate, or the 
thoughts of the archons of Athens. 
The disciple Jude did bring the 
officers of the police to the orchard, 
and stood outside Abraham’s tent 
and called to him. And when Abra- 
ham came out Jude kissed his fore- 
head saying, “O my Master!’ then 
the sergeant of police asked: ‘Is this 
the man who declares the city must 
be destroyed so that another may 
be built?’ 

Jude said, ‘It is he.’” 

Demetrios saw new faces at the 
Temple, a few. More stragglers 
were crossing the grass of the Mea- 
dows, among them two men in the 
uniform of the police. Some dis- 
tance away, but advancing more 
quickly when he noticed the crowd, 
a boy or young man in a green 
shirt. Not Angus, too heavy-set. 
Garth? Garth ought to be working 
at the stable. Maybe he had a long 
noon hour. It was Garth. Warn 
him somehow. 

“And they took Abraham before 
the Magistrate, who questioned 
him — speaking reasonably, I’m 
told, even going so far as to explain 
to Abraham why the State found it 
necessary to chastise him if he 
would not admit himself in error. 
Abraham stood silent. 

“And when he was being taken 


from the Town Hall a crowd led by 
Cephas seized him from the police, 
overwhelming them, and lashed his 
arms to that wheel which they had 
decked with garlands of briers, and 
made him carry it to Gallows 
Square. This I saw, dear souls, with 
my own eyes, and I saw Judge 
Bruecke come out on the balcony of 
the Town Hall and call down to the 
mob: ‘There must be no disorder, 
no disorder!’ A few others beside 
myself were able to hear him. 

“Abraham carried his burden to 
Gallows Square. There were at this 
time two malefactors in the pillory, 
one a thief, the other an unlicensed 
beggar. Therefore the mob lifted 
the wheel to the crossbar of the 
gallows, that Abraham might hang 
there; and they stoned him. The 
beggar called to him from the 
pillory: ‘Lord, remember me!’ But 
if Abraham replied the sound was 
broken by a stone. 

“1 spoke with a Christian in 
Gallows Square, who reminded me 
of a verse in the Gospel of Mat- 
thew: But all this was done, that 
the scriptures of the prophets might 
be fulfilled. Then all the disciples 
forsook him. and fled. I asked him, 
How often, how often must Christ 
be crucified? He was only grieved 
by my question and left me without 
responding. 

“In the first hour of evening, 
Abraham cried out: “Where is the 
New Jerusalem?’ I heard one voice 
answer him out of the dark of the 
crowd: ‘Not here, O my dear Lord, 
not here!' 

“At some time during that hour 
Abraham died."

A little belatedly I want to tell 
you about Philip K. Dick's new 
novel Flow My Tears The Police- 
man Said (Doubleday, $5.95). It 
is not for nothing that the new rash 
of academic studies of sf, which 
may nod in passing to a parade of 
our greats, give whole pages, whole 
chapters, to Philip K. Dick. Writ- 
ing a concise description of one of 
his books, sketching one of his 
plots, is like trying to carve a leaf- 
less tree in granite. Real and solid 
(and strange, and far out) as his 
characters may be, they all exhibit 
complex traceries of personality 
quite impossible to predict and 
sometimes just the other side of the 
reader’s ability to understand. The 


effect, of course, is the creation of 
a work that your head won’t put 
down even if your hands do. The 
policeman here is that rarity, a 
totally detestable character with 
whom you must empathize, and 
with whom, ultimately, you will 
sympathize as well. But he isn’t the 
protagonist. It isn’t his story, 
though the story could not exist 
without him. The narrative belongs 
to Jason Taverner, TV superstar, 
who awakes in a world in which he 
has never existed. This is not the 
first time this unsettling concept 
has been used but I will guarantee 
that you won’t anticipate the ra- 
tionale for this one until Dick is 
good and ready to give it to you.

S culptor Sterling E. Lanier’s 
Chilton Hardcover is now in 
paperback. Hiero's Journey (Ban- 
tam, 372 pp, with map and glos- 
sary, $1.25) is a lot of adventure for 
the money. Set in a post-atomic 
world in which mutated animals 
abound, many of them with ex- 
tremely high intelligence, it deals 
with a warrior- priest and his quest 
fora nigh-legendary device called a 
“computer”. He is accompanied, 
as the story goes on, by a telepathic 
bear (who is, to my taste, the most 
interesting character in the book), 
a gigantic moose-like mount, and a 
lost black princess. “Journey” is 
recognized as a technical term for a 
certain kind of narrative, wherein 
the characters move through a 
strange land (completely under the 
control of the author) and have 
unexpected encounters. Heiro is a 
likable hero and my only cavila are 
that, as in so many swords-and- 
sorcery tales, you just know he is 
going to win, I like a little doubt to 
spice my suspense, and that his evil 
opponents are too totally, unre- 


lievedly evil. For all that, it’s ex- 
hilarating escape reading. 

Now, here’s a real find. It is, as 
far as I know, a first novel and if 
that’s really so, we have a new 
writer whose launch-pad is built on 
a very high place indeed. An 
Apology for Rain (Doubleday, 
$4.95) by Jean Mark Gawron, 
exemplifies a new thrust in sf that is 
popping up in new works from all 
over: the orientation of self in so- 
ciety, and the close and critical 
examination of reality itself. Phil 
Dick’s novel is certainly an 
example, and so is Ms. Gawron’s. 
(Lanier’s is not, you see: Hiero is as 
oriented to his strange world as he 
can be, and the reality of it is as 
solidly real as the author can make 
it.) Ms. Gawron’s book deals with a 
post-blast situation too, though in 
a rather more immediate future. 
Her protagonist is also a super- 
person with unusual extra talents 
but she (a leather-clad girl called 
Bonnie) knows only partially their 
nature and extent, and what she is 
expected to do with them. Her 
quest, then, is for something in- 
terior and totally surprising. Her 
relationship with her brother, who 
ghosts about on the perimeter of 
her adventure, and with the people 
she meets and deals with, add to 
her knowledge of her changing 
situation and always to her knowl- 
edge of herself. Gawron commands 
my vast approval on two counts: a 
prose style as bright and smooth as 
stainless steel, and an approach to

her work as analog, as fable, as an 
instructive parallel to a great deal 
of what we, as a tottering culture, 
must confront or die. One other 
thing is worth noting and I have 
had occasion to mention this else- 
where. There is in this book a de- 
gree of extreme but perfectly con- 
trolled violence that I have seen be- 
fore only in the works of Josephine 
Saxton, Ursula K. LeGuin, Joanna 
Russ, Marion Zimmer Bradley, 
and Doris Piserchia. I do not know 
what this means. I know only that 
no male writer of my acquaintance 
does exactly this thing quite this 
well. I say this while still maintain- 
ing firmly that gender has nothing 
to do with quality. A good writer is 
a good writer whatever. Anyway, do 
yourself a favor and meet this extra- 
ordinary new writer. 

W ith our noses in our specialty 
(limitless though it may be) 
we run the risk of missing some 
very good writing from other areas, 
and it is only when one of them 
drifts into our vortex from the 
mainstream that we become aware 
of it. Such is the case with Marc 
Brandel and his The Man Who 
Liked Women (Pocket Books, 307 
pp., $1.50), the reprint of a 1972 
Simon and Schuster novel, a per- 
fectly and thoroughly delightful 
fantasy about a young American 
businessman in London from whose 
brow is born no other than Venus 
herself. The book seems to have

fluent storyteller from an engaging 
notion which promised a sort of 
Thorne Smith romp; then in its un- 
folding, the narrative and especially 
its heroine suffused the author with 
love. He then appears to take him- 
self (and her) a good deal more 
seriously than*, perhaps, he had 
intended. The result is a searching, 
memorable, deeply touching tale 
with an ending that can only be de- 
scribed as a sweet ache. There may 
be greater books around but it’s 
hard for me to name one that I 
liked more. Do read it. 

T here’s one book that troubles 
me profoundly only because it’s 
so damned good, and what’s wrong 
with it seems to me to have been 
well within the author’s enormous 
skill to have repaired. Recently 
serialized here, it's Inverted World, 
by Christopher Priest, (Harper and 
Row, 240 pp., $6.95) Not since 
Larry Nevins’ Ringworld has there 
been an sf concept as original as 
Priest’s hyperboloid planet. The 
strange and puzzling city on tracks, 
which exists only to move and to 
move again through endless miles 
of inhospitable country, while weird 
distortions of space and time pre- 
cede and follow it, makes for one of 
the most interesting ideas and de- 
velopments I have seen anywhere. I 
like, too, the author’s skillful 
switching from subjective to objec- 
tive points of view — first to third 
person — which in less careful hands 
could have been a disaster. Why 


then could he not have switched 
just once more, and, here and 
there, have given us a native’s view 
of the coming, and passing, and 
leaving of the city, and from their 
vantage point, of the distortion 
phenomena associated with it? 
When the protagonist Helward es- 
corted the women "down past,” 
why couldn’t he let us see what 
happened to them from the point of 
view of a resident observer, and 
what this same observer might have 
seen as Helward hung, as it were, 
over the edge of the world? To 
make sense of these comments, it is 
of course necessary for you to read 
the book and 1 sincerely hope that 
you do, for in discovering its flaws, 
you will encounter its virtues, which 
are many indeed. 

I really envy anyone who for the 
first time encounters the work 
of Stanley G. Weinbaum. Though 
speckled with depression-era 
idioms, his reaching imagination, 
his inventiveness, his humor and 
his pathos injected something 
brand-new and vital into the sf of 
1934, as Isaac Asimov in an intro- 
duction, and Robert Bloch, in a 
most moving Afterword, vividly ex- 
press. To learn that the writing life 
of this years-ahead-of-his-time 
author — from the publication of A 
Martian Odyssey in 1934 until his 
death from cancer — lasted just 17 
months, is to know the real taste of 
regret and a great surge of “if 
only.” By all means get The Best of

A very special note: Anyone who 
. is remotely interested in the 
many aspects of sf must — I said 
must — be, or get, familiar with 
Locus. If you think it’s just another 
fanzine, think again. It’s a bi- 
monthly newsletter out of San 
Francisco which covers everything 
conceivable of interest to the field — 
book reviews, awards, functions 
such as conventions and club meet- 
ings, addresses of authors and 
other personalities, and above all, 
news: news of forthcoming books 
and the contents of forthcoming 
magazine issues, of anthologists 
looking for authors, of film deals 
and production schedules. Time 
and again I have known Locus to 
scoop the Hollywood trade press in 
the area of sf films and TV. My 
reason for delivering this special 
plug is the recent shift Locus has 
undergone from mimeo to offset — a 
huge improvement but one which 
threatens to kill the paper if it 
doesn't get more support. It’s 
largely a labor of love, and I don’t 
think the young publishers, Charlie 
and Dona Brown, have ever wanted 
much more for it than that it 
breaks even. You could hardly 
spend $6.00 more worthily than to 
send for a subscription. So skip a 
movie or cook one more dinner at 
one, and subscribe. Nobody loses.

Francisco, CA 94119. 


and speaking of special things, 
J"\. here’s what I call a “pe- 
ripheral.” The industrious William 
R. Corliss (the same Corliss, by the 
way, who wrote the book on build- 
ing a new world through nuclear 
technology, co-authoring with 
Glenn Seaborg, Man and Atom, 
from Dutton a few years ago) who 
wrote the handsome and fascinating 
Strange Phenomena about which I 
told you a couple of issues ago, has 
produced another: Strange Arti- 
facts. and this has got to be the 
weirdest sentence I ever structured, 
(Indeed. Ed.) Strange Artifacts, 
like its predecessor, is a good-look- 
ing 7”x9” loose-leaf of some 270- 
plus pages, ingeniously indexed 
and ready for the smooth inclusion 
of future data. It’s the kind of book 
you don’t dare pick up if you have 
to be somewhere soon. That it goes 
heavily into Easter Island and 
Stonehenge is to be expected, but it 
goes into many other things, from 
documents old and new, which I 
find much more astonishing than 
either of those. I understand that a 
second volume of Strange Phe- 
nomena will be off the press this 
summer. I’ll let you know. They’re 
privately distributed and $6.95 
each: write William R. Corliss at P. 
O. Box 107, Glen Arm, MD 21057.

space again, without getting 
into my unjustly-brief notices of 
lots and lots of books. Maybe next

THE GIFT OF 
GARIGOLLI 


FREDERIK POHL and C. M. KORNBLUTH 


G ARIGOLLI 

To Home Base 
Greeting, Chief, 

I’m glad you’re 
pleased with the demographics and 
cognitics studies. You don’t men- 
tion the orbital mapping, but I 
suppose that’s all complete and 
satisfactory. 

Now will you please tell 
me how we’re going to get off this 
lousy planet? 

Keep firmly in mind. 
Chief, that we’re not complainers. 
You don’t have a better crew any- 
where in the Galaxy and you know 
it. We've complied with the Triple 
Directive, every time, on every 
planet we’ve explored. Remember 
Arcturus XII? But this time we’re 
having trouble. After all, look at 
the disproportion in mass. And 
take a look at the reports we’ve sent 
in. These are pretty miserable sen- 
tients. Chief. 

So will you let us 
know, please, if there has ever been 


an authorized exception to Direc- 
tive Two? I don’t mean we aren’t 
going to bust a link to comply — if 
we can — but frankly, at this mo- 
ment, I don’t see how. 

And we need 
to get out of here fast. 

Garigolli. 


although it was a pretty morning 
in June, with the blossoms 
dropping off the catalpa trees and 
the algae blooming in the 12-foot 
plastic pool, I was not enjoying 
either my breakfast or the morning 
mail. 

The letter from the lawyer start- 
ed, the way letters from lawyers do, 
with 

RE: GUDSELL VS. DUPOIR 

and went on to advise Dupoir 
(that’s me, plus my wife and our 
two-year-old son Butchie) that 
unless a certified check arrived in 
Undersigned’s office before close of 


97 



business June 11th (that was to- 
morrow) in the amount of 
$14,752.03, Undersigned would be 
compelled to institute Proceedings 
at once. 

I showed it to my wife, Shirl, for 
lack of anything better to do. 

She read it and nodded intelli- 
gently. “He’s really been very pa- 
tient with us, considering,” she 
said. “I suppose this is just some 
more lawyer-talk?” 

It had occurred to me, for a wild 
moment, that maybe she had 
$14,752.03 in the old sugar bowl as 
a surprise for me, but I could see 
she didn’t. I shook my head. “This 
means they take the house,” I said. 
“I’m not mad any more. But you 
won’t sign anything for your brother 
after this, will you?” 

“Certainly not,” she said, shock- 
ed. “Shall I put that letter in the 
paper-recycling bin?” 

“Not just yet,” I said, taking off 
my glasses and hearing aid. Shirl 
knows perfectly well that I can’t 
hear her when my glasses are off, 
but she kept on talking anyway as 
she wiped the apricot puree off 
Butchie’s chin, rescued the milk 
glass, rinsed the plastic infant-food 
jar and dropped it in the “plastics” 
carton, rinsed the lid and put it in 
the “metals” box and poured my 
coffee. We are a very ecological 
household. It astonishes me how 
good Shirl is at things like that, 
considering. 

I waved fruit flies away from the 
general direction of my orange juice 


and put my glasses back on in time 
to catch her asking, wonderingly, 
‘‘What would they do with our 
house? I mean, I'm not a demon 
decorator like Ginevra Freedman. I 
just like it comfortable and neat.” 

‘‘They don’t exactly want the 
house,” I explained. “They just 
want the money they’ll get after 
they sell it to somebody else.” Her 
expression cleared at once. Shirl al- 
ways likes to understand things. 

I sipped my coffee, fending off 
Butchie’s attempt to grab the cup, 
and folded the letter and laid it 
across my knees like an unsheathed 
scimitar, ready to taste the blood of 
the giaour, which it kind of was. 
Butchie indicated that he would 
like to eat it, but I didn’t see that 
that would solve the problem. Al- 
though I didn’t have any better way 
of solving it, at that. 

I finished the orange juice, 
patted Butchie’s head and, against 
my better judgment, gave Shirl the 
routine kiss on the nose. 

“Well,” she said, “I’m glad 
that’s settled. Isn’t it nice the way 
the mail comes first thing in the 
morning now?” 

I said it was very nice and left for 
the bus but, really, I could have 
been just as happy if Undersigned’s 
letter had come any old time. The 
fruit flies were pursuing me all the 
way down the street. They seemed 
to think they could get nourish- 
ment out of me, which suggested 
that fruit flies were about equal in 
intelligence to brothers-in-law. It

was not a surprising thought. I had 
thought it before. 

AR1GOLLI 

To Home Base 

Chief, 

The mobility of this Host is a con- 
stant pain in the spermatophore. 
Now he’s gone off on the day-cycle 
early, and half the crew are still 
stuck in his domicile. Ultimate 
Matrix knows how they’ll handle it 
if we don’t get back before they run 
out of group empathy. 

You’ve got no 
reason to take that tone. Chief. 
We're doing a good job and you 
know it. “Directive One: To remain 
undetected by sentients on planet 
being explored.” A hundred and 
forty-four p.g., right? They don’t 
have a clue we’re here, although I 
concede that that part is fairly easy, 
since they are so much bigger than 
we are. “Directive Three: Subject 
to Directives One and Two, to 
make a complete study of geo- 
graphic, demographic, ecological 
and cognitic factors and to transmit 
same to Home Base.” You actually 
complimented us on those! It’s only 
Directive Two that’s giving us 
trouble. 

We're still trying, but did it 
ever occur to you that maybe these 
people don't deserve Directive Two? 

Garigolli 

I loped along the jungle trail to 
the bus stop, calculating with my 
razor-sharp mind that the distance 


from the house was almost exactly 
14,752.03 centimeters. As centi- 
meters it didn’t sound bad at all. 
As money, $14,752.03 was the kind 
of sum I hadn’t written down since 
Commercial Arithmetic in P.S. 98. 

I fell in with Barney Freedman, 
insurance underwriter and husband 
of Ginevra, the Demon Decorator. 
“Whatever became of Commercial 
Arithmetic?” I asked him. “Like 
ninety-day notes for fourteen thou- 
sand seven hundred and fifty-two 
dollars and three cents at six per 
cent simple interest? Although why 
anybody would be dumb enough to 
lend anybody money for ninety days 
beats me. If he doesn’t have it now, 
he won’t have it in ninety days.” 
“You’re in some kind of 
trouble.” 

“Shrewd guess.” 

“So what did Shirl do now?” 
“She co-signed a note for her 
brother,” I said. “When he went 
into the drying-out sanitarium for 
the gold treatment. They wouldn’t 
take him on his own credit, for 
some reason. They must have gold- 
plated him. He said the note was 
just a formality, so Shirl didn’t 
bother me with it.” 

We turned the corner. Barney 
said, “Ginevra didn’t bother me 
once when the telephone com- 
pany — ” 

“So when Shirl’s brother got un- 
drunk,” I said, “he told her not to 
worry about it and went to Cali- 
fornia. He thought he might catch 
on with the movies.” 



THE GIFT OF GARIGOLLI

“Did he?” 

“He didn’t even catch cold with 
the movies. Then they sent us the 
bill. Fourteen thou — well, they had 
it all itemized. Three nurses. Medi- 
cation. Suite. Occupational Ther- 
apy. Professional services. Hydro- 
therapy. Group counseling. One- 
to-one counseling. Limousine. 
Chauffeur for limousine. Chauf- 
feur’s helper for limousine. Chauf- 
feur’s helper’s hard-boiled eggs for 
lunch. Salt for chauffeur’s helper’s 
hard-boiled — ” 

“You’re getting hysterical,” Bar- 
ney said. “You mean he just 
skipped?” We were at the bus stop, 
with a gaggle of other prosperous 
young suburbanites. 

1 said, “Like a flat rock on a 
pond. So we wrote him, and of 
course the letters came back. They 
didn’t fool around, the ‘Institute 
for Psychosomatic Adjustment 
didn’t.” 

“That’s a pretty name.” 

“I telephoned a man up there to 
explain, when we got the first 
letter. He didn’t sound pretty. Just 
tired. He said my wife shouldn’t 
sign things without reading them. 
And he said if his house was — 
something about joint tenancy in 
fee simple, he would break his 
wife’s arm if she was the type that 
signed things without reading them, 
and keep on rebreaking it until she 
stopped. Meanwhile they had laid 
out a lot of goods and services in 
good faith, and what was I going to 
do about it?” 


The bus appeared on the hori- 
zon, emitting jet trails of Diesel 
smog. We knotted up by the sign. 
“So I told him I didn’t know,” I 
said, “but I know now. I’ll get 
sued, that’s what I’ll do. The 
Dupoirs always have an answer to 
every problem.” 

Conversation was suspended for 
fifteen seconds of scrimmage while 
we entered the bus. Barney and I 
were lucky. We wound up with our 
heads jammed affectionately to- 
gether, not too far from a window 
that sucked in Diesel fumes and 
fanned them at us. I could see the 
fruit flies gamely trying to get back 
to my ear, but they were losing the 
battle. 

Barney said, "Hey. Couldn’t you 
sell your house to somebody you 
trusted for a dollar, and then they 
couldn’t — ” 

“Yes, they could. And then we'd 
both go to jail. I asked a guy in our 
legal department.” 

“Huh.” The bus roared on, past 
knots of other prosperous young 
suburbanites who waved their fists 
at us as we passed. “How about 
this. I hope you won’t take this the 
wrong way. But couldn’t there be 
some angle about Shirl being, uh, 
not exactly competent to sign any 
kind of — 

“I asked about that too, Barney. 
No hope. Shirl’s never been hos- 
pitalized, she’s never been to a 
shrink, she runs a house and a hus- 
band and a small boy just fine. 
Maybe she’s a little impulsive. But

a lot of people are impulsive, the 
man said,” 


ARIGOLLI 

To Home Base 

Chief, 

I think we’ve got it. These people 
use a medium of exchange, remem- 
ber? And the Host doesn’t have 
enough of it! What could be 
simpler? 

With a little modification there 
are a couple of local organisms that 
should be able to concentrate the 
stuff out of the ambient environ- 
ment, and then — 

And then we’re off the impaling 
spike!

railroad station and we boiled

I arrived at the office punctually 
at 9:07, late enough to show that I

that Mr. Horgan would notice it. 
The frowning brow of my cave 
opened under the grim rock front 
that bore the legend “International

nodding good morning to several 
persons from the Fourteenth Floor, 
but being nodded to myself only by

Further 

to my last communication. Chief, 

We 

ran into a kind of a setback. We 
found a suitable organic substrate 
and implanted a colony of modified 
organisms which extracted gold 
from environmental sources, and 
they were performing beautifully, 
depositing a film of pure metal on 
the substrate, which the Host was 
carrying with him. 

Then he folded it 
up and threw it in a waste recep- 
tacle. 

We're still working on it, but 
I don’t know. Chief, I don’t know.

Falls, Idaho. And by scripting talk 
features about plastics which get 
run from 11:55 PM to 12:00 mid- 
night on radio stations the rest of 
whose programs time is devoted to 
public-service items like late jockey 
changes at Wheeling Downs. And 
by scripting television features 
which do not seem ever to be run on 
any station. And by handling the 
annual Miss Plastics contest, at 
least up to the point where actual 
contestants appear, when it is 
taken over by the people from the 
Fourteenth Floor. And by writing 
the monthly page of Plastics Briefs 
which goes out, already matted, to 
2,000 papers in North America. 
Plastics Briefs is our best bet be- 
cause each Brief is illustrated by a 
line drawing of a girl doing some- 
thing with, to or about plastics, and 
her costume is always brief. As I 
said, all this is not easy to explain, 
so when people ask me what I do I 
usually say, “Whatever Mr. Hor- 
gan tells me to.” 

This morning Mr. Horgan called 
me away from a conference with 
Jack Denny, our Briefs artist, and 
said: “Dupoir, that Century of 
Plastics Anniversary Dinner idea of 
yours is out. The Fourteenth Floor 
says it lacks thematic juice. Think 
of something else for a winter pro- 
motion, and think big!” He banged 
a plastic block on his desk with a 
little plastic hammer. 

I said, “Mr. Horgan, how about

books we should? Are we getting 
the message of polythene to every 
boy, girl, brother in law — ” 

He shook his head. “That’s 
small,” he said, and went on to ex- 
plain: “By which I mean it isn’t 
big. Also there is the flak we are 
getting from the nature nuts, which 
the Fourteenth Floor does not think 
you are dealing with in a creative 
way.” 

“I’ve ordered five thousand pop- 
up recycling bins for the test, Mr. 
Horgan. They’re not only plastic, 
they’re recycled plastic. We use 
them in my own home, and 1 am 
confident — ” 

“Confidence,” he said, “is when 
you’ve got your eyes so firmly fixed 
on the goal that you trip on a 
dog-doodie and fall in the crap.” 

I regrouped. “I think we can 
convert the present opposition from 
the ecology movement to — ” 

“The ecology movement,’’ he 
said, “is people who love buzzards 
better than babies and catfish 
better than cars.” 

I fell back on my last line of de- 
fense. “Yes, Mr. Horgan,” I said. 

"Personally,” Mr. Horgan said, 
“I like seeing plastic bottles bob- 
bing in the surf. It makes me feel, I 
don’t know, like part of something 
that is going to last forever. I want 
you to communicate that feeling, 
Dupoir. Now go get your Briefs 
out.” 

I thought of asking for a salary 
advance of $14,752.03, but hesi- 
tated. 


“Is there something else?” 
“No, Mr. Horgan. Thank you.” 
I left quietly. 

Jack Denny was still waiting in 
my office, doodling still-life studies 
of cornucopias with fruits and nuts 
spilling out of them. “Look,” he 
said, “how about this for a change? 
Something symbolic of the season, 
like ‘the rich harvest of Plastics to 
make life more gracious,’ like?” 

I said kindly, “You don’t under- 
stand copy. Jack. Do you remember 
what we did for last September?” 
He scowled. “A girl in halter and 
shorts, very brief and tight, putting 
up plastic storm windows.” 

“That's right. Well, I’ve got an 
idea for something kind of novel 
this year. A little two-act drama. 
Act One: She’s wearing halter and 
shorts and she’s taking down the 
plastic screens. Act Two: She’s 
wearing a dress and putting up the 
plastic storm windows. And this is 
important. In Act Two there’s 
wind, and autumn leaves blowing, 
and the dress is kind of wind-blown 
tight against her. Do you know 
what I mean, Jack?” 

He said evenly, “I was the young- 
est child and only boy in a family of 
eight. If I didn’t know what you 
meant by now I would deserve to be 
put away. Sometimes I think I 
will be put away. Do you know 
what seven older sisters can do to 
the psychology of a sensitive young 
boy?” He began to shake. 

“Draw, Jack,” I told him hastily. 
To give him a chance to recover

himself I picked up his cornu- 
copias. “Very nice,” I said, turning 
them over. “Beautiful modeling. 1 
guess you spilled some paint on this 
one?” 

He snatched it out of my hand. 
“Where? That? That’s gilt. I don’t 
even have any gilt.” 

“No offense. Jack. 1 just thought 
it looked kind of nice.” It didn’t, 
particularly, it was just a shiny 
yellow smear in a corner of the 
drawing. 

“Nice! Sure, if you’d let me use 
metallic inks. If you’d go to high- 
gloss paper. If you’d spend a few 
bucks — ” 

“Maybe, Jack,” I said, “it’d be 
better, at that, if you took these 
back to your office. You can con- 
centrate better there, maybe.” 

He went out, shaking. 

I stayed in and thought about my 
house and brother in law and the 
Gudsell Medical Credit Bureau and 
after a while I began to shake too. 
Shaking, I phoned a Mr. Klaw, 
whom I had come to think of as my 
“account executive” at Gudsell. 

Mr. Klaw was glad to hear from 
me. “You got our lawyer’s note? 
Good, good. And exactly what ar- 
rangements are you suggesting, 
Mr. Dupoir?” 

“I don't know,” I said openly. 
“It catches me at a bad time. If we 
could have an extension — ” 

“Extensions we haven’t got,” he 
said regretfully. “We had one 
month of extensions, and we gave 
you the month, and now we’re fresh 


out. I’m really sorry, Dupoir.” 
“With some time I could get a 
second mortgage, Mr. Klaw.” 
“You could at that, but not for 
$ 14 , 752 . 03 .” 

“Do you want to put me and my 
family on the street?” 

“Goodness, no, Mr. Dupoir! 
What we want is the sanitarium’s 
money, including our commission. 
And maybe we want a little bit to 
make people think before they sign 
things, and maybe that people who 
should go to the county hospital go 
to the county hospital instead of a 
frankly de luxe rest home.” 

“I’ll call you later,” I said. 
“Please do,” said Mr. Klaw sin- 
cerely. 

Tendons slack as the limp lianas, 
I leafed listlessly through the 
dhowani-bark jujus on my desk, 
studying Jack Denny’s draftsman- 
ship with cornucopias. The yellow 
stain, I noted, seemed to be spread- 
ing, even as a brother in law’s blood 
might spread on the sands of the 
doom-pit when the cobras hissed 
the hour of judgment. 

Mr. Horgan rapped perfunctorily 
on the doorframe and came in. “I 
had the impression, Dupoir, that 
you had something further to ask 
me at our conference this morning. 
I’ve learned to back those judg- 
ments. Dupoir.” 

“Well, sir — ” I began.

Well. Naturally, we couldn’t have 
that sort of financial irresponsi-

“Me, Mr. Horgan? Wanted? No. 
Nothing at all.” 

“Glad we cleared that up,” he 
grunted. “Can’t do your best work

with personal problems. Remem- 
ber, Dupoir. We want the country 
plastics conscious, and forget about 
those ecology freaks.” 

“Yes, Mr. Horgan.” 

“And big. Not small.” 

“Big it is, Mr. Horgan,” I said. I 
rolled up Jack Denny’s sketches 
into a thick wad and threw them at 
him in the door, but not before he 
had closed it behind him.

Listen Chief, 

I appreciate your try- 
ing to work out a solution for us, 
but you're not doing as well as 
we’re doing, even. Not that that’s 
much. 

We tried again to meet that 
constant aura of medium-of-ex- 
change need from the Host, but he 
destroyed the whole lash-up again. 
Maybe we’re misunderstanding 
him? 


Artifacts are out. He’s too big 
to see anything we make. Energy 
sources don’t look promising. Oh, 
sure, we could elaborate lesser 
breeds that would selectively con- 
centrate, for instance, plutonium 
or one of the uraniums. 1 don’t 
think this particular Host would 
know the difference unless the scale 
was very large, and then, blooie, 
critical mass. 

Meanwhile morale is 
becoming troublesome. We’re hold- 
ing together, but I wouldn’t de- 
scribe the condition as good. Velli- 
tot has been wooing Dinnoliss in 
spite of the secondary directives 
against breeding while on explora- 
tion missions. I’ve cautioned them 
both, but they don’t seem to stop. 
The funny thing is they’re both in 
the male phase. 

Garigolli. 


B etween Jack Denny and myself 
we got about half of the month's 
Plastics Briefs before quitting time. 
Maybe they weren’t big, but they 
were real wind-blown. All factors 
considered, I don’t think it is very 
much to my discredit that two 
hours later I was moodily drinking 
my seventh beer in a dark place 
near the railroad station. 

The bartender respected my 
mood, the TV was off, the juke box 
had nothing but blues on it and 
there was only one fly in my 
lugubrious ointment, a little man 
who kept trying to be friendly.

From time to time I gave him a 
scowl I had copied from Mr. Hor- 
gan. Then he would edge down the 
bar for a few minutes before edging 
back. Eventually he got up courage 
enough to talk, and I got too 
gloomy to crush him with my 
mighty thews, corded like the 
jungle-vines that looped from the 
towering nganga-pa\ms. 

He was some kind of hotel- 
keeper, it appeared. “My young 
friend, you may think you have 
problems, but there’s no business 
like my business. Mortgage, in- 
surance, state supervision, building 
and grounds maintenance, kitchen 
personnel and purchasing, linen, 
uniforms, the station wagon and 
the driver, carpet repairs — oh, 
God, carpet repairs! No matter how 
many ash trays you put around, you 
know what they do? They steal the 
ashtrays. Then they stamp out ciga- 
rettes on the carpets.” He began to 
weep. 

I told the bartender to give him 
another. How could I lose? If he 
passed out I’d be rid of him. If he 
recovered I would have his undy- 
ing, doglike affection for several 
minutes, and what kind of shape 
was I in to sneer at that? 

Besides, I had worked out some 
pretty interesting figures. “Did you 
know," I told him, “that if you 
spend $1.46 a day on cigarettes, 
you can save $14,752.03 by giving 
up smoking for 10,104 and a quar- 
ter days?” 

He wasn’t listening, but he 


wasn’t weeping any more either. He 
was just looking lovingly at his 
vodka libre, or whatever it was. I 
tried a different tack. “When you 
see discarded plastic bottles bobb- 
ing in the surf,” I asked, “does it 
make you feel like part of some- 
thing grand and timeless that will 
go on forever?” 

He glanced at me with distaste, 
then went back to adoring his 
drink. “Or do you like buzzards 
better than babies?” I asked. 

“They’re all babies,” he said. 
“Nasty, smelly, upchucking 
babies.” 

“Who are?” I asked, having lost 
the thread. He shook his head mys- 
teriously, patted his drink and 
tossed it down. 

“Root of most evil,” he said, 
swallowing. Then, affectionately, 
“Don’t know where I’d be with it, 
don’t know where I’d be without 
it.” 

He appeared to be talking about 
booze. “On your way home, with- 
out it?” I suggested. 

He said obscurely, “Digging 
ditches, without it.” Then he 
giggled. “Greatest business in the 
world! But oh! the worries! The 
competition! And when you come 
down to it it’s all just aversion, 
right?” 

“I can see you have a great 
aversion to liquor,” I said politely. 

“No, stupid! The guests. ’’ 

Stiffly I signaled for Number 
Eight, but the bartender misunder- 
stood and brought another for my 


THE GIFT OF GARIGOLLI 


107 



friend, too. I said, “You have an 
aversion to the guests?” 

He took firm hold on the bar and 
attempted to look squarely into my 
eyes, but wound up with his left eye 
four inches in front of my left eye 
and both our right eyes staring at 
respective ears. “The guests must 
be made to feel an aversion to 
alcohol, ” he said. “Secret of the 
whole thing. Works. Sometimes. 
But oh! it costs.” 

Like the striking fangs of Nag, 
the cobra, faster than the eye can 
follow, my trained reflexes swept 
the beer up to my lips. I drank 
furiously, scowling at him. “You 
mean to say you ran a drunk 
farm?” I shouted. 

He was shocked. “My boy! No 
need to be fulgar. An ‘institute’, 
eh? Let's leave the aversion to the 
drunks.” 

“I have to tell you, sir,” I de- 
clared, “that 1 have a personal rea- 
son for despising all proprietors of 
such institutions!” 

He began to weep again. “You, 
too! Oh, the general scorn.” 

“In my case, there is nothing 
general — ” 

“ — the hatred! The unthinking 
contempt. And for what?” 

I snarled, “For your blood-suck- 
ing ways.” 

“Blood, old boy?” he said, sur- 
prised. “No, nothing like that. We 
don’t use blood. We use gold, yes, 
but the gold cure’s old hat. Need 
new gimmick. Can’t use silver, too 
cheap. Really doesn’t matter what 


you say you use. All aversion — dry- 
ing them out, keeping them comfy 
and aversion. But no blood.” 

He wiggled his fingers for Num- 
ber Nine. Moodily I drank, glaring 
at him over my glass. 

“In the wrong end of it, I some- 
times think,” he went on medita- 
tively, staring with suspicious envy 
at the bartender. " He doesn’t have 
to worry. Pour it out, pick up the 
money. No concern about expen- 
sive rooms standing idle, staff loaf- 
ing around picking their noses, 
overhead going on, going on — you 
wouldn’t believe how it goes on, 
whether the guests are there to pay 
for it or not — ” 

“Hah,” I muttered. 

“You’ve simply no idea what I go 
through,” he sobbed. “And then 
they won’t pay. No, really. Fellow 
beat me out of $14,752.03 just 
lately. I’m taking it out of the co- 
signer's hide, of course, but after 
you pay the collection agency, 
what’s the profit?” 

I choked on the beer, but he was 
too deep in sorrow to notice. 

Strangling, I gasped, "Did you 
say fourteen thousand — ?” 

He nodded. “Seven hundred and 
fifty-two dollars, yes. And three 
cents. Astonishes you, doesn’t it, 
the deadbeats in this world?” 

I couldn’t speak. 

“You wouldn't think it,’’ he 
mourned. “All those salaries. All 
those rooms. The hydrotherapy 
tubs. The water bill.” 

I shook my head.

“Probably you think my life’s 
bowl of roses, hey?” 

1 managed to pry my larynx open 
enough to wheeze, “Up to this 
minute, yes, I did. You’ve opened 
my eyes." 

“Drink to that,” he said 
promptly. “Hey, barman!” 

But before the bartender got 
there with Number Ten the little 
man hiccoughed and slid melting to 
the floor, like a glacier calving into 
icebergs. 

The bartender peered over at 
him. “Every damn night,” he 
grumbled. “And who’s going to get 
him home this time?” 

My mind working as fast as Ngo, 
the dancing spider, spinning her 
web, I succeeded in saying, “Me. 
Glad to oblige. Never fear.”

Chief, 

All right, I admit we haven’t been 
exactly 144 p.g. on this project, but 
there’s no reason for you to get 
loose. Reciting the penalties for vio- 
lating the Triple Directive is un- 
called-for. 

Let me point out that 
there has been no question at any 
time of compliance with One or 
Three. And even Directive Two, 
well, we’ve done what we could. 
“To repay sentients in medium 
suitable to them for information 
gained.” These sentients are tricky. 
Chief. They don’t seem to empa- 


thize, really. See our reports. They 
often take without giving in return 
among themselves, and it seems to 
me that under the circumstances a 
certain modification of Directive 
Two would have been quite proper. 

But 

I am not protesting the ruling. 
Especially since you’ve pointed out 
it won’t do any good. When I get 
old and skinny enough to retire to a 
sling in Home Base I guess I’ll get 
that home-base mentality too, but 
way out here on the surface of the 
exploration volume it looks dif- 
ferent, believe me. 

And what is hap- 
pening with the rest of our crew 
back at Host’s domicile I can’t even 
guess. They must be nearly frantic 
by now. 

Garigolli. 


T here was some discussion with 
a policeman he wanted to hit 
(apparently under the impression 
that the cop was his night watch- 
man playing hookey), but I finally 
got the little man to the Institute 
for Psychosomatic Adjustment. 

The mausoleum that had gradu- 
ated my brother in law turned out 
to be three stories high, with a sun 
porch and a slate roof and bars on 
the ground-floor bay windows. It 
was not all that far from my house. 
Shirl had been pleased about that, 
I remembered. She said we could 
visit her brother a lot there, and in 
fact she had gone over once or twice 


THE GIFT OF GARIGOLLI

on Sundays, but me, I’d never set 
eyes on the place before. 

Dagger-sharp fangs flecking 
white spume, none dared dispute 
me as I strode through the great 
green corridors of the rain forest. 
Corded thews rippling like pythons 
under my skin, it was child’s play to 
carry the craven jackal to his lair. 
The cabbie helped me up the steps 
with him. 

The little man, now revealed as 
that creature who in anticipation 
had seemed so much larger and 
hairier, revived slightly as we enter- 
ed the reception hall. “Ooooh,” he 
groaned. “Watch the bouncing, old 
boy. That door. My office. Leather 
couch. Much obliged.” 

I dumped him on the couch, lit a 
green-shaded lamp on his desk, 
closed the door and considered. 

Mine enemy had delivered him- 
self into my power. All I had to do 
was seize him by the forelock. I 
seemed to see the faces of my 
family — Shirl’s smiling sweetly, 
Butchie’s cocoa-overlaid-with-oat- 
meal — spurring me on. 

There had to be a way. 

I pondered. Life had not equip- 
ped me for this occasion. Raffles or 
Professor Moriarity would have 
known what to do at once, but, 
ponder as I would, I couldn’t think 
of anything to do except to go 
through the drawers of his desk. 

Well, it was a start. But it yielded 
very little. Miscellaneous paper 
clips and sheaves of letterheads, a 
carton of cigarettes of a brand ap- 


parently flavored with rice wine and 
extract of vanilla, part of a fifth of 
Old Rathole and five switchblade 
knives, presumably taken from the 
inmates. There was also $6.15 in 
unused postage stamps, but I 
quickly computed that, even if I 
went to the trouble of cashing them 
in, that would leave me $14,745.88 
short. 

Of Papers to Burn there were 
none. 

All in all, the venture was a bust. 
I wiped out a water glass with one 
of the letterheads (difficult, be- 
cause they were of so high quality 
that they seemed likelier to shatter 
than to wad up), and forced down a 
couple of ounces of the whiskey 
(difficult, because it was of so low). 

Obviously anything of value, like 
for instance co-signed agreements 
with brothers in law, would be in a 
safe, which itself would probably be 
in the offices of the Gudsell Medi- 
cal Credit Bureau. Blackmail? But 
there seemed very little to work 
with, barring one or two curious 
photographs tucked in among the 
envelopes. Conceivably I could 
cause him some slight embarrass- 
ment, but nowhere near $14,752.03 
worth. I had not noticed any evi- 
dence of Red espionage that might 
put the little man (whose name, I 
learned from his letterhead, was 
Bermingham) away for 10,104 and 
a quarter days, while I saved up the 
price of reclaiming our liberty. 

There seemed to be only one pos- 
sible thing to do.

Eyes glowing like red coals be- 
hind slitted lids, I walked lightly on 
velvet-soft pads to the kraal of the 
witch-man. He was snoring with his 
mouth open. Totally vulnerable to 
his doom. 

Only, how to inflict it? 

It is not as easy as one might 
think to murder a person. Es- 
pecially if one doesn’t come pre- 
pared for it. Mr. Horgan doesn’t 
like us to carry guns at the office, 
and heaven knows what Shirl would 
do with one if I left it around home. 
Anyway, 1 didn’t have one. 

Poison was a possibility. The Old 
Rathole suggested itself. But we’d 
already tried that, hadn’t we? 

I considered the switchblade 
knives. There was a technical prob- 
lem, Would you know where the 
heart is? Granted, it had to be in- 
side his chest somewhere, and 
sooner or later I could find it. But 
what would I say to Mr. Berming- 
ham after the first three or four ex- 
ploratory stabs woke him up? 

The only reasonably efficient 
method I could think of to insure 
Mr. Bermingham’s decease was to 
burn the place down with him in it. 
Which, I quickly perceived, meant 
with whatever cargo of drying-out 
drunks the Institute now possessed 
in it too, behind those barred win- 
dows. 

At this point I came face to face 
with myself. 

I wasn’t going to kill anybody. I 
wasn’t going to steal any papers. 

What I was going to do was, I 


was going to let Mr. Klaw’s lawyers 
go ahead and take our house, be- 
cause I just didn’t know how to do 
anything else. I hefted the switch- 
blades in my hand, threw them 
against the wall and poured myself 
another slug of Mr. Bermingham’s 
lousy whiskey, wishing it would kill 
me right there and be a lesson to 
him.

Now, 

don’t get excited. Chief, 

Butwe have 

another problem. 

Before I get into 
it, 1 would like to remind you of a 
couple of things. First, I was 
against exploring this planet in the 
first place, remember? I said it 
was going to be very difficult, on 
the grounds of the difference in 
mass between its dominant species 
and us. I mean, really. Here we are, 
fighting member to member against 
dangerous beasts all the time, and 
the beasts, to the Host and his race, 
are only microorganisms that live 
unnoticed in their circulatory sys- 
tems, their tissues, their food and 
their environment. Anybody could 
tell that this was going to be a 
tough assignment, if not an im- 
possible one. 

Then there’s the fact 
that this Host moves around so. I 
told you some of our crew got left in 
his domicile. Well, we’ve timed this 


THE GIFT OF GARIGOLLI 


111 



before, and almost always he re- 
turns within 144 or 216 time-units — 
at most, half of one of his planet’s 
days. It’s pretty close to critical, 
but our crew is tough and they can 
survive empathy-deprival that long. 
Only this time he has been away, so 
far, nearly 432 time-units. It’s bad 
enough for those of us who have 
been with him. The ones who were 
cut off back at his domicile must 
have been through the tortures of 
the damned. 

Two of them homed in 
on us to report just a few time-units 
ago, and I’m afraid you’re not 
going to like what’s happened. 
They must have been pretty 
panicky. They decided to try meet- 
ing the Second Directive them- 
selves. They modified some micro- 
organisms to provide some organic 
chemicals they thought the Host 
might like. 

Unfortunately the or- 
ganisms turned out to have an ap- 
petite for some of the Host’s house- 
hold artifacts, and they’re pretty 
well demolished. So we not only 
haven’t given him anything to com- 
ply with Directive Two, we’ve taken 
something from him. And in the 
process maybe we’ve called atten- 
tion to ourselves. 

I’m giving it to you 
arced , Chief, because I know that’s 
how you’d like it. I accept full re- 
sponsibility. 

Because I don’t have 
any choice, do I? 

Garigolli. 


U\\7 HKT t * ie Hell,” said the 
▼ ▼voice of Mr. Bermingham, 
from somewhere up there, “are you 
doing in my office?” 

I opened my eyes, and he was 
quite right. I was in Mr. Berming- 
ham’s office. The sun was stream- 
ing through Mr. Bermingham’s 
Venetian blinds, and Mr. Berming- 
ham was standing over me with a 
selection of the switchblade knives 
in his hands. 

I don’t know how Everyman re- 
acts to this sort of situation. I guess 
I ran about average. I pushed my- 
self up on one elbow and blinked at 
him. 

“Spastic,” he muttered to him- 
self. "Well?” 

I cleared my throat. ‘‘I, uh, 
I think I can explain this.” 

He was hung over and shaking. 
“Go ahead! Who the devil are 
you?” 

“Well, my name is Dupoir.” 

“I don’t mean what’s your name, 
I mean — Wait a minute. Dupoir?” 
“Dupoir.” 

“As in $14,752.03?” 

“That’s right, Mr. Berming- 
ham.” 

“You!” he gasped. “Say, you’ve 
got some nerve coming here this 
way. I ought to teach you a lesson.” 
I scrambled to my feet. Mighty 
thews rippling, I tossed back my 
head and bellowed the death-chal- 
lenge of the giant anthropoids with 
whom I had been raised. 

Bermingham misunderstood. It 
probably didn't sound like a death-

challenge to him. He said anx- 
iously, “If you’re going to be sick, 
go in there and do it. Then we’re 
going to straighten this thing out.” 

I followed his pointing finger. 
There on one side of the foyer was 
the door marked Staff Washroom, 
and on the other the door to the 
street through which I had carried 
him. It was only the work of a 
second to decide which to take. I 
was out the door, down the steps, 
around the corner and hailing a 
fortuitous cab before he could 
react. 

By the time I got to the house 
that Mr. Klaw wanted so badly to 
take away from us it was 7:40 on 
my watch. There was no chance at 
all that Shirl would still be asleep. 
There was not any very big chance 
that she had got to sleep at all that 
night, not with her faithful hus- 
band for the first time in the four 
years of our marriage staying out 
all night without warning, but no 
chance at all that she would be still 
in bed. So there would be explain- 
ing to do. Nevertheless I insinuated 
my key into the lock of the back 
door, eased it open, slipped ghost- 
like through and gently closed it 
behind me. 

I smelled like a distillery, I 
noticed, but my keen, jungle-train- 
ed senses brought me no other mes- 
sage. No one was in sight or sound. 
Not even Butchie was either chat- 
tering or weeping to disturb the 
silence. 

I slid silently through the mud- 


room into the half-bath where I 
kept a spare razor. I spent five 
minutes trying to convert myself 
into the image of a prosperous 
young executive getting ready to be 
half an hour late at work, but it was 
no easy job. There was nothing but 
soap to shave with, and Butchie 
had knocked it into the sink. What 
was left was a blob of jelly, sculpted 
into a crescent where the dripping 
tap had eroded it away. Still, I got 
clean, more or less, and shaved, 
less. 

I entered the kitchen, and then 
realized that my jungle-trained 
senses had failed to note the pres- 
ence of a pot of fresh coffee perking 
on the stove. I could hear it plainly 
enough. Smelling it was more diffi- 
cult; its scent was drowned by the 
aroma of cheap booze that hung in 
the air all around me. 

So I turned around and yes, there 
was Shirl on the stairway, holding 
Butchie by one hand like Maureen 
O’Sullivan walking Cheeta. She 
wore an expression of unrelieved 
tragedy. 

It was clearly necessary to give 
her an explanation at once, whether 
I had one or not. “Honey,” I said, 
“I’m sorry. I met this fellow I 
hadn’t seen in a long time, and we 
got to talking. I know we should 
have called. But by the time I 
realized the time it was so late I was 
afraid I’d wake you up.” 

“You can’t wear that shirt to the 
office,” she said woefully. “I ironed 
your blue and gray one with the

white cuffs. It’s in the closet.” 

I paused to analyze the situation. 
It appeared she wasn’t angry at all, 
only upset — which, as any husband 
of our years knows, is 14,752.03 
times worse. In spite of the fact that 
the reek of bdoze was making me 
giddy and fruit flies were buzzing 
around Shirl’s normally immacu- 
late kitchen, I knew what I had to 
do. “Shirl,” I said, falling to one 
knee, “I apologize.” 

That seemed to divert her. 
“Apologize? For what?” 

“For staying out all night.” 

“But you explained all that. You 
met this fellow you hadn’t seen in a 
long time, and you got to talking. 
By the time you realized the time it 
was so late you were afraid you’d 
wake me up.” 

“Oh, Shirl,” I cried, leaping to 
my feet and crushing her in my 
mighty thews. I would have kissed 
her. but the reek of stale liquor 
seemed even stronger. I was afraid 
of what close contact might do, not 
to mention its effect on Butchie, 
staring up at me with a thumb and 
two Fingers in his mouth. We 
Dupoirs never do anything by 
halves. 

But there was a tear in her eye. 
She said, “I watched Butchie, 
honestly I did. I always do. When 
he broke the studio lamp I was 
watching every minute, remember? 
He was just too fast for me.” 

I didn’t have any idea what she 
was talking about. That is not an 
unfamiliar situation in our house. 


and I have developed a technique 
for dealing with it. “What?” I 
asked. 

“He was too fast for me,” Shirl 
said woefully. "When he dumped 
his vitamins into his raisins and 
oatmeal I was right there. I went to 
get some paper napkins, and that 
was when he did it. But how could I 
know it would ruin the plastics 
bin?” 

I went into Phase Two. “What 
plastics bin?” 

“Our plastics bin.” She pointed. 
“Where Butchie threw the stuff.” 

At once I saw what she meant. 
There was a row of four plastic 
popup recycling bins in our kit- 
chen, one for paper, one for plas- 
tics, one for glass and one for 
metals. They were a credit to us, 
and to Mr. Horgan and to the Four- 
teenth Floor. However, the one 
marked “plastics” was not a credit 
to anyone any more. It had sprung 
a leak. A colorless fluid was oozing 
out of the bottom of it and, what- 
ever it was, it was deeply pitting the 
floor tiles. 

I bent closer and realized where 
the reek of stale booze was coming 
from: out of the juices that were 
seeping from our plastics bin. 

“What the devil?” I asked. 

Shirl said thoughtfully, “If vita- 
mins can do that to plastic, what do 
you suppose they do to Butchie’s in- 
sides?” 

“It isn’t the vitamins. I know 
that much.” I reached in and hook- 
ed the handle of what had been a 


114 


GALAXY 



milk jug, gallon size. It was high- 
density polythene and about four 
hundred per cent more indestruc- 
tible than Mount Rushmore. It was 
exactly the kind of plastic jug that 
people who loved buzzards better 
than babies have been complaining 
about finding bobbing around the 
surf of their favorite bathing 
beaches, all the world over. 

Indestructible or not, it was 
about ninty per cent destroyed. 
What I pulled out was a handle and 
part of a neck. The rest drizzled off 
into a substance very like the stuff I 
had shaved with. Only that was 
soap, which one expects to dissolve 
from time to time. High-density 
polythene one does not. 

The fruit flies were buzzing 
around me, and everything was 
very confusing. I was hardly aware 
that the front doorbell had rung 
until I noticed that Shirl had gone 
to answer it. 

What made me fully aware of 
this was Mr. Bermingham’s trium- 
phant roar: “Thought I’d find you 
here. Dupoir! And who are these 
people — your confederates?” 

Bermingham had no terrors for 
me. I was past that point. I said, 
“Hello, Mr. Bermingham. This 
confederate is my wife, the littler 
one here is my son. Shirl, Butchie — 
Mr. Bermingham. Mr. Berming- 
ham’s the one who is going to take 
away our house.” 

Shirl said politely, “You must be 
tired, Mr. Bermingham. I’ll get you 
a cup of coffee.”

Chief, 

I 

admit it, we’ve excreted this one 
out beyond redemption. Don’t 
bother to reply to this. Just write us 
off. 

I could say that it wasn’t en- 
tirely the fault of the crew members 
who stayed behind in the Host’s 
domicile. They thought they had 
figured out a way to meet Directive 
Two. They modified some organ- 
isms — didn’t even use bacteria, just 
an enzyme that hydrated polythene 
into what they had every reason to 
believe was a standard food sub- 
stance, since the Host had been ob- 
served to ingest it with some fre- 
quency. There is no wrong-doing 
there, Chief. Alcohols are standard 
foods for many organic beings, as 
you know. And a gift of food has 
been held to satisfy the second 
Directive. And add to that they 
they were half out of their plexuses 
with empathy deprivation. 

Neverthe- 
less I admit the gift failed in a fairly 
basic way, since it seems to have 
damaged artifacts the Hosts hold 
valuable. 

So I accept the responsi- 
bility, Chief, Wipe this expedition 
off the records. We’ve failed, and 
we’ll never see our home breeding- 
slings again. 

Please notify our des- 
cendants and former co-parents 
and, if you can, try to let them

think we died heroically, won’t 
you? 

Garigolli. 


S hirl has defeated the wrath of 
far more, complex creatures 
than Mr. Bermingham by offering 
them coffee — me, for instance. 
While she got him the clean cup 
and the spoon and the milk out of 
the pitcher in the refrigerator, I 
had time to think. 

Mr. Horgan would be interested 
in what had happened to our plas- 
tics eco-bin. Not only Mr. Horgan. 
The Fourteenth Floor would be in- 
terested. The ecology freaks them- 
selves would be interested, and 
maybe would forget about liking 
buzzards better than babies long 
enough to say a good word for In- 
ternational Plastics Co. 

I mean, this was significant. It 
was big, by which I mean it wasn’t 
little. It was a sort of whole new 
horizon for plastics. The thing 
about plastics, as everyone knows, 
is that once you convert them into 
trash they stay trash. Bury a maple 
syrup jug in your back yard and five 
thousand years from now some 
descendant operating a radar-con- 
trolled peony-planter from his back 
porch will grub it up as shiny as 
new. But the gunk in our eco-bin 
was making these plastics, or at 
least the polythene parts of them, 
bio-degradable. 

What was the gunk? I had no 
idea. Some random chemical com- 


bination between Butchie’s oatmeal 
and his vitamins? I didn’t care. It 
was there, and it worked. If we 
could isolate the stuff, I had no 
doubt that the world-famous scien- 
tists who gave us the plastic storm 
window and the popup eco-bin 
could duplicate it. And if we could 
duplicate it we could sell it to 
hard-pressed garbagemen all over 
the world. The Fourteenth Floor 
would be very pleased. 

With me to think was ever to act. 

I rinsed out one of Butchie’s baby- 
food jars in the sink, scraped some 
of the stickiest parts of the melting 
plastic into it and capped it tightly. 
I couldn’t wait to get it to the office. 

Mr. Bermingham was staring at 
me with his mouth open. “Good 
Lord,” he muttered, “playing with 
filth at his age. What psychic dam- 
age we wreak with bad early toilet- 
training.” 

I had lost interest in Mr. Berm- 
ingham. I stood up and told him, 
“I’ve got to go to work. I’d be 
happy to walk you as far as the 
bus.” 

“You aren’t going anywhere, 
Dupoir! Came here to talk to you. 
Going to do it, too. Behavior was 
absolutely inexcusable, and I de- 
mand — Say, Dupoir, you don’t 
have a drink anywhere about the 
house, do you?” 

“More coffee, Mr. Berming- 
ham?” Shirl said politely. “I’m 
afraid we don’t have anything 
stronger to offer you. We don’t 
keep alcoholic beverages here, or at 


116

least not very long. Mr. Dupoir 
drinks them.” 

“Thought so,” snarled Berming- 
ham. “Recognize a drunk when I 
see one: shifty eyes, irrational be- 
havior, duplicity — oh, the duplic- 
ity! Got all the signs.” 

“Oh, he’s not like my brother, 
really,” Shirl said thoughtfully. 
“My husband doesn’t go out break- 
ing into liquor stores when he runs 
out, you know. But I don’t drink, 
and Butchie doesn’t drink, and so 
about all we ever have in the house 
is some cans of beer, and there 
aren’t any of those now.” 

Bermingham looked at her with 
angry disbelief. “You too! I smell 
it,” he said. “You going to tell me I 
don’t know what good old ethyl 
alcohol smells like?” 

“That’s the bin, Mr. Berming- 
ham. It’s a terrible mess, I know.” 
“Funny place to keep the crea- 
ture,” he muttered to himself, 
dropping to his knees. He dipped 
a finger into the drippings, smelled 
it, tasted it and nodded. “Alcohol, 
all right. Add a few congeners, 
couple drops of food coloring, and 
you’ve got the finest Chivas Regal a 
bellboy ever sold you out of a bottle 
with the tax stamp broken.” He 
stood up and glared at me. “What’s 
the matter with you, Dupoir? You 
not only don’t pay your honest 
debts, you don’t want to pay the 
bartenders either?” 

I said, “It’s more or less an acci- 
dent.” 

“Accident?” 


Then illumination struck. “Acci- 
dent you should find us like this,” I 
corrected. “You see, it’s a secret 
new process. We’re not ready to an- 
nounce it yet. Making alcohol out 
of old plastic scraps.” 

He questioned Shirl with his 
eyes. Getting her consent, he pour- 
ed some of Butchie’s baby-food 
orange juice into a glass, scooped in 
some of the drippings from the bin, 
closed his eyes and tasted. 
“Mmm,” he said judiciously. “Sell 
it for vodka just the way it stands.” 
‘‘Glad to have an expert 
opinion,” 1 said. “We think there’s 
millions in it.” 

He took another taste. “Plastic 
scraps, you say? Listen, Dupoir. 
Think we can clear all this up in no 
time. That fool Klaw, I’ve told him 
over and over, ask politely, don’t 
make trouble for people. But no, 
he’s got that crazy lawyer’s drive for 
revenge. Apologize for him, old 
boy, I really do apologize for him. 
Now look,” he said, putting down 
the glass to rub his hands. “You’ll 
need help in putting this process on 
the market. Business acumen, you 
know? Wise counsel from man of 
experience. Like me. And capital. 
Can help you there. I’m loaded.” 
Shirl put in, “Then what do you 
want our house for?” 

“House? My dear Mrs. Dupoir,” 
cried Mr. Bermingham, laughing 
heartily, “I’m not going to take 
your house! Your husband and I 
will work out the details in no time. 
Let me have a little more of that de- 


117 



lightful orange juice and we can 
talk some business.”

Joy, joy 

Chief! 

Cancel all I said. We’ve met 
Directive Two, the Host is happy, 
and we’re on our way Home! 

Warm 

up the breeding slings, there’s 
going to be a hot time in the old 
hammocks tonight. 

Garigolli. 

S traight as the flight of Ung- 
Glitch, the soaring vulture, that 
is the code of the jungle. I was 
straight with Mr. Bermingham, I 
didn’t cheat him. I made a hand- 
shake deal with him over the ruins 
of our Eco-Bin, and honored it 
when we got to his lawyers. 1 traded 
him 40% of the beverage rights to 
the stuff that came out of our bin, 
and he wrote off that little matter of 
$14,752.03. 

Of course, the beverage rights 
turned out not to be worth all that 
much, because the stuff in the bin 
was organic and alive and capable 
of reproduction, and it did indeed 
reproduce itself enthusiastically. 
Six months later you could buy a 
starter drop of it for a quarter on 
any street corner, and what that 
has done to the vintners of the 
world you know as well as 1 do. But 
Bermingham came out ahead. He 
divided his 40% interest into forty 


parts and sold them for $500 each 
to the alumni of his drunk tank. 
And Mr. Horgan — 

Ah, Mr. Horgan. 

Mr. Horgan was perched on my 
doorframe like Ung-Glitch await- 
ing a delivery of cadavers for dinner 
when I arrived that morning, bear- 
ing my little glass jar before me like 
the waiting line in an obstetrician’s 
office. “You’re late, Dupoir,” he 
pointed out. “Troubles me, that 
does. Do you remember Metcalf? 
Tall, blonde girl that used to work 
in Accounts Receivable? Never 
could get in on time, and — ” 

“Mr. Horgan,” I said, “look.” 
And I unscrewed my baby-food jar 
and dumped the contents on an un- 
popped pop-up Eco-Bin. It took 
him a while to see what was 
happening, but once he saw he was 
so impressed he forgot to roar. 

And, yes, the Fourteenth Floor 
was very pleased. 

There wasn’t any big money in it. 
We couldn’t sell the stuff, because 
it was so happy to give itself away to 
everyone in the world. But it meant 
a promotion and a raise. Not big. 
But not really little, either. And, as 
Mr. Horgan said, “I like the idea of 
helping to eliminate all the litter 
that devastates the landscape. It 
makes me feel, 1 don’t know, like 
part of something clean and 
natural.” 

And so we got along happily as 
anything — happily, anyway, until 
the time Shirl bought the merry-go- 
round. ★

JERRY POURNELLE, Ph.D. 


A STEP 

FARTHER 


SCIENCE FACT 



OUR FRIENDS THE ARABS 


E ditor Jim Baen tells me he’s on 
balance a political liberal. (That 
is Jerry's interpretation. I prefer to 
call myself a Constructive Anar- 
chist. I trust I make myself suffi- 
ciently obscure. ) It’s generally said 
that my views are conservative. Jim 
and I undoubtedly would disagree 
if we talked politics, which we 
haven’t; but we agree on the signi- 
ficance of the Arab oil boycott. 

It was one of the best things that 
happened to the United States in 
the last 20 years. 

No, this isn’t going to be a long 
editorial, but it seemed reasonable 
to get the editorial view out in the 
open before I start the column 
proper. 

The first favor the Arabs did us 
was to make the entire nation 
energy-conscious. Until the boy- 
cott, only a few scientists, and scat- 
tered conservation organizations, 
were at all concerned about the 
energy problem. 

In 1971 I wrote a series of 
columns and one major newspaper 
article about the coming energy 


crisis. The President’s energy mes- 
sage that summer contained several 
sentences (with crediting the source) 
from those. “The government” had 
plenty of figures, and officials were 
highly concerned, but their energy 
bills sat in Congressional commit- 
tees. The Congress is the most 
democratic of our branches of gov- 
ernment, and until the public 
worries. Congress does not. 

The average American didn’t — 
and doesn’t now — understand the 
energy problem. Until he had to 
wait in line for gasoline, it wasn’t 
his business. All that changed a few 
months ago, and even though the 
boycott has been lifted, we’ll never 
go back where we were this time 
last year, if for no other reason than 
the price of operating an automo- 
bile will keep energy costs ever 
before us. 

It has become fashionable to con- 
serve energy. People turn off lights, 
ride bicycles, form carpools. Speed 
limits have been lowered. Suddenly 
it is not only expensive, but down- 
right immoral, to waste energy. 


119 




This is all to the good. The more 
we conserve, the less we’ll have to 
find; and besides, it is immoral to 
waste a resource that took millions 
of years to form and which our 
grandchildren jmay need desper- 
ately. Energy conservation is a 
Good Thing, and we can thank the 
Arabs for not only reminding us of 
our duty, but making it expensive 
to shirk it. 

C onservation, however, isn’t 
going to save us from another 
energy crisis. We can talk until 
we’re blue in the face about using 
less energy, and we can turn out 
lights, and recycle steel (although 


sane politician who wants to run on 
a platform of “increased work for 
less pay”. We can philosophize and 
educate and pontificate all we 
choose, but the American worker 
expects more money for less work 
as he expects winter to follow sum- 
mer; and the only way to go from 
labor-intensive industry to some- 
thing else is for the something else 
to be energy-intensive industry. 

In order to talk intelligently 
about energy conservation, let’s see 
just where our energy goes. Table 
One gives the percentages for 1967, 
a good typical year and about the 
last one for which the figures are 
readily available.

(Does not add to 100% due to rounding) 


recycling many resources uses more 
energy than finding new ones), and 
ride bicycles, and do without elec- 
tric carving knives and tooth- 
brushes, and when we’re finished 
we might be able to cut the annual 
growth rate of energy consumption 
in half. This is a real saving, but it’s 
not the Earth. 

The reason we’ll continue to use 
more energy every year for a long 
time to come is that we live in a 
democracy, and there is not one 


Now those are fairly interesting 
figures. For one thing, they show 
that if we turned out all the lights in 
our houses and kept them off, 
never used home air conditioners, 
unplugged the refrigerators, and I 
learned to type on a manual again, 
we could save about 5% of the total 
energy needed each year. If we 
smashed all the neon lights and 
made all the shops do without elec- 
tricity, we could save 3% more, for 
a grand total of 8%. 


120 


GALAXY 



In practical terms, that would 
mean, at present requirement 
growth rates, that for two to four 
years we wouldn’t have to build any 
new power plants. Somehow it 
doesn’t seem worth it. 

On the other hand, gasoline sav- 
ing is worthwhile; we're working on 
the second largest item in the 
budget. The largest item, industry, 
pretty well takes care of itself, as 
fuel costs go up, industry will take 
drastic conservation steps simply 
from the profit motive. The only 
way we’ll cut much into industry’s 
share is by closing some industries 
altogether as frivolous — and every- 
one, strangely enough, seems to 
think the other guy’s job is frivolous 
and a good place to start. He never 
wants to eliminate his own. 

Another good area for saving is 
residential space heating. It’s over 
10% of the total, after all. But 
since we don’t want to freeze to 
death, we’ll have to think up other 
ways than simply shutting down 
our furnaces. 

We can insulate, of course. We 
can turn down the thermostats. But 
better we should stay comfortable 
and still save energy — and in many 
parts of the country that’s simple 
technologically. We simply put in 
solar heating systems. 

We've all seen designs for solar 
houses, and hot water heating sys- 
tems on the roof, and the rest of it. 
At the moment these are so expen- 
sive that only the wealthy can in- 
stall them — and unless they’re ec- 


centric, they don’t because they 
don’t have to. 

This has to change, and it can. 
Again it’s a question of economics. 
When the demand for such things 
is high enough, they can be made 
by mass production methods in- 
stead of by hand as they are pre- 
sently. 

We won’t save ourselves by stick- 
ing hot water heaters on every roof, 
but it does lead us to the real favor 
the Arabs have done us: not forcing 
us to conserve, but forcing us to 
think about the alternatives to what 
we’re doing now. Once that process 
starts I’ve enough confidence in 
American engineers — to be corny, 
in “good old American know- 
how” to be sure we’ll never go back 
to the smug, complacent, energy- 
wasting, fossil-burning, air-pollut- 
ing wasters we used to be. 

all right, what are the alterna- 
/V tives? At this point there arises 
a mighty chorus from science fic- 
tion readers as they chant the 
magic formula: FUSION! I’ll prob- 
ably hear it all the way out here to 
Studio City. Unfortunately, fusion 
is not the answer to our prayers. 

It’s very important, of course, 
and lately there have been break- 
throughs that make investment in 
fusion research very shrewd indeed. 
I’m not knocking fusion — but we’d 
be silly if we simply threw money at 
the fusion people, then sat back 
and relaxed. 


A STEP FARTHER OUT 


121 



In the first place, the most opti- 
mistic advocates of fusion don’t see 
it as an important source of power 
before 2010, and that’s a long way 
off. Cut that by 20 years, and we’re 
still in some trouble. Since we’re all 
friends here; let’s be frank about 
something: in any political crisis, 
and an energy crisis is primarily a 
political crisis, if there’s a choice 
between another Great Depression 
and anything else, anything else is 
going to be tried. 

Anything else specifically in- 
cludes: strip mining for coal; strip 
mining for oil shale; burning high 
sulfer oil in areas of bad air pollu- 
tion like my home town; crash pro- 
grams to throw in nuclear power 
plants without much regard for 
safety; ruthless exploitation of the 
Alaska north slope fields; frenzied 
off-shore oil drilling; and wars of 
conquest against oil-rich nations. 

R eforming the political system 
isn’t going to change that fact, 
either, unless by “reform” one 
means “making American policy 
less responsive to the will of the ma- 
jority of the American people.” 
Perhaps, if we changed the political 
structure so that it would be domi- 
nated by sober, thoughtful, right- 
thinking people like you and me 
and Jim Baen, we might reach a 
point at which we’d accept longer 
hours for lower wages, redistribute 
the jobs so we'll all have one, send a 
lot of people back to the farm to 
substitute human labor for high- 


energy food production methods, 
and — what’s that? I’ve lost my con- 
census already? 

Predsely. Let’s go back to tech- 
nology and leave politics for an- 
other time and place. 

We’ve agreed that fusion re- 
search is vital, and the experts seem 
agreed that it can’t be significant 
before the end of the century. 
What’s left? 

At the moment, there are three 
major sources of energy: hydro- 
electric, fossil, and nuclear. Of the 
three, hydro-electric can’t be ex- 
panded without environmental 
costs most of us aren’t prepared to 
pay, even though it is the least 
polluting of all those we have. The 
costs of increased hydro-electric 
power are such things as damming 
up the Grand Canyon, turning the 
few remaining wild rivers into 
chains of silting-up lakes, and 
generally making a mess of the 
water balance, not to mention the 
scenery. 

That leaves fossil fuels and nu- 
clear power, and here’s where I lose 
my concensus for the rest of the 
column. Nuclear power is a touchy 
subject, and immediately raises the 
highly important question: is it 
safe? 

No. 

In fact, “is it safe?” is precisely 
the wrong question to ask. Instead, 
we have to ask whether it is more or 
less safe than something else, in 
this case, great expansion of fossil 
fuels — or getting into the political 


122 


GALAXY 



crisis of Depression vs. anything 
else. 

For the past 25 years we have 
studied the dangers of nuclear 
power. The federal government has 
invested well over a billion dollars 
trying to measure the public health 
costs and dangers arising from nu- 
clear power plants. There are hun- 
dreds of reports on what might 
happen given one or another ac- 
cident; how many birth defects we 
can expect as a result of x number 
of nuclear plants; increased inci- 
dence of cancer as a result of nu- 
clear power; etc., etc. 

In the same time period there 
have been almost no studies of the 
public health costs and hazards of 
fossil fuel power plants, and those 
studies we do have get almost no 
publicity. 

This has to change. How can 
anyone make intelligent decisions 
without proper data? Unfortunate- 
ly, advocates of increased use of 
nuclear power — and I’.m one of 
those — have to use qualitative ar- 
guments because the numbers are 
not available. 

Let’s see what we do know. First, 
it’s easily shown that kilowatt for 
kilowatt, a coal-fired power plant 
releases more radioactive material 
to the environment than a nuclear 
power plant. This is because all 
coal contains small quantities of 
radium, and it goes up the flue. 

Those who wish to “stop nuclear 
pollution” counter by pointing out 
that nuclear plants produce spent 


fuels and other wastes which have 
to be stored, and sometimes the 
storage fails and the stuff gets out. 
There are two answers to that one; 
first, the wastes that do escape are 
concentrated in one place and rep- 
resent a hazard only to the nuclear 
workers — the “atomjacks” — and 

not the general public. 

Second, one of the soon-to-come 
developmetns in technology is the 
shuttle; and with that, and with 
proper application of nuclear waste 
solidification technology, nuclear 
waste disposal becomes a trivial 
problem; get rid of it forever by 
shooting it out into space. There’s 
lots of room out there. Obviously, 
due measures have to be taken to 
safeguard against accidents, but 
that’s not as hard as it sounds. 

We think of nuclear wastes as 
millions of gallons of liquids, be- 
cause that’s the way they’re stored 
now pending a safe permanent 
disposal system; but in fact all the 
waste products from all the power 
plants cumulative to date could be 
formed into a glass block about 40 
feet on a side. It would be a very hot 
block, both chemically and radio- 
actively, but it wouldn’t be dan- 
gerous except to those near it. 
Glass is a very stable compound. 

The arguments for and against 
nuclear power could go on all day, 
but the one clincher argument I 
would like to use rests on incom- 
plete data. Conceding that nuclear 
plants have public health costs, and 
that the wrong kind of accident 


A STEP FARTHER OUT 


123 



could cause deaths in the thou- 
sands, I would like to counter by 
showing that fossil plants already 
cause more deaths in a ten year 
period than would the kind of acci- 
dent to a nuclear plant that could 
happen only .once in a hundred 
years. 

It is reliably reported that 
lowered air quality reduces the 
average life span by three years. 
There are varying figures on how 
many people die from emphasema, 
lung cancer, general respiratory 
disease, and heart disease as a re- 
sult of the garbage put out by fossil 
plants, but many authorities think 
there are a lot. The most recent 
issues of Science indicate that nu- 
clear power, even with overesti- 
mates of the probability of a really 
severe nuclear accident, is sub- 
stantially less hazardous than coal; 
and they haven’t even looked at the 
probability that we might go to war 
if we rely on fossil fuels and then 
don’t have them. 

Let’s leave the subject of nuclear 
safety, but before I do, I’ll thank 
our friends the Arabs for making us 
think about that, too. We will 
presently have hard data to base de- 
cisions on; and when we do, I 
expect the public will be ready to 
look at the subject rationally, be- 
cause suddenly energy is important 
to the average man. 

S o far, then, the Arabs have 
forced us to look at conserva- 
tion, funded fusion research at over 


three times its previous level, got us 
thinking rationally about nuclear 
safety, and aimed some pretty 
bright people at the question of 
how to overcome nuclear safety 
problems. That’s a pretty good 
record — and it’s still not the biggest 
favor they did us. 

Beyond nuclear fission, beyond 1 
even fusion, there is a real problem 
with energy: the more we liberate, 
the more heat we release into the 
atmosphere. Exactly when man- 
produced heat will have a serious 
effect on climate varies with the ex- 
pert you talk to, but no one believes 
the problem will just go away. It’s 
probably time we did some serious 
thinking on the subject, if only to 
save trouble for our grandchildren. 
Besides, problems like that tend to 
go on for a long time and when you 
actually notice them, it may be too 
late to do anything — unless you’ve 
prepared in advance. 

As a direct result of the Arab- 
created energy crisis, the United 
States is blossoming with all kinds 
of exotic energy system research. 
We even have funds for windmills, 
and a 100 kw. wind-powered gene- 
rator will be constructed before the 
end of the decade. 

Don’t laugh. At the AAAS meet- 
ing last February I saw designs for 
enormous windmill systems to be 
mounted on barges and anchored 
in windy off-shore areas; and they 
are thought to be nearly competi- 
tive, economically, with fossil and 
nuclear systems.

We’re looking hard at geo-ther- 
mal power, and boring some new 
test wells. 

A new lens (well, lens-equivalent) 
that takes scattered light, such as 
daylight on a cloudy day, and 
focuses it finely enough to be used 
for heating, has been developed. 
Incidentally, the crabs beat us to 
that invention several million years 
ago, and biologists specializing in 
the visual systems of arthropods 
were instrumental in developing the 
lens. With such gadgets we can use 
solar heating even in cloudy areas. 

I ’ve mentioned in a previous 
column the possibility of using 
sea temperature differences for 
generating electricity; now that con- 
cept is getting serious study and 
there may be a pilot plant in a few 
years. This is one of the most inter- 
esting systems of all, because it 
makes use of a continuously renew- 
ed resource, sunlight, and adds pre- 
cisely nothing to the Earth’s heat. 
Moreover, the pollution product is 
fresh water and cheap protein. 

The solar power research teams 
are suddenly finding money to work 
on methods for turning sunlight 
into electricity that don’t require 
monstrous tracking mirrors and 
other costly gadgets. There's money 
for development of more efficient 
solar panels, the kind that power 
our spacecraft now; there’s no 
theoretical reason why a much 
larger percentage of sunlight can’t 
be turned directly into electricity. 


and with more efficient solar panels 
plus lower costs to orbit them, we 
may yet live to see space-based 
power plants. 

On a more prosaic level, coal re- 
search is getting almost an em- 
barrassment of riches. There’s 
money for gassification studies, 
more efficient fuel cells, new min- 
ing methodology, ways to clean up 
after the strip mines are finished, 
and more. 

Suddenly, the United States is 
energy conscious, and our talents 
and resources are aimed at new 
ways to get more energy for less 
environmental cost. I have a great 
deal of confidence in American 
technologists, and I’m confident 
that we’ll find not one, but many, 
new and better ways to run our 
power plants. 

The consequences of those dis- 
coveries will reach far outside the 
United States. We live in a small 
island of wealth set in the midst of a 
sea of poverty. The remedy for fa- 
mine and misery throughout the 
world will depend, at bottom, on 
low-cost energy. We weren’t look- 
ing for that so long as there was lots 
of cheap oil coming in from over- 
seas. Now we are, and when we find 
it, everyone will benefit. 

It may even be that historians 
fifty years from now will see this de- 
cade’s importance primarily in 
terms of energy research. Mean- 
while, I think we should all give 
three rousing cheers for our friends, 
the Arabs. ★ 


A STEP FARTHER OUT

As it was in the beginning . 


BIG BLACK WHOLE 

STEVEN UTLEY 


P ope irving ix, nee Curtis 
Wayne Hayakawa, Jr., was in 
the process of explaining to Com- 
mander Makmordic why it was that 
unlike the Holy Church the infidel 
Suth’n Babtists of Sol and Alpha 
Centauri did not have figurines of 
the Savior seated in their symbolic 
electric chairs when the lights sud- 
denly went out for a second. Two 
seconds later, a strident hoot from 
the bridge shocked Makmordic out 
of her surprise. 

Casting an apologetic look at His 
Holiness, the mistress of the S. V. 
Elhofi rose from her sling and de- 
pressed an intercom stud on the 
wall of her cabin. “Makmordic 
here," she whistled. “What is your 
matter?” 

"I'm not exactly certain. Com- 
mander,” came Sub-Commander 
Lcdicla’s deep, metal-raspy reply 
from the bridge. The statement was 
punctuated by a worried-sounding 
honk rather like the noise ancient 
Tcrran steam locomotives used to 
make when they contrived to fall off 
their tracks while traveling at high 
speeds. Dread immediately began 


to curdle and crawl about within 
Makmordic’s cassava melon- 
shaped thorax. She knew what her 
junior officer's nerve filaments were 
made of — after all. the sub-com- 
mander had served under her, not 
to mention at her side, during the 
recent war against those perfectly 
dreadful tripeds of Dasfis — as so 
she realized that whatever it was 
that could rattle the legendarily im- 
perturbable I.edicla certainly de- 
served her own respect. 

"We made the scheduled forty- 
light-year jump through unspace 
out from Stahl,” Ledicla continu- 
ed, “and were supposed to re- 
emerge within five xams' distance 
of our destination. However, 
though I have not yet been able to 
locale the error, we appear to have 
made some rather gross miscalcu- 
lation or another, for we have badly 
overshot Glom.” 

“Miscalculated?” Makmordic 
piped in questioning tones. “Over- 
shot?” 

“We have come out in deep 
space. Commander.” 

“Nch? Deep space?" 


127 



“Deep space?” echoed His Holi- 
ness, who now hovered behind 
Makmordic and nervously twirled a 
finely crafted electrofix on a gem- 
encrusted finger. “You mean, be- 
tween galaxies ?” 

“Deeper," Ledicla replied. “The 
deepest possible space, it seems. 
We appear to have emerged on the 
very rim of the universe itself!” 
“WHAT? " Makmordic’s shriek 
was accompanied by a burst of in- 
articulate orchestration from the 
Pope. 

“Off to port,” the sub-comman- 
der went on, “the galaxy clusters 
appear as a single billowing cloud 
of light, and — ” 

“Sub-Commander Ledicla, have 
you been licking the damper rods 
again?” Makmordic sternly de- 
manded. Ledicla’s sundry minor 
vices were known to her. Further- 
more, she could recall a time when 
his fondness for damper rods had 
greatly enhanced certain aspects of 
their former relationship. The radi- 
ation burns had been rather pain- 
ful, however, and so she had finally 
broken it off with him. Besides, he 
always became disgusting loopy 
when he had been on one of his 
damper rod-licking binges. 

“1 am merely reporting what I 
see,” Ledicla protested. “The — ” 
“Plug the image into my wall 
screen immediately!” 

“I regret to report that there is 
no image. Commander.” 

“Neh? Neh?” Makmordic’s nic- 
titating membranes started to click 


together spasmodically. "No 
image? 

“I am in the observation blis- 
ter,” Ledicla explained, “watching 
the phenomenon with my naked 
eyes. There is a great deal of noise 
emanating from the cloud. Elec- 
trons and protons. Most of the 
ship’s receptors screamed and 
shorted out at the instant we left 
unspace. The guidance systems 
have also been ruined. The Elbog is 
now on emergency power. 1 had to 
use the main generators to raise 
maximum density shields against 
the electron barrage. And — ” 

“I am coming to the bridge,” the 
commander hissed, menace in her 
tones. “Your breath had better not 
glow, I warn you, Ledicla.” 

As the commander switched off 
the intercom, Pope Irving began to 
tug gently at one of her armored 
joints. "What do your suppose the 
trouble is?” he asked in a quivering 
voice. 

“Aspergonk knows.” Makmor- 
dic sighed, shuddered and some- 
what reluctantly withdrew her joint 
from the Pope’s grasp. The Pope, 
being a pope and all, did not know 
about erogenous zones in general 
and the erogenous zones of Mak- 
mordic’s species in particular. She 
rubbed her joint tenderly for a mo- 
ment. “Whatever the problem is, I 
expect we'll soon know all about it. 
Will you accompany me to the 
bridge. Your Holiness?” 

His Holiness accepted the invita- 
tion, which was only a formality 


128 


GALAXY 



anyway. He could go anywhere he 
pleased aboard the Elbog. He was 
footing the bill for this trip. 

Makmordic turned and, with 
Pope Irving at her heels, scuttered 
purposefully from her quarters. 
Though her thorax continued to 
gurgle with disquiet, the pigmenta- 
tion was carefully chosen to display 
pleasantness and general well- 
being of spirit for the benefit of the 
passengers on board. None of the 
passengers seemed inclined to in- 
quire as to the significance of the 
momentary dimming of the lights. 
All of the passengers were theolo- 
gians with more important matters 
on their minds. The corridors of the 
Elbog thronged with beings ming- 
ling to exchange views on, and oc- 
casional blows over. Supreme En- 
tities. 

There were tree-root worship- 
pers, ear-wax enshriners, pterodac- 
tyl totemizers, apostles of Asper- 
gonk, battlers for Briquebat, con- 
verts to Camshaft. 

There were Zonds, Doowahs and 
Druids. 

There were two Quakers, a few 
Shakers and several fakirs. 

There were furry struiomimi, 
man-sized ostrichoid reptiles, who 
spent virtually all of their adult 
lives locked in ritual debate over 
whether or not the second (or per- 
haps it was the third) syllable of 
their particular Heavenly Progeni- 
tor’s Holy Name could be pro- 
nounced and. if so, by whom. 

There were sentient singing 


stones that had embraced the Holy 
Church’s teachings and now lent 
their soft, eerie harmonies to its 
songs. The air in the passageways 
throbbed subtly with “kyrie elec- 
tron, kyrie electron. ” 

All had been summoned to Glom 
by the head of the Church for what 
was discreetly referred to as the 
Third Inter-Species Ecumenical 
Council but what, in view of the 
Church’s recent expulsion from the 
vicinity of Sol and Alpha Centauri 
by the Suth’n Babtists, was ex- 
pected to turn out to be a bona fide 
council of war. Pope Irving IX was 
generally regarded as a patient, 
understanding individual, but even 
he had not quite been about to for- 
give and forget the way the accursed 
Babtists had sent him, via a neutral 
trading vessel, six bishops in thirty- 
six individually wrapped pieces. 

Accompanying the bishops had 
been a crudely penned note to the 
effect that the Babtists had suc- 
ceeded in coverting all sentient 
Solarians and Centaurians to the 
true faith. This had left a lot of 
cathedrals sitting around uselessly, 
so the Babtists had had them re- 
modeled and turned into bingo em- 
poriums. 

“This is not at all kosher of 
them,” His Holiness had grum- 
bled, and so the call had gone out 
to all non-Babtist-affiliated re- 
ligious leaders. 

The Babtists had naturally 
scheduled a council of their very 
own. 


BIG BLACK WHOLE 


129 



Actually, neither the Babtists nor 
the Church and its allies really 
wanted a war. Both sides were sort 
of hoping that the Supreme Being 
would be swayed toward whoever 
held the more impressive council 
and thus loose His/Her/Its wrath 
upon the losers, thereby settling the 
matter for all time. 

Cobalt-colored Ledicla stepped 
away from the observation blister 
as Commander Makmordic and the 
Pope entered the bridge, which 
stank of ozone and melted plastic. 
“I believe 1 was mistaken,” said the 
sub-commander, “when I reported 
that we somehow overshot Glom. 
Our calculations were probably 
correct, and we probably re-emerg- 
ed from unspace at the proper 
point. Glom, had moved.” 

He half-turned to indicate the 
observation blister with a noisy 
wave of an elbowless appendage. 
Ledicla’s metallic epidermis tended 
to squeak like rusty bedsprings 
whenever he moved. During the 
war against Dasfis, his racket had 
driven Makmordic bananas in less 
than a week; this was another 
reason for her breaking up with 
him. 

Makmordic and Pope Irving 
were struck speechless with awe 
and terror when they stepped into 
the observation blister and looked 
out. Off to starboard, there was no- 
thing, not a star, not so much as, a 
dust mote, nothing. Off to port was 
an immense sheet of bluish-white 
fire, shimmering in the firmament 


like an iridiscent curtain. In dia- 
meter, it must have been billions of 
light years and then some. Galaxies 
could be seen spiraling together in 
slow motion. Against the swirling,, 
shifting background of white flame, 
small points of light — stars — erupt- 
ed into short-lived red, yellow and 
orange blossoms as inconceivable 
tidal stresses ripped them apart. 
There were whirlpools and torna- 
does. It all looked very, very evil. 

“Even as we watch,” Ledicla 
rasped softly, “Space and Time are 
being twisted completely out of 
shape. It must have begun while we 
were in unspace, hence, our present 
position here on the fringe of 
things. By the time we came out in- 
to normal space, everything else in 
the universe had already been 
drawn together. That fire cloud is 
the whole of Creation. Note how 
with incredible swiftness everything 
is converging upon a central point. 
Ourselves included. Commander.” 

Makmordic wheeled to regard 
her junior officer with horror. “Can 
we not jump back into unspace and 
escape?” 

The sub-commander shook his 
head audibly. “The Elbog's con- 
trols are dead. We undoubtedly 
began to accelerate in the direction 
of the fire cloud as soon as we came 
out of unspace. Even with power, 
the ship probably could not escape 
the pull of the cloud’s core.” 
‘Core?" Comprehension flared 
in Makmordic’s light-sensitive or- 
gans. “You mean — ” 


130 


GALAXY 



Ledicla nodded solemnly, albeit 
somewhat noisily. “A black hole 
lies within the cloud. Is, in fact, 
responsible for the creation of the 
cloud.” 

His Holiness frowned with bewil- 
derment. “A black hole?” 

“A neutron star,” Makmordic 
piped dully. “When a sun, or, for 
that matter, anything capable of 
doing so, super-novas, it violently 
sheds its electrons and protrons. 
With nothing left to keep them 
apart any longer, the neutrons then 
implode into a dense little wad. A 
star the size of Glom, for instance, 
would be compressed into a heat- 
less, lightless ball not much bigger 
than a mung-pea. However, it 
would still retain approximately 
seventy per cent of its original 
mass. Anything which got too close 
would be sucked in, stripped of its 
own protons and electrons, then 
spread about one neutron thick 
over the surface of the original 
wad.” The mistress of the Elbog 
gently eased herself into an uncush- 
ioned seat. “How long do you esti- 
mate it will be before we feel its full 
effect. Ledicla?” 

The sub-commander pursed his 
shiny lips thoughtfully. He had 
overcome his initial horror of the 
sight in the heavens and now look- 
ed every inch the gallant officer 
who had unflinchingly induced ter- 
minal petrification in many a Dasfi- 
san. Makmordic loved him then 
and gathered her own courage. 

“We should,” Ledicla finally 


said, “disintegrate into atoms with- 
in the next five minutes and then 
into sub-atomic particles sometime 
shortly thereafter.” 

“Will it hurt?” whimpered the 
Pope as he sagged against the wall 
and let his electrofix slip from 
nerveless fingers. The two officers 
ignored him. 

“Just how big is the hole at the 
center of the cloud?” Makmordic 
quietly asked. 

“There is no way of determining 
its original size,” Ledicla replied, 
“But such instruments as are still 
functioning properly indicate that 
it’s now roughly four times as big as 
Betelgeuse.” 

“Great Aspergonk!” the com- 
mander whistled. “That would 
make it more than a billion miles in 
diameter!” 

“What could have made such a 
thing?” sobbed His Holiness. 
■'What?" 

Sub-Commander Ledicla shook 
his head and shrugged, making a 
sound like a loosely packed box of 
metal pans tumbling down a stair- 
case. “All the matter in the uni- 
verse probably wouldn’t be enough. 
We will, alas, never know just what 
it was that imploded into this black 
hole of black holes.” 

All around them, the A. V. Elbog 
began to hum and glow. 

“Dear God,” Pope Irving IX 
muttered, sliding to his knees. He 
would never know it, of course, but 
he had just answered his own 
question. *

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

In the 24th Century mankind has 
developed interstellar travel and is 
tackling the huge task of siphoning 
off Earth's excess population. Un- 
fortunately. only one other habit- 
able planet. Terra nova, has been 
discovered, and an economic brake 
has been placed on the flow of 
settlers to it by making the journey 
.highly expensive. This policy was 
introduced and enforced by the vast 
Starflight Corporation which con- 
trols all manufacture and operation 
of spacecraft. Most of the Starflight 
fleet is engaged in the transporta- 
tion of settlers, but it has a separate 
Stellar Exploration Arm which con- 
tinues with the search for habitable 
new worlds. The President of Star- 
flight. Elizabeth Lindstrom. is the 
richest and most powerful human 
ever. She has been debased and 
corrupted by her power to the ex- 
tent where — like sultans of old — 
she has been known to kill em- 
ployees for minor transgressions. 

VANCE GARAMOND, captain 
of the exploration ship Bissendorf, 
was about to leave Earth on a year- 
long mission and was summoned to 
Elizabeth’s headquarters for a pre- 
flight audience. While waiting im- 
patiently for his interview he was 
entrusted with the job of looking 
after Elizabeth Lindstrom' s small 
son, HARALD. Garamond, who 
was becoming disenchanted with 
the fruitless search for other planets 
was too busy with his own thoughts 


to notice Harald climbing up a tall 
statue. Before Garamond could 
prevent the accident, the boy fell 
and was killed. Garamond knew at 
once that not only was he doomed, 
but that the President's psychosis 
would prompt her to wreak ven- 
geance on his wife. AILEEN, and 
his own son. CHRISTOPHER. 

He discovered, however, that the 
boy's death fall had not been ob- 
served, so he hid the body and 
slipped away from Starflight House. 
Concealing his panic, he collected 
his wife and son from their apart- 
ment and took them to the space- 
port. At gunpoint he forced a 
shuttle pilot to fly them up to the 
Bissendorf which was waiting in 
orbit. Knowing that the dead child 
would be found at any moment. 
Garamond got through on the 
radio to his second-in-command 
and dose friend. CLIFF NAPIER, 
and ordered him to blank out all 
communications between the Bis- 
sendorf and Earth. The precaution 
was taken just in time — back at 
Starflight HQ Harold's body had 
been discovered. Elizabeth had al- 
ready slain the luckless servant who 
made the find, and had sent out an 
order that Garamond was to be 
brought back to her. 

Aboard his ship Garamond 
ordered it to leave the Solar System 
at maximum speed and was lucky 
in that the spatial “tide" was favor- 
able to him. The ships employed by 
Earth could operate more efficient- 
ly in regions where the density of 


133 



space was high, and in this case the 
local conditions enabled Garamond 
to escape his pursuers. The trouble 
was that he had nowhere to go — 
there was no point in fleeing to 
Terranova because Elizabeth's 
ships would .be there waiting for 
him. 

The Bissendorf was provisioned 
fora year, so Garamond decided to 
use that time to follow up a private 
dream. He owned photographs of 
partially destroyed starmaps which 
had been found on Sagania, a 
planet which had been destroyed by 
a nuclear reaction thousands of 
years previously. Discrepancies in 
the maps suggested to Garamond 
that one star had been of special 
significance to the long-dead Sa- 
ganians. and he decided to solve 
the mystery. 

On completing the four-month 
journey, the Bissendorf s crew 
made an astonishing find — a sun 
completely enclosed within a spher- 
ical shell which was more than 300 
million kilometers in diameter. 
They surveyed the object, located a 
single small entrance at its equator 
and one group passed through it to 
discover that the inner surface of 
the sphere was covered with vegeta- 
tion and had breatheable air. Hulks 
of hundreds of destroyed space- 
ships were clustered outside the en- 
trance and just inside it were ruins 
of ancient fortifications. A great 
battle had been fought there long 
ago. but there was no sign of life. 

The sphere, dubbed Orbitsville, 


appeared to offer perfect living 
space equivalent to many billions of 
Earths. The discover y elevated 
Garamond to a level of fame and 
importance at which he and his 
family seemed safe, even from 
Elizabeth Lindstrom. He sent a 
faster-than-light signal to Earth, 
reporting the jind. then his science 
team began to investigate some of 
Orbitsville's mysteries, including 
the puzzle of why radio communi- 
cation was impossible within the 
sphere. 

Four months later Elizabeth ar- 
rived at the head of a fleet, as- 
sumed control and in a tense inter- 
view with Garamond revealed that 
Starflight intended to exploit emi- 
gration to Orbitsville and parcel it 
out just as if it was a normal planet. 
Settlers begin to arrive almost im- 
mediately. Disillusioned and feel- 
ing useless. Garamond settled 
down with his family and watched 
the human settlement spread out- 
ward into Orbitsville's infinite 
prairies — then a new discovery was 
made. Orbitsville was not empty 
and free for the taking. An alien 
civilization was encountered close 
to the entrance. Communications 
could not be established with the 
gentle aliens unofficially called 
"Clowns But while they present- 
ed no threat, their settlement ring- 
ed the entrance and they were thus 
an obstacle. 

When reports began to appear 
on television describing a Clown 
massacre of humans on an outer 


134 


GALAXY 



planet, Garamond decided to act. 
It was obvious that the patently 
absurd reports were propaganda 
meant to prepare the human popu- 
lation for an attack on “ Clown 
City." He decided to take the 
Bissendorf to the outer planet to 
collect data that would disprove the 
reports. To his surprise Elizabeth 
Lindstrom offered no resistance to 
the plan. 

While on the outer planet Gara- 
mond was shocked to discover his 
wife had accepted an invitation 
from Elizabeth Lindstrom to stay 
with Christopher at the palace. 
Anxiously he hastened preparations 
for the return. The Bissendorf was 
over half way back when its field 
generators exploded, robbing the 
ship of its means of deceleration. 
They seemed doomed to ionize 
themselves on the impregnable 
outer shell of Orbitsville. but a 
desperate plan was put forth — the 
ship would be aimed at the en- 
trance to Orbitsville, its electron 
gun being used to create an atmos- 
pheric tunnel, 'thus enabling the 
Bissendorf to hurtle through the 
aperture, crash through Beachhead 
City and skip along the upper 
fringes of Orbitsville' s air shelf, 
gradually shedding velocity until it 
came to a stop. Beachhead City was 
evacuated and its inhabitants 
watched as the ship plunged into 
Orbitsville in an appalling display 
of violet fire. Elizabeth Lindstrom 
watched with not a little satisfac- 
tion what she believed to be Vance 


Garamond’ s funeral pyre. 

Five days later, the Bissendorf 
came to a stop, irreparably dam- 
aged by the ordeal but with most of 
the crew alive — fifteen million kilo- 
meters from Beachhead City. Re- 
cognizing the almost insurmount- 
able difficulties involved in return- 
ing over so immense a distance, 
most of the crew chose to remain 
and colonize the area where they 
landed. Garamond. however, de- 
cided to attempt to return to Beach- 
head City. For although he had no 
hopes of saving Aileen and Chris- 
topher from Elizabeth's vengeance, 
he had planned a revenge of his 
own. He intended to kill Elizabeth 
Lindstrom. 

He ordered that a fleet of ships 
be built from the wreck of the 
Bissendorf and that, in lieu o f radio 
communications, a way be found to 
guide the ships on the long journey 
back. The ship scientists under the 
direction of Chief Science Officer 
DENNIS O’HAGAN discovered 
they could get a bearing on Beach- 
head City by using delton particles. 

Since the crash, the crew’s time 
had had to be divided between 
Garamond' s project and the build- 
ing of a settlement — to their in- 
creasing dissatisfaction. Bitter and 
preoccu pied. Garamond did not 
notice the growing restlessness of 
the crew until after an accident oc- 
curred in the testing of one of the 
ships. He wus confronted by TROY 
LITMAN, his senior production 
executive. Litman accused him of 


ORBITSVILLE 


135 



keeping the men from the work 
necessary to their survival in the 
new colony, and of making harsh 
demands while remaining remote 
from the actual production of the 
project. The crew hacked Lit man in 
his criticism of Garamond and 
threatened to leave the ships itn- 
liitished. While Garamond manag- 
ed to talk the men into finishing, he 
recognized the truth in Lit man's 
accusations, and began to oversee 
the work himself. 

Soon after the confrontation with 
Litman a delta particle was record- 
ed. The ships were soon completed, 
and — despite warnings from O'- 
Hagan that the recording came too 
soon — Garamond set out on the 
return journey.

This is to be sort of a diary. But I 
am determined to avoid the abbre- 
viations traditionally used by 
diarists, abbreviations whose func- 
tion is to shorten a necessary task. 
My aim is to prolong a supertluous 
one. (The term “ship's log” might 
be more appropriate than “diary". 
But, again, a log is a record of the 
events of a voyage, whereas my 
daily entries are likely to concern 
only pseudo-events in a continuum 
of pure monotony.) (If 1 go on 
splitting hairs like this about the 
precise meaning of words in the 
opening sentence. I'll never get be- 


yond it; but the reference to abbre- 
viations isn’t quite right, either. 1 
intend to use the symbol “O” in- 
stead of writing out “Orbitsville” in 
full each time. O is much shorter 
than Orbitsville. but that is coinci- 
dental — it is also more expressive of 
the reality.) 

Cliff Napier was right when he 
guessed I was glad the job of manu- 
facturing autopilots was beyond 
our resources. My reasoning was 
that Hying the ship by hand would 
keep us occupied and help reduce 
boredom. It isn't working out that 
way, though. There are five of us on 
board and we spell each other at 
the controls on a rota arranged so 
that the two most experienced 
pilots, Braunek and myself, are in 
the dockpit at daybreak and night- 
fall. These are the only times when 
flying the ship is more difficult 
than, say, driving an automobile. 
Because day and night are caused 
by bands of light and darkness 
sweeping over the land at orbital 
speed there is no proper dawn or 
proper dusk, and some fairly violent 
meteorological processes take 
place. 

In the "morning” a sector of cold 
air which has been sinking steadily 
for hours suddenly finds itself 
warming up again and rising, caus- 
ing anything from clear-air turbu- 
lence to heavy rain. At nightfall the 
situation is reverse. It can be even 
more tricky because the air that 
cools and begins to descend con- 
flicts with currents rising from the

still warm ground. 

What it amounts to is that there 
are two half-hour periods when the 
control column comes to life. Not 
enough to occupy us for the next 
three to four years. I’m afraid, al- 
though we in the lead ship are a 
little luckier than the others. That 
is, we have a little extra work to do. 
There is the inertial course refer- 
ence to be monitored, for instance. 
A simple-looking black box, creat- 
ed by O’Hagan and his team. In- 
side it is a monomaniacal electronic 
brain that thinks of nothing but the 
bearing they fed into it. Any time 
we begin to wander off course, a 
digital counter instructs us to go 
left or right till we’re back on line 
again. The rest of the squadron 
follows suit. 

Linked to the black box is a one- 
meter-square delton detector which 
in a year or two, as we get con- 
siderably closer to Beachhead City, 
should begin to pick up other delta 
particles and provide course confir- 
mation. Sometimes I watch it, just 
in case, or just to pass the time, but 
there isn’t really any need. It would 
feed a fresh bearing into the course 
reference automatically. Also, it is 
fitted with an audio attention 
getter. I still watch it, though . 
and dream about EL. No abbrevia-

We have completed perhaps a 
fortieth of the journey, having 


llown a distance roughly equivalent 
to going around the Earth seven 
times. Without stopping. Another 
way to reckon it is that after 23 days 
we have gone nearly as far as a ray 
of light would have traveled in one 
second, but that's a depressing 
thought for anyone accustomed to 
Arthurian flight at multiples of 
lightspeed. A more positive thought 
is that we’ve learned quite a lot 
about O. 

Somehow I had always thought 
of it as composed entirely of fea- 
tureless prairie, but I was wrong. 
Perhaps it started off that way, 
eons ago, and the subsequent 
actin of wind led to the formation 
of the mountains we have seen. 
None were very high, not more than 
a couple of thousand meters, but 
with the land area of five billion 
Earths not yet explored who’s to say 
what will be found? Mountains are 
there, anyway, and some are 
capped with snow because our 
flight is taking us into the winter 
sector. In addition we sometimes 
sight rivers and small seas. Our for- 
mation passes over them in a dead- 
straight line, quietly and steadily, 
and sometimes the telescopes pick 
up herds of grazing animals. Per- 
haps early settlers will not have to 
rely exclusively on vegetable pro- 
tein, after all. 

The unexpected variegation of 
the terrain is making the journey a 
little easier to endure. But after a 
time all seas are the same, all hills 
look alike .

When I wrote in an earlier entry 
that the five of us in the lead ship 
were luckier than the others in 
having more to do, I was not think- 
ing about the members of the 
science staff. Sammy Yamoto in 
No. 4 seems- to be fully occupied 
with astronomical readings, includ- 
ing precise measurements of the 
width of the day and night bands as 
we cross them, or as they cross us. 
He now says that even with impro- 
vised equipment he could probably 
take a bearing on Beachhead City 
that would be accurate to within a 
degree or so. I suspect he is passing 
up his turn at the flying controls so 
that he can carry on with his work. 
I hope that is not the case, because 
he is one of the least expert pilots 
and needs the practice. Although 
five per ship is ample crew strength, 
this could be cut down, by illness 
for example, and I’m making no 
provision for unscheduled stops. 
Any ships that have to go down for 
long periods will be stripped and 
left behind. With their crews. 

Cliff Napier in No. 2 is filling in 
free time by helping Denise Serra 
record radiation and gravity fluc- 
tuations. 

Sometimes — in fact, quite of- 
ten — I find myself wishing Denise 
were on my ship. I could have ar- 
ranged that of course, but 1 had 
wanted to play fair with her. Hav- 
ing turned her down that night, I 
felt the least 1 could do was avoid 
obstructing the field. But now . 
now when I dream of Aileen and 


Chris, 1 dream they are dead. That 
means I'm beginning to accept it, 
and with the acceptance my prag- 
matic, faithless body seems to be 
nominating Aileen’s successor. I 
feel ashamed of that, but maybe 
the attraction is not as purely phy- 
sical as 1 was supposing. Delia Lig- 
gett, a catering supervisor on the 
Bissendorf, is on my ship and two 
of the other men on board have a 
good practical relationship with 
her — but 1 can’t work up much in- 
terest in a hot bunking system. I’m 
positive this isn’t a ridiculous rem- 
nant of a captain-to-crew attitude, 
a notion that 1 ought to have her ex- 
clusively because my uniform shows 
the most silver braid. 

Outside the agreed goals of this 
mission I have the old command 
structure, probably with some as- 
sistance from the pervading in- 
fluence of the Big O, completely 
discarded. 1 do remember, though, 
feeling some surprise at the make- 
up of the thirty-nine volunteers who 
came with me. My first supposition 
was that they would all be of execu- 
tive rank and above, career-orient- 
ed men and women determined to 
take the Bissendorf incident in 
stride. Instead 1 found that more 
than half the seventy original volun- 
teers were ordinary crewmen. 
Those chosen — by a selection pro- 
cedure that cut the number down to 
the precise requirement — I regard 
and treat as exact equals. 

O makes us equal. 

In comparison to it we are re-

Dtiv 54. Estimated Mnge: 6 20,000

We have completed our First 
scheduled landing and are in flight 
again. Alter fifty days in the air, 
the prospect of three days on the 
ground was exhilarating. We land- 
ed in formation on a level plain, the 
eight fully qualified pilots at the 
controls, and spent practically all 
the down-time gathering grass and 
loading it into the processing ma- 
chines. This is what passes for 
winter on O. The sun is still directly 
overhead, naturally. But with the 
days being shorter, the temperature 
does not build up as high and has a 
much longer time to bleed away at 
night. The result is a certain brisk- 
ness in the air during the day and 
nights actually cold. All of which 
makes me wonder why the design- 
ers of O bothered to build in a 
mechanism to provide seasons. If 
iily host el- for- the-galaxy notion is 
correct, presumably the designers 
made a survey of intelligent life- 
lorms in their region of space to see 
what the environmental require- 
ments were. And if that were the 
ease, the majority of life-bearing 
worlds must closely resemble 
liarth, even to the extent of having 
a moderately lilted axis and a pro- 
cession of seasons. Could this, for 
some reason I don't fathom, be a 
universal prerequisite for the evolu-

tion of intelligence? No, how could 
that be? Men had evolved in 
equatorial Earth regions where the 
seasons hardly varied. 

It seems that weather isn’t going 
to be any problem during future 
stops, but our physical condition 
might. The*simple task of cutting 
and gathering grass pretty well ex- 
hausted many of us. So we have 
worked up exercises that can be 
performed on board ship. 

Day 86. Estimated range: 1,038,000 
kilometers 

With more than a million kilo- 
meters behind us, it was beginning 
to look as though our journey time 
would be better than predicted. But 
the starboard propeller bearing on 
ship No. 7 has started to show 
wear. This is causing vibration at 
maximum cruise and we have had 
to reduce fleet speed by twelve kilo- 
meters per hour. The alarming 
thing is that the propeller-shaft 
bearings on all the ships are sup- 
posed to be Magnelube Alloy Grade 
E. It is inconceivable that a bearing 
made to that specification could 
show wear after only 83 days of con- 
tinuous running. The suspicion 
crosses my mind that Litman may 
have substituted Magnelube D, or 
even C. I cannot believe he would 
have done so out of pure malice. 
Probably there had been a shortage 
of blocks of the top-grade metal. If 
I had discovered that, I would have 
ordered a redesign or would have 
stripped some of the Bissendorf's 


main machinery to get the bear- 
ings. Either way, Litman would 
have had a lot of extra work on his 
hands, and the person he had be- 
come would not have taken kindly 
to that. 

We must now keep a careful 
watch on all propeller-shaft bear- 
ings because we carry no stocks of 
Magnelube Alloy and, in any case, 
barely retain the ability to machine 
it to the required tolerances. Like 
archaeologists burrowing deeper 
into the past, we are retrogressing 
through various levels of technical 
competence. 

Meanwhile the flight continues 
uninterrupted. Over prairies, lakes, 
mountains, seas, forests — and then 
over more and more of the same. A 
million kilometers is an invisible 
fraction of O’s circumference yet so 
enormous that contemplating has 
stunned my mind. I was taught at 
school that a man’s brain is unable 
to comprehend what is meant by a 
light-year — now I know we cannot 
comprehend as much as a light- 
second. So far on this journey we 
have, in effect, encircled twenty- 
five Earths; but my heart and mind 
are suspended, like netted birds, 
somewhere above the third or 
fourth range of mountains. They 
have run into the comprehension 
barrier while my body has traveled 
onward, heedless of what penalties 
may thus be incurred.

Like Litman, like the others, I 
am becoming a different person. 

I sometimes go for a whole day 
without thinking of Elizabeth Lind- 
strom. And now I can think of 
Aileen and Chris without experi- 
encing much pain. It is as if they 
are in a mental jewel box. I can 
take them out, examine them, re- 
ceive pleasure — then put them back 
and close the lid. Perhaps the life of 
a loved one must be considered 
algebraically — setting the positive 
total of happiness and contentment 
against the negative quantity repre- 
sented by pain and death. The 
equation, even for a very short life, 
can result in a positive expression. I 
wish I could discuss this idea with 
someone who might understand 
but Denise is on another ship. 

Dav 109. Estimated range: 
1.207,000 kilometers 

We have lost Tayman’s ship. No. 
6. It happened while landing for 
our second scheduled stop, putting 
down in formation on an ideal- 
looking plain. A hidden spar of 
rock wrecked one of Tayman’s 
skids, causing the plane to dip a 
wing. Nobody was hurt, but No. 6 
had to be written off. In future we 
will land in sequence on the lead 
aircraft’s skid marks to reduce the 
risk of similar incidents. Tayman 
and his crew — which includes two 
women — took the mishap philo- 
sophically and we spent an extra 
day on the ground getting them set 
up for a prolonged stay. Among the 


parts we took from No. 6 were the 
propeller-shaft bearings, one of 
which was immediately installed in 
No. 7’s starboard engine. 

So fleet speed is back to maxi- 
mum cruise. Still, the loss of Jack 
Tayman’s sturdy optimism is hard 
to accept. Strangely, I find myself 
missing his aircraft most at night. 
We have no radio altimeters or 
equivalents because the conditions 
on O will not permit electromag- 
netic transmission. Also, the envir- 
onment makes barometric pressure 
readings too unreliable. So we use 
the ancient device of two inclined 
spotlights on each aircraft, one at 
each end of the fuselage. The 
forward laser ray is colored red, the 
aft one white, and they intersect at 
five hundred meters, which means 
that a ship at the chosen height 
projects a single pink spot on the 
ground. Looking through the dark- 
ness we can see our V-formation 
slipping across the ground, hour 
after hour, a squadron of silent 
moons, and the disappearance of 
one of those luminous followers is 
all too apparent.

mayed but 1 think 1 can detect an 
undercurrent of relief at the possi- 
bility of so many aircraft having to 
drop out at the same time, thus 
providing for the setting up of a 
larger and stronger community. I 
have discussed the situation with 
Cliff Napier over the lightphone 
and even he seems to be losing 
heart. 

The only thing at all “hopeful” is 
that the ships in trouble are No. 3 
through No. 8, reflecting the order 
in which they came off the produc- 
tion line. The first and second 
ships — mine and Napier’s — are all 
right. It may be that Litman had 
enough Grade E metal available for 
our propeller bearings. I put 
“hopeful” in quotes because being 
reduced to two airplanes at this 
stage of the mission would be dis- 
astrous. It would take fairly com- 
prehensive technical resources to 
restore us to strength — resources 
not available. 

I am writing this at night, mainly 
because I can’t sleep. 1 find it diffi- 
cult to fight off a sense of defeat. 
The Big O is too . 

Garamond set aside his stylus as 
Joe Braunek, who had been in the 
cockpit serving as stand-by pilot, 
appeared in the gangway beside his 
bunk. The young man’s face was 
deeply shadowed by the single 
overhead light tube but his eyes, 
within their panda-patches of dark- 
ness, were showing an abnormal 
amount of white. 


“What is it, Joe?” Garamond 
closed his diary. 

“Well, sir . .” 

“Vance.” 

“Sorry, I keep ... Do you want 
to come up front a minute, Vance? 
There are some lights we can't ex- 
plain.” 

“Which panel?” 

Braunek shook his head. “Not 
that sort of light. Outside the 
ship — near the horizon. Looks like 
a city or something ahead of us." 

XVII 

at first sight the lights were disap- 
/V pointing. Even when Braunek 
had shown him where to look, 
Garamond had to scan the dark- 
ness for several seconds before 
managing to pick out a thin line of 
yellowish radiance. 

Delia Liggett, at the controls, 
raised her face to him, “Is there 
any chance that . .?” 

“It isn’t Beachhead City," Gara- 
mond said. 

“1 thought there might have been 
a mistake about distances.” 

“Sorry, Delia. We’re working on 
a very rough estimate of how far the 
Bissendorf traveled, but not that 
rough. You can start watching for 
Beachhead City in earnest a couple 
of years from now.” 

“Then what is that place?” 
Garamond perversely refused to 
admit excitement. “Who knows? 
Some natural feature, maybe.” 
“No,” Braunek said, handing 


142 


GALAXY 



Garamond a pair of binoculars. 
“Try these.” 

“It has to be an alien settle- 
ment,” Garamond admitted as the 
glasses revealed the beaded bright- 
ness of a distant city. “A hell of a 
ways from the aperture!” 

At that moment Cliff Napier’s 
voice came through on the light- 
phone. “Number Two speaking — 
do you read?” 

“I hear you. Cliff.” 

“Have you seen what we’ve 
seen?” 

"Yeah — and are you wondering 
what I'm wondering?” 

Napier hesitated. “You mean, 
what's an alien city doing way out 
here? I guess they got to Orbitsville 
a long time before we did. It might 
have taken them hundreds, even 
thousands, of years to drift out this 
far.” 

“Why did they bother? You’ve 
seen what Orbitsville’s like — one 
part is as good as another.” 

“To us, Vance. Aliens could see 
things a different way.” 

“I don't know,” Garamond said 
dubiously. He dropped into one of 
the supernumerary seats and fixed 
his eyes on the horizon, waiting for 
the wall of daylight to rush toward 
him from the east. When it came, 
about an hour later, sweeping over 
the ground with mind-paralyzing 
speed, the alien settlement abruptly 
became an even less noticeable fea- 
ture of the landscape. Although 
now only a hundred kilometers off, 
the “city” was reduced in the bino- 


culars to a mere dusting of varie- 
gated dots almost lost in greenery. 
During lightphone conversations 
among the aircraft there had been 
voiced the idea that it might be 
possible to obtain new propeller 
bearings or have the existing ones 
modified. Garamond himself had 
been quietly hopeful about the 
aliens’ level of technology— but his 
optimism began to fade. As the in- 
tervening distance shortened, the 
community hovering beyond the 
nose of his ship reminded him of a 
nineteenth century town in the 
American West. 

“Looks pretty rustic to me.” 
Ralston, the telegeologist, had 
borrowed the glasses and was peer- 
ing through them. 

Garamond nodded. “This is 
completely illogical, of course. We 
can’t measure other cultures with 
our own as a yardstick. But I have a 
feeling that’s a low-technology ag- 
ricultural community. I believe any 
race that settles on Orbitsville likely 
will turn into farmers. There’s no 
need to do anything else.” 

“Hold on a minute, Vance.” 
Ralston’s voice was taut. “Maybe 
we’re going to get those bearings, 
after all. I think I see an airplane.” 

Astounded, Garamond took the 
binoculars. After a moment’s 
search he found a complicated 
bright speck hanging purposefully 
in the lower levels of the air. The 
absence of any lateral movement 
suggested the other plane was fly- 
ing directly away from or directly 


ORBITSVILLE 


143 



toward his own, and his intuition 
told him the latter was the case. He 
kept watching through the powerful 
gyro-stabilized glasses and pres- 
ently saw other motes of colored 
brightness rising, swarming uncer- 
tainly, then settling into the "ap- 
parently motionless state that 
meant they were flying to meet him 
head-on. Ralston gave the alert to 
the six other ships of the fleet. 

“It’s a welcoming party, all 
right," he said as the unknown 
planes became visible to the naked 
eye, “and we’ve no weapons. What 
do we do if they attack us?” 

“We have to assume they’re 
friendly, or at least not hostile.” 
Garamond adjusted the fine focus 
on the binoculars. “Besides — I 
know I’m judging them by our 
standards again — but that doesn’t 
look like an air force to me. The 
planes are all different colors.” 

“Like ancient knights going out 
to do battle.” 

“Could be, but I don’t think so. 
The planes seem pretty small, and 
all different types.” A stray thought 
crossed Garamond’s mind. He 
turned his attention back to the city 
from which the planes had arisen, 
and was still scanning it with grow- 
ing puzzlement when the two fleets 
of aircraft met and coalesced. 

A green-and-yellow low-wing 
monoplane took up station beside 
Garamond’s ship and wiggled its 
wings in what, thanks to the stric- 
tures of aerial dynamics, had to be 
the universal greeting of airmen. 


The alien craft had a small blister- 
type canopy through which could 
be seen a humanoid form. Brau- 
nek, now at the controls, laughed 
delightedly and repeated the signal. 
The tiny plane near their wingtip 
followed suit, as did a blue biplane 
beyond it. 

"Communication!” he shouted. 
“They aren’t like the Clowns, 
Vance — we’ll be able to talk to 
these people.” 

“Good. See if you can get their 
permission to land,” Garamond 
said dryly. 

“Right.” Braunek, unaware of 
the irony, became absorbed in 
making an elaborate series of ges- 
tures while Garamond twisted 
around in his seat to observe as 
many of the alien ships as he could. 
He had noted earlier that no two 
were painted alike; now he was able 
to confirm that they differed radi- 
cally in design as well. Most were 
propeller-driven but at least two 
were powered by gas turbines and 
one racy-looking job had the ap- 
pearance of a home-made rocket 
ship. In general the alien planes 
were of conventional cruciform con- 
figuration although he glimpsed at 
least one canard and a twin-fuse- 
lage craft. 

“A bit of a mixture," Ralston 
commented, and added with a note 
of disappointment in his voice. “1 
see a lot of internal combustion en- 
gines out there. If that’s the level 
they’re at they won’t be much use to 
us.” 


144 


GALAXY 



“How about supplies of fossil 
fuel?” 

“There could be some about — 
depends on the age of Orbitsville.” 
Ralston surveyed the ground below 
with professional disgust. “My 
training isn’t worth a damn out 
here. The ordinary rules don’t 
apply.” 

“1 think it’s okay to go down,” 
Braunek said. “Our friend has 
dipped his nose a couple of times.” 

“Right. Pass the word along.” 

As the fringes of the alien settle- 
ment began to slide below the nose 
of the aircraft, Braunek sat higher 
in his seat and turned his head 
from side to side. “1 can’t see their 
airfield. We’ll have to circle 
around.” 

Garamond tapped the pilot’s 
shoulder. “I think you’ll find they 
haven’t got a centralized airfield.” 

T he aircraft banked into a turn, 
giving a good view of the 
ground. The city wheeling below 
the wing was at least twenty kilo- 
meters across but had no distin- 
guishable roads, factories or large 
buildings. Garamond’s impression 
was of thousands of hunting lodges 
scattered in an area of woodland. 
Here and there, randomly distri- 
buted, were irregular cleared areas 
about the size of football fields. 
The brightly colored alien planes 
dispersed toward these, crossing 
flight paths at low altitude in an 
uncontrolled manner that brought 


gasps from Braunek. They landed 
unceremoniously, one to a field, 
leaving the visiting ships still aloft 
in the circuit. 

“This is crazy — I’m not going to 
try putting us down in somebody’s 
back yard,” Braunek announced. 

"Find a good strip outside of 
town and we’ll land in sequence the 
way we planned,” Garamond told 
him. He sat back in his seat and 
buckled his safety straps. The 
plane lost altitude, completed two 
low-level orbits and landed, with a 
short jolting run on its skids, in an 
expanse of meadow. Braunek steer- 
ed it off to one side and they 
watched as the six other ships of the 
fleet touched down on the same 
tracks and formed an untidy line. 
Their propellers gradually stopped 
turning and canopies were pushed 
upward like the wing casings of 
insects. 

Green-scented air flooded in 
around Garamond and he relaxed 
for a moment, enjoying the sensa- 
tion of being at rest. The luxurious- 
ness of his body’s response to the 
silence awakened memories of what 
it had been like arriving home for a 
brief spell after a long mission. 
Ecstasy-living was a phenomenon 
well known to S.E.A. personnel, as 
were its attendant dangers. Rigid 
self-control was always required 
during home leave to prevent the 
ecstasy getting out of control and 
causing a fierce negative reaction at 
the beginning of the next mission. 
But in this instance, as he breathed

the cool heavy air, Garamond 
realized he had been tricked into 
lowering his guard . 

/ can t possibly take another two 
rears of flying night and day. the 
thought came. Nobody could. 

“Come on, Vance — stretch the 
legs,” Braunek called as he leaped 
to the grass. He was followed by 
Delia Liggett, Ralston and Pierre 
Tarque, the young medic who 
completed the crew of No. 1 . Gara- 
mond waved to them and made 
himself busy with his straps. 

Two whole years to go — at 
least.' — and what would it achieve? 

The sounds of laughter and 
cheerful talk came from outside as 
the crews of the seven aircraft met 
and mingled. He could hear friend- 
ly punches being swapped, and 
derisive whoops that probably sig- 
nified an overlong kiss being ex- 
changed. 

Even if l get near enough to the 
President to kill her. which is most 
unlikely, what would that achieve ? 
It's too late to do anything for 
Aileen and Chris. Would they want 
me to get myself executed? 

Garamond stood up, filled with 
guilty excitement, and climbed out 
of the glasshouse. From the slight 
elevation, the alien settlement look- 
ed like a dreamy garden village. He 
glanced around, taking in all the 
lime-green immensities, and 
dropped to the ground where Cliff 
Napier and Denise Serra were wait- 
ing for him. Denise greeted him 
with a warm, direct gaze. She was 


wearing regulation-issue black 
trousers, but topped with a tan- 
gerine blouse in place of a tunic, 
and more than ever he appreciated 
that she was beautiful. They were 
joined almost at once by O’Hagan 
and Sammy Yamoto, both of whom 
looked grayer and older than Gara- 
mond had expected. O'Hagan 
wasted no time on pleasantries. 

“We’re at a big decision point, 
Vance,” he began. “Five of our 
ships have sub-standard propeller 
bearings and if we can’t get them 
upgraded there’s no point in con- 
tinuing with the flight.” He tilted 
his head and assumed the set ex- 
pression with which he always 
received arguments. 

“I have to agree.” Garamond 
nodded, rediscovering the fact that 
looking at Denise soothed and de- 
lighted his eyes. 

O’Hagan twitched his brows in 
surprise. “All right, then. The first 
thing we have to do when we meet 
these aliens is assess their engi- 
neering capabilities." 

"They can’t be at the level of 
gyromagnetic power or magnetic 
bearings — you saw their aircraft." 

“That’s true, but I think I’m 
right in saying a magnelube bear- 
ing can be considerably upgraded 
by enclosing it within another bear- 
ing, even one as primitive as a ball 
race. All we would have to do is 
commission the aliens to manu- 
facture twenty or so large conven- 
tional bearings that we can wrap 
around our magnelubes,”

“They’d need to be of a standard 
size.” 

O’Hagan sniffed loudly. “That 
goes without saying.” 

“I think you’ll find . .” Gara- 
mond broke off as an abrupt 
silence fell over the assembled 
crews. He turned and saw a fantas- 
tic cavalcade approaching from the 
direction of the city. The aliens 
were clearly humanoid — and shar- 
ed the human predilection for 
covering their bodies with clothes. 
Predominant hues were yellows and 
browns that toned in with sand- 
colored skin, making it difficult to 
determine precise details of their 
anatomies. Some of the aliens were 
on foot, some on bicycles, some on 
tricycles, some on motorcycles, 
some in a variety of open and closed 
cars including a two-wheeled gyro 
car. Some were perched on an er- 
ratic air-cushion vehicle. They ap- 
proached to within twenty meters of 
the parked aircraft and came to a 
halt. As the heterogenous mixture 
of engines coughed, clanked and 
spluttered into silence, Garamond 
became aware that the aliens were 
producing a soft humming noise of 
their own. It was a blend of many 
different notes, continuously in- 
flecting, and he tentatively con- 
cluded that it was their mode of 
speech. 

Seen up close, the aliens ap- 
peared hairless but had identifiable 
equivalents of eyes, ears and 
mouths agreeably positioned on 
their heads. Garamond was unable 


to decide what anatomical features 
their flimsy garments were meant 
to cover, or to see any evidence of 
sexual differentation. He felt curi- 
ously indifferent to the strangers 
although this first contact looked 
infinitely more propitious than the 
wordless futility marking his en- 
counter with the Clowns. But, to 
him, no adventure in the outside 
universe could hold much signifi- 
cance compared to the voyage of 
discovery he was making within 
himself. 

"Do you want to try speaking 
with them?” O’Hagan said. 

Garamond shook his head. “It’s 
your turn to get your name in the 
history books, Dennis. Be my 
guest.” 

O'Hagan looked gratified. “If 
it’s to be done, best to do it 
scientifically.” He advanced on the 
nearest of the aliens, who seemed to 
regard him with interest. The 
movement of O’Hagan’s shoulders 
showed he was trying to communi- 
cate with his hands. 

“There’s no need,” Garamond 
said in a low voice. 

Yamoto turned his head. “What 
did you say?” 

"Nothing. Sammy. I was talking 
to myself." 

“You should be careful who you 
speak to.” Yamoto laughed. 

Garamond nodded abstractedly. 
The thing Dennis O'Hagan doesn’t 
realize about these people is that 
thev'll never do what he wants. He 
has missed all the signs. 


ORBITSVILLE

AH right — assuming we can't get 
them to make the bearings, is there 
anv point in continuing with the 
flight? Answer: no. This isn't just a 
personal reaction. The computers 
agreed that two airplanes of the 
tvpe available would not constitute 
a sufficiently flexible and resource- 
ful transport system. Therefore, l 
simply can't get back to Beachhead 
Citv. It's as clear-cut as that. It 
always was too late to do anything 
for Aileen and Chris, and now 
there's nothing I can even attempt 
to do. 

I've been born again. 

T he aliens stayed for more than 
an hour and then, gradually but 
without stragglers, moved away in 
the direction of their city. They re- 
minded Garamond of children who 
had been enjoying an afternoon at a 
fair and had become so hungry they 
could not bear to miss the meal 
waiting at home. When the last 
brightly painted vehicle disappear- 
ed behind the trees there was a mo- 
ment of utter silence in the mea- 
dow, followed by an explosive re- 
lease of tension among the plane 
crews. Bottles of synthetic liquor 
were produced and a party set off to 
swim in a nearby lake. 

“That was weird,” Joe Braunek 
said, shaking his head. “We stood 
in two lines and looked at each 
other like farm boys and girls at a 
village dance on Terranova.” 

“It went all right,” Garamond 


assured him. “There's no proto- 
col — what were we supposed to 
do?" 

“It still was weird.” 

“I know, but just think what it 
would have been like if there’d been 
any diplomats or military around. 
We met them, and stared at them, 
and they stared at us, and nobody 
tried to take anything that belong- 
ed to the others, and nobody got 
hurt. Things could have been 
worse, believe me.” 

“1 guess so. Did you see the way 
they kept counting our ships?” 

“1 did notice that.” Garamond 
recalled the repeated gesture 
among the aliens: long golden 
lingers indicating, tallying. 

“Seemed important to them, 
somehow. It was as if they’d never 
seen ...” 

“We’ve made genuine progress, 
Vance.” O’Hagan approached with 
a sheaf of hand -written notes and a 
recorder. “I’ve identified at least 
six nouns or noun-sounds in their 
speech and 1 believe I’d have done 
better if I’d had musical training.” 
“Can’t you get somebody to 
help?” 

“Yes. I’m taking Paskuda and 
Shelley and going into the city. We 
won’t stay long." 

“Stay as long as you want,” 
Garamond said casually. 

“All right, Vance.” O’Hagan 
gave him a searching glare. “I want 
to see something of their machine 
capability as soon as possible. I 
think that we could get a good idea 


148 


GALAXY 



of what’s available, don’t you?” 

“Excellent.” Garamond had 
caught a flash of tangerine farther 
down the line of aircraft. He 
quickly disengaged from O’Hagan, 
walked toward Denise Serra, then 
hesitated on noticing that she was 
involved in a discussion with the six 
other women of the flight crews. He 
was turning away when she glimps- 
ed him and signaled that he was to 
wait. A minute later she came to 
him. looking warm, competent, de- 
sirable and everything else he ex- 
pected a woman to be. The thought 
of lying with her caused a painful 
stab in his lower abdomen as glan- 
dular mechanisms, too long sup- 
pressed, found themselves reacti- 
vated. Denise glanced around her, 
frowned at the proximity of other 
people, and led the way towards an 
unspoiled area of tall grass. The 
quasi-intimacy of her actions 
pleased Garamond. 

“It’s good to see you again." 

"It’s good to see you, Vance. 
How do you feel now?" 

“Better, I'm coming to life 
again." 

“I’m glad.” Denise gave him a 
speculative look. “That was an of- 
ficial meeting of the Orbitsville 
Women’s League, detached chap- 
ter.” 

“Oh? Carry on, Sister Denise." 

She smiled briefly. ‘‘Vance, 
they've voted to drop out of the 
flight." 

"Unanimously?” 

“Yes. Five airplanes have to give 


up eventually, and we might as well 
pick the spot. The Hummers seem 
friendly, and making a study of 
their culture will give us something 
to do. Apart from bringing up 
babies, that is.” 

“Do you know how many men 
will want to stay?” 

‘‘Most of them. I'm sorry, 
Vance.” 

“Nobody has to apologize for the 
operation of simple logic.” 

“But that leaves you only two air- 
craft, which isn’t enough.” 

“That’s all right.” Garamond 
wondered how long he could go on 
in the role of martyr before telling 
Denise he had already come to 
terms with himself. 

She caught his hand. “I know 
how disappointed you must be.” 
“You’re making it easy to take,” 
he said. Denise released his hand 
instantly and he knew he had said 
something wrong. He waited im- 
passively. 

“Has Cliff not told you I’m 
having a baby?" Denise’s eyes were 
intent on his. “His baby?” 

Garamond forced himself to 
compose a suitable reply. “He 
didn’t need to.” 

“You mean he hasn’t? Just wait 
till I get my hands on the big . 

“I’m not completely blind, De- 
nise.” Garamond produced a smile 
for her. “I knew as soon as I saw 
both of you together this morning. I 
just haven’t got around to congrat- 
ulating him yet.” 

“Thanks, Vance. Out here we’ll 


ORBITSVILLE 


149 



need all the godfathers we can get.” 
“Can’t help you there. I'm 
afraid — I’ll be a few million kilo- 
meters east of here by that time.” 
"Oh!” Denise looked away from 
him. “I thought . .” 

“That 1 was quitting? Not until 
I’m forced to — and you know better 
than 1 do that th'e computers didn’t 
say two aircraft could not reach 
Beachhead City. It’s just a question 
of odds, isn’t it?” 

“So is Russian Roulette.” 

“I’ll see you around, Denise.” 
Garamond turned away, but she 
caught his arm. 

“I shouldn’t have said that. I’m 
sorry.” 

‘‘Forget it.” He squeezed her 
hand before removing it from his 
arm. “I really am glad that you and 
Cliff have something good going. 
Now, please excuse me — I have a 
lot of work to do.” 

G aramond had been occupied 
for several hours with the load 
distribution plans for his two re- 
maining aircraft when darkness 
came. He switched on the fuselage 
interior lights and continued work- 
ing with cold concentration, ignor- 
ing the sounds of revelry drifting 
into the cabin on the evening 
breeze. His fingers moved con- 
tinually over the calculator key- 
board as he labored through dozens 
of load permutations, striving to 
decide the best uses for his payload 
capability. The brief penumbral 
twilight had fled when he felt vibra- 


tions that told him someone was 
coming aboard. He looked up and 
saw O’ Hagan squeezing his way 
toward the small chart-covered 
table. 

“I’ve just discovered how much I 
used to rely on computers,” Gara- 
mond said. 

O’Hagan shook his head im- 
patiently. “I’ve just spent the most 
fantastic day of my life, and I need 
a drink to get over it. Where’s the 
supply?” He sat quietly while Gara- 
mond found a plastic bottle and 
handed it to him, then he took a 
short careful swallow. “This stuff 
hasn’t been aged much.” 

“The man who made it has.” 
“Like the rest of us.” O’Hagan 
took another drink and apparently 
decided he had devoted too much 
time to preamble. “We haven’t got 
a hope in hell of getting the bear- 
ings we need from these people. 
Know why?” 

“Because they’ve no machine 
tools?” 

“Because they make everything 
by hand. You knew?” 

“I guessed. They’ve got some air- 
planes, but no airplane factory or 
airport. They’ve got some cars, but 
no car factory or roads.” 

“Good work, Vance — you were 
way ahead on that one.” O’Hagan 
drummed his fingers on the table, 
the sound large the narrow confines 
of the cabin, and his voice lost some 
of its usual incisiveness. ‘‘They 
picked a road entirely different 
from ours. No specialization of 


150 


GALAXY 



labor, no mass production, no 
standardization. Anybody who 
wants a car or a cake-mixer builds 
it from scratch, if he has the time 
and the talent. You noticed their 
planes and cars were all different?” 
“Yes. I noticed them counting 
our ships, too." 

“So did I, but I didn’t know what 
was going on in their minds. They 
must have been astonished at see- 
ing seven identical models.” 

“Not astonished,” Garamond 
said. “Mildly surprised, perhaps. 
I’ve a feeling these people haven’t 
much curiosity in their make-up. If 
you allow only one alien per house, 
that city out there must have a 
population of twenty thousand or 
more. Yet I doubt if as many as two 
hundred came out to look at us to- 
day — and practically all those who 
came had their own transport.” 
“You mean we got the lunatic 
fringe.” 

“Gadgeteers, anyway — probably 
more interested in our aircraft than 
in us. They could be a frustrating 
bunch to have as next-door neigh- 
bors.” 

O’Hagan stared portentously at 
the paperwork scattered on the 
table. “So you intend to press on?” 
“Yes.” Garamond decided to let 
the single word do the work of the 
hundreds he might have used. 
“Have you got a crew?” 

“I don’t know yet." 

O’Hagan sighed heavily. “I'm 
sick to death of Hying, Vance. It’s 
killing me. But I’d go crazy if I had 


to live among folks who keep in- 
venting the steam engine every 
couple of years. I’ll fly with you.” 
“Thanks, Dennis.” Garamond 
felt a warm prickling in his eyes. 
“1 . .” 

“Never mind the gratitude,” 
O’Hagan said briskly. “Let’s see 
what sort of mess you’ve been mak- 
ing of these load distributions.” 

XVIII 

against Garamond’s expecta- 
tions, he was able to raise two 
crews of four to continue the flight. 
Again making use of the extra lift 
to be gained from cold air, the two 
machines took off at dawn and, 
without circling or giving any aerial 
signal of goodbye, they flew quietly 
into the east. 

Dav 193. Estimated range: 

2. 1 60, 000 kilometers 
This may be my last journal 
entry. Words seem to be losing 
their meaning, the act of writing 
them all significance. I notice that 
we have virtually stopped speaking 
to each other. The silence does not 
imply or induce separateness — the 
eight of us have compacted into 
one. It is simply that there is some- 
thing embarrassing about watching 
a man go through the whole point- 
less performance of shaping his lips 
and activating his tongue in order 
to push sound vibrations out on the 
air. It is peculiar, too, how a 
spoken word resolves itself into 


ORBITSVILLE 


151 



meaningless syllables, and how a 
single syllable can hang resonating 
in the air, in your mind, long after 
the speaker has turned away. 

1 fancy, sometimes, that the 
same phenomenon takes place with 
images. We have steered our ships 
above a thousand seas, ten thou- 
sand mountain fanges, all of which 
have promised to be different — but 
which all struck us as the same. A 
distinctive peak or river bend, a 
curious group of islands, the colo- 
ration of a wooded valley — geogra- 
phical features appear before us 
with the promise of something new 
and, having cheated us, fall be- 
hind. Were it not for the certainty 
of the inertial guidance system I 
might imagine we were flying in 
circles. 

No, that isn’t correct, for we have 
learned to steer a constant course 
against the stripings of the sky. We 
seem to exist, embedded, in a huge 
crystal paperweight and one of the 
advantages, perhaps the only one, 
is that we can tell where we are 
going by reference to its millefiori 
design. If 1 hold the milk-blue cur- 
vatures in a certain precise relation- 
ship, crossing windshield and prow 
just so, I can fly for as long as thirty 
minutes before the black box 
chimes and edges me to left or 
right. (The other black box, the 
portable delton detector, remains 
inert even after all this time. 
Dennis was right when he said we 
were lucky to find that first particle 
so soon.) 


The upcurving horizon provides 
a constant reference for level flying. 
It occurred to me recently that Or- 
bitsville is so big that we should not 
be able to detect any upward cur- 
vature in the horizon. As usual, 
Dennis was able to explain that it 
was an optical illusion — the hori- 
zon is virtually straight but, 
through a trick of perception, 
appears to sag in the middle. He 
told me that the ancient Greeks 
compensated for the effect when 
building their temples. 

The two aircraft are behaving as 
well as can be expected within their 
design limits. Each is carrying a re- 
serve powerplant which takes up a 
high proportion of its payload, but 
that’s unavoidable. A gyromagnetic 
engine is little more than a block of 
metal in which most of the atoms 
have been orchestrated to resonate 
in tune. It is without doubt one of 
the best general purpose medium- 
sized powerplants ever conceived, 
but it has a fault in that — without 
warning and for no apparent rea- 
son — the orchestra can fall into dis- 
cord and the power output drop to 
zero. When that happens there is 
no option but to install a new en- 
gine. We can afford it to happen 
only twice. 

F ortunately we have had only 
minor mechanical troubles, 
nothing serious enough to cause an 
unscheduled landing. But the po- 
tential is there and grows daily. 
The biggest cause for concern. 


152 


GALAXY 



however, is the biological machin- 
ery on board — our own bodies. 

Everybody except young Braunek 
is subject to headaches, constipa- 
tion, dizziness and nausea. Many 
of the symptoms are probably due 
to prolonged stress but, with in- 
creasingly unreliable aircraft to fly, 
we dare not resort to tranquilizers. 
Dennis in particular is causing me 
alarm, and an equal amount of 
guilt. 1 should never have brought 
him along. He gets grayer and more 
tired every day, grows less and less 
able to do his stint at the controls. 
The protein and yeast cakes on 
which we live are not appetizing at 
the best of times, but Dennis is 
finding it difficult to keep them 
down. His weight is decreasing 
rapidly. 

I am reaching the conclusion 
that the mission should be aban- 
doned. This time there are no emo- 
tional undertones in my thinking. I 
simply realize that the gamble is 
not worth the expenditure of 
human lives. 

A short time ago 1 could not have 
made such an admission. But that 
was before we had fully begun to 
pay for challenging the Big O. The 
journey we are attempting is per- 
haps only a hundredth of O’s cir- 
cumference, and of that tiny frac- 
tion we have completed only a frac- 
tion. My personal punishment for 
this presumption is that O has 
scoured out my soul. 1 can think of 
my dead wife and child; I can think 
of Denise Serra; I can think of 


Elizabeth Lindstrom . and noth- 
ing happens. I feel nothing. 

This is my last diary entry. 
There is nothing more to write. 
There is nothing more to say. 

K neeling on the thrumming 
floor beside O’Hagan’s bunk, 
Garamond said, “It’s summertime 
down there, Dennis. We’ve flown 
right into summer.” 

“I don’t care.” Beneath its cover- 
ing of sheets, the scientist’s body 
seemed as frail and fleshless as that 
of a mummified woman. 

“I’m positive we could find fruit 
trees.” 

O’Hagan gave a skeletal grin. 
"You know what you can do with 
your fruit trees.” 

“But if you could eat something 
you’d be all right." 

“I’m just fine — all I need is a 
rest.” O’Hagan caught Gara- 
mond’s wrist. "Vance, you’re not 
going to call of the flight on my ac- 
count. Promise me that." 

“1 promise.” Garamond disen- 
gaged the white, too-clean fingers 
one by one and stood up. The de- 
cision, now that it had come, was 
strangely easy to make. “I’m calling 
it off on my own account.” 

He ignored the other man's pro- 
tests and went forward along the 
narrow aisle to the blinding arena 
of the cockpit. Braunek was at the 
controls, Sammy Yamoto beside 
him in the second pilot’s seat. He 
had removed a cover from the del- 
ton detector and was probing inside 


ORBITSVILLE 


153 



it. Garamond tapped him on the 
shoulder. 

"Why aren’t you asleep, Sammy? 
You were on duty most of the 
night.’’ 

Yamoto adjusted his dark 
glasses. “I’m going to bed down in 
a minute — as soon as I put my 
mind at rest about this pile of 
junk.” 

“Junk?" 

“Yes. 1 don’t think it’s work- 
ing.” 

Garamond glanced at the de- 
tector’s control panel. "According 
to the operating light, it’s work- 
ing.” 

“I know, but look at this.” 
Yamoto clicked the switch of the 
main power supply to the detector 
box up and down several times in 
succession. The orange letters that 
spelled system functioning con- 
tinued to glow steadily in their dark 
recess. 

“What a botch,” Yamoto said 
bitterly. “You know, I might never 
have caught on if a generator 
hadn’t cut itself out during the 
night. I was sitting here about two 
hours later when all of a sudden it 
hit me — the lights on the detector 
panel hadn’t blinked with all the 
others.” 

“Does that prove it isn’t work- 
ing?" 

“Not necessarily — but it makes 
me doubt the quality of the whole 
assembly. Litman deserves to be 
shot.” 

“Don’t worry about it.” Gara- 


mond lowered himself into the 
supernumerary seat. “Not at this 
stage. We have to call off the 
llight.” 

“Dennis?" 

“Yes. It's killing him.” 

“1 don't want to seem callous, 
but — ” Yamoto paused to force a 
multiconnector into place — “don’t 
you think he may die anyway?” 

“1 can’t take that chance.” 
“Now I have to sound callous. 
There are seven other men on 
this . .” Yamoto stopped speak- 
ing as the delton detector emitted a 
sharp tap like that of a steel ball 
dropped onto a metal plate. He in- 
stinctively jerked his hand away 
from the exposed wiring. 

Garamond raised his eyebrows. 
“What have you done to it?" 

“All I’ve done is fix it.” Yamoto 
gave a quivering, triumphant grin 
as two more tapping sounds were 
heard almost simultaneously. 
“Then what are those noises?" 
“Those, my friend, are delta par- 
ticles coming through our screen." 
The astronomer’s words were punc- 
tuated by further noises from the 
machine. “And their frequency in- 
dicates we’re close to their source.” 
"Close? How close?” 

Yamoto took out a calculator 
and his fingers flickered over it. 
"I'd say about twenty or thirty 
thousand kilometers.” 

A cool breeze from nowhere 
played on Garamond’s forehead. 
“You don’t mean from Beachhead 
City." 


154 


GALAXY 



"Beachhead City is the only 
source we know. That’s what it’s all 
about.” 

“But ...” A fresh staccato out- 
burst came from the detector as 
Garamond, knowing he should 
have been excited, looked out 
through the front windshield of the 
aircraft at a range of low mountains 
perhaps an hour’s flying time 
ahead. They seemed no more and 
no less familiar than all the others 
he had seen. 

“Is this possible?” he said. 
“Could we have overestimated the 
flight time by two years?” 

Yamoto turned an adjusting 
screw on the delton detector, de- 
creasing the sound level of its ir- 
regular tattoo. “Anything is pos- 
sible on Orbitsville.” 

I t was late on the following day 
when the two stiff-winged un- 
gainly birds began to gain altitude 
to cross the Anal green ridges. All 
crew members, including a fever- 
ish-eyed O’Hagan, were gathered 
to watch as the mountain crests 
began to sink in submission to their 
combined wills. Changing paral- 
laxes made the high ground below 
them appear to shift like sand. 

Yamoto switched off the de- 
tector's incessant pelting with a 
flourish. "The instrument is no 
longer of any use to us. Astro- 
nomically speaking, we have reach- 
ed our destination.” 

“How far would you say it is, 
Sammy?” 


“A hundred kilometers. Perhaps 

less.” 

Joe Braunek squirmed in his 
seat, but his hands and feet were 
steady on the flying controls. “Then 
we have to see Beachhead City as 
soon as we clear this range.” 

Garamond felt the conviction 
which had been growing in him 
achieve a leaden solidity. “It won’t 
be there,” he announced. “I don’t 
remember seeing a mountain range 
this close to the city.” 

“It’s a pretty low range,” Ya- 
moto said uncertainly. "You 
wouldn’t have noticed it unless you 
had a specific ...” 

His voice faded as the ground 
tilted and sloped away beneath 
them to reveal one of Orbitsville’s 
mind-stilling prairies. In the hard 
clean light of the sun they could see 
to the edges of infinity, across 
oceans of grass and scrub, and 
there was no sign of Beachhead 
City. 

“What do we do now?” Braunek 
spoke with a curious timidity as he 
looked back at the other three men. 
The resilience that all the months 
of flight had not been able to sap 
now seemed to have left him. “Do 
we just fly on?” 

Garamond, unable to feel shock 
or disappointment, turned to Ya- 
moto. "Switch on the detector 
again.” 

“Right.” The astronomer reacti- 
vated the black box and the cabin 
immediately filled with a roar like 
drum-roll. “But we can’t change 


ORBITSVILLE 


155 



what it says — we’re right on tar- 
get.” 

“Is it directional?” 

“Yes.” Yamoto glanced at 
O'Hagan, who nodded tiredly in 
confirmation. “Swing to the left,” 
Garamond told Braunek. “Not too 
quickly.” The plane banked slowly 
to the north and, as it did so, the 
sound from the delton detector 
steadily decreased until it faded out 
altogether. 

“Hold it there! We’re now flying 
at right angles to the precise source 
of the particle bombardment.” 

Yamoto raised the binoculars 
and looked in the direction indi- 
cated by the aircraft’s starboard 
wing. “It’s no use, Vance. There’s 
nothing there." 

“There has to be something. 
We've got an hour of daylight left — 
take a new bearing and we’ll follow 
it till nightfall.” 

While Yamoto used the light- 
phone to bring the second crew up 
to date on what was happening, Joe 
Braunek steered the aircraft into its 
new heading and shed height until 
they were at cruise altitude. The 
two machines flew on for another 
hour, occasionally swinging off 
course to make an up-dated check 
on their direction. Toward the end 
of the hour, O’Hagan’s strength 
gave out and he had to be helped 
back to his bunk. 

“We messed it up,” he said to 
Garamond, easing himself down. 

Garamond shook his head as he 
spread a blanket over the older 


man’s thin body. “It wasn’t your 
fault.” 

“Our basic premise was wrong, 
and that’s unforgivable.” 

“Forget it, Dennis. Besides, you 
were the one who warned me we 
had no right to pick up that first 
particle so soon. As usual, you were 
right.” 

“Don’t try to butter me. I'm 
too . O’Hagan closed his eyes 
and seemed to fall asleep at once. 

Garamond made his way back to 
the cockpit and sat down to weigh 
the various factors pointing to the 
ending of the mission. He sensed 
that the resistance of the other 
men, which had surprised him ear- 
lier, would no longer be a consider- 
ation. They had allowed themselves 
to hope too soon, and Orbitsville 
had punished them for it. What 
remained now was the decision on 
where to make the final landing. 

His own preference was for the 
foothills of a mountain chain which 
would provide them with rivers, 
variety of vegetation and the psy- 
chologically important richness of 
scenery. It might be best to turn 
back to the range they had just 
crossed rather than fly onward over 
what seemed the most extensive 
plain they had encountered so far. 
There was the possibility that some- 
thing could go wrong with one of 
the aircraft when they were part 
way across that eternity of grass; 
and there was the certainty that 
what they would find on the far side 
would be no different from what 


156 


GALAXY 



they had left behind. Unless they 
came to a sea, Garamond reminded 
himself. A sea would add even 
more . 

“I think we’ve arrived." Braunek 
called over his shoulder. “I see 
something in front of us.” 

Garamond moved up behind the 
pilot and peered through the for- 
ward canopy at the Hat prairie. It 
stretched ahead, unbroken, for 
hundreds of kilometers. “1 don't 
see anything.” 

“Straight ahead of us. About ten 
kilometers.” 

“Is it something small?” 

“Small? It’s huge! Look, Vance, 
right there!” 

Garamond followed the exact 
line of Braunek’s pointing finger 
and a cold unease crept over him as 
he confirmed his belief that they 
were looking at featureless flat- 
lands. 

Yamoto shouldered his way into 
the cockpit. “What’s going on?” 
"Straight ahead of us,” Braunek 
said. "What do you think that is?” 
The astronomer shielded his eyes 
to see better and gave a low whistle. 
“1 don't know, but it would be 
worth landing for a closer look. But 
before we go down 1 want to get an 
infrared photograph of it.” 

Garamond examined the sand- 
smooth plain once more, and was 
opening his mouth to protest when 
he saw the apparition. He had been 
looking for an object which distin- 
guished itself from its surroundings 
by verticality and texture, but this 


was a vast area of grass that 
differed from the rest only in that it 
was slightly darker in color. It 
could have been taken for a natural 
variation in the grass, perhaps 
caused by soil composition, except 
for the fact that it was perfectly 
circular. From the approaching air- 
craft it appeared as a ghostly ellipse 
of green on green, like a design in 
an experimental painting. Yamoto 
opened his personal locker, took 
out a camera and photographed the 
slowly expanding circle. He reeled 
out the print, glanced at it briefly 
and passed it around for the others 
to see. On it the area of grass stood 
out darkly against an orange back- 
ground. 

"It’s quite a few degrees colder,” 
Yamoto said. “I would say that the 
entire area seems to be losing heat 
into space." 

“What does it mean?” 

“Well, the grass there is of a 
slightly different color — which 

could mean the soil is absorbing 
some mineral or other. And there’s 
the heat loss. Plus the fact that 
radiation from the outside universe 
is being admitted ... It adds up to 
just one thing.” 

“Which is?” 

"We’ve found another entrance 
to Orbitsville.” 

“How can that be?” Garamond 
felt a slow unexpected quickening 
of his spirit. “We did a survey of 
the equatorial region from the out- 
side. and besides . there’s no 
hole in the shell.” 


ORBITSVILLE 


1S7 



“There is a hole,” Yamoto said 
calmly. “But — a very long time 
ago — somebody sealed it up.” 

They landed close to the edge of 
the circle. Although darkness came 
flooding in from the east only a few 
minutes later, they began to dig an 
exploratory trench. The soil was 
several meters thick in the area, but 
in less than an hour an invisible 
syrupy resistance to their spades 
told them they had encountered the 
lenticular Field. Ashort time later a 
massive diaphragm of rusting metal 
was uncovered. They sliced through 
it with the invisible lance of a 
valency cutter. 

They levered out a square sec- 
tion. Then, without speaking, each 
man in turn looked downward at 
the stars.

<<rpms is North Ten, the most 
A. advanced of our forward dis- 
tribution centers,” Elizabeth Lind- 
strom said, a warm note of pride in 
her voice. “You can see at once the 
amount of effort and organization 
that has been put into it." 

Charles Devereaux walked to the 
parapet of the roof of the adminis- 
tration building and looked out 
across the plain. Four hundred kilo- 
meters to the south lay Beachhead 
City. The arrow-straight highway to 
it was alive with the small wheeled 
transports of settlers. Here and 
there on the road, before it faded 
into the shimmering distance, could 
be seen the larger shapes of bulk 


carriers bringing supplies. The 
highway ended at North Ten, from 
which point a series of dirt tracks 
fanned out into the encircling 
sweep of prairie. For the first few 
kilometers the tracks made their 
way through an industrial area 
where reaping machines gathered 
the grass used as a source of cellu- 
lose to produce plastics for building 
purposes. Immediately beyond the 
acetate factories, the homesteads 
began. The widely spaced dwellings 
sparkled whitely in the sun. 

“I’m impressed with everything 
Starflight has done here. My 
Lady,” Devereaux said, choosing 
his words with professional care. 
“Please understand that when I 
pose questions to you, I do so solely 
in my capacity as a representative 
of the Two Worlds Government.” 
Da you think I would waste time 
answering them otherwise? Eliza- 
beth suppressed the thought and 
bent her mind to the unfamiliar 
task of self-control. “1 do under- 
stand," she assured the dapper 
gray man, smiling. “It’s your duty 
to make sure that all that can 
possibly be done to open up Lind- 
stromland is in fact being done.” 
“That’s precisely it, My Lady. 
You see, the people on Earth and 
Terranova have heard about the 
fantastic size of Lindstromland. 
They can’t understand why it is 
that, if there is unlimited living 
space available, the Government 
doesn’t simply set up a program of 
shipbuilding on a global scale and 


158 


GALAXY 



bring them here,” said Devereaux. 

“A perfectly understandable 
point of view.” Elizabeth spread 
her hands to the horizons, fingers 
flashing with jewel-fire. “But this 
land I have given to humanity 
makes its own rules and we have no 
option but to abide by them. Lind- 
stromland is unthinkably large. Yet 
by providing only one entrance, 
and placing restrictions on interior 
travel and communications, its 
builders have effectively made it 
small. My own belief is that they 
decided to enforce a selection pro- 
cedure. As long as Lindstromland 
can accept immigrants only in 
regulated quantities the quality of 
the stock that arrives will be 
higher.” 

"Do you think the concept of 
stock and breeding would have 
been familiar to them?” 

“Perhaps not.” Elizabeth re- 
alized she had used an unfortunate 
trigger-word, one to which the up- 
start of a civil servant reacted un- 
favorably. It struck her that things 
had already gone too far when she. 
President of Starflight, was being 
forced to placate an obscure official 
in the weakest government in 
human history. The circumstances 
surrounding the discovery of Lind- 
stromland, she was beginning to 
appreciate, had been ill omens. 

Devereaux apparently was not 
satisfied. “It would be a tragedy if 
Earth were to export attitudes such 
as nationalism and . .” 

“What I’m saying,” Elizabeth 


cut in, “is that it would be an even 
bigger tragedy if we were to empty 
every slum and gutter on Earth into 
this green land.” 

“Why?” Devereaux met her eyes 
squarely and she made the dis- 
covery that his grayness had a steely 
quality. “Because the transporta- 
tion task would be too great to be 
handled by private concern?” 

Elizabeth felt her mouth go dry 
as she fought to restrain herself. 
Nobody had ever been allowed to 
speak to her in this manner before, 
with the possible exception of Cap- 
tain Garamond — and he had paid. 
It was infuriating how these small 
men, nonentities, tended to lapse 
into insolence the moment they felt 
secure. 

“Of course not,” she said, mar- 
veling at the calmness of her voice. 
“There are many sound reasons for 
regulating population flow. Look at 
the squalid difficulties there were 
when the first settlers here encoun- 
tered those creatures they call 
Clowns.” 

“Yes. but those difficulties could 
have been avoided. In fact, we 
think they may have been engineer- 
ed.” 

For one heady moment Elizabeth 
considered burning Devereaux in 
two where he stood, even if it led to 
a major incident, even if it meant 
turning Lindstromland into a for- 
tress. Then it came to her that he — 
in abandoning all the rules of nor- 
mal diplomacy — was laying his 
cards on the table. She regarded 


ORBITSVILLE 


159 



him closely, trying to decide if he 
were offering himself for sale. The 
approach, in greatly modified form, 
was a familiar one among govern- 
ment employees: show yourself to 
be dangerous and therefore valu- 
able in proportion. She smiled and 
moved closer to Devereaux, delib- 
erately stepping inside his proxim- 
ity rejection zone, a psychological 
maneuver she had learned at an 
early age. His face stiffened mo- 
mentarily, as she had known it 
would, and she was about to touch 
him when Secretary Robard ap- 
peared on the edge of the stairwell. 
He was carrying a headset and feed- 
ing wire out of a reel as he walked. 

Elizabeth frowned at him. 
"What is this, Robard?” 

“Priority One, My Lady. Your 
flagship is picking up a radio mes- 
sage you must hear.” 

“Wait there.” She moved away 
from Devereaux. The brusqueness 
of her man’s voice, so out of keep- 
ing with his normal manner, told 
her something important had hap- 
pened. She silently cursed the ob- 
tuse physics of Lindstromland that 
denied her easy radio contact with 
the outside universe. A voice was 
already speaking when she put on 
the headset. It was unemotional, 
with an inhuman steadiness, - and 
the recognition of it drained the 
strength from her legs. Elizabeth 
Lindstrom sank to her knees, and 
listened. 

“. using the resources of the 
Bissendorfs workshops, we built a 


number of aircraft in which to fly 
back to Beachhead City. The ships 
proved inadequate for the distance 
involved, but they got eight of us to 
the point from which I am making 
this broadcast. We have discovered 
here a second entrance to the 
sphere. 

“The entrance was not discover- 
ed during the equatorial survey be- 
cause it is sealed with a metal dia- 
phragm. The metal employed has 
nothing in common with the ma- 
terial of the Orbitsville shell. 1 be- 
lieve it is the product of a civiliza- 
tion no further advanced than our 
own. We had no difficulty cutting a 
hole in it to let us extend a radio 
antenna.” 

There was a crackling pause, 
then the voice emerged strongly in 
its relentless measured tones. 

“The fact that we were able to 
find a second entrance so quickly, 
with such limited resources, pro- 
bably means there must be many 
others. Many hundreds. Many 
thousands, possibly. It is logical to 
assume that all the others have 
been similarly blocked, and it is 
equally logical to assume that the 
blocking was not done by the 
builders of the sphere. 

“This raises questions about the 
identity and motivation of those 
who sealed the entrances. The evi- 
dence suggests that the work was 
carried out by a race of beings who 
found Orbitsville long before we 
did. We may never know what 
those beings looked like, but we 


160 


GALAXY 



can tell that they shared some of 
the faults of our own race. They, or 
some of them, decided to monopo- 
lize Orbitsville, to control it, to ex- 
ploit it; and the method they chose 
was to limit access to the interior of 
the sphere. 

“The evidence also shows that 
they succeeded for a time — and 
that, eventually, they failed. 

“Perhaps they were destroyed in 
the battle we know to have taken 
place at the Beachhead City en- 
trance. Perhaps in the end they lost 
out to Orbitsville itself. By being 
absorbed and changed, just as we 
are going to be absorbed and 
changed. The lesson for us now is 
that the entire Starflight organiza- 
tion — with its vested interest in 
curbing humanity’s natural expan- 
sion — must be cast aside. All of 
Orbitsville is open to us. It is avail- 
able as I speak . 

Elizabeth removed the headset, 
cutting herself off from the dread- 
ful, didactic voice. She put her 
hands on the smooth surface of the 
roof and sank down until she was 
lying prone, her open mouth press- 
ed against the footprinted plastic. 

Vance Gantmond, she thought, 
her mind sinking through succes- 
sive levels of cryogenic coldness. I 
have to love you . because you 
are the only one ever to have given 
me real pain, ever to have hurt me. 
You hurt me now. She moved her 
hips from side to side, grinding 
against the roof with her pubis. 
Now that all else is ending ... it is

"My Lady, are you ill?” The 
voice reached her across bleak in- 
finities. Elizabeth raised her head 
and, with effort, identified the 
gray, anxious face of Charles Deve- 
reaux. She got to her feet. 

“How dare you!" she said coldly. 
“What are you suggesting?” 
“Nothing. I . .” 

“Why did you let this person 
enter my quarters?” Elizabeth 
turned and stared accusingly at Ro- 
bard, who had quietly retrieved the 
headset and was reeling in the at- 
tached wire. “Get him out of here!” 
“I’m going — I’ve seen enough.” 
Devereaux hurried toward the stair- 
well. Elizabeth watched him go, 
twisting a ruby ring on her finger as 
she did so. It turned easily on bear- 
ings of perspiration. 

Robard bowed nervously. “If you 
will excuse me . ." 

“Not yet,” Elizabeth snapped. 


ORBITSVILLE

"Get me Doctor Killops on that 
thing.” 

“Yes, My Lady." Robard mur- 
mured into the instrument, listened 
for a moment, then handed it to 
her. He began to withdraw but she 
pointed at a spot nearby, silently 
ordering him to stay. 

Elizabeth raised the communi- 
cator to her lips. “Tell me. Doctor 
Killops, has Mrs. Garamond had 
her sedative today yet? No? Then 
don’t give it to her. Captain Gara- 
mond is returning, alive, and we 
want his wife to be fully conscious 
and alert for the" reunion.” She 
threw down the instrument and Ro- 
bard stooped to pick it up. 

“Never mind that," Elizabeth 
said quietly. “Get my car ready to 
leave in five minutes. I have urgent 
business in Beachhead City.” 

T he shock of hearing by radio 
that his wife and son were still 
alive had stormed through Gara- 
mond’s system like a nuclear fire- 
ball. In its wake had come relief, 
joy, gratitude, bafflement, renewal 
of optimism — and finally, as a con- 
sequence of emotional overload, an 
intense physical reaction. There 
was a period of several hours 
during which he experienced cold 
sweats, irregular heartbeat and 
dizziness; and the symptoms were 
at their height when the little tran- 
sit boat from fleet headquarters 
arrived underfoot. 

As had happened once before, he 
felt disoriented and afraid on seeing 


a spacesuited figure clamber up- 
ward through a black hole in the 
ground. The figure was followed by 
others carrying empty spacesuits. 
When the faceplates had been re- 
moved and the two parties were 
mingling, they still looked strange 
to him. At some time in the pre- 
ceding months he had come to ac- 
cept the thin-shouldered shabbi- 
ness of his own crew as the norm, 
and now the members of the rescue 
party seemed too sleek and shiny, 
too alien. 

“Captain Garamond?” A youth- 
ful Starflight officer approached 
him and saluted, beardless face 
glowing with pleasure and health. 
“I’m Lieutenant Kenny of the 
Westmorland. This is a great honor 
for me, sir.” 

“Thank you." The action of re- 
turning the salute felt awkward to 
Garamond. 

Kenny’s gaze strayed to the slop- 
ing stiff-winged outlines of the two 
aircraft and his jaw sagged. “I’m 
told you managed to fly a couple of 
million kilometers in those make- 
shifts. That must have been fan- 
tastic.” 

Garamond suppressed an illogi- 
cal resentment. "You might call it 
that. The Westmorland? Isn’t that 
Hugo Schilling’s command?” 

“Captain Schilling insisted on 
coming with us. He’s waiting for 
you aboard the transit boat now. 
I'll have to photograph those air- 
planes, sir — they’re just to . .” 

“Not now, Lieutenant. My Chief 


162 


GALAXY 



Science Officer is ill and must be 
hospitalized at once. The rest of us 
aren’t in great shape, either.” 
Garamond tried to keep his voice 
firm even though a numbness had 
enveloped his body, creating a sen- 
sation that his head was floating in 
the air like a balloon. 

Kenny, with a flexibility of re- 
sponse that further dismayed Gara- 
mond, was instantly solicitous. He 
began shouting orders and within a 
few minutes the eight members of 
the Bisscndor/'s crew had been suit- 
ed up for transfer to the waiting 
boat. Garamond’s mind was brim- 
ming with thoughts of Aileen and 
Chris as he negotiated the short 
spacewalk, with its swaying vistas 
of star rivers and its constrained 
breathing of rubber-smelling air. 
As soon as he had passed through 
the airlock he made his way to the 
forward compartment, which seem- 
ed impossibly roomy after his 
months in the aircraft’s narrow 
fuselage. Another spacesuited 

figure rose to greet him. 

“It’s good to see you, Vance,” 
Hugo Schilling said. He was a blue- 
eyed, silver-haired man who had 
been in the Exploration Arm for 
twenty years and treated his job of 
wandering unknown space as if he 
was the pilot of a local ferry. 

“Thanks, Hugo. It’s good 

to . ." Garamond shook his head 
to show he had run out of words. 

Schilling inspected him severely. 
“You don’t look well, Vance. 
Rough trip?" 


“Rough trip.” 

“Enough said, skipper. We’re 
keeping the suits on, but strap 
yourself in and relax — we’ll have 
you home in no time. Try to get 
some sleep.” 

Garamond nodded gratefully. 
“Have you seen my wife and boy?” 

“No. Unlike you, I'm just a 
working flickerwing man and I 
don’t get invited out to the Octa- 
gon.” 

“The Octagon! What are they 
doing there?” 

“They've been staying with the 
President ever since you . 
ah . disappeared. They’re cele- 
brities too, you know. Reflected 
glory, and all that.” 

“But ...” A new center of cold- 
ness began to form within Gara- 
mond's body. “Tell me, Hugo, did 
the President send you here to pick 
us up?” 

“No. It was an automatic re- 
action on the part of Fleet Com- 
mand. The President is out at 
North Ten — that’s one of the for- 
ward supply depots we’ve built.” 

“Will she have heard my first 
message yet?" 

"Probably.” Schilling pointed a 
gloved finger at Garamond. “Start- 
ing to sweat over some of those 
things you said about Starflight? 
Don’t worry about it — we all know 
you’ve been under a strain. You 
can say you got a bit carried away 
by the occasion.” 

Garamond took a deep breath. 
“Are there any airplanes or other 


ORBITSVILLE 


163 



rapid transport systems in use 
around Beachhead City?” 

“Not yet. All the production has 
been concentrated on ground cars 
and housing.” 

“How long will it take the 
President to get back to the Octa- 
gon?” 

“It’s hard to say — the cars they 
produce aren’t built for speed. 
Eight hours, maybe.” 

“How long till we get back?” 
“Well, I’m allowing five hours in 
view of Mister Q’Hagan’s condi- 
tion.” 

“Speed it up, Hugo,” Garamond 
said. “I have to be back before the 
President, and she’s had a few 
hours start.” 

Schilling glanced at the informa- 
tion panel on which changing color 
configurations showed that the ship 
was sealed and almost ready for 
flight. “That would mean fairly 
high G-forces. For a sick man . .” 
“He won’t mind — go ask him.” 
“I don’t see . .” 

“Suppose I said it was a matter 
of life or death?” 

“I wouldn’t believe you, but. .” 
Schilling winked reassuringly, 
opened an audio channel to the 
flight deck, and instructed the pilot 
to make the return journey in the 
shortest possible time consistent 
with O’Hagan’s health. Garamond 
thanked him and tried to relax in 
the G-chair, wishing he had been 
able to take the other man into his 
confidence. Schilling was kindly 
and uncomplicated, with a high re- 


gard for authority. It would have 
been difficult, possibly disastrous, 
for Garamond to try telling him he 
believed Elizabeth Lindstrom was a 
psychopath who would enjoy mur- 
dering an innocent woman and 
child. Schilling might counter by 
asking why Elizabeth had not done 
it as soon as she had had the 
chance, and Garamond would not 
have been able to answer. It would 
not have been enough to say that he 
felt it in his bones. He closed his 
eyes as the acceleration forces 
clamped down, but his growing 
conviction of danger made it im- 
possible for him to rest. Thirty 
minutes into the flight he got an 
idea. 

“Do you think there’ll be a re- 
ception when we get back? A public 
one?” 

“Bound to be,” Schilling said. 
“You keep hogging the news. Even 
while you were away a reporter 
called Mason, I think, ran a cam- 
paign to persuade somebody to go 
looking for your ship. The betting 
was ten thousand-to-one that you 
were dead, though, so he didn’t 
have much success.” 

Garamond had forgotten about 
the reporter from Earth. “You said 
my wife and boy are well known, 
too. I want them to meet me at the 
Beachhead City transit tube. Can 
you arrange that?” 

“I don’t see why not. There’s a 
direct communications link to the 
Octagon from the President’s flag- 
ship.” Schilling spoke into the 


164 


GALAXY 



command microphone of his space- 
suit, waited, spoke again, and then 
settled into a lengthy conversation. 
Only occasional whispers of sound 
came through his open faceplate, 
but Garamond could hear the ex- 
change becoming heated. When it 
had finished Schilling sat perfectly 
still for a moment before turning to 
speak. 

“Sorry, Vance.” 

“What happened?” 

“Apparently the President has 
sent instructions from North Ten 
that your family is to wait in the 
Octagon until you get there. She’s 
on her way there now, and they 
can’t contact her, so nobody would 
authorize transportation into the 
City for your wife. I don’t under- 
stand it.” 

“I think I do,” Garamond re- 
plied quietly, his eyes fixed on the 
forward view plate and its image of 
a universe divided in two by the 
cosmic hugeness of Orbitsville, one 
half in light, the other in total dark- 
ness. 

T he effort of moving under mul- 
tiple gravities was almost too 
much for Garamond, but he was 
standing in the cramped airlock — 
sealed up and breathing suit air — 
before the transit boat reached the 
docking clamps. He cracked the 
outer seal the instant the green dis- 
embarkation light came on, went 
through the boat’s outer door and 
found himself in a lighted I-shaped 
tube. It was equipped with hand- 


rails and, at the rounded corner 
where the sphere’s gravitation came 
into effect, there was the beginning 
of a non-skid walkway. 

Garamond pulled himself along 
the weightless section with his 
hands, forced his way through the 
invisible syrup of the lenticular 
field, achieved an upright position 
and strode into the arrival hall. He 
was immediately walled in by faces 
and bodies and, as soon as he 
opened his helmet, battered by the 
sound of shouting and cheering. 
People surged around him, reach- 
ing for his hands, slapping his 
back, pulling hoses and connectors 
from his suit for souvenirs. 

At the rear of the crowd were 
men with scene recorders. As he 
scanned their faces, an uncontroll- 
able impulse caused Garamond to 
raise his arm like a Twentieth Cen- 
tury astronaut returning from an 
orbital mission. He cursed the 
autonomous limb, appalled at its 
behavior, and concentrated on 
finding the right face in the bewild- 
ering, seething mass, aware of how 
much he had always depended on 
Cliff Napier in similar circum- 
stances. There was a high propor- 
tion of men in the uniforms of 
top-ranking Starflight officials, any 
of whom could have arranged 
transport to the Octagon, but he 
had no way of knowing which were 
members of Elizabeth’s inner cadre 
and therefore hostile. After a 
blurred moment he saw a heavy- 
shouldered young man with pre- 


ORBITSVILLE 


165 



maturely graying hair working his 
way toward him. Colbert Mason! 

“Captain Garamond,” Ma- 
son shouted above the background 
noise. “I can’t tell you how 
much . .” 

Garamond shook his head. “We 
can talk later. Have you a car?” 

“It's outside. 1 ’ 

“I’ve got to get out of here right 
now.’’ 

Mason hesitated. “There’s offi- 
cial Starflight transportation wait- 
ing” 

“Remember the first day we met, 
Colbert? You needed wheels in a 
hurry and 1 . 

“Come on.” Mason lowered his 
head and charged through the 
crowd like an ice-breaking ship. 
Garamond. hampered by the bulk 
of the suit, struggled in his wake. 
In a few moments they had reached 
a white vehicle with two worlds 
news agency blazoned on its side 
in orange letters. The two men got 
in, watched by the retinue that had 
followed them from the hall, and 
Mason got the vehicle moving. 

“Where to?” he asked. 

“The Octagon — as fast as this 
thing will go.” 

‘‘Okay, but I’m not welcome 
there. The guards won’t let my car 
in.” 

“I’m not welcome either, but 
we’re going in just the same.” 
Garamond began working on the 
zips of the spacesuit. 

That was a good line to hand the 
Press, he thought as the yammer- 


ings of panic began to build up. 
That was an authentic general-pur- 
pose man of action speaking. Why 
do I do these things? Why don't I 
let him know I’m scared shitless? It 
might makes things easier . 

Mason hunched over the wheel 
as the car sped through the indus- 
trial environs of the city. “This is 
the part you flattened, but they re- 
built it just as ugly as ever.” 

“They would.” 

“Can you tell me what’s going 
on?” 

Garamond hesitated. “Sorry, 
Colbert — not yet.” 

“I just wondered.” 

“Either way, you're going to get 
another big story.” 

“Hell, I know that much already. 
I just wondered ... as a friend.” 
“I appreciate the friendship, but 
I can’t talk till I’m sure.” 

“It's all right,” Mason said. 
“We’ll be there in less than ten 
minutes.” 

For the rest of the drive Gara- 
mond concentrated on removing 
the spacesuit. In the confines of the 
car it was an exhausting, frustrat- 
ing task which he welcomed be- 
cause it enabled his mind to hold 
back the tides of fear. By the time 
he had finally worked himself free, 
the octagonal building housing 
Starflight Center loomed on a hill- 
top straight ahead. He could make 
out the perimeter fence with its 
strolling guards. As the car gained 
height, and greater stretches of the 
surrounding grasslands came into 


166 


GALAXY 



view, Garamond saw that there was 
also a northern approach road to 
the Octagon. Another vehicle, still 
several kilometers away, was speed- 
ing along it, trailing a plume of 
saffron dust. It was too far away for 
him to distinguish the black-and- 
white silver Starflight livery, but on 
the instant a steel band seemed to 
clamp around his chest, denying 
him air. He stared wordlessly at the 
massive gate of the west entrance. 
The car slowed down as guards 
emerged from their kiosk. 

“Go straight through it,” Gara- 
mond urged. “Don’t slow down.” 
Mason said, “It would take a 
tank to batter down that gate — 
we’d both be killed. We’ll just have 
to talk our way in.” 

“Talk?” Garamond looked north 
and saw that the other vehicle 
seemed to be approaching with the 
speed of an aircraft. “There’s no 
time for talking.” 

H e leaped from the car as soon 
as it had slid to a halt and ran 
to the kiosk door at the side of the 
gate. A sun-visored guard emerged, 
carrying a ray gun, and stared 
warily at Garamond’s stained tra- 
vesty of a Starlight uniform. 

“State your business,” he said, 
at the same time making a signal to 
the other two guards seated inside. 

“I’m Captain Garamond of the 
Stellar Exploration Arm. Open the 
gate immediately.” 

The man’s mouth fell open. 

“I don’t know if I can do that, 


even for you, Captain Garamond.” 
“You’ve heard of me, haven’t 
you? You know who I am?” 

“I do know who you are. Cap- 
tain. I — I think you’re the greatest! 
But that doesn’t mean I should let 
you in. Have you an authoriza- 
tion?” 

“Authorization?” Garamond 
considered putting on a display of 
righteous indignation, but decided 
it would not work. He smiled and 
pointed at the dust-devil now within 
a kilometer of the northern gate. 
“There’s my authorization. Presi- 
dent Lindstrom is in that car, com- 
ing here especially to meet me.” 
“How do I know that’s true? I 
mean — ” 

“You’ll know when she finds out 
you wouldn’t let me through. I 
think I'll go back to my car and 
watch what happens.” Garamond 
turned away. 

“Just a minute.” The guard gave 
Garamond a perplexed look. “You 
can come in, but that other guy 
stays where he is.” 

Garamond shrugged and walked 
straight at the gate. It rolled out of 
his way just in time, then he was 
inside the perimeter and heading 
for the Octagon’s west entrance 
door, not more than a hundred 
paces away. A second before it was 
lost to view behind the flank of the 
building, he glimpsed the other car 
arriving at the north gate. It was 
black and silver, and he was able to 
see a pale feminine figure in the 
shaded interior. The certainty of 


ORBITSVILLE 


167 



being too late made his heart lapse 
into an unsteady, lumping rhythm. 
He was breaking into a run, regard- 
less of what the watchful patrolmen 
might think, when his attention 
was caught by a flicker of move- 
ment as a window opened in the 
transparent wall of the uppermost 
floor. Again he picked out a 
womanly figure, but this time it was 
that of his wife. And she was look- 
ing down at him. 

He cupped his hands to his 
mouth and shouted. “Aileen! Can 
you hear me?” 

“Vance!” Her voice was faint 
and tremulous, almost lost in the 
updraft at the sheer wall. 

“Pick up Chris and bring him 
down to this door as fast as you 
can.” He indicated the nearby en- 
trance. “Did you get that?” 

“Yes — I’m coming down.” 

Aileen vanished from the win- 
dow. Garamond went to the door, 
held it open and saw a short, de- 
serted corridor with four openings 
on each side. He debated trying to 
find stairs or elevator shaft, then 
decided that if he tried to meet 
Aileen part way he might miss her. 
Elizabeth was bound to be in the 
building by this time and on her 
way up to the private suite. Aileen 
and Christopher should be on their 
way down. But suppose there were 
only one central stairwell and they 
met Elizabeth head on? Garamond 
entered a chill dimension of time in 
which entire galaxies were created 
and destroyed between each thun- 


derous beat of his heart. He tried to 
think constructively, but all that 
was left to him was the ability to be 
afraid, to feel pain and terror 
and . 

One of the corridor doors burst 
open. He caught a flash of brown 
skin and multicolored silks, then 
Aileen was in his arms. We’ve 
made it, Garamond exulted. We’re 
all going to live. 

“Is it really you?” Aileen’s face 
was cool and tear-wet against his 
own. “Is it really you, Vance?” 

“Of course, darling. There’s no 
time to talk now. We’ve got to 
get . .” Garamond’s voice was 
stilled as he made the discovery. 
“Where’s Chris?” 

Aileen looked at him blankly. 
“He’s upstairs in his bed. He was 
asleep ...” 

“But I told you to bring him!” 

“Did you? I can’t think . .” 
Aileen’s eyes widened. “What’s 
wrong?” 

“She’s gone up there to get 
Chris. I told you to . .” Voices 
sounded behind him and Gara- 
mond’s hunting eyes saw that two 
guards had followed him nearly to 
the entrance. They had stopped 
and were looking up at the build- 
ing. Holding Aileen by the wrist, 
Garamond ran to them and turned. 
High up within the transparent 
wall, where Aileen had been a 
minute earlier, Elizabeth Lind- 
strom was standing, pearly abdo- 
men pressed against the clear plas- 
tic. She stared down, screened by 


168 


GALAXY 



reflected clouds, and raised one 
arm in langorous triumph. 

Garamond rounded on the near- 
est guard and, with a single con- 
vulsive movement, snatched the 
gun from his shoulder and sent him 
sprawling. He thumbed the safety 
catch off, selected maximum power 
and raised the weapon — just in 
time to see Elizabeth step back- 
ward away from the wall, into shel- 
ter. Garamond ’s eyes triangulated 
on his wife’s ashen face. 

“Is the kid’s room on this side of 
the building?” 

“Yes. I . .” 

“Where is it? Show me the exact 
place.” 

Aileen pointed at a wall section 
two meters to the left of where 
Elizabeth had been standing. The 
fallen guard got to this feet and 
came forward with outstretched 
hands, while his companion stood 
by uncertainly. Garamond pointed 
at the power setTing on the rifle, 
showing it to be at the lethal maxi- 
mum. The guard backed off, shak- 
ing his head. Garamond raised the 
weapon again, aimed carefully and 
squeezed the trigger. The needle- 
fine laser ray pierced the trans- 
parent plastic and, as he swung the 
gun, took out an irregular smoking 
area that tumbled flashing to the 
ground. 

A second later, as Garamond 
had prayed, a small pajama-clad 
figure appeared in the opening. 
Christopher Garamond rubbed his 
eyes, peering sleepily into space. 


Garamond dropped the rifle and 
ran forward, waving his arms. 

“Jump, Chris. Jump!” The 
sound of his hoarse, frightened 
voice almost obliterated the 
thought: He won't do it; nobody 
would do it. “Come on, son — I’ll 
catch you.” 

Christopher drew back his shoul- 
ders. A pale shape appeared be- 
hind him, grasping. Christopher 
jumped cleanly through the open- 
ing, into sunlit air. 

As had happened once before, on 
a quiet terrace on Earth, Gara- 
mond saw the childish figure falling 
and turning, falling and turning, 
faster and faster. As had happened 
once before, he found himself 
running in a slow-motion night- 
mare, wading, struggling through 
molasses-thick tides of air. He 
sobbed his despair as he lunged for- 
ward. 

Something solid and incredibly 
weighty hit him on the upper chest, 
tried to smash his arms from their 
sockets. He went down into dusty 
grass, rolling with the priceless bur- 
den locked against his body. From 
a corner of his eye he saw a flash of 
laser fire stab downward and expire 
harmlessly. Garamond stood up, 
treasuring the feel of the boy’s arms 
locked around his neck. 

“All right, son?” he whispered. 
“All right?” 

Christopher nodded and pressed 
his face into Garamond’s shoulder, 
clinging like a baby. Garamond es- 
timated he was beyond the effective

range of Elizabeth’s ring weapons 
and ran toward the gate without 
looking back at the Lindstrom 
Center. Aileen, who had been 
standing with her hands over her 
mouth, ran with him until they had 
reached the perimeter. The guards, 
frozen within tjheir kiosk, watched 
them with uncomprehending eyes. 
Colbert Mason was standing beside 
his car holding up a scene recorder. 
He glanced at a dial on the side of 
the machine. 

“That took two minutes less fif- 
teen seconds,” he said admiringly, 
then kissed the recorder ecstati- 
cally. “And it was all good stuff.” 
“The best is yet to come,” Gara- 
mond assured him, as they crowded 
into the car. 

G aramond, made sensitive to 
the nature of the benevolent 
trap, never again went far into the 
interior of Orbitsville. 

Not even when Elizabeth Lind- 
strom had been deposed and re- 
moved from all contact with so- 
ciety; not even when the Starflight 
enterprise had made way for com- 
munal transport schemes as natural 
and all-embracing as the yearly 
migration of birds to warmer 
climes; not even when geodesic net- 
works of commerce were stretched 
across the outer surface of Orbits- 
ville. 

He chose to live with his family 
on the edges of space, from which 
viewpoint he could best observe, 
and also forget, that time was draw- 


ing to a close for the rest of 
humanity. 

Time is a measurement of 
change. Evolution is a product of 
competition. Those concepts were 
without meaning or relevance in the 
context of the Big O. Absolved of 
the need to fight or flee, to feel 
hunger or fear, to build or destroy, 
to hope or dream, humanity soon 
was to cease being human — even 
though the metamorphosis would 
not take place within a single 
season. 

During Garamond' s lifetime 
there was a last flare-up of that 
special kind of organized activity 
which, had man not been drawn 
like a wasp into the honeypot, 
might have enabled his descendants 
to straddle the universe. There was 
a magical period when, centered on 
a thousand star-pools, a thousand 
new nations were born. All of them 
felt free to develop and flower in 
their own separate ways, but all 
were destined to become as one 
under the influence of Orbitsville' s 
changeless savannahs. 

In time even the flickerwing 
ships ceased to ply the trade lanes 
between the entrance portals, be- 
cause there can be no reward for 
the traveler when departure point 
cannot be distinguished from des- 
tination. 

The quiet of that last long 
Sunday fell over an enttre region of 
space. 

Orbitsville had achieved its pur- 
pose. ★

Gentlemen: 

In today’s mail I received the 
February 1974 issue of Galaxy. 
This is the first copy that I have re- 
ceived in over eight months. My 
subscription expired in October of 
1973 and I wish it to remain that 
way. 

Perhaps Science has caught up 
with the Science-fiction writers or 
perhaps it is me that has changed 
but it seems to me that the quality 
of the stories has deteriorated to the 
extent that I have given up on 
them. 

Perhaps the writers (good ones, 
that is) have either passed on or be- 
came too affluent. Where are the 
stories about Retief, Van Ryn, the 
Star Trader, the Rim Worlds, 
Stellar Colonization and etc. 

You are not the only one to feel 
my axe. I have been a subscriber to 
Analog ever since it started as 'As- 
tounding' but as of this August, I 
am cancelling for the reasons given 
above. 

My only reason for stating this as 


1 have is, perhaps it will build a 
little fire under someone that some- 
one else will benefit. 

Sincerely 
Myrum J. Mudgett 

P.S. In case you are wondering, I 
am 76 years of age and started 
reading Science Fiction in 1930 — a 
magazine put out by Hugo Gerns- 
back. 

MJM 

Since writing the above I have read 
The Man Who Killed Hope’. This 
is a good example of what I mean. 
That story would have better been 
put in Readers Digest Book of the 
Month Club. More about lawyers 
than Science Fiction. MJM 

As the new editor I am taking the 
liberty of sending you copies of 
June Galaxy and Worlds of IF in 
the hopes that you will be pleasantly 
surprised. / agree — sf has been 
better. But it is my firm belief 
that — certainly in this magazine ! — 
it will soon be better than ever!

Park City, 111. 60085 

April 23, 1974 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

At last, a decent science column. 
Galaxy can only benefit from A 
Step Farther Out, and I can think 


171 



of no one better qualified than Jerry 
Pournelle to write it. The man has a 
natural talent for putting across 
complex ideas in a form that excites 
and awes the reader. I personally 
would rather read his non-fiction 
than his fiction. 

I hesitate to say that, as I am 
fond of his fiction, but it’s difficult 
to find an author who can respond 
to my cravings for good science 
articles. Perhaps I represent a 
minority group, I don’t know. 

Recently I learned you have 
taken over as editor at Galaxy. 
(Best wishes.) Since the science 
column is a new addition, I feel a 
need to urge you to keep it, and I’d 
like to tell you why. 

Although I can speak only for 
myself, it should be safe to say your 
readers are more than casually 
interested in science. I would 
hazard a guess that most of the 
science and technology books of the 
popular variety are sold to sf 
readers. But beyond these books 
there are very few sources for a 
reader to turn toward. 'Popular 
Science'. 'Science Digest', and the 
like are apt to focus on readers with 
little interest in basic science. In- 
stead they publish reports on the 
latest innovations from Detroit or 
articles of the Sunday supplement 
variety. 

While this is fine for the general 
public, I don’t think it satisfies the 
average fan. He is already aware of 
most of the material these maga- 
zines print. But when he turns to 


find a more informative source, he 
has to make a standing broad jump 
into the technical journals. Now, 
most fans can follow these, I’m 
sure, but the journals are too point- 
ed, too limited in scope to be really 
satisfying. 

Thus, I strongly believe there is a 
demand among your readership for 
a middleground. Also, I think that 
after the column has been estab- 
lished your readers would look for- 
ward to it as much as the stories. 
(Especially a column in the hands 
of Dr. Pournelle.) There are other 
advantages — the association of 
good sf with hard science, a column 
the readers can anchor to in each 
issue, a sounding board for new 
ideas in the real world. 

Having gone this far, I’d also like 
to point out some of the things I’d 
like to see, and some I wouldn’t. 

First, historical of the Asimov 
variety. Before I cut Isaac’s 
column, let me praise it. Here is an 
example of the success a science 
column can produce. Certainly, 
Isaac’s column has been good for 
F&SF. I also buy that particular 
magazine, and the first thing I read 
in it is the science column. Perhaps 
it’s because of long association, but 
I’m always confident that, even if 
the fiction doesn’t do a lot for me in 
this particular issue, my money has 
not been wasted. 

However, history of science can 
get rather tiring after a while. I 
wish Isaac would write one book on 
science history, and then drop the 


172 


GALAXY 



subject. I am more interested in 
what is going on today. After all, 
over 90% of all science has been 
discovered and developed in this 
century. 

Next, a column, as opposed to 
freelance articles as found in Ana- 
log, offers a chance to explore 
subjects of interest in greater depth. 
The articles can be cascaded, and 
old material need not be repeated. 
For example, one of the subjects I’d 
like to see covered is propulsion 
systems. One article could deal 
with basic theory, not too difficult, 
and the next few could then exam- 
ine chemical rockets, laser, nuclear 
pulse, ion, fission pile, fusion drive, 
solar reflection, and then an article 
on pure speculation. The last article 
might examine the relative merits 
of each. 

Other subjects I’d like to see in- 
clude energy sources, the recent 
revolution in geology, advances in 
medicine, and anything and every- 
thing that deals with space travel. 

In fact, let me make one special 
plea. It irks me to the core to hear 
some ignorant fool make a state- 
ment like, “What good has the 
space program done for us. We 
spent billions for a bunch of 
rocks.” Unfortunately, my tongue 
ties itself in a knot when I try to 
destroy him. I would like to see one 
article that could point out in hard 
figures how well space has paid off. 
(Example, weather satellites alone 
have more than paid for it by saving 
billions in predicting hurricanes.) I 


would frame such an article. I 
would memorize it. 

Sigh. In summary, I want to app- 
plaud Galaxy for A Step Farther 
Out. With your guidance and Jerry 
Pournelle’s skill, the series can only 
be a terrific success. 

Always your friemi, fan, and 
follower, 

Daniel C. Smith 

You might also take a look at the 
August issue of Worlds of IF, 
wherein you will find Torchships 
Now, an article dealing with the 
application of pulse-fusion tech- 
niques to reaction drives for space- 
vehicles. This is the first in a series 
by Dick Hoagland, who has been, 
among many other things, Science 
Advisor to Walter Cronkite. The 
series is entitled, appropriately 
enough. REVOLUTIONS. (/ have 
been accused by one writer of 
having a prediliction for "gee whiz ” 
science-articles. I fear his accusa- 
tion may have a certain basis in 
fact . )

An Editorial Appeal 

Commencing with the June issues, Galaxy and Worlds of If 
will begin to fully show the results of an entirely new editorial 
policy. For example, the combined author line-up for June reads 
like a Who’.s Who of the field: Isaac Asimov, James Blish, Alexei 
and Cory Panshin, Fred Pohl, Lester del Rey, Mack Reynolds, 
Fred Saberhagen, James H. Schmitz, Robert Silverberg, Ted 
Sturgeon, Jack Williamson — and more! No mean list, I think 
you’ll agree. 

Check the contents-pages (themselves so changed as to be 
virtual new features) and you will find several additions. 

Galaxy: Forum, a platform for sf and/or science notables who 
feel they have something important — and interesting! — to convey 
to the readership; Interface, an intermittent series of interviews 
cum thumbnail biographies by Ted Sturgeon (scheduled to begin 
in July with an interview of Roger Elwood); Showcase, (also 
scheduled for July) a non-verbal feature — a new piece of sf-art 
by an acknowledged master, which has as its only justification 
that its creator thinks it’s something special. And of course Book- 
shelf, Directions and Galaxy Stars will continue to flourish as of 
yore — more than yore, in fact. 

Worlds of If: The Alien Viewpoint, an insider’s view of sf. 
Crusty, hard-bitten, cynical old Dick Geis (Editor/Publisher of 
The Alien Critic ) lays it on the line — his opinions are not neces- 
sarily those of the management! Ars Gratia, much like Galaxy 
Showcase, but for Up-and-Comers; Future Perfect, next issue’s 
goodies — at least some of them; The Editor’s Page in June is 
devoted to my personal favorite among the many past editors of 
Worlds of If. In future, it will be what the name implies — the 
editor’s page. And, as with Galaxy, all the old features will re- 
main in residence. 

But all of this takes money, a good deal of it — and the profit 
motive remains an operant factor in the publishing industry. To

membership will be cancelled 
and you’ll owe nothing. 

About every 4 weeks (14 
times a year), we’ll send you 
the Club’s bulletin describing 
the 2 coming Selections and 
Alternate choices. If you want 
both Selections, you need do 
nothing; they’ll be shipped 
automatically. If you don’t want 


a Selection, or prefer an Alter- 
nate, or no book at all, just fill 
out the form provided, and re- 
turn it to us by the date speci- 
fied. We try to allow you at least 
ten days for making your de- 
cision. If you don’t get the form 
in time to respond within 10 
days, and receive an unwanted 
selection, you may return it at 
our expense. 

As a member you need take 
only 4 Selections or Alternates 
during the coming year. You 
may resign any time thereafter, 
or continue membership. Most 
books cost only $1.98, plus 
shipping and handling. Occa- 
sionally, extra-value Selections 
are slightly higher. So join now. 
Send no money. But mail the 
coupon today.
