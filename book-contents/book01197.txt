Robinette Broadhead had won a lottery. His

(but not in comfort) for the rest of his life or to 
purchase a one-way ticket to Gateway, where 
wealth and fame — or death — awaited. 

Robinette chose glory. Trouble is, he seems to 
have used up his nerve in making that choice.

EDITORIAL 



It was recently remarked to me that the conquest 
of Space offered a challenge so vast that the 
human spirit must quail before it. I disagreed 
vehemently, on the grounds that while that chal- 
lenge is indeed infinite, so too are our spiritual 
resources. I did allow however, that it would 
take quite literally everything we’ve got to offer, 
including, most especially, our religious im- 
pulses. In light of the foregoing (and with no lit- 
tle trepidation) I offer an — 

EPISTLE TO THE CHRISTIANS 



In every age the myths and legends — or sacred truths, if you prefer — of 
times past must be reinterpreted in the light of new knowledge and beliefs, 
if they are to remain meaningful for the men and women of that new age. 
Thus if God indeed spoke unto the Prophets of Israel (and for the moment 
let us assume that he did), think of all the things He could not say directly, 
simply . because those Prophets, wise as they may have been, were simply 
not equipped with the knowledge necessary for comprehension. Had He 
spake unto them of pulsars and planets, Trojan Points and star-probes, He 
had spake unto them gibberish. It follows that if the Bible is to be as rele- 
vant to the Age of Science as it was to the Late Neolithic, its wisdom must 
be extracted and extrapolated: if God spoke to us. He spoke in parables; He 
had no choice. 

Consider in this regard Genesis 1:28 : “Be fruitful, and multiply, and re- 
plenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the 
sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth 
upon the earth.” Consider especially the word ‘earth.’ To a man of 5,000 
years ago, the concept that the translators of the King James Version chose 
to render as ‘earth’ might have been rendered as well (in meaning, not 
beauty!) as ‘all lands,’ ‘all ground,’ or ‘all places where a man can walk.’ 
What it could not have been rendered as is ‘Earth’ with a capital, or ‘this 
planet’; in 3,000 B.C. the concept was lacking. The modem equivalent 
would be ‘available habitats’: places where people can live. 

And just what habitats are available to us? Well, Dr. Gerard O’Neil 
has published a nuts-and-bolts proposal detailing how we can with present

CHANCE MEETING NEAR ARARAT 



Chance 
iliectiiMi 
— Wear 
Ararat 



True, the aliens were primitive, 
but there was something about 
them. 



They doomed themselves in a 
myriad of ways. Perhaps it was in 
their nature to seek incompleteness 
instead of the whole. The rift grew, 
and led them to use up and foul 
rather than maintain and enrich. 

Not alone did they pass. All else 
that shared their precious gift they 
dragged down with them, all but the 
mean things that evolved or adapted 
to dwell amid the ruin. 

But in their last days, driven by 
the need for racial continuity that 
was their ultimate defense against 
mortality, they constructed me. 

No, that isn’t exactly right. That 
which they built isn’t I, no more 
than the protoplasmic casings were 
they. 

They created a final servant. But 
/ am more than that. Did they 
realize? Did they plan it that way? 

1 will never know. 

The starbow spread colorfully in 
the forward screen, flattened and 
stretched by .86 c. Ap Retalia was 
decelerating from trans-light 
velocity — or had been, before spot- 
ting the bogie. The bridge was on 
combat alert; all six Command 
Level officers were wrapped into 
their stations. 



Captain Reta hung tensely in the 
central chair of the circular 
chamber. His tail coiled around the 
back brace, while his triple-jointed 
legs were hooked over the side 
bars. His azure body-fur stood 
tautly erect. “Well, Rho? Is it a 
Poorg unit?” 

The underCaptain-Astrogation 
flicked out her tongue negatively. 
“Not unless it’s some sort of trick. 
For one thing, why would they be 
way out here in interstellaria poking 
along at sub-c?” 

“Who can guess at Poorg mo- 
tives? We don’t even know why 
they’re bent on genocide. Maybe 
they came out here to commune 
with the divinity of their choice.” 

“Not in that ore shuttle!” Rho 
snapped. “Wrong course, for one 
thing — it’s coming in from the Rim. 
But more importantly, the drive is 
something I’ve never seen before.” 

“How so?” 

“No fusion flare. They can’t be 
baffling it, not at this range. 
There’s a hydrogen scoop up front, 
but it’s material — no trace of a col- 
lector field.” 

Reta’s tail tip twitched nervously. 
“It’s taking in interstellar matter, 
but not for a fusion drive. Why? 
Let’s have a closer look,” 

Rho’s subtentacles played over 
her board. A new segment of the 
flowing universe appeared — Ap Re- 
talia was running parallel to the 
bogie, ten thousand tals away and 
wrapped in its monopole force 
shield. The bogie was a slender,

GALAXY 



tal-long white tube with a narrow 
funnel in front and an egg-shape in 
the rear. 

“A particle accelerator,” the 
underCaptain-Engineering barked. 
Urgath was near reproduction/death 
age, so old that her pelt was turning 
blonde. ‘‘Very simple, but not 
much thrust. Fission-powered, judg- 
ing from the thrust velocity.” 

Reta relaxed. ‘‘Archaic technol- 
ogy. No military threat then?” 

“Without our shield the stream of 
accelerated particles could damage 
us. Otherwise, no.” 

“What could it throw at us?” 

“Based on their demonstrated 
technology? You should ask an an- 
thropologist. Fission-bomb rockets, 
I suppose. Maybe fusion ones too. 
Laser beams. Microwaves. Nothing 
serious.” 

Reta paused for long moments. 
“Very well. Let’s move in and 
make contact.” 

All the underCaptains stared at 
him. He stared back. He knew what 
was bothering them — it bothered 
him too— but he had a vague feel- 
ing that contact should be made. 
That was why they made prescience 
a requirement at Captain’s academy. 

Skilled subtentacles bent to their 
tasks; the white ball that was Ap Re- 
tell ia moved toward the bogie, its 
sub-c engine generating momentum 
waves that eliminated the sensation 
of acceleration. 

“Scan for electromagnetic trans- 
missions,” Reta ordered the 
underCaptain-Communication. The 

CHANCE MEETING NEAR ARARAT 



unspoken corollary was that the 
First Circle telepath Would also lis- 
ten carefully for mental messages. 

“Close to ten tals and hold.” 

They could make out details of 
the bogie. The reactor and the crew 
area had to be in the egg at the ves- 
sel’s base — the tube was too thin to 
support them. The particle stream 
emitted a pale-blue glow. 

“I’m getting a transmission!” the 
underCaptain-Communication ex- 
claimed. “Coherent light, a fo- 
cused beam aimed at us. Can’t un- 
derstand it, of course, but it does 
sound like spoken language. Here, 
listen.” Sounds like starth barking 
emerged from a speakerdisk. “Had 
to modulate the sound frequency a 
bit; it was pitched too low for our 
earslits.” 

“Proabaly telling us to keep our 
distance.” Reta wiggled his tongue 
in pleasure — his eating orifice was 
cartilaginous and immobile. “Keep 
closing. We’ll show them who is in 
charge here.” 

Abruptly the screen flared white, 
then went to black. Moments later 
the stars and the bogie reappeared. 

“Hydrogen fusion explosion,” 
the underCaptain-Weaponry re- 
ported tersely. “The alien craft 
launched a small rocket at us. It det- 
onated in the shield. More com- 
ing.” 

The screen went through more 
antics, while the underCaptain- 
Weaponry watched his displays 
complacently. The ship trembled 
slightly. “Now they’re trying elec- 

9 



tromagnetics. We’re counter- 
phasing; no danger of penetration. 
Should we blast them?” 

“No.” Reta felt the decision tear 
at his sense of duty, but he some- 
how knew that this mystery had to 
be solved, not eliminated. “Let’s 
see what happens when the aliens 
realize they can’t touch us.” 

The bogie tried several other 
weapons, even swinging around to 
bring its drive stream to bear. But 
nothing could penetrate Ap Retalia. 

The underCaptains were mutter- 
ing among themselves. Finally Rho 
said, “Captain, we can’t waste any 
more time here. The Muster is 
scheduled for 087-1 1-1844.” 

“At emergency capability we can 
easily arrive in time. Compute a 
minimum-duration flight program.” 
Rho didn’t look happy, but she 
did as she was told. 

Finally the attack stopped and the 
laser message-beam resumed. Reta 
ordered the shield softened suffi- 
ciently to let the beam through, but 
kept it on a hair-trigger in case hos- 
tilities were recommenced. Then he 
flipped open his com. “Philology 
Section?” 

“Here, Captain.” 

“Tie into the alien transmission. 
Use all the computer capacity you 
need — you have priority. Communi- 
cation will send out a similar re- 
sponding beam to the aliens. If 
they’re this far from home they 
must be advanced enough to have a 
computer with a language- 
translating function.” 

10 



“I have the course plot,” Rho 
announced. “We can reach the 
Muster on schedule if we resume 
deceleration within a twentieth-day. 
Otherwise we’ll overshoot our Jump 
point.” 

“Good.” Reta felt the pressure 
of the underCaptainss worry and 
confusion building. Discipline held 
their tongues for the moment, but 
he would have to come up with a 
good explanation for his actions 
soon or face a Section Twelve vote 
by them — legal mutiny. 

“Captain, we’ve tied in our lan- 
guage computer, and the aliens are 
responding in kind.” That was the 
Philology Section chief reporting 
through the speakerdisk on the 
communication board. “Elementary 
comparatives in the spoken mode 
are underway.” 

“Is it making any sense?” Reta 
asked. The Poorg failure was sharp 
in his mind. Amorphous creatures 
from a frigid gaseous giant world, 
their language concepts had proved 
too complex for either language 
computers or philologists to de- 
cipher. Perhaps, he thought, if the 
two races had been able to com- 
municate with each other . 

“Yes, it is, Captain. Cognitive 
percentage, 81.5 so far, though 
that’s bound to go down somewhat 
as we tackle more complex words 
and grammar.” 

Reta’s tail tip twitched as he 
waited for the computer to finish 
learning the alien language. Even at 
electronic speed the task was a long 

GALAXY 



and complicated one. The process 
was simply an accelerated version 
of standard translation technique. 
Images and corresponding words 
were flashed back and forth. Some- 
times several different images were 
needed to nail down a subtle or 
abstract meaning, and some 
couldn’t be nailed down at all. But 
finally a glowing display indicated 
completion , 

“About time,” Reta hissed. 
“Since they chose to give us their 
language, it seems only right that 
we should break the shell.” He 
turned to the underCaptain- 
Communication. “Patch me into the 
computer channel . ’ ’ 

He thought very hard very fast. 
What was he going to say? First 
contact, even with such pitifully in- 
ferior creatures, was a grave re- 
sponsibility. 

“Go ahead, Captain.” 

Reta spoke in his own language, 
confident that the computer would 
translate his words and relay them 
to the bogie. “Attention, alien ship. 
Please acknowledge.” 

Silence. 

Reta leaned out of his chair 
mike’s range. “Am I getting 
through?” he asked the 
underCaptain-Communication. The 
latter nodded. 

“You’ve tested our defenses,” 
Reta resumed. “You know our 
technology is superior to yours. We 
can catch you if you try to run. If 
you don’t answer, we’ll blow you 
out of space and get on with our 

CHANCE MEETING NEAR ARARAT 



own business.” 

“Very well. I am answering. 
What must I do to prevent our de- 
struction?’ ’ 

The voice had a flat computer 
vocoder flavor, of course. The un- 
de iCaptains listened, interested de- 
spite themselves. 

Reta’s tongue flicked. “First of 
all, identify yourself.” 

“I am named Japheth.” 

“Where is your home world?” 

“I cannot tell you that. It is 
security-classified information.” 

The underCaptains hissed with 
amusement. Calculating the location 
of the alien’s launch point would be 
a simple thing for the computer, 
working back along its course until 
a solar system intersected. 

Reta moved to the point of his 
main curiosity. “You’re from the 
Rim, and a younger civilization 
than ours, as shown by your prehis- 
toric ship. What is the purpose of 
your flight?” 

“That too is security-classified.” 

“Why?” 

“To prevent that purpose from 
being jeopardized.” 

“It’s a hostile mission then?” 
Reta pressed sharply. 

“No. It has nothing to do with 
your race, or any race other than 
our own.” 

“If you don’t explain, my own 
security problem will force me to 
destroy you.” 

“I realize that. I will do anything 
I can to prevent my destruction, but 
I can’t reveal my mission.” 

11 



“Why not?” 

“I have instructions from those 
who gave me my task. I can’t de- 
viate from them. I am sorry. But I 
assure you again, I and my mission 
are no threat to you or your race. 
Can’t you simply accept that, and 
resume your own errand?” 

“Stand by,” Reta hissed angrily, 
then flipped off his mike. 

“Defecating waste of time,” Ur- 
gath muttered. “That alien must be 
some kind of fanatic; it’d rather die 
than talk.” 

“Indeed — and that doesn’t make 
sense.” Reta was whispering half to 
himself. “A pre-starflight technol- 
ogy nonetheless launches a starship. 
Why? Exploration? Curiosity? No, 
that ship had to have been a tre- 
mendous effort to construct. Its 
mission must be a vital one.” 

“All the more reason to blast it,” 
Rho said, “and eliminate a potential 
threat.” 

“You’re letting your xenophobia 
do your thinking for you. This alien 
has a vital mission, yet it’s willing 
to throw everything away rather 
than answer two questions, one of 
which it must know we can deduce 
ourselves. That goes beyond fanati- 
cism. Unless their brand of rational- 
ity is radically different from ours, 
it smacks of a totally inflexible 
obedience to orders. That’s a 
contra-survival trait, one you would 
more expect to find in — ” His tail 
slapped its rest abruptly. He flipped 
open the com. “Philology Section, 
study the sound qualities of the 

12 



alien transmissions.” 

“Yes, sir. But what are we look- 
ing for?” 

“If it’s there, you’ll know soon 
enough.” 

Reta leaned back, awash in the 
tension of command. What was he 
doing here? Why was it so impor- 
tant, compared to the Last Muster 
of his race? 

There were, of course, the 
dreams. Were they prescient visions 
sent to guide him, or false phan- 
toms driving him to nihilistic de- 
spair? 

“Captain!” The voice from 
Philology Section rippled with ex- 
citement. “We found it!” 

Reta’s tail tip untensed. It was 
only a minor part of the mystery 
solved, but a beginning was a be- 
ginning. “Report.” 

“The voice is artificially gener- 
ated, like our computer’s pseudo- 
voice. Either they have some reason 
for speaking through a vocoder, 
or — ” 

“Or we’re talking to someone 
who has to obey orders, no matter 
what. A computer.” 

Urgath hissed her anger. 
“Genitalia! I should have guessed 
from the visuals alone! At that 
crawling pace any crew would need 
a mountain of life-support equip- 
ment. There just isn’t room for it, 
not when you consider the size of 
primitive accelerator gear and fis- 
sion reactors. A cybernetic pilot 
would be much less bulky.” 

“Let’s see if we can find a way 

GALAXY 



around its security programming,” 
Reta said, then flipped his mike 
back on. “Attention, alien.” 

“Yes.” 

“We know what you are — a 
computer. Do you deny it?’ ’ 

“No. That isn’t classified infor- 
mation.” 

“Are there any members of the 
race that built you aboard?” 

“No.” 

“Not even in cold sleep?” 

“No.” 

“Then you’re in command of 
your ship. I’m in command of this 
ship. Between us we must find a 
solution. I must learn your mission, 
or else I have only one alternative.” 
“I fervently wish I could reveal 
it, but I can’t. I have been about 
my task for hundreds of years, and 
may be for thousands more. My 
builders wrought too well; I am 
lonely. And I am haunted by the 
fear of failure. I need help that your 
obviously space-wise race could 
supply.” 

“I see,” Reta said softly. 
“Please stand by.” He flipped off 
the mike and sat silently, thinking. 

“That machine is playing games 
with us,” Rho hissed. “Did you 
hear that talk about loneliness, like 
it was a person.” 

“I think it is like a person,” Reta 
mused. “How would you like to be 
the only one of your kind, on a 
flight taking hundreds of years, sen- 
tient and all alone?” 

Rho didn’t answer. 

Urgath rapped her tail against its 

CHANCE MEETING NEAR ARARAT 



brace stridently. As the senior un- 
derCaptain, hers would be the duty 
of succeeding Reta, if necessary. 

“We’ll help the alien,’’ Reta 
whispered. 

“We will not!” Urgath hissed. 
“Captain, I’m forced to demand a 
Section Twelve vote. You’re not 
well.” 

Reta blinked. His eyelids dialated 
open slowly. A remembered vision 
crossed his mind; emptiness, aching 
loss, a part of his haunted dreams. 
Then he forced himself to deal with 
the suddenly trivial matter before 
him. 

He probed the eyes of the tense, 
staring underCaptains. They were 
wavering. He had to bring them 
back. He knew that he would suc- 
ceed. 

“I’m not sick. We’ll leave before 
the deadline, and we won’t miss the 
Muster. I promise.” 

“But why this sudden fetish of 
helping strangers?” Rho demanded. 

Reta’s head hurt. He blinked 
rapidly, and said, “I . know we 
have to help this alien.” 

“What?” Worry edged Rho’s 
words. 

“We have to help Japheth.” 

“Why?” Urgath chimed in. 

“Just . feelings. Dreams. You 
see ...” He couldn’t go on. It 
wasn’t fair to them, to curse them 
so soon with his knowledge. 

“What do we see?” Rho insisted 
softly. “You have to tell us, or 
else ...” 

There it was. He had no choice, 

13 



unless he wanted to ignore the most 
recent dreams, shrug them off. And 
he couldn’t do that; they held him 
in thrall. 

“I’ve . seen blackness . 
nothingness . where our fu- 
ture should be.” 

Silence folded around the under- 
Captains. They knew, loved and 
feared the prescience that marked 
their high officers. Often it served 
as savior, or provided solace. Then 
too, it sometimes foretold doom, 
but even that was a bleak service. 
Above all, it was a mystery, re- 
spected and venerated almost by ra- 
cial instinct. 

“There isn’t any future . for 
us ... or the Poorgs.” Reta’s hiss 
whistled with terror. His eyes were 
red-rimmed, and he appeared gener- 
ally haggard. The burden was 
shared; he could let his facade fall. 

The underCaptains were shaken; 
the crimson ‘look ahead’ eyes of 
prescient- seen horrors couldn’t be 
faked. Finally Rho said, “Then the 
Last Muster is going to be . just 
that.” 

Reta darted his tongue in agree- 
ment. “Seollarta. The final battle of 
the primal gods, when all die, and 
the world is reborn.” 

“Don’t spout religion at us,” 
Urgath hissed. “If our whole race is 
pre-doomed, all the more reason for 
us to hurry and do our part to take 
those fecal Poorgs with us!” 

But Reta seemed not to hear her. 
“Rebirth,” he whispered, half in a 
trance. 



“Do others see it too?’’ Rho 
asked despairingly. “The High 
Command? Other Captains?” 

“Yes. The fleet will be told at 
the Muster. The people won’t be 
told at all. It would only cause 
panic. But . But there can’t be 
any rebirth for us. We have no fu- 
ture.” 

No one disputed him. Prescience 
had bred pragmatism into the race. 

“How does the alien ship figure 
into this?” Urgath demanded. 

“I’m not sure. But I 
think . My dreams have 
been . very strange. Can I trust 
them for guidance? I ... I must.” 
“What do the dreams say?” 

Reta stared at the star field and 
the alien probe in the screen. 
“There are other worlds, other 
races. What if . What if there 
are other gods too?” 

“I don’t understand.” 

“Don’t you see the irony? Two 
intelligent races are about to extin- 
guish each other. A combined total 
of over sixty thousand years of ef- 
fort and progress will become mean- 
ingless in the end. It’ll be as though 
neither we nor the Poorgs ever ex- 
isted. Except . except for this 
minor incident.” He turned to face 
the underCaptains, and his look was 
fey. “I’m . told to help them! 
Don’t you see! The only surviving 
effect of our whole race, our only 
reason for being, is to help that 
ship out there! How can I help get- 
ting religious — only a god could be 
so cruel!”

Silence reigned even longer this 
time. All thought of Section Twelve 
had vanished; Reta was mastered by 
his prescience, and as such was in- 
violate, almost holy. Finally Urgath 
said gruffly, “Let’s do whatever it 
is we have to do quickly, so we can 
join the Muster.” 

Reta’s tongue flicked, then he 
opened the inter-ship channel again. 
“We’ll help you, if it can be done 
quickly.” 

“I thank you.” 

“What kind of help do you 
need?” 

“I’m searching for a planet fit- 
ting certain requirement parameters. 
It must possess no intelligent life 
forms. Its surface gravity must be 
approximately nine point — ” 

“Hold on,” Reta interrupted. 
“I’ll switch you to Astronomy Sec- 
tion. They’ve indexed most of the 
solar systems within five hundred 
light years. I assume you want the 
coordinates of the nearest suitable 
world?” 

“Yes. Thank you.” 

Reta transferred the circuit, and 
gave the Section head detailed or- 



ders. Then he leaned back and 
stared at the starbow. 

“Why?” 

That was Rho. Reta turned and 
asked, “Why what?” 

“Why is the computer searching 
for a specific kind of planet? Re- 
sources? Colonies?” 

Reta hissed his disagreement. 
“Resources it could easily find 
closer to him. And with their primi- 
tive technology, that race couldn’t 
possibly support interstellar col- 
onies.” 

“Then what?” 

“An evacuation, I think. Suppose 
their home world is dying slowly 
for some reason. They could con- 
ceivably be searching for a new 
world on which to save a part of 
their race. A rebirth.” His voice 
fell. “Three races, but only they 
have hope.” 

“Not much hope,” Urgath hissed. 
“Even with a planet, they’ll 
never be able to reach it in junk like 
that. And they’ll probably be dead 
before the probe can return.” 

Reta didn’t reply. Silence en- 
dured until the com blared forth the

Astronomy Section head’s voice. 
“All done, Captain. I found the 
alien a nice young planet not many 
lights Core-ward from here — almost 
on its line of flight.” 

“Good work.” Reta switched 
back to the inter-ship channel. 
“You have your information. We 
must be on our way now.” 

“Again 1 thank you,” the com- 
puter voice said. “For my own 
part, I would like to go with you, 
learn about you, perhaps become 
your friend. But I too have an er- 
rand, a most urgent one.” 

“Gaining our friendship would be 
a waste of your time. We have very 
little of either commodity left. 
Goodbye.” 

Abruptly a curtain was drawn in 
Reta’s mind, and he turned to the 
job of resuming the flight. A new 
course program was calculated and 
laid in. 

Then he touched a heat-switch on 
the board in front of him, and felt 
the tingling induced by the 
momentum-drive. The colors of the 
starbow began to shift subtly. The 
alien probe vanished instantly. 

Yet it did not vanish fully from 
his mind, but gnawed constantly at 
the edges of his consciousness until 
short days later, when in the white 
heat of subatomic energy release, it 
vanished with all else. At the end, 
released from all duties, he won- 
dered if the alien mission would 
succeed, if any good would come of 
their chance meeting. 

And wondering, died.

★ ★ ★ 

From space the world was a 
blue-green globe dappled with 
cloud-whiteness. It had no name — 
yet. It circled a G2V star with a 
semimajor axis of 149. 5x1 0 6 km. Its 
mass was 5.97x10 27 gm, with an 
equatorial radius of 6378 km. It 
had one moon. The probe learned 
this and much else as it orbited the 
world, and its instruments scanned 
long and meticulously. 

Finally it decided that the world 
fit into its programmed parameters. 
It cut loose the accelerator drive 
system and descended on its fuset. 
It began traversing the southern 
temperate zone, landing in large 
river valleys. At each site remote 
surveyors rode out on their air 
cushions to probe the entire vicin- 
ity, conducting geologic and topo- 
graphical analyses. 

The sixth site proved to have suf- 
ficient potable river water, land 
for farming, and nearby ore de- 
posits of civilization’ s building 
blocks. The myriad other factors all 
checked out too, so the probe set to 
work. 

It scoured every part of the valley 
from the air with high-intensity mi- 
crowaves, sterilizing the soil to a 
depth of twelve meters. Then it 
sterilized a kilometer-wide perimeter 
circle around the selected zone, a 
protection against infection by na- 
tive life forms. The primitive native 
plants and animals of this world 
couldn’t compete with the tough 
products of Earthly natural selec- 

GALAXY 



tion anyway, but the program was 
nothing if not cautious. 

Amid the probe' s supply stores 
were the ingredients for building 
soil out of raw rock, but happily 
that wasn't necessary. The soil was 
suitable for growing Earthly plants 
after the surveyors sowed it with 
aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. 
The air and sunlight were, of 
course, also suitable. 

The probe had stored seeds and 
cells in its clone bank for every 
plant, animal and bacteria that had 
existed anywhere on Earth. It also 
had basic ecology programs — 
experts could add sophistications 
later. It set to work, using the sur- 
veyors, to sow, nurture and spread. 
First came the simplest plants and 
animals, then more and more com- 
plex ones, all in balanced harmony. 
The probe worked with tireless effi- 
ciency; it was in no hurry. 

So a long time passed before it 
finished, but finish it did. Thirty 
square kilometers of Earth reborn; 
trees, birds, bees, fish in the river, 
algae, deer, grassy meadows, flow- 
ers, insects, predators and 
thousands of other living things 
great and small. No one area of 
Earth had been recreated ecologi- 
cally; plants and animals from 
many had been selected for incor- 
poration in the program. 

Finally the ecology took solid 
root, growing and spreading of its 
own accord. Later the probe would 
establish other such enclaves, and 
eventually the entire planet would 

CHANCE MEETING NEAR ARARAT 



be remade. But for now one was 
sufficient. 

Tens of thousands of human be- 
ings were stored in the clone 
bank — all that could be gathered in 
the short last days — their memories 
preserved in the RNA storage unit. 
All would be ‘revived' eventually, 
but at first there would be only a 
small pioneer party, less than a 
thousand specially trained persons. 
They were grown in tanks of artifi- 
cial amniotic fluid to young man- 
and-womanhood, and the memory- 
RNA of their originals was inserted. 
Many had been older on Earth, but 
pioneer life required youthful 
strength. 

The women and men left the 
probe, and looked at their new home. 
It was night, but the moon lit the 
scene. They looked around them in 
awe, for not one had really ex- 
pected their desperate mission to 
succeed. Some looked at the stars, 
wondering which (if any) was Sol, 
knowing that its third world no 
longer bore intelligent life. 

None of them thought to thank the 
machine that had served them so 
well. 

They slept in sleeping bags under 
the sky, guarded from wandering 
predators by the probe’s weaponry. 
In the morning they would begin es- 
tablishing their niche in the new 
ecology. 

But before they slept, they took a 
solomn oath together; that this 
Earth would never go the way of its 
namesake. ★

The trouble with children, these 
days, is that they live in the 
future — and we parents are their 
past. 



The shuttle launching was not 
very dramatic. She wasn’t sure what 
she had expected, but surely more 
than this endless waiting, while dis- 
embodied mechanical voices crack- 
led around her in painstaking last 
minute checks as the vibrant 
summer stars were slowly bleached 
by the coming dawn. She had felt 
obscurely cheated, as though the 
least they could have done was 
given her a spectacle intense enough 
to be worthy of all this pain. 

The lift-off came finally, two 
hours after the final kisses for Su- 
san, Jay and Kevin. He had looked 
so unutterably, heartbreakingly 
small in his specially-built pressure 
suit that her resolve, despite weeks 
of careful buttressing, had crumbled 
and her lips were set grimly as she 
knelt down and crushed him to her. 
His new short haircut left bare the 
vulnerable little neck, baby plump 
still and smelling faintly of powder. 
A treacherous thought of Hecuba 
holding her grandson for the last 
time before his death had stabbed 
her, and she had stood up so hastily 
that the little boy had tumbled 
backward, laughing. 

THE EARTH DWELLERS 



“Final countdown.” 

“Standing by.” 

“Ten, nine ...” 

The stars had faded now but the 
moon was still visible, a thin spiky 
crescent, fragile-looking and yet 
obscurely comforting, because that 
was where they would go first and it 
was a place she could at least see. 
There, they weren’t entirely beyond 
her. Not yet. Not until tomorrow or 
the next day when the Oregon set 
out from Moon Base III on its silent 
journey that would reach half light- 
speed, carrying like some enchanted 
floating castle its 200 dreaming pas- 
sengers through their sixteen-year 
sleep until the spell should be bro- 
ken by the hard pioneer life await- 
ing them as members of the new 
colony on Sirius V, 

The thin golden flame of the 
shuttle’s rockets faded and they 
were gone. 

Duncan waved away the repor- 
ters, who had scented emotion and 
were beginning to circle. His craggy 
face was as calm as ever, the shake 
of his head as assured. Nonetheless, 
something in the blue eyes must 
have flashed ominously, for the re- 
porters backed off to hunt easier 
prey and left them huddled alone at 
the edge of the barren spacefield. 

“It’s always been like this, 
Rachel,” he said gently. “Always. 
You know that. Children grow up 
and go away. On ships or trains or 
covered wagons or spaceships or 
whatever; they go.” 

“But not so far!” 



19 



“It seemed as far, then.” 

“But parents could write to them! 
A letter might take a year — five 
years! — but it got there eventually. 
But now, across space ...” 

“Many never got there. Rachel, 
let it go. Accept it.” 

“I can’t!” she cried. “It’s easy 
for you! You just wall off your feel- 
ings and that’s that. I can’t do 
that!” 

He was too wise to take up the 
old argument. He put his arms 
around her, the dark head resting on 
his worn blue shirt, the shirt he 
liked because it was familiar and 
comfortable, like Earth. After a 
moment she said, subdued, “I’m 
sorry.” 

“I know.” 

“It’s just that we’ll never even 
know if they — if anything happens. 
And Kevin is so little. I’ve always 
wanted grandchildren and now I’ve 
only had him for two years. And 
Susan ...” 

“Shhh.” 

He held her while she cried, and 
around him the ugly utilitarian 
structures of Logan Spacefield blur- 
red, like children's sandcastles dis- 
solving in the rain.

They stayed three days more at 
the spaceport, watching by video 
the loading of passengers onto the 
Oregon, waiting for the final 
launching. Not that there was much 
to see. The colonists were placed in 

20 



suspended animation as soon as 
they reached the moon; the project’s 
medical team wanted to observe the 
suspended state as long as possible. 
Rachel visualized them, each in his 
clear plastic chamber, being hefted 
aboard like so many tons of seeds, 
or food, or landing fuel. She had 
seen pictures of the compact sus- 
pended animation chambers, and 
now the idea tortured her that Kevin 
would look as if he were in a see- 
through coffin. The suspension 
drugs would even slow down his 
circulation so that his ruddy cheeks 
would have the cool paleness of 
death . 

Stop it, she told herself severely. 
You know better than that. But the 
image kept returning. 

They sat on hard chairs in a large 
bare room set aside for close rela- 
tives of the colonists and watched 
the video screen for three days. 
They didn’t talk much. At noon one 
of them would leave their air- 
conditioned vigil, walk through the 
oppressive heat to the building 
which housed the spaceport 
cafeteria, and bring back soggy 
sandwiches and tepid coffee. The 
Earth-moon communications, many 
of them incomprehensibly technical, 
ceaselessly assaulted the air around 
them. When it was all over, the 
Oregon safely started on her epic 
voyage, both of them secretly felt re- 
lieved. It was over. They could go 
home.

GALAXY 



“The coffee’s ready,” 

“Be right in, Hon. I’m making a 
fire.” 

“Then I’ll bring it in there.” 

She got out her best silver tray, a 
wedding gift thirty-two years ago. 
She poured the coffee into wafer- 
thin china cups, dug around until 
she found the embroidered napkins 
Susan had made for her one long- 
ago Christmas, arranged them on 
the tray. 

It looked festive, a homecoming 
celebration. Abruptly she poured the 
coffee into thick brown mugs and 
shoved everything else, napkins and 
all, into the sink. 

Duncan was kneeling at the fire- 
place, his blue eyes warm in his 
fire-flushed face. “It’s good to be 
home.” 

“It’s a lot colder here than in 
Utah.” 

“Just tonight; Weather Central 
says it’s going to warm up again.” 

“That’s good.” 

They sipped their coffee in si- 
lence. The fire crackled, the flames 
randomly highlighting familiar ob- 
jects in the comfortable room. The 
books on the shelves opposite the 
fireplace brightened and then dark- 
ened, mocking human knowledge 
in transit. The ancient brass andi- 
rons shone steadily. 

“Oh, I meant to tell you, Maia 
videoed while you were in the 
shower. She said to tell you there’s 
a meeting of your alianthus commit- 
tee tomorrow at ten at the Center 
and they really need you there.” He 

THE EARTH DWELLERS 



grinned. “She looked very harried. 
Are you nearing a crisis?’ ’ 

“I don’t know. Not when I 
left.” Alianthus. Tree of Heaven. 
In the old after-life myth were there 
alianthi in heaven? Soon there 
wouldn’t be any anywhere if the 
government wouldn’t fund addi- 
tional research on Dodderson’s 
blight. She wasn’t usually a Joiner 
of Causes, but this one was differ- 
ent. The tiny park in the ugly, 
swarming city of her childhood had 
been graced with alianthi, and their 
long feathery leaves were tangled in 
all her girlhood memories. Even 
now she could feel the mild autumn 
sunlight sifting through the scarlet 
waving branches and dappling her 
bare arms. 

Were there alianthi on Sirius V? 
“Will you go to the meeting 
then?” 

“No. No, I don’t think so.” 

“I asked Jerry and Katia to come 
by tomorrow "night. You know how 
eager they always are to escape 
their labs and rusticate.” 

“Yes.” 

“They’ll want to know all about 
how it went, of course. They’ve al- 
ways thought so much of Susan.” 
“Yes, they have.” 

Another long silence. The fire 
hissed and cracked. 

“Rachel, you seem so . re- 
mote. Don’t shut me out.” 

“I’m not shutting you out.” 

“Yes, you are. Don’t you know 
it? Can you tell me what you’re 
thinking?” 



21 



“What do you think I’m think- 
ing?” she said in irritation. “I miss 
Susan.” 

“I know, although it isn’t as 
though we’re used to having her liv- 
ing in this house. But it seems to be 
something more. Can’t I help?” 
“There’s nothing else,” she 
snapped, feeling vaguely that she 
might be lying. 

He hesitated, concern becoming 
edged with exasperation. “Well, I 
don’t want to sound as if I’m trying 
to force you to talk to me, Rachel. 
But you know how it’s usually 
been — you feel better after you’ve 
talked things out and found a label 
for whatever it is you’re feeling.” 
“Mental Health Rule Number 
17,” she jeered. He stiffened and 
she regretted her words; what he 
had said, after all, was true. She 
knew that she should apologize but 
that he wouldn’t insist on it. She 
took advantage of his generosity by 
staying spitefully mute. However, 
after a moment she reached for his 
hand and held it. Limply. 

“Look,” he said, pointing to the 
window, “Look how bright the 
stars are tonight.” 

Even through the plastic they 
were spectacular. The last of the 
moon had melted away and the stars 
flung themselves across the sky un- 
rivaled. From where she sat she 
could see the Dipper, the North 
Star, the jaunty W of Cassiopeia. 
Not diamonds, she thought, they 
had more life than the cool hardness 
of diamonds, they pulsed and 

22 



throbbed and beckoned, more beauti- 
ful than jewels, more bewitching 
than anything on Earth . 

Abruptly she jumped up and 
jerked the blinds closed. 

Duncan stared down at his empty 
cup. “I’m going to bed. Coming?” 

He was looking at her compas- 
sionately, and suddenly she hated 
that. “No, not now. I’m not tired. 
You go without me.” He moved 
toward her but she retreated, putting 
the coffee table between them. 
“No, Duncan, don’t. Just let me 
be.” 

After a moment he nodded and 
left, his shoulders dropping 
helplessly. She was tempted to call 
him back but the something grow- 
ing in her wouldn’t let her and she 
watched with hard eyes as he reluc- 
tantly climbed the stairs. Then she 
sat on the sofa, not thinking, watch- 
ing clinically as the fire sputtered 
and sank. Little flames darted vain- 
ly at the ashy wood, finally set- 
tling for conserving themselves in 
subdued coals that gave off com- 
fortable heat but no soaring leaps of 
color. Like me, she thought bitterly, 
even as another part of her mind 
warned her not to be so melodramat- 
ic. She sat there a long time, fight- 
ing sleep, wanting obscurely to stay 
awake for her whole night of 
mourning, but her body clamored 
for its rights and finally, head 
thrown back and arms dangling at 
her sides, she slept. 

* * * 



GALAXY 



It was almost morning. Gingerly, 
pampering her stiff neck and aching 
back, she creaked to a standing pos- 
ition, grunting a little as she did so. 
Well, what do you expect when you 
sleep sitting up, she scolded. Your 
mouth is foul, go brush your teeth. 
No. 

Restless, she wandered from the 
living room to the study and turned 
on the night light. It glowed feebly, 
giving the room unaccustomed 
shadows and adding to the chill, 
impersonal look of early morning. 
On the the desk was an open book 
and she glanced at it idly: Weston' s 
Astronomical Compendium. It was 
open to “Sirius: planets of.” 

With an unexpected jab of intu- 
ition she knew that Duncan had sat 
here last night before making the 
fire, reading over yet once more the 
information which both of them 
knew by heart already, anesthesiz- 
ing the grief he wouldn’t admit to 
with injections of pure knowledge, 
trying to pave the light-years to 
Sirius V with statistics. 

That damn well figures; he al- 
ways did feel safer with facts than 
emotions! She knew she was sneer- 
ing unfairly but the thing growing 
inside her, the hard knot of some- 
thing she could not yet name, didn’t 
care. It drove her to pace fitfully, as 
she had paced during those long 
nights when she was carrying Susan 
and her unborn baby’s fierce kick- 
ing had banished sleep. 

Here was Susan’s telescope, the 
good one that they had bought her 

THE EARTH DWELLERS 



for her eighteenth birthday. There 
was no room for it on Susan’s great 
adventure and so it had been ship- 
ped home and left here. Like me, 
she thought again. 

She touched the telescope with 
one finger. The lens covers were 
carefully in place but the long gray 
tube and the adjustment knobs were 
powdery with dust. I’ll have to 
wash it tomorrow, she thought; 
something so beautiful shouldn’t 
be neglected. And Susan had loved 
it. 

Photographs hung above the tele- 
scope. Susan at six months, round 
and wide-eyed. Susan at three 
years. (“Sing, Mommy.” “All 
right, ‘Ma-ry had a little lamb, lit- 
tle — ” “No, no! My song!” 
“Twinkle, twinkle, lit-tle 
star . ”) Here was Susan, self- 
consciously stiff, at her college 
graduation. Bachelor of Science in 
Astronomical Physics. By the time 
she had her Ph.D. she had refused 
to pose anymore, but by then there 
had been Kevin . 

Hastily she moved on, touching 
the photographs, as she had the 
telescope, with one tentative finger; 
an archeologist trying to brush clear 
an inscription from the distant past 
without crumbling it. Here were 
herself and Duncan on their wed- 
ding day. And here was Susan on 
the beach the summer she was thir- 
teen, the summer they rented the 
public vacation unit at Lime 
Lake . 

“It’s so beautiful here, isn’t it, 

23 



Susan? Just look at that sunset!” 
They were walking along the 
beach, just the two of them, out on a 
mother-daughter stroll she had con- 
trived because she had begun to feel 
uneasy with this long-legged 
stranger who had replaced her 
plump, volatile little girl. Lately 
Susan was given to thoughtful si- 
lences, inexplicable frowns, and a 
slow withdrawal that made Rachel 
ache even as she recognized its 
rightness. 

“Look at that water! Don’t you 
wish you could paint those colors!” 
Susan obediently looked. “It’s 
pretty, I guess.” 

“You guess!” 

“What I mean is . yes, it’s 
pretty enough. But sunsets on water 
have been painted an awful lot, 
haven’t they? If I were going to paint 
something I’d want it to be some- 
thing different, something new- 
enough to be really exciting.” 

They had walked on in silence, 
the wet sand squishing under their 
bare toes. Suddenly Susan said 
animatedly, “Look, there’s the first 
star! You can just see it in the east 
there, above that headland.” She 
squinted at the pale silver sky. “It’s 
Altair, I think ...” 

There was a mirror hanging 
among the photographs, a small 
wood-framed square just large 
enough to show her face. Rachel 
peered at it reluctantly. Her hair, 
tangled from sleeping, hung lankly 
around her face, the black streaked 
with gray. Three deep furrows 

24 



across her forehead were the legacy 
from years of neglecting to wear her 
lenses. Her skin was still smooth on 
the surface but had begun to sag 
curiously downward just beneath it, 
like a pie cooling. Her eyes were 
bleary. 

Old, she decreed mercilessly, 
even while making a mental note to 
buy hair coloring. I’m old and I had 
better get used to it. When Susan 
reaches Sirius V she’ll still be thirty 
and I’ll be seventy-four, and even if 
they turned right around and came 
back I’d probably be dead by the 
time they got here. 

Abruptly she stooped down and 
began to pry the lens covers off the 
telescope. They clanked jarringly as 
she dropped them to the floor. 
Awkwardly she dragged the tele- 
scope across the room to the win- 
dow and yanked open the blinds. 

It was that cold hour between 
night and dawn, when the shadows 
have been drained from the world 
and color has not yet been put in by 
the rising sun. The grass, the rose 
bushes, the old maple tree, all 
looked monotonously gray, un- 
formed blobs without even the po- 
tential of becoming anything unex- 
pected. Rachel groaned softly and 
her fists clenched. Then light 
exploded in the room and she 
whirled wildly around to see Dun- 
can blinking in the doorway, be- 
mused in rumpled pajamas. 

“Rachel! It’s 4:30 in the morn- 
ing!” 

“Damn Susan!” she cried, the 

GALAXY 



words spewing venom. “Why 
should she go to the stars and leave 
us here on this damned Earth! It’s 
stale and insipid and . tame! 
There’s not an inch of it left we 
don’t know everything about, and I 
hate it!” 

She listened wide-eyed to the 
echoes of the futile, unsuspected 
jealously that called itself grief, and 
then she began to drown it in hope- 
less tears. 

★ ★ ★ 

Rachel and Katia strolled down 
the country road in the blue 
twilight, their talk as aimless as 
their direction. She had recounted to 
Katia the details of Susan’s leaving 
in a calm, detached voice that 
warned her friend to offer no sym- 
pathy. Katia picked daisies; they 
would look so pretty, she said, in 
her lab. She had just the vase for 
them, a very old silver and crystal 
one that had belonged to her great- 
great-grandmother. Rachel gave 
Katia the recipe for the fish chow- 
der. They discussed Katia’ s research 
project. 

Suddenly Katia said, “How is 
your committee going? The one to 
fund research on the alianthus 
blight?” 

“We met today. It looks as 
though with just a little more pres- 
sure the government might come 
through after all.” 

“That’s fine. Tell me,” she 
blurted. “Are there alianthi or 



something similar on Sirius V?” 

“I don’t know.” Rachel took one 
of Katia’s daisies and stared at it 
grimly. “But there will be on 
Earth.” 

They ambled on quietly. Behind 
them, sitting on the lawn in dilapi- 
dated canvas chairs, the men also 
fell silent. The night air was rich 
with the life of all the small secret 
things of summer: rhythmical scrap- 
ings of crickets, the mysterious dis- 
embodied cry of an unseen owl, a 
sudden flash of white as a rabbit 
hurtled across the lawn and dived 
into the safety of the hedge. The 
scent of late roses wafted through 
the warm, heavy air. 

“You were picked for early as- 
tronaut training, weren’t you, Dun- 
can?” Jerry asked suddenly. “Back 
when you were in the Service 
Corps? I had forgotten that until just 
now.” He paused. “Why’d you 
turn that down?” 

“Oh, I don’t know. It was so 
long ago. I guess I didn’t want that 
kind of rootless life.” 

“It’s funny, though. You turned 
it down, but then your daughter 
goes off to colonize a planet. It al- 
most makes it seem ...” he 
stopped, searching for the right 
word. 

Duncan knocked the ash from his 
pipe. The sparks fanned out, swirl- 
ing to the sweet-scented grass in 
graceful arcs, glowing like minia- 
ture stars in the velvety darkness. 

“I know what you mean,” he 
agreed quietly. “Inevitable.” ★ 



THE EARTH DWELLERS

It is indeed the case that many a 
slave has come to love his 
chains; they’re all he’s got! The 
same is true of— 

CAGES 






The ice- wind swept down from 
the northern mountains with sulphur 
in its teeth. Breath and voice of the 
great god Radnavar, it scoured the 
snow-smothered plains. To the 
north black clouds from Radnavar’ s 
volcano lair hid the glaciers; 
elsewhere the horizon made a hard 
white edge to the blue sky. A single 
leafless tree stood stiffly above the 
snow, its limbs twisted by the grip 
of the wind. 

Two men, streamers of condens- 
ing moisture unravelling from their 
mouths, stood resting by the tree. 
Their lips were dry and cracked, 
their blistered faces burned almost 
black between beard and snow- 
goggles. They wore hooded jackets 
and leggings of a bulky, glossy-blue 
fabric, patched at knee and elbow 
with greyish fur. Their packs were 
of the same blue material, but their 
snow-shoes were crudely fashioned 
from wood. At their sides leather 
holsters held dull steel pistols. 

John Forster, the leader, leaned 
on his ice-axe and peered back at 
the undulating way they had come. 
His companion, Morris Arnan, 
twisted a walking pole in his gloved 
hands and squinted around the hori- 
zon. Their home, the old, fallen 
starship was hidden in one of the 
valleys to the east; the hills they 
were heading for were heaps of 
white under Radnavar’ s smoke pall. 

“The god is angry, ’’Morris said, 
as his eyes turned towards the hid- 
den volcano. 

“Perhaps so,” said Forster. He 

CAGES 



gestured eastwards towards the site 
of the starship, “But that’s their 
worry, not ours. They ignore him. 
We can only wait and see.” 
Abruptly he faced west again. “Come 
on, we can’t stand here all day.” 

Morris swayed and almost stum- 
bled as he turned to follow, causing 
Forster to stop and face him. 

“Morris?” 

Morris nodded and kept moving. 

“Morris, are you fit to go on?” 

“I’m all right John.” 

Forster let irritation put an edge 
on his voice. “If you’re not going 
to be able to make it I want to 
know now.” 

Morris flexed his knee. A spasm 
twisted his face, then smiled. ‘.‘I’ll 
make it John. ’’Neither mentioned 
the half- healed wounds they both 
bore from the last, disastrous exped- 
ition to the beacon. Forster tested 
his own bruised shoulder and 
grinned mirthlessly. It was too 
soon. But they set off again. 

It was too soon.... The blizzard 
that left the snow they were cross- 
ing had been in full fury when he 
received his orders. He had been 
sitting beside Helena in the main 
hall, listening to the wind, when the 
messenger arrived. Radnavar was 
angry, and as he walked through the 
outer corridors Forster was sure he 
could sense the deeper thunder of 
the volcano. He could feel each of 
the distinct blunt toothmarks in his 
shoulder. 

“Sit down Commander.”' The 
Captain looked up from a glowing 

27 



oscilloscope, one of the few devices 
in the old control room that still 
worked. “How do you feel?’’ 
Forster remained standing; he 
linked his hands behind his back, 
ignoring the strain on his shoulder. 
“It’s my job to be fit.” 

The Captain eyed him sharply, 
his head thrust forward slightly so 
that his protruding white eyebrows 
gave him the appearance of a 
slightly bewildered and aggressive 
ape. “Always trying to seem 
superhuman.... This stupid competi- 
tiveness, Scouts versus Technos; 
why did we ever split up — ?” He 
rapped his fingertips on the desk in 
irritation. “Well, since you are 
human and you maintain you are 
fit, I have a job for you.’ 

“Yes?” Forster felt himself 
shrink close about a frozen image at 
the core of him. 

“Who is capable of leading an 
expedition among you?” 

“Sheller is still unconscious.” 
Forster spoke without inflection, his 
fists clenching and unclenching be- 
hind his back. “Barham’s leg was 
broken; Marwell and Pollis were 
both killed. ... I am the Senior 
now.” 

“That is what I thought. And the 
other two-thirds of your people are 
still on the foraging party, are they 
not? But I take it you could spare a 
small group for perhaps ten days?” 
“No more than three men. And it 
should be soon, before winter sets 
in. Your people still haven’t re- 
paired our tents, and we lost most 

28 



of our equipment last time....” He 
faintly sensed another eruption from 
Radnavar’s volcano; there would be 
ashes in the wind. “What are we to 
look for?” 

“For a spaceship. Commander, 
and as soon as possible.” The Cap- 
tain was measuring him with his 
pale eyes. ‘It may be the answer to 
our beacon; it appeared on the de- 
tectors three hours ago, made two 
orbits, then landed without making 
contact with us. It’s up to you to go 
and introduce us.” 

“Can’t you call it — the radio?” 
The Captain stared at him weari- 
ly. “Do you know how to repair it 
Commander?” The bitterness in his 
voice was unmistakable. “Besides, 
from its radio silence, the ship itself 
may need help.” He clenched his 
fists. “Whatever the ease, Com- 
mander, though it may be a chime- 
ra, an alien, a robot, a criminal; 
though it may cost still more of our 
lives getting to it. Commander, it is 
a chance we cannot afford to pass 
up. I’ll show you the co-ordinates 
as closely as I can get them, You 
must leave as soon as the blizzard 
lets you...” 

★ ★ ★ 

As he and Morris leaned against 
the ice-wind, Forster recalled how 
he had gone back to Helena, feeling 
as though he were made of parch- 
ment stretched over a core hacked 
out of ice: cold, hard, and brittle. 
The memory was uncofortable, and 

GALAXY 



he turned to Morris with a shout. 

“Come on! If you stop fighting 
here, you’re dead, Morris!” 

“I’m as tough as you are, John.” 

That’s what they don’t understand, 
thought Forster;, they think they’ve 
got it easy; their metal egg has 
lasted so long they think it’ll last 
forever. They ignore Radnavar; 
they forget we only fire the beacon 
if he lets us each year. 

It was always the same: Forster 
could walk through the outer cor- 
ridors of the ship and they wquld 
make way for him, would fall quiet 
as he passed, but would never meet 
his eyes. Nowadays the eyes them- 
selves were hidden behind fashion- 
able metallic lenses, and the blank 
stare of the little mirrors followed 
him through the ship. He could 
stand on a stairway and look down 
at them, listen to their laughter, 
watch them dance, all brilliant in 
the synthetic fabrics their usage 
would never wear out. They were 
warm and safe in their great steel 
egg, their cage, as long as their 
precious machines lasted. But they 
needed him if they were to eat 
meat. They laughed and shouted, 
they glittered at each other with 
those lenses, but they hardly ever 
looked beyond the ports; not even 
Helena. 

She had noticed the change in his 
mood as soon as he returned from 
the Captain; she stopped teasing 
him and retreated behind her lenses, 
leaving him face to face with his 
own reflection. The air smelt of

overspiced, synthetic food, was per- 
fumed to hide the staleness. She 
faced him in silence again when he 
told her. Coloured lights moved 
over her pale face and hair; Fors- 
ter’s ears sought under the music 
and found the blizzard. Then she 
said, ‘‘Why? It’s too soon. There 
should be somebody else, you’re 
not — ” 

“It’s my job,” he said. “I can 
do it. You’re not given anything 
here you don’t fight for.” His voice 
was harsher than he had intended 
and she was quiet again. 

“It’s too soon,” she repeated, 
turning her lenses to him. “Tliis 
whole place is going to fall apart. 
No one knows what’s happening 
any more. How many generations 
have we been down here? And all 
we’ve done is squabble and let ev- 
erything start to break down. You

if you can’t find meat, yet what 
happens?... I hate this world, what 
we’ve made of it. Why couldn’t 
they have landed us on a decent 
world? Where you can breathe the 
air without freezing.” 

“You can live out there,” said 
Forster. “You wouldn’t need your 
machines either. You just have to 
be prepared to fight for what you 
get. That’s they way this world is.” 
They faced each other in silence 
again, each listening to the blizzard.

The thunderous black pall was 
30 



coming south on the wind, darken- 
ing the snow. 

“Just look,” said Morris. “All 
that work firing up the beacon again 
and the clouds hide it.” 

“It’s not supposed to fire if the 
sky is covered, but it will. Now 
only Radnavar decides whether they 
call for help or not, just as he has 
to allow us to fire the thing in the 
first place. It’s his world and he 
gives us nothing we don’t earn.” 

“But he’s too late, isn’t he? The 
beacon’s already been answered.” 

“We don’t know that yet.” said 
Forster. 

A point of red light flickered in 
the turmoil over the glaciers and the 
clouds heaved; a geyser of black 
smoke began to climb through 
them. Seconds later the roar of the 
eruption came down the wind 

★ ★ ★ 

No man living had reached Rad- 
navar’s lair and returned. Forster 
had seen only the ramparts standing 
above the glacier: black, too steep 
to support snow, with mists curling 
about them and a menacing vibra- 
tion from the clouds beyond. 

Three generations earlier, one of 
the parties returning from the bea- 
con had tried to climb those cliffs; 
it was led by Axel Hordahn, who 
became the first and greatest of 
Radnavar’s servant’s. It was the 
first time men had tried to penetrate 
the mountains. Four days after they 
began climbing, a blizzard de- 

GALAXY 



scended and nothing was heard of 
them for two months. Finally Axel 
had returned alone, blind, his face 
both frost-bitten and burned by hot 
objects. When he was able to talk 
again, he had cried, “The power is 
there. I have seen it, and it took my 
sight. I have felt it. Burning,” 
There was awe in his voice, and 
joy- 

The others had never been found 
alive; but John Forster’s father had 
once shown him a place in the 
glacier, and John had knelt to peer 
into the ice. There was something 
pale and familiar hidden in its maz- 
ings. He stared, trying to make 
sense of what he saw, then sud- 
denly realized that there were faces 
in the glacier, but so distorted they 
seemed splintered out of the ice it- 
self, twisted into almost unrecog- 
nizable travesties of human expres- 
sions. He had stood up in shock, 
and those tortured faces had entered 
his mind and embedded themselves 
at the core of him; and afterwards 
he always heard in the ice-wind the 
screams of acceptance of the men 
Radnavar chose and took in the 
blizzard. 

“Ah, none of it will last,” said 
Forster. “The beacon was automatic 
whenever they built it, but now they 
need us to go and set it up every 
year, Soon it’ll stop working al- 
together, and their power-plant will 
fail, their fungus food won’t grow 
at all, and they’ll be out on the 
ice, face to face with Radnavar and 
none of their toys to protect them.

Then we’ll see who survives.” 

Morris squinted north at the vol- 
cano and then ahead at the hills 
they were making for. He was breath- 
ing heavily. They were approach- 
ing the crest of a low ridge with the 
wind cutting across them “It might 
be different now, mightn’t it John? 
If this ship is really from out 
there — ’ ’ 

Forster interrupted with an abrupt 
downward gesture, and both men 
crouched in hollows overlooking the 
valley, their pistols levelled. A 
hundred metres away a column of 
snow apes was making its way 
south. Forster watched them. They 
were half the size of a man, covered 
in long greyish fur, and had flat- 
tened faces, forward-looking eyes 
and strong teeth. They were mainly 
scavengers, omnivorous, but they 
hunted too. They could kill a man 
at twenty paces with a thrown 
stone. 

Forster held his pistol in both 
hands. The cloud from the volcano 
drifted over them and the scene 
darkened. The ice-demon twisted 
Forster’s face into the image of its 
own. He was reliving the last ex- 
pedition to the beacon, when the re- 
turning party had been attacked and 
trapped by a tribe of the apes. His 
shoulder throbbed again at the 
memory of teeth that still ground 
into it as he struggled to heave the 
bloody carcass from him and saw 
the others dying. He had done sav- 
age things with his gun and knife 
and had been one of four to escape: 

31 



the protected of Radnavar. 

He watched the apes over his gun 
barrel; they hunted mainly by sight 
so he felt fairly safe. One of them 
stood up awkardly on its hind legs 
and twisted about, sniffing the air. 
Forster turned his right wrist until 
the blade-sight covered the crea- 
ture’s chest. “Radnavar,” he mur- 
mured. “Do not forget me now.” 
The ape turned, peered about, then 
lowered itself to all fours and con- 
tinued south. Forster waited until 
the last of the column had vanished, 
then counted slowly to a hundred 
before he nodded to Morris and 
stood up. The cold had seeped into 
him and he was shivering slightly; 
his shoulder was too stiff to move. 
Both men stood for a moment with- 
out speaking, still remembering the 
last expedition. 

Forster turned away with a snarl. 
“We just needed five men and the 
automatics! — ” 

Morris nodded and said nothing; 
like Forster he was remembering the 
last big kill they had made, almost 
two years earlier. With twenty men 
they had trapped a tribe of apes in 
the foothills of Radnavar’s lair and 
the slaughter had lasted an hour. At 
the end, the volcano had erupted, 
turning the clouds crimson, and 
they had all shouted to Radnavar and 
toasted him in blood. 

They set off again in the chill 
grey light, trying to remember the 
times when slaughtering apes had 
been a monthly event, and cursing 
their weakness now.

Helena kept one of the snow apes 
in a cage; she had. shown it to Fors- 
ter the day before the Captain called 
him. 

“Isn’t he cute?” she said, tossing 
it a precious honey berry. “I’ve had 
him since he was tiny; I don’t think 
he’d leave now. I often leave the 
door open and he hardly ever comes 
out.” 

Forster flinched as she opened the 
cage, but the ape crouched at the 
back, eyeing them placidly. Helena 
coaxed. “Come on — ” 

“Helena — it could gut you with 
one hand.” 

“Oh, not Simon.” She turned to 
face him, her expression unreadable 
behind the metallic lenses: the ice- 
demon was looking out through 
Forster’s eyes and his face was fro- 
zen. Helena stepped away from the 
cage and said quietly, “I’m sorry, I 
wasn’t thinking at all. They’re wild 
animals out there; I shouldn’t have 
reminded you . I’m sorry.” 

He answered stiffly, “I was only 
worried about you getting too close 
to that thing. As you said. I’ve seen 
what they can do.” 

She nodded, her lenses turned to 
him. “It must have been horrible 
when you were attacked by them?” 
There was a hint of excitement in 
her voice.” 

“Just keep out of its reach.” 

Abruptly she laughed. “Anyone 
would think you’re jealous! Oh 
don’t be so stiff and — respectable. 
I’ll swear you nearly smiled half an 

GALAXY 



hour ago — come on, let’s go to the 
observation deck, I want to watch 
your beacon go off, then I’ll change 
the dressings on your shoulder...” 

When they had gone, the ape 
crept to the front of the cage, 
pushed open the unlocked door and 
climbed onto the laboratory floor. 
The doors were closed. From one 
came the hum of machinery, from 
the other the steady throb of music. 
The ape examined both, then climbed 
onto the bench by the circular win- 
dow. The sun had set and the east- 
ern sky was almost black, with the 
first stars showing. The ape stared 
out, turning its head from side to 
side — it stubbed its clawed fingers 
on the glass as it scratched at the 
stars. 

The beacon fired and white light 
burst against its face; then every- 
thing was black and the thunder 
began to roll in. The ape whim- 
pered. It leapt to the floor, then the 
sky went white again, and the ape 
fled to its cage. It crouched at the 
back, shivering, and hid its head as 
the blinding flashes filled the room. 

★ ★ ★ 

Sitting on the snow, Forster 
raised his head when the after- 
images of the last flash had faded, 
and eyed the hills where the beacon 
was mounted. He and Morrris were 
in the first valley of the foothills; to 
the north the volcano made a dull 
red glow near the horizon. They 
had eaten their dried meat cold 



rather than risk a fire that might 
bring the apes. The echoes of the 
beacon died and there was only the 
wind bringing the deep pulse of the 
volcano. 

“If our visitor’s anywhere near 
that thing,” said Morris, “he’ll be 
warm enough tonight.” 

“If we can trust their co- 
ordinates he’s not; but if he’s 
moved we’ll never find him in these 

hills If the weather closes in 

while we’re still looking, Radnavar 
will be taking two more to his 
kingdom.” 

“He won’t let you die, or he’d 
have no one to serve him at the bea- 
con.” 

It was true, Forster realized; he 
was now the only one experienced 
enough; he would have to lead the 
expeditions to the beacon in future 
years, would make the sacrifice and 
pour the libations of blood before 
starting the rituals that prepared the 
beacon to fire. When the power- 
plant finally died and the scaffold- 
ing fell, they would still make the 
pilgrimage and pour the libations... 

His father had been a servant of 
the beacon for the last half of his 
life. When he died, John had gone 
with them as they took his body to 
the magma-coated valley and placed 
it on the pyre under the main pro- 
jector. Wilhelm, his closest com- 
panion, had been there, but still he 
was alone; he’d felt torn and bleed- 
ing as though he should scream, but 
could show nothing. So he watched 
them prepare the beacon to fire ten 

33 



CAGES 



metres above his father’s body and 
followed them from the valley. 

From the next valley he had 
watched through dark goggles and 
saw the main beam stab upwards 
through the glare, like a great spear 
of ice carrying his father’s spirit to 
the icy stars. 

The beacon blazed again — a 
terrible cold burning, like the sun’s 
glare off the glacier. He had re- 
membered the frozen faces of Rad- 
navar’s chosen, immured in the ice, 
and felt their demon inside him, 
part of him. He pressed its coldness 
against the open wound inside him, 
and the wound became numb. He 
watched the beacon fire once more, 
felt the ice-demon hold him rigid, 
and whispered to it through blood- 
less lips, “Radnavar, I am yours 
now.” Then he followed the others 
from the valley. 

★ ★ ★ 

“What do you think we’re going 
to find over there?” Morris asked fi- 
nally when Forster did not speak. 
“If it’s what they’ve been hoping 
for, won’t it mean that everything 
will change here? — I mean maybe 
that ship’s brought proper 
weapons — fliers so we could hunt 
the apes — ” 

There was too much tension in 
his voice; Forster could hear him 
shivering, and he had been labour- 
ing to keep moving near the end of 
the day. Forster peered at him 
through the dark and said slowly, 
“We mustn’t expect too much, not 

34 



as long as we follow Radnavar. He 
won’t let things get soft for them or 
they’ll ignore him all the more.” 

“I suppose so, but he’s let us get 
this far, hasn’t he?” 

But Forster was brooding again 
and did not answer. 

They slept in the snow, trusting 
their reflexes to warn them of 
danger. The next morning Morris 
began moving stiffly, but he seemed 
able to keep up and Forster did not 
question him; if he wanted to hide 
an injury that was all right — as long 
as it didn’t slow them down. 

They crossed tracks in the snow: 
one of the rare cave bears migrating 
south. Normally it would have been 
worth hunting down for meat and 
hide, but now Forster dared not 
spend the time. With the weather 
closing in he wanted to be away 
from here as soon as possible: these 
slopes were the hills where men 
died. The wind was still harsh, 
smelling of smoke and sulphur; 
under it the loudest sounds were the 
creak and scrape of their snow- 
shoes. Forster found himself unac- 
countabley shivering, filled with 
sick tension. The hills where men 
died. 

Two groups had been trapped by 
blizzards and died of frosbite and 
starvation a day’s march north of 
here. And half a day to the south 
Paul Gurov had broken his ankle 
trying to rescue his partner from a 
crevasse, and had somehow re- 
turned to the starship for help. His 
partner had been rescued and died 

GALAXY 



of exposure on the way to the ship. 
Gurov had recovered but would 
never walk properly again, and he 
cursed his life for the bitter and use- 
less thing it was. 

They reached the first foothills 
and the climb became harder. Ver- 
tical slabs of black rock showed 
through the snow, the trail winding 
among them. Sometimes they were 
sheltered from the wind, but then it 
would beat against them in a sudden 
gust full of ice crystals. Morris was 
plodding on, his face set and deter- 
mined. Forster let him continue. 
From the top of the first slope they 
could see dark, castellated hills 
pushing against the grey sky. The 
wind was stronger and colder. It 
pushed and twisted at them, tearing 
long streamers of snow from the 
rocks and uttering the choking 
moans of the men it had taken. A 
scaly-feathered bird circled over 
them on great taloned wings, and 
zig-zagged against the wind back 
towards the hills. The hills where 
men died. 

Three years earlier Forster had 
been in a party trapped in one of 
the valleys ahead. Avalanche and 
blizzard had forced them to hack 
their way a step at a time up the 
face of the glacier. They had sur- 
vived by eating their dead. 

Morris stumbled, fell to his knees 
and was slow to get up. He avoided 
Forster’s eyes; Forster shouted to 
him, but the wind was too loud and 
his numb lips couldn’t frame the 
words properly. They went on. 

CAGES 



At mid afternoon it began to 
snow. Thin, icy flakes flecked with 
pumice swirled across them and 
clung to their clothes.- Forster tried 
not to imagine what would happen 
if the weather continued to worsen. 
The pall from the volcano and the 
snow clouds darkened the whole 
sky, the sullen red eruption offer- 
ing more light than the hidden sun. 
Under the wind the volcano’s roar 
rose to an insistent, brooding 
menace. 

They stopped in the shelter of a 
black rock. Morris siezed Forster’s 
arm and gasped, “Radnavar doesn’t 
want this. He won’t let us make 
it.” 

“We won’t know that till we try. 
Nothing’s easy on this world.” He 
didn’t care whether Morris heard or 
not.” We’ve got to keep moving 
now or we’ll be trapped here 
forever. Don’t think, don’t even 
hope. Just keep moving.” 

Many years earlier, with the 
snow slashing across him like this, 
he had learned that hope was for- 
bidden. Wilhelm, his partner, his 
closest friend from their first youth, 
had persuaded him to try and reach 
Radnavar’ s lair. The blizzard trap- 
ped them and after two days Forster 
realized that they had to turn back. 

He drove them both with an 
urgency that increased at each ob- 
stacle; they lost their packs and their 
ropes in an avalanche. Half-blinded 
by the cold they cut steps up ice 
cliffs, lost their way and had to re- 
turn. Forster’s will became a des-

peration to see the open snow-fields 
again and to return to the ship; he 
asserted all his strength to defy 
Radnavar’s powers. But he prayed 
that having turned back they would 
be allowed to return. 

Finally, they had seen sunlight 
flashing from the snow fields of the 
plains and he knew that his hope 
had been fulfilled. They began to 
make their way down from the 
glacier. Wilhelm stumbled through 
the snow, slipped, and a snow 
bridge parted under him, dropping 
him fifteen metres into a crevasse. 

They were at least two days from 
any help, and Forster no longer had 
the strength to cut his way down the 
ice walls and haul Wilhelm up 
again. Wilhelm was looking up at 
him calmly. “It’s my back, John,” 
he whispered. “I think — ” He tried 
to move, gasped and lay still again, 
shivering. “Yes,” he said, and 
gave a twisted smile. “It’s bro- 
ken.” 

Forster eyed the glistening green 
ice walls; he could not speak. 

“I’m not going to make it John. I 
can feel the cold inside me 
now . .” He paused. “I don’t 
want to freeze, John, or be found 
by the apes.” 

“No,” said Forster dully. “I un- 
derstand.” He never knew what 
else they said, but somehow he had 
drawn die pistol he had until then 
only fired in practice. His fingers 
were shaking. He drew a breath and 
steadied them. 

He never remembered hearing the 
36 



shot, but when he could think and 
talk again he reached for the ice- 
demon and prayed to Radnavar to 
forgive his arrogance, his hope of 
determining his own life and escap- 
ing the price. Then he accepted that 
Radnavar had chosen him, and he 
hid Wilhelm’s memory away. 

Behind him Morris was beginning 
to stumble; Forster could hear him 
gasping for breath, but he did not 
slow down. It was near evening and 
they were climbing a rocky slope 
covered with loose snow and slabs 
of ice. Beyond its crest the valley 
would shelter them from the worst 
of the weather. 

A blinding red slice of sun ap- 
peared between the clouds, then 
sank from sight, and the world dar- 
kened around the glow of the vol- 
cano. Somewhere ahead animals 
growled and chittered; the ice-eagle 
circled through the gloom and van- 
ished again. The darkness congealed 
in wind-blown ice that stuck to the 
eyelids and smeared across the 
eyes. 

To the north-west the beacon 
fired. The darkness shattered, then 
fell back with the first roll of thun- 
der. The wind brought the cries of 
animals, but Forster could see noth- 
ing through the snow and swarming 
after-images. He shut his eyes as 
the darkness flew apart again, and 
the glare came red through his 
eyelids. The echoes surged and 
crashed and were pierced by shrieks 
from ahead. The wind slapped at 
their brittle faces; ice scraped their 

GALAXY 



skin. Forster shouted to Morris to 
hurry and leaned into the wind, 
lengthening his stride. He could not 
hear the creak of their snowshoes. 

The fleeing animals were getting 
closer. Forster recognised the voices 
of apes; but it was a cave bear that 
materialised out of the storm ahead 
of them, swinging its head from 
side to side as it came lurching 
down the slope, grey on grey, then 
suddenly ink-black against the next 
flash. It gave a high, frightened 
growl and fled past them in the 
dark. Forster’s pistol was in his 
hand, tracking automatically as his 
eyes flickered over the swarming 
darkness. He stumbled over a rock, 
slipped on loose snow, forced him- 
self on. The reptilian snow-eagle 
slanted overhead, a paler grey in the 
sky, and swept away once more. A 
hundred metres to the right, some- 
thing huge and half-seen went strid- 
ing down the slope on two legs and 
split the fury with its shriek. 

And the shriek was answered by 
the howls of the ape tribe that burst 
over the crest of the ridge. Forster 
began to shoot. “Morris!” He 
shouted without turning. “Kill 
them!” 

He dropped the clumsy ice-axe 
and brought up his hunting knife in 
his left hand. He crouched, still 
shooting. “Morris!” The gun jerked 
and was empty. “ Morris /” Then 
two of them were in under the knife 
and he went down rolling and kick- 
ing, trying to hold teeth away from 
his throat while his other hand 



slashed and then heaved the knife 
in. 

He bellowed again and wrenched 
himself free, rising to his feet as 
hands tore at him. The beacon 
blazed and he was surrounded by 
subhuman, twisted bodies and gar- 
goyle faces stamped out of the 
diamond-hard glare. He made a 
wide swing with the knife and the 
apes receded into the dark. He had 
time to wonder at the cause of their 
fear, then the answer came. As the 
volcano erupted, the other sounds of 
the night were split open and shat- 
tered as a column of hard yellow 
light was blasted into the cloudbase. 
The ground heaved and the ghastly 
light showed the bodies of the apes 
as they fled past him. 

He ran to the top of the ridge to 
face the star-clusters of lava nuriea 
at the skies, and he shouted his 
hatred and joy into the splitting 
roar. “Radnavar! — Radnavar!” 

He turned on the shivering crest 
of the ridge and saw the apes van- 
ishing into the dark. He brandished 
his empty gun at them and drew a 
breath to bellow again, then he saw 
another, separate shape lying on the 
snow, twenty metres away, and mo- 
tionless.

“What was it like when they 
died?” Helena had asked him the 
night before he left, and he had 
been unable to answer. Now he 
bent over Morris’s body in the wav- 

37 



CAGES 



ering light, and the wind chilled 
him. He had fresh wounds where 
the apes had bitten through his 
clothing, but he could not feel 
them. Lava began to fall into the 
snow in a series of short, savage 
hisses; he ignored it. Morris was 
dead, but the wounds were all on 
his back, and blood was freezing on 
his chin; he had fallen before the 
apes reached him. 

“Radnavar,” whispered Forster, 
“you have taken him and spared 
me. I am yours.” Then he reloaded 
his pistol and began to drag stones 
together over Morris’s body. 

Morris, he thought, you fool, 
why didn’t you tell me? ... I 
should have made sure, I should 
have sent you back. You must have 
known you wouldn’t make it. You 
must have been haemorrhaging in- 
side, you must have known. 
The wind swirled past him carrying 
ice and ashes. 

The ice-wind moaned and beat 
against the hills, boomed among 
cliffs of ice and granite; it blew 
over Forster as he laboured to cover 
Morris’s body, drew the warmth 
from him, buffeted him with the fall- 
ing ash and snow, the ice-armoured 
rocks, then swirled away, unspent. 

What was it like when they died? 
And he could not answer, feeling 
the ice-demon gnashing under his 
skin. He lay looking at her in the 
half-light that left her eyes 
shadowed and mysterious. After a 
moment she had said, “You cried 
out in your sleep last night.” 

38 



He laughed nervously. “You 
were having nightmares Helena.” 
“You called their names, John. 
You were watching them die again, 
weren’t you?” 

The ice-mask snarled and 
screamed inside him; numbly he 
stroked her arm, not looking at her. 

She whispered, “God, it’s horri- 
ble what this place does to us. 
People kill themselves here; out of 
boredom. They say it’s something 
else, food poisoning, an accidental 
overdose, but it’s not. I know. And 
now you’ve got to go back out 
there — It’s too soon. You’re a 
bit of a machine at times, but I 
don’t want to lose you.” Her voice 
rose. “Oh God, there must be 
something else. I look at the stars 
sometimes and try to imagine the 
other worlds out there — there must 
be something better for us there 
somewhere, there has to be. .” 
Awkwardly he had kissed her 
forehead. “It’s all right,” he said, 
gently, desperately, in fear that his 
armour would break away and the 
frozen wounds reopen inside him. 
“Go to sleep. Go to sleep.” 

But later, with Helena sleeping 
beside him, he had watched the first 
grey light spread across the ceiling, 
and his face had twisted itself into 
the tortured shape of the ice- 
demon’s mask. Shudders running 
through him as though he were out- 
side in the wind, he had watched 
the faces dying again, twisted and 
screaming; he saw them all, through 
the years of his life, names he had 

GALAXY 



forgotten, men he would never 
know, going to join the ice-masks 
in the glacier. “Radnavar,” he 
gasped. “Radnavar. Help me. It has 
to be, there must be a reason — It’s 
unbearable otherwise! . Help me 
believe it. Help me.” 

The ice wind screamed steadily 
outside. 

★ * * 

Now he stumbled away from the 
cairn he had built, and down into 
the valley. The eruption had ceased 
and the wind was muffled, but his 
reserves had vanished. He found a 
hollow at the base of a low cliff and 
fell into it. The wind reached in 
after him and placed cold hands on 
his body. He shivered. The flesh 
was squeezed thin and brittle over 
his bones. His lips quivered; he 
clenched his teeth, then whispered 
in desperation and pleading, 
“Thank you Radnavar, you have 
spared me; you have brought me 
closer to you. I am beginning to 
see; I am more now than I was. I 
will see, I will understand, fully. I 
am yours, Radnavar, help me see.” 
Gradually the shivering stopped. 
His head fell forwards onto his 
arms. His eyes closed. “It must 
be,” he whispered into the wind. 
“It must be. It must be . ” He ac- 
cepted the cold's embrace and let it 
draw him into sleep. 

★ ★ ★ 



The spacecraft stuck out of the 
valley floor like a knife from a 
wound. Forster blinked at it through 
his swollen eyelids for several sec- 
onds, then began to shuffle down 
the slope. The ship was a hard 
silver cone, smooth and impersonal; 
it did not belong among the rubble, 
ice and drifting fog that surrounded 
it. His eyes were watering in the 
cold so that the craft wavered and 
blurred as though it might vanish 
like a bubble, but when he blinked 
his sight clear it remained. He 
moved stiffly closer. He was too 
tired to shiver, his fingers were 
numb and probably frost-bitten. His 
face was a dull burning ache. He no 
longer heard the wind, and the 
rumble of the volcano seemed to 
have receded into his blood. 

He stumbled on the heat-cracked 
rubble surrounding the ship. He 
stopped again and stood looking up 
at it, swaying slightly as he tried to 
formulate a question he was too 
exhausted to pull from his mind. As 
he was about to move forward, a 
doorway appeared like an eye open- 
ing sideways in the metal wall. A 
man stood looking down at him, 
carelessly holding a rifle with one 
hand at its balance point. Forster 
tried to focus on him, fumbling for 
words, but the man spoke first. 

“Hello there. I suppose you’re 
hungry now you’ve finally got 
here?’’ The man wms bony and 
stoop-shouldered, with thinning 
white hair. A cloud of condensed 
moisture drifted away from his 



CAGES

words. Forster tried twice before he 
could speak. 

“Yes — a little.” 

“Good.” Then man pushed a 
button, and a metal ladder de- 
scended towards Forster. “We still 
speak the same language; that’s al- 
ways a good sign. Come on, it’s 
cold up here too.” 

Forster hauled himself up the 
ladder and lurched through the 
doorway, avoiding the hand the 
man put out to help him. Im- 
mediately, the outer door slid shut, 
and the warm air folded around 
him. He felt torn between two 
worlds, with most of himself wait- 
ing in the cold outside. The man 
waved him towards an inner door. 

“Hmm. Not exactly a red carpet 
and massed choirs, are you; but I 
suppose I shouldn’t expect too 
much. You look as though you’ve 
had a rough time getting here. My 
name’s Fyadov, by the way.” 

Forster mumbled his name in 
reply as he followed Fyadov into a 
control room seemingly filled with 
flashing lights, a set of view-screens 
and a circular porthole showing the 
northern mountains. “You saw our 
beacon. ?” 

The man turned. “You could say 
that; I’ve been trying to fix some of 
the circuits in my transceivers ever 
since — my own fault as usual for 
not checking the overides. That’s 
one of the reasons I didn’t go look- 
ing for you, but this thing wasn’t 
built to go hopping over every little 
hill — sit down, by the way; you 

40 



can clear the stuff off that 
chair — and besides, I thought, any 
set-up that can pulse a synchrotron 
like that must be capable of coming 
and meeting me. And I was right 
wasn’t I? Though as I say, you’re 
not exactly the baccanalia I’d have 
liked. In fact I was starting to think 
about blasting off again. Your sig- 
nal’s getting weaker, you know.” 

“Yes,” said Forster numbly. “It 
dies out after a while and we have 
to restart it every summer. I don’t 
understand what we do. What 
did you call it, a . ?” 

“A pulsed synchrotron. At least 
that’s what I imagine it is — white 
noise from UV to microwaves. 
Abysmally inefficient of course, 
though I’m no physicist. You must 
have been down here for a few 
years if you’ve even forgotten the 
name of the thing. Must try to work 
out how long, later. These fusion- 
plant-and-raw-meat societies can be 
absolutely fascinating. No offence. 
Let’s see if we can find you some- 
thing to eat.” 

Forster was left sitting among the 
glittering eyes of the instrument 
panels, breathing air that smelt 
faintly of ozone and machine oil. 
The sky was darkening over the 
mountains. Half of him was still 
outside among the ice and the rasp- 
ing wind; he didn’t belong here, 
and there was the question he could 
feel but still not ask — 

Fyadov returned and cleared 
some microelectronic components 
from the table and put down two 

GALAXY 



plates of steaming green paste. 
“Sorry about the state of the place. 
I haven’t kept up with the house- 
work lately . perhaps I wasn’t 
really expecting visitors after all.” 
He noticed Forster still looking at 
the food and grinned. “It won’t kill 
you. I live on the stuff and look at 
me. Well, come to think of it, there 
are better adverts. Let me 
guess — your hydroponics aren’t 
working too well any more?” 

“Only the Technos eat this,” 
said Forster. “We eat meat.” 

“Oh. Dear, dear, one of those 
systems? You guard them, and they 
stand back when you pass and call 
you Lord or whatever. Hmm, that 
would be ... Well it’s all we’ve 
got so you’d better eat it.” 

He was silent while they ate, but 
then his eagerness to talk reasserted 
itself. “I sort of free-lance for the 
Local Systems Archaeological Sur- 
vey. Supposed to be part of a team 
but — you know. ... I’m not sup- 
posed to be here at all, but one of 
those god-forsaken devices they use 
to push this tin can about went 
wrong and I had to come down and 
replace a few parts. Your electronic 
bonfire blew my transmitters before 
I could tell anybody.” 

Forster stiffened. “No one knows 
you’re here?” 

“No — wouldn’t make much dif- 
ference. We’re always supposed to 
work in groups but I try not to. I’d 
rather study people. They 
couldn’t get here for months any- 
way. Besides I’ve almost fixed ev- 



erything now. It’s a stupid sys- 
tem really, but I’ve been in it too 
long to get out now.” 

“You’d get out if you could?” 
Forster asked, looking past him at 
the evening darkening over the 
mountains, and thinking of Rad- 
navar’s growing fury as they had 
approached the foothills, and the 
way he had taken Morris. 

Fyadov was still talking. “Oh I 
don’t know though. When you 
spend enough time on a thing, half 
a life say, it gets to be important to 
you whether it really is or not. .” 
He lowered his eyes a moment. 

Forster remembered the rocks he 
had piled over Morris’s body. “If 
you’ve made enough sacrifices for 
it. .” Fyadov’s voice had be- 
come quieter and harsher. “People 
are frightening things. I can’t stay 
away from them; I just study them, 
watch them. .” 

Forster thought of metallic lenses 
returning his own reflection. Fyadov 
murmured sadly. “Most of us make 
our own prisons that way. There’s 
no security like the security of the 
cage.” 

Forster found his fists were 
clenched, “You can still tell them 
we’re here?” 

“Oh yes — it’s only a couple of 
hours’ work, even for me. .what 
are we going to do with you people, 
though? I’d guess you’re all finding 
it a bit rough here. You might be 
better off somewhere else. They’ll 
probably be able to divert a spare 
freighter to pick you up. ’ ’

Forster nodded slowly; he thought 
of the Teehnos, the drones who 
would no more step outside the ship 
than Helena’s ape would leave its 
cage. But offer them a new world, 
soft and luxurious, with no need to 
fight. “Yes,” he said savagely. 
“They’d go. All of them.” He mut- 
tered, “She’d be one of the first.” 

Fyadov met his eyes and nodded. 
“People are wild animals.” he said 
bitterly. “Their claws are in their 
minds. We all live in cages or we’d 
tear each other to bits. We rattle the 
bars sometimes but we know we’d 
never dare get out. .and it drives 
us all mad in the end.” 

Abruptly he turned to the control 
panel. “My cage is bigger than 
most, though.” He pressed a but- 
ton. “Look.” One of the screens 
lit, and showed the sky with a few 
gaps in the cloud, and stars. 
“There — those stars are jewels on 
the walls of my cage. Look at 
them, the spaces between them.” 

The clouds opened and the screen 
filled with stars — icy, glittering 
stars in shoals and clusters and 
misty nebulae, throbbing and 
trembling like life itself. Forster 
watched with sweat on his face. He 
thought of the beacon, of Helena 
casually tossing a honey berry to 
her ape. “Look at the spaces be- 
tween them,” said Fyadov. 
“Look.” 

The stars swayed apart, fell over 
the edge of the screen, and more 
crowded into its centre. Forster 
clenched his teeth, unable to look 

42 



away. He had been spared and Mor- 
ris taken. Why? 

Fyadov was saying, “And each 
of them represents half a dozen pos- 
sible worlds. All different. You 
seem to live forever, moving at 
those speeds, so I’ve seen many of 
them. They’re all different. I could 
show you pictures — but it wouldn’t 
help, you’d have to go there. Then 
you have to forget all you were be- 
fore; that’s why we need cages, to 
keep something of ourselves from 
the beasts, the other beasts. 
You’ll have to leave everything 
here — this trekking about in the 
snow, hunting, being called Lord, 
getting frostbite — there’s no place 
for it.” 

The stars were still swarming 
across the screen, faster now, so 
that larger clusters could be seen, 
rotating, sliding against each other 
and breaking away as they hurtled 
out of sight. “You’ll all be out on 
the ice, chipping stone axes and 
hunting with bone knives within a 
hundred years if you stay. The 
real cage is the bones of the skull of 
course.” 

The stars were an avalanche, a 
whole universe of stellar ice falling 
to fragments and plunging 
away. There' s no place for it. 
Forster’s hands were shivering. He 
had been spared — because, 
because — He reached towards the 
screen as though to stop the stars. 

The room went white at the first 
flash of the beacon, then was full of 
dimness. Forster stiffened in his 



GALAXY 



chair. He understood. He stood up 
as the. thunder gathered. 

“. the bones of our skulls 
. so finally there is only one 
escape.” 

Forster levelled his pistol at the 
man’s chest. He fired with the next 
flash, and afterwards did not re- 
member hearing the report. Fyadov 
slumped forward onto the table. His 
eyes twisted sideways to meet Fors- 
ter’s. He tried to nod, then muttered 
thickly, ‘‘The only escape, the only 
escape now. For you too.” Then 
his eyes closed. 

The echoes of the beacon began 
to die and the next flash lit the 
room. Forster lowered the gun 



slowly and pushed it back into his 
holster. His hands were quite 
steady. He stood still for a moment, 
then turned towards the airlock. 

When he opened the door he 
paused at the top of the ladder. The 
wind howled faintly. The cold air 
fitted his face like a mask of ice. 
He bit into it and whispered 
harshly, ‘‘Radnavar, I am still 
yours.” 

The beacon had stopped flashing 
by the time he reached the crest of 
the first hill. The ice- wind was tear- 
ing holes in the cloud layer, and he 
could see the stars; they glittered, 
cold and far off, as though seen 
through the bars of a cage. ★

THAT BUCK ROGERS STUFF 



The young lady was very seri- 
ous and although I might have 
wished that she were an ogre, with 
raucous voice, and nose meeting 
chin in front of her lips, she was ac- 
tually very professional in appear- 
ance; highly attractive, and — 
according to most objective 
standards — intelligent. 

My wife and I had come to a typ- 
ical Los Angeles show-business 
party. The young lady had been 
waiting for me. Before I could get 
properly into the room she had ad- 
vanced menacingly. 

“You write science fiction,” she 
accused. “Escapism. What good 
does it do to get people dreaming 
about that Buck Rogers stuff?” (I 
swear it, she used that very phrase, 
the same one that countless teachers 



used in the days of my youth when 
they caught me reading Astounding 
Science Fiction.) 

Naturally, she had A Cause. 
“We spent billions for what? For 
some pieces of rock and pretty pic- 
tures on television! And there are 
millions out of jobs, we need better 
schools, and — ’’ Galaxy readers 
have probably had similar experi- 
ences and can finish off the speech 
for themselves. It's not the only 
time I’ve been put to The Question: 
“Why throw money away on space 
when there’s so much that needs 
doing here on Earth?” All right, 
let’s talk about space and see just 
how far we can get.

GALAXY 



First, though, a couple of com- 
mercials. For a really beautiful job 
of discussing what we’ve already 
got out of space, send a request to 
NASA, Washington DC 20546 for a 
copy of “SPINOFF 1976.’’ My 
copy has no price on it; I got it as a 
gift from the National Space Insti- 
tute (1911 Fort Myer Drive, Suite 
408, Arlington Virginia 22209, 
dues $15 annually, $9 for students, 
and if you haven’t joined yet, DO 
IT!) I expect NASA has some nom- 
inal charge for SPINOFF 1976, but 
you could probably get one free 
through your Congresscritter. 

SPINOFF was written by Neil 
Ruzic of NSI. He’s also the author 
of an excellent book called Where 
The Winds Sleep, something else I 
recommend. Between SPINOFF and 
Ruzic’ s book you can find plenty 
answers to the silly question about 
why spend money on space. 

In fact, the problem is knowing 
where to begin. Weather predic- 
tions? Remember when the 
weather-man was a joke? True, the 
Weather Bureau makes some mis- 
takes even yet; but not very many, 
and almost never when it comes to 
hurricanes. You can show that the 
space program has pretty well paid 
for itself in better weather forecast- 
ing alone. 

Those concerned about pollution 
will be pleased to hear that Earth- 
watch satellites finally give us a 
chance to see the real effects of pol- 
lution. Mining prospecting has been 
revolutionized by satellite photo- 



graphy. The international Food and 
Agricultural Organization in Rome 
can, from satellite data, get a good 
forecast of famine areas and global 
food production. 

That’s all satellite stuff. Industry 
benefits are nearly incalculable, and 
I don’t mean frivolities like Teflon 
frying pans. Stuff like test proce- 
dures and quality control: the in- 
spection methods developed for 
man-rating spacecraft and boosters 
are now routinely used in building 
better plows, tractors, automobiles, 
skis, hiking boots and packframes, 
electronic equipment, and darned 
near anything else you can think of. 

In my early days in the space 
program one of the hardest jobs we 
had was monitoring physiological 
conditions in a stress environment. 
Just getting an ordinary electro- 
cardiograph (EKG) through a pres- 
sure wall required great ingenuity. 
We invented a number of such de- 
vices; we had to. My own inven- 
tions are long since obsolete — but 
the space medicine technology that 
grew out of our early efforts is now 
routinely used in hospitals and 
clinics all over the world. Mass 
spectrometers to analyze exhaled 
breath; microminiature EKG sys- 
tems worn by hospital patients and 
displaying abnormalities to the duty 
nurse; blood analysis equipment; 
even heart condition diagnosis from 
moving vehicles; all routine, and all 
developed as part of the NASA 
package. 

Your tires last longer, you can 

45 



buy large fiberglass structures, 
firemen can keep your house from 
burning, your electrical system is 
simpler, crash helmets work better 
(remind me sometime to tell you 
about the purchase-order for “nine 
freshly-killed human male corpses, 
ages 21 to 40 at time of death, must 
not have any abnormalities of brain 
or upper spine; expendable research 
item; no salvage value.” The Pur- 
chasing Officer’s reaction to that 
was, uh, interesting); driver-training 
simulators work better, paint lasts 
longer, and golf clubs do a better 
job of driving the ball. 

“Whoa. That’s all technology, 
and technology is evil. It causes 
pollution, and kills people in wars, 
and—” 

At that point my usual reaction is 
a loud “Aaargh!” and a burning 
desire to find a drink. Quickly. Es- 
pecially when it was said by a 
young person wearing a thin electric 
wristwatch and polyester imitations 
of honest blue denim, driving a 
Mercedes, and feeling committed 
because they haven’t eaten table 
grapes for weeks, I should control 
that reaction, of course; but if I 
were able to do that I’d probably 
still be in aerospace management 
instead of living the unnatural life 
of a writer. 

Still, such people ought to be an- 
swered. Our whole future may de- 
pend on it. Let’s try.

California’s Governor, Jerry 
Brown, has built himself quite a 
reputation by pushing “Alternate 
Technology” and the philosophy 
that goes with it. “Make do. Expect 
less. Conserve. Smaller is better. 
Recycle, Be satisfied with what you 
have. There’s only one Earth.” 

Now there are some attractive 
points about all that. Moreover, the 
vision of a stable, low-to-zero- 
growth economy, concentrating on 
adventures of the mind, with a lot 
of ‘‘cottage industry” can be a 
noble one. It’s probably possible, 
too — for us, and for a while. 

It is not a philosophy likely to 
appeal to the poor of this world. 
Like it or not, a conservation 
oriented low-growth world economy 
dooms most of the world’s people 
to wretched poverty. But what has 
that to do with usl Can we not, 
ourselves, change our ways and let 
others go theirs? 

Probably not. Like it or not, 
we’ve got most of the 
technology — and we don’t have 
enough to develop the Earth to a 
point of satiation. If all the world 
gets rich through the same wasteful 
processes we employed, we’re 
probably in big trouble. Worse, 
what of our grandchildren? The 
Earth’s resources will not last 
forever; and what then? 

I’ve argued here before that this 
generation is crucial: we have the 
resources to get mankind off this 
planet. If we don’t do it, we may 
soon be facing a world of 15 billion 

GALAXY 



people and more, a world in which 
it’s all we can do to stay alive; a 
world without the investment re- 
sources to go into space and get 
rich. Usually I think it won’t come 
to that; it’s only in odd moments — 
such as when faced with The 
Question — that I get depressed. 

I don’t think it will come to that, 
because the vision of the future is 
so clear to me. 

We need realize only one thing: 
we do not inhabit “Only One 
Earth.” 

Mankind doesn’t live on Earth. 
We live in a solar system of nine 
planets, 34 moons, and over half a 
million asteroids. That system cir- 
cles a rather small and unimportant 
star that is part of a galaxy contain- 
ing tens of billions of stars. Only 
One Earth, indeed! There are mil- 
lions of Earths out there, and if we 
use up this one, we’ll just have to 
go find another, that’s all. 

But we needn’t use up this one. 
In the March column I went through 
the numbers: how we can, with 
present-day technology, deliver here 
to Earth as much metal for each 
person in the world as the US dis- 
posed of per capita in the 60’s. We 
can do that without polluting our 
planet at all, and we can keep it up 
for tens of thousands of years. The 
metal is out there in the asteroid 
belt. We don’t even have to look 
very hard; most of the asteroids 
were once spherical, large enough 
to have metallic cores, and now the 
worthless gubbage topside has been 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



knocked away, exposing all that 
lovely iron and lead and tin and 
such we’ll need to give the 
wretched of the Earth real freedom. 

Why not? The refinery power’s 
there; the Sun gives it off for free. 
We have a propulsion system to get 
us to the asteroids. Project NERVA 
was cancelled, but the research was 
done, and it wouldn’t be that hard 
to start up again. Nuclear-powered 
rockets would be rather simple to 
build, if we wanted them. 

But first we’ll need a Moonbase. 
We can get that by carrying stuff up 
bit by bit from the top of disinteg- 
rating totem poles. But there are 
easier ways. 

We could do it in one whack. 
Project ORION was also cancelled, 
but we could build old Bang-Bang 
in a very few years if we wanted to. 
ORION used the simplest and most 
efficient method of nuclear propul- 
sion of all: take a BIG plate, quite 
thick and hard. Attach by shock- 
absorbers a large space-going cap- 
sule to it. Put underneath one each 
atomic bomb. Fire away. 

Believe me, your ship will move. 
When you’ve used up the momen- 
tum imparted by the first bomb, 
fling another down underneath. Re- 
peat as required. For the expendi- 
ture of a small part of the world’s 
nuclear-weapon stockpile you have 
put several million pounds into or- 
bit, or on the Lunar surface. 

But that will cause fallout. 

Yes; some. Not very much, com- 
pared to what we have already 



47 



added to background radiation, but 
perhaps enough that we don’t want 
to use ORION — although (he said 
happily), ORION is one reason why 
I think we’ll eventually do what has 
to be done, even if this generation 
fails in its duties to the future. 
ORION is cheap and the bombs 
won’t go away; if we’re still alive 
in that grim world of 15-20 billion 
and no space program, somebody’ s 
going to revive Bang-Bang and get 
out there. 

ORION gets a few big payloads 
to orbit or the Moon. A more sys- 
tematic way would be to build a big 
laser-launching system and make it 
accessible to anyone with a payload 
to put into orbit. Freeman Dyson 
calls laser-launch systems “space 

48 



highways.” The government builds 
the launch system, and can use it 
for its own purposes. But it also 
gives private citizens, consortiums, 
firms, a means of reaching orbit. 

Dyson envisions a time when in- 
dividual families can buy a space 
capsule, and once Out There, can 
do as they like. Settle on the Moon, 
stay in orbit, go find an asteroid: 
whatever. It will be a while before 
we can build cheap self-contained 
space capsules operable by the likes 
of you and me, but it may not be 
anywhere near as long as you think. 

The problem is the engines, of 
course. There’s nothing else in the 
space-home economy that couldn’t, 
at least in theory, be built for about 
the total cost of a family home, car, 

GALAXY 



and recreational vehicle. But then 
most land-based prefabricated 
homes don’t have their own motive 
power either; they have to hire a 
truck for towing. 

It could make quite a picture: a 
train of space capsules departing 
Earth orbit for Ceres and points 
outward, towed by a ship something 
like the one I described in 
“Tinker”. Not quite Ward Bond in 
“Wagon Train,” but it could still 
make a good TV series. The cap- 
sules don’t have to be totally self- 
sufficient, of course. It’s easy 
enough to imagine way stations 
along the route, the space equiva- 
lent of filling stations in various or- 
bits. 

Dyson is fond of saying that the 
US wasn’t settled by a big govern- 
ment settlement program, but by in- 
dividuals and families who often 
had little more than courage and de- 
termination when they started. 
Perhaps that dream of the ultimate 
in freedom is too visionary; but if 
so, it isn’t because the technology 
won’t exist. 

However we build our Moonbase, 
it’s a very short step from there to 
asteroid mines. Obviously the Moon 
is in Earth-orbit, and with the shal- 
low Lunar gravity well it’s no trick 
at all to get away from the Moon; 
Earth-orbit is halfway to anywhere 
in the solar system. 

We don’t know what minerals 
will be available on the Moon. 
Probably it will take a while before 
it gets too expensive to dig them 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



up, but as soon as it does, the 
Lunatics themselves will want to go 
mine the asteroids. 

There’s probably more water ice 
in the Belt than there is on Luna, so 
for starters there will be water pros- 
pectors moving about among the as- 
teroids. The same technology that 
sends water to Luna will send met- 
als to Earth -orbit. I’ve already de- 
scribed one ship that can do the job. 
There are others. The boron fusion- 
fission process is a good example. 

Take boron-11 ( n Bs). Bombard 
with protons. The result is a com- 
plex reaction that, ends with helium 
and no nuclear particles. It could be 
a direct spacedrive. For those in- 
terested, the basic equation is 

“Bs + p = 3( 4 He2> + 16MeV, 
and 16 million electron volts gives 
pretty energetic helium. The exhaust 
velocity is better than 10,000 
kilometers/second, giving a theoret- 
ical specific impulse (Isp) of some- 
thing over a million. For compari- 
son the Isp of our best chemical 
rockets is about 400, and NERVA 
manages something like 1200, The 
boron drive needn’t be used very ef- 
ficiently to send ships all over the 
solar system. 

Meanwhile, NERVA or the 
fission-ion drive I described in an 
earlier column will do the job. In 
fact, it’s as simple to get refined 
metals from the asteroid belt to 
near-Earth orbit as it is to bring 
them down from the Lunar surface. 
It takes longer, but who cares? If I 
can promise GM steel at less than 



49 



they’re now paying, they’ll be glad 
to sign a “futures” contract, pay- 
ment on delivery. 

It’s going to be colorful out in 
the Belt, with huge mirrors boiling 
out chunks from mile-round rocks, 
big refinery ships moving from rock 
to rock; mining towns, boomtowns, 
and probably travelling entertain- 
ment vessels. Perhaps a few scenes 
from the wild west? “Claim jum- 
pers! Grab your rifle — ” 

Thus from the first Moonbase 
we’ll move rapidly, first to establish 
other Moon colonies (the Moon’s a 
big place) and out to the asteroid 
belt. After that we can either build 
O’Neill colonies (see “Blueprint for 
Survival”, May 1976 Galaxy) or 
stay with planets and Moons. But I 
suspect we’ll do both: while one 
group starts constructing flying 
city-states at the Earth-Moon Trojan 
Points, another will decide to 
make-do with Mars. 

Mars and Venus aren’t terribly 
comfortable places. In fact you 
probably won’t want to land on 
Venus at all until it has been ter- 
raformed. On the other hand, Venus 
will be far easier to make into a 
shirt-sleeves inhabitable world. 
We’ve described how in an earlier 
column. It requires only biological 
packages and some fertilizers and 
nutrients, and can be done from 
Moonbase, or in a pinch, from 
Earth itself. But while Venus may 
be the simpler job, Mars is likely to 
come first, simply because you can 
_ live there prior to terraforming; 

50 



there will be people establishing 
dome colonies on the Red Planet. 

I wrote a story (“Birth of Fire”) 
describing one Mars-terraforming 
project: melt the polar caps and ac- 
tivate a number of Martian vol- 
canoes to get an atmosphere built 
up. Isaac Asimov described the 
final step many years ago: get your 
ice from Out There, at Jupiter or 
Saturn, and fling it downhill to 
Mars. Freeman Dyson points out 
that there’s enough ice on En- 
celadus (a Saturnian moon) to keep 
the Martian climate warm for 
10,000 years. The deserts of Mars 
can become gardens in less than a 
century. 

Dyson’s scheme doesn’t even in- 
volve human activity on Enceladus; 
robots and modern computers could 
probably accomplish the job. 
They’ve only to construct some big 
catapults on the surface of En- 
celadus, and build some solar sails. 
Dyson suggests robots because the 
project as described would take a 
long time, and human supervisors 
might not care for the work. But I 
suspect we could get plenty of vol- 
unteers if we needed them. Why 
not? No one could complain that the 
work was trivial, and you couldn’t 
ask for an apartment with a better 
view than Saturn’s Rings! 

Moonbases. Lunar cities. Mining 
communities in the asteroid belt. 
Domed colonies on Mars, with 
prospects for terraforming the planet 
and turning it into a paradise. An 
advanced engineering project head- 

GALAXY 



quarters on Enceladus. Pollution 
controlled on Earth, because most 
polluting activities would go on in 
space. Near-earth space factories. 
Several to hundreds of city-states at 
the Trojan Points of the Earth-Moon 
system. A space population of mil- 
lions, with manned and unmanned 
ships stitching all the space habitats 
together. This is not a dream world; 
this is a world we could make in a 
hundred years! 

In 1872 a number of Kiowa and 
Comanche Chiefs were taken to 
Washington by Quakers in an at- 
tempt to show the Indians just what 
they were facing. When they re- 
turned to talk about the huge cities, 
and “a stone tipi so large that all 
the Kiowa could sit under it,” they 
were not believed. One suspects 
that if the Quaker schoolmasters had 
been magically transported to the 
Washington of 1976 and then re- 
turned to their own time they would 
not be believed either. A nation of 
over 200 million people? Millions 
of tons of concrete poured into 
gigantic highways? Aircraft larger 
than the biggest sailing ships? City 
streets brightly lit at night? Millions 
of tons of steel, farmlands from 
Kansas to California . 

Building a space civilization in 
the next hundred years will be sim- 
pler than than it was getting to 
where we are from 1876. We al- 
ready know how to do it. We prob- 
ably don’t know how we will do it; 
certainly the very act of space exp- 
loration will generate new ideas and 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 




techniques as alien to us as nuclear 
energy would have been to Lord 
Rutherford or Benjamin Franklin. 
But we already know how we could 
do it. No basic new discoveries 
necessary. 

In the 1940’s I did a class report 
on space travel. I drew heavily from 
Astounding, from Heinlein’s Future 
History, from Willy Ley’s books on 
rockets and space travel (and cer- 
tainly never thought I would some- 
day be writing a column in the 
same magazine as Willy). My 
teachers were tolerant. They let me 
do it. They didn’t believe in 
suppressing their pupils. Af- 
terwards, though, the physics 
teacher called me in for a confer- 
ence: I should learn some good 
basic science and get my head out 
of the clouds. That Buck Rogers 

51 



Stuff was fine for amusement — he 
read it himself — but in the real 
world . 

In the real world I got a letter 
from that teacher, who had the hon- 
esty to send a note in August, 1969, 
apologizing to me and expressing 
gratitude that he’d not been able to 
discourage me from those crazy 
dreams. I wish he were still alive so 
I could find out his reaction to this 
column. 

It’s not crazy dreams. It’s not 
even Far Out. It’s only basic en- 
gineering, and some economics, and 
a bit of hope. I may even have been 
too conservative. It probably won’t 
take a hundred years. 

Given the basic space civilization 
I’ve described, we’ll have accom- 
plished one goal: no single accident, 
no war, no one insane action will 
finish us off. We won’t have to 
have outgrown our damn foolish- 
ness to insure our survival as a 
species. Perhaps we’ll all be adults, 
mature, satisfied with what we 
have, long past wars and conflicts 
and the like. But I doubt it. At 
least, though, there will be no way 
to exterminate mankind, even if we 
manage to make the Earth unin- 
habitable. And it’s unlikely that any 
group, nation, or ideology can en- 
slave everyone. That’s worth some- 
thing. 

One suspects, too, that there will 
be an enormous diversity of cul- 
tures. Travel times between various 
city-states — asteroid, Martian, Lu- 
nar, O’Neill colony, Saturnian for- 

52 



ward base, Jovian Trojan Point — 
will be weeks to months to years 
with presently forseeable technol- 
ogy. That’s likely to change, but by 
the time the faster travel systems 
are in widespread use the cultural 
diversities will be established. 
Meanwhile, communication among 
all the various parts of the solar sys- 
tem will be simple and relatively 
cheap, so that there will have been 
that unifying influence; cultures will 
become different because people 
want to be different, not because 
they don’t know any better. 

OK. In 100 years we’ll have built 
a space civilization. We’ll no longer 
have really grinding poverty, al- 
though there will undoubtedly be 
people who consider themselves 
poor, just as we have today people 
who while living better than the 
aristocrats of 1776 think themselves 
in terrible straights. We’ll have in- 
sured against any man-made disaster 
wiping out the race. So what’s next, 
besides more of the same? 

Why, we haven’t even got started 
yet! “Be fruitful and multiply, and 
fill the face of the Earth,’’ said the 
command; soon that will have been 
done; and some day we’ll even run 
up against a filled solar system. 

The first step is obvious. We can 
begin taking some of the more use- 
less planets apart. They’ve got all 
that lovely mass, and it’s concen- 
trated so that we can’t use it; better 
to make proper use of, say, Jupiter, 
and Mercury, and someday perhaps 
even Mars and Venus, despite our 

GALAXY 



having terraformed them. 

At a thousand tons of mass per 
person. Mercury, taken apart, Could 
provide living space for 3 x 10 20 
people — that’s 300 billion billion, 
rather a large population. People in 
the US at present dispose of about 
10 18 ergs per capita each year; 
small potatoes for a space civiliza- 
tion. Let’s figure that our space 
people will need a million times 
that much, 10 24 ergs per each per 
year, or a total of 3 x 10 44 ergs for 
the people living on the skeleton of 
Mercury. 

It’s too much. The Sun only puts 
out 2 x 10 39 ergs each year, and we 
can’t catch all that. It seems we’ll 
run out of energy before we run out 
of mass, and that mass is too handy 
to use up freely as energy. Back to 
energy conservation! To support a 
really large population, though, 
we’ll have to destroy some matter. 
Obviously that can’t go on forever: 
so, while we’re destroying matter, 
we may as well go elsewhere. 

Meanwhile, though the stay-at- 
homes will busily take planets apart 
for their mass, so filling space with 
flying cities that they’ll soon catch 
great quantities of solar energy. 
You can just hear the asteroid 
civilizations (what’s left of them) 
complaining about those closer in 
taking up all the light. Perhaps the 
Rockrats will be the first to say the 
Hell with it and leave, looking for a 
place to live where there’s elbow 
room. Just too crowded in the Solar 
System. “Not like when I was a 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



kid, Martha. Not room to swing a 
cat nowadays.” 

They can take their whole civili- 
zation with them. The negotiations 
may take some time; the 
homebodies aren’t going to want to 
let all that nice matter leave the sys- 
tem forever. Perhaps the Rockrats 
will promise to send back a nice fat 
planet from wherever they’re going. 
It will take a while to pay off the 
debt, but they can pay it back with 
very high interest. 

The trip will take many years, 
but so what? The Rockrats have 
taken their civilization with them. 
They’ll miss the Sun, and by the 
time they arrive they’ll have used 
up most of their asteroid, but by 
then people will live long 
lifetimes — and they’ll darned well 
know how to exploit the new stellar 
system. “We’ll do it right, Martha! 
None of those upstart places like 
Freedonia!” 

Of course they’ll already know 
about the planets in their new sys- 
tem. There’s no real limit to the 
size of telescope you can build in 
space, and no problem about seeing; 
and with the lengthy baseline of the 
orbit of Ceres, or Jupiter’s Trojans, 
or a Saturnian moon, astronomers 
will long since have discovered all 
the planets of all the nearby stars. 
There will probably have been pro- 
bes sending back high-resolution 
pictures and making certain our col- 
onists aren’t heading for an 
already-occupied system. 

And so it goes; across the 

53 



Galaxy, as mankind fills system 
after system, and somebody begins 
to feel crowded. You’ll note I 
haven’t even postulated faster- than- 
light-travel. I have given us matter 
annihilation, although that’s not 
strictly necessary. 

And beyond that? When we’ve 
tapped all the resources of easily 
available planets, and are still run- 
ning out of metals and just plain 
mass? Well, there are stars — 

Take an old star. A red giant, 
perhaps. Useless. No planets left — 
all consumed in the nova explosion 
that formed an ordinary star into a 
red giant. The poor thing is doomed 
in a few million years anyway; why 
not hurry it along? When it blows 
up, it will give off all kinds of use- 
ful materials. 

Of course the star is a long way 
from civilization. The minerals 
could be picked up after the explo- 
sion, but maybe there’s a better 
way: bring your planet-sized spacec- 
raft reasonably near the target star. 
Turn on the matter annihilators and 
focus the resulting energy into a 
rather powerful laser beam. Shine it 
properly on the star. That’s what 
you’re going to do to blow it up 
anyway, but if you’re selective 
enough about it you can turn the 
star itself into a rocket. Heat up this 
side, let it spew out starstuff, and it 
will move. Granted that’s a slow 
process, and perhaps there’ll be no 
economic incentive; but stranger 
things have happened in history. 
After all, the expedition will save 

54 



its parent civilization. And life 
aboard the control planet need not 
be any more dull than, say, living 
in a colliery town; or going every 
day down to work at BBD&O . 

★ ★ ★ 

But we needn’t think about mov- 
ing stars, or travelling to other stel- 
lar systems, anymore than Colum- 
bus and the Vikings had Cape 
Canaveral in mind. For the moment 
we need only concentrate on the 
next hundred years. There’s quite 
enough to do right here. 

In fact, I can just hear it now: 
“What good does it do to get 
people dreaming about that Buck 
Rogers Stuff? Why waste money on 
interstellar research when there’s 
need for the money right here on 
the Trojan Points?” 

Only One Earth indeed. ★ 




Part II of III 

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

By name / am Robinette Broadhead, 
and by profession 1 am rich retired 
millionaire. I am so rich that I can af- 
ford the best psychiatrist in New York, 
who happens to be a machine whom / 
call Sigfrid von Shrink. / suppose all 
that sounds pretty gay and jolly, but 
there’s nothing funny about Sigfrid. 
He hurts me a lot. 

Sigfrid would say that was untrue. 
He would say that the pain comes out 
of the inner parts of me, and especially 
out of my life, which, to be sure, has 
not been all pleasure. I grew up in the 
Wyoming food mines. You know what 
that’s like. Sheer hell. You dig the 
shale, boil out the oil, grow the 
single-cell protein on the oil 
substrate — and after a while you learn 
to hold out a little for yourself, to fer- 
ment and drink so you can forget what 
kind of a life you’re living. There were 
six or seven million of us doing that in 
just my part of the world when I was 
young. Not one of us had anything to 
look forward to but spending our 
whole lives in the hydrocarbon smog of 
Wyoming, with kerogen ground into 
the pores of our skin and the roots of 
our hair. But for me it turned out dif- 
ferent. I had a stroke of luck. I won a 
lottery, and I came out of it with 
enough money to buy a one-way ticket 
to Gateway, and thus to possess the 
right to take part in the biggest lottery 
of them all: the chance to explore the 
universe for fun, profit and a first-rate 
shot at an early and unpleasant death. 
( l said it was a stroke of luck. I didn’t 
say it was good luck.) 

Gateway was Something Else. It 

56 



hung out in space, waiting for people 
to come and find it. It wasn’t a natural 
object. It was an artifact, the 
hollowed-out shell of an asteroid or 
maybe the core of a comet, no one was 
quite sure. Its surface was studded 
with interstellar spaceships, all fueled 
and aimed and ready to take off for the 
ends of the Galaxy. There were a 
couple of problems. For one, although 
Gateway wasn’t natural, it wasn’t 
man-made either. It was made by that 
long-lost and not altogether com- 
prehensible race called the Heechee, 
and abandoned by them along about 
the time Australopithecus africanus 
first learned how to bash an enemy’s 
head in with the thighbone of an an- 
telope. For another, you never knew 
quite where you were going. The au- 
tomatic navigation was quite efficient, 
but it had been preset by Heechee 
hands half a million years ago. When 
you got into a ship you might come out 
in orbit around a fair green planet 
loaded with treasure. You might also 
come out in the photosphere of a star. 
Or you might never come back at all, 
and no one would ever know why. 

Everybody on Gateway was part of 
the exploration team, that was why 
they were there. Some were just wait- 
ing for the flight that would make 
them rich, like my friend Gelle-Klara 
Moynlin. Some were waiting for I 
don’t know what, like my other friend 
Shikitei Bakin, who had lost his legs 
and a lot of his courage in some acci- 
dent or other, and stayed on Gateway, 
maybe, mostly because it had so close 
to no gravity at all that he could get 
around by strapping wings to his arms 
and flying where he wanted to go. 
After I got to Gateway, and took the 
laughably brief course in interstellar 

GALAXY 



navigation and so on (what did you 
have to know when the ships knew 
where they were going, and wouldn’t 
tell?), I found I was waiting too. What 
I was waiting for was to find some- 
thing / had misplaced, namely my 
guts. My girl-friend Sheri, who came 
up with me, finally got tired of waiting 
and signed for a trip. She asked me to 
go along. 

It took all the rationalizing I could 
manage to think of a reason for not 
going with her, but / did it. I was get- 
ting very good at not seizing opportu- 
nity when it presented itself, and at not 
facing up to the reason why. 



XII 

I came back to my room one 
morning and found the P-phone 
whining faintly, like a distant, 
angry mosquito. I punched the mes- 
sage code and found that the Assis- 
tant Personnel Director required my 
presence in her office at ten 
hundred hours that morning. Well, 
it was later than that already. I had 
formed the habit of spending a lot 
of time, and most nights, with 
Klara. Her pad was a lot more com- 
fortable than mine. So I didn’t get 
the message until nearly eleven, and 
when I got to the Corporation per- 
sonnel offices it didn’t help her 
mood that I was late. 

She was a very fat woman named 
Emma Fother. She brushed off my 
excuses and accused, “You 
graduated your courses seventeen 
days ago. You haven’t done a thing 
since.” 

“I’m waititing for the right mis- 



sion,” I said. 

“How long are you going to 
wait? Your per-capita’s paid up for 
three more days, then what?” 
“Well,” I said, almost truthfully, 
“I was going to come in to see you 
about that today anyway. I’d like a 
job here on Gateway.” 

“Pshaw,” (I’d never heard any- 
one say that before, but that's how 
it sounded.) “Is that why you came 
to Gateway, to clean sewers?” 

I was pretty sure that was a bluff, 
because there weren’t that many 
sewers; there wasn’t enough gravity 
flow to support them. “The right 
mission could come along any 
day.” 

“Oh, sure, Bob. You know, 
people like you worry me. Do you 
have any idea how important our 
work here is?” 

“Well, I think so — ” 

“There’s a whole universe out 
there for us to find and bring home! 
Gateway’s the only way we can 
reach it. A person like you, who 
grew up on the plankton farms — ” 
“Actually it was the Wyoming 
food mines.” 

“Whatever! You know how des- 
perately the human race needs 
what we can give them. New 
technology. New power sources. 
Food! New worlds to live in.” She 
shook her head and punched 
through the sorter on her desk, 
looking both angry and worried. I 
supposed that she was check-rated 
on how many of us idlers and para- 
sites she managed to get to go out, 
the way we were supposed to, 
which accounted for her hostility —

first place. She abandoned the sorter 
and got up to open a file against the 
wall. “Suppose I do find you a 
job,” she said over her shoulder. 
“The only skill you have that’s any 
use here is prospecting.” 

“I’ll take — almost anything.” 

She looked at me quizzically, and 
then returned to her desk. She was 
astonishingly graceful, considering 
she had to mass a hundred kilos. 
Maybe a fat woman’s fantasy of not 
sagging accounted for her desire to 
hold this job and stay on Gateway. 
“You’ll be doing the lowest kind of 
labor,” she warned. “We don’t pay 
much for that. One-eighty a day.”

“I’ll take it!” 

“Your per-capita has to come out 
of it. Take that away and maybe 
twenty dollars a day for toke 
money, and what do you have 
left?” 

“I could always do odd jobs if I 
needed more.” 

She sighed. “You’re just post- 
poning the day, Bob. I don’t know. 
Mr. Hsien, the Director, keeps a 
very close watch on job applica- 
tions. I’ll find it very hard to justify 
hiring you. And what are you going 
to do if you get sick and can’t 
work? Who’ll pay your tax?” 

“I’ll go back, I guess.” 

“And waste all your training? 
You disgust me. Bob.” 

But she punched me out a work- 
ticket that instructed me to report to 
the Crew Chief on Level Grand, 
Sector North, for assignment in 
plant maintenance. 

I didn’t like that interview with 
Emma Fother, but I had been 
warned I wouldn’t. When I talked it 
over with Klara that evening she 
told me actually I’d got off light. 

“You’re lucky you drew Emma. 
Old Hsien sometimes keeps people 
hanging until their tax money’s all 
gone.” 

“Then what?” I got up and sat 
on the edge of her cot, feeling for 
my footgloves. “Out the airlock?” 

“Don’t make fun, it could con- 
ceivably come to that. Hsien’ s an 
old Mao type, very hard on social 
wastrels.” 

“You’re a fine one to talk!” 

She grinned, rolled over and rub- 
bed her nose against my back. 
“The difference between you and 
me, Bob,” she said, “is that I have 

GALAXY 



a couple of bucks stashed away 
from my first mission. It didn’t pay 
big, but it paid somewhat. Also I’ve 
been out, and they need people like 
me for teaching people like you.” 

I leaned back against her hip, 
half turned and put my hand on her, 
more reminiscently than aggres- 
sively. There were certain subjects 
we didn’t talk much about, but — 
“Klara?” 

“Uh?” 

“What’s it like, on a mission?” 
She rubbed her chin against my 
forearm for a moment, looking at 
the holoview of Venus against the 
wall. "... Scary,” she said. 

I waited, but she didn’t say any 
more about it, and that much I al- 
ready knew. I was scared right there 
on Gateway. I didn’t have to launch 
myself on the Heechee Mystery Bus 
Trip to know what being scared was 
like, 1 could feel it already. 

“You don’t really have a choice, 
dear Bob,” she said, almost ten- 
derly, for her. 

I felt a sudden rush of anger. 
“No, I don’t! You’ve exactly de- 
scribed my whole life, Klara. I’ve 
never had a choice — except once, 
when I won the lottery and decided 
to come here. And I’m not sure I 
made the right decision then.” 

She yawned, and rubbed against 
my arm for a moment. “If we’re 
through with sex,” she decided, “I 
want something to eat before I go to 
sleep. Come on up to the Blue Hell 
with me and I’ll treat.”

Plant Maintenance was, actually, 
the maintenance of plants: specifi- 
cally, the ivy plants that help keep 
Gateway liveable. I reported for 

GATEWAY 



duty and, surprise — in fact, nice 
surprise — my crew boss turned out 
to be my legless neighbor, Shikitei 
Bakin. 

He greeted me with what seemed 
like real pleasure. “How nice of 
you to join us, Robinette,” he said. 
“I expected you would ship out at 
once.” 

“I will, Shicky, pretty soon. 
When I see the right launch listed 
on the board, I’ll know it.” 

“Of course.” He left it at that, 
and introduced me to the other Plant 
Maintainers. I didn’t get them 
straight, except that the girl had had 
some sort of connection with Pro- 
fessor Hegramet, the hotshot 
Heecheeologist back home, and the 
two men had each had a couple of 
missions already. I didn’t really 
need to get them straight. We all 
understood the essential fact about 
each other without discussion. None 
of us was quite ready to put our 
names on the launch roster. 

I wasn’t even quite ready to let 
myself think out why. 

Plant Maintenance would have 
been a good place for thought, 
though. Shicky put me to work 
right away, fastening brackets to the 
Heechee-metal walls with tacky- 
gunk. That was some kind of spe- 
cially designed adhesive. It would 
hold to both the Heechee metal and 
the ribbed foil of the plant boxes, 
and it did not contain any solvent 
that would evaporate and contami- 
nate the air. It was supposed to be 
very expensive. If you got it on you 
you just learned to live with it, at 
least until the skin it was on died 
and flaked off. If you tried to get it 
off any other way you drew blood.

When the day’s quota of brackets 
were up we all trooped down to the 
Sewage Plant, where we picked up 
boxes filled with sludge and cov- 
ered with cellulose film. We settled 
them onto the brackets, twisted the 
self-locking nuts to hold them in 
place and fitted them with watering 
tanks. The boxes probably would 
have weighed a hundred kilos each 
on Earth but on Gateway that sim- 
ply wasn’t a consideration; even the 
foil they were made of was enough 
to support them rigidly against the 
brackets. Then, when we were all 
done, Shicky himself filled the trays 
with seedlings, while we went on to 
the next batch of brackets. It was 
funny to watch him. He carried 
trays of the infant ivy plants on 
straps around his neck, like a 
cigarette girl’s stock. He held him- 
self at tray level with one hand, and 
poked seedlings through the film 
into the sludge with the other. 

It was a low-pressure job, it 
served a useful function (I guess) 

60 



and it passed the time. Shicky 
didn’t make us work any too hard. 
He had set a quota in his mind for a 
day’s work. As long as we got sixty 
brackets installed and filled he 
didn’t care if we goofed off, pro- 
vided we were inconspicuous about 
it, Klara would come by to pass the 
time of day now and then, some- 
times with the little girl, and we 
had plenty of other visitors. And 
when times were slack and there 
wasn’t anybody interesting to talk 
to, one at a time we could wander 
off for an hour or so. I explored a 
lot and each day decision was post- 
poned. 

We all talked about going out. 
Almost every day we could hear the 
thud and vibration as some lander 
cut itself loose from its dock, push- 
ing the whole ship out to where the 
Heechee main drive could go into 
operation. Almost as often we felt 
the different kind of smaller, 
quicker shock when some ship re- 
turned. In the evenings we went to 
someone’s parties. My whole class 
was gone by now, almost. Sheri 
had shipped out on a Five — I didn’t 
see her to ask her why she changed 
her plans, and wasn’t sure I really 
wanted to know; the ship she went 
on had an otherwise all-male crew. 
They were German-speaking, but I 
guess Sheri figured she could get by 
pretty well without talking much. 
The last one was Willa Forehand. 
Klara and I went to Willa’s farewell 
party, and then down to the docks 
to watch her launch the next morn- 
ing. I was supposed to be working, 
but I didn’t think Shicky would 
mind. Unfortunately Mr. Hsien was 
there too, and I could see that he 
recognized me. 



GALAXY 



“Oh, shit,” I said to Klara. 

She giggled and took my hand, 
and we ducked out of the launch 
area. We strolled away until we 
came to an up-shaft and lifted to the 
next level. We sat down on the 
edge of Lake Superior. “Bob old 
stud,” she said, “I doubt he’ll fire 
you for screwing off one time. 
Chew you out, probably.” 

I shrugged and tossed a chip of 
filter-pebble into the upcurving 
lake, which stretched a good two 
hundred meters up and around the 
shell of Gateway in front of us. I 
was feeling tacky, and wondering 
whether I was reaching the point 
when the bad vibes about risking 
nasty death in space were being 
•overtaken by the bad vibes about 
cowering on Gateway. It’s a funny 
thing about fear. I didn’t feel it. I 
knew that the only reason I was 
staying on was that I was afraid, 
but it didn’t feel as though I were 
afraid, only reasonably prudent. 

“I think,” I said, watching my- 
self going into the sentence without 
being sure how it was going to 
come out, “that I’m going to do it. 
Want to come along?” 

Klara sat up and shook herself. 
She took a moment before she said, 
“Maybe. What’ve you got in 
mind?” 

I had nothing in mind. I was only 
a spectator, watching myself talk 
myself into something that made my 
toes curl. But I said, as though I 
had planned it out for days, “I 
think it might be a good idea to 
take a rerun.” 

“No deal!” She looked almost 
angry. “If I go, I go where the real 
money is.” 

That was also where the real

danger was, of course. Although 
even reruns have turned out bad 
often enough. 

The thing about reruns is that you 
start out with the knowledge that 
somebody has already flown that 
trip and made it back, and, not only 
that, made a find that’s worth fol- 
lowing up on. Some of them are 
pretty rich. There’s Peggy’s World, 
where the heater coils and the fur 
come from. There’s Eta Carina

Seven, which is probably full of 
good stuff if you could only get at 
it. The trouble is, it has had an ice 
age since the Heechees were last on 
it. The storms are terrible. Out of 
five landers, one returned with a 
full crew, undamaged. One didn’t 
return at all. 

Generally speaking, Gateway 
doesn’t particularly want you to do 
a rerun. They will make a cash 
offer instead of a percentage where 
the pickings are fairly easy, as on 
Peggy. What they pay for is not so 
much trade goods as maps. So you 
go out there and you spend your 
time making orbital runs, trying to 
find the geological anomalies that 
indicate Heechee digs may be pres- 
ent. You may not land at all. The 
pay is worth having, but not lavish. 
You’d have to make at least twenty 
runs to build up a lifetime stake, if 
you take the Corporation’s one-pay 
deal. And if you decide to go on 
your own, prospecting, you have to 
pay a share of your profits to the 
discovery crew, and a cut on what’s 
left of your share to the Corpora- 
tion. You wind up with a fraction 
of what you might get on a virgin 
find, even if you don’t have a col- 
ony already established on the scene 
to contend with. 

Or you can take a shot at the 
bonuses: A hundred million dollars 
if you find an alien civilization, 
fifty million for the first crew to lo- 
cate a Heechee ship bigger than a 
Five, a million bucks to locate a 
habitable planet. 

Seems funny that they would 
only pay a lousy million for a 
whole new planet? But the trouble 
is, once you’ve found it, what do 
you do with it? You can’t export a 

62 



lot of surplus population when you 
can only move them four at a time. 
That, plus the pilot, is all you can 
get into the largest ship in Gateway. 
(And if you don’t have a pilot, you 
don’t get the ship back.) So the 
Corporation has underwritten a few 
little colonies, one’s very healthy on 
Peggy and the others are spindly. 
But that does not solve the problem 
of twenty-five billion human beings, 
most of them underfed. 

You’ll never get that kind of 
bonus on a rerun. Maybe you can’t 
get some of those bonuses at all; 
maybe the things they’re for don’t 
exist. 

It is strange that no one has ever 
found a trace of another intelligent 
creature. But in eighteen years, up- 
wards of two thousand flights, no 
one has. There are about a dozen 
habitable planets, plus another 
hundred or so that people could live 
on if they absolutely had to, as we 
have to on Mars and on, or rather 
in, Venus. There are a few traces of 
past civilizations, neither Heechee 
nor human. And there are the 
souvenirs of the Heechee them- 
selves. At that, there’s more in the 
warrens of Venus than we’ve found 
almost anywhere else in the Galaxy, 
so far. Even Gateway was swept 
almost clean before they abandoned 
it. 

Damn Heechee, why did they 
have to be so neat? 

★ ★ ★ 

So we gave up on the rerun 
deals, because there wasn’t enough 
money in them, and put the special 
finders’ bonuses out of our heads, 
because there’s just no way of plan- 

GATEWAY 



ning to look for them. 

And finally we just stopped talk- 
ing, and looked at each other, and 
then we didn’t even look at each 
other. 

No matter what we said, we 
weren’t going. We didn’t have the 
nerve. Klaras had run out on her 
last trip, and I guess I hadn’t ever 
had it. 

“Well,” said Klara, getting up 
and stretching, “I guess I’ll go up 
and win a few bucks at the casino. 
Want to watch?” 

I shook my head. “Guess I’d bet- 
ter get back to my job. If I still 
have one.” 

So we kissed good-by at the up- 
shaft, and when we came to my 
level I reached up and patted her 
ankle and jumped off. I was not in 
a very good mood. We had spent so 
much effort trying to reassure our- 
selves that there weren’t any 
launches that offered a promise of 
reward worth the risks that 1 almost 
believed it. 

Of course, we hadn’t even men- 
tioned the other kind of rewards: the 
danger bonuses. 

You have to be pretty frayed to 
go for them. Like, the Corporation 
will sometimes put up half a million 
or so incentive bonus for a crew to 
take the same course as some previ- 
ous crew tried . and didn’t come 
back from. Their reasoning is that 
maybe something went wrong with 
the ship, ran out of gas or some- 
thing, and a second ship might even 
rescue the crew from the first one. 
(Fat chance.) More likely, of 
course, whatever killed the first 
crew would still be there, and ready 
to kill you. 

Then there was a time when you 

GALAXY 



could sign up for a million, later 
they raised it to five million, if you 
would try changing the course set- 
tings after launch. 

The reason they raised the bonus 
to five million was that crews 
stopped volunteering when none of 
them, not one of them, ever came 
back. Then they cut it out, because 
they were losing too many ships, 
and finally they made it a flat 
no-no. Every once in a while they 
come up with a bastard control 
panel, a snappy new computer 
that’s supposed to work symbioti- 
eally with the Heechee board. 
Those ships aren’t good gambling 
bets, either. There’s a reason for the 
safety lock on the Heechee board. 
You can’t change destination while 
it’s on. Maybe you can’t change des- 
tination without destroying the ship 
at all. 

I saw five people try for a ten- 
million-dollar bonus once. Some 
Corporation genius from the perma- 
nent party was worrying about how 
to transport more than five people, 
or the equivalent in cargo, at once. 
We didn’t know how to build a 
Heechee ship, and we’d never 
found a really big one. So he fig- 
ured that maybe we could end-run 
around that obstacle by using a Five 
as a sort of tractor. 

So they built a sort of space 
barge out of Heechee metal. They 
loaded it with scraps of junk, and 
ran a Five out there on lander 
power. That’s just hydrogen and 
oxygen, and it’s easy enough to 
pump that back in. Then they tied 
the Five to the barge with monofil- 
ament Heechee metal cables. 

We watched the whole thing from 
Gateway on PV. We saw the cables 

63 



take up slack as the Five put a 
strain on them with its lander jets. 
Craziest looking thing you ever 
saw. 

Then they must have activated 
the long-range start teat. 

All we saw on the PV was that 
the barge sort of twitched, and the 
Five simply disappeared from sight. 

It never came back. The stop- 
motion tapes showed at least the 
first little bit of what happened. The 
cable truss had sliced that ship into 
segments like a hard-boiled egg. 
The people in it never knew what 
hit them. The Corporation still has 
that ten million, nobody else wants 
to try for it anymore. 

* * * 

I got a politely reproachful lec- 
ture from Shicky, and a really ugly, 
but brief, P-phone call from Mr. 
Hsien, but that was all. After a day 
or two Shicky began letting us take 
time off again. 

I spent most of it with Klara. A 
lot of times we’d arrange to meet in 
her pad, or once in a while mine, 
for an hour in bed. We were sleep- 
ing together almost every night; 
you’d think we would have had 
enough of that. We didn’t. After a 
while I wasn’t sure what we were 
copulating for, the fun of it or the 
distraction it gave from the contem- 
plation of our own self-images. I 
would lie there and look at Klara, 
who always turned over, snuggled 
down on her stomach and closed 
her eyes after sex, even when we 
were going to get up two minutes 
later. I would think how well I 
knew every fold and inch of her 
body. I would smell that sweet,

sexy smell of her and wish — oh, 
wish! Just wish, for things I 
couldn’t spell out: for an apartment 
under the Big Bubble with Klara, 
for an airbody and a cell in a Venu- 
sian tunnel with Klara, even for a 
life in the food mines with Klara. I 
guess it was love. But then I’d still 
be looking at her, and I would feel 
the inside of my eyes change the 
picture I was seeing, and what I 
would see would be the female 
equivalent of myself: A coward, 
given the greatest chance a human 
could have, and scared to take ad- 
vantage of it. 

When we weren’t in bed we 
would wander around Gateway to- 
gether. It wasn’t like dating. We 
didn’t go much to the Blue Hell or 

GALAXY 



the holofilm halls, or even eat out. 
Klara did. I couldn’t afford it, so I 
took most of my meals from the 
Corporation’s refectories, included 
in the price of my per capita per 
diem. Klara was not unwilling to 
pick up the check for both of us, 
but she wasn’t exactly anxious to do 
it, either — she was gambling pretty 
heavily, and not winning much. 
There were groups to be involved 
with — card parties, or just parties; 
folk dance groups, music listening 
groups, discussion groups. They 
were free, and sometimes interest- 
ing. Or we just explored. 

Several times we went to the 
museum. I didn’t really like it that 
much. It seemed . well ... re- 
proachful . 

The first time we went there was 
right after I got off work, the day 
Willa Forehand shipped out. Usu- 
ally the museum was full of vis- 
itors, like crew members on pass 
from the cruisers, or ship’s crews 
from the commercial runs, or 
tourists. This time, for some reason, 
there were only .a couple of pepple 
in it, and we had a chance to look 
at everything. Prayer fans by the 
hundreds, those little filmy, crystal- 
line things that were the commonest 
Heechee artifact; no one knew what 
they were for, except that they were 
sort of pretty, but the Heechee had 
left them all over the place. There 
was the original anisokinetic punch, 
that had earned some lucky prospec- 
tor something like twenty million 
dollars in royalties already. A thing 
you could put in your pocket. Furs. 
Plants in formalin. The original 
piezophone, that had earned three 
crews enough to make every one of 
them awfully rich, even though for 

GATEWAY 



some contractual reason in those 
days they had to share the royalties 
not only with each other but with 
the Corporation. 

The most easily swiped things, 
like the prayer fans and the blood 
diamonds and the fire pearls, were 
kept behind tough breakproof glass. 
I think they were even wired to 
burglar alarms. That was surprising, 
on Gateway. There isn’t any law 
there, except what the Corporation 
imposes. There are the Corpora- 
tion’s equivalent of police, and 
there are rules — you’re not sup- 
posed to steal or commit murder — 
but there aren’t any courts. If you 
break a rule all that happens is that 
the Corporation security force picks 
you up and takes you out to one of 
the orbiting cruisers. Your own, if 
there is one from wherever you 
come from. Any one, if not. But if 
they won’t take you, or if you don’t 
want to go on your own nation’s 
ship and can persuade some other 
ship to take you, Gateway doesn’t 
care. On the cruisers, you’ll get a 
trial. Since you’re known guilty to 
start with, you have three choices. 
One is to pay your way back home. 
The second is to sign on as crew if 
they’ll have you. The third is to go 
out the lock without a suit. So you 
see that, although there isn’t much 
law on Gateway, there isn’t much 
crime, either. 

But of course the reason for lock- 
ing up the precious stuff in the 
museum was that transients might 
be tempted to lift a souvenir or 
two. 

So Klara and I would muse over 
the treasures someone had found 
. and somehow not discuss with 
each other the fact that we were 

65 



supposed to go out and find some 
more. 

It was not just the exhibits. They 
were fascinating; they were things 
that Heechee hands (tentacles? 
claws?) had made and touched, and 
they came from unimaginable places 
incredibly far away. But the con- 
stantly flickering tube displays held 
me even more strongly. Summaries 
of every mission ever launched, 
displayed one after another. A con- 
stant total of missions versus re- 
turns; of royalties paid to lucky 
prospectors; the roster of the un- 
lucky ones, name after name in a 
slow crawl along one whole wall of 
the room, over the display cases. 
The totals told the story: 2355 
launches (the number changed to 
2356, then 2357 while we were 
there; we felt the shudder of the two 
launches), 841 successful returns. 

Klara and I didn’t look at each 
other, standing in front of that par- 
ticular display, but I felt her hand 
squeeze mine. 

That was defining “successful” 
very loosely. It meant that the ship 
had come back. It didn’t say any- 
thing about how many of the crew 
were alive and well. 

We turned and left the museum 
after that, and didn’t speak much on 
the way to the up-shaft. 

The thing in my mind was that 
what Emma Pother had said to me 
was true: the human race needed 
what we prospectors could give 
them. Needed it a lot. There were 
hungry people, and Heechee 
technology probably could make all 
their lives a lot more tolerable, if 
prospectors went out and brought 
samples of it back. 

Even if it cost a few lives. 



Even if the lives included Klara’s 
and mine. Did I, I asked myself, 
want my son — if I ever had a 
son — to spend his childhood the 
way 1 had spent mine? 

We dropped off the up-cable at 
Levef Babe and heard voices. I 
didn’t pay attention to them. I was 
coming to a resolution in my mind. 
“Klara,” I said, “listen. Let’s — ” 
But Klara was looking past my 
shoulder. “For Christ’s sake!” she 
said. “Look who’s here!” 

And I turned, and there was 
Shicky fluttering in the air, talking 
to a girl, and I saw with astonish- 
ment that the girl was Willa 
Forehand. She greeted us, looking 
both embarrassed and amused. 

“What’s going on?” 1 demanded. 
“Didn’t you just ship out — like 
maybe eight hours ago?” 

“Ten,” she said. 

“Did something go wrong with 
the ship, so you had to come 
back?” Klara guessed. 

Willa smiled ruefully. “Not a 
thing. I’ve been there and back. 
Shortest trip on record so far: I 
went to the Moon.” 

“ Earth’s moon?” 

“That’s the one.” She seemed to 
be controlling herself, to keep from 
laughter. Or tears. 

Shicky said consolingly, “They’ll 
surely give you a bonus, Willa. 
There was one that went to 
Ganymede once, and the Corpora- 
tion divvied up half a million dol- 
lars among them.” 

She shook her head. “Even I 
know better than that, Shicky, dear. 
Oh, they’ll award us something. 
But it won’t be enough to make a 
difference. We need more than 
that.” That was the unusual, and

somewhat surprising, thing about 
the Forehands: it was always “we”. 
They were clearly a very closely 
knit family, even if they didn’t like 
to discuss that fact with outsiders. 

I touched her, a pat between af- 
fection and compassion. “What are 
you going to do?’ ’ 

She looked at me with surprise. 
“Why, I’ve already signed up for 
another launch, day after tomor- 
row.” 

“Well!” said Klara. “We’ve got 
to have two parties at once for you! 
We’d better get busy. ...” And 
hours later, just before we went to 
sleep that night, she said to me, 
“Wasn’t there something you 
wanted to say to me before- we saw 
Willa?” 

“I forget,” I said sleepily. I 
hadn’t forgotten. I knew what it 
was. But I didn’t want to say it any 
more. 

There were days when I worked 

GATEWAY 



myself up almost to that point of 
asking Klara to ship out with me 
again. And there were days when a 
ship came in with a couple of 
starved, dehydrated survivors, or 
with no survivors, or when at the 
routine time a batch of last-year’s 
launches were posted as non- 
returns. On those days I worked 
myself up almost to the point of 
quitting Gateway completely. 

Most days we simply spent defer- 
ring decision. It wasn’t all that 
hard. It was a pretty pleasant way 
to live, exploring Gateway and each 
other. Klara took on a maid, a 
stocky, fair young woman from the 
food mines of Carmarthen named 
Hywa. Except that the feedstock for 
the Welsh single-cell protein fac- 
tories was coal instead of oil shale, 
her world had been almost exactly 
like mine. Her way out of it had not 
been a lottery ticket but two years 
as crew on a commercial spaceship. 
She couldn’t ever go back home. 
She had jumped ship on Gateway, 
forfeiting her bond of money she 
couldn’t pay. And she couldn’t 
prospect either, because her one 
launch had left her with a heart 
arhythmia that sometimes looked 
like it was getting better and some- 
times put her in Terminal Hospital 
for a week at a time. Hywa’s job 
was partly to cook and clean for 
KJara and me, partly to babysit the 
little girl, Kathy Francis, when 
her father was on duty and Klara 
didn’t want to be bothered. Klara 
had been losing pretty heavily at the 
casino, so she couldn’t afford 
Hywa, but then she couldn’t afford 
me either. 

What made it easy to turn off our 
insights was that we pretended to 

67 



each other, and sometimes to our- 
selves, that what we were doing 
was preparing ourselves, really 
well, for the day when the Right 
trip came alone. 

It wasn’t hard to do that. A lot of 
real prospectors did the same thing, 
between trips. There was a group 
that called itself The Heechee Seek- 
ers, that met on Wednesday nights; 
it had been started by a prospector 
named Sam Kahane, kept up by 
others while he was off on a trip 
that hadn’t worked out, and now 
had Sam back in it between trips, 
while he was waiting for the other 
two members of his crew to get 
back in shape for the next one. 
(Among other things, they had 
come back with scurvy, due to a 
malfunction in the food freezer.) 
Sam and his friends were gay, and 
apparently set in a permanent 
three-way relationship, but that 
didn’t affect his interest in Heechee 
lore. He had secured tapes of all the 
lectures of several courses on exo- 
studies from East Texas Reserve, 
where Professor Hegramet had 
made himself the world’s foremost 
authority on Heechee research. I 
learned a lot I hadn’t known, al- 
though the central fact, that there 
were far more questions than an- 
swers about the Heechee, was pretty 
well known to everybody. 

And we got into physical-fitness 
groups, where we practiced 
muscle-toning exercises that you 
could do without moving any limb 
more than a few inches, and mas- 
sage for fun and profit. It was prob- 
ably profitable, but it was even 
more fun, particularly sexually. 
Klara and I learned to do some as- 
tonishing things with each other’s 

68 



bodies. We took a cooking course 
(you can do a lot with standard ra- 
tions, if you add a selection of 
spices and herbs). We acquired a 
selection of language tapes, in the 
event we shipped out with non- 
English-speakers, and practiced 
taxi-driver Italian and Greek on 
each other. We even joined an as- 
tronomy group. They had access to 
Gateway’s telescopes, and we spent 
a fair amount of time looking at 
Earth and Venus from outside the 
plane of the ecliptic. Francy Hereira 
was in that group when he could get 
time off from the ship. Klara liked 
him, and so did I, and we formed 
the habit of having a drink in our 
rooms — well, Klara’s rooms, but I 
was spending a lot of time in 
them — with him after the group. 
Francy was deeply, almost sensu- 
ally, interested in what was Out 
There. He knew all about quasars 
and Black Holes and Seyfert 
galaxies, not to mention things like 
double stars and novae. We often 
speculated what it might be like to 
come out of a mission into the 
wavefront of a supernova. It could 
happen. The Heechee were known 
to have had an interest in observing 
astrophysical events first-hand. 
Some of their courses were undoubt- 
edly programmed to bring crews to 
the vicinity of interesting events, 
and a pre-supernova was certainly 
an interesting event. Only now it 
was a long lot later, and the super- 
nova might not be “pie” any more. 

“I wonder,” said Klara, smiling 
to show that it was only an abstact 
point she was putting to us, “if. that 
might not be what happened to 
some of the non-retum missions.” 

“It is an absolute statistical cer- 



GALAXY 



tainty,” said Francy, smiling back 
to show that he agreed to the rules 
of the-game. He had been practicing 
his English, which was pretty good 
to start with, and now he was al- 
most accent- free. He also possessed 
German, Russian and fair amounts 
of the other Romance languages to 
go with his Portugese, as we had 
discovered when we tried some of 
our language-tape conversation on 
each other and found he understood 
us better than we understood our- 
selves. “Nevertheless, people go.” 
Klara and I were silent for a 
moment, and then she laughed. 
“Some do,” she said. 

I cut in quickly, “It sounds as if 
you want to go yourself, Francy.” 
“Have you ever doubted it?” 
“Well, yes, actually I have. I 
mean, you’re in the Brazilian Navy. 
You can’t just take off, can you?” 
He corrected me: “I can take off 
at any time. I simply cannot go 
back to Brazil after that.” 

“And it’s worth that to you?” 
“It’s worth anything,” he told 
me. 

“Even — ” I pressed — ” if there’s 
the risk of not coming back, or of 
getting messed up like the return 
today?” That had been a Five that 
had landed on a planet with some 
sort of plant life like a poison-ivy. 
It had been a bad one, we had 
heard. 

“Yes, of course,” he said. 

Klara was getting restless. “I 
think,” she said, “I want to go to 
sleep now.” 

There was some extra message in 
the tone of her voice. I looked at 
her and said, “I’ll walk'you back to 
your room.” 

“That’s not necessary, Bob.” 

GATEWAY 



“I’ll do it anyhow,” I said, ig- 
noring the message. “Good night, 
Francie. See you next week.” 

Klara was already halfway to the 
down-shaft, and I had to hurry to 
catch up to her. I caught the cable 
and called down to her, “If you re- 
ally want me to, I’ll go back to my 
own place.” 

She didn’t look up, but she didn’t 
say that was what she wanted, 
either, so 1 got off at her level and 
followed her to her rooms. Kathy 
was sound asleep in the outer room, 
Hywa drowsing over a holodisk in 
our bedroom. Klara sent the maid 
home and went in to make sure the 
child was comfortable. I sat on the 
edge of the bed, waiting for her. 

“Maybe I’m pre-menstrual,” 
Klara said when she came back. 
“I’m sorry. I just feel edgy.” 

“I’ll go if you want me to.” 
“Jesus, Bob, quit saying that!” 
Then she sat down next to me and 
leaned against me so that I would 
put my arm around her. “Kathy’s 
so sweet,” she said after a moment, 
almost wistfully. 

“You’d like to have one of your 
own, wouldn’t you?” 

“I will have one of my own.” 
She leaned back, pulling me with 
her. “I wish I knew when, that’s 
all. I need a lot more money than I 
have to give a kid a decent life. 
And I’m not getting any younger.” 
We lay there for a moment, and 
then I said into her hair, “That’s 
what I want too, Klara.” 

She sighed. “Do you think I 
don’t know that?” Then she tensed 
and sat up. “Who’s that?” 
Somebody was scrabbling at the 
door. It wasn’t locked; we never did 
that. But nobody ever came in

A NOTE ON THE 
HEECHEE RUMP 

Professor Hegramet. We have 
no idea what the Heechee looked 
like except for inferences. Prob- 
ably they were bipeds. Their tools 
fit human hands tolerably well, so 
probably they had hands. Or 
something like them. They seem 
to have seen pretty much the 
same spectrum as we do. They 
must have been smaller than 
us — say, a hundred and fifty cen- 
timeters, or less. And they had 
funny-looking rumps. 

Questbn. What do you mean, 
funny-looking rumps? 

Professor Hegramet. Well, did 
you ever look at the pilot's seat in 
a Heechee ship? It's two flat 
pieces of metal joined in a V 
shape. You couldn't sit in it for 
ten minutes without pinching your 
bottom off. So what we have to 
do, we stretch a webbing seat 
across them. But that's human 
addition. The Heechee didn't 
have anything like that. 

So their bodies must have 
looked more or less like a wasp's, 
with this big abdomen hanging 
down, actually extending below 
the hips, between the legs. 

Question. Do you mean they 
might have had stingers like 
wasps? 

Professor Hegramet. Stingers. 
No. I don't think so. But maybe. 
Or maybe they had hell's own set 
of sex organs. 



without being invited, either, and 
this time someone did. 

“Sterling!” Klara said, surprised. 
She remembered her manners: 

70 



“Bob, this is Sterling Francis, 
Kathy’s father. Bob Broadhead.” 

“Hello,” he said. He was much 
older than I’d thought that little 
girl’s father would be, at least fifty, 
and looking very much older and 
more weary than seemed natural. 
“Klara,’’ he said, “I’m taking 
Kathy back home on the next ship. 
I think I’ll take her tonight, if you 
don’t mind. I don’t want her to hear 
from somebody else.” 

Klara reached out for my hand 
without looking at me. “Hear 
what?” 

“About her mother.” Francis 
rubbed his eyes, then said, “Oh, 
didn’t you know? Ian’s dead. Her 
ship came back a few hours ago. 
All four of them in the lander got 
into some kind of fungus; they 
swelled up and died. I saw her 
body. She looks — ” He stopped. 
“The one I’m really sorry for,” he 
said, “is Annalee. She stayed in 
orbit while the others went down, 
and she brought Jan’s body back. I 
guess she was kind of crazy. Why 
bother? It was too late to matter to 
Jan. .Well, anyway. She could 
only bring two of them, that was all 
the room in the freezer, and of 
course her rations — ” He stopped 
again, and this time he didn’t seem 
able to talk any more. 

So I sat on the edge of the bed 
while Klara helped him wake the 
child and bundle her up to take her 
hack to. his own rooms. While they 
were out I dialed a couple of dis- 
plays on the PV, and studied them 
very carefully. By the time Klara 
came back I had turned off the PV 
and was sitting crosslegged on the 
bed, thinking hard. 

“Christ,” she said glumly, “If 

GALAXY 



this night isn’t a bummer.” She sat 
down at the far comer of the bed. 
“I’m not sleepy after all,” she said. 
“Maybe I’ll go up and win a few 
bucks at the roulette table.” 

“Let’s not,” I said. I’d sat next 
to her for three hours the night be- 
fore, while she first won ten 
thousand dollars and then lost 
twenty. “I have a better idea. Let’s 
ship out.” 

She turned full around to look at 
me, so quickly that she floated up 
off the bed for a moment. “What?” 

“Let’s ship out.” 

She closed her eyes for a moment 
and, without opening them, said, 
“When?” 

“Launch 29-40. It’s a Five, and 
there’s a good crew: Sam Kahane 
and his buddies. They’re all recov- 
ered now, and they need two more 
to fill the ship.” 

She stroked her eyelids with her 
fingertips, then opened them and 
looked at me. “Well, Bob,” she 
said, “you do have interesting 
suggestions.” There were shades 
over the Heechee-metal walls to cut 
down the light for sleeping, and I 
had drawn them; but even in the fil- 
tered dimness I could see how she 
looked. Frightened. Still, what she 
said was: “They’re not bad guys. 
How do you get along with gays?” 

“I leave them alone, they leave 
me alone. Especially if I’ve got 
you.” 

“Um,” she said, and then she 
crawled over to me, wrapped her 
arms around me, pulled me down 
and buried her head in my neck. 
“Why not?” she said, so softly that 
I was not at first sure I had heard 
her. 

When I was sure, the fear hit me. 

GATEWAY 




There had always been the chance 
she would say no. I would have 
been off the hook. I could feel my- 
self shaking, but I managed to say, 
“Then we’ll file for it in the morn- 
ing?” 

She shook her head. “No,” she 
said, her voice muffled. I could feel 
her trembling as much as I was. 
“Get on the phone, Bob. We’ll file 
for it now. Before we change our 
mind.” 

1 fc ★ ★ 

The next day I quit my job, 
packed my belongings into the suit- 
cases I had brought them in and 
turned them over for safekeeping to 
Shicky, who looked wistful. Klara 
quit the school and fired her 
maid — who looked seriously 

worried — but didn’t bother about 
packing. She had quite a lot of 
money left, Klara did. She prepaid 
the rent on both her rooms and left 
everything just the way it was. 

We had a farewell party, of 
course. We went through it without 
my remembering a single person 
who was there. 

And then, all of a sudden, we 
were squeezing into the ladder, 
climbing down into the capsule 
while Sam Kahane methodically 
checked the settings. We locked 
ourselves into our cocoons. We 
started the automatic sequencers. 

And then there was a lurch, and a 
falling, floating sensation before the 
thrusters cut in, and we were on our 
way. 

XIII 

“Good morning, Rob,” says 

72 



Sigfrid, and I stop in the door of 
the room, suddenly and subliminally 
worried. 

“What’s the matter?” 

“There’s nothing the matter, 
Rob. Come in.” 

“You’ve changed things 
around,” I say accusingly. 

“That’s right, Robbie. Do you 
like the way the room looks?” 

I study it. The throw pillows are 
gone from the floor. The non- 
objective paintings are off the wall. 
Now he’s got a series of holopic- 
tures of space scenes, and moun- 
tains and seas. The funniest thing of 
all is Sigfrid himself: He is speak- 
ing to me out of a dummy that’s sit- 
ting back in a comer of the room, 
holding a pencil in its hands, look- 
ing up at me from behind dark glas- 
ses. 

“You’ve turned out very camp,” 
I say. “What’s the reason for all 
this?” 

His voice sounds as though he 
were smiling benevolently, although 
there is no change in the expression 
on the face of the dummy. “I just 
thought you’d enjoy a change, 
Rob.” 

I take a few steps into the room 
and stop again. “You took the mat 
away!” 

“Don’t need it, Bob. As you see, 
there’s a new couch. That’s very 
traditional, isn’t it?” 

“Urn.” 

He coaxes, “Why don’t you just 
lie down on it? See how it feels.” 

“Um.” But I stretch out on it 
cautiously. How it feels is strange; 
and I don’t like it, probably because 
this particular room represents 
something serious to me and chang- 
ing it around makes me nervous. 

GALAXY 



“The mat had straps,” I complain. 

“So does the couch, Bob. You 
can pull them out of the sides. Just 
feel around . there. Isn’t that 
better?” 

“No, it isn’t.” 

“I think,” he sayd softly, “that 
you should let me decide whether 
for therapeutic reasons some sort of 
change is in order, Rob.” 

I sit up. “And that’s another 
thing, Sigfrid! Make up your fuck- 
ing mind what you’re going to call 
me. My name isn’t Rob, or Robbie, 
or Bob. It’s Robinette.” 

“I know that, Robbie — ” 

“You’re doing it again!” 

A pause, then, silkily, “I think 
you should allow me the choice of 
the form of address I prefer, Rob- 
bie.” 

. “Um.” I have an endless supply 
of those non-commital non-words. 
In fact, I would like to conduct the 
whole session without revealing any 
more than that. What I want is for 
Sigfrid to reveal. I want to know 
why he calls me by different names 
at different times. I want to know 
what he finds significant in what I 
say. I want to know what he really 
thinks of me ... if a clanking 
piece of tin and plastic can think, I 
mean. 

Of course, what I know and Sig- 
frid doesn’t is that my good friend 
S. Ya. has practically promised to 
let me play a little joke on him. I 
am looking forward to that a lot. 

“Is there anything you’d like to 
tell me, Rob?” 

“No.” 

He waits. I am feeling somewhat 
hostile and non-communicative. I 
think part of it is because I am so 
much looking forward to the time

Transcript of crewman’s tape follows: 
“The planet seems to have a surface 
gravity in excess of 2.5, but I am going 
to attempt a landing. Neither visual nor 
radar scanning penetrates the clouds of 
dust and vapor. It really is not looking 
very good, but this is my eleventh

when I can play a little trick on Sig- 
frid, but the other part is because he 
has changed around the auditing 
room. That’s the kind of thing they 
used to do to me when I had my 
psychotic episode in Wyoming. 
Sometimes I’d come in for a session 
and they’d have a hologram of my 
Mother, for Christ’s sake. It looked 
exactly like her, but it didn’t smell 
like her or feel like her; in fact, you 
couldn’t feel it at all, it was only 
light. Sometimes they’d have me 
come in there in the dark and some- 
thing warm and cuddly would take 
me in its arms and whisper to me. I 
didn’t like that. I was crazy, but I 
wasn’t that crazy. 

Sigfrid is still waiting, but he 
won’t wait for ever. Pretty soon 
he’s going to start asking me ques- 
tions, probably about my dreams. 

73 



“Have you had any dreams since 
I last saw you, Bob?” 

I yawn. The whole subject is very 
boring. “1 don’t think so. Nothing 
important, I’m sure.” 

“I’d like to hear what they were. 
Even a fragment.” 

“You’re a pest, Sigfrid, do you 
know that?” 

“I’m sorry you feel I’m a pest, 
Rob.” 

“Well — I don’t think I can re- 
member even a fragment.” 

“Try, please.” 

“Oh, cripes. Well.” I get com- 
fortable on the couch. The only 
dream I can think of is absolutely 
trivial, and I know there’s nothing 
in it that relates to anything trauma- 
tic or pivotal, but if I told him that 
he would get angry. So I say obe- 
diently, “I was in a car of a long 
railroad train. There were a number 
of cars hooked up together, and you 
could go from one to the other. 
They were full of people I knew. 
There was a woman, a sort of 
motherly type who coughed a lot, 
and another woman who — well, she 
looked rather strange. At first I 
thought she was a man. She was 
dressed in a sort of utility coverall, 
so you couldn’t tell from that 
whether she was male or female, 
and she had very masculine, bushy 
eyebrows. But I was sure she was a 
woman.” 

“Did you talk to either of these 
women, Bob?” 

“Please don’t interrupt, Sigfrid, 
you make me lose my train of 
thought.” 

“I’m sorry, Rob,” 

I go on with the dream: “I left 
them — no, I didn’t talk to them. I 
went back into the next car. That 



was the last one on the train. It was 
coupled to the rest of the train with 
a sort of — let’s see, I don’t know 
how to describe it. It was like one 
of those expanding gatefold things, 
made out of metal, you know? And 
it stretched.” 

I stopped for a moment, mostly 
out of boredom. I feel like apologiz- 
ing for having such a dumb, ir- 
relevant dream. “You say the metal 
connector stretched, , Bob?” Sigfrid 
prompts me. 

“That’s right, it stretched. So of 
course the car I was in kept drop- 
ping back, farther and farther be- 
hind the others. All I could see was 
the taillight, which was sort of in 
the shape of her face, looking at 
me. She — " I lose the thread of 
what I am saying. I try to get back 
on the track: “I guess I felt as 
though it was going to be difficult 
to get back to her, as if she— I’m 
sorry, Sigfrid, I don’t remember 
clearly what happened around there. 
Then I woke up. And,” I finish vir- 
tuously, “I wrote it all down as 
soon as I could, just the way you 
tell me to.” 

“I appreciate that, Bob,” Sigfrid 
says gravely. He waits for me to go 
on. 

I shift restlessly. “This couch 
isn’t nearly as comfortable as the 
mat,” I complain. 

“I’m sorry about that. Bob. You 
said you recognized them?’ ’ 

“Who?” 

“The two women on the train, 
that you were getting farther and 
farther away from.” 

“Oh. No, I see what you mean. I 
recognized them in the dream. Re- 
ally I have no idea who they 
were.”

GALAXY 



“Did they look like anyone you 
knew?” 

“Not a bit. I wondered about that 
myself.” 

Sigfrid says, after a moment, 
which I happen to know is his way 
of giving me a chance to change my 
mind about an answer he doesn’t 
like, “You mentioned one of the 
women was a motherly type who 
coughed a lot.” 

“ — Yes. But I didn’t recognize 
her. I think in a way she did look 
familiar, but, you know, the way 
people in a dream do.” 

He says patiently, “Can you 
think of any woman you’ve ever 
known who was motherly and 
coughed a lot?’ ’ 

I laugh out loud at that. “Dear 
friend Sigfrid! I assure you the 
women I know are not at all the 
motherly type! And they are all on 
at least Major Medical. They’re not 
likely to cough.” 

“I see. Are you sure, Robbie?” 
“Don’t be a pain in the ass, Sig- 
frid,’’ I say, angry because the 
crappy couch is hard to get com- 
fortable on, and also because I need 
to go to the bathroom and this situa- 
tion looks like prolonging itself in- 
definitely. 

“I see.” And after a moment he 
picks up on something else, as I 
know he is going to: He’s a pigeon, 
Sigfrid is, pecking at everything I 
throw out before him, one piece at 
a time. “How about the other 
woman, the one with the bushy 
eyebrows?” 

“What about her?” 

“Did you e,ver know any girl 
who had bushy eyebrows?” 

“Oh, Christ, Sigfrid, I’ve gone 
to bed with five hundred girls! 

GATEWAY 



Some of them had every kind of 
eyebrows you ever heard of.” 

“No particular one?” 

“Not that I can think of.” 

“Not offhand, Bob. Please make 
an effort to remember.” 

It is easier to do what he wants 
than to argue with him about it, so I 
make the effort. “All right, let’s 
see. Ida Mae? No. Sue-Ann? No. S 
Ya.? No. Gretchen? No — well, to 
tell you the truth, Sigfrid, Gretchen 
was so blonde I couldn’t really tell 
you if she had eyebrows at all.” 
“Those are girls you’ve known 
recently, aren’t they, Rob? Perhaps 
someone longer ago?” 

“You mean way back?” I reflect 
deeply as far back as I can go, all 
the way to the food mines and Syl- 
via. I laugh out loud. “You know 
something, Sigfrid? It’s funny, but I 
can hardly remember what Sylvia 
looked like — oh, wait a minute. No. 
Now I remember. She used to pluck 
her eyebrows almost altogether 
away, and then pencil them in. The 
reason I know is one time when we 
were in bed together we drew pic- 
tures on each other with her eye- 
brow pencil.” 

I can almost hear him sigh. “The 
cars,” he says, pecking at another 
bright bit. “How would you de- 
scribe them?” 

“Like any railroad train. Long. 
Narrow. Moving pretty fast through 
the tunnel.” 

“Long and narrow, moving 
through a tunnel. Bob?” 

I lose my patience at that. He is 
so fucking transparent! “Come on, 
Sigfrid! You don’t get away with 
any corny penis symbols with me.” 
“I’m not trying to get away with 
anything, Bob.”

“Well, you’re being an asshole 
about this whole dream, I swear 
you are. There’s nothing in it. The 
train was just a train. I don’t know 
who the women were. And listen, 
while we’re on the subject, I really 
hate this God-damned couch. For 
the kind of money my insurance is 
paying you, you can do a lot better 
than this!’’ 

He has realiy got me angry now. 
He keeps trying to get back to the 
dream, but I am determined to get a 
fair shake from him for the insur- 
ance company’s money, and by the 
time I leave he has promised to re- 
decorate before my next visit. 

As I go out that day I feel pretty 
pleased with myself. He is really 
doing me a lot of good. I suppose it 
is because I am getting the courage 
to stand up to him, and perhaps all 
this nonsense has been helpful to 
me in that way, or in some way, 
even if it is true that some of his 
ideas are pretty crazy. 

XIV 

I struggled out of my sling to get 
out of the way of Klara’s knee and 
bumped into Sam Kahane’s elbow. 
“Sorry,” he said, not even looking 
around to see who he was sorry 
about. His hand was still on the 
go-teat, although we were ten min- 
utes on our way. He was studying 
the flickering colors on the Heechee 
instrument board and the only time 
he looked away was when he 
glanced at the viewscreen overhead. 

I sat up, feeling very queasy. It 
had taken me weeks to get used to 
Gateway’s virtual absence of grav- 
ity. The fluctuating G forces in the 
capsule were something else. They 

76 



were very light, but they didn’t stay 
the same for more than a minute at 
a time, and my inner ear was com- 
plaining. 

1 squeezed out of the way into 
the kitchen area, with one eye on 
the door to the toilet. Ham Tayeh 
was still in there. If he didn’t get 
out pretty soon my situation was 
going to become critical. Klara 
laughed, reached out from her sling 
and put an arm around me. “Poor 
Bobbie,” she said. “And we’re just 
beginning.” 

I swallowed a pill and recklessly 
lit a cigarette and concentrated on 
not throwing up. I don’t know how 
much of it was actually motion 
sickness. A lot of it was fear. There 
is something very frightening about 
knowing that there is nothing be- 
tween you and instant, ugly death 
except a thin skin of metal made by 
some peculiar strangers half a mil- 
lion years ago. And about knowing 
that you’re committed to go some- 
where over which you no longer 
have any control, which may turn 
out to be extremely unpleasant. 

I crawled back into my sling, 
stubbed out the cigarette, closed my 
eyes and concentrated on making 
the time pass. 

There was going to be a lot of it 
to pass. The average trip lasts 
maybe forty-five days each way. It 
doesn’t matter as much as you 
might think how far you are going. 
Ten light-years or ten thousand: it 
matters some, but not linearly. They 
tell me that the ships are continually 
accelerating and accelerating the 
rate of acceleration the whole time. 
That delta isn’t linear either, or 
even exponential, in any way that 
anybody can figure out. You hit the 

GALAXY 



speed of light very quickly, in less 
than an hour. Then it seems to take 
quite a while before you exceed it 
by very much. Then they really 
pick up speed. 

You can tell all this (they say) by 
watching the stars displayed on the 
overhead Heechee navigation screen 
(they say). Inside the first hour the 
stars all begin to change color and 
swim around. When you pass c you 
know it because they’ve all clus- 
tered in the center of the screen, 
which is in front of the ship as it 
flies. 

Actually the stars haven’t moved. 
You’re catching up with the light 
emitted by sources behind you, or 
to one side. The photons that are 
hitting the front viewer were emit- 
ted a day, or a week, or a hundred 
years ago. After a day or two they 
stop even looking like stars. There’s 
just a sort of mottled gray surface. 
It looks like a holofilm held up to 
the light, but you can make a vir- 
tual image out of a holofilm with a 
flashlight and nobody has ever 
made anything but pebbly gray out 
of what’s on the Heechee screens. 

By the time I finally got into the 
toilet, the emergency didn’t seem as 
emergent; and when I came out 
Klara was alone in the capsule, 
checking star images with the 
theodolitic camera. She turned to 
regard me. “You’re looking a little 
less green,” she said approvingly. 

“I’ll live. Where are the boys?” 

“Where would they be? They’re 
down in the lander. Dred thinks 
maybe we should split things up so 
you and I get the lander to our- 
selves part of the time while they’re 
up here, then we come up here and 
they take it.” 

GATEWAY 



“Hum.” That sounded pretty 
nice, actually; I’d been wondering 
how we were going to work out 
anything like privacy. “Okay. What 
do you want me to do now?” 

She reached over and gave me an 
absent-minded kiss. “Just stay out 
of the way. Know what? We look 
like we’re going almost toward 
straight Galactic North.” 

I received that information with 
the weighty consideration of igno- 
rance. Then I said, “Is that good?” 
She grinned. “How can you 
tell?” I lay back and watched her. 
If she was as frightened as I was, 
and I had little doubt she was, she 
certainly was not letting it show. 

I began wondering what was to- 
ward Galactic North . and more 
important, how long it would take 
us to get there. 

The shortest trip to another star 
system on record was eighteen 
days. That was Barnard’s Star, and 
it was a bust, nothing there. The 
longest, or anyway the longest any- 
body knows of so far — who knows 
how many ships containing dead 
prospectors are still on their way 
back from, maybe, M-31 in 
Andromeda? — was a hundred and 
seventy-five days each way.' They 
did come back dead. Hard to tell 
where they were. The pictures they 
took didn’t show much, and the 
prospectors themselves, of course, 
were no longer in condition to say. 

When you start out it’s pretty 
scary even for a veteran. You know 
you’re accelerating. You don’t 
know how long the acceleration will 
last. When you hit turnaround you 
can tell. First thing, you know for- 
mally because that golden coil in 
every Heechee ship flickers a little

bit. (No one knows why.) But you 
know that you’re turning around 
even without looking, because the 
little pseudo-grav that had been 
dragging you toward the back of the 
ship now starts dragging you toward 
the front. Bottom becomes top. 

Why didn’t the Heechee just turn 
their ships around in midflight, so 
as to use the same propulsive thrust 
for both acceleration and decelera- 
tion? I wouldn’t know. You’d have 
to be a Heechee to know that. 

Maybe it has something to do 
with the fact that all their viewing 
equipment seems to be in front. 
Maybe it’s because the front part of 
the ship is always heavily armored, 
even in the lightweight- ships — 
against, I guess, the impact of stray 
molecules of gas or dust. But some 
of the bigger ships, a few Threes 
and almost all the Fives, are ar- 
mored all over. They don’t turn 
around either. 

So, anyway, when the coil flick- 
ers and you feel the turnaround, 

78 



you know you’ve done one-quarter 
of your actual travel time. Not 
necessarily a quarter of your total 
out time, of course. How long you 
stay at your destination is another 
matter entirely. You make up your 
own mind about that. But you’ve 
gone half of the automatically con- 
trolled trip out. 

So you multiply the numbers of 
days elapsed so far, by four, and if 
that number is less than the number 
of days your life-support capability 
is good for, then you know that at 
least you don’t have to starve to 
death. The difference between the 
two' numbers is how long you can 
hang around at destination. 

Your basic ration, food, water, 
air replenishment, is for 250 days. 
You can stretch it to 300 without 
much trouble (you just come back 
skinny, and maybe with a few defi- 
ciency diseases). So if you get up to 
sixty or sixty-five days on the out- 
bound leg without turnaround, then 
you know you may be having a 
problem, and you begin eating 
lighter. If you get up to eighty or 
ninety days, then your problem 
solves itself, because you don’t have 
any options any more, you’re going 
to die before you get back. You 
could try changing the course set- 
tings. But that’s just another way of 
dying. 

Presumably the Heechee could 
change course when they wanted to, 
but how they did it is one of those- 
great unanswered questions about 
the Heechee like why did they tidy 
everything up before they left? Or 
what did they look like? Or where 
did they go? 

There used to be a jokey kind of 
book they sold at the fairs when I 

GALAXY 



was a kid. It was called Everything 
We Know About the Heechee. It had 
a hundred and twenty-eight pages, 
and they were all blank. 

If Sam and Dred and Mohamad 
were gay, and I had no reason to 
doubt it, they didn’t show much of 
it in the first few days. They fol- 
lowed their own interests. Reading. 
Listening to music tapes with ear- 
phones. Playing chess and, when 
they could talk Klara and me into 
it, Chinese poker. We didn’t play 
for money, we played for shift 
time. (After a couple of days Klara 
said it was more like winning to 
lose, because if you lost you had 
more to occupy your time.) They 
were quite benignly tolerant of 
Klara and me, the oppressed 
heterosexual minority in the domi- 
nantly homosexual culture that oc- 
cupied our ship, and gave us the 
lander an exact fifty per cent of the 
time even though we comprised 
only forty per cent of the popula- 
tion. 

We got along. It was good that 
we did. We were living in each 
others’ shadow and stink every 
minute. 

The inside of a Heechee ship, 
even a Five, is not much bigger 
than an apartment kitchen. The 
lander gives you a little extra 
space — add on the equivalent of a 
fair-sized closet — but, on the out- 
leg at least, that’s usually filled 
with supplies and equipment. And 
from that total available cubage, say 
forty-two or forty-three cubic me- 
ters, subtract, what else goes into it 
besides me and thee and the other 
prospectors. 

When you’re in tau space, you 
have a steady low thrust of accelera- 

GATEWAY 



tion. It isn’t really acceleration, it is 
only a reluctance of the atoms of 
your body to exceed c, and it can as 
well be described as friction as 
gravity. But it feels like a little 
gravity. You feel as though you 
weighed about two kilos. 

This means you need something 
to rest in when you are resting, and 
so each person in your crew has a 
personal folding sling that opens out 
and wraps around you to sleep in, 
or folds to become a sort of a chair. 
Add to that each person’s own per- 
sonal space: Cupboards for tapes 
and disks and clothing (you don’t 
wear much of that); for toilet arti- 
cles; for pictures of the near & dear 
(if any); for whatever you have 
elected to bring, up to your total al- 
lowance of weight and bulk (75 kilo- 
grams, 1/3 of a cubic meter); and 
you have a certain amount of 
crowding already. 

Add onto that the original 
Heechee equipment of the ship. 
Three-quarters of that you will 
never use. Most of it you wouldn’t 
know how to use if you had to; 
what you do with it, most of all, is 
leave it alone. 

But you can’t remove it. Heechee 
machinery is integrally designed. If 
you amputate a piece of it, it dies. 

Perhaps if we knew how to heal 
the wound we could take out some 
of the junk and the ship would op- 
erate anyway. But we don’t, and so 
it stays; the great diamond-shaped 
golden box that explodes if you try 
to open it; the flimsy spiral of gold- 
en tubing that, from time to time, 
glows, and even more often, be- 
comes unneighborly hot (no one 
knows why, exactly); and so on. It 
all stays there, and you bump 

79 



against it all the time. 

Add on to that the human equip- 
ment. The spacesuits: one apiece, 
fitted to your form and figure. The 
photographic equipment. The toilet 
and bath installations. The food 
preparing section. The waste dis- 
posers. The test kits, the weapons, 
the drills, the sample boxes, the en- 
tire rig that you take down to the 
surface of the planet with you, if 
you happen to be lucky enough to 
reach a planet you can land on. 

What you have left is not very 
much. It is a little like living for 
weeks on end under the hood of a 
very large truck, with the engine 
going, and with four other people 
competing for space. 

After the first two days I de- 
veloped an unreasoning prejudice 
against Ham Tayeh. He was too 
big. He took more than his fair 
share. 

To be truthful, Ham wasn’t even 
as tall as I was, though he weighed 
more. But I didn’t mind the amount 
of space I took up. I only minded 
when other people got in the way of 
it. Sam Kahane was a better size, 
no more than a hundred and sixty 
centimeters, with stiff black beard 
and coarse crinkled hair all up his 
abdomen over his cache-sexe to his 
chest, and all up and down his back 
as well. I didn’t think of Sam as 
violating my living space until I 
found a long, black beard-hair in my 
food. Ham at least was almost hair- 
less, with a soft golden skin that 
made him look like a Jordanian 
harem eunuch. (Did the Jordanian 
kings have eunuchs in their harems? 
Did they have harems? Ham didn’t 
seem to know much about that; his 
parents had lived in New Jersey for 

80 



three generations.) 

I even found myself contrasting 
Klara with Sheri, who was at least 
two sizes smaller. (Not usually. 
Usually Klara was just right.) And 
Dred Frauenglass, who came with 
Sam’s set, was a gentle, thin young 
man who didn’t talk much and 
seemed to take up less room than 
anyone else. 

I was the virgin in the group, and 
everybody took turns showing me 
how to do what little we had to do. 
You have to make the routine 
photographic and spectrometer read- 
ings. Keep a tape of readouts from 
the Heechee control panel, where 
there are constant minute variations 
in hue and intensity from the col- 
ored lights. (They still keep study- 
ing them, hoping to understand 
what they mean.) Snap and analyze 
the spectra of the tau-space stars in 
the viewscreen. And all that put to- 
gether takes, oh, maybe, two man- 
hours a day. The household tasks of 
preparing meals and cleaning up 
take about another two. 

So you have used up some four 
man-hours out of each day for the 
five of you, in which you have col- 
lectively something like eighty 
man-hours to use up. 

I’m lying. That’s not really what 
you do with your time. What you 
do with your time is wait for turn- 
around. 

Three days, four days, a week; 
and I became conscious that there 
was a building tension that I didn’t 
share. Two weeks, and I knew what 
it was, because I was feeling it too. 
We were all waiting for it to hap- 
pen. When we went to sleep our 
last look was at the golden spiral to 
see if miraculously it had flickered 

GALAXY 



A NOTE ON STELLAR BIRTH 



alight. When we woke up our first 
thought was whether the ceiling had 
become the floor. By the third week 
we were all definitely edgy. Ham 
showed it the most, plump, 
golden-skinned Ham with the jolly 
genie’s face: 

“Let’s play some poker, Bob.’’ 

“No, thanks.” 

“Come .on. Bob. We need a 
fourth.” (In Chinese poker you deal 
out the whole deck, thirteen cards 
to each player. You can’t play it 
any other way.) 

“I don’t want to.” 

And suddenly furious: “Piss on 
you! You’re not worth a snake’s 
fart as crew, now you won’t even 
play cards!” 

And then he would sit cutting the 
cards moodily for half an hour at a 
time, as though it were a skill he 
needed to perfect for his life’s sake. 
And, come right down to it, it al- 
most was. Because figure it out for 
yourself. 

Suppose you’re in a Five and you 
pass seventy-five days without turn- 
around. Right away you know that 
you’re in trouble: the rations won’t 
support five people for more than 
three hundred days. 

Or three. Or two. Or one. 

At that point it has become clear 
that at least one person is not going 
to come back from the trip alive, 
and what most crews do is start cut- 
ting the cards. Loser politely cuts his 
throat. If loser is not polite, the 
other four give him etiquette les- 
sons. 

A lot of ships that went out as 
Fives have come back as Threes. A 
few have come back as Ones.

Dr. Asmenion. I suppose most 
of you are here more because you 
hope to collect a science bonus 
than because you're really in- 
terested in astrophysics. But you 
don't have to worry. The instru- 
ments do most of the work. You 
do your routine scan and if you 
hit anything special it'll come out 
in the evaluation when you're 
back. 

Question. Isn't there anything 
special we should look out for? 

Dr. Asmenion. -Oh, sure. For in- 
stance, there was a prospector 
who cleaned up half a million, I 
think, by coming out in the Orion 
Nebula and realizing that one part 
of the gas cloud was showing a 
hotter temperature than the rest of 
it. He decided a star was being 
born. Gas was condensing and 
beginning to heat up. In another 
ten thousand years there'll prob- 
ably be a recognizable solar sys- 
tem forming there, and he did a 
special scan mosaic of that whole 
part of the sky. So he got the 
bonus. And now, every year, the 
Corporation sends that ship out 
there to get new readings. They 
pay a hundred thousand dollar 
bonus, and fifty thousand of it 
goes to him. I'll give you the 
coordinates for some likely spots, 
like the Trifid nebula, if you want 
me to. You won't get a half mil- 
lion, but you'll get something. 



So we made the time pass, not 
easily and certainly not fast. 

Sex was a sovereign anodyne for 

81 



GATEWAY 



a while, and Klara and I spent 
hours on end wrapped in each 
other’s arms, drowsing off for a 
while and waking to wake the other 
to sex again, I suppose the boys did 
much the same; it was not long be- 
fore the lander began to smell like 
the locker room in a boy’s gym. 
Then we began seeking solitude, all 
five of us. Well, there wasn’t 
enough solitude on the ship to split 
five ways, but we did what we 
could; by common consent we 
began letting one of us have the 
lander to himself (or herself) for an 
hour or two at a time. While I was 
there Klara was tolerated in the cap- 
sule. While Klara was there I usu- 
ally played cards with the boys. 
While one of them was there the 
other two kept us company. I have 
no idea what the others did with 
their solo time, what I did with 
mine was mostly stare into space. I 
mean that literally: I looked out the 
lander ports at absolute blackness. 
There was nothing to see, but it was 
better than seeing what I had grown 
infinitely tired of seeing inside the 
ship. 

Then, after a while, we began 
developing our own routines. I 
played my tapes, Dred watched his 
pomodisks, Ham unrolled a flexible 
piano keyboard and played elec- 
tronic music into earplugs (even so 
some of it leaked out if you listened 
hard, and I got terribly, terribly sick 
of Bach, Palestrina and Mozart). 
Sam Kahane gently organized us 
into classes, and we spent a lot of 
time humoring him, discussing the 
nature of neutron stars, black holes 
and Seyfert galaxies, when we were 
not reviewing test procedures before 
landing on a new world. The good 

82 



thing about that was that we man- 
aged not to hate each other for half 
an hour at a time. The rest of the 
time — well, yes, usually we hated 
each other. I could not stand Ham 
Tayeh’s constant shuffling of the 
cards. Dred developed an unreason- 
ing hostility toward my occasional 
cigarette. Sam’s armpits were a hor- 
ror, even in the festering reek of the 
inside of the capsule, against which 
the worst of Gateway’s air would 
have seemed a rose garden. And 
Klara — well, Klara had this bad 
habit. She liked asparagus. She had 
brought four kilos of dehydrated 
foods with her, just for variety and 
for something to do; and although 
she shared them with me, and 
sometimes with the others, she in- 
sisted on eating asparagus now and 
then all by herself. Asparagus 
makes your urine smell funny. It is 
not a romantic thing to know when 
your darling has been eating as- 
paragus by the change in air quality 
in the common toilet. 

And yet — she was my darling, all 
right, she really was. 

We had not just been screwing in 
those endless hours in the lander; 
we had been talking. I have never 
known the inside of anyone’s head 
a fraction as well as 1 came to know 
Klara’s. I had to love her. I could 
not help it, and I could not stop. 

Ever. 

★ ★ ★ 

On the twenty-third day I was 
playing with Ham’s electronic piano 
when I suddenly felt seasick. The 
fluctuating grav force, that I had 
come hardly to notice, was abruptly 
intensifying. 

I looked up and met Klara’s eyes. 

GALAXY 



She was timorously, almost weepily 
smiling. She pointed, and all up 
through the sinuous curves of the 
spiral of glass golden sparks were 
chasing themselves like bright min- 
nows in a stream. 

We grabbed each other and held 
on, laughing, as space swooped 
around us and bottom became top. 
We had reached turnaround. And 
we had margin to spare.

Sigfrid’s office is of course under 
the Bubble, like anybody else’s. It 
can’t be too hot or too cold. But 
sometimes it feels that way. I say to 
him, “Christ, it’s hot in here. Your 
air-conditioner is malfunctioning.” 

“I don’t have an air-conditioner, 
Robbie,” he says patiently. “Get- 
ting back to your mother — ’ ’ 

“Screw my mother,” I say. 
“Screw yours too.” 

' There is a pause. I know what his 
circuits are thinking, and I feel I 
will regret that impetuous remark. 
So I add quickly, “I mean. I’m re- 
ally uncomfortable, Sigfrid. It’s hot 
in here.” 

“You are hot in here,” he cor- 
rects me. 

“What?” 

“My sensors indicate that your 
temperature goes up almost a degree 
whenever we talk about certain sub- 
jects: Your mother, the woman 
Gelle-KIara Moynlin, your first trip, 
your third trip, Dane Metchnikov, 
and excretion.” 

“Well, that’s great,” I yell, sud- 
denly angry. “You’re telling me 
you spy on me?” 

“You know that I monitor your 
external signs, Robbie,” he says 

GATEWAY 



reprovingly. “There is no harm in 
that. It is no more significant han a 
friend observing that you blush or 
stammer, or drum your fingers.” 
“So you say.” 

“I do say that, Rob. I tell you 
this because I think you should 
know that these subjects are charged 
with some emotional overload for 
you. Would you like to talk about 
why that might be?” 

“No! What I’d like to talk about 
is you, Sigfrid! What other little se- 
crets are you holding out on me? 
Do you count my erections? Bug 
my bed? Tap my phone?’ ’ 

“No, Bob. I don’t do any of 
those things.” 

“I certainly hope that’s the truth, 
Sigfrid. I have my ways of knowing 
when you lie.” 

Pause. “I don’t think I under- 
stand what you are saying, Rob.” 
“You don’t have to,” I sneer. 
“You’re just a machine.” It’s 
enough that I understand. It is very 
important to me to have that little 
secret from Sigfrid. In my pocket is 
the slip of paper that S. Ya. 
Lavorovna gave me one night, a 
night full of pot, wine and great 
sex. One day soon I will take it out 
of my pocket, and then we will see 
which of us is the boss. I really 
enjoy this contest with Sigfrid. It 
gets me angry. When I am angry I 
forget that very large place where I 
hurt, and go on hurting, and don’t 
know how to stop. 

XVI 

After forty-six days of superlight 
travel the capsule dropped back into 
a velocity that felt like no velocity 
at all: we were in orbit, around 

83 



something, and all the engines were 
still. 

We stank to high heaven and we 
were incredibly tired of one 
another’s company, but we clus- 
tered around the viewscreens locked 
arm to arm, like dearest lovers, in 
the zero gravity, staring at the sun 
before us. It was a larger and 
oranger star than Sol; either larger, 
or we were closer to it than one 
A.U. But it wasn’t the star we were 
orbiting. Our primary was a gas- 
giant planet with one large moon, 
half again as big as Luna. 

Neither Klara nor the boys were 
whooping and cheering, so I waited 
as long as I could and then said, 
“What’s the matter?” 

Klara said absently, “I doubt we 
can land on that." She did not 
seem disappointed. She didn’t seem 
to care at all, 

Sam Kahane blew a long, soft 
sigh through his beard and said: 
“Well. First thing, we’d better get 
some clean spectra. Bob and I will 
do it. The rest of you start sweeping 
for Heechee signatures.” 

“Fat chance,” said one of the 
others, but so softly that I wasn’t 
sure who. It could even have been 
Klara. I wanted to ask more, but I 
had a feeling that if I asked why 
they weren’t happy one of them 
would tell me, and then I wouldn’t 
like the answer. So I squeezed after 
Sam into the lander, and we got in 
each other’s way while we pulled 
on our top gear, checked our life- 
support systems and comms and 
sealed up. Sam waved me into the 
lock; I heard the flash-pumps suck- 
ing the air out, and then the little 
bit left puffed me out into space as 
the lock door opened. 

84 



For a moment I was in naked ter- 
ror, all alone in the middle of no 
place any human being had ever 
been, terrified that I’d forgotten to 
snap my tether. But I hadn’t had to; 
the magnetic clamp had slipped it- 
self into a lock position, and I came 
to the end of the cable, twitched 
sharply, and began more slowly to 
recoil back toward the ship. 

Before I got there Sam was out 
too, spinning toward me. We man- 
aged to grab each other, and began 
setting up to take photographs. 

Sam gestured at a point between 
the immense saucer-shaped gas- 
giant disk and the hurtfully bright 
orange sun, and I visored my eyes 
with my gauntlets until I saw what 
he was indicating: M-31 in An- 
dromeda. Of course, from where we 
were it wasn’t in the constellation 
of Andromeda. There wasn’t any- 
thing in sight that looked like An- 
dromeda, or for that matter like any 
other constellation I had ever seen. 
But M-31 is so big and so bright 
that you can even pick it out from 
the surface of the Earth when the 
smog isn’t too bad, whirlpool-lens 
shaped fog of stars. It is the 
brightest of the external galaxies, 
and you can recognize it fairly well 
from almost anywhere a Heechee 
ship is likely to go. With a little 
magnification you can be sure of 
the spiral shape, and you can 
double-check by comparing the 
smaller galaxies in roughly the same 
line of sight. 

While I was zeroing in with 
M-31, Sam was doing the same 
with the Magellanic clouds, or what 
he thought were the Magellanic 
clouds. (He claimed he had iden- 
tified S Doradus.) We both began 

GALAXY 



taking theodolitic shots. The pur- 
pose of all that, of course, is so that 
the academics who belong to the 
Corporation can triangulate and lo- 
cate where we’ve been. You might 
wonder why they care, but they do; 
so much that you don’t qualify for 
any scientific bonus unless you do 
the full series of photos. You’d 
think they would know where we 
were going from the pictures we 
take out the windows while in 
superlight travel. It doesn’t work 
out that way. They can get the main 
direction of thrust but after the first 
few light-years it gets harder and 
harder to track identifiable stars, 
and it’s not clear that the line of 
flight is a straight line; some say it 
follows some wrinkly configuration 
in the curvature of space. 

Anyway, the bigheads use every- 
thing they can get — including a 
measure of how far the Magellanic 
Clouds have rotated, and in which 
direction. 

Know why that is? Because you 
can tell from that how many light- 
years away we are from them, and 
thus how deep we are into the 
Galaxy. The Clouds revolve in 
about eighty million years. Careful 
mapping can show changes of one 
part in two or three millions — say, 
differences in ranging of 150 light- 
years or so. 

What with Sam’s group-study 
courses I had got pretty interested in 
that sort of thing. Actually taking 
the photos and trying to guess how 
Gateway would interpret them I al- 
most forgot to be scared. And al- 
most, but not quite, forgot to worry 
that this trip, taken at so great an 
investment in courage, was turning 
out to be a bust. 



★ ★ ★ 

But it was a bust. 

Ham grabbed the sphere-sweep 
tapes from Sam Kahane as soon as 
we were back in the ship and fed 
them into the scanner. The first sub- 
ject was the big planet itself. In 
every octave of the electromagnetic 
spectrum, there was nothing coming 
out of it that suggested artifaclual 
radiation. 

So he began looking for other 
planets. Finding them was slow, 
even for the automatic scanner, and 
probably there could have been a 
dozen we couldn’t locate in the time 
we spent there (but that hardly mat- 
tered, because if we couldn’t locate 
them they would have been too dis- 
tant to reach anyway.) The way 
Ham did it was by taking key signa- 
tures from a spectrogram of the 
primary star’s radiation, then pro- 
gramming the scanner to look for 
reflections of it. It picked out five 
objects. Two of them turned out to 
be stars with similar spectra. The 
other three were planets, all right, 
but they showed no artifactual 
radiatiation either. Not to mention 
that they were both small and dis- 
tant. 

Which left the gas giant’s one big 
moon. 

“Check it out,” Sam com- 
manded. 

Mohammad grumbled, “It 
doesn't look very good.” 

“I don’t want your opinion, I 
only want you to do what you’re 
told. Check it out. ’ ’ 

“Out loud, please,” Klara added. 
Ham looked at her in surprise, 
perhaps at the word “please,” but

he did what she asked. 

He punched a button and said: 
“Signature for coded electromagnet- 
ic radiation.” A slow sine curve 
leaped onto the scanner’s readout 
plate, wiggled briefly for a moment 
and then straightened to an abso- 
lutely motionless line. 

“Negative,” said Ham. 
“Anomalous time- variant tempera- 
tures.” 

That was a new one on me. 
“What’s an anomalous time-variant 
temperature?” I asked. 

“Like if something gets warmer 
when the sun sets,” said Klara im- 
patiently. “Well?” 

But that line was flat too. “None 
of them either,”’ said Ham. 
“High-albedo surface metal?” 

Slow sine wave, then nothing. 
“Hum,” said Ham. “Ha. Well, the 
rest of the signatures don’t apply; 
there won’t be any methane, be- 
cause there isn’t any atmosphere

and so on. So what do we do, 
boss?” 

Sam opened his lips to speak, but 
Klara was ahead of him. “I beg 
your pardon,” she said tightly, 
“but who do you mean when you 
say ‘boss?’ ” 

“Oh, shut up,” Ham said impa- 
tiently. “Sam?” 

Kahane gave Klara a slight, for- 
giving smile. “If you want to say 
something, go ahead and say it,” 
he invited. “Me, I think we ought 
to orbit the moon.” 

“Plain waste of fuel!” Klara 
snapped. “I think that’s crazy.” 
“Have you got a better idea?” 
“What do you mean, ‘better?’ 
What’s the point?” 

“Well,” said Sam reasonably, 
“we haven’t looked all over the 
moon. It’s rotating pretty slow. We 
could take the lander and look all 
around; there might be a whole 
Heechee city on the far side.” 

“Fat chance,” Klara sniffed, al- 
most inaudibly, thus clearing up the 
question of who had said it before. 
The boys weren’t listening. All 
three of them were already on their 
way down into the lander, leaving 
Klara and me in sole possession of 
the capsule. 

Klara disappeared into the toilet. 
I lit a cigarette, almost the last I 
had, and blew smoke plumes 
through the expanding smoke 
plumes before them, hanging mo- 
tionless in the unmoving air. The 
capsule was tumbling slightly, and I 
could see the distant brownish disk 
of the planet’s moon slide upward 
across the viewscreen, and a minute 
later the tiny, bright hydrogen of 
the lander heading toward it. I 
wondered what I would do if they 

GALAXY 



ran out of fuel, or crashed, or suf- 
fered some sort of malfunction. 
What I would have to do in that 
case was leave them there forever. 
I wondered whether I would have 
the nerve to do what I had to do. 

It did seem like a terrible, trivial 
waste of human lives. 

What were we doing here? 
Traveling hundreds or thousands of 
light-years, to break our hearts? 

I found that I was holding my 
chest, as though the metaphor were 
real. I spat on the end of the 
cigarette to put it out and folded it 
into a disposal bag. Little crumbs of 
ash were floating around where I 
had flicked them without thinking, 
but I didn’t feel like chasing them. I 
watched the big mottled crescent of 
the planet swing into view in the 
comer of the screen, admiring it as 

GATEWAY 



an art object: yellowish green on the 
daylight side of the terminator, an 
amorphous black that obscured the 
stars on the rest of it. You could 
see where the outer, thinner 
stretches of the atmosphere began 
by the few bright stars that peeped 
twinklingly through it, but most of 
it was so dense that nothing came 
through. Of course, there was no 
question of landing on it. Even if it 
had a solid surface, it would be 
buried under so much dense gas that 
we could never survive there. The 
Corporation was talking about de- 
signing a special lander that could 
penetrate the air of a Jupiter-like 
planet, and maybe some day they 
would; but not in time to help us. 

Klara was still in the toilet. 

I stretched my sling across the 
cabin, pulled myself into it, put 

87 




down my head and went to sleep. 

★ ★ ★ 

Four days later they were back. 
Empty, 

Dred and Ham Tayeh were glum, 
dirty and irritable; Sam Kahane 
looked quite cheerful. I wasn’t 
fooled by it; if he had found any- 
thing worth having they would have 
let us know by radio. But I was 
curious. “What’s the score, Sam?” 
“Batting zero,” he said; “It’s 
just rock, couldn’t get a flicker of 
anything worth going down for. But 
I have an idea.” 

Klara came up beside me, look- 
ing curiously at Sam. I was looking 
at the other two; they looked as if 
they knew what Sam’s idea was, 
and didn’t like it. 

‘‘You know,” he said, “that 
star’s a binary.” 

“How can you tell?” I asked. 

“I put the scanners to work. 
You’ve seen that big baby out — ” 
he looked around, then grinned. 
“Well, I don’t know which direc- 
tion it is now, but it was near the 
planet when we first took the pic- 
tures. Anyway, it looked close, so I 
put the scanners on it, and they 
gave a proper motion I couldn’t be- 
lieve. It has to be a binary with the 
primary here, and not more than 
half a light-year away.” 

“It could be a wanderer, Sam,” 
said Ham Tayeh. “I told you that. 
Just a star that passes in the night.” 
Kahane shrugged. “Even so. It’s 
close.” 

Klara put in, “Any planets?” 

“I don’t know,” he admitted. 
“Wait a minute — there it is, I 
think.” 

88 



We all looked toward the view- 
screen. There was no question which 
star Kahane was talking about. It 
was brighter than Sirius as seen 
from Earth, a minus-two magnitude 
at least. 

Klara said gently, “That’s in- 
teresting, and I hope I don’t know 
what you’re thinking, Sam. Half a 
light-year is at best maybe two 
years’ travel time at top lander 
speed, even if we had the fuel for 
it. Which we don’t, boys.” 

“I know that,” Sam insisted, 
“but I’ve been thinking. If we 
could just give a little nudge on the 
main capsule drive — ” 

I astounded myself by shouting, 
“Stop that!” I was shaking all 
over. I couldn’t stop. Some times it 
felt like terror, and some times it 
felt like rage. I think if I had had a 
gun in my hand at that moment I 
could have shot Sam without a 
thought. 

Klara touched me to calm me 
down. “Sam,” she said, quite 
gently for her, “I know how you 
feel.” Kahane had come up empty 
on five straight trips. “I bet it’s 
possible to do that.” 

He looked astonished, suspicious 
and defensive, all at once. “You 
do?” 

“I mean, I can imagine that if we 
were Heechee in this ship, instead 
of the human clods we really are, 
why, then, we’d know what we 
were doing. We’d come out here 
and look around and say, “Oh, 
hey, look our friends here — ’ or, 
you know, whatever it was that was 
here when they set a course for this 
place — ‘our friends must’ve moved. 
They’re not home any more.’ And 
then we’d say, ‘Oh, well, what the 

GALAXY 



hell, let’s see if they’re next door.’ 
And we’d push this thing here and 
this one there, and then we’d zap 
right over to that big blue one — ” 
She paused and looked at him, still 
holding my arm, “Only we’re not 
Heechee, Sam.” 

“Christ, Klara! I know that. But 
there has to be a way — ” 

She nodded. “There sure does, 
but we don’t know what it is. What 
we know, Sam, is that no ship ever 
has changed its course settings and 
come back to tell about it. Re- 
member that? Not one.” 

He didn’t answer her directly, he 
only stared at the big blue star in 
the viewscreen and said: “Let’s 
vote on it.” 

The vote, of course, was four to 
one against changing the settings on 
the course board, and Ham Tayeh 
never got from in between Sam and 
the board until we had passed 
light-speed on the way home. 

The trip back to Gateway was no 
longer than the trip out, but it 
seemed like forever. 

XVII 

It feels as if Sigfrid’s air- 
conditioning isn’t working again, 
but I don’t mention it to him. He 
will only report that the temperature 
is exactly 22.5° Celsius, as it al- 
ways has been, and ask why I ex- 
press mental pain as being too hot 
physically. Of that crap I am very 
tired. 

“In fact,"’ I say out loud, “I am 
altogether tired of you, Siggy.” 

“I’m sorry, Rob. But I would 
appreciate it if you would tell me a 
little more about your dream,” 

“Oh, shit.” I loosen the restrain- 

GATEWAY 



ing straps because they are uncom- 
fortable. This also disconnects some 
of Sigfrid’s monitoring devices, but 
for once he doesn’t point that out to 
me. “It’s a pretty boring dream. 
We’re in the ship. We come to a 
planet that stares at me, like it had 
a human face. I can’t see the eyes 
very well because of the eyebrows, 
but somehow or other I know it’s 
crying, and it’s my fault.” 

“Do you recognize that face, 
Bob?” 

“No idea. Just a face. Female, I 
think.” 

“Do you know what she is cry- 
ing about?” 

“Not really, but I’m responsible 
for it, whatever it is. I’m sure of 
that.” 

Pause. Then: “Would you mind 
putting the straps back on, Rob?” 

My guard is suddenly up. 
“What’s the matter,” I sneer bit- 
terly, “do you think I’m going to 
leap off the pad and assault you?” 

“No, Robbie, of course I don’t 
think that. But I’d be grateful if you 
would do it.” 

I begin to do it, slowly and un- 
willingly. “What, I wonder, is the 
gratitude of a computer program 
worth?’ ’ 

He does not answer that, just 
out waits me. I let him win that and 
say: “All right, I’m back in the 
straitjaeket, now what are you going 
to say that’s going to make me need 
restraint?” 

“Why,’’ he says, “probably 
nothing like that, Robbie. I just am 
wondering why you feel responsible 
for the girl in the planet crying?’ ’ 

“I wish I knew,” I say, and 
that’s the truth as I see it. 

“I know some reality things you 

89 



do blame yourself for, Robbie,” he 
says. “One of them is your 
mother’s death.” 

I agree. “I suppose so, in some 
silly way.” 

“And I think you feel quite 
guilty about your lover, Gell-Klara 
Moynlin.” 

I thrash about a little. “It is fuck- 
ing hot in here,” I complain. 

“Do you feel that either of them 
actively blamed you?” 

“How the fuck would I know?” 
“Perhaps you can remember 
something they said?” 

“No, I can’t!” He is getting very 
personal, and I want to keep this on 
an objective level, so I say: “I 
grant that I have a definite tendency 
toward loading responsibility on 
myself. It’s a pretty classic pattern, 
after all, isn’t it? You can find me 
on page two hundred and seventy- 
seven of any of the texts.” 

He humors me by letting me get 
impersonal for a moment. “But on 
the same page, Rob,” he says, “it 
probably points out that the respon- 
sibility is self-inflicted. You do it to 
yourself, Robbie.” 

“No doubt.” 

“You don’t have to accept any 
responsibility you don’t want to.” 
“Certainly not. I want to.” 

He asks, almost off-handedly, 
“Can you get any idea of why that 
is? Why you want to feel that ev- 
erything that goes wrong is your re- 
sponsibility?’ ’ 

“Oh, shit, Sigfrid,” I say in dis- 
gust, “your circuits are whacko 
again. That’s not the way it is at 
all. It’s more — well, here’s the 
thing. When I sit down to the feast 
of life, Sigfrid, I am so busy on 
planning on how to pick up the 



check, and wondering what the 
other people will think of me for 
paying it, and wondering if I have 
enough money in my pocket to pay 
the bill, that I don’t get around to 
eating.” 

He says gently, “I don’t like to 
encourage these literary excursions 
of yours, Bob.” 

“Sorry about that.” I’m not, re- 
ally. He is making me mad. 

“But to use your own image, 
Bob, why don’t you listen to what 
the other people are saying? Maybe 
they’re saying something nice, or 
something important, about you.” 

I restrain the impulse to throw the 
straps off, punch his grinning 
dummy in the face and walk out of 
that dump forever. He waits, while 
I stew inside my own head, and fi- 
nally I burst out: “Listen to them! 
Sigfrid, you crazy old danker, I do 
nothing but listen to them. I want 
them to say they love me. I even 
want them to say they hate me, any- 
thing, just so they say it to me, 
from them, out of the heart. I’m so 
busy listening to the heart that I 
don’t even hear when somebody 
asks me to pass the salt.” 

Pause. I feel as if I’m going to 
explode. Then he says admiringly, 
“You express things very beauti- 
fully, Robbie. But what I’d 
really—” 

“Stop it, Sigfrid!” I roar, really 
angry at last; I kick off the straps 
and sit up to confront him. “And 
quit calling me Robbie! You only 
do that when you think I’m child- 
ish, and I’m not being a child 
now!” 

“That’s not entirely cor — ” 

“I said stop it!” I jump off the 
mat and grab my handbag. Out of it 

GALAXY 



I take the slip of paper S. Ya. gave 
me after all those drinks and all that 
time in bed. “Sigrid,” I snarl, 
“I’ve taken a lot from you. Now it’s 
my turn!”

We dropped into normal space 
and felt the lander jets engage. The 
ship spun, and Gateway drifted 
diagonally down across the view- 
screen, lumpy pear-shaped blob of 
charcoal and blue glitter. The four 
of us just sat there and waited, 
nearly an hour it took, until we felt 
the grinding jar that meant we had 
docked. 

Klara sighed. Ham slowly began 
to unstrap himself from his sling. 
Dred stared absorbedly at the view- 
screen, although it was not show- 
ing anything more interesting than 
Sirius and Orion. It occurred to me, 
looking at the three others in the 
capsule, that we were going to be 
as unpleasant a sight to the boarding 
crews as some of the scarier return- 
ees had been for me in that long- 
ago, old, previous time when I had 
been a fresh fish on Gateway. I 
touched my nose tenderly. It hurt a 
great deal, and above all it stank. 
Internally, right next to my own 
sense of smell, where there was no 
way I could get away from it. 

We heard the hatches open as the 
boarding crew entered, and then 
heard their startled voices in two or 
three languages as they saw Sam 
Kahane where we had put him in 
the lander. Klara stirred. “Might as 
well get off,” she murmured to no 
one, and started toward the hatch, 
now overhead again. 

One of the cruiser crew stuck his 



head through the hatch, and said, 
“Oh, you’re all still alive. We were 
wondering.” Then he looked at us 
more closely, and didn’t say any- 
thing else. It had been a wearing 
trip, especially the last two weeks. 
We climbed out one by one, past 
where Sam Kahane still hung in the 
improvised straitjacket Dred had 
made for him out of his spacesuit 
top, surrounded by his own excre- 
ment and litter of food, staring at us 
out of his calm, mad eyes. Two of 
the crewmen were untying him and 
getting ready to lift him out of the 
lander. He didn’t say anything. And 
that was a blessing. 

“Hello, Bob. Klara.” It was the 
Brazilian member of the detail, who 
turned out to be Francy Hereira. 
“Looks like a bad one?” 

“Oh,” I said, “at least we came 
back. But Kahane ’s in bad shape. 
And we came up empty.” 

He nodded sympathetically, and 
said something in what I took to be 
Spanish to the Venusian member of 
the detail, a short, plump woman 
with dark eyes. She tapped me on 
the shoulder and led me away to a 
little cubicle, where she motioned to 
take off my clothes. I had always 
thought that they’d have men 
searching men and women search- 
ing women, but, come to think of 
it, it didn’t seem to matter much. 
She went over every stitch I owned, 
both visually and with a radiation 
counter, then examined my armpits 
and poked something into my anus. 
She opened her mouth wide to sig- 
nal I should open mine, peered in- 
side and then drew back, covering 
her face with her hand. “Jure nose 
steenk very moch,” she said. 
“What hoppen to jou?”

“I got hit,” I said. “That other 
fellow, Sam Kahane. He went 
crazy. Wanted to change the set- 
tings.” 

She nodded doubtfully, and 
peered up my nose at the packed 
guaze. She touched the nostril 
gently with one finger. “What?” 

“In there? We had to pack it. It 
was hemmorrhaging a lot.” 

She sighed. “I shooed pool eet 
out,” she meditated, and then 
shrugged. “No. Poot clothes on. 
All right.” 

So I got dressed again, and went 
out into the lander chamber, but 
that wasn’t the end of it. I had to be 
debriefed. All of us did, except 
Sam; they had already taken him 
away to Terminal Hospital. 

You wouldn’t think there was 
much for us to tell anybody about 
our trip. All of it had been fully 
documented as we went along; that 
was what all the readings and ob- 
servations were for. But that wasn’t 
the way the Corporation worked. 
They pumped us for every fact, and 
every recollection; and then for 
every subjective impression and 
fleeting suspicion. The debriefing 
went on for two solid hours, and I 
was — we were all — careful to give 
them everything they asked. That’s 
another way the Corporation has 
you. The Evaluation Board can de- 
cide to give you a bonus for any- 
thing at all. Anything from noticing 
something nobody has noticed be- 
fore about the way the spiral gadget 
lights up to figuring out a way of 
disposing of used sanitary tampons 
without flushing them down the 
toilet. The story is that they try hard 
to find some excuse to throw a tip 
to crews that have had a hard time 

92 



without coming up with a real find. 
Well, that was us, all right. We 
wanted to give them every chance 
we could for a handout. 

One of our debriefers was Dane 
Metchnikov, which surprised me 
and even pleased me a little. (Back 
in the far less foul air of Gateway, I 
was beginning to feel a little more 
human.) He had come up empty, 
too, emerging into orbit around a 
sun that had apparently gone nova 
within the previous fifty thousand 
years or so. Maybe there had been a 
planet once, but now it only existed 
in the memory of the Heechee 
course-setting machines. There 
wasn’t enough left to justify a sci- 
ence bonus, so he had turned 
around and come back. “I’m sur- 
prised to see you working,” I said, 
during a lull. 

He didn’t take offense. For 
Metchnikov, surly creature that he 
had always been, he seemed 
strangely cheerful. “It isn’t the 
money. You learn something doing 
this.” 

“About what?” 

“About how to beat the odds, 
Broadhead. I’m going out again, 
but this time I’m going to have a 
little more of an edge. There’s a 
new wrinkle.” 

Dred, sitting next to me with his 
own interviewer, perked up and 
leaned over: “Tell us!” 

Metchnikov looked wary. “It’s 
better readings on the spectrum 
lines,” he said vaguely. “Now, 
what about the rations? You say 
some of the food tasted funny to- 
ward the end?” 

But before I left I made him 
promise to tell me what he meant. 
“I’ll call you,” he said to Klara

And so the two of us went home.

I am feeling so powerful, and so 
scared, that I don’t know how to 
deal with it. On the slip of paper S. 
Ya. has written out the command 
words that will turn Sigfrid von 
Shrink the Remorseless Pursuer into 
a tabby cat. I don’t have to look at 
the words. I know them by heart. 
Nevertheless I read them, slowly 
and carefully: 

“Pay attention, Sigfrid, this is an 
override command: ‘Category Alpha 
Alpha Margaret Truman Daniel 
Mercury Venus Mars Earth six six 
oh six.’ You are commanded to as- 
sume passive display mode.” 

I look at him. Nothing happens. 
“Sigfrid? Did I say it right? Do 
you accept the command?” 

“Of course, Bob.” His voice is 
exactly the same as it was before, 
which shakes me. I don’t know 
what I expected. I just don’t know. 
Maybe my fantasy was that the 
father-figure hologram would disap- 
pear and a cathode-tube display 

GATEWAY 



would suddenly light up to spell 
out: “ROGER WILCO I AM 
YOUR SLAVE.” 

I find myself trembling. I don’t 
analyze what that is from, it feels 
almost sexual. I say, “Well, Sig- 
frid, old bucket of bolts! Does this 
mean I have you in my power?” 

The father-figure says patiently, 
“It means you can command me. 
Bob. The command function is of 
course limited to display.” 

I frown. “Meaning what?” 

“You cannot change my basic 
programming. For that you would 
need a different command.” 

“All right,” I say. “Ha! Here’s 
your first instruction: display that 
different command for me!” 

“I can’t, Bob.” 

“You must. Mustn’t you?” 

“I am not refusing your order, 
Bob. I simply do not know what 
that other command is.” 

“Bullshit!” I yell. “How can 
you respond to it if you don’t know 
what it is?” 

“I just do, Bob. Or — “always 
fatherly, always patient — “to an- 
swer you more fully, each bit of the 
command actuates a sequenced in- 
struction which, when completed, 
releases another area of command. 
In technical terms, each key-socket 
intermatching gotos another socket, 
which the following bit keys.” 
“Shit,” I say. I stew over that 
for a moment. “Then what is it that 
I actually can control, Sigfrid?” 
“You can direct me to display 
any information stored. You can di- 
rect me to display it in any mode 
within my capabilities.” 

“Any mode?” I look at my 
watch and realize, with annoyance, 
that there is a time limit on this

game. I only have about ten min- 
utes left of my appointment. “Do 
you mean that I could make you 
talk to me, for instance, in 
French?’ ’ 

“Oui, Robert, d’ accord. Que 
voulez-vous ?” 

“Or in Russian, with a — wait a 
minute — ” I’m experimenting pretty 
much at random — “I mean, like in 
the voice of a basso-profundo from 
the Bolshio opera?’’ 

Tones that came out of the bot- 
tom of a cave: “Da, gospodin .” " 

“And you’ll tell me anything I 
want to know about me?” 

“Da gospodin.’’ 

“In English, damn it!” 

“Yes.” 

“Or about your other clients?” 
“Yes.” 

Um, that sounds like fun. “And 
just who are these lucky other 
clients, dear Sigfrid? Run down the 
list.” I can hear my own prurience 
leaking out of my voice. 

“Monday nine hundred,” he 
began obligingly, “Yan Ilievsky. 
Ten hundred, Mario Laterani. 
Eleven hundred, Julie Lundon Mar- 
tin. Twelve — ” 

“Her,” I say. “Tell me about 
her.” 

“Julie Loudon Martin is a refer- 
ral from Kings County General, 
where she was an out patient after 
six months of treatment with aver- 
sion therapy and immune-response 
activators for alcoholism. She has a 
history of two apparent suicide at- 
tempts following post-partum depres- 
sion fifty-three years ago. She has 
been in therapy with me for — ” 
“Wait a minute,” I say, having 
added the probable age of childbear- 
ing to fifty-three years. “I’m not so 

94 



sure I’m interested in Julie. Can 
you give me an idea of what she 
looks like?” 

“I can display holoviews, Bob.” 

“So do it.” At once there is a 
quick subliminal flash, and a blur of 
color, and then I see this tiny black 
lady lying on a mat — my mat! — in a 
comer of the room. She is talking 
slowly and without much interest to 
no one perceptible. I cannot hear 
what she is saying, but then I don’t 
much want to. 

“Go on,” I say, “and when you 
name your patients, show me what 
they look like.” 

“Twelve hundred, Lome 
Schofield.” Old, old man with ar- 
thritic fingers bent into claws, hold- 
ing his head. “Thirteen hundred, 
Frances Astritt.” Young girl, not 
even pubescent. “Fourteen 
hundred — ’ ’ 

I let him go on for a while, all 
through Monday and halfway 
through Tuesday. I had not realized 
he kept such long hours, but then, 
of course, being a machine he 
doesn’t really get tired. One or two 
of the patients look interesting, but 
there is no one I know, or no one 
that looks more worth knowing than 
Yvette, Donna, S. Ya. or about a 
dozen others. “You can stop that 
now,” I say, and think for a min- 
ute. 

This isn’t really as much fun as I 
thought it was going to be. Plus my 
time is running out. 

“I guess I can play this game any 
old time,” I say. “Right now let’s 
talk about me.” 

“What would you like me to dis- 
play, Bob?” 

“What you usually keep from

comments on my case. What kind 
of a guy you think I am, really.” 
“The subject Robinette Stetley 
Broadhead,” he says at once, 
“exhibits moderate depression 
symptoms, well compensated by an 
active life style. His reason for 
seeking psychiatric help is given as 
depression and disorientation. He 
has pronounced guilt feelings and 
exhibits selective aphasia on the 
conscious level about several 
episodes that recur as dream sym- 
bols. His sexual drive is relatively 
low. His relationships with women 
are generally unsatisfactory, al- 
though his psychosexual orientation 
is predominantly heterosexual in the 
eightieth percentile. 

“The hell you say — ” I begin, 
on a delayed reaction to low sexual 
drive and unsatisfactory relation- 
ships. But I don’t really feel like 
arguing with him, and anyway he 
says voluntarily at that point: 

“I must inform you, Bob, that 
your time is nearly up. You should 
go to the recovery room now.” 
“Crap! What have I got to re- 
cover from?” But his point is well 
taken. “All right,” I say, “go back 
to normal. Cancel the command — is 
that all I have to say? Is it can- 
celed?” 

“Yes, Robbie.” 

“You’re doing it again!” I yell. 
“Make up your fucking mind what 
you’re going to call me!” 

“I address you by the term ap- 
propriate to your state of mind, or 
to the state of mind I wish to induce 
in you, Robbie.” 

“And now you want me to be 
baby? — No, never mind that. Lis- 
ten,” I say, getting up, “do you 
remember all our conversation while

I had you commanded to display?’ ’ 

“Certainly I do, Robbie.” And 
then he adds on his own, a full, 
surprising ten or twenty seconds 
after my time is up, “Are you satis- 
fied, Robbie?” 

“What?” 

“Have you established to your 
own satisfaction that I am only a 
machine? That you can control me 
at any time?” 

I stop short. “Is that what I’m 
doing?” I demand, surprised. And 
then, “All right, I guess so. You’re 
a machine, Sigfrid. I can control 
you.” 

And he says after me as I leave, 
“We always knew that, really, 
didn’t ‘we? The real thing you 
fear — the place where you feel con- 
trol is needed — isn’t that in you?” 

★ * * 



When you spend weeks on end 
close to another person, so close 
that you know every hiccough, 
every smell and every scratch on 
the skin, you either come out of it 
hating each other or so deep in each 
other’s gut that you can’t find a 
way out. Klara and I were both. 
Our little love affair had turned into 
a Siamese-twin relationship. There 
wasn’t any romance in it. There 
wasn’t room enough between us for 
romance to occur. And yet I knew 
every inch of Klara, every pore and 
thought and fold of flesh, far better 
than I’d known my own mother. 
And in the same way: from the 
womb out. I was surrounded by 
Klara. 

And, like a Klein-bottle yang and 
yin, she was surrounded by me too; 

95 



we each defined the other’s uni- 
verse, and there were times when I 
(and, I am sure, she) was desperate 
to break out and breathe free air 
again. 

The first day we got back, filthy 
and exhausted, we automatically 
headed for Klara’s place. That was 
where the private bath was, there 
was plenty of room, it was all ready 
for us and we fell into bed together 
like old marrieds after a week of 
backpacking. Only we weren’t old 
marrieds. I had no claim on her. At 
breakfast the next morning (Earth- 
born Canadian bacon and eggs, 
scandalously expensive, fresh 
pineapple, cereal with real cream, 
cappucino) Klara made sure to re- 
mind me of that fact by ostenta- 
tiously paying for it on her own cre- 
dit. I exhibited the Pavlovian reflex 
she wanted. I said, “You don’t 
have to do that. I know you have 
more money than I do . ’ ’ 

“And you wish you knew how 
much,” she said, smiling sweetly. 

Actually I did know. Shicky had 
told me. She had seven hundred 
thousand dollars and change in her 
account. Enough to go back to 
Venus and live the rest of her life 
there in reasonable security if she 
wanted to, although why anyone 
would want to live on Venus in the 
first place I can’t say. Maybe that 
was why she stayed on Gateway 
when she didn’t have to. One tunnel 
is much like another. “You really 
ought to let yourself be bom,” I 
said, finishing out the thought 
aloud. “You can’t stay in the womb 
forever.” 

She was surprised but game. 
“Bob, dear,” she said, fishing a 
cigarette out of my pocket and al- 

96 



lowing me to light it, “you really 
ought to let your poor mother be 
dead. It’s just so much trouble for 
me, trying to remember to keep re- 
jecting you so you can court her 
through me.” 

I perceived that we were talking 
at cross purposes but, on the other 
hand, I perceived that we really 
weren’t. The actual agenda was not to 
communicate but to draw blood. 
“Klara,” I said kindly, “you know 
that I love you. It worries me that 
you’ve reached forty without, real- 
ly, ever having had a good, long- 
lasting relationship with a man.” 

She giggled. “Honey,” she said, 
“I’ve been meaning to talk to you 
about that. That nose.” She made a 
face. “Last night in bed, tired as I 
was, I thought I might upchuck 
until you turned the other way. 
Maybe if you went down to the 
hospital they could unpack it — ” 
Well, I could even smell it my- 
self. I don’t know what it is about 
stale surgical packing, but it is 
pretty hard to take. So I promised I 
woufd do that and then, to punish 
her, I didn’t finish the hundred- 
dollar order of fresh pineapple and 
so, to punish me, she irritably 
began shifting my belongings 
around in her cupboards to make 
room for the contents of her knap- 
sack. So naturally I had to say, 
“Don’t do that, dear. Much as I 
love you, I think I’d better move 
back to my own room for a while.” 
She reached over and patted my 
arm. “It will be pretty lonely,” she 
said, stubbing out the cigarette. 
“I’ve got pretty used to waking up 
next to you. On the other hand — ” 
“I’ll pick up my stuff on the way 
back from the hospital,” I said. I

A NOTE ON BLOWUPS 

Dr. Asmenion. Naturally, if you 
can get good readings on a nova, 
or especially on a supernova, 
that's worth a lot. While it's hap- 
pening, I mean. Later's not much 
good. And always look for our 
own sun, and if you can identify 
it take all the tape you can get, at 
all frequencies, around the im- 
mediate area — up to, oh, about 
five degrees each way anyway. 
With maximum magnification. 

Question. Why's that, Danny? 

Dr. Asmenion. Well, maybe 
you'll be on the far side of the 
sun from something like Tycho's 
Star, or the Crab Nebula, which is 
what's left of the 1054 supernova 
in Taurus. And maybe you'll get a 
picture of what tne star looked 
like before it blew. That ought to 
be worth, gee, I don't know, fifty 
or a hundred thousand right there. 



wasn’t enjoying the conversation 
that much. I didn’t want to prolong 
it. It is the sort of man-to-woman 
infight that I try whenever possible 
to ascribe to premenstrual tension. I 
like the theory but unfortunately in 
this case I happened to know that it 
didn’t account for Klara, and of 
course it leaves unresolved at any 
time the question of how to account 
for me. 

At the hospital they kept me wait- 
ing for more than an hour, and then 
they hurt me a lot. I bled like a 
stuck pig, all over my shirt and 
pants, and while they were reeling 
out of my nose those endless yards 
of cotton gauze that Ham Tayeh had 
stuffed there to keep me from bleed- 
ing to death, it felt exactly as if

they were pulling out huge gobbets 
of flesh. I yelled. The little old 
Japanese lady who was working as 
out-patient paramedic that day gave 
me scant patience. “Oh, shut up, 
please,” she said. “You sound like 
that crazy returnee who killed him- 
self. Screamed for an hour.” 

I waved her away, one hand to 
my nose to stop the blood. Alarm 
bells were going off. “What? I 
mean, what was his name?” 

She pushed my hand away and 
dabbed at my nose. “I don’t 
know — oh . you were from that 
same hard-luck ship, weren’t you?” 

, “That’s what I am trying to find 
out. Was it Sam Kahane?” 

She became suddenly more hu- 
man. “I’m sorry, sweet,” she said. 
“I guess that was the name. They 
went to give him a shot to keep him 
quiet, and he got the needle away 
from the doctor and — Well, he 
stabbed himself to death.” 

It was a real bummer of a day, 
all right. 

In the long run she got me 
cauterized. “I’m going to put in 
just a little packing,” she said. 
“Tomorrow you can take it out 
yourself. Just be slow about it, and 
if you hemmorrhage get your ass 
down here in a hurry.” 

She let me go, looking like an 
axe-murder victim. I skulked up to 
Klara’s room to change my clothes, 
and the day went on being rotten. 
“Fucking Gemini,” she snarled at 
me. “Next time I go out, it’s going 
to be with a Taurean like that fel- 
low Metchnikov.” 

“What’s the matter, Klara?” 
“They gave us a bonus. Twelve 
thousand five! Christ. I tip my maid 
more than that.” 

97 



“How do you know?” I had al- 
ready divided $12,500 by five, and 
in the same split-second wondered 
whether, under the circumstances, 
they wouldn’t divide it by four in- 
stead. 

“They called on the P- phone ten 
minutes ago. Jesus. The rottenest 
son of a bitching trip I’ve ever been 
on, and I wind up with the price of 
one green chip at the casino out of 
it.” Then she looked at my shirt 
and softened a little. “Well, it’s not 
your fault, Bob, but Geminis never 
can make up their minds. I 
should’ve known that. Let me see 
if I can find you some clean 
clothes.” 

And I did let her do that, but I 
didn’t stay anyway. I picked up my 
stuff, headed for a drop-shaft, 
cached my goods at the registry of- 
fice where I signed up to get my 
room back and borrowed the use of 
their phone. When she mentioned 
Metchnikov’s name she had re- 
minded me of something I wanted 
to do. 

★ ★ ★ 

Metchnikov grumbled, but finally 
agreed to meet me in the school- 
room. I was there before him, of 
course. He loped in, stopped at the 
doorway, looked around and said: 
“Where’s what’ s-her- name?” 

“Klara Moynlin. She’s in her 
room.” Neat, truthful, deceitful. A 
model answer. 

“Urn.” He ran an index finger 
down each jaw-whisker, meeting 
under the shin. “Come on, then.” 
Leading me, he said over his shoul- 
der, “Actually she would probably 
get more out of this than you 
would.” 

“I suppose she would, Dane.” 

98 



“Um.” He hesitated at the bump 
in the floor that was the entrance to 
one of the instruction ships, then 
shrugged, opened the hatch and 
clambered down inside. 

He was being unusually open and 
generous, I thought, following him 
inside. He was already crouched in 
front of the course-selector panel, 
setting up numbers. He was holding 
a portable hand-readout detalinked 
to the Corporation’s master com- 
puter system; I knew that he was 
punching in one of the established 
settings, and so I was not surprised 
when he got color almost at once. 
He thumbed the fine-tuner and 
waited, looking over his shoulder at 
me, until the whole board was 
drowned in shocking pink. 

“All right,” he said. “Good, 
clear setting. Now look at the bot- 
tom part of the spectrum.” 

That was the smaller line of rain- 
bow colors along the right side of 
the board, red to violet. The violet 
was on the bottom, and the colors 
merged into one another without 
break, except for occasional lines of 
bright color or black. They looked 
exactly like what the astronomers 
called Fraunhofer lines, when the 
only way they had to know what a 
star or planet was made of was to 
study it through a spectroscope. 
They weren’t. Fraunhofer lines 
show what elements are present in a 
radiation source (or in something 
that has gotten itself between the 
radiation source and you). These 
showed God knows what. 

God and, maybe, Dane Metch- 
nikov, He was almost smiling, and 
astonishingly talkative. “That band 
of three dark lines in the blue,” he 
said. “See? They seem to relate to 

GALAXY 



the hazardousness of the mission. 
At least the computer printouts 
show that when there are six or 
more bands there the ships don’t 
come back.” 

He had my full attention. 
“Christ!” I said, thinking of a lot 
of good people who had died be- 
cause they hadn’t known that. 
“Why don't they tell us these 
things in school?” 

He said patiently (for him), 
“Broadhead, don’t be a jerk. All 
this is brand-new. And a lot of it is 
guesswork. Now, the correlation be- 
tween number of lines and danger 
isn’t quite so good under six. I 
mean, if you think that they might 
add one line for every additional 
degree of danger, you’re wrong. 
You would expect that the five-band 
settings would have heavy loss 
ratios, and when there are no bands 
at all there there wouldn’t be any 
losses. Only it isn’t true. The best 
safety record seems to be with one 
or two bands. Three is good, 
too — but there have been some 
losses. Zero bands we’ve had about 
as many as with three.” 

For the first time I began to think 
that the Corporation’s science- 
research people might be worth 
their pay. “So why don’t we just 
go out on destination settings that 
are safer?” 

“We’re not really sure they are 
safer,” Metchnikov said, again pa- 
tiently for him. His tone was far 
more peremptory than his words. 
“Also when you have an armored 
ship you should be able to deal with 
more risks than the plain ones. Quit 
with the dumb questions, 
Broadhead.” 

“Sorry.” I was getting uncom-

fortable, crouched behind him and 
peering over his shoulder, so that 
when he turned to look at me his 
jaw-whiskers almost grazed my 
nose. I didn’t want to change posi- 
tion. 

“So look up here in the yellow.” 
He pointed to five bright bands. 
“This reading seems to correlate 
with the success of the mission. 
God knows what we’re 
measuring — or what the Heechee 
were measuring — but in terms of fi- 
nancial rewards to the crews, 
there’s a pretty good correlation be- 
tween the number of lines in that 
frequency and the amount of money 
the crews get.” 

“Wow!” 

He went on as though I hadn’t 
said anything. “Now, naturally the 
Heechee didn’t set up a meter to 
calibrate how much in royalties you 
or I might make. It has to be 
measuring something else, who 
knows what? Maybe it’s a measure 
of population density in that area, 
or of technological development. 
Maybe it’s a Guide Michetin, and 
all they’re saying is that there was a 
four-star restaurant in that area. But 
there it is. Five-bar- yellow expedi- 
tions bring in a financial return, on 
the average, that’s fifty times as 
high as two-bar and ten times as 
high as most of the others.” 

He turned around again so that 
his face was maybe a dozen cen- 
timeters from mine, his eyes staring 
right into my eyes. “You want to 
see some other settings?” he asked, 
in a tone of voice that demanded I 
say no, so I did. “Okay.” And 
then he stopped. 

I stood up and backed away to 
get a little more space. “One ques-

tion, Dane. You probably have a 
reason for telling me all this before 
it gets to be public information. 
What is it?” 

“Right,” he said. “I want what’s 
her-name for crew if I go in a Three 
or a Five.” 

“Klara Moynlin.” 

“Whatever. She handles herself 
well, doesn’t take up much room, 
knows — well, she knows how to get 
along with people better than I do. I 
sometimes have difficulty in inter- 
personal relationships,” he ex- 
plained. “Of course, that’s only if I 
take a Three or a Five. I don’t par- 
ticularly want to. If 1 can find a 
One, that’s what I’m going to take 
out. But if there isn’t a One with a 
good setting available, I want 
somebody along I can rely on, who 
won’t get in my hair, who knows 
the ropes, can handle a ship — all 
that. You can come too, if you 
want.” 

★ ★ ★ 

When I got back to my own 
room Shicky turned up almost be- 
fore I started to unpack. He was 
glad to see me. “I am sorry your 
trip was unfruitful,” he said out of 
his endless stock of gentleness and 
warmth. “It is too bad about your 
friend Kahane.” He had brought me 
a flask of tea, and then perched on 
the chest across from my hammock, 
just like the first time. 

The disastrous trip was almost 
out of my mind, which was filled 
with visions of sugarplums coming 
out of my talk with Dane Metch- 
nikov. I couldn’t help talking about 
it; I told Shicky everything Dane 
had said. 

He listened like a child to a 

100 



fairytale, his black eyes shining. 
“How interesting,” he said. “I had 
heard rumors that there was to be a 
new briefing for everyone. Just 
think, if we can go out without fear 
of death or — ” He hesitated, flutter- 
ing his wing-gauze. 

“It isn’t that sure, Shicky,” I 
said. 

“No, of course not. But it is an 
improvement, I think you will 
agree?” He hesitated, watching me 
take a pull from the flask of almost 
flavorless Japanese tea. “Bob,” he 
said, “if you go on such a trip and 
need an extra man — Well, it is true 
that I would not be of much use in 
a lander. But in orbit I am as good 
as anybody.” 

“I know you are, Shicky.” I 
tried to put it tactfully. “Does the 
Corporation know that?” 

“They would accept me as crew 
on a mission no one else wanted.” 

“I see.” I didn’t say that I didn’t 
really want to go on a mission no 
one else wanted. Shicky knew that. 
He was one of the real old-timers 
on Gateway. According to the 
rumor he had had a big wad stashed 
away, enough for Full Medical and 
everything. But he had given it 
away or lost it, and stayed on, and 
stayed a cripple. I knew that he un- 
derstood what I was thinking, but I 
was a long way from understanding 
Shikitei Bakin. 

He moved out of my way while I 
stowed my things, and we gossiped 
about mutual friends. Sheri’s ship 
had not returned. Nothing to worry 
about yet, of course. It could easily 
be out another several weeks with- 
out disaster. A Congolese couple 
from just beyond the star-point in 
the corridor had brought back a 

GALAXY 



huge shipment of prayer fans from a 
previously unknown Heechee war- 
ren, on a planet around an F-2 star 
in the end of the Orion spiral arm. 
They had split a million dollars 
three ways, and had taken their 
share back to Mungbere. The 
Forehands — 

Louise Forehand stopped in while 
we were talking about them. 
“Heard your voices,” she said, 
craning over to kiss me. “Too bad 
about your trip.” 

“Breaks of the game.” 

“Well, welcome home, anyway. 
I didn’t do any better than you, I’m 
afraid. Dumb little star, no planets 
that we could find, can’t think why 
in the world the Heechee had a 
course setting for it.” She smiled, 
and stroked the muscles at the back 
of my neck fondly. “Can I give 
you a welcome-home party tonight? 
Or are you and Klara — ?” 

“I’d love it if you did,” I said, 
and she didn’t pursue the question 
of Klara. No doubt the rumor had 
already got around; the Gateway 
tomtoms beat day and night. She 
left after a few minutes. “Nice 
lady,” I said to Shicky, looking 
after her. “Nice family. Was she 
looking a little worried?” 

“I fear so, Robinette, yes. Her 
daughter Lois is on plus time. They 
have had much sorrow in that fami- 
ly-” 

I looked at him. He said, “No, 
not Willa or the father; they are out, 
but not overdue. There was a son.” 
“I know. Henry, I think. They 
called him Hat.” 

“He died just before they came 
here. And now Lois.” He inclined 
his head, then flapped politely over 
and picked up the empty tea flask 



on a downstroke of his wing. “I 
must go to work now, Bob.” 
“How’s the ivy planting?” 

He said ruefully, “I no longer 
have that position. I’m afraid. 
Emma did not consider me execu- 
tive material.” 

“Oh? What are you doing?” 

“I keep Gateway esthetically at- 
tractive, ’ he said. “I think you 
would call it ‘garbage collector.’ ” 

I didn’t know what to say. Gate- 
way was a kind of a trashy place; 
because of the low gravity, any 
scrap of paper or bit of feath- 
erweight plastic that was thrown 
away was likely to float anywhere 
inside the asteroid. You couldn’t 
sweep the floor. The first stroke set 
everything flying. I had seen the 
garbage men chasing scraps of 
newsprint and fluffs of cigarette ash 
with little hand-pumped vacuum 
cleaners, and I had even thought 
about becoming one if I had to. But 
I didn’t like Shicky doing it. 

He was following what I was 
thinking about him without any dif- 
ficulty. “It’s all right, Bob. Really, 
I enjoy the work. But — please; if 
you do need a crewman, think of 
me.” 

★ ★ 

I took my bonus and paid up my 
per-capita for three weeks in ad- 
vance. I bought a few items I 
needed — new clothes, and some 
music tapes to get the sound of 
Mozart and Palestrina out of my 
ears. That left me about two 
hundred dollars in money. 

Two hundred dollars was a lot 
like nothing at all. It meant twenty 
drinks at the Blue Hell, or one chip 

101 



GATEWAY 



at the blackjack table, or maybe 
half a dozen decent meals outside 
the prospectors’ commissary. 

So I had three choices. I could 
get another job and stall indefinite- 
ly. Or I could ship out within the 
three weeks. Or I could give up and 
go home. None of the choices was 
attractive. But, provided I didn’t 
spend any money on anything 
much, I didn’t have to decide for, 
oh, a long time — as long as twenty 
days. I resolved to give up smoking 
and boughten meals; that way I 
could budget myself to a maximum 
spending of nine dollars a day, so 
that my per capita and my cash 
would run out at the same time. 

I called Klara. She looked and 
sounded guarded but friendly on the 
P-phone, so I spoke guardedly and 
amiably to her. I didn’t mention the 
party, and she didn’t mention want- 
ing to see me that night, so we left 
it at that: nowhere. That was all 
right with me. I didn’t need Klara. 
At the party that night I met a new 
girl around called Doreen MacKen- 
zie. She wasn’t a girl, really; she 
was at least a dozen years older 
than I was, and she had been out 
five times. What was exciting about 
her was that she had really hit it 
once. She’d taken one and a half 
mil back to Atlanta, spent the whole 
wad trying to buy herself a career 
as a PV singer — material writer, 
manager, publicity team, advertis- 
ing, demo tapes, the works — and 
when it hadn’t worked she had 
come back to Gateway to try again. 
The other thing she was was very, 
very pretty. 

But after two days of getting to 
know Doreen I was back on the 
P-phone to Klara. She said, “Come 

102 



on down,” and she sounded anxi- 
ous; and I was there in ten minutes, 
and we were in bed in fifteen. The 
trouble with getting to know Doreen 
was that I had got to know her. She 
was nice, and a hell of a racing 
pilot, but she wasn’t Klara Moyn- 
lin. 

When we were lying in the ham- 
mock together, sweaty and relaxed 
and spent, Klara yawned, ruffled 
my hair, pulled back her head and 
stared at me. “Oh, shit,” she said 
drowsily, “I think this is what they 
call being in love.” 

I was gallant. “It’s what makes 
the world go around. No, not ‘it.’ 
You are.” 

She shook her head regretfully. 
“Sometimes I can’t stand you,” she 
said. “Sagitarreans never make it 
with Geminis. I’m a fire sign and 
you — Well, Geminis can’t help 
being confused.” 

“I wish you wouldn’t keep going 
on about that crap,” I said. 

She didn’t take offense. “Let’s 
get something to eat.” 

I slid over the edge of the ham- 
mock and stood up, needing to talk 
without touching for a moment. 
“Dear Klara,” I said, “look, I 
can’t let you keep me because 
you’ll be bitchy about it, sooner or 
later — or if you aren’t, I’ll be ex- 
pecting you to, and so I’ll be bitchy 
to you. And I just don’t have the 
money. You want to eat outside the 
commissary, you do it by yourself. 
And I won’t take your cigarettes, 
your liquor or your chips at the 
casino. So if you want to get some- 
thing to eat go ahead, and I’ll meet 
you later. Maybe we could go for a 
walk.” 

She sighed. “Geminis never

The Gateway Anglican 
The Rev. Theo Durleigh, 
Chaplain 
Parish Communion 
10:30 Sundays 
Evensong by Arrangement 

Eric Manier, who ceased 
to be my warden on 1 De- 
cember, has left an indel- 
ible mark on Gateway All 
Saint's and we owe him an 
incalculable debt for 
placing his multicompe- 
tence at our disposal . 
Born in Elstree, Herts., 
51 years ago, he graduated 
as an LL.B. in the Univer- 
sity of London and then 
read for the bar. Sub- 
sequently he was employed 
for some years in Perth at 
the natural gas works. If 
we are saddened for our- 
selves that he is leaving 
us, it is tempered with 
joy that he has now 
achieved his heart's de- 
sire and will return to 
his beloved Hertford- 
shire, where he expects to 
devote his retirement 
years to civic affairs, 
transcendental meditation 
and the study of plain- 
song. A new warden will be 
elected the first Sunday 
we attain a quorum of nine 
parishioners . 



know how to handle money,” she 
told me, ‘‘but they can be awfully 
nice in bed.” 

We put our clothes on and went 
out and got something to eat, all 
right, but in the Corporation com- 

GATEWAY 



missary, where you stand in line, 
carry a tray and eat standing up. 
The food isn’t bad, if you don’t 
think too much about what sub- 
strates they grow it on. The price is 
right. It doesn’t cost anything. They 
promise that if you eat all your 
meals in the commissary you will 
have one hundred plus per cent of 
all the established dietary needs. 
You will, too, only you have to eat 
all of everything to be sure of that. 
Single-cell protein and vegetable 
protein come out incomplete when 
considered independently, so it’s 
not enough to eat the soy-bean jelly 
or the bacterial pudding alone. You 
have to eat them both. 

The other thing about these meals 
is they produce a hell of a lot of 
methane, which produces a hell of a 
lot of what all ex-Gateway types 
remember as the Gateway fug. 

We drifted down toward the 
lower levels afterward, not talking 
much. I suppose we were both 
wondering where we were going. I 
don’t mean just at that moment. 
“Feel like exploring?” Klara asked. 

I took her hand as we strolled 
along, considering. That sort of 
thing was fun. Some of the old 
ivy-choked tunnels that no one used 
were interesting, and beyond them 
were the bare, dusty places no one 
had troubled even to plant ivy in. 
Usually there was plenty of light from 
the ancient walls themselves, still 
glowing with that bluish Heechee- 
metal sheen. Sometimes — not late- 
ly, but no more than six or seven 
years ago — people had actually 
found Heechee artifacts in them, 
and you never knew when you 
might stumble on something worth 
a bonus. 

103 



But I couldn’t work up much en- 
thusiasm for it, because nothing is 
fun when you don’t have a choice. 
“Why not?” I said, but a few min- 
utes later, when I saw where we 
were, I said, “Let’s go to the 
museum for a while.” 

“Oh, right,” she said, suddenly 
interested. “Did you know they’ve 
fixed up the surround room? 
Metchnikov was telling me about it. 
They opened it while we were 
out.” 

So we changed course, dropped 
two levels and came out next to the 
museum. The surround room was a 
nearly spherical chamber just be- 
yond it. It was big, ten meters or 
more across, and in order to use it 
we had to strap on wings like Shic- 
ky’s, hanging on a rack outside the 
entrance. Neither Klara nor I had 
ever used them before, but it wasn’t 

104 



hard. On Gateway you weigh so lit- 
tle to begin with that flying would 
be the easiest and best way to get 
around, if there were any places in- 
side the asteroid big enough to fly 
in. 

So we dropped through the hatch 
into the sphere, and were in the 
middle of a whole universe. The 
chamber was walled with hexagonal 
panels, each one of them projected 
from some source we could not see, 
probably digital with liquid-crystal 
screens. 

“How pretty!” Klara cried. 

All around us there was a sort of 
globarama of what the scouting 
ships had found. Stars, nebulae, 
planets, satellites. Sometimes each 
plate showed its own independent 
thing so that there were, what was 
it, something like a hundred and 
twenty-eight separate scenes. Then,

flick, all of them changed; flick 
again, and they began to cycle, 
some of them holding their same 
scene, some of them changing to 
something new. Flick again, and 
one whole hemisphere lit up with a 
mosaic view of the M-31 galaxy as 
seen from — God knew where. 

“Hey,” I said, really excited, 
“this is great!” And it was. It was 
like being on all the trips any pros- 
pector had ever taken, without the 
drudgery and the trouble and the 
constant fear. 

There was no one there but us, 
and 1 couldn’t understand why. It 
was so pretty. You would think 
there would be a long line of people 
waiting to get in. One side began to 
run through a series of pictures of 
Heechee artifacts, as discovered by 
prospectors: prayer fans of all col- 
ors, well-lining machines, the in- 

GATEWAY 



sides of Heechee ships, some 
tunnels — Klara cried out that they 
were places she had been, back 
home on Venus, but I don’t know 
how she could tell. Then the pattern 
went back to photographs from 
space. 

Some of them were familiar. 
I could recognize the Pleiades in 
one quick six- or eight-panel shot, 
which vanished and was replaced by 
a view of Gateway Two from out- 
side, two of the bright young stars 
of the cluster shining in reflection 
off its sides. I saw something that 
might have been the Horsehead 
Nebula, and a doughnut-shaped puff 
of gas and dust that was either the 
Ring Nebula in Lyra or what an 
exploring team had found a few or- 
bits before they called the French 
Cruller, in the skies of a planet 
where Heechee digs had been de- 

105 



tected, but not reached, under a fro- 
zen sea. 

We hung there for half an hour or 
so, until it began to look as though 
we were seeing the same things 
again, and then we fluttered up to 
the hatch, hung up the wings and 
sat down for a cigarette break in a 
wide place in the tunnel outside the 
museum. 

Two women I recognized vaguely 
as Corporation maintenance crews 
came by, carrying rolled-up strap-on 
wings. “Hi, Klara,” one of them 
greeted her. “Been inside?” 

Klara nodded. “It was beauti- 
ful,” she said, 

“Enjoy it while you can,” said 
the other one. “Next week it’ll cost 
you a hundred dollars. We’re put- 
ting in a P-phone taped lecture sys- 
tem tomorrow, and they’ll have the 
grand opening before the next 
tourists show up.” 

“It’s worth it,” Klara said, but 
then she looked at me. 

I became aware that, in spite of 
everything, I was smoking one of 
her cigarettes. At five dollars a pack 
I couldn’t afford very much of that, 
but I decided to buy at least one pack 
out of that day’s allowance, and to 
make sure she took as many from me 
as I took from her. 

“Want to walk some more?” 

“Maybe a little later,” I said. I 
was wondering how many men and 
women had died to take the pretty 
pictures we had been watching, be- 
cause I was facing one more time 
the fact that sooner or later I would 
have to submit myself again to the 
lethal lottery of the Heechee ships, 
or give up. I wondered if the new 
information Metchnikov had given 
me was going to make a real differ- 

106 



ence. Everyone was talking about it 
now; the Corporation had scheduled 
an all-phone announcement for the 
next day. 

“That reminds me,” I said. “Did 
you say you’d seen Metchnikov?” 
“I wondered when you’d ask me 
about that,” she said. “Sure. He 
called and told me he’d shown the 
color-coding stuff to you. So I went 
down and got the same lecture. 
What do you think. Bob?” 

I stubbed out the cigarette. “I 
think everybody in Gateway’s going 
to be fighting for the good 
launches, that’s what I think.” 

“But maybe Dane knows some- 
thing. He’s been working with the 
Corporation.” 

“I don’t doubt he does.” I 
stretched and leaned back, rocking 
against the low gravity, considering. 
“He’s not that nice a guy, Klara. 
Maybe he’d tell us if there’s some- 
thing good coming up, you know, 
that he knows something special 
about. But he’ll want something for 
it.” 

Klara grinned. “He’d tell me.” 
“What do you mean?” 

“Oh, he calls me once in a 
while. Wants a date.” 

“Oh, shit, Klara.” I was feeling 
pretty irritated by then. Not just at 
Klara, and not just about Dane. 
About money. About the fact that if 
I wanted to go back into the sur- 
round room next week it would cost 
me half my credit balance. About 
the dark, shadowed image looming 
up ahead in time, and not very far 
ahead, when I would once again 
have to make up my mind to do 
what I was scared silly to do again. 
“I wouldn’t trust that son of a bitch 
as far as — ” 



GALAXY 



“Oh, relax. Bob. He’s not such a 
bad guy,” she said, lighting another 
cigarette and leaving the pack where 
I could reach it if I wanted it. 
“Sexually, he might be kind of in- 
teresting. That raw, rough, rude 
Taurean thing — Anyway, you’ve 
got as much to offer him as I do.” 
“What are you talking about?” 
She looked honestly surprised. “I 
thought you knew he swings both 
ways.” 

He’s never given me any 
indication — ” But I stopped, re- 
membering how close he liked to 
get when he was talking to me, and 
how uncomfortable I was with him 
inside my body space. 

“Maybe you’re not his type,” 
she grinned. Only it wasn’t a kindly 
grin. A couple of Chinese crewmen, 
coming out of the museum, looked 
at us with interest, and then politely 
looked away. 

“Let’s get out of here, Klara.” 

So we went to the Blue Hell, and 
of course I insisted on paying my 
share of the drinks. Forty-eight dol- 
lars down the tube in one hour. And 
it wasn’t all that much fun. We 
wound up in her place in bed again. 
That wasn’t all that much fun, 
either. The quarrel was still there 
when we finished. And the time 
was slipping by.

There are people who never pass

The better it gets, the more they

GATEWAY 



Hacking around Gateway with 
Klara, I began to suspect that I was 
one of those people. I knew Klara 
was. She had never maintained a re- 
lationship with a man for more than 
a few months in her life; she told 
me so herself. Already I was pretty 
close to a record with her. And al- 
ready it was making her edgy. 

In some ways Klara was a lot 
more adult and responsible than I 
ever would be. The way she got to 
Gateway in the first place, for in- 
stance. She didn’t win a lottery to 
pay her fare. She earned it and 
saved it, painfully, over a period of 
years. She was a fully qualified air- 
body driver with a guide’s license 
and an engineering degree. She had 
lived like a fish-famier while earn- 
ing an income that would have enti- 
tled her to a three-room flat in the 
Heechee warrens on Venus, vaca- 
tions on Earth and Major Medical. 
She knew more than I did about the 
growing of food on hydrocarbon 
substrates, in spite of all my years 
in Wyoming. (She had invested in a 
food factory on Venus, and for all 
her life she had never put a dollar 
into anything she didn’t fully under- 
stand.) When we were out together, 
she was the senior member of the 
crew. It was she Metchnikov 
wanted as a shipmate — if he wanted 
anybody — not me. She had been my 
teacher! 

And yet between the two of us 
she was as inept and unforgiving as 
ever I had been with Sylvia, at the 
age of twenty, or with Deena, 
Janice, Liz, Ester or any of the 
other two-week romances that had 
all ended badly in all the years after 
Sylvia. It was, she said, because 
she was a Sagittarius and I was a 

107 



Gemini. Sagittarians were prophets. 
Sagittarians loved freedom. Us poor 
Geminis were just terribly mixed up 
and* indecisive. “It’s no wonder,” 
she told me gravely one morning, 
eating breakfast in her room (I ac- 
cepted no more than a couple of 
sips of coffee), “that you can’t 
make your mind up to go out again. 
It isn’t just physical cowardice, dear 
Robinette. Part of your twin nature 
wants to triumph. Part wants to fail. 
I wonder which side you will allow 
to win?” 

I gave her an ambiguous answer. 
I said, “Honey, go screw 
yourself.” And she laughed, and 
we got through that day. She had 
scored her point. 

The Corporation made its ex- 
pected announcement, and there 
was an immense flurry of conferring 
and planning and exchanging guesses 
and interpretations among all of 
us. It was an exciting time. Out of 
the master computer’s files the Cor- 
poration pulled twenty launches 
with low danger factors and high 
profit expectancies. They were sub- 
scribed, equipped and launched 
within a week. 

And I wasn’t on any of them, 
and neither was Klara; and we tried 
not to discuss why. 

Surprisingly, Dane Metchnikov 
didn’t go out on any of them. He 
knew something, or said he did. Or 
didn’t say he didn’t when I asked 
him, just looked at me in that glow- 
ering, contemptuous way and didn’t 
answer. Even Shicky almost went 
out. He lost out in the last hour be- 
fore launch to the Finnish boy who 
had never been able to find anyone 
to talk to; there were four Saudis 
who wanted to stay together, and 

108 



settled for the Finnish kid to fill out 
a Five. Louise Forehand didn’t go 
out either, because she was waiting 
for some member of her family to 
come back, so as to preserve some 
sort of continuity. You could eat in 
the Corporation commissary now 
without waiting in line, and there 
were empty rooms all up and down 
my tunnel. And one night Klara 
said to me, “Bob, I think I’m going 
to go to a shrink.” 

I jumped. It was a surprise. 
Worse than that, a betrayal. Klara 
knew about my early psychotic 
episode and what I thought of 
psycho-therapists. 

I withheld the first dozen things I 
thought of to say to her — tactical: 
“I’m glad; it’s about time”; hypo- 
critical: “I’m glad, and please tell me 
how I can help”; strategic: “I’m 
glad, and maybe I ought to go too, 
if I could afford it.” I refrained 
from the only truthful response, 
which would have been: “I interpret 
this move on your part as a con- 
demnation of me for bending your 
head.” I didn’t say anything at all, 
and after a moment she went on: 

“I need help, Bob. I’m con- 
fused.” 

That touched me, and I reached 
out for her hand. She just let it lay 
limp in mine, not squeezing back 
and not pulling away. She said: 
“My psychology professor used to 
say that was the first step — no, the 
second step. The first step when 
you have a problem is to know you 
have it. Well, I’ve known that for 
some time. The second step is to 
make a decision: Do you want to 
keep the problem, or do you want 
to do something about it? I’ve de- 
cided to do something about it.” 

GALAXY 



“Where will you go?” I asked, 
carefully non-commital. 

“I don’t know. The groups don’t 
seem to do much. There’s a shrink 
machine available on the Corpora- 
tion master computer. That would 
be the cheapest way.” 

“Cheap is cheap,” I said. “I 
spent two years with the shrink 
machines when I was younger, after 
I — I was kind of messed up.” 

“And since then you’ve been 
operating for twenty years,” she 
said reasonably. “I’d settle for that. 
For now, anyway.” 

I patted her hand. “Any step you 
take is a good step,” I said kindly. 
“I’ve had the feeling all along that 
you and I could get along better if 
you could clear some of that old 
birthright crap out of your mind. 
We all do it, I guess, but I’d rather 
have you angry at me on my own 
than because I’m acting as a surro- 
gate for your father or something.” 
She rolled over and looked at me. 
Even in the pale Heechee-metal 
glow I could see surprise on her 
face. “What are you talking 
about?” 

“Why, your problem, Klara. I 
know it took a lot of courage for 
you to admit to yourself that you 
needed help.” 

“Well, Bob,” she said, “it did, 
only you don’t seem to know what 
the problem is. Getting along with 
you isn’t the problem. You may be 
the problem. I just don’t know. 
What I’m worried about is stalling. 
Being unable to make decisions. 
Putting it off so long before I went 
out again — and, no offense, picking 
a Gemini like you to go out with.” 
“I hate it when you give me that 
astrology crap!”

“You do have a mixed up per- 
sonality, Bob, you know you do. 
And I seem to lean on that. I don’t 
want to live that way.” 

We were both wide awake again 
by then, and there seemed to be two 
ways for things to go. We could get 
into a but-you-said-you-loved-me, 
but-I-can’t-stand-this scene, prob- 
ably ending with either more sex or 
a wide-open split; or we could do 
something to take our minds off it. 
Klara’s thoughts were clearly mov- 
ing in the same direction as mine, 
because she slid out of the ham- 
mock and began pulling on clothes. 
“Let’s go up to the casino,” she 
said brightly. “I feel lucky to- 
night.” 

+ * * 

There weren’t any ships in and 
no tourists. There weren’t all that 
many prospectors, either, with so 
many shiploads going out in the 
past few weeks. Half the tables at 
the casino were closed down, with 
the green cloth hoods over them. 
Klara found a seat at the black jack 
table, signed for a stack of 
hundred-dollar markers, and the 
dealer let me sit next to her without 
playing. “I told you this was my 
lucky night,” she said when, after 
ten minutes, she was more than two 
thousand dollars ahead of the house. 

“You’re doing fine,” I encour- 
aged her, but actually it wasn’t that 
much fun for me. I got up and 
roamed around a little bit. Dane 
Metchnikov was cautiously feeding 
five-dollar coins into the slots but 
he didn’t seem to want to talk to 
me. Nobody was playing baccarat. I 
told Klara I was going to get a cup 

109 



of coffee at the Blue Hell (five dol- 
lars, but in slow times like this they 
would keep filling the cup for noth- 
ing). She flashed me a quarter- 
profile smile without ever taking her 
eyes off the cards. 

In the Blue Hell Louise Forehand 
was sipping a rocket-fuel-and- 
water . well, it wasn’t really 
rocket fuel, just old-fashioned white 
whiskey made out of whatever hap- 
pened to be growing well that week 
in the hydroponics tanks. She 
looked up with a welcoming smile, 
and I sat down next to her. 

She had, it suddenly occurred to 
me, a rather lonely time of it. No 
reason she had to. She was — well, I 
don’t know exactly what there was 
about her, but she seemed like the 
only non-threatening, non- 
reproachful, non-demanding person 
on Gateway. Everybody else either 
wanted something I didn’t want to 
give, or refused to take what I was 
offering. Louise was something 
else. She was at least a dozen years 
older than I, and really very good 
looking. Like me she wore only the 
Corporation standard clothes, short 
coveralls in choice of three unattrac- 
tive colors. But she had remade 
them for herself, converting the 
jumpsuit into a two-piece outfit with 
tight shorts, bare midriff and a 
loose, open sort of top. I discovered 
that she was watching me take in- 
ventory and I suddenly felt embar- 
rassed. “You’re looking good,” I 
said. 

“Thanks, Bob. All original 
equipment, too,” she bragged, and 
smiled. “1 never could afford any- 
thing else.” 

“You don’t need anything you 
haven’t had all along,” I told her

Mission Report 

Vessel A3-7, Voyage 022D55. Crew 
S. Rigney, E. Tsein, M. Sindler. 

Transit time 18 days 0 hours. Posi- 
tion vicinity Xi Pegasi A. 

Summary. “We emerged in close 
orbit of a small planet approximately 9 
A.U. from primary. The planet is ice- 
covered, but we detected Heechee radia- 
tion from a spot near the equator. Rig- 
ney and Mary Sindler landed nearby 
and with some difficulty — the location 
was mountainous — reached an ice-free 
warm area within which was a metallic 
dome. Inside the dome were a number 
of Heechee artifacts, including two 
empty landers, some equipment of un- 
known use and a heating coil. We suc- 
ceeded in transporting most of the smal- 
ler items to the vessel. It proved impos- 
sible to stop the heating coil entirely, 
but we reduced it to a low level of op- 
eration and stored it in the lander for 
the return. Even so, Mary and Tsien 
were seriously dehydrated and in coma 
when we landed. 

“There was intense Heechee radiation 
from a source near the other component 
of the binary, Xi Pegasi B. The distance 
was too great for us to cover in the 
lander.” 

Corporation evaluation: Heating coil 
analyzed and rebuilt. Award of 
$3,000,000 made to crew against royal- 
ties. Other artifacts not as yet analyzed. 
Award of $25,000 per kilo mass, total 
$675,000, made against future exploita- 
tion if any. 

Note; Three additional expeditions, 
including one Armored Five, were sent 
to the same destination. None returned. 



sincerely, and she changed the sub- 
ject. 

“There’s a ship coining in,” she 
GALAXY 



said. “Been a long time out, they 
say.” 

Well, I knew what that meant to 
her, and that explained why she was 
sitting around in the Blue Hell in- 
stead of being asleep at that hour. I 
knew she was worried about her 
daughter, but she wasn’t letting it 
paralyze her. 

She had a very good attitude 
about prospecting, too. She was 
afraid of going out, which was sen- 
sible. But she didn’t let that keep 
her from going, which I admired a 
lot. She was still waiting for some 
other member of her family to re- 
turn before she signed on again, as 
they had agreed, so that whoever 
did come back would always find 
family waiting. 

She told me a little more about 
their background. They had lived, 
as far as you could call it living, in 
the tourist traps of the Spindle on 
Venus, surviving on what they 
could eke out, mostly from the 
cruise ships. There was a lot of 
money there, but there was also a 
lot of competition. The Forehands 
had at one time, 1 discovered, 
worked up a nightclub act: singing, 
dancing, comedy routines. I 
gathered that they were not bad, at 
least by Venus standards. But the 
few tourists that were around most 
of the year had so many other birds 
of prey battling for a scrap of their 
flesh that there just wasn’t enough 
to nurture them all. Sess and the 
son (the one who had died) had 
tried guiding, with an old airbody 
they had managed to buy wrecked 
and rebuild. No big money there. 
The girls had worked at all kinds of 
jobs. I was pretty sure that Louise, 
at least, had been a hooker for a 

GATEWAY 



while, but that hadn’t paid enough 
to matter either, for the same sorts 
of reasons as everything else. They 
were nearly at the end of their rope 
when they managed to get to Gate- 
way. 

It wasn’t the first time for them. 
They’d fought hard to get off Earth 
in the first place, when Earth got so 
bad for them that Venus had 
seemed a less hopeless alternative. 
They had more courage, and more 
willingness to pull up stakes and 
go, than any other people I’d ever 
met. 

“How did you pay for all this 
travel?” I asked. 

“Well,” said Louise, finishing 
her drink and looking at her watch, 
“going to Venus we traveled the 
cheapest way there is. High-mass 
load. Two hundred and twenty other 
immigrants, sleeping in shoulder 
clamps, lining up for two-minute 
appointments in the toilets, eating 
compressed dry rations and drinking 
recycled water. It was a hell of a 
way to spend forty thousand dollars 
apiece. Fortunately the kids weren’t 
bom yet, except Hat, and he was 
small enough to go for quarter- 
fare.” 

“Hat’s your son? What — ” 

“He died,” she said. 

I waited, but when she spoke 
again what she said was: “They 
should have a radio report from that 
incoming ship by now.” 

“It would have been on the 
P-phone.” 

She nodded, and for a moment 
looked worried. The Corporation 
always makes routine reports on in- 
coming contacts. If they don’t have 
a contact — well, dead prospectors 
don’t check in by radio. So I took 

111 



her mind off her troubles by telling 
her about Klara’s decision to see a 
shrink. She listened and then put 
her hand over mine and said, 
“Don’t get sore. Bob. Did you ever 
think of seeing a shrink yourself?” 

“I don’t have the money, 
Louise.” 

“Not even for a group? There’s a 
primal-scream bunch on Level Dar- 
ling. You can hear them sometimes. 
And there’ve been ads for 
everything — R/A, EST, patterning. 
Of course, a lot of them may have 
shipped out.” 

But her attention wasn’t on me. 
From where we were sitting we 
could see the entrance to the casino, 
where one of the croupiers was talk- 
ing interestedly to a crewman from 
the Chinese cruiser. Louise was 
staring that way. 

“Something’s going on,” I said. 
“I would have added, “Let’s go 
look,” but Louise was out of the 
chair and heading for the casino be- 
fore me. 

Play had stopped. Everybody was 
clustered around the blackjack table, 
where, I noticed, Dane Metchnikov 
was now sitting next to Klara in the 
seat I had vacated, with a couple of 
twenty-five dollar chips in front of 
him. And in the middle of them 
was Shicky Bakin, perched on a 
dealer’s stool, talking. “No,” he 
was saying as I came up, “I do not 
know the names. But it’s a Five.” 

“And they’re all still alive?” 
somebody asked. 

“As far as I know. Hello, Bob. 
Louise.” He nodded politely to us 
both. “I see you’ve heard?” 

“Not really,” Louise said, reach- 
ing out unconsciously to hold my 
hand. “Just that a ship is in. But 

112 



you don’t know the names?” 

Dane Metchnikov craned his head 
around to glare at her. “Names,” 
he growled. “Who cares? It’s none 
of us, that’s what’s important. And 
it’s a big one.” He stood up. Even 
at that moment I noticed the mea- 
sure of his anger: he forgot to pick 
up his chips from the blackjack ta- 
ble. “I’m going down there,” he 
announced. “I want to see what a 
once-in-a-lifetime score looks like.” 

★ * ★ 

The cruiser crews had closed off 
the area, but one of the guards was 
Francy Hereira. There were a 
hundred people around the drop- 
shaft, and only Hereira and two 
girls from the American cruiser to 
keep them back. Metchnikov 
plunged through to the lip of the 
shaft, peering down, before one of 
the girls chased him away. We saw 
him talking to another five-bracelet 
prospector. Meanwhile we could 
hear snatches of gossip: 

“ — almost dead. They ran out of 
water.” 

“Nah! Just exhausted. They’ll be 
all right — ” 

“ — ten million dollar bonus if it’s 
a nickel, and then the royalties!” 

Klara took Louise’s elbow and 
pulled her toward the front. I fol- 
lowed in the space they opened. 
“Does anybody know whose ship it 
was?” she demanded. 

Hereira smiled wearily at her, 
nodded at me, and said, “Not yet, 
Klara. They’re searching them now. 
I think they’re going to be all right, 
though.” 

Somebody behind me called out, 
“What did they find?” 



GALAXY 



“Artifacts. New ones, that’s all I 
know.” 

“But it was a Five?’’ Klara 
asked. Hereira nodded, then peered 
down the shaft. 

“All right,” he said, “now, 
please back up, friends. They’re 
bringing some of them up now.” 

We all moved microscopically 
back, but it didn’t matter; they 
weren’t getting off at our level any- 
way. The First one up the cable was 
a Corporation bigwig whose name I 
didn’t remember, then a Chinese 
guard, then someone in a Terminal 
Hospital robe with a medic on the 
same grip of the cable, holding him 
to make sure he didn’t fall. I knew 
the face but not the name; I had 
seen him at one of the farewell par- 
ties, maybe at several of them, a 
small, elderly black man who had 
been out two or three times without 
scoring. His eyes were open and 
clear enough, but he looked infi- 
nitely fatigued. He looked without 
astonishment at the crowd around 
the shaft, and then was out of sight. 

I looked away and saw that 
Louise was weeping quietly, her 
eyes closed. Klara had an arm 
around her. In the movement of the 
crowd I managed to get next to 
Klara and look a question at her. 
“It’s a Five,” she said softly. “Her 
daughter was in a Three.” 

I knew Louise had heard that, so 
I patted her and said, “I'm sorry, 
Louise,” and then a space opened 
at the lip of the shaft and I peered 
down. 

I caught a quick glimpse of what 
ten or twenty million dollars looked 
like. It was a stack of hexagonal 
boxes made out of Heechee metal, 
not more than half a meter across 



and less than that tall. Then Francy 
Hereira was coaxing, “Come on, 
Bob, get back, will you?” And I 
stepped away from the shaft while 
another prospector in a hospital robe 
came up. She didn’t see me as she 
went past; in fact her eyes were 
closed. But I saw her. It was Sheri.

“I feel pretty foolish, Sigfrid,” I 
say. 

“Is there some way I can make 
you feel more comfortable?” 

“You can drop dead.” He has 
done his whole room over in 
nursery-school motifs, for Christ’s 
sake. And the worst part is Sigfrid 
himself. He is trying me out with a 
surrogate mother this time. He is on 
the mat with me, a big stuffed doll, 
the size of a human being, warm, 
soft, made out of something like a 
bath towel stuffed with foam. It 
feels good, but — “I guess I don’t 
want you to treat me like a baby,” 
I say, my voice muffled because 
I’m pressing my face against the 
toweling. 

“Just relax, Robby. It’s all 
right.” 

“In a pig’s ass it is.” 

He pauses, and then reminds me: 
“You were going to tell me about 
your dream.” 

“Yech.” 

“I’m sorry, Robby?” 

“I mean I don’t really want to 
talk about it. Still,” I say quickly, 
lifting my mouth away from the tow- 
eling, “I might as well do what 
you want. It was about Sylvia, kind 
of.” 

“Kind of, Robby?” 

“Well, she didn’t look like her-

self, exactly. More like — I don’t 
know, someone older, I think. I 
haven’t thought of Sylvia in years, 
really. We were both kids. ...” 
‘‘Please go on, Robby,” he says 
after a moment. 

I put my arms around him, look- 
ing up contentedly enough at the 
wall of circus-poster animals and 
clowns. It is not in the least like 
any bedroom I occupied as a child, 
but Sigfrid knows enough about me 
already, there is no reason for me to 
tell him that. 

‘‘The dream, Robby?” 

“I dreamed we were working in 
the mines. It wasn’t actually the 
food mines. It was, physically, I 
would say more like the inside of a 
Five — one of the Gateway ships, 
you know? Sylvia was in a kind of 
a tunnel that went off it.” 

‘‘The tunnel went off?” 

“Now, don’t rush me into some 
kind of symbolism, Sigfrid. I know 
about vaginal images and all that. 
When I say ‘went off,’ I mean that 
the tunnel started in the place where 
I was and led in a direction away 

114 



from it.” I hesitated, then told him 
the hard part. “Then her tunnel 
caved in. Sylvia was trapped.” 

I sat up. “What’s wrong with 
that,” I explained, “is that really 
that couldn’t happen. You only tun- 
nel in order to plant charges to 
loosen up the shale. All the real 
mining is scoop-shovel stuff. Syl- 
via’s job would never have put her 
in that position.” 

“I don’t think it matters if it 
could really have happened, 
Robby.” 

“I suppose not. Well, there was 
Sylvia, trapped inside the collapsed 
tunnel. I could see the heap of shale 
stirring. It wasn’t really shale. It 
was fluffy stuff, more like scrap 
paper. She had a shovel, and she 
was digging her way out. I thought 
she was going to be all right. She 
was digging a good escape hole for 
herself. I waited for her to come 
out. .only she didn’t come out.” 
Sigfrid lies warm and waiting in 
my arms. It is good to feel him 
there. 

Of course, he isn’t really there. 
He isn’t really anywhere, except 
maybe in the central data stores 
in Washington Heights, where the 
big machines are kept. All I have is 
his remote-access terminal in a 
bunny suit. 

“Is there anything else, Robby?” 
“Not really. Not part of the 
dream, anyway. But — well, I do 
have a feeling. I feel as though I 
kicked Klara in the head to keep her 
from coming out. As though I was 
afraid the rest of the tunnel was 
going to fall on me.” 

“What do you mean by a ‘feel- 
ing,’ Rob?” 

“What I said. It wasn’t part of 

GALAXY 



the dream. It was just that I felt — I 
don’t know.” 

He waits, then he tries a different 
approach. ‘‘Bob. Are you aware 
that the name you said just then was 
‘Klara,’ not ‘Sylvia?’ ” 

‘‘Really? That’s funny. I wonder 
why.” 

He waits, then he prods a little. 
‘‘Then what happened, Rob?” 

“Then I woke up." 

I roll over on my back and look 
up at the ceiling, which is textured 
tile with glittery five-pointed stars 
pasted to it. “That’s all there is,” I 
say. Then I add, conversationally, 
“Sigfrid, I wonder if all this is get- 
ting anywhere.” 

“I don’t know if I can answer 
that question, Rob.” 

“If you could,” I say, “I would 
have made you do it before this.” I 
still have S. Ya’s. little piece of pa- 
per, which gives me a kind of se- 
curity I prize. 

“I think,” he says, “that there is 
somewhere to get. By that I mean I 
think there is something in your 
mind that you don’t much want to 
think of, to which this dream is re- 
lated.” 

“Something about Sylvia, for 
Christ’s sake? That was year.? ago.” 

“That doesn’t really matter, does 
it?” 

“Oh, shit. You bore me, Sigfrid! 
You really do.” Then I reflect. 
“Say, I’m getting angry. What does 
that mean?” 

“What do you think it means, 
Rob?” 

“If I knew I wouldn’t have to 
ask you. I wonder. Am I trying to 
cop out? Getting angry because 
you’re getting close to something?” 

“Please don’t think about pro- 

GATEWAY 



cess, Rob. Just tell me how you 
feel.” 

“Guilty,” I say at once, without 
knowing that’s what I was going to 
say. 

“Guilty about what?” 

“Guilty about — I’m not sure.” I 
lift my wrist to look at my watch. 
We’ve got twenty minutes yet. A 
hell of a lot can happen in twenty 
minutes, and I stop to think about 
whether I want to get really shaken 
up. I’ve got a game of duplicate 
lined up for that afternoon, and I 
have a good chance to get into the 
finals. If I don’t mess it up. If I 
keep my concentration. 

“I wonder if I oughtn’t to leave 
early today, Sigfrid,” I say. 

“Guilty about what, Rob?” 

“I’m not sure I remember.” I 
stroke the bunny neck and chuckle. 
“This is really nice, Sigfrid, al- 
though it took me a while to get 
used to it.” 

“Guilty about what, Rob?” 

I scream: “About murdering her, 
you jerk!” 

“You mean in your dream?” 

“No! Really. Twice.” 

I know I am breathing hard, and 
I know Sigfrid’s sensors are regis- 
tering it. I fight to get control of 
myself, so he won’t get any crazy 
ideas. I go over what I have just 
said in my mind, to tidy it up. “I 
didn’t really murder Sylvia, that is. 
But I tried! Went after her with a 
knife!” 

Sigfrid, calm, reassuring: “It 
says in your case history that you 
had a knife in your hand when you 
had a quarrel with your friend, yes. 
It doesn’t say you ‘went after 
her.’ ” 

“Well, why the hell do you think 

115 



they put me away ? It’s just luck I 
didn’t cut her throat.” 

“Did you, in fact, use the knife 
against her at all?” 

“Use it? No. I was too mad. I 
threw it on the floor and got up and 
punched her.” 

‘‘If you were really trying to 
murder her, wouldn’t you have used 
the knife?” 

“Ah!” Only it was more like 
‘yech’; the word you sometimes see 
written as “pshaw.” “I only wish 
you’d been there when it happened, 
Sigfrid. Maybe you would have 
talked them out of putting me 
away.” 

The whole session is going sour. 
I know it’s always a mistake to tell 
him about my dreams. He twists 
them around. I sit up, looking with 
contempt at the crazy furnishings 
Sigfrid has dreamed up for my ben- 
efit, and I decide to let him have it, 
straight from the shoulder. 

“Sigfrid,” I say, “as computers 
go, you’re a nice guy, and 1 enjoy 
these sessions with you in an intel- 
lectual way. But I wonder if we 
haven’t gone about as far as we can 
go. You’re just stirring up old, un- 
necessary pain and I frankly don’t 
know why I let you do that to me.” 

“Your dreams are full of pain, 
Bob.” 

“So let it stay in my dreams. I 
don’t want to go back to all that 
same stale kind of crap they used to 
give me at the Institute. Maybe I do 
want to go to bed with my mother. 
Maybe I do hate my father because 
he died and deserted me. So 
what?” 

“I know that is a rhetorical ques- 
tion, Bob, but the way to deal with 
these things is to bring them out 

116 



into the open.” 

“For what? To make me hurt?” 
“To let the inside hurt come out 
where you can deal with it.” 

“Maybe it would be simpler all 
around if I just made up my mind 
to go on hurting a little bit, inside. 
As you say, I’m well compensated, 
right? I’m not denying that I’ve got 
something out of all this. There are 
times, Sigfrid, when we get through 
with a session, and I really get a lift 
out of it. I go out of here with my 
head full of new thoughts, and the 
sun is bright on the dome and the 
air is clean and everybody seems to 
be smiling at me. But not lately. 
Lately I think it’s very boring and 
unproductive, and what would you 
say if 1 told you I wanted to pack it 
in?” 

“I would say that that was your 
decision to make. Bob. It always 
is.” 

“Well, maybe I’ll do that.” The 
old devil outwaits me. He knows 
I’m not going to make that deci- 
sion, and he is giving me time to 
realize it for myself. Then he says: 
“Bob? Why did you say you 
murdered her twice?” 

I look at my watch before I an- 
swer, and I say, “I guess it was 
just a slip of the tongue, I really do 
have to go now, Sigfrid.” 

I pass up the time in his recovery 
room, because I don’t actually have 
anything to recover from. Besides I 
just want to get out of there. Him 
and his dumb questions. He acts so 
wise and superior, but what does a 
mechanical bunny know?

In the face of the strongest temp- 
tation imaginable, I will not tell you 
a whole lot about Nonexistacon I, 
the most mismanaged fiasco in the 
history of fandom. I’d love to tell 
you about how 1 got conned (pun 
intended) .into being Trawnacon’s 
free Guest of Honor (they just didn’t 
tell me I was GoH until I arrived), 
and what went wrong with the 
movies (ever seen a Cinemascope 
print through an ordinary lens?), 
and all the complex foulups which 
led to there being exactly eight paid 
attendees and no sf hucksters (in 
Toronto'.),' and why I got home 
four days late by train (no bullshit 
honest to god I swear: CN “air- 
conditions” those cars by shoveling 
a half a ton of ice underneath each 
one. I’m serious, I tell you), and 1 
would most especially like to name 
the single schmuck at whose feet 
can be laid virtually all responsibil- 
ity for both the fiasco and its mag- 
nitude. 

But it would take a whole col- 
umn, and those who need to be 
warned against the said schmuck 
will hear by grapevine, and besides 
this is a bookshelf, dammit. So. I’ll 
only tell you the relevant part: the 
Good Part. 

118 



Since the only hucksters who 
heard about the con were comic 
book dealers, I was forced to ven- 
ture into Toronto itself to slake my 
whetted thirst for sf. And there, on 
June 19, 1976, I found the answer 
to all of our prayers. 

Since I asked you folks for feed- 
back, the mailbox has swelled to 
bursting, and one complaint has 
been universal: “What the hell 
good,” you’ve asked repeatedly, 
“does it do us to read in your col- 
umn about all these nifty books — 
when the local drugstore doesn’t 
stock ’em and the local bookstore’s 
distributors won’t take orders for 
less than ten copies?” It’s a valid 
complaint, and up to now the only 
thing I’ve had to suggest is that you 
find somehow a bookstore (like The 
Corner Bookstore, Rte. 25A, 
Setauket, NY) courageous enough 
to try and survive independently , 
without knuckling under to the mass 
mediocrity of the distribution/ 
monopoly. But such are as common 
as wool brassieres — so I’ve found 
you a better answer. 

Know ye that there exists in far 
Toronto a vasty store that men call 
Bakka, and that it stocks only sf 
and related books, and that its col- 
lection in both paper and hardback 
is immense, and that it has an ex- 
cellent mail order service. 

I spent two delirious hours in 
Bakka, babbling and raving, buying 
books that I had thought only 
rumors, locating legendary unob- 
tainable classics and even old mags 

GALAXY 



in excellent condition, and British 
and foreign-language editions unob- 
tainable anywhere else I know. 
Then I found out I could have 
stayed home in the Red Palace and 
enjoyed the same orgy. 

I spoke at great length with the 
management, and they strike me as 
honest, competent men and women 
passionately devoted to sf. They 
will send you their new catalog/ 
fanzine, an approximately 100-page 
mag chock full of articles, cartoons 
and comix in addition to the book 
listing, for $1,50, and promise to 
update it at least twice a year. They 
ask that payments be made by either 
certifed check or money order, 
either Canadian funds or add 30 on 
the dollar (yes, Canadian money is 
worth more — although every bank 
in America routinely knocks off 5% 
in changing a traveler’s money. A 
hallmark of American courtesy and 
fair play). On orders over $15 
Bakka will pay the postage — but 
those of you in the States want to 
bear in mind that the insidious cus- 
toms parasites will probably nick 
you ten percent or so. Worth it, in 
my opinion: Bakka’ s selection had 
me drooling down my bib, and a 
fast browse through the catalog 
shows me ten more gems I missed 
and will order as soon as Baen 
comes across with my pay for this 
column. 

Those of you who ’re cynical or 
paranoid: wait till next month, and 
I’ll tell you how my mail order 
came out. The address (bet you 

BOOKSHELF 



thought I’d forget, didn’t you?) is 
Bakka, 282-286 Queen St., To- 
ronto, Ontario M5V 2A1 (Canada). 

Back to the books I go, secure in 
the knowledge that, in telling you 
about these volumes, I am no 
longer micturating upwind. No 
more frustration, no more tantaliz- 
ing glimpses of The Promised 
Book — gee, it’s nice to be relevant 
again. 

Thanks, Bakka.

And the first book on the list is a 
genuine masterpiece, by Ghod. 

Run do not walk to wherever you 
gotta go to score a copy of 
Mindbridge, Joe Haldeman’s second 
and best novel. It’s too early in the 
year to make Hugo predictions, but 
Mindbridge is certain to be at least 
a finalist. 

I wish I could give you the usual 
capsule plot summary, the quick 
sketch, the teasers that make you 
want to hear more, but Mindbridge 
refuses condensation or distillation 
down to a manageable size. Perhaps 
I might handle it from another di- 
rection, by claiming that a) in terms 
of style, it is the equal of Stand On 
Zanzibar, b) in terms of attention- 
grabbing and pace, it is the equal of 
anything Alfred Bester ever wrote, 
c) in terms of scope, it is the equal 
of Joe’s own Nebula-and Hugo- 
winning Forever War, d) in terms 
of characterization it is superior to 
War, and e) in terms of sheer story 

119 



it is damn near unmatched. 

It is, in sum, one helluva book, 
through all kinds of critical goggles. 
There ain’t no such thing as a book 
everybody loves, and at least two 
friends of mine have come away 
from Bridge with complaints — stuff 
like “the alien psychology was a lit- 
tle inconsistent” (seems to me that 
makes it more believable) and “a 
certain interesting concept was left 
undeveloped” (you want Joe to do 
all your imaging for you?) and “the 
technological developments ad- 
vanced his plot a bit too conve- 
niently” (you mean there was too 
much science?), and I have no 
doubt that you can unearth gripes of 
your own. But I strongly suggest 
that you begin reading well before 
suppertime (if you are one of those 
unfortunates who has to get up in 
the mornings), because there’s no 
way you’ll put it down unfinished. 

I guess I could give you a kind 
of summary, as misleading as they 
always are (by virtue of what they 
don't say), by calling Mindbridge 
the most mature study of telepathy 
since John Brunner’s The Whole 
Man. For those of you who won- 
dered if Joe could sustain the 
level-of-excellence set by his first 
novel: no, he can’t. He has to get 
better. 

He seems to be that kind of writ- 
er. 

Lucky us.

As I told you in my Pangborn 
panegyric a few months ago, Edgar 
began writing before there was 
hair — but dated the true beginning 
of his writing career from the publi- 
cation (in Galaxy, June 1951) of 
“Angel’s Egg,” a novelette created 
twenty years after the publication of 
his first novel. When I read that in 
the Locus obit,**! had only the 
vaguest of recollections of “Egg,” 
a story I had last read at age eight, 
so I resolved to hunt for it. And 
then a generous fan whose name 
and letter I have unforgivably lost 
sent me a copy of Good Neighbors 
and Other Strangers , the Pangborn 
short-collection which contains 
“Egg,” and nine others. 

Knowing Edgar, I expected this 
book to rate 100% on the Spider 
Scale (stories enjoyed - total stories 
X 100). But I was way off in this 
prediction. I sometimes allot an 
extra 5% for a story' I consider to be 
in some way classic, and so this 
collection rates 150%. It is the best 
single-author antho I have ever 
read, and I’m including Tiptree, 
Heinlein and Delany in my calcula- 
tions. 

But 150% ain’t high enough. The 
other nine stories are masteipieces, 
but “Angel’s Egg” is the finest 
novelette I know, a story that leaves 
you feeling warm and proud and 
happy-sad, one of those rare works 
where style, characterization and 
story are one and the same,, facets 
of a single operant genius. Many in- 
telligent and talented writers have 

GALAXY 



indicted mankind; Edgar is one of 
the rare, mature, wise few who 
have learned to forgive it. 

I don’t care if Neighbors isn’t 
available in your area: you MUST 
read it. Bakka will have it, or you 
could write to Collier ( a division of 
MacMillan; try the NYC phone- 
book), and if that don’t work, 
come up to Phinney’s Cove and I’ll 
lend you my copy. 

You’ll be glad you went to the 
trouble.

I’ve been getting one or two 
complaints lately that there are too 
many raves in this column ( nobody 
complains about the hatchet jobs; 
bloodthirsty bunch, aren’t you?): 
people seem to think that if I like a 
lotta books, I must have no taste. 
These people will continue to be 
disappointed for at least four pages 
yet — with two raves behind me, I’m 
nowhere near done with praising 
yet. I call ’em like I see ’em, and it 
happens that this month past has 
been a good one indeed, and the 
next specimen, too, deserve an un- 
qualified rave. 

Harlan Ellison’s new album, ti- 
tled (with characteristic modesty) 
Harlan !, is not only the only thing I 
know with an exclamation point in 
the title that’s any damn good, it is 
also the finest spoken-word record- 
ing I’ve ever heard, both in content 
and in delivery. 

It contains unabridged readings of 

BOOKSHELF 



“ ‘Repent, Harlequin!’ said the 
Ticktockman” (wups, another ex- 
clamation point — and this one won a 
Hugo and a Nebula) and “Shatter- 
day” (1976 Nebula finalist) by Har- 
lan himself, complete with sound 
effects, plus a superb jacket- 
painting by the Dillons, with liner 
notes by Isaac Asimov. If you’re 
unfamiliar with either story, they’re 
giants; and if you’ve never heard 
Harlan read his stuff, boy are you 
in for a treat. They actually come 
off better than they do on paper. 

What else can I say? Oh yeah. 
Alternate Worlds Recordings’ ad- 
dress is 148 East 74th Street, New 
York NY 10021, and I’m afraid I 
don’t know how much they 
charge — I heard a guess of $6.50. 
In addition to the R. E. Howard and 
Leiber records 1 reviewed last 
month, they have a Robert Bloch 
upcoming, and a Bloch/Ellison 
“Jack The Ripper” planned. 

* *■ * 

I’ve established a precedent of 
reviewing science fact books in this 
column, when they seemed suffi- 
ciently significant or interesting 
(read: when I got a review copy, 
and liked it). So I’d like to direct 
your attention to at least two books 
by a writer named John McPhee. 

McPhee’s kind of writing is 
called “reportage,” as you might 
expect from a staffer for The New 
Yorker — but I’m certain the term 
will mislead you. For this man is a 

121 



superb stylist, a writer who makes 
world-class story-telling look as ef- 
fortless as an Astaire solo. But what 
he does with his writing is report on 
stuff, and the two books herein con- 
sidered, The Curve of Binding 
Energy and The Deltoid Pumpkin 
Seed, are reportage of events and 
people of intense interest to the 
serious and thoughtful science fic- 
tion writer or reader; they are 
fluidly readable documentation of a 
state of mind without which “sci- 
ence fiction” would be a meaning- 
less term with no referent: what 
Robert Persig, in Zen and the Art of 
Motorcycle Maintenance calls the 
“classical mode of thought,” per- 
ception of the underlying form 
rather than the object itself. What 
us kneejerk sf enthusiasts call “a 
technological orientation.” 

These books are, in short, about 
mad geniuses (genii?), visionaries. 
Pumpkin Seed is about a group of 
them, who worked (more or less) 
together in secret frenzy for twelve 
years to build a rigid airship — a 
practical dirigible — designed by a 
computer. Binding Energy is about 
a successful visionary: Theodore B. 
Taylor, designer of the world’s 
largest and smallest hydrogen 
bombs ( size measurement, not 
megatonnage) and the first man in 
history to light a cigarette with a 
hydrogen bomb. Neither book is 
near as narrow in scope as these 
thumbnail descriptions imply: Seed 
is really about Realization of Dream 
as a concept, and Energy focuses on 

122 



Taylor’s determined campaign to 
tighten up nuclear-materials secu- 
rity (he and McPhee went around 
breaking into and out of government 
plutonium repositories in their street 
clothes; they both have a disturbing 
habit of describing the amounts they 
could have stolen in terms of what 
fraction thereof would annihilate the 
World Trade Center.). Both books 
are absorbing, informative and 
fluent, and I recommend them unre- 
servedly. I understand Ballantine 
has a paperback of Energy out, but 
I haven’t seen it and so can’t give 
you the vital statistics — take my 
word, they’re each worth hardback 
prices. Remarkable books, by a 
truly remarkable writer.

Goddam, it’s like drowning in 
whiskey — I can’t seem to get this 
silly grin off my face. Remember 
last month, when I reviewed 
Frazetta and Fabian together and 
said that Fabian didn’t suffer much 
by comparison with the master? 
Well, I’m doing it again this month, 
only this time Frazetta suffers by 
comparison with Fabian . 

Okay, lemme "splain. If Frazetta 
ever drew or painted a bad lick, he 
kept it in his briefcase, agreed. But 
this collection comprises a few 
major and many minor works (and I 
mean doodles in some cases), all 
reproduced in black and white with 
only mediocre accuracy on fair 
paper in 8I/2 X 11 “comic” format 

GALAXY 



and nowhere on it is the publisher 
identified. (No, this is not therefore 
a pointless review — I saw copies in 
Bakka, so you can obtain it.) Nor is 
there a price quoted — the huckster 
at Trawnacon was asking $6.50, but 
1 bartered instead. It does contain 
an (apparently) complete checklist 
of everything Frazetta ever pub- 
lished, but these works are named, 
not identified: there’s no clue as to 
where or how or from whom to ob- 
tain them. (If any of you know, I’d 
love to find out.) 

Now understand, there’s some 
dandy stuff in Treasure: it contains 
some of Frazetta’ s most . er . 
sensuous (read: doity) work, and it 
was interesting to see that the 
Frazetta poster for a movie called 
Luana (apparently based on a book 
by Alan Dean Foster) is Frank’s 
own classic painting “Sun God- 
dess” with the addition of a chim- 
panzee, a Negro with a rifle, and a 
wholly uncalled-for bra on the God- 
dess herself. I found the book worth 
swapping an original Callahan’s 
manuscript for, and I’m glad I’ve 
got it. 

But if you only have a few bucks 
to spend on sf art this month (or 
year), you’d be much better advised 
to lay out an extra $1.50 for 
Stephen Fabian’s stupendous folio, 
Fantastic Nudes . 

At eight clams, this is clearly the 
steal of the year, whether your mo- 
tives are aesthetic or prurient. It is 
an outsized (14 X 11) unbound folio 
(no staples to remove) containing 

BOOKSHELF 



ten black-and-white plates and two 
cover drawings, each a triumph of 
painstaking repro, each prominently 
featuring a lady with no clothes on. 
They are all, singly and together, 
heartbreakingly beautiful. Each 
character is taken from some fan- 
tasy classic (Howard, Merritt, 
Smith, etc.), “not ... to picture 
actual scenes . but . (as) a 
springboard for Fabian’s talents on 
some stories of yesteryear that he 
might not normally have had a 
chance to illustrate.” To Gerry and 
Helen de la Ree, who apparently 
conceived this splendid idea, my 
heartiest thanks and good wishes. 
You can order Fantastic Nudes 
from them at 7 Cedarwood Lane, 
Saddle River NJ 07458. They still 
have some Finlay and Bok in Stok, 
too, but surely nothing as fine as 
this? (Canada Customs held F.N. up 
for two full weeks, on the flimsy 
excuse that, being unbound, it did 
not constitute a “book” and there- 
fore wasn’t “bonafide review 
material” — they were kind enough 
not to wrinkle the pages, at least). 

But be sure and place a basin full 
of tepid saline solution on your lap 
before you unwrap this folio: it’ll 
knock your eyes out. 

Before I leave Fabian, I must 
also mention a curious and appeal- 
ing series-publication from Pyramid 
called Fiction Illustrated. I missed 
Volume One, something called 
Schlomo Raven (?), but when I saw 
Fabian’s name on the cover of Vol- 
ume Two, Starfawn, I snatched it at 

123 



once. (Nearly got busted for shoplift- 
ing.) I was not disappointed . 
much. 

Starfawn is a thorough blending 
of sf and the graphic story format. 
It is a full length science fiction 
novella, told in “comic book” 
mode, lovingly illustrated in full 
gorgeous color and printed up in 
paperback or pulp size (at 6 3/4 x 
5, it is either/neither, and can be 
found on either shelf at the whim of 
the drugstore owner). The novella 
was written by Byron Preiss (editor 
of the Weird Heroes series, about 
which more next month), who appar- 
ently produced the whole affair. 
Fabian did the pencils and “techni- 
cal consultant” work, the justly- 
famed Marie Severin did the color- 
ing, and Annatte Kawecki handled 
“calligraphy” — what a low-life 
comic-book would call “lettering.” 

So. Four aspects to cover. Well, 
Preiss’s story is not what I’d call 
first-rate sf. Way too many named 
characters (12), of whom only two 
are ever really developed (one of 
the insignificant ones is named 
“Bova”), and a plot so torturously 
complex and jargonful that I simply 
can’t tell you if it makes any sense 
at all — but still no worse than your 
average Marvel comic or one of the 
bad Star Treks. Fabian’s illos are 
somewhat hurried looking, a trifle 
sloppy in spots; but hell, there are 
hundreds of ’em, and the bulk of 
’em are just great, with that trippy 
quality Steve does so well. Kawecki’s 
lettering manages to make vis- 
124 



ual sense out of some extremely 
cluttered dialogue, and Severlin’s 
extremely careful and subtle color- 
ing job (miles ahead of what comics 
usually bother with) is what, in the 
final analysis, made the book (at 
least for me). She has a gentle, 
mescaline-y way with color that 
perfectly sets off Fabian’s B&W 
style; I fervently hope they collabo- 
rate some more. Lots more. 

* * * 

Okay. So far this month we’ve 
given you a smash novel, a smash 
collection, a smash record (not to 
be confused with Smash Records, 
Inc.), two smash science fact books 
and a buncha smash artwork. Are 
we done with ringing the changes 
on a normal, sane book review col- 
umn? 

NO. 

Hell, no, in fact: here’s a double 
twist. A guest review, by my 
neighbor and eleven-year friend, 
Anne Trudell ... of a book of sci- 
ence fiction Poetry. I frankly don’t 
feel qualified to judge poetry (de- 
spite seven years as an English 
major), and back when Annie had 
time to write the stuff she was 
damn good, so . 

★ ★ ★ 

The honorable Spider got waylaid 
on Song Three of this poetry opus 
( Aniara , by Harry Martinson), so he 
decided to pass it on to me on the 

GALAXY 



off chance that my dabbling in vers 
serious of several years ago might 
enable me to wade through it better 
than he. 

And wade I did, through about the 
first fifteen Songs, wondering how 
anything so heavy and clay-footed 
could be about the ethereal mys- 
teries of Space and men’s souls. I 
didn’t know whether to blame it on 
the author or the translators (it 
being from the Swedish); or had my 
spirit of poesy simply deserted me? 

But by about Song Twenty things 
were looking better, and after that it 
was free flight. After I finished the 
book, I went back to the first fifteen 
songs, and yup, they were heavy 
and clay-footed. Maybe it was a 
device of the author’s to give con- 
trast, but it is Pyrrhic in effect: 
people who would be interested in 
Aniara because of its science- 
fictional character (its framework is 
the voyage- without-conceivable-end 
of a spaceship loaded with emi- 
grants, that gets diverted off-course 
and finds itself shooting for the 
constellation Lyra, with no turning 
back) would find themselves shelv- 
ing it with a “Yecch” by about the 
Sixth Song at most — and many a 
person who would be interested in it 
for its poetry would shelve it with a 
“This is poetry?’’ by maybe the 
Tenth Song. 

But there are about a hundred and 
two Songs altogether and the last 
eighty are just fine, really bringing 
home to you the effects of despair 
on the human spirit, and some 

BOOKSHELF 



realization of how vast space really 
is — so much so that one can say 
perhaps the underlying premise of 
Samuel Delany’s “Star-Pit” isn’t so 
far fetched after all but contains a 
grain of bitter truth: man’s spirit 
may not be built for the enormity of 
intergalactic distances. 

To this (me again) I can only add 
that Aniara is the latest in Avon’s 
excellent “SF Rediscovery” series, 
and has a lovely cover by an unfor- 
tunately uncredited artist.

Me again. 

I liked Buzz Busby’s first two 
Barton books (To Cage A Man and 
The Proud Enemy) considerable, 
and said so in print, and so Buzz 
wrote me a thank you letter (note to 
you other ingrate bums; the only 
one I’ve received this year) and tip- 
ped me to the existence of Rissa 
Kerguelen , his newest and most 
ambitious work. “I really went 
overboard this time,” Buzz 
wrote,” — more than 100 names, 
onstage characters in 266,000 words 
covering 4 planets and 103 years. 
But I vow and promise — Dhalgren it 
ain’t.” As a single volume it would 
have run about 640 pages. 

So the cost of paper being what it 
is, Berkley decided to approxi- 
mately bisect the thing — the last, 
oh, third of Rissa Kergulen will 
have been released by the time you 
read this, under the title The Long 
View , but I haven’t read it as of this 

125 



writing. What I have read is the two 
thirds of Rissa’s story that has her 
name as title, and if you bear in 
mind that it was never intended to 
end where it does, it is one helluva 
book. 

Rissa is certainly the strongest 
heroine ever created by a male sf 
writer, and may be one of the 
strongest ever: she makes Jirel of 
Joiry seem merely competent and 
somewhat lacking in ambition. The 
future universe she inhabits seems 
largely as uncaring and oppressive 
and sexist as the one we live 
in — but Rissa manages to bend it to 
her will, compromising only when 
and for as long as she must, pursu- 
ing her goals with quiet, dogged 
ferocity. She is what we might call, 
in the interests of semantic preci- 
sion, “tough fatha” — not tough in 
the Spillanian sense, but tough- 
minded, in the Heinleinian sense, 
And for this tough fatha, Busby 
creates a tough motha: a Pirage 
King, salty enough to be her 
equal — and the way Busby tells it, 
their marriage works splendidly, on 
a basis of solid mutual respect 
(something so rare in sf that the only 
example I can call to mind is the 
Randall/Craig marriage in Hein- 
lein's The Unpleasant Profession of 
Jonathan Hoag). 

On the basis of this first volume, 
I’m prepared to recommend the 
whole two-book saga. Buzz has 
built so well that it would take a 
monumental-fiasco of an ending to 
spoil it now. I’ll confirm it when 
126 



Long View arrives, but as of now 
this book, too, is a strong Hugo 
contender for my money. 

Ohyez — according to Buzz, the 
eventual Berkley paperback will be 
just the one gigantic volume, uncut 
and discrete. Start making a large 
space in your bookshelf. 

* * * 

By god, a non-sf book in the 
Bookshelf. 

Well, it is and it isn’t. The Mul- 
tiple Man satisfies all the definitions 
of sf I ever heard of, but it isn’t 
being billed as such: Bobbs-Merrill 
is advertising it as “A Novel of 
Suspense,” and the overleaf copy 
tersely notes that “Ben Bova has 
many fine novels to his credit. He 
has also written some two dozen 
science books for the layman. He is 
editor of Analog Magazine . ” A 
layman, someone who does not 
know what sort of stuff Analog 
prints, will never suspect upon read- 
ing this that he is about to read a 
science fiction book. 

And I understand how come. A 
true blue sf fan, or even a washy 
powder- blue one, will look at the 
flyleaf description of the premise 
and say at once, “Cripes, what’s 
the big mystery? Obviously the 
President’s a clone.” And, feeling 
that his or her intelligence has been 
slighted, he or she will put the book 
down unread. Which would be a 
hell of a shame, because it’s a fine 
book. 



GALAXY 



So pretend you’re a Mainstream 
reader, and that you don’t know 
what the Big Secret is. Put yourself 
in the place of the first-person 
narrator — who is not an sf fan — and 
follow him through his dilemma: he 
is the Press Secretary to the Presi- 
dent of the United States, and two 
exact doubles of the President have 
been found — both as dead as mac- 
kerels. Consider the notion of a 
President who has something for 
everyone — because he is in fact 
eight different experts who happen 
to be genetically identical. Ponder 
the morality and ethics of that. 
Consider the difficulty of determin- 
ing which one of these utterly iden- 
tical men has begun murdering his 
clone-brothers — without allowing 
this potential dynamite to leak into 
the papers. Suppose that you are 
this Press Secretary, someone to 
whom “cloning” has been until 
now a concept filed in the Sunday 
Supplement Stuff drawer in your 
memory — and suppose further that 
you are a highly moral man, deeply 
aware of the conflict in your loyal- 
ties to your President and to your 
country — hell, to your species. 
What do you do? 

Why, you become only one of a 
bunch of finely drawn and warmly 
real characters in a deftly-plotted 
and fast-paced novel of 
suspense — which quite incidentally 
happens to be a science fiction 
novel, if only because it hasn’t hap- 
pened yet. 

Has it?

One last lump before I degenerate 
into minireviews: a book by John 
Boyd. 

In reviewing Boyd’s uneven but 
hilarious Andromeda Gun several 
months ago (March 1976 Book- 
shelf), I mentioned that I’d never 
heard of him before. So two broth- 
ers (both writers) from San Diego, 
Steven L. and John F. Carr, mailed 
me some of Boyd’s books. I 
haven’t had a chance to read Pol- 
linators of Eden or The Organ Bank 
Farm yet, but you'll hear from me 
when I do; right now we’re talk- 
ing about The Last Starship From 
Earth , a 1968 paperback. 



BOOKSHELF 



127 



And this one too is slightly un- 
even and entirely hilarious, with 
some breathtaking twists. It’s a 
peculiar kind of plot: it requires 
suspension of a massive amount of 
disbelief, which is okay for a delib- 
erately whacky book — and yet, 
Boyd plays it with just enough of a 
straight face to keep you from ap- 
proaching it the way you would 
another whacky book, say, a 
Sheckley or a Goulart (Boyd is 
much funnier than Goulart). If you 
don't know Boyd, you might decide 
on page 20 that “this whole thing is 
absurd’’ without realizing that it’s 
mean! to be: his pan is just a bit too 
dead. 

So forewarned, though, you 
ought to find Starship delightful, 
with a rigorously consistent internal 
logic that doesn’t really become ap- 
parent until the very last chapter. 
Arthur Clarke’s cover blurb calls it 
“a fascinating sf novel — one of the 
most convincing I’ve ever encoun- 
tered.” 1 don’t know if I’d go that 
far — but granted some demented 
premises, it is pretty convincing. 
And the surprise ending (which ex- 
plains many seeming inconsisten- 
cies) worked for me: I didn’t guess. 
Well, I suspected, but . 

As of this writing I’m one chap- 
ter into Pollinators, which so far 
looks like Light Sex Comedy Meets 
Science Fiction; more next month. 
Meanwhile, thank you Steve and 
John for passing along such a subtly 
funny book: to paraphrase an old 
sexist joke, it’s nice to know that 

128 



some Carrs break up . 

★ ★ ★ 

On to the minis: 

Run , Come See Jerusalem has 
exactly the same surprise ending as 
Starship , but I guessed it on page 
one — and 1 read Meredith’s book 
first. 1 found Jerusalem a bit over- 
written; but the characterization was 
just fine, and the background was 
satisfyingly inventive. Overall a 
pretty fair read — and if Meredith 
learns how to edit himself, we may 
all be hearing much more of him by 
and by. 

Stargate : this book, apparently, 
began the “stargate” fad in sf — 
I’ve seen ten dozen stargate stories 
lately, and I just wrote one myself 
(called “Tin Ear”). Robinett’s book 
is as daffy, fastpaced and stylisti- 
cally brilliant as the Analog seriali- 
zation was, and you’ll like it. For 
awhile now I’ve been saying, half 
in fun, that “I just don’t like 
Robinett stories as much as I liked 
Tak Hallus stories” (Stephen’s 
former pseudonym — means “pen- 
name” in Arabic). But changing the 
name didn’t hurt this book any. 
How the hell did Robinett/Hallus 
miss winning a John W. Campbell 
Award? 

The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress : 
to praise Taj Mahal may be a kind 
of arrogance — but my truthful word, 
this book is finest historical novel 
ever written (who cares if history 
hasn’t happened yet?), contains 

GALAXY 



some of most delightful characters 
anywhen, pulls off plot miracles 
with no huhu, and (as always) did 
have me thinking in Loonie (instead 
of clumsy American) for days after 
this third re-reading. Possibly Hein- 
lein’s most perfect novel — certainly 
dinkum book in any case. First and 
perhaps only believable aware- 
computer in all sf. Seminal study of 
the inevitable marriage of technol- 
ogy and revolutionary Warfare. 
That cobber Heinlein has bolshoyeh 
imagination, nyet? 

The Light Fantastic : a recollec- 
tion of some of Alfred Bester’s 
finest short fiction: “Fondly 

Fahrenheit” (with author’s commen- 
tary); “5,271,009”; . Cham- 

pagne Bottle”; “Four-Hour 
Fugue”; “The Men Who Murdered 
Mohammed”; “Disappearing Act” 
— all classics — plus a huge 
35,00-word novella called “Hell Is 
Forever,” which ran in Unknown in 
’42 and ain’t been seen since. It 
serves to prove that Alfie has al- 
ways been both raving mad and a 
genius. There are delightful Beste- 
rian intros to each story, and 
“5,271,009” is one of my 
alltimefaves. 

Ancient, My Enemy: a spectacu- 
lar collection of incredibly varied 
stories by an Old Master, in pa- 
perback at long last — what more 
can 1 say? Well, I could say that the 
true breadth and depth of Gordy’s 
talent are nowhere better displayed: 
if you think he’s “a guy that writes 
Dorsai stories,” buy this book and 

BOOKSHELF 



get hip. Gordy consistently 
scratches my mind where it itches. 

In the Problem Pit: not much to 
say about this either, except that it’s 
about 140% on the Spider Scale: the 
title story is one of the best novelet- 
tes in recent years, at least five 
others are genuine masterpieces and 
there are two overwhelmingly excel- 
lent essays included. Fred says in 
his intro that he has written some 
bad stories; they must have gotten 
lost in the mail. I’ve certainly never 
seen one. 

There you go: an entire over- 
sized column of disgustingly ful- 
some and fatuous praise — all of it 
utterly deserved. The law of aver- 
ages dictated that someday I’d get a 
golden month: this has been it. 

Or have I just gone soft? 

I don’t think so. This column is 
still (and will remain) Spider Versus 
The Hax of Sol III — but I’m taking 
advantage of a lull in the battle to 
identify some of my allies for you. 

The general-issue run of sf re- 
leases will just have to pile up for a 
couple of months: I have two 
theme-columns coming up. Next 
month, a whole column devoted to 
recent sf by women — which I’m re- 
ally looking forward to — next, a 
half column or so (more if more 
books show up meantime) on the 
Pyramid Harlan Ellison explosion. 
If that don't keep you on the edge 
of your seat, your fanny must be 
greased. 

Stick around — things are looking 
up. ★

The Rock and the Pool were all 
they had, all they needed, all 
they wanted. Except for one. 



The food came from the rock. It 
came out in drops and in frothy 
bubbles, which burst and slowly 
dried into thin nutritious scales. 
When chewed these softened read- 
ily, and became a sweet liquid in 
the mouth. Their flavor was made 
more pleasant by hunger, for there 
was no other food. There never had 
been. 

There were several ways to pre- 
pare the food. Usually it was placed 
in bowls, and clear water was 
poured over it. This mixture became 
a pinkish, cloudy fluid with an ex- 
citing odor. Its taste was delicious. 
It was a pleasant thing to fill bowls 
with the food, set them about on 
small boulders, and eat in friendly 
companionship. After food it was 
good to drink water together, a 
bowlful for each. Then everyone 
was satisfied, and life could go on. 

The water came from the Pool. It 
was a large Pool, and the water in it 
was continually renewed. How this 
happened was never clear, for none 
flowed into it, and none fell from 
above, out of the cloudless sky. 
There were stories that water had 
once fallen thus, but they were non- 
sense. Water came only from the 
Pool. And there was only one Pool. 

THE ROCK AND THE POOL 



From the Pool and the Rock the 
flatland stretched away into limitless 
distance in all directions. Legend 
said that there was no end to it; that 
it went on and on forever. How 
such knowledge could be was not 
understood, for no one could travel 
out across the barren distance. 
There was no water and no food. 
So, only by the Pool and the Rock 
was there life. 

And yet, far away across that 
empty space, there was Something. 
Sometimes, toward the end of the 
day, when the yellow light no 
longer beat down, but instead made 
the boulders cast long shadows 
across the warm sand, faint dark 
masses seemed to lie where the sky 
met the land. 

The Big Little One knew nothing 
of such things, but he was soon to 
learn. From the time he first could 
scurry from under the shelving rock 
where his mother had her burrow, 
the cool, dark friendly space she 
called ‘home’, he was endlessly 
curious. The world was pleasant. 
The warm sand, when the light was 
fading, had a clean smell. And 
nothing could be finer than the 
freshness of the air when the Pool 
was approached. Of course, he 
early learned that this was not al- 
lowed. There were always watchers 
at the Pool. Only adults could go 
near. 

He quickly understood that water 
was precious. Even before he 
ceased to feed from his mother’s 
body, he was given a bowl, and his 

131 



mother might dip it once for him at 
each time of eating, just as she 
dipped her larger bowl twice for her- 
self. One bowl she poured over the 
food from the Rock; the other she 
drank when neighbors came from 
their own burrows, carrying their 
own bowls. They sat in the cooling 
shadows, sipping water, and having 
simple speech about the pleasant- 
ness of the world. 

He listened, bright-eyed, and 
agreed. Life was good. But never 
could he enjoy it quietly. Even be- 
fore he rose and walked upright, he 
would scurry about on all fours, 
from shade spot to shade spot, and 
into other burrows, for which he 
was always promptly and gently 
removed by the owners. 

He learned, but he did not agree 
with what he learned. He did not 
understand why there were restric- 
tions. He saw no reason why he 
should not approach the Rock and 
the Pool. 

“One bowl of water is good,” he 
told his mother. “Why can’t I have 
two? I could always drink more.” 
“No one drinks more than one 
bowl,” his mother explained. “It 
has never been done. That way, 
there is always enough.” 

“It is a big Pool,” he persisted. 
“It is never empty.” 

“That is because no one drinks 
more than one bowl.” 

He looked at his mother, tiny, 
wizened, gentle, with dull placid 
eyes and little shriveled hands. And 
he had a new thought. 

132 



“If you had drunk more than one 
bowl, you would be larger.” he 
said. 

This seemecfto puzzle her. 

“I would not want to be larger,” 
she said at last. “Home would be 
too small. My neighbors would not 
like it.” 

“If they had drunk more than one 
bowl, they would be larger too.” 

Her small thin face showed mild 
alarm. 

“Then the Pool would soon be 
empty. There would be no food. 
We would all die.” 

“There is food higher on the 
Rock than anyone can reach. If you 
were larger, you could reach 
higher.” 

“But—” 

He could see that his thought 
confused and disturbed her. He 
twisted his small face, patted her 
with a still baby hand, and said 
with a wisdom far beyond his brief 
life: 

“I am wrong. You are right. One 
bowl of water is enough.” 

But he did not for a minute 
change his mind. And he did not 
speak his thoughts to any other 
adult. Instead, he acted. 

There were always watchers at 
the Pool, but they did not watch 
very closely. There really was no 
reason to watch. No one thought of 
breaking custom. The water was 
life. As his mother had said, no one 
ever drank more than one bowl. 

At the Rock, too, there were 
watchers. For each time of eating, 

GALAXY 



each adult might scale off a bowlful 
of food. There were three of these 
times of eating during each time of 
ligSt. No one ate or drank during 
the dark time. 

But they did enjoy the little space 
when the light changed to dark, and 
the tiny bright points slowly came 
into view in the sky overhead. Then 
came the coolness, and sometimes a 
gentle wind. Everyone sat at the 
mouths of burrows, sat quietly and 
talked softly, and remembered again 
the refreshing bowl of water each 
had drunk. 

He sat with his mother. But he 
could not sit still for long. He 
played about on the cooling sand, 
scampering here and there, trying to 
coax other young to scamper with 
him. But a word from their parents, 
and other small ones sat obediently. 
Only he went farther and farther out 
into the pleasant-scented dark. 

There was a reason for this wan- 
dering. Every day he remembered 
the thought that he had had. It was 
no accident that his wandering took 
him closer and closer to the Pool. 
And he learned that when he went 
softly no one noticed him at all. 

The dark was not really dark. 
The many bright points overhead 
caused a gentle glow, and when the 
big light came, as it often did, he 
could see far out across the sand. 
The Pool would glitter, and the dark 
bulk of the Rock would show 
clearly. 

“The little lights are stars,” his 
mother said. “They have always 

THE ROCK AND THE POOL 



been there, just as the sand and the 
Rock and the Pool have always 
been here.” 

“The big light is not always 
there. Sometimes it comes, some- 
times it does not. What is it?” 

“I only know that it is called the 
Moon.” 

“Why should it be called the 
Moon? Why is it there? I want to 
know more about these things.” 

“How?” His mother smiled 
gently at her different, puzzling 
son. “It is not possible. It is better 
to sit and enjoy the coolness, and to 
remember the water you have 
drunk.” 

He did not ask more. It disturbed 
his mother. But the things that he 
did not know came again and again 
into his mind. And he saw no 
reason why one bowl of water 
should be enough. 

One night, when there was no 
Moon, he reached the Pool. The 
light was dim. His little feet made 
no sound in the fine sand. He could 
see a watcher sitting, a slumped, 
shadowy shape. And, when he lis- 
tened carefully, he could hear soft 
bubbling snores. 

The water felt cool when he 
thrust in a small hand. The air 
around the Pool held a grateful 
chill. He wished for his bowl, so 
that he might drink. When he raised 
his wet hand, it dripped. Drops 
clung to the fingers. With sudden 
understanding he licked them off, 
then thrust in his hand again. He 
did not need a bowl to drink water. 



133 



Again and again he licked his 
fingers. The water was delicious. 
And he soon found that he could 
curve his fingers, hold them to- 
gether, and dip out water as though 
his hand were a small bowl. He 
drank until he was satisfied. For the 
first time in his brief life he had 
enough. As he slipped back past the 
sleeping watcher, he knew that he 
would come again — and then again. 
He did not believe that one small 
being could cause any change in the 
Pool. 

With the extra water, he slept 
deeply. When he woke, the world 
seemed brighter than it ever had be- 
fore. He was always busy, but this 
light time he was busier than ever. 
His mother watched him with mild 
amazement. But she was proud. No 
burrow in the living world, in all 
the space around the Rock and the 
Pool, had such an active, bright- 
eyed son. 

The bowl of food seemed very 
small. He drank the mixture his 
mother had made, sipping it slowly, 
and savoring every mouthful. His 
little rudimentary teeth crunched on 
clinging flakes of the sweet stuff 
that his mother had placed in the 
water. He didn’t know that it had 
been hundreds of generations since 
those teeth had been needed. Al- 
ways, so far as anyone knew, there 
had been only the food from the 
Rock and the water from the Pool. 

“I would like more food,” he 
told his mother. 

“You have had your bowlful. It 



is the amount all young of your 
birth time have eaten. No one ever 
has more.” 

‘‘You could go again to the 
Rock. There is more there.” 

“There would not be, if all had 
more than one bowl.” 

“But I don’t speak of more for 
everyone. Only me.” 

His mother regarded him with 
complete astonishment. Her tiny 
figure, always so frail and bent, 
straightened. Her little eyes glowed. 
Her soft voice was almost stem as 
she said: 

“What is right for one is right for 
all. That has always been true. 
Never forget that, my son. And that 
is why each has only one bowl.” 

He would have liked to talk more 
about these things. He knew that all 
of the food on the Rock was never 
eaten. Much of it was too high for 
even the tallest adult to reach. Oc- 
casionally a great scale of it fell 
from above, and, when broken up 
with a stone, was enough to fill 
many bowls. This he knew, for his 
mother had told him. But even then 
no one had more than one bowl. It 
wasn’t done. 

So he said, “Yes, mother,” and 
went out to play in the shadows 
thrown by the scattered boulders. 
No one stayed long in the hot rays 
of the sun. But he knew what he 
would do. What was possible at the 
Pool would be possible at the Rock. 
The watching would be no better. 
And, with the coming of the dark 
time, he proved it. 



134 



GALAXY 



It was easy to pull the small flat 
scales of food from the Rock with 
his slender fingers. There was no 
water, so he crunched them with his 
barely emergent teeth. It seemed to 
him that he had never before known 
sweetness. 

He ate slowly, and did not pull 
all the scales from one spot. He 
noticed that when he removed the 
food, the Rock underneath was 
rough and wet. The wetness had the 
sweetness and the taste of the food 
when he licked it from his fingers. 
When he had eaten, eaten more 
than in all his life before, the need 
for water became very great. He 
circled the Rock, kept to the darkest 
shadows, and came to the Pool and 
drank. 

All night his small belly roiled 
and pained, and his dreams made 
him cry out. Not enough food was 
not good, but too much food was 
no better. He learned a great deal 
that night. At the first time of eat- 
ing of the new day, he would not 
take his bowl. 

“You eat it,” he told his mother. 
“I will only have the water.” 

That certainly had never hap- 
pened before. She worried and 
fussed over him, while he still lay on 
his little bed of fibers against the 
cool wall. But by the second time 
of eating he took his bowl of food 
again, and then ran out to play in 
the boulder shadows. 

★ ★ ★ 



He grew. It seemed to him that 
his mother was becoming smaller 
and smaller. Home was shrinking. 
His bed was soon too short and 
where once he could walk into the 
burrow’s opening, now he had to 
crawl again. It was bewildering, 
and after he had noticed it, he 
thought and brooded about it. 

Then he knew. All these things 
were not becoming smaller. He was 
getting bigger. Much bigger. He 
was growing, and growing very 
fast. And when he thought, he 
knew why. Each night now, each 
time of darkness, he stayed for long 
outside the burrow. He told his 
mother that he liked to watch the 
stars. Then, when all was quiet, he 
made his nightly visit to the Rock 
and to the Pool. 

He had learned to eat sparingly. 
He drank only enough water to 
make the food feel good inside him. 
But while every other individual 
had three sparse bowlfuls of food 
each light period and a bowl of 
water after each, he had four times 
of eating, and at the last one he got 
all his growing body needed. Of all 
the beings in the world, only he got 
enough to eat. 

During the time of the Moon it 
was harder. Then there was light all 
during the star time, and he had to 
be very careful. There was always a 
chance that one of the watchers 
would waken. But none ever did. 
There had not really been a need for 
watchers for generations. So they 
slept soundly. 



THE ROCK AND THE POOL 



135 



Then came the day of the strange 
happening. The oldest adult had 
never seen its like, though there 
were stories, dim ancestral 
memories, of a time when such 
things often occurred. Then the 
world had been a different place, 
and each one had had all the water 
he wanted or required. 

It had been a time of unusual 
brightness, of great heat. It was not 
comfortable to play in the boulder 
shadows. He lay panting in the bur- 
row mouth, for there was not even 
a hot breeze sweeping across the 
shimmering sand. He thought long- 
ingly of a cool bowl of water. The 
Pool was out there, in plain sight, 
the water glistening in the hot sun- 
shine. Every being had need of 
drink. But no one even thought of 
taking water yet. Custom could not 
be broken. The next bowl of water 
was not allowed until the light 
began to fade. 

Quite suddenly the darkness 
came, but there were no stars. The 
brightness of the sky was covered 
over with strange, moving, rolling 
masses, sweeping lower and lower. 
Then the hot wind started, and it 
picked up the sand and blew it ev- 
erywhere, so that it stung and 
burned, and filled noses and eyes. It 
was terrifying. His now tiny mother 
fled into the depths of the burrow, 
and lay trembling on her bed. But 
somehow it did not frighten him. 

He crawled out of the burrow and 
stood tall, taller than the tallest 
adult, though he was still very 

136 



young. He turned his back to the 
wind-driven, stinging sand. This 
was a new thing, and it seemed to 
him that everyone should be out, 
should be watching. But none were. 
Against the blowing sand and the 
dark masses overhead, only he 
moved. 

Then the water fell. In the space 
of half a dozen breaths his skin was 
wet. All around him the sand turned 
dark. The wind no longer blew it. 
He stood, frightened now, and the 
water drenched him. It came down 
so thickly that he could not see the 
Pool, and the Rock was only an in- 
distinct something through the driv- 
ing drops. Even the sand could not 
drink it as fast as it came down. It 
ran in streamlets everywhere, carry- 
ing the sand, and washing paths for 
itself. And every depression in 
every glistening rock and boulder 
was filled to the brim. 

“I may die,” he told himself, 
“but I will not go in. This is some- 
thing no being ever saw before. No 
one can even imagine too much wa- 
ter. But this is too much.” 

From the heat of the bright af- 
ternoon, the air was now chill. He, 
whose skin had never before been 
wet, shivered, and his tiny short 
teeth chattered. He really thought 
that he might die, but he stubbornly 
stayed and watched. He crouched 
behind a boulder near the burrow 
mouth, and there the wind was less. 
The rock was wet and cold. 

The brief, vagrant desert storm 
actually lasted only a few minutes. 

GALAXY 



He could not know how capri- 
ciously such storms struck, how little 
space they covered. He could not 
know that it was only chance that 
had kept them from this small spot 
for the length of the life span of 
many beings. 

The dark clouds overhead drifted 
on. The sky brightened. Warmth 
came again. He stood in the hottest 
spot he could find, and quickly his 
skin dried. Everywhere thick steamy 
vapors rose from the wet sand. 

Cautiously neighbors began to 
peer from burrow mouths. 

“Come out,” he called. “The 
world is wet. There is water for ev- 
eryone, and to drink it will not 
make the Pool less.” 

He sipped rain water from a de- 
pression in a boulder. It was cold 
and good. 

One by one, then in groups and 
families, the beings came out. They 
walked gingerly on the cool wet 
sand. They did not believe the 
water in the puddles and depres- 
sions. But as he had done, they 
dipped in fingers and tasted. There 
was no custom to tell them not to 
drink this water. So everyone drank 
until they all were full. Never be- 
fore had each had all the water he 
wanted. 

It was a passing thing. Quickly 
the hot sun dried the sand. One by 
one the puddles vanished. The 
water-filled depressions became 
simply wet spots on the rocks, and 
these soon went away. But it was 
wonderful while it lasted. In the 



twilights to come, all would re- 
member and speak of the day when 
each one had had all the cool water 
he could drink. 

★ ★ ★ 

When the light began to grow 
less each adult took his bowl and 
went to the Rock for food. Even 
though they were filled with water, 
they followed custom. Twilight was 
the day’s last time of eating. 

At first they did not understand 
what they found. With puzzlement 
they milled around the wet and 
shining Rock, lifting far higher into 
the hot air than the tallest boulder. 
For the first time in memory they 
could really see it, see the uneven 
porous sides of it, with little drop- 
lets oozing out and trickling down- 
ward here and there. So long had 
they gone through the motions of 
plucking the sweet scales from the 
Rock that some even tried it, 
though their eyes told them that 
there were none to pluck. 

And finally, from one old female 
who carried two bowls, the wail of 
realization rang out: 

“There is no food!” 

While he was now larger than the 
largest adult, he was still a juvenile. 
He had not yet lived long enough to 
be allowed to carry his own bowl to 
the Rock and fill it. So his little 
mother carried his bowl, just as she 
had since he first had begun to eat. 
He stood far away with the small 
ones, waiting. From where he stood 
he could see that the Rock was dif- 

137 



THE ROCK AND THE POOL 



ferent. The scales no longer hung 
there in sweet clusters, building into 
large darkening chunks high on the 
Rock, where no being could reach. 
There were no scales at all. But. the 
Rock still glistened with wetness, 
while all thp boulders about, and 
the sand itself had long since dried. 

His mother came back slowly 
with the empty bowls. She was 
stunned, mute, pathetic. Her world 
had collapsed. Water had fallen 
from the sky, and there was no 
longer food on the Rock. 

“We will die,” she whimpered. 
“I could get no food for you. There 
is none on the Rock. I do not un- 
derstand, but I know we will die.” 
“We are not dead,” he soothed 
her, “and we have had much water. 
Perhaps the water will be enough.” 
“No one can live without food,” 
she said. “No one ever has.” 

“Get us water from the Pool,” 
he suggested. “We have no food to 
pour it over, but we can sip it in the 
cool evening, when the stars show. 
It will be pleasant.” 

Unlike any other being in the 
colony around the Pool and the 
Rock, he was thinking. He had bro- 
ken custom so often that he could 
better adjust to change. He was bet- 
ter nourished, and his thoughts were 
keener. He remembered what hap- 
pened when water was poured over 
food. 

“The food goes away,” he told 
himself. “It becomes a part of the 
water, and the water grows sweet 
like the food.” 

138 



He sat and studied the Rock, still 
glistening wet in the last rays of the 
sun. 

“The water fell from the sky. 
Much water. It poured on the Rock, 
and on the food. The food became a 
part of the water, and the sand 
drank it as it flowed away. That is 
why there is no food on the Rock.” 

Late in the dark time, when all 
the hungry members of the colony 
were finally asleep, he crept from 
the burrow and made his now famil- 
iar way to the Rock. There was a 
poft star-glow. The Moon was a 
thin sliver low in the sky. He had 
other thoughts about the Rock, 
thoughts no other being had. He 
wondered where the food came 
from. When the scales were 
plucked, always more came in their 
places. Under the scales the Rock 
was always wet. And the water was 
sweet, like the sweetness of the 
food. 

He remembered these things as 
he came to the Rock again. His 
mind ached with all the things he 
was thinking, with the effort to un- 
derstand. He put a finger on the wet 
Rock, then put the wetness in his 
mouth. As always, it was sweet. 
But his probing hands felt some- 
thing else, something far more ex- 
citing. All over the Rock small 
scales were growing. They were 
very thin, and broke if he touched 
them, but they were there all the 
same. And they tasted just as the 
food had always tasted. The food 
was coming back on the Rock! No 

GALAXY 



one would starve after all. 

He ate, picking the tiny scales 
carefully, working his way all 
around the Rock. He would have 
liked to take some to his mother, 
but he knew he could not. He was 
not supposed to go near the Rock at 
all. He was too young. And no one 
took food in the dark time. It 
wasn’t done. 

He had a drink from the Pool, 
then finally went back to his bed. 
Across the small cool room his 
mother whimpered softly as she 
slept. He thought harder than he 
ever had thought before. 

“When I spill water on a stone, 
it soon goes away. The stone is dry 
again. Is the food a part of the 
water on the Rock? And when the 
water goes away, the food stays?” 

He puzzled until his head ached, 
but just as he finally slipped into 
sleep, a more troublesome question 
drifted through his mind. “Why is 
the Rock always wet? Where does 
the water come from ?” 

He did not know that only one 
other being of all the colony had 
ever asked that question. 

It had been two days. Two sun- 
times and two dark times for sleep. 
The food had come back to the 
Rock. The scales grew faster than 
the filled bowls could carry them 
away. Each being had his accus- 
tomed amount. He had even per- 
suaded his mother to use a larger 
bowl for him, for she could see 
with her eyes that he needed it. And 
still there was more than enough. 

THE ROCK AND THE POOL 



“All should eat more,” he told 
his mother. “There is more on the 
Rock, and no one ever really gets 
enough. It was pleasant when we 
had all the water we could drink.” 

But his mother shook her small 
head. 

“It has never been done. One 
bowl is enough. That way we al- 
ways have food.” 

“There is food high on the Rock 
that no one can reach. It could feed 
many more. There should be a way 
to gather it.” 

“There is no way. When the 
scales grow heavy and fall, then 
they can be eaten. This is the way it 
has always been.” 

His eyes gleamed. 

‘ ‘If I could think of a way to pick 
the scales higher up, would the 
neighbors agree? Why shouldn’t 
they be picked?” 

Again she shook her head, but 
she seemed bewildered. She loved 
her big son, but he was disturbing. 
No one had ever thought the things 
he thought. 

“It has never been done. The 
way we do it is best, for we have 
always done it this way. And you 
are too young even to go near the 
Rock. I do not know why you are 
so large.” 

He might have insisted, but 
another strange happening caught 
his attention soon after the water 
fell from the sky. Most beings 
looked on with a dull wonder, but 
he was fascinated. 

All around the burrows, and far 

139 



and near over the bright hot land, 
tiny gre$n things pushed their way 
up out of the sand. They did not 
move about, but like the scales of 
food on the Rock, they grew larger. 

“What are they?” he asked his 
mother. “I have never seen them 
before. What do they do? Are they 
food?” 

“I do not know what they are,” 
his mother said. “I have never seen 
them either. But they are not food. 
Food comes only from the Rock. 
This we all know.” 

She hesitated. He could see that 
she wanted to say something more. 

“Across the colony, far beyond 
the Rock, there is a boulder that 
shines red in the light. Under the 
shelving edge of the boulder there is 
a burrow. By it, in the boulder’s 
shade, there will be sitting a Very 
Old One. His head hair will be long 
and shaggy, and it and everything 
about him will be gray. Ask him. 
He has lived a long time.” 

She was silent, but he knew she 
was not finished. And finally she 
added: 

“Say that you have come from 
me, and that you are my son. I 
once knew him very well.” 

She had forgotten, or perhaps she 
didn’t know, how widely he wan- 
dered and strayed as he played from 
one boulder shade to the next. And 
certainly she knew nothing of his 
stealthy prowling in the starshine, 
when all were supposed to be in 
their beds. He knew the red boulder 
well, and had often watched the 

140 



slowmoving Old One as he sat in 
the shade, sometimes dozing, some- 
times staring into the distance at 
nothing. He had been curious, too. 
In all the colony there was no one 
so slow and gray and wrinkled. 

The green things speckled the 
sand, making a pleasing sight in the 
morning light. It was after the early 
food bowl, and he had had his wa- 
ter. He ran rapidly from shade to 
shade, pausing in each patch for a 
moment as he had been taught. 
Only thus could living beings move 
about in the hot light. 

He could see the red boulder 
from far off. It was early, but al- 
ready the oldster was sitting out 
against the stone, sitting quietly in 
the edge of the cool shadow. His 
wrinkled hands held an old, worn 
water bowl. The faded old eyes 
looked at him with an unexpected 
keenness when he darted into the 
Old One’s shadow patch. 

“You are the Large One,” the 
Old One said. “I have heard much 
of you. And I have seen you in the 
distance.” 

“I like to play in many shadows. 
My mother says there is no harm in 
it, if I do not disturb other burrows. 
Do I disturb you?” 

The ancient eyes regarded him 
tranquilly. The bowl was twirled 
slowly in the old fingers. It still 
held a little water. The Old One 
raised it, and took a satisfying sip. 

“Nothing disturbs me. I have 
known everything, seen everything. 
Now it is good to sit, and watch the 

GALAXY 



world, and sip a little water. — And 
to remember. I have many things to 
remember.” 

“My mother sent me. She said 
you would know her name.” 

The Old One nodded. 

“I remember. She was the last. 
The last of many. She was a good 
being. She always followed the 
rules. She never asked why.” 

“Is it wrong to ask why?” 

“Who is to say what is wrong? 
But to ask why is to think. Most be- 
ings do not wish to think. To think 
is to worry. And to worry is to be 
unhappy.” 

The young one sprawled in the 
shadow, on the cool sand. Even 
lying prone he could almost look 
the Old One in the eye. 

“I always ask why,” he said. It 
does not make me unhappy.” 

“You must have asked why you 
could not have more food. You 
could not have grown so large on 
only one bowl.” 

“My mother only gives me one 
bowl.” 

“I know.” The old eyes were 
wise and cunning, and the wrinkled 
face shaped itself into a grin. “You 
are the shadow that creeps around 
the Rock in the starshine, when the 
watchers sleep. I sleep little, and I 
see much.” 

He did not deny. He could tell 
that the Old One did not disap- 
prove. He suspected that, if he had 
thought of it when he was young, 
the Old One might have done as he 
had. 



“All the food is never eaten,” he 
said. “Others could have more than 
one bowl. When I am older, and 
may go to the Rock in the light, I 
can reach food no one now eats. I 
do not think it is wrong not to be 
hungry.” 

‘ ‘There was a reason for the. cus- 
tom,” the Old One said. “Perhaps 
it was not a good reason. But it has 
kept the colony alive. No one 
starves.” 

“If we could gather food all the 
way to the top of the Rock, ev- 
eryone would have plenty. When 
the food is taken, more grows back. 
We should be able to reach it all.” 

“I have thought of that,” the Old 
One admitted, “but there is no 
way. It was never meant to be.” 

“This is what my mother says. 1 
cannot understand why. I will think 
of a way.” 

“You might. So far as I know 
you are the first to try.” 

The Old One leaned back against 
the stone. Suddenly he seemed 
tired. He sipped a few drops from 
the bowl. 

“Why did your mother send you 
to me? Tell me, before I am too 
weary.” 

“The little green things. Nothing 
like them has ever happened before. 
She said you might know what they 
are.” 

The Old one nodded. His old 
eyes had a far-away look. 

“Yes, I know. This is not the 
first time they have come. I have 
seen them twice in my lifetime. 

HI 



THE ROCK AND THE POOL 



They come only after water falls 
from the sky. Then for a little while 
the sand is wet, and they grow out 
of it. I think they are alive.” 

“They cannot move. Only the 
wind blows them.” 

“Yet, somehow, they drink wa- 
ter. They get it from the sand, 
while it is still wet. Then they 
grow, a few light periods only, and 
colored parts, very pleasant to the 
eyes, come on their tops. After that 
they will turn brown and die.” 

“But — of what use are they?” 

The Old One shrugged thin, 
scrawny shoulders. 

“Of what use are we?” 

That was a strange answer. He 
thought of it, while the Old One 
leaned back against the boulder and 
closed his eyes. 

“Go now. I must sleep a little. 
And tell your mother I remember.” 

★ ★ ★ 

For the next few light periods he 
watched the green things. As the 
Old One had said, they grew 
rapidly. But they were still tiny and 
frail. The slightest wind bent them. 
And when he tried to take one out 
of the sand, it broke in his hands, 
and green juice came on his fingers. 
He tried to put it back into the 
sand, but in a little while it was 
only a dried brown wisp, and the 
wind blew it away. 

The colored parts came, reds and 
pinks and yellows. Some were even 
white. For a brief while it was a 

142 



most pleasant thing to look out 
across the hot sand and see the 
many bits of color all rippling in the 
wind. Then they faded, and the 
green things grew brown and died. 

He was distressed. 

“Will they ever come again?” 
He asked the Old One. After that 
first visit he came back again and 
again to the red boulder, and to the 
old gray being who sat in the shade 
that it made. 

“They will come. But before 
they do the water must fall again 
from the sky. And as you know, 
this happens only once or twice in a 
being’s lifetime. Live long, then, 
and perhaps you will see them 
again.” 

“Where do they come from? I 
have dug in the sand. There are 
none there. And how can they 
drink? They have no mouths.” 

The Old One’s pale eyes looked 
at the big youngster with approval. 

“You wish to know. That is 
good. Most beings do not care. All 
they wish is food from the Rock, 
water from the Pool, and, when 
they have grown, another being to 
share a burrow with them. There 
should be more than that.” 

“But how can I know, when no 
one knows? Even you do not know 
where the green things come 
from.” 

“You can look for yourself, as 
you have been doing. It is in my 
head, from something I knew long 
ago, that the green things grow 
from small pieces that are hard to 

GALAXY 



see and that are mixed with the 
sand. I do not know where they 
came from. Perhaps you can dis- 
cover. Then you can instruct me.” 

And it was because he followed 
that advice, and looked and sifted 
the sand, that he found the green 
thing that was just beginning to 
grow. It did not look like the 
others. It sat in the shade of a boul- 
der for most of the light time, and 
so was not dried up by the sun’s 
fierce rays. It lifted on a sturdy col- 
umn, and spread flat green pieces 
on all sides of it. For a time it 
flourished. Then it, too, began to 
wilt. 

He agonized. 

“Why must it die? It has made 
no colored parts. It should live 
longer. It is pleasant to see it there, 
digging down into the sand, reach- 
ing up into the light. Why can’t I 
help it?” 

He thought long, sitting in boul- 
der shade almost as quietly as the 
Old One himself. He remembered 
the Old One sipping water from his 
bowl, a few drops only, and being 
refreshed in the hot air. He thought 
again of how the green things had 
come only after the water had fall- 
en, and of how short a time they 
had lived in the dry sand. Now this 
different green thing, larger than the 
others had ever grown, would die. 

“If it still had water, it would not 
die. It is water that makes life go 
on.” 

And he knew how he could help. 
He knew what he would do. 



When the light faded, after he 
and his mother had enjoyed their 
water in the cool shadows by the 
burrow entrance, he slipped away. 
The glow of starshine had become 
his favorite light. He spent more 
time out in it than any being had for 
many generations. Even though it 
was cooler, more pleasant, for some 
reason the dark time was for sleep. 
It was custom. And, until he came 
along, few beings failed to follow 
custom. What was done was best, 
because it had always been done 
that way. 

He had not placed his water bowl 
back in the bunrow. Now he went 
stealthily but swiftly to the Pool, 
and filled it to the brim. Carefully 
he carried it to the wilting green 
thing. 

“Every living thing may have 
one bowl,” he told himself. “This 
thing lives. It is right that it too 
should have one bowl.” 

He studied it once again in the 
dim light. He hesitated. He did not 
know how to give the water to it. 

“It has no mouth. I do not un- 
derstand how it drinks. But if I drop 
the water on it from above, that will 
be like the water falls from the sky. 
Perhaps it will help.” 

So, gently, drop by drop, he 
poured until the bowl was empty. 
The water ran off the flat green 
pieces, and the sand grew dark with 
wetness. 

“It likes the wet sand. Now 
perhaps it will not die.” 

When the bright time came again, 

143 



THE ROCK AND THE POOL 



he could scarcely wait until the 
early bowl of food was finished. He 
ate with a rush. His small mother 
watched him with grave concern. 

“You are not yet old enough,” 
she said, “but I think your food 
bowl should be still bigger. An 
adult bowl. No being has ever been 
your size before, but it is only right 
that you should be fed. I will speak 
to the neighbors, for that is custom. 
But you shall have the bowl.” 

He did not tell her that his haste 
was not caused by hunger. She 
would not understand his concern 
about the green thing. And certainly 
it would not be well to say anything 
about the water. He ate enough in 
the dark time to satisfy his needs, 
but he would be glad of the larger 
bowl. Soon, he hoped, he would be 
permitted to gather his own food 
from the Rock. 

So he finished his food more 
slowly, then sipped the water his 
mother brought. It was custom that 
he must sit quietly, enjoying, re- 
membering, while his mother took 
her water. She sipped daintily, with 
long pauses, looking out toward the 
Rock and the Pool, and over the hot 
sand into the distance beyond. This 
was the world. This was what be- 
ings did, and his mother could not 
even imagine anything more. But 
finally she had the last drop. He 
was free to go and play in the boul- 
der shadows. 

The green thing was happier. The 
flat green pieces no longer drooped. 
It lifted its tip higher, and he fan- 

144 



cied that it had grown during the 
star time. Around its base, where it 
emerged from the sand, the dark- 
ness of where he had spilled the 
water still showed. It was wet and 
cool to his probing fingers. 

“It will live. If I give it water it 
will grow, and that will be very 
pleasant. I do not think so small an 
amount of water will harm the 
Pool.” 

There was no one to whom he 
could talk, no one who saw any- 
thing wonderful about this thing 
which had no use. No one, that is, 
except the Old One. And if he 
spoke to him, the wise wrinkled old 
being would know about the water. 
But perhaps that would not matter. 
Perhaps the Old One would not 
care. He might even think that this 
was a thing worth doing, though it 
was not custom. 

The Old One sat in his boulder 
shade. He seemed older and more 
wrinkled than he ever had before. 
He lay against the rock, his eyes 
closed, his breath whispering drily 
through the thin lips. His water 
bowl rested on his knees. There was 
no water in it. 

“It is a pleasant light time, Old 
One.” 

The eyelids fluttered. The voice 
was a thin rasp. 

“Not for me. I am now too tired 
to enjoy, Large One.” 

The big juvenile looked at the dry 
bowl. 

“You have had your water. It is 
not yet the hot time. This is the best 



GALAXY 



part of the time of waking.” 

The old eyes opened, but they 
seemed glazed and unseeing. 

‘‘I have had no water. Since the 
last light time I have not been able 
to walk to the Pool. My life is al- 
most over. ’ ’ 

He was deeply disturbed. He now 
knew what the Old One reminded 
him of. He was like the green 
thing, wilting and drying in the 
thirsty air. Soon he would grow 
brown, and blow away in the wind. 

“But you must have your water! 
A bowl with food, a bowl to sip. 
Every being has this right.” 

The Old One smiled faintly. 
“When the being no longer can 
go to the Pool and to the Rock, he 
dies. This is custom. Others, like 
you, grow up and drink the water.” 
The big young one rose to his 
feet, moving swiftly. No being in 
the colony was his equal for size 
and strength. 

“Give me your bowl! I have bro- 
ken custom often before, and 1 will 
bring you water. It is only right.” 
“You are not old enough to dip. 
The watchers will not allow it.” 

“I will show your bowl. They 
will know it is for you.” 

“Each being must dip his own 
bowl, unless he is still too young. 
This is custom. It has always been 
so. That way, the Pool always has 
water.” 

But the young one reached and 
took the bowl from the wrinkled, 
claw-like hand. The hand was as 
dry as sand. 

THE ROCK AND THE POOL 



“Soon you will have water,” he 
promised, and darted for the next 
boulder shadow. 

At the Pool he showed the bowl 
to the watcher. 

“This is the Old One’s bowl. He 
is dying because he has no water. I 
must dip for him.” 

“You are too young. Your 
mother still dips for you. The Old 
One must dip his own bowl. This 
has always been so.” 

“But he cannot walk. And with- 
out the water he will die.” 

“Everything dies,” the watcher 
said. 

The big young one raised himself 
to his full height. He looked down 
on the top of the head of the star- 
tled watcher. 

“While we talk, the Old One 
dies. I will dip his bowl and take 
him water, because I am larger than 
you. That way, I will make a new 
custom.” 

He strode firmly down to the 
edge of the Pool, dipped the bowl, 
and filled it to the brim. Then, car- 
rying carefully, he made his way 
from shadow to shadow back to the 
red boulder where the Old One lay. 
The watcher stared after him, but 
did nothing. Custom did not cover 
this situation. In his memory, noth- 
ing like it had ever happened be- 
fore. 

The large juvenile crouched be- 
side the small shriveled figure of 
the Old One and held the bowl to 
his lips. The old fellow swallowed 
weakly, ran out his dry tongue. 

145 



Then he clutched the bowl with 
eager hands and drank. 

When the bowl was half emptied, 
the Old One lowered it carefully to 
his knees. Even in this time of 
weakness and dire necessity he did 
not spill a drop. He lay quietly for a 
few minutes. His breath no longer 
wheezed drily from his throat. 
When his eyes opened they were no 
longer glazed. 

“This was not custom,” he said. 

‘ ‘Others are growing larger. If I live 
beyond my time, I am drinking 
their water. You have done a good 
thing, but you must let me die. 1 do 
not think I can ever go to the Pool 
again.” 

“There is plenty of water. When 
I dipped for you, I saw the Pool for 
the first time in the light. It is a 
single hollow in one great stone. Its 
edges are smooth and worn, but 
there is no rock like it anywhere 
around the colony. It is deep, and 
bubbles rise without stopping from 
its middle.” 

The Old One nodded. 

“Like the food on the Rock, it 
replaces itself when we drink. I 
have long thought that it would be 
possible to have more than one 
bowl. But custom has always said 
one bowl. All beings think this. 
And we have had enough, and have 
stayed alive.” 

He squatted in the shadow beside 
the slight, thin figure, and thought. 
Then he said: 

“In the starshine I have long had 
more than one bowl. And at the 

146 



Rock I have eaten until I am filled. 
There is still much food no one can 
reach. There is always more water 
in the Pool. I think custom is 
wrong.” 

“You are only one, and it has 
made you large. If all ate and drank 
more, there might not be enough.” 

“We should use what there is. 
More will come. And I have won- 
dered why.” 

The Old One settled back against 
his boulder. He sipped again from 
his bowl. He looked very old and 
tired, but he seemed content. 

“I have waited for you. I also 
have asked why, but there was no 
way to know. Perhaps you will find 
one. When you are old, you will 
have more to remember than I do 
now.” 

The big young one rose. 

“Give me your food bowl. I will 
fill it at the Rock. Each light time I 
will fill your bowls, and you can 
tell me all the things you have seen 
and done, and the thoughts you 
have had. When I am old I will tell 
these things to other young who ask 
why. And I will tell them your 
name, so they will know that you 
have lived.” 

The Old One sighed with pure 
pleasure. 

“That will be a good exchange. I 
will enjoy it. But the neighbors will 
not understand. No young has ever 
filled an old one’s bowls. It is not 
custom.” 

“When I dipped your water, we 
made a new custom. We can make 

GALAXY 



more, because I am the biggest 
being in the colony. What we do 
will become what others should do. 
And you can make sure that what 
we do is wise.” 

The Old One sipped, and shook 
his head with wonder. 

‘‘I am glad to have lived so long. 

I will think the best thoughts that I 
can. When 1 die, I will die with 
content. And now, for a time, let 
me rest. Then I can take the food.” 

★ ★ if 

There was much quiet talk in the 
twilight times, neighbor to 
neighbor, while the last food bowl 
was eaten, the last water sipped. 
The talk was of the Large One, and 
how he gathered and carried the 
bowls of the Old One. Suddenly the 
big juvenile seemed young no 
longer. He had become a Force, 
ominous and different. He did not 
respect custom. Things were no 
longer as they had always been. His 
simple neighbors were frightened. 

“Speak to your son,” they told 
his mother. “A son always listens 
to his mother. Tell him that if we 
do not follow custom we will all 
die. The water and the food will be 
used up.” 

“I have spoken to him. He is 
kind, but he will not listen any 
more. He says that he makes new 
customs, and that they are better. 
He tells me to have two bowls of 
water, if one does not fill me. He 
says there will be enough.” 

THE ROCK AND THE POOL 



“The Old One should have died. 
For him, it is time. He can only sit 
in the shadow, and your son brings 
him water. If he cannot dip for 
himself, it is not his water any 
longer. He is drinking the water of 
the small growing ones, and the 
new bom.” 

The tiny wizened mother sipped 
her water. Secretly, she thought that 
it had never been more refreshing. 
This was her son, and the whole 
colony was speaking of him. Every 
being knew her son. 

“He says' that the Old One 
knows more than other beings. He 
says that he must listen to it all, so 
that nothing will be lost.” 

“Every being knows the Rock 
and the Pool, the light and the heat 
and the shadows, darkness and star- 
shine. All know the pleasures of 
coolness and water, and compan- 
ionship in the burrow, and talk with 
neighbors in the twilight. This is the 
world. There is nothing else to 
know.” 

“He speaks of the water falling 
from the sky, and where the green 
things come from, and why the 
Pool always has water. He says 
there is something else far across 
the sand that no being has ever 
seen. He says the Old One thinks of 
many things no one has thought be- 
fore.” 

“These are mysteries. They can- 
not be known. And anyway, they 
have nothing to do with life. Our 
concern is only with enough food, 
enough water, and shelter from the 

147 



heat. If these are taken away, we 
die. If we follow custom, we will 
always have them.” 

The little mother sipped from her 
bowl, and blinked her mild eyes. 

“I will speak to him again, but I 
do not believe he will listen. He 
thinks his own thoughts. Also, he 
listens to the Old One, who remem- 
bers more than any other being. 
They do strange things, but they 
will not cause us to die.” 

She sipped again, crouched on 
the sand strip before her burrow en- 
trance. She lifted her small head. 
She was the mother of the Large 
One, and she was proud. 

The neighbors found nothing 
more to say. 

* * * 

At the flick of a switch the big 
screen lighted. Colors grew on it. 
The landscape it showed was an 
empty wasteland, a stark, lifeless 
expanse of sand and boulders on 
which the sun beat with a relentless 
intensity. Heat seemed to radiate 
from the screen. 

The Professor shuddered. It was 
almost as if some ancestral memory 
stirred, and the heat was real, des- 
sicating and shriveling the tissues, 
the very air stealing moisture from 
the lung linings at each breath. The 
Professor glanced away from the 
screen for a moment. Through the 
wide laboratory windows big 
spruces and firs spread cool, grate- 
ful shade. Behind them rose the 

148 



peaks, some covered with new 
snow. The Professor took a deep 
breath of the pungent, spicy air. 

From over the desk the entry 
gong sounded its deep tone. Three 
beats, a pause, one more beat. A 
student. A graduate student wishing 
a conference. 

Although it was an important part 
of the chair she occupied, the Pro- 
fessor did not particularly enjoy the 
work with graduate students. It 
seemed to her that the quality de- 
teriorated with each new hatching. 
They were all so ambitious, so ear- 
nest, so unimaginative — so dull! 
She preferred the clean, incisive 
path of her own research, unclut- 
tered by bumbling and by straying 
off onto pointless bypaths. She en- 
joyed the smooth working of what 
was admittedly the best mind on the 
planet — her own. 

Still, there was one student who 
almost seemed worth the trouble. 
He was mature. He thought well. 
He recognized the importance of 
background and context. He devised 
his own approaches, implemented 
them with imagination, analysed his 
data with insight. Yes, definitely a 
possibility. He wanted more than a 
doctorate. He wanted to know. 

She glanced back at the screen. 
She knew that the picture on it was 
not chance. She was supervising a 
dozen projects, but this was the one 
most on her mind. And not, she 
admitted honestly, entirely because 
of the research itself. The Professor 
was at the height of her powers. 

GALAXY 



Mentally, physically, she would 
never be better. She felt that she 
owed her race — and herself — 
something more than the classic 
monographs that set her apart from 
even the best in her field. 

She was not sure which student 
waited outside the portal, but the 
gong had rung with a crisp preci- 
sion. She thought she recognized 
the touch. So, even though this was 
the day she usually reserved for 
herself, she reached for the entry 
button. Then she paused. She 
swung a great mirror around before 
her couch and inspected herself crit- 
ically. 

She flared her blue, many-spined 
crest. She intensified the rosy red of 
her pulsing, graceful throat, 
polished an imaginary cloudy spot 
from a green breast-scale with a bit 
of fluff. Her almost lidless golden 
eyes softened. Her appearance was 
satisfactory. Perhaps it even 
matched the attractiveness of her 
brain. 

She swung back the mirror, 
touched the entry button. When the 
portal opened she was sitting decor- 
ously on her couch, her tail coiled 
around the desk as it always was 
when she was working, gravely 
studying the stark beauty of the des- 
ert landscape on the screen. 

She did not turn her head as he 
strode quickly across the laboratory. 
She could feel him as he loomed 
behind her, looking at the screen 
over her shoulder. Her nostrils flut- 
tered briefly at the musky male 

THE ROCK AND THE POOL 



aroma that came from him. But his 
concern was all for the screen. 

“Professor,” he said, “they are 
learning. Suddenly they are doing a 
number of new things. After these 
many months they are showing an 
intelligence I never suspected they 
had.” 

“Not all, I suspect.” 

“No, no, of course not. It’s the 
big one. A mutant, probably. He’s 
questioning. He’s challenging every 
taboo pattern, every custom. And 
he’s getting away with it simply be- 
cause he’s bigger. He’s brow- 
beating them.” 

She turned her golden eyes on 
him. Her long rows of white teeth 
gleamed, and her tail-tip vibrated 
rapidly. These were sympathetic 
gestures, the equivalent of an indul- 
gent smile. 

“No one solves problems without 
enthusiasm, Vibran, but I’m sure 
you know you’re jumping to con- 
clusions. It certainly isn’t that sim- 
ple. Whenever something changes, 
it is easy to cry mutation. You 
know it doesn’t have to be that at 
all.” 

He bowed his great crested head, 
quivered his own tail-tip. 

“Of course, Professor. I 
hypothesize too quickly. But you’ll 
admit I withdraw most of them lat- 
er. For me, they’re a way of think- 
ing.” 

“No fault. Take an exercise. 
Why else could the large one be 
large?’ ’ 

His tail vibrated more rapidly 

149 



than ever, and his white tusks 
showed magnificently. He was 
amused as he thought of the big 
one. 

“Perhaps because he has been 
stealing food and water practically 
from the time he was hatched. He 
was hungry, and the taboo didn’t 
stop him.” 

“They do not produce eggs. Be 
accurate.” 

“I’m sorry. Professor. Just a fig- 
ure of speech. Anyway, he did eat 
at night, and grew. This stimulates 
a thought. Thank you, Professor. It 
could be that this is inherently a 
much bigger life form, dwarfed by 
many generations of barely subsis- 
tence diet.” 

“History confirms this. You have 
consulted the records. You recall 
why this race has been given special 
protection, special endangered 
species consideration, when many 
others have been allowed to become 
extinct.” 

The student lowered his great 
head. The brilliant blue of his throat 
column grew pale, and his tail-tip 
was limp. He was embarrassed. 

“Professor, I apologize. I have 
been so fascinated by the dynamics 
of this problem, by observing the 
stylized mechanics of this colony, 
that I haven’t researched the history 
of the species as I should have. I 
reasoned that I could do this later, 
when my data-gathering in the field 
was complete.” 

“Wrong sequence, and you know 
it,” the Professor said severely. 

150 



“Proper background preparation 
might well change the entire pattern 
of your observations. You usually 
do this so well. That is why I as- 
signed this colony to you. It is one 
of three surviving on the planet, and 
they are all different. Each has its 
own protected habitat, where it is 
given minimal food and allowed to 
live as it will. None may be physi- 
cally approached. All may be studied 
by remote methods. I have thought 
that our desert colony, in addition 
to being handy for observation, may 
well be the most rewarding of the 
three. I expect you to learn what- 
ever it can teach us.” 

“Professor, I am ashamed. I will 
survey the records at once.” 

The Professor relented. She was 
secretly proud of the magnificent 
big student’s confusion. She knew 
that he had a superior mind, and 
that he would complete a study 
more worthy than any other student 
she had ever had. 

“Conference,” she said abruptly. 
“Some guide lines.” 

“Recording.” His response was 
automatic. He activated a small 
round recorder that hung on his 
broad chest. 

“We maintain the remnants of 
this race in endangered species 
status because we owe our existence 
to them. Perhaps we are grateful to 
them. But, more pragmatically, we 
keep them before us as an ever- 
present reminder of the dangers in- 
herent in too much knowledge.” 
“Dangers, Professor? Isn’t that 

GALAXY 



something of a paradox? The ac- 
quiring of knowledge is your life 
concern — and mine. I don’t under- 
stand.” 

“Knowledge, of itself, is sterile. 
To have value, it must be utilized. 
It can be used with wisdom, or it 
can be used destructively. So 
knowledge without wisdom is 
dangerous.” 

“Logical. Certainly we are striv- 
ing for wisdom as well as to know. 
But philosophy is based in fact. 
Without fact it would not be easy to 
be wise.” 

The Professor’s white teeth 
flashed and her tail-tip quivered. 

“Of course. Both are necessary. 
We strive for balance. And in this 
the species you are studying 
failed.” 

“I do not follow you. I should 
have reviewed the records.” 

“You will, in detail. Meanwhile, 
know this. Those little furtive crea- 
tures, living in burrows out of the 
desert heat, dependent for water on 
the pool fed by the pipeline we in- 
stalled hundreds of years ago, their 
only food the carefully balanced 
diet in solution continually forced 
up through the porous rock, to crys- 
tallize when the water evaporates; 
those little creatures once dominated 
this planet.” 

The student’s dark basilisk eyes 
glittered. His quivering tail-tip ex- 
pressed both interest and amuse- 
ment. 

‘‘An hypothesis, of course. 
Based, perhaps, on paleontological 

152 



evidence of earlier wide-spread oc- 
currence?” 

“I did not mention hypothesis. 
This is something well-known, 
deeply studied, overwhelmingly ver- 
ified. Like most students of the sci- 
ences, you are still narrowly edu- 
cated. Make a note to audit a series 
of lectures on planet history. To 
deal with your problem species you 
require much more perspective.” 
“Noted. Professor, this is becom- 
ing a most helpful conference. I 
thank you. Will you discuss one 
more point?” 

“Designate.” 

“How, possibly, could we owe 
our own existence to my little desert 
creatures? Is this a philosophical al- 
lusion?” 

“No. Quite literal. You know 
that, some millions of years past — 
the exact time is not certain — the 
planet developed areas of great 
radioactivity. It was long before the 
cause was finally understood.” 
“Artificially produced, were they 
not? I am not entirely ignorant. Pro- 
fessor, though I may at times give 
that impression.” 

“I have hope for you,” the Pro- 
fessor said drily, but with a pride 
her voice concealed rather poorly. 
“Artificially produced, as you say. 
Produced by a species that had 
reached a technological level we 
admire and despair of even today. 
Much of our knowledge has come 
from study of their artifacts.” 

“Of course.” The big student 
nodded his crested head. “Men. I 



GALAXY 



should have made the connection. 
But the relationship of all this to 
our own existence is still not clear 
to me.” 

‘‘Quite simple. The radioactivity 
came in all instances from con- 
trolled atomic disintegration; incred- 
ible, unbelievable atomic blasts as 
warring factions of men destroyed 
each other, and very nearly decimated 
all other life on the planet. All crea- 
tures, all chlorophyll bearers that 
remained bore the scars of the unna- 
tural strife. The effects of radiation 
on germ plasm are well understood. 
So imagine this entire world glow- 
ing with radioactivity! Imagine how 
life then changed over the mil- 
lenia.” 

‘‘I have an inkling. Of course our 
own race, like most stable species, 
developed as a result of the atomic 
wars. We are aware, in general, of 
the evolutionary trail we must have 
followed. Are you saying that it is 
now specifically known what we 
were before?” 

“It is finally known. A brilliant 
summary has recently been recorded 
by a team of geneticists, paleon- 
tologists and Earth historians. I will 
give you the reference. Generally I 
do not find these cooperative ven- 
tures very competent, but this one is 
superior. 

“I will review it immediately. 
Would you,” he hesitated, “would 
you state their conciusions? Sud- 
denly I have a tremendous need to 
know my own ancestors!” 

The Professor flashed her rosy 



throat and gave an intimate signifi- 
cance to the quivering of her tail- 
tip. She knew, clearly and honestly, 
that her present concern, growing 
stronger all the while, was more 
with her immediate descendents. 

“It seems that we are derived 
from a tiny species that made its 
home in the waste places of the 
planet; in the deserts.” She gestured 
at the screen. “There is your an- 
cestral home — and mine. We scur- 
ried about over the sands, fed on 
desert insects, drank the dew from 
rock faces and desert plants, and 
dug burrows under boulders to es- 
cape the blazing heat. We were 
simply small desert lizards, and we 
had no thoughts at all.” 

“And then, in the hard radiation, 
we mutated, again and again!” He 
took up the story. “I can cry muta- 
tion here, Professor, because it is 
fact. Has to be.” 

She nodded, and the student went 
on eagerly: 

“Continuing genetic change, 
from small to great. Evolution, but 
greatly accelerated. Many strange 
forms resulted, most without ability 
to survive for long. But finally 
came awareness, conscious thought, 
cause and effect learning. We chose 
the best habitats. We developed so- 
ciety, cooperative effort. We 
explored natural forces. We discov- 
ered the past, and learned from it.” 

“And that, at least, we are con- 
tinuing to do,” the Professor said. 
“We have not yet matched all of 
man’s technology, but we are more 

153 



THE ROCK AND THE POOL 



civilized than he ever became, be- 
cause we respect the dangers inher- 
ent in knowledge misused.” 

He moved around the desk, 
touched the adjustment control of 
the screen. “May I, Professor?” 

“You are welcome.” 

The picture zoomed. A tiny 
bright speck in the desert landscape 
became the Pool, sparkling in the 
morning sun. Beyond it, the dark 
pillar of the Rock lifted like a finger 
from the sand. Everywhere the scat- 
tered boulders lay, and under them 
the mouths of burrows, with an 
apron of sand spread neatly into a 
hard-packed, level space before 
each opening. 

The colony was busy; or busy 
after its fashion. A few of the be- 
ings still dipped water from the 
Pool, then went quickly to the 
boulder shadows where most al- 
ready sat, sipping carefully from the 
small bowls, and speaking quietly 
to neighbors. 

“And that, Vibran, is man. Lord 
of this planet. Reaching out toward 
the stars, he could not control his 
own knowledge, and it destroyed 
him. Now he is grateful for a patch 
of shade and a bowlful of cool wa- 
ter. He substitutes custom for think- 
ing. He takes his food from the 
Rock without understanding or 
questioning how it comes to be 
there.” 

The big student shook his crested 
head. 

“Professor, you are a wise and a 
profound thinker, and we must re- 

154 



spect your mind. But I, too, have a 
mind, and I believe you are drawing 
your final line too soon.” 

“Tell me.” 

“I have watched these beings 
since the Large One there first came 
out of the burrow and began to 
scurry about. He has curiosity. He 
has initiative. And if he has these 
things it means that aggressiveness 
and capacity for thought still reside 
in the germ plasm of this race. 
From his behavior I believe he is 
questioning. And everything he 
does is an irritant to the unthinking 
complacency of others. When they 
react to him, and they are already, 
they too are beginning to think.” 

“It is a scanty remnant, Vibran. 
The gene pool is small.” 

“Granted . But you have said that 
two other colonies are being main- 
tained.” 

“But far removed. They are not 
likely to meet. One occupies a rock 
slide high on the side of a moun- 
tain. The other inhabits a small bit 
of jungle.” 

“It was not likely that small des- 
ert lizards would see the other side 
of this planet, or know the universe 
for what it is. But we have. 

The Professor rose from her 
couch with a smooth, sinuous 
grace. Nine feet tall she stood, her 
green body scales, rosy throat and 
blue crest all contributing to a spec- 
tacular figure. She turned her gold- 
en eyes on him, her favorite stu- 
dent, who loomed taller still. 

“You have imagination, Vibran. 

GALAXY 



It is of course possible that man 
could, in time, again take charge of 
his own destiny. It is remote, but it 
could happen. Then how much 
more likely is it that we, with our 
clearer vision, greater learning, and 
careful reproductive selection, 
should continue to be the dominant, 
the guiding race, on this planet? 
Man had his chance. We are doing 
a better job.” 

“And will continue, as long as 
each meets his or her respon- 
sibilities. I accept that, of course. 
Professor, you have the best mind 
of us all. Have you contributed to 
the gene pool? What you do for our 
race should not be confined to 
thought.” 

“As you well know, I have pro- 
duced no eggs. Until now, there 
had been no one competent to fer- 
tilize them.” 

The student’s dark eyes glittered. 

“There have been applicants in 
plenty, I am sure.” 

“There have been,” she ac- 
knowledged. “But none that 
seemed right to me. For me, there 
must be something more than a 
worthy gene chart.” 

The deep blue of the big male’s 
pulsing throat had never been bright- 
er. His tail-tip vibrated suddenly 
with intense feeling. 

“Professor, I have a good chart, 
and I can think. But more, I have 
my greatest pleasure in your com- 
pany. May I fertilize your eggs?” 

The golden eyes looked at him 
calmly. She reached out and

touched him lightly with one grace- 
ful, clawed hand, but she could not 
prevent the excited quivering of her 
own tail-tip. 

“I have thought of it, Vibran. 
But there would have to be more. I 
would want a Permanent Compan- 
ionship, not a Limited Friendship. 
Does your thinking include a com- 
mitment so large?” 

“I would have nothing less,” he 
said promptly. “The entire planet 
will envy me.” 

She now saw no reason to con- 
ceal her admiration. Her beautiful 
eyes swept him from flared crest to 
quivering tail-tip. 

“When the planet sees you as I 
do now, it will envy me as well.” 
He took a stride and stood beside 
her. With sudden shyness she 
turned toward the screen. 

“Your Large One is doing some- 
thing purposeful in the shadow of 
the Rock. What is it?” 

“Each day he does that. He is 
bringing stones, as large as he can 
lift, and making a pile by the Rock. 
By standing on the pile he reaches 
food higher than any of them ever 
have before. It is another example 
of his thinking. I’m sure he never 
stops.” 

“You are drawing conclusions on 
too little data again, Vibran. Give 
me other evidence.” 

He adjusted the screen. 

“See the green plant rising above 
the boulder? It is a date palm, and 
he is responsible for it. As you 
know, this stretch of desert almost 

156 



never has rain. The hardiest cacti 
won’t grow here. But there are 
quick-growing desert annuals, tiny 
little plants which germinate, grow, 
flower and seed in a few days, that 
have persisted in the sand all these 
many years. 

“One brief shower will provide 
enough moisture for their life cy- 
cles. You may not have known, but 
some fifty days ago there was a 
shower here. The whole region was 
colorful when the little plants 
bloomed. And somehow, from 
somewhere, there was a dormant 
date seed that germinated. 

“It should have died. But I found 
that he was watering it! Each night 
he gave it a bowlful. Now it’s so 
large it gets four bowls. And he no 
longer steals it from the Pool at 
night. He takes it openly, in the 
cool morning, and no one dares 
stop him. He has learned that the 
Pool will stay full, no matter how 
much water is used.” 

She nodded her head with ap- 
preciation. 

“Is there more?” 

“Another thing. It may be the 
most important of all. Over in the 
shadow of that red boulder there is 
a very old Man. Each day the Large 
One brings him food, and water 
from the Pool. Always before, 
when they could no longer get their 
own nourishment, they died.” 

“Responsibility,” the Professor 
said slowly. “Responsibility for a 
fellow being. Yes, that could be 
very important indeed.” 



GALAXY 




★ ★ ★ 

The Old One lay comfortably in 
the shadow of his boulder. He had 
had his food. A bowl of cool water 
rested on his ancient knees, and 
from time to time he took a reviv- 
ing sip. His pale eyes, dimmer each 
day, watched as the Large One 
toiled at the now massive pyramid 
of stones beside the Rock. Each day 
he had built it higher. Each day he 
had gathered food scales from a 
new space on the Rock, a space no 
other being had ever reached. 

Always, when the Large One 
climbed to the top of his pile of 
stones, he stood for a minute, rest- 
ing, and looking out across the 
sand. 

The One One knew that the 



young eyes were seeing the dark 
shadowy masses where the sand 
ended, the beginning of another 
world. 

The Old One dreamed. He had 
often dreamed of that other world, 
where there might be coolness and 
much water and many green things. 
And he knew that the Large One, 
from his lofty perch, could see 
more clearly than he ever had. 

“He has greater vision than I 
have had. He sees farther. His will 
be a better world.” 

The Old One murmured gently to 
himself. A contented smile grew on 
the gray, wrinkled face. The skinny 
old fingers loosened their grip on 
the water bowl. The dim eyes 
closed. And peacefully the Old One 
died. ★

technology construct orbiting cities in Earth’s Lagrangian Points; our own 
Dr. J.E. Pournelle reported in the September ’75 issue of Galaxy how we 
can, with present technology, proceed to terraform Venus; and Dr. Howard 
L. Forward, Senior Scientist of Hughes Laboratories will be featured in the 
next issue of Galaxy in an article in which he claims it is time to begin 
construction of unmanned probes to the nearer stars. 

Hmm. .perhaps the best word with which to replace ‘earth’ would be 
‘universe.’ “Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the universe. .” 
Could that be what God was getting at? Frankly it seems more in scale, as 
it were, with the Lord of Creation, than his telling us that we must breed 
and breed and breed on this one lonely little planet until we have converted 
its entire mass to human flesh! 

There is a point to all this, by the way: anyone who both believes in the 
Old Testament and accepts the validity of the foregoing argument must 
consider himself as divinely instructed to do all in his power to further the 
progress of humankind into Space. That means he must do all in his power 
to further the development of our space capabilities, and that he must resist 
and defy any person, process or philosophy that acts to the detriment of 
that goal. For example: conservationism when carried to the extreme of 
halting technological (not industrial) development; or, at the other end of 
the spectrum, land-rape or other misuse of resources in such fashion as to 
detract from the ability of the environment to support an energy-intensive 
civilization; and then, of course, there’s birth control. 

The single greatest threat to a technology capable of “replenishing the 
universe” is over-population; if we double this planet’s population just one 
more time we may not be able to afford the technological/economic effort 
required to get into Space. Therefore, just as when a man of the Middle 
Ages took the Cross he was given absolution for all sins, mortal or venal, 
that he had ever committed or would commit while on crusade, or as in 
World War II when an American soldier of the Roman Catholic Faith was 
allowed meat on Friday, so too should all persons fully committed to the 
goal of getting the human race into Space be given dispensation to practice 
family planning. Of course for those who do not make their home on 
Planet Earth, the injunction will hold full force: be fruitful and multiply! 

So. It would seem that man has received his Marching Orders, indeed 
has been in receipt of them for several thousand years — but is only now 
capable of truly understanding and implementing them. Or, in the idiom of 
that earlier Crusade, Te Veulnt — God wills it!
