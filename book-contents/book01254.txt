REPORT 

iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiuiuiiniiiiiiiiiiiiiiuiiiu 

Not so many weeks ago “the great- 
est show on earth” folded its tents 
for the last time. Just a short time 
before this dramatic announcement, 
other major circuses went into 
bankruptcy or were forced to shut 
down. It was an era dying, an era 
of fanfare and color and superla- 
tives and fun for all ages passing 
into history. No more thrilling 
clamor of the midway, smell and 
roar of the animals, barking of 
pitchmen, swelling tones of the 
calliope, and the excited shrieks 
and laughter of children. Some re- 
ports say the major circuses will 
play hereafter in big air-condi- 
tioned arenas. Some say they will 
fold forever. But even if they do 
continue in the big arenas, they’ll 
never be the same again. Not to 
me, anyway. I’ve seen the circus at 
Madison Square Garden and I’ve 
seen it under the big top pitched in 
country meadows. But the city 
arena of concrete and steel was 
never as exciting and suspenseful 
and filled with the spirit of holiday 
as the canvas and ropes. 



Every now and then an author will 
ask what is our approach to science 
fiction and the answer is the same 
as it has always been : A philosoph- 
ical approach with good writing 
getting the call over gadgetry and 
scientific gimmicks. And I am al- 
ways glad to receive a letter from 
an author reporting that at local 
gatherings of authors and artists 
the majority feel the same way. 
Fox B. Holden (his real name), 
who wrote Dearest Enemy (Oct. 
IF), and A Matter of Order (Aug. 
IF), recently said: “I began writ- 
ing science fiction while still in col- 
lege because I felt that science goes 
— or can go — a long way beyond 
the production of gadgets. Taken 
far enough it really, to my mind, 
becomes one with philosophy. And 
philosophy, after all, is just think- 
ing — the kind of thinking that is 
impossible for animals, but of 
which Man is allegedly capable. 

“It’s the kind of thinking that 
can give us all a glimpse of the 
might-be — which usually is a 
brighter subject than the might- 
have-been. Hope, they call it — and 
it does something to keep a guy’s 
chin up — even if it is sometimes 
worked through a negative “bet- 
ter not do that ” approach. And 
how could you evaluate positive- 
ness, anyway, if you didn’t have a 
few minus signs here and there to 
go by? 

“So — science-philosophy. And 

when it’s put down by people who 
like to spin yarns, it becomes sci- 
ence fiction.” 

Fox Holden, incidentally, lives in 
nearby Poughkeepsie and is a part- 
time science fictioneer whose full- 



2 




time job is that of publicity writer 
for the electronic research division 
of one of the world’s large manu- 
facturers of typewriters and com- 
puting machines. He is a graduate 
of Middlebury College in Vermont, 
getting his sheepskin after putting 
in four years in the Infantry, Air 
Force and Armored Forces. Before 
going to his present job, he served 
seven years as a newspaper man. In 
his present work he is as close to a 
push-button world of gadgets and 
technology as a writer could pos- 
sibly be — yet his science fiction 
writing reveals ideals far, far afield. 

Two new anthologies are due for 

early publication — a collection of 
Richard Matheson’s short stories 
and a variety of authors compiled 
by Ted Dikty. Included in the 
Matheson selections is Being one of 
the most suspenseful, eerie and 
chilling tales to ever appear in IF. 
Frank Reilly’s The Cyber and Jus- 
tice Holmes is included in the 
Dikty selection . Hero Driver by 
Alfred Coppel, who seems to have 
drifted from science fiction circles, 
will soon be released as a movie by 
United Artists . Bourgey and 
Curl, late comers to science fiction 
book publishing, will bring out For 
These , My Children by Raymond 
F. Jones. Ray Jones has appeared 
in these pages on a number of oc- 
casions, always with some top-notch 
entertainment ... A writers’ maga- 
zine recently reported Harlan El- 
lison’s age as “just sixteen”. If 
true, he sure got married mighty 
young and learned an awful lot at a 
tender age to have written The 
Crackpots (June IF). Gordon 



Dickson has something of a lulu in 
Lulungomeena which is scheduled 
for X-Minus-One, the N.B.C. sci- 
ence fiction TV show . Head of 
what is perhaps America’s largest 
stable of science fiction writers, 
among others, is a stocky, well-set, 
dark haired dynamo of an agent 
you sf readers seldom, if ever, hear 
about. His name is Scott Meredith 
and his staff of readers, located on 
the 18th floor of a Fifth Avenue 
office building, outnumbers the per- 
sonnel of many good-sized publish- 
ing houses ... It becomes more evi- 
dent each day that the most con- 
stant thing about science fiction is 
the interest of the American fans. 
May their tribe increase. Prime ex- 
ample: About the time you read 
this, The Los Angeles Science Fan- 
tasy Society will hold its 1000th 
meeting. That , brother, is being 
constant! . Two offers for Dr. 
Alan E. Nourse to practice in a 
“quiet town where there is time to 
write science fiction” — one from 
California and one from Alaska 
(see August IF). By the way, Dr. 
Nourse is working on an outline for 
an article on the future of medical 
progress that promises to be one of 
the most fascinating you ever read. 
It will be in an early issue.

World of IF, Wrap around cover 
and end papers are by Mel Hunter. 
Preliminary color sketch for the 
cover is a honey. We’ll list proposed 
stories and authors in the next IF.

small printing for newsstand dis-

IT'S COLD 



Outside was miserably primitive , while 
the City-State was Utopia. What reason 

could a person have for swapping heaven 

for hell unless it was for laughs! 



4 





OUTSIDE 



BY RICHARD WILSON 



T HEY’D FOUND a way to make it stop rain- 
ing in the city and he didn’t like that. Oren had 
one of the few outdoor gardens remaining in 
Greater New York and he’d had to hook up an 
irrigation system fed by hose from a tap in his base- 
ment. While he was at it, he ran another hose up to 
sprinklers above the windows of his ground-floor 
study and arranged them so they could send a 
shower of water against the panes from outside. 



5 




He turned the rain on hard so 
that water drummed against the 
glass with the realistic sound of a 
downpour. It was almost satisfying. 
The bright sunlight streaming 
through the drops spoiled it, some- 
what. 

Oren had known people who’d 
missed more than the rain. Some 
had bid good-by to the city proper 
and moved to the suburbs, though 
they remained within the bound- 
aries of the City-State. Others 
had fled Outside. 

But there were those who had 
wanted, or needed, the benefits of 
the super-metropolis — and they 

compromised, as Oren and his wife 
had. 

They’d diverted the rain away 
from the cities because it was mostly 
a waste to have it fall there. It was 
better to shunt it over to where it 
could fill a reservoir or unparch a 
desert or put out a forest fire — pro- 
vided these places were on re- 
sources land belonging to one of 
the City-States. All very laudable, 
Oren supposed, but it was an inter- 
ference with nature that he didn’t 
care for. He was a conservative, 
an anti-progress crank. 

Actually, euphemisms aside, he 
knew he was an anti-regimentarian. 
Had he been one outside his pri- 
vate thoughts, though, he would 
have been considered an undesir- 
able member of society. It wasn’t 
illegal, yet, to question the Sugges- 
tions of the City-State Council. 
Thus far, the Suggestions lacked 
the force of law. They served, how- 
ever, to establish customs which 
most citizens found it wise to follow 
if they cared to avoid harassment 

6 



by the green-tunicked members of 
the Council Guard. 

It was no more illegal to be an 
anti-regimentarian in Greater New 
York in 2009 than it had been to 
be a Jew in the early days of Hitler- 
Germany, a Communist in the 
latter days of the United States, or 
a Conciliationist during the States’ 
Rights Wars — in which the vic- 
tors became the City-States and the 
losers were banished Outside. 

But obviously it was healthier 
to keep quiet and follow Council- 
decreed custom than to seek 
justice in the letter of the law. 

Oren was just sitting there in 
the study, smoking, not really 
thinking consciously about any of 
this, when his wife came in. His 
body was cradled to the optimum 
relaxation point in the restochair, 
but he was nervous. 

“Oh, you’ve got the rain on,” 
Edith said. “That’s nice. But the 
sun kind of spoils it.” 

“Yes, it does,” Oren said. “Pull 
the blinds, will you, honey?” 

She darkened the room and 
curled up into a resto next to his. 
“That is better,” she said. “Makes 
it more cozy.” 

He lighted a cigaret for her and 
for a time they sat quietly while 
smoke rose to mingle with the 
shadows of the room. 

“It is today, isn’t it, Oren?” she 
said finally. “I haven’t been able 
to concentrate on a thing. I’ve got 
that orchestration sitting on the 
piano — the one the maestro wants 
by tomorrow — but I don’t have the 
patience to finish it.” 

“It’s just routine, isn’t it? Noth- 
ing you couldn’t knock out in a 

RICHARD WILSON 




couple of hours, I should think.” 

“Yes, but I seem to be so jumpy,” 
his wife said. “I know I’m not sup- 
posed to be. It isn’t Modem, and 
all that, but I am.” 

He laughed and reached out a 
hand to pat her flat waistline. 

“Old skinny-tummy,” he said. 
“It used to be that only the hus- 
bands went through waiting and 
smoking themselves into a frazzle. 
Now the female of the species 
knows what it’s like, too. Relax,” 
he said. He tried to give it the 
casual touch. “Our baby will be 
bom at the proper moment, sani- 
tary, strong and just as squally as 
the old-fashioned ones. The obby 
said he’d call immediately from 
the delivery lab and we’ll probably 
see him tomorrow, when the little 
bugger’s adjusted to things.” 

“The obby!” Edith said. “What 
a terrible expression. Dr. Morales is 
the best obstetrician in Greater 
New York and you call him an 
obby, as if he were some kind of 
gadget.” 

“Well, isn’t he? I think I’m be- 
ing very modern and enlightened 
about this whole impersonal busi- 
ness. Our first child is being bom 
six miles away in an antiseptic lab- 
oratory while its mother and 
father sit smoking and discussing 
terminology. Nine months ago they 
got a droplet of goo from me and 
one from you and mixed them up 
in a high-gear cocktail shaker and 
ever since it’s been growing in a 
bowl of heat-controlled expando- 
mush on a shelf where they look at 
it every so frequently and see that 
it’s not^going sour and agitate it a 
bit so it won’t think its forgotten. 

ITS COLD OUTSIDE 



If that doesn’t entitle me to call Dr. 
Morales an obby I don’t know 
what does.” 

“Really, Oren, you’re terrible,” 
she said. “You talk as if somebody 
put something over on you. After 
all, you’re the one who wanted to do 
it this way. I was perfectly willing 
to go about it in the old-fashioned 
way. There’s no law against it — 
not really. Just a Suggestion. And 
we could have moved Outside, if 
necessary. We’d have gotten along 
all right.” 

“We’ve been over this so many 
times, Edith,” he said. He was be- 
ing angry in his icy-calm way. “Let 
me enumerate the points for you. 
One — we’re both Intellectuals, so 
called. You’re a musician; I pub- 
lish talking books. It just so hap- 
pens that the seats of our culture — 
the only places we could make a 
living — are the city-states. We’re 
not farmers or workers and we’d 
be of no use on the Outside. 

“Point two — if we left Greater 
New York where would we go? 
Ghicagoland? The Bay? Dixieton? 
One’s as bad as the other — and 
besides none of them has a decent 
publishing house, even if you could 
write your music wherever you had 
a piano. 

“Point three — although it would 
be socially unacceptable to have a 
natural baby here, it would be safe. 
You’d have the best facilities, even 
if you got lectured at while you 
used them. Who knows what would 
happen to you Outside?” 

“I’m sure people survive natural 
pregnancy on the Outside just as 
they used to,” Edith said. “I think 
you’ve listened to the Council so 



7 




long that you’re beginning to be- 
lieve everything you’re told. Next 
they’ll be telling you what kind of 
books to publish, if they haven’t al- 
ready.” 

She had become angry herself, 
now, as she did when he assumed 
his superior-logic tone of voice. In- 
stantly he was contrite. He realized 
that he had been sharp with her 
only because she had verbalized the 
dilemma he wanted to avoid hav- 
ing to recognize. 

“I’m sorry, Edie,” he said. “I’m 
all tense. This waiting around for 
someone else to have our baby for 
us has me on edge. And you’re 
right about the Council. They sent 
us a Suggestion last week. Very 
logical thing it was, too, on the sur- 
face. They’d noted that some of 
the titles on our back list haven’t 
been moving well' lately. That’s 
true enough. They rarely do. 
They’re standards, though, and 
the sales are steady, if small. But 
the Council Suggested that we let 
them go out of print. In the in- 
terests of conservation, of course. 
It was just a Suggestion, mind 
you; we can take it or leave it.” 

“And if you leave it?” 

“I don’t know. I think it’s just 
a feeler the Council is putting out, 
to see how far it can go. I suppose 
if enough publishers took it, in- 
stead of leaving it, the next step 
would be a Resolution, to bring 
the rest of us into line.” 

“What kind of titles are they 
Suggesting you drop?” Edie asked. 
“Simply to help save tape, of 
course.” 

“Oh, some works on politics and 
government, as you might expect, 

6 



and some less likely — such as a 
whole list of titles by Haskell, the 
naturalist.” 

“You’re resisting the Suggestion, 
I hope.” 

“I don’t know,” he said. “We’re 
having a conference on it tomor- 
row. We did take one of their Sug- 
gestions, but that was strictly merit- 
wise.” 

“° h? ” 

“It wasn’t exactly a Suggestion. 
It was a letter of recommendation 
sent along with a manuscript by a 
Dr. Stern, the head of the Health 
Department. We’re taping his book. 
It’s about his pet theory, but it’s 
sound. You know, the one about 
the creativity of women. I told you 
about it.” 

“I don’t remember,” she said. 
“But I don’t think I’ll' like it.” 

“It applies to you, though. Stern’s 
theory is that for so many hundreds 
of centuries women had been con- 
ditioned to motherhood that as a 
group they had a block against 
other channels of creativity. Even 
the unmarried and childless 
couldn’t break the pattern because 
they themselves were the products 
of motherhood. Theoretically, that 
would be why you’re having such 
difficulty with your music.” 

“But my mother was decon- 
ditioned,” she protested. “She was 
born naturally, but I grew up in 
a bowl of mush, as you call it, and 
I intend to break the pattern.” 
“It’s a three-generation process, 
Stern thinks,” Oren said. “Not that 
I agree with him necessarily, but if 
we had a daughter, and if she were 
an obbv baby, she might be the first 
to break the pattern in our family — 

RICHARD WILSON 




if she had any talent, of course.” 
“You and your Dr. Stern can 
have his theory. I intend to break 
the pattern myself,” Edith said. 
“Provided I don’t fall back into it 
by having a baby myself in the 
normal way. I’ll write that sym- 
phony yet, you’ll see.” 

“Now you’re being inconsistent.” 
She smiled as she recognized the 
truth of his remark. 

“All right,” she said. “But that’s 
my prerogative. They haven’t bred 
that out of us yet. I’m still a wom- 
an.” She became serious again. 
“And I guess that’s why I don’t 
know whether I want to have an- 
other baby this way. It’s so imper- 
sonal, so cold — like going shopping. 
This way is so easy; it saves so 
much time and makes everything 
so simple. But do you appreciate 
the things you get the easy way, or 
do things only become precious to 
you when you’d had to suffer to 
have them?” 

“Now don’t give me any of that 
martyr talk,” Oren said. “Were you 
any less precious to your mother 
because you were an obby baby?” 
He grinned. “As I recall, you were 
about the most spoiled creature in 
existence until I snatched you from 
the bosom of your family.” 

His joke failed to return the smile 
to her face. 

“I’m worried about something 
else,” she said. “Aside from the 
psychological aspects of the thing. 
I mean, have I deteriorated ... as 
a woman? I don’t want to be just a 
brain and a talent, if I am that. I 
want to be interesting in that other 
way, loo — the way grandma was 
when she was a girl.” 

ITS COLD OUTSIDE 



He turned in his chair to look 
directly at her. “Believe me, Edie, 
you’re interesting. Oh, yes. Believe 
me.” 

Then he leaned over and kissed 
her soundly on the mouth. 

“If you wish,” he said, “I’ll elab- 
orate on that comment.” 

“Do that,” she said. 

But the elaboration had to wait. 
There was a musical tone and a 
voice said: 

“Dr. Morales calling Mr. and 
Mrs. Oren Donn.” 

“There he is,” said Edith. 
“There he is!” 

“Now calm down,” her husband 
said. “Are you ready? Would you 
like a drink or anything before we 
talk to him?” 

“No. Go ahead, answer him.” 

Oren spoke the words that 
opened the communications cir- 
cuits of their home to the doctor’s 
call. 

“Donn Fourteen. Hello, Doctor, 
this is Oren Donn. Edith’s here, 
too.” 

“Hello,” said Dr. Morales. “Your 
son has been born.” 

“A son!” Oren cried. “Do you 
hear that, Edie? It’s a boy!” 

“That’s wonderful,” she said. 
“How does he look, Doctor?” 

“Perfect,” Dr. Morales said. 
“He’s a lively little tike. Got good 
color, too. Not all red like these 
natural children. He’s had his first 
cry and his first meal and now he’s 
sleeping. You can see him tomor- 
row at — say fourteen hundred. 
Will that be convenient for you?” 

“That’ll be fine,” Oren said. 
Edith nodded agreement. “I’d like 

9 




to bring him a little present, if I 
may. A little gold wristband my 
father gave me when I was born. 
Sort of a family tradition, you 
know.” 

“I’m afraid that won’t be pos- 
sible, Mr. Donn,” the doctor said. 
“You know the rules. No foreign 
matter must touch him except 
what the laboratory provides. 
That’s why you were advised not 
to buy any clothing or bedding in 
advance. We have all the things 
the child needs right here. In six 
weeks, when you take him home, 
you can dress him in an Indian 
suit, if you wish, but until then 
you must abide by our rules.” 

“Of course, Doctor,” Edith said. 
“We understand. Tomorrow at 
fourteen hundred, then.” 

“Right. Goodby.” 

“Goodby.” 

The double goodby switched off 
the communicator and a single 
musical tone signalled that the con- 
nection was closed. 

“Well,” said Oren, “there he is. 
Bom and everything. How do you 
feel?” 

“A little weak. Honestly,” she 
said. “I feel as if something had 
happened to me physically, just 
now. A lightening of pressure, 
sort of, and yet a kind of frustra- 
tion. I can’t explain it, really.” 
“It’s strange,” Oren said. “I 
don’t know how a natural father 
used to feel, after he’d been sweat- 
ing it out in a hospital corridor, 
but I’m pretty excited. But what 
bothers me is that I had the same 
sort of feeling when the dealer 
called up last year to say that 
our new gyro was ready to be de- 

10 



livered.” 

“Funny,” she said. “He won’t 
really be ours for six weeks. And 
until then I won’t even be able to 
hold him in my arms except half an 
hour a day. What is that horrible 
name they have for it?” 

“Parent Acclimatization.” 

He took her hand and squeezed 
it. Then he got to his feet deci- 
sively. 

“I’ll get you a drink. A good stiff 
one. Then I want you to go in and 
finish that orchestration. We’ve got 
to snap out of this.” 

“All right,” she said. 

“And while you’re working, I’ll 
go out. I feel like taking a walk in 
the rain.” 

“But there isn’t any rain,” she 
said, “except just outside the win- 
dow.” She turned a switch and 
stopped the drumming of the Water 
on the panes. “You are in a State, 
aren’t you?” 

“He laughed. “I certainly am. 
All right, then, I’ll fix us both a 
drink.” 

Later, when Edith had finished 
the orchestration, Oren asked: 

“Shall we see what’s on the 
triveo?” 

“I don’t care,” she said. “If you 

Hke.” 

When television first went three- 
dimensional it was called tri-video, 
to distinguish it. In time this was 
shortened to triveo, first with a 
long i y then with a short one. And 
there were many, like Edith, who 
changed the word once more — to 
trivia. 

There was always a discussion 
about the triveo before they 

RICHARD WILSON 




switched it on. Sometimes weeks 
went by during which it lay silent 
and unseen. Probably it was the 
least-used piece of equipment in 
the house, a price it paid for its 
lack of intelligent programming. 

Oren pushed a button on the 
panel attached to the arm of his 
restochair and a section of the 
living room wall became the front 
page of the daily gazette. He dialed 
for the triveo section. 

“It says Jerry Hilarious is on,” he 
said. 

Edith squinted at the projected 
page. There was a flat shot of a 
man in evening clothes, with his 
eyes crossed and his tongue held 
grotesquely in a corner of his 
mouth. 

“Looks more like a Jerry Grue- 
some,” she said. “Who is he?” 

“A comic, it says. It’s his triveo 
premiere. He’s made a big hit in 
the pleasurants, it also says.” 

“I’m glad we eat at home, then,” 
she said, “where we don’t have to 
have belly laughs with our roast 
beef.” 

“Let’s try him,” Oren said. “We 
can always turn him off.” 

“All right,” she said. “But you 
never do. You hang on to the grim 
end of everything.” 

“You’ve got to give them a 
chance. We wouldn’t have any tal- 
ent at all if everybody was con- 
demned sight unseen.” 

“Off with their heads!” said 
Edith cheerfully; and later, when 
Jerry Hilarious had made his de- 
but, she asked: “You call this tal- 
ent?* 

The comedian was a short, 
skinny man who gave the appear- 

ITS COLD OUTSIDE 



ance of brash boyishness, though 
he must have been well into his 
thirties. He had a crop of scarlet 
hair whose vividness resulted either 
from dye or the affinity of the 
triveo cameras for the primary 
colors. 

Jerry Hilarious also had an 
amazingly plastic face which he 
contorted at will and a repertory of 
startling gestures made still more 
fantastic by his apparent ability 
to throw each limb out of joint. 

One of the gestures, delivered as 
if from a pitcher’s mound, sent his 
forefinger streaking out by triveo 
magic so it seemed to be only an 
inch from the viewer’s nose. Then 
the outthrust arm and finger moved 
to the southwest and its owner’s 
comic high-pitched voice would 
say to a stooge with the utmost 
scorn: “Aw, g’wan outside /” 

The gesture and the gag line 
were used several times during the 
program and it was obvious that 
these had helped to win him a spot 
on the City-State Network. It also 
was obvious that a new catch phrase 
had been bom and that the Donns 
could expect to hear it often from 
amateur comedians among their 
acquaintances. 

M ark olafson had to be 

careful now. He had to use the 
utmost caution while appearing to 
be casual. Moving by night, it 
hadn’t been too hard to cross open 
country undetected into the town 
on the outskirts of the City-State. 
From there, by stages, he had 
traveled nearly to the west bank of 
the Hudson River.

At the bus terminal, Mark went 
to the men’s room and, waiting for 
a moment when he was alone, 
quickly but carefully redusted his 
face with talcum to hide the red- 
ness of the skin that marked him as 
a man from Outside. That done, 
he rubbed the excess off his hands 
and adjusted his borrowed clothing. 

It was the best in the village and 
it had been pooled from among 
various owners for his mission. The 
village’s best was only a seedy 
approximation of the everyday 
clothing of those he was among 
now. He pulled a telltale burr from 
the pants leg, wiped the shoes, ad- 
justed the hat and, taking a deep 
breath, walked out into the termi- 
nal. 

Mark ignored the moving pave- 
ment as being too open to scrutiny, 
and too slow. He bought a ticket to 
Timesquare and found the right 
bus. There were plenty of empty 
seats and he chose one in the back 
next to a window and tried to sink 
into it inconspicuously. 

He saw the bus driver look back 
in his direction and he averted his 
eyes quickly. The driver seemed to 
be staring at him, but finally turned 
back. A few more people got on. 
No one sat beside him, luckily. The 
driver started the engine, closed the 
doors and the bus moved out onto 
the ramp leading to the tunnel 
under the river. 

Oren Donn was sitting in his 
temperature-controlled, windowless 
office trying to decide whether to 
use good old reliable Smithson, 
with his fine familiar voice, to read 
the new pot-boiling historical ro- 

12 



mance into the tapes, or to experi- 
ment with a new voice, when the 
reception screen announced a visi- 
tor. 

Oren pushed the papers to a cor- 
ner of his desk and got up to 
greet the caller. The name, Mark 
Olafson, sounded familiar but he 
couldn’t quite place it. But the 
man’s face and the handclasp he 
gave him brought it all back. 

“Mark!” said Oren. ’’You old 
scoundrel! I haven’t seen you since 
school.” 

“That’s right,” the visitor said. 
He looked around the quiet, effi- 
cient office and dropped into a 
heavy lounge chair. “Hope you 
don’t mind, I’m about beat.” He 
sighed. “Been traveling.” He looked 
carefully at Oren. 

“Make yourself at home,” Oren 
said. “Brothers of the Oath don’t 
stand on ceremony.” 

Mark Olafson laughed. “Remem- 
ber that, do you? It’s been a long 
time since that schoolboy binge. 
You were pretty crocked.” 

Oren pretended to look hurt. 
“Held my liquor as well as a cer- 
tain other eighteen-year-old I could 
name.” 

“Good old Donnie,” said Mark. 
“Does the oath still hold?” He was 
serious suddenly. 

“Of course.” Oren looked at his 
visitor’s clothing. He saw the rubbed 
places in the cloth and the worn 
shoe-soles. “I don’t have a lot of 
cash with me, but you’re welcome 
to what I’ve got — and I’ll be here 
tomorrow.” 

Mark grinned. “That’s more than 
I can say. Thanks, Donnie, but it’s 
not money I need. Principally I 

RICHARD WILSON 




need a friend — someone I can 
trust — a brother.” 

“Just a minute.” Oren lifted a 
section of his desk and pressed a 
button. 

Mark jumped to his feet. 

Oren looked surprised. “Just 
wiping the tape. Don’t be alarmed. 
I start it up in the morning and re- 
cord all conversations. It’s just a 
business gimmick.” 

“Does it go anywhere else?” 
Mark asked. 

“No. I have it for my con- 
venience. Lots of people do. Helps 
you remember things, if you’ve got 
a memory like mine. Here, take the 
spool. There’s nothing important 
on it today.” He unhooked it and 
handed it to his visitor. 

“I’m sorry,” Mark said. He sank 
back into the chair. I’ve got a case 
of nerves.” He took out a handker- 
chief and wiped his face. Some of 
the talcum came off. “You see, I’m 
from Outside.” 

“Oh.” Oren looked grave and 
drummed on the desktop with his 
fingers. “That’s where you’ve been. 
Pretty grim, I imagine.” 

“Yes and no. It depends on what 
you’re used to — and what you 
want. For instance, I’m used to not 
having much — but I want a great 
deal. Does that sound paradoxical?” 

“Yes.” 

“It’s not, really,” said Mark. “I 
don’t have time to go into it right 
now, but one day we’ll have a yam 
about it. In the meantime, old 
brother, what I need are clothes 
that will get me by without sus- 
picion, s^me kind of cosmetic to 
cover up my ruddy outdoor face 
that’ll stay put for more than half 

IT'S COLD OUTSIDE 



an hour, and your solemn promise 
not to say a word to anyone — not 
even your wife, if you’ve got one.” 
“I have. She’s Edith Riordan 
Donn, the composer.” 

“So she’s your wife? Well con- 
gratulations. We hear her music 
out there, once in a while. ‘The 
Storm that Wasn’t,’ for instance. 
Good subversive stuff.” 

Oren wasn’t sure this was a joke. 
“Look, Mark,” he said, “I’ll help 
you all I can. I give you my word, 
which should be superfluous. I’ll 
bring the clothes and the makeup 
and I won’t say anything to any- 
body. But because I do have a 
family — there’s my little boy, too — 
I don’t want ...” 

“I understand,” his visitor said. 
“Don’t worry. I’m deeply grateful 
and I wish I didn’t have to be so 
mysterious. But that irt itself helps 
protect you. And I’d go a long way 
toward Death to avoid involving 
you and your family. I mean that.” 
Oren felt a thrill of vicarious 
adventure, but it was short lived. 
“I believe you,” he said. “Shall I 
bring the clothes and things to- 
morrow. Here?” 

“If you will. It’s a busy office 
building, with people coming and 
going all day. Better than my going 
to your house, or meeting you some- 
place else.” Mark Olafson stood up. 
“Now I’ve got to run. I’m very 
grateful to you.” 

Oren waved away the gratitude. 
“Tell me,” he said. “Do you 
think — ? I mean if my family and 
I—” 

Mark Olafson’s glance was keen 
but impersonal as it swept up from 
Oren’s good clothes to his pale, 

13 




well-fed face and around the 
luxurious, gadgeted office. 

“Somehow, Donnie/’ he said. “I 
don’t think you’d like it out there.” 

Martin was a very good baby. 

He never cried, never was any 
trouble. He was sent to them in an 
ambulance (“Delivery truck!” Oren 
called it) from the hospital. He 
arrived in a cage of glass called a 
Sleeprplay. It was to be his home 
till he outgrew it. The thing regu- 
lated the temperature to the baby’s 
needs, kept out insects, bathed him 
with anti-germ beams and made 
him inaccessible to random pats, 
cuddles and chin-chucks. 

There was also a switch they 
could have used to soundproof the 
cabinet if Martin had been too 
noisy. But even if he had been the 
worst wailer in the world they 
wouldn’t have considered using it 
against him, they said, and won- 
dered who would be so heartless. 

But though they derided the glass 
box, they found it a useful improve- 
ment over the old-fashioned crib 
and play pen. And much more 
sanitary. 

There was a Chango at one end 
of the gadget. Oren never quite 
lost his fear that it would swallow 
up his son whole one day. It was 
operated by plunging the baby into 
it up to his waist and holding him 
there. Then, behind the scenes, the 
old diaper was stripped off, the 
baby washed and oiled and a new, 
pinless diaper fastened to his loins. 
The whole operation took thirty- 
seven seconds and the manufac- 
turers were looking for a safe 
short-cut which would reduce the 

14 



time to half a minute flat. But they 
hadn’t yet found anything to make 
the diaper itself obsolete. 

Martin was so little trouble that 
they sometimes forgot he was in 
the house. He ate without fuss and 
slept well and the glass box dis- 
couraged much playing. 

So Edith had plenty of time for 
her music. She worked hard and, 
sometimes when the baby was asleep 
and the piano was making a great 
racket, she would soundproof the 
Sleeprplay so he wouldn’t be dis- 
turbed. 

But she was often discouraged 
in the evenings when Oren returned 
from work and soon he found it 
was better not to question her 
about her progress. Tonight he had 
tickets to a theater. It was a sur- 
prise for her — a dance act was go- 
ing to use some of her old music. 

She met him at the door and, 
before he could tell her about the 
tickets, she threw herself at him 
with a hug that almost tumbled 
him off his feet. 

“What’s up, Edie?” he asked. 
“Martin been doing something 
precocious?” 

He sometimes was bitter about 
their son; about the machine-like 
way in which he was progressing, 
without mishap, through infancy. 
And he always called the baby 
Martin, never Marty or any pet 
name. 

“Now you stop that,” Edith told 
him. “This isn’t about the baby at 
all ; it’s about me.” 

“All right. I’ll be good,” he said. 
He followed his wife into the 
studio. 

She sat him down in a resto- 
RICHARD WILSON 




chair, handed him a highball and 
went to the piano. “Now don’t be 
too critical,” she said. “This is just 
the theme, with a few embellish- 
ments.” 

She sat for a moment with her 
hands poised over the keyboard, 
and then began to play. 

There were five majestic notes 
at the beginning. Edith wove them 
powerfully into a statement which 
spoke authoritatively of revelations 
to come. Her right hand was the 
harbinger of the calm future, her 
left the evoker of monumental dis- 
cord, raging in the dying throes of 
the tortured present. There was 
strength in her playing and mean- 
ing in the music. It stirred him 
even on this first hearing. 

There was a kinship here with 
Beethoven, he thought, in the feel- 
ing, and yet it would be unfair to 
make a comparison on any other 
basis. He had sense enough not to 
mention it. 

She finished on a chord that 
echoed away in the big room, then 
picked up a pencil and made a 
change in the rough score propped 
on the stand beside her. 

Oren’s face was serious when 
Edith looked at him. 

“Not so hot, was it?” she said. 

“Edie,” he said, “you couldn’t 
be more wrong. It’s tremendous. 
I’m impressed more than I can say. 
I’m an old duffer about music — 
all I know is what I like — but you 
tell me I have good taste in good 
stuff. This is good stuff, Edie. It’s 
the real thing.” 

She went to sit next to him. 

“Do you really think so? Don’t 
give me any malarky, Oren — not 

ITS COLD OUTSIDE 



about this. It’s too important to 

if 

me. 

“Of course it is,” he said. “And 
it’s going to be important to a lot 
more people, I think. Did this all 
happen today?” 

“Sort of. It all went together to- 
day. I’ve had the theme — those 
first five notes — going through my 
mind for a week or more. I’d feel 
them pounding through me when 
I was doing something altogether 
irrelevant — Tike dipping Marty into 
the Chango, or hydrating his for- 
mula — but they didn’t come out 
until I sat down at the piano to- 
day. Then there they were. They 
just came out of my fingers. I 
didn’t even write them down, at 
first; they were so much a part of 
me I knew I’d never lose them.” 
“That’s wonderful,” he said. 
Then he asked: “Where do you 
think it came from?” 

“What do you mean? The 
music? I wrote it, of course.” 

“Of course you did. I mean, 
do you think it has anything to 
do with the Stem theory? The one 
about non-babying helping women 
create? You’re a generation ahead 
of his schedule, if there’s anything 
to it.” 

“I think his theory is a lot of 
egotistical male nonsense,” Edith 
said. “The only reason women 
haven’t become great musicians or 
artists — or generals, for that matter 
— is that we never got a chance to 
show what we could do. Not till 
lately, anyhow. Remember, it’s 
been less than a century since 
women were permitted to emerge 
from the cocoons that the men had 
spun for them.” 

15 




Oren smiled but said nothing. 

“My theory is that Dr. Stern is 
just a crackpot/’ Edith said. “It’s 
a matter of environment and op- 
portunity, that’s all. Otherwise why 
did it take man so long to write his 
first novel from the time he spoke 
his first intelligible grunt as a cave- 
man? I wrote that music myself, 
without any mystic help from a 
sublimated sex urge. And I’d have 
written it just as well if Marty had 
been born in me instead of in a 
laboratory.” 

“Good for you,” he said. “Then 
we’ve got a reason for celebrating.” 
He told her about the theater 
tickets. She was pleased and ran 
to dress. 

The dance act wasn’t good and 
Edith’s music seemed to her to be 
badly played by the orchestra. But 
it was an evening out and Edith 
squeezed Oren’s hand to reassure 
him. 

They hadn’t expected to see a 
movie, too, but the curtains parted 
after intermission and there it was, 
in Ultra-Dimension, Authenticolor 
and Tactilivity, presented as a 
public service by the Department 
of Information, Greater New York. 

A breath of cooled, somewhat 
rancid air swept across the audience 
and the sound apparatus played a 
stylized theme borrowed from a 
Tin Pan Alley relic that Edith 
recognized at “Baby, It’s Cold 
Outside.” The title of the film, 
formed by blocks of ice, was, 
simply, Outside . 

The movie purported to be a 
travelog but they recognized it as 
propaganda. Nevertheless, after two 
reels of cineramic proximity to the 

16 



gaunt, sullen-looking people who 
had chosen to live beyond the bless- 
ings of the City-States, they de- 
cided they were extremely fortunate 
to be living where they were. 

Oren, in addition, had the recent 
memory of Mark Olafson. His 
caller, whp had been so nervous, so 
suspicious in the office, might easily 
have been one of the people in the 
film. 

“That’s not for me,” Oren said 
later. “That’s going back two hun- 
dred years — going Outside. Those 
shacks they live in — what did the 
commentator call them, quaint? — 
they’re not quaint, they’re primi- 
tive.” 

“I suppose that is the impression 
we’re expected to go away with,” 
Edith said. “But I don’t see how 
we could have any other. The 
cameras don’t lie. If that’s freedom, 
they’ve changed the definition and 
they can have it.” 

Oren recalled Mark Olafson’s 
words. No, he and Edith wouldn’t 
like it out there. 



T HE SYMPHONY went slowly 
for a time. But its progress was 
steady. Edith knew what she wanted 
to say through the music and she 
said it forcefully. Sometimes the 
statement came originally at her 
piano as she sat and coaxed the 
black and white keys to express 
a phrase that was throbbing 
through her body. 

At other times whole passages 
suggested themselves to Edith with 
such clarity that the piano was 
superfluous. 

The third movement was a 
RICHARD WILSON 




revelation. The entire theme of it 
suggested itself to her in one 
brilliant mass as she was coming 
home from a department store sale. 
She was riding the moving pave- 
ment, clutching a few parcels she 
hadn’t wanted to entrust to the 
delivery tubes and hemmed in by a 
crowd of other women shoppers. 
There, one flight underground, 
moving north at the speed of fif- 
teen miles an hour and trying to 
ignore the advertising placards set 
into the tunnel ceiling at an angle 
just overhead, she felt the music 
hit her. 

It came not as a phrase or snatch 
— not as a tender seedling thrust- 
ing hopefully through a crack it had 
made in the soil — but full-blown, 
like the bouquet of flowers a ma- 
gician would produce from an 
empty fist. 

The movement exploded in her 
mind, in a fraction of a second, 
fully-developed. It was a natural 
outgrowth of the first and second 
movements, over which she had 
worked so hard, and, although it 
was similar to them thematically, 
it was a totally original concept of 
their potentials. It was as if the 
first two had mated and produced 
the third, spontaneously and per- 
fectly. 

Edith was transfixed as the music 
throbbed through her. She was 
carried two exits beyond her own 
before she realized it and then in 
her excitement elbowed her way to 
the slow lane and off, where she 
took the escalator to the street. 

She walked home from there, 
quickly. She was running when the 
front door cushioned closed behind 



her. She threw the parcels to a 
couch, dropped her coat to a floor, 
sailed her hat across the room and 
was at the piano. 

She was still at the piano, the 
floor around her littered with pa- 
per and pencil stubs and the ash- 
trays piled with cigaret butts, when 
her husband came home. 

“Hi, Edie,” he said. “How’s the 
baby?” 

She was irritated that his first 
thought should be of the child. But 
then she said : 

“Oh my God! The baby!” 

“What’s the matter?” Oren 
asked. Alarmed, he headed for the 
nursery. 

She followed him. “I plugged 
his sleeper into the sitter connec- 
tion when I went shopping and 
when I came home — frankly I for- 
got all about him.” 

Martin was asleep, peacefully. If 
he was damp he didn’t show it or 
object. 

“What a terrible mother I am,” 
Edith said. Anxiously she pressed a 
button and a voice said, almost 
instantly: 

“Nursaway, Incorporated. Every- 
thing was just fine while you were 
gone. One moment, please.” 

That was just Tape A, but it 
did mean there had been no 
trouble; no need to send a nurse 
in person from the central sitter 
office. 

“Electronic nursemaids,” Oren 
snorted. He was about to elaborate 
when a viewscreen which could be 
seen from the baby’s Sleeprplay 
went alight. The image of a young 
woman in a crisp white uniform 
appeared. She said: 



ITS COLD OUTSIDE

“Martin was wonderful while 
you were gone. He slept most of 
the time. Once he got a bit cranky, 
but we ran off a puppet film on the 
screen, which amused him, and 
then played a Soothe-tune. He went 
back to sleep. You have a very fine 
baby, Mrs. Donn.” 

“Yes, I know,” Edith said. 
“Thank you.” 

“Will there be anything else?” 

“No. Thank you very much, 
Nurse.” 

“Thank you.” 

The screen darkened and Edith 
plugged out the connection. 

“So everything’s under control,” 
Oren said. “I’ll change him and 
feed him later, if you like.” They 
went back to the studio. “You seem 
to be busy.” He looked around at 
the mess. 

She laughed and curled up on 
the couch, moving the parcels to 
the floor. 

“You have no idea,” she said. 
“I’ve been going like a mad one all 
afternoon. And the reason why? 
This will kill you.” She spoke self- 
consciously. “Your strictly no- talent 
wife thinks she has something good. 
She thinks she has it and she may 
not lose it, if only she keeps work- 
ing at it like fury so as to keep it 
from getting away.” 

“Of course you’ve got some- 
thing,” he said. “We both know 
that.” 

“But this is different. It’s the 
third movement. It’s all there. Part 
of it’s down on paper — there,” she 
pointed her chin at a mass of pa- 
pers on the piano top, “and part of 
it’s up here.” She rapped her skull 
with her knuckles. “Or down here,” 

18 



she added. “I seem to feel it in my 
stomach, too. Is that the way great 
music is written — with the stom- 
ach?” 

“I don’t know,” Oren said. “But 
if that’s the way you write, that’s 
the way you write.” 

“Well, this is ulcer music. Maybe 
I’ll give it a name. Symphony 
Number 1 by Edith Donn, subtitled 
The Brain and the Ulcer.’ ” 

“Good,” he said. “Now you’re 
relaxing. I’ll get us a drink and you 
knock off for the day so you can go 
at it fresh in the morning.” 

“Thanks,” she said. “I’ll take the 
drink, but I’ve got to get back to 
this. I can’t risk losing it. If you 
don’t mind getting your own sup- 
per, that is? I don’t think I want 
anything.” 

He came back from the portable 
bar and handed her a drink. 

“In the old days I’d have blown 
my stack,” he said, grinning. 
“Work hard all day and then have 
to stand over a hot stove while my 
wife makes merry in the music 
room. But even though I’m Apolo- 
gist Number One for the old-fash- 
ioned way, I must admit this mod- 
ern cooking has grandma’s methods 
beat all to hell.” 

“You know how to do it, don’t 
you?” his wife asked. “The freezer’s 
full of all kinds of meals. All you 
have to do . .” 

“I know,” he said. “From the 
freezer into the Electronicook and 
orito the table in ten seconds flat. 
Then into me, and what’s left into 
the Disposo. But just to be per- 
verse, I think I’ll have a couple of 
medieval sandwiches. If I fix you 
some and tiptoe in quietly with 

RICHARD WILSON 





them, you’ll eat them, won’t you?” 
“You’re a darling,” Edith said. 
She gave him a quick kiss and went 
to the piano. “Yes, I will.” 

At twenty-three thirty Oren 
Donn came out of the shower and 
peeked into the studio. Edith was 
still hard at work. 

He wrote a note, tiptoed in and 
put it on the piano top : 

“Baby’s all tucked away. Now 
I’m tucking myself away. Please 
come to bed soon.” 



glance, smiled, blew him a kiss and 
nodded vaguely. 

When he awoke the next morn- 
ing the first thing he was conscious 
of was the muted sounds of the 
piano. 

He went in to her. 

“Honey, for God’s sake!” 

Her face was pale and drawn 
but her eyes were bright. She would 
play a few bars, then write a line of 
notes in quick, expert strokes. 
There was a little box of tabodex 



She read the note at a quick on the piano top next to a glass. 



ITS COLD OUTSIDE

“I’m fine,” Edith said. “Don’t 
worry about me. It’s a bit tricky in 
spots, but it’s really coming along.” 

“You’ve got to slow down — have 
some rest,” he protested. “I won’t 
let you do this to yourself.” 

“No,” she said. “The music is 
more important. You run along. 
With luck, I’ll be through with this 
movement by the time you’re 
home.” 

He conceded defeat, respecting 
her judgment and sense of values 
as she had always respected his. 

“All right, but don’t overdo it. 
I’ll make you some scrambled eggs 
and coffee. And I’m going to call 
Nursaway and get a sitter for Mar- 
tin so you won’t be disturbed. Ex- 
cept that she’ll be instructed to feed 
you lunch — forcibly if necessary.” 

Edith put down her pencil, got 
to her feet, put her arms around 
him and rested her head on his 
chest. 

“I just want to tell you,” she said 
softly, “that you’re the most won- 
derful, perfect, sensational, ter- 
rifically colossal person in the whole 
world and I love you love you love 
you love you.” Her tears wet the 
skin of his chest in the V of his 
bathrobe. “Thank you for you,” 
she whispered. 

He kissed the top of her head 
and then on each wet cheek and 
gently on the mouth. 

“Okay,” he said, considerably 
affected. “Okay, fine. I’ll go fix the 
eggs. And you write this thing 
good, Edie. Give it hell, Sweet- 
heart. Give it hell.” 

Oren pushed open the door of 
the apartment that night and 

20 



called : 

“Edith. Edie!” 

He went into the studio, but it 
was empty — and clean. The piano 
lid was down. The ashtrays were 
empty and sparkling. The papers 
were gone from the floor. 

“Edie!” he cried. 

A nurse in starched white came 
from the bedroom. She had her fin- 
ger to her lips. 

“She’s in bed, Mr. Donn. I tried 
to call you at the office, but they 
told me you’d just left.” 

“What is it? What’s the matter?” 

“It’s all right. Strain and fatigue 
is about all. I’ve given her a seda- 
tive and she’s sleeping now. Dr. 
Harrons is on his way, but just as a 
precaution.” 

He pushed past the nurse and 
into the bedroom. Edith lay quietly 
in the center of the double bed, 
breathing just a bit heavily. He 
stood at the edge of the bed, look- 
ing at her. 

The nurse followed him. She put 
her hand on Edith’s forehead, in a 
gesture which she combined with 
the smoothing of the sleeping wom- 
an’s hair, adjusted the covers and 
turned to smile at Oren. 

“I’m sure there’s nothing to 
worry about,” she said. 

“Poor kid,” Oren said. 

“I put her to bed,” the nurse 
said. “And called you and the doc- 
tor. But as I said, it’s just strain, 
I’m sure.” 

“Thank you, Miss Loring. I guess 
you didn’t bargain for all this when 
you came to baby-sit.” 

“I’m glad I could help,” she said. 
“Would you like me to fix you some 
coffee or anything while we wait

for the doctor?” 

“No, thanks. Fll go visit with 
Martin, I think, till he gets here. 
Has the baby been good?” 

“Perfect,” she said. “A real doll.” 
His son was asleep. Oren sat and 
looked at him and worried about 
Edith. 

Doctor Harrons was packing his 
things away in his bag. He refused 
a drink but accepted one of Oren’s 
cigarets and sat down in a straight- 
backed chair. Oren stood and 
fidgeted in front of him. 

“It’s as Miss Loring said.” The 
doctor took out a prescription kit. 
“Fatigue, mostly. Your wife was 
driving herself on borrowed energy 
— she’d taken a few of those Tabo- 
dex things, you know. Perfectly all 
right, of course, occasionally, but 
you do have to let yourself catch 
up afterwards. Mrs. Donn just 
went a bit too far before allowing 
herself to catch up. A good night’s 
rest and a minimum of activity to- 
morrow and she’ll be as good as 
new. Who is your regular doctor?” 
“We don’t have one. We had Dr. 
Morales, but he was just the obby 
— the obstetrician for the baby. A 
laboratory baby, of course.” 

“Good man, Morales, in his field. 
But I would suggest another in this 
case. I mean no criticism of 
Morales whatsoever, but he is a 
specialist. He’d be the first to tell 
you so himself. No, if I may make a 
recommendation, I’d say Dr. Leif.” 
“If you say so,” Oren said. “I 
suppose you’re too busy to take on 
another patient yourself?” 

The doctor carefully ground out 
his cigaret in an ashtray. He looked 

ITS COLD OUTSIDE 



at Oren, began a smile, then 
stopped it in the middle. 

“Mr. Donn,” he said, “apparent- 
ly I have news for you. Have a 
drink yourself, Mr. Donn. Your 
wife is pregnant.” 

Oren stiffened. His face went 
through a series of contortions as it 
adjusted itself to the emotions chas- 
ing around behind it. He ended his 
confusion by breaking out into a 
broad grin. 

“Pregnant!” he cried. “You mean 
pregnant? You mean she’s going to 
have a baby? The way people used 
to do? The old-fashioned way? 
Naturally?” 

“Naturally,” said Dr. Harrons, 
grinning back. 

“Oh, boy!” Oren exploded. “Oh, 
boy-oh-boy! That’s wonderful!” He 
walked up and down the room in 
excitement. “Pregnant! Imagine 
that! The little devil! Doctor, I’m 
going to have a drink and you’re 
going to have one with me.” 

“Well,” the doctor said, “all 
right. Just a weak one.” 

Edith slept through the night. 

Oren sent word to his office that 
he was taking the day off and he 
was anxiously hovering over his 
wife when she stirred into wakeful- 
ness. 

“Hello, Maw,” he said when her 
eyes opened. 

“Hello, darling,” she said. She 
stretched out a hand to him and he 
put it to his lips. It was warm and 
soft. “I feel so lazy and relaxed,” 
she said. 

“It’s about time,” he said. “And 
that’s the way you’re going to stay.” 

“Oh, but I can’t. I have so much 

21 




work to do. I’ve— ” She frowned 
and looked around the sunlit room. 
“It’s morning/’ she said. “I don’t 
remember going to bed. What hap- 
pened?” 

“It’s all right. Just relax.” 

“But it’s not all right. I have 
work to do. I have to finish the 
symphony. I have a lot of work to 
do.” 

“You finished it,” he said. “You 
finished it last night. Before I came 
home.” 

She frowned down at the covers. 
“I remember now. Yes, I did finish. 
But that was only the third move- 
ment. It was good. It came out all 
right, Oren. I remember. But I 
don’t remember after that. Did I 
fall asleep in the studio?” 

“Yes,” he said. “And the baby- 
sitter put you to bed. You were 
knocked out.” 

“Well, I’m not knocked out any 
more. I’ve got to get right up and 
start the last movement. That’s go- 
ing to be a humdinger to tackle. 
I’ve got no ideas whatsoever. The 
third took everything out of me.” 
“So I hear,” he said. “Now you 
listen to me. You’re going to stay in 
bed all day. That’s an order. Doc- 
tor’s order. Maybe tonight, if you’re 
very good, you can get up for a lit- 
tle while. But not before. You’ve 
got to take care of yourself. You 
owe it to the baby.” 

“Poor Marty. I’ve certainly been 
neglecting him. All right, I’ll be 
good. I’ll stay in bed and behave. 
And maybe you’ll bring him in and 
he can stay with me, the way he’s 
never had a chance to, in that 
damned old scientific box of his all 
the time.” 

22 



“Edith Riordan Donn,” he said 
to her, grinning. “Mrs. Oren Donn, 
I want you to stop talking like an 
idiot. The doctor has been here, 
and he’s told me everything, and 
there’s no point in your trying to 
hide it any longer because I know. 
I, your husband Mr. Donn. I 
know.” 

“Know what, silly? What doc- 
tor? What are you talking about?” 
“You know perfectly well what 
I’m — Don’t you? You mean you 
don’t know? Don’t you really?” 

She laughed. “No, I don’t. And 
if you keep mumbling to yourself 
like a fool I never will. What are 
you talking about?” 

He took both her hands in his 
and said: 

“Edie, darling. The doctor was 
here. He examined you after you 
passed out. He said you’d been 
overworking yourself. He said you 
need a rest. But he also said — He 
said, and I think it’s wonderful — he 
said we’re going to have a baby.” 
She looked at him, her eyes wide. 
“Oh, no!” she said. 

She withdrew one of her hands 
and pulled it down the side of her 
face. 

“Not no, yes. We’re going to be 
real live parents. No bowl of mush 
stuff, with all due respect to Mar- 
tin, but an honest-to-God old-fash- 
ioned baby.” 

Her staring eyes were focused on 
nothing. When she spoke again her 
voice was barely audible. 

“Now I’ll never finish the sym- 
phony,” she said. “It’s no good any 
more. I can’t do it now.” 

“Silly girl,” he said. “You sound 
like Dr. Stern. Surely you can’t 

RICHARD WILSON 




agree with him now. You can have 
your baby and your symphony both. 
You can have a dozen babies and 
write a dozen symphonies, if you 
want to.” 

“No,” she said dully. “Not now. 
I was talking a lot of bravado then. 
Now I’m just an ordinary woman, 
like all the rest. We can’t do two 
things at once. We’re strictly one- 
track people. It’s our fate.” 

“Fate hell!” Oren exploded. 
“What a lot of nonsense you’re 
talking. You did three movements, 
didn’t you? You can do anything 
you want to do, if you’ll only get 
out of this defeatist frame of 
mind.” 

“You’re shouting at me.” She 
looked at him, her eyes grown cold. 
“You did this thing to me and now 
you’re shouting at me.” Her voice 
rose and she had a wild look. 
“You’re jealous of my work. I was 
doing something creative and you 
weren’t and now you’re jealous of 
my work and you’re trying to de- 
stroy it. That’s why I’m pregnant. 
You did it on purpose. You did it 
maliciously. Well, I won’t let you 
destroy my music. I’ll destroy your 
child first!” 

She thrust the bedclothes aside 
and got unsteadily to her feet. He 
sprang up to help her. She shoved 
him aside, with more strength than 
he thought she possessed. 

“Honey,” he said. 

“Hypocrite!” she yelled. She 
clawed a dress from a hanger in the 
closet, gathered together other 
clothing and ran to the bathroom, 
where she locked the door against 
him. He pounded on it. 

“Edie,” he said. “You’re sick. 

ITS COLD OUTSIDE 



Open the door. Come back to bed. 
I’ll call the doctor.” 

“You needn’t bother,” she said. 
“I’m going to the doctor. I’m go- 
ing to have an abortion.” 

Oren, pale and shaking, went to 
the communicator. He set it for 
private and whispered: 

“Medical emergency.” 

A minute later the bathroom 
door opened and Edith came out, 
dressed for the street. Her face was 
ashen under its makeup. She car- 
ried her purse in her left hand and 
behind it she was shielding some- 
thing she held in her right hand. 

Oren stood at the front door, 
barring her way. 

“You’re not going out,” he said 
softly. “Please, darling, be reason- 
able.” 

She walked toward him. She 
lifted the purse so he could see the 
large pair of scissors in her other 
hand, the point of one blade just 
touching her body. 

“Open the door, my dear hus- 
band,” she said. “Let me go out.” 
He hesitated only a moment, 
watching her mad eyes, then 
opened the door for her. 

T HEY BROUGHT her back on 
a stretcher ten minutes later. 
She was unconscious. At Oren’s 
gesture the two men carrying the 
stretcher took it into the bedroom 
and the young medical officer with 
the gold badge on his white tunic 
helped them transfer her to the 
bed. 

“Preventive paralysis,” the of- 
ficer said to Oren. “She’s all right. 
We tracked her from the street door 

23 




as soon as we got your call and 
made contact in person a minute 
or two later.” 

“But you had to use the para 
ray?” Oren asked. 

“She was carrying those shears 
and we couldn’t take a chance. She 
seemed to be wandering aimlessly 
until she saw us. Then she began to 
run and we pre-parred her. No one 
saw and Dr. Soames caught her as 
she fell. There’ll be no publicity, I 
think I can assure you.” 

“Thank God for that.” Oren 
knelt by the bed and pushed a lock 
of hair away from his wife’s face. 
She was breathing peacefully and 
the mad look had gone. 

“There will be a few questions, 
though, if we can go into the next 
room. Dr. Soames will see that Mrs. 
Donn is made comfortable.” 
“Questions?” 

“Just routine,” the medical of- 
ficer said. “For the department rec- 
ords. Confidential, of course.” He 
took Oren’s elbow and guided him 
out of the bedroom. 

The questions, if routine, were 
extensive. At one point Oren angri- 
ly crushed out a cigaret and said: 
“What is this, anyway? You 
make it sound like a police matter. 
If we’re charged with anything let 
me know and I’ll get a lawyer. I 
don’t like this inquisition.” 

“Well, now,” soothed the med- 
ical officer, “you know that there’s 
often a very fine line of demarca- 
tion between a medical case and a 
police matter. Our department 
must have the facts if the case is to 
be closed.” 

“Don’t call it a ‘case.’ You make 
me sorry I ever called you.” 

24 



“You might have been sorrier if 
you hadn’t,” the officer said coldly, 
his affability slipping for a moment 
“Our job is to safeguard all the 
citizenry and it’s people like you 
who make things difficult.” 

Oren jumped to his feet. 

“Listen, you young squirt,” he 
began. But Soames came from the 
bedroom then and after a grave 
look at Oren whispered into the 
officer’s ear. 

The medical officer frowned. 

“What is it?” asked Oren. 
“What’s wrong?” 

“Mr. Donn,” the officer said re- 
proachfully, “you didn’t tell us your 
wife was pregnant.” 

“You didn’t give me a chance to, 
with your stupid questions. Well, 
what of it?” 

“We should have had that fact 
in our possession at the time we an- 
swered your emergency call,” the 
officer said sententiously. “Then we 
would have proceeded differently. 
As it is, you must take responsi- 
bility.” 

“Responsibility for what? What 
do you mean?” 

“I mean this. Preventive paralysis 
is harmless, generally speaking, but 
its effect on a foetus or embryo is 
not completely known and may 
even be harmful. Therefore we dis- 
claim responsibility for any injury 
or mutation which may occur in 
the course of this natural birth. I 
have a form here which I must ask 
you to sign, to absolve the de- 
partm — ” 

That was when Oren socked him 
in the jaw. 

It was thirty-six hours before the 
RICHARD WILSON 




Donn household was back nearly to 
normal. 

Oren had been under house ar- 
rest for twenty-four of those hours. 
During that time the house had 
been aswarm with Council 
Guards, medics and medical of- 
ficers, a lawyer, nurses, a baby-sit- 
ter and reporters from half a dozen 
news media. One reporter carrying 
a creepy-peepy sent the scene out 
for triveo. 

Finally all of them had gone ex- 
cept Oren’s lawyer, in whose 
custody he was paroled. 

“Not only don’t they have a case, 
Oren,” the lawyer said, “but you 
might have a strong action against 
the Council. I say this in the strict- 
ly legal sense, of course, without 
consideration of such extra-legal lit- 
x tle gimmicks such as Suggestions 
and Resolutions they could whip 
out at the spur of a moment, and 
assuming that they’d allow a suit. 
I imagine, though, that all you 
want is peace and privacy again.” 

“Exactly, Burt,” Oren said. He 
kicked at a fax tabloid whose head- 
line screamed: 

“MUSIC HER BABY” 
—SCISSOR PSYCHO 

“You could sue that sheet, at 
least,” Burt said. 

“Forget it.” 

The bedroom door opened. Oren 
pushed the tabloid under the couch 
with his toe as he got to his feet. 

Edith came in, wearing a hostess 
gown and smiling uncertainly. 

“Hello, darling,” she said. “Hel- 
lo, Burt. I’ve been a bad girl, 
haven’t I?” 



Oren went to her and led her to 
the couch. She was a bit unsteady 
on her feet. She relaxed gratefully. 

“We’re not going to talk about 
anything unpleasant tonight,” her 
husband said. “We’ll pretend that 
Burt is here on one of his rare so- 
cial evenings.” 

They pretended as best they 
could but it was not a success. Oren 
was worried about his wife’s condi- 
tion and was not talkative. Edith, 
who had not been told there was 
anything to worry about, was pale 
under her makeup and wore a fixed 
half-smile which soon choked off 
Burt’s attempts at conversation. 

So in desperation they switched 
on the triveo. 

It was Jerry Hilarious night and 
the scarlet-haired comedian was in 
rare form. 

His material usually was topical, 
and tonight it was right up to the 
minute. They had turned him on 
in the middle of a routine which 
obviously was a parody of the Donn 
case. Since they had missed the be- 
ginning, it wasn’t too clear what 
was going on, but in the act with 
Jerry Hilarious were a couple wear- 
ing heavy glasses — which he had 
made symbolic of the intellectuals 
the City-State so despised. More- 
over, the girl was wearing as a 
costume a print dress polka-dotted 
with music notes and a hat that 
was a grand piano, while the man, 
obviously a snob, carried a heavy 
old-fashioned book under his arm. 

“Oh, he’s subtle,” said Burt. 
“Subtle as a kick in the teeth. Shall 
I turn him off?” 

“No,” said Oren. “We might as 
well see ourselves as The Common 



ITS COLD OUTSIDE 



25 




Man sees us — unless it upsets you, 
Edie?” 

“It’s all right,” she said. “It has a 
certain fascination.” 

The triveo couple, with Jerry 
Hilarious laughing it up in the 
foreground, were singing: 

“We don’t like the City-State 

But we think we are just first 
rate.” 

The couple, with their faces fixed 
in expressions of the utmost gravity, 
were going through a series of in- 
sane antics as they sang the verses, 
and the studio audience was roar- 
ing with laughter as Jerry Hilarious 
mugged, cross-eyed, and danced 
around the pair with his arms and 
legs flailing fantastically. 

The production ended with a 
crash of music and a sudden silence 
in which Jerry Hilarious wound up 
and let fly his gesture of banish- 
ment. 

“Aw, g’wan outside!” he cried. 

A wind machine went into ac- 
tion and, as it howled, snowflakes 
pelted the ridiculous, bespectacled 
couple. They cringed away from 
the gesture and crept toward an icy 
gate. 

Edith, with a switch next to the 
couch, cut off the triveo. Her ex- 
pression was angry and her lips 
were pressed into a firm line. 

“You know,” she said, “I’d like 
to do just that.” 



T HE DOCTORS— both the 
Health Department experts 
and the Donns’ private physician — 
couldn’t tell what the effect of the 

26 



para ray would be on Edith’s un- 
born child. It was alive, they 
agreed, but whether it would be 
normal after birth was something 
they could not yet say. They put her 
through a Diagnosticon, they 
thumped on her belly with fingers 
and X-steths, they examined smears 
and slides and dials and they said 
they’d be back to run some more 
tests when she was five months 
pregnant. It was thoroughly hu- 
miliating. 

Oren was tried on the assault 
charge. The trial was held in cham- 
bers with the press barred. Nothing 
had appeared anywhere about the 
fact that Edith was pregnant when 
she was rayed down by preventive 
paralysis and the Council intended 
that nothing should. The case was 
handled as one of simple assault 
and the judge sentenced Oren to a 
year in Correction, then suspended 
the sentence. He was free then, but 
from that time on the Donns were 
under surveillance. 

They planned one Restday to go 
on a gyro trip with a picnic lunch. 
They hadn’t ever made such a trip 
as a family unit, and little Marty 
seemed to sense their anticipation. 
His heels kicked against the lunch 
pack as they wheeled him the few 
blocks to the gyropark. But the 
plane wasn’t there. A hostile at- 
tendant, speaking from the back of 
his booth as if fearing contamina- 
tion, told them the Council Guards 
had confiscated it. 

Marty sensed their mood of frus- 
tration and bitterness as they 
wheeled him back home and he be- 
gan to cry. He was still crying when 
they reached the house and Oren 

RICHARD WILSON 




on an angry impulse put the infant 
in the Sleeprplay and cut off his 
yowls by turning the soundproof 
switch. Then Oren went intQ the 
study and turned on the artificial 
rain; the streams of water slammed 
against the window. But suddenly 
the sound stopped. He looked up 
and saw a Council Guard looking 
at him from outside the panes. The 
booted, green-tunicked guard mo- 
tioned to him to open the window. 

He did, and asked belligerently, 
“Did you turn that off ? 55 

“I did,” the guard said. “As you 
must be aware, there’s a Suggestion 
against artificial rain. In addition 
to being wasteful, it’s naturalistic.” 
The guard took out a pocket Lis- 
tener and aimed it at Oren. 

“I didn’t know about any such 
Suggestion,” Oren said. He was 
leaning out the window and talk- 
ing loudly to the guard standing in 
the garden below. “And if there is 
such a Suggestion, it’s petty tyran- 
ny.” 

“Oren Donn, with two n’s,” the 
guard said into the Listener. “And 
‘tyranny.’ That was the word you 
used, wasn’t it, Mr. Donn?” 

“Go to hell,” exploded Oren. 
“And get the hell out of my garden. 
You have no right here at all.” 
“And use of profanity to a guard 
in the performance of his duty,” 
the guard said. “People under sur- 
veillance are subject to loss of cer- 
tain rights. I’m sure that was ex- 
plained to you at the time of your 
trial.” 

Oren bit the inside of his cheek 
then, and was silent. The guard 
looked up at Oren, smiled faintly 
and put the Listener back in his 

IT'S COLD OUTSIDE 



pocket. 

“Nothing else to say, Mr. Donn. 
Too bad. I was enjoying your lec- 
ture, as I am sure the Council will 
when it is transcribed for them. 
Nice garden you have here. Very 
natural.” 

The guard turned and on his 
way to the gate at the back of the 
garden his heavy boots tramped 
through a border of moss roses. 

Oren bit off a little piece of the 
inside of his cheek. 

A man had been standing in the 
street beyond the garden, watching 
the scene, and he walked on leisure- 
ly as the guard left. The guard gave 
him a passing glance and disap- 
peared around a corner. Oren rec- 
ognized the man. Mark Olafson, 
the man from Outside. Oren was 
about to speak when Mark shook 
his head almost imperceptibly. 
Then he, too, disappeared from 
view. 

At his office the next day Oren 
spent the entire morning failing to 
get anything accomplished. Half a 
dozen times he began to tackle the 
correspondence that had accumu- 
lated over the weekend and half a 
dozen times he yanked the page out 
of the voicewriter. He was still in 
his mood when the reception screen 
showed that he had a visitor. It 
was Mark Olafson, but the name 
he gave now was Ross Buckley and 
his appearance was that of a suc- 
cessful businessman. 

Oren looked his surprise. 

“Well,” he said. “Made a go of 
it, have you?” 

“You might say so.” Mark re- 
plied. “In a manner of speaking.” 

27 




“I saw you go by our place yes- 
terday, but I had no idea you’d had 
such a complete change of fortune. 
Why didn’t you come in? Or is that 
a stupid question? I’m not much of 
a conspirator.” 

“You’re not a conspirator at all, 
I’m afraid,” Mark said. He lifted a 
flap in Oren’s desk and pressed the 
button that wiped the conversation 
tape. “You’ll pardon me. No, 
Donnie, you’re just a victim of an 
evil, stupid government. I saw that 
little drama in the garden yester- 
day, and I know more about you 
and Edith than you might suppose 
— never mind how. I’ve been busy 
since you and I last talked. In sev- 
eral ways. And I know that things 
have changed with you.” 

“They have, Mar — Buckley. 

They certainly have.” 

“Good lad. Thanks for the ‘Buck- 
ley.’ We’ll make a conspirator of 
you yet.” 

“They’re driving me into it,” 
Oren said. “Or out of the City- 
State, at any rate. Edith is already 
half-way thinking about that Jerry 
Hilarious thing as being a good idea 
— that ‘g’wan outside’ business. I 
guess you’ve been here long enough 
now to know about Jerry Hilari- 
ous.” 

“Yes,” said Mark. “Fve become 
very well acclimated. You know, 
Donnie, once I told you I didn’t 
think you’d like it out there. Now 
I’m not so sure. It hasn’t changed 
any Outside, except insofar as it’s 
always changing — for the better, 
we think — but . .” 

“I know,” Oren said. “I’ve 
changed. I’m waking up.” 

Mark Olafson looked at the 

28 



other man intently. “I shouldn’t 
do this,” he said. “It’s not my 
primary job, directly. But if you 
like, I’ll help you go.” 

“Oh?” Oren chewed his lip for 
a while. “I’d like to think about it, 
and talk to Edith. Could we make 
a living? We’re not farmers or 
laborers, you know. And — could we 
take it?” 

“Yes, to both. I suppose you’ve 
been saturated with the propagan- 
da films about Outside. I’ll not tell 
you they’re fakes, because they’re 
not exactly. They’re factual as far 
as they go. But they only go as far 
with their cameras and spies as we 
let them go.” 

“Oh?” Oren said again. “You 
mean there’s more than — ” 

“Lots more. I think I can safely 
say — to you — that you’d be pleas- 
antly surprised. Some of our people 
are farmers, of course, and some 
work in factories. But we have a 
thing called a Constitution, pretty 
much the same as the one a bunch 
of the boys hammered out back in 
the seventeen hundreds. It says 
things, for instance, about freedom 
of the press, and that means books, 
and books means somebody has to 
publish them.” 

“Books?” said Oren. 

“Of course. Your business. Ours 
don’t talk, yet. You still have to 
turn the pages and know how to 
read. But it’s something you could 
do if you didn’t mind going into 
the print shop once in a while and 
getting your hands inky.” 

“Printer’s ink,” said Oren, “How 
I used to love that smell! But how 
about Edith’s music?” 

“We’re not barbarians, except 

RICHARD WILSON 




maybe when the City-State turns its 
cameras on us. We have music, 
too.” 

“Well.” Oren’s eyes had a far-off 
look in them. 

“Well?” Mark echoed the word, 
smiling. 

“I don’t know what to say. I’m 
tempted, very much, to pack right 
up and move out there, but I don’t 
know. This is my country, even if 
it’s wrong in a lot of ways, and 
maybe I should stay and try to help 
make it right instead of deserting 
it.” 

“That’s a noble thought. I don’t 
mean that flippantly,” Mark added 
quickly. “I respect you for it. But 
can the few people like you who are 
left still do anything — from In- 
side?” 

“I don’t know,” Oren said. “I’ll 
have to think about it.” 

“I’ll be around,” Mark said. 
“Now that I’m respectable, or al- 
most, I’ll be keeping in touch with 
you.” 

“Good. What are you doing here 
— as Ross Buckley, I mean?” 

“Officially — at least as far as the 
City-State is concerned — I’m in the 
talking book business. Just like you. 
That’s why it’ll be easy for me to 
see you often, after I’ve really got 
started. Unofficially — you might say 
I’m in the business of counter- 
propaganda, or recruiting.” 

Oren realized that he’d be of no 
use in the office the rest of the day, 
either, and decided to go home and 
talk to Edith. 

“You’d better let me go ahead, 
by about five minutes,” Mark said. 
“I don’t think we should be seen 
together in public until things have 

ITS COLD OUTSIDE 



firmed up just a bit more.” 

Oren never saw him again. 
When he reached the street he 
found a crowd of people watching 
the departure of a Council Guard 
van. He asked the doorman what 
had happened. 

“They got an Outsider. He puts 
up a struggle but they beats him 
over the head and takes him off.” 
With his stomach squeezed tight 
Oren asked, “where did he come 
from?” 

“Somewheres in the building. 
Just by luck the same elevator 
jockey brings him down as takes 
him up and remembers the floor he 
comes from. The guards are up 
there now. They got the whole 
thirty-sixth floor sealed off and 
every last soul up there is getting 
their heads grilled off.” 

Mark Olafson must have walked 
three flights before and after his 
visit. Oren’s office was on the thirty- 
ninth floor. 



M ARK’S ARREST brought new 
tension into the Donn home. 
Oren knew Mark would never 
mention his name but he was 
frightened by the efficiency of the 
Council Guard in tracking down 
the Outsider despite his elaborate 
precautions. Apparently no one but 
the mechanical reception screen 
had seen Mark visit his office and 
fortunately it was not one that kept 
a permanent record. But presum- 
ably they knew where Mark Olaf- 
son lived and the clothes Oren had 
brought for him might be traced, if 
Mark had kept them. 

Although Oren tried to keep his 

29 




new worry from Edith, she finally 
forced it from him. But with it 
went the picture of Outside as 
Mark had described it for him and 
that, at least, was a consolation. 
The couple talked more and more 
seriously about making the break 
with their once-comfortable life 
and fleeing to the wilderness that 
now seemed more a promise of 
paradise. 

But where once they could have 
made the emigration with no dif- 
ficulty other than the scorn of their 
friends and the sneers of a govern- 
ment which would have confiscated 
their funds as it stamped their visas, 
they now were trapped in a land 
they had come to loathe. As a man 
under surveillance, Oren had only 
limited freedom. They’d already 
taken his gyro and he was sure that 
if he strayed far from the route be- 
tween his home and office he’d soon 
be tapped on the shoulder by a 
Council Guard. 

In this atmosphere Edith’s music 
stagnated. It was an academic 
question now whether the fact that 
she was naturally pregnant meant 
that she could not write a great 
symphony. She knew she could not 
write a bar now if she was a six- 
teenth generation obby baby whose 
female ancestors for three hundred 
years had been born in bowls of 
laboratory mush. 

Then, in the fifth month of her 
pregnancy, the Health Department 
specialists came back for the re- 
examination. All the exhaustive 
tests again were made but still there 
was none among them who could 
say with any certainty if Edith’s 
child would be normal after birth. 



Preventive paralysis was a tricky 
thing. That was about all they 
could state positively, and there 
had been only a few cases of an 
expectant mother having been pre- 
pared. 

The specialists went into a con- 
ference and emerged with a Rec- 
ommendation which they sent to 
the City-State Council. The Coun- 
cil deliberated and issued a Sugges- 
tion to Mr. and Mrs. Oren Donn. 

A Suggestion to a person under 
surveillance had the power of a 
Resolution and, of course, a Resolu- 
tion was an Edict, backed by what- 
ever force was needed to carry it 
out 

The Suggestion was that the 
mother should enter a Health De- 
partment hospital at the beginning 
of her ninth month and be subject 
to exhaustive tests under rigidly- 
controlled conditions. Then, if it 
was indicated that the birth would 
be normal — if something so old- 
fashioned as a natural birth could 
be considered “normal” — a film 
record would be made of the birth 
and of the infant’s progress. 

It would of course be necessary 
to have a complete record until 
such time as the child was found to 
be either normal or abnormal and 
therefore it was Suggested that the 
child would become a ward of the 
City-State while doubt remained. 
The mother would be free to re- 
turn home after the birth. 

That was when Oren and Edith 
decided they’d had it. They read 
the copy of the Suggestion which 
had been brought to them for their 
signatures. They signed it, received 
the thanks of the medical officer for 



30

their intelligent cooperation, and 
then made their plans. 

There was to be, on the Restday 
after next, the annual Rededication 
Jubilee in State Square, a vast pub- 
lic amphitheater. It was the one 
day in the year when the Members 
of the Council made a public ap- 
pearance and of course everyone 
went to pay his respects and add to 
the din of applause and cheers 
when the Members made their brief 
speeches. It was also the day a- 
wards were made in the form of 
medals and scrolls to citizens who 
had done most for the City-State 
during the preceding year. Mostly 
the recipients were officials of the 
government, but they never were 
the Council Members themselves, 
who year after year modestly re- 
fused their nomination by the 
awards committee. 

This alone should have been 
enough to guarantee attendance, 
but there was always entertainment 
besides. The greatest names in the 
movies and triveo appeared, each 
with a special new act never before 
seen anywhere. The star of stars 
this year was to be Jerry Hilarious, 
that sensational new triveo comic. 

There was no triveo of the Jubi- 
lee, however. It was thoroughly un- 
derstood that it would be unpatri- 
otic not to be one of the crowd 
personally taking part in the Oath 
of Rededication that climaxed the 
occasion. Therefore there would be 
no one at home to see a triveo cast 
of it. Films were made, though, for 
showing at a later date to those 
who had to work on the holiday 
and those in institutions. 

Jubilee Day dawned hot and 

ITS COLD OUTSIDE 



sunny. Oren and Ethel knew that 
their best chance would come when 
the ceremonies ended and the mobs 
of people swarmed in all directions 
for home. They and little Marty in 
his baby buggy would be part of 
that anonymous crowd and they 
would let that part of it which 
swarmed west take them with it — 
toward the setting sun, and Out- 
side. Just exactly how they would 
escape notice when they reached the 
outskirts of the City-State, or how 
they would cross the boundary, they 
did not know. But if there was a 
way they would find it. 

It was a long day. They’d taken 
nothing with them except some 
changes of clothing for the baby, 
and only as much money as they 
would normally be expected to 
carry with them, and Edith’s music 
— the manuscript of the first three 
movements of her symphony. But 
though they were traveling light 
they had the weight of fear with 
them until they had worked them- 
selves well into the center of the 
crowd in the great square. They 
found seats. 

Under the broiling sun — the heat 
only slightly mitigated by the frig- 
eration towers — the program be- 
gan. The vast audience was restless 
despite the brevity of the official 
speeches but when each ended the 
applause was deafening. Oren and 
Edith applauded, too, looking cau- 
tiously around to see if any guards 
were watching. None was in sight 
anywhere near them. 

Jerry Hilarious romped onto the 
stage and was welcomed with a 
roar of laughter. At first the Donns 
forced themselves to laugh at his 

31 




antics, not to seem out of place, 
and as they watched they realized 
that the short, wiry redhead was 
genuinely an artist and not just a 
buffoon. 

He was giving a masterful per- 
formance and through his special 
material could be seen the man, 
warm-hearted, inventive, instantly 
responsive to the mood of the 
crowd. Oren and Edith relaxed and 
felt their tension ease off. They 
gained strength through the respite 
for the journey ahead. Only when 
Jerry Hilarious wound himself up 
and threw his familiar catch line at 
the crowd did Edith fail to laugh. 

“Aw,” boomed the words, “g’wan 
outside !” 

“Amen,” said Edith under her 
breath. 

Finally, after repeated encores, 
Jerry Hilarious left the stage. Act 
after act followed and at last, in 
late afternoon, the program ended 
with the solemn Oath of Rededica- 
tion. The Donns mouthed the 
promissory, meaningless words, 
stood up froiri the folding chairs 
for the recessional music and then 
joined a throng that was heading 
west. 

The crush was so great that Oren 
took Marty up and carried him 
while Edith collapsed the baby 
buggy to briefcase size and carried 
it. They found a kiosk and, sur- 
rounded by humanity, made their 
way down to the westbound mov- 
ing pavement. Clinging together so 
as not to lose each other, they were 
propelled along at a steady fifteen 
miles an hour. 

The pavement and the throng 
took them under the Hudson River 

32 



and into what had once been New 
Jersey but which now was just an- 
other part of Greater New York. 
The crowd had begun to thin as the 
pavement branched north and 
south but there were still many 
thousands of people heading west. 
Marty was asleep with his head on 
his father’s shoulder and Oren’s 
arms were beginning to ache. Edith 
had a pain in the back of the neck, 
as if someone were staring at her 
there and any moment would tap 
her on the shoulder and say “Go 
back.” 

Miles later the moving pavement 
ended, at the top of a rise. Nearby 
was a loading platform for buses. 
Neither of them knew where they 
were or in which direction to go 
next. 

A dilapidated old gasoline bus 
that still carried the lettering Penn- 
sylvania Greyhound was marked 
Borderville and they boarded that 
one. 

They were exhausted when the 
bus reached its terminal. It had 
been crowded when it started off. 
The Donns had found seats but 
many others stood. At the end of 
the line, however, less than two 
dozen persons still were aboard. 

Wearily the Donns got up. When 
they left the bus it drove off. Their 
fellow riders melted away into the 
dusk and the Donns walked at ran- 
dom down a street of ancient houses 
and old-fashioned stores with full 
plate-glass windows. They tried to 
look as if they had a destination. 

Several blocks later they saw a 
sign in red neon tubing which once 
had spelled HOTEL. They would 
have to go in. They could do noth- 

RICHARD WILSON 




ing more tonight. 

In the dimly lit lobby, an old 
man sat in a heavy armchair be- 
hind the counter, dozing. There 
was no one else. 

Oren cleared his throat and the 
man opened his eyes. 

“Hi, there,” he said. “Customers, 
eh? Always get a customer or two 
on Jubilee Day. How was the 
show?” 

“Great,” said Oren without en- 
thusiasm. “Could we have a double 
room, please, with an extra cot for 
the baby? I don’t suppose you have 
a crib.” 

“Sure do,” the old man said. 
“We ain’t so antiquated as you 
might think, though we are a mite 
far off from the center of things. 
Like a room with a bath, or would 
down the hall do you? Five credits 
cheaper for down the hall.” 

“With bath, please,” Oren 
smiled. He couldn’t remember that 
he’d ever had to make the choice 
before. 

“Right you are, sir. Sir,” he re- 
peated. “Sometimes forget to say 
that.” He cackled. “You from Out- 
side? Or maybe goin’ there? I know 
you ain’t from around here.” 

Edith looked at Oren with weary, 
frightened eyes and Marty whim- 
pered sleepily as Oren shifted him 
to the other shoulder. * 

The old man cackled again. 
“That’s all right,” he said. “You 
don’t have to say nothin’. Lots of 
Outsiders sneak across on Jubilee 
Day. And vicey versa. Nobody pays 
much mind. I certainly ain’t goin’ 
to make a fuss about it. All I care 
about’s you pay me twenty credits 
in advance, seein’ as you got no 



luggage.” 

Oren fished out his wallet and 
handed it to Edith, who counted 
out twenty credits to the old man, 
who put them in his pocket and 
took a key out of a cubbyhole. 

“Second floor,” he said. “Eleva- 
tor got cranky couple years ago and 
it ain’t worked since. Hope you 
don’t mind the stairs.” 

The stairs creaked loudly as they 
climbed them. Their room was just 
off the stair well and there was a 
film of dust on the battered chest 
of drawers. When Edith took the 
spread off the big double bed, 
though, she found fresh linen un- 
derneath. Oren put the baby down 
with a grunt of relief. 

“I’ll bring the crib up in a little 
while,” the old man said. “Any- 
thing else you’d like?” He was dubi- 
ous when Oren asked about the 
possibility of having a meal sent up 
to the room but finally agreed to 
see what he could do. Maybe the 
place down the street, if they 
weren’t too busy. He went out. 

The food came sooner than they 
had dared hope. It was hot and 
good, although they had to eat off 
a rickety card table the old man 
brought up with the crib. 

They ate the meal, fed the baby 
and put him to bed and then, while 
Edith ran herself a hot bath, Oren 
went down to the lobby to buy 
cigarets. 

The stairs creaked under his feet 
but the sound was drowned out by 
a crash as the street door was 
thrown open and a crowd of people 
entered in a babble of loud talk. 
There were about a dozen of them. 
Two of them were women and all 

33 



ITS COLD OUTSIDE 




of them seemed to be drunk. All 
were well dressed. 

Oren froze on the landing, half in 
the shadow. He dared not go back 
up for fear of attracting attention 
to himself, so he stood and watched. 

One man, apparently the leader 
of the noisy group, went to the 
counter and pounded on it. 

“Innkeeper!” he commanded. 
He took off his hat and sailed it 
neatly onto the branch of a coat- 
tree across the room. The gesture 
revealed a flaming shock of red 
hair. There was no doubt of his 
identity. 

Jerry Hilarious. 

Oren drew himself farther back 
into the corner of the landing. 

The old man came around a cor- 
ner of the lobby. 

“There you are/’ said Jerry 
Hilarious. “Throw open the bar 
for these good people, Innkeeper. 
They’re beginning to run down.” 

“Ain’t got no bar, strictly speak- 
in’,” the old man said. 

“I have hung up my hat and I 
intend to stay,” the red-haired man 
said. “You have tables in the lobby. 
These will do. Put liquor on them. 
Or would you rather” — he wound 
up and let fly his gesture of ban- 
ishment at the old man — “g’wan 
outside !” 

One of the other men in the 
group slapped a third on the back 
and howled: 

“That Jerry Hilarious — he kills 
me!” 

The old man spat calmly into a 
flaked enamel cuspidor. “Don’t 
kill me,” he said. “If you got money 
I guess I can rustle up some bar 
whisky from someplace. We get all 

34 



kinds here. You come from the 
Jubilee, I take it?” 

A florid-faced man in a check- 
ered tunic pushed importantly for- 
ward and slapped some credits on 
the counter. “Take it!” he cried, 
laughing drunkenly. “We brought 
the Jubilee with us — hah, Jerry?” 
“I have brought this roistering 
company,” Jerry Hilarious said, 
“to see the outside of the Outside. 
But if you don’t hurry they’ll start 
to unroister, which is a dishearten- 
ing sight. So hasten with the liq- 
uor, Innkeeper.” 

The comedian ended his little 
speech with a crazy dance that 
evoked more laughter. The old man 
brought bottles and glasses from 
under the counter and set them out 
on the tables. One of the women 
hiccupped in a moment of silence 
and leaned against her escort for 
support. 

“Music!” cried Jerry Hilarious. 
“Turn on the triveo!” 

“Trivia!” shouted the man in 
the checkered tunic. “Turn on the 
trivia!” 

“Sir,” said Jerry Hilarious, pir- 
ouetting and jabbing a finger into 
one >of the checks, “you slander 
my profession. G’wan outside!” 
“G’wan outside! G’wan out- 
side!” the others echoed, laughing, 
and the company was roistering 
again. 

“Ain’t got no triveo,” the old 
man said without apology. “Got 
an old video, though.” He switched 
it on. 

“I don’t think this is a very good 
party,” said the woman who had 
hiccupped. “I’m depressed.” 
“Can’t expect all the conven- 

RICHARD WILSON 




iences, dear, when you get so far 
from civilization,” her escort said. 
“Can you, Jerry?” 
“Extemporaneous reply,” Jerry 
Hilarious said. He sang: 

You’d feel worse in a hearse — 
You’d be drab on a slab. 

That is the curse 
Of being inside the Outside. 

He went into one of his fantastic 
dances as music blasted out of the 
video. 

Oren took advantage of the di- 
version to slip back upstairs and 
into their room. 

Edith came out of the bathroom 
with a towel wrapped around her. 

“What’s all that noise, Oren?” 
she asked. “It worried me.” 

“It’s Jerry Hilarious, of all 
people. He’s got a crowd with him 
on the tail end of some private 
Jubilee.” 

“Jerry Hilarious!” she said. “Did 
they see you?” 

“I don’t think so.” 

“Why did they come all the way 
out here?” she asked. 

“Educational tour, apparently. 
Slumming to see how it is in bor- 
derland so they can congratulate 
themselves on living where they 
do. We can’t leave. About all we 
can do is try to get some sleep and 
see what happens in the morning. I 
don’t think they’ll make a night of 
it. A couple of them are pretty 
bored already.” 

But an hour later, as they were 
dozing off, they heard the stairs 
creak. 

It wasn’t the tired tread of the 
old man. Someone was taking the 
steps two at a time. They listened 
in alarm to the footsteps, then in 

ITS COLD OUTSIDE 



dread as they stopped just outside 
their door. There was a knock, a 
brisk tattoo. 

They dressed quickly. Oren 
opened the door. 

Jerry Hilarious stood there. 

Oren’s heart sank. Edith came 
to his side. 

“Oh,” she said. She took Oren’s 
hand. 

“Hello,” Jerry Hilarious said. 
He was smiling. “May I come in? 
I could only get away for a min- 
ute.” 

“So you found us,” Oren said in 
despair. He opened the door wider, 
then closed it behind the come- 
dian. 

“And we were laughing at you — 
with you, really — just this after- 
noon,” Edith said. “I know you 
have to work for them that way, 
but I didn’t think you were their 
bloodhound, too.” 

“No, no,” said Jerry Hilarious. 
“I’ve never hunted anything, ex- 
cept laughs. I’m sorry if I fright- 
ened you. I’m on your side, the way 
Mark Olafson was.” 

“You know Mark?” Oren asked. 

“I knew him. He’s dead. They 
beat him to death. They’d beat me 
to death, too, if they found out 
about me.” 

“Then you’re an Outsider, too?” 
Oren asked. Relief swept through 
him. 

Edith grasped the comedian’s 
hand. “Mr. Hilarious,” she said. 
“Oh, I could cry.” 

“Call me Jerry. That’s my real 
name. The Hilarious is strictly for 
laughs.” 

“Poor Mark,” Oren said. “It was

What are the chances of Man finding intelligent life on other 



planets? Here is the answer by a world ranking aero physicist! 



THIS 

Lonely Earth 



BY DR. WALTHER RIEDEL 



I N THE incredibly long, yet so 
pitifully brief span of those few 
million years since Man began fit- 
fully to acquire the ability to ob- 
serve, contemplate, and deduce, he 
has become more and more self- 
conscious of his lone position in 
the midst of all other creatures. 
The first domestication of wild an- 
imals may have arisen as an answer 
to his psychological desire to find at 
least semi-intelligent creatures 
among other branches of the ani- 
mal kingdom, just as much as 
through his physical need for a 
plentiful food supply which was not 



dependent on the vagaries of the 
hunt and chase. From this same 
psychological root may stem our 
present interest in all the animated 
world; our eager striving to un- 
ravel the mystery of the homing 
sense of migrating birds, or that of 
the world of social insects which 
solved complicated political and 
sociological problems several hun- 
dred million years ago, as well as 
our simple love of the pooch in 
the parlor. Our evolution, from 
animal-like acceptance of our sur- 
roundings, to searching contempla- 
tion may have left entangled in our 



36 




personality the deeply rooted vision 
of the Garden of Eden as a reflex of 
that long gone dawn age when pre- 
Man vigorously lived out his short 
life in ignorance, and often in ter- 
ror, but as yet uncursed with the 
concept of loneliness. 

This perpetual loneliness of man- 
kind, in the midst of teeming life, 
results in mythological contempla- 
tion, in religious endeavor, and in 
philosophical and scientific study. 
Modern science fiction often pre- 
supposes that extraterrestrial cul- 
tures and civilizations do exist 
in time coincident with ours, and 
that their locations in space will be 
within range of our future tech- 
nology in travel and communi- 
cations. 

This concept implicitly embodies 
three conditions which must be 
fulfilled if human space expeditions 
are to have any chance ever to en- 
counter Extraterrestrial intelli- 
gence. We believe that today we 
are able to judge these three ques- 
tions with sufficient reliability to 
secure answers which are likely to 
be close to reality. Starting with 
those beyond our own control, we 
have to judge: 

1. a. Chances for the existence of 

intelligent life in the Uni- 
verse in our Galaxy, in 
our planetary system. 

2. Odds on the timely coinci- 
dence of outside intelli- 
gent cultures within the 
limited span of existence 
of our own species, Homo 
Sapiens. 



EDITOR'S NOTE 

Dr. Walther Riedel is per- 
haps best known for his work 
on rockets during the second 
World War. Following a 
series of important posts 
during his earlier career, in 
1940 he became attached to 
the Rocket Research and 
Development Station at Peen- 
emuende, becoming a key 
figure in the advancement of 
German rocketry. At this sta- 
tion he was Scientific Co- 
ordinator between the Tech- 
nical University and Peen- 
emuende for two years, then 
Chief Designer for one year; 
from 1943-45 he was Director 
of Development and Design 
and vice-Director of Peen- 
emuende Station, heading up 
some 4500 technical person- 
nel. From 1944-45 he was 
Governmental Co-ordinator 
for all German rocket pro- 
pulsion systems development 
and production. 

Following the war, he 
came to America and for 
ten years was engaged in 
the advanced development 
of American rockets and 
guided missiles. 

Dr. Riedel’s article is a 
scholarly approach to the 
question of whether or not 
we will find intelligent life 
in outer space and gives us a 
startling concept of time, 
space and Man.

3. Possible future range of 
human space expeditions. 

The elapsed span of some four 
million years since our ape-like 
oldest ancestors acquired the right 
to be called forerunners of modern 
man, can be divided into five 
periods of rapidly diminishing 
length: 

1. Several millions of years spent 
in animal-like acceptance of 
nature. 

2. One million years of mytho- 
logical explanation for na- 
ture’s demonstrations. 

3. Several thousand years of re- 
ligious world concept. 

4. A few thousand years of 
philosophical approach. 

5. A few hundred years of exact 
Science. 

Rudiments of these five epochs 
are mixed within modem man to 
varying degrees, and this individual 
composition in each of us is a part 
of our “world picture”. This 
alloy of so many diverging in- 
fluences gives us the strength, 
usually, to withstand the daily im- 
pact of quarreling impressions — 
and gives us, now and again, the 
very common mental headache 
against which no remedial aspirin 
has been found, beyond a few in- 
famous narcotics. Perhaps, out of 
this pot-pourri of thinking systems, 
arises also our gift of simultane- 
ously considering the thought of 
Man as the “crown of creation” to- 
gether with the reluctantly forgiven 
egotism implicit in such a notion. 

38 



Intelligent life in this universe and 
within “our” galaxy ? 

Strange as it may seem, this 
question is simply answered. We 
shall have to think, for the moment, 
in well established large, even 
gigantic figures. Because of their 
enormous size, we will here give 
them in powers of ten*. 

*(that is, 10 21 is the short way 
of writing 1 followed by 21 
zeroes. Similarly, 10 6 is the same 
as 1 followed by six zeroes, or 
one million. Readers interested 
in calculating the above figures 
in terms of millions, billions, and 
trillions, etc., may simply add 
the number of zeroes, indicated 
by the raised ‘power’ numeral 
immediately following each 10, 
to the numeral 1.) 

Modern scientific thinking has 
evolved a draft of the dimen- 
sions and content of our Uni- 
verse which may be described in 
the following terms: In a volume 
of space 6 x 10 9 light years in di- 
ameter* are distributed 10 55 grams 
of matter. 

*(one light year is a figure close 
to 5,865,696,000,000 miles; i.e., 
the distance a beam of light 
travels in one year at the con- 
stant rate of approximately 186,- 
000 miles per second.) 

About half of this total weight of 
existing matter is embodied in the 
form of stars, or suns, the total ex- 
isting number of which we may 
estimate to be approximately 10 22 . 
These suns are organized in large, 
separate groups, which we call gal- 
axies, and which may be estimated 
to be roughly 10 10 in number. 

DR. WALTHER RIEDEL 




Therefore, the average number of 
suns contained in an average 
galaxy is about 10 12 . If we assume 
that, among each million suns, only 
one is gifted with one planet upon 
whose surface exist conditions suit- 
able to the maintainance of life 
(as we can presently define it), 
then it follows that in this Universe 
there are 10 22 -divided-by-10 6 , or 
10 1C suns encircled by at least one 
planet which is capable of develop- 
ing and supporting intelligent life. 
Just for impact, this last sentence 
means there are 10,000,000,000,- 
000,000 such suns, with such planets 
capable of life, in existence 
throughout our Universe, right this 
moment. 

This stupendous number of 
planets in the Universe which dis- 
play Earth-like conditions demands 
we answer a clear ‘‘yes 55 to the 
question of whether intelligent life 
exists in the Universe, and “yes” 
again, even when we narrow our 
field of consideration down to the 
single, more or less average, galaxy 
in which our own sun is a very un- 
important member among trillions 
of others. The above figures show 
that, in our own galaxy alone — 
just in our own Milky Way — there 
are 10 12 -divided-by-10 6 , or ap- 
proximately one million suns which 
are likely to have planets which re- 
semble Mother Earth with regard 
to conditions for life. Even if Na- 
ture should have only 1% success 
in developing intelligent life where 
conditions are favorable, we would 
still have to expect a minimum of a 
thousand planets gifted with intel- 
ligent life here in our own galaxy. 

Conclusion: The existence of in- 



telligent life within the Universe, 
and within our own Milky Way 
galaxy is beyond doubt. 

Intelligent life in our planetary 
system? 

Within our Solar System, the cli- 
mates of the four inner planets are 
fairly well known; i.e., Mercury, 
Venus, Earth, and Mars. Mars 
would appear to be the most feas- 
ible object for close study by human 
space expeditions, after they have 
reached our neighbor Moon. In 
comparing its climatological con- 
ditions with those of Earth, many 
experts may be found leaning over 
backwards to call them “unlive- 
able”. We should not underesti- 
mate the tenacity with which life 
can adjust itself to an enormous 
span of physical and chemical con- 
ditions. Man has populated the 
Earth from the Arctic Ice Gap to 
the sizzling heat of parched deserts 
and the soggy drip of brooding 
jungles, from sea level to the majes- 
tic peaks of the Andes. Lowering 
temperatures, rarification of the at- 
mosphere, and depreciation of 
chemical resources can be mas- 
tered by capable civilizations to an 
amazing degree, as our still infini- 
tesimal history already shows. The 
slow increase in the importance of 
problems seems to produce solu- 
tions to solve them. For instance, 
the decrease of easily available 
fuels, here on Earth, would event- 
ually have resulted in the detection 
of nuclear energy sources, even if 
the Second World War had not 
brought about peaceful applica- 



THIS LONELY EARTH 



39 




tions of atomic energy almost as a 
by-product. Therefore, such ad- 
jectives as “unliveable”, when ap- 
plied to a planet such as Mars, do 
not properly take into account the 
ability of life to adapt itself to 
changing conditions, particularly 
to those slow changes which are the 
result of the normal aging of a 
planet the size of Mars. Such aging, 
in the case of Mars, has been vastly 
more rapid than that of the larger 
Earth, as shown in the accompany- 
ing illustrations; but to our human 
senses, during the whole span of 
the existence of human life on 
Earth, it would have been almost 
imperceptible. 



T HE accompanying graphical 
illustration shows temper- 
ature plotted against the passage of 
time for both Earth and Mars. 
The dense canopy of primeval 
clouds, surrounding both hot 
planets, began to condense to heavy 
rainstorms after temperatures be- 
low 212°F. were reached — very 
early on Mars (after 1000 years) 
and only 3000 to 4000 years later 
on Earth. Early forms of primitive 
life may have evolved shortly after 
the water temperature passed be- 
low 160°F. — less than one million 
years after “zero time” on Mars, 
nearly a hundred million years later 
on Earth. At an age of ten to 
fifteen million years, the average 
temperature on Mars must have 
been close to that of the Earth 
when it reached an age of four bil- 
lion years. 

If we assume that organic life de- 
veloped on Earth after the average 

40 



surface temperature sank below 
the coagulation point of proto- 
plasm, some one hundred million 
years after the birth of the Earth, 
the gigantic span of three thousand 
million years elapsed before there 
developed species whose residual 
remains were enduring enough to 
leave evidence of their existence 
scattered through the jumble of 
the upper strata of the Earth’s crust 
in the form of fossils. Only a few 
million years after the emergence 
of the first insects, ants, termites 
and bees had already reached an 
astonishing perfection. In the 
Eocene, the early Tertiary period, 
termites had already evolved winged 
versions to undertake the task of 
spreading the species by means of 
the deadly honeymoon flight. In 
the Oligocene, the existence of 
sterile ‘workers’ has been estab- 
lished. 

With regard to such ancient 
“archaic” inhabitants of Earth, 
Man, as such, is a very young new- 
comer. My graph shows Man at 
the right-hand end of the time axis, 
some four billion years since a 
droplet of molten matter started its 
trajectory around Mother Sun to 
eventually become the Earth upon 
which we live. If we could spread 
the graph in such a way that the 
time axis would be as long as our 
distance around the equator of the 
Earth, then a distance on it of 
ten kilometers (6.214 miles) would 
correspond to one million years. 
Therefore, only 40 kilometers, a 
tiny segment of this circumference, 
represent the time since a simian- 
like type of animal learned to walk 
erectly. In freeing its two front feet 

DR. WALTHER RIEDEL 




TIME, MILUONS OF YEARS x IOO 





from the task of walking, it de- 
veloped that most agile natural 
tool, the hand. The span of history 
from the far-off day of that most 
ancient primitive root from which 
the race of modern man has 
sprung, to the modern day in which 
we live, is thus seen to cover only 
a tiny 1/1000 of the total history 
of the planet Earth. And only with- 
in the last 200,000 years has a more 
advanced type started to spread 
over the planet’s face ... a type for 
which we have coined the name 
“Homo Sapiens”. These 200,000 
years correspond, on our expanded 
graph, to a distance of only 2 kilo- 
meters, out of roughly 40,000 for 
the total history of the planet. On 
the graph as it is printed, these 200,- 
000 years would be represented by 
a dot less than 1/ 1000" of an inch 
in width, which is far too small to 
be visible to the naked eye. The di- 
ameter of the dot for “Man”, as 
you see it, represents thirty million 
years, or one hundred and fifty 
times the actual life span of the 
human species on this Earth. Who 
dares to say that Homo Sapiens 
will still exist when the steadily 
creeping time will have covered the 
full diameter of this little dot on 
the right-hand comer of the graph? 



Y OU MAY consider these big 
numbers futile! Yet they estab- 
lish that the time for intelligent life 
on our own, or other planets is 
extremely short; so short that any 
timely coincidence of intelligent 
life on two or more planets within 
our small planetary system is 
highly improbable. 

42 



By the same logic, it is possible 
that, at this very time, intelligent 
life does exist elsewhere in the 
Universe. To clarify this apparent 
contradiction, notice that the graph 
illustrates the results of calculations 
of the temperature of identical age, 
as that temperature is influenced 
by their size only. The two circles 
illustrate the relative sizes of Earth 
and Mars which, for rough consid- 
eration, have diameters in the ratio 
of 2/1. Therefore, by the familiar 
calculations, Earth possesses 4 
times the surface area of Mars, and 
8 times its volume. These propor- 
tions indicate about twice the vol- 
ume of matter per unit of surface 
for Earth in comparison to Mars. 
More exact figures in the graph 
show that one square mile of Earth 
surface must radiate the heat stem- 
ming from 1320 cubic miles of 
earthen matter, while one square 
mile of Martian surface radiates the 
heat content of only 703 cubic miles 
of matter. Neglecting the influence 
of the different distances of both 
planets from the Sun, and assum- 
ing that heat-capacity, radiancy and 
nuclear processes are similar in both 
bodies, the resulting temperature- 
versus-time curves have been cal- 
culated. In the beginning, with 
both planets at a temperature of 
around 3600° Fahrenheit, the cool- 
ing rate of Earth must have been 
on the order of 8.6°F. per year, and 
that of Mars about four times as 
high, 34.5°F. per year. Since the 
possible date for the beginning of 
protoplasmic life on Earth down 
to our present day, nearly four bil- 
lion years have passed, resulting in 
an average-temperature drop to 

DR. WALTHER RIEDEL 




100°F. on Earth, and to 50°F. for 
Mars. Even if Martian life succeed- 
ed in speeding up its development 
under the pressure of decreasing 
temperature and dissipating atmos- 
phere, it must be very much 
doubted that this rapid develop- 
ment lead to intelligent beings 
which have managed to survive 
the enormously long time gap be- 
tween the age of their first ap- 
pearance and ours. 

The statement that Mars is an 
“old” planet becomes, in the light 
of these considerations, erroneous. 
Mars is a planet which is of the 
same geological age as the Earth, 
yet which possesses, due to the na- 
ture of its geometry, a higher cool- 
ing rate. 

Mars seems to us to be fairly un- 
favorable to life because of its low 
mean temperature (-30 to-40°F.), 
low density of atmosphere (surface 
atmospheric pressure on Mars 
equals that of the Earth at an alti- 
tude of eleven miles), rarity of 
gaseous oxygen (0 2 content of 
Mars’ atmosphere seems to be 1% 
to 1/10% that of Earth), and 60 
m.p.h. sandstorms roaring across 
its eroded surface. But there is no 
necessity that a Martian-bom in- 
telligence should feel the same way 
about his home climate as we do 
.now, from so far away, and as we 
still will when human expeditions 
first set foot on Martian soil. It is 
quite possible that intelligent beings 
have passed through millions of 
years of evolution on Mars since 
the establishment of life on that 
planet, but that they died out un- 
der the pressure of increasingly 
severe climatological conditions, 

THIS LONELY EARTH 



and have been gone for uncounted 
ages. 

The result of these conclusions 
is that the first expeditions which 
Man succeeds in throwing out to 
Mars will not, upon setting foot 
upon that barren planet, find traces 
of former civilization. Only after 
long and very detailed studies, and 
with equipment which will require 
several transits between Earth and 
Mars, might they possibly detect 
traces of former intelligent life, 
should such traces have survived 
accidentally or intentionally some 
two thousand million years of 
chemical and physical attack by 
the natural forces of their environ- 
ment. 

Not a single human product of 
today would be able to survive the 
ravages of such a tremendous length 
of time, in any form sufficient for 
some intelligent explorer of the far- 
off dim future to identify it as an 
artifact, or relic of our present 
civilization. The five thousand years 
since Cheops built his pyramid are 
not worth mentioning in this con- 
text. Even the twenty thousand 
years since the first crude Neolithic 
culture represent only 1/100,000 of 
that gigantic span by which Mar- 
tian culture may have preceded us. 

It would not be too surprising if, 
after centuries of careful studies on 
Mars, we may find that, if once 
there were Martians, they may 
have chosen to emigrate, rather 
than to die, to some other part of 
the Solar System and in doing so 
by-passed Earth because of her un- 
favorable climate for the Martian 
emigrant. 

The decades to come will increase 

43 




and refine our knowledge about 
the climates of the planets in our 
Solar System. And, since the escape 
velocity of a space-bound rocket 
ship is only 25,000 m.p.h., or 5 
times that of the two-stage Bumper 
fired several years ago (V 2 plus 
Wac Corporal), mankind will solve 
the problems of travel through 
space to the Moon, and then to 
Mars, within a short time. Yet the 
minimum energy route of 250 days 
for a one-way trip to Mars, or that 
to Venus, as she circles in her 
canopy of brilliant white clouds, or 
even that to the broiling Sunward 
face of Mercury, might be called 
still in the rubber band class, when 
compared to the task of spanning 
the tremendous distances between 
Earth and Jupiter and the other 
outer planets. Jupiter protects him- 
self by this great distance from 
us (the one-way trip would require 
two years and nine months with 
the same techniques sufficient to 
cover the Earth-Mars run) and 
by his formidable gravity, which 
would necessitate an escape velocity 
of 130,000 m.p.h., or more than 
five times that necessary to leave 
Earth. An unmeasurable period 
of technological development will 
therefore be necessary — as well as 
the development of propulsion 
methods completely unforeseeable 
today — before mankind will find it 
possible to touch even the inmost 
of the outer planets, or one of their 
many satellites. 

Light covers the distance from 
the Sun to Jupiter in four minutes 
and thirty seconds. Yet it must 



travel 4.2 years to reach our next- 
door-neighbor sun within the gal- 
axy. Only if it were possible for 
Man to span distances of many 
thousands of light-years in his 
explorations would a decent statis- 
tical chance evolve for him to en- 
counter extraterrestrial intelligent 
life. This fact must be taken at face 
value, in spite of the great number 
of suns, even in our own galaxy, 
with planets on which intelligent 
life will have existed and died, may 
be active now, or will evolve in 
future. 

With these conclusions in mind, 
we can now answer our basic 
questions. We can predict that 
within the entire range of Man- 
kind’s future existence as a living 
species of this Earth, any chance 
for his physical contact with in- 
telligent life outside this Solar 
planetary system is impossible, even 
though the chances for the existence 
of such remote-in-space, but con- 
gruent-in-time intelligent life are 
so high as to be beyond doubt. 
Whatever chances there are for 
Man to encounter intelligent life 
are limited to this planetary system 
which surrounds our own Sun ; 
and, for an extremely long period, 
to the inner planets alone. Unfor- 
tunately, the chances for the exist- 
ence of any intelligent life on the 
inner planets, within the time-span 
of Man, would appear to be on 
the order of nil. 

But when did Man ever cast the 
die of his future according to logic. 
He will go and look. • • •

It was a war of survival. Children against, old men. 



And not a chance in the world to bridge 

T H E 

chasm 

BY BRYCE WALTON 



T HE OLD man’s face was turn- 
ing gray with fatigue under the 
wrinkled brown. He was beginning 
to get that deadly catching pain in 
his left chest. But he forced him- 
self to move again, his ragged dusty 
uniform of the old Home Guard 
blending into the rubble the way a 
lizard merges with sand. 

He hobbled behind a pile of ma- 
sonry and peered through the crack. 
He angled his bald head, listening. 
His hands never really stopped 
quivering these days and the auto- 
matic rifle barrel made a fluttering 
crackle on the concrete. He lowered 
the barrel, then wiped his face with 



a bandanna. 

He’d thought he heard a creep- 
ing rustle over there. But he didn’t 
see any sign of the Children. 

He’d been picked to reconnoiter 
because his eyes were only compar- 
atively good. The truth was he 
couldn’t see too well, especially 
when the sun reflecting on the flat 
naked angles of the ruined town 
made his eyes smart and water and 
now his head was beginning to 
throb. 

A dust devil danced away whirl- 
ing a funnel of dust. Sal Lemmon 
looked at it, and then he slid from 
behind the rubble and moved along 



45 




down the shattered block, keeping 
to the wall of jagged holes and 
broken walls that had once been 
the Main Street of a town. 

He remembered with a wry ex- 
pression on his face that he had 
passed his ninety-fourth birthday 
eight days back. He had never 
thought he could be concerned 
with whether he lived to see his 
ninety-fifth, because there had al- 
ways been the feeling that by the 
time he was ninety-four he would 
have made his peace with himself 
and with whatever was outside. 

He moved warily, like a dusty 
rabbit, in and out of the ruins, 
shrinking through the sun’s dead 
noon glare. 

He stopped, and crouched in the 
shade behind a pile of slag that had 
once been the iron statue of some 
important historical figure. He con- 
tacted Captain Murphy on the 
walkie-talkie. 

“Don’t see any signs of Chil- 
dren.” 

“Max said he saw some around 
there,” Murphy yelled. 

“Max’s getting too old. Guess 
he’s seeing things.” 

“He saw them right around there 
somewhere.” 

“Haven’t seen him either.” 

“We haven’t heard another word 
from Max here, Sal.” 

The old man shrugged. “How 
could the Children have gotten 
through our post defenses?” He 
looked away down the white glare 
of the street. 

“You’re supposed to be finding 
out,” Murphy yelled. He had a 
good voice for a man two months 
short of being a hundred. He liked 

46 



to show it off. 

Then Sal thought he saw an odd 
fluttery movement down the block. 

“I’ll report in a few minutes,” he 
said, and then he edged along next 
to the angled wall. A disturbed 
stream of plaster whispered down 
and ran off his shoulder. 

Near the comer, he stopped. 
“Max,” he said. He whispered it 
several times. “Max . that you, 
Max?” 

He moved nearer to the blob on 
the concrete. Heat waves radiated 
up around it and it seemed to 
quiver and dance. He dropped the 
walkie-talkie. There wasn’t even 
enough left of Max to take back in 
or put under the ground. 

He heard the metallic clank and 
the manhole cover moved and then 
he saw them coming up over the 
edge. He ran and behind him he 
could hear their screams and cries 
and their feet striking hard over 
the blisters, cracks, and dried out 
holes in the dead town’s skin. 

He dodged into rubble and fell 
and got up and kept on running. 
The pain was like something 
squeezing in his belly, and he kept 
on running because he wanted to 
live and because he had to tell the 
others that the Children were in- 
deed inside the post defenses. 

He knew now how they had 
come in. Through the sewers, un- 
der the defenses. He began to feel 
and hear them crawling, digging, 
moving all over beneath the ruins, 
waiting to come out in a filthy 
screaming stream. 

Sal was still resting in the comer 
of the old warehouse by the river.

A lantern hung on a beam and the 
dank floor was covered with deep 
moving shadows. 

Captain Murphy was pacing in a 
circle, looking like something sewn 
quickly together by a nervous seam- 
stress. Doctor Cartley sat on a can- 
vas chair, elbows on knees, chin in 
his hands. He kept looking at the 
floor. He was in his early eighties 
and sometimes seemed like a young 
man to Sal. His ideas maybe. He 
thought differently about the Chil- 
dren and where things were going. 

“We’re going to get out tonight,” 
Captain Murphy said again. “We’ll 
get that barge loaded and we’ll get 
out.” 

Sal sat up. The pills had made 
his heart settle down a bit, and his 
hands were comparatively calm. 

“Is the barge almost loaded 
now? It better be,” Sal said. 
“They’ll attack any minute now. I 
know that much.” 

“Another hour’s all we need. If 
they attack before then we can hold 
them off long enough to get that 
barge into the river. Once we get 
into the river with it, we’ll be safe. 
We can float her down and into the 
sea. Somewhere along the coast 
we’ll land and wherever it is will be 
fine for us. We’ll have licked the 
Children. They know we’ve found 
the only eatable food stores in God 
knows how many thousands of 
miles in this goddamned wasteland. 
They can’t live another month 
without this stuff, and we’re taking 
it all down the river. That’s right 
isn’t it, Doc?” 

Cartley looked up. “But as I said 
before, squeezing a little more life 
out of ourselves doesn’t mean any- 

THE CHASM 



thing to me. What do we want to 
get away and live a little longer 
for? It doesn’t make sense, except 
in a ridiculous selfish way. So we 
live another month, maybe six 
months, or a year longer? What 
for?” 

Sal glanced at Murphy who fi- 
nally sat down. 

“We want to live,” Murphy said 
thickly, and he gripped his hands 
together. “Survival. It’s a natural 
law.” 

“What about the survival of the 
species?” Cartley asked. “By run- 
ning out and taking the food, we’re 
killing ourselves anyway. So I don’t 
think I’ll be with you, Murphy.” 

“What are you going to do? Stay 
here? They’ll torture you to death. 
They’ll do to you what they did to 
Donaldson, and all the others 
they’ve caught. You want to stay 
for that kind of treatment?” 

“We ought to try. Running off, 
taking all this food, that means 
they’re sure to die inside a few 
weeks. They might catch a few rats 
or birds, but there aren’t even 
enough of those around to sustain 
life beyond a few days. So we kill 
the future just so we can go on 
living for a little longer. We’ve got 
no reason to live when we know the 
race will die. My wife refused to 
fight them. They killed her, that’s 
true, but I still think she was right. 
We’ve got to make one more at- 
tempt to establish some kind of 
truce with the Children. If we had 
that, then we might be able to start 
building up some kind of relation- 
ship. The only way they can sur- 
vive, even if they had food, is to 
absorb our knowledge. You know 

47 




that. Without our knowledge and 
experience, they’ll die anyway, even 
if they had a thousand years of food 
supplies.” 

“It can’t be done,” Murphy said. 

Cartley looked at the shadows for 
a long time. Finally he shook his 
head. “I don’t have any idea how 
to do it. But we should try. We can’t 
use discipline and power because 
we’re too weak. And too outnum- 
bered. We’d have to do that first in 
order to teach them, and we can’t. 
So there has to be some other way.” 

“Faith?” Sal said. He shook his 
head. “They don’t believe in any- 
thing. You can’t make any appeal 
to them through faith, or ethics, 
any kind of code of honor, nothing 
like that. They’re worse than ani- 
mals.” 

Cartley stood up wearily and 
started to walk away. “They hate 
us,” he said. “That’s the one thing 
we’re sure of. We’re the means and 
they’re the ends. We made them 
what they are. They’re brutalized 
and motivated almost completely 
by hatred. And what’s underneath 
hatred?” He turned back toward 
Murphy. “Fear.” 

Sal stood up. “I never thought of 
them as being afraid,” he said. 

“That doesn’t matter,” Murphy 
said. “It’s the hate and vicious bru- 
tality we have to deal with. You do 
whatever you want to do, Cartley. 
We’ve voted, and we’ve voted to 
move the stuff out tonight on the 
barge. The world we helped make 
is dead, Cartley. The Children grew 
up in a world we killed. We’ve all 
got bad consciences, but we can’t 
do anything about it. The chasm 
between them and us is too wide. 



It was wide even before the bombs 
fell. And the bombs made it a hell 
of a lot wider. Too wide to put any 
kind of bridge across now.” 

“Just the same, we ought to die 
trying,” Cartley said. When he 
went outside, Sal followed him. 

The barge was about loaded. All 
outer defense units had been pulled 
in and were concentrated on the 
head of the pier behind walls of 
sandbags. Burp guns and machine 
guns were ready, and the barge lay 
along the side of the pier in the 
moonlight like a dead whale. There 
were several sewer openings near 
the head of the pier. Men were 
stationed around these sewers with 
automatic rifles, hand grenades and 
flame throwers. 

Sal walked to where Cartley 
stood leaning against the partly 
closed door of the rotting ware- 
house. Jagged splinters of steel and 
wood angled out against the sky. 

After a while, Sal said softly, 
“Well, what could we try to do, 
Doc?” 

Cartley turned quickly. Some of 
the anguish in his eyes had gone 
away, and he gripped Sal’s shoul- 
ders in hands surprisingly strong 
for so old a man. “You want to 
help me try?” 

“Guess I do. Like you said, we 
only have a little time left anyway. 
And if we can’t help the Children, 
what’s the good of it?” 

They stood there in the shadows 
a while, not saying anything. 

“This way,” Cartley said. He led 
Sal down away from the pier and 
along the water’s edge. Dry reed 
rustled, and mud squished under 
their shoes.

“Here,” Cartley said. There was 
a small flat-bottomed rowboat, and 
in it were several cartons of food 
supplies, all in cans. There were 
also several large tins of water. 

“We’ll need a little time,” Cart- 
ley said. “We’ll have to wait. I 
figure we’ll row upstream maybe a 
few hundred yards, and hole up in 
one of those caves. We can watch, 
Sal. We can watch and wait and 
try to figure it out.” 

“Sure,” Sal said. “That seems 
the only way to start.” 

Cartley sat down on the bank 
near the boat, and Sal sat down 
too. 

“The Children,” Cartley said, 
“never had a chance to be any 
other way. But we’re the oldsters, 
and we’ve got this obligation, Sal. 
Man’s a cultural animal. He isn’t 
bom with any inherent concepts of 
right, or wrong, or good or bad, or 
even an ability to survive on an ani- 
mal level. We have to be taught to 
survive by the elders, Sal. And 
we’re the elders.” He hesitated, 
“We’re the only ones left.” 

A flare of horrid light exploded 
over the warehouse down river and 
it lit up Cartley’s face and turned it 
a shimmering crimson. His hands 
widened to perfect roundness and 
he raised his hands in a voiceless 
scream to stop the sudden explo- 
sions of burp guns, grenades, ma- 
chine guns, and rifles. 

Looking down river then, Sal 
could see the flames eating up 
through the warehouse. The pier, 
the barge, everything for a hundred 
square yards was lit up as bright as 
day, and the flare spread out over 
the river and made a black omi- 



nous shadow of the opposite bank. 

“They’re getting away,” Cartley 
said. 

Sal watched the barge move out. 
The Children came screaming out 
of the blazing warehouse, overran 
the pier, streamed into the water. 
But a steady blast of fire from the 
barge drove them back, and in a 
few more minutes the barge dis- 
solved downriver into darkness. 

Cartley’s hands were shaking as 
he gripped Sal’s arm. “Let’s go 
now. We need time. Time may help 
us a lot, Sal. We can wait and 
watch. We can figure something 
out.” 

Sal heard the screams and mock- 
ing savage cries coming up over 
the water, and then the jagged cries 
of some oldsters who hadn’t man- 
aged to get away. 

Still looking downstream toward 
the blazing pier, Sal pushed Cart- 
ley into the rowboat, and they 
shoved off. Sal started rowing, but 
he kept looking back. 

“They should have put them in 
the same shelters with us,” Sal said, 
“that would have made a differ- 
ence. But they put us in separate 
shelters.” 

Only the oldest and the young- 
est had been saved. The old out of 
pity and because they were help- 
less, had been granted the safety of 
shelters. The young because they 
were the symbols of hope had been 
granted shelters, too. 

“No,” Cartley said. “It started 
long before that. The chasm was 
building up long before the war. 
This alienation between the young 
and the old. Between the sun and

knowing you're completely expendable is just 



ROUTINE 



for a 

HORNET 



A LARM BELLS filled the ward- 
room, screaming off the metal 
walls and filling the room with 
their flat, metallic clang. Gressey 
leaped up, spilling the table with 
its checkerboard to the floor. 

Running to the suitlocker, he 
wondered if the bells had to be 
loud enough to jar a man’s mind. 
The other on-duty men in the 



wardroom were running with him, 
and the corridor outside reverber- 
ated to the sound of pounding feet 
on metal. As his hand automat- 
ically manipulated the zippers on 
his G-suit, he noticed that his heart 
was beating furiously. At this point, 
Gressey had never been able to tell 
whether he was frightened or not. 
As far as he could know from what

his belly told him, there was no 
physical difference between plain 
old chicken fear and the body’s 
normal preparation for action. 

The men pounded ‘up’ the metal 
stairs to the Hornet’s Nest on the 
satellite’s rim. The Hornet’s Nest. 
Cressey thought suddenly how ir- 
rational it was. When a nickname 
stuck, it carried its aura to every- 
thing around it. He didn’t know 
what live-wire journalist had first 
used the name Hornets for the 
Primary Interceptor Command, but 
now, inevitably, the launching racks 
were Hornet’s Nests and the sleek 
missiles Stingers. 

He suddenly felt slightly naus- 
eated. He hated this light-headed, 
slightly sick feeling, listening to 
the roaring of blood in his head 
and the thundering of his heart. 
The medics had told him these 
physical symptoms were just na- 
ture’s way of preparing the body 
for sudden activity. Cressey didn’t 
know. It felt like fear to him, and 
he was afraid now. 

His ship this run was PIC-503, 
and when he reached it the Sting- 
ers were just coming up the load- 
ing elevators. Long, slim, twenty- 
foot pencils of death, glistening in 
the harsh glare of the overheads. 
They had their own sort of lethal 
beauty, those Stingers, and a power 
about them, as if they were 
quiescently submitting to these 
puny men for now, for their own 
mechanical reasons. 

Each Hornet carried two Sting- 
ers, slung beneath the stubby delta- 
wings. The Stingers were twice the 
length of the Hornet itself, pro- 
jecting fore and aft of the ship for 

52 



five feet in either direction. The 
Hornet looked ungainly, riding 
atop those slim needles, like some 
grotesque parasite hitching a ride 
on two silver arrows. 

They're — quite small. Who had 
said that? Mackley. Captain Mack- 
ley, the glib Information Officer 
who’d told Cressey everything he 
was allowed to know about Hor- 
nets before he saw one. 

I'll be frank with you, Mr. 
Cressey. Strategic Command has 
Hornets listed not as aircraft, but 
as portable launching racks. Their 
job is to take Stingers to the Out- 
space ships. There's a man in them 
because we can't build a computer 
as efficient as man at such light 
weight. And we couldn't afford 
to if we had the necessary knowl- 
edge. 

Cressey remembered his shock 
at being told he was a light-weight 
computer, and some of the bitter- 
ness. He watched the loading crew 
lock the Stingers into position be- 
neath the Hornet’s wings and 
throw the hooked boarding ladder 
over the edge of the cockpit. Cres- 
sey mounted past the red-painted 
NO STEP signs on the wings and 
settled himself in the cramped 
cockpit. As the crew carried the 
ladder away, he flipped the switch 
by his left hand and listened to the 
hum as the canopy rolled forward 
and locked into place with a metal- 
lic clack. NO STEP, he thought 
wearily. His own god-damned life, 
entrusted to a piece of equipment 
too delicate to step on. 

He swung the fish-bowl over his 
head and locked it into place. He 
coupled the hose leading from his 

DON BERRY 




right hip to a similar hose which 
disappeared into the floor of the 
cockpit, and partially inflated his 
suit. No detectable leaks. If his 
check crew had done their job, he 
was ready. 

Opening the communications 
channel, he listened to the other 
‘hot’ Hornets checking off. 

“427.” 

“Ready out.” 

“493.” 

“Ready out.” 

“495.” 

“Ready sir. Out.” 

“501.” 

“My fuel gauge doesn’t register, 
sir.” 

“Scratch 501. 503.” 

“Ready out,” replied Cressey. He 
wondered what was wrong with 
501. No fuel? Or gauge just out 
of whack somehow? The way the 
Hornets were built, you could never 
be sure of anything. They were 
made for one trip, no more. No 
matter how the intercept worked 
out, they never went home again. 
There was not much money wasted 
in their construction. Mackley had 
easily justified that, too. 

Cressey, you must understand one 
thing . We are desperate . The Out - 
spacers caught us totally unpre- 
pared, and some of the measures 
we must resort to are not what we 
would normally desire , 

When the Outspacers came into 
the system, six years ago, we had 
only two manned satellites in opera- 
tion, Within two years this was 
increased to six, and it was still in- 
adequate, For this reason, another 
ring of stations was set up, this time 
one-man Detector Posts . There are 

ROUTINE FOR A HORNET 



twelve of them, two reporting to 
each Satellite Base . Their of bit is 
roughly half-way between the orbits 
of Earth and Mars . T wo concentric 
circles about the Earth, do you see? 
When an Outspacer crosses D-line, 
a signal is flashed to the nearest 
Satellite Base and the Hornets 
launched. 

The point Tm trying to make, 
Cressey, is this: it took nearly forty 
years to set up the first manned 
satellite, and that after all the 
means were in our hands. Then, in 
just over two years, we put up four 
more satellites and twelve D-Posts. 
We were not geared for that effort. 

Translated into personal terms, 
Mackley had meant that the planet 
could not afford to enclose Cressey 
in an adequate ship. Too much 
would be lost if the Outspacer 
weapons caught it. 

The loading crew had retreated 
into the sealed cubicle from which 
they would watch the launching. 
The huge, curved walls of the hull 
began to roll back, and even in the 
cockpit, Cressey could hear the air 
roar out into space with a brief ex- 
plosion of sound. The air hissed out 
of his cockpit, and his suit inflated 
full. Still no leak. 

He felt a momentary panic as the 
launching rack swung him out, 
pointed away from the Satellite 
directly into the emptiness of space. 
Now he could not see the reassur- 
ing bulk of the mother ship. He 
was alone, with only the incredible 
myriads of stars before him, and 
the two needle points of the 
Stingers projecting full into their 
mass. The tens of thousands of 
bright specks that seemed so close 

53 




gave no comfort. His eyes told him 
space was full, crammed to burst- 
ing with stars, and his mind told 
him it was as empty as death. 

Pointed out into loneliness, riding 
the two graceful arrows, Cressey 
heard the Communicator rasp, 
“Gentlemen, you are on an inter- 
cept to an Outspace ship. The 
safety of your world rides with you. 
Do your job well. ,, The hypocriti- 
cal son-of-a-bitch, thought Cressey 
angrily, sitting in his snug control 
room telling us to do our job! Well, 
maybe it made an impression on 
the first-timers, he couldn’t remem- 
ber. This was his third, and he 
could no longer remember any 
farther back than when he climbed 
into the cockpit. It was better not 
to remember his other missions, 
much better. 

The roar seemed to come a split 
second before the pressure, and 
then Cressey was slammed into his 
acceleration cradle by the sudden 
impact. His body suddenly weighed 
over a thousand pounds, and his 
blood sloshed wearily in his veins 
as a straining heart refused to 
pump such a load. 

“Captain Mackley ,” said Cressey, 
“I’ve heard it said that Earth is 
the aggressor in this war.” 

“Have you ever seen the London 
Crater ?” asked the Information 
Officer . 

“Pictures, yes, but what 1 want 
to know is, who attacked first?” 

“It doesn’t really matter, does it 
Cressey? There is a war, and we’ve 
got to fight it, no matter how it 
started.” 

“Yes sir ,” said Cressey, “but 1 



wanted to know’’ 

“All right, I’ll tell you then . The 
Outspacers contacted this system 
roughly six years ago . The first 
eighteen months they spent on the 
outer planets . During the second 
year they came in as far as Mars, 
and established a base there. Six 
months later, one of their ships left 
on an obvious course toward Earth . 
It was destroyed by a missile 
launched from Satellite II.” Mack- 
ley shrugged. “You know the rest . 
They retaliated. Satellite II was 
vaporized .” 

“But Earth fired first?” 

“I told you, it doesn’t make any 
difference now. One Outspacer 
later got through the defense rings, 
and now there’s nothing from Lon- 
don to Cambridge but glass. What- 
ever the hell they use for weapons, 
they’re effective.” 

“So we don’t know whether or 
not they were originally hostile .” 
“No, we don’t. It had to be 
assumed they were. We were not 
in a position to make allowances. 
You must realize , Cressey, we were 
dealing with something totally un- 
precedented, a completely unknown 
force. Common sense is enough to 
tell you the Outspacer had to be 
considered inimical to us, until 
proven otherwise.” 

“They weren’t given much of a 
chance to prove it.” 

“That may be. The point is ir- 
relevant at the moment. We are 
committed to a line of action, and 
we must follow it through. On their 
part, the Outspacers are doing the 
same.” 

Cressey was silent for a moment, 
and Mackley continued in a softer 

DON BERRY 



54 




voice . “Look here, son . I don’t 
have to tell you all this . J could 
just as easily shoot you full of starry - 
eyed patriotism and send you out 
to save the world from the Bug- 
Eyed Monsters, but the military 
isn’t doing things that way any 
more . There is a possibility that 
we’ve made a mistake, I’ll admit 
that, but we’re stuck with the con- 
sequences of the original action . 
We’re defending our planet with 
everything we’ve got. The Hornets 
are the only weapon that has 
proven even remotely effective.” 

“ I’ll have to think it over, Cap- 
tain.” 

“Of course,” said Mackley. “It’s 
not an easy decision to make. Come 
back again, any time you like, and 
we’ll talk it over some more.” 

And Cressey had gone back. 

CGLERATION PRESSURE 
abated, and Cressey’s face re- 
sumed its normal shape. The red 
haze in front of his eyes cleared, 
and he could see out through his 
canopy again. The thick blanket of 
stars remained motionless, though 
he knew he was moving with tre- 
mendous speed toward the Out- 
space ship. 

In front of him behind the in- 
strument panel, he could hear the 
insect-like buzzing as his course 
computer was fed information from 
his Base Satellite. With both the 
outer D-Post and the Satellite 
tracking the enemy, fairly precise 
positioning was possible. Unfortu- 
nately, because of the enormous dis- 
tances involved, not precise enough 
to pinpoint the Stingers themselves. 

ROUTINE FOR A HORNET 



You had to be closer to do that, 
and the way to get closer was in a 
Hornet. 

For a few minutes now, Cressey 
had only to watch his own scope 
for the first pip, and consider his 
insane position. It was his third 
mission. Of nearly a thousand Hor- 
netmen, forty-three had more than 
one mission. If he got out of this 
one, he had two more before com- 
pulsory retirement. He was not sure 
he could go two more missions, 
even if he survived physically. 

Five missions, then retirement. It 
had looked good to him, a year ago. 
When he left college for Primary 
Interceptors, it had seemed the 
very best kind of an idea. Five 
missions as a Hometman, then 
home. Home as a hero, as a king. 
At twenty-one he would never have 
to worry about anything again. 
The pension Mackley had men- 
tioned was so high as to be in- 
conceivable. And that was just from 
the government. Being a hero had 
other, less official compensations. A 
shack in Beverly Hills, worth a 
hundred thousand or so? Hell, 
they’d force it on him, just for be- 
ing a hero. A woman? What 
woman could resist a five-mission 
Hornetman? Every daydream he’d 
ever had, and a hundred he’d not 
thought of, free for nothing. Or 
free for running five intercepts. 

It had looked good to him until 
his first mission. Then it had sud- 
denly lost its charm. He had learned 
why, so far, there were no five- 
mission Hometmen. 

Abruptly he heard the “ping” 
telling him his radar was tracking. 
The Satellite had guided him true 

55 





enough. He was within the limited 
range of his own radar. 

“Radar contact made,” he said 
into the lip mike. “503 going on 
manual control. Out.” He clicked 
the Com switch and settled down 
to fixing on his target. 

From the size of the blip on the 
screen, he could see the Outspace 
ship was huge, as all of them were. 
Funny, there had not even been 
enough contact to know how many 
different sorts of ship the Alien 
had. They were not battleships, nor 
cruisers, nor anything else specific. 
They were simply Outspace, and 
he had to seek them out and de- 
stroy them. 

A single ship, as usual. He won- 
dered why they had never sent 
more than one ship at a time. Per- 
haps their thinking was so com- 
pletely foreign it had never oc- 
curred to them. No one knew 
anything about how they thought, 
except that they retaliated when 
attacked. 

Cressey wondered how the con- 
flict looked through Outspacer eyes. 
Perhaps they were completely be- 
wildered by attack. Perhaps those 
god-awful disruptor beams were 
meant for some other, more peace- 
ful purpose, and were being pressed 
into use as an emergency weapon 
by "frightened beings. It was even 
possible the aliens did not know 
they were under attack by sentient 
creatures, and wrote off the loss of 
their ships to natural calamity of 
some unknown nature. 

There were a thousand maybes. 
It useless to speculate in the total 
absence of data. You couldn’t be 
sure of anything, so you couldn’t 

56 



take any chances. You had- to act 
as though they were hostile just to 
be on the safe side. The malignant 
neurosis of humanity, making it be- 
have as though all things unknown 
were dangerous. Or perhaps just 
realistic thinking. You couldn’t 
know, unless you knew all about 
the universe. Perhaps the idea of 
conscious animosity was incompre- 
hensible to the Outspacers, but 
there was no way to tell. He reached 
between his legs to the cockpit 
floor and threw the switches there, 
arming the Stinger warheads. 

On his first mission he had 
actually gotten within visual range 
of the Outspace ship, launching 
the Stingers at not more than three 
miles range. The ship had been 
bulky, almost grotesque by his own 
standards, covered with lumps and 
bulges of indeterminate purpose. 
There had been no lights visible, 
no ports. Perhaps the Aliens did 
not see in our spectrum, or perhaps 
they had radiation screens across 
the ports, there was no way to tell. 

Cressey smiled ruefully. This 
miserable war was turning him into 
a philosopher. 

On his second mission he had not 
seen his target. He had launched 
at six miles, out of fear, trusting to 
the followers in the Stingers’ noses 
to track. He did not know what the 
result had been either time. He had 
turned and run for home at full 
acceleration, and he fully intended 
to do the same on this mission. 
There was such a thing as pushing 
your luck too far, and he needed 
all he had. 

The pip on his screen drifted to 
the left, and he gave a short burst 

DON BERRY 




to center it He begrudged ha^ittg 
to use his infinitesimal fuel on 
tracking when he needed it so 
desperately to go home. He looked 
through the canopy, but saw 
nothing, and returned his eyes to 
the screen. The telltale pip had 
drifted slightly to the right. He had 
overcorrected. Cursing, he fired 
another burst, shorter this time, 
with the left bank, and watched the 
pip center. That was good enough. 

His ranging said only twelve . 
miles, his speed two mps, relative 
to target. One second, two seconds, 
three — there it was, occulting a tiny 
area of star patched sky. 

Out of the corner of his eye he 
saw a bright flare as some other 
Hornet disappeared in the wave of 
energy released by its molecular dis- 
ruption. Then another, in another 
quadrant. The Alien was fighting 
back. He jabbed violently at the 
Stinger release, and saw the two 
pencils roar fiercely out ahead of 
him on their own power. He cut his 
flimsy launching rack into as tight 
a turn as it would take. The fa- 
miliar red haze clouded his vision, 
and just before blacking out he 
fired another last long burst on the 
rockets to head him toward home. 

“You understand ," said Mackley , 
“that the amount of fuel we can 
pack into a Hornet is severely 
limited by the size of the craft. 
There is not enough to perform the 
complicated braking maneuvers 
necessary to return to the Satellite . 

“Therefore, the Hornets make no 
attempt to return to the Satellite 
from which they were launched . 
Instead, they return directly to 

ROUTINE FOR A HORNET 



Etirth. This may sound contradic- 
tory, but remember that the planet 
has a heavy envelope of air, which 
the Satellite Bases, of course, have 
not . We use that air to brake the 
ships, through friction " 

“But Captain, wouldn't the Hor- 
net burn as soon as it touched 
atmosphere ?" 

“Ordinarily, if it plunged directly 
in, yes. But there are techniques for 
slowing your flight through fric- 
tion without heating excessively . 
Basically, the operation is the same 
as skipping a flat stone on a lake . 
The Hornet actually only skims the 
atmosphere, entering at a very 
shallow angle. The entire delta- 
wing of the ship is a control sur- 
face . That much area, even at such 
extreme heights, gives a certain 
amount of control, and the pilot 
can pull up out of the atmosphere 
again before heating has become 
too extreme . He has also been con- 
siderably slowed by the same fric- 
tion which causes the heating. Do 
you follow me?" 

“Yes, I suppose so, but it seems 
pretty tricky ." \ 

“It is tricky, Cressey, and you 
never want to forget it. It takes 
a very considerable amount of 
piloting skill, but it can be done." 

“Captain, how many Hornets do 
you lose trying to get in like that?" 

Mackley hesitated momentarily. 
“Our losses are right around thirty- 
seven percent. That's due to enemy 
fire. It's high, but under the cir- 
cumstances, it isn't extreme. We're 
fighting at a disadvantage, and 
combat is not a gentle affair. Men's 
lives are lost. That's been true ever 
since two cave men took after each 

57 




other with stone axes. It was true 
with hows and arrows and muzzle 
loaders. It was true with tanks and 
machine guns , and it is true now. 

“It is expected in a combat situa- 
tion that men will die. One of the 
aims of military strategy has always 
been to keep as many of your own 
men alive as possible . This has not 
changed either. But combat is, 
after all, combat; and there are 
some unavoidable risks” 

“ What's the total loss , Captain? 
1 mean from enemy action and 
from the hazards of this skip ap- 
proach you were talking about?” 
The Information Officer stared 
at Cressey for what seemed like a 
long time before he answered. “Our 
total losses, Mr. Cressey, are roughly 
ninety-three percent.” 



W HEN CRESSEY regained 
consciousness, the Earth was 
a great globe, filling his entire field 
of vision. He could not estimate his 
distance, though he thought he was 
within the Satellite ring. His speed 
would plunge him into atmosphere 
shortly, too shortly. 

Within seconds he began to feel 
the warmth as he entered the re- 
gion where a few air molecules be- 
gan to brush over the surfaces of 
his ship. He rotated the delta-wings 
full, but there was no response. He 
was not yet deep enough into the 
sea of air for the control surfaces 
to react. He watched the tips of 
the wings, so ridiculously close to 
him, though he knew he would not 
be able to see anything. Soon he 
begap to feel a gentle bucking mo- 
tion as the wings met resistance. 

58 



He flattened them out, horizontal, 
and began to draw them up again 
slowly, so they would move the 
tiny ship upward instead of simply 
tearing off at the roots. 

The heat was already uncom- 
fortable, and he was slowing. Now 
he was pressed forward against the 
seat belt as deceleration increased. 
The control surfaces bit into the 
thin air more solidly now, and 
Cressey thought the nose had come 
up a bit, but it was so slight he 
couldn’t be sure. The bucking mo- 
tion was more pronounced, but 
there was nothing he could do 
about that. 

Slowly, slowly. The wings had to 
tilt so very slowly, or they would be 
ripped from the pod-like hull, leav- 
ing it to plummet into thick air and 
glow briefly like a cigarette in the 
dark before it plunged down to 
earth. His face was wet behind the 
fishbowl, but he could not reach it 
to wipe the sweat away. Nor could 
he have taken his hands away from 
the controls in any case. 

The nose had come up, he was 
certain of that now. He was defi- 
nitely rising, but the heat was be- 
coming unbearable. Imperceptibly, 
a thin shrieking had arisen in the 
cabin, almost out of sonic range, 
just enough to make a man’s nerves 
feel as if they had been dragged 
across a rough file. The heat trans- 
mitted through the body of the pod 
and into the bucket was beginning 
to bum his legs. He was being held 
out of the seat itself by the force of 
his deceleration, but the backs of 
his calves still touched metal. He 
thought he could smell the fabric 
of his suit burning, but realized it 

DON BERRY 




was probably his overwrought 
imagination. 

His cheeks felt too large, puffed 
out, as though strong, implacable 
hands were pulling all his loose 
flesh forward. His eyes strained for- 
ward, threatening to come out of 
their sockets. The red haze began, 
and he had a sudden frightening 
thought that he might lose con- 
sciousness before the Hornet had 
well begun its rise out of atmos- 
phere. The red darkened into black. 

He regained consciousness. The 
first skip had been made. The ship 
began to settle back into atmos- 
phere again, and now its speed was 
lower. With each pass the heat 
would become more intense, as the 
plane would not have a chance to 
cool completely before it began to 
heat again. He had to maintain a 
delicate balance between going 
deep enough to slow him, but not 
so deep he couldn’t bring the ship 
up before it burned, cherry-red. His 
body was drenched as by a shower, 
and the inner lining of his suit felt 
soggy from sweat. 

The second skip was worse than 
the first, and he lost consciousness 
almost too soon. The third was 
worse than the second. After the 
fourth, he could not lift high 
enough to clear atmosphere. He 
had gone too deep, and was now 
bound by the great mass of Earth 
below. 

He was still at a shallow angle, 
relative to the ground. He estimated 
he would make at least one com- 
plete orbit, perhaps two, before his 
spiralling trajectory brought him to 
the contact point on the surface. If 
he were still conscious, he would

leave the aircraft at 30,000 feet, 
and hope. He knew his speed was 
still too high, well over Mach 2, 
higher than it had been on either 
of his other approaches/ The ship 
was threatening to tear apart under 
the furious pounding it was taking 
from air and shock waves. 

Hobson’s choice. Bail out high, 
and suffocate because the auto- 
matic chute release would not allow 
him to make a delayed opening. 
Bail out low, and the thick air 
would pound his body to a pulp, 
and below the steel webbed chute 
would hang nothing but a suit, full 
of a still, red messiness. 

The timing had to be precision 
itself, but it had to be done by 
guesswork. There was no training 
that could prepare a man for this. 
It was all new. He uncoupled the 
air hose leading to his suit, and 
placed his hand on the ejector 
lever. He knew he was too high, 
but the wings showed quivering 
signs of buckling under the strain. 

He pulled the lever, releasing the 
canopy and arming the seat car- 
tridge. The canopy disappeared 
miraculously from over his head. 
He was deafened by the thunder- 
ous roar of air that entered the 
cramped cockpit, like an explosion 
peak that remained constant, 
not diminishing. Instinctively, he 
ducked his head, recoiling at the 
sound. He did not remember trig- 
gering the seat ejector. 

Cressey fell. The seat dropped 
away from him, the incredibly 
strong parachute opened, all auto- 
matically. He fell forty-five thou- 
sand feet into the Pacific Ocean,

H OW DO you get rid of a 
superman? 

The method Masefield Truggles 
used was the tried-and-true Mase- 
field Truggles method. Of course, 
he didn’t know at the beginning 
that Blan Forsythe was a superman. 
But Forsythe had lived in Marston 
Hill most of his life — born there, 
in fact — while Truggles had been 
there only two years. So Truggles 
gave the case the full treatment 
with flourishes, including a care-

ful reconnaissance to determine 
vulnerable spots in Forsythe’s repu- 
tation. 

Truggles determined that reform 
or removal of Forsythe would be 
his contribution to the moral wel- 
fare of Marston Hill as soon as he 
heard the rumors, some joking, 
some serious, about Forsythe’s 
polygamous tendencies. This was a 
ready-made situation for Truggles. 

Truggles began his research with 
Forsythe’s ex-wife, Phyllis Allison. 
He had learned from experience 
that an ex-wife usually is a good 
source of information about vulner- 
able spots. 

She served him tea in the parlor 
of her modest home. After a routine 



61 



round of chit-chat designed to put 
her at ease, Truggies approached 
the point. 

“As you may know, Mrs. Allison, 
I am president of our Social Stand- 
ards Protective League,” he said, 
fixing his deep blue eyes on her 
face. 

“I’ve heard of it, Mr. Truggies,” 
she said in a low voice. “My duties 
at home keep me too busy to be- 
long to any organizations, though.” 

As if to emphasize her point, she 
put her arm around the shoulders 
of her young son. The boy sat 
quietly beside her, watching Trug- 
gies like a young animal. Truggies 
figured he must be about five years 
old — certainly he would be below 
school age, for school was in session 
— but he was big for his age. There 
was something disturbing about his 
intent gaze. 

“I’m not here in the interest of 
your joining the League, Mrs. 
Allison, though we’d be glad to 
have you,” said Truggies. “I came 
to ask you for some confidential in- 
formation about the shameful way 
your former husband mistreated 
you.” 

Her eyes opened wide. 

“Why, Blan never mistreated 
me!” she exclaimed. “Whoever 
told you such a thing? I loved Blan, 
and he loved me. I still love him.” 

“If he loved you, why did he 
leave you?” demanded Truggies 
triumphantly. 

“I think you’re asking questions 
about something that isn’t any of 
your business, Mr. Truggies,” said 
Phyllis Allison, her eyes flashing 
ominously. “Blan Forsythe is . 
different. We agreed to separate 

62 



because it appeared I could give 
him no children. We were wrong, 
but it was too late, then.” 

“So he turned to polygamy 
through a mad desire to produce 
children,” murmured Truggies 
happily. “You say you were wrong? 
I thought the boy was your only 
child.” 

“Donald is my only child, but 
he is Blan’s child,” said Phyllis, 
patting the boy on the shoulder. 

Truggies raised bushy eyebrows. 

“Wasn’t it seven years ago you 
and Mr. Forsythe were divorced?” 
he asked pointedly. 

“Yes, and Donald is only five,” 
she answered defiantly. “My hus- 
band — Dr. Allison — tells me I’m 
foolish to have the feeling I do that 
Donald is Blan’s son. He says it’s 
impossible. But I know it’s true. 
I’ve been working with Donnie, 
and, Mr. Truggies . .” 

She leaned forward intently and 
fixed her gaze gravely on Truggies’ 
face. 

“. Donnie has the Power!” 
she said in a tense whisper. 

Truggies blinked. Phyllis Allison 
sat back and looked embarrassed, 
as though she had not intended to 
confide so much. 

Truggies asked no more ques- 
tions. He did not pursue the line of 
inquiry this revelation at once 
brought to mind. He took his leave 
as graciously as possible and left 
the house. 

He knew that both Phyllis Alli- 
son and her son watched him as he 
walked out the door with shoul- 
ders bent in a show of humility. But 
it wks the boy’s eyes he felt. 

Phyllis Allison. The fresh memory 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




of her slender beauty, her wide, 
honest eyes, struck pain in Trug- 
gles’ heart. They were rare — but 
why did he seem to run across them 
so often? — these women who re- 
minded him of her. His lost love, 
his long-lost love, the smiling fairy 
with the dancing heart, without 
whom life never had been quite 
complete again. 

The woman really believed the 
boy was Blan Forsythe’s child. It 
was pathetic. And that reference to 
Donald’s having “the power:” 
Truggles wondered how many 
women he had known who thought 
their sons were “different,” who 
even convinced themselves that the 
children had been sired by a dream 
prince or such like. Deluded souls, 
to so excuse their sins! 

He straightened and ran his 
fingers through his short-clipped 
gray hair as he strode along the 
walk. The extensive lawn of Blan 
Forsythe’s mansion stretched only 
two doors away from the bungalow 
he had just left. It was decked with 
flower beds and evergreens. 

Truggles was too circumspect to 
do anything openly at this stage. 
But he shook a fist at the stone pile, 
mentally. 

Behind him, Truggles had a 
record of nothing but successes. 
There had been the alcoholic in 
Han town, the Negro fortuneteller 
in New Bacon, the member of some 
queer religious sect in Steckleville. 
Truggles had set his face against 
them. He had shown the people of 
these towns what manner of crea- 
tures they harbored in their bosoms. 
They had been driven out (it was 
unfortunate, in a way, that the 

FAMILY TREE 



alcoholic had been hit by a brick 
and killed in the confusion of pub- 
lic reaction, but such accidents 
happen) ; and eventually Truggles 
himself, purring inwardly at the 
consciousness of a job well done, 
had moved on to fields of further 
effort. 

Blan Forsythe was not big 
enough to escape his righteous- 
ness. 

If the mayor of Marston Hill 
would cooperate, it would save 
Masefield Truggles a lot of work 
and possibly some unpleasantness 
for everyone. Sometimes mayors 
did cooperate, especially when 
elections weren’t far off. 

Truggles was not offended that 
Mayor Ben Sands received him in 
the garden of his home on the edge 
of town. He had known many fine 
gentlemen with dirt on their hands 
who abhorred dirt in the mind. 

“I haven’t seen Blan much lately, 
but he used to spend a lot of time 
out here,” said Sands, taking his 
battered pipe from his mouth to 
speak. “He was interested in the 
flowers. Those asters, now. They’re 
tetraploid. He developed ’em. Used 
colchicine.” 

He looked at Truggles inquiring- 
ly, to see if he understood. Truggles 
allowed a smile to quirk his lips 
and shook his head slightly. 

“Extract from the autumn cro- 
cus,” said Sands. “Makes plants 
tend to double their chromosomes.” 

Around them, the garden was a 
solid blaze of color. Zinnias, mari- 
golds, phlox cast their colorful 
bounty to the air. 

“I’m afraid I’m not much of a 

63 




horticulturist,” apologized Trug- 
gles. 

“Well, it’s like this,” said Sands. 
“Every cell of every plant of the 
same species has the same number 
of chromosomes — you know, those 
bright little threads that hold the 
guiding genes of growth and de- 
velopment. Mutations in plants 
come when there are changes in 
individual genes from time to time. 
But when you hit them with 
colchicine, the chromosomes some- 
times double without the cell di- 
viding. Creates a new species, 
usually bigger, stronger, slower 
growing. Call them tetraploids. I’ve 
heard it called ‘cataclysmic evolu- 
tion.’ ” 

“You mean man tampers with 
the basic laws of nature?” asked 
Truggles, awed and disturbed. 

“I reckon you could call it that. 
Lots of plants have been treated 
that way — tomatoes, snapdragons, 
alyssum. Of course, it happens 
naturally, too. Wheat developed 
from the crossing of an inferior 
early species, eink'om, with a wild 
grass. Einkorn and the grass had 
seven chromosomes each, but in 
crossing the chromosomes were 
doubled. The result was Persian 
wheat, a superior variety with 14 
chromosomes.” 

Sands took the pipe from his 
mouth and knocked the ashes out 
against the sole of his shoe. Pulling 
a sack of tobacco thoughtfully from 
his hip pocket, he began to refill it. 

“Blan had a theory,” he said, 
“that doubling of chromosomes in 
animals in the past could have 
given rise to new species and ex- 
plain a lot of gaps in evolution. 

64 



Man has 48 chromosomes in every 
cell, and Blan pointed out to me 
that 48 is double 24, which is dou- 
ble 12, which is double six, which 
is double three. He thought that 
was too much of a coincidence. I 
reckon I do, too.” 

He paused and struck a wooden 
match, holding it against the bowl 
of his pipe and sucking noisily. 

“I don’t hold with the evolu- 
tionary theory,” said Truggles stif- 
fly. “What I really wanted to ask 
you, Mayor Sands, was whether 
you are aware that Blan Forsythe 
is practicing polygamy, right here 
in Marston Hill?” 

“You’ve been listening to those 
old hens gossip,” accused Sands. 
“Look, I knew Blan right well 
when he was married to Phyllis Al- 
lison. Phyllis is my niece and I was 
sorry to see them break up, but the 
young people have to live their own 
lives. Blan has some ideas us old 
stick-in-the-muds might not under- 
stand, Mr. Truggles, but he’s all 
right.” 

“A dozen women live with him 
in that big house of his,” insisted 
Truggles. “I’ve found out there’s a 
turnover, too. When one moves 
out, another moves in.” 

“I don’t poke my nose into other 
people’s business,” said Sands 
bluntly. “But Dr. Allison tells me 
Blan maintains a staff, and it’s con- 
venient for them to live in that big 
house. He’s doing biological re- 
search, along the lines I just ex- 
plained.” 

“Biological research, I have no 
doubt,” said Truggles, assuming his 
best organ-like tone. He fixed his 
blue eyes on Sands, but Sands’ eyes 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




were just as blue. They showed a 
gleam of anger. “You refuse to take 
any action against this abomina- 
tion, then, Mayor?” 

“I refuse to believe idle rumors,” 
said Sands firmly. “And before you 
attempt to stir things up around 
here with your Social Standards 
Protective League, Mr. Truggles, I 
would recommend that you make 
some effort to secure accurate in- 
formation. Dr. Allison is Blan’s re- 
search assistant, and he can tell you 
much more of Blan’s current ex- 
periments than I can.” 

Truggles bowed slightly and 
turned away. The sharp scent of 
the marigolds tickled his nostrils, 
making him want to sneeze. 

“Dr. Allison,” said Sands behind 
him, raising his voice slightly as 
Truggles walked away, “may even 
consent to tell you why Blan For- 
sythe’s face is liver-colored. From 
what I hear of you, Mr. Truggles, 
that probably is your principal 
complaint against him.” 

Truggles straightened as though 
stabbed between the shoulder 
blades. He quickened his pace. 

That had been a telling blow. 
Could Sands know? No, it was im- 
possible. The recurring waves of 
time and travel had long since ob- 
literated Truggles’ distant past. 
The Brazilian was a secret demon 
in his own heart, his private, bitter 
hatred, the swarthy ogre who had 
crushed the flower of his life and 
whose face arose to torment him 
only in times of bitterness. 

Sands was an idiot. All of these 
people in Marston Hill were idiots, 
letting a man like Forsythe fool 
them, liking him, looking up to 

FAMILY TREE 



him. They were empty shells, peo- 
ple, to be possessed alike by the 
strong, whether angel or demon. 
He, Truggles, would pit his strength 
against Forsythe. 

As for Sands . 

Old fool! Entrenched politician! 
Truggles had dealt with such civic 
laxity before. Direct action would 
be necessary. 



T HERE WAS a touch of frost 
on the grass the evening Mase- 
field Truggles went again to the 
Allison home. Dr. Alex Allison, a 
chubby man with rimless spectacles, 
admitted him. 

Truggles caught a glimpse of 
Phyllis Allison and the boy, Donald, 
in the kitchen as Allison led him 
through the dining room. They 
mounted a short flight of stairs to 
Allison’s study. 

Allison offered him wine and a 
cigar. Truggles refused. Allison 
placed the wine decanter back on 
the shelf unopened, but lit a cigar 
and settled back comfortably in his 
chair. 

“Well, Mr. Truggles?” he asked 
briskly, with the air of a man who 
had no time to waste. Truggles 
looked him over, assessing him, and 
decided on the direct attack. 

“I wonder if you are aware, Dr. 
Allison,” he said softly, “that your 
employer is breaking up your 
home?” 

He waited for the reaction. 
There was none. Allison puffed 
calmly on his cigar and waited. 
The light glinted from his spec- 
tacles as he kept his eyes fixed 
steadily on Truggles’ face. 



65 




“Dr. Allison, your wife confessed 
to me that she still loves her former 
husband, Blan Forsythe,” said 
Truggles, emphasizing every word. 

“I was aware of that,” said Al- 
lison unconcernedly. “Most women 
who know Blan are desperately in 
love with him. Is that all you came 
to see me about?” 

He half rose from his chair. 
Truggles made a hurried gesture of 
protest. He realized he had tried to 
move too fast. 

“No, no,” said Truggles hastily. 
“Forgive me, Dr. Allison, but I was 
agitated over the situation. What I 
really came here for was to ask you 
to give me some information about 
Mr. Forsythe.” 

“Why?” asked Allison. 

The flat question caught Trug- 
gles unprepared. He was aware 
that his mouth hung open foolishly 
as he tried desperately to frame an 
answer that would not be too re- 
vealing. 

“Why — I was trying to lay to 
rest some rumors,” he stammered 
at last. “Mayor Sands said you 
might tell me something about Mr. 
Forsythe.” 

Allison was silent for a long min- 
ute. He took the cigar from his 
mouth, knocked half an inch of ash 
into an ashtray and resumed his 
puffing. 

“Mr. Truggles, how much do 
you know about mice?” Allison 
asked. 

Truggles stared at him, unable to 
answer. This interview was begin- 
ning to take on a nightmarish 
aspect. 

“What do you consider to be the 
principal difference between mice 

66 



and men, Mr. Truggles?” pursued 
Allison. 

“Really, Dr. Allison, I don’t see 
— I don’t know what point you’re 
trying to make, but a mouse is an 
animal and a man is — well, a 
man.” 

“Nothing else?” 

“Well, a man is bigger than a 
mouse.” He began to feel familiar 
ground under his feet. “A man is 
bigger more ways than physically. 
He is bigger spiritually, emotional- 
ly. He thinks. He has a — ” 

“Ben Sands told me about his 
talk with you. So you don’t believe 
in evolution? You don’t believe the 
ancestors of men and monkeys 
came from a common stock?” 

“I do not, sir. It is inconceiv- 
able . .” 

“How would mice strike you, 
then? Would you rather believe 
that men descended from mice 
than monkeys?” 

Again the bewildered Truggles 
found himself physically incapable 
of answering. 

“I have done a great deal of re- 
search, with the kind assistance of 
Blan Forsythe,” said Allison pre- 
cisely. “Blan is my friend. He has 
been my associate, even my experi- 
mental animal. I am preparing a 
paper on what I consider a revolu- 
tionary contribution to the theory 
of evolution — that men are related 
directly to the genus rodentia, and 
only more distantly so to the pri- 
mates. 

“Blan Forsythe is the real orig- 
inator of this theory, as a result of 
his very personal interest in sudden 
evolutionary changes through dou- 
bling of chromosomes. It is reason- 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




able to suppose that the ancestor of 
man himself, with all of his survival 
advantages, arose through such a 
process. Man has 48 chromosomes. 
Now, Mr. Truggles, what sort of 
animal would you guess has half 
that number — 24 chromosomes?” 
“Mice?” hazarded Truggles thin- 

ly- 

“Precisely. Mice. The common 
house mouse. There is also a variety 
of squirrel that carries 24 chromo- 
somes. The peromyscus and apode - 
mus families of mice — and some 
other animals, including the rhesus 
monkey — have 48 — cousins whose 
chromosome doubling eons ago 
started them up different paths 
from ours. Mr. Truggles, the ances- 
tor of man was a rodent whose 
doubled chromosomes gave him 
new attributes that worked to his 
evolutionary advantage.” 

“Is that what is called a muta- 
tion?” asked Truggles, interested in 
spite of himself. 

“Mutation? A mutation is a 
change in one gene. Men mutate 
every day. How many millions upon 
millions of years do you think it 
would take simple mutations to 
build a man from a rodent — or a 
lemur, either, for that matter?” 
“Well, really, Dr. Allison, I be- 
lieve you misunderstand what I 
asked you. Your theory is fine, I’m 
sure, among scientists, but I’m in- 
terested in information about Blan 
Forsythe.” 

“That’s what I’ve given you. 
Blan Forsythe is a tetraploid man. 
His cells carry 96 chromosomes in- 
stead of the normal 48. Every cell 
of his body is doubled.” 

“Is that why his skin is liver- 

FAMILY TREE 



colored?” asked Truggles, remem- 
bering what Sands had said. 

Allison smiled. 

“Coincidence,” he said. “It’s true 
that liver cells have doubled 
chromosomes, but that isn’t the 
reason for the color.” 

“What does all this mean, then?” 
asked Truggles. 

Allison laid his half-smoked cigar 
carefully on the edge of the ash- 
tray and gazed at Truggles through 
his spectacles. 

“Blan Forsythe is a new species,” 
he said slowly. “He is not man. 
Everyone has theorized that a su- 
perman might arise from a muta- 
tion, perhaps caused by radiation. 
My God, a hundred mutations of 
individual genes wouldn’t make a 
superman overnight! But Blan 
Forsythe is one — a tetraploid man 
— a superman.” 

“And what is a superman, Dr. 
Allison?” asked Truggles drily, 
thinking of Nietzsche and the Sun- 
day comic strips. 

“Who knows? How can you and 
I comprehend the novel qualities, 
the undreamed-of abilities of such a 
creature? Do you think a mouse 
could understand a man’s ability 
to reason, to talk, to build ma- 
chines? Blan may not realize them 
himself. After all, he was reared in 
a human society, and no doubt the 
tetraploid rodent which is our an- 
cestor seemed little different from 
his associates. There are two things 
I’m sure of: the differences are 
there, and they are qualities you 
and I could never point to and say, 
‘This is an ability of the super- 
man. 

Truggles’ mouth twisted in a 

67 




crooked smile. Allison had allowed 
his enthusiasm to draw him out. 
Allison was vulnerable now. 

“And because this man — this 
creature — is different, you allow 
him to cuckold you?” he demanded 
in a low, ugly voice. 

Allison was not vulnerable. 

“Don’t let Phyllis mislead you,” 
he said quietly. “She thinks Donald 
is Blan’s child because she always 
yearned to give Blan the child he 
wanted. Donald was bom two years 
after they were divorced.” 

“She seems very sure,” insinuated 
Truggles. 

“It is possible for a tetraploid to 
be fertile in a mating with a normal 
diploid,” said Allison. “Persian 
wheat, with 14 chromosomes, 
crossed with a grass which has 
seven chromosomes, to produce 
common wheat. That was Blan’s 
hope while he and Phyllis were 
married, and it’s still his hope with 
the others. I was his doctor and as- 
sociate then, as I am now. Neither 
Phyllis nor Donald has more than 
the normal number of chromo- 
somes, and Blan has not seen Phyllis 
since they were divorced.” 

“What, then, Dr. Allison, is this 
‘Power’ that your wife says the boy 
has?” 

Allison’s face froze. 

“That is a family matter, Mr. 
Truggles,” he said icily. “I do not 
discuss my son’s characteristics with 
strangers. Good night, sir.” 

Truggles saw Phyllis Allison as 
he left the house. Dr. Allison re- 
mained in his study when Truggles 
left, and Phyllis stepped from the 
darkened doorway of the dining 
room as Truggles opened the front 

68 



door. 

“Mr. Truggles,” she said, plac- 
ing her hand on his arm, “I don’t 
know what your object is, but don’t 
make any trouble for Blan For- 
sythe.” 

“My poor child, I am not trying 
to make trouble for him,” said 
Truggles sadly. “I hope only to 
convince him that his unfortunate 
differences do not privilege him to 
flout the sound social customs of 
other men. If there is any trouble, 
it will be made by the man him- 
self.” 

“You’ll see him, then?” 

“Certainly, I intend to try to con- 
vince him personally that what he 
is doing is wrong.” 

She sighed. 

“I wish I could see him again,” 
she murmured. 

For this unhappy woman’s sake 
if for no other reason, it would cer- 
tainly be the thing to do to talk to 
Forsythe himself, Truggles thought 
as he left the house. The anticipa- 
tion had a certain zest to it. Besides, 
Truggles believed in being fair. He 
always liked to give a man a chance 
to reform voluntarily, to bow to his 
righteous persuasion. 

As for Allison, Truggles detested 
a man like that. The “scientific” 
mind, always so sure of its own 
theories. Such men could not see 
beyond the material, into the living 
realm of possession and power, the 
struggle between good and evil. 

This theory that Forsythe was a 
superior creature . Truggles 
shivered with resentment. Man was 
the apex, the conqueror — the con- 
queror through his service to the 
good way, the right way, through 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




his militant demand that things be 
good and right. 

A superior being. Truggles trem- 
bled again, this time overwhelmed 
by a feeling he hated, the feeling of 
inferiority. It swept over him from 
long, long ago, that bitter night 
when he had stood in tears before 
the Brazilian, when he had im- 
plored on his knees the only woman 
he had ever loved. 

Something small and dark scur- 
ried across the walk in front of him. 

Mice, he thought. The idea that 
man descended from a mouse was 
even more repellant than that man 
descended from monkey. But, if 
evolution had any basis in fact, 
mice might have certain claims. 
They lived in human habitations, 
they ate human foods. Their psy- 
chology was studied in mazes, and 
their physical makeup made them 
good subjects for experimentation 
in human diseases. 

Mice. Truggles shrugged and 
walked on. 



M asefield truggles had 

seen Blan Forsythe at a dis- 
tance, walking along the streets of 
Marston Hill, but Forsythe’s ap- 
pearance at close range was a severe 
shock. 

The tetraploid man’s skin was, 
as Sands and Allison had described 
it, the deep red color and texture 
of liver. His hair was short, mole- 
gray fur over the top of his head, 
and his eyes were a jade green that 
glowed with inner fires. Truggles 
was a tall man, but Forsythe stood 
a head taller and was massively 
built. 



Forsythe’s rugged features were 
not repulsive, when one became ac- 
customed to their hue. Still, Trug- 
gles could not understand how a 
woman could be attracted to him. 
But the adoration that shone from 
the eyes of the pretty secretary who 
escorted him into Forsythe’s office 
was unmistakable. 

It was a spacious office, on the 
second floor of the mansion Trug- 
gles had passed so often. Why a 
man needed a business office to 
conduct private biological research 
was something Truggles could not 
understand, but this one would 
have fitted very well in a metro- 
politan skyscraper. 

The weight of the pistol in its 
shoulder holster was comforting to 
Truggles. Others might not believe 
Forsythe dangerous. He did. He 
was protected. 

“I understand you are deter- 
mined to run me out of town, Mr. 
Truggles,” said Forsythe pleasantly, 
leaning back in his swivel chair and 
putting his fingertips together. With 
his back to the window, his face 
was in slight shadow and he looked 
like a well-tanned business execu- 
tive. 

“You either have a well-organ- 
ized spy network or some of the 
strange powers your associates at- 
tribute to you, Mr. Forsythe,” re- 
plied Truggles easily. It would have 
been easier to deal with a man who 
did not exhibit such self-confidence, 
who was a little worried and nerv- 
ous, but everyone seemed to be con- 
spiring to make this project diffi- 
cult for Truggles. 

Forsythe smiled, and his teeth 
were white as shining ivory in his 

69 



FAMILY TREE 




dark face. 

“My extraordinary powers don’t 
lie along those lines, ” he said. “I’d 
be obliged to someone who could 
tell me along what lines they do lie. 
I’ve had flashes of them from time 
to time, but I’m afraid they couldn’t 
be explained to you.” 

“I don’t want to see you run out 
of town, Mr. Forsythe,” said Trug- 
gles. “I came here in the hope of 
offering you friendship and help. 
The people of Marston Hill are 
disturbed — I might say, aroused — 
at your insistence on polygamous 
practices. I hope to persuade you 
to abandon such unsocial behavior, 
so I may have some background 
for reasoning with them in your 
behalf.” 

Truggles expected the usual re- 
tort — that the people of . the town 
had minded their own business 
(i.e., been blind to what was going 
on) until Truggles came to town. 
Instead, Forsythe said: 

“I have conformed to human so- 
cial standards. My formal religious 
affiliation is Mohammedan.” 

Truggles quivered with shock. 

“Mohammedan!” he exclaimed, 
possibly more outraged by that than 
by his original suspicion of poly- 
gamy. 

“The Koran allows us four 
wives, Mr. Truggles. The rest must 
be concubines.” 

“You admit it! You admit that 
your so-called research is only a 
blind for a den of iniquity!” 

. Forsythe rose, and stepped from 
behind his desk. Suddenly alarmed, 
Truggles cringed. Forsythe was a 
very big man. Truggles’ fingers 
strayed toward the shoulder holster. 



But Forsythe smiled* 

“The research is genuine,” he 
said. “Come with me, Mr. Trug- 
gles. I’d like for you to meet several 
of my wives. You may ask them 
questions if you wish.” 

He took the nervous Truggles 
firmly by the arm, lifted him almost 
bodily from his chair and escorted 
him into the anteroom. The pretty 
secretary looked up from her desk. 

“Mr. Truggles, this is Trella, my 
youngest wife,” said Forsythe. 
“Fortunately, she has had secre- 
tarial training, so she fits well in 
this office.” 

The young woman smiled at 
Truggles, without embarrassment. 
He was not so fortunate. He 
dropped his eyes, the deep blue 
eyes that had so often been the 
nemesis of evil-doers. 

“You said I might question the — 
the young lady?” he murmured. 

Forsythe laughed. 

“I’ll leave so you may feel more 
free,” he said, and went back into 
his office. 

Truggles looked upon Trella 
Forsythe with more self-assurance. 
She was a pert, brown-eyed blonde, 
in her early twenties. Remembering 
Phyllis Allison, Truggles could not 
but admire Forsythe’s appreciation 
of beauty. 

“How long have you been mar- 
ried to Mr. Forsythe, Mrs. — uh, 
Miss Trella?” he asked. 

“Only about six months,” she an- 
swered. “I hope I’ll prove satis- 
factory.” 

“Satisfactory?” 

“I don’t want to have to leave 
Blan after two years,” she said. “I 
love him.” 



70 



CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




“My dear child, how can you 
love a man who has a dozen other 
wives? How can you lower yourself 
to be part of such a scheme ?” 

“Why is it that some men never 
understand women?” she coun- 
tered, a little angrily. “A woman 
may be jealous of her man’s other 
loves, but if he’s a real man the 
thing that matters is that he loves 
her . I get along fine with Blan’s 
other wives. We have something in 
common — we all love him.” 

Truggles resisted a strong temp- 
tation to attempt to convert her to 
sanity on the spot. His powers of 
convincing women were potent 
ones, as experience had proved. 
But, in this case, the root of the 
evil was Forsythe himself and there 
was no point in wasting any time on 
the wives. 

Truggles had expected Forsythe 
to conduct him on a tour of what 
he already had labeled, in his mind, 
“the harem.” But Forsythe re- 
mained closeted in his office, and it 
was Trella who escorted Truggles 
through a portion of the building. 

They met three other women, 
busy at various tasks, all of them 
young and attractive. Truggles 
questioned them briefly. He found 
substantially the same reaction he 
had received from Trella. 

When they had mounted the 
wide stairs again, on their way back 
to the office, Truggles was intro- 
duced to another wife, Lois. The 
door of a room stood ajar as they 
came to it, and he happened to see 
her sitting inside, weeping. 

He thought Trella appeared re- 
luctant when he stopped and 
pushed open the door, but she did 

FAMILY TREE 



not protest. 

“Why are you weeping, my 
child?” asked Truggles, after he 
had talked with her for a moment 

“I must leave,” she explained, 
“I’ve been married to Blan twc 
years tomorrow, and I haven’t 
given him a child.” 

“That’s the most inhuman thing 
I ever heard of!” he exclaimed. 
“Do you mean to say he gives you 
this little time of happiness, and 
then if you don’t produce progeny 
for him he casts you off like an old 
shoe?” 

“It’s Dr. Allison’s advice to him,” 
said Lois. “Dr. Allison thinks it 
would be bad for him to have too 
many wives around at one time, 
and he considers two years long 
enough to prove certainly whether 
a woman can be fertile with Blan. 
I’m not the first. I won’t be the 
last. But it’s hard to have to go 
away and never see him again.” 

These women he had seen today, 
these wives of Forsythe: they 

aroused no bitter feelings in Trug- 
gles. He felt clean and strong talk- 
ing to them. They were like the 
many women to whom he had held 
out sympathy and understanding 
over the years, who had been stub- 
born and wilful at first, only to melt 
at last and see the truth. If only he 
could get them from Forsythe’s in- 
fluence, he thought he could save 
these women. 

Truggles turned to Trella. 

“Do you see what’s in store for 
you, young woman?” he demanded. 
“Do you still think it’s worth ruin- 
ing your life to live here in sin with 
. this man?” 

“I may be different,” she an- 

71 




swered calmly. “And if Tm not, tell 
me, Mr. Truggles: does a mouse 
have the right to question the mo- 
tives of a man?” 

Truggles went back into For- 
sythe’s office. The tetraploid man 
had swung his chair away from his 
desk and was staring moodily out 
the big window. He inclined his 
head at Truggles’ entrance, but did 
not speak. 

“Forsythe, this has been the most 
amazing, the most revolting, reve- 
lation I have ever experienced,” 
opened Truggles. His indignation 
fueled his courage now, and his 
voice held the commanding reso- 
nance of a pipe organ. “You claim 
to be superhuman. I say you are 
inhuman, to force these poor young 
women to live in servitude, sharing 
you with each other, and then to 
discard them with brutal uncon- 
cern when you find they cannot 
fulfill your insane dream of foisting 
others of your kind on the earth!” 

“They love me and I have a 
great affection for all of them,” 
said Forsythe, not turning. “I pro- 
vide for them when they leave me. 
Because the great experience of 
love cannot last a lifetime, should 
it be denied altogether?” 

The ancient bitterness swept over 
Truggles in a consuming wave. Yes, 
yes, cried his soul, far better never 
to have loved, never to have known 
the meaning of love, than to have 
it snatched from the grasp in full 
flower! Forsythe was a monster. 
How could he know? Did the su- 
perman have telepathic powers? 
Or was it again chance, this drop- 
ping of a remark that burned deep 

72 



into his writhing memories? 

Forsythe’s face was turned from 
him. One shot and this incredible 
thing, this liver-hued monstrosity 
that sat before him would be re- 
moved from the face of the earth. 
Truggles put his hand inside his 
coat. The butt of the pistol was 
cool under his fingers. 

No. A murderer in prison has no 
influence. He cannot battle evil, re- 
cruiting to his shining leadership an 
army of righteous people. Truggles 
dropped his hand to his lap and 
said calmly: 

“You speak as though they could 
love no one else. Is polygamy, then, 
to be a characteristic of the long- 
heralded superman?” 

“Polygamy and monogamy, as 
such, have no moral values, for 
man or superman,” replied For- 
sythe, speaking to the window. 
“Polygamy was a part of man’s 
social scheme for centuries. Mono- 
gamy has been replacing it as a 
more desirable scheme; but to at- 
tribute moral values to it is propa- 
ganda. I challenge you to find an 
edict against polygamy in the basic 
writings of any religion — Christian- 
ity, Judaism, any of them. Remem- 
ber Solomon? Monogamy has the 
advantage of closer companionship 
between man and woman, and for 
that reason I would prefer it.” 

A great thrill shot through Trug- 
gles’ breast at these words. Was it 
possible that Forsythe had weak- 
ened? Was it possible that he could 
lead this strange man back to the 
path of truth? 

“Why not give it up, Forsythe?” 
he asked in a low, compelling voice. 
“Why not eschew your dream of a 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




new race and leave such things to 
higher powers? Send these poor 
women back to their homes and 
turn back to your one true, legal 
wife, Phyllis, and your son.” 

Forsythe swung to face him. The 
green eyes were deep and haunted. 

“Don’t you think that’s what I 
would prefer, above all else?” he 
asked in a low voice. “Perhaps you 
didn’t know it, but I married 
Phyllis before I knew I was — dif- 
ferent; other than my appearance, 
I mean. The genuine love of a man 
for a woman does not die. Do you 
think even a superman — it’s your 
term, Truggles, not mine — enjoys 
loneliness? The worship of other 
women, my affection for them as 
human beings, can’t fill the gap left 
by the loss of someone who shared 
complete understanding with me.” 

He laughed shortly. 

“Besides,” he added, “you’re try- 
ing to talk me into committing an 
immoral act, Truggles. You forget 
that Phyllis is Dr. Allison’s wife 
now, and Donald is Dr. Allison’s 
son. 

Truggles brushed that aside. 

“That’s no excuse for what 
you’re doing,” he said. 

“One of the major duties of any 
individual, of whatever species, is 
to reproduce his kind, if he can,” 
answered Forsythe soberly. “In the 
human community, safe as a race 
through its very numbers, that has 
been lost sight of and overlaid with 
social responsibilities. I’m different. 
I can’t ignore it. 

“How was the misconception 
ever begotten that a superman — 
again, it’s your term, not mine — 
would merely mate with the daugh- 

FAMILY TREE 



ters of men and, lo! a new race? 
The superman is a new sDecies. 
Species do not interbreed fertilely 
very often, even when closely re- 
lated. 

“Dr. Allison found I was tetra- 
ploid, while Phyllis and I were still 
married. He and I have been 
searching for a tetraploid woman, 
without success. Meanwhile, I try 
and still hope for fertile matings 
with a normal diploid woman, for 
the tetraploid has been fertile with 
the diploid sometimes in plants. 

“No, Donald can’t be my son, 
whatever Phyllis says. There’s more 
involved than the time of his birth 
— two years after our divorce. Dr. 
Allison has tested him, and Donald 
has the normal 48 chromosomes.” 

“Can’t you accept the verdict of 
nature, Forsythe?” demanded 
Truggles. “If you were born a 
eunuch, you could never repro- 
duce.” 

“While there’s hope, I have the 
responsibility,” said Forsythe slow- 
ly. “If the stream of life is to pro- 
gress, something greater than man 
must arise from him. I know, Trug- 
gles — I know — I am that superior 
thing. And I think back in history 
to the geniuses, the superior men, 
who died without progeny and I 
wonder how many of them were 
tetraploid, as I am, but could not 
pass on their new abilities to the 
world.” 

Truggles shook his head angrily 
and arose. 

“You can’t succeed by flouting 
the social conventions man has built 
up,” he said stiffly. “I’m afraid 
you’ll find that out to your sorrow, 
Forsythe.” 



73 




His mind caressed the gun inside 
his coat pocket. Such a direct solu- 
tion appealed to him. But he re- 
sisted it. There was a better, safer 
way. He turned his back on For- 
sythe and left. 

As he walked past the Allison 
home, and covered half a block to- 
ward town, seething inwardly at 
Forsythe’s stubbornness; a woman 
arose from a sidewalk bench to ac- 
cost him. It was Lois, Forsythe’s 
dark-haired wife to whom he had 
talked while she wept half an hour 
earlier. 

“Why, Mrs. For — Miss Lois!” 
he exclaimed. “What are you doing 
here? Did you escape?” 

“Escape?” she repeated. Her eyes 
were shadowed from weeping. 
“Blan doesn’t keep us prisoners. 
We come and go as we please. It’s 
just that most of us prefer not to go 
out into town.” 

“I can understand that,” he said 
drily. “Can I help you, Miss Lois?” 

“Perhaps I can help myself, by 
helping you. Mr. Truggles, aren’t 
you trying to stop Blan from keep- 
ing more than one wife?” 

“I am, indeed. I expect to seek 
an indictment against him on big- 
amy charges.” 

“You won’t succeed. He’ll just 
sue you for false arrest, and ruin 
you. You don’t think Blan would 
overlook something like that, do 
you? None of the girls would admit 
they lived with him as his wives. I 
wouldn’t either, if it would hurt 
Blan.” 

Truggles was taken aback. After 
a moment, he asked: “What did 
you have in mind?” 

“Nothing. But I thought if I 

74 



could help you persuade him — as 
the wife who’s been with him long- 
est, I’d be the one to stay, wouldn’t 

I?” 

Thinking of an unknown num- 
ber of others who might have been 
sent away previously, Truggles was 
inclined to doubt it. But he would 
not let such an opinion interfere 
with this opportunity. 

“Probably,” he said. “Will you 
help me if I promise to take no 
legal action against Forsythe?” 

“What do you want me to do?” 
she asked. 

“You say you’re free to come and 
go as you please?” 

“Yes.” 

“I just want you to tell the truth 
about what he’s doing, as I’ve 
learned it, at a few meetings of 
good, sympathetic citizens during 
the next few weeks.” 

“I’ll do it if you’re sure it won’t 
hurt Blan in any way,” she said. 

“I’m positive it won’t,” Truggles 
lied. 



HE SOCIAL Standards Pro- 
tective League was a small or- 
ganization, composed largely of 
elderly women and a few men. 
Masefield Truggles had never 
meant for it to serve as anything 
more than a nucleus. Before he lit 
the flame, he spent a week building 
up his tinder pile. 

He announced, by word of mouth 
and through the columns of The 
Clarion , Marston Hill’s small daily 
newspaper, that the Social Stand- 
ards Protective League would hold 
a series of special meetings every 
afternoon for a week. The public 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 





would be welcome, he said, and 
there would be startling revelations 
of vice conditions in Marston Hill. 
Truggles rented the city’s ancient, 
rickety auditorium for the meet- 
ings, and invited Mayor Ben Sands 
to speak at the first one. 

Lois Forsythe sat on the platform 
that first afternoon, but Truggles 
did not call on her. Sands made a 
routine talk, the kind any mayor of 
a small town might, on the con- 
scientiousness of Marston Hill’s 
three-man police force, the lack of 
crime in the town, the recreational 
facilities and educational methods 
being utilized to see that the young 
people did not stray on the wrong 
path. He received polite applause. 

When he had finished, Truggles 
arose and said: 

“Sometimes after talks of this 
kind, we throw our meetings open 
to questions from the audience. In- 
stead, I would like to ask Mayor 
Sands one question. Does he recall 
that I complained to him not long 
ago about the activities of Blan 
Forsythe, and what the tenor of the 
conversation was?” 

“Why, yes,” answered Sands, sur- 
prised. “You accused Blan of prac- 
ticing polygamy. I told you that 
you’d been listening to too much 
gossip, and that Blan was doing 
biological research. I don’t believe 
these good people would be inter- 
ested in the nature of the research.” 

“I do,” answered Truggles, “and 
it will be the subject of tomorrow’s 
meeting. I have investigated these 
experiments, and they are well 
worth hearing about. Thank you, 
Mr. Mayor.” 

Truggles was a past master at 
FAMILY TREE 



building tension. The next day, he 
apologized for changing the pro- 
gram and gave a lecture on polyg- 
amy in human society. Back- 
grounded with considerable re- 
search at the Marston Hill public 
library, he described polygamy in 
Biblical times, in savage communi- 
ties, in China and the Moham- 
medan world and among the early 
Mormons in the United States. He 
told of the social objections to 
polygamy and the progress made in 
eliminating it as a way of life. 

The following day, he described 
Forsythe’s research with tetraploid 
plants — not too accurately, but that 
didn’t matter with this audience — 
and skillfully translated chromo- 
some doubling into human terms 
until his final revelation that For- 
sythe was a tetraploid man left 
them gasping. And, the fourth day, 
he told, with some embroidery, of 
Forsythe’s polygamy. 

During each of these talks, Lois 
sat on the stage. Polygamy was a 
known, routine affair to her. Trug- 
gles was able to word his talks so 
that, to Lois, his revelations ap- 
peared calm and unbiased; but at 
the same time they were insinuat- 
ing and inflammatory to his audi- 
ences, to whom polygamy was some- 
thing strange and monstrous. 

During none of the first four talks 
did he call on Lois. But at the end 
of the fourth, he announced : 

“I have described to you what 
Forsythe told me himself. Perhaps 
you have been wondering who this 
attractive young lady is. She is none 
other than one of Forsythe’s multi- 
ple wives, and tomorrow evening 
you shall hear a description of a 

75 




polygamous household from her 
own lips.” 

The first meeting had contained 
only the members of the small 
group which Truggles himself had 
organized, and two or three visitors 
attracted by the mayor’s presence. 
But such words as “polygamy,” 
“harem,” “strange research,” 
“monstrous plants and people” got 
around, as Truggles intended they 
should. The audience grew by leaps 
and bounds. By the night of the 
final meeting, the old auditorium 
was filled to overflowing; they were 
standing in the aisles. 

Calmly, and yet not without 
some hint of the tragedy she herself 
felt, Lois described the day-to-day 
life of Forsythe’s household; the 
friendship among the wives, their 
jealousies, their hopes and regrets. 
She did not realize that her words, 
like those of Truggles the day be- 
fore, were building anger in the 
breasts of her hearers at something 
they had not experienced and could 
not understand. 

When she had finished, Truggles 
took the stage, and now the calm- 
ness, the factualness, was gone from 
him. 

“You have heard what this poor 
woman told you!” he cried. “You 
have heard how this man, this 
Forsythe, took advantage of her. 
Remember, her sisters are as unfor- 
tunate as she. Shall this lecher, this 
monster, go unpunished?” 

Before he could say more, Lois 
was on her feet. 

“Mr. Truggles, wait!” she ex- 
claimed. “You told me you were 
going to try to get Blan to give up 
polygamy. I wouldn’t have come 

76 



here and helped you if I’d known 
you were going to try to arouse his 
friends against him!” 

“My poor child, it’s too late,” an- 
swered Truggles loudly. “I tried to 
persuade the man to give up his 
life of sin, and his heart was as 
stone. He must feel the lash of just 
retribution!” 

She stared at him, her eyes wid- 
ening in slow realization. Then she 
burst into tears and ran from the 
stage. She fled down the aisle and 
out of the auditorium. 

“Do you see?” cried Truggles to 
his audience. His blue eyes flashed 
and his voice rang like a trumpet. 
“Even now she cannot break his 
devilish hold on her! Think! Are 
your daughters safe from him? Are 
your wives, even? Do you know 
that the wife of his best friend, Dr. 
Allison, admits that her child is the 
child of this man, this monster?” 
For five minutes, he shouted, he 
wept, he shook his fists, he raised 
his hands to heaven. Then, striding 
to the edge of the platform, he de- 
manded in a low, compelling tone: 
“Who will take up the sword of 
righteousness and go with me to 
drive this creature from our midst?” 
For a moment, there was dead 
silence. Then a young man stood 
up in the middle of the auditorium. 
“By God, I will!” he shouted. 
“I reckon I will, too,” called an 
older man near the rear. One by 
one, then all at once, they were on 
their feet, shouting and ‘milling 
around. Truggles leaped from the 
stage and forced his way through 
the crowd to the door. They surged 
out of the auditorium at his heels 
and poured down the middle of the 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




street toward the home of Blan 
Forsythe, yelling. 

With Truggles in the lead, the 
excited citizens swept onto the 
broad lawn in front of the big man- 
sion, spread out over the grass, 
trampling the flower beds. There 
were fifty to a hundred of them. 

Porch lights went on all over the 
neighborhood. From the same di- 
rection from which the crowd had 
come, two figures ran across the 
yards in the dimness and, circling 
the edge of the crowd, came up to 
Truggles. He recognized Phyllis 
Allison and her son, Donald. 

“What is this, Mr. Truggles?” 
she cried, peering into his face. 
“What are all these people doing?” 

“I’m sorry you came here, Mrs. 
Allison,” he answered, shouting to 
make himself heard over the uproar 
of the people around them. “These 
people are determined to right the 
wrong this man has done you.” 

Outside lights from the mansion 
suddenly lit the entire lawn, and 
the mob that stirred restlessly on it. 
A momentary silence feH. Their 
numbers did not seem as great, 
their ranks not so solid, in the glare 
of the lights. 

“Come on, Forsythe!” shouted 
Truggles in a great voice. “Come 
out and face your judges!” 

The front door opened and Al- 
lison stepped out on the railinged 
porch. Truggles, at the front of the 
crowd, was about seventy feet from 
him. 

“What is this?” demanded Al- 
lison. “What are you people doing 
here?” 

“We’ve come for Forsythe,” an- 
swered Truggles, and a murmur 

FAMILY TREE 



from the crowd backed him up. 
“Where is he?” 

“I’m surprised at you, all of you,” 
said Allison. “You people are my 
friends and Blan’s friends. Why, 
you — ” 

He broke off as he caught sight 
of Phyllis and Donald. 

“Phyllis!” he exclaimed. “What 
are you doing here? Take that boy 
home!” 

Obediently, she turned away, but 
Truggles caught her by the arm. 

“Get Forsythe out here!” he 
cried. “Let him face the woman he 
wronged!” 

At that moment, Forsythe him- 
self came out of the door and stood 
at Allison’s side. A wordless cry ran 
through the mob at the sight of the 
tetraploid man’s face, topped with- 
its cap of mole-gray fuzz. 

“I see you’re still taking an ac- 
tive interest in my affairs, Trug- 
gles,” said Forsythe. He did not 
raise his voice, but it carried across 
the lawn. 

“Evil is every man’s business,” 
answered Truggles boldly. “These 
good people are enraged that you 
should flout the laws of society so 
brazenly.” 

“Naturally,” replied Forsythe, 
smiling. “And you enraged them. 
As long as everyone here minded 
his own business, no harm was 
done.” 

“I expected you to take that at- 
titude, Forsythe,” shouted Trug- 
gles. “Have you no sense of respon- 
sibility, no respect for the customs 
that others have established for 
their protection?” 

“Certainly,” said Forsythe, but 
he added, logically: “Would you 

77 




be bound by the customs of a colony 
of mice, if they interfered with your 
pursuit of greater ends?” 

“Listen at him!” cried Truggles, 
turning to the crowd and spreading 
his hands. "'You see what high re- 
gard he has for you, who have be- 
friended him? He scorns you! He 
calls you mice!” 

He turned back to the mansion 
with clenched fists and took a step 
forward. 

“You monster!” he shouted. 
“Even mice can be dangerous!” 

The crowd behind him surged 
forward with a roar. Forsythe’s 
voice rang out above it. 

“Wait!” he cried. “I appeal to 
your reason! I have no higher 
power. I can’t strike you dead, or 
vanish from your sight. All I can 
do is ask you one question. Will you 
destroy me because I violate your 
customs, when I represent the hope 
of your race to become something 
greater?” 

His words fell on deaf ears. The 
crowd inched forward, ugly, dan- 
gerous. 

A figure brushed past Truggles. 
It was Phyllis Allison, and she 
tugged the boy Donald with her. 

“Stop her!” cried Truggles. 
“Don’t let her get in his clutches!” 

Alone, for these words seemed 
only to confuse those near him, 
Truggles ran after Phyllis and the 
boy. But they stopped, halfway to 
the porch, and Truggles reached 
them. He placed his hand on 
Phyllis’ arm and pulled at her com- 
pellingly. 

He was close enough to her to 
hear her words to the boy. 

“Donnie!” she urged anxiously. 

78 



“You remember the game we 
played? Use the Power!” 

The boy looked apprehensively 
toward the porch. 

“Daddy said don’t,” he de- 
murred. 

Dr. Alex Allison stood, his hands 
gripping the rail of the porch, look- 
ing out over the ugly crowd. There 
was no mistaking the moment. At 
any instant, the mob would surge 
over the porch. 

“Blan, I can’t let them kill you 
because I’ve wronged you,” said 
Allison in a clear, agonized voice. 
“Donald is your son!” 

There was a cry from Phyllis and 
she clutched the boy convulsively, 
twisting free of Truggles’ grip. The 
people on the lawn fell silent, their 
upturned faces white in the light, 
waiting, sensing the import of the 
revelation. 

“I told you there was the possi- 
bility that the tetraploid could re- 
produce with the diploid,” said Al- 
lison. “It’s true Donald’s cells don’t 
contain 96 chromosomes — but nei- 
ther do they contain just 48. They 
contain 72 chromosomes — an even 
number, a viable number! Not al- 
ways, but sometimes the hybrid is 
superior to both diploid and tetra- 
ploid. Blan, with all your unex- 
plored qualities, you’re just the 
vehicle of the new race. Donald is 
the superman!” 

“But it’s impossible!” exclaimed 
Forsythe. “I haven’t even seen 
Phyllis since we were divorced.” 

“Did you think the tetraploid, 
the new species, would have the 
same gestation period as man?” 
asked Allison. “The gestation period 
is thirty months. Phyllis was preg- 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




nant when you were divorced, Blan, 
but I loved her and I didn’t let 
either of you know. I wanted her 
for myself.” 

“So that’s why you recommended 
polygamy so enthusiastically,” re- 
marked Forsythe. 

“That’s why I recommended a 
two-year limit on keeping any of 
your wives, and why I made sure 
they were sent far away,” admitted 
Allison. “I couldn’t let you know. 
You have half a dozen sons and 
daughters now, Blan, and Lois is 
going to be a mother.” 

There was happiness in Forsythe’s 
dark face as he looked out over the 
crowd. To see happiness on his face 
cut Truggles’ soul like a knife. 

And all this small talk was losing 
his crowd. The seething emotions 
he had nurtured so carefully were 
simmering down in harmless curi- 
osity aroused by the small private 
drama that had unfolded before 
the people on the lawn. 

“It’s a conspiracy to mislead 
you!” he howled. “If no one else 
will throw the first stone, I will!” 

It was a symbolic gesture, his 
scooping up a harmless clod and 
hurling it to explode against the 
porch as he marched on the man 
he hated. His back to the crowd, 
Truggles feared with a terrible fear 
that it was already too late. He was 
chancing making himself ridiculous. 

But his heart leaped as the voices 
of a few hotheads arose in his sup- 
port behind him, and he felt, rather 
than heard, some of the people 
surge forward. How many? He 
didn’t know, but a few would be 
enough to start the rest again. 

Allison was leaning over the 

FAMILY TREE 



porch rail, his face white, looking 
not at Truggles but past him. 

“Donald!” he cried in a low 
voice that carried intensely across 
the grass. “Do as your mother says! 
I won’t punish you. Use the 
Power!” 

And Truggles faltered and 
stopped in his tracks. He looked 
around him, confused, as some un- 
seen force seemed to take his will 
and disperse it. 

The harsh glare of the lights 
faded in the glow of a greater, 
softer, more glorious illumination. 
A soundless music filled the air, so 
deep and majestic that it was felt, 
rather than heard. Almost, Trug- 
gles expected the sky to open and a 
heavenly choir to appear. 

Around him, he saw the familiar 
things of Marston Hill with new 
eyes. Life coursed through the 
green grass, bade a winter’s fare- 
well from the turning leaves of the 
trees. He felt for the first time that 
he was not a creature alone, but a 
part of all life around him. 

The faces of the people around 
him showed that they, too, felt 
what he felt. They saw beauty in 
the air, in the world. As he looked 
on them, Truggles realized, for the 
first time in the heart of him, that 
their small faults were not vices, 
not innate evil — not even the hatred 
and fear that had been in their 
hearts when they stormed here with 
him was evil. There were only the 
well-meaning flaws that sprang 
from earnest eagerness. 

Even the face of Forsythe, when 
Truggles looked at it, mirrored the 
ecstatic understanding of some- 
thing that he had experienced only 



79 




partially before. And Truggles 
knew that the type of understand- 
ing that had opened up to Forsythe 
was something he himself never 
could comprehend. 

And in the midst of this experi- 
ence that transcended understand- 
ing, the boy Donald took his 
mother’s hand and the two of them 
floated up, into the air, above 
Truggles’ head, and forward to 
alight gently at Forsythe’s side on 
the porch. 

But, amazing as that was, Trug- 
gles recognized it was only a small 
outward manifestation of the 
Power. The Power of the superman 
was what he and all these others 
felt, a weapon greater than fire or 
sword, greater than will or reason. 
Under its influence, no man could 
raise his hand against his brother, 
for he understood . 

The vision, if vision it was, faded, 
and only a crowd of murmuring 
people stood around sheepishly in 
the cold glare of the lights on 
Forsythe’s lawn. 

“Truggles, you’ve won your 
point,” said Forsythe, and there was 
no animosity in his voice. “I don’t 
need to experiment any more. I’m 
leaving Marston Hill with my wife 
and son . .” 

He caught himself and looked at 
Allison. 

“I can’t hold her,” said Allison 
in a low tone. “I won’t try to. I’ll 
give her a divorce.” 

“. With my only wife and 
son,” resumed Forsythe happily. 
“I’m going to find my other chil- 
dren. And I don’t think any of you 
will ever hear of us again.” 

He turned and entered the house 

80 



with Phyllis and Donald. Allison 
followed them, his head bowed. 

Truggles sat in his small, sparse- 
ly-furnished room and fought his 
soul. 

For a long time, the memory of 
what the boy Donald had somehow 
shown the people of Marston Hill 
lingered with him: the conception 
of a world that was all good, all 
beauty, everything right. Truggles 
tried to cling to it, but gradually it 
slipped from him. There was some- 
thing in him that prevented him 
holding it. At last, he still could re- 
member it, but the memory was a 
logical thing, a thing that was in- 
credible to him because it had no 
roots in emotion. 

As that happened, the old tor- 
ment returned ten-fold, as though 
it had battered outside of the 
vision’s barrier fruitlessly until it 
could burst on him with renewed 
vigor. 

Writhing inwardly, twisting his 
hands, Truggles stared unseeing at 
the room about him while he re- 
lived the agony of the past. He 
held* Margaret — how long, how 
many years had it been, since he 
had let himself even think that 
name? — he held her in his arms 
and felt her cool lips against his. 
He talked with her, he felt the 
closeness of something infinitely 
good and right for him. 

He lived again the angry, shout- 
ing interview when she stood with 
the arm of the Brazilian, De Cas- 
tro, around her shoulders and said : 
“I’m sorry, Masefield. I like you 
and for a while I thought it was 
something more. But I’ve found 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




love with a man who’s so far su- 
perior to either of us that I still 
can’t believe he’s mine.” 

“That foreigner?” he shouted 
again, and tears sprang tq his eyes 
as they had then. “You turn me 
down for him? You think I’m in- 
ferior to him?” 

And again he lived through the 
shame of falling on his knees before 
her, turning up his weeping face to 
her, imploring her to no avail. He 
saw on her face and the Brazilian’s 
face the pity, the scorn, before they 
walked out together, leaving him 
to sob alone. 

Truggles beat his hands helpless- 
ly on the arm of the chair. Of all 
the hapless people he had tracked 
down and tossed to the ravening, 
outraged contempt of the public, 
he had wanted most of all to con- 
quer Forsythe. He had wanted to 
see Forsythe cower and whimper, 
beg before they hung him. 

And Forsythe had won. What 
mattered it that he was leaving 
Marston Hill? Truggles had 
thought that would be a victory, to 
make Forsythe run away. But For- 
sythe was not going alone and 
hunted. He was taking with him 



the woman he loved, who reminded 
Truggles of the clean beauty of 
Margaret; the one woman who un- 
derstood him as none of those 
others could. 

And the boy. Was it a defeat to a 
man to know that his son was 
greater than he? Truggles knew it 
was not. A vision rose before him of 
a race of men and women who 
walked among the clouds, who saw 
only beauty in the world and looked 
down with sympathetic pity upon 
the poor creeping humans below. 
The new race, greater than Trug- 
gles could even imagine himself. 

Truggles stirred, and awoke to 
his surroundings, bitterly. He 
would have to leave Marston Hill 
himself. The people would not 
thank him for arousing them 
against Forsythe. From them, he 
could expect only anger, contempt, 
perhaps even . 

There was a sudden rattling be- 
hind him. Truggles jumped to his 
feet, alarmed, fearful, his heart 
beating fast. His apprehensive eyes 
searched the room. 

A paper moved in a corner. It 
was only a mouse. • • •

E VEN WITH modem conven- 
iences, Caesar could never have 
staged such a triumph, and in the 
face of world history-making, he 
wouldn’t have reason to. Olbu’s 
visit to the earth was certainly a 
bigger deal for the archives than 
anything Caesar ever did. 

“No one can say you aren’t a 
good sport,” commended Ralph 
Rodkey of the Interstate Broad- 
casting Network. “You had plenty 
of reason to be annoyed, especially 
when the mob tried to tear your 
clothes off. But, the people meant 
no harm; they just adore you.” 
Olbu had learned English over- 
night and mastered it. He hardly 
had an accent: “I was a little dis- 
turbed, you might say.” 

“Well, our people are hero 
worshippers,” Rodkey explained. 
“And you’re certainly a hero, be- 
ing the first man from off the Earth 



BY RUSS WINTERBOTHAM 




to land on the Earth, you might 
say. And then too, given an oppor- 
tunity to celebrate, an Earthman 
will take full advantage of the 
slightest excuse.” 

“Rather barbaric,” said Olbu. 



“You say you don’t travel in 
space as yet?” 

“No, and you’re the first visitor 
from space we’ve had. You see no 
planets of this solar system are in- 
habited by intelligent forms of 




Illustrated by Ed Emsh 



“But then this is a barbaric planet.” 
“Uh? Oh, yes. Just joking, of 
course. Now we’re about ready for 
our telecast with Cecil Burroughs, 
the greatest commentator in the 
business. You’ll appear with one of 
our leading scientists.” 

“I hope he can understand the 
things I shall talk about.” 

“We may not know much about 
space flight, but we know a lot of 
things; my boy,” said Rodkey. 



life.” 

“You can say that again,” said 
Olbu. 

“With the exception of the 
Earth, of course.” Rodkey laughed. 
“We were very thrilled to have 
someone drop in on us.” 

“How strange!” 

“In fact, many of our people 
figured that Man was unique. They 
thought he couldn’t exist anywhere 
but here.” 



83 





“It would be nice if such were 
the case,” said Olbu. “But I’m 
afraid the galaxy is not so fortu- 
nate. Many planets have men. 
Some are more like men than 
others, if you understand what I 
mean. But they all have his chief 
faults and good points.” 

Rodkey had arranged for the in- 
terview in the Presidential suite of 
the Claremont Hotel and in the 
next room electricians were busy 
setting up the equipment. Presently 
the door opened and a man of 
about 50, clean shaven and slightly 
bald, paused in the doorway. He 
looked at the confusion for a mo- 
ment, hesitated as if he were check- 
ing an impulse to flee, then spotted 
Rodkey through the bedroom door. 

“Dr. Bruber!” exclaimed Rod- 
key. 

Dr. Alymir Bruber beamed, ex- 
tended his hand and strode for- 
ward. 

He tripped over a cable, but 
caught himself on the doorframe 
with nothing worse than a bumped 
shoulder. 

Rodkey pumped his hand en- 
thusiastically. “It’s been a long 
time, Doctor!” he said, slapping 
him on the shoulder. “Remember, 
we met when I interviewed you 
on the nervous electron factor of 
your diatomic equivalent energy 
principle back in ’96.” 

“Oh,” said Bruber. “Yes, I re- 
member you well.” He turned his 
head toward Olbu. One glance 
would have convinced anyone that 
Olbu was from space — or at least 
another planet. He had an unus- 
ually large head, small neck, skinny 
arms and legs and a pot belly. 

84 



Everyone knows that people from 
other planets have all of these 
things. The only thing wrong with 
Olbu was that his eyes were just 
like anyone’s eyes, a little slanted, 
perhaps, but not more so than the 
average oriental, and of course 
Olbu had no feelers extending from 
his forehead. But those things 
weren’t absolutely necessary in a 
man who looked the part, as Olbu 
did. 

“This must be our visitor!” 
Once more Dr. Bruber extended 
his hand and this time he tripped 
over the rug, but Rodkey was 
handy to catch him. 

“My glasses,” explained Dr. 
Bruber. “They’re only bifocals, and 
I have trouble adjusting to middle 
distances.” 

“Olbu,” said Rodkey, “allow 
me to present Dr. Bruber, the 
world’s greatest living scientist.” 

Dr. Bruber laughed nervously 
and shook hands with Olbu. “I’m 
afraid Mr. Rodkey is being extrav- 
agant. Actually I’m not the great- 
est. Only the greatest in my field. 
I’m second greatest in three others 
though.” 

“Dr. Bruber is too modest,” said 
Rodkey. “There’s practically noth- 
ing that he doesn’t know.” 

“No one knows nothing,” said 
Olbu. 

Dr. Bruber blinked as he tried 
to figure that one out. It doubtless 
hinged on a lingual difference to 
start with and so he gave up. 

“Well, gentlemen,” said Rodkey, 
“our broadcast will start in thirty 
minutes. Perhaps we can go over 
briefly what topics we should talk 
upon. You know we don’t want to 

RUSS WINTERBOTHAM 




get into anything too deep for 
our viewers to understand, yet we 
don’t want to be too trivial, you 
know. Give them something inter- 
esting, I always say. Then if we 
have any time left, we might touch 
on some topics that go a little be- 
yond that.” 

“Did you have a nice trip?” 
asked Dr. Bruber. 

“It was beastly,” said Olbu. 
“Thirty-two light years of space 
and not even an interesting 
meteor.” 

“We’re on the verge of making 
an interplanetary flight here on 
Earth,” Dr. Bruber said. “The 
trouble is, no one that wants a 
flight has any money and those 
that have the money don’t care 
about space flight.” 

“You’re probably better off all 
around,” said Olbu. 

“Come now, gentlemen,” said 
Rodkey. “We can do better than 
that. You can cut loose with a few 
scientific terms now and then. It 
gives the interview an authentic 
flavor. Ask Olbu his opinion of the 
quantum jump, Dr. Bruber.” 

Dr. Bruber turned toward the 
director and blinked through his 
heavy glasses. “I’d rather ask our 
distinguished visitor why he came.” 

“Yes, Dr. Bruber. Please do,” 
said Olbu. 

“All right. Why did you come 
here?” 

“We wanted to decide whether 
to wipe out the solar system or 
not.” 

For a moment it was silent in 
the room, except for the sound of 
the electricians outside the door. 

A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE 



“Goddamit,” said an electrician. 
“You can’t use that hookup on the 
Y-circuit. You’ll cut out the mon- 
itors.” 

Ralph Rodkey tiptoed to the 
bedroom door and closed it. 

“Surely you’re joking,” said Dr. 
Bruber. “Quite a sense of humor. 
Ha-Ha.” 

“No, I’m not. We discovered 
there was at least one habitable 
planet here — and where there are 
habitable planets, there are likely 
to be human beings. Human beings 
are dangerous.” 

Rodkey cleared his throat. 
“Gentlemen. Far be it from me to 
interfere in a scientific discussion 
like this, but if I were you I’d try 
another tack. A large number of 
our viewers might not understand 
it.” 

“You think it would be better, 
perhaps, if we killed them all with- 
out warning?” Olbu said, turning 
toward the director. 

“Really, Mr. Olbu,” said Rod- 
key. “You don’t intend to blot us 
out, do you?” 

“That decision is hardly mine to 
make,” said Olbu. “I’ll have to re- 
port to my superiors. If you’re dan- 
gerous, you’ll have to be erased, 
and there’s nothing that can be 
done about it.” 

“Excuse me a moment.” Rodkey 
rose, went to the phone and or- 
dered liquor sent up to the room. 
He hung up the receiver. “I think 
it’s best that we make your stay 
here a pleasant one, Olbu.” 

“If you intend to bribe me, I’m 
afraid you’ll have no success,” said 
Olbu. “I was chosen because I am 
impeccable.” 

85 




“I’m quite sure of it,” said Dr. 
Bruber. “And perhaps there is 
something in your premise that not 
all human beings are desirable. I 
should like to know how Earth is 
making out.” 

Olbu shrugged his shoulders. “So 
far I’ve seen nothing worth sav- 
ing,” he said. “You’re a vain lot. 
You’re trivial. You have no respect 
for the dignity of Man. And your 
worst fault is ambition. I suppose 
you have wars?” 

“Not for a long time. Two or 
three years anyhow,” said Rod- 
key. 

“How long is a year? Ah yes, I 
forgot. It is the period of the 
planet on its journey around the 
sun. And how long does that take? 
One year. The usual nonsensical 
way you have of defining things. 
You don’t even know how to meas- 
ure time.” 

“How very interesting!” ex- 
claimed Dr. Bruber. “Actually it 
never occurred to me that there 
might be an absolute method of 
measuring time. What is it?” 

“It’s the Mpto. Forty- three and 
a third Mptos make an Anup, and 
twelve million Anups make a 
Zorex. It’s a lot simpler than sec- 
onds, minutes, hours, days, weeks 
and so on.” 

“Yes, I see,” said Dr. Bruber. 
“But getting back to our topic. 
Just what should we have that 
would make us worth saving?” 
“Stability,” said Olbu. “Earth- 
men lack stability.” 

“Don’t you think you should talk 
more about your trip?” Rodkey 
asked. “How did Saturn look when 
you passed it?” 

86 



“Saturn wasn’t in the right place 
to be seen at all,” Dr. Bruber said. 
“But you did see Pluto. How did it 
look?” 

“There was nothing about it and 
it looked awful,” said Olbu. 

“I hate to be injecting my own 
personal ideas into this conversa- 
tion,” said Rodkey, “because after 
all, I know nothing about science. 
But don’t you suppose it would 
please our viewers if we talked 
more about space flight than about 
the destruction of the human 
race?” 

“You see,” said Olbu to Dr. 
Bruber. “That’s what I mean. No 
stability.” 

“After all, the poor man doesn’t 
want to lose his job,” Bruber ex- 
plained. “I’d say that was a de- 
sire to be stable.” 

“If he’s going to be dead, which 
he will be when I get word from 
my superiors, he’ll lose his job 
whether he wants to or not,” said 
Olbu. 

“I’ll go along with a joke as well 
as anyone,” said Rodkey, “but 
gentlemen, we’ve only got twelve 
minutes till we go on the air. Now 
let’s cut out this nonsense about 
destroying Earth and talk about 
something pleasant.” 

“Certainly,” said Dr. Bruber. 
“What planet did you come from?” 

“Xvik,” said Olbu. “It’s the 
fourth planet of a star you call 
GC1242.” 

“Good old GC1242!” said Dr. 
Bruber. 

“Oh, you know that star?” 

“Yes, it’s a minor variable loosely 
attached to Lyra.” 

“There’s no tiling loose about my 

RUSS WINTERBOTHAM 




star/’ said Olbu. 

Tm sure Dr. Bruber didn’t 
mean it that way,” said Rodkey 
hastily. He looked nervously at Dr. 
Bruber. “Did you, doctor?” 

“That’s one of the things I don’t 
know,” he said, wiping his glasses 
on his handkerchief. “Tell me, 
Olbu, if you should decide we 
aren’t worth saving, how would 
you communicate with your su- 
periors, considering they’re 32 light 
years away. Wouldn’t it take 64 
years — thirty-two going and thirty- 
two coming — to get a message 
through?” 

“Oh, no! I communicate by in- 
stantaneous telepathy,” said Olbu. 
“It’s much faster than energy 
forms of communication.” 

. “I wish you’d talk about some- 
thing else,” said Rodkey. “Only 
ten minutes to go.” 

Dr. Bruber disregarded the re- 
quest. “I don’t know why people 
on a planet 32 light years away 
should consider Earth dangerous.” 

“Oh Earth isn’t. It’s only the 
people on it,” said Olbu. 

“How do you know about the 
people?” 

“We have a method of enlarging 
telescopic photos to bring out every 
detail. We know all about Man, 
we’ve watched you from the days 
when your ancestors lived in 
caves.” 

“Goodness! You know more 
about us than we know ourselves.” 

“Why don’t you tell our viewers 
about that !” exclaimed Rodkey. 

“Yes,” went on Olbu, who also 
seemed to have forgotten the ex- 
istence of Rodkey, “we saw your 
ancestors fight with sticks and 

A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE 



stones. We saw them use spears, 
then gunpowder. Then we saw the 
atom bomb and the Council de- 
cided to send me to see if anything 
could be salvaged.” 

“But the bomb was 200 years 
ago,” said Dr. Bruber. 

“Twelve Zorax,” corrected Olbu. 
“I’ve been on the way here for 
twelve Zorax — or if you will — 
thirty-two light years, two hundred 
time years.” 

“Surely the atom bomb can’t 
affect your existence when we don’t 
even have space flight,” said Dr. 
Bruber. 

“My race has developed a type 
of logic that can look into the 
future,” said Olbu. “We know that 
certain patterns develop from past 
events. In your case, you’ll follow 
the Atom bomb with the Hydrogen 
bomb, and the Hydrogen bomb 
with the Cobalt bomb — ” 

“We have them both.” 

“Ah! You see. Our logical fore- 
sight is infallible,” said Olbu. “Next 
you’ll wipe out nations, when only 
one is left, you’ll fight neighboring 
planets. Since you haven’t any in- 
habited near neighbors, you’ll have 
to invade Alpha Centauri. After 
that you’ll battle with other stars, 
until you’ve conquered the cluster, 
then the galaxy, finally the universe. 
It’s a very unstable state of affairs.” 
Slowly Dr. Bruber nodded. 
“You’re right. I never realized 
where science was taking us. You 
have something ready to wipe us 
out with?” 

“Yes,” said Olbu. “Just beyond 
the moon, circling the Earth and 
the moon as a satellite, is a missile 
which I can bring here by in- 

87 




stantaneous telepathy, as soon as 
I have my orders from my super- 
ior.” 

“I trust you’ll postpone the fate- 
ful message until after our tele- 
cast?” 

Olbu smiled graciously. “A dy- 
ing man is usually granted his last 
request.” 

“Gentlemen,” said Rodkey, wip- 
ing his brow with a damp handker- 
chief, “they’re waiting for us in the 
next room. We’re on in a minute.” 
He opened the door, allowed Olbu 
to pass through first, and then 
whispered to Dr. Bruber. “I guess 
my job doesn’t matter now. At least 
we’ll scoop the other networks on 
the end of the world.” 

“Tish, tosh, old man,” said Dr. 
Bruber. “Your job’s safe and so 
is the world. But if I should re- 
sort to murder in the next fifteen 
minutes, I hope you’ll testify in my 
behalf.” 



D R. BRUBER walked through 
the door, tripped over a cable 
and sprawled in front of the tele- 
vision cameras. Rodkey helped 
him to his feet and steered him to a 
seat to the left of the distinguished 
news commentator, Cecil Bur- 
roughs. On the right of the com- 
mentator sat Olbu, bobbing his 
huge head and smiling. 

Rodkey barely got out of camera 
range in time to give the signal. 

Burroughs gave the commercial, 
which had nothing to do with in- 
terplanetary flight, or anything 
else of interest. “NOW, ladies and 
gentlemen,” said Burroughs, “our

two distinguished scientists have a 
great deal to tell us about two 
widely separated points in the uni- 
verse.” 

Dr. Bruber smiled into the cam- 
era. “Just before we went on the 
air, Mr. Burroughs,” he said, “Am- 
bassador Olbu and I had an inter- 
esting discussion about the merits 
of Earth. He contends that it is 
unstable — ” 

“You are twisting my words 
around, doctor,” interpolated Olbu. 
“I made it clear that it was not 
the planet itself, but the people 
who are objectionable.” 

“The people spoil the planet?” 
“In a sense. The people are dan- 
gerous, the planet is not.” 

“Would it be possible for a 
planet to spoil the people?” 

Olbu seemed to digest the words 
in his mind before he spoke: “That 
is a rather weak effort to shift the 
blame from the shoulders of those 
responsible for a sad state of affairs, 
doctor. You are trying to say there 
is something in the air, or the water, 
that makes Earthmen what they 
are. 

“No, I was hinting that there 
might be something wrong with 
your planet, Mr. Olbu.” 

“Nonsense! Nothing is wrong 
with my planet. My people would 
not be affected even if the air and 
water were bad. We, the children 
of Xvik, are the highest expression 
of the human race.” 

“It’s easy to see that,” said Dr. 
Bruber. “You were pointing out 
to me that Earth’s pattern of ex- 
istence doesn’t offer much hope 
for the future.” 

“That is right,” said Olbu. 

RUSS WINTERBOTHAM 




“Earth’s future is not much to look 
forward to.” 

“But the planet is worth sav- 
ing?” 

“Definitely.” 

“Yet the people are a part of the 
planet.” 

“You should study logic, Dr. 
Bruber. You’re trying to make me 
say things that are not logical.” 

“Okay, let’s forget logic and 
look at what Earth is likely to do 
if it follows its ‘natural’ trend. You 
say it will destroy itself.” 

“If someone else doesn’t do it 
first,” said Olbu. “It will continue 
to have wars till it exhausts all op- 
portunities for it on the planet. 
Then it will war in the skies, with 
other planets, with other stars, fi- 
nally with other galaxies. Man has 
a thirst for power, and that thirst is 
never satisfied. On the other hand, 
knowledge leads to contentment. 
If the Earth should seek knowl- 
edge, it would forget war.” 

“Perhaps war is necessary for 
survival,” suggested Dr. Bruber. 

“War is seldom fought for sur- 
vival. It is a result of a struggle for 
supremacy. And, might I ask, su- 
premacy of what? After you’ve con- 
quered all the galaxies, what do 
you have?” 

“Olbu seems to have a point 
there,” said Burroughs. “It is now 
time for a brief message from our 
sponsor.” 

The message had nothing to do 
with war, or knowledge. 

“Now, Olbu,” began Burroughs, 
“we were talking about wars, 
knowledge, power and survival. Do 
you have anything else to add?” 

“Only that Earth has brought 

A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE 



this on itself,” said Olbu. 

“I don’t quite understand — ” 
Cecil Burroughs wrinkled his mas- 
sive brow. 

“What our distinguished visitor 
is trying to say,” said Dr. Bruber, 
“is that a planet is only as stable 
as its people. And a star system is 
only as stable as its planets. Isn’t 
that it Ambassador?” 

“You have a round-about 
method of stating nothing at all,” 
said Olbu. “What I’m trying to tell 
you is that sometimes worlds must 
come to an end.” 

“Exactly,” said Dr. Bruber. “I’ve 
made a study of GC1242 for 
many years and I’m quite familiar 
with it. This star, as many scien- 
tists know, became a super nova 
about fifteen years ago.” 

“What?” Olbu’s eyes grew less 
slanting and more round. 

“It was an unstable star,” said 
Dr. Bruber. “The Earth, with all 
its faults, is stable. It may be young, 
impulsive, inclined to play with 
fire — atomic fire no less — but it 
will grow up some day.” 

“My star, my planet — gone?” 
“You haven’t been in contact 
with your home base since you 
arrived?” Dr. Bruber asked. 

“I was not supposed to contact 
my base,” said Olbu, “until — ” He 
stopped abruptly, and those with 
him were aware of the fact that he 
was using his mental powers to call 
his superiors. — The lengthening 
silence seemed to give proof to 
Bruber’s words. 

“Since you have no world to go 
to,” interrupted the Dr. gently, “I 
hope you’ll be our guest. Perhaps

Propaganda-wise, Newsear 
was a wonderful gadget. 
And a sinister one! 

THOUGHT 

FOR 

TODAY 

BY HENRY SLESAR 



T HE MAN in the swivel chair 
seemed • amused at Danton’s 
wide-eyed incredulity. 

“Let me get this straight,” Dan- 
ton said, tapping the sharp corner 
of the official envelope against the 
desk. “You mean I went through 
nine months of blistering basic for 
this?” The flush on his hard young 
face ended ludicrously at the hair- 
line of his shaven head. 

“That’s right,” the Newsear di- 
rector smiled. 

“Look. I took everything those 
OCS torture-hounds could throw 
at me. I walked through a 19.7 ra- 
dioactive field. I pushed an atom 
tank halfway across Texas. You 
mean the Army is going to take all 
that training and — and dump it 
into a desk job?” 

The man pointed. “You read the 
orders.” 

“But it’s crazy!” He looked down 
at the gray-green, metal-free uni- 
form, as if to reassure himself of his 
status. “I’m a trained atom tanker 
— an officer.” 

He glared at the small, owlishly- 
smiling man, whose short legs bare- 
ly touched the floor beneath the 
desk. 

“Angry, lieutenant?” The Direc- 
tor’s name was Forbes. “Angry?” 
Forbes said. “Or relieved?” 

Mel Danton turned his head 
away, stung by the sharp truth. 
“What’s the assignment?” 

“That will develop later. First we 
want to acquaint you with News- 
ear, so you’ll better understand its 
strategic importance. You see, this 
war has many battlefields. We con- 
sider Newsear as important as any 
other — and in some ways, even 



90 




more trying.” 

Danton snorted. 

“I know that’s hard to believe. 
But Newsear operates directly un- 
der the office of the War Depart- 
ment. Don’t be fooled by the ci- 
vilian atmosphere. News dissemina- 
tion has military importance. We’re 
a government agency now.” 

“Yeah? Which government?” 
The smooth voice crackled. “The 
government that put you in uni- 
form. The Central Federal Gov- 



“You can now. We’ve knocked 
the price down to practically noth- 
ing. But as a member of Newsear, 
you’re entitled to a complimentary 
unit. Here.” He opened a drawer 
arid removed a small clear-plastic 
envelope. He tore it open, removed 
another earfunnel, and extended it 
towards the man in uniform. 

“Put it in,” Forbes coaxed. “It’s 
indispensable these days. Nobody 
ever knows the score without News- 
ear.” He put a hand to his mouth

emment. 



and smiled behind it. “Go 
on, put it in. It’s clean.” 
Danton hesitated. Then 
\ he slipped the gadget into 

l his left ear.

Forbes’ pinched face relaxed, and 
he reached into his left ear and re- 
moved the tiny, colorless funnel 
and held it up between two fingers. 

“This little gizmo,” he grinned, 
“is one of the nation’s most potent 
weapons. Don’t ever underestimate 
that fact.” 

Danton stared at it. 

“Ever use one?” 

The lieutenant shook his head. 
“No. I never could afford it.”

Danton yanked the earpiece out. 
“How do you shut the damned 
thing off?” 

“That’s one way,” Forbes admit- 
ted. “But most citizens prefer to 
keep tuned. We only broadcast on 
the average of three hours a day. 
This happens to be a busy hour.” 



91 




Danton examined the object 
curiously. “It’s a lot better than the 
gadgets we used in basic. For field 
instructions.” 

“That’s part of our job, too. 
We’re manufacturers as well as 
broadcasters. Newsear turns out 
something like five thousand ear- 
pieces a day for the military. Lim- 
ited-frequency types. It’s only re- 
cently that we’ve developed ade- 
quate subminiaturization tech- 
niques to produce the unit you’re 
holding.” 

“I can see its military impor- 
tance.” Danton, no longer so sure of 
himself, rubbed a hand over his 
head where the thick blond hair 
once grew. “But as far as civilian 
importance — ” 

“The Government doesn’t agree 
with you,” the Director said. 
“Newsear is virtually the only 
method left for informing the 
public. The radio-TV blackout 
took care of that. How else can we 
reach the people?” He shrugged, 
as if the argument was self-evident. 

He leaned forward, and his small 
features changed as if the light had 
shifted on his face. “And there’s 
still another reason,” he said mys- 
teriously. 

“What’s that?” 

“Ah,” the Director said. He 
walked out from behind the desk 
and stumped forward towards the 
door. Danton hadn’t noticed the 
artificial legs before. “That will all 
be clear to you in due course.” 

He opened the door. “Sorry we 
don’t have a free office at the mo- 
ment. You’ll have to share one with 
somebody else.” His eyes twinkled. 
“You won’t mind too much. Your 



companion will be a rather charm- 
ing young lady.” 

“But what am I supposed to do 
here?” 

Forbes blinked. “You have elec- 
tronics training?” 

“Some.” 

“You understand sonic prob- 
lems?” 

“That’s a million years ago — ” 

“Ah. You’re modest. We are in 
possession of both your military 
and academic records. We have 
reason to believe that you were a 
remarkably capable student.” 

“That’s not true. I was only an 
average student.” Danton looked 
down the hallway. “What charm- 
ing voung lady?” 

“Selena McKay is her name. 
She’s been with Newsear almost 
three years. A very clever young 
girl. Come — I’ll introduce you.” 

They walked down the barren 
hallway, with its dull lead-shielded 
walls. The Director’s progress was 
slow and stilted, and his face re- 
flected the effort. By the time they 
reached the small, two-desk office 
at the end of the corridor, he was 
puffing, and his face was moist. 

The girl, with plainly-cut black 
hair dramatically framing a white 
face, looked up from her desk and 
greeted him. 

“Welcome to Newsear,” Selena 
McKay said. 

“Glad to meet you.” Danton 
shook her hand, while the Director 
beamed. 

“It’s all right for today,” the girl 
said, with a fixed half-smile. “But 
after this — don’t ever wear that 
uniform in this office. Ever. Under- 
stand?”

HENRY SLESAR 




Danton turned a bewildered look 
at Forbes. The Director lifted his 
narrow shoulders. “It’s purely op- 
tional, of course. But Miss McKay 
has an allergy to gray-green. It 
would only be common cour- 
tesy . .” 

The lieutenant looked back at 
the girl. Her bold black eyes were 
staring at the front of his tunic 
with such loathing that he uncon- 
sciously recoiled. 

“All right,” he mumbled. 

The Director had been correct. 
She was a lovely girl; but the left 
side of her face was paralyzed. 

W HEN HE reported to the 
Newsear building the next 
morning, Mel Danton wore mufti. 
It was the first time in almost a 
year, and the tweedy stuff caused 
his lean, tough body to itch. He 
squirmed with every step, and when 
he entered the office he shared with 
Selena McKay, he whipped off the 
jacket and flung it onto a hook. 

There was a murmur of quiet, 
professional activity throughout the 
four-story building. Men of widely 
disparate age were moving swiftly 
and noiselessly through the corri- 
dors. There were radiation detec- 
tion barriers on every outside en- 
trance, necessitating a patience- 
trying wait for employees of the 
news center. The security precau- 
tions were even more elaborate 
than the Army’s. 

Danton had done little on his 
first day. Mostly, he had listened 
to Selena’s dry analysis of the oper- 
ational importance of Newsear,^ a 
service she performed for him 

THOUGHT FOR TODAY 



without interruption of her regular 
duties. The extent of his labor was 
to sharpen half a dozen pencils for 
her, the points of which she had 
promptly destroyed with her heavy- 
handed scrawls on sheets of ruled 
yellow paper. 

When she appeared this morn- 
ing, she noted the tweed jacket on 
the hook and said: “Well. That’s 
much better. “Her smile was 
strange and a trifle eerie; a half- 
smile that warmed just one side of 
her lovely face. The effect was odd, 
and yet, somehow, still attractive. 

“I think you can do more than 
Sharpen pencils today. I think the 
fifty-cent tour is in order. All right 
with you?” 

“Fine.” 

“I’ll just clean up the desk a bit. 
Then we’ll have a look at News- 
ear.” 

When they left the office, he fol- 
lowed at a respectful distance. Her 
heels clicked along the corridors, 
and she flung open doors with the 
casual air of confidence. 

One of the doors led to a chart 
room. 

“This is Central Intelligence,” 
she told Danton briskly. “We get 
our reports directly from the mili- 
tary on troop movements and en- 
emy actions all over the world — all 
filtered through a sort of double 
censorship. The Government’s, and 
our own. Only the events consid- 
ered of pertinent importance to the 
citizenry ever go into their receiv- 
ers. Radiation counts in local areas 
are reported in another room; 
that’s an important service, of 
course.” 

“Impressive,” Danton grunted, 

93 




watching the men and women 
moving efficiently between the gi- 
gantic wall charts and the chatter- 
ing teletypes. “It’s not easy to make 
sense out of this war.” 

“That’s our biggest problem, of 
course. The distinctions between 
Enemy and Ally become increasing- 
ly difficult. The picture seems to 
change hourly; our staff of politi- 
cal analysts are probably the larg- 
est single group at Newsear. Come 
along.” 

The next exhibit was a labora- 
tory. 

“It’s only a segment of our re- 
search organization,” Selena said. 
“This happens to be our Sonar 
unit; there are some fifteen others. 
We’re constantly seeking to im- 
prove the technical side of our serv- 
ice. The goal, of course, is perfec- 
tion in Mass-Personal communica- 
tions, striving for a single, fool- 
proof link between every individual 
on Our Side.” 

“You’ve done a remarkable job.” 

She grimaced. “Far from perfect. 
You said it yourself yesterday. The 
military units presently in the field 
are sub-standard, clumsy, outdated. 
The civilian population is already 
equipped with subminiaturized 
funnels. But it will take months be- 
fore their limited frequency equip- 
ment reaches the fighting men. And 
there are other problems . 

“This is the broadcasting section. 
Probably the least complex section 
of our activities.” She glanced up at 
the flashing red sign over the door. 
“Sorry, no admittance for the mo- 
ment. We’ll come back some other 
time.” 

“Do you have an earpiece? 



Mine’s in the office.” 

She fumbled in her pocket. 
“Sure. Want to listen?” 

“If you don’t mind.” 

He took the small funnel in his 
hand and placed it within his ear. 
He heard: 

“. Operation Icecube under 
attack . Alaskan patrols report 
enemy bombers sighted north-north 
east of . 

He flipped the gadget back into 
his palm. 

“The second floor is hundred- 
percent research,” Selena said. 
“The third floor is a sort of hodge- 
podge of executive offices, includ- 
ing our political smart boys ; I won’t 
bother taking you there. The fourth 
floor — ” Her face changed. “Ad- 
ministrative. I guess.” 

“You guess?” 

The girl shrugged. “I’ve never 
been to Four. I only understand 
that it’s administrative. Only what 
that means exactly . 

Danton grinned. “A Bluebeard 
floor, eh? Sounds interesting.” 
“Don’t get ideas, lieutenant. The 
floor is restricted.” 

Back in their office, Danton 
broke a sudden depressed silence 
and asked: 

“But why am I here?” 

Selena looked up. “I haven’t the 
faintest idea. Don’t you know?” 
“No! I studied electronics, sure. 
But I left college a year before 
graduation, to join up. And I 
wasn’t such a hot pupil, either. 
There were a hundred guys with 
more on the ball than I had. Why 
aren’t they here?” 

“I wouldn’t know.” 

Tentatively, Danton said: “And 

HENRY SLESAR

how about you? What brings you 
to Newsear?” 

“Ability/’ she snapped. “I’m a 
psychologist. One of the best.” 



D irector forbes sent for 

him in the afternoon. 
“Recognize these?” There was a 
folder in his hand, and he was spill- 
ing out papers. 

“Looks familiar,” the lieutenant 
grunted. “My service records.” 
“That’s right. I understand that 
you made quite a mark in the men- 
tal energy tests.” 

“So they tell me. Frankly, I 
never knew what the hell they were 
all about.” 

“Few people do. But confiden- 
tially, the Army — and Newsear, I 
might add — consider it one of the 
most crucial tests in the entire ex- 
amination. Even more important 
than psych ratings, or the standard 
Binet foolishness. They indicate 
something very important in this 
crazy world of ours — the ability of 
concentration.” 

Danton licked his lips. “If you’re 
expecting some electronic miracle 
out of me, you’re going to be sadly 
disappointed.” 

The Director looked surprised. 
“I’m no psychologist, either. And 
no political analyst. I’m as confused 
as anybody as to who’s fighting 
who. Maybe more than most.” 
“How about broadcasting?” the 
Director smiled. 

“What?” 

“We always need broadcasters, 
you know.” 

Danton swore. “You mean you 
want me for my dulcet tones? You 

THOUGHT FOR TODAY 



must be kidding.” 

“Maybe not.” The Director stood 
up. “But we’ll talk about that 
later.” He snapped the switch on 
an intercom. “Harris. I’ll be out of 
the office for an hour. Anything 
comes up, you can reach me on 
Four.” 

He circled the desk and opened 
the door. Danton hesitated. 

“What’s on the fourth floor?” 

“My dear young man.” The Di- 
rector chuckled and prodded him 
outside. “You’re in too much of a 
hurry to learn everything.” 

A month went by, and Mel Dan- 
ton became wise in the ways of 
Newsear. 

Selena McKay was his mentor. 
Her knowledge of the broadcasting 
system was nothing short of ency- 
clopedic. Her appreciation of the 
problems of war reporting was 
equally great. Her technical under- 
standing was easily on par with his 
own college level. 

After a while, Danton was com- 
fortably ensconced in the seeming- 
ly unhectic routine of the Newsear 
employees, performing odd jobs for 
the laboratories and the reporters, 
and even — one nervous afternoon — 
sitting in as broadcaster of News- 
ear’s end product: the news itself. 

“Never again,” he told Selena, 
after the chore was done. “I just 
don’t have the voice.” 

“You did all right,” she said 
grudgingly. 

He was getting to like her more 
and more. But one thing bothered 
him. Since her first day. Selena Mc- 
Kay had stopped smiling. 

At the end of Mel Danton’s first 

95 




month in the new assignment, the 
Frozen People began to appear. 

He heard the story on his own 
Newsear, and only remarked it be- 
cause of its incongruity in a broad- 
cast filled with troop actions and 
bombardments and truce talks. 

The first Frozen man had ap- 
peared in Scranton, Pennsylvania. 
He was sixty-seven — twelve years 
above draft age — and he was dis- 
covered in the middle of an inter- 
section, a hazard to traffic. He was 
removed to a local medical station, 
and diagnosed simply as a mental 
case — a catatonic. 

Then three other cataleptics ap- 
peared in various districts, “froz- 
en” people who had stopped in the 
midst of everyday activities, as if 
some inner motor had ceased to 
function. 

The incidence became wide- 
spread. On the date of the Newsear 
broadcast, the announcer registered 
the approximate total of catatonic 
victims at a hundred and eighty. 

“ Government health authorities,” 
the voice said in his ear, <( are in- 
vestigating the possibility that these 
outbreaks are the result of some 
new enemy weapon . ." 

Danton spoke to Selena about 
the news. 

She replied coldly. “Frankly, I 
don’t believe there’s any sort of 
secret weapon involved. I think it’s 
the state of the world. These people 
are retreating from an almost un- 
bearable situation.” 

She returned to her work, but 
soon looked up again. 

“As a matter of fact— this is 
strictly confidential — but the total 
we heard is a slight understatement. 

96 



The smart boys are trying to deter- 
mine its relative importance as a 
news story, so we’re waiting to re- 
lease the complete facts.” 

“You mean there are more of 
them?” 

“Many more. Nobody has an ac- 
curate count, of course. But the in- 
dications are that there are some 
two thousand . .” 

Danton swallowed hard. “Two 
thousand catatonics?” 

“At least,” the girl said grimly. 
“People seem to be freezing up all 
over the country. We don’t have 
word of any cases in the services. 
That’s why I can’t believe it’s any 
enemy weapon. Isn’t that sensible?” 
“You’d think so.” 

“Well, it’s not our concern.” 
“No,” Danton said musingly. 



T HREE WEEKS after that, 
some sixteen thousand Frozen 
People had been officially tabu- 
lated, and Mel Danton was sum- 
moned again into the office of 
Newsear Director Forbes. 

“Okay, Mel,” he said cheerfully. 
“We’re going to Four. I think 
you’ve had enough of the prelimi- 
naries. Now it’s time for the main 
event.” 

He followed Forbes down the 
long corridor, and into the eleva- 
tors. When the doors slid open, 
Danton had his first glimpse of the 
Bluebeard floor of the Newsear 
building. 

It looked exactly like the others. 
They entered an office which was 
bare except for a conference table 
with six wide armchairs. Forbes 
flopped into one, and invited the 

HENRY SLESAR 




lieutenant to sit down. He offered 
him a cigarette, normally forbidden 
on the lower floors. 

They smoked in silence, until the 
door was opened and two men, 
strangers to the officer, entered the 
room. Forbes introduced them cas- 
ually as Kirsch and Douglas, mem- 
bers of something called the “ad- 
ministrative Board.” Kirsch was a 
heavy-set man with a clumsy man- 
ner. Douglas was tall, bony-thin, 
with a weary distinguished face and 
voice. 

“Ah,” Kirsch said. “This is the 
man, hah?” 

“Perhaps,” Forbes smiled. 

“How much do you know about 
this?” Douglas’s fingers rapped the 
table. “I mean, about this side of 
Newsear?” 

“Not a thing,” Danton said 
frankly. “I only know the lower 
level. Is there something else?” 

Kirsch made a grating noise in 
his throat. Douglas looked sharply 
at the Director, as if displeased. 

“Orientation is a luxury,” 
Douglas said icily. “We need a new 
man, and we need him in a hurry. 
Standish is — ” He paused, and 
frowned. “Well, you know about 
Standish.” 

“Who?” Danton said. 

“A broadcaster,” Forbes an- 
swered hurriedly. “One whose cap- 
abilities we overestimated. We need 
a replacement as soon as we can 
find one. We were considering, per- 
haps, that your own mental energy 
record . .” He trailed off, and 
puffed on his cigarette. 

“Do you have a Newsear?” the 
thin man said. 

Danton removed it from his ear. 



Douglas took it, examined it with 
something like contempt, and sent 
it skidding along the slippery sur- 
face of the table. It rolled onto the 
floor with a tiny clatter. Danton 
looked surprised. 

“Kirsch,” the thin man said 
crisply. “Give me a dirty one.” 

The other man reached into his 
pocket and handed his partner a 
Newsear apparently identical with 
the first. 

“Slip this on,” Douglas said. “I’ll 
give you a practical demonstration. 
That’s worth more than talk.” 

“What do you mean a ‘dirty’ 
one?” The lieutenant held the thing 
suspiciously. 

“It’s just a word,” Douglas an- 
swered. “We call the regular News- 
ear ‘clean’. It was only natural that 
we call — these — dirty. Put it in.” 

Danton followed orders. 

“We’ll leave you alone for an 
hour,” the thin man said. “Don’t, 
under any circumstances, remove 
the Newsear. Do you understand?” 

“Look — I think you ought to tell 
me — 

“I’ll tell you nothing more!” 
Douglas stood up, his face dark- 
ening. “This is an order, lieutenant. 
And if you don’t like taking orders 
from civilians, rest easy. I hold the 
rank of Colonel.” 

Danton slumped in his chair. 
“Yes, sir.” 

They left the room without an- 
other display of disagreement. 

Danton felt foolish. 

The Newsear was silent. 

He got up from the chair and 
paced the room. At one point, he 
rattled the knob of the conference 
room door, and, as he expected, 

97 



THOUGHT FOR TODAY 




found it locked. 

The Director had left his ciga- 
rettes on the table. He smoked an- 
other one. 

He studied the room. The walls 
were cork-lined, the floor bare and 
hard, the table of sturdy oak. The 
room was windowless. It couldn’t 
have been more than thirty feet by 
twenty. 

Yet he knew he was being 
watched. 

He whirled, suddenly tense. 

“Sniper!” he whispered. 

He circled the table cautiously. 

“Sniper!” he shouted. 

He ducked beneath the table, 
trembling. 

If he only had a gun 

He crawled on hands and knees, 
protected by the overhang, until his 
fingers touched the feet of a chair. 

“Kill the dirty snipers,” he 
breathed. 

He skittered out of cover, drag- 
ging the chair with him. 

“Where are you?” he screamed. 

He tried to raise it over his head. 
It was too heavy, and crashed back 
to the floor. Without this makeshift 
weapon, he felt unprotected and 
afraid. He dived back beneath the 
shelter of the conference table. 

That was how they found him, 
ten minutes later. 

It was Kirsch who took the 
“dirty” Newsear out, and mur- 
mured something sympathetic. 
Forbes helped him into a chair, 
while Douglas watched them dis- 
passionately. 

Then Douglas said: “Well? 

What happened to you?” 

“I don’t know.” He was still 
trembling. “I thought there were 

98 



snipers — ” He looked wildly around 
the small room. “Snipers. In here . 
I wanted to kill them — ” 

“Mr. Kirsch,” Douglas said. 
“Read the order of the day.” 

The heavy-set man sighed and 
reached into his pocket. He with- 
drew a folded sheet of paper, and 
squinted to read the words. 

“Enemy snipers are everywhere” 
he read. “Kill them all . ." 

“I don’t understand.” 

Douglas smiled for the first time. 
“This is our Newsear broadcast 
for today,” he said. “The one you 
can’t hear with your ears. Only your 
mind.” 



A T FOUR o’clock, Mel Danton 
went to the first floor to collect 
his gear, and more importantly, to 
say goodbye to Selena McKay. 

The office was empty. 

The man in the next cubicle, a 
whispy fellow with white hair and 
an apologetic manner, said: “She’s 
gone for the day. Some trouble at 
home, I think.” 

“Do you know her number?” 
“No. You might try registry.” 
“Thanks,” Danton said. Registry 
obliged. He dialed Selena’s tele- 
phone, and was forced to wait the 
usual five minutes before the call 
could be completed. 

“Hello?” 

“Selena? It’s Mel. Listen, 1 came 
down to see you this afternoon. To 
say goodbye ...” 

“Yes.” Her voice was dreamy. 
“Yes, of course . .” 

“I’m going to Four,” he said 
tightly. “I don’t quite understand 
it — but that’s what they want.” 

HENRY SLESAR 




“I understand.” 

“Selena — is something wrong?” 
“What?” 

“I hear you have some trouble at 
home. Nothing serious?” 

“Yes. Yes,” Selena said. “Fairly 
serious. My mother — ” 

“Is she ill?” 

“Frozen,” the girl said faintly. 
“Catatonic. My mother . .” 

“Oh, Lord!” Danton groaned. 
“Selena, I’m sorry.” 

“She doesn’t know me.” Her 
voice was quivering dangerously. 
“She doesn’t know me, Mel — ” 
“Look, Selena. Could I come 
over? Would you mind that?” 
“Law of averages,” the girl re- 
plied, her voice sing-song. “It’s only 
the law of averages, Mel. A thou- 
sand a day . Why not my moth- 
er?” She laughed abruptly, and the 
sound chilled him. 

“Selena, where do you live?” 
“De Kruif,” Selena said, almost 
casually. “Seventh Street and De 
Kruif. Why do you want to come? 
She doesn’t even know me, Mel — ” 
“I’ll be there in fifteen minutes. 
Selena? Did you hear me?” 

He slammed down the receiver, 
grabbed his coat, and left the 
Newsear building on the run. 

The address was a semi-ruin, 
stripped of electrical power. Dan- 
ton ran past the useless elevator, 
and up the stairs to Selena’s fifth- 
floor apartment. 

He found her sitting cross-legged 
on the floor, weeping into her lap, 
the eternal picture of woman in 
grief. 

It was the first time he had ever 
seen so raw emotion on the girl’s 
face. Tears poured from only one 

THOUGHT FOR TODAY 



eye, but the entire effect on her 
lovely, tortured face was one of 
sorrow and desolation. 

He lifted her to her feet, gently, 
and she leaned against him. 

“Selena . ” 

“Oh, Mel. It was so terrible — 
seeing her like that — ” 

“I know, I know . .” 

“Do you?” She backed off and 
studied him. “Do you know what 
my mother’s gone through? We 
were on the perimeter of a blast 
area five years ago. My father and 
sister were killed outright. My 
mother lost the use of one hand. I 
got out — with this.” She gestured 
towards the unmoving side of her 
face. “She withstood it, Mel. Four 
awful tragedies — and she came 
through it. And now — ” 

She began to sob again. Danton 
waited patiently until the tears sub- 
sided. 

“I’m sure they’ll find a cure,” he 
said softly. “There have been cata- 
tonics before. They’ll help her,” 

She was moaning hopelessly. 

“This is different . differ- 
ent ...” 

She broke from him, and walked 
unsteadily to the window. She fold- 
ed her arms, and looked out at the 
gray clouds hovering overhead. 

“She called me at the office this 
morning. Something she hardly 
ever does. She was so worried. 
About snipers, she said. She felt 
they were everywhere, surrounding 
her — ” Her hands covered her 
face. 

“Snipers?” Danton blinked. 

“Oh, there have been snipers in 
the neighborhood before. But that 
was almost two years ago.”

“Newsear . .” the lieutenant 
said. 

“What?” 

“It happened to me — today — on 
the fourth floor.” 

“What did?” She turned to face 
him. 

“I’m not supposed to talk about 
it—” 

“Mel! If there’s something I 
should know — ” 

“Selena, I’ve been ordered!” His 
voice was pained. “I’m not sup- 
posed to say a word.” 

She came to him. “Mel, what are 
you talking about?” 

“Selena, listen. I can’t tell you 
any details — and God help me if 
you repeat any of this — 

“There’s another kind of News - 
ear” 

“Another kind?” Her. eyes wid- 
ened. 

“Yes, The earpieces the Newsear 
personnel wear are ‘clean’ — that’s 
what they call it. The earpieces ev- 
erybody else gets are ‘dirty’. They 
have a sub-unit — a secondary func- 
tion — that reaches right into the 
mind itself.” 

“What are you saying?” Her 
head was moving from side to side. 

“It’s true! There’s a secondary 
broadcast that takes place every 
day on the fourth floor. A message 
to the public ... a daily thought 
... a directive . .” 

“Why? What for?” 

“Don’t ask me to explain. I’ve 
never known about it until today. 
It’s a way of unifying the efforts of 
the people — Newsear tells them 
what to think.” 

“To think?” she repeated, her 
voice quivering. “Mel, that’s hor- 

100 



rible! You can’t direct the mind! 
You can’t force thought on people! 
It’s wrong! It’s worse than bombs!” 

“But they can , Selena! I’ve seen 
the proof — ” 

“We don’t know enough,” she 
whispered. “We don’t know what 
such a thing can do. What the 
mind will do . .” 

She took two backward steps, her 
eyes fixed on the man in front of 
her, her hands covering her ears. 

“Mel!” she screamed. “They did 
it. They did this to my mother!” 

At 6:30 a.m. the next day, the 
thin man named Douglas said to 
Danton : 

“This is your home now.” 

Danton looked around. It ap- 
peared to be more of a laboratory 
than a business office. 

“You’ll sit here, of course,” Dan- 
ton said smoothly, pointing to the 
well-padded leather chair. “Don’t 
let all those gadgets frighten you. 
Only three of them will actually 
make contact with your person. 
These electrodes will clamp on your 
head ; they’re quite painless. A very 
mild current, nothing alarming. 
And you’ll get used to it in time.” 

“I see,” the lieutenant said. 

“It will be your ability to con- 
centrate that matters here. You 
must work very hard to keep your 
mind free of nothing but the order 
of the day.” 

“And what will they be?” 

“The General Staff determines 
that. They vary from outpourings 
of patriotic feeling, to very specific 
drives.” 

Danton stroked the back of the 
chair. 



HENRY SLESAR 




“Have you heard much about 
these Frozen People ?” 

“Enough / 5 Douglas said. “What 
about them ? 55 

“What do you think is causing 
it ? 55 

“I’ve no idea , 55 he snapped. “I’m 
sure the authorities are working on 
it . 55 

Kirsch came in. “We’re ready to 
start . 55 

“The first day is the hardest,” 
Douglas said. “Good luck.” 

Strapped firmly into the chair, 
his arms imprisoned, his brain a 



tool of world affairs, Mel Dan ton 
waited for the signal to begin. 

“The order for today,” Douglas 
said, “is — beware of spies. No one 
is to be trusted. Report suspicious 
actions immediately to your Home 
Guard headquarters.” 

He clapped Danton’s back. 

“Now all you have to do is 
think.” 

He grinned, and left the room. 

Danton closed his eyes. 

“Destroy your Newsear ” he 
thought. “Destroy your News- 
ear ...” • • • 



THE CHASM 

(Continued from page 49) 
the seed. That’s what we’ve got to 
bring back, Sal. Between us, we 
have stored up a hundred and 
seventy-nine years of human cul- 
ture. There isn’t a kid back there, 
Sal, more than twelve years old.” 

“We’ll find a way,” Sal said. 

The rowboat was about fifteen 
feet away from the thick reeds 
growing in the marshy ooze of the 
bank. 

Cartley heard the sound first and 
turned, his face white. When Sal 
looked toward the bank, he saw the 
girl. She came on out from the cur- 
tain of reeds and looked at them. 
She was perfectly clear in the 
moonlight standing there. She wore 
a short ragged print dress and she 
had long hair that seemed silken 
and soft and golden in the moon- 
light even though it, her dress, her 
little legs and her face were 
streaked with mud. 

Sal hesitated, then pulled heavily 

THOUGHT FOR TODAY 



on his left oar and the boat nosed 
toward her. Up close, Sal could see 
her face, the clear blue eyes wet, 
and the tears running down her 
cheeks. 

The girl reached out and asked 
in a sobbing breath, 

“Granpa? Is that you, Granpa?” 

“Oh God, Oh God,” Cartley 
said. He was crying as he picked 
her up and got her into the boat. 
He was rocking her in his arms and 
half crying and half laughing as 
Sal rowed the boat upstream. 

“Yes, yes, honey,” Sal heard 
Cartley say over and over. “I’m 
your granpa, honey. Don’t cry. Go 
to sleep now. I’m your granpa and 
I’ve been looking for you, honey, 
and now everything’s going to be 
all right.” 

It’s funny, Sal thought, as he 
kept on rowing upstream. It’s a 
funny thing how one little girl re- 
membered her granpa, and how 
maybe that was the beginning of 
the bridge across the chasm. • • •

T HE RECEPTIONIST ushered 
the patient into Dr. Walter 
Needzak’s office. She punched her 
glasses higher onto the bridge of 
her nose, patted the bun of hair at 
the back of her head, and said : 
“This is Mr. Stallings, doctor.” 
Dr. Needzak motioned the pa- 
tient to a chair. Stallings sat down, 
slowly but limberly. He still held 
his hat, and placed it in the precise 
center of his lap. The receptionist 
handed a form to Dr. Needzak and 
returned to the waiting room, after 
looking once over her shoulder. 
“You’re only 125, Mr. Stall- 



felt got me so interested and ex- 
cited that I forgot what I wanted 
at the office, once I was there. So I 
thought that that was a hopeful 
enough sign for me to come around 
and see you.” 

Dr. Needzak, a young man at 50 
and who looked even younger, 
hoisted the stethoscope amplifier 
onto his desk, turned it on, and 
signalled for Stallings to unbutton 
his shirt. He placed the stethoscope 
against the bony chest. The bump- 
ing of the heart filled the room, 
drew a wild pattern on the unfold- 
ing strip of paper in the visual sec-

tient nodded sadly. “Well, you 
should be hale and hearty for an- 
other 50 years, judging by the re- 
port on your preliminary exam. 
Are you sure that it’s any use for 
you to consult me?” 

“I wouldn’t bother you,” Stall- 
ings said, age showing only in the 
high pitch of his voice, “except for 
the funny feeling in my chest the 
other day. I had to visit an office on 
the twelfth story. The elevator 
wasn’t running, so I walked up. 
Just as an experiment, I went as 
fast as I could. The way my chest 



tion of the amplifier, and created 
magnetic patterns on the tape. 

Dr. Needzak listened for two 
minutes, then thumbed through a 
reference listing of visual heart pat- 
terns. Finally he switched off the 
amplifier, and said: 

“You have no history of heart 
trouble.” 

“I’m afraid not.” 

“Well, I don’t want to raise false 
hopes. The only thing that I can 
suggest is more physical exertion. 
Really vigorous exertion, the kind 
that makes you pant and tremble 
and get a bit dizzy. Try that every 



103 




day for a month and come back to 
see me. There’s just a trace of a 
flutter now, and we might be able 
to speed up its development.” 

The old man smiled for the first 
time, at something that his eyes 
saw behind the white plaster of the 
far wall. Finally, Stallings rose to 
leave. Buttoning himself up, he 
said: “You’ll send the bill?” 

Dr. Needzak laughed genially. 
“I can see that you aren’t accus- 
tomed to visiting doctors, young 
man. The better the doctor, the 
more risky it is to send the bill. My 
policy is to request full payment 
before the patient leaves the office, 
just in case I’ve given the right sort 
of advice. In cases where I pre- 
scribe medicine, of course, you may 
pay for the prescription and the 
consultation fee simultaneously. Be- 
fore taking the medicine, you un- 
derstand.” Again he laughed. 

“I understand. I should have 
guessed. I work in a bank myself. I 
hate the work. I’m tired of every- 
thing, in fact. But I know how im- 
portant it is to pay promptly.” 

The doctor had just filed away 
Stallings’ physical record when the 
receptionist ushered in an extreme- 
ly elderly woman. Dr. Needzak 
smiled broadly, and said: 

“Mrs. Watkins! I didn’t expect 
to see you again so soon.” He 
waved in annoyance at the recep- 
tionist, who hovered behind the 
new patient. She left, reluctantly. 

Mrs. Watkins groped her way to 
the chair, wincing when the recep- 
tionist slammed the door. The old 
woman rubbed her bony forehead 
with a mottled hand that trembled 
and said: 



“I know that I wasn’t supposed 
to come back for another three 
months. But did you realize that I’ll 
have my 190th birthday before 
those three months are up? When 
a person gets to be that old, she 
looks forward to seeing the doctor 
more than she used to look forward 
for Santa to arrive back in the old 
days.” 

“No symptoms since your last 
visit?” Dr. Needzak spoke more 
loudly than usual in deference to 
her failing hearing, and turned up 
the light to aid weak, old eyes. 

“None.” She spat out the word. 
“I’m going to change doctors, if 
this keeps up. I’ve heard of a couple 
of doctors who aren’t as scrupulous 
as you are. After living all this time, 
I think that I could be permitted 
one little crime, lying to them 
about a symptom. Then I know 
that I’d be made happy. What’s 
the use being moral when you’re 
too frail and tottery to enjoy life?” 

Dr. Needzak shook his head, dis- 
approvingly. “I don’t think you’re 
quite as miserable as you think you 
are. Don’t go to those quack doc- 
tors. Suppose you’re caught, half- 
way through a crime? You might 
linger for decades, half-well, half- 
sick, from the effects of what 
they’d give you. Even the quacks 
won’t supply you with strychnine, 
you know.” 

“I know. I shouldn’t have sug- 
gested it. But I get so tired of liv-

“Well, I can’t see any physical 
trouble that could have developed 
enough to warrant a complete exam 
since your last one. Maybe those 
arteries will start hardening by the

time you have that 190th birthday. 
Or you could take up chemistry as 
a hobby. Just think what a fine 
explosion you might get mixed up 
in!” 

“I thought of that.” A couple of 
tears trickled down the wrinkled 
cheeks of Mrs. Watkins. “But the 
thrice-great-grandchildren watch 
me like a hawk. They don’t let me 
do anything that might hiirt me. I 
suppose I’ll just have to wait, and 
hope, and wait, and pray.” 

She rose, very suddenly. Then 
she shook her head disgustedly. “I 
don’t even get dizzy when I do that, 
like most people my age. Thank 
you, anyway, doctor.” Mrs. Wat- 
kins walked out with dignity. 

Dr. Needzak noticed that his 
waiting room was filling rapidly, 
during the two seconds that Mrs. 
Watkins opened the door to leave. 
He fumed inwardly at his patience 
in dealing at length with cases like 
the last two, whom he couldn’t pos- 
sibly be sure of helping. 

But his ill-humor was replaced 
by astonishment. The receptionist 
introduced a woman even younger 
than he. She was very pale, but Dr. 
Needzak guessed that that pallor 
derived from tension, not some rare 
organic disturbance. 

“Are you sure that you haven’t 
made a mistake, Miss Tillet?” He 
asked the question quietly, trying 
to catch her eyes. She kept them 
resolutely on her hands, which were 
folding and unfolding in her lap. 

“I talked with several good 
friends before coming to you, doc- 
tor,” the girl said. Her voice was 
very low. “You had been a good 
doctor for their grandparents or 

BUT THE PATIENT LIVED 



great-grandparents. They told me 
that you could help me, if anybody 
could.” 

“But your preliminary examina- 
tion shows nothing whatsoever 
wrong with you,” the doctor said. 
“It’ll be another century before you 
would normally develop the slight- 
est symptom on which I’d be al- 
lowed to work. And people of your 
age just don’t go to doctors. It’s 
only when you’re past the century 
mark, and know that decade after 
decade stretches out ahead of you, 
that you start feeling that a doctor 
might—” 

“Please,” she interrupted, almost 
inaudibly. “I don’t think that a 
physician should allow the consid- 
eration of a patient’s age to enter 
into his course of action. For per- 
sonal reasons, I may need a doctor 
more than the average person six 
times my age.” 

“Will you tell me something 
about yourself? I’m not curious, ex- 
cept as far as knowledge might 
affect my recommendations.” 

“I don’t care to discuss personal 
problems. Now, doctor, your assist- 
ant who gave the preliminary ex- 
amination overlooked the reason 
for my coming to you. Right here,” 
and she carefully touched a spot on 
the well-tailored dress. “I think 
that it might be a tumor.” 

“What good does it do to come 
to a doctor for that?” Dr. Needzak 
said. “Tumors are so rare that 
there’s very little chance that it’s 
more than your imagination. And 
the best physician can’t speed up 
the growth of a tumor, or change 
it from benign to malign.” 

“A physician can diagnose,” she 

105 




answered. “If it’s malign, I’ll be 
able to have patience. I won’t need 
to break the law.” Unexpectedly, 
grotesquely, she drew one finger 
across her throat in a cutting ges- 
ture, and looked squarely at him 
for the first time. 

Dr. Needzak walked softly to the 
door that led to the reception room. 
He drew noiselessly a bolt across 
the jamb, locking it. Then he 
pointed to another door, telling the 
girl: “Go in there and undress. I’ll 
be ready for you in a moment.” 

He whistled softly under his 
breath, as he pulled instruments 
and jars of colored substances from 
the deepest recesses of a cupboard. 

The girl already lay calmly on a 
metal table in the inner room when 
Dr. Needzak entered. He staggered 
a trifle under a precariously bal- 
anced pile of equipment in his 
arms. He explained : 

“I should let the receptionist do 
the hard work like this. But I don’t 
let her snoop around in this private 
room.” 

“Will you really need all those 
things?” the girl asked, uncertainly. 
“I thought that you just snip out a 
tiny specimen with a little gadget, 
to make a diagnosis.” 

“I could probably get along with 
just that one gadget,” the doctor 
said. He pulled a mask from a 
drawer and snapped on the sterilite. 
“But I’m an old boy scout at heart. 
Always prepared.” Unexpectedly, 
he plopped the mask squarely over 
the girl’s face. Her cry was almost 
inaudible, as the thick gauze 
clamped itself over her mouth, 
clung tightly beneath the jaw. 

Dr. Needzak pinioned her shoul- 

106 



ders to the table, while her legs 
kicked wildly for a* few seconds. 
The anesthetic stopped the kicking 
within five seconds. He waited for 
a count of ten, before he wrenched 
the mask free. Turning up the 
sterilite to full strength, Dr. Need- 
zak began to line up surgical instru- 
ments in a neat row, humming 
under his breath. 

Fifteen minutes later, the phy- 
sician made a pair of injections into 
the girl’s upper arm. Then he 
swished oxygen into her face until 
she recovered consciousness. 

“Wonderful stuff, this new an- 
esthetic,” he told her placidly. “It 
works fast, wears off just as fast, 
doesn’t leave the patient retching. 
Now, you can sit up slowly. If you 
don’t try anything strenuous for the 
next day or two, you’ll never know 
that you’ve had an operation.” 

Miss Tillett’s eyes widened. “Op- 
eration! I came here for a diag- 
nosis. I didn’t authorize — ” 

“I’m sorry. I operated without 
your consent. But I had a good rea- 
son. It wasn’t even a benign tumor 
that you had. It was only a cyst. If 
I had merely diagnosed, and told 
you the truth, you would have kept 
clinging to the hope that it might 
be a malign tumor. You wouldn’t 
have let me take it out. It would 
have grown big enough to disfigure 
you, not big enough to cause you 
any physical damage. You would 
have gone through the years with a 
new trouble, that of deformity, and 
you might have been mentally 
warped in the delusion that you 
had a fatal disease. You’re as sound 
as a rock.” 



HARRY WARNER, JR. 




Something inside the girl seemed 
to turn into liquid. She sat with 
slumped shoulders, arms dangling 
limply at her side, and head sunk 
so far that her chin rested against 
her chest. 

After a moment, she rose and 
walked slowly into the dressing 
cubicle. When she emerged, she 
ignored the doctor, unlocked the 
door with her own hands, and 
walked into the reception room, 
sobbing softly. 

Dr. Needzak cleaned up rapidly, 
and hustled into his main office to 
see his next patient. No one was 
there. He grumbled to himself and 
opened the door into the reception 
room. Blinking, he saw that it was 
empty. It had been filling rapidly, 
not a half-hour earlier. 

The doctor had heard no noises 
indicating a commotion on the 
street outside; and that was the 
only reason he could think of for 
the sudden disappearance of his 
patients. To make sure, he strode 
through the reception room, walked 
briskly down the short hall, and 
stuck his head through the door 
leading into the street. Everything 
appeared normal in the bustling 
business district, until a large, black 
sedan ground to a stop at the curb 
in a no parking zone. The recep- 
tionist climbed from the vehicle, 
two men behind her. 

“Miss Waters!” Dr. Needzak ex- 
ploded, when she reached the 
building’s entrance. “What do you 
mean by leaving without my per- 
mission? All my patients have left. 
They must have thought that office 
hours were over.” 

The receptionist gave him one 

BUT THE PATIENT LIVED 



baleful look, and shoved past him 
into the building. And Dr. Needzak 
suddenly recognized the two men. 

“Bill Carson! And Pop Manville! 
What brings you big doctors down 
here to see a small-time pill-dealer 
like me?” 

“Let’s go into your office,” Pop 
said, softly. He was old, tall and 
gaunt with a perpetual look of 
worry. Dr. Carson, younger and 
bustling, evaded Dr. Needzak’s 
eyes. 

Miss Waters was shoveling per- 
sonal belongings from her desk into 
a giant handbag, when they reached 
the reception room. Dr. Needzak 
felt her eyes upon him, as the other 
two physicians kept him moving by 
the sheer impetus of their bodies 
into his consultation room. 

“Where is it, Walt?” Dr. Man- 
ville asked, looking gloomily around 
the consultation room. 

“Where’s what, Pop? The 
drinks? I keep them — ” 

“The door to your operating 
room,” Dr. Carson interrupted, 
hurriedly. “Let’s not drag this thing 
out. It’s going to be painful enough, 
among old friends. Your private of- 
fice has been wired for sight and 
sound for the past three weeks. You 
shouldn’t have tried to get away 
with that kind of practice in a big 
city.” 

Dr. Needzak felt the blood drain- 
ing from his face. He reached fof 
a drawer. Dr. Manville grabbed hk 
arm with a tight, claw-like grasp f 
before it could touch the handle. 

“It’s all right, Pop,” he said. 
“Nothing but gin in there. I’m not 
the violent type.” 

Dr. Carson pulled open the 

107 




drawer toward which he had 
reached. He pulled out the tall bot- 
tle, slipped off the patent top, and 
sniffled. Handing it to Dr. Needzak, . 
he said : 

“Okay. You need some. Then 
save the rest for us. We’ll feel like 
it, too, when we’re done.” 

Dr. Needzak coughed after three 
large swallows. He looked at the 
other two doctors. “Who ratted?” 
Dr. Carson nodded toward the 
reception room. Dr. Needzak in- 
stinctively clenched his fists. He 
half-rose from his chair, then sank 
back slowly. “I thought you guys 
were my friends,” he said. 

“We are, Walt,” Dr. Manville 
said thoughtfully. “But this is busi- 
ness. When someone charges viola- 
tion of medical ethics, we’re the in- 
vestigation committee. It looks like 
a simple investigation this time, 
with those tapes on file.” 

“What does she have against 
you, anyway?” Dr. Carson asked. 
“Usually a receptionist will go 
through hell to cover up little flubs 
for her boss. Were you mixed up 
with her in a personal way?” 
“Mixed up with her?” Dr. Need- 
zak laughed mirthlessly. “She’s 
worked for me fifteen years. I’ve 
never made a pass at her.” 

Dr. Manville nodded sadly. 
“That was your mistake, Walt. 
Frustration. Disappointment. Worse 
than jealousy. Now, why not tell us 
everything?” 

“There’s nothing to tell. Those 
tapes give a false impression, some- 
times. I just take difficult cases 
back there where I’m sure there 
won’t be any disturbance.” 

“No tise,” Dr. Carson inter- 

108 



rupted. “Things will be harder for 
you, if we lose patience with you. 
We know you’ve been curing illness 
against the patient’s wishes, time 
after time. We just saw you take 
out a tumor. The poor kid will 
probably drag through another 
hundred years before she develops 
anything else serious. You pre- 
scribed anticoagulants to a man 
with an obvious blood clot. You 
even talked a couple with weak 
lungs into moving to Denver.” 

“All right, it was a tumor,” Dr. 
Needzak admitted. “It was malign 
and it would have killed her in two 
or three years. But she’s too young 
to make a decision for herself. Five 
years from now, she may have a 
different outlook on her personal 
problems. I have ethics, and I can’t 
help it if they don’t correspond in 
some details with the association’s 
ethics.” 

“You were given your medical 
license under an oath to respect 
the ethics of the profession,” Dr. 
Manville said slowly, emphatically. 
“The license did not give you the 
right to practice under ethics of 
your own invention.” 

“Ethics!” Dr. Needzak looked 
as if he wanted to spit. “Ethics is 
just a word. There was a time when 
physicians spent their time curing 
diseases and preventing them. They 
called that ethics. nNow that there 
aren’t enough illnesses left to give 
us work, now that people live long 
past the time when they want to go 
on living, now that we make our 
money helping people commit sui- 
cide the legal way, we call that 
ethics.” 

“You can’t annihilate a concept 
HARRY WARNER, JR. 




simply by thinking it’s only a 
word,” Dr. Manville said. “There 
was a time when physicians used 
leeches for almost every patient. 
They fitted that nasty habit into 
their ethics. You wouldn’t want to 
introduce leeches into this century 
would you? But you should, if 
you’re so consistently opposed to 
anything that sounds like changes 
in ethics.” 

“But I’ve done my part to get 
rid of human miseries,” Dr. Need- 
zak said, nodding toward a filing 
cabinet. “I can show you the data 
on hundreds of my patients. Old 
folks, who just got tired of living; 
I helped them die legally. Even 
younger people, who had a genuine 
reason for being tired of life. I 
couldn’t have my fine home or pay 
rent in this building, if I went 
around curing every patient. 
There’s no money in that.” 

“You wouldn’t keep a filing cab- 
inet for the times you disobeyed 
the medical code,” Dr. Carson 
broke in. “But we have some of 
those cases on tape. You didn’t re- 
fuse to handle the cases. You went 
ahead and played God, going di- 
rectly against the direct will of your 
patients. Did you follow up all of 
the patients who aren’t in your file 
cabinets? We traced the later 
records of some of them. Several 
suicided right out in the open. 
Their families haven’t gotten back 
on their feet from the disgrace yet.” 

Dr. Needzak took two more deep 
swallows from the bottle. He looked 
glumly at the low level of the liquid 
through its dark side, saying: 

“You fellows are enjoying this 
conversation more than old friends 

BUT THE PATIENT LIVED 



should enjoy the job of taking ac- 
tion against a fellow-doctor. And 
I’ll tell you why you aren’t too un- 
happy about it. You’re jealous of 
me. You’re jealous of the fact that 
I’ve been following a physician’s 
natural instincts and healing 
people. You’re angry with me for 
doing the things that you’d really 
love to do yourselves, if you had the 
guts. You aren’t worried about that 
girl; you’re peeved because you’d 
give your shirts for a chance to 
take out a genuine tumor yourself.” 
“Admitted,” Dr. Carson said 
cheerfully. “I haven’t seen a live 
tumor in three or four years. 
They’re scarce. But we can’t sit 
here chatting. We don’t want to 
end up arguing.” 

Dr. Needzak rose. “What do I 
do, then?” 

“The best action would be to 
come along with us to the associa- 
tion headquarters,” Dr. Manville 
advised, avoiding Dr. Needzak’s 
eyes. “In a half-hour or so, you can 
sign enough statements to avoid 
weeks of hearings. Otherwise, we’ll 
be forced to bother lots of other 
physicians, hunt up your old pa- 
tients, endure newspaper publicity, 
and have a general mess.” 

“After that, I start pounding 
the pavements, hunting a job.” Dr. 
Needzak flexed his long, lean fin- 
gers. “Is it hard to learn how to op- 
erate ditch diggers?” 

Dr. Carson stood up and slapped 
him on the back. “It isn’t that bad. 
You can find a place in any phar- 
macy in the country, if we get 
through this disbarment without 
publicity. You’ll never be rich, 
handing out irritants and hyper- 

109 




stimulants, but — ” 

Dr. Needzak was already strid- 
ing toward the street. The other 
two doctors trailed after him, wait- 
ing while he locked up carefully. 
They glanced at one another signif- 
icantly, noting that he had uncon- 
sciously brought along his little 
black bag. Dr. Needzak explained 
as they began the two-block walk 
to association headquarters : 

“The kids are married and away 
from home. I suppose that I can 
get enough income from sub-leas- 
ing the office to keep the wife and 
me eating until I find — ” 

A grating crash broke into his 
sentence. The three doctors whirled 
simultaneously. Thin wails drifted 
through the constant rumble of 
traffic, from somewhere around a 
comer. People erupted from build- 
ings, running toward the source of 
the noise. The doctors instinctively 
trotted after them. 



T HEY TURNED the comer, 
coming upon a rare sight. It 
was a motor vehicle accident, first 
in the business district for months. 
A school bus lay on its side, just 
short of the intersection. Children 
were clambering cautiously from 
the emergency door. The uniformed 
driver was ignoring his passengers, 
staring in disbelief at the radar 
controls at the street comer, which 
had failed a moment earlier. 

The other vehicle involved in the 
crash was wrapped around a power 
pole. It was an auto of antique vin- 
tage, produced before full auto- 
matic driving provisions. There 
weren’t more than a dozen such 

no 



vehicles remaining on the streets 
of the city. The radar controls al- 
most never went on the blink. Only 
the combination of the vehicle and 
the inoperative controls could have 
created an accident. 

Dr. Needzak led the other doc- 
tors through the thickening crowd, 
to the side of the bus. Kids were no 
longer climbing through the emer- 
gency exist, but noises were com- 
ing from within the vehicle. His 
bag under his left arm, he hauled 
himself atop the overturned bus, 
and dropped through the emer- 
gency exit into its half-dark interior. 
He saw the other two doctors out- 
lined against the sky, as they 
perched on the horizontal side of 
the vehicle, peering down, helpless 
without their bags. 

Dr. Needzak found a small boy 
sprawled awkwardly around a seat, 
bleeding rapidly from the leg, face 
ashen, unconscious. The physician 
clipped off the trousers leg, bound 
the leg tightly above the deep gash, 
and slipped on a bandage. Then he 
lifted the small boy up to Dr. Car- 
son. 

A girl was struggling to raise her- 
self from the next seat, obviously 
unaware that the leg wouldn’t sup- 
port her because it had suffered a 
compound fracture. Dr. Needzak 
forced a grin when he attracted her 
attention. He persuaded her to lie 
flat. With one quick motion, he 
rough-set the leg. Then he boosted 
her out of the vehicle, and looked 
down to investigate the source of 
the plucking at his coat. 

It was a small, chubby boy, 
standing beside him. “I’m hurt 
real bad,” the boy said. Needzak 

HARRY WARNER, JR. 




ran his hands over the boy’s body 
to make sure the bones were 
sound. “You better take care of me 
real quick/’ the child said, looking 
more worried than ever. 

Dr. Needzak made sure that the 
blood on the boy’s cheek came 
from only a scratch, and found the 
heartbeat normal. So he pulled a 
a sugar wafer from his bag and 
ordered the boy to swallow it. 

“Think you can climb out now?” 
Dr. Needzak asked. The youngster, 
face brightening, leaped to the door 
and went out unassisted. 

The only child remaining in the 
vehicle hadn’t uttered a sound. 
But the doctor sensed that her 
breathing was heavier. He bent 
over her, and pushed back the lid 
of her half-closed eye. When he 
saw the back of her head, he 
stopped his hasty examination. Her 
words were barely audible. “Am I 
hurt bad?” 

“Why, there won’t even be any 
pain,” Dr. Needzak told her cheer- 
fully. Before he could yell to the 
other doctors to call for a stretcher, 
the girl’s breathing stopped. 

Slowly, as if suddenly tired, Dr. 
Needzak climbed out of the ve- 
hicle. 

Police had already dispersed the 
crowd. Tow trucks were waiting to 
haul away the vehicles. The injured 
children were gone. The three 
doctors resumed their walk. 

Dr. Needzak felt the eyes of the 
other two men on him, lost pa- 
tience after a moment, and said 
irritably: 

“Go ahead, start bawling me out. 
But I’ve not signed anything yet. 
I’m still a licensed physician. I had 

BUT THE PATIENT LIVED 



every right to help those kids.” 
The other two doctors stopped, 
looking at one another, as if trying 
to probe each other’s thoughts. 
Simultaneous smiles spread over 
their faces. Dr. Needzak stopped 
walking, when he heard them 
starting to laugh. He pushed be- 
tween them with a frown, asking: 
“Look, if you — ” 

Dr. Carson slapped him on the 
back, hard. Dr. Manville grasped 
Dr. Needzak’s hand and squeezed 
it with unexpected strength. 

“The same thing hit us both at 
the same time, I’ll bet,” the older 
doctor said. “It would be the ideal 
thing for you.” 

Dr. Carson was pumping Dr. 
Needzak’s other hand up and 
down. “Sure. Emergency physician! 
I don’t know why we didn’t think 
of that in the first place. Accidents 
still happen now and then. It isn’t 
easy to find doctors who are willing 
to specialize in them, because it 
isn’t steady income and it doesn’t 
pay a whole lot. But you have those 
screwball ideas about helping 
people to get well. And that’s just 
what an emergency physician must 
do.” 

“I’ll talk to a couple of the men 
on the association board as soon 
as I can get to a telephone,” Dr. 
Manville said. “I think I can per- 
suade them to assign you to acci- 
dents without going through a dis- 
barring procedure, as long as you 
agree to stay away from general 
practice. You’re willing, I assume?” 
Dr. Needzak pulled his hands 
free and looked at the spots of dried 
blood that remained on the fin- 
gers and palms. He hadn’t been able

A new type of bus will be built as 
soon as countries of the world have 
roads to take it. The new coach is 
to be built entirely of plastic and 
will be roofed with polarized glass, 
so that passengers will have an un- 
interrupted view without having to 
worry about the glare of the strong- 
est sun. Passengers will be seated in 
individual armchairs that can be 
inclined or swiveled at will. The 
plastic construction will make for 
extreme lightness, but give the 
same strength now associated only 
with metal construction. The coach 
is to be air-conditioned, and the de- 
sign includes arrangements for ra- 
dio-telephone and television. Other 
equipment includes refrigerator, 
coffee-machine and buffet. Suspen- 
sion of the coach will be indepen- 
dent on all four wheels, incorporat- 
ing a balancing system for expect- 
ed high speeds. It will also have 
special tubeless tires and the gas 
turbine motor, which is being built 
by Fiat, will be mounted under the 
floorboards. 

The boss of the future may dictate 
letters directly to a phonetic type- 
writer or speech writer that will 
type out his words. A model of such 



a voice-operated typewriter has al- 
ready been constructed and has a 
vocabulary of ten common English 
words, including “Are, see, a.” It 
types from dictation with 80 % ac- 
curacy which, researchers comment, 
“is probably as good as the average 
secretary.” The first step toward the 
speech writer was to analyse speech 
in terms of “formants”. Next prob- 
lem was conversion of the energy of 
speech sounds into a series of visual 
tokens whose number of types is on 
the same order as the number of 
different symbols in a written lan- 
guage. Development also includes 
such factors as the particular form 
in which the word is typed, the 
means for analyzing the sounds of 
speech, identification of sounds, 
translating sounds into impulses for 
actuating the machine, and finally 
design of mechanism for operating 
the typewriter. 

Next step in keeping the atomic 
peace may be internationalization 
of the radar and other warning 
nets. Scientists in the know have 
privately been suggesting that it 
might be effective for both the U.S. 
and the Russians to admit that 
their warning networks are in great 
danger of clashing and getting 
mixed up with each other. They 
suggest that the two countries get 
together and man a jointly consoli- 
dated warning line pointed both 
ways. Each side would, of course, 
reserve the right to have their own 
air intelligence. With United Na- 
tions the logical agency to perform 
the function, World peace may be 
bought more cheaply and more 
safely with such a joint operation.

Paper made from sugar cane may 
soon help solve the shortage of 
pulpwood for papermaking. A fi- 
brous residue of sugar cane stalks, 
known as bagasse, is already being 
made into newsprint. Now agricul- 
ture scientists have found an eco- 
nomical method for making other 
grades of paper from the waste 
product. The new process separates 
bagasse fibers from the pith, which 
gives greater strength to fibers for 
use in making fine bleached papers 
and packaging materials. Bagasse 
papers are stronger than softwood 
papers in all but tearing resistance. 
They are particularly suited for 
blending with wood pulps to make 
different kinds of paper products. 
The pith remaining after bagasse 
fibers are extracted is useful as a 
carrier for blackstrap molasses used 
as feed. 

An atomic arsenal on rails designed 
to fight the nation’s destructive ag- 
ricultural pests may soon be criss- 
crossing the nation’s farmlands. As 
a mobile railway irradiation station, 
the proposed “Atomic Flyer” could 
be used to treat potatoes to keep 
them from sprouting; process citrus 
fruits, curtail fruit fly infestation, 
increase the shelf-life of seafoods 
and sterilize the insects in grain and 
cereal that annually eat their way 
through $3,000,000,000 worth of 
food. Preliminary design is already 
completed and it is hoped that the 
73-ton unit can be built by gov- 
ernment or industry and placed in 
operation within two years. En- 
gineers estimate the radiation train 
will cost $93,400 to build and 
$114,000 a year to operate. The 

114 



rolling station could handle from 
one-half to 1 1 tons of food an hour, 
depending on the dosage required. 
The cost of treatment per ton 
would range from $2.25 to $40.80. 

Earth is now between two Ice Ages 
and another glacial advance can be 
expected within a few centuries, ac- 
cording to proposals made by sci- 
entists recently. Some hundreds of 
years from now, temperature de- 
creases will mark the start of a new 
glacial period. At the time, the 
Arctic Ocean, which seems to have 
been warming up recently, will be 
entirely ice free. For the last few 
thousand years, researchers point 
out, temperatures have remained 
about as high as the highest value 
reached during any previous inter- 
glacial stages. These temperatures 
are regulated by the surface layers 
of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, 
not external conditions. An ice-free 
Arctic Ocean would result in a 
marked increase in the exchange of 
water between the Arctic and the 
Atlantic, warming the former and 
cooling the latter. An open Arctic 
would provide moisture for glacier 
growth but would eventually reduce 
sea level, resulting in a sharp de- 
crease of the inflow of warm At- 
lantic water into the Arctic Ocean. 
The cooling effect would eventually 
produce a new Arctic ice sheet. 

A "made to order" super alloy, rep- 
resenting a major step forward in 
metallurgy, was shown in New 
York recently by its developers. The 
alloy, called Nivco, was hailed by 
scientists as the forerunner of a new 
class of metals that can be “tailor- 



SCIENCE BRIEFS 




made” to do a specific job. Impor- 
tant as is the alloy itself, research 
technique used to develope the al- 
loy is perhaps more important. The 
process permits “predesign” of 
needed properties in an alloy before 
it is ever prepared, thereby elimi- 
nating the time-and-money-con- 
suming “cut and try” methods now 
being used. The new material, five 
times stronger than 12% chrome 
steel, resists breakdown when sub- 
jected to temperatures as high as 
1,200 degrees Fahrenheit and me- 
chanical vibration. Although exact 
ingredients of the new alloy were 
not disclosed, metallurgists said it 
contained cobalt and nickel and 
smaller amounts of five additional 
elements. An immediate application 
for the alloy will be for high-tem- 
perature steam turbine blades. 

The day when television antennas 
can pick up any station within 
range without need of rotation is 
foreseen. Physicists have found that, 
at least in theory, pick-up can be 
altered by feeding power to points 
other than the center of the an- 
tenna as is now done. Changing the 
power feed point should set up re- 
ception waves simultaneously in 
from two to several directions. The 
study was initiated because when 
the artificial satellite is launched 
communication between it and 
Earth is important and very little 
is yet known about the mathemati- 
cal equations which govern the op- 
eration of antennas. Since a rocket 
or satellite couldn’t use an outside 
antenna, scientists are investigating 
the possibility of cigar shaped an- 
tennas and find that it is possible to 

SCIENCE BRIEFS 



treat the rocket itself as an antenna 
by applying electrical charges to 
various parts of the rocket. 

Radiation forecasts may soon be ap- 
pearing in the daily newspapers 
along with the weather summaries. 
Since such information is more vital 
potentially, to human health and 
welfare than temperature or rain- 
fall figures, the National Academy 
of Sciences has suggested it as one 
way to keep people posted for their 
personal safety and the prevention 
of defective children in future gen- 
erations. In the atomic industry 
each worker carries a radiation 
badge. In our atomic world every- 
one may be asked to carry some 
such radiation record or to be in- 
spected, like one’s car, periodically. 
Or we may have personal X-ray 
records for medical radiation, and 
doctors and dentists may be re- 
quired to go through them periodi- 
cally to check radiation “debits”. 
Even the prospective bride may ask 
for such information on the groom 
along with such prosaic matters as 
money in the bank.

my fault. They killed him because 
he tried to help us.” 

“No,” said Jerry. “It had noth- 
ing to do with you. He told us 
about you, but they never knew 
of any connection, either way. 
Mark slipped up somewhere along 
the line, or they were too clever 
for him. It’s a chance we all take. 

“We volunteer to go in. To in- 
filtrate the system and help point 
up its evils and contradictions to in- 
telligent people — people like you.” 
“You had me fooled, “Oren said. 
“But in the end it was that crazy 
gag line of yours that we remem- 
bered — and we went.” 

“You certainly did,” Jerry said. 
“You went a lot sooner than we 
expected you to and we had the 
devil’s own time finding you. I 
come here every Jubilee Day — 
guiding a tour of drunks from In- 
side makes fine camouflage. It’s 
a sort of wide-open town anyway 
and I can report and get new in- 
structions from Outside. The old 
man told me you were here. He’s 
one of us.” 

“I liked him, too,” Oren said. 
“How many of you are there, In- 
side?” 

“Plenty of us. There have to be, 
because there are a lot of you — 
people we need Outside.” 

“You need us?” Edith asked. 
“Honestly? We’re not just — refu- 
gees?” 

“You’re a cause celebre” Jerry 
said. “And in that connection I 
think I can reassure you about your 
baby, Mrs. Donn.” Edith looked 
toward the crib where Marty was 



sleeping. “The new *one,” Jerry 
said. “We’ve had experience with 
the para-ray and your baby will be 
all right.” 

“Thank God,” said Edith. 

“And of course we need you,” 
Jerry went on. “We’re rebuilding 
from nothing. We’ve got willing 
hands and stout hearts but we need 
a brain or two besides. And a little 
music to lighten the burden, Mrs. 
Donn. 

“We want to live in peace with 
the City-States, even though we’re 
the remnants of their defeated en- 
emies. But if we can’t live side 
by side in dignity and if it 
comes to a struggle, one day 
there’ll be a lightning coup from 
within and without simultaneously. 
As I said, there are many of us, and 
some of us are pretty high up.” 

“Do you mean in the govern- 
ment itself?” Oren asked. 

Jerry smiled. “I’ve talked too 
much already. And I have to get 
back to the roisterers. Now go to 
sleep. Talk to the old man in the 
morning and he’ll send you to a 
man who’ll show you the way.” 

As he left them, Jerry Hilarious 
said softly, smiling and without 
the gesture: 

“G’wan outside!” 

As they walked, the next morn- 
ing, towards sanity and dignity, the 
sun came out. It was warm and 
friendly. 

Edith felt a slight movement of 
life inside her. 

Maybe she’d never write the 
fourth movement of her symphony 
now, but she didn’t care. She was 
beginning to live it. • • •

Dear Mr. Quinn: 

In the “Hue and Cry” section 
(which, by the way, I seldom read) 
of the August issue of IF, I came 
across an Ed’s note at the very bot- 
tom of the last page which ran: 
“Reader Bellows has grabbed a 
tiger by the tail. Hope he’s got 
more than personal opinions to 
back up his stand.” . After read- 
ing the preceding letter, I was in- 
clined to agree that Bellows had in- 
deed grabbed a tiger by the tail. 

By the very nature of his (or her) 
letter, even the most rear-ranked 
amateur is able to deduce that 
friend Bellows is a fatalist in his be- 
liefs about Mankind’s destiny. And, 
in the fault-finding way of every 
fatalist, is living up to his name by 
BELLO Wing about it to the high 
heavens. In the relatively short time 
that Man has thrived upon this 
planet as an intelligent species, he 



has literally lifted himself by his 
bootstraps to a position where he is 
able to look back at what he has 
achieved with a certain amount of 
satisfaction; in the same breath, he 
is able to look forward to the posi- 
tion he desires to attain avoiding 
the dangerous pitfalls he has come 
to recognize across the years 
through a process of trial and error. 

I believe I can sum up my whole 
gripe in the words of Omar Khy- 
yam ; fatalist ; deceased : 

“The Moving Finger writes; and, 
having writ, 

Moves on : nor all your piety nor 
wit 

Shall lure it back to cancel half 
a line, 

Nor all your tears wash out a 
word of it.” 

Dwell on that, Sir (Lady) Bel- 
lows!!!”

Dear Editor: 

I agree with K.J. Ashton in that 
a meeting with “aliens” is inevita- 
ble, and that science fiction is not 
helping us prepare for it. What if 
this meeting is being prevented, or 
has been prevented by the adverse 
mental stereotypes created by sci- 
ence fiction? 

Science fiction novels, magazines 
and especially Hollywood films have 
painted aliens, whether correctly or 
otherwise, in an unfavorable light. 
I feel too many people would adopt 
a “shoot first” attitude because of 
this overall picture. 

It seems thus logical to assume 
that under such a deluge of unfa- 
vorable writing and the mental at- 



117 




titudes it is creating, no alien would 
risk open contact. 

— Allan Marcus 
Lorain, Ohio 

Sirs: 

There are two questions I would 
like to answer. First — concerning 
the cruelness of characters from 
outer space — frankly, I believe this 
portrayal is a mistake. If man is 
to prepare for the meeting, why 
isn’t it just as plausibkito suppose 
these creatures or beings are the 
sort that would realize our short- 
comings and be willing to help us? 

And two: This fellow Bellows — 
yes, I agree, Man is not ready for 
other worlds. He has had Utopia at 
his finger-tips — stripped it bare, up- 
set its natural laws, bickered and 
destroyed. How can he expect to 
exact Utopia from another world 
when he can not even manage his 
own? 

Mankind has not reached his full 
potential and this would seem to me 
to be the first step he must take . 
his own perfection! Then and only 
then will he be ready to look on 
other horizons, other worlds.

Dear Editor: 

The obvious fallacy of Mr. Ash- 
ton’s letter was too great for me to 
let it pass unchallenged. I fear that 
all he has done is to show his igno- 
rance of science fiction. 

So he wants kind aliens, does he? 
Well what about Ho-Pan Xvin in 
Tenn’s “The Deserter”; Maeth in 
“The Witness” by Eric Frank Rus- 
sell; the People in Zenna Hender- 



son’s “Ararat” ; the alien in “Alien” 
by Lester del Rey; Nemo in “The 
Clinic” by Sturgeon * and a host of 
others — in particular lovable Mr. 
Green in Richard Wilson’s heart- 
warming “Friend of the Family”. 

I suggest that Mr. Ashton read 
these and if he isn’t forced to eat 
his words I’ll send him some more.

Dear Mr. Quinn: 

In criticism of Mr. Ryder’s letter 
in the June issue. I would like to 
comment that his complaint against 
anti-science “humanists” is too gen- 
eral. We must realize that many 
scientists are “humanists” in their 
own way and not a few “human- 
ists” are also scientifically minded, 
in the material sense. 

The morality of scientific discov- 
eries in the physical realm arises in 
the application of these discoveries; 
both “humanists” and scientists 
share the blame for any existing 
evils stemming from technical prog- 
ress. It is well known how far afield 
certain scientists go, even to the ex- 
tent of dogmatically pronouncing 
on metaphysical problems such as 
the existence of God. On the other 
hand, many humanists have adopt- 
ed the spirit of science, namely 
pragmatism, in investigations, in so- 
cial, religious and philosophical 
subjects. Paradoxically, this last 
group breeds anti-intellectual phi- 
losophers. Justification for either 
attitude, I suppose, can be found in 
the fact that some people regard 
man as a mere material being. The 
controversy is not between “smug 
liberal arts” and “disinterested 



118 



HUE AND CRY 




physical science*’, but between 
pragmatism and classic traditional- 
ism, between expedient morals and 
necessary morals. If we take the 
trouble to look, we will find “hu- 
manists” and scientists on both sides 
of the fence, so neither faction 
alone is to blame for the evils of ap- 
plied science.

Dear Mr. Quinn: 

I want to compliment you on the 
June issue of IF, especially “Z”. I’ll 
go so far as to say that newspaper- 
man Fontenay’s “Z” is the best 
story I’ve ever read. It is one of the 
few times I have ever seen a com- 
pletely new concept used. However, 
a couple of things seem to be in- 
adequately explained: 1. Since 

Summer was regressing, or rather 
growing backward through time, 
how can her affection for Thomas 
the cat, which led her to be caught 
in the explosion, be explained (un- 
less it was a holdover from her pre- 
vious existence as Mark) ? 2. I can 
see how, immediately before the ex- 
plosion, Summer would speak and 
act in reverse, but why would each 
separate word be normally spoken? 

I’ve been reading IF for over two 
years now, and I honestly believe 
it’s the best s-f magazine on the 
market. Would also like to hear 
from other sfans in the area. 

— Charles Boldrick 
Lebanon, Ky. 

The affection for Thomas was in- 
deed a holdover . we know be- 
cause we asked the same question. 
We thought of the other one too; 

HUE AND CRY 



but decided we could take some 
“poetic license” since both printers 
and proofreaders would have gone 
stark staring mad if we tried to spell 
all the words backwards too — to say 
nothing of the readers . 

Dear Mr. Quinn: 

I have recently carried a figure 
to the fourth dimension and am 
now working out a formula. It 
proves that time travel is impos- 
sible and that the future doesn’t 
exist until we get there. If you 
would like to have the formula for 
your letter column please let me 
know. 

— Wiley Jordan, Jr. 

Brookings, Ore. 

We definitely do want to see that 
formula and we’re darn sure most 
of our readers do too.

you can teach us something about

“Oh yes!” said Olbu eagerly. 
“And if I have by any chance cast 
reflections on your planet . 

“My dear Mr. Olbu, science has 
never suffered when scientists have 
dealt frankly with problems at 
hand.” 

“I’m afraid our time is up,” put 
in Cecil Burroughs. “Thank you 
gentlemen, and I hope our viewers 
will tune in again next week when 
we will have two interesting per- 
sonalities, Sam Katchum, who 
tames rattlesnakes, and Joe Wat- 
tles, who stuffs cobras. Glad we 
could be together.”

er’s hand as he emerged from the

broadcast room. “You saved my 
life; you saved my job!” 

“Think nothing of it, Ralph. It 
was nothing I wouldn’t have done 
for myself.” 

“But if you hadn’t known about 
GC1242 becoming a super nova — ” 
“You don’t think the loss of 
GC1242 was accidental, do you?” 
“Good Lord, Bruber. I don’t 
know anything about those things.” 
“As our friend Olbu said, Man 
develops along certain patterns . 
first his own planet, then neighbor- 
ing planets, then star systems.” 
“You don’t think—?” 

“I do, Rodkey. I do. Somebody 
else was just a little more advanced 
than GC1242 and did to them 
what they wanted to do to us.”

ROUTINE FOR A HORNET 

unconscious. His face was battered 
by windblast almost beyond recog- 
nition, and his body equally so. 
When the rescue team pulled him 
from the water, three hours later, 
they thought he was an old man. 
His eyes were a mass of red, from 
dozens of sub-conjunctival hemor- 
rhages. He would see again, but not 
until after weeks of near blindness. 

But he was alive. When he woke 
up in the California hospital four 
days later, he considered ruefully 
that that was about the best one 
could expect in his business. 

“Cressey, can you hear me?” 
“Yes, I can hear you. Who is it?” 
“It’s Captain Mackley. I’ve come 



(Continued from page 59) 
to see you.” 

“Well — thanks, Captain.” 

“You got the Outspacer, Cressey. 
I thought you’d like to know.” 

“Frankly, Captain, I couldn’t 
care less. But thanks for telling me, 
anyway.” 

“It means a lot, Cressey. There 
were a lot of people’s lives riding 
with you.” 

Yeah , Fm a hero. Fm a Hornet- 
man. 

“Thanks, Captain.” 

“Was it pretty rough?” 

Rough ? Like birth and death and 
all of life , rolled into minutes. 

“No more so than I expected, 
Captain. Pretty much routine. 
Routine for a Hometman.” • • •
