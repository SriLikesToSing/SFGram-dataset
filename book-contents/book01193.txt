Sailing in toward a rendezvous 
with Janus, Bamum and Bailey en- 
countered a giant, pulsing quarter- 
note. The stem was a good five 
kilometers tall. The note itself was 
a kilometer in diameter, and glowed 
a faint turquoise. It turned ponder- 
ously on its axis as they approached 
it. 

“This must be the place,” Bar- 
num said to Bailey. 

“Janus approach-control to Bar- 
num and Bailey,” came a voice 
from the void. “You will encounter 
the dragline on the next revolution. 
You should be seeing the visual in- 
dicator in a few minutes.” 

Barnum looked down at the 
slowly turning, irregular ball of 
rock and ice that was Janus, inner- 
most satellite of Saturn. Something 
was coming up behind the curve of 
the horizon. It didn’t take long for 
enough of it to tecome visible so 
they could see what it was. Bamum 
had a good laugh. 

“Is that yours, or theirs?” he 
asked Bailey. 

Bailey sniffed. “Theirs. Just how 
siUy do you think I am?” 

The object rising behind the 
curve of the satellite was a butterfly 
net, ten kilometers tall. It had a 
long, fluttering net trailing from a 
gigantic hoop. Bailey sniffed again, 
but applied the necessary vectors to 
position them for being swooped up 
in the preposterous thing. 

“Come on, Bailey,” Barnum 
chided. “You’re just jealous be- 
cause you didn’t think of it first.” 



“Maybe so,” the symb con- 
ceded. “Anyway, hold onto your 
hat, this is likely to be quite a 
jerk.” 

The illusion was carried as far as 
was practical, but Barnum noticed 
that the first tug of deceleration 
started sooner than one would ex- 
pect if the transparent net was more 
than an illusion. The force built up 
gradually as the electromagnetic 
field clutched at the metal belt he 
had strapped around his waist. It 
lasted for about a minute. When it 
had trailed off, Janus no longer ap- 
peared to rotate beneath them. It 
was growing closer. 

“Listen to this,” Bailey said. 
Barnum’s head was filled with mu- 
sic. It was bouncy, featuring the 
reedy, flatulent, yet still engaging 
tones of a bass saxophone in a 
honky-tonk tune that neither of 
them could identify. They shifted 
position and could just make out the 
location of Pearly Gates, the only 
human settlement on Janus. It was 
easy to find because of the weav- 
ing, floating musical staffs that ex- 
truded themselves from the spot like 
parallel strands of spider web. 

The people who ran Pearly Gates 
were a barrel of laughs. All the ac- 
tual structures that made up the 
above-ground parts of the settlement 
were disguised behind whimsical 
holographic projections. The whole 
place looked like a cross between a 
ehild’s candy-land nightmare and an 
early Walt Disney cartoon. 

Dominating the town was a giant 

5 



GOHA SING, GOTTA DANCE 




calliope with pipes a thousand me- 
ters tall. There were fifteen of them, 
and they all were bouncing and 
swaying in time to the saxophone 
music. They would squat down as if 
taking a deep breath, then stand up 
again, emitting a colored smoke 
ring. The buildings, which Bamum 
knew were actually functional, unin- 
teresting hemispheres, appeared to 
be square houses with flowerboxes 
in the windows and cartoon eyes 
peering out the doors. They trem- 
bled and jigged as if they were 
made of jello. 

“Don’t you think it’s a trifle 
overdone?’’ Bailey asked. 

“Depends on what you like. It’s 
kind of cute, in its own gaudy 
way.” 

They drifted in through the 
spaghetti maze of lines, bars, six- 
teenth notes, rests, smoke rings, 
and blaring music. They plowed 
through an insubstantial eighth-note 
run, and Bailey killed their remain- 
ing velocity with the jets. They 
lighted softly in the barely percepti- 
ble gravity and made their way to 
one of the grinning buildings. 

^ * ir 

Coming up to the entrance of the 
building had been quite an experi- 
ence. Barnum had reached for a 
button marked LOCK CYCLE and 
it had dodged out of his way, then 
turned into a tiny face, leering at 
him. Practical joke. The lock had 
opened anyway, actuated by his 



presence. Inside, Pearly Gates was 
not so flamboyant. The corridors 
looked decently like corridors, and 
the floors were solid and gray. 

“I’d watch out, all the same,” 
Bailey advised, darkly. “These 
people are real self-panickers. Their 
idea of a good laugh might be to 
dig a hole in the floor and cover it 
with a holo. Watch your step.” 

“Aw, don’t be such a sore loser. 
You could spot something like that, 
couldn’t you?” 

Bailey didn’t answer, and Bar- 
num didn’t pursue it. He knew the 
source of the symb’s uneasiness and 
dislike of the station on Janus. 
Bailey wanted to get their business 
over as soon as possible and get 
back to the Ring, where he felt 
needed. Here, in a corridor filled 
with oxygen, Bailey was physically 
useless. 

Bailey’s function in the symbiotic 
team of Bamum and Bailey was to 
provide an environment of food, 
oxygen, and water for the human, 
Barnum. Conversely, Barnum pro- 
vided food, carbon dioxide, and 
water for Bailey. Barnum was a 
human, physically unremarkable ex- 
cept for a surgical alteration of his 
knees that made them bend outward 
rather than forward, and the over- 
sized hands, called peds, that grew 
out of his ankles where his feet 
used to be. Bailey, on the other 
hand, was nothing like a human. 

Strictly speaking, Bailey was not 
even a he. Bailey was a plant, and 
Bamum thought of him as a male 



6 



GALAXY 




only because the voice in his head 
that was Bailey’s only means of 
communication sounded masculine. 
He had no shape of his own. He 
existed by containing Barnum and 
taking on part of his shape. He ex- 
tended into Barnum’s alimentary 
canal, in the mouth and all the way 
through to emerge at the anus, 
threading him like a needle. To- 
gether, the team looked like a 
human in a featureless spacesuit, 
with a bulbous head, a tight waist, 
and swollen hips. A ridiculously 
exaggerated female, if you wish. 

“You might as well start breath- 
ing again,’’ Bailey said. 

“What for? I will when I need to 
talk to someone who’s not paired 
with a symb. In the meantime, why 
bother?’’ 

“I just thought you’d like to get 
used to it.’’ 

“Oh, very well. If you think it’s 
necessary.’’ 

So Bailey gradually withdrew the 
parts of him that filled Barnum’s 
lungs and throat, freeing his speech 
apparatus to do what it hadn’t done 
for over ten years. Bamum coughed 
as the air flowed into his throat. It 
was cold! Well, it felt like it, 
though it was actually at the stan- 
dard 72 degrees. He was unused to 
it. His diaphragm gave one shudder, 
then took over the chore of breath- 
ing as if his medulla had never 
been disconnected. 

“There,” he said aloud, sur- 
prised at how his voice sounded. 
“Satisfied?” 



“It never hurts to do a little test- 
ing.” 

“Let’s get this out in the open, 
shall we? I didn’t want to come 
here any more than you did, but 
you know we had to. Are you going 
to give me trouble about it until we 
leave? We’re supposed to be a 
team, remember?” 

There was a mental sigh from his 
partner. 

“I’m sorry, but that’s just it. We 
are supposed to be a team, and out 
in the Ring we are. Neither of us is 
anything without the other. Here 
I’m just something you have to 
carry around. I can’t walk, I can’t 
talk; I’m revealed as the vegetable 
that I am.” 

Barnum was accustomed to the 
symb’s periodic attacks of inse- 
curity. In the Ring they never 
amounted to much. But when they 
entered a gravitational field Bailey 
was reminded of how ineffectual a 
being he was. 

“Here yoU can breathe on your 
own,” Bailey went on. “You could 
see on your own if I uncovered 
your eyes. By the way, do 
you ...” 

“Don’t be silly. Why should I 
use my own eyes when you can 
give me a better picture than I could 
on my own?” 

“In the Ring, that’s true. But 
here all my extra senses are just ex- 
cess mass. What good is an ad- 
justed velocity display to you here? 
The farthest thing I can sense is 
twenty meters off, and stationary.”

“Listen you. Do you want to turn 
around and march back out that 
lock? We can. I’ll do it if this is 
going to be such a trauma for you.” 

There was a long silence, and 
Barnum was flooded with a warm, 
apologetic sensation that left him 
weak at his splay ed-out knees. 

“There’s no need to apologize,” 
he went on in a more sympathetic 
tone. “I understand you. This is 
just something we have to do to- 
gether, like everything else, the 
good along with the bad.” 

“I love you, Barnum.” 

“And you, silly.” 

ir ^ it 

The sign on the door read: 
TYMPANI & RAGTIME 
TINPANALLEYCATS 

Barnum and Bailey hesitated out- 
side the door. 

“What are you supposed to do, 
knock?” Barnum asked out loud. 
“It’s been so long I’ve forgotten 
how.” 

“Just fold your fingers into a fist 
and . .” 

“Not that.” He laughed, dispell- 
ing his momentary nervousness. 
“I’ve forgotten the politenesses of 
human society. Well, they do it in 
all the tapes I ever saw.” He 
knocked on the door and it opened 
by itself on the second rap. 

There was a man sitting behind a 
desk with his bare feet propped up 
on it. Barnum had been prepared 
for the shock of seeing another hu- 



man, one who was not enclosed in 
a symb, for he had encountered 
several of them on the way to the 
offices of Tympani and Ragtime. 
But he was still reeling from the un- 
familiarity of it. The man seemed to 
realize it and silently gestured him 
to a chair. He sat down in it, think- 
ing that in the low gravity it really 
wasn’t necessary. But somehow he 
was grateful. The man didn’t say 
anything for a long while, giving 
Barnum time to settle down and ar- 
range his thoughts. He spent the 
time looking the man over care- 
fully. 

Several things were apparent 
about him; most blatently, he was 
not a fashionable man. Shoes had 
been virtually extinct for over a cen- 
tury for the simple reason that there 
was nothing to walk on but padded 
floors. However, current fashion 
decreed that Shoes Are Worn. 

The man was young-looking, 
having halted his growth at around 
twenty years. He was dressed in a 
holo-suit, a generated illusion of 
flowing color that refused to stay in 
one spot or take on a definite form. 
Other than that, he might well have 
been nude, but Barnum couldn’t 
tell. 

“You’re Barnum and Bailey, 
right?” the man said. 

“Yes. And you’re Tympani?” 

“Ragtime. Tympani will be here 
later. I’m pleased to meet you. 
Have any trouble on the way down? 
This is your first visit, I think you 
said.”

GALAXY 




“Yes, it is. No trouble. And 
thank you, incidentally, for the 
ferry fee.” 

He waved it away. “Don’t con- 
cern yourself. It’s all in the over- 
head. We’re taking a chance that 
you’ll be good enough to repay that 
many times over. We’re right 
enough times that we don’t lose 
money on it. Most of your people 
out there don’t have the money to 
afford being landed on Janus, and 
then where would we be? We’d have 
to go out to you. Cheaper this 
way.” 

“I suppose it is.” He was silent 
again. He noticed that his throat 
was beginning to get sore with the 
unaccustomed effort of talking. No 
sooner had the thought been formed 
than he felt Bailey go into action. 
The internal tendril that had been 
withdrawn flicked up out of his 
stomach and lubricated his larynx. 
The pain died away as the nerve 
endings were suppressed. It’s all in 
your head, anyway, he told himself. 

“Who recommended us to you?” 

“Who . oh, it was . who 
was it, Bailey?” He realized too' 
late that he had spoken it aloud. He 
hadn’t wanted to, he had a vague 
feeling that it might be impolite to 
speak to his symb that way. Rag- 
time wouldn’t hear the answer, of 
course. 

“It was Antigone,” Bailey 
supplied. 

“Thanks,” Bamum said, silently 
this time. “A man named Anti- 
gone,” he told Ragtime. 

GOHA SING, GOHA DANCE 



The man made a note of that, and 
looked up again, smiling. 

“Well now. What is it you 
wanted to show us?” 

Barnum was about to describe 
their work to Ragtime when the 
door burst open and a woman sailed 
in. She sailed in the literal sense, 
banking off the door-jamb, grabbing 
at the door with her left ped and 
slamming it shut in one smooth mo- 
tion, then spinning in the air to kiss 
the floor with the tips of her fin- 
gers, using them to slow her speed 
until she was stopped in front of the 
desk, leaning over it and talking ex- 
citedly to Ragtime. Barnum was 
surprised that she had peds instead 
of feet, thinking that no one used 
them in Pearly Gates. They made 
walking awkward. But she didn’t 
seem interested in walking. 

“Wait till you hear what Myers 
has done now!” she said, almost 
levitating in her enthusiasm. Her 
ped-fingers worked in the carpet as 
she talked. “He re-aligned the sen- 
sors in the right anterior ganglia, 
and you won’t believe what it does 
to the . .” 

“We have a client, Tympani.” 
She turned and saw the symb- 
human pair sitting behind her. She 
put her hand to her mouth as if to 
hush herself, but she was smiling 
behind it. She moved over to 
them — it couldn’t be called walking 
in the low gravity; she seemed to 
accomplish it by perching on two 
fingers of each of her peds and 
walking on them, which made it 

9 




look like she was floating. She 
reached them and extended her 
hand. 

She was wearing a holo suit like 
Ragtime’s but instead of wearing 
the projector around her waist, as 
he did, she had it mounted on a 
ring. When she extended her hand, 
the holo generator had to compen- 
sate by weaving larger and thinner 
webs of light around her body. It 
looked like an explosion of pastels, 
and left her body barely covered. 
What Barnum saw could have been 
a girl of sixteen; lanky, thin hips 
and breasts and two blonde braids 
that reached to her waist. But her 
movements belied that. There was 
no adolescent awkwardness there. 

‘Tm Tympani,” she said, taking 
his hand. Bailey was taken by sur- 
prise and didn’t know whether to 
bare the hand or not. So what she 
grasped was Bamum’s hand covered 
by the three-centimeter padding of 
Bailey. She didn’t seem to mind. 

“You must be Barnum and 
Bailey. Do you know who the orig- 
inal Barnum and Bailey were?” 
“Yes, they’re the people who 
built your big calliope outside.” 

She laughed. “The place is a 
kind of a circus, until you get used 
to it. Rag tells me you have some- 
thing to sell us.” 

“I hope so.” 

“You’ve come to the right place. 
Rag’s the business side of the com- 
pany; I’m the talent. So I’m the one 
you’ll be selling to. I don’t suppose 
you have anything written down?” 

10 



He n^de a wry face, then re- 
membered she couldn’t see anything 
but a blank stretch of green with a 
hole for his mouth. It took some 
time to get used to dealing with 
people again. 

“I don’t even know how to read 
music.” 

She sighed, but didn’t seem un- 
happy. “I figured as much. So few 
of you Ringers do. Honestly, if I i 
could ever figure out what it is that 
turns you people into artists I could 
get rich.” 

“The only way to do that is to go 
out in the Ring and see for your- 
self.” 

“Right,” she said, a little embar- , 
rassed. She looked away from the 
misshapen thing sitting in the chair. 
The only way to discover the magic 
of a life in the Ring was to go out 
there, and the only way to do that 
was to adopt a symb. Forever give 
up your individuality and become a 
part of a team. Not many people 
could do that. 

“We might as well get started,” 
she said, standing and patting her 
thighs to cover her nervousness. 
“The practice room is through that i 
door.” 

He followed her in, to a dimly lit \ 
room that seemed to be half buried | 
in paper. He hadn’t realized that 
any business could require so much 
paper. Their policy seemed to be to 
stack it up and when the stack got 
too high and tumbled into a land- 
slide, kick it back into a corner. 
Sheets of music crunched under his 



GAUXY i 




peds as he followed her to the 
comer of the room where the syn- 
thesizer keyboard stood beneath a 
lamp. The rest of the room was in 
shadows, but the keys gleamed 
brightly in their ancient array of 
black and white. 

Tympani took off her ring and sat 
at the keyboard. “The damn holo 
gets in my way,” she explained. “I 
can’t see the keys.” Barnum 
noticed for the first time that there 
was another keyboard on the floor, 
down in the shadows, and her peds 
were poised over it. He wondered if 
that was the only reason she wore 
them. Having seen her walk, he 
doubted it. 

She sat still for a moment, then 
looked over to him expectantly. 

“Tell me about it,” she said in a 
whisper. 

He didn’t know what to say. 

“Tell you about it? Just tell 
you?” 

She laughed, and relaxed again, 
hands in her lap. 

“I was kidding. But we have to 
get the music out of your head and 
onto that tape some way. How 
would you prefer? I heard that a 
Beethoven Symphony was once 
written out in English, each chord 
and run described in detail. I can’t 
imagine why anyone would want to, 
but someone did. It made quite a 
thick book. We can do it that way. 
Or surely you can think of 
another.” He was silent. Until she 
sat at the keyboard, he hadn’t really 
thought about that part of it. He 

GOHA SING, GOHA DANCE 



knew his music, knew it to the last 
hemi-semi-demi-quaver. How to get 
it out? 

“What’s the first note?” she 
prompted. 

He was ashamed again. “I don’t 
even know the names of the notes,” 
he confessed. 

She was not surprised. “Sing it.” 

“I ... I’ve never tried to sing 
it.” 

“Try now.” She sat up straight, 
looking at him with a friendly 
smile, not coaxing but encouraging. 

“I can hear it,” he said, desper- 
ately. “Every note, every disso- 
nance ... is that the right word?” 

She grinned. “It’s a right word, 
but I don’t know if you know what 
it means. It’s the quality of sound 
produced when the vibrations don’t 
mesh harmoniously: J/5chord, it 
doesn’t produce a sonically pleasing 
chord. Like this:” and she pressed 
two keys close together, tried sev- 
eral others, then played with the 
knobs mounted over the keyboard 
until the two notes were only a few 
vibrations apart and wavered sinu- 
ously. “They don’t automatically 
please the ear, but in the right con- 
text they can make you sit up and 
take notice. Is your music discor- 
dant?” 

“Some places. Is that bad?” 

“Not at all. Used right, 
it’s . well, not pleasing 
exactly . .” she spread her arms 
helplessly. “Talking about music is 
a pretty frustrating business, at best. 
Singing’s much friendlier. Are you 

11 




going to sing for me, love, or must 
I try to wade through your descrip- 
tions?” 

Hesitantly, he sang the first three 
notes of his piece, knowing that 
they sounded nothing like the or- 
chestra that crashed through his 
head but desperate to try something. 
She took it up, playing the three 
unmodulated tones on the syn- 
thesizer; three pure sounds that were 
pretty, but lifeless and light-years 
away from what he wanted. 

‘‘No, no, it has to be richer.” 

‘‘All right. I’ll play what I think 
of as richer, and we’ll see if we 
speak the same language.” She 
turned some knobs and played the 
three notes again, this time giving 
them the modulations of a string 
bass. 

‘‘That’s closer. But it’s still not 
there.” 

‘‘Don’t despair,” she said, wav- 
ing her hand at the bank of dials be- 
fore her. ‘‘Each of these will pro- 
duce a different effect, singly or in 
combination. I’m reliably informed 
that the permutations are infinite. 
So somewhere in there we’ll find 
your tune. Now. Which way should 
we go; this way, or this way?” 

Twisting the knob she touched in 
one direction made the sound be- 
come tinnier; the other, brassier, 
with a hint of trumpets. 

He sat up. That was getting 
closer still, but it lacked the rich- 
ness of the sounds in his brain. He 
had her turn the knob back and 
forth, finally settled on the place 

12 



that most nearly approached his 
phantom tune. She tried another 
knob, and the result was a still 
closer approach. But it lacked some- 
thing. 

Getting more and more involved, 
Barnum found himself standing over 
her shoulder as she tried another 
knob. That was closer still, but . 

Feverishly, he sat beside her on 
the bench and reached out for the 
knob. He tuned it carefully, then 
realized what he had done. 

‘‘Do you mind?” he asked. ‘‘It’s 
so much easier sitting here and turn- 
ing them myself.” 

She slapped him on the shoulder. 
‘‘You dope,” she laughed. ‘‘I’ve 
been trying to get you over here for 
the last fifteen minutes. Do you 
think I could really do this by my- 
self? That Beethoven story was a 
lie.” 

‘‘What will we do, then?” 

‘‘What you’ll do is fiddle with 
this machine, with me here to help 
you and tell you how to get what 
you want. When you get it right. 
I’ll play it for you. Believe me. I’ve 
done this too many times to think 
you could sit over there and de- 
scribe it to me. Now sing!” 

He sang. Eight hours later Rag- 
time came quietly into the room and 
put a plate of sandwiches and a pot 
of coffee on the table beside them. 
Barnum was still singing, and the 
synthesizer was singing along with 
him. 

* * * 



GAIAXY 




Barnum came swimming out of 
his creative fog, aware that some- 
thing was hovering in his field of 
vision, interfering with his view of 
the keyboard. Something white and 
steaming, at the end of a long . 

It was a coffe cup, held in Tym- 
pani’s hand. He looked at her face 
and she tactfully said nothing. 

While working at the synthesizer 
Barnum and Bailey had virtually 
fused into a single being. That was 
appropriate, since the music Bar- 
num was trying Jo sell was the pro- 
duct of their joint mind. It belonged 
to both of them. Now he wrenched 
himself away from his partner, far 
enough away that talking to him be- 
came a little more than talking to 
himself. 

“How about it, Bailey? Should 
we have some?” 

“I don’t see why not. I’ve had to 
expend quite a bit of water vapor to 
keep you cool in this place. It could 
stand replenishing.” 

“Listen, why don’t you roll back 
from my hands? It would make it 
easier to handle those controls; give 
me finer manipulation, see? Be- 
sides, I’m not sure if it’s polite to 
shake hands with her without actu- 
ally touching flesh.” 

Bailey said nothing, but his fluid 
body drew quickly back from Bar- 
num’s hands. He reached out and 
took the offered cup, starting at the 
unfamiliar sensation of heat in his 
own nerve endings. Tympani was un- 
aware of the discussion; it had taken 
only a second. 

GOHA SING, GOHA DANCE 



The sensation was explosive 
when it went down his throat. He 
gasped, and Tympani looked wor- 
ried. 

“Take it easy there, friend. 
You’ve got to get your nerves back 
in shape for something as hot as 
that.” She took a careful sip and 
turned back to the keyboard. Bar- 
num set his cup down and joined 
her. But it seemed like time for a 
recess and he couldn’t get back into 
it. She recognized it and relaxed, 
taking a sandwich and eating it like 
she was starving. 

“She is starving, you dope,’’ 
Bailey said. “Or at least very hun- 
gry. She hasn’t had anything to eat 
for eight hours, and she doesn’t have 
a symb re-cycling her wastes into 
food and dripping it into her veins. 
So she gets hungry. Remember?” 

“I remember. I’d forgotten.” He 
looked at the pile of sandwiches. “I 
wonder what it would feel like to 
eat one of those?” 

“Like this.’’ Barnum’s mouth 
was flooded with the taste of a tuna 
salad sandwich on whole wheat. 
Bailey produced this trick, like all 
his others, by direct stimulation of 
the sensorium. With no trouble at 
all he could produce completely 
new sensations simply by shorting 
one sector of Barnum’s brain into 
another. If Barnum wanted to know 
what the taste of a tuna sandwich 
sounded like, Bailey could let him 
hear. 

“All right. And I won’t protest 
that I didn’t feel the bite of it 

13 




against my teeth, because I know 
you can produce that, too. And all 
the sensations of chewing and swal- 
lowing it, and much more besides. 
Still,” and his thoughts took on a 
tone that Bailey wasn’t sure he 
liked,” I wonder if it would be the 
polite thing to eat one of them?” 

“What’s all this politeness all of 
a sudden?” Bailey exploded. “Eat 
it if you like, but I’ll never know 
why. Be a carnivorous animal and 
see if I care.” 

‘‘Temper, temper,” Barnum 
chidedr with tenderness in his 
voice. “Settle down, chum. I’m not 
going anywhere without you. But 
we have to get along with these 
people. I’m just trying to be dip- 
lomatic.” 

“Eat it, then,” Bailey sighed. 
“You’ll min my ecology schedules 
• for months — what’ll I do with all 
that extra protein? — but why should 
you care about that?” 

Barnum laughed silently. He 
knew that Bailey could do anything 
he liked with it: ingest it, refine it, 
burn it, or simply contain it and 
expel it at the first opportunity. He 
reached for a sandwich and felt the 
thick substance of Bailey’s skin 
draw back from his face as he 
raised it to his mouth. 

He had expected a brighter light, 
but he shouldn’t have. He was 
using his own retinas to see with for 
the first time in years, but it was no 
different from the cortex-induced 
pictures Bailey had shown him all 
that time. 



“You have a nice face,” Tym- 
pani said, around a mouthful of 
sandwich. ‘‘I thought you would 
have. You painted a very nice pic- 
ture of yourself.” 

“I did?” Barnum asked, in- 
trigued. “What do you mean?” 
“Your music. It reflects you. Oh, 
I don’t see everything in your eyes 
that I saw in the music, but I never 
do. The rest of it is Bailey, your 
friend. And I can’t read his expres- 
sion.” 

“No, I guess you couldn’t. But 
can you tell anything about him?’ ’ 
She thought about it, then turned 
to the keyboard. She picked out a 
theme they had worried out a few 
hours before, played it a little faster 
and with subtle alterations in the to- 
nality. It was a happy fragment, 
with a hint of something just out of 
reach. 

‘‘That’s Bailey. He’s worried 
about something. If experience is 
any guide, it’s being here at Pearly 
Gates. Symbs don’t like to come 
here, or anywhere there’s gravity. It 
makes them feel not needed.” 

“Hear that?” he asked his silent 
partner. 

“Umm.” 

“And that’s so silly,” she went 
on. “I don’t know about it first- 
hand, obviously, but I’ve met and 
talked to a lot of Pairs. As far as I 
can see, the bond between a human 
and a symb is . well, it makes a 
mother cat dying to defend her kit- 
tens seem like a case of casual af- 
fection. I guess you know that bet- 



14 



GALAXY 




ter than I could ever say, though.” 

“You stated it well,” he said. 

Bailey made a grudging sign of 
approval, a mental sheepish grin. 
“She’s out-pointed me, meat-eater. 
I’ll shut up and let you two talk 
without me intruding my baseless 
insecurities.” 

“You relaxed him,” Barnum told 
her, happily. “You’ve even got him 
making jokes about himself. That’s 
no small accomplishment, because 
he takes himself pretty seriously.” 

“That’s not fair, I can’t defend 
myself.” 

“I thought you were going to be 
quiet?” 

* 

The work proceeded smoothly, 
though running longer than Bailey 
would have liked. After three days 
of transcribing, the music was be- 
ginning to take ^hape. A time came 
when Tympani could a press a but- 
ton and have the machine play it 
back, much more than the skeletal 
outline they had evolved on the first 
day but still needing finishing 
touches. 

“How about ‘Contrapunctual 
Cantata’?” Tympani asked. 

“What?” 

“For a title. It has to have a title. 
I’ve been thinking about it, and 
coined that word. It fits, because 
the piece is very metrical in con- 
struction: tight, on-time, on the 
beat. Yet it has a strong counter- 
point in the woodwinds.” 

GOHA SING, GOHA DANCE 



“That’s the reedy sections, 
right?” 

“Yes. What do you think?” 
“Bailey wants to know what a 
cantata is.” 

Tympani shrugged her shoulders, 
but looked guilty. “To tell you the 
truth, I stuck that in for alliteration. 
Maybe as a selling point. Actually, 
a cantata is sung, and you don’t 
have anything like voices in this. 
You sure you couldn’t work some 
in?” 

Barnum considered it. “No.” 
“It’s your decision, of course.” 
She seemed about to say something 
else but decided against it. 

“Look, 1 don’t care too much 
about the title,” Barnum said. 
“Will it help you to sell it, naming 
it that?” 

“Might.” 

“Then do as you please.” 
“Thanks. I’ve got Rag working 
on some preliminary publicity. We 
both think this has possibilities. He 
liked the title, and he’s pretty good 
at knowing what will sell. He likes 
the piece, too.” 

“How much longer before we’ll 
have it ready?” 

“Not too long. Two more days. 
Are you getting tired of it?” 

“A little. I’d like to get back to 
the Ring. So would Bailey.” 

She frowned at him, pouting her 
lower lip. “That means I won’t be 
seeing you for ten years. This sure 
can be a slow business. It takes 
forever to develop new talent.” 
“Why are you in it?” 

15 




She thought about it. “I guess 
because music is what I like, and 
Janus is where the most innovative 
music in the system is born and 
bred. No one else can compete with 
your Ringers.” 

He was about to ask her why she 
didn’t pair up and see what it was 
like, first-hand. But something held 
him back; some unspoken taboo she 
had set up, or perhaps it was him. 
Truthfully, he could no longer un- 
derstand why everyone didn’t pair 
with a symb. It seemed the only 
sane way to live. But he knew that 
many found the idea unattractive; 
even repugnant. 

After the fourth recording session 
Tympani relaxed by playing the 
synthesizer for the Pair. They had 
known she was good, and their 
opinion was confirmed by the artist- 
ry she displayed at the keyboard. 

Tympani had made a study of 
musical history. She could play 
Bach or Beethoven as easily as the 
works of the modern composers like 
Bamum. She performed Beethoven’s 
Eighth Symphony, first movement. 
With her two hands and two peds 
she had no trouble at all in making 
an exact reproduction of a full sym- 
phony orchestra. But she didn’t 
limit herself to that. The music 
would segue imperceptibly from the 
traditional strings into the concrete 
sounds that only an electronic in- 
strument could produce. 

She followed it with something 
by Ravel that Barnum had never 
heard, then an early composition by 



Riker. After that, she amused him 
with some Joplin rags and a march 
by John Philip Sousa. She allowed 
herself no license on these, playing 
them with the exact instrumentation 
indicated by the composer. 

Then she moved directly into 
another march. This one was incred- 
ibly lively, full of chromatic runs 
that soared and swooped. She 
played it with a precision in the 
bass parts that the old musicians 
could never have achieved. Barnum 
was reminded of old films seen as a 
child, films full of snarling lions in 
cages and elephants bedecked with 
feathers. 

“What was that?” he asked when 
she was through. 

“Funny you should ask, Mr. 
Barnum. That was an old circus 
march called ‘Thunder and Blazes.’ 
Or some call it ‘Entry of the 
Gladiators.’ There’s some confusion 
among the scholars. Some say it 
had a third title, ‘Barnum and 
Bailey’s Favorite,’ but the majority 
think that was another one. If it 
was, it’s lost, and too bad. But ev- 
eryone is sure that Barnum and 
Bailey liked this one, too. What do 
you think of it?” 

“I like it. Would you play it 
again?” 

She. did, and a third time later, 
because Bailey wanted to be sure it 
was safe in Barnum’s memory 
where they could replay it later. 

Tympani turned the machine off 
and rested her elbows on the 
keyboard.

GALAXY 




“When you go back out,” she 
said, “Why don’t you give some 
thought to working in a synapticon 
part for your next work?” 

“What’s a synapticon?” 

She stared at him, not believing 
what she had heard. Then her ex- 
pression changed to one of delight. 

“You really don’t know? Then 
you have something to learn.” And 
she bounced over to her desk, grab- 
bed something with her peds, and 
hopped back to the synthesizer. It 
was a small black -box with a strap 
and a wire with an input jack at one 
end. She turned her back to him 
and parted her hair at the base of 
her skull. 

“Will you plug me in?” she 
asked. 

Bamum saw the tiny gold socket 
buried in her hair, the kind that en- 
abled one to interface directly with 
a computer. He inserted the plug 
into it and she strapped the box 
around her neck. It was severely 
funtional, and had an improvised, 
breadboarded look about it, scarred 
with tool marks and chipped paint. 
It gave the impression of having 
been tinkered with almost daily. 

“It’s still in the development 
process,” she said. “Myers — he’s 
the guy who invented it — has been 
playing with it, adding things. 
When we get it right we’ll market it 
as a necklace. The circuitry can be 
compacted quite a bit. The first one 
had a wire that connected it to the 
speaker, which hampered my style 
considerably. But this one has a 

GOTTA SING, GOHA DANCE 



transmitter. You’ll see what I mean. 
Come on, there isn’t room in 
here.” 

She led the way back to the outer 
office and turned on a big speaker 
against the wall. 

What it does,” she said, standing 
in the middle of the room with her 
hands at her sides, “is translate 
body motion into music. It mea- 
sures the tensions in the body nerve 
network, amplifies them, 
and . .well. I’ll show you what I 
mean. This position is null; no 
sound is produced.” She was stand- 
ing straight, but relaxed, peds to- 
gether, hands at her sides, head 
slightly lowered. 

She brought her arm up in front 
of her, reaching with her hand, and 
the speaker behind her made a 
swooping sound up the scale, break- 
ing into a chord as her fingers 
closed on the invisible tone in the 
air. She bent her knee forward and 
a soft bass note crept in, strengthen- 
ing as she tensed the muscles in her 
thighs. 

She added more harmonics with 
her other hand, then abruptly cocked 
her body to one side, exploding 
the sound into a cascade of chords. 
Barnum sat up straight, the hairs 
on his arms and spine sitting up with 
him. 

Tympani couldn’t see him. She 
was lost in a world that existed 
slightly out of phase with the real 
one, a world where dance was 
music and her body was the instru- 
ment. Her eyeblinks became 

17 




stacatto punctuating phrases and her 
breathing provided a solid rhythmic 
base for the nets of sound her arms 
and legs and fingers were weaving. 

The beauty of it to Barnum and 
Bailey was the perfect fitting to- 
gether of movement to sound. He 
had thought it would be just a 
novelty: sweating to twist her body 
into shapes that were awkward and 
unnatural to reach the notes she was 
after. But it wasn’t like that. Each 
element shaped the other. Both the 
music and the dance were impro- 
vised as she went along and were 
subordinate to no rules but her own 
internal ones. 

When she finally came to rest, 
balancing on the tips of her peds 
and letting the sound die away to 
nothingness, Barnum was almost 
numb. And he was surprised to hear 
the sound of hands clapping. He 
realized it was his own hands, but 
he wasn’t clapping them. It was 
Bailey. Bailey had never taken over 
motor control. 

it ir it 

They had to have all the details. 
Bailey was overwhelmed by the 
new art form and grew so impatient 
with relaying questions through 
Barnum that he almost asked to take 
over Barnum’s vocal cords for a 
while. 

Tympani was surprised at the de- 
gree of enthusiasm. She was a 
strong proponent of the synapticon 
but had not met much success in 
her efforts to popularize it. It had 

18 



its limitations, and was viewed as 
an interesting but passing fad. 

“What limitations?’’ Bailey 
asked, and Barnum vocalized. 

“Basically, it needs free-fall per- 
formance to be fully effective. 
There are residual tones that can’t 
be eliminated when you’re standing 
up in gravity, even on Janus. And I 
can’t stay in the air long enough 
here. You evidently didn’t notice it, 
but I was unable to introduce many 
variations under those conditions.” 
Barnum saw soinething at once. 
“Then I should have one installed. 
That way I can play it as I move 
through the Ring.” 

Tympani brushed a strand of hair 
out of her eyes. She was covered in 
sweat from her performance, and 
her face was flushed. Barnum almost 
didn’t hear her reply, he was so 
intent on the harmony of motion 
in that simple movement. And the 
synapticon was turned off. 

‘‘Maybe you should. But I’d wait 
if I were you.” Barnum was about 
to ask why but she went on quickly. 
“It isn’t an exact instrument yet, 
but we’re working on it, refining it 
every day. Part of the problems, 
you see, is that it takes special 
training to operate it so it produces 
more than white noise. I wasn’t 
strictly truthful with you when I 
told you how it works.” 

“How so?” 

“Well, I said it measures ten- 
sions in nerves and translates it. 
Where are most of the nerves in the 
body?” 



GALAXY 




Barnum saw it then. “In the 
brain.” 

“Right. So mood is even more 
important in this than in most mu- 
sic. Have you ever worked with an 
alpha-wave device? By listening to 
a tone you can control certain func- 
tions of your brain. It takes prac- 
tice. The brain provides the reser- 
voir of tone for the synapticon, 
modulates the whole composition. If 
you aren’t in control of it, it comes 
out as noise.” 

“How long have you been work- 
ing with it?” 

“About three years.” 

* * * 

While Bamum and Bailey were 
working with her, Tympani had to 
adjust her day and night cycles to 
fit with his biological processes. 
The Pair spent the periods of sun- 
light stretched out in Janus’ munici- 
pal kitchen. 

The kitchen was a free service 
provided by the community, one 
that was well worth the cost, since 
without it paired humans would find 
it impossible to remain on Janus 
for more than a few days. It was a 
bulldozed plain, three kilometers 
square, marked off in a grid with 
sections one hundred meters on an 
edge. Bamum didn’t care for it — 
none of the Pairs liked it much — but 
it was the best they could do in a 
gravity field. 

No closed ecology is truly closed. 
The same heat cannot be re-used 
endlessly as raw materials can. Heat 

GOHA SING, GOTTA DANCE 



must be added, energy must be 
pumped in somewhere along the 
line to enable the plant component 
of the cycle to synthesize the car- 
bohydrates needed by the animal 
component. Bailey could use some 
of the low-level heat generated 
when Barnum’s body broke down 
these molecules, but that process 
would soon lead to ecological bank- 
ruptcy. 

The symb solution was photosyn- 
thesis, like any other plant, though 
the chemicals Bailey employed for 
it bore only a vague resemblance to 
chlorophyl. Photosynthesis requires 
large amounts of plant surface, 
much more than is available on an 
area the size of a human. And the 
intensity of sunlight at Saturn’s 
orbit was only one hundredth what 
it was at Earth. 

Barnum walked carefully, along 
one of the white lines of the grid. 
To his left and right, humans were 
reclining in the centers of the large 
squares. They were enclosed in only 
the thinnest coating of symb; the 
rest of the symb’s mass was spread 
in a sheet of living film, almost in- 
visible except as a sheen on the flat 
ground. In space, this sunflower 
was formed by spinning slowly and 
letting centrigugal force form the 
large parabolic organ. Here it lay 
inert on the ground, pulled out by 
mechanical devices at the comers of 
the square. Symbs did not have the 
musculature to do it themselves. 

No part of their stay on Janus 
made them yearn for the Rings as 

19 




much as the kitchen. Barnum re- 
clined in the middle of an empty 
square and let the mechanical claws 
fit themselves to Bailey’s outer 
tegument. They began to pull, 
slowly, and Bailey was stretched. 

In the Ring they were never more 
than ten kilometers from the Upper 
Half. They could drift up there and 
deploy the sunflower, dream away a 
few hours, then use the light pres- 
sure to push them back into the 
shaded parts of the Ring. It was 
nice; it was not exactly sleep, not 
exactly anything in human experi- 
ence. It was plant consciousness, a 
dreamless, simple awareness of the 
universe, unemcumbered with 
thought processes. 

Barnum grumbled now as the 
sunflower was spread on the ground 
around them. Though the energy- 
intake phase of their existence was 
not sleep, several days of trying to 
accomplish it in a gravity well left 
Barnum with symptoms very like 
lack of sleep. They were both get- 
ting irritable. They were eager to re- 
turn to weightlessness. 

He felt the pleasant lethargy 
creep over him. Beneath him, 
Bailey was extending powerful root- 
lets into the naked rock, using acid 
compounds to eat into it and obtain 
the small amounts of replacement 
mass the Pair needed. 

“So when are we going?” Bailey 
asked, quietly. 

“Any day, now. Any day.” Bar- 
num was drowsy. He could feel the 
sun starting to heat the fluid in 

20 



Bailey’s sunflower. He was like a 
daisy nodding lazily in a green pas- 
ture. 

“I guess I don’t need to point it 
out, but the trascription is complete. 
There’s no need for us to stay.” 

“I know.” 

* * * 

That night Tympani danced 
again. She made it slow, with none 
of the flying leaps and swelling 
crescendos of the first time. And 
slowly, almost imperceptibly, a 
theme crept in. It was changed, 
rearranged; it was a run here and a 
phrase there. It never quite became 
melodic, as it was on the tape, but 
that was only right. It had been 
scored for strings, brass, and many 
other instruments but they hadn’t 
written in a tympani part. She had 
to transpose for her instrument. It 
was still contrapunctual. 

When she was done she told 
them of her most successful con- 
cert, the one that had almost cap- 
tured the public fancy. It had been a 
duet; she and her partner playing 
the same synapticon while they 
made love. 

The first and second movements 
had been well-received. 

“Then we reached the finale,” 
she remembered, wryly, “and we 
suddenly lost sight of the harmonies 
and it sounded like, well, one re- 
viewer mentioned ‘the death 
agonies a hyena.’ I’m afraid we didn’t 
hear it.” 



GALAXY 




“Who was it? Ragtime?” 

She laughed. ‘‘Him? No, he 
doesn’t know anything about music. 
He makes love all right, but he 
couldn’t do it in 3/4 time. It was 
Myers, the guy who invented the 
synapticon. But he’s more of an en- 
gineer than a musician. I haven’t 
really found a good partner for that, 
and anyway, I wouldn’t do it in 
public again. Those reviews hurt.” 
“But I get the idea you feel the 
ideal conditions for making music 
with it would be a duet, in free-fall, 
while making love.” 

She snorted. “Did I say that?” 
She was quiet for a long time. 

“Maybe it is,” she finally con- 
ceded. She sighed. “The nature of 
the instrument is such that the most 
powerful music is made when the 
body is most in tune with its sur- 
roundings, and I can’t think of a bet- 
ter time than when I’m approaching 
an orgasm.” 

“Why didn’t it work, then?” 
“Maybe I shouldn’t say this, but 
Myers blew it. He got excited, 
which is the whole point, of course, 
but he couldn’t control it. There I 
was, tuned like a Stradivarius, feel- 
ing heavenly harps playing inside 
me, and he starts blasting out a 
jungle rhythm on a kazoo. I’m not 
going through that again. I’ll stick 
to the traditional ballet like I did to- 
night.” 

“Tympani,” Bamum blurted, “I 
could m^e love in 3/4 time.” 

She got up and paced around the 
room, looking at him from time to 

goha sing, goha dance 



time. He couldn’t see through her 
eyes, but felt uncomfortably aware 
that she saw a grotesque green blob 
with a human face set high up in a 
mass of putty. He felt a twinge of 
resentment for Bailey’s exterior. 
Why couldn’t she see himl He was 
in there, buried alive. For the first 
time he felt almost imprisoned. 
Bailey cringed away from the feel- 
ing. 

“Is that an invitation?” she 
asked. 

“Yes.” 

“But you don’t have a synapti- 
con. 

“Me and Bailey talked it over. 
He thinks he can function as one. 
After all, he does much the same 
thing every second of our lives. 
He’s very adept at rearranging nerve 
impulses, both in my brain and my 
body. He more or less lives in my 
nervous system.” 

She was momentarily speechless. 

“You say you can make mu- 
sic .. and hear it, without an in- 
strument at all? Bailey does this for 
you?” 

“Sure. We just hadn’t thought of 
routing body movements through 
the auditory part of the brain. 
That’s what you’re doing.” 

She opened her mouth to say 
something, then closed it again. She 
seemed undecided about what to do. 

“Tympani, why don’t you pair 
up and go out into the Ring? Wait a 
minute, hear us out. You told me 
that my music was great and you 
think it might even sell. How did I 

21 




do that? Do you ever think about 
it?” 

”1 think about it a lot,” she mut- 
tered, looking away from him. 

“When I came here I didn’t even 
know the names of the notes that 
were in my head. I was ignorant. I 
still don’t know much. But I write 
music. And you, you know more 
about music than anyone I ever met; 
you love it, you play it with beauty 
and skill. But what do you create?” 

“I’ve written things,” she said, 
defensively. “Oh, all right. They 
weren’t any good. I don’t seem to 
have the talent in that direction.” 

“But I’m proof that you don’t 
need it. I didn’t write that music; 
neither did Bailey. We watched it 
and listened to it, happening all 
around us. You can’t imagine what 
it’s like out there. It’s all the music 
you ever heard.”

At first consideration it seemed 
logical to many that the best art in 
the system should issue from the 
Rings of Saturn. Not until humanity 
reaches Beta Lyrae or farther will a 
more beautiful place to live be 
found. Surely an artist could draw 
endless inspiration from the sights 
to be seen in the Ring. But artists 
are rare. How could the Rings pro- 
duce art in every human who lived 
there? 

The artistic life of the solar sys- 
tem had been dominated by Ringers 
for over a century. If it was the re- 



sult of the heroic scale of the Rings 
and their superb beauty, one might 
expect the art produced to be 
mainly heroic in nature, and beauti- 
ful in tone and execution. Such had 
never been the case. The paintings, 
poetry, writing, and music of the 
Ringers covered the entire range of 
human experience and then went a 
step beyond. 

A man or a woman would arrive 
at Janus for any of a variety of 
reasons, determined to abandon his 
or her former life and pair with a 
symb. About a dozen of them de- 
parted like that each day, not to be 
heard of for up to a decade. These 
people were a reasonable cross- 
section of the race, ranging from 
the capable to the helpless, some of 
them kind and others cruel. There 
were geniuses among them, and 
idiots. They were precisely as 
young, old, sympathetic, callous, 
talented, useless, vulnerable and fal- 
lible as any random sample of hu- 
manity must be. Few of them had 
any training or inclination in the 
fields of painting or music or writ- 
ing. 

Some of them died. The Rings, 
after all, were hazardous. These 
people had no way of learning how 
to survive out there except by trying i 
and succeeding. But most came! 
back. And they came back with pic- j 
tures and songs and stories. 

Agentty was the only industry on 
Janus. It took a special kind of' 
agent, because few Ringers could 
walk into an office and present a 



22 



GALAXY 




finished work of any kind. A liter- 
ary agent had the easiest job. But a 
tinpanalleycat had to be ready to 
teach some rudiments of music to 
the composer who knew nothing 
about notation. 

The rewards were high. Ringer 
art was statistically about ten times 
more likely to sell than art from 
anywhere else in the system. Better 
yet, the agent took nearly all the 
profits instead of a commission, and 
the artists had never pressured for 
more. Ringers had little use for 
money. Often, an agent could retire 
on the proceeds of one successful 
sale. 

But the fundamental question of 
why Ringers produced art was un- 
answered. 

Barnum didn’t know. He had 
some ideas, partially confirmed by 
Bailey. It was tied up in the blend- 
ing of the human and symb mind. 
A Ringer was more than a human, 
and yet still human. When com- 
bined with a Symb something else 
was created. It was not under their 
control. The best Barnum had been 
able to express it to himself was by 
saying that this meeting of two dif- 
ferent kinds of mind set up a ten- 
sion at the Junction. It was like the 
addition of amplitudes when two 
waves meet head-on. That tension 
was mental, and fleshed itself out 
by clothing it.self in the symbols 
that were lying around for the tak- 
ing in the mind of the human. It 
had to be the human symbols be- 
cause the intellectual life of a symb 

gotta sing, goha dance 



starts at the moment it comes in 
contact with a human brain. The 
symb has no brain of its own and 
has to make do with using the 
human brain on a time-sharing 
basis.

They reached Tympani’s apart- 
ment and she held the door for 
theiiK Inside, she dialed all the fur- 
niture into the floor, leaving a 
large, bare room with white walls. 

“What do I do?” she asked in a 
small voice. He reached out and 
took her hand, which melted into 
the substance of Bailey. 

“Give me your other hand.” She 
did so, and watched stoically as the 
green stuff crept up her hands and 
arms. “Don’t look at it,” Barnum 
advised, and she obeyed. 

He felt air next to his skin as 
Bailey began manufacturing an at- 
mosphere inside himself and inflat- 
ing like a balloon. The green sphere 
got larger, hiding Barnum com- 
pletely and gradually absorbing 
Tympani. In five minutes the fea- 
tureless green ball filled the room. 

“I’d never seen that,” she said, 
as they stood holding hands. 

“Usually we do it only in 
space.” 

“What comes next?” 

“Just hold still.” She saw him 
glance over her . shoulder, and 
started to turn. She thought better of 
it and tensed, knowing what was 
coming. 

23 




A slim tendril had grown out of 
the inner surface of the symb and 
groped its way toward the computer 
terminal at the back of her head. 
She cringed as it touched her, then 
relaxed as it wormed its way in. 

“How’s the contact?” Barnum 
asked Bailey 

“Just a minute . I’m still feel- 
ing it out.” The symb had oozed 
through the microscopic entry points 
at the rear of the terminal and was 
following the network of filaments 
that extended through her cerebrum. 
Reaching the end of one, Bailey 
would quest further, searching for 
the loci he knew so well in Bar- 
num. 

“They’re slightly different,” he 
told Barnum. “I’ll have to do a lit- 
tle testing to be sure I’m at the right 
spots.” 

Tympani jumped, then looked 
down in horror as her arms and legs 
did a dance without her volition. 

“Tell him to stop that!” she 
shrieked, then gasped as Bailey ran 
through a rapid series of memory- 
sensory loci; in almost instantaneous 
succession she experienced the 
smell of an orange blossom, the 
void of the womb, an embarrassing 
incident as a child, her first free- 
fall. She tasted a meal eaten fifteen 
years ago. It was like spinning a 
radio dial through the frequencies, 
getting fragments of a thousand un- 
related songs, and yet able to hear 
each of them in its entirety. It lasted 
less than a second and left her 
weak. But the weakness was illu- 



sory, too, and she recovered and 
found herself in Bamum’s arms. 

“Make him stop it,” she de- 
manded, struggling away from him. 

“It’s over,” he said. 

“Well, almost,” Bailey said. The 
rest of the process was conducted 
beneath her conscious level. “I’m 
in,” he told Barnum. “I can’t 
guarantee how well this will work. I 
wasn’t built for this sort of thing, 
you know. I need a larger entry 
point than that terminal, more like 
the one I sank into the top of your 
head.” 

“Is there any danger to her? 

“Nope, but there’s a chance I’ll 
get overloaded and have to halt the 
whole thing. There’s going to be a 
lot of traffic over that little tendril 
and I can’t be sure it’ll handle the 
load.” 

“We’ll just have to do our best.” 

“They faced each other. Tympani 
was tense and stony-eyed. 

“What’s next?” she asked again, 
planting her feet on the thin but 
springy and warm surface of Bailey. 

“I was hoping you’d do the 
opening bars. Give me a lead to fol- 
low. You’ve done this once, even if 
it didn’t work.” 

“All right. Take my hands . .” 

* * ★ 

Barnum had no idea how the 
composition would start. She chose 
a very subdued tempo. It was not a 
dirge; in fact, in the beginning it 
had no tempo at all. It was a ffee- 



24 



GALAXY 




form tone poem. She moved with a 
glacial slowness that had none of 
the loose sexuality he had expected. 
Barnum watched, and heard a deep 
undertone develop and knew it as 
the awakening awareness in his own 
mind. It was his first response. 

Gradually, as she began to move 
in his direction, he essayed some 
movement. His music added itself 
to hers but it remained seperate and 
did not harmonize. They were sit- 
ting in different rooms, hearing 
each other through the walls. 

She reached down and touched 
his leg with her fingertips. She 
drew her hand slowly along him and 
the sound was like fingernails rasp- 
ing on a blackboard. It clashed, it 
grated, it tore at his nerves. It left 
him shaken, but he continued with 
the dance. 

Again she touched him, and the 
theme repeated itself. A third time, 
with the same results. He relaxed 
into it, understood it as a part of 
their music, harsh as it was. It was 
her tension. 

He knelt in front of her and put 
his hands to her waist. She turned, 
slowly, making a sound like a rusty 
metal plate rolling along a concrete 
floor. She kept spinning and the 
tone began to modulate and acquire 
a rhythm. It throbbed, syncopated, 
as a function of their heartbeats. 
Gradually the tones began to soften 
and blend. Tympani’s skin was glis- 
tening with sweat as she turned fast- 
er. Then, at a signal he never con- 
sciously received, Barnum lifted her 

goha sing, goha dance 



in the air and the sounds cascaded 
around them as they embraced. She 
kicked her legs joyously and it 
combined with the thunderous bass 
protest of his straining leg muscles 
to produce an airborne series of 
chromatics. It reached a crescendo 
that was impossible to sustain, then 
tapered off as her feet touched the 
floor and they collapsed into each 
other. The sounds muttered to 
themselves, unresolved, as they 
cradled each other and caught their 
breath. 

“Now we’re in tune, at least,’’ 
Tympani whispered, and the symb- 
synapticon picked up the nerve im- 
pulses in her mouth and ears and 
tongue as she said it and heard it, 
and mixed it with the impulses from 
Barnum’s ears. The result was a 
vanishing series of arpeggios con- 
structed around each word that 
echoed around them for minutes. 
She laughed when she heard it, 
and that was music even without the 
dressings. 

The music had never stopped. It 
still inhabited the space around 
them, gathering itself into dark 
pools around their feet and pulsing 
in a diminishing allegretto with their 
hissing breath. 

“It’s gotten dark,’’ she whis- 
pered, afraid to brave the intensity 
of sound if she were to speak aloud. 
Her words wove around Barnum’s 
head as he lifted his eyes to look 
around them. “There are things 
moving around out there,” she said. 
The tempo increased slightly as her 

25 




heart caught on the dark-on-dark 
outlines she sensed. 

“The sounds are taking shape,” 
Barnum said. “Don’t be afraid of 
them. It’s in your mind.” 

“I’m not sure I want to see that 
deeply into my mind.” 

* * * 

As the second movement started, 
stars began to appear over their 
heads. Tympani lay supine on a sur- 
face that was beginning to yield be- 
neath her, like sand or some thick 
liquid. She accepted it. She let it 
conform to her shoulderblades as 
Barnum coaxed music from her 
body with his hands. He found 
handfuls of pure, bell-like tones, 
unencumbered with timbre or reso- 
nance; existing by themselves. Put- 
ting his lips to her, he sucked out a 
mouthful of chords which he blew 
out one by one, where they clus- 
tered like bees around his nonsense 
words, ringing change after change 
on the harmonies in his voice. 

She stretched her arms over her 
head and bared her teeth, grabbing 
at the sand that was now as real to 
her touch as her own body was. 
Here was the sexuality Barnum had 
sought. Brash and libidinous as a 
goddess in the Hindu pantheon, her 
body shouted like a dixieland 
clarinet and the sounds caught on 
the waving tree limbs overhead and 
thrashed about like tattered sheets. 
Laughing, she held her hands before 
her face and watched as sparks of 

26 



blue and white fire arced across her 
fingertips. The sparks leaped out to 
Barnum and he glowed where they 
touched him. 

The universe they were visiting 
was an extraordinarily cooperative 
one. When the sparks jumped from 
Tympani’s hands into the dark,' 
cloud-streaked sky, bolts of light- 
ning came skittering back at her. 
They were awesome, but not fear- 
some. Tympani knew them to be 
productions of Bailey’s mind. But 
she liked them. When the tornados 
formed above her and writhed in a 
dance around her head, she liked 
that, too. 

The gathering storm increased as 
the tempo of their music increased, 
in perfect step. Gradually, Tympani 
lost track of what was happening. 
The fire in her body was trans- 
formed into madness; a piano rol- 
ling down a hillside or a harp being 
used as a trampoline. There Was the 
drunken looseness of a slide trom- 
bone played at the botton of a well. 
She ran her tongue over his cheek 
and it was the sound of beads of oil 
falling on a snare drum. Barnum 
sought entrance to the concert hall, 
sounding like a head-on collision of 
harpsichords. 

Then someone pulled the plug on 
the turntable motor and the tape was 
left to thread its way through the, 
heads at a slowly diminishing speed 
as they rested. The music gabbled 
insistently at them, reminding them 
that this could only be a brief in- 
termission, that they were in the 



GALAXY 



command of forces beyond them- 
selves. They accepted it, Tympani 
sitting lightly in Barnum’s lap, fac- 
ing him, and allowing herself to be 
cradled in his arms. 

“Why the pause?’’ Tympani 
asked, and was delighted to see her 
words escape her mouth not in 
sound, but in print. She touched the 
small letters as they fluttered to the 
ground. 

“Bailey requested it,’’ Barnum 
said, also in print. “His circuits are 
overloading.’’ His words orbited 
twice around his head, then van- 
ished. 

“And why the skywriting?’’ 

“So as not to foul the music with 
more words.’’ 

She nodded, and rested her head 
on his shoulder again. 

Barnum was happy. He gently 
stroked her back, producing a 
warm, fuzzy rumble. He shaped the 
contours of the sound with his fin- 
gertips. Living in the Ring, he was 
used to the feeling of triumphing 
over something infinitely vast. With 
the aid of Bailey he could scale 
down the mighty Ring until it was 
within the scope of a human mind. 
But nothing he had ever experi- 
enced rivalled the sense of power he 
felt in touching Tympani and 
getting — music. 

A breeze was starting to eddy 
around them. It rippled the leaves 
of the tree that arched over them. 
The lovers had stayed planted on 
the ground during the height of the 
storm; now the breeze lifted them 



into the air and wafted them into 
the gray clouds. 

Tympani had not noticed it. 
When she opened her eyes all she 
knew was that they were back in 
limbo again, alone with the music. 
And the music was beginning to 
build. 

The last movement was both 
more harmonious and less varied. 
They were finally in tune, acknow- 
ledging the baton of the same con- 
ductor. The piece they were extem- 
porizing was jubilant. It was noisy 
and broad, and gave signs of be- 
coming Wagnerian. But somewhere 
the Gods were laughing. 

Tympani flowed with it, letting it 
become her. Barnum was sketching 
out the melody line while she was 
content to supply the occassional 
appogiatura, the haunting nuance 
that prevented it from becoming 
ponderous. 

The clouds began to withdraw, 
slowly revealing the new illusion 
that Baily had moved them to. It 
was hazy. But it was vast. Tympani 
opened her eyes and saw 

— the view from the Upper Half, 
only a few kilometers above the 
plane of the Ring. Below her was 
an infinite golden surface and above 
her were stars. Her eyes were 
drawn to the plane, down 
there. .it was thin. Insubstantial. 
One could see right through it. 
Shielding her eyes from the glare of 
the sun (and introducing a forlorn 
minor theme into the music) she 
peered into the whirling marvel they 



28 



GALAXY 




had taken her out here to see and 
her ears were filled with the shrieks 
of her unspoken fear as Bailey 
picked it up. There were stars down 
there, all around her, and moving 
toward her, and she was moving 
through them, and they were begin- 
ning to revolve, and . 

... the inner surface of Bailey. 
Above her unseeing eyes, a slim 
green tendril, severed, was writhing 
back into the wall. It disappeared.

“Burnt out.” 

“Are you all right?” Barnum 
asked him. 

“I’m all right. Burnt out. You 
felt it. I warned you the connection 
might not handle the traffic.” 

Barnum consoled him. “We 
never expected that intensity.” He 
shook his head, trying to clear the 
memory of that awful moment. He 
had his fears, but evidently no 
phobias. Nothing had ever gripped 
him like the Rings gripped Tym- 
pani. 

He gratefully felt Bailey slip in 
and ease the pain back into a comer 
of his mind where he needn’t look 
at it. Plenty of time for that later, 
on the long, silent orbits they would 
soon be following . 

Tympani was sitting up, puzzled, 
but beginning to smile. Barnum 
wished Bailey could give him a re- 
port on her mental condition, but 
the connection was broken. Shock? 
He’d forgotten the symptoms. 

goha sing, goha dance 



“I’ll have to find out for my- 
self,” he told Bailey. 

“She looks all right to me,” 
Bailey said. “I was calming her as 
the contact was breaking. She might 
not remember much.” 

She didn’t. Or, mercifully, she 
remembered the happiness but had 
only a vague impression of the fear 
at the end. She didn’t want to look 
at it, which was just as well. There 
was no need for her to be tantalized 
or taunted by something she could 
never have. 

They made love there inside 
Bailey. It was quiet and deep, and 
lasted a long time. What lingering 
hurts there were found healing in 
that gentle silence, punctuated only 
by the music of their breathing. 

Then Bailey slowly retracted 
around Barnum, contracting their 
universe down to man-size and 
forever excluding Tympani. 

It was an awkward time for them. 
Barnum and Bailey were due at the 
catapult in an hour. All three knew 
that Tympani could never follow 
them, but they didn’t speak of it. 
They promised to remain friends, 
and knew it was empty. 

Tympani had a financial state- 
ment which she handed to Barnum. 

“Two thousand, minus nineteen 
ninety-five for the pills.” She 
dropped the dozen small pellets into 
his other hand. They contained the 
trace elements the Pair could not 
obtain in the Ring, and constituted 
the only reason they ever needed to 
visit Janus. 

29 




“Is that enough?” Tympani 
asked, anxiously. 

Barnum looked at the sheet of 
paper. He had to think hard to re- 
call how important money was to 
single humans. He had little use for 
it. 

His bank balance would keep 
him in supplement pills for 
thousands of years if he could live 
that long, even if he never came 
back to sell another song. And he 
understood now why there was so 
little repeat business on Janus. Pairs 
and humans could not mix. The 
only common ground was art, and 
even there the single humans were 
driven by monetary pressures alien 
to Pairs. 

“Sure, that’s fine,” he said, and 
tossed the paper aside. “It’s more 
than I need.” 

Tympani was relieved. 

“I know that of course,” she 
said, feeling guilty. “But I always 
feel like an exploiter. It’s not very 
much. Rag says this one could re- 
ally take off and we could get rich. 
And that’s all you’U ever get out of 
it.” 

Barnum knew that, and didn’t 
care. 

“It’s really all we need,” he re- 
peated. “I’ve already been paid in the 
only coin I value, which was the 
privilege of knowing you.” 

They left it at that. 

ir it ir 

The countdown wasn’t a long 



one. The operators of the cannon 
tended to herd the Pairs through the 
machine like cattle through a gate. 
But it was plenty of time for Bar- 
num and Bailey, on stretched-time, 
to embed Tympani in amber. 

“Why?” Barnum asked at one 
point. “Why here? Where does the 
fear come from?” 

“I saw some things,” Bailey said^' 
thoyghtfully. “I was going to probe, 
but then I hated myself for it. I 
decided to leave her private traumas 
alone.” 

The count was ticking slowly 
down to the firing signal, and a 
bass, mushy music began to play in 
Barnum ’s ears. 

“Do you still love her?” Barnum 
asked. 

“More than ever.” 

“So do I. It feels good, and it 
hurts. I suppose we’ll get over it. 
But from now on, we’d better keep 
our world down to a size we can 
handle. What is that music, any- 
way?” 

“A send-off,” Bailey said. He 
accelerated them until they could 
hear h. “It’s coming over the radio. 
A circus march.” 

Barnum had no sooner recognized 
it than he felt the gentle but increas- 
ing push of the cannon accelerating 
him up the tube. He laughed, anc 
the two of them shot out of the 
bulging brass pipe of the Pearly 
Gates Calliope. They made a bulls- 
eye through a giant orange smoke 
ring, accompanied by the strains of 
“Thunder and Blazes.” ★

As OF TWELVE-FIFTEEN this af-

on the wall was saying, ‘‘when

the human race will no longer be

tol, then sighted along the large-

ticular. 

‘‘What time is it?” he asked, put- 
ting the weapon into the left pocket 
of his jacket. 

‘‘Seven minutes and forty-three 
seconds before five a. m.,” said the 
wall. 

He nodded. It would be getting 
light outside, and the crowds would 
soon begin to gather at the terminal. 
He left and hurried down to the 
street. He would have to show up

Lumbering across the tarmac on 
its tricycle landing gear, the 
wedge-shaped shuttlecraft could 
have been a sculptor’s larger-than- 
life parody of the Cygnians. Gover- 
nor James Amost Trentino smiled 
slightly at the thought and watched 
as the ship rolled into the shadow of 
the disembarkation ramp and 
lurched to a stop. 

‘‘Aren’t you at all nervous about 
this?” Vera Marcal asked at his 
side. 

Trentino did not look away from 
the window. On the tarmac, the 
ship began to extrude its cylindrical 
airlock into the waiting mouth of 
the ramp. 

‘‘I woke up with a premonition 
this morning,” he said. ‘‘Today is 
going to go down as smoothly as 
cream, Vera.” 

Behind him, Emily Teasdale gave 
a soft snort of amusement. ‘‘I hate 
having to be the one to remind you, 
James, but you checked out a dud 
in the precog department. The fleet 
and the Cygnian vessel have been 
giving one another the eye upstairs 
for the past four days, the 
separatists are howling for yours 
and Chicolini’s blood ... if you 
had any sense, you’d be as scared 
as the rest of us.” 

Marcal shifted her attache case 
from hand to hand and grinned at

the governor. “She’s right, James. 
We’re walking the tightrope over 
the abyss. If we don’t get the Cyg- 
nians into the Network, TNC will 
be putting your head out to dry on 
an iron spike.” 

“You two are such a damned 
comfort,” Trentino said with a 
sigh. “Be calm. Chicolini’s been 
aboard the alien vessel ever since it 
dropped into orbit. He knows them, 
and they know him. He’ll put them 
at their ease. The separatists are too 
much in the minority to cause real 
trouble. Be calm. This is the big 
moment. The one we’ve been wait- 
ing and working for. The moment 
they’ll always remember us for.” 
“That’s what George Custer told 
his troops in 1876,” Teasdale said. 

He half-turned to give her a sour 
look. His throat beeped softly. He 
pressed a fingertip against a small, 
hard lump under his jaw and said, 
in sub-vocals, trentino here.

thank you. He shot a questioning 
look at one of the many uniformed 
security guards posted at intervals 
throughout the lobby. The woman 
signaled that she, too, had received 
the information. 

“Well,” Trentino said to his two 
aides, “bright smiles now.” 

They moved away from the win- 
dow overlooking the tarmac and 
stood at attention before the sealed

door of the ramp. Trentino touched 
his sub-dermal communicator again. 
max. 

everything’ s fine out here on the 
street, governor, monitors going full 
blast, lots of excitement, but noth- 
ing to worry about, looks like the 
anti-network factions and the 
xenophobes are sleeping late, or 
watching it at home and bitching. 

thanks, max. 

He took his finger off his throat, 
and then the ramp doors slid open, 
and Major Joseph F. Chicolini and 
the Cygnian delegate stepped forth. 

Trentino gasped in spite of him- 
self. 

It had been one thing to see the 
images the Cygnians broadcast from 
their starship. It was quite another 
thing altogether to have one of the 
creatures stand close, to hear the 
sound its chitinous feet made on the 
floor, to smell its dusty odor. 

The Cygnian was a wedge-bodied 
being with a shiny blue carapace, 
stilt-like legs with bulbous joints, 
clusters of lesser appendages 
clutched tightly against its under- 
side. Its face, or, rather, the 
droplet-like cluster of sensory or- 
gans above the horn-lipped mouth at 
the point of the wedge, was on a 
level with Trentino’s chin. 

Major Chicolini, a smallish man 
who did not look especially com- 
fortable in his ornate dress uniform, 
saluted, took Trentino’s hand for a 
second and said, “Governor Tren- 
tino, may I present the delegate 
from 61 Cygni?” 



33 




Trentino and the two women 
bowed stiffly from the waist. 

The Cygnian unfolded a delicate- 
looking grasping appendage, took 
a hemispherical object from a hols- 
ter strapped above the first joint of 
its foreleg and held the flat surface 
of the instrument against its throat 
sac. 

“We see you once again,” it said 
in a startling bass growl, “and we 
rejoice. We see that you are well, 
and we are satisified.” 

“We extend a welcome in the 
name of the Terran Network,” the 
governor replied, “and we con- 
gratulate you on your mastery of 
our language.” 

He smiled and darted a look at 
the major, touched his throat and 
said, what was that part about see- 
ing me again, chicolini? 

the cygnian mass-mind at work, 
bear it in mind when you’re dealing 
with the delegate, governor, the 
twelve or thirteen billion adult cyg- 
nians compose a single entity with a 
shared consciousness, natural for it 
to assume we’re no different. 

“We have a vehicle waiting,” 
Trentino said, “to convey us to the 
reception at Doucet Tower.” He 
turned, and Major Chicolini and the 
alien drew abreast of him. Marcal 
and Teasdale fell into step behind 
them. As they started across the 
lobby, half a dozen security guards 
detached themselves from the walls 
and moved with them. 

Trentino’s throat beeped again. 
go ahead.

for your party and security person- 
nel, from gate three to the street. 

good, keep it that way. He 
touched his throat again, max.

citement level’s shooting up, but ev- 
eryone’ s behaving, nobody’s tried 
to break through the security line, 
god knows how they’ll react when

security maneuvers, sir. 
don’t i know it. 

They walked on in silence dis- 
turbed only by the click of the Cyg- 
nian’s feet. When they arrived at 
the main doors of the terminal, 
Trentino almost hesitated. Through 
the smoky dark plate glass, he 
could see the van and the escort 
vehicles, the two parallel lines' of 
uniformed men and women holding 
back the crowd. He swallowed hard 
and abruptly realized that the palms 
of his hands were slick with perspi- 
ration. 

Calmly now, he told himself. 
This is your day, J. A. The day the 
Cygnians first set foot upon a Ter- 
ran Network world. The day you 
welcome 61 Cygni into the Net- 
work. Calmly now. With dignity. 

He put a slight smile on his lips 
and stepped through the doorway, 
into the hazy warmth of Alpha Cen- 
tauri’s midday light, into a swelling 
tide of ohs and ahs and here they 
come NOWs. Three red, pearl- 
smooth telefax balloons settled 
lower in the air above his head and 



GALAXY 




fixed their glittering glass eyes on 
him, on Major Chicolini, on the 
Cygnian. He glanced up for the 
benefit of the cameras, shot a 
quick, nervous look at the open 
mouths and widening eyes beyond 
the security line on his left, then, as 
the murmurs of the multitude 
deepened to a roar, forced himself 
to look straight ahead at the van. 

There was an urgent buzzing 
sound from his communicator. The 
sound did not have time in which 
register upon his mind as the 
emergency signal before his earring 
hissed, we're picking up someth — 

The governor never knew 
whether Max stopped speaking in 
midsyllable or whether he simply 
did not hear the rest of the sen- 
tence. One of the guards before and 
to the right of him lurched forward 
from the security line, buckled at 
the knees, toppled. Someone lunged 
through the gap in the line and 
pointed something in his direction, 
but it was only after the first shot 
had been fired that he recognized 
the thing the person was holding as 
a large gun. , 

There was a second shot, a 
scream, yells. Unable to move or 
speak, Trentino could only stare as 
the attacker went down under sev- 
eral security guards. Arms flailed. 
Hands clutched. There was a third 
shot, immediately followed by an 
explosion above Trentino’s head. 
Something struck him low on the 
left side of the neck. He blinked, 
touched the spot where the blow 

larval stage 



had fallen, felt a hard, sharp object 
protruding from the flesh at the 
juncture of neck and shoulder. His 
hand came away wet and sticky. 

The governor looked at the blood 
on his fingers for a moment, then, 
bewildered, at the telefax balloons 
overhead. There were only two of 
them now. 

Unmindful of the hell breaking 
loose, all around him, he sat down 
on the pavement and rubbed his 
fingertips together. Someone bawled 
his name. Consciousness fled. 

it If ir 

The light in the room was soft 
and soothing. He thought of the 
look on Governor Trentino’s face, 
and he tried to grin. But they had 
paralyzed him. The muscles around 
his slightly parted lips quivered in- 
effectually. He made a sobbing 
sound in the back of his throat.

tion never heard a word 1 said never

ing at you but I knew I knew I

The light in the room was soft 
and soothing. He make a chuckling 
sound in the back of his throat. 

*• * * 

“A call, sir,” the wall an- 
nounced, “from Ms. Teasdale.” 

Trentino frowned, his thick eye- 
brows almost meeting above the 
bridge of his nose, and stabbed a 
finger down on the HOLD tab. The 
wafer-thin dictation slate on the 
desk before him clicked. He re- 
garded the lines of type covering 
the top half of the slate for a second 
more before answering. 

“Did she say what she wants?” 

“She said only that it’s impor- 
tant, sir.” 

“Of course it is.” Trentino 
looked at the slate and absently fin- 
gered the faint pink scar at the base 
of his neck, where the sliver of 
shrapnel from the exploding telefax 
balloon had struck him. He had not 
been enjoying the task of preparing 
a report to Terran Network Central 
on Earth. He would, he knew, 
enjoy the repercussions even less. 
His gaze settled upon a paragraph a 



quarter of the way down the slate.

“Sir,” the wall said, “Ms. Teas- 
dale insists that you speak with 
her.” 

“Oh. Yes. Of course.” Trentino 
shoved the slate aside, , sank back 
into his chair and watched across 
the tips of steepled fingers as a rec- 
tangular section of the wall oppo- 
site his desk shimmered, dissolved 
and was replaced by an image of 
the pale face of Emily Teasdale. He 
forced a smile that buried the ends 
of his moustache in the creases 
bracketing his mouth and said, 
“Emily.” 

“We’re still waiting for the re- 
sults of this man Crater’s psyche- 
check, Governor.”

“They’re on their way down 
now. Chicolini’s still trying to ex- 
plain matters to the Cygnian?” 
Teasdale grimaced and nodded. 
“Is the alien still having fits?” 
“No. Not really. Though I 
wouldn’t blame it if it was. It’s got- 
ten over the shock of the incident at 
least to the point where it isn’t so 
much angry as baffled.” 

“Have Chicolini assure the dele- 
gate that Crater is certifiably in- 
sane.” 

“Of course.” 

“Emily, does Chicolini think we 
have any chance at all of getting 
ourselves out of this mess intact.” 
Teasdale started to shake her 
head, then shrugged. “He’s not 
very optimistic. Governor. Even 
with evidence of Crater’s insanity, 
he thinks it’s going to be extremely 
difficult, if not impossible, to make 
the alien understand exactly what 
happened at the terminal.” 

“But surely the Cygnian realizes 
that we took every possible step to 
ensure its safety, and that — ” 

“What Chicolini is faced with,” 
Teasdale cut in, “is trying to ex- 
plain irrational behavior on the part 
of a member of our race to an entity 
incapable of quite grasping the idea 
that the whole of Homo sapiens 
isn’t totally responsible for all of its 
parts.” 

Treiitino groaned softly. He saw 
Teasdale look off-camera, obviously 
listening to someone, saw her nod 
and accept a red-backed folder. 

“The report on Crater just ar-

rived,” she said, facing the gover- 
nor again. “I hope it helps.” 

“Keep me posted, Emily.” 

“Of course.” 

Teasdale’s image shrank and van- 
ished. Trentino touched another but- 
ton on his desk. “Osborn.” 

“Yes, sir,” came the reply. 

“Any change upstairs?” 

“No, sir. Fleet reports that the 
Cygnian vessel still has its shields 
up and its weapons systems at the 
ready. No activity apart from that.” 
“Fine.” I guess, he added to 
himself as he cleared the line. “Get 
me Duncan at the hospital.” 

“Yes, sir.” There was a pause. 
“Sir, Ms. Graham is calling.” 



37 



Trentino mouthed a couple of 
heartfelt obscenities. “Put her on 
hold.” 

Lamont Duncan’s face appeared 
on the wall. “Hello, Governor.” 
“Any word yet on Vera?” 
Duncan’s teeth went into his 
lower lip for a second. “They’re 
still working on her. Possible inter- 
nal injuries resulting from the con- 
cussion when the cannon shell 
struck her attache case. And her 
arm almost came off from the 
elbow down. They had her frozen 
down within three minutes of the 
shooting. She may be all right. She 
may be all mush inside, and they’d 
have to scoop her out and put in 
prostheses.” 

“God damn it.” He scowled at 
the dictation slate. “Okay. Stay 
there, Lamont. Call me if. .” 
“Of course, sir.” 

Trentino blanked the wall. It 
said, “Ms. Graham is holding, 
sir.” 

The governor repressed a snarl. 
He had never liked Katherine 
Graham, and his inability to root 
her out of the Network bureaucracy 
of Alpha Centauri IV had never 
ceased to rankle him. “Put her 
on!” 

Graham looked pleased with her- 
self when her image solidified. 
“Governor,” she said, “we’ve 
completed the public-opinion survey 
analysis. An overwhelming majority 
of the populace feels that this man 
Crater’s attack on the delegate from 
61 Cygni is an outrage.” 

38 



“How wonderful.” 

Graham nodded, oblivious to air 
sarcasm. “We’ve laid out a whole 
series of telefax releases, and, as 
soon as you’ve approved them, we 
can start feeding them to the public. 
By linking Crater to the separatists, 
we can effectively undermine — no, 
better than that, we can utterly de- 
stroy the credibility of the entire 
anti-Earth movement. After that, 
anybody who dares speak out 
against Network policy, or against 
the things from 61 Cygni, will run 
the risk of being torn to pieces by 
patriotic citizens.” 

“That’s beautiful, Graham. 
That’s what I call really taking ad- 
vantage of a golden opportunity.” 
Graham beamed. “I knew you’d 
like it, sir.” 

“Unfortunately, it isn’t the truth. 
Crater isn’t a separatist. He’s a to- 
tally apolitical, totally mad per- 
son.” 

“But—” 

“Even if it was the truth,” Tren- 
tino went on, “we couldn’t use him 
to discredit the separatists.” 

Graham stared at him disbeliev- 
ingly. “Governor, we can’t throw 
away a chance like this! Now, 
while public opinion is definitely in 
our favor, now is the time to kill 
the separatist cause for all time! 
We’ve never had a weapon like 
Crator before!” 

“We’ve never been tangled up 
with aliens before, either.” He 
paused, savoring the lost look in the 
woman’s eyes. “In case you’ve 



GALAXY 




been too busy to keep abreast of 
things, Graham, let me explain it to 
you as simply as I can. What we’ve 
been trying to do for the past ten 
years, ever since the first expedition 
to 61 Cygni, is get the Cygnians 
into the Network. Crater’s compli- 
cated matters to the tenth power. 
You’ll complicate them infinitely 
more if you get the public boiled up 
over politics. We have to gloss over 
internal disunities. We have to show 
(he Cygnians that, unfortunate inci- 
dents like this one notwithstanding, 
we as a race are as ... as single- 
minded in our desires as they are. 
So discard your prospectus for the 
anti-separatist releases.” He smiled. 
“We must perforce break with tra- 
dition and give out plain, unadorned 
truth, Graham. I know that won’t 
be any fun for you, but it’s essen- 
tial.” 

Without waiting for her to reply, 
Trentino blanked the wall. Almost 
at once, he was informed that Major 
Chicolini was calling. The governor 
made a tired sound, dialed for a 
tranquilizer and waited for the drug 
to enter his bloodstream through the 
mucous membrane of mouth and 
throat before accepting the call. 

Major Chicolini looked grim. De- 
spite the drug, Trentino felt the bot- 
tom drop out of his stomach. 

“Well?” the governor demanded. 
“Have you. ?” 

“It wants Crater, sir.” 

“It whatT' 

“The Cygnian wants Crater.” 
Trentino dialed for a second tran- 

iarval stage 



quilizer. “Why does it want him?” 
“It won’t say. Or it can’t say.” 
Trentino ignored the tranquilizer 
in his hand and glared at Chicolini. 
“Major, I can’t just hand a Net- 
work citizen, even a crazy one, 
over to the alien. Especially not 
without a reason.” 

“Governor, 1 appreciate your 
position. But the Cygnian insists 
that if have Crater.” 

“No. Emphatically not. Crater is 
our responsibility.” 

“Then I’ve just wasted ten 
hours,” Major Chicolini snapped, 
“convincing the delegate that Crater 
is not our responsibility.” A note of 
pleading entered his voice. “Sir, I 
don’t think that the Cygnian has any 
intention of harming Crater. 
It’s . curious.” 

“Curious? Curious about what?” 
>“It’s asking to be allowed to 
prove to itself, to its own satisfac- 
tion, that what I’ve been telling it 
about human beings is the truth. 
That we are an adult, fully de- 
veloped race of separate, whole- 
unto-ourselves beings. As far as the 
Cygnian knows, this is an irrecon- 
ciliable dichotomy. The only exper- 
ience it’s had with anything re- 
motely resembling our kind of crea- 
ture is with its own larvae. Vicious, 
unpredictable things that don’t enter 
the Cygnian mind-link until the 
pupal stage.” 

The two men stared at each other 
for a long moment. 

“It’s been a rotten day,” Tren- 
tino finally said. 



39 




Major Chicolini nodded. “Let it 
have Crater,” he said. “If you do, 
chances are we won’t be much worse 
off than we were when the delegate 
and I came up the ramp at noon.” 

“That’s your considered opin- 
ion?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“You realize. Major, that we’re 
all in bad, bad trouble if this — ” 
Trentino leaned forward in his seat 
to tap the dictation slate “ — goes 
off to Earth without a happy ending 
on it.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

The governor massaged the 
bridge of his nose and caught him- 
self wishing, really wishing, that he 
had grown up to be anything other 
than a mildly efficient, mildy honest 
politician. 

“Very well,” he said. “The 
Cygnian gets Crater.”

He lay upon his back, helpless, 
unable to move, held against a 
slick, slightly convex surface, in a 
place where the air had an odd 
flavor, where machinery hummed 
softly to itself, where wedge-bodied 
creatures clustered about him. 

One of the creatures touched his 
naked thigh with a chitinous claw. 
“Don’t touch me, God damn it!’’ 
The creature pressed an instru- 
ment against its throat and rumbled, 
“This one is severed?” 

“In a manner of speaking.” A 
human voice. A smallish man in an 
ornate but rather rumpled-looking 
uniform appeared among the aliens. 
“It is not a . young?” 

“It is aberrant. It has reached its 
full physical growth. It does not 
conform to our standard. It is cut 
off from the rest of its kind.” 
“Severed,” said the alien. 

The uniformed man bent over 
him and whispered, “Crater.” 
“Albert Crater. Albert Dean Cra- 
ter. Mr. Albert Dean Crater.” He 
studied the uniformed man’s face 
for a second, trying to remember 
where he had seen it before. “I 
suppose you want to talk to me.” 



40 




“Crater, listen to me.” 

“Listen to me." He strained 
against the unyielding grip of the 
convexity. “No one ever listens to 
^e. It’s i\mt everybody listened.” 
“Crater, do you know where you 
are?” 

“I want to see somebody. I want 
everybody to hear why I did it. 
Where is everybody?” 

“The Cygnians — ” 

“Cygnians fygnians pygnians.” 
He giggled shrilly. “Wygnians.” 
‘‘The Cygnians are going to 
probe you. Crater. Just relax. Be 
calm. It won’t hurt you.” 
‘‘Everybody hurts me. Every- 
body. I got back at them, though. 
Didn’t I? Didn’t I? Did you see 
the look on their faces?” 

‘‘Just relax,” the uniformed man 
hissed softly. He straightened and 
looked at the aliens. “He’s as ready 
as he can be. The drugs have worn 
off. He’s fully conscious.” 

The man spreadeagled on the 
convexity closed his eyes. They 
aren’t listening to me, he thought. 
They’re ignoring me again. They 
aren’t coming to talk to me. I’m 
tired of being lonely. I’m tired of it. 
That’s what I. Will tell them. I’m 
tired. Of being. Cut. Off. 

The curved surface beneath him 
seemed to grow soft. Alarmed, he 
opened his eyes and found himself 
mottling through something warm 
®od milky white in color. He 
opened his mouth to cry out, but 
*he stuff poured into his throat. 
Silencing him without choking him.

Directly above his face, a fuzzy 
sphere of bluish light appeared. 
Scintillae separated from it and 
flickered out of existence. He shut 
his eyes, trying to close out the 
bluish light, and super-novae flared 
on the inner sides of his eyelids, 
slivers of glass sliced at his optic 
nerves, something long and cool 
and hard stabbed behind his face. 
He had to look. He had to look. 

He saw chitinous claws operating 
levers. He saw consoles and 
examined dials marked off with an- 
gular characters and knew what they 
signified. He saw one of the aliens 
approaching along a tunnel-like .cor- 
ridor, and, as he approached along 
a tunnel-like corridor, he saw one 
of the aliens watching him. He saw 



41 




the familiar green orb of Alpha 
Centauri IV through an observation 
port and knew a longing for 
geometric buildings gleaming in the 
harsh light of a strange sun. He saw 
the uniformed man standing be- 
tween two aliens. He saw the uni- 
formed man standing on either side 
of him. He saw a naked man 
spreadeagled on the surface of a 
glowing bubble. He saw the sphere 
of bluish light above his face. 

He saw, and something within 
himself parted like tissue paper, and 
he was calmed, and he was no 
longer alone. 

“This one,” he heard the alien 
say, “is not severed now.” 

It -k * 

“Crater,” Dr. Janice Op- 
penheimer said, “was a prize inef- 
fectual. A person who’d spent the 
first thirty-eight years of his life 
feeling inadequate and ignored, ac- 
complishing nothing, amounting to 
nothing. He went over the edge, fi- 
nally. But whatever the Cygnians 
did to him, it seems to have helped. 
He was calm, if exhausted, when 
the major here returned him from 
the aliens’ vessel.” 

Trentino finished his cup of 
stimulac and eased back into the 
fragrant depths of his chair. He had 
slept no more than thirteen of the 
fifty-two hours since the shooting at 
the terminal. He ached with fatigue. 
Dr. Oppenheimer and Major Chico- 

42 



lini sat opposite his desk, both < 
them looking fresh and rested. T1 
governor regarded them enviously. 

“Is Crater still certifiable?” 1 
asked the doctor. 

Dr. Oppenheimer shrugged. “It 
too soon to tell. Cygnian psycb 
therapuetic techniques are still b< 
yond our comprehension at th 
point.” 

Major Chicolini cleared his thro 
quietly and said, “The Cygnian 
term for the larval stage of the 
own species roughly translates i 
severed. The condition of not beii 
in communication with the adult 
mass-mind. The larvae enter tl 
pupal phase of development an 
emerge as joined. There are aberrs 
tions from time to time, whe 
pupae emerged into adulthood b 
can’t — or won’t, perhaps — lit 
themselves with the other grow 
ups. In such cases the Cygniai 
. .fix them.” 

Trentino cocked an eyebrow 
Dr. Oppenheimer. “And Crat^ 
has been fixed, too?” 

“Crater has been somethingci 
Governor. We don’t know what i 
how. We ran three psyche-checl 
on him in as many hours. He w 
calm, happy, at worst, a little co 
fused to find himself back on tl 
ground again. At best, complete 
cured of his psychosis.” 

“Excuse me, sir,” said the wa 
“Dr. Oppenheimer has a call fro 
Dr. Gill.” 

“There’s a private line in the 
brary,” Trentino said.

“Thank you.” Dr. Oppenheimer 
got to her feet and left the gover- 
nor’s office. 

Major Chicolini examined his 
immaculately kept nails for a mo- 
ment. “Governor, you look as 
though you could stand to log about 
twenty hours’ sleep time.” 

Trentino gave him a tired smile. 
“I intend to do Just that as soon as 
I have the whole grisly mess neatly 
tied up. I’m still hoping to have a 
completely happy ending to tack 
onto my report to TNC.” 

“At least things don’t look as 
bad now as they did two days ago. 
We’re short a telefax balloon and a 
plate-glass window, but nobody got 
killed. Vera’s all right, you and the 
Cygnian delegate and that security 
guard Crater conked are all right 
. plus. Crater himself may have 
finally become, uh, joined to the 
rest of the human race. Most impor- 
tant, the Cygnians are still on good 
terms with us.” Major Chicolini 
grinned. “All things considered, I 
think we’ve just about broken even, 
sir.” 

“Well, I just hope I never have 
another two days like the past 
two.” 

Dr. Oppenheimer re-entered the 
room. She was frowning. 

“What’s wrong?” said Trentino. 

“Crater. Dr. Gill says he’s suc- 
cumbing to depression all of a sud- 
den. I’d better go have a look.” 

Trentino swore irritably. “Call 
me as soon as you know what’s 
going on.” 

URVAL STAGE 



“Certainly.” She left. 

“Well,” Major Chicolini said 
with a long sigh. 

The governor nodded glumly. 
“Lx5oks like our butterfly is revert- 
ing to the larval stage, doesn’t it?” 



* * 



The light in the room was soft 
and soothing. Dr. Gill had thought 
it best to paralyze him again. He 
lay upon his bed and stared up at 
the featureless white ceiling through 
a film of tears, and he tried to call 
out whenever someone entered the 
room to check on him. 

Why don’t you listen to me? 

Why won’t you talk to me? 

What’s wrong with you? 

Oh, God, God, don’t let me be 
lonely again! I want them to be my 
friends. I want them to know me. I 
want them to love me. I want to be 
their friend. 

Why don’t they open up? What’s 
wrong with them? Why don’t they 
answer me God don’t let them cut 
me off I want to be their friend but 
they’re shutting me out resisting me 
and I’m not strong enough to break 
through can’t they understand aren’t 
they able to hear me I keep trying 
to reach them but I slide off I can’t 
get in why don’t they HEAR ME? 

Deep in his throat, the butterfly 
made a strangled, angry noise, and 
one of the caterpillars rushed into 
the room to investigate. ★

Part Hof II 

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

Random, Ganelon and I had been 
conducted on a strange journey. Led 
by the Unicorn of Amber, we had 
passed through peculiar shadows, ar- 
riving at last on an oval shelf of stone 
at a place where the sea and the sky 
seemed to come together — a place 
chopped out of a mountain much like 
Kolvir, creating a locale similar to 
Amber, sans palace, sans city. In- 
scribed upon the shelf was the Pattern 
of Amber, leading me to the conclu- 
sion that this had to be the real basis 
of the world as I knew it, my own 
home but its nearest shadow. 

We were distracted by the emergence 
of a purple griffin from a nearby cave. 
It frightened Random’s horse, lago. 
lago fled onto the Pattern, where he 
was destroyed without trace by a vortex 
of forces which suddenly occurred 
overhead. The griffin tried to protect 
us the while, so we decided he couldn’t 
be all bad — some sort of watch-thing, 
most likely. 

This Pattern was strangely marred, 
by a long black smear extending in a 
direction corresponding to our own 
south, the route of the black road. In 
fact, the phenomena seemed related. 
Damage to the Pattern could possibly 
have created such an entrance to the 
realm as the road represented. 

Near to the center of the Pattern, at 
the beginning of the smear, we noticed 
a foreign object, which Ganelon recov- 
ered. It was a Trump — which neither 
Random nor I recognized — pierced by 
“ dagger. Ganelon then came up with 
the odd hypothesis that the blood of 
Amber might act as a solvent on the 
Pattern. I persuaded Random to test 

the hand of OBERON 



the notion and it proved correct. We 
then realized what this must mean with 
respect to the large, blotted section: a 
human sacrifice. And Random, who 
was one jump ahead of me, saw the 
resemblance between himself and the 
figure on the pierced Trump, conclud- 
ing that his illegitimate son Martin had 
been the subject of the ritual. It occur- 
red to me that the Trump was executed 
in brother Brand’s style, but I kept my 
mouth shut, as Random had just prom- 
ised to kill the person responsible and I 
still had need of Brand. 

Concluding that we had learned 
whatever we had been brought thither 
to learn, we sought to return to our 
own world by means of Benedict’s 
Trump. He transported us to that section 
of Kolvir which had seen our most recent 
battle with the forces of the black road. 
There, we learned that Benedict knew 
more than we had suspected concerning 
Martin. 

Random persuaded Benedict to con- 
duct him through Shadow to Martin’s 
last known address — at the home of 
some people called the Tecys. He bor- 
rowed Star and they rode off together. 
At the time, I did not know that the 
mysterious arm I had removed from 
Benedict’s ghost in Tir-na Nog’th was 
in my saddlebag. 

Returning to Amber with Ganelon, I 
visited Random’s wife Vialle to tell her 
he would be delayed, and I wound up 
telling her the entire story. I was con- 
siderably cheered by the visit, and I re- 
turned to my apartments for a nap 
rather than visit Brand, who had been 
asking for me. 

At some dark hour I awoke, struck 
by an idea as to how I might visit 
Dworkin, our old mentor, now half- 
mad, who had helped me to escape 
from my cell some time before. 



AS 




VI. 



I went down to the dungeons and 
cleaned the Trump he had drawn on 
the wall for purposes of his own exit. I 
was then able to use it myself, travel- 
ing to his quarters in a series of 
caverns in the place we had visited the 
previous morning. They were located 
at the back of the griffin’s cave. The 
beast, I later learned, was actually set 
to guard him, to keep him away from 
the Pattern. 

Mistaking me for Dad, Dworkin told 
me a great many things. The Pattern 
was somehow a projection of his own 
mind, now damaged, and his main de- 
sire now seemed to be to destroy it. An 
exile from Chaos, he had created the 
Pattern ages before, but had repented 
the act when it was damaged and had 
conspired with Dad to erase it — 
destroying the world in the process — 
with Dad to attempt its recreation in a 
purer form. Dad had not been too hot 
on the idea and had confined him, set- 
ting the griffin, Wixer, to guard. 
Dworkin’ s mind was obviously running 
in a strange rut, a thing he was the 
first to acknowledge, and it was dif- 
ficult to get him to admit that there 
was a way the Pattern might be re- 
stored without going the apocalyptic 
route. About this time he suffered a 
spell. He had already demonstrated a 
controlled shapeshifting ability as a 
peculiar Joke. Now an uncontrolled 
change seemed to come upon him and 
he warned me to flee. I did. 

Taking some special Trumps from 
the drawer of the desk in his study, I 
transported myself to an unusual place 
just as he seemed about to attack me in 
his new form. 

Looking about me then, searching 
my memory for correspondences, I 
concluded that I had just arrived at the 
Courts of Chaos.

^^HERE? The senses are such un- 



certain things, and now mine were 
strained beyond their limits. The 
rock on which I stood ... If I at- 



tempted to fix my gaze upon it, it 
took on the aspect of a pavement on 
a hot afternoon. It seemed to shift 



and waver, though my footing was 
undisturbed. And it was undecided 



as to the portion of the spectrum it 
might call home. It pulsated and 
flashed like the skin of an iguana. 
Looking upwards, I beheld a sky 
such as I had never before set eyes 
upon. At the moment, it was split 
down the middle — half of it of 



deepest night-black, and the stars 
danced within it. When I say 
danced, I do not mean twinkled; 



they cavorted and they shifted mag- 
nitudes; they darted and they cir- 
cled; they flared to nova brilliance, 
then faded to nothing. It was 
a frightening spectacle to behold, and 
my stomach tightened within me as 
1 experienced a profound ac- 
rophobia. Yet, shifting my gaze did 
little to improve the situation. The 
other half of the sky was like a bot- 
tle of colored sands, continuously 
shaken; belts of orange, yellow, 
red, blue, brown and purple turned 
and twisted; patches of green, 
mauve, gray and dead white came 
and went, sometimes snaking into 
belthood, replacing or joining the 
other writhing entities. And these, 
too, shimmered and wavered, creat- 
ing impossible sensations of dis- 
tance and nearness. At times, some 
or all seemed literally sky-high, and 
then again they came to fill the air 
before me, gauzy, transparent mists, 
translucent swaths or solid tentacles 



GALAXY 




of color. It was not until later that I 
realized that the line which sepa- 
rated the black from the color was 
advancing slowly from my right 
while retreating to my left. It was 
as if the entire celestial mandala 
were rotating about a point directly 
overhead. As to the light source of 
the brighter half, it simply could not 
be determined. Standing there, I 
looked down upon what at first 
seemed a valley filled with count- 
less explosions of color; but when 
the advancing darkness faced the 
display away the stars danced and 
burned within its depths as well as 
above, giving them the impression 
of a bottomless chasm. It was as if 
I stood at the end of the world, the 
end of the universe, the end of 
everything. But far, far out from 
where I stood, something hovered 
on a mount of sheerest black — a 
blackness itself, but edged and tem- 
pered with barely perceptible flashes 
of light. I could not guess at its 
size, for distance, depth, perspec- 
tive were absent here. A single 
edifice? A group? A city? Or sim- 
ply a place? The outline varied each 
time that it fell upon my retina. 
Now faint and misty sheets drifted 
slowly between us, twisting, as’ if 
long strands of gauze were buoyed 
by heated air. The mandala ceased 
its turning when it had exactly re- 
versed itself. The colors were be- 
hind me now, and imperceptible un- 
less I turned my head, an action I 
had no desire to take. It was pleas- 
ant standing there, staring at the 
formlessness from which all things 
eventually emerged . Before the 
Pattern, even, this thing was. I 
knew this, dimly but surely, at the 
very center of my consciousness. I 

the hand of oberon 



knew this, because I was certain 
that I had been here before. Child 
of the man I had become, it seemed 
that I had been brought here in 
some distant day — whether by Dad 
or Dworkin, I could not now 
recall — and had stood or been held 
in this place or one very near to it, 
looking out upon the same scene 
with, I am certain, a similar lack of 
comprehension, a similar sense of 
apprehension. My pleasure was 
tinged with a nervous excitement, a 
sense of the forbidden, a feeling of 
dubious anticipation. Peculiarly, at 
that moment, there rose in me a 
longing for the Jewel I had had to 
abandon in my compost heap on the 
shadow Earth, the thing Dworkin 
had made so much of. Could it be 
that some part of me sought a de- 
fense or at least a symbol of resis- 
tance against whatever was out 
there? Probably. 

As I continued to stare, fasci- 
nated, across the chasm, it was as if 
my eyes adjusted or the prospect 
shifted once again, subtly. For now 
I discerned tiny, ghostly forms mov- 
ing within that place, like slow- 
motion meteors along the gauzy 
strands. I waited, regarding them 
carefully, courting some small un- 
derstanding of the actions in which 
they were engaged. At length, one 
of the strands drifted very near. 
Shortly thereafter I had my answer. 

There was a movement. One of 
the rushing forms grew larger, and I 
realized that it was following the 
twisting way that led toward me. In 
only a few moments, it took on the 
proportions of a horseman. As it 
came on, it assumed a semblance of 
solidity without losing that ghostly 
quality which seemed to cling to 



47 




everything which lay before me. A 
moment later, I beheld a naked 
rider on a hairless horse, both 
deathly pale, rushing in my direc- 
tion. The rider brandished a bone- 
white blade; his eyes and the eyes 
of the horse both flashed red. I did 
not really know whether he saw me, 
whether we existed on the same 
plane of reality, so unnatural was 
his mien. Yet I unsheathed Grays- 
wandir and took a step backward as 
he approached. 

His long white hair shed tiny 
sparkling motes, and when he 
turned his head I knew that he was 
coming for me, for then I felt his 
gaze like a cold pressure across the 
front of my body. I turned sidewise 
and raised my blade to guard. 

He continued, and I realized that 
both he and the horse were bigger than 
I had thought. They came on. When 
they reached the point nearest me — 
some ten meters, perhaps — the horse 
reared as he drew it to a halt. They 
regarded me then, bobbing and sway- 
ing as if on a raft in a gently swelling 
sea. 

“Your name!” the rider de- 
manded. “Give me your name, who 
comes to this place!” 

His voice produced a crackling 
sensation in my ears. It was all of 
one sound level, loud and without 
inflection. 

I shook my head. 

“I give my name when I choose, 
not when I am ordered to,” I said. 
“Who are you?” 

He gave three short barks, which 
I took to be a laugh. 

“I will hale you down and about, 
where you will cry it out forever.” 

I pointed Grayswandir at his 
eyes. 

48 



“Talk is cheap,” I said. “Whis- 
key costs money.” 

I felt a faint cool sensation just 
then, as if someone were toying 
with my Trump, thinking of me. 
But it was dim, weak, and I had no 
attention to spare, for the rider had 
passed some signal to his mount 
and the beast reared. The distance is 
too great, I decided. But this 
thought belonged to another 
shadow. The beast plunged ahead 
toward me, departing the tenuous 
roadway that had been its course. 

Its leap bore it to a point far short 
of my position. But it did not fall 
from there and vanish, as I had 
hoped. It resumed the motions of 
galloping, and although its progress 
was not fully commensurate with 
the action, it did continue to 
advance across the abyss at about half- 
speed. 

While this was occurring, I saw 
that in the distance from which it 
had come another figure appeared to 
be headed my way. Nothing to do 
but stand my ground, fight and 
hope that I could dispatch this at- 
tacker before the other was upon 
me. 

As the rider advanced, his ruddy 
gaze flicked over my person and 
halted when it fell upon Grayswan- 
dir. Whatever the nature of the mad 
illumination at my back, it had 
tricked the delicate tracery on my 
blade to life once more, so that that 
portion of the Pattern it bore swam 
and sparkled along its length. The 
horseman was very near by then, 
but he drew back on the reins and 
his eyes leapt upward, meeting my 
own. His nasty grin vanished. 

“I know you!” he said. “You 
are the one called Corwin!” 



GALAXY 




But we had him, me and my ally 
momentum. 

His mount’s front hoofs fell upon 
the ledge and I rushed forward. The 
beast’s reflexes caused it to seek 
equal footing for its hind legs de- 
spite the drawn reins. The rider 
swung his blade into a guard posi- 
tion as I came on, but I cross- 
stepped and attacked from his left. 
As he moved his blade cross-body, 
I was already lunging. Grayswandir 
sheared through his pale hide, enter- 
ing beneath the sternum and above 
the guts. 

I wrenched my blade free and 
gouts of fire poured like blood from 
his wound. His swordarm sagged 
and his mount uttered a shriek that 
was almost a whistle as the blazing 
stream fell upon its neck. I danced 
back as the rider slumped forward 
and the beast, now fully footed, 
plunged on toward me, kicking. I 
cut again, reflexively, defensively. 
My blade nicked its left foreleg, 
and it too, began to burn. 

I sidestepped once again as it 
turned and made for me a second 
time. At that moment, the rider 
erupted into a pillar of light. The 
beast bellowed, wheeled and rushed 
away. Without pausing, it plunged 
over the edge and vanished into the 
abyss, leaving me with the memory 
of the smouldering head of a cat 
which had addressed me long ago 
and the chill which always accom- 
panied the recollection. 

I was backed against rock, pant- 
ing. The wispy road had drifted 
nearer — ten feet, perhaps, from the 
ledge. I had developed a cramp in 
my left side. The second rider was 
rapidly approaching. He was not 
pale like the first. His hair was dark 

THE HAND OF OBERON 



and there was color in his face. His 
mount was a properly maned sorrel. 
He bore a cocked and bolted 
crossbow. I glanced behind me and 
there was no retreat, no crevice into 
which I might back. 

I wiped my palm on my trousers 
and gripped Grayswandir by the 
forte of the blade. 1 turned side- 
ways, so as to present the narrowest 
target possible. 1 raised my blade 
between us, hilt level with my 
head, point toward the ground, the 
only shield I possessed. 

The rider came abreast of me and 
halted at the nearest point on the 
gauzy strip. He raised the crossbow 
slowly, knowing that if he did not 
drop me instantly with his single 
shot, 1 might be able to hurl my 
blade like a spear. Our eyes met. 

He was beardless, slim. Possibly 
light-eyed within the squint of his 
aim. He managed his mount well, 
with just the pressure of his legs. 
His hands were big, steady. Capa- 
ble. A peculiar feeling passed over 
me as I beheld him. 

The moment stretched beyond the 
point of action. He rocked back- 
ward and lowered the weapon 
slightly, though none of the tension 
left his stance. 

“You,” he called out. “Is that 
the blade Grayswandir?” 

“Yes,” I answered, “it is.” 

He continued his appraisal, and 
something within me looked for 
words to wear, failed, ran naked 
away through the night. 

“What do you want here?” he 
asked. 

“To depart,” I said. 

There was a chish-cha, as his 
bolt struck the rock far ahead and to 
the left of me. 



49 




“Go then,” he said. “This is a 
dangerous place for you.” 

He turned his mount back in the 
direction from which he had come. 

I lowered Grayswandir. 

“I won’t forget you,” I said. 

“No,” he answered. “Do not.” 

Then he galloped away, and mo- 
ments later the gauze drifted off 
also. 

I resheathed Grayswandir and 
took a step forward. The world was 
beginning to turn about me again, 
the light advancing on my right, the 
dark retreating to my left. I looked 
about for some way to scale the 
rocky prominence at my back. It 
seemed to rise only thirty or forty 
feet higher, and I wanted the view 
that might be available from its 
summit. My ledge extended to both 
my right and my left. On inspec- 
tion, the way to the right narrowed 
quickly, however, without affording 
a suitable ascent. I turned and made 
my way to the left. 

I came upon a rougher spot in a 
narrow place beyond a rocky shoul- 
der. Running my gaze up its height, 
an ascent seemed possible. I 
checked behind me after the ap- 
proach of additional threats. The 
ghostly roadway had drifted farther 
away; no new riders advanced. I 
commenced climbing. 

The going was not difficult, 
though the height proved greater 
than it had seemed from below. 
Likely a symptom of the spatial dis- 
tortion which seemed to have af- 
fected my sight of so much else in 
this place. After a time, I hauled 
myself up and stood erect at a point 
which afforded a better view in the 
direction opposite the abyss. 

Once again, I beheld the chaotic 



colors. From my right, the darkness 
herded them. The land they danced 
above was rock-cropped and cra- 
tered, no sign of any life within it. 
Passing through its midst, however, 
from the far horizon to a point in 
the mountains somewhere to the 
right, inky and serpentine, ran what 
could only be the black road. 

Another ten minutes of climbing 
and maneuvering, and I had 
positioned myself to view its ter- 
minus. It swept through a broad 
pass in the mountains and ran right 
to the very edge of the abyss. 
There, its blackness merged with 
that which filled the place, notice- 
able now only by virture of the fact 
that no stars shone through it. Using 
this occlusion to gauge it, I ob- 
tained the impression that it con- 
tinued on to the dark eminence 
about which the misty strips drifted. 

I stretched out on my belly, so as 
to disturb the outline of the low 
crest as little as possible to what- 
ever unseen eyes might flick across 
it. Lying there, I thought upon the 
opening of this way. The damage to 
the Pattern had laid Amber open to 
this access, and I believed that my 
curse had provided the precipitating 
element. I felt now that it would 
have come to pass without me, but 
I was certain that I had done my 
part. The guilt was still partly mine 
though no longer entirely so, as I 
had once believed. I thought then of 
Eric, as he lay dying on Kolvir. He 
had said that as much as he hated 
me, he was saving his dying curse 
for the enemies of Amber. In other 
words, this, and these. Ironic. My 
efforts were now entirely directed 
toward making good on my least- 
liked brother’s dying wish. His 



50 



GALAXY 




curse to cancel my curse, me as the 
agent. Fitting though, perhaps, in 
some larger sense. 

I sought, and was pleased not to 
discover, ranks of glowing riders 
setting forth or assembling upon 
that road. Unless another raiding 
party was already under way Amber 
was still temporarily safe. A 
number of things immediately trou- 
bled me, however. Mainly, if time 
did indeed behave as peculiarly in 
that place as Dara’s possible origin 
indicated, then why had there not 
been another attack? They had cer- 
tainly had ample time in which to 
recover and prepare for another as- 
sault. Had something occurred re- 
cently, by Amber’s time, that is, to 
alter the nature of their strategy? If 
so, what? My weapons? Brand’s re- 
covery? 

Or something else? 

I wondered, too, how far Ben- 
edict’s outposts reached. Certainly 
not this far, or I should have been 
informed. Had he ever been to this 
place? Had any of the others, within 
recent memory, stood where I had 
just stood, looking upon the Courts 
of Chaos, knowing something that I 
did not know? I resolved to ques- 
tion Brahd and Benedict in this re- 
gard as soon as I returned. 

All of which led me to wonder 
how time was behaving with me, at 
that moment. Better not to spend 
any more time here than I had to, I 
decided. I scanned the other Trumps 
I had removed from Dworkin’s 
desk. While they were all of them 
interesting, I was familiar with none 
of the scenes depicted. I slipped my 
own case then and riffled through to 
Random’s Trump. Perhaps he was 
the one who had tried to contact me 

the hand of oberon 



earlier. I raised his card and re- 
garded it. 

Shortly, it swam before my eyes 
and I looked upon a blurred 
kaleidescope of images, the impres- 
sion of Random in their midst. Mo- 
tion, and strangely twisting perspec- 
tives . 

“Random,” I said. “This is 
Corwin.” 

I felt his mind, but there was no 
response from it. It struck me then 
that he was in the middle of a hell- 
ride, all his concentration bent on 
warping the stuff of Shadow about 
him. He could not respond without 
losing control. I blocked the Trump 
with my hand, breaking the contact. 

I cut to Gerard’s card. Moments 
later, there was contact. I stood. 

“Corwin, where are you?” he 
inquired. 

“At the end of the world,” I 
said. “I want to come home.” 

‘‘Come ahead.” 

He extended his hand. I reached 
out and clasped it, stepped forward. 

We were on the ground floor of 
the palace in Amber, in the sitting 
room to which we had all adjourned 
on the night of Brand’s return. It 
seemed to be early morning. There 
was a fire going on the grate. No 
one else was present. 

“I tried to reach you earlier,” he 
said. “I think Brand did, too. But I 
can’t be sure.” 

“How long have I been away?” 

“Eight days,” he said. 

“Glad I hurried. What’s happen- 
ing?” 

“Nothing untoward,” he said. “I 
do not know what Brand wants. He 
kept asking for you, and I could not 
reach you. Finally, I gave him a 
deck and told him to see whether he 



51 




could do any better. Apparently, he 
could not.” 

“I was distracted,” I said, “and 
the time-flow differential was bad.” 
He nodded. 

“I have been avoiding him now 
that he is out of danger. He is in 
one of his black moods again, and 
he insists he can take care of him- 
self. He is right, in that, and it is 
just as well.” 

“Where is he now?” 

“Back in his own quarters, and 
he was still there as of perhaps an 
hour ago — brooding.” 

“Has he been out at all?” 

“A few brief walks. But not for 
the past several days.” 

“I guess I had best go see him 
then. Any word on Random?” 
“Yes,” he said. “Benedict re- 
turned several days ago. He said 
they had found a number of leads 
concerning Random’s son. He 
helped him check on a couple of 
them. One led further, but Benedict 
felt he had best not be away from 
Amber for too long, things being as 
uncertain as they are. So he left 
Random to continue the search on 
his own. He gained something in 
the venture, though. He came back 
sporting an artificial arm — a beauti- 
ful piece of work. He can do any- 
thing with it that he could before.” 
“Really?” I said. “It sounds 
strangely familiar.” 

He smiled, nodded. 

“He told me you had brought it 
back for him from Tir-na Nog’th. In 
fact, he wants to speak with you 
about it as soon as possible.” 

“I’ll bet,” I said. “Where is he 
now?” 

“At one of the outposts he has 
established along the black road. 

52 



You would have to reach him by 
Trump.” 

“Thanks,” I said. “Anything 
further on Julian or Fiona?” 

He shook his head. 

“All right,” I said, turning to- 
ward the door. “I guess I will go 
see Brand first.” 

“I’m curious to know what it is 
that he wants,” he said. 

“I will remember that,” I told 
him. 

I left the room and headed for the 
stair. 



VII. 

I rapped on Brand’s door. 

“Come in, Corwin,” he said. 

I did, deciding as I crossed the 
threshold that I would not ask him 
how he had known who it was. His 
room was a gloomy place, candles 
burning despite the fact that it was 
daytime and he had four windows. 
The shutters were closed on three of 
them. The fourth was only partway; 
open. Brand stood beside this one, 
staring out toward the sea. He was 
dressed all in black velvet with a 
silver chain about his neck. His belt 
was also of silver — a fine, linked 
affair. He played with a small dag- 
ger, and did not look at me as I en- 
tered. He was still pale, but his 
beard was neatly trimmed and he 
looked well-scrubbed and a bit 
heavier than he had when last I had 
seen him. 

“You are looking better,” I said. 
“How are you feeling?” 

He turned and regarded me, ex- 
pressionless, his eyes half-closed. 

“Where the hell have you 
been?” he said. 



GALAXY 





“Hither and yon. What did you 
want to see me about?’’ 

“I asked you where you’ve 
been.’’ 

“And I heard you,’’ I said, 
reopening the door behind me. 
“Now I am going to go out and 
come back in. Supposing we start 
this conversation over again?’’ 

He sighed. 

“Wait a minute. I am sorry,’’ he 
said. “Why are we all so thinskin- 
ned? I do not know. — All right. It 
may be better if I do start over 
again.’’ 

He sheathed his dagger and cross- 
ed to sit in a heavy chair of black 
wood and leather. 

“I got to worrying about all the 
things we had discussed,’’ he said, 
“and some that we had not. I 
waited what seemed an appropriate 
time for you to have concluded your 
business in Tir-na Nog’th and re- 
turned. I then inquired after you and 
was told you had not yet come 
back. I waited longer. First I was 
impatient, and then I grew con- 
cerned that you might have been 
ambushed by our enemies. When I 
inquired again later, I learned that 
you had been back only long 
enough to speak with Random’s 
wife — it must have been a conversa- 
tion of great moment — and then to 
take a nap. You then departed once 
more. I was irritated that you had 
not seen fit to keep me posted as to 
events, but I resolved to wait a bit 
longer. Finally, I asked Gerard to 
get hold of you with your Trump. 
When he failed, I was quite con- 
cerned. I tried it myself then, and 
"'hile it seemed that I touched you 
on several occasions I could not get 
through. I feared for you, and now 

the hand of oberon 



I see that I had nothing to fear all 
along. Hence, I was abrupt.” 

“I see,” I said, taking a seat off 
to his right. “Actually, time was 
running faster for me than it was for 
you, so from where I am sitting I 
have hardly been away. You are 
probably further recuperated from 
your puncture than I am from 
mine.” 

He smiled faintly and nodded. 
“That is something, anyway,” he 
said, “for my pains.” 

“I have had a few pains my- 
self,” I said, “so don’t give me 
any more. You wanted me for 
something. Let’s have it.” 
“Something is bothering you,” 
he said. “Perhaps we ought to dis- 
cuss that first.” 

“All right,” I said. “Let’s.” 

I turned and looked at the paint- 
ing on the wall beside the door. An 
oil, a rather somber rendering of the 
well at Mirata, two men standing 
beside their horses nearby, talking. 

“You’ve a distinctive style,” I 
said. 

“In all things,” he replied. 

“You stole my next sentence,” I 
said, locating Martin’s Trump and 
passing it to him. 

He remained expressionless as he 
examined it, gave me one brief, 
sidelong look and then nodded. 

“I cannot deny my hand,” he 
said. 

“It executed more than that card, 
your hand. Didn’t it?” 

He traced his upper lip with the 
tip of his tongue. 

“Where did you find it?” he 
asked. 

“Right where you left it, at the 
heart of things — in the real 
Amber.” 

54 



“So . .” he said, rising from 
the chair and returning to the win- 
dow, holding up the card as if to 
study it in a better light. “So,” he 
repeated, “you are aware of more 
than I had guessed. How did you 
learn of the primal Pattern?” 

I shook my head. 

“You answer my question first: 
Did you stab Martin?” 

He turned toward me once again, 
stared a moment, then nodded sharp- 
ly. His eyes continued to search 
my face. 

“Why?” I asked. 

“Someone had to,” he ex- 
plained, “to open the way for the 
powers we needed. We drew 
straws.” 

“And you won.” 

“Won. Lost?” He shrugged. 
“What does any of this matter 
now? Things did not come about as 
we had intended. I am a different 
person now than I was then.” 

“Did you kill him?” 

“What?’.’ 

“Martin, Random’s son. Did he 
die as a result of the wound you in- 
flicted?” 

He turned his hands palms up- 
ward. 

“I do not know,” he said. “If he 
did not, it was not because I did not 
try. You need look no further. You 
have found your guilty party. Now 
that you have, what are you going 
to do?” 

I shook my head. 

“I? Nothing. For all I know, the 
lad may still be living.” 

“Then let us move on to matters 
of greater moment. For how long 
have you known of the existence of 
the true Pattern?’ ’ 

“Long enough,” I said. “Its ori- 

GAIAXY 




gin, its functions, the effect of the 
blood of Amber upon it — Long 
enough. I paid more attention to 
Dworkin than you might have 
thought. I saw no gain to be had in 
damaging the fabric of existence, 
though. So I let Rover lie sleeping 
for a long, long while. It did not 
even occur to me until I spoke with 
you recently that the black road 
might have been connected with 
such foolishness. When I went to 
inspect the Pattern I found Martin’s 
Trump and all the rest.” 

“I was not aware that you were 
acquainted with Martin.” 

“I have never set eyes on him.” 
‘‘Then how were you aware he 
was the subject of the Trump?” 

‘‘I was not alone in that place.” 
‘‘Who was with you?” 

I smiled. 

‘‘No, Brand. It is still your turn. 
You told me when last we talked 
that the enemies of Amber hied all 
the way from the Courts of Chaos, 
that they have access to the realm 
via the black road because of some- 
thing you and Bleys and Fiona had 
done back when you were of one 
mind as to the best way to take the 
throne. Now I know what it is that 
you did. Yet Benedict has been 
watching the black road and I have 
just looked upon the Courts of 
Chaos. There is no new massing of 
forces, no movement toward us 
upon that road. I know that time 
flows differently in that place. They 
should have had more than enough 
time to ready a new assault. I want 
to know what is holding them back. 
Why have they not moved? What 
are they waiting for. Brand?” 

‘‘You credit me with more 
knowledge than I possess.” 

the hand of OBERON 



‘‘I don’t think so. You are the re- 
sident expert on the subject. You 
have dealt with them. That Trump 
is evidence that you have been hold- 
ing back on other matters. Don’t 
weasel, just talk.” 

‘‘The Courts . .” he said. 
‘‘You have been busy. Eric was a 
fool not to have killed you 
immediately — if he was aware you 
had knowledge of these things.” 
‘‘Eric was a fool,” I acknowl- 
edged. ‘‘You are not. Now talk.” 
‘‘But I am a fool,” he said, ‘‘a 
sentimental one, at that. Do you re- 
call the day of our last argument, 
here in Amber, so long ago?” 
“Somewhat.” 

“I was sitting on the edge of my 
bed. You were standing by my writ- 
ing desk. As you turned away and 
headed toward the door, I resolved 
to kill you. I reached beneath my 
bed, where I keep a cocked 
crossbow with a bolt in it. I actually 
had my hand on it and was about to 
raise it when I realized something 
which stopped me.” 

He paused. 

“What was that?” I asked. 

“Look over there by the door.” 

I looked, I saw nothing special. I 
began to shake my head, just as' he 
said, “On the floor.” 

Then I realized what it was — 
russet and olive and brown and 
green, with a small geometric pat- 
tern. 

He nodded. 

“You were standing on my favor- 
ite rug. I did not want to get blood 
on it. Later, my anger passed. So I, 
too, am a victim of emotion and 
circumstance.” 

“Lovely story — ” I began. 

“ — but now you want me to stop 

55 




stalling. I was not stalling, how- 
ever. I was attempting to make a 
point. We are all of us alive by one 
another’s sufferance and an occa- 
sional fortunate accident. I am 
going to propose suspending that 
sufferance and eliminating the pos- 
sibility of accident in a couple of very 
important cases. First though, to an- 
swer your question, while I do not 
know for certain what is holding 
them back, I can venture a very 
good guess. Bleys has assembled a 
large strike force for an attack on 
Amber. It will be nowhere near the 
scale of the one on which you ac- 
companied him, however. You see, 
he will be counting on the memory 
of that last attack to have con- 
ditioned the response to this one. It 
will probably also be preceeded by 
attempts to assassinate Benedict and 
yourself. The entire affair will be a 
feint, though. I would guess that 
Fiona has contacted the Courts of 
Chaos — may even be there right 
now — and has prepared them for the 
real attack, which might be ex- 
pected any time after Bleys’ 
diversionary foray. Therefore — ” 

“You say this is a very good 
guess,’’ I interrupted. “But we do 
not even know for certain that Bleys 
is still living.’’ 

“Bleys is alive,’’ he said. “I was 
able to ascertain his existence via 
his Trump — even a brief assessment 
of his current activities — before he 
became aware of my presence and 
blocked me out. He is very sensi- 
tive to such surveillance. I found 
him in the field with troops he in- 
tends to employ against Amber.’’ 

“And Fiona?’’ 

“No,” he said, “I did no exper- 
imenting with her Trump, and I 

56 



would advise you not to either. She 
is extremely dangerous, and I did 
not want to lay myself open to her 
influence. My estimate of her cur- 
rent situation is based on deduction 
rather than direct knowledge. I 
would be willing to rely on it, 
though.” 

“I see,” I said. 

“I have a plan.” 

“Go ahead.” 

“The manner in which you re- 
trieved me from durance was quite 
inspired, combining the forces of 
everyone’s concentration as you 
did. The same principle Could be 
utilized again, to a different end. A 
force such as that would break 
through a person’s defense fairly 
easily — even someone like Fiona, if 
the effort is properly directed.” 
“That is to say, directed by your- 
self?” 

“Of course. I propose that we as- 
semble the family and force our 
way through to Bleys and Fiona, 
wherever they may be. We hold 
them, locked in the full, in the 
flesh, just for a moment or so. Just 
long enough for me to strike.” 

“As you did Martin?” 

“Better, I trust. Martin was able 
to break free at the last moment. 
That should not occur this time, 
with all of you helping. Even three 
or four would probably be suffi- 
cient.” 

“You really think you can pull it 
off, that easily?” 

“I know we had better try. Time 
is running. You will be one of the 
ones executed when they take 
Amber. So will I. What do you 
say?” 

“If I become convinced that it is 
necessary. Then I would have no 



GALAXY 




choice but to go along with it.” 

‘‘It is necessary, believe me. The 
next thing is that I will need the 
Jewel of Judgment.” 

‘‘What for?” 

‘‘If Fiona is truly in the Courts of 
Chaos, the Trump alone will prob- 
ably. be insufficient to reach her and 
hold her — even with all of us be- 
hind it. In her case, I will require 
the Jewel to focus our energies.” 

‘‘I suppose that could be ar- 
ranged.” 

‘‘Then the sooner we are about it 
the better. Can you set things up for 
tonight? I am sufficiently recovered 
to handle my end of it.” 

“Hell no,” I said, standing. 
‘‘What do you mean?” He 
clenched the arms of the chair, 
half-rising. “Why not?” 

“I said I would go along with it 
if I became convinced that it was 
necessary. You have admitted that a 
lot of this is conjecture. That alone' 
is sufficient to keep me from being 
convinced.” 

“Forget about being convinced 
then. Can you afford to take the 
chance? The next attack is going to 
be a lot stronger than the last, Cor- 
win. They are aware of your new 
weapons. They are going to allow 
for this in their planning.” 

“Even if I agreed with you. 
Brand, I am certain I could not 
convince the others that the execu- 
tions are necessary.” 

“Convince them? Just tell them! 
You’ ve got them all by the throat, 
Corwin! You are on top right now. 
You want to stay there, don’t 
you?” 

“I smiled and moved toward the 
door. 

“I will, too,” I said, “by doing 

The hand of oberon 



things my way. I will keep your 
suggestion on file.” 

“Your way is going to get you 
dead. Sooner than you think.” 

“I am standing on your rug 
again,” 1 said. 

He laughed. 

“Very good. But I was not 
threatening you. You know what I 
meant. You are responsible for all 
of Amber now. You have to do the 
right thing.” 

“And you know what I meant. I 
am not going to kill a couple more 
of us because of your suspicions. I 
would need more than that.” 

“When you get it, it may be too 
late.” 

I shrugged. 

“We’ll see.” 

I reached toward the door. 

“What are you going to do 
now?” 

I shook my head. 

“I don’t tell anybody everything 
that I know. Brand. It is a kind of 
insurance.” 

“I can appreciate that. I only 
hope that you know enough.” 

“Or perhaps you fear that I know 
too much,” I said. 

For a moment a wary look 
danced on the muscles beneath his 
eyes. Then he smiled. 

“I am not afraid of you, 
brother,” he said. 

“It is good to have nothing to 
fear,” I said. 

I opened the door. 

“Wait,” he said. 

“Yes?” 

“You neglected to tell me who 
was with you when you discovered 
Martin’s Trump, in the place where 
I had left it.” 

“Why, it was Random,” I said. 



57 




“Oh. Is he aware of the particu- 
lars?’’ 

“If you mean, does he know that 
you stabbed his son,’’ I said, “the 
answer is no, not yet.’’ 

“I see. And of Benedict’s, new 
arm? I understand that you some- 
how got it for him in Tir-na Nog’th. 
I would like to know more about 
this.’’ 

“Not now,’’ I said. “Let’s save 
something for our next get-together. 
It won’t be all that long.’’ 

I went on out and closed the 
door, my silent regards to the rug. 

VIII. 

After visiting the kitchens, com- 
piling an enormous meal and de- 
molishing it, I headed for the sta- 
bles, where I located a handsome 
young sorrel which had once be- 
longed to Eric. I made friends with 
him in spite of this, and a short 
while later we were moving toward 
the trail down Kolvir which would 
take us to the camp of my Shadow 
forces. As I rode and digested, I 
tried to sort out the events and reve- 
lations of what, to me, had been the 
past few hours. If Amber had in- 
deed arisen as the result of Dwor- 
kin’s act of rebellion within the 
Courts of Chaos, then it followed 
that we were all of us related to the 
very forces which now threatened 
us. It was of course difficult to de- 
cide how far anything Dworkin said 
might now be trusted. Yet, the 
black road did run to the Courts of 
Chaos, apparently as a direct result of 
Brand’s ritual, a thing which he had 
based on principles learned from 
Dworkin. Fortunately, for now, the 
parts of Dworkin’s narrative which 

58 



required the greatest credulity were 
those things which were not of any 
great moment, from an immediate, 
pragmatic standpoint. Still, I had 
mixed feelings about being de- 
scended from a unicorn — 
“Corwin!” 

I drew rein. I opened my mind to 
the sending and the image of Gane- 
lon appeared. 

“I am here,” I said. “Where did 
you get hold of a set of Trumps? 
And learn how to use them?” 

“I picked up a pack from the 
case in the library awhile back. 
Thought it a good idea to have a 
way of getting in touch with you in 
a hurry. As for using them, I just 
did what you and the others seem to 
do — study the Trump, think about 
it, concentrate on getting in touch 
with the person.” 

“I should have gotten you a pack 
long ago,” I said. “It was an over- 
sight on my part which I am glad 
you’ve remedied. Are you just test- 
ing them now, or did something 
come up?” 

“Something,” he said. “Where 
are you?” 

“As chance would have it, I am 
on my, way down to see you.” 

“You are all right?” 

“Yes.” 

‘‘Fine. Come ahead then. I’d 
rather not try bringing you through 
this thing, the way you people do. 
It is not that urgent. I will see you 
by and by.” 

“Yes.” 

He broke the contact and I rustled 
the reins and continued on. For a 
moment, I had been irritated that he 
had not simply asked me for a 
deck. Then I recalled that I had 
been away for over a week, by 



GALAXY 




Amber’s time. He had probably 
been getting worried, didn’t trust 
any of the others to do it for him. 
Perhaps rightly so. 

The descent went quickly, as did 
the balance of the journey to the 
camp. The horse — whose name, by 
the way, was Drum — seemed happy 
to be going somewhere and had a 
tendency to pull away at the least 
excuse. I gave him his head at one 
point to tire him a bit, and it was 
not too long afterwards that 1 
sighted the camp. I realized at about 
that time that I missed Star. 

I was the subject of stares and sa- 
lutes as I rode into camp. A silence 
followed me and all activity ceased 
as I passed. I wondered whether 
they believed I had come to deliver 
a battle order. 

Ganelon emerged from his tent 
before I had dismounted. 

“Fast,” he observed, clasping 
my hand as I came down. “Pretty 
horse, that.” 

“Yes,” I agreed, turning the 
reins over to his orderly. “What 
news have you?” 

“Well . .” he said. “I’ve been 
talking to Benedict ...” 

“Movement on the back road?” 
“No, no. Nothing like that. He 
came to see me after he returned 
from those friends of his — the 
Tecys — to tell me that Random was 
all right, that he was following a 
lead as to Martin’s whereabouts. 
We got to talking of other matters 
after that, and finally he asked me 
to tell him everything I knew about 
Dara. Random had told him about 
her walking the Pattern, and he had 
decided then that too many people 
other than yourself were aware of 
her existence.” 

THE HAND OF OBERON 



“So what did you tell him?” 
“Everything.” 

“Including the guesswork, the 
speculation — after Tir-na Nog’th?” 
“Just so.” 

“I see. How did he take this?” 
“He seemed excited about it. 
Happy, I’d even say. Come talk 
with him yourself.” 

I nodded and he turned toward 
his tent. He pushed back the flap 
and stepped aside. 1 entered. 

Benedict was seated on a low 
stool beside a foot locker atop 
which a map had been spread. He 
was tracing something on the map 
with the long metal finger of the 
glinting, skeletal hand attached to 
the deadly, silver-cabled, fire- 
pinned mechanical arm I had 
brought back from the city in the 
sky, the entire device now attached 
to the stump of his right arm a little 
below the point where the sleeve 
had been cut away from his brown 
shirt, a transformation which halted 
me with a momentary shudder, so 
much did he resemble the ghost I 
had encountered. His eyes rose to 
meet my own and he raised the 
hand in greeting, a casual, perfectly 
executed gesture, and he smiled the 
broadest smile I had ever seen 
crease his face. 

“Corwin!” he said, and then he 
rose and extended that hand. 

I had to force myself to clasp the 
device which had almost killed me. 
But Benedict looked more kindly 
disposed toward me than he had in 
a long while. I shook the new hand 
and its pressures were perfect. I 
tried to disregard its coldness and 
angularity and almost succeeded, in 
my amazement at the control he had 
acquired over it. 



59 




“I owe you an apology,” he 
said. ‘‘I have wronged you. I am 
very sorry.” 

‘‘It’s all right,” I said. ‘‘I under- 
stand.” 

He clasped me for a moment, and 
my belief that things had apparently 
been set right between us was dark- 
ened only by the grip of those pre- 
cise and deadly fingers on my 
shoulder. 

Ganelon chuckled and brought up 
another stool, which he set at the 
other end of the locker. My irrita- 
tion at his having aired the subject I 
had not wanted mentioned, what- 
ever the circumstances, was sub- 
merged by the sight of its effects: I 
could not remember having seen 
Benedict in better spirits; Ganelon 
was obviously pleased at having ef- 
fected the resolution of our differ- 
ences. 

I smiled myself and accepted a 
seat, unbuckling my swordbelt and 
hanging Grayswandir on the 
tentpole. Ganelon produced three 
glasses and a bottle of wine. As he 
set the glasses before us and 
poured, he remarked, ‘‘To return 
the hospitality of your tent, that 
night, back in Avalon.” 

Benedict took up his glass with 
but the faintest of clicks. 

‘‘There is more ease in this 
tent,” he said. ‘‘Is that not so, 
Corwin?” 

I nodded and raised my glass. 

‘‘To that ease. May it always 
prevail.” 

‘‘I have had my first opportunity 
in a long while,” he said, ‘‘to talk 
with Random at some length. He 
has changed quite a bit.” 

‘‘Yes,” I agreed. 

‘‘I am more inclined to trust him 



now than I was in days gone by. j 
We had some time to talk after we | 
left the Tecys.” | 

‘‘Where were you headed?” j 

‘‘Some comments Martin had j 
made to his host seemed to indicate j 
that he was going to a place I knew 1 
of further off in Shadow — the block i 
city of Heerat. We journeyed there 
and found this to be correct. He had 
passed that way.” 

“I am not familiar with Heerat,” 

I said. 

‘‘A place of adobe and stone — a 
commercial center at the junction of 
several trade routes. There, Random 
found news which took him east- 
ward and probably deeper into 
Shadow. We parted company at 
Heerat, for I did not want to be 
away from Amber overlong. Also, 
there was a personal matter I was 
anxious to pursue. He told me how 
he had seen Dara walk the Pattern 
on the day of the battle.” 

‘‘That’s right,” I said. ‘‘She did. 

I was there, too.” , 

He nodded. 

‘‘As I said. Random had im- j 
pressed me. I was inclined to be- j 
lieve he was telling the truth. If this \ 
were so, then it was possible that > 
you were also. Granting this, I had j 
to pursue the matter of the girl’s al- s 
legations. You were not available, j 
so I came to Ganelon — this was j 
several days ago — and had him tell j 
me everything he knew about ] 
Dara.” 

I glanced at Ganelon, who in- J 
dined his head slightly. j 

‘‘So you now believe you have 1 
uncovered a new relative,” I said, j 
‘‘a mendacious one, to be sure, and J 
quite possibly an enemy — but a rel- | 
ative, nevertheless. What next?” 1

GALAXY 




He took a sip of wine. 

“I would like to believe in the re- 
lationship,” he said. “The notion 
somehow pleases me. So I would 
like to establish it or negate it to a 
certainty. If it turns out that we are 
indeed related, then I would like to 
understand the motives behind her 
actions. And I would like to learn 
why she never made her existence 
known to me directly.” He put 
down his glass, raised his new hand 
and flexed the fingers. “So I would 
like to begin,” he continued, “by 
learning of those things ycxi experi- 
enced in Tir-na Nog’th which apply 
to me and to Dara. I am also ex- 
tremely curious about this hand, 
which behaves as if it were made 
for me. I have never heard of a 
physical object being obtained in 
the city in the sky.” He made a 
fist, unclenched it, rotated the wrist, 
extended the arm, raised it, lowered 
it gently to his knee. “Random per- 
formed a very effective piece of 
surgery, don’t you think?” he con- 
cluded. 

“Very,” I agreed. 

“So, will you tell me the story?” 

I nodded and took a sip of my 
wine. 

“It was in the palace in the sky 
that it occurred,” I said. “The 
place was filled with inky, shifting 
shadows. I felt impelled to visit the 
throne room. I did this, and when 
the shadows moved aside, I saw 
you standing to the right of the 
throne, wearing that arm. When 
things cleared further, I saw Dara 
seated upon the throne. I advanced 
and touched her with Grayswandir, 
which made me visible to her. She 
declared me dead these several cen- 
turies and bade me return to my

grave. When I demanded her 
lineage, she said she was descended 
of you and of the hellmaid Lintra. 

Benedict drew a deep breath but 
said nothing. I continued; 

“Time, she said, moved at such 
a different rate in the place of her 
birth, that several generations had 
passed there. She was the first of 
them possessed of regular human at- 
tributes. She again bade me depart. 
During this time, you had been 
studying Grayswandir. You struck 
then to remove her from danger, 
and we fought. My blade could 
reach you and your hand could 
reach me. That was all. Otherwise, 
it was a confrontation of ghosts. As 
the sun began to rise and the city to 
fade, you had me in a grip with that 
hand. I struck it free of the arm 
with Grayswandir and escaped. It 
was returned with me because it 
was still clasping my shoulder.” 

“Curious,” Benedict said. “I 
have known that place to render 
false prophecies — the fears and hid- 
den desires of the visitor, rather 
than a true picture of what is to be. 
But then, it often reveals unknown 
truths as well. And as in most other 
things, it is difficult to separate the 
valid from the spurious. How did 
you read it?” 

“Benedict,” I said, “I am in- 
clined to believe the story of her 
origin. You have never seen her, 
but I have. She does resemble you 
in some ways. As for the rest 
. .It is doubtless as you said — 
that which is left after the truth has 
been separated out.” 

He nodded slowly, and I could 
tell that he was not convinced but 
did not want to push the matter. He 
knew as well as I did what the rest 



61 




implied. If he were to pursue his 
claim to the throne and succeed in 
achieving it, it was possible that he 
might one day step aside in favor of 
his only descendant. 

“What are you going to do?” 1 
asked him. 

“Do?” he said. “What is Ran- 
dom now doing about Martin? I 
shall seek her, find her, have the 
story from her own lips and then 
decide for myself. This will have to 
wait, however, until the matter of 
the black road is settled. That is 
another matter I wish to discuss 
with you.” 

“Yes?” 

“If time moves so differently in 
their stronghold, they have had 
more than they need in which to 
mount another attack. I do not want 
to keep waiting to meet them in in- 
decisive encounters. I am con- 
templating following the black road 
back to its source and attacking 
them on their home ground. I would 
like to do it with your concurr- 
ence.” 

“Benedict,” I said, “have you 
ever looked upon the Courts of 
Chaos?” 

He raised his head and stared at 
the blank wall of the tent. 

“Ages ago, when I was young,” 
he said, “I hellrode as far as I 
might go, to the end of everything. 
There, beneath a divided sky, I 
looked upon an awesome abyss. I 
do not know if the place lies there 
or if the road runs that far, but I am 
prepared to take that way again, if 
such is the case.” 

“Such is the case,” I said. 

“How can you be certain?” 

“I am just returned from that 
land. A dark citadel hovers within 

62 



it. The road goes to it.” 

“How difficult was the way?” 
“Here,” I said, taking out the 
Trump and passing it to him. “This 
was Dworkin’s. I found it among 
his things. I only just tried it. It 
took me there. Time is already 
rapid at that point. I was attacked 
by a rider on a drifting roadway, of 
a sort not shown on the card. 
Trump contact is difficult there, 
perhaps because of the time differ- 
ential. Gerard brought me back.” 

He studied the card. 

“It seems the place I saw that 
time,” he said at length. “This 
solves our logistics problems. With 
one of us on either end of a Trump 
connection we can transport the 
troops right through, as we did that 
day from Kolvir to Gamath.” 

I nodded. 

“That is one of the reasons I 
showed it to you, to indicate my 
good faith. There may be another 
way, involving less risk than run- 
ning our forces into the unknown. I 
want you to hold off on this venture 
until I have explored my way fur- 
ther.” 

“I will have to hold off in any 
event, to obtain some intelligence 
concerning that place. We do not 
even know whether your automatic 
weapons will function there, do 
we?” 

“No, I did not have one along to 
test.” 

He pursed his lips. 

“You really should have thought 
to take one and test it.” 

“The circumstances of my depar- 
ture did not permit this.” 
“Circumstances?” 

“Another time. It is not relevant 
here. You spoke of following the 



GALAXY 




black road to its source ...” 
“Yes?” 

“That is not its true source. Its 
real source lies in the true Amber, 
in the defect in the primal Pattern.” 
“Yes, I understand that. Both 
Random and Ganelon have de- 
scribed your journey to the place of 
the true Pattern, and the damage 
you discovered there. I see the 
analogy, the possible connection — ” 
‘‘Do you recall my flight from 
Avalon, and your pursuit?” 

In answer, he only smiled faintly. 
‘‘There was a point where we 
crossed the black road,” I said. 
‘‘Do you recall it?” 

He narrowed his yes. 

“Yes,” he said. ‘‘You cut a path 
through it. The world had returned 
to normal at that point. I had forgot- 
ten.” 

‘‘It was an effect of the Pattern 
upon it,” I said, ‘‘One which I be- 
lieve can be employed upon a much 
larger scale.” 

‘‘How much larger?” 

‘‘To wipe out the entire thing.” 
He leaned back and studied my 
face. 

‘‘Then why are you not about 
it?” 

‘‘There are a few preliminaries I 
must undertake.” 

‘‘How much time will they in- 
volve?” 

‘‘Not too much. Possibly as little 
as a few days. Perhaps a few 
weeks.” 

‘‘Why didn’t you mention all of 
this sooner?” 

‘‘I only learned how to go about 
it recently.” 

‘‘How do you go about it?” 
‘‘Basically, it amounts to repair- 
ing the Pattern.” 

the hand of OBERON 



‘‘All right,” he said. ‘‘Say you 
succeed. The enemy will still be out 
there.” He gestured toward Garnath 
and the black road. ‘‘Someone gave 
them passage once.” 

‘‘The enemy has always been out 
there,” I said. ‘‘And it will be up 
to us to see that they are not given 
passage again — by dealing properly 
with those who provided it in the 
first place.” 

‘‘I go along with you on that,” 
he saicj, ‘‘but that is not what I 
meant They require a lesson, Cor- 
win. I want to teach them a proper 
respect for Amber, such a respect 
that even if the way is opened again 
they will fear to use it. That is what 
I meant. It is necessary.” 

‘‘You do not know what it would 
be like to carry a battle to that 
place, Benedict. It is — literally — 
indescribable.” 

He smiled and stood. 

‘‘Then I guess I had best go see 
for myself,” he said. “I will keep 
this card for a time, if you don’t 
mind.” 

‘‘I don’t mind.” 

‘‘Good. Then you be on with 
your business about the Pattern, 
Corwin, and I will be about my 
own. This will take me some time, 
too. I must go give my commanders 
orders concerning my absence now. 
Let us agree that neither of us 
commence anything of a final na- 
ture without checking first with the 
other.” 

“Agreed,” I said. 

We finished our wine. 

“I will be underway myself, very 
soon now,” I said. ‘‘So, good 
luck.” 

“To you, also.” He smiled 
again. “Things are better,” he said, 

63 




and he clasped my shoulder as he 
passed to the entrance. 

We followed him outside. 

“Bring Benedict’s horse,” Gane- 
lon directed the orderly who stood 
beneath a nearby tree; and turning, 
he offered Benedict his hand, “I, 
too, want to wish you luck,” he 
said. 

Benedict nodded and shook his 
hand. 

“Thank you, Ganelon. For many 
things.” 

Benedict withdrew his Trumps. 

“I can bring Gerard up to date,” 
he said, “before my horse arrives.” 
He riffled through them, with- 
drew one, studied it, 

“How do you go about repairing 
the Pattern?” Ganelon asked me. 

“I have to get hold of the Jewel 
of Judgment again,” I said. “With 
it, I can reinscribe the damaged 
area.” 

“Is this dangerous?” 

“Yes.” 

“Where is the Jewel?” 

“Back on the shadow Earth, 
where I left it.” 

“Why did you abandon it?” 

“I feared that it was killing me.” 
He contorted his features into a 
near-impossible grimace. 

“I don’t like the sound of this, 
Corwin. There must be another 
way.” 

“If I knew a better way. I’d take 
it.’ ’ 

“Supposing you just followed 
Benedict’s plan and took them all 
on? You said yourself that he could 
raise infinite legions in Shadow. 
You also said that he is the best 
man there is in the field.” 

“Yet the damage would remain 
in the Pattern, and something else 

64 



would come to fill it. Always. The 
enemy of the moment is not as im- 
portant as our own inner weakness. 
If this is not mended we are already 
defeated, though no foreign con- 
queror stands within our walls.” 

He turned away. 

“I cannot argue with you. You 
know your own realm,” he said. 
“But I still feel you may be making 
a grave mistake by risking yourself 
on what may prove unnecessary at a 
time when you are very much 
needed.” 

I chuckled, for it was Vialle’s 
word and I had not wanted to call it 
my own when she had said it. 

“It is my duty,” I told him. 

He did not reply. 

Benedict, a dozen paces away, 
had apparently reached Gerard, for 
he would mutter something, then 
pause and listen. We stood there, 
waiting for him to conclude his 
conversation so that we could see 
him off. 

“. Yes, he is here now,” I 
heard him say. “No, I doubt that 
very much. But — ” 

Benedict glanced at me several 
times and shook his head. 

“No, I do not think so,” he said. 
Then, “All right, come ahead.” 

He extended his new hand, and 
Gerard stepped into being, clasping 
it. Gerard turned his head, saw me 
and immedaitely moved in my di- 
rection. 

He ran his eyes up and down and 
back and forth across my entire per- 
son, as if searching for something. 

“What is the matter?” I said. 

“Brand,” he replied, “he is no 
longer in his quarters. At least, 
most of him isn’t. He left a lot of 
blood behind. The place is also 



GALAXY 




broken up enough to show there had 
been a fight.” 

I glanced down at my shirtfront 
and trousers. 

“And you are looking for blood- 
stains? As you can see, these are the 
same things I had on earlier. They 
may be dirty and wrinkled but that’s 
all.” 

“That does not really prove any- 
thing,” he said. 

“It was your idea to look. Not 
mine. What makes you think I — ” 

“You were the last one to see 
him,” he said. 

“Except for the person he had a 
fight with — if he really did.” 

“What do you mean by that?” 

“You know his temper, his 
moods. We had a small argument. 
He might have started breaking 
things up after I left, maybe cut 
himself, gotten disgusted, trumped 
out for a change of scene. — Wait! 
His rug! Was there any blood on 
that small, fancy rug before his 
door?” 

“I am not sure. — No, I don’t 
think so. Why?” 

“Circumstantial evidence that he 
did it himself. He was very fond of 
that rug. He avoided messing it.” 

“I don’t buy it,” Gerard said, 
“and Caine’s death still looks 
peculiar — and Benedict’s servants 
who could have found out you 
wanted gunpowder. Now Brand — ” 

“This could well be another at- 
tempt to frame me,” I said, “and 
Benedict and I have come to better 
terms.” 

He turned toward Benedict, who 
had not moved from where he stood 
a dozen paces away, regarding us 
without expression, listening. 

“Has he explained away those 

THE HAND OF OBERON 



deaths?” Gerard asked him. 

“Not directly,’’ Benedict an- 
swered, “but much of the rest of 
the story now stands in a better 
light. So much so, that I am in- 
clined to believe the best.” 

Gerard shook his head and glared 
down at me again. 

“Still unsettled,” he said. “What 
were you and Brand arguing 
about?” 

“Gerard,” I said, “that is our 
business, till Brand and I decide 
otherwise.” 

“I dragged him back to life and 
watched over him, Corwin. I didn’t 
do it just to see him killed in a 
squabble.” 

“Use your brains,” I told him. 
“Whose idea was it to search for 
him the way that we did? To bring 
him back?” 

“You wanted something from 
him,” he said. “You finally got it. 
Then he became an impediment.” 

“No. But even if that were the 
case, do you think I would be so 
damned obvious about it? If he has 
been killed, then it is on the same 
order as Caine’s death — an attempt 
to frame me.” 

“You used the obviousness ex- 
cuse with Caine, too. It seems to 
me it could be a kind of subtlety — a 
thing you are good at.” 

“We have been through this be- 
fore, Gerard ...” 

“. And you know what I 
told you then.” 

“It would be difficult to have 
forgotten.” 

He reached forward and seized 
my right shoulder. I immediately 
drove my left hand into his stomach 
and pulled away. It occurred to me 
then that perhaps I should have told 



65 




him what Brand and I had been 
talking about. But I didn’t like the 
way he had asked me. 

He came at me again. I sidestep- 
ped and caught him with a light left 
near the right eye. I kept jabbing 
after that, mainly to keep his head 
back. I was in no real shape to fight 
him again, and Grayswandir was 
back in the tent. I had no other 
weapon with me. 

I kept circling him. My side hurt 
if I kicked with my left leg. I 
caught him once on the thigh with 
my right, but I was slow and off- 
balance and could not really follow 
through. I continued to jab. 

Finally, he blocked my left and 
managed to drop his hand on my 
biceps. I should have pulled away 
then, but he was open. I stepped in 
with a heavy right to his stomach, 
all of my strength behind it. It bent 
him forward with a gasp, but his 
grip tightened on my arm. He 
blocked my attempted uppercut with 
his left, continuing its forward mo- 
tion until the heel of his hand 
slammed against my chest, at the 
same time jerking my left arm 
backwards and to the side with such 
force that I was thrown to the 
ground. If he came down on me, 
that was it. 

He dropped to one knee and 
reached for my throat. 



IX. 

I moved to block his hand, but it 
halted in mid-reach. Turning my 
head, I saw that another hand had 
fallen upon Gerard’s arm, was now 
grasping it, was holding it back. 

66 



I rolled away. When I looked up 
again, I saw that Ganelon had 
caught hold of him. Gerard jerked 
his arm forward, but it did not 
come free. 

‘‘Stay out of this, Ganelon,” he 
said. 

‘‘Get going, Corwin!” Ganelon 
said. ‘‘Get the Jewel!” 

Even as he called out, Gerard 
was beginning to rise. Ganelon 
crossed with his left and connected 
with Gerard’s jaw. Gerard sprawled 
at his feet. Ganelon moved in and 
swung a kick toward his kidney, but 
Geard caught his foot and heaved 
him over backwards. I scrambled 
back into a crouch, supporting my- 
self with one hand. 

Gerard came up off the ground 
and rushed Ganelon, who was just 
recovering his feet. As he was al- 
most upon him, Ganelon came up 
with a double-fisted blow to 
Gerard’s midsection which halted 
him in his tracks. Instantly, Gane- 
lon’s fists were moving like pistons 
against Gerard’s abdomen. For sev- 
eral moments, Gerard seemed too 
dazed to protect himself, and when 
he finally bent and brought his arms 
in, Ganelon caught him with a right 
to the jaw tliat staggered him back- 
wards. Ganelon immediately rushed 
forward, throwing his arms about 
Gerard as he slammed into him and 
hooking his right leg behind 
Gerard’s own. Gerard toppled and 
Ganelon fell upon him. He strad- 
dled Gerard then and drove his right 
fist against his jaw. When Gerard’s 
head rolled back, he crossed with 
his left. 

Benedict suddenly moved to 
intervene, but Ganelon chose that 
moment to rise to his feet. Gerard 



GALAXY 




lay unconscious, bleeding from his 
niouth and nose. 

I got shakily to my own feet, 
dusted myself off. 

Ganelon grinned at me. 

“Don’t stay around,” he said. “I 
don’t know how I would do in a 
rematch. Go find the trinket.” 

I glanced at Benedict and he 
nodded. I returned to the tent for 
Grayswandir. When I emerged, 
Gerard still had not moved, but Be- 
nedict stood before me. 

“Remember,” he said, “you’ve 
my Trump and I’ve yours. Nothing 
final without a conference.” 

I nodded. I was going to ask him 
why he had seemed willing to help 
Gerard, biit not me. But second 
thoughts had me and I decided 
against spoiling our fresh-minted 
amity. 

“Okay.” 

I headed toward the horses. 
Ganelon clapped me on the shoulder 
as I came up to him. 

“Good luck,” he said. “I’d go 
with you, but I am needed here — 
especially with Benedict trumping 
off to Chaos.” 

“Good show,” I said. “I 
shouldn’t have any trouble. Don’t 
worry.” 

I went off to the paddock. 
Shortly, I was mounted and mov- 
ing. Ganelon threw me a salute as I 
passed and I returned it. Benedict 
was kneeling beside Gerard. 

I headed for the nearest trail into 
Arden. The sea lay at my back, 
Garnath and the black road to the 
left, Kolvir to my right. I had to 
gain some distance before I could 
work with the stuff of Shadow. The 
day lay clean once Garnath was lost 
to sight, several rises and dips later. 

the hand of oberon 



I struck the trail and followed its 
long curve into the wood, where 
moist shadows and distant birdsongs 
reminded me of the long periods of 
peace we had known of old and the 
silken, gleaming presence of the 
maternal unicorn. 

My aches faded into the rhythm 
of the ride, and I thought once 
again of the encounter I had de- 
parted. It was not difficult to under- 
stand Gerard’s attitude, since he had 
already told me of his suspicions 
and issued me a warning. Still, it 
was such bad timing for whatever 
had happened with Brand that I 
could not but see it as another ac- 
tion intended either to slow me or 
to stop me entirely. It was fortunate 
that Ganelon had been on hand, in 
good shape and able to put his fists 
in the right places at the proper 
times. I wondered what Benedict 
would have done if there had only 
been the three of us present. I’d a 
feeling he would have waited and 
intervened only at the very last 
moment, to stop Gerard from killing 
me. I was still not happy with our 
accord, though it was certainly an 
improvement over the previous state 
of affairs. 

All of which made me wonder 
again what had become of Brand. 
Had Fiona or Bleys finally gotten to 
him? Had he attempted his proposed 
assassinations singlehanded and 
been met with a counterthrust, then 
dragged through his intended vic- 
tim’s Trump? Had his old allies 
from the Courts of Chaos somehow 
gotten through to him? Had one of 
his horny handed guardians from 
the Tower finally been able to reach 
him? Or had it been as I had 
suggested to Gerard — an accidental 



67 




self-injury in a fit of rage, followed 
by an ill-tempered flight from 
Amber to do his brooding and plot- 
ting elsewhere? 

When that many questions arise 
from a single event the answer is 
seldom obtainable by pure logic. I 
had to sort out the possibilities 
though, to have something to reach 
for when more facts did turn up. In 
the meantime, I thought carefully 
over everything he had told me, re- 
garding his allegations in light of 
those things which I now knew. 
With one exception, I did not doubt 
most of the facts. He had built too 
cleverly to have the edifice simply 
toppled — but then, he had had a lot 
of time to think these things over. 
No, it was in his manner of present- 
ing events that something had been 
hidden by misdirection. His recent 
proposal practically assured me of 
that. 

The old trail twisted, widened, 
narrowed again, swung to the 
northwest and downward, into the 
thickening wood. The forest had 
changed very little. It seemed al- 
most the same trail a young man 
had ridden centuries before, riding 
for the sheer pleasure of it, riding to 
explore that vast green realm which 
extended over most of the conti- 
nent, if he did not stray into 
Shadow. It would be good to be 
doing it again for no reason other 
than this. 

After perhaps an hour, I had 
worked my way well back into the 
forest, where the trees were great 
dark towers, what sunlight I glimpsed 
caught like phoenix nests in 
their highest branches, an always 
moist, twilight softness smoothing 
the outlines of stumps and boles. 



logs and mossy rocks. A deer 
bounded across my path, not trust- 
ing to the excellent concealment of 
a thicket at the right of the trail. 
Birdnotes sounded about me, never 
too near. Occasionally, I crossed the 
tracks of other horsemen. Some of 
these were quite fresh, but they did 
not stay long with the trail. Kolvir 
was well out of sight, had been for 
some time. 

The trail rose again, and I knew 
that I would shortly reach the top of 
a small ridge, pass among rocks and 
head downward once more. The 
trees thinned somewhat as we 
climbed, until finally I was afforded 
a partial view of the sky. It was en- 
larged as I continued, and when I 
came to the summit I heard the dis- 
tant cry of a hunting bird. 

Glancing upward, I saw a great 
dark shape, circling and circling, 
high above me. I hurried past the 
boulders and shook the reins for a 
burst of speed as soon as the way 
was clear. We plunged downward, 
racing to get under cover of the 
larger trees once again. 

The bird cried out as we did this, 
but we won to the shade, to the 
dimness, without incident. I slowed 
gradually after that and continued to 
listen, but there were no untoward 
sounds on the air. This part of the 
forest was pretty much the same as 
that we had left beyond the ridge, 
save for a small stream we picked 
up and paralleled for a time, finally 
crossing it at a shallow ford. Be- 
yond, the trail widened and a little 
more light leaked through and 
flowed with us for half a league. 
We had almost come a sufficient 
distance for me to begin those small 
manipulations of Shadow which 



68 



GALAXY 




would bear me to the pathway back 
to the shadow Earth of my former 
exile. Yet, it would be difficult to 
begin here, easier farther along. I 
resolved to save the strain on my- 
self and my mount by continuing to 
a better beginning. Nothing of a 
threatening nature had really occur- 
red. The bird could be a wild 
hunter, probably was. 

Only one thought nagged at me 
as I rode. 

Julian . 

Arden was Julian’s preserve, pa- 
trolled by his rangers, sheltering 
several encampments of his troops at 
all times — Amber’s inland border 
guard, both against incursions natu- 
ral and against those things which 
might appear at the boundaries of 
Shadow. 

Where did Julian go when he had 
departed the palace so suddenly on 
the night of Brand’s stabbing? If he 
wished simply to hide, there was no 
necessity for him to flee farther than 
this. Here he was strong, backed by 
his own men, moving in a realm he 
knew far better than the rest of us. 
It was quite possible that he was not 
right now, too far away. Also, he 
liked to hunt. He had his hell- 
hounds, he had his birds . 

A half mile, a mile ... 

Just then, I heard the sound that I 
feared most. Piercing the green and 
the shade, there came the notes of a 
hunting horn. They came from 
some distance behind me, and I 
think from the left of the trail. 

I urged my mount to a gallop and 
the trees rushed to a blur on, either 
side. The trail was straight and level 
here. We took advantage of this. 

Then from behind, I heard a 
roar — a kind of deep-chested cough- 

the hand of oberon 



ing, growling sound backed by a lot 
of resonant lung space. I did not 
know what it was that had uttered 
it, but it was no dog. Not even a 
hellhound sounded like that. I 
glanced back, but there was no pur- 
suit in sight. So I kept low and 
talked to Drum a bit. 

After a time, I heard a crashing 
noise in the woods off to my right, 
but the roar was not repeated just 
then. I looked again, several times, 
but I was unable to make out what 
it was that was causing the distur- 
bance. Shortly thereafter, I heard 
the horn once more, much nearer, 
and this time it was answered by 
the barks and the baying which I 
could not mistake. The hellhounds 
were coming — swift, powerful, vic- 
ious beasts Julian had found . in 
some shadow and trained to the 
hunt. 

It was time, I decided, to begin 
the shift. Amber was still strong 
about me, but I laid hold of Shadow 
as best I could and started the 
movement. 

The trail began to curve to the 
left, and as we raced along it the 
trees at either hand diminished in 
size, fell back. Another curve, and 
the trail led us through a clearing, 
perhaps a hundred meters across. I 
glanced up then and saw that that 
damned bird was still circling, 
much nearer now, close enough to 
be dragged with me through 
Shadow. 

This was more complicated that I 
had intended. I wanted an open 
space in which to wheel my mount 
and swing a blade freely if it came 
to that.. The occurrence of such a 
place, however, revealed my posi- 
tion quite clearly to the bird, whom 



69 




it was proving difficult to lose. 

All right. We came to a low hill, 
mounted it, started downward, pass- 
ing a lone, lightning-blasted tree as 
we did. On its nearest branch sat a 
hawk of gray and silver and black. I 
whistled to it as we passed, and it 
leapt into the air, shrieking a savage 
battle cry. 

Hurrying on, I heard the indi- 
vidual voices of the dogs, clearly 
now, and the thud of the horses’ 
hoofs. Mixed in with these sounds 
there was something else, more a 
vibration, a shuddering of the 
ground. I looked back again, but 
none of my pursuit had yet topped 
the hill. I bent my mind toward the 
way away and clouds occluded the 
sun. Strange flowers appeared along 
the trail — green and yellow and 
purple — and there came a rumble of 
distant thunders. The clearing widen- 
ed, lengthened. It became com- 
pletely level. 

I heard once again the sound of 
the horn. I turned for another look. 

It bounded into view then, and I 
realized at that instant that I was not 
the object of the hunt, that the rid- 
ers, the dogs, the bird were pursu- 
ing the thing that ran behind me. Of 
course, this was a rather academic 
distinction, in that I was in front, 
and quite possibly the object of its 
hunt. I leaned forward, shouting to 
Drum and digging in with my knees, 
realizing even as I did that the 
abomination was moving faster than 
we could. It was a panic reaction. 

I was being pursued by a manti- 
cora. 

The last time I had seen its like 
was on the day before the battle in 
which Eric died. As I had led my 
troops up the rearward slopes of 

70 



Kolvir, it had appeared to tear a 
man named Rail in half. We had 
dispatched it with automatic 
weapons. The thing proved twelve 
feet in length, and like this one it 
had worn a human face on the head 
and shoulders of a lion; it, too, had 
had a pair of eagle-like wings 
folded against its sides and the long 
pointed tail of a scorpion curving in 
the air above it. A number of them 
had somehow wandered in from 
Shadow to devil our steps as we 
headed for that battle. There was no 
reason to believe all of them had 
been accounted for, save that none 
had been reported since that time 
and no evidence of their continued 
existence in the vicinity of Amber 
had come to light. Apparently, this 
one had wandered down into Arden 
and been living in the forest since 
that time. 

A final glance showed me that I 
might be pulled down in moments if 
I did not make a stand. It also 
showed me a dark avalanche of 
dogs rushing down the hill. 

I did not know the intelligence or 
psychology of the manticora. Most 
fleeing beasts will not stop to attack 
something which is not bothering 
them. Self-preservation is generally 
foremost in their minds. On the 
other hand, I was not certain that 
the manticora even realized that it 
was being pursued. It might have 
started out on my trail and only had 
its own picked up afterwards. It 
might have only the one thing on its 
mind. It was hardly a time to pause 
and reflect on all the possibilities. 

I drew Grayswandir and turned 
my mount to the left, pulling back 
on the reins immediately as he 
made the turn. 



GALAXY 




Drum screamed and rose high 
onto his hind legs. I felt myself 
sliding backwards, so I jumped to 
the ground and leaped to the side. 

But I had, for the moment, for- 
gotten the speed of the storm- 
hounds, had also forgotten how eas- 
ily they had once overtaken Ran- 
dom and myself in Flora’s Mer- 
cedes, had also forgotten that unlike 
ordinary dogs chasing cars, they 
had begun tearing the vehicle apart. 

Suddenly, they were all over the 
manticora, a dozen or more dogs, 
leaping and biting. The beast threw 
back its head and uttered another 
cry as they struck at it. It swept that 
vicious tail through them, sending 
one flying, stunning or killing two 
others. It reared then and turned, 
striking out with its forelegs as it 
descended. 

But even as it did this, a hound 
attached itself to its left foreleg, two 
more were at its haunches and one 
had scrambled onto its back, biting 
at its shoulder and neck. The others 
were circling it now. As soon as it 
would go after one, the others 
would dart in and slash at it. 

It finally caught the one on its 
back with its scorpion sting and dis- 
embowled the one gnawing at its 
leg. However, it was running blood 
from a double dozen wounds by 
then. Shortly, it became apparent that 
the leg was giving it trouble, both 
for striking purposes and for bearing 
its weight when it struck with the 
others. In the meantime, another 
dog had mounted its back and was 
tearing at its neck. It seemed to be 
having a more difficult time getting 
at this one. Another came in from 
its right and shredded its ear. Two 
more plied its haunches, and when 

the hand of oberon 



it reared again one rushed in and 
tore at its belly. Their barks and 
growls also seemed to be confusing 
it somewhat, and it began striking 
wildly at the ever-moving gray 
shapes. 

I had caught hold of Drum’s bri- 
dle and was trying to calm him suf- 
ficiently to remount and get the hell 
out of there. He kept trying to rear 
and pull away, and it took consider- 
able persuasion even to hold him in 
place. 

In the meantime, the manticora 
let out a bitter, wailing cry. It had 
struck wildly at the dog on its back 
and driven its sting into its own 
shoulder. The dogs took advantage 
of this distraction and rushed in 
wherever there was an opening, 
snapping and tearing. 

I am certain the dogs would have 
finished it, but at that moment the 
riders topped the hill and de- 
scended. There were five of them, 
Julian in the lead. He had on his 
scaled white armor and his hunting 
horn hung about his neck. He rode 
his gigantic steed Morgenstern, a 
beast which has always hated me. 
He raised the long lance that he 
bore and saluted with it in my direc- 
tion. Then he lowered it and 
shouted orders to the dogs. Grudg- 
ingly, they dropped away from the 
prey. Even the doj on the manti- 
cora’s back loosened its grip and 
leaped to the ground. All of them 
drew back as Julian couched the 
lance and touched his spurs to 
Morgenstern’s sides. 

The beast turned toward him, 
gave a final cry of defiance and 
leapt ahead, fangs bared. .They 
came together, and for a moment 
my view was blocked by Morgen- 



71 








stern’s shoulder. Another moment, 
however, and I knew from the 
horse’s behavior that the blow had 
been a true one. 

A turning, and I saw the beast 
stretched out, great gouts of blood 
upon its breast, flowering about the 
dark stem of the lance. 

Julian dismounted. He said some- 
thing to the other riders which I did 
not overhear. They remained 
mounted. He regarded the still- 
twitching manticora, then looked at 
me and smiled. He crossed and 
placed his foot upon the beast, 
seized the lance with one hand and 
wrenched it from the carcass. Then 
he drove it into the ground and 
tethered Morgenstern to its shaft. 
He reached up and patted the 
horse’s shoulder, looked back at 
me, turned and headed in my direc- 
tion. 

When he came up before me he 
said, “I wish you hadn’t killed 
Bela.” 

“Bela?” I repeated. 

He glanced at the sky. I followed 
his gaze. Neither bird was not in 
sight. 

“He was one of my favorites.” 

“I am sorry,” I said. “I misun- 
derstood what was going on.” 

He nodded. 

“All right. I’ve done something 
for you. Now you can tell me what 
happened after I left the palace. 
Did Brand make it?” 

“Yes,” I said, “and you’re off 
the hook on that. He claimed Fiona 
slabbed him. And she was not 
around to question either. She de- 
parted during the night, also. It’s 
a wonder you didn’t bump into one 
another.” 

He smiled. 



GALAXY 



“I’d have guessed as much,” he 

said. 

“Why did you flee under such 
suspicious circumstances?” I asked. 
“It made it look bad for you.” 

He shrugged. 

“It would not be the first time 
I’ve been falsely accused, sus- 
pected. And for that matter, if in- 
tent counts for anything, I am as 
guilty as our little sister. I’d have 
done it myself if I could. In fact. 
I’d a blade ready the night we 
fetched him back. Only, I was 
crowded aside.” 

“But why?” I asked. 

He laughed. 

“Why? I am afraid of the bas- 
tard, that’s why. For a long while, I 
had thought he was dead, and cer- 
tainly hoped so — finally claimed by 
the ^rk powers he dealt with. How 
much do you really know about 
him, Corwin?” 

“We had a long talk.” 

“And. .. ?” 

“He admitted that he and Bleys 
and Fiona had formed a plan to 
claim the throne. They would see 
Bleys crowned, but each would 
share the real power. They had used 
the forces you referred to, to assure 
Dad’s absence. Brand said that he 
had attempted to win Caine to their 
cause, but that Caine had instead 
gone to you and to Eric. The three 
of you then formed a similar trium- 
virate to seize power before they 
could, by placing Eric on the 
throne.” 

He nodded. 

“The events are in order, but the 
reason is not. We did not want the 
throne, at least not that abruptly, 
nor at that time. We formed our 
group to oppose their group, be- 

the hand of OBERON 



cause it had to be opposed to pro- 
tect the throne. At first, the most 
we could persuade Eric to do was to 
assume a Protectorship. He was 
afraid he would quickly turn up 
dead if he saw himself crowned 
under those conditions. Then you 
turned up, with your very legitimate 
claim. We could not afford to let 
you press it at that time, because 
Brand’s crowd was threatening 
out-and-out war. We felt they 
would be less inclined to make this 
move if the throne were already oc- 
cupied. We could not have seated 
you, because you would have re- 
fused to be a puppet, a role you 
would have had to play since the 
game was already in progress and 
you were ignorant on too many 
fronts. So we persuaded Eric to take 
the risk and be crowned. That was 
how it happened.” 

“So when I did arrive he put out 
my eyes and threw me in the dun- 
geon just for laughs.” 

Julian turned away and looked 
back at the dead manticora. 

“You are a fool,” he finally 
said. “You were a tool from the 
very beginning. They used you to 
force our hand, and either way you 
lost. If that half-assed attack of 
Bleys’ had somehow succeeded, 
you wouldn’t have lasted long 
enough to draw a deep breath. If it 
failed, as it did, Bleys disappeared, 
as he did, leaving you with your 
life forfeit for attempted usurpation. 
You had served your purpose and 
you had to die. They left us small 
choice in the matter. By rights, we 
should have killed you — and you 
know it.” 

I bit my lip. There were many 
things I might say. But if he was 



73 




telling something approximating the 
truth, he did have a point. And I 
did want to hear more. 

“Eric,” he said, “figured that 
your eyesight might eventually be 
restored — knowing the way we 
regenerate — given time. It was a 
very delicate situation. If Dad were 
to return, Eric could step down and 
justify all of his actions to anyone’s 
satisfaction — except for killing you. 
That would have been tpo patent a 
move to insure his own continued 
reign beyond the troubles of the 
moment. And I will tell you frankly 
that he simply wanted to imprison 
you and forget you.” 

“Then whose idea was the blind- 
ing?” 

He was silent again for a long 
while. Then he spoke very softly, 
almost a whisper: “Hear me out, 
please. It was mine, and it may 
have saved your life. Any action 
taken against you had to be tan- 
tamount to death, or their faction 
would have tried for the real thing. 
You were no longer of any use to 
them, but alive and about you pos- 
sessed the potentiality of becoming 
a danger at some future time. They 
could have used your Trump to con- 
tact you and kill you, or they could 
have used it to free you in order to 
sacrifice you in yet another move 
against Eric. Blinded, however, 
there was no need to slay you and 
you were of no use- for anything 
else they might have in mind. It 
saved you by taking you out of the 
picture for a time, and it saved us 
from a more egregious act which 
might one day be held against us. 
As we saw it, there was no choice. 
It was the only thing we could do. 
There could be no show of leniency 

74 



either, or we might be suspected of 
having some use for you ourselves. 
The moment you assumed any such 
semblance of value you would have 
been a dead man. The most we 
could do was look the other way 
whenever Lord Rein contrived to 
comfort you. That was all that 
could be done.” 

“I see,” I said. 

“Yes,” he agreed, “you saw too 
soon. No one had guessed you- 
would recover your sight that quick- 
ly, nor that you would be able to 
escape once you did. How did you 
manage it?” 

“Does Macy’s tell Gimbel’s?” I 
said. 

“Beg pardon?” 

“I said, nevermind. What do you 
know of Brand’s imprisonment, 
then?” 

He regarded me once more. 

“All I know is that there was 
some sort of falling out within his 
group. I lack the particulars. For 
some reason, Bleys and Fiona were 
afraid to kill him and afraid to let 
him run loose. When we freed him 
from their compromise — 
imprisonment— Fiona was appa- 
rently more afraid of having him' 
free.” 

“And you said you feared him 
enough to have made ready to kill 
him. Why now, after all this time, 
when all of this is history and the 
power has shifted again? He was 
weak, virtually helpless. What harm 
could he do now?” 

He sighed. 

“I do not understand the power 
that he possesses,” he said, “but it is 
considerable. I know that he can 
travel through Shadow with his 
mind, that he can sit in a chair, lo- 

GALAXY 




cate what he seeks in Shadow and 
then bring it to him by an act of 
will without moving from the chair; 
and he can travel through Shadow 
physically in a somewhat similar 
fashion. He lays his mind upon the 
place he would visit, forms a kind 
of mental doorway and simply steps 
through. For that matter, I believe 
he can sometimes tell what people 
are thinking. It is almost as if he 
has himself become some sort of 
living Trump. I know these things 
because I have seen hin do them. 
Near the end, when wo had him 
under surveillance in the palace he 
had eluded us once in this fashion. 
This was the time he traveled to the 
shadow Earth and had you placed in 
Bedlam. After his recapture, one of 
us remained with him at all times. 
We did not yet know that he could 
summon things through Shadow, 
however. When he became aware 
that you had escaped your confine- 
ment, he summoned a horrid beast 
which attacked Caine, who was 
then his bodyguard. Then he went 
to you once again. Bleys and Fiona 
apparently got hold of him shortly 
after that, before we could, and I 
did not see him again until that 
night in the library when we 
brought him back. I fear him be- 
cause he has deadly powers which I 
do not understand.” 

“In such a case, I wonder how 
they managed to confine him at 
all?” 

“Fiona has similar strengths, and 
I believe Bleys did also. Between 
the two of them, they could appar- 
ently annul most of Brand’s power 
while they created a place where it 
Would be inoperative.” 

“Not totally,” I said. “He got a 

The hand of oberon 



message to Random. In fact, he 
reached me once, weakly.” 

“Obviously not totally, then,” he 
said. “Sufficiently, however. Until 
we broke through the defenses.” 
“What do you know of all their 
by-play with me — confining me, 
trying to kill me, saving me.” 

“That I do not understand,” he 
said, “except that it was part of the 
power struggle within their own 
group. They had had a falling out 
amongst themselves, and one side 
or the other had some use for you. 
So, naturally, one side was trying to 
kill you while the other fought to 
preserve you. Ultimately, of course, 
Bleys got the most mileage out of 
you, in that attack he launched.” 
“But he was the one who tried to 
kill me, back on Earth,” I said. 
“He was the one who shot out my 
tires.” 

“Oh?” 

“Well, that is what Brand told 
me, but it jibes with all sorts of 
secondary evidence.” 

He shrugged. 

“I cannot help you on that,” he 
said. “I simply do not know what 
was going on among them at that 
time.” 

“Yet you countenance Fiona in 
Amber,” I said. “In fact, you are 
more than a little cordial to her 
whenever she is about.” 

“Of course,” he said, smiling. 
“I have always been very fond of 
Fiona. She is certainly the loveliest, 
most civilized of us all. Pity Dad 
was always so dead-set against 
brother-sister marriages, as well you 
know. It bothered me that we had 
to be adversaries for so long as we 
were. Things returned pretty much 
to normal after Bleys’ death, your 



75 




imprisonment and Eric’s coronation, 
though. She accepted their defeat 
gracefully, and that was that. She 
was obviously as frightened at the 
prospect of Brand’s return as I 
was.” 

‘‘Brand told things differently,” I 
said, ‘‘but then of course he would. 
For one thing, he claims that Bleys 
is still living, that he hunted him 
down with his Trump and knows 
that he is off in Shadow, training 
another force for another strike at 
Amber.” 

‘‘I suppose this is possible,” Jul- 
ian said. ‘‘But we are more than 
adequately prepared, are we not?” 

‘‘He claims further that the strike 
will be a feint,” 1 continued, ‘‘and 
that the real attack will then come 
direct from the Courts of Chaos, 
over the black road. He says that 
Fiona is off preparing the way for 
this right now.” 

He scowled. 

“I hope he was simply lying,” 
he said. ‘‘I would hate to see their 
group resurrected and at us again, 
this time with help from the dark 
direction. And I would hate to see 
Fiona involved.” 

‘‘Brand claimed he was out of it 
himself, that he had seen the error 
of his ways — and suchlike penitent 
noises.” 

‘‘Ha! I’d sooner trust that beast 1 
just slew than take Brand at his 
word. I hope you’ve had the sense 
to keep him well-guarded — though 
this might not be of much avail if 
he has his old powers back.” 

“But what game could he be 
playing now?” 

‘‘Either he has revived the old 
triumvirate, a thought I like not at 
all, or he has a new plan all his 

76 



own. But mark me, he has a plan. 
He has never been satisfied to be a 
mere spectator at anything. He is 
always scheming. I’d take an oath 
,he even plots in his sleep.” 

‘‘Perhaps you are right,” I said. 
“You see, there has been a new 
development, whether for good or 
ill, I cannot yet tell. I Just had a 
fight with Gerard. He thinks I have 
done Brand some mischief. This is 
not the case, but I was in no posi- 
tion to prove my innocence. I was 
the last person I know of to see 
Brand, earlier today. Gerard visited 
his quarters a short time ago. He 
says the place is broken up, there 
are blood smears here and there and 
Brand is missing. I don’t know 
what to make of it.” 

“Neither do I. But I hope it 
means someone has done the job 
properly this time.” 

‘‘Lord,” I said, “it’s tangled. I 
wish I had known all of these things 
before.” 

“There was never a proper time 
to tell you,” he said, “until now. 
Certainly not when you were a pris- 
oner and could still be reached, and 
after that you were gone for a long 
while. When you returned with your 
troops and your new weapons, I 
was uncertain as to your full inten- 
tions. Then things happened quickly 
and Brand was back again. It was 
too late. I had to get out to save my 
skin. I am strong here in Arden. 
Here, I can take anything he can 
throw at me. I have been maintain- 
ing the patrols at full battle force 
and awaiting word of Brand’s death. 
I wanted to inquire of one of 
you whether he was still around. 
But I could not decide whom to 
ask, thinking myself still suspect 



GALAXY 




should he have died. As soon as I 
did get word, though, should it 
prove he was still living, I was re- 
solved to have a try at him myself. 
Now this . state of affairs 
. What are you going to do 
now, Corwin?” 

“I am off to fetch the Jewel of 
Judgment from a place where I 
cached it in Shadow. There is a 
way it can be used to destroy the 
black road. I intend to try it.” 

‘‘How can this be done?” 

‘‘That is too long a story, for a 
horrible thought has just occurred to 
me.” 

‘‘What is that?” 

‘‘Brand wants the Jewel. He was 
asking about it, and now — This 
power of his to find things in 
Shadow and fetch them back. How 
good is it?” 

Julian looked thoughtful. 

‘‘He is hardly omniscient, if that 
is what you mean. You can find 
anything you want in Shadow the 
normal way we go about it — by 
traveling to it. According to Fiona, 
he just cuts out the footwork. It is 
therefore an object, not a particular 
object that he summons. Besides, 
that Jewel is a very strange item 
from everything Eric told me about 
it. I think Brand would have to go 
after it in person, once he finds out 
where it is.” 

‘‘Then I must get on with my 
hellride. I have to beat him to it.” 

‘‘I see you are riding Drum,” Jul- 
ian observed. ‘‘He is a good beast, 
a sturdy fellow. Been through many 
a hellride.” 

‘‘Glad to hear that,” I said. 
‘‘What are you going to do now?” 

‘‘Get in touch with someone in 
Amber and get up to date on every- 

THE HAND OF OBERON 



thing we haven’t had a chance to 
talk about — Benedict, probably.” 

‘‘No good,” 1 said. ‘‘You will 
not be able to reach him. He is off 
to the Courts of Chaos. Try Gerard, 
and convince him I am an honor- 
able man while you are about it.” 
^‘The redheads are the only 
magicians in this family, but I will 
try. — You did say the Courts of 
Chaos?” 

‘‘Yes, but again, the time is too 
valuable now.” 

‘‘Of course. Get you gone. We 
will have our leisure later — I trust.” 

He reached out and clasped my 
arm. I glanced at the manticora, at 
the dogs seated in a circle about it. 

‘‘Thanks, Julian. I — You are a 
difficult man to understand.” 

‘‘Not so. I think the Corwin I 
hated must have died centuries ago. 
Ride now, man! If Brand shows up 
around here I’ll nail his hide to a 
tree!” 

He shouted an order to his dogs 
as I mounted, and they fell upon the 
carcass of the manitcora, lapping at 
its blood and tearing out huge 
chunks and strips of flesh. As I 
rode past that strange, massive, 
manlike face, I saw that its eyes 
were still open, though glazed. 
They were blue, and death had not 
robbed them of a certain preter- 
natural innocence. Either that, or 
the look was death’s final gift — a 
senseless way of passing out 
ironies, if it was. 

I took Drum back to the trail and 
began my hellride. 



X. 

Moving along the trail at a 

77 




gentle pace, clouds darkening the 
sky and Drum’s whinny of memory 
or anticipation ... A turn to the 
left, and uphill . The ground is 
brown, yellow, back to brown again 
. The trees squat down, draw 
apart . Grasses wave between 
them in the cool and rising breeze 
... A quick fire in the sky . 
A rumble shakes loose raindrops . 

Steep and rocky now . The 
wind tugs at my cloak . 
Up ... Up to where the rocks are 
streaked with silver and the trees 
have drawn their line . The 
grasses, green fires, die down in 
the rain . Up, to the craggy, 
sparkling, rainwashed heights, where 
the clouds rush and boil like a 
mudgorged river at floodcrest . 
The rain stings like buckshot and 
the wind clears its throat to sing . 
We rise and rise and the crest comes 
into view, like the head of a 
startled bull, horns guarding the 
trail . Lightnings twist about 
their tips, dance between them . 
The smell of ozone as we reach that 
place and rush on through, the rain 
suddenly blocked, the wind shunted 
away . 

Emerging on the father 

side . There is no rain, the air is 
still, the sky smoothed and dark- 
ened to a proper starfilled 
black . Meteors cut and burn, 
cut and burn, cauterizing to after- 
image scars, fading, fading . 
Moons, cast like a handful of 
coins . Three bright dimes, a 
dull quarter, a pair of pennies, one 
of them tarnished and scarred 
. Down then, that long, wind- 
ing way . Hoofclops clear and 
metallic in the night air . Some- 
where, a cat-like cough ... A dark 

78 



shape crossing a lesser moon, rag- 
ged and swift . 

Downward . , . The land drops 
away at either hand . Darkness 
below . Moving along the top of 
an infinitely high, curved wall, the 
way itself bright with moon- 
light . The trail buckles, folds, 
grows transparent . Soon it 
drifts, gauzy, filamentous, stars be- 
neath as well as above . Stars 
below on either side . There is 
no land . There is only the 
night, night and the thin, translu- 
cent . trail I had to try to ride, to 
learn how it felt, against some fu- 
ture use . 

It is absolutely silent now, and 
the illusion of slowness attaches to 
every movement . Shortly, the 
trail falls away, and we move as if 
swimming underwater at some 
enormous depth, the stars bright 
fish ... It is freedom, it is the 
power of the hellride that brings an 
elation, like yet unlike the reckless- 
ness that sometimes comes in battle, 
the boldness of a risky feat well- 
learned, the rush of rightness fol- 
lowing the finding of the poem’s 
proper word ... It is these and the 
prospect itself, riding, riding, rid- 
ing, from nowhere to nowhere 
perhaps, across and among the min- 
erals and fires of the void, free of 
earth and air and water . 

We race a great meteor, we touch 
upon its bulk . Speeding across 
its pitted surface, down, around, 
then up again ... It stretches into a 
great plain, it lightens, it yel- 
lows . 

It is sand, sand now beneath our 
movement . The stars fade out 
as the darkness is diluted to a morn- 
ing full of sunrise . Swaths of

shade ahead, desert trees within 
them . Ride for the dark . 
Crashing through . Bright birds 
burst forth, complain, resettle . 

Among the thickening trees 
. Darker the ground, narrower 
the way . Palm fronds shrfnk to 
hand-size, barks darken ... A twist 
to the right, a widening of the 
way . Our hoofs striking sparks 
from cobblestones . The lane en- 
larges, becomes a tree-lined 
street . Tiny row-houses flash 
by . Bright shutters, marble 
steps, painted screens, set back be- 
yond flagged walks . Passing, a 
horse-drawn cart, loaded with fresh 
vegetables . Human pedestrians 
turning to stare ... A small buzz 
of voices . 

On . Passing beneath a 
bridge . Coursing the stream till 
it widens to river, taking it down to 
the sea . .Thudding along the 
beach beneath a lemon sky, blue 
clouds studding . The silt, the 
wrack, the shells, the smooth 
anatomy of driftwood . White 
spray off the lime-colored sea . 

Racing, to where the place of wa- 
ters ends at a terrace . Mount- 
ing, each step crumbling and roar- 
ing down behind, losing its identity, 
joined with the boom of the 
surf . Up, up to the flattopped, 
treegrown plain, a golden city 
shimmering, mirage-like, at its 
end ... 

The city grows, darkens beneath 
a shadowy umbrella, its gray towers 
stretch upward, glass and metal 
flashing light through the 
murk . The towers begin to 
sway . 

The city falls in upon itself, 
soundlessly, as we pass . Towers

topple, dust boils, rises, is pinked 
by some lower glow ... A gentle 
noise, as of a snuffed candle, drift- 
ing by . 

A dust storm, quickly falling, 
giving place to fog . Through it, 
the sounds of automobile 
horns ... A drift, a brief lift, a 
break in the gray white, pearlwhite, 
shifting . Our hoofprints on a 
shoulder of highway ... To the 
right, endless rows of unmoving 
vehicles . Pearlwhite, graywhite, 
drifting again . 

Directionless shrieks and 
wailings . Random flashes of 
light . 

Rising once more . The fogs 
lower and ebb . Grass, grass, 
grass . Clear now the sky, and 
delicate blue_. A sun racing to 
set . Birds ... A cow in the 
field, chewing, staring and 
chewing . 

Leaping a wooden fence to ride a 
country road ... A sudden chill 
beyond the hill . The grasses are 
dry and snow’s on the 
ground . Tin-roofed farmhouse 
atop a hill, curl of smoke above 
it . 

On . The hills rise up, the sun 
rolls down, darkness dragged 
behind ... A sprinkle of 
stars . Here a house, set far 
back . There another, long 
driveway wound among old 
trees . Headlights . 

Off to the side of the 
road . Draw rein and let it 
pass . 

I wiped my brow, dusted my 
shirtfront and sleeves. I patted 
Drum’s neck. The oncoming vehicle 
slowed as it neared me, and I could 
see the driver staring. I gave the 



79 




reins a gentle movement and Drum 
began walking. The car braked to a 
halt and the driver called something 
after me, but I kept going. 
Moments later, I heard him drive 
off. 

It was country road for a time 
after that. I traveled at an easy 
pace, passing familiar landmarks, 
recalling other times. A few miles 
later and I came to another road, 
wider and better. I turned there, 
staying off on the shoulder to the 
right. The temperature continued to 
drop, but the cold air had a good 
clean taste to it. A sliced moon 
shone above the hills to my left. 
There were a few small clouds 
passing overhead, touched to the 
moon’s quarter with a soft, dusty 
light. There was very little wind; an 
occasional stirring of branches, no 
more. After a time, I came to a 
series of dips in the road, telling me 
I was almost there. 

A curve and a couple more 
dips ... I saw the boulder beside 
the driveway, I read my address 
upon it. 

I drew rein then and looked up 
the hill. There was a station wagon 
in the driveway and a light on in- 
side the house. I guided Drum off 
the road and across a field into a 
stand of trees. I tethered him behind 
a pair of evergreens, rubbed his 
neck and told him I would not be 
long. 

I returned to the road. No cars in 
sight. I crossed over and walked up 
the far side of the driveway, passing 
behind the station wagon. The only 
light in the house was in the living 
room, off to the right. I made my 
way around the left side of the 
house to the rear.

I halted when I reached the patio, 
looking around. Something was 
wrong. 

The back yard was changed. A 
pair of decaying lawn chairs which 
had been leaning against a 
dilapidated chicken coop I had 
never bothered to remove, were 
gone. So, for that matter, was the 
chicken coop. They had been pres- 
ent the last time I had passed this 
way. All of the dead tree limbs 
which had previously been strewn 
about, as well as a rotting mass of 
them I had long ago heaped to cut 
for firewood, were also gone. 

The compost heap was missing. 

I moved to the space where it had 
been. All that was there was an 
irregular patch of bare earth of the 
approximate shape of the heap 
itself. 

But I had discovered in attuning 
myself to the Jewel that I could 
make myself feel its presence. I 
closed my eyes for a moment and 
tried to do so. 

Nothing. 

I looked again, searching 
carefully, but there was no telltale 
glitter anywhere in sight. Not that I 
had really expected to see anything, 
not if I could not feel it nearby. 

There had been no curtains in the 
lighted room. Studying the house 
now, I saw that none of the 
windows had curtains, shades, 
shutters or blinds. Therefore . 

I passed around the other end of 
the house. Approaching the first 
lighted window, I glanced in quick- 
ly. Dropcloths covered much of the 
floor. A man in cap and coveralls 
was painting the far wall. 

Of course. 

I had asked Bill to sell the place, 

GALAXY 




1 had signed the necessary papers 
while a patient in the local clinic, 
when I had been projected back to 
my old house — probably by some 
action of the Jewel — on the 
occasion of my stabbing. That 
would have been several weeks ago, 
local time, using the Amber to 
shadow Earth conversion factor of 
approximately two and a half to one 
and allowing for the eight days the 
Courts of Chaos had cost me in 
Amber. Bill, of course, had gone 
ahead on my request. But the place 
had been in bad shape, abandoned 
as it had been for a number of 
years, vandalized ... It needed 
some new window panes, some 
roofing work, new guttering, 
painting, sanding, buffing. And 
there had been a lot of trash to haul 
away, outside as well as inside . 

I turned away and walked down 
the front slope to the road, recalling 
my last passage this way, half- 
delirious, on my hands and knees, 
blood leaking from my side. It had 
been much colder that night and 
there had been snow on the ground 
and in the air. I passed near the 
spot where' I’d sat, trying to flag 
down a car with a pillow case. The 
memory was slightly blurred, but I 
still recalled the ones that had 
passed me by. 

I crossed the road, made my way 
through the field to the trees. 
Unhitching Drum, I mounted. 

“We’ve some more riding 
ahead,” I told him. “Not too far 
this time.” 

We headed back to the road and 
started along it, continuing on past 
my house. If I had not told Bill to 
go ahead and sell the place, the 
compost heap would still have been 

THE HAND OF OBERON 



there, the Jewel would still have 
been there. I could be on my way 
back to Amber with the ruddy stone 
hung about my neck, ready to have 
a try at what had to be done. Now, 
now I had to go looking for it, 
when I’d a feeling time was 
beginning to press once again. At 
least, I had a favorable ratio here 
with respect to its passage in 
Amber. I clucked at Drum and 
shook the reins. No sense wasting 
time, even so. 

A half hour, and I was into town, 
riding down a quiet street in a 
residential area, houses all about 
me. The lights were on at Bill’s 
place. I turned up his driveway. I 
left Drum in his back yard. 

Alice answered my knock, stared 
a moment, then said, “My God! 
Carl!” 

Minutes later, I was seated in the 
living room with Bill, a drink on 
the table to my right. Alice was out 
in the kitchen, having made the 
mistake of asking me whether I 
wanted something to eat. 

Bill studied me as he lit his pipe. 

“Your ways of coming and going 
still tend to be colorful,” he said. 

I smiled. 

“Expediency is all,” I said. 

“That nurse at the 

clinic . Scarcely anyone believed 
her story.” 

“Scarcely anyone?” 

“The minority I refer to is, of 
course, myself.” 

“What was her story?” 

“She claimed that you walked to 
the center of the room, became 
two-dimensional and just faded 
away, like the old soldier that you 
are, with a rainbow-like 
accompaniment.” 



81 




“Glaucoma can cause the 
rainbow symptom. She ought to 
have her eyes checked.” 

“She did,” he said. “Nothing 
wrong.” 

“Oh. Too bad. The next thing 
that comes to mind is 
neurological.” 

“Come on, Carl. She’s all right. 
You know that.” 

I smiled and took a sip of my 
drink. 

“And you,” he said, “you look 
' like a certain playing card I once 
commented on. Complete with 
sword. What’s going on, Carl?” 
“It’s still complicated,” I said. 
“Even more than the last time we 
talked.” 

“Which means you can’t give me 
that explanation yet?” 

I shook my head. 

“You have won an all-expense 
tour of my homeland, when this is 
over,” I said, “if I still have a 
homeland then. Right now, time is 
doing terrible things.” 

“What can I do to help you?” 
“Information, please. My old 
house. Who is the guy you having 
fixing the place up?” 

“Ed Wellen. Local contractor. 
You know him, I think. Didn’t he 
put in a shower for you, or 
something?” 

“Yes, yes he did ... I 
remember. ’ ’ 

“He’s expanded quite a bit. 
Bought some heavy equipment. Has 
a number of fellows working for 
him now. I handled his incorpora- 
tion.” 

“Do you know who he’s got 
working at my place — now?” 

“Offhand, no. But I can find out 
in just a minute.” He moved his 

82 



hand to rest on the telephone on the 
side table. “Shall I give him a 
ring?” 

“Yes,” I said, “but there is a lit- 
tle more to it than that. There is 
only one thing in which I am truly 
interested. There was a compost 
heap in the back yard. It was there 
the last time I passed this way. It is 
gone now. I have to find out what 
became of it.” 

He cocked his head to the right 
and grinned around his pipe. 

“You serious?” he finally said. 
“Sure as death,” I said. “I hid 
something in that heap when I 
crawled by, decorating the snow 
with my precious bodily fluids. I’ve 
got to have it back now.” 

“Just what is it?” 

“A ruby pendant.” 

“Priceless, I suppose.” 

“Your’re right.” 

He nodded, slowly. 

“If it were anyone else, I would 
suspect a practical joke,” he said. 
“A treasure in a compost 
heap . Family heirloom?” 

“Yes. Forty or fifty carats. Sim- 
ple setting. Heavy chain.” 

He removed his pipe and whistled 
softly. 

“Mind if I ask why you put it 
there?” 

“I’d be dead now if I hadn’t.” 
“Pretty good reason.” 

He reached for the phone again. 
“We’ve had some action on the 
house already,” he remarked. “Pretty 
good, since I haven’t advertised 
yet. Fellow’d heard from someone 
who’d heard from someone else. I 
took him over this morning. He’s 
thinking about it. We may move it 
pretty quick.” 

He began to dial. 



GALAXY 




“Wait,” I said. “Tell me about 
him.” 

He cradled the phone, looked up. 

“Thin guy,” he said. “Redhead. 
Had a beard. Said he was an artist. 
Wants a place in the country.” 

“Son of a bitch!” I said, just as 
Alice came into the room with a 
tray. 

She made a tsking sound and 
smiled as she delivered it to me. 

“Just a couple hamburgers and 
some leftover salad,” she said. 
“Nothing to get excited about.” 

“Thank you. I was getting ready 
to eat my horse. I’d have felt bad 
afterwards.” 

“I don’t imagine he’d have been 
too happy about it himself. Enjoy,” 
she said, and returned to the 
kitchen. 

‘‘Was the compost heap still 
there when you took him over?” I 
asked. 

He closed his eyes and furrowed 
his brow. 

“No,” he said after a moment. 
“The yard was already clear.” 

“That’s something, anyway,” I 
said, and I began eating. 

He made the call, and he talked 
for several minutes. I got the drift 
of things from his end of the con- 
versation, but I listened to the entire 
thing after he had hung up, while I 
finished the food and washed it 
down with what was left in my 
glass. 

“He hated to see good compost 
go to waste,” Bill said. “So he 
pitched the heap into his pickup just 
the other day and took it out to his 
farm. He dumped it next to a plot 
he intends to cultivate, and he has 
not had a chance to spread it yet. 
Says he did not notice any jewelry, 

THE HAND OF OBERON 



but then he could easily have miss- 
ed it.” 

I nodded. 

“If I can borrow a flashlight, I 
had better get moving.” 

“Sure. I will drive you out,” he 
said. 

“I do not want to be parted from 
my horse at this point.” 

“Well, you will probably want a 
rake, and a shovel or a pitchfork. I 
can drive them out and meet you 
there, if you know where the place 
is.” 

“I know where Ed’s place is. He 
must have tools, though.” 

Bill shrugged and smiled. 

“All right,” I said. “Let me use 
your bathroom, and then we had bet- 
ter get moving.” 

“You know where it is. — By the 
way, you seemed as if you knew 
the prospective buyer.” 

I put the tray aside and rose. 

“You heard of him last as Bran- 
don Corey.” 

“The guy who pretended to be 
your brother and got you commit- 
ted?” 

“ ‘Pretended’ hell! He is my 
brother. No fault of mine, though. 
Excuse me.” 

“He was there.” 

“Where?” 

“Ed’s place, this afternoon. At 
least a bearded redhead was.” 
“Doing what?” 

“Said he was an artist. Said he 
wanted permission to set up his 
easel and paint in one of the fields.” 
“And Ed let him?” 

“Of course. Thought it was a 
great idea. That is why he told me 
about it. Wanted to brag.” 

“Get the stuff. I will meet you 
there.” 



83 




“Right.” 

The second thing I took out in 
the bathroom was my Trumps. I 
had to reach someone in Amber 
soonest, someone strong enough to 
stop him. But who? Benedict was 
on his way to the Courts of Chaos, 
Random was off looking for his 
son. I had just parted with Gerard 
on somewhat less than amicable 
terms. I wished that I had a Trump 
for Ganelon. 

I decided that I would have to try 
Gerard. 

I drew forth his card, performed 
the proper mental maneuvers. Mo- 
ments later, I had contact. 

“Corwin!” 

“Just listen, Gerard! Brand is 
alive, if that is any consolation. I’m 
damn sure of that. This is impor- 
tant. Life and death. You’ve got to 
do something — fast!” 

His expressions had changed 
rapidly while I had spoken — anger, 
surprise, interest . 

“Go ahead,” he said. 

“Brand could be coming back 
very soon. In fact, he may already 
be in Amber. You haven’t seen him 
yet, have you?” 

“No.” 

“He must be stopped from walk- 
ing the Pattern.” 

“I do not understand. But I can 
post a guard outside the chamber of 
the Pattern.” 

“Put the guard inside the 
chamber. He has strange ways of 
coming and going now. Terrible 
things may happen if he walks the 
Pattern.” 

“I will watch it personally then. 
What is happening?” 

“No time now. Here is the next 
thing: Is Llewella back in Rebma?” 

84 



“Yes, she is.” 

“Get hold of her with her 
Trump. She’s got to warn Moire 
that the Pattern in Rebma has to be 
guarded also.” 

“How serious is this, Corwin?” 

“It could be the end of every- 
thing,” I said. “I have to go now.” 
- I broke the contact and headed 
for the kitchen and the back door, 
stopping only long enough to thank 
Alice and say good night. If Brand 
got hold of the Jewel and attuned 
himself to it, I was not certain what 
he would do, but I had a pretty 
strong hunch. 

I mounted Drum and turned him 
toward the road. Bill was already 
backing out of the driveway. 

XI. 

I cut through fields in many 
places where Bill had to follow the 
roads, so I was not all that far be- 
hind him. When I drew up, he was 
talking with Ed, who was gesturing 
toward the southwest. 

As I dismounted, Ed was study- 
ing Drum. 

“Nice horse, that,” he said. 

“Thanks.” 

“You’ve been away.” 

“Yes.” 

We shook hands. 

“Good to see you again. I was 
just telling Bill that I don’t really 
know how long that artist stayed 
around. I just figured he would go 
away when it got dark, and I didn’t 
pay too much attention. Now, if he 
was really looking for something of 
yours and knew about the compost 
heap, he could still be out there for 
all I know. I’ll get my shotgun, if 
you like, and go with you.” 



GALAXY 




“No,” I said, “thanks. I think I 
know who it was. The gun will not 
be necessary. WeTl just walk over 
and do a little poking around.” 
“Okay,” he said. “Let me come 
along and give you a hand.” 

“You don’t have to do that,” I 
said. 

“How about your horse, then? 
What say I give him a drink and 
something to eat, clean him up a 
bit?” 

“I’m sure he’d be grateful. I 
know I would.” 

“What’s his name?” 

“Drum.” 

He approached Drum and began 
making friends with him. 

“Okay,” he said. “I’ll be back 
in the barn for awhile. If you need 
me for anything, just holler.” 
“Thanks.” 

I got the tools out of Bill’s car 
and he carried the electric lantern, 
leading me off to the southwest 
where Ed had been pointing earlier. 

As we crossed the field, I fol- 
lowed the beam of Bill’s light, 
searching for the heap. When I saw 
what might be the remains of one, I 
drew a deep breath, involuntarily. 
Someone must have been at it, the 
way the clods were strewn about. 
The mass would not have been 
dumped from a truck to fall in such 
a dispersed fashion. 

Still . The fact that someone 
had looked did not mean he had lo- 
cated what he had been seeking. 
“What do you think?” Bill said. 
“I don’t know,” I told him, low- 
ering the tools to the ground and 
approaching the largest aggregate in 
sight. “Give me some light here.” 

I scanned what remained of the 
heap, then fetched a rake- and began 

the hand of OBERON 



taking it apart. I broke each clod 
and spread it upon the ground, run- 
ning the tines through it. After a 
time. Bill set the lantern at a good 
angle and moved to help me. 

“I’ve got a funny feeling . .” 
he said. 

“So do I.” 

“. That we may be too 
late.” 

We kept at it, pulverizing and 
spreading, pulverizing and spread- 
ing .. 

I felt the tingle of a familiar pre- 
sence. I straightened and waited. 
Contact came moments later. 

“Corwin!” 

“Here, Gerard.” 

“What’d you say?” said Bill. 

I raised my hand to silence him 
and gave my attention to Gerard. 
He stood in shadow at the bright 
beginning of the Pattern, leaning 
upon his great blade. 

“You were right,” he said. 
“Brand did show up here, just a 
moment ago. I am not sure how he 
got in. He stepped out of the 
shadows off to the left, there.” He 
gestured. “He looked at me for a 
moment, then turned around and 
walked back. He did not answer 
when I hailed him. So I turned up 
the lantern, but he was nowhere in 
sight. He just disappeared. What do 
you want me to do now?” 

“Was he wearing the Jewel of 
Judgment?” 

“I could not tell. I only had sight 
of him for a moment, in this bad 
light.” 

“Are they watching the Pattern in 
Rebma now?” 

“Yes. Llewella’s alerted them.” 

“Good. Stay on guard, then. I 
will be in touch again.” 



85 




“All right. Corwin— About what 
happened earlier ...” 

“Forget it.” 

“Thanks. That Ganelon is one 
tough fellow.” 

“Indeed,” I said. “Stay awake.” 
His image faded as I released the 
contact, but a strange thing hap- 
pened then. The sense of contact, 
the path, remained with me, object- 
less, open, like a switched-on radio 
not tuned to anything. 

Bill was looking at me peculiarly. 
“Carl, what is happening?” 

“I don’t know. Wait a minute.” 
Suddenly, there was contact 
again, though not with Gerard. She 
must have been trying to reach me 
while my attention was diverted. 
“Corwin, it is important ...” 
“Go ahead, Fi.” 

“You will not find what you are 
looking for there. Brand has it.” 

“I was beginning to suspect as 
much.” 

“We have to stop him. I do not 
know how much you know about 
these matters — ” 

“Neither do I anymore,” I said, 
“but I have the Pattern in Amber 
and the one in Rebma under gilard. 
Gerard just told me that Brand ap- 
peared at the one in Amber, but 
was scared off.” 

She nodded her small, fine- 
featured face. Her red tresses were 
unusually disarrayed. She looked 
tired. 

“I am aware of this,” she said. 
“I have him under surveillance. But 
you have forgotten another possibil- 
ity.” 

“No,” I said. “According to my 
calculations, Tir-na Nog’th should 
not be attainable yet — ” 

“That is not what I was referring 

86 



to. He is headed for the primal Pat- 
tern itself.” 

“To attune the Jewel?” 

“The first time through,” she 
said. 

“To walk it, he would have to 
pass through the damaged area. I 
gather that is more than a little dif- 
ficult.” 

“So you do know about it,” she 
said. “Good. That saves time. The 
dark area would not trouble him the 
way it would another of us. He has 
come to terms with that darkness. 
We must stop him, now.” 

“Do you know any shortcuts to 
that place?” 

“Yes. Come to me. I will take 
you there.” 

“Just a minute. I want Drum 
with me.” 

“What for?” 

“No telling. That is why I want 
him.” 

“Very well. Then bring me 
through. We can as easily depart 
from there as from here.” 

I extended my hand. In a mo- 
ment, I held hers. She stepped for- 
ward. 

“Lord!” said Bill, drawing back. 
“You were giving me doubts about 
your sanity, Carl. Now it’s mine I 
wonder about. She — She’s on one 
of the cards, too, isn’t she?” 

“Yes. Bill, this is my sister 
Fiona. Fiona, this is Bill Roth, a. 
very good friend.” 

Fi extended her hand and smiled, 
and I left them there while I went 
back to fetch Drum. A few minwtes 
later, 1 led him forth. 

“Bill,” I said, “I am sorry to 
have wasted your time. My brother 
has the thing. We are going after 
him now. Thanks for helping me.” 

GALAXY 




I shook his hand. He said, 
“Corwin.” I smiled. 

‘‘Yes, that is my name.” 

“We have been talking, your sis- 
ter and I. Not much I could learn in 
a few minutes, but I know it is 
dangerous. So good luck. I still 
want the whole story one day.” 
‘‘Thanks,” I said. ‘‘I will try to 
see that you get it.” 

1 mounted, leaned down and 
drew Fiona up before me. 

‘‘Good night. Mister Roth,” she 
said. Then, to me, ‘‘Start riding, 
slowly, across the field.” 

I did. 

‘‘Brand says you are the one who 
stabbed him,” I said, as soon as we 
had gone far enough to feel alone. 
‘‘That’s right.” 

‘‘Why?” 

‘‘To avoid all this.” 

‘‘I talked with him for a long 
while. He claimed it was originally 
you, Bleys and himself, together in 
a scheme to seize power. ’ ’ 

‘‘That is correct.” 

‘‘He told me he had approached 
Caine, trying to win him to your 
side, but that Caine would have 
none of it, that Caine had passed 
the word along to Eric and Julian. 
And this led to their forming their 
own group, to block your way to 
the throne.” 

‘‘That is basically correct. Caine 
had ambitions of his own — long- 
term ones — but ambitions neverthe- 
less. He was in no position to pur- 
sue them, however. So he decided 
that if his lot was to be a lesser 
one, he would rather serve it under 
Eric than under Bleys. I can see his 
point, too.” 

‘‘He also claimed that the three 
of you had a deal going with the 

the hand of OBERON 



powers at the end of the black road, 
in the Courts of Chaos.” 

“Yes,” she said, ‘‘we did.” 

‘‘You use the past tense.” 

‘‘For myself and for Bleys, yes.” 
‘‘That is not the way Brand tells 
it.” 

‘‘He wouldn’t.” 

‘‘He said you and Bleys wanted 
to continue exploiting that alliance, 
but that he had had a change of 
heart. Because of this, he claims 
you turned on him and imprisoned 
him in that tower.” 

‘‘Why didn’t we just kill him?” 

‘‘I give up. Tell me.” 

‘‘He was too dangerous to be al- 
lowed his freedom, but we could 
not kill him either because he held 
something vital.” 

‘‘What?”' 

‘‘With Dworkin gone. Brand was 
the only one who knew how to 
undo the damage he had done to the 
primal Pattern.” 

‘‘You had a long time to get that 
information out of him.” 

‘‘He possesses unbelievable re- 
sources.” 

‘‘Then why did you stab him?” 

‘‘I repeat, to avoid all this. If it 
became a question of his freedom or 
his death, it were better he died. 
We would have to take our chances 
on figuring the method of repairing 
the Pattern.” 

‘‘This being the case, why did 
you consent to cooperate in bringing 
him back?” 

‘‘First, I was not cooperating, I 
was trying to impede the attempt. 
But there were too many trying too 
hard. You got through to him in 
spite of me. Second, I had to be on 
hand to try to kill him in the event 
you succeeded. Too bad things 



87 




worked out the way they did.” 

“You say that you and Bleys had 
second thoughts about the alliance, 
but that Brand did not?” 

“Yes.” 

“How did your second thoughts 
affect your desire for the throne?” 
“We thought we could manage it 
without any additional outside 
help.” 

“I see.” 

“Do you believe me?” 

“I’m afraid that I am beginning 
to.” 

“Turn here.” 

I entered a cleft in a hillside. The 
way was narrow and very dark, 
with only a small band of stars 
above us. Fiona had been man- 
ipulating Shadow while we had 
talked, leading us from Ed’s field 
downward, into a misty, moor-like 
place, then up again, to a clear and 
rocky trail among mountains. Now, 
as we moved through the dark de- 
file, I felt her working with Shadow 
again. The air was cool but not 
cold. The blackness to our left and 
our right was absolute, giving the il- 
lusion of enormous depths, rather 
than nearby rock cloaked in 
shadow. This impressipn was rein- 
forced, I suddenly realized, by the 
fact that Drum’s hoofbeats were not 
producing any echoes, aftersounds, 
overtones. 

“What can I do to gain your 
trust?” she said. 

“That’s asking quite a bit.” 

She laughed. 

“Let me rephrase it. What can I 
do to convince you I am telling the 
truth?” 

“Just answer one question.” 
“What?” 

“Who shot out my tires?” 

88 



She laughed again. 

“You’ve figured it out, haven’t 
you?” ■ 

“Maybe. You tell me.” 
“Brand,” she said. “He had 
failed in his effort to destroy your 
memory, so he decided he had bet- 
ter do a more thorough job.” 

“The version I had of the story 
was that Bleys had done the shoot- 
ing and left me in the lake, that 
Brand had arrived in time to drag 
me out and save my life. In fact, 
the police report seemed to indicate 
something to that effect.” 

“Who called the police?” she 
asked. 

“They had it listed as an 
anonymous call, but — ” 

“Bleys called them. He couldn’t 
reach you in time to save you, once 
he realized what was happening. He 
hoped that they could. Fortunately, 
they did.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Brand did not drag you out of 
the wreck. You did it yourself. He 
waited around to be certain you 
were dead, and you surfaced and 
pulled yourself ashore. He went 
down and was checking you over, 
to decide whether you would die if 
he just left you there or whether he 
should throw you back in again. 
The police arrived about then and 
he had to clear out. We caught up 
with him shortly afterwards and 
were able to subdue him and im- 
prison him in the tower. That took a 
lot of doing. Later, I contacted Eric 
and told him what had happened. 
He then ordered Flora to put you in 
the other place and see that you 
were held until after his corona- 
tion.” 

“It fits,” I said. “Thanks.” 

GALAXY 




“What does it fit?” 

“I was only a small-town GP in 
simpler times than these, and I 
never had much to do with psychiat- 
ric cases. But I do know that you 
don’t give a person electroshock 
therapy to restore memories. EST 
generally does just the opposite. It 
destroys some of the short-term 
ones. My suspicions began to stir 
when I learned that that was what 
Brand had had done to me. So I 
came up with my own hypothesis. 
The auto wreck did not restore my 
memories, and neither did the EST. 
I had finally begun recovering them 
naturally, not as the result of any 
particular trauma. I must have done 
something or said something to in- 
dicate that this was occurring. Word 
of it somehow got to Brand and he 
decided that this would nor be a 
good thing to have happen at that 
time. So he journeyed to my 
shadow and managed to get me 
committed and subjected to treat- 
ment which he hoped would wipe 
out those things I had recently re- 
covered. This was just partly suc- 
cessful, in that its only lasting effect 
was to fuzz me up for the few days 
surrounding the sessions. The acci- 
dent may have contributed, too. But 
when I escaped from Porter and 
lived through his attempt to kill me, 
the process of recovery continued 
after I regained consciousness in 
Greenwood and left the place. I was 
remembering more and more when I 
was staying at Flora’s. The recovery 
was accelerated by Random’s taking 
me to Rebma, where I walked the 
Pattern. If this had not occurred, 
however, I am convinced now that 
it would all have come back, aijy- 
way. It might have taken somewhat 

THE HAND OF OBERON 



longer, but I had broken through 
and the remembering was an ongo- 
ing process, coming faster and fast- 
er near the end. So I concluded 
that Brand was trying to sabotage 
me, and that is what fits the things 
you just told me.” 

The band of stars had narrowed, 
and it finally vanished above us. 
We advanced through what seemed 
a totally black tunnel now, with 
perhaps the tiniest flickering of light 
a great distance ahead of us. 

“Yes,” she said in the darkness 
before me, “you guessed correctly. 
Brand was afraid of you. He 
claimed he had seen your return one 
night in Tir-na Nog’th, to the undo- 
ing of all our plans. I paid him no 
heed at the time, for I was not even 
aware you still lived. It must have 
been then that he set out to find 
you. Whether he divined our 
whereabouts by some arcane means 
or simply saw it in Eric’s mind, I 
do not know. Probably the latter. 
He is occasionally capable of such a 
feat. However he located you, you 
now know the rest.” 

“It was Flora’s presence in that 
place and her strange liaison with 
Eric that first made him suspicious. 
Or so he said. Not that it matters, 
now. What do you propose doing 
with him if we get our hands on 
him?” 

She chuckled. 

“You are wearing your blade,” 
she said. 

“Brand told me, not all that long 
ago, that Bleys is still alive. Is this 
true?” 

“Yes.” 

“Then why am I here, rather 
than Bleys?” 

“Bleys is not attuned to the 

89 




Jewel. You are. You interact with it 
at near distances, and it will attempt 
to preserve your life if you are in 
imminent danger of losing it. The 
risk, therefore, is not as great,” she 
said. Then, moments later, “Don't 
take it for granted, though. A swift 
stroke can still beat its reaction. 
You can die in its presence.” 

The light ahead grew larger, 
brighter, but there were no drafts, 
sounds or smells from that direc- 
tion. Advancing, I thought of the 
layers upon layers of explanations I 
had received since my return, each 
with its own complex of motiva- 
tions, justifications for what had 
happened while I was away, for 
what had happened since, for what 
was happening now. The emotions, 
the plans, the feelings, the objec- 
tives I had seen swirled like flood- 
water through the city of facts I was 
slowly erecting on the grave of my 
other self, and though an act is an 
act, in the best Steinian tradition, 
each wave of interpretation that 
broke upon me shifted the position 
of one or more things I had thought 
safely anchored, and by this brought 
about an alteration of the whole, to 
the extent that all of life seemed 
almost a shifting interplay of 
Shadow about the Amber of some 
never-to-be-attained truth. Still, I 
could not deny that I knew more 
now than I had several years earlier, 
that I was closer to the heart of mat- 
ters than I had been before, that the 
entire action in which I had been 
caught up upon my return seemed 
now to be sweeping toward some 
final resolution. And what did I 
want? A chance to find out what 
was right and a chance to act on it! 
I laughed. Who is ever granted the 



first, let alone the second of these? 
A workable . approximation of truth, 
then. That would be enough. — And 
a chance to swing my blade a few 
times in the right direction: The 
highest compensation I could re- 
ceive from a one o’clock world for 
the changes wrought since noon. I 
laughed again and made sure my 
blade was loose in the sheath. 

“Brand said that Bleys had raised 
another army — ” I began. 

“Later,” she said, “later. There 
is no more time.” 

And she was right. The light had 
grown large, become a circular 
opening. It had approached at a rate 
out of proportion to our advance, as 
though the tunnel itself were con- 
tracting. It seemed to be daylight 
that was rushing in through what I 
chose to regard as the cavemouth. 

“All right,” I said, and moments 
later we reached the opening and 
passed through it. 

I blinked my eyes as we 
emerged. To my left was the sea, 
which seemed to merge with the 
same-colored sky. The golden sun 
which floated/hung above/within it, 
bounced beams of brilliance from 
all directions. Behind me, now, 
there was nothing but rock. Our 
passage to this place had vanished 
without a sign. Not too far below 
and before me — perhaps a hundred 
feet distant — lay the primal Pattern. 
A figure was negotiating the second 
of its outer arcs, his attention so 
confined by this activity that he had 
apparently not yet noted our pre- 
sence. A flash of red as he took a 
turn: the Jewel, hanging now from 
his neck as it had hung from mine, 
from Eric’s, from Dad’s. The fi- 
gure, of course, was Brand’s.

GALAXY 




I dismouted. I looked up at 
Fiona, small and distraught, and I 
placed Drum’s reins in her hand. 

“Any advice, other than to go 
after him?” I whispered. 

She shook her head. 

Turning then, I drew Grayswan- 
dir and' strode forward. 

“Good luck,” she said softly. 

As I walked toward the Pattern, I 
saw the long chain, leading from 
the cavemouth to the now still form 
of the griffin Wixer. Wixer’s head 
lay on the ground several paces to 
the left of his body. Body and head 
both leaked a normal colored blood 
upon the stone. 

As 1 approached the beginning of 
the Pattern, I did a quick calcula- 
tion. Brand had already taken sev- 
eral turns about the general spiral of 
the design. He was approximately 
two and a half laps into it. If we 
were only separated by one wind- 
ing, I could reach him with my blade 
once I achieved a position parallel- 
ing his own. The going, however, 
got rougher the further one pene- 
trated the design. Consequently, 
Brand was moving at a steadily de- 
creasing pace. So it would be close. 
I did not have to catch him. I just 
had to pick up a lap and a half and 
obtain a position across from him. 

I placed my foot upon the Pattern 
and moved forward, as fast as I was 
able. The blue sparks began about 
my feet as I rushed through the first 
curve against the rising resistance. 
The sparks grew quickly. My hair 
was beginning to rise when I hit the 
First Veil, and the crackling of the 
sparks was quite audible now. I 
pushed on against the pressure of 
the Veil, wondering whether Brand 
had noticed me yet, unable to afford 

THE HAND OF OBERON 



the distraction of a glance in his di- 
rection just then. I met the resis- 
tance with increased force, and sev- 
eral steps later I was through the 
Veil and moving more easily again. 

I looked up. Brand was just 
emerging from the terrible Second 
Veil, blue sparks as high as his 
waist. He was grinning a grin of re- 
solve and triumph as he pulled free 
and took a clear step forward. Then 
he saw me. 

The grin went away and he hesi- 
tated, a point in my favor. You 
never stop on the Pattern if you can 
help it. If you do, it costs a lot of 
extra energy to get moving again. 

“You are too late!'’ he called 
out. 

“I did not answer him. I just 
kept moving. Blue fires fell from 
the Pattern tracery along Grayswan- 
dir’s length. 

“You will not make it through 
the black,” he said. 

I kept going. The dark area was 
just ahead of me now. I was glad 
that it had not occurred over one of 
the more difficult portions of the 
Pattern this time around. Brand 
moved forward and slowly began 
his movement toward the Grand 
Curve. If I could catch him there, it 
would be no contest. He would not 
have the strength or the speed to de- 
fend himself. 

As I approached the damaged 
portion of the Pattern, I recalled the 
means by which Ganelon and I had 
cut the black road on our flight 
from Avalon. I had succeeded in 
breaking the power of the road by 
holding the image of the Pattern in 
my mind as we had gone across. 
Now, of course, I had the Pattern 
itself all around me, and the dis- 



91 




tance was not nearly so great. 
While my first thought had been 
that Brand was simply trying to rat- 
tle me with his threat, it occurred to 
me that the force of the dark place 
might well be much stronger here at 
its source. As I came up to it, 
Grayswandir blazed with a sudden 
intensity which outshone its previ- 
ous light. On an impulse, I touched 
its point to the edge of the black- 
ness, at the place where the Pattern 
ended. 

Grayswandir clove to the black- 
ness and could not be raised above 
it. I continued forward, and my 
blade sliced the area before me, slid- 
ing ahead in what seemed an ap- 
proximation of the original tracery. 
I followed. The sun seemed to dark- 
en as I trod the dark ground. I was 
suddenly conscious of my heartbeat, 
and perspiration formed on my 
brow. A grayish cast fell over every- 
thing. The world seemed to dim, 
the Pattern to fade. It seemed it 
would be easy to step amiss in this 
place, and I was not certain whether 
the result would be the same as a 
misstep within the intact portions of 
the Pattern. I did not want to find 
out. 

I kept my eyes low, following the 
line Grayswandir was inscribing be- 
fore me, the blade’s blue fire now 
the only thing of color left to the 
world. Right foot, left foot . 

Then suddenly I was out of it and 
Grayswandir swung free in my hand 
once again, the fires partly di- 
minished, whether by contrast with 
the reilluminated prospect or for 
some other reason I did not know. 

Looking about, I saw that Brand 
was approaching the Grand Curve. 
As for me, I was working my way 

92 



toward the Second Veil. We would 
both be involved in the strenuous 
efforts these entailed in a few more 
minutes. The Grand Curve is more 
difficult, more prolonged than the 
Second Veil, however. I should be 
free and moving more quickly again 
before he worked his way through 
the barrier. Then I would have to 
cross the damaged area another 
time. He might be free by then, but 
he would be moving more slowly 
than 1 would, for he would be into 
the area where the going becomes 
even more difficult. 

A steady static arose with each 
step that I took, and a tingling sen- 
sation permeated my entire body. 
The sparks rose to mid-thigh as I 
moved. It was like striding through 
a field of electric wheat. My hair 
was at least partly risen by then. I 
could feel its stirring. I glanced 
back once to see Fiona, still 
mounted, unmoving, watching. 

I pressed ahead to the Second 
Veil. 

Angles . Short, sharp turns 
. The force rose and rose 
against me, so that all of my atten- 
tion, all of my strength was now 
occupied in striving against it. 
There came again that familiar 
sense of timelessness, as though this 
was all I had ever done, all that I 
ever would do. And will ... A fo- 
cussing of desire to such an inten- 
sity that everything else was 
excluded . Brand, Fiona, 
Amber, my own identity . The 
sparks rose to even greater heights 
as I struggled, turned, labored, each 
step requiring more effort than the 
previous one. 

I pushed through. Right into the 
black area again. 



GALAXY 




Reflexively, I moved Grayswan- 
dir down and ahead once more. 
Again, the grayness, the mono- 
chrome fog, cut by the blue of my 
blade opening the way before me 
like a surgical incision. 

When I emerged into normal 
light, I sought Brand. He was still 
in the western quadrant. Struggling 
with the Grand Curve, about two- 
thirds of the way through it. If I 
pushed hard, I might be able to 
catch him just as he was coming out 
of it. I threw all of my strength into 
moving as quickly as possible. 

As I made it to the north end of 
the Pattern and into the curve lead- 
ing back, it struck me suddenly 
what I was about to do. 

I was rushing to spill more blood 
upon the Pattern. 

If it came to a simple choice be- 
tween further damage to the Pattern 
and Brand’s destroying it utterly, 
then I knew what I had to do. Yet, 
I felt there had to be another way. 
Yes . 

I slowed my pace just a trifle. It 
was going to be a matter of timing. 
His passage was a lot rougher than 
mine just then, so I had an edge in 
that respect. My entire new strategy 
involved arranging our encounter at 
just the right point. Ironically, at 
that moment, I recalled Brand’s 
concern for his rug. The problem of 
keeping this place clean was a lot 
trickier, though. 

He was nearing the end of the 
Grand Curve, and I paced him 
while calculating the distance to the 
blackness. I had decided to let him 
do his bleeding over the area which 
had already been damaged. The 
only disadvantage I seenied to pos- 
sess was that I would be situated to 



Brand’s right. To minimize the ben- 
efit this would give him when we 
crossed blades, I would have to re- 
main somewhat to the rear. 

Brand struggled and advanced, all 
of his movements in slow motion. I 
struggled too, but not as hard. I 
kept the pace. I wondered as I 
went, about the Jewel, about the af- 
finity we had shared since the at- 
tunement. I could feel its presence, 
there to my left and ahead, even 
though I could not see it now upon 
Brand’s breast. Would it really act 
to save me across that distance 
should Brand gain the upper hand in 
our coming conflict? Feeling its 
presence, I could almost believe 
that it would. It had tom me from 
one assailant and found, somehow, 
within my mind, a traditional place 
of safety — my own bed — and had 
transported me there. Feeling it 
now, almost seeing the way before 
Brand through it, I felt some assur- 
ance that it would attempt to func- 
tion on my behalf once again. Re- 
calling Fiona’s words, however, I 
was determined not to rely on it. 
Still, I considered its other func- 
tions, speculated upon my ability to 
operate it without contact . 

Brand had almost completed the 
Grand Curve. I reached out from 
some level of my being and made 
contact with the Jewel. Laying my 
will upon it, I called for a storm of 
the red tornado variety which had 
destroyed lago. I did not know 
whether I could control that particu- 
lar phenomenon in this particular 
place, but I called for it neverthe- 
less and directed it toward Brand. 
Nothing happened immediately, 
though I felt the Jewel functioning 
to achieve something. Brand came 



THE HAND OF OBERON 



93 




to the end, offered a final exertion 
and passed from the Grand Curve. 

I was right there behind him. 

He knew it, too — somehow. His 
blade was out the instant the pres- 
sure was off, he gained a couple 
feet faster than I thought he could, 
got his left foot ahead of him, 
turned his body and met my gaze 
over the lines of our blades. 

“Damned if you didn’t make it,” 
he said, touching the tip of my blade 
with his own. “You would never 
have gotten here this soon if it we- 
ren’t for the bitch on the horse, 
though.” 

“Nice way to talk about your sis- 
ter,” I said, feinting and watching 
him move to parry. 

We were hampered, in that 
neither of us could lunge without 
departing the Pattern. I was further 
hampered in not wanting to make 
him bleed, yet. I faked a stop thrust 
and he drew back, sliding his left 
foot along the design to his rear. He 
withdrew his right then, stamped it 
and tried a head cut without pre- 
liminaries. Damn it! I parried and 
then riposted by pure reflex. I did 
not want to catch him with the chest 
cut I had thrown back at him, but 
the tip of Grayswandir traced an arc 
beneath his sternum. I heard a 
humming in the air above us. I 
could not, afford to take my eyes off 
Brand, though. He glanced down- 
ward and backed some more. Good. 
A red line now decorated his 
shirtfront where my cut had taken 
him. So far, the material seemed to 
be absorbing it. I stamped, feinted, 
thrust, parried, stop thrust, bound 
and unbound — everything I could 
think of to keep him retreating. I 
had the psychological edge on him 

94 



in that I had the greater reach and 
we both knew I could do more 
things with it, more quickly. Brand 
was nearing the dark area. Just a 
few more paces ... 

I heard a sound like a single bell 
chime, followed by a great roaring. 
A shadow suddenly fell upon us, as 
though a cloud had just occluded 
the sun. 

Brand glanced up. I think 1 could 
have gotten him Just then, but he 
was still a couple feet too far from 
the target area. 

He recovered immediately and 
glared at me. 

“Damn you, Corwin! That’s 
yours, isn’t it?” he cried, and then 
he attacked, discarding what caution 
he still possessed. 

Unfortunately, I was in a bad 
position, as I had been edging up 
on him, preparing to press him the 
rest of the way back. 1 was exposed 
and slightly off-balance. Even as 1 
parried, I realized it would not be 
sufficient, and I twisted and fell 
back. 

I struggled to keep my feet in 
place as I went down. I caught my- 
self with my right elbow and my 
left hand. I cursed, as the pain was 
too much and my elbow slid to the 
side, dropping me to my right 
shoulder. 

But Brand’s thrust had gone by 
me, and within blue haloes my feet 
still touched the line. I was, out of 
Brand’s reach for a death-thrust, 
though he could still hamstring me. 

I raised my right arm, still clutch- 
ing Grayswandir, before me. I 
began to sit up. As I did, I saw that 
the red formation, yellow about the 
edges, was now spinning directly 
above Brand, crackling with sparks 

GALAXY 




and small lightnings, its roar now 
changed to a wailing. 

Brand took hold of his blade by 
the forte and raised it above his 
shoulder like a spear, pointed in my 
direction. 

I knew that I could not parry it, 
that I could not dodge it. 

With my mind, I reached out to 
the Jewel and up to the formation in 
the sky ... 

There came a bright flash as a 
small finger of lightning reached 
down and touched his blade . 

The weapon fell from his hand 
and his hand flew to his mouth. 
With his left hand, he clutched at 
the jewel of Judgment, as if he 
realized what I was doing and 
sought to nullify it by covering the 
stone. Sucking his fingers, he 
looked upward, all of the anger 
draining from his face to be re- 
placed by a look of fear verging on 
terror. The cone was beginning to 
descend. 

Turning then, he stepped onto the 
blackened area, faced south, raised 
both his arms and cried out some- 
thing I could not hear above the 
wailing. 

The cone fell toward him, but he 
seemed to grow two-dimensional as 
it approached. His outline wavered. 
He began to shrink — but it did not 
seem a function of actual size, so 
much as an effect of distancing. He 
dwindled, dwindled, was gone, a 
bare instant before the cone licked 
across the area he had occupied. 

With him went the Jewel, so that 
I was left with no way of control- 
ling the thing above me. -I did not 
know whether it was better to main- 
tain a low profile or to resume a 
normal stance on the Pattern. I de- 



cided on the latter, because the 
whirlwind seemed to go for things 
which broke the normal sequence. I 
got back into a sitting position and 
edged over to the line. Then I 
leaned forward into a crouch, by 
which time the cone began to rise. 
The wailing retreated down the 
scale as it withdrew. The blue fires 
about my boots had subsided com- 
pletely. I turned and looked to 
Fiona. She motioned me to get up 
and go on. 

So I rose slowly, seeing that the 
vortex above me continued to dissi- 
pate as I moved. Advancing upon 
the area where Brand had so re- 
cently stood, I once again used 
Grayswandir to guide me through. 
The twisted remains of Brand’s 
blade lay near the far edge of the 
dim place. 

I wished there were some easy 
way out of the Pattern. It seemed 
pointless to complete it now. But 
there is no turning back once you 
have set foot upon it, and I was ex- 
tremely leary of trying the dark 
route out. So I headed on toward 
the Grand Curve. To what place, 1 
wondered, had Brand taken him- 
self? If I knew, I could command 
the Pattern to send me after him, 
once I reached the center. Perhaps 
Fiona had an idea. Still, he would 
probably head for a place where he 
had allies. It would be senseless to 
pursue him alone. 

At least I had stopped the at- 
tunement, I consoled myself. 

Then I entered the Grand Curve. 
The sparks shot up about me.

As I WRITE THIS there is confusion 
about just what happened in the 
Soviet Union last summer and fall. 
According to one report the Soviets 
have developed a powerful laser 
system capable of blinding our 
infra-red detection satellites; accord- 
ing to another there was a large gas 
fire in Siberia and everyone got ex- 
cited over nothing. 

No matter. Whatever happened in 
1975 there is no secret that the 
United States and the USSR are en- 
gaged in a technological race to de- 
velop large laser weapons. The 
death rays of 1930’s science fiction 
are coming, and someone 'will de- 
velop them. Let’s take the opportun- 



ity to look at lasers, grasers, nasers, 
masers, and such other devices. 

First, all these gadgets have one 
thing in common. They produce 
coherent radiation through stimu- 
lated emission. That sounds ele- 
mentary to about half my readers, 
and incomprehensible to the rest, so 
at the risk of boring some of you 
(we know of at least one Nobel 
prizewinner who regularly reads 
Galaxy) I’d better explain. 

Imagine a mob leaving a football 
stadium after a game. You could 
say that the stadium is radiating 
people. They walk at different 
speeds with different lengths of 
stride, and they go in different di- 



96 



GALAXY 





rections. Their motion is outward 
from the stadium, but otherwise un- 
predictable: it is incoherent. 

Now imagine that they all issue 
from the same stadium door; they 
march in step, each stride the same 
length, and they all go in the same 
direction. Coherent radiation is like 
that. It’s all the same frequency 
(and thus if it is visible light is a 
very pure color); it goes in the same 
direction. Think of light as waves, 
and all the waves have their peaks 
and valleys at exactly the same 
time. The result is a very powerful 
beam. 

This is done by stimulated emis- 
sion, and that takes a bit of explain- 
ing. All electromagnetic radiation 
involves photons. A very small part 
of the electromagnetic spectrum is 
visible light. When the frequency 
gets too high, the light is no longer 
visible, and we call it ultra-violet. 
Higher frequencies yet are x-rays, 
gamma rays, and finally what are 
called cosmic rays. 

Below the red end of the spec- 
trum is, not surprisingly, infra-red, 
which we can detect as heat. At 
lower frequencies still are radio, 
radar, and television. In theory at 
least a “laser” could be built which 
operated in any frequency from 
cosmic rays down through gamma 
rays (grasers) through visible light 
(lasers), down into the infra-red 
(IR), through the radio frequencies 
(masers), and finally down to the 
frequencies we use to send power 
through wires. However, since a 



60-cycle wave (which sometimes 
you hear as a hum if you put a 
cheap radio set near an electrical 
wire) has a wave-length something 
like 3200 miles long, it’s unlikely 
that anyone will ever want to build 
a device to stimulate radiation at 
that frequency. 

In practice we don’t know how to 
build stimulated emission devices at 
all frequencies. One of the Navy’s 
big problems is developing a power- 
ful blue-green laser. Obviously such 
a device would be useful, because 
that’s the frequency of light that 
best penetrates ocean water, and 
would let submarines look a long 
way ahead without giving off the 
characteristic “ping” of a sonar. 
There are, however, lasers at a 
number of visible light frequencies, 
masers which work the same way 
but in radio frequencies, and IR las- 
ers which operate at the low edge of 
visibility. 

They work this way: Take some 
atoms that have the desired charac- 
teristics. Excite an electron, so that 
it jumps to a higher energy state. It 
absorbs a photon when it does that. 
Now “stimulate” the atom so that 
the electron will jump back to the 
lower energy state, giving up the 
captured photon as it does. That 
photon comes out at precisely the 
same frequency each time. Now get 
a lot of those atoms to do that at the 
same time, confine the photons so 
they can’t get out except when 
going in exactly one direction, and 
you’ve got a coherent beam. Its fre- 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



97 




quency will depend on the kind of 
atoms you’ve excited. 

Note what we’ve done. We 
haven’t created any energy. Instead, 
we’ve put in energy and got it out 
again. Since no process is 100% ef- 
ficient, we’ve lost some of our in- 
put. On the other hand, the energy 
we put in wasn’t coherent, and the 
output was. 

The energy input process is called 
“pumping”. The first lasers, and 
many of those for sale commer- 
cially, are pumped by light. There 
are, however, a number of other 
ways to pump a laser. You can use 
electro-magnetic energy by sur- 
rounding the laser device with coils 
of wire and putting juice through 
them. You can also pump the laser 
directly through nuclear radiation, 
and we’ll come back to that. If you 
want a portable laser, you might 
also come up with a mirror system 
that gathers sunlight, focusses it 
into your device, and converts it to 
laser energy. That’s not too useful 
for military weapons unless by 
agreement you won’t fight in the 
shade, but it could be a valuable 
technique. 

However you pump the laser, and 
whatever the frequency you’re us- 
ing, the result is a beam each of 
whose elements is exactly (well, 
almost exactly) parallel. One space- 
tracking system sends out a beam 
that hasn’t fanned to more than a 
few meters at satellite altitudes. 
Thus you’ve concentrated a lot of 
energy into a very narrow beam. 



and that is why all the military 
interest. 

Of course there are a number of 
other applications that have nothing 
to do with war and destruction. 
Laser beams bouncing off the re- 
flector Neil Armstrong left at Tran- 
quility measure the Earth-Moon dis- 
tance within fractions of a centime- 
ter, and that allows tests of great 
importance to cosmologists — one 
cosmological theory says that the 
universal constant of gravitation (G) 
isn’t constant at all, but changes 
with time. Since the masses of Earth 
and Moon don’t change much, a 
good test of whether or not G is 
changing is just how stable that 
Earth-Moon distance is. Incidentally, 
the last I heard the experimental re- 
sults indicate that G is not chang- 
ing, but stay tuned; there’s just 
enough error in the observations to 
let a few cosmologists hang onto 
the G-is-changing theory. Most, 
however, seem to have given it up. 

We’ve all heard about some other 
civilian uses for lasers, such as 
communication, surveying instru- 
ments that need no flag-man and are 
a thousand times more accurate than 
the old transit-target-and-chain sys- 
tem, satellite tracking devices, laser 
surgery to bum out just the cells the 
physician wants killed without 
harming those on either side (and 
yes, lasers can be focussed that 
small), and all the rest. Lasers are 
one major reason for retiring the 
slide rule: laser accuracies allow 
manufacture of the electronic chips 



98 



GALAXY 




that are the heart of pocket comput- 
ers. (It seems unfair, since the 
laser’s inventor was a slide-rule ad- 
dict, but there’s nothing to be done 
about it. Dietzgen has gone out of 
the slide-rule business, and there 
you are. Progress.) 

* * * 

So. We have a source of nar- 
rowly focussed energy. Obviously, 
if we can get enough energy focus- 
sed into a narrow enough beam, we 
have a death ray. Add more and we 
have a disintegrator. The military 
advantages are enormous. No longer 
is there a time-of-flight problem. 
For all practical purposes your shot 
hits the instant it is fired, which 
means you don’t need to track the 
target, whether it’s a tank or an 
ICBM; just locate it, and zap!, it’s 
dead. Also, you’ve launched noth- 
ing, and you can refire your weapon 
as fast as you can pump up its 
atoms. You haven’t contaminated 
your defense environment by blow- 
ing off chemical or atomic weapons 
and thus producing smoke or ioniza- 
tion or something else you can’t see 
through. 

It shouldn’t be any surprise that 
military people sponsor a very great 
deal of laser research. Most of it is 
secret and it takes a lot of digging 
to find out how well they’re doing, 
but from hints that turn up here and 
there, laser weapons are doing quite 
well. A few years ago there were 
rumors that lasers were used to 



knock fist-sized holes in Army 
tanks at about a hundred feet. A 
year ago last fall I was told by a 
usually reliable source that the 
airplane-eating laser was proved out 
to be practical. Now we have the 
rumors of the Soviet laser blinding 
our IR satellites. Even if it didn’t 
happen, it wouldn’t be too surpris- 
ing. 

As I write this there aren’t too 
many details known. According to 
Aviation Week {AW) a publication 
not generally known for being 
wrong, on several occasions the US 
IR-watching satellites were suddenly 
blinded by a very great deal of IR- 
ftequency energy coming into their 
receptors. That could happen in 
several ways. One, there was just a 
lot of IR coming up out of the 
Soviet Union. A very large fire, for 
example, would do it. Another way 
would be for a smaller amount of 
IR to be focussed exactly onto our 
satellite. Nothing could do that but 
a laser. 

Again according to AW, when 
this first happened US weather 
satellites were called on to show us 
the fire in Siberia. They hadn’t seen 
one. USAF also launched one of 
their lower-altitude spy satellites (I 
don’t know what they’re called now- 
adays; they used to be called 
SAMOS, and there was a SAMOS 
project listed in the Pentagon phone 
book, but if you dialled the number 
someone answered “Weather Ob- 
servation’’) and it didn’t find any 
fire. The AW article stirred up a 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



99 




fuss (“panic” was one of the mild- 
er words used to describe reactions 
in the aerospace industry) and there 
was subsequently a Department of 
Defense statement to the effect that 
nothing had happened, and someone 
else reported that it was all a big 
false alarm over a natural gas fire in 
Siberia, and if you take DOD’s 
word for everything they tell 
you — you do, don’t you? — then 
that’s all there is to the story. 

If you have an abnormal distrust 
in DOD flacks, you might react as 
did a USAF general officer friend, 
who pointed out that the early warn- 
ing satellites — they’re supposed to 
watch for the IR flare of Soviet 
rockets, including ICBM’s — are at 
synchronous altitude, and if you can 
shine enough energy on them at that 
altitude you’re a long way toward 
burning holes into something at, 
say, ICBM re-entry altitudes. At 
that point the hackles start rising on 
the back of your neck, or they do 
on mine, and if you’re not scared, 
maybe you’d better rethink the 
problem. 

And here I’ve got to say a few 
words about politics, and I hope I 
don’t lose too much of my reader- 
ship. 

* * * 

In this era of “overkill”, surely 
no one but a madman would risk 
nuclear war. One hears that said 
until it becomes a part of one’s 
mental furniture. Unfortunately, it 
isn’t true. 

100 



One need not be mad to begin 
nuclear war. One may quite ration- 
ally do it. Perhaps “rational” is the 
wrong word. Perhaps I should say 
“logically” instead. It all depends 
on whether or not you regard Marx- 
ism as “rational”. Certainly good 
Marxists do, and in fact every 
Soviet university student is required 
to take some forty semester-hours of 
courses in the subject; and one of 
the tenets of Marxism is not only 
that it is rational, but that it is the 
only rational political philosophy. 

Marxism claims to be an objec- 
tive science of history with predic- 
tive powers. Like Hari Seldon’s 
Plan in the old Asimov Foundation 
series, Marxism doesn’t pretend to 
be exact. Variations are possible, 
and even errors are possible; but 
Marxism is, say the Marxists, the 
only objective science of history, 
and in its broad predictions it is in- 
fallible. Marxism rejects any 
religiously-derived values and ethics 
and goals for the human race; Mar- 
xists have only one source of ethical 
values: to further progress, which is 
defined as moving toward the ulti- 
mate social order, namely the class- 
less society. That which brings us 
nearer that goal is progressive and 
good. That which puts off man’s 
final state is regressive, reactionary, 
and evil. No individual person is 
important, and indeed concern for 
individuals in preference to the ul- 
timate historical goal is mere 
bourgeois sentimentality. 

This most emphatically does not 

GALAXY 




mean that Marxists are villains or 
that they do not love their families 
and friends; only that to allow love 
for friends or families to stand in 
the way of progress is, by defini- 
tion, regressive, reactionary, 
bourgeois, and condemnable. There- 
fore no Marxist could in conscience 
refuse to start World War III so 
long as he could be certain that (1) 
the human race would survive it, 
and (2) the outcome would be the 
world revolution and the triumph of 
socialism. It is as if a convinced 
Christian were truly to believe that 
he could only bring about the Sec- 
ond Coming by starting Armaged- 
don. 

Now naturally no one is going to 
start WW III on a suspicion, a 
rumor, or sloppy calculations. One 
precept of the Leninist branch of 
Marxism (one which I suspect Karl 
Marx would condemn, but I may 
be wrong) is “Do not endanger the 
homeland of Socialism.’* This al- 
lows Marxists to be good Russian 
patriots, and certainly tempers reck- 
less adventurism. However, it is not 
required for all of the Soviet Union 
to survive WW III, so long as 
enough lives through to bring the 
Revolution and its attendent benefits 
to all mankind. What is enough 
might in theory be a scientific ques- 
tion (to Marxists all social problems 
are scientific questions) but in the 
real world any decision is likely to 
be affected by the normal senti- 
ments of mankind, or at least one 
sincerely hopes so. Note, though, 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



that such influence is intellectually 
condemned, and that the more edu- 
cated the Soviet citizen, the more 
intellectual training in Marxism he 
has enjoyed. 

So. Have we demonstrated that it 
would be rational to begin WW IE 
provided only that the military au- 
thorities could assure the Presidium 
that (1) the Soviets would survive, 
and (2) there would be no effective 
opposition to communism through- 
out the world; and that this is en- 
tirely independent of the level of 
casualties the Soviet Union and the 
rest of the world might sustain? 
Now I am not insane enough to 
think that most Soviet citizens, or 
even most Party members, think 
that way; but they are supposed to 
think that way, they teach their uni- 
versity students to think that way, 
and some of them talk as if they re- 
ally think that way; and there is no 
intellectually acceptable argument 
within the confines of Marxism to 
refute the proposition. 

Thus, what happens if one morn- 
ing the Marshal of the Soviet Union 
reports that “If the war begins to- 
morrow, we will lose 40% of our 
population. We will retain at least 
50% of our industry. The Red 
Army will occupy all of Europe to 
the Atlantic coast within 3 weeks. 
The United States, Canada, Au- 
stralia,, and New Zealand will effec- 
tively cease to exist and certainly 
will have no military power what- 
ever. China will be neutralized and 
if it becomes necessary will be re- 



101 




duced to the stone age. What are your 
orders?” 

In my judgment that would not 
be a safe world to live in because 
someone in the Presidium might 
well find it tempting — and would 
the others have effective arguments? 
Be powerful enough to halt the truly 
convinced Marxists? It seems to me 
a bad gamble, and far better for all 
of us that we never give the Sus- 
lov’s of this world such a tempta- 
tion. 

* * * 

Nonsense. Idiocy. Etc. Pournelle 
has finally gone off his rocker, and 
probably was deranged all the time. 
In the first place, no one could im- 
agine keeping national power after 
losing 40% of their population. 

But they took losses of over 30% 
in WW II and emerged infinitely 
more powerful when the war ended 
than when it began. 

Even so. There’s no way to hold 
casualties that low. The US has mil- 
lions and millions of megatons and 
everybody knows that WW III 
would end civilization and indeed 
very nearly exterminate mankind; 
certainly it would end that techolog- 
ical civilization that you, Pournelle, 
are so proud of and from which you 
expect such great things. 

I wish I believed that. Unfortu- 
nately I know better. There is a way 
to fight strategic nuclear war. There 
is a war plan that will neutralize 
most of those US weapons. I’m giv- 



ing away no secrets by describing 
it. 

First, suppose we get rid of the 
airplanes, or at least don’t replace 
the poor old B-52’s which were, 
after all, designed in the post-WW 
era and were built in the 50’s. Sec- 
ond, note that of our missile subs, 
many are in harbor at any given 
time, and can’t get out on less than 
a couple hours’ notice. Scratch half 
the sub force, killed in harbor. 

Next, imagine that the Soviets 
have many more subs than we do 
(and in fact according to Jane’ s 
they do) and that they routinely 
send them out to follow our misslie 
boats around (as, I am told, they 
now do). Scratch more of the sub 
fleet. If we’re lucky maybe ten subs 
will get off their birds. That’s about 
150 missiles; not an impossible 
number to intercept if you’ve got 
laser weapons. We’ll come back to 
that in a moment. 

But there are all those Minuteman 
and Titan missiles. Yes: 1052 in all, 
52 Titan and 1000 Minuteman. All 
land based. All in locations mapped 
precisely down to the last inch. (I 
could obtain such maps with a few 
hundred dollars and a summer of 
work, and if I could we may be 
sure the Soviets have done it.) The 
land-based missiles ean be dealt 
with. 

The technique is ealled pin-down, 
and it works this way. First, blind 
the IR satellites, so that the first in- 
dication that anything is coming out 
of the Soviet Union is from 



102 



GALAXY 




B-Mews at Fairbanks, Gander, 
Thule, etc. If you want to be really 
sneaky fire the first shots from 
submarines. In any event with 
MIRV’s (Multiple Independently- 
targeted Re-entry Vehicles) you 
need only one bird to drop a war- 
head at each Minuteman and Titan 
complex. Explode the warheads at 
optimum burst height. 

Repeat every five minutes. One 
warhead explodes over each mis- 
siles farm. 

I don’t know the exact time of 
powered flight for Minuteman but 
it’s easy to show that it has to be 
more than four minutes, and Titan 
has about the same rise time. The 
birds are very vulnerable during 
boost-phase. It doesn’t take a lot of 
disturbance to knock them way off 
course — after all, a tiny nudge at 
this end is miles and miles after in- 
continental flight. Not one of those 
birds is going to hit its designated 
target. 

Meanwhile, behind that train of 
one-every-four-minutes pindown 
missiles there comes a wave of 
ICBM’s which will finish the job. 

Insanity? Yes, in the sense that 
it’s hard to imagine sane people 
doing it. No, in that it makes per- 
fect sense if you believe the only 
destiny of man is to achieve the 
classless society, and the United 
States is the only obstacle in the 
way of eternal peace and happiness 
for all. 

What evidence have we that any- 
one might do this? Only that when 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



the US decided we had 
“enough” — that is, had achieved 
nuclear sufficiency — we stopped 
building birds. We haven’t put a 
new missile into a silo in a decade. 
It was thought that one reason for 
“international tension” was that the 
Soviets felt strategically inferior to 
us. They were nervous because we 
might be contemplating preventive 
or pre-emptive war. All that would 
vanish when they achieved parity. 
Therefore, we stop building 
strategic weapons and let them 
catch up. 

They caught up. 

They kept going. They’ve got a 
lot more birds than we tlo, and as 
best I can tell, they’re building 
them still. What for? It’s a costly 
effort and of no rational value — 
unless you define rational as I just 
have. 

* * * 

So now what? Should the US 
spend a great deal more money on 
nuclear weapons? Increase our 
over-kill capability? (Note that if 
you assume you’ll lose part of your 
force because you intend to let the 
other guy attack first, you need 
“overkill” in order to have “suffi- 
ciency”. Note also that the Soviets 
have long since gone past us in 
“overkill” capacity, and are still 
pouring concrete and filling silos 
with birds.) 

I won’t pretend to knowledge of 
optimum strategic mix. I’m far out 



103 




of date and intend to stay that 
way — don’t want a clearance. I’d 
rather be able to say what I want 
without worry. It’s certainly possi- 
ble that we need some new strategic 
offense weapons, and to update 
those we have. 

I do, however, have strong feel- 
ings about concentrating entirely on 
offensive weapons. Air Force gen- 
erals have long downgraded 
strategic defense. Air war strategists 
are taught “nobody ever won a war 
by protecting himself’ and similar 
maxims. Defensive weapons are no 
doubt a fine thing, but mostly they 
suck up scarce defense funds that 
should be going into weapons we 
can use to knock out the other guy 
before he can do any harm to our 
people. Given a good enough 
strategic offense, we won’t need de- 
fensive weapons because either we 
will have deterred the other guy so 
he doesn’t start the war in the first 
place, or he will be knocked out 
quickly and effectively if he does. 
So say a number of generals. I have 
never agreed. 

I don’t agree now. I believe a de- 
fensive arms race makes enormous 
sense. Yes, and I supported the 
now-discontinued ABM system, 
too, even though I knew full well 
that Spartan wasn’t likely to be 
worth a hoot in hell. 

Why? 

Well, because the really expen- 
sive technology and the really tricky 
problems of ABM have nothing to 
do with Spartan. Don’t get me 

104 



wrong. The kill mechanism is the 
key problem to effective anti-ICBM 
weapons. Until you have something 
that will deliver lethality you can’t 
shoot down ICBM’s. On the other 
hand, even if you have a marvelous 
kill mechanism, you can’t use it un- 
less you can detect and locate your 
target. 

That was the expensive part of 
our now-defunct ABM system. De- 
tection and tracking. Hardened 
radars. Phased-array radars, which 
look like solid concrete barns, have 
been known in theory for a long 
time, but in practice they’re hide- 
ously complex. They work this 
way. 

In the old-fashioned radar the an- 
tenna moved. A big dish was 
steered mechanically, and your 
tracking computer “knew’’ where 
the dish was pointed at the time it 
received the blip returned from the 
target. The antenna was vulnerable 
to enemy weapons — even chemical 
weapons, sabotage, and small-arms 
fire — and the mechanical parts 
caused terrible errors unacceptable 
at thousand-mile ranges. 

Phased-array radars have 
thousands of small antennae buried 
in a lump of concrete: Nothing 
moves. Instead the various antenna 
elements are excited in a precise 
computer-controlled sequence and 
the returns monitored by computer. 
The whole thing is expensive in 
money, and a few years ago expen- 
sive in terms of needed research to 
get it working. 



GALAXY 




We got that much out of our dead 
ABM. Presumably we have the an- 
tennae and computers, and need 
only a kill mechanism. 

The laser is the obvious answer 
to that. What kind I leave to the 
experts. The theoretically best 
would be x-ray or gamma-ray 
(graser) frequencies since those 
would penetrate atmosphere best 
and deliver the greatest lethality per 
beam cross-section. Missile-killing 
lasers are likely to be large, very 
large, and we need a great deal of 
work on them. 

They may need a new form of 
pumping. We have now a few 
nuclear-energy pumped lasers — that 
is, a small unshielded reactor pours 
neutrons and other high-energy nu- 
clear particles directly into the laser, 
which transforms their energy into 
useful coherent radiation. (It is even 
proposed for the future that 
nuclear-pumped lasers be put into 
orbit to light cities at night and keep 
streets warm in winter. Possible but 
I’d think unlikely.) 

Certainly the efficiency of lasers 
needs work. When you pump 
enough energy in to kill missiles at 
great distances, you’d best not 
waste much in your laser lest you 
melt your own system. Methods of 
steering the mirrors must be de- 
veloped. 

None of this, though, looks all 
that difficult. There was a time 
when really big lasers were 
“theoretically impossible” but them 
days is gone forever. Somebody's 



going to do it. And we will be in a 
new military era. 

There are also enormous civilian 
benefits. Really big lasers can put 
mass into orbit, cutting down on the 
costs of entering the Third Industrial 
Revolution. (See this column in the 
two previous issues of Galaxy for 
more on that.) I do want to em- 
phasize, though, that I’m not argu- 
ing for laser development as ABM 
merely as a sneaky way to get space 
industries. 

No. Big lasers, coupled with al- 
ready developed phased-array radar 
technology, will yield an ABM sys- 
tem capable of handling a few 
hundred incoming missiles. It may 
be chauvinistic of me, but I’d rather 
we had that capability and the 
Soviets didn’t. 

That’s highly unlikely — especially 
so if what our IR satellites saw was 
not a Siberian gas fire — so I’ll settle 
for both of us having the ABM. 
Strategically that would make the 
pin-down attack impossible, and 
any first-strike war plan hideously 
complex. I’ve discussed the proba- 
ble diplomatic consequences in an 
earlier column. The resulting bi- 
polar world has its problems, but 
it’s one we could live in. 

What I really wouldn’t like to see 
is too much temptation put in the 
way of the Party Theoreticians over 
there. Maybe it isn’t likely — 
reverently, I hope to God it isn’t 
likely — but might they believe what 
they’ve been teaching the last forty 
years? ★

It bears moisture from the seas to 
the thirsty land, and in certain sea- 
sons, carries the thoughts of the 
people. /4s the prow of a ship forces 
spray, so the planet's winds, influ- 
enced by the two parent moons, 
drive its inhabitants. It seldom rains 
on Spindrift. 

The day’s sensations were com- 
forting if unfamiliar: The rhythmic 
thrumming of an obelisk tree frag- 
mented with sighs as spindrift 
brushed its crown of fronds. There 
was a purposeful whir of wings 
from a passing dragonfly, skimming 
the puddle of water outside the door 
for food. On the very edge of per- 
ception a human worked his nets, 
the feather-light touch of his aware- 
ness intruding only momentarily 
into the fullness of Galan’s own. 

It had been a good season. The 
tidelands teemed with life, the spin- 
drift was gentle and dependable, 
even the midges were less trou- 
blesome than usual. Beyond the 
stand of trees that fronted the 
house, Galan could see fish Jumping 
on the surface of the salt-pond. The 
giller’s nets would be full this 
night. 



Still, she missed her crystal 
mountain pond, the vivid bloodleaf 
at her door, the warm glint of fire- 
blight and the purity of baby’s breath 
nestled in the tumbled rocks of 
home. Here in the lowlands there 
were no passing ghostweeds, no 
mountain gibby purring on the open 
hearth of a quiet evening, no music 
in the wind. Here there was only 
the dull blue of fen groundsel and 
gray of treewort, and the ever- 
present waterwind. The colors of the 
lowlands muted and ran together in 
a filmy haze, which was good for 
the fish that lived in the salt-ponds, 
and for the beaded lizard eyeing her 
suspiciously from the corner of 
Jamie’s graystone house; good for 
Jamie, who was a giller. But not for 
a musician, whose duty and plea- 
sure lay above the fens and 
marshes, on mountainside where the 
wind was dry and laden with the 
stuff of threnodies and bagatelles. 

She loved Jamie, but she felt no 
sense of shelter in his dwelling, nor 
much sympathy for the hardships of 
his trade. Nor could he, for his 
part, understand her love of the 
heights and the music she found 
there. It was, Galan knew, an im- 
perfect match at best. The week of 
years they had passed in lovemak- 
ing attested to its quality, but it said 
nothing of their other needs. And 
now he had asked her, for the first 
time, to have a child. 

More sensitive than most, Galan 
knew the depth of his need. She 
could receive as well as focus an

emotional response; it was this tal- 
ent that made her what she was, a 
transmitter of music to those whose 
sensitivity was dull and whose feel- 
ings were borne on chaotic winds, 
to be scattered meaninglessly over 
the world. She could channel those 
emotions, play them back to their 
sources organized and strengthened 
into chords of meaning; but it re- 
quired fierce concentration, mainly 
to dampen her own emotions. 

She felt a twinge of resentment 
that he had asked her now, with 
Trine approaching, to decide such a 
difficult question. But she couldn’t 
really blame him, either. Because 
she was more skilled than he in 
controlling emotion, the giller knew 
of her only what she had let him 
know, in carefully phrased re- 
sponses and gently modulated reac- 
tions. He would be appalled to feel 
the true extent of her denial of the 
life he lived, her revulsion at the 
thought of spending the years it 
would take to rear a child here, 
away from her own element. And a 
child did need the polarity of two 
parents; that was the custom and it 
was a good one. She was not pre- 
pared to flout it and knew Jamie to 
be even less so. 

Galan must live here or he must 
come to her, and that he would not 
do. He had his own priorities, after 
all. 

The thought, too heavy to bear, 
came inevitably; Yet I must give him 
an answer. And if it is no, he will 
find another. One who'll be willing 



to share his portion of the world. 
But even more unbearable: Can I 
give up the windsong? Leave the 
highwind to wallow here, in mud 
and salt, for a month of years? 
No .. 

Tired of wrangling with the 
hangman’s choice, she got up and 
went into the house. At the door 
she hesitated, to see that all was in 
order before she left. Her glance 
lingered for a moment on the pallet 
in the corner, seeing more than its 
readiness for his use at day’s end. 
Why should their joining be so 
complete, their pleasure in one 
another so sure, when all else was 
wrong? Oh Jamie, Jamie . 

She shrugged away the sudden 
pang of need, and made herself 
look from the pallet to the rack of 
pipes, the table clear of breakfast 
clutter, the planked floor swept 
clean. Everything would be in order 
when she returned. She would be 
gone, but he would expect that. She 
had already stayed longer than was 
usual, and his proposal would need 
time to consider. 

She placed the protective head- 
piece firmly on her head. Usually, 
she left herself open to sensations 
on the long path home; this time, 
she would pay heed to her own 
emotions, without interference from 
the outside world. Perhaps she 
could weave a solution from their 
tangled skein, one acceptable if not 
beautiful to them both. 

But as she turned mountainward 
her heavy heart belied the hope.

Candace stopped in midpath, feast- 
ing her weary eyes and wearier soul 
on Galan’s dwelling. From her van- 
tage point above the escarpment, on 
the edge of which hung the house, 
she could see the spring-fed pond 
alive with motion even though it lay 
sheltered from the wind. So, she 
elated, even now, seven days before 
Trine, the wind has orchestral 
force. What a fugue it will provide! 

She hoped Galan’s windmantle 
was strongly built so the delicate 
reeds of the windwall would not be 
buffeted meaninglessly. The 
thought, seemingly motile, drew the 
wind at her afresh. Her headpiece 
strained away from her close- 
cropped hair with such force that 
Candace made to save it, even 
though she knew it was fastened se- 
curely under her chin. The coarse 
brown cloth of her cloak twisted 
and flapped about her path-weary 
legs, reminding her once more of 
the hours they had carried her up 
the leeward side of the mountain, 
and of the days before when they 
were cramped in the tiny passenger 
space of a wheeled troika drawn by 
three slavering moorhounds. The 
journey from her own windwall 
atop a smaller peak to the north had 
been a long one. The rest of her 
body, too, was reminding her in 
various ways of the years it had 
served her before bringing her here, 
to journey’s end. 



This will be your last concert 
away from home, old woman, she 
told herself. You’ll not be a lissome 
maid again, not in this life. 

She straightened her sagging 
shoulders and willed her legs to 
move her yet a little farther, and 
woodenly, they complied. She went 
slowly down the rubbled path to- 
ward the rippled shimmer of pond 
and adamantine glow of roof. How 
many men, she wondered as she 
picked her way among the litter of 
stones, had it taken to drag the 
planks for that roof over moor and 
up mountainside? How many to fas- 
ten them there on the edge of noth- 
ingness, securely enough to with- 
stand these many generations of 
windforce. A hundred? Two 
hundred? She couldn’t guess. Even 
to cut the rock-hard wood of an 
obelisk tree took almost superhuman 
strength and will. She had seen the 
process once and never did she 
forget it. Sweat-streaked men with 
hand-axes, hacking first, and then 
hewing with chisels, all to wrest a 
single plank from the sixty-foot 
length of trunk. She had been fasci- 
nated by their patience, their deter- 
mination surely as hard as the 
obelisk itself, and had remarked to 
her companion (a poet whose name 
was Tong forgotten), that it was al- 
most an art-form. 

She did remember his retort: 
“Nonsense. Art is a celebration of 
the natural, not the destruction of it, 
for whatever useful purpose. At best 
this is craft. But art? Hardly!” 



WIND MUSIC 



109 




Candace had not pursued the no- 
tion, for the poet was speaking truth 
as most would see it, but still she 
wondered. She had been taught as 
he had, that the purpose of all art 
was to interpret and illuminate that 
which already existed. Nature was 
the ultimate reality, and discovering 
man’s place in it was the goal of all 
thought and all artistic effort. There 
was no such activity as true crea- 
tion, just as there was no such state 
as perfection. The closest one could 
come to either of these impossibles 
lay in discovery. 

But the thought had always nag- 
ged her: What would it be like to 
create music? Not glean it as we do 
from the wind, nor from the feelings 
borne on its wings, but make it, 
fashion it, ourselves . .from our- 
selves . could it thus generate 
emotion? 

That’s blasphemy, for sure . 
or trumpery. She chuckled aloud. 
But a granddame of advanced 
years is entitled to a bit of irrev- 
erent nonsense now and again. 

“Hoa Candace! Caaandace!” 
The shout came clearly to her, car- 
ried on a strong updraft, then tat- 
tered away on a crosswind. She saw 
the slender figure of Galan round 
pond’s edge and step pathward. 
Now there’s your lissome maid, her 
tired old mind observed. Look how 
she scrabbles up those rocks. 
Energy is indeed wasted on the 
young. She stopped near a patch of 
mouse-ear, the soft furry leaves 
windwhipped and shredded. So let 

110 



the young expend it and save your 
own, old woman. 

Galan covered the remaining dis- 
tance in half the time it would have 
taken Candace, and with gleeful 
huffing and whooshing, threw her- 
self on the older woman. 

“Candace! So long . since 
. your dear presence . whuff!” 
“Slow down, my girl. You 
wouldn’t want to topple an old lady 
from her tired feet, now would 
you?” 

“Old lady, indeed!” Galan 
laughed, then stood back to look 
her up and down. The thin, brown- 
clad shoulders were trapped firmly 
in the young one’s grip. “What’s 
this?” she asked in measured tones. 
“A mourning cloak?” 

Candace nodded slowly. “For 
William, I’m sorry to tell.” 

“And I to hear,” the girl said 
softly. She folded the old woman to 
her, gently, then released her. “But 
come, you’ve been many days 
without a good meal and a soft bed, 
and there’s both waiting below.” 
“Let’s get to it, then,” Candace 
said, “before you have to fetch it 
here.” 

* * * 

Later they sat, the old woman 
and the young one, listening to the 
cheerful sound of the fire. A gibby 
had honored the house with its 
tawny presence and lay purring at 
their feet. On the hearth a jug of 
candlebeny wine was mulling; its 
spicy fragrance filled the room and 



GALAXY 




tantalized their noses. Outside, the 
wind whistled and moaned. 

“And what of Stefan?” Candace 
asked. She was lying on a low pal- 
let near the fire, sated with a supper 
of spoonbread and cheese. 

Galan, seated on the hearth to 
watch over the progress of the 
wine, tossed her head impatiently. 
She did not tolerate Stefan well. 
“Oh, he’ll be here, to be sure. But 
when, the wind knows, not I.” 

“He sent you no message, 
then ... ah, well, he’s young and 
cocksure. But he is a talented mu- 
sician, right enough. Humility will 
come with time. Then even Stefan 
may be surprised at what he can 
do.” 

Galan dipped the wine into 
bowls, handed one to Candace. The 
steaming brew was heady and 
sweet; the old woman sighed her 
pleasure. 

“In Stefan’s case, it may take a 
great deal of time,” Galan observed 
dryly, but without rancor. “Take 
care. It’s hot as a geyser.” 

“And as wonderful,” Candace 
said, sipping despite the warning. 
“It was worth the journey, just for 
this.” 

They drank silently for a while, 
wrapped in comfort and well-being. 
The gibby stirred and opened his 
great green eyes, fixing them both 
with an impassive gaze. 

“What a fine big fellow he is,” 
Candace said. “Will he stay long?” 

“A night or two at best. His 
fancy is even more free than the 

WIND MUSIC 



rest of his breed.” Galan reached 
for him, stroked the white fur under 
his pointed chin. “Is that not so, 
gibcat?” In answer, he yawned 
enormously and flopped his length, 
as great as Galan ’s own, sideways 
to give her more area. 

Candace chuckled. “He’s mind- 
ful of his pleasure, too, I see. Not 
too independent for all that, are 
you, gibby?” 

“We humans could take a lesson 
from him,” Galan said. “You’ll 
never see a gibcat who’ll let himself 
be tethered in exchange for a little 
stroking now and then, for all he 
likes his pleasure.” 

“I read once, I forget where, that 
a gibcat’ s name comes from the 
oldest times; it means ‘one that’s 
castrated,’ from an attempt by our 
ancestors to domesticate him.” 
Galan looked properly horrified. 
“Castrate such a one as this! But 
surely they could see it would do no 
good, either to the beast or the one 
who’d own it.” 

“It may be our ancestors were 
lackwits,” the old woman said. 
“Though they probably thought 
themselves wise enough.” 

The girl sat in silence for a time, 
considering this barbarism. Her face 
was bathed in firelight, giving her a 
mellowness beyond her years. 

Candace caught herself blinking 
and made an effort to be wakeful. 
The combination of food and wine 
and fire was having its effect. Her 
body yearned for sleep, but there 
was much Galan needed to share, 

111 




that was clear. Candace had been 
aware of the younger woman’s tur- 
moil even before she removed the 
protective headpiece to allow the 
full communication their mutual af- 
fection demanded. Speech was suf- 
ficient for business with strangers, 
but hardly adequate for the heart’s 
more pressing needs. 

“So,” the old woman said at 
length, “I think I’m not the only 
one here wrapped in widow’s 
weeds. Would you share your grief? 
Perhaps it will help me to forget my 
own?” 

Galan fixed her eyes on the gib- 
cat and neither her chin nor the 
hand that stroked the fur trembled 
in the least. But she was ripe for 
weeping; Candace could feel the 
tears form in her own thoughts, as 
poignantly as if they were her own. 
She felt a great surge of sorrow for 
the stricken girl, whose loneliness 
was terrible. Maybe more terrible 
than my own, Candace thought. 
Here is the loneliness of choice. 
While mine . death gives us no 
choices. Could I bear my loneliness, 
if William were still within my reach? 

‘‘Speak of it, why don’t you,” 
she invited. “Your heart may not 
be less sore for the telling, but at 
least it will be open. Grief should 
not be hoarded. There’s plenty 
enough of it to share.” 

Speak Galan did, for past her in- 
tention, for she knew the older 
woman was tired. Yet once un- 
locked the emotion poured out of it- 
self; she could not have stopped it 

112 



any more than she could keep the 
waters of the pond from flooding 
the house if the penstock were to 
give way. In simple phrases and a 
complex miasma of emotions the 
story of the giller and his simple 
human request came forth; her de- 
nial of him, and the heartrending 
knowledge that he would seek ful- 
fillment elsewhere; her bitterness 
that she’d been called upon to 
choose between her life and her 
love; her certainty that she would 
never find the latter as satisfying 
with another, nor the former as re- 
warding as it had been in the past. 

The old woman listened and felt, 
giving what comfort there was and 
saying little. The gibcat purred and 
the fire died. Near dawn they slept.

Stefan arrived in five days’ time, 
only two days before Trine. He was 
nervous and impatient, for which 
Galan and Candace made allow- 
ances. This was his first major effort as 
a musician, for Trine coincided with 
perigee only once in seven years. 
Faeder and Modor, the two big 
moons, and Kind, the tiny moonlet, 
exerted their fuir force upon the 
winds and tides on such occasion, 
with the winds rising to gale force 
and the emotional tenor of the 
people at its peak. It was said that 
the winds were responsible for the 
ability to transmit feeling and 
thought. That before coming to 
Spindrift, people had to rely solely 
on words. 



GALAXY 




Deeper thinkers ascribed the ef- 
fect not to the winds, but to the 
moons themselves, saying that the 
orbs were possessed of some mystic 
power, and that when all three were 
in the sky their power was com- 
bined and somehow amplified. 
Deeper thinkers yet believed that the 
power was not mystic at all, but 
merely some unknown physical 
force emanating from the orbiting 
bodies, but they did not speculate 
thus openly. 

Whatever the cause — winds, 
moons ... or something inherent in 
the people themselves invocable 
only by belief in some outer 
agency — when the three moons rode 
the heavens together, the effect was 
of full communal telepathy. The 
normal ability to transmit only 
deepest emotions became Total 
Awareness. 

By formalizing it, madness had 
been averted in the early days of 
Spindrift’s settlement. Through art, 
the thoughts focused on humankind 
rather than one’s own petty con- 
cerns. Trine was traditionally a time 
of catharsis through the celebration 
of the universal; a time when the 
people of Spindrift knew each other 
with an intimacy that would have 
been, they thought, too painful if 
not for the ritual associated with its 
observation. For an event of such 
magnitude a single musician was 
inadequate. Candace, Galan and 
Stefan would perform together, a 
Triple Fugue, with the people de- 
termining the motif. 



They would begin to arrive dur- 
ing the daylight hours, camping at 
every level up the mountain, with 
the earliest enjoying the highest and 
best positions. At dusk, when the 
largest of the moons glimmered 
wanly forth, the musicians would 
prepare themselves to receive; only 
when Modormoon, next in size, 
showed her penumbral shadow, 
would the windmantle be raised and 
the concert begin. On the mountain 
itself the moonflowers which 
bloomed only during the full of the 
parent moons would burst trium- 
phantly open, their pungent fra- 
grance carried aloft on the highwind 
along with their seed. 

The next day the people would 
leave as quietly as they had come, 
but behind them would remain the 
offerings they had brought in pay- 
ment for their experience; moor 
hens and mountainberries, pepper- 
corns and truffles, lengths of midge 
net and blocks of dried peat, sacks 
of millet and rootcrop, and here and 
there a moss agate or geyserite, 
polished to glowing perfection. 

It was a truly unique event, and 
therefore Galan and Candace were 
inclined to be forebearing when Ste- 
fan demanded to know if they were 
ready to do their parts. It was not 
until he insisted upon inspecting the 
reeds, to see for himself that the 
windways were in proper alignment 
and repair, that Galan lost control 
of her temper. 

“And do you think, Stefan,’’ she 
demanded, “that I would misknow 



WIND MUSIC 



113 




my own wall? It’s a perfect instru- 
ment, Trine or no, but if your 
nerves demand proof, inspect all 
you like!” 

‘‘My dear Galan,” said the boy 
(for he was hardly more than that, 
Galan reminded herself forcefully), 
‘‘I am aware that you have but re- 
cently come through a windstorm of 
your own making, but I trust it 
won’t affect your performance as it 
is now affecting your temper 
... the people deserve better than 
that.” 

‘‘I’ll guard my emotions, Stefan, 
and leave you to yours. Just mind 
you don’t overstep your bounds. 
Remember you are, for all your tal- 
ent, but a beginner.” 

Their anger vibrated the air. Can- 
dace, having lived through many 
perigees and not a few Trines, 
sought to restore calm. ‘‘Come, 
come,” she pleaded. ‘‘The three of 
us will be together when the wind 
roars through that wall. It will be 
difficult enough for each of us to 
stanch the inner flow of feelings, 
the better to feel the larger flow 
from without; this turmoil amongst 
ourselves won’t be of any help in 
the task.” 

Galan’s anger abated in the face 
of the old woman’s appeal. But Ste- 
fan still radiated resentment. His 
heart burns with jealousy, the old 
woman observed, for what he feels 
Galan has that he is more deserving 
of Compared to the mountain be- 
neath our feet, Stefan’s is little bet- 
ter than a hillock. 



Tossing his fair straight hair, the 
boy determined to have the last 
word: ‘‘I am glad that one of us is 
heart-free and hopeful of the fu- 
ture,” he flung at them. ‘‘If I’m 
any reader of the winds at all, the 
mood this year is joyous and thank- 
ful of nature’s bounty. The two of 
you’d be better suited to feed them 
back a dirge, as if they’d been in- 
flicted with pestilence and 
drought.” 

Now it was Candace who flared. 
Young scalawag. Tell me how to 
practice my art, will he? Yet her 
voice when she spoke betrayed no 
emotion, and she forced the inner 
calm to dampen its presence in her 
thoughts. ‘‘You speak thought- 
lessly, my young friend. Be as- 
sured that Galan and I will be as 
ready as your unpracticed self 
when the great event arrives. And as 
for the interpretation, it would be 
more professional if you’d await the 
presence of those people you be- 
spoke, before you try to judge their 
thought.” Her face wrinkled in 
mischief. ‘‘Besides, it may be that 
the people need what Galan and I 
have to share with them more than 
they need a smug reflection of 
themselves. Who’s to say? Surely 
not a young musician making ready 
for his first Trine.” 

He was staring at her, aghast. 
‘‘You would attempt to ... to in- 
fluence the music? You joke badly 
with me, Candace. I nevet did take 
you for a mossback, but neither did 
I think you a heretic. Moonstruck,

the both of you. I’m going to the 
peak for solitude, to see if I can 
mend the hole you’ve made in my 
objectivity. I only hope your two 
minds are as suitably composed 
when I return as my unpracticed 
one!” 

With that, he stomped from the 
house. 

Candace and Galan exchanged 
glances, and when he was out of 
earshot, burst into peals of laughter. 

‘‘That pompous, insensi- 
tive ...” Galan began, and Can- 
dace finished the thought, 
‘‘. rockwortl" They tumbled to 
the hearthside pallets, gasping and 
holding their sides. A harlequin ta- 
ble, knocked to the floor when 
Galan missed her aim, spilled its 
contents, but in their mirth they 
didn’t notice. 

”... Remember now, see that 
your mind is . .” 

“Suitably composed. Quite so!” 
“Moonstruck, are we?” Candace 
said when their laughter had sub- 
sided. “A mooncalf himself, and 
telling me I’m struck!” 

“Ah, well, as you said before, 
he’s young. If we were not tolerant 
of youthful offense, there’d be few 
adults in the world.” 

“Truly spoken, Galan. You wear 
your own maturity well.” 

The girl sobered and threw a dis- 
comfited glance at her companion. 
“If only it were so. Stefan’s right 
to this extent: my objectivity is 
strained at best.” 

“I have a premonition suitable 



for Trine,” said the old woman. 
“The answer you seek will come in 
the fugue. Objective or no, it will 
be worthy of the people’s considera- 
tion, too.” 

The girl lifted a quizzical brow. 
What scheme is this dear old lady 
hatching? Aloud, she inquired: 
“And Stefan? Will such as he ap- 
preciate this answer?” 

“Perhaps not now,” Candace 
acknowledged. “But even Stefan 
will someday feel the pain of per- 
sonal loss.” 

★ * * 

Faedermoon’s pale disc had al- 
ready become visible when the last 
to arrive settled into the protection 
of the rocks. A thousand eyes were 
fastened upon heaven, a thousand 
ears filled with windsong. 

Galan strained in the still- 
sheltered house to feel Jamie’s pre- 
sence on the hillside, though she 
knew it would be lost in the mul- 
titude who awaited Modormoon’s 
appearance. Perhaps then, she 
thought, when the windmantle’ s 
raised, there’ll be some small indi- 
cation of his presence, borne aloft 
with all the rest, yet separate from 
them . 

Candace interrupted the thought 
with a gentle admonition. “It’s 
time, Galan. Modormoon is show- 
ing herself.” 

Breathing deeply, Galan willed 
herself to be empty of the giller, to 
be drained of all personal considera- 
tions and attend to the needs of 



WIND MUSIC 



115 




those gathered without. Then she 
walked to the truss on the right, as 
Stefan went to the left, and together 
they levered the mantle away from 
the wall. 

The exposed reeds began to vi- 
brate, slowly at first, and then in a 
crescendo as the mantle was raised 
to its fullest height and the moon- 
pulled air roared through the wind- 
ways. Cacophonous at the start, it 
was gathered slowly into tones as 
Stefan’s mind took hold, simulta- 
neously modulating the vibration of 
the reeds, and stating the question 
that poured upward from the 
gathered minds. His control was 
firm and sure, the question that 
would form the basic motif for the 
first movement o6 the future 
strongly put. Galan had no diffi- 
culty adding the counterpoint of 
doubt that this was the most impor- 
tant question man in his ignorance 
could pose. She could feel Candace 
reinforcing her, strengthening the 
counterpoint against the steady 
throb of Stefan’s opening: Why, the 
gathered minds demanded, as one, 
must there be hardship, suffering, 
want in the midst of plenty? Why 
death? 

And the counterpoint? What good 
to ask? Death is surely as natural 
as life. Is there not some other 
question that lies deeper in the 
heart? 

Candace strengthened her control, 
forcing the counterpoint to become 
the main theme. Stefan receded into 
background. Why is acceptance so 

116 



difficult? Candace phrased it as a 
sigh, adding: If we are born of the 
soil, why do we hate its call? 

Galan joined her, a series of im- 
ages: Does the moorhound question 
his yoke? Can a fish hate the net? 
Only man rails at fate. 

Stefan left off his repetition of 
the earlier chords, made the re- 
sponse borne upward from the 
gathered multitude: And only man is 
vain. Our death feeds the soil, and 
it replenishes us. 

So, Galan thought, Stefan had 
been right. The fugue would be a 
celebration of death, an almost joy- 
ful affirmation of its place in na- 
ture’s scheme. The doubts, the grief 
at the personal loss it caused, the 
anguish at its contemplation, all 
would sink into background, to be- 
come mere counterpoints to the 
main theme: Death may triumph, 
but we, the living, reap its benefits. 

Stefan continued, the reeds parted 
firmly to provide forceful accom- 
paniment to the image: We see the 
parent moons, how they move apart 
to make way for Kind. We must 
take our lesson from them, and go 
readily to the soil, that our children 
will prosper. 

Galan prepared to counter softly. 
And the childless? Should they think 
so highly of the moons’ example? 
She had barely chorded the phrase 
when Candace startled them all by 
introducing a stop. Overriding both 
of the younger musicians, she fol- 
lowed the brief rest with a strongly 
phrased command: Consider one 



GALAXY 




such ill-fated soul, whose mate has 
gone to the soil, leaving no child 
behind to comfort a grieving 
mother. Can such a one be recon- 
ciled so easily? What of loss? Not 
of life, but of a loved one? 

Come, feel for a heartbeat her 
grief at his passing . 

Stefan was struck dumb. He was 
staring at the older woman in- 
credulously, the wall totally out of 
his control now as the fine, sure 
touch of Candace manipulated it. 
After a moment’s hesitation, Galan 
joined her. And finally, many 
heartbeats later, Stefan too joined 
in, providing a counterpoint of 
youthful optimism for their mutual 
and most incredibly personal la- 
ment. 

More sure now that Stefan had 
succumbed to Candace’s innovation, 
Galan moved to take control: What 
of the unhappy lover? Come, feel 
the pain of separation . 

She had just chorded the phrase 
when a thought touched hers, tenta- 
tively at first, but so familiar to her 
that it grew quickly into his pre- 
sence. Jamie! He had come after 
all. 

With his presence so strong as to 
be standing beside her, the last 
shreds of objectivity were cast 
aside, and she began to tell him, in 
the music, of the feelings she’d kept 
hid. The other two musicians gave 
up the reeds, letting her mind range 
at will over the instrument set into 
the wall. They listened with the 
rest, as Galan bared her heart. But 



they might all have left save one, 
and the music would have been the 
same. 

Together, the three finished the 
last movement. It would be, Galan 
knew, the subject of many a debate 
among those gathered below, but it 
would also be not soon forgotten; 
for at its end, the wind carried an 
ovation of tears. 

* * * 

“You’ll go then?’’ Candace 
asked. She stood by the pond, ready 
to leave. 

“I’ll go,’’ Galan answered. 
“Perhaps we’ll invent a new cus- 
tom, Jamie and I. A child raised a 
season in the father’s element and a 
season in the mother’s may be a 
most fortunate being. Who can 
know till it’s tried?’’ 

The old woman nodded. “I doubt 
that it matters much where a child 
is loved, only that it is loved. And 
as to custom, it’s a good thing to 
flout now and again. Keeps the 
world young, and vital.’’ She 
winked so wickedly that Galan had 
to laugh, and almost missed her 
question: “Has Stefan recovered?’’ 
“Magnificently,’’ G^lan said. 
“His ego is already devising appli- 
cations for the future.’’ 

“Ah, well. I’ll leave it to you 
younger souls to see that he controls 
it. One’s particular concerns should 
not be elevated to the level of art 
unless they are of truly universal 
interest. The traditional approach 



WIND MUSIC 



117 





may be right to that extent. But 
neither should art become an insipid 
reflection of the majority.” She 
cocked her head, an old elf who 
knew the mischief she’d done. 
“When I made my personal sorrow 
a part of the future, did you know 
that you would do likewise? Or was 
it only impulse?” 

“That,” Galan said, “plus the 
presence of Jamie in my thought. 
Trine brought many novelties this 
year, eh, Candace?” 

The old woman nodded. “And 
your giller? Do you know his mind 
as well as your own? Will he give 
up his lowlands each season as it 
turns, for all the time it will take to 
raise a child?” 

“After hearing the music we put 
into the wind, how could he re- 
fuse?” 

They embraced and Candace took 
her leave. 

It may be her last concert, Galan 
thought as she watched the solitary 
figure dwindle out of sight, but it 
won't be an end to her. She’s 
brought a new kind of music to the 
world. No longer will an artist be 
content to read the message carried 
on the wind, when he can create his 
own, and make the wind carry it. 

Joyously she considered a name 
for the child. Candace if it’s a girl. 
If a boy, we’ll call him Candor. A 
novel name perhaps, but the 
world’ll learn to like it. 

Then she went inside to make 
ready for her own journey, to the 
lowlands where the giller waited. ★

1 HE TROUBLE WITH AN IN- 
JOKE,” B.D. Wyatt once told me, 
“is that, to work, it must be super- 
fluous.” 

Ever hear of Rocket To The Mor- 
gue! It’s a murder mystery the late 
Anthony Boucher published many 
moons ago (a reissue of which 
would be timely and a review copy 
of which would be appreciated), 
which takes place in the world of 
SF, and whose characters, I am 
told, are drawn from Heinlein and 
John Campbell and like that. I 
would love to read this book. I am 
informed that it is a fine, tight mys- 
tery as good as Boucher ever pro-

duced (a considerable recommenda- 
tion), with the added spice of the 
in-joke. 

I did read, and thoroughly en- 
joyed (and would welcome a reissue 
etc.) Larry Niven and David Ger- 
rold’s The Flying Sorcerer, which 
was a carefully plotted and splendidly 
written novel of interstellar hilarity, 
one of the most consistently hilari- 
ous books I’ve ever read. It also 
took added spice from an in-joke: 
its alien primitives worship a pun- 
theon of gods with SF names 
(Fineline the God of Engineers, 
T’Sturshin the God of Love. Elcin 
the Midget God of Thunder and 
Musk-watz of the Winds being en- 
tirely enough examples). 

Are you getting my point? The 
in-joke is a splendid spice. Try to 
bake a cake of nutmeg sometime. 

Now You See ItIHimIThem ... is 
a nutmeg cake. It, like Rocket to 
the Morgue, is a murder mystery, 
and get this, kids: the murder takes 
place at what the jacket copy al- 
leges is a WorldCon (World Science 
Fiction Convention, Mr. Van 
Winkle) — although it reads more 
like a cross between some ghastly 
little regional Con and a Star Trek 
Sale (I refuse to call them Cons). 
You get brief vicarious glimpses of 
Gordy Dickson, Kelly Freas (mys- 
teriously described as “white- 
haired”) and a few other pro and 
fan luminaries, and the murder itself 
involves Mysterious ESP Powers 
and a Vanishing Killer. The murder 
victim is, named Tucker, but in no 



way resembles the Tucker / have 
come to know and . er, know; 
nor does the sheriff named Hensley 
remind me overmuch of Honest Joe. 
The plot is dumb, the writing tired, 
all characters in the book are moron 
stereotypes — all it has going for it is 
the in-joke, which, since it ain’t 
superfluous, collapses under the 
strain. 

Then . 

On the other hand. 

There’s The Starcrossed, Ben Bo- 
va’s delightful novel of gibbering 
madness in the 3-D TV biz, which 
might have been subtitled Fear and 
Loathing In Toronto. 

For those few of you who won’t 
catch the reference, Harlan Ellison 
once created and sold a TV series, 
The Starlost, which was taken from 
his tender hands, raped, beaten, 
ritually mutilated and left for dead 
on the airwaves. This end-product 
(and the expression may never have 
been more aptly-used) was so unrec-' 
ognizably butchered that Harlan 
rightly insisted the series be ere; 
dited to ‘‘Cordwainer Bird,” a fic- 
titious entity and another in-joke. 
You wanna hear horror stories about 
the scriptwriter who thought the 
back-up controls were what would 
make the starship back up, go talk 
to Harlan — or talk to Ben, who 
worked as “science consultant” 
preproduction until he discovered 
that they were ignoring every word? 
he said. 

Now Ben once got a terrific! 
novelette, “When No Man Pur-* 




sueth,” out of me by having me fic- 
tionalize something that actually 
happened to me on a Greyhound 
bus. So this time he followed his 
own advice and wrote a thinly- 
disguised account of the filming of 
Starlost, set in a near- future which 
represents an all-too-plausible ex- 
trapolation of the decadence of the 
TV industry here and in Canada. It 
is deftly plotted, mordantly satiric, 
actually rib-splitting in places — and 
includes a character who I swear to 
God is Harlan to the life . 

But please note the order: it is a 
good book and it is a lovely in- 
joke. Even if you are one of the 
dwindling minority who don’t know 
Harlan, or one of the lucky few 
who missed The Starlost, you will 
almost undoubtedly enjoy The Star- 
crossed, the Catch-22 of the TV 
world in SF form. In a book-full of 
funny gags, the in-joke is blessedly 
superfluous . and therefore it 
works. 

* * * 

Enough on the subject of in- 
jokes. What else in dis paper bag? 
(I’m “on vacation’’ in the United 
Snakes this month, selling two 
books and a fat novella, battling en- 
tropy under the hood of my car, 
gulping books whenever I can, gen- 
erally between enormous medicinal 
doses of Tullamore Dew.) A series, 
then, of more or less disconnected 
snapshots: Oh yez. Human 

Machines. 



It’s getting to the point where any 
antho with George Zebrowski’s 
name on it goes to the top of my 
reading list (a dizzying height) sight 
unseen. This one confirms the ten- 
dency. It’s not the first theme antho 
on cyborgs, and it won’t be the last, 
but it’s one of the best: a wide- 
spectrum sampling of SF specula- 
tion on cybernetic intelligence over 
the last 25 years, ranging from Guy 
Endore’s “Men of Iron’’ to Jack 
Dann’s “I’m With You In Rock- 
land’’; from Kuttner’s “Camou- 
flage” to Vonnegut’s “Fortitude”; 
and it includes a remarkably in- 
teresting intro (almost a contradic- 
tion in terms) on The Cyborg in SF. 
Also represented are Damon 
Knight, C. L. Moore, Walter Miller 
Jr., “J.J. Coupling,” James Blish, 
editor Zebrowski (a ghastly story 
about a starship fucking itself) and 
co-editor Thomas N. Scortia with 
one of his best stories, “Sea 
Change.” It is worth noting that 
while these stories are individually 
excellent and collectively an exhaus- 
tive exploration of the cyborg con- 
cept, they are none of them the 
overanthologized, overfamiliar 
stories a hack-editor could have 
cheaply and quickly slapped to- 
gether on the theme. C.L. Moore’s 
stupendous “No Woman Born,” 
fifty years ahead of its time when it 
was printed in 1944, is alone worth 
the $2.95 bite. Go get it. 

Okay. I’ve recommended the 
book. Now I can indulge myself in 
an aside. Ninety percent of the cov- 



BOOKSHELF 



121 




ers on SF novels make my gorge 
rise, and I’ve only indulged myself 
once before; but this time I cannot 
be silent. You let Pournelle sound 
off a few months ago, Baen — now 
it’s my turn. 

You want a symbolic cover for a 
book of stories about human 
machines, living hardware, OK? So 
there’s a frontal head shot of a guy 
with the top of his head unplugged, 
suspended by braces a good five or 
six inches above the rest of him, 
OK? Now I don’t know about you, 
but if I am the kind of bookstore- 
browser who judges a book by its 
cover (and the publishers say we all 
do), I am going to be turned off to 
the book when I notice that the top 
half of the skull is designed to join 
with the rest both by a three-prong 
vacuum-tube-type socket and by a 
fixed position screw-band which 
necessitates the rotating of the 
skull-cap. You can’t connect the 
damned thing without destroying 
it — screw the brain into place and 
you snap off two of the three 
prongs. 

Now listen — you can’t hold this 
against Scortia and Zebrowski. No 
one has less control over the cover 
of a book than its creator. Nor can 
the artist take the rap — he failed to 
sign his masterpiece. But someone 
should tell Vintage it’s the little 
things like this that hurt. 

End of indulgent aside.

Next: The Stardust Voyages. 
From the experiences of the last 
week, I can assure you that it shall 
be easier for a camel to pass 
through Murcheson’s Eye than for a 
writer to sell a collection of short 
stories. Apparently an alarming 
number of you klutzes would rather 
read a dumb long story than a series 
of good short ones — or so the pub- 
lishers believe (how do you feel 
about single-author collections? 
Why don’t you drop your favorite 
publishers a line and let him 
know?). So Stephen Tall and I both 
used the same dodge: collect your 
common-background stories, put’em 
together, call them chapters, and 
you’ve got ... a novel! 

Despite the kiss-of-death cover- 
copy (“In the great tradition of 
STAR TREK’’), Tail’s book suc- 
ceeds almost as well as mine — with 
one qualification: you must not 
(nay, can not) read this book in one 
sitting. If you do, the exegesis-of- 
background will by the third “chap- 
ter” become so unneccessarily re- 
dundant and repetitious (according 
to the Bureau of Redundancy 
Bureau) that you’ll put the book 
down. The six Stardust stories were 
written and sold over a period of 
eight years, and for each the entire 
background and cast had to be rees- 
tablished. Unfortunately, this was 
so skillfully done each time that 
background metastasized within the 
body of each story, surgically inop- 
erable (a problem I sidestepped with 
the Callahan’s Place stories by beat- 



122 



GALAXY 




ing my brains out to find ten differ- 
ent ways to explain what Callahan’s 
Place is). 

So read the Voyages one at a 
time. They’re good stuff, especially 
the 1972 Hugo Finalist “The Bear 
With The Knot On His Tail.’’ But 
let a lot of time go by in between. 
Oh yeah — half of them first ran in 
Galaxy. 



I’ve been waiting to read Soldier, 
Ask Not for a long time — I’ve been 
a fan of Gordy Dickson’s Dorsai 
stories for nearly as long as Jerry 
Pournelle. I was able to find Tactics 
of Mistake, and Gordy graciously 
lent me his own only surviving 
copy of Dorra/.' (which Ace had reti- 
tled “The Genetic General’’ — 
yecch), but Soldier eluded me for 
years. 

I tell you, I wish it had continued 
to elude me. 

Soldier, Ask Not has some juicy 
stuff in it. One third of it was pub- 
lished as a novella and won some- 
thing called a Hugo in that cate- 
gory, which says something. It fills 
in a lot of the holes in Dorsai his- 
tory, particularly in the biographies 
of Donal and Kensie Graeme. But it 
just doesn’t work as a novel. Things 
happen — or fail to happen — ^just too 
conveniently; characters behave as 
the plot, rather than their selves, re- 
quires. There is a general air of 
contrivance, the faint sound of plot 
machinery clanking in the

background, and the psychotic pro- 
tagonist’s last-act change of heart 
(“Oh / get it ... I ought to be 
nice.”) just rang false. What has to 
have happened here is a classic case 
of a damned good novella ruined by 
expansion. 

Worthwhile for true Dorsai

From somewhere they keep coming, 
lately, like some inexorable tide of 
sludge: quickies by Mack Reynolds. 
It takes a competent craftsman to 
keep churning them out, and it is 
frustrating to watch a competent 
craftsman wasting his time doing 
so. So far, each has been worse 
than the last, and founded on ever- 
shakier moral principles. This latest. 
Ability Quotient, rests on the as- 
sumption that rule by an elite is na- 
tural and advisable, provided they 
are a genuine elite. Who defines 
elite? Mack Reynolds, and for the 
nth time his “hero” is a man I 
wouldn’t invite home to dinner. Ah, 
but he’s got a high Ability 
Quotient — doubletalk for survival- 
proneness — and Magic Pills that 
turn him up to 78 RPM like Alvin 
the Chipmunk. His name ... are 
you ready? ... is Killer Caine.

Six Science Fiction Plays is one 
of those collections you can’t use 
the Spider Scale to rate: there’s too 
great a disparity in the contents. To 
start with, its title is incorrect. It 
contains three plays, two teleplays 
and a screenplay — a short 

screenplay. As far as I can deter- 
mine from the information supplied, 
only one has ever been produced. 
Do you understand what you are 
buying? Six pieces which failed to 
sell in their own medium — like buy- 
ing sheet music for songs nobody 
wanted to record. 

And yet, there are things in the 
book that make it worth buying. 
The smasher, of course, is the one 
that was produced: Harlan Ellison’s 
Star Trek episode, “The City At 
The Edge of Forever.” Now, this 
isn’t the version that ran on TV and 
won the Hugo and the George 
Melies Fantasy Award. This is Har- 
lan’s uncut original, the one that 
won the Writer’s Guild Award, and 
it is much much better in every 
way, and it is printed here for the 
first time, and it is a rare treat. Har- 
lan’s intro is as long, and as good, 
as they always are. Also pleasant to 
read was Fritz Leiber’s teleplay, 
“The Mechanical Bride.” While a 
little trite in plot, it could, properly 



124 



GALAXY 




produced, be a real chiller. What do 
I know? Maybe Alfie Hitchcock or 
somebody already did it. 

But the balance of the Stage and 
Screen SF is the kind of stuff that 
closes out of town before it opens, 
ancient themes given nothing to 
make them come alive. “Distin- 
guished dramatist” Paul Zindel’s 
“Let Me Hear You Whisper” was a 
particularly sophomoric satire on the 
heartlessness of scientists, and even 
the Real SF Writers (John Jakes, 
the Cogswell Twins, and Tom Rea- 
mey (?) weren’t much better.

really stuck for a play, try this — but

Space relations was disturbingly 
good. How do I go about praising a 
book about interstellar S&M? Well, 
I can tell you that it’s exceptionally 
well-written, tastefully handled, en- 
tirely engrossing, reasonably plausi- 
ble and populated by real people, I 
guess. Voracious aliens called Plith 
are approaching inhabited space, 
and scattered human planets are 
forming a Treaty Organization in 
self defense. Kossar wishes to 
join — but the Organization charter 
forbids slavery, on which Kossar’ s 
economy appears to depend. The 
problem is solved by what has to be 
the ultimate extrapolation of the 
masochist-hero theme — a secret 
agent who engages in an undercover 
mission involving the classic 



mistress-slave relationship with a 
Kossarian noble-woman, only to 
discover that he loves it. 

I liked the book. It was . how 
shall I say it? . disquietingly en- 
joyable. Let’s see more from 
Donald Barr.

Continuing our flirtation with 
aberration, we find . Gahan Wil-

What can I say about a book of 
cartoons? There’s this boat tootling 
out of the Tunnel of Love, and the 
couples in it are all snarling and 
yapping at one another, and one of 
the men in the foreground is 
grumbling, “Get the repair crew 
here on the double!” Or there’s a 
three-headed man answering the 
phone with, “Burns, Burns & 
Burns; this is Burns, Burns and 
Bums speaking.” (these days I an- 
swer my own phone with, “En- 
chanted Delicatessen — this is the 
mustard speaking.”) Or there’s . 

There’s an indeterminate (no page 
numbers) but satisfying number of 
Gahan Wilson cartoons, and that’s 
all that need, or can, be said. Wil- 
son claims to draw what he sees.

Most of you can skip this next one; 
but if you are a researcher, an 
academic, a dedicated critic, or 
someone hard-up for a thesis, the 
Science Fiction Book Review Index, 
1923-1973 will be an invaluable 
find. It is a staggering achievement, 
a literal index of every review 
printed in an SF prozine in the last 
fifty years, plus maintstream and 
fanzine reviews of fantasy and SF 
for the last three years. It is indexed 
by author-of-reviewed-work, in- 
cludes exhaustive directories of ail 
prozines cited (clarifying magazine 
numbering errors), and has an 
editors’ index (Doc Lowndes holds 
the all-time record, having edited 11 
different titles, followed by Hugo 

126 



Gernsback with 8). It is crammed 
full of eminently accessible informa- 
tion for which I have no use 
whatsoever — but if you want or 
need to know, say, what Alfred Be- 
ster had to say about Ted Stur- 
geon’s Venus Plus X, this will at 
least tell you whatever it was, was 
said in Vol. 20 No. 1 (Jan. 1961) 
of Fantasy <6 Science Fiction on 
pages 95-6. Then all you need is a 
complete library of F&SF (and the 
215 other magazines covered in this 
438-page, oversize volume). 

Now me, I’d call up Alfie and 
ask him. 

1 have no idea how much the 
book costs — there’s no price given; 
But if you want it, you probably 
won’t care. It’s apparently available 
only from Gale Research Co., Book 
Tower, Detroit, Michigan 48226. 
Editor H.W. Hall promises to up- 
date it in annual volumes and will 
deal with you privately for them.

Next month I intend to devote 
something on the order of half a 
column to John Brunner, thanks to 
an explosion of fascinating books 
by and about him that arrived too 
late for inclusion this month — but I 
can’t leave without telling you 
about the two I did have time to 
finish. As anyone will tell you, pa- 
perback distribution is the shits: if I 
wait until next month to review 
these two books, so I can tie them 
in with the others, they’ll be gone 



GALAXY 




from your bookstore. So by all 
means go out and purchase copies 
of Bedlam Planet and/or (depending 
on your finances) Polymath, while 
they last. 

Bedlam Planet is vintage 1968 
Brunner, with all the Brunner 
hallmarks. Characters so real they 
tug at your fingers as you turn the 
pages, situations of poignant irony, 
masterful plotting, a seemingly- 
effortless writing style just spattered 
with all those grace notes of insight 
and wit, and the innovative theme 
that the mind may not always be the 
best tool with which to face the un- 
known. It concerns a group of 
shipwrecked colonists, trying to 
adapt to their new home with less 
than half the equipment and 
supplies they need, and the uniden- 
tified native bacteria which prevent 
their bodies from metabolizing as- 
corbic acid; and the unique solution 
they are vouchsafed when a few of 
them become wise enough to go in- 
sane. One of those rare books that 
engages the brain and the heart in 
turns, that is to say, standard Brun- 
ner. 

Polymath also concerns space- 
wrecked humans, who land on a mys- 
tery world after barely escaping the 
destruction of their home planet by 
nova. They ground safely, but their 
ship is subsequently wrecked. Pro- 
ducts of centuries of easy-living, 
urban utopia-style, they nonetheless 
begin working toward continued 
survival on their new home, facing 
fierce predators and a savage 



winter. But it seems a second 
survivor-ship also reached this 
planet, and crashed up in the moun- 
tains . could they not provide 
invaluable aid and, more important, 
moral support? The central character 
is a “polymath,” a multi-discipline 
genius with high-survival potential 
specially trained to help colonists 
survive on a strange world. Only, 
when the home sun blew up, he 
was just beginning the decades of 
training — and what instruction he 
did receive was not for the planet 
they’ve found. John has s^me tren- 
chant observations to make about 
who are the survivor-typ and 
some unique insights about hk\man 
behavior under crisis. A grit >ing 
adventure, with that air- -reality 
that only Poul Anderson can do as 
consistently. Dammit, I care about 
Brunner’s characters — and fortu- 
nately for me, he does too.

^^ILL STEWART STEADIED HIMSELF 
against the bulkhead and peered 
through the small telescope that 
floated in front of the port. Free of 
any motion his muscles might have 
imparted to it, the scope afforded a 
crystal-clear view of the target area. 
He glanced at the monitor to his 
left. It showed the same view, but 
not as sharply. He pushed a lighted 
button beneath the monitor and the 
words MAIN SEQUENCE. 
BEGIN RUN. .24 AUG 93. 
13:46:53— GMT. .MARK. 
Lat 14 42N LONG 17 29 W flashed 
briefly across the screen. 

He returned his gaze to the tele- 
scope and stared at the smoke- 
shrouded ruins of Dakar. Sadly he 
stowed the telescope in its niche be- 
side the port. 

When Liam O’Sullivan entered 
the observatory he found Stewart, 
hands lightly braced on either side 
of the port, immersed in his own 
thoughts. Stewart’s usually sharp 
features were softened by the re- 
flected earthlight. The yellowish 
glow made the small cabin seem 
warmer than it actually was. 

“What are you listening to?’’ 
asked O’Sullivan. 

“Mozart. Symphoney number 35, 
in D major. Wrote it in 1780 some- 
thing.’’ Stewart hadn’t moved, he 
still gazed at the vast dust storms on 
the planet’s surface. 

“Nice . Will?’’ 

Stewart glanced over his shoulder 
at the other man, an inquisitive look 
on his face. 



“What are you thinkin’ so hard 
about?” 

Stewart looked out the port again. 
“I was thinking about sanity, 
Liam.” 

“Whose?” 

“Oh, just sanity in general.” He 
turned from the port and looked at 
his friend. O’Sullivan couldn’t read 
Stewart’s expression. He was 
silhouetted by the port, his face in 
shadow. “Tell me, Liam, do you 
ever feel a sense of peace 
and . separateness up here?” 

O’Sullivan nodded. “I suppose 
we all do. Will. Distance softens 
it,” he jerked his chin toward the 
port, and what was beyond. 

“Sometimes it just seems 
strange. These fantastic machines,” 
he motioned toward the softly glow- 
ing bank of computers, “the 
Mozart, all of us up here in our lit- 
tle can of air. There’s such a 
dichotomy between this, and that 
hell below. Up here cool precision, 
down there a chaotic holocaust.” 

O’Sullivan nodded slowly. The 
symphony had come to an end and 
the only sounds were those of the 
circulating vents and the soft clicks 
from the observatory tracking 
mechanisms. 

“Hell, Will,” O’Sullivan said 
softly, “you just can’t let it get to 
you.” 

“Sometimes it’s damned dif- 
ficult. There are two billion people 
down there who’re gonna be dead 
before the year is out.” 

“I know. I also know that there’s 



TOWARD THE FULLNESS OF FATE 



129 




nothing we can do about it.” 

“Nothing.” Stewart sighed deep- 
ly. “I guess you’re right. Oh, 
hell, I know you’re right. It’s been 
too late for the last six, seven years. 
Still, it’s just so . .” He shrug- 
ged. 

Any further conversation they 
might have had was interrupted by 
the sound of someone approaching 
down the companionway. The blond 
giant who flew into the compart- 
ment looked more like an avenging 
viking than the soft-spoken com- 
munications tech he really was. 
Sven Thorvald halted his forward 
flight by hooking his boot on the 
edge of the hatch. 

“What say, old sots?” he said 
with a grin. 

O’Sullivan laughed. “Typically 
dramatic entrance. Typically dis- 
oriented, too,” he added, as Thor- 
vald pulled himself into the com- 
partment and hung in front of the 
other two with his feet toward the 
“ceiling.” 

“I’ve got some dramatic news, 
lads, so be nice.” 

“I know. The People’s Democrat- 
ic Republic of Somewhere is about 
to laser us out of existance, right?” 
“Not quite that dramatic. Will. 
But almost: you’re going 

downside — ” 

“What! Will’s not scheduled for 
downside for another month!” 

“Let him talk, Liam.” 

“Thank you. As I was trying to 
say, you’re going back to earth, but 
first. Mack wants to see you.” 

130 



* * * 

“Don’t look weird at me. Will, 
I’ve got nothing to do with this,” 
Col. Mack Bennett said, as Stewart 
entered the slot that served the sta- 
tion as a wardroom. 

Stewart smiled, “I didn’t think 
you did. But I am hoping you know 
something about it.” He pulled a 
full coffee cup from the zero-gee 
dispenser and looked at the station 
commander. 

“I know a little bit; and I can 
guess some more. You are going to 
the Population Conference in Bern, 
Switzerland.” 

“You’re kidding! What for?” 

“Because you’re an expert on our 
stinking little biosphere — ” 

“The Conference is lousy with 
experts.” 

“ — and you have, literally, up- 
to-the-minute data on the world 
crop situation, and that’s what they 
need.” 

“ ‘They,’ who?” 

“You report to the chief 
negotiator for the United States, Jef- 
ferson Prima. Know him?” 

Stewart nodded. “I met him a 
few years ago when he needed 
some satellite data interpreted for 
the Third Conference. I was impress- 
ed. He knows what he’s doing.” 

“I agree,” said Bennett. “They 
want the full schmier: area maps, 
overlays, color coded, et cetera. 
Make ten sets of reflection prints 
each of all the relevant drought and 



GALAXY 




gamma-S infection data for the last 
week. Take one print for 
projection — same coverage, and 
some background film for the last 
six, eight months. Now, how soon 
can you have the last scan in hard- 
copy form, ready for display?” 

‘‘An hour, maybe less. All I have 
to do is feed the program.” 

‘‘That’s fine. There’s a shuttle 
leaving the Wheel in three hours. 
We can get you there in one of our 
tugs with time to spare. It’s taking a 
load of European scientists to 
Zurich. When you get there, you’ll 
be given a stack of stuff from Orion 
and Newgate so you’ll have world 
coverage for the last week. Then 
you fly to Bern. Okay?” 

‘‘No problem. But why only ten 
hard copies? Must be a small meet- 
ing.” 

‘‘I guess so. Also, it’s classi- 
fied.” 

“Huh?” 

‘‘No one outside the station is to 
know where you’re going or what 
you^re taking with you. It might be 
better if you didn’t tell anyone up 
either, just in case.” 

‘‘Now that is strange.” 

Bennett nodded and sucked some 
coffee into his mouth. ‘‘If anybody 
asks any questions you can tell 
them you’re due some ground time 
and you decided to take it in Swit- 
zerland. The old tourist routine, 
what? Anyway, you can leave for 
the Wheel as soon as you get your 
data together.” 

‘‘Okay, fine.” Stewart finished 
TOWARD THE FULLNESS OF FATE 



his coffee and pushed himself to- 
ward and through the hatch. He was 
thinking about sanity again, but it 
was more specific this time. 

♦ * ★ 

Stewart arrived at the Wheel with 
30 minutes to spare. The tug’s pilot 
bid him farewell and left to super- 
vise the vehicle’s refueling and the 
loading of new equipment bound for 
the observatory. 

Since the shuttle’s departure was 
imminent, Stewart didn’t leave the 
Hub; he had been weightless for 
over a month and could not have 
adjusted in the few minutes avail- 
able. Instead he boarded the 
shuttle and found a seat in the 
spacious passenger section next to 
one of the small viewports. After an 
attractive stewardess assisted him in 
strapping down he promptly fell 
asleep. 

He awoke to the sound of a warn- 
ing bell and a voice. ‘‘The shuttle is 
about to undock. All passengers 
must be strapped down. We will 
disengage five seconds after the 
warning bell sounds again, eta 
Zurich, 46 minutes.” The message 
was repeated in four other lan- 
guages and the warning bell 
sounded. 

Stewart felt a gentle pressure 
which forced him into the straps 
across his chest. The Wheel moved 
away slowly. 

‘‘Prepare for deceleration,” came 
multilingually from the speaker, and 

131 




Stewart was pressured firmly into 
his seat. As the craft’s orbital veloc- 
ity decreased and the Wheel re- 
cced into the void, Stuart felt a 
number of attitude changes nudging 
the giant spacecraft into the proper 
orientation for a re-entry. A few 
minutes later the shuttle was skip- 
ping along the top of the atmo- 
sphere in a series of shuddering 
jolts, gradually losing speed. In 
less than 20 minutes it had turned 
from space vehicle to aircraft and 
was rapidly approaching Europe and 
Switzerland. Western Europe was 
completely covered by clouds and 
Stewart spent little more time look- 
ing out the port. He had an over- 
whelming sense of fatigue; the re- 
turn from weightlessness made even 
breathing an effort. 

The ceiling was less than 50 feet 
over Zurich but the ship’s computer 
brought them down with less than 
three centimeter’s error. As the 
shuttle taxied across the huge inter- 
national air/space port, Stewart 
looked in vain for the sight of an 
Alp. Rain and heavy mist shrouded 
the landing apron. 

“Look at that!’’ A man on the 
opposite side of the aisle was point- 
ing out his port. “There’s some sort 
of skirmish going on.” His accent 
was British and he wore the light- 
blue uniform of a United Nations 
Observer. 

Stewart heard the muffled roar of 
an explosion. He quickly unstrapped 
his seatbelt and crossed the aisle to 
peer over the man’s shoulder. 

132 



“What is it?” he asked. 

“Over there, by those trucks,” 
the UN man said, pointing. 

They could faintly hear the 
angry crackle of small-arms fire. 
As the mist cleared momentar- 
ily, Stewart could see a number of 
tiny figures running in their direc- 
tion from the far edge of the field. 
Suddenly a needle with a tail of 
flame left the group of men, and 
arched toward the shuttlecraft. 

“My God,’’ murmured the 
Britisher. “That’s a rocket!” 

It seemed to move with incredible 
slowness as Stewart watched, fro- 
zen. Then, inexplicably, the rocket 
veered from its course and im- 
pacted on the runway less than 50 
meters from them. The explosion 
rocked the shuttle. 

Momentarily blinded by the bril- 
liant flash Stewart staggered back 
into the aisle. Shrill cries and a con- 
fused babble in at least four lan- 
guages filled the passenger com- 
partment. Fighting blue-white af- 
terimages, Stewart peered out the 
port again. 

“Here comes another one,” the 
Britisher said. He unstrapped him- 
self and pushed out of his seat. 
“Get down, everyone! In the aisle! 
Get away from the ports!’’ He 
dropped into the aisle and pulled 
Stewart after him. “This one may 
not miss.” 

There was an ear-splitting roar 
and Stewart was thrust painfully 
against the seats as the shuttle’s tail 
swung around. The landing gear 



GALAXY 




collapsed and the ship slid screech- 
ing across and off the runway, 
plowing a deep furrow in the rain- 
soaked grass before it came to a 
halt. 

There was a fire somewhere in 
the rear of the craft and smoke was 
beginning to fill the passenger sec- 
tion. The Britisher lifted his head 
and looked at Stewart. 

“You all right?” he asked. He 
wiped his hand absently across his 
forehead. His hand came away cov- 
ered with blood from a gash over 
his left eye. 

Stewart nodded. “I think so, how 
about you? You’re bleeding quite a 
bit.” 

He shrugged. “Head wounds al- 
ways bleed a lot. I’ve been told. It 
doesn’t hurt.” He stood. “I think 
we had better leave, don’t you?” 

The other passengers were, minor 
cuts and bruises excepted, unhurt. 
Most of them were milling about in 
the aisle when a stewardess entered 
the compartment. She spoke briefly 
with the small clusters of passengers 
as she moved down the aisle. When 
she got to Stewart and the Britisher, 
whom she addressed as Dr. Butler, 
she immediately applied a small 
sterile dressing to the man’s wound. 

“We must evacuate the shuttle, 
gentlemen. The tail section is afire, 
but we are in no immediate 
danger. ’ ’ 

“What about those chaps outside 
with the rockets?” 

“The pilot just received word 
that they have been captured. Now 

TOWARD THE FULLNESS OF FATE 



if you will go forward you will be 
able to exit via the number three 
cargo hatch.” She moved down the 
aisle to assist the remaining people 
in the rear of the compartment. 

“Well,” said Butler, “I suppose 
we had best follow the young wom- 
an’s advice.” 

Stewart nodded. He retrieved the 
photo-filled briefcase and his over- 
coat from the overhead storage 
compartment, and the two men fol- 
lowed the rest of the passengers out 
of the shuttle. 

The rain-swept runway was 
crowded with emergency vehicles 
whose revolving lights cut blue 
slices out of the heavy mist. A 
small electric bus arrived to trans- 
port the passengers to the main ter- 
minal. After all had boarded and the 
bus was about to leave a small army 
vehicle pulled up. An army officer 
got out, spoke briefly with one of 
the shuttle’s crewmen, returned to 
his car and left. 

The crewman turned to the pas- 
sengers and informed them (with 
the aid of a steward who spoke a 
couple of languages he didn’t) that 
the army officer wanted to see if 
any of the passengers could identify 
the people who had attacked the 
shuttle. They were therefore pro- 
ceeding to the opposite side of the 
field, where the survivors were 
being held. 

Butler, who had taken a seat next 
to Stewart, snorted. “Lot of good 
this will do. They’re probably 
members of some local terrorist 

133 




group.” He shrugged and looked at 
the darkening sky. 

“Why do you suppose they at- 
tacked the shuttle?” Stewart asked 
him. 

“Don’t know. It’s an easy target 
for homemade rockets—” 

“Homemade?” interrupted 
Stewart. 

Butler nodded. “They were very 
erratic and had a low velocity. Mili- 
tary rockets don’t fly like that.” 

The only survivors of the attack- 
ing party were a pair of soaking wet 
teenaged girls with their hands cuff- 
ed behind them. Two other girls 
and five boys were lying in a row 
close to the perimeter fence. 

Stewart stared at the bodies. 
Their upturned faces were so pale 
and quiet and young. The rain had 
washed most of the blood from their 
jagged wounds. The pools of red 
contrasted greatly with the green of 
the grass. He heard a buzzing in his 
ears and swayed slightly. 

Butler took hold of his elbow. 
“Steady,” he said softly. “Let’s go 
back to the bus. You don’t know 
any of them, do you?” 

Stewart shook his head and took 
some slow, deep breaths. “None of 
them look over eighteen.” 

* it ir 

The trip to Bern took less than an 
hour, ground time included. Stewart 
spent most of that time thinking 
about the incident that had cost the 
lives of eight people. He had 

134 



learned later that the stewardess 
who had helped him strap in when 
he had boarded the shuttle was 
among the dead. 

An electric Mercedes met him at 
the airport and took him to the 
Hotel Hericourt in the center of a 
new convention complex north of 
Old Bern. The hotel was furnished 
entirely in Art Nouveau. Due largly 
to the efforts of an architect named 
Carelli the century-old style had 
undergone a European renaissance. 
Within a decade many of the cities 
of Western Europe had buildings 
with stark glass, granite and stain- 
less steel exteriors and sharply con- 
trasting, almost surrealistic interiors. 
Stewart was always surprised when 
he entered one of Carelli’s build- 
ings. He felt slightly disoriented, as 
if he had accidently stepped into the 
past through some insidious door- 
shaped time machine. 

A room had already been re- 
served in Stewart’s name. As the 
bellhop carted the luggage toward 
the elevators the desk clerk called to 
Stewart that someone was waiting 
for him in the hotel lounge. 

The lounge was a large dark 
room, one wall of which was domi- 
nated by an enormous fireplace, 
with soft and unobtrusive music 
emanating from several indiscern- 
able points. As he approached the 
bar, someone called his name and a 
hand motioned from the gloom of a 
plushly padded booth adjacent to 
the fireplace. 

The figure that rose to greet 
GALAXY 




Stewart was a familiar one. “Will, 
glad you could come.” 

“Jeff,” said Stewart reaching out 
a hand, “how are you?” 

Jefferson Prima grasped Stewart’s 
hand in both of his. “Good, Will. 
Sit down. Like something to 
drink?” He waved to a passing wait- 
er. After Stewart had ordered, he 
slumped back into the soft leather 
of the booth. 

“You look tired. Will.” 

“I am. Part of it is getting accli- 
mated to gravity again.” He shrug- 
ged. “You hear about the crap in 
Zurich?” 

Prima nodded. “That’s why 1 
wanted to catch you as soon as you 
got in.” 

“I’ll admit to being flattered by 
the attention, but what’s the rush?” 
“I have reason to believe that the 
attack on the shuttle was for the 
specific purpose of destroying the 
information you are carrying.” 
Stewart’s reply was interupped by 
the return of the waiter. He waited 
until the man had left. “What the 
hell for,” he said in a low voice. 
“Everything in that case is or will 
be available through the UN info 
office.” He shook his head, feeling 
exasperated. “Which reminds me,” 
he said dryly, “I let the bellhop 
take all the stuff up to my room. He 
could be a spy, you know.” 

Prima grinned. “He probably is, 
but he was watched, and your room 
is guarded.” He held up a hand to 
forestall any comment. “Listen, 
Will. I know all this sounds terribly 



melodramatic, but it’s the truth.” 
“If they want it so bad why 
haven’t they tried again?” 

“They have, three times. We 
weren’t expecting the action at 
Zurich, but we’re ready now.” 
Stewart sipped at his drink. He 
shook his head. “You still haven’t 
said why ‘they’ are trying so hard 
to destroy data available to anyone 
who wants it.” 

“They’re convinced that it’s 
fake, and they’re sure we- plan to 
use it to convince the world that the 
situation is much worse than it ac- 
tually is so we can gain political 
leverage with the Thirds.” 

“That’s insane! You can see 
it—” 

“Tom can see it. They don’t go 
into orbit with you.” 

Stewart was silent for a few mo- 
ments. “Okay, I’ll buy it. I suppose 
they could be that stupid.” 

“They could be, and of late too 
often are.” 

“What do you want me to do?” 
“We’re going to have a top-level 
meeting tomorrow, and I want them 
to really understand how it is. No 
pulling your punches. All right?” 
“Sure, Jeff.” He held up his 
glass and stared at the swirling pat- 
terns illuminated by the light from 
the fire. “It’s a rotten situation, you 
know.” Prima nodded. “What are 
the chances these clowns will try 
another hit?” 

“Very good, but we’re covered. 
Why don’t you get some sleep. 
We’ll pick you up tomorrow mom- 



TOWARD THE FULLNESS OF FATE

ing around nine.” Prima stood up 
and dropped some bills on the table. 

Stewart stood up also, stretched 
and yawned deeply. “What are the 
chances that the sun will shine to- 
morrow?” 

“One in a million.” 

★ * * 

The sun didn’t shine the next 
day, and if the terrorists made any 
further attempts on Stewart, he didn’t 
see them. 

The meeting was held iji a build- 
ing less than a kilometer from the 
hotel. Most of the buildings within 
the convention complex were inter- 
connected by a system of tunnels. 
Small electric cars carried delegates 
to and from their destinations with- 
out regard to bothersome weather or 
traffic. 

The room was a large one with a 
highly polished oak table in its 
center. The table was at least two 
meters wide and five meters long. 
Heavy armchairs, all red leather, 
brass studs and dark wood, sur- 
rounded the table. With only nine 
men present, the room seemed de- 
serted. 

Stewart sat close to the head of 
the table and watched the others, 
while Prima discussed some incom- 
prehensible matters of form with the 
delegates. 

As Prima spoke, Stewart noticed 
that he had a lot more gray in his 
hair than when Stewart had met him 
at the earlier conference. Stewart 
remembered with a start that they 

136 



were the same age, but Prima 
looked years older than he should 
have. 

Stewart had arranged his photo- 
graphic displays in the proper se- 
quence to match the information he 
was going to project on a large day- 
light screen at the far end of the 
room. Prima introduced Stewart but 
he did not identify any of the 
others. Stewart could tell the na- 
tional origin of some from the ac- 
cents, but had no idea who they 
were. 

Stewart addressed the group for 
almost two hours. They asked few 
questions, and none of them seemed 
surprised by the data he presented. 
As he had said to Prima the night 
before, the situation was not good. 
He talked about droughts in Africa, 
the Ukraine, and Midwest America. 
He showed the results of floods in 
India, Central and South America. 
He talked about the gradual cooling 
of the atmosphere; the effect of the 
circumpolar vortex on rain patterns; 
the problems caused by particulate 
matter suspended in the atmosphere^ 
the ruination of crops by increased 
ultra-violet radiation due to destruc- 
tion of vast amounts of ozone. He 
talked about problems caused by the 
“Green Revolution” and the wide- 
spread use of hybrid grains. He*' 
showed them the latest photographs 
documenting the spread of the vor- 
acious plant virus called gamma-5, 
which was in the process of de- 
cimating 62% of the world’s wheat , 
crop. 

GALAXY 




When the last slide had faded 
from the screen, Stewart stared at 
the blank whiteness for the few sec- 
onds before he turned to the somber- 
faced men seated around the oak ta- 
ble. He tapped his leg lightly with 
the pointer he had used during the 
discussion. “So, there you are. Any 
questions?” 

“If only we had stuck with the 
slower growing varieties,” one of 
the delegates said softly. He was 
looking at a photograph showing the 
gamma-5 infection. He didn’t seem 
to be speaking to anyone in particu- 
lar. 

“It would not have helped, 
Nikoli,” said another. 

“Crop failures could have been 
localized,” the first man said. 

“That’s just for wheat,” said 
Prima, “and just for one disease.” 

“If not for the hybrid crops this 
calamity would have come five 
years ago,” said still another dele- 
gate. 

“Yes, and who could have 
foretold these climatic changes? 
Weather patterns have been favor- 
able, and getting better for the last 
five years, until now, until this 
year. ’ ’ 

Gradually all of the delegates had 
begun to argue, and Stewart stood 
there, astounded, thinking: Our 
lives depend on these men, our 
lives . 

Prima stood up. “Gentlemen, 
please. Gentlemen!” 

There was a sharp crack, like the 
sound of a rifle. There was im- 

TOWARD THE FULLNESS OF FATE 



mediate silence and everyone was 
looking at Stewart. He had hit the 
table with the metal pointer. He 
hadn’t realized he had done it until 
they looked at him. He looked at 
the pointer as if he couldn’t re- 
member where he’d gotten it, then 
he shook his head slightly and toss- 
ed the pointer onto the table. 

“Thanks, Will,” said Prima with 
a grin. 

Stewart shrugged. 

“Gentlemen,” Prima said, “I 
think we had better adjourn now. I 
think we could use a little break. 
I’d like to thank Dr. Stewart for his 
excellent briefing.” There was a 
smattering of applause. Prima 
looked at his watch. “It’s almost 
noon. 1 think we ought to reconvene 
here about two o’clock. Any objec- 
tions? Good, two it is.” He turned 
to Stewart as the others left the con- 
ference room. 

“You’ve been a great help. Will. 
Thank you.” 

“Is that all you’ll be needing me 
for?” 

Prima nodded. “What do you 
want to do now? Go back to the sta- 
tion? Want a vacation? I can ar- 
range it for you, if you like. Go 
anwhere you want, two weeks, a 
month. You name it.” 

“You’ve got that kind of pull?” 

Prima nodded again. “ ’Fraid 
so.” 

“I think I’ll go back up to the 
station. It’s . well, a lot quieter 
up there.” 

“I kind of thought you might do 

137 




that. I envy that access to quiet. 
There aren’t many places on earth 
that are quiet anymore. Besides, 
you might as well enjoy it while 
you can.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“When things fall apart down 
here, do you think people are going 
to want to spend money on space? 
The stations will probably be aban- 
doned; at least for a while.” 

“We’ve talked about it up there, 
but I’ve never heard it sound so offi- 
cial.” 

“It’s not official,” Prima smiled. 
“It’s just a possibility that has to be 
considered. Hell, enough of this 
gloom. Let’s go to lunch and then 
I’ll arrange to have you back in 
space before midnight, okay?” 
“Sounds good.” 

In the elevator down to the park- 
ing garage, Prima described their 
destination in Old Bern. “It’s called 
the Ermitage on Marktgasse. The 
cuisine is French, and it’s magnifi- 
cent. On the way you’ll get to see 
the Zeitglocken, their famous clock 
tower built in the twelfth century. 
In fact, all of that area is fantastic. 
Marktgasse used to be the main 
street. Lots of old buildings, foun- 
tains, little shops, and so forth. It’s 
closed to traffic, so we’ll have to 
walk a little. Got your rain coat?” 
“Is it still raining out there?” 
Stewart frowned. “You know, I 
haven’t seen one mountain yet. We 
might as well be in Kansas.” 

Prima laughed. “We can take the 
Mercedes into Old Bern,” he said 



as they stepped out of the elevator. 

As the car approached, Stewart 
could see one man sitting next to 
the driver and another in the back. 
‘‘We’ve got company,” said 
Stewart. 

“Guards. Marines from the em- 
bassy.” He saw Stewart’s question- 
ing look. “Just because the meeting 
is over doesn’t mean the terrorists 
are through trying.” 

He turned to Prima, exasperated. 
“How long am I going to have to 
keep looking over my shoulder?” 

“Once you’re out of Switzerland 
you shouldn’t have any trouble. 
You’ll be out of it.” They entered 
the car and it pulled our into the 
street. 

“I guess you won’t be out of it,” 
Stewart said. 

“No,” Prima sighed. “I suppose 
I could be. 1 could quit this damn 
job, go back to Ohio, write 
textbooks and my memoirs.” He 
grinned suddenly. ‘‘I guess I’ve 
come to believe in my own impor- 
tance too much to quit.” He stared 
musingly out the window at the 
treelined street. “So much depends 
on what we do here in the next 
week. It’s rather terrifying.” 

Both men were silent as the car 
moved into Bern’s Old Section. 
Prima’s mood changed again 
shortly, and he began to name the 
buildings they passed. Lost in his 
own thoughts, Stewart heard little 
of it. 

They were moving rapidly along 
Tiefenau-Strasse . The river Aare, 



138 



GALAXY 




sometimes visible through the trees 
and buildings, was about 100 me- 
ters to their left. As they reached the 
junction with Neubruck-Strasse, an 
old Volkswagen bus pulled into 
their path. The driver of the Mer- 
cedes swerved to avoid a collision, 
ran over the high curb and struck a 
low iron fence. The driver opened 
the door, ready to leap out and ac- 
cost the driver of the Volkswagen. 
The Marine sitting next to him 
grabbed him around the neck and 
hauled him back into the car. 

The side door of the Volkswagen 
slid open and three men leaped out 
and ran towards the Mercedes. The 
Marine reached over the driver for 
the door. It was just beyond his 
grasp. The first of the three reached 
the open door and thrust the barrel 
of a small shotgun into the car and 
blew the Marine’s face off. 

The Marine next to Prima and 
Stewart had pushed them both to 
the floor of the car before it 
had stopped moving. As the first 
Marine was blasted back into the 
car, the second fired half a dozen 
explosive rounds into the chest of 
the man with the shotgun. 

“Shut the fucking door!’’ the 
Marine screamed. 

The blood-drenched driver made 
a grab for the door and one of the 
terrorists caught his arm, pulled him 
into the street, and dispatched him 
bloodily with a machine pistol. 

The other terrorist fired at the 
Marine through the rear window of 
the car, but the bullets splattered 

TOWARD THE FULLNESS OF FATE 



against the thick glass, causing 
spider web patterns. 

The same glass that protected the 
occupants of the car protected the 
terrorists surrounding it. The Marine 
could see the man with the machine 
pistol pull the pin on a small gre- 
nade, silently count the few sec- 
ond’s delay and, at the last mo- 
ment, toss the grenade into the front 
seat of the car where it burst, im- 
mediately filling the car with a 
choking, eye-searing, blue-white 
narcotic smoke. The three men in 
the car lost consciousness. 

★ ★ * 

/ must be alive, Stewart thought, 
because I hurt like Hell! Stewart’s 
hands were bound behind his back 
in a painful position. A teeth- 
rattling vibration coupled with a 
deafening roar served to round out 
his acute discomfort. He groaned 
and tried to straighten out his legs. 
“This one’s awake!’’ a voice yelled 
above the deep roar. 

Stewart’s eyes burned and every- 
thing was obscured by a watery 
haze as he was pulled roughly to a 
sitting position. He gasped as pain 
shot through his shoulders and 
arms. He blinked to clear his eyes. 

His tormentor was a young man 
dressed in light green fatigues. 
“Listen to me, spaceman!’’ he 
shouted. “Don’t give us any trouble 
or we’ll toss you overboard! Got 
it?” The man slapped Stewart with 
the back of his hand. The sharp 
stinging blow brought tears to his 

139 




eyes again. He could taste blood 
from a cut lip. 

Stewart nodded. “I understand,” 
he croaked, not at all sure he under- 
stood anything. 

“All right, now shut up!” The 
man shoved him back on the floor 
and moved away. 

The trip lasted an eternity of 
slightly less than three hours. 
Stewart was pulled to his feet and 
held between two men in front of a 
sliding door. He realized for the 
first time that he was in a helicop- 
ter. As the copter settled to ground, 
he could see that they were deep in 
the mountains, in a narrow glacial 
valley. For the first time since his 
return to Earth he could see the sun. 

The door was pulled open while 
the copter was still a few meters 
from the ground and Stewart was 
treated to a little joke as his captors 
playfully thrust him out the door, 
then pulled him back. 

When the copter touched down 
they shoved him roughly out and he 
just managed to keep his balance. 
He stumbled forward and turned 
just in time to see Prima, less fortu- 
nate than he, sprawl heavily into the 
wet meadow grass. 

As soon as a great mound of 
equipment had been unloaded — 
rather more gently than the 
prisoners — and carried into the 
trees, the copter lifted and headed 
back down the valley at high speed. 

Three of the terrorists, armed 
with formidable-looking automatic 
weapons, had remained with them. 



One of them indicated that Stewart 
and Prima should move into the 
trees and sit. When they had done 
so he squatted a short distance from 
them with his back against a tree. 
His machine gun wasn’t pointed di- 
rectly at them but the man was ob- 
viously alert. The other two pulled 
an assortment of plastic-wrapped 
breads, cheeses, and sausages from 
an old rucksack. Another rucksack 
yielded three unlabeled bottles of 
wine. As the three ate, their guard’s 
eyes never left his prisoners. 

When Stewart sat down beside 
Prima he had thought they might be 
prevented from talking, but the 
gunmen didn’t seem to care. 

“You hurt very much?” Stewart 
asked. 

Prima shook his head. “No. My 
muscles ache, but that’s all. How 
about you?” 

“I’m okay.” He looked at their 
captors. “Who the Hell are these 
clowns? Do you have any idea what 
they want with us?” 

“Possibly ransom. I don’t think 
they took us just to kill us; they 
could have done that at the car. Of 
course, I might be wrong.” 

“One of them called me ‘space- 
man,’ so I assume they know who I 
am. Must have figured I’d be worth 
something. I’m not sure to 
whom . .’’He grinned crookedly. 

When the guard finished eating 
he called to the others. One of them 
untied Stewart’s and Prima’s hands 
and gave them food and wine. 

Occasionally, one of the men 



140 



GALAXY 




scanned the valley with a pair of 
binoculars. It was less than half an 
hour after the helicopter had 
dropped them in the valley that the 
man’s search was rewarded. He 
stood up, called softly to his com- 
panions, and pointed up the valley. 

Prima looked over his shoulder 
then turned back, disgustedly. 
“Horsemen! Bloody barbarians.” 
Within minutes of being sighted, 
the riders had entered the small 
camp and dismounted. There were 
four riders and twelve horses. All 
but the man guarding them and one 
of the riders began to pack the 
equipment onto the horses. The one 
rider was at least two meters tall 
and possessed a bushy black mous- 
tache. As he approached the cap- 
tives he pulled thick leather gloves 
off his hands and smiled disarm- 
ingly. 

“Dr. Prima,” he said, thrusting 
out his hand. “We meet under un- 
fortunate circumstances. I trust 
you’re unharmed?” He turned to 
Stewart. “And you must be Dr. 
Stewart.” Again he put out his 
hand and, reflexively, Stewart 
clasped it. 

“You have the advantage, sir,” 
said Prima. 

The man grinned. “In more ways 
than one. I’m called Draken.” 
“Well, Mr. Draken—” 

“No mister; just Draken.” 
“Draken. Maybe you could ex- 
plain what you want with us.” 

“All in good time. Right now we 
have to travel quite a distance. Can 



you ride?” Both men nodded. 
“Good.” 

Draken called out to one of the 
riders and the other brought two 
wool-lined, hooded coats. “You’ll 
need these. We have to cross a high 
pass. No snow this time of year, 
but it’s still too cold for what 
you’re wearing.” He turned and 
walked away to examine the prog- 
ress of the loading. 

Stewart had not been on a horse 
since he was a child. He still ached 
from the hours he had spent tied up 
in the helicopter. The ascent to the 
pass and the descent into another 
narrow glacial valley took four tor- 
turous hours. 

When he was finally allowed to 
dismount, Stewart’s legs wouldn’t 
hold him and he had to hold onto 
his horse to keep from falling to the 
ground. Prima, he noticed, hadn’t 
fared much better. 

In the deep blue evening 
shadows, Stewart could see a clus- 
ter of small stone buildings into 
which the men were carrying the 
equipment. Their guard was still 
close, still silent. 

As Draken passed one time, 
Stewart called out. “Why the Hell 
couldn’t the helicopter have brought 
us all the way?’ ’ 

The man’s smile was wide and 
his teeth looked abnormally white in 
the darkness. “Security. The people 
on the chopper have no idea where 
this camp is.” 

“Are we still in Switzerland?” 
asked Prima. 



TOWARD THE FULLNESS OF FATE 



141 




“Does it matter?” asked Draken. 

“When are you going to fill us in 
on the master plan?” said Prima. 

“In a few minutes. Do you see 
that small house? The third on the 
left?” He pointed. “Go there, up- 
stairs, and wait.” 

Draken watched them as they 
limped slowly toward the little stone 
house, their ever-present shadow 
with the machine gun a few paces 
behind. 

A young technician loaded down 
with electronic gear almost collided 
with Draken in the deepening dark- 
ness. “Sorry,” she said. 

“No harm done,” he said. “Do 
me a favor? When you’ve delivered 
that stuff, tell Wolf we’re ready. 
Okay?” 

‘‘Sure, Draken.” She hurried 
away. 

The stone stairs to the second 
story were on the outside of the 
building. A heavy curtain hung in 
the doorway. Stewart pushed passed 
it into a short passage and under 
another curtain. The room was 
empty except for a rough wooden 
table and a dozen straightbacked 
chairs. The light came from three 
electric lanterns suspended from 
ceiling beams. The windows were 
covered with black cloth. 

Within minutes, people began to 
enter the room. None of them said 
anything to Stewart or Prima, who 
had taken seats facing the curtained 
door. Three men and one woman 
were facing Stewart and Prima 
when Draken entered, accompanied 

142 



by a small, intense man. Draken 
took a chair near the door, while 
the other man sat on the table in 
front of the prisoners. He had a 
small tape recorder which he placed 
beside him and switched on. 

The man had light brown hair 
and piercing, pale blue eyes. He 
leaned forward, his elbows on his 
knees, his face less than half a 
meter from Prima’ s. 

“My name is Wolf,” he said. 
His accent was German. “I am the 
leader of this cadre. Each of the 
people here is representing a differ- 
ent, international political-action 
group. Your abduction was ordered 
for the purpose of obtaining con- 
firming information and statements 
relevant to your country’s true posi- 
tion on the present world crisis.” 
‘‘Why am I here?” asked 
Stewart. 

“We have known of your com- 
plicity in this plot for some time. 
Dr. Stewart, and you were recog- 
nized by one of those assigned to 
abduct Dr. Prima. He felt you could 
be of some use to us.” 

“What the hell is this ‘plot’ I’m 
Involved in?” said Stewart. 

The woman laughed, but there 
was no humor in it. “We are not 
playing games, Stewart,” she said. 
Her voice was deceptively gentle, 
soft — and frightening. 

“Maybe we should play their 
game for a while,” Draken said. 
“Explain it to them as if they had 
no idea what we’re talking about — ” 
“I don’t,” interrupted Stewart. 



GALAXY 




“ — and maybe they’ll realize 
how stupid it is to lie to us.” 

Wolf nodded. “Also, he could 
actually be a dupe. It is not very 
likely considering the evidence, but 
who can tell?” 

Wolf turned to face Stewart di- . 
rectly. “You were ordered to pre- 
pare documents and deliver them to 
Dr. Prima. True?” 

Stewart nodded. 

“These documents were falsified 
to show the world situation to be 
much worse than it is.” He held up 
his hand as Stewart opened his 
mouth. “Wait. First listen, then 
comment. 

“The purpose of this falsified in- 
formation was to convince the Third 
World that its only hope for survi- 
val is complete submission to the 
Western capitalist states and their 
lackeys. Actually, there are vast 
grain surpluses throughout the U.S. 
and Canada which are being witheld 
to force a political ideology on the 
Third World by using the threat of 
famine. A famine which would not 
naturally occur.” 

Stewart sat in stunned silence for 
a few moments. He glanced at 
Prima who was engrossed with a 
hangnail. 

“I think you are serious,” said 
Stewart. 

“Believe me. Dr. Stewart, we 
are.” 

“Then you’re insane.” 

“Then you deny the charge?” 

“(jood God, man! Not three days 
ago, from orbit, I looked down on 



the ruins of Dakar. It was destroyed 
in the food riots. All of Central Af- 
rica is a dust bowl! The Ukraine, 
Northern India, Mid-west America, 
Indo-China — you name it — all the 
same! Droughts, floods, the 
gamma-5 pandemic — ” 

“Lies,” said Wolf. 

Stewart shook his head. He 
turned to Prima. “Jeff, tell him.” 
Prima smiled wearily. “There is 
no way to convince this man. Will, 
short of taking him into orbit to see 
for himself.” He leaned back in his 
chair and contemplated \Wolfs ex- 
pressionless face. 

“I do not think this is an effec- 
tive method. Wolf,” the young 
woman said. 

“You always did prefer the more 
direct means,” Wold replied. 

He turned to Prima again. “What 
have you to say to the charge?” 
“You’re wrong about our plans.” 
Wolfs eyebrows went up, show- 
ing his doubt. 

“What I intend to propose,” con- 
tinued Prima, “is a worldwide aid 
plan that involves all the developed 
countries. A plan to give food, 
machinery, medicine, et cetera, to 
the Thirds, no strings attached.” 
Stewart, who had been listening 
with a growing look of amazement, 
laughed. “You’re totally insane, 
too!” 

Ignoring Stewart, Wolf shook his 
head. “If you think I’d believe that, 
your naivete is astonishing.” 

“I think I can prove it,” Prima 
said. 



TOWARD THE FULLNESS OF FATE 



143 




“How?” said Draken. 

“I noticed that my briefcase was 
among the things loaded on the 
horses. Look in it.” 

Wolf glanced over his shoulder at 
Draken. “True?” 

Draken nodded. “We got it. 
Haven’t had, time to look through 
it yet.” 

Five silent minutes had passed 
when Draken pushed through the 
curtain carrying the briefcase. At 
Wolf’s direction, he handed it to 
Prima. As Prima flipped the latch, 
the guard moved behind his back 
and loudly cocked his weapon. 

Prima pulled a thin folder from 
the case and handed it to Wolf. 
“Look through that.” 

With Draken looking over his 
shoulder. Wolf quickly scanned the 
short document. He slowly shut the 
folder and looked up. 

“He’s telling the truth about 
this,” he tapped the folder. “They 
do plan to recommend an aid pro- 
gram.” 

“Uon’t get it,” said one of the 
men at the table. He spoke with an 
American accent. His words were 
slightly slurred due to the lack of 
upper front teeth. 

The man seated next to him at 
the table cleared his throat. “For 
once, Jerry has a point. I do not 
‘get it’ either.” The speaker was a 
tall black man, taller even than 
Draken, who sounded like he had 
learned his English at Oxford. 

While the two spoke. Wolf stared 
at Prima, a frown on his face. 



When the others at the table started 
to join in. Wolf held up his hand. 

“All right!” he shouted. “Shut 
up!” 

Wolf looked from Prima to 
Stewart and back again. “Stewart, 
you say your documents are not 
fakes?” 

Stewart nodded, puzzled. 

The murmur began again but 
ceased when Wolf again held up his 
hand. He slowly began to look 
through Prima’s briefcase. He 
pulled a set of the prints Stewart 
had brought from the orbital obser- 
vatory. He looked at each print and 
read the brief explanation printed on 
the back. 

Wolf pushed himself off the table 
and turned to the others who were 
seated around the room. “This part 
is over. Clear out.” 

“What the Hell!” said Jerry. 
“You can’t throw us out like that.” 

“Yes, Jerry, I can,” said Wolf, 
with deadly softness. “You 
know — or should know — I can do 
whatever I feel I must to achieve a 
successful conclusion to this mis- 
sion. And I do not have to explain 
anything I do to you. Now I want 
everyone out, with the exception of 
Draken.” He turned to the guard 
behind Prima. “Give your weapon 
to Draken and leave.” 

Draken took the machine gun and 
went to Wolf’s side as the guard 
left the room. 

The tall African stood up slowly 
and stretched. “If Wolf wants us to 
leave, he has a good reason. But 



144 



GALAXY 




good reason or not, he was chosen 
as our commander for this jaunt and 
his word is our law.” 

He left the room followed by the 
others. Jerry, the last out, paused 
with his hand on the curtain, a look 
of intense hatred on his face. He 
opened his mouth to speak, then 
simply shook his head and left. 

Wolf snapped the recorder off 
and sat in one of the vacated chairs. 
“You shits are going to pull a fast 
one, aren’t you?” he said. “I’ve 
got the feeling that the whole popu- 
lation conference is a sham.” 

Prima said nothing, his expres- 
sion blank. 

“Draken, what do you think they 
are planning?” asked Wolf. 

“Well, if the situation is as bad 
as Stewart says it is — and person- 
ally I believe it is — then the plan 
Prima’s recommending is useless.” 
Wolf nodded. “I agree. Tell us, 
Prima. Why are you going to re- 
commend this worthless crap.” 

“I thought you didn’t believe this 
stuff,” Stewart said, tapping the 
photos. 

“Let us say ‘officially,” I can’t 
believe it. Realistically, I can’t ig- 
nore it.” 

“Why do you think he sent the 
others out?” said Draken. “We don’t 
need that bullshit rhetoric now.” 
“Stewart, listen!” Wolf said. “If 
it is necessary to bend reality to ac- 
complish our goals we will do it. 
Prima and I are on different sides of 
the political fence, but he uses the 
same tactics that I do!” 

TOWARD THE FULLNESS OF FATE 



“Not quite,” interjected Prima. 

“Oh?” 

“You murdered three people 
when you kidnapped us,” said 
Stewart. 

“Stewart, unless I’m mistaken, 
Prima is planning the murder of ap- 
proximately two billion people. The 
man could go down in history — if 
anyone’s left to write it — as the 
most despicable mass murderer the 
human race has ever known.” 

“What the hell are you talking 
about?” Stewart shouted. 

“Use your head, man!” Wolf 
shouted back. “These bastards are 
going to tell the biggest lie in his- 
tory. They are going to say: ‘We 
are going to help you, we will do 
this and do that and everything will 
be fine.’ Like Hell! What they are 
going to do is stall around until ev- 
eryone in Asia, Africa and Latin 
America is stone dead from 
famine.” He turned to Draken. 
“What do you think?” 

“I read it the same way. The 
question is why?” 

“Yes,” said Wolf, nodding. 
“Any comment, Prima?” 

“That’s the most ridiculous piece 
of sophistry I’ve ever heard,” he 
said calmly. 

Wolf sighed deeply; it was the 
answer he had expected. Abruptly 
he stood up. “Put these two in their 
cage, Draken. We can let Maria 
work on them tomorrow.” He left 
the room without a glance or 
another word. 

“Maria’s not a nice lady,” Dra- 

145 




ken said. “She’ll probably get Jerry 
to help. He’s nasty, too.” 

“What do you expect to find 
out?” Stewart said. 

“They’ll probably try to get 
Prima to verify Wolfs accusation. 
If they do, then they’ll want to 
know the motive.” 

“I thought he didn’t want them 
to know,” said Prima. 

Draken smiled. “No, that’s not 
why he sent them out. They have a 
habit of arguing pointless nuances 
for hours on end. It makes it hard 
for Wolf to concentrate.” 

“Why did he let you stay?” 

“He trusts me. We’ve known 
each other for a long time.” He 
moved toward the door. “Now I’ll 
take you to where you’re going to 
spend the night.” 

They followed him down the nar- 
row stone steps and across the 
“main street” of the tiny village. 
Their path was marked by small, 
hooded globes that glowed with a 
dim blue light. Stewart could see 
lines of the small lights branching 
off in various directions. The night 
was very cold. 

They climbed another set of ex- 
terior steps. Draken pulled a heavy 
wooden door open and the men 
stepped into a narrow passage and 
pushed under a thick black curtain 
into a small, windowless room. A 
small electric lantern, giving off a 
harsh light, hung from the ceiling. 
There were two folding cots set up 
with a stack of heavy wool blankets 
on each. 



“Somewhat primitive,” said 
Draken, “but I hope you’ll find it 
adequate. There’s food if you want 
it.” He motioned toward some plas- 
tic-wrapped packages sitting on a 
small table in the corner. “There 
will be an armed guard outside. 
Good night, gentlemen.” 

The door closed softly. They 
heard the rasp of an iron bolt being 
thrust into place. 

Stewart sat down on one of the 
cots with a groan of fatigue. The 
cot creaked. “What the Hell are we 
gonna do?” 

“I don’t know. Will,” Prima 
said, as he stretched out on his cot. 
“I really don’t know.” 

* * ★ 

Stewart awoke with a start. His 
heart was beating painfully fast. 
Someone had unbolted the door and 
entered the room. The lantern was 
out and Stewart could see nothing. 
He sat up quietly. 

“Don’t say anything, Stewart.” 
The voice was muffled, but he rec- 
ognized it as Draken’s. 

The lantern flooded the room 
with brilliance and Stewart winced. 
Draken’s head was enclosed in a 
bulky black bubble. There was a 
single, huge lens in the center of 
the thing. He held the straps of two 
more black helmets in his hand. 
The other hand held two rucksacks 
and a machine gun. He was dressed 
in a one-piece black suit and had 
another rucksack strapped to his 



146 



GALAXY 




back. He looked like an astronaut, 
suited up for an EVA — except that 
the image was negative: black suit 
rather than white. 

He set the rucksacks on the floor 
and sat down on the cot next to 
Stewart, still holding the helmets 
and the gun. 

From across the room, Prima 
grunted and pushed his head from 
under the blankets. “What’s going 
on?” 

Draken lifted the helmet off and 
put it next to his feet. “We’re leav- 
ing. I’m taking you out of here, 
back to Bern.” He slipped his 
rucksack off and put it next to his 
helmet. 

“You’re letting us go?” said 
Stewart. 

Prima pushed his covers off and 
reached for his shoes. He slept in 
his clothes. 

“No, I’m not letting you go: I’m 
helping you escape.” 

“Jesus,” Stewart said, “this is 
too much for me.” 

“Are you DCI?” Prima asked. 

Draken nodded. “Sort of. Branch 
of it.” 

“This is going to blow your 
cover for good.” 

Draken shrugged. “It’s worth 
it.” 

“DCI?” said Stewart. 

“I work for an American intelli- 
gence agency,” Draken said, bend- 
ing over one of the rucksacks. He 
withdrew a small wad of black 
cloth. “This is an Army surplus 
jump suit, like I’m wearing. It’ll 




TOWARD THE FULLNESS OF FATE 



keep you warm even in a blizzard. 
I’ve got boot liners, too. Keep your 
feet warm and dry.” What he pull- 
ed out looked like a thin pair of 
socks. 

‘‘Are we walking out?” asked 
Prima. 

‘‘It’s the only way. Horses can’t 
go the way we have to go.” 

‘‘God,” said Stewart, pulling on 
the jump suit. ‘‘I hate those 
horses.” 

Draken held up one of the black 
helmets. ‘‘This is also Army 
surplus. A Star Scope by name.” 

He slipped the thing over 
Stewart’s head. It was a snug fit 
and Stewart mumbled about the 
helmet’s weight. Draken snapped 
the visor up, made an adjustment, 
and pushed it down again. 

Stewart’s perception of the room 
altered sickeningly. The lens cov- 
ered almost a full 180 '’ and it was 
all compressed onto the small, 
wrap-around screen on the inside of 
the visor. He could see his feet and 
the ceiling at the same time, all in a 
pale greenish-white tint. 

Draken slurped across the screen 
and cut the lantern off. Everything 
in the room was still discernible, 
but Just barely. The light source 
seemed to come from Draken’s 
hand. Stewart realized suddenly 
that the room was illuminated by 
the glowing numerals on Draken’s 
watch. 

‘‘It’ll be much brighter outside. 
There are no clouds tonight.” He 
switched the lantern on again and 

148 



the lens automatically closed down 
with a faint whir. ‘‘Leave the Scope 
on, Stewart. Walk around and get 
used to the viewscreen. Here’s your 
helmet, Prima. You do the same. 
There are receivers in the helmets, 
and I’ve got throat mikes for each 
of us.” 

In a short time, both men could 
walk without tripping over their 
own feet and Draken decided they 
should leave. He adjusted their 
rucksacks and checked their helmets 
and throat mikes. He bent over his 
own rucksack and when he stood up 
he held two small machine pistols 
with holsters and belts. Stewart 
noted that they were the same type 
that had been used so efficiently 
during his capture in Bern. 

‘‘I don’t expect you’ll have to 
use these,” said Draken, handing 
the weapons to each man, ‘‘but it 
won’t hurt to have them in case. 
Don’t use them in the village — 
under any circumstances — or we’ve 
bought it. We must get out of camp 
undetected.” He pulled his helmet 
on and shrugged his rucksack into 
place. As he passed under the lan- 
tern he shattered it with a casual 
swing of his gun barrel. 

‘‘Don’t trip over the guard,” 
Draken said, his voice tinny in the 
helmet’s receiver. 

They stepped over the prostrate 
figure Just outside the door and onto 
the stone stairs. Through their hel- 
mets the dim blue lights lit the 
small village better than floodlights 
could have. 



GAUXY 




Stewart paused momentarily and 
Draken touched him lightly on the 
arm, correctly evaluating the reason 
for his hesitation. “Don’t worry, 
it’s only bright for us.’’ 

“Doesn’t anyone else have these 
Star Scopes?’’ asked Prima. 

Draken chuckled. “Not any 
more.’’ 

They went around the side of the 
house and headed for the trees 
standing about 100 meters from the 
village. 

The valley was U shaped, with a 
reasonably flat floor between two 
steep walls. Once in the trees, they 
headed up the valley, closest to the 
cliff on their left. To their right a 
small stream glowed with a faint 
phosphorescence. 

“There’s a pass about four 
kilometers from here,’’ Draken said 
as they walked. “We have to cross 
over to the next valley. There’s a 
transmitter up there I stashed about 
three days ago — ’’ 

“Were you expecting this?’’ in- 
terrupted Stewart. 

“No. Three days ago I didn’t 
even know why we came here. I 
just like to have a bolt hole. 

“Anyway,” Draken continued, 
“we’ll be picked up a half-hour 
after I put in the call.” 

A little over 40 minutes after they 
started the three men stood at the 
base of a narrow crack in the face 
of the cliff. 

“It’s an almost vertical climb for 
about 100 meters, then a gentle 
slope up and over to the next val- 

TOWARD THE FULLNESS OF FATE 



ley. The climb isn’t too difficult, 
but you’ll have to watch what 
you’re doing.” 

As Draken had promised, their 
upward route wasn’t very arduous, 
but it was time consuming. All 
three men were close to exhaustion 
by the time they were 100 meters 
above the valley floor. 

After a short rest, they started up 
the slope and soon emerged from 
the towering cliffs and stood over- 
looking another quiet valley. 
Stewart stood near the edge of the 
steep drop for a few moments and 
then turned back to where the other 
two were sitting. 

“This looks rougher than the one 
we came up,” he said. 

“We don’t have to climb down,” 
said Draken. “The transmitter is 
about a half-kilometer from here.” 
He pointed parallel to the cliff’s 
edge. “Along that ridge.” Draken 
stood up. 

Within minutes the three stood 
under a low rock overhang where 
Draken had hidden the transmitter. 
As Draken moved toward the back 
of the shelter, Prima sat down just 
beyond the overhanging rock and 
pulled his helmet off. With a sigh 
of relief Stewart followed suit. The 
night was cold and dark, the stars 
like diamond chips on black satin. 
Stewart could just distinguish Pri- 
ma’ s form sitting less than a meter 
from him. 

They sat in silence for a long 
while, then Stewart shifted his body 
a little closer to Prima. 



149 




“Jeff?” said Stewart hesitantly. 
“What is it, Will?” 

“I’ve been thinking about what 
Wolf said back there . He 
paused again. 

“You want to know if he guessed 
right.” Pritna sighed deeply. 

At that point Draken joined them. 
“Had some trouble with the 
transmitter at first but it’s okay 
now. I got the message off.” He 
had his helmet visor raised, but they 
couldn’t see his face. “I heard what 
you were saying,” he tapped his 
helmet and Stewart realized his 
throat mike was still transmitting. 
“I’d like to hear the answer.” 

Prima was silent for a few mo- 
ments. “Hell,” he said softly, his 
voice barely audible above the 
wind. “Hell, why not? Of course 
he was right. Right on all counts.” 
“Damn,” said Draken, quietly. 
“I’d kind of hoped ... oh, shit.” 
“Is that it?” said Stewart. 
“What?” 

“Man calmly says: ‘Yeah, uh 
we’re gonna kill a couple billion 
people.’ What the hell is that? 
Why? Why is it necessary to lie, to 
give them false hopes? That could 
push the death rate up a lot higher 
than it has to go. How can you pos- 
sibly justify what you plan to do?” 
“Justify it?” Prima said, a sharp 
edge to his voice. “It’s what must 
be done.” 

“How can you sit there and cold- 
ly condemn billions of humans to 
death as a matter of necessity?” 
Stewart shouted. 

150 



“Damn it. Will,” Prima shouted 
back, “I didn’t condemn them! I’ve 
been screaming my head off for the 
last twenty years! No one wanted to 
listen. It wasn’t profitable, politi- 
cally or ecomomically. Greed and 
bullheaded stupidity got us here, 
and now the only road out leads 
straight through a die-off!” 

“What do you mean ‘it’s what 
must be done’?” Draken inter- 
jected. 

Prima sat with his elbows on his 
knees, his expression one of intense 
pain. His voice was tired when he 
spoke. “It’s a calculated risk. Will. 
If we stand back and say: ‘Sorry, 
but it’s your own fault, and we 
can’t do anything to get you out of 
it,’ they will tear us apart. In a 
few months they can pull us down 
with them. If we want any faint 
chance of surviving what’s coming 
we have got to get them down be- 
fore they realize their fall is inevita- 
ble.” 

“How can you be so sure?” 
asked Draken. 

“No one is sure. We know one 
course of action leads to certain an- 
nihilation. The other gives us about 
one chance in five of greeting the 
twenty-first century as something 
more than stoneage barbarians.” 

“I don’t like the idea of walking 
over two billion dead bodies to get 
there,” said Stewart. 

“I don’t know anyone who does. 
I’m sure it won’t — ” 

He stopped, stunned, as a blind- 
ingly harsh light flashed into being 

GALAXY 




directly overhead, freezing them 
into immobility. 

“Down!” yelled Draken. In one 
continuous movement he grabbed 
the front of Prima’s jump suit and 
pulled him to the ground and kicked 
Stewart backward off the rock he 
was sitting on. 

Stewart landed heavily on his 
back, breath knocked out but 
otherwise unhurt. The light cast 
dense black shadows that shifted 
with confusing rapidity. 

Suddenly Draken was beside him 
with his helmet. “Put this on! 
That’s Wolf out there, and I’ve got 
a feeling we’re going to have a bit 
of a go ’round, wot?” 

The flare still hung in the sky 
above them, but it was flickering 
slightly. Draken glanced up at it. 
“Defective, should last longer than 
that. Let’s move farther back under 
the rocks. Keep low.” 

“How did they manage to follow 
us,” said Prima when they were 
under the rock again. 

“It’s possible that Wolf or one of 
the others hung a micro-transmitter 
on one of you — or maybe me,” 

“I thought he couldn’t follow us 
in the dark.” 

“Maybe he got another Star 
Scope somewhere. Maybe he’s got 
cat’s eyes! Damn it, I don’t care 
how he did it, what we’ve got to 
worry about is that he did!” He 
glanced at his watch. “That chop- 
per will be here in fifteen minutes. 
If we can hold out that long, we 
should be OK.” 



“Draken!” The voice from below 
was amplified and echoed across the 
valley. “Draken, come down. You 
won’t be harmed.” 

“Listen,” Draken said, “that 
flare is going to go out in a few 
seconds; when it does we’re going 
to run like Hell, to the left, up and 
behind this rock we’re under. Think 
both of you can make it?” 

“Yes,” said Prima 
“Sure,” agreed Stewart. 

As he had predicted, the flare 
flickered one last time and died. 
“Now! Follow me!” They followed 
him from under the rock up a steep, 
narrow path that led to the top of 
the overhang. They were half way 
up the path when another flare ig- 
nited overhead. Bullets ricocheted 
off the rocks around them when the 
men below saw what they were try- 
ing. 

The top of the rock was steeply 
sloped and devoid of vegetation. 
Draken led them to a shallow, 
bowl-like, rain-eroded depression 
into which they jumped. A thin slit 
in the bottom of the bowl had let 
most of the rainwater out. A thin 
skin of ice cracked under their feet. 

“The only way up here is the 
way we came,” Draken said. He 
slumped back against the edge of 
the rock. “Also, if they toss any 
grenades, they’ll roll right off the 
rock.” 

“Unless they get one right in 
here with us,” said Stewart. 

“Always thinking of the bright 
side, what?” said Draken. 



TOWARD THE FULLNESS OF FATE 



151 




“Draken,” the amplified voice 
echoed, “you don’t have a chance. 
We can wait you out. Come down 
now and we’ll let you go your way. 
We want Prima. You can walk 
away, no questions.’’ 

When the voice first sounded, 
Draken switched his weapon to sin- 
gle shot and took careful aim at the 
flare overhead. Although its motion 
was intentionally erratic, it was not 
too fast, and Draken was able to hit 
its tiny roter with his second shot. 
A few seconds after the flare 
dropped from sight another took its 
place. 

He was taking aim at the new 
flare when a grenade landed less 
than two meters from their bowl. It 
clattered noisily down the steep 
rock and off the edge, exploding 
with a tunderclap that vibrated 
through the rock. 

“I felt that one,’’ said Prima. 
Draken swore softly. “That was 
a concussion grenade. If one of 
those things explodes up here it’ll 
knock us flat, even if we’re not di- 
rectly exposed to the blast.’’ 

As he finished speaking they saw 
a grenade arch overhead and all 
three threw themselves to. the bot- 
tom of their bowl. The grenade hit 
the rock, bounced into the air and 
exploded. Stewart felt a bone-jar- 
ring shock and a constriction in his 
chest and then he blacked out. 

Stewart awoke to the sound of 
gunfire. He saw Draken at the edge 
of the bowl, firing his weapon 
down the slope. Stewart’s foot was 

152 



pinned under Prima’s inert body. 
By the time he had freed it and got- 
ten his pistol out of its holster, the 
firing had stopped. 

“Stay down. Will. They’re pull- 
ing back for a while.’’ 

“Was I out long?’’ 

“A few seconds, I think. Not 
long.’’ He looked at Prima. 
“How’s he?” 

Stewart felt for a pulse; it was 
strong. “Alive.” 

“Listen!” Draken grabbed his 
arm. “Do you hear it? The chop- 
per!” 

Stewart could feel the low throb 
of the helicopter’s engines. “Where 
is it?” 

“It’s close. Must be below our 
line of sight.” 

The terrorists began to fire their 
guns again and suddenly the chop- 
per passed directly over their rock 
bowl, the rotor wash picking up ice 
slivers and spinning them madly 
through the air. 

Draken waved and saw one of the 
pilots acknowledge him. The 
helicopter’s tail twisted around until 
its nose was facing the terrorist’s 
position, then the gunner fired a 
salvo of antipersonnel rockets. 
There was a deafening explosion 
and an angry orange fireball rose 
into the sky. 

Stewart saw a figure in the chop- 
per’s open hatch. The man was 
waving and pointing toward the 
path that led to the top of the rock. 
There was a burst of gunfire from 
below and the man pitched forward 



GALAXY 




with a scream, clutching his chest. 
The chopper rose up and to the left, 
trying to get out of the range of the 
terrorist weapons. 

“I think we’re about to get it, 
Draken,” Stewart said, resting his 
pistol on the lip of the bowl. 

Three terrorists scrambled up the 
rock, firing as they came. Draken 
got off a half-dozen rounds and ran 
out of ammunition. His burst caught 
one man in the belly, and Stewart 
hit one in the thigh. The third man 
shot Draken as he was trying to re- 
load. The impact spun him around 
and knocked him against Stewart 
and part way out of their bowl. 

With uncanny speed, the remain- 
ing terrorist ran forward and kicked 
Stewart’s gun out of his hand. Ig- 
noring the blinding pain in his gun 
hand, Stewart reached forward and 
grabbed the man behind the knee. 
Off balance, with one foot still in 
the air, the man fell heavily, the lip 
of the bowl catching him in the 
middle of the back. The man 
screamed and twisted forward onto 
Stewart and then he was still, his 
back broken. 

As Stewart pushed the man off 
him, he heard sporadic gunfire be- 
yond the edge of the rock, but noth- 
ing moved on top of the rock. 

He turned Draken over and raised 
the visor of his helmet. His eyes 
were open and lifeless. The blood 
that had soaked Draken’s black jump 
suit was invisible except where 
it reflected the light of the flare. 

“God damn," Stewart said 



TOWARD THE FULLNESS OF FATE 




softly. He pushed the visor down 
and turned to Prima, who was 
struggling to sit up. 

“How long have I been out?” he 
asked. 

Stewart sat down on the rim of 
the bowl, his shoulders bent forward. 
“Less than five minutes, I’d 
guess.” 

The chopper appeared above 
them again and a man in the hatch 
waved, and then it moved off. 

“I guess they want us to get 
down off this damn rock,” said 
Prima. 

“Suits me.” He climbed out of 
the bowl and started down the rock. 

“Hey, what’s wrong with Dra- 
ken?” Prima was bending over 
Draken’s body. 

Stewart didn’t stop or answer. He 
was already halfway down the path 
when he heard Prima’s softly mut- 
tered “Oh” in his helmet receiver. 

* * * 

They sat in the same booth as be- 
fore, close to the fire place. The 
padded seats and table seemed to 
have been pulled — like warm 
taffy — right out of the wooden wall. 
Stewart followed the flowing lines 
with his eyes, thinking about the 
past three days. 

The helicopter had got them to 
Bern at dawn. Stewart ate, took a 
hot shower and went to bed. He had 
slept until about 8:30 p.m., when 
his phone rang. Prima told him he 
could get him aboard the Zurich 

154 



shuttle to the orbital station at 11:00 
p. m. if Stewart still wanted to go 
back. Stewart said yes at the word 
shuttle. Prima then invited him to 
dinner, which offer he also ac- 
cepted. 

Now, dinner over, small glasses 
of wine in front of each man, they 
sat in silence. Prima sighed and sat 
back. He looked at his watch. 

“You’ll have to leave for the air- 
port in a few minutes. I’ve got a car 
waiting.” 

“Thanks, Jeff.” He took a sip of 
wine. ‘‘When are you going to 
make your proposal to the confer- 
ence?” 

“I presented it this afternoon.” 

He looks so tired, Stewart 
thought. He looks five years older 
than he did three days ago. / won- 
der how I look? 

“What did they think of it?’’ 

“They loved it. God help us, 
they really loved it.” 

“Did they find Wolf?” 

Prima shook his head. “It doesn’t 
matter. They won’t believe him. 
There’s nothing he — or anybody — 
could say that could take their hope 
away now.” 

Stewart nodded and stood up. 
“Well ... I guess it’s time.” 

“Yes. Thanks, Will. For every- 
thing.” 

The clouds had finally cleared, 
and the night air was cool and 
fresh. Stewart paused on the curb 
and looked up at the stars. He 
sighed and climbed into the waiting 
car. ★

Dear Sir: 

The short poem you’ll find attached to this 
letter is, I believe, an appropriate expression 
of what science fiction is to those who love 
it, and could be to everyone else: 

Science Fiction 
The best and fondest 
of all our dreams 
are wrapped up in science fiction. 

It is a plea to the human race 
to seek out the infinite 
and a warning of the consequences 
if we don’t. 

It is a world of make-believe, 
or if and maybe md just suppose, 
the greatest, most enduring aspirations, 
the one last racial wishing-well 
not yet gone dry. 



Sincerely, 
Gary McKinley

As good a definition as any I've seen. 

Dear Mr. Baen; 

Re: C. Henrich’s letter on possible 
monopole UFO propulsion (Feb.). 'The grav- 
ity and inertia defying antics of UFOs cannot 
be explained except by a gravity shield. Such 
a shield would have to be generated by a 
new physical force (only four are known) 
since it would produce a gravitational field 

156 



without the addition of large masses. The 
shield would cancel inertial mass; which 
educes a classic question: Is inertial mass in- 
trinsic or due to the gravitational field of the 
universe (Mach’s Principle)? 

A recent patent (#3,626,605) claims to 
have experimentally verified such a fifth 
force. The inventor claims that if materials 
constituted of half integral spin nuclei, like 
copper, are accelerated relative to each other, 
the nuclei become increasingly polarized 
under a fifth force and that a gravitational 
field arises, which can be made to balance 
gravity and reduce inertial mass to zero. I 
imagine a craft constructed as follows: Con- 
centric copper rings at high r.p.m., the cen- 
tral ring being massive and fixed to the craft. 
The outer rings would therefore be centrifug- 
ally accelerated relative to the central ring. 

1 want somebody to explain to me what 
known force generates and perpetually sus- 
tains particle and nuclei spin, and where the 
energy source is. 

Another curious physics fact that has es- 
caped the would-be inventors of reactionless 
propulsion systems is that while Newton’s 
Third Law of action and reaction forbids 
mechanical reactionless systems, Newton’s 
law is generally invalid for electromagnetism 
and therefore electromagnetic drives. One 
example would be a charge moving perpen- 
dicular to a current-canying wire. The cur- 
rent exerts a force on the charge, but not 
vice versa! A reactionless system would be 
entirely enclosed, producing no pollution and 
noise, and would appear to lose weight. 

Cordially Yours,

OK. I can accept that gravity is not a Force 
inseparable from mass — but inertia.’ Let’s 
see some experimental verification! 

Dear Mr. Baen: 

I’m writing in support of Jerry Poumelle’s 
diatribe oh Cultures Beyond the Earth 
(Maruyama and Harkins, ed.). I’m a grad 



GALAXY 




student in physics and I usually find Dr. 
Poumelle’s article to be worth the price of 
admission by itself. In this case, since I had 
read most of the book (I quit on p. 91), he 
didn’t tell me anything I hadn’t essentially 
seen for myself, but the chance to watch a 
master dissect the amateur planet-builders 
(with one hand in his back pocket, no doubt) 
made up for it. 

I’ve been interested in anthropology for 
years, and in SF for more years, so like Dr. 
Poumelle I was pleased to see a “scholarly” 
book on exosocial science. Like Dr. Pour- 
nelle I was disappointed — and, yes, angry — 
at what is being passed off as scholarship. 
For example, Maruyama, in his introduction, 
claims that physics is inapplicable to biology 
since classical thermodynamics always im- 
plies increasing homogeneity, and cannot ex- 
plain the heterogeneity characteristic of life: 
“It simply begged the question by saying 
that a living organism is not an isolated sys- 
tem.” (p. 8). Well, if he’s talking about 
19th century thermodynamics, admitting that 
the thermodynamics of isolated systems 
doesn’t apply to life is just sensible; if he’s 
talking about the twentieth century, he’s 
flatly wrong. A man named Prigogene has 
shown rigorously that in an open system with 
energy flow (e.g. the earth), order or 
heterogeneity can increase without bound. 
His studies also indicate that the formation of 
the first life forms may have been due to the 
presence of chemical instabilities, much as 
the structure of convection cells can appear 
in an homogeneous body of water in the pre- 
sence of an unstable temperature profile. 

Some of the articles in Cultures betray not 
only an ignorance of the physical sciences 
(and perhaps a disinclination to remedy that 
ignorance), but ignorance of the social and 
biological sciences. The article on “First 
Contact” by Donald K. Stem, a sociology 
student, describes the idea of detecting ad- 
vanced technologies by their radiation of 
waste heat in the deep infrared as absurd: “It 
is a little like trying to analyze another cul- 
ture by its garbage.” (p. 41). Ask an 
archaeologist — any archaeologist — how much 
he likes garbage heaps. Concentrated mate- 



rials, quickly buried, rarely disturbed, layers 
in neat reverse chronological order. .And 
Stem’s remark (p. 45) that “(life) had been 
evolving for 3,000 million years before the 
human race appeared; birds and mammals 
took only 200 million years. ...” Just 
doesn’t bear comment. 

Beyond that, for all their talk of 
heterogeneity, the writers in Cultures are pret- 
ty homogeneous in assuming a communistic 
future society. That’s practically an article of 
faith in the social science community. Their 
chastisement of the astronomers for their 
treatment of Velikovsky sounds pretty hol- 
low when you consider the social scientists’ 
treatment of William Shockley or, for that 
matter, Robert Ardrey. 

I could go on forever, but the point is this: 
the “serious” world is still thirty years be- 
hind SF. If you want imaginative specula- 
tion. informed by an understanding of the 
hard physical, biological and social facts that 
will constrain the future, without ideological 
stereotypes, don’t look at the social scien- 
tists. Dr. Poumelle was too modest to say 
so, but The Mote in God's Eye is a better 
piece of scholarship — yes, scholarship, if 
that means the use of your brains and 
education — than Cultures Beyond the Earth. 
Larry Niven has written numerous stories on 
the social effects of organ banks, teleporta- 
tion etc. that are worth more thought than 
this whole book. 

That’s why I read Galaxy instead of 
Human Behavior.

Mr. Baen, 

Would you ask Jerry Poumelle to write 
(sometime) a science fact article on the big 
bang theory? I’ve heard it banged around 
occasionally but I still know relatively little 
about h. 

If he has no tendencies toward writing 
about this, could you refer me to some other 
source I could correspond with to answer a 
few of my questions? Please. — Thank you.

DIRECTIONS 




By the way — 

Questions: 

1. Big Bang! Eveiy thing moving away 
from source, and consequently every 
thing else, at tremendous rates of 
speed. Would this have effects on 
space travel? 

2. Solar system sailing along through 
galaxy which sails glibly through 
universe. Is our galaxy eventually 
going to disperse? Or will it kinda 
hang together like planets in solar 
system? 

3. Would it not be splendid (if we cared 
to go in that particular direction) to 
merely step off one sailing thing-a- 
majig and hold still until the next one 
comes flying by? 

If feel I am quite tangled in my screwy 
information. Could you please straighten me 
out? 

Yours respectually, 
Sharon L. Bannon

Jerry was kind enough to reply at some 
length: 

Dear Ms. Bannon, 

Jim Baen has forwarded your letter to me. 

I may one day write a column on the Big 
Bang; tell you what, when we get a few 
more letters requesting it, maybe I’ll do it. 
The problem is that many readers already 
know or think they do, and there’s a lot of 
material in print on the subject; I try to keep 
the colunm consistent with the title and deal 
with new stuff. I need an angle that hasn’t 
been used. 

Answering your specific questions: 

What’s receding is galaxies; thus the 
relative motions involved won’t have much 
effect on space travel until we try to go to a 
different galaxy; and since there’s about 100 
billion stars in ours, it may take a while 
before we care to leave it! 

Our galaxy isn’t going to disperse. One 
supposed that over a long enough period of 
itime the stars will slow down, due to 
interstellar gup like dust, and the galaxy will 

158 



all compact together. This happens in 
something like a billion billion years, so not 
to worry; long before then, if the 
cosmologists are right, the receding galaxies 
will themselves have come to a halt and 
begin coming back together for another 
compacting and another Big Bang. There are 
problems with that theory, so if you don’t 
care for it, you needn’t accept it; but indeed 
our galaxy will hang together for precisely 
the same reason that the solar system hangs 
together. 

Stepping off an object in space will not 
bring you to a halt; you will retain the same 
velocity. It is as if you jumped off an 
asteroid (there are many smaU enough so that 
you could jump off them) — you would still 
be travelling in approximately the same orbit 
as the asteroid, and have about the same 
velocity (well, speed, actually) relative to the 
Sun. 

In science, as in fiction by a good author, 
the general rule is: "when in perplexity, read 
on!” We may not get all the answers, but 
we’ll have a lot of them if you look for 
them. 

Thank you for writing. 

Sincerely, 
Jerry Poumelle 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

First time loccer and all that. .1 started 
with Galaxy and then If three years ago, and 
have since watched you build them up into 
the best prozines on the market. You’ll 
notice that I still speak of If in the present 
tense. I’m confident you’ll find a way to re- 
vive it — we need the market. 

Looking thru the Jan. issue. .That Cov- 
er!!! There must be some way that you could 
reprint that, say 2' x 3' on light poster stock 
gloss for around five dollars. At least some- 
thing without the logo &c Stembach is easily 
the best spaceship artist (how’s that for a sub- 
genre?) ever. 

As to the “free art” inside the cover — how 
about alternating established artists with 
those new to the field? Until // comes back, 
anyway. 

Your graphics altogether have improved 
indescribably in the last year. Using a sort of 



GALAXY 




Hyleaf on your main feature is an excellent 
idea. 

The science column was excellent. 
Perhaps you could have a Niven/Poumelle 
team article about one out of four issues. It 
could be used for articles about more sf-ish 
concepts; space drives, things like Bigger 
Than Worlds that Niven had in Analog some 
time back. 

Back with the art — please give the full name 
of every artist on the page where his drawing 
appears. You wouldn't print the story with- 
out the author’s name, would you? 

I enjoy Spider’s column — no criticism, just 
a friendly chat with somebody that read the 
book. Why waste $1 .50? By the way, he did 
miss mention of the awards given Queen of 
Air & Darkness, but 1 won’t tell anybody. 

I’m not going to pass judgement on “We 
■Who Are About To. .’’ until I read the 
second half. So far, the writing is great but

the story revolts me. 

I enjoyed all of the shorts, especially 
O’Donnell’s and Robinson’s. And 1 miss the 
editorial. C’mon, friend, you must have 
something worth saying. 

I also cast a vote for few serials. Few 
novels can stand the strain of serialization. 
They resemble the differences between made 
for TV movies where the commercial breaks 
are an integral part of the suspense, and 
normal films where the breaks merely dis- 
tract and destroy continuity. 

I close with hope for your future (con- 
tinued) success. Just keep up that sense of 
the editor’s presence, and I’ll keep buying.
