Out of the Idiot Box 



T his month's Hue & Cry , you'll 
note, contains some discussion 
about the parlous state of science 
fiction on television. What we’ve 
printed is only the visible tip of 
the iceberg:; we've had a lot of mail 
on the subject. Generally speaking, 
the letters have run along these 
lines: (1) Science fiction on TV 
was pretty awful, but (2) pretty 
awful science fiction is better than 
no science fiction at all, so we wish 
we could get it back. 

There is a reason video sf has 
been — well — not as good as it 
could be, let's say politely. The 
reason is not that everyone con- 
nected with television on the pro- 
ducing and packaging end is an ill- 
tempered halfwit; nor is it that 
Hollywood has never heard of 
science fiction; nor is it that the 
medium is simply unable to handle 
science-fiction ideas. A few months 
ago we spent some time in Holly- 
wood talking with a number of 
producers, network representatives, 
writers and even actors about 
science-fiction-on-TV. A great many 
of them turned out to have a pretty 
good understanding of science fic- 
tion, which may not be so surpris- 
ing, at that — after all, they have 
the likes of Bob Bloch, Ray Brad- 
bury, Harlan Ellison, Robert Sheck- 
ley, Jerome Bixby and a good many 
others right there working in their 
own vineyards to advise them. And 
just the other day we spent a pleas- 
urable afternoon with a representa- 
tive of the British Broadcasting 
Corporation, going over plans for 
the BBC's new weekly 75-minute 



science-fiction show, which will be 
on the air shortly. 

For from where we sit, we have 
come to the conclusion that what’s 
wrong with American science-fic- 
tion television is what's wrong with 
American television in general: It 
is the fault of the networks' com- 
petitive striving for ratings. When 
the pundits of Gloppy Broadcasting 
System sit down to contemplate the 
merits of a projected science-fiction 
program, they don't merely wonder 
whether or not it will be any good. 
Or even whether it will attract a 
wide audience. Or even whether it 
will do better than the rival pro- 
grams. 

Where they get into trouble U 
when they start to ask themselves 
where it fits into their strategic 
pattern, capitalizing on the audience 
from the show before and building 
a lazy, non-dial-switching audience 
for the show that follows. 

Listeners don't have much to say 
about it. Not even sponsors have 
much to say about it. And it is 
reaching a point where the network 
executives themselves don't have 
much to say about it. 

B ut there's hope! We do think 
that a few more years may show 
us a brighter prospect; for by then 
the UHF stations should be on the 
air in numbers enough, and with 
organization enough, to give us all 
variety and quality. 

And then we might get some truly 
first-rate programs in many areas 
— science fiction included!

THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man's mind, and the 
mastery of life's problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

Part One 



THE SKYLARKS — 



When Doctor Richard Ballinger 
Seaton liberated the intra-atomic 
energy of matter he started some- 
thing that he was completely unable 
to handle. 

If the situation and condition 
could have been confined to Earth 
things would have been bad enough, 
what with Doctor Marc C. Du- 
Quesne and the World Steel Cor- 
poration and other rapacious persons 
and organizations murderously de- 
termined to monopolize this tremen- 
dous new source of power, but it 
was not and could not be so con- 
fined. Seaton and M. Reynolds 
Crane, the multi-millionaire inven- 
tor-scientist-explorer, built a small, 
crude spaceship; which Dorothy 
Vaneman, Seaton’s fiancee, chris- 
tened the Skylark. 

DuQuesne and the World Steel 
Corporation promptly duplicated this 
vessel and took to space to try to 
do away with Seaton and Crane and 
all others who could block the Cor- 
poration’s attainment of monopoly. 
And both Seaton and DuQuesne, 
each in a succession of ever-larger 
and ever-better spaceships, visited 
world after populated world. 

They encountered many and 
varied civilizations — monstrous, 
non-human, humanoid, near-human 
and strictly human civilizations. 
Some of these races were less intelli- 
gent than the humanity of Earth. 
Some were very much like us. Some 
— particularly the ancient, green- 
skinned Norlammians of the incredi- 



bly copper-rich Green or Central 
System — possessed vastly greater 
knowledge. 

DuQuesne learned, but did not 
teach; took, but did not give. He 
was out for Marc C. DuQuesne first, 
last, and all times in between his 
tremendous ability was concentrated 
upon getting, by the use of any pos- 
sible mean whatever, a monopoly 
of the extremely rare metal rovolon 
— the key to intra-atomic energy. 

Seaton and Crane, on the other 
hand, were equally single-mindedly 
determined that Seaton’s discovery 
should be devoted to the good of all 
humanity wherever situate, and to 
that of all civilizations compatible 
with humanity. 

The Tellurians encountered a 
group of immaterial, disembodied 
minds: extremely intelligent and ex- 
traordinarily powerful patterns of 
pure sixth-order force. DuQuesne 
joined them; and the problem thus 
posed was a tremendous one indeed. 
Seaton solved it, however, by en- 
capsulating the whole group of “pure 
intellectuals” in a stasis of time and 
launching the capsule on a voyage 
that should endure throughout al- 
most aU of total time and reach al- 
most the farthermost limit of space. 

Having removed the greatest ob- 
stacle to progress, the Seaton-Crane 
party returned to Earth’s solar sys- 
tem in their space-flying worldlet the 
Skylark of Valeron and began to 
bring order out of the chaos that all 
Earth then was.

SKYLARK 

DuQUESNE 



by E. E. SMITH, Ph.D. 

Illustrated by MORROW 



Here's the grand conclusion of 
science fiction's greatest series 
— Seaton and DuQuesne against 
a galaxy of unconquerable foes/ 



I 

s. o. s. 

A ppearances are deceiving. A 
polished chunk of metal that 
shines like a Christmas-tree orna- 
ment may hold — and release — 
energy to destroy a city. A seed is 



quite another order of being to the 
murderous majesty of a toppling 
tree. A match flame can become a 
holocaust. 

And the chain of events that can 
unseat the rulers of galaxies can be- 
gin in a cozy living room, before a 
hearth. 

Outwardly, the comfortable (if 



f 



•omewhat splendidly furnished) liv- 
ing room of the home of the Rich- 
ard Ballinger Seatons of Earth pre- 
sented a peaceful scene. Peaceful? 
It was sheerly pastoral! Seaton and 
Dorothy, his spectacularly auburn- 
haired wife, sat on a davenport, hold- 
ing hands. A fire of pine logs 
burned slowly, crackling occasion- 
ally and sending sparks against the 
fine brcnze screen of the fireplace. 
Richard Ballinger Seaton Junior lay 
on the rug, trying doggedly, silently, 
and manfully, if unsuccessfully, to 
wriggle toward those entrancing 
flames. 

Inwardly, however, R was very 
much otherwise. Dorothy’s normal- 
ly pleasant — as well as beautiful — 
face wore a veritable scowl. 

The dinner they had just eaten 
had been over two hours late; where- 
fore not one single item of it had 
been fit to feed to a pig. Further- 
more, and worse, Dick was not re- 
laxed and was not paying any atten- 
tion to her at all. He was still wound 
up tight; was adll concentrating on 
the multitude of messages driving 
into his brain through the button in 
his left ear — messages of such 
urgency of drive that she herself 
could actually read them, even 
though she was wearing no appara- 
tus whatever. 

She reached up* twitched the but- 
ton out of his ear, and tossed it on- 
to a table. “Will you please lay off 
of that stuff for a minute, Dick?” 
ahe demanded. *Tm fed up to the 
eyeballs with this business of you 
killing yourself with all time work 
and no time sleep. You never had 
any such horrible black circles under 

• 



your eyes before and you’re getting 
positively scrawny. You’ve got to 
quit it. Can’t you let somebody else 
carry some of the load? Delegate 
some authority?” 

“I’m delegating all I possibly can 
already, Red-Top.” Seaton absently 
rubbed his ear. Until Dorothy had 
flipped it away, the button had been 
carrying to him a transcription of 
the taped reports of more than one 
hundred Planetary Observers from 
the planet of Norlamin, each with 
the I. Q. of an Einstein and the 
sagacity of an owl. The last report 
had had to do with plentiful supplies 
of X metal that had been turned up 
on a planet of Omicron Eridani, and 
the decision to dispatch a fleet of 
cargo-carrying ships to fetch them 
away. 

But he admitted grudgingly to 
himself that that particular decision 
had already been made. His wife 
was a nearer problem. Paying full 
attention to her now, he put his arm 
around her and squeezed. 

“Converting a whole planet practi- 
cally all at once to use fourth-, fifth-, 
and sixth-order stuff is a job of 
word, believe me. It’s all so new and 
so tough that not too many people 
can handle any part of it. It takes 
brains. And what makes it extra 
tough is that altogether too many 
people who are smart enough to 
learn it are crooks. Shysters — 
hoodlers — sticky-fingers generally. 
But I think we’re just about over the 
hump. I wouldn’t wonder if these 
Norlaminian ‘Observers’ — snoopers, 
really — from the Country of Youth 
will turn out to be the answer to 
prayer.”

“They’d better,” she said, darkly. 
“At least, something had better.” 
“Besides, if you think 1 look like 
the wrath of God, take a good look 
at Mart sometime. He’s having more 
grief than I am.” 

“1 already have; he looks like a 
refugee from a concentration camp. 
Peggy was screaming about it this 
morning, and we’re both going to 
just simply. 

7^hat the girls intended to do 
was not revealed, for at that 
moment there appeared in the air 
before them the projected simulacra 
of eight green-skinned, more-or-less- 
human men; the men with whom 
they had worked so long; the ablest 
thinkers of the Central System. 

There was majestic Fodan, the 
Chief of the Five of Norlamin; 
there was white-bearded Orion, the 
First of Astronomy; Rovol, the First 
of Rays; Astron, the First of Energy; 
Drasnik, the First of Psychology; 
Satrazon and Caslor, the Firsts of 
Chemistry and of Mechanism, re- 
spectively; and — in some ways not 
the least — there was that powerhouse 
of thought, Sacner Carfon the two 
thousand three hundred forty-sixth: 
the hairless, almost porpoise-like 
Chief of the Council of the watery 
planet Dasor. They were not present 
in the flesh. But their energy projec- 
tions were as seemingly solid as Sea- 
ton’s own tall, lean body. 

“We come, Overlord of the Sys- 
tem, upon a matter of — ” the Chief 
of the Five began. 

“Don’t call me ‘Overlord*. 
PWs-.” Seaton broke in, with grim 
foreboding in his eye®, while Dorothy 

y 0 



stiffened rigidly in the circle of his 
arms. Both knew that those masters 
of thought could scarcely be pre- 
vailed upon to leave their own 
worlds even via projection. For all 
eight of them to come this far — al- 
most halfway across the galaxy! — 
meant that something was very 
wrong indeed. 

“I’ve told you a dozen times, not 
only I ain’t no Overlord but I don’t 
want to be and won’t be. I don’t like 
to play God — I simply have not got 
what it takes.” 

“ ‘Coordinator’, then, which is of 
course a far better term for all ex- 
cept the more primitive races,” Fo- 
dan went imperturbably on. “We 
have told you, youth, not a dozen 
times, but once, which should have 
been sufficient, that your young and 
vigorous race possesses qualities that 
our immensely older peoples po 
longer have. You, as the ablest indi- 
vidual of your race, are uniquely 
qualified to serve total civilization* 
Thus, whenever your services be- 
come necessary, you will so serve. 
Your services have again become 
necessary. Orion, in whose province 
the matter primarily lies, will ex- 
plain.” 

Seaton nodded to himself. It was 
going to be bad, all right, he thought 
as the First of Astronomy took over. 

“You, friend Richard, with some 
help from us, succeeded in encap- 
sulating a group of malignant im- 
material entities, including the dis- 
embodied personality of your fellow- 
scientist Doctor Marc C. DuQuesne, 
in a stasis of time. This capsule, 
within which no time whatever 
could or can elapse, was launched 

IF 





into space with a linear acceleration 
of approximately three times ten to 
the twelfth centimeters per second 
squared. It was designed and power- 
ed to travel at that acceleration for 
•omething over one hundred thou- 
sand million Tellurian years; at the 
end of which time it was to have 
been rotated through the fourth 
dimension into an unknown and un- 
knowable location in normal three- 
dimensional space.” 

“That’s right,” Seaton said. “And 
k will. It’ll do just exactly that. Those 
pure-intellectual louses are gone for 
pood; and so is Blackie DuQuesne.” 
“You err, youth,” corrected the 
Norlaminian. “You did not allow us 
time sufficient to consider and to 
evaluate all the many factors in- 
volved. Rigid analysis and extended 
computation show that the probabil- 
ity approaches unity that the cap- 
sule of stasis will, almost certainly 
within one Tellurian year of its 
launching and highly probably in 
much less time, encounter celestial 
matter of sufficient density to volati- 
lize its uranium power bars. This 
event will of course allow the stasis 
of time to collapse and the impri- 
soned immaterial entities will be 
liberated; in precisely the same condi- 
tion as in the instant of -their en- 
capsulation.” 

D orothy Seaton gasped. Even her 
husband showed that he was 
riiaken. DuQuesne and the Immor- 
tals free? But— 

“But it can’t!” he fairly yelled the 
protest “It’ll dodge — it’s built to 
dodge anything that dense!” 

“At ordinary — or even extraordi- 



nary — velocities, yes,” the ancient 
sage agreed, unmoved. “Its speed of 
reaction is great, yes; a rather small 
fraction of a trillionth of a second. 
That interval of time, however, while 
small, is very large indeed relative 
to zero. Compute for yourself, 
please, what distance that capsule 
will in theory traverse during that 
space of time at the end of only one 
third of one of your years.” 

Seaton strode across the room and 
uncovered a machine that resembled 
somewhat a small, unpretentious 
desk calculator.* He picked up a 
helmet and thought into it briefly; 
then stared appalled at the figure 
that appeared on a tape. 

“My — aunt’s — cat’s — kittens’ 
— pants — buttons,” he said, slow- 
ly. “It’d’ve been smarter, maybe, 
to’ve put ’em in orbit around a 
planetless sun. And I don’t 
suppose there’s a Chinaman’s chance 
of catching ’em again that same 
way.” 

“No. Those minds are competent,” 
agreed the Norlaminian. “Only one 
point is clear. You must again acti- 
vate the Skylark of Valeron and 
again wear its sixth-order controller, 
since we know of no other entity 
who either can wear it or should. 
We eight are here to confer and, 
on the basis of the few data now 
available, to plan.” 



Dorothy Seaton was highly averse t# 
having the appearance of her living room 
ruined by office equipment. Seaton, how- 
ever, was living and working under such 
high tension that he had to have almost 
instant access to the ValeroiTs Brain, at 
any time of the day or night or wherever 
he might be. Hence this compromise — 
Inconspicuous machines, each direct-con- 
nected to the cubic mile of ultra-minia- 
turization that was the Brain. E. E. S. 



SKYLARK DUQUESNV

Seaton scowled in concentration 
for two long minutes. 

It was a measure of the strain that 
had been working on him that it took 
that long. As he had said, he was no 
God, and didn’t want to be. He had 
not gone looking for either conquest 
or glory. One thing at a time . but 
that “one thing” had successively 
led him across a galaxy, into another 
dimension, through many a hard and 
desperate fight against some of the 
most keen-honed killers of a uni- 
verse. 

His gray eyes hardened. Of all 
those killers, it was Blackie Du- 
Quesne who posed the greatest threat 
— to civilization, to Seaton himself, 
and above all to his wife, Dorothy. 
DuQuesne at large was deadly. 

“All right,” he snapped at last. 
“If that’s all that’s in the wood, I 
suppose that’s the way it’ll have to 
be carved.” 

The Norlaminian merely nodded. 
He, at least, had had no doubts of 
how Seaton would react to the chal- 
lenge. Typically, once Seaton had 
decided speed became of the essence. 
“We’ll start moving now,” he barked. 
“The parameters give us up to a 
year — maybe — but from this minute 
we act as though DuQuesne and the 
Intellectuals are back in circulation 
right now . So if one erf you — Rovd? 
— will put beams on Mari and Peg 
and project them over here, we*H 
get right at it” 

And Dorothy, her face turning so 
white that a line of freckles stood 
boldly out across the bridge of her 
nose, picked the baby up and clasped 
him fiercely, protectively to her 
breast. 



M Reynolds (“Martin" or 
“Mart”) Crane was tall, 
slender, imperturbable; his black- 
haired, ivory-skinned wife Margaret 
was tall and whistle stacked — she 
and Dorothy were just about of a 
size and a shape. In a second or two 
their full working projections appear- 
ed, standing in the middle of the 
room facing the Seatons — projec- 
tions so exactly true to life and so 
solid-seeming as to give no indication 
whatever that they were not com- 
posed of fabric and of flesh and 
bone and blood. 

Seaton stood up and half-bowed to 
Margaret, but wasted no time in 
getting down to business. “Hi, Peg 
— Mart. He briefed you?” 

“Up to the moment, yes,” Crane 
replied. 

“You know, then, that some time 
in the indeterminate but not too dis- 
tant future all hell is going to be 
out for noon. Any way I scan it, h 
looks to me as though, more or 
less shortly, we’re going to be 
spurlos versenkt — sunk without a 
trace.” 

“You err, youth.” Drasnik, the 
First of Psychology of Norlamin, 
spoke quite sharply, for him. “Your 
thinking is loose, turbid, confused; 
inexcusably superficial; complete- 
ly . ” 

“But you know what their top 
man said!” Seaton snapped. “The 
one they called 'One’ — and he 
wasn’t kidding, either, believe me!” 
“I do, youth. I know more than 
that, since they visited us long since. 
They were not exactly ‘kidding* you, 
perhaps, but your several various in- 
terpretations of One’s actual words 



12 



IP 




nod actions were inconsistent with 
any and every aspect of the truth. 
Those words and actions were in all 
probability designed to elicit such 
responses and reactions as would 
enable him to analyze and classify 
your race. Having done so, the 
probability approaches unity that you 
will not again encounter him or any 
of his group.” 

“My — God!” Dorothy, drawing 
a tremendously deep breath, put 
Dick the Small back down on the 
rug and left him to his own devices. 
“That makes sense ... I was scared 
simply witless.” 

“Maybe,” Seaton admitted, “as 
far as One and the rest of his orig- 
inal gang are concerned. But there’s 
still DuQuesne. And if Blackie Du- 
Quesne, even as an immaterial pat- 
tern of pure sixth-order force, thinks 
that way about me I’m a Digger 
Indian.” 

“Ah, yes; DuQuesne. One ques- 
tion, please, to clarify my thinking. 
Can you, do you think, even with 
the fullest use of all the resources 
of your Skylark of Valeron, release 
the intact mind from any body?” 

“Of course I . oh, I see what 
you mean. Just a minute; I think 
probably I can find out from here.” 
He went over to his calculator-like 
instrument, put on a helmet, and 
stood motionless for a couple of 
minutes while the great brain of 
the machine made its computations. 
Then, wearing a sheepish grin: 

“A flat bust. I not only couldn’t, 
I didn’t,” he reported, cheerfully. 
“So One not only did the business, 
but he was good enough to make me 
know that I was doing it. What an 



operator!” He sobered, thought in- 
tensely, then went on, “So they 
sucked us in. Played with us.” 

“You are now beginning to think 
clearly, youth,” Drasnik said. “We 
come now, then, to lesser probabili- 
ties. DuQuesne’s mind, of itself, is a 
mind of power.” 

“You can broadcast that to the all- 
attentive universe,” Seaton said. 
“Question: how much stuff has he 
got now? We know he’s got the fifth 
order down solid. Incarnate, he 
didn’t know any more than that 
However, mind is a pattern of sixth- 
order force. Knowing what we went 
through to get the sixth, and that 
we haven’t got it all yet by seven 
thousand rows of Christmas trees, 
the first sub-question asks itself: Can 
a free mind analyze itself completely 
enough to work out and to handle 
the entire order of force in which 
it lies? 

“We may assume, I think, that 
One could have given DuQuesne full 
knowledge of the sixth if he felt 
like it. The second sub-question, 
then, is; did he? If those questions 
aren’t enough to start with I can 
think of plenty more.” 

“They are enough, youth,” Fodan 
said. “You have pointed out the 
crux. We will now discuss the mat- 
ter. Since this first phase lies largely 
in your province, Drasnik, you wfll 
now take over.” 

^T^he discussion mounted, and 
A grew, and went on and on. 
Silently Dorothy slipped away, and 
the projection of force that was 
Margaret Crane followed her into 
the kitchen.

There was no need for Dorothy 
to prepare coffee and sandwiches 
for her husband, not by hand; one 
thought into a controller would have 
produced any desired amount of 
any desired comestibles. But she 
wanted something to do. Both girls 
knew from experience that a con- 
ference of this sort might go on for 
hours; and Dorothy knew that with 
food placed before him, Seaton 
would eat; without it, he would never 
notice the lack. 

She did not, of course, prepare 
anything for the others. 

They were not there. Their bodies 
were at varying distances — a few 
miles for Crane and his wife, an 
unthinkable number of parsecs for 
the Norlaminians and Sacner Car- 
fon. The distance between Earth and 
the Green System was so unthink- 
ably vast that there was no point 
in trying to express it in numbers of 
miles, or even parsecs. The central 
green sun of the cluster that held 
Norlamin, Osnome and Dasor was 
visible from Earth, all right — in 
Earth’s hugest optical telescopes, as 
a tiny, 20th-magnitude point — but 
the light that reached Earth had 
been on its way for tens of thousand 
of years before Seaton’s ancestors 
had turned from hunting to agricul- 
ture, had taken off their crude skins 
and begun to build houses, cities, 
machines and, ultimately, spaceships. 

To all of this Dorothy and Peggy 
Crane were no strangers; they had 
been themselves in such projections 
countless times. If they were more 
than usually silent, it was not be- 
cause of the astonishing quality of 
the meeting that was taking place 



in the Seatons' living room, but be- 
cause of die subject of that meet- 
ing. Both Dorothy and Peg knew 
Marc DuQuesne well. Both of them 
had experienced his cold, impersonal 
deadliness. 

Neither wanted to come close to 
it again. 

Back in the living room, Seaton 
was saying: “If One gave DuQuesne 
all of the sixth-order force patterns, 
he can be anywhere and can do 
practically anything. So he probably 
didn’t. On the other hand if One 
didn’t give him any of it DuQuesne 
couldn’t get back here in forty life- 
times. So he probably gave him some 
of it. The drive and the projector, 
at least. Maybe as much as we have, 
to equalize us. Maybe One figured 
he owed the ape that much. What- 
ever the truth may be, we’ve got to 
assume that DuQuesne knows as 
much as we do about sixth-order 
forces.” He paused, then corrected 
himself. “If we’re smart we'll assume 
that he knows more than we do. So 
we’ll have to find somebody else 
who knows more than we do to learn 
from. Question — how do we go 
about doing that? Not by just wan- 
dering around the galaxy at random, 
looking; that’s one certain damn sure 
thing.” 

“It is indeed,” the moderator 
agreed. “Sacner Carfon, you have, I 
think, a contribution to make at this 
point?” 

“I have?” The Dasorian was sur- 
prised at first, but caught on quick- 
ly. “Oh — perhaps I have, at that

Seaton whistled through his 
teeth. “Wow! And just how are 
you going to damp on such controls 
as those! I don’t see how anything 
but magic — sheer, unadulterated, 
pure black magic! — could swing 
that load.” 

“Precisely. Or, rather, imprecise- 
ly. It is unfortunate that your term 
‘magic’ is so inexcusably loose and 
carries so many and so deplorable 
connotations and implications. Shall 
we design and build the thought we 
wish to send out?” 

T he thought was designed and 
was built; and was launched 
into space with the inconceivable, 
the utterly immeasurable velocity of 
its order of being. 

A red-haired stripper called 
Madlyn Mannis, strutting her stuff 
in Tampa in Peninsula Florida, felt 
it and almost got it; but, not being 
very strongly psychic, shrugged it 
off and went on about the business 
of removing the last sequin-bedecked 
trifle of her costume. And, as close 
to the dancer as plenteous baksheesh 
could arrange for, a husky, good- 
looking young petrochemical engin- 
eer named Charles K. van der Gleiss 
felt a thrill like nothing he had ever 
felt before — but ascribed it, na- 
turally enough, to the fact that this 
was the first time he had ever 
seen Madlyn Mannis dance. And in 
Washington, D. C. one Doctor 
Stephanie de Marigny, a nuclear 
physicist, pricked up her ears, 
tightened the muscles of her scalp, 
and tried for two full minutes to 
think of something she ought to 
think of but couldn’t 



Out past the Green System the 
message sped, and past the dust and 
the incandescent gas that had once 
been the noisome planet of the 
Fenachrone. Past worlds where 
amphibians roared and bellowed; 
past planets of methane ice where 
crystalline life brooded sluggishly on 
its destiny. 

In the same infinitesimal instant 
it reached and passed the Rim 
Worlds of our galaxy; touching many 
minds but really affecting none. 
Farther and farther out, with no de- 
crease whatever in speed, it flew; 
past the inconceivably tiny, incon- 
ceivably fast-moving point that 
housed the seven greatest, most fear- 
some minds that the Macrocosmic 
All had ever spawned — minds that, 
knowing all about that thought al- 
ready, ignored it completely. 

Immensely farther out, it flashed 
through the galaxy in which was 
the solar system of Ray-See-Nee — 
where, for the first time, it made 
solid contact with a mind in a body 
human to the limit of classification. 
Kay-Lee Barlo, confidential secretary 
of Department Head Bay-Lay Boyn, 
stiffened so suddenly that she stut- 
tered into her microphone and had 
to erase three words from a tape 
— and in that same instant her 
mother at home went into deep 
trance. 

And still farther out, in a galaxy 
lying almost on the universe’s 
Arbitrary Rim, in the Realm of the 
Lhirdi, the message found a much 
larger group of receivers. While 
none of the practically enslaved Jelmi 
could do much of anything about 
that weirdly peculiar and inexplicab-

ly guarded thought, many of them 
were very much interested in it; 
particularly Valkyrie-like Sennloy, a 
native of the planet Allondax and 
the master biologist of all known 
space; ancient Tammon, the great- 
est genius of the entire Jelman race; 
and newlyweds Mergon and Luloy, 
the Mallidaxian savants. 

None of the monstrous Llurdi — 
not even their most monstrous “di- 
rector”, Klazmon the Fifteenth — 
being monstrous — could receive 
the message in any part. And how 
well that was! For if those tremen- 
dously able aliens could have re- 
ceived that message, could have un- 
derstood it and acted upon it, how 
vastly different the history of all 
humanity would have been! 

II 

Llurdi and Jelmi 

T he distance from Earth to the 
Realm of the Llurdi is such 
that it is worth while to take a mo- 
ment to locate it in space. 

It has been known for a long 
time that solar systems occur in 
lenticular aggregations called galax- 
ies; each galaxy consisting of one or 
more thousands of millions of solar 
systems. And for almost as long a 
time, since no definite or systematic 
arrangement of the galaxies could be 
demonstrated, the terms “Universe” 
and “Cosmic All” were interchange- 
able; each meaning the absolute 
totality of all matter and all space 
in existence anywhere and every- 
where. 

There had been speculations, of 



course, that galaxies were arranged ia 
lenticular universes incomprehensibly 
vast in size, so that the term “Co*- 
mic All” should be reserved for a 
plurality of universes and a hyper- 
space of more than three spatial 
dimensions. 

Seaton and Crane in the Skylark 
of Valeron proved that our galaxy, 
the Milky Way, lies In a lenticular 
universe by charting every galaxy 
in that universe. And they suggested 
to the various learned societies that 
the two celestial aggregates should 
be named, respectively, the Firs* 
Galaxy and the First Universe. 

Many millions of parsecs distant 
from Tellus and its First Galaxy, 
then, out near the Arbitrary Rim 
of the First Universe, there lay the 
Realm of the Llurdi. This Realm, 
which had existed for over seventy 
thousand Tellurian years, was made 
up of four hundred eighty-two 
planets in exactly half that many 
solar systems. 

Two planets in each populated sys- 
tem were necessary because the 
population of the Realm was com- 
posed of two entirely different forms 
of highly intelligent life. Of these 
two races the Jelmi — the subject 
race, living practically in vassalage 

— were strictly human beings and 
lived on strictly Tellus-Type worlds. 

The master race, the Llurdi, had 
originated upon the harsh and hostile 
planet Llurdiax — Llurdiaxorb Five 

— with its distant, wan, almost- 
never-seen sun and its incessant gales 
of frigid, ice-laden, ammonia- and 
methane-impregnated, forty-pounds- 
to-the-square-inoh air. Like mankind, 
they wore clothing against the rigors 



SKYLARK DUQUESNE 



17 




of their environment. Unlike man- 
kind, however, they wore clothes 
only for protection, and only when 
protection was actually necessary. 
Nor was Llurdiax harsh or forbid- 
ding — to them. 

It was the best of all possible 
worlds. They would not colonize any 
planet that was not as nearly as 
possible like the mother world of 
their race. 

Llurdi, although they are erect, 
bifurcate, bi-laterally symmetrical, 
bi-sexual, mammalian, and have a 
large crania and six-digited hands 
each having two opposed thumbs, 
are not humanoids. Nor, despite 
their tremendous, insensitive, un- 
freezable wings, are they either birds 
or bats. Nor flying cats, although 
they have huge, vertically-slitted eyes 
and needle-sharp canine teeth that 
protrude well below and above their 
upper and lower lips. Also, they 
have immensely strong and highly 
versatile tails; but there is nothing 
simian about them or in their an- 
cestry. 

The Realm was not exactly an 
empire. Nor was Llanzlan Klazmon 
the Fifteenth exactly an emperor. 
The title “Llanzlan” translates, as 
nearly as possible, into “Director”; 
and that was what Klazmon regarded 
himself as being. 

It is true that what he said, went; 
and that if he didn't like any existing 
law he expunged it from all exis- 
tence. But that was exactly the way 
tilings should be. How else could 
optimum conditions be achieved and 
maintained in an ever-expanding, 
ever-changing, ever-rising economy? 
He ruled, he said and thoroughly 



believed, with complete reason and 
perfect fairness and strictly in ac- 
cordance with the findings of the 
universe’s largest and most compe- 
tent computers as to what was for 
the best good of all. 

Wherefore everyone who did not 
agree with him was — automatically, 
obviously, and unquestionably — 
wrong. 

Llurdias, the capital city of the 
world Llurdiax and of the Realm, 
had a population of* just over ten 
million and covered more than nine 
hundred square miles of ground. At 
its geometrical center towered the 
mile-square, half-mile-high office- 
residence-palace (the Llurdan word 
“llanzlanate” has no Tellurian 
equivalent) of Llanzlan Klazmon 
the Fifteenth of the Realm of the 
Llurdi. And in that building’s fifth 
sub-basement, in Hall Prime of Com- 
putation, Klazmon and his Board 
of Advisors were hard at work. 

T hat vast room, the first receptor 
of all the reports of the Realm, 
was three-quarters full of receivers, 
recorders, analyzers — bewildering- 
ly complex instrumentation of all 
kinds. From most of these devices 
tapes were issuing — tapes that, en 
route to semi-permanent storage, 
were being monitored by specialists 
in the hundreds of different fields 
of the Llurdan-Jelmi economy. 

Klazmon the Fifteenth and his 
Board, seated at a long conference 
table in hard-upholstered “chairs” 
shaped to fit the Llurdan anatomy, 
were paying no attention to routine 
affairs. 

“I have called this meeting,” the 

IP

ruler said, “to decide what oan be 
done to alleviate an intolerable situ- 
ation. As you all know, we live in 
what could be called symbiosis with 
the Jelmi; who are so unstable, so 
illogical, so bird-brained generally 
that they would destroy themselves 
in a century were it not for our 
gentle but firm insistence that they 
conduct themselves in all matters 
for their own best good. This very 
instability of their illogical minds, 
however, enables them to arrive oc- 
casionally at valid conclusions from 
insufficient data; a thing that no 
logical mind can do. These conclu- 
sions — they are intuitions, really 
— account for practically all the ad- 
vancement we Llurdi have made and 
explain why we have put up with 
the Jelmi — yes, cherished them — 
so long.” 

He paused, contemplating the 
justice of the arrangement he had 
just described. It did not occur to 
him that it could in anyway be de- 
scribed as “wrong.” 

He went on: “What most of you 
do not know is that intuitions of any 
large worth have become less and 
less frequent, decade by decade, 
over the last few centuries. It was 
twelve years ago that the Jelm Jarxon 
elucidated the ‘Jarxon’ band of the 
sixth order, and no worth-while in- 
tuition has been achieved since that 
time. Beeloy, has your more rigorous 
analysis revealed any new fact of in- 
terest?” 

A young female stood up, preened 
the short fur back of her left ear 
with the tip of her tail, and said, 
“No, sir. Logic can not be applied 
to illogic. Statistical analysis is still 



the only possible tool and it cannot 
be made to apply to the point in 
question, since it is incapable of 
certainty and since the genius-type 
mind occurs in only one out of 
thousands of millions of Jelmi. I 
found a very high probability, how- 
ever — point nine nine nine plus 
— that the techniques set. up by our 
ancestors are wrong. In breeding 
for contentment by destroying the 
discontented we are very probably 
breeding out the very characteristics 
we wish to encourage.” 

“Thank you, Beeloy. That finding 
was not unanticipated. Kalton, your 
report on Project University, please.” 

“Yes, sir.” An old male, so old 
that his fur was almost white, stood 
up. “Four hundred males and the 
same number of females, the most 
intelligent and most capable Jelmi 
alive, were selected and were brought 
here to the Llanzlanate. They were 
put into quarters that were J elm- 
type in every respect, even to gravity. 
They were given every inducement 
and every facility to work-study and 
to breed. 

“First, as to work-study. They 
have done practically nothing ex- 
cept waste time. They seem to de- 
vote their every effort to what they 
call ‘escape* by means of already- 
well-known constructions of the fifth 
and sixth orders — all of which are 
of course promptly negated. See 
for yourselves what these insanely 
illogical mancontents are doing and 
know for yourselves that, in its pres- 
ent form, Project University is a 
failure as far as producing intuitions 
is concerned.” 

Kalton picked up a fist-sized in- 



SKYLARK OUQUESNE 



It 




strument between the thumbs of his 
left hand and a tri-di “tank” appear- 
ed on the table’s top, in plain sight 
of every member of the Board. Then, 
as he began to finger controls, a 
three-dimensional scene in true color 
appeared in the tank; a smoothly- 
flowing, ever-shifting scene that 
moved from room to room and 
from place to place as the point of 
view traversed the vast volume of 
the prison. 

I t did not look like a prison. The 
apartments, of which there were 
as many as the Jelmi wanted, were 
furnished as luxuriously as the var- 
ious occupants desired; with furni- 
ture and equipment every item of 
which had been selected by each 
occupant himself or herself. There 
were wonderful rugs and hangings; 
masterpieces of painting and of sculp- 
ture; triumphs of design in fireplaces 
and tables and chairs and couches. 
Each room or suite could be set 
up for individual control of gravity, 
temperature, pressure, and humidity. 
Any imaginable item of food or drink 
was available on fifteen seconds’ no- 
tice at any hour of the day or night. 

In the magnificent laboratories 
every known or conceivable piece 
of apparatus could be had for the 
asking; the memory banks of the 
library would furnish in seconds any 
item of information that had been 
stored in any one of them during 
all seventy thousand years of the 
Realm's existence. 

And there were fully-equipped 
game and exercise rooms, ranging 
in size from tiny card-rooms up to 
a full-sized football field, to suit 



every Jelman need or desire for play 
or for exercise. 

But not one of the hundreds of 
Jelmi observed — each one a perfect 
specimen physically, as was plainly 
revealed by the complete absence 
of clothing — appreciated any one 
of these advantages! Most of the 
laboratories were vacant and dark. 
The few scientists who were ap- 
parently at work were not doing 
anything that made sense. The li- 
brary was not in use a‘t all; the 
Jelmi who were reading anything 
were reading works of purely Jelman 
authorship — mostly love stories, 
murder mysteries, and science fic- 
tion. Many Jelmi seemed to be busy 
but their activities were as pointless 
as cutting out paper dolls. 

“The pale, frail, practically hair- 
less, repulsive, incomplete, illogical, 
and insane animals refuse steadfast- 
ly to cooperate with us on any level.” 

Any Earthman so frustrated would 
have snarled the sentence, but the 
Llurd merely stated it as a fact. “You 
can all see for yourselves that as far 
as productive work is . but hold!” 

The viewpoint stopped moving 
and focussed sharply on a young 
man and a young woman who, bend- 
ing over a table, were working on 
two lengths of smooth yellow mate- 
rial that looked something like Grand 
Banks oilskin and something like 
varnished cambric. “Mergon and 
Luloy of planet Mallidax.” Kalton 
said into the microphone. “What are 
you doing? Whv are you so far away 
from your own laboratories?” 

Mergon straightened up and glared 
at what he thought was the point of 
origin of the voice. “If it’s any of 



20 



IF 




your business, funnyface, which k 
isn’t,” he said savagely, “I’m building 
a shortlong whatsit, and Luloy has 
nothing to do with k. When I get k 
done I’m personally going to tear 
your left leg off and beat you to * 
death with the bloody end of it” 

“You see?” Kalton dispassionately \ 

addressed the other members of the K 
Board “That reaction is typical.” > 

He manipulated controls and both i 

Jelmi leaped to their feet, with all 
four hands pressed to their buttocks. , 
The fact that Luloy was a woman — j 

scarcely more than a girl, in fact — 
was of no consequence at all to Kal- 
ton. Even Llurdan sex meant very 
little to the Llurdi. Jelman sex meant J 

nothing whatever. 7 

“Nerve-whip,” Kalton explained ^ 

to his fellows. He dropped his con- 
troller into his lap and the tri-di tank j 
vanished. “Nothing serious — only j 
slightly painful and producing only 
a little ecchymosis and extravasa- 
tion. Neither of those two beasts, \l * 
however, will be at all comfortable \ 
until they get back where they be- 1. 
long. Now, to oontinue my report: \ 

“So much for failure to work- ' i 

study. Failure-refusal to breed, \ 

while not possible of such simple and 
easy demonstration, is no less actual, 
effective, and determined. A purely d 

emotional, non-logical, and ridicu- 1 

lous factor they call ‘love’ seems to * 

be involved, as does their incompre- ( 

hensibly exaggerated, inexplicable * 

craving for "liberty* or ‘freedom’.” 

The Llanslar said thoughtfully, 

“But surely, unwillingness to breed 
cannot possibly affect the results of 
artificial insemination?” 

“It seems to, sir. Definitely. There

k some non-physical and non-log- 
ical, but nevertheless powerful, op- 
erator involved. My assistants and I 
liave not been able to develop any 
techniques that result in any except 
the most ephemeral pregnancies.” 

“You apparently wish to com- 
ment, Velloy?” Klazmon asked. 

“I certainly do!” a middle-aged 
female snapped, giving one tautly- 
outstretched wing a resounding 
whack with her tail. “Of course they 
haven’t! As Prime Sociologist I said 
five years ago and I repeat now that 
no mind of the quality of those of 
the Jelmi here in the llanzlanate can 
be coerced by any such gross phys- 
ical means. Kalton talks of them and 
thinks of them as animals — mean- 
ing lower animals. I said five years 
ago and still say that they are not. 
Their minds, while unstable and 
completely illogical and in many in- 
stances unsane to the point of in- 
sanity, are nevertheless minds of tre- 
mendous power. I told this Board five 
years ago that the only way to make 
that project work — to cause selected 
Jelmi to produce either ideas or 
young or both — was to give the se- 
lectees a perfect illusion of complete 
freedom, and I recommended that 
course of action. Since I could not 
prove my statement mathematically, 
my recommendation was rejected. 
While I still cannot prove that state- 
ment, it is still my considered opin- 
ion that it is true; and I now repeat 
both statement and recommendation. 
I will keep on repeating them at ev- 
ery opportunity as long as this Board 
wastes time by not accepting them. I 
remind you that you have already 
wasted — lost — over five years.” 



“Your statement becomes mom 
probable year by year,” the Llanzp 
Ian admitted. “Kalton, have yon 
anything more to say?” 

“Very little. Only that, since Proj- 
ect University has admittedly failed, 
we should of course adopt — ” 
Kalton was silenced in mid-sen- 
tence by a terrific explosion, which 
was followed by a rumbling crash 
as half of one wall of the Hall coir 
lapsed inward. 

A volume of Jelman air rushed 
in, enveloping a purposeful company 
of Jelmi in yellow coveralls and wear- 
ing gas-masks. Some of these invad- 
ers were shooting pistols; some wern 
using or throwing knives; but all wera 
covering and protecting eight Jelmi 
who were launching bombs at one 
great installation of sixth-order gear 
— the computer complex that was 
the very nerve center of the entire 
Realm. 

For the Jelmi — who, as has bee® 
said, were human to the last decimal 
of classification — had been working 
on fifth- and sixth-order devices pur^ 
ly as a blind; their real effort had 
been on first-order effects so old 
that their use had been all but for- 
gotten. 

T he Jelman plan was simple: Thir- 
ty men and thirty women would 
destroy the central complex of the 
computer system of the entire Realm. 
Then, if possible, the survivors o i 
the sixty would join their fellows in 
taking over an already-selected Llur- 
dan scout cruiser and taking off at 
max. 

It was quite probable that many 
or even most of the attacking sixty 



22 




would die. k was distinctly possible 
that they all would. All sixty, how- 
ever, were perfectly willing to trade 
their lives for that particular bank 
of sixth-order apparatus, in order 
that seven hundred forty other Jelmi 
could escape from Llurdiax and, 
before control could be re-estab- 
lished, be beyond their masters’ 
reach. 

Theoretically, the first phase of 
the operation should have been suc- 
cessful; the Realm’s nerve-center 
should have been blown to unrecog- 
nizable bits. The Jelmi knew exactly 
what they were going to do, exactly 
how they were going to do it, and 
exactly how long it would take. They 
knew that they would have the ad- 
vantage of complete surprise. There 
would be, they were sure, half a 
second or so of the paralysis of 
shock, followed by at least one sec- 
ond of utter confusion; which would 
give them plenty of time. 

They were sure it would be as 
though, during a full-formal session 
of the Supreme Court, a gang of 
hoodlums should blast down a wall 
and come leaping into the court- 
room with Tommy-guns ablaze and 
with long knives flying and stabbing 
and slashing. Grave, stately, and 
thoughtful, the justices could not 
possibly react fast enough to save 
their lives or their records or what- 
ever else it was that the gangsters 
were after. 

The Jelmi, however, had never 
seen any Llurd in emergency ac- 
tion; did not know or suspect how 
nearly instantaneous the Llurdan 
speed of reaotion was; did not real- 
ize that a perfectly logical mind can 



not be surprised by any happening, 
however unusual or however out- 
rageous. 

Thus: 

Yelling, shooting, throwing, stab- 
bing, slashing , the men and women 
of die Jelmi rushed into battle; to be 
met — with no paralysis and no con- 
fusion and no loss of time whatever 
— by buffeting wings, flailing tails, 
tearing teeth, and hard, highly skilled 
hands and fists and feet 

Many machine operators, as agile 
in the air as bats, met the bombs in 
midair and hurled them out into and 
along the corridor through the al- 
ready-breached wall, where they ex- 
ploded harmlessly. Harmlessly, that 
is, except for a considerable increase 
in the relatively unimportant struc- 
tural damage already wrought. 

Two knives were buried to their 
hilts in the huge flying muscles of the 
Llanzlan’s chest. His left wing hung 
useless, its bones shattered by bul- 
lets. So did his right arm. Neverthe- 
less, he made it at speed to his con- 
sole — and the battle was over. 

Beams of force lashed out, im- 
mobilizing the human beings where 
they stood. Curtains of force closed 
in, pressing the Jelmi together in- 
to a tightly packed group. An im- 
permeable membrane of force con- 
fined all the J elm an air and what- 
ever Lhirdan atmosphere had been 
mixed with it. 

The Llanzlan, after glancing at 
his own wounds and at the corps of 
surgeons already ministering to his 
more seriously wounded fellows, re- 
sumed his place at the conference 
table. 

He said, “This meeting will re-

sume. The places of those depart- 
ment heads who died will be taken 
by their first assistants. All depart- 
ment heads are hereby directed to 
listen, to note, and to act. Since Proj- 
ect University has failed, it is to be 
closed out immediately. All Jelmi — 
I perceive that none of those present 
is dead, or even seriously wounded — 
will be put aboard the ship in which 
they intended to leave Llurdiax. They 
will be given all the supplies, appa- 
ratus, and equipment that they care 
to requisition and will be allowed to 
take off for any destination they 
please.” 

He glanced at the captured Jelmi, 
imprisoned in their force-bubble of 
atmosphere. To them it reeked of 
methane and halogens, but they stood 
proudly and coldly listening to what 
he said. 

He dismissed them from his mind 
and said. “A recess will now be taken 
»o that those of us who are wounded 
may have our wounds dressed. After 
that we will consider in detail means 
of inducing the Jelmi to resume the 
producton of breakthroughs in 
science. ”

FREE (?) 

S ome hours later, far out in deep 
space, the- ex-Liurdan scout 
cruiser — now named the Mallidax, 
after the most populous Jelman 
planet of the Realm — bored savage- 
ly through the ether. Ift crew of late 
revolutionaries, still dazed by the 
fact that they were still alive, re- 
cuperated in their various ways. 



In one of the larger, more kixw- 
ious cabins Luloy of Mallidax lap 
prone on a three-quarter-size-bed, 
sobbing convulsively, uncontrott*- 
bly. Her left eye was swollen shut 
The left side of her face and moat 
of her naked body bore livid black 
and blue bruises — bruises so brutally 
severe that the marks of Kalton's 
sense-whip punishment, incurred 
earlier for insubordination, were al- 
most invisible. A dozen bandages 
showed white against the bronzed 
skin of her neck and shoulders and 
torso and arms and legs. 

“Oh, snap out of it, Lu, please l” 
Mergon ordered, almost bruskly. He 
was a burly youth with crew-cut 
straw-colored hair*, and he, too, 
showed plenty of evidence of hav- 
ing been to the wars. He had even 
more bruises and bandages than she 
did. “Don’t claim that you wanted 
to be a martyr any more than I did. 
And they can engrave it on a plati- 
num plaque that I’m damned glad 
to get out of that fracas alive.” 

Stopping her crying by main 
strength, the girl hauled herself up 
into a half-sitting position and glared 
at the man out of her one good eye. 

“You . you clod!” she stormed. 
“It isn’t that at all! And you know 
it as well as I do. It’s just that we 
. they . he . not a single 
one of them so much as . why, 
we might just as well have been mere- 
ly that many mosquitoes — midges — 
worse, exactly that many perfectly 
innocuous saprophytic bacilli.” 

“Exactly,” he agreed, sourly, and 
her glare changed to a look almost 
of surprise. “That’s precisely what 
we were. It’s humiliating, yes. It's

devastating and it’s frustrating. Wa 
tried to hit the Lhirdi where k 
hurt, and they ignored us. Agreed. 
I don’t like it a bit better than you 
do; but caterwauling and being sorry 
for yourself isn’t going to help mat- 
ters a — ” 

“Caterwauling! Being sorry for 
myself! If that's what you think, you 
can . .” 

“Stop it, Lu!” he broke in sharp- 
ly, “before I have to spank your 
fanny to a rosy blister !” 

She threw up her head m defiance; 
then what was almost a smile began 
to quirk at the corners of her bat- 
tered mouth. “You can’t, Merg,” she 
said, much more quietly than she 
had said anything so far. “Look — 
it’s all red, green, blue, yellow, and 
black already. That last panel I 
bounced off of was no pillow, 
friend.” 

“Llenderllon’s favor, sweetheart!” 
Bending over, he kissed her gingerly, 
then drew a deep breath of relief. 
“You scared me like I don’t know 
when I’ve been scared before,” he 
admitted. “We need you too much — 
and I love you too much — to have 
you go off the deep end now. Es- 
pecially now, when for the first time 
in our lives we’re in position to do 
something.” 

“Such as what?” Luloy’s tone was 
more lifeless than skeptical. “How 
many of our whole race are worth 
saving, do you think? How many 
Jelmi of all our worlds can be made 
to believe that their present way of 
life is anything short of perfection?” 

“Very few, probably,” Mergon 
conceded. “As of now. But — ” 

He paused, looking around their 



suaoundmgs. The spaceship, which 
had once been one of the Liurdi*a 
beet, might have a few surprises for 
them. It was a matter for debate 
whether the Llurdi might not have 
put concealed spy devices in the 
rooms. On balance, however, Mer- 
gon thought not The Llurdi operated 
on grander scales than that. 

He said, “Luk>y, listen. We tried 
to fight our way to freedom by at- 
tacking the Llurdi right where it 
hurts, in center of their power. We 
lost the battle. But we have what we 
were fighting for, don’t we? Why do 
you think they let us go, perfectly 
free?” 

L uloy’s eye brightened a little, but 
not too much. “That’s plain 
enough. Since they couldn’t make us 
produce either new theories or chil- 
dren in captivity, they’re giving us 
what they say is complete freedom, 
so that we’ll produce both. How 
stupid do they think we are? How 
stupid can they get? If we could 
have wrecked their long eyes, yes, 
we could have got away clean to a 
planet in some other galaxy, ‘way 
out of their range; but now? If I 
know anything at all, it’s that they’ll 
hold a tracer beam — so weak as to 
be practically indetectable, of course 
— on us forever.” 

“I think you’re right,” Mergon 
said, and paused. Luloy looked at 
him questioningly and he went on, 
“I’m sure you are, but I don’t think 
it’s us they are aiming at. They’re 
probably taking the long view — bet- 
ting that, with a life-long illusion 
of freedom, we’ll have children of 
our own free will.”

Luloy nodded thoughtfully. ‘‘And 
\wt would,” she said, definitely. “All 
j#f us would. For, after all, if we 
en this ship all die childless what 
chance is there that any other Jelmi 
will try it again for thousands of 
years? And our children would have 
a chance, even if we never have an- 
other.” 

“True. But on the other hand, how 
■uuay generations will it take for 
tilings now known to be facts to de- 
generate into myths? To be discred- 
ited completely, in spite of the solid- 
cat records we can make as to the 
•ruth and the danger?” 

Luloy started to gnaw her lip, but 
winced sharply and stopped the mo- 
tion. “I see what you mean. Inevit- 
able. But you don’t seem very down- 
cast about it, so you have an idea. 
Tell me, quick!” 

“Yes, but I’m just hatching it; 1 
haven’t mentioned it even to Tam- 
non yet, so I don’t know whether 
it will work or not. At present a 
tixth-order break-through can’t be 
hidden from even a very loose sur- 
veillance. Right?” 

By now Luloy’s aches and pains 
were forgotten. Eyes bright, she 
aodded. “You’re so right. Do you 
think one can be? Possibly? How?” 

“By finding a solar system some- 
'where whose inhabitants know so 
much more than we do that the em- 
anations of their sixth-order instal- 
lations continuously or regularly at 
work will mask those of any full- 
tcale tests we want to make. There 
must be some such race, somewhere 
in this universe. The Llurdi charted 
this universe long ago — they call it 
U-Prime — and I requisitioned copies 

S6 



of all the tapes. Second: the Llurdi 
are all strictly logical. Right?” 

“That’s right,” the girl agreed. 
“Strictly. Insanely, almost, you might 
say.” 

‘So my idea is to do something 
as illogical as possible. They think 
we’li head for a new planet of our 
own; either in this galaxy or one not 
too far away. So we won’t. We’ll 
drive at absolute max for the center 
of the universe, with the most sen- 
sitive feelers we have full ‘out for 
very strong sixth-order emanations. 
En route, we’ll use every iota of 
brain-power aboard this heap in de- 
veloping some new band of the sixth, 
being mighty careful to use so little 
power that the ship’s emanations will 
mask it. Having found the hiding- 
place we want, we’ll tear into de- 
veloping and building something, 
not only that the Llurdi haven’t got, 
but a thing that by use of which we 
can bust Llanzlan Klazmon the Fif- 
teenth loose from his wings and tail 
— and through which he can’t fight 
back. So, being absolutely — stupidly 
— logical about everything, what 
would His Supreme Omnipotence 
do about it?” 

Luloy thought in silence for a 
few seconds, then tried unsuccess- 
fully to whistle through battered, 
swollen lips. “Oh, boy!” she ex- 
claimed, delightedly. “Slug him with 
a thing like that — demonstrate su- 
periority — and the battle is over. 
He’ll concede us everything we want, 
full equality, independence, you 
name it, without a fight — without 
even an argument!” 

Grinning, Mergon caught her arm 
And led her out of the room. 

IF 




Throughout the great hulk of the 
Llurd spaceship the other battered 
Jelmi veterans were beginning to stir. 
To each of them, Mergon explained 
his plan and from each came the 
lame response. “Oh, boy!” 

They began at once setting up their 
work plans. 

The first project was to find— 
somewhere! — a planet generating 
sufficient sixth-order forces to screen 
what they were going to do. In the 
great vastnesses of the Over-Uni- 
verse there were many such planets. 
They could have chosen that which 
was inhabited by Norlaminian or 
Dasorian peoples. They could have 
chosen one of a score which were 
comparatively nearby. They, in fact, 
ultimately chose and set course for 
the third planet of a comparatively 
•mall G-type star known to its people 
as Tellus, or Earth. 

They could have given many rea- 
»ons why this particular planet had 
been selected. 

None of these reasons would have 
included the receipt of the brief 
pulse of telepathic communication 
which none of them, any longer, 
consciously remembered. 

A nd back on Llurdiax the Llanz- 
lan followed the progress of the 
fleeing ship of Jelm rebels with calm 
perception. 

His great bat wings were already 
wending, even as the scars of the 
late assauK on his headquarters were 
already nearly repaired by a host of 
•ervo-mechanisms. Deaf to the noise 
and commotion of the repairs, heed- 
less of the healing wounds which any 
human would have devoted a month 



in bed to curing, the Lianzlan once 
again summoned his department 
heads and issued his pronounce- 
ment: 

“War, being purely destructive, 
is a product of unsanity. The Jelmi 
are, however, unsane; many of them 
are insane. Thus, if allowed to do so, 
they commit warfare at unpredict- 
able times and for incomprehensible, 
indefensible, and/or whimsical rea- 
sons. Nevertheless, since the tech- 
niques we have been employing have 
been proven ineffective and there- 
fore wrong, they will now be 
changed. During the tenure of this 
directive no more Jelmi will be ex- 
ecuted or castrated : in fact, a certain 
amount of unsane thinking will not 
merely be tolerated but encouraged, 
even though it lead to the unsanity 
termed ‘war’. It should not, however, 
be permitted to exceed that quantity 
of ‘war’ which would result in the 
destruction of, let us say, three of 
their own planets. 

“This course will entail a risk that 
we, as the ‘oppressors’ of the Jelmi, 
will be attacked by them. The mag- 
nitude of this risk — the probability 
of such an attack — cannot be calcu- 
lated with the data now available. Al- 
so, these data are rendered even lesa 
meaningful by the complete unpre- 
dictability of the actions of the group 
of Jelmi released from study here. 

“It is therefore directed that afl 
necessary steps be taken particular- 
ly in fifth and sixth-order devices, 
that no even theoretically possible 
attack on this planet wiH succeed. 

“This meeting will now adjourn.” 

It did; and within fifteen minutes 
heavy construction began — conatruc-

tion that was to go on at a pace and 
on a scale and with an intensity of 
drive theretofore unknown through- 
out the Realm’s long history. Whole 
worldlets were destroyed, scavenged 
for their minerals, their ores smelted 
in giant atomic space-borne foun- 
dries and cast and shaped into com- 
plex machines of offense and de- 
fense. Delicate networks of radiation 
surrounded every Jelm and Llurd 
world, ready to detect, trace, report 
and home on any artifact whatsoever 
which might approach them. Weap- 
ons capable of blasting moons out 
of orbit slipped into position in great 
latticework spheres of defensive em- 
placements. 

The Llurdi were preparing for any- 
thing. 

Llurdan computations were never 
wrong. Computers, however, even 
Llurdan computers, are not really 
smart — they can’t really think. Un- 
like the human brain, they can not 
arrive at valid conclusions from in- 
sufficient data. In fact, they don’t 
even try to. They stop working and 
say — in words or by printing or typ- 
ing or by flashing a light or by ring- 
ing a bell — “DATA INSUFFI- 
CIENT”: and then continue to do 
nothing until they are fed additional 
information. 

Thus, while the Llanzlan and his 
mathematicians and logicians fed 
enough data into their machines to 
obtain valid conclusions, there were 
many facts that no Llurd then knew. 
And thus those conclusions, while 
valid, were woefully incomplete; 
they did not cover all of actuality by 
far. 

For, in actuality, there had al- 



ready begun a chain of events that 
was to render those mighty fortresses 
precisely as efficaceous against one 
certain type of attack as that man) 
cubic miles of sheerest vacuum. 

IV 

Llurdi and Fenachrone 

T he type of attack which was 
about to challenge the Llurdi 
was from a source no civilized hu- 
man would have believed still existed. 

If Richard Seaton, laboring at 
Earth’s own defenses uncountable 
parsecs away, had been told of it, 
he would flatly have declared the 
story a lie. He ought to know, he 
would have said. That particular dan- 
ger to the harmony of the worlds 
had long since been destroyed . 
and he was the man who had de- 
stroyed it! 

When the noisome planet of the 
Fenachrone was destroyed it was 
taken for granted that Ravindau and 
his faction of the Party of Postpone- 
ment of Universal Conquest, who 
had fled from the planet just before 
its destruction, were the last sur- 
viving members of their monstrous 
race. When they in turn were de- 
stroyed it was assumed that no Fen- 
achrone remained alive. 

That assumption was wrong. There 
was another faction of the Party of 
Postponement much larger than Rav- 
indau’s, much more secretive, and 
much better organized. 

Its leader, one Sleemet, while an 
extremely able scientist, had taken 
lifelong pains that neither his name 
nor his ability should become known 



28 



IF 




Id any except a select few. He was 
as patriotic as was any other mem- 
ber of his race; he believed as im- 
plickly as did any other that the 
Penachrone should and one day 
would rule not only this one universe, 
but the entire Cosmic All. However, 
be believed, and as firmly, that The 
Day should not be set until the 
probability of success of the project 
should begin to approach unity as a 
limit. 

According to Sleemet’s exceedingly 
rigorous analysis, the time at which 
success would become virtually cer- 
tain would not arrive for at least 
three hundred Fenachronian years. 

From the day of Fenor’s accession 
to the throne Sleemet had been grim- 
ly certain that this Emperor Fenor — 
headstrong, basically ignorant, and 
inordinately prideful even for an ab- 
solute monarch of the Fenachrone 
— would set The Day during his own 
reign; centuries before its proper 
time. 

Therefore, for over fifty years, 
Sleemet had been preparing for ex- 
actly the eventuality that came about, 
and: 

Therefore, after listening to only a 
few phrases of the ultimatum given 
to Emperor Fenor by Sacner Carfon 
of Dasor, speaking for the Overlord 
Seaton and his Forces of Universal 
Peace, Sleemet sent out his signal, 
and: 

Therefore, even before Ravindau’s 
forces began to board their single 
vessel Sleemet’s fleet of seventeen 
tuperdreadnoughts was out in deep 
apace, blasting at full-emergency 
fifth-order cosmic-energy drive away 
from the planet so surely doomed. 



Surely doomed? Yes. Knowing 
vastly more about the sixth order 
than did any other of his race, he 
was the only one of his race who 
knew anything about the Overlord 
of the Central System; of who and 
what that Overlord was and of what 
that Overlord had done. He, Sleemet, 
did not want any part of Richard 
Ballinger Seaton. Not then or ever. 

Curse Fenor’s abysmal stupidity! 
Since a whole new Fenachrone plan- 
et would now have to be developed, 
the Conquest could not be begun for 
more than three hundred years! 

While Sleemet knew much more 
about the sixth order than Ravindau 
did, he did not have the sixth-order 
drive and it took him and his scien- 
tists and engineers several months to 
develop and to perfect it. Thus their 
fleet was still inside the First Galaxy 
when they finally changed drives and 
began really to travel — on a course 
that, since it was laid out to reach 
the most distant galaxies of the First 
Universe, would of necessity lie 
within two and a quarter hundreds 
of thousands of light-years of the 
galaxy in which the Realm of the 
Llurdi lay. 

A s has been intimated, the Llurdi 
were literal folk. When any 
llanzlan issued a directive he meant 
it literally, and it was always as lit- 
erally carried out. 

Thus, when Llanzlan Klazmon or- 
dered the construction of an instal- 
lation of such a nature that “no even 
theoretically possible attack on this 
planet will succeed” he meant pre- 
cisely that — and that was precisely 
what was built. Nor, since the Llurdi 



SKYLARK DUQUESNE 



29 




had full command of the fourth and 
fifth orders, and some sixth-order 
apparatus as well, was the task over- 
long in the doing. 

The entire one-hundred-six-mile 
circumference of Llurdias and a wide 
annulus outside the city proper were 
filled with tremendous fortresses; 
each of which was armed and pow- 
ered against any contingency to 
which Computer Prime — almost half 
a cubic mile of miniaturization 
packed with the accumulated knowl- 
edges and happenings of some sev- 
enty thousand years — could assign a 
probability greater than point zero 
zero zero one. 

Each of those fortresses covered 
five acres of ground; was low and 
flat. Each was built of super-hard, 
super-tough, super-refractory syn- 
thetic. Each had twenty-seven high- 
rising, lightning-rodlike spikes of the 
same material. Fortress-shell and 
spikes through closely spaced cast-in 
tubes; and the entire periphery of 
each fortress, as well as dozens of 
interior relief-points, went deep into 
constantly water-soaked, heavily 
salted ground. Each fortress sprouted 
scores of antennae — parabolic, box, 
fiat, and straight — and scores of 
heavily insulated projectors of shapes 
to be defined only by a professional 
mathematician of solid geometry. 

And how the Llurdan detectors 
could now cover space! The Jelm 
Mergon, long before his abortive at- 
tempt to break jail, had developed a 
miniaturized monitor station that 
could detect, amplify, and retransmit 
cm an aimed tight beam any fifth-or 
sixth-order signal from and to a dis- 
tance of many kiloparsecs. 



Hundreds of these “mergons” were 
already out in deep space. Now mer- 
gons were being manufactured in lots 
of a thousand, and in their thousands 
they were being hurled outward from 
Llurdiax, to cover — by relays en 
cascade — not only the Llurdan gal- 
axy and a great deal of inter-galactic 
space, but also a good big chunk of 
inter-universal space as well. 

T he Fenachrone fleet bored on 
through inter-galactic space at 
its distance-devouring sixth-order 
pace. Its fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-or- 
der detector webs fanned out far — 
“far” in the astronomical sense of 
the word — ahead of it. They were 
set to detect, not only the most 
tenuous cloud of gas, but also any 
manifestation whatever upon any otf 
the known bands of any of those or- 
ders. Similar detectors reached out 
to an equal distance above and below 
and to the left of and to the right 
of the line of flight; so that the en- 
tire forward hemisphere was on con- 
tinuous web of ultra-tenuous but ul- 
tra-sensitive detection. 

And, as that fleet approached a 
galaxy lying well to “starboard” — 
the term was still in use aboard ship 
except for matters of record, since 
the direction of action of artificial 
gravity, whatever its actual direction, 
was always “down” — two sets of de- 
tectors tripped at once. 

The squat and monstrous officer 
on watch reported this happening in- 
stantly, of course, to Sleemet himself; 
and of course Sleemet himself went 
instantly into action. He energized 
his flagship’s immense fifth-order 
projector.

thing else. They could not be damped 
out or masked and they could be de- 
tected very easily by whoever or 
whatever it was that was out there 
... Yes, an exploration would not 
change matters at all . 

A s a matter of fact, the Fena- 
chrone’s Fleet’s emanations had 
been detected a full two seconds 
since. 

A far-outpost mergon had picked 
it up and passed it along to a second, 
which in turn had relayed it inward 
to its Number Three, which Finally 
had delivered it to Computer Prime 
on incredibily distant Llurdiax. 

There, in Hall. Prime of Compu- 
tation, a section "supervisor had 
flicked the switch that had trans- 
ferred the unusual bit of information 
to his immediate superior, Head 
Supervisor Klarton — who had at 
sight of it gone into a tizzy (for a 
Llurd) of worrying his left ear with 
the tip of his tail. He stared at the 
motionless bit of tape as though it 
were very apt indeed to bite him in 
the eye. 

What to do? Should he disturb the 
llanzlan with this or not? 

This was a nose-twitching border- 
line case if there ever was one. If 
he didn’t, and it turned out to be 
something important, he’d get his 
tail singed — he’d be reduced to sec- 
tion supervisor. Put if he did, and it 
didn’t, he’d get exactly the same 
treatment . However, the thing, 
whatever it might be, was so terrif- 
ically far away . 

Yes, that was it! The smart thing 
to do would be to watch it for a few 
seconds — determine exact distance, 



direction of flight, velocity, and wo 
forth — before reporting to the Big 
Boss. That would protect him either 
way. 

W herefore Sleemet had time to 
launch an analsynth projection 
along the indicated line. 

He found a solar system contain- 
ing two highly industrialized planets; 
one of which was cool, the other 
cold. One was peopled by those nev- 
er-to-be-sufficiently-damned human 
beings; the other by a race of crea- 
tures even more monstrous and there- 
fore even less entitled to exist. 

He studied those planets and their 
inhabitants quickly but thoroughly, 
and the more he studied them the 
more derisive and contemptuous he 
became. They had no warships, no 
fortresses either above or below 
ground, no missiles, even! Their ev- 
ery effort and all their energies were 
devoted to affairs of peace ! 

Therefore, every detail having been 
recorded, including the gibberish be- 
ing broadcast and tightbeamed by 
various communications satellites, 
Sleemet pulled in his analsynth and 
sent out a full working projection. 

He had already located great 
stores of prepared power-uranium 
bars and blocks on both planets. 
Careless of detection now and work- 
ing at his usual fantastic speed and 
with his usual perfect control, he 
built in seconds six tremendous pyra- 
mids upon each of the two doomed 
worlds — pyramids of now one-hun- 
dred-percent-convertible superatomic 
explosive. He assembled twenty-four 
exceedingly complex, carefully aimed 
forces and put them on trip. Then,

flaring baJefuUy into an almost 
opaque visiplate, he reached out 
without looking and rammed a 
plunger home — and in an instant 
those two distant planets became two 
tremendous fireballs of hellishly in- 
tolerable. mostly invisible, energies. 

And almost eight thousand million 
highly intelligent creatures — eating, 
sleeping, loving, fighting, reading, 
thinking, working, playing — died in 
that utterly cataclysmic rending of 
two entire worlds. 

P ractically all of them died not 
knowing even that they had 
been hurt. A few — a very few — 
watch officers in interplanetary 
spaceships observed one or the other 
of those frightful catastrophes in 
time to have an instant’s warning of 
what was coming; but only three 
such officers, it became known later, 
had enough time to throw on their 
faster-than-light drives and thus out- 
run the ravening front of annihila- 
tion. 

Cosmically, however, the thing 
didn’t amount to much. Its duration 
was very short indeed. While a little 
of each planet’s substance was vol- 
atilized, practically all of it was 
scarcely more than melted. When 
equilibrium was restored they did 
not shine like little suns. They 
scarcely glowed. 

Hands quietly poised, Sleemet 
again paused in thought. 

The fact that he had murdered al- 
most eight billion people did not 
bother him at all. In fact, he did not 
think of the action at all, as murder 
or as killing or as anything else. If 
he had, the thought would have been 



the Fenachrone equivalent of “pesti- 
cide”. All space comprising the Cos- 
mic All and every planet therein 
should and would belong to the 
Master Race; no competing race had 
any right whatever to live. 

Should he, or should he not, ex- 
plore the lines of those communica- 
tions beams and destroy the other 
planets of this group? He should not, 
he decided. He would have to slow 
down, perhaps even change course; 
and it was quite possible that he was 
still within range of the sixth-order 
stuff of that self-styled Overlord. 
Besides, this group of queerly 
mixed entities would keep. After he 
had found a really distant Fenatype 
planet and had developed it, he 
would come back here and finish 
this minor chore. 

But very shortly after making this 
decision Sleemet was given cause 
to know starkly that he had not in- 
vestigated this civilization thorough- 
ly enough by far; for his vessel was 
being assailed by forces of such in*; 
credible magnitude that his instant 
taneously reactive outer screen was 
already radiating in the high violet! 

And, before he could do much 
more than put a hand to his con- 
struction panel, that outer screen be- 
gan to show black spots of failure! 

I n Hall of Prime Computation, on 
Llurdiax, one entire panel of in- 
strumentation went suddenly dead. 
The supervisor of that section flicked 
two testing switches, then scanned 
the last couple of inches of each of 
two tapes. Then he paused, for a mo- 
ment stunned: knocked completely 
out of any Llurd’s calm poise. Then, 



SKYLARK DUQUESKE

licking his lips, he spoke; apparently 
to empty air: 

“Llanzlan Klazmon, sir, Blay- 
daxorb Three and Blaydaxorb Five 
stopped reporting, simultaneously, 
eleven seconds ago. Orbiting pyro- 
meters of both planets reported ther- 
monuclear temperatures at the end- 
points of their respective transmis- 
sions. End of report, sir.” 

The supervisor did not elaborate. 

While he was appalled and ter- 
ribly shocked — he had never im- 
agined such disasters possible — it 
was not his job to comment or to de- 
duce or to theorize. His business — 
his only business — was to report to 
a higher echelon the pertinent facts 
of any and all unusual events or 
conditions; the height of the echelon 
to which he reported being directly 
proportional to the unusualness and/ 
or magnitude of the event or condi- 
tion. 

Since this event was unprecedent- 
ed and of very great magnitude in- 
deed, his report went straight to the 
top — thus overtaking and passing the 
report of Head Supervision Klaron, 
which was not yet ready for delivery. 

Having reported the pertinent 
facts to the proper echelon, the sec- 
tion supervisor went calmly, almost 
unconcernedly, back to his job of 
supervising his section. He paid no 
more attention to the incident even 
when the llanzlan — fully recovered 
now from his wounds — who had 
been asleep in his penthouse apart- 
ment came into the Hall from the 
down-flyway. (Everyone rode a 
force-beam up, but came down on 
his own wings.) 

While Klazmon was not hurrying 



any more than usual, his usual 
technique was to drop a full half mile 
with folded wings before beginning 
to put on his brakes. Hence his tre- 
mendous wings and stabilizing sur- 
faces sent blasts of cold, dense air 
throughout the whole end of the 
Hall as he slowed down for a high-G 
landing in his seat at his master-con- 
trol console. Fingers, thumbs, and 
tail-tip flashed over the banked and 
tiered keyboards of that console; 
and, all around the periphery of 
Llurdias, that miles-wide girdle of 
mighty fortresses came instantly to 
life. 

A multi-layered umbrella of full- 
coverage screens flashed into being 
over the whole city and Klazmon, 
engineering his fifth-order projector, 
sent his simulacrum of pure force 
out to see what had happened in or 
to the solar system of Blaydaxorb. 

He was now, to all intents and 
purposes, in two places at once. 

He could see, hear, feel, taste, and 
smell exactly as well with one self 
as with the other. He was, however, 
thoroughly accustomed to the pe- 
culiar sensations of having a com- 
plete personality; he could block out 
at will any perceptions of either self. 
And his immaterial self had two tre- 
mendous advantages over his ma- 
terial one. It could traverse incred- 
ibly immense distances in no meas- 
urable time; and, no matter where 
it went or what it encountered, his 
physical self would remain entirely 
unaffected. 

In a mere flick of time, then, 
Klazmon was in the solar system of 
Blaydaxorb. The sun itself was un- 
changed, but in orbits three and five, 



34 



IF 




where the two inhabited planets had 
been, there were two still-wildly-dis- 
turbed masses of liquids and gases. 

He threw out a light, fast detec- 
tor web, which located the maraud- 
ing Fenachrone fleet in less than a 
second. Then, returning most of his 
attention to his console, he assem- 
bled seventeen exceedingly complex 
forces and hurled them, one at each 
vessel of the invading fleet. 

Actually, Klazmon was little if 
any more affected than was Sleemet 
the Fenachrone about either that ut- 
terly frightful loss of life as such or 
the loss of those two planets as such. 
The Realm was big enough so that 
the total destruction of those two 
planets — of any two planets except 
of course Llurdiax itself — was un- 
important to the economy of the 
Realm as a whole. No; what burned 
the llanzlan up — made it mandatory 
that that fleet and the entire race 
whose people manned it should, after 
thorough study, be wiped completely 
out — was the brazenness, the unciv- 
ilized and illogical savagery, the in- 
credible effrontery of this complete- 
ly intolerable insult to the realm of 
die Llurdi and to imperial Klazmon 
its llanzlan. 

Klazmon knew of only one race 
who made a habit of performing 
such atrocities; such wanton, illog- 
ical, insane offenses against all sense 
and all reason : those chlorine-breath- 
ing, amoeboid monstrosities inhabit- 
ing Galaxy DW-427-LU. Those crea- 
tures, however, as far as any Llurd 
had ever learned, had always con- 
fined their activities to their own gal- 
axy. If, Klazmon thought grimly to 
himself, those insanely murderous 



amoeboids had decided to extend 
their operations into the Galaxy of 
the Llurdi, they would find such ex- 
tension a very expensive one indeed. 

Wherefore, hunched now over a 
black-filtered visiplate, with slitted 
eyes narrow and cat-whiskers stiffly 
outthrust; with both hands manipu- 
lating high-ratio vernier knobs in in- 
finitesimal arcs; Klazmon shoveled 
on the coal. 

V 

Combat! 

A s has been said, the Llurdi were 
a literal folk. Klazmon's direc- 
tive had specified “. that no even 
theoretically possible attack on this 
planet will succeed.” 

Hence that was precisely what 
had been built. No conceivable force 
or combination of forces, however 
applied and even at pointblank range, 
oould crack Llurdiax’s utterly impen- 
etrable shields. 

Nor was that all; for Llurdan en- 
gineers, as well as Llurdan philos- 
ophers, were thoroughly familiar 
with the concept that “The best de- 
fense is a powerful offense.” Where- 
fore Llurdiax’s offensive projectors 
were designed to smash down any 
theoretically possible threat origin- 
ating anywhere within a distance that 
light would require one and three- 
quarters millions of Tellurian years 
to traverse. 

Under the thrustings and the stab- 
bings, the twistings and the tearings, 
the wrenchings and the bludgeonings 
of those frightful fields of force, 
seventeen sets of Fenachrone defen- 



SKYLARK DUQUESNE

»ve screens — outer, intermediate, and 
inner — went successively upward 
' through the visible spectrum, through 
the ultra-violet, and into the black 
of failure; baring the individual ves- 
sel’s last lines of defense, the wall- 
shields themselves. 

Then Klazmon increased the 
power, gouging and raving at those 
ultra-stubborn defenses until those 
defenses were just barely holding; at 
which point he relaxed a little, read 
his verniers, leaned back in his buck- 
et seat, and took stock. 

The marauding spaceships were 
tremendous things; cigar-shaped; 
flying in hollow-globe formation with 
one vessel — the flagship, of course — 
at the exact center; spaced so closely 
that their screens had overlapped — 
overlapped in such fashion that un- 
less and until that shell of force was 
broken no attack could be made 
upon that central ship. 

So far, so good. With the over- 
whelming superiority of ultimate- 
planetary over any at-al 1-probable 
mobile installations he, Llanzlan 
Klazmon the Fifteenth, had smashed 
that shell completely. He could, he 
was sure, destroy all those vessels 
as completely. 

But it would not do at all to de- 
stroy even one of them without ex- 
amining both it and its crew. Klaz- 
mon had to know the who and the 
what and the wherefore and the how 
and the why. Therefore, leaving all 
of his attacking beams exactly as 
they were. Klazmon assembled an- 
other gigantic beam — the entire out- 
put of one Llurdiaxian fortress — and 
hurled it against the tail-section of 
the flagship. 



Wall-shield and tail-section* van- 
ished in a few manoseconds of time; 
and not only the tail-section, but 
also a few hundreds of yards of the 
flagship’s prodigious length as well, 
became a furiously raging fireball; a 
sphere of violence incredible. 

Klazmon drove his projection for- 
ward then, through the now unre- 
sisting steel wall and into the con- 
trol room; where it was met by 
blasts of force from the hand-wea- 
pons of the Fenachrone officers. 

This demonstration, however, last- 
ed for only a second or two. Then 
those officers, knowing what it was 
that was standing there so uncon- 
cernedly, abandoned their physical 
assault and attacked the invading 
projection with the full power of the 
huge, black, flame-shot wells of hyp- 
notic force that were their eyes. 
When the mental attack also failed 
they merely stood there; glaring a 
hatred that was actually tangible. 

K dazmon immobilized each one 
of the officers individually with 
pencils of force and began to study 
them intensively. While much short- 
er and thicker and wider and im- 
mensely stronger than the Jelmi Of 
the Realm, they were definitely Jel- 
moid in every important respect . 
yes, the two races had certainly had 
a common ancestry, and not too far 
back. Also, their thinking and con- 
duct were precisely as was to be ex- 
pected of any Jelman or Jelmoid 
race that had been allowed to devel- 
op in its unsane and illogical way 
for many thousands of years without 
the many benefits of Llurdan con- 
trol! 



36 



IF 




They would of course have 
thought-exchange gear; any race of 
their evident advancement must have 
... ah, yes; over there. 

Now — which of these wights 
would be the admiral? That one 
wearing the multiplex scanner would 
be the pilot; that one facing the 
banks of dials and gages would be 
the prime engineer; those six panels 
had to be battle panels, so those six 
monsters had to be gunnery officers 
. ah! 

That one there — off by himself; 
seated (in spite of the fact that with 
their short, blocky legs no Fena- 
chrone had any need, ever, to sit) at 
a desk that was practically a throne; 
facing no gadgetry and wearing con- 
sciously an aura of power and auth- 
ority — that one would be the one 
Klazmon wanted. 

Klazmon’s projection flashed up 
to the motionlessly straining admiral. 
The helmets of the “mechanical ed- 
ucator” snapped onto the Llurd’s 
quietly studious head and onto the 
head with the contemptuously sneer- 
ing face — the head of First Scientist 
Fleet Admiral Sleemet of the Fena- 
chrone. 

That face, however, lost its sneer 
instantly, for Sleemet — even more 
overweeningly and brutally and 
vaingloriously prideful now than 
were the lower echelons of his race 
— had never imagined the possibility 
of the existence of such a mind as 
this monstrous invader had. 

Klazmon’s mind, the product of 
seventy thousand years of coldly 
logical evolution, tore ruthlessly into 
the mind of the Fenachrone. It bored 
into and twisted at that straining 



mind’s hard-held blocks; it battered 
and shattered them; it knocked them 
down flat. 

Then Klazmon, omnivorous schol- 
ar that he was, set about transferring 
to his own brain practically every- 
thing that the Fenachrone had eyer 
learned. Klazmon learned, as Rich- 
ard Seaton had learned previously, 
that all Fenachron having authority 
and responsibility were meticulous 
record-keepers. He learned what had 
happened to the civilization of the 
Fenachrone and to its world, and 
who had done it and how; he learned 
that each and every captain knew ex- 
actly the same and had exactly the 
same records as did First Scientist 
Fleet Admiral Sleemet himself; he 
learned that each vessel, alone by it- 
self, was thoroughly capable of re- 
creating the entire Fenachrone civ- 
ilization and culture. 

A few of the many other thou- 
sands of things that Klazmon learned 
were: That there were many Jel- 
man and Jelmoid — human and hu- 
manoid, that is — races living in what 
they called the First Galaxy. That 
all these races were alike in destruc- 
tiveness, belligerence to the point of 
war-lust, savagery, implacability, 
vengefulness, intolerance, and fright- 
fulness generally. Not one of them 
(by Klazmon’s light!) had any re- 
deeming features or qualities what- 
ever. That all these races must be 
destroyed if any worthwhile civiliza- 
tion were ever to thrive and spread. 

There was no word in any lan- 
guage of the Realm of the Llurdi 
corresponding even remotely to “gen- 
ocide”. If there had been, Klazmon 
would have regarded it as an ety- 



SKYLARK DUQUESNE 



37 




mol ogival curiosity. All those sur- 
viving Fenachrone would have to 
die: no such race as that had any 
right whatever to live. 

Before being destroyed, however, 
they would have to be studied with 
Llurdan thoroughness; and any and 
all worthwhile ideas and devices and 
other artifacts should be and would 
be incorporated into the Llurdan- 
Jelman way of life. 

One vessel would be enough, how- 
ever, to preserve temporarily for the 
purpose of study. In fact, what was 
left of the flagship would be enough. 

The now-vanished tail-section had 
contained nothing new to Llurdan 
science, the encyclopedic records 
were intact, and the flagship’s per- 
sonnel — males and females, adults 
and adolescents and children and 
babies — were alive and well. 

W herefore sixteen sets of multi- 
plex projectors doubled their 
drain of power from Llurdias’ mighty 
defensive girdle, and all the Fena- 
chrone aboard sixteen superdread- 
ooughts died in situ, wherever they 
happened to be, as those sixteen 
vessels became tiny, sunlets. 

And the llanzlan issued orders: 

1) The bulk of the Fenachrone 
flagship was to be brought in to the 
Uanzlanate at full sixth-order drive. 

2) A test section of the llanzlan- 
ate was to be converted at once to a 
completely authentic Fenachrone en- 
vironment. 

3) Every possible precaution was 
to be taken that no Fenachrone suf- 
fered any ill effects on the way, dur- 
ing transfer to their new quarters, or 
while in their new quarters. 



Dropping the Fenachrone flagship 
and its personnel from his mind, 
Klazmon immersed himself in 
thought. 

He had learned much. There was 
much more of menace than he had 
supposed, in many galaxies other 
than Galaxy DW-427-LU ... es- 
pecially that so-called First Galaxy 
. and particularly the Green Sys- 
tem or Central System of that gal- 
axy? The green-skinned Norlamin- 
ians — how of them? And how of 
that system’s overlord, * Seaton of 
Tellus? That one was, very evident- 
ly, a Jelm . and, even after mak- 
ing all due allowance for Sleemet’s 
bias, he was of a completely uncon- 
trolled and therefore extremely dan- 
gerous type. 

And as, evidently, his was a mind 
of exceeding power, he could very 
well be a very dangerous and quite 
immediate threat. 

The mergons must be wider-spread 
even than originally planned and 
they must be on the lookout for this 
Overlord Seaton. In fact, he might 
be worth interviewing personally. 
It might be well worth while, some of 
these years, to take some time off 
and go to that distant galaxy, pur- 
posely to make that Jelm Seaton’s 
acquaintance . 

Shrugging his shoulders and shak- 
ing both wings, Klazmon cut off his 
projection and called another meet- 
ing of his Board of Advisors. 

He briefed them on what had 
happened; then went on: 

“We must protect all our planets 
in the same way and to the same ex- 
tent that this planet Llurdiax is pro- 
tected now: a course of action now 



38 



IF 





necessary because of these many 
Jelman and Jelmoid races that have 
been developing for untold millenia 
m their unsane and illogical ways, 
with no semblance of or attempt at 
either guidance or control. 

“Second: any force of any such 
race that attacks us will be destroyed 
before it or they can do us any harm. 

“Third: the manufacture and dis- 
tribution of mergons will continue 
indefinitely at the present rate. 

“Fourth: No chance or casual ves- 
sel or fleet traversing any part of 
the vast volume of space to be cov- 
ered by our mergons is to be de- 
stroyed, or even hailed, until I my- 
self decide what action, if any, is to 
be taken.” 

So saying, the Llanzlan Klazmon 
dismissed his advisors. His great 
wings fanned idly as he contemplated 
what he had done. He was well 
pleased with it He had, he reflected, 
scratching his head contentedly with 
the tip of his tail, provided for every 
possible contingency. Whatever this 
Jelm, or Jelmlike creature, named 
Seaton might be or do, he would 
pose no real threat to the llanzlan&te. 

Of that Klazmon was one hundred 
per cent sure . 

And wrong! 

\ 

VI 

Of Disembodied Intelligences 

W e have now seen how the ripple 
of thought that began with the 
conference between Seaton and his 
advisors from the Green System had 
spread throughout all of recorded 
space, and how it had affected the 



SKYLARK DUQUESNE 



lives and destinies of countless mil- 
lions of persons who had never heard 
of him. 

Yet a few threads remain to be 
drawn into our net. And one of 
these threads represents the strangest 
entities Seaton had encountered, 
ever ... as well as the most deadly. 

To understand what these entities 
are like, it is necessary to look back 
to their beginnings. 

These are most remote, both in 
apace and in time. In a solar system 
ao distant from that of Sol as to be 
forever unknowable to any one of 
Earth, and at a time an inconceiv- 
ably vast number of millenia in the 
past, there once existed a lusty and 
fertile Tellus-type planet named Mar- 
ghol. Over the usual millions of 
years mankind evolved on Marghol 
and thrived as usual. And finally, 
also as usual and according to the 
scheduled fate of all created mater- 
ial things, the planet Marghol grew 
old. 

Whether or not a Tellus-Type 
planet ordinarily becomes unfit to 
support human life before its sun 
goes nova is not surely known. Nor 
does it matter very much; for, long 
before either event occurs, the hu- 
man race involved has developed a 
faster-than-light drive and has at its 
disposal dozens or hundreds of 
Earth-like .planets upon which even 
subhuman life has not yet developed. 
The. planet Marghol, however, while 
following the usual pattern in gen- 
eral, developed a specific thing that 
was, as far as is known, unique 
throughout all the reaches of total 
apace and throughout all time up to 
the present 



On Marghol, during many, many 
millions of years of its prime, there 
had continued to exist a small, tight- 
ly-inbred, self-perpetuating cult of 
thinkers — of men and women who 
devoted their every effort and their 
total power to thought. 

They themselves did not know 
what freak of mind or quirk of phy- 
sical environment made the ultimate 
outcome possible; but after those 
many millions of years, during which 
the perpetually imbreeding group 
grew stronger and stronger mentally 
and weaker and weaker physically, 
the seven survivors of the group suc- 
ceeded finally in liberating their 
minds — minds perfectly intact and 
perfectly functioning — from the gross 
and perishable flesh of their physical 
bodies. 

Then, able to travel at the unmeas- 
urable speed of thought and with all 
future time in which to work, they 
set out to learn everything there was 
to know. They would learn, they de- 
clared, not only all about space and 
time and zero and infinity and ani- 
mals and people and life and death, 
but also anything and everything 
and everything else comprising or 
having anything to do with the total- 
ity of existence that is the Cosmic 
All. 

This quest for knowledge has been 
going on, through universe after uni- 
verse and through dimension after 
dimension, for a stretch of time that, 
given as a number in Tellurian years, 
would be a number utterly incom- 
prehensible to the human mind. For 
— what perceptible or tangible dif- 
ference is there, to the human mind, 
between a googolplex of seconds and 



40 



IF 




the same number of centuries? And, 
since these free minds ordinarily 
kept track of time only by the life- 
cycles of suns, the period of time 
during which they had already trav- 
eled and studied could have been 
either shorter or longer than either 
of the two exact figures mentioned. 

Seven free minds had left the 
planet Marghol. They called them- 
selves, in lieu of names, “One” to 
“Seven” in order of their liberation. 

For a brief time — a mere cosmic 
eye-wink; a few hundreds of millions 
of years — there had been eight, since 
One had consented to dematerialize 
one applicant for immortality. The 
applicant Eight, however, sick and 
tired of eternal life, had committed 
suicide by smashing his sixth-order 
being out of existence against Rich- 
ard Seaton’s sixth-order screens. 

Now those seven free minds, ac- 
companied by the free mind of Im- 
mortality Candidate Doctor Marc 
C. DuQuesne, were flying through 
ultra-deep space in a time-stasis cap- 
sule. This capsule, as has been said, 
was designed and powered to travel 
almost to infinity in both space and 
time. But, as the Norlaminians point- 
ed out to Seaton, his basic assump- 
tions were invalid. 

Nothing happened, however, for 
week after week. Then, so immense- 
ly far out in intergalactic space that 
even the vast bulk of a galaxy lying 
there would have been invisible even 
to Palomar’s “Long Eye”, the hurt- 
ling capsule struck a cloud of hydro- 
gen gas. 

T hat gas was, by Earthly stand- 
ards, a hard vacuum; but the 



capsule’s velocity by that time was 
so immensely great that that cloud 
might just as well have been a moun- 
tain of solid rock. The capsule’s di- 
rectors tried, with all their prodig- 
ious might and speed, to avoid the 
obstruction, but even with fullest 
power they did not have time enough. 

Eight multi-ton power-bars of ac- 
tivated uranium flared practically in- 
stantaneously into ragingly incan- 
descent gas; into molecular, atomic, 
and subatomic vapor and debris. A 
fireball brighter than a sun glared 
briefly; then nothing whatever was 
visible where that massive structure 
had been. 

And out of that sheer emptiness 
came a cold, clear thought: the 

thought of Doctor Marc C. Du- 
Quesne. 

“One, are you familiar enough 
with this region of space to estimate 
at all dosely how long we were in 
that stasis of time and where we 
now are with reference to the First 
Galaxy?” 

Freemind One did not exactly an- 
swer the question. “What matters 
it?” he asked. If the thought of aa 
immortal and already incredibly old 
and incredibly knowledgeful mind 
can be said to show surprise, that, 
thought did. “It should be clear, even 
to you of infinitesimally short life, 
that any length of time expressible 
in any finite number of definite time 
periods is actually but a moment 
Also, the Cosmic All is vast indeed; 
larger by many orders of magnitude 
than any that the boldest of your 
thinkers has as yet dared to imagine. 

“Whether or not space is infinite 
I do not know. Whether or not my 



SKYLARK DUQUESNE 



41 




life span will be infinite I do not 
know. I do not as yet completely un- 
derstand infinity. I do know, how- 
ever, that both infinite time and in- 
finite space are requisite for the ac- 
quisition of infinite knowledge, 
which is my goal; wherefore I am 
well content. You have no valid 
reason whatever for wishing to re- 
turn to your Earth. Instead, you 
should be as eager as I am to ex- 
plore and to study the as yet un- 
known.” 

“I have unfinished business there.” 
DuQuesne’s thought was icy cold. 
“I’m going back there whether you 
do or not.” 

“To kill beings who have at best 
but an instant to live? To rule an 
ultra-microscopic speck of cosmic 
dust? A speck whose fleeting exis- 
tence is of but infinitesimal impor- 
tance to the Great Scheme of Things? 
Are you still infantile enough, de- 
spite your recent transformation, to 
regard as valid such indefensible 
reasons as those?” 

“They’re valid enough to me. And 
you’d have to go back, too, I should 
think. Or isn’t it still true that science 
demands the dematerialization of the 
whole Skylark party?” 

“Truth is variable,” One said. 
“Thus, while certain of our remarks 
were not true in the smaller aspect, 
each of them was designed to elicit 
a larger truth. They aided in the in- 
itiation of chains of events by ob- 
servation of which I will be able to 
fit many more constituent parts of 
this you call the First Universe pre- 
cisely into place in the Great 
Scheme. 

“Now as to you, DuQuesne. The 



probability was small that you were 
sufficiently advanced to become a 
worthy member of our group; but I 
decided to give you your chance and 
permitted Richard Seaton to do 
what he did. As a matter of fact I, 
not Seaton, did it. You have failed; 
and I now know that no member of 
your race can ever become a true 
Scholar. In a very few millions of 
your years you would not be think- 
ing of knowledge at all, but merely 
of self-destruction. I erred, one-tenth 
of a cycle since, in admitting Free- 
mind Eight to our study group; an 
entity who was then at approximate- 
ly the same stage of development as 
you now are. I will not repeat that 
error. You will be rematerialized and 
will be allowed to do whatever you 
please.” 

The mind of DuQuesne almost 
gasped. 

“Out here? Even if you recreate 
my ship I’d never get back!” 

“You should and will have pre- 
cisely the same chance as before of 
living out your normal instant of 
life in normal fashion. To that end 
I will construct for you a vessel that 
will be the replica of your former 
one except in that it will have a sixth- 
order drive — what your fellow-hu- 
man Seaton called the ‘Cosmic En- 
ergy’ drive — so that you will be able 
to make the journey in comparatively 
few of your days. I will instruct you 
in this drive and in certain other 
matter* that will be required to im- 
plement what I have said. I will set 
your vessel’s controls upon your 
home galaxy at the correct acceler- 
ation. 

“I compute ... I construct.”

IF 




A nd faster by far than even an 
electronic eye could follow, a 
pattern of incredibly complex stresses 
formed in the empty other. 

Elemental particles, combining in- 
stantaneously, built practically instan- 
taneously upward through electrons 
and protons and atoms and mole- 
cules beams and weaponry up to a 
million tons or more of perfectly- 
operating superdreadnought — and at 
the same time built the vastly more 
complex structure of the two hun- 
dred pounds or so of meat and so 
forth that were to enclothe Freemind 
DuQuesne — and did the whole job in 
much less time than the blink of an 
eye. 

“. I instruct ... It is done,” 
and all seven freeminds vanished. 

And DuQuesne, seated at a thor- 
oughly familiar controlboard and 
feeling normal gravity on the seat of 
his pants, stared at that board’s in- 
struments, for a moment stunned. 

According to those instruments the 
Aip was actually travelling at an 
acceleration of one hundred twenty- 
eeven lights; its internal gravity was 
actually nine hundred eighty-one 
point zero six centimeters per sec- 
ond squared. 

He stared around the entire room, 
examining minutely each familiar 
object. Activating a visiplate, he 
•canned the immense skyrover, in- 
side and out, from stem to stem: 
finding that it was in fact, except for 
the stated improvements, an exact 
duplicate of the mighty ship of war 
he had formerly owned: which, he 
•tQl thought, had been one of the 
most powerful battleships ever built 
by man. 



Then, and only then, did he ex- 
amine the hands resting, quiescent 
but instantly ready, upon the board’s 
flat, bare table. They were big 
tanned, powerful hands; with long, 
strong, tapering, highly competent 
fingers. They were his hands — his 
own hands in every particular, clear 
down to the tiny scar on the side of 
his left index finger, where, years 
before, a bit of flying glass from an 
exploding flask had left its mark. 

Shaking his head, he got up and 
went to his private cabin, where he 
strode up to a full-length mirror. 

The man who stared back at him 
out of it was tall and powerfully 
built; with thick, slightly wavy hair 
of an intense, glossy black. The eyes, 
only a trifle lighter in shade, were 
surmounted by heavy black eye- 
brows growing together above his 
finely-chiseled aquiline beak of a 
nose. His saturnine face, while ac- 
tually tanned, looked almost pale be- 
cause of the blackness of the heavy 
beard always showing through, even 
after the closest possible shave. 

“He could rematerialize me per- 
fectly — and did,” he said aloud to 
himself, “and the whole ship — ex- 
actly!” 

Scowling in concentration, he went 
into his bathroom and stepped upon 
the platform of his weight-and-height 
Fafrbanks. Six feet and seven-eighths 
of an inch. Precisely right. Two hun- 
dred two and three-quarters pounds. 
Ditto. 

He examined the various items of 
equipment and of every-day use. 
There was his cutthroat razor, 
Osnomian-made of arenak — vastly 
sharper than any Earthly razor

could possibly be honed and so in- 
credibly hard that it could shave 
generation after generation of men 
with no loss whatever of edge. 

Comb, brush, toothbrush, lotion 
— inside the drawers and out — every 
item was exactly as he had left it 
. clear down to the correctly- 
printed, peculiarly-distorted tubes of 
tooth-paste and of shaving cream; 
each of which, when he picked it up, 
fitted perfectly into the grip of his 
left hand. 

“I’ll . be . totally . 
damned,” DuQuesne said then, 
aloud.

DuQuesne and Klazmon 

T he Skylark of Valeron swung in 
orbit around the sun of Earth. 
She was much more of worldlet than 
a spaceship, being a perfect sphere 
over a thousand kilometers in diam- 
eter. She had to be big. She had to 
house, among other things, the one- 
thousand-kilometers-diameter grad- 
uated circles of declination and of 
right ascension required to chart the 
thousands of millions of galaxies 
making up any given universe of the 
Cosmic All. 

She was for the most part cold and 
dark. Even the master-control hel- 
mets, sprouting masses and mazes 
of thigh-thick-bundles of hair-thin 
silver wire, hung inactivated in the 
neutral gray, featureless master-con- 
trol room. The giant computer, how- 
ever — the cubic mile of ultra-min- 
iaturization that everyone called the 
“Brain” — was still in operation; 



and in the worldlet's miles-wida 
chart-room, called the “tank”, there 
still glowed the enormous lenticular 
aggregation of points of light that 
was the chart of the First Universe 
— each tiny point of light repre- 
senting a galaxy composed o # 
thousands of millions of solar sys- 
tems. 

A precisely coded thought im- 
pinged upon a receptor. 

A relay clicked, whereupon a 
neighboring instrument, noting the 
passage of current through its vitals, 
went busity but silently to work, 
and an entire panel of instrumenta- 
tion came to life 

Switch after switch snapped home. 
Field after field of time-stasis col- 
lapsed. The planetoid’s artificial sun 
resumed its shining; breezes began 
again to stir the leaves of trees and 
of shrubbery; insects resumed their 
flitting from bloom to once-more- 
scented bloom. Worms resumed their 
gnawings and borings beneath the 
green velvet carpets that were the 
lawns. Brooks began again to flow; 
gurglingly. Birds took up their carol- 
ing and chirping and twittering pre- 
cisely where they had left off so 
long before; and three houses — 
there was a house now for Shiro 
and his bride of a month — be- 
came comfortably warm and softly, 
invitingly livable. 

All that activity meant, of course, 
that the Seaton-Crane party would 
soon be coming aboard. 

They were in fact already on the 
way, in Skylark Two; the forty-foot 
globe which, made originally of 
Osnomian arenak and the only space- 
ship they owned, had been “flashed 




over” into ultra-refractory inoson 
and now served as Captain’s gig, pin- 
aace, dinghy, lifeboat, landing craft, 
and so forth — whatever any of the 
party wanted her to do. There were 
many other craft aboard the Skylark 
of Valeron, of course, of various 
shapes and sizes; but Two had al- 
ways been the Seatons’ favorite 
“small boat”. 

As Two approached the Valeron , 
directly in line with one of her huge 
main ports, Seaton slowed down to 
a dawdling crawl — a mere handful 
of miles per second — and thought 
into a helmet already on his head; 
and the massive gates of locks — 
of a miles-long succession of locks 
Arough the immensely thick skin of 
Ae planetoid — opened in front of 
flying Two and closed behind her. 
Clearing the last gate, Seaton put 
on a gee and a half of deceleration 
and brought the little flying sphere 
down to a soft and easy landing in 
her berth in the back yard of the 
Seatons’ house. 

E ight people disembarked; five of 
whom were the three Seatons 
and Martin ^ and Margaret Crane. 
(Infant Lucile Crane rode joyously 
on her moAer’s left hip.) Seventh 
was short, chunky, lightning-fast 
Shiro, whose place in these Skylark 
annals has not been small. Orig- 
inally Crane’s “man”, he had long 
since become Crane’s firm friend; 
and he was now as much of a Sky- 
larker as was any of the others. 

Eighth was Lotus Blossom, Shiro’s 
small, finely wrought, San Fran- 
cisco-born and western-dressed bride, 
whom the others had met only that 



morning, just before leaving Earth. 
She looked like a living doll — 
but appearances can be so deceiving! 
She was in fact one of Ae most pro- 
ficient female experts in unarmed 
combat Aen alive. 

“Our house first, please, all of 
you,” DoroAy said. “We’ll eat be- 
fore we do one single solitary thing 
else. I could eat Aat fabled mission- 
ary from the plains of Timbuctoo.” 
Margaret laughed. “Hat and gown 
and hymnbook too,” she finished. 
“Me, too, Dick.” 

“Okay by me; I could toy with 
a couple of morsels myself,” Seaton 
said, and pencils of force wafted 
Ae eight into Ae roomy kitchen 
of the house that was in almost 
every detail an exact duplicate of 
Ae Seatons’ home on Earth. “You’re 
Ae chief kitchen mechanic, Red- 
Top; strut your stuff.” 

Dorothy looked at and thought 
into the controller — she no longer 
had to wear any of Ae limited-con- 
trol headsets to operate them — 
and a damask-clothed table, set for 
six, laden wiA a wide variety of 
food and equipped with six carved 
oak chairs and two high-chairs, 
came instantly into being in Ae 
middle of Ae room. 

The Nisei girl jumped violently; 
then smiled apologetically. “Shiro 
told me about such things, but . 
well, maybe I’ll get used to them 
sometimes I hope.” 

“Sure you will, Lotus,” Seaton 
assured her. “It’s pretty weird at first, 
but you get used to it fast.” 

“I sincerely hope so,” Lotus said, 
and eyed the six dinner places 
dubiously. She had Aought that she

was thoroughly American, but she 
wasn’t quite. Traditions are strong. 
With an IQ that a Heidelberg stu- 
dent might envy, part of the crew of 
the most powerful vehicle man had 
ever seen, full, educated and trained 
. it was evident that Shiro’s dainty 
little bride was more than a little 
doubtful about sitting at that table. 

Until Dorothy took her by the 
hand and sat her down. “This is 
where 1 like my friends to sit,” she 
announced. “Where I can see them.” 

A flush dyed the porcelain-like 
perfection of Lotus’s skin. “I thank 
you, Mrs. — ” 

“Friends, remember?” Seaton 
broke in “Call her Dot. Now let’s 
eat!” 

hereafter, they worked. 

It may be wondered, among 
those historians not familiar with 
the saga of the Skylarks, why so 
much consternation and trouble 
should come from so small an event 
as the probabilistic speculation of a 
single Norlaminian sage that one 
mere human body, lately cast into 
the energy forms of the disembodied 
intelligences, might soon return into 
the universe in a viable form. 

Such historians do not, of course, 
know Blackie DuQuesne. 

While Seaton, Crane and the oth- 
ers were .eating their meal, across 
distances to be measured in gjgapar- 
secs, countless millions of persons 
were in one way or another busy at 
work on projects central to their own 
central concern. Seaton and Crane 
were not idle. They were waiting for 
further information . and at the 
same time, refurbishing the inner 



man with food, with rest and with 
pleasant company; but an hour later, 
after dinner, after the table and ha 
appurtenances had vanished and the 
three couples were seated in the 
living room, more or less facing the 
fire, Seaton stoked up his battered 
black briar and Crane lighted one o l 
his specially made cigarettes. 

“Well?” Seaton demanded then. 
“Have you thunk up anything you 
think is worth two tinker’s whoops in 
Hades?” 

Crane smiled ruefully. “Not more 
than one, I’d say — if that many. 
Let’s consider that thought or mes- 
sage that Carfon is sending out 
It will be received, he says, only by 
persons or entities who not only 
know more than we do about one 
or more specific things, but also are 
friendly enough to be willing to share 
their knowledge with us. And to 
make the matter murkier, we have 
no idea either of what it is that we 
lack or of what it, whatever it is, is 
supposed to be able to do. Therefore 
Point One would be: how are they 
going to get in touch with us? By 
what you called magic?” 

Seaton did not answer at first, then 
only nodded. “Magic” was still a 
much less than real concept to him. 
He said, “If you say so — but re- 
member the Peruvian Indian medi- 
cine-men and the cinchona bark 
that just happened to be full of 
quinine. So, whatever you want to 
call it — magic or extra-sensory 
perception or an unknown band of 
the sixth or what-have-you — I’ll 
bet my last shirt it’ll be bio. And 
whoever pitches it at us will be good 
enough at it to know that they can

IF 




hit us with it, so all we have to do 
about that is wait for it to happen. 
However, what I’m mostly interested 
in right now is nothing that far out, 
but what we know that a reincar- 
nated Blackie DuQuesne could and 
probably would do.” 

“Such as?” 

“The first thing he’ll do, for all 
the tea in China, will be to design 
and set up some gadget or gizmo or 
technique to kill me with. Certain- 
ly me, and probably you, and quite 
possibly all of us.” 

Dorothy and Margaret both gasp- 
ed; but Crane nodded and said, 
“Check. 1 check you to your pro- 
verbial nineteen decimals. Also, and 
quite possibly along with that opera- 
tion, an all-out attempt to reconquer 
Earth. He wouldn’t set out to destroy 
Earth, at this time, at least . 
would he, do you think?” 

Seaton thought for seconds, then 
said, “My best guess would be no. 
He wants to boss it, not wipe it out. 
However, there are a few other 
things that might come . .” 
“Wait up, presh!” Dorothy 
snapped. “Those two will hold us 
for a while; especially the first one. 
I wish to go on record at this point 
to the effect that I want my husband 
alive , not dead.” 

Seaton grinned. “You and me 
both, pet,” he said. “I’m in favor 
of it. Definitely. However, as long 
as I stay inside the Valeron here he 
doesn’t stand the chance of a snow- 
flake in you-know- where of getting 
at me . .” 

How wrong Seaton was! 

“. so the second point is the 
one that’s really of over-riding im- 



portance. The rub is that we can’t 
make even a wild guess at when he’* 
going to get loose ... He could be 
building his ship right now ... so. 
Engineer Martin Crane, what’s your 
thought as to defending Earth; as 
adequately as possible but in the 
shortest possible time?” 

C rane inhaled — slowly — a deep 
lungful of smoke, exhaled it 
even more slowly, and stubbed out 
the butt. “That’s a tall order, Dick," 
he said, finally, “but I don’t think 
it’s hopeless. Since we know Du- 
Quesne’s exact line of departure, we 
know at least approximately the line 
of his return. As a first-approxima- 
tion idea we should, I think, cover 
that line thoroughly with hair-trig- 
gered automation. We should occupy 
the fourth and the fifth completely; 
thus taking care of everything we 
know that he knows . but as for 
the sixth . .” Crane paused in 
thought. 

“Yeah,” Seaton agreed. “That 
sixth order’s an entirely different 
breed of cats. If* a pistol — a 
question with a capital Q. About all 
we can do on it, I’d say, is cover 
everything we know of it and then 
set up supersensitive analsynths 
coupled to all the automatic con- 
structors and such-like gizmos we 
can dream up — with as big a gaggle 
of ground-and-lofty dreamers as we 
can round up. The Norlaminians, 
certainly; and Sacner Carfon for 
sure. If what he and Drasnik pulled 
off wasn’t magic it certainly was a 
remarkably reasonable facsimile 
thereof. All six of us, of course, 
and . 



47 




“But what can you possibly want 
of us?” Shiro asked, and Dorothy 
said, “That goes double for Peggy 
and me, Dick. Of what good could 
we two possibly be, thinking about 
such stuff as that?” 

Seaton flushed. “ ‘Scuse, please; 
my error. I switched thinking with- 
out announcing the switch. I do 
know, though, that our minds all 
work differently — especially 
Shiro’s and double-especially Lotus’s 

— and that when you don’t have 
the faintest glimmering of what 
you’re getting into you don’t know 
what you’re going to have to have 
to cope with it.” He grinned. 

“If you can untangle that, I 
mean,” he said. 

“I think so,” said Crane, unruffled; 
he had had long practice in follow- 
ing Seaton’s lightning leaps past syn- 
tax. “And you think that this will 
enable us to deal with DuQuesne?” 
“It’ll have to,” Seaton said posi- 
tively. “One thing we know, some- 
thing has to. He’s not going to send 
us a polite message asking to be 
friends — he’s going to hit with all 
he’s got. So,” he finished, “let’s hop 
to it. The Norlaminian observers’ re- 
ports are piling up on the tapes right 
now. And we’d all better keep our 
eyes peeled — as well as all the 
rest of our senses and instruments! 

— for Doctor Marc C. Blackie Du- 
Quesne!” 

A nd DuQuesne, so immensely far 
out in intergalactic space, at 
control board and computer, ex- 
plored for ten solid hours the vast- 
nesses of his new knowledge. 

Then he donned a thought-helmet 



and thought himsdf up a snack; 
after eating which — scarcely tast- 
ing any part of it — he put in 
another ten solid hours of work. 
Then, leaning back in his form-fit- 
ting seat, he immersed himself in 
thought — and, being corporeal, no 
longer a pattern of pure force, went 
sound asleep. 

He woke up a couple of hours 
later; stiff, groggy, and ravenous. 
He thought himself up a supper of 
steak and mushrooms, hashed 
browns, spinach, coffee, and apple 
pie a la'' mode. He ate it — with 
zest, this time — then sought his 
long-overdue bed. 

In the morning, after a shower 
and a shave and a breakfast of crisp 
bacon and over-easy eggs, toast and 
butter and marmalade, and four 
cups of strong, black coffee, he sat 
down at his board and again went 
deep into thought. This time, he 
thought in words and sentences, the 
better to nail down his conclusions. 

“One said I’d have precisely the 
same chance as before of living out 
my normal lifetime. Before what? 
Before the dematerialization or be- 
fore Seaton got all that extra stuff? 
Since he gave me sixth order drive, 
offense, defense, and communica- 
tions, he could have — probably 
did — put me on a basis of equality 
with Seaton as of now. Would he 
have given me any more than that?” 

DuQuesne paused and worked for 
ten busy minutes at computer and 
control board again. What he learn- 
ed was in the form of curves and 
quantities, not words; he did not at- 
tempt to speak them aloud, but sat 
staring into space. 



48 



IF 




Then, satisfied that the probabili- 
ties were adequate to base a plan 
on, he spoke out loud again: “No. 
Why should he give me everything 
that Seaton’s got? He didn’t owe me 
anything.” To Blackie DuQuesne 
that was not a rueful complaint but 
a statement of fact. He went on. 
"Assume we both now have a rela- 
tively small part of the spectrum of 
the sixth-order forces, if I keep 
using this drive — Ouch! What the 
living hell was thatl ” 

DuQuesne leaped to his feet. 
"That” had been a sixth-order probe, 
at the touch of which his vessel’s 
every course of defensive screen had 
flared into action. 

D uQuesne was not shaken, no. 

But he was surprised, and he 
didn’t like to be surprised. There 
should have been no probes out 
here! 

The probe had been cut off al- 
most instantaneously; but “almost” 
instantaneously is not quite zero 
time, and sixth-order forces operate 
at the speed of thought. Hence, in 
that not-quite-zero instant of time 
during which the intruding mind had 
been in contact with his own, Du- 
Quesne learned a little. The crea- 
ture was undoubtedly highly intelli- 
gent — and, as undoubtedly, unhu- 
man to the point of monstrosity . 
and DuQuesne had no doubt what- 
ever in his own mind that the alien 
would think the same of any Tellur- 
ian. 

DuQuesne studied his board and 
•aw, much to his surprise, that only 
one instrument showed any drain 
at all above maintenance level, and 



that one was a m////ammeter — the 
needle of which was steady on the 
scale at a reading of one point three 
seven milsl He was not being attack- 
ed at all — merely being observed 

— and by an observation system that 
was using practically no power at 
all! 

Donning a helmet, so as to be 
able himself to operafe at the speed 
of thought, DuQuesne began — very 
skittishly and very gingerly indeed 

— to soften down his spheres and 
zones and shells and solid fields of 
defensive force. He softened and 
softened them down; down to the 
point at which a working projection 
could come through and work. 

And a working projection came 
through. 

No one of Marc C. DuQuesne’s 
acquaintances, friend or enemy, had 
ever said that he was any part of 
either a weakling or a coward. The 
consensus was that he was harder 
than the ultra-refractory hubs of hell 
itself. Nevertheless, when the simu- 
lacrum of Llanzlan Klazmon the 
Fifteenth of the Realm of the Llurdi 
came up to within three feet of him 
and waggled one gnarled forefinger 
at the helmets of a mechanical edu- 
cator, even DuQuesne’s burly spirit 
began to quail a little — but he was 
strong enough and hard enough not 
to let any sign show. 

With every mind-block he owned 
set hard, DuQuesne donned a head- 
set and handed its mate to his visi- 
tor. He engaged that monstrous alien 
mind to mind. Then, releasing his 
blocks, he sent the Llurdi a hard, 
cold, sharp, diamond-clear — and 
lying! — thought: 



SKYLARK DUQUESNE 



49 




“Yes? Who are you, pray, and 
what, to obtrude your uninvited 
presence upon me, Foalang Kassi a* 
Doompf, the Highest Imperial of 
the Drailsen Quadrant?” 

This approach was, of course, the 
natural one for DuQuesne to make; 
he did not believe in giving away 
truth when lies might be so much 
cheaper — and less dangerous. It 
was equally of course the worst pos- 
sible approach to Klazmon: reen- 
forcing as it did every unfavorable 
idea the Llurd had already formed 
from his lightning-fast preliminary 
once-over-lightly of the man and of 
the man’s tremendous spaceship. 

Klazmon did not think back at 
DuQuesne directly. Instead, he 
thought to himself and, as DuQuesne 
knew, for the record; thoughts that 
the Earthman could read like print. 

To the Llurd, DuQuesne was a 
peculiarly and repulsively obnoxious 
monstrosity. Physically a Jelm, he 
belonged to a race of Jelmi that had 
never been subjected to any kind of 
logical, sensible, or even intelligent 
control. 

Klazmon then thought at Du- 
Quesne; comparing him with Mer- 
gon and Luloy on the one hand and 
with Sleemet of the Fenachrone on 
the other — and deciding that all 
three races were basically the same. 
The Llurd showed neither hatred 
nor detestation; he was merely con- 
temptuous, intolerant, and utterly 
logical. “Like the few remaining 
Fenachrone and the rebel faction 
of our own Jelmi and the people 
you think of as the Chlorans, your 
race is, definitely, surplus popula- 
tion; a nuisance that must be and 



shall be abated. Where — ” Klazmon 
suddenly drove a thought — »“is the 
Drailsen Quadrant?” 

DuQuesne, however, was not to 
be caught napping. His blocks held. 
“You’ll never know,” he sneered. 
“Any task-force of yours that ever 
comes anywhere near us will not 
last long enough to energize a sixth- 
order communicator.” 

“That’s an idle boast,” Klazmon 
stated thoughtfully. “It is true that 
you and your vessel are far out of 
range of any possible Llurdiaxian 
attacking beam. Even this projection 
of me is being relayed through four 
mergons. Nevertheless we can and 
we will find you easily when this 
becomes desirable. This point will 
be reached as soon as we have com- 
puted the most logical course to take 
in exterminating all such surplus 
races as yours.” 

And Klazmon’s projection van- 
ished; and the helmet he had been 
wearing fell toward the floor. 

D uQuesne was shocked as he had 
never been shocked before; 
and when he learned from his an- 
alsynths just what the range of one 
of those incredible “mergons” was, 
he was starkly appalled. 

One thing was crystal-clear: He 
was up against some truly first-class 
opposition here. And it had just 
stated, calmly and definitely, that 
its intention was to exterminate him, 
Blackie DuQuesne. 

The master of lies had learned to 
assess the value of a truth very 
precisely. He knew this one to be 
22-karat, crystal-clear, pure quill. 
Whereupon Blackie DuQuesne turn- 



50 



IF 




ed to some very intensive thought in- 
deed, compared with which his pre- 
vious efforts might have been no 
more than a summer afternoon’s re- 
verie. 

We know now, of course, that 
Blackie DuQuesne lacked major ele- 
ments of information, and that his 
constructions could not therefore be 
complete. They lacked Norlaminian 
rigor, or the total visualization of his 
late companions, the disembodied in- 
tellectuals. And they lacked infor- 
mation. 

DuQuesne knew nothing of Mer- 
gon and Luloy, now inward bound 
on Earth in a hideout orbit. He 
could not guess how his late visitor 
had ever heard of the Fenachrone. 
Nor knew he anything of that strange 
band of the sixth order to which 
Seaton referred, with more than half 
a worried frown, as “magic”. In 
short, DuQuesne was attempting to 
reach the greatest conclusion of his 
life through less than perfect means, 
with only fragmentary facts to go 
on. 

Nevertheless, Blackie C. DuQues- 



ne, as Seaton was wont to de- 
clare, was no slouch at figuring; and 
so he did in time come to a plan 
which was perhaps the most brilliant 
— and also was perhaps the most 
witless! — of his career. 

Lips curled into something much 
more sneer than grin, DuQuesne sat 
down at his construction board. He 
had come to the conclusion that 
what he needed was help, and he 
knew exactly where to go to get it 
His ship wasn’t big enough by far 
to hold a sixth-order projection 
across any important distance . 
but he could build, in less than an 
hour, a sixth-order broadcaster. It 
wouldn’t be selective. It would be 
enormously wasteful of power. But 
it would carry a signal across half 
a universe. 

Whereupon, in less than an hour, 
a signal began to pour out, into and 
through space: 

“DuQuesne calling Seaton! Reply 
on tight beam of the sixth. Du- 
Quesne calling Seaton! Reply on tight 
beam of the sixth. DuQuesne calling 
Seaton . .”

A s he was unaccustomed to being 
interrupted in the middle of a 
massage session, even by so exalted 
a personage as Base Commandant 
Henly, Nestil Lagotilom lifted his 
eight-foot reptilian form from the 
massage table, dismissed his mas- 
seur, and swore vigorously about 
bureaucrats. Then, glaring balefully 
at the Official Messenger, or Mer- 
cury, he told the emissary to tell 
Henly he’d report to his office in a 
few minutes. The Mercury snapped a 
smart salute and left. Lagotilom pull- 
ed on a faded gray Harvard sweater 
that was at least a thousand years

old, a webbing belt with a long, drag- 
ging, red leather holster on it and a 
large gun in the holster, and a black 
beret, which he perched rakishly atop 
his basketball-sized cranium. He 
struck a pose before a mirror, cor- 
rected his belt’s carriage, and left. 

Commandant Herbert Washington 
Henly had unusual tastes in offices. 
When he had been given command 
of the Keeler’s World Star Naval 
Base, he converted the neat, conser- 
vative, sunlit office that had served 
two hundred former commandants 
into a red, uterine chamber encircled 
by a spiral corridor that led to a 
similar waiting room, done in blue. 
He liked it, but the base economists 



52 




jumped on his desk immediately and 
raised hell about large sums on slips 
of pink paper. Heniy had told them 
all to go to the Naval Bank with 
their problems, figuring that the red 
tape they’d get entangled in there 
would keep them out of his hair for 
years. In the meantime, he had 
drawn on naval sums to fill the of- 
fice with soft stuffed leather furni- 
ture built on alleged Hrillan designs 
and enough comfort-producing de- 
vices to make the office look like 
the site of the mad tea party. 

When his desk intercom buzzed 
he had to crawl over sundry pieces 
of ironmongery that his interior 
decorator had said were out of the 
way, hide his putter and golf balls, 
and struggle into his seat before he 
could answer it. The intercom’s 
screen showed his young human sec- 
retary, Myra Corning, whose face 
was twisted into a sort of distasteful 
frightened expression. She opened 
her mouth as if to speak, cast her 
eyes at something beyond his field 
of vision, and spoke. 

“Ummm . Lieutenant Lagoti- 
lom is here, sir. Shall I send him 
in?” 

Heniy glanced at his appointment 
list, found Lagodlom’s name, glanoed 
at the ivory dragon’s tooth with the 
clock in it, and replied, “Yes. Send 
him in. And if he has his gun, check 
it for him. I know he hates to part 
from it, but it’s regulations. Thanks.” 

Heniy relaxed a few seconds, then 
glanced at the sphincter door of his 
office, which had opened. Lagotilom 
strode over to Henly’s desk, saluted 
unenthusiastically, and sat down on 
an ashtray pedestal that looked like 



a dragon’s paw. Heniy harumphed, 
and began. 

“Mr. Lagotilom, did the Mercury 
tell you why I had you brought down 
here?” 

“No, sir.” 

“Ummm . okay.” He riffled 
through a sheaf ot vellum papers 
clutched by a smiling varnished 
frog, and finally found the few he 
wanted. “Do you know what a 
SIMO is?” 

iC A side from it being one of those 
code names the military is 
so fond of, I don’t.” 

“Well, it’s sort of a mind trans- 
ference device. Means Subelectronic 
Integrator for the Manipulation of 
Objects.” 

“Sounds like a robot arm.” 
“Does, doesn't it?” The comman- 
dant lit a cigarette and blew a few 
smoke rings into the ventilator be- 
fore he went on. “Nothing so simple. 
I thought that's what it was at first, 
too. No, it does this. Someone puts 
a helmet on your head, and some 
soldier puts a similar one on his 
head, and the machine is turned on. 
Then your mind is duplicated in this 
soldier’s brain, his mind goes dor- 
mant until the device is shut off. 
Your original mind remains the 
same, however, so you can do what- 
ever you want while you’re connect- 
ed with the machine. The mind in 
tile soldier's body is, in essence, his 
own, born there, and is in no way 
dependent on your mind. But when 
your helmet is removed, the minds 
cease in the other heads. The over- 
all effect is that of a whole squadron 
of Nestil Lagotiloms on the field. 



SIMON SAYS

fighting with your tactical knowl- 
edge. Very clear?” 

“Like mud. Do I ever know what 
happens to those bodies?” 

“Yes. As soon as the machine is 
turned off, the memories gained re- 
vert to your original mind. I should 
think it’s help in writing reports.” 
“1 should care. I never write my 
own reports anyway. But why pick 
me?” 

“That, my dear friend, is the 
classical question. ‘Why me?’ You 
are our best military strategist for 
any base in this whole damn star 
cluster. One point for you.” The 
commandant motioned Lagotilom off 
his dragon’s paw seat, threw the cig- 
arette butt in, and continued. “And 
as a mutant, your mental pulsations 
should be far clearer and stronger 
than any nonmutant. Besides, you’re 
simple.” 

“I detest that,” Lagotilom stated. 
“I knew you would. That’s why I 
said it.” A grin split the comman- 
dant’s chubby red face, and he lit an- 
other cigarette. “Seriously, Nestil, 
you are. Granted, you do rack up in 
the supergenius bracket on IQ tests, 
but your mutant mind isn’t too com- 
plex to be packed away into a Ter- 
ran brain without a little room to 
spare. So it’s your job to give this 
thing its field tests.” 

“Umm . .sir, this . this 
SIMO sounds remarkably like that 
mental jammer I tested for the Roota 
campaign,” Lagotilom suggested 
cautiously. 

“It is. I used a jammer myself 
after it passed its tests.” 

“Well, the officials smothered 
this, but while I waa testing the 



thing, a Roota hit it with a magnetic 
blast, and it backfired. I was in a 
mental institution for three months, 
recovering from the mind erasure it 
gave me. Ever since then, I’ve been 
uneasy about testing machines that 
I’m not familiar with. And what hap- 
pens if someone using my brain gets 
killed?” 

“Nothing, except that he’s dead. 
You have a cessation of memory on 
his part when he gets killed. I doubt 
if that’ll bother you any great deal. 
Now, I’ve picked out a world for 
you to test it on.” 

“Gee, thanks,” Lagotilom mutter- 
ed leerily. 

Henly ignored the sarcasm, went 
on, “It’s in the part of the Bird cam- 
paign that’s in this cluster, and it’s 
called Meglor’s Hunk. It’s a grassy, 
mountainous clod that cooled off 
ages ago and split itself with cracks. 
These cracks have since filled in with 
water, and are very deep, narrow 
seas. Big red sun, but it looks yel- 
low through the atmosphere. Surface 
gravity, three quarters of a gee, pres- 
sure of air, 25.09 pounds per square 
inch. Natives are reptiloid, feathered 
and possessing four tentacles instead 
of arms. Size of a full-grown man.” 

T hat meant four feet, and about 
100 pounds. In the twenty third 
century, man had discovered the 
anti-evolution drugs, which kept him 
from changing his physical appear- 
ance, for the most part. However, he 
could still adapt to the worst that any 
planet could dish out, and his size 
changed. Over the following two bil- 
lion years of human civilization, he 
had grown from six feet racial size 



54 



IF 




to twelve feet, then down to two 
feet, up to eight, and finally to the 
present four feet. But since the peo- 
who lived to be old enough to 
see this were rare, the only beings 
who ever noticed it were archeolo- 
gists and historians. And enemies. 

“The Bird lines,” Henly went on, 
“are nothing but a line of disjointed 
wattle huts, rotting tents and stone 
sheds all protected by those lousy 
Bird force shields that blow fuses 
every time they’re turned on. All you 
have to do is go in and crack their 
lines, and take the planet. Got it?” 
“Vaguely.” 

“Then read this. You leave tomor- 
row at 0900.” He handed Lagotilom 
a slip of yellow paper, and fumbled 
in the frogs bowed arms for another 
thing. He drew out a buff envelope 
and handed it to Lagotilom. “Fight- 
ing plans. Don’t open them till you 
reach Meglor’s Hunk. Good luck.” 
“Yes, sir. Will that be all?” 
“Yes, Nestil. Dismissed.” 

As soon as Lagotilom was outside 
in the waiting room he tore open the 
envelope, read the top-secret plans, 
and threw them away. 

n. 

T he Li*l Abner was an old ship, 
rotted by a hundred war’s bar- 
rages and decayed by a million years 
of use. Her monocrystalline hull had 
long since ceased giving piezoelectric 
current, and even her pile was old. 
But she was dependable, and prob- 
ably would remain so for another 
ten thousand years. Having once 
been a cargoship, she was only a 
collection of rooms on four decks 



wrapped about a giant, spherical 
cargo hold. The whole arrangement 
was wrapped in shielding and mount- 
ed on a set of antiquated engines and 
told to fly. Sometimes it wouldn’t. 

This trip it carried 2,000 fighting 
men, 100 engineers, 100 crewmen, 
1 SIMO, and one Nestil Lagotilom. 

Lagotilom strode up the ship’s 
ramp into the airlock, checked his 
papers with the purser, who stamped 
the ship’s coat of arms on them, and 
went to his room. It was a fairly 
large suite, with good ventilation, 
antique furniture in excellent condi- 
tion, and a viewscreen in one wall. 

Through this Lagotilom watched 
a straddle-crane come up to the ship 
bearing a huge, black stasis box be- 
tween its spiderlike legs. The box 
probably contained the SIMO, for it 
was stamped with numerous warn- 
ings concerning the fragility of its 
contents. These were ignored; the 
box was treated like a wrecking 
mace. A few red-clad engineers stood 
nearby, watching with boredom on 
their faces. They had the silver S 
on their uniforms which identified 
them with the SIMO project, but 
they seemed not at all to care about 
their brainchild. It was dropped onto 
a conveyor belt without concern for 
its contents, and vanished from La- 
gotilom’s sight. 

Somewhat later, the old motors 
whined like whipped dogs and the 
wavering tones of the pendulum 
drive sang. As the strain was let off 
its old bones, the ship creaked, 
changed from a flattened ball to a 
near oval, and a sound like molasses 
glugging from a jug added its 
charms to the cacophony. The ship 



56 



IF 




lifted from the atmosphere in sec- 
onds, and vanished into the space- 
wrinkle of the pendulum drive. 

“Will Lieutenant Nestil Lagotilom 
please report to the machine shop in 
the cargo hold?” a female voice re- 
quested from a seascape on the wall. 
Lagotilom left and sauntered down 
two levels to the hold. A Mercury 
ushered him through a companion- 
way into the hold. 

The hold was a huge room, almost 
a perfect sphere in shape, except for 
the large, flat planes that dotted its 
floor in no particular order. Gravity 
pointed away from the center of the 
sphere so that everything clung to 
the walls. About a hundred feet 
above the floor, a girder framework 
supported ropes, block-and-tackles, 
and tracks upon which ran small or 
large winch cranes. The opposite 
floor was clearly visible, despite the 
veils of misty smoke that drifted 
about the hold. The entire room, lit 
with vast clusters of blue and yellow 
lights, smelled of the acrid fumes of 
solder. Nearby, a blond human tech- 
nician saw him and moved over his 
way. He held out his hand and flash- 
ed a grin. 

“Nestil Lagotilom? George Haps- 
burg, chief technician to that thing.” 
He jerked his thumb at a complex 
device on one of the raised flat 
planes. It was a sparkling glass globe 
supported by a shiny metal base in 
which intricate machinery was ex- 
posed. In the globe were all manners 
of spark-gaps, fan-coils, solid state 
parts and other hardware, emphasiz- 
ed by thousands of gossamer blown 
glass parts. It was almost twenty feet 
in diameter. Along the globe’s base 



were dozens of dashboards and 
screens, sparkling with lights and 
wavering lines. Atop the orb three 
glass globes reposed, antennae in 
each. As they moved around to the 
stairs that led to the platform’s top 
two more items came into view; a 
stuffed red cushion and a black, 
spidery machine standing over it. 

“So that’s the SIMO. Will it waltz? 
Umm . What’s that thing?” Lagoti- 
lom indicated the metal spider. 

tgTTTdl, Mr. Lagotilom ...” he 
▼ V started, but Lagotilom broke 
him off. 

“Lagotilom is actually my indi- 
vidual name. Nestil’ s my surname.* 

“Um . okay, Mr. Nestil. What 
you do is rest on this cushion with 
your head on this rest, and this hel- 
met is attached to your head by 
probe drills and kept there by elec- 
trode spikes.” 

“Which all means?” 

“It means we take this helmet,” 
he tapped the glassy helmet hanging 
from the spider-device’s belly, “and 
put it on your head. The tiny drill* 
it’s bristling will go directly into your 
brain and tap the necessary nerve 
centers. Then, in addition to being 
unremovable, you can get up and 
leave the machine any time you 
please.” 

“You mean I have to be perforat- 
ed so that thing can be attached to 
me?” 

“Yes. But it won’t leave marks, is 
completely painless, and will come 
off as soon as it is necessary. Now 
sit back, please.” Lagotilom sat back, 
and felt the helmet slide down onto 
his head. Hapsburg made a motion 



SIMON SAYS 



57 




at a man controlling the spider, and 
there was a sudden buzzing and Lag- 
otilom’s head itched for an instant. 
Hapsburg pulled out thin plastic 
tubes and released a few wires, then 
atepped back to survey his work. 

"It’s on now, Mr. Nestil. Now 
we’re going to test the SIMO. You 
see that guy in the red tractor on the 
girder track across the room?” 

Lagotilom nodded. 

“Fine. He’s got a helmet on. When 
we turn this thing on, you’ll be in his 
head, his body. Try moving it. How- 
ever, don’t be surprised if it doesn’t 
work.” Hapsburg left no time for 
questions. He flipped a switch, and a 
flash of pain coruscated through 
Lagotilom’s head. 

He was in a red tractor, and 
turned his head to look across the 
room. He saw his own body far 
across the room, sitting in an over- 
stuffed red cushion, talking with 
Hapsburg. His vision promptly van- 
ished. Hapsburg stood in front of 
him. “How you do feel, now. What 
did you see?” he asked. 

Lagotilom told him. 

“That's good. That’s good,” Haps- 
hurg muttered as he peered at the 
control boards and at a thin pamph- 
let “You meet all the requirements 
with flying colors,” he told Lagoti- 
lom. “Thafs nice. Take off the hel- 
met now?” ■ Lagotilom tapped the 
morion with a claw. “Oh, no. I’m 
afraid we can’t do that until the test- 
ing period's up, about a week from 
now.” 

“Oh, fine. That’s just grand. And 
all that time I have to go around 
with this thing clapped on my head- 
bone?” He gave a little push, weak 



and ineffectual, at the 'Jin- 
skullcap. 

Hapsburg sighed greatly. “Yes, 
sir. Oh, you won’t notice it after the 
first few hours. We kept the decora- 
tions to a minimum, and just gave it 
a plating of superiron, so it should 
be quite a bit more resistant than 
your own skull. I know its weight 
won’t bother you much longer. 
Okay?” 

“Yeah. I’ll settle for it. What 
now?” 

“Well, seeing as you understand 
the machine, nothing. I imagine you 
can loaf the rest of the trip.” 

“Okay. How far do you accom- 
pany this thing?” 

“Oh, I’ll be on Meglor’s Hunk to 
operate it.” 

“Then why didn’t you teach me to 
run it?” 

“Something might go wrong. 
You’d need help, maybe, and that’s 
where I come in. Lord knows there's 
a lot that might go wrong.” 

“Such as?” 

“The thing gets too much power 
from your head. Then it sends out a 
big blast of power to all the minds 
in the locality. Every mind has a 
protection wall to defend it from 
psychic attack, but if in this burst 
of power, the machine puts a hole 
in this wall, it needs only a little bit 
more power than normal output to 
keep your mind in an unhelmeted 
head, too. This probably won’t hap- 
pen, though. Don’t lose sleep over 
it.” 

T he Li' l Abner came in to Meg- 
lor’s Hunk on time, landing 
within an easy shot of the Bird lines.

However, none of the Birds did any- 
tiring about it, since they could easi- 
ly see the ship was untouchable, be- 
cause of its force screens. But when 
the airlock was opened, and dis- 
embarking had begun, a Bird, aided 
by luck and a pressor beam, chunk- 
ed a rock at a tank. It bounced 
harmlessly off, and would seem to 
be a rather minor incident, but it 
set the strategy experts to jabbering 
like a pack of monkeys. The Birds, 
who were utterly devoid of creative 
talent, were thought to be incapable 
of thinking up a stunt like that. 
They finally ended in agreeing that 
it had been an accident. No more 
rocks flew. 

Lagotilom sat on a heap of war- 
bird saddles, idly watching the tents 
go up and tanks and guns moving 
to their positions. A line of fifty 
warbirds, huge 25 foot tall birds like 
prehistoric Diatrymas were brought 
out to rock pens, which were painted 
red. The birds were deathly afraid 
of this color unless they had their 
saddles on, and would not leap the 
pen. This measure kept them from 
panicking and flying the coop, and 
hot-footing it over the horizon. They 
all squawked and shuffled about 
uneasily. Several soldiers, armed with 
hypodermic needles like calking guns, 
moved about through the forest of 
treelike legs injecting them with a 
tranquilizer. 

Their war harnesses, big artifacts 
of leather straps, mail, velvet cush- 
ions and fighting tools, were resting 
on the grassy turf outside of the pen, 
and Lagotilom, perched atop the pile, 
was boredly watching the passing 
show, and occasionally flung a pebble 



at the Bird lines* A few natives, in 
the meantime, had approached to 
watch the proceedings, and were al- 
lowed to stay because they avoided 
getting in the way. One stared long 
at Lagotilom, and then began a quiet 
conversation with a companion about 
some urgent subject. The crowd , of 
them pushed forward, and observed 
Lagotilom, who returned the in- 
terest half-heartedly, and a few step- 
ped forward. One began speaking in 
a tongue unknown to Lagotilom, 
but his thoughts were clear. He 
thought that Lagotilom was some 
sort of a god, and had come to 
liberate the people of Boodai from 
the yoke of the Birds. While prob- 
ably an unknown god, he showed 
little interest in mortal affairs, and 
was big enough to fit the quali- 
fications. While Lagotilom was not 
a god, he reflected that they were 
right in that he was to free them 
from the Birds. 

It was quite late before the little 
tents were set up in the camp, and 
the Li’l Abner got back into the 
orbit in which she would remain 
for the duration of the fighting. But 
the operation was quite ahead of 
schedule, owing to the native beings 
having kept Lagotilom out of the 
way. All the inhabitants of three 
towns had turned out to see him. 
The Birds, surprisingly enough, had 
done nothing about the constant line 
of natives pouring into the Terran 
camp, even though it might have 
been a dangerous situation, with Ter- 
ran and aborigine fighting Birds side 
by side. But, the Birds were totally 
uncreative, merely intelligent. All 
they had ever accomplished in the 



SIMON SAYS 



59 




past was from sheer fecundity and a 
talent for plagarism. 

Later that night, Lagotilom walked 
over to the cook tent, where several 
engineers were trading jokes under 
the hanging electric lights, glowing a 
bland yellow. 

“Oh, Mr. Nestil.” This from Haps- 
burg. “I was just considering getting 
you so we could discuss when to 
test the machine. As long as you’re 
here, we might as well start.” 

The others in the tent mumbled 
and nodded agreement. Hapsburg 
cleared his throat and began. 

“The SIMO is outside someplace, 
all set to run. It needs a watch 
engineer. We’ll draw cherries from 
my hat.” He loaded some cherries 
into his hat, one of which was red. 
“Whoever gets the red cherry gets to 
play around with the SIMO tomor- 
row.” 

Muffled agreement. A redheaded, 
blue-eyed engineer with a big nose, 
whose name was Logansport, got the 
booby prize. 

3 “Mr. Nestil, this is Pete Logans- 
port, the guy who’s gonna run the 
SIMO.” 

“Hi,” Lagotilom mumbled, his 
voice muffled by a banana he’d been 
munching. 

“What time do we start?” Haps- 
burg asked. He lit a cigarette while 
waiting for an answer. 

A balding technician who must 
have been close to ten thousand 
years old, who had been sitting near 
the refrigerator field supplied the 
answer. “0900. That way we’ll all be 
up early, and can get this damn 
job over with ail the quicker. I hate 
this planet!” 



“Any objections?” None. “Fine 
Then everybody show up at the 
SIMO tent at 0900.” 

Lagotilom left. As he walked to 
his own tent and left the warmth of 
the floodlamps, he felt a cool wind 
picking up. The Bird lines, three 
miles away, showed as a line of dim 
red lights. There were sounds in the 
Terran camp of men preparing for 
a storm. The SIMO was parked 
under a tent just visible to Lagotilom, 
and its tent’s side flaps -were as yet 
turned up, and lesser engineers were 
securing things inside. Lagotilom en- 
tered his tent, and turned on the 
heater and the fabric stiffener field 
that made the canvas invulnerable 
to attack. 

He wrapped an old hotel towel 
from Terra around his waist, after 
stripping, and sauntered over to the 
medical tent to procure a sleep 
needier and three sleep charges for it. 
He injected them into his rump and 
shoulder brains, and injected the 
third into his neck to work on his 
head-brain, which was protected by 
the helmet. 

Tre air began to smell wet, and 
they were running the side flaps 
down on the SIMO tent. 

Lagotilom caught a fleeting glance 
of the machine, yellow, red, blue 
and green lights flashing, and then 
nothing as the canvas covered it. He 
closed up his tent, hoping the medi- 
cine would allow no nightmares 
about the SIMO that night. 

The dull rumbles of thunder shook 
the night, but gingerly. The grass 
bent before the cool, wet wind, and 
the thunder muttered again, much 
closer.

T he rain had kept up all night, ac- 
companied by high winds and 
hail. Now, however, the wind was 
gone, and only a steady rain fell, 
drenching the yellowish grass. The 
two camps and the soldiers were out 
doing calisthenics. The Birds had 
their fires going, dull orange smudges 
smoldering in the distant gray, and 
were thinking the dull, dreary 
thoughts that dull, dreary races think 
on dull, dreary mornings — if such 
mornings inspire them to thinking. 

Lagotilom had awakened from an 
uneventful slumber. He had not en- 
joyed a delicious meal of fermented 
banana and pineapple mash; and had 
taken his morning jolt of brominated 
Mars Whiskey, made by the Mars 
Whisky people especially for him, 
without event. 

This morning, though, he was far 
too frightened and apprehensive to 
get drunk. He reported 15 minutes 
late to the SIMO tent, but that made 
no difference to anyone. The en- 
gineers were finishing up on the job 
that they said had been done the 
night before, and he loafed about 
inside for a full half-hour before 
anyone noticed him. It was Logans- 
port who finally did. 

“Mornin’, Mr. Nestil. Sit in this 
chair, huh?” 

“Okay.” Lagotilom sat in a puff 
of velvet with the golden neural pick- 
up strands in it, and leaned back. 
He saw an engineer across the room 
wearing the jewellike tiara of solid 
state parts that was the SIMO re- 
ceiver. A technician attached a wire 
to Lagotilom’s helmet, Hapsburg 



flipped a switch, and Lagotilom waj 
in the scientist. Then he wasn’t. 
The SIMO had passed the test. Then 
a physician Lagotilom had never 
noticed spoke up. 

“Mr. Lagotilom . .” he began, 
to be broken off by Hapsburg, who 
grumbled, “Nestil’s his surname, Cal- 
lot” 

“I’m sorry, Mr. Nestil: Um . 
Mr. Nestil, we’ve been watching you 
for the last ten minutes, and it’s 
pretty plain that you’re jerky and 
nervous. Bad for the SIMO. So I 
suggested some sort of sedative to 
Mr. Hapsburg. He agreed, seeing as 
we want top efficiency from the 
device . unlike that mental 
jammer you tested; I was there, in- 
cidentally.” He looked into a box 
he had on a table, and withdrew a 
bottle of some black liquid that 
sloshed about and stained the glass 
inside. “With this in mind, I’ve select- 
ed a sedative for you. Like the 
SIMO, it’s untested, but it has 
shown desired effects.” He sat in 
another of the puffs, and began 
fidgeting with a tiny teleportic in- 
jector. Lagotilom tensed, then relax- 
ed instantly, calmed. 

“One effect. Prothalmine, the 
drug, seems to be a mind drug. It 
first effects the body, as the mold and 
vehicle for the mind. Then, after its 
effect on the body has died down, 
it works specifically on the mind. 
No problems there.” He handled the 
bottle to Lagotilom, who looked at 
'the inklike fluid inside. 

“What’s it made from?” he asked. 

“Salivary glands of castrated 
bulls.” 

“Go on.”

61 




“Effect Two. It seems to relax the 
body for mind transfer. It’ll smother 
any surprise at your new body, and 
permits efficiency. The drug is such 
that the transferred mind will obey 
only the orders planted in the body 
before the transfer.” He waved a 
hand at the smoldering Bird fires. 
“In other words, if you were to oc- 
cupy the body of a pheasant, you 
wouldn’t be at all surprised and you 
would do what the vulture had been 
ordered, not your orders. Thank God 
that can’t happen to you.” He paused 
and looked at Lagotilom. “Get me?” 
“Sorta. Go on.” 

“Three. There can be no counter- 
manding the duplicated mind once 
the transfer is made. That means that 
there can be no interference from the 
enemy. See?” 

“Yes. How soon do we start? 
Judging from those ominous things 
you’ve been doing with that tele- 
portic there, I figure that I already 
have the bullspit in me.” 

The doctor grew slightly red. “I 
wasn't willing for this job either, so 
I want it over with too! We start as 
soon as the soldiers are in their 
positions. That’s it, isn’t it, George?” 
“Yeah. Get ready, Lagotilom. I’m 
almost done with the preliminaries.” 
“Okay. How soon?” 

“Three minutes.” 

T he rain' had abated somewhat, 
though a cold drizzle still clung 
to the air. The Birds had begun 
larger fires, and were milling about 
noticeably, as though they expected 
something big was coming off right 
under their noses and weren’t out to 
miss the game. Already some of 



their gunners were trying unsucceat- 
fully to pick their way through the 
Terran nets of defenses. Hapsburg 
sat down, and stared solemnly at 
Lagotilom, who looked back eve® 
more solemnly, using his long, this 
face to achieve a remarkably basset- 
hound effect. Hapsburg grinned. 

“Good luck, Mr. NestiL” 

“Good luck yourself. I’m not leav- 
ing ...” The switch was throw®, 
and a pulse of blue-white searing 
pain exploded in Lagofilom’s head, 
and vanished. — “the room. Dam® 
you, Hapsburg. That hurt like hell.” 

“It’s on,” replied Hapsburg, glanc- 
ing up at a wall screen upon which 
2,000 lights were arrayed in ranks. 
“Well, Mr. Nestil. All of you ac- 
counted for.” 

“Great.” Lagotilom looked at the 
screen, as the technicians left, and 
saw that the fighting had begun. 
Odd, he reflected, to know each spot 
of light on that screen is another 
you, and you’re fighting this war im 
two thousandicate, without leaving 
the tent. 

The day dragged on, and became 
oppressively hot. Numerous small 
animals were skittering through all of 
the tents, primarily the SIMO tent, 
since the mental broadcaster seemed 
to draw them. Lagotilom had to keep 
shooing them from beneath his feet, 
where they persisted in crawling, and 
from the SIMO, which had a refrig- 
erator. 

The Terrans had been making ad- 
vances all day, and had driven the 
Birds back some 2,000 yards. About 
that time, Logansport left for the 
cook shack, leaving Lagotilom and 
his animal friends alone. Minutes 



IT 




later, a small group of natives entered 
the cavernous tent, and looked awe- 
struck at the giant god with the 
crystal altar in the giant tent. A pair 
of them, pressed on by their com- 
rades, went up to Lagotilom’s feet 
and presented him with a big vat of 
some sticky stuff, colored a wicked 
yellow. Lagotilom sniffed it, and 
the poison detector sense in his nose 
told him it was safe. It didn’t really 
smell bad, either. He ate a little. 
That was a mistake. Twenty minutes 
later he had a roaring headache. 

He began blundering about the 
SIMO tent, wailing hoarsely and 
looking through red-rimmed eyes at 
the cook tent, where the technicians 
and medics and camp janitors were 
drinking freely. He watched them 
without special interest for a few 
minutes, then struck out in the direc- 
tion of the medical tent, seeking re- 
lief. After a wobbly five minutes 
afoot, he swayed into it and looked 
for the medic who wasn’t there. Dis- 
covering this, he clambered feebly 
over the counter to wander among 
rows of medicine cabinets until he 
found one full of “Emergency 
Drugs For Lieutenant Lagotilom.” 
He extracted a box of pain pills, 
and, ignoring the instructions, swal- 
lowed a handful. Seconds later, his 
head began to swim, and he felt as 
though he were expanding, becoming 
as vast as space. He blacked out. 

IV 

H is mind duplicated, as it expand- 
ed, and lodged in the brains of 
unhelmeted beings. It entered a tech- 
nician . 



The headache was suddenly gone, 
to be replaced by a feeling over his 
entire body. He felt glorious, tri- 
umphal, reckless. He felt drunk. 

He was in the cook tent. His 
vision, though blurred, could discern 
his body weaving about unsteadily 
outside, as though in the throes of 
pain. He looked about the cook tent, 
and saw other technicians sitting up 
or standing in the same strained, 
semi-alert attitude he was in. A few 
clutched crystal goblets of a pale 
green liquor, and the balding 10,000 
year elder was sitting up in a corner, 
spilling the contents of a bottle of 
brown, thousand-year-old Mars Whis- 
ky into his lap. He returned his at- 
tentions to his wavering form, now 
almost to the SIMO tent, and finally 
decided that he was in the body of 
one of the drunken technicians, or 
janitors or medics. At any rate, his 
original body needed help, and t* 
properly administer that help he had 
to be sober. To be sober, he had 
to take a few Antibooz tablets, which 
were found in the medic tent. He 
took a wobbly step in that direction. 
And one by one, the others did, too. 
But the exertion was too great, and 
they all fell flat on their faces, stone 
cold drunk. 

His expanding mind also encount- 
ered other minds like his, but these 
were lodged firmly in place. They 
could not be budged. They were the 
minds of the SIMO helmeted soldiers. 

Having been under moderate fire 
for the past half hour, Lagotilom 
could see through his peepscreen that 
the Birds had concentrated attacking 
the sham fort thrown up on the hill- 



SIMON SAYS 



S3 




side a hundred yards in back of him. 
But now, they turned their fire on 
the most likely places for soldiers to 
be entrenched, therefore the places 
that they were. He peered through 
the dust that had risen and saw that 
a small contingent of Birds had 
drawn back, and still more were 
moving forward, protected by force 
screens and hurling small bombs 
in all good hiding places. There was 
one group moving down a gully 
toward him. He withdrew an im- 
plosion grenade from his weapons 
pouch, activated it, and threw it 
at the Birds once they were near 
enough. He watched with savage 
satisfaction as it turned them in- 
to supercompressed matter, along 
with a sizeable portion of the gully 
walls. Then he cleared the entrench- 
ment lip and ran down the devastated 
gully, carefully skirting the red-hot 
area of the grenade blast. In a few 
minutes he would be in the Bird 
camp. 

T he minds that Lagotilom’s free 
minds could not enter were 
ignored, and the free minds went on, 
till they found lodging. In Birds. 
But the free minds were weak, and 
slipped out halfway. 

Lagotilom peered over the adobe 
wall surrounding his tent, and watch- 
ed the hollow between the Terran 
camp and his. It was almost impossi- 
ble to see into the depression, owing 
to the dust that had risen. But he 
could see the pale-green flashes of 
the Terran implosion grenades which 
meant that his comrades were being 
stretched across the local landscape. 
He could hear the tinkling of the 



fracturing glass nerve disruptors 
thrown by his troops. For some rea- 
son, however, the disruptors didn’t 
work; and the Terrans were fighting 
far too efficiently to make him 
happy. Lagotilom doubted that his 
troops could hold their ground much 
longer, and wished that he could 
command them more directly. He * 
felt capable of it, for his thoughts had 
suddenly cleared from murky gloom 
to crystal clarity. He went back to 
his fur hammock and lay in it. 

Toying idly with the black feath- 
ers on his left wing, he pulled out 
some red ones that were to him as a 
gray hair was to a Terran. He look- 
ed out the door again, and standing 
up, told himself that he was doing 
absolutely nothing by staying in the 
tent. He removed some small atomic 
grenades from a wooden crate, select- 
ed a few candies from a bowl rest- 
ing on a table, and walked out to his 
pedacycle. Before entering it, he took 
a final look at the battlefield. The 
Terrans, advertising their sentiments 
concerning war, had put up a sign 
on their sham fort which said, 
“Birds, go to hell!” 

Lagotilom gunned the motor on 
his pedacycle, and progressed at a 
leisurely pace. By the time he reach- 
ed the battlefield, he had noticed 
that his soldiers were all fighting in 
a new and very nasty manner. 

As he turned his pedacycle down a 
gully he reflected that it was as 
though he was doing all of the fight- 
ing himself. 

One mind, remained with his 
original body, pain wracked, at the 
Terran camp.

His headache having abated some- 
what, Lagotilom inspected the camp 
with a clearer head. He shooed a 
few small animals from the tent, 
looked about for his technicians and 
the camp personal, and saw them on 
the cook tent floor, dead drunk. 

Damn fools, he thought, with a 
war going on they think their new 
toy is so goddam good they could 
get drunk. He glanced at the wall 
progress map, then, and saw some- 
thing uncanny was going on. Only 
half of the Birds were at the fight- 
ing front, with the rest back of the 
line, doing something that seemed to 
be mechanical in nature. A few min- 
utes later, Lagotilom saw that they 
were assembling the huge spring 
catapults that they always carried 
about with them but never used. 
When they were finished, they used 
them to lob concussion bombs over 
the lines, and in the terranean tsuna- 
mi that followed, they advanced 100 
yards. This strange, original tactic 
unnerved Lagotilom. He sat closer 
to the screen for the next few hours, 
watching maneuver after brilliant 
maneuver on each side. He wonder- 
ed. 

The Terran maneuvers he could 
account for, but the Birds, no. It was 
almost as though he were doing all 
their fight-controlling himself. 

A board the Li’ l Abner , General 
Pruneface Duffey was fasci- 
nated. He felt anxiety such as 90 
prior years of Bird fighting had 
never before given him. Never before 
had he heard of the stinking phea- 
sants fighting like this; and that 
Lagotilom lizard was doing a beauti- 



ful job of controlling the Terraa 
troops. But being realistic, Duffey 
could see that the situation was get- 
ting serious. He waved his hand over 
a red globe, and his aide, Ensign Piet 
van Mieris, a smallish man with thin- 
ning blond hair and a nervous tic in 
either cheek, entered the room, to 
be waved to a settee. 

Duffey looked at him and spoke. 
“Watch that screen for a few min- 
utes.” 

“Um. Sir, I have been watching 
it in the other room. The Birds are 
doing pretty good.” 

“Too damn good. Far too damn 
good.” Duffey stood up, walked 
across his room, and aimed a vicious 
kick at a stuffed Bird propped up in 
a corner holding a handful of cigars 
and a tomahawk. He missed, took 
one of the cigars, lit it, and contin- 
ued. “The Birds never fought this 
way before. I don’t see why they 
should start now.” 

Van Mieris looked gloomily at 
Duffey. “Well, they have to start 
someplace.” 

“If I want philosophy, I’ll ask for 
it,” Duffey snarled. 

“Well, General Duffey, I don’t 
see why they shouldn’t fight well, 
now. What I’m about to tell you 
I have no substantial proof for, but 
it’s what I heard, and it seems to 
fit in. Before I signed up as your 
aide, I was on the report staff of 
General Copeland in the Crotch, 
and I heard something about the 
Birds having captured a military 
computer on Tarrarree, when they 
were holding that world. Its parts are 
subspacial, and it operates on the 
same force that keeps time moving. 



66 



IF 




It would occupy almost no space at 
all, so it could be lodged in each 
soldier’s head, or, if it is as hard 
for the Birds to make as I suspect, 
it could be hidden anyplace on their 
base. Mind you, sir, I’ve no proof 
for this. Don’t regard it as gospel 
truth.” He sighed greatly and started 
to leave. Duffey stopped him. 
“Dutch, how long ago was this?” 
“About three months.” 

“Then that must be what’s going 
on down there. The Birds must have 
one of those military computers com- 
manding them. Get the Whiz Kids 
up here. I want to build an anti- 
computer for that sort of thing.” 
“But, sir . .” 

Duffey waved the complaining van 
Miens on impatiently. “Hop to it, 
man. I want those crazy bastards 
here at once.” 

Van Mieris sighed again, and 
groaned, “Yes, sir.” 

Twenty minutes later, the Whiz 
Kids, or Starship Computorial Team 
and Emergency Weapons Modifiers 
shuffled in. They were six tall, bleak- 
looking men with a funeral air hover- 
ing about them. 

Duffey surveyed them with dis- 
taste, and said, “Did Dutch tell you 
what the Birds are using down be- 
low?” Nods and dull uh-huhs. 

“Fine. I want a machine built to 
knock out that kind of ... of ma- 
chine. How soon can you have it 
done?” 

A gaunt-faced man with short- 
cropped gray hair, dressed in an oil- 
paint-smeared smock, spoke up. “By 
morning, if we work all night.” 
“Great! Get it done. And make 
sure it’s readily portable.” 



“Yes, sir.” The cordon of en- 
gineers dragged out again, and Duf- 
fey almost made a sarcastic remark 
about rousing them from their cof- 
fins. 

E vidently they didn’t work all 
night, for it was 1300 before 
they brought their machine up to 
show Duffey. As they plodded in, 
Duffey saw, sitting on a stretcher, a 
blue-metal generator that fairly 
bristled with glass tubes. The oil- 
painted engineer, who in all prob- 
ability was the one who was to test 
the machine, was a bit perkier. He 
struck the hull of the machine, which 
responded with a hollow clang. 

“This is our baby. Weighs three 
tons. On such short notice, it was 
as portable as we could get it. It’ll 
have to do,” he said. 

Pruneface asked. “Anything you 
need?” 

“There is. Yeah. An armored car. 
I want one of the larger ones with 
the star-drive in them. The little ones 
don’t have enough of a power supply 
in them to run this thing. I want it 
to have an efficient force-field, too. 
I don’t want the Birds shooting us 
down once they realize what it is 
we’re up to.” 

“You mean you gotta fly this thing 
all over hell’s half acre to make it 
work?” Pruneface asked with angry 
insinuation in his voice. 

“Just to plant our seeds. We gotta 
know whether it’ll work at all, first. 
That’s the way we’ll find out quick. 
Then we can land in the camp and 
run it from there? Say! Have you 
gotten any hints from camp as to 
where this thing may be hidden?” 



SIMON SAYS 



57 




‘Not a one. In fact, we haven’t 
heard from camp since early last 
night. Seems their radio went on 
the fritz.” 

Well, it won’t make much differ- 
ence Call the carport. Tell ’em to 
get one ready. Okay, sir?” 

“Yeah.” Duffey picked up his 
desk phone’s receiver and listened to 
it click throatily before a nasal voice 
founded in his ear. 

“Yes?” it said. 

“Get me the armored car division.” 
It clicked again. Duffey then said “1 
want car number ten for the Whiz 
Kids. I want a pilot and a copilot in 
it, too. Get it to port seven.” 

The porcupine generator was load- 
ed into the weapons hold, and the 
occupants of the little bottle-shaped 
spaceship entered it. Humming 
slightly, the armored car dropped 
away from the Li’l Abner , and plum- 
meted to the yellow and purple 
planet below. Inside, the Whiz Kid 
thought about his machine. Then he 
thought about the SIMO. He put 
two and two together, then, and 
hoped that his machine would not 
foul the SIMO’s works. He feared 
greatly it would. Then he took a 
•wig of whisky. 

V 

O ne of the soldier Lagotiloms of 
Terra crept rapidly up a gully. 
Lagotilom found the gully quite 
a bit longer than he had first thought, 
and was considering jumping its 
sides and running across the sur- 
rounding land, when another wave 
from a concussion bomb surged in 
back of him, and an excited chatter 



began very close. Bird talk. Ah ^ 
this there was the soft hum ot a 
Bird staff car, progressing slowly 
down the gully. It was a flat disk 
mounted on two soda-straw legs, with 
a primitive gasoline motor in the 
back, a scrap of armor in the front, 
a gun, and a piece of black-feathered 
brass. Only the Sexed ones, the rich 
aristocracy of the Birds, had black 
feathers, and these were only found 
at established Bird bases. But one was 
riding a staff car down the gully. 
Lagotilom figured that it would be 
quite a feather in his cap if he were 
to capture this one. He hid in a 
wide crack in the gully floor, and 
threw a rope noose out to trap the 
leg of the staff car as it went by. As 
its hum grew louder, he wondered 
what the Bird inside was thinking, 
doing, observing. 

Lagotilom could see that the gully 
he was in led past the Terran lines, 
right to under the bluff that the 
Terran encampment rested upon. He 
increased the pedacycle’s speed, and 
saw that the gully was longer than 
he had expected, probably due to 
both the dust and the concussion 
bombs, which made mirages that 
fooled one’s distance-sense. The cycle 
ran over an area of arroyo floor that 
was a bit cracked, so Lagotilom 
slowed his pedacycle again, and saw 
the noose in front of a crevice, 
waiting. He gunned the motor, and 
turned the speed down to slow, re- 
sulting in steps of rather bone-crush- 
ing violence. A foot stepped into 
the crevice, a choked scream came 
from within, and Lagotilom felt 
proud of himself. His first Terran. 



68 



IF 




Then he turned his attention to the 
Terran camp, and saw a reptilian 
figure peer from a tent, far off. He 
wondered what this figure was. 

The day had been hot and sunny. 
So hot, in fact, that Lagotilom had 
thought the very air to be turning 
yellow. Now, though, it was cooling 
off again, and through the veillike 
clouds that had formed, the wester- 
ing sun presented a dull, smudgy ap- 
pearance. Occasionally, Lagotilom 
could hear rumbles of very distant 
thunder. A cool wind was blowing 
from the west, carrying cool air down 
from the distant blue-gray moun- 
tains. 

Lagotilom watched the dozing 
technicians, the battle chart, the sky 
and the SIMO. It was having one of 
its restless periods, and it hummed 
louder, its spark-gaps flashing with 
considerably more power. Another 
sound, coming from the sky, could be 
heard above the SIMO’s droning. 
Lagotilom cast his eyes that way 
and saw a glint that he recognized 
as a Terran armored car encom- 
passed by a force-field. 

It leveled off, and made a few 
passes above the battlefield, as if ex- 
pectant of something that didn’t 
seem to be happening. It dropped 
to a mile, and made a few more 
passes, swishing about as though a 
bit frustrated. Finally, it circled the 
camp, and landed a few hundred 
yards from the tents. A jeep with 
three people and a metal and glass 
porcupine slid from the transporta- 
tion hold, and drew to a halt out- 
side of Lagotilom’s tent. 

A tall, cadaverous man jumped 



out, took a swig from a liquor 
bottle, and began moving dials and 
twisting knobs and punching studs 
on the machine in back. It glowed 
fitfully, sounded off like a flushing 
toilet, and did nothing else. One of 
the two men in the front seat, after 
watching a few seconds, said some- 
thing softly. The tall man snorted, 
and, turning his attention to a 
small viewscreen clamped in the 
front seat, made modifications on 
the porcupine. It sputtered and 
quit. He raised a huge fist and hit 
it hard on its side, then, after calm- 
ing down, walked over to the SIMO 
tent, watching Lagotilom. 

“Lieutenant Lagotilom.” He 
stated it, not asked it. 

“Yeah. I’m me. What?” 

“You been watching that car- 
toon up there?” He jerked a thumb 
at the wall battle screen. 

“Yeah. Lousy show. Whatever’s 
got into those lousy bastards, any- 
way? Why are they fighting so 
good?” 

“Ah, we think it’s some sorta 
time-spacial computer they cap- 
tured at the Crotch on Tarrarree. 
The Pruneface told us it’s doin’ all 
their thinkin’ for ’em, so we built 
that thing and hauled it down here 
and it went and broke down. You 
saw it do that . hey. What’s 
wrong with that thing?” For the 
first time, he seemed to notice the 
SIMO, which, upon arrival of the 
computorial disruptin', had been 
composing an electronic symphony. 

“I dunno. I been wired to it all 
day, and all it gave me was a head- 
ache.” 

“Oh. Where are its technicians 



SIMON SAYS 



69 




• . where is everybody , for that 
matter?” 

“Drunk. In the cook tent.” 
“Drunk?” 

“Yeah, drunk. Dead drunk. They 
got so confident about their toy 
they thought that it didn’t need 
them any longer. So they went and 
fOt drunk. They flopped on the 
floor about noon, and they’ve been 
that way ever since.” 

“I oughta leave them there.” 
“You might as well. I doubt if 
you could rouse ’em, anyway.” 
Later, after the machine had been 
repaired and taken to the front 
fines, Lagotilom saw the rolling 
gray clouds turn a sinister blackish- 
green, lightning flashing out of 
them. Rain began plikking at the 
taut fabric of the tents, and with 
every lightning flash, the SIMO 
crackled loudly, and an unhealthy 
yellow glow pervaded the tent. As 
Lagotilom let the side flaps down, 
he saw the bullet-shaped jeep run 
up the ramp of the armored car, 
which extruded its psionic radio 
staff the next minute. It was im- 
mediately struck by lightning, and 
Lagotilom’s head exploded. The 
SIMO broke into a frenzied tocsin. 

L agotilom’s mind grew larger 
' than ' it had the first time 
creeping across the planet’s surface 
to ten miles from the SIMO. It 
struck many minds, including those 
of natives. Again, it slipped, leav- 
ing enough of the native’s mind in 
the body to taint Lagotilom’s mind. 

Lagotilom dropped his feathery 
aluminum pitchfork, and threw 

70 



open the door to his small, hideskin 
barn. A cold wind blew the dried 
snakeweed hay about the barn. 
Leaving the barn, he shut the door 
with his lower tentacles, ruffled his 
plumage with bis feathered muscles, 
and shut out the cold rain that fell. 
In the direction of the town fields, 
he saw flashes of imploding imploder 
grenades in unison with concussion 
bombs. Beyond that was another 
glow, but red. It was the town burn- 
ing. Lagotilom grimly damning both 
the Terrans and the Birds entered his 
stave and hide house. He took a 
drill-lance from the wall, put on a 
suit of bronze chain mail, and load- 
ed his hand-pistol with drillheads. 
He was going to stop both the Ter- 
rans and the Birds. On the road, he 
met others who were going to the 
town for the same reason, and he 
joined them without a word. He 
thought about the Terrans, and won- 
dered what they were doing. 

After the pedacyle had narrowly 
missed stepping on him, Lagotilom 
had crawled from the crevice, and 
saw that the staff car was going to 
be hard to catch. So, deciding against 
chasing it, he turned his attentions to 
the burning town, whose medieval 
walls stood black beneath leaping 
flames. He saw tiny figures moving 
along the top of the wall, and de- 
cided to join the fun. But he still 
wondered what the Bird in the staff 
car was doing. 

Lagotilom, only a mile distant 
from the Terran camp, knew he 
stuck out like a fishwife in a Pari- 
sian fashion show, but he hadn’t 



IF 




drawn a single shot. In fact, with 
the exception of a single tent that 
seemed to be having a miniature 
storm of its own going on inside, 
there was no visible action anywhere 
in the camp. He muted his cycle’s 
motor, and brought it to a slow 
sneak, and drove up the incline to 
the Terran base. He watched the 
instruments on his dashboard to 
warn of monkey-business detectors, 
but there were no such detectors. 
He moved cautiously up the slip- 
pery hill. He wondered what was 
going on inside that tent. 

Lagotilom watched the armored 
car a few minutes, but it showed no 
signs of life. Well, he thought, it 
would take care of itself. He left 
the SIMO tent for the medical pa- 
vilion, and saw a large thing ap- 
proaching the camp from the hill’s 
bottom. He was alarmed for an in- 
stant, then grinned as it slipped 
and went crashing down the hill, 
amid squawks of consternation. 
When were those Birds ever going 
to learn that pedacycles can’t climb 
hills? He went on his way, but be- 
fore he entered the medical tent, he 
looked at the dark hulk of the ar- 
mored car, and wondered what had 
happened to the men within. 

Lagotilom's mind, in expanding, 
had caught the three men from the 
ship and lodged in them immediate- 
ly. But they were unconscious. Then 
one stirred . 

Lagotilom regained consciousness 
with a spinning vision of a ship’s 
control room. He looked at the 
ruined psiooic projector, with its 



now-dead horse brain lying on the 
floor amid shards of glass that was 
its former casing globe. He looked 
around the control room of the ar- 
mored car and saw his pilot and 
copilot on the floor, woozily trying 
to regain their feet. He searched fev- 
erishly about for the first aid kit. 

Lagotilom’s mind, in expanding, 
had caught the three men in the 
armored car, and it had also struck 
the psionic radio, which was trained 
upon the ship. In the instant before 
it burst and died, it cast his mind 
up . .. up ... up to the LVl Abner 
where it found another place to 
lodge. 

There was no other personality 
in this brain ... he took over com- 
pletely . 

The phone on Norge Gearling’s 
desk rang, and he brushed aside 
piles of colored papers, lifted the re- 
ceiver and asked, “Yeah. Whoozis? 
Whatcha want?” 

An excited voice sounded in his 
ear, constantly dimming because its 
owner kept turning his head to look 
at something. 

“Mr. Gearling! That big psionic 
radio down in the communications 
room. It thinks it’s Lagotilom! You 
better get down here, fast!” Gear- 
ling stared at the receiver as if it 
were a disease carrier. 

“You wanna repeat that, please?” 
he asked. 

“I said that big psionic radio in 
the communications room thinks 
it’s Lagotilom! It’s been sending 
complaints all over its screens for 
the last few minutes, but we just 
figured out what’s wrong now. It

keeps changing from red to gray 
and back again. 1 don’t see why it 
should think it’s Lagotilom. Lagotil- 
om’s down on the Hunk. Come on 
down and see for yourself!” 

Gearling could see that something 
had very definitely gone wrong, for 
the huge horse brain suspended in 
the giant glob of waxy, oily gum 
was changing colors very fast, and 
it did indeed hold to the opinion 
that ii was Lagotilom. In a very 
slow, plodding voice it inquired what 
in hell was going on. Then a few 
sensor units went into action, the 
voice cleared and became that of 
Lagotilom. “Gearling. I can see you 
in here. I’m supposed to be in sol- 
dier-type brains. I’m in a horse-type 
brain. What the hell went wrong?” 

“Lagotilom. Is that you?” Gear- 
ling shouted. 

“No It’s not me. I’m the Centaur 
and I’m out to conquer the universe. 
Dammit! Of course I’m Lagotilom. 
What in hell am I doing here?” The 
voice held anger and fear, and had 
an urgency to it. 

Gearling was gesticulating to the 
communications engineers, who were 
scuttling about trying to keep the 
giant brain cool. He looked at the 
gleaming waxy chunk, suspended in 
a nest of wires and supported by a 
metal box and shouted. “Don’t 
worry, Lagotilom. We’ll get you out 
of there.” As he shouted these 
words, he immediately realized how 
inadequate and ridiculous they 
sounded. Then he turned on his heel 
and ran up the ramp to the Whiz 
Kids’ office, three levels up. At the 
peeling veneer counter he rang the 
little silver pushbell until one of the 



cadaverous men stirred from the 
perpetual backroom craps game. 
“What the hell do you want, Gear- 
ling?” he snarled. 

“What do you know about psionit 
radios? Especially the big one?” 
“Nothing. You’re the chief com- 
municator. You oughta be able to 
fix it.” 

“Well, I can’t. They never taught 
me one thing about anything but 
temporospacial radio.” Gearling 
grabbed a wall phone, got the radio 
room, and asked for a straight con- 
nection to Lagotilom and the psionic 
radio. “Lagotilom. What’s going on 
down there, on the Hunk?” 

“What do you want me to tel 
you?” 

“You got any idea what got you 
up here?” 

“Unless it’s the SIMO, no. I’ve no 
idea what it may be doing now, 
but when I saw it last, it was buzz- 
ing and sparking to beat the devil.** 
“Why don’t its technicians fix it?" 
“Cause they’ve been dead drunk 
since noon. Nobody down here but 
me and those three guys you sent 
down in the armored car. They 
haven’t shown their faces since the 
storm started and their car got hit 
by lightning. At least, I don’t think 
they’ve shown their faces.” 

Gearling put his hand over the 
mouthpiece of the phone, and spoke 
to the Whiz Kid. “What do you 
know about fixing SIMOs?” 

“Precious little. Last night you 
told me all its technicians were down 
on the Hunk. What are they do- 
ing?” 

“Dead drunk, according to Lag- 
otilom.”

IF 




“Dammit, GearHng. Can*t you get 
something done? I have a feeling 
something bad is gonna happen 
down there and ...” A sudden 
•cream burst from the phone. Sec- 
onds later, it drifted up from the 
communications room. Then after 
a pause, the phone began babbling 
thoughts so disjointed as to be ab- 
solutely senseless. Gearling put the 
phone down. 

“Did you hear him?” he said. 

“Yes. But what happened?” the 
Whiz Kid asked. 

“I’d bank he nearly got struck by 
lightning, and that SIMO did some- 
thing with all the excess energy that 
I don’t like to think about. We have 
to go down.” 

“In this storm? God, no. And we 
have to find out what happened 
first, too.” 

The verdict came, minutes later, 
when the phone jangled coarsely. 

“Yes?” asked Gearling. 

“We’ve deciphered that babble. 
Get down here at once.” The voice 
was tense. 

And Gearling wondered what was 
happening to Lagotilom. 

VI 

L agotilom’s head was bursting. 

New starbursts of pain explod- 
ed inside his skull each time some 
lightning flashed. Besides, he was in 
the middle of what he had been as- 
sured would not happen. His mind 
was lost among hundreds of other 
minds, all pressing down on him, all 
babbling, all confused. He wished 
for unconsciousness, but it would 
not come — all of those minds . • • 



Gearling looked at the papers and 
grimaced. So that was it. The infal- 
lible SIMO had been broadcasting 
Lagotilom’s mind to everything that 
could accommodate it To top it off, 
it had obtained a jump from a 
psionic projector to fling his mind up 
to the ship’s psionic radio. The 
booster brain was very dead, but it 
had only given the SIMO what it 
needed, the power to push a Lag- 
otilom-mind to the ship. No more 
power than the SIMO normally pro- 
vided would keep it up there once 
contact had been made. Now it had 
been deciphered that Gearling had 
been right about the lightning. Some 
had struck the SIMO tent, and this 
had jolted the machine so severely 
that Lagotilom and the ship’s psionic 
radio had been confused with all the 
soldier brains’ activities. And Birds 
and natives. Now one thing re- 
mained to be done. Deactivate the 
SIMO. And he wondered about the 
Terran soldier Lagotiloms . 

Lagotilom crouched in a square- 
mouthed culvert high on the city’s 
wall shooting Birds as they passed 
by. The town was burning, and the 
horrible stench from burning leather 
was wafted his way. And he was 
weary, too. A few minutes before, 
a sudden wave of confusion had 
hit him, and while it wasn’t as bad 
as before, he still couldn’t keep his 
mind on urgent subjects. He thought 
about his friends, the Li’ l Abner , 
and the Bird that he had left walking 
to the Terran camp . 

After his pedacycle had broken 
a leg in the slide down the muddy 



SIMON SAYS 



fS 




hill, Lagotilom had crept back up 
the side and had tried to enter the 
camp, but was nearly struck uncon- 
scious by a blast of sheer confus- 
ion. He backed away hastily, but it 
still lingered, and, combining with 
the cold and the wet, made him very 
miserable indeed. He sat in the rain, 
shivered, and cast longing glances 
at the warmth of the burning town, 
five miles away. Then he wondered 
how the natives were taking all of 
this; what they were doing . 

Lagotilom was in tow. He had 
killed two Terrans and ten Birds. 
The little rune-painted stave and 
hide houses of the people of Boodai, 
his people, were almost all in 
flames, despite the rain. Lit by the 
orange fires of the conflagration, 
Birds could be seen fighting Boodai 
and Terrans on the thick city walls. 
The fallen and dead of all three 
races fell on the sharpened wooden 
spikes that thrust up inside the walls, 
and spattered tri-colored blood into 
the gutters and streets, where it 
mixed in veils with water and was 
swept down drains or collected in 
puddles. He tripped over a loose 
barrelhoop, and at the same time, 
felt the hot kiss of a knife sever a 
tentacle. He twisted and sent a 
spiral drill-charge through the neck 
of the gray Bird that stood over him 
with a huge butcher cleaver. He 
scuttled to his feet, and ran across 
the bloody town square to the shel- 
ter in the sub-city passages. If he 
stayed out here missing an arm, he 
might lose his life. Best to run to 
live another day. As he ran into 
the passages, he felt the confusion 



that had struck him five minutes 
earlier pass. He wondered what 
could have caused it, and why it 
seemed so sinister, despite its weak- 
ness . 

Lagotilom had screamed himself 
hoarse from the pain in his head, 
from the minds, from the deafen- 
ing pounding sounds from the 
SIMO. He now blundered about the 
tent aimlessly, pounding on what- 
ever he ran into, hoping it to be the 
SIMO. Finally he collapsed, and the 
tiny air tubes that permeated his 
brain to provide air-cooled thoughts 
were spouting hot blood. He as- 
sumed the foetal position on the 
floor which ran with mud, and fell 
backward in his thoughts . until 
he did not even notice Gearling 
come up to the SIMO, unlock its 
control box, and shut it off. But he 
was aware of the effect, for he col- 
lapsed happily, feeling, just before 
the deathlike plunge, that it was 
good to be alone again. 

CCOo, Commandant Henly, sir, 

O that is my report. No more 
Birds on Meglor’s Hunk, and no 
more Terrans. The natives just want 
to be left to their own devices, with- 
out meddling from space. And that 
machine . .” Lagotilom let the 
sentence trail into meaningful ob- 
livion. 

“Well, Nestil, at least you did test 
it. I’ll give you (JMit for that. And 
you got your promotion.” 

Lagotilom looked at his colonel’s 
Comet on his sweater’s collar, and 
said, “Yes, I did. I’m damn happy 
the New Inventions Bureau knows 



74 



IP 




it’s just a pipe dream at present.” 
Suddenly Lagotilom sat erect, as if 
he had just struck an elementary 
truth. “Sir, there’s been something 
buzzing around the back of my 
mind the last few days. I know what 
it is, now. This SIMO machine. 
Subelectronic Integrator for the 
Manipulation of Objects, by Nestil. 
SIMON. Ever heard of Simon 
Says?” 

“Beg pardon?” 

“Simon Says. It’s a game. When 
I was on Terra my first week the 
Education Administration put me 
into a first grade class with 50 other 
first graders of as many different 
races. They thought I was of nor- 
mal IQ. There was this game called 



Simon Says. The kid’d mimic the 
teacher as long as she said Simon 
Says Do This or That. But if she 
said do this or that without the 
Simon Says, and the kid mimicked 
her anyways, he was out of the 
game. I always thought this was 
pretty damn unfair, so I rigged the 
game. This was just like one of 
those rigged games. You couldn’t 
lose; ergo, the machine did work; 
but you couldn’t win. And everyone 
did what they were supposed to do.* 
Lagotilom chuckled immoderately. 
“This whole damn demonstration, 
all of it, was just another game of 
Simon Says.” And he left the of- 
fice, chuckling thoroughly .

J ames M. Hey den, head of the 
Advanced Research Projects Di- 
vision of the Continental Multitech- 
nikon Corporation, blew his breath 
out exasperatedly, sat back in the 
expensive aggregation of pads and 
springs that served as his desk chair, 
and read the handwritten note 
again: 



Jim — 

Pat tells me we are now so far 
ahead of the international com- 
petition, defensewise, that no large 
new government orders can be 
expected. Introduction of any new 
and revolutionary gimcrack at 
this time would, therefore, be 
most unwelcome and inexpedient. 
So put the new gimmicks on the 
back burner, and get going full

Hast on that Kiddie Kit Science 
Series. We’ll expect rapid prog- 
ress, as we want the first three 
Kits on the market at least ninety 
days before Christmas. Naturally 
the Moon Krawler should be one 
of these first Kits. 

Any suggestions you may have 
for utilizing our now top heavy 
staff of technicians and engineers 
would be appreciated. We assume 
you will cull the deadwood. Re- 
member that in pruning, you want 
to cut pretty close into sound 
wood, as this actually promotes 
rapid healing and leaves no dead 
stump to fester. 

Also, you will of course bear in 
mind that we have a little dif- 
ferent approach, expensewise, on 
items for the general public, as 
opposed to rush government or- 
ders. The Krawler should retail 
at not over $13.95, according to 
market simulation on our big new 
MIMIC computor. The Krawler, 
remember, does not have to fit 
into a cramped space, or endure 
high acceleration, vacuum, or a 
lunar landing. It won’t break our 
heart if the thing fails to last long 
enough for our great-grandchild- 
ren to play with It on Mars; of 
course, it shouldn’t fall apart be- 
fore the holidays are over, either. 

I know I don’t have to spell 
this out for you, Jim. Ed and I 
are going to be out on the coast 
for a couple of weeks, enjoying 
the California smog, and trying 
out those twelve-lane, six-deck 
highways they brag about. If the 
merger goes through, we’ll be gone 
another week, anyway, but that 



won’t matter. We’ll be so diversi- 
fied then that nothing but an- 
other 1929 could really put us 
under. 

So, bear down hard on the re- 
conversion, streamlining, and ra- 
tionalization of your operation. 
Incidentally, the MIMIC simula- 
tion indicates that the other two 
kits should sell, respectively, at 
$8.95 and $29.95. Obviously, you 
can shoot the works on the latter 
model, though we’ll expect a more 
generous profit, too. 

Just what these other two kits 
should be, we don’t know, as our 
programmer was evidently unable 
to figure out just how to put the 
question to the computor. The 
computor gave out nothing but 
gibberish on the subject. So we’ll 
leave that up to you. 

This is, of course, all your re- 
sponsibility, Jim, but I hope you’ll 
be generally guided by the spirit 
of these few suggestions. 

We’ll look forward to seeing 
things well along when we get 
back from Cal. 

Stu 

H eyden sat up straight, and 
swore. He hit the intercom 
button. 

“Nell!” 

There was a startled feminine 
squeak, “Sir?” 

“Dig up that note from Stu Gross- 
rad — the one he sent about eighteen 
months ago — the one that said ‘full 
speed ahead, damn the torpedoes,' 
and so on.” 

“That was longer ago than eigh- 
teen months. I think — ”

“Never mind that. Dig it up. And 
the one before that — that one about 
blasting out a foxhole and hiding 
m it. And the one before that, too 
— I think there was one before 
that.” 

Heyden sat back and looked over 
the note. A fresh burst of profanity 
escaped him just as his secretary 
came in with several sheets of paper, 
and then, blushing bright pink, 
turned to leave. 

“Hold on,” said Heyden. He 
looked over the previous notes, and 
glanced up at her. “Listen to this: 
\ . the sky's no limit, boy. With 
this monster government program 
shaping up, we can carve off any 
size chunk we can eat. So beef up 
your technical staff, get that wild 
blue yonder stuff out of the deep 
freeze, shove this low-key junk we’re 
working on onto a back burner, and 
set your sights on Arcturus . .’ ” 

Heyden looked up in angry indig- 
nation. “There’re three pages like 
that.” 

“Yes, sir.” His secretary looked 
baffled for a moment, then strug- 
gled to match his look of indigna- 
tion. 

“And,” said Heyden, reaching for 
an earlier note, “before that, we had 
this business: 

“ \ . too bad, but the bottom has 
gone out the way it can only go out 
when Uncle pulls the plug, and now 
instead of cruising along in ten 
fathoms of deep green sea, all of a 
sudden we’re grinding on the rocks. 
We’re going to have to shorten sail 
and throw the ballast overboard, or 
we’re ended right here. We’re top 
heavy with hypertechnical stuff that 



nobody wants but Uncle — when ha 
wants it. And now he doesn’t want 
it. So get rid of it. Junk the fancy 
projects. What we need is a money- 
maker, fast. .’ ” 

Heyden shoved that aside, glared 
up at his secretary, who swallowed 
nervously, and then he reached for 
the earliest sheet of paper, settled 
back, and read aloud: 

“ ‘. the opportunity of the 
century, boy. We can get in there 
on the ground floor. Jhe public is 
screaming for action. Congress is 
boiling over with urgency. It’s, “Get 
results! Damn the expense!” I don’t 
need to tell you that in an atmos- 
phere like this, the streets are paved 
with golden opportunity. Now’s the 
time to beef up your technical staff, 
build for the future, get in on the 
ground floor, r*v! . .’ ” 

Heyden slapped the papers down. 
“And so on, for pages. Well, there 
we are. Just what do you think of 
that?” 

His secretary scanned his face 
quickly and looked indignant again. 

GCXTou see,” said Heyden angrily, 
I “just what happens here. 
We’re like a damn-fool rocket that 
wastes half its thrust decelerating. 
Now we’re supposed to unload peo- 
ple we pirated away from other out- 
fits six months ago. Twelve to eigh- 
teen months from now, we’ll be 
scrambling to get these very same 
people back again. We set up a 
winning team, then when we get a 
few points ahead in the internation- 
al game, we have to disband it. The 
other team, over across the ocean, 
keeps on playing, and all of a sud- 



78 



i r 




den there comes a howl from the 
fans. The opposition is wiping us 
all over the field. Then, quick , we’ve 
got to put together a winning team 
again. And then, again, when we 
get a few points ahead — ” His face 
changed expression, and for a mo- 
ment he looked boiling mad. Then 
he blew out his breath, and shrug- 
ged, “It’s like a manic-depressive 
psychosis. The wasted energy is 
terrific. And when we’re on the 
‘down’ half of the cycle, if the 
other side should just get far 
enough ahead — ” 

“Yes, sir,” said his secretary 
agreeably. “That’s just what you 
said the last time, sir. Did you want 
to see Mr. Benning, or should I — ” 

Heyden scowled. “What does 
Benning want?” 

“He says it’s about that advanced 
‘High-G’ project. I knew you’d be 
busy reading Mr. Grossrad’s letter, 
so I had Mr. Benning wait.” 

Heyden shrugged. “It’s all aca- 
demic now. But send him in.” 

“Yes, sir.” She went out. A mo- 
ment later, a tall intense man with 
blue eyes that seemed to be lit from 
within walked through the doorway, 
carrying under one arm a bundle 
wrapped in dark green paper. He 
shut the door, walked directly to 
Heyden’s desk, and set the bundle 
down. There was a faint light 
crackle of paper, and then the 
bundle tipped lightly back and 
forth, resting on the desk with all 
the solidity of a piece of hollow bal- 
sa wood. 

Having set the bundle down, Ben- 
ning now glanced all around fur- 
tively, then nodded to Heyden. 



“Well,” he said, In a low secretive 
voice, “we got it.” 

Heyden was glancing from the 
bundle to Benning. He’d never seen 
Benning like this before. 

Benning, blue eyes glowing, re- 
peated, “We got it.” He turned, 
glanced around the room, put his 
finger to his lips, and reached 
across the stupefied Heyden’s desk 
to pick up a scratch pad. He scrib- 
bled rapidly as Heyden, with fast- 
growing uneasiness, moved his chair 
back so he’d have freedom of action 
if it suddenly developed that Ben- 
ning had gone off the deep end. 

Benning sat down across the desk, 
and slid the pad to Heyden. Hey- 
den read: 

High-G total success. Working 
model right there across the desk 
from you. Don't talk about it out 
loud. Have reason to think your of- 
fice here is bugged . 

n 

H eyden glanced rapidly from the 
pad to Benning to the green- 
wrapped package. For a moment he 
considered what it would mean if 
Benning was telling the truth. The 
package immediately looked like a 
huge bundle of big green banknotes. 
He came back to earth and remind- 
ed himself that Benning might be 
out of his head. He wrote rapidly 
on the pad: Bugged by who, the 
Russians? and said aloud, “When 
you come in here with that porten- 
tious look, Ben, you better have 
something to back it up. You say 
you ‘got it.’ Don’t just sit there 
looking happy. You got what?" 



80 



IF 




Benning could now do any of a 
number of things, and Heyden sat 
on the edge of his chair, watching 
intently to see what came next. 

Benning looked at the pad, glanc- 
ed at places where a “bug” might 
be hidden, and crossed his fingers 
to show he spoke for the benefit of 
uninvited listeners. “What we’ve got 
is a damn good gimmick to get us 
a government contract on this, boy. 
We’ve run into a little glimmer of 
pay dirt on this one. I can see just 
how to start the golden flood pour- 
ing in, and keep it flowing for 
years.” 

He wrote rapidly on the pad, and 
shoved it across the desk. Heyden 
read. 

Not the Russians. /. /. 

Heyden winced and glanced 
around. “M’m,” he said aloud. 
“Well, I don’t know. I got quite a 
note from Stu Grossrad.” 

Benning sat up. “No kidding?” 
“No kidding.” 

“What did Stu say?” 

“What does he ever say? It’s 
either ‘Full speed ahead!’ or ‘Emer- 
gency reverse!’ The last time, we 
were supposed to go all out, shoot 
the works. Naturally, this time we’re 
•opposed to chop off all the dead- 
wood, shove everything we’re work- 
ing on now onto the back burner, 
and pull that toy kit idea off the 
back burner and put it onto the 
front burner. Whenever we’re eager 
to do something, we’re supposed to 
let it congeal on the back burner. 
When we couldn’t care less about 
the thing, then we’re supposed to 
work on it. How does this fit in 
with your bright new idea?” 



“Not so hot What toy kit is 
that?” 

Heyden wrote: /. /. You mean 
Interdisciplinary Intellectronetics? Or 
Interspatial Ionics? 

He shoved the pad across the 
desk, then handed over the note 
from Grossrad. “Read it. You’ll re- 
member.” 

Benning crackled the paper, glanc- 
ed at the pad, wrote briefly, looked 
back at the note, wrote some more, 
glanced at the note and groaned. 

“Ye gods. Hasn’t somebody else 
got a Moon Krawler out by now? 
This thing was a bright idea when 
we thought of it. It’s stale now.” 
He slid the pad across, and Heyden 
read: 

I mean Interdis etc.-Jawbreaker 
Electronics , Inc. 

Heyden wrote, Where did you 
learn this? Aloud, he said, “Natur- 
ally, we’ll be supposed to gimmick 
it up with flashing lights, clicking 
noises, and a recorded voice like a 
talking doll, only more mechanical. 
No doubt the thing should have 
claws that open and shut, a power 
scoop for, quote, taking samples of 
the lunar surface, end-quote, and 
maybe a guide-wire to control it 
with as it crawls across the living- 
room rug waving its claws.”

-D sublime to the ridiculous in 
one easy jump.” He shoved the pad 
back. “WTiat’s this business about 
the $29.95 item? What toy could 
we make that anyone would be 
crazy enough to buy at that price?” 

Heyden was reading: Right from 
the horse* s mouth. Their Industrial

Intelligence chief. They're in some 
kind of financial cramp, want to 
cut his salary and slash his staff , 
“temporarily ” 

Heyden said, “Take a look through 
some recent toy catalog. You’ll get 
a shock.” He wrote, Is he reliable? 

Benning had been rapidly scan- 
ning Grossrad’s note, but was now 
reading it more carefully. He glanc- 
ed up in exasperation. “Listen to 
this: . of course, it shouldn’t fall 

apart before the holidays are over 
. Isn’t that nice?” He glanced at 
the pad, wrote rapidly, and said, 
“What kind of sleazy junk are we 
supposed to turn out, anyway?” 

“Just so it sells,” grunted Heyden. 
He took the pad, and read: That 
guy is as reliable as a rusted-out 
two-buck hair-trigger Spanish auto- 
matic. He just figures /. /. is double- 
crossing him, and he never lets any- 
body get ahead of him in that game. 

“You realize,” said Heyden, 
frowning, “we’re going to have to 
let some people go and that we’ll 
wish we’d kept them about eighteen 
months from now.” 

“Agh,” growled Benning, still read- 
ing the note. “Listen to this: ‘In- 
troduction of any new and revolu- 
tionary gimcrack at this time 
would, therefore, be most unwel- 
come and inexpedient.’ Just suppose 
we should hit on something new 
and revolutionary?” fie tipped his 
head toward the green-wrapped 
bundle. “Then what? Are we sup- 
posed to think you can actually put 
it in cold storage, and keep it like 
frozen fish? Suppose somebody else 
gets it? What’s the point of this 
whole thing, anyway?” 



Heyden wrote: Whafs in that 
bundle? He slid the pad across the 
desk, and said, “Let’s get back to 
the question of those people we’re 
going to have to let go.” 

Benning wrote on the pad, then 
said aloud, “This is crazy.” 

“Do you think,” said Heyden 
drily, “that you’re telling me some- 
thing?” He glanced at the pad: Lift 
off the paper and see. 

Heyden felt a tightness in his 
chest. He said, “Let’s have that note 
from Grossrad. I’ve been reading 
some of his previous stuff here — ” 
He stood up, gently pulled off the 
green paper — “and nobody can 
tell me anything new about how 
crazy — ” He stared at the short 
length of board with square box 
attached, and slide-wire rheostat be- 
side the box. Beneath the rheostat 
was a penciled arrow pointing to the 
right, and marked “Up”. 

T Tevden felt a brief spasm of ir- 
AA ritation. What was this sup- 
posed to be? Antigravity? He felt a 
brief wave of dizziness as he 
thought, Ye gods, what if it is? 

Belatedly, he finished his sen- 
tence: “ — how crazy a thing like 
this really is.” 

“But,” said Benning sourly, “we’re 
stuck with it? Is that what you 
mean?” 

“Yeah.” Heyden pulled the 
board toward him, noting its weird 
lightness, despite the fact that it 
felt solid enough to the fingers. 
“We’re stuck with it, and we better 
figure out who to let go.” 

“I should think,” said Benning, 
“that would be your job.”

Heyden shoved Ac rheostat slider 
in the direction of the arrow. The 
board drifted up out of his hands, 
and started accelerating toward the 
ceiling. A hasty grab brought it 
down, but it continued to tug toward 
the sky. 

“My responsibility ” said Hey- 
den, eyeing the board, “but I need 
your suggestions.” 

“As to who to fire?” 

“Say, as to who to keep” He slid 
the rheostat slider in the opposite 
direction, and the board sagged so 
heavily that it seemed to Heyden 
that it must be made out of solid 
lead. Frowning, he said, “Take 
Magnusson, for instance. We could 
unload him to start with, I suppose.” 
“He’s had a lot of expenses. His 
bank balance is pretty feeble.” 
Heyden was experimenting with 
the slider. He got the impression 
that as he approached either end, 
the weight or lift of the concealed 
device went off toward infinity. He 
paused to glance at the connections 
to the rheostat. 

“Not our fault,” he grunted. 

“No, but — ” 

“The point is, that’s his worry.” 
The board was headed for the 
ceiling again, and it felt as if it 
would tear Heyden’s arm out by 
the roots. Scowling, he pulled the 
slider back toward the center. 

Benning said, “I think we ought 
to be decent enough to give Mag- 
nuuson enough time to get back on 
his feet.” 

“How about Simms?” 

The board was so heavy Heyden 
had to rest it on the corner of his 
desk. As he pushed the slider furth- 



er, the board settled immovably in 
place, as if spiked down. 

“Well,” said Benning evasively, 
“Simms has had a little streak of 
bad luck, too.” 

“What have we got,” said Hey- 
den, carefully pulling the slider 
back, “nothing but hard-luck cases?” 
“Well, you know how. it is — ” 
“We’ve got to start somewhere ” 
“Sure, but poor Simms — ” 

“We aren’t going to get anywhere 
this way. Make out a list of the 
people you think are essential. I 
want them in groups, the most es- 
sential at the top of the list.” He 
wrote on the pad: Did 1.1.' s spy- 
chief say there was a visual pickup 
anywhere in here? 

Benning glanced at the pad. 
“What the heck, Jim. I can’t know 
which men are essential till I know 
what we’ll have to do later.” 

“Just assume it’s the usual thing, 
Ben. We’ve been through this be- 
fore.” He pulled the pad over, and 
read: 

He didn't say . Personally , I doubt 

it. 

Heyden wrote: We better explain 
this package , in case there's some- 
thing outside. 

Benning read it, and nodded. 
Heyden said, “Well, forget that 
for now. What have you got over 
there in that paper?” 

Benning shrugged. “A little pro- 
motion gizmo.” He rattled the pa- 
per. “See, you look in these port- 
holes, and you’re inside the space- 
ship. Shows our control panel, 
amongst other things, for the Genie 
Project.” 

“Cute,” conceded Heyden, smil-

ing wryly. “Well that’s down the 
drain now. Wrap it up and forget 
it.” 

“Based on the old-time stereo- 
scope,” said Benning, putting the 
actual board with its box and rheo- 
stat inside the paper wrapper. “Too 
bad. It seemed like a good — ” 
Heyden wrote on the pad, Let's 
go somewhere where wc can talk. 
Aloud, he said sourly, “1 ut it on 
the back burner. Now, I've had 
enough of this for a while. Where 
are you headed?” 

Benning glanced at the pad. “Back 
to my lab. You want to come 
along?” 

Heyden put Grossrad’s latest note 
in his pocket. “Sure.” 

Ill 

T hey went out, walked down a 
lengthy corridor, went into a 
big airy structure built on the gen- 
eral lines of a hangar for dirigibles, 
walked along the wall to the right, 
and finally arrived at a door marked, 
“Private — Danger — Keep Out.” 
Heyden followed Benning inside, 
and down a short hall. Benning did 
something complicated at the door, 
then they stepped in. Benning 
snapped on the lights, then flipped 
another switch, and the room filled 
with sounds of laughing voices, the 
clink of glasses, cars starting up 
somewhere in the background, and 
a close-at-hand murmur and mum- 
ble that seemed to include every 
tone of voice conceivable. 

“Okay,” murmured Benning, “I 
think this room is safe enough, but 
if they have got anything in here, 



they’re welcome to try and filter ut 
out from this mess. You did see 
what we’ve got, plainly enough, back 
in your office?” 

“I saw it. But did you see what 
we’re going to run into when we 
try to convince Grossrad?” 

“He couldn’t be so stupid he 
wouldn’t catch on to this.” 

“That’s not the point. He sayi 
new gadgets aren’t wanted. This 
means somebody higher up figures 
we’ve now settled down* to a nice 
international stalemate, with us 
ahead of the opposition. This de- 
vice. it strikes me, is going to make 
a lot of expensive equipment obso- 
lete in a hurry.” 

“You’re not just kidding. With 
this, we could put a man on the 
moon in a few weeks, not years 
from now. And that’s just the start.” 
“What the Sam Hill is it, any- 
way?” 

Benning frowned. “Did you ever 
hear the comparison of gravitational 
fields with the bending of a fric- 
tionless surface?” 

“I think I know what you mean. 
If you had a flat frictionless sur- 
face, flexible enough to bend when 
objects were placed on it, and if 
this whole frictionless surface were 
accelerating uniformly at right an- 
gles to the plane of the surface — ” 
Benning nodded. “That’s it.” 
Heyden went on. “If you had 
such a frictionless surface, an object 
would slide across it in a straight 
line until it neared another object, 
when the dip in the surface caused 
by these objects would pull them 
toward each other. There would be, 
apparently, a ‘gravitational field’ 




around each object, the strength of 
the ‘field’ depending on the mass of 
the object.” 

“Exactly. This would cause the 
effect of attraction. Now, how would 
you creat repulsion ?” 

“Well — ” Heyden frowned. 
“There would have to be a hill — a 
ridge, or rise, in the frictionless sur- 
face. You could do it only if the 
surface had some other property — 
if it were made of the right metal, 
for instance, you could position mag- 
nets toward the stern of a properly 
shaped object resting on the surface, 
and this might create enough slope 
to cause the object to slide for- 
ward—” 

Benning was nodding and smiling 
broadly. “That’s one idea. And how 
much power would it take?” 

“It would depend on the proper- 
ties of the surface.” 

“Yes. Well, we started this pro- 
ject without much hope that there 
was any physical counterpart to this 
comparison. But after tracking down 
some previously unexplained discre- 
pencies, we found it. The effect can 
be made comparatively large, the 
power consumption is small, and by 
proper manipulation, we can create 
either a positive or negative deflec- 
tion of the ‘surface’. The result is, 
we’ve got a space drive.” 

H eyden sat back, and thought it 
over. “This just could be a 
nightmare. How complicated is it?” 
“Mathematically, it’s very com- 
plicated. Physically, it’s not bad.” 
“This might make life very exas- 
perating for everybody concerned 
with it.” 



Benning frowned. “Of course, it’s 
bound to be highly classified. They’ll 
doubtless bury it under a ton of 
regulations, but — Oh.” Benning was 
silent. “Naturally, we discovered it 
We shouldn’t be running around at 
loose ends, ready to spill the works 
in the nearest bar.” 

“Naturally, that’s one aspect. But 
there are others. Now, how much 
leverage do you get with this thing? 
How much advantage over a rocket, 
for instance?” 

“Agh. Ye gods, a rocket.” 

“Could it beat a rocket for 
speed?” 

“Easy. Weight for weight — I 
mean weight at rest with the device 
turned off — there’s no comparison.” 
“How about for lifting a pay- 
load?” 

“There’s still no comparison. You 
don’t have to lift a lot of cargo 
you’re just going to fire out the tail 
end anyway.” 

“Could you put a warhead in one 
of these and hit within five miles 
a thousand miles away?” 

Benning hesitated. “Not yet.” 
“But eventually?” 

After a long silence, Benning said, 
“For accuracy, used as a missile 
power source, I fail to see any ad- 
vantage in this. But you could knock 
one of your opponent’s missiles off 
course with it. You might even 
smash it up in mid-air.” 

“How would you do that?” 

“Make one big enough, with 
enough power back of it, make a 
strong enough mount and screw the 
thing down to a solid base — What 
do you think you’ve got? It’s a 
tractor-repulsor unit. You can make 



HIGH G 



85 




a steep ‘hill’ in the ‘frictionless sur- 
face’ the missile is sliding along. 
What does that interpret as in phy- 
sical reality? A violent repulsion. 
Then you can make a trough. Sub- 
ject anything to sudden yanks and 
Aoves, and what happens to it?” 

Heyden nodded slowly. 

Benning said, “Didn’t I see you 
pick up Grossrad’s note before we 
left?” 

“Yes, you want it?” 

“I’d like to look it over again.” 

Heyden felt through his pockets, 
and handed the note to Benning. 

Benning read the note amidst 
gales of hurrying girlish laughter 
that grew loud and faded, with 
male curses, mumbling, a variety 
of audible conversations, and a 
weird varying note in the back- 
ground. 

Benning grunted and looked up. 
“He sure doesn’t leave any doubt 
about this ‘no new advances wanted 
at this time’.” 

Heyden nodded. “That’s what 
bothers me.” 

“But,” said Benning, “any good 
business man can see the potential 
in this.” 

“What potential? Where’s the 
profit in something you can never 
put Oil the market because it’s sure 
to be classified?” 

“Well, the defense contracts, 
then.” 

H eyden shook his head gloomily. 

“Remember: ‘we are now so 
far ahead of the international com- 
petition, defensewise, that no large 
new government orders can be ex- 
pected.’ ” 



Benning said angrily, “Can’t you 
convince that guy — ” 

“Probably, but so what? Grossrad 
doesn’t write contracts with himself. 
Suppose I convince him? Then he’s 
got to convince somebody else. That 
guy has to convince the next one. 
At some point in there, someone 
conceivably may have to convince 
the defense secretary, and he may 
have to convince Congress. This is 
assuming it goes through all those 
offices and ever comes out again. 
Each of those guys is going to be 
hard to convince, precisely because 
he knows how hard it’s going to be 
to convince the next man. Mean- 
while, all we can do is chew our 
nails and wait for their decision.” 
Benning said, “While we’re wait- 
ing, what if somebody else, say in 
some foreign laboratory, maybe even 
where they’ve got pictures of Big 
Brother hanging on the wall — What 
if they should come up with this?” 
“Is that conceivable?” 

“Sure, it’s conceivable. I told you, 
physically, this thing is not too bad.” 
He frowned. “Well, what then?” 
Heyden frowned. “As soon as 
they make it public, count on us to 
get a contract so big we couldn’t fill 
it if we were General Motors, U.S. 
Steel, and A. T. and T. combined. 
We’ll have to kidnap every scientist 
and technician we can lay our hands

on. 

Benning said angrily, “We’re 
missing something here. What if they 
don’t make it public? What if they 
quietly build up a fleet of these 
tilings while we’re sitting around 
waiting for the go-ahead? They 
could seal off outer space so tight

IF 




we’d never get out there.” An in- 
tense look appeared on Benning’s 
face. “Think, Jim — what if they’re 
building them right now?” 

Heyden blinked, gave an irritated 
wave of his hand as if to dismiss 
die thought, then frowned. “How 
hard is it to make these things?” 
“I’ve told you. The actual phy- 
sical construction isn’t too bad, once 
you know what to do.” 

There was a long period in which 
neither man said anything. Then 
Heyden said slowly, “You said, 
‘With this, we could put a man on 
the moon in a few weeks? Did you 
mean that literally?” 

Benning nodded. “Remember all 
die research that’s already been 
done. Think of the problems we 
don't have, because the drive is no 
worry. Think how we’re set up here. 
Sure, in three weeks, we could put 
a man on that moon.” 

“Could you mount the drive so it 
could also be used as a weapon?” 
“Yes. And, for that matter, a 
smaller one could serve as an aux- 
iliary weapon in flight, if you 
wanted. But it would take money.” 
Heyden thought it over, then 
grinned. “If Grossrad’s going to 
have his Kiddie Kits ready in time, 
he’s going to have to give us 
money.” 

“Are you serious?” 

“Yes, I’m serious. This is the big- 
gest technological advance in his- 
tory.” 

Benning was wide eyed. “And 
what you’re thinking of making is 
a full-size spaceship — good enough 
for an actual expedition?” 

“That’s exactly what I want — tf 



we can make such a thing. No trim. 
No flimflam. Just let it work.” 

Benning seemed to lose some en- 
thusiasm. “This is risky.” 

Heyden nodded. “You bet your 
life it’s risky. If Grossrad gets wind 
of it I’ll be hung from the rafters. 
But never mind that. Are you sure 
you can do it?” 

“Of course I’m sure,” Benning 
frowned. “Right now we can do 
this better than Kiddie Kits. A 
month from now, if we fellow 
Grossrad’s letter, it’ll be a different 
story. But — ” 

“Then this may be the only 
chance our side gets. We’d better 
take it.” 

Benning drew a deep shaky 
breath. “Okay.” 

IV 

T he next two weeks passed in a 
blur of desperate activity that 
left Heyden with no time to think of 
anything but the problem imme- 
diately in front of him. Benning’s 
remark that a man could be put on 
the moon in a few weeks turned out 
to be a little optimistic. 

Benning said exasperatedly, “I 
didn’t figure in all that life-support 
stuff. So far as the drive is con- 
cerned, that’s what I meant.” 
Heyden said angrily, “We could 
have put a corpse on the moon a 
long time ago.” 

“I’m sorry,” said Benning. “We’re 
coming fast, anyway. Thank heaven 
the thing is basically simple.” 

Before them loomed a big black 
ihape like an overgrown boiler. It 
had all the sophistication of a 



HIGH G 



87 




dedge-hammer, but Benning insisted 
k could take off inside a week. 

“You see,” he said, “the only 
real problem with the drive is dur- 
ability under stress. Theoretically, 
we could use that demonstration 
model I showed you. The trouble 
is that in practice if the drive-unit 
is too small, it will crush.” 

“That’s nice. But we’ve got 
around that, have we?” 

“Yes.” 

Heyden eyed the looming black 
boiler shape. “We don’t want to 
get out there” and get cooked. 

“The other side shades from black 
into a pure reflective coating.” 
“How do we see out of it? — In ad- 
dition to the radar, which may fail 
on us?” 

“There’s a window in the end. 
Also, we’re practising with a light- 
weight kind of drive-unit. We figure 
we can use that as a sort of de- 
tector.” 

“How does it work?” 

“To create a given negative bend- 
ing or warping where there’s a phys- 
ical object present takes more power 
than where there isn’t. Set things 
up right, and you can read the mass 
of the given object off a meter.” 
“How about distance?” 

“The reading drops in front and 
behind the object. There’s no prob- 
lem there.”. 

Heyden stared at the looming 
shape and nodded slowly. He had 
no clear idea why there was no 
problem there; but there was noth- 
ing to do but take Benning’s word 
for it, and hope things would turn 
out. He turned to make a final 
comment, then paused. 



A bulky overalled form had juft 
ducked out the door of the boiler- 
shape, and now, scowling deeply, 
pushed through a knot of people 
standing just outside. Carrying a 
flimsy sheet of yellow paper, he 
headed straight for Benning, and im- 
mediately got down to brass tacks. 

“That inside-drive idea won’t 
work. If we try that, we’re going 
to swivel that drive around, stress 
the walls, and crack the window on 
the end. That leaves us with an air- 
leak. That drive has to go outside ” 

4 4HPhat’s insane,” said Benning 
A angrily. “With that size 
unit, the whole ship’s inside the dis- 
tortion.” 

“Maybe, but there’s a fringe ef- 
fect.” 

“We’re inside it.” 

“We are? Look at this.” 

Benning took the paper. “WeH 
. This is just a freakish — ” 

“Maybe it doesn’t last long, but 
what’s it going to do to that win- 
dow?” 

“Yes, but if we put it outside* 
it will still — ” 

“Not if we have it on a boom. 
That puts us outside that gradient” 

Benning stared at him. “How 
long a boom?” 

“About two hundred feet should 
do it.” 

“Two hundred — ” 

“Unless you can breathe vacuum, 
that’s where it’s got to go, if we 
make it that size.” 

Benning was staring at the flim- 
sy sheet of paper as there came 
the sound of a feminine throat- 
clearing to Heyden’s right. He 



88 



IF 




glanced around to see his secretary 
holding out a special-delivery let- 
ter. Leaving Benning to deal with 
the technical problem, Heyden head- 
ed back to his office, and read the 
handwritten letter: 

Jim — 

Well, boy, we’ve got the mer- 
ger, but doing business with 
this outfit really puts your wal- 
let through the wringer. I hope 
you’re coming along fine with 
the Kiddie Kits. We’ll need 
every cent we can scrape up, so 
pare expenses to the bone, and 
shave everything just as fine 
as you can. We’re going to 
have to cut down more than I 
expected on the scientific talent, 
and I just hope we can pick 
them up again when we need 
them. 

I know how this Kiddie Kit 
business must strike you after 
the stuff we’ve been working 
on, but when the oasis gets this 
dry, there’s nothing to do but 
fold your tents and move on. 
Nothing we could produce, no 
matter how advanced, would 
get a really sympathetic hearing 
right now. 

I don’t mean to dwell on 
this, Jim. I know we can count 
on you all the way, even if it 
is a let-down. I keep harping 
on it because I think this toy 
business is going to make the 
difference, one way or the oth- 
er. It’s hard to believe, I know, 
but there it is. 

Ed and I are both totally 
worn out. There are some 



things that you have to do in 
business that aren't very busi- 
ness-like, but there’s no time 
to argue about that. You either 
do them or get kicked in the 
head, and somebody else walks 
off with the prize. 

I must be more worn-out 
than I realized to go on like 
this. Well, here’s to the merger, 
and stick to those Kddie Kits. 
You don’t know what it means 
to know we've got somebody 
back there we can count on. 

We’ll see you in a week, Jim. 

Stu 

Heyden swallowed and sat back 
dizzily. 

When his vision cleared, there 
stood, across the desk, an apologetic 
individual from Purchasing. “Sorry, 
sir, but it seems we have to have 
your signature on this.” 

Heyden took it, and scowled at 
the figures. “Are you sure the ad- 
dition is right?” 

“Yes, sir. That special silver wire 
is expensive stuff.” 

Heyden sat still for a moment, 
then scratched out his name. The 
paper was briskly whisked away. 

“Thank you, sir.” The door shut, 
and the incident was gone beyond 
recall. Heyden picked up the note, 
read it through again, and shook 
his head. He started to get up, then 
changed his mind. He sat still a 
minute, then drew in a deep breath 
and let it out in a rough sigh. The 
realization went through him with 
inescapable finality that in seven 
days the ship would be ready or not 
ready. 



NIGH G 



89 




And then something else, that 
he’d been vaguely aware of theo- 
retically took on a sudden solid- 
ness and reality. 

In seven days, he would be either 
a hero of broad vision, or a fool 
and a traitor. 

And there was not a thing he 
could do about it. 

He had made his move, and if it 
didn’t work out, he could never, 
never explain it. 

r ie first four or fivt days after 
that crawled past with Heyden 
almost in a daze. Time and again, 
between emergencies, he dredged up 
memories, trying to discover exact- 
ly how he had gotten into this. The 
astonishing thing was that, in ret- 
rospect, the decision seemed to have 
been so easy. Blandly, calmly, he 
had given the decision that might 
wreck the corporation, and land 
him, personally, in the worst mess 
he’d ever been in. 

His meditations were enlivened, 
toward the end of the week, by a 
telephone call from the comptroller. 
“Hello, Jim?” 

“Right here, Sam.” Heyden tried 
without success to inject a little 
warmth into his voice. His voice re- 
tained a calm unconcerned cool- 
ness. 

There was .a hesitant cough over 
the phone. “Say, no offense, Jim, 
but what the devil is going on 
there?” 

“Business as usual,” came Hey- 
den’s voice, cool and totally as- 
sured. “Granted the changes that 
I’m sure Stu must have told you 
about.” 



“Well, Stu told me — ” There was 
a brief pause. “Do you know some- 
thing I don’t know? Is that it?” 
Heyden laughed. The sound was 
that of a man without a worry in 
the world. “Sam,” his voice said 
cheerfully, “before I know if I know 
anything you don’t know, I know 
you know I have to know what 
you know, otherwise I won’t know, 
you know, if what I know is some- 
thing you don't know.” 

“Ah, for — ” Over the phone, the 
cautious voice sounded irritated but 
relieved. “Listen, we can kid all we 
want, but this is serious business.” 
“It is” said Heyden emphatical- 
ly. After a moment, he added, 
“Thank heaven.” 

“What do you mean? Wait a min- 
ute, now, do you mean — ” There 
was a long silence. “I know, of 
course, that the merger went 
through, but I didn’t realize — Do 
you mean that we’re frying their 
fish?” 

“All I can say is, this here is 
serious business. If Stu didn’t tel 
you, I’m not going into it over tbe 
phone.” 

“What if I come down there?” 
“Glad to see you anytime, Sam. 
But I can’t mention it if Stu did- 
n’t.” 

“Did Stu say, specifically, not to 
tell me?” 

“No. Of course not.” 

“Then why can’t you — ” 

“Because he didn’t tell me He 
mention it.” 

“Maybe I better call him up.” 

“No harm in it. Just don’t give 
anything away over the phone.” 
“Then how the devil am I — ”

Heyden said irritatedly, “Look, 
Sam, I’m sure it was an oversight 
on his part. Stu doesn’t make a 
practice of leaving anyone in the 
dark. But he was worn out. I don’t 
know what he had to do to put the 
merger across, but he seemed pretty 
thoroughly wrung out to me. Now, 
you can either try to locate him 
now, or you can wait a couple of 
days till he can tell you himself.” 
“All right. But meanwhile we’re 
spending — ” 

H eyden exploded. “What do I 
have to do, spell it out? For 
Pete’s sake, Sam! Look, do you 
think Stuart Grossrad is a commer- 
cial moron? With things the way 
they are now, would he deliberate- 
ly stretch us out as thin as a rub- 
ber band? This merger wasn’t a 
cheap proposition, you know.” 

“Well — the point of the merger 
was that, ultimately we’d reap the 
advantages of diversification.” 

“How would that get us through 
the next six months?” 

There was a lengthy silence. Fi- 
nally there was a long sigh over 
the telephone. “Did Stu tell you 
this beforehand?” 

“Beforehand, all he told me was 
such a tale of misery I almost 
drowned in my own tears. No. He 
didn’t tell me a thing, beforehand. 
What I couldn’t figure out was why 
he was so eager for this merger, if 
there wasn’t more in it than what 
he mentioned.” 

“He’s smooth, all right. He want- 
ed us psychologically set up to take 
full advantage of this. Or, if the 
merger fell through, he didn't want 



us moping around, thinking we’d 
lost our last chance. Either way it 
went, he was ready.” 

“I suppose that must have been 
it.” 

“Well — I just had to find out. No 
hard feelings, Jim?” 

“Of course not, Sam. Any time.” 
“See you, boy.” 

“So long, Sam.” 

Heyden put the phone in its 
cradle, and mopped his forehead. 
He had, if Sam remained convinced, 
succeeded in hanging on to two 
more days. If, that is, Grossrad 
didn’t decide to come back early. 
If there were no other catastrophes. 
Heyden glanced at his watch, and 
decided to go take a look and see 
how Benning was coming along. 

It took Heyden some time to 
walk down the long corridor, but 
only a few moments more to find 
his answer. The big boiler shape 
stood in solitary glory in the hangar- 
like building, apparently forgotten. 
Everyone was fifty feet away, 
crowded around a smouldering mess 
about a foot-and-a-half long and 
eight inches in diameter, and that 
had, apparently, once been some- 
thing useable. Benning had his hand 
at his chin, staring at his ruin. He, 
and the rest of the men, all looked 
so dazed and tired that Heyden 
didn’t have the heart to ask what 
had happened. Wearily, he shut 
the door, went back to his office, 
and sat down. 

“Well, Stu,” he said mentally, 
“you see I thought we could make 
it to the moon . Yes, the moon 
. Yes, I know the thing doesn't 
work, Stu . That’s where all

IF 




the money went Stu . That's 
right . Yes, Stu . Sorry 
. Yes . That’s right, Stu 
— I mean Mr. Grossrad ... Yes, 
Mr. Grossrad, I did it on my own 
responsibility ... Yes, sir, I know, 
but — You see, sir, if somebody else 
had got it — And if it had worked, 
Mr. Grossrad, then ... I know it 
didn’t sir, but — ” 

Heyden abruptly sat up, and 
smashed his fist on the desk. “Damn 
it,” he said savagely, “it’s got to 
work!” 

B y the time he got to Benning 
again, Benning looked glassy- 
eyed with pure stupefaction, and the 
others had expressions that varied 
from ordinary gloom to total de- 
featist resignation. 

Heyden told himself that he 
would have to keep himself under 
tight control. 

“What’s this?” he said abruptly, 
and a good deal louder than he'd 
intended. 

Instantly, every eye in the room 
was focused on him. They watched 
him with the alert attention a man 
gets when he breaks the silence by 
cracking a bullwhip. 

Benning turned around, his ex- 
pression that of bafflement and dis- 
belief. “This size builds up heat 
faster than we imagined. It’s got 
to have a cooling system.” 

“Is that the drive-unit for the 
ship?” 

“No, this is the forward unit. The 
ship drive-unit is bound to be worse 
yet.” 

“How long to rig up a cooling 
system?” 

HIGH G 



“Too long. We’ve not only got to 
cool the drive-unit itself, we’ve then 
got to unload all the heat from the 
cooling system. The stupefying thing 
is, we tested for this with smaller 
units, and the heat build-up was 
gradual and well within bounds. 
We’ve apparently run into some ef- 
fect that increases exponentially with 
mass, while thrust — ” 

“Can you get the same thrust 
with a group of small units as with 
one large one?” 

Benning blinked. “It wouldn't be 
as efficient , but yes, we could do 
that.” 

“Any drawbacks to having a 
bunch of them?” 

“Yes. All the mounts have to be 
duplicated — ” 

“Why not mount them together?” 
“If they’re too close, we’ve dis- 
covered they interact.” 

“Can you mount them far enough 
apart so they don’t interact, but not 
so far apart as to make control im- 
possible?” 

“Yes, but the expense — ” 

“Damn the expense,” said Hey- 
den savagely. “How long will it 
take?” 

Benning mopped his forehead. 
“If we work straight through with- 
out a break we can have it ready 
the day after tomorrow.” 

“All right. Starting now, every- 
one who volunteers to work straight 
through, and who sticks with it, 
gets a quadruple pay, and a thou- 
sand-dollar bonus after taxes, if the 
job’s done on time.” 

There was a brief sudden buzz 
of excitement. 

“My God!” blurted Benning. 

n 




“Look what’s at stake!” said Hey- 
den angrily. “Control of space! A 
drive that can reach the planets! 
All the high-grade ore in the aster- 
oid belt! — Are we going to fold up, 
or are we going to get it?” He 
paused just long enough to see the 
glint in their eyes, then turned to 
Benning. “What do you need?” 
Benning said soberly. “A list as 
long as your arm.” 

“Let’s have it.” 

Benning got him off away from 
the others. “Listen, do you know 
what’s going to happen to you if — ” 
“It’s too late for that.” 

“I wish I’d never brought that 
damned thing to your office.” 
“We’ve taken a flying jump, and 
we’re now halfway out over the 
crevasse. There’s no point wishing 
we’d never jumped. We’ve got to 
go the rest of the way and put our 
mind on grabbing any bush or 
clump of grass that will get us 
over the lip of that drop.” 

Benning swallowed. “Okay.” 
“Now listen,” said Heyden. 
“You’re going to need plenty of hot 
coffee in here, and I don’t know if 
you can literally keep going withr 
out any break. We don’t want a 
bunch of zombies staggering around 
in here holding the wrong end of 
the wrench.” 

“You’re right. Could we have 
tome rough army blankets and some 
narrow folding cots? That’s heaven 
for an exhausted man, but he 
shouldn’t be too reluctant to get up.” 
“Good idea. Now can you fin- 
ish it by the day after tomorrow?” 
Benning nodded. “If, God will- 
ing, nothing else goes wrong.” 



V 

T he next day was a nightmare. 

Suppliers were beginning to 
need reassurance about pay. A weird 
rumor was making the rounds, to 
the effect that Grossrad had stripped 
the corporation treasury and was 
now settled down in Brazil with a 
nicely tanned blonde mistress, the 
two of them living cozily in a man- 
sion with an Olympic-sized swim- 
ming pool outdoors, and gold-plated 
faucets indoors. 

Heyden put the rumor down tem- 
porarily by showing the two hand- 
addressed envelopes from Gross- 
rad, with their recent postmarks, 
but the rumor failed to stay down. 
It popped up again with new refine- 
ments. Someone who looked just like 
Grossrad had been seen in Brazil 
by Milton Sharpbinder, vice-presi- 
dent of Interdisciplinary Intellec- 
tronetics, and Milton had imme- 
diately called back to sell his hold- 
ings in Continental Multitechnikon 
before the bottom fell out. Some- 
body else had actually been out 
near Grossrad’s Brazilian mansion, 
and had seen him lolling with a 
bottle in a deck chair while the 
blonde did laps in the Olympic- 
sized pool. 

The details mounted up fantas- 
tically. Grossrad had been seen 
wheeling around the streets of Rio 
driving a Mercedes-Benz roadster. 
Later information had it that it was 
a 1959 300SL Mercedez-Benz with 
removable hardtop, and Grossrad 
was gripping a long thin cigar be- 
tween his teeth, and had one arm 
casually around the blonde. Some-

IF 




how, the burgeoning details added 
further solidity to the rumor, which 
grew yet more solid as Grossrad 
moved on and was seen with the 
blonde at Copacabana. 

That this was not just a local 
rumor developed as Continental 
Multitechnikon began to slide on 
the stock market while other space 
•tocks were creeping upward. This, 
in turn, seemed to support the 
rumor. In the midst of this, with 
suppliers demanding payment in 
solid-gold bars on delivery, the 
phone rang and a familiar voice 
jumped out: 

“Say, Heyden, what the hell is 
going on out there? I just got a 
phone call from Sam, and he’s — ” 

“Stu?” shouted Heyden, his voice 
filled with synthetic delight. “Hello? 
Is that you?” 

“Is it me? Who the—” 

“Hold on! Listen, we’ve got a 
bunch of guys here who think — 
wait a minute. Where are you call- 
ing from?” 

“Where am I calling from? Santa 
Barbara. What about it? Listen, 
what — ” 

“Where have you been the last 
week?” 

“I’ve been holed up, getting over 
what we had to go through to get 
that merger across, what do you 
think? Didn’t you get my letter? 
Listen, what the — ” 

“We’ve got a bunch of guys here 
that claim they don’t supply us, be- 
cause you’re down in Brazil with a 
blonde, rolling around in a Mer- 
cedes 300SL.” 

“I’m what?” 

Before Heyden could say any- 



thing, one of the men in the room 
said nervously, “Is that him? How 
do we know — ” 

Heyden said, “I don’t know if yoH 
heard that, Stu. They think maybe 
this isn’t you. Could you talk to a 
few of these — ” 

“Wait a minute now. What is this? 
I don’t get this.” 

4 4 T) race yourself. There’s a 
rumor afloat that you’ve dis- 
appeared, vanished completely, and 
someone like you has been seen in 
Rio by — get this, Stu — by Milton 
Sharpbinder, who immediately 
dumped all his holdings in Contin- 
ental before the news of what had 
happened got out — ” 

“Sharpbinder, eh?” 

“Yes, and someone else definitely 
saw you living in a mansion down 
there with gold plumbing and a big 
swimming pool. It seems you were 
outside by the pool, taking the sun, 
watching this blonde plow back and 
forth—” 

Grossrad laughed. 

Heyden said, “Before you laugh 
this off have you taken a look at 
the financial page lately?” 

On the other end of the line, 
Grossrad was starting to have hys- 
teria, but that brought him around. 

“No,” he said, “that’s one thing 
I haven* t been doing. I’ve been try- 
ing to get a rest. Is this stupid play 
by Sharpbinder actually — ” 

“We’re going down. Everybody 
else is going up.” 

“That boob is just one week too 
late to hurt us. If this drop had 
come last week, without our hav- 
ing any idea what was wrong — ”

“Just the same, I still don’t think 
it would hurt if you showed your- 
self out there.” 

“I will. Now, let me speak to a 
few of these boys that think I’m in 
Brazil.” 

Heyden said, “Okay,” and held 
out the phone. 

A few minutes later, Grossrad 
was saying to Heyden, “I had no 
idea this was the trouble. Sam went 
through all kinds of verbal contor- 
tions trying to tell me something 
without giving away anything. The 
impression I got was that you were 
making off with the treasury, not 
me.” He laughed. “I was relieved 
to even hear your voice.” 

Heyden laughed. “/ was relieved 
to hear you. I was starting to be- 
lieve this business about the blonde.” 
Grossrad laughed so hard Hey- 
den had to hold the phone out away 
from his ear. Then Grossrad, half- 
choked, said, “Say, Jim, you won’t 
skip out now? You will be there 
when I get back?” 

“Either here, or halfway to the 
moon.” 

“I know what you mean.” Gross- 
rad burst out laughing again. “I was 
in orbit myself for a little bit there. 
Well, so long, Jim. I’m going out 
and make myself public.” 

Heyden felt like a hollow shell as 
he put the phone back in its cradle. 
But, with an effort of will, he looked 
deliberately around the room, and 
studied the shamefaced glances that 
looked back at him. 

“Now,” he said, with forced calm, 
“can we go back to doing business 
on a normal basis?” 

No one offered any objection. 



T he needed supplies came in, but 
the tension failed to ease. The 
final day was the worst. The comp- 
troller came to Heyden’s office while 
Heyden was on pins and needles to 
go see Benning, and it was a precious 
half-hour before Heyden could get 
free. Then, just as he was leaving 
his office, a telegram arrived from 
Grossrad telling when he would be 
back. Heyden glanced at his watch 
and saw with a shock that he had 
only two hours and fifteen minutes 
left. If he wasn’t at the airport, 
Grossrad would be puzzled, and 
then curious. If he was at the air- 
port, Grossrad would be bound to 
question him about the Kiddie Kits, 
and the lack of work he had done 
on them would show up quickly. 
Either way, the lid would be off in- 
side an hour more at the longest. 
That gave him three hours and fif- 
teen minutes. 

Heyden sucked in a deep breath, 
forced himself to look brisk and 
confident, and went to see Benning. 

He found Benning slumped on a 
bench with his head in his hands. 

Heyden stared around. A number 
of men were asleep on cots, or rolled 
up in a blanket on the floor. Several 
were at the big coffee boiler filling 
their cups. 

Heyden looked at the spaceship. 
Despite what he’d said about for- 
getting appearance, the overgrown- 
boiler look had been softened, at 
least from this angle. There was a 
shining silvery surface, that shaded 
off to one side. Heyden blinked, and 
glanced at Benning. 

“Say, you’ve moved this?” 
Benning looked up drearily.

IF 




Heyden glanced uneasily back at 
tile spaceship, with its radiating arms 
holding what must be the drive- 
units. 

“Ben — ” he said. “It’s all right, 
isn’t it?” 

Benning looked down at the 
ground. “It doesn’t work.” 

Heyden shut his eyes. 

Benning’s voice reached him. “I’m 
so tired I can’t think. It worked 
once. We rotated the ship on min- 
imum power. It was smooth — per- 
fect. And it apparently burned some- 
thing out. We’re all half-dead. We’ve 
checked and checked — ” 

Heyden forced himself to be 
sympathetic. “You’ve been work- 
ing overtime for three weeks.” He 
sucked in a long breath. “Is every- 
thin o on board that I had on that 
list?” 

“Everything. But it doesn’t work. 
There’s no response at all.” 

“How long to fix it?” 

“We’ll have to tear it down com- 
pletely.” 

“How long?” 

“Another three weeks.” 

Heyden sank down onto the bench 
beside Benning. 

“Oh, God,” said Benning miser- 
ably. “Jim, I’m so sorry I got you 
into this.” 

“Yeah,” said Heyden. 

“It’s a flop,” said Benning. “We 
should have taken more time to test 
it. We ran off half-cocked.” 

TJeyden didn’t say anything. 

-ti- Benning said, “All that money. 
I’m so sorry, Jim. What will Gross- 
rad do?” 

Heyden shut his eyes. 



Benning’s voice came through. 
“We must have been crazy. That’s 
the only explanation. No one ever 
does anything like this. Well, now 
we pay the piper.” 

Heyden dizzily looked up to see 
the big shiny boiler through a haze. 
Someone was leaning out the door, 
and put his hands to his mouth like 
a megaphone. 

“Hey, Chief. The trouble is, 
somebody left this master switch 
open, back of the control panel.” 

Benning sat paralyzed for an in- 
stant, then sprang from the bench 
He was across the floor and inside 
the ship before Heyden realized 
what had happened. 

Slowly, the meaning seeped 
through to Heyden. He watched. 

The big silver form lifted, hov- 
ered, and then smoothly rotated, the 
radiating arms swinging around like 
the spokes of a giant wheel, the cen- 
tral hub shading from silver to gray 
to black, then back to silver again. 
Smoothly it settled down, with a 
faint grating crunch. 

Heyden stood up. Across the 
room, the sound of that faint crunch 
turned men around at the coffee 
boiler. An instant later, they recog- 
nized the ship’s changed position, 
set their cups down with a bang, 
let out a wild yell, and ran to wake 
up the men on the cots and stretched 
out on the floor. 

Heyden was still fervently thank- 
ing God when the men burst into 
cheers. Then Benning was wringing 
him by the hand. All around the 
huge room, it seemed that people 
were banging each other on the 
back.

Heyden sucked in a deep breath. 
“Listen, when can we take off?” 

“Take off?” Benning looked 
blank. “We’re finished. The thing’s 
ready. It’s completed, and it works.” 

Heyden stared at him. “Do we 
talk different languages? What do 
you think we’re going to do now?” 

Benning stared at him. “Show it 
to Grossrad. It’s finished. It works. 
He’ll see—” 

Heyden opened his mouth and 
shut it with a click. “You remem- 
ber what 1 said we wanted? — A full- 
size actual spaceship, so far as we 
could make such a thing. Now that 
we’ve got it, you think we’re going 
to just show it to Grossrad? What 
good would that do? Outer space is 
in our hands, now, if that ship will 
do what we think it will do. And 
yet, what can Grossrad do with it 
but use it as a working model? What 
good does that do?” 

Benning swallowed. “You mean, 
we — ” 

“Who else? Have we gone through 
all this to quit now? We have to 
carry this through all the way to 
the finish.” 

Benning paled. “I thought we 
were going to make a demonstra- 
tion—” 

“We are. When can we take 
off?” 

“I thought all that food and the 
cargo and that other gear was just 
to make it look good. More realistic. 
More — ” 

“The idea is to keep us from 
starving out there, and to fix it so 
we can get some use out of this. 
Will that radio work?” 

“Everything should work.” 



“Then,” said Heyden, “let’s get a 
crew and get out of here before 
something else goes wrong. It 

shouldn’t be hard to get volunteers, 
should it? Can you pick the men 
who'll be most help to us?” 

Benning grinned suddenly. “We’re 
going to try to do this like Lind- 
bergh?” 

“Why not?” 

“What about germs on the moon? 
What about — ” 

Heyden said brutally, ‘“If you 

don’t want to go, say so now.” 
Benning paused. “I want to go.” 
“Then pick the crew while I write 
a note to Grossrad.” 

B enning nodded, and started over 

toward the coffee boiler. Hey- 

den whirled, and went back to his 
office. He yanked out a sheet of 
paper, and wrote fast: 

Stu — 

When you receive this, we 
should be, as I jokingly said 
earlier, on our way to the 
moon. Only, this is real. 

Now, this is the first com- 
mercial venture into space, and 
no doubt the Government will 
blow all its fuses. Nevertheless, 
it is up to us to make it pay. 
First, I’m afraid that at the 
moment we’re in something of a 
hole, financially; but we have 
powerful radios, along with 
enough lights and selected 
chemicals to make ourselves 
seen, and it seems to me there 
are a few commercial outfits 
around that ought to be happy 
to pay through the nose to have 



98 



IF 




a commercial beamed toward 
earth from the moon. 

Charge more for the visual 
stuff, Stu. When the Govern- 
ment screams, point out that 
they will get their cut of the 
profits in due time. 

There is doubtless a whole 
lot of rock and dust on the 
moon that it wouldn’t break 
our backs to load into the ship, 
and that would sell for a price 
per pound to rival solid plati- 
num, but I’m sure there will be 
objections to that. 

As the next best thing, I’ve 
gotten a large quantity of thin 
sheet metal and loaded it on 
board. While we’re out there, 
we will orbit the moon. When 
we come back, we can stamp 
out millions of little flat space- 
ship models, which can be col- 
ored suitably and molded in 
plastic for souvenirs. Bear in 
mind, each one of these will 
have been around the moon 
and back. 

Next, we have a large cargo 
of fabric, Stu, which will also 
go around the moon, and can 
be cut up into moon scarves 
and moon dresses when we get 
back. 

Figure out what you can 
make on this, without having to 
charge anybody more than he 
will cheerfully pay for the 
vicarious pleasure of taking 
part in this trip. If this doesn’t 
cover expenses, and leave 
enough over for handsome 
bonuses all around, I’ll be sur- 
prised. 



Incidentally, you might put 
tome of this money into a spe- 
cial fund — I may need it for 
bail bond. 

Jim 

Heyden put the letter in an. en- 
velope, wrote Grossrad’s name on 
the outside, and gave it to his sec- 
retary to deliver. 

He went back down the corridor, 
found Benning waiting with his 
chosen crew, and climbed on board. 
The ship slid smoothly and easily 
out the big opened doors, paused 
momentarily, and then the ground 
began to fall away. 

Heyden was beginning to have 
doubts. He stepped back as Ben- 
ning shut the door, and said, “How 
are the odds on our getting out there 
and having some little thing strand 
us a hundred thousand miles from 
home?” 

“Surprisingly poor,” said Ben- 
ning, “assuming we can count on 
odds at all when we’re dealing with 
something this new.” 

“Why? I mean, why are the odds 
against us poor?” 

“The amount of weight we can 
lift with this drive. Suppose just half 
the weight that goes into die lower 
stages of a chemical rocket could 
be added to the payload. Think of 
the added space, stronger materials, 
spares, and general increased mar- 
gin of safety. After you work on 
stuff to be lifted by rocket, this is 
a dream.” 

H eyden relaxed and glanced 

around. They were standing in 
a small chamber with a second door 



99 




partly open behind them He be- 
came conscious of a continued sen- 
sation like that of rising in a very 
fast elevator. 

Benning said, “All the same, this 
Is incredible, in a way.” 

“That — we hope — weTe going to 
the moon?” 

“No, we’re used to that idea, fan- 
tastic as it would have seemed a 
few years ago.” He frowned “No, 
It’s — it’s — ” 

Heyden suddenly caught his 
thought. “That we’re just doing it?” 

Benning sighed. “Yes. Without 
filling out forms in quintuplicate. 
Without stewing over it. Without a 
hundred changes of direction and 
reevaluations.” 

Heyden nodded. “But that’s sup- 
posed to be more ‘scientific’.” 

“It’s more bureaucratic, anyway. 
But even if a method is more scien- 
tific, that’s beside the point. The 
point is to get the job done ” said 
Benning. 

He stood thinking back to that 
endless interval when the ship sat 
dead on the ground and Benning 
told him the whole thing was a 
failure, and when the weight of 
failure crushed him down. Then he’d 
learned in his bones the penalty of 
following one’s own judgment 



against the shrewd decisions of su- 
periors — when one’s own judgment 
turns out to be wrong. 

But now, beneath his feet he 
could feel the solid unvarying thrust, 
lifting them up at constant accelera- 
tion and steadily increasing speed. 

Down far below now were the 
nations of the earth, run by monster 
bureaucracies made up of many 
people who hesitated — partly be- 
cause they sensed the awful penalty 
for failure — to take the risk of 
questioning even the most self-de- 
feating procedures. 

And yet, here were Heyden and 
Benning and their men, high above 
the bureaucrats, and rising higher 
fast, because they had risked dis- 
grace and disaster. They were only 
here by the skin of their teeth, and 
Heyden was beginning to realize 
from his reaction just how long he 
would think before taking a risk 
like that again. 

But, all the same, they were 
here . 

“Come on,” said Heyden, walking 
a little heavily under the steadily 
maintained thrust. “Let’s either get 
to a place where we can sit down, 
or go up front to that window. 
Maybe we could see the moon.”

THE 

FOLLOWERS 

by BASH WELLS 



B alt Dormer was conscious of 
the muted thunder of blood 
in his ears as he stretched out on 
the sleeping plate. In vain he tried 
to relax the lank five feet of his 
spare frame as he dropped the 
colorless hood of the mentrol unit 
over his head and upper torso. 

In a matter of minutes he would 
be walking outside the A valoris 
inner cabins — moving through a 
lacy blue-green jungle to his rendez- 
vous with the disturbingly shapely 
Halden called Alno. 



His mind roamed the planet in a 

carcass of steel — while his own 
body stayed safely in the rocketl 



His sweaty fingers fumbled the 
knobs and studs that connected bis 
mind with the super mech nick- 
named Cass. Once the contact was 
established he could forget that he 
was a graying little technician — 
plain-featured, stooped, and timid. 

Ernest Lytte, senior member of 
the planet-mapping spacer’s crew of 
three, would be busy for three or 
four hours, with his records. And 
Jefferson Carney, the fair-skinned, 
bluff giant, was on his own sleeping 
plate, his- mentrols linked with the 



101 



•oper mech, Herk. He was free far 
two or three hours . 

He moved forward out of the re- 
taining clamps. For a brief moment 
lie was yet Balt Donner, marveling 
at his handsome seven-foot frame 
and at the sleek bronzed pseudo- 
flesh with the powerful warm mus- 
cles rippling beneath. And then he 
was Cass: super mech, humanoid 
robot, mentrol-linked extension of 
Balt Donner’s brain. 

Only faintly, in the dim reaches 
of his brain, did he recall that he 
was actually a thinning-haired wisp 
of a man. Now he identified him- 
self as the thousand-pound godlike 
being named Cass. 

He checked his paralysis gun, 
holstered at his hip, and patted the 
zippered pouches that formed his 
only garmenture here on Hald. 

The humanoids of this uncharted 
fourth planet of Greth II went un- 
clad even as Cass. And the policy 
of star mappers is always to mingle 
as unobtrusively as possible with the 
native races. For this same reason 
Cass’ well-shaped nose had vanished 
into blank tanned flesh, and he 
•ported Haldian-type nostrils below 
cither elongated ear. 

The triple airlocks sucked softly 
shut behind him and he stood upon 
the springy bluish sward of the 
hillock’s treeless crown. 

And below him, to the right of 
the well-trodden path to the marshy 
lowlands where the Haldians built 
their slime-daubed villages, he 
caught a glimpse of a furtive heart- 
•haped face among the leaves of a 
•carlet-flowered thicket. 

He hurried toward the face. And 



now it was fully revealed, and the 
curving loveliness of the feminine 
body belonging with it. 

“Azaa, Cass!” the hidden one’s 
liquid voice welcomed. 

“Azaa, Alno,” Cass replied. Forty 
hours with the banks of speech 
analyzers and recorders of the great 
ship briefing him in the simple lan- 
guage gave him a working knowl- 
edge of this Haldian tongue. 

“I saw the huge one you call Herk 
leave the god cocoon.” She shivered 
daintily, daintily although she lacked 
but inches of his own seven feet of 
height. 

“I have great fear of him.” She 
came closer, trembling. 

Cass chuckled, his deep voice a 
mellow rumble of thunder. He put 
his arm around the shoulders of the 
girl as she turned wide violet eyes 
upward. Momentarily he winced at 
the alien smoothness of her noseless 
features. Yet she was beautiful. He 
loosed her. 

“Herk will not harm you,” he 
assured Alno. “Any more than will 
I.” 

They started walking away from 
the ship in its hilltop clearing, Cass 
thrilling to the admiration of the girl 
at his side. To Cass, or, more 
realistically, Balt Donner, such in- 
terest was heady as whiffed oxygen. 
In all his forty-odd years only his 
mother had ever admired or kissed 
the homely little Terran. 

“Perhaps,” said Alno wistfully, “I 
will not long be an Outcast here on 
your hill, Cass. One of the People, 
Great Arm, has fallen into a pit. 
If he dies his Follower will come 
for me.” 



102 



IF 




“You do not sound happy, Little 
Tree Flower,” Cass said. “When first 
we met you were weeping because 
your Follower had died beneath a 
fallen tree.” 

“I know. I was banished from the 
village until once again I overcame 
my sin of being twinless. And the 
only other Outcasts were two old 
men. Never had Followers claimed 
them again.” 

“Yetlnow when you may be free 
to return — ?” 

“I could no longer visit you, Cass. 
Outcast and one of the People do 
not speak together. Rather would I 
remain Outcast and be near you.” 

Cass’ reactions to Alno’s words 
were not typical of Earth men in 
Bah Donner. And by the time he 
had decided to venture a friendly 
embrace, Alno was a dozen paces 
ahead of him, peering on tiptoe into 
a papery black nest of skull-shaped 
material. 

“Three tiny vutaas!” she chortled 
happily, and her slim rounded arm 
disappeared into the hollow nest. 

The vutaa she held was feather- 
less, colorless and plump as a huge 
grub, and its ugly stub-billed head 
was gaping hungrily. Alno daintily 
bit off the craning neck, spat and 
crunched greedily at the tender 
flesh. 

Cass felt what should have been 
a stomach turning over. For the mo- 
ment he was gripped by a sick 
revulsion against space, the ten 
years of planet-mapping, the con- 
stant growing hatred of his two 
superiors aboard the Avalon and the 
alien and quasi-humanoid races they 
contacted. 



If he were only back on Earth 
again at his accustomed technician’s 
job in the testing laboratories of 
Super Mechs Inc . 

A lno — “Little Tree Flower” — 
in the tongue of Hald — 
screamed and dropped the clean-pick- 
ed bones of the bird. She spun about 
and darted toward CaSs. 

“The serpent!” she screeched, cast- 
ing quick glances backward. 

Cass shook himself and stepped 
past the terrified girl. 

Whipping from the concealing 
undergrowth beyond the dangling 
dark nest came a sinuous, blood- 
hued, saurian head and scaly neck. 
White shards of fangs glistened in 
the yellow moistness of that gaping 
mouth. A yellowish muscular rope 
was its tongue. 

Wisdom dictated that he use the 
paralysis gun. Instead he opened his 
big long-fingered hands and waited. 
He felt that he must pit the might 
of this giant’s body against some 
tangible foe or go mad. 

Ernest Lytte fought the cumula- 
tive pull of space madness with 
ever-increasing doses of drugs, and 
Jeff Carney struggled along with 
alcohol and forbidden carousing on 
humanoid planets enroute. But until 
now the third member of the Avalon 
had kept his balance near Earth 
Normal with his work and the sev- 
eral hundred spools of teleview 
adventure recordings that had been 
brought along. 

The neck elongated, swaying 
nearer. The neck became the body, 
no larger around than Cass’ body 
but thirty or forty feet in length. 



THE FOLLOWERS 



10S 




Stubby, double-jointed legs, tour- 
clawed, studded the ridged serpent’s 
belly. Dozens of them. 

Cass clamped his hands back of 
the hideous head. He squeezed, his 
hands sinking deep. The coils writh- 
ed, wrapping about him tautly, even 
as his hands ripped the reptile’s head 
free. He tore away the entangling 
coils, glorying in the unhuman 
Strength and cunning of those robot 
fingers. This was all his timid dreams 
of heroism come to life. 

“Cass! Cass!” Alno’s voice reach- 
ed his ears at last. “The People 
come! They hunted the serpent. We 
must go.” 

Cass tore a velvety fern-like 
growth from the path’s edge and 
wiped the blood from his bronzed 
flesh. His eyes studied the spear- 
armed People who now pushed into 
the path’s opening. 

Tall they were, their noseless 
faces and elongated ears accenting 
the perfection of their naked bodies. 
And with them, close to the heels 
of each seven foot native, trotted 
the rounded intelligent beasts, the 
Followers. 

But two feet in diameter were the 
Followers, their four pudgy legs and 
four diminutive upper limbs less 
than a foot in length. Yet their two 
shallowly set eyes, pale blue and 
unwinking, and their slim ears lift- 
ing through a tangle of early black 
hair were all too repellently human 
to Cass. 

None of the People or the Fol- 
lowers paid any heed to Cass or the 
girl. They were Outcasts, taboo, be- 
cause they had no Followers. They 
were out of step in the peculiar 



system of three sexes on Hale And 
so, to the People and their gro- 
tesque doglike companions, they did 
not exist. 

A lno and Cass hurried on down 
the path toward the edge of 
the swampy lakes rimming the hill. 

“I still cannot understand it, Alno,” 
Cass muttered. “How two so unlike 
creatures could be born of the 
same mother. You are four-limbed 
— they are eight-limbed.” 

“Always was it so,” the girl smile. 
“But do not the Outcasts, those 
without Followers, have young?” 
“Perhaps.” She smiled, invitingly at 
Cass. “You are strong, Cass. Much 
stronger than any of the People in 
my village.” 

Cass was not to be diverted. He 
wished to know more. 

“The Followers are born of the 
same mothers as the People?” 
Alno’s wide violet eyes were puz- 
zled. 

“Naturally.” She frowned at Cass. 
“You must know that. Sureiy all 
your villages on Earth have twins 
who are Followers! Only poor dumb 
beasts have no twins.” 

“You — you’ve been there.” Cass 
was fumbling for words. “When 
babies were born — you’ve helped?” 
The girl’s mouth dropped. She 
gave a startled little cry and then 
she was laughing merrily. 

“You are making fun with me 
now,” she accused, “for of course 
you know that only Followers care 
for mothers and their young.” 

Cass grunted something. “Of 
course. But I wondered whether 
your customs were not different.” 



104 



IF 




“How could they be?” Alno’s un- 
comprehending face was pouting. 
“The People are the same anywhere. 
If they were not they would not be 
the People.” 

The path ended where a ridge of 
moss-grown grayish granite pushed 
out into the semi-fluid green soup 
of mingled water and aquatic plants. 
They sat down on a convenient 
ledge, the water lapping choppily at 
the rocks twenty feet below. 

“A Swimmer!” whispered Alno in 
an awed voice, her eyes fixed on a 
spot a hundred feet or more from 
shore. 

Cass sighted the Swimmer’s grace- 
ful golden-green body. In all the 
eighty hours of their stay on Hald 
they had seen but two other Swim- 
mers. Lytte and Carney’s theory was 
that these sacred almost-gods were 
a very rare and intelligent race of 
amphibians. 

He caught an impression of gold- 
en-flecked blue eyes, wise eyes, in a 
weirdly unhuman face. Flippers, or 
blunt limbs, propelled the drifting 
Swimmer leisurely along. And the 
mysterious swimming creature was 
eight-limbed. Of that he was posi- 
tive. 

“Another — and another!” Alno’s 
hushed voice thrilled Cass. She clung 
to the super mech’s muscular arm. 

Cass watched the weird creatures 
of the warm seas of Hald until they 
dove at last beneath the floating 
green surface and disappeared. One 
part of his mind was busy with the 
puzzling alien life of this planet — 
but another portion was all-too con- 
scious of the warmth and softness 
of the female’s body at his side. 



Clumsily he encircled her waist 
His handsome noseless face came 
down upon her own, and their lips 
met. He did not lose the illusion of 
being Cass. All the sensations of 
taste, smell, warmth and pain trans- 
mitted faithfully through the men- 
trols. 

And then memory of the vutaa’s 
headless body, these satne lips blood- 
ied by the bird-thing’s raw flesh, 
came to him. He pushed away, stood 
up. Suddenly he was just a middle- 
aged, slightly muddled little man 
controlling a robot, and she was a 
savage alien. 

Cass sighed, his feet oddly heavy 
as he turned to go. 

“Time I was getting back, Alno.” 

T he forty hours of Haldian day- 
light were almost ended. Balt 
Donner was working thoughtfully at 
a delicate bit of control mechanism, 
and Jeff Carney had just returned 
from a routine tour of the great 
ship’s outer storerooms and holds. 
Always, after a session with the 
mentrol-controlled robot, Herk, he 
worked off the nervous strain so. 

And after that he would get very 
drunk and shout insults through the 
intercom system at Ernest Lytte. 
Usually, that is. 

Tonight, however, he bypassed 
the alcohol and the intercom. In- 
stead he went directly to Lytte’s 
cabin. With the intercom system 
linking Balt Donner to them there 
was nothing secret about their con- 
versation. 

“Think I’ve cracked this third sex 
setup here on Hald,” he boomed. 
Donner could imagine the dark

•cowl of bony Ernest Lytte it this 
interruption. 

“Record it,” Lytle’s reedy voice 
crackled back. 

“So you can bypass it for your 
stinking beetle carcasses and edible 
grasses.” Carney’s heavy voice was 

insulting. “Not much! You’re listen- 
ing ” 

mg. 

“Correction,” Lytte said, his voice 
sharpening. “This para says you’re 
leaving.” 

Donner heard a scuffle of move- 
ment, a chuffing soft sound — the 
blast of paralysis rays in the cramp- 
ed confines — and then the meaty 
impact of a clenched fist or a gun 
butt on flesh. He pushed back from 
the bench, his slim sensitive fingers 
twitching nervously. 

“There,” Carney’s voice was 
breathless. “You’re slow, Lytte. Not 
enough exercise. And drugs don’t 
help.” 

“I’ll kill you,” promised Lytte, his 
voice low and deadly. 

“As I was saying, Lytte, it’s about 
this Follower setup. The old natives 
I’ve contacted have no Followers. 
And they’re old. But in the villages 
all the humanoids and Followers are 
young.” 

“Make a recording, Carney,” said 
Lytte tonelessly. 

“You old space-wracked — ” Car- 
ney’s harsh laugh crashed out short- 
ly. “I’m hot recording this. But after 
dark I’m checking up on what I 
suspect.” 

“I refuse to listen.” 

“Refuse. But you’ll listen. Remem- 
ber those cells I discovered along 
the swamp edge? Like oversized 
cocoons.” 



Carney must have slammed Ms 
fist down on a desk for emphasis at 
this point. 

“I’m examining them tonight. This 
whole setup is crazy. I don’t believe 
the humaniods and the Followers 
are of common ancestry. A third sex 
or neuters doesn’t explain it,” Car- 
ney said. 

“You can’t do It, Carney!” ex- 
ploded Lytte. “We pledged ourselves 
not to meddle with the political or 
religious beliefs of the planets we 
map. Nor to kill or enslave any 
reasoning entity.” 

“That’s why I’m waiting for night. 
The natives won’t be about. And 
when I have my proof ve can blast 
off for the dayside again.” 

“It’s dangerous, Carney. I warn 
you not to risk it.” 

“I know. Clean hands for Ernest 
Lytte. And Rabbitnose Donner lis- 
tening on the intercom to back you 
up. But you know you’re as curious 
as I am.” 

“Curious, yes, but there are rules.” 

“Rules!” Carney roared angrily. 
“I’ll ready the equipment and have 
Donner check over Hercules.” 

Donner heard the big man’s feet 
on the deck. 

“Hear that, Donner?” the voice 
roared from the intercom. 

“Yes sir,” agreed the little man 
almost inaudibly. “I’ll check the 
super mech at once.” 

“And stand by to follow with that 
girl-faced Casanova mech in case I 
am in trouble.” 

“Very good, sir,” agreed Balt Don- 
ner. 

He started assembling the gauges 
and tools he would need.

IP 




T hree hours later he was once 
again lying on the sleeping 
(date beside the plastic dome shield- 
ing the mentrols, and the hood was 
damped lightly down upon his 
corded neck and chest. Here he 
could keep in communication with 
Jeff Carney, but he could also be 
following the huge super-mech, 
Herk, with its fellow robot, Cass. 

Lytte was sulking in his cabin, his 
eyes glassy and his senses blanked 
by an overdose of the drugs so 
essential in star hopping. For fifteen, 
perhaps twenty, hours he would be 
little better than a witless cretin. 

“Have reached a nest of the co- 
coons, or cells,” came Carney’s voice 
over the intercom. “They’re located 
in a group of water-rooted trees, 
almost an islet. Twelve of them.” 
Cass came alive in his clamps as 
Balt Donner pressed the mentrol’s 
activating stud. He passed out 
through the triple locks. About his 
tapering slim waist were belted twin 
paralysis pistols, and over his shoul- 
der projected the short snout of a 
heavy paralysis rifle. 

The super-mech crossed the tree- 
less clearing, the dew- wet sward 
softening his footfalls. He could see 
well, his eyes adjusted to the invisi- 
ble radiations from his chest torch. 

An erect running shape blundered 
toward him. He recognized the slim 
alien features. Alno! She ran unsee- 
ing into his arms. In time Donner 
remembered to shut off his throat 
mike as she cried out. 

“It’s Cass,” he said. “But where do 
you go in the darkness?” 

“It has come!” she cried. “A 
Follower has summoned me. Great 



Arm is dead, A ad I am to go to the 

village.” 

“I am glad for you, Alno.” 
“Then you do not wish me to 
remain Outcast — like you?” 

Her voice was wistful, and yet 
unsteady. He could sense that her 
loyalty to her people battled the 
strange attraction she felt for him. 
And he was relieved to know she 
would obey hit desires. 

“We are of different villages. Of 
different worlds. Go back to your 
village.” 

“As you wish, Cass.” Her voice 
was throaty. “But once more, please, 
the tasting of lips.” 

Cass grimaced into the darkness. 
Odd how soon the infatuation he 
had cultivated earlier had vanished. 
She was warm and pleasant m his 
arms, but any desire for her had 
gone. 

With a smoothness and practiced 
skill, result of hours spent watching 
teleview recordings, he drew her 
close and let her taste his moist 
synthalips. He was the very epitome 
of a polished, and bored, Casanova 
— not the mousy little Balt Donner 
of Earth. 

Carney’s heavy voice burned inte 
his ears as the girl slipped, softly 
sobbing, away into the darkness. 
And Donner flicked on the mike. 
“You there, Donner?” 

“Yes sir.” 

“Thought you were sleeping.” 

“Not a chance, sir.” 

“Found what I was after. Opened 
two of the pupae cases. They'ie 
partially developed Swimmers jut 
as I expected. Explains the lack of 
middle-aged and old natives.” 



THE FOLLOWERS 




“Something like the insects of 
earth,” hazarded Donner. 

“In a way.” 

“All these humanoids turning into 
amphibious monsters.” 

C arney chuckled. “In a way 
you’re right. But it’s not that 
simple. You forget the Followers.” 
“That’s right. What about them? 
Where do they go?” 

“They’re in the chrysalis. In fact 
they construct it. And they choose 
the time for this final metamorpho- 
sis.” 

“But just how — ?” 

“Can’t tell you more at the mo- 
ment, Donner. See a couple of 
Swimmers offshore and I want to 
take a few pictures.” 

Cass started down the hill again. 
And now he carried the rifle cradled 
in his arms. He had feared that the 
cocoons would be guarded, though 
he had hardly suspected the Swim- 
mers of being interested. 

“Donner! Get that super-mech 
down here at once!” Carney’s voice 
was strained and strangely muffled. 

“Paralyzed the two Swimmers. 
Then a few dozen more landed on 
my back. They broke my para with 
their flippers. Now they’re working 
at . 

“Hurry, Donner! My lord, there 
goes a leg! Something shorted. The 
other leg’s gone dead too. They’re 
twisting off my arms. Ripping out 
my equipment!” 

The Donner part of Cass groaned. 
Precious irreplaceable parts! And 
this was the third of the four super- 
mechs to be damaged or lost since 
leaving Earth. The first super-mech 



they had left in a slimepit on that 
giant yellow planet — its salvage 
impossible because of the crushing 
gravity. And on Xel IV’s lone planet, 
ice-bound and lifeless, a crevasse 
had swallowed up the second men- 
trol-controlled mech. 

Cass came bursting through the 
trees, out toward the isolated clump 
of trees now swarming with glis- 
tening-hided amphibious life. There 
was no sign of Herk in that fluid 
mass. 

He leveled the paralysis rifle, 
sweeping it in a broad arc that was 
half a circle. The Swimmers slid, 
quivering and twitching, away from 
the stilt-rooted bases of the trees, 
and Cass could see the shattered 
metal and gleaming plastics and 
quartz of what had but now been 
a smoothly functioning super mech. 

Cass groaned as he hastily gather- 
ed up the fragments of battered 
equipment. Even the robot’s head 
was torn away and this he tucked 
under his left arm. Then, using the 
half-crushed torso as a container, he 
salvaged all the visible parts. 

Back through the trees he raced. 
Back to the Avalon and its triple 
locks. And once inside he activated 
the meteor screen. There would be 
no blundering of Swimmers upon 
the spacer this night. 

H e went down the corridor to 
his workshop, carrying the 
battered torso of Herk. And there a 
haggard-eyed giant, his pink-whisk- 
ered cheeks oddly gray, was waiting. 
He wrenched at the powerful arm 
of Cass. 

“It isn’t ruined, is it?” 



108 



IF 




Cass shook his head. “Hopeless,” 
he rumbled. 

Carney’s eyes were wild. “But 
with only one super-mech!” 

“I know. If this last super-mech 
goes bad, we’re through.” 

“We must blast back to Earth. 
Now! At once!” 

“Without completing the swing?” 
Cass asked. “There yet remain seven 
possible planets to explore and map.” 

“Our present information is suf- 
ficient,” bellowed Carney, sudden 
rage restoring his color and vitality. 

“As you wish — sir,” said Cass, 
withdrawing from the shop. Gently 
he put down what remained of 
Herk. 

“I’m blasting off at once, Donner. 
Clamp your boob-faced dummy in 
his cell and join me in the control 
room.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“About these Followers, Donner. 
You didn’t get the right of it. The 
cocoons are for themselves. The 
humanoids sealed inside with them 
are for nourishment during the 
change!” 

Carney’s laughter brayed after 
him. And as he strode blindly toward 
the super-mech storage compart- 
ment his mind was reluctantly ac- 
cepting the truth. For the Swim- 
mers were octopods, even as were 
the Followers. 

Carefully the People were bred 
and cared for — even as are the 



c tie and sheep of Earth. Back 
Follower was assigned to look after 
and follow his own future food 
supply. Undoubtedly, too, most of 
the thankless and heavy tasks were 
performed by this willing slave he 
controlled. 

Then, when the time was ripe for 
the change, and when the humanoids 
had reproduced their kind and were 
grown sleek and fat, the grotesque 
“twins” paralyzed their charges and 
spun the cocoons. The metamorphis 
slowly came about, and eventually 
the Swimmers split apart the out- 
worn cells and escaped. Leaving 
behind — 

Balt Donner gagged. He waj 
seeing Alno, happy to be once again 
given a twin, and then he was seeing 
her empty husk, drained of all edible 
tissues and fluids, within the broken 
shell of the chrysalis. The feet of 
the super-mech stumbled uncertain- 
ly across the cabin. His mental 
commands were confused. 

Viciously he drove Cass back into 
the clips retaining his half-ton body. 
He locked it there, and then broke 
contact. He pushed up the mentrol 
hood, his scuff-clad feet reaching 
for the deck. 

Earth was far away and the yean 
were long. He was sick to death of 
alien cultures and savage worlds. 
Only in the depths of space might 
he find a measure of forgetfulness.

HO FRIEND OF GREF 

by C. C MocAPP 



Illustrated by NODEL 



The planet was an enemy 
at Mankind — all of it I 



I 

I t was not clear to Steve Duke 
what a Gree ship-of-the-line was 
doing in this unimportant little eddy 
of the galactic rim, all alone except 
for a single exploration ship one- 
tenth her size. Of course, she might 
be the bait in a trap; therefore, 
though she was a prize well worth 
the risking of his Scout squadron, 
he stayed hidden for the moment, 
as close as comfort allowed to the 
big red star of the binary, keeping 
watch via a series of tiny instrument 
drones. 

The exploration ship had evident- 



ly visited the single planet of the 
binary system, a world of moder- 
ately Terrestrial type except for being 
too close to the red star’s smaller 
blue- white companion. Steve had al- 
ready noted that there were no radio 
emanations from the planet, or other 
hints of technology — indeed, it was 
a planet where one would not look 
for any life. Why, then, had the 
huge fighting ship been summoned? 

He watched. Shortly after the ex- 
ploration ship finished matching 
courses, the big ship fired a salvo 
of missiles in the general direction 
of the blue-white star. Steve could 
not tell, from the picture his drones 



no 



brought back, what kind of missiles 
Aey were. It was obvious, though, 
tfiat it was not battle-salvo, because 
there was no swarm of smaller com- 
puter-guided missiles along to fight 
off a counter-salvo. Neither could 
it do anything to the blue sun except 
raise an insignificant short-lived 
flare. Therefore, it must be aimed 
at the planet. He considered nulling 
a larger drone close, but decided it 
was too risky. 

Yet, if Gree explored a planet 
then hastily bombed it — probably 
with cobalt bombs, or something 
equally deadly — Steve wanted to 
know what was there. Suddenly de- 
ciding, he jabbed at a button on his 
console and said into his helmet 
mike. “All ships except number 
Two. I’m locking you into central 
control. Battle Condition One. Null 
m thirty seconds. Two, stay here 
and collect the rest of the drones, 
Ihen compile a report to date and 
null it to Headquarters. If you lose 
contact with us, leave at once. Oth- 
erwise, we’ll send message drones 
once an hour. Out” 

H e nulled the eleven ships in a 
group and spaced in ahead of 
flie Gree salvo, far enough from the 
Mg ship to avoid direct detection 
and far enough from the salvo to 
avoid instrument drones that would 
be with it Then he got on the 
command circuit again. “We’re 
foing to have a busy twenty hours 
or so, in a little while. When those 
missiles orbit the planet, we’re going 
to shunt them off one by one — on 
fee other side of the planet, where 
ft won’t be seen — and substitute 



simple warheads of our own, so 
Greell think the planet’s sterilized. 
We’ll have to locate any watch- 
drones and neutralize them tempor- 
arily. We can’t be seen, and we 
can’t let a single Gree bomb hit the 
planet Better get all your comput- 
ers cleared of everything else; they’ll 
be busy. Gunnery Officers, get your 
own material ready. Gunnery One, 
I want a co-ordinated tentative plan 
right away and a team to keep re- 
vising it as we get more data. Any 
questions?” 

There were only a few technical 
questions. Then the CO of Scout 
Three dared the question that was 
in everyone’s mind. “What are we 
going to do when we finish with the 
bombs, Colonel?” 

“When — and if — we finish with 
them, I’ll take a small team down 
and see what’s got Gree so scared.” 

There were times during the op- 
eration when Steve thought he was 
failing, and once he was mere sec- 
onds from death; but eventually all 
the deadly bombs were shunted 
away from the planet, and detona- 
tions of his own produced convinc- 
ing clouds in the atmosphere. He 
sent the squadron, except for his 
flagship, into null; in case the Gree 
leviathan hadn’t been fooled after 
all. As soon as he could, he’d have 
himself set down on the planet and 
send the flagship away too — the 
sooner the better — but before that 
he had to scout briefly from space. 

The planet had a diameter close 
to twelve thousand miles and a 
density, compared to water, of a 
little over three point nine, which 
meant a comfortable surface grav- 



MO FRIEND OF GREE

ity. With such a total mass and con- 
sidering the amount of dispersed gas 
(especially hydrogen and helium) in 
the neighborhood of the binary, 
there might have been a very dense 
atmosphere, but it only computed to 
a little over twenty pounds per 
square inch at the surface. It didn’t 
take long to realize why. This plan- 
et kept one face always turned to 
the blue-white sun. The temperature 
at meridian on that side was some- 
thing over two-hundred degrees Cen- 
tigrade, which meant that a lot of 
air molecules must reach escape 
velocity. As a matter of fact, he 
realized, if it hadn’t been for the 
huge red companion star, there 
wouldn’t be any atmosphere at all, 
to speak of. What didn’t boil away 
on the hot side would be frozen 
on the dark side. As it was, the 
latter hemisphere would only be 
dark, and space-cold or nearly so, 
for part of the year, when the orbit 
around the blue star faced it away 
from the red one. At the moment 
about a third of the off side was lit 
with a mild reddish light, and ob- 
viously was warm since unfrozen 
seas and lakes could be seen. It was 
a beautiful world, seen from space. 
An impossible one, though, for car- 
bon-based life. 

Or was it? There seemed to be a 
band, the twilight of the blue star’s 
fierce glare, that was neither baked 
nor frozen — even where the red 
star’s gentle illumination did not 
fall. Steve frowned at the viewscreen. 
It wasn’t only that the blue sun’s 
rays went in slantingly through the 
deep atmosphere, but a narrow, very 
high wall of clouds along the bright 



edge of the twilight zone cast long 
semi-shadows, ending in an actual 
rainbow upon the ground. The 
whole band was five hundred or a 
thousand miles wide, depending upon 
where one set the arbitrary limits. 
It seemed to him that there was 
more green in it than there should 
be. He called his Med Officer, the 
nearest thing he had to a biologist. 
“Did we read for chlorophyll?” 

“Why, no sir. I thought it was 
obvious that — ” 

“So did I; but I think we’d better 
check.” 

However, even before the spectro- 
grams confirmed it, Steve was sure. 
The twilight band was vegetated. 

II 

H e decided to take with him only 
two B’lant crewmen; a mature 
one named Vrebl, who’d been with 
him on several missions, and a young 
one named Zaanj who had the stan- 
dard training, if no experience. The 
ship deposited the three of them on 
a large rock in a field of grass that 
grew higher than a man’s head, just 
over a ridge from where the Gree 
team had camped. 

The chill air had a faint musky 
smell. No large animals had 
been seen from the ship, but 
here and there the grass waved 
with hidden movements. On a saber- 
like grassblade ten feet away and 
only a little below eye level, an insect 
the size of Steve’s thumb perched on 
six fat legs, and, he was sure, stared 
back at him out of bulging faceted 
eyes. It looked like a giant bumble- 
bee that had lost its wings. Then, 



112 



ir 




suddenly, the fat legs exploded with 
hairs or tiny feathers and became 
wings which blurred into motion. 
The thing droned away, very slowly 
and in a straight line, like a mechan- 
ical toy on a stretched wire. Here 
and there above the grass, other such 
bugs floated in the same way. 

Several hundred yards away some- 
thing flapped along on slow rigid 
wings, like a monstrous moth. It 
must have had a six-foot wing- 
spread. It seemed to be catching the 
two-inch bugs and eating them on 
the fly. 

Along one horizon — technically 
it had to be called the west, but 
only because of their position rela- 
tive to the planet’s north pole — was 
the wall of cloud that hid the blue 
sun; murky at the horizon, luminous 
farther up, with a bright fringe at 
the top that hinted at a spectrum. 
That one brightness only accentuat- 
ed the gray bloom that surrounded 
Steve and the two B’lant. Above the 
bright fringe the sky was dirty blue. 
As the eye arched overhead, the 
blue became darker until, in the 
‘east’ where no sun would ever rise, 
it was black and the stars stood out. 
Northward and a little east, a faint 
reddish glow above the ridge re- 
vealed the direction of the red sun. 

Steve told his two companions, 
“We’ll have a look at the Gree 
campsite first, then we’ll head north. 
There are some mountains there, and 
their other slopes will be lit by the 
red sun. We ought to be more com- 
fortable there. A ways beyond is 
the ocean, where we’ll wait for the 
ship. It’ll be back in five hundred 
hours unless we call it back sooner.” 



H e began allocating supplies and 
equipment to be carried. Some 
of the more vital things, such as the 
small message drones that were the 
only way to contact the squadron, 
he assigned to Zaanj, who because 
of his inexperience would walk sec- 
ond. Steve would lead the way, even 
though he’d chosen B’lant partly be- 
cause their thick gray skins would 
withstand the swordlike grass better 
than any other ‘humanoids’. It would 
be up to Vrebl to keep a watch to 
the rear. 

It was depressing in the grass, 
totally cut off from everything but 
the dismal sky overhead. Steve push- 
ed on grimly, forcing a way by 
holding his rifle at a slant ahead 
of him, and was very glad when 
they crossed the top of the ridge 
and found themselves in the open. 

The wide shallow ravine below 
them was in even deeper gloom. 
This slope, and the opposite one, 
were rocky, with only scattered 
patches of grass. At the bottom a 
small creek found a crooked way 
among flat slabs that looked like 
weathered lava flows. He helped 
Vrebl and Zaanj set up electronic 
sentries, then unslung his field 
glasses. 

The campsite, on a level spot be- 
yond the creek, was marked by a 
triangle of fire-blackened stones and 
some empty food containers. That 
the Gree team had left without po- 
licing up attested to its haste. He 
couldn’t tell, in the uncertain light, 
where the ship had parked. 

They broke out field rations, ate, 
and made themselves as comfort- 
able as possible. Nothing moved in 



NO FRIEND OF GREE 



113 




the ravine for a couple of hours. 
Then there was a stir in a dump of 
grass halfway up the opposite slope. 
Steve focussed on the spot. Some- 
thing dark and bulky moved into 
the open and came down the incline, 
slowly and haltingly. Once it went 
flat for three or four minutes, then 
heaved itself up and continued. He 
couldn’t make out its exact shape, 
but it seemed to move on four 
stumpy legs. One of the giant moths 
came gliding over the ridge, circled 
the thing a few times, and flapped 
away, without any sign of reaction 
from the beast. 

The thing reached the campsite 
and nosed around very deliberately 
among the fire stones and empty 
containers. Presently it moved down- 
stream and seemed to be digging at 
the edge of a small patch of grass. 

S teve abruptly stowed the glasses, 
got to his feet and told Vrebl, 
“Stay here and watch. Get on the 
radio if anything tries to sneak up 
on us.” To Zaanj he said, “Come 
with me. Well cover each other. I 
want a close look, then I want to 
anesthetize the thing without killing 
it, if possible.” 

He scuttled alone to the nearest 
clump of grass, scouted it quickly 
then motioned Zaanj to him. They 
worked their way in such relays to 
the stream below the animal, waded 
across, and approached the clump of 
grass carefully. Steve set his rifle 
for the anesthetic darts, made sure 
Zaanj did likewise, then motioned 
the young B’lant around the other 
side of the clump. 

When Steve got where he could 



see the animal, he stopped, with a 
feeling almost of nausea. 

It was turned partly away from 
him, scraping slowly and awkwardly 
at the ground with one stubby fore- 
paw. He should have been able to 
see its head from this angle, but 
couldn’t. The hind legs were stumpy 
too, with bulbous clumsy feet. But 
it was the thing’s pelt, if it could 
be called one, that revolted Steve. 
It looked like a huge and obscenely 
filthy and moth-eaten fur coat. Dried 
grass clung to it as if the creature 
had wallowed in glue then rolled 
in a haystack. There were also pack- 
ed masses of the large bugs, dead 
and dismembered, and scraps of 
what looked like rotten leather. 

The thing stopped pawing and 
stood, flanks aheave with its loud 
rasping breath. Then, as if under 
mindless compulsion, it resumed the 
slow pawing. 

Zaanj stepped into sight beyond 
the creature, froze, and let out a 
shocked sound. The thing reared 
up, clumsily, whirled toward Steve, 
saw him too, and lurched away from 
both of them. It struggled to its 
hind legs, staggered, caught its bal- 
ance. It ran up the slope, awkward- 
ly but with fair speed. Its stride was 
almost humanoid, or like a human- 
oid hobbled. Now Steve saw there 
was a head, or at least a formless 
bulge between hulking shoulders. 
He could hear its hoarse gasping. 
He put an anesthetic dart into it 
and saw it jerk; then, more for his 
own state of mind than because he 
thought it necessary, another. He 
glanced at Zaanj. The normally 
phlegmatic blunt face was twisted in 



114 



IP 




horror. Zaanj’s rifle hung forgotten 
in one hand. Steve found himself 
grinning. “Come on. It won’t get 
far.” 

H e was wrong. The thing labored 
badly near the top of the 
slope, but reached it and pushed into 
the grass. When they reached the 
spot Steve held up a hand for si- 
lence. He could hear the beast deep 
in the grass, panting, but still going 
on. There were other furtive rust- 
lings in the grass. 

He didn’t think he wanted to pur- 
sue. 

He led the way back down the 
slope, meanwhile calling Vrebl on 
the radio, “Gather up the stuff and 
come on over. Stay in the open 
where we can cover you.” 

By the time the older B’lant join- 
ed them, they were standing where 
the animal had dug, staring down. 
There was only a small area of 
plastic exposed, but Steve knew 
what they’d find, and he was right. 
It was a Gree slave, neither B’lant 
nor human, buried in his uniform 
and a limp plastic spacesuit. The 
face was horribly battered or eaten, 
and dark fragments clung to it, as 
if a coating of something like black 
wax or hard rubber had been scrap- 
ed off. Steve turned away. “Let’s 
find some rocks to pile over him, 
then we’d better get away from 
here.” 

He didn’t say so, but he had a 
strong hunch that before the hum- 
anoid in the grave had been cleaned 
off he’d looked like the creature 
they’d chased. 

He had an impulse to call a ship 



NO FRIEND OF GREE 




back at once. There was the risk of 
Gree ships lurking about, and he 
had confidence in himself and the 
two B’lant armed with rifles that 
could shoot, besides the darts, explo- 
sive bullets or laser beams. He 
decided not to call a ship. 

He’d seen from the air that the 
grassfield ended a few miles up- 
stream. He worried vaguely that 
they couldn’t get far before full 
darkness. Then he felt foolish and 
angry with himself. There wasn't 
any full darkness. He led them up 
the ravine, assigning Vrebl to watch 
behind. 

Ill 

F our hours took them ten miles 
upstream and perhaps three 
thousand feet higher. It was damper 
up here, and the rock tablelands 
were green and slippery with moss. 
The two-inch bugs were everywhere. 

Once Steve brought up suddenly 
and grunted a warning. Something 
the size of a large dog moved to- 
ward them. When it was closer he 
saw that it was a giant insect, with 
an ovoid body and six closely 
bunched stiltlike legs that moved in 
an odd mincing gait. A head the 
size of his two fists doubled togeth- 
er, with two great faceted eyes and 
several stubby antennae, swivelled 
from side • to side like a turret, 
mounted in the forward end of the 
body without a neck. At the other 
end was a three-foot whiplike tail 
that the thing carried over its back, 
like a scorpion’s sting. Steve was 
about to shoot when it saw them 
and stopped. The mincing stride re- 



versed and it backed away without 
turning, then stopped and was mo- 
tionless for several minutes. Finally 
it turned with little prancing steps 
and moved to the side. Suddenly 
the legs flashed into motion and 
two of them thrust out forward to 
seize one of the two-inch bugs and 
haul it, feathery legs droning, to a 
pair of small mandibles on the 
head. Zaanj let out his breath and 
raised his rifle. Steve put out a 
restraining hand. “Never fire an un- 
necessary shot on a strange world.” 

They found a flat area big enough 
so nothing could creep up on them, 
and made camp. From here they 
could see the unimpressive moun- 
tains to the north, with the reddish 
glow above them. 

Steve was by no means through 
with the Gree campsite, but it would 
be imprudent to stay near it just 
now. Later, if things went well, he’d 
come back with a larger, better 
equipped team. Right now he want- 
ed to get out of this clammy twilight 
and to the other side of the moun- 
tains. 

Vrebl evidently followed his gaze 
and guessed his thoughts. “I hope 
there is game. Zis zings we see so 
far is not tempting.” 

“No,” Steve agreed. He suppress- 
ed a grin. It was a standing joke, if 
not strictly true, that a B’lant would 
eat anything. He idly watched one 
of the stilt-legged giant insects 
munch on a bug, warning away with 
its tail a monster moth that flapped 
around it. “At least,” he said, “we’ll 
take time now to heat some water 
and dump some soup powder into 
it” 



116 



IF 




T hey traveled north, staying well 
above the grasslands, for fifty 
hours, with short stops. Then, within 
a few miles of the mountains, they 
found the way barred by a great 
rift. It looked about two miles wide 
and a thousand feet deep. 

No doubt it was some ancient 
rupture of the crust and related to 
the mountains, but it was filled in 
now with a level floor, and the 
grass had spread into it solidly ex- 
cept for the steep sides and the 
taluses at their bottoms. It looked as 
if it might reach a long way in 
either direction, so if they wanted 
to get to the mountains, they’d have 
to cross it. Once more, Steve found 
himself thinking in terms of day 
and night. Annoyed, he jerked out 
the binoculars. 

The way the grass rippled showed 
that a river of air moved along the 
rift, from the direction of the grass- 
lands toward the cloud band on his 
left. He puzzled that out. The floor 
of the rift must slope slightly to- 
ward the left, even against the gen- 
eral rise of the land; and the air in 
the rift must be denser — possibly 
because of some distilling action of 
this planet’s peculiar seasons. 

There were giant moths down 
there, and stirrings in the grass that 
were not made by the moving air. 
He decided to climb down, then 
reconnoiter before pushing into the 
grass. He spied out a clear spot at 
the edge, and a way down to it. 
“Let’s go.” 

The air was dried and warmer at 
the bottom, and heady, and instru- 
ments showed a higher percentage 
of oxygen. The insect life was pro- 



fuse. He set up sound amplifiers 
and listened to the rustles in the 
grass. They seemed to move in ran- 
dom directions. He looked at the 
B’lant to see what shape they were 
in, and said, “Let’s get an hour’s 
nap apiece, one at a time.” 

When they’d had that, and there 
was still no sign of trouble, he said, 
“Well, we’d better get it. over with. 
Set the guns on laser. If anything 
actually attacks, burn it down quick 
then cut a circle around us in case 
there are more.” 

Vrebl said, “Should I not go first? 
My skin — ” 

Steve shook his head. The B’lant 
were very reliable, once they’d learn- 
ed something, but human reflexes 
were a little faster; and besides . 
He led off. He’d already learned, 
during the earlier trip in the grass, 
that the thing to do was to use his 
feet to bend stalks forward ahead of 
him, more or less breaking the way. 
Still, it was tedious going. 

H e timed his first hundred steps. 

At this rate, it would take 
them about an hour and a half to 
cross, which wasn’t a pleasant pros- 
pect. The feeling of oppression re- 
turned. 

In about ten minutes he ran into 
a matted wall of grass that didn’t 
yield. He muttered an oath as a 
blade slide along the back of his 
hand, giving him about the twentieth 
cut. He tried to go around the ob- 
struction, thinking it was just a 
thick clump, and found it was ac- 
tually a straight long barrier, stretch- 
ing longitudinally in the rift. He 
stood perfectly still for a few mo- 
lly 



NO FRIEND OF GREE 




ments, listening. There were no un- 
usual sounds. He fished in his 
pockets for a small light and ex- 
amined the barrier. The stalks were 
aot just matted; they were inter- 
woven in a way that was surely 
artificial. He glanced at Vrcbl and 
Zaanj to see if they realized it too. 
They did. He said softly, “Let’s get 
ourselves a little breathing room.” 
He held the rifle low and triggered 
it, swung it in an arc, carefully 
avoiding the fence. Grass toppled 
upon him. The B’lant got the idea 
and helped him complete the arc 
and trample the cut stalks, until 
they had a clear half circle of about 
twenty-foot radius. It felt good. 

Carefully, he parted the thin 
stand of grass he’d left along the 
harrier and studied the latter more 
closely. The stalks were not only 
interwoven; where they crossed, lit- 
tle bridges had grown between them 
to hold them in place. The barrier 
was eight or ten stalks thick. No 
wonder it didn’t yield easily. It 
would be simple to burn through it, 
•r even hack a way with a knife, but 
he wasn’t going to do either hastily. 
That might be what the Gree ex- 
plorers had done. 

On the other hand, they might 
have followed along a similar 
fence to their doom. 

Could there be such a thing as 
sentient grass? If so, he’d just 
slaughtered some thousands of in- 
dividuals. If they were individuals. 
But there’d been no sign of resistance 
or awareness. He bent and tugged 
at a stump until it came up. It had 
so ordinary, discrete root system, 
and when he sliced off the burnt 



end it oozed a light colorless liquid, 

as any grass might. 

H e turned back to the fence. He 
noticed now that the tiny 
bridges joining the Interwoven stalks 
were withered and dry, though the 
stalks were green. He found a few 
of the bridges ruptured, letting the 
stalks break away and in a few cases 
untangle themselves. He used a mag- 
nifying glass to examine the stalks, 
and the blades, for any sign of spe- 
cial organs. It was just big grass. 

He said, “Let’s follow along this 
a ways to see if it ends or turns. 
At least, it protects us on one side." 

It wasn’t until they’d gone a 
hundred yards or so that he realized 
he’d instinctively turned left, away 
from the grassfields. 

A half hour brought no change 
in the fence. He called a halt and 
turned on the sound amplifier to 
make sure there were no unusual 
rustlings around them. Then he gave 
his companions a look to alert them, 
triggered his rifle and cut a door- 
way through the fence. On the other 
side, he led on for about twenty 
yards, then stopped to listen again. 

In the next hour they found over 
a dozen of the fences. Some were 
very fresh — that is, the bridges 
were not withered — and some were 
so old they’d almost completely 
vanished. Sometimes dead stalks 
were held upright, still tangled with 
live ones, while new ones pushed 
up through the tangle. After the 
first two, Steve cut through them 
without hesitation. He was more in- 
terested in getting across the rift 
fast than in staying to ponder. 




They must have been three- 
fourths of the way across when he 
•ensed some change in the pattern 
of sounds. He crouched, listening. 
Something was approaching from 
ahead. He snapped, “Burn a clear- 
ing!” and slashed right and left 
with his own rifle. There was a 
grating sound somewhere close, 
and a thrashing. Grass collapsed 
upon him. He threw it off, did a 
hasty dance to get it trampled down. 
The B’lant were struggling similar- 
ly, Zaanj almost with hysteria, 
which was unusual for his race. 
Steve got clear of the last stalks 
and gestured toward the center of 
the clearing. “Back to back!” 

The rustlings had stopped, and 
the silence was worse. At the edge 
of their clearing, something bulky 
stirred feebly beneath fallen grass. 
Steve took four steps forward and 
poked the grass aside with his rifle. 
One of the stilt-legged things lay 
there, mortally burned. Its scorched 
stench mingled with the punky smell 
of burnt grass. 

Then he saw that the thing was 
swaddled in grass the rifles had 
never cut. Dried stalks were woven 
around its body and around each 
of the six legs, and a thick twisted 
grass rope circled like a collar 
where its neck should have been. 
The head was encased in a crude 
woven basket that left only patches 
of the huge eyes exposed. The 
stinger-tail was free, moving feebly. 

Steve ended its misery and re- 
treated to his companions. They 
waited. The various rustlings re- 
sumed, then the thing he’d heard in 
front came on again. It mumbled 



now, almost m human speech. 
Zaanj whirled toward the sound, 
and Steve snapped at him, “Hold 
your fire!” 

IV 

A horrible caricature of a man 
pushed the grass aside and 
stood looking at them vaguely with 
dull bloodshot eyes. Steve couldn’t 
tell what race he was because he 
was encased in woven grass much as 
the insect was, except that his head 
was buried in a mound of dead 
two-inch bugs. The eyes peered out 
through small tunnels. 

One of the arms lifted in an in- 
human gesture, fell again. A black 
gap of a mouth split open in the 
horrible mass and an incompre- 
hensive mumble came out. Steve 
fought down the urge to trigger his 
rifle, and demanded in English, 
which all Gree slaves spoke more 
or less, “Can you understand me?” 
The creature obviously r half un- 
derstood. More mumbling emerged 
from its mouth. Then, one word 
came clear. “Gr — Gree?” 

Steve hesitated. To say anything 
against Gree to a Gree slave was 
like talking to the wind, but this 
thing, perhaps, no longer had the 
mind of a Gree slave. Steve said 
slowly and distinctly, “Gree aban- 
doned you. Gree wants to kill this 
planet. We stopped him. Do you 
understand?” 

The eyes strayed blankly, struggled 
back to Steve. Then they dropped 
to the rifle. “Kill?” the creature 
said absently. 

Steve dropped the muzzle toward 

tlf 



NO FRIEND OF GREE 




the ground. “No,” he said, point- 
ing to himself, “I won’t kill you. I 
won’t hurt you. Gree tried to kill 
vou.” 

From the wavering of the eyes, 
it was clear the thing was strug- 
gling with the thought. There was 
none of the instinctive disbelief a 
Gree slave ought to show. Finally 
the eyes came back to Steve’s face. 
“Gree . kill.” Suddenly, the en- 
crusted head began to nod laborious- 
ly. “Yes. Gree kill. You . not 
Gree . .” An exhausted sigh, and 
the eyes went dull again. 

Steve waited a moment, but there 
were only vague mutters and small 
meaningless motions. He said, “Are 
you hungry?” 

That brought a flicker of intelli- 
gence. “Hu-hungry?” A hand came 
up, unsteadily. The fingers plucked 
slowly, absently, at a dead insect 
and crammed it into the mouth. 
The mouth chewed slowly, mech- 
anically. There was a movement of 
swallowing, then an idiot laugh. 
The eyes were vague again. 

Steve said, “We won’t hurt you. 
We will help you.” 

Intelligence fought back into the 
bloodshot eyes, as if from another 
universe. They squeezed shut with 
the effort of speech. “You . not 
enemy ...” The thing took an aim- 
less step forward. 

Z aanj mouthed an hysterical 

sound and swept his rifle up. 
Steve batted at it, and the beam 
sizzled into the ground at the crea- 
ture’s feet. The creature leaped and 
lunged sideways into the grass, 
scrabbling to escape. Zaanj let go 



of the rifle and, mewling mindless- 
ly, whirled to plunge into the grass 
on the opposite side. Steve shouted 
after him. Vrebl spun to follow, and 
Steve seized his arm. “Don ’t get 
separated from me!” As they raced 
after Zaanj, Steve tossed a look be- 
hind and saw that the creature had 
vanished. 

They shouted for Zaanj, and call- 
ed on the radio, and, when they 
knew they’d lost him, stood still 
and used the sound prck-ups. There 
were rustlings, many of them, and 
all seemed to be down the rift now 
and moving away, fast. They fought 
in that direction for a while until 
they had to admit they were hope- 
lessly outdistanced. Vrebel stopped 
and turned, facing Steve silently. 
Steve said, “We won’t find him this 
way. Let’s get clear. If he’s all right 
he’ll come to his senses eventually, 
and use his radio.” He headed back 
toward the clearing, as well as he 
could judge. “We’ve got to pick up 
his rifle.” 

They found the clearing without 
much trouble. The rifle and the 
dead stilt-insect were still there. 
Steve picked up the rifle and, re- 
luctantly, nodded to Vrebl to break 
trail. 

When they got clear Steve chose 
a spot part way up the side of the 
rift and they climbed as fast as 
they could. He stood a minute, 
fighting for breath, then, his hands 
clumsy with exhaustion, uncased 
the binoculars. He located an area 
of ripples, a mile or more down the 
rift, as if a small army were fleeing 
through the grass. 

He tried the radio again, without 

IF 



120 




response. He swept the glasses 
around once more, then slowly put 
them away. “I think,” he said, 
“we’ll have to assume he’s been 
captured. God knows by what. But 
it looks as if they’re going down the 
rift. I think we’d better climb up 
and go along the rim; it’ll be fast- 
er.” As Vrebl looked reluctant, he 
added, “If he uses the radio, we’ll 
still hear him.” 

I t took over two hours to catch 
up with the army of ripples. 
They paralleled it, stopping when 
it stopped. Vrebl didn’t protest, 
though obviously he wasn’t sure 
they were doing the right thing. For 
that matter, Steve wasn’t sure eith- 
er; he was merely making the best 
gamble he could. However, after 
nearly seven hours, they had a bit 
of luck. 

There was an open pool of water 
near the far side, where a small 
creek came down; and, as they 
rested, Steve turned his glasses on 
the pool. There were small creatures 
of some sort at the edge of the wa- 
ter. Then he went tense. Two man- 
like figures waded into the water, 
which was only up to their calves, 
and slumped down into it, rolling 
and splashing and gulping great 
draughts like children on a hot day. 
One of them, Steve thought, was 
the afflicted Gree slave they’d talked 
to. The other, though woven grass 
partially covered him, might be 
Zaanj. He handed the binoculars to 
Vrebl. 

Vrebl looked a long time, then 
handed back the glasses. “Yes. It k 
Zaanj.” 



“Well,” Steve said, “we could try 
to rescue him. But it’s more impor- 
tant for us to stay alive and sane 
until rendezvous time. We may not 
get to the ocean, but the ship’ll 
make a pass this way and we’ll 
reach her by radio. And I want to 
know where that bunch is headed. 
There’s something significant about 
this rift.” 

Vrebl thought it over, slowly. 
“Yes,” he agreed finally, “zat is 
right. But is it not worz while to 
call ze ships early so we can rescue 
Zaanj?” 

Steve gave him an annoyed look. 
“I’m not all that cold-blooded. If 
you’ll remember, Zaanj was carry- 
ing all the message drones.” 

The land continued to slope up, 
and the floor of the rift continued 
to get lower. Steve left the edge 
when the going was faster away 
from it, returning every few miles to 
make sure the hidden army was still 
moving. The mountains loomed only 
a few miles to the north, so close 
the red sun’s glow was completely 
hidden. Ahead, the cloud band 
towered incredibly, and its dark 
base seemed very close. The driz- 
zles were heavier and more fre- 
quent here; the moss thicker. Still 
the movement in the rift went on. 
Steve was sometimes tempted to 
climb down, to get into the warmth 
and dryness again. He also kept 
thinking what it would be like to 
cross the mountains, feel the luxury 
of that red sun. It would be easy 
enough to rationalize that the right 
thing to do was to abandon Zaanj; 
keep the rendezvous with the ship. 
But — he admitted it to himself — 



NO FRIEND OF GREE 



121 




the thing that really kept him going 
was curiosity about the rift. 

Then the drizzles became con- 
stant, and they were entering the 
cloud band itself. Sometimes the 
floor of the rift was obscured, and 
he led Vreb) along as fast as their 
exhausted bodies would take them, 
to find a clear spot and lie watching 
until the mysterious army caught up. 
It was very hard to keep track of 
now, even when the mist was thin, 
because of the deep gloom here un- 
der the clouds. 

There was no change for perhaps 
twenty-five miles more, then the 
clouds — heavy mist now, that sur- 
rounded them except for a clear up- 
draft out of the rift — began to 
brighten. They couldn’t go much 
farther without breaking out into 
the deadly rays of the blue sun. 
Then, the next time he looked into 
the rift, he found that it had 
changed. 

V 

I nstead of a smooth grassfield, 
there was a tangled steaming 
writhing jungle, slashed by weed- 
choked lagoons. The coiling ten- 
tacles that were so startling at first 
were only giant plant tendrils grop- 
ing for holds on the tallest trees. 
Slug-like things — they must be a 
foot long,- or more — crawled on the 
tendrils. Huge segmented worms un- 
dulated like eels through the thick- 
grown water, or looped themselves 
along limbs or tendrils. The giant 
moths were everywhere. He noticed 
that they, and the worms, carefully 
avoided the sluglike things, though 



the latter had no apparent means of 
defense. A smell of rot and fermen- 
tation rose in the updraft. He said, 
“I think we’d better backtrack a 
ways.” 

It was only two miles or so back 
to where the swamp was invaded by 
long fingers of dry, grass-covered 
ground. Billows of mist showed how 
abrupt the transition actually was. 
He swept the binoculars up the rift 
There was movement in the grass, 
but he couldn’t tell whether the 
bunch they’d been following was 
here yet. He studied the slope be- 
low him. The talus was high here, 
well above the grass. “I think we’d 
better go part way down, so we can 
see better.” 

He chose a place that was high 
enough for a good angle of view, 
and far enough from the swamp so 
they couldn’t smell it. They made 
camp and broke out rations. 

As he kept watch on the grass, 
Steve grew discouraged. The breez- 
es were so broken here, and thers 
were so many random movements 
in the grass, as well as swarms of 
bugs, plus giant moths, that ho 
couldn’t be sure of anything. 

He tensed as he saw a dark rough- 
ly globular thing bobbing along 
the surface of the grass, a little way 
up the rift and near this side. When 
it got closer he could see that it was 
not something’s head, but a detach- 
ed mass, a foot or more through, 
supported and moved along by 
stalks of grass that bent and gather- 
ed themselves beneath it. It pro- 
gressed at what he judged to be lest 
than a mile an hour. Behind it. It 
left a visible trail which, he wee 



122 



17 




sure, would be one of the fences. 

He looked elsewhere. There were 
several such blobs in sight, all mov- 
ing toward the swamp. He turned 
his glasses back to the close one. 
The surface was definitely grainy; 
and without actually seeing so, he 
told Vrebl, “I’ll bet you half my 
soup powder that that’s a ball of 
dead bugs.” He handed over the 
glasses. 

Vrebl looked, then handed the 
glasses back. “Yes. I will not bet.” 

The weird progress continued, 
swerved out onto one of the grassy 
fingers of land. Near the end of 
it, there was a halt and a period 
when the grass moved obscurely be- 
low the object. Then the ball shot 
up suddenly as if from a catapult, 
arched out and over, and plopped 
into the swamp. Steve saw water 
splash. 

Vrebl said, “Do you zink some- 
zing is getting rid of garbage?” 

“No. I think something just de- 
posited an egg. It attracted the bugs 
somehow, maybe by forcing juice 
out of the grass, killed them and 
formed them into a ball, with its 
egg inside.” He put the glasses away 
and got slowly to his feet. “If some- 
thing takes eggs to the swamp, 
whatever hatches will go back to 
the grass; and that’s the time to see 
it. Let’s get down there.” 

O ne of the big slugs labored from 
the swamp, crawling where it 
could, wiggling painfully through 
the weed-choked water where it had 
to. It reached the finger of land 
where Steve and Vrebl were wait- 
ing, humped itself urgently to the 




NO FRIEND OF GREE 



123 



edge of the grass and squeezed it- 
self in among the stalks, where it 
slumped as if exhausted. 

After a while it stirred again. 
Pseudopods poked slowly from it 
and crawled up the nearer grass 
stalks. Others grew long and slim 
and felt about until each attached 
itself to a stalk. There must have 
been nearly a hundred, finally. The 
slug-body was shrunken and empty, 
and were already beginning to dry 
out. 

A trembling seized the stalks. 
They began to writhe like worms, 
near the bases at first, then higher 
until even the blades came alive. 
They interlaced themselves, those 
on the side away from the swamp 
searching farther, like blind snakes, 
thrusting themselves against new 
stalks, weaving in and out. Steve, 
heedless of danger, ran close and 
saw the controlled stalks grow tiny 
bridges to the new ones. The pro- 
cess grew faster and more confident, 
and he was reminded of a new-born 
colt finding its legs. Always, there 
were about a hundred stalks moving, 
but that hundred progressed away 
from the swamp, leaving behind 
the inert interwoven fence. Ten feet 
from the swamp, the live group was 
moving steadily at least two miles 
per hour. 

Steve thought of rushing into the 
grass ahead of the thing, burning a 
swath around it to isolate it and see 
what it would do. But that was an 
experiment that could wait for a 
subsequent landing. He tugged at 
the inert structure left behind. A 
few stalks pulled loose, but there 
was no reaction. 



This, then, was the thing that 
could not only live in grass, but 
could somehow take over animals. 
No wonder the humanoid they’d 
talked to didn’t have the mind of a 
Gree slave; and no wonder Zaanj 
had never used his radio. Steve re- 
membered the giant insect, clothed 
or shackled in grass. Did they just 
use animals as steeds, to move 
where grass didn’t grow? Or did 
they use them for special purposes 
such as fighting? 

Zaanj didn’t matter now. Even 
the message drones could be aban- 
doned. 

The thing to do was to get to 
safety; make sure he and Vrebl 
stayed free until the ship arrived. 
He looked at his chronometer. They 
had time to get to the summit of 
the mountains, at least, where they’d 
have line-of-sight contact with the 
rendezvous spot. The radios had 
plenty of range. 

But there might be peril in the 
mountains. Wasn’t it wiser to camp 
up on the edge of the rift, in an 
environment they’d already come 
to know? 

In any case, the first thing to do 
was to get out of the rift. He jerk- 
ed his head to Vrebl. 

They made camp on a high spot 
of the rim, near the edge, where 
they could keep watch on the rift 
as well as on the mossy tablelands. 
Steve looked longingly toward the 
mountains. In a few hours, perhaps, 
he’d decide to leave the rift. Mean- 
while, they needed rest. 

Then, a few hours later, he awoke 
from a nap to find that Vrebl had 
gone. 



124 



IF 




VI 

T he B’lant had left all three rifles 
and most of the rations, and all 
the instruments except his own ra- 
dio. Steve immediately called, and 
got no answer. 

He didn’t have to look for a 
trail to know where Vrebl had gone. 
He got out the glasses and trained 
them on the grass below him. A 
quarter-mile out, the grasses stirred 
in a steady way that a walking man 
might produce. He laid a tentative 
hand on his rifle. He could put an 
explosive bullet close enough to kill 
the B’lant, and the breach of discip- 
line justified it. That he liked Vrebl 
was no factor. Still, killing was 
pretty final; maybe he could re- 
serve the option for a while, and 
sec what happened. At the worst, 
he could evade Vrebl — and Zaanj, 
if they joined forces — until the 
ship came. And Vrebl deserved 
some consideration for leaving the 
rifles, and the other things. 

It wasn’t just the breach of disci- 
pline, of course. Vrebl might be 
taken over by the grass-dwellers, 
and they might be able to absorb, 
somehow, what was stored in his 
brain. Vrebl knew quite a lot. 
Steve’s superiors might decide, as 
Gree had, to sterilize the planet. 

He pushed such thoughts from 
his mind. His own duty was to stay 
alive and sane until the ship arrived. 
Actually, he should be on his way 
now, to some hiding place. Still he 
stood watching the movement in 
the grass. 

Suddenly, Vrebl was on the ra- 
dio. “Please do not go away yet” 



Steve pushed the transmit button 
and said drily, “You know, you’re a 
pretty easy target.” 

“Yes, Colonel. And not only for 
you.” The voice was calm. 

Steve said coldly, “I suppose 
you’re looking for Zaanj.” 

“He is of my — clan is not ze 
right word.” 

“I appreciate that. But what 
about your duty?” 

“I do not zink I can become a 
zret to you, Colonel. Wiz all ze 
rifles you need not worry.” 

“Maybe so; maybe not. There 
may be things on this planet we 
haven’t met. Your duty was to stay 
with me so we could protect each 
other.” 

“Zat was part of ze gamble. If 
I am lucky, you will have ze mes- 
sage drones soon. I am looking for 
zem too, Colonel.” 

S teve grunted. That hadn’t oc- 
curred to him as Vrebl’s motive. 
“All right. As long as you’ve taken 
this upon yourself, I’ll spot for you. 
There are some movements in the 
grass about twenty-five yards tn 
your left as you face toward me. 
Also, a ways behind you, some of 
the grass-users were moving along 
a fence, in tandem. They’ve stopped, 
so I think they may hear you.” 
“Zank you, Colonel. Good-by for 
ze moment.” 

Steve tried hard to follow VrebPs 
progress, but he couldn’t hold the 
glasses entirely steady, and there 
were other stirrings to watch. He 
said on the radio, “I’ve lost you. 
Shake the grass so I can pick you 
up.” 



NO FRIEND OF GREE 



12f 




There was no answer. Steve 
opened his mouth to speak sharply, 
then hesitated. Vrebl might not dare 
to talk to him, nor even have his 
receiver turned on. He swept the 
glasses back and forth, but there 
was no movement such as he’d been 
following, though there were many 
gentler ones. Finally he lowered the 
glasses in despair. 

rinpe passed. He spoke into the 
radio | periodically, without response. 
He gpt up and paced, wondering 
why he hadn’t had the presence to 
call a ship back when he first en- 
countered the horribly afflicted thing 
at the campsite. At least, he could 
have sent a message. By not doing 
so, he’d lost one crewman, and 
probably two. He found it hard to 
understand what Vrebl was doing. 
To risk one’s life, with a fair fight- 
ing chance, was one thing; but this 

He glanced at his chronometer. 
Vrebl had been gone two hours, at 
least. What was he doing — criss- 
crossing back and forth in a search 
pattern? There was a ludicrous area 
to cover. 

Three more hours passed, then 
the radio suddenly blurted, “I have 
found him, Colonel, and we have ze 
drones. We are coming back.” 

H e watched the two figures 
emerge from the grass a full 
mile up the rift and plod down this 
side, at the foot of the talus. Zaanj 
walked with his head down, stum- 
bling now and then. 

Steve moved the equipment back 
from the edge of the cliff, hid two 
of the rifles, and chose his waiting 



spot. When they came into sight at 
the edge he was twenty yards from 
them, rifle steady. “Stand right 
there,” he ordered bleakly. 

Zaanj was naked and no longer 
had grass woven around him. Nei- 
ther were there any dead bugs stuck 
to him, and there were no marks 
on his hairless gray hide except a 
few at the neck. His face was swol- 
len, though, and his eyes were not 
quite right. His arms hung limp. 

Vrebl had the message drones, 
and some other stuff Zaanj had 
been carrying, clipped to two belts 
around his waist. Carefully, he un- 
fastened the drones one by one and 
dropped them on a soft area of 
moss. “I zink you should send a 
message at once, Colonel. But first 
I want you to know zat you have 
no enemies on zis planet.” 

Steve eyed him closely, then ges- 
tured with the rifle. “Move over 
there.” 

When they complied he went 
to the drones, picked one up and 
worked at its protective covering 
with one hand. He did not relax his 
watch either on Vrebl and Zaanj nor 
in other directions. “How do you 
know that, Vrebl?” 

“I am not Vrebl. He is sleeping.” 
The eyes met Steve’s calmly, with a 
little smile. “I am just using ze body, 
and ze brain.” 

Steve was not surprised. “If that’s 
so, why aren’t you like him?” He 
nodded toward Zaanj. “Or like the 
others?” 

“Because Vrebl offered himself 
voluntarily, and because we have 
learned finally how to move into ze 
humanoid body wizout damaging

IF 




ze brain. Before, we do it all wrong. 
Zat was what made ze horrible 
zings you saw. When we catch ze 
one named Zaanj, we almost do 
right, but we damage ze brain a 
Bttle. 1 zink he will get well. We 
ire sorry about zat, Colonel, but 
after all zis is our planet, and . 

“Which I should have let Gree 
fterilize,” Steve said flatly. “Is there 
any reason I shouldn’t burn the two 
of you down right now?” 

44XJo reason,” Vrebl’s voice said 
calmly, “except zat we are 
friendly. You can count ze message 
drones. Zey are all zere. I could 
have sent a false message, to tell ze 
ship you are dead and it should 
pick me up somewhere else. Zere 
is no reason we should lie to you, 
Colonel. We are no zret to your 
kind. We are not comfortable in 
zes bodies — even zo ze brains and 
ze eyes are wonderful; and ze inside 
bones and ze muscles ... I know all 
zat Vrebl knew, and I have talk 
wiz ozzers of my kind. We know 
Gree will return to destroy us. 
We know your side, ze Birds of 
Effogus, will be friends. Zerefore, 
to save my own planet I want to go 
wiz you, as an ambassador to ze 
Birds. I am telling you everyzing, 
Colonel. I do not zink you will 
doubt.” 



Steve got the drone free, pressed 
its recorder button and spoke into 
the receiver tersely but at length, giv- 
ing the facts that had to be given, 
ordering that a transcript be sent 
immediately to Headquarters and 
that the whole squadron except two 
sentries come to pick him up at 
once. He activated the drone, laid 
it on the ground, and stepped back. 
With a loud implosion, it nulled 
away. 

Without relaxing, he looked quick- 
ly around him to make sure nothing 
was sneaking in. Then he answered 
Vrebl, or what had been Vrebl. ‘7 
doubt everything. But the Birds will 
make the decision. You’ll both go 
back in sealed compartments, under 
heavy guard. So will I. We’ll stand 
right here, and be picked up in a 
few minutes.” 

He sighed. If it were left to him, 
he thought he might sterilize the 
planet, after a little study. On the 
other hand, possibly the entities 
would become friends and allies of 
the Birds, though he personally 
wasn’t eager for much contact with 
them. 

Anyway, he thought, there was 
one thing in their favor. Gree had 
wanted to destroy them; and, as he 
himself had once remarked, it was 
always good to disagree with Gree.

The Place Where Readers 
And Editor Meet... 



Dear Editor: 

I was disappointed when 1 re- 
ceived my March If. Skylark Du 
Quesne delayed another two months? 
Every month for the past year l 
have torn into each new If to see 
if there was any news on it. I 
have been going crazy trying to 
figure how even Doc Smith could 
write a sequel to Skylark of Valer - 
on. I sincerely hope June is the 
month. 

Now for the bright side of things. 
After little thought and deliberation 
(who needed it here?) I nominated 
If for the Hugo for 1964. For short 
stories another magazine had a 
slight edge on If, but for novels 
there was no comparison. 

For 1965 so far I have not yet 
seen any novels and only one short 
story worthy of a Hugo: The Repli- 
cators, by A. E. Van Vogt. Notice, 
7/ again! 

Authors you have now who I 
wish to see more of are Van Vogt, 
Schmitz, Young, Russell and espe- 
cially Keith Laumer. Two more 
whose short stories have not graced 
your pages recently are Hal Clem- 
ent and Robert Sheckley (he is 



good) . These are the best short- 
story writers. The rest are good, 
but rarely outstanding. 

As usual Cordwainer Smiths nov- 
el was a lemon. I think that it is 
the worst to appear in years. Star- 
child was a great disappointment. 
Both Jack Williamson and yourself 
have previously been exceptionally 
good, whether in collaboration or 
alone. But that??? 

On serials, I don't particularly 
like to wait one, two or three months 
to finish a story. However I do 
have a significant preference for 
novel-length stories. I think novels 
are the backbone of a sf magazine, 
and the shorts are an added luxury. 
So please, a serial in each issue, the 
longer the better. (About 93,000 
words.) My preference for novels 
got If my Hugo nomination. 

Lettercol: I would like a two to 
five page letter column in each 
issue of each magazine, discussing 
the science fiction in the magazine. 
Not the editorial or the articles. 

Story ratings: This is something 
you are missing that would improve 
the magazines tremendously. Less 
than a third of a page per issue. 



128 




Book reviews: Here I draw the 
Hne. One book review in Galaxy 
is okay, but please don’t expand to 
If or Worlds of Tomorrow. 

Editorials : A one or two page edi- 
torial on sf would be appropriate. 
Either on fandom or on authors or 
on stories. But please, none on

University, East Lansing, Michigan

• Hal Clement? Last month (and 
again soon!) Schmitz and Van 
Vogt? Next month. Sheckley? This 
month — but in Galaxy. And we’re 
after all the others you mention, 
too. — The Editor.

Dear Editor: 

I am struggling to understand 
the motives of Mr. A. E. Van Vogt. 
Does he have a lot of trouble getting 
published? Perhaps he is too old 
to be encouraged as various others 
were from time to time — but per- 
sonally, I am one who believes that 
his aliens — past and future — com- 
prise the most cogent theme in 
modern sf writing. 

If anyone can stir imagination 
among a bunch of lazy engineers, 
let that person be loudly applauded! 
— J. Alwood, Van Nuys, California. 

• Van doesn’t have a bit of trouble 
getting published, that’s for sure 
It seems there are simply other 
things he would rather do than 
write — but we’ve been pretty lucky 
about persuading him to change, as 
witness next month! — The Editor.

Dear Fred: 

I think the story your reader 
J. 0. Alyea of Missouri wants iden 
tified is Cloak of Aesir by Don A. 
Stuart . though it’s not a novel. 



One of the Master’s best, I think. 

What’s with all these Grees and 
Wockiis and so on? A veritabobble 

epidemic of them lately. Jim 

Blish. 

• As of press time about twenty 
other readers made the same iden- 
tification. What we can’t figure 
out is why we didn’t ! — The Editor.

Dear Editor: 

I just read Hue & Cry f in the 
April issue of If. It did my heart 
good to find that I am not alone in 
my objections to the cancellation of 
Outer Limits. I have written to 
ABC, TV Guide and now //, hoping 
for some sort of retaliatory move- 
ment. 

I am a devoted wife and a harried 
mother, with little time for writing. 
But I do not despair. My love for 
science fiction and my strong desire 
for a good television program keep 
my fingers and/or my hands as 
busy as possible. Since I have been 
reading sf for some six years, I 
think it is about time we sf fans 
bombarded ABC with our pleas for 
the return of Outer Limits — or per- 
haps, if my aspirations are not too 
high, something better! — Mrs. Eve- 
lyn L. Maher, 204 Webster Avenue, 
Jersey City, New Jersey, 07307.

Dear Editor: 

There has been so much Hue & 
Cry lately about alleged sf tele- 
vision that I was aroused from a 
twenty-year sleep long enough to 
write this letter. In the first place: 
Yes, I agree that horror movies are 
ruining all our good reputations. 
But no, I will not write to ABC 
and ask them to keep Outer Limits. 
I disagree with those of your read- 
ers who consider it the best show of 
its type. It is devoted to “no plot 
monster stories” — or was before 1

gave it up in disgust, some time ago. 

What is really needed is some 
thing new. A series, perhaps based 
on the Retief stories . there are 
endless possibilities. Anybody know 
a producer? — Charles Smith, 37 
Hinckley Road, Waban, Massachu- 
setts 02168.

Dear Editor: 

What’s happened? Ever since If 
went monthly it’s been the best 
around. It’s even better than Gal- 
axy. Glad you’re finally publishing 
E. E. Smith’s story — how about 
some more Heinlein or Asimov? 

For my money the best covers 
were January 1964 and March 1965. 
Let’s have more McKenna, what 
say? 

Can’t see where any readers 
could support that Outer Limits . 
Best sf on TV was some of the 
better shows on Twilight Zone. 
Ramona Alderson can see good TV 
when somebody figures out how to 
sell it to high-school kids and beer 
slops. 

Maybe some reader can help me. 
When, in which book or magazine 
and where, can I get a story called 
The Crystal Towerl As I recall, the 
story concerned a boy who escaped 
from the domesticated humans to a 
pack of wild humans and ended by 
taking off in a rocket with a girl 
It was either a long novelette or a 
novel. — David Lyon, 41 Cedar 
Street, Belfast, Maine.

Dear Editor: 

I wonder if you can help me? 
Solne time ago I read a science- 
fiction story about a man driven to 
desperation by the advertising gim- 
mickry of his age. He couldn’t 
walk down the street for the 
racket of blaring recorded commer- 
cials. He couldn’t ride in a bus 



or subway train for the big color 
television ads that carried nothing 
but loud hard sell. He couldn’t sit 
quietly in his room for the mech- 
anical birds that would sense him 
by his body heat and clamp them- 
selves onto his windows to deliver 
their sales message. So overwrought 
did this make him that he viciously 
conned his beloved (estranged) wife 
out of some $20,000 on the pretext 
of re-establishing housekeeping with 
her. Instead he took the money and 
bought for himself .a lifetime in 
Paradise. But “Paradise”, it turned 
out, was a commercial outfit that 
rented out rooms to the lucky few 
who could afford them — dull, gray, 
soundproofed rooms that could not 
be penetrated by advertising mes- 
sages. 

Anything you could do to help me 
trace this story would be very much 
appreciated. — James W. McLean, 54 
Prince Arthur Avenue, Toronto 5, 
Canada.

Dear Editor: 

I would like to congratulate you 
on two excellent issues in a row 
(November and December) and 
your first good cover illustrations 

since way back when. How about 

getting some more Poul Anderson 
stuff? He is the greatest. — Dave 
Spegel, 221 Anderson Road, Lin- 
wood, Michigan.

• Well, that’s it for another month. 
This issue’s “first” is Simon Says 
— one of the few novelettes we’ve 
published in our program of bring- 
ing you at least one brand new 
writer in each issue of //, hut, we 
think you’ll agree, worth it. Next 
month — del Rey, Van Vogt, Schmitz 
more of Doc Smith’s great Skylark 
DuQuesne — yes, indeed. See you 
then! — The Editor .
