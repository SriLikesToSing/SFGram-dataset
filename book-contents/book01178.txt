I 

ARTHUR Rodney walked through 
his little California house, 
calling his wife’s name, but only 
music answered him. The hidden 
sensors of the hifi system marked 
Art’s passage from room to room 
and as he passed the system chang- 
ed the music for him, blending 
each piece more or less smoothly 
into the next. When he entered the 
children’s room, where the two 
beds and a scattering of toys re- 
posed in a somehow ominous still- 
ness, there came from the speakers 
a cacophony of metallic sounds that 
bore an intended resemblance to a 
Iniby’scry. Little Timmy and Paula 
liad wanted that teenage stuff for 
their room, and he and Rita had 
agreed, though the kids were really 
far too young, but never mind that 
now, no one was there. The discor- 
dant metallic baby cries cut off 
when Art went out. 

In the master bedroom he was 
led the music of pulse-beating 
drums, fit for a wild and wiggling 
dance that must find its appro- 
priate end upon the bed. No one 
here, either. The glass in his wide 
windows (looking out over his 
neighbors’ desert landscaping, 
complete with plastic iguana) had 
darkened itself almost to opacity 
against the force of the California 
sun, but the sun was getting into 
(he bedroom anyway, reflecting 
blue and green through the depths 
of the inside-outside swimming 
pool. By this water-mottled light 



that quivered in all of the bed- 
room’s many mirrors Art saw that a 
small piece of white paper had been 
propped against the massage unit 
on his bedside table. He tossed his 
box of handcarved Staunton chess- 
men rattling onto the large circular 
bed, set his digital tournament 
clock down gently, and picked up 
the note, which was in Rita’s hand- 
writing. 

Darling, please believe that 1 love 
you as much as ever, but I must 
go away for a time. The kids are 
with me and will be okay. 1 really 
am pregnant again and Dr. 
Kuang says he has had to report 
my pregnancy to Family Plan- 
ning. It’s the law, as he says, and 
1 guess 1 can’t expect him not to 
report it. I will call you or at least 
write you soon so try not to 
worry. Love, Rita 

As he read. Art’s knees went 
weak with fear confirmed, and he 
sank down on the edge of the round 
bed. He glanced up at the overhead 
mirror, but learned nothing from 
the sight of his own slightly pudgy, 
dark-bearded face, pale and enig- 
matic in its shock. He looked down 
again and re-read the note three 
times and dropped it on the bed be- 
side him. 

Putting his weight on the bed 
had quickened the heartbeat of the 
hifi drums, though if he sat still the 
system would soon switch to sooth- 
ing, lulling music and in a little 



5 




while he would be granted silence. 
He could get up and turn the thing 
off but he felt too numb. Where to 
look for escape, for guidance? 
Where else but on the short book- 
shelf built into the wall beside his 
bed? The words of Eros are those of 
the true heart. Shortly he reached 
over and pulled out a well-fingered 
gray volume with Philosophy of 
Pleasure lettered on the cover in a 
beautiful and lively pink. But then 
he sat there holding the book un- 
opened. 

It was obvious that Rita had run 
off to her sister-in-law in Chicago. 
She would not have taken the chil- 
dren to leave them with anyone 
else. Rita meant to go into hiding 
somewhere and bear an unwanted 
child, even if she had to put it up 
for secret adoption later. Just the 
kind of thing that sister-in-law Ann 
would encourage her to do; quite 
likely it w'as Ann who had 
suggested the scheme to her in the 
first place . thought faded out 
into pain and shock. His wife was 
gone. 

How far pregnant was she? It 
couldn’t be more than ten weeks or 
so, he thought. He tried to 
remember when she had last gone 
off the pills for a menstrual week, 
but he had trouble keeping the 
dates in his mind, because his mind 
wanted to forget it. 

So it would have to be about six 
months before she bore the child, 
assuming she could remain in hid- 
ing and get away with it. If instead. 



as seemed more likely, the FP 
caught up with her and gave her 
her abortion anyway, she would 
probably go to jail. So it was in the 
cases one read about. In any case 
she was going to be gone for 
months. As well as being the 
mother of his children she was Art’s 
favorite sex partner, too. He 
opened the book and began to 
make plans for the changes in his 
sex life that would be brought 
about by Rita’s prolonged absence. 
After half a minute he realized 
what he was doing, threw the book 
aside, and went back to re-reading 
the note, hoping without real hope 
to find some less terrible interpre- 
tation of its words. But there was 
none. 

P ULLING the phoneplate toward 
him on the bedside table. Art 
started to punch out the number of 
Ann and George -Parr in Chicago. 
They had recently moved into a new 
house there — business at George’s 
karate school was evidently good — 
and the new number was still fresh 
in Art’s mind. He had looked it up 
for Rita last weekend. But when he 
was haltway through punching, he 
hesitated and then hit the blankoff 
key. Rita had been gone only a few 
hours at the most, and probably 
had not yet reached Chicago. Talk- 
ing to George was not likely to do 
any good since Ann would be the 
one most actively helping Rita — 
and arguing with Ann about any- 
thing was, in Art’s experience, cer- 



6 



GALAXY 




tain to be futile. Anyway it was not 
the kind of thing Art wanted to talk 
about over the phone. Best not to 
call at all but to go straight after 
Rita and for her own good compel 
her to behave sensibly. And the 
sooner he caught up with her the 
better. 

He reached for the phoneplate 
again, and this time tapped out the 
number of the Chess Director’s 
Office, in the mid-California 
branch of the Bureau of Arts and 
Games. There was a wait, with 
evanescent rainbow static on the 
plate. Then a man’s florid face ap- 
peared. 

“Oh, hi. Art,” the face said. 
“What’s up?” 

“Listen, Nick, I just called to say 
you’d better not pair me in for the 
first round of the Quarterly. I’m 
taking a little trip and I don’t know 
il‘ I’ll be back in time.” 

“Oh, okay. Let me know about 
the August Monthly, hey?” 

“Certainly 1 will. Go’th Eros.” 

“Goodbye.” 

For a moment Art continued to 
stare at the blank phone. In spite of 
his larger worries he found himself 
irritated by the Chess Director’s 
olfhand manner. Bureau of Arts 
people were supposed to believe in 
the importance of what they were 
lining; they should show at least a 
little formal regret when a rated 
master withdrew from an event. 
Nick had seemed as indifferent as a 
factory foreman checking atten- 
dance. 



The thought of factories remind- 
ed Art that in courtesy he should 
call his own place of employment 
before he left, but the chime of an 
incoming call forestalled him. 

On the plate appeared the face of 
a young woman, full-featured and 
of flawless skin. “May I speak to 
Ms. Rita Rodney, please? I’m Ms. 
Lazenby of the Bureau of Family 
Planning.” 

An unpleasant contraction in the 
stomach. “This is her husband. 
Ah, Rita’s not in the house right 
now. Ah, she’s out shopping some- 
where, 1 expect.” 

Ms. Lazenby smiled, a friendly 
smile that could become sympa- 
thetic if the need arose. “Actually, 
the reason for my call concerns you 
too, Mr. Rodney, and your two 
children.” She paused just enough 
for Art to have gotten a question in 
if he had felt the need. “Will you 
ask Rita to call me back as soon as 
possible if she returns home during 
business hours? We’re open until 
five. Or otherwise to call me in the 
morning at her earliest con- 
venience?” 

“1 will, yes. I’ll tell her that.” 

“Thank you,” Ms. Lazenby 
blanked off. 

Art sat clutching the phone. Dr. 
Kuang had smelled trouble com- 
ing, had called in Family Planning 
right away, reporting Rita as a 
problem case. Call back tomorrow, 
Ms. Lazenby, and you’ll probably 
get no answer, and you’ll be very 
suspicious that something’s up. But 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL

call back two or three days from 
now and you’ll have a willing Rita 
here to talk to you, I promise you 
that. Or maybe you’ll never have to 
call again, maybe by then the Cer- 
tificate of Abortion will already 
have been fed into your FP com- 
puter banks. 

What next? Oh yes, his job. Art 
punched out the number of the 
Macrotron Electronics plant in San 
Bernardino, and then the personal 
extension number of Pete Kinelo, 
his boss in the test-equipment 
maintenance and engineering de- 
partment. 

The plate showed the Macrotron 
trademark, and then the taped 
image of a girl who was nude or 
nearly so, it being impossible to tell 
at the moment because she was 
partly concealed behind a recep- 
tionist’s desk. A small vase of roses 
stood before each breast, so that 
her nipples were just concealed. 
“One moment, please,’’ the girl 
said, smiling pleasantly. “Your 
party has not yet answered his or 
her personal phone. We are con- 
tinuing to page your party; thank 
you for waiting.” 

The music of Swan Lake began. 
The girl affixed an electrostatically 
clinging sequin to each of her 
nipples, coyly displayed a G-string 
and wriggled into it, and then 
writhed up from behind her desk in 
an erotic dance. In a moment she 
was dancing along the shore of a 
lily-pond, and then in and out of 
the curtain of a small waterfall. 



Art waited impatiently, looking 
at his watch. There were several 
other calls that he should make. 
One was the bank, to see how much 
cash was readily available, in other 
words how much Rita had taken; 
fortunately he had come home to- 
day with the check for first prize in 
the Weekly in his pocket and so 
should at least be able to buy a 
ticket to Chicago. Another call 
would be to the Office of Transcon- 
tinental Transit, to see how soon he 
could get a seat on a tube train. 

At last the dancing girl was re- 
placed by the face of Pete Kinelo. 
“Art?” 

“Hello, Pete. I can take next 
week off, too.” 

“Oh, good.” Pete beamed 
through his thick glasses. “Then I 
can bring another substitute engi- 
neer in for a week. That’ll put us in 
real good shape on employee utili- 
zation. Say, there’s nothing wrong, 
is there?” 

“No, no. Ah, I’ve been winning 
quite a few prizes and I’ve got my 
nerve up. I’m going to try some of 
the big tournaments coming up 
around Chicago.” 

“Great. Fine. Be sure and let me 
know if you’re coming back week 
after next.” 

T he transcontinental train, a 
string of sealed metal cylinders 
almost windowless and almost 
silent in their movement, hurtled 
eastward through its buried tube at 
a steady supersonic speed. On

three-dimensional stages at the 
front of each car, feature-length 
tridi programs were being shown, a 
hangover from the days before 
competition with the airlines had 
been virtually ended by the latter’s 
susceptibility to hijacking, acci- 
dents, and weather. In Art’s car the 
life-sized, solid-looking, almost- 
real-looking images were enacting a 
play set in Victorian England, the 
locale of a lot of fiction these days. 

The story had something to do 
with the romantic pursuit of a prim 
London nursemaid by a young 
Icftenant (in the play they pro- 
nounced it that way) freshly return- 
ed from India. Obsessed as Art was 
with his own real problems, still the 
Irashiness of the play aroused in 
him an automatic disgust. There 
was no apparent limit to what they 
could get away with showing these 
(lays. Every second or third shot, or 
so it seemed, was a long lingering 
closeup of the heroine, showing her 
sw athed almost from chin to ankles 
in clothing that was not only loose- 
fitting but practically opaque. Only 
just enough of her shape and skin 
showed through to keep the Bureau 
of Arts censors from clamping 
down. Doubtless the producer 
would argue that in real Victorian 
lingland nothing had showed 
through, but, thank Eros, that was 
evidently not yet accepted as a valid 
argument by the censors and the 
courts. Ann, when he met her in 
Chicago, would probably be wear- 
ing something like this heroine’s 



clothes. Rita wouldn’t, though. She 
had better not. 

What would be the very best first 
words for him to say when he 
caught up with her? What kind of 
look should he put on his face? He 
thought a moment and then decid- 
ed there was no use trying to plan in 
such detail. Details would have to 
depend on the circumstances of the 
moment, on what her own attitude 
seemed to be. Of course he would 
have to be absolutely inflexible 
about terminating the pregnancy. 
No room for argument there. Rita 
could be stubborn, as he well knew, 
but this time he would be more 
stubborn. Maybe if he had taken a 
firm stand earlier, things would 
never have come to this pass . 
maybe. The trouble was that he 
could discern no single turning 
point; they had just drifted into it 
somehow. 

Of course, pregnancies did 
happen. There was really no shame 
in getting pregnant, for the third or 
the thirteenth time, the only shame 
was in not doing something about 
it. Yes, pregnancies happened, all 
right. They certainly happened to 
Rita, ever since he had known her. 

He had been teaching high 
school electronics when he met her; 
she was a student, though not in 
any of his classes, and eight years 
younger than he. They had been 
casual acquaintances until the 
Senior Prom for Rita’s class, at 
which Art had happened to be one 
of the chaperones. At the Prom — it 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL

had been held aboard a tube-train 
basically like this one, only a local, 
chartered to keep running in a 
closed loop around mid-California 
for a couple of days — the graduates 
in keeping with tradition broke out 
of their own age-group sexually for 
the first time, and Rita had spent a 
good deal of the Prom in the bed- 
room car with Art. He had felt a 
little guilty later about being dis- 
tracted so much from his 
chaperone’s duties, for there was 
some stargazing trouble in the bag- 
gage car — well, that sort of thing 
had happened before, and would 
again. 

A FEW WEEKS after the Prom, 
coming back from a vacation 
trip, he had accidentally — as he 
then thought — run into Rita while 
visiting the school for a one-day 
seminar. Later he was to realize 
with a warm glow that she had 
made a determined effort to locate 
and meet him on that day. In the 
course of casual conversation she 
mentioned to Art that she was preg- 
nant. 

“That’s too bad,” he commiser- 
ated mildly. In general he disliked 
hearing people talk about their ail- 
ments. “Do you suppose it happen- 
ed at the Prom?” 

“1 think it must have happened 
there.” Rita smiled at him, and 
brushed back her naturally blond, 
almost platinum hair, for which 
Art had declared his admiration a 
number of times, and which today 



seemed to have been newly curled. 
“Maybe it’s a little present from 
you.” 

“1 suppose it quite possibly is. 
The Prom was great fun, though, 
wasn’t it? 1 hope your escort wasn’t 
too put out with you for spending so 
much time with me.” 

Rita dismissed the problems of 
her Prom escort with a wave. 
“Great fun!” she agreed, but in the 
next moment smiled a little sadly. 
“Now it looks like I’m leaving my 
good old school days all behind.” 
Art was surprised. “Surely you’re 
going on to junior college at least?” 
“1 had planned to, but a preg- 
nancy sort of changes everything. 
At least for me it does.” 

“Why, won’t you be over all that 
before the fall term starts? Are 
there complications?” 

“I’m going to have the baby. 
Art.” About halfway through the 
Prom her calling him Mr. Rodney 
had stopped forever. 

“You’re what? I’m sorry, it’s 
none of my business, of course, 
but . 

“Going to bear the baby.” This 
calm determination was a side of 
her he had not seen before. 

“But why?” 

His shock dampened her enthu- 
siasm, if that was the right word for 
her attitude, but not her determi- 
nation, “That’s what my parents 
keep asking. It’s hard for me to ex- 
plain to anyone. It’s as if there were 
already a tiny baby inside me, de- 
pending on me. Though 1 can’t 



10 



GALAXY 




even feel it moving yet, of course.” 

“Hormonal changes are proceed- 
ing early. 1 suppose,” Art mutter- 
ed, to be saying something. As he 
had already said, it was none of his 
business — unless, he realized with 
a shattering silent flash, unless he 
wanted it to be. 

He had tried, as he thought, a lot 
of things in his life, but never mar- 
riage. Now it was getting to be time 
for marriage. And he liked this girl, 
liked her better each time he saw 
her. 

He said: “1 suppose your parents 
have pointed out to you that having 
a child already is bound to make 
things harder for you when the time 
comes when you want to get 
married. Not to mention the diffi- 
culty of raising it by yourself.” 

"1 know, you’re absolutely 
right.” Her frown admitted that it 
was a problem. “1 guess most men 
want to raise two kids that they 
think they might have fathered 
themselves.” 

And she, too, was right of 
course. It was a rare man who was 
certain of being the biological 
father of his wife’s two children. It 
took the trouble and expense of 
genetic testing to make sure, and 
lew were that concerned. You 
might as well accept the first two 
healthy ones that came and raise 
them as your own. If one of your 
neighbors’ kids was especially 
strong or smart or handsome, why 
you might nurse a hope that you 
were the sire. Conversely, if your 



wife gave birth to a child that 
seemed a little inferior, even 
though acceptably free of defects 
and certified human, you might tell 
yourself that someone else had 
fathered it. 

The really pertinent question 
was, would Rita Parr make him a 
good wife? From observing his 
married friends Art knew that you 
always wound up spending a lot of 
time with a marriage partner. It 
was also an important step to take 
because getting into and out of 
marriages all the time added up to 
a lot of trouble and expense — and 
you wanted the children, when they 
came, to have a stable home. 

He said: “Rita, I wish I knew you 
better.” 

They started dating regularly. He 
got to know her parents, and her 
likable brother George. He consid- 
ered the idea of marrying her from 
every angle, or tried to. On the few 
occasions when he saw his own 
parents he hinted at the prospect of 
coming marriage, and detected a 
mild glow' of approval in response, 
which, of course, was as much as he 
could expect; it had been a long 
time since what he did was of deep 
concern to them, or vice versa. 

He and Rita were together more 
or less constantly for several 
months. He became convinced that 
she wanted very much to marry 
him. They quarreled, and then 
made up. In the spring her Timmy 
was born and Art sent flowers to 
her at the hospital and a few days 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL

later came to pay her a visit at 
home. 

Rita, sitting in a rocking chair in 
her bedroom and feeding the baby 
from a nursing bottle, said to Art: 
“You know, I still think he’s yours. 

1 have that feeling about him, and 
I’m glad.” 

Studying the small wizened face, 
still bruised from the violence of 
birth. Art could find in it no resem- 
blance to himself. But he realized 
that he was hoping to find a resem- 
blance and, giving this some 
solitary thought a little later, he de- 
cided it was enough to tip the 
balance. A month later he and 
Rita, now legally, financially, and 
socially united in the bonds of 
matrimony, moved into a new 
apartment with little Tim. 

AFTER marriage, as before, he and 
Rita preferred to spend most 
of their free time in each other’s 
company. After marriage Art ex- 
perienced only one or two orgasms 
per month with anyone except his 
wife. And while he wasn’t sure, he 
had the impression that Rita’s sex 
life was even more intensely con- 
centrated on him. He should have 
made a point of finding out. Such 
concentration of lust was one of the 
danger signals that the popular 
psychologists were always harping 
on, a sign that one’s sexual atti- 
tudes might be somehow warped. 

They had been married, quite 
happily for the most part, for two 
years when Rita surprised him with 



the announcement that she was 
pregnant again. It was really a sur- 
prise because they had both been 
taking anti-fertility pills, which cer- 
tainly should have given adequate 
protection. But, as Dr. Kuang ex- 
plained, the pills were not one hun- 
dred per cent certain. Anyway the 
pregnancy was no real problem; 
they had caught it quite early and 
he could do a menstrual extraction 
right now in his office if they 
wished. 

Oh. no. Although Rita, too, 
seemed surprised and not at all as 
calm as she had been about her 
first pregnancy, she was if anything 
even more determined that this one 
should produce a baby. To her the 
fetus was a person inside her belly, 
as if someone had taken a real baby 
and stuffed it in there. Her new 
baby was alive already, and she 
must protect its life. As far as Art 
could tell she had not absorbed this 
dogma from any of the few religious 
or “humanistic” sects which still 
maintained it as official doctrine. 
.She had arrived at it by herself. 

Naturally Art saw more of her 
during this pregnancy than he had 
during the previous one, and by 
now could more easily read her 
moods and guess her thoughts. 
What he saw this time began to 
frighten him. The first time he had 
thought she was simply being stub- 
born on the subject, acting in an 
immature, adolescent way. This 
time she seemed in the grip of some 
enormous force, a force bent on 



12 



GALAXY 




using her for making babies. In- 
deed, she refused even to discuss 
the possibility of getting an abor- 
tion. She even refused to take the 
tests that would predict whether 
her fetus was likely to grow into a 
deformed child; deformed or not, 
she said, it was her baby still. If Art 
persisted in trying to talk to her 
about it she quivered and suffered, 
seemingly outraged to the point of 
pain. 

Well, Art had always more or 
less expected his wife to have two 
children. And people said it was 
more convenient if your two kids 
were about the same age. They 
could play together, and you got 
I he diapering and the rest of the 
messy business over with once and 
lor all. Since Rita was so deter- 
mined to have this one. why not? 

A couple of days after Paula was 
born Art called Dr. Kuang to talk 
over the best means of insuring 
against another pregnancy. Frown- 
ing from the phoneplate, Dr. 
Kuang told him that Rita’s psyeho- 
logical profile showed that surgical 
sterilization w'as definitely not indi- 
cated in her case. He would 
prescribe new pills for her. “And of 
course having a vasectomy yourself 
will help. And, with male partners 
w ho are known to be strongly virile, 
she should choose sex activities 
other than copulation.” 

Otie trouble was that sex activi- 
ties other than copulation were not 
much fun for her. One good thing 
was that she so rarely brought any 



man but Art to orgasm. He hastily 
got his vasectomy; in six months or 
so the residual sperm in his duct- 
work would presumably all have 
had their chance and he would be 
permanently and completely sterile. 

He had done all he could, or so 
he thought. Meanwhile he had 
switched from teaching electronics 
to working at it, for Macrotron; 
also he had begun to spend more 
time away from home, improving 
his chess rating and winning more 
prizes. And then one day he came 
home and found a note. 

11 

T he suggestive dialogue of the 
pseudo-Victorian play nagged 
at Art’s attention, pulling him away 
from the fruitless game of trying to 
guess how' he might better have 
managed his life with Rita in the 
past. He looked for the set of ear- 
plugs that should have been attach- 
ed to his seat, intending to drown 
out the play with music or a sooth- 
ing waterfall of gentle noise, but 
found to his disgust that one plug 
of the set w'as missing. Its con- 
nector of steel-jacketed wire had 
been neatly severed by some 
vandal, w ho seemed to have gone to 
the trouble of using a cutting torch. 

He w as not going to be able to 
avoid hearing the struggle of Phyllis 
and Rodney (the nursemaid and 
leftenant, respectively) against 
their mutual lust, a struggle in 
which he was sure they would even- 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



13 




tually be victorious, but at least 
nothing forced him to watch the 
repulsive sight. Art now kept his 
face turned most of the time to the 
small window beside his luxurious 
chair. In the buried tunnel there 
was of course nothing to be seen ex- 
cept advertisements, the kind that 
were now starting to be called flick- 
ersigns. These were glowing adjura- 
tions that might be a hundred kilo- 
meters long, lettered in elongated 
characters designed to be intelli- 
gible only to one hurtling past them 
at a distance of a few centimeters 
and a speed of hundreds of kilo- 
meters per hour. 

Art was reading one such ad, 
without absorbing an iota of its 
meaning, when without warning 
the train was thrown into violent 
deceleration. It was braking at 
emergency rate from jet-aircraft 
speeds, seemingly coming to a halt. 
In an instant the great plastic 
flowers of airbags bloomed before 
each seat, their multiple release 
coming with the sound of a single 
explosion. 

A second after they had bloom- 
ed, the bags were soft and deflating 
once again, sagging into plastic 
detumescence. “Phyllis,” said the 
tridi leftenant’s voice, loud and 
clear in the first breathless moment 
of alarm among the passengers, 
who were only now reacting to be- 
ing slammed in the face by plastic 
bags, “1 am not an animal, to hurl 
myself upon you.” 

Phyllis’s reply was drowned out 



by a general commotion among the 
passengers. In Art’s car about half 
the seats were occupied, and the 
people were now exchanging ex- 
clamations, questions, and com- 
ments. As Art rubbed his nose 
where the bag had stung him a 
woman seated across the aisle look- 
ed over and asked him, almost 
pleadingly: “It must be just 

something wrong with the machin- 
ery, don’t you think?” 

Bracing his arms on the seat be- 
fore him, against the continuing 
heavy deceleration, he tried to give 
her a reassuring nod. “Yes, it must 
be.” But he recalled the missing 
earplug; the Transon tubes were 
not immune to vandals, not any 
more at least, and therefore prob- 
ably not immune to apes, or to 
terrorists of one persuasion or an- 
other. Glancing at his wristwatch, 
he determined that at the moment 
the train must be somewhere under 
the Great Plains, only a few hun- 
dred kilometers from his destina- 
tion. Now the deceleration eased 
markedly. A look at the blur of 
tunnel wall and flickersign outside 
the little window indicated that the 
train was now moving not much 
faster than an automobile. 

As the train continued to slow to- 
ward a full stop, the tridi play was 
interrupted. A man’s voice, strong 
and reassuring and probably re- 
corded, issued from the speakers 
on the momentarily empty stage. 
“Ladies and gentlemen, there is no 
cause for alarm.” The voice paused 



14 



GALAXY 




as some decision-making process, 
human or electronic, selected the 
next phrase. “A technical difficulty 
has arisen. To minimize your in- 
convenience until your trip can be 
safely resumed, you will shortly be 
conducted to the surface by com- 
pany guides. When the train stops, 
please remain seated until the 
guides arrive at your car. There is 
no cause for alarm.” 

Immediately a girl’s tremulous 
voice added: “Rodney? I — I’ve al- 
ways wanted a — a large family.” A 
moment later Phyllis’s image, as 
heavily garmented as ever, was 
back on stage, confronting the 
image of Rodney, who was standing 
in such a way that his uniform’s flat 
lack of any bulging codpiece could 
not very well be ignored. 

The airbags by now were nothing 
but w rinkled draperies on the seats. 
The passengers, who had quieted to 
get whatever news they could from 
I he recorded announcement, were 
now babbling again and some of 
them were standing up. The 
woman across the aisle was once 
more addressing herself to Art but 
he could not hear her in the general 
noise. Now' she got up and ap- 
l)ioached Art. to stand hovering 
over him. He unthinkingly took this 
as a sexual invitation and began to 
caress her hips, bare except for a 
(j-string. but she gave only a per- 
functory wiggle of response and he 
realized that her intent was to peer 
out of the little window beside his 
seat. 



“Is that water in the tunnel?” 
she asked in a loud, clear voice, 
looking out. Other passengers 
heard her words and echoed them, 
and alarnu began to mount. 

Art took a turn at the window, 
trying to squint down at a difficult 
angle along a curve of dim con- 
crete. The tunnel was circular in 
cross-section, as was the. train, 
which filled it nearly from side to 
side and top to bottom. It was hard 
to see anything but Art thought 
there was at least some wetness on 
the concrete wall. 

“Yes, it was a Thug who 
strangled him,” groaned a gray- 
haired senior officer in full dress 
uniform upon the stage, “but I am 
the one really responsible for my 
son’s death.” 

AND THAT was the last of the play. 

The phantoms vanished from 
the stage again, as behind it, with a 
hiss and a clack, an emergency 
door opened in the front of the car. 
In a moment a man in a blue trans- 
lucent uniform had come through 
the door and climbed upon the 
stage. Looking at first no more real 
than Rodney or Phyllis, he wore a 
hard helmet of blue plastic, with a 
clear faceplate, and carried some 
kind of pistol bolstered at his belt. 
His stern expression eased into a 
professional smile as soon as a 
quick glance through the car as- 
sured him that all was peaceful. He 
stepped down briskly in front of the 
stage, making room for two more 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



15 




men, similarly dressed and armed, 
to mount it from behind. 

The man who had entered first, 
and who wore stripes on his sleeves 
like those of a military sergeant, 
leaned casually on one of the front 
seats and addressed the passengers 
in a loud but friendly voice. 
“There’s nothing to worry about, 
folks. The company regrets the in- 
convenience. We’ll just have to 
walk a few steps through the 
tunnel, that’s all. Will you all 
follow me out, please, through the 
front of the train?” 

Eager as they were to get out of 
confinement and on their way 
again, the sergeant had no trouble 
keeping them moving past him and 
onto the stage and over it, while his 
two aides went on to the rear of the 
car, presumably to start evacuating 
people from the next car in that 
direction. 

“Nossir, there’s no flood,” the 
sergeant reassured a man who had 
mounted the stage ahead of Art. 
“It’s no more than a puddle. Just 
some kind of equipment break- 
down. Keep moving. This way out, 
please.” 

A few people were burdened with 
enough luggage to make getting 
over the stage a struggle for them, 
and Art felt like offering a hand, 
but he would have had to back up 
or push ahead in line to do so, and 
he judged it better to keep the 
evacuation moving smoothly. So far 
all was going well enough, con- 
sidering. 



He and his fellow passengers had 
to pass through two cars ahead of 
the one they had ridden in, sur- 
mounting another tridi stage in 
each, before an open door in the 
very front of the train let them 
descend a short, steep, folding 
emergency stair into the darkness 
of the tunnel. Maybe the sergeant 
had spoken too soon about there 
being no flood, or maybe he had 
simply been lying to prevent a 
panic. From somewhere ahead, be- 
yond the point where the file of 
passengers preceding Art vanished 
in the gloom, there came a sound of 
heavy splashing, as of wading, 
shuffling feet. And now he could 
distinguish another watery noise, as 
of a minor waterfall. The tunnel 
seemed to slope downward grad- 
ually ahead of the train, so it was 
natural that the water, wherever it 
was coming from, would be deeper 
there. 

A pebble’s toss ahead of Art one 
of the guides — they were really 
Transcon’s uniformed private po- 
lice, of course — was shining a 
pocket flash about, and someone 
else was doing the same thing much 
farther on. The only other illumina- 
tion was that which shone feebly 
from inside the train, and from a 
dim red glowing line embedded in 
the tunnel wall and stretching 
crooked and broken into an inde- 
terminate distance. Art realized 
that this was an elongated flicker- 
sign symbol; if he had been 
compelled to guess, he would have 



16 



GALAXY 




said it was a question mark. 

Following the vague form of the 
passenger ahead, he felt the water 
rise to slosh about his ankles. Now 
in the glow of the flickersign he 
spotted the water leak, or at least 
one leak. From a small crack in the 
concrete near the tunnel’s curving 
top. a kitchen-faucet-sized stream 
came burbling down the concavity 
of wall. But at least swimming was 
not going to be necessary, for now 
just ahead another sergeant with 
another pocket flash was lighting 
the file of evacuees into a doorway 
set into the curved concrete of the 
tunnel wall. When Art neared the 
door he saw just beyond it the steep 
steps of a service stair ascending in 
a tight helix. 

He climbed in the wet footprints 
of those ahead. At a landing that 
Art hoped was near the top, but 
later proved to have been approxi- 
mately halfway up, another police- 
man was stationed to urge them on. 
It was a good thing there was no- 
body in a wheelchair. “Step right 
up, folks. When you’re all assem- 
bled on the surface we’ll see you 
safely across the river, then get you 
on another train. Sorry for the 
inconvenience. This way . .’’ 

A black woman past middle age, 
gasping from the climb, wearing gi- 
gantic false breasts and an obvious 
merkin of false pubic hair beneath 
her transparent gown, stepped out 
of line to argue. “River? What river 
is this? Why were we halted here, 
for sex’s sake?”

Some months ago we went to a screening 
of a whacky and wonderful movie — sort of 
Mack Sennett waiting for Godot in 
2201 . absurd! We loved It! So we got 
on the horn to Hollywood and tied up book 
rights for Dark Star. Already the rage at 
the Trieste cult flick of the 70’s. If any- 
thing could possibly go wrong aboard the 
scoutship Dark Star sooner or later It 
would. Now In the 20th year of Its mis- 
sion — track down rogue planets and de- 
stroy them — the ship and its crew were 
falling apart, literally. After years in 
space, the four surviving crew members 
are bored beyond relief. Only an oc- 
casional bomb run or another of the Inevi- 
table malfunctions aboard ship upsets the 
monotony. 

Then, Bomb #20 Is primed, armed and 
set to detonate automatically. Suddenly 
life on board the ship becomes frantic. See 
the movie . read the book by Alan 
Dean Foster — there has never been any- 
thing quite like it. Walt till you meet the

Great fun! “Every scene, every se- 
quence, every schtick and aside was flaw- 
less. The sets are perfect, the visual effects 
magirificent . many years of love went 
Into it.” That fiom the reviewer of the Los 
Angeles Free Press. BB 



“It's the Mississippi, lady,” said 
the officer, politely gesturing her 
upward, then when she still delay- 
ed, taking her arm with easy firm- 
ness and propelling her along. 
“You’re almost in Chicago. Don’t 
be alarmed, we’ll get you through 
in good shape.” 

Maybe three hundred kilometers 
to go. Art estimated. As he climbed 
on, he could still hear the guide’s 
voice from behind: “Have to keep 
moving, folks. No telling how high 
the water’ll come up these stairs if 
the tunnel should collapse down 
there. Step along, please. If you 
should see a little light rioting on 
the surface, don’t let it throw you. 
Just assemble where you’re told, 
and we’ll see you through.” 

O F COURSE there was adequate 
lighting on the stair, but still it 
was good to finally distinguish day- 
light coming from above. At its top 
the stair delivered its stream of 
refugees into a graceful low con- 
crete structure that was open on 
three sides to the late summer after- 
noon. The structure looked as if it 
might serve as a picnic shelter on 
more peaceful days. It stood sur- 
rounded by a half-wooded, park- 
like area. The near bank of the 
wide, placid river was little more 
than a stone’s throw away, at the 
bottom of a broad gentle grassy 
slope. The sun was lowering over 
the woods behind Art’s back as he 
faced across the river toward a solid 



18 



GALAXY 




array of wooded bluffs that rose 
above the distant shore. 

In and around the shelter lay 
many pieces of freshly splintered 
wood that might very recently have 
formed picnic tables and benches, 
and nearby a trash container lay on 
its side, meager contents scattered. 
But there were no rioters in sight. 
Some forty or fifty passengers with 
Iheir luggage, apparently all who 
had preceded Art up from the 
tunnel onto the grass, were stand- 
ing in loose formation close by the 
shelter, like some motley levee of 
inducted troops about to begin 
their training. A single uniformed 
policeman stood casually before 
them, giving them something to 
look at, at least. Three more police, 
one wearing inconspicuously on his 
collar what Art supposed was an 
officer’s insignia, were standing 
inside the shelter. One of these 
carried a radio buzzing with distant 
messages. With the three police 
was a shivering middle-aged man 
wearing a translucent coverall and 
thick, tough-looking clear boots 
with mud dried on them. For a 
moment Art thought that this man 
too was armed, but then he saw 
that the bolstered object at his 
waist was an electronic calculator. 

Following the gaze of these men. 
Art saw' that the park was becom- 
ing not so peaceful after all. Down 
near the water people were emerg- 
ing at a run from the concealment 
of some trees. The people were 
mostly men, running like clowns in 



twos and threes and half-dozens, 
whooping and waving. There were 
twenty or twenty-five of them alto- 
gether, and they might have been 
playing a game, or just scampering 
in high good spirits. One was 
waving a festoon of what appeared 
to be cables or plastic tubing. 

The man with the calculator at 
his belt was talking rapidly to the 
police; with a little sideward glance 
he included Art in his audience, 
and went right on. “So we had our 
boat close in toward the west bank 
here, taking sediment samples, and 
just as I turned to say something to 
Carl, why pow, this rock went by 
my head and missed me by about a 
centimeter. And then I heard this 
mob up on the bank start yelling. 
Sex, once you hear a yell like that 
you know what it is, it means a 
bunch of people have all gone ape. 
Carl had his helmet off, see, but he 
still had his diving suit on, and it 
must have looked almost opaque 
and they must have thought we 
were from the monastery. I gunned 
the boat to get out from the shore, 
and then we must have hit some- 
thing, a log or a piece of junk. 
When I came up for air that mob 
was heaving more rocks, there were 
splashes all around me. I ducked 
under and swam and waded, and 
came downstream about half a 
kilometer and climbed out here 
when I saw' the uniforms. Never saw 
what happened to Carl. I hope he 
managed to grab his helmet and 
tanks before he went under.”

The capering people near the 
riverbank had disappeared into the 
trees again. 

“Looks like they’ve got her burn- 
ing, finally,” one of the police said, 
squinting to the north, where the 
bank of the river on which they 
were standing mounted higher in 
tree-clothed bluffs. Rooted some- 
where among the trees atop the 
bluffs, an ominously burgeoning 
growth of black smoke towered like 
the djinn of riot above the country- 
side. 

“Must have been an old build- 
ing,” another policeman remarked. 

“Did someone say it was a 
monastery?” Art put in, shocked at 
the indication of bigotry without 
being surprised by it. 

“Yes,” the river engineer (or 
whatever the man with his calcu- 
lator was) answered. “Oh, not 
Church of Eros. One of the old 
Christian ones.” 

“That’s hardly an excuse.” Art 
watched the plume of smoke grow 
fatter. All this time a continuing 
trickle of passengers were continu- 
ing to emerge from the stairhead 
and straggle into place in their 
loose formation on the green. 

“Well, I live around here,” one 
of the police commented. “Not 
right for people to take the law into 
their own hands, but what can you 
expect? The rumor has been going 
around that the monkeymonks up 
there have been carrying on some 
kind of experiments with abortion 
specimens. Not just the kind where 



the scientists gain knowledge from 
them, but creating some kind of 
monsters. Chastity, I don’t believe 
all 1 hear, but how do you expect 
people to take it when they’re so 
mysterious?” 

No one said anything for a little 
while. A poor attitude for even a 
private policeman to take, thought 
Art, practically condoning rioting 
and vandalism. But it would be 
futile to argue. 

Shortly the engineer remarked: 
“Here come a couple more refu- 
gees.” Hiking across the inviting 
park, from the direction opposite 
the smoke, came a couple who had 
evidently been picnicking, for he 
carried a red plastic picnic cooler 
and she a small outdoors pack and 
a folded translucent blanket. 

The man was tall, lean, thirtyish, 
and freshly sunburnt. The girl was 
a full-bodied brunette of eighteen 
or twenty. As they drew ndar. Art 
saw that what he had at first taken 
for sunglasses on her face were 
really artificial eyes of what must be 
an. advanced design. They might 
have been opaquely dark sun- 
glasses except that the thickness of 
their bulky frames was molded in 
flush to the skin, all around her 
eyes. She was neatly and modestly 
dressed in a sports bikni of the 
latest style, her translucent bra ex- 
tended in twin peaks by finger-long 
cones of pinkish nipple-colored 
plastic. 

As the couple approached the 
shelter, the man spoke to the police 



20 



GALAXY 




in a husky, somewhat hurried 
voice. “Officers, we’re very glad to 
see you. I hope you can provide us 
with some kind of escort back 
across the river, or get us on the 
train to Chicago if possible. Our 
boat was destroyed, you see.”' The 
girl said nothing, looked around 
nervously, and stayed close to her 
companion. She looked at Art, but 
he had trouble reading her expres- 
sion; the artificial eyes functioned 
like a mask. Faint cat’ s-eye gleams 
shone in their dark lenses, and the 
plastic frames were studded with 
artificial jewels. Or could those 
stones possibly be genuine? 

“Sure, you can come along,” the 
officer with the collar insignia said. 
“Got your boat too, hey?” He 
changed his position and stretched 
as the last rescued passenger, 
sitting in a wheelchair (so there had 
been one, after all) was heaved into 
view at the stairhead by a team of 
puffing police. “I guess we’re all 
here now. Let’s start getting these 
people over the water.” 

T he two saved picnickers 
walked beside Art to join the 
other evacuees. As the whole group 
with its escort of police began to 
move, the girl let out a sudden, 
choked little cry, and Art saw her 
actually begin to tremble. Follow- 
ing the direction of her gaze, he be- 
held a new eruption of rioters boil- 
ing out of the woods and cutting 
across the passengers’ path, evi- 
dently with the intention of inter- 



cepting them before they could 
reach the river. Art now also saw in 
midstream a large launch that had 
evidently just been called from 
across the river and was now head- 
ing in to the near bank where a 
small dock waited at the end of the 
passengers’ present line of march. 

The march continued. The 
officer barked an order or two, and 
his blue-uniformed men, now 
about a dozen strong, closed in be- 
side the much more numerous 
troop of people they were convoy- 
ing, their screen forming most 
tightly at the point where the threat 
was greatest. 

There were perhaps thirty people 
in the mob approaching. Half a 
dozen or so were women, and these 
were screaming loudly, urging on 
the men. Most of the men wore the 
gaudily colored and oversized cod- 
pieces favored these days among 
the youth of the Basic Income class. 
One who was so garbed, a large, 
florid young man with close-set 
eyes, went right up to the police line 
and peered over uniformed shoul- 
ders at the shrinking sheep behind 
as if about to choose one for 
slaughter. 

“Any triplet priests in there?” 
the florid one demanded. “Any 
sublimatin’ vivesectionists? We got 
one already, but there’s some more 
experiments we’d like to try.” He 
seemed on the point of trying to 
push his way through the protective 
line, and one of the bigger police 
shoved him roughly back. When he

demonstrated anger at this treat- 
ment he found himself looking at a 
drawn handgun. 

“We’re just passing through, 
bigmouth,” the policeman told 
him. “Now you just pull your jaw 
out of our way and let us pass.” 

There were no firearms visible 
among the rioters, and indeed Art 
could not see that they carried 
weapons of any kind. The sight of 
the gun knocked them back almost 
like a physical force. Moving like 
the cells of some multiple or- 
ganism. keeping together as if 
under the control of a single mind, 
they fell into retreat. 

One we got already. The words 
echoed in Art’s mind. But maybe 
they were only brag and bluff. 

The passengers with their convoy 
of police moved on unmolested to- 
ward the dock, which was now only 
about a hundred meters off. The 
immediate threat was apparently 
over but the girl with artificial eyes, 
walking beside Art, continued to 
breathe as if on the verge of hy- 
steria. Her escort held her by the 
arm and kept speaking to her in a 
low voice, but his efforts to calm 
her had little effect. 

The police, evidently to keep a 
prudent distance from a patch of 
dense woods into which the rioters 
had retreated, had bent the con- 
voy’s line of march almost parallel 
to the river. Now in those infested 
woods another outbreak of shout- 
ing rose up, blended with the noises 
of running feet trampling the 



undergrowth. The girl moaned and 
moved away from the noise, leaning 
against Art like a frightened child. 
He put an arm around her full body 
and squeezed it in a polite caress. 
“My name’s Art, by the way. 
What’s yours?” 

He would scarcely have been sur- 
prised to receive no answer, but one 
came. “Rosamond. Rosamond 
Jamison. Oh!” 

Now from the woods came a 
man’s voice shouting, but words in- 
distinguishable but pain, fear, and 
despair all blended in. The man 
who was walking on the other side 
of Rosamond Jamison froze in his 
tracks, so quickly that those walk- 
ing behind him had trouble avoid- 
ing a collision. “That was Steve,” 
he said to himself in a low voice 
that Art nonetheless overheard dis- 
tinctly. In another moment Rosa- 
mond’s escort had caught up with 
the police lieutenant- and was 
grabbing at his shoulder. “Did you 
hear that? A man’s in trouble over 
there. Aren’t you going to do some- 
thing?” 

The voice shouted again, this 
time in terrible wordless agony. 

The lieutenant, who had started 
to say one thing, began again with 
something else. “I’ve got my own 
job to do, getting these people 
safely on their way. That could be 
some kind of a trick, just to get us 
into the woods.” 

“No it isn’t. Didn’t you hear that 
scream just now? You think that 
could have been a trick?” 



22 



GALAXY 




The lieutenant, inflexible, shook 
his head. ‘Tve got my orders, my 
job. That’s it.” 

“You can’t just go on.” 

The lieutenant turned away. 

The tall, sunburnt man, anxiety 
unabated, hurried back to Rosa- 
mond. “Here.” To her he gave the 
weighty-looking picnic cooler. She 
(ook it automatically and carried it 
with some difficulty as she continu- 
ed moving forward with the refugee 
eolumn. The man said to Art: “Try 
and look out for her, will you? See 
that she gets on a train to Chi- 
cago?” 

“Of course, I’ll try to help. But 
what are you — ?” 

Muttering some last, unintelli- 
gible phrase over his shoulder, the 
man was gone. Moving with unex- 
pected strength and speed, he had 
pushed his way through the police 
escort on the inland side and was 
running toward the woods before 
anyone but Art became aware of his 
intention. 

“Halt!” the lieutenant bellowed, 
when he did catch on. “Come back 
here! Don’t be a sublimatin’ fool!” 
The fleeing man did not pause or 
turn. In another moment he was 
out of sight in the woods. Rosa- 
mond, struggling forward with her 
picnic cooler, looked after her com- 
panion only briefly and then faced 
forward again, concentrating her 
efforts on keeping up with the con- 
voy’s rapid pace. She was having a 
hard time doing so now. In the rear 
of the column shifts of volunteers

were practically carrying the wheel- 
chair and its terrified occupant. 

Art put a hand on the cooler’s 
carrying grip. “Let me help.” 

“Oh, thank you.” But she 
seemed reluctant to let him take the 
weight. When he did so, however, 
they made better time. 

The boat, which was moored at 
the dock by the time they got there, 
proved to be some sort of sight-see- 
ing craft, evidently commandeered 
for this occasion. With all the refu- 
gees aboard, it was quite crowded, 
and some had to sit or squat on the 
deck between rows of seats. Most of 
the police remained behind on 
shore, and as the boat pulled away 
from the dock Art saw them be- 
ginning to march in loose forma- 
tion back up the slope toward the 
emergency exit from the tube. 
Other trains would be arriving 
behind his. Art realized. 



ALONG THE eastern, Illinois shore 
the woods looked wilder and 
less park-like than those of Iowa 
just left behind. When the boat 
scraped bottom on the eastern side, 
the police pilot made an announce- 
ment, straining to be cheerful. 
“Folks, will you all wait right here 
in this area, please? We have to 
take the boat back across the river 
and pick up some people from 
another eastbound train. Then 
we’ll get you all on your way to Chi- 
cago very shortly. Get off the boat 
promptly please, step right into the 



water there. It’s not deep.” There 
was no dock here on the eastern 
shore and one policeman was in the 
water himself, handing passengers 
off into the knee-deep Mississippi. 
Plenty of volunteers rallied around 
the wheelchair again, with grins 
and jokes. People were sometimes 
marvelous. 

A few steps had to be taken on 
the oozy river bottom to reach the 
muddy shore. Once on solid ground 
most of the passengers gravitated 
inland, as if hoping, in spite of 
what the guides had said, that there 
might be another tube terminal 
right at hand. Thirty or forty 
meters inland a narrow unpaved 
road roughly paralleled the river, 
but traffic seemed nonexistent. Be- 
yond the road and behind a wire 
fence, the tree-covered bluffs rose 
up unpromisingly. The passengers 
who had probed the farthest soon 
came back with unhopeful reports. 
There was apparently no place to 
go and nothing to do but wait as 
they had been told. No one knew 
where the point of access to the 
eastbound tunnel might be. 

Art and Rosamond, having the 
cooler to carry and both of them 
lacking any desire for an aimless 
hike, remained somewhat behind 
most of the other passengers as the 
latter drifted up to hang around the 
road. The two of them sat down 
upon a grassy bank where the sun, 
now lowering close over Iowa, still 
shone brightly. Rosamond was 
quiet, and seemed less fearful now.

though she was still looking intently 
back over the river. 

“He’ll probably come over in the 
next boatload,” Art offered, trying 
to be comforting. “He’s probably 
all right and they’ll be able to pick 
him up and bring him along.” 

She turned to him and reached 
across the cooler to tickle the palm 
of his hand, and smiled at him be- 
neath her enigmatic eyes. “I think I 
would enjoy some sex right about 
now.” 

“Of course.” 

They spent an enjoyable ten 
minutes at it, with Art’s paper shirt 
spread over the rough grass be- 
neath their bodies. Afterward as 
they lay together relaxing Rosa- 
mond began to shiver; the sun was 
so low that it had lost its heat, and 
a cool breeze had come up. In a 
little while she sat up and pulled 
her discarded bikni on again but of 
course it was too small to provide 
any real warmth. Art picked up the 
paper shirt, now notably wrinkled 
and soiled, and held it out. “Afraid 
this is the best 1 can offer you. 
There doesn’t seem to be a clothing 
vendor anywhere around.” 

“You’ll be cold, won’t you?” 
“I’m a little fat.” He stood up 
and adjusted his codpiece and 
transparent trousers. “I guess that 
helps to keep one warm.” 

Rosamond pulled on the shirt, 
and then sat down in the grass 
again with her legs crossed, feet 
and all tucked completely in under 
the garment so that it fell around 



her like a small tent. The shadow of 
a bush fell over her now and in the 
dulled light the shirt was practically 
opaque, and she was concealed and 
shapeless from the neck down. Now 
it was Art’s turn to shiver slightly, 
and his shivering was not caused 
entirely by the cold. Unwholesome 
thoughts had come unbidden to his 
mind. He controlled himself, how- 
ever and, like a gentleman, looked 
away. 

Just as he thought he had the 
temptation to repression really 
squelched it popped up again with 
a new ploy. The poor girl was still 
shivering, wasn’t she? He should do 
what he could to help, right? 
“Want my trousers?” he asked. It 
was incidental, he told himself, it 
was not important in this 
emergency, that removing the 
trousers would mean taking off the 
codpiece too and this would mean 
stripping his detumescent body of 
his proper sexual emphasis. 

She appeared not to find any- 
thing wrong or suggestive of subli- 
mation in his offer, but declined it 
all the same. “No, this is fine, 
thank you. You’ve been a wonder- 
ful help. I hope I can repay you 
some day.” 

He slew a mosquito on his bare 
shoulder. The river before them 
was beginning to reproduce a sun- 
set. Around them on the riverbank 
a number of the other stranded 
passengers had also paired off and 
were embracing or resting between 
embraces. The presence of these 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



25 




others made real impropriety un- 
thinkable and helped Art put temp- 
tations from his mind. 

There were more boats in the 
river now, police or other official 
craft of some kind, and their 
searchlights were beginning to play 
over the far bank. Groups of people 
were still moving around over 
there. They had improvised 
banners to carry, and rhythmic 
chants to sing. From where Art sat 
on the eastern bank the words of 
neither song nor sign could be dis- 
tinguished, but the powerful tones 
of the chanting carried across the 
water. 

Ill 

AS THE train began to slow for the 
Chicago terminal, Rosamond 
leaned across the seat arm and 
snuggled once more against Art’s 
shoulder, while one of her hands, 
like some small animal seeking 
shelter, strayed inside his tattered 
shirt. “Art, are you sure you can’t 
take the time to meet Daddy to- 
night? 1 know he’s going to want to 
thank you for helping me.’’ 

“I wish I could, but I’m really 
anxious to catch up with my 
family.” Of course he hadn’t told 
her why he was trying to catch up 
with them. He glanced at his 
watch; it was nearly midnight. 
"Some other time.” 

“You be sure and call us while 
you’re in Chicago. 1 mean it.” She 
dug out a pencil and a piece of 



paper from the pouch attached to 
the seatback in front of her, and 
scribbed a number, using the top of 
the picnic cooler as a desk. When 
he touched the plastic top, in reach- 
ing to pick up the paper, it felt at 
least as cold as ice. Like her eye- 
frames, the cooler was perhaps 
more expensive than it had seemed 
at first sight; whatever picnic rem- 
nants were inside were probably 
frozen solid. 

As he emerged from the tube car 
into a vast cheerful cave of ceramic 
tile and warm light. Art looked 
around to wave goodbye to Rose, 
and caught only a glimpse of her in 
the crowd, being met and wel- 
comed by a couple of men. Strange 
girl. But he forgot about her 
quickly in heading for a huge elec- 
tronic display describing the city's 
public transportation system. 

It was late enough for the traffic 
to be light, and the taxi he had 
chosen as the probable fastest 
means of transport made good 
speed through the well-illuminated 
streets. Still Art shifted restlessly in 
his seat, and pulled at his beard im- 
patiently. He had the feeling that 
minutes counted, that even now 
Rita might be taking some irre- 
traceable step toward an illegal 
parturition. The feeling was no 
doubt irrational; any actual birth 
would have to be months away, of 
course. But there was some kind of 
federal law against even conspiring 
to commit an illegal parturition. 
Midwifery, as the news media

usually called it. Art didn’t know 
exactly how far one could go with- 
out running afoul of the law. He 
didn't know exactly what the law 
said. It was one of those things he 
hadn’t wanted to learn about, 
probably because all along he had 
been subconsciously afraid that 
someday it would menace him and 
Rita. 

How could she do such a thing, 
get them into this kind of trouble? 
In her note she had said that she 
still loved him. She had used the 
word twice. But now he was being 
rhetorical with himself; he knew his 
wife, and she was perfectly capable 
of doing this thing, loving him or 
not. 

While waiting for a traffic signal 
to change the cab driver turned in 
his seat and glanced back at Art 
through the bullet-proof partition, 
fhrough the intercom speaker the 
driver’s voice asked: "Someone 
meeting you?” 

“Yes.” Art stretched the truth. 
"At the block entrance. It’s a block 
of townhouses.” 

The cabbie faced forward again 
without answering. Art had just 
killed his hopes of collecting an 
easy bodyguard fee, in what the 
cabbie must know was a good 
neighborhood. 

They were moving again. Now 
the building walls that had lined 
both sides of the street fell back. 
The cab was entering a section of 
the city that had a look of newness, 
of having recently been rebuilt.

Under new streetlamps that closely 
simulated daylight, tall elms warm- 
ed their fine June leaves. On each 
side of the wide, gently curving 
boulevard were new-looking stone 
walls, smooth enough to be unscale- 
able but still with enough irregu- 
larities in their texture and color 
and shape to give them almost the 
look of natural formations. The 
walls were windowless, two or three 
stories high, and Art knew that 
they enclosed townhouse blocks, 
about the size of the old city blocks 
they had replaced. The pedestrian 
entrances, never more than one on 
a side, were narrow-mouthed and 
well-lighted; inside each entrance. 
Art supposed, there would be a se- 
curity guard in a protected booth. 
Vehicle ramps curved down from 
the street to enter a subterranean 
level of each block. 

The cab stopped in front of one 
such entrance, and Art put money 
into the slot in the partition, got 
back his change, and disembarked. 
He walked right into the bright 
rocky tunnel of the entry, through 
block walls that looked as thick as 
those of some ancient castle — or 
cave, perhaps, where the first men 
had sheltered from the terrors of 
the night they could not under- 
stand. 

He came quickly to a place where 
the bright-lit narrow passage was 
blocked by a gate of steel grillwork, 
heavily functional despite its orna- 
mentation of nymphs and cupids. 
In a booth built into the wall beside 



the gate sat a gray-uniformed man 
who looked out at Art through a 
small window of bulletproof glass. 
Through the window Art could see 
that this guard had before him rows 
of buttons, and closed -circuit TV 
monitors, and a pistol within easy 
reach. The guard was eyeing Art 
with alert suspicion, no doubt 
sharpened by the lateness of the 
hour. 

“1 want to visit George Parr,” 
Art said. “Tell him Art Rodney is 
out here.” He checked the time on 
his w atch and began to wait. 

Less than three minutes passed 
before George came into view be- 
yond the iron gate, which slid open 
at his arrival. He was smiling and 
holding out his big-knuckled hand. 
Aside from the callus pads over the 
base knuckles of forefinger and 
middle finger, there was nothing 
peculiar in the feel of George’s 
hand, lethal weapon though it was 
supposed to be. And George was 
rather short. Sturdy, but not bulg- 
ing or rippling with muscle inside 
his transparent shirt. His pale hair, 
almost the color of Rita’s, was 
crcw-cut to the same length as his 
neat goatee. 

“How’s it going. Art?” George 
didn’t look upset about anything, 
but then Art could not recall that 
he ever had. 

"Well, I’m upset, naturally. 1 
want to talk to Rita right away.” 

“She’s been here, but now she’s 
gone again.” 

“What?” 



28 



GALAXY 




“That’s right. Come in.” With 
gentle pressure on an arm George 
steered him through the gate. 
.Speaking to the microphone below 
the guard’s window, George added: 
“My brother-in-law. He’s going to 
be staying with us for a day or so.” 
Art let himself be steered inside, 
though he wasn’t at all sure about 
the duration of his stay. “Where is 
she now?” he asked impatiently. 
“Couldn’t y'OM have talked to her?” 
George simply continued to smile 
in his likable way. “Come on in and 
have a look at our new home. We 
can talk the whole situation over. 
It’s not something that can be 
settled in a couple of words. Ann’s 
fixing up a bed for you.” 

ALL RIGHT.” Art sighed, aban- 
doning whatever hope he 
had left of somehow catching up 
with Rita tonight. Let Ann fix the 
bed. He was willing to bet she 
would never -offer to share it with 
him, which was fine with Art. He 
would make polite gestures of lust 
at her. whether or not she had the 
good manners to reciprocate, but in 
(iTith she aroused him not at all. 

Another few meters of tunnel 
and they had reached the interior of 
the block. It looked just about as 
Art had expected, but still he was 
impressed. Most of the interior was 
a single open space, wide and 
pleasant, green now with summer 
grass and trees and shrubs. This 
central park was mostly in darkness 



now, but was surrounded by the 
lighted windows and patios of the 
block’s thirty or so townhouses, 
which were all backed against the 
block’s encircling outer wall and 
were probably integral with it. 

Shaded lights on knee-high poles 
gently illuminated curved paths of 
flagstone paving that branched off 
into the balmy night in several 
directions. Crickets sang of 
summer and tranquility. In spite of 
his worries Art found himself 
pausing, soothed by the peaceful 
scene. He said: “It looks like you 
have things nice in here.” 

George pounced gratefully on 
this retreat to banality. “1 tell you, 
it makes me feel a lot easier about 
the kids. There’s even talk about 
getting our own elementary school 
started right here in the block.” He 
gestured the direction for Art to 
take and they walked on. Some- 
where nearby, people playing string 
instruments were rehearsing a 
melody, starting and stopping and 
trying again. Somewhere else a wild 
party was in progress, but its up- 
roar came heavily muted from some 
deep interior place, and to the 
musicians inside their own house it 
must be entirely inaudible. 

“Yes, very nice,” said Art, 
following where George led. 

“We have our own emergency 
power generator, too,” said 
George. “In case vandals knock out 
the city power or there’s a break- 
down. That’s happened a couple of 
times in the last year.”

“Good idea.” Art’s sandals 
scraped on the slight unevenness of 
the flagstones as they walked a 
pleasant curve between the houses’ 
vine- and bush-screened patios and 
the openness of the central park. 
Each house was surprisingly private 
behind its trellises or open-work 
wall or vines. Art wondered if Rita 
might be sheltering at this moment 
in one of these discreet dwellings, 
hidden by friendly conspiratorial 
neighbors until Ann could throw 
the persecuting husband off the 
track with some halfway plausible 
story. “Yes, this is a beautiful 
place.” 

“Costs an arm and a leg and a 
testicle too,” said George, his voice 
now turning grim. “1 don’t think 
there’s a man in the block who 
doesn’t have a job — 1 mean a good 
job — or his own business. In fact 
I’m repressin’ sure there isn’t.” 
Talking man-to-man, George 
would sometimes use strong langu- 
age. In front of ladies. Art had 
noticed, he never did. 

“How are things at the dojo?” 
Art asked. Then he turned his head 
at the unexpected sound of a 
splash, followed by a trill of femi- 
nine laughter. Way out in the 
middle of the common park the 
lights of a swimming pool glowed in 
the soft, safe darkness, and he saw 
the wet tan gleam of a bikinied 
body. What were possibly the lights 
of another pool were almost com- 
pletely blocked off by intervening 
shrubbery. 



“Oh, good enough, I guess,” 
said George. “Here’s our happy 
home.” He walked behind a vine- 
covered trellis to a patio. Ann, as if 
she might have heard them coming, 
was peering out with a hospitable 
smile from her doorway of white 
stone and Spanish-looking iron- 
work. Stalking across the Parrs’ 
hedged-in patio on thin metal legs, 
a kneehigh electric bugkiller lured 
flying creatures to itself with a ner- 
vously flickering eye of yellow light 
and a whisper of attractive noises. 
It broke its whispering with 
zapping hiccoughs as some of its 
larger victims were ingested. 

As Art had expected, Ann’s dress 
was radical. Her skirt fell almost to 
her knees, and her blouse almost 
completely covered her breasts and 
left only a narrow strip of midriff 
bare. Both garments were loose- 
fitting and practically opaque. Also 
as he had expected, Ann’s chin was 
lifted high in challenge despite her 
smile; she would be glad to have 
him stay in her house for a day or so 
and argue; maybe she would be 
able to convert him. Her face was 
reasonably pretty, and her hair a 
curly brown. She was small and 
strong, like George, and her 
strength was even more subtle than 
his. 

“Rita thought you might come 
after her. Art,” she greeted him. 
“You didn’t bring a bag? That’s all 
right, there’s a clothing vendor 
right here in the block. Of course 
you’re staying with us, we have a

spare room now. My brother was 
here for a couple of days, but he 
moved out when Rita showed up.” 
Ann shrugged away her sibling’s 
behavior. 

“Fred’s here in Chicago too?” 
“Yes. The day he finished high 
school he just had to apply for 
Basic Income, like a fool. Couldn’t 
see going to college, or even trying 
to go. He wants George to give him 
a job, or so he says. Come and see 
your children, they’re asleep.” 

I NSIDE the townhouse the furnish- 
ings were rather sparse and dis- 
orderly, indicating that the Parrs 
were not yet done with the job. Evi- 
dently they had barely had time to 
unpack in their new house before a 
series of their crazy relatives began 
to arrive from California. Following 
Ann to some ascending stairs. Art 
noted an electric fireplace in the 
living room, where the floor looked 
like real hardwood. He could well 
believe that only the prosperous 
lived in this block. 

After gesturing for silence in a 
second-floor hallway, Ann slid 
open a door. Art went in to find 
Timmy and Paula curled in their 
usual positions in the strange bed, 
child-bodies clothed in opaque pa- 
jamas like unopened flower buds 
all sheathed in leaves. Across the 
room in another bed were two small 
mounds that would be George Jr. 
and his younger brother Enoch. On 
the wall Art noticed a version of 



what he recognized as a traditional 
Christfan statuette, depicting the 
putative founder of the sect fasten- 
ed to a wooden cross. The figure 
was quite large for the little room, 
and crudely but strongly carved in 
some pale wood. He wondered if 
Fred might have done it. 

“Don’t wake them,” Ann 
whispered, as Art bent over his own 
two children. “They’re worn out 
from traveling.” 

Art, who had not intended to 
touch them and risk an awakening, 
now gave each a kiss. They were not 
as deeply asleep as he had thought, 
for Paula reached up to tangle baby 
fingers in his beard. Then, as if re- 
assured, she slept again. Tim, 
almost three years older, murmur- 
ed: “Daddy.” 

“Go to sleep,” Daddy whispered. 
And Tim did so, for once. 

Art walked downstairs again 
with Ann. “So,” he commented, 
“Rita’s gone into hiding some- 
where. How long does she expect 
the children to stay here?” 

“Art, you know we don’t mind 
having them in the least. Husband 
George, where are you?” 

“That wasn’t what 1 asked.” 
“Black Russian?” asked George 
from below, appearing in the door- 
way of what was evidently the recre- 
ation room, holding a couple of 
plastic bottles in his hands. 

“Thanks, I will,” Art answered. 
Inside the rec room was a bar, and 
a second fireplace, with a tag mark- 
ed INSTRUCTIONS Still hanging

from one andiron. Art sank down 
with a sigh upon a leather-like 
couch, and received from George, a 
glass with ice cubes floating in a 
dark and powerful fluid. 

Ann had vanished, apparently to 
the kitchen, for there drifted in 
sounds suggesting the preparation 
of food. From out there somewhere 
she called: “How do you like our 
medieval fortress? I’m very happy 
with it. The kids have a safe place 
now.” 

“It’s very nice,” Art called back, 
downing his first swallow of Black 
Russian. “1 think I saw two swim- 
ming pools, didn’t 1?” 

In a chair opposite the sofa 
George sat, or squatted, pulling up 
his sandalled feet and folding his 
legs in an effortless contortion. 
“The pool in the bushes is more 
Ann’s than anybody else’s. She’s al- 
ways wanted a nude pool available, 
and when the blockhouse corpora- 
tion was being formed she kept 
standing up in meetings and de- 
manding.” 

“Well, why shouldn’t I?” Ann, 
smiling, was in the doorway, al- 
ready pushing a serving cart laden 
with sandwiches and cups of soup. 
Had she been expecting Art? “You 
know me. Art.” 

He thought he did. While 
moving clutter from a small table to 
make room for some food. Art got a 
good look at the covers of some of 
Ann’s radical magazines. The cover 
photos featured startlingly shroud- 
ed bodies, and bold print promised 



that the articles inside were of 
shocking frankness, detailing what 
every adult ought to know about 
the history of celibacy and the 
ancient, once-honorable techniques 
of self-control. Art took these to be 
the kind of magazines that promis- 
ed more in the way of obscenity 
than they usually delivered. He 
would have expected a more sophis- 
ticated obscenity than this on Ann’s 
coffee table. He thought that she 
was watching for his reaction to the 
magazines, and he tried to show 
none at all. Maybe they were just 
left there as argument pieces. 

Art didn’t much like the idea of 
his children staying here, but where 
else was he going to put them while 
he searched for Rita? And they 
were too young, he supposed, to be 
much affected by Ann’s morals — or 
lack thereof. He liked to think of 
himself as fairly liberal, but this 
woman just had a dirty mind. It 
was as simple as that. He could 
imagine being marooned in a long 
orbit with her, and her wearing 
long opaque coveralls continuously, 
and refusing sex through all the 
months and years. 

He had thought he was conjuring 
up that image as a private expres- 
sion of his scorn, but somewhere in 
its ugly heart a kernel of attraction 
lay, which made Art angry when he 
realized it. Repulsive woman! He 
could feel sorry for George, who 
was a gentleman, except that 
George must have known what 
kind of woman he was marrying 



32

and George still seemed very well 
satisfied. George in his own quiet 
way was evidently pretty far out 
himself. 

“You know, old girl,” said 
George, the squatting guru, “your 
ways are actually more old-fashion- 
ed than your opponents’ are. You 
go back to the twentieth century. 
Or was it the nineteenth when 
everybody pretended to be chaste?” 
Ann took a seat on the sofa next 
to Art and gave him a look in- 
tended to show comic exasperation 
with her husband. “I’m hungry, 
let’s eat,” she said. “Oh, George, 
you know it’s not what’s new or 
what’s old-fashioned. I know things 
go in cycles. It’s not whether people 
wear suits when they swim or don’t 
wear them, it’s why they wear them 
or go without.” 

“Ann.” Art set down his glass, 
which had somehow become 
empty. “Ann, where is Rita? 
Where did you send her?” 

“Art, listen to me. I’m not going 
to tell you where she is, because I 
don’t know.” 

“Don’t know? Come on. When is 
she coming back to get the chil- 
dren? As soon as 1 leave?” 

Ann, with maddening assurance, 
ignored the question. “Art, I 
suppose you realize that she’s ex- 
pecting the people at Family 
Planning to make trouble for her.” 
“Of course 1 know she’s in 
Family Planning trouble. Why do 
you imagine I’m here?” If he 
hadn’t had the drink he would be 



shouting at Ann by now. “She left 
me a note, I know she’s pregnant. I 
even had a call from the FP before I 
left California.” He repeated as 
well as he could the few words of 
Ms. Lazenby’s message. 

ANN listened in sympathy and in- 
dignation, as if the FP agents 
had broken down Art’s door. 
“Well, if and when our third one 
comes along — I take my pills and 
pray it never does, but if and 
when — I’m going to do just what 
Rita’s doing. No court or no doctor 
is going to murder one of mine, I 
don’t care what the laws say.” 
“You have that right,” affirmed 
George in a low voice. 

She flashed her eyes over at her 
husband, glad of support though 
not needing it, and plunged on. 
“And no one’s going to make me 
call it unwanted, either, not once I 
know that it’s alive!” 

Drink or not. Art’s nerves were 
worn and his voice got louder. 
“Most people would say that you 
yourself have rather a murderous 
attitude toward the wanted people 
of the world . The ones who are alive 
right now, including the babies. 
You’re talking about adding to the 
crowding. Remember Calcutta. 
Remember Rio. Where will this 
year’s cannibalism be?” 

George had begun on a cup of 
soup with apparent good appetite. 
Now he reached in between the dis- 
putants for some crackers. “Peace, 
brethren, peace, sistern,” he said.

33 




smiling genuinely. “Art, how was 
your trip?” 

“Oh, exciting.” Art sat back. and 
took an interest in his own soup. 
Arguing general principles with 
Ann was certain to wear him out 
and get him nowhere. Let the at- 
mosphere cool off for a minute and 
then he would return to the subject 
of his wife. He began to tell the 
Parrs of his adventures. 

The attack on the Christian 
monastery was naturally a shock to 
Ann, and he let her see the real 
sympathy he felt for any victims of 
persecution. “I suppose we passen- 
gers should have stopped and de- 
manded that the police do some- 
thing for that man who was scream- 
ing in the woods — but they were 
only Transcon’s private police, and 
I suppose they had their orders, as 
they said.” 

Ann looked at him wanly, mysti- 
fied. “But why was the monastery 
being attacked?” 

“One of the people there said 
something about the monks’ per- 
forming experiments on some 
aborted fetuses. Some absurd, 
muddled story about creating mon- 
sters. Of course a lot of scientists 
work with fetuses.” Ann for some 
reason seemed shocked, perhaps 
even frightened; she was sitting 
quite still and listening intently. 
Art went on: “It does strike me as 
rather inconsistent for these 
monks, who are presumably as op- 
posed to abortion as you are, to use 
fetuses that are still biologically 



active in their experiments, what- 
ever research they’re really doing. 
Of course that’s no excuse for vio- 
lence, for mob action.” 

Ann and George exchanged a 
look. Then she brought her atten- 
tion back to Art. “Who was this 
girl you said you helped?” 

“Oh, her name was Rose some- 
thing or other, lived in Chicago. 
She was really frightened, for which 
1 don’t blame her.” 

Ann was upset. “There doesn’t 
seem to be any safety for anyone 
any more. I’m glad we’ve got this 
place. Art. you and Rita should 
think about getting into a town- 
house like this. I don’t think 
California is any safer to live in 
than Illinois.” 

“I’m sure we have a lot of prob- 
lems out there, too. I’ll talk over 
our housing situation with Rita 
after I’ve found her again. Now tell 
me where she is.” 

His voice was not threatening but 
it was grim and determined enough 
to shake Ann back into her anger 
mode again. Her eyes brightened 
and her chin lifted. But before she 
could speak George put out a per- 
emptory hand and got to his feet 
with a neat quick untangling of his 
legs. “Ann,” was all he said, but to 
Art’s surprise, she closed her 
mouth. 

George set down the empty soup 
cup that he had been turning round 
and round in his fingers for some 
time. “Art, I’m satisfied that Rita’s 
in good hands.” 



34

“Then you know where she is. If 
you know, you’re going to tell me.” 
“Let me finish. Let’s say that I 
know my sister. I believe she knows 
what she’s doing. Isn’t that 
enough?” 

“Not for me.” Art was inflexible. 
“You knew she was trying to do 
something wrong, and dangerous, 
and maybe you could have stopped 
her but you didn’t try.” 

There was a pause that seemed 
long. Ann, evidently still consider- 
ing herself commanded to silence, 
was biting her tongue. Her hus- 
band still held the floor, dominat- 
ing the room without effort, uncon- 
sciously rubbing his enlarged 
knuckles. “1 know it’s dangerous,” 
George said unhappily. “She could 
go to jail for what she’s doing. But 
she wants to do it. She made a free 
decision.” 

“What about me?” Art demand- 
ed. “Don’t 1 have any say about 
how many children I have?” 

Ann’s headshake snapped a de- 
cisive No. “Not if it means killing.” 
"Killing? How can you call an 
abortion — ?” But it was no use. 
Lven if it had been desirable to 
argue with Ann, he could have 
found no words. Ann’s reality was 
so far from the commonly accepted 
view that there seemed to be no 
place to start. At least Art could 
not find the place, not after mid- 
night, not after a day of wife-chas- 
ing and strain and rioting and 
Black Russians. Somewhere along 
the line George had refilled his 



glass and by now it was half empty 
again. “1 wish we could forget 
about our differences,” Art went 
on, lowering his voice. “Rita’s wel- 
fare is the only thing I’m worried 
about right now. All else is secon- 
dary.” 

“We know that,” said Ann with 
impulsive honest sympathy. 

“Eventually I’ll find her,” Art 
insisted. “You know I’m going to 
bring her home. You think I’ll just 
let her drop out of my life for six or 
seven months? And what about the 
children, are they going to stay here 
for that length of time? Timmy 
should be starting kindergarten . 
it’s an insane scheme and I won’t 
allow it. In any case Family 
Planning will put a stop to it if I 
don’t. Don’t you suppose they can 
quickly track her down? Isn’t there 
a law against conspiracy to commit 
parturition, that they could prose- 
cute her under already?” 

“Not without more evidence than 
her dropping out of sight for a few 
days,” Ann said quickly. “Not 
without a lot more evidence than 
that.” 

“For a few days? I don’t under- 
stand. What does she hope to ac- 
complish by doing that?” 

Ann fell silent again. George 
waved a hand and seemed about to 
speak, but then only sat down 
again and stared into his new fire- 
place. 

“Will somebody tell me, please?” 

“You see,” Ann began slowly, 
“once nine months have passed

since conception, no doctor is 
allowed to put the baby to death for 
any reason, without the direct peti- 
tion of the mother or other surviv- 
ing next of kin. The Supreme Court 
was very clear on that several de- 
cades ago, and the decision still 
stands. And what does a conspiracy 
indictment matter to a mother who 
can save her baby’s life?” 

Baby? Oh, of course, she was 
talking about the fetus. Art was no 
longer sure that anything being 
said made sense. It was well after 
midnight, and they must all be 
tired. He was, certainly. Eros, but 
Rita too must be tired this mid- 
night, wherever she might be. 

Ann said: “Art, your room is 
ready. Whenever you want to go 
up.” 

“In the morning, then,” Art told 
her. “But never doubt that I’m 
going to find her and take her 
home.” 

IV 

F red Lohmann woke up with 
someone’s smooth arm thrown 
across his bare chest and someone’s 
delicate breath snoring gently in his 
left ear. Where was he? Oh yes, the 
YPPC hotel, in Chicago. Yesterday 
he had checked out of the Parrs’ 
plush new house, more or less 
urged on by his sister Ann, and 
anyway not anxious to get himself 
involved in whatever had brought 
Rita Rodney in weeping from Cali- 
fornia. Rita had looked pregnant. 



far enough along to show a little. 
Say, didn’t the Rodneys have two 
kids already? 

Anyway, all that was none of 
Fred’s affair. He had big problems 
of his own, and important events 
were scheduled for today. First of 
all, this morning Fred as a newly 
independent and adult citizen was 
going to collect his first Basic 
Income check from Uncle Sam, the 
check covering the month that had 
passed since his graduation from 
high school in California. And that 
first B1 check might well be his last; 
he sublimatin’ well hoped it would 
be anyway, for this afternoon he 
was going to have a real workout 
with George and if things went well 
at the dojo he might be a jobholder 
by tomorrow. And that would prove 
a lot of people wrong. 

Now, what about this sleeping 
arm that weighed so gently on his 
breathing? In a moment he remem- 
bered, her name was Marjorie. She 
too was a newcomer to Chicago, 
looking for a job, and last night the 
desk clerk at the Y had assigned 
her and Fred to sleep together. The 
atmosphere at the Young Persons’ 
Play Club was certainly different 
from what it was at the Parrs’. Ann 
and George might get a chuckle out 
of it when he told them. Behind the 
front desk in the lobby was a big 
sign on the wall reading pure 

THOUGHTS ARE THE MARK OF A 
DIRTY MIND. And they weren’t try- 
ing to be funny, either, they were 
really that old-fashioned here. They 



36 



GALAXY 




had a strict house rule requiring at 
least two people in every bed. Mar- 
jorie, though she herself was by all 
indications a conservative, well- 
brought-up, lascivious girl, had 
agreed with Fred last night that the 
sign was funny, and they had 
shared a little laugh about it. She 
was a good sex partner, too, so 
things had worked out all right. He 
might have been paired with some- 
one a lot less congenial. 

Fred disentangled himself from 
Marjorie’s naked body and got out 
of bed without awakening her. The 
bed folded down on both sides of 
the wall that separated his tiny 
loom from hers. Ingenious, Fred 
thought. When the bed was raised 
it completed the wall and the rooms 
were separated, allowing either 
party to have privacy for business 
or social reasons, A hole was 
created through the wall, connect- 
ing the rooms, whenever the bed 
was lowered for use. Last night 
Fred had discovered that the bed 
mechanism made it impossible to 
raise or lower either side inde- 
pendently; if you wanted to lie 
down, you had better be ready for 
sex, or at least a polite attempt at 
sex, with your appointed partner. 

( Jeorge was going to have a good 
laugh when Fred told him. Except 
George seemed to have a lot on his 
mind just lately. 

After a quick visit to the alcove 
that held his toilet and shower, 
Fred came back to the center of his 
small room, studied his tall. 



muscular body in the wall mirror, 
and did a few light exercises, just 
loosening and testing a little, mak- 
ing sure the knee and elbow joints 
moved freely and with plenty of 
snap. He tensed his corrugated 
belly muscles and snapped his 
rocklike fist at his solar plexus, 
leaving a small red mark. He told 
himself he looked older than eigh- 
teen; the beard was coming along 
okay. But he hadn’t really worked 
out in more than a week, and 
though he tried not to admit it to 
himself he was scared by the 
thought of this afternoon’s pending 
test with George. 

Would George take his word for 
it that he really had a brown belt 
ranking, or might George call 
California to check, and catch him 
in a lie? The idea was to do really 
well in the workout, show George 
some real good moves, and he 
wouldn’t bother to check up. He 
would hand Fred a brown belt to 
wear and put him to work instruct- 
ing novices. Meanwhile he would 
work out all he could, and in a few 
months start to think about moving 
up to black . 

Marjorie stirred in her sleep and 
seemed on the point of waking up, 
and Fred hastened to get his cod- 
piece and shorts from the chair and 
put them on. She seemed like a nice 
girl, and so Fred was treating her 
with respect; he wouldn’t want to 
display to her his unmannerly 
shriveled lack of arousal on this 
nervous morning.

... all the same, though, you 
never knew. Some guys who had 
been around said that the nice girls 
like this one could really be the 
coldest chillers once they let them- 
selves go. Looking down now at 
Marjorie’s still-sleeping form, Fred 
could easily imagine it covered, 
blurred into sexlessness. Her figure 
was almost boyish in repose, with- 
out the padded bra that she had 
thrown off last night, and it was 
years since he had felt any lust for 
boys. He could picture her eyes 
opening, their clear and penetrat- 
ing gaze (so he imagined; last night 
he had not noticed) pushing lust 
aside, piercing through his hard 
male body, seeking to touch 
him . 



F red gave himself a mental kick 
and looked away. Not that he 
felt guilty. Twins, every normal guy 
had thoughts about chastity and 
sublimation, and enjoyed them, 
too. It was just that today Fred 
didn’t want to get himself into a 
difficult emotional state. 

Still it was impossible not to 
notice how childlike Marjorie 
looked in her sleep. In his imagina- 
tion he found himself putting a 
long, snowy, opaque gown around 
her ... he kicked himself again, 
and went on getting dressed. 

She woke up, turning and 
stretching, before he was ready to 
leave. He looked around at her and 
swallowed hard, for suddenly the 



clear-eyed gaze he had imagined 
was quite real. 

“Good morning — Margie. You 
don’t mind if 1 call you by your first 
name?” He had forgotten what her 
last name was. 

“No, 1 don’t mind. Uh . .” 

“Fred, Fred Lohmann.” 

“Yes, certainly, Fred.” She 
rolled over onto her back and gave 
a routine wiggle of her hips. “Burn- 
ing with lust this morning, that’s 
me.” But her tone made the invita- 
tion no more than a polite form. 

“Me too.” His tone was even 
more casual than hers. “Too bad, 
but 1 gotta get an early start on 
some business today.” 

Her eyes seemed to chill, sending 
something like a sensation of real 
cold along his back. She murmured 
softly: “What is a poor girl going to 
do, when the man she’s with says he 
just won’t screw?” The verse from 
which the line came was latrine 
doggerel, ancient and more than 
mildly dirty. 

If Fred had ever heard encour- 
agement, this was it. Even Basic 
Income and karate could wait. 
“Well, then, how about it, girly?” 
he asked boldly. “How about you 
and me just frosting things a few 
degrees?” 

He had been too bold too soon. 
“Just don’t rush it,” Marjorie said 
crossly, with a curve of her spine 
becoming all sex again. Who could 
tell anything about women? She 
rolled out of the bed on her side, 
into her own room, where she 



38 



GALAXY 




reached for a transparent robe. 

‘Tm sorry,” Fred muttered, 
bending slightly to look at her 
through the bed-gap in the wall. 
“Don’t get sore.” Sublimation, was 
she going to complain to the man- 
agement now? Would he be thrown 
out? 

Somewhat mollified, she paused 
in the act of raising the bed be- 
tween them. “Just don’t rush 
things, okay?” Her eyes had lost 
their coldness, but at least she was 
smiling. 

“I’ll be around tonight!” Fred 
called through to her. He helped 
her lift the bed-barrier into place, 
and gave his side of it a jovial pat as 
it sealed him off. 

An hour later he had found his 
way to the nearest branch of the 
Social Security office and was 
standing in line. Having no per- 
manent address since leaving 
California, he had arranged to have 
his first Basic Income check held 
lor him in the Social Security data 
bank until he called at an office 
somewhere to pick it up. For what- 
ever reason, a number of other 
people seemed to be making similar 
arrangements. The line was eight 
or ten people long, and not moving 
very fast. 

The jobholders in the office sat 
snugly fortified behind their desks 
and counters and computer con- 
soles. or else walked quickly by, 
giving the impression that they 
were up to something important. 
Chastity, it was just that they had 



some kind of political pull, or 
they’d be the ones standing in line. 
They seemed to have little regard 
for the people they were processing 
so slowly. Fred lit up a small cigar. 

Now the window at the head of 
the line was being closed for some 
reason, and a man came to divide 
the line and lead its fragments to 
different windows. 

“No smoking in here!” he 
snapped at Fred. He was a 
paunchy, waddling man who 
reminded Fred of a particularly un- 
pleasant high school teacher he had 
suffered under only a few months 
ago. “No smoking, I said! Put it 
out at once or you’ll have to leave 
the office.” 

“1 got a right to my check,” Fred 
muttered, but so weakly that it was 
doubtful if the officious man even 
heard him. At the same time Fred 
was crushing out his cigar on the 
sole of his sandal, for he knew very 
well that he was never going to win 
an argument with the paunchy job- 
holder. Not here. Now, if they ever 
met somewhere else . 

Fidgeting and waiting, thinking 
vague and sullen thoughts, Fred 
inched forward with the line. At 
last he reached the window, gave 
his name and federal identity 
number, and held the tips of his 
fingers on a scanner-plate. After a 
few seconds there came a machine- 
gun clacking from a printing device 
beside the clerk who was processing 
Fred, and some official-looking 
papers emerged.

“Well, this is your first check, 
Fred. Do you have a permanent 
address to give us yet?” 

“No. I’m staying at a YPPC 
now.” 

“Address?” 

“It’s here in Chicago. The one on 
North State Street.” 

The clerk made a note with a 
stylus on a computer input plate, 
then pulled more pieces of paper 
from beneath the counter. “Take 
these booklets, Fred, they’ll tell you 
more about your rights and respon- 
sibilities under the Basic Income 
law. If you win more than two hun- 
dred dollars’ prize money in any 
state or national lottery or govern- 
ment-sponsored competition in any 
calendar month, or obtain gainful 
employment, or acquire ownership 
of more than fifty shares of corpo- 
rate stock, you are required to 
notify us so that your Basic In- 
come can be adjusted. There are 
penalties for failing to notify.” 
There was a little more he had to 
listen to. When at last they released 
him by handing over his check — he 
supposed it was enough to scrounge 
along on for a couple of weeks until 
the next one came, if scrounging 
along was your idea of life — he 
hurried from the office, dropping 
the booklets into a trash receptacle 
as he went through the door. He’d 
notify them, all right, as soon as he 
moved up to jobholder. The sooner 
he could tell them that, the better. 

Since he had such a good chance 
for a job, there was no use hoarding 



his money like a miser. Two weeks’ 
scrimp-along money could buy a 
couple of nights of real fun. After 
that . well, nobody starved. 

A kind of gravitational pull was 
leading him onto a particular slide- 
walk, one that would carry him in 
the direction of a run-down neigh- 
borhood he had noticed not far 
from the Y. There he should be 
able to hit a coffeehouse bar or two. 
He could get some lunch there as 
well as anywhere. There was plenty 
of time before he had to meet 
George at the dojo. And Fred want- 
ed to see about getting hold of some 
gladrags, in case it turned out to- 
night that Marjorie was not just 
teasing but was really in a willing 
mood. If you went to the right place 
and asked the right person, a few 
dollars could always buy a pair of 
plastic cloaks, thin, but stiff and 
perfectly opaque, folded together 
into a pocket-sized carton. 

ART AWOKE with a start in the 
Parrs’ guest room bed, looked 
at his watch, and saw that it was a 
little after nine o’clock. He sat up 
blinking. On the barren tile floor in 
one corner of the sparsely furnished 
room lay a pair of men’s translu- 
cent disposable trousers, apparently 
used and ready for the discard. The 
length of one extended leg indi- 
cated that the garment would be 
too big for either him or George. 
Oh yes; Fred Lohmann had been 
staying here, before Rita. Conceiv- 
ably Fred would know something of 



40 



GALAXY 




her present whereabouts, if Art 
could find a ehance to question 
him. Art remembered him as a 
wild-looking adolescent, tall and 
awkward. 

Before retiring Art had bought 
himself some disposable clothing 
from the block’s vending machine, 
and now after a quick shower and 
beard-trim he dressed in fresh 
shorts and shirt. Still only a quarter 
after nine. While buttoning his 
shirt he peeked into the children’s 
room and found the four of them 
still sleeping. Must have been 
.dlowed to stay up late last night, 
playing together. A door chimed 
and very shortly thereafter voices 
drifted up from downstairs, one 
Ann’s, the other belonging to a 
man whom Art did not recognize. 
Standing in the upstairs hall he 
could understand only a stray word 
or two. 

Going down as soon as he had 
finished dressing. Art turned first 
into the kitchen. He was liable to 
feel sick unless he ate something as 
soon as he got up. In the refrig- 
erator he found a cinnamon-flavor- 
ed protein bar, and on the elabo- 
rate new stove he dialed himself 
coffee. Five minutes, while the low 
dialogue continued in another 
room, and he had the indispensable 
minimum of breakfast in his sto- 
mach. Chewing on a toothmint, 
more or less ready to face the 
world. Art walked into the living 
room . 

The low voices stopped. A lean. 



stooped man wearing a conserva- 
tive transparent business jacket 
above his shorts was standing just 
inside a door that had been closed 
last night and which Art now 
realized must provide access to a 
lower-level garage. The man looked 
up at Art with keen interest, or 
perhaps he was only glad of any in- 
terruption. 

Ann, her pretty chin somewhat 
higher than usual, turned with 
arms folded from her stance of con- 
frontation with the visitor. “Art, 
this gentleman claims he’s a Mr. 
Hall. From Family Planning. 
George has gone out.” Her tone 
managed to imply that George, if at 
home, would have beaten this prob- 
ably fraudulent intruder to a pulp, 
and Art was welcome to do the 
same if he liked. 

“My name is Hall, and I am 
from the Family Planning office.” 
The intruder had a determined 
voice, though not angry or flustered 
(Aha. Ann, have you met your 
match at last?), and his eyes were 
sharp. “I take it you’re Mr. 
Rodney?” 

“I am.” 

“1 was hoping to run into you 
here. Our California office has 
asked us to make a routine investi- 
gation into your wife’s case.” 

“Her case? My wife hasn’t 
broken any laws.” 

“That’s fine! Then if you’ll tell 
me where 1 can get in touch with 
her, we can clear all this up 
promptly and with as little 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



41 




inconvenience as possible.” 

The protein bar in Art’s stomach 
had suddenly gone lumpy. He sup- 
posed that criminals must have ter- 
rible chronic digestive problems. 
Or maybe they got used to it. He 
could think of nothing to say to Mr. 
Hall, and just stood there like a 
guilty fool. 

Hall’s determined voice kept 
coming at him. “1 understand you 
didn’t accompany your wife to Chi- 
cago, you followed her here?” 

“1 — yes, what of it?” Surely, 
thought Art, he had the right to re- 
fuse to answer these questions. To 
talk to a lawyer first, at least. But 
once he refused to answer. Hall’s 
suspicions, that possibly were no 
more than suspicions now, would 
surely be confirmed. 

“Mr. Rodney, is there some rea- 
son you don’t want to tell me where 
your wife is at the moment?” 

“1 don’t know where she is.” It 
was Ann’s fault, and George’s, and 
Rita’s too, that he had to conduct 
this argument in ignorance. Their 
fault, not his, if he got them all in 
deeper trouble. Meanwhile he mar- 
veled greatly at how fast the deadly 
pits could open beneath one’s feet 
in the dull corridor of life. 

“You don’t know?” The interro- 
gator’s tone implied that Art must 
be a fool or a knave, or both, to 
hope to get away with such an 
answer. 

Art folded his arms in uncon- 
scious imitation of Ann. “That’s 
right.” 



Mr. Hall glanced toward Ann, 
who with her own arms still folded 
was obviously quite ready for him. 
He appeared to stifle a faint sigh, 
and then turned back to Art. “Mr. 
Rodney, our California office has 
received medical testimony indicat- 
ing that your wife is pregnant for 
the third time.” 

“Yes, I know about that.” 

“We have no record that she’s 
made any appointment with a phy- 
sician to have this pregnancy ter- 
minated. And the first trimester 
must be nearly over.” 

“I, ah, know nothing about 
that.” 

“Well, I’d like you to at least give 
me your opinion on the subject, 
Mr. Rodney. Do you think your 
wife is planning not to have it ter- 
minated normally, to carry it on to 
parturition?” 

There was no way he could admit 
it. “No, I don’t think that,” he had 
to say. Then he had to pause, for a 
nervous, choking swallow. Ann was 
just standing by, letting him 
flounder, confident that they had 
told him no secrets and so there 
were none he could betray. Trip- 
lets, but he hated her at the 
moment. 

When he had his throat under 
control again he said; “I’m sure 
Rita means to have it terminated 
properly, she’s, uh, probably just 
gone away by herself for a few days 
to think things over. You see . 
our psychologist has recommended 
against her being sterilized. After 



42 



GALAXY 




Paula, our youngest, was born, 
Rita had an lUD inserted but her 
body kept expelling it. She always 
takes her pills. I’m sure there was 
just a chemical failure somewhere. 
I’m sure she didn’t plan the preg- 
nancy. Unless it was subcon- 
scious.” There seemed to be stories 
in the newsprints every day about 
apes avoiding prison sentences by 
pleading their subconscious com- 
pulsions. If they could do it, why 
couldn’t she? Lay the groundwork 
for it now. But he was talking too 
much, he had better shut up. 

As soon as he quieted, however. 
Hall was after him again. “Mr. 
Rodney, is it like Rita to go off by 
herself for days at a time? When 
was the last time she made a similar 
disappearance?” 

“I . .” He was cornered. Once 
he started making up a string of 
lies. Hall would have it knotted 
around his neck in no time at all. 
“No, 1 can’t say it’s like her,” he 
said in desperation. “I tell you, I 
don’t know where she is. If I knew 
where she w'as I’d be with her right 
now.” 

Mr. Hall shuffled his feet, which 
were no doubt tired from standing, 
and glanced again at Ann, and 
sighed once more, more openly this 
lime. “Mr. Rodney, will you walk 
me back to my car?” 

“There’s no need for you to do 
that. Art,” Ann put in. 

“All right, Mr. Hall,” Art said, 
since the alternative was to go along 
with Ann’s instructions. 



Ann was not going to argue with 
him, not in the face of the enemy. 
“I’ll have breakfast for you when 
you get back,” she promised, hold- 
ing the door. She gave Art a ritual 
kiss as he went out, but offered no 
kiss or caress to Hall, who in turn 
contented himself with a barely po- 
lite pelvic thrust in her direction. 



AS THEY were walking down the 
/V. stairs to the garage, with no 
one else about. Hall said quietly; 
“Mr. Rodney, I hope you don’t 
think of us at Family Planning as 
out to get your wife. Believe me, 
we’d like to help her; I think she’s a 
woman who can use some help.” 
Art was silent. They emerged at 
the foot of the stair into the garage. 
A variety of vehicles were berthed 
in a series of numbered, gate-pro- 
tected stalls. Other areas were 
marked for delivery vehicles and 
visitors’ parking. At the moment 
there was still nobody else in sight. 

Hall stopped, facing Art. “If I 
can’t get a chance to talk to your 
wife, it’s going to be awfully hard 
for her to stay out of trouble. And 
you yourself can be in trouble if 
you’re deliberately withholding in- 
formation. There is the federal con- 
spiracy law. We may not like the 
world in which all these laws are 
necessary, but it’s the only world we 
have.” 

“I’ve been telling you the truth.” 
“Another thing.” Hall very 
slowly resumed his walk toward the 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



43 




visitor’s parking area. “Giving 
birth is a somewhat risky 
proposition at best — I’m sure you 
realize that, as the father of two 
legitimate children. In some of 
these birth-mills a full-term partu- 
rition, or even a fetiparous one, can 
be downright dangerous, believe 
me." 

This time it was Art who 
stopped, a few slow paces later. 
“Even a what?” 

Hall was silent. He seemed to be 
trying to read Art’s face. 

Art repeated: “Even a what? 
What kind of parturition, live 
birth, is there except full term? Do 
you mean premature?” 

Hall continued his intent gaze at 
the mystified Art for a long mo- 
ment, and then relaxed. “I think 
you and 1 are really on the same 
side in this case, aren’t we, Mr. 
Rodney?” 

“1 want my wife at home with 
me, not getting into trouble. And I 
don’t want the world overcrowded 
with my progeny. I’m willing to re- 
spect the rights of others.” 

“Fine.” Hall was suddenly more 
relaxed and friendly. “Then I’d 
better tell you something you may 
not know about. Just recently there 
has come into use a method for re- 
moving a first-trimester fetus or 
embryo from the womb in such a 
way that it can be kept alive. The 
midwifer usually freezes it — ” 

“Alive?” 

“If you can call it that. Alive in 
potential. It can later be reimplant- 



ed in the woman’s body again, or in 
the body of another woman, or put 
into an artificial womb, and it will 
grow and develop eventually into a 
child. In experiments on animals 
normal young have been produced 
by this method for several decades 
now.” 

“Oh.” 

“You begin to see. Now if we at 
Family Planning seize a frozen 
fetus or embryo, our legal situation 
is tricky, because federal law states 
that if nine months have passed 
since conception, the fetus has be- 
come a child. The law goes back 
several decades to when termina- 
tion of surplus pregnancies was 
first required in this country. Some 
women who were about six months 
or so along claimed that they were 
already in labor when their preg- 
nancies were terminated by FP 
doctors, and there was a lot of fuss. 
The law is really outmoded now, 
but we’re still stuck with it.” 

“I don’t quite see . .” 

“The thing is, we can’t legally 
destroy a frozen fetus unless we can 
prove it’s less than nine months 
old. Calendar age, not stage of de- 
velopment, is the way the law 
reads. We’re trying to get it chang- 
ed, of course. There have been 
several articles lately in the news- 
prints on all this, and stories on 
television. I would have thought 
perhaps you would have heard or 
read something about it.” 

“I’ve been busy,” Art said. “Not 
keeping up much with the news.” 



44 



GALAXY 




Probably it was another example of 
his subconscious avoidance of hear- 
ing or remembering, like the exact 
wording of the federal conspiracy 
law. 

“You see, with just a frozen fetus 
in our hands, we have a purity of a 
lime proving its exact age. Can’t 
even take a tissue sample for prov- 
ing the parenthood, since that 
would constitute damage. If we 
can’t prove it’s a superfluous third, 
and nobody claims it, why then be- 
lieve it or not it has to be regarded 
as an unidentified orphan child. 
Treated as a human being in poten- 
tial, which means taking it to an or- 
phanage. Some of these religious 
and so-called humanist institutions 
will take them right in. They’re 
building artificial wombs at a 
furious pace, without permits of 
course, and they have plenty of 
money and manpower for clandes- 
tine research on freezing and re- 
vival techniques, or so it seems.” 

“Uh-huh.” 

"You may have heard something 
about the riot just recently in Iowa, 
where a Christian monastery was 
destroyed. I understand the ring- 
leaders of the riot are now in jail, as 
they should be. Can’t have people 
taking the law into their own 
hands. But there’ll have to be 
proper legal action against those 
cultists too. Some of their priests 
were out there building cryogenic 
devices and freezing fetuses.” 

Art, without realizing it, had 
started walking again, on newly 



shaky legs. Cultists. He thought of 
the carven image on the wall above 
the children’s beds. He knew Ann. 
He thought of the scream coming 
out of the woods, and he thought of 
Rita. “But then . suppose, as 
you say, that the fetus is thawed 
and put into an artificial womb and 
a child results. What then? Could 
the mother claim it?” 

“Probably not without spending 
a prison term, and undergoing 
sterilization.” Hall was looking at 
his watch. “1 suppose there might 
be all kinds of devious means, 
adoption and so on. But a third live 
birth is still a criminal offense by 
the woman, no matter what subter- 
fuges she employs. I really can’t 
understand the woman who does 
such a thing. Setting aside the legal 
problems, anywhere that she and 
her husband live afterwards, the 
neighbors are going to be able to 
count: one. two, three children. 
You couldn’t very well pretend one 
of them is adopted. There aren’t 
enough adoptable children to even 
match the childless couples who 
want one, let alone go to people 
who have tw'o of their own. So it’ll 
be obvious to all that the parents 
had three kids, and pretty soon that 
third one is going to know that he 
or she is superfluous and unwanted 
by the world. That’s a very cruel 
thing to do to a child, in my estima- 
tion.” 

“Mine, too.” 

“No. I just don’t understand 
these women who go to midwifers.”

Hall had reached his car and now 
he unlocked a door and pulled it 
open. “There’s just one more, thing 
I wanted to mention to you, Mr. 
Rodney. Several times a year we in 
Family Planning get a massive de- 
tailed population forecast for the 
whole world, and for our own areas 
in particular; we get it right from 
the UN computer center. Right 
now the latest forecast is several 
days overdue; the rumor is that it’s 
been delayed for re-checking, be- 
cause it’s a real shocker.” 

“1 suppose so.” 

Hall got into his car, slammed 
the door, and then peered out the 
window. “1 hope 1 can rely on you, 
Mr. Rodney.” 

“Certainly 1 mean to do all 1 
can — ” 

“That’s fine.” With a tiny wave 
and a half-smile, his mind probably 
already at work on his next case, 
Mr. Hall upped his window, faced 
forward, and drove off. - 

— but 1 don’t even know where 
she is. Art stared in silent protest 
after the car already zooming up 
the exit ramp. 

V 

AFTER Hall’s departure. Art 
wandered to an escalator and 
rode it up from the garage, emerg- 
ing just inside one of the block’s 
pedestrian entrances. He was 
jogged partially out of his dazed 
state by Timmy and Paula, who 
ambushed their father as he made 



his way back toward the Parrs’ 
patio. The children were munching 
protein bars w ith which they smear- 
ed his clothes. Overriding his re- 
quests for a delay, they pulled at 
him to get him moving on a tour of 
the block’s central park. He gave 
up and went along. He reassured 
himself that his children were well 
and then tentatively questioned 
them about Mommy. About all he 
could find out was that she had said 
she would come back to get them 
soon. 

The tour got as far as the nude 
pool before its directors deserted to 
join the Parr boys, w'ho were al- 
ready in the water. Art sank down 
on a grassy bank nearby and tried 
to think, now and then waving 
mechanically at his offspring when 
they clamored for his attention. 

There w'ere other distractions 
too. No other men were at the 
pool — probably most of those who 
lived in the block were busy this 
morning, at jobs or tending to their 
investments — but several women 
had come to swim. Ann was ob- 
viously not the only bluenose radi- 
cal in this small community; prob- 
ably people with similar attitudes 
tended to get into the same block- 
house corporation. Anyway these 
women came to the nude pool wear- 
ing long, loose, only dimly translu- 
cent jackets, and they swam as bare 
as babies, without so much as a se- 
quin pasted on to emphasize their 
sex. It was hard to say which was 
the more antierotic, being almost 



46 



GALAXY 




completely covered or completely 
bare. Some of them cast suspicious 
glances at the male stranger, who 
in turn waved at his children to 
show that he had a good reason for 
hanging around, and then frowned 
thoughtfully into space. But only 
his face was truly thoughtful. His 
brain was getting nowhere. 

In half an hour or so the kids 
were ready to do something else, 
and Art walked home with the four 
of them, reminding them to gather 
up their clothes. When he got back 
to the house he found George there, 
and promptly took him aside. 

‘‘George, have you seen her this 
morning or heard from her?” 

“No, Art, 1 swear.” 

“I’ve got to find her. She’s my 
wife and 1 have a right to talk to 
her.” 

George stood there for a while, 
looking glum and uncertain about 
it all. Then he said: “I have to 
agree with that.” 

Emboldened, Art pushed harder. 
“1 don’t want to get you, or any- 
body, into trouble. But if I can’t 
find her I’ll have to go to the police 
and report her missing. It’s that 
important to me.” 

George came to a decision. “All 
right. After lunch you and I will go 
out and see about making con- 
tact.” 

“How about right now?” 

“Just come along and we’ll do it 
my way. After lunch.” 

So a couple of hours later, after 
Art had spent some more time with 



his children, and Ann had fed them 
all some more sandwiches, the two 
men went out and got on the slide- 
walk together, George explaining 
that he didn’t have a car right now, 
what with one expense and 
another. 

After a couple of kilometers’ 
ride. Art saw a vast domed stadium 
looming up ahead of them. At 
about the same time, George came 
up from deep thought to say: 
“Understand, it may take a little 
time to find out exactly where she 
is. There are several people I want 
to talk to about it.” 

“Just so 1 get a chance to see her, 
before she commits any irrevocable 
foolishness. Where are we going 
now?” 

“I expect one of the people will 
be at the ball game today. You just 
stand by and let me talk to him.” 

“All right.” 

Another kilometer and the slide- 
walk, by now fairly thick with 
passengers, deposited them before 
one of the entrances to the stadium. 
George said: “Let’s not forget to 
pick up tickets. A dollar is a 
dollar.” 

They accepted time-stamped 
tickets from the jaws of a machine 
as they passed in through a turn- 
stile. George led Art through caver- 
nous passageways to an outfield 
grandstand, where they emerged 
squinting into the sun. A sizable 
crowd was filling a good proportion 
of the seats. The stadium’s domed 
roof had been opened like a set of 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



47 




gigantic jaws and the people were 
in a good humor under the warm 
sun. 

George chose seats high in the 
rear, and kept looking around him 
at the crowd. “I think I see our 
man,” he said after a minute. “You 
just watch the game, and I’ll go 
talk to him.” George moved away. 

Art watched the game, which 
was just beginning, and the crowd 
as well. The Cubs, the home team, 
took a one-run lead in the first 
inning, and gambling in the grand- 
stand promptly became fierce and 
steady, conducted by arm-waves 
and cryptic shouts. Ushers and 
police ignored the betting; Art 
wasn’t sure whether it was legal 
here or not. There seemed to be no 
bookies, no formal organization, 
and no wagers of more than ten 
dollars, but small money passed 
through hundreds of hands with 
every pitch. One of the busier 
gamblers was the man George had 
engaged in low- voiced talk, who 
seemed able to keep his gaming 
and his conversation going at the 
same time. They were sitting too far 
away for Art to be able to tell if 
George was learning anything. 
Their talk just went on steady. 

So things went until the top of 
the fourth inning, when the Cubs 
blundered thernselves four runs be- 
hind. The emotional climate in the 
stands changed radically with the 
score. The majority of the spec- 
tators, grown men and late adoles- 
cents who wore the gaudy codpieces 



and indefinable look of the jobless, 
lost most of their enthusiasm for 
betting and brooded in sullen 
silence. Here and there a few 
gamblers persisted more energeti- 
cally than ever, jumping and shout- 
ing like fanatics when they won, 
but joyless even then. 

G eorge finished his conversa- 
tion abruptly and stood up, 
motioning to Art that it was time to 
leave. They met on the moving 
ramp going down to street level. A 
number of other men were heading 
restlessly in the same direction, 
taking to the exits early. In the lines 
forming at the exits there was some 
jostling for position, and some 
police were standing by alertly. A 
huge, disheveled man standing in 
the next queue glared across a rail- 
ing at Art and George and mur- 
mured something unpleasant about 
jobholders. In present company Art 
felt secure enough to glare right 
back, until the man decided he was 
getting nowhere and turned away. 

“Three innings, dollar and a 
quarter,” droned the Bureau of 
Sports agent in the booth where Art 
presented his ticket. Art picked up 
the coins that came clattering 
toward him from under the bullet- 
proof glass. Probably watching a 
whole game would be worth three 
seventy- five. He wondered if they 
paid overtime for extra innings. 

As soon as they were clear of the 
stadium crowd, riding a westbound 
slidewalk into a part of the city Art 



48 



GALAXY 




had not visited before, he asked 
eagerly: “Did you find out where 
she is?” 

“We’re on the trail. I told you, 
I’ll have to talk to a couple of 
people.” George, shaking his head, 
turned back to look at the slowly re- 
ceding stadium, its roof-jaws gap- 
ing at the sky. “1 was afraid we 
might have a little riot. It gets bad 
in there sometimes when the home 
team loses.” 

Controlling his impatience. Art 
looked back too. “They can get 
paid now just to sit and watch a 
game and keep out of trouble. Or 
there are a thousand things people 
can do to win prizes. They don’t 
have to be intelligent or educated, 
they can win by bowling or pitching 
horseshoes. Everyone can win a 
prize at something. I don’t know 
what they want.” 

George faced forward again. 
"Did I tell you, I may be going on 
television? Probably not, though, 1 
think 1 blew the audition.” 

“No.” Art was surprised. 

“That’s where I was this morn- 
ing, auditioning. Just a local sta- 
tion. Oh, it’s a real triplet of a 
mess. They have this monstrous 
clumsy machine, made up like a 
woman, for a man to fight. Let’s 
change to the high-speed walk 
here, the next place 1 want to stop 
is way out in a slumburb.” 

At the interchange, the walk they 
had been riding flowed briefly be- 
side an acceleration strip. This 
strip was of viscous plastic that re- 



mained cohesive and hard-surfaced 
though it flowed like water, the cir- 
cular stream of it running thick and 
deep and slow beside the slow slide- 
walk, and thin and fast to match 
speeds with the express. With no 
more balancing than it took to 
mount a stair, the passengers made 
the changeover. Once whizzing 
westward aboard the fast, long-dis- 
tance belt. Art and George sat 
down on the continuous bench that 
moved with their new conveyance. 

“So what about this television 
program?” Art asked, his curiosity 
aroused. 

“It’ll be garbage. They want 
somebody to jump through the air 
like an idiot and scream, and beat 
up this giant woman . There 
could be a good karate program, 
showing how the human mind and 
body can work together. I’d like to 
do a good one someday but I don’t 
suppose they’d ever let me. I guess 
I’ll do this one if they want to hire 
me. 1 can use the money.” 

Art had a sudden realization of 
the obvious: a midwifer was illegal 
and therefore must be expensive. 
Rita hadn’t had much money with 
her. Might she have fallen into the 
hands of some cut-rate quack? 

“George, are you paying for — 
Rita?” 

“I’m contributing something.” 
“Then why must we run all over 
the city to find out where she is? 
Don’t you know?” 

George calmly shook his head. 
For a while they rode through the

warm afternoon without talking. 
The whispering rush of the express 
walk, shaded beneath its plastic 
awning, bore them at highway 
speed through kilometer after kilo- 
meter of the great city. They passed 
industrial blockhouses, and older 
manufacturing parks surrounded 
by grim fences, where machines 
labored night and day for Man, the 
master, repairing and sometimes 
redesigning themselves, only oc- 
casionally requiring any human 
supervision. They passed street 
after street of the two- and three- 
apartment dwellings in which the 
bulk of the city’s people seemed to 
live. Here dwelt the great respect- 
able mass. Here the head of the 
household might work two or three 
days a week, here the family owned 
stocks and bonds enough to bring 
some usable income, here they had 
success from time to time in 
winning prizes. Not really full-time 
jobholders, most of them, but that 
was how they saw themselves. 

Vending centers flowed past, 
public computing terminals, streets 
and parking lots. A school. A park, 
with a young couple naked on the 
grass, bodies locked and working 
toward orgasm. A Church of Eros, 
whose twin towers stood like the 
raised knees of a supine woman, 
flanking the main entrance. A 
superhighway interchange for pri- 
vate surface vehicles, fallen into 
disrepair, with half its lanes closed 
by barricades, grass growing 
through the cracked concrete. 



Nearby, a terminal of the under- 
ground long-distance tube com- 
plex. More two- and three-family 
dwellings, row on row on row. And 
scattered everywhere throughout 
the clean and sunlit city, the forti- 
fied stone walls of blockhouses 
springing up. 

Now Art noticed with part of his 
mind that the buildings rushing 
past were becoming noticeably 
shabbier; they must be approach- 
ing the western border of the city. 
Thinking aloud, he said: “Suppose 
she actually does have a child, pro- 
duces a living child out of this. 
What will we do then? I tell myself 
that if it comes to that we’ll just ig- 
nore what people say, or the looks 
we get from them. I’ll do all 1 can to 
keep the third one from feeling un- 
wanted. But 1 suppose he will.’’ 

“I just don’t know how that 
would work,’’ said George. 

“And Rita. I don’t know if going 
to jail would bother her as much as 
being sterilized.” 

After another little silence 
George said; “I know the thought 
of having that done has scared her 
in the past. Maybe now, though, it 
won’t seem so terrible. She’d never 
have another baby to worry about, 
once this one is taken care of.” 

“If it ever is a baby.” Art felt a 
surge of pity and grief for the un- 
wanted third-to-be, unneeded and 
detested by a world already 
jammed. Fetus, why do you thrust 
with such a mad, blind drive to 
reach the light? Shrink back to

nothing. Go away. There’s nothing 
here in the world for you, that you 
should fight to reach it. But of 
course the seed could only grow 
where it had been planted. 

“George, the Family Planning 
man implied that when some 
women go through this new method 
of extracting the fetus and freezing 
it, then they’re content to have the 
resulting child brought up in an 
orphanage. 1 wonder if that’s what 
Rita has in mind. To me it would 
be worse than having a third child 
with us, to purity with what the 
neighbors say. Do you know what 
she intends? She must have dis- 
cussed some plan with you.’’ 

George shook his head gloomily, 
staring off into the distance. 

“We’d adopt the kid, or some- 
thing. We’d hang onto him. But it 
would be pretty grim, and 1 don’t 
want that kid to ever come into this 
world. You can see how I feel, can’t 
you?” 

“1 can see how you feel, and how 
Rita feels, too. Maybe that’s my 
trouble. 1 see everybody’s point of 
view. Even the kid who isn’t born 
yet.” His eyes flicked at Art and off 
again. “If abortion’s not killing, 
what is it then?” 

Being w'ell rested and in good 
control of himself. Art could now 
have brought out the arguments 
w ith which to demolish this simplis- 
tic point of view. But he had no 
wish to argue with George, and 
anyway arguments were no good for 
changing someone’s mind until 



that mind was ready for change. 

T he city proper was suddenly left 
behind. No official boundary or 
sharp line of demarcation was 
visible, but within the space of a 
few blocks the view changed, as 
what was unmistakably a slumburb 
came rising about the slidewalk like 
a dirty wave. Art was a stranger to 
this part of the Chicago area, but it 
did not look much different from 
some sections of Los Angeles. Here 
were the endless curved rows of 
small houses cheaply built, falling 
apart at the age of twenty or thirty, 
but still occupied. Not only occu- 
pied, but cut and partitioned. 
There would be no steady job- 
holders living here, and not many 
who owned shares of stock or won 
more than an occasional prize. This 
was Basic Income territory. 

A small vending district cluster- 
ed around the terminus of the high 
speed slidewalk. Here all the other 
pedestrian walks were stat, as rigid 
and unmoving as the streets. 
Among the automated vendors a 
couple of huntan-attended estab- 
lishments survived. One of these, a 
small and dingy tavern at the dead 
end of a block, proved to be 
George’s destination. 

The tavern did not look old, but 
was already rundown in appear- 
ance, sharing the neighborhood’s 
general air of defeat. Daylight was 
shut out from the interior, and the 
artificial lighting inside was dim 
but violently colored. As Art’s eyes 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



51 




adjusted he could see obscene 
words scrawled here and there on 
the shabby walls, and concealing 
garments, opaque hip boots and 
overcoats, crudely drawn. All in all. 
Art supposed, a typical BI bar- 
room; not that he had seen many 
such, except in television stories. 
Four or five apathetic male custo- 
mers perched on bar stools. Above 
and behind the bar, the legally re- 
quired police TV eye roosted like a 
robotic vulture, now and then turn- 
ing its glass eye on its scrawny 
metal neck. 

The bartender raised his head, 
sizing up his two new customers, 
and fixed eyes blank as the vul- 
ture’s lens on George, as if deciding 
he was the one who had to be dealt 
with. 

“Couple of short ones,” George 
ordered, resting an elbow on the 
bar. When two small glasses of beer 
had been poured, he asked: “Is 
Alfie around?” 

“Maybe shootin’ pool,” the bar- 
tender grated. There was a back 
room. POOLHALL SI. 00 adm. 

George strolled that way. “I’ll 
just see if he’s there.” 

“That’ll be one dollar, see the 
sign?” 

George just glanced back as he 
strolled. “1 won’t touch a cue.” He 
went on into the poolhall. 

The bartender hesitated briefly, 
then picked up the coins George 
had left on the bar and slouched 
away to tend another customer. 

Art sipped his beer, which for 



some reason tasted quite good. He 
wished he knew how to talk to these 
people and act with them. 
George’s and Rita’s background 
was a middle-class as his own, but 
George had picked up the knack 
somewhere. Maybe in karate, 
though he had mentioned once that 
most of the students and practition- 
ers were not the tough-guy type. 
Couple of short ones. Get tough 
with me and I can break your 
ribs — this last was only implied, of 
course, never verbalized or even 
bluntly stated in so many body-lan- 
guage words. He was just this 
somewhat undersized fellow who 
was not at all intimidated. What 
others read into that was what in- 
timidated them. 

There was a stir in a rear booth 
and a pair of B-girls materialized 
out of the dimness there and came 
flowing forward to the bar. Art felt 
a mild twinge of alarm. The girls’ 
license buttons were prominently 
displayed on their kimonos, but the 
garments were probably longer and 
thicker and more shapeless than 
the letter of the law allowed. The 
woman approached the bar and 
stood there, closer to Art than to 
anyone else. Not that they looked at 
him. Their pale-painted faces were 
averted slightly, their mouths 
pinched in professional haughti- 
ness and cool reserve. Art uncom- 
fortably shifted his stance. 

George stuck his head out of the 
back room. “Not today, girls,” he 
called. “Art, get a beer for Alfie, 



52 



GALAXY 




and get us a booth. We’ll be out in 
a minute.” 

The girls’ faces relaxed into more 
natural scowls and they moved 
away, resuming some private con- 
versation in bored voices. One 
pulled off her kimono to scratch be- 
neath her bikni straps. Art bought 
three more short ones, and carried 
the filled glasses to an empty booth. 

F rom the booth he had a good 
view of the tavern’s huge tele- 
vision stage. For some reason the 
ball game was not being shown; 
maybe the game was already over, 
or there could be rioting at the 
stadium. The barrel-sized image of 
an announcer’s head was reading a 
news story: 

“This afternoon in the General 
Assembly, chief Chinese delegate 
Lu Ti-p’ing accused a neighboring 
government. Southern Pan-Asia, of 
using biological weapons against its 
own — the Southern Pan-Asian — 
people. 

“Lu quoted statistics from 
UNiMED which indicate that deaths 
from uncertain causes have 
reduced the spa population by 
nearly ten per cent during the last 
three months. According to the 
UNIMED report, most of those dying 
have been the elderly and the 
chronically ill. According to the 
Chinese accusation, disproportion- 
ately few of the deaths have oc- 
curred among members of the 
Patriots’ Party, now the ruling 
group in Southern Pan-Asia. 



“Finally the Chinese delegate ex- 
pressed regret that, in his words, 
the SPA government has chosen 
such an inhumane method of trying 
to strengthen itself economically. Is 
this, Lu asked, to be the first step 
on a road of dangerous economic 
aggression?” 

As if on cue the announcer’s 
head was abruptly replaced by that 
of another, equally big, who with a 
tyrannosaur’s smile read hastily 
through a perhaps ill-timed com- 
mercial for a Chicago vending 
chain. The presentation was so in- 
ept that Art assumed this was some 
small local station, maybe the very 
one George had auditioned for. 
Probably there were a hundred of 
them, though. 

Art sipped his beer. The news- 
monger was soon back on stage, 
saying: “Then it was the turn of 
Cao Din That, chief spa delegate, 
to reply.” 

The enlarged head of Cao Din 
That now appeared on the stage of 
the tavern in the Chicago slum- 
burb, where nobody but Art 
seemed to be paying the least atten- 
tion, and his translated words were 
heard, categorically denying all the 
charges leveled against the leaders 
of his suffering country. Possibly 
some foreign government was really 
to blame for the surplus deaths. If 
so, let the aggressors beware, they 
would be found out shortly. In any 
case, UNIMED was overstepping its 
authority by interfering in spa in- 
ternal affairs. 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



53 




The tone of the speech became 
milder. Possibly the deaths were 
the unforeseen side-effect of a new 
insecticide, employed in the desper- 
ate struggle to increase food pro- 
duction. Also to be considered were 
the airborne viruses that had been 
accidentally freed during the recent 
UN police action against the Nile 
Republic; no one knew where those 
viruses might have landed, nor 
would anyone even admit to know- 
ing exactly what they were. The UN 
was to be applauded for its prompt 
action along the Nile, which had 
liquidated some planners of biolo- 
gical war, but still some of the con- 
sequences had been unfortunate. 

“Ah, th’ world’s gone t’ repres- 
sion,” said a colorless little old man 
who must be Alfie, for he arrived at 
that moment with George. Art slid 
over to make room. 

Alfie seized a beer, drank most 
of it, and went on talking. “The 
whole world’s crazy. You know 
what happened the other night? 
Somebody bombed Vic Rizzo’s 
townhouse. It musta been just van- 
dals. They couldn’ta known it was 
his.” 

“That so?” George asked, indif- 
ferently. Art wondered who Vic 
Rizzo might be. After a few more 
social noises had been made, and 
Alfie further supplied with beer, 
George got to the point. 

“Alf, you know the city pretty 
well.” 

“I guess I do.” 

“Then tell me something.” 



George dropped his low voice even 
lower. “Who might a nice girl go to 
see, if she got kind of carried away 
and emotional, and wanted to 
finish an extra baby? She’s got two 
kids now.” 

Alfie gave facial demonstrations 
of thought. “Married?” he asked, 
as if being married or single made 
any difference in the number of 
children a woman was allowed to 
bear. 

“Yes,” said George. 

Alfie glanced at Art, wordlessly 
identified him as the worried hus- 
band, and winked at him. Then ob- 
viously pleased to be consulted, 
Alfie assumed an air of wisdom and 
began to talk. He seldom quite 
finished a sentence, however, and 
his speech was thick with allusions 
to people and places that Art had 
never heard of. Also Alf used a 
number of slang words strange to 
Art, or maybe Art was only 
mis hearing them, because Alfs 
whisper was almost too low to be 
made out. All in all, the disserta- 
tion was perfectly unintelligible. 
George, though, kept on listening 
with apparent satisfaction, now 
and again encouraging Alfie with 
grunts and nods, and ordering 
more beer. 



characters you know,” 
^Art reflected aloud, as he and 
George rode the express slidewalk 
into the east again. Twenty kilo- 
meters or so ahead, near the shore 



54 



GALAXY 




of invisible Lake Michigan and 
farther east than Art had been as 
yet, the unbelievable towers of the 
central city rose. 

George grinned. “Alfie has his 
uses.” 

“1 hope you found out something 
from him. I didn’t. Do you think 
Rita is with one of those people he 
mentioned?” 

George turned to look back into 
slumburb country, a desolate sea of 
rooftops beneath the mid-afternoon 
sun. “1 think Alfie may be on the 
phone to Family Planning right 
now. trying to sell them the infor- 
mation that ypu and 1 were asking 
about midwifers. The man I talked 
to at the ball park may be doing the 
same thing. Family Planning 
knows what Rita’s trying to do, but 
1 want’em to think she doesn’t have 
a midwifer yet. They can’t arrest us 
for asking general questions. All 
I’ve been trying to do so far today is 
put’em off the trail a little.” 

Floundering well off the trail 
himself. Art could find nothing to 
say. 

VI 

ART maintained a somewhat surly 
silence through several slide- 
walk interchanges. He and George 
were deep in the city again, moving 
on a fairly crowded walk that 
angled to the southeast, before he 
spoke again to ask: “Where are we 
going now?” 

“The dojo. Fred’s supposed to be 



there at three-thirty so I can watch 
him work out. And then I have a 
private lesson to give. Come along 
and watch.” 

“Look, George, are you going to 
help me find Rita or aren’t you? If 
you can’t or won’t, just say so. 
Don’t keep stalling me along.” 
George was unperturbed. “Just 
come along to the dojo. I said I’d 
help you and I will.” 

Art puffed out his breath. But he 
went along; somehow George’s 
words carried conviction. 

Under a sign that read parr’s 
KARATE DOJO Fred Lohmann was 
waiting for them, holding up the 
front of a modest building in a 
small middle-class vending district. 
Under one arm Fred was carrying a 
whitish roll of what appeared to be 
clothing. 

“Art, you and Fred remember 
each other, hey?” George unlocked 
the ground-floor door and stepped 
inside, waving on the lights with a 
passage of his hand over the switch- 
plate on the wall. 

Art’s hand was squeezed. “Sure 
we do,” said Fred, clearing his 
throat nervously. He towered over 
the two* older men. “Art, how’s 
your wife and kids?” 

“Oh. fine. I guess you met Rita 
yesterday? Over at George’s 
place?” 

“Yeah, sure, that’s right.” 

It seemed obvious that Fred 
wasn’t in on the midwifery con- 
spiracy, but still some clue to Rita’s 
whereabouts might possibly be

gotten out of him. Later. Right now 
Fred was all nervous anticipation of 
whatever test he had been brought 
here for, and George was present, 
raising his window blinds, checking 
his printout for messages, and in 
general opening up his shop. 

The interior of the dojo was 
mostly one big room, about twenty 
meters square, and two stories 
high, so you could have fitted a very 
small house inside it. The floor was 
of polished wood. In the front, be- 
side the street entrance, an area 
separated by a low partition from 
the big room contained a desk, with 
phoneplate and computer terminal, 
and a few chairs, some of them ar- 
ranged as for spectators. An open 
doorway in the rear led to some 
lockers and. Art supposed, a 
shower. Large flags of the United 
States, the United Nations, and 
Japan were formally and correctly 
displayed together on one wall. The 
general impression was of function- 
al orderliness. 

George and Fred each bowed, 
not deeply or very ceremoniously, 
toward the flags. Then they slipped 
off their sandals and padded back 
toward the locker room, bare feet 
seeming to grip the floor familiarly. 
“Make yourself at home, Art,” 
George called back. 

Art put his own sandals into the 
convenient rack by the front door, 
then wandered about looking the 
place over. The smooth floor was 
not slippery to bare feet. 

Something here reminded him of 



chess. He wondered if it was the 
square arena of polished wood, or 
some faint scent of conflict linger- 
ing in the conditioned air. Glancing 
up, he saw four android fighting 
machines hanging like felons near 
the high ceiling, above the center of 
the open floor. He looked about 
and spotted their control console 
standing near the desk. Feeling a 
technician’s curiosity. Art walked 
over and looked at the controls. 

George and Fred soon emerged 
from the locker room, clad in loose 
whitish trousers and jackets, only 
moderately translucent, and wear- 
ing athletes’ codpieces of hard pro- 
tective plastic. “I guess I just lost 
my own belt someplace,” Fred was 
saying, meanwhile accepting a 
brown belt, an overlong strip of 
tough-looking cloth, from George’s 
hand. 

G eorge looped a black belt 
twice around his own waist 
and knotted it in front, and the two 
of them began to limber up, swing- 
ing their legs like ballet dancers, 
crouching and twisting and stretch- 
ing their bodies to unlikely ex- 
tremes, shaking wrists and ankles 
as if their hands and feet had fallen 
asleep. Art stood watching with 
some interest. 

“Ready?” George asked, after a 
few minutes of this. “Let’s go five- 
time sparring, then.” With nearly 
the full length of the floor clear be- 
hind him, he drew himself up 
facing Fred and they exchanged 



66 



GALAXY 




bows. Then they stood, each with 
arms slightly bent, hanging down 
in front of his body, fists loosely 
closed. “You first,” George 
directed. 

Fred snapped into a tenser, 
much lower stance, poised to at- 
tack, his right fist cocked near his 
hip, left arm curved before him in a 
blocking position. “Jo-dan! " The 
word came out in an explosive 
breath. 

George grunted: “Uhssf’’ 

Fred sprang forward and ad- 
vanced in long deliberate strides, 
and with each stride one of his fists 
drove like a piston at George’s 
chin. George flowed backward 
easily, staying just ahead of the 
punches, pressing each of them 
aside at the last moment with an 
economical open-handed block 
perfectly timed against Fred’s ex- 
tended arm. His short legs grace- 
fully matched the speed and 
rhythm of the long ones driving at 
him. What he was doing looked 
quite easy. After he had gauged the 
first punch, George’s eyes moved 
downward between punches, ap- 
praising the movements of Fred’s 
feet and hips. 

With his fifth punch Fred halted 
and stood motionless, arm still ex- 
tended. Instantly George came 
blurring back at him with a 
counterpunch that was evidently an 
expected part of the ritualized com- 
bat; he snapped it to a halt a centi- 
meter from Fred’s unmoving chin. 

Now it was Fred’s turn to draw 



himself up straight, while George 
crouched for the attack. 

“Jo- dan!" 

“Uhss!" 

George charged. Somehow he 
made his shortness look like an ad- 
vantage. The sleeves of his white 
jacket snapped audibly with each 
punch. Fred retreated stiffly and 
hurriedly, parrying with heavy 
blocks that looked comparatively 
awkward. When it came time for 
his counterattack he essayed an 
arm-grab and kick to the stomach 
which George did not attempt to 
avoid. The snapping kick just 
touched George’s jacket, as it was 
evidently supposed to do, but 
George still seemed to find it unsat- 
isfactory. “Try again,” he ordered. 

Fred went through the grab-and- 
kick again. George said nothing. 
Art got the impression that Fred 
was failing his test. 

George exchanged bows with his 
opponent, and turned to Art. “Art, 
switch the andys on, will you? The 
console by the desk.” 

Art found the power switch. 
There came a whispering of cables 
up above, and the four androids 
started to descend, hanged men 
coming down for vengeance. Their 
wire cables lowered them slowly, as 
their still-blind faces turned this 
way and that and their plastic limbs 
began to quiver and stir. By the 
time the androids’ feet had touched 
down on polished wood, their legs 
had life and balance enough to let 
them stand. 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



57 




The cables detached themselves 
and were quickly reeled up out of 
the way by the overhead machinery. 
Four men of about average height 
were left standing in the middle of 
the floor. Their heads and hands 
and feet were tan, the rest of their 
bodies white, as though clothed in 
beltless karate outfits. At the 
crotch of each appeared a small, 
formalized codpiece-bulge. Their 
tan faces were featureless except for 
small recessed eye lenses and 
flattish dummy noses. Like 
superior creatures lost in their own 
proud thoughts, they stood with 
loosely hanging arms, ignoring the 
three real men who watched them. 

George, coming over to the con- 
sole, called back to Fred: “Want to 
run through heian number four?” 

Fred shrugged. “Okay.” He 
frowned at the man-like figures, as 
if hoping to intimidate them. 

The four androids were warmed 
up and fully active now, and as 
George set up their controls they 
obediently arranged themselves in 
the center of the floor, facing one 
another like four cardplayers look- 
ing across a large square table. 
Each was crouched in the same at- 
tacking position that the men had 
used for the ritual sparring. 

“You don’t fight all four at once, 
do you?” Art asked. “I’ve seen 
karate on television a few times, 
but 1 confess I never paid too much 
attention.” 

George dismissed television ka- 
rate with a mere lipcurl of con- 



tempt. “What speed do you want, 
Freddy? How about Three or 
Four?” 

Fred flushed slightly. He stood 
with his hands on his hips, swing- 
ing his legs again. “I can handle 
One-point-five, or Two.” 

After a moment George said: 
“Try Two-point-five, then,” and 
set a dial. “Better get a helmet.” 

“Okay.” Fred trotted to the 
locker room. 

ART was interested. “Then he is 
going to fight all four at once.” 

“Just in a kind of formalized 
way, a pre-arranged exercise. They 
come at you one at a time, and any- 
body who has some training and 
who has memorized the moves of 
the particular heian can do it. If he 
keeps his nerve. And if the speed’s 
set low enough. He wants to do it 
pretty fast.” For a moment 
George’s face said openly: It’s his 
funeral. 

Something about the fighting 
machines fascinated Art. The way 
they stood there on the polished 
wood like outsize chessmen, wait- 
ing for an act of human control to 
impel them to ritual battle. He ask- 
ed: “Is it all right if I take a closer 
look?” 

George glanced at the controls. 
“Go ahead.” 

Art padded over to the androids. 
They did not seem to notice him, as 
they waited with impassive poise. If 
you order us to punch and kick 
you. Lord Man, so will we do. Art

peered into dull lens-eyes and 
wondered what image they made of 
him. With a cautious finger he 
touched the plastic knuckles of one 
cocked tan fist. Not as hard as the 
proverbial rock, but not what one 
would call safely padded, either. 
The fingers of the hand were not 
really separate, but only indicated 
by grooves in the one plastic piece. 

“Feels as if it could kill you.” 

“Not likely, they don’t really hit 
like black belts.” George smiled 
briefly. “Does sting a little, 
though.” 

“You’ve been hit, then.” 

“bh, sure. Not seriously. Yes, 
these things can be dangerous. We 
sometimes put big padded hands 
and feet on’em for novices. But if 
there’s no real element of danger 
when you train, you can’t really 
train properly.” He glanced toward 
the locker room. There came the 
sound of a toilet flushing. “Fred’s 
no novice. But he’s nowhere near as 
good as he’s been telling me he is. I 
just can’t hire him now.” 

“Then why — ?” Art gestured at 
(he androids. 

“Oh, 1 owe him a full fair tryout, 

1 guess. And he’s got good potential 
if he’d settle down and practice 
every day.” 

Fred came back, fitting on some- 
thing like a fencer’s mask. “I found 
a face protector. I like it bettern a 
whole helmet.” 

“All right,” said George, stand- 
ing by the console. 

Fred moved in among the 



androids, and oriented himself 
carefully at the center of the space 
between them, where he was the 
focus of all their lenses. He drew a 
deep breath and then stood up re- 
laxed. “Ready.” 

George touehed a red control, 
and instantly bright red warnings 
glowed into life in the eyes of each 
mechanical figure. Somewhere a 
small repeater chime began to 
sound, one, two, three, four, five 
notes and the android at Fred’s left 
lunged at him with a punch too fast 
for Art to follow. Fred was ready 
though and his left arm snapped up 
to block the attack while his right 
hand came whipping around edge- 
wise to hit home like a hatchet on 
the tan plastic neck. The aggressor 
machine was sent staggering back. 
Meanwhile another was already 
charging. 

Each android charged in turn, 
was beaten off, reset itself quickly, 
and in its next turn came back to 
the attack again, aiming another 
blow or kick at Fred, or grabbing at 
his jacket with clamplike fingerless 
hands. About half a minute passed, 
while Fred piled up points. 

Fred spun from side to side, de- 
fending himself with vicious blocks, 
counterattacking with fists and feet 
and elbows. His face was rigid with 
concentration — or was it fear and 
hate he showed? He reached out 
and pulled down an android’s 
head, smashing the blank uncaring 
face against his driving knee. Again 
he spun around — 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



59 




Not quite in time. A savage 
punch glanced off his skull, and 
down he went. 

Art moved with an electronic 
technician’s instinct for the power 
switch, but George’s hand was 
there already. For an instant the 
androids hesitated, looking for fair 
game. Then their eyes died and 
their bodies fell clattering to the 
wooden floor. 

Fred was rolling over on the 
floor, gasping and moaning, 
clutching at his head. Art and 
George went to him. He rolled just 
as Art bent down, and Art’s hand 
was besmeared with a drop of 
Fred’s blood. 

“They changed speed!” Fred sat 
up, dripping blood onto his white 
jacket. “1 almost had’em, and then 
something went wrong . ah, 
triplets, that hurts! I swear they 
changed on me ...” Fred was 
practically sobbing with exertion, 
pain, defeat. 

Having played chess against 
computers. Art thought that 
perhaps he understood Fred’s feel- 
ings. But since he had risked no 
blood against the chess computers, 
Art said only: “Lie still. I’ll get a 
towel.” Fred’s scalp was torn but 
still the damage didn’t look too 
serious. 

George stayed with the victim, 
gently getting his face- protector 
off, while Art went to the locker 
room and found a towel and also 
picked up a first aid kit that hung 
there on the wall. He had just 



gotten back to the disaster area 
when the street door of the dojo 
opened and a tall man came in. 
This man was well dressed in trans- 
lucent shorts and business jacket, 
and had dark skin and Oriental 
eyes. As he was starting to bow to 
the flags he noticed what was 
happening, and immediately slipp- 
ed off his shoes and came across the 
floor. 

“Have an accident?” 

“Oh, hello. Doc. Yes,” said 
George, getting to his feet. Fred 
also started to get up, then sat back 
on the floor as the man who had 
just come in bent to look at his torn 
scalp. 

Accepting the towel from Art, 
Doc dabbed around the wound. 
“This looks like it’ll need some 
glue. Ivor, fetch my bag in from the 
car, will you?” 

Another man, youngish and of 
undistinguished appearance, who 
had followed the doctor in and then 
had remained uncertainly near the 
door, gave a little salute with his 
fingers like a chauffeur or a servant 
and then ducked out. 

“Doc,” said George, “this is Art 
Rodney, my sister’s husband. Art, 
this is Dr. Hammad.” 

With a look as of recognition, the 
doctor nodded, and reached to 
shake Art’s hand. 

George said: “Art, when you 
have a chance, you can consult the 
doctor about your problem. He’s 
your man.”

SF EAST 

AN SF SAFARI TO REDLAND 

FREDERIK POHL 



E arly in March my phone rang. 

Vienna was on the line, the 
U.S. Embassy: “Would you con- 
sider coming to Eastern Europe to 
speak on science fiction for the 
U.S. I. A.?” 

1 won’t lie to you, this is not the 
sort of thing that happens every day 
at our house. But it seems to be 
happening more in the last few 
years than it used to; in the recent 
past I’ve accepted similar offers, 
from one government or another, to 
visit Italy, Japan, Brazil and a few 
other countries, not to mention the 
usual run of speaking engagements 
for schools, corporations and insti- 
tutions. 1 am not alone in this. Over 
the past decade I’ve seen Brian Al- 
diss, for instance, any number of 
times; and with the possible excep- 
tion of London, I don’t think we’ve 
ever run into each other in the same 
city twice. This is almost as true of 
my long-term friendship with 
Arthur Clarke. Robert Silverberg, 



Robert A. Heinlein and half a 
dozen others. We are becoming a 
pretty peripatetic lot, we sf writers. 

All this traveling has been edu- 
cational to me: it has taught me 
that sf people are a breed apart. 
Sometimes the color of the skin is 
different, or the shape of the eyes. 
Often we have trouble with langu- 
ages (how nasty it is of everyone else 
not to speak English!), and almost 
as often our governments don’t get 
along very well. But the people 
themselves are never different. The 
science-fiction fans, the editors, the 
writers, the artists — they are always 
and everlastingly the same; and I 
have felt more at home in Nagoya 
or Montreal with my own kind than 
I usually do with my neighbors next 
door. The qualities that interest 
you and me in sf here in America 
are the same qualities that interest 
all those other people in it, too: We 
are of one blood, you and I; and the 
culture shock of a different nation- 



62 




ality or tongue lasts half an hour at 
the most. 

Nevertheless, Eastern Europe 
was something special. I had only 
visited that whole part of the world 
once or twice before, and very brief- 
ly. So I didn’t think very long; I 
said yes, and began packing. 

The statistics: I was gone a little 
under a month. I gave eight formal 
lectures, participated in eleven 
round-tables, gave twenty-one TV, 
radio, newspaper and magazine 
interviews and took part in some- 
thing like thirty “other functions,” 
ranging from a meeting in a 
publisher’s office to an all-night 
drinking party in a Soviet night 
club. I don’t remember all this; I’m 
quoting from a summary the State 
Department made for me. I 
especially don’t remember the 
Soviet night club, or at least not all 
that clearly. It was a hard evening. 

What I do remember is a little 
chaotic and disconnected, in the 
form of notes 1 jotted down on air- 
planes and trains and while waiting 
for a car to pick me up; and here it 
is. 

^^ELGRADE, YUGOSLAVIA 

The Yugoslav publishing indus- 
try has a lot of problems that Amer- 
icans don’t face, and many of them 
come from the sheer difference in 
size. Yugoslavia is not a very big 
country to begin with. And it has 
four — count ’em, four — official 
languages. 



Nevertheless they do have a con- 
siderable amount of publishing, 
and quite a fair amount of that is 
science fiction: hard-cover books, 
paperback books and even maga- 
zines. 

The magazine is particularly in- 
teresting. It is called Galaksija. It is 
not related to the American 
Galaxy, but is a sort of young 
people’s popular-science magazine. 
Every month they devote their 
centerfold to one or two sf stories, 
usually translations from foreign 
writers: Henri Slesar, Anatolij 

Dnjeprov, Brajan Oldis, Artur 
Klark, Frederik Pol, Deni Plahta 
are common bylines. The editor is a 
really fine fellow named Gavrilo 
Vuckovic. He started Galaksija a 
couple of years ago with a circula- 
tion of 5,000 copies; it is now 
50.000 and they expect 100,000 
quite soon. So they are going to 
spin off an all-sf magazine, they 
hope, maybe late this year. 

You can move around quite 
freely in Yugoslavia, but tourists do 
encounter a few problems now and 
then. For example, there is Yugo- 
slavia’s answer to the Pentagon, the 
building called The Gorges. This is 
Yugo Army HQ, and it got that 
name because the architect design- 
ed it to look like the mountain 
gorges where the Yugoslav parti- 
sans fought against the Germans in 
World War II: jagged building 
edges cantilevered partway across 
one of the main streets of Belgrade. 



63 




It is interesting looking, so tourists 
often stop and take pictures of it, 
and then they get arrested if a cop 
sees them. Photographing Army in- 
stallations is a crime in Yugoslavia. 
(There are no signs warning you 
against it, either.) A foolish law? 
Sure. You know that and I know 
that. But the police, they don’t 
know that, so they arrest you. 

Esperantists; The Belgrade Es- 
peranto Association is at 42 
Marsala Tita. 

The thing to remember about the 
Yugoslavs is that they have spent 
most of their history being conquer- 
ed and fighting themselves free 
again. If the city of Belgrade makes 
it through to the end of this year 
without being occupied by any 
foreign army it will be, someone 
told me, the first time since the 
Romans invaded that they have 
managed thirty consecutive years 
without some foreign army running 
their city. 

Politically they are wise as 
wolves. One of the favorite strolling 
and playground parks in Belgrade 
used to be a Turkish fortress. Kids 
ride the merry-go-round where the 
Turks used to impale Serbs on 
sharpened stakes, and leave them 
there so their screams would notify 
the other Serbs who was boss. All 
the Yugoslavs know all about it, 
even the little kids. For two thou- 
sand years someone or other has al- 
most always been shoving a sharp- 



ened stick up their asses. When no 
outsider appeared to do the job 
they did it to each other: Serbs to 
Croats to Slovenes to Macedonians 
to whoever. They are wary, skepti- 
cal and outspoken. They respect 
both USA and USSR, but don’t 
trust either. I like them. 

It surprised me — in view of this 
bred-in wariness of theirs — to find 
they liked me, too — more accurate- 
ly, it surprised me that on very 
short acquaintance I found I was 
being given more warmth and trust 
than I had any reason to expect. 
Then someone explained it to me. 
The acquaintance was not short at 
all. The Yugoslav sf readers had 
known me very well for a good 
many years, as they know a lot of 
Western sf writers, through our 
published work. 

Principal sf book publishing 
house is called “jugoslavie,” and 
they bring out a nice-looking line of 
hardbounds in uniform black-and- 
white laminated plastic covers: 
Brave New World, The Space Mer- 
chants, 1984, Blish’s The Seedling 
Stars and other by English-Ameri- 
can authors, plus writers from 
France (Vercours), the USSR (the 
Strugatsky brothers) and else- 
where. There does not seem to be 
any real native science fiction in 
Yugoslavia. A few writers have 
tried it, but none have been trans- 
lated into English, and the locals 
spoke politely but not enthusiasti- 
cally about their work.

GALAXY 




Nearly every sf book is available, 
at least in small quantities, in im- 
ported editions, usually English 
Penquins or French paperbacks. I 
assume there is some sort of censor- 
ship. but it does not seem terribly 
strict. 1 saw everything from Solz- 
henitsyn through karate manuals to 
raunchy German nudie magazines 
freely on sale, in general publishing 
categories, and a wide assortment 
of sf. They are all in foreign langu- 
ages, but that doesn’t make as 
much difference as it might in, say, 
the U.S. Nearly all educated Yugo- 
slavs appear to speak at least two 
languages well, and I have met 
some who were fluent in eight or 
ten. 

Belgrade names its principal 
streets after great revolutionary 
leaders of history, including that 
great American, Dzordza Vasing- 
tona. 

One of my public lectures got 
canceled for political reasons. It 
wasn’t banned, exactly. It was just 
that there was some sort of unclear 
directive, and the sponsoring 
authority decided to play it safe and 
call the lecture off. Another, under 
exactly the same directive, went off 
freely and to a large audience. 

That was in the Student Cultural 
Centre — a snappy looking building 
out of a 1930s Astaire-Rogers 
movie, that before the war had 
been a Royal Yugoslav Arniy 
officers’ club. The audience was 



nominally “youth,” although 1 saw 
at least four or five men with actual 
long white beards, and it went very 
well, especially in the discussion 
period that followed. 

This is a major difference be- 
tween Yugoslavia and other East- 
bloc countries: the Yugoslavs are 
willing to get up and talk in public. 
The discussion was a lot like any 
American college or sf-club rap ses- 
sion, including impassioned debate 
on New Wave vs. Old. One student 
made a 15-minute impassioned 
speech in Serbo-Croatian denounc- 
ing me for my invidious attack 
against Stanley Kubrick (I had said 
that in my opinion the last third of 
2001 was a meaning-free light show 
plus some stale Jean Cocteau sur- 
realism; 1 have said the same thing 
to American audiences, and gotten 
the same response.) For a moment 
it felt like a lynch mob forming, 
and everybody was trying to talk at 
once. 

Attendance was 98% male. None 
of the few girls present took any 
part in the discussion, although at 
my press conferences several of the 
reporters were pretty young girls, at 
least one of them a red-hot fan. 

There’s a handsome mountain 
called Avala near Belgrade; people 
go there on one-day excursions. It 
has a very modern TV tower, and a 
celebrated monument to the Yugo- 
slav war dead. It also has a small 
plague to the memory of Soviet 
Marshal Zhokov, who died there a 



FORUM 



65 




few years ago when his plane crash- 
ed into the mountain. The guide 
books don’t say much about the 
plaque. Every Yugoslav knows all 
about it, though. When Zhukov de- 
cided to come to Belgrade on a 
state visit the Russians insisted on 
putting their own air traffic con- 
troller in the airport tower, and the 
poor fellow got mixed up between 
feet and meters in giving landing 
instructions. He wound up guiding 
the plane in about fifty feet under 
the runway. The Yugoslavs are 
powerfully grateful the ATC was a 
Russian. The ATC himself, of 
course, probably hasn’t got that 
much to be grateful for. 

Yugo TV has sampled most of 
the American science-fiction pro- 
grams, without any of them being 
very popular. It surprised me that 
Star Trek didn’t go bigger. With all 
the Trekkies in the U.S., I confi- 
dently expected at least some mad 
partisanship anywhere in the world 
the series appeared . but the 
Yugos (remember?) aren’t much 
given to wild enthusiasm. The ones 
1 talked to about it shrugged and 
said politely, “Perhaps twenty years 
ago it would have been more in- 
teresting.” So it ran four weeks and 
that was that. 

1 was in Belgrade during the 
Tenth Party Congress, which 
meant the hotels were full of Com- 
munist Party Delegates from all 
over the world, even places like San 



Marino, and four or five times a 
day the main streets would be 
closed off so that some big wheel, 
usually Marshal Tito, could drive 
by at ninety miles an hour. You can 
always tell when it’s Tito, because 
his private ambulance is always in 
the motorcade. He is 82, and that 
week he was made President of 
Yugoslavia for life. 

1 said delicately to a Yugoslavian 
friend that making a man of 82 life 
president was not quite as far- 
reaching a step as with a man, of 
say, half that age. He said, just as 
delicately, that that point had not 
been lost on anyone. 

Yugoslavia has its own science- 
fiction film Festival, more or less 
competing with the one every year 
in Trieste, Italy, right across the 
Adriatic. Yugoslavia’s is “bi- 
ennial,” which means whenever 
they can afford to put it on. The 
next one will likely be in 1975. It 
will be held on the Adriatic coast, 
with the most marvelous mountains 
and bays you’ve ever seen . and 
the most terrifying German drivers 
of Porsches and Audis, down from 
Munich for the weekend and deter- 
mined to make the round trip in 
record time. 

Yugoslav food is good, at least 
up to a point, but the best dishes 
are native. If you don’t have an in- 
terpreter, you can always fall back 
on Yugoslavia’s answer to the hot 
dog, What’s-Its-Name-10. That 
isn’t its real name, but it’s all you 



66 



GALAXY 




need to order it. It looks like ten 
small sausages, tastes somewhere 
between a spicy hamburger and an 
ungreasy hot dog and is always 
served with plenty of chopped raw 
onion. Very good, especially if you 
don’t plan to breathe on anyone. Its 
special virtue is that you don’t need 
to know its name. It is always 
served 10 pieces at a time, and it is 
the only dish that is always served 
that way, so whenever you see 
.Something-or-Other-10 on a Yugo- 
slav menu that’s it. Just point to it 
and enjoy. 

The State Department offered 
me all sorts of visual aids and stuff 
to help dress up my tour. I said, 
“yes, thank you’’ to everything, and 
that was the last we heard of that. 
Except for the films. They asked 
me what films 1 thought would be 
of interest in Eastern Europe, men- 
tioning that their own researchers 
had suggested Fantastic Voyage, 
Forbidden Planet. Silent Running 
and The Thing. I said with great 
tact that these were all fine films, 
but not exactly the newest and most 
exciting. 1 recommended 2001, 
Sleeper, Westworld and several 
others. 

So we got Fantastic Voyage, For- 
bidden Planet, Silent Running and 
The Thing. 

^Jhe basic lecture 

At least 1 knew something about 
each of the four films: the handi- 



capped children who had played 
the robots in Silent Running, 
the background of Forbidden 
Planet and the subsequent adven- 
tures of Robby the Robot, the mak- 
ing of Fantastic Voyage as it had 
been told to me by Jerry Bixby, who 
wrote the script. And I was happy 
to tell them the inside story of The 
Thing. Time was when the late 
John W. Campbell wrote a truly 
marvelous science-fiction story. It 
was called Who Goes There?, and 
it has been voted the most famous 
science-fiction novella of all time, 
and it deserves it. Who Goes 
There? took place on the South 
Pole, involved a creature from 
outer space who could assume any 
shape he chose, even yours or mine, 
undetectably, and was not only 
rattling good adventure but 
contained much meat for philoso- 
phizing on questions of identity, 
good and evil and all that. It was 
really a fine story, and it would 
have made a marvelous movie. 

A producer who read it realized 
this, so he bought it. He then 
turned it over to a script writer. 
Who made some changes. 

It had been at the South Pole; he 
changed it to the North Pole. It had 
been about an alien who could as- 
sume any shape; it now became 
about an alien who had a very 
specific shape: he looked like a 
giant, man-eating carrot. And all 
the thought and insight into iden- 
tity and reality were dropped in 
favor of one of the dumbest boy- 



FORUM 



67 




girl stories I have ever seen, plus a 
lot of people being hit over the 
head. And he put it all together and 
called it The Thing (short for The 
Thing from Outer Space). 

1 do not want to give you the im- 
pression that 1 dislike The Thing. 
That would be a wrong impression. 
I loathe it. For one thing, I had to 
see it three times in three weeks; 
and you don’t know how bad a film 
is until you watch it with a bunch of 
people who don’t understand the 
dialogue and have to get by on the 
visual story, which in this particu- 
lar film hardly exists. For another, 
even if it were a good film I would 
resent it. It is a travesty on Who 
Goes There?, which could have 
been a superb film and now, be- 
cause The Thing was made, will 
never be a film at all. 

I also told the Eastblockers 
about what was happening in 
current American science fiction. 

To illustrate, I told them about 
three different, brand-new books — 
two of them so new that they 
haven’t been published yet, 
although they will be very shortly. I 
selected the books with some care, 
first because 1 consider them fine 
books, second because there is very 
little chance that any of them will 
ever be published in any of the 
Eastbloc countries, and yet they 
signify to me some of the most in- 
teresting new directions in sf today. 

One was Samuel R. Delany’s 
mammoth new novel, Dhalgren: a 



counter-culture story about a 
strange city somewhere in America, 
where some inexplicable disaster 
has taken place. Dhalgren is the 
most sensually explicit sf novel I re- 
member reading. It isn’t porno; but 
it is naked, nothing is fudged, 
nothing is concealed, everything is 
explored. 

The second was Joanna Russ’s 
The Female Man: a brilliant para- 
time novel about women in three 
parallel worlds, and a tract for 
women’s lib . so good that I ad- 
mire it immensely, although I have 
the bad luck to be a man. 

The third is Ursula LeGuin’s The 
Dispossessed: an interplanetary 

socio-space opera, beautifully writ- 
ten and peopled, taking place on 
the worlds around a distant star 
after the Earth has all but destroy- 
ed itself. It too is a tract — -for a sort 
of libertarian anarchy, against Big 
Government. 

1 do not believe Eastern Europe 
will see very much of these books. 
The LeGuin is, I am sure, politi- 
cally unacceptable. So, in a differ- 
ent way, is the Russ: the women’s 
liberation movement does not exist 
anywhere in Eastern Europe. It is 
not allowed to exist; official govern- 
ment wisdom decrees that it has al- 
ready attained its objectives, under 
their laws. And the Delany is the 
least publishable of them all, by 
Redland standards. Socialist coun- 
tries are less sexually tolerant than 
Queen Victoria ever was. 

I also told them about as many 



68 



GALAXY 




other Western writers as 1 had time 
for. There are only about half a 
dozen living Western sf writers who 
are fairly well known through the 
socialist countries. I’m one, mostly 
on the basis of three or four very 
widely translated books and stories 
like The Space Merchants, Tunnel 
Under the World and The Midas 
Plague. Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asi- 
mov. Arthur C. Clarke, and at 
most one or two others complete 
the list. Of people like Larry Niven, 
Andre Norton, Frank Herbert, 
even Robert A. Heinleirt they have 
heard very little; so 1 tried to tell 
them, too, about the writers I 
thought they might publish . 
especially as most of the Eastbloc 
countries have now joined the Inter- 
national Copyright Convention, 
and presumably will start paying 
for new books in real, globally 
spendable currency. 

When there was a general 
audience (as distinct from members 
of the Writer’s Union, Journalists, 
etc.), 1 also tried to tell them some- 
thing about the weird and wonder- 
ful world of American science-fic- 
tion fandom, with its conventions, 
fanzines, feuds and enthusiasms. 

But 1 don’t think they believed 
me. 

The hardest thing for me to get 
across in this whole series of en- 
counters was that there are no an- 
swers to questions like, “What does 
American science fiction think of 
the future?” or “How does Ameri- 



can science fiction view political 
questions?” Over and over 1 kept 
repeating that we are a bunch of 
stubborn individualists, and what 
is true of Delany is nowhere near 
true of Niven, Heinlein does not 
map against Bradbury, etc. 

I am not sure they believed me 
there, either. To some extent I 
think many Eastbloc sf writers can- 
not imagine a society in which there 
is not a party line. And I suspect 
that some of them would be uncom- 
fortable without the guidance it 
provides. 

^^UCHAREST, ROMANIA 

Bucharest is a beautiful city. 
Looks like a clean Paris. You can 
live like a king in Bucharest, if you 
have the money. 

1 thought the restaurant food was 
awful, but I am told that is because 
I never got far from the hotel except 
to go to private homes for meals 
(which were great.) Some of the 
specialties are good. A favored fish 
is called “Crap,” so when you pick 
up a menu you are likely to see four 
or five different kinds of crap on it. 
Tourists like to buy canned crap to 
take home for gifts for their 
friends. 1 didn’t do this. I’ve never 
liked the idea of carrying a lot of 
crap around. 

The Romanian Writers’ Union 
laid on a special round-table meet- 
ing for me with their Science-Fic- 
tion Section. It was a full-dress af-

fair: coffee, wine, cakes and the 
Romanian equivalent of slivovitz. 
The long table was loaded with Ro- 
manian sf: about a dozen original 
novels, another dozen short-story 
collections, plus odds and ends. 

They also have translated a fair 
amount of Western sf, but nowhere 
near as much as they would like. 
The reason is commendable. Ro- 
mania is dollar-poor; they try to 
keep their foreign policy and their 
economy independent of Moscow 
(El A1 flies into Bucharest, and Ro- 
mania kept up diplomatic relations 
with Israel all through the distur- 
bances), and so they devote most of 
their export earnings to heavy ma- 
chinery for industrialization. On 
the other hand, they don’t publish 
without paying, as Certain Neigh- 
bor Nations have been known to 
do. When they can find a way to 
pay for more, they will publish 
more. They are, I think, a likeable 
lot. (But it may be that I am an easy 
mark: I’ve never been in a country 
where 1 didn’t find people 1 liked a 
lot. Nor have 1 ever been in a coun- 
try where I liked the government 
very much . including my own.) 

The Secretary of the Writers’ 
Union, Ion Hobana, is himself a 
science-fiction writer of consider- 
able distinction. He is a handsome, 
distinguished-looking, cordial, in- 
telligent man somewhat resembling 
Philip Jose Farmer. He has traveled 
widely, has read everything of any 
importance in American and in fact 
world science fiction and would be 



an asset to any writers’ or pub- 
lishers’ group anywhere. He, 
through the Writers’ Union, does a 
lot to encourage new sf blood in 
Romania. Last year they had a 
nationwide contest to discover new 
talent. “Several hundred’’ amateur 
stories were entered, each with the 
names removed to give each a fair 
chance. About forty were consider- 
ed promising enough for the final 
round, and the winner was a young 
man named Mircea Oprita. They 
tell me he writes extremely ma- 
turely and well, and I hope some- 
how to find a way to get some of his 
work published in the U.S. 

You don’t have to belong to the 
Writers’ Union to get published. It 
is a little bit like the SFWA: after 
you’ve published a few stories, the 
Union will probably invite you to 
join. Then you get the benefits: 
protection on royalties and sub- 
sidiary rights, opportunities to use 
the club facilities, use of Union- 
owned vacation hotels, etc. I did 
not see these in Romania, but if 
they are half what they’re cracked 
up to be I would like to join that 
union. 

After I spoke at the Writers’ 
Union roundtable there was quite a 
lengthy and varied discussion. One 
man got up and made a lengthy re- 
joinder in abstract, metaphysical 
terms, which appeared to concen- 
trate on the subject of The Meaning 
of SF Considered as Mythopoeia. 
When he was finished several of the 
writers present immediately said.

“That's your opinion,” and one 
said the Romanian equivalent of 
“Bullshit.” 

Made me feel right at home, that 
did. 

The place in Bucharest you 
shouldn’t photograph is the head- 
quarters building of the Com- 
munist Party of Romania. There is 
no particular reason that you would 
want to, except that it happens to 
be right behind a pretty church and 
park. The cops lurk in the park. 

1 saw my only Eastbloc fanzine in 
Romania. 

Throughout socialist Europe 
all printing facilities, including 
mimeograph machines, are all 
state-owned, and it is not advisable 
to try to set one up in your base- 
ment. So all publishing is official. 
The fanzine, named Solaris, gets 
around this by using the mimeo 
facilities of a university. It is pub- 
lished. edited and written by stu- 
dents. 

1 am not very sure of its contents 
(anyone who reads French, Spanish 
or Italian can make out a few words 
of Romanian, but in my case not 
enough to have much confidence), 
but they appear to be entirely fic- 
tion; no articles, no columns, no 
fan feuds, no ads for Star Trek 
posters. 

1 asked the American Embassy 
in Moscow to wire me a copy of my 
Russian travel plans via the Ameri- 



can Embassy in Bucharest. They 
did, right off. Unfortunately some- 
body along the line marked it 
“classified,” so they couldn’t show 
it to me. 

A Romanian translator is now 
finishing up a version of J.R.R. 
Tolkien’s The Hobbit for im- 
mediate publication. The same 
translator did Salinger’s Catcher in 
the Rye, which sold out nationwide 
in twelve hours. They expect Tol- 
kien to sell out just as fast. 

The University of Bucharest 
maintains an Institute of Futurol- 
ogy. 1 had a pleasant meeting with 
two of their head persons. They 
were very interested in western fore- 
casting (“primarily, of course, in 
methodology and validation pro- 
cesses; not, of course, in political or 
ideological matters,” one of them 
spelled out) and 1 promised to put 
them on the mailing list for the 
World Future Society’s 1975 
General Assembly in Washington. 

Their basic approach to forecast- 
ing is analytical and mathematical. 
It so happens that 1 consider this 
approach hopelessly formal and 
sterile. 1 explained this to them, 
and they courteously inclined their 
heads.

veterans of the Japanese Interna- 
tional Science-Fiction Symposium 
of 1970. 

That was a marvelous bash. The 
Japanese had imported a selection 
of foreign writers: Judith Merril, 
for Canada; Brian W. Aldiss, Eng- 
land; Arthur C. Clarke, delegate 
for the world at large (but prin- 
cipally Sri Lanka, as they have now 
taken to calling his home base of 
Ceylon); myself for the U.S. 

And there was also a five-man 
Soviet delegation, headed by a 
handsome, cosmopolitan editor 
named Vassili Zakharchenko. My 
wife and 1 had happened to meet 
one of the other Soviets, a teacher- 
critic-historian named Y-uli Kagar- 
litski, in London a few years ear- 
lier, and found him delightfully 
humorous and well informed. 
Otherwise East and West were total 
strangers. It was like a miniature 
U.N. We each knew the members 
of our own bloc very well, and 
looked with suspicion and curiosity 
at all the strangers. We tended to 
huddle in our own groups and peer 
perplexedly at the others: The 
western sf people on one side, the 
Soviets on the other and the Japan- 
ese huddling worriedly in between. 

It looked like being a sticky 
week. 

It did not begin particularly well, 
either. Arthur Clarke gave a 
keynote speech, quite formal, on 
the challenge of space. Vassili Zak- 
harchenko gave an equally formal 
address on socialist realism in sf. 



Considered purely as lectures, they 
were up to the very high profes- 
sional standards of excellence of 
both of them; but considered as 
first tentative steps to friendly asso- 
ciation, they didn’t do much. For 
one thing, the translation problem 
was acute. The Japanese had wisely 
provided two sets of translators: 
one fluent in English, the other 
fluent in science fiction. It didn’t 
solve the problem, but it certainly 
eased it. But Zakharchenko chose 
to speak in Russian, fairly enough. 
So their official translator, a pretty 
girl who was part of the delegation, 
first rendered his Russian into 
Japanese, and then the Japanese 
teams did them into English. It all 
took forever, and by the time they 
were finished there was not a great 
deal left of Zakharchenko. 

Also it was a time when interna- 
tional tension was pretty high. 
Pingpong diplomacy had not yet 
started. China was the wild card in 
everybody’s hand. Several of us in 
all three groups were old enough to 
have been in uniform in World War 
11, and it was sort of disconcerting 
to shake somebody’s hand and 
realize that if 1 had happened to en- 
counter him twenty-five years 
earlier it would have been our 
mutual duty to kill each other. And 
above all the US and USSR, like 
the Lion and the Unicorn, were still 
cold-warring for the crown of the 
world . 

Running any kind of science- 
fiction conference is a chancy busi-

ness, since so many of us are prima 
donnas. 1 really admired the cour- 
age of the Japanese. Not only were 
they facing up to all the usual prob- 
lems of logistics and personalities, 
but they must have felt they were 
running a very real risk of starting 
World War III. 

But then, after the formal cere- 
monies, a marvelous Japanese 
writer named Tetsu Yano took 
over. Tetsu is a jolly, bright man 
who designs remarkably innovative 
advertising displays as well as writ- 
ing science fiction. He announced 
that he was master of ceremonies 
for the remainder of the evening, 
and instructed us all, all eight or 
ten Russians, Ukranians, Cana- 
dians, Americans and British 
clumped restlessly on the stage, 
that we would each have to do a 
vaudeville turn. Arthur Clarke was 
required to do a South Sea Islands 
hula. Zakharchenko was instructed 
to give a three-minute speech in 
Japanese. Judy’s assignment was a 
talk on the joys and perils of being 
a grandmother. The Ukranian sf 
writer sang a Ukranian folk 
ballad — no one understood a word 
of it. not even the other Soviets, but 
it was obviously a funny little song. 
My wife, Carol, was asked to as- 
sume that 1 had vanished into 
hyperspace and she had to choose 
her next husband from among the 
couple of hundred people in the 
room. We all did our silly, amus- 
ing, good-natured little bits. And 
all of a sudden the air was let out of 



all our stuffed shirts. We were all 
giggling like fools together, and the 
symposium was alive and well at 
last. For the next week or ten days 
we lived in each others’ pockets, 
drank Armenian brandy and 
American Coke together, sang, 
strolled, lectured, explored: we be- 
came a family. 

So we have all had a very special 
affection for each other since then 
that transcends personal, political 
and national differences; and that 
is why, among other reasons, f was 
looking forward to Moscow. 

M OSCOW, USSR 

Moscow is not only the capital of 
the USSR, it is its biggest city, the 
headquarters of its publishing busi- 
ness, the center of everything and 
the place where every Soviet who 
doesn’t live there wishes he did. It 
is where the Action is. 

To an outsider, it isn’t a particu- 
larly endearing city. It is monu- 
mental rather than beautiful, huge 
rather than appealing. Most of the 
way it looks is due to Joseph 
Stalin. He lived there; and he liked 
to decorate his home in styles that 
appealed to him. What appealed to 
him was mostly heroic statues and 
peculiarly gingerbready skyscrap- 
ers. dotted all over the city, in the 
style that is called Stalin-baroque. 

The celebrated Moscow subway 
is everything that has been claimed 
for it: clean, beautiful, spacious, 
fast, efficient and cheap — seven

cents, to go anywhere in the city. 
And in the last few years Moscow 
has filled up with cars. The Soviets 
imported a whole auto factory from 
the Italian Fiat people, and the re- 
sult is that on the way to the airport 
leaving Moscow 1 was caught in an 
authentic and wholly unexpected 
Moscow traffic jam. 

The public face most Muscovites 
wear is dour and withdrawn. In 
private they are like anybody else, 
or a little jollier. 

The USSR does not maintain any 
real science-fiction magazine, and 
has no immediate plans to publish 
one. However, several of the major 
magazines publish sf (even Litera- 
turya Gazetya, the classiest literary 
weekly), and one or two of them 
publish it regularly. 

One of these is a young people’s 
science and handicraft magazine 
called Teknika-Molodezhi The 
editor is my old Japanese-band-of- 
brothers friend Vassili Zakhar- 
chenko. He publishes some sf in 
every issue, both because he likes it 
and because the readers do. My en- 
tourage and I paid a ceremonial 
visit to their offices. (My entourage 
consisted of a State Department 
official and a Russian translator; 
later on the Writers’ Union added a 
companion-cum-chaperone, and 
from time to time there was also a 
driver and some local dignitaries. It 
was a little like being in a parade.) 
As Teknika-Molodezhi had just 



published two of my stories, they 
ceremoniously handed me a brown- 
paper envelope containing 54 
rubles and 63 kopecs. So I at last 
had my first taste of Moscow Gold. 

(I innocently inquired what had 
become of the royalties on the 
various other books and stories 
published in the Soviet Union over 
the past decade or so. The answer 
was translated very carefully, but I 
do not think I understand it. It had 
something to do with a statute of 
limitations; Moscow Gold is fairy 
gold, it appears, and if you don’t 
pick it up in three years, it melts 
away.) 

The publishing house that owns 
Teknika-Molodezhi also publishes 
a number of science-fiction books, 
as well as a lot of everything; it is a 
big enterprise, with a circulation of 
six million for the magazine alone. 
The editor-in-chief is a woman of 
about fifty, very sharp and under- 
standing, who wants to do more 
science fiction, and probably will. 

Moscow restaurant food is awful. 
(It is better in other USSR cities, 
for some reason.) Most of it is imi- 
tation-cosmopolitan, and even the 
Russian national dishes are spotty. 
There used to be a Chinese restau- 
rant in Moscow that was highly 
recommended. It is still there, but 
not so highly recommended; the 
menu has gone all queer. Appar- 
ently during the problems with 
China the chef went home. 

The best places to eat in Moscow 



74 



GALAXY 




are private or organizational: the 
union clubs. 

The House of Journalists has the 
reputation of possessing the best 
kitchen in Moscow, and it is all due 
to Nikita Khrushchev. When he 
was running the country he believ- 
ed in pampering journalists. So he 
made sure they had the finest chefs, 
the best foodstuffs, the most 
modern and complete facilities and 
the prettiest waitresses. Khrush- 
chev isn’t around any more, so 
things have gone off a little: the 
prettiest of the waitresses married 
Journalists and their replacements 
appear to be dropout Aeroflot hos- 
tesses. But the chef is still extraor- 
dinary. 

The House of Writers is a negli- 
gible amount less exciting for food, 
but a lot more exciting for decor 
and history. In War and Peace 
there is a description of a grand 
ball in Moscow. The ballroom, and 
mansion that housed it, was real, it 
was the home of an extremely 
wealthy nobleman, and Since the 
Revolution it has been the head- 
quarters of the Writers’ Union. 
(The ballroom scenes in the 
Russian film of War and Peace 
were shot there.) And now the 
writers eat where Pierre once 
danced and courted and went out 
to fight Napoleon. 

It is not too easy to get good food 
to cook in Moscow. The state gro- 
cery stores have plenty of food, but 
it’s monotonous and not too choice 
in quality. You get the really good 



stuff from what the collective 
farmers have grown on their own 
initiative and brought up to 
Moscow to peddle. (This is legal, 
up to a point.) The prices are 
scary — apples, $1 — and so it pays a 
farmer to stuff a suitcase full of 
fresh lettuce from his private plot, 
hop in an Aeroflot jet, sell it off in 
Moscow and fly back. It is not just 
apples. It is everything from fresh 
violets to goat cheese — which, I 
think, accounts for the mighty 
aroma that distinguishes Aeroflot 
planes on domestic routes. 

They are building enormous 
greenhouses in the outskirts of the 
northern cities in order to grow 
fresh vegetables hydroponically all 
year around, which may make a 
considerable difference some time. 

Soviet joke: 

On a flight from Soviet Armenia 
to Moscow there was a hijacking. 
Everyone was terrified except for 
one collective farmer, who jumped 
up. attacked the armed hijackers 
with his bare hands, subdued them 
and turned them over to the police. 

“Comrade Collective Farmer,” 
said the militiaman, “you are a 
Hero of Soviet Labor for your in- 
credible bravery.” 

“Bravery-shmavery,” said the 
collective farmer. “What was I 
going to do with 30 kilos of tomatos 
in Turkey?” 

Had lunch with a Soviet Cosmo- 
naut named Valentin Sevastyanov, 



FORUM 



75 




one of the spacemen who spent 
eighteen days in orbit three or four 
years ago. Really bright, assertive, 
intelligent, friendly man. He is 
exactly like the American Astro- 
nauts 1 have met, except about 
10% smaller. (All Soviet cosmo- 
nauts, 1 am told, were required to 
be under 5’6” to tit into their space- 
craft.) 

For years 1 had hostile feelings 
against the American astronauts, 1 
think because of the incredibly 
pompous NASA public-relations 
image they projected. Then I began 
to meet and know some of them, 
and they aren’t like that at all. 
They are good, courageous men 
who have done remarkable things, 
and apart from that they are as 
complex and indefinable as you 
and 1 and everyone else. Valenti 
Sevastyanov was the same admir- 
able breed. He took me to his home 
for a drink (lovely huge apartment 
in the best part of Moscow) and we 
discussed mutual friends and how 
we felt about space. 1 listened with 
interest to what he saw (“The 
strangest thing was the Moon, 
which was yellowish-brown from 
space. The stars were very bright, 
in conspicuous colors, and there 
were two or three times as many as 
from Earth, so that I could not 
recognize constellations.”), and 
shared what he felt (“In orbit I 
could see how small the world was, 
just one tiny grain of dust in the 
universe. I became more sure than 
ever that we must all learn how to 



live on it together like good neigh- 
bors.”). 

One wall of his apartment is 
devoted to medals and trophies, an- 
other to ikons. (“I myself am 
atheist, but I consider these beauti- 
ful art.”) He shares the apartment 
with his pretty wife, young daugh- 
ter, and young daughter’s young 
puppy. The pup is named Snoopy. 

The Soviets are planning to call a 
World Socialist Countries Science 
Fiction International Symposium 
sometime soon. It appears not to be 
definite whether westworlders may 
be invited at least as guests or ob- 
servers. Should be interesting 
either way. 

The USSR has had little or no 
science fiction on radio or tele- 
vision, barring some discussions on 
talk shows. Nothing dramatized 
that anyone could remember. 

1 watched some Russian TV from 
time to time, when I had the chance 
to spend a little time in my hotel 
room. Not knowing the language 
doesn’t help, but my impression is 
that it isn’t a lot of fun. The big 
viewer attraction is sports. The rest 
of it is news or how-to-be-a-better- 
Soviet-person docymentaries or 
films. 

One of the documentaries was on 
the subject of why it is very bad, 
comrade, to be late for work, since 
it means your whole department is 
thrown off schedule. The lecture 
(with film clips illustrating sides of 
beef piling up on hooks because

GALAXY 




Sergei didn’t show up to push them 
over to the other side of the meat- 
packing plant) was delivered by a 
chuckling father-figure with white 
hair. 1 think 1 have seen the same 
fellow on American TV. He was a 
chuckling fatherly doctor selling 
hemmorhoid medicine. 

The one film I saw at any length 
was about a wise, fatherly Red 
Army sergeant whose squad, for 
some reason, had to occupy a vil- 
lage in the Soviet Far East. There 
was this boy who was afraid they 
were going to hurt his goat, so he 
mistakenly threw rocks at them and 
wounded the sergeant, but the ser- 
geant understood the boy’s problem 
and, very decently 1 thought, took 
time to w'in him over. 

On formal debate occasions one 
hears some Soviet sf writers com- 
plain that what is wrong with 
American science fiction is that it 
projects a view of the world of the 
future in which the ordinary man is 
regimented, deprived of his indi- 
vidual rights of self-expression and 
doomed to inhabit a gritty, unsatis- 
fying society. 

1 never did manage to think up a 
reply to this which was both truth- 
ful and polite. 

'^BILISI, LENINGRAD AND OUT 

Tbilisi is the capital of Soviet 
Georgia, and the czars called it 
“Titlis.” The Georgians are a strik- 
ingly self-sufficient people. They 



preserve their traditions with prac- 
tically Yugoslavian stubbornness. 
Stalin liquidated a higher pro- 
portion of Georgians than of any 
other nationality, but he was a 
Georgian himself and they still 
have a sort of wry pride in him. 
(The only picture of Stalin I have 
ever seen in the Soviet Union was a 
portrait on sale in a Tbilisi shop 
window.) 

There are no Georgian sf writers, 
but there may be. While I was there 
the Georgian writers’ union decid- 
ed to set up a special science-fiction 
section, which will start by trans- 
lating Russian and foreign sf into 
Georgian and then, hopefully, will 
try to foster local talent. 

Many, many Georgians appear 
to have read a fair amount of sf in 
Russian translations or in the ori- 
ginals. They like it. They want 
more. 

Anybody care to bet on a Tbilisi 
bid for the 1999 Worldcon? 

Leningrad was the home of the 
Grand Old Man of Soviet science 
fiction, Biyaelev. His books are 
numberless, and most of them still 
in print; 1 am not sure just what 
they are like, but get the impression 
they are basically juveniles with 
adult interest, rather like the Hein- 
leins. Leningrad, of course, was be- 
sieged and surrounded by the Nazis 
throughout three years of World 
War II. The inhabitants were cut 
off from food and fuel, and were re-

duced to burning the books in the 
libraries and eating stews made out 
of the glue from the bindings, 
among even less attractive sub- 
stances. There are no native Lenin- 
graders aged around thirty. All the 
babies and small children either 
were somehow gotten out of the 
city, or died. 

Among the casualties was the 
USSR’s best known sf writer, 
Biyaelev. As far as 1 could find out, 
they do not even know where his 
body was buried. There was not 
much time for niceties in Leningrad 
in the ’40s. 

1 was in Leningrad around the 
time of the summer solstice, and 
would not have missed it for any- 
thing. Leningrad is the farthest 
north of any metropolis in the 
world, not far below the Arctic 
Circle. On Midsummer’s Day the 
sun never really sets. 1 went out to 
dinner and fell into conversation 
(about sf, transformational gram- 
mar and Finnegan's Wake) and in 
the heat of discussion failed to keep 
track of the time. Outside the win- 
dow it was broad daylight, and it 
was a shock to look at my watch at 
last and see that it was one o’clock 
in the morning. So we went 
strolling on the banks of the Neva 
River, two, three o’clock, and 
crowds of people walking around, 
laughing, chatting, couples arm in 
arm, kids listening to Western 
music on transistor radios held to 
their ears. 



It is like champagne bubbling in 
your blood. 1 don’t know why. But 
it is. 

It is a temptation to wind up this 
series of notes with a set of conclu- 
sions about What the USSR is 
Really Like. 1 will try to pass up 
that temptation. What it is like is 
itself, and nothing else. It is every- 
thing you have ever heard about it, 
and many things quite different. It 
is a tightly controlled police state, 
but it is also a place where I heard 
natives say rather astonishingly 
frank things. 

One anecdote. 

While I was waiting for a plane 
at one of the airports I fell into con- 
versation with a couple of journa- 
lists on their way to an assignment. 
They turned out to be dyed-in-the- 
wool sf fans, and we became pretty 
friendly, especially as we were be- 
coming rapidly awash in Soviet 
w ine. So one of them offered a toast 
to us meeting again. And I offered 
a toast to all of us meeting again, 
with their families, in my own coun- 
try. And another of them stood up 
and raised his glass. 

“1 drink,” he said, “to the differ- 
ence between science fiction and 
fantasy. When my friend here pro- 
posed a toast to our meeting again, 
that was science fiction. But then 
my new friend Frederik proposed a 
toast, and that was to all of us 
meeting again, in the United 
States, with our families; and that, 
my dear friends, was fantasy.”

O VER THE pepper-and-salt beard, 
'thick lenses confronted the stu- 



‘You’re with the Chan-Monteith 
Institute? Is this research for a 
paper, or what? Why are you ask- 
ing me all these questions?’ 

The dark young man refilled the 
drinking cup and offered it. The 



79 







melancholy sound of a songtape 
tilled the silence, while the pro- 
fessor’s hand hesitated, then 
accepted. 

‘1 have this feeling I should talk 
to you,’ said the student. ‘I found 
some old records from the Memory 
Project of ’02. 1 wondered what had 
become of you. That’s all.’ 

‘.So now you know what’s become 
of me. I teach biology at Idaho 
A&M. Keep the cup tilled . 
what did you say your name was.’ 
His voice reflected no interest. 
‘Why did you quit?’ 

‘Why does anyone quit?’ The 
man produced an old-fashioned 
pipe and filled it; an elaborate pro- 
cedure of stuffing and tamping. 
‘Not enough reward . the place 
was too claustrophobic . what 
business is it of yours, anyway?’ 
The student smiled, and said 
again, ‘1 had this feeling.’ 

The professor winced. ‘There 
was a time when “having a feeling’’ 
was regarded as crackpot. Unscien- 
tific. The whole Karma bit — we 
didn’t have time for that. We used 
to have discipline. We did our re- 
search logically— step by step, 
proving everything over and over, 
believing nothing we couldn’t 
prove.' 

‘We still do that, even in the 
social sciences,’ replied the stu- 
dent. ‘Did you think scientific 
method had drowned?’ 

‘In a sea of mysticism.’ The pipe 
required relighting, and he spoke 
from a cloud of blue smoke. ‘Listen 



to that drivel. Even the pop songs, 
reduced to a 5-tone scale. We used 
to have tw’elve — we lose and lose.’ 
The boy was used to the Oriental 
resonances of modern instruments,' 
where sympathetic strings iterate 
and reiterate the melody, lingering 
within the ears and bloodstream, 
the delicacy of single tones develop- 
ing into implications of lifetimes . 
or so it was agreed. The tape 
suddenly spew'ed out a cacophony 
of nostalgic rock-and-roll. 

‘Christ!’ the professor slammed 
down his cup. ‘That’s Lui-zhe! It 
was meant for the koto.’ 

‘I thought you didn’t ap- 
prove . .’ 

“‘And the wild horses pulled us 
along the sand, then, in those 
blossom-days . .“’ he quoted 
bitterly. ‘I'hat’s a ch’in song, not 
rock-and-roll. Can’t they tell any- 
thing apart any more?’ 

‘I didn’t really come here to dis- 
cuss music,’ said the student. He 
refilled the emptied cup. ‘I wanted 
to understand why you quit the In- 
stitute.’ 

The older man looked at him, 
and swirled the liquid in the cup. 
He took in the narrow, aquiline 
face, the black straight hair. 

‘How old are you?' 

‘Almost eighteen.’ 

‘I was nineteen when 1 joined the 
Institute. 1 w as there two years.’ He 
fell silent, eyes unfocusing. 

‘I know' that.’ The boy waited. 
Then, ‘You were doing some work 
on the five-root of five.’

Liquor slopped on the plastic 
surface of the table as the man jerk- 
ed. He sat immobile for a moment 
and said, ‘What have you found 
out?’ 

‘Nothing much,’ said the boy 
blandly. ‘1 just have this feeling.’ 

‘.So you have a feeling. What of 
it?’ 

The boy regarded him steadily. 
The back of his neck shivered as he 
gazed at the sharp, self-possessed 
young face. 

‘You too have a feeling. Don’t 
you?’ said the student with a bright 
slow smile. 

‘All right, all right.’ The pro- 
fessor sat back heavily. ‘May god 
help me, I do. 1 don’t understand 
who you are or what you want . 
but I suppose I don’t understand 
who I am either, so what the hell — 
keep that cup tilled, kid. Out of re- 
spect for the dead.’ 

‘Who is dead, then?’ He set 
down the carafe. 

‘1 don’t know why 1 said that . 
fhe place is still going. I’m still go- 
ing. But in those days both of us 
were just out of the egg. All bright 
and shiny new. 

‘'fhe Institute was just about my 
age. sprawling over the last remain- 
ing bit of Connecticut countryside. 
The mysterious East was taking us 
over, lock, stock and barrel. No 
need for the war our parents had 
been so worried about — ^just a 
series of small insignificant events; 
youngsters traveling to god knows 
where looking for mystic experi- 



ence: the meditation-encounter- 

group craze: instant nirvana 

through drugs: and the gradual 
leaking away of faith in the 
capitalist virtues. All things were 
turning inward — no more racing 
for the conquest of outer space. 
And we went socialist. 

‘Suddenly we were having inti- 
mate relations with China. Co- 
operative this, the People’s that. 
The Institute was a symbol of 
“scientific cooperation between the 
People’s Republic of China and the 
United States of America”. Both 
parties contributed their best 
equipment. But with competition, 
there was a shortage of good per- 
sonnel. They had to scrounge all 
over the world . there’s some- 
thing — unstirred — about the state- 
directed . 

‘At any rate, the West had 
swallowed the East, whole. 1 think 
we were choking. Maybe it’s better 
nowadays, 1 don’t know . My 
students here still seem uneasy.’ 

‘We live in interesting times,’ 
said the boy. ‘But some of us see 
great opportunities — very great in- 
deed.’ 

‘Oh, so did we. The only draw- 
back was that we had to work for 
group credit, and the groups didn’t 
quite blend. Sure, they all spoke 
English, but they thought in Man- 
darin. French, Hindi, god knows 
what. It was Mom’s apple pie with 
soy sauce and socialist realism . 
but 1 wasn’t aware of the cultural 
indigestion then. All I knew was

that personal ambition had been 
declared obsolete ... I suppose 
that’s still true, isn’t it?’ 

‘So they say,’ said the student, 
shrugging. The quick flash. of his 
black eyes was not hooded soon 
enough. The man hesitated. 

‘. Fill the cup again.’ He 
wiped his beard. 

^ 1^0 YOU know 1 was in the 
P jMemorv Project. There were 
about fifty of us working on DNA. I 
was in the group trying to isolate 
the memory-controlling compon- 
ents of human chromosomes — by 
working with rats and mice, of 
course.’ 

‘What can you tell about us by 
watching vermin?’ said the boy 
scornfully. 

‘A very great deal. Lab animals 
aren’t vermin; they have been care- 
fully bred for years.’ 

‘So being laboratory-bred makes 
them superior. Interesting. Go on.’ 
The professor frowned. ‘Where 
was I? 

‘We had plenty of animals; we 
had fantastic equipment. The JCN- 
50(X) computer, the BR-700 micro- 
scope — which makes holographic 
images all the way down to atomic 
level. We had a collection of 
chromosome maps, almost all 
blank spaces waiting for us to fill 
them in. Some damn fool scrawled 
“Here there be Dragons” all over 
them, and started a row with the 
Peking contingent. It took nearly a 
month to soothe them down, and 



by then we knew each other pretty 
well, language barriers or no. 

‘Our lab had a central conveyor 
belt that received our slides and 
carried them to be freeze-dried, 
then to whatever microscope we 
wanted to use. We had readout 
panels and an immense library and 
filing system in the computer . 
Christ, that was a marvelous ma- 
chine. Saved months of working 
time.’ 

‘How could you bear to leave it, 
then?’ 

‘I’m getting to that. I’m getting 
to it,’ said the man testily. ‘Don’t 
you kids learn patience along with 
your ideograms? 

‘So there we were, confronted 
with models, holographs, screens, 
data banks, waldoes. all the 
machinery we could possibly need, 
staring into the enigmatic little 
patterns called chromosomes . 

‘I used to be a skinny kid with 
long thin fingers. When 1 was six 1 
could lift a cobweb from its moor- 
ings without breaking it. When I 
was fourteen 1 discovered I could 
turn a girl on by feather-brushing 
my fingertips on the back of her 
neck. A delicate touch, they said. 
Watchmakers were out of date. 
Work with something small, they 
said. Might as well have flippers for 
all the use it was in this job. Small, 
yes. Molecules are like that. 

‘The trouble was that the mean- 
ing of every molecule was altered by 
the meaning of every other, and by 
the time the information reached

our sloppy, gross perceptions it was 
distorted. The machine measured 
as accurately as we could conceive 
measurements; and beyond. Our 
grubby little notions were turned 
ridiculous. We were too ponderous 
to hear the laughter. We never saw 
chromosomes; thousands of square 
feet of JCN saw them for us, 
watched — what? An infinitesimal 
brushing of yes and no, no and yes, 
defining the basis of identity. 1 
began to feel that numbers were the 
wrong language, and that was all 
we had. 

‘The papers piled up. We hunted 
lor clues. We had found out a few 
things, pencilled in a few guesses 
on the blank maps. We had, pos- 
sibly, established that Chromosome 
17 contained some of what we were 
seeking, information that would 
eventually control cortical develop- 
ment. We had applied the 
molecular knife to thousands of 
muscine molecules. There were re- 
sults. oh yes, there were results. We 
had bred mice who had lost the 
sucking reflex and starved with the 
teat in their mouths. We had rats 
who built nests and waited for 
something to happen but had for- 
gotten w hat. We had mice with per- 
fect vision who blundered into ob- 
stacles. and mice who regarded 
(heir food as a mortal enemy. We 
had proved these instincts to be in- 
herited memory, some part of 
which was inherent on Chromo- 
some 17. But we couldn’t isolate 
(he DNA in question, nor could we 



predict what results we would get 
from what seemed to be the 
identical manipulation. 

‘And 1 hated the angle of attack. 
1 dreamed of doing something with 
my animals that would add to their 
capacities — make them remember 
something they could not have 
known — something beyond in- 
stinct. But 1 couldn’t do any more 
with giving than with taking. How 
could you tell if a mouse knows 
something it shouldn’t? They can 
hardly tell you their reminiscences. 

‘And the Skinner-box gadgets 
were a dead end. Once, only once, 
a specimen went immediately to the 
correct set-up, pressed the correct 
button, and did it six times in a 
row . The ghost of Lysenko grinned 
over our shoulders. The other lab 
groups came in to see our Mouse. 
Then the little bastard blew the 
seventh try and never got it right 
again, nor his children nor his 
grandchildren or any unto the 
twentieth generation. We checked 
him out for injury, brain damage, 
anything. No dice. No repetition, 
no explanation. Another mighty 
triumph for Chance. 

‘So we brooded over charts and 
models and holographs until our 
eyes ached, and spent a lot of time 
Fooling around with the girls in the 
group and drinking coffee. The 
molecules hung there on their 
chains, knobs of acid twisted into 
helices making fools of us . 

‘One day while 1 was passing the 
time doodling the door opened and

someone came in with a tray of 
slides. Just another tech in a white 
coat, seen out of the corner of my 
eye, till 1 glanced up. A white 
Cheongsam, not a lab coat, slit up 
the sides. She glided in effortlessly 
balancing the slide boxes, seeming 
to cross the room without any 
visible motions. Her face was plum- 
gold above the white, her smooth 
dark hair coiled high. Her legs 
shimmered inside the long slit 
skirt. 

‘1 dropped my notes in a jumble. 
The slight sound caused my neigh- 
bor to jump and as he raised his 
head to complain he saw her too. 
His expression embarrassed me. I 
closed down my own face. 

‘The girl set the trays on the 
counter and turned to leave. No one 
spoke. She did not seem to notice 
us at all. As the door swung behind 
her the bodies in the room came 
back to life. 

‘Across the table. Lisbeth sighed. 
“I'm going to hang out a sign say- 
ing ‘Plain Sewing,”’ she said, look- 
ing ruefully at her own pretty legs. 
Nobody could answer. Until then 
we had thought her beautiful. 

‘The other men left the room, 
ever so casually. Some returned, 
their expressions saying, do not in- 
trude. I finally escaped and as soon 
as 1 was out of earshot of the others 
pelted down the corridor to An- 
struther’s office.’ 

‘Anstruther!’ said the student. 
‘The Anstruther?’ 

‘Of course, the Anstruther. He 



was Director then. He must be near 
retirement by this time.’ 

‘He has retired,’ said the boy. 
His expression was an odd mixture 
of satisfaction, malice and regret. 
‘Please go on.’ 

WAS that?”’ Idemand- 

VV out of breath. “Who 
was that tech that just came in?” 
‘He smiled, looking sleek and 
smug. “Yes, she is, isn’t she?” he 
said pleasantly. 

‘Anstruther-san, for god’s sake, 
don’t hold out on me now.’ I sup- 
pose 1 was pushing my luck; I 
thought we were friends. 

“‘Calm yourself, Ric. You’re the 
last in line — they’ve all been in here 
in the past couple of minutes.” 

‘1 sat down slowly. 1 managed 
barely to level my wild heartbeat. 
“‘She’s magnificent.” 

“‘I didn’t realize that she would 
cause so much disruption.” He 
swiveled in his leather chair, his 
bulk lumbering after the swinging 
jowl. “She’s just a new tech, that’s 
all. We’re trying her out on the 
job.” 

“‘Well, I’ll tell you something. 
She won’t go home alone tonight.’” 
“‘No. Go back to work, Ric.” 
“‘Won’t you tell me where she 
went? Is that all you’ll say?” 
“‘That’s all.” He withdrew his 
attention. 1 went back. On the way 
1 realized 1 was very angry. Had he 
meant that he would be taking her 
home? Was he presuming to decide 
upon whom he would bestow her.

and did he have any right? At least, 
1 told myself, I hadn’t deluded my- 
self that he and I were close friends. 
What in hell was he up to? My rage 
must have exploded into my voice. 
As 1 reached the lab, I shouted “He 
says she’s just a new tech. Period.’’ 
The chattering of the others died 
back. The air was thick with resent- 
ment. At me, at Anstruther, 1 
didn’t know; but a few minutes 
later 1 was alone. But even my 
microscope panel had gone dark. 

i stayed late anyway. 1 wasn’t 
going to beg. I stared at meaning- 
less notes on the nature of memory. 
The notes stared back. The auto- 
claves and freezers hummed away, 
unperturbed. My fingers kept feel- 
ing the smoothness of pale gold 
thigh instead of paperex. Black 
eyes slanted warmly through the 
charts. I thought 1 had better take 
a walk through the cool night air. 

‘Anstruther’s office light was still 
on. The door was half-open. He 
called, “Come in, Ric.” How had 
he known it was me? Never mind; 
as I pushed the door 1 saw her and 
forgot Anstruther. I remember 
wishing I’d changed my coat. Then 
I stopped. 

‘She stood by his desk, one hand 
resting lightly on an open book. 
She sat in the chair by the wall, her 
hands folded in her lap. She leaned 
against the chair, her hair slipping 
from the smooth coils. She knelt on 
the carpet studying a swatch of ma- 
terial intently. She stood, and faced 
me as I halted, stunned, with one 



foot paralyzed in midair. 

‘“You see, she doesn’t go home 
alone,” said Anstruther merrily. 
“Better let him sit down, girls, be- 
fore he falls over.” 

‘One on each side, they guided 
me, holding my elbows, to the va- 
cated chair. 

“‘This, these, are Nyen-Hwa, 
Ric.” 

‘Five graceful Oriental heads in- 
clined toward me in a queenly ges- 
ture. 1 nodded weakly, like an un- 
strung marionette. 

“‘Er — hello,” I muttered, in- 
audible even to myself. The Perfec- 
tions looked at me gravely. She, 
they, said, “What is the trouble, 
Stan-Tzu?” 

“‘I believe he finds you five times 
as beautiful as he had expected.” 

“‘Ah, ah. ah, ah, ah,” the voices 
murmured. 

‘Anstruther leaned over and 
pulled open a drawer in his desk. 
“You’d better have a drink. You’ve 
been working rather late.” He un- 
sealed a white ceramic bottle. I 
recognized a middling brand of 
mao-tai; one of the ladies brought 
it to me, poured some in a tiny cup. 

’“Thanks.” This time I achieved 
a gurgle. They all bowed again and 
1 gulped at the drink. It steadied 
me a little, enough to say, “An- 
struther-san, you’re enjoying my 
confusion.” 

‘He laughed heartily. “I am, I 
am. Now I’ll take pity on you. 
These ladies are not quintuplets.” 

“‘Not quintuplets,” I repeated

stupidly. He had overestimated me. 
My reasoning powers had not yet 
reached so fine a point. 

‘“Chan-Monteith is a big place. 
Research covers a lot of ground. 
We are rather proud of this little 
flowerbed.” 

‘1 was beginning to catch my 
breath — as long as I kept my eyes 
off the girls. Five of them. 

‘“Yes, Ric, they represent quite 
an achievement . the first suc- 
cessful human clone, raised to ma- 
turity in the Institute . We’ve 
been working on it for years, and 
only made it seventeen years ago. 
What a prize, eh?” 

‘I couldn’t answer. I just sat 
there, as he went on. 

‘“You can read up on it some- 
time, Ric. Right now — I’m in the 
mood to celebrate!” He raised his 
cup in a toast. We drank. 

‘Questions half-formed in me, as 
in a dream. Raised in the Insti- 
tute . what kind of education 
had the girls had, isolated from 
normal society? Even the experi- 
mental animals suffered from 
maternal deprivation; what had 
they been offered as parents? An- 
struther? And how under god had 
they become so exquisite? The 
questions I might have asked then 
escaped me. I cared only that they 
should have known some kind of 
love. Humbled, I no longer felt 
even slightly adequate. 

“‘Aren’t you interested? This is 
the most spectacular genetic ex- 
periment of all time, and you sit 



there like a lump!” Anstruther 
heaved to his feet. “Look at ’em! 
Perfect!” 

‘“I’m — overwhelmed,” I said. 
“What — who — ?” 

“‘Aha! I’m glad you asked.” He 
refilled my cup himself. Waving the 
carafe he gestured at the girls, now 
occupied with the swatches of bro- 
cade, silent. 

“‘They don’t need to talk 
much — to each other. Their minds 
work alike, most of their associa- 
tions are identical — we had some 
trouble teaching them to talk at 
all.” He turned his back to them 
and leaned over me confidentially. 

“‘Wait till the Press hears about 
this,” he whispered. “What a pic- 
ture, eh? . You can chat with 
them whenever you like, if you can 
get ’em to answer you. They aren’t 
very gabby.” He straightened up. 
“Come along, girls, we’ll walk you 
home,” he said expansively. 

‘As one, they rose; the silk van- 
ished. They proceeded, as in pro- 
cession, to the doorway. Each back 
was perfectly straight; each delicate 
head set erect upon its ivory 
column; each pair of peach-grooved 
buttocks nearly motionless, so 
sweet and smooth the walk. 

‘And the musk-and-apple-blos- 
som odour threw me into renewed 
confusion. Was 1 responding to 
what 1 wanted to find — so intense a 
sexuality under the remote inno- 
cence? 

‘Helplessly, attached to An- 
struther and his bouquet, I

followed them down the hall, out 
into the grounds and along the path 
to the distant building we would 
know as the Pavilion. At the en- 
trance we were greeted by a woman 
who introduced herself to me as 
“the girls’ ayah — they call me 
Mariji.” She/they accorded us a 
last formal bow and a smile that 
irradiated the serenity of golden 
faces, and was utterly contained. 

‘They needed no one, nothing. 
As distant as the Tang dynasty, 
they were complete. How inappro- 
priate was my fearful desire . .’” 

T he professor turned his head 
suddenly. The student was star- 
ing with fixed concentration. 
“What are you looking at?” 
‘Sorry. 1 was interested.’ 

‘1 didn’t want to remember all 
this. It’s been more than twenty 
years.’ 

‘Go on. You know you must.’ 
The professor sighed. ‘I wish I 
didn’t have that feeling.’ 

‘The next day was chaotic. An- 
struther had sent a release to the 
science columnists of the major 
papers and TV. As soon as one 
editor had got his hands on one 
photograph, the deluge set in. Even 
though our lab was at the far end of 
the grounds, they were in and out 
all day demanding directions to the 
‘Pavilion of Popsies”, no less. 
When the astrology woman from 
BTV floated in 1 gave up for the 
day. 



‘Do you know what a palimpsest 
is, boy?’ 

The student, startled, said, ‘An 
ancient piece of writing. Why do 
you ask?’ 

‘An ancient scrap that has been 
partly erased, and written over,’ the 
older man amplified. 

‘If Anstruther had made a DNA 
palimpsest of the cell he cloned, 
our project was redundant. He 
must already know how to control 
genetic memory patterns and we 
were wasting our time. But he 
hadn’t concelled us; and he had 
said I could read his records. I had 
to know how much control he’d had 
over that cloning cell seventeen 
years before. 

As I pushed my way across to the 
Pavilion — surely all these arms and 
legs did not belong to reporters? — I 
realized the monumental tempta- 
tion facing the Director at this mo- 
ment. Already he might have be- 
come entangled with a public con- 
struction, in which truth could 
easily get lost. 

‘The way in to the Pavilion was 
blocked by two fellows in uniforms. 
An army van was parked by the 
gate. 1 was stopped and searched in 
spite of my ID card. Finally a call 
was placed to Anstruther, who was 
understandably annoyed at the 
interruption of his interview. 

1 had got in to the building. Now 
I was at a loss. It was obviously not 
the time to ask for those records. 
The hall was marvelously quiet 
after the uproar outside. I

wandered down a corridor carpeted 
in white. It ended in a low archway, 
opening into a room whose contrast 
to the rest of the Institute was pro- 
found. Not a room, a chamber. The 
walls were hung with silk paint- 
ings . Complex thoughts; these 
must have been priceless, and by 
state order belonged in museums; 
dawning recognition that here was 
where they belonged, in this place 
designed for the Nyen-Hwas; a be- 
lated decision that they must be 
high-quality plastic replicas after 
all. Deep reddish drapes hung from 
the ceiling, not against the walls 
but at symmetrical positions in the 
room, gathered into cylindrical 
bunches and tied with cut velvet 
ribbons at intervals. The windows 
were elaborately leaded. 

‘“Please remove the shoes in the 
Ming T’ang.” She emerged from 
behind one of the curtain-pillars, 
golden. 

‘“I’m sorry,” 1 said, feeling at a 
heavy disadvantage as 1 bent over 
clumsily to remove the offensive 
shoes, which now seemed incredibly 
gross, and which I had no place to 
hide. “Er — excuse me,” I retreated 
to the doorway, holding the shoes. I 
was already a discourteous intruder 
in that place. 

“‘Please do not go,” she said. 
“Will you tell me what all the un- 
usual noise is? I can’t see from my 
windows.” 

“‘There are a lot of people who 
are curious about you . where 
are the others?” 



“‘1 am here,” she said, with faint 
edge of surprise. 

‘They were all there, now that I 
looked again. 

“‘Why are they curious about 
me?” said one. 

“‘You are rather different from 
them, ” I said helplessly. 

‘“Yes.” 

“‘So they’re curious.” 

“‘What are they like?” I wonder- 
ed how they managed to speak one 
at a time; then realized that they 
must be used to anticipating and 
deciding. 

“‘Well, like people are, all differ- 
ent.’ That sounded lame even to 
me. 1 tried again. “You’re very un- 
usual. Most of the rest of us have 
experiences in common that you 
haven’t shared. And we don’t any 
of us think exactly alike. You 
haven’t lived like ordinary people.” 

“‘But that is as it should be.” 

“‘Of course, but, well, the others 
are curious.” 

‘There was laughter. “Are you 
also curious?” 

“‘1 — yes.” 

“‘Please be seated.” There were 
low cushions, without backrests. 
We sat — one of us with cracking 
knees. “1 have curiosity as well. 
Stan-tzu cannot explain. I was born 
here; I know everyone around me 
and have always lived in this place. 
Why do 1 find it strange?” 

‘1 stared. “1 don’t know. It’s 
aphoristic, we feel at ease with what 
we know.” 

“I am easier now in this room. It

is nearer right than any of the 
others. Yet 1 have only just begun 
to dress it.” 

‘“Who looks after you?” I was 
getting accustomed to their alter- 
nate use of the singular pronoun. 

‘“There are many — Mariji has 
always been here, Stan-tzu, oh, 
many others. I have teachers. They 
do not understand either.” 

“‘Do you go out?” 

“‘Sometimes. But the car dis- 
quiets me.” 

‘The Institute car was a luxury — 
private cars were a thing of the 
past. Cars disquieted me, too. I 
said as much. They smiled, wel- 
coming even this small bond. I 
knew how small it was but — oh, 
god. The smile incandesced their 
faces until they seemed surrounded 
by a cloud of fire which ignited and 
spread through me to my genitals. 1 
felt my face burning. They went on 
smiling. 1 couldn’t get up, nor stay 
where 1 was; 1 closed my feverish 
eyes and struggled for some sort of 
calm. “A clone,” I thought. 
“A-homogenetic-clone-incubated- 
in-isolation-a-breakthrough-scien- 
tit'ic-experiment — ” Like Kim’s 
multiplication table, the jargon 
came to my rescue. 

‘When 1 looked again, they also 
had closed eyes and had dropped 
into meditation. All at once they 
emerged from it and rejoined me. 

“‘Stan-tzu does not know how to 
do that.” they said. “Nor anyone 
else here ... 1 thought I was the 
only one.” 



‘Through my precarious calm, I 
managed to say, “Anstruther grew 
up before it was taught. It’s part of 
our schooling now.” 

‘A sigh of sheer satisfaction. I 
said, “Tell me about this room. 
What did you call it?” 

“‘1 call it the Ming T’ang. I don’t 
know why. It seems right. It has 
eight windows. There should be 
pillars here, and here,” they indi- 
cated the cascades of drapery, “but 
we didn’t know that was what we 
wanted until we had made these.” 
“‘But how did you know?” 

‘An expression of perplexity 
flashed over the perfect faces. “I 
just know. The pictures are not 
right; but when I asked for some 
Chinese paintings they went to a 
great deal of trouble to get them, 
and 1 couldn’t say they were wrong. 
Please, don’t mention it to Stan- 
tzu. It would distress him. He al- 
ways wants to please me.” 

“‘But what’s the matter with 
them? They are very fine.” 

’“Yes, but there’s something . 
they are so — complicated? Sophis- 
ticated, too graceful. 1 remember 
that wall paintings should be more 
definite . The horses are very 
nice.” 

‘The horses were T’ang repro- 
ductions. 

“‘You remember v/a\\ paintings? 
Where did you see them? In the In- 
stitute?” 

“‘No, how could I? I don’t know. 
Sometimes 1 remember things I 
cannot possibly remember . .” 



THE PERSISTENCE OF MEMORY

Two voices overlapped. 

‘My heart beat a bit faster. 1 had 
recriminated the mice for their in- 
ability to speak. I must get those 
records. 

‘Gently, I asked, “What else do 
you remember?” 

‘“It’s so hard, like trying to recall 
a dream . there are bits here 
and there. It’s much easier to point 
out what feels right when we see 
it . .” It was disturbing. As they 
spoke of this the soft voices sepa- 
rated, as if the clone were losing its 
rapport. For some reason this made 
Nyen-Hwa more accessible. Again I 
was aware of the scent of musk . 
and now there was fear, disintegra- 
tion intermingled. 

“‘Does this frighten you?” I said 
aloud. 

“‘It is Stan-tzu. He is afraid. He 
doesn’t understand.” 

‘There was something here of im- 
portance. My mind was churning 
with tenderness, passion and 
curiosity. They were so goddam 
beautiful. 

“‘1 will try to understand. 
Stan-tzu knows a great deal about 
you; if there is something he 
doesn’t know 1 can try to find it 
out.” The troubled faces smoothed 
and they smiled again, relieved. 
A hand touched my arm; the others 
had reached to me and withdrawn, 
as if sensing that so many touches 
would be too much for me. 

“‘1 thank you.” Slowly, two of 
them slid to their feet. “Will you 
take tea?” 



“I had the feeling it would be 
rude to decline, as bad as the shoes. 
We waited in friendly silence while 
a glazed pot was prepared and tiny 
handleless cups appeared on a tray. 
The tea was overperfumed for me, 
but surprisingly refreshing. Or 
perhaps it was the company. When 
1 took my leave, they bowed, once 
more distant, serene and intact. 



T here was a moment of silence. 

Then the student murmured 
something. 

‘What?’ 

‘1 said. So that’s what they were 
like, the first one.’ 

‘1 can’t begin to tell you what 
they were like. They were so pure, 
so remote — it was something to do 
with being a clone.’ 

‘1 know.’ 

‘You can’t possibly. You couldn’t 
have met them.’ 

The boy laughed. ‘Did you think 
Nyen-Hwa was the only one?’ 

‘Of course, she was unique — 
what?’ Light flashed on the lenses 
as the man jerked. His mouth 
opened slowly, a fleshrimmed hole 
in the patchy beard. 

‘Oh, old Anstruther had several 
clones under way before he 
stopped,’ said the student. ‘We 
were the last — there are thirty of 
us . we’re not so pure and re- 
mote, though.’ He snickered. ‘But I 
do know what you mean. Ordinary 
people look all sort of strung out to 
us . anyway. Go on with your 



90 



GALAXY 




story.’ He offered the filled cup. 
The professor drank deeply. As if 
hypnotized, he said, ‘Thirty. 
that man never knew when to stop.’ 
‘1 told you we are the last. He 
knew. His work’s done.’ 

4 rr«HE day after I had visited 
X Nyen-Hwa I went to see him. 

I didn’t get a chance to ask any- 
thing. Before I could open my 
mouth he said, “Did you see the 
rV program?” He was so filled 
with pride; 1 couldn’t deny him his 
big moment. 

‘1 said, “You were great. Never 
heard anything described so 
clearly.” 1 didn’t say, so incom- 
pletely. 

‘“I’ve devoted all my life to this 
project, Ric ... all the stuff I 
couldn’t say — the cows’ uteri; the 
accidents; all those Institute docu- 
mentaries when we had to keep this 
quiet; the staff problems . the 
girls already have a film offer, how 
about that?” 

‘Appalled, 1 said, “You’re not 
going to . .” 

‘“Don’t be an ass, of course 
not.” He leaned toward me. “Soon- 
er or later they’ll have to find their 
way in the world, but not yet. Not 
till the noise dies down.” 

“‘But what will they do?” 

“‘They don’t have to do any- 
thing; they exist. That’s enough.” 
‘“Enough for you, Anstruther- 
san; but for them?” 

‘He shrugged. “They won’t be in 
want. They’ve been trained here. 



they can stay on. Or get married or 
something. They’ll be okay.” 

‘1 wasn’t satisfied. He didn’t 
seem to have given any serious 
thought to their future. I pictured 
them seeking helplessly for their 
“right” frame in our erratic world, 
and shivered. Anstruther’s next re- 
mark pushed the picture to the 
back of my mind. He spoke in a 
voice taut with suppressed greed. 

“‘Ric, they’ve said something 
about the Peace Prize. For the In- 
stitute, of course.” As I looked at 
him, 1 could see the tide of pub- 
licity rising around him, and knew 
that before long he would be im- 
prisoned by image-makers. He was 
susceptible. The first kiss of public 
attention had roused his appetite. 
Sure, he deserved recognition; but 
in that moment I lost all my awe of 
the man, and despised him. 

‘So I grew up a little. In my dis- 
appointment I resolved to stand by 
the girls. Their putative father had 
forgotten them, as human beings. I 
would take their welfare to myself, 
somehow. If my interest was a com- 
bination of lust, scientific fascina- 
tion and esthetics then so be it. 
Even then 1 knew that love isn’t an 
element but a compound. 

‘1 asked for the records. 

“‘Oh, yes. Sorry, Ric, they’ve 
been put under security.” 

“‘But you said I could see them!” 
“‘Oh, I have nothing to do with 
it. Board’s decision.” 

‘That was one code long broken. 
The “Board” suddenly surfaced

when an unpopular decision had to 
be made. Now those files would be 
locked in the computer by a key 
that would effectively keep my 
hands off, unless . 

‘I left the office thinking furious- 
ly. I was no engineer. The tech staff 
was rotated so often I never had the 
chance to scrape an acquaintance 
among them. 

‘The Pavilion receptionist knew 
me by sight. It didn’t get me any 
closer to the records but it did keep 
me in touch with Nyen-Hwa. I visit- 
ed them every day. I brought pic- 
tures of Chinese things. 

‘We began with art treasures 
OF THE EAST, expensive illustra- 
tions and sloppy one-sentence text; 
then, THE ART OF CHINA, better 
commentary, not-quite-so-elegant 
pictures; and we ended with A dis- 
quisition ON ESTHETOMETRIC 
COMPARISONS OF IDEOGRAPHIC 
DEVELOPMENT IN CONNECTION 
WITH EQUINE REPRESENTATIONS 
1200 B.c. TO SIX DYNASTIES, whose 
old flat photos came in a separate 
folder. Among them was a rather 
uninspired bronze animal which 
had been lost in a plane crash of the 
eighties. She wept over it. It had 
been “right”. She/they were im- 
pressed, amused, admiring of the 
T’ang horses and the Ming pottery, 
but those were not the same. Only 
objects dated before about 250 
A.D. had that certain quality of 
recognition. 

‘1 acquired a taste for scented 
tea. And I lay awake nights, my 



head a carousel of thicknecked 
horses, electrons whirling around a 
nucleus of yearning, bridled with 
polypeptide chains, spinning 
around and around the grinning 
carnival face of Anstruther to the 
zithery music of the ch’in. 

‘Nothing succeeds like a court- 
ship when the suitor is committed 
to solving a problem for his be- 
loved. You’d think it would be per- 
fect, wouldn’t you? What a 
romantic dream . there 1 was, 
head over heels in love, my sweet- 
heart’s eyes alight at my footstep, 
all of us counting the long slow 
seconds of separation . 

‘Five sweethearts, inextricably 
one, inhabiting five exquisite 
hungry virgin bodies . 

‘What would you do? I imagined 
things . oh, how I imagined. My 
imagination tangled me in confu- 
sions. Suppose my capacities ex- 
tended only to three, or worse, 
four? How could 1 be sure whether 
or not I had actually, er, made it 
with all of them, or missed out one? 
And how close were they really to 
each other — close enough to feel 
one another’s sensations? For all I 
knew I might be providing five 
times as much as I’d get — 1 squash- 
ed that ungenerous thought. I alter- 
nated between a hot conviction that 
I could easily satisfy all of them, 
and a cold feeling that I couldn’t 
possibly hope to. 1 couldn’t really 
understand them, not ever. Yet 
when we were together there were 
no doubts. We were in love . 1

didn’t dare start anything at all. I 
didn’t know how. 

‘And every day I tried a new 
attack on the locked records. An- 
struther had moved his office to the 
PR department next to the Pa- 
vilion. He spent his time offering 
titbits to the Press. I buttered him 
like any flack in order to obtain 
small pleasures for my love. We 
managed to mount an expedition to 
an exhibit of Chinese art. By the 
time he had set up his complicated 
security measures the show was 
about to move on; but at last we did 
get there in privacy. The girls came 
home in a state of intense nostalgia. 
There had been some lacquer 
boxes . 

‘Then Anstruther left for a week, 
to collect his Peace Prize. There- 
after he was inaccessible. 

‘I got a new batch of mice. I went 
through the motions of analysis, 
blindly recording the usual murky 
information revealed by the micro- 
scopes, filing the records some- 
where. The whole program had lost 
its impetus; we had no director. 

‘Finally 1 just let the system run 
on and devoted my whole attention 
to the Nyen-Hwa records. It hit me 
suddenly; suppose Anstruther had 
placed that bar across the records 
in the computer without planning 
in advance? He wasn’t really regu- 
lation-minded. That night he had 
been a little drunk; he had intro- 
duced me to the girls ... he had 
been triumphantly preoccupied 
with success, the night before his 



first Press announcement. Suppose 
he had thought up the locking code 
on the spur of that moment? . 
Success meant “five”. On impulse I 
worked out the five-root of five; the 
computer hesitated. I knew I’d got 
it. I fed in that number and “Nyen- 
Hwa”, and the screen lit up. So 
simple, so obvious ... I cursed 
myself for the weeks of stupidity. 

‘. In 1986 liver cells contri- 
buted by living donors, Chinese 
and American, had been de-differ- 
entiated to the embryonic cell 
needed to reconstruct the whole or- 
ganism. There had been occasional 
efforts at human cloning earlier, all 
failed. There was public reluc- 
tance, the equipment needed was 
prodigious, and nobody had been 
able to establish at what stage of 
cell division it would work. When 
the Institute was founded, An- 
struther got it all together for the 
first time. 

‘They had allowed the first cell to 
divide, parted the resulting pair. 
Six hours later, one of the four new 
cells had been removed and killed 
for inspection, leaving three in cul- 
ture. By the sixth division fifteen 
single cells remained, and these 
were cultured through to embryo. 
Only five had reached their full 
development. 

‘The chromosomatic records 
were all there. Had they been inter- 
preted? If so, why were we still fool- 
ing around with identifying 
memory components? I turned 
back to the beginning, to the cell

drawn at random from anonymous 
donors . 

4 TT wasn’t all that random;’ 

J ‘What do you know about it?’ 
said the professor irritably. 

‘We’ve had a lot of time to check 
things,’ said the boy. ‘Naturally, 
we’ve been curious about ourselves, 
and the others. The Nyen-Hwa cell 
came from a Chinese girl in the lab; 
her family had lived in Hunan — 
that’s the place they have discover- 
ed the Han tombs, all those jaded 
ancestors.’ 

‘So that’s what they remember- 
ed. and yourselves?’ 

‘Oh, we’re Italians. We weren’t 
supposed to know, but we have 
ways ... we started with one of the 
Maintenance Cadre.’ 

‘I see.’ The pipe had long since 
gone out. The professor began to 
clean it. The student watched the 
process with distaste. 

‘You’re making a bit of a mess, 
aren’t you?’ As the man looked up, 
he noticed the open notebook for 
the first time. 

‘What are you taking down?’ he 
said nervously. ‘This is all in the In- 
stitute records.’ 

‘Not quite all,’ said the boy. ‘I’m 
just making some notes.’ He smiled 
reassuringly. ‘It’s much easier to 
understand when you tell it — we 
don’t learn much biological nota- 
tion in the Political Science depart- 
ment. You don’t need to worry 
about a thing. Go on, what about 
the chromosomes?’ 



‘I don’t need notes to remember 
the next part. It’s a lot of dates 
stuck to my mind. 

‘Chromosome 17 was as familiar 
and enigmatic as ever. It wasn’t dif- 
ferent from others I’d seen in any 
way. The JCN presented me with all 
the details of that first cell, models 
of the chromosomes made from the 
holographs taken at the time ... I 
went on to the divisions. II had 
taken place on 27 May; III, at 2:30 
the next morning; IV six hours 
later; V, seven hours after that. Of 
course the records were a few 
minutes older, allowing time for 
slides to be processed. But near 
enough ... by Division VI I was 
seeing spots that weren’t there, and 
Chromosome 17 had shown no 
signs of anything. 

‘I set up the JCN to do some finer 
inspections, and left the lab. It was 
after 0500. 1 was still groggy when I 
went to my love in the afternoon. 

“‘Ric, how tired you look,’ she 
said, and led me to my cushion. I 
forgot that it had no back, and 
leaned, and sprawled in a heap. 
They exclaimed, and were all 
around me asking, “Oh, are you 
hurt? 1 am so sorry . .’’ Soft arms 
touched me, embraced me. 
Remember, I’d had no sleep and 
worked all night. I forgot every- 
thing; 1 held a warm body in my 
arms at last, and caressed her . 
I was lost. 

‘1 don’t remember the rest ... if 
1 do remember I will never tell it. 
Never.’

He dropped his head in his hands 
and was quiet. The student watch- 
ed, and refilled the cup. The pro- 
fessor pulled himself upright after a 
few minutes. 



‘1 awoke there, in the Ming 
T’ang, alone. I have never been so 
alone. There was no sound, only a 
faint dawn light through the tiny 
windowpanes. I knelt there, 
stricken. What had I done? What 
colossal arrogance had led me 
here? 1 had nothing to offer them, 
nothing. Can you understand? 
They were unique, precious, vul- 
nerable. I had failed them. I had 
known how little I understood and 
barged in, unthinking . .’ 

The student interrupted. ‘But I 
thought permissiveness had been 
around a while even then. Why all 
the fuss?’ 

The older man shook his head 
sadly. ‘You haven’t understood at 
all. They were different. They 
hadn’t grown up with the rest of us; 
the only men they knew were An- 
struther and me. When you invoke 
the power of sex things happen to 
people.” 

‘Well, what happened?’ 

‘1 was afraid to visit them 
again . They sent for me. Then I 
was afraid not to visit. 

‘1 made my way to the Ming 
T’ang in a state of panic. They ran 
to greet me; they kissed me. All my 



fear disappeared. I only loved 
them . and then they spoke. 

‘One said, “Ric.” Another said, 
“You are beautiful.” Another said, 
“We love you.” All at the same 
time. 

‘They had changed. They were 
out of synch. 

‘They smiled, and one was 
dreamy, another merry. They 
moved, drawing me into the room, 
and misjudged each other’s move- 
ments, and laughed. 

“‘Why didn’t you come to us yes- 
terday?” “We wanted to see you!” 
“We”, not “I”. 

‘They seemed quite happy. My 
fear returned. I could see so much 
further than they. I was older and 
experienced. I knew I had broken 
something irreparable. I stumbled 
through an explanation of my ab- 
sence — I had been very tired, I had 
been working on the problem — they 
accepted, without satisfaction. 

‘Politely, one of them said, “Tell 
us” — us! — “what you have found. I 
said something, 1 don’t know what. 

“‘It will take a long time to find 
out?” 

‘“I’m afraid so.” 

“‘We have plenty of time.” 

‘“Yes.” Did they? I was con- 
scious of Anstruther, of guilt, of 
time running out. I explained that I 
thought I ought to concentrate on 
the work. They clearly felt they had 
disappointed me. I couldn’t tell 
them about my terror of precipi- 
tating a row in the Institute; nor 
that 1 could see the gentle pattern

of their days falling into chaos, be- 
cause of me. 

‘1 fled. 

‘A few colleagues sat around in 
the lab, drinking tea, gossiping. 
Someone said hello in a desultory 
way and offered me a cup. To my 
surprise my hands shook too much 
to hold it. 1 retreated to my desk, 
closing my ears to the chatter. The 
troubles of the others were dim and 
uncomplicated, they only had to 
worry about their own futures. 

‘In my absence the computer had 
constructed a series of schematic 
models of the chromosome divisions 
of the Nyen-Hwa cell ... .1 wonder- 
ed which of those mysterious 
helices contained beauty, and 
quickly turned back to biology. 
Molecular diagrams were displayed 
on the screen. 1 tried to concen- 
trate . the helix hovered, section 
by section, twisting before me . 
rings of cytosine, guanine, adenine, 
thymine, parting and rejoining with 
the sugar bases, bonded by atoms 
of hydrogen and oxygen . the 
beginnings of my ruined love . 
Division 1, 11, III, IV . what? 
Something had happened at 
Division III. 

‘The bonding pattern had alter- 
ed ... a flicker in the image had 
caught my eye. 1 brought the pic- 
ture in closer, and watched. One 
hydrogen atom of one molecule of 
cytosine had dropped out of its nor- 
mal position, and moved down the 
molecule; thereafter the chain of 
that DNA had bonded askew. 



thymine to guanine instead of to 
adenine . .’ 

The student’s stylus was moving 
slowly. His eyes were glazing 
slightly. ‘You don’t know what I’m 
talking about.’ said the man. 

‘You’d best tell it your own way,’ 
said the boy. ‘I’ll manage.’ 

^^-*7HAT I didn’t know was 
VV whether this freaked-out 
chromosome had anything to do 
with Nyen-Hwa’s freaked out 
memory. I had to induce the 
change in a cell culture of my own, 
and then test it on a specimen . 
1 tried. I clobbered a cell with 
x-rays, and it died. I tried gamma 
radiation, expecting the same. It 
died. 1 bombarded it with sound 
and ultrasound and infrasound, 
and it died. But something must 
have caused it . 

‘Finally 1 got from the JCN a re- 
port on all the experiments of the 
dates in question, in the whole In- 
stitute. On the 27th there had been 
a telemetry project involving micro- 
waves. I tried microwaves. Nothing. 
Culture terminated. There had 
been a series of brain-acupuncture 
tests; no use at all. There had been 
some magnetographic measure- 
ment of a point on the 212-day 
solar cycle. There had been a 
new- — and unsuccessful — staining 
test in the pathology lab. I went 
back to look at the solar experi- 
ments, without much conviction;

but the time was right. The sunspot 
cycle, blah, blah, microvariable 
star . human pulse rate related 
to the cycle . so? The instru- 
ment had detected magnetic waves, 
a perfectly ordinary part of the 
cosmic background, as expected. 
Blah, blah. 

‘But there was a footnote I’d 
missed the first time. For one nano- 
second the clocks had stopped. 
There was a memo directing better 
shielding on the magnetograph to 
prevent its acting as an amplifier. 
Too much depended on accurate 
time measurement in the Institute 
to risk clock trouble. 

‘Well, I had nothing to lose. I set 
up the computer to run nano- 
second-stop tests on the slides I’d 
prepared, subjecting them to 
various intensities of magnetic 
fields with the laser-magnet. 

‘It only took a week. 

‘At the right strength, at the pre- 
cise second in the chromosome divi- 
sion, that same hydrogen atom 
reacted to the magnet by reversing 
its spin, drifting away from its nit- 
rogen bond and moving into the 
new position as the field released 
it . 

‘What does a wild mouse know 
that a lab mouse does not? I didn’t 
want to mess with dietetics; the 
field mouse knows of dangers that 
the lab mouse has had thousands of 
generations of forgetting. Lab mice 
ignore cats. In the archives I found 
a recording of the European wood- 
lands at night, made in the days 



when it was still possible to pick up , 
the sounds of nocturnal creatures 
going about their business; wind, 
the gnurr of hedgehog, the lower 
range of bat squeaks ... I was 
alone in the lab when I played the 
recording to the three litters of mice 
1 had prepared for this. 

‘Fourteen young ones, and their 
mothers. Nine of them continued 
their usual scuffling as the strange 
little sounds echoed in the room. 
Then, an owl hooted. Five small 
mice jerked high in the air and 
dived for cover under the placid 
dam. 

‘Axiom: DNA allows for infinite 
variation within its perimeters. 
Some times — at the coincidence of 
the reproduction of a certain twist 
in a helix with a peak of a solar 
cycle; some how — by the exposure 
of a dividing cell to a tiny increase 
in the magnetic field; and a 
memory of a previous existence is 
evoked ... A man almost recalls a 
past he never lived. Scraps and 
bits, patched with learned history, 
and he is convinced he is a reincar- 
nation. He can be called a fraud, 
but he will not believe it. It is 
enough that the pattern be re- 
peated, to haunt the mind. Some- 
where in the genetic history of that 
man that same pattern existed 
before, and he almost remembers. 
The Ming T’ang “felt right’’. 

‘And would it continue? Would 
those people’s children remem- 
ber?”

The man finally lit the pipe 
again. ‘No; how could they? When 
the chain parted again, it would re- 
sume the normal bonding. The only 
way it could happen would be by 
cloning.’ He dropped the pipe 
suddenly. ‘Oh my god.’ 

The boy sighed. ‘You have told 
me several important things.’ 

Slowly, painfully, the professor 
said, ‘I have given you the events of 
my life. 1 suppose that is of no im- 
portance.’ 

‘Only to you . but we had not 
realized . several things. What 
happened to the girls?’ 

‘1 went to the Ming T’ang. Tea 
was ready. 

“‘We’ve been waiting every day.” 
“Oh, dear Ric, how good to see 
you.” There was no absolution 
here. They took no offense. 

And they did not inquire about 
the problem. They had lost 
interest. They had turned to the 
future, away from the past, how- 
ever mysterious. They spoke of 
jobs, of meeting new people, of me, 
tenderly; 1 had become a memory.’ 

The professor fell silent. The 
student said, ‘Is that the end of the 
story?’ 

‘It’s the end of my story.’ 

‘But what happened to your dis- 
covery? And why did you quit the 
Institute?’ 

‘Because I couldn’t bear to stay 
there . Nyen-Hwa; they took 



names of their own, and moved 
on ... 1 resigned. What good was 
my discovery? I knew how to pro- 
voke a random memory of a 
random ancestor in one* creature; 
what use is that? I knew no more 
about memory than I did before. A 
complete waste of time. I quit the 
whole scene ... I had lost my love, 

1 had discovered with great effort 
an irrelevant phenomenon. An- 
struther went on with his cloning 
games. 

‘1 was tired ... So I teach ele- 
mentary biology. It’s an existence.’ 

The student said, ‘1 thank you, 
sir. You have told me one thing of 
vital importance to us. We had not 
realized that we must remain celi- 
bate ... we wouldn’t be likely to 
have guessed it.’ The young face 
took on an expression that chilled 
the professor; the word “obscene” 
crossed his mind. Staring, he said, 
‘What did you say your.name was?’ 

The student rose, and bowed. He 
picked up the bill, and blinked at 
it. ‘The world is in an odd position, 
as are we all . I’ll give you the 
name we call ourselves.’ He 
scribbled a signature on the note- 
pad, ripped it out, and handed it to 
the tired man. ‘Again, we thank 
you,’ he said, and tossing his jacket 
over his shoulder, swiftly crossed 
the room. The door swung to 
behind him. 

The professor picked up the 
scrap of paper. The signature was 
bold and clear: Machiavelli (Venti- 
quattro). ¥

Tou CAN go a thousand kays 
^ any direction there and 
there’s nothing to see but the 
wheat,” said the brown man to the 
other tankers and the woman. His 
hair was deep chestnut, his face 
and hands burnt umber from the 
sun of Emporion the month before 
and the suns of seven other worlds 
in past years. He was twenty-five 
but looked several years older. The 
sleeves of his khaki coveralls were 
slipped down over his wrists against 
the chill of the breeze that had be- 
gun at twilight to feather the hill- 
crest. “We fed four planets from 
Dunstan — Hagener, Weststar, Mi- 
rage, and Jackson’s Glade. And out 
of it we made enough to replace the 
tractors when they wore out, maybe 
something left over for a bit of 
pretty. A necklace of fireballs to set 
off a Lord’s Day dress, till the 
charge drained six, eight months 
later. A static cleaner from Hage- 
ner, it was one year, never quite 
worked off our powerplant however 
much we tinkered with it . 

“My mother, she wore out too. 
Dad just kept grinding on, guess he 
still does.” 

The girl asked a question from 
the shelter of the tank’s scarred 
curtain. Her voice was too mild for 
the wind’s tumbling, her accent 
that of Thrush and strange to the 
tanker’s ears. But Danny answered, 
“Hate them? Oh, I know about the 
Combine, now, that the four of 
them kept other merchants off 
Dunstan to freeze the price at what 



they thought to pay. But Via, 
wheat’s a high bulk cargo, there’s 
no way at all we’d have gotten rich 
on what it could bring over ninety 
minutes’ transit. And why shouldn’t 
1 thank Weststar? If ever a world 
did me well, it was that one.” 

He spat, turning his head with 
the wind and lofting the gobbet in- 
visibly into the darkness. The lamp 
trembled on its base, an overturned 
ration box. The glare skippered 
across the rusted steel skirts of the 
tank, the iridium armor of hull and 
turret; the faces of the men and the 
woman listening to the blower cap- 
tain. The main gun, half shadowed 
by the curve of the hull, poked out 
into the night like a ghost of itself. 
Even with no human in the tank, at 
the whisper of a relay in Command 
Central the fat weapon would light 
the world cyan and smash to lava 
anything within line of sight of its 
muzzle. 

“We sold our wheat to a West- 
star agent, a Hindi named Sarim 
who’d lived. Via, twenty years at 
least on Dunstan but he still 
smelled funny. Sweetish, sort of; 
you know? But his people were all 
back in Ongole on Weststar. When 
the fighting started between the 
Scots and the Hindi settlers, he 
raised a battalion of farm boys like 
me and shipped us over in the hold 
of a freighter. Hoo Lordy, that was 
a transit! 

“And 1 never looked back. 
Colonel Hammer docked in on the 
same day with the Regiment, and 



100 



GALAXY 




he took us all on spec. Six years, 
now, that’s seven standard . and 
not all of us could stand the gaff, 
and not all who could wanted to. 
But 1 never looked back, and I 
never will.” 

From the mast of Command 
Central, a flag popped unseen in 
the wind. It bore a red lion ram- 
pant on a field of gold, the emblem 
of Hammer’s Slammers; the 
banner of the toughest regiment 
that ever killed for a dollar. 

44 Y l-QTEL, Kitchen, Mama, 

J^move to the front in com- 
pany columns and advance.” 

The tiny adamantine glitter 
winking on the hilltop ten kays dis- 
tant was the first break in the land- 
scape since the Regiment had 
entered the hypothetical war zone, 
the Star Plain of Thrush. It 
warmed Pritchard in the bubble at 
the same time it tightened his 
muscles. “Goose it, Kowie,” he 
ordered his driver in turn, “they 
want us panzers up front. Bet it’s 
about to drop in the pot?” 

Kowie said nothing, but the big 
blower responded with a howl and a 
billow of friable soil that seethed 
from under the ground effect cur- 
tain. Two Star in the lead, H Com- 
pany threaded its way in line ahead 
through the grounded combat cars 
and a battalion from Infantry Sec- 
tion. The pongoes crouched on 
their one-man skimmers, watching 
the tanks. One blew an ironic kiss 
to Danny in Two Star’s bubble. 



Moving parallel to Hotel, the other 
companies of Tank Section, K and 
M, advanced through the center 
and right of the skirmish line. 

The four man crew of a combat 
car nodded unsmilingly from their 
open-topped vehicle as Two Star 
boomed past. A trio of swivel- 
mounted powerguns, 2 cm hoses 
like the one on Danny’s bubble, 
gave them respectable firepower; 
and their armor, a sandwich of 
steel and iridium, was in fact ade- 
quate against most hand weapons. 
Buzzbombs aside, and tankers 
didn’t like to think about those 
either. But Danny would have 
fought reassignment to combat cars 
if anybody had suggested it — Lord, 
you may as well dance in your skin 
for all the good that hull does you 
in a firefight! And few car crewmen" 
would be caught dead on a 
panzer — or rather, were sure that 
was how they would be caught if 
they crewed one of those sluggish, 
clumsy, blind-sided behemoths. In- 
fantry Section scorned both, know- 
ing how the blowers drew fire but 
couldn’t flatten in the dirt when it 
dropped in on them. 

One thing wouldn’t get you an 
argument, though: when it was 
ready to drop in the pot, you sent in 
the heavies. And nothing on the 
Way would stop the Tank Section 
of Hammer’s Slammers when it got 
cranked up to move. 

Even its 170 tonnes could not 
fully dampen the vibration of Two 
Star’s fans at max load. The oval 



THE BUTCHER’S BILL 



101 




hull, all silvery-smooth above but of 
gouged and rusty steel below where 
the skirts fell sheer almost to the 
ground, slid its way through the 
grass like a boat through yellow 
seas. They were dropping into a 
swale before they reached the up- 
grade. From the increasing rank- 
ness of the vegetation that flattened 
before and beside the tank, Prit- 
chard suspected they would find a 
meandering stream at the bottom. 
The brow of the hill cut off sight of 
the unnatural glitter visible from a 
distance. In silhouette against the 
pale bronze sky writhed instead a 
grove of gnarled trees. 

“Incoming, fourteen seconds to 
impact,” Command Central 
blatted. A siren in the near distance 
underscored the words. “Three 
rounds only.” 

The watercourse was there. Two 
Star’s fans blasted its surface into a 
fine mist as the tank bellowed over 
it. Danny cocked his powergun, 
throwing a cylinder of glossy black 
plastic into the lowest of the three 
rotating barrels. There was shriek- 
ing overhead. 

WHAM 

A poplar shape of dirt and black 
vapor spouted a kay to the rear, 
among the grounded infantry. 

WHAM WHAM 

They were detonating under- 
ground. Thrush didn’t have much 
of an industrial base, the rebel por- 
tions least of all. Either they hadn’t 
the plant to build proximity fuses at 
all, or they were substituting inter- 



ference coils for miniature radar 
sets, and there was too little metal 
in the infantry’s gear to set off the 
charges. 

“Tank Section, hose 'down the 
ridge as you advance, they got an 
OP there somewhere.” 

“Incoming, three more in four- 
teen.” The satellite net could pick 
up a golf ball in flight, much less a 
four hundred pound shell. 

Pritchard grinned like a death’s 
head, laying his 2 cm automatic on 
the rim of the hill and squeezing 
off. The motor whirred, spinning 
the barrels as rock and vegetation 
burst in the blue-green sleet. Spent 
cases, gray and porous, spun out of 
the mechanism in a jet of coolant 
gas. They bounced on the turret 
slope, some clinging to the iridium 
to cool there, ugly dark excrescences 
on the metal. 

“Outgoing.” 

Simultaneously with .Central’s 
laconic warning, giants tore a strip 
off the sky. The rebel shells 
dropped but their bursts were 
smothered in the roar of the Regi- 
ment’s own rocket howitzers boost- 
ing charges to titanic velocity for 
the seven seconds before their 
motors burned out. Ten meters 
from the muzzles the rockets went 
supersonic, punctuating the ripping 
sound with thunderous slaps. 
Danny swung his hose toward the 
grove of trees, the only landmark 
visible on the hilltop. His burst 
laced it cyan. Water, flash-heated 
within the boles by the gunfire. 



102 



GALAXY 




blew the dense wood apart in blasts 
of steam and splinters. A dozen 
other guns joined Pritchard’s, claw- 
ing at rock, air, and the remaining 
scraps of vegetation. 

“Dead on,” Central snapped to 
the artillery. “Now give it battery 
five and we’ll show those freaks 
how they should’ve done it.” 

Kowie hadn’t buttoned up. His 
head stuck up from the driver’s 
hatch, trusting his eyes rather than 
the vision blocks built into his com- 
partment. The tanks themselves 
were creations of the highest tech- 
nical competence, built on Terra it- 
self; but the crews were generally 
from frontier worlds, claustro- 
phobic in an armored coffin no 
matter how good its electronic re- 
'ceptors were. Danny knew the feel- 
ing. His hatch, too, was open, and 
his hand gripped the rounded 
metal of the powergun itself rather 
than the selsyn unit inside. They 
were climbing sharply now, the 
back end hopping and skittering as 
the driver fed more juice to the rear 
fans in trying to level the vehicle. 
The bow skirts grounded briefly, 
the blades spitting out a section of 
hillside as pebbles. 

For nearly a minute the sky 
slammed and raved. Slender, 
clipped-off vapor trails of counter- 
battery fire streamed from the 
defiladed artillery. Half a minute 
after they ceased fire, the drumbeat 
of shells bursting on the rebels con- 
tinued. No further incoming 
rounds fell. 



Two Star lurched over the rim of 
the hill. Seconds later the lead 
blowers of K and M bucked in turn 
onto the flatter area. Smoke and 
ash from the gun-lit brushfire 
shoomped out in their downdrafts. 
There was no sign of the enemy, 
either Densonite rebels or Foster’s 
crew — though if the mercenaries 
were involved, they would be bunk- 
ered beyond probable notice until 
they popped the cork themselves. 

“Tank Section, ground! Ground 
in place and prepare for director 
control.” 

Danny hunched, bracing his 
palms against the hatch coaming, 
inside the turret the movement and 
firing controls of the main gun 
glowed red, indicating that they 
had been locked out of Pritchard’s 
command. Kowie lifted the tow to 
kill the tank’s immense inertia. 
There was always something 
spooky about feeling the turret purr 
beneath you, watching the big gun 
snuffle the air with deadly precision 
on its own. Danny gripped his tri- 
barrel. scanning the horizon ner- 
vously. It was worst when you 
didn’t know what Central had on 
its mind . and you did know 
that the primary fire control com- 
puter was on the fritz — they always 
picked the damnedest times! 

“Six aircraft approaching from 
two-eight-three degrees,” Central 
mumbled. “Distance seven point 
ought four kays, closing at one one 
ought ought.” 

Pritchard risked a quick look 



THE BUTCHER’S BILL 



103 




away from where the gun pointed 
toward a ridgeline northwest of 
them, an undistinguished swelling 
half-obscured by the heat-wavering 
pall of smoke. Thirteen other tanks 
had crested the hill before Central 
froze them, all aiming in the same 
direction. Danny dropped below 
his hatch rim, counting seconds. 

The sky roared cyan. The tank’s 
vision blocks blanked momentarily, 
but the dazzle reflected through the 
open hatch was enough to make 
Pritchard’s skin tingle. The smoke 
waved and rippled about the super- 
heated tracks of gunfire. The hori- 
zon to the northwest was an ex- 
panding orange dome that silently 
dominated the sky. 

“Resume advance.” Then, 
“Spectroanalysis indicates five hos- 
tiles were loaded with chemical ex- 
plosives, one was carrying fission- 
ables.” 

Danny was trembling worse than 
before the botched attack. The 
briefing cubes had said the Den- 
sonites were religious nuts, sure. 
But to use unsupported artillery 
against a force whose satellite 
spotters would finger the guns be- 
fore the first salvo landed; air- 
craft — probably converted cargo 
haulers — thrown against director- 
controlled powerguns that shot 
light swift and line straight; and 
then nukes, against a regiment 
more likely to advance stark naked 
than without a nuclear-damper up! 
They weren’t just nuts — Thrush 
central government was that, un- 



willing to have any of its own people 
join the fighting — they were as 
crazy as if they thought they could 
breathe vacuum and live. You 
didn’t play that sort of game with 
the Regiment. 

They’d laager for the night on 
the hilltop, the rest of the outfit 
rumbling in through the afternoon 
and early evening hours. At day- 
break they’d leapfrog forward 
again, deeper into the Star Plain, 
closer to whatever it was the Den- 
sonites wanted to hold. Sooner or 
later, the rebels and Foster’s Infan- 
try — a good outfit but not good 
enough for this job — were going to 
have to make a stand. And then the 
Regiment would go out for contact 
again, because they’d have run out 
of work on Thrush. 



^ he’ll be in looking for you 
pretty soon, won’t she, 
handsome?” 

“Two bits to stay.” 

“Check. Sure, Danny-boy, you 
Romeos from Dunstant, you can 
pick up a slot anywhere, huh?” 

A troop of combat cars whined 
past, headed for their position in 
the laager. Pritchard’s hole card, a 
jack, flipped over. He swore, 
pushed in his hand. “1 was folding 
anyway. And cut it out, will you? I 
didn’t go looking for her, I didn’t 
tell her to come back. And she may 
as well be the Colonel for all my 
chance of putting her flat.” 

Wanatamba, the lean, black

Terran who drove Fourteen, laugh- 
ed and pointed. A gold-spangled 
skimmer was dropping from the 
east, tracked by the guns of two of 
the blowers on that side. Everybody 
knew what it was, though. Prit- 
chard grimaced and stood. “Seems 
that's the game for me,” he said. 

“Hey Danny,” one of the men 
behind him called as he walked 
away. “Get a little extra for us, 
hey?” 

The skimmer had landed in front 
of Command Central, at rest an 
earth-blended geodesic housing the 
staff and much of the commo hard- 
ware. Wearing a wrist-to-ankle 
sunsuit, yellow where it had tone, 
she was leaning on the plex wind- 
screen. An officer in fatigues with 
unlatched body armor stepped out 
of the dome and did a double take. 
He must have recollected, though, 
because he trotted off toward a 
bunker before Danny reached the 
skimmer. 

“Hey!” the girl called brightly. 
She looked about seventeen, her 
hair an unreal cascade of beryl 
copper over one shoulder. “We’re 
going on a trip.” 

“Uh?” 

The dome section flipped open 
again. Pritchard stiffened to atten- 
tion when he saw the short, mus- 
tached figure who exited. “Peace, 
Colonel,” the girl said. 

“Peace, Sonna. You’re such an 
ornament to a firebase that I’m 
thinking of putting you on requisi- 
tion for our next contract.” 



Laughing cheerfully, the girl ges- 
tured toward the rigid sergeant. 
“I’m taking Danny to the Hamper 
Shrine this afternoon.” 

Pritchard reddened. “Sir, Ser- 
geant-Commander Daniel Prit- 
chard- — ” 

“1 know you, trooper,” the 
Colonel said with a friendly smile. 
“I’ve watched Two Star in action 
often enough, you know.” His eyes 
were blue. 

“Sir, 1 didn’t request — that 
is . .” 

“And 1 also know there’s small 
point in arguing with our girl, here, 
hey Sonna? Go see your shrine, 
soldier, and worst comes to worst, 
just throw your hands up and yell 
‘Exchange.’ You can try Col. 
Foster’s rations for a week or two 
until we get this little business 
straightened out.” The Colonel 
winked, bowed low to Sonna, and 
reentered the dome. 

“1 don’t figure it,” Danny said as 
he settled into the passenger seat. 
The skimmer was built low and 
sleek as if a racer, though its top 
speed was probably under a hun- 
dred kays. Any more would have 
put too rapid a drain of the re- 
chargables packed into the deci- 
meter-thick floor — a fusion unit 
would have doubled the flyer’s bulk 
and added 400 kilos right off the 
bat. At that, the speed and an 
operating altitude of thirty meters 
were more than enough for the 
tanker. You judge things by what 
you’re used to, and the blower cap-

tain who found himself that far 
above the cold, hard ground — h 
could happen on a narrow switch- 
back — had seen his last action. 

While the wind whipped noisily 
about the open cockpit the girl 
tended to her flying and ignored 
Danny’s curiosity. It was a hop 
rather than a real flight, keeping 
over the same hill at all times and 
circling down to land scarcely a 
minute after takeoff. On a field of 
grass untouched by the recent fire 
rose the multi-tented crystalline 
structure Pritchard had glimpsed 
during the assault. With a neat 
spin and a brief whine from the 
fans, the skimmer settled down. 

Sonna grinned. Her sunsuit, 
opaquing completely in the direct 
light, blurred her outline in a 
dazzle of fluorescent saffron. 
“What don’t you figure?” 
“Well, ah . .” Danny stum- 
bled, his curiosity drawn between 
the girl and the building. "Well, 
the Colonel isn’t that, ah, easy to 
deal with usually. 1 mean . .” 

Her laugh bubbled in the sun- 
shine. “Oh, it’s because I’m an Ad- 
visor, I’m sure.” 

“Excuse?” 

“An Advisor. You know, 
the . well, a representative. Of 
the government, if you want to put 
it that way.” 

“My Lord!” the soldier gasped. 
“But you’re so young.” 

She frowned. “You really don’t 
know much about us, do you?” she 
reflected . 



“Umm, well, the briefing cubes 
mostly didn’t deal with the friend- 
lies this time because we’d be 
operating without support . 
Anything was going to look good 
after Emporion, that was for sure. 
All desert there — you should’ve 
heard the cheers when the Colonel 
said that we’d lift.” 

She combed a hand back ab- 
sently through her hair. It flowed 
like molten bronze. “You won on 
Emporion?” she asked. 

“We could’ve,” Danny explain- 
ed, “even though it was really a 
Lord-stricken place, dust and for- 
tified plateaus and lousy recce be- 
sides because the government only 
had two operating spacers. But the 
Monarchists ran out of money after 
six months and that’s one sure rule 
for Hammer’s Slammers — no pay, 
no play. Colonel yanked their bond 
so fast their ears rang. And we 
hadn’t orbited before offers started 
coming in.” 

“And you took ours and came to 
a place you didn’t know much 
about,” the girl mused. “Well, we 
didn’t know much about you 
either.” 

“What do you need to know ex- 
cept we can bust anybody else in 
this business?” the soldier said with 
amusement. “Anybody, public or 
planet-tied. If you’re worried about 
Foster, don’t; he wouldn’t back the 
freaks today, but when he has to, 
we’ll eat him for breakfast.” 

“Has to?” the girl repeated in 
puzzlement. “But he always has 



106 



GALAXY 




to — the Densonites hired him, 
didn’t they?” 

Strategy was a long way from 
Danny’s training, but the girl 
seemed not to know that. And be- 
sides, you couldn’t spend seven 
years with the Slammers and not 
pick up some basics. “OK,” he be- 
gan, “Foster’s boys’ll fight, but 
they’re not crazy. Trying to block 
our advance in open land like this’d 
be pure suicide — as those coppy 
freaks — pardon, didn’t mean 
that — must of found out today. 
Foster likely got orders to support 
the civvies but refused. 1 know for a 
fact that his arty’s better’n what we 
wiped up today, and those 
planes ...” 

“But his contract . .?” Sonna 
queried. 

“Sets out the objectives and says 
the outfit’ll obey ciwie orders 
where it won’t screw things up too 
bad.” Danny said. “Standard 
form. The legal of it’s different, but 
that’s what it means.” 

The girl was nodding, eyes 
slitted, and in a low voice she 
quoted, “. .‘except in circum- 
stances where such directions 
would significantly increase the 
risks to be undergone by the party 
of the second part without corres- 
ponding military advantage.’” She 
looked full at Danny. “Very . 
interesting. When we hired your 
colonel, I don’t think any of us 
understood that clause.” 

Danny blinked, out of his depth 
and aware of it. “Well, it doesn’t 



matter really. I mean, the Colonel 
didn’t get his rep from ducking 
fights. It’s just, well . say we’re 
supposed to clear the Densonites 
off the, the Star Plain? Right?” 
The girl shrugged. 

“So that’s what we’ll do.” Danny 
wiped his palms before gesturing 
with both hands. “But if your Ad- 
visors — ” 

“We Advisors,” the girl cor- 
rected, smiling. 

“Anyway,” the tanker conclud- 
ed, his enthusiasm chilled, “if you 
tell the Colonel to fly the whole 
Regiment up to ten thousand and 
jump it out, he’ll tell you to go piss 
up a rope. Sorry, he wouldn’t say 
that. But you know what I mean. 
We know our job, don’t worry.” 
“Yes, that’s true,” she said 
agreeably. “And we don’t, and we 
can’t understand it. We thought 
that — one to one, you know? — per- 
haps if 1 got to know you, one of 
you . They thought we might 
understand all of you a little.” 

The soldier frowned uncertainly. 
“What we don’t see,” she finally 
said, “is how you — ” 

She caught herself. Touching her 
cold fingertips to the backs of the 
tanker’s wrists, the girl continued, 
“Danny, you’re a nice . you’re 
not a, a sort of monster like we 
thought you all must be. If you’d 
been born of Thrush you’d have 
had a — different — education, you’d 
be more, forgive me, 1 don’t mean 
it as an insult, sophisticated in 
some ways. That’s all. 



THE BUTCHER’S BILL 



107 




“But how can a nice person like 
you go out and kill?” 

He rubbed his eyes, then laced 
together his long, brown fingers. 
“You . well, it’s not like that. 
What 1 said the other night — look, 
the Slammers’re a good outfit, the 
best, and I’m damned lucky to be 
with them. 1 do my job the best way 
1 know. I’ll keep on doing that. 
And if somebody gets killed, OK. 
My brother Jig stayed home and 
he’s two years dead now. Tractor 
rolled on a wet field but Via, coulda 
been a tow-chain snapped or old 
age; doesn’t matter. He wasn’t 
going to live forever and neither is 
anybody else. And I haven’t got any 
friends on the far end of the 
muzzle.” 

Her voice was very soft as she 
said, “Perhaps if 1 keep try- 
ing . .” 

Danny smiled. “Well, 1 don’t 
mind,” he lied, looking at the 
structure. “What is this place, any- 
how?” 

Close up, it had unsuspected de- 
tail. The sides were a hedge of 
glassy rods curving together to a 
series of peaks ten meters high. No 
finger-slim member was quite the 
thickness or color of any other, al- 
though the delicacy was subliminal 
in impact. In ground plan it was a 
complex oval thirty meters by ten, 
pierced by scores of doorways 
which were not closed off but were 
foggy to look at. 

“What do you think of it?” the 
girl asked. 



“Well, it’s . .” Danny tempo- 
rized. A fragment of the briefing 
cubes returned to him. “It’s one of 
the alien, the Gedel, artifacts, isn’t 
it?” 

“Of course,” the girl agreed. 
"Seven hundred thousand years 
old, as far as we can judge. Only a 
world in stasis, like Thrush, would 
have let it survive the way it has. 
The walls are far tougher than they 
look, but seventy millenia of earth- 
quakes and volcanoes . .” 

Danny stepped out of the 
skimmer and let his hand run 
across the building’s cool surface. 
“Yeah, if they’d picked some place 
with a hotter core there wouldn’t be 
much left but sand by now, would 
there?” 

“Pick it? Thrush was their 
home,” Sonna’s voice rang smooth- 
ly behind him. “The Gedel chilled 
it themselves to make it suitable, to 
leave a signpost for the next races 
following the Way. We can’t even 
imagine how they did it, but there’s 
no question but that Thrush was 
normally tectonic up until the last 
million years or so.” 

“Via!” Danny breathed, turning 
his shocked face toward the girl. 
“No wonder those coppy fanatics 
wanted to control this place. Why, 
if they could figure out just a few of 
the Gedel tricks they’d . Lord, 
they wouldn’t stop with Thrush, 
that’s for sure.” 

“You still don’t understand,” 
the girl said. She took Danny by the 
hand and drew him toward the 



108

nearest of the misty doorways. 
“The Densonites have, well, quirks 
that make them hard for the rest of 
us on Thrush to understand. But 
they would no more pervert Gedel 
wisdom to warfare than you would, 
oh, spit on your colonel. Come 
here.” 

She stepped into the fuzziness 
and disappeared. The tanker had 
no choice but to follow or break her 
grip; though, oddly, she was no 
longer clinging to him on the other 
side of the barrier. She was not 
even beside him in the large room. 
He was alone at the first of a line of 
tableaux, staring at a group of 
horribly inhuman creatures at play. 
Their sharp-edged faces, scale- 
dusted but more avian than reptile, 
stared enraptured at one of their 
number who hung in the air. The 
acrobat's bare, claw-tipped legs 
pointed 180° apart, straight toward 
ground and sky. 

Pritchard blinked and moved on. 
The next scene was only a dazzle of 
sunlight in a glade whose foliage 
w as redder than that of Thrush or 
Dunstan. There was something 
else, something wrong or strange 
about the tableau. Danny felt it, 
but his eyes could not explain. 

Step by step, cautiously, Prit- 
chard worked his way down the line 
of exhibits. Each was different, 
centered on a group of the alien 
bipeds or a ruddy, seemingly empty 
landscape that hinted unintelli- 
gibly. At first, Danny had noticed 
the eerie silence inside the hall. As

he approached the far end he 
realized he was conscious of music 
of some sort, very crisp and distant. 
He laid his bare palm on the floor 
and found, as he had feared, that it 
did not vibrate in the least. He ran 
the last twenty steps to plunge out 
into the sunlight. Sonna still 
gripped his hand, and they stood 
outside the doorway they had 
entered . 

The girl released him. “Isn’t it 
incredible?” she asked, her expres- 
sion bright. “And every one of the 
doorways leads to a different cor- 
ridor — recreation there, agriculture 
in another, history — everything. A 
whole planet in that little build- 
ing.” 

“That’s what the Gedel looked 
like, huh?” Danny said. He shook 
his head to clear the strangeness 
from it. 

“The Gedel? Oh, no,” the girl 
replied, surprised again at his ig- 
norance. “These were the folk we 
call the Hampers. No way to pro- 
nounce their own language, a man 
named Hamper found this site is 
all. But their homeworld was Ka- 
linga IV, almost three days transit 
from Thrush. The shrine is here, 
we think, in the same relation to 
Starhome as Kalinga was to 
Thrush. 

“You still don’t understand,” 
she concluded aloud, watching 
Danny’s expression. She sat on the 
edge of the flyer, crossing her 
hands on the lap of her sunsuit. In 
the glitter thrown by the structure 



the fabric patterned oddly across 
her lithe torso. “The Gedel associa- 
tion — it wasn’t an empire, couldn’t 
have been. But to merge, a group 
ultimately needs a center, physical 
and intellectual. And Thrush and 
the Gedel were that for twenty 
races. 

“And they achieved genuine 
unity, not just within one race but 
among all of them, each as strange 
to the others as any one of them 
would have been to man, to us. 
The . power that gave them, 
over themselves as well as the uni- 
verse, was incredible. This — even 
.Starhome itself — is such a tiny part 
of what could be achieved by per- 
fect peace and empathy.” 

Danny looked at the crystal 
dome and shivered at what it had 
done to him. “Look,” he said, 
“peace is just great if the universe 
cooperates. I don’t mean just my 
line of work, but it doesn’t happen 
that way in the real world. There’s 
no peace spending your life beating 
wheat out of Dunstan, not like I’d 
call peace. And what’s happened to 
the Gedel and their buddies for the 
last half million years or so if things 
were so great?” 

“We can’t even imagine what 
happened to them,” Sonna ex- 
plained gently, “but it wasn’t the 
disaster you imagine. When they 
reached what they wanted, they set 
up this, Starhome, the other 
eighteen shrines as . monu- 
ments. And then they went away, 
all together. But they’re not wholly 



110 



GALAXY 




gone, even from here, you know. 
Didn’t you feel them in the back- 
ground inside, laughing with you?” 

“1 . Danny attempted. He 
moved, less toward the skimmer 
than away from the massive crystal 
behind him. “Yeah, there was 
something. That’s what you’re 
fighting for?” 

You couldn’t see the laager from 
where the skimmer rested, but 
Danny could imagine the silvery 
glitter of tanks and combat cars be- 
tween the sky and the raw yellow 
grass. Her eyes fixed on the same 
stretch of horizon, the girl said, 
“Someday men will be able to walk 
through Starhome and understand. 
You can’t live on Thrush without 
feeling the impact of the Gedel. 
That impact has . warped, per- 
haps, the Densonites. They have 
some beliefs about the Gedel that 
most of us don’t agree with. And 
they’re actually willing to use force 
to prevent the artifacts from being 
defiled by anyone who doesn’t be- 
lieve as they do.” 

“Well, you people do a better job 
of using force,” Danny said harsh- 
ly. His mind braced itself on its 
memory of the Regiment’s prickly 
hedgehog. 

“Oh. not us!” the girl gasped. 

Suddenly angry, the tanker ges- 
tured toward the unseen firebase. 
“Not you? The Densonites don’t 
pay us. And if force isn’t what hap- 
pened to those silly bastards today 
when our counter-battery hit them. 
I’d like to know what is.” 



She looked at him in a way that, 
despite her previous curiosity, was 
new to him. “There’s much that I’ll 
have to discuss with the other Ad- 
visors,” she said after a long pause. 
“And I don’t know that it will stop 
with us, we’ll have to put out the 
call to everyone, the Densonites as 
well if they will come.” Her eyes 
caught Danny’s squarely again. 
“We acted with little time for de- 
liberation when the Densonites 
hired Col. Foster and turned all the 
other pilgrims out of the Star Plain. 
And we acted in an area beyond our 
practice — thank the Lord! The key 
to understanding the Gedel and 
joining them. Lord willing and the 
Way being short, is Starhome. And 
nothing that blocks any man, all 
men, from Starhome can be . 
tolerated. But with what we’ve 
learned since . well, we have 
other things to take into account.” 

She broke off, tossed her 
stunning hair. In the flat evening 
sunlight her garment had paled to 
translucence. The late rays licked 
her body red and orange. “But now 
I’d better get you back to your 
colonel.” She slipped into the 
skimmer. 

Danny boarded without hesita- 
tion. After the Gedel building, the 
transparent skimmer felt almost 
comfortable. “Back to my tank,” 
he corrected lightly. “Colonel may 
not care where I am, but he damn 
well cares if Two Star is combat 
ready.” The sudden rush of air cut 
off thought of further conversation. 



THE BUTCHER’S BILL 



111 




and though Sonna smiled as she 
landed Danny beside his blower, 
there was a blankness in her expres- 
sion that indicated her thoughts 
were far away. 

Hell with her, Danny thought. 
His last night in the Rec Center on 
Emporion seemed a long time in 
the past. 

AT THREE in the morning the Regi- 
/\ ment was almost 200 kilo- 
meters from the camp they had 
abandoned at midnight. There had 
been no warning, only the low hoot 
of the siren followed by the 
Colonel’s voice rasping from every 
man’s lapel speaker, “Mount up 
and move, boys. Order seven, and 
your guides are set.” It might have 
loomed before another outfit as a 
sudden catastrophe. After docking 
one trip with the Slammers, 
though, a greenie learned that 
everything not secured to his blower 
had better be secured to him. Col. 
Hammer thought an armored regi- 
ment’s firepower was less of an as- 
set than its mobility. He used the 
latter to the full with ten preset 
orders of march and in-motion re- 
charging for the infantry skimmers, 
juicing from the tanks and combat 
cars. 

Four pongoes were jumpered to 
Two Star when Foster’s outpost 
sprang its ambush. 

The lead combat car, half a kay 
ahead, bloomed in a huge white 
ball that flooded the photon ampli- 
fiers of Danny’s goggles. The buzz- 



bomb’s hollow detonation followed 
a moment later while the tanker, 
cursing, simultaneously switched to 
infra-red and swung his turret left 
at max advance. He ignored the 
head of the column, where the 
heated-air thump of powerguns 
merged with the crackle of bomb- 
lets kicked to either side by the 
combat cars; that was somebody 
else’s responsibility. He ignored the 
two infantrymen wired to his tank’s 
port side as well. If they knew their 
business, they’d drop the jumpers 
and flit for Two Star’s blind side as 
swiftly as Danny could spin his 
heavy turret. If not, well, you don’t 
have time for niceness when some- 
body’s firing shaped charges at 
you. 

“Damp that ground-sender!” 
Central snapped to the lead ele- 
ments. Too quickly to be a response 
to the command, the grass trem- 
bled under the impact of a delay- 
fused rocket punching down 
toward the computed- location of 
the enemy’s subsurface signaling. 
The Regiment must have rolled 
directly over an outpost, either 
through horrendously bad luck or 
because Foster had sewn his ve- 
dettes very thickly. 

The firing stopped. The column 
had never slowed and Mama, first 
of the heavy companies behind the 
screen of combat cars, fanned the 
grass fires set by the hoses. Prit- 
chard scanned the area of the fire- 
fight as Two Star rumbled through 
it in turn. The antipersonal bomb- 



112 



GALAXY 




lets had dimpled the ground where 
they hit, easily identifiable among 
the glassy scars left by the power- 
guns. In the center of a great vitri- 
fied blotch lay a left arm and a few 
scraps of gray coverall. Nearby was 
the plastic hilt of a buzzbomb 
launcher. The other vedette had 
presumably stayed on the commo 
in his covered foxhole until the 
penetrator had scattered it and him 
over the landscape. If there had 
been a third bunker, it escaped 
notice by Two Star’s echo sounders. 

“Move it out, up front,” Central 
demanded. “This cuts our margin.” 
The burned-out combat car 
swept back into obscurity as Kowie 
put on speed. The frontal surfaces 
had collapsed inward from the 
heat, leaving the driver and blower 
captain as husks of carbon. There 
was no sign of the wing gunners. 
Perhaps they had been far enough 
back and clear of the spurt of di- 
rected radiance to escape. The 
ammo canister of the port tri-barrel 
had flash-ignited, though, and it 
was more likely that the men were 
wasted on the floor of the vehicle. 

Another hundred and fifty kays 
to go, and now Foster and the Den- 
sonites knew they were coming. 

T here were no further ambushes 
to break the lightless monotony 
of gently rolling grassland. Prit- 
chard took occasional sips of water 
and ate half a tube of protein 
ration. He started to fling the tube 
aside, then thought of the metal de- 



tectors on following units. He 
dropped it between his feet instead. 

The metal-pale sun was thrusting 
the Regiment’s shadow in long fin- 
gers up the final hillside when Cen- 
tral spoke again. You could tell it 
was the Colonel himself sending. 
“Everybody freeze but Beta-First, 
Beta-First proceed in column up 
the rise and in. Keep your intervals, 
boys, and don’t try to bite off too 
much. Last data we got was Foster 
had his anti-aircraft company with 
infantry support holding the target. 
Maybe they pulled out when we 
knocked on the door tonight, 
maybe they got reinforced. So take 
it easy — and don’t bust up anything 
you don’t have to.” 

Pritchard dropped his seat back 
inside the turret. There was 
nothing to be seen from the hatch 
but the monochrome sunrise and 
armored vehicles grounded on the 
yellow background. Inside, the 
three vision blocks gave greater 
variety. One was the constant 360° 
display, better than normal eye- 
sight according to the designers be- 
cause the blower captain could see 
all around the tank without turning 
his head. Danny didn’t care for it. 
Images were squeezed a good deal 
horizontally. Shapes weren’t quite 
what you expected, so you didn’t 
react quite as fast; and that was a 
good recipe for a dead trooper. The 
screen above the three-sixty was 
variable in light sensitivity and in 
magnification, useful for special il- 
lumination and first-shot hits. 



THE BUTCHER’S BILL 



113 




The bottom screen was the re- 
mote rig; Pritchard dialed it for the 
forward receptors of Beta-First- 
Three. It was strange to watch the 
images of the two leading combat 
cars trembling as they crested the 
hill, yet feel Two Star as stable as 
170 tonnes can be even when 
grounded. 

“Nothing moving,” the second 
leader reported unnecessarily. Cen- 
tral had remote circuits too, as well 
as the satellite net to depend on. 

The screen lurched as the blower 
Danny was slaved to boosted its 
fans to level the down-grade. Dust 
plumed from the leading cars, 
weaving across a sky that was al- 
most fully light. At an unheard 
command, the section turned up 
the wick in unison and let the cars 
hurtle straight toward the target’s 
central corridor. It must have help- 
ed, because Foster’s gunners 
caught only one car when they 
loosed the first blast through their 
camouflage. 

The second car blurred in a mist 
of vaporized armor plate. Incred- 
ibly, the right wing gunner shot 
back. The deadly flame-lash of his 
hose was pale against the richer 
color of the hostile fire. Foster had 
sited his calliopes, massive 3 cm 
guns whose nine fixed barrels fired 
extra-length charges. Danny had 
never seen a combat car turned into 
Swiss cheese faster than the one 
spiked on the muzzles of a pair of 
the heavy guns. 

Gray-suited figures were darting 



from cover as if the cars’ auto- 
matics were harmless for being out- 
classed. The damaged blower 
nosed into the ground. Its driver 
leaped out, running for the lead car 
which had spun on its axis and was 
hosing blue-green fire in three di- 
rections. One of Foster’s troops 
raised upright, loosing a buzzbomb 
at the wreckage of the grounded 
car. The left side of the vehicle 
flapped like a batwing as it sailed 
across Danny’s field of view. The 
concussion knocked down the 
running man. He rose to his knees, 
jumped for a handhold as the lead 
car accelerated past him. As he 
swung himself aboard, two buzz- 
bombs hit the blower simultan- 
eously. It bloomed with joined 
skullcaps of pearl and bone. 

Pritchard was swearing softly. 
He had switched to a stern pickup 
already, and the tumbled wreckage 
in it was bouncing, fading swiftly. 
Shots twinkled briefly as the two es- 
caping blowers dropped over the 
ridge. 

“In column ahead,” said the 
Colonel grimly. “Hotel, Killer, 
Mama. Button up and hose’em 
out, you know the drill.” 

And then something went wrong. 
“Are you insane?” the radio mar- 
veled, and Danny recognized that 
voice too. “1 forbid you!” 

“You can’t. Somebody get her 
out of here.” 

“Your contract is over, finished., 
do you hear? Heavenly Way, we’ll 
all become Densonites if we must. 



114 



GALAXY 




This horror must end!” 

“Not yet. You don’t see — ” 

“I’ve seen too — ” The shouted 
words cut off. 

“So we let Foster give us a bloody 
nose and back off? That’s what you 
want? But it’s bigger than what you 
want now, sister, it’s the whole 
Regiment. It’s never bidding an- 
other contract without somebody 
saying, ‘Hey, they got sandbagged 
on Thrush, didn’t they?’ And no- 
body remembering that Foster 
figured the civvies would chill 
us — and he was right. Don’t you 
see? They killed my boys, and now 
they’re going to pay the bill. 

“Tank Section, execute! Dig’em 
out, panzers!” 

Danny palmed the panic bar, 
dropping the seat and locking the 
hatch over it. The rushing-air snarl 
of the fans was deadened out by the 
armor, but a hot bearing some- 
where filled the compartment with 
its high keening. Two Star hurdled 
the ridge. Its whole horizon flared 
with crystal dancing and scattering 
in sunlight and the reflected glory 
of automatic weapons firing from 
its shelter. Starhome was immense- 
ly larger than Danny had expected. 

A boulevard twenty meters wide 
divided two ranks of glassy build- 
ings, any one of which, towers and 
pavillions, stood larger than the 
shrine Danny had seen the previous 
day. At a kilometer’s distance it 
was a corruscating unity of parts as 
similar as the strands of a silken 
rope. Danny rapped up the magni-

fication and saw the details spring 
out; rods w'oven into columns that 
streaked skyward a hundred 
meters; translucent sheets formed 
of myriads of pinhead beads, each 
one glowing a color as different 
from the rest as one star is from the 
remainder of those seen on a moon- 
less night; a spiral column, free- 
standing and the thickness of a 
woman’s wrist, that pulsed slowly 
through the spectrum as it climbed 
almost out of sight. All the struc- 
tures seemed to front on the central 
corridor, with the buildings on 
either side welded together by 
tracery mazes, porticoes, arcades — 
a thousand different plates and 
poles of glass, 

A dashed cyan line joined the 
base of an upswept web of color to 
the tank. Two Star’s hull thudded

to the shock of vaporizing metal. 
The stabilizer locked the blower’s 
pitching out of Danny’s sight pic- 
ture. He swung the glowing orange 
bead onto the source of fire and 
kicked the pedal. The air rang like 
a carillon as the whole glassy facade 
sagged, then avalanched into the 
street. There was a shock of heat in 
the closed battle compartment as 
the breech flicked open and belch- 
ed out the spent case. The plastic 
hissed on the floor, outgassing hor- 
ribly while the air-conditioning 
strained to clear the chamber. 
Danny ignored the stench, nudged 
his sights onto the onrushing 
splendor of the second structure on 
the right of the corridor. The 
breech of the big powergun slapped 
again and again, recharging in- 
stantly as the tanker worked the 
foot trip. 

Blue-green lightning scattered 
between the walls as if the full 
power of each bolt was flashing the 
length of the corridor. Two Star 
bellowed in on the wake of its fire, 
and crystal flurried under the fans. 
Kowie leveled their stroke slightly, 
cutting speed by a fraction but lift- 
ing the tank higher above the 
abrasive litter. The draft hurled 
glittering shards across the corri- 
dor, arcs of cold fire in the light of 
Two Star's gun and those of the 
blowers following. Men in gray 
were running from their hiding 
places to avoid the sliding crystal 
masses, the iridescent rain that 
pattered on the upper surfaces of 



the tanks but smashed jaggedly 
through the infantry’s body armor. 

Danny set his left thumb to ro- 
tate the turret counter-clockwise, 
held the gun-switch down with his 
foot. The remaining sixteen rounds 
of his basic load blasted down the 
right half of Starhome, spread by 
the blower’s forward motion and 
the turret swing. The compartment 
was gray with fumes. Danny 
slammed the hatch open and 
leaned out. His hands went to the 2 
cm as naturally as a calf turns to 
milk. The wind was cold on his 
face. Kowie slewed the blower left 
to avoid the glassy wave that slash- 
ed into the corridor from one of the 
blasted structures. The scintillance 
halted, then ground a little further 
as something gave way inside the 
pile. 

A soldier in gray stepped from an 
untouched archway to the left. The 
buzzbomb on his shoulder was the 
size of a landing vessel as it swung 
directly at Danny. The tri-barrel 
seemed to traverse with glacial 
slowness. It was too slow. Danny 
saw the brief flash as the rocket 
leaped from the shoulder of the 
other mercenary. It whirred over 
Two Star and the sergeant, ex- 
ploded cataclysmically against a 
spike of Starhome still rising on the 
other side. 

The infantryman tossed the 
launcher tube aside. He froze, his 
arms spread wide, and shouted, 
“Exchange!" 

“Exchange yourself, mother!”

Danny screamed back white-faced. 
He triggered his hose. The gray 
torso exploded. The body fell back- 
ward in a mist of blood, chest and 
body armor torn open by four hits 
that shriveled bones and turned 
fluids to steam. 

“Hard left and goose it, Kowie,” 
the sergeant demanded. He slipped 
the panic bar again. As the hatch 
clanged shut over his head, Danny 
caught a momentary glimpse of the 
vision blocks, three soldiers with 
powerguns leaping out of the same 
towering structure from which the 
rocketeer had come. Their faces 
were blankly incredulous as they 
saw the huge blower swinging to- 
ward them at full power. The walls 
flexed briefly under the impact of 
the tank’s frontal slope, but the fili- 
gree was eggshell thin. The struc- 
ture disintegrated, lurching toward 
the corridor while Two Star plowed 
forward within it. A thousand 
images kaleidoscoped in Danny’s 
skull, sparkling within the wind- 
chime dissonance of the falling 
tower. 

The fans screamed as part of the 
structure’s mass collapsed onto 
Two Star. Kowie rocked the tank, 
raising it like a submarine through 
a sea of ravaged glass. The gentle, 
green-furred humanoids faded 
from Danny’s mind. He threw the 
hatch open. Kowie gunned the 
fans, reversing the blower in a poly- 
chrome shower. Several tanks had 
moved ahead of Two Star, nearing 
the far end of the corridor. Gray- 



uniformed soldiers straggled from 
the remaining structures, hands 
empty, eyes fixed on the ground. 
There was very little firing. Kowie 
edged into the column and followed 
the third tank into the laager form- 
ing on the other side of Starhome. 
Pritchard was drained. His throat 
was dry, but he knew from past ex- 
perience that he would vomit if he 
swallowed even a mouthful of water 
before his muscles stopped trem- 
bling. The blower rested with its 
skirts on the ground, its fans 
purring gently as they idled to a 
halt. 

Kowie climbed out of the driver’s 
hatch, moving stiffly. He had a 
powergun in his hand, a pistol he 
always carried for moral support. 
Two Star’s bow compartment was 
frequently nearer the enemy than 
anything else in Hammer’s 
Slammers. 

Several towers still stood in the 
wreckage of Starhome. The nearest 
one wavered from orange to red 
and back in the full blaze of sun- 
light. Danny watched it in the 
iridium mirror of his tank’s deck, 
the outline muted by the hatchwork 
of crystal etchings on the metal. 

Kowie shot off-hand. Danny 
looked up in irritation. The driver 
shot again, his light charge having 
no discernable effect on the struc- 
ture. 

“Shut it off,” Danny croaked. 
“These’re shrines.” 

The ground where Starhome had 
stood blazed like Hell. ★

SCIENCE FACT 



FARTHER 

OUT 



HERE COME THE BRAINS 

JERRY POURNELLE, Ph.D. 



R obots are a favorite science 
fiction theme. Another is the 
great computer, much smarter 
than a man, which one way or an- 
other takes over the world. Ma- 
chine intelligence fascinates us. 

Comparatively fewer stories deal 
with enhanced intelligence, mostly 
because that’s very hard work: how 
do you write about a character who 
is much smarter than you are? One 
theme I’ve been working on for two 
years involves implants: you take a 
small transceiver and put it into a 
human head (or elsewhere in the 
anatomy if you like), wiring up the 
output of the receiver into the audi- 
tory nerve. 

Now you have someone who can 
communicate by a kind of 
telepathy; let’s put a really big com- 
puter at the other end of the sys- 
tem. In theory, at least, every bit of 
information known to mankind will 
be instantly available to this 
“terminal man.” 

Dossiers; reference books; dic- 
tionaries; encyclopedias; all the 
data banks of the government, IRS 
files, etc. , can be his for the asking. 
A detective could get continuous 
information on the whereabouts of 



his colleagues on the force, or con- 
tinuous information about bur- 
glaries in progress, or whatever. 

There’d be more: all the mathe- 
matics capability of powerful com- 
puters would be available in real 
time. Solve integral equations in 
your head, calculus of finite mo- 
tion, stock market predictions, 
etc., all are instantly yours at a 
thoughts. 

It’s not all that far-fetched. I’ve 
spoken with both computer specia- 
lists and neurosurgeons who think 
the first use of gadgetry like that 
may very well come before the end 
of the century. The stumbling 
block at the moment involves the 
language you’d use to communicate 
with computers, and no one expects 
that to take too long to solve. Voice 
communication with a computer in 
ordinary English is probably com- 
ing within the decade (there are 
limited cases of that going on right 
now), and once that's available, 
comes first the walkie-talkie com- 
puter terminal, then the implant. 
Neither of those is beyond present 
state-of-the-art. 

Unfortunately, it’s very difficult 
to think like a man who has a 



118 





360/95 in his head, and my story 
has dragged a bit while 1 give this 
more thought. I don’t recall too 
many memorable stories in which 
real geniuses were the viewpoint 
characters, probably for the same 
reason I’m having trouble. Of the 
two that impressed me most. 
Flowers For Algernon and Ted 
.Sturgeon’s Maturity, the central 
character lost the genius ability be- 
fore the story ended. 

Still, if there’s a mental hookup 
to a computer in the future of some 
of the younger readers of this 
column — and there probably is — 
there’s another possibility also. A 
robot can be connected to the cen- 
tral brain, and of course there have 
been a lot of stories on that theme. 

All in all, it may not be long be- 
fore electronics gives us a number 
of very smart characters, both 
human and mechanical, to deal 
with, provided no one jams their 
data link-ups. 

T here’s another approach, 
though, that may be just as ex- 
citing: we may be on the way to real 
robots: self-contained, not relying 
on any kind of link with a central 
data bank although able to use one 
if it’s available; very strong; and 
capable of independent action if 
not thought. Again, the mechanics 
are simple enough. The robot itself 
could be constructed today. What's 
missing is the brain. 

The human brain weighs, on 



average, about 1.48 kilograms, or 
3-1/4 pounds, in the mature male. 
That little chunk of matter can 
store some one millon billion bits of 
information, which is quite a lot; 
the best computers don’t have any- 
thing approaching that capability, 
and they’re big. 

Computers are getting smaller all 
the time, of course; I remember 
back in the early fifties visiting the 
ILIAC at the University of Illinois, 
then the biggest computer in the 
world. It w'as housed in a gym- 
nasium-sized building with the 
world’s largest air-conditioner, and 
three undergraduates were employ- 
ed full-time running around in 
iliac’s innards to replace burned- 
out vacuum tubes. Nowadays you 
can get the old iliac’s memory 
capacity inside my desk. 

Still, with all the micro-chip 
technologies we have today, the 
human brain remains the most effi- 
cient data-storage system ever 
built. It isn’t as reliable as we’d like 
it to be, but it’s very good at pack- 
ing data into a small space and 
getting it back out quickly. 

It has another characteristic 
that’s very useful: the information 
doesn’t seem to be stored in any 
specific place. Karl Lashley, after 
30 years of work trying to find the 
engram — the exact site of any par- 
ticular memory — gave up. All of 
our memories seem to be stored all 
over our brains. 

That is: Lashley, and now others, 
train specific reflexes and memory 



119 




patterns into experimental animals, 
then extirpate portions of their 
brains. Take out a chunk here, or a 
chunk there: surely you’ll get. the 
place where the memory is stored if 
you keep trying, won’t you? 

No. Short of killing the animal, 
the memory remains, even when up 
to 90% of the cortical matter has 
been removed. Lashley once whim- 
sically told a conference that he’d 
just demonstrated that learning 
isn’t possible. 

The experiment has been dupli- 
cated a number of times, and the 
evidence of human subjects who’ve 
had brain damage as a result of ac- 
cidents confirms it: our various 
memories are stored, not in one 
specific place, but in a lot of places; 
literally, all over our cortices. 
That’s got to be a clue to how the 
brain works. 

A second characteristic of the 
brain is that it’s fast. Consider 
visual stimulation as an example. 
You see an unexpected object. You 
generally don’t have to stop to 
think what it is: a hammer, a 
saucer, a pretty girl, the Top Ser- 
geant, an ice cream cone, a saber- 
toothed tiger about to spring, or 
whatever; you just know, and know 
very quickly. 

Yet the brain had to take the im- 
pulses from the light pattern on the 
retina and do something with them. 
What? Introspection hints that a 
number of trial and error opera- 
tions were conducted: “test” 

patterns were compared with the 



stimulus object, until there was a 
close correspondence, and then the 
“aha!” signal was sent. If, some- 
how, the “aha!” was sent up for the 
wrong test pattern, it takes cons- 
cious effort to get rid of that and 
“see” the stimulus as it should be 
seen. 

We’re still trying to teach com- 
puters to recognize a small number 
of very precisely drawn patterns, 
yet yesterday I met a man I hadn’t 
seen for ten years and didn’t know 
well then, and recognized him in- 
stantly. Dogs and cats automati- 
cally do what we sweat blood to 
teach to computers. If only we 
could figure out how the brain does 
it . 

A number of neuro-scientists 
think they’ve found the proper ap- 
proach at last. It’s only a theory, 
and it may be all wrong, but there 
is now a lot of evidence that the 
human brain works like a holo- 
gram. Even if that isn’t how our in- 
ternal computer works, a holo- 
graphic computer could, at least in 
theory, store information as 
compactly and retrieve it as rapidly 
as the human brain, and thus make 
possible the self-contained robots 
dear to science fiction. 

T he first time Dr. David Good- 
man proposed the holographic 
brain model to me, 1 thought he’d 
lost his mind. Holograms I under- 
stood: you take a laser beam and 
shine part of it onto a photographic 
plate, while letting the rest fall on

an object and be reflected off the 
object onto the film. The result is a 
messy interference pattern on the 
film that, when illuminated with 
coherent light of the proper fre- 
quency, will reproduce an image of 
the object. Marvelous and all that, 
but there aren’t any laser beams in 
our heads. It didn’t make sense. 

Well, of course it does make 
sense. There’s no certainty that 
holography is the actual mechanism 
for memory storage in human be- 
ings, but we can show the 
mechanism the brain might use to 
do it that way. First, though, let’s 
look at some of the characteristics 
of holograms. 

They’ve been around a long time, 
to begin with, and they don’t need 
lasers. Lasers are merely a rather 
convenient (if you’re rich enough to 
afford them) source of very co- 
herent light. If you don’t have a 
laser, a monochromatic filter will 
do the job nicely, or you can use a 
slit, or both. 

A coherent light beam differs 
from ordinary light in the same way 
that a platoon of soldiers marching 
in step differs from a mob running 
onto the field after the football 
game. The light is all the same fre- 
quency (marching in step) and 
going in the same direction 
(parallel rays). Using any source of 
coherent light to make a hologram 
of a single point gives you a familiar 
enough thing: a Fresnel lens, which 
looks like a mess of concentric 
circles. Holography was around as

“lenseless photography” back 
before WW II. 

As soon as you have several 
points, the neat appearance 
vanishes, of course. A hologram of 
something complicated, such as 
several chessmen or a group of toy 
soldiers, is just a smeared film with 
strange patterns on it. 

Incidentally, you can buy holo- 
grams from Edmund Scientific or a 
number of other sources, and 
they’re fascinating things. I’ve even 
seen one of a watch with a magnify- 
ing glass in front of it. Because the 
whole image, from many view- 
points, is stored in the hologram, 
you can move your head around 
until you see the watch through the 
image of the magnifying glass — 
and then you can read the time. 
Otherwise the watch numerals are 
too small to see. 

Hmm. Our mental images have 
the property of viewpoint changes; 
we can recall them from a number 
of different angles. 

Another interesting property of 
holograms is that any significant 
part of the photographic plate con- 
tains the whole picture. If you want 
to give a friend a copy of your holo- 
gram, simply snip it in half; then 
you’ve both got one. He can do the 
same thing, of course, and so can 
the guy he gave his to. Eventually, 
when it gets small enough, the 
images become fuzzy; acuity and 
detail have been lost, but the whole 
image is still there. 

That sounds suspiciously like the 



results Lashley got with his brain 
experiments, and also like reports 
from soldiers with severe brain 
tissue losses: fuzzy memories, but 
all of them still there. (I’ll come 
back to that point and deal with 
aphasias and the like in a moment.) 

Holograms can also be used as 
recognition filters. Let us take a 
hologram of the word “Truth” for 
example, and view a page of print 
through it. Because the hologram is 
blurry, we can’t read the text: 
BUT, if the word “truth” is on that 
page, whether it’s standing alone or 
embedded in a longer word, you 
will see a very bright spot of light at 
the point where the word will be 
found when you remove the filter. 

The printed word can be quite 
different from the one used to make 
the hologram, by the way. Different 
type fonts can be employed, and 
the letters can be different sizes. 
The spot of light won’t be as bright 
or as sharp if the hologram was 
made from a type font different 
from the image examined, but it 
will still be there, because it’s the 
pattern that’s important. 

The Post Office is working on 
mail-sorting through use of this 
technique. Computers can be 
taught to recognize patterns this 
way. The police find it interesting 
too: you can set up a gadget to 
watch the freeways and scream 
when it sees a 1964 Buick, but ig- 
nore everything else; or examine 
license plates for a particular 
number.

GALAXY 




There’s another possibility. 
Cataracts are caused by cloudy 
lenses. If you could just manage to 
make a hologram of the cataracted 
lens, you could, at least in theory, 
give the sufferer a pair of glasses 
that would compensate for his cata- 
racts. That technique isn’t in the 
very near future, but it looks 
promising. 

You’ll have noticed that this 
property of holograms sounds a bit 
like the brain’s pattern-search 
when confronted with an unfamiliar 
object. A large number of test 
patterns can be examined 
“through” a hologram of the 
stimulus object, and one will stand 
out. 

Brain psysiologists have found 
another property of the brain that’s 
similar to a holographic computer. 
The brain appears to perform a 
Fourier transform on data present- 
ed to it; and holograms can be 
transmitted through Fourier-trans- 
form messages. 

A Fourier transform is a mathe- 
matical operation that takes a com- 
plex wave form, pattern, signals, or 
what have you, and breaks it down 
into a somewhat longer, but pre- 
cisely structured, signal of simpler 
frequences. If you have a very 
squiggly line, for example, it can be 
turned into a string of numbers and 
transmitted that way, then be re- 
constructed exactly. The brain ap- 
pears to make this kind of transfor- 
mation of data. 

Once a message (or image, or 



memory) is in Fourier format, it’s 
easy systematically to compare it 
with other messages, because it is 
patterned into a string of informa- 
tion; you have only to go through 
those whose first term is the same 
as your unknown, ignoring all the 
millions of others; then find those 
with similar second terms, etc., 
until you’ve located either the 
proper matching stored item, or 
one very close to it. If our memories 
are stored either in Fourier format 
or in a manner easily converted to 
that, we’ve a mechanism for the re- 
markable ability we have to 
recognize objects so swiftly. 

S o. It would be convenient if the 
brain could manufacture holo- 
grams; but can it, and does it? 

It can: that is, we can show a 
mechanism it could use to do it. 
Whether it does or not isn’t known, 
but there don’t appear to be any ex- 
periments that absolutely rule out 
the theory. 

There are rhythmic pulses in the 
brain that radiate from a small 
area: it’s a bit like watching ripples 
from a stone thrown into a pond. 
Waves or ripples of neurons firing 
at precise frequencies spread 
through the cerebrum. These, of 
course, correspond to the “laser” 
or coherent light source of a holo- 
gram. Beat them against incoming 
impulses and you get an electrical/ 
neuron-firing analog of a holo- 
gram. 

Just as you can store thousands 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



123 




of holograms on a single photo- 
graphic plate by using different fre- 
quences of coherent light for each 
one, so could the brain store mil- 
lions of billions of bits of informa- 
tion by using a number of different 
frequences and sources of “co- 
herent” neuron impulses. 

That model also makes some- 
thing else a bit less puzzling: selec- 
tive loss of memory. Older people 
often retain very sharp memories 
for long-past events, while losing 
the ability to remember more 
recent things; perhaps they’re 
losing the ability to come up with 
new coherent reference standards. 
Some amnesiacs recall nearly every- 
thing in great detail, yet can’t re- 
member specific blocks of their life: 
the loss or scrambling of certain 
“reference standards” would tend 
to cause en bloc memory losses 
without affecting other memories at 
all. 

Aphasias are often caused by 
specific brain-structure damage. I 
have met a man who can write any- 
thing he likes, including all his 
early memories; but he can’t talk. 
A brain injury caused him to “for- 
get” how. It’s terribly frustrating, 
of course. It’s also hard to explain, 
but if the brain uses holographic 
codes for information storage, then 
the encoder/decoder must survive 
for that information to be recover- 
ed. A sufficiently selective injury 
might well destroy one decoder 
while leaving another intact. 

In other words, the model fits a 



great deal of known data. Farther 
than that no one can go. The brain 
could use holograms. 

Not very long ago, Ted Sturgeon, 
A. E. van Vogt, and I were invited 
to speak to the Los Angeles 
Cryonics Society. That’s the outfit 
that arranges to have people quick- 
frozen and stored at the tempera- 
ture of liquid nitrogen in the hopes 
that someday they can be revived in 
a time when technology is suffi- 
ciently advanced to be able to cure 
whatever it was that killed them to 
begin with. 

1 chose to give my talk on the 
holographic brain model. The 
implications weren’t very encourag- 
ing for the Cryonics Society. 

If the brain uses holographic 
computer methods, then the infor- 
mation storage is probably dy- 
namic. not static; and even if a 
frozen man could be revived, since 
the electrical impulses would have 
been stopped, he’d have no memo- 
ries, and thus no personality. If the 
holographic brain model is a true 
picture, it’s goodbye to that par- 
ticular form of immortality. 

On the other hand, whether our 
ow'n brains use holograms or not, 
holographic computers almost un- 
doubtedly will work: and the holo- 
graphic information storage tech- 
nique offers us a way of construct 
those independent robots that 
figure so large in science fiction 
stories. Either way, it looks as if the 
big brains may be coming before 
the turn of the century.

PETER D. AMBROSE 



T he heat drilled into the back of 
Phillips’ neck. He could feel it 
boring into his brain like some ab- 
surd earwig. The notion struck him 
as somehow amusing and he smil- 
ed, tugging down the visor of his 
cap. Sweat and dirt had dulled the 
embroidered bullion into a sullied 
brown. Moisture beaded his upper 
lip and dripped from the peaks of 
his nose and brows. His lips crack- 
ed as he smiled and dried blood 
flaked onto his teeth. 

The smile filled with gritty brown 
sand and he spat, turning away 
from a capricious gust of desert 
wind. He stumbled down the sage- 
choked arroyo toward his craft. 

The eddy of wind moved across 
the cracking soil and he leaned for- 
ward, glancing at a distant horizon 
filled with blue mountains and gray 
clouds. 

He slid down to the sand beside 
his shattered vessel, studying his 
companion inside the darkened 
hull. 

“How’s it going?” he asked 
stupidly. 

“Not too bad,” crackled the 
answer from the Translator on 
Phillips’ hip, his companion unable 
to speak English. 

“We should try and get to the 
mountains.” 

“No. Rest. Wait.” The Trans- 



lator’s electronic voice approxi- 
mated that of its subject. 

Phillips straightened his shoul- 
ders. “We’ll die here.” He stood 
and scratched at the peeling skin of 
the ship, listening to the subliminal 
homing signal pulsing outward 
from the crash area. 

“We won’t.” 

“I’ve got to keep you alive.” 
“You've got to live.” 

“That’s not what the book says.” 
“1 know.” 

The man whirled. “There must 
be some chance!” he cried. “As a 
Controller/Explorer Team I should 
think the two of us might be able to 
do something!" 

“Explorer,” said the Translator 
softly, “we must wait. Remain as 
cool as possible.” The man’s com- 
panion saw perspiration on his fore- 
head. “You need water . .” 
Phillips shook his head. “No. 
You need it much more — ” 

“1 won’t argue. Explorer.” 
Phillips stood motionless for a 
moment, then moved into the ship. 
It was quiet with the Controller’s 
presence, his companion, and he 
walked softly to the supplies. He 
swallowed the water deeply, an 
angry expression on his face. 

“Now a Nutrient-A capsule . .” 
“You need those too,” answered 
Phillips. 



126 




“A C/E Team could never hope 
to function efficiently with one 
member starving himself,” return- 
ed the Controller. 

Phillips gulped down the capsule 
and fell onto the command-sofa in 
the compartment. Sighing, he 
stared at the mountains through 
the shredded hole where the nose of 
the ship once was. The Controller 
dropped into silence and the Ex- 
plorer listened intently to the reas- 
surance drifting through his mind. 
Although the psychic bond between 
Controller and Explorer very 
seldom went beyond general ex- 
pressions of emotion, the entire 
program was based on that very 
rare talent that enabled the two be- 
ings to communicate. The Trans- 
lator did as its name implied, but 
the bond made the team, and even 
now Phillips felt fortunate to have 
been selected for a C/E Team. He 
knew he would not be alive now had 
he been a solitary individual “out 
there.” 

H e closed his eyes and saw the 
interior of his patrol craft, 
panels and computer grids popping 
into his mind like soap bubbles, 
and he thought back . 

A light was blinking red and 
white in a central console. 
"Phillips, you’ve got a bleed-off 
light on Number Two Fuel By- 
pass,” said the Controller from a 
tele-screen. The Explorer looked 
up from an old film and reached 
across for the toggle beneath the 



light and said, “Sorry. Didn’t see 
it.” 

He tugged the switch and heard a 
muffied roar, quick, sounding 
more like a thump against the skin 
of the ship than an explosion. 
“Flare-up in the Bypass, Phillips,’ 
said the Controller, consulting a 
sensor monitor. Phillips sat 
straight, ignoring the film. “Bad?” 

The Controller switched a screen 
on the man’s panel and he saw an 
image awash with white vapour 
trailing into space. “You can see 
there,” said the Controller. 

“We’re losing it,” muttered 
Phillips. 

“I’m afraid so. Inertial systems 
will go within the hour. I’m already 
losing telemetry from Base.” 

“Recommendations?” 

The Controller consulted his 
computer scans. “Planet Dante. If 
we reach it in a reasonable amount 
of time Planetfall can be made 
without much problem.” The 
man’s eyebrows rose in question. 
“As of now,” said the Controller, 
“chances are fair. I expect them to 
be poor by the time we reach the 
planet.” 

“You’re confident we can make 
it?” asked Phillips, staring into the 
screen above his console. “I’m feed- 
ing your Library Grid Environ- 
mental Data now.” answered the 
Controller. 

The Explorer read the glowing 
characters aloud: “Surface temper- 
ature over seventy-five percent of 
the planet greater than fifty degrees 



127 




centigrade ...” 

“At nightfall it drops down to a 
comfortable forty-five,” observed 
the Controller wryly. “What few 
mountain ranges there are approxi- 
mate more temperate earth condi- 
tions. Unfortunately, the shorelines 
are wholly inaccessible.” 

The monitor screens began to 
flicker, the ship losing electrical 
control, soon to be dead in space. 
“Marvelous,” sighed Phillips, lean- 
ing back in the command-sofa. 
“Are you okay back there?” 

Dark eyes met his from the 
scanner. “I’m relatively safe for the 
time being ...” 

“I think both of us should get 
into the escape-shuttle and — ” 
“The escape-shuttle was carried 
away by debris,” interrupted the 
Controller. 

Phillips pursed his lips. “Dante 
coming into scanner range now,” 
said the Controller, consulting an 
indicator screen. 

“Nat, are inertial systems going 
to be able to handle this?” asked 
Phillips, casting a harried gaze over 
intermittently blinking panels and 
lights. 

“I’ll need your help . .” an- 
swered the Controller, the image of 
Dante growing on four monitor 
screens. Phillips nodded and shut 
off the still-running film. 

Before the craft screamed into 
Dante’s atmosphere, they launched 
an orbiting distress beacon, radio 
transmissions useless across the 
light years. The leading edges of 



the ship were glowing crimson as 
Phillips watched the blip of the dis- 
tress beacon until the radar popped 
and went dark. The cabin began to 
shudder, overhead light elements 
crackling out, the blue of emer- 
gency lanterns sputtering on. The 
man ran his fingers across rows of 
buttons. The shuddering continued 
to increase. “Nat, I can’t hold 
it . .” 

The Controller’s screen was dark 
but audio facilities hadn’t failed: 
“Worse . than I expected ... If 
it’s still on, punch up System 
476-H, will you?” The voice was a 
gasp. Phillips searched his panels. 
One navigation sector was still 
alive. He punched up 476-H. It 
held. “Thanks,” said the Con- 
troller. Phillips smiled nervously, 
the vibration shaking his teeth. It 
grew hotter in the cabin and he 
strained against the pull of rising 
g's. Metal surfaces were hot be- 
neath his hands and he smelled 
burning plastic. Suddenly the 
emergency lights shorted out and 
he was in darkness. 

“Nat!” 

The shuddering reached an in- 
tense peak and fingers of flame 
waved about the cabin. Phillips 
choked in the acrid smoke. “Nat!” 
he coughed. “Nat!” The howl of re- 
entry filled his ears and his eyes 
burned with hot tears. The flames 
grew. He attempted to pull himself 
onto the deck and was thrown onto 
his back and into unconscious- 
ness . 



128 



GALAXY 




G rains of sand scratched his 
eyes when he awoke. Blinking, 
he rolled carefully onto his 
stomach. Nothing felt broken. He 
studied the surface of Dante, shift- 
ing and blowing sand, the moun- 
tains painfully distant. He stood, 
looking about. Pain lanced through 
his hip and he limped across to the 
broken craft, clouds of sand billow- 
ing before him. Although pieces of 
the vessel were scattered over the 
better part of an acre, the main 
cabin had remained remarkably in- 
tact. He realized he had been 
thrown clear when the main escape 
hatch had blown open on impact. 
He looked through the fuselage, 
smoke still fouling the air. Leaning 
against a scorched bulkhead, he 
listened to the sand hissing over the 
craft’s hull and wondered what had 
become of the Controller. Moving 
from the cabin he looked about in- 
tently. Nat had made planetfall. 
Something would be about, even if 
he was spread over an acre of 
desert. 

“Phillips?” 

The Translator amplification of 
the weakened voice widened the 
man’s face into a grin and he 
looked about the ship. He saw the 
cylinder of the pocket-Translator 
upright in the sand and reached 
down for it, saying, “I’m here, Nat! 
We made it!” 

“It would seem so,” answered 
the Controller, his voice faint even 
through the speaker. Phillips 
walked back into the ship. 



“Where . where are you?” he 
asked. 

“Here,” squeeked Nat, pushing 
aside a blackened panel with his 
head. Even though there was an 
eternal anthropormorphic smile on 
his face, there was irritation in the 
twitters and whistles of the bottle- 
nosed dolphin’s voice, precious sa- 
line solution dribbling from his 
ruptured tank . 

“Phillips!” 

The Explorer shook his head. 
Memories fled from his mind with 
the wind. He turned on the com- 
mand-sofa. 

The Controller lifted his head 
above the level of dirty water in the 
small tank. “You’re daydream- 
ing,” the Translator made the 
reedy whistles of the dolphin under- 
standable. 

“Thinking,” answered Phillips, 
his tongue translated through the 
collar on the dolphin’s neck. 

“About the crash?” 

Phillips didn’t answer, the Con- 
troller sensing his guilt. “There was 
nothing we could’ve done ...” 

“Had I been more alert — ” 
mused Phillips, wiping sweat from 
his bleary eyes. 

“ — And I more capable, we 
would’ve set down perfectly on one 
of those mountain-tops out there,” 
returned the Controller brusquely. 
“Phillips, one can only do so much 
in a situation such as ours.” 

The man was unconvinced. “It 
doesn’t look very good, Nat.” He 
regarded the small cache of salvag-

ed water and food above the tank. 

“We’ll make it.” 

“Your Cetatean intuition tell you 
that?” asked the Explorer. 

“You know we have that 
ability.” 

“I know.” Phillips’ voice was 
bitter with frustration. 

“With the ship as banged-up as 
it was, we’re lucky to be alive.” 

“What do they say about any 
landing you can walk away from?” 
queried Phillips. 

“I’m not walking,” answered 
Nat, a smile in his voice. Phillips 
laughed at the joke, his despair dry- 
ing in the wind and the Controller’s 
electronically channeled voice 
crackling through the Translator. 

The man continued to laugh, re- 
flecting upon the tragi-comic plight 
of one of the most valuable teams in 
space exploration: he, laying about 
in the long-underwear-lining of his 
space-suit, baseball cap tugged 
over his ears, and his companion 
crammed into a too-small survival 
tank at his back. And all of this on 
a desert world; with no sun- 
glasses . 

He reached across to the shatter- 
ed frames on the main ship’s con- 
sole. He picked them up gingerly 
and studied the falling pieces of 
gray, polarized lenses; pieces too 
small even to be patched together. 
Hearing Nat issue a sigh through 
the Translator, he stopped laugh- 
ing and they both fell silent. 

He began to sing after a long 
while, his voice a whisper above the 



breeze, growing louder as he went 
on. Presently Nat joined him in a 
squeeky falsetto and they har- 
monized sourly through the chorus 
of I've Been Workin' on the Rail- 
road. 

Toward the conclusion of the 
song Nat fell silent and the hiss of 
the Translator accompanied Phil- 
lips’ last words. “What is it?” he 
asked. 

“Sandstorm,” answered the Con- 
troller. “Coming this way. Approx- 
imately fifty miles per hour . .” 
Phillips scanned the flattened earth 
and saw the low cloud of wind and 
sand, crawling toward them like a 
living creature. All about the 
wreckage was eerie calm. The Ex- 
plorer looked through the perfo- 
rated ship for cover. 

“There isn’t any,” said Nat. “It 
will pass over us. You’ll be exposed 
for at least two full minutes . .” 
Moving quickly, Phillips moved the 
supplies and precious water into a 
small locker, attempting to bend 
the twisted metal closed, succeed- 
ing only partially. He looked to- 
ward the cloud. It was growing and 
a ground-hugging breeze fluttered 
the legs of his clothing. He checked 
the seals on the Controller’s tank. 
“Never mind about that,” said the 
dolphin. “I’ll be all right. Stay out 
of the wind as best as you can, and 
watch the sand doesn’t cover you 
over.” 

“What about you?” asked 
Phillips, blinking against the 
blowing sand.

“If I’m buried,” answered the 
Controller, “you’ll have to dig me 
out. I’ve my own atmosphere in 
here.” 

“But not indefinitely!” cried 
Phillips. 

“Which is why you can’t let your- 
self be covered over! here it 
comes!” Phillips switched off the 
Translator and tucked it into his 
suit, pulling all the zippers closed. 
He pulled his hat down over his 
eyes and pulled the helmet seal 
from his collar, covering his nose 
and mouth. The material was wet 
with perspiration and cool against 
his face. He crouched beneath the 
leading edge of the main panel, his 
body pressed against the bulkhead. 
He looked toward the tank and saw 
Nat staring at him intently. 

And the storm was there. 

T he heat and tremendous wind 
burned the metal zippers into 
his chest and he gasped with pain, 
his sigh ripped away in the scream- 
ing gale. Sand and rocks pitched 
around him and a heavy stone col- 
lided with his arm. He lifted his 
hand and the wind slapped it down. 
Even huddled under the console he 
felt sand shifting beneath him and 
rising over his body. He leaned out 
toward the tank and fell to the 
earth, sand covering his face. He 
reached out scrabbling hands, 
burning with the sand and heat. He 
felt nothing but the ragged pain of 
his cut and torn fingers,. 

On his stomach the sand march- 



ed over his back, pinning his chest 
onto the hard deck; stones scratch- 
ed his cheeks and sand sifted 
through his entire suit. He attempt- 
ed to move but could only wave his 
arms and legs feebly, his torso 
crushed by the sand. 

Foolishly he peered through dirt- 
caked eyes; a thorny branch of 
some desert plant, ripped up by the 
wind, slapped his eyes and they 
clouded with blood. 

And the storm was gone. 

The wind was a whisper in his 
ears as he slowly shook the sand 
from his hair. Then there was no 
sound at all. In the silence he tried 
to stand but was held down by the 
mound of sand. 

Squirming beneath it he was 
soon on his back. His legs were still 
buried but he easily pulled himself 
clear of the dune that had built it- 
self over him. He sat up, brushing 
the sand from his face. There were 
fistfuls of it in the collar of his suit 
and it drained down his back as he 
leaned forward, standing slowly. 

He felt pounds of earth dropping 
through his suit to his legs where it 
gathered in billows at his zippered 
ankles. He reached down and the 
sand flowed out of the opened 
flaps. He shook his legs until the 
greater portion of it was gone. He 
turned about, eyes searching. 

The wreckage had been almost 
completely buried. Shards of metal 
gleamed in the afternoon light and 
an occasional flap of material 
fluttered silently through the sand. 



OF A DEATH ON DANTE 



131 




but he found himself standing no- 
where near his ship. The cloud was 
almost out of his sight now, sinking 
below the horizon, creating new 
land as it moved. 

He couldn't see the tank. 

He reached into his suit and 
pulled out the Translator. Brushing 
the sand from it, he hit the small 
switch. 

“Phillips . can you . hear 
me?” The Controller’s voice was in 
the Translator almost immediately. 

“Yes. I’m all right,” answered 
the man, looking about. 

“1 . don’t think ... I am.” 
The voice was choked, gasping. 
Phillips studied the area around 
him. Small bits of metal and cloth, 
a new dune. “Nat,” he said, “I’m 
not sure if I’ll be able to find the 
ship. Everything’s buried.” 

“1 . had . considered that 
contingency.” Phillips began to 
probe the sand surrounding the 
many pieces of his craft. He slung 
the Translator on his belt as the 
Controller said, “I made certain 1 
had some small control over the aft 
retro-fire assembly . .” 

As he discarded a small lump of 
aluminum the man said, “You 
might be able to kick up a little 
dust . .” 

“Perhaps.” He paused at an 
overturned and useless generator 
unit, sitting on his haunches 
thoughtfully. There was no wind at 
all now and the white sun burned 
rays of gold across his face. He 
heard a whine beneath him. The 



retro-fire assembly. Standing, he 
cried, “It’s working!” The Trans- 
lator was silent. A puff of sand 
belched upward from the middle of 
the litter and Phillips ran to it, a 
grin on his face. The electric whine 
was dying . 

“That’s it . .” gasped the Con- 
troller. “I’m afraid the unit’s 
shot . .” 

“That’s good enough,” answered 
Phillips. “That’s good enough.” He 
pulled at the sand with both hands 
and was soon smoothing it down 
from the rounded hull. Minutes 
later he felt the tank and increased 
his efforts, perspiration clearing his 
face of sand and blood. His chest 
was pounding and vision blurred. 
Finally the tank was completely un- 
covered and he looked down at the 
Controller. 

The seals had not held. 

Nat was resting on two feet of 
sand, the brown water just covering 
his sides. He rolled about, wetting 
his back. Phillips looked at the dull 
patches on the silver-gray dorsal 
fin. His companion was dehydrat- 
ing. He sighed and leaned against 
the tank, tired eyes closing. 

“Explorer,” the dolphin was say- 
ing, “I’m all right . it’s just that 
I’ve got some sand in my eye . 
and I can’t seem to get this damn 
water clear . .” 

The man twisted off the 
damaged seals and looked at the 
shredded gaskets as he opened the 
tank. “We’ll lose the water a lot 
faster now,” he said, putting his 



132 



GALAXY 




finger gently in the corner of the 
Controller’s eye. 

“No. Back . yes . that’s 
it . Thank you.” Nat smiled up 
at him and he smiled back, for- 
getting that Controllers always 
smile. He dropped the top of the 
tank back down and burrowed to- 
ward the damaged locker where he 
had stowed the provisions. Tugging 
open the bent door he peered inside 
and cursed softly. 

The anger reached the Controller 
before the curse and he watched the 
man silently remove the still wet 
sand that filled the broken water 
flasks. He carried them out of the 
ship and hurled them, one-by-one, 
into four directions. He returned, 
puffing with dimming anger and 
said, “That’s better.” 

‘•‘Although 1 appreciate your 
frustration,” said the Controller, 
“you should attempt to conserve 
your energies.” 

“What for?” asked Phillips help- 
lessly. “We need water. We won’t 
survive another day here and I can’t 
carry you around on my back look- 
ing for it.” 

“That would be impractical,” 
answered the dolphin, motionless 
in the tank, eyes closed in thought 
or sleep. Phillips wasn’t certain. He 
looked away. 

“Well, 1 guess that’s it,” Phillips 
said finally. 

The Controller didn’t answer and 
the man sighed, feeling a growing 
sense of calm resignation ' in his 
mind that was not his own. He 



turned and said, “Nat, what have 
you done?” 

“Done?” 

Phillips stood, saying, “Don’t 
play games with me. You can’t con- 
ceal that. Nat, it’s against regula- 
tions!” 

“Explorer,” said the Controller 
slowly, “it doesn’t matter . .” 
The man looked down into the 
tank, the dolphin’s back wrinkled 
and brown. “It does! 1 cannot allow 
you to die!” 

“You have no choice.” 

Phillips shook his head. “Have 
you always known?” 

“When 1 saw this was the only 
planet 1 knew.” 

“It’s wrong.” 

“Is it?” asked the Controller. 
“To insure the safety of those en- 
trusted to you — to be certain some- 
one survives?” 

The man leaned against the case. 
“Would you have made it in the 
ship after the accident, had we re- 
mained in space?” 

“.Sealed off as 1 was, yes,” 
answered Nat flatly. “But you 
would have been dead long before 
we reached Base.” 

“Without water I’ll die now re- 
gardless,” said Phillips. 

“A ship will be here by morning. 
Although you’ll be grossly dehy- 
drated. you’ll be alive.” 

“And you?” 

The Controller ignored him. 
With sadness growing in his 
heart Phillips said, “You had no 
right.” 



OF A DEATH ON DANTE 



133 




“As a Controller 1 had every 
right. As your friend, 1 had an obli- 
gation.” 

“What about my obligation to 
you?” asked the Explorer. “You 
tell me 1 would’ve died in space. 
Now you’ll die here. How — ” 

“ — Did 1 make my decision?” 
Phillips nodded mutely. He heard 
the Controller sigh. “When 1 was 
growing up, in the oceans back 
home, there were many tales told 
among us. Of humans we knew a 
great deal. And one of the stories 
I’ve always remembered was that of 
our ancestors helping shipwrecked 
sailors to shore, defending them 
from harm, protecting them. And I 
realized when 1 evaluated heuristics 
a i ter the accident that those tales 
weren’t legends or sleep-time 
stories. They were truth, and I 
understood.” 

“Regulations state,” began Phil- 
lips through clenched teeth, “that 
in the event of a life-or-death situa- 
tion during a C/E Team mission, 
the life and protection of the Con- 
troller shall be maintained over and 
above the life of the Explorer. Very 
explicit.” 

“That regulation was established 
by your superiors — humans. They 
realize our importance in space ex- 
ploration but do not understand 
our personal dignity. They never 
have.” 

“Dignity?” 

“Phillips,” said the Controller, 
“it is simply beyond my imagina- 
tion to allow you to die.” 



“And it’s beyond mine that you 
can do this.” 

The dolphin was silent for several 
moments and he then asked, “Had 
you the choice, would you have in- 
sured my survival above yours?” 

“Of course.” 

“Why then, do you deny me the 
same right?” 

Phillips moved away from the 
tank and reclined on the command- 
sofa. The fatigue and his com- 
panion’s words pressed on his 
shoulders with a tremendous 
weight. He looked across the desert 
and saw the sun riding on the 
mountains, long shadows crossing 
the dunes. Darkness was approach- 
ing slowly and he watched it march- 
ing toward him, quietly saying, 
“You should’ve told me.” 

“You would not have allowed 
it.” 

Phillips glared at the tank. 
“You’re damn right!” 

The Controller chuckled ragged- 
ly and said, “I remember some- 
thing I was told long ago . .” 

“What’s that?” 

“When 1 was finally selected for 
the C/E program, my family told 
me that although humans recogniz- 
ed us as intelligent beings they 
would always treat us as pets and 
we should tolerate that as best we 
could.” 

Phillips smiled slightly and said, 
“I hope I haven’t been too much of 
a burden . .” 

“Not at all, 1- — ” Nat began to 
cough violently and the man moved 



134 



GALAXY 




from the command-sofa to the side 
of the tank. He pushed away the 
top and put his hand onto the Con- 
troller’s great head, feeling the rac- 
ing pulse beneath the dulling flesh. 
He moved his hand in gentle 
strokes, his throat tightening with 
each gasp from his companion. 
Soon the dolphin found his voice 
again and said, “You’ve been 
everything to me, Phillips.” 

“You’ve always been my friend, 
Nat,” answered the man, finding 
his words clouded by black 
thoughts of death. 

“Oh, don’t entertain notions,” 
said the Controller, a dismissing 
tone in his voice. “One of us alive is 
far better than both of us dead.” 
Phillips brow rose. “We’re a 
team. What am 1 supposed to do?” 
“There’s dozens of Controllers 
waiting for a chance to work with 
an experienced Explorer like your- 
self.” 

“I’m j;oMr Explorer,” responded 
the man, moving his hand onto the 
dolphin’s back, feeling shuddering 
breaths shallow beneath his hand. 

“Yes,” sighed Nat. “And I’m 
your Controller.” 

“We’re a team.” 

“A team,” repeated the Con- 
troller. “I’m sorry, Phillips.” The 
streamlined form was trembling be- 
neath the Explorer’s hand and soon 
it was still and he felt a sickening 
wave of black sweep deeper into his 
mind. 

“Nat,” he said softly, bending 
dow n and staring in the twilight at 



the Controller. The laughing dol- 
phin-face stared back at him. 



T he night was starless above him 
as he scraped a hollow in the 
sand with a flattened hull plate, ig- 
noring the heat and the convulsions 
of his own thirsting body. Once he 
managed to swallow a Nutrient-A 
capsule w'ith difficulty, working on 
without rest. As he was smoothing 
the last handful of sand over his 
companion he heard a distant whis- 
per in the growing light of dawn 
and looked toward the horizon. 

Suddenly it was over him. A 
wide-bellied rescue ship, screaming 
turbine engines churning the sand, 
its red beacon flashing in the pale 
light. It pulled back slowly, massive 
with metal and sound above his 
head. He saw figures moving inside 
the bubble canopies, a Controller 
peering through its saline solution, 
a human commander on the flight 
deck. Phillips stared up through 
the clouds of sand and asked, 
“What am 1 supposed to do?” He 
didn’t even hear himself in the 
roar.

THE AERIAL MACHINE 




C LARKSON was irritable, partly 
because of the pain in his foot. 
As a result he ceased to think cor- 
rectly, and his experiment kept 
going wrong. He added the catalyst 
four times altogether (checking and 
rechecking his sequence each time) 
but still the reactions failed to 



materialize. Eventually he aban- 
doned the experiment — and the 
laboratory — altogether, half blam- 
ing his equipment as even educated 
men sometimes do, and half deter- 
mining to try again when he felt 
fresher, titter. It was bound to be a 
mistake in procedure. 



136 



He walked up the back stairs, 
nursing his irritability. Distantly, 
someone was singing softly: Dora 
probably, who had a habit of sing- 
ing when she imagined her betters 
weren’t about. He might, perhaps, 
speak to her about it. None of the 
other servants seemed to be in evi- 
dence; and in his irritability he 
imagined that they would not be 
about if he happened to require 
them. 

Servants were growing more im- 
possible with every passing year; 
even the women were remarking on 
it. 

He moved up the stairs quite 
slowly, with an uneven gait; since 
he could not place his full weight on 
his foot. Emily would have said the 
motion (and his frown) made him 
look considerably older than he 
was. 

He failed to find her in the 
Sewing Room, somewhat to his 
chagrin. Although his self-aware- 
ness was as limited as that of most 
men of his era he nursed the fleet- 
ing realization that she was the only 
human being in Creation likely to 
lift him from his mood. But if she 
was not to be found, she was not to 
be found. Sighing faintly, he 
limped to the Withdrawing Room 
and, finding a reasonable fire 
there, sat down before it in the only 
decent armchair the house pro- 
vided. 

After a time, he rang for 
Danvers. He appeared eventually. 

“Sir?” 



“Oh, there you are — what kept 
you?” Without waiting for an 
answer, he asked, “Is Mrs. Clark- 
son in the house?” 

“I believe so. Sir,” Danvers said. 
He was youngish for a butler, but 
quite damnably efficient. “Shall I 
look for her. Sir?” 

Clarkson waved his hand nega- 
tively. “Let her be; she’ll find her 
way here eventually. You might see 
if you can find me some port.” 
“Certainly, Sir.” 

He regretted the order the mo- 
ment Danvers left. After all, the 
port was largely responsible for the 
pain in his foot, according to Dr. 
Flanagan. At the same time, life 
would hardly be worth living with- 
out some relief from the sober call 
of duty. Besides, whatever the long- 
term detriment, if you drank 
enough port it deadened the worst 
of the pains for an hour or two. 

Danvers brought in a full de- 
canter with the glass. As he set it on 
the table, he said gravely, “A 
gentleman called a little earlier, 
while you were in the laboratory. I 
informed him you had left instruc- 
tions not to be disturbed.” 

“Good,” Clarkson grunted. He 
stared into the fire, waiting for 
Danvers to pour the port. 

“He intimated that he might 
return later. Sir, when you had con- 
cluded your work.” 

Clarkson sighed heavily. “What 
an infernal nuisance. Who was 
he?” 

“He left his card.” Danvers pro- 



137 




duced it like a prestidigitator and 
laid it beside the glass. 

It was small, expensively en- 
graved, although without the 
ornate elaborations which seemed 
to be affected by many so-called 
gentlemen nowadays. The name 
read, ‘Count Vincent de Berg’. 

“Did he say what he wanted?” 
Clarkson asked, his tone consider- 
ably softened by the title. Al- 
though, as he realized quickly, the 
man might be a Papal Count. The 
name sounded foreign, possibly 
French. 

“Only that he wished to see you 
on a matter of importance. Sir.” 
Danvers hesitated marginally. “I 
hope I did right in not disturbing 
you.” 

“Perfectly right, Danvers. Per- 
fectly right.” Clarkson reached for 
his port. If it was really a matter of 
importance, the man would be 
back. He sipped his port and felt 
the rich, sweet wine ease some of 
his earlier frustrations. “Foreign, 
was he?” 

Danvers nodded. “So I would 
judge. Sir.” 

“French?” 

“Possibly farther afield than 
that.” 

Clarkson let it go. There was al- 
ways the possibility the man might 
be one of those itinerant noblemen 
from Eastern Europe; it was quite 
impossible to tell anything from a 
name nowadays — or even a title, 
come to that. In any case, it was 
useless speculating. The mystery 



would be cleared up when he called 
again. If he called again . 

Emily came in as Danvers with- 
drew. She looked, as usual pale and 
happy. “There you are, darling. 
Finished in your smelly old labora- 
tory?” She came across and kissed 
him, not altogether respectfully, on 
the forehead. Then she caught 
sight of the decanter and frowned. 
“1 thought you were feeling gouty, 
my dear. You know what the doctor 
said about drinking port.” 

“Confound the doctor!” Clark- 
son muttered. He reached defiantly 
for his glass. 

“Really, Charles, I do wish you 
wouldn’t use such expressions.” 
But there was a twinkle in her eyes. 

“And 1 wish you would not use 
such expressions as ‘smelly old 
laboratory’, my dear.” He looked 
up at her and smiled. 

Emily sat down opposite him, 
primly upright — a posture she fre- 
quently adopted when she was 
about to say something outrageous, 
or simply to engage in banter. “But 
it is smelly.” she pointed out. “And 
the wing in which you have housed 
it is certainly old, even if the equip- 
ment you use is not.” Her eyebrows 
elevated. “So what else should 1 
call it?” 

“1 have no idea, my dear,” said 
Clarkson fondly. “But I do feel 
whatever you decide upon should 
be a little more respectful.” 

“You’re very stu%,” Emily said. 
But the subject obviously bored 
her, for she went on almost im- 



138 



GALAXY 




mediately, “Who was the curious 
man who called earlier?” 

Clarkson raised an eyebrow. “I 
was not aware that we had been in- 
vaded by — ” He coughed. 

“ — curious men.” 

“Not men, darling — man. Hardly 
an invasion, but — ” She lowered 
her eyes becomingly. “ — a striking 
individual. I could scarcely contain 
myself for wondering what business 
he might have here.” 

“I fear you will have to contain 
yourself a little longer,” Clarkson 
said. “For 1 presume the individual 
you saw was Count Vincent de Berg 
and I have not the slightest idea 
what business he had here. I have 
only just now learned about his call 
from Danvers.” 

Emily looked a little surprised. 
“You did not see him?” 

Clarkson smiled. “I was working 
in my smelly old laboratory,” he 
said. 

Cook had one of her tantrums, so 
dinner was a little late that evening, 
Clarkson found the delay embar- 
rassing since he was entertaining 
Sir Laurence and Lady Pitney and 
they had, with Presbyterian punc- 
tiliousness, arrived exactly on time. 
But the meal, when it did arrive, 
was up to an acceptable (one 
might, in all modesty, have even 
said exceptional) standard and by 
the time the ladies withdrew, Clark- 
son had mellowed again. 

His humour was further height- 
ened by Sir Laurence, who took the 
opportunity while Danvers served 



the port and laid out a selection of 
Clarkson’s best cigars, to bring the 
conversation around to science. 

“Didn’t want to bring it up be- 
fore, old boy,” he rumbled. “Know 
how these things bore the ladies. 
But frankly. I’ve been keen to have 
your opinion on something. As a 
man of science, you appreciate.” 
He had a basso profundo voice that 
sat well in his portly frame, al- 
though there was a hint of rough- 
ness in it which might have come 
from the prodigious quantities of 
spirits he habitually imbibed. 

Clarkson finished lighting his 
cigar, then waved depreciatingly. 
“Hardly a man of science. Sir 
Laurence. A mere dabbler, if you 
must . .” 

“A dabbler with a reputation,” 
Pitney said. “Don’t think I’m un- 
aware of it. Matter of fact, 1 over- 
heard old Bannerman chatting 
about you in the House the other 
day. Said you were doing some of 
the most interesting investigations 
in chemistry this country has ever 
seen.” 

Although the report was probably 
exaggerated, Clarkson felt both 
surprised and pleased. Lord 
Bannerman was nobody’s fool, de- 
spite his age. But he felt obliged to 
shrug. “Lord Bannerrrian is kind. 
Sir Laurence, but I fear I am no 
more than an amateur in these 
matters. I consider myself fortu- 
nate to have sufficient private in- 
come to allow me to amuse myself 
at these things.” 



THE AERIAL MACHINE 



139 




“The Empire was founded on 
amateur virtues,” Pitney told him. 
“Amateurism is what makes Eng- 
land great — don’t lose sight of that, 
my boy.” He leaned forward in his 
chair. “What 1 want to know — in 
confidence, of course — is your 
opinion of this fellow Darwin.” 

Clarkson hesitated. It was not, 
admittedly, an unexpected ques- 
tion. Evolution had become a fash- 
ionable controversy lately. He had 
his own ideas about the Theory, but 
it was not, perhaps, politic to voice 
them in all and every circum- 
stances. Pitney, in his own gruff 
way, was reputed to be a religious 
man. At the same time, like 
Bannerman, he was not a fool, so it 
would never do to waffle. 

“1 have considerable respect for 
Mr. Darwin’s research,” Clarkson 
said carefully. “And in particular 
his observations in the field.” Pit- 
ney nodded, so it seemed he was on 
a reasonable safe tack. He sipped 
his port. “One must, 1 think, ad- 
mire his courage; first, in exposing 
himself to the rigors of his famous 
voyage; and secondly, for pro- 
pounding his Theory in public 
when he returned.” 

“Agreed,” said Pitney, “but the 
Theory itself — what do you think of 
that. Sir?” 

Something in his tone gave 
Clarkson the clue he had been seek- 
ing. He smiled. “Even a coura- 
geous man may be lacking in wis- 
dom.” 

“Ah,” said Pitney. “Ah.” He 



leaned back and sucked on his 
cigar with an expression of satisfac- 
tion. “So you think he’s a fool, do 
you?” 

It would have been easy to agree, 
but Clarkson, who had in fact some 
sympathy for the Evolutionists, had 
also an ingrained habit of defend- 
ing his self-esteem. “Certainly, not 
a fool. Sir Laurence. Let us merely 
say that — as a man of science if you 
will — 1 find his theory very much 
unproven.” 

“Thought so,” Pitney nodded. 
“You’re being very careful and 1 
appreciate it. But it’s easy to see 
what you really feel.” He chuckled 
suddenly. “Dammit, 1 can trace my 
ancestors back to Bosworth Field 
and there’s not a monkey in the lot 
of them? Although, by George, a 
few of them behaved worse than 
monkeys, what?” 

Clarkson smiled back, but cut 
short his reply as Danvers entered. 
The butler came in behind his chair 
and murmured, “The gentleman 
who called earlier — Count de 

Berg — has returned. Sir.” 

For the second time that evening, 
Clarkson hesitated. The man kept 
calling at the most infernally un- 
suitable times. All the same, he was 
curious to find out what he wanted. 
Courtesy dictated that he should 
not interrupt his conversation with 
Sir Laurence. But if he sent the 
mysterious Count away again, the 
man might conclude he would 
never be welcome. He temporised. 
“Beg to inform the Count that 1 am 



140

engaged at the moment, but if he 
cares to wait I may be free to ar- 
range a suitable appointment a 
little later. If he agrees, show him 
into the library.” 

“Look here, old boy,” Pitney 
said as Danvers withdrew, “if some 
business has come up, don’t let me 
keep you from it. Damn fine meal 
and damn fine conversation, but 
Isobel and I are early to bed at the 
best of times.” 

“Please don’t distress yourself. 
Sir Laurence,” Clarkson told him 
smoothly. “1 wouldn’t dream of 
having you cut short your 
visit — I’m enjoying our talk too 
much. The fact is I have a Con- 
tinental nobleman who keeps 
calling to see me on some mys- 
terious errand. 1 have not had the 
opportunity to speak with him as 
yet, so 1 have no notion of the im- 
portance of his mission. I merely 
suggested to Danvers that he might 
wait a while in the library and per- 
haps if you would excuse me for no 
more than five minutes, I could ar- 
range a mutually convenient time 
for us to discuss whatever he wished 
to discuss.” 

Pitney nodded. “Why not do it 
now. old boy. I’ll join the ladies and 
give them your excuses. Expect I 
can put up with their chatter until 
you get back.” 

“If you really wouldn’t 
mind . .” Clarkson murmured. 

“Course not, old boy. Can’t have 
you sitting all night wondering 
what the fella’s after.” He stood 



up, his bulky frame dominating the 
dining room. “Damn glad to learn 
you’re not one of these bright young 
men chasing after Darwin just be- 
cause that brand of science has be- 
come fashionable.” He lowered his 
voice confidentially. “Don’t take 
offense at this, old boy, but I’m an 
admirer of your work — damn, 
science is the coming thing and any 
man who doesn’t see that is a fool. 
Fact is — and, as 1 say, I wouldn’t 
want you to take offense — if you 
ever feel that you need a little extra 
money for some project in hand — ” 
He caught sight of Clarkson’s ex- 
pression and waved him to silence 
with a meaty hand. “1 appreciate 
you’re a man of substance, Clark- 
son; but even a man of substance 
can sometimes feel the need of 
friends. So if there’s ever a neces- 
sity in the way of equipment or any- 
thing of that sort, I just want you to 
know that I’m sympathetic. Say no 
more.” He stopped, his expression 
vaguely embarrassed. 

“That’s damned white of you. Sir 
Laurence,” Clarkson said easily. 
“Let me assure you no offense has 
been taken. 1 see no prospect of re- 
quiring any but the most modest 
financing in the foreseeable 
future — and as you say, this is cer- 
tainly within my means — but 
should the situation ever arise . .” 
He left the sentence hanging in the 
air, and Pitney appeared more than 
satisfied. 

Clarkson walked down to the 
library experiencing an unfamiliar 



THE AERIAL MACHINE 



141 




mixture of emotions. He was think- 
ing not of his mysterious visitor, 
but of Pitney’s offer. It was inter- 
esting not in itself, but for what it 
implied. Perhaps the Clarkson 
name was becoming known in. the 
right circles after all. How ironic, 
though, that this modest fame 
should stem from something which 
had started as a hobby and little 
else. Despite the irony, he felt a 
warming glow of pride. Was it 
really such a bad thing to become 
known — however modestly — for the 
part one played in the March of 
Science. There was, he had to ad- 
mit, a certain nobility . 

His visitor arose as he opened the 
library door. 

II 

SEEM very pensive, my 
\ dear,” Emily said softly. 
They were sitting alone in the living 
room, the huge log fire which 
Danvers had stoked earlier now 
low, but still glowing cheerfully. 
Emily had been engaged in crochet, 
or embroidery, or some such femi- 
nine frivolity. Clarkson had been 
engaged in thought. 

He looked up. “That, perhaps, is 
because I am pensive,” he said, not 
unkindly. In fact, although he 
would have died rather than admit 
it to her, he felt faintly shaken. 

Emily glanced at him shrewdly. 
“You seemed in excellent humor 
until you talked with the mysterious 
Count de Berg . .” 



“Did I?” Clarkson replied 
calmly enough; but her insight had 
surprised him. It had been like that 
throughout their marriage. He 
would decide, on the basis of con- 
siderable evidence, that she had not 
a serious thought in her pretty little 
head, then some flash of insight — 
indeed sometimes wisdom — would 
bring his carefully-constructed con- 
clusions crashing down. 

Her expression was studiously 
bland. “It also seems to me that 
you spent rather more time with 
our unexpected visitor than might 
have been courteous to our invited 
guests . .” 

He glanced at her sharply. “Do 
you imply criticism of my actions?” 

Emily smiled coolly. “It is 
scarcely the place of a wife to 
criticise herhusband. And yet . .” 
She toyed with a thread from her 
embroidery, winding it coquettishly 
about her finger. 

“And yet?” Clarkson echoed. 

She looked directly into his eyes 
and suddenly all her teasing air had 
vanished. “Charles, darling, you 
must not pretend to me. 1 am, after 
all, your wife and as such I have 
certain rights. No, please — ” He 
had been about to interject, but 
stopped. She set her embroidery 
down, an unconscious gesture 
which emphasized her seriousness. 
“When you rejoined the Pitneys 
and myself after your talk with our 
visitor, you were disturbed. No, Sir, 
do not trouble to deny it: I have 
known you too long and too inti- 



142 



GALAXY 




mately to mistake your mood. Our 
guests were deceived, but I was 
not.” 

The direct approach calmed 
him. It was as if Emily’s sudden 
change of role made him feel less 
alone. “How was 1 then, behind the 
deception?” 

Emily smiled. “You were ex- 
cited, dearest husband. You were 
disturbed; perhaps a little frighten- 
ed. But most of all, you were ex- 
cited. 1 have never seen you engage 
in a sterner battle to prevent your 
emotions becoming evident.” 

For a long moment, Clarkson 
said nothing. Then, on a rare im- 
pulse, he rose, walked across and 
embraced her. “My dear, dear 
Emily! How fortunate I am to have 
married such a jewel! You are cor- 
rect, of course, and 1 was foolish to 
try to hide it from you. 1 was ex- 
cited — more excited, perhaps, than 
1 can ever remember being since a 
child. The Count de Berg is a most 
remarkable man.” He began to 
pace the room, his expression 
thoughtful. “A most remark- 
able . .” 

“Then,” Emily said mock stern- 
ly, “you must tell me all about 
him.” The coquette appeared be- 
hind her eyes again. “And about 
the business he came to discuss.” 

“Very well,” Clarkson said firm- 
ly. He looked at her seriously. “1 do 
not need to tell you everything 1 say 
must be treated in confidence — 
absolute confidence.” 

“Cross my heart,” said Emily; 



and though the gesture was 
childish, he knew she meant it. 

“First, the Count. As you saw, he 
is a most impressive-seeming 
man.” 

“1 saw him only at a distance,” 
Emily interjected. “Since you have 
decided to trust me with your sec- 
ret, you must tell me all. How he 
looked, how he dressed, from what 
remote spot he originated. And — ” 

Clarkson held up a hand. 
“Enough, dear wife, you shall 
know all. He is a man shorter in 
stature than 1 am, but with enor- 
mous presence. 1 could not guess 
his age, for he is one of those indi- 
viduals with truly timeless features. 
He dressed soberly, with taste, in 
black. And as for his origin, al- 
though 1 did not venture to ques- 
tion him on that point, I feel it may 
be remote indeed.” 

“France?” asked Emily. “Or be- 
yond?” 

“1 would say Russia,” Clarkson 
told her. “His English is impec- 
cable and 1 was quite unable to de- 
tect a hint of accent; but it was that 
careful English one hears when the 
speaker does not hold it as his 
mother tongue. No, he is not a 
native of these islands. It was the 
cast of his features which gave me 
the clue: were it not for his bearing 
and obvious breeding, 1 would have 
thought him an Asiatic — possibly 
even a half-caste Chinee. But since, 
as 1 say, he is obviously nothing of 
the sort, we must, 1 think, assume 
he is a Russian, for part of that 



THE AERIAL MACHINE 



143 




country borders Asia and so many 
of its inhabitants — even in the 
highest circles — display certain 
Asiatic characteristics.” 

“So he is Russian,” Emily said, 
accepting the logic without further 
question. 

Clarkson ceased to pace and sat 
down again, but the excitement was 
still obvious in his face. “I believe 
so. It is unimportant. What is im- 
portant — ” He hesitated, as if even 
at this stage he doubted the wisdom 
of telling her everything. But the 
conflict was resolved almost in- 
stantly. “What is important is that 
our mysterious visitor is an in- 
ventor — the designer of an aerial 
machine!” 

There was silence in the room, 
broken only by the measured tick- 
ing of the grandfather clock. A log 
shifted in the fireplace, hissed and 
sparked. 

Emily frowned. “A balloon? 
Count de Berg is a balloonist?” 

“No!” exclaimed Clarkson ex- 
citedly. “Not a balloonist! That is 
exactly the point! When he first 
told me his business, I made the 
mistake you have made. His inven- 
tion is as far beyond the balloon as 
the balloon is beyond a toy kite. He 
has designed an aerial machine — 
an airship!” 

Emily stared at him in silence. 
By her expression, she was having 
difficulty assimilating the informa- 
tion. Eventually she said hesitantly, 
“A ship that flies through the air?” 

Clarkson nodded vigorously. 



“But . but, dear Charles, 
such a thing is impossible.” 

Clarkson smiled, a little smugly. 
“1 am afraid, my dear, that in your 
imagination you are picturing an 
ocean liner sailing through the 
heavens. That indeed is impossible. 
A flying machine heavier than air is 
a logical absurdity. We know from 
our experience with balloons that 
any flying device must, in some 
manner, be buoyed up.” He stood 
suddenly and reached for the bell 
pull. “1 shall do better than tell 
you: 1 shall show you.” 

They waited impatiently until 
Danvers appeared. Clarkson sent 
him off for drawing materials and 
presently he returned with several 
sheets of paper, an inkwell and a 
quill. Clarkson would have preferr- 
ed charcoal, but he let it go for the 
sake of expediency. Now that he 
had begun to tell Emily about the 
airship, his imagination had taken 
fire and burned away all hope of 
patience. 

He laid a sheet of paper on the 
table and began to sketch. “Now 
here we have a typical balloon. 
Here the balloon itself and here the 
gondola. The balloon is, of course, 
spherical — or approximately spher- 
ical. Hardly a modern invention 
and hardly a particularly useful 
one; except, of course, for 
sportsmen and adventurers. But for 
all that, the first device with which 
Man has attempted to conquer the 
air. You know the scientific prin- 
ciple of the balloon, of course?” 



144 



GALAXY 




Emily nodded, but in his excite- 
ment he appeared not to notice. 
“Although the basket, and indeed 
the canopy of the balloon are in 
themselves heavier than the air, 
once the balloon is inflated, we 
introduce buoyancy. The sum-total 
buoyancy of the inflated balloon is 
greater than the weight of the bal- 
loon material and the gondola. 
Thus the balloon rises, buoyed up 
by the air around it. 

Hot air, as we all know, is lighter 
than cold air and thus rises. The 
first balloons were filled with hot 
air. A fire was built in the gondola 
for that purpose.” 

“Was not that dangerous?” 
Emily asked. 

Clarkson nodded at her and 
smiled. “Extremely dangerous, my 
dear. Good men have lost their lives 
because the fire got out of control. 
However, in more modern times, 
the primitive hot-air concept has 
been replaced by balloons filled 
with some lighter-than-air gas, 
such as hydrogen. The effect is 
identical, but since there is no 
naked flame, the device is consider- 
ably safer.” 

In a moment of whimsy, he drew 
a matchstick man in the gondola 
and added hanging weights to the 
side. “Although they have little 
commercial importance, modern 
balloons are quite sophisticated. 
We can control their ascent by 
lightening the gondola: all that is 
necessary is to throw out some 
weights — usually bags of sand. And 



we can descend again by the use of 
a valve which spills sufficient of the 
gas to allow a landing.” 

He set the quill down and sat 
back in his chair. “But for all its 
sophistication, the balloon has very 
considerable drawbacks as a mode 
of transport. In it, we can travel no 
faster than the prevailing winds 
permit. More important, although 
we can ascend and descend, we 
cannot steer. In short, as a practi- 
cal form of transport, the balloon is 
useless.” 

“But,” Emily put in gently, “you 
tell me Count de Berg is not a 
balloonist.” 

Clarkson’s excitement flared 
again. “No indeed.” He returned to 
his table and his quill. “1 have not 
had time to study the plans of this 
man's remarkable invention in any 
detail, you appreciate, so there may 
be particular flaws which have es- 
caped me. But the general prin- 
ciple . .” He sketched a fat cigar 
beside his earlier drawing and 
added a curiously-shaped gondola 
underneath. “He envisages a bal- 
loon of rigid structure. The frame- 
work might be of light, strong 
wood, or possibly some alloy com- 
bining strength and lightness. The 
structure allows us to vary the 
shape from the spherical. I do not 
expect you to follow this, my dear, 
but for a guided airship shape is 
important, since we must in some 
manner eliminate wind resistance. 
Our airship must, so to speak, cut 
through the currents of the upper 



THE AERIAL MACHINE 



145 




atmosphere as our more familiar 
ships cut through the currents of 
the oceans. For various reasons, the 
Count feels this cigar shape is the 
most suitable.” 

The quill made amendments to 
the gondola, added an exaggerated 
propeller to one end. “There is al- 
most no limit to the size we can 
construct such a balloon. With 
greater size, we have greater lift. 
Thus the gondola may be massive 
and may house — ” He looked 
across at Emily and smiled“ — ma- 
chinery. This is the essence of the 
Count’s invention. He proposes to 
fit machinery in the gondola. This 
machinery will propel a shaft and 
the shaft will, in turn, propel an 
air-screw. This screw will drive our 
great airship through the atmos- 
phere exactly as the screw of a ship 
drives it across the sea.” 

Emily frowned. “But what will 
he use to drive his machinery?” she 
asked. 

Clarkson looked at her in sur- 
prise. “Why, my dear, there is only 
one source of energy powerful 
enough to motivate a device of this 
magnitude. 1 should have thought 
you might have guessed, even with- 
out my scientific training. The air- 
ship will be powered by steam.” 

Ill 

T he little doctor bustled in be- 
fore Danvers had time to an- 
nounce his arrival. Clarkson 
guiltily set his glass of port behind a 



vase, but not, apparently, quickly 
enough. 

“At it again, Charles? Some men 
never learn.” He shook his head 
and set his black bag down beside a 
chair. “Well, since you’re intent on 
killing yourself, I suppose the least 
1 can do is keep you company.” 
Clarkson smiled and gestured to 
Danvers. “Another glass for Dr. 
Flanagan. And I suppose you’d 
better bring a fresh bottle — this one 
is almost empty.” 

“Well,” said Dr. Flanagan as 
Danvers left, “I suppose I should 
ask you how you are. Although in 
my professional opinion, you are 
looking healthier than a horse. 
How is the foot?” 

Clarkson shrugged. Curiously 
enough, his foot had been giving 
him a lot less trouble lately than in 
the past. “A few twinges now and 
then. Nothing to speak of. Frankly, 
1 doubt your diagnosis.” 

“Frankly, so have I. Always 
thought you were a bit young for 
gout, although since you insist on 
living like a reprobate, anything is 
possible. How’s the work?” 

For a moment, Clarkson stared 
at him blankly. Then he said, “Oh, 
my experiments? To be perfectly 
honest, 1 have not been in the labo- 
ratory for almost two weeks.” 

Dr. Flanagan sat down. The 
leather armchair dwarfed him but 
his expression suggested he was 
perfectly at home. “Delighted to 
hear it, dear boy. Overwork never 
did anybody any good; and believe 



146 



GALAXY 




me, you’ve been overworking for 
years. Never could understand it in 
a man who does not have to earn a 
living. Now if 1 was a rich young 
man like yourself, instead of an old 
pauper — ” 

“You would do exactly as 1 do,” 
Clarkson put in. “Unless I am 
grossly mistaken about your char- 
acter, you are as devoted to the ad- 
vancement of science as I am.” 

If Flanagan intended to reply, he 
was cut short by Danvers’ appear- 
ance with the port. When the butler 
left, they raised their glasses. 

“To your very good health. Doc- 
tor,” Clarkson said. 

“And to yours, Mr. Clarkson,” 
said the doctor. “Even though such 
•an eventuality must cut down the 
outrageous fees 1 am pleased to 
charge you.” 

They drank. As Flanagan set 
down his glass, he said, “I fear 1 
can’t enjoy your company for long, 
Charles. 1 have had a spate of calls 
this morning — 1 only dropped in 
for a moment since I was passing.” 

“1 trust we are not witnessing the 
beginnings of a local epidemic?” 
Clarkson remarked. It was lightly 
put, but there was a hint of serious- 
ness behind it just the same. Epi- 
demics did occur. Come winter es- 
pecially, they waited on the wings 
of human experience like spectres 
of death. Occasionally they moved 
center stage and the combined ad- 
vances of modern medicine were 
powerless against them. 

“Not unless imagination and stu- 



pidity are infectious,” shrugged the 
little doctor, “which my professors 
always assured me could not be the 
case.” 

Clarkson smiled. “That strikes 
me as an interesting remark. 
Doctor. Would you care to explain 
it?” 

Flanagan sighed. He looked 
longingly at his glass of port as if 
regretting the fate which prevented 
the devotion of his life to such 
pleasures. “My dear sir, every 
doctor numbers amongst his 
patients those — most often ladies of 
advancing years and astronomical 
income — who require no more po- 
tent medicaments than attention. 1 
fear my practice is no exception; 
although naturally wild horses 
would not drag their names from 
me.” 

There was no need for equine 
pressures, for the names of Dr. 
Flanagan’s more difficult patients 
were known to every tradesman in 
the district — and for essentially the 
same reasons. “And one of these 
good ladies demands your attention 
this morning?” Clarkson asked. 

“Not one. Sir — several. They 
have decided, individually and col- 
lectively, that they are suffering 
from shock.” He sipped his port 
and favored Clarkson with a know- 
ing look. “Because of a strange ex- 
perience they underwent together 
last evening.” 

“Fascinating,” Clarkson said. 
“Tell me more — or will that inter- 
fere with your Hippocratic Oath?” 



THE AERIAL MACHINE 



147 




“Damn the bit!” Flanagan ex- 
claimed. “It seems several of this 
town's good ladies meet occasional- 
ly for an evening of social inter- 
course. Chatter about how badly 
their sons treat them and gossip 
about the evil doings of the younger 
generation. There was one such 
gathering yesterday evening. After- 
wards, as they were repairing to 
their separate homes, a number of 
these ladies saw — or thought they 
saw— a ship. We are inland, you 
appreciate, Charles, so this vision is 
strange enough as it stands. But 
not satisfied with such strangeness, 
our fine ladies claim this ship was 
flying through the air!” He frown- 
ed. “Oddly enough, I have heard 
one or two reports of a mysterious 
flying object from rather more re- 
liable sources.” The frown cleared. 
“While the vision apparently did 
them little damage last night, they 
have decided this morning that they 
are shocked, and consequently — 
why, Clarkson, what’s the matter?” 
Clarkson set his glass down, 
aware that he must have gone quite 
pale. His mind was racing. It was 
apparent that matters were moving 
forward far faster than he had an- 
ticipated. The problem now was 
what to tell the doctor. Clarkson’s 
shocked reaction to the news was 
too apparent to pass without some 
comment. Nor did he feel the little 
doctor could easily be fobbed off 
with some makeshift story: he had 
far too high an opinion of Flana- 
gan’s native shrewdness for that. 



He came to a conclusion. “Tom, 
a moment ago, in jest, I mentioned 
the Hippocratic Oath. I should like 
to mention it again, seriously this 
time. 1 have something to tell you, 
but it must remain forever a privi- 
leged communication. Although it 
does not concern my health, I 
would ask you to hold it as confi- 
dential as any detail of my most 
serious illness. Do I have your 
word?” 

“By Jove, you intrigue me!” 
Flanagan exlaimed. “For what it’s 
worth, of course you have my 
word.” 

“Very well,” said Clarkson; and 
launched into the story of his initial 
meeting with the Count de Berg. 

“Since then,” he went on, “I 
have seen the Count on two further 
occasions. The first of these was a 
brief meeting. But during the 
second, which took place only a few 
days ago, he did me the honor of 
showing me detailed specifications 
of his airship. The thing is an engi- 
neering miracle, Tom. He even 
plans to have the passenger quar- 
ters lighted by electricity to pro- 
mote the most exquisite comfort 
during flights at night.” A cloud 
passed over his face. “As he was 
leaving, he did mention the possi- 
bility that he might soon be testing 
a prototype. But 1 had no idea the 
test would come so soon.” 

For a long moment, the doctor 
regarded him shrewdly. “This 
Count: why did he bring his plans 
to you?” 



148 



GALAXY 




Clarkson glanced down modest- 
ly. “I believe my experiments in 
chemistry have left me with some 
little reputation as a man of 
science. The Count may perhaps 
have felt he would have a sympa- 
thetic and intelligent hearing.” 

Flanagan nodded. Clarkson went 
on, “There was, perhaps, a rather 
more delicate aspect of his ap- 
proach. He intimated that he would 
need funds. Planning an airship is 
one thing. Actually building one is 
another. Such a project would 
strain even the resources of a 
wealthy man. So he offered me a 
partnership in his enterprise in 
return for an investment.” 

"An equal partnership?” the 
doctor asked bluntly. 

The bluntness was embarrassing, 
but Clarkson was accustomed to 
bluntness from this source. “Origi- 
nally yes. But as it happened, the 
sum of money needed was beyond 
my immediate capital resources. 
Now, by a very curious coincidence. 
Sir Laurence Pitney had generously 
offered to finance my own experi- 
ments just prior to my initial meet- 
ing with the Count. I did not need 
his money then, of course, but it 
occurred to me that he might well 
be interested in the airship venture. 
The Count agreed on one-third 
interest each.” 

“Have you paid out any money, 
if 1 may ask?” 

Clarkson shook his head. “Hard- 
ly, Tom, While 1 am convinced of 
the man’s integrity, one must make 



certain of these things before one 
invests.” 

“1 wonder where he got the 
money for the prototype,” Dr. 
Flanagan mused. “According to 
my patients, it seems to be well 
enough built to fly last night.” 
Clarkson blinked. 

“Well, no matter,” Flanagan 
went on. “Am 1 permitted to know 
the motive power of this vessel? The 
technical details, so to speak? Or 
does he tly it all on electricity?” 
“No indeed,” Clarkson said. 
“The motive power is steam. That 
is to say, an air-screw is driven by 
steam power. The balloon gives a 
lift of 1,000 pounds.” 

The doctor’s eyebrows raised. 
“Are you sure of that figure?” 
Clarkson nodded. “He mention- 
ed it several times. Impressive, do 
you not think?” 

Dr. Flanagan set down his glass 
decisively. “Not impressive enough, 
dear Clarkson. The Count’s airship 
will not work.”

I T WAS a clear night, mild for the 
time of year. Clarkson was intro- 
verted. much of his confidence 
shattered by the events of the day. 
Flanagan, on the other hand, seem- 
ed to find release in talking. They 
walked across the common, en 
route to Clarkson’s home. The last 
witness had been interviewed. With 
only minor differences, the ac- 
counts tallied. 



THE AERIAL MACHINE 



149 




“Steam power,” Dr. Flanagan 
was saying, “does not require only 
machinery. It requires fuel; coal. 
And coal is heavy. So are batteries, 
if you intend to light your quarters 
by electricity. Or, if you use a 
generator, you have further weight 
problems there too. Add the neces- 
sity of a captain and crew. Add 
your gondola, your furnishings. 
Even without a single passenger, 
you have a weight far in excess of a 
thousand pounds.” 

“I feel a fool. Doctor. I cannot 
imagine why I could not have made 
such a simple calculation.” 

Flanagan glanced across at him. 
“You could have made it easily had 
you thought of it. But you did not 
because, my dear Clarkson, you are 
a man of science and you were 
faced with a problem of engineer- 
ing. The two are very different. 
There was also, if I may say so as a 
medical man, the question of the 
Count’s personality. From your ac- 
count he was — or is — a very im- 
pressive individual. Better men 
than you or 1 have failed to think 
clearly under the impact of an im- 
pressive personality." 

The soft blue glow of the street 
lamps showed in the distance, dif- 
fused by a light ground mist. 

Clarkson shook his head. “I can- 
not believe him more than a simple 
swindler.” 

“Nor 1,” agreed the doctor. 
“Even though he appears to have 
vanished now.” 

It was, Clarkson thought, a 



double mystery. They had called at 
the Count’s lodgings — or supposed 
lodgings — only to find no man of 
his title, and no man answering to 
his description, had ever stayed 
there. Inquiries throughout the 
town had failed to elicit any hint of 
him. 

“And yet,” said Clarkson pen- 
sively, “if not a swindler . 
what?” 

“He required you to keep the 
matter of the airship secret?” Dr. 
Flanagan asked. 

Clarkson nodded. 

“But he did not object to your 
telling Sir Laurence Pitney?” 
Clarkson glanced at him in sur- 
prise. “No, of course not.” 

“And I may assume that, like 
any decent husband, you shared 
the secret with your wife?” 

“Yes.” 

“And Pitney with his wife?” 
Puzzled, Clarkson said, “I would 
assume so.” 

“And, with the deepest respect to 
the ladies involved, are not women 
notorious for their inability to keep 
even the most minor secrets?” Be- 
fore Clarkson could reply, Flana- 
gan went on, “Besides, if our friend 
the Count really required secrecy, 
why would he choose to test his 
marvelous invention over so heavily 
populated an area?” 

“You are piling Pelion on Ossa 
where mystery is concerned,” 
Clarkson remarked. “I fear I fail to 
follow your train of thought.” 

The little doctor stopped. “You 



150 



GALAXY 




are forgetting one thing: although 
we are now both agreed that the 
Count’s marvelous airship could 
not possibly work, we have a dozen 
eye-witness accounts that it did 
work. It flew above this very town, 
electric lights blazing, no longer 
ago than last evening. What do you 
conclude from that, Clarkson?” 

Clarkson shook his head. “I have 
no conclusion,” he said helplessly. 

“1 have,” the doctor told him 
shortly. “Whatever flew over here 
last night was not the Count de 
Berg’s airship.” 

They walked on, slowly. For a 
time, Flanagan appeared sunk in 
reverie. Then he said suddenly, 
“Have you any military training, 
Charles?” 

“No.” 

“Nor have 1. But I once took an 
interest in tactics. A hobby, you 
might say, like your own chemical 
experiments. I learned the tech- 
niques by which one country may 
successfully invade another. You 
first send scouts to find out the lie 
of the land. If they are to survive, 
they have to pass for natives. That 
is to say, they must know the lingo 
and they must — at least superficial- 
ly — have the appearance of natives. 
If these scouts carry any equip- 
ment, it must be cunningly dis- 
guised. If, by its nature, it is im- 
possible to disguise, then the 
natives’ attention must be diverted 
from it. And should this be unsuc- 
cessful, the natives must be con- 
vinced that the equipment is really 



something else — something that 
will not alarm them. We have done 
this ourselves in Africa, convincing 
tribesmen that small arms are 
white man’s totem sticks and so 
forth.” Once again he stopped. 
“Perhaps our mysterious Count 
was a scout. Perhaps his talk of an 
airship was not meant to enlighten, 
but to confuse. Perhaps he meant 
the . secret ... to leak out, so 
that people would not guess the real 
nature of the craft which visited us 
last night.” 

As the implications sank in, 
Clarkson breathed. “You mean 
some foreign power plans an in- 
vasion of Britain?” 

The doctor’s face was impassive. 
“1 know of no nation which pos- 
sesses airships, Charles. I doubt if 
any European country could have 
constructed an aerial navy in abso- 
lute secrecy. But this concerns me 
less than a more serious 
question . .” 

“Which is?” asked Clarkson. 

The doctor looked directly at 
him. “If Count de Berg was a 
scout, 1 wonder when we might ex- 
pect the main invasion force?” 
Then Flanagan did a strange thing. 
He turned his face upward, so that 
he was staring out beyond the gas 
lamps to a sky filled with myriads 
of stars. “Although,” he added 
thoughtfully, “the main force may 
not arrive for quite some time; per- 
haps not for centuries. God alone 
must know how far it has to 
travel.” ♦

ANYONE involved in sf seems to be 
regarded by the lay public — 
and indeed by some readers — as 
flying saucer experts or flying 
saucer nuts. 1 don’t know which is 
the more irritating. My personal 
opinion on the whole subject, with 
which 1 respond to the inevitable 
questions on speaking tours, 
panels, and interviews is that yes, 
there are UFOs, and no, I have no 
opinions as to what they are, where 
they come from, or why, being per- 
fectly content to wait for further 
evidence — “hardware or bodies,” 
as the late Fletcher Pratt used to 
say. To hypothesize about them is 
legitimate; to construct hypothese 
into credos, to force them to carry a 
freight of personal prejudice, and 



to use them to attack established 
scientific search-and-sum-up tech- 
niques is only ludicrous. To attack 
some scientists and certain of the 
military for their “Let’s debunk 
this, whatever the evidence” 
and/or their .007ish “Whatever it 
is, it's restricted information,” is 
laudable. It seems to me a simple 
matter indeed to draw on every 
known observational technique, to 
make dispassionate summations, 
and to publish the results as they 
accrue. In the unlikely event that 
they are dangerous, we should 
know as soon as possible. In the 
event that they can give us some- 
thing of value, then let’s have it, as 
soon as possible. It seems to me 
that both the military and the 



152 




scientific communities need their 
credibilities laundered almost as 
urgently as the poluticians (an 
accidental typo, that, but ain’t it a 
beaut?) do. The latter have made 
themselves an easy target, but 
wouldn’t it be nice to live in a world 
where their statements, and 
military and scientific reports could 
be accepted comfortably with no 
grains of salt? Military secrecy has 
a pervasive side effect, feeding 
directly into the ego glands. In 
small kids it’s called “I know some- 
thing you don’t know.” In the 
brass, especially the lesser brass, it 
acts like shoe lifts, making one 
appear taller even when one knows 
one is not. This (to keep the meta- 
phors mixing) spills over into civi- 
lian government and the press. And 
scientists are by no means immune. 

What brings all this up is an in- 
teresting cluster of non-fiction 
which has accumulated here over 
the past few weeks. Beyond Earth. 
subtitled Man’s Contact with UFOs 
(Bantam, 248 pp., indexed and il- 
lustrated, $1.50) is by Ralph Blum 
with Judy Blum (what’s the differ- 
ence between that and Ralph Blum 
and Judy Blum?) and is the work of 
a hard-working professional jour- 
nalist. The Blums retread a lot of 
the indignant insistence of other 
writers in the field against official 
secrecy and stupidity in the area of 
UFOs. Although his “tilt” is to- 
ward the concept that these phe- 
nomena are extraterrestrial and in- 
telligently operated, he has the 



sense to conclude, in his final chap- 
ter, that (as Charles Fort once re- 
marked) any answer is not neces- 
sarily the only answer, and that we 
still seek a full explanation, I find 
immensely refreshing. There are 
times when his “tilt” tips his ob- 
jectivity, as in his too-ready accep- 
tance (I think) of certain “authori- 
ties” just because they have college 
degrees, and his startling ad 
hontinem attack on Carl Sagan; 
but by and large, his willingness to 
do homework, legwork and spade- 
work has produced one of the most 
sensible tomes yet written on the 
phenomenon. The folio of photo- 
graphs is truly mind-boggling and 
worth the price by itself. 



I NTERCEPT UFO by Renato Vesco 
(Zebra Books, 338 pp, illus- 
trated, annotated but not indexed, 
$1.95) has an interesting publish- 
ing history. The first copyright is 
Italian, the English translation 
1971. (I do not see a translator’s 
name. Whoever he is, he’s good.) 
Published in '71 by Grove Press, it 
was released as a paperback this 
past spring. The author, says the 
bookjacket, is the former head of 
the technical section of the Italian 
Air Force, and a senior member of 
the Italian Association of Aerotech- 
niques. In my judgment his knowl- 
edge of air technology is truly en- 
cyclopedic, as is his familiarity with 
the wartime and postwar history of 
aviation; as a matter of fact, were I 



153 




to be asked for a reference work in 
these areas. I’d unhesitatingly 
recommend this one, quite aside 
from its UFO content. It makes a 
formidable underpinning to his 
hypothesis that UFOs are real, and 
that they have, because logic and 
physics dictate that they must have, 
such and such a propulsion system, 
so and so lift factors. He avoids al- 
most completely any conjectures as 
to where they come from, and 
makes no shrill conclusions as to 
why. His enmity toward “ufolo- 
gists,” “contactees,” and the flying 
saucer crowd generally, is matched 
by his scorn for the military’s 
public relations tactics. He is con- 
vinced that they have been aware 
all along that the UFO’s are extra- 
terrestrial, with occasional panic 
suspicions that they are Soviet, and 
that they have been engaged for all 
these years in frantic secret effort to 
duplicate them and get them into 
the arsenal. The presumption is 
that the Soviets are doing the same. 
The result is, of course, an increas- 
ing lack of faith in government, in 
science, and in the military, by an 
informed and would-be informed 
public. Let us pray — let us also 
make noise! — that a new breeze 
may blow through secret corners of 
these establishments, that the us- 
and-them syndrome be dried up 
and blown away, that we begin to 
think as a thinking species which 
welcomes and shares all knowl- 
edge. Anyway ... if you have a 
shelf of UFO books, add these two. 



A NIGHT-TIME radio addict, I first 
heard of R.C.W. Ettinger on 
the old Long John Nebel show on 
WOR in the 50’s. John ran a 5 Vi- 
hour talkfest every night and really 
wrung his guests out. He had Et- 
tinger on several times and was 
himself heavily hooked on the man. 
And 1 suppose that’s understand- 
able. Ettinger’s idea of freezing 
people at the moment of death, so 
that they can be revived decades or 
centuries later, has a certain appeal 
to the ego. As a matter of fact, one 
might say that the greater the ego, 
the greater the appeal. It takes a 
very special kind of arrogance to as- 
sume that one is worth preserving, 
reviving, renewing indefinitely. It 
isn’t, 1 suspect, so much the spirit 
of adventure nor the prod of curi- 
osity about ages-to-come that con- 
stitutes this appeal; it’s the magic 
of Me, the conviction that “1” am 
worth preserving and rewarding. I 
am not the world’s humblest per- 
son, but 1 am realistic enough, I 
think, to permit whatever virtues 1 
possess to become genuinely post- 
humous, and to see the value of not 
being around to answer for my 
vices. As a resident of the far future 
with the power to resurrect any of 
countless rows of frozen stiffs, I 
think 1 would hesitate particularly 
to push the button marked 
Ettinger, for fear that the ego he so 
prizes, the ego that caused him to 
start his movement, the ego which 
drained so much of his real wealth 
into cold storage for so long, might 



154 



GALAXY 




be resurrected with him. Man into 
Superman (Avon, 288 pp, indexed, 
$1.50) is about the most opinion- 
ated packet of push you will ever 
hold in your hands. Superficially I 
have to agree with a great deal of 
what he says, and join him in what 
he attacks — the trend to stasis in so 
many millions of minds, the lack of 
the long view in favor of immediate 
gratification, the adherence to the 
outmoded, the forgiveness of so 
many irrationalities because, and 
only because, they have been 
around for so long. The carrot he 
holds out for us donkeys is his as- 
sertion that superman is inevitable, 
and that state or condition is within 
your personal reach. He goes on 
then to describe what it must be to 
be a superman, and how mutable, 
improvable, are all the aspects of 
You, body, mind, and spirit. For 
all that, 1 don’t think I could place 
myself at the mercy of some future 
generation which would be prepar- 
ed to thaw me out just because I am 
so damn wonderful. 1 think the 
likelihood is just as great that we 
will run out of the energy necessary 
to keep the icebox going, or that I 
will be revived for the protein in my 
liver and hams. Anyway, read the 
book. It might put the light of reve- 
lation in your eyes, and it might 
Hush some dust out of your veins 
through fury. At the very least he 
will force you to answer for your 
own convictions, a good many of 
which I'll bet you haven’t looked at 
for too long.

L OUIS Pauwels and Jacques 
Bergier, who wrote The 
Morning of the Magicians and 
created quite a stir a while back, 
have given us The Eternal Man 
(Avon, 254 pp, illustrated, with 
bibliography, $1.50). The Michael 
Heron translation (from the 
French) is crisp and articulate. The 
book might be described as van 
Daniken with scholarship, taste 
and style. The authors display their 
product and wait for you to 
examine it; they do not put a knee 
in your chest and shriek. Like that 
charioteer with the screaming 
axles, they feel that we have a 
legacy from very ancient sources, 
and those sources may not be of 
Earth. The Eternal Man, however, 
insists on nothing and, except by 
gentle illumination, does not at- 
tack. One such illumination is that 
science, as we know science, comes 
late to technological advancement. 
Some of the most astonishing and 
potent technological leaps were 
made by people absolutely ignorant 
of science and to whom science 
would be meaningless or worthless. 
To unhitch one’s mind from the 
axiom that the scientist is the dis- 
coverer, the engineer, the exploiter, 
is to elevate the doer, rather than 
the thinker, to a more deserving 
place. “The history of invention is 
boundless. The history of science is 
narrowly limited. Science is a river. 
Invention is an ocean. Science is 
mental conquest. Invention is the 



whole of nature at work in man. 
Science advances within the bounds 
of the possible. Invention is a blind 
victory over the impossible. In this 
sense, it is magic.” So state the 
authors, and go on to point out that 
it is magic that works, that has 
worked for more millennia than we 
have, until recently, been willing to 
acknowledge. It is so easy to fluff 
off this or that ancient culture as 
barbarian, because they had no 
science; so easy to believe that be- 
cause of this they were slant-browed 
trogs squatting in front of holes in 
the cliff, when in actuality they 
lived in complex societies full of 
technological wonders, in cultures 
already ancient. In our lifetime the 
origins of man have been pushed 
back from five to seven figures, and 
the thrust of this book is, not that 
the teachers from the stars are 
necessary to our history, but that 
there is less and less evidence that 
they did not come, more and more 
time in which they might have. Fas- 
cinating. And now I’m going off to 
build a version of a backyard seis- 
mograph (1 live in California; I was 
jolted by a 3.75 just this morning) 
which this book describes. It was 
invented in China by one Chang 
Heng, who was born in 78 a.d. and 
died in 139. It is simple and breath- 
takingly ingenious. Of course, 
Chang had access to a lot more seis- 
mology than 1. The Chinese study 
of earthquakes goes back to 780

DIRECTIONS 



Mr. Baen: 

1 enjoyed Poul Anderson’s article 
in the August issue very much, but 
I disagree with him on one point. I 
think that many science fiction 
readers do continue reading sf for 
much of their lives. I’m talking 
about people who read sf often. I 
realize that quite a few people read, 
say. The Terminal Man. then never 
touch another sf book. I don’t 
think that type of person can be 
considered to be someone who 
abandoned sf, he was never a Tru- 
reader in the first place. 

1 think that Mr. Anderson had 
Trureaders in mind, though. Isaac 
Asimov has said that after writing 
science fiction, everything else is 
downhill. This is also true of read- 
ing sf; when one quits reading it, 
what does he go on to? 

It’s true that science fiction often 
loses a long-time reader, Myrum J. 
Mudgett (Galaxy Directions, Aug.) 
is a good example. But he read sf 
for over forty years. Even now, he 
still wants to read it, but he doesn’t 
like what is now being written. 
That’s unfortunate, but not tragic. 
Mr. Mudgett is going to miss out 
on a lot by quitting now, but still, 
forty years is a long time. 

No, Mr. Anderson, I think that 



most sf readers keep at it for a long 
time. As I said, though, I did enjoy 
the rest of Poufs article, it’s one of 
the best I’ve seen on where science 
fiction has been, and where it’s 
going. 

You’re doing a very fine job on 
Galaxy and If, Mr. Baen. I es- 
pecially like Jerry Pournelle’s 
column in Galaxy, and Dick Geis’ 
in If. Please put better covers on If, 
though. They mar an otherwise ex- 
cellent magazine. 

Sincerely, 
Mark G. Scheuern 

Dear Jim Baen; 

1 am writing in reference to 
Alexei Panshin’s letter (Galaxy: 
July, 1974). Panshin writes ”... a 
new format with a better sense of 
the values of science fiction should 
sell strongly.” 1 wholeheartedly 
agree with this idea, but not his 
proposed approach to the matter. 

Alexei’s first complaint is of size. 
Personally, 1 prefer a magazine to 
look like a magazine (i.e. Vertex 
size). 8 'A by 10% size allows a 
magazine, like Vertex, to not look 
like “cheap digest magazines.” 
Pulp-sized magazines are not only 
ugly but very inconvenient to hold, 
carry, and store as opposed to S'/z x 
10% (or even digest size). 

The idea of an 8‘/2 by 10% maga- 
zine being lost by being put with 
other general-type magazines is il- 
logical. I truly doubt if a reader of 
Galaxy/If Vertex, or any other 
science-fiction magazine just reads 
sf. Chances are that sf readers look 
for other magazines of the 8% by 
10% size. too. If another person, 
who wouldn’t normally look for a 
science fiction magazine, picked up 



157 




and bought a sf magazine of this 
size because it was next to one of 
their favorite magazines and looked 
interesting, would this be so bad? 

As to the content of a new science 
fiction magazine, what Alexei Pan- 
shin outlines is a mainstream 
magazine. Science fiction maga- 
zines should be more aware of their 
times and include articles, reviews, 
and stories which reflect them, but 
only those which relate in some way 
to science fiction or fantasy. This 
relation should include science (as 
Vertex has) and books, movies, and 
records concerning science, science 
fiction and fantasy. Articles on 
comedians and performers have no 
place in a science fiction magazine. 
If a magazine included all things 
that reflected our times (as Panshin 
suggests), it might be excellent but 
it would not have those unique in- 
gredients that constitute a science 
fiction magazine. 

A science fiction magazine is a 
place where people who enjoy the 
hobby of sf can come together to 
write, read, and comment on it. I 
would like to see a science fiction 
magazine which includes good writ- 
ing of sf and its related fields (fan- 
tasy, horror, science, etc.) and in- 
teresting, thought-provoking com- 
ments on the writing and the field 
as a whole. 

(Galaxy/ If anA the other science 
fiction magazines seem to be com- 
ing closer to this idea. They seem to 
be giving more room to science and 
non-fictional articles, but are still — 
in the words of whomever wrote the 
ad for If in Galaxy — “Pulp Gone 
First Class.” Still closer to pulp 
than regular magazine.) 

This is the type of science fiction 



magazine I would like to read. It is 
perhaps a compromise between the 
Panshins’ idea, the pulps, and pre- 
sent-day magazines. And the type 
of magazine 1 hope the future will 
bring.

I must confess — I wrote that ad. 
And while my normal editorial ap- 
proach is not THE SHRIEK!!!, 
still, I meant every word of it. 

Dear Editor, 

In your July, 1974 issue Jerry 
Pournelle did an article on the 
American Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Science meeting. 
This article interested me very 
much and I would like to know if 
you are planning to do a follow-up 
article on some of the ideas he 
talked of. 

Also while reading your issue of 
Galaxy 1 read Dr. Asimov’s article. 
Question, Dear Doctor — are you 
sure nothing else can or will go 
wrong?

Jerry tells me that the meeting pro- 
vided a great deal of grist of his mill 
indeed. As for Dr. A — well. Dr. A?

entertained, it has predicted much of 
the far-ranging scientific and social 
change now upon us. 

In GALAXY, the finest authors of 
the genre continue to speculate, to 
predict, to tackle the prime problems 
already shaping tomorrow. Ecology- 
space exploration— nuclear promise 
and threat — energy— social evolution 
and biological revolution— these and
