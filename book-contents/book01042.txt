Secrets 
entrusted 
to a 
few 



THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told— things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

T WENTY minutes after the 
convict ship landed at the 
New York Spaceport, re- 
porters were allowed aboard. 
They came boiling up the main 
corridor, pushing against the 
heavily armed guards who were 
conducting them, the feature- 
story men and by-line columnists 
in the lead, the TV people with 
their portable but still-heavy 
equipment cursing along behind.

As they went, they passed lit- 
tle groups of spacemen in the 
black-and-red uniform of the In- 
terstellar Prison Service walking 
rapidly in the opposite direction, 
on their way to enjoy five days 
of planetside leave before the 
ship roared away once more with 
a new cargo of convicts. 

The impatient journalists bare- 
ly glanced at these drab person- 
alities who were spending their 
lives in a continuous shuttle from 
one end of the Galaxy to the 
other. After all, the life and ad- 
ventures of an IPS man had been 
done thousands of times, done 
to death. The big story lay ahead. 

In the very belly of the ship, 
the guards slid apart two enor- 
mous sliding doors — and quickly 
stepped aside to avoid being 
trampled. The reporters almost 
flung themselves against the iron 
bars that ran from floor to ceil-

S 



ing and completely shut off the 
great prison chamber. Their ea- 
ger, darting stares were met with 
by at most a few curious glances 
from the men in coarse gray suits 
who lay or sat in the tiers of 
bunks that rose in row after 
sternly functional row all the way 
down the cargo hold. Each man 
clutched — and some caressed 
— a small package neatly 
wrapped in plain brown paper. 

The chief guard ambled up on 
the other side of the bars, pick- 
ing the morning’s breakfast out 
of his front teeth. “Hi, boys,” he 
said. “Who’re you looking for — 
as if I didn’t know?” 

O NE of the older, more fa- 
mous columnists held the 
palm of his hand up warningly. 
“Look, Anderson: no games. The 
ship’s been almost a half-hour 
late in landing and we were 
stalled for fifteen minutes at the 
gangplank. Now where the hell 
are they?” 

Anderson watched the TV 
crews shoulder a place for them- 
selves and their equipment right 
up to the barrier. He tugged a 
last bit of food out of one of his 
molars. 

“Ghouls,” he muttered. “A 
bunch of grave-happy, funeral- 
hungry ghouls.” Then he hefted 
his club experimentally a couple 
of times and clattered it back 
and forth against the bars. “Cran- 

6 



dall!” he bellowed. “Henck! Front 
and center!” 

The cry was picked up by the 
guards strolling about, steadily, 
measuredly, club-twirlingly, in- 
side the prison pen. “Crandall! 
Henck! Front and center!” It 
went ricocheting authoritatively 
up and down the tremendous 
curved walls. “Crandall! Henck! 
Front and center!” 

Nicholas Crandall sat up cross- 
legged in his bunk on the fifth 
tier and grimaced. He had been 
dozing and now he rubbed a 
hand across his eyes to erase the 
sleep. There were three parallel 
scars across the back of his hand, 
old and brown and straight scars 
such as an animal’s claws might 
rake out. There was also a curi- 
ous zigzag scar just above his 
eyes that had a more reddish 
novelty. And there was a tiny, 
perfectly round hole in the mid- 
dle of his left ear which, after 
coming fully awake, he scratched 
in annoyance. 

“Reception committee,” he 
grumbled. “Might have known. 
Same old goddam Earth as ever.” 

He flipped over on his stom- 
ach and reached down to pat 
the face of the little man snoring 
on the bunk immediately under 
him. “Otto,” he called. “Blotto 
Otto — up and at ’em! They 
want us.” 

Henck immediately sat up in 
the same cross-legged fashion, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



even before his eyes had opened. 
His right hand went to his throat 
where there was a little network 
of zigzag scars of the same color 
and size as the one Crandall had 
on his forehead. The hand was 
missing an index and forefinger. 

“Henck here, sir,” he said 
thickly, then shook his head and 
stared up at Crandall. “Oh — 
Nick. What’s up?” 

“We’ve arrived, Blotto Otto,” 
the taller man said from the 
bunk above. “We’re on Earth and 
they’re getting our discharges 
ready. In about half an hour, 
you’ll be able to wrap that 
tongue of yours around as much 
brandy, beer, vodka and rotgut 
whiskey as you can pay for. No 
more prison-brew, no more raisin- 
jack from a tin can under the 
bed, Blotto Otto.” 

TTENCK grunted and flopped 
down on his back again. “In 
half an hour, but not now, so 
why did you have to go and wake 
me up? What do you take me 
for, some dewy, post-crime, petty- 
larceny kid, sweating out my dis- 
charge with my eyes open and 
my gut wriggling? Hey, Nick, I 
was dreaming of a new way to 
get Elsa, a brand-new, really ugly 
way.” 

“The screws are in an uproar,” 
Crandall told him, still in a low, 
patient voice. “Hear them? They 
want us, you and me.” 



Henck sat up again, listened 
a moment, and nodded. “Why is 
it,” he asked, “that only space- 
screws have voices like that?” 

“It’s a requirement of the serv- 
ice,” Crandall assured him. 
“You’ve got to be at least a mini- 
mum height, have a minimum 
education and with a minimum 
nasty voice of just the right ear- 
splitting quality before you can 
get to be a space-screw. Other- 
wise, no matter how vicious a 
personality you have, you are 
just plain out of luck and have 
to stay behind on Earth and go 
on getting your kicks by running 
down slowpoke ’copters driven 
by old ladies.” 

A guard stopped below, banged 
angrily at one of the metal posts 
that supported their tier of bunks. 
“Crandall! Henck! You’re still 
convicts, don’t you forget that! 
If you don’t front-and-center in 
a double-time hurry, I’ll climb 
up there and work you over once 
more for old-time’s sake!” 

“Yes, sir! Coming, sir!” they 
said in immediate, mumbling uni- 
son and began climbing down 
from bunk to bunk, each still 
clutching the brown-paper pack- 
age that contained the clothes 
they had once worn as free men 
and would shortly be allowed to 
wear again. 

“Listen, Otto.” Crandall leaned 
down as they climbed and 
brought his lips close' to the lit-

tie man’s ear in the rapid-fire, ex- 
tremely low-pitched prison whis- 
per. “They’re taking us to meet 
the television and news boys. 
We’re going to be asked a lot of 
questions. One thing you want 
to be sure to keep your lip but- 
toned about — ” 

“Television and news? Why 
us? What do they want with us?” 

“Because we’re celebrities, 
knockhead! We’ve seen it through 
for the big rap and come out on 
the other side. How many men 
do you think have made it? But 
listen, will you? If they ask you 
who it is you’re after, you just 
shut up and smile. You don’t an- 
swer that question. Got that? You 
don’t tell them whose murder 
you were sentenced for, no mat- 
ter what they say. They can’t 
make you. That’s the law.” 

Henck paused a moment, one 
and a half bunks from the floor. 
“But, Nick, Elsa knows! I told 
her that day, just before I turned 
myself in. She knows I wouldn’t 
take a murder rap for anyone 
but her!” 

“She knows, she knows, of 
course she knows!” Crandall 
swore briefly and almost inaudi- 
bly. “But she can’t prove it, you 
goddam human blotter! Once 
you say so in public, though, she’s 
entitled to arm herself and shoot 
you down on sight — pleading 
self-defense. And till you say so, 
she can’t; she’s still your poor 

8 



wife whom you’ve promised to 
love, honor and cherish. As far 
as the world is concerned — ” 

' | ''HE guard reached up with 
his club and jolted them both 
angrily across the back. They 
dropped to the floor and cringed 
as he snarled over them: “Did I 
say you could have a talk-party? 
Did 1? If we have any time left 
before you get your discharge, 
I’m taking you cuties into the 
guard-room for one last big go- 
ing-over. Now pick them up and 
put them down!” 

They scuttled in front of him 
obediently, like a pair of chick- 
ens before a snapping collie. At 
the barred gate near the end of 
the prison hold, he saluted and 
said: “Pre-criminals Nicholas 

Crandall and Otto Henck, sir.” 

Chief Guard Anderson wiped 
the salute back at him carelessly. 
“These gentlemen want to ask 
you fellas a couple of questions. 
Won’t hurt you to answer. That’s 
all, O’Brien.” 

His voice was very jovial. He 
was wearing a big, gentle, half- 
moon smile. As the subordinate 
guard saluted and moved away, 
Crandall let his mind regurgitate 
memories of Anderson all through 
this month-long trip from Prox- 
ima Centaurus. Anderson nodding 
thoughtfully as that poor Minelli 
— Steve Minelli, hadn’t that been 
his name? — was made to run 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



through a gauntlet of club-swing- 
ing guards for going to the toilet 
without permission. Anderson 
chuckling just a moment before 
he’d kicked a gray-headed con- 
vict in the groin for talking on 
the chow-line. Anderson — 

Well, the guy had guts, any- 
way, knowing that his ship car- 
ried two pre-criminals who had 
served out a murder sentence. 
But he probably also knew that 
they wouldn’t waste the murder 
on him, however viciously he 
acted. A man doesn’t volunteer 
for a hitch in hell just so he can 
knock off one of the devils. 

“Do we have to answer these 
questions, sir?” Crandall asked 
cautiously, tentatively. 

The chief guard’s smile lost 
the tiniest bit of its curvature. 
“I said it wouldn’t hurt you, 
didn’t I? But other things might. 
They still might, Crandall. I’d 
like to do these gentlemen from 
the press a favor, so you be nice 
and cooperative, eh?” He ges- 
tured with his chin, ever so 
slightly, in the direction of the 
guard-room and hefted his club 
a bit. 

“Yes, sir,” Crandall said, while 
Henck nodded violently. “We’ll 
be cooperative, sir.” 

Dammit, he thought, if only I 
didn’t have such a use for that 
murder! Let’s keep remembering 
Stephanson, boy, no one but 
Stephanson! Not Anderson, not 



O’Brien, not anybody else: the 
name under discussion is Fred- 
erick Stoddard Stephanson! 

W HILE the television men on 
the other side of the bars 
were fussing their equipment into 
position, the two convicts an- 
swered the preliminary, inevita- 
ble questions of the feature writ- 
ers: 

“How does it feel to be back?” 
“Fine, just fine.” 

“What’s the first thing you’re 
going to do when you get your 
discharge?” 

“Eat a good meal.” (From 
Crandall.) 

“Get roaring drunk.” (From 
Henck.) 

“Careful you don’t wind up 
right behind bars again as a 
post-criminal.” (From one of the 
feature writers.) A good-natured 
laugh in which all of them, the 
newsmen, Chief Guard Ander- 
son, and Crandall and Henck, 
participated. 

“How were you treated while 
you were prisoners?” 

“Oh, pretty good.” (From both 
of them, concurrent with a 
thoughtful glance at Anderson’s 
club.) 

“Either of you care to tell us 
who you’re going to murder?” 
(Silence.) 

“Either of you changed your 
mind and decided not to commit 
the murder?” 



TIME IN ADVANCE

(Crandall looked thoughtfully 
up, while Henck looked thought- 
fully down.) Another general 
laugh, a bit more uneasy this 
time, Crandall and Henck not 
participating. 

“All right, we’re set. Look this 
way, please,” the television an- 
nouncer broke in. “And smile, 
men — let’s have a really big 
smile.” 

Crandall and Henck dutifully 
emitted big smiles, which made 
three smiles, for Anderson had 
moved into the cheerful little 
group. 

The two cameras shot out of 
the grasp of their technicians, one 
hovering over them, one moving 
restlessly before their faces, both 
controlled, at a distance, by the 
little box of switches in the cam- 
eramen’s hands. A red bulb in 
the nose of one of the cameras 
lit up. 

“Here we are, ladies and gen- 
tlemen of the television audi- 
ence,” the announcer exuded in 
a lavish voice. “We are on board 
the convict ship Jean Valjean, 
which has just landed at the New 
York Spaceport. We are here to 
meet two men — two of the rare 
men who have managed to serve 
all of a voluntary sentence for 
murder and thus are legally en- 
titled to commit one murder 
apiece. 

“In just a few moments, they 
will be discharged after having 

10 



served out seven full years on 
the convict planets — and they 
will be free to kill any man or 
woman in the Solar System with 
absolutely no fear of any kind 
of retribution. Take a good look 
at them, ladies and gentlemen of 
the television audience — it 
might be you they are after!” 

A FTER this cheering thought, 
the announcer let a moment 
or two elapse while the cameras 
let their lenses stare at the two 
men in prison gray. Then he 
stepped into range himself and 
addressed the smaller man. 

“What is your name, sir?” he 
asked. 

“Pre - criminal Otto Henck, 

525514,” Blotto Otto responded 
automatically, though not able 
to repress a bit of a start at the 
sir. 

“How does it feel to be back?” 
“Fine, just fine.” 

“What’s the first thing you’re 
going to do when you get your 
discharge?” 

Henck hesitated, then said, 
“Eat a good meal,” after a shy 
look at Crandall. 

“How were you treated while 
you were a prisoner?” 

“Oh, pretty good. As good as 
you could expect.” 

“As good as a criminal could 
expect, eh? Although you’re not 
really a criminal yet, are you? 
You’re a pre-criminal.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Henck smiled as if this were 
the first time he was hearing the 
term. “That’s right, sir. I’m a pre- 
criminal.” 

“Want to tell the audience who 
the person is you’re going to be- 
come a criminal for?” 

Henck looked reproachfully at 
the announcer, who chuckled 
throatily — and alone. 

“Or if you’ve changed your 
mind about him or her?” There 
was a pause. Then the announcer 
said a little nervously: “You’ve 
served seven years on danger- 
filled, alien planets, preparing 
them for human colonization. 
That’s the maximum sentence 
the law allows, isn’t it?” 

“That’s right, sir. With the pre- 
criminal discount for serving the 
sentence in advance, seven years 
is the most you can get for mur- 
der.” 

“Bet you’re glad we’re not back 
in the days of capital punish- 
ment, eh? That would make the 
whole thing impractical, wouldn’t 
it? Now, Mr. Henck — or pre- 
criminal Henck, I guess I should 
still call you — suppose you tell 
the ladies and gentlemen of our 
television audience : What was 
the most horrifying experience 
you had while you were serving 
your sentence?” 

“Well,” Otto Henck considered 
carefully. “About the worst of 
the lot, I guess, was the time on 
Antares VIII, the second prison 



camp I was in, when the big 
wasps started to spawn. They 
got a wasp on Antares VIII, see, 
that’s about a hundred times the 
size of — ” 

“Is that how you lost those 
two fingers on your right hand?” 

TTENCK brought his hand up 
and studied it for a mo- 
ment. “No. The forefinger — I 
lost the forefinger on Rigel XII. 
We were building the first prison 
camp on the planet and I dug 
up a funny kind of red rock that 
had all sorts of little bumps on 
it. I poked it, kind of — you 
know, just to see how hard it 
was or something — and the tip 
of my finger disappeared. Pow — 
just like that. Later on, the whole 
finger got infected and the med- 
ics had to cut it off. 

“It turned out I was lucky, 
though; some of the men — the 
convicts, I mean — ran into big- 
ger rocks than the one I found. 
Those guys lost arms, legs — 
one guy even got swallowed 
whole. They weren’t really rocks, 
see. They were alive — they were 
alive and hungry! Rigel XII was 
lousy with them. The middle fin- 
ger — I lost the middle finger in 
a dumb kind of accident on board 
ship while we were being moved 
to — ” 

The announcer nodded intel- 
ligently, cleared his throat and 
said: “But those wasps, those gi- 



TIME IN ADVANCE 



11 



ant wasps on Antares VIII — 
they were the worst?” 

Blotto Otto blinked at him for 
a moment before he found the 
conversation again. 

“Oh. They sure were! They 
were used to laying their eggs in 
a kind of monkey they have on 
Antares VIII, see? It v«ras real 
rough on the monkey, but that’s 
how the baby wasps got their 
food while they were growing up. 
Well, we get out there and it 
turns out that the wasps can’t 
see any difference between those 
Antares monkeys and human be- 
ings. First thing you know, guys 
start collapsing all over the place 
and when they’re taken to the 
dispensary for an X-ray, the med- 
ics see that they’re completely 
crammed — ” 

“Thank you very much, Mr. 
Henck, but Herkimer’s Wasp has 
already been seen by and de- 
scribed to our audience at least 
three times in the past on the In- 
terstellar Travelogue, which is 
carried by this network, as you 
ladies and gentlemen no doubt 
remember, on Wednesday eve- 
nings from seven to seven-thirty 
p.m. terrestrial standard time. 
And now, Mr. Crandall, let me 
ask you, sir: How does it feel to 
be back?” 

Crandall stepped up and was 
put through almost exactly the 
same verbal paces as his fellow 
prisoner. 

12 



T^HERE was one major differ- 
ence. The announcer asked 
him if he expected to find Earth 
much changed. Crandall started 
to shrug, then abruptly relaxed 
and grinned. He was careful to 
make the grin an extremely wide 
one, exposing a maximum of 
tooth and a minimum of mirth. 

“There’s one big change I can 
see already,” he said. “The way 
those cameras float around and 
are controlled from a little 
switch-box in the cameraman’s 
hand. That gimmick wasn’t 
around the day I left. Whoever 
invented it must have been pretty 
clever.” 

“Oh, yes?” The announcer 
glanced briefly backward. “You 
mean the Stephanson Remote 
Control Switch? It was invented 
by Frederick Stoddard Stephan- 
son about five years ago — Was 
it five years, Don?” 

“Six years,” said the camera- 
man. “Went on the market five 
years ago.” 

“It was invented six years 
ago,” the announcer translated. 
“It went on the market five years 
ago.” 

Crandall nodded. “Well, this 
Frederick Stoddard Stephanson 
must be a clever man, a very 
clever man.” And he grinned 
again into the cameras. Look at 
my teeth, he thought to himself. 
I know you’re watching, Freddy. 
Look at my teeth and shiver. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The announcer seemed a bit 
disconcerted. “Yes,” he said. “Ex- 
actly. Now, Mr. Crandall, what 
would you describe as the most 
horrifying experience in your 
entire . .” 

After the TV men had rolled 
up their equipment and departed, 
the two pre-criminals were sub- 
jected to a final barrage of ques- 
tions from the feature writers and 
columnists in search of odd 
shreds of color. 

“What about the women in 
your life?” “What books, what 
hobbies, what amusements filled 
your time?” “Did you find out 
that there are no atheists on 
convict planets?” “If you had the 
whole thing to do over again — ” 

As he answered, drably, cour- 
teously, Nicholas Crandall was 
thinking about Frederick Stod- 
dard Stephanson seated in front 
of his luxurious wall-size televi- 
sion set. 

Would Stephanson have 
clicked it off by now? Would 
he be sitting there, staring at 
the blank screen, pondering the 
plans of the man who had out- 
lived odds estimated at ten 
thousand to one and returned 
after seven full, unbelievable 
years in the prison camps of 
four insane planets? 

W OULD Stephanson be ex- 
amining his blaster with 
sucked-in lips — the blaster that 



he might use only in an open- 
and-shut situation of self-defense 
if he wished to avoid the post- 
criminal sentence for murder, 
which, without the fifty per cent 
discount for punishment volun- 
tarily undergone in advance of 
the crime, was as much as four- 
teen years in the many-pronged 
hell from which he, Crandall, 
had just returned? 

Or would Stephanson be sit- 
ting, slumped in an expensive 
bubblechair, glumly watching a 
still-active screen, frightened out 
of his wits but still unable to 
tear himself away from the well- 
organized program the network 
had no doubt built around the 
return of two — count ’em: two! 
— homicidal pre-criminals? 

At the moment, in all proba- 
bility, the screen was showing an 
interview with some Earthside 
official of the Interstellar Prison 
Service, an expansive public re- 
lations character who had learned 
to talk in sociology. 

“Tell me, Mr. Public Rela- 
tions,” the announcer would ask 
(a different announcer, more se- 
rious, more intellectual), “how 
often do pre-criminals serve out 
a sentence for murder and re- 
turn?” 

“According to statistics — ” a 
rustle of papers at this point and 
a penetrating glance downward 
— “according to statistics, we 
may expect a man who has served

a full sentence for murder, with 
the 50 per cent pre-criminal dis- 
count, to return only once in 11.7 
years on the average.” 

“You would say, then, wouldn’t 
you, Mr. Public Relations, that 
the return of two such men on the 
same day is a rather unusual 
situation?” 

“Highly unusual or you tele- 
vision fellas wouldn’t be in such 
a fuss over it.” A thick chuckle 
here, which the announcer duti- 
fully echoes. 

*» ,And what, Mr. Public Rela- 
tions, happens to the others who 
don’t return?” 

A large, well-fed hand gestures 
urbanely. “They get killed. Or 
they give up. Those are the only 
two alternatives. Seven years is 
a long time to spend on those 
convict planets. The work sched- 
ule isn’t for sissies and neither 
are the life-forms they encounter 
— the big man-eating ones as well 
as the small virus-sized types. 

“That’s why prison guards get 
such high salaries and such long 
leaves. In a sense, you know, we 
haven’t really abolished capital 
punishment; we’ve substituted a 
socially useful form of Russian 
Roulette for it. Any man who 
commits or pre-commits one of a 
group of particularly reprehensi- 
ble crimes is sent off to a planet 
where his services will benefit 
humanity and where he’s forced 
to take his chances on coming 

14 



back in one piece, if at all. The 
more serious the crime, the longer 
the sentence and, therefore, the 
more remote the chances.” 

“I see. Now, Mr. Public Rela- 
tions, you say they either get 
killed or they give up. Would 
you explain to the audience, if 
you please, just how they give 
up and what happens if they 
do?” 

TTERE a sitting back in the 
chair, a locking of pudgy 
fingers over paunch. “You see, 
any pre-criminal may apply to 
his warden for immediate abro- 
gation of sentence. It’s just a 
matter of filling out the necessary 
forms. He’s pulled off work de- 
tail right then and there and is 
sent home on the very next ship 
out of the place. The catch is 
this: Every bit of time he’s 

served up to that point is can- 
celed — he gets nothing for it. 

“If he commits an actual 
crime after being freed, he has 
to serve the full sentence. If he 
wants to be committed as a pre- 
criminal again, he has to start 
serving the sentence, with the 
discount, from the beginning. 
Three out of every four pre- 
criminals apply for abrogation 
of sentence in their very first 
year. You get a bellyful fast in 
those places.” 

“I guess you certainly do,” 
agrees the announcer. “What 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



about the discount, Mr. Public 
Relations? Aren’t there people 
who feel that’s offering the pre- 
criminal too much inducement?” 

The barest grimace of anger 
flows across the sleek face, to be 
succeeded by a warm, contemptu- 
ous smile. “Those are people, I’m 
afraid, who, however well-inten- 
tioned, are not well versed in the 
facts of modern criminology and 
penology. We don’t want to dis- 
courage pre-criminals; we want 
to encourage them to turn them- 
selves in. 

“Remember what I said about 
three out of four applying for 
abrogation of sentence in their 
very first year? Now these are 
individuals who were sensible 
enough to try to get a discount 
on their sentence. Are they likely 
to be foolish enough to risk twice 
as much when they have found 
out conclusively they can’t stand 
a bare twelve months of it? Not 
to mention what they have dis- 
covered about the value of hu- 
man life, the necessity for social 
cooperation and the general de- 
sirability of civilized processes on 
those worlds where simple sur- 
vival is practically a matter of a 
sweepstakes ticket. 

“The man who doesn v apply 
for abrogation of sentence? Well, 
he has that much more time to 
let the desire to commit the 
crime go cold — and that much 
greater likelihood of getting 



killed with nothing to show for 
it. Therefore, so few pre-crimi- 
nals in any of the categories re- 
turn to tell the tale and do the 
deed that the social profit is ab- 
solutely enormous! Let me give 
you a few figures. 

“Using the Lazarus Scale, it 
has been estimated that the de- 
cline in premeditated homicides 
alone, since the institution of the 
pre-criminal discount, has been 
forty-one per cent on Earth, 
thirty-three and a third per cent 
on Venus, twenty-seven per 
cent — ” 

C OLD comfort, chillingly cold 
comfort, that would be to 
Stephanson, Nicholas Crandall 
reflected pleasurably, those for- 
ty-one per cents and thirty-three 
and a third per cents. Crandall’s 
was the balancing statistic: the 
man who wanted to murder, and 
for good and sufficient cause, one 
Frederick Stoddard Stephanson. 
He was a leftover fraction on a 
page of reductions and cancel- 
lations — he had returned, as- 
tonishingly, unbelievably, after 
seven years to collect the mer- 
chandise for which he had paid 
in advance. 

He and Henck. Two ridicu- 
lously long long-shots. Henck’s 
wife Elsa — was she, too, sitting 
in a kind of bird-hypnotized-by- 
a-snake fashion before her tele- 
vision set, hoping dimly and des-

perately that some comment of 
the Interstellar Prison Service 
official would show her how to 
evade her fate, how to get out 
from under the ridiculously rare 
disaster that was about to hap- 
pen to her? 

Well, Elsa was Blotto Otto’s 
affair. Let him enjoy it in his own 
way; he’d paid enough for the 
privilege. But Stephanson was 
Crandall’s. 

Oh, let the arrogant bean-pole 
sweat, he prayed. Let me take 
my time and let him sweat! 

The newsmen kept squeezing 
them for story angles until a 
loudspeaker in the overhead sud- 
denly cleared its diaphragm and 
announced : 

“Prisoners, prepare for dis- 
charge! You will proceed to the 
ship warden’s office in groups of 
ten, as your name is called. Con- 
vict ship discipline will be main- 
tained throughout. Arthur, Au- 
gluk, Crandall, Ferrara, Fu-Yen, 
Garfinkel, Gomez, Graham, 
Henck— ’’ 

A half hour later, they were 
walking down the main corridor 
of the ship in their civilian 
clothes. They showed their dis- 
charges to the guard at the gang- 
plank, smiled still cringingly back 
at Anderson, who called from a 
porthole, “Hey, fellas, come back 
soon!” and trotted down the in- 
cline to the surface of a planet 
they had not seen for seven ag- 

16 



onizing and horror-crowded years. 

There were a few reporters 
and photographers still waiting 
for them, and one TV crew which 
had been left behind to let the 
world see how they looked at 
the moment of freedom. 

Q UESTIONS, more questions 
to answer, which they could 
afford to be brusque about, al- 
though brusqueness to any but 
fellow prisoners still came hard. 

Fortunately, the newsmen got 
interested in another pre-crimi- 
nal who was with them. Fu-Yen 
had completed the discounted 
sentence of two years for aggra- 
vated assault and battery. He 
had also lost both arms and one 
leg to a corrosive moss on Pro- 
cyon III just before the end of 
his term and came limping down 
the gangplank on one real and 
one artificial leg, unable to grasp 
the hand-rails. 

As he was being asked, with a 
good deal of interest, just how 
he intended to commit simple 
assault and battery, let alone the 
serious kind, with his present 
limited resources, Crandall 
nudged Henck and they climbed 
quickly into one of the many 
hovering gyrocabs. They told 
the driver to take them to a 
bar — any quiet bar — in the 
city. 

Blotto Otto almost went to 
pieces under the impact of ac- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tual free choice. “I can’t do it,” 
he whispered. “Nick, there’s just 
too damn much to drink!” 

Crandall settled it by ordering 
for him. “Two double scotches,” 
he told the waitress. “Nothing 
else.” 

When the scotch came, Blotto 
Otto stared at it with the kind 
of affectionate and wistful aston- 
ishment a man might show to- 
ward an adolescent son whom 
he saw last as a babe in arms. He 
put out a gingerly, trembling 
hand. 

“Here’s death to our enemies,” 
Crandall said, and tossed his 
down. He watched Otto sip slow- 
ly and carefully, tasting each in- 
dividual drop. 

“You’d better take it easy,” he 
warned. “Elsa might have no 
more trouble from you than 
bringing flowers every visiting 
day to the alcoholic ward.” 

“No fear,” Blotto Otto growled 
into his empty glass. “I was 
weaned on this stuff. And, any- 
way, it’s the last drink I have un- 
til I dump her. That’s the way 
I’ve been figuring it, Nick: one 
drink to celebrate, then Elsa. I 
didn’t go through those seven 
years to mess myself up at the 
payoff.” 

TTE SET the glass down. “Sev- 
en years in one steaming 
hell after another. And before 
that, twelve years with Elsa. 



Twelve years with her pulling 
every dirty trick in the book on 
me, laughing in my face, telling 
me she was my wife and had me 
legally where she wanted me, 
that I was gonna support her the 
way she wanted to be supported 
and I was gonna like it. And if 
I dared to get off my knees and 
stand on my hind legs, pow, she 
found a way to get me arrested. 

“The weeks I spent in the cool- 
er, in the workhouse, until Elsa 
would tell the judge maybe I’d 
learned my lesson, she was will- 
ing to give me one more chance! 
And me begging for a divorce on 
my knees — hell, on my belly! 
— no children, she’s able-bodied, 
she’s young, and her laughing in 
my face. When she wanted me 
in the cooler, see, then she’s cry- 
ing in front .of the judge; but 
when we’re alone, she’s always 
laughing her head off to see me 
squirm. 

“I supported her, Nick. Hon- 
est, I gave her almost every cent 
I made, but that wasn’t enough. 
She liked to see me squirm; she 
told me she did. Well, who’s 
squirming now?” He grunted 
deep in his throat. “Marriage — • 
it’s for chumps!” 

Crandall looked out of the 
open window he was sitting 
against, down through the dizzy, 
busy levels of Metropolitan New 
York. 

“Maybe it is,” he said thought- 



TIME IN ADVANCE 



17 



fully. “I wouldn’t know. My mar- 
riage was good while it lasted, 
five years of it. Then, all of a 
sudden, it wasn’t good any more, 
just so much rancid butter.” 

“At least she gave you a di- 
vorce,” said Henck. “She didn’t 
take you.” 

“Oh, Polly wasn’t the kind of 
girl to take anyone. A little mixed 
up, but maybe no more than I 
was. Pretty Polly, I called her; 
Big Nick, she called me. The 
starlight faded and so did I, I 
guess. I was still knocking my- 
self out then trying to make a 
go out of the wholesale electron- 
ics business with Irv. Anyone 
could tell I wasn’t cut out to be 
a millionaire. Maybe that was it. 
Anyway, Polly wanted out and 
I gave it to her. We parted 
friends. I wonder, every once in 
a while, what she’s — ” 

There was a slight splashy 
noise, like a seal’s flipper making 
a gesture in the water. Crandall’s 
eyes came back to the table a 
moment after the green, melon- 
like ball had hit it. And, at the 
same instant, Henck’s hand had 
swept the ball up and hurled it 
through the window. The long, 
green threads streamed out of 
the ball, but by then it was fall- 
ing down the side of the enor- 
mous building and the threads 
found no living flesh to take 
root in.\ 

From the corner of his eye, 



Crandall had seen a man bolt 
out of the bar. By the way peo- 
ple kept looking back and forth 
fearfully from their table to the 
open doorway, he deduced that 
the man had thrown it. Evident- 
ly Stephanson had thought it 
worthwhile to have Crandall fol- 
lowed and neutralized. 

T> LOTTO OTTO saw no point 
in preening over his re- 
flexes. The two of them had 
learned to move fast a long 
time ago — " over a lot of dead 
bodies. “A Venusian dandelion 
bomb,” he observed. “Well, at 
least the guy doesn’t want to 
kill you, Nick. He just wants to 
cripple you.” 

“That would be Stephanson’s 
style,” Crandall agreed, as they 
paid their check and walked past 
the faces which were just now 
beginning to turn white. “He’d 
never do it himself. He’d hire a 
bully-boy. And he’d do the hir- 
ing through an intermediary just 
in case the bully-boy ever got 
caught and blabbed. But that 
still wouldn’t be safe enough: he 
wouldn’t want to risk a post- 
criminal murder charge. 

“A dose of Venusian dande- 
lion, he’d figure, and he wouldn’t 
have to worry about me for the 
rest of my life. He might even 
come to visit me in the home for 
incurables — like the way he sent 
me a card every Christmas of my 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



sentence. Always the same mes- 
sage: ‘Still mad? Love, Freddy.’” 

“Quite a guy, this Stephanson,” 
Blotto Otto said, peering around 
the entrance carefully before 
stepping out of the bar and onto 
the fifteenth level walkway. 

“Yeah, quite a guy. He’s got 
the world by the tail and every 
once in a while, just for fun, he 
twists the tail. I learned how he 
operated when we were room- 
mates way back in college, but 
do you thing that did me any 
good? I ran into him just when 
that wholesale electronics busi- 
ness with Irv was really falling 
apart, about two years after I 
broke up with Polly. 

“I was feeling blue and I 
wanted to talk to someone, so I 
told him all about how my part- 
ner was a penny-watcher and I 
was a big dreamer, and how be- 
tween us we were turning a pos- 
sible nice small business into a 
definite big bankruptcy. And 
then I got onto this remote-con- 
trol switch I’d been fooling 
around with and how I wished 
I had time to develop it.” 

Blotto Otto kept glancing 
around uneasily, not from dread 
of another assassin, but out of 
the unexpected sensation of do- 
ing so much walking of his own 
free will. Several passersby 
turned around to have another 
stare at their out-of-fashion knee- 
length tunics. 



“So there I was,” Crandall 
went on. “I was a fool, I know, 
but take my word, Otto, you 
have no idea how persuasive and 
friendly a guy like Freddy Ste- 
phanson can be. He tells me he 
has this house in the country he 
isn’t using right now and there’s 
a complete electronics lab in the 
basement. It’s all mine, if I want 
it, as long as I want it, starting 
next week; all I have to worry 
about is feeding myself. And he 
doesn’t want any rent or any- 
thing — it’s for old time’s sake 
and because he wants to see me 
do something really big in the 
world. 

“How smart could I be with a 
con-artist like that? It wasn’t till 
two years later that I realized he 
must have had the electronics 
lab installed the same week I was 
asking Irv to buy me out of the 
business for a couple of hundred 
credits. After all, what would 
Stephanson, the owner of a bro- 
kerage firm, be doing with an 
electronics lab of his own? But 
who figures such things when an 
old roommate’s so warm and 
friendly and interested in you?” 

/"kTTO sighed. “So he comes up 
to see you every few weeks. 
And then, about a month after 
you’ve got it all finished and work- 
ing, he locks you out of the place 
and moves all your papers and 
stuff to another joint. And he

19 



tells you he’ll have it patented 
long before you can get it all 
down on paper again, and any- 
how it was his place — he can al- 
ways claim he was subsidizing 
you. Then he laughs in your 
face, just like Elsa. Huh, Nick?” 

Crandall bit his lip as he real- 
ized how thoroughly Otto Henck 
must have memorized the mate- 
rial. How many times had they 
gone over each other’s planned 
revenge and the situations which 
had motivated it? How many 
times had they told and retold 
the same bitter stories to each 
other, elicited the same re- 
sponses from each other, the 
same questions, the same agree- 
ments and even the very same 
disagreements? 

Suddenly, he wanted to get 
away from the little man and 
enjoy the luxury of loneliness. 
He saw the sparkling roof of a 
hotel two levels down. 

“Think I’ll move into that. 
Ought to be thinking about a 
place to sleep tonight.” 

Otto nodded at his mood rath- 
er than at his statement. “Sure. 

I know just how you feel. But 
that’s pretty plush, Nick: The 
Capricorn-Ritz. At least twelve 
credits a day.” 

“So what? I can live high for 
a week, if I want to. And with 
my background, I can always . 
pick up a fast job as soon as I 
get low. I want something plush 

20 



for tonight, Blotto Otto.” 

“Okay, okay. You got my ad- 
dress, huh, Nick? I’ll be at my 
cousin’s place.” 

“I have it, all right. Luck with 
Elsa, Otto.” 

“Thanks. Luck with Freddy. 
Uh — so long.” The little man 
turned abruptly and entered a 
main street elevator. When the 
doors slid shut, Crandall found 
that he was feeling very uncom- 
fortable. Henck had meant more 
to him than his own brother. Well, 
after all, he’d been with Henck 
day and night for a long time 
now. And he hadn’t seen Dan 
for — how long was it? — almost 
nine years. 

He reflected on how little he 
was attached to the world, if you 
excluded the rather negative de- 
sire of removing Stephanson from 
it. One thing he should get soon 
was a girl — almost any girl. 

But, come to think of it, there 
was something he needed even 
more. 

TTE WALKED swiftly to the 
nearest drugstore. It was 
a large one, part of a chain. And 
there, featured prominently in 
the window, was exactly what he 
wanted. 

At the cigar counter, he said 
to the clerk: “It’s pretty cheap. 
Do they work all right?” 

The clerk drew himself up. 
“Before we put an item on sale, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



sir, it is tested thoroughly. We 
are the largest retail outlet in 
the Solar System — that’s why 
it’s so cheap.” 

“All right. Give me the me- 
dium-sized one. And two boxes 
of cartridges.” 

With the blaster in his posses- 
sion, he felt much more secure. 
He had a good deal of confidence 
— based on years of escaping 
creatures with hair-trigger ner- 
vous systems — in his ability 
to duck and wriggle and jump to 
one side. But it would be nice 
to be able to fight back. And 
how did he know how soon Ste- 
phanson would try again? 

He registered under a false 
name, a ruse he thought of at 
the last moment. That it wasn’t 
worth much, as ruses went, he 
found out when the bellhop, aft- 
er being tipped, said: “Thank 
you, Mr. Crandall. I hope you 
get your victim, sir.” 

So he was a celebrity. Prob- 
ably everyone in the world knew 
exactly what he looked like. All 
of which might make it a bit more 
difficult to get at Stephanson. 

While he was taking a bath, 
he asked the television set to 
check through Information’s file 
on the man. Stephanson had been 
rich and moderately important 
seven years ago; with the Ste- 
phanson Switch — how do you 
like that, the Stephanson Switch! 
— he must be even richer now 



and much more important. 

He was. The television set in- 
formed Crandall that in the last 
calendar month, there were six- 
teen news items relating to Fred- 
erick Stoddard Stephanson. Cran- 
dall considered, then asked for 
the most recent. 

That was datelined today. 
“Frederick Stephanson, the pres- 
ident of the Stephanson Invest- 
ment Trust and Stephanson Elec- 
tronics Corporation, left early 
this morning for his hunting lodge 
in Central Tibet. He expects to 
remain there for at least — ” 

“That’s enough!” Crandall 
called through the bathroom door. 

Stephanson was scared! The 
arrogant bean-pole was fright- 
ened silly! That was something; 
in fact, it was a large part of 
the return on those seven years. 
Let him seethe in his own sweat 
for a while, until he found the 
actual killing, when it did come 
at last, almost welcome. 

/'"’RANDALL asked the set for 
the fresh news and was im- 
mediately treated to a bulletin 
about himself and how he had 
registered at the Capricorn-Ritz 
under the name of Alexander 
Smathers. “But neither is the 
correct name, ladies and gentle- 
men,” the playback rolled out 
unctuously. “Neither Nicholas 
Crandall nor Alexander Smathers 
is the right name for this man. 



TIME IN ADVANCE 



21 



There is only one name for that 
man — and that name is death! 
Yes, the grim reaper has taken 
up residence at the Ritz-Capri- 
corn Hotel tonight, and only he 
knows which one of us will not 
see another sunrise. That man, 
that grim reaper, that deputy of 
death, is the only one among 
us who knows — ” 

“Shut up!” Crandall yelled, ex- 
asperated. He had almost for- 
gotten the kind of punishment a 
free man was forced to endure. 

The private phone circuit on 
the television screen lit up. He 
dried himself, hurried into clothes 
and asked, “Who’s calling?” 

“Mrs. Nicholas Crandall,” said 
the operator’s voice. 

He stared at the blank screen 
for a moment, absolutely thunder- 
struck. Polly! Where in the world 
had she come from? And how did 
she know where he was? No, the 
last part was easy — he was a 
celebrity. 

“Put her on,” he said at last. 

Polly’s face filled the screen. 
Crandall studied her quizzically. 
She’d aged a bit, but possibly it 
wasn’t obvious at anything but 
this magnification. 

As if she realized it herself, 
Polly adjusted the controls on 
her set and her face dwindled to 
life-size, the rest of her body as 
well as her surroundings coming 
into the picture. She was evi- 
dently in the living room of her 

22 



home; it looked like a low-to- 
middle-income-range furnished 
apartment. But she looked good 
— awfully good. There were such 
warm memories . 

“Hi, Polly. What’s this all 
about? You’re the last person I 
expected to call me.” 

“Hello, Nick.” She lifted her 
hand to her mouth and stared 
over its knuckles for some time 
at him. Then: “Nick. Please. 
Please don’t play games with me.” 
He dropped into a chair. 
“Huh?” 

S HE began to cry. “Oh, Nick! 

Don’t! Don’t be that cruel! I 
know why you served that sen- 
tence — those seven years. The 
moment I heard your name today, 
I knew why you did it. But, Nick, 
it was only one man — just one 
man, Nick!” 

“Just one man what?” 

“It was just that one man I was 
unfaithful with. And I thought he 
loved me, Nick. I wouldn’t have 
divorced you if I’d known what 
he was really like. But you know, 
Nick, don’t you? You know how 
much he made me suffer. I’ve 
been punished enough. Don’t kill 
me, Nick! Please don’t kill me!” 
“Listen, Polly,” he began, com- 
pletely confused. “Polly girl, for 
heaven’s sake — ” 

“Nick!” she gulped hysterically. 
“Nick, it was over eleven years 
ago — ten, at least. Don’t kill me 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



for that, please, Nick! Nick, truly, 
I wasn’t unfaithful to you for 
more than a year, two years at 
the most. Truly, Nick! And, Nick, 
it was only that one affair — the 
others didn’t count. They were 
just — just casual things. They 
didn’t matter at all, Nick! But 
don’t kill me! Don’t kill me!” 
She held both hands to her face 
and began rocking back and 
forth, moaning uncontrollably. 

Crandall stared at her for a 
moment and moistened his lips. 
Then he said, “Whew!” and turned 
the set off. He leaned back in his 
chair. Again he said, “Whew!” and 
this time it hissed through his 
teeth. 

Polly! Polly had been unfaith- 
ful during their marriage. For a 
year — no, two years! And — what 
had she said? — the others, the 
others had just been casual things! 

The woman he had loved, the 
woman he suspected he had al- 
ways loved, the woman he had 
given up with infinite regret and 
a deep sense of guilt when she 
had come to him and said that 
the business had taken the best 
part of him away from her, but 
that since it wasn’t fair to ask him 
to give up something that obvi- 
ously meant so much to him — 

Pretty Polly. Polly girl. He’d 
never thought of another woman 
in all their time together. And if 
anyone, anyone at all, had ever 
suggested — had so much as hinted 



— he’d have used a monkey 
wrench on the meddler’s face. 
He’d given her the divorce only 
because she’d asked for it, but 
he’d hoped that when the business 
got on its feet and Irv’s book- 
keeping end covered a wider 
stretch of it, they might get back 
together again. Then, of course, 
business grew worse, Irv’s wife 
got sick and he put even less time 
in at the office and — 

“I feel,” he said to himself num- 
bly, “as if I’ve just found out for

Claus. Not Polly, not all those 
good years! One affair! And the 
others were just casual things!” 

HP HE telephone circuit went off 
again. “Who is it?” he snarled. 
“Mr. Edward Ballaskia.” 
“What’s he want?” Not Polly, 
not Pretty Polly! 

An extreme fat man came on 
the screen. He looked to right 
and left cautiously. “I must ask 
you, Mr. Crandall, if you are 
positive that this line isn’t tapped.” 
“What the hell do you want?” 
Crandall found himself wishing 
that the fat man were here in per- 
son. He’d love to sail into some- 
body right now. 

Mr. Edward Ballaskia shook 
his head disapprovingly, his jowls 
jiggling slowly behind the rest of 
his face. “Well, then, sir, if you 
won’t give me you assurances, I 
am forced to take a chance. I am

calling, Mr. Crandall, to ask you 
to forgive your enemies, to turn 
the other cheek. I am asking you 
to remember faith, hope and char- 
ity — and that the greatest of 
these is charity. In other words, 
sir, open your heart to him or her 
you intended to kill, understand 
the weaknesses which caused 
them to give offenses — and for- 
give them.” 

“Why should I?”’ Crandall de- 
manded. 

“Because it is to your profit 
to do so, sir. Not merely morally 
profitable — although let us not 
overlook the life of the spirit — 
but financially profitable. Finan- 
cially profitable, Mr. Crandall.” 

“Would you kindly tell me 
what you are talking about?” 

The fat man leaned forward 
and smiled confidentially. “If you 
can forgive the person who caused 
you to go off and suffer seven 



long, seven miserable years of 
acute discomfort, Mr. Crandall, I 
am prepared to make you a most 
attractive offer. You are entitled 
to commit one murder. I desire 
to have one murder committed. I 
am very wealthy. You, I judge — 
and please take no umbrage, sir 
— are very poor. 

“I can make you comfortable 
for the rest of your life, extremely 
comfortable, Mr. Crandall, if only 
you will put aside your thoughts, 
your unworthy thoughts, of anger 
and personal vengeance. I have a 
business competitor, you see, who 
has been — ” 

Crandall turned him off. “Go 
serve your own seven years,” he 
venomously told the blank screen. 
Then, suddenly, it was funny. He 
lay back in the chair and laughed 
his head off. 

That butter-faced old slob! 
Quoting religious texts at him!

T> UT the call had served a 
purpose. Somehow it put the 
scene with Polly in the perspec- 
tive of ridicule. To think of the 
woman sitting in her frowsy lit- 
tle apartment, trembling over her 
dingy affairs of more than ten 
years ago! To think she was 
afraid he had bled and battled 
for seven years because of that! 

He thought about it for a mo- 
ment, then shrugged. “Well, any- 
way, I bet it did her good.” 

And now he was hungry. 

He thought of having a meal 
sent up, just to avoid a possible 
rendezvous with' another of Ste- 



phanson’s ball-throwers, but de- 
cided against it. If Stephanson was 
really hunting him seriously, it 
would not be much of a job to 
have something put into the food 
he was sent. He’d be much safer 
eating in a restaurant chosen at 
random. 

Besides, a few bright lights, a 
little gaiety, would be really wel- 
come. This was his first night of 
freedom — and he had to wash 
that Polly taste out of his mouth. 

He checked the corridor care- 
fully before going out. There was 
nothing, but the action reminded 
him of a tiny planet near Vega

where you made exactly the same 
precautionary gesture every time 
you emerged from one of the tun- 
nels formed by the long, parallel 
lines of moist, carboniferous ferns. 

Because if you didn’t — well, 
there was an enormous leechlike 
mollusc that might be waiting 
there, a creature which could 
flip chunks of shell with prodigi- 
ous force. The shell merely stun- 
ned its prey, but stunned it long 
enough for the leech to get in 
close. 

And that leech could empty 
a man in ten minutes flat. 

Once he’d been hit by a frag- 
ment of shell, and while he’d been 
lying there, Henck — Good old 
Blotto Otto! Crandall smiled. Was 
it possible that the two of them 
would look back on those hideous 
adventures, one day, with actual 
nostalgia, the kind of beery, pleas- 
ant memories that soldiers de- 
velop after even the ugliest of 
wars? Well, and if they did, they 
hadn’t gone through them for the 
sake of fat cats like Mr. Edward 
Ballaskia and his sanctified 
dreams of evil. 

Nor, when you came right down 
to it, for dismal little frightened 
trollops like Polly. 

Frederick Stoddard Stephan- 
son. Frederick Stoddard — 

Somebody put an arm on his 
shoulder and he came to, reali- 
zing that he was halfway through 
the lobby.

“Nick,” said a rather familiar 
voice. 

Crandall squinted at the face 
at the end of the arm. That 
slight, pointed beard — he didn’t 
know anyone with a beard like 
that, but the eyes looked so terri- 
bly familiar .... 

“Nick,” said the man with the 
beard. “I couldn’t do it.” 

T HOSE eyes — of course, it was 
his younger brother! 

“Dan!” he shouted. 

“It’s me all right. Here.” Some- 
thing clattered to the floor. Cran- 
dall looked down and saw a blas- 
ter lying on the rug, a larger and 
much more expensive blaster than 
the one he was carrying. Why 
was Dan toting a blaster? Who 
was after Dan? 

With the thought, there came 
half-understanding. And there was 
fear — fear of the words that might 
come pouring out of the mouth 
of a brother whom he had not 
seen for all these years . 

“I could have killed you from 
the moment you walked into the 
lobby,” Dan was saying. “You 
weren’t out of the sights for a sec- 
ond. But I want you to know, 
Nick, that the post-criminal sen- 
tence wasn’t the reason I froze 
on the firing button.” 

“No?” Crandall asked in a 
breath that was exhaled slowly 
through a retroactive lifetime. 

“I just couldn’t stand adding

any more guilt about you. Ever 
since that business with Polly — ” 
“With Polly. Yes, of course, 
with Polly.” Something seemed to 
hang like a weight from the point 
of his jaw; it pulled his head 
down and his mouth open. “With 
Polly. That business with Polly.” 
Dan punched his fist into an 
open palm twice. “I knew you’d 
come looking for me sooner or 
later. I almost went crazy waiting 
— and I did go nearly crazy with 
guilt. But I never figured you’d 
do it this way, Nick. Seven years 
to wait for you to come back!” 
“That’s why you never wrote 
to me, Dan?” 

“What did I have to say? What 
is there to say? I thought I loved 
her, but I found out what I meant 
to her as soon as she was divorced. 
I guess I always wanted what was 
yours because you were my older 
brother, Nick. That’s the only ex- 
cuse I can offer and I know ex- 
actly what it’s worth. Because I 
know what you and Polly had to- 
gether, what I broke up as a kind 
of big practical joke. But one 
thing, Nick: I won’t kill you and 
I won’t defend myself. I’m too 
tired. I’m too guilty. You know 
where to find me. Anytime, Nick.” 
He turned and strode rapidly 
through the lobby, the metal 
spangles that were this year’s 
high masculine fashion glittering 
on his calves. He didn’t look back, 
even when he was walking past 



the other side of the clear plastic 
that enclosed the lobby. 

Crandall watched him go, then 
said “Hm” to himself in a lonely 
kind of way. He reached down, 
retrieved the other blaster and 
went out to find a restaurant. 

A She sat, poking around in the 
spiced Venusian food that 
wasn’t one-tenth as good as 
he had remembered it, he kept 
thinking about Polly and Dan. 
The incidents — he could remem- 
ber incidents galore, now that he 
had a couple of pegs on which to 
hang them. To think he’d never 
suspected — but who could sus- 
pect Polly, who could suspect 
Dan? 

He pulled the prison discharge 
out of his pocket and studied it. 
Having duly served a maximum 
penal sentence of seven years, 
discounted from fourteen years, 
Nicholas Crandall is herewith dis- 
charged in a pre-criminal status — 

— to murder his ex-wife, Polly 
Crandall? 

— to murder his younger 
brother, Daniel Crandall? 

Ridiculous! 

But they hadn’t found it so 
ridiculous. Both of them, so bliss- 
fully secure in their guilt, so ego- 
tistically certain that they and 
they alone were the objects of 
a hatred intense enough to en- 
dure the worst that the Galaxy 
had to offer in order to attain

vengeance — why, they had both 
been so positive that their nor- 
mal and already demonstrated 
cunning had deserted them and 
they had completely misread the 
warmth in his eyes! Either one 
could have switched confessions 
in mid-explanation. If they had 
only not been so preoccupied 
with self and had noted his as- 
tonishment in time, either or both 
of them could still be deceiving 
him! 

Out of the corner of his eye, 
he saw that a woman was stand- 
ing near his table. She had been 
reading his discharge over his 
shoulder. He leaned back and 
took her in while she stood and 
smiled at him. 

She had everything a woman 
needs for great beauty — figure, 
facial structure, complexion, car- 
riage, eyes, hair, all these to per- 
fection — but she had those other 
final touches that make the dif- 
ference between a mere beauty 
and a work of art. Those final 
touches included such things as 
sufficient wealth to create the ul- 
timate setting in coiffure and 
gown, as well as the single Sat- 
urnian paeaea stone glowing in 
priceless black splendor between 
her breasts. Those final touches 
included the look of feminine in- 
telligence in her large eyes, and 
the overbred, overindulged, over- 
spoiled quality that chilled while 
attracting desire. 

28 



“May I sit with you, Mr. Cran- 
dall?” she asked in a voice of 
which no more could be said than 
that it fitted the rest of her. 

COMEWHAT amused, but 
^ more exhilarated than 
amused, he slid over on the res- 
taurant couch. She sat down like 
an empress taking her throne be- 
fore the eyes of a hundred tribu- 
tary kings. 

Crandall knew, within approxi- 
mate limits, who she was and 
what she wanted. She was either 
a reigning post-debutante from 
the highest social circles in the 
System, or a theatrical star newly 
arrived and still in a state of 
nova. 

And he, as a just-discharged 
convict, with the power of life 
and death in his hands, repre- 
sented a taste she had not yet 
been able to indulge but was de- 
termined to enjoy. 

Well, in a sense it wasn’t flat- 
tering, but a woman like this 
could only fall to the lot of an 
ordinary man in very exceptional 
circumstances; he might as well 
take advantage of his status. He 
would satisfy her whim, while 
she, on his first night of free- 
dom — 

“That’s your discharge, isn’t 
it?” she asked and looked at it 
again. There was a moist bead- 
ing on her upper lip as she avidly 
studied it — what a strange, sati- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ated animal for one so splendidly 
young! 

“Tell me, Mr. Crandall,” she 
asked at last, turning to him with 
the wet pinpoints above her lip 
more brilliant than ever. “You’ve 
served a pre-criminal sentence 
for murder. It is true, is it not, 
that the punishment for murder 
and the most brutal, degraded 
rape imaginable are exactly the 



he’d be unlikely to try another 
for some time. 

But that girl! And Edward 
Ballaskia! 

There was a message in his 
box. Someone had called, leaving 
only a number to be called back. 

Now what? he wondered as he 
went back up to his room. Ste- 
phanson making overtures? Or 




same?” 

After a long, sick silence, Cran- 
dall called for his check and 
walked out of the restaurant. 

TT E had subsided enough when 
he reached the hotel to 
stroll with care around the trans- 
parent lobby housing. No one 
who looked like a Stephanson 
trigger man was in sight, although 
Stephanson was a cautious gam- 
bler. One attempt having failed,

some unhappy mother wanting 
him to murder her incurable 
child? 

H E GAVE the number to the 
set and sat down to watch 
the screen with a good deal of 
curiosity. 

It flickered — a face took shape 
on it. Crandall barely restrained 
a cry of delight. He did have a 
friend in this city from pre-con- 
vict days. Good old dependable, 
plodding, realistic Irv. His old 
partner. 

And then, just as he was about 
to shout an enthusiastic greeting, 
he locked it inside his mouth. 
Too many things had happened 
today. And there was something 
about the expression on Irv’s 
face . 

“Listen, Nick,” Irv said heavily 
at last. “I just want to ask you 
one question.” 

“What’s that, Irv?” Crandall 
kept himself rock-steady. 

“How long have you known? 
When did you find out?” 

Crandall ran through several 
possible answers in his mind, fi- 
nally selecting one. “A long time 
now, Irv. I just wasn’t in a posi- 
tion to do anything about it.” 
Irv nodded. “That’s what I 
thought. Well, listen, I’m not go- 
ing to plead with you. I know 
that after seven years of what 
you’ve gone through, pleading 
isn’t going to do me any good. 

30 



But, believe me or not, I didn’t 
start dipping into the till very 
much until my wife got sick. My 
personal funds were exhausted. 
I couldn’t borrow any more, and 
you were too busy with your own 
domestic troubles to be bothered. 
Then, when business started to 
get better, I wanted to prevent 
a sudden large discrepancy on 
the books. 

“So I continued milking the 
business, not for hospital ex- 
penses any more and not to de- 
ceive you, Nick — really! — but 
just so you wouldn’t find out how 
much I’d taken from it before. 
When you came to me and said 
you were completely discouraged 
and wanted out — well, there I’ll 
admit I was a louse. I should 
have told you. But after all, we 
hadn’t been doing too well as 
partners and I saw a chance to 
get the whole business in my 
name and on its feet, so I — I — ” 

“So you bought me out for 
three hundred and twenty cred- 
its,” Crandall finished for him. 
“How much is the firm worth 
now, Irv?” 

The other man averted his 
eyes. “Close to a million. But 
listen, Nick, business has been 
terrific this past year in the 
wholesale line. I didn’t cheat you 
out of all that! Listen, Nick — ” 

Crandall blew a snort of grim 
amusement through his nostrils. 
“What is it, Irv?” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I RV drew out a clean tissue and 
wiped his forehead. “Nick,” 
he said, leaning forward and try- 
ing hard to smile winningly. 
“Listen to me, Nick! You forget 
about it, you stop hunting me 
down, and I’ve got a proposition 
for you. I need a man with your 
technical know-how in top man- 
agement. I’ll give you a twenty 
per cent interest in the business, 
Nick — no, make it twenty-five 
per cent. Look, I’ll go as high as 
thirty per cent — thirty-five per 
cent — ” 

“Do you think that would make 
up for those seven years?” 

Irv waved trembling, concilia- 
tory hands. “No, of course not, 
Nick. Nothing would. But listen, 
Nick. I’ll make it forty-five 
per — ” 

Crandall shut him off. He sat 
for a while, then got up and 
walked around the room. He 
stopped and examined his blast- 
ers, the one he’d purchased ear- 
lier and the one he’d gotten from 
Dan. He took out his prison dis- 
charge and read it through care- 
fully. Then he shoved it back 
into the tunic pocket. 

He notified the switchboard 
that he wanted a long-distance 
Earthside call put through. 

“Yes, sir. But there’s a gentle- 
man to see you, sir. A Mr. Otto 
Henck.” 

“Send him up. And put the 
call in on my screen as soon as 



it goes through, please, Miss.” 
A few moments later, Blotto 
Otto entered his room. He was 
drunk, but carried it, as he al- 
ways did, remarkably well. 

“What do you think, Nick? 
What the hell do you — ” 

“Sh-h-h,” Crandall warned him. 
“My call’s coming in.” 

The Tibetan operator said, 
“Go ahead, New York,” and 
Frederick Stoddard Stephanson 
appeared on the screen. The man 
had aged more than any of the 
others Crandall had seen tonight. 
Although you never could tell 
with Stephanson: he always 

looked older when he was work- 
ing out a complex deal. 

S TEPHANSON didn’t say any- 
thing; he merely pursed his 
lips at Crandall and waited. Be- 
hind him and around him was a 
TV Spectacular’s idea of a hunt- 
ing lodge. 

“All right, Freddy,” Crandall 
said. “What I have to say won’t 
take long. You might as well call 
off your dogs and stop taking 
chances trying to kill and/or in- 
jure me. As of this moment, I 
don’t even have a grudge against 
you.” 

“You don’t even have a 
grudge — ” Stephanson gasped, in 
spite of his rigid self-control. 
“Why not?” 

“Because — oh, because a lot 
of things. Because killing you 



TIME IN ADVANCE 



31 



just wouldn’t be seven hellish 
years of satisfaction, now that 
I’m face-to-face with it. And be- 
cause you didn’t do any more to 
me than practically everybody 
else has done — from the cradle, 
for all I know. Because I’ve de- 
cided I’m a natural born sucker: 
that’s just the way I’m con- 
structed. All you did was take 
your kind of advantage of my 
kind of construction.” 

Stephanson leaned forward, 
peered intently, then relaxed and 
crossed his arms. “You’re actually 
telling the truth!” 

“Of course I’m telling the 
truth! You see these?” He held 
up the two blasters. “I’m getting 
rid of these tonight. From now 
on, I’ll be unarmed. I don’t want 
to have the least thing to do with 
weighing human life in the bal- 
ance.” 

The other man ran an index 
nail under a thumb nail thought- 
fully a couple of times. “I’ll tell 
you what,” he said. “If you mean 
what you say — and I think you 
do — maybe we can work out 
something. An arrangement, say, 
to repay you a bit for what you 
went through out there. I’d like 
to, but it’s really up to you wheth- 
er I can. We’ll see.” 

“When you don’t have to?” 
Crandall was astonished. “But 
why didn’t you make me an of- 
fer before this?” 

“Because you’d have thought 



I was trying to buy you off. 
I’d protect myself, yes, but I 
wouldn’t bribe you to spare my 
life.” 

Crandall considered the point. 
“I don’t get it. But maybe that’s 
the way you’re constructed. Well, 
we’ll see, as you said.” 

When he rose to face Henck, 
the little man was still shaking 
his head slowly, dazedly, intent 
only on his own problem. “What 
do you think, Nick? Elsa went 
on a sightseeing jaunt to the 
Moon last month. The line to 
her oxygen helmet got clogged, 
see, and she died of suffocation 
before they could do anything 
about it. Isn’t that a hell of 
thing, Nick? One month before 
I finish my sentence — she 
couldn’t wait one lousy little 
month! I bet she died laughing 
at me!” 

/"^RANDALL put his arm 
^ around him. “Let’s go out 
for a walk, Blotto Otto. We both 
need the exercise.” 

Funny how the capacity for 
murder affected people, he 
thought. There was Polly’s way 
— and Dan’s. There was old Irv 
bargaining frantically but still 
shrewdly for his life. Mr. Edward 
Ballaskia — and that girl in the 
restaurant. And there was Freddy 
Stephanson, the only intended 
victim — and the only one who 
wouldn’t beg. 



32 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He wouldn’t beg, but he might 
be willing to hand out largesse. 
Could Crandall accept what 
amounted to charity from Ste- 
phanson? He shrugged. Who 
knew what he or anyone else 
could or could not do? 

“What do we do now, Nick?” 
Blotto Otto was demanding pet- 
ulantly once they got outside 
the hotel. “That’s what I want to 
know — what do we do?” 

“Well, I’m going to do this,” 
Crandall told him, taking a 
blaster in each hand. “Just this.” 
He threw the gleaming weapons, 
right hand, left hand, at the 
transparent window walls that 
ran around the luxurious lobby 
of the Ritz-Capricorn. They 
struck thunk and then thunk 



again. The windows crashed 
down in long, pointed daggers. 
The people in the lobby swung 
around with their mouths open. 

A policeman ran up, his badge 
jingling against his metallic uni- 
form. He seized Crandall. 

“I saw you! I saw you do that! 
You’ll get thirty days for it!” 
“Hm,” said Crandall. “Thirty 
days?” He pulled his prison dis- 
charge out of his pocket and 
handed it to the policeman. “I 
tell you what we’ll do, officer — 
Just punch the proper number 
of holes in this document or tear 
off what seems to you a propor- 
tionately sized coupon. Either or 
both. Handle ,it any way you 
like.”

Then he went back to the

had pinned his knight and he 
didn’t like it. 

“Thirteen hours late!” the gen- 
eral fumed. 

“They may not have got it 
straight, sir.” 

“We spelled it out to them. We 
took them by the hand and we 
went over it time and time again 
so they’d have it clear in mind. 
They couldn’t possibly misunder- 
stand.” 

But they very possibly could, 
he knew. 

The Fivers misunderstood al- 
most everything. They had been 
confused about the armistice — 
as if they’d never heard of an 
armistice before. They had been 
obtuse about the prisoner ex- 
change. Even the matter of set- 
ting a simple time had involved 
excruciating explanation — as if 
they had never heard of the 
measurement of time and were 
completely innocent of basic 
mathematics. 

“Or maybe they broke down,” 
the captain offered. 

The general snorted. “They 
don’t break down. Those ships of 
theirs are marvels. They’d live 
through anything. They whipped 
us, didn’t they?” 

“Yes, sir,” said the captain. 

“How many of them, Captain, 
do you estimate we destroyed?” 

“Not more than a dozen, sir.” 

“They’re tough,” the general 
said.

TTE WENT back across the 
tent and sat down in a 

chair. 

The captain had been wrong. 
The right number was eleven. 
And of those, only one had been 
confirmed destroyed. The others 
had been no better than put out 
of action. 

And the way it figured out, 
the margin had been more than 
ten to one in favor of the Fivers. 
Earth, the general admitted to 
himself, had never taken such a 
beating. Whole squadrons had 
been wiped out; others had come 
fleeing back to Base with their 
numbers cut in half. 

They came fleeing back to 
Base and there were no cripples. 
They had returned without a 
scratch upon them. And the ships 
that had been lost had not been 
visibly destroyed — they had 
simply been wiped out, leaving 
not a molecule of wreckage. 

How do you beat a thing like 
that, he asked himself. How do 
you fight a weapon that cancels 
out a ship in its entirety? 

Back on Earth and on hun- 
dreds of other planets in the 
Galactic Confederacy, thousands 
of researchers were working day 
and night in a crash-priority pro- 
gram to find an answer to the 
weapon — or at least to find the 
weapon. 

But the chance of success ran 
thin, the general knew, for there

was not a single clue to the na- 
ture of it. Which was understand- 
able, since every victim of the 
weapon had been lost irretriev- 
ably. 

Perhaps some of the human 
prisoners would be able to pro- 
vide a clue. If there had been no 
such hope, he knew, Earth never 
would have gone to all the trou- 
ble to make this prisoner ex- 
change. 

He watched the captain and 
the sergeant hunched above the 
chessboard, with the captive 
Fiver looking on. 

He called the captive over. 

The captive came, like a trun- 
dling roly-poly. 

And once again, watching him, 
the general had that strange, dis- 
turbing sense of outrage. 

For the Fiver was a droll gro- 
tesque that held no hint of the 
martial spirit. He was round and 
jolly in every feature, expression 
and gesture, dressed in a ribald 
clash of colors, as though de- 
signed and clad deliberately to 
offend any military man. 

“Your friends are late,” the 
general told him. 

“You wait,” the Fiver said and 
his words were more like whis- 
tling than talk. One had to listen 
closely to make out what he 
said. 

The general held himself in 
check. 

No use in arguing. 



No point blowing up. 

He wondered if he — or the hu- 
man race — would ever under- 
stand the Fivers. 

Not that anyone really wanted 
to, of course. Just to get them 
combed out of Earth’s hair would 
be enough. 

“You wait,” the Fiver whistled. 
“They come in middle time from 
now.” 

And when in hell, the general 
wondered, would be a middle 
time from now? 

The Fiver glided back to watch 
the game. 

The general walked outside. 

r I 'HE tiny planet looked colder 
and more desolate and forbid- 
ding than it ever had before. 
Each time he looked at it, the 
general thought, the scene was 
more depressing than he had re- 
membered it. 

Lifeless, worthless, of no stra- 
tegic or economic value, it had 
qualified quite admirably as neu- 
tral territory to carry out the 
prisoner exchange. Neutral most- 
ly because it wasn’t worth the 
trouble for anyone to grab it. 

The distant star that was its 
sun was a dim glow in the sky. 
The black and naked rock crept 
out to a near horizon. The icy air 
was like a knife inside the gen- 
eral’s nostrils. 

There were no hills or valleys. 
There was absolutely nothing — 



HONORABLE OPPONENT 



37 



just the smooth flatness of the 
rock stretching on all sides, for 
all the world like a great space- 
field. 

It had been the Fivers, the 
general remembered, who had 
suggested this particular planet 
and that in itself was enough to 
make it suspect. But Earth, at 
that point in the negotiations, 
had been in no position to do 
much haggling. 

He stood with his shoulders 
hunched and he felt the cold 
breath of apprehension blowing 
down his neck. With each passing 
hour, it seemed, the place felt 
more and more like some gigan- 
tic trap. 

But he must be wrong, he ar- 
gued. There was absolutely noth- 
ing in the Fivers’ attitude to 
make him feel like that. They 
had, in fact, been almost mag- 
nanimous. They could have laid 
down their terms — almost any 
terms — and the Confederacy 
would have had no choice but to 
acquiesce. For Earth must buy 
time, no matter what the price. 
Earth had to be ready next time 
— five years or ten or whatever 
it might be. 

But the Fivers had made no 
demands, which was unthinkable. 

Except, the general told him- 
self, one could never know what 
they might be thinking or what 
they might be planning. 

The exchange camp huddled in 



the dimness — a few tents, a port- 
able power plant, the poised and 
waiting ship and, beside it, the 
little scouter the captive Fiver 
had been piloting. 

The scouter iri itself was a 
good example of the gulf which 
separated the Fivers and the hu- 
mans. It had taken three full 
days of bickering before the Fi- 
vers had been able to make clear 
their point that the scouter as 
well as its pilot must be returned 
to them. 

No ship in all the Galaxy had 
ever gotten so thorough a study 
as that tiny craft. But the facts 
that it had yielded had been few 
indeed. And the captive Fiver, 
despite the best efforts of the 
experts in Psych, had furnished 
even fewer. 

The area was quiet and almost 
deserted. Two sentries strode 
briskly up and down. Everyone 
else was under cover, killing 
time, waiting for the Fivers. 

The general walked quickly 
across the area to the medic tent. 
He stooped and went inside. 

TT^OUR men were sitting at a 
table, drearily playing cards. 
One of them put down his hand 
and rose. 

“Any word, General?” 

The general shook his head. 
“They should be coming soon, 
Doc. Everything all set?” 

“We’ve been ready for some 



38 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



time,” said the psychiatrist. “We’ll 
bring the boys in here and check 
them over as soon as they arrive. 
We’ve got the stuff all set. It 
won’t take us long.” 

“That’s fine. I want to get off 
this rock as quickly as I can. I 
don’t like the feel of it.” 

“There’s just one thing . .” 
“What’s that?” 

“If we only knew how many 
they are handing back?” 

The general shook his head. 
“We never could find out. They’re 
not so hot on figures. And you’d 
think, wouldn’t you, that math 
would be universal?” 

“Well,” said Doc resignedly, 
“we’ll do the best we can.” 

“There can’t be many,” the 
general said. ‘We’re only giving 
back one Fiver and one ship. 
How many humans do you fig- 
ure a ship is worth to them?” 

“I wouldn’t know. You really 
think they’ll come?” 

“It’s hard to be certain that 
they understood. When it comes 
to sheer stupidity — ” 

“Not so stupid,” Doc replied, 
quietly. ‘We couldn’t learn their 
language, so they learned ours.” 
“I know,” the general said im- 
patiently. “I realize all that. But 
that armistice business — it took 
days for them to get what we 
were driving at. And the time 
reckoning system still more days. 
Good Lord, man, you could do 
better using sign language with 

HONORABLE OPPONENT 



a Stone Age savage!” 

“You should,” said Doc. “The 
savage would be human.” 

“But these Fivers are intelli- 
gent. Their technology, in many 
ways, has us beaten seven ways 
from Sunday. They fought us to 
a standstill.” 

“They licked us.” 

“All right, then, they licked us. 
And why not? They had this 
weapon that we didn’t have. 
They were closer to their bases. 
They had no logistics problem 
to compare with ours. They 
licked us, but I ask you, did they 
have the sense to know it? Did 
they take advantage of it? They 
could have wiped us out. They 
could have laid down peace terms 
that would have crippled us for 
centuries. Instead, they let us go. 
Now how does that make sense?” 
“You’re dealing with an alien 
race,” said Doc. 

“We’ve dealt with other aliens. 
And we always understood them. 
Mostly, we got along with them.” 
“We dealt with them on a 
commercial basis,” Doc reminded 
him. “Whatever trouble we might 
have had with them came after 
a basic minimum of understand- 
ing had been achieved. The Fi- 
vers are the first that ever came 
out shooting.” 

CAN’T figure it,” the gen- 
eral said. “We weren’t even 
heading for them. We might have 

39 



passed them by. They couldn’t 
have known who we were. Point 
is, they didn’t care. They just 
came piling out and opened up 
on us. And it’s been the same 
with everyone else who came 
within their reach. They take on 
every comer. There’s never a 
time when they aren’t fighting 
someone — sometimes two or 
three at once.” 

“They have a defensive com- 
plex,” said Doc. “Want to be left 
alone. All they aim to do is keep 
others off their planets. As you 
say, they could have wiped us 
out.” 

“Maybe they get hurt real 
easy. Don’t forget we gave them 
a bloody nose or two — not as 
much as they busted us, but we 
hurt them some. I figure they’ll 
come out again, soon as they can 
cut in.” 

He drew a deep breath. “Next 
time, we have to be ready for 
them. Next time, they may not 
stop. We have to dope them out.” 

It was tough work, he thought, 
to fight an enemy about which 
one knew next to nothing. And 
a weapon about which one knew 
absolutely nothing. 

There were theories in plenty, 
but the best no more than edu- 
cated guesses. 

The weapon might operate in 
time — hurling its targets back 
into unimagined chaos. Or it 
might be dimensional. Or it might 

40 



collapse the atoms in upon them- 
selves, reducing a spaceship to 
the most deadly massive dust- 
mote the Universe had known. 

One thing for certain — it was 
not disintegration, for there was 
no flash and there was no heat. 
The ship just disappeared and 
that was the end of it — the end 
and all of it. 

“There’s another thing that 
bothers me,” said Doc. “Those 
other races that fought the Fivers 
before they jumped on us. When 
we tried to contact them, when 
we tried to get some help from 
them, they wouldn’t bother with 
us. They wouldn’t tell us any- 
thing.” 

“This is a new sector of space 
for us,” the general said. “We 
are strangers here.” 

“It stands to reason,” argued 
Doc, “they should jump at the 
chance to gang up on the Fivers.” 

“We can’t depend on alliances. 
We stand alone. It is up to us.” 

He bent to leave the tent. 

“We’ll get right on it,” said 
Doc, “soon as the men show up. 
We’ll have a preliminary report 
within an hour, if they’re in any 
shape at all.” 

“That’s fine,” the general said 
and ducked out of the tent. 

It was a bad situation, blind 
and terrifying if one didn’t man- 
age to keep a good grip on him- 
self. 

The captive humans might 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



bring back some information, but 
even so, you couldn’t buy it 
blind, for there might be a gim- 
mick in it — as there was a gim- 
mick in what the captive Fiver 
knew. 

r 1 1 HIS time, he told himself, 
the psych boys might have 
managed to outsmart themselves. 

It had been a clever trick, all 
right — taking the captive Fiver 
on that trip and showing him so 
proudly all the barren, no-good 
planets, pretending they were 
the showplaces of the Confed- 
eracy. 

Clever — if the Fiver had been 
human. For no human would 
have fought a skirmish, let alone 
a war, for the kind of planets 
he’d been shown. 

But the Fiver wasn’t human. 
And there was no way of know- 
ing what kind of planet a Fiver 
might take a fancy to. 

And there always was the 
chance that those crummy plan- 
ets had given him the hunch 
that Earth would be easy prey. 

The whole situation didn’t 
track, the general thought. There 
was a basic wrongness to it. Even 
allowing for all the differences 
which might exist between the 
Fiver and the human cultures, 
the wrongness still persisted. 

And there was something 
wrong right here. 

He heard the sound and 



wheeled to stare into the sky. 

The ship was close and com- 
ing in too fast. 

But even as he held his breath, 
it slowed and steadied and came 
to ground in a perfect landing 
not more than a quarter of a 
mile from where the Earth ship 
stood. 

The general broke into a run 
toward it, then remembered and 
slowed to a stiff military walk. 

Men were tumbling out of 
tents and forming into lines. An 
order rang across the area and 
the lines moved with perfect 
drill precision. 

The general allowed himself 
a smile. Those boys of his were 
good. You never caught them 
napping. If the Fivers had ex- 
pected to sneak in and catch the 
camp confused and thus gain a 
bit of face, it was a horse on 
them. 

The marching men swung 
briskly down the field. An am- 
bulance moved out from beneath 
its tarp and followed. The drums 
began to roll and the bugles 
sounded clear and crisp in the 
harsh, cold air. 

It was men like these, the gen- 
eral told himself with pride, who 
held the expanding Confederacy 
intact. It was men like these who 
kept the peace across many cubic 
light-years. It was men like these 
who some day, God willing, 
would roll back the Fiver threat. 



HONORABLE OPPONENT 



41 



There were few wars now. 
Space was too big for it. There 
were too many ways to skirt 
around the edge of war for it to 
come but seldom. But something 
like the Fiver threat could not 
be ignored. Some day, soon or 
late, either Earth or Fiver must 
go down to complete defeat. The 
Confederacy could never feel se- 
cure with the Fivers on its flank. 

F EET pounded behind him and 
the general turned. It was 
Captain Gist, buttoning his tunic 
as he ran. He fell in beside the 
general. 

“So they finally came, sir.” 
“Fourteen hours late,” the gen- 
eral said. “Let us, for the mo- 
ment, try to look our best. You 
missed a button, Captain.” 

“Sorry, sir,” the captain said, 
fastening the button. 

“Right, then. Get those shoul- 
ders back. Smartly, if you will. 
Right, left, hup, hup!” 

Out of the corner of his eye, 
he saw that Sergeant Conrad had 
his squad moving out with pre- 
cision, escorting the captive Fi- 
ver most correctly forward, with 
all the dignity and smartness that 
anyone might wish. 

The men were drawn up now 
in two parallel lines, flanking the 
ship. The port was swinging open 
and the ramp was rumbling out 
and the general noted with some 
satisfaction that he and Captain 

42 



Gist would arrive at the foot of 
the ramp about the time it 
touched the ground. The timing 
was dramatic and superb, almost 
as if he himself had planned it 
down to the last detail. 

The ramp snapped into posi- 
tion and three Fivers came se- 
dately waddling down it. 

A seedy-looking trio, the gen- 
eral thought. Not a proper uni- 
form nor a medal among the lot 
of them. 

The general seized the diplo- 
matic initiative as soon as they 
reached the ground. 

“We welcome you,” he told 
them, speaking loudly and slowly 
and as distinctly as he could so 
they would understand. 

They lined up and stood look- 
ing at him and he felt a bit un- 
comfortable because there was 
that round jolly expression in 
their faces. Evidently they didn’t 
have the kind of faces that could 
assume any other expression. But 
they kept on looking at him. 

The general plunged ahead. “It 
is a matter of great gratification 
to Earth to carry out in good 
faith our obligations as agreed 
upon in the armistice proceed- 
ings. It marks what we sincerely 
hope will be the beginning of an 
era . .” 

“Most nice,” one of the Fivers 
said. Whether he meant the gen- 
eral’s little speech or the entire 
situation or was simply trying to 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



be gracious was not at once ap- 
parent. 

U ndaunted, the general 

was ready to go on, but the 
spokesman Fiver raised a short 
round arm to halt him. 

“Prisoners arrive briefly,” he 
whistled. 

“You mean you didn’t bring 
them?” 

“They come again,” the Fiver 
said with a glorious disregard for 
preciseness of expression. 

He continued beaming at the 
general and he made a motion 
with the arm that might have 
been a shrug. 

“Shennanigans,” the captain 
said, close to the general’s ear. 
“We talk,” Jhe Fiver said. 
“They’re up to something,” 
warned the captain. “It calls for 
Situation Red, sir.” 

“I agree,” the general told the 
captain. “Set it up quietly.” He 
said to the Fiver delegation: “If 
you gentlemen will come with 
me, I can offer you refreshments.” 
He had a feeling that they 
were smiling at him, mocking 
him, but one could never tell. 
Those jolly expressions were al- 
ways the same. No matter what 
the situation. 

“Most happy,” said the Fiver 
spokesman. “These refresh — ” 
“Drink,” the general said and 
made a motion to supplement 
the word. 



“Drink is good,” the Fiver an- 
swered. “Drink is friend?” 

“That is right,” the general 
said. 

He started for the tent, walk- 
ing slowly so the Fivers could 
keep up. 

He noted with some satisfac- 
tion that the captain had carried 
on most rapidly, indeed. Corpo- 
ral Conrad was marching his 
squad back across the area, with 
the captive Fiver shambling in 
the center. The tarps were coming 
off the guns and the last of the 
crew was clambering up the lad- 
der of the ship. 

The captain caught up with 
them just short of the tent. 

“Everything all set, sir,” Cor- 
poral Conrad reported in a whis- 
per. 

“Fine,” the general said. 

They reached the tent and 
went inside. The general opened 
a refrigerating unit and took out 
a gallon jug. 

“This,” he explained, “is a 
drink we made for your compa- 
triot. He found it very tasty.” 

He set out glasses and sipping 
straws and uncorked the jug, 
wishing he could somehow hold 
his nose, for the drink smelled 
like something that had been 
dead too long. He didn’t even like 
to guess what might have gone 
into it. The chemists back on 
Earth had whomped it up for 
the captive Fiver, who had con- 



HONORABLE OPPONENT 



43 



sumed gallon after gallon of it 
with disconcerting gusto. 

The general filled the glasses 
and the Fivers picked them up 
in their tentacles and stuck the 
straws into their drawstring 
mouths. They drank and rolled 
their eyes in appreciation. 

The general took the glass of 
liquor the captain handed him 
and gulped half of it in haste. The 
tent was getting just a little thick. 
What things a man goes through, 
he thought, to serve his planets 
and his peoples. 

TTE WATCHED the Fivers 
drinking and wondered 
what they might have up their 
sleeves. 

Talk, the spokesman had told 
him, and that might mean almost 
anything. It might mean a re- 
opening of negotiations or it 
might be nothing but a stall. 

And if it was a negotiation, 
Earth was across the barrel. For 
there was nothing he could do 
but negotiate. Earth’s fleet was 
crippled and the Fivers had the 
weapon and a renewal of the 
war was unthinkable. Earth 
needed five years at the minimum 
and ten years would be still 
better. 

And if it was attack, if this 
planet was a trap, there was only 
one thing he could do — stand 
and fight as best he could, a thor- 
oughly suicidal course. 

44 



Either way, Earth lost, the 
general realized. 

The Fivers put down their 
glasses and he filled them up 
again. 

“You do well,” one of the Fi- 
vers said. “You got the paper 
and the marker?” 

“Marker?” the general asked. 

“He means a pencil,” said the 
captain. 

“Oh, yes. Right here.” The 
general reached for a pad of pa- 
per and a pencil and laid them 
on the desk. 

One of the Fivers set down his 
glass and, picking up the pencil, 
started to make a laborious 
drawing. He looked for all the 
world like a five-year-old print- 
ing his first alphabet. 

They waited while the Fiver 
drew. Finally he was finished. He 
laid the pencil down and pointed 
to the wiggly lines. 

“Us,” he said. 

He pointed to the sawtooth 
lines. 

“You,” he told the general. 

The general bent above the 
paper, trying to make out what 
the Fiver had put down. 

“Sir,” the captain said, “it looks 
like a battle diagram.” 

“Is,” said the Fiver proudly. 

He picked the pencil up. 

“Look,” he said. 

He drew directional lines and 
made a funny kind of symbol for 
the points of contact and made 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



crosses for the sections where 
the battle lines were broken. 
When he was done, the Earth 
fleet had been shattered and 
sliced into three segments and 
was in headlong flight. 

“That,” the general said, with 
the husk of anger rising in his 
throat, “was the engagement in 
Sector 17. Half of our Fifth 
Squadron was wiped out that 
day.” 

“Small error,” said the Fiver 
and made a deprecatory gesture. 

He ripped the sheet of paper 
off the pad and tossed it on the 
floor. He laboriously drew the 
diagram again. 

“Attend,” he said. 

T HE Fiver drew the direction- 
al lines again, but this time 
he changed them slightly. Now 
the Earth line pivoted and broke 
and became two parallel lines 
that flanked the Fiver drive and 
turned and blunted it and scat- 
tered it in space. 

The Fiver laid the pencil 
down. 

“Small matter,” he informed 
the general and the captain. 
“You good. You make one thin 
mistake.” 

Holding himself sternly in 
hand, the general filled the 
glasses once again. 

What are they getting at, he 
thought. Why don’t they come 
flat out and say it? 



“So best,” one of the Fivers 
said, lifting his glass to let them 
know that he meant the drink. 

“More?” asked the Fiver tac- 
tician, picking up the pencil. 

“Please,” said the general, 
seething. 

He walked to the tent flap 
and looked outside. The men 
were at the guns. Thin wisps of 
vapor curled from the ship’s 
launching tubes; in just a little 
while, it would be set to go, 
should the need arise. The camp 
was quiet and tense. 

He went back to the desk and 
watched as the Fiver went on 
gaily with his lesson on how to 
win a battle. He filled page after 
page with diagrams and occa- 
sionally he was generous — he 
sometimes showed how the Fi- 
vers lost when they might have 
won with slightly different tac- 
tics. 

“Interesting!” he piped enthu- 
siastically. 

“I find it so,” the general said. 
“There is just one question.” 

“Ask,” the Fiver invited. 

“If we should go to war again, 
how can you be sure we won’t 
use all of this against you?” 

“But fine,” the Fiver enthused 
warmly. “Exactly as we want.” 

“You fight fine,” another Fiver 
said. “But just too slightly hard. 
Next time, you able to do much 
better.” 

“Hard!” the general raged. 



HONORABLE OPPONENT 



45 



“Too roughly, sir. No need to 
make the ship go poof.” 

Outside the tent, a gun cut 
loose and then another one and 
above the hammering of the 
guns came the full-throated, 
ground-shaking roar of many 
ship motors. 

The general leaped for the en- 
trance, went through it at a run, 
not bothering with the flap. His 
cap fell off and he staggered out, 
thrown slightly off his balance. 
He jerked up his head and saw 
them coming in, squadron after 
squadron, painting the darkness 
with the flare of tubes. 

C?CTOP FIRING!” he shouted. 

^ “You crazy fools, stop 
firing!” 

But there was no need of 
shouting, for the guns had fallen 
silent. 

The ships came down toward 
the camp in perfect flight forma- 
tion. They swept across it and 
the thunder of their motors 
seemed to lift it for a moment 
and give it a mighty shake. Then 
they were climbing, rank on ser- 
ried rank, still with drill preci- 
sion — climbing and jockeying 
into position for regulation land- 
ing. 

The general stood like a fro- 
zen man, with the wind ruffling 
his iron-gray hair, with a lump, 
half pride, half thankfulness, ris- 
ing in his throat. 

46 



Something touched his elbow. 
“Prisoners,” said the Fiver. “I 
told you bye and bye.” 

The general tried to speak, but 
the lump was there to stop him. 
He swallowed it and tried once 
again. 

“We didn’t understand,” he 
said. 

“You did not have a taker,” 
said the Fiver. “That why you 
fight so rough.” 

“We couldn’t help it,” the gen- 
eral told him. “We didn’t know. 
We never fought this way be- 
fore.” 

“We give you takers,” said the 
Fiver. “Next time, we play it 
right. You do much better with 
the takers. It easier on us.” 

No wonder, the general thought, 
they didn’t know about an ar- 
mistice. No wonder they were 
confused about the negotiations 
and the prisoner exchange. Nego- 
tiations are not customarily 
needed to hand back the pieces 
one has won in a game. 

And no wonder those other 
races had viewed with scorn and 
loathing Earth’s proposal to gang 
up on the Fivers. 

“An unsporting thing to do,” 
the general said aloud. “They 
could have told us. Or maybe 
they were so used to it.” 

And now he understood why 
the Fivers had picked this planet. 
There had to be a place where 
all the ships could land. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



H E STOOD and watched the 
landing ships mushing 
down upon the rock in clouds of 
pinkish flame. He tried to count 
them, but he became confused, 
although he knew every ship 
Earth had lost would be ac- 
counted for. 

“We give you takers,” said the 
Fiver. “We teach you how to use. 
They easy operate. They never 
hurt people or ships.” 

And there was more to it, the 
general told himself, than just a 
silly game — though maybe not 
so silly, once one understood the 
history and the cultural back- 
ground and the philosophic con- 
cepts that were tied into it. And 
this much one could say for it: 
It was better than fighting actual 
wars. 

But with the takers, there 
would be an end of war. What 
little war was left would be ended 
once for all. No longer would an 
enemy need to be defeated; he 



could be be simply taken. No 
longer would there be years of 
guerrilla fighting on newly set- 
tled planets; the aborigines could 
be picked up and deposited in 
cultural reservations and the 
dangerous fauna shunted into 
zoos. 

“We fight again?” the Fiver 
asked with some anxiety. 

“Certainly,” said the general. 
“Any time you say. Are we really 
as good as you claim?” 

“You not so hot,” the Fiver ad- 
mitted with disarming candor. 
“But you the best we ever find. 
Play plenty, you get better.” 
The general grinned. Just like 
the sergeant and the captain and 
their eternal chess, he thought. 

He turned and tapped the Fi- 
ver on the shoulder. 

“Let’s get back,” he said. 
“There’s still some drinking in 
that jug. We mustn’t let it go to 
waste.”

were both in the car, whirling 
violently back from the grinding 
clash of a collision. The other 
car receded; its headlamps final- 
ly turned to a dim glow on the 
far side of the hill and vanished. 
The road reeled back silently, 
smoothly. 

Sullivan watched the stars 
wheel through the night as he 
drove. 

He was tired and at peace,

wanting nothing, accepting every- 
thing with a quiet wonder. 

How strange and wonderful 
it all was, entering his home for 
the first time — five beautifully 
furnished rooms, just right for 
Emily and himself. The books 
with their leather and cloth bind- 
ings! The pictures, the boxes of 
cigars, the wardrobes and dressers 
full of rich, dark clothing cut to 
his measure! Life, thought Laur- 
ence Wallace Sullivan, was good. 

That morning before the fire, 
his hand took a comfortably worn 
leather volume from the shelves 
and opened it to a thumb-marked 
page. 

Time’s graven footsteps 
in the sands 

Behind us, if we but 
approach, 

Sublime our own lives 
we can make. 

Remind us, lives of all 
great men! 

Wonderful words . He 
glanced at his watch. The sky 
outside his study window was 
lightening from deep azure to 
robin’s egg, faintly green over the 
skeletal forest of antennas. He 
felt stuffed; it was time for din- 
ner. 

He replaced the book on 
its shelf and strolled into the 
dining room, sighing and stretch- 
ing. 

THIS WAY TO THE REGRESS 



HE FIRM of Sullivan and 
Gaynor, he found, operated 
an unprinting plant that filled a 
three-story building on Vesey 
Street. The enormous machines 
devoured every kind of printed 
matter and turned it into neat 
rolls of paper, cans of ink, metal 
ingots. Their operation was far too 
complex for Sullivan to under- 
stand fully and he did not try, 
contenting himself with the cor- 
respondence and the financial re- 
ports that flowed across his desk. 
Gaynor, his partner, spent more 
time in the plant — a red-faced, 
dyspeptic man with a raucous 
voice. 

Nevertheless, Sullivan flattered 
himself that he understood the 
romance of his business: Words, 
words from all over the world 
streamed into this building in 
nature’s senseless profusion — 
words endlessly repeated, words 
plucked from dead fires and from 
trashcans, to be carefully un- 
printed and reduced to one copy 
only of each sermon, pamphlet, 
book, advertising leaflet. Like 
arrow-shapes, fan-shapes of float- 
ing paper, each found its way un- 
erringly to the one man for whom 
it was meant. Sullivan (in his 
humble way, of course) was a 
public servant, a guardian of re- 
gress. 

The swift years went by. Sum- 
mers, on Cape Cod, Sullivan be- 
gan to feel a strange discontent,

listening to the curlews piping 
on the sands, or watching a sud- 
den evening squall carry water 
in gray pencil-marks up from the 
sea. In his lips, each pale Havana 
cigar prolonged itself behind its 
inch-long ash, until at last it 
rounded itself off, and he drew 
the flame, capped the cigar with 
his silver knife, and put it away 
carefully in the humidor. 

Emily’s hair was darkening; 
they talked more now, and quar- 
reled more. Sometimes she looked 
strangely at him. Where was it 
all heading? What was life for? 

He was fifty-two when he dis- 
covered sex with Emily — a brief 
and unsatisfactory experience, not 
soon repeated. Two years later, 
he met Peggy. 

It was in an apartment house 
in the fifties, where he had never 
been before. The door opened as 
he turned to it one afternoon 
and she slapped his face, hard. 
Then they were inside, glaring 
at each other, breathing heavily. 
Sullivan felt a fury for her that 
was all mingled with disgust and 
satiated desire. 

A FTER PEGGY came Alice, 
and after Alice there was 
Connie. That was in 1942; Sulli- 
van was forty-seven, in the prime 
of his vigor. 

In that year, the stranger who 
was his son came home from 
Italy. Robert had just been dis- 

THIS WAY TO THE REGRESS 



charged from the Army; he 
called himself R. Gaynor Sulli- 
van at first, was gawky and in- 
solent, but after he enrolled in 
college, things went better. Then, 
in a surprisingly short time, he 
was home again and the apart- 
ment was not big enough. 

They moved to a house in 
Long Island City — more con- 
fusion, and Sullivan’s relations 
with his wife were strained. He 
was working too hard; the firm’s 
business was booming, due partly 
to a heavy lump-sum repayment 
to Emily’s father. 

Each month, the check stubs. 
Money poured into the account 
from grocer, dentist, doctors . 
he was always hard pressed to 
pay enough other people to keep 
it stabilized. 

In the evenings, his familiar 
face stared back at him from the 
mirror, haggard and gray. His 
fingers rubbed the smooth cheek; 
the razor came riding diagonally 
up with a crisp sound, trailing 
lather and making the bristles 
sprout behind it. Then the warm 
brush to remove the lather, and 
the same face, with its beard re- 
stored. What if he should leave 
it smooth some day? But he 
didn’t want to be conspicuous. 

The firm had moved several 
times, finally settling in a loft on 
Bleeker Street. Their operations 
had simplified; more and more 
employees had left, until Sullivan, 

51 



Gaynor and three unprinters were 
running the place themselves. 

Sullivan often took a hand at 
the job press; once you had 
learned the trick of it, there was 
a soothing, almost hypnotic qual- 
ity in the rhythm that flicked a 
blank page from the platen and 
slapped a printed on in to be 
erased, all in the acrobatic mo- 
ment of safety when the metal 
jaws gaped. 

Gaynor was a much more 
likable fellow these days; Sulli- 
van’s days at work were filled 
with pleasure, as his nights were 
at home. The boy had grown in- 
credibly dear to him and he was 
in love with Emily. He had never, 
Sullivan thought, been so happy. 

r T , HE LAST vouchers had been 
filled, the final entries had 
been erased from the ledgers, 
the workmen were unbolting the 
presses and dismantling them to 
be carried away. There was 
nothing more to do but to shake 
hands on it and go their separate 
ways. He and Gaynor ceremoni- 
ally locked the door together and 
adjourned to the bar downstairs, 
feeling a premonitory glow. 

“Here’s to success!” 

“Maybe now that this fella 
Roosevelt is going out, we’ll see 
some changes.” 

They clinked their glasses 
solemnly, set them down on the 
waitress’s tray and, sobered, left. 

52 



Gaynor was going back to Min- 
neapolis, where he had a job as 
foreman of an unprinting plant. 
Sullivan himself was going to 
have to hunt for a while before 
he found a job as assistant to a 
paper broker. But not for long; 
the Boom was coming up in a few 
years. 

* * * 

Sullivan uncrumpled the Sun, 
relishing the heavy . feel of the 
gray pages. “That woman is out 
of office in Texas,” he announced, 
adding “Good riddance!” Yes, 
that was what the headline said. 
Women governors — what was 
the world coming to? 

Emily, unfolding diapers, did 
not seem to hear. She was losing 
her figure again; she seemed pale, 
tired and listless. Little Robert 
was grunting in his cradle; he 
had shrunk to a fat handful, more 
animal than baby. He slept near- 
ly all the time, when he was not 
howling or further distending 
Emily’s swollen breasts. 

Life was a queer business. In 
another month, it would be time 
to take them both to the hospital 
and only Emily would be coming 
home. That was funny; he had 
loved the child and he took an 
affectionate interest in it even 
now, but it would be almost a 
relief to get rid of it. Afterward, 
it would be a good six months 
before Emily got her figure back. 

She glanced at him sidelong. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



She was still a lovely woman, but 
what did she secretly think of 
him? What was it really all 
about? 

T HE MINISTER’S voice 
droned in his ears. Emily, 
looking more beautiful than he 
had ever seen her, gently moved 
out of his embrace. He took the 
ring from her finger and handed 
it to Bob. 

“I divorce thee with this ring,” 
he said. 

Later, they went out together, 
many times. At a party one morn- 
ing, a polite stranger led him up 
to her and said, “Emily, I want 
you to say good-by to Larry 
Sullivan.” They looked across a 
gulf; her fingers were cool in his 
and he knew he would never see 
her again. 

From that day on, there was 
an emptiness in his life. He tried 
to fill it with amusements — too 
much liquor, too much music. He 
met girls and kissed them, took 
them on dates, but he missed his 
wife. It was hard to get used to, 
living alone after all those years 
together. 

Still, life had its compensa- 
tions. There was an endless in- 
terest in watching the changes 
the years brought, seeing it all 
work out. 

Automobiles lost all trace of 
their former streamlines, became 
elegantly spare or even boxy, 

THIS WAY TO THE RECRESS 



hinting at the victorias and 
broughams to come. There were 
fewer machines on the streets 
and fewer people; the air was 
purer. Garbo replaced Grable on 
the silver screen. Abruptly, then, 
the movies ceased to talk. The 
incomparable Chaplin came into 
his own; the Keystone cops grew 
famous. 

Sullivan watched it all with 
fascinated eyes. Technological re- 
gress was certainly a wonderful 
thing! And yet sometimes Sulli- 
van found himself thinking nos- 
talgically of the old blaring, bus- 
tling days. 

Luckily, there was still the War 
to come. Europe was rousing from 
her long sleep and, to the east, 
holy Russia was being born. 

S ULLIVAN nervously fingered 
the scar on his chin. He was 
due to go to field hospital with 
it, he judged — it was tight and 
raw-feeling and itched. It was 
the worst scar he had, puckered 
and stretching halfway up his 
shin-bone; he would be glad to 
get rid of it and go on to the 
front. War was not much like 
the movies, so far. 

He walked out of the barracks 
tent into the sunlight, helping 
himself along with his cane. 
There were a lot of other casual- 
ties; he supposed this must be the 
prelude of the big battle of the 
Argonne that he had read about 

53 



in the prophecies. That would be 
where his number came up. What 
would it be — a mortar shell, or 
hand-to-hand — or even some- 
thing anticlimatic, like falling 
over a tent rope in the dark? 

He wished the time would 
come, so he could get it over 
with. 

* * * 

He met his father, briefly, 
when he came home from France. 
The old man was very gray and 
shaky, and they did not seem to 
have much in common. It was a 
relief on both sides when Sullivan 
went off to Cornell. 

He was enrolled as a senior, 
which meant he had to go the 
full four years. Sullivan did not 
mind that; the years you spent in 
college were the most important 
ones of your life. Here everything 
you had thought and read, all 
you knew, all you had been, 
poured out of you and funneled 
down to the instructee of that 
particular class. Then the in- 
structee would sum it all up in 
one of his lectures, dry or brilliant 
according to who it was, and 
eventually the essence of it 
would get into the ultimate copy 
of a textbook, to be absorbed by 
the author and so returned to 
nature, used up, got rid of. 

In the spring, Sullivan went 
out for football. He was registered 
in the athletic prediction books 
as playing two full seasons on 

54 



the ’varsity. The books did not 
say so, but probably that was 
where he was going to get rid 
of the crook in his nose. 

Professor Toohey was an old 
duck who took a fancy to Sulli- 
van before he had been in col- 
lege a year. They used to spout 
beer, down in Toohey’s dark 
cellar, where he kept a keg for 
it, and talk philosophy. “There’s 
something to think about,” Tooh- 
ey might begin, circling up to 
a subject they had discussed be- 
fore. “How can we tell? The re- 
verse sequence of causation may 
be just as valid as the one we 
are experiencing. Cause and ef- 
fect are arbitrary, after all.” 

“But it sounds pretty far- 
fetched,” Sullivan would say 
cautiously. 

“It’s hard for us to imagine, 
just because we’re not used to 
it. It’s only a matter of view- 
point. Water would run down- 
hill, and so on. Energy would flow 
the other way — from total con- 
centration to total dispersion. 
Why not?” 

VW^HEN Sullivan tried to visu- 
™ alize that peculiar world, it 
gave him a half-pleasant shud- 
der. Imagine never knowing the 
date of your death. “Everything 
would be backward. If you meant 
‘catch,’ you’d have have to say 
‘throw.’ All the words would have 
to mean different things — all 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the verbs that express duration, 
anyway. There are difficulties to 
it.” 

“It all makes perfectly good 
sense in its own terms,” stated 
Profesor Toohey. “Friction would 
be a factor to be subtracted from 
energy calculation, not added. 
And so on. The Universe would 
be expanding; we’d heat our 
houses with furnaces instead of 
cooling them. Grass would grow 
out of seeds. And there’d be no 
increting and exgesting as we 
do.” 

Sullivan grinned. “You mean 
the older we got, the more wrin- 
kled and decrepit we’d be?” 

“Think about it for a minute. 
It would seem perfectly natural. 
We might live backward, death 
to birth, and never know the 
difference. Which came first, the 
chicken or the egg? Do wars 
cause armies, or armies wars? 
What do we mean by causation, 
anyway? Think about it.” 

“Hmmm.” 

And the formal end-question: 
“Sullivan, what do you think 
about the principle of causation?” 

He wished he knew. 

* * * 

The world was growing larger 
and brighter, now that he was ten. 
Sullivan had a furious energy that 
drove him out of doors all day 
in good weather. Even in winter, 
he stood about, watching the 
freezing ground water rush up the 

THIS WAY TO THE REGRESS 



drainspout, or letting the snow 
form on his head and shoulders, 
drifting up into the white sky as 
it did from the ground on which 
he stood. 

Whatever came, he took with- 
out question. If his fingers and 
nose were bright pink with cold 
when he went out, the snow 
would warm them. If he awoke 
with a black eye, a friend would 
heal it with his fist. 

Sullivan climbed his friends’ 
backs and leaped off, and they 
his, with peals of cracked idiot 
laughter. They fidgeted in class, 
made comical faces at one 
another from behind books, 
swarmed yelling uphill and down 
again. For repletion, there was 
mealtime, and time was the cure 
for hunger. 

The hardest thing was that 
Mrs. Hastings would not let him 
out of bed when he awoke early 
in the morning, though any fool 
could see he was not going to 
sleep any more. After that, his 
day was one long gallop. 

r | ’’HERE CAME a day when 
Sullivan and his father were 
seized with a nervous anticipa- 
tion; it took the form of tears 
on Sullivan’s part, scowls and 
throat-clearings on his father’s. 
All day, they were good for 
nothing and could not look at 
each other. At last, in the late 
afternoon, they dressed to go out. 

55 



A hired carriage was waiting. 

His father drove, following the 
roads automatically. When they 
got out, Sullivan saw that they 
were in a cemetery. 

Something clutched tight at 
his heart. His father’s arm came 
unwelcome around him, the 
strong fingers hard on his arm 
as he stumbled. Others were 
moving nearby; finally they all 
grouped, and turned, and were 
standing beside a half-open grave. 
Two men were uncovering the 
box already, expertly catching 
each shovel-load of dirt as it 
leaped, thrusting it sharply into 
the pile and waiting for the next. 

Afterward, they raised the box 
with broad straps until it rested 
on boards laid across the hole in 
the ground. The minister, stand- 
ing on the far side of the grave, 
unfolded his hands and spoke. 

“. From dust thou comest, 
and dust thou art . .” 

When he was finished, he 
coughed apologetically and was 
silent. The crowd began to flow 
away. The workmen stood be- 
side the grave and the box, bare- 
headed in the sunlight, hands at 
their sides. 

* * * 

Sullivan was trying to get 
used to an unaccustomed pain 
that had come to live in his 
chest. It was like being sick, but 
he was not sick. It was not even 
an honest pain, caused by medi- 

56 



cine; it was just a kind of per- 
sisting crying ache that would 
not go away. 

He saw now, with the eye of 
disillusionment, that all his past 
gaiety had been foolish. Here he 
was in the last decade of his 
life, with fifty-two years behind 
him, and what could he show 
for it? Nothing but this ache of 
loss. His hand worked reflexively 
at the contents of his pocket and 
brought up a spiny handful: 
jackknife, pencil stub, assorted 
nails, a wad of grimy string, two 
marbles and an aggie, three pen- 
nies, a gray chip of rock with 
shiny specks on it, cracker 
crumbs and, over everything, 
pocket lint. Dust and ashes. 

A hot tear crawled up his 
cheek. 

The old man came into the 
room wearily, setting a broom 
down in the corner. He had been 
taking care of the house him- 
self, these last few days. Mrs. 
Hastings had disappeared and 
Sullivan did not think she was 
coming back. 

“Put your coat on, Larry,” said 
his father with a sigh. 

Q ULLIVAN did as he was 
^ told. In silence, they went 
out to the corner and waited for 
the streetcar. Gradually Sulli- 
van began to recognize the route 
they took. It was the same way 
they had gone that time when 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



he had his tonsils put in. A touch 
of fear came to him, but he en- 
dured it and said nothing. 

It was the hospital they were 
going to, all right. In the dark 
lobby, they did not look at each 
other. Sullivan’s father stood 
with his bowler hat in both hands, 
talking to a doctor, while Sullivan 
walked mechanically past him 
down the hall. 

Where was he going in this 
unpleasant dark place with its 
sharp smells of ether and formal- 
dehyde, and its clicking sharp- 
heeled nurses with sour faces 
over their trays? The closed 



doors moved past on either side. 

Sullivan stopped and turned, 
with an unaccountable tightness 
in his throat, and found himself 
facing a door like the others. But 
this one was going to open. 

The knob turned; Sullivan 
could not bear it. He wanted to 
rim, but felt rooted to the spot. 
What, oh, what was it? The door 
was opening, and inside, on the 
bed — 

A gray woman. Her tired eyes 
opened and she tried to smile at 
him. 

“Mother,” he said. /- .

FORECAST 



"Shoot the wad!" has always been the motto of this magazine . 
and your evidence that it's followed is the way we've recklessly printed 
every Theodore Sturgeon story as fast as it has come in, without holding 
out for replacements. We intend to go on doing just that. It's a nervous way 
of doing business, but writers like Sturgeon have an admirable habit of 
coming through— and not merely with usable material— but with tense, 
brilliant stories! 

For example, in next month's issue, Theodore Sturgeon offers a novella, 
THE OTHER MAN, that's in the same exalted class with his towering award- 
winning Baby Is Three. In THE OTHER MAN, he shows with dismaying impact 
how wholly, shockingly impossible it is for a tradition-smashing doctor to 
take a particular case— one reason, everybody knows; the other, he keeps 
entirely to himself— only there isn't a single way for him to get out of taking 
the impossible case! 

As a contrast, Arthur Sellings VERBAL AGREEMENT, a decidedly dis- 
agreeable problem of a novelet, puts an unsuccessful poet in another pickle: 
What would the aliens want one-half so precious as the incredibly beautiful 
animal skins they refuse to sell?

Early Model 

By ROBERT SHECKLEY 



Opening a new planet? Then take Bentley's 
advice — invulnerability is a great thing, 
but make doubly sure you don't overdo itl 



T HE landing was almost a 
catastrophe. Bentley knew 
his coordination was im- 
paired by the bulky weight on 
his back; he didn’t realize how 
much until, at a crucial moment, 
he stabbed the wrong button. 
The ship began to drop like a 
stone. At the last moment, he 
overcompensated, scorching a 
black hole into the plain below 
him. His ship touched, teetered 
for a moment, then sickeningly 
came to rest. 

Bentley had effected man- 
kind’s first landing on Tels IV.

His immediate reaction was to 
pour himself a sizable drink of 
strictly medicinal scotch. 

When that was out of the way, 
he turned on his radio. The re- 
ceiver was imbedded in his ear, 
where it itched, and the micro- 
phone was a surgically implanted 
lump in his throat. The portable 
sub-space set was self-tuning, 
which was all to the good, since 
Bentley knew nothing about nar- 
rowcasting on so tight a beam 
over so great a distance. 

“All’s well,” he told Professor 
Sliggert over the radio. “It’s an 
Earth-type planet, just as the 
survey reports said. The ship is 
intact. And I’m happy to report 
that I did not break my neck in 
landing.” 

“Of course not,” Sliggert said, 
his voice thin and emotionless 
through the tiny receiver. “What 
about the Protec? How does it 
feel? Have you become used to 
it yet?” 

T>ENTLEY said, “Nope. It still 
feels like a monkey on my 
back.” 

“Well, you’ll adjust,” Sliggert 
assured him. “The Institute sends 
its congratulations and I believe 
the government is awarding you 
a medal of some sort. Remember, 
the thing now is to fraternize 
with the aborigines, and if possi- 
ble to establish a trade agreement 
of some sort, any sort. As a prec- 

60 



edent. We need this planet, Bent- 
ley.” 

“I know.” 

“Good luck. Report whenever 
you have a chance.” 

“I’ll do that,” Bentley promised 
and signed off. 

He tried to stand up, but 
didn’t make it on the first at- 
tempt. Then, using the handholds 
that had been conveniently 
spaced above the control board, 
he managed to stagger erect. 
Now he appreciated the toll that 
no-weight extracts from a man’s 
muscles. H: wished he had done 
his exercises more faithfully on 
the long trip out from Earth. 

Bentley was a big, jaunty 
young man, over six feet tall, 
widely and solidly constructed. 
On Earth, he had weighed two 
hundred pounds and had moved 
with an athlete’s grace. But ever 
since leaving Earth, he’d had the 
added encumbrance of seventy- 
three pounds strapped irrevoca- 
bly and immovably to his back. 
Under the circumstances, his 
movements resembled those of 
a very old elephant wearing tight 
shoes. 

He moved his shoulders under 
the wide plastic straps, grimaced, 
and walked to a starboard port- 
hole. In the distance, perhaps 
half a mile away, he could see a 
village, low and brown on the 
horizon. There were dots on the 
plain moving toward him. The 

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



villagers apparently had decided 
to discover what strange object 
had fallen from the skies breath- 
ing fire and making an uncanny 
noise. 

“Good show,” Bentley said to 
himself. Contact would have been 
difficult if these aliens had shown 
no curiosity. This eventuality 
had been considered by the Earth 
Interstellar Exploration Institute, 
but no solution had been found. 
Therefore it had been struck 
from the list of possibilities. 

The villagers were drawing 
closer. Bentley decided it was 
time to get ready. He opened a 
locker and took out his lingua- 
scene, which, with some difficulty, 
he strapped to his chest. On one 
hip, he fastened a large canteen 
of water. On the other hip went a 
package of concentrated food. 
Across his stomach, he put 
a package of assorted tools. 
Strapped to one leg was the ra- 
dio. Strapped to the other was a 
medicine kit. 

Thus equipped, Bentley was 
carrying a total of 148 pounds, 
every ounce of it declared essen- 
tial for an extraterrestrial ex- 
plorer. 

The fact that he lurched rath- 
er than walked was considered 
unimportant. 

' I 'HE natives had reached the 

ship now and were gathering 
around it, commenting disparag- 



ingly. They were bipeds. They 
had short thick tails and their 
features were human, but night- 
mare human. Their coloring was 
a vivid orange. 

Bentley also noticed that they 
were armed. He could see knives, 
spears, lances, stone hammers 
and flint axes. At the sight of this 
armament, a satisfied smile broke 
over his face. Here was the justi- 
fication for his discomfort, the 
reason for the unwieldy seventy- 
three pounds which had remained 
on his back ever since leaving 
Earth. 

It didn’t matter what weapons 
these aboriginals had, right up to 
the nuclear level. They couldn’t 
hurt him. 

That’s what Professor Sliggert, 
head of the Institute, inventor of 
the Protec, had told him. 

Bentley opened the port. A cry 
of astonishment came from the 
Telians. His linguascene, after a 
few seconds’ initial hesitation, 
translated the cries as, “Oh! Ah! 
How strange! Unbelievable! Ri- 
diculous! Shockingly improper!” 

Bentley descended the ladder 
on the ship’s side, carefully bal- 
ancing his 148 pounds of excess 
weight. The natives formed a 
semicircle around him, their wea- 
pons ready. 

He advanced on them. They 
shrank back. Smiling pleasantly, 
he said, “I come as a friend.” The 
linguascene barked out the harsh 



EARLY MODEL 



61 



consonants of the Telian lan- 
guage. 

They didn’t seem to believe 
him. Spears were poised and one 
Telian, larger than the others 
and wearing a colorful headdress, 
held a hatchet in readiness. 

Bentley felt the slightest trem- 
or run through him. He was in- 
vulnerable, of course. There was 
nothing they could do to him, as 
long as he wore the Protec. Noth- 
ing! Professor Sliggert had been 
certain of it. 

T1EFORE takeoff, Professor 
Sliggert had strapped the 
Protec to Bentley’s back, ad- 
justed the straps and stepped 
back to admire his brainchild. 

“Perfect,” he had announced 
with quiet pride. 

Bentley had shrugged his 
shoulders under the weight. 
“Kind of heavy, isn’t it?” 

“But what can we do?” Slig- 
gert asked him. “This is the first 
of its kind, the prototype. I have 
used every weight-saving device 
possible — transistors, light alloys, 
printed circuits, pencil - power 
packs and all the rest. Unfortu- 
nately, early models of any in- 
vention are invariably bulky.” 

“Seems as though you could 
have streamlined it a bit,” Bent- 
ley objected, peering over his 
shoulder. 

“Streamlining comes much la- 
ter. First must be concentration, 

62 



then compaction, then group- 
function, and finally styling. It’s 
always been that way and it will 
always be. Take the typewriter. 
Now it is simply a keyboard, al- 
most as flat as a briefcase. But 
the prototype typewriter worked 
with foot pedals and required the 
combined strength of several men 
to lift. Take the hearing aid, 
which actually shrank pounds 
through the various stages of its 
development. Take the lingua- 
scene, which began as a very 
massive, complicated telectronic 
calculator weighing several 
tons — ” 

“Okay,” Bentley broke in. “If 
this is the best you could make 
it, good enough. How do I get 
out of it?” 

Professor Sliggert smiled. 

Bentley reached around. He 
couldn’t find a buckle. He pulled 
ineffectually at the shoulder 
straps, but could find no way of 
undoing them. Nor could he 
squirm out. It was like being in 
a new and fiendishly efficient 
strait jacket. 

“Come on, Professor, how do 
I get it off?” 

“I’m not going to tell you.” 

“Huh?” 

“The Protec is uncomfortable, 
is it not?” Sliggert asked. “You 
would rather not wear it?” 

“You’re damned right.” 

“Of course. Did you know that 
in wartime, on the battlefield, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



soldiers have a habit of discard- 
ing essential equipment because 
it is bulky or uncomfortable? But 
we can’t take chances on you. 
You are going to an alien planet, 
Mr. Bentley. You will be exposed 
to wholly unknown dangers. It is 
necessary that you be protected 
at all times.” 

“I know that,” Bentley said. 
“I’ve got enough sense to figure 
out when to wear this thing.” 
“But do you? We selected you 
for attributes such as resource- 
fulness, stamina, physical strength 
— and, of course, a certain 
amount of intelligence. But — ” 
“Thanks!” 

“But those qualities do not 
make you prone to caution. Sup- 
pose you found the natives seem- 
ingly friendly and decided to dis- 
card the heavy, uncomfortable 
Protec? What would happen if 
you had misjudged their atti- 
tude? This is very easy to do on 
Earth; think how much easier it 
will be on an alien planet!” 

“I can take care of myself,” 
Bentley said. 

S LIGGERT nodded grimly. 

“That is what Atwood said 
when he left for Durabella II and 
we have never heard from him 
again. Nor have we heard from 
Blake, or Smythe, or Korishell. 
Can you turn a knife-thrust from 
the rear? Have you eyes in the 
back of your head? No, Mr. 



Bentley, you haven’t — but the 
Protec has!” 

“Look,” Bentley had said, “be- 
lieve it or not, I’m a responsible 
adult. I will wear the Protec at 
all times when on the surface of 
an alien planet. Now tell me how 
to get it off.” 

“You don’t seem to realize 
something, Bentley. If only your 
life were at stake, we would let 
you take what risks seemed rea- 
sonable to you. But we are also 
risking several billion dollars’ 
worth of spaceship and equip- 
ment. Moreover, this is the Pro- 
tec’s field test. The only way to 
be sure of the results is to have 
you wear it all the time. The only 
way to ensure that is by not tell- 
ing you how to remove it. We 
want results. You are going to 
stay alive whether you like it or 
not.” 

Bentley had thought it over 
and agreed grudgingly. “I guess 
I might be tempted to take it 
off, if the natives were really 
friendly.” 

“You will be spared that temp- 
tation. Now do you understand 
how it works?” 

“Sure,” Bentley said. “But will 
it really do all you say?” 

“It passed the lab tests per- 
fectly.” 

“I’d hate to have some little 
thing go wrong. Suppose it pops 
a fuse or blows a wire?” 

“That is one of the reasons for 



EARLY MODEL 



63 



its bulk,” Sliggert explained pa- 
tiently. “Triple everything. We 
are taking no chance of mechan- 
ical failure. 

“And the power supply?” 

“Good for a century or better 
at full load. The Protec is per- 
fect, Bentley! After this field 
test, I have no doubt it will be- 
come standard equipment for all 
extraterrestrial explorers.” Pro- 
fessor Sliggert permitted himself 
a faint smile of pride. 

“All right,” Bentley had said, 
moving his shoulders under the 
wide plastic straps. “I’ll get used 
to it.” 

But he hadn’t. A man just 
doesn’t get used to a seventy- 
three-pound monkey on his back. 

* I , HE Telians didn’t know what 

to make of Bentley. They ar- 
gued for several minutes, while 
the explorer kept a strained smile 
on his face. Then one Telian 
stepped forward. He was taller 
than the others and wore a dis- 
tinctive headdress made of glass, 
bones and bits of rather garishly 
painted wood. 

“My friends,” the Telian said, 
“there is. an evil here which I, 
Rinek, can sense.” 

Another Telian wearing a sim- 
ilar headdress stepped forward 
and said, “It is not well for a 
ghost doctbr to speak of such 
things.” 

“Of course not,” Rinek admit- 



ted. “It is not well to speak of 
evil in the presence of evil, for 
evil then grows strong. But a 
ghost doctor’s work is the detec- 
tion and avoidance of evil. In 
this work, we must persevere, no 
matter what the risk.” 

Several other men in the dis- 
tinctive headdress, the ghost doc- 
tors, had come forward now. 
Bentley decided that they were 
the Telian equivalent of priests 
and probably wielded consider- 
able political power as well. 

“I don’t think he’s evil,” a 
young and cheerful-looking ghost 
doctor named Huascl said. 

“Of course he is. Just look at 
him.” 

“Appearances prove nothing, 
as we know from the time the 
good spirit Ahut M’Kandi ap- 
peared in the form of a — ” 

“No lectures, Huascl. All of us 
know the parables of Lalland. 
The point is, can we take a 
chance?” 

Huascl turned to Bentley. “Are 
you evil?” the Telian asked earn- 
estly. 

“No,” Bentley said. He had 
been puzzled at first by the 
Telians’ intense preoccupation 
with his spiritual status. They 
hadn’t even asked him where he’d 
come from, or how, or why. But 
then, it was not so strange. If an 
alien had landed on Earth during 
certain periods of religious zeal, 
the first question asked might 



64 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



have been, “Are you a creature 
of God or of Satan?” 

“He says he’s not evil,” Huascl 
said. 

“How would he know?” 

“If he doesn’t, who does?” 
“Once the great spirit G’tal 
presented a wise man with three 
kdal and said to him — •” 

And on it went. Bentley found 
his legs beginning to bend under 
the weight of all his equipment. 
The linguascene was no longer 
able to keep pace with the shrill 
theological discussion that raged 
around him. His status seemed 
to depend upon two or three dis- 
puted points, none of which the 
ghost doctors wanted to talk 
about, since to talk about evil 
was in itself dangerous. 

To make matters more com- 
plicated, there was a schism over 
the concept of the penetrability 
of evil, the younger ghost doctors 
holding to one side, the older to 
the other. The factions accused 
each other of rankest heresy, but 
Bentley couldn’t figure out who 
believed what or which interpre- 
tation aided him. 

YV/ - HEN the sun drooped low 
” over the grassy plain, the 
battle still raged. Then, suddenly, 
the ghost doctors reached an 
agreement, although Bentley 
couldn’t decide why or on what 
basis. 

Huascl stepped forward as 



spokesman for the younger ghost 
doctors. 

“Stranger,” he declared, “we 
have decided not to kill you.” 

Bentley suppressed a smile. 
That was just like a primitive 
people, granting life to an in- 
vulnerable being! 

“Not yet, anyhow,” Huascl 
amended quickly, catching a 
frown upon Rinek and the older 
ghost doctors. “It depends entire- 
ly upon you. We will go to the 
village and purify ourselves and 
we will feast. Then we will ini- 
tiate you into the society of ghost 
doctors. No evil thing can become 
a ghost doctor; it is expressly 
forbidden. In this manner, we 
will detect your true nature.” 

“I am deeply grateful,” Bent- 
ley said. 

“But if you are evil, we are 
pledged to destroy evil. And if 
we must, we can!” 

The assembled Telians cheered 
his speech and began at once the 
mile trek to the village. Now 
that a status had been assigned 
Bentley, even tentatively, the na- 
tives were completely friendly. 
They chatted amiably with him 
about crops, droughts and fam- 
ines. 

Bentley staggered along under 
his equipment, tired, but inwardly 
elated. This was really a coup! 
As an initiate, a priest, he would 
have an unsurpassed opportunity 
to gather anthropological data, 



EARLY MODEL 



65 



to establish trade, to pave the 
way for the future development 
of Tels IV. 

All he had to do was pass the 
initiation tests. And not get killed, 
of course, he reminded himself, 
smiling. 

It was funny how positive the 
ghost doctors had been that they 
could kill him. 

The village consisted of two 
dozen huts arranged in a rough 
circle. Beside each mud-and- 
thatch hut was a small vegetable 
garden, and sometimes a pen for 
the Telian version of cattle. 
There were small green-furred 
animals roaming between the 
huts, which the Telians treated 
as pets. The grassy central area 
was common ground. Here was 
the community well and here 
were the shrines to various gods 
and devils. In this area, lighted 
by a great bonfire, a feast had 
been laid out by the village 
women. 

13ENTLEY arrived at the 
feast in a etate of near-ex- 
haustion, stooped beneath his es- 
sential equipment. Gratefully, he 
sank to the ground with the vil- 
lagers and the celebration began. 

First the village women danced 
a welcoming for him. They made 
a pretty sight, their orange skin 
glinting in the firelight, their tails 
swinging gracefully in unison. 
Then a village dignitary named 

66 



Occip came over to him, bearing 
a full bowl. 

“Stranger,” Occip said, “you are 
from a distant land and your 
ways are not our ways. Yet let 
us be brothers! Partake, there- 
fore, of this food to seal the bond 
between us, and in the name of 
all sanctity!” 

Bowing low, he offered the 
bowl. 

It was an important moment, 
one of those pivotal occasions 
that can seal forever the friend- 
ship between races or make them 
eternal enemies. But Bentley was 
not able to take advantage of it. 
As tactfully as he could, he re- 
fused the symbolic food. 

“But it is purified!” Occip said. 

Bentley explained that, be- 
cause of a tribal taboo, he could 
eat only his own food. Occip 
could not understand that differ- 
ent species have different diet- 
ary requirements. For example, 
Bentley pointed out, the staff of 
life on Tels IV might well be 
some strychnine compound. But 
he did not add that even if he 
wanted to take the chance, his 
Protec would never allow it. 

Nonetheless, his refusal 
alarmed the village. There were 
hurried conferences among the 
ghost doctors. Then Rinek came 
over and sat beside him. 

“Tell me,” Rinek inquired aft- 
er a while, “what do you think 
of evil?” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Evil is not good,” Bentley said 
solemnly. 

“Ah!” The ghost doctor pon- 
dered that, his tail flicking ner- 
vously over the grass. A small 
green-furred pet, a mog, began 
to play with his tail. Rinek 
pushed him away and said, “So 
you do not like evil.” 

“No.” 

“And you would permit no evil 
influence around you?” 

“Certainly not,” Bentley said, 
stifling a yawn. He was growing 
bored with the ghost doctor’s tor- 
tuous examining. 

“In that case, you would have 
no objection to receiving the sa- 
cred and very holy spear that 
Kran K’leu brought down from 
the abode of the Small Gods, 
the brandishing of which confers 
good upon a man.” 

“I would be pleased to receive 
it,” said Bentley, heavy-eyed, 
hoping this would be the last 
ceremony of the evening. 

Rinek grunted his approval 
and moved away. The women’s 
dances came to an end. The 
ghost doctors began to chant in 
deep, impressive voices. The bon- 
fire flared high. 

Huascl came forward. His face 
was now painted in thin black 
and white stripes. He carried an 
ancient spear of black wood, its 
head of shaped volcanic glass, its 
length intricately although primi- 
tively carved. 



TT OLDING the spear aloft, 
Huascl said, “O Stranger 
from the Skies, accept from us 
this spear of sanctity! Kran K’leu 
gave this lance to Trin, our first 
father, and bestowed upon it a 
magical nature and caused it to 
be a vessel of the spirits of the 
good. Evil cannot abide the pres- 
ence of this spear! Take, then, 
our blessings with it.” 

Bentley heaved himself to his 
feet. He understood the value of 
a ceremony like this. His accept- 
ance of the spear should end, 
once and for all, any doubts as to 
his spiritual status. Reverently 
he inclined his head. 

Huascl came forward, held out 
the spear and — 

The Protec snapped into ac- 
tion. 

Its operation was simple, in 
common with many great inven- 
tions. When its calculator-com- 
ponent received a danger cue, 
the Protec threw a force field 
around its operator. This field 
rendered him invulnerable, for 
it was completely and absolutely 
impenetrable. But there were 
certain unavoidable disadvan- 
tages. 

If Bentley had had a weak 
heart, the Protec might have 
killed him there and then, for its 
action was electronically sudden, 
completely unexpected and phy- 
sically wrenching. One moment, 
he was standing in front of the 



EARLY MODEL 



67 



great bonfire, his hand held out 
for the sacred spear. In the next 
moment, he was plunged into 
darkness. 

As usual, he felt as though he 
had been catapulted into a 
musty, lightless closet, with rub- 
bery walls pressing close on all 
sides. He cursed the machine’s 
super-efficiency. The spear had 



not been a threat; it was part of 
an important ceremony. But the 
Protec, with its literal senses, had 
interpreted it as a possible dan- 
ger. 

Now, in the darkness, Bentley 
fumbled for the controls that 
would release the field. As usual, 
the force field interfered with his 
positional sense, a condition that 




68 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



seemed to grow worse with each 
subsequent use. Carefully he felt 
his way along his chest, where 
the button should have been, and 
located it at last under his right 
armpit, where it had twisted 
around to. He released the field. 

The feast had ended abruptly. 
The natives were standing close 
together for protection, weapons 




ready, tails stretched stiffly out. 
Huascl, caught in the force field’s 
range, had been flung twenty 
feet and was slowly picking him- 
self up. 

The ghost doctors began to 
chant a purification dirge, for 
protection against evil spirits. 
Bentley couldn’t blame them. 

When a Protec force field goes 
on, it appears as an opaque black 
sphere, some ten feet in diame- 
ter. If it is struck, it repels with 
a force equal to the impact. 
White lines appear in the 
sphere’s surface, swirl, coalesce, 
vanish. And as the sphere spins, 
it screams in a thin, high-pitched 
wail. 

All in all, it was a sight hardly 
calculated to win the confidence 
of a primitive and superstitious 
people. 

“Sorry,” Bentley said, with a 
weak smile. There hardly seemed 
anything else to say. 

TTUASCL limped back, but 
kept his distance. “You 
cannot accept the sacred spear,” 
he stated. 

“Well, it’s not exactly that,” 
said Bentley. “It’s just — well, 
I’ve got this protective device, 
kind of like a shield, you know? 
It doesn’t like spears. Couldn’t 
you offer me a sacred gourd?” 

“Don’t be ridiculous,” Huascl 
said. “Who ever heard of a sa- 
cred gourd?” 



EARLY MODEL 



69 




“No, I guess not. But please 
take my word for it — I’m not evil. 
Really I’m not. I’ve just got a 
taboo about spears.” 

The ghost doctors talked 
among themselves too rapidly 
for the linguascene to interpret. 
It caught only the words “evil,” 
“destroy,” and “purification.” 
Bentley decided his forecast 
didn’t look too favorable. 

After the conference, Huascl 
came over to him and said, 
“Some of the others feel that you 
should be killed at once, before 
you bring some great unhappi- 
ness upon the village. I told them, 
however, that you cannot be 
blamed for the many taboos that 
restrict you. We will pray for 
you through the night. And per- 
haps, in the morning, the initia- 
tion will be possible.” 

Bentley thanked him. He was 
shown to a hut and then the 
Telians left him as quickly as 
possible. There was an ominous 
hush over the village; from his 
doorway, Bentley could see little 
groups of natives talking ear- 
nestly and glancing covertly in 
his direction. 

It was a poor beginning for 
cooperation between two races. 

He immediately contacted 
Professor Sliggert and told him 
what had happened. 

“Unfortunate,” the professor 
said. “But primitive people are 
notoriously treacherous. They 

70 



might have meant to kill you 
with the spear instead of actu- 
ally handing it to you. Let you 
have it, that is, in the most 
literal sense.” 

“I’m positive there was no such 
intention,” Bentley said. “After 
all, you have to start trusting peo- 
ple sometime.” 

“Not with a billion dollars’ 
worth of equipment in your 
charge.” 

?^13UT I’m not going to be 
able to do anything!” 
Bentley shouted. “Don’t you un- 
derstand? They’re suspicious of 
me already. I wasn’t able to ac- 
cept their sacred spear. That 
means I’m very possibly evil. 
Now what if I can’t pass the ini- 
tiation ceremony tomorrow? Sup- 
pose some idiot starts to pick his 
teeth with a knife and the Protec 
saves me? All the favorable first 
impression I built up will be 
lost.” 

“Good will can be regained,” 
Professor Sliggert said senten- 
tiously. “But a billion dollars’ 
worth of equipment — •” 

“ — can be salvaged by the 
next expedition. Look, Professor, 
give me a break. Isn’t there some 
way I can control this thing 
manually?” 

“No way at all,” Sliggert re- 
plied. “That would defeat the en- 
tire purpose of the machine. You 
might just as well not be wear- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ing it if you’re allowed to rely 
on your own reflexes rather than 
electronic impulses.” 

“Then tell me how to take it 
off.” 

“The same argument holds 
true — you wouldn’t be protected 
at all times.” 

“Look,” Bentley protested, “you 
chose me as a competent explorer. 
I’m the guy on the spot. I know 
what the conditions are here. 
Tell me how to get it off.” 

“No! The Protec must have a 
full field test. And we want you 
to come back alive.” 

“That’s another thing,” Bentley 
said. “These people seem kind 
of sure they can kill me.” 

“Primitive peoples always 
overestimate the potency of 
their strength, weapons and 
magic.” 

“I know, I know. But you’re 
certain there’s no way they can 
get through the field? Poison, 
maybe?” 

“Nothing can get through the 
field,” Sliggert said patiently. 
“Not even light rays can pene- 
trate. Not even gamma radiation. 
You are wearing an impregnable 
fortress, Mr. Bentley. Why can’t 
you manage to have a little faith 
in it?” 

“Early models of inventions 
sometimes need a lot of ironing 
out,” Bentley grumbled. “But 
have it your way. Won’t you tell 
me how to take it off, though, 



just in case something goes 
wrong?” 

“I wish you would stop asking 
me that, Mr. Bentley. You were 
chosen to give the Protec a full 
field test. That’s just what you 
are goihg to do.” 

W HEN Bentley signed off, it 
was deep twilight outside 
and the villagers had returned 
to their huts. Campfires burned 
low and he could hear the call 
of night creatures. 

At that moment, Bentley felt 
very alien and exceedingly home- 
sick. 

He was tired almost to the 
point of unconsciousness, but he 
forced himself to eat some con- 
centrated food and drink a little 
water. Then he unstrapped the 
tool kit, the radio and the can- 
teen, tugged defeatedly at the 
Protec, and lay down to sleep. 

Just as he dozed off, the Pro- 
tec went violently into action, 
nearly snapping his neck out of 
joint. 

Wearily he fumbled for the 
controls, located them near his 
stomach, and turned off the field. 

The hut looked exactly the 
same. He could find no source of 
attack. 

Was the Protec losing its grip 
on reality, he wondered, or had 
a Telian tried to spear him 
through the window? 

Then Bentley saw a tiny mog 



EARLY MODEL 



71 



puppy scuttling away frantically, 
its legs churning up clouds of 
dust. 

The little beast probably just 
wanted to get warm, Bentley 
thought. But of course it was 
alien. Its potential for danger 
could not be overlooked by the 
ever-wary Protec. 

He fell asleep again and im- 
mediately began to dream that 
he was locked in a prison of 
bright red sponge rubber. He 
could push the walls out and 
out and out, but they never 
yielded, and at last he would 
have to let go and be gently 
shoved back to the center of the 
prison. Over and over, this hap- 
pened, until suddenly he felt his 
back wrenched and awoke within 
the Protec’s lightless field. 

This time he had real difficulty 
finding the controls. He hunted 
desperately by feel until the bad 
air made him gasp in panic. He 
located the controls at last un- 
der his chin, released the field, 
and began to search groggily for 
the source of the new attack. 

He found it. A twig had fallen 
from the thatch roof and had 
tried to land on him. The Protec, 

“Aw, come on now,” Bentley 
of course, had not allowed it. 
groaned aloud. “Let’s use a little 
judgment!” 

But he was really too tired to 
care. Fortunately, there were no 
more assaults that night. 

72 



H UASCL came to Bentley’s 
hut in the morning, look- 
ing very solemn and considerably 
disturbed. 

“There were great sounds from 
your hut during the night,” the 
ghost doctor said. “Sounds of 
torment, as though you were 
wrestling with a devil.” 

“I’m just a restless sleeper,” 
Bentley explained. 

Huascl smiled to show that he 
appreciated the joke. “My friend, 
did you pray for purification last 
night and for release from evil?” 
“I certainly did.” 

“And was your prayer grant- 
ed?” 

“It was,” Bentley said hope- 
fully. “There’s no evil around 
me. Not a bit.” 

Huascl looked dubious. “But 
can you be sure? Perhaps you 
should depart from us in peace. 
If you cannot be initiated, we 
shall have to destroy you — ” 
“Don’t worry about it,” Bent- 
ley told him. “Let’s get started.” 
“Very well,” Huascl said, and 
together they left the hut. 

The initiation was to be held 
in front of the great bonfire in 
the village square. Messengers 
had been sent out during the 
night and ghost doctors from 
many villages were there. Some 
had come as far as twenty miles 
to take part in the rites and 
to see the alien with their own 
eyes. The ceremonial drum had 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



been taken from its secret hiding 
place and was now booming sol- 
emnly. The villagers watched, 
chattered together, laughed. But 
Bentley could detect an under- 
current of nervousness and strain. 

There was a long series of 
dances. Bentley twitched wor- 
riedly when the last figure start- 
ed, for the leading dancer was 
swinging a glass-studded club 
around his head. Nearer and 
nearer the dancer whirled, now 
only a few feet away from him, 
his club a dazzling streak. 

The villagers watched, fasci- 
nated. Bentley shut his eyes, ex- 
pecting to be plunged momenta- 
rily into the darkness of the 
force field. 

But the dancer moved away 
at last and the dance ended with 
a roar of approval from the vil- 
lagers. 

Huascl began to speak. Bent- 
ley realized with a thrill of relief 
that this was the end of the cer- 
emony. 

“O brothers,” Huascl said, 
“this alien has come across the 
great emptiness to be our broth- 
er. Many of his ways are strange 
and around him there seems to 
hang a strange hint of evil. And 
yet who can doubt that he means 
well? Who can doubt that he is, 
in essence, a good and honorable 
person? With this initiation, we 
purge him of evil and make him 
one of us.” 



r T , HERE was dead silence as 
Huascl walked up to Bentley. 

“Now,” Huascl said, “you are 
a ghost doctor and indeed one 
of us.” He held out his hand. 

Bentley felt his heart leap 
within him. He had won! He had 
been accepted! He reached out 
and clasped Huascl’s hand. 

Or tried to. He didn’t quite 
make it, for the Protec, ever 
alert, saved him from the possi- 
bly dangerous contact. 

“You damned idiotic gadget!” 
Bentley bellowed, quickly find- 
ing the control and releasing the 
field. 

He saw at once that the fat 
was in the fire. 

“Evil!” shrieked the Telians, 
frenziedly waving their weapons. 

“Evil!” screamed the ghost 
doctors. 

Bentley turned despairingly to 
Huascl. 

“Yes,” the young ghost doctor 
said sadly, “it is true. We had 
hoped to cure the evil by our 
ancient ceremonial. But it could 
not be. This evil must be de- 
stroyed! Kill the devill” 

A shower of spears came at 
Bentley. The Protec responded 
instantly. 

Soon it was apparent that an 
impasse had been reached. Bent- 
ley would remain for a few min- 
utes in the field, then override 
the controls. The Telians, seeing 
him still unharmed, would renew 



EARLY MODEL 



73 



their barrage and the Protec 
would instantly go back into ac- 
tion. 

Bentley tried to walk back to 
his ship. But the Protec went on 
again each time he shut it off. 
It would take him a month or 
two to cover a mile, at that rate, 
so he stopped trying. He would 
simply wait the attackers out. 
After a while, they would find 
out they couldn’t hurt him and 
the two races would finally get 
down to business. 

He tried to relax within the 
field, but found it impossible. He 
was hungry and extremely 
thirsty. And his air was starting 
to grow stale. 

Then Bentley remembered, 
with a sense of shock, that air 
had not gone through the sur- 
rounding field the night before. 
Naturally — nothing could get 
through. If he wasn’t careful, he 
could be asphyxiated. 

Even an impregnable fortress 
could fall, he knew, if the defend- 
ers were starved or suffocated 
out. 

He began to think furiously. 
How long could the Telians keep 
up the attack? They would have 
to grow tired sooner or later, 
wouldn’t they? 

Or would they? 

He waited as long as he could, 
until the air was all but unbreath- 
able, then overrode the controls. 
The Telians were sitting on the 

74 



ground around him. Fires had 
been lighted and food was cook- 
ing. Rinek lazily threw a spear 
at him and the field went on. 

So, Bentley thought, they had 
learned. They were going to 
starve him out. 

UE TRIED to think, but the 
walls of his dark closet 
seemed to be pressing against 
him. He was growing claustro- 
phobic and already his air was 
stale again. 

He thought for a moment, then 
overrode the controls. The Tel- 
ians looked at him coolly. One 
of them reached for a spear. 

“Wait!” Bentley shouted. At 
the same moment, he turned on 
his radio. 

“What do you want?” Rinek 
asked. 

“Listen to me! It isn’t fair to 
trap me in the Protec like this!” 

“Eh? What’s going on?” Pro- 
fessor Sliggert asked, through 
the ear receiver. 

“You Telians know — ” Bentley 
said hoarsely — “you know that 
you can destroy me by continu- 
ally activating the Protec. I can’t 
turn it off! I can’t get out of it!” 

“Ah!” said Professor Sliggert. 
“I see the difficulty. Yes.” 

“We are sorry,” Huascl apolo- 
gized. “But evil must be de- 
stroyed.” 

“Of course it must,” Bentley 
said desperately. “But not me. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Give me a chance. Professor!” 
“This is indeed a flaw,” Pro- 
fessor Sliggert mused, “and a se- 
rious one. Strange, but things like 
this, of course, can’t show up in 
the lab, only in a full-scale field 
test. The fault will be rectified 
in the new models.” 

“Great! But I’m here now! 
How do I get this thing off?” 

“I am sorry,” Sliggert said. “I 
honestly never thought the need 
would arise. To tell the truth, I 
designed the harness so that you 
could not get out of it under any 
circumstances.” 

“Why, you lousy — ” 

“Please!” Sliggert said sternly. 
“Let’s keep our heads. If you 
can hold out for a few months, 
we might be able — ” 

“I can’t! The air! Water!” 
“Fire!” cried Rinek, his face 
contorted. “By fire, we will chain 
the demon!” 

And the Protec snapped on. 
Bentley tried to think things 
out carefully in the darkness. He 
would have to get out of the 
Protec. But how? There was a 
knife in his tool kit. Could he 
cut through the tough plastic 
straps? He would have to! 

But what then? Even if he 
emerged from his fortress, the 
ship was a mile away. Without 
the Protec, they could kill him 
with a single spear thrust. And 
they were pledged to, for he had 
been declared irrevocably evil. 



But if he ran, he at least had 
a chance. And it was better to 
die of a spear thrust than to 
strangle slowly in absolute dark- 
ness. 

T> ENTLEY turned off the field. 
-■-* The Telians were sur- 
rounding him with campfires, 
closing off his retreat with a wall 
of flame. 

He hacked frantically at the 
plastic web. The knife slithered 
and slipped along the strap. And 
he was back in Protec. 

When he came out again, the 
circle of fire was complete. The 
Telians were cautiously pushing 
the fires toward him, lessening 
the circumference of his circle. 

Bentley felt his heart sink. 
Once the fires were close enough, 
the Protec would go on and stay 
on. He would not be able to 
override a continuous danger 
signal. He would be trapped 
within the field for as long as 
they fed the flames. 

And considering how primi- 
tive people felt about devils, it 
was just possible that they would 
keep the fire going for a century 
or two. 

He dropped the knife, used 
side-cutters on the plastic strap 
and succeeded in ripping it half- 
way through. 

He was in Protec again. 

Bentley was dizzy, half-faint- 
ing from fatigue, gasping great 



EARLY MODEL 



75 



mouthfuls of foul air. With an 
effort, he pulled himself together. 
He couldn’t drop now. That 
would be the end. 

He found the controls, over- 
rode them. The fires were very 
near him now. He could feel 
their warmth against his face. He 
snipped viciously at the strap 
and felt it give. 

He slipped out of the Protec 
just as the field activated again. 
The force of it threw him into 
the fire. But he fell feet-first and 
jumped out of the flames with- 
out getting burned. 

The villagers roared. Bentley 
sprinted away; as he ran, he 
dumped the linguascene, the tool 
kit, the radio, the concentrated 
food and the canteen. He glanced 
back once and saw that the Tel- 
ians were after him. 

But he was holding his own. 
His tortured heart seemed to be 
pounding his chest apart and his 
lungs threatened to collapse at 
any moment. But now the space- 
ship was before him, looming 
great and friendly on the flat 
plain. 

He was going to just make it. 
Another twenty yards . 

Something green flashed in 
front of him. It was a small, 
green-furred mog puppy. The 
clumsy beast was trying to get 
out of his way. 

He swerved to avoid crushing 
it and realized too late that he 




76 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




should never have broken stride. 
A rock turned under his foot and 
he sprawled forward. 

He heard the pounding feet 
of the Telians coming toward 
him and managed to climb on 
one knee. 

Then somebody threw a club 
and it landed neatly on his fore- 
head. 

C? AR GWY dril?” a voice 
asked incomprehensibly 
from far off. 

Bentley opened his eyes and 
saw Huascl bending over him. 
He was in a hut, back in the vil- 
lage. Several armed ghost doc- 
tors were at the doorway, watch- 
ing. 

“Ar dril?” Huascl asked again. 

Bentley rolled over and saw, 
piled neatly beside him, his can- 
teen, concentrated food, tools, 
radio and linguascene. He took 
a deep drink of water, then 
turned on the linguascene. 

“I asked if you felt all right,” 
Huascl said. 

“Sure, fine,” Bentley grunted, 
feeling his head. “Let’s get it over 
with.” 

“Over with?” 

“You’re going to kill me, 
aren’t you? Well, let’s not make 
a production out of it.” 

“But we didn’t want to de- 
stroy you,” Huascl said. “We 
knew you for a good man. It was 
the devil we wanted!” 



77 



“Eh?” asked Bentley in a 
blank uncomprehending voice. 

“Come, look.” 

The ghost doctors helped Bent- 
ley to his feet and brought him 
outside. There, surrounded by 
lapping flames, was the glowing 
great black sphere of the Protec. 

“You didn’t know, of course,” 
Huascl said, “but there was a 
devil riding upon your back.” 

“Huh!” gasped Bentley. 

“Yes, it is true. We tried to 
dispossess him by purification, 
but he was too strong. We had to 
force you, brother, to face that 
evil and throw it aside. We knew 
you would come through. And 
you did!” 

“I see,” Bentley said. “A devil 
on my back. Yes, I guess so.” 

That was exactly what the 
Protec would have to be, to 
them. A heavy, misshapen weight 
on his shoulders, hurling out a 
black sphere whenever they tried 
to purify it. What else could a 
religious people do but try to 
free him from its grasp? 

He saw several women of the 
village bring up baskets of food 
and throw them into the fire in 
front of the sphere. He looked 
inquiringly at Huascl. 

“We are propitiating it,” 
Huascl said, “for it is a very 
strong devil, undoubtedly a mir- 
acle-working one. Our village is 
proud to have such a devil in 
bondage.” 



A ghost doctor from a neigh- 
boring village stepped up. “Are 
there more such devils in your 
homeland? Could you bring us 
one to worship?” 

Several other ghost doctors 
pressed eagerly forward. Bentley 
nodded. “It can be arranged,” he 
said. 

He knew that the Earth-Tels 
trade was now begun. And at 
last a suitable use had been found 
for Professor Sliggert’s Protec.

THE DEMOTION 
OF PLUTO 



P LUTO, outermost known 
planet of the Solar Sys- 
tem, is, of course, still 
technically a planet, since it 
moves around the Sun in a closed 
orbit. But it is now being said 
that Pluto did not always have 
full planetary status. It has been 
charged — by Dr. Gerard Peter 
Kuiper of the University of Chi- 
cago — with being a “runaway 
moon” of Neptune. 



THE DEMOTION OF PLUTO 



79 




I can’t make up my mind at 
the moment whether the charge 
that it is a former moon that 
managed to make itself inde- 
pendent should be considered 
detrimental to its reputation or 
whether that should enhance it. 
But if you take the position that 
being a runaway moon instead of 
a born planet is a demotion, you 
may also add that the demotion 
is richly deserved. Pluto simply 
failed to live up to the advance 
publicity it received as “Planet 
X” before its discovery. It has 
been a disappointment all along, 
for it did not turn out to be what 
one could reasonably have ex- 
pected. 

Seriously: the proper status of 
Pluto became dubious quite soon 
after the general jubilation fol- 
lowing its discovery by Clyde W. 
Tombaugh in 1930. Questions 
piled up quickly. Was it really 
the Planet X for which Percival 
Lowell had instituted a search? 
Did it really cause the gravita- 
tional effects from which its pres- 
ence and orbit had been calcu- 
lated? 

And was its final discovery, 
after years of diligent and diffi- 
cult search, possibly just due to 
a lucky accident? Was it possible 
that Planet X, predicted not only 
by Percival Lowell but by other 
astronomers as well, still remained 
completely unknown and yet to 
be discovered? 

80 



T^OR an astronomer to hunt 
one celestial body and dis- 
cover another is not as incred- 
ible as it may sound. One of the 
minor moons of Jupiter was found 
in just that way. And it has hap- 
pened repeatedly that an astron- 
omer “checked” on one asteroid 
only to find out, after a while, 
that he had actually discovered 
a new one. 

That such things do not hap- 
pen only in the crowded Asteroid 
Belt is shown by a famous case 
involving a transatlantic cable- 
gram. In Europe, they had dis- 
covered a new comet — not a very 
rare event if you have telescopic 
comets in mind. The observatory 
which made the discovery wanted 
it verified and cabled the fact of 
the discovery and the position of 
the object to the Lick Observa- 
tory. 

The telegraph operator, obvi- 
ously ignorant of astronomical 
notations, garbled the figures. 
Lick Observatory, of course, ac- 
cepted the figures that had been 
received, and when this particu- 
lar area of the sky became ob- 
servable, they looked. Quite close 
to the cabled position, a telescop- 
ic comet was found. 

It was a new comet — not the 
one the Lick astronomers had 
been asked to verify! 

It has become customary to 
say that the discovery of Pluto 
began with the discovery of Ura- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



nus by Sir William Herschel on 
March 13, 1781. While this state- 
ment can be maintained on the 
grounds that the discovery of 
Uranus showed that there were 
planets beyond Saturn, which 
had been accepted as the outer- 
most planet for so many centu- 
ries, there were actually many 
differences. 

When Herschel found Uranus, 
he had not been looking for a 
new planet. There was no suspi- 
cion that it might exist, no theo- 
retical reasoning assuming its ex- 
istence. Herschel simply found it 
and, as a matter of fact, he be- 
lieved for some time that he had 
merely discovered a new comet. 
After it had been established as 
a planet, it was located on quite 
a number of earlier star charts — 
17 in all — where unsuspecting 
observers had entered it as a 
fixed star. 

Using these older chance ob- 
servations and, of course, all the 
observations since the discovery 
by Herschel, Alexis Bouvard in 
Paris constructed tables of the 
motions of Jupiter, Saturn and 
Uranus. As far as Jupiter and 
Saturn were concerned, the tables 
and the observed positions agreed 
nicely. For Uranus, they did not 
agree. 

One way out of the difficulty 
was to assume that the older ob- 
servations had been careless — 
although there was no reason for 

THE DEMOTION OF PLUTO 



such a posthumous insult to able 
observers — and to discard them. 
Then new tables were calculated, 
based only on observations after 
Herschel’s discovery. 

A few years later, it became 
unmistakably clear that these ta- 
bles did not work, either. And in 
1834, an amateur astronomer, 
the Reverend T. J. Hussey, wrote 
a letter to Sir George B. Airy, in 
which he blamed an unknown 
planet outside the orbit of Ura- 
nus for the discrepancy between 
calculation and observation. 

r | ''HE view that an unknown 
planet might explain much 
became common among astrono- 
mers fairly fast. Professor F. B. 
G. Nicolai, then director of the 
observatory at Mannheim, said 
that this would best explain the 
fact Halley’s Comet did not be- 
have precisely as calculated. 
This was in 1835. 

In 1842, Friedrich Wilhelm 
Bessel, during a visit to Sir John 
Herschel, the son of the discov- 
erer of Uranus, declared that he 
was convinced that there was an 
unknown planet. After his return 
to Germany, he assigned his as- 
sistant to the task of calculating 
the position of an unknown plan- 
et from the observed discrep- 
ancies. But by that time, Bessel 
was no longer a young man; he 
died in 1846 and the job re- 
mained unfinished, at least as far 

81 



as Bessel’s discovery in Konigs- 
berg is concerned. 

But it had been completed 
just during those last few years 
of Bessel’s life in two other places. 

In France, Urbain J. J. Lever- 
rier presented his report on the 
calculation of the existence and 
position of a Trans-Uranian plan- 
et to the French Academy on 
November 10, 1845. 

In England, John Couch Ad- 
ams, a rather young man who 
had only recently received his 
bachelor’s degree, did the same 
work and forwarded his report 
to Sir George B. Airy around 
November 1st, 1845. 

There has been much unnec- 
essary discussion on whether pri- 
ority should be awarded to Ad- 
ams or to Leverrier. The plain 
fact is that both men did the 
same work at the same time. 
Since astronomical circles were 
well acquainted with the “mis- 
behavior” of Uranus, it is surpris- 
ing that more people were not 
attacking the same problem si- 
multaneously. 

TT MAY be worthwhile to pause 
for a moment here and ex- 
plain just what it was that made 
astronomers speak in such de- 
cided terms about an “unknown 
planet.” Let us first consider the 
case of a single planet moving 
around a sun. To simplify the 
picture still more, let us assume 

82 



that its orbit is not a ellipse, as 
it very likely would be, but a 
circle. In this case, the single 
planet would move at a constant 
rate; it would arrive at a certain 
point at a specific time. Now we 
add a second planet, which moves 
around the same sun, but in an 
orbit outside the orbit of the first 
planet. It will move at a slower 
rate and it also has to follow a 
much larger path. 

The result is that the inner 
planet will overtake the outer 
one at regular intervals. As the 
two come near each other, the 
effects of their own gravitational 
fields will enter into the game. 
They pull each other, and the 
inner planet moves a bit faster 
than it would if the other did not 
exist. By the same token, the 
outer planet is slowed down a 
bit. The closer they come to each 
other, the more strongly this mu- 
tual “perturbation” will show up. 

But at the instant the inner 
planet passes the outer planet, 
the effect is reversed. Now the 
inner planet is slowed down by 
the pull of the outer one, which 
falls behind, while the outer plan- 
et is speeded up a bit by the at- 
traction of the inner one that 
races ahead. 

In short, if a planet, at a cer- 
tain point of its orbit, first speeds 
up and then slows down, it indi- 
cates a gravitational pull by a 
body in an orbit farther away 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



from its sun. Conversely, a slow- 
ing down followed by a speed-up 
would indicate the presence of 
another body in an orbit nearer 
its sun. 

To return to the case of Ura- 
nus, it was slowed down a little 
and then suddenly pulled along 
by the gravitational fields of both 
Saturn and Jupiter. Their orbit, 
positions and weights were known 
and could be taken into account. 
But even when all the perturba- 
tions by Saturn and Jupiter had 
been figured in, calculations and 
observations obstinately failed to 
agree. 

Of course observers make mi- 
nor mistakes, but not all observ- 
ers make them in the same 
direction. Moreover, the discrep- 
ancies were too large to be as- 
cribed to “observational errors.” 
And the whole picture suggested 
a pull from “outside.” If astrono- 
mers had observed Uranus for 
several complete revolutions 
around the Sun, they could have 
established the period of the un- 
known planet outside of Uranus 
simply by tabulating the inter- 
val between two such perturba- 
tions that could not be ascribed 
to Saturn or to Jupiter. 

If they are so-and-so-many 
years apart, then the period of 
revolution of the external un- 
known body must be so-and-so- 
many years. It would have been 
simple. 



T>UT Uranus needs 84 years 
-■-* to go around the Sun once. 
In 1845, it had not been ob- 
served for even one complete 
revolution. You could stretch 
that by taking the older observa- 
tions, where the planet had been 
mistakenly entered on star charts 
as a star, but even then the evi- 
dence was spotty and the calcu- 
lation far from simple. To get 
anywhere, one assumption had 
to be made, concerning the dis- 
tance of the unknown planet 
from the Sun. 

John Couch Adams assumed 
a distance of 38.4 A. U. (astro- 
nomical units) — he expected 
the unknown planet to be 38.4 
times as far from the Sun as the 
Earth revolves around it. That 
assumption was according to the 
Bode-Titius rule (see Table I) 
which succeeds in expressing the 
distances of the planets from 
the Sim by simple arithmetic. 
Nobody quite knows why it 
works that way, even though 
there has been much thought ex- 
pended on just that problem. 

Even though we don’t know 
why, a glance at the table shows 
that it does work nicely for all 
the planets from Mercury to Ura- 
nus. There was no reason to as- 
sume that it should not work 
for the unknown planet, too, and 
Adams began his work by sup- 
posing that distance for the un- 
known body. 



THE DEMOTION OF PLUTO 



83 



As for Leverrier in France, he 
assumed a distance of 36.15 A.U. 
With either assumption, a case 
for an unknown planet could be 
worked out and both Adams and 
Leverrier could say that the 
planet should be in a given posi- 
tion along its orbit on a certain 
day. 

Adams picked October 1st, 
1846, as the day for which he 
made his calculation and stated 
that it should be in heliocentric 
longitude 328° or 329°. (The 
true position of Neptune for that 
day was 327°57'.) Leverrier 
picked January 1st, 1847, as his 
date and gave a heliocentric lon- 
gitude of 326°32' as the probable 
position of the unknown planet. 
The two independent calcula- 
tions agreed rather well, as one 
can see. 

r I ’HE next problem was, natu- 
rally, to find it in the sky. 
This meant searching the area 
of the calculated position more 



or less around the plane of the 
ecliptic, since all the planets of 
the Sun move in about the same 
plane as does the Earth. 

If this had to be done today, 
the observer would photograph 
that region of the sky, wait three 
days or so and photograph the 
same region again. Then he would 
settle down to the job of com- 
paring the plates in order to see 
whether one of the dots of light 
had moved during the time 
elapsed between exposures. There 
is a special instrument for doing 
just that, but even with this in- 
strument, it is tedious work. 
Moreover, a few known planets 
might move in the same area and 
have to be identified first. 

But in 1846, photography was 
not yet a help to the astronomer 
and the job had to be done visu- 
ally. The area of the sky had to 
be compared with prepared star 
charts to see whether an un- 
mapped dot of light had wan- 
dered in.

It is now known that the Brit- 
ish observer entrusted with the 
search by Airy actually saw Nep- 
tune, but failed to pay attention 
to it. His whole performance was 
such that it is safe to say that he 
wasn’t interested in the project 
and merely went through the mo- 
tions he had been ordered to 
make. 

Leverrier, in September, 1846, 
wrote to the German astronomer 
Galle in Berlin, who requested 
the permission of the director of 
the observatory, J. F. Encke, to 
proceed with the search. Encke 
approved and Galle, assisted by 
a student named H. L. d’ Arrest, 
went to work. He found it the 
same night and verified the dis- 
covery during the following 
night. 

Much later, it turned out that 
the French astronomer Lalande 
had seen the planet twice, on the 
8th and 10th of May, 1795. But 
since the “star” seemed to have 
shifted positions, Lalande con- 
cluded that he must have made 
a mistake in one of his observa- 
tions. The position which seemed 
less likely to him, for reasons we 
don’t know, he rejected com- 
pletely. The other one he deco- 
rated with a question mark and 
let it go at that! 

After Neptune had been dis- 
covered, it was only natural that 
virtually everybody wondered 
whether the story would be re- 

THE DEMOTION OF PLUTO 



peated. Of course first it was 
necessary to learn everything 
that could be learned about Nep- 
tune. 

Almost at once, its large moon 
Triton was discovered — by Wil- 
liam Lassell — and it was estab- 
lished that it was 220,000 miles 
from the planet, that its diame- 
ter must be around 3000 miles 
and that it needed 5.88 days to 
go once around Neptune. 

As for Neptune itself, it was 
slightly larger than Uranus, with 
a diameter of 33,900 miles (that 
of Uranus 30,900 miles) and 
that it turned around its axis at 
a rather fast rate, in 15 hours 
and 40 minutes. (Uranus does it 
in 10 hours and 40 minutes.) 
Neptune was not only slightly 
larger than Uranus but also heav- 
ier — it would take 14.7 Earths 
to balance Uranus on a scale; 
for Neptune, 17.2 Earths would 
be needed. 

I may add here, out of chro- 
nology, that Gerard P. Kuiper 
discovered a much smaller moon 
of Neptune in 1949. It is small, 
about 200 miles in diameter, and 
needs 730 days to go around the 
planet in a very elongated orbit. 

VW/ HILE Neptune compared to 
” Uranus and the other large 
outer planets in most respects, it 
proved to be surprising as far as 
its distance was concerned. It was 
8.8 astronomical units closer to

the Sun than the Bode-Titius 
rule said; it was 820 million miles 
farther inward in the Solar Sys- 
tem than one could reasonably 
expect. 

The main problem was not 
changed by this fact — whether 
the Bode-Titius rule missed in 
the case of Neptune or not, was 
there a planet still farther out? 
To derive its presence, provided 
it existed, from irregularities in 
the motion of Neptune, would 
have required a long wait, for 
Neptune needs almost 165 Earth 

86 



years for one revolution. But 
there were other leads one could 
follow. 

Comets, which have very little 
mass, are very strongly “per- 
turbed” by planets. It was the 
French astronomer Camille 
Flammarion who pointed to a 
comet thus “perturbed” and far 
outside the orbit of Neptune, at 
that. More of them were found 
after Flammarion had put the 
idea into some minds. Moreover, 
a planet beyond Neptune, a 
“Trans-Neptune,” would not only

cross Neptune's orbit 



perturb the orbit of Neptune; it 
would also show up in the mo- 
tions of Uranus, which by 1900 
had been observed for one and 
a half of its revolutions. 

There seemed to be enough 
evidence by then for Professor 
George Forbes to predict a 
Trans-Neptune at a distance of 



about 100 A. U., requiring 1000 
years for one complete revolu- 
tion. He expected it to be even 
larger than Jupiter in size! 

The German astronomer Dr. 
Theodor Grigull of Munster sup- 
posed a Trans-Neptune which he 
called “Hades” at a distance of 
50 A. U. with a period of revolu-

tion of 360 years and a size like 
Uranus or Neptune. 

Professor William H. Picker- 
ing came to a very similar con- 
clusion. His Trans-Neptune was 
a little farther out than Grigull’s, 
with a period of 373 years. 

And Thomas J[efferson] J[ack- 
son] See predicted the planet 
“Oceanus” at 41.25 A. U. with a 
period of 272 years. He went fur- 
ther — there probably was a 
Trans-Oceanus at 56 A. U. with 
a period of 420 years and still 
another at 72 A. U. with a period 



of somewhere around 610 years. 

The most careful set of calcu- 
lations was that of Percival Low- 
ell, published in 1915 under the 
title Memoir on a Trans-Nep- 
tunian Planet, which he called 
“Planet X.” He supposed it to be 
of about half the mass of Ura- 
nus, or seven Earth masses, with 
a period of around 280 years. 

One important difference be- 
tween Lowell and the other as- 
tronomers who had thought 
about the same problem was that 
he had his own observatory.

After having reached a theoreti- 
cal conclusion, he could start an 
actual search. He did not know, 
of course, that he was not to live 
much longer — he died in No- 
vember, 1916 — but all the time 
that was left to him, he hoped 
that one of his assistants would 
inform him about the actual dis- 
covery. 

HP H E announcement came 
more than 13 years after his 
death, on March 13, 1930. The 
date had a double significance — 
it was both the date on which 
Herschel had discovered Uranus 
and Percival Lowell’s birthday. 

Pluto really was discovered, 
though, in the afternoon of Feb- 
ruary 18, 1930, when Clyde W. 
Tombaugh examined two plates, 
taken on January 23rd and Jan- 
uary 30th, both centered on the 



star Delta Geminorum. Tom- 
baugh said later that he was sure 
at once — the two images were 
as sharp as those of stars (a 
comet image would have been 
somewhat diffuse) and the dis- 
placement was right for a planet 
beyond Neptune. 

Of the names that had been 
suggested for Planet X, the name 
Pluto was chosen, since it began 
with the letters P.L., the initials 
of the man who had predicted it. 
A comparison between the pre- 
diction and actuality is given on 
Table II, but it must be kept in 
mind that it took years until the 
figures for Pluto were established 
and that the values given in the 
last three lines did not become 
known until recently. 

But the searching questions 
arose soon. Pluto’s orbit, as it 
became known, was unlike that

and the tyro moons of Neptune. (The diameter of Pluto taken as 45 per cent of that of

of any other planet. It was 
strongly inclined to the ecliptic 
and so eccentric that the planet’s 
perihelion, the point of its orbit 
nearest the Sun, is actually closer 
than the nearest Neptune can 
come to the Sim, even though 
the average distance is greater. 
Pluto will go through its peri- 
helion. in 1989 and, for the period 
from 1969 to 2009, it will be 
closer to the Sun than Neptune. 
Aphelion, the point farthest from 
the Sun, will be reached in 2113. 
An orbit like that just did not sit 
well with a planet. 

The next question was its size. 
It was too small to show a disk 
in any telescope then in exis- 
tence. That meant that it had to 
be far smaller than Neptune, for 
even the Earth should still show 

90 



a tiny disk at that distance. 

But if it was smaller than the 
Earth, say somewhere between 
Earth and Mars in size, it could 
not possibly cause a measurable 
pertubation on planets as large 
and as distant from it as Uranus 
and Neptune. To make it cause 
the perturbations from which 
Planet X had been computed, 
its average density would have to 
be sixty times that of water. Such 
densities in a planet that size 
cannot exist. 

Then Kuiper succeeded in 
making some direct measure- 
ments. The first figure given, 
accompanied by the statement 
that the probable margin of error 
was large, was a diameter of 
6000 miles, 2000 miles less than 
that of the Earth. The next fig- 

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ure was 3700 miles, less than 
that of Mars, which is 4200 miles. 
Meanwhile, this has been re- 
vised downward some more, to 
around 3500 miles, which is the 
same as the diameter of Saturn’s 
largest moon, Titan. 

1 DON’T recall who said it first, 
but about ten years after 
Pluto’s discovery, somebody re- 
marked that it might merely be 
a runaway moon of Neptune. 
Pluto seemed to be about as far 
displaced north and south from 
the ecliptic as Neptune was “dis- 
placed” inward, if you took the 
Bode-Titius rule seriously. The 
total picture of the edge of the 
Solar System looked as if some- 
thing violent had taken place 
there at one time. 

Neptune was more than 800 
million miles closer to the Sun 
than it should be. Its then only 
known satellite Triton moved 
around it in the wrong direction 
and Uranus seemed to have been 
influenced to the extent of hav- 
ing its axis as well as the orbits 
of its satellites tilted by around 
90 degrees. Whatever it was 
that did all this could easily have 
torn Pluto away from Neptune 
and thrown it into the orbit it 
now has. 

But nobody could figure out a 
force which could tilt Uranus by 
90 degrees without disturbing its 
orbit and which could move Nep- 

THE DEMOTION OF PLUTO 



tune by 800 million miles with- 
out making its orbit eccentric. 

But one more discovery about 
Pluto makes it more likely than 
ever that it once was a moon of 
Neptune. Pluto had to have a 
period of rotation around its 
axis. But that period was not 
known until very recently, when 
it was found to be 6.39 days. 

This is much slower by far 
than the rotational period of any 
other of the outer planets. Only 
moons rotate that slowly around 
their axes, because all moons are 
forced by their planets into a 
period of axial rotation equal to 
the periods of their revolutions 
around their planets. If Pluto, 
when a moon of Neptune, was 
somewhat farther out than Tri- 
ton, a period of 6.39 days would 
be very logical. 

Dr. G. P. Kuiper thinks that 
Pluto made itself independent at 
a very early stage of the forma- 
tion of the Solar System. In fact, 
he believes that at that time Nep- 
tune lost Triton and Nereid, too, 
but later succeeded in recaptur- 
ing them. At any event, the dis- 
covery of the slow axial rotation 
of Pluto makes it certain that it 
is not the Planet X Percival 
Lowell and the others were pos- 
tulating. 

Whether Planet X exists is still 
uncertain. And where it is, if it 
exists, is still unknown.

Get away from it all — escape

Callisto! Drover did— and he 
walked into a human tornado l 



T HE fight began, really, 
with a simple comment 
that Mordecai Drover of- 
fered to nobody in particular 
while watching Dr. Helena Cur- 
tis, the Bartok Colony’s resident 
novelist, trying to finish her re- 
search before nightfall. He 
couldn’t fathom why the remark 
had set off such an explosion. 

After all, all he had said was, 
“I can never quite get used to it.” 
“What?” Henry Chatterton 
asked abstractedly. 



“Seeing a woman using an in- 
dex. It’s as outlandish a sight as 
a chimpanzee roller-skating.” 

At this precise moment, Cal- 
listo slid into Jupiter’s shadow 
and the nighttime clamor of the 
Bartok Colony began to rise rap- 
idly toward its sustained cre- 
scendo. Typewriters began to 
rattle one after the other, pianos 
to compete discordantly, a pho- 
nograph to grunt out part of Le 
Sacre du Prirttemps for Novgo- 
rod’s choreography pawns, and

collapsible tubes to pop air-bub- 
bles as paint was squeezed onto 
palettes. The computer, too, be- 
gan humming deep in its throat, 
for Dr. Winterhalter of the Spe- 
cial Studies section was trying to 
make it compose a sonata derived 
entirely from information theory. 

The clamor would last four 
hours and 53.9 minutes before 
beginning to taper off. 

Helena, however, made no 
move toward her typewriter. She 
closed her reference book with a 
savage snap, as though trying to 
trap a passing moth, and stood 
up. Mordecai, who had already 
plunged deep into Canto XVII 
of The Drum-Major and the 
Mask, failed to notice her glare 
until he became aware of an un- 
precedented silence in the Com- 
mons Room. He looked up. 

TT ELENA was advancing on 
him, step by step, each 
pace made more menacing by 
the peculiar glide Callisto’s slight 
gravity enforced. She was grace- 
ful under any circumstances; 
now she looked positively ser- 
pentine, and her usually full lips 
were white. Alarmed, Mordecai 
put down his pen. 

“Just what did you mean by 
that?” she asked. 

By what? Mordecai searched 
his memory frantically. At first, 
all he could come up with was 
the last strophe he had written, 



only a few seconds ago, and as 
yet he had no idea what he meant 
by that; the thing was badly 
flawed and needed revision be- 
fore even its author could know 
what it meant. 

Then he remembered the re- 
mark about women and indexes 
— indices? — already hours away 
in the fleet subjective time of 
Callistan night. 

“Why, it wasn’t anything,” he 
said wonderingly. “I mean you 
know how it is with chimpan- 
zees — ” 

“Oh, I do, do I?” 

“Well, maybe I didn’t — what I 
mean is, they get to be very skill- 
ful at unusual tasks — it’s just 
that you don’t expect them to be 
— Helena, it was only a joke! 
What good is a joke after it’s 
explained? Don’t be obstinate.” 

“Meaning don’t be obstinately 
stupid?” she said through her 
teeth. “I’ve had enough of your 
nasty innuendoes. If there’s any- 
thing I loathe, it’s a would-be 
genius with no manners.” 

Henry Chatterton’s smock was 
already spattered with egg tem- 
pera from top to bottom and the 
painting on his canvas was nearly 
a quarter finished. Slashing away 
at one corner of it with a loaded 
brush, he said out of the corner 
of his mouth: 

“We’ve had to put up with 
that viper’s tongue of yours long 
enough, Helena. Why don’t you

go hitch your flat frontispiece 
over your decollete novel and let 
the rest of us work?” 

“Now wait a minute,” John 
Rapaport said, flushing heavily 
and looking up from the dural 
plate on which he had been 
sketching. “By what right does 
an egg-coddler go out of his way 
to insult a craftsman, Chatter- 
ton? If you have to dip that 
brush of yours in blatherskite, 
save it for your daubs — never 
mind smearing it over Helena.” 

Chatterton swung around in 
astonishment and then began to 
smirk. 

“So thafs how it’s going to 
be! Well, Johnny boy, con- 
gratulations. But I predict that 
you’ll find five hours makes a 
very, very long night. Don’t say 
an expert didn’t warn you.” 

Rapaport swung. His engrav- 
ers’ point flew accurately at Chat- 
terton’s left eye. The painter 
ducked just in time; the tool 
stuck, quivering, in his canvas. 
He took one look at it and rushed 
on Rapaport, howling. Mordecai 
would have been out of the way 
with no difficulty, if Helena’s 
open hand had not caught him a 
stinging blow across the chops at 
the crucial moment. Then he and 
Chatterton went over. 

The noise quickly attracted 
the rest of the happy family. Only 
fifteen minutes after Mordecai’s 
innocent remark, the Commons 



Room was untidily heaped with 
geniuses. 

It looked like a long night. 

B ECAUSE Mordecai, a month 
before, had fumbled so long 
and so helplessly with his space- 
suit until an impatient crewman 
had decided to help him dog it 
down, he had almost been 
dumped out of the airlock, and 
the ship’s captain barely gave 
him time to get clear before tak- 
ing off again. Within a few sec- 
onds, it seemed, he had been 
more alone than he had ever been 
in his life. 

He had stood still inside the 
suit, because he could do nothing 
else, and fumed. Actually, he 
knew, he was more afraid than 
angry, though he was thoroughly 
furious with himself, and with 
Martin Hope Eglington, his men- 
tor. It certainly hadn’t been Mor- 
decai’s idea to come to Jupiter 
IV. He had never even been in 
space before, not even so far as 
the Moon, and had had no desire 
to go. 

Nevertheless, here he was, un- 
der a sky of so deep a blue that 
it was almost black and full of 
sharp cold stars, even though it 
was midday. The Sun was a min- 
iature caricature of itself, shed- 
ding little light and no apparent 
heat. There was nothing else to 
be seen but a wilderness of tum- 
bled rocks, their sharp edges and 



THE GENIUS HEAP 



95 



spires protruding gauntly through 
deep layers of powdery snow, all 
the way to the near horizon. The 
fact that Mordecai could hear a 
faint sighing whistle outside his 
suit, as of the saddest and weak- 
est of all winds, did not cheer 
him. 

It had begun, as such things 
usually did with Mordecai, with 
what had seemed an innocent 
question, this time one asked by 
someone else. Eglington had been 
helping him with the prosody of 
The Drum Major and the Mask, 
Mordecai’s major poem thus far, 
cast as a sirvente to Wallace Ste- 
vens. They had swinked at it all 
day in Eglington’s beautiful and 
remote Vermont home. Morde- 
cai had now been Eglington’s only 
protege; there was a time when 
the Pulitzer Prize winner had 
maintained a sort of salon of 
them, but now he was too old 
for such rigors. 

I ’’HAT’S enough for now,” 
Eglington had said, shortly 
after dinner. “It’s really shaping 
up very well, Mordecai, if you 
could just get yourself past try- 
ing to compress everything you 
know into one phrase. In a poem 
of this length, at least a little 
openness of texture is desirable 
— if only to let the reader into 
it.” 

“I see that now. Whew! When 
I first got started, nobody told 

96 



me poetry could be such hard 
work.” 

“All real poetry is hard work; 
that’s one of its telltales. Tell me 
something, Mordecai — when do 
you do most of your work? I 
don’t mean your best work, nec- 
essarily; at what hours of the 
day do you find that you work 
most easily, can concentrate best, 
put the most out?” 

That had been easy to answer. 
Mordecai’s work habits had been 
fixed for fifteen years. “Between 
about eight at night and two in 
the morning.” 

“I thought so. That’s true of 
most creative people, including 
scientists. The exact hours vary, 
but the fact is that most of the 
world’s creative work — and cre- 
ative play; it’s the same thing — 
is done at night.” 

“Interesting,” Mordecai had 
said. “Why is that, do you sup- 
pose?” 

“Oh, I don’t have to suppose. 
The answer is known. It’s be- 
cause, during those hours, the 
whole mass of the Earth is be- 
tween you and the Sun. That 
protects you from an extremely 
penetrating kind of solar radia- 
tion, made up of particles called 
neutrinos. The protection is neg- 
ligible statistically, because all 
matter is almost perfectly trans- 
parent to neutrinos, but it seems 
that the creative processes are 
tremendously sensitive to even 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the slightest shielding effect.” 
“Too bad they can’t be blocked 
off completely, then. I’d like to 
be able to work days. I just 
can’t.” 

“You can, if you want to un- 
dergo some privations in the 
process,” Eglington had said, al- 
most idly. “Ever hear of the Bar- 
tok Colony?” 

“Yes, it’s a retreat of some 
sort. Never went in for that kind 
of thing much myself. I work bet- 
ter alone.” 

“I see you don’t know where 
it is. It’s on Callisto.” 

The notion had startled and 
somewhat repelled Mordecai, for 
whom the neutrinos had already 
been almost too much. He would 
expect Eglington to know about 
such things — he was not called 
“the poet of physics” for nothing 
— but Mordecai had no interest 
in them. “On Callisto? Why, for 
heaven’s sake?” 

“Well, for two reasons,” Eg- 
lington had said. “First of all, be- 
cause at that distance from the 
Sun, the raw neutrino flux is 
only about three point seven per 
cent of what it is here on Earth. 
The other reason is that for near- 
ly five hours of every two weeks 
— that is, every Callistan day — 
you have the small bulk of the 
satellite plus the whole mass of 
Jupiter between you and the 
Sun. For that period, you’re in 
a position to work your creative 



engine with almost no neutrino 
static. I’m told that the results, 
in terms of productivity, are truly 
fantastic.” 

“Oh,” Mordecai had said. “It 
seems like an extreme measure, 
somehow.” 

TC'GLINGTON had leaned for- 
ward, intensely serious. 
“Only extreme measures produce 
great work, Mordecai. Tell me — 
what was the big change in Man 
that differentiated him perma- 
nently, qualitatively, from all 
other species?” 

“The opposable thumb,” Mor- 
decai had said promptly. 

“Wrong. The opposable thumb 
helps Man to handle things, it 
stimulates curiosity, it gets the 
world’s work done. It is, if you 
like, a device of daylight. But 
the ability to think in abstrac- 
tions is the big skill that Man 
has and that is an ability that 
works mostly at night. Second 
question: why was fire Man’s 
most important discovery?” 

“Well, it helped him to get 
more nourishment out of his 
food,” Mordecai said, but more 
cautiously now. 

“That’s minor. What else?” 

Mordecai had known he was 
well out of his depth by that 
time. He simply shook his head. 

“Independence of the Sun, 
Mordecai. That one gain has 
permanently arrested Man’s evo- 



THE GENIUS HEAP

lution. Without it, he was devel- 
oping a number of specialized 
types for different environments: 
the bushman, the pigmy, the Es- 
kimo, and so on. Fire not only 
halted the process, but reversed 
it; the devolution set in. Now we 
don’t have to adapt to our en- 
vironments; we can carry our 
own wherever we go. In that 
way, we protect ourselves from 
adapting away from abstract 
thinking and toward some purely 
physical change that will make 
it unnecessary for us to think.” 

Eglington had paused and 
sniffed reflectively at his brandy. 
Then, with apparent irrelevance, 
he had added Do you tell your 
relatives what your work hours 
are?” 

“Not by a long shot. They’re 
all alarm-clock types. They think 
I’m lazy as it is; if I told them I 
didn’t get up until noon, they’d 
be sure of it.” 

“Exactly. Daylight encourages 
monkey - thinking, practicality, 
conformity, routine operation. It’s 
at night that Man-thinking gets 
done. During the day, there are 
the twinges about the regular 
paycheck, keeping the family 
fed, making your relatives proud 
of you, taking no chances, and 
all the rest of that rot. ‘Early to 
bed and early to rise’ is nothing 
but an invitation to put your 
head into a horse-collar. The 
man who stays in bed all day 
isn’t a lazy slob; he’s a man who’s

very sensibly protecting his valu- 
able human brains from the mon- 
key-drive.” 

“You make a good case,” Mor- 
decai had said admiringly. 

“I really think you ought to 
go, Mordecai. I’ll give you a let- 
ter to the chairman; he’s at the 
Earth headquarters at MIT. I’m 
quite sure I can swing it.” 

jl/l’ORDECAI had felt a belat- 
ed surge of alarm. “But, 
Martin, wait a minute — ” 

“Don’t worry; you’ll be admit- 
ted. Anyhow, you’ve gone as far 
as you can go with me. Now you 
need to strike out on your own 
— and this is the way to do it.” 
And so Mordecai Drover, on 
Jupiter IV, frightenedly had been 
waiting for somebody from the 
Bartok Colony to pick him up. 
He did not feel a particle more 
creative than he had felt at his 
worst moments back home. Rath- 
er less, as a matter of fact. 

A stirring in the middle dis- 
tance drew his attention belated- 
ly. Something like a bug was 
coming toward him. As it came 
closer, he saw that it was a sort 
of snowmobile, with huge fat 
tires and a completely sealed 
cabin. He let out a gasp of relief. 

“Hello,” his suit radio said, in 
a voluptuous feminine voice. 
“Stand fast, Mr. Drover; we have 
you on the radar. Welcome to 
Bartok Colony.” 

The voice virtually trans- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



formed Callisto for Mordecai; if 
there was one historical period 
in which he would most liked to 
have lived, it was that of Mar- 
lene Dietrich. When, half an 
hour later, he found that Dr. Hel- 
ena Curtis strongly resembled 
that — alas! — long-dead Helen 
of the age before space flight, he 
had been suddenly, as Eglington 
probably had expected, ready to 
stay on Callisto forever. 

“Now there are only two 
rules here,” Dr. Hamish Cren- 
shaw, the Colony’s director, had 
begun murmuring in Mordecai’s 
ear while his suit was being 
stripped off him. “First of all, we 
have no facilities for children; 
you’ll understand, I’m sure, and 
forgive us when I tell you that 
we — uh — Take Steps. Dietary 
steps; you’ll never notice them, 
but we like to be honest. And 
the other rule is Get Along. We’re 
all one family here and we try 
not to quarrel.” 

“Oh, of course not,” Mordecai 
had said, but he hadn’t really 
been listening. 

A FTER the fight, the Colony’s 
surgeon — a staff member, 
not a guest — gave Mordecai a 
hyaluronidase injection for his 
black eye and dismissed him 
without ceremony. Evidently the 
brawl in the Commons Room 
had produced several more seri- 
ous wounds. Mordecai prowled 
the corridors morosely for a 



while, but kept meeting people 
he had only recently been fight- 
ing with — or, at least, trying to 
fight out from under. He finally 
went back to his own cubicle 
and tried to resume The Drum- 
Major and the Mask. 

It was hopeless. The cacoph- 
ony of noise in the station had 
hardly bothered him after the 
first strange night, but now he 
couldn’t think through it. He 
wondered how the others had 
stood it for so long. Neutrinos or 
no neutrinos, his own brain was 
generating nothing but blots. 

Besides, he felt almost intoler- 
ably guilty. After all, his remark 
had been unfeeling, especially 
after what had happened two 
nights ago (or a month ago, as he 
kept thinking of it). That had 
been one of the unexpected ef- 
fects of night on Jupiter IV: the 
same shielding that liberated the 
creative impulse seemed to liber- 
ate the libido as well. In four 
hours and 53.9 minutes, two peo- 
ple could fall in love, become 
passionately and exclusively at- 
tached to each other, and fall ex- 
plosively out of love before the 
night was over — a process that 
would have taken months or 
years on Earth. 

No wonder the Colony, as Dr. 
Crenshaw had put it, Took Steps 
against the possibility of children. 

But was it Mordecai’s fault 
that Helena was the most beau- 
tiful woman in the Colony and 



THE GENIUS HEAP 



99 



hence the most frequent figure in 
these amours and explosions? Be- 
sides, he had suffered, too. He 
could hardly find it comfortable 
to be out" of love with Dietrich, 
after having had adored her im- 
age hopelessly since he was old 
enough to distinguish pants from 
trousers. He doubted that he 
would ever write another love 
poem again. 

The corridors of the Colony 
began to resound with a series 
of hoots and shrieks, as loud as 
though they were being heard by 
an insect trapped in a steam cal- 
liope. Dr. Winterhalter had once 
again begun to hope, and had 
wired the computer’s output di- 
rectly to the Hammond organ; 
the computer’s current notion of 
what a sonata ought to sound like 
was rattling the doors in their 
sockets. The computer had not 
yet quite solved the music of the 
spheres. The Cadre to . Suppress 
Dr. Winterhalter, made up of all 
the musicians in the Colony, 
would be stampeding past Mor- 
decai’s door at any moment. 

Yet after all, he told himself, 
the remark hadn’t been any more 
virulent than many of the things 
that got said daily in the Colony, 
and Helena had always been one 
of the worst offenders; Chatter- 
ton had been right about that. 
Even at home, Mordecai recalled 
with nostalgia, nighttime was the 
time you said things that you re- 
gretted the next day. He had al- 

100 



ways attributed that looseness of 
tongue to the dulling of inhibi- 
tions by fatigue (or, of course, 
alcohol), but since it was so much 
worse here, maybe the double- 
damned neutrinos had been re- 
sponsible for that too. Or maybe 
they hadn’t. If you coop thirty 
highly individualistic people in 
one sealed can on a cheerless ice- 
ball like Callisto, you should ex- 
pect tempers to get somewhat 
frayed. 

Whatever the answer, Morde- 
cai wanted out. There was no 
doubt in his mind that being in 
the Colony had increased his 
productivity markedly, but it 
wasn’t worth the constant emo- 
tional upheavals. 

TT E PEERED up and down 
the corridor to make sure 
he would not be run over by the 
Cadre, and then set off deter- 
minedly for the office of Dr. 
Hamish Crenshaw. There was no 
sense in postponing matters. 

As he passed Helena Curtis’ 
closed door, however, he paused. 
Maybe one postponement could 
do no harm. There was another 
question nagging at him, which 
he suddenly decided was more 
important. He knocked tenta- 
tively. 

Helena opened the door and 
stared at him, her eyes coldly 
furious. “Beat it,” she said. 

“I don’t mean to interrupt,” 
Mordecai said humbly. “I apolo- 

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



gize for my remark. It was nasty 
and inexcusable. Also, I’ve got 
something I’d like to discuss with 
you.” 

“Oh?” For a moment, she sim- 
ply continued to glare at him. 
Then, gradually, some of the un- 
friendliness seemed to die away. 
“Well, it’s decent of you to apol- 
ogize. And that beastly squabble 
did sour me on Rapaport just in 
time; maybe I owe you an apol- 
ogy, too. What’s on your mind?” 
“I want to know what you 
know about old Walker Good- 
acre — the man who founded the 
Colony. I’m beginning to think 
there’s a joker buried somewhere 
and he may be it.” 

“Hm. All right, come on in. 
But no monkeyshines, Mordecai.” 
“Certainly not,” he said inno- 
cently. “That’s part of the prob- 
lem, Helena. This setup is sup- 
posed to encourage what they 
call ‘Man-thinking’ and it does 
seem to have that effect — but it 
also seems to bring out all the 
monkey-emotions. I’m starting to 
wonder why.” 

“Well,” Helena said, sitting 
down thoughtfully, “they say the 
neutrinos — ” 

“Hang the neutrinos! I mean 
let’s just forget about them for 
the time being and think about 
what the Colony’s supposed to 
accomplish. We should begin with 
the history; there’s where you can 
help, right at the beginning. How 



is the Colony actually run?” 

“By a board of directors, ad- 
ministering the Goodacre estate,” 
she said. “The place was origi- 
nally founded by Goodacre him- 
self; he put ten million dollars 
into a special trust to build the 
place and then bequeathed an- 
other ten to keep it going. The 
Colony is run off the interest 
from the bequest.” 

A LL right. What kind of man 
was Goodacre?” Mordecai 
asked. “I mean aside from the 
fact that he was a rich man. 
Wasn’t he also a scholar of stat- 
ure? I seem to remember that 
he was.” 

“Oh, yes,” Helena said. “He 
was a sociologist, considered one 
of the most eminent of his time. 
Mordecai, if you’re suggesting 
that this whole thing is an ex- 
periment and we’re just experi- 
mental animals, you’re wasting 
your breath. The newspapers 
milked all the melodrama out of 
that when the Colony was first 
founded. Of course, it’s an experi- 
ment; what of it?” 

“Of course. But what kind of 
experiment? Look here, Helena, 
you know more history than I 
do. A lot more. Think back on 
the history of bequests to artists. 
Do they usually come from men 
who are artists or scholars them- 
selves? It’s my impression that 
they don’t. More usually, they 



THE GENIUS HEAP 



101 



come from men who are not cre- 
ative themselves and feel guilty 
or frustrated about it — men 
whose money was often made by 
dubious means in the first place, 
so some of it is given away to 
the most ‘disinterested’ people 
the rich man can imagine, in ex- 
piation. Like the Nobel Prizes — 
money made from dynamite. 
Only a cultural cipher could 
dream of an artist as ‘disinter- 
ested’ in that sense.” 

“I can think of a few excep- 
tions,” Helena said, “but only 
partial ones. In that respect, old 
Goodacre was an unusual case. 
I’ll grant you that.” 

“Right. Now it’s my judgment 
that this experiment as it was 
outlined to us is working very 
badly. Yet Goodacre was a top 
sociologist, you tell me; why 
should the biggest experiment he 
ever designed, being run strictly 
in accordance with his wishes, be 
so miserable a failure?” 

“Well, sociology’s not an exact 
science — ” 

“I had the notion that it’d be- 
come much more exact since 
Rashevsky, at least. And I think 
it might be more sensible to as- 
sume that old Goodacre did know 
what he was doing and that this 
mess is exactly the outcome he 
wanted. Why did he want it?” 
“Mordecai,” Helena said slow- 
ly, “I apologize again and this 
time I mean it. Let’s see how 

102 



close we can get to the bottom 
of this before the night’s over.” 

“Why stop then?” Mordecai 
urged. “It’s only a question of 
fact — no creativity involved.” 

In this, of course, he was a lit- 
tle underestimating himself. De- 
duction is creative; Mordecai had 
simply had too little experience 
with it to realize the fact. 

TOURING the succeeding days, 
Dr. Hamish Crenshaw ap- 
peared to be indulging in a series 
of improvised attempts to pre- 
vent further brawls by dividing 
the sheep from the goats, with- 
out having quite made up his 
mind how to tell one animal 
from the other. His first move 
was to forbid working in the 
Commons Room, which did noth- 
ing but stop work in the Com- 
mons Room; it utterly failed to 
prevent brawling there, and it 
was impossible for the director 
to close the Commons Room en- 
tirely. 

Then he tried to reshuffle the 
room assignments so that all the 
guests whose records carried the 
fewest marks for quarrels would 
wind up on one side of the Col- 
ony and the most quarrelsome 
guests on the other. The net gain 
here was fewer bruises sustained 
by accident by the least quar- 
relsome. The most quarrelsome 
continued to quarrel, more fre- 
quently now because they were 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



deprived of the calming effects 
sometimes exerted by the cooler 
heads. 

After this had become suffi- 
ciently obvious to all, Dr. Cren- 
shaw decided to reshuffle the 
rooms according to talent. This 
was abortive. Everybody at Bar- 
tok Colony, except the staff, was 
supposed to be a leader in his 
field, so Crenshaw apparently 
concluded that the only way to 
measure talent was by age: young 
poets, for example, were sheep, 
old poets goats. Since there was 
only one poet in the Colony at 
the moment — Mordecai — the 
plan foundered on Mordecai’s 
obvious inability to baa and bleat 
at the same time from opposite 
sides of the dome. 

But nothing seemed to discour- 
age Dr. Crenshaw. He tried to 
segregate the sexes. This pro- 
duced the biggest riot in the Col- 
ony’s history. The next move in 
the game of musical chairs was 
to lump all the practitioners of 
the noisy arts — music, ballet, 
sculpture — into one group and 
those who quietly wrote or paint- 
ed into the other. The concentra- 
tion of noise made it worse than 
it had been when diffused and 
in no way decreased the squab- 
bling. 

The most recent solution was 
a curfew. The rules were that 
everyone had to be in his room 
by nightfall and had to stay there 



until the night was over. All gath- 
erings were forbidden, but excep- 
tions were made for teams (“such 
as composer-and-librettist,” Dr. 
Crenshaw had added with what 
he seemed to think was great 
tact). This move really made a 
difference; it actually cut the 
quarreling in half. 

It also cut productivity right 
back down to the daytime level, 
even in the naturally solitary 
arts. 

“Which I think is what you’ve 
been aiming for all along,” Mor- 
decai told Crenshaw grimly, in 
Crenshaw’s office. “All the other 
silly rules were designed to con- 
vey an illusion of bumbling des- 
peration, to disguise the curfew 
as just one more example of the 
same.” 

/CRENSHAW laughed disarm- 
ingly but a look at Mordecai 
and Helena evidently convinced 
him that neither had been disarm- 
ed. 

He put his hands together on 
his desktop and leaned forward 
confidingly. 

“Now that’s a peculiar theory,” 
he said, still smiling. “Suppose you 
tell me why you think so.” 

“It’s in keeping with the whole 
philosophy,” Mordecai said. “Dr. 
Curtis and I have been doing 
considerable research lately and 
we’ve come up with some con- 
clusions we don’t like. Among 



THE GENIUS HEAP 



103 



other things, we talked to Dr. 
Ford.” 

Crenshaw frowned. Dr. Ford 
was the colony’s staff physicist. 
The statement that he had been 
talking to guests obviously did 
not please the director. 

“We found out a few things 
about the neutrino notion that 
we hadn’t known before,” Mord- 
ecai went on. “Dr. Ford says that 
neutrinos go through ordinary 
matter as if it weren’t there. Back 
home on Earth, the neutrino flux 
is so great that there are a hun- 
dred neutrinos passing through 
a space the size of a matchbox 
at any given instant — yet even 
detecting their existence was one 
of the hardest problems physicists 
ever tackled. He says the differ- 
ence between the night and the 
day flux on Earth has never been 
measured.” 

“Never by instruments,” Cren- 
shaw said smoothly. “But the hu- 
man brain measures it; it’s a very 
delicate detector.” 

“That’s pure hypothesis,” He- 
lena retorted. “Dr. Ford says that 
to capture the average neutrino 
would take a lead barrier fifty 
light-years thick. Under those con- 
ditions, exceptional captures with- 
in a human brain must take place 
on the order of once every mil- 
lion years or more.” 

“We considered all this in set- 
ting up the Colony,” Crenshaw 
said. “We do have people like Dr. 

104 



Ford on our staff, after all. Ob- 
viously the neutrino-capture the- 
ory was not proven. It was a 
conjecture. But we’ve been in 
operation for quite a few years 
now and the empirical evidence 
has been adding up all during 
that time. Your own personal 
experience should confirm it. 
There is a definite increase in 
creativity out here and particu- 
larly when we are in the Jovian 
shadow.” 

H E leveled a finger at them or, 
rather, between them. “This 
is one reason why I don’t like to 
have physicists like Ford shoot- 
ing off their mouths to our guests. 
Physicists don’t understand the 
artistic temperament and artists 
generally don’t know enough 
about physicists to be aware of 
their limitations. You didn’t know, 
for instance, the real meaning 
behind what Ford was telling you. 
I do know: he was complaining 
that the neutrino theory is based 
upon the concept that the brain 
acts as an organic detector, and 
the ground rules of his science 
don’t allow organic dectors. Since 
you had no way of knowing this 
and, like most lay people, you 
regard physicists as minor gods, 
you’re shaken up. You’ve allowed 
him to discredit not only your 
belief in the Colony, but even 
the evidence of your own experi- 
ence!” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



CCT^ERY plausible,” Mordecai 
* said. “But experience isn’t 
evidence until it’s put in order 
and there’s always more than one 
possible order. Dr. Curtis and I 
don’t know much about physi- 
cists, it’s true, but we do know 
something about artists. We know 
that they’re highly suggestible. 
They have to be or they’d be in 
some other trade. Convince them 
that they’re going to be more 
creative in the dark of the moon, 
or after a course of mescal, or 
in the Jovian neutrino shadow, 
and most of them will be more 
creative, whether there’s any mer- 
it in the actual notion you’ve 
sold them or not.” He grinned 
reminiscently. “I once knew a wri- 
ter whose work was largely un- 
salable, so he had to have a reg- 
ular job to stay alive. He devel- 
oped the notion that he had to be 
fired at least once a year in order 
to maintain his productivity. 
Sooner or later, toward the end 
of each job year, he was fired — 
and it did increase his writing 
output for a while. What has 
that to do with neutrinos?” 
“Nothing,” Crenshaw said. “A 
single example never has anything 
to do with anything except it- 
self. But let’s suppose for the 
sake of argument that the neut- 
rino theory is not only shaky, 
but entirely wrong. Have you 
anything better to offer? Until 
we discover just what creativity 



actually is — what goes on in the 
brain to produce it — we’ll never 
really know whether it’s possible 
for a neutrino to interfere with 
that process. In the meantime, 
the empirical evidence we collect 
here in the Colony adds up.” 

“Adds up to what?” Mordecai 
demanded. 

Crenshaw only shrugged. 

“Dr. Crenshaw,” Helena said, 
“maybe there is something in the 
neutrino theory all the same. I’m 
perpared to admit the possibility 
— but I don’t think it makes any 
difference. We know that artists 
always produce best under stress, 
either personal or societal — it 
doesn’t matter what kind. If pro- 
duction increases in this Colony, 
it’s because conditions here for 
a resident artist are worse than 
those he had to work under back 
home — not better. No wonder 
production dropped when you cut 
down our internecine warfare. 
You’ve always had it in your 
power to reduce those quarrels, 
but you didn’t choose to exercise 
it until now.” 

“Why now?” Crenshaw inquir- 
ed gently. 

“To cut down on the amount 
of our work that gets home, of 
course,” Mordecai said, amazed 
that the man could continue 
such an obvious rear-guard de- 
fense after his major defenses 
had been breached. “Dr. Cren- 
shaw, we know that old Good- 



THE GENIUS HEAP 



105 



acre knew what he was doing. 
He was interested in the role of 
the artist in society. He was ask- 
ing himself: Does society really 
need these creative people? Does 
it really want them around? Are 
the things they produce worth 
having, weighed against the dam- 
age that they do just by being 
alive and impinging upon normal 
people? So he contrived this ex- 
periment.” 

C RENSHAW said, “I don’t see 
the point.” But he was sweat- 
ing. 

“We do. Above all, old Good- 
acre wanted to know this: What 
would happen to society if, gen- 
eration after generation, the 
cream of its artists is skimmed 
off, the artists sent into exile — 
and their work returned to Earth 
only at a measurable, controll- 
able rate? Take architecture, for 
instance: you skim Gropius off 
one generation, Wright off an- 
other, and so on, and what’s left? 
Draftsmen, Tenderers, workhorses, 
without anybody to stir them in- 
to a ferment. Sooner or later, 
Earth has no creativity left in 
its gene-pool but the kind that 
makes men into engineers and 
scientists — and mightn’t that be 
just as well, in the long run? 
That’s the question this Colony 
is set up to answer, and brilliantly, 
too.” 

Crenshaw sighed. 



After a while, Helena said: 
“Well?” 

‘Well, what?” Crenshaw asked 
tiredly. “I’m not going to tell you 
you’re right or wrong or way off 
base. No matter what conclusions 
you come to, I still have to stay 
here and administer this mad- 
house. I’m not Goodacre; I just 
work here.” 

“That’s what the guards at 
Dachau said,” Mordecai said. 

“The question is, what do you 
plan to do?” 

“Go home,” Mordecai stated im- 
mediately. 

“And how do you plan to do 
that? You signed a contract when 
you came here. In addition to 
your legal ties, you can’t leave 
here until I personally say you 
can. I can simply deny you pas- 
sage, deny you knowledge of the 
ship schedules — there are half a 
hundred other knots I can tie 
you in. Why not just sit and 
take it? It won’t last forever.” 

“Of course it won’t,” Helena 
said grimly. “But we’re not sheep, 
nor Judas-goats. Suppose the ex- 
periment ends by proving that 
society can get along without us? 
Then we’d never get home at 
all, no matter what the contract 
says.” 

Crenshaw looked down at his 
hands, and then up again. His 
expression was now one of frank 
boredom. “That may well be true. 
However, I deny it for the record. 



106 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



And now I have work to do. 
Thank you for coming to see me.” 

Mordecai grinned. Crenshaw 
had obviously never thought of 
him as a conspirator and Mor- 
decai was savoring the surprise. 

“There are other people wait- 
ing to see you,” he said. He got 
up and opened the door. 

r I ''HERE were others, all right. 

There was Novgorod and his 
highly muscular group of dancers; 
Henry Chatterton, his beard brist- 
ling and his smock-pockets loaded 
with eggs far too far gone to 
make decent egg tempera; John 
Rapaport with his bottles of acid 
and his beltful of nastily pointed 
little engravers’ tools; Dr. Winter- 
halter with a sheaf of papers full 
of calculations on orbits and 
schedules to Earth; and quite a 
few additional “harmless artists.” 
They looked anything but harm- 
less now. 

“We’re going home,” Mordecai 
said. “Maybe society would like 
to get along without us, but we 
aren’t going to let it. It won’t 
catch us again by offering us a 
nice workroom, where it’s always 
as quiet as three o’clock in the 
morning. We don’t need that kind 
of phony solitude — we carry the 
real thing with us wherever we 
go, even when we’re fighting 
among ourselves. Do you under- 
stand that?” 

“No,” Crenshaw said hoarsely. 



“I don’t think I do understand.” 
Mordecai took Helena’s hand 
as she rose. “Then you didn’t 
study your experimental animals 
thoroughly enough. If you had, 
you would have found that one 
of them, F. Scott Fitzgerald, knew 
the flaw in your experiments a 
whole century ago and wrote it 
down.” 

“What— was it?”’ 

“ ‘In a real dark night of the 
soul,’ ” quoted Mordecai, “ ‘it is 
always three o’clock in the morn- 
ing.’ "

THE GENIUS HEAP 



107 




THE CITY AND THE STARS 
by Arthur C. Clarke. Harcourt, 
Brace & Co., $3.75 

W HEN Against the Fall of 
Night appeared in 1953, 
virtually everyone agreed that 
here was one of the finest science 
fiction novels in years. In his 
foreword to the present book, 
Clarke explains his dissatisfaction 
with the earlier work and exer- 
cises his prerogative to rewrite it. 

The revision is certainly as in- 
triguing in relating the mission 
of Alvin, the sole malcontent in 
the billion-year-old city of Dias- 
par, which had gone unchanged 
108 



since its creation at the moment 
that Man gave up the stars. The 
immortal inhabitants of the city 
are tied to its environs by an an- 
cestral fear of the invaders, leg- 
endary enemies who purportedly 
had driven Man back to his na- 
tive Earth and sequestered him 
within this one city. 

Marvelous it is, with its guid- 
ing brain, the Central Computer, 
and its Memory Banks which 
contain the electronic patterns of 
every food, article of furniture, 
indeed every human born and re- 
born into Diaspar in its clever 
method of immortality. But Al- 
vin, a Unique, never having a 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



prior incarnation* is possessed of 
a driving discontent with it. 

His incomprehensible urge 
eventually has repercussions, but 
it is not the function of this re- 
view to give them away. 

For those who have read the 
first version of this book, per- 
haps you will wonder, along with 
me, why the author should have 
been unhappy with such a supe- 
rior work. Is he like Alvin, his re- 
bellious hero? 

THE RETURN OF THE KING 
by J. R. R. Tolkien. Houghton 
Mifflin Co., $5.00 

WT HEN, after finishing a book, 
you continue holding the 
volume in limp hand, with a far- 
away look, you know you’ve had 
a genuine reading experience. 
Here it is. 

This is the final volume in a 
trilogy, The Lord of the Rings. 
The previous two books, The Fel- 
lowship of the Ring and The Two 
Towers, saw the formation of the 
Fellowship to combat the evil 
powers of the Dark Lord, Sauron. 
Man, Dwarf, Elf and Hobbit join 
in mutual pact to destroy the 
Ring, which alone gives Evil 
power over the forces of Good. 

It sounds downright silly as a 
synopsis, but it becomes a grip- 
ping adventure in the hands of a 
master like Tolkien. These were 
the days of Middle Earth when 



natural forces were wilder than 
today and supernatural forces 
wilder still. The trance quality of 
the narrative is comparable to 
that other hypnotic masterpiece 
of fantasy, The Worm Ouroboros 
by E. R. Eddison — recommenda- 
tion enough. 

THE BEST FROM FANTASY 
AND SCIENCE FICTION, Fifth 
Series, Edited by Anthony Bou- 
cher. Doubleday & Co. $3.50 

’ I ’HE publication of this year’s 
F & S F anthology is some- 
thing less than an event. Editor 
Boucher, to paraphrase Rev. Sid- 
ney Smith, tries to overcome 
gravity by an excess of levity. 

Despite the coyness of the col- 
lection, some of the individual 
stories are worthy efforts, such 
as “Pottage,” another of Zenna 
Henderson’s haunting stories of 
The People, outcasts from space 
upon Earth, hiding their wild tal- 
ents through fear of reprisal; 
“Created He Them,” Alice Elea- 
nor Jones’ disturbing vision of a 
future world. 

The other assets are yarns by 
Asimov, Knight, Clarke and Ray- 
mond E. Banks. Knight in par- 
ticular has a daffy tale that ex- 
plains just about every frustra- 
tion you might have been sub- 
ject to and also has possibly the 
wildest scene in science fiction, 
in which he uses every cliche in

the repertoire as a spurious ex- 
planation of his hero’s dilemma. 

Used as spice, the Knight story 
would add taste to the collection. 
But as Mrs. Murphy undoubted- 
ly would have said, Boucher 
dumped so much of it into the 
chowder that he spoiled the over- 
all flavor. 

CRY HUNGER by Sidney Bliss. 
Vantage Press, Inc., $2.75 

A N UNUSUAL book in many 
ways — subject matter, 
treatment, even its inclusion in 
this review. Semantically speak- 
ing, it is science-fiction, since it 
concerns a scientific experiment 
and it certainly is fictitious. The 
experiment in question involves 
the starvation of a group of col- 
lege students, volunteers, to de- 
termine whether morality, reli- 
gious convictions, sex standards, 
etc., are affected by variations in 
or curtailment of diet. 

The author is qualified for his 
task, having headed the Dept, of 
Biochemistry at Tulane, and also 
by his wartime post of chief of 
Military Nutrition in the Sur- 
geon General’s Office. Artistically 
speaking, however, the author’s 
scientific background is not suf- 
ficient to provide more than a 
very moderately interesting dis- 
course on sexuality and homo- 
sexuality. These he certainly airs 
without fears, but one wonders 

no 



if it was necessary to go through 
an entire book to prove a scien- 
tific point that few would argue. 

MEN, ROCKETS AND SPACE 
RATS by Lloyd Malian. Julian 
Messner, Inc., $5.95 

"|y" EEPING informed on man- 
kind’s progress toward space 
travel becomes a lighter task be- 
cause of this book. It is written 
in the manner of a novel of high 
adventure. The author sets the 
stage for each episode so that the 
famous real-life characters come 
to glowing life. 

For instance, he tells how one 
night, while engaged in his search 
for Pluto, Professor Clyde Tom- 
baugh almost froze to death in 
the observatory, could count on 
no aid and only ingenious think- 
ing enabled him to get out of his 
tight spot. This sole living discov- 
erer of a major planet has since 
come up with a camera that can 
detect a tennis ball 1,000 miles 
out in space. 

From Dr. Robert Goddard’s 
early experiments at Roswell, 
New Mexico, Malian takes us in 
fascinating anecdotes down to 
the present accelerated rocket 
program of the U. S. at White 
Sands Proving Grounds. One ex- 
ample: did you know that the 
naval use of JATO during the 
war hinged on a crew-chief’s 
slightly off-color trick of loading 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a regulation flying boat off-cen- 
ter so it would lose its race with 
another boat assisted by JATO? 
Nice job. 

You’ll like it. 

THE GOLDEN PROMISE by 
Stanley Zuber. Pageant Press, 
Inc., $3.00 

S TANLEY ZUBER is an ex- 
patriate Czech at present 
living in Canada. This is his first 
novel in English and he has vis- 
ualized a world society founded 
on the Brotherhood of Man. The 
capital of Canerica, Oremont, is 
the seat of a world convention 
to establish a unified language. 
The chief protagonists are cul- 
tured and beautiful, as who 
wouldn’t be with only a couple 
of hours’ mandatory labor to 
perform? Free time is given over 
to individual amatory pursuits, 
and author Zuber gives us count- 
less instances. 

There is no dramatic action 
anywhere in the book, which re- 
lies, not too successfully, on con- 
flict for affection between the 
main characters, becoming far 
too involved for the small satis- 
faction gained. The book suffers 
also from an excessive artiness 



created by its narration in pres- 
ent tense. 

ROCKET MAN by Lee Correy. 
Henry Holt & Co., $2.75 

T> EADING this book, like 
reading any Heinlein ju- 
venile, fills me with a sort of ret- 
roactive envy of modern-day 
kids. We' never had stories like 
this when we were kids. Yes, we 
had Tarzan, Tom Swift and John 
Carter. But how did Carter get 
to Mars? With the twang of a 
harp string! Rocket Man is a 
story of a Martian voyage, but 
the hero gets to Mars on more 
than a string. 

It is a highly believable yarn 
about a New York lad who has 
never seen a spaceship, his ac- 
ceptance at the New Mexico Col- 
lege of Science and Engineering 
and his appointment in the Space 
Force. The author is situated at 
White Sands Proving Ground in 
New Mexico and very evidently 
writes with considerable knowl- 
edge of his subject. But no dry 
treatise, Rocket Man brings the 
world of 2002 excitingly near. If 
you have a teen-ager with starry 
eyes, this is his ticket to space.

The Claustrophile 

By THEODORE STURGEON 



Every once in a while, along comes a story 
like this that turns "common sense" around 
— and plumps it down squarely on its feet! 



ft 



P 



| ASS Mr. Magruder the 
hominy, Chris!” His 
mother’s mild, tired 
voice at last penetrated. “For 
pity’s sakes, son, how many 
times — ” 



But Tess Milburn came to his 
rescue, reaching a thin arm, a 
sallow hand, to the dish of grits 
and passing it down to the 
boarder. Mr. Magruder didn’t 
say anything. He never said any-

thing. He never ate hominy grits, 
either, but that wasn’t the point. 
When Miz Binns set out the din- 
ner, everything had to be passed 
to everybody, no matter what. 

Chris sighed and mumbled he 
was sorry. He let his mind drift 
back to the three-body problem. 
He knew he couldn’t solve the 
three-body problem, but he 
couldn’t be satisfied that it was 
impossible. Chris Binns was a 
computer mechanic, a good one, 
and what he was really pursuing 
was (a) the right question to 
ask the (b) right kind of ma- 
chine. 

He frowned at the problem as 
if he could squeeze an answer 
out of his brow, and almost had 
what he wanted when he became 
aware that he had impaled Tess 
Milburn with his unseeing gaze 
and was scowling fiercely at her. 
She smiled, that brief, weak 
showing of teeth that she did in- 
stead of blushing. It was Chris 
who blushed, a very little, but 
already he was sliding back into 
his thoughts, away from embar- 
rassment, apology, even from the 
dinner table. 

The solution, he thought, lies 
here: that it’s fair to consider all 
three orbits as ellipses and the 
final solution as a predictable re- 
lationship between the lengths of 
one focal axis of each. He saw, 
clearly, a circular cam riding a 
parabolic track, and the linkage 

114 



between three such tracks and 
their cams trembled in the wings 
of his intellect, ready for the 
spotlight, the entrance — 

Wham! 

The screen door slammed back 
against the verandah wall and a 
heavy suitcase simultaneously 
struck the floor by the table. 

“Hit the blockhouse!” roared 
a heavy baritone. “ ’Ware my 
tailjets! I’m a-comin’ in!” 

“Billy! Oh, Billy!” cried Miz 
Binns. 

S HE was on her feet with her 
arms out, but couldn’t use 
them before she Was caught up 
and swung around by the laugh- 
ing giant who had hit the floor 
right by the suitcase. 

Tess Milburn sat astonished, 
stopped, like some many-func- 
tioned machine when its mas- 
ter switch is thrown; chewing, 
breathing, blinking, probably 
heartbeat, certainly cerebration, 
all ceasing at once in the face of 
something she had no reflexes 
for. 

Mr. Magruder made a sound 
that would have been a grunt if 
it had been vocalized, and bent 
to pick up the fork he had 
dropped. With no change of ex- 
pression, he scrubbed it with his 
napkin and then went on eating. 

Chris Binns sat with his eyes 
closed, to all appearances as fro- 
zen as the girl, but inwardly in an 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



agony of activity as he pursued 
his vanished thought, humbly 
asking only for their shape and 
texture, not their whole sub- 
stance, something he could find 
again and rebuild on. But it was 
not possible; the lights were out 
inside, the doors closed. He blew 
gently through his nostrils, mak- 
ing up his mind to try again 
some time, and opened his eyes. 
“Hi, Bill.” 

The cadet put his mother 
down. “Contact, shipmate!” he 
said thunderously. His hair was 
crisp, sun-colored; his shoulders 
bulged under the short, full cape 
of the space-blue topcoat. Its 
four buttons, gold, white, green, 
red for the inner planets, glit- 
tered in their midnight back- 
ground as he flung himself on his 
brother. Chris, flailing away the 
accurate and painful pounding 
of the cadet’s greeting, suddenly 
giggled foolishly, slid his chair 
back, bent sideways. 

“Hi. Hi.” 

“And if it isn’t little old Tessie 
Heartburn,” Billy roared, bestow- 
ing an explosive kiss on Tess 
Milburn’s cheek. “And Old Faith- 
ful himself, star boarder extraor- 
dinary, conversationalist par 
ex — ” His heavy hand was 
stopped abruptly in its descent 
to the old man’s shoulder appar- 
ently by nothing more than Mr. 
Magruder’s quick glance upward. 
The hand raised again, to be a 



facetious, almost insulting salute. 
“Mr. Magruder.” 

Mr. Magruder nodded once, 
curtly, and went about the busi- 
ness of eating. 

Miz Binns fluttered and clucked 
and cried. “Billyboy, oh, it’s so 
good to, why didn’t you tell us 
you were, have you had your, 
now, Tess, if you’ll just move a 
little this way and, Chris, just, 
and I’ll set you another — ” 
“You wired you’d be here in 
the morning,” said Chris. 

‘“Sun always comes up when 
little Billee walks in,” grinned 
the cadet. “But ack-shull, ship- 
mate, I got a ride in a supply 
truck, begged off final inspection, 
and jatoed out.” He looked swift- 
ly around the table. “Where’s 
Horrible Horrocks?” 

“Billy!” squeaked his mother. 
“Miss Horrocks got transferred 
to another school,” said Chris. 
“Thought we wrote you about 
it.” 

“Oh, yes. Forgot. Read through 
the home gossip real fast,” said 
Billy carelessly. 



jt/TlZ BINNS said, “Mr. Ma- 
ITx gruder found us a new 
boarder for her room. A Miss 
Gerda Stein. We thought she’d 
be settled in by the time you 
arrived. But you didn’t arrive to- 
morrow, did you?” 

Billy laughed and kissed her. 
“I sure didn’t arrive tomorrow. 



THE CLAUSTROPHILE 



115 



I’m going to arrive ten minutes 
ago.” 

“Oh-h, you know what I . 
silly-Billy. Chris, come help me.” 

Chris looked at her numbly 
for a moment, then got to his 
feet, jostling the table. Billy 
laughed and said, “I know you, 
Mom. You don’t need help. 
You’ve got secrets.” He turned 
grinning to Tess Milburn. 
“They’re prolly going to talk 
about you.” 

“Oh, Billy, you’re awful, just 
awful,” his mother said pinkly. 
Mr. Magruder only steadied his 
water glass as Chris bumped the 
table, and then began to butter 
a roll. Tess Milburn gave her 
embarrassed lip-flicker, and Miz 
Binns said, “Don’t you listen to 
that wicked boy, Tess,” and shook 
a fond finger at Billy. She made 
an abrupt beckoning motion and 
disappeared into the kitchen. 

Chris followed her out. She 
stood by the door, and when he 
was in the room, she reached 
out a practiced hand and stopped 
the door from swinging. With the 
ignorance of acoustics apparently 
possible only to mothers, she be- 
gan speaking intensely in a whis- 
per which was totally inaudible 
to him, pointing and flapping to- 
ward the dining room, moving 
her lips too much and her jaw 
not at all. 

“What?” he asked, not too 
softly. He was mildly irritated. 

116 



She cast her eyes up to heaven 
and shushed him violently. She 
took his arm and backed across 
the kitchen, looking past his 
shoulder all the while as if she 
expected everyone in the dining 
room to be pressing ears to the 
door. “I said what did you have 
to go and have her for dinner to- 
night of all nights, Billy home 
and all?” 

“We had a date. Besides, I 
didn’t know Billy was — ” 

“It’s very inconsiderate,” she 
complained. 

“Well, what do you want me 
to do?” 

“It ought to be sort of a family 
thing, your brother home from 
school.” 

The irritation rose to as high 
as it ever got with Chris — not 
very high. “Then let’s get rid of 
Mr. Magruder, too.” 

“That’s different and you know 
it.” 

He did know it. Mr. Magruder 
had his own bubble of life within 
the lives they all led and he 
stayed unbreakably within it. He 
communed with himself, his 
newspaper and his habits, which 
were so regular that, once estab- 
lished, they required no imagi- 
nation or conjecture from any- 
one else in the place. He could 
talk: but he needn’t. They hardly 
saw him, which led them all to 
believe that he didn’t see them 
much either. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Well, all right,” said Chris. 
“I’ll just explain it to her and 
take her home and come right 
back.” 

“You can’t, you can’t,” she 
fretted. It was what she wanted 
him to do, but that disqualified 
it; she wouldn’t have that on her 
conscience. 

He shrugged and said, “Then 
what did you call me out here 
for?” The question was not rude, 
but a genuine request for infor- 
mation. 

“It’s a shame, that’s all,” she 
answered. She squeezed her 
hands together and looked at 
them unhappily. There seemed 
to be nothing else for him to say 
and certainly nothing he could 
do. He turned to go back to the 
dining room, but she said, “Why 
is she here so much, Chris?” 

“I don’t know, Mom. She — ” 
He made a vague gesture. He 
really didn’t know. Tess dropped 
around occasionally — hadn’t it 
been to visit Miz Binns, anyway 
at first? And since she was 
around so much, he talked to her. 

HPALKED about what? Again, 
he couldn’t recall clearly. 
Anything. Whatever was on his 
mind that could be talked about. 
His work — some of it; most of 
it couldn’t be expressed in words; 
it was conceptual, or technical, or 
mathematical, or all three. His 
feelings — some of them; most 



of them couldn’t be expressed in 
words, either; they were too con- 
ceptual, or unidentified, or oc- 
cluded, or all three. 

“We go to the movies some- 
times,” he said at length. And, 
“It’s nice sometimes to have 
somebody to talk to.” He said 
that, not “talk with.” He would 
have wondered why, but his 
mother interrupted his thinking 
the way people always did. 

“I know this is no time to dis- 
cuss it,” she said in that urgent 
whisper, “but what’s she want? 
I mean are you, do you, are you 
planning to, you know.” She fin- 
ished it like a statement, not a 
question. 

“I — never thought about it.” 

“You better. The way she 
acts.” 

“All right. But like you say, 
Mom, it’s not the time to think 
about it now.” The limited irri- 
tation was back again. He turned 
to the door which exploded in- 
ward and struck him a stinging 
blow on the right pelvis. 

“Now what’s going on in th’ 
black hole?” Billy roared. “You 
engineers precessin’ my gyros 
again?” 

“Tell Mom what you want to 
eat,” said Chris painfully. He 
walked stiffly back to the table 
and sat down. He rubbed his 
hip covertly. He didn’t look at 
Tess Milburn. He couldn’t. 

He picked at his food. She 



THE CLAUSTROPHILE 



117 



picked at her food. Mr. Magru- 
der, who drank tea with his 
meals, drank his tea. And all the 
while, voices came from the 
kitchen. Chris was acutely em- 
barrassed, but at the same time 
he was wondering about the fil- 
tering effect of the swinging door, 
because it passed Miz Binns’ high 
frequencies — the sibilants and 
the hiss of her stage whisper — 
and Billy’s lows, the woofs, the 
chest tones — all without trans- 
mitting a single intelligible syl- 
lable. But when Billy laughed, 
he understood it. He had heard 
that laugh before. 

Billy bumped the door and 
surged through without touching 
it again as it swung open and 
back. His mother caught it and 
held it open on her side and 
bleated, “No, Billy, no!” and Billy 
laughed again and said, “Don’t 
you worry your pretty little head 
about it, Mom. Billy fix.” Miz 
Binns stood in the doorway 
wringing her hands, then sighed 
and went back in to get Billy’s 
dinner. 

Billy plumped down at the 
table and passed Chris a wide 
wink. “Well, Tess,” he said ex- 
pansively. “So long since I’ve 
seen you. Grown a bit, filled out 
a bit. Hell around a bit too, I 
bet.” He ignored the silent drop 
of her jaw and the quick fright- 
ened smile that followed it. 
“You’ve been walled up in this 

118 



haymow too long, girl. A little 
hurry an’ noise will do you a 
world of good. How about you 
and me, we couple up right after 
chow and buzz this burg?” 

Stricken, she looked at Chris. 
Chris said, “Look, Billy, we — ” 

J UST then, Miz Binns came in 
with a plate heaped and 
steaming. Serving dishes on the 
table not good enough for little 
Billee, Chris thought bitterly, 
fold by now. 

“Mom, what do you know! 
Tess and I got a date for right 
away!” Billy announced. 

“Oh, now, Billy!" said Miz 
Binns in that he’s-naughty-but- 
he’s-so-sweet tone. “Your very 
first night and we haven’t had a 
chance to chat even, and you 
have so little time, and — ” 

“Mom,” said the cadet cheer- 
fully, “you and I, we have two 
solid weeks in the daytime to 
blow tubes and scavenge tanks 
to our hearts’ delight, in the day- 
time when all good slaves are 
out digging gold. I hate to de- 
prive you tonight, but gosh, Mom, 
don’t be stingy. Spread it around. 
It’s okay, isn’t it, Chris?” 

It’s okay, isn’t it, Chris? All 
his life, that special laugh and 
then this question. For a while, 
when he was nine and Billy was 
seven, he used to burst into tears 
when he heard that question. For 
a while before that and after- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ward, he had responded with a 
resounding “No!” And a little 
later on, he had reasoned, argued, 
or silently shaken his head. Noth- 
ing ever made any difference. 
Billy would watch him and smile 
happily through his countermeas- 
ure, no matter what, and when he 
was finished would go right ahead 
and take, or do, or not do what- 
ever the thing was that he 
wanted and Chris didn’t. He had 
outweighed Chris since he was 
four years old, outtalked him 
always. 

But this one time, this one 
lousy time, he wasn’t going to 
get away with it. 

Chris looked at his mother’s 
anxious face, at Tess with a spot 
of pink on each of her sallow 
cheeks, a shine in her eyes that 
he had never been able to put 
there. No, by God, no. 

He filled his lungs to say it 
out loud when the impossible 
happened. A hard hand closed 
on his left wrist, under the table. 
A voice spoke in his left ear: 
“Let him!” — soft but command- 
ing. He looked down at the hand, 
but it had already gone. He 
looked at the face to his left, 
and Mr. Magruder impassively 
poured more tea. No one else 
seemed to have seen or heard. 

It was Mr. Magruder, all right, 
with some knack of directional, 
perfectly controlled speech, two 
syllables formed and aimed from 



the side of the thin dry lips for 
Chris and Chris alone. It was 
unusual for the old man to say 
anything at all beyond “Pass the 
salt.” It was unprecedented for 
him to enter a conversation, ad- 
vise. 

Chris looked at Tess’s trou- 
bled, almost beseeching face, the 
pink, the shine. “You want to 
go?” 

S HE looked at Billy and back 
to him, and then dropped 
her eyes. Chris felt rather than 
saw the slight movement of Mr. 
Magruder’s foot against the floor. 
He did not touch Chris, but the 
movement was another syllable 
of command; there was no ques- 
tion in Chris’s mind about that. 
“Go ahead if you want to.” 

Mr. Magruder nodded, or sim- 
ply dropped his chin to watch 
his hands fold a napkin. Miz 
Binns said, “I still think you’re 
awful, Billy,” and did not quite 
add, “dear boy.” Tess Milburn 
giggled. 

Billy began to eat heartily, 
and what might have been a very 
strained silence indeed was can- 
celed before it could become a 
problem. 

The doorbell rang. 

“I’ll get it,” Chris said relieved- 
ly. He got up and turned to the 
open, screened doorway. 

It must be a trick of the light 
was the thought that flashed 



THE CLAUSTROPHIIE 



119 



through his mind, but there 
wasn’t time to pursue it. “Yes?” 
“I’m Gerda Stein. Mr. Magru- 
der — ” 

“Oh, it’s Miss Stein,” his moth- 
er called. “Come in, do come in.” 
It had been no trick of the 
light. Chris opened the screen 
door and stood back, speechless. 
He had known there were human 
beings like this. TV and the mov- 
ies were full of them. They smiled 
from magazines and book-jack- 
ets, crooned and called and sold 
coffee, crockery and cosmetics on 
the car radio. All these are the 
proper and established places 
for such creatures; they don’t, 
they just don’t stand breathtak- 
ingly under the porch light on 
warm summer evenings and then 
walk straight into your own fa- 
miliar house. 

Someone nudged him out of 
his daze — Miz Binns. “Dinner’s 
on, I can warm up something, 
and your room’s all, my son from 
the Space Academy just, no, this 
is Chris. Billy’s the — ” 

“How do you do, Chris,” said 
Gerda Stein. 

“Uh,” said Chris. He followed 
the girl and his mother through 
the foyer into the dining room. 

“You already know Mr. Ma- 
gruder and this, this is Billy.” 
Billy shot up out of his chair 
like one of the Base rockets, and 
again Mr. Magruder steadied his 
water glass. 

120 



“Well-1-1,” Billy breathed, a 
sound like the last descending 
tones of a mighty alert siren. 

Gerda Stein smiled at him and 
Chris could see him blink. “No,” 
she said in answer to something 
Miz Binns was saying, “I’ve had 
dinner.” 

Chris came around the table 
and found his eyes on Tess Mil- 
burn’s face. It was wistful. “And 
this is Tess Milburn,” he blurted. 
In that instant of empathy for 
the ignored girl, so shadowed by 
the great light cast by the new- 
comer, he fairly shouted. He 
looked like a fool and knew it. 

G ERDA STEIN smiled warm- 
ly and took Tess’s hand. 
Surprisingly, Tess smiled, too, 
and went on smiling after she 
had been released — a real smile, 
for once, substitute for nothing. 

Chris felt embarrassed to see 
it — a strange embarrassment, 
starting with the consciousness of 
how hot his ears were, then going 
through a lightning intuitive 
chain to the insight that he was 
embarrassed when he made 
someone happjr, and that it had 
been worth the effort of thought 
because it was so rare, and then 
the conclusion that anyone who 
made people happy so rarely 
couldn’t be worth much. Which 
led him, of course, to look at his 
younger brother. 

Billy had stopped chewing 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



when Gerda Stein came in and 
he had not swallowed. He seemed 
for these long seconds as preoc- 
cupied as Chris was most of the 
time, and the slight flick of his 
blue eyes from Tess’s face to 
Gerda Stein’s indicated the 
source of his deep perplexity. 
And suddenly Chris saw it, as if 
it had been imprinted across the 
golden tan of the cadet’s bland 
forehead in moving lights. 

If Billy now went on with his 
idea of a date with Tess, this vi- 
sion would be left here with 
Chris and Mom and Mr. Magru- 
der and — very soon now, Mr. 
Magruder and Mom would retire, 
and . 

On the other hand, Billy shared 
with his mother a deep reluctance 
to face anyone with “Beat it, I 
don’t need you around,” or any 
variation thereof. 

Chris sat down slowly before 
his cold dinner and waited. He 
felt some things which taught 
him a great deal. One of them 
was that it was good to be in- 
volved with Billy in a situation 
where Billy couldn’t win. If Billy 
backed out of the date, Chris 
would go; if not, not; and by this 
Chris learned that the date didn’t 
really matter to him. This was a 
great relief to him. His mother’s 
questions had disturbed him more 
than he had known until he felt 
the relief. 

Billy sighed through his nos- 



trils and finally swallowed his 
mouthful. “I’m backin’ off my 
gantry, girl,” he said to Tess, “so 
start the count-down.” 

Chris caught a quick puzzled 
flicker of expression on Gerda 
Stein’s face. Miz Binns said, “He 
always talks like that. He means 
he and Tess are going out. Space 
talk.” Chris thought she was go- 
ing to run and hug him, but with 
obvious effort she controlled her 
feelings and said to Miss Stein, 
“Well, come settle in the parlor 
until I can take you up to your 
room.” 

“Have fun, kids,” said Chris, 
and got up and followed into the 
parlor. 

In the foyer, he turned and 
glanced back. He met Mr. Ma- 
gruder’s penetrating gaze, a star- 
tling experience for one used to 
seeing only the man’s cheek or 
lowered eyelid. He wished he 
could get some message, some 
communication from it, but this 
time he couldn’t. He felt very 
strange, as. if he had been given 
absolute alternatives: chaos, or 
obedience to an orderly unknown. 
He knew he had chosen obedi- 
ence and he was inexpressibly 
excited. 

££ A LWAYS wanted a space- 

-**■ man in the family,” Miz 
Binns was saying proudly to 
Gerda Stein, “and Billy’s always 
wanted to be one, and now look.” 



THE CLAUSTROPHILE

From the couch, Gerda Stein 
said politely, “He seems to be 
doing very well.” 

“Well? Why, he’s in the top 
twentieth of his class, nobody 
ever did that before except one 
fellow that was an air marshal’s 
son, Billy’s born for it, that’s what 
he is, born for it.” 

Chris said, “He was running 
around in a space helmet when 
he was two years old.” 

At his voice, Gerda Stein 
turned and smiled at him. “Oh, 
hello.” 

“I declare I don’t know how I 
could’ve had two boys so differ- 
ent,” said Miz Binns. “Years, I 
just couldn’t guess what Chris 
here would wind up doing, he’s 
nicely settled down though, fix- 
ing adding machines.” 

“Computers,” Chris said mild- 
ly- 

“Really! That must be very 
interesting. I use a computer.” 

“What kind?” 

“KCI. It’s only a very simple 
little one.” 

“I know it. Mechanical binary. 
Clever little machine,” said Chris 
and, to his intense annoyance, 
found himself blushing again. 

“Oh, well, you have something 
in common,” said Miz Binns. “I’ll 
just scoot along upstairs and see 
that your room’s just right. You 
keep Miss Stein happy till I call, 
Chris.” 

“Don’t go to any — ” the girl 



began, but Miz Binns had flut- 
tered out 

Chris thought we have some- 
thing in common, have we? He 
was absolutely tongue-tied. Keep 
Miss Stein happy, hah! He flicked 
a glance at her and found with 
something like horror that she 
was watching him. He dropped 
his eyes, wet his lips, and sat 
tensely wishing somebody would 
say something. 

Billy said something. Leaving 
Tess standing in the foyer, he 
stepped into the parlor, winked 
at Gerda Stein and said to Chris, 
“I heard that last test-firing of 
yours, shipmate — ‘Have fun!’ 
Well, you have fun.” He looked 
at Gerda Stein with open admi- 
ration. “Just remember, brer 
pawn — first move don’t win the 
game; it’s only an advantage. 
You told me that yourself.” 

“Shucks,” Chris said inanely. 

“I’ll see you soon,” said Billy, 
stabbing a forefinger toward her. 

“Good night,” Gerda Stein said 
courteously. 

T) ILLY left the room, bellow- 
ing, “C’mon, Venus-bird, let’s 
go git depraved.” Tess Milburn 
squeaked, then tittered, and they 
went out. Miz Binns came down- 
stairs just then and stopped at 
the front door. 

“You Tess Milburn,” she called 
in what she apparently hoped 
was mock severity, “you don’t go 



122 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



keepin’ that boy up until all 
hours!” From the warm dark 
came Billy’s rich laughter. 

“That boy,” breathed Miz 
Binns, coming into the parlor, “I 
do declare, he’s a caution, come 
on upstairs now if you want to 
and see your room, Miss Stein. 
That your bags out there on the 
stoop? Chris, just nip out and 
get Miss Stein’s bags in like a 
good boy.” 

“All right, Mom.” He was glad 
to have something to do. He 
went out and found the bags, 
two of them, a large suitcase and 
what looked like an overnight 
case. The suitcase was no trou- 
ble, but the little one weighed 
perhaps fifty pounds and he 
grunted noisily when he lifted it. 

“Here,” called Miz Binns, 
Til—” 

“No!” he barked. “I can handle 
it.” Mom wouldn’t learn, couldn’t 
learn that a man might be hu- 
miliated in front of strangers. 

He lifted the bags abruptly, 
knowing just how Bill — how a 
fellow could walk, sing, surge 
them up to the landing, lift and 
surge again to the top, breathing 
easily. He took a step and swung, 
and got all tangled with the 
screen door, and banged the 
overnight case noisily against the 
jamb; his arms and back wouldn’t 
do the easy graceful thing his 
mind knew how to do with them. 
So he didn’t lift and swing, or 



breathe easily, but plodded and 
hauled, and came into the north 
bedroom blowing like a grampus. 
All in the worlfl he hoped for 
was that he wouldn’t catch Gerda 
Stein smiling. 

He caught Gerda Stein smil- 
ing. 

He put the bags down by the 
bed and went blindly back down 
the stairs. Mr. Magruder was just 
then pacing his leisurely way into 
the parlor, his newspaper under 
his arm, and Chris became pain- 
fully aware of how hard he was 
still breathing and how it must 
look. He controlled it and fled 
to the dining room. 

He stood against the table for 
a long moment, pulling himself 
together, and then, with his 
glazed eyes fixed on the dish of 
cold hominy grits, slid gratefully 
into the familiar aloneness of his 
conjectures.

went into a lower level, seeing

again to a lower level and the 
awareness all about him of the

silent forces of the capillary, the 
unreasonable logic of osmosis, the 
delicate compromise called men- 
iscus. 

Water, water, everywhere . 
in the table-legs and the cloth, 
water fleeing from the edges of 
a pool of gravy, flying to the 
pores of a soda-cracker, all the 
world sere and soggy, set, slushy, 
slippery and solid because of 
water. 

T^OWN in this level there were 
no pipestem arms nor un- 
ready tongues nor fumblings for 
complex behavior codes known 
reflexively to all the world but 
Christopher Binns, and he was 
comforted. 

“What you dreaming about, 
boy, I do declare!” 

He came up out of it and 
faced her. He felt much better. 
“I’ll give you a hand washing up, 
Mom.” 

“Now you don’t have to do 
any such of a thing, Chris. Go on 
into the parlor and chat with 
Mr. Magruder.” 

He chuckled at the thought 
and began to stack the dirty 
plates. His mother went into the 
kitchen to clear the sink, shaking 
her head. Her woeful expression, 
he divined, was only superficial, 
a habit, an attitude; he could 
sense the core excitement and 
delight with which Billy always 
filled her. 

124 



Billy can do no wrong; he syl- 
logized — 

Billy does everything well; 
THEREFORE: 

Billy does no wrong well. 

He carried the plates into the 
kitchen. 

“I’m going to bed, dear.” 

“Good night, Mom.” 

“Thanks for helping. Chris — ” 

“You’re not angry at Billy, are 
you, about Tess, I mean?” 

“Why should I be angry?” he 
asked. 

“Well, I’m glad, then.” She 
thought he had answered her. 
“He doesn’t mean it, you know 
that.” 

“Sure, Mom.” He wondered 
dispassionately how her remark 
could possibly be applied to the 
situation, and gave up. He won- 
dered also, with considerably 
more interest, how and why he 
had been aware that while he 
was in the kitchen, Gerda Stein 
had come down and re-entered 
the parlor and that Mr. Magru- 
der had gone up to bed. He won- 
dred also what use the informa- 
tion would be to him, he who had 
the Sadim touch. The Sadim 
touch was a recurrent whimsy 
with him; it was Midas spelled 
backward and signified that 
everything he touched, especially 
gold, turned to — “Shucks.” 

“What, dear?” 

“Nothing. Good night, Mom.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



TJALELY she kissed him and 
*- tiredly toiled up the stairs. 
He stood by the dining room ta- 
ble, looking at the cut glass su- 
gar-bowl, now turned out to pas- 
ture in its old age and holding 
two dozen teaspoons, handles 
down, looking like something a 
robot bride in a cartoon might 
carry for a bouquet. He scanned 
the orderly place-setting around 
the table, the clean inverted cups 
mouthing their saucers, each han- 
dle a precise sixty degrees off 
the line of the near table edge; 
the bread plates with the guar- 
anteed 14K 100% solid gold edg- 
ing absent from every convexity, 
wanly present in the concave. 

And he couldn’t lose himself 
in these things. Below the level 
of the things themselves, there 
was nowhere he could go. Some- 
thing had closed his usual ready 
road to elsewhere and he felt a 
strange panic. He was unused to 
being restrained in the here and 
now, except on company time. 

All right, then, he admitted. 

He walked slowly through the 
foyer and into the parlor. Gerda 
Stein sat on the couch. She wasn’t 
knitting, or reading, or doing any- 
thing. Just sitting quietly, as if 
she were waiting. What on Earth 
could she be waiting for? 

He looked for the right place 
to sit, a chair not too close (not 
because he was afraid of being 
“forward” but because he would 

THE CLAUSTROPHILE 



have absolutely no resources if 
she thought he was) and not too 
far away (because it was late 
and everyone was in bed and they 
would have to keep their voices 
low. In case they talked). 

“Here,” she said, and put her 
hand on the cushion beside her. 

In his own house, he said, 
“Thank you, thank you very 
much,” and sat down. When the 
silence got to be too much for 
him, he faced her. She looked 
back gravely and he turned again 
and stared at the print of the 
sentinel at Pompeii which had 
hung there since before he was 
born. 

‘What are you thinking?” 
You’re the most beautiful 
thing I’ve ever seen. But he said, 
“You comfortable?” He consid- 
ered his statement, hanging there 
untouched in the room, and add- 
ed with something like hysteria, 
“In your room, I mean.” 

She shrugged. It conveyed a 
great deal. It was, “Quite what I 
expected,” and “There’s certainly 
nothing to complain about,” and 
“What can it possibly matter?” 
and, more than anything else, “I 
won’t be here long enough to 
have any feelings about it one 
way or the other.” 

A NY of these things, spoken 
aloud by anyone else, would 
have made him wildly defensive, 
for all he may not have been 

ir.s 



able to express it. Spoken by her, 
perhaps it would be different. 
He couldn’t know. But transmit- 
ted thus mutely — he had noth- 
ing to say. He put his hands to- 
gether between his knees and 
squeezed, miserable and excited. 

“Why did your brother go to 
the Space Academy?” she asked. 

“Congressman Shellfield got 
him the appointment.” 

“I didn’t mean that.” 

“Oh,” he said, “you mean why.” 
He looked at her and again had 
to look away. “He wanted to, I 
guess. He always wanted to.” 
“You can’t always want to do 
anything,” she said gently. ‘When 
did it start?” 

“Gosh ... I dunno. Years back. 
When we were kids.” 

“What about you?” 

“Me?” He gave a short, un- 
certain laugh. “I can’t remember 
wanting anything specially. Mom 
says — •” 

"I wonder where he ever got 
the idea,” she mused. 

He guessed she had been 
thinking about Billy up in her 
room and had come down to find 
out more about him, had sat here 
waiting until he could come and 
tell her more. He made a sad, 
unconscious little gesture with 
his hands. Then he remembered 
that she had -asked a question. 
When he didn’t answer questions, 
why did she just wait like that? 
‘We used to play spaceman 

126 



before Billy could talk,” he re- 
called. He glanced her way and 
laughed surprisedly. “I’d forgot- 
ten all about that. I really had.” 
“What kind of games?” 
“Games, you know. Rocket to 
the Moon and all. I was the cap- 
tain and he was the crew. Well, 
at first I was the ... I forget. Or 
I was the extraterrestrial and he 
was the explorer. Games.” He 
shrugged. “I remember the take- 
offs. We’d spread out on the 
couch and scream when the ac- 
celeration pressed the air out of 
our lungs. Mom didn’t much like 
that screaming.” 

She laughed. “I can imagine. 
Tell me, do all spacemen talk 
the way he does?” 

“You mean that ‘shipmate’ and 
‘gantry’ and ‘hit the blockhouse’?” 
He paused for such a long 
time that she asked quietly, 
“Don’t you want to tell me?” 

TTE STARTED. “Oh, sure, 
sure. I had to think. Last 
year, Easter vacation, he brought 
another cadet with him, name of 
Davies. Nice fellow, quiet, real 
black hair, sort of stoop-shoul- 
dered. I’d heard Billy talking 
that way before, thought it was 
the way to talk. But when I used 
it on Davies, he’d just look at 
me — ” unconsciously, Chris was 
mimicking the wonderstruck Da- 
vies — “as if I was crazy. Harm- 
less, but crazy.” He gave his soft, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



embarrassed chuckle. “I guess I 
didn’t do it right. I guess there’s 
just exactly a right way of say- 
ing those things. You have to be 
a cadet to do it.” 

“Oh? Do all the cadets talk 
that way?” 

“Davies didn’t. Not to us, any- 
way. I never met any others.” 
“Maybe Billy’s the only one 
who talks that way.” 

Chris had never considered the 
possibility. “That would sure 
sound funny at the Academy.” 
“Not if he never did it there.” 
Chris made a sudden awkward 
movement of the head, trying to 
brush away the idea. Stubbornly, 
it wouldn’t brush. It was, after 
all, the first hypothesis his kind 
of logic had been able to accept 
for Cadet Davies’ odd reactions. 
In itself, this was welcome, but 
it opened up an area of thinking 
about his brother he disliked to 
indulge in. 

He said as much: “I wouldn’t 
like to think of Billy that way, 
talking like — like when we were 
seven, eight years old.” 

“Why not? How do you like 
to think of Billy?” 

“He’s — getting what he wants. 
Going where he wants to go. He 
always has.” 

“Instead of you?” 

“I don’t know what you mean.” 
Or, he added silently, why you 
ask or why you want to know 
any of this. He shifted his feet 



and turned to meet that discon- 
certing, warm, open, un jeering 
smile. “What do you want me to 
say?” he demanded, with a trace 
of irritation. 

She settled back slightly. He 
knew why; she was going to wait 
again. He wouldn’t be able to 
cope with that, he knew, so he 
said quickly, “It’s all right for 
Billy to be that way. He can do 
things I — other people can’t do. 
I’m not mad about that, not mad 
at him. There’s nothing to be 
mad at. It would be like — being 
mad at a bird because it had 
wings. He’s just different.” 

He realized that he had wan- 
dered from the area of her ques- 
tion, so he stopped, thought back, 
located it. Billy gets what he 
wants — instead of you. 

He began again: “It’s all right 
for Billy to get what he wants, 
even if it’s something I happen 
to want, too, and don’t get . 
How can I explain it?” 

T> ISING suddenly, he began 
pacing, always turning away 
from her, passing her with his 
eyes downcast. It was as if the 
sight of her chained him, and 
with his eyes averted, he could 
run with his own thoughts again. 

“It’s as if Billy wasn’t some- 
thing separate at all, but just 
another side of me. Part of me 
wants to go to the Academy — 
Billy goes. Part of me wants to 



THE CLAUSTROPHILE 



127 



go out with Tess, not just to the 
movies, but out with her, make 
her feel — you know. Well, Billy 
does it. Or talk like Billy, look 
like him, all that racket and fast 
gab.” He laughed, almost fondly. 
He sounded, then, just like his 
mother. “Sometimes he’s a nui- 
sance, but mostly I don’t care. 
There’s other things, lots of them, 
that I do that Billy couldn’t. 
There’s another part of me that 
does those things.” 

He allowed himself another 
quick look at Gerda Stein. She 
had turned to follow his pacings. 
He was in the far corner of the 
room and she sat with her cheek 
on her bare forearm, her head 
inclined as on a pillow and her 
hair hung down over the arm of 
the couch, heavy and bright. 

“What things?” she asked. 

He came back then and sat 
down beside her. “It’s hard to 
say. It’s very hard to say.” 

He sat for a long time per- 
forming the totally unprecedent- 
ed task of verbalizing what he 
had never given words to before, 
the thoughts and feelings, ideas 
and intuitions so intimately, so 
mutely his own; all the things 
he set aside when he talked to 
Tess, all the things which occu- 
pied and preoccupied him during 
that ninety per cent of his life 
when he must commune and 
could not communicate. He sat 
there striving with it while she 

128 



waited. Her waiting was no long- 
er a trial to him. He realized 
that, but would not think about 
it. Yet. 

“The nearest I can get to it,” 
he said when he was ready, “is 
this: I’ve found out something 
that’s at the root of everything 
anyone can think about, some- 
thing that all thinking gets to 
sooner or later, and starts from, 
too. One simple sentence . 
Now wait.” He put his simple 
sentence in front of his mind and 
looked at it for a long studious 
time. Then he spoke it. “Nothing 
is always absolutely so.” 

He turned to her. She nodded 
encouragingly but did not speak. 

“It’s a — help. A big help,” he 
said. “I don’t know when I first 
found it out. A long time back, 
I suppose. It helps with people. I 
mean the whole world is built 
on ideas that people say are so, 
and about all the troubles people 
have are caused by finding out 
that one thing or another around 
them just' isn’t so. Or it isn’t so 
any longer. Or it’s almost so, but 
not absolutely.” 

/^kN receipt of another encour- 
” aging nod from Gerda Stein, 
“Nothing is always absolutely so,” 
he said again. “Once you know 
that, know it for sure, you can 
do things, go places you never 
thought about before. Everything 
there is gives you some place to 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



go, something to think about. Ev- 
erything. Take a — a brass rivet, 
say. It’s brass; you start with that. 
And what’s brass? An alloy. How 
much change of what metal 
would make it not be brass? Giv- 
en enough time, would radioactive 
decay in one of the metals trans- 
mute it enough so it wouldn’t be 
brass any more? 

“Or take the size. How big is 
it? Well, doesn’t that depend? 
It’s smaller after it’s been used 
than when it was new. What color 
is it? That depends, too. In other 
words, if you’re going to describe 
to me exactly what that rivet is, 
you’re going to have to qualify 
and modify and get up a list of 
specs half as long as a tide chart 
and half as wide as Bowditch. 
And then all I have to do is 
sweat one drop of sweat on that 
rivet and wait twenty-four hours 
and you’ll have to revise your 
specs. 

“Or drop down a level. Pass 
a current through my rivet. The 
copper has this resistance and 
the zinc has another and a trace 
of iron has still more. What’s the 
velocity of electromagnetic force 
through all this mess, and what 
kind of arguments do the atoms 
have about it? Or use a strong 
magnetic field. Why — really why, 
aside from ‘It just happens’ — is 
the copper so shy magnetically 
in brass and so out-and-out fer- 
rous in alnico?” 



He stopped to breathe. He 
breathed hard. It recalled to him 
how she had smiled when he had 
puffed into her room with the 
bags. 

He realized suddenly that he 
had been altogether wrong in 
his estimate of that smile. He 
had feared it because he was 
ready to fear any smile. Now he 
knew that it was not just any 
smile, but the one he saw now 
— warm, encouraging, much like 
the smile which Tess Milburn 
had found and kept. 

“What I’m driving at is, with 
this idea, that nothing is always 
absolutely so. You don’t really 
need people or anything about 
them — movies, TV, talk; any- 
way, not for hours at a time, 
days. You don’t have to hate 
people; I don’t mean that at all. 
It’s just that people’s worries 
don’t matter so much. People’s 
troubles you can answer every 
time by saying ‘Nothing is al- 
ways absolutely so,’ and go on 
to something else. 

“But when you see that the wet 
half of a towel is darker than 
the dry half, or hear the sound 
of a falling bomb descending 
when all reason says it ought to 
rise in pitch, and you know where 
you’re going to start: Why? and 
where you’ll wind up: Nothing 
is always absolutely so, and chal- 
lenge yourself to find the logic 
between start and finish — why, 



THE CLAUSTROPHILE

then you have your hands full; 
then you have a place to go.” 

SN’T that a sort of escape?” 
the girl asked quietly. 

“Depends on where you’re 
standing at the time. Mixing 
yourself up with human problems 
is maybe escaping from these 
other things. Anyway, these other 
things are human problems.” 

“Are they?” 

“E=MC- turned out to be. 
First it had to be thought out, 
with the thinking all the reward 
in sight, and after that it had to 
be applied, but don’t tell me it 
isn’t a human problem! Some- 
one, for instance, had to put pine- 
apple rings on a ham before bak- 
ing, for the very first time! Or 
eat a raw oyster. That seems to 
me to be the kind of thinking I’m 
talking about.” He brought his 
hand down for emphasis on the 
arm of the couch; it fell right 
on hers. “That’s why Billy’s at 
the Academy, because someone, 
and then some people, and then 
mankind began to want space.” 

She curled her fingers around 
his hand, not quite clasping it, 
and looked down contempla- 
tively. “A good hand,” she said 
in an impersonal voice, and gave 
it back to him. 

“Huh? It’s crummy — solder 
burns, ground-in bench dirt . .” 
He held it as if it no longer com- 
pletely belonged to him. And it

doesn’t, he thought with a start. 

“Tell me,” she asked lazily, “is 
the Academy’s way the right way 
to get to space?” 

“The only way,” he said posi- 
tively, and then, because his rea- 
son caught up with his honesty, 
he amended, “that’s being tried.” 

Suddenly she sat up straight, 
leaned forward. She tossed her 
hair back as she turned toward 
him, with a gesture he knew he’d 
never forget. 

She said, “I wonder about that. 
I wonder about fine-tuning men 
physically until they’re all mus- 
cle and bounce, just to coop them 
up in a cabin for months on end. 
I wonder about all the training 
in astrogation when even primi- 
tive computers can do better, and 
no training at all in conversation, 
which we don’t have a machine 
for yet. I wonder at the thinking 
behind hundred per cent male 
complements on those ships. I 
wonder about 10G stress tests on 
men who will have to develop an 
inertialess drive before they can 
think about real space travel. But 
most of all, I wonder — I worry 
— about putting extraverts on 
spacecraft.” 

She settled back again, look- 
ing at him quizzically. 

“All right,” he said, “I can play 
that game. Suppose I took every 
one of those wonderments of 
yours and turned them over to 
look at the other side. What 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



would you do instead — man 
your ships with soft-bellied book- 
worms with no reflexes? Train 
them in philosophy and repartee 
in an eighteenth-century salon? 
Teach them to rely on their com- 
puters and never know what the 
machines are doing? Put women 
on the ships for them to get jeal- 
ous about and fight over? Lay in 
a pack of brooding introverts, 
neuroses and all?” 

“Neuroses,” she repeated. “I’m 
glad you mentioned them. I im- 
agine you’re pretty sure that hu- 
manity is by and large a pretty 
neurotic species.” 

“Well, if your definition — ” 
“Never mind the specs,” she 
said, interrupting him. 

f I ''HERE was a new, concise 
ring to her voice that affected 
him much as had the first sight 
of her, standing out there under 
the porch light. Breathless, he 
fell silent. 

“Yes, humans are neurotic,” 
she answered her own question. 
“Insecure, disoriented, dissatis- 
fied, fearful, full of aggressions 
against their own kind, always 
expecting attack, always afraid 
of being misunderstood, always 
in conflict between the urge to 
fly like a bird and the urge to 
burrow like a mole. Now why 
should all this be?” 

He simply shook his head, be- 
wildered. 



“You have a very special mind, 
Chris, with your hypotheses and 
your lower levels and your quar- 
reling atoms. Can you take a 
really big hypothesis?” 

“I can try.” 

“Hypothesis:” she said, making 
it sound like a story title. ‘There 
is a space-traveling species that 
achieved space flight in the first 
place because, of all species, it 
was the most fit. It established a 
commerce throughout a system, 
systems of systems, a galaxy, an- 
other. It had an inertialess faster- 
than-light drive, a suspended 
animation technique, sub-etheric 
communications — why go on 
listing all its achievements? Just 
say it was technologically gifted 
and its gift was only one facet of 
the whole huge fact that it was 
born and bred for space travel. 

“Now, expanding as it must, it 
spread itself thin. It compensated 
as well as it could by learning to 
breed fast, by reducing to the 
minimum the size of its crews 
and increasing the efficiency of 
its ships. But each of these .expe- 
dients only increased the spread; 
there’s an awful lot of business 
in this universe for the sole qual- 
ified species. 

“The only way out was to lo- 
cate planets similar to their own 
home world and seed them with 
people. That way, crews could be 
formed from one end of the ex- 
plored universe to the other. The 



THE CLAUSTROPHILE 



131 




best way to do this would be to 
put down large colonial ships on 
suitable planets, complete with 
everything they might need to 
raise six or seven generations 
while acclimating to the planet. 
Thereafter, the colonies could be 
self-sustaining. That’s the overall 
pic — uh — hypothesis. Are you 
still with me?” 

“N-no,” said Chris dazedly, 
“but go on.” 

She laughed. “Now suppose one 
of these big colonial vessels had 
some trouble — an impossible 
series of unlikely happenings 
that threw it out of control, while 
in faster-than-light flight with the 



personnel in suspended animation 
and all automatic orientation 
gear washed out. Centuries go by. 
If it encounters a galaxy, it will 
search out the right kind of plan- 
et, but it doesn’t encounter any- 
thing until — ” 

Her voice died down. Chris 
looked at her, bent closer. Her 
eyes were closed and she was 
breathing very slowly, very 
deeply. As if she sensed him near 
her, she opened her eyes sud- 
denly and gave a queer twisted 
smile. 

“Sorry,” she murmured, and 
took his hand so he would not 
move away. “This is the part I 



132 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



— don’t like to think about, even 
— hypothetically.” 

T^OR a moment, all the senses 
in Chris’s body seemed to 
concentrate and flow together, to 
lie ecstatic in the hollow of her 
hand. Then she began to speak 
again. 

“The ship was old, old by 
then, and the machinery badly 
butched. It found a galaxy all 



right, and, in time, a planet. It 
snapped into normal space; it 
started the gestators . .” 

“Gestators?” he echoed blank- 
ly- 

“Artificial placentae. Easier to 
carry fertilized ova and nutrients 
than children or even parents. 
But the revitalizers, for the sus- 
pendees — they failed, about 
ninety-eight per cent of them.” 
She sighed. It was a mourning

sound. “No one knows what hap- 
pened, not all of it. No one . 
should. The ship wasn’t designed 
to make planetfall; it was an 
orbital, true-space vessel. They 
landed it, somehow, the few that 
were left. The crash took more 
lives — most, perhaps. The scout 
ships, the ferries, neatly stacked 
in the gimbal locks — all wrecked. 
Stores, books — call them books, 
it’s simpler — everything lost. 
And all that was left, all that 
lived ... a couple of hundred 
babies, helpless, hungry, many 
hurt, and a handful of maimed 
adolescents to care for them. 

“The ship didn’t last long; it 
wasn’t built to take what a cor- 
rosive oxygen atmosphere could 
do to it. The boats hadn’t been 
coated and they went, too, in 
weeks. 

“But this is a hardy breed. 
Most died, but not all. Perhaps, 
to some, this would be a fascinat- 
ing study in the old heredity- 
environment haggle; personally, 
I wouldn’t have the stomach for 
it. They lost their language, their 
culture, their traditions and age- 
old skills. But they kept their 
genes. And in time, two prime 
characteristics showed through 
their savagery, come straight 
from their heritage: They bred 
fantastically and they reached 
for the stars. 

“Unlike any other civilized 
species, they would breed beyond 



the ability of the land to support 
them, breed until they had to 
kill one another to survive at all 
— a faculty developed through 
eons of limitless lehbensraum, 
but a deadly quality for a planet- 
bound race. It decimated them 
and they outbred even their own 
deadliness, so that in a brief time 
— twenty, twenty-two thousand 
years — they went from the doz- 
ens to the billions, threatening 
to carpet the planet with their 
bodies. Meanwhile the suicidal 
other-worldly urge to breed col- 
ored their mores and their liter- 
ature until it stood unique among 
the galactic cultures. 

“But they reached for the 
stars. They excused their hunger 
for the stars in a thousand ways, 
and when they grew too rational 
for excuses, they made no more 
and still went starward. 

“And now, today, they are on 
the verge of it, by themselves, 
struggling along in their own ter- 
rified, terrifying way, ignorant of 
their origins, mystified by the 
drive in their blood . yes, Chris, 
a. neurotic people.” 

A FTER a time, Chris said, 
“How did you — uh — where 
did you hear — uh — read this . 

She laughed and looked down 
again at his hand. She patted it 
with her free one and then held 
it for a moment in both. “Hy- 
pothesis, remember?”

He shuddered, the late, large 
impact of her vivid voice and 
the pictures it evoked. It was 
somehow a delightful sensation. 

“Will . did they ever find 
their own people?” 

“They were found. Contact 
was made — oh, four hundred 
years ago.” 

C HRIS exhaled explosively. 

“Then it isn’t — ” He looked 
closely at her face. Even now, he 
was afraid of what her laughter 
might be like. “ . Earth?” he 
finished in a small voice. 

“Isn’t it?” 

“Four hundred years . every- 
body would know.” 

She shook her head soberly. 
“Consider : twenty thousand years 
of genetic drift, mutation, condi- 
tioning. The old drives may be 
there — statistically, and in the 
majority. But figure it out for 
yourself — what are the chances 
of a prototypical spaceman after 
all that time? You’d find most of 
the desirable characteristics in 
some, some in most. You’d find 
all of them as a statistic, in a 
numerical sample. But if you 
were a captain looking for a 
crew, how would you find the 
man you wanted?” 

“You already described the 
spacebound neurotic.” 

“It can’t be just any neurotic, 
only because he’s neurotic! He 
has to be a very special — very 

136 



specialized neurotic indeed. 
They’re rare.” 

“Then you’d have to announce 
yourself, advertise for what you 
wanted, have screenings, a train- 
ing program — ” 

“Don’t you know what would 
happen if all the world found 
out about the spaceman?” 

“There’d be a riot, I guess — 
everyone wanting to go.” 

“There’d be a riot, all right,” 
she said sadly, “but not that 
kind. There’s one thing mankind 
is afraid of, sight unseen. It’s a 
fear born of his slow growth on 
a strange and hostile planet, with 
only his brains as weapons and 
shelter.” 

“One fear—” 

“The alien. Xenophobia — vir- 
tually a racial disease. All through 
your history, you have it, and it’s 
always there under the surface, 
waiting to break out again like 
an ugly fire. There would be an 
attack on the spacemen them- 
selves, and then a witch-hunt the 
like of which even this planet has 
never seen before. First the ones 
who fully qualify as spacemen, 
though they were born here; 
next, anyone who has some of 
spaceman’s characteristics — and 
everyone has!” 

“I don’t believe it!” Chris pro- 
tested hotly. “I don’t think human 
beings would go that far, be that 
stupid!” 

“Humanity lets itself live on 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



bare sufferance as it is,” Gerda 
Stein said sorrowfully. “No, pub- 
licity isn’t the answer.” 

“Then what’s been going on 
these four hundred years?” 

S HE said, “Surveys. Spaceman 
still desperately needs re- 
cruits, especially in this galaxy, 
which is new, unexplored, prac- 
tically. So spacemen come here, 
live among you, and every once 
in a while a candidate is spotted. 
He’s observed for — well, long 
enough to determine if he’s the 
right kind.” 

“What’s the right kind?” he 
asked. 

“You gave a pretty good de- 
scription yourself a while ago.” 
“The introspective neurotic?” 
“With special mechanical and 
computing skills, and an inner 
resource that needs no books or 
teleplays or joy-riding or deprav- 
ity to keep from being bored.” 
“And what happens when 
someone like that turns up?” 
“The — agent reports, and 
after a while the space captain 
shows up. If the candidate is 
willing, he goes. He disappears 
from Earth and just goes.” 

“He has to be willing.” 

“Of course! What good would 
he be if he was shanghaied?” 
“Well,” said Chris primly, 
“that’s something, anyway.” 

She did laugh at him, after all. 
It didn’t hurt. While she was 



laughing, he was so disarmed that 
he asked her a question. He 
hadn’t meant to; it just slipped 
out. 

“Why did you want to know 
all those things about Billy?” 
“Don’t you have any idea?” 
He looked at his hands. He 
said, a little sullenly, “You seem 
to think Billy never started any- 
thing by himself. You don’t seem 
to think he can. You — well, I got 
the idea you think he gets pushed 
into things.” He turned to her 
briefly. “By me, for Pete’s sake!” 
“And you don’t think so?” 

He gave a snort, embarrassed 
and negative. “If I could believe 
that, I — I could believe every- 
thing else you’ve been saying.” 
She smiled a very special 
smile. “Why don’t you try it, 
then, and find out who’s right?” 
Quietly, for a long time, he 
thought. 

“I will,” he whispered at last. 
“I will.” He straightened and 
looked at her. “Gerda, where do 
you come from?” 

She rose and, spectacularly, 
stretched. “A little place called 
Port Elizabeth,” she said. “Not 
very far from here. Port Eliza- 
beth, New Jersey.” 

“Oh.” 

She laughed at him again and 
took his hand. “Good night, Chris. 
Can we talk some more about 
this?” 

He shook his head. “Not until 



THE CLAUSTROPHILE 



137 



I really — really think about it.” 
“You will.” 

H E WATCHED her cross the 
foyer to the stairs. She put 
one hand on the newel post and 
waved to him, crinkling her eye- 
lids in a way he would find as 
unforgettable as that turn and 
sweep and uncovering when she 
threw back her hair to face him. 
He found himself quite incapable 
of a wave or anything else. 

For a long time after he heard 
her door close, he stood in the 
parlor looking at the stairs. At 
last he shook himself, turned out 
the lights in the parlor and all 
but the night lamp in the foyer. 
He turned on the porch light for 
Billy and went upstairs to the 
room they shared. 

He undressed slowly and ab- 
sent-mindedly, looking around his 
room as if he had never seen it. 

The orrery which he had 
started to build when he was ten, 
and which Billy had taken away 
from him and finished, all except 
the painting, which he did after 
all because Billy grew tired of it. 

The charts of the Solar System 
from the celestial north (over 
Billy’s bed) and from the south 
(over his). The Smithsonian 
photo-map of the Moon, carefully 
pasted to the ceiling, which Billy 
had moved to another spot, ap- 
parently because he hadn’t been 
consulted, so Chris had had to 

138 



plaster up the first spot. The 
spaceships and Billy’s toy space 
helmet. (Hadn’t it been Chris’s, 
for his twelfth birthday? But 
somehow “your” helmet had be- 
come “our” helmet and then 
“mine.”) Anyway, it was all space 
stuff, everything in sight, and 
space meant Billy, so somehow 
it was all Billy. And Billy not 
back long enough even to open 
his bag. 

Chris got the pattern sudden- 
ly, but very late. Years late. He 
lay back on his bed and grinned, 
then got up and switched on the 
light over the desk. He went into 
the lavatory and got a big cake 
of white soap and spread news- 
paper on the desk and went to 
work on the soap with a pocket- 
knife, carving a cat’s head. 

13 ILLY came in about two, 
-*-* clumping heavily, yawning 
noisily on the stairs. He banged 
into the room and kicked the 
door closed. 

“Now you didn’t have to wait 
up, shipmate,” he said facetiously. 

“I wasn’t.” Chris got up from 
the desk, put the knife down, 
and crossed to his bed. 

Billy flung off his cape and 
tossed it on the easy-chair. “Well, 
I tilted that chick clean off the 
orbit, shipmate. You can take 
down your meteor screens. She 
won’t be dustin’ around you no 
more.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Why do me a favor like 
that?” Chris asked tiredly. 

“You and Mom, you mean,” 
said Billy, shucking out of his 
space boots. “You hadn’ oughta 
worry Mom like that.” 

“Like what?” 

“She computed you an’ li’l 
Heartburn on a collision orbit. 

* Well, Billy fix. She’ll have nothin’ 
in her viewplates from now on 
but Space Academy blue.” He 
went to his cape and arranged it 
carefully on the chair-back. “It’s 
not me, y’unnerstan’, shipmate, 
not me pers’nal. It’s just no one 
man can compete against the 
Space Corps. Not on a Venus 
sighting anyway,” he said with 
labored modesty. Chris could see 
his mind wandering away from 
the subject before he had gotten 
the whole sentence out. “How’d 
you make out?” 

“Make out? Oh — Miss Stein.” 
“Oh — Miss Stein. Fair warn- 
ing, shipmate — that there’s Tar- 
get the Next.” 

C HRIS lay back and closed his 
eyes. 

“You ever satisfied?” 

“Look, shipmate,” Billy said 
over his shoulder, “ ‘satisfied’ 
didn’t come inboard yet. These 
things I play straight and square, 
gyros on the ship’s long axis and 
a-pointin’ down the main tube. 
• So get the brief, mudbound: to- 
night’s mission was for you and 



for Mom. Tomorrow’s for me. 
Over.” He banged open his kit 
and pulled out a pajama zip-on. 
It was then that the carved bar 
of soap caught his eye. “What 
you riggin’, shipmate?” 

“Nothing,” said Chris, as tired, 
ly before, but watching like a 
lynx. 

“Sculptin’ soap. I heard of it. 
Often wondered.” He bent over 
the work and, suddenly, laughed. 
That laugh. “Hey, high time we 
got a new hobby. This ain’t bad 
for a beginner.” He rocked the 
desk lamp back and forth to get 
shadows. “Think I’ll square it 
away a bit for you. It’s okay, 
isn’t it, Chris?” 

“I was going to fin — ” 

“That’s all right, don’t let it 
worry you. You won’t know I 
touched it.” He had stopped lis- 
tening to Chris while Chris 
spoke, stopped listening to him- 
self before he himself finished. 
He leaned over and flicked the 
carving with the point of the 
knife, then again. He bent closer, 
considering. Abruptly he sat 
down, got his elbows solidly 
planted on the desk, pulled the 
light closer and went to work. 

Behind him, Chris nodded 
once, then smiled himself into 
his thoughts, level on lower level 
— the very first being the knowl- 
edge of who did start (and usu- 
ally complete) things — until 
he slept. 



THE CLAUSTROPHILE 



139 



I T WAS Mr. Magruder’s habit 
to take no breakfast at home, 
but to mount his stately and lu- 
dicrous old three-tone 1958 Buick 
and drive into town, where he 
would have tea sent up to the 
office. He did these things at 
such an unbearably early hour 
that his tacit offer of transporta- 
tion to any who wanted it was 
almost always refused. 

But this was an exception. Miz 
Binns greeted the change with 
polite protests but inner satisfac- 
tion; Billy was sleeping late, hav- 
ing been doing something up in 
the room until all hours, and now 
she would be able to take her 
time and compose a really fabu- 
lous tray for him. And Chris, 
looking uncharacteristically bright 
and cheerful for that hour, held 
Gerda Stein’s elbow for her as 
she negotiated the front steps, 
and opened the ancient Buick’s 
chrome-slashed door for her. 

As soon as they were away 
from the curb, Chris took a deep 
breath and said, “I’m sure you 
won’t be needing Miss Stein to- 
day at all, Mr. Magruder.” 

The old man said nothing and 
did nothing but continue to drive 
at his less-than-lawful and unde- 
viating rate. 

Gerda Stein turned expression- 
less and watchful eyes to Chris’s 
face. Nobody said anything for 
a two-block interval. 

“Also,” said Chris firmly, “I’d 



appreciate it if you’d have some- 
one in your office call my plant 
around 9:15 and tell them I won’t 
be in today. I could do it myself, 
but I want it off my mind right 
now.” 

Mr. Magruder took his foot 
off the accelerator and let the 
car glide to a stop at the curb 
before applying the brakes. It ' 
took a long silent time. Chris 
opened the door and handed 
Gerda Stein out. He shut the t 
door. “Thank you, Mr. Magru- 
der.” 

As soon as the car was out of 
sight, Chris Binns began to laugh 
like a fool. Gerda Stein held on 
to him, or sturdily held him up, 
and after a time laughed, too. 

“What was that for?” she 
asked when she could. 

Chris wiped his eyes. “Damn 
if I know. Too much of . too 
much all at once, I guess.” Im- 
pulsively he reached out and ran 
his hand gently from her temple 
to the hinge of her jaw, not quite 
cupping her chin. 

She held quite still while he 
did this, and when he dropped 
his hand, she said, “Well, hello.” 

He wished he had something 
like it to say, but after two trials 
all he could utter was, “B-break- 
fast,” so they laughed together 
again and strode off, Chris hold- 
ing her hand tight to the inside of 
his elbow. She walked well with " 
him, long steady paces. “Can you 



140 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



dance in a spaceship?” he asked. 

“With slow rolls,” she twinkled. 

They had wafflles with cherry 
syrup and the best coffee in the 
world. He watched his thoughts 
and smiled, and she watched his 
face. When they had finished and 
fresh coffee arrived, he said, 
“Now, questions.” 

“Go ahead.” 

“You say the colony ship was 
wrecked here about twenty-five 
thousand years ago. How do you 
account for Swanscombe and Pe- 
kin and Australopithecus and 
all?” 

“They’re indigenous.” 

S HE touched his hand for em- 
phasis. “Chris, if you’ll think 
on galactic terms, or larger, you’ll 
be quite satisfied. When one of 
those seeking mechanisms is set 
for a planet of this type, it isn’t 
satisfied with an almost. And in 
multigalactic terms, there’s plen- 
ty of choice. Homo sap, or some- 
thing very like him, grows on 
many of those planets, if not 
most. In Earth’s case, they may 
even have interbred. We’re not 
sure, but there have been cases. 
Whether or not, though, Space- 
man’s presence here was no boon 
to the other races. He’s a pretty 
■rtice fellow in his own element, 
but he makes for a fairly critical 
mass when you let him pile up.” 
“All right. Now a little more 
about this neurosis business. Why 



should Spaceman be so out of 
kilter on a planet? I’d think of 
him as pretty adaptable.” 

“He certainly is! He survived 
for twenty-five thousand years 
here, didn’t he? But about these 
neuroses — they’re easy enough 
to account for, once you under- 
stand the basic drives. Look: 

“One characteristic that has 
been the subject of more worry, 
more sneers, more bad jokes than 
anything else here — except sex 
itself — is the back-to-the-womb 
movement. Introspection and in- 
troversion and agorophobia and 
heaven knows what else, from 
the ridiculous — like the man 
who can’t work in an office where 
he can’t have his back to the 
wall — to the sublime — like 
the Nirvana concept — is traced 
to a desire for the womb — the 
enclosed, sustaining, virtually 
gravityless womb. As soon as you 
discover that the womb itself is 
only a symbol for this other heri- 
tage, what explanation do you 
need instead?” 

“Bedamned,” whispered Chris. 

“Another almost universal in- 
ner tension has to do with peo- 
ple, though some of us compen- 
sate admirably. What’s the most 
ideal state for most people? The 
family — the enclosed, familiar, 
mutually responsive family unit. 
Only strangers cause communica- 
tion to break down; only outsid- 
ers are unpredictable. Hence our

cultural insanities — as I told 
you before, xenophobia, the fear 
of the foreigner. Spaceman trav- 
els in sexually balanced small- 
family units, the young getting 
their own ships and their own 
mates as the ships meet and 
cross the Universe over.” 

“Bedamned again,” said Chris. 

“Now your ideal spaceman: 
He’d have to be a neurotic on 
Earth, just as — if you can imag- 
ine it — a person brought up from 
birth to walk nothing but tight 
wires would be neurotic on solid 
ground. He’d wear himself out 
with unnecessary compensatory 
reflexes. Your true spaceman 
wants knowledge, not pastimes. 
His reaction to outside pressures 
is to retreat into his own re- 
sources — first, his ship (like 
you in your job); next, his own 
thoughts and where they might 
lead him (like you on your own 
time). And he wants a — ” 

HRIS looked up into her 
eyes. 

He said gently, “Go on.” 

“He wants, not women, but a 
mate,” she said. 

“Yes.” 

It took a while, but she then 
could smile and say, “Any more 
questions?” 

“Yes . What’s going to be- 
come of Billy?” 

“Oh, he’ll be all right,” she said 
confidently. “He and all his kind. 

142 



He’ll graduate, and train some 
more, and graduate again. He’ll 
stay where he is, perhaps, and 
train others. Or he’ll get a big 
job — skipper of a Moon ferry, 
maybe, or second officer on the 
first Mars ship. Space will make 
him sick — tense, always appre- 
hensive, never comfortable — but 
he’ll be strong and stick it out. " 
And after a while, he’ll retire 
with honors and a pension.” 

“And he’ll never know?” «. 

“That would be too cruel . 
Any more?” 

“Only one big one and I 
haven’t been able to think around 
it. One of the most permeating 
fears of humankind — some say 
the only one we’re actually born 
with and don’t have to learn — 
is the fear of falling. How do you 
equate that with Spaceman?” 

She laughed. “You can’t see 
that?” 

He shook his head. 

She leaned forward, capturing 
him with her eyes and her ur- 
gency. “You are home, where you 
belong, in space, with all of safe 
immensity around you, and it’s 
the way you live, and work, and 
sleep . and suddenly, right 
there, there’s a planet under 
you!” 

It hit him so suddenly, he' * 
gasped and actually strained up- 
ward to get away from the floor, 
the great pressing obtrusive bulk - 
of Earth. “You’re not falling,”

she whispered into the heart of 
his terror. “It’s trying to tall on 
you!” 

He closed his eyes and clutched 
at the table and forced himself 
to reorient. Slowly, then, he 
looked at her and managed to 
grin. “You’ve got yourself a boy,” 
he said. “Let’s get out of here, 
Captain.” 

M Y DEAR Chris and Gerda: 
I do declare I have never 
had my life turned so upsy turvy 
all at once in my life. What with 
you getting married so quick like 
that and then Mr. Magruder find- 
ing you that wonderful job but I 
still dont know what’s so wonder- 
ful about New Zealand of all 
places. Still if your happy. 

Then on top of that Billy run- 
ning out to marry Tess Milburn 
like that just because you two 
did it I don’t understand, I al- 
ways thought Billy had his own 
ideas and couldn’t be led, its as 
if somebody just pushed a button 
and bang he did it, come to think 
of it thats the way he decided to 
go after the Academy thing and 
he says it was you started him 
on this soap carving even. What 
with keeping the marriage secret 
until he graduates and trying to 
find a new bar of soap in the 
house I do declare I don’t know 
where I am. 

Speaking of Mr Magruder 
which I was, he’s no longer with 



me, just paid up his month and 
left without a howdy do. I hear 
he’s with Mrs. Burnett over to 
Cecil Street, all she has is that 
little house and that hopeless 
son who designs cameras and 
whatnot and hides in his room 
all the time, which is pretty in- 
sulting after all I did for him 
for eight solid years. 

Well my dears take care of 
yourselves and send pictures of 
you and your pet sheep or goats 
or whatever it is you crazy kids 
are into. 

Much love, 
Mom.
