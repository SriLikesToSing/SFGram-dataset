THE BUSINESS OF BEING BAD 



A LONG ABOUT now the an- 
nual prizes for worthy con- 
tributions to science fiction will 
be awarded. One of them will, 
as usual, go to somebody for the 
category called “best dramatic 
performance on television or mo- 
tion pictures.” If past perform- 
ance is any criterion, it will go 
to a television show that about 
one voter out of four has seen, 
and fewer than half of those 
really care for. 

The unhappy fact is that for 
this prize there is very little com- 
petition. Science fiction on tele- 
vision is bad enough — if there 
is an area of TV where Commis- 
sioner Minow’s term “wasteland” 
indubitably applies, it is in its 
science-fiction dramas — and as 
for good science-fiction movies, 
there just ain’t no sich animal. 
What was the last good one you 
saw? Most science-fiction readers 



have trouble naming anything 
more recent than The Forbidden 
Planet . and that was half a 
dozen years ago. 

Yet there are plenty of science- 
fiction stories in print that seem 
admirably adapted to motion 
pictures. Why in the world 
doesn’t some smart Hollywood 
producer make a few of them? 

T HERE ARE answers to that 
question, and we’ve gone to 
some trouble to learn a few of 
them. 

The first answer is a single 
word: Money. 

There are two kinds of mo- 
tion pictures being made today, 
the very big ones and the very 
little. The very big ones repre- 
sent such a titanic investment of 
capital and effort that the pro- 
ducers will not bet except on a 
fixed race. That is why there are

THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

$25,000,000 remakes of ancient 
stories; the producers reason that 
if it made money once it will 
make money again, and let the 
other fellow take a chance on 
something new. 

The trouble with that, from 
our point of view, is that few 
really big sf movies have ever 
been made. Thus there isn’t 
much to look for in the way of 
remakes. 

So barring an occasional cour- 
ageous (and thus, in the judg- 
ment of his peers, crazy) experi- 
menter, we can’t hope for a great 
deal in the way of high-budget 
science-fiction movies. That 
leaves us the Grade B artists. 

To produce a quickie for dis- 
tribution as the second half of 
a drive-in’s double bill (and ulti- 
mate consumption on The Late, 
Late Show) costs not much more 
than fifty thousand dollars. Some 
of them have been made for even 
less. This is practically petty 
cash by Hollywood standards (it 
represents about a week’s pay for 
an Elizabeth Taylor), and to 
make it possible every cost is 
pared to the bone. Shooting time 
is held to a single week. Re- 
hearsals are very few. Costumes 
are picked up at Army 8s Navy 
surplus stores; sets are stark, 
cheap and flimsy. If something 
goes wrong in a take it may not 
even be shot over again. The 
writer (who is often the pro- 



ducer, as well as the director) 
hastily tinkers up the script to 
allow the boner, and shooting 
goes on. 

In spite of all this it is aston- 
ishing how competently the ac- 
tors act, the directors direct, the 
photographers shoot and the spe- 
cial-effects men create plausible 
gadgets. These men and women 
are highly skilled professionals. 
They do everything they can. 
What makes the average cheapie 
as terribly bad as it is is not the 
low cost of its production. The 
trouble is that whatever money 
does get spent is spent on the 
wrong story. 

Ten years or so ago — in the 
remote Eocene of television — 
we were privileged to sit in on 
some of the science-fiction pro- 
grams of that era, Captain Video, 
Tales of Tomorrow and a couple 
of others. The average budget of 
these enterprises was a closely 
guarded secret, but it was at least 
an order of magnitude smaller 
than today’s cheapest motion pic- 
ture. The principal staple of scen- 
ery was painted canvas. Stone 
walls rippled to the touch. Ten 
dollars’ worth of electrical parts 
had to do as a $50,000,000 syn- 
chrotron. 

Yet there was hardly one of 
those old TV programs that was 
not better than most of the low- 
budget motion pictures of today! 

The reason they were good is 



6 



GALAXY 



that the producers had the wit 
to make an unusual decision. 
When they wanted science-fiction 
stories written they took their 
courage in their hands and em- 
ployed science-fiction writers 
write them. 

Often it was the science-fiction 
writers themselves — Sheckley, 
Sturgeon, Kornbluth and many 
others — who prepared the ac- 
tual shooting script. When the 
producers could not do that, they 
employed other script writers, 
but took the trouble to have 
them understand what the origi- 
nal story was all about and to 
convert that story to dramatic 
presentation . instead of the 
present custom of throwing ev- 
erything but the name of one 
character out of the window and 
remaking Buck Rogers. 

I T’S TRUE that science-fiction 
stories often rely on rather 
sophisticated ideas — “sophisti- 
cated” in the sense that they are 
developed from previous ideas — 
and it is not always easy to get 
everything possible out of them 
unless the audience has had some 
background in the field. 

It does not, however, follow 
from that that the only way to 
handle science fiction is to ex- 
tract its ideas and destroy them. 

Even if some nuances are 
missed by the non-specialist pub- 
lic, there’s plenty left to provide 



entertainment and pleasure. 
There are dozens of good, sound, 
enjoyable science-fiction stories 
already in print in science-fiction 
books and magazines that need 
hardly the changing of a word, 
and that would still be 99% in- 
telligible to anyone capable of 
reading without moving his lips. 

Maybe better times are ahead. 
Right at this moment there are 
a number of fine science-fiction 
writers who have turned to TV 
and motion pictures — Robert 
Bloch, Fritz Leiber, Jerome Bix- 
by, Arthur C. Clarke, John 
Wyndham and half a dozen 
others are in some way or an- 
other involved — and from their 
efforts we may yet see great 
things. 

We also may not, because the 
producers not only seem to make 
it a point to have non-sf writers 
write their science-fiction, but 
when a science-fiction writer 
comes along they seem to make 
it their business to put him to 
work on a mystery or a Western 

— instead of what he can do best 
of all. 

Science-fiction doesn’t have to 
be relegated to the part of the 
drive-in program where the cus- 
tomers quit watching the screen 

— but it is likely to go on that 
way, until some producer dis- 
covers that it really has things 
to say that cannot be said in any 
other form! — THE EDITOR

meters high, twenty meters broad. 
Behind it was the “fourth valve,” 
almost a thousand hectares in ex- 
tent. It was shaped helically, like 
an enormous snail. Jestocost’s 
apartment, big as it was, was 
merely one of the pigeonholes in 
the muffler on the rim of Earth- 
port. Earthport stood like an 
enormous wineglass, reaching 
from the magma to the high at- 
mosphere. 

Earthport had been built dur- 
ing mankind’s biggest mechanical 
splurge. Though men had had nu- 
clear rockets since the beginning 
of consecutive history, they had 
used chemical rockets to load the 
interplanetary ion-drive and nu- 
clear-drive vehicles or to assemble 
the photonic sail-ships for inter- 
stellar cruises. Impatient with the 
troubles of taking things bit by 
bit into the sky, they had worked 
out a billion-ton rocket, only to 
find that it ruined whatever coun- 
tryside it touched in landing. The 
Daimoni — people of Earth ex- 
traction, who came back from 
somewhere beyond the stars — 
had helped men build it of 
weatherproof, rustproof, time- 
proof, stressproof material. Then 
they had gone away and had 
never come back. 

Jestocost often looked around 
his apartment and wondered what 
it might have been like when 
white-hot gas, muted to a whisper, 
surged out of the valve into his 



own chamber and the sixty-four 
other chambers like it. Now he 
had a back wall of heavy timber, 
and the valve itself was a great 
hollow cave where a few wild 
things lived. Nobody needed that 
much space any more. The cham- 
bers were useful, but the valve 
did nothing. Pianoforming ships 
whispered in from the stars; they 
landed at Earthport as a matter 
of legal convenience, but they 
made no noise and they certainly 
had no hot gases. 

Jestocost looked at the high 
clouds far below him and talked 
to himself, 

“Nice day. Good air. No trou- 
ble. Better eat.” 

Jestocost often talked like that 
to himself. He was an individual, 
almost an eccentric. One of the 
top council of mankind, he had 
problems, but they were not per- 
sonal problems. He had a Rem- 
brandt hanging above his bed — 
the only Rembrandt known in the 
world, just as he was possibly the 
only person who could appreciate 
a Rembrandt. He had the tapes- 
tries of a forgotten empire hang- 
ing from his back wall. Every 
morning the sun played a grand 
opera for him, muting and light- 
ing and shifting the colors so that 
he could almost imagine that the 
old days of quarrel, murder and 
high drama had come back to 
Earth again. He had a copy of 
Shakespeare, a copy of Colegrove 



10 



GALAXY 



and two pages of the Book of 
Ecclesiates in a locked box beside 
his bed. Only forty-two people in 
the universe could read Ancient 
English, and he was one of them. 
He drank wine, which he had 
made by his own robots in his 
own vineyards on the Sunset 
coast. He was a man, in short, 
who had arranged his own life to 
live comfortably, selfishly and 
well on the personal side, so that 
he could give generously and im- 
partially of his talents on the 
official side. 

When he awoke on this par- 
ticular morning, he had no idea 
that a beautiful girl was about to 
fall hopelessly in love with him 
— that he would find, after a 
hundred years and more of ex- 
perience in government, another 
government on earth just as 
strong and almost as ancient as 
his own — that he would willingly 
fling himself into conspiracy and 
danger for a cause which he only 
half understood. All these things 
were mercifully hidden from him 
by time, so that his only question 
on arising was, should he or 
should he not have a small cup 
of white wine with his breakfast. 
On the 173rd day of each year, 
he always made a point of eating 
eggs. They were a rare treat, and 
he did not want to spoil himself 
by having too many, nor to de- 
prive himself and forget a treat 
by having none at all. He put- 



tered around the room, mutter- 
ing, “White wine? White wine?” 

/^’MELL was coming into his 
life, but he did not know it. 
She was fated to win; that part, 
she herself did not know. 

Ever since mankind had gone 
through the Rediscovery of Man, 
bringing back governments, mon- 
ey, newspapers, national lan- 
guages, sickness and occasional 
death, there had been the problem 
of the underpeople — people who 
were not human, but merely hu- 
manly shaped from the stock of 
Earth animals. They could speak, 
sing, read, write, work, love and 
die; but they were not covered by 
human law, which simply defined 
them as “homunculi” and gave 
them a legal status close to ani- 
mals or robots. Real people from 
off-world were always called “ho- 
minids.” 

Most of the underpeople did 
their jobs and accepted their 
half-slave status without question. 
Some became famous — C’mack- 
intosh had been the first earth- 
being to manage a thousand- 
meter broad-jump under normal 
gravity. His picture was seen in 
a thousand worlds. His daughter, 
C’mell, was a girly girl, earning 
her living by welcoming human 
beings and hominids from the out- 
worlds and making them feel at 
home when they reached Earth. 
She had the privilege of working 



THE BALLAD OF LOST C'MELL 



11 



at Earthport, but she had the duty 
of working very hard for a living 
which did not pay well. Human 
beings and hominids had lived so 
long in an affluent society that 
they did not know what it meant 
to be poor. But the Lords of the 
Instrumentality had decreed that 
underpeople — derived from an- 
imal stock — should live under the 
economics of the Ancient World; 
they had to have their own kind 
of money to pay for their rooms, 
their food, their possessions and 
the education of their children. If 
they became bankrupt, they went 
to the Poorhouse, where they 
were killed painlessly by means 
of gas. 

It was evident that humanity, 
having settled all of its own basic 
problems, was not quite ready to 
let Earth animals, no matter how 
much they might be changed, as- 
sume a full equality with man. 

The Lord Jestocost, seventh of 
that name, opposed the policy. He 
was a man who had little love, 
no fear, freedom from ambition 
and a dedication to his job: but 
there are passions of government 
as deep and challenging as the 
emotions of love. Two hundred 
years of thinking himself right 
and of being outvoted had in- 
stilled in Jestocost a furious desire 
to get things done his own way. 

Jestocost was one of the few 
true men who believed in the 
rights of the underpeople. He did 



not think that mankind would 
ever get around to correcting an- 
cient wrongs unless the under- 
people themselves had some of 
the tools of power — weapons, 
conspiracy, wealth and (above 
all) organization with which to 
challenge man. He was not afraid 
of revolt, but he thirsted for jus- 
tice with an obsessive yearning 
which overrode all other consider- 
ations. 

When the Lords of the Instru- 
mentality heard that there was 
the rumor of a conspiracy among 
the underpeople, they left it to 
the robot police to ferret out. 

Jestocost did not. 

He set up his own police, using 
underpeople themselves for the 
purpose, hoping to recruit enemies 
who would realize that he was a 
friendly enemy and who would 
in course of time bring him into 
touch with the leaders of the 
underpeople. 

If those leaders existed, they 
were clever. What sign did a girly 
girl like C’mell ever give that she 
was the spearhead of a criss-cross 
of agents who had penetrated 
Earthport itself? They must, if 
they existed, be very, very careful. 
The telepathic monitors, both ro- 
botic and human, kept every 
thought-band under surveillance 
by random sampling. Even the 
computers showed nothing more 
significant than improbable 
amounts of happiness in minds 



12 



GALAXY 



which had no objective reason for 
being happy. 

The death of her father, the 
most famous cat-athlete which 
the underpeople had ever pro- 
duced, gave Jestocost his first 
definite clue. 

H E WENT to the funeral him- 
self, where the body was 
packed in an ice-rocket to be shot 
into space. The mourners were 
thoroughly mixed with the curi- 
osity-seekers. Sport is internation- 
al, inter-race, inter-world, inter- 
species. Hominids were there: 
true men, 100% human, they 
looked weird and horrible because 
they or their ancestors had under- 
gone bodily modifications to meet 
the life conditions of a thousand 
worlds. 

Underpeople, the animal-de- 
rived “homunculi,” were there, 
most of them in their work 
clothes, and they looked more 
human than did the human be- 
ings from the outer worlds. None 
were allowed to grow up if they 
were less than half the size of 
man, or more than six times the 
size of man. They all had to have 
human features and acceptable 
human voices. The punishment 
for failure in their elementary 
schools was death. Jestocost 
looked over the crowd and won- 
dered to himself, “We have set up 
the standards of the toughest kind 
of survival for these people and 



we give them the most terrible 
incentive, life itself, as the con- 
dition of absolute progress. What 
fools we are to think that they 
will not overtake us!” The true 
people in the group did not seem 
to think as he did. They tapped 
the underpeople peremptorily 
with their canes, even though this 
was an underperson’s funeral, and 
the bear-men, bull-men, cat-men 
and others yielded immediately 
and with a babble of apology. 

C’mell was close to her father’s 
icy coffin. 

Jestocost not only watched her; 
she was pretty to watch. He com- 
mitted an act which was an in- 
decency in an ordinary citizen but 
lawful for a Lord of the Instru- 
mentality: he peeped her mind. 

And then he found something 
which he did not expect. 

As the coffin left, she cried, 
“Ee-telly-kelly, help me! help 
me!” 

She had thought phonetically, 
not in script, and he had only the 
raw sound on which to base a 
search. 

Jestocost had not become a 
Lord of the Instrumentality with- 
out applying daring. His mind 
was quick, too quick to be deeply 
intelligent. He thought by gestalt, 
not by logic. He determined to 
force his friendship on the girl. 

He decided to await a propi- 
tious occasion, and then changed 
his mind about the time. 



THE BALLAD OF LOST C'MELL

As she went home from the 
funeral, he intruded upon the 
circle of her grimfaced friends, 
underpeople who were trying to 
shield her from the condolences 
of ill-mannered but well-meaning 
sports enthusiasts. 

She recognized him, and 
showed him the proper respect. 

“My Lord, I did not expect you 
here. You knew my father?” 

He nodded gravely and ad- 
dressed sonorous words of con- 
solation and sorrow, words which 
brought a murmur of approval 
from humans and underpeople 
alike. 

But with his left hand hanging 
slack at his side, he made the per- 
petual signal of alarm! alarm! 
used within the Earthport staff 
— a repeated tapping of the 
thumb against the third finger — 
when they had to set one another 
on guard without alerting the off- 
world transients. 

She was so upset that she al- 
most spoiled it all. While he was 
still doing his pious doubletalk, 
she cried in a loud clear voice: 
“You mean me?” 

And he went on with his con- 
dolences: “. and I do mean you, 
C’mell, to be the worthiest carrier 
of your father’s name. You are 
the one to whom we turn in this 
time of common sorrow. Who 
could I mean but you if I say 
that C’mackintosh never did 
things by halves, and died young 



as a result of his own zealous con- 
science? Good-by, C’mell, I go 
back to ray office.” 

She arrived forty minutes after 
he did. 

II 

TTE FACED her straight away, 
studying her face. 

“This is an important day in 
your life.” 

“Yes, my Lord, a sad one.” 

“I do not,” he said, “mean your 
father’s death and burial. I speak 
of the future to which we all must 
turn. Right now, it’s you and me.” 
Her eyes widened. She had not 
thought that he was that kind of 
man at all. He was an official who 
moved freely around Earthport, 
often greeting important offworld 
visitors and keeping an eye on the 
bureau of ceremonies. She was a 
part of the reception team, when 
a girly girl was needed to calm 
down a frustrated arrival or to 
postpone a quarrel. Like the 
geisha of ancient Japan, she had 
an honorable profession; she was 
not a bad girl but a professionally 
flirtatious hostess. She stared at 
the Lord Jestocost. He did not 
look as though he meant anything 
improperly personal. But, thought 
she, you can never tell about men. 

“You know men,” he said, pass- 
ing the initiative to her. 

“I guess so,” she said. Her face 
looked odd. She started to give

him smile #3 (extremely adhe- 
sive ) which she had learned in the 
girly-girl school. Realizing it was 
wrong, she tried to give him an 
ordinary smile. She felt she had 
made a face at him. 

“Look at me,” he said, “and see 
if you can trust me. I am going to 
take both our lives in my hands.” 

She looked at him. What imag- 
inable subject could involve him, 
a Lord of the Instrumentality, 
with herself, an undergirl? They 
never had anything in common. 
They never would. 

But she stared at him. 

“I want to help the under- 
people.” 

He made her blink. That was 
a crude approach, usually fol- 
lowed by a very raw kind of pass 
indeed. But his face was illumi- 
nated by seriousness. She waited. 

“Your people do not have 
enough political power even to 
talk to us. I will not commit trea- 
son to the true-human race, but 
I am willing to give your side an 
advantage. If you bargain better 
with us, it will make all forms of 
life safer in the long run.” 

C’mell stared at the floor, her 
red hair soft as the fur of a Per- 
sian cat. It made her head seemed 
bathed in flames. Her eyes looked 
human, except that they had the 
capacity of reflecting when light 
struck them; the irises were the 
rich green of the ancient cat. 
When she looked right at him, 



looking up from the floor, her 
glance had the impact of a blow. 
“What do you want from me?” 

He stared right back. “Watch 
me. Look at my face. Are you 
sure, sure that I want nothing 
from you personally?” 

C^E looked bewildered. “What 
^ else is there to want from me 
except personal things? I am a 
girly girl. I’m not a person of any 
importance at all, and I do not 
have much of an education. You 
know more, sir, than I will ever 
know.” 

“Possibly,” he said, watching 
her. 

She stopped feeling like a girly 
girl and felt like a citizen. It made 
her uncomfortable. 

“Who,” he said, in a voice of 
great solemnity, “is your own 
leader?” 

“Commissioner Teadrinker, sir. 
He’s in charge of all outworld 
visitors.” She watched Jestocost 
carefully; he still did not look as 
if he were playing tricks. 

He looked a little cross. “I don’t 
mean him. He’s part of my own 
staff. Who’s your leader among 
the underpeople?” 

“My father was, but he died.” 

Jestocost said. “Forgive me. 
Please have a seat. But I don’t 
mean that.” 

She was so tired that she sat 
down into the chair with an in- 
nocent voluptuousness which 



would have disorganized any or- 
dinary man’s day. She wore girly 
girl clothes, which were close 
enough to the everyday fashion 
to seem agreeably modish when 
she stood up. In line with her 
profession, her clothes were de- 
signed to be unexpectedly and 
provocatively revealing when she 
sat down — not revealing enough 
to shock the man with their 
brazenness, but so slit, tripped 
and cut that he got far more visual 
stimulation than he expected. 

“I must ask you to pull your 
clothing together a little,” said 
Jestocost in a clinical turn of 
voice. “I am a man, even if I am 
an official, and this interview is 
more important to you and to me 
than any distraction would be.” 

She was a little frightened by 
his tone. She had meant no chal- 
lenge. With the funeral that day, 
she meant nothing at all; these 
clothes were the only kind she 
had. 

He read all this in her face. 

Relentlessly, he pursued the 
subject. 

“Young lady, I asked about 
your leader. You name your boss 
and you name your father. I want 
your leader.” 

“I don’t understand,” she said, 
on the edge of a sob, “I don’t un- 
derstand.” 

Then, he thought to himself, 
I’ve got to take a gamble. He 
thrust the mental dagger home, 



almost drive his words like steel 
straight into her face. “Who . .” 
he said, slowly and icily, “is . 
Ee . telly . kelly?” 

The girl’s face had been cream- 
colored, pale with sorrow. Now 
she went white. She twisted away 
from him. Her eyes glowed like 
twin fires. 

Her eyes . like twin fires. 

(No undergirl, thought Jesto- 
cost as he reeled, could hypnotize 
me.) 

Her eyes . were like cold fires. 

The room faded around him. 
The girl disappeared. Her eyes 
became a single white, cold fire. 

Within this fire stood the figure 
of a man. His arms were wings, 
but he had human hands growing 
at the elbows of his wings. His 
face was clear, white, cold as the 
marble of an ancient statue; his 
eyes were opaque white. “I am 
the E-telekeli. You will believe in 
me. You may speak to my daugh- 
ter C’mell.” 

The image faded. 

Jestocost saw the girl staring 
as she sat awkwardly on the chair, 
looking blindly through him. He 
was on the edge of making a joke 
about her hypnotic capacity when 
he saw that she was still deeply 
hypnotized, even after he had 
been released. She had stiffened 
and again her clothing had fallen 
into its planned disarray. The ef- 
fect was not stimulating; it was 
pathetic beyond words, as though

an accident had happened to a 
pretty child. He spoke to her. 

TTE SPOKE to her, not really 
expecting an answer. 

“Who are you?” he said to her, 
testing her hypnosis. 

“I am"he whose name is never 
said aloud,” said the girl in a 
sharp whisper, “I am he whose 
secret you have penetrated. I 
have printed my image and my 
name in your mind.” 

Jestocost did not quarrel with 
ghosts like this. He snapped out 
a decision. “If I open my mind, 
will you search it while I watch 
you? Are you good enough to do 
that?” 

“I am very good,” hissed the 
voice in the girl’s mouth. 

C’mell arose and put her two 
hands on his shoulders. She 
looked into his eyes. He looked 
back. A strong telepath himself, 
Jestocost was not prepared for 
the enormous thought-voltage 
which poured out of her. 

Look in my mind, he com- 
manded, for the subject of under- 
people only. 

I see it, thought the mind be- 
hind C’mell. 

Do you see what I mean to do 
for the underpeople? 

Jestocost heard the girl breath- 
ing hard as her mind served as a 
relay to his. He tried to remain 
calm so that he could see which 
part of his mind was being 



searched. Very good so far, he 
thought to himself. An intelli- 
gence like that on Earth itself, he 
thought — and we of the Lords 
not knowing it! 

The girl hacked out a dry little 
laugh. 

Jestocost thought at the mind, 
Sorry. Go ahead. 

This plan of yours — thought 
the strange mind — may I see 
more of it? 

That’s all there is. 

Oh, said the strange mind, you 
want me to think for you. Can 
you give me the keys in the Bank 
and Bell which pertain to destroy- 
ing underpeople? 

You can have the information 
keys if I can ever get them, 
thought Jestocost, but not the 
control keys and not the master 
switch of the Bell. 

Fair enough, thought the other 
mind, and what do I pay for 
them? 

You support me in my policies 
before the instrumentality. You 
keep the underpeople reasonable, 
if you can, when the time comes 
to negotiate. You maintain honor 
and good faith in all subsequent 
agreements. But how can I get the 
keys? It would take me a year to 
figure them out myself. 

Let the girl look once, thought 
the strange mind, and I will be 
behind her. Fair? 

Fair, thought Jestocost. 

Break? thought the mind. 



THE BALLAD OF LOST C'MELL

How do we re-connect? thought 
Jestocost back. 

As before. Through the girl. 
Never say my name. Don’t think 
it if you can help it. Break? 

Break! thought Jestocost. 

The girl, who had been holding 
his shoulders, drew his face down 
and kissed him firmly and warm- 
ly. He had never touched an un- 
derperson before, and it never 
had occurred to him that he might 
kiss one. It was pleasant, but he 
took her arms away from his 
neck, half-turned her around, and 
let her lean against him. 

“Daddy!” she sighed happily. 

Suddenly she stiffened, looked 
at his face, and sprang for the 
door. “Jestocost!” she cried. “Lord 
Jestocost! What am I doing here?” 

“Your duty is done, my girl. 
You may go.” 

She staggered back into the 
room. “I am going to be sick,” she 
said. She vomited on his floor. 

He pushed a button for a clean- 
ing robot and slapped his desk- 
top for coffee. 

She relaxed and talked about 
his hopes for the underpeople. She 
stayed an hour. By the time she 
left they had a plan. Neither of 
them had mentioned E-telekeli, 
neither had put purposes in the 
open. If the monitors had been 
listening, they would have found 
no single sentence or paragraph 
which was suspicious. 

When she had gone, Jestocost 



looked out of his window. He saw 
the clouds far below and he knew 
the world below him was in twi- 
light. He had planned to help the 
underpeople, and he had met , 
powers of which organized man- 
kind had no conception or percep- 
tion. He was righter than he had 
thought. He had to go on through. 

But as partner — C’mell herself! 

Was there ever an odder diplo- 
mat in the history of worlds? 

Ill 

TN LESS than a week they had 
decided what to do. It was the 
Council of the Lords of the In- 
strumentality at which they 
would work — the brain center 
itself. The risk was high, but 
the entire job could be done in a 
few minutes if it were done at the 
Bell itself. 

This is the sort of thing which 
interested Jestocost. 

He did not know that C’mell 
watched him with two different 
facets of her mind. One side of 
her was alertly and wholehearted- 
ly his fellow-conspirator, utterly 
in sympathy with the revolution- 
ary aims to which they were both 
committed. The other side of her 
— was feminine. 

She had a womanliness which 
was truer than that of any homi- 
nid woman. She knew the value 
of her trained smile, her splendid- 
ly kept red hair with its unimagin- 



18 



GALAXY 



ably soft texture, her lithe young 
figure with firm breasts and per- 
suasive hips. She knew down to 
the last millimeter the effect 
which her legs had on hominid 
men. True humans kept few se- 
crets from her. The men betrayed 
themselves by their unfulfillable 
desires, the woman by their ir- 
repressible jealousies. But she 
knew people best of all by not 
being one herself. She had to 
learn by imitation, and imitation 
is conscious. A thousand little 
things which ordinary women 
took for granted, or thought about 
just once in a whole lifetime, were 
subjects of acute and intelligent 
study to her. She was a girl by 
profession; she was a human by 
assimilation; she was an inquisi- 
tive cat in her genetic nature. 
Now she was falling in love with 
Jestocost, and she knew it. 

Even she did not realize that 
the romance would sometime leak 
cut into rumor, be magnified into 
legend, distilled into romance. She 
had no idea of the ballad about 
herself that would open with the 
lines which became famous much 
later: 

She got the which of the what-she-did, 

Hid the bell with a blot, she did, 

But she fell in love with a hominid. 

Where is the which of the what-she-did? 

All this lay in the future, and 
she did not know it. 

She knew her own past. 



She remembered the off-Earth 
prince who had rested his head in 
her lap and had said, sipping his 
glass of motl by way of farewell: 
“Funny, C’mell, you’re not even 
a person and you’re the most in- 
telligent human being I’ve met in 
this place. Do you know it made 
my planet poor to send me here? 
And what did I get out of them? 
Nothing, nothing, and a thousand 
times nothing. But you, now. If 
you’d been running the govern- 
ment of Earth, I’d have gotten 
what my people need, and this 
world would be richer too. Man- 
home, they call it. Manhome, my 
eye! The only smart person on 
it is a female cat.” 

He ran his fingers around her 
ankle. She did not stir. That was 
part of hospitality, and she had 
her own ways of making sure that 
hospitality did not go too far. 
Earth police were watching her; 
to them, she was a convenience 
maintained for outworld people, 
something like a soft chair in the 
Earthport lobbies or a drinking 
fountain with acid-tasting water 
for strangers who could not tol- 
erate the insipid water of Earth. 
She was not expected to have 
feelings or to get involved. If she 
had ever caused an incident, they 
would have punished her fiercely, 
as they often punished animals 
or underpeople, or else (after a 
short formal hearing with no ap- 
peal) they would have destroyed 



THE BALLAD OF LOST C'MELL

her, as the law allowed and cus- 
tom encouraged. 

She had kissed a thousand men, 
maybe fifteen hundred. She had 
made them feel welcome and she 
had gotten their complaints or 
their secrets out of them as they 
left. It was a living, emotionally 
tiring but intellectually very stim- 
ulating. Sometimes it made her 
laugh to look at human women 
with their pointed-up noses and 
their proud airs, and to realize 
that she knew more about the 
men who belonged to the human 
women than the human women 
themselves ever did. 

O NCE A policewoman had had 
to read over the record of two 
pioneers from New Mars. C’mell 
had been given the job of keeping 
in very close touch with them. 
When the policewoman got 
through reading the report she 
looked at C’mell and her face was 
distorted with jealousy and prud- 
ish rage. 

“Cat, you call yourself. Cat! 
You’re a pig, you’re a dog, you’re 
an animal. You may be working 
for Earth but don’t ever get the 
idea that you’re as good as a per- 
son. I think if s a crime that the 
Instrumentality lets monsters like 
you greet real human beings from 
outside! I can’t stop it. But may 
the Bell help you, girl, if you ever 
touch a real Earth man! If you 
ever get near one! If you ever try 



tricks here! Do you understand 
me?” 

“Yes, ma’am,” C’mell had said. 
To herself she thought, “That 
poor thing doesn’t know how to 
select her own clothes or how to 
do her own hair. No wonder she 
resents somebody who manages 
to be pretty.” 

Perhaps the policewoman 
thought that raw hatred would be 
shocking to C’mell. It wasn’t. Un- 
derpeople were used to hatred, 
and it was not any worse raw 
than it was when cooked with 
politeness and served like poison. 
They had to live with it. 

But now, it was all changed. 

She had fallen in love with 
Jestocost. 

Did he love her? 

Impossible. No, not impossible. 
Unlawful, unlikely, indecent — 
yes, all these, but not impossible. 
Surely he felt something of her 
love. 

If he did, he gave no sign -of it. 

People and underpeople had 
fallen in love many times before. 
The underpeople were always de- 
stroyed and the real people brain- 
washed. There were laws against 
that kind of thing. The scientists 
among people had created the 
underpeople, had given them ca- 
pacities which real people did not 
have (the thousand-yard jump, 
the telepath two miles under- 
ground, the turtle-man waiting a 
thousand years next to an emer- 



20 



GALAXY 



gency door, the cow-man guard- 
ing a gate without reward), and 
the scientists had also given many 
of the underpeople the human 
shape. It was handier that way. 
The human eye, the five-fingered 
hand, the human size ■ — these 
were convenient for engineering 
reasons. By making underpeople 
the same size and shape as people, 
more or less, the scientists elimi- 
nated the need for two or three or 
a dozen different sets of furniture. 
The human form was good 
enough for all of them. 

But they had forgotten the hu- 
man heart. 

And now she, C’mell, had fallen 
in love with a man, a true man 
old enough to have been her own 
father’s grandfather. 

But she didn’t feel daughterly 
about him at all. She remembered 
that with her own father there 
was an easy comradeship, an in- 
nocent and forthcoming affection, 
which masked the fact that he 
was considerably more cat-like 
than she was. Between them there 
was an aching void of forever- 
unspoken words — things that 
couldn’t quite be said by either of 
them, perhaps things that couldn’t 
be said at all. They were so close 
to each other that they could get 
no closer. This created enormous 
distance, which was heartbreak- 
ing but unutterable. Her father 
had died, and now this true man 
was here, with all the kindness — 



“That’s it,” she whispered to 
herself, “with all the kindness that 
none of these passing men have 
ever really shown. With all the 
depth which my poor under- 
people can never get. Not that 
it’s not in them. But they’re born 
like dirt, treated like dirt, put 
away like dirt when we die. How 
can any of my own men develop 
real kindness? There’s a special 
sort of majesty to kindness. It’s 
the best part there is to being 
people. And he has whole oceans 
of it in him. And it’s strange, 
strange, strange that he’s never 
given his real love to any human 
woman.” 

She stopped, cold. 

Then she consoled herself and 
whispered on, “Or if he did, it’s 
so long ago that it doesn’t matter 
now. He’s got me. Does he know 
it?” 

IV 

r T'HE Lord Jestocost did know, 
and yet he didn’t. He was 
used to getting loyalty from peo- 
ple, because he offered loyalty 
and honor in his daily work. He 
was even familiar with loyalty be- 
coming obsessive and seeking 
physical form, particularly from 
women, children and underpeople. 
He had always coped with it be- 
fore. He was gambling on the fact 
that C’mell was a wonderfully in- 
telligent person, and that as a 



THE BALLAD OF LOST C'MELL 



21 



girly girl, working on the hospital- 
ity staff of the Earthport police, 
she must have learned to control 
her personal feelings. 

“We’re born in the wrong age,” 
he thought, “when I meet the 
most intelligent and beautiful fe- 
male I’ve ever met, and then have 
to put business first. But this stuff 
about people and underpeople is 
sticky. Sticky. We’ve got to keep 
personalities out of it.” 

So he thought. Perhaps he was 
right. 

If the nameless one, whom he 
did not dare to remember, com- 
manded an attack on the Bell it- 
self, that was worth their lives. 
Their emotions could not come 
into it. The Bell mattered: justice 
mattered: the perpetual return of 
mankind to progress mattered. He 
did not matter, because he had al- 
ready done most of his work. 
C’mell did not matter, because 
their failure would leave her with 
mere underpeople forever. The 
Bell did count. 

The price of what he proposed 
to do was high, but the entire 
job could be done in a few min- 
utes if it were done at the Bell 
itself. 

The Bell, of course, was not a 
Bell. It was a three-dimensional 
situation table, three times the 
height of a man. It was set one 
story below the meeting room, 
and shaped roughly like an an- 
cient bell. The meeting table of 



the Lords of the Instrumentality 
had a circle cut out of it, so that 
the Lords could look down into 
the Bell at whatever situation one 
of them called up either manually 
or telepathically. The Bank below 
it, hidden by the floor, was the 
key memory-bank of the entire 
system. Duplicates existed at 
thirty-odd other places on Earth. 
Two duplicates lay hidden in in- 
terstellar space, one of them be- 
side the ninety-million-mile gold- 
colored ship left over from the 
War against Raumsog and the 
other masked as an asteroid. 

Most of the Lords were off- 
world on the business of the In- 
strumentality. 

Only three beside Jestocost 
were present — the Lady Johanna 
Gnade, the Lord Issan Olascoaga 
and the Lord William Not-from- 
here. (The Not-from-heres were 
a great Norstrilian family which 
had migrated back to Earth many 
generations before.) 

The E-telekeli told Jestocost 
the rudiments of a plan. 

He was to bring C’mell into the 
chambers on a summons. 

The summons was to be seri- 
ous. 

They should avoid her sum- 
mary death by automatic justice, 
if the relays began to trip. 

C’mell would go into partial 
trance in the chamber. 

He was then to call the items 
in the Bell which E-telekeli 



22 



GALAXY 



1 




wanted traced. A single call would 
be enough. E-telekeli would take 
the responsibility for tracing 
them. The other Lords would be 
distracted by him, E-telekeli. 

It was simple in appearance. 

The complication came in ac- 
tion. 

The plan seemed flimsy, but 
there was nothing which Jestocost 
could do at this time. He began 
to curse himself for letting his 
passion for policy involve him in 
the intrigue. It was too late to 
back out with honor; besides, he 
had given his word; besides, he 
liked C’mell — as a being, not as 
a girly girl — and he would hate 
to see her marked with disap- 
pointment for life. He knew how 
the underpeople cherished their 
identities and their status. 

With heavy heart but quick 
mind he went to the council 
chamber. A dog-girl, one of the 
routine messengers whom he had 
seen many months outside the 
door, gave him the minutes. 

He wondered how C’mell or 
E-telekeli would reach him, once 
he was inside the chamber with 
its tight net of telepathic inter- 
cepts. 

He sat wearily at the table — 

And almost jumped out of his 
chair. 

r T , HE conspirators had forged 
the minutes themselves, and 
the top item was: “C’mell daugh- 



ter to C’mackintosh, cat-stock 
(pmre) lot 1138, confession of. 
Subject: conspiracy to export ho- 
muncular material. Reference: 
planet De Prinsensmacht.” 

The Lady Johanna Gnade had 
already pushed the buttons for 
the planet concerned. The people 
there, Earth by origin, were enor- 
mously strong but they had gone 
to great pains to maintain the 
original Earth appearance. One 
of their first-men was at the mo- 
ment on Earth. He bore the title 
of the Twilight Prince (Prins van 
de Schemering) and he was on a 
mixed diplomatic and trading mis- 
sion. 

Since Jestocost was a little late, 
C’mell was being brought into the 
room as he glanced over the min- 
utes. 

The Lord Not-from-here asked 
Jestocost if he would preside. 

“I beg you, sir and scholar,” he 
said, “to join me in asking the 
Lord Issan to preside this time.” 

The presidency was a formal- 
ity. Jestocost could watch the Bell 
and Bank better if he did not 
have to chair the meeting too. 

C’mell wore the clothing of a 
prisoner. On her it looked good. 
He had never seen her wearing 
anything but girly-girl clothes be- 
fore. The pale-blue prison tunic 
made her look very young, very 
human, very tender and very 
frightened. The cat family showed 
only in the fiery cascade of her

hair and the lithe power of her 
body as she sat, demure and erect. 

Lord Issan asked her: “You 
have confessed. Confess again.” 

“This man,” and she pointed at 
a picture of the Twilight Prince, 
“wanted to go to the place where 
they torment human children for 
a show.” 

“What!” cried three of the 
Lords together. 

“What place?” said the Lady 
Johanna, who was bitterly in 
favor of kindness. 



“It’s run by a man who looks 
like this gentleman here,” said 
C’mell, pointing at Jestocost. 
Quickly, so that nobody could 
stop her, but modestly, so that 
none of them thought to doubt 
her, she circled the room and 
touched Jestocost’s shoulder. He 
felt a thrill of contact-telepathy 
and heard bird-crackle in her 
brain. Then he knew that the E- 
telekeli was in touch with her. 

“The man who has the place,” 
said C’mell, “is five pounds lighter 



than this gentleman, two inches 
shorter, and he has red hair. His 
place is at the Cold Sunset corner 
of Earthport, down the boulevard 
and under the boulevard. Under- 
people, some of them with bad 
reputations, live in that neighbor- 
hood.” 

The Bell went milky, flashing 
through hundreds of combinations 
of bad underpeople in that part of 
the city. Jestocost felt himself 
staring at the casual milkiness 
with unwanted concentration. 



The Bell cleared. 

It showed the vague image of 
a room in which children were 
playing Hallowe’en tricks. 

The Lady Johanna laughed, 
“Those aren’t people. They’re ro- 
bots. It’s just a dull old play.” 
“Then,” added C’mell, “he 
wanted a dollar and a shilling to 
take home. Real ones. There was 
a robot who had found some.” 
“What are those?” said Lord 
Issan. 

“Ancient money — the real 



24 



GALAXY 



THE BALLAD OF LOST C'MELL 






25 





money of old America and old 
Australia,” cried Lord William. 
“I have copies, but there are no 
originals outside the state muse- 
um.” He was an ardent, passionate 
collector of coins. 

“The robot found them in an 
old hiding place right under 
Earth port.” 

T ORD William almost shouted 
at the Bell. “Run through 
every hiding place and get me 
that money.” 

The Bell clouded. In finding 
the bad neighborhoods it had 
flashed every police point in the 
Northwest sector of the tower. 
Now it scanned all the police 
points under the tower, and ran 
dizzily through thousands of com- 
binations before it settled on an 
old toolroom. A robot was polish- 
ing circular pieces of metal. 

When Lord William saw the 
polishing, he was furious. “Get 
that here,” he shouted. “I want 
to buy those myself!” 

“All right,” said Lord Issan. “It’s 
a little irregular, but all right.” 
The machine showed the key 
search devices and brought the 
robot to the escalator. 

The Lord Issan said, “This isn’t 
much of a case.” 

C’mell sniveled. She was a good 
actress. “Then he wanted me to 
get a homunculus egg. One of the 
E-type, derived from birds, for 
him to take home.” 



Issan put on the search device. 
“Maybe,” said C’mell, “some- 
body has already put it in the 
disposal series.” 

The Bell and the Bank ran 
through all the disposal devices 
at high speed. Jestocost felt his 
nerves go on edge. No human be- 
ing could have memorized these 
thousands of patterns as they 
flashed across the Bell too fast 
for human eyes, but the brain 
reading the Bell through his eyes 
was not human. It might even be 
locked into a computer of its 
own. It was, thought Jestocost, an 
indignity for a Lord of the In- 
strumentality to be used as a 
human spy-glass. 

The machine blotted up. 
“You’re a fraud,” cried the Lord 
Issan. “There’s no evidence.” 
“Maybe the offworlder tried,” 
said the Lady Johanna. 

“Shadow him,” said Lord Wil- 
liam. “If he would steal ancient 
coins he would steal anything.” 
The Lady Johanna turned to 
C’mell. “You’re a silly thing. You 
have wasted our time and you 
have kept us from serious inter- 
world business.” 

“It is inter-world business,” 
wept C’mell. She let her hand slip 
from Jestocost’s shoulder, where 
it had rested all the time. The 
body-to-body relay broke and the 
telepathic link broke with it. 

“We should judge that,” said 
Lord Issan.

“You might have been pun- 
ished,” said Lady Johanna. 

The Lord Jestocost had said 
nothing, but there was a glow of 
happiness in him. If the E-telekeli 
was half as good as he seemed, 
the underpeople had a list of 
checkpoints and escape routes 
which would make it easier to 
hide from the capricious sentence 
of painless death which human 
authorities meted out. 

V 

T HERE was singing in the cor- 
ridors that night. 

Underpeople burst into happi- 
ness for no visible reason. 

C’mell danced a wild cat dance 
for the next customer who came 
in from outworld stations, that 
very evening. When she got home 
to bed, she knelt before the pic- 
ture of her father C’mackintosh 
and thanked the E-telekeli for 
what Jestocost had done. 

But the story became known 
a few generations later, when the 
Lord Jestocost had won acclaim 
for being the champion of the 
underpeople and when the author- 
ities, still unaware of E-telekeli, 
accepted the elected representa- 
tives of the underpeople as ne- 
gotiators for better terms of life; 
and C’mell had died long since. 

She had first had a long, good 
life. 

She became a female chef when 



she was too old to be a girly girl. 
Her food was famous. Jestocost 
once visited her. At the end of 
the meal he had asked, “There’s 
a silly rhyme among the under- 
people. No human beings know it 
except me.” 

“I don’t care about rhymes,” 
she said. 

“This is called ‘The what-she- 
did.’ ” 

C’mell blushed all the way 
down to the neckline of her ca- 
pacious blouse. She had filled out 
a lot in middle age. Running the 
restaurant had helped. 

“Oh, that rhyme!” she said. “It’s 
silly.” 

“It says you were in love with 
a hominid.” 

“No,” she said. “I wasn’t.” Her 
green eyes, as beautiful as ever, 
stared deeply into his. Jestocost 
felt uncomfortable. This was get- 
ting personal. He liked political 
relationships; personal things 
made him uncomfortable. 

The light in the room shifted 
and her cat eyes blazed at him, 
she looked like the magical fire- 
haired girl he had known. 

“I wasn’t in love. You couldn’t 
call it that . .” 

Her heart cried out, It was you, 
it was you, it was you. 

“But the rhyme,” insisted Jest- 
ocost, “says it was a hominid. It 
wasn’t that Prins van de Schemer- 
ing?” / 

“Who was he?” C’mell asked 



THE BALLAD OF LOST C'MELL 



27 



the question quietly, but her 
emotions cried out, Darling, will 
you never, never know? 

“The strong man.” 

“Oh, him. I’ve forgotten him.” 
Jestocost rose from the table. 
“You’ve had a good life, C’mell. 
You’ve been a citizen, a commit- 
teewoman, a leader. And do you 
even know how many children 
you have had?” 

“Seventy-three,” she snapped 
at him. “Just because they’re mul- 
tiple doesn’t mean we don’t know 
them.” 

His playfulness left him. His 
face was grave, his voice kindly. 
“I meant no harm, C’mell.” 

He never knew that when he 
left she went back to the kitchen 
and cried for a while. It was Jest- 
ocost whom she had vainly loved 
ever since they had been com- 
rades, many long years ago. 

■ Even after she died, at the full 
age of five-score and three, he 
kept seeing her about the corri- 
dors and shafts of Earthport. 
Many of her great-granddaugh- 
ters looked just like her and sev- 
eral of them practised the girly- 
girl business with huge success. 

They were not half-slaves. 
They were citizens (reserved 
grade) and they had photopasses 
which protected their property, 
their identity and their rights. 
Jestocost was the godfather to 
them all; he was often embar- 
rassed when the most voluptuous 



creatures in the universe threw 
playful kisses at him. All he asked 
was fulfillment of his political 
passions, not his personal ones. 
He had always been in love, mad- 
ly in love — 

With justice itself. 

A T LAST, his own time came, 
and he knew that he was 
dying, and he was not sorry. He 
had had a wife, hundreds of years 
ago, and had loved her well; their 
children had passed into the gen- 
erations of man. 

In the ending, he wanted to 
know something, and he called to 
a nameless one (or to his succes- 
sor) far beneath the ground. He 
called with his mind till it was a 
scream. 

I have helped your people. 
“Yes,” came back the faintest 
of faraway whispers, inside his 
head. 

I am dying. I must know. Did 
she love me? 

“She went on without you, so 
much did she love you. She let 
you go, for your sake, not for hers. 
She really loved you. More than 
death. More than life. More than 
time. You will never be apart.” 
Never apart? 

“Not, not in the memory of 
man,” said the voice, and was then 
still. 

Jestocost lay back on his pillow 
and waited for the day to end.

INTO 
MY CELLAR 



^ ^H FORTNUM woke to 
Saturday’s commotions, and 
lay eyes shut, savoring each in its 
turn. 

Below, bacon in a skillet; Cyn- 
thia waking him with fine cook- 
ings instead of cries. 

Across the hall, Tom actually 
taking a shower. 

Far off in the bumble-bee 
dragon-fly light, whose voice was 
already damning the weather, 
the time, and the tides? Mrs. 
Goodbody? Yes. That Christian 
giantess, six foot tall with her 
shoes off, the gardener extraor- 
dinary, the octogenarian-dietitian 
and town philosopher. 

He rose, unhooked the screen 



and leaned out to hear her cry: 

“There! Take that! This’ll fix 
you! Hah!” 

“Happy Saturday, Mrs. Good- 
body!” 

The old woman froze in clouds 
of bug-spray pumped from an 
immense gun. 

“Nonsense!” she shouted. “With 
these fiends and pests to watch 
for?” 

“What kind this time?” called 
Fortnum. 

“I don’t want to shout it to the 
jaybirds, but — ” she glanced sus- 
piciously around — “what would 
you say if I told you I was the 
first line of defense concerning 
Flying Saucers?”

“Fine,” replied Fortnum. 
“There’ll be rockets between the 
worlds any year now.” 

“There already are!” She 
pumped, aiming the spray under 
the hedge. “There! Take that!” 

He pulled his head back in 
from the fresh day, somehow not 
as high-spirited as his first re- 
sponse had indicated. Poor soul, 
Mrs. Goodbody. Always the very 
essence of reason. And now what? 
Old age? 

The doorbell rang. 

TTE GRABBED his robe and 
was half down the stairs 
when he heard a voice say, 
“Special Delivery. Fortnum?” 
and saw Cynthia turn from the 
front door, a small packet in her 
hand. 

He put his hand out, but she 
shook her head. 

“Special Delivery Air-Mail for 
your son.” 

Tom was downstairs like a 
centipede. 

“Wow! That must be from the 
Great Bayou Novelty Green- 
house!” 

“I wish I were as excited about 
ordinary mail,” observed Fort- 
num. 

“Ordinary?!” Tom ripped the 
cord and paper wildly. “Don’t you 
read the back pages of Popular 
Mechanics? Well, here they are!” 

Everyone peered into the small 
open box. 



“Here,” said Fortnum, “what 
are?” 

“The Sylvan Glade Jumbo- 
Giant Guaranteed Growth Raise- 
Them-in-Y our - Cellar - f or - Big - 
Profit Mushrooms!” 

“Oh, of course,” said Fortnum. 
“How silly of me.” 

Cynthia squinted. “Those little 
teeny bits — ?” 

“Fabulous growth in 24 
hours,” Tom quoted from mem- 
ory. “Plant them in your own cel- 
lar — ’ ” 

Fortnum and wife exchanged 
glances. 

“Well,” she admitted, “it’s 
better than frogs and green- 
snakes.” 

“Sure is!” Tom ran. 

“Oh, Tom,” said Fortnum, 
lightly. 

Tom paused at the cellar 
door. 

“Tom,” said his father. “Next 
time, fourth class mail would do 
fine.” 

“Heck,” said Tom. “They 
must’ve made a mistake, thought 
I was some rich company. Air- 
mail special, who can afford 
that?” 

The cellar door slammed. 

Fortnum, bemused, scanned 
the wrapper a moment, then 
dropped it into the wastebasket. 
On his way to the kitchen, he 
opened the cellar door. 

Tom was already on his 
knees, digging with a handrake

in the dirt of the back part of the 
cellar. 

He felt his wife beside him, 
breathing softly, looking down 
into the cool dimness. 

“Those are mushrooms, I hope. 
Not . • toadstools?” 

Fortnum laughed. “Happy har- 
vest, farmer!” 

Tom glanced up and waved. 
Fortnum shut the door, took 
his wife’s arm, and walked her 
out to the kitchen, feeling fine. 

T OWARD NOON, Fortnum 
was driving toward the near- 
est market when he saw Roger 
Willis, a fellow Rotarian, and 
teacher of biology at the town 
high school, waving urgently 
from the sidewalk. 

Fortnum pulled his car up and 
opened the door. 

“Hi, Roger, .give you a lift?” 
Willis responded all too eager- 
ly, jumping in and slamming the 
door. 

“Just the man I want to see. 
I’ve put off calling for days. 
Could you play psychiatrist for 
five minutes, God help you?” 
Fortnum examined his friend 
for a moment as he drove quiet- 
ly on. 

“God help you, yes. Shoot.” 
Willis sat back and studied his 
fingernails. “Let’s just drive a 
moment. There. Okay. Here’s 
what I want to say: something’s 
wrong with the world.” 



Fortnum laughed easily. 
“Hasn’t there always been?” 

“No, no, I mean . something 
strange — something unseen — 
is happening.” 

“Mrs. Goodbody,” said Fort- 
num, half to himself, and stop- 
ped. 

“Mrs. Goodbody?” 

“This morning. Gave me a 
talk on flying saucers.” 

“No,” Willis bit the knuckle of 
his forefinger nervously. “Noth- 
ing like saucers. At least I don’t 
think. Tell me, what is intuition?” 
“The conscious recognition of 
something that’s been subcon- 
scious for a long time. But don’t 
quote this amateur psycholo- 
gist!” He laughed again. 

“Good, good!” Willis turned, 
his face lighting. He readjusted 
himself in the seat. “That’s it! 
Over a long period, things gather, 
right? All of a sudden, you have 
to spit, but you don’t remember 
saliva collecting. Your hands are 
dirty, but you don’t know how 
they got that way. Dust falls on 
you every day and you don’t feel 
it. But when you get enough dust 
collected up, there it is, you see 
and name it. That’s intuition, as 
far as I’m concerned. Well, what 
kind of dust has been falling on 
me? A few meteors in the sky at 
night? Funny weather just before 
dawn? I don’t know. Certain 
colors, smells, the way the house 
creaks at three in the morning? 



COME INTO MY CELLAR 



I

Hair prickling on my arms? All 
I know is, the damn dust has 
collected. Quite suddenly I 
know.” 

“Yes,” said Fortnum, disquiet- 
ed. “But what is it you know?” 

Willis looked at his hands in 
his lap. 

“I’m afraid. I’m not afraid. 
Then I’m afraid again, in the 
middle of the day. Doctor’s 
checked me. I’m A-l. No family 
problems. Joe’s a fine boy, a 
good son. Dorothy? She’s re- 
markable. With her, I’m not a- 
fraid of growing old or dying.” 

“Lucky man.” 

“But beyond my luck now. 
Scared stiff, really, for myself, 
my family; even, right now, for 
you.” 

“Me?” said Fortnum. 

HTHEY had stopped now by an 
empty lot near the market. 
There was a moment of great 
stillness, in which Fortnum turn- 
ed to survey his friend. Willis’ 
voice had suddenly made him 
cold. 

“I’m afraid for everybody,” 
said Willis. “Your friends, mine, 
and their friends, on out of sight. 
Pretty silly, eh?” 

Willis opened the door, got out 
and peered in at Fortnum. 
Fortnum felt he had to speak. 

“Well — what do we do about 
it?” 

Willis looked up at the sun 



burning blind in the great, re- 
mote sky. 

“Be aware,” he said, slowly. 
“Watch everything for a few 
days.” 

“Everything?” 

“We don’t use half what God 
gave us, ten per cent of the time. 
We ought to hear more, feel 
more, smell more, taste more. 
Maybe there’s something wrong 
with the way the wind blows 
these weeds there in the lot. May- 
be it’s the sun up on those tele- 
phone wires or the cicadas sing- 
ing in the elm trees. If only we 
could stop, look, listen, a few 
days, a few nights, and compare 
notes. Tell me to shut up then, 
and I will.” 

“Good enough,” said Fortnum, 
playing it lighter then he felt. 
“I’ll look around. But how do I 
know the thing I’m looking for 
when I see it?” 

Willis peered in at him sin- 
cerely. “You’ll know. You’ve got 
to know. Or we’re done for, all of 
us,” he said quietly. 

Fortnum shut the door, and 
didn’t know what to say. He felt 
a flush of embarrassment creep- 
ing up his face. Willis sensed 
this. 

“Hugh, do you think I’m — 
off my rocker?” 

“Nonsense!” said Fortnum, too 
quickly. “You’re just nervous, is 
all. You should take a couple of 
weeks off.”

Willis nodded. “See you Mon- 
day night?” 

“Any time. Drop around.” 

“I hope I will, Hugh. I really 
hope I will. 

Then Willis was gone, hurry- 
ing across the dry weed-grown 
lot, toward the side entrance of 
the market. 

Watching him go, Willis sud- 
denly did not want to move. He 
discovered that very slowly he 
was taking deep breaths, weigh- 
ing the silence. He licked his lips, 
tasting the salt. He looked at his 
arm on the door-sill, the sun- 
light burning the golden hairs. 
In the empty lot the wind moved 
all alone to itself. He leaned out 
to look at the sun which stared 
back with one massive stunning 
blow of intense power that made 
him jerk his head in. 

He exhaled. Then he laughed 
out loud. Then he drove away. 

I'T'HE lemonade glass was cool 
and deliciously sweaty. The 
ice made music inside the glass, 
and the lemonade was just sour 
enough, just sweet enough on his 
tongue. He sipped, he savored, he 
tilted back in the wicker rocking 
chair on the twilight front porch, 
his eyes closed. The crickets 
were Ghirping out on the lawn. 
Cynthia, knitting across from him 
on the porch, eyed him curious- 
ly. He could feel the pressure of 
her attention. 



“What are you up to?” she 
said at last. 

“Cynthia,” he said, “is your in- 
tuition in running order? Is this 
earthquake weather? Is the land 
going to sink? Will war be de- 
clared? Or is it only that our del- 
phinium will die of the blight?” 

“Hold on. Let me feel my 
bones.” ' 

He opened his eyes and 
watched Cynthia in turn clos- 
ing hers and sitting absolutely 
statue-still, her hands on her 
knees. Finally she shook her 
head and smiled. 

“No. No war declared. No land 
sinking. Not even a blight. Why?” 

“I’ve met a lot of Doom 
Talkers today. Well, two, any- 
way, and — ” 

The screen door burst wide. 
Fortnum’s body jerked as if he 
had been struck. “What!” 

Tom, a gardener’s wooden flat 
in his arms, stepped out on the 
porch. 

“Sorry,” he said. “What’s 
wrong, dad?” 

“Nothing.” Fortnum stood up, 
glad to be moving. “Is that the 
crop?” 

Tom moved foreward, eagerly. 
“Part of it. Boy, they’re doing 
great. In just seven hours, with 
lots of water, look how big the 
darn things are!” He set the flat 
on the table between his parents. 

The crop was indeed plentiful. 
Hundreds of small grayish brown

mushrooms were sprouting up in 
the damp soil. 

“I’ll be damned,” said Fort- 
num, impressed. 

Cynthia put out her hand to 
touch the flat, then took it away 
uneasily. 

“I hate to be a spoilsport, but 
. there’s no way for these to be 
anything else but mushrooms, is 
there?” 

Tom looked as if he had been 
insulted. “What do you think 
I’m going to feed you? Poison 
fungoids?” 

“That’s just it,” said Cynthia 
quickly. “How do you tell them 
apart?” 

“Eat ’em,” said Tom. “If you 
live, they’re mushrooms. If you 
drop dead — well!” 

He gave a great guffaw, which 
amused Fortnum, but only made 
his mother wince. She sat back 
in her chair. 

“I — I don’t like them,” she 
said. 

“Boy, oh, boy.” Tom seized the 
flat angrily. “When are we going 
to have the next Wet Blanket 
Sale in this house!?” 

He shuffled morosely away. 

“Tom — ” said Fortnum. 

“Never mind,” said Tom. 
“Everyone figures they’ll be ruin- 
ed by the boy entrepeneur. To 
heck with it!” 

Fortnum got inside just as 
Tom heaved the mushrooms, 
flat and all, down the cellar 

34 



stairs. He slammed the cellar ! 
door and ran angrily out the back 
door. 

Fortnum turned back to his 
wife, who, stricken, glanced away. 

“I’m sorry,” she said. “I don’t 
know why. I just had to say that j 
to Tom.” 

The phone rang. Fortnum 
brought the phone outside on its 1 
extension cord. 

“Hugh?” It was Dorothy ( 
Willis’ voice. She sounded sud- j 
denly very old and very frighten- 
ed. “Hugh . Roger isn’t there, | 
is he?” 

“Dorothy? No.” 

“He’s gone!” said Dorothy. 
“All his clothes were taken from 
the closet.” She began to cry 
softly. 

“Dorothy, hold on, I’ll be I 
there in a minute.” 

“You must help, oh, you must. 
Something’s happened to him, I 
know it,” she wailed. “Unless you I 
do something, we’ll never see him 
alive again.” 

Very slowly, he put the re- 
ceiver back on its hook, her voice 
weeping inside it. The night 
crickets, quite suddenly, were 
very loud. He felt the hairs, one 
by one, go up on the back of his I 
neck. 

Hair can’t do that, he thought. 
Silly, silly. It can’t do that, not 
in real life, it can’t! 

But, one by slow prickling one, 
his hair did.

T HE wire hangers were indeed 
empty. With a clatter, Fort- 
num shoved them aside and 
down along the rod, then turned 
and looked out of the closet at 
Dorothy Willis and her son Joe. 

“I was just walking by,” said 
Joe, “and saw the closet empty, 
all Dad’s clothes gone!” 

“Everything was fine,” said 
Dorothy. “We’ve had a wonder- 
ful life- I don’t understand it, I 
don’t, I don’t!” She began to cry 
again, putting her hands to her 
face. 

Fortnum stepped out of the 
closet. 

“You didn’t hear him leave the 
house?” 

“We were playing catch out 
front,” said Joe. “Dad said he had 
to go in for a minute. I went a- 
round back. Then — he was 
gone!” 

“He must have packed quick- 
ly and walked wherever he was 
going, so we wouldn’t hear a cab 
pull up in front of the house.” 
They were moving out through 
the hall now. 

“I’ll check the train depot and 
the airport.” Fortnum hesitated. 
“Dorothy, is there anything in 
Roger’s background — ” 

“It wasn’t insanity took him.” 
She hesitated. “I feel — some- 
how — he was kidnapped.” 
Fortnum shook his head. “It 
doesn’t seem reasonable he would 
arrange to pack, walk out of the 



house and go meet his alfr 
ductors.” 

Dorothy opened the door as if 
to let the night or the night wind 
move down the hall as she turn- 
ed to stare back through the 
rooms, her voice wandering. 

“No. Somehow they came into 
the house. Right in front of us, 
they stole him away.” 

And then: 

“. a terrible thing has hap- 
pened.” 

Fortnum stepped out into 
the night of crickets and rustling 
trees. The Doom Talkers, he 
thought, talking their Dooms. 
Mrs. Goodbody. Roger. And now 
Roger’s wife. Something terri- 
ble has happened. But what, in 
God’s name? And how? 

He looked from Dorothy to 
her son. Joe, blinking the wetness 
from his eyes, took a long time 
to turn, walk along the hall and 
stop, fingering the knob of the 
cellar door. 

Fortnum felt his eyelids 
twitch, his iris flex, as if he were 
snapping a picture of something 
he wanted to remember. 

Joe pulled the cellar door 
wide, stepped down out of sight, 
gone. The door tapped shut. 

Fortnum opened his mouth to 
speak, but Dorothy’s hand was 
taking his now, he had to look 
at her. 

“Please,” she said. “Find him 
for me.”

He kissed her cheek. “If it’s 
humanly possible . ” 

If it’s humanly possible. Good 
Lord, why had he picked those 
words? 

He walked off into the summer 
night. 

A GASP, an exhalation, a gasp, 
J -*-an exhalation, an asthmatic 
insuck, a vaporing sneeze. Some- 
one dying in the dark? No. 

Just Mrs. Goodbody, unseen 
beyond the hedge, working late, 
her hand-pump aimed, her bony 
elbow thrusting. The sick-sweet 
smell of bug-spray enveloped 
Fortnum heavily as he reached 
his house. 

“Mrs. Goodbody? Still at it?!” 

From the black hedge, her 
voice leapt: 

“Damn it, yes! Aphids, water- 
bugs, woodworms and now the 
marasmius oreades. Lord, it 
grows fast!” 

“What does?” 

“The marasmius oreades, of 
course! It’s me against them, and 
I intend to win. There! There! 
There!” 

He left the hedge, the gasping 
pump, the wheezing voice, and 
found his wife waiting for him on 
the porch almost as if she were 
going to take up where Dorothy 
had left off at her door a few 
minutes ago. 

Fortnum was about to speak, 
when a shadow moved inside. 



There was a creaking noise. A' 
knob rattled. 

Tom vanished into the base- 
ment. 

Fortnum felt as if someone 
had set off an explosion in his 
face. He reeled. Everything had 
the numbed familiarity of those : 
waking dreams where all motions j 
are remembered before they oc- j 
cur, all dialogue known before it j 
fell from the lips. 

He found himself staring at ’ 
the shut basement door. Cynthia ! 
took him inside, amused 

“What? Tom? Oh, I relented. I 
The darn mushrooms meant so I 
much to him. Besides, when he i 
threw them into the cellar, they I 
did nicely, just lying in the dirt.” 
“Did they?” Fortnum heard ' 
himself say. 

Cynthiq, took his arm. “What 
about Roger?” 

“He’s gone, yes.” 

“Men, men, men,” she said. 

“No, you’re wrong,” he said. “I 1 
saw Roger every day for the last 
ten years. When you know a man ' 
that well, you can tell how things 
are at home, whether things are j 
in the oven or the mixmaster. i 
Death hadn’t breathed down his l 
neck yet. He wasn’t running 
scared after his immortal youth, 
picking peaches in someone else’s 
orchards. No, no, I swear, I’d bet 
my last dollar on it, Roger — ” 
The doorbell rang behind him. j 
The delivery boy had come up

quietly onto the porch and was 
standing there with a telegram 
in his hand. 

“Fortnum?” 

Cynthia snapped on the hall 
light as he ripped the envelope 
open and smoothed it out for 
reading. 

“TRAVELING NEW OR- 
LEANS. THIS TELEGRAM 
POSSIBLE OFF-GUARD MO- 
MENT. YOU MUST REFUSE, 
REPEAT REFUSE, ALL 
SPECIAL DELIVERY PACK- 
AGES! ROGER.” 

Cynthia glanced up from the 
paper. 

“I don’t understand. What 
does he mean?” 

But Fortnum was already at 
the telephone, dialing swiftly, 
once. “Operator? The police, and 
hurry!” 

A T ten-fifteen that night, the 
phone rang for the sixth time 
during the evening. Fortnum got 
it, and immediately gasped. 
“Roger! Where are you?!” 

“Where am I, hell,” said Roger 
lightly, almost amused. “You 
know very well where I am. 
You’re responsible for this. I 
should be angry!” 

Cynthia, at his nod, had hur- 
ried to take the extension phone 
in the kitchen. When he heard 
the soft click, he went on. 

“Roger, I swear I don’t know. 

I got that telegram from you — ” 



“What telegram?” said Roger, 
jovially. “I sent no telegram. 
Now, of a sudden, the police 
come pouring onto the south- 
bound train, pull me off in some 
jerkwater, and I’m calling you to 
get them off my neck. Hugh, if 
this is some joke — ” 

“But, Roger, you just vanish- 
ed!” 

“On a business trip. If you 
can call that vanishing. I told 
Dorothy about this, and Joe.” 
“This is all very confusing, 
Roger. You’re in no danger? No- 
body’s blackmailing you, forc- 
ing you into this speech?” 

“I’m fine, healthy, free and un- 
afraid.” 

“But, Roger, your premoni- 
tions . ?” 

“Poppycock! Now, look, I’m 
being very good about this, 
aren’t I?” 

“Sure, Roger.” 

“Then play the good father 
and give me permission to go. 
Call Dorothy and tell her I’ll be 
back in five days. How could she 
have forgotten?” 

“She did, Roger. See you in 
five days, then?” ‘ 

“Five days, I swear.” 

The voice was indeed winning 
and warm, the old Roger again. 
Fortnum shook his head, more 
bewildered than before. 

“Roger,” he said, “this is the 
craziest day I’ve ever spent. 
You’re not running off from 



COME INTO MY CELLAR 



37 



Dorothy? Good Lord, you can 
tell me.” 

“I love her with all my heart. 
Now, here’s Lieutenant Parker of 
the Ridgetown police. Good-by, 
Hugh.” 

“Good — ” 

But the lieutenant was on the 
line, talking angrily. What had 
Fortnum meant putting them to 
this trouble? What was going on? 
Who did he think he was? Did or 
didn’t he want this so-called 
friend Lfcld or released? 

“Released,” Fortnum managed 
to say somewhere along the way, 
and hung up the phone and im- 
agined he heard a voice call all a- 
board and the massive thunder 
of the train leaving the station 
two hundred miles south in the 
somehow increasingly dark night. 

/^YNTHIA walked very slowly 
^ into the parlor. 

“I feel so foolish,” she said. 
“How do think I feel?” 

‘Who could have sent that tele- 
gram? And why?” 

He poured himself some scotch 
and stood in the middle of the 
room looking at it. 

“I’m glad Roger is all right,” 
his wife said, at last. 

“He isn’t,” said Fortnum. 

“But you just said — ” 

“I said nothing. After all, we 
couldn’t very well drag him off 
that train and truss him up and 
send him home, could we, if he 

38 



insisted he was okay? No. He 
sent that telegram, but he 
changed his mind after sending it. 
Why, why, why?” Fortnum paced 
the room, sipping the drink. ‘Why 
warn us against special delivery 
packages? The only package 
we’ve got this year which fits that 
description is the one Tom got 
this morning — ” His voice trailed 
off. 

Before he could move, Cynthia 
was at the wastepaper basket 
taking out the crumpled wrap- 
ping paper with the special-de- 
livery stamps on it. 

The postmark read: NEW 

ORLEANS, LA. 

Cynthia looked up from it. 
“New Orleans. Isn’t that where 
Roger is heading right now?” 

A doorknob rattled, a door 
opened and closed in Fortnum’s 
mind. Another doorknob rattled, 
another door swung wide and 
then shut. There was a smell of 
damp earth. 

He found his hand dialing the 
phone. After a long while, Dor- 
othy Willis answered at the other 
end. He could imagine her sitting 
alone in a house with too many 
lights on. He talked quietly with 
her awhile, then cleared his 
throat and said, “Dorothy, look. 
I know it sounds silly. Did any 
special delivery airmail packages 
arrive at your house the last few 
days?” 

Her voice was faint. “No.” 
GALAXY 






Then: “No, wait. Three days ago. 
But I thought you knew! All the 
boys on the block are going in 
for it.” 

Fortnum measured his words 
carefully. 

“Going in for what?” 

“But why ask?” she said. 
“There’s nothing wrong with 
raising mushrooms, is there?” 
Fortnum closed his eyes. 
“Hugh? Are you still there?” 
asked Dorothy. “I said: there’s 
nothing wrong with — ” 

“ — raising mushrooms?” said 
Fortnum, at last. “No. Nothing 
wrong. Nothing wrong.” 

And slowly he put down the 
phone. 

The curtains blew like veils of 
moonlight. The clock ticked. The 
after-midnight world flowed into 
and filled the bedroom. He heard 
Mrs. Goodbody’s clear voice on 
this morning’s air, a million years 
gone now. He heard Roger put- 
ting a cloud over the sun at noon. 
He heard the police damning him 
by phone from downstate. Then 
Roger’s voice again, with the lo- 
comotive thunder hurrying him 
away and away, fading. And fi- 
nally, Mrs. Goodbody’s voice be- 
hind the hedge: 

“Lord, it grows fast!” 

“What does?” 

“Marasmium oreades!” 

He snapped his eyes open. He 
sat up. 

Downstairs, a moment later, he 



flicked through the unabridged 
dictionary. 

His forefinger underlined the 
words: 

“Marasmius oreades: a mush- 
room commonly found on lawns 
in summer and early autumn.” 
He let the book fall shut. 

/"kUTSIDE, in the deep summer 
night, he lit a cigarette and 
smoked quietly. 

A meteor fell across space, 
burning itself out quickly. The 
trees rustled softly. 

The front door tapped shut. 
Cynthia moved toward him in 
her robe. 

“Can’t sleep?” 

“Too warm, I guess.” 

“It’s not warm.” 

“No,” he said, feeling his arms. 
“In fact, it’s cold.” He sucked on 
the cigarette twice, then, not 
looking at her, said, “Cynthia . 
What if . ?” He snorted and 
had to stop. “Well, what if Roger 
was right this morning? Mrs. 
Goodbody, what if she’s right, 
too? Something terrible is hap- 
pening. Like — well — ” he nodded 
at the sky and the million stars 
— “Earth being invaded by 
things from other worlds, may- 
be.” 

“Hugh!” 

“No, let me run wild.” 

“It’s quite obvious we’re not- 
being invaded or we’d notice.” 
“Let’s say we’ve only half- 



COME INTO MY CELLAR 



39 



noticed, become uneasy about 
something. What? How could we 
be invaded? By what means 
would creatures invade?” 

Cynthia looked at the sky and 
was about to try something when 
he interrupted. 

“No, not meteors or flying 
saucers. Not things we can see. 
What about bacteria? That comes 
from outer space, too, doesn’t it?” 

“I read once, yes — ” 

“Spores, seeds, pollens, viruses 
probably bombard our atmos- 
phere by the billions every second 
and have done so for millions of 
years. Right now we’re sitting out 
under an invisible rain. It falls 
all over the country, the cities, 
the towns, and right now . our 
lawn.” 

“ Out lawn?” 

“And Mrs. Goodbody’s. But 
people like her are always pulling 
weeds, spraying poison, kicking 
toadstools off their grass. It 
would be hard for any strange life 
form to survive in cities. Weath- 
er’s a problem, too. Best climate 
might be South: Alabama, Geor- 
gia, Louisiana. Back in the damp 
bayous, they could grow to a fine 
size.” 

But Cynthia was beginning to 
laugh now. 

“Oh, really, you don’t believe, 
do you, that this Great Bayou or 
Whatever Greenhouse Novelty 
Company that sent Tom his 
package is owned and operated 



by six foot tall mushrooms from 
another planet?” 

“If you put it that way, it 
sounds funny,” he admitted. 

“Funny! It’s hilarious!” She 
threw her head back deliciously. 

66/^OOD grief!” he cried, sud- 
denly irritated. “Some- 
thing’s going on! Mrs. Goodbody 
is rooting out and killing maras- 
mium oreades. What is maras- 
mium oreades? A certain kind of 
mushroom. Simultaneously, and 
I suppose you’ll call it coinci- 
dence, by special delivery, what 
arrives the same day? Mush- 
rooms for Tom! What else hap- 
pens? Roger fears he may soon 
cease to be! Within hours, he 
vanishes, then telegraphs us, 
warning us not to accept what? 
The special-delivery mushrooms 
for Tom! Has Roger’s son got a 
similar package in the last few 
days? He has! Where do the 
packages come from? New Or- 
leans! And where is Roger going 
when he vanishes? New Orleans! 
Do you see, Cynthia, do you see? 
I wouldn’t be upset if all these 
separate things didn’t lock to- 
gether! Roger, Tom, Joe, mush- 
rooms, Mrs. Goodbody, packages, 
destinations, everything in one 
pattern!” 

She was watching his face now, 
quieter, but still amused. “Don’t 
get angry.” 

“I’m not!” Fortnum almost 



40 



GALAXY 



shouted. And then he simply 
could not go on. He was afraid 
that if he did, he would find him- 
self shouting with laughter, too, 
and somehow he did not want 
that. He stared at the surround- 
ing houses up and down the block 
and thought of the dark cellars 
and the neighbor boys who read 
Popular Mechanics and sent 
their money in by the millions to 
raise the mushrooms hidden 
away. Just as he, when a boy, 
had mailed off for chemicals, 
seeds, turtles, numberless salves 
and sickish ointments. In how 
many million American homes to- 
night were billions of mushrooms 
rousing up under the ministrations 
of the innocent? 

“Hugh?” His wife was touching 
his arm now. “Mushrooms, even 
big ones, can’t think. They can’t 
move. They don’t have arms and 
legs. How could they run a mail- 
order service and ‘take over’ the 
world? Come on, now. Let’s look 
at your terrible fiends and mon- 
sters!” 

She pulled him toward the 
door. Inside, she headed for the 
cellar, but he stopped, shaking his 
head, a foolish smile shaping it- 
self somehow to his mouth. “No, 
no, I know what we’ll find. You 
win. The whole thing’s silly. 
Roger will be back next week 
and we’ll all get drunk together. 
Go on up to bed now and I’ll 
drink a glass of warm milk and be 



with you in a minute . well, a 
couple of minutes . .” 

“That’s better!” She kissed him 
on both cheeks, squeezed him and 
went away up the stairs. 

In the kitchen, he took out a 
glass, opened the refrigerator and 
was pouring the milk when he 
stopped suddenly. 

Near the front of the top shelf 
was a small yellow dish. It was 
not the dish that held his at- 
tention, however. It was what lay 
in the dish. 

The fresh-cut mushrooms. 

TTE MUST have stood there 
for half a minute, his breath 
frosting the refrigerated air, be- 
fore he reached out, took hold of 
the dish, sniffed it, felt the mush- 
rooms, then at last, carrying the 
dish, went out into the hall. He 
looked up the stairs, hearing Cyn- 
thia moving about in the bed- 
room, and was about to call up 
to her, “Cynthia, did you put 
these in the refrigerator!?” 

Then he stopped. He knew her 
answer. She had not. 

He put the dish of mushrooms 
on the newel-upright at the bot- 
tom of the stairs and stood look- 
ing at them. He imagined himself, 
in bed later, looking at the walls, 
the open windows, watching the 
moonlight sift patterns on the 
ceiling. He heard himself saying, 
Cynthia? And her answering, yes? 
And him saying, there is a way 



COME INTO MY CELLAR 



41 



for mushrooms to grow arms and 
legs . What? she would say, 
silly, silly man, what? And he 
would gather courage against her 
hilarious reaction and go on, what 
if a man wandered through the 
swamp picked the mushrooms, 
and ate them . ? 

No response from Cynthia. 

Once inside the man, would 
the mushrooms spread through 
his blood, take over every cell, 
and change the man from a man 
to a — Martian? Given this 
theory, would the mushroom need 
its own arms and legs? No, not 
when it could borrow people, live 
inside and become them. Roger 
ate mushrooms given him by his 
son. Roger became “something 
else.” He kidnaped himself. And 
in one last flash of sanity, of be- 
ing “himself” he telegraphed us, 
warning us not to accept the 
special-delivery mushrooms. The 
“Roger” that telephoned later was 
no longer Roger but a captive of 
what he had eaten! Doesn’t that 
figure, Cynthia? Doesn’t it, does- 
n’t it? 

No, said the imagined Cynthia, 
no, it doesn’t figure, no, no, no . 

There was the faintest whisper, 
rustle, stir from the cellar. Taking 
his eyes from the bowl, Fortnum 
walked to the cellar door and put 
his ear to it. 

“Tom?” 

No answer. 

“Tom, are you down there?” 



No answer. 

“Tom?” 

After a long while, Tom’s voice 
came up from below. 

“Yes, Dad?” 

“It’s after midnight,” said Fort- 
num, fighting to keep his voice 
from going high. “What are you 
doing down there?” 

No answer. 

“I said — ” 

“Tending to my crop,” said the 
boy at last, his voice cold and 
faint. 

“Well, get the hell out of there! 
You hear me!?” 

Silence. 

“Tom? Listen! Did you put 
some mushrooms in the refriger- 
ator tonight? If so, why?” 

Ten seconds must have ticked 
by before the boy replied from 
below. “For you and Mom to eat, 
of course.” 

Fortnum heard his heart mov- 
ing swiftly, and had to take three 
deep breaths before he could go 
on. 

“Tom? You didn’t . that is 
. you haven’t by any chance 
eaten some of the mushroom 
yourself, have you?” 

“Funny you ask that,” said 
Tom. “Yes. Tonight. On a sand- 
wich after supper. Why?” 

P'ORTNUM held to the door- 
A knob. Now it was his turn 
not to answer. He felt his knees 
beginning to melt and he fought 



42 



GALAXY 



t he whole silly senseless fool 
thing- No reason, he tried to say, 
but his lips wouldn’t move. 

“Dad?” called Tom softly from 
the cellar. “Come on down.” An- 
other pause. “I want you to see 
the harvest.” 

Fortnum felt the knob slip in 
his sweaty hand. The knob rat- 
tled. He gasped. * 

“Dad?” called Tom softly. 

Fortnum opened the door. 

The cellar was completely 
black below. 

He stretched his hand in toward 
the light switch. As if sensing 
this intrusion, from somewhere 
Tom said: 



“Don’t. Light’s bad for the 
mushrooms.” 

Fortnum took his hand off the 
switch. 

He swallowed. He looked back 
at the stair leading up to his wife. 
I suppose, he thought, I should 
go say good-by to Cynthia. But 
why should I think that! Why 
should I think that at all? No 
reason, is there? 

None. 

“Tom?” he said, affecting a 
jaunty air. “Ready or not, here 
I come!” 

And stepping down in dark- 
ness, he shut the door.

H elmut glorring, 

Commander-in-Chief of 
the TSS(E&D) Law- 
rence, Vice-Marshal in the Impe- 
rial Fleet, Primate Representa- 
tive of the Empire of Earth and 
the Protectorate, D.A.S. (Hon.), 
D.I.L. (Hon.), D.Lib.A. (Hon.), 
smiled and took the hand of 
Marine Captain Rink. He then 
turned, twisted, lifted and hurled 
Captain Rink over his head and 
into the wall. 



44 




The captain screamed, and 
when he rolled away from the 
wall his left arm was twisted. 

The assembled officers dutiful- 
ly cheered, beating their palms 
together. Glorring grinned and 
nodded, flexing his muscles as his 
two dressers hurried forward with 
towels and patted him dry. Rink, 
weaving a bit, got to his feet and 
staggered away to the infirmary. 

“Still the best,” muttered Glor- 
ring in satisfaction. 

The dressers chorused, “Yes, 
sir!” 

Still the best, he thought. The 
shape he was in, he could even 
take the Triumvirate, one at a 
time. But he knew better than to 
voice that thought aloud. He still 
wasn’t sure which of his officers 
was the Loyalty Sneak. 

As the last of them trailed out 
of the gym, headed for their du- 
ties in other parts of the ship, 
Chief Astrogator Koll came in, 
trailed by SSS Citizen Ehlen- 
burgh. “Sir,” said Koll, jabbing a 
thumb at Ehlenburgh, “the Scien- 
tist here says we’re passing near a 
Sol-star. He says the charts don’t 
list it, and it might have planets.” 

LORRING frowned. The 
Lawrence had been out from 
Earth over three years now. 
Seven Lost Colonies had been 
found and brought — forcibly, un- 
fortunately but unavoidably — 
back into the fold. And Glorring 

46 



had more or less decided to skip 
this time the token search for a 
habitable yet uninhabited planet 
which was, in the popular mind 
at home, the primary purpose for 
the Fleet. 

He was anxious to return to 
Earth — it wasn’t politically safe 
to be too long away. 

He turned to the Scientist. 
“How good are the chances?” he 
demanded. 

Ehlenburgh, a narrow elderly 
man in SSS gray, shrugged bony 
shoulders. “You can never tell. 
The star is of the right type, but 
in FTL it’s impossible to measure i 
anything as small as planetary 
mass. Statistically, our chances 
are good. On the other hand, there 
are such stars Without planets, or 
without planets on which humans 
can live. This may be one.” 

“In other words,” said Glorring, 
“you won’t make a definite state- 
ment one way or the other.” 

“I can’t,” Ehlenburgh told him. j 
“Not in FTL.” 

“If we’re going to stop,” said • 
Astrogator Koll, “we’ll have to do 
it within ten minutes, Excellency.” 

A commander must make his 
decisions rapidly and confidently. 
“We’ll stop,” said Glorring. With- 
out turning around, he barked, 
“Strull!” 

Captain Strull, adjutant, hur- 
ried forward and bowed. “Excel- 
lency.” 

“Staff in the Ready Room in 
GALAXY i 



ten minutes,” Glorring told him. 

“Very good, Excellency.” Strull 
bowed again and turned toward 
the door. 

“Strull!” 

The adjutant stopped, looking 
apprehensively at Glorring. “Ex- 
cellency?” 

Glorring studied the adjutant 
a long silent moment, raking him 
with his eyes. Strull was short, 
broad-framed, naturally prone to 
overweight. He had grown lax re- 
cently — was probably avoiding 
the exercise sessions in the gym 

and certainly hadn’t engaged in 

any wrestling matches for months 
now. His potential for fat had be- 
come kinetic. Strull bulged within 
his scarlet uniform, and his chin 
had multiplied. 

His voice deceptively soft, 
Glorring purred, “Just how much 
do you weigh, Strull, if you 
please?” 

“Excellency,” quavered Strull, 
“one hundred ninety pounds. If 
your Excellency pleases.” 

“You’re tat!” barked Glorring. 
“The men of the Fleet must be 
lean! Must be hard! Could you 
wrestle me, Strull, one bone- 
break?” 

“Oh, no, Excellency,” said 
Strull fearfully. “You are much 
stronger than I, Excellency.” 

“You have seven days to weigh 
one-sixty,” Glorring told him, “or 
I’ll have the excess carved from 
you and served to the enlisted 

THE EARTHMAN'S BURDE 



men for breakfast. Do I make 
myself clear?” 

“Quite clear, Excellency,” said 
Strull miserably. “Seven days, 
Excellency.” 

“I’ll be out for the briefing in 
ten minutes,” said Glorring. “I’ll 
want the staff ready.” 

“Yes, Excellency. Ten minutes, 
Excellency.” 

Strull bowed again, more deep- 
ly than before, and, maintaining 
the bow, backed out of the room. 

Glorring nodded in satisfaction 
and turned away, in search of a 
mirror. 

At decreasing multiples of the 
speed of light, the Lawrence ap- 
proached the Sol-star. On block 
one, in the most forward section 
of the ship, Glorring preened be- 
fore his mirror while the mutter- 
ing and helplessly indignant 
Strull padded about, rounding up 
the staff. On block four, the six 
gray-garbed members of the SSS 
— Scientific Survey Staff — 
checked their equipment and pre- 
pared for observation and meas- 
urement, or at least five of them 
did so. One, the psysociohistorian, 
named Cahann, had nothing to do 
in this situation. His field was 
human groupings, not the physi- 
cal universe of stars and planets. 
So Cahann, a thin and bitter man, 
sat morosely in his cubicle and 
thought his seditious thoughts. 
Below, on block six, the Marines 
made fast, preparing for the tran- 

N 47 



sition to normal speed. Among 
them was a twenty-year-old 
Spaceman Third named Elan, in- 
distinguishable from the rest. 

C AHANN hated the transitions 
to and from FTL. The mo- 
mentary feeling of bodilessness 
always upset him, irrationally 
frightening him, as though he 
were afraid each time that he 
wouldn’t come back together 
again. 

It happened as usual this time. 
Cahann, swallowing repeatedly 
and trying to ignore his nausea, 
reached for a book — any book — 
and tried to read. The other five 
Scientists, he knew, would be on 
their way up to the Ready Room 
now with their preliminary re- 
ports. He could go up with them 
and hear the news. But he was 
completely disinterested. This 
was not a Lost Colony for which 
they were stopping, and he was 
just as pleased. 

He enjoyed his work. But he 
hated its consequences. 

He longed for his pipe. Most of 
the time, he could get along some- 
how without it, but when faced 
with speed transition he sorely 
missed its warm comfort. 

Well, he reflected, at least this 
was an unpopulated system, and 
he could have no false hopes 
dashed by a weakling Colony. 
One would think, he told himself 
for the thousandth time, that at 



least one of the Lost Colonies 
would have advanced to the point 
where it could stand up to the 
Empire and defend itself. But it 
just didn’t work out that way. 

True, Earth had fallen back 
from the Old Empire into the bar- 
barism of the Dark Ages; but the 
records had still been there, wait- 
ing for men to be ready to use 
them again. And the colonies, at 
the time of the collapse of the Old 
Empire, had been small units, de- 
pendent on Earth for most of 
their technological knowledge 
and materiel. Only tiny areas of 
their worlds were tamed. In the 
time that Earth had rebuilt her 
Empire, the colonies had had to 
devote themselves to maintaining 
the shaky status quo on alien and 
often dangerous worlds, progres- 
sing only slowly. 

A brisk rap at the cubicle door 
was immediately followed by the 
head of Strull, saying, “His Excel- 
lency wants you in the Ready 
Room. At once.” 

Cahann looked up. “What for?” 
“Don’t question his Excellen- 
cy,” snapped Strull. 

“I’m not. I’m questioning you.” 
“And I’m not answering,” Strull 
told him triumphantly, and 
marched away down the corridor. 

Cahann surged out of his chair, 
knowing exactly what Strull in- 
tended to do next. He raced down 
the corridor, Strull trundling 
ahead of him, and managed to get 



48 



GALAXY 



to the elevator before Strull could 
close its door in his face. 

Cahann grinned. “You’ll have 
to take some of that tonnage off 
before you can outrace me, 
Strull,” he said. 

The barb seemed to strike far 
deeper than was warranted. Strull 
got red-faced and beetle-browed 
and sank into a burning silence. 
Cahann shrugged. 

The Ready Room was filled 
with an excited buzzing. Glorring 
in the savage splendor of his 
golden uniform, prowled across 
the room to Cahann, smirking 
happily. “Good news, Cahann!” 
he announced. “Not only a habit- 
able planet, but populated! 
There’ll be work for you. Sit 
down, and we’ll start the briefing.” 
He turned away, crying, “Ehlen- 
burgh!” 

Stunned, Cahann found a seat 
in the crowded Ready Room. He 
wondered if he’d heard aright. A 
populated world, not on the 
charts? Impossible! 

Unconsciously, his hand came 
up to his mouth, cupped as though 
holding a pipe-bowl, as he listened 
to the other Scientists describe 
the world this ambulatory boil 
had so unexpectedly discovered. 

TT sounded a strange world in- 
deed. Not physically, but in 
reference to the human popula- 
tion. Physically, it was nearly 
ideal. It was a rather close approx- 



imation of Earth. Somewhat less 
of it was under water, the climate 
was generally a few degrees 
warmer at all latitudes, and the 
oxygen content of the air was a 
trifle higher. Gravity was six per 
cent lighter, and in shape it was 
a bit more flattened at the poles. 
Its day was three minutes shorter 
than that of Earth, and its equator 
was an impassable jungle belt, de- 
void of settlements. 

All of the settlements, in fact, 
were in the northern hemisphere, 
in the middle latitudes. And it 
was here that the strangeness set 
in. 

These settlements showed no 
signs of civilization whatever. 

No use of artificial illumination 
at night had been sighted, nor 
were there evidently airships of 
any kind. The instruments had 
failed to detect any use of atomic 
energy. There were no metropoli- 
tan centers. And large segments 
of land were obviously in cultiva- 
tion, apparently for food . more 
primitive than which it was im- 
possible to imagine. 

A bucolic world, on the face of 
it. A primitive paradise which had 
reverted to a pre-civilized agricul- 
tural level. Pity they couldn’t 
have been left to stagnate in 
peace. 

Why the world had been left 
off the charts no one present 
could guess. The charts, carefully 
assembled, translated and trans-

cribed after the New Empire had 
been built up from the rubble of 
the Dark Ages following the col- 
lapse of the Old Empire, had al- 
ways been assumed to be correct. 
The Old Empire had burned it- 
self out in its attempt to seed the 
stars with humanity, finally bring- 
ing about its own collapse and the 
Dark Ages that had followed by 
so doing. And during those Dark 
Ages, contact with the far-flung 
colonies had been lost. It was only 
now, five hundred years after the 
dissolution of the Old Empire, 
that once again Earth was master 
of space. Now once again the Pro- 
tectorate was being expanded, 
and the Lost Colonies were being 
rediscovered and reintegrated in- 
to the Empire. 

The other five Scientists mono- 
toned slowly through their re- 
ports, and then Glorring turned 
inquisitively to Cahann. “You’ve 
heard,” he said. “What do you 
think? Are these people peaceful, 
or are they warlike?” 

Cahann shook his head. “I have 
no idea,” he said. “I can’t tell 
much about their social structure 
from what I’ve just heard. 
They’re pre-industrial, obviously, 
and it doesn’t seem as though 
their number can be very large. 
But we don’t have any records. 
We don’t know who founded the 
colony, how long ago, under what 
kind of charter, or with what sort 
of original population. In this situ- 



ation, there’s only one way for me 
to learn anything, and that’s to go 
down and take a look.” 

Glorring considered, his bullet 
head bowed in thought. At last, 
he said, “You have to see these 
natives in person, is that it?” 

Cahann nodded. 

“Very well. We will land near 
one of the larger settlements, and 
you will leave the ship. You will 
spend one hour studying the na- 
tives, and then you will return. If 
you have not returned in that 
time, we will make every effort to 
rescue you.” 

“Thank you,” murmured Ca- 
hann. 

Strull was suddenly active, 
whispering into His Excellency’s 
ear. Glorring nodded. 

“You will have an enlisted man 
with you,” he told Cahann. “To 
protect you,” he lied blandly. 

“Thank you,” said Cahann, 
deadpan, not looking at Strull. 

II 

T^LAN and Brent sat together 
in their cubicle on block six. 
They had felt the speed-transi- 
tion, and knew now that the ship 
was moving in normal speed. But 
that was all they knew. It didn’t 
seem as though they had come 
out of FTL for a Colony, since 
they hadn’t been put on battle 
standby, and of course conflicting 
rumors were spreading through- 



r out the block, and of course none 
of the Marines actually had any 
idea at all what was going on. All 
they could do now was wait. 

| Elan was using this time to 
good advantage, shining his com- 
bat boots. At twenty, he was tall 
and slender. Marine life had made 
him lean and physically hard. It 
had also taught him the knack of 
the impassive face, and it had 
trained him in patience. 

He had, like everyone else on 
Earth, been taken into the service 
on his sixteenth birthday. After 
one year of training and an addi- 
tional year of garrison duty on 
Earth, he had been assigned to 
the Lawrence for the rest of his 
twelve-year tour. 

He had had trouble adapting to 
the military life at first. Having 
been born and raised in the Adir- 
ondacks of North America, still 
the most backward area of Earth, 
the tight quarters which had 
seemed so natural to the men 
from more metropolitan regions 
had depressed him for a long 
while, though he had gradually 
grown used to them. 

Brent broke a rather lengthy 
silence between them by saying, 
“You never know. It might be a 
Lost Colony after all. I sure hope 
so.” 

“It might be,” said Elan non- 
commitally. He didn’t sound as 
pleased as Brent, but then he 
wasn’t a reconvert, and recon- 



THE EARTHMAN'S BURDE 



verts were always pleased, always 
happy. 

Reconvert: Former enemy im- 
pressed into the service to bring 
the force back up to strength after 
a military engagement. Surgical 
and psychological reconversion, 
taking five days, was necessary to 
make such a former enemy a will- 
ing and malleable Marine. There 
was, of course, a good deal lost in- 
sofar as initiative, intelligence and 
personality were concerned, but 
the remainder was a good Marine. 

“I sure hope it’s a Lost Colony,” 
said Brent. “I’d be glad to get 
back into action.” 

Elan looked at his friend. 
Brent’s squarish face had the 
bland smile and smooth com- 
plexion of the reconvert, and he 
sat stolidly on his bunk, body 
completely at rest. In the year 
and a half that Brent had been 
on the ship, Elan had never seen 
any other expression or any other 
emotion on Brent’s face. The re- 
converts could only be happy. 

A trace of wistfulness came into 
Elan’s voice: “You know, Brent, 
in a way you’re lucky.” 

“Sure I’m lucky,” said Brent, 
happily but without surprise. 
“Good ship, good outfit, good 
chow. And every once in a while 
a chance to see some good action.” 
“That isn’t what I meant,” said 
Elan. “I meant — ” he groped for 
words — “you don’t ever worry, 
ever feel sad or lonely or afraid.” 

N 51

GALAXY 



“Sure,” smiled Brent. “It’s a 
great life, Elan.” 

“I could volunteer,” said Elan 
softly, as though talking to him- 
self. “They’d reconvert me if I 
asked. But I’d lose an awful lot, 
wouldn’t I?” 

“Still be the same great outfit,” 
said Brent. “We’d still be here, 
buddy.” 

“But I wouldn’t be the same.” 
Elan looked down at himself, 
wearing off-duty uniform, and 
then gazed out the open side of 
the cubicle at the other Marines 
he could see. All alike, every one 
of them. Only the faces were dif- 
ferent. And even there the differ- 
ences were small, minimized by 
the deadpan encouraged by the 
officers. 

The thing that he had, that was 
him, that made him unique and 
different from anyone else — was 
there any real reason to keep it, if 
it only gave him pain? 

There was only one answer to 
that. While he gloomily studied 
it S/2nd Carr, the flight leader, 
stuck his head into the cubicle 
and barked, “Elan! Dress uniform 
on the double and report to Per- 
sonnel Hatch.” 

Elan looked up, astonished. 
“Sir?” 

“Don’t ask me, all I know is 
you’re going outside. On the 
double. No weapons.” 

“Outside,” said Elan. 

“Maybe there won’t be any 



fight,” said Brent, and it was 
clear that upset him, but he was 
still smiling happily. 

C AHANN leaned against the 
wall by the open personnel 
hatch, and pointedly ignored 
Strull. At the last moment, it had 
been decided to send the adjutant 
along. Neither one of them was 
happy about it. 

In a way, Cahann reflected, it 
didn’t matter whether Strull and 
the enlisted man came along or 
not. He could still make every 
effort to explain the situation to 
the natives, to try to avoid unnec- 
essary bloodshed, convince them 
that capitulation was their only 
defense. 

The enlisted men’s elevator 
slid open and the Marine who 
was to accompany them stepped 
out. Cahann glanced at him, 
recognized him as only one of the 
blank-faced enlisted men, and 
looked over at Strull. 

“Spaceman!” called Strull 
abruptly. 

The Marine marched rigidly 
over to stand in front of Strull 
and raise both hands high over 
his head in salute, parroting, 
“Spaceman Third Class Elan re- 
porting as ordered, sir.” 

Strull returned the salute half- 
heartedly, barely raising his 
hands above his shoulders. The 
Marine’s arms snapped down to 
his sides. Strull said, “You will 



52 



GALAXY 



accompany us, keeping your eyes 
open for any danger. You will 
speak only when spoken to or if 
necessary to give warning of dan- 
ger. You will not speak to any 
native under any circumstances. 
Is that clear?” 

“Yes, sir,” snapped the boy. 

“Very well. You will proceed. 
Cahann, second.” 

Of course, thought Cahann 
grimly. Inverse order of rank, 
when the probability of attack is 
unknown. 

The three of them went out 
and down the ramp, the Marine 
first in the dull gray of his dress 
uniform, Cahann second in the 
paler gray of his civilian garb, and 
Strull third, wearing his scarlet 
uniform. 

And the man at the foot of the 
ramp wore a white shirt and tan 
knee-length trousers and was 
barefooted. And smiling. 

Cahann stopped abruptly 
when he. saw the native, then 
started moving again, since the 
Marine was still descending 
ahead of him, and Strull was com- 
ing along in the rear. 

The Marine reached the foot of 
the ramp. 

The native stepped aside to 
allow him to pass. Then he 
stepped back into Cahann’s path 
and said, in perfect Terran, 
“Wondered when you people 
would make up your minds to 
land and come out of that silly 



tin can of yours. The name’s 
Harvey. Welcome to Cockaigne.” 

Cahann could only gape. Per- 
fect Terran? No variations at all 
in five hundred years? 

“Well, well, come along,” said 
Harvey with brisk cheeriness. 
“Got to meet the others, you 
know.” 

Strull pushed past Cahann and 
announced, “I am Adjutant Cap- 
tain Strull. I greet you on behalf 
of the Empire of Earth and the 
Protectorate, and on behalf of 
Vice-Marshal Helmut Glorring.” 

Harvey glanced at Strull, nod- 
ded, said, “Greetings yourself,” 
and turned away in obvious dis- 
missal. Linking his arm through 
Cahann’s, he said, “It’s just over 
this way. Come along.” 

Ill 

^TRULL marched along in 
^ growing indignation, stung by 
the native’s snub and impatient 
for a chance to do something 
about it. 

The ship had landed in the 
middle of a large squarish mead- 
ow, with forest backed up 
against low broad hills on three 
sides. The settlement — the larg- 
est one on the planet and still 
tiny by Earth standards — was on 
the fourth side. It was toward this 
settlement that they were walk- 
ing. 

The Settlement, when they 



THE EARTHMAN'S BURDEN 



53 



finally came to it, was certainly 
nothing to crow about, not in 
Strull’s considered opinion. It was 
about as primitive as one could 
get and still survive. There wasn’t 
even a transparent dome over the 
settlement. And these people 
were surely not advanced enough 
to have complete weather con- 
trol; which could only mean that 
they were, from time to time, 
actually rained upon! 

Strull glanced upward appre- 
hensively, wondering if anything 
of the kind were about to happen 
now. But the sky was clear blue, 
with only a few small fluffy 
clouds. Strull was pessimistically 
surprised. The way things were 
going today, he wouldn’t have 
been a bit surprised if he’d 
walked directly into a thunder- 
storm. 

Strull looked again at the set- 
tlement. Buildings of various sizes 
and shapes and colors — though 
none of them more than one story 
high — were spotted haphazardly 
here and there, with no order or 
precision to them at all. Nor was 
there any sort of pavement or 
streets, only narrow brown paths 
worn into the grass, leading hither 
and yon. 

“The meeting hall,” Strull 
heard the native say to Cahann, 
“is just over this way. We’re all 
anxious to get to know you people 
better.” 

When they arrived at the en- 
54 



trance of the meeting hall Strull 
said coldly, “All right, Cahann, 
I’ll take over.” He stepped ahead, 
following the native inside. 

There was just the one room 
within, and the walls were only 
the one thickness of planed lum- 
ber. At this latitude, it would 
never get cold enough to make 
more than that really necessary, 
though there was a rough stone 
fireplace in one wall. 

An amateurish platform, a foot 
high, was at the far end, with 
three small stools on it. Other 
stools were scattered here and 
there, not in rows or any sort of 
order at all. And people were sit- 
ting on them, dressed somewhat 
like the first native, though there 
was no uniform pattern to their 
clothing except its rustic simpli- 
city. 

The native led the way to the 
platform and turned to Strull to 
say, “I imagine you want to 
make some sort of speech now. 
Want me to introduce you? Or 
would you rather just begin on 
your own?” 

“I can handle it myself, thank 
you,” Strull told him, with frosty 
dignity. 

THHE native shrugged and went 
back to sit on one of the 
stools. Cahann was already seated 
on the second, and the enlisted 
man was glancing at the third as 
though he wasn’t quite sure 

GALAXY 



whether he should take it or not. 
Strull gave him a one-second 
glower, to let him know he 
shouldn’t, and then turned to the 
audience. 

“My name,” he boomed, “is 
Strull, Captain Adjutant to Vice- 
Marshal Glorring of the TSS 
(E&D) Lawrence. I greet you of 
the planet, uh — ” What the dick- 
ens had that native called this 
place? 

The native in question leaned 
forward to stage-whisper, “Cock- 
aigne.” 

“Cockaigne, yes. Thank you. I 
greet you, citizens of the planet 
Cockaigne, on behalf of the Em- 
pire of Earth and the Protector- 
ate, and additionally on behalf of 
Vice-Marshal Glorring, Primate 
Representative. I congratulate 
you on your rediscovery by the 
Empire of Earth and the Protec- 
torate, and I welcome you as a 
Confederated State in good stand- 
ing within the Protectorate and 
beneath the benign and omnipo- 
tent protection of the Empire of 
Earth.” 

Strull inhaled, having just bare- 
ly begun his speech, but he 
noticed that a bearded native to- 
ward the back of the room had 
risen to his feet and was waving 
a hand for attention. Strull 
frowned, paused, and in a lower* 
voice than previously said, “You 
had a question?” 

“That I did,” said the man. 

THE EARTHMAN'S BURDE 



While somewhat older and more 
hairy than the first native, he 
shared with him an identical ex- 
pression of lazy insolence. “I was 
just wondering,” he said, “how 
you can manage to rediscover us 
for your Empire when we were 
never a part of your Empire to 
begin with.” 

Strull allowed a smile of supe- 
rior knowledge to curve his lips. 
“Ah,” he said, “but you were in 
the Empire at one time, over five 
hundred years ago. I assume all 
records of a time that far back 
have been lost, but I can assure 
you that it is so. Surprising as it 
may seem to you, humanity is not 
native to this world. You are 
descendants of the original colo- 
nists sent here by the Old Empire, 
which collapsed five hundred 
years ago and which only now has 
been fully restored.” 

“Sorry,” said the native, not 
looking at all sorry, “but you’ve 
got your history a little confused. 
This world wasn’t settled five 
hundred years ago by the Old 
Empire, it was settled seven hun- 
dred years ago by the United 
States of America.” 

Strull had never heard the 
term. He blinked rapidly, saying, 
“What? What, what?” 

And that blasted Cahann 
spoke up, not bothering at all to 
hide his dislike for Strull. Didn’t 
he realize that they should show 
these yokels a united front? 

N 55 



C AHANN leaned forward to 
say, “Regional government 
on Earth. One of the last. 
There’ve been some indications in 
the old manuscripts that it did do 
some small-scale colonizing of its 
own, shortly before the Empire 
took over. We’ve always assumed 
that their efforts were unsuccess- 
ful.” 

“Nonsense,” said Strull. “Non- 
sense.” 

The bearded native shook his 
head. “Not at all,” he insisted. 
“We beat your Empire by a good 
two hundred years.” 

“This planet,” said Strull des- 
perately, “is part of the Protector- 
ate of the Empire of Earth, as of 
this moment, and that’s all there 
is to it! No questions!” 

“I’ve got a question anyway,” 
said a rather attractive young 
woman toward the front of the 
hall. “What if we don’t want to be 
part of your silly Empire?” 

“That,” Strull told her happily, 
on familiar ground again, “would 
be tantamount to revolution. 
And we would be regrettably 
forced to put down any revolu- 
tion.” 

“We certainly wouldn’t want 
that,” said the young woman. A 
number of the other natives 
nodded in agreement, but they all 
seemed to have faint smiles drift- 
ing about their lips, as though 
they thought the whole discussion 
rather funny. 



The native who had first met 
them got to his feet and said, 
“We’ll have to talk this over some, 
and decide what to do about you 
people. You can go on back to 
your tin can now. Tell your boss 
we’ll let him know our decision in 
a day or two.” 

Strull was just as pleased. He’d 
come, seen that the natives were 
anything but dangerous, had said 
his piece, and now he was more 
than ready to return to the ship. 
“Come along,” he said to Cahann 
and the enlisted man. 

“These two can stay here,” 
said the native. “We may have 
some questions to ask them.” 

“Definitely not!” cried Strull. 
There was no telling what a sedi- 
tionist like Cahann might say if 
left alone with these people. 

“They’ll be perfectly safe 
here,” said the native unnecessar- 
ily. “Go on back to the ship.” 

Well, in that case — “I will 
come back with his Excellency in 
an hour,” said Strull. 

He was halfway back to the 
ship before he began to wonder 
just what the dickens had hap- 
pened there. He hadn’t intended 
to leave Cahann and the enlisted 
man, not under any circum- 
stances. But the native had said 
something — he couldn’t precisely 
remember what any more — and 
for some reason that had seemed 
to change things. 

Why? He was somehow con- 



56 



GALAXY 



fused, he couldn’t for the life of 
him figure out exactly what had 
happened toward the end there. 

It was all that had happened 
to him today, that’s what it was. 
Glorring being such a nasty mar- 
tinet about his weight, and Ca- 
hann baiting him, and the native 
being so insolent, and all the rest 
of it. No wonder he was a little 
confused. 

But his face was still puckered 
in a bewildered frown as he con- 
tinued back to the ship. 



/^AHANN, baffled, watched the 
^ natives, who had burst into 
laughter the minute Strull left the 
hall. It was his job, as psysociohis- 
torian, to understand and categor- 
ize human societies, from the 
most complex industrial world to 
the smallest family group. Human 
social groupings, that was his sub- 
ject matter, seen in historical con- 
text, the sociologist’s what? com- 
plemented by the psychologist’s 
why? 

In essence, his job was even 
simpler than that. Every human 
grouping, from the smallest fam- 
ily to the largest industrial com- 
plex, had some sort of loophole in 
it, some spot for the Empire to 
insert itself and thus make the 
grouping at last only another part 
of the Empire. It was his job to 
find the loophole. He did the job 
well, because he enjoyed it in the 
abstract. He understood that he 



was making quite a large contri- 
bution to the Empire’s subjuga- 
tion of more and more human be- 
ings, but he didn’t suppose he had 
any choice in the matter. His 
work fascinated him, and he could 
only perform that work in the 
service of the Empire. His refusal 
to work would not have changed 
the course of events one iota. An- 
other psysociohistorian would 
simply have taken his place, leap- 
ing at the opportunity to get 
away for even a little while from 
the rigid anti-intellectualism of 
the college campus. 

Since he enjoyed his work, and 
since he had the curious facility to 
separate it from its end product, 
and since he was additionally a 
highly intelligent man, he was 
one of the best psysociohistorians 
in the business. He had pro- 
gressed to the point where his 
understanding of new societies 
and new cultures was so rapid as 
to be almost intuitive. 

This was the first time he had 
ever been baffled. 

All right, these people were not 
the descendants of Old Empire 
colonists, they were the descend- 
ants of even earlier colonists than 
that. But they were people, never- 
theless. They were an aggregate 
group. They should certainly have 
reacted in one of a limited num- 
ber of predictable ways. 

They hadn’t. 

Throughout his contact with 

* 



THE EARTHMAN'S BURDEN 



57 



them so far, they had behaved in 
no known manner whatsoever. 
Making fun of Strait — he liked to 
do that himself, but that was be- 
cause he knew the little blimp, 
and he hadn’t done it on first 
meeting him anyway — and acting 
as though the threat of the ship 
and its complement of Marines 
were no threat at all. And then 
all at once bursting into laughter 
for no reason that Cahann could 
see. 

r | ''HE laughter having finally 
subsided, Harvey came over 
to Cahann and said, “You have a 
lot of questions to ask. That’s only 
natural. Where do you want to 
begin?” 

“I’m not sure,” admitted Ca- 
hann. He looked at them, and 
they were all attentive now, more 
serious than they had been up to 
now. “I think I’d better begin 
with basics,” he said. “Govern- 
ment, for instance.” 

“Democratic anarchy,” said 
Harvey promptly. “The will of 
the minority.” He laughed at the 
expression on Cahann’s face. “Not 
what you’re thinking,” he said. 
“Not a ruling minority in your 
Empire sense.” He motioned at 
the others in the hall. “We’re a 
minority,” he said, “of the people 
on Cockaigne. Every settlement 
is a minority. If you disagree with 
us, you can go find a settlement 
where people agree with you. If 

« 



there is no such place, you can 
either change your thinking or be 
a hermit, it’s up to you.” 

‘What about criminals?” Ca- 
hann asked him. “What do you do 
with them?” 

“Hermits,” said Harvey suc- 
cinctly. 

“All right, what about money?” 
Harvey shook his head. “I 
know what you mean,” he said, 
“but we don’t use it. A society has 
to be more complex and sophisti- 
cated than ours to need money. 
Value symbols — and that’s what 
money is, after all — are usually 
the result of expanding travel, 
trade over larger and larger areas. 
We rarely travel, and we neither 
import nor export, so simple bar- 
ter is gOod enough for us.” 

“What about war between the 
settlements?” Cahann asked him. 

“None,” said Harvey. “Con- 
trolled population growth is a bet- 
ter answer. We don’t need more 
land than we have.” 

“You’ve never had a war?” 
“Never.” 

“So you don’t have much by 
way of military armaments.” 
“Nothing at all.” 

“Then why,” Cahann de- 
manded, “are you so sure you 
won’t be conquered by that ship- 
load of Marines out there?” 

That set them all laughing 
again, though Cahann couldn’t 
see that he’d said anything partic- 
ularly funny. He glanced at the

ana saw only me normal 
blank expression. The Marine 
waS staring straight ahead, at 

nothing- 

The laughter stopped abruptly, 
and Harvey said, “I’m sorry, Ca- 
hann. You don’t understand the 
situation here yet.” 

“I’m well aware of that,” said 
Cahann stiffly. 

‘You aren’t going to under- 
stand by asking questions,” Har- 
vey told him. He got to his feet 
and said, “I can show you more 
easily than I can explain to you. 
Do you want to come along with 
me?” 

Cahann hesitated, then stood. 
The Marine did likewise, but Har- 
vey said, ‘You stay here, Elan, 
if you please. Harriet there wants 
to talk to you while we’re gone.” 
He gestured at the young woman 
who had spoken to Strull, and 
who was now coming forward, 
smiling pleasantly. 

Cahann said hesitating, “I’m 
not sure — ” 

“ — you should separate?” fin- 
ished Harvey, smiling again. 
“Face it, Cahann, the two of you 
together with a roomful of us are 
no safer than you would be sepa- 
rated. Come along.” 

Cahann paused again, then 
shrugged and said, “You’re right.” 
With a backward glance at the 
Marine, whose expressionless face 
was beginning to crack under an 
onslaught of frightened bewilder- 



ment, he followed Harvey out of 
the meeting hall. 

Outside, Harvey gestured away 
to the right, deeper into the settle- 
ment. “This way,” he said. 

Something in the man’s tone, 
or in his expression, or perhaps 
just in the posture of his body, 
made Cahann suddenly appre- 
hensive. Just what was this he 
was walking into? 

“You want to know, don’t 
you?” Harvey asked him, chal- 
lenging him. 

“Yes,” said Cahann. “Yes, I 
want to know.” He stepped out 
firmly in the direction the other 
man had indicated.

"C'LAN was alone now, and 
scared out of his wits. The 
girl who’d been called Harriet 
came up on the platform, smiling 
at him in a useless attempt at 
reassurance. “Please don’t be 
frightened, Elan,” she said. “We 
just want to get to know you, 
that’s all.” 

He looked at them, too fright- 
ened at being alone to be able to 
read their expressions. 

Harriet sat down beside him. 
“Don’t be upset, Elan. Just talk 
to us. Tell us about yourself.” 

He mumbled, “I don’t know 
what to say.” 

“Tell us about your life on the 
ship,” she suggested. 



THE EARTHMAN'S BURDEN

His mind filled with memories 
of the rigid military discipline of 
the ship, but he knew better than 
to give information to potential 
enemies and so said only, “Life on 
the ship is just ordinary. Like gar- 
rison duty anywhere. That’s all.” 

Unexpectedly, that seemed to 
satisfy them, and the girl Harriet 
said, “Tell us about Earth, then. 
Tell us about your home on 
Earth.” 

Earth. Home! Oh, but that was 
something else again. His home 
section, peaceful and beautiful. 

Harriet said, surprise plain in 
her face and voice, “Is all of Earth 
like that?” 

He stared at her, and felt a 
moment of complete panic. He 
hadn’t said anything! 

She seemed to understand. 
She laughed, a bit shakily, and 
patted his hand. “Don’t go so 
goggle-eyed,” she told him. “The 
expression on your face told 
volumes. It’s clear you love your 
own home section, but what of the 
rest of Earth? Tell us about the 
big cities.” 

He made as though to rise. “I 
— I have to go back — ” 

“No, no, they’ll come for you. 
They said it was all right for you 
to stay here.” She held his hand, 
gazing at him with an expression 
he couldn’t define. “Little rabbit,” 
she said soothingly. “Poor little 
rabbit No one will frighten you 
any more.” 



LORRING had stripped down 
to loinpiece and was wres- 
tling with Chief Astrogator Koll 
when Strull returned. Seeing the 
adjutant enter the ready room, 
Glorring quit fooling around. He 
kneed the astrogator, kidney, 
punched him and gave him an 
elbow in the eye. Koll staggered 
back across the ready room, while 
the other officers shouted appreci- 
ation. Glorring signaled the end 
of the match. 

Immediately, his dressers came 
forward to towel him dry and put 
his golden uniform back on him. 

Glorring gazed bleakly at 
Strull. “Took you long enough,” 
he snapped. “Report.” 

“Yes, sir. We encountered the 
natives and — ” 

“Where’s Cahann?” Glorring 
interrupted. 

“I left him there,” said Strull 
promptly. “He — ” 

“You what?” 

“I left the enlisted man with 
him,” explained Strull. “There’s 
nothing to worry about, Excel- 
lency.” 

“Oh, there isn’t, eh?” Glorring 
couldn’t stand a weakling, and 
Strull was by far the weakest 
boob on the ship. It was about 
time, Glorring decided, to make a 
man out of that wart. “You go 
right on, Captain Strull,” he said. 
“You go right on and tell me all 
about it.” 

“Yes, sir,” said Strull briskly, 



60 



GALAXY 



n d then seemed to falter. He 
Rooked completely confused for a 
second, and then said, “Well, uh, 
aS I said, we encountered the 
natives. I spoke to a group of 
them in their meeting hall, telling 
them who we were and the pur- 



pose 



of our coming here. They 



claimed, by the way, that they 
w eren’t Old Empire colonists 
after all, but colonists from an 
even earlier time than that. I for- 
get the name of the government 
that sent them, but they claimed 
it was seven hundred years ago.” 
Koll, somewhat recovered, 
chimed in, “So that’s why they 
weren’t on the charts.” 

“It would seem so,” said Glor- 
ring. “Go on, Captain Strull. We 
haven’t come to the interesting 
part yet. The part where you left 
Cahann and the Marine and re- 
turned to the ship alone.” 

“Yes, sir.” Strull gnawed a low- 
er lip for a second, as though 
gathering his thoughts, and then 



went on in a rush. “Well, sir, after 
I spoke to these natives, I got sus- 
picious. They’re as backward a 
bunch as you’ll ever see. Not a 
bit of mechanization around them 
at all. But they talk as though 
they don’t even consider us a 
threat. Apparently, they feel as 
though they have some sort of 
secret weapon or something. So I 
ordered Cahann to stay behind, 
because he’s particularly qualified 
for that sort of thing, and see what 



he could find out from the natives. 
And I ordered the Marine to stay 
and keep an eye on Cahann.” 
“Brilliant,” said Glorring, with 
heavy sarcasm. “Absolutely bril- 
liant, Captain Strull.” 

“Of course,” said Strull hastily, 
“there was another reason, too. It 
was impossible in the short time I 
was there to get any idea of their 
system of government. And of 
course mine was just first contact, 
and I had no wish, your Excel- 
lency, to usurp your prerogative 
of direct negotiation with the 
local governmental leaders. So 
Cahann is to find out just who 
heads the local government and 
where he can be found, so you’ll 
be able to go directly to him when 
the time comes and not have to 
waste time asking directions of 
underlings.” 

Glorring raised an eyebrow. 
That made sense, surprisingly. Of 
course, Strull was only currying 
favor by doing this, but neverthe- 
less it was sensible for Glorring to 
be able to go directly to the local 
authority. “Very well,” he said. 
“You did better than I expected, 
Strull. Very good.” 

Strull bowed, relief plain on his 
face. “Thank you, Excellency.” 
“Very well,” said Glorring, to 
the room in general. “We will give 
Cahann an hour to find out all he 
can. In one hour, I shall leave the 
ship. We shall be escorted by one 
flight of Marines on foot, the 



THE EARTHMAN'S BURDEN 



61 



other three flights to be at com- 
bat-ready stations. One hour.” 

/^AHANN was in love. It had 
^ just happened. 

It was calling to him, because 
it loved him, and he went to it, 
because he returned that love, be- 
cause he loved it as much as it 
loved him, because to love it and 
to be loved by it was greater and 
more wonderful and more right 
than anything else in all of life. 

They had left the meeting hall, 
he and Harvey. They had walked, 
almost aimlessly, among the scat- 
tered unordered buildings of the 
•settlement and slowly it had 
grown upon him, this acquisition 
of love, this new understanding of 
the meaning and depth of love, 
this new completion which was 
possible only with the loved one, 
close to the loved one, blending 
with the loved one . 

It was in this direction. Not far 
away now, closer and closer. They 
had walked aimlessly, almost as 
though Harvey were allowing 
Cahann to choose his own direc- 
tion. Then Cahann had chosen 
his direction, and it was this way, 
this way toward love and toward 
fulfillment and toward comple- 
tion, this way toward It which 
desired him above all things. 

Before, just after they’d left the 
meeting hall, Cahann had been 
full of questions, had tried to ask 
them at once, but Harvey had 



raised a hand to stop him, saying, | 
“Not yet. I’ll answer all your 1 
questions, I promise that, but not 
just yet. Let me show you this! 
first.” 

“What is it?” Cahann had asked 
him. 

“I don’t think I could explain it 
to you,” Harvey had said. “When 
you see it, you’ll understand why. 
When you see it, you’ll under- 
stand a lot of things that are 
puzzling you now.” 

“This thing, whatever it is you 
want to show me,” Cahann had 
said, “this is what you think will 
protect you from the Empire, is 
that it?” 

“Not precisely,” Harvey had 
said. “Please, don’t try to guess. 
That won’t do any - good. Just 
come along. Once you’ve seen it, 
you’ll understand; and that will 
be that.” 

So they had fallen silent. And 
they had walked aimlessly, back 
and forth, and Cahann had just 
about come to the conclusion that 
he was being given a- runaround, 
that they were simply retracing 
their steps among the buildings of 
the settlement and not really get- 
ting anywhere at all, when the 
first faint touches of it had 
reached him. 

Desire. 

Love. 

Warmth and compassion and 
understanding. 

A need for him, for him and 



62 



GALAXY 



alone of all the creatures of 
^universe, all the creatures that 
had ever lived or ever would live, 
frt no one and nothing but him. 

It had come upon him almost 
annoticeably, like an aroma 
creeping into a room, and it is 
strong in the room before you 
even notice it. And so it was with 
this, it was only a faint unnoticed 

sensation until suddenly it had 

been there for a long time and 
had grown strong and was now 
all-pervasive in his mind. 

This way, it called. This way. 

A message of love, a message of 
desire and understanding and ful- 
fillment; and he had followed it,, 
he had turned in the path it had 
pointed out, and now Harvey 
trailed him, unnoticed and un- 
needed, and he hurried toward his 
beloved, who hungered for him. 

He felt like running, but there 
was really no reason to run. They 
would have all eternity together, 
now that they had found one an- 
other at last. And so he walked 
through the settlement, striding 
certainly forward, eyes bright 
with love and hope. He reached 
the last of the houses of the settle- 
ment and the edge of the woods 
beyond, and stepped unhesitat- 
ingly into the woods, for the loved 
one was in there, beckoning to 
him, calling for him, needing him. 

And Harvey trailed along be- 
hind him, two or three paces be- 
hind him. 



TTE was getting closer and 
closer, so close he could feel 
his skin tingling with anticipation, 
so close that the sweat broke out 
all over his body and his mouth 
hung open and his eyes stared for 
a sight of the beloved. 

And then, at last, he came to it, 
where it stood in its own small 
clearing. 

It was the head of Medusa, a 
thick green plant with many sinu- 
ous waving arms reaching up and 
out from the single stubby base, 
the whole nearly eight feet high 
and five feet in diameter. The 
rubbery green branches, or arms, 
swayed slowly, as though from a 
breeze, and at their tips were 
great scarlet flowers with thick 
petals, the flowers as big as a 
man’s head. The arms swayed vol- 
uptuously, and the petals of the 
flowers, which looked like great 
rough tongues, scraped together 
with a sound like the smacking of 
dry lips. 

This was It, the beloved, the 
purpose of all life. 

This was his destination and 
his ending and his fulfillment. 

For what greater purpose could 
any creature have than the satis- 
faction of the hungers of It? 

What was there in life more 
wonderful than the feeding of It? 

How grand and blessed and 
wonderful it was that he had been 
chosen, he of all the beings that 
lived and moved, he had been 



THE EARTHMAN'S BURDEN 



63 



chosen to give himself to the be- 
loved, to feed it and so to become 
a part of it forever. 

To throw himself at its base 
and give himself to its hunger. 

But as he stepped forward into 
the clearing, and the great scarlet 
flowers beckoned and bowed to 
him, he was suddenly stopped. 
Some petty creature was clutch- 
ing at him, trying to hold him 
back, trying to keep him from his 
proper completion. 

He pushed the creature aside. 
But it came back, and again, 
grabbing at him, clutching at him, 
pulling him away, keeping him 
always just out of reach of the 
beckoning scarlet flowers which 
hungered for him. 

And then more of the foul filthy 
creatures arrived and overpow- 
ered him. And though he fought 
against them, though It gave him 
the strength of fury and of love, 
he was borne down and back, car- 
ried bodily away from the clear- 
ing and away from the sight of his 
beloved. 

And still he fought, and the 
creatures dragged him back and 
back, out of the woods and among 
constructions which were of no 
moment to him, for the beloved 
was there, back there, still calling 
to him. 

And when at last he knew that 
it was hopeless, that the creatures 
were not going to release him 
ever, that he would never be able 



to complete himself at the base of 1 
his beloved, he shrieked with the ; 
torment of the greatest loss and '• 
the greatest sorrow that any be- , 
ing had ever known. He shrieked 
and shrieked, till one of the crea- 
tures struck him. And then black- 
ness rushed in, and he knew no \ 
more. 



V 

'T'HBY could read his mind! 

Every thought! 

Elan sat on the platform in ter- 
ror of his life. That was their 
secret, and he knew it now, and 
the nature of their secret was such 
that they must know he knew it. 

The girl Harriet’s slip when 
she had asked him to describe his 
home had been the first indica- 
tion, but it had seemed too fan- 
tastic to be believed, and he had 
chosen to accept her flimsy ex- 
cuse. 

But gradually, as the question- 
ing had gone on, he had seen that 
the people in the room were list- 
ening attentively not to the eva- 
sions and generalizations he was 
saying but to the truths he was 
thinking. The play of expression 
on an unguarded face, a look pass- 
ing between two people, things 
which could have been produced 
only by his thoughts, and not by 
his words. 

Until finally there just wasn’t 
any choice any more, there 




64 



GALAXY 



/ 

I 



weren’t any other possible an- 
swers. But still they played out 
the game with him, Harriet asking 
the questions and he stumbling 
through the useless answers. 

At one point, a kind of wave 
seemed to go through them all, 
they looking at one another with 
suddenly widened eyes, and five 
men at the back of the room got 
to their feet and hurried outside. 
He tried to recall what his 
thoughts had been at that second, 
but it didn’t seem as though their 
strange apprehension had any- 
thing to do with him. 

The scientist, Cahann? 

Harriet patted his hand again, 
saying, “Be easy, Elan. You have 
nothing to fear.” 

He stared at her. “You know 
what I’m thinking,” he whispered. 
“You’re reading my mind.” 

“Be easy, Elan,” she said softly. 
“Don’t always expect the worst of 
humanity. Not all of mankind has 
chosen the path of Earth.” 

Then they were silent. He 
looked from face to face, and 
knew that they were talking to 
one another without words, decid- 
ing what to do with him and with 
Cahann and with all the people 
on the ship. 

The silence was suddenly shat- 
tered by a shriek from outside the 
building, and a second shriek on 
the heels of the first. “Cahann!” 
he cried, leaping to his feet. Jump- 
ing from the platform, he raced 

66 



through the natives to the door 
and outside. 

He ran around the corner of 
the building, and stopped dead. 

A little distance away was the 
man named Harvey, and with 
him were the five men who had 
left the meeting hall so hurriedly 
a few minutes before. 

And at their feet lay the body 
of Cahann. 

r T , HE small band marching out 
from the ship in the sunlight 
looked hard and lean and impres- 
sive. In the lead, herculean in his 
golden uniform, marched Glor- 
ring. Directly behind him Strull, 
and next back two officers march- 
ing abreast, Majors Londin and 
Corse, respectively in green and 
black. Behind them, Captains 
Rink (his left arm in a sling) and 
Stimmel and Pleque, in blue and 
maroon and pale rose. Next, Lieu- 
tenants Braldor, Chip, Sassen, 
Kommel and Roll, in the multi- 
colored uniforms preferred by 
most junior officers. And, bring- 
ing up the rear, the flight of 
Marines in dress gray, S/lst Lor- 
etta two paces ahead of them and 
S/2nd Kallett at the head of the 
middle squad. 

There was no music, there were 
no flags. These were considered 
frills, and an Exploration & Dis- 
covery ship was notoriously de- 
void of frills. 

But they were impressive any- 
GALAXY 



r f " way- 
S rim 



The Marines looked deadly 
a nd the officers in their 
- . jj t colors hearkened back to 
the bright-plumed or feather-dec- 
orated or body-painted warriors 
of the dim past. These were the 
warriors of the Empire, respecting 
no one but themselves, desiring 
nothing but conquest, owing alle- 
giance only to the Empire which 
equipped them and sent them on 
their missions. 

Glorring, in the lead, breathed 
the sweet air and cast an eye of 
ownership over his world. 

And it was his world, much 
more so than any other Lost Col- 
ony he had bagged for the Em- 
pire. Here was a verdant globe, 
already stocked with colonists, its 
existence unsuspected at home. 

Glory came to the men who 
shepherded the stray Colonies 
back to the flock. How much more 
glory for the man who discovered 
a brand new stray! 

Perhaps he might bring a few 
specimens of the local colony 
back with him. Say ten of them. 
Unusual, of course, but this was 
an unusual world, an unknown 
world. Yes, he would bring ten of 
the natives back to Earth with 
him. 

As they came closer to the set- 
tlement, Glorring spied Cahann 
and the enlisted man, waiting 
near the closest of the buildings. 
They were too far away for the 
vice-marshal to be able to read 

THE EARTHMAN'S BURDEI 



their expressions, but he knew 
what they must be. Admiring en- 
vy on the part of Cahann. Mili- 
tary pride on the part of the 
Marine. 

And, on the faces of the group 
of natives waiting with them, 
could there be any expression pos- 
sible other than a wonderful awe? 

Beneath the silver skirts, he all 
at once executed a little hop, the 
time-honored method for chang- 
ing step. 

Simultaneously, all the march- 
ers behind him did exactly the 
same thing. 

He didn’t pay any attention to 
that at all. 

/^AHANN’S expression was 
^ somewhat greenish, but not 
with envy. It was more the green- 
ish tinge of seasickness. He had a 
lot to recover from. 

His memory of — the thing, it, 
the beloved, whatever it had been 
— was dim and blurred, and he 
had the feeling he didn’t want to 
remember it any more clearly 
than he did. 

There had been an urge, a com- 
pulsion, that had seemed at the 
time to be right and proper and 
natural, and that had also seemed 
to come from within, to be his 
own invention and own decision. 

He remembered the urge, re- 
membered with a shudder what 
the urge had been, even remem- 
bered to some extent the all-inclu- 

1 67 






sive compulsion of the thing.- But 
his memory was pedantic and un- 
real, as though he were remem- 
bering a particularly vicious tor- 
ture which he had never seen 
practiced on anyone but about 
which he had read graphic and 
detailed accounts. They were 
second-hand memories; he was 
buffered to some extent from 
their impact. 

On regaining consciousness, the 
first thing he had seen had been 
Harvey’s face, almost comically 
worried. And through a surrealis- 
tic damping, he had vaguely 
heard Harvey’s voice: 

“Cahann! Come out of it, Ca- 
hann, it’s all over! Come on, man, 
it’s over now, the thing doesn’t 
want you any more.” 

The last phrase had done it. He 
had sat bolt upright, prepared to 
scream, and Harvey’s hand had 
clapped tight to his mouth, hold- 
ing him rigid until the need to 
scream had passed. Then the 
hand had fallen away. Harvey, 
hunkered down beside him, said, 
“I’m sorry, Cahann, more sorry 
than you know. I hope you can 
forgive me.” 

“Forgive you?” Cahann raised 
a shaking hand to wipe his fore- 
head. “I don’t know yet what you 
did to me,” he confessed. 

“I had no idea,” Harvey told 
him, “just how strong the enticer 
could be for somebody who didn’t 
have any preparation. No wonder 



it killed so many in the first fe^l 
generations.” 

“What was it?” Cahann asked 
him. He felt stronger now, but his 
limbs ached as though he’d been 
tensing them too hard for too 
long. “What in time was it?” 
“Our ancestors called it ‘en- 
ticer,”’ Harvey told him. “When 
they came here, the plant infested 
the whole planet. There’s only a 
few left now, except around the 
jungle belt of the equator. We 
haven’t bothered to clean them 
out down there. We can’t use the 
land anyway, and their range isn’t 
very far.” 

“But what is it?” 

“It’s an enticer,” said Harvey. 
“It entices animal food, broad- 
casting a kind of telepathic beam 
that attracts anything that moves. 
We think the beam is connected 
with the flowers’ smell, but we’ve 
never proved it one way or the 
other.” 

“All right,” said Cahann shak- 
ily. “It got to me, so it does work. 
But why doesn’t it go after you 
people? Why only me?” 

“It does go after us,” Harvey 
told him. “It goes after every liv- 
ing thing that gets close enough.” 
“You mean you’ve built up re- 
sistance to it? I don’t see how you 
get the chance.” 

46TT doesn’t work quite that 
way.” Harvey seemed to 
consider for a moment, and then 



68 



GALAXY 



he said, “Have you ever heard of 
m ental telepathy?” 

“Of course.” 

“What do you think of it, as a 

possibility?” 

“j think it’s nonsense,” said 
Cahann promptly. So did Harvey, 
saying it right with him word for 



word. 

Cahann frowned. “What was 
that all about?” he asked, and 
Harvey asked the question in 
harmony with him. 

Cahann pondered, then nodded 
his head, saying, “Oh, I get it. But 
that doesn’t — ” He stopped, rath- 
er precipitately. Because every 
one of the twenty or twenty-five 
natives around him had been say- 
ing exactly the same words, in 
chorus with him. 

Harvey smiled slightly. “You 
think that doesn’t prove any- 
thing,” he said, “because those are 
the words you might have been 
expected to say. All right, say 
something unexpected.” 

Cahann looked at him, thinking 
furiously. He glanced at the en- 
listed man, who was gaping at 
everything with such a complete 
look of blank astonishment that 
Cahann at once felt better. At 
least there was one person present 
who was more baffled than he. 

Cahann gnawed on the inside of 
his cheek, trying to think. Telep- 
athy? The word was known, the 
field existed, but the researchers 
in the field were, so far as Cahann 



had ever known, exclusively 
crackpots and panacea-peddlers. 

Could the thing really exist? 
All he had to do was open his 
mouth and say one word, any 
word at all, and he would know. 

He wasn’t quite sure he wanted 
to know. 

Mind-readers. 

Peeping toms. 

No privacy at all. 

“It isn’t as bad as all that,” 
Harvey told him. “Shields do de- 
velop. Go ahead, say something.” 

Cahann took a deep breath and 
said: “Canteloupe!” 

Twenty-five voices bellowed it 
with him: “Canteloupe!” 

Harvey smiled. “Okay?” 

VI 

Z"' 1 AH ANN felt suddenly tired. 

Too much too soon. He 
wiped his forehead with his palm. 
He was still sitting on the ground, 
Harvey squatting beside him and 
the others, with the goggle-eyed 
Marine, standing around in front 
of him. He leaned forward, arms 
lax, and gazed bleakly at the 
ground between his knees. 

“All right,” he said dully. “Tell 
me about it.” 

“I don’t know what the coloni- 
zation methods of the Old Empire 
were,” Harvey told him, “but our 
ancestors were on a one-way 
street. They got on their ship, left 
Earth, traveled until they found a 



THE EARTHMAN'S BURDEN 



69 



place where they could land and 
live, and that was it. There was 
no contact with Earth, and no 
way to get back to Earth. Nor 
was there any way to leave their 
new home once they’d chosen it. 
The ship needed a complex 
launching pad they weren’t 
equipped to build. 

“So they came here,” he went 
on, motioning at the world around 
them. “They landed, stripped 
down the ship for parts, planted, 
started to build shelters . and 
then the enticer went to work on 
them.” 

“The way it did on me,” said 
Cahann. 

“Exactly. Now, here’s the point. 
Telepathic ability is dormant, to 
a greater or lesser extent, in every 
human being who ever lived. 
Back on Earth, there were count- 
less cases of individuals whose 
ability was advanced almost to 
the threshold of self-awareness. 
You see, the capability is greater 
in some people than in others. 
Just as some people have better 
memories than others, some are 
better at mathematics than 
others, and so on.” 

Cahann nodded. 

“To get back to the original set- 
tlers of Cockaigne,” said Harvey. 
“They were stranded here, five 
thousand of them. And they were 
being picked off by the enticer, 
which struck them telepathically, 
and below the level of conscious 



resistance. Do you see what that! 
meant?” 

“I think so,” said Cahann. “Jt 
meant that the people with the 
greatest telepathic capacity 
would be the ones most likely to 
survive. The ones who could 
catch what the enticer was doing ‘ 
in time to get back out of range.” ] 

“Of course,” said Harvey. “On 
this planet, for the first time i n 
man’s history, telepathic ability 
was the primary survival charac- 
teristic. This world forced man to 
breed for telepathy. The survivors 
of each generation were just a 
little bit more advanced toward 
full use of the ability than the 
generation before them.” 

“Until now,” Cahann finished 
for him, “you are all fully telep- 
athic.” 

“Exactly. And with, in addition, 
the complementary abilities that 
go along with it. Such as the 
shield. And such as, for instance — 
well, for instance, what’s your 
name?” 

He looked at Harvey blankly. 
Why ask that? 

“Come on,” said Harvey. “Tell 
me your name.” 

“My name’s . 

He didn’t know. He thought 
desperately, trying to remember, 
and it just wasn’t there. He didn’t 
know his own name! It was as 
though he had never had a name, 
as though a name had never been 
given him.

“Your name’s Cahann,” Harvey 
told him gently. 

Of course! How stupid to for- 
get it! 

Cahann looked sharply at Har- 
ve y, in sudden understanding. 
“You made me forget it.” 

Harvey nodded. 

It was as though a dull weight 
were pressing on Cahann’s soul, 
“js there no limit to what you 
people can do?” he asked. 

“There are limits,” Harvey 
told him, “but they’re nothing to 
worry about.” 

“What are you going to do with 

USr 

“We’ve been trying to decide. 
At first, when you’d just landed 
here, we thought the best thing to 
do was make you take off again at 
once, and give you the idea the 
planet was uninhabitable. It’s un- 
likely any other Earth ship will 
ever stumble across us.” 

“I wish you had done that,” 
Cahann told him. 

TTARVEY smiled. “You won’t 
when we’re finished with 
you,” he said. He motioned at the 
Marine, still goggle-eyed in the 
background. “See Elan there? 
He’s an intelligent boy. He’s also 
a latent telepath of a very high 
order. Harriet tells me she thinks 
she could bring the ability out 
completely in less than a year. 
But do you know what Earth has 
done to that boy?” 



Cahann looked. at the Marine, 
not understanding. He hadn’t ever 
really paid any attention to him, 
he was simply an impassive face 
and a uniform, one of the deper- 
sonalized enlisted men from block 
six. 

“Of course,” said Harvey. 
“That’s what you think of him. 
That’s what everybody thinks of 
him. They’ve told him so long 
and so often that he doesn’t count 
as a person, as an individual, that 
he believes it himself by now. Do 
you know that he has seriously 
considered requesting reconver- 
sion, to kill off the individuality 
which was only worthless and 
which brought him only self- 
doubt and worry? Do you know 
that four per cent of Earth’s 
Marines every year volunteer for 
reconversion? That’s how little 
life and individual worth have 
come to mean with you people.” 

“I didn’t know the figures,” 
said Cahann distractedly. He was 
gazing at the Marine, trying to 
see him as a person, trying to see 
him the way Harvey saw him. It 
wasn’t easy to do. 

“Your Empire,” Harvey told 
him, steel now coming into his 
voice, “is an open sore. It’s a gap- 
ing wound on the face of the uni- 
verse. We wouldn’t feel right if 
we let it go on,” 

“No,” said Cahann. “With all of 
your powers, you can’t do that. 
You can’t fight the Empire. One

But not the Empire.” 

“Don’t be so sure.” 

A native came strolling up at 
that point, casually saying, 
“Group of them forming outside 
the ship. They’re going to come 
this way.” 

“All right.” Harvey got to his 
feet, saying, “Come along, Ca- 
hann, We can talk while waiting 
for them.” 

Cahann stood up, awkwardly. 
He was stiff and aching in every 
joint. He limped along beside 
Harvey, the Marine and the other 
natives following. 

Harvey said, “We’re going to

this, but only temporarily. We’d 
rather not give the Empire any 
warning. Ten of us are going to 
go back to Earth with you people, 
on your ship.” 

“Ten of you? You can’t pos- 
sibly — ” 

“Don’t worry about it, Ca- 
hann,” said Harvey. “Your com- 
mander is deciding right now to 
bring us along.” 

They stopped at the edge of 
the meadow. In the distance, the 
procession was moving toward 
them. 

How pompous they looked! Ca- 
hann had never noticed that be- 
fore, how silly and pompous they 
all looked. Nor how completely 
defenseless. 

“You can do it,” he said in a 
low voice. He felt sick and fright- 
ened, but at the same time he 
was beginning to feel a kind of 
exultation. They would do it, 
they really would. 

And was there any doubt the 
Earth would be a better world 
when they were finished with 
what they would do to it? 

“Earth is out of step,” said 
Harvey, “out of step with life. 
Like this group coming toward us. 
They’re all out of step. We have 
to change that.” 

In the distance, the marching 
group all hopped at once, chang- 
ing step.

THE END OF THE JET AGE 

A FE W years ago Arthur C. 

Clarke, having flown into 
New York from the West Coast 
by sleeper plane, said to me: 
“When I woke up this morning it 
suddenly occurred to me that I 
belong to the only generation of 
men who will take a real sleeper 
plane. The generation before us 
did not fly and the generation 
after us will fly so fast that there 
won’t be any time for sleep.” 

It was a very interesting ob- 
servation, which was wrong only

in the respect of speaking of 
generations; it can all happen in 
the lifetime of one man. If some- 
body was born in 1900 he was 
walking around before anybody 
flew, except in balloons. This 
man might have flown in one of 
the early passenger planes which 
made it all the way from New 
York to Chicago in just a little 
over eight hours. He can now be 
flying in the Los Angeles-New 
York jet, which takes four hours 
and twenty minutes from lift-off 
in Los Angeles to touchdown on 
Idlewild airport. And the same 
man won’t be too old, say five or 
six years from now, to board the 
successor to the jets. 

The term “successor to the 
jets” must not be misunderstood. 
It does not mean that new types 
of transportation will make the 
jets disappear. Nothing ever 
seems to disappear completely. 
Soldiers not only carry bayonets 
but use them occasionally, 
whether there are transcontinen- 
tal missiles or not. 

r T''HERE are two foreseeable 
■*- types of devices which 
might be considered successors to 
the jets for passenger transporta- 
tion. One is the ramjet, now in 
use for the propulsion of several 
different missiles. The other is 
the passenger-carrying rocket. 
Since we do have winged mis- 
siles which use ramjets for pro- 



pulsion it would seem, at first 
glance, that the ramjet-powered 
passenger liner, flying at an aver- 
age of twice the speed of sound, 
would be closer to the present. In 
a manner of speaking it is, but 
there is a problem — which is 
either interesting or infuriating, 
depending on how you look at it 
— in the fact that a ramjet will 
not work unless it is moving with 
a fairly high speed. 

In the case of ramjet-powered 
missiles this is easily overcome 
by catapulting the missile into 
the air, either with a real cata- 
pult or else by the use of several 
high-power, short duration solid 
fuel rockets. As I said, this is 
being done with a missile; but 
when it comes to passenger carry- 
ing aircraft the passengers are 
likely to say something about 
this. In fact, the passenger’s 
strongest argument would be to 
say nothing at all and book pas- 
sage with another airline. 

But the takeoff is not the only 
problem. The landing is another 
one. When an airliner approaches 
the airport area its speed is very 
considerably reduced. The final 
approach to the runway is made 
at about the speed where the 
wings will still keep it airborne. 
If such a plane were ramjet-pro- 
pelled the ramjets just would 
not play any more. 

The best statement about this 
problem I have ever heard was 



given after a lecture at New York 
University, right after the war, 
by Air Commodore Whittle, the 
pjan who designed the first Brit- 
ish j et engines. When somebody 
f ro m the audience asked him 
whether he thought the then new 
ramjet might ever be used for 
piloted aircraft (the questioner 
probably had military aircraft in 
mind) Commodore Whittle said 
that as an engineer he considered 
this an interesting problem. “But 
as a pilot,” he continued, “I 
would hate to approach a runway 
with dead engines. This is the 
moment where I want to have all 
the power I might need — and if 
possible a little more.” 

Any ramjet-powered airliner 
would, therefore, need two sets of 
engines, adding turbojets for the 
take-off run and for getting the 
plane up to the speed it needs 
for the ramjets to take over. And 
the turbojets would be needed 
again for the landing. 

And whenever you approach 
an engineer with the request of 
designing an airplane for two dif- 
ferent sets of engines he will 
probably lean back as if in 
thought. He will be in thought, as 
a matter of fact, but he won’t 
think about the problem. He’ll 
think of a way of getting rid of 
you, and he may also consider 
whether there is anybody he dis- 
likes enough to recommend for 
this job. 



Even though a ramjet-powered 
airliner may look easier it is quite 
possible that a rocket-powered 
passenger liner is the more likely 
successor to today’s jets. Years 
ago Dr. Walter Dornberger and 
Krafft A. Ehricke designed such 
an airliner — or more precisely 
they thought about the problem 
of how it could be made to work. 
In principle, the flight of such a 
rocket-powered airliner would be 
the same as the flight of a ballistic 
missile (in other words: it would 
not be really a “flight” in the 
proper meaning of the word most 
of the time) but with a landing at 
the end instead of an impact. 
When I mentioned this possibility 
at the time, the reaction of the 
listener usually was that he would 
let anybody else use this device. 

But now, after successful 
manned orbits of the earth, the 
idea may slowly become more 
palatable. 

As the diagram (Fig. 1 ) shows, 
the rocket-propelled passenger 
liner would be a two-stage device. 
Both stages would have wings and 
both stages would be piloted. But 
the wings of both stages would 
be used mainly for the landing. 
The passengers would be in the 
second stage. 

r | ^AKEOFF would be vertical or 
almost vertical, with all eight 
rocket motors burning (five in 
the first stage and three in the

second stage) to produce a maxi- 
mum of thrust. But the three 
rocket motors of the second stage 
would not burn fuel from the 
tanks of the second stage during 
takeoff. They would take fuel 
from the first stage. The fuel sup- 
ply of the first stage would be 
nearly exhausted after 130 sec- 
onds. Then the two stages would 
separate. The large, but by then 
very light, first stage would drop 
behind the second stage . which 
keeps going, this time using its 
own fuel. The job of the pilot of 
the first stage would be to fly his 
stage on the momentum it has 
and ease it around so that it will 
return to the airport from which 
it took off. Possibly he might fly 
it to another conveniently locat- 
ed airport; but the ideal would 
be to return to the original air- 
port, so that the first stage, after 
inspection and refueling, can be 
used to push another second 
stage into its trajectory. 



The second stage would mean- 
while have gone into a ballistic 
trajectory, far flatter than the 
ballistic trajectories of missiles. 
The highest point of the flight 
would be around 28 miles up. It 
would actually be a flight in the 
upper stratosphere. For the sake 
of the passengers, one of the three 
rocket motors of the second stage 
would be kept burning at very 
much reduced thrust. The pur- 
pose is not to accelerate the ship 
any farther; the purpose is to 
spare the passengers from ex- 
periencing the zero-g condition, 
which is in itself harmless but 
might frighten inexperienced 
people. The low thrust of the 
rocket motor that is kept in op- 
eration would also help to over- 
come the residual air resistance 
which would still be encountered 
28 miles up. 

Each of the two stages would 
have some fuel left, to be used 
during the final approach to the 



M 51- O 1

^way for corrections and for 
an emergency pull-out in case a 
sudden obstruction appears on 
th e runway. 

The flying time from Los An- 
g e les to New York would be 
only a few minutes more than 
0 ne hour, or about one quarter of 
the time now needed by a turbo- 
jet. 

The real problem here is the 
question “will it pay?” in all its 
ramifications. Will it pay for 
enough passengers to make a cer- 
tain trip in one quarter of the 
time it normally takes them now? 
In the beginning the picture will 
no doubt be falsified by curiosity 
travelers, people who don’t have 
to make the trip but have the 
money to pay for the ticket and 
make the trip for the sole purpose 
of bragging about it afterwards. 
Now, whether it will pay for the 
“real” travelers to quarter the 
travel time will depend, in a large 
measure, on the price of the 
ticket. Obviously if the ticket 
price is only 20 per cent higher 
than the jet fare, the quartering 
of the travel time will pay for 
many more people than it will if 
the ticket price is, say, double the 
jet fare. 

The ticket price will depend, 
in turn, on the fuel consumption 
(and the price of the fuel) and 
on the number of trips a ship can 
make without needing a major 
overhaul. All these questions can- 



not be answered right now. The 
development cost of the ship it- 
self will be influenced by how 
much it will differ from ships 
which the government will have 
to develop for space operations 
such as the job of supplying the 
space station or, possibly, the 
servicing of very large communi- 
cations satellites. 

But passenger travel by rocket 
is possible. 

And it will come if the finan- 
cial problems can economically 
be solved. 

THE LIVING FOSSIL FROM 
CALIFORNIA. 

Let me point out first that I 
have nothing against readers who 
ask me questions. But I do feel 
pleased when, once in a while, a 
reader tells me something. And I 
am especially pleased when a 
reader, as in this case Dr. Pedro 
Wygodzinsky, tells me something 
which I, without his kind inter- 
vention, would almost certainly 
have missed. 

The case is the discovery of an 
insect which most certainly de- 
serves the designation “living 
fossil” in northern California. The 
specific place, geographically 
speaking, was the northern Cal- 
ifornia Coast Range in Mendo- 
cino County, near Piercy. The 
specific place, ecologically speak- 
ing, was under the decaying bark 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



77 



and in the rotten logs of fallen 
Douglas firs in this area. 

The small insect that turned 
up in the collections made by 
Dr. W. Gertsch and V. Roth 
would have been recognized, in 
a general way, even by many city 
people. A “silverfish” they would 
have said, probably wondering 
what a silverfish was doing in a 
forest. As far as they are con- 
cerned, silverfish turn up in little- 
used closets, in old-fashioned 
pantries and sometimes in books 
— old books, that is. The reason 
why the book must be old is that 
the modern plastic glues now 
used in bookbinding hold no at- 
traction for silverfish. They are 
interested in books bound with 
the aid of old-fashioned library 
paste, and in wallpaper stuck on 
with boiled flour paste. 

Now the silverfish which the 
city man would have recognized 
has the scientific name of Lepis- 
ma saccharins, given by old Car- 
olus Linnaeus himself. The first 
part of the name comes from the 
Greek lepisma, which means 
“scale” or else something that has 
scaled off. The second part of 
the name was to indicate that it 
loves sugar. Linnaeus probably 
was quite used to the spectacle of 
half a dozen silverfish darting off 
in as many directions when he 
reached for his sugar bowl. 

They are primitive insects that 
do not have wings and do not

nia. Photograph by Dr. Pedro Wygodzinsky. 



go through a metamorphosis. 
Their young look like the adults; 
they are merely smaller. The 
name of the order of insects to 
which the silverfish belong is 
Thysanura or Bristletails. A total 
of about 300 species is known and 
there are, of course, several fam- 
ilies. And to an expert who knows 
what to look for they do not look 
alike. 

When Dr. Wygodzinsky — 
who at the time was on leave 
from his normal position in the 
Department of Zoology, Univer- 
sity of Buenos Aires — looked at 
the insects brought back by Dr. 
Gertsch, he saw at once that they 
were Thysanura. But he also saw 
that they were not Lepisma but

belonged to a different group. He 
did not write me in so many 
words that he grew suspicious, 
but that must have been the case 
for he set out on a collecting trip 
of his own for additional specie 
mens. He was successful, too. 

It looked like a new genus. But 
there was something familiar. Dr. 
Wygodzinsky remembered what 
it was, an insect very closely re- 
lated to the one he had alive was 
known, but as a fossil. It was 
known as an inclusion in Baltic 
amber and had been described by 
F. Silvestri in 1912. The scien- 
tific name of the form preserved 
in amber became Lepidothrix, 
and the family of which it was the 
type was called Lepidotrichidae. 

But these were fossils from the 
early part of the Oligocene per- 
iod. The new insect from north- 
ern California was, therefore, a 
surviving representative of an 
otherwise extinct family of in- 
sects. It must be added here that, 
while the Thysanura as a whole 
are primitive insects, the Lepido- 
trichidae are the most archaic of 
the Thysanura. 

That a genus of these archaic 
insects should have survived at 
all is remarkable. That it was 
found alive in California, while 
the extinct relatives were found 
in East Prussia, is almost to be 
expected. Old forms of animal 
and plant life very often turn up 
in widely separated places. The 



best known example is that of 
our opossum, a marsupial. Mar- 
supials “normally” belong in 
Australia, but we have one in 
North America. The customary 
explanation for this phenomenon 
is that a group of animals (it ap- 
plies to plants, too, of course) 
will, at one time in its history, 
occur over a very wide range and 
possibly be of worldwide distri- 
bution. But then the climate 
turns unfavorable in one area. 
The animal type disappears from 
that area — not necessarily be- 
cause it is directly affected by 
the changing climate; it may be 
its food which disappears first. 
In another area natural enemies 
may become victorious, and as a 
consequence the type disappears 
from that area too. The final 
result is that the animal survives 
in a few spots . which might 
be at the extremes of its original 
range. 

The very fact that occurrence 
is so scattered means something 
to the expert. If one should learn 
that a certain animal type is 
found on one of the northern 
Japanese islands, near Cape Town 
and in southern Sweden it is safe 
to bet that this is likely to be 
an old form. 

That the new — or very old 
— insect from northern Califor- 
nia should have extinct relatives 
in the Baltic amber was quite 
logical. Zoologists speak about a

79 



“relic fauna” when they come 
across such a case. The scientific 
name given to the new discovery 
is Tricholepidion gertschi, the 
second part of the name honoring 
its discoverer. The insect is, like 
all Thysanura, not large. Its body 
measures 12 millimeters in length 
when fully grown. The antennae 
are nine millimeters long and the 
three caudal appendages 14 milli- 
meters. The total length, from the 
tip of the antennae to the tip of 
the appendages is, therefore, 35 
millimeters or about 1.4 inches. 

Of course there is no “practi- 
cal” value to the discovery. 

But there is a strange feeling 
of wonder that one finds around 
such a case. 

I don’t know how many people 
walk around in the forests of the 
California Coast Range. But even 
if it is not a place where hikers 
are common thousands of people 
must have wandered around 
there, completely unaware of 
what was hiding under the bark 
of the fallen logs on which they 
may have sat to rest. When hear- 
ing of such a case the next 
thought is always what else 
might be in hiding — or not even 
really hiding, but protected by 
not being recognized as some- 
thing unusual by most people. 
And the thought after that is that 
such a relic might easily become 
extinct without even having been 
“discovered.” 



QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 

In a recent issue you supplied 
a list of the earliest known and 
therefore presumably largest as- 
teroids. This list made me wonder 
about the nearest stars. I know, 
of course, that Alpha Centauri is 
the nearest star but it is not 
visible from New Jersey where I 
live. Which is the nearest star I 
can see from my home in New 
Jersey? 

Dorothy Steinfeld, 

East Orange, N. J. 



The nearest star you can see 
from New Jersey is the one com- 
monly known as the Sun. Alpha 
Centauri is only the second near- 
est star, after our sun. Having 
gotten this customary correction 
off my chest I can proceed to 
answer what you really meant. 
The nearest naked-eye star that 
can be seen from the northern 
hemisphere also happens to be 
the brightest: Sirius. It is very 
interesting that many of the 
brightest stars are quite a dis- 
tance away from us: Pollux 30 
light years, Capella 48 light years, 
Aldebaran 57 light years, Arc- 
turus 38 light years and Regulus 
80 light years. On the other hand 
the nearest stars are by no means 
the brightest, as the following 
table shows:

As you can see, only three 
(Alpha Centauri, Sirius and 
Procyon) of the eight nearest 
stars are even visible with the 
naked eye. But these three hap- 
pen to be quite bright. 

Please tell me why we need 
communications satellites. We 
have long-range radio, we have 
cables, we even have telephone 
cables. What can these communi- 
cations satellites do that radio, 
cables and telephone cables can- 
not do? 

Andrew Pessowski 
Chicago 51, 111. 

Offhand the communications 
satellites, especially the first 
series of them, will not be able 
to do anything that cables, es- 
pecially telephone cables, can not 
do. They can do better than long- 
range radio, which is sometimes 



disturbed by the cosmic events 
which are usually dubbed “mag- 
netic storms.” The wavelengths 
used by the satellites will not be 
subject to such disturbances. But 
even the first batch of “comsats,” 
as they are now called, will do 
something all businessmen are 
looking forward to. They will add 
new channels. Consider: if a New 
York company has a branch of- 
fice in London, or vice versa, their 
office hours overlap by just two 
hours. All business which con- 
cerns both must be transacted in 
these two hours, and everybody 
scrambles for this two-hour slot. 
If the English firm has a branch 
office in your city, Chicago, the 
office hour overlap will be just 
one hour. There is one more fac- 
tor which nobody mentions much 
because it is difficult to give fig- 
ures, but “comsats” will be cheap- 
en then additional cables. Besides 
cables don’t go everywhere. The 
satellite sliortwave does. 

I read just recently that some 
of our artificial satellites are ex-

this possible? Aren’t they all in-

they break up? Or has Roche’s 
limit been disproved?

that has been as much misunder- 
stood than “Roche’s Limit” and 
is as popular at the same time. 
I get an average of one letter per 
week which either asks about it 
or else quotes it. Roche’s limit is 
always interpreted to mean that 
no satellite can exist inside this 
limit which Edouard Roche, Pro- 
fessor of Mathematics at Mont- 
pellier, France, placed at 2.44 
planet radii, counting from the 
center of the planet. In the case 
of the earth this means that 



Roche’s limit is about 5700 miles 
from sea level. This means, j n 
turn, that all artificial satellites 
are well inside Roche’s limit. 
Then why don’t they break up, 
as reader Wallace asks? Awfully 
simple; Professor Roche specified 
that his “limit” applied to fluid 
satellites, satellites of zero tensile 
strength. Any solid body, like a 
large meteoroid, or any structure, 
like any artificial satellite, is not 
troubled by Roche’s limit at all.

With this issue GALAXY begins its thirteenth year, and as our birthday 
present to all of us we've lined up some old favorites among the authors to 
bring us new favorite stories. Next issue we have a novella by a fellow who 
has been with us since Volume 1 Number 1, and almost two dozen times 
since. The name is Fritz Leiber. The story is The Creature from Cleveland 
Depths. Like all of Leiber's best work, this one is bright and witty, with savage 
undertones. It has to do with shelters and cybernetics, but most of all it has 
to do with people — people who are capable of smashing themselves against 
their own dangerous ingenuity; people who can then pick up the pieces and 
build something better . people you will be glad to meet.

C ROUCHED in the ancient 
doorway like an animal 
peering out from his bur- 
row, Mr. Michaelson saw the 
native. 

At first he was startled, think- 
ing it might be someone else from 
the Earth settlement who had 
discovered the old city before 
him. Then he saw the glint of 
sun against the metallic skirt, and 
relaxed. 

He chuckled to himself, won- 
dering with amusement what a 
webfooted man was doing in an 
old dead city so far from his 
people. Some facts were known 
about the people of Alpha Cen- 
taurus II. They were not actually 
natives, he recalled. They were a

to its gods. Michaelson was

colony from the fifth planet of 
the system. They were a curious 
people. Some were highly intelli- 
gent, though uneducated. 

He decided to ignore the man 
for the moment. He was far down 
the ancient street, a mere speck 
against the sand. There would be 
plenty of time to wonder about 
him. 

He gazed out from his position 
at the complex variety of build- 
ings before him. Some were small, 
obviously homes. Others were 
huge with tall, frail spires stand- 
ing against the pale blue sky. 
Square buildings, ellipsoid, spher- 
oid. Beautiful, dream-stuff bridges 
connected tall, conical towers, 
bridges that still swung in the 
wind after half a million years. 
Late afternoon sunlight shone 
against ebony surfaces. The sands 
of many centuries had blown 
down the wide streets and filled 
the doorways. Desert plants grew 
from roofs of smaller buildings. 

Ignoring the native, Mr. 
Michaelson poked about among

the ruins happily, exclaiming to 
himself about some particular ar- 
tifact, marveling at its state of- 
preservation, holding it this way 
and that to catch the late after- 
noon sun, smiling, clucking glee- 
fully. He crawled over the rubble 
through old doorways half filled 
with the accumulation of ages. He 
dug experimentally in the sand 
with his hands, like a dog, under 
a roof that had weathered half a 
million years of rain and sun. 
Then he crawled out again, 
covered with dust and cobwebs. 

T HE native stood in the street 
less than a hundred feet 
away, waving his arms madly. 
“Mr. Earthgod” he cried. “It is 
sacred ground where you are 
trespassing!’* 

The archeologist smiled, watch- 
ing the man hurry closer. He was 
short, even for a native. Long 
gray hair hung to his shoulders, 
bobbing up and down as he 
walked. He wore no shoes. The 
toes of his webbed feet dragged in 
the sand, making a deep trail be- 
hind him. He was an old man. 

“You never told us about this 
old dead city,” Michaelson said, 
chidingly. “Shame on you. But 
never mind. I’ve found it now. 
Isn’t it beautiful?” 

“Yes, beautiful. You will leave 
now.” 

“Leave?” Michaelson asked, 
acting surprised as if the man 



were a child. “I just got here a * 
few hours ago.” 

“You must go.” 

“Why? Who are you?” 

“I am keeper of the city.” 
“You?” Michaelson laughed. 
Then, seeing how serious the 
native was, said, “What makes 
you think a dead city needs a 
keeper?” 

“The spirits may return.” 
Michaelson crawled out of the 
doorway and stood up. He 
brushed his trousers. He pointed. 
“See that wall? Built of some 
metal, I’d say, some alloy imper- 
vious to rust and wear.” 

“The spirits are angry.” 

“Notice the inscriptions? Wind 
has blown sand against them for 
eons, and rain and sleet. But their 
story is there, once we decipher 
it.” 

“Leave!” 

The native’s lined, weathered 
old face was working around the 
mouth in anger. Michaelson was 
almost sorry he had mocked him. 
He was deadly serious. 

“Look,” he said. “No spirits are 
ever coming back here. Don’t you 
know that? And even if they did, 
spirits care nothing for old cities 
half covered with sand and dirt.” 
He walked away from the old 
man, heading for another build- 
ing. The sun had already gone be- 
low the horizon, coloring the high 
clouds. He glanced backward. 
The webfoot was following. 

GALAXY 



“Mr. Earthgod!” the webfoot 
cried, so sharply that Michaelson 
stopped. “You must not touch, 
n0 t walk upon, not handle. Your 
step may destroy the home of 
some ancient spirit. Your breath 
may cause one iota of change and 
a spirit may lose his way in the 
darkness. Go quickly now, or be 
killed.” 

H E turned and walked off, not 
lookipg back. 

Michaelson stood in the an- 
cient street, tall, gaunt, feet 
planted wide, hands in pockets, 
watching the webfoot until he was 
out of sight beyond a huge circu- 
lar building. There was a man 
to watch. There was one of the 
intelligent ones. One look into the 
alert old eyes had told him that. 

Michaelson shook his head, 
and went about satisfying his 
curiosity. He entered buildings 
without thought of roofs falling 
in, or decayed floors dropping 
from under his weight. He began 
to collect small items, making a 
pile of them in the street. An 
ancient bowl, metal untouched by 
the ages. A statue of a man, one 
foot high, correct to the minutest 
detail, showing how identical 
they had been to Earthmen. He 
found books still standing on 
ancient shelves but was afraid to 
touch them without tools. 

Darkness came swiftly and he 
was forced out into the street. 



He stood there alone feeling 
the age of the place. Even the 
smell of age was in the air. Silver 
moonlight from the two moons 
filtered through clear air down 
upon the ruins. The city lay now 
in darkness, dead and still, wait- 
ing for morning so it could lie 
dead and still in the sun. 

There was no hurry to be going 
home, although he was alone, al- 
though this was Alpha Centaurus 
II with many unknowns, many 
dangers . although home was 
a very great distance away. There 
was no one back there to worry 
about him. 

His wife had died many years 
ago back on Earth. No children. 
His friends in the settlement 
would not look for him for anoth- 
er day at least. Anyway, the tiny 
cylinder, buried in flesh behind 
his ear, a thing of mystery and 
immense power, could take him 
home instantly, without effort 
save a flicker of thought. 

“You did not leave, as I asked 
you.” 

Michaelson whirled around at 
the sound of the native’s voice. 
Then he relaxed. He said, “You 
shouldn’t sneak up on a man like 
that.” 

“You must leave, or I will be 
forced to kill you. I do not want 
to kill you, but if I must . .” He 
made a clucking sound deep in 
the throat. “The spirits are angry.” 

“Nonsense, Superstition! But

never mind. You have been here 
longer than I. Tell me, what are 
those instruments in the rooms? 
It looks like a clock but I’m cer- 
tain it had some other function.” 
“What rooms?” 

“Oh, come now. The small 
rooms back there. Look like they 
were bedrooms.” 

“I do not know.” The webfoot 
drew closer. Michaelson decided 
he was sixty or seventy years old, 
at least. 

“You’ve been here a long time. 
You are intelligent, and you must 
be educated, the way you talk. 
That gadget looks like a time- 
piece of some sort. What is it? 
What does it measure?” 

“I insist that you go.” The web- 
foot held something in his hand. 

“No.” Michaelson looked off 
down the street, trying to ignore 
the native, trying to feel the life 
of the city as it might have been. 

UV^OU ARE sensitive,” the 
native said in his ear. “It 
takes a sensitive god to feel the 
spirits moving in the houses and 
walking in these old streets.” 
“Say it any way you want to. 
This is the most fascinating thing 
I’ve ever seen. The Inca’s treas- 
ure, the ruins of Pompeii, Egyp- 
tian tombs — none can hold a 
candle to this.” 

“Mr. Earthgod . .” 

“Don’t call me that. I’m not a 
god, and you know it.” 



The old man shrugged. “It ; s 
not an item worthy of dispute 
Those names you mention, are 
they the names of gods?” 

He chuckled. “In a way, y es 
What is your name?” 

“Maota.” 

“You must help me, Maota, 
These things must be preserved. 
We’ll build a museum, right here 
in the street. No, over there on 
the hill just outside the city. We’ll 
collect all the old writings and 
perhaps we may decipher them. 
Think of it, Maota! To read pages 
written so long ago and think 
their thoughts. We’ll put every- 
thing under glass. Build and 
evacuate chambers to stop the 
decay. Catalogue, itemize . .” 
Michaelson was warming up to 
his subject, but Maota shook his 
head like a waving palm frond 
and stamped his feet. 

“You will leave now.” 

“Can’t you see? Look at the 
decay. These things are priceless. 
They must be preserved. Future 
generations will thank us.” 

“Do you mean,” the old man 
asked, aghast, “that you want 
others to come here? You know 
the city abhors the sound of alien 
voices. Those who lived here may 
return one day! They must not 
find their city packaged and pre- 
served and laid out on shelves for 
the curious to breathe their foul 
breaths upon. You will leave. 
Now!”

GALAXY 



‘‘N°” Michaelson was adamant. 
|<}, e rock of Gibraltar. 

Maota hit him, quickly, pas- 
sionately, and dropped the weap- 
on beside his body. He turned 
swiftly, making a swirling mark 
in the sand with his heel, and 
walked off toward the hills out- 
side the city. 

The weapon he had used was 
a n ancient book. Its paper-thin 
pages rustled in the wind as if an 
unseen hand turned them, read- 
ing, while Michaelson’s blood 
trickled out from the head wound 
upon the ancient street. 

YJ7HEN he regained conscious- 
ness the two moons, bright 
sentinel orbs in the night sky, had 
moved to a new position down 
their sliding path. Old Maota’s 
absence took some of the weird- 
ness and fantasy away. It seemed 
a more practical place now. 

The gash in his head was pain- 
ful, throbbing with quick, short 
hammer-blows synchronized with 
his heart beats. But there was a 
new determination in him. If it 
was a fight that the old webfooted 
fool wanted, a fight he would get. 
The cylinder flicked him, at his 
command, across five hundred 
miles of desert and rocks to a 
small creek he remembered. Here 
he bathed his head in cool water 
until all the caked blood was dis- 
solved from his hair. Feeling bet- 
ter, he went back. 



The wind had turned cool. 
Michaelson shivered, wishing he 
had brought a coat. The city was 
absolutely still except for small 
gusts of wind sighing through the 
frail spires. The ancient book still 
lay in the sand beside the dark 
spot of blood. He stooped over 
and picked it up. 

It was light, much lighter than 
most Earth books. He ran a hand 
over the binding. Smooth it was, 
untouched by time or climate. He 
squinted at the pages, tilting the 
book to catch the bright moon- 
light, but the writing was alien. 
He touched the page, ran his fore- 
finger over the writing. 

Suddenly he sprang back. The 
book fell from his hands. 

“God. in heaven!” he exclaimed. 

He had heard a voice. He 
looked around at the old build- 
ings, down the length of the an- 
cient street. Something strange 
about the voice. Not Maota. Not 
his tones. Not his words. Satisfied 
that no one was near, he stooped 
and picked up the book again. 

“Good God!” he said aloud. It 
was the book talking. His fingers 
had touched the writing again. It 
was not a voice, exactly, but a 
stirring in his mind, like a strange 
language heard for the first time. 

A talking book. What other sur- 
prises were in the city? Tall, 
fragile buildings laughing at time 
and weather. A clock measuring 
God-knows-what. If such wonders 



A CITY NEAR CENTAURUS

remained, what about those al- 
ready destroyed? One could only 
guess at the machines, the gad- 
gets, the artistry already decayed 
and blown away to mix forever 
with the sand. 

I must preserve it, he thought, 
whether Maota likes it or not. 
They say these people lived half a 
million years ago. A long time. 
Let’s see, now. A man lives one 
hundred years on the average. 
Five thousand lifetimes. 

And all you do is touch a book, 
and a voice jumps across all those 
years! 

He started off toward the tall 
building he had examined upon 
discovery of the city. His left eye- 
lid began to twitch and he laid his 
forefinger against the eye, press- 
ing until it stopped. Then he 
stooped and entered the building. 
He laid the book down and tried 
to take the “clock” off the wall. 
It was dark in the building and 
his fingers felt along the wall, 
looking for it. Then he touched 
it. His fingers moved over its 
smooth surface. Then suddenly 
he jerked his hand back with an 
exclamation of amazement. Fear 
ran up his spine. 

The clock was warm. 

He felt like running, like flick- 
ing back to the settlement where 
there were people and familiar 
voics, for here was a thing that 
should not be. Half a million 
years — and here was warmth! 



He touched it again, curiosity 
overwhelming his fear. It was 
warm. No mistake. And there was 
a faint vibration, a suggestion of 
power. He stood there in the dark- 
ness staring off into the darkness, 
trembling. Fear built up in him 
until it was a monstrous thing, 
drowning reason. He forgot the 
power of the cylinder behind his 
ear. He scrambled through the 
doorway. He got up and ran down 
the ancient sandy street until he 
came to the edge of the city. Here 
he stopped, gasping for air, feel- 
ing the pain throb in his head. 

Common sense said that he 
should go home, that nothing 
worthwhile could be accomplished 
at night, that he was tired, that 
he was weak from loss of blood 
and fright and running. But when 
Michaelson was on the trail of 
important discoveries he had no 
common sense. 

He sat down in the darkness, 
meaning to rest a moment. 

%W7"HEN he awoke dawn was 
^ ’ red against thin clouds in 
the east. 

Old Maota stood in the street 
with webbed feet planted far 
apart in the sand, a weapon in the 
crook of his arm. It was a long 
tube affair, familiar to Michael- 
son. 

Michaelson asked, “Did you 
sleep well?” 

“No.” 



88 



GALAXY 



«I’m sorry to hear that.” 
“How do you feel?” 
“Fine, but my head 






little.” 

“Sorry,” Maota said. 

“For what?” 

“For hitting you. Pain is not 



for gods like you.” 

Michaelson relaxed somewhat. 
“What kind of man are you? First 
you try to break my skull, then 
you apologize.” 

“I abhor pain. I should have 
killed you outright.” 

He thought about that for a 
moment, eyeing the weapon. 

It looked in good working 
order. Slim and shiny and inno- 
cent, it looked like a glorified 
African blowgun. But he was not 
deceived by its appearance. It 
was a deadly weapon. 

“Well,” he said, “before you kill 
me, tell me about the book.” He 
held it up for Maota to see. 
“What about the book?” 

“What kind of book is it?” 
“What does Mr. Earthgod 
mean, what kind of book? You 
have seen it. It is like any other 
book, except for the material and 
the fact that it talks.” 

“No, no. I mean, what’s in it?” 
“Poetry.” 

“Poetry? For God’s sake, why 
poetry? Why not mathematics or 
history? Why not tell how to 
make the metal of the book itself? 
Now there is a subject worthy of 
a book.” 



A CITY NEAR CENTAURUS 



Maota shook his head. “One 
does not study a dead culture to 
learn how they made things, but 
how they thought. But we are 
wasting time. I must kill you now, 
so I can get some rest.” 

The old man raised the gun. 

44 Vjf/'AIT! You forget that I 
” also have a weapon.” He 
pointed to the spot behind his ear 
where the cylinder was buried. “I 
can move faster than you can fire 
the gun.” 

Maota nodded. “I have heard 
how you travel. It does not mat- 
ter. I will kill you anyway.” 

“I suggest we negotiate.” 

“No.” 

“Why not?” 

Maota looked off toward the 
hills, old eyes filmed from years 
of sand and wind, leather skin 
lined and pitted. The hills stood 
immobile, brown-gray, already 
shimmering with heat, impotent. 

“Why not?” Michaelson re- 
peated. 

“Why not what?” Maota 
dragged his eyes back. 

“Negotiate.” 

“No.” Maota’s eyes grew hard 
as steel. They stood there in the 
sun, not twenty feet apart, hating 
each other. The two moons, very 
pale and far away on the western 
horizon, stared like two bottom- 
less eyes. 

“All right, then. At least it’s a 
quick death. I hear that thing just 



89 




disintegrates a man. Pfft! And 
that’s that.” 

Michaelson prepared himself 
to move if the old man’s finger 
slid closer toward the firing stud. 
The old man raised the gun. 

“Wait!” 

“Now what?” 

“At least read some of the 
book to me before I die, then.” 

The gun wavered. “I am not an 



unreasonable man,” the webfoot 
said. 

Michaelson stepped forward, 
extending his arm with the book. 

“No, stay where you are. Throw 
it.” 

“This book is priceless. You 
just don’t go throwing such valu- 
able items around.” 

“It won’t break. Throw it.” 

Michaelson threw the book. It 



landed at Maota’s feet, spouting 
sand against his leg. He shifted 
the weapon, picked up the book 
and leafed through it, raising his 
head in a listening attitude, 
searching for a suitable passage. 
Michaelson heard the thin, metal- 
lic pages rustle softly. He could 
have jumped and seized the weap- 
on at that moment, but his desire 
to hear the book was strong. 



Maota read, Michaelson 
^ listened. The cadence was 
different, the syntax confusing. 
But the thoughts were there. It 
might have been a professor back 
on Earth reading to his students. 
Keats, Shelley, Browning. These 
people were human, with human 
thoughts and aspirations. 

The old man stopped reading. 
He squatted slowly, keeping

Michaelson in sight, and laid the 
book face up in the sand. Wind 
moved the pages. 

“See?” he said. “The spirits 
read. They must have been great 
readers, these people. They drink 
the book, as if it were an elixir. 
See how gentle! They lap at the 
pages like a new kitten tasting 
milk.” 

Michaelson laughed. “You cer- 
tainly have an imagination.” 

“What difference does it 
make?” Maota cried, suddenly 
angry. “You want to close up all 
these things in boxes for a poster- 
ity who may have no slightest 
feeling or appreciation. I want to 
leave the city as it is, for spirits 
whose existence I cannot prove.” 

The old man’s eyes were furi- 
ous now, deadly. The gun came 
down directly in line with the 
Earthman’s chest. The gnarled 
finger moved. 

Michaelson, using the power of 
the cylinder behind his ear, 
jumped behind the old webfoot. 
To Maota it seemed that he had 
flicked out of existence like a 
match blown out. The next in- 
stant Michaelson spun him 
around and hit him. It was an in- 
expert fist, belonging to an arche- 
ologist, not a fighter. But Maota 
was an old man. 

He dropped in the sand, mo- 
mentarily stunned. Michaelson 
bent over to pick up the gun and 
the old man, feeling it slip from 



his fingers, hung on and was 
pulled to his feet. 

They struggled for possession 
of the gun, silently, gasping, kick- 
ing sand. Faces grew red. Lip s 
drew back over Michaelson’s 
white teeth, over Maota’s pink, 
toothless gums. The dead city’s 
fragile spires threw impersonal 
shadows down where they fought. 

Then quite suddenly a finger or 
hand — neither knew whose finger 
or hand — touched the firing stud. 

There was a hollow, whooshing 
sound. Both stopped still, realiz- 
ing the total destruction they 
might have caused. 

“It only hit the ground,” 
Michaelson said. 

A black, charred hole, two feet 
in diameter and — they could not 
see how deep — stared at them. 

Maota let go and sprawled in 
the sand. “The book!” he cried. 
“The book is gone!” 

“No! We probably covered it 
with sand while we fought.” 



DOTH men began scooping 
sand in their cupped hands, 
digging frantically for the book. 
Saliva dripped from Maota’s 
mouth, but he didn’t know or care. 

Finally they stopped, exhaust- 
ed. They had covered a substan- 
tial area around the hole. They 
had covered the complete area 
where they had been. 

“We killed it,” the old man 
moaned.

“It was just a book. Not alive, 
y ou know.” 

“How do you know?” The old 
man's pale eyes were filled with 
tears. “It talked and it sang. In 
a way, it had a soul. Sometimes 
on long nights I used to imagine it 
loved me, for taking care of it.” 
“There are other books. We’ll 
get another.” 

Maota shook his head. “There 
are no more.” 

“But I’ve seen them. Down 
there in the square building.” 

“Not poetry. Books, yes, but 
not poetry. That was the only 
book with songs.” 

“I’m sorry.” 

“You killed it!” Maota sudden- 
ly sprang for the weapon, lying 
forgotten in the sand. Michaelson 
put his foot on it and Maota was 
too weak to tear it loose. He could 
only weep out his rage. 

When he could talk again, 
Maota said, “I am sorry, Mr. 
Earthgod. I’ve disgraced myself.” 
“Don’t be sorry.” Michaelson 
helped him to his feet. “We fight 
for some reasons, cry for others. 
A priceless book is a good reason 
for either.” 

“Not for that. For not winning. 

I should have killed you last night 
when I had the chance. The gods 
give us chances and if we don’t 
take them we lose forever.” 

"I told you before! We are on 
the same side. Negotiate. Have 
you never heard of negotiation?” 



“You are a god,” Maota said. 
“One does not negotiate with gods. 
One either loves them, or kills 
them.” 

“That’s another thing. I am not 
a god. Can’t you understand?” 

“Of course you are.” Maota 
looked up, very sure. “Mortals 
cannot step from star to star like 
crossing a shallow brook.” 

“No, no. I don’t step from one 
star to another. An invention does 
that. Just an invention. I carry it 
with me. It’s a tiny thing. No one 
would ever guess it has such 
power. So you see, I’m human, 
just like you. Hit me and I hurt. 
Cut me and I bleed. I love. I hate. 
I was born. Some day I’ll die. See? 
I’m human. Just a human with a 
machine. No more than that.” 

1VTAOTA laughed, then sobered 
quickly. “You lie.” 

“No.” 

“If I had this machine, could I 
travel as you?” 

“Yes.” 

“Then I’ll kill you and take 
yours.” 

“It would not work for you.” 

“Why?” 

“Each machine is tailored for 
each person.” 

The old man hung his head. 
He looked down into the black, 
charred hole. He walked all 
around the hole. He kicked at the 
sand, looking half-heartedly again 
for the book.

“Look,” Michaelson said. “I’m 
sure I’ve convinced you that I’m 
human. Why not have a try at 
negotiating our differences?” 

He looked up. His expressive 
eyes, deep, resigned, studied 
Michaelson’s face. Finally he 
shook his head sadly. “When we 
first met I hoped we could think 
the ancient thoughts together. 
But our paths diverge. We have 
finished, you and I.” 

He turned and started off, 
shoulders slumped dejectedly. 

Michaelson caught up to him. 
“Are you leaving the city?” 

“No.” 

“Where are you going?” 
“Away. Far away.” Maota 
looked off toward the hills, eyes 
distant. 

“Don’t be stupid, old man. How 
can you go far away and not 
leave the city?” 

“There are many directions. 
You would not understand.” 
“East. West. North. South. Up. 
Down.” 

“No, no. There is another di- 
rection. Come, if you must see.” 
Michaelson followed him far 
down the street. They came to a 
section of the city he had not 
seen before. Buildings were small- 
er, spires dwarfed against larger 
structures. Here a path was 
packed in the sand, leading to a 
particular building. 

Michaelson said, “This is where 
you live?” 



“Yes.” 

Maota went inside, Michaelson 1 
stood in the entrance and looked j 
around. The room was clean, f Ur „ ^ 
nished with hand made chairs and ' 
a bed. Who is this old man, he 
thought, far from his people, li v . ] 
ing alone, choosing a life of soli- 
tude among ancient ruins but not 
touching them? Above the bed a 
“clock” was fastened to the wall. 
Michaelson remembered his 
fright — thinking of the warmth 
where warmth should not be. 

Maota pointed to it. 

“You asked about this ma- 
chine,” he said. “Now I will tell 
you.” He laid his hand against it. 
“Here is power to follow another 
direction.” 

ly/ldCHAELSON tested one of 
the chairs to see if it would 
hold his weight, then sat down. 
His curiosity about the instrument 
was colossal, but he forced a 
short laugh. “Maota, you are com- 
plex. Why not stop all this mys- 
tery nonsense and tell me about 
it? You know more about it than 
I.” 

“Of course.” Maota smiled a 
toothless, superior smile. “What 
do you suppose happened to this 
race?” 

“You tell me.” 

“They took the unknown direc- 
tion. The books speak of it. I don’t 
know how the instrument works, 
but one thing is certain. The race 



94 



2 U v 



GALAXY 



n ot die out, as a species be- 



comes 



extinct.” 



Michaelson was amused, but 
interested. “Something like a 
fourth dimension?” 

“I don’t know. I only know that 
w jth this instrument there is no 
death. I have read the books that 
speak of this race, this wonderful 
people who conquered all disease, 
w ho explored all the mysteries of 
science, who devised this machine 
to cheat death. See this button 
here on the face of the instru- 
ment? Press the button, and . .” 



“And what?” 

“I don’t know, exactly. But I 
have lived many years. I have 
walked the streets of this city and 
wondered, and wanted to press 
the button. Now I will do so.” 
Quickly the old man, still smil- 
ing, pressed the button. A high- 
pitched whine filled the air, just 
within audio range. Steady for a 
moment, it then rose in pitch 
passing beyond hearing quickly. 

The old man’s knees buckled. 
He sank down, fell over the bed, 
lay still. Michaelson touched him 
cautiously, then examined him 
more carefully. No question about 
it. 



The old man was dead. 



WHEELING depressed and alone, 
Michaelson found a desert 
knoll outside the city overlooking 
the tall spires that shone in the 
sunlight and gleamed in the 

A CITY NEAR CENTAURUS 



moonlight. He made a stretcher, 
rolled the old man’s body on to 
it and dragged it down the long 
ancient street and up the knoll. 

Here he buried him. 

But it seemed a waste of time. 
Somehow he knew beyond any 
doubt that the old native and his 
body were completely disassoci- 
ated in some sense more complete 
than death. 

In the days that followed he 
gave much thought to the “clock.” 
He came to the city every day. 
He spent long hours in the huge 
square building with the books. 
He learned the language by sheer 
bulldog determination. Then he 
searched the books for informa- 
tion about the instrument. 

Finally after many weeks, long 
after the winds had obliterated 
all evidence of Maota’s grave on 
the knoll, Michaelson made a de- 
cision. He had to know if the 
machine would work for him. 

And so one afternoon when the 
ancient spires threw long shadows 
over the sand he walked down the 
long street and entered the old 
man’s house. He stood before the 
instrument, trembling, afraid, but 
determined. He pinched his eyes 
shut tight like a child and pressed 
the button. 

The high-pitched whine started. 

Complete, utter silence. Void. 
Darkness. Awareness and mem- 
ory, yes; nothing else. Then 
Maota’s chuckle came. No sound, 



95 



an impression only like the voice 
from the ancient book. Where was 
he? There was no left or right, up 
or down. Maota was everywhere, 
nowhere. 

“Look!” Maota’s thought was 
directed at him in this place of 
no direction. “Think of the city 
and you will see it.” 

Michaelson did, and he saw the 
city beyond, as if he were looking 
through a window. And yet he 
was in the city looking at his own 
body. 

Maota’s chuckle again. “The 
city will remain as it is. You did 
not win after all.” 

“Neither did you.” 

“But this existence has com- 
pensations,” Maota said. “You 
can be anywhere, see anywhere 
on this planet. Even on your 
Earth.” 

Michaelson felt a great sadness, 
seeing his body lying across the 
old, home made bed. He looked 
closer. He sensed a vibration or 
life force — he didn’t stop to 
define it — in his body. Why was 
his dead body different from Old 
Maota’s? Could it be that there 
was some thread stretching from 
the reality of his body to his 
present state? 

“I don’t like your thoughts,” 
Maota said. “No one can go back. 
I tried. I have discussed it with 
many who are not presently in 
communication with you. No one 
can go back.” 




Michaelson decided he would 1 
try. 

467VO!” Maota’s thought was 
" prickled with fear and 
anger. 

Michaelson did not know how 
to try, but he remembered the 
cylinder and gathered all the 
force of his mind in spite of 
Maota’s protests, and gave his 
most violent command. 

At first he thought it didn’t 
work. He got up and looked 
around, then it struck him. He 
was standing up! 

The cylinder. He knew it was 
the cylinder. That was the differ- 
ence between himself and Maota. 
When he used the cylinder, that 
was where he went, the place 
where Maota was now. It was a 
door of some kind, leading to a 
path of some kind where distance 
was non-existent. But the “clock” 
was a mechanism to transport 
only the mind to that place. 

To be certain of it, he pressed 
the button again, with the same 
result as before. He saw his own 
body fall down. He felt Maota’s 
presence. 

“You devil!” Maota’s thought- 
scream was a sword of hate and 
anger, irrational suddenly, like 
a person who knows his loss is 
irrevocable. “I said you were a 
god. I said you were a god. I, 
said you were a god . !”

alone. 

In the beginning, he 
had seen many advantages to be-

once and for all correlate

see how long it would take

war, he would be able to get as 
fat and as dirty as he liked, he 
would be able to live more like 
an animal and think more like a 
god than any man for generations. 

But after a shorter time than 
he expected, it all got to be a 
tearing bore. Even the waiting to 
go crazy part of it. 

Not that he was going to have 
any great long wait of it. He was 
already talking to himself, mak- 
ing verbal notes for his lectures, 
and he had cut out a picture of 
Annie Oakley from an old book. 
He tacked it up and winked at 
it whenever he passed that way. 

Lately she was winking back at 
him. 

Loneliness was a physical 
weight on his skull. It peeled the 
flesh from his arms and legs and 
sandpapered his self-pity to a fine 
sensitivity. 

No one on Earth was as lonely 
as William Manet, and even 
William Manet could only be this 
lonely on Mars. 

Manet was Atmosphere Seeder 
Station 131-47’s own human. 

All Manet had to do was sit in 
the beating aluminum heart in 
the middle of the chalk desert 
and stare out, chin cupped in 
hands, at the flat, flat pavement 
of dirty talcum, at the stars 
gleaming as hard in the black sky 
as a starlet’s capped teeth . 
stars two of which were moons 
and one of which was Earth. He 



had to do nothing else. The whole* 
gimcrack was cybernetically COn 
trolled, entirely automatic. 
one was needed here — no hu- 
man being, at least. 

The Workers’ Union was a 
pretty small pressure group, but 
it didn’t take much to pressure 
the Assembly. Featherbedding 
had been carefully specified, in- 
cluding an Overseer for each of 
the Seeders to honeycomb Mars, 
to prepare its atmosphere for 
colonization. 

They didn’t give tests to find 
well-balanced, well-integrated 
people for the job. Well-balanced, 
well-integrated men weren’t go- 
ing to isolate themselves in a 
useless job. They got, instead, 
William Manet and his fellows. 

The Overseers were to stay as 
long as the job required. Passen- 
ger fare to Mars was about one 
billion dollars. They weren’t 
providing commuter service for 
night shifts. They weren’t pro- 
viding accommodations for cou- 
ples when the law specified only 
one occupant. They weren’t 
providing fuel (at fifty million 
dollars a gallon) for visits be- 
tween the various Overseers. 
They weren’t very providential. 

But it was two hundred thou- 
sand a year in salary, and it of- 
fered wonderful opportunities. 

It gave William Manet an op- 
portunity to think he saw a 
spaceship making a tailfirst land- 



98 



GALAXY 



11*6 on the table of the desert, its 
tail burning as bright as envy. 



M ANET suspected hallucina- 
tion, but in an existence with 
a fl the pallid dispassion of a re- 
quited love he was happy to wel- 
come dementia. Sometimes he 
even manufactured it. Sometimes 
he would run through the arteries 
0 f the factory and play that it had 
suddenly gone mad hating human 
beings, and was about to close 
down its bulkheads on him as sure 
as the Engineers’ Thumb and 
bale up the pressure-dehydrated 
digest, making so much stall 
flooring of him. He ran until he 
dropped with a kind of climaxing 
release of terror. 

So Manet put on the pressure 
suit he had been given because 
he would never need it, and 
marched out to meet the visiting 
spaceship. 

He wasn’t quite clear how he 
came from walking effortlessly 
across the Martian plain that had 
all the distance-perpetuating 
qualities of a kid’s crank movie 
machine to the comfortable in- 
terior of a strange cabin. Not a 
ship s cabin but a Northwoods 
cabin. 

The black and orange Hallo- 
we’en log charring in the slate 
stone fireplace seemed real. So 
did the lean man with the smiling 
mustache painted with the ran- 
dom designs of the fire, standing 



before the horizontal pattern of 
chinked wall. 

“Need a fresher?” the host 
inquired. 

Manet’s eyes wondered down 
to heavy water tumbler full of 
rich, amber whiskey full of 
sparks from the hearth. He 
stirred himself in the comfort- 
ingly warm leather chair. “No, 
no, I’m fine.” He let the word 
hang there for examination. 
“Pardon me, but could you tell 
me just what place this is?” 

The host shrugged. It was the 
only word for it. “Whatever place 
you choose it to be, so long as 
you’re with Trader Tom. ‘Service,’ 
that’s my motto. It is a way of 
life with me.” 

“Trader Tom? Service?” 

“Yes! That’s it exactly. It’s me 
exactly. Trader Tom Service — 
Serving the Wants of the Space- 
man Between the Stars. Of 
course, ‘stars’ is poetic. Any point 
of light in the sky in a star. We 
service the planets.” 

Manet took the tumbler in 
both hands and drank. It was 
good whiskey, immensely power- 
ful. “The government wouldn’t 
pay for somebody serving the 
wants of spacemen,” he exploded. 

“Ah,” Trader Tom said, cau- 
tionary. He moved nearer the 
fire and warmed his hands and 
buttocks. “Ah, but I am not a 
government service. I represent 
free enterprise.”

(, i lVT ONSENSE,” Manet said. 

“No group of private in- 
dividuals can build a spaceship. 
It takes a combine of nations.” 
“But remember only that busi- 
nessmen are reactionary. It’s well- 
known. Ask anyone on the street. 
Businessmen are reactionary 
even beyond the capitalistic 
system. Money is a fiction that 
exists mostly on paper. They play 
along on paper to get paper things, 
but to get real things they can 
forego the papers. Comprehend, 
mon ami? My businessmen have 
gone back Jo the barter system. 
Between them, they have the raw 
materials, the trained men, the 
man-hours to make a spaceship. 
So they make it. Damned reac- 
tionaries, all of my principals.” 
“I don’t believe you,” Manet 
stated flatly. His conversation 
had grown blunt with disuse. 
“What possible profit could your 
principals turn from running a 
trading ship among scattered ex- 
ploration posts on the planets? 
What could you give us that a 
benevolent government doesn’t 
already supply us with? And if 
there was anything, how could we 
pay for it? My year’s salary 
wouldn’t cover the transportation 
costs of this glass of whiskey.” 
“Do you find it good whiskey?” 
“Very good.” 

“Excellent?” 

“Excellent, if you prefer.” 

“I only meant — but never 



mind. We give you what y 0u 
want. As for paying for it — w jj 
forget about the payment. You 
may apply for a Trader Tom 
Credit Card.” 

“And I could buy anything that 
I wanted with it?” Manet de- 
manded. “That’s absurd. I’d never 
be able to pay for it.” 

“That’s it precisely!” Trader 
Tom said with enthusiasm. “You 
never pay for it. Charges are 
merely deducted from you r 
estate.” 

“But I may leave no estate!” 
Trader Tom demonstrated his 
peculiar shrug. “All businesses 
operate on a certain margin of 
risk. That is our worry.” 

jVT ANET finished the mellow 
whiskey and looked into the 
glass. It seemed to have been 
polished clean. “What do you 
have to offer?” 

“Whatever you want?” 
Irritably, “How do I know 
what I want until I know what 
you have?” 

“You know.” 

“I know? All right, I know. 
You don’t have it for sale.” 

“Old chap, understand if you 
please that I do not only sell. I 
am a trader — Trader Tom. I 
trade with many parties. There 
are, for example . extraterres- 
trials.” 

“Folk legend!” 

“On the contrary, mon cher,

cal reality. The Assembly could 
n0 longer justify their disposition 
0 f the cosmos if it were known 
they were dealing confiscation 
w ithout representation. Come,

Manet gave in to it. “I want to 
be not alone,” he said. 

“Of course,” Trader Tom re- 
plied, “I suspected. It is not so 
unusual, you know. Sign here. 
And here. Two copies. This is 
yours. Thank you so much.” 
Manet handed back the pen 
and stared at the laminated card 
in his hand.

When he looked up from the 
card, Manet saw the box. Trader 
Tom was pushing it across the 
floor towards him. 

The box had the general dimen- 
sions of a coffin, but it wasn’t 
wood — only brightly illustrated 
cardboard. There was a large 
four-color picture on the lid show- 
ing men, women and children 
moving through a busy city 

HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS 



street. The red and blue letters 
said: 

LIFO 

The Socialization Kit 

“It is commercialized,” Trader 
Tom admitted with no little cha- 
grin. “It is presented to appeal to 
a twelve-year-old child, an erotic, 
aggressive twelve-year-old, the 
typical sensie goer — but that is 
reality. It offends men of good 
taste like ourselves, yet some- 
times it approaches being art. We 
must accept it.” 

“What’s the cost?” Manet 
asked. “Before I accept it, I have 
to know the charges.” 

“You never know the cost. 
Only your executor knows that. 
It’s the Trader Tom plan.” 

“Well, is it guaranteed?” 

“There are no guarantees,” 
Trader Tom admitted. “But I’ve 
never had any complaints yet.” 
“Suppose I’m the first?” Manet 
suggested reasonably. 

“You won’t be,” Trader Tom 
said. “I won’t pass this way 
again.” 

jyjANET didn’t open the box. 

He let it fade quietly in the 
filtered but still brilliant sunlight 
near a transparent wall. 

Manet puttered around the 
spawning monster, trying to 
brush the copper taste of the sta- 
tion out of his mouth in the 



100 



101 



mornings, talking to himself, 
winking at Annie Oakley, and 
waiting to go mad. 

Finally, Manet woke up one 
morning. He lay in the sheets of 
his bunk, suppressing the urge to 
go wash his hands, and came at 
last to the conclusion that, after 
all the delay, he was mad. 

So he went to open the box. 

The cardboard lid seemed to 
have become both brittle and 
rotten. It crumbled as easily as 
ideals. But Manet was old enough 
to remember the boxes Japanese 
toys came in when he was a boy, 
and was not alarmed. 

The contents were such a 
glorious pile of junk, of bottles 
from old chemistry sets, of pieces 
from old Erector sets, of name- 
less things and unremembered 
antiques from neglected places, 
that it seemed too good to 
have been assembled commer- 
cially. It was the collection of 
lifetime. 

On top of everything was a 
paperbound book, the size of the 
Reader’s Digest, covered in rip- 
pled gray flexiboard. The title 
was stamped in black on the 
spine and cover: The Making of 
Friends. 

Manet opened the book and, 
turning one blank page, found 
the title in larger print and 
slightly amplied: The Making of 
Friends and Others. There was 
no author listed. A further line of 



information stated: “A Manual 
for Lifo, The Socialization Kit.” 
At the bottom of the title page, 
the publisher was identified as: 
LIFO KIT CO, LTD, SYRA- 
CUSE. 

The unnumbered first chapter 
was headed Your First Friend. 

Before you go further, first find 
the Modifier in your kit. This is 
vital. 

He quickly riffled through the 
pages. Other Friends, Authority, 
A Companion . Then The Final 
Model. Manet tried to flip past 
this section, but the pages after 
the sheet labeled The Final 
Model were stuck together. More 
than stuck. There was a thick 
slab of plastic in the back of the 
book. The edges were ridged as 
if there were pages to this section, 
but they could only be the tracks 
of lame ants. 

Manet flipped back to page 
one. 

First find the Modifier in your 
kit. This is vital to your entire 
experiment in socialization. The 
Modifier is Part #A-1 on the 
Master Chart. 

He prowled through the box 
looking for some kind of a chart. 
There was nothing that looked 
like a chart inside. He retrieved 
the lid and looked at its inside. 



102 



GALAXY 




Nothing. He tipped the box and 
looked at its outside. Not a thing. 
There was always something 
missing from kits. Maybe even 
the Modifier itself. 

He read on, and probed and 
scattered the parts in the long 
box. He studied the manual in- 
tently and groped out with his 
free hand. 

The toe bone was connected to 
the foot bone. 

T HE Red King sat smugly in 
his diagonal corner. 

The Black King stood two 
places away, his top half tipsy 
in frustration. 

The Red King crabbed side- 
ways one square. 

The Black King pounced for- 
ward one space. 

The Red King advanced back- 
wards to face the enemy. 

The Black King shuffled side- 
ways. 

The Red King followed. 
Uselessly. 

“Tie game,” Ronald said. 

“Tie game,” Manet said. 

“Let’s talk,” Ronald said 
cheerfully. He was always cheer- 
ful. 

Cheerfulness was a personality 
trait Manet had thumbed out for 
him. Cheerful. Submissive. Co- 
operative. Manet had selected 
these factors in order to make 
Ronald as different a person from 
himself as possible. 



“The Korean-American War } 
was the greatest of all wars,” 1 
Ronald said pontifically. 

“Only in the air,” Manet cor- j 
rected him. 

Intelligence was one of the 
factors Manet had punched to 
suppress. Intelligence. Aggressive- 
ness. Sense of perfection. Ronald 
couldn’t know any more than 
Manet, but he could (and did) 
know less. He had seen to that 
when his own encephalograph 
matrix had programmed Ronald’s 
feeder. 

“There were no dogfights in 
Korea,” Ronald said. 

“I know.” 

“The dogfight was a combat of 
hundreds of planes in a tight 
area, the last of which took place 
near the end of the First World 
War. The aerial duel, sometimes 
inaccurately referred to as a 
‘dogfight’ was not seen in Korea 
either. The pilots at supersonic 
speeds only had time for single 
passes at the enemy. Still, I be- 
lieve, contrary to all experts, that 
this took greater skill, man more 
wedded to machine, than the lei- 
surely combats of World War 
One.” 

“I know.” 

“Daniel Boone was still a crack 
shot at eight-five. He was 
said to be warm, sincere, modest, 
truthful, respected and rheu- 
matic.” 

“I know.” 



104 



GALAXY 



ANET knew it all. He had 
heard it all before, 
fie was so damned sick of hear- 
jj,g about Korean air battles, 
paniel Boone, the literary quali- 
fies of ancient sports fiction mag- 
azines, the painting of Norman 
Rockwell, New York swing, ad 
n auseum. What a narrow band of 
interests! With the whole uni- 
verse to explore in thought and 
concept, why did he have to be 
trapped with such an unoriginal 
human being? 

Of course, Ronald wasn’t an 
original human being. He was a 
copy. 

Manet had been interested in 
the Fabulous Forties — Lt. 
“Hoot” Gibson, Sam Merwin 
tennis stories, Saturday Evening 
Post covers — when he had first 
learned of them, and he had 
learned all about them. He had 
firm opinions on all these. 

He yearned for someone to 
challenge him — to say that 
Dime Sports had been nothing 
but a cheap yellow rag and, why, 
Sewanee Review, there had been 
a magazine for you. 

Manet’s only consolidation was 
that Ronald’s tastes were lower 
than his own. He patriotically in- 
sisted that the American Sabre 
Jet was superior to the Mig. He 
maintained with a straight face 
that Tommy Dorsey was a better 
band man than Benny Goodman. 
Ronald was a terrific jerk. 



“Ronald,” Manet said “you are 
a terrific jerk.” 

Ronald leaped up immediately 
and led with his right. 

Manet blocked it deftly and 
threw a right cross. 

Ronald blocked it deftly, and 
drove in a right to the navel. 

The two men separated and, 
puffing like steam locomotives 
passing the diesel works, closed 
again. 

Ronald leaped forward and 
lead with his right. 

Manet stepped inside the 
swing and lifted an uppercut to 
the ledge of Ronald’s jaw. 

Ronald pinwheeled to the floor. 

He lifted his bruised head from 
the deck and worked his red- 
dened mouth. “Had enough?” he 
asked Manet. 

Manet dropped his fists to his 
sides and turned away. “Yes.” 

Ronald hopped up lightly. “An- 
other checkers, Billy Boy?” 

“No.” 

“Okay. Anything you want, 
William, old conquerer.” 

Manet scrunched up inside 
himself in impotent fury. 

Ronald was maddeningly co- 
operative and peaceful. He would 
even get in a fist fight to avoid 
trouble between them. He would 
do anything Manet wanted him 
to do. He was so utterly damned 
stupid. 

Manet’s eyes orbitted towards 
the checkerboard.

But if he were so much more 
stupid than he, Manet, why was 
it that their checker games al- 
ways ended in a tie? 

r | ''HE calendar said it was Spring 
on Earth when the radio was 
activated for a high-speed infor- 
mation and entertainment trans- 
mission. 

The buzzer-flasher activated in 
the solarium at the same time. 

Manet lay stretched out on his 
back, naked, in front of the trans- 
parent wall. 

By rolling his eyes back in his 
head, Manet could see over a 
hedge of eyebrows for several 
hundred flat miles of white sand. 

And several hundred miles of 
desert could see him. 

For a moment he gloried in the 
blatant display of his flabby mus- 
cles and patchy sunburn. 

Then he sighed, rolled over to 
his feet and started trudging to- 
ward Communication. 

He padded down the rib-ridged 
matted corridor, taking his usual 
small pleasure in the kaleido- 
scopic effect of the spiraling re- 
flections on the walls of the 
tubeway. 

As he passed the File Room, 
he caught the sound of the pound- 
ing vibrations against the stop- 
pered plug of the hatch. 

“Come on, Billy Buddy, let me 
out of this place!” 

Manet padded on down the 



hall. He had, he recalled, shove<} 
Ronald in there on Lincoln’s 
Birthday, a minor ironic twist he 
appreciated quietly. He had been 
waiting in vain for Ronald to run 
down ever since. 

In Communication, he took a 
seat and punched the slowed 
down playback of the trans- 
mission. 

“Hello, Overseers,” the Voice 
said. It was the Voice of the 
B.B.C. It irritated Manet. He 
never understood how the British 
had got the space transmissions 
ass’gnment for the English lan- 
guage. He would have preferred 
an American disk-jockey himself, 
one who appreciated New York 
swing. 

“We imagine that you are most 
interested in how long you shall 
be required to stay at your pres- 
ent stations,” said the Voice of 
God’s paternal uncle. “As you on 
Mars may know, there has been 
much discussion as to how long 
it will require to complete the 
present schedule — ” there was of 
course no “K” sound in the word 
— “for atmosphere seeding. 

“The original, non-binding esti- 
mate at the time of your depart- 
ure was 18.2 years. However, 
determining how long it will take 
our stations properly to remake 
the air of Mars is a problem com- 
parable to finding the age of the 
Earth. Estimates change as new 
factors are learned. You may re-

ca ll that three years ago the 
official estimate was changed to 
thirty* one years. The recent esti- 
mate by certain reactionary 
sources of two hundred and 
seventy-four years is not an offi- 
cial government estimate. The 
news for you is good, if you are 
becoming nostalgic for home, or 
not particularly bad if you are 
counting on drawing your hand- 
some salary for the time spent on 
Mars. We have every reason to 
believe our original estimate was 
substantially correct. The total 
time is, within limits of error, a 
flat 18 years.” 

A very flat 18 years, Manet 
thought as he palmed off the 
recorder. 

He sat there thinking about 
eighteen years. 

He did not switch to video for 
some freshly taped westerns. 

Finally, Manet went back to 
the solarium and dragged the big 
box out. There was a lot left in- 
side. 

One of those parts, one of those 
bones or struts of flesh sprayers, 
one of them, he now knew, was 
the Modifier. 

The Modifier was what he 
needed to change Ronald. Or to 
shut him off. 

If only the Master Chart 
hadn’t been lost, so he would 
know what the Modifier looked 
like! He hoped the Modifier itself 
wasn’t lost. He hated to think of 



Ronald locked in the Usher tomb 
of the File Room for 18 flat years. 
Long before that, he would have 
worn his fists away hammering at 
the hatch. Then he might start 
pounding with his head. Perhaps 
before the time was up he would 
have worn himself down to noth- 
ing whatsoever. 

Manet selected the ripple- 
finished gray-covered manual 
from the hodgepodge, and 
thought: eighteen years. 

Perhaps I should have begun 
here, he told himself. But I really 
don’t have as much interest in’ 
that sort of thing as the earthier 
types. Simple companionship was 
all I wanted. And, he thought on, 
even an insipid personality like 
Ronald’s would be bearable with 
certain compensations. 

Manet opened the book to the 
chapter headed: The Making of 
a Girl. 

'17’ERONICA crept up behind 
T Manet and slithered her 
hands up his back and over his 
shoulders. She leaned forward 
and breathed a moist warmth in- 
to his ear, and worried the lobe 
with her even white teeth. 

Daniel Boone,” she sighed 
huskily, “only killed three In- 
dians in his life.” 

“I know.” 

Manet folded his arms sto- 
ically and added: “Please don’t 
talk.”

She sighed her instant agree- 
ment and moved her expressive 
hands over his chest and up to 
the hollows of his throat. 

“I need a shave,” he observed. 

Her hands instantly caressed 
his face to prove that she liked a 
rather bristly, masculine counte- 
nance. 

Manet elbowed Veronica away 
in a gentlemanly fashion. 

She made her return. 

“Not now,” he instructed her. 

“Whenever you say.” 

He stood up and began pacing 
off the dimensions of the com- 
partment. There was no doubt 
about it: he had been missing his 
regular exercise. 

“Now?” she asked. 

“I’ll tell you.” 

“If you were a jet pilot,” Ver- 
onica said wistfully, “you would 
be romantic. You would grab 
love when you could. You would 
never know which moment would 
be last. You would make the most 
of each one.” 

“I’m not a jet pilot,” Manet 
said. “There are no jet pilots. 
There haven’t been any for gen- 
erations.” 

“Don’t be silly,” Veronica said. 
“Who else would stop those vile 
North Koreans and Red China 
‘volunteers’?” 

“Veronica,” he said carefully, 
“the Korean War is over. It was 
finished even before the last of 
the jet pilots.” 



“Don’t be silly,” she snapped. 
“If it were over, I’d know about 
it, wouldn’t I?” 

She would, except that some- 
how she had turned out even less 
bright, less equipped with 
Manet’s own store of information, 
than Ronald. Whoever had built 
the Lifo kit must have had 
ancient ideas about what consti- 
tuted appropriate “feminine” 
characteristics. 

“I suppose,” he said heavily, 
“that you would like me to take 
you back to Earth and introduce 
you to Daniel Boone?” 

“Oh, yes.” 

“Veronica, your stupidity is 
hideous.” 

She lowered her long blonde 
lashes on her pink cheeks. “That 
is a mean thing to say to me. But 
I forgive you.” 

An invisible hand began press- 
ing down steadily on the top of 
his head until it forced a sound 
out of him. “Aaaawrraagggh! 
Must you be so cloyingly sweet? 
Do you have to keep taking that? 
Isn’t there any fight in you at 
all?” 

He stepped forward and back- 
handed her across the jaw. 

It was the first time he had 
ever struck a woman, he realized 
regretfully. He now knew he 
should have been doing it long 
ago. 

Veronica sprang forward and 
led with a right. 



108

R ONALD’S cries grew louder 
as Manet marched Veronica 
through the corridor. 

“Hear that?” he inquired, smil- 
ing with clenched teeth. 

“No, darling.” 

Well, that was all right. He re- 
membered he had once told her 
to ignore the noise. She was still 
following orders. 

“Come on, Bill, open up the 
hatch for old Ronald,” the voice 
carried through sepulchrally. 

“Shut up!” Manet yelled. 

The voice dwindled stub- 
bornly, then cut off. 

A silence with a whisper of 
metallic ring to it. 

Why hadn’t he thought of that 
before? Maybe because he se- 
cretly took comfort in the sound 
of an almost human voice echoing 
through the station. 

Manet threw back the bolt and 
wheeled back the hatch. 

Ronald looked just the same 
as had when Manet had seen him 
last. His hands didn’t seem to 
have been worn away in the least. 
Ronald’s lips seemed a trifle 
chapped. But that probably came 
not from all the shouting but 
from having nothing to drink for 
some months. 

Ronald didn’t say anything to 
Manet. 

But he looked offended. 

“You,” Manet said to Veronica 
with a shove in the small of the 
back, “inside, inside.” 



Ronald sidestepped the lurch- 
ing girl. 

“Do you know what I’m going 
to do with you? Manet de- 
manded. “I’m going to lock you 
up in here, and leave you for a 
day, a month, a year, forever! 
Now what do you think about 
that?” 

“If you think it’s the right 
thing, dear,” Veronica said hes- 
itantly. 

“You know best, Willy,” Ron- 
ald said uncertainly. 

Manet slammed the hatch in 
disgust. 

Manet walked carefully down 
the corridor, watching streamers 
of his reflection corkscrewing into 
the curved walls. He had to walk 
carefully, else the artery would 
roll up tight and squash him. But 
he walked too carefully for this 
to happen. 

As he passed the File Room, 
Ronald’s voice said: “In my 

opinion, William, you should let 
us out.” 

“I,” Veronica said, “honestly 
feel that you should let me out, 
Bill, dearest.” 

Manet giggled. “What? What 
was that? Do you suggest that I 
take you back after you’ve been 
behind a locked door with my 
best friend?” 

He went down the corridor, 
giggling. 

He giggled and thought: This 
will never do.

T>OURING and tumbling 
through the Lifo kit, consult- 
ing the manual diligently, Manet 
concluded that there weren’t 
enough parts left in the box to 
go around. 

The book gave instructions for 
The Model Mother, The Model 
Father, The Model Sibling and 
others. Yet there weren’t parts 
enough in the kit. 

He would have to take parts 
from Ronald or Veronica in order 
to make any one of the others. 
And he could not do that without 
the Modifier. 

He wished Trader Tom would 
return and extract some higher 
price from him for the Modifier, 
which was clearly missing from 
the kit. 

Or to get even more for simply 
repossessing the kit. 

But Trader Tom would not be. 
back. He came this way only 
once. 

Manet thumbed through the 
manual in mechanical frustration. 
As he did so, the solid piece of 
the last section parted sheet by 
sheet. 

He glanced forward and found 
the headings: The Final Model. 

There seemed something om- 
inous about that finality. But he 
had paid a price for the kit, 
hadn’t he? Who knew what price, 
when it came to that? He had 
every right to get everything out 
of the kit that he could. 



He read the unfolding p a g es '- 
critically. The odd assortment of 
ill-matched parts left in the box 
took a new shape in his mind and 
under his fingers. 

Manet gave one final spurt 
from the flesh-sprayer and stood 
back. 

Victor was finished. Perfect. 

Manet stepped forward, lifted 
the model’s left eyelid, tweaked 
his nose. 

“Move!” 






Victor leaped back into the 
Lifo kit and did a jig on one of 
the flesh-sprayers. 

As the device twisted as hand- 
ily as good intentions, Manet 
realized that it was not a flesh- 
sprayer but the Modifier. 

“It’s finished!” were Victor’s 
first words. “It’s done!” 

Manet stared at the tiny 
wreck. “To say the least.” 

Victor stepped out of the ob- 
long box. “There is something you 
should understand. I am different 
from the others.” 

“They all say that.” 

“I am not your friend.” 

“No?” 

“No. You have made yourself 
an enemy.” 

Manet felt nothing more at 
this information than an esthetic 
pleasure at the symmetry of the 
situation. 

“•It completes the final course 
in socialization,” Victor contin- 
ued. “I am your adversary. I will 



no 



GALAXY 



do everything I can to defeat you. 
j have a ll your knowledge. You 
do not have all your knowledge. 
If you let yourself know some of 
t he things, it could be used 
against you. It is my function to 
use everything I possibly can 
against you.” 

“When do you start?” 

“I’ve finished. I’ve done my 
worst. I have destroyed the 
Modifier.” 

“What’s so bad about that?” 
Manet asked with some interest. 

“You’ll have Veronica and 
Ronald and me forever now. 
We’ll never change. You’ll get 
older, and we’ll never change. 
You’ll lose your interest in New 
York swing and jet combat and 
Daniel Boone, and we’ll never 
change. We don’t change and you 
can’t change us for others. I’ve 
made the worst thing happen to 
you that can happen to any man. 
I’ve seen that you will always 
keep your friends.” 

HE prospect was frightful. 
Victor smiled. “Aren’t you 
going to denounce me for a 
fiend?” 

“Yes, it is time for the de- 
nouncement. Tell me, you feel 
that now you are through? You 
have fulfilled your function?” 

“Yes. Yes.” 

“Now you will have but to 
lean back, as it were, so to speak, 
and see me suffer?” 



“Yes.” 

“No. Can’t do it, old man. Can’t. 
I know. You’re too human, too 
like me. The one thing a man 
can’t accept is a passive state, a 
state of uselessness. Not if he 
can possibly avoid it. Something 
has to be happening to him. He 
has to be happening to some- 
thing. You didn’t kill me because 
then you would have nothing left 
to do. You’ll never kill me.” 

“Of course not!” Victor 
stormed. “Fundamental safety 
cut-off!” 

“Rationalization. You don’t 
want to kill me. And you can’t 
stop challenging me at every 
turn. That’s your function.” 

“Stop talking and just think 
about your miserable life,” Victor 
said meanly. “Your friends won’t 
grow and mature with you. You 
won’t make any new friends. 
You’ll have me to constantly re- 
mind you of your uselessness, 
your constant unrelenting steril- 
ity of purpose. How’s that for 
boredom, for passiveness?” 

“That’s what I’m trying to tell 
you,” Manet said irritably, his 
social manners rusty. “I won’t be 
bored. You will see to that. It’s 
your purpose. You’ll be a chal- 
lenge, an obstacle, a source of 
triumph every foot of the 
way. Don’t you see? With 
you for an enemy, I don’t 
need a friend!”

The pythons had entered int 0 
Mankind. No man knew at what 
moment he might be Possessed! 
By FREDERIK POHL 

Illustrated by RITTER 







I>ECAUSE of the crowd they 
held Chandler’s trial in the 
all-purpose room of the high 
school. It smelled of leather and 
stale sweat. He walked up the 
three steps to the stage, with the 
bailiff’s hand on his elbow, and 
took his place at the defendant's 
table. 

Chandler’s lawyef looked at 
him without emotion. He was ap- 
pointed by the court. He was 
willing to do his job, but his job 
didn’t require him to like his cli- 
ent. All he said was, “Stand up. 
The judge is coming in.” 

Chandler got to his feet and 
leaned on the table while the 
bailiff chanted his call and the 
chaplain read some verses from 
John. He did not listen. The 
Bible verse came too late to hqlp 
him, and besides he ached. 

When the police arrested him 
they had not been gentle. There 
were four of them. They were 
from the plant’s own security 
force and carried no guns. They 
didn’t need any; Chandler had 
put up no resistance after the 
first few moments — that is, he 
stopped as soon as he could stop 
— but the police hadn’t stopped. 
He remembered that very clear- 
ly. He remembered the nightstick 
across the sfde of his head that 
left his ear squashed and puffy, 



112

PLAGUE OF PYTHONS

he remembered the kick in the 
gut that still made walking pain- 
ful. He even remembered the 
series of blows about the skull 
that had knocked him out. 

The bruises along his rib cage 
and left arm, though, he did not 
remember getting. Obviously the 
police had been mad enough to 
keep right on subduing him after 
he was already unconscious. 

Chandler did not blame them 
— exactly. He supposed he 
would have done the same thing. 

The judge was having a long 
mumble with the court stenog- 
rapher apparently about some- 
thing which had happened in the 
Union House the night before. 
Chandler knew Judge Ellithorp 
slightly. He did not expect to get 
a fair trial. The previous Decem- 
ber the judge himself, while pos- 
sessed, had smashed the trans- 
mitter of the town’s radio station, 
which he owned, and set fire to 
the building it occupied. His son- 
in-law had been killed in the fire. 

Laughing, the judge waved the 
reporter back to his seat and 
glanced around the courtroom. 
His gaze touched Chandler light- 
ly, like the flick of the hanging 
strands of cord that precede a 
railroad tunnel. The touch car- 
ried the same warning. What lay 
ahead for Chandler was destruc- 
tion. 

“Read the charge,” ordered 
Judge Ellithorp. He spoke very 



loudly. There were more than six 
hundred persons in the auditor- 
ium; the judge didn’t want any 
of them to miss a word. 

The bailiff ordered Chandler 
to stand and informed him that 
he was accused of having, on the 
seventeenth day of June last, 
committed on the person of Mar- 
garet Flershem, a minor, an act 
of rape — “Louder!” ordered the 
judge testily. 

“Yes, Your Honor,” said the 
bailiff, and inflated his chest. “An 
Act of Rape under Threat of 
Bodily Violence,” he cried; “and 
Did Further Commit on the Per- 
son of Said Margaret Flershem 
an Act of Aggravated Assault — ” 

Chandler rubbed his aching 
side, looking at the ceiling. He 
remembered the look in Peggy 
Flershem’s eyes as he forced him- 
self on her. She was only sixteen 
years old, and at that time he 
hadn’t even known her name. 

The bailiff boomed on: “• — and 
Did Further Commit on that 
Same Seventeenth Day of June 
Last on the Person of Ingovar 
Porter an Act of Assault with 
Intent to Rape, the Foregoing 
Being a True Bill Handed Down 
by the Grand Jury of Sepulpas 
County in Extraordinary Session 
Assembled, the Eighteenth Day 
of June Last.” 

Judge Ellithorp looked satis- 
fied as the bailiff sat down, quite 
winded. While the judge hunted 



114 



GALAXY 



through the papers on his desk 
the crowd in the auditorium 
stirred and murmured. 

A child began to cry. 

rf^HE JUDGE stood up and 
■*- pounded his gavel. “What is 
it? What’s the matter with him? 
You, Dundon!” The court attend- 
ant the judge was looking at hur- 
ried over and spoke to the child’s 
mother, then reported to the 
judge. 

“I dunno, Your Honor. All he 
says is something scared him.” 
The judge was enraged. “Well, 
that’s just fine! Now we have to 
take up the time of all these good 
people, probably for no reason, 
and hold up the business of this 
court, just because of a child. 
Bailiff! I want you to clear this 
courtroom of all children under 
— ” he hesitated, calculating vot- 
ing blocks in his head — “all 
children under the age of six. 
Dr. Palmer, are you there? Well, 
you better go ahead with the — 
prayer.” The judge could not 
make himself say “the exor- 
cism.” 

“I’m sorry, madam,” he added 
to the mother of the crying two- 
year-old. “If you have someone 
to leave the child with, I’ll in- 
struct the attendants to save 
your place for you.” She was also 
a voter. 

Dr. Palmer rose, very grave, as 
he was embarrassed. He glared 



around the all-purpose room, de- 
fying anyone to smile, as he 
chanted: “Domina Pythonis, I 
command you, leave! Leave, Hel! 
Leave, Heloym! Leave, Sother 
and Thetragrammaton, leave, all 
unclean ones! I command you! 
In the name of God, in all of His 
manifestations!” He sat down 
again, still very grave. He knew 
that he did not make nearly as 
fine a showing as Father Lon, 
with his resonant in nomina Jesu 
Christi et Sancti Ubaldi and his 
censer, but the post of exorcist 
was filled in strict rotation, one 
month to a denomination, ever 
since the troubles started. Dr. 
Palmer was a Unitarian. Exor- 
cisms had not been in the curric- 
ulum at the seminary and he had 
been forced to invent his own. 

Chandler’s lawyer tapped him 
on the shoulder. “Last chance to 
change your mind,” he said. 

“No. I’m not guilty, and that’s 
the way I want to plead.” 

The lawyer shrugged and 
stood up, waiting for the judge 
to notice him. 

Chandler, for the first time, al- 
lowed himself to meet the eyes 
of the crowd. 

He studied the jury first. He 
knew some of them casually — 
it was not a big enough town to 
command a jury of total strang- 
ers for any defendant, and 
Chandler had lived there most of 
his life. He recognized Pop 



PLAGUE OF PYTHONS

Matheson, old and very stiff, who 
ran the railroad station cigar 
stand. Two of the other men were 
familiar as faces passed in the 
street. The forewoman, though, 
was a stranger. She sat there 
very composed and frowning, 
and all he knew about her was 
that she wore funny hats. Yester- 
day’s had been red roses when 
she was selected from the panel; 
today’s was, of all things, a 
stuffed bird. 

He did not think that any of 
them were possessed. He was not 
so sure of the audience. 

He saw girls he had dated in 
high school, long before he met 
Margot; men he worked with at 
the plant. They all glanced at 
him, but he was not sure who 
was looking out through some of 
those familiar eyes. The visitors 
reliably watched all large gather- 
ings, at least momentarily; it 
would be surprising if none of 
them were here. 

“All right, how do you plead,” 
said Judge Ellithorp at last. 

Chandler’s lawyer straightened 
up. “Not guilty, Your Honor, by 
reason of temporary pandemic 
insanity.” 

The judge looked pleased. The 
crowd murmured, but they were 
pleased too. They had him dead 
to rights and it would have been 
a disappointment if Chandler 
had pleaded guilty. They wanted 
to see one of the vilest criminals 



in contemporary human society 
caught, exposed, convicted and 
punished; they did not want to 
miss a step of the process. Al- 
ready in the playground behind 
the school three deputies from 
the sheriff’s office were loading 
their rifles, while the school jani- 
tor chalked lines around the 
handball court to mark where the 
crowd witnessing the execution 
would be permitted to stand. 

HPHE PROSECUTION made 
its case very quickly. Mrs. 
Porter testified that she worked 
at McKelvey Bros., the antibi- 
otics plant, where the defendant 
also worked. Yes, that was him. 
She had been attracted by the 
noise from the culture room last 

— let’s see — “Was it the seven- 
teenth day of June last?” 
prompted the prosecutor, and 
Chandler’s attorney instinctively 
gathered his muscles to rise, hesi- 
tated, glanced at his client and 
shrugged. That was right, it was 
the seventeenth. Incautiously she 
went right into the room. She 
should have known better, she 
admitted. She should have called 
the plant police right away, but, 
well, they hadn’t had any trou- 
ble at the plant, you know, and 

— well, she didn’t. She was a 
stupid woman, for all that she 
was rather good-looking, and in- 
satiably curious. She had seen 
Peggy Flershem on the floor. 



116 



GALAXY 



“She was all blood. And her 
clothes were — And she was, I 
mean her — her body was — ” 
With relentless tact the prosecu- 
tor allowed her to stammer out 
her observation that the girl 
had clearly been raped. And she 
had seen Chandler laughing and 
breaking up the place, throwing 
racks of cultures through the win- 
dows, upsetting trays. Of course 
she had crossed herself and tried 
a quick exorcism but there was 
no visible effect; then Chandler 
had leaped at her. “He was hate- 
ful! He was just foul!” But as he 
began to attack her the plant 
police came, drawn by her 
screams. 

Chandler’s attorney did not 
question. 

Peggy Flershem’s deposition 
was introduced without objection 
from the defense. But she had 
little to say anyway, having been 
dazed at first and unconscious 
later. The plant police testified 
to having arrested Chandler; a 
doctor described in chaste medi- 
cal words the derangements 
Chandler had worked on Peggy 
Flershem’s virgin anatomy. There 
was no question from Chandler’s 
lawyer — and, for that matter, 
nothing to question. Chandler did 
not hope to pretend that he had 
not ravished and nearly killed 
one girl, then done his best to 
repeat the process on another. 
Sitting there as the doctor testi- 



fied, Chandler was able to tally 
every break and bruise against 
the memory of what his own 
body had done. He had been a 
spectator then, too, as remote 
from the event as he was now; 
but that was why they had him 
on trial. That was what they did 
not believe. 

At twelve-thirty the prosecu- 
tion rested its case, Judge Elli- 
thorp looking very pleased. He 
recessed the court for one hour 
for lunch, and the guards took 
Chandler back to the detention 
cell in the basement of the school. 

Two Swiss cheese sandwiches 
and a wax-paper carton of choc- 
olate milk were on the desk. 
They were Chandler’s lunch. As 
they had been standing, the sand- 
wiches were crusty and the milk 
lukewarm. He ate them anyway. 
He knew what the judge looked 
pleased about. At one-thirty 
Chandler’s lawyer would put him 
on the stand, and no one would 
pay very much attention to what 
he had to say, and the jury would 
be out at most twenty minutes, 
and the verdict would be guilty. 
The judge was pleased because 
he would be able to pronounce 
sentence no later than four 
o’clock, no matter what. They 
had formed the habit of holding 
the executions at sundown. As, 
at that time of year, sundown 
was after seven, it would all go 
very well — for everyone but

Chandler. For Chandler it would 
be the end. 

II 

rpHE ODD thing about Chand- 
ler’s dilemma was not mere- 
ly that he was innocent — in a 
way, that is — but that many 
who were guilty (in a way; as 
guilty as he himself, at any rate) 
were free and honored citizens. 
Chandler himself was a widower 
because his own wife had been 
murdered. He had seen the mur- 
derer leaving the scene of the 
crime, and the man he had seen 
was in the courtroom today, 
watching Chandler’s own trial. Of 
the six hundred or so in the court, 
at least fifty were known to have 
taken part in one or more prov- 
able acts of murder, rape, arson, 
theft, sodomy, vandalism, assault 
and battery or a dozen other of- 
fenses indictable under the laws 
of the state. Of course, that could 
be said of almost any community 
in the world in those years; 
Chandler’s was not unique. What 
had put Chandler in the dock 
was not what his body had been 
seen to do, but the place in which 
it had been seen to do it. For 
everybody knew that medicine 
and agriculture were never mo- 
lested by the demons. 

Chandler’s own lawyer had 
pointed that out to him the day 
before the trial. “If it was any- 



where but at the McKelvey 
plant, all right, but there’s never 
been any trouble there. You 
know that. The trouble with you 
laymen is you think of lawyers 
in terms of Perry Mason, right? 
Rabbit out of the hat stuff. Well, 
I can’t do that. I can only pre- 
sent your case, whatever it is, the 
best way possible. And the best 
thing I can do for your case right 
now is tell you you haven’t got 
one.” At that time the lawyer 
was still trying to be fair. He was 
even casting around for some 
thought he could use to convince 
himself that his client was inno- 
cent, though he had frankly ad- 
mitted as soon as he introduced 
himself that he didn’t have much 
hope there. 

Chandler protested that he 
didn’t have to commit rape. He’d 
been a widower for a year, but — 

“Wait a minute,” said the law- 
yer. “Listen. You can’t make an 
ordinary claim of possession 
stick, but what about good old- 
fashioned insanity?” Chandler 
looked puzzled, so the lawyer 
explained. Wasn’t it possible that 
Chandler was — consciously, 
subconsciously, unconsciously, 
call it what you will — trying 
to get revenge for what had hap- 
pened to his own wife? 

No, said Chandler, certainly 
not! But then he had to stop and 
think. After all, he had never 
been possessed before; in fact, he 



had always retained a certain 
skepticism about “possession” — 
it seemed like such a convenient 
way for anyone to do any illicit 
thing he chose — until the mo- 
ment when he looked up to see 
Peggy Flershem walking into the 
culture room with a tray of agar 
disks, and was astonished to find 
himself striking her with the 
wrench in his hand and ripping 
at her absurdly floral-printed 
. slacks. Maybe his case was dif- 
ferent. Maybe it wasn’t the sort 
of possession that struck at ran- 
dom; maybe he was just off his 
rocker. 

Margot, his wife, had been cut 
up cruelly. He had seen his 
friend, Jack Souther, leaving his 
home hurriedly as he ap- 
proached; and although he had 
thought that the stains on his 
clothes looked queerly like blood, 
nothing in that prepared him for 
what he found in the rumpus 
room. It had taken him some 
time to identify the spread-out 
dissection on the floor with his 
wife Margot . “No,” he told 
his lawyer, “I was shaken up, of 
course. The worst time was the 
next night, when there was a 
knock on the door and I opened 
it and it was Jack. He’d come to 
apologize. I — fell apart; but I 
got over it. I tell you I was pos- 
sessed, that’s all.” 

“And I tell you that defense 
will put you right in front of a 



firing squad,” 
“And that’s all.” 



said his lawyer. 



jC'IVE OR SIX others had been 
executed for hoaxing; Chand- 
ler was familiar with the ritual. 
He even understood it, in a way. 
The world had gone to pot in 
the previous two years. The real 
enemy was out of reach; when 
any citizen might run wild and, 
when caught, relapse into his own 
self, terrified and sick, there was 
a need to strike back. But the 
enemy was invisible. The hoaxers 
were only whipping boys — but 
they were the only targets ven- 
geance had. 

The real enemy had struck the 
entire world in a single night. 
One day the people of the world 
went about their business in the 
gloomy knowledge that they 
were likely to make mistakes but 
with, at least, the comfort that 
the mistakes would be their own. 
The next day had no such com- 
fort. The next day anyone, any- 
where, was likely to find himself 
seized, possessed, working evil or 
whimsy without intention and 
helplessly. 

Chandler stood up, kicked the 
balled-up wax paper from his 
sandwiches across the floor and 
swore violently. 

He was beginning to wake 
from the shock that had gripped 
him. “Damn fool,” he said to him- 
self. He had no particular reason.

Like the world, he needed a 
whipping boy too, if only him- 
self. “Damn fool, you know 
they’re going to shoot you!” 

He stretched and twisted his 
body violently, alone in the mid- 
dle of the room, in silence. He 
had to wake up. He had to start 
thinking. In a quarter of an hour 
or less the court would recon- 
vene, and from then it was only 
a steady, quick slide to the grave. 

It was better to do anything 
than to do nothing. He examined 
the windows of his improvised 
cell. They were above his head 
and barred; standing on the 
table, he could see feet walking 
outside, in the paved play-yard 
of the school. He discarded the 
thought of escaping that way; 
there was no one to smuggle him 
a file, and there was no time. He 
studied the door 'to the hall. It 
was not impossible that when the 
guard opened it he could jump 
him, knock him out, run . run 
where? The room had been a 
storage place for athletic equip- 
ment at the end of a hall; the 
hall led only to the stairs and 
the stairs emerged into the court- 
room. It was quite likely, he 
thought, that the hall had an- 
other flight of stairs somewhere 
farther along, or through another 
room. What had he spent his 
taxes on these years, if not for 
schools designed with more than 
one exit in case of fire? But as 



he had not thought to mark an 
escape route when he Was 
brought in, it did him no g 00( j 
The guard, however, had a 
gun. Chandler lifted up an edge 
of the table and tried to shake 
one of the legs. They did not 
shake; that part of his taxes had 
been well enough spent, he 
thought wryly. The chair? Could 
he smash the chair to get a club 
which would give him a weapon 
to get the guard’s gun? . 

Before he reached the chair 
the door opened and his lawyer 
came in. 

“Sorry I’m late,” he said brisk- 
ly. “Well. As your attorney I have 
to tell you they’ve presented a 
damaging case. As I see it — ” 
“What case?” Chandler de- 
manded. “I never denied the acts. 
What else did they prove?” 
“Oh, God!” said his lawyer, not 
quite loudly enough to be insult- 
ing. “Do we have to go over that 
again? Your claim of possession 
would make a defense if it had 
happened anywhere else. We 
know that these cases exist, but 
we also know that they follow a 
pattern. Some areas seem to be 
immune — medical establish- 
ments, pharmaceutical plants 
among them. So they proved that 
all this happened in a pharma- 
ceutical plant. I advise you to 
plead guilty.” 

Chandler sat down on the 
edge of the table, controlling 

GALAXY 



himself very well, he thought, 
jje only asked: “Would that do 
me any good at all?” 

The lawyer reflected, gazing 
at the ceiling. No. I guess it 

vvouldn t. 

Chandler nodded. “So what 
else shall we talk about? Want 
to compare notes about where 
you were and I was the night 
the President went possessed?” 

The lawyer was irritated. He 
kept his mouth shut for a mo- 
ment until he thought he could 
keep from showing it. Outside a 
vendor was hawking amulets: 
“St. Ann beads! Witch knots! 
Fresh garlic, local grown, best in 
town!” The lawyer shook his 
head. 

“All right,” he said, “it’s your 
life. We’ll do it your way. Any- 
way, time’s up; Sergeant Grantz 
will be banging on the door any 
minute.” 

He zipped up his briefcase. 
Chandler did not move. “They 
don’t give us much time anyway,” 
the lawyer added, angry at 
Chandler and at hoaxers in gen- 
eral but not willing to say so. 
“Grantz is a stickler for prompt- 
ness.” 

Chandler found a crumb of 
cheese by his hand and absently 
ate it. The lawyer watched him 
and glanced at his watch. “Oh, 
hell,” he said, picked up his brief- 
case and kicked the base of the 
door. “Grantz! What’s the mat- 

PLAGUE OF PYTHONS 



ter with you? You asleep out 
there?” 

/’"''HANDLER was sworn, gave 
his name, admitted the truth 
of everything the previous wit- 
nesses had said. The faces were 
still aimed at him, every one. He 
could not read them at all any 
more, could not tell if they were 
friendly or hating, there were too 
many and they all had eyes. The 
jurors sat on their funeral-parlor 
chairs like cadavers, embalmed 
and propped, the dead witness- 
ing a wake for the living. Only 
the forewoman in the funny hat 
showed signs of life, looking 
alertly at Chandler, at the judge, 
at the man next to her, around 
the auditorium. Maybe it was a 
good sign. At least she did not 
have the frozen in concrete, 
guilty-as-hell look of the others. 

His attorney asked him the 
question he had been waiting for: 
“Tell us, in your own words, what 
happened.” Chandler opened his 
mouth, and paused. Curiously, he 
had forgotten what he wanted to 
say. He had rehearsed this mo- 
ment again and again; but all 
that came out was: 

“I didn’t do it. I mean, I did 
the acts, but I was possessed. 
That’s all. Others have done 
worse, under the same circum- 
stances, and been let off. Just as 
Fisher was acquitted for murder- 
ing the Leamards, as Draper got 



120 



121 



off after what he did to the Cline 
boy. As Jack Souther over there 
was let off after he murdered my 
own wife. They should be. They 
couldn’t help themselves. What- 
ever this thing is that takes con- 
trol, I know it can’t be fought. 
My God, you can’t even try to 
fight it!” 

He was not getting through. 
The faces had not changed. The 
forewoman of the jury was now 
searching systematically through 
her pocketbook, taking each item 
out and examining it, putting it 
back and taking out another. But 
between times she looked at him 
and at least her expression wasn’t 
hostile. He said, addressing her: 

“That’s all there is to it. It 
wasn’t me running my body. It 
was someone else. I swear it be- 
fore all of you, and before God.” 

The prosecutor did not bother 
to question him. 

Chandler went back to his seat 
and sat down and watched the 
next twenty minutes go by in 
the wink of an eye, rapid, rapid, 
they were in a hurry to shoot 
him. He could hardly believe that 
Judge Ellithorp could speak so 
fast, the jurymen rise and file 
out at a gallop, zip, whisk, and 
they were back again. Too fast! 
he cried silently, time had gone 
into high gear; but he knew that 
it was only his imagination. The 
twenty minutes had been a full 
twelve hundred seconds. And 



then time, as if to make ame ' ' 
came to a stop, abrupt, brak^ 
on. The judge asked the j Ury f*" 
their verdict and it was an 
nity before the forewoman arosT 
She was beginning to i 0Q , 
rather disheveled. Beaming at 
Chandler — surely the woman 
was rather odd, it couldn’t be 
just his imagination — she f Uln 
bled in her pocketbook for the 
slip of paper with the verdict 
But she wore an expression 0 f 
suppressed laughter. 

“I knew I had it,” she cried 
triumphantly and waved the slip 
above her head. “Now, let’s see.” 
She held it before her eyes and 
squinted. “Oh, yes. Judge, we the 

jury, and so forth and so on .” 

She paused to wink at Judge 
Ellithorp. An uncertain worried 
murmur welled up in the audi- 
torium. “All that junk, Judge,” 
she explained, “anyway, we u- 
nanimously — but unanimously , 
love! — find this son of a bitch 
innocent. Why,” she giggled, “we 
think he ought to get a medal, 
you know? I tell you what you 
do, love, you go right over and 
give him a big wet kiss and say 
you’re sorry.” She kept on talk- 
ing, but no one heard. The mur- 
mur because a mass scream. 

“Stop, stop her!” bawled the 
judge, dropping his glasses. 
“Bailiff!” 

The scream became a word, 
in many voices chorused: Pos- 



sessed! And beyond doubt the 
w oman was. The men around her 
hurled themselves away, as from 
leprosy among them, and then 
washed back like a lynch mob. 
She was giggling as they fell on 
her. “Got a cigarette? No ciga- 
rettes in this lousy bag — oh.” 
She screamed as they touched 
her, went limp and screamed a- 
gain. 

It was a different note this 
time, pure hysteria: “I couldn’t 
stop. Oh, God.” 

/"’HANDLER caught his lawyer 
^ by the arm and jerked him 
away from staring at the scene. 
All of a sudden he was alive 
again. “You, damn it. Listen! The 
jury acquitted me, right?” 

The lawyer was startled. 
“Don’t be ridiculous. It’s a clear 
case of — ” 

“Be a lawyer, man! You live 
on technicalities, don’t you? Make 
this one work for me!” 

The attorney gave him a queer, 
thoughtful look, hesitated, 
shrugged and got to his feet. He 
had to shout to be heard. “Your 
honor! I take it my client is free 
to go.” 

He made almost as much of a 
stir as the sobbing woman, but he 
outshouted the storm. “The jury’s 
verdict is on record. Granted 
there was an apparent case of 
possession. Nevertheless — ” 
Judge Ellithorp yelled back: 

PLAGUE OF PYTHONS 



“No nonsense, you! Listen to me, 
young man — ” 

The lawyer snapped, “Permis- 
sion to approach the bench.” 
“Granted.” 

Chandler sat unable to move, 
watching the brief, stormy con- 
ference. It was painful to be com- 
ing back to life. It was agony to 
hope. At least, he thought de- 
tachedly, his lawyer was fighting 
for him; the prosecutor’s face was 
a thundercloud. 

The lawyer came back, with 
the expression of a man who has 
won a victory he did not ex- 
pect, and did not want. “Your 
last chance, Chandler. Change 
your plea to guilty.” 

“But — ” 

“Don’t push your luck, boy! 
The judge has agreed to accept 
a plea. They’ll throw you out of 
town, of course. But you’ll be 
alive.” Chandler hesitated. “Make 
up your mind! The best I can do 
otherwise is a mistrial, and that 
means you’ll get convicted by 
another jury next week.” 

Chandler said, testing his luck: 
“You’re sure they’ll keep their 
end of the bargain?” 

The lawyer shook his head, his 
expression that of a man who 
smells something unpleasant. 
“Your honor! I ask you to dis- 
charge the jury. My client wishes 
to change his plea.” 

... In the school’s chemistry 
lab, an hour later, Chandler dis-

covered that the lawyer had left 
out one little detail. Outside there 
was a sound of motors idling, the 
police car that would dump him 
at the town’s limits; inside was a 
thin, hollow hiss. It was the 
sound of a Bunsen burner, and in 
its blue flame a crudely shaped 
iron changed slowly from cherry 
to orange to glowing straw. It 
had the .shape of a letter “H”. 

“H” for “hoaxer.” The mark 
they were about to put on his 
forehead would be with him 
wherever he went and as long 
as he lived, which would prob- 
ably not be long. “H” for “hoaxer,” 
so that a glance would show that 
he had been convicted of the 
worst offense of all. 

No one spoke to him as the 
sheriff’s man took the iron out 
of the fire, but three husky police- 
men held his arms while he 
screamed. 

Ill 

T HE pain was still burning 
when Chandler awoke the 
next day. He wished he had a 
bandage, but he didn’t, and that 
was that. 

He was in a freight car — had 
hopped it on the run at the yards, 
daring to sneak back into town 
long enough for that. He could 
not hope to hitchhike, with that 
mark on him. Anyway, hitchhik- 
ing was an invitation to trouble. 



The railroads were safer — . 
far safer than either cars or air 
transport, notoriously a lightning- 
rod attracting possession. Chand- 
ler was surprised when the train 
came crashing to a stop, each 
freight car smashing against the 
couplings of the one ahead, the 
engine jolting forward and stop- 
ping again. 

Then there was silence. It en- 
dured. 

Chandler, who had been slow- 
ly waking after a night of very 
little sleep, sat up against the 
wall of the boxcar and wondered 
what was wrong. 

It seemed remiss to start a day 
without signing the Cross or hear- 
ing a few exorcismal verses. It 
seemed to be mid-morning, time 
for work to be beginning at the 
plant. The lab men would be 
streaming in, their amulets ex- 
amined at the door. The chaplains 
would be wandering about, ready 
to pray a possessing spirit out. 
Chandler, who kept an open 
mind, had considerable doubt of 
the effectiveness of all the amu- 
lets and spells — certainly they 
had not kept him from a brutal 
ra pe — but he felt uneasy with- 
out them. The train still 
was not moving. In the silence 
he could hear the distant huffing 
of the engine. 

He went to the door, support- 
ing himself with one hand on 
the wooden wall, and looked out. 



124 



GALAXY 



The tracks followed the roll of 
a river, their bed a few feet higher 
than an empty three-lane high- 
way, which in turn was a dozen 
feet about the water. As he looked 
out the engine brayed twice. The 
train jolted uncertainly, then 
stopped again. 

Then there was a very long 
time when nothing happened at 
all. 

From Chandler’s car he could 
not see the engine. He was on the 
convex of the curve, and the 
other door of the car was sealed. 
He did not need to see it to 
know that something was wrong. 
There should have been a brake- 
man running with a flare to ward 
off other trains; but there was 
not. There should have been a 
station, or at least a water tank, 
to account for the stop in the 
first place. There was not. Some- 
thing had gone wrong, and Chand- 
ler knew what it was. Not the 
details, but the central fact that 
lay behind this and behind almost 
everything that went wrong these 
days. 

The engineer was possessed. It 
had to be that. 

Yet it was odd, he thought, as 
odd as his own trouble. He had 
chosen this car with care. It con- 
tained eight refrigerator cars full 
of pharmaceuticals, and if any- 
thing was known about the laws 
governing possession, as his law- 
yer had told him, it was that such 



things were almost never inter- 
fered with. 

Chandler jumped down to the 
roadbed, slipped on the crushed 
rock and almost fell. He had for- 
gotten the wound on his forehead. 
He clutched the sill of the car 
door, where an ankh and fleur-de- 
lis had been chalked to ward off 
demons, until the sudden rush of 
blood subsided and the pain be- 
gan to relent. After a moment he 
walked gingerly to the end of the 
car, slipped between the cars, 
dodged the couplers and climbed 
the ladder to its roof. 

It was a warm, bright, silent 
day. Nothing moved. From his 
height he could see the Diesel at 
the front of the train and the 
caboose at its rear. No people. 
The train was halted a quarter- 
mile from where the tracks 
swooped across the river on a 
suspension bridge. Away from 
the river, the side of the tracks 
that had been hidden from him 
before, was an uneven rock cut 
and, above it, the slope of a 
mountain. 

By looking carefully he could 
spot the signs of a number of 
homes within half a mile or so 
— the corner of a roof, a glassed- 
in porch built to command a 
river view, a twenty-foot tele- 
vision antenna poking through 
the trees. There was also the 
curve of a higher road along which 
the homes were strung.

Chandler took thought. He 
was alive and free, two gifts more 
gracious than he had had any 
right to expect. However, he 
would need food and he would 
need at least some sort of band- 
age for his forehead. He had a 
wool cap, stolen from the high 
school, which would hide the 
mark, though what it would do 
to the burn on his skin was some- 
thing else again. 

Chandler climbed down the 
ladder. With considerable pain he 
gentled the cap over the great 
raw H on his forehead and began 
to climb the mountain. 

TTE KNOCKED on the first 
door he came to, a great old 
three-story house with well 
tended gardens. 

There was a wait. The air 
smelled warmly of honeysuckle 
ancl mown grass, with wild onions 
chopped down by the blades of 
the mower. It was pleasant, or 
would have been in happier 
times. He knocked again, per- 
emptorily, and the door was 
opened at once. Evidently some- 
one had been right inside, listen- 
ing. 

A man stared at him. “Stranger, 
what do you want?” He was short, 
plump, with an extremely thick 
and unkempt beard. It did not 
appear to have been grown for 
its own sake, for where the facial 
hair could not be coaxed to grow 




his skin had the gross pits of old 
acne. 

Chandler said glibly: “Good 
morning. I’m working my W ay 
east. I need something to eat 
and I’m willing to work for it.” 

The man withdrew, leaving the 
upper half of the Dutch door 
open. As it looked in on only a 
vestibule it did not tell Chandler 
much. There was one curious 
thing — a lath and cardboard 
sign, shaped like an arc of a 
rainbow, lettered: 



■ 



WELCOME TO ORPHALESE 



He puzzled over it and dismissed 
it. The entrance room, apart from 
the sign, had a knickknack shelf 
of Japanese carved ivory and an 
old-fashioned umbrella rack, but 
that added nothing to his knowl- 
edge. He had already guessed 
that the owners of this home 
were well off. Also it had been 
recently painted; so they were not 
demoralized, as so much of the 
world had been demoralized, by 
the coming of the possessors. 
Even the elaborate sculpturing of 
its hedges had been maintained. 

The man came back and with 
him was a girl of fifteen or so. 
She was tall, slim and rather 
homely, with a large jaw and an 
oval face. “Guy, he’s not much 
to look at,” she said to the pock- 
marked man. “Meggie, shall I let 
him in?” he asked. “Guy, you 






126

might as well,” she shrugged, 
staring at Chandler with interest 
but not sympathy. 

“Stranger, come along,” said 
the man named Guy, and led him 
through a short hall into an 
enormous living room, a room two 
stories high with a ten-foot fire- 
place. 

Chandler’s first thought was 
that he had stumbled in upon a 
wake. The room was neatly laid 
out in rows of folding chairs, 
more than half of them occupied. 
He entered from the side, but all 
the occupants of the chairs were 
looking toward him. He returned 
their stares; he had had a good 
deal of practice lately in looking 
back at staring faces, he reflected. 
“Stranger, go on,” said the man 
who had let him in, nudging him, 
“and meet the people of Orphal- 
ese.” 

Chandler hardly heard him. He 
had not expected anything like 
this. It was a meeting, a Daumier 
caricature of a Thursday After- 
noon Literary Circle, old men 
with faces like moons, young 
women with faces like hags. They 
were strained, haggard and fear- 
ful, and a surprising number of 
them showed some sort of physi- 
cal defect, a bandaged leg, an 
arm in a sling or merely the 
marks of pain on the features. 
“Stranger, go in,” repeated the 
man, and it was only then that 
Chandler noticed the man was 



holding a pistol, pointed at his 
head. 

/"'HANDLER sat in the rear of 
^ the room, watching. There 
must be thousands of little colo- 
nies like this, he reflected; with 
the breakdown of long-distance 
communication the world had 
been atomized. There was a real 
fear, well justified, of living" i n 
large groups, for they too were 
lightning rods for possession. The 
world was stumbling along, but 
it was lame in all its members; a 
planetary lobotomy had stolen 
from it its wisdom and plan. If, 
he reflected dryly, it had ever 
had any. 

But of course things were bet- 
ter in the old days. The world 
had seemed on the brink of blow- 
ing itself up, but at least it was 
by its own hand. Then came 
Christmas. 

It had happened at Christmas, 
and the first sign was on nation- 
wide television. The old Presi- 
dent, balding, grave and plump, 
was making a special address to 
the nation, urging good will to 
men and, please, artificial trees 
because of the fire danger in the 
event of H-bomb raids; in the 
middle of a sentence twenty mil- 
lion viewers had seen him stop, 
look dazedly around and say, in 
a breathless mumble, what 
sounded like: “Disht dvornyet 
ilgt.” He had then picked up the 



Bible on the desk before him and 
thrown it at the television 
camera. 

The last the televiewers had 
seen was the fluttering pages of 
the Book, growing larger as it 
crashed against the lens, then a 
flicker and a blinding shot of the 
studio lights as the cameraman 
jumped away and the instrument 
swiveled to stare mindlessly up- 
ward. Twenty minutes later the 
President was dead, as his Secre- 
tary of Health and Welfare, hur- 
rying with him back to the White 
House, calmly took a hand gren- 
ade from a Marine guard at the 
gate and blew the President’s 
party to fragments. 

For the President’s seizure was 
only the first and most conspicu- 
ous. “Disht dvornyet ilgt.” C.I.A. 
specialists were playing the tapes 
of the broadcast feverishly, elec- 
tronically cleaning the mumble 
and stir from the studio away 
from the words to try to learn, 
first, the language and second 
what the devil it meant; but the 
President who ordered it was 
dead before the first reel spun, 
and his successor was not quite 
sworn in when it became his time 
to die. The ceremony was inter- 
rupted for an emergency call 
from the War Room, where a 
very nearly hysterical four-star 
general was trying to explain 
why he had ordered the immedi- 
ate firing of every live missile in 



his command against Washing- 
ton, D. C. 

Over five hundred missiles 
were involved. In most of the 
sites the order was disobeyed, 
but in- six of them, unfortunately, 
unquestioning discipline won out, 
thus ending not only the swear- 
ing in, the general’s weeping ex- 
planation, the spinning of tapes, 
but also some two million lives in 
the District of Columbia, Mary- 
land, Virginia and (through 
malfunctioning relays on two 
missiles) Pennsylvania and Ver- 
mont. But it was only the begin- 
ning. 

f'T'HESE were the first cases of 
possession seen by the world 
in some five hundred years, since 
the great casting out of devils of 
the Middle Ages. A thousand 
more occurred in the next few 
days, a hundred in the next hours. 
The timetable was made up out 
of scattered reports in the wire- 
service newsrooms, while they 
still had facilities for spot cover- 
age in any part of the world. 
(That lasted almost a week.) 
They identified 237 cases of 
possession by noon of the next 
day. Disregarding the dubious 
items — the Yankee pitcher who 
leaped from the Manhattan 
bridge (he had Bright’s disease), 
the warden of San Quentin who 
seated himself in the gas cham- 
ber and, literally, kicked the 



bucket (did he know the Grand 
Jury was subpoenaing his 
books?) — disregarding these, 
the chronology of major cases 
that evening was: 

8:27 PM, E.S.T.: President has 
attack on television. 

8:28 PM, E.S.T.: Prime Min- 
ister of England orders bombing 
raid against Israel, alleging secret 
plot (order not carried out). 

8:28 PM, E.S.T.: Captain of 
SSN Ethan Allen, surfaced near 
Montauk Point, orders crash dive 
and course change, proceeding 
submerged at flank speed to New 
York Harbor. 

9:10 PM, E.S.T.: Eastern Air- 
lines six-engine jet makes wheels- 
up landing on roof of Pentagon, 
breaking some 1500 windows but 
causing no other major damage 
(except to the people aboard the 
jet); record of this incident frag- 
mentary because entire site 
charred black in fusion attack 
two hours later. 

9:23 PM, E.S.T.: Rosalie Pan, 
musical-comedy star, jumps off 
stage, runs up center aisle and 
vanishes in cab, wearing beaded 
bra, G-string and $2500 head- 
dress. Her movements are traced 
to Newark airport where she 
boards TWA jetliner, which is 
never seen again. 

9:50 PM, E.S.T.: Entire S.A.C. 
fleet of 1200 jet bombers takes 
off for rendezvous over New- 
foundland, where 72% are com- 



pelled to ditch as tankers fail to 
keep refueling rendezvous. (Or- 
ders committing the aircraft orig- 
inate with S.A.C. commander 
found to be a suicide.) 

10.14 PM, E.S.T.: Submarine 
fusion explosion destroys 40% Q f 
New York City. Analysis of fall- 
out indicates U.S. Navy Polaris 
missiles were detonated under- 
water in bay; by elimination it is 
deduced that the submarine was 
the Ethan Allen. 

10:50 PM, E.S.T.: President’s 
party assassinated by Secretary 
of Health, Education and Wel- 
fare; Secretary then dies on bay- 
onet of Marine guard who fur- 
nished the grenade. 

10:55 PM, E.S.T. Satellite 
stations observe great nuclear ex- 
plosions in China and Tibet. 

11:03 PM, E.S.T.: Heavily 

loaded munitions barges exploded 
near North Sea dikes of Holland; 
dikes breached, 1800 square miles 
of reclaimed land flooded out . 

And so on. The incidents were 
countless. But before long, before 
even the C.I.A. had finished the 
first playthrough of the tapes, be- 
fore their successors in the task 
identified Disht dvornyet ilgt as 
a Ukrainian dialect rendering of, 
My God, it works! — before all 
this, one fact was already ap- 
parent. There were many inci- 
dents scattered around the world, 
but not one of them took place 
in Russia itself. 



130 



GALAXY 



ARSAW was ablaze, China 
pockmarked with blasts, 
East Berlin demolished along 
with its western sector, in eight 
rounds fired from a U.S. Army 
nuclear cannon. But the U.S.S.R. 
had not suffered at all, as far as 
could be told by the prying eyes 
in orbit; and that fact was reason 
enough for it to suffer very great- 
ly very soon. 

Within minutes of this dis- 
covery what remained of the mil- 
itary strength of the Western 
world was roaring through airless 
space toward the most likely tar- 
gets of the East. 

One unscathed missile base in 
Alaska completed a full shoot, 
seven missiles with fusion war- 
heads. The three American bases 
that survived at all in the Med- 
iterranean fired what they had. 
Even Britain, which had already 
watched the fire-tails of the Amer- 
ican missiles departing on suicide 
missions, managed to resurrect its 
own two prototype Blue Streaks 
from their racks, where they had 
moldered since the cancellation 
of the British missile program. 
One of these museum-pieces de- 
stroyed itself in launching, but 
the other chugged painfully 
across the sky, the tortoise fol- 
lowing the flight of the hares. It 
arrived a full half-hour after the 
newer, hotter missiles. It might 
as well not have bothered. There 
was not much left to destroy. 



It was fortunate for the Com- 
munists that most of the Western 
arsenal had already spent itself 
in suicide. What was left wiped 
out Moscow, Leningrad and nine 
other cities. It was even fortunate 
for the whole world, for this was 
the Apocalypse they had dreaded, 
every possible nuclear weapon 
committed. But the circum- 
stances were such — hasty orders, 
often at once recalled; confusion; 
panic — that most were unfused, 
many others merely tore great 
craters in the quickly healing 
surface of the sea. The fallout 
was locally murderous but quite 
spotty. 

And the conventional forces in- 
vading Russia found nothing to 
fight. The Russians were as con- 
fused as they. There were not 
many survivors of the very top 
brass, and no one seemed to 
know just what had happened. 

Was the Secretary of the C.P., 
U.S.S.R. behind that terrible 
brief agony? As he was dead be- 
fore it was over, there was no 
way to tell. More than a quarter 
of a billion lives went into mush- 
room-shaped clouds, and nearly 
half of them were Russian, Latvi- 
an, Tatar and Kalmuck. The 
Peace Commission squabbled for 
a month, until the breakdown of 
communications cut them off from 
their governments and each 
other; and in that way, for a time, 
there was peace. 



PLAGUE OF PYTHONS 



131 



T HIS was the sort of peace that 
was left, thought Chandler 
looking around at the queer faces 
and queerer surroundings, the 
peace of medieval baronies, cut 
off from the world, untouched 
where the rain of fallout had 
passed by but hardly civilized 
any more. Even his own home 
town, trying to take his life in a 
form of law, reduced at last to tor- 
ture and exile to cast him out, 
was not the civilization he had 
grown up in but something new 
and ugly. 

There was a great deal of talk 
he did not understand because 
he could not quite hear it, though 
they looked at him. Then Guy, 
with the gun, led him up to the 
front of the room. They had con- 
structed an improvised platform 
out of plywood panels resting on 
squat, heavy boxes that looked 
like empty ammunition crates. On 
the dais was a dentist’s chair, 
bolted to the plywood; and in the 
chair, strapped in, baby spotlights 
on steel-tube frames glaring on 
her, was a girl. She looked at 
Chandler with regretting eyes 
but did not speak. 

“Stranger, get up there,” said 
Guy, prodding him from behind, 
and Chandler took a plain wood- 
en chair next to the girl. 

“People of Orphalese,” cried 
the teen-age cutie named Meggie, 
“we have two more brands to save 
from the imps!” 



The men and women in ^ 
audience cackled or shrilled 
“Save them! Save them!” They 
all had a look of invisible uni- 
forms, Chandler saw, like baseball 
players in the lobby of a hotel 
or soldiers in a diner outside the 
gate of their post; they were all 
of a type. Their type was some- 
thing strange. Some were tall, 
some short; there were old, fat, 
lean and young around them; but 
they all wore about them a look 
of glowing excitement, muted by 
an aura of suffering and pain. 
They wore, in a word, the look of 
bigots. 

The bound girl was not one of 
them. She might have been twen- 
ty years old or as much as thirty. 
She might have been pretty. It 
was hard to tell; she wore no 
makeup, her hair strung raggedly 
to her neck, and her face was 
drawn into a tight, lean line. It 
was her eyes that were alive. She 
saw Chandler and she was sorry 
for him. And he saw, as he turned 
to look at her, that she was man- 
acled to the dentist’s chair. 

“People of Orphalese,” chanted 
Guy, standing behind Chandler 
with the muzzle of the gun 
against his neck, “the meeting of 
the Orphalese Self-Preservation 
Society will now come to order.” 
There was an approving, hungry 
murmur from the audience. 

“Well, people of Orphalese,” 
Guy went on in his singsong, “the 



132 



GALAXY 



agenda for the day is first the 
salvation of we Orphalese on Mc- 
Guire’s Mountain.” 

(“All saved, all of us saved,” 
rolled a murmur from the con- 
gregation.”) A lean, red-headed 
man bounded to the platform and 
fussed wi(h the stand of spot- 
lights, turning one of them full 
on Chandler. 

“People of Orphalese, as we are 
saved, do I have your consent to 
pass on and proceed to the next 
order of business?” 

(“Consent, consent, consent,” 
rolled the echo.) 

“And then the second item of 
business is to welcome and bring 
to grace these two newly found 
and adopted souls.” 

The congregation shouted var- 
iously: “Bring them to grace! 

Save them from the imps! Keep 
Orphalese from the taint of the 
beast!” 

Evidently Guy was satisfied. 
He nodded and became more 
chatty. “Okay, people of Orpha- 
lese, let’s get down to it. We got 
two new ones, like I say. Their 
spirits have gone wandering on 
the wind, or anyway one of them 
has, and you all know the et cet- 
era. They have committed a 
wrong unto others and therefore 
unto themselves. Herself, I mean. 
Course, the other one could have 
a flame spirit in him too.” He 
stared severely at Chandler. 
“Boys, keep an eye on him, why 



don’t you?” he said to two men 
in the front row, surrendering his 
gun. “Meggie, you tell about the 
female one.” 

The teen-aged girl stepped for- 
ward and said, in a conversational 
tone but with modest pride, “Peo- 
ple of Orph’lese, well, I was walk- 
ing down the cut and I heard this 
car coming. Well, I was pretty 
surprised, you know. I had to 
figure what to do. You all know 
what the trouble is with cars.” 

“The imps!” cried a woman of 
forty with a face like a catfish. 

The girl nodded. “Most prob’ly. 
Well, I — I mean, people of 
Orph’lese, well, I was by the 
switchback where we keep the 
chevvy-freeze hid, so I just waited 
till I saw it slowing down for the 
curve — me out of sight, you 
know — and I rolled the chevvy- 
freeze out nice and it caught the 
wheels. Right over!” she cried 
gleefully. “Off the shoulder, 
people of Orph’lese, and into the 
ditch and over, and I didn’t give 
it a chance to burn. I cut the 
switch and I had her! I put a knife 
into her back, just a little, about 
a quarter of an inch, maybe. Her 
pain was the breakin’ of the shell 
that enclosed her understanding, 
like it says. I figured she was all 
right then because she yelled but 
I brought her along that way. 
Then Guy took care of her until 
we got the synod. Oh,” she re- 
membered, “and her tongue

staggered a little without purpose 
while he was putting it on, didn’t 
it, Guy?” The bearded man nod- 
ded, grinning, and lifted up the 
girl’s foot. Incredulously, Chand- 
ler saw that it was bound tight 
with a three-foot length of barbed 
wire, wound and twisted like a 
tourniquet, the blood black and 
congealed around it. He lifted his 
shocked eyes to meet the girl’s. 
She only looked at him, with pity 
and understanding. 

Guy patted the foot and let it 
go. “I didn’t have any more C- 
clamps, people of Orphalese,” he 
apologized, “but it looks all right 
at that. Well, let’s see. We got to 
make up our minds about these 
two, I guess — no, wait!” He held 
up his hand as a murmur began. 
“First thing is, we ought to read 
a verse or two.” 

He opened a purple-bound 
volume at random, stared at a 
page for a moment, moving his 
lips, and then read: 

“Some of you say, ‘It is the 
north wind who has woven the 
clothes we wear.’ 

“And I say, Ay, it was the north 
wind, but shame was his loom, 
and the softening of the sinews 
was his thread. 

“And when his work was done 
he laughed in the forest.” 

Gently he closed the book, 
looking thoughtfully at the wall 
at the back of the room. He 
scratched his head. “Well, people 



of Orphalese,” he said slowly 
“they’re laughing in the forest all 
right, I guarantee, but we’ve got 
one here that may be honest in 
the flesh, probably is, though she 
was a thief in the spirit. Right? 
Well, do we take her in or reject 
her, O people of Orphalese?” 

The audience muttered to it- 
self and then began to call out: 
“Accept! Oh, bring in the brand! 
Accept and drive out the imp!” 

“Fine,” said the teen-ager, rub- 
bing her hands and looking at the 
bearded man. “Guy, let her go.” 
He began to release her from the 
chair. “You, girl stranger, what’s 
your name?” 

The girl said faintly, “Ellen 
Braisted.” 

“ ‘Meggie, my name is Ellen 
Braisted,’ ” corrected the teen- 
ager. “Always say the name of 
the person you’re talkin’ to in 
Orph’lese, that way we know it’s 
you talkin’, not a flame spirit or 
wanderer. Okay, go sit down.” 
Ellen limped wordlessly down 
into the audience. “Oh, and peo- 
ple of Orph’lese,” said Meggie, 
“the car’s still there if we need it 
for anything. It didn’t burn. Guy, 
you go on with this other fellow.” 

Guy stroked his beard and as- 
sessed Chandler, looking him over 
carefully. “Okay,” he said. “Peo- 
ple of Orphalese, the third order 
of business is to welcome or re- 
ject this other brand saved from 
the imps, as may be your p/^as-

ure.” Chandler sat up straighter 
now that all of them were look- 
ing at him again; but it wasn’t 
quite his turn, at that, because 
there was an interruption. Guy 
never finished. From the valley, 
far below, there was a sudden 
mighty thunder, rolling among 
the mountains. The windows blew 
in with a crystalline crash. 

; 

TPHE room erupted into con- 
fusion, the audience leaping 
from their seats, running to the 
broad windows, Guy and the teen- 
age girl seizing rifles, everyone 
in motion at once. 

Chandler straightened, then 
sat down again. The red-headed 
man guarding him was looking 
away. It would be quite possible 
to grab his gun, run, get away 
from these maniacs. Yet he had 
nowhere to go. They might be 
crazy, but they seemed to have 
organization. 

They seemed, in fact, to have 
worked out, on whatever crazed 
foundation of philosophy, some 
practical methods for coping with 
possession. He decided to stay, 
wait and see. 

And at once he found himself 
leaping for the gun. 

No. Chandler didn’t find him- 
self attacking the red-headed 
man. He found his body doing it; 
Chandler had nothing to do with 
it. It was the helpless compulsion 
he had felt before, that had nearly 



cost him his life; his body active 
and urgent and his mind com- 
pletely cut off from it. He felt his 
own muscles move in ways he 
had not planned, observed him- 
self leap forward, felt his own fist 
strike at the back of the red- 
headed man’s ear. The man went 
spinning, the gun went flying, 
Chandler’s body leaped after it, 
with Chandler a prisoner in his 
own brain, watching, horrified 
and helpless. And he had the gun! 

He caught it in the hand that 
was his own hand, though some- 
one else was moving it; he raised 
it and half-turned. He was sud- 
denly conscious of a fusillade of 
gunfire ■ from the roof, and a 
scattered echo of guns all round 
the outside of the house. Part of 
him was surprised, another alien 
part was not. He started to shoot 
the teen-aged girl in the back of 
the head, silently shouting No! 

His fingers never pulled the 
trigger. 

He caught a second’s glimpse 
of someone just beside him, 
whirled and saw the girl, Ellen 
Braisted, limping swiftly toward 
him with her barbed-wire amulet 
loose and catching at her feet. In 
her hands was an axe-handle club 
caught up from somewhere. She 
struck at Chandler’s head, with 
a face like an eagle’s, impersonal 
and determined. The blow caught 
him and dazed him, and from be- 
hind someone else struck him with 



PLAGUE OF PYTHONS 



135 



something else. He went down. 

He heard shouts and firing, but 
he was stunned. He felt himself 
dragged and dropped. He saw a 
cloudy, misty girl’s face hanging 
over him; it receded and re- 
turned. Then a frightful blister- 
ing pain in his hand startled him 
back into full consciousness. 

It was the girl, Ellen, still there, 
leaning over him and, oddly, 
weeping. And the pain in his 
hand was the burning flame of 
a kitchen match. Ellen was doing 
it, his wrist in one hand, a burn- 
ing match held to it with the 
other. 

IV 

/'''HANDLER yelled hoarsely, 
^ jerking his hand away. 

She dropped the match and 
jumped up, stepping on the flame 
and watching him. She had a 
butcher knife that had been 
caught between her elbow and her 
body while she burned him. Now 
she put her hand on the knife, 
waiting. “Does it hurt?” she de- 
manded tautly. 

Chandler howled, with incred- 
ulity and rage: “God damn it, 
yes! What did you expect?” 

“I expected it to hurt,” she 
agreed. She watched him for a 
moment more and then, for the 
first time since he had seen her, 
she smiled. It was a small smile, 
but a beginning. A fusillade of 



shots from outside wiped it away 
at once. “Sorry,” she said. “I had 
to do that. Please trust me.” 

“Why did you have to burn 
my hand?” 

“House rules,” she said. “Keeps 
the flame-spirits out, you know. 
They can’t stand pain.” She took 
her hand off the knife warily. “It 
still hurts, doesn’t it?” 

“It still does, yes,” nodded 
Chandler bitterly, and she lost 
interest in him and got up, look- 
ing about the room. Three of the 
Orphalese were dead, or seemed 
to be from the casual poses in 
which they lay draped across a 
chair on the floor. Some of the 
others might have been freshly 
wounded, though it was hard to 
tell the casualties from the others 
in view of the Orphalese custom 
of self-inflicted pain. There was 
still firing going on outside and 
overhead, and a shooting-gallery 
smell of burnt powder in the air. 
The girl, Ellen Braisted, limped 
back with the butcher knife held 
carelessly in one hand. She was 
followed by the teen-ager, who 
wore a smile of triumph — and, 
Chandler noticed for the first 
time, a sort of tourniquet of 
barbed-wire on her left forearm, 
the flesh puffy red around it. 
“Whopped ’em,” she said with 
glee, and pointed a .22 rifle at 
Chandler. 

Ellen Braisted said, “Oh, he — 
Meggie, I mean, he’s all right.” 



I She pointed at his burned palm. 
I Meg approached him with com- 
I petent care, the rifle resting on 
I her good right forearm and aimed 
at him as she examined his burn. 
She pursed her lips and looked 
at his face. “All right, Ellen, I 
guess he’s clean. But you want to 
burn ’em deeper’n that. Never 
pays to go easy, just means we’ll 
have to do something else to ’im 
tomorrow.” 

“The hell you will,” thought 
Chandler, and all but said it; but 
reason stopped him. In Rome he 
would have to do Roman deeds. 
Besides, maybe their ideas 
worked. Besides, he had until to- 
morrow to make up his mind 
about what he wanted to do. 

“Ellen, show him around,” or- 
dered the teen-ager. “I got no 
time myself. Shoosh! Almost got 
us that time, Ellen. Got to be 
more careful, cause the white- 
handed aren’t clean, you know.” 
She strutted away, the rifle at 
trail. She seemed to be enjoying 
herself very much. 

HPHE name of the girl in the 
•*- barbed-wire bracelet was El- 
len Braisted. She came from 
Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, 
and Chandler’s first wonder was 
what she was doing nearly three 
thousand miles from home. 

Nobody liked to travel much 
these days. One place was as bad 
as another, except that in the 

PLAGUE OF PYTHONS 



place where you were known you 
could perhaps count on friends 
and as a stranger you were prob- 
able fair game anywhere else. Of 
course, there was one likely 
reason for travel. 

She didn’t like to talk about 
it, that was clear, but that was 
the reason. She had been pos- 
sessed. When the teen-ager 
trapped her car the day before 
she had been the tool of another’s 
will. She had had a dozen sub- 
machine guns in the trunk and 
she had meant to deliver them to 
a party of hunters in a valley just 
south of McGuire’s Mountain. 
Chandler said, with some effort, 
“I must have been — ” 

“Ellen, I must have been,” she 
corrected. 

“Ellen, I must have been pos- 
sessed too, just now. When I 
grabbed the gun.” 

“Of course. First time?” 

He shook his head. For some 
reason the brand on his forehead 
began to throb. 

“Well, then you know. Look 
out here, now.” 

They were at the great pier 
windows that looked out over the 
valley. Down below was the river, 
an arc of the railroad tracks, the 
wooded mountainside he had 
scaled. “Over there, Chandler.” 
She was pointing to the railroad 
bridge. 

Wispy gray smoke drifted off 
southward toward the stream. 



136

137 



The freight train Chandler had 
ridden on had been stopped, all 
that time, in the middle of the 
bridge. The explosion that blew 
out their windows had occurred 
when another train plowed into 
it — evidently at high speed. It 
seemed that one of the trains had 
carried some sort of chemicals. 
The bridge was a twisted mess. 

“A diversion, Chandler,” said 
Ellen Braisted. “They wanted us 
looking that way. Then they at- 
tacked from up the mountain.” 
“Who?” 

Ellen looked surprised. “The 
men that crashed the trains . 
if they are men. The ones who 
possessed me — and you — and 
the hunters. They don’t like these 
Orphalese, I think. Maybe they’re 
a little afraid of them. I think the 
Orphalese have a pretty good 
idea of how to fight them.” 

Chandler felt a sudden flash of 
sensation along his nerves. For a 
moment he thought he had been 
possessed again, and then he 
knew it for what it was. It was 
hope. “Ellen, I never thought of 
fighting them. I thought that was 
given up two years ago.” 

“So maybe you agree with me? 
Maybe you think it’s worth while 
sticking with the Orphalese?” 
Chandler allowed himself the 
contemplation of what hope 
meant. To find someone in this 
world who had a plan! Whatever 
the plan was. Even if it was a 



bad plan. He didn’t think specific, 
ally of himself, or the brand on 
his forehead or the memory 0 f 
the body of his wife. What he 
thought of was the prospect 0 f 
thwarting — not even defeating, 
merely hampering or annoying 
was enough! — the imps, the 
“flame creatures,” the pythons 
devils, incubi or demons who had 
destroyed a world he had thought 
very fair. 

“If they’ll have me,” he said, 
“I’ll stick with them, all right. 
Where do I go to join?” 

TT was not hard to join at all. 

Meg chattily informed him 
that he was already practically a 
member. “Chandler, we got to 
watch everybody strange, you 
know. See why, don’t you? Might 
have a flame spirit in ’em, no fault 
of theirs, but look how they could 
mess us up. But now we know 
you don’t, so — What do you 
mean, how do we know? Cause 
you did have one when you busted 
loose in there. Can’t have two at 
a time, you know. Think we 
couldn’t tell the difference?” 
The interrupted meeting was 
resumed after the place had been 
tidied up and the dead buried. 
There had been four of the hunt- 
ers, and even without their sub- 
machine guns they had succeeded 
in killing eight Orphalese. But it 
was not all loss to the Orphalese, 
because two of the hunters were

[ still alive, though wounded, and 
under the rules of this chessboard 
the captured enemy became a 
friend. 

Guy had suffered a broken jaw 
in the scuffle and another man 
| presided, a fat youth who favored 
a bandaged leg. He limped to his 
f feet, grimacing and patting his 
leg. “O Orphalese and brothers,” 
he said, “we have lost friends, but 
we have won a test. Praise the 
Prophet, we will be spared to win 
again, and to drive the imps of 
fire out of our world. Meggie, you 
going to tie these folks up?” The 
girl proudly ordered one of the 
hunters into the spotlighted den- 
tist’s chair, another into a wing 
chair that was hastily moved onto 
the platform. The men were 
bleeding and hurt, but they had 
clearly been abandoned by their 
possessors. They watched with 
puzzlement and fear. 

“Walter, they’re okay now,” 
Meg reported as others finished 
tying up the hunters. “Oh, wait 
a minute.” She advanced on 
Chandler. “Chandler, I’m sorry. 
You sit down there, hear?” 

Chandler suffered himself to 
be bound to a camp chair on the 
platform and Walter took a drink 
of wine and opened the ornate 
book that was before him on the 
rostrum. 

“Meg, thanks. Guy, I hope I do 
this as good as you do. Let me 
read you a little. Let’s see.” He 



put on his steel-rimmed glasses 
and read: 

“Much in you is still man, and 
much in you is not yet man, but 
a shapeless pigmy that walks 
asleep in the mist searching for 
its own awakening.” 

He closed the book, looked 
with satisfaction at Guy and 
said : “Do you understand that, 
new friends? They are the words 
of the Prophet, who men call 
Kahlil Gibran. For the benefit of 
the new folks I ought to say that 
he died this fleshly life quite a 
good number of years ago, but 
his vision was unclouded. Like we 
say, we are the sinews that batter 
the flame spirits but he is our 
soul.” There was an antiphonal 
murmur from the audience and 
Walter flipped the pages again 
rapidly, obviously looking for a 
familiar passage. “People of Or- 
phalese, here we are now. This’s 
what he says. What is this that 
has torn our world apart? The 
Prophet says: “It is life in quest 
of life, in bodies that fear the 
grave.” Now, honestly, nothing 
could be clearer than that, people 
of Orphalese and friends! We got 
something taking possession of 
us, see? What is it? Well, he says 
here, people of Orphalese and 
friends, ‘It is a flame spirit in you 
ever gathering more of itself.’ 
Now, what the heck! Nobody can 
blame us for what a flame spirit 
in us does! So the first thing we 



PLAGUE OF PYTHONS 



139 



got to learn, friends — and 
people of Orphalese — is, we 
aren’t to blame. And the second 
thing is, we are to blame!” 

He turned and grinned at 
Chandler kindly, while the cho- 
rus of responses came from the 
room, “Like here,” he said, 
. “people of Orphalese, the Proph- 
et says everybody is guilty. ‘The 
murdered is not unaccountable 
for his own murder, and the 
robbed is not blameless in being 
robbed. The righteous is not in- 
nocent of the deeds of the wick- 
ed, and the white-handed is not 
clean in the doings of the felon.’ 
You see what he’s getting at? 
We all got to take the respon- 
sibility for everything — - and 
that means we got to suffer — 
but we don’t have to worry about 
any special things we did when 
some flame spirit or wanderer, 
like, took us over. 

“But we do have to suffer, 
people of Orphalese.” His expres- 
sion became grim. “Our beloved 
founder, Guy, who’s sitting there 
doing a little extra suffering now, 
was favored enough to under- 
stand these things in the very 
beginning, when he himself was 
seized by these imps. And it is all 
in this book! Like it says, ‘Your 
pain is self-chosen. It is the bitter 
potion by which the physician 
within you heals your sick self.’ 
Ponder on that, people of Or- 
phalese — and friends. No, I 



mean really ponder,” he ex 
plained, glancing at the bound 
“friends” on the platform. “w e 
always do that for a minute. Ada 
there will play us some music so 
we can ponder.” 

/^HANDLER shifted uncorn- 
^ fortably, while an old woman 
crippled by arthritis began fum- 
bling a tune out of an electric 
organ. The burn Ellen Braisted 
had given him was beginning to 
hurt badly. If only these people 
were not such obvious nuts, he 
thought, he would feel a lot better 
about casting his lot in with them. 
But maybe it took lunatics to do 
the job. Sane people hadn’t ac- 
complished much. 

And anyway he had very little 
choice . 

“Ada, that’s enough,” ordered 
the fat youth. “Meg, come on up 
here. People of Orphalese, now 
you can listen again while Meg 
explains to the new folks how all 
this got started, seeing Guy’s in 
no condition to do it.” 

The teen-ager marched up to 
the platform and took the parade- 
rest position learned in some 
high-school debating society — in 
the days when there were debat- 
ing societies and high schools. 
“Ladies and gentlemen, well, let’s 
start at the beginning. Guy tells 
this better’n I do, of course, but 
I guess I remember it all pretty 
well too. I ought to. I was in on 



140 



GALAXY 



it and all.” She grimaced and 
said, “Well, anyway, ladies and 
gentlemen — people of Orph’lese 
. — the way Guy organized this 
Orphalese self-protection society 
was, like Walter says, he was pos- 
sessed. The only difference be- 
tween Guy and you and me was 
that ha knew what to do about 
it, because he read the book, you 
see. Not that that helped him at 
first, when he was took over. He 
was really seized. Yes, people of 
Orph’lese, he was taken and while 
his whole soul and brain and body 
was under the influence of some 
foul wanderer fiend from hell he 
did things that, ladies and gentle- 
men of Orph’lese, I wouldn’t want 
to tell you. He was a harp in 
the hand of the mighty, as it says. 
Couldn’t help it, not however 
much he tried. Only while he was 
doing — the things — he hap- 
pened to catch his hand in a gas 
flame and, well, you can see it 
was pretty bad.” With a depreca- 
tory smile Guy held up a twisted 
hand. “And, do you know, he was 
free of his imp right then and 
there! Now, Guy is a scientist, 
people of Orph’lese, he worked 
for the telephone company, and 
he not only had that training in 
the company school but he had 
read the book, you see, and he put 
two and two together. Oh, and 
he’s my uncle, of course. I’m 
proud of him. I’ve always loved 
him, and even when he — when 



he was not one with himself, you 
know, when he was doing those 
terrible things to me, I knew it 
wasn’t Uncle Guy that was doing 
them, but something else. I didn’t 
know what, though. And when he 
told me he had figured out the 
Basic Rule, I went along with 
him every bit. I knew Guy wasn’t 
wrong, and what he said was from 
Scripture. Imps fear pain! So we 
got to love it. That one I know 
by heart, all right: ‘Could you 
keep your heart from wonder at 
the daily miracles of your life, 
your pain would not seem less 
wondrous than your joy.’ That’s 
what it says, right? So that’s why 
we got to hurt ourselves, people 
of Orph’lese — and new brothers 
— because the wanderers don’t 
like it when we hurt and they 
leave us alone. Simple’s that. 

“Well — ” the girl’s face stif- 
fened momentarily — “I knew I 
wasn’t going to be seized. So Guy 
and I got Else, that’s the other 
girl he’d been doing things to, 
and we knew she wasn’t going 
to be taken either. Not if the imps 
feared pain like Guy said, be- 
cause,” she said solemnly, “I want 
to tell you Guy hurt us pretty 
bad. 

“And then we came out here, 
and found this place, and ever 
since then we’ve been adding 
brothers and sisters. It’s been 
slow, of course, because not many 
people come this way any more, 



PLAGUE OF PYTHONS 



141 



and we’ve had to kill a lot. Yes, 
we have. Sometimes the possessed 
just can’t be saved, but — ” 

Abruptly her face changed. 

Suddenly alert, her face years 
older, she glanced around the 
room. Then she relaxed . 

And screamed. 

leaped up. Hoarsely, his 
voice almost inarticulate as 
he tried to talk with his broken 
jaw, he cried, “Wha . Wha’s . 
matter, Meg? 

“Uncle Guy!” she wailed. She 
plunged off the platform and flung 
herself into his arms, crying hys- 
terically. 

“Wha?” 

She sobbed, “I could feel it! 
They took me. Guy, you prom- 
ised me they couldn’t!” 

He shook his head, dazed, 
staring at her as though she were 
indeed possessed — -still possessed, 
and telling him some fearful 
great lie to destroy his hopes. He 
seemed unable to comprehend 
what she had said. One of the 
hunters bellowed in stark fear: 
“For God’s sake, untie us! Give 
us a chance, anyway!” Chandler 
yelled agreement. In one split 
second everyone in the room had 
been transmuted by terror into 
something less than human. No 
one seemed capable of any action. 
Slowly the plump youth who had 
presided moved over to the hunt- 
er bound in the dentist’s chair and 



began to fumble blindly at the 
knots. Ellen Braisted dropped 
her head into her hands and be- 
gan to shake. 

The cruelty of the moment was 
that they had all tasted hope. 
Chandler writhed wildly against 
his ropes, his mind racing out of 
control. The world had become 
a hell for everyone, but a bearable 
hell until the promise of a chance 
to end it gave them a full sight 
of what their lives had been. Now 
that that was dashed they were 
far worse off than before. 

Walter finished with the hunt- 
er and lethargically began to pick 
at Chandler’s bonds. His face was 
slack and unseeing. 

Then it, too, changed. 

The plump youth stood up 
sharply, glanced about, and 
walked off the platform. 

Ellen Braisted raised her face 
from her hands and, her eyes 
streaming, quietly stood up and 
followed. The old lady with the 
arthritis about-faced and limped 
with them. Chandler stared, puz- 
zled, and then comprehended. 

They were marching toward 
the corner of the room where the 
rifles were stacked. “Possessed!” 
Chandler bellowed, the words 
tasting of acid as they ripped out 
of his throat. “Stop them! You — 
Guy — look!” He flailed wildly 
at his loosened bonds, lunged, 
tottered and toppled, chair and 
all, crashingly off the platform. 



142 



GALAXY 



The three possessed ones did 
not need to hurry. They had all 
the time in the world. They were 
already reaching out for the rifles 
when Chandler shouted. Econom- 
ically they turned, raising the 
butts to their shoulders, and began 
to fire at the Orphalese. It was 
a queerly frightening sight to see 
the arthritic organist, with a face 
like a relaxed executioner, take 
quick aim at Guy and, with a 
thirty-thirty shell, blow his throat 
out. Three shots, and the nearest 
three of the congregation were 
dead. Three more, and others 
went down, while the remainder 
turned and tried to run. It was 
like a slaughter of vermin. They 
never had a chance. 

When every Orphalese except 
themselves was down on the 
floor, dead, wounded or, like 
Chandler, overlooked, the arthrit- 
ic lady took careful aim at Ellen 
Braisted and the plump youth 
and shot them neatly in the tem- 
ples.- They didn’t try to prevent 
her. With expressions that seemed 
almost impatient they presented 
their profiles to her aim. 

Then the arthritic lady glanced 
leisurely about, fired into the 
stomach of a wounded man who 
was trying to rise, reloaded her 
rifle for insurance and began to 
search the bodies of the nearest 
dead. She was looking for mat- 
ches. When she found them, she 
tugged weakly at the upholstery 



on a couch, swore and began 
methodically to rip and crumple 
pages out of Kahlil Gibran. When 
she had a heap of loose papers 
piled against the dais she pitched 
the remainder of the book out of 
the window, knelt and ignited the 
crumpled heap. 

She stood watching the fire, 
her expression angry and impa- 
tient, tapping her foot. 

The crumpled pages burned 
briskly. Before they died the 
wooden dais was beginning to 
catch. Laboriously the old lady 
toted folding chairs to pile on the 
blaze until it was roaring hand- 
somely. 

She watched it for several min- 
utes, until it was a great orange 
pillar of fire sweeping to the ceil- 
ing, until the drapes on the wall 
behind were burning and the 
platform was a holocaust, until 
the noise of crackling flame and 
the beginning of plaster falling 
from the high ceiling proved that 
there was no likelihood of the fire 
going out and, indeed, no way to 
put it out without a complete fire 
department arriving on the scene 
at once. 

The old lady’s expression 
cleared. She nodded to herself. 
She then put the muzzle of the 
rifle in her mouth and, with her 
thumb, pulled the trigger that 
blew the top of her head off. The 
body fell into the flames, but it 
was by then already dead.

/'''HANDLER had not been shot, 
^ but he was very near to 
roasting. Walter had released 
one hand and, while the pos- 
sessed woman’s attention was 
elsewhere, Chandler had worked 
on the other knots. 

When he saw her commit sui- 
cide he redoubled his efforts. It 
was incredible to him that his 
life had been saved, and he knew 
that if he escaped the flames he 
still had nothing to live for — 
that blasted brief hope had 
broken his spirit — but his fingers 
had a will of their own. 

He lay there, struggling, while 
great black clouds of smoke, 
orange painted from the flames, 
gathered under the high ceiling, 
while the thunder of falling lumps 
of plaster sounded like a child 
heaving volumes of the Encyclo- 
pedia Britannica down a flight of 
stairs, while the heat and short- 
age of oxygen made him breathe 
in violent spasms. Then he cried 
out sharply and stumbled to his 
feet. It was only a matter of mo- 
ments before he was out of the 
house, but it was very nearly not 
time enough. 

Behind him was a great, sus- 
tained crash. He thought it must 
have been the furniture on the 
upper floor toppling through the 
burned-out ceiling of the hall. He 
turned and looked. 

It was dark, and now every 
window on the side of the house 



facing him was lighted. It was as 
though some mad householder 
had decided to equip his rooms 
only with orange lights, orange 
lights that flickered and moved. 
For a second Chandler thought 
there were still living people in 
the rooms — shapes moved and 
cavorted at the windows, as 
though they were gathering up 
possessions or waving wildly for 
help. But it was only the drapes, 
aflame, tossed about in the fierce 
heat. 

Chandler sighed and turned 
away. 

Pain was not a sure defense 
after all. Evidently it was only 
an annoyance to the possessors 
. whoever, or whatever, they 
might be. As soon as they had 
become suspicious they had ex- 
erted themselves and destroyed 
the Orphalese. He listened and 
looked about, but no one else 
moved. He had not expected any- 
one. He had been sure that he was 
the only survivor. 

He began to walk down the 
hill toward the wrecked railway 
bridge, turning only when a roar 
told him that the roof of the 
house had fallen in. A tulip of 
flame a hundred feet tall rose 
above the standing walls, and 
above that a shower of floating 
red-orange sparks, heat-borne, 
drifting up and away and begin- 
ning to settle all over the moun- 
tainside. Many were still red when 



PLAGUE OF PYTHONS

Ilf! 

they landed, a few still flaming. 
It was a distinct risk that the 
trees would begin to burn, and 
then he would be in fresh danger. 
So great was his stupor that he 
did not even hurry. 

By a plowed field he flung 
himself to the ground. 

He could go no farther because 
he had nowhere to go. He had 
had two homes and he had been 
driven from both of them, He 
had had hope twice, and twice 
he had been damned. 

He lay on his back, with the 
burning house mumbling and 
crackling in the distance, and 
stared up at the orange-lit tops of 
the trees and, past them, the 
stars. Over his left shoulder De- 
neb chased Vega across the sky; 
toward his feet something moved 
between the bright rosy dot that 
was Antares and another, the 
same brightness and hue — Mars? 
He spent several moments won- 
dering if Mars were in that part 
of the heavens. Then he looked 
again for the tiny moving point 
that had crossed the claws of the 
Scorpion, but it was gone. A sat- 
ellite, maybe. Although there 
were few of them left that the 
naked eye could hope to see. And 
there would never be any more, 
because the sort of accumulated 
wealth of nations that threw 
rockets into the sky was forever 
spent. 

It was probably an airplane, he 



thought drowsily, and drifted off 
to sleep without realizing how re- 
mote even that possibility had 
become . He woke up to find 
that he was getting to his feet. 

Once again an interloper ten- 
anted his brain. He tried to in- 
terfere, for he could not help it, 
although he knew how useless it 
was, but his own neck muscles 
turned his head from side to side, 
his own eyes looked this way and 
that, his own hand reached down 
for a dead branch that lay on the 
ground, then hesitated and with- 
drew. His body stood motionless 
for a second, the lips moving, the 
larynx mumbling to itself. He 
could almost hear words. Chand- 
ler felt like a fly in amber, pris- 
oned in his own brainbox. He was 
not surprised when his legs moved 
to carry him back toward the 
destroyed building, now a fakir’s 
bed of white-hot coals with brush 
fires spattered around it. He 
thought he knew why. It seemed 
very likely that what possessor 
had him was a sort of clean-up 
squad, tidying up the loose ends 
of the slaughter; he expected that 
his body’s errand was to destroy 
itself, and thus him, as all the 
Orphalese had been destroyed. 

V 

/"’HANDLER’S body carried 
^ him rapidly toward the house. 
Now and then it paused and 



146 



GALAXY 



glanced about. It seemed to be 
weighing some shortcut in its er- 
rand; but always it resumed its 
climb. 

Chandler could sympathize 
with it, in a way. He still felt 
every pain from burn, brand and 
wound; as they neared the em- 
bers of the building the heat it 
threw off intensified them all. He 
could not be a comfortable body 
to inhabit for long. He was almost 
sympathetic because his tenant 
could not find a convenient weap- 
on with which to fulfill his pur- 
pose. 

When it seemed they could get 
no closer without the skin of his 
face crackling and bursting into 
flame his body halted. 

Chandler could feel his mus- 
cles gathering for what would be 
the final leap into the auto-da-fe. 
His feet took a short step — and 
slipped. His body stumbled and 
recovered itself; his mouth swore 
thickly in a language he did not 
know. 

Then his body hesitated, 
glanced at the ground, paused 
again and bent down. It had 
tripped on a book. It picked the 
book up, and Chandler saw that 
it was the Orphalese copy of 
Gibran’s The Prophet. 

Chandler’s body stood poised 
for a moment, in an attitude of 
thought. Then it sat down, in the 
play of heat from the coals. It 
was a moment before Chandler 



realized he was free. He tested 
his legs; they worked; he got up, 
turned and began to walk away. 

He had traveled no more than 
a few yards when he stumbled 
slightly, as though shifting gears, 
and felt the tenant in his mind 
again. 

He continued to walk away 
from the building, down toward 
the road. Once his arm raised the 
book he still carried and his eyes 
glanced down, as if for reassur- 
ance that it was the same book. 
That was the only clue he was 
given as to what had happened 
and it was not much. It was as 
though his occupying power, 
whatever it was, had gone — 
somewhere — to think things over, 
perhaps to ask a question of an 
unimaginable companion, and 
then returned with an altered 
purpose. As time passed, Chand- 
ler began to receive additional 
clues, but he was in little shape 
to fit them together, for his body 
was near exhaustion. 

He walked to the road, and 
waited, rigid, until a panel truck 
came bouncing along. He hailed 
it, his arms making a sign he did 
not understand, and when it stop- 
ped he addressed the driver in 
a language he did not speak. 
“Shto,” said the driver, a somber- 
faced Mexican in dungarees. “Ja 
nie jestem Ruska. Czego prag- 
niesh?” 

“Czy ty jedziesz to Los Ange- 



PLAGUE OF PYTHONS 



147 



les?” asked Chandler’s mouth. 

“Nyet. Acapulco.” 

Chandler’s voice argued, 'Wes 
na Los Angeles.” 

“Nyet.” The voices droned on. 
Chandler lost interest in the ar- 
gument and was only relieved 
when it seemed somehow to be 
settled and he was herded into the 
back of the truck. The somber 
Mexican locked him in; he felt 
the truck begin to move; his 
tenant left him, and he was at 
once asleep. 

He woke long enough to find 
himself standing in the mist of 
early dawn at a crossroads. In a 
few minutes another car came 
by, and his voice talked earnestly 
with the driver for a moment. 
Chandler got in, was released, 
slept again and woke to find him- 
self free and abandoned, sprawled 
across the back seat of the car, 
which was parked in front of a 
building marked Los Angeles In- 
ternational Airport. 

/"'’HANDLER got out of the car 
^ and strolled around, stretch- 
ing. He realized he was very 
hungry. 

No one was in sight. The field 
showed clear signs of having been 
through the same sort of destruc- 
tion that had visited every major 
communications facility in the 
world. Part of the building before 
him was smashed flat and showed 
signs of having been burned. He 



saw projecting aluminum mem- 
bers, twisted and scorched but 
still visibly aircraft parts. Appar- 
ently a transport had crashed in- 
to the building. Burned-out cars 
littered the parking lot and what 
had once been a green lawn. They 
seemed to have been bulldozed 
out of the way, but not an inch 
farther than was necessary to 
clear the approach roads. 

To his right, as he stared out 
onto the field, was a strange- 
looking construction on three 
legs, several stories high. It did 
not seem to serve any useful pur- 
pose. Perhaps it had been a sort 
of luxury restaurant at one time, 
like the Space Needle from the 
old Seattle Fair, but now it too 
was burned out and glassless in 
its windows. The field itself was 
swept bare except for two or 
three parked planes in the bays, 
but he could see wrecked trans- 
ports lining the approach strips. 
All in all, Los Angeles Interna- 
tional Airport appeared to be 
serviceable, but only just. 

He wondered where all the 
people were. 

Distant truck noises answered 
part of the question. An Army 
six by six came bumping across 
a bridge that led from the takeoff 
strips to this parking area of the 
airport. Five men got out next 
to one of the ships. They glanced 
at him but did not speak as they 
began loading crates of some sort 



148 



GALAXY 



of goods from the truck into the 
aircraft, a four-engine, swept- 
wing jet of what looked to Chand- 
ler like an obsolete model. Per- 
haps it was one of the early 
Boeings. There hadn’t been many 
of those in use at the time the 
troubles began, too big and fast 
for short hops, too slow to com- 
pete over long distances with the 
rockets. But, of course, with all 
the destruction, and with no new 
aircraft being built anywhere in 
the world any more, no doubt 
they were as good as could be 
found. 

The truckmen did not seem to 
be possessed; they worked with 
the normal amount of grunting 
and swearing, pausing to wipe 
sweat away or to scratch an itch. 
They showed neither the intense 
malevolent concentration nor the 
wide-eyed idiot curiosity of those 
whose bodies were no longer 
their own. Chandler settled the 
woolen cap over the brand on his 
forehead, to avoid unpleasantness, 
and drifted over toward them. 

They stopped work and re- 
garded him. One of them said 
something to another, who nod- 
ded and walked toward Chand- 
ler. “What do you want?” he 
demanded warily. 

“I don’t know. I was going to 
ask you the same question, I 
guess.” 

The man scowled. “Didn’t your 
exec tell you what to do?” 



“My what?” 

The man paused, scratched and 
shook his head. “Well, stay away 
from us. This is an important 
shipment, see? I guess you’re all 
right or you couldn’t’ve got past 
the guards, but I don’t want you 
messing us up. Got enough 
trouble already. I don’t know 
why,” he said in the tones of an 
old grievance, “we can’t get the 
execs to let us know when they’re 
going to bring somebody in. It 
wouldn’t hurt them! Now here 
we got to load and fuel this ship 
and, for all I know, you’ve got 
half a ton of junk around some- 
where that you’re going to load 
onto it. How do I know how much 
fuel it’ll take? No weather, natu- 
rally. So if there’s headwinds it’ll 
take full tanks, but if there’s ex- 
tra cargo I — ” 

“The only cargo I brought 
with me that I can think of is 
a book,” said Chandler. “Weighs 
maybe a pound. You think I’m 
supposed to get on that plane?” 

The man grunted non-commit- 
tally. 

“All right, suit yourself. Listen, 
is there any place I can get some- 
thing to eat?” 

The man considered. “Well, I 
guess we can spare you a sand- 
wich. But you wait here. I’ll bring 
it to you.” 

He went back to the truck. A 
moment later one of the others 
brought Chandler two cold ham- 



PLAGUE OF PYTHONS

burgers wrapped in waxed paper, 
but would answer no questions. 

/"'HANDLER ate every crumb, 
Sought and found a wash- 
room in the wrecked building, 
came out again and sat in the 
sun, watching the loading crew. 
He had become quite a fatalist. 
It did not seem that it was in- 
tended he should die immediate- 
ly, so he might as well live. 

There were large gaps in his 
understanding, but it seemed 
clear to Chandler that these men, 
though not possessed, were in 
some way working for the pos- 
sessors. It was a distasteful con- 
cept; but on second thought it 
had reassuring elements. It was 
evidence that whatever the 
“execs” were, they were very pos- 
sibly human beings — or, if not 
precisely human, at least shared 
the human trait of working by 
some sort of organized effort to- 
ward some sort of a goal. It was 
the first non-random phenomenon 
he had seen in connection with 
the possessors, barring the short- 
term tactical matters of mass 
slaughter and destruction. It made 
him feel — what he tried at once 
to suppress, for he feared another 
destroying frustration — a touch 
of hope. 

The men finished their work 
but did not leave. Nor did they 
approach Chandler, but sat in 
the shade of their truck, waiting 



for something. He drowsed and 
was awakened by a distant sput- 
ter of a single-engined Aerocoupe 
that hopped across the building 
behind him, turned sharply and 
came down with a brisk little run 
in the parking bay itself. 

From one side the pilot climbed 
down and from the other two men 
lifted, with great care, a wooden 
crate, small but apparently heavy. 
They stowed it in the jet while 
the pilot stood watching; then the 
pilot and one of the other men 
got into the crew compartment. 
Chandler could not be sure, but 
he "had the impression that the 
truckman who entered the plane 
was no longer his own master. 
His movements seemed more sure 
and confident, but above all it 
was the mute, angry eyes with 
which his fellows regarded him 
that gave Chandler grounds for 
suspicion. He had no time to 
worry about that; foi; in the same 
breath he felt himself occupied 
once more. 

He did not rise. His own voice 
said to him, “You. Votever you 
name, you fellow vit de book! 
You go get de book verever. you 
pud it and get on dat ship dere, 
you see?” His eyes turned toward 
the waiting aircraft. “And don’t 
forget de book!” 

He was released. “I won’t,” he 
said automatically, and then re- 
alized that there was no longer 
anyone there to hear his answer.

When he retrieved the Gibran 
volume from the car and ap- 
proached the plane the loading 
| crew said nothing. Evidently they 
knew what he was doing — either 
because they too had been given 
[ instructions, or because they 
r r were used to such things. He 
paused at the wheeled stairs. 
“Listen,” he said, “can you at 
least tell me where I’m going?” 

The four remaining men looked 
at him silently, with the same 
t angry, worried expression he had 
i seen on their faces before. They 
I did not answer, but after a mo- 
ment one of them raised his arm 
t and pointed. 

West. Out toward the Pacific. 
Out toward some ten million 
square miles of nearly empty sea. 

T ONG before they reached 
their destination Chandler 
had reasoned what it must be. He 
was correct: It was the islands of 
Hawaii. 

Chandler knew that the pilot 
and his coopted partner were up 
forward, in the crew compart- 
ment, but the door was locked 
and he never saw them again. 
Apart from them he was the only 
living person on the plane. 

The plane was lightly loaded 
with cargo of unidentifiable sorts. 
In the rear section, where once 
tourist-class passengers had eaten 
their complimentary tray meals 
and planned their vacations, the 

PLAGUE OF PYTHONS 



seats had been removed and a 
thin scatter of crates and boxes 
were strapped to the floor. In the 
luxury of the forward section 
Chandler sat, stared at the water 
and drowsed. He seemed to be 
always sleepy. Perhaps it was the 
consequence of his exertions; 
more likely it was a psychological 
phenomenon. He was beyond 
worry. He had reached that point 
in emotional fatigue when the 
sudden rattle of cannonfire or the 
enemy’s banzai charge can no 
longer flood the blood with adren- 
alin. The glands are dry. The 
emotions have been triggered too 
often. Battle fatigue takes men 
in many different ways, but in 
Chandler it was only apathy. He 
not only could not worry, he 
could not even rouse himself to 
feel hunger, although the prick- 
ing of habit made him get up and 
search the flight kitchen, unsuc- 
cessfully, for food. 

He had no idea how much time 
had passed when the hiss of the 
jets changed key. 

The horizon dipped below the 
wingtip and straightened again, 
and he beheld land. He never saw 
the airfield, only water, then 
beach, then water again, then a 
few buildings. Then there was a 
roar of jets, with their clamshells 
deflecting their thrust forward to 
brake their speed, and then the 
wheels were on the ground. As the 
plane stopped he felt himself 



151 



once more possessed. It “was no 
longer terrifying — though Chand- 
ler was sure he was doomed. 

Without knowing where he was 
going or why he picked up the 
ripped book, opened the cabin 
exit and stepped down onto the 
rolling steps that had immediate- 
ly been brought into place. He 
was conscious of a horde of men 
swarming around the plane, 
stripping it of its cargo, and won- 
dered briefly at the rush; but he 
could not stop to watch them, his 
legs carried him swiftly across a 
paved strip to where a police car 
was cruising. 

Chandler cringed inside, in- 
stinctively, but his body did not 
falter as it stepped into the path 
of the car and raised its hand. 

The police car jammed on its 
brakes. The policeman at the 
wheel, Chandler thought inside 
himself, looked startled, but he 
also looked resigned. “To de 
South Gate, qvickly,” said 
Chandler’s lips, and he felt his 
legs carry him around to the door 
on the other side. 

There was another policeman 
on the seat next to the driver. He 
leaped like a hare to get the door 
open and get out before Chand- 
ler’s body got there. He made it 
with nothing to stare. “Jack, you 
go on, I’ll tell Headquarters,” he 
said hurriedly. The driver nodded 
without speaking. His lips were 
white. He reached over Chandler 



to close the door and made a 
sharp U-turn. 

As soon as the car was moving 
Chandler felt himself able to move 
his lips again. 

“I — ” he said. “I don’t know ” 

“Friend,” said the policeman, 
“kindly keep your mouth shut. 
‘South Gate,’ the exec said, and 
South Gate is where I’m going.” 

Chandler shrugged and looked 
out the window . just in time 
to see the jet that had brought 
him to the islands once more 
lumbering into life. It crept, wob- 
bling its wingtips, over the 
ground, picked up speed, roared 
across taxi strips and over rough 
ground and at last piled up 
against an ungainly looking for- 
eign airplane, a Russian jet by 
its markings, in a thunderous 
crash and ball of flame as its 
fuel exploded. No one got out. 

It seemed that traffic to Hawaii 
was all one way. 

VI 

r | ''HEY roared through down- 
town Honolulu with the 
siren blaring and cars scattering 
out of the way. At seventy miles 
an hour they raced down a road 
by the sea. Chandler caught a 
glimpse of a sign that said “Hilo,” 
but where or what “Hilo” might 
be he had no idea. Soon there 
were fewer cars; then there were 
none but their own. 



152 



GALAXY 



The road was a surburban high- 
way lined with housing develop- 
ments, shopping centers, palm 
groves and the occasional center 
of a small municipality, scatter- 
ing helterskelter together. There 
was a road like this extending in 
every direction from every city 
in the United States, Chandler 
thought; but this one was some- 
what altered. Something had been 
there before them. About a mile 
outside Honolulu’s outer fringe, 
life was cut off as with a knife. 
There were no people on foot, 
and the only cars were rusted 
wrecks lining the roads. The 
lawns were ragged stands of 
weeds in front of the ranch-type 
homes. 

It was evidently not allowed to 
live here. 

Chandler craned his neck. His 
curiosity was becoming almost 
unbearable. He opened his mouth, 
but, f T said, “Shut up.’ ” rumbled 
the cop without looking at him. 
There was a note in the police- 
man’s voice that impressed 
Chandler. He did not quite know 
what it was, but it made him 
obey. They drove for another 
fifteen minutes in silence, then 
drew up before a barricade across 
the road. 

Chandler got out. The police- 
man slammed the door behind 
him, ripping rubber off his tires 
with the speed of his U-turn and 
acceleration back toward Hono- 



lulu. He did not look at Chandler. 

Chandler stood staring off after 
him, in bright warm sunlight with 
a reek of hibiscus and rotting 
palms in his nostril. It was very 
quiet there, except for a soft 
scratchy sound of footsteps on 
gravel. As Chandler turned to 
face the man who was coming 
toward him, he realized he had 
learned one fact from the police- 
man after all. The cop was scared 
clear through. 

Chandler said, “Hello,” to the 
man who was approaching. 

He too wore a uniform, but not 
that of the Honolulu city police. 
It was like U.S. Army suntans, but 
without insignia. Behind him 
were half a dozen others in the 
same dress, smoking, chatting, 
leaning against whatever was 
handy. The barricades them- 
selves were impressively thor- 
ough. Barbed wire ran down the 
beach and out into the ocean; on 
the other side of the road, barbed 
wire ran clear out of sight along 
the middle of a side road. The gate 
itself was bracketed with ma- 
chine-gun emplacements. 

The guard waited until he was 
close to Chandler before speak- 
ing. “What do you want?” he 
asked without greeting. Chand- 
ler shrugged. “All right, just wait 
here,” said the guard, and began 
to walk away again. 

“Wait a minute! What am I 
waiting for?” The guard shook 



PLAGUE OF PYTHONS 



153 



his head without stopping or 
turning. He did not seem very in- 
terested, and he certainly was 
not helpful. 

Chandler put down the copy of 
The Prophet which he had car- 
ried so far and sat on the ground, 
but again he had no long time 
to wait. One of the guards came 
toward him, with the purposeful 
movements Chandler had learned 
to recognize. Without speaking 
the guard dug into a pocket. 
Chandler jumped up instinctive- 
ly, but it was only a set of car 
keys. 

As Chandler took them the 
look in the guard’s eyes showed 
the quick release of tension that 
meant he was free again; and 
in that same moment Chandler’s 
own body was occupied once 
more. 

He reached down and picked 
up the book. Quickly, but a little 
clumsily, his fingers selected a 
key, and his legs carried him 
toward a little French car parked 
just the other side of the barrier. 

/"'HANDLER was learning at 
^ last the skills of allowing his 
body to have its own way. He 
couldn’t help it in any event, so 
he was consciously disciplining 
himself to withdraw his atten- 
tion from his muscles and senses. 
It involved queerly vertiginous 
problems. A hundred times a 
minute there was some unex- 



pected body sway or movement 
of the hand, and his lagging, i m _ 
prisoned mind would wrench at 
its unresponsive nerves to put out 
the elbow that would brace him, 
or to catch itself with a step. He 
had learned to ignore these 
things. The mind that inhabited 
his body had ways not his own of 
maintaining balance and reach- 
ing an objective, but they were 
equally sure. 

He watched his own hands 
shifting the gears of the car. It 
was a make he had never driven, 
with a clutchless drive he did not 
understand, but the mind in his 
brain evidently understood it well 
enough. They picked up speed in 
great, gasoline-wasting surges. 

Chandler began to form a pic- 
ture of that mind. It belonged to 
an older man, from the hesitancy 
of its walk, and a testy one, from 
the heedless crash of the gears as 
it shifted. It drove with careless 
slapdash speed. Chandler’s mind 
yelled and flinched in his brain as 
they rounded blind curves, where 
any casual other motorist would 
have been a catastrophe; but the 
hand on the wheel and the foot 
on the accelerator did not hesi- 
tate. 

Beyond the South Gate the 
island of Oahu became abruptly 
wild. 

There were beautiful homes, 
but there were also great, gap- 
toothed spaces where homes had 




154 



GALAXY 



once been and were no longer. It 
seemed that some monstrous 
Zoning Commissar had stalked 
through the island with an eras- 
er, rubbing out the small homes, 
the cheap ones, the old ones; rub- 
bing out the stores, rubbing out 
the factories. This whole section 
of the island had been turned into 
an exclusive residential park. 

It was not uninhabited. Chand- 
ler thought he glimpsed a few 
people, though since the direction 
of his eyes was not his to control 
it was hard to be sure. And then 
the Renault turned into a lane, 
paved but narrow. Hardwood 
trees with some sort of blossoms, 
Chandler could not tell what, 
overhung it on both sides. 

■ It meandered for a mile or so, 
turned and opened into a great 
vacant parking lot. The Renault 
stopped with a squeal of brakes 
in front of a door that was 
flanked by bronze plaques: TWA 
Flight Message Center. 

Chandler caught sight of a 
skeletal towering form overhead, 
like a radio transmitter antenna, 
as his body marched him inside, 
up a motionless escalator, along 
a hall and into a room. 

His muscles relaxed. 

He glanced around and, from 
a huge couch beside a desk, a 
huge soft body stirred and, gasp- 
ing, sat up. It was a very fat old 
man, almost bald, wearing a cor- 
onet of silvery spikes. 



He looked at Chandler without 
much interest. “Vot’s your name?” 
he wheezed. He had a heavy, in- 
eradicable accent, like a Hapsburg 
or a Russian diplomat. Chandler 
recognized it readily. He had 
heard it often enough, from his 
own lips. 

'T'HE man’s name was Koitska, 
■*- he said in his accented 
wheeze. If he had another name 
he did not waste it on Chandler. 
He took as few words as possible 
to order Chandler to be seated 
and to be still. 

Koitska squinted at the copy 
of Gibran’s The Prophet. He did 
not glance at Chandler, but 
Chandler felt himself propelled 
out of his seat, to hand the book 
to Koitska, then returning. Koit- 
ska turned its remaining pages 
with an expression of bored re- 
pugnance, like a man picking off 
his arm. He seemed to be waiting 
for something. 

A door closed on the floor be- 
low, and in a moment a girl came 
into the room. 

She was tall, dark and not 
quite young. Chandler, struck by 
her beauty, was sure that he had 
seen her, somewhere, but could 
not place her face. She wore a 
coronet like the fat man’s, inter- 
twined in a complicated hairdo, 
and she got right down to busi- 
ness. “Chandler, is it? All right, 
love, what we want to know is 



PLAGUE OF PYTHONS 



155 



what this is all about.” She in- 
dicated the book. 

A relief that was like pain 
crossed Chandler’s mind. So that 
was why he was here! Whoever 
these people were, however they 
managed to rule men’s minds, 
they were not quite certain of 
their perfect power. To them the 
sad, futile Orphalese represented 
a sort of annoyance — not im- 
portant enough to be a threat — 
but something which had proved 
inconvenient at one time and 
therefore needed investigating. 
As Chandler was the only survi- 
vor they had deemed it worth 
their godlike whiles to transport 
him four thousand miles so that 
he might satisfy their curiosity. 

Chandler did not hesitate in 
telling them all about the people 
of Orphalese. There was nothing 
worth concealing, he was quite 
sure. No debts are owed to the 
dead; and the Orphalese had 
proved on their own heads, at the 
last, that their ritual of pain was 
only an annoyance to the pos- 
sessors, not a tactic that could 
long be used against them. 

It took hardly five minutes to 
say everything that needed say- 
ing about Guy, Meggie and the 
other doomed and suffering in- 
habitants of the old house on the 
mountain. 

Koitska hardly spoke. The girl 
was his interrogator, and some- 
times translator as well, when his 



English was not sufficient to com- 
prehend a point. With patient 
detachment she kept the story 
moving until Koitska with a bored 
shrug indicated he was through. 

Then she smiled at Chandler 
and said, “Thanks, love. Haven’t 
I seen you somewhere before?” 
“I don’t know. I thought the 
same thing about you.” 

“Oh, everybody’s seen me. Lots 
of me. But — well, no matter. 
Good luck, love. Be nice to Koit- 
ska and perhaps he’ll do as much 
for you.” And she was gone. 

Koitska lay unmoving on his 
couch for a few moments, rub- 
bing a fat nose with a plump 
finger. “Hah,” he said at last. 
Then, abruptly, “And now, de 
qvestion is, vot to do vit you, eh? 
I do not t’ink you can cook, eh?” 

VW/'ITH unexpected clarity 
** Chandler realized he was 
on trial for his life. “Cook? No, 
I’m afraid not. I mean, I can boil 
eggs,” he said. “Nothing fancy.” 
“Hah,” grumbled Koitska. “Vel. 
Ve need a couple, three doctors, 
but I do not t’ink you vould do.” 
Chandler shook his head. “I’m 
an electrical engineer,” he said. 
“Or was.” 

* “Vas?” 

“I haven’t had much practice. 
There has not been a great deal 
of call for engineers, the last year 
or two.” 

“Hah.” Koitska seemed to con- 



156 



GALAXY 



sider. “Vel,” he said, “it could be 
. yes, it could be dat ve have 
a job for you. You go back down- 
stairs and — no, vait.” The fat 
man closed his eyes and Chand- 
ler felt himself seized and pro- 
pelled down the stairs to what 
had once been a bay of a built-in 
garage. Now it was fitted up with 
workbenches and the gear of a 
radio ham’s dreams. 

Chandler walked woodenly to 
one of the benches. His own 
voice spoke to him. “Ve got here 
someplace — da, here is cirguit 
diagrams and de specs for a 
sqvare-vave generator. You know 
vot dat is? Write down de an- 
swer.” Chandler, released with a 
pencil in his hand and a pad be- 
fore him, wrote Yes. “Okay. Den 
you build vun for me. I areddy 
got vun but I vant another. You 
do dis in de city, not here. Go 
to ' Tripler, dey tells you dere 
vere you can work, vere to get 
parts, all dat. Couple days you 
come out here again, I see if I 
like how you build.” 

Clutching the thick sheaf of 
diagrams, Chandler felt himself 
propelled outside and back into 
the little car. The interview was 
over. 

He wondered if he would be 
able to find his way back to 
Honolulu, but that problem was 
then postponed as he discovered 
he could not start the car. His 
own hands had already done so, 



of course, but it had been so 
quick and sure that he had not 
paid attention; now he found that 
the ignition key was marked only 
in French, which he could not 
speak. After trial and error he 
discovered the combination that 
would start the engine and un- 
lock the steering wheel, and then 
gingerly he toured the perimeter 
of the lot until he found an exit 
road. 

It was close to midnight, he 
judged. Stars were shining over- 
head; there was a rising moon. He 
then remembered, somewhat 
tardily, that he should not be 
seeing stars. The lane he had 
come in on had been overhung 
on both sides with trees. 

A few minutes later he real- 
ized he was quite lost. 

Chandler stopped the car, 
swore feelingly, got out and 
looked around. 

There was nothing much to 
see. The roads bore no markers 
that made sense to him. He 
shrugged and rummaged through 
the glove compartment on the 
chance of a map; there was none, 
but he did find what he had al- 
most forgotten, a half-empty pack 
of cigarettes. It had been — he 
counted — nearly a week since 
he had smoked. He lit up. 

TT was a pleasant evening, too. 

He felt almost relaxed. 

He stood there, wondering just 



PLAGUE OF PYTHONS 



157 



what might be about to happen 
next — with curiosity more than 
fear — and then he felt a light 
touch at his mind. 

It was nothing, really. Or noth- 
ing that he could quite identify. 
It was though he had been nudg- 
ed. It seemed that someone was 
about to usurp his body again, 
but that did not develop. 

As he had about decided to 
forget it and get back in the car 
he saw headlights approaching. 

A low, lean sports car slowed 
as it came near, stopping beside 
him, and a girl leaned out, almost 
invisible in the darkness. “There 
you are, love,” she said cheer- 
fully. “Thought I spotted some- 
one. Lost?” 

She had a coronet, and Chand- 
ler recognized her. It was the 
girl who had interrogated him. 
“I guess I am,” he admitted. 

The girl leaned forward. 
“Come in, dear. Oh, that thing? 
Leave it here, the silly little bug.” 
She giggled as they drove away 
from the Renault. “Koitska 
wouldn’t like you wandering a- 
round. I guess he decided to give 
you a job?” 

“How did you know?” 

She said softly, “Well, love, 
you’re here, you know. Other- 
wise — never mind. What are 
you supposed to be doing?” 
“Going to Tripler, whatever 
that is. In Honolulu, I guess. 

TO BE CC 



Then I have to build some radio 
equipment.” 

“Tripler’s actually on the other 
side of the city. I’ll take you to 
the gate; then you tell them 
where you want to go. They’ll 
take care of it.” 

“I don’t have any money for 
fare.” 

She laughed. After a moment 
she said, “Koitska’s not the worst. 
But I’d mind my step if I were 
you, love. Do what he says, the 
best you can. You never know. 
You might find yourself very 
fortunate . 

“I already think that. I’m a- 
live.” 

“Why, love, that point of view 
will take you far.” The sports 
car slid smoothly to a stop at the 
barricade and, in the floodlights 
above the machine-gun nests, 
she looked more closely at Chan- 
dler. “What’s that on your fore- 
head, dear?” 

Somehow the woolen cap had 
been lost. “A brand,” he said 
shortly. “ ‘H’ for ‘hoaxer.’ I did 
something when one of you 
people had me, and they thought 
I’d done it on my own.” 

“Why — why, this is wonder- 
ful!” the girl said excitedly. “No 
wonder I thought I’d seen you 
before. Don’t you remember? 

I was in the forewoman at your 
trial!”

TJOBERT leaned on one of the 
clouds and said, reproach- 
fully, “You’re far too aggressive, 
dear.” 

“I know,” Roberta answered in 
a small voice. 

“It shows in everything you do,” 
Robert continued. “Your voice, 
the way you walk, everything. 
You’d better watch out for it. It 
will get you in trouble some day 
. besides spoiling the illusion.” 
Roberta drew breath in a little 
gasp. Robert smiled. “What’s the 
matter, anyhow?” he asked. “Are 
you still envious of other women, 
Roberta? You oughtn’t to be. 
Now that we’re, well, married. 
And everything.” 

“Are we really married?” Ro- 



berta wanted to know. “It seems 
to me . sometimes ... that I

“Hush. Be quiet.” Robert 
seemed about to chin himself on a 
cloud and then thought better of 
it. “Of course you’re happy.” 

He leaned his elbows on the 
pinkest of the cloud bands and 
smiled at Roberta benevolently. 
He looked, Roberta thought, like

bered out of the tub, picked up a 
towel with one hand, and with 
the other pressed a switch. The 
face of the receptionist on duty at 
the desk in the lobby became vis- 
ible. 

“A Mr. Rodvorello Dlag to see 
you, Miss Prentice,” said the re- 
ceptionist. “R-o-d-v-o-r-e-l-l-o 
D-l-a-g. He says he knows you. 
Shall I send him up?” 

Roberta’s eyebrows arched 
doubtfully. “Rov — ? Rob — ?” But 
a glance at the ceiling showed that 
Robert had gone. He might have 
gone into one of the closets, which 
was a good place for a skeleton to 
hide itself. More likely he had 
pulled a cloud in after him. Cuc- 
koo Robert. Like a cuckoo in a 
clock. 

“Oh, have him come on up,” 
Roberta told the image of the 
receptionist’s face. “In about 
twenty minutes. Even if I don’t 
remember him.” 

TJOBERT and Roberta were 
waltzing around and around, 
with Roberta’s long pink tulle 
skirt whirling out behind, when 
Mr. Dlag knocked. 

Robert went away. Roberta 
went to the door. 

Mr. Dlag was an extraordinary 
looking man. Roberta, peering at 
him, tried to remember where 
people who looked like that came 
from. He was wearing a button- 
hole flower made of brown feath- 



ers, extremely large synthetic opal 
cufflinks, and a suit of unusually 
garish iridi-tweed. His manners, 
though, were excellent. 

“And how are you now, ah, Miss 
Prentice?” he asked yhen they 
were both seated. “Quite recov- 
ered from your operation? Well 
and happy, I trust?” 

“Yes, I’m feeling well,” Roberta 
admitted. 

“Good! I’m glad to hear it,” Mr. 
Dlag declared. His eyes, coal- 
black against the deep whiteness 
of his skin, twinkled. “It wasn’t 
any' trouble for me. Just a ques- 
tion of exerting a little influence 
in the right quarters. And if it 
made you happy — well! Any time 
I’m too busy to help out a friend, 
I’ll leave Earth.” 

“Awfully good of you,” mur- 
mured Roberta, who hadn’t the 
foggiest idea what he was talking 
about. 

Mr. Dlag nodded. “I came to 
bring you your ticket,” he said. 
“You remember our little agree- 
ment, of course. Here it is.” He 
extended an envelope. 

Roberta opened it. Inside there 
was a very long ticket for Vega. 
One way, on the S.S. Thor, Am- 
sonia Star Lines. 

Vega. So that was where Mr. 
Dlag was from. Vega. Why hadn’t 
Roberta realized it before? And 
was he, like other Vegans, a pas- 
sionate collector? Was his collec- 
tion what he went on living for?

“How’s your collection, Mr. 
Dlag?” Roberta asked brightly. 

Mr. Dlag frowned. “Dear Miss 
Prentice,” he said, “I thought you 
understood. You won’t be sub- 
ject to annoyance in any way. 
You’re to stay on Needr — that’s 
the Vegan planet — only a couple 
of months. You will be a part of 
my collection, of course. But you 
won’t be aware of it.” 

“You must have a very unusual 
collection, Mr. Dlag,” Roberta 
said. 

Mr. Dlag seemed to expand 
with pleasure. “I flatter myself, it 
is an unusual idea,” he cried. 
“Other Vegans collect postage 
stamps, or coins, or obsolete radio 
sets. I collect imitation things. 

“That was what interested me 
most, you know, when I came to 
Earth — realizing how many Earth 
things were imitations. Insects 
that imitate other insects. Plants 
that imitate other plants. Animals 
that imitate plants. Plants that 
imitate rocks. And half your arti- 
facts imitate other things. It’s 
amazing. There are almost no 
imitation things on Needr, my 
home.” 

R OBERTA had folded up the 
ticket and was putting it 
away in a handbag. At the bottom 
of the handbag there was a little 
gun. It had been Robert’s birth- 
day gift. (How had he got it? Sli- 
ver guns were strictly illegal. But 

ROBERTA 



Robert could do all sorts of 
things.) 

“That’s very interesting,” 
Roberta murmured. “I’m not quite 
clear, though, Mr. Rov — Rob — 
Mr. Dlag, how I fit into your col- 
lection.” 

Once more Mr. Dlag frowned. 
“I thought you understood. Well 
— ” he smiled deprecatingly — 
“you see, Miss Prentice, you’re by 
way of being an imitation your- 
self.” 

“An imitation?” Roberta 
echoed. It was odd, at that word, 
how much Mr. Dlag had begun 
to resemble Robert. Robert, who 
usually sat in the sky on a pink 
cloud. 

“Yes. Because of your opera- 
tion, you know. You’re an imita- 
tion woman now, Miss Prentice. 
That’s why I helped you with 
getting it.” 

Roberta pulled the sliver gun 
out of the handbag and shot Ve- 
gan-Robert in the forehead with 
it. 

Since the forehead is in close 
proximity to the brain, Robert 
died almost immediately. Rober- 
ta’s mouth could not help coming 
open. 

Oh, dear. 

Oh, dear indeed. For killing 
Robert was about as naughty a 
thing as it was possible to do. 
Naughty, naughty. Naughty. Left 
Roberta hand slapped right 
Roberta hand — the one with the 



161 



sliver gun — hard and repeatedly. 
Naughty hand. It deserved to be 
hurt. 

But now what was to be done? 
The big mahogany chest in the 
bedroom was empty, except for 
the plasti-mink coat Roberta had 
ben planning to wear when the 
weather got cold. Roberta took 
the coat out and hung it on a 
hanger in the closet. Then, catch- 
ing Vegan-Robert by the back of 
the jacket collar and the seat of 
his synthi-tweed pants, Roberta 
tugged him over to the chest and 
tumbled him in. The lid closed 
down on him with a neat bang. 

There. 

Having killed Robert was very 
naughty, certainly. But now that 
he was dead — well, it was rather 
nice to have him gone perma- 
nently. 

Something seemed to have hap- 
pened to time. It alternately 
caught and then went forward in 
big jerks, like a tape that sticks 
in the machine. Roberta put on 
makeup; it took hours, though it 
was only five minutes by the 
clock. Then it was after eleven, 
with nothing happening in be- 
tween at all, and time for the in- 
jection. And bed. 

TJOBERTA sterilized the syr- 
inge in alcohol; it was easier 
than boiling it in water. The 
needle went into the tip of the 
sterile ampoule and sucked up 



fluid. Cotton scoured a spot on 
one plump thigh. 

“Theelin,” Robert said from a 
purplish cloud bank. “An extract 
of the female hormones. Your reg- 
ular glandular therapy, designed 
to make you a little more . what 
you’re trying to be.” 

Roberta’s heart gave a terrific 
bound. “Go away. Go away. 
You’re in the chest. You can’t be 
here. You’re dead.” 

“There’s somebody in the chest, 
certainly,” Robert said with a 
judicial air. “Who it is is another 
matter. I rather doubt it’s me. 

“You may be able to get away 
with it. Lewd Vegan, corruptor 
of innocent terrestrial youth, slain 
by heartbroken victim — that 
sort of thing. ’M, yes. But for 
God’s sake, Roberta, don’t kill 
anybody else. Mind, now.” He dis- 
appeared. 

Time gave another jerk and it 
was morning. Roberta couldn’t be 
said not to have slept, since there 
had been no time to sleep in. But 
what had been on the agenda at 
midnight was still there now that 
it was morning — how to make 
Robert go away and stay away. 

Well. If there weren’t any 
Robert, there wouldn’t be any 
Roberta. Would there, now? 

Sleeping pills? There weren’t 
nearly enough of them. There 
wasn’t any gas in the kitchenette. 
The bridges were a long way off 
to jump from. And a hanging 



162 



GALAXY 




weight would break down the 
chandelier. But in the drawer in 
the kitchen there was a knife. 

Roberta drew the paring knife 
lightly over one wrist. It hurt. It 
would hurt an awful lot, really. 
But it might hurt . somebody 
else worse. 

Roberta was making a second 
attempt when the buzzer on the 
vizi-screen rang. The noise was 
startlingly loud and harsh. 
Roberta jumped so hard that the 
paring knife shot out of the in- 
flicting hand, into the sink and 
down into the garbage reduction 
unit, which happened — but how 
odd! — which somehow happened 
to be turned on. 

The knife was chewed up al- 
most immediately. The buzzer 
went on ringing. 

XT was the clerk at the desk in 

the lobby again, and she had 
another caller for Miss Prentice. 

Clement Thomas was a small, 
slight man, quite ordinary except 
for his eyes, which were green, 
bright and interesting. He said he 
wanted to see Miss Prentice for a 
few moments about a personal 
matter. 

They talked about the weather 
for a while, and then Mr. Thomas 
(like what’s-his-name yesterday) 
said he hoped Miss Prentice was 
feeling well and happy. 

“Yes,” said Roberta. 

“That’s good news,” said Mr. 



Thomas. He cleared his throat. 
“You know, Miss Ptentice, there’s 

been a recession — - depression 

whatever they’re calling it now. 
Times have been rather bad for 
me professionally.” 

“Bad for other people too,” said 
Roberta, thinking of Mr. Dlag in 
the chest. 

“Yes, I suppose.” Once more 
Mr. Thomas cleared his throat. 
“And of course I’ve been some- 
what distressed by thinking about 
our professional, hum, association. 
As you know, the operation I p3r- 
formed on you was strictly illegal, 
though it was performed at your 
urgent request. If I were to go to 
the authorities, I could clear my 
conscience . and no doubt get 
off with a light sentence. But that 
would mean trouble for you.” Mr. 
Thomas cocked his head and sim- 



I 






pered engagingly. 

Oper — ? “There’s nothing so 
terrible about an abortion,” 
Roberta answered. 

“Abortions?” Mr. Thomas 
seemed startled. His simper dis- 
appeared. It looked, Roberta 
thought, as if the mask he had on 
over his face was getting thin. He 
laughed. “An abortion, my dear, 
is something you’ll never need. 
Never in this world.” 

He started to laugh again, and 
checked himself. “Don’t you re- 
member?” he said to Roberta, who 
was fidgeting with the clasp of the 
handbag and wondering who Mr. 



[ 



Thomas really was, under his 
mask. “Honestly, don’t you re- 
member? You came to me six 
months or so ago, recommended 
by a certain, hum, alien, and 
asked for my professional services. 
Your name was Robert Bayliss 
then. You had me perform a sex- 
reversal op — ” 

This time there was no possible 
doubt. He wasn’t Clement Thom- 
as, he was Robert. The person sit- 
ting opposite surgeon-Robert shot 
him in the throat. 

Since the throat is further from 
the brain than the forehead is, it 
took Robert No. 2 quite a lot 
longer to die than it had taken 
Mr. Dlag, yesterday. Sliver-gun 
darts act directly on the nervous 
system. Robert tied himself up 
in convulsion after convulsion, 
horrid masculine knots, before he 
relaxed finally. But there. He was 
dead. 

Roberta put Robert in the 
chest beside yesterday’s Robert. 
It was a tight fit. There was trou- 
ble with the lid. 

The bodies were still being 
wrestled with when, on a bank of 
black clouds very low down on 
the ceiling, Robert appeared. He 
looked angry. “I told you not to,” 
he said. 

Roberta, trying yet again to 
make Mr. Dlag’s left arm bend 
backwards, made no reply. Rob- 
ert, chewing on his lower lip, as- 
cended slowly to the zenith of 



the ceiling. “Don’t waste time with 
that,” he said at last. “You can’t 
possibly get away with it. Get 
your suitcases, Roberta, and start 
packing. Hurry up.” 

“But, Robert — ” 

“Yes?” 

“Why do I have to go away? I 
like this place.” 

“What are you using for a 
brain? If we want to go on living 
even a little longer, we’re going to 
have to run. And run.” 

He disappeared, drawing the 
black cloud in after him. Roberta 
remained staring up at the ceil- 
ing, head thrown back, Adam’s 
apple prominent. 

YV7HAT was the use of hoping 
any longer? No matter where 
they went — Venus, Vega, Arctur- 
us, even M 31 — it would be the 
same. Robert would go along with 
Roberta. 

Roberta’s jaw set. No, that 
wasn’t quite true. After Mr. Dlag 
had died, Robert had been dead 
for a little while. It might be a 
matter of keeping on trying. 

If you killed people enough, 
you would — it was reasonable, 
wasn’t it? — you would get 
through all the masks they wore 
to the person behind them. At last. 
To the one you had always tried 
to destroy. To him. 

“I’ll kill you yet, Robert,” 
Roberta said between his teeth.

Bimmie says people are stupid. Bimmie 
says he can help them — but they're not 
really worth his trouble , Bimmie says! 




By SYDNEY VAN SCYOC 




June 27, 1982 Bimmie said to do 
this, keep a diary. I said, Cows? 
He said, You deaf, woman? A 
book! Then I remembered, only I 
haven’t seen one. It’s for when he’s 
famous. Then we can have it pub- 
lished anytime we need money. 

I’d better tell about us. I’m 
short, sort of cute, and I cook 
good. Bimmie’s tall and skinny, 
he likes to eat. He’s 18, I’m 16. 
We got married 22 days ago. In- 
stead of a fancy wedding, Bimmie 
told my folks, Give us money. 

He needed the money for his 
laboratory. It’s in the basement. 
It’s what’ll make him famous. 



June 31, 1982 We got a cat and 
dog. They’re black and two 
months old. I wanted red collars. 
Bimmie said, Don’t waste my 
money, woman. 

,, Bimmie wanted them down in 
his laboratory. He said that’d be 
. proper conditions. I said, No, I’ll 
leave if you do and you’ll have to 
' eat capsules. 

The cat’s he, the dog’s she. 

Bimmie doesn’t want them out- 

-JR : 

■ side, ever. 

July 3, 1982 We thought Bim- 
mie’s folks’d change their minds. 
But they said, Finally and con- 
clusively, we won’t. Bimmie says 
he doesn’t want to go to college if 
they’re stingy because we got 
married. He already knows every- 
thing important. 

■ ’

BIMMIE SAYS 




He wants me to finish school. I 
can finish in December. I thought 
when you got married you didn’t 
have to, just slept late and fixed 
your hair. 

July 9, 1982 The puppy’s Susta, 
the cat’s Sup. Susta’s jealous be- 
cause Sup jumps on the couch, 
and she can’t. 

Bimmie’ll have to make pills 
for Susta. She hides from his 
needle. She’ll be small. That’s 
good, Bimmie says. 

August 17, 1982 He just married 
me to cook! Every night he’s in 
his laboratory. I’m always in this 
stupid, ugly house. 

August 18, 1982 Susta won’t 
change for a long time. Bimmie 
has pills now. 



September 1, 1982 School started. 
Frankie’s still stuck on me. He 
says I’m sexy, that’s why Bimmie 
married me. I said, He married 
me for my cooking. He laughed. 



September 11, 1982 I felt funny 
again. I stopped by Momma’s. 
She bets she knows what it is. 
She knew after ten days. 



September 15, 1982 I had to ask 
the school nurse if it was that. She 
said, Yes, two weeks. I hope she’s 
wrong. Babies are work. She said, 
But the fulfillment. I said, Chang- 



'Sygsgi 

: < ‘‘ : ■ 







ing soppy diapers is what you 
call fulfillment? 

It doesn’t show. Frankie winked 
at me. 

September 17, 1982 The cat 
climbed those lace curtains Bim- 
mie’s mother gave us. Bimmie 
said it was my job to watch him. I 
said, That’s a stupid way to spend 
my life. He said, I didn’t marry 
you to have you sit around and 
do nothing. 

Susta watched Sup and whined. 
She wants to be a cat. 

September 27, 1982 Bimmie read 
my diary. He said there wasn’t a 
June 31. He says to tell more 
about his work. It won’t make 
money if he’s not in it. 

I told him about the baby. He 
said, Whoopee! He got some ob- 
stetrics books. 

October 5, 1982 Bimmie expects 
the baby to kick already. I’m glad 
it doesn’t! He made the puppy’s 
pills tonight. 

October 7, 1982 I let them out- 
side. The smell in the house turns 
my stomach. I’m afraid to take the 
pills Bimmie made me. 

October 9, 1982 I let them out 
again. There’s a black dog next 
door with a long nose, ears like 
rosebuds and white feet. Susta 
was scared. Sup hissed. 



October 25, 1982 Bimmie’s so 
nice. He took me to a tridiversion. 
He hates them. He said, They’re 
for the cloddy-minded masses. I 
said, Well, what are we? 

I want a tridiversion wall. Bim- 
mie says, No. We had a fight. 

October 30, 1982 I took a pill 
Bimmie made. I felt good. 

I let them out. It beats cleaning 
up. Susta played with that dog. 

November 7, 1982 I went to Dr. 
Brantly. He hypnotized me. I 
don’t remember it. * 

December 13, 1982 Susta’s leav- 
ing spots. I thought, She’s hurt. 
Bimmie explained and said, Don’t 
let her out. He wants to wait till 
next time to have puppies. He 
said, The treatment must take full 
effect first. He explained but I 
didn’t understand. 

January 5, 1983 I’m out of school. 
It’s boring. Momma says I’m too 
young to settle down. She’s crazy. 
I’m sixteen. 

January 11, 1983 Bimmie’s read- 
ing more obstetrics books. Hypno- 
tism too. He tried to hypnotize 
me, but I went to sleep. 

January 14, 1983 I wish Momma 
would stop. She said, Where’re 
you going to put a baby, with only 
one bedroom. She cried and called 



168 



GALAXY 



me Baby. Gosh! She said, You 
shouldn’t have cats around babies, 
you’ll have to give him away. 

Bimmie heard, from the bed- 
room. He came out. He said, I am 
conducting an important scientific 
experiment with the cat and dog. 
I would as soon give away the 
baby. Momma got white under 
her plasti-skin. She said, Bimmie, 
you’re a monster for experiment- 
ing on dumb animals. And for re- 
jecting your own child. 

Then Sup climbed the curtains 
Momma gave us. She shrieked, 
You’re ungrateful! and huffed 
out. 

She came back later, asking us 
to forgive her. She said she 
wanted to help, since we’re both 
still children. Well! 

I do wonder where we’ll put the 
baby. Maybe on the couch. 

February 17, 1983 I had to tell 
Bimmie I was letting them out. 
Sup fought with the dog next 
door. Bimmie got mad. He told 
me, They must have a controlled 
environment. I said, It’s hard for 
me to bend over to clean up. 
Finally he said he’d clean up and 
wasn’t it funny Sup and that dog 
knew they were rivals. 

I didn’t know myself. 

March 17, 1983 I saw Dr. Brantly 
today. He says I’m fine. I tried to 
remember him putting me in the 
trance, but I couldn’t. 



April 19, 1983 Saw Dr. Brantly. 
Sup pulled the curtains down. 
Susta isn’t jealous any more, she’s 
playing with a string. 

May 9, 1983 I’m writing this next 
day. Last night I had this sharp 
pain. I said, Bimmie, call Dr. 
Brantly. I remember him looking 
at me funny. That’s all I remem- 
ber until I woke up in the hospi- 
tal. Bimmie was sitting beside me, 
looking proud. I asked him, 
What’s happened? He grinned. 
We have a nine-pound son, he 
said. I named him after the man 
who delivered him. I said, Did I 
faint? That wasn’t the way it was 
explained, just that Dr. Brantly 
would put me in a trance. Bimmie 
was too busy grinning to say, then 
he had to go to work. The doctor 
came in. I said, It wasn’t bad, I 
only felt one pain. He frowned. I 
said, Can I see the baby? He said, 
Later. He went out too. 

I thought I must have cussed. 

I didn’t understand until the 
nurse brought the baby. He had a 
little plastic bracelet that said 
Bimford Fost, Jr. He was red and 
squalling. I felt like doing the 
same, because I knew why Bim- 
mie had been studying those ob- 
stetrics books. He has to try 
everything! 

May 21, 1983 I’m seventeen to- 
day. Bimmie says to write more. 
He thinks that’s all I have to do. 



BIMMI E SAYS 



169 



The baby sleeps all the time he 
isn’t crying. I like him, only I’m 
tired of diapers. 

Susta gets three pills every day. 
She plays with them, then eats 
them. Bimmie said last night, It 
won’t be long until my experiment 
bears fruit. He said to write that 
here. 

June 3, 1983 Susta tried to climb 
the curtains. 

June 5, 1983 Bimmie wanted to 
give the baby some pills he made. 
I said, No. He said, They’ll make 
him smarter, woman. I said, He’s 
enough trouble dumb. 

Today was our first anniver- 
sary. Bimmie wouldn’t buy me 
anything. 

June 9, 1983 We fought about a 
dryer. After he left I said, For 
that I’ll let your animals out. The 
dog next door came up. Susta 
arched her back. 

June 21, 1983 I’ve been putting 
them out every day. 

June 25, 1983 Bimmie says to 
write every day, his experiment is 
coming to a head. I can’t see any- 
thing happening. Susta gets six 
pills now. 

June 27, 1983 The dog’s that way 
again. Bimmie said, At last my 
experiment shall be carried to 



completion. Not that I care for 
fame and riches, no, I care only 
for the accomplishment of some- 
thing man has never before 
achieved. I said he didn’t sound 
natural. He said, Put it down that 
way, woman. 

June 29, 1983 Bimmie wanted to 
feed the baby. I caught him be- 
fore he gave him a pill. We 
fought. He said, Who delivered 
him? I said, I made him, and 
pointed to my stomach. I said, I 
won’t have you using him like a 
guinea pig. 

July 4, 1983 Bimmie says tomor- 
row we’ll shut them up in the 
basement. 

July 5, 1983 The funniest thing. 
Bimmie said, You put them in the 
basement. Then he left. I thought, 
I’ll just take them out while I 
hang diapers. But when we went 
out, three dogs came up. I said, 
Scat! I couldn’t chase them be- 
cause I had my arms full of dia- 
pers, because Bimmie won’t buy 
me a basket. They came closer, 
edging around. I stomped my feet 
and yelled. The dog next door 
came and growled. Then Sup 
hissed at him. This was the 
first the other three saw Sup. He 
hunched up, spitting and intend- 
ing to chase them off. Only they 
took out after him instead. He 
ran off with four dogs after him.

I couldn’t do anything, my arms 
were full. 

July 6, 1983 Bimmie didn’t think 
it was funny. He yelled, What are 
you, stupid? Didn’t you know 
dogs would come around? Didn’t 
you know dogs chase cats? He 
took the car and called, Kitty, 
kitty, all over town. No luck. I 
said, Get another cat. He said, 
This one is used to Susta. I said, 
There’ll be another time. He 
stared at me and said Susta’s sys- 
tem would tolerate only so much 
of the stuff he’s been giving her. 
He can’t give her any more after 
next month. He’ll have to wait 
another year. Then he went look- 
ing again. 

That was last night. Maybe 
he’ll come home tonight. 

July 7, 1983 He hasn’t. Bimmie’s 
biting his fingernails. He’d bite 
harder if he knew what happened 
today. 

I thought Susta was asleep 
when I went to hang diapers. I 
had my arms clear full. When I 
opened the door, Susta shot past 
me. I yelled at her, but she went 
flying down the street, and I saw 
that dog next door take off behind 
her. I thought first thing, It’s Bim- 
mie’s fault for not buying a dryer. 

I hung the clothes fast. After 
all, nothing could happen in such 
a short time. Then I started up 
the street calling, Here Susta! But 



the baby was alone, I had to hurry 
home. 

She came back in half an hour. 
I didn’t tell Bimmie yet. 

July 8, 1983 I didn’t tell him, still. 
He was mad because he had to 
pay to get Sup out of the pound. 
Bimmie salved his ears, they were 
tom, and put them in the base- 
ment. He said, Now! 

July 15, 1983 Bimmie says to 
write every day. It’s dull, them in 
the basement. They come up to- 
morrow. 

July 23, 1983 Susta acts funnier 
than ever. She rubs my legs when 
I’m cooking. She keeps wetting 
her paws and rubbing her face. 

August 3, 1983 Today I caught 
Susta sharpening her claws on the 
couch. I said, Bimmie, look at the 
crazy dog, thinks she’s a cat. He 
frowned. He only has one pimple 
now, he’s kind of handsome. I 
said, Isn’t it cute? Bimmie went 
downstairs. I think he was wor- 
ried. 

August 11, 1983 Susta’s getting 
big. I let her sleep with the baby. 
Bimmie says, Whoopee! It 
worked! I’m scared to tell him 
now. 

August 12, 1983 Susta rubs my 
leg when she’s hungry. Then she 



BIMMIE SAYS 



171 



sits and switches her tail for a 
long time. 

August 17, 1983 Susta meowed 
today. I was fixing dinner. She 
looked up and said, Meow. It 
wasn’t supposed to be this way. 
Bimmie’s afraid she’ll have kit- 
tens. That isn’t what he’s trying 
to do. 

September 5, 1983 Susta wanted 
to go down in the basement this 
afternoon. When I called her for 
supper she came up with her 
stomach flat. Bimmie and I went 
down. Susta ducked back in a hole 
in the wall. There’s a sort of little 
cave. We said, They must be in 
there. We got a flash, and we 
could see little black balls. Bim- 
mie couldn’t reach them. 

Bimmie kept talking about 
how his experiment is going to 
revolutionize agriculture. 

September 6, 1983 I can hear her 
meowing to them. We can see 
them with the flash. We can’t tell 
anything yet. 

September 7, 1983 He’ll buy a 
typewriter but not a dryer! He’s 
going to write a book about his 
experiment. He expects me to 
type it. 

September 10, 1983 She still 
won’t bring them out. She purred 
today, rusty-like. Bimmie says, 



sometimes, It had to work. Other 
times he bites his nails. 

He gave me ten pages to type. 
I thought I’d better. 

September 13, 1983 I went down 
to call Susta and I saw them. 
There were five, wobbling every- 
where. They’re the cutest fat 
things. I picked one up, and then 
I felt sick. He had a long nose and 
little rosebud ears and white feet. 
He looked like the dog next door. 

All of them do. They’re all 
puppies. Nothing else, just pup- 
pies. 

I put them in a box and took 
them upstairs. 

Bimmie’s working tonight. I’ll 
go to bed before he comes’ home. 

September 14, 1983 He raved all 
morning and tromped around. I 
said, Shut up or I’ll leave and 
you’ll have to eat capsules. He 
said, I could eat dog food! Then 
he wanted to see my diary. I said, 
No. But he yanked out all the 
drawers and found it. 

I took the baby and went to 
Momma’s. 

It was suppertime when I came 
home. He was on the couch with 
Sup and Susta and the puppies. 

He didn’t act mad, just nasty- 
nice. So you came home, he said. 
I never realized how limited you 
were, Listie. Your diary’s shown 
me a lot. Can you at least find 
homes for the puppies?

I said, I guess. I put the baby 
down. He hadn’t thrown anything 
or burned my diary. 

He said, Good, then. I’ve fixed 
supper. 

He had hamburger, frozen pie 
and hot chocolate. Some of it 
tasted bad. I didn’t say anything. 

September 15, 1983 I asked Bim- 
mie, Should I quit my diary? He 
said, Yes. Then, No, keep on. I 
asked, was he doing another ex- 
periment? He said, Not yet. I 
said, Bim better not start talking 
early. He said, You don’t think I’d 
experiment with my own child? I 
didn’t know. He said, Bim might 
be smart anyway. I said, He might 
be, he’s your son. It was a good 
compliment. 

September 17, 1983 Bimmie 

wants to learn cooking. He said, 
You have to work hard, hanging 
diapers. It will help if I can cook. 

I’ll teach him hot chocolate 
first. His fixing tastes awful. 

October 5, 1983 I have little to 
report. Bimford, Jr. is flourishing. 
The puppies are adorable. Susta 
and Sup tend them jointly. 

Bimmie has no new project. He 
has thrown all his energies into 
cooking. He does quite well, ex- 
cept for hot chocolate, which still 
tastes of chemicals. 

I never, until yesterday, real- 
ized the intellectual and sensual 



joy to be derived from delving 
into Greek drama. 

November 9, 1983 Bimford, Jr. is 
six months old today. Since I gave 
up the last puppy, the house 
seems barnlike in its emptiness. I 
mentioned the fact to Bimford. 

His glance was speculative. “I 
have some money saved. Want a 
tridiversion wall?” 

I was horrified. “Whatever for?” 

He shrugged. “Maybe you’d 
like to go to the library. Get some- 
thing to read.” 

I considered. “Perhaps I will,” I 
said. “There isn’t much for me to 
do, hang diapers and push but- 
tons. Automation has almost com- 
pletely eliminated the housewife’s 
traditional chores.” 

I left Bimford, Jr. with Mother 
and walked to the library. I asked 
the librarian to show me about. 

“What are you interested in?” 
she inquired. 

“I don’t know,” I replied. “Do 
you have any good recent works 
on chemistry or perhaps nuclear 
physics?” 

She raised her eyebrows but 
conducted me to the proper shelf. 
After finding several interesting 
volumes, I also checked out a vol- 
ume on cookery for Bimford. His 
hot chocolate doesn’t improve, 
despite nightly practice. 

He tells me he is working on a 
new project.

U]VfE!” said Lucy. “At an Am- 
bassadorial Banquet!” 
“Don’t be like that now,” said 
Tom, pausing in the night shad- 
ow of a ten-foot-high alien plant, 
something in the shape of a bear- 
trap. He took a last couple of 
drags from his cigaret and 
ground it out underfoot, on the 
footpath of terrazzo tile. 

“How should I be?” 
“Nonchalant,” said Tom. “You 
do this sort of thing every day. 
Ho-hum.” 

“But certainly the Jaktal Am- 
bassador knows you’re only a 
third assistant secretary in the 
Foreign Office’s Department of 
New Governments — ” 

“We hope they won’t know me 
at all. Heh-heh.” 

“You sound nervous, honey.” 
“I am not nervous.” 

“Then why are you biting your 
nails?” 

“I am not biting my nails. I 
never bite my nails. I just thought 
I had something stuck between 
my front teeth, that’s all. I don’t 
know why you always keep talk- 
ing about me biting my nails, 
when you know as well as I do 
. Ah, good evening, Spandul. 
My card. I am Thomas Whit- 
worth Reasoner, and this is my 
mate, Lucy Sue Reasoner. Be- 
ware the zzatz.” 



“You are welcome, sorr!” hissed 
the Spandul, which was about 
three feet high, black, lean as 
a toothpick, and had a mouth 
full of vicious looking needle- 
sharp teeth. It stood just within 
the golden glow of the light from 
the high arched doorway to the 
Jaktal Embassy in Washington. 
Its large eyes glittered at Lucy. 
“Welcome alssso, Lady. Enter 
please. Here you will be safe 
from zzatz.” 

It took their cloaks and they 
proceeded on through the en- 
trance into a long, high-ceilinged 
hall, already well-filled with hu- 
mans and aliens of all varieties, 
all in evening dress. 

“What’s ‘zzatz’?” muttered 
Lucy in Tom’s ear. 

“Means ‘a most unfortunate 
fate’,” muttered Tom back. “Ah, 
good evening, Monsieur Pour- 
toit,” he said in French, “I don’t 
believe you’ve met my wife.” And 
he introduced Lucy to a tall thin 
gentleman with a sad face and 
a broad red ribbon crossing his 
white dress shirt under a dinner 
jacket. The gentleman acknowl- 
edged the introduction graceful- 
ly- 

“Elle est charmante,” he said, 
bowing to Lucy. 

“Why, thank you, Mr. Ambas- 
sador!” said Lucy. “I can see — ” 

“However if you’ll excuse us,” 
said Tom, catching Lucy by the 
hand, “we must be going.”

“Of course,” said M. Pourloit. 
Tom towed Lucy off. 

“Well, all I was going to say 
was — ” whispered Lucy. 

“Ah, Brakt Kul Djok! May I 
present my wife, Mrs. Lucy Sue 
Reasoner?” 

“Well, well, honored I am posi- 
tive!” boomed a large alien, 
looking something like a walrus 
with a stocking cap on. “A fine 
young lady, I can see at a glance, 
hey, boy?” The walrus-sized el- 
bow joggled Tom almost off his 
feet. “See you coming up in the 
world, hey? Hey? Wonder what 
type entertainment and food this 
Jaktal puts out, hah? Never tell 
about these new alien types, 
hey, ho?” 

nnOM laughed heartily and 
they moved on, Tom intro- 
ducing Lucy every few feet to 
some new human or alien of the 
diplomatic circle in Washington. 
Finally they found themselves at 
the punchbowl, and were able to 
fill a couple of glasses and find 
a small alcove out of the crowd. 

“What I don’t understand,” 
said Lucy, “is how they can have 
a banquet for so many different 
kinds of people and aliens. I 
should think — ” 

“Well, they do have a number 
of different foods for those who 
can’t eat anything but their own 
special diet. And of course it’s 
necessary to stay clear of what 



might offend anyone,” said Tom, 
after a large swallow of the 
punch. “But you’d be surprised 
how much in common tastes are 
among different intelligent, ani- 
mal life forms. It’s all flesh and 
plant food, in every case.” 

“But don’t some of them 
taste . .?” said Lucy. 

“Some, of course,” said Tqm. 
“But a lot of alien foods are quite 
tasty. I’ve liked all sorts of di- 
verse items I’ve run into.” 

“Oh!” said Lucy. 

“What’s wrong?” 

“What do you think’s in this 
punch?” said Lucy, examining 
her glass with suspicion. 

“Fruit juice and alcohol. Now,” 
said Tom, “let’s just run over the 
schedule for the evening. First, 
we’ll be having entertainment.” 
“Oh, Tom, wait a minute,” said 
Lucy, interrupting. “Listen. How 
sad!” 

“What?” he said — and then 
he heard it. A voice, around the 
corner from their alcove and 
through an archway leading back, 
was pouring out a thin, sad 
thread of song. He stiffened sud- 
denly. “Wait a minute. I’ll see.” 
He got up and went around 
the corner. Through the archway 
he could see a farther doorway 
from which light was showing. He 
went forward and looked into the 
lighted room beyond. At this 
moment Lucy bumped into him 
from behind. 



176 



GALAXY 



66T TOLD you to wait for me!” 
he whispered angrily at 

her. 

“You did not. You said, ‘wait 
a minute’. Anyway,” said Lucy, 
“there’s nothing here but that 
great big jelly mold on the table.” 
And she pointed to an enormous 
three-tiered mass of what seemed 
to be pink, green and yellow gel- 
atine on a silver box set on a 
white tablecloth. The tablecloth 
was on a table which was the 
only furniture in the room. 

“You know what I meant!” 
said Tom. “And somebody was 
singing here.” 

“It was I,” said the jelly mold 
in sweet and flawless tones of 
English. 

Lucy stared at it. Tom was the 
first to recover. 

“May I present my wife?” he 
said. “Mrs. Lucy Sue Reasoner. 
I am James Whitworth Reasoner, 
Third Assistant Secretary in the 
Foreign Office Earth Department 
of New Governments.” 

“I’m awfully pleased to meet 
you,” said the jelly mold. “I am 
Kotnick, a Bulbur.” 

“Was it a Bulbur song you 
were singing?” asked Lucy. 

“Alas,” said Kotnick, “it is a 
Jaktal song. A little thing I com- 
posed myself but sung, of course, 
in Jaktal — though unfortunate- 
ly with a heavy Bulbur accent.” 

“But you sing so beautifully!” 
said Lucy. “What would it sound 



like if you sang it in Bulbur?” 
“Alas,” said Kotnick, “there is 
no Bulbur to sing it in. There 
is only Jaktal.” 

Lucy looked bewildered. 

“You don’t understand,” Tom 
said to her. “There are a number 
of intelligent races on the Jaktal 
planets. But the Jaktal are the 
ruling ones. The language and 
everything takes its name from 
the rulers.” 

“Indeed, yes,” said the Bulbur. 
“And properly so.” 

“I knew about Spanduls, and 
Gloks, and Naffings,” said Tom, 
looking at it. “But we haven’t 
heard much about you Bulburs 
compared to the rest of the in- 
ferior races of the Jaktal.” 

The Bulbur turned pink all 
over. 

“Pardon my immodesty,” it 
said, “but I have come especially 
for the occasion.” 

“Ah?” said Tom. He stepped 
closer to the Bulbur and lowered 
his voice. “Perhaps, then, you can 
tell me — ” 

“Did the sorr and lady wisssh 
somesing?” interrupted a ' sharp, 
hissing voice. The two humans 
turned abruptly to see a Spandul 
like the one that had admitted 
them to the embassy. It was 
standing in the doorway. Beside 
it was a sort of four-foot worm 
with fang-like teeth curving down 
from its upper lip. 

“Oh!” said Tom. “No. Nothing. 



WHO DARES A BULBUR

177 




Nothing at all. We heard this 
Bulbur singing and wandered in 
to meet it.” 

“It ssshould not sssing!” hissed 
the Spandul, looking at the Bul- 
bur, which quivered and went al- 
most colorless. 

U \X7 ELL ’ it wasn’t really 
singing. Sort of just hum- 
ming. Well, we’ll have to be get- 
ting back to the punch bowl. 
Glad to have met you, Kotnick.” 
Still talking, Tom herded Lucy 
before him past the Spandul and 
the worm-like being and out into 
the shadowy area giving on the 
hall. The worm-like being slith- 
ered past them into the room and 
the Spandul fell in beside the 



humans, its needly teeth glitter- 
ing at them. 

“Guestsss,” it hissed, “will find 
it mossst comfortable in main 
hall area.” 

“I imagine you’re right,” said 
Tom. “We’ll trot on back. Nice 
of you to show us the way. See 
you later, then. May there be no 
zzatz beneath this roof tonight.” 

“There will be no zzatz be- 
neasss ssis roof tonight,” replied 
the Spandul, fixing them with its 
glittering eyes as they moved out 
into the hall. 

“Well,” said Tom. “How about 
another glass of punch, Lucy?” 

“I should say not,” said Lucy. 
She took hold of his sleeve and 
led him back around to the pri- 



178

vacy of their alcove. “Now, sup- 
pose you tell me what’s going on.” 

“Going on?” said Tom. 

“Yes, going on,” said Lucy. 
“And you might as well tell me 
now because I’m going to keep 
after you until you do tell me. I 
thought we were just going to a 
banquet. You didn’t give me any 
notion that it was something un- 
dercover or something like that. 
Now I want you to tell me right 
now — ” she broke off. “What 
are you making faces like that 
for?” 

Tom, besides making faces, 
was scribbling on a piece of paper 
torn from his checkpocket. He 
passed it to her. 

Will you keep quiet? the paper 
read. The walls have ears. I can’t 
tell you. It’s top secret. 

“Oh!” gasped Lucy. Tom took 
the paper from her hands and 
held it up to her lips. 

“Eat it!” he whispered. 

“I certainly will not!” whis- 
pered back Lucy, revolted. 

“Then I’ll have to.” said Tom. 
He took it, and he did. 

“Oh!” said Lucy, impressed. 
Tom was looking at her in an 
unusual way. She shrank back a 
little. 

“Shall we dance?” said Tom. 

“D-dance?” 

His eyebrows wigwagged an- 
grily at her. 

“Oh, dance!” she said. “Of 
course!” 



T^OM led her out across the hall 
and into a sort of garden 
area where a band was playing. 
When they were well out into 
the middle of the dance floor, he 
put his lips close to her ear and 
murmured into it. 

“You might be able to help 
after all.” 

“Yes?” whispered Lucy. 

“The Office Upstairs,” whis- 
pered Tom, “is very concerned 
about this Jaktal race. Six months 
ago, we didn’t even know they 
existed. Now we suddenly dis- 
cover they have a spatial empire 
at least as large as ours. Not 
only that, but the Jaktal them- 
selves — I mean the dominant 
race — seem to have a conqueror 
psychology, judging by their ex- 
pansion and the intelligent races 
like the Spanduls, Naffings, and 
Gloks.” 

“Was that one of them — that 
worm-like thing with the fangs?” 
Lucy asked. 

“A Naffing,” said Tom. “They 
are not much more intelligent 
than an adult chimp. But danger- 
ous. But to get back to the im- 
portant part of the business, 
recent information seems to in- 
dicate that even with our alien 
allies, we’d be at the mercy of 
the Jaktal empire, if they decided 
to move against us right now.” 

“Would they?” Lucy shivered.

“We don’t know. That’s it. • 
Their ambassador talks peaceful 
relations; but we can’t make this 
match up with the character he 
and his subservient races show. 
You’ll see what I mean when you 
get a look at Bu Hjark, the Am- 
bassador.” 

“But what’s it all got to do with 
us — with you?” 

“Well, you remember how they 
thought we did a good job with 
that Oprinkian*? Well, there’s a 
new addition to the Embassy 
here. That Bulbur we just saw. 
He — or it, we don’t even know 
that much yet — seems entirely 
different from the rest of the 
crew here. So what does it mean? 
What’s his place in the organiza- 
tion? What does his showing up 
here mean in terms of the Jaktal 
attitude toward us and our alien 
allies?” 

“I see what you mean,” whis- 
pered Lucy. “Ouch!” 

“What happened?” 

“You just stepped on my toe.” 
“Oh. Sorry.” 

“It’s all right. Go on.” 

66TT’S hard to concentrate on 
two things at once. As I 
was saying, the Office Upstairs 
thought I might be able to get 
the information where somebody 
better known in our diplomatic 



•REX AND MR. REJILLA, Galaxy,

corps might fail. Easier for me to 
be inconspicuous. Of course, 
that’s why I brought you along, 
too.” 

“Well, I like that!” 

“I’m sorry. But that’s the way 
diplomacy is. Now, we’ve had 
one stroke of luck already. We’ve 
found out where the Bulbur is, 
and we know he’s off without a 
crowd around him. The next step 
is up to me. I have to have a 
chance to talk to him alone.” 
“Oh, I see.” 

“Yes,” said Tom, “and I think 
that’s where you can help.” 

“Oh, good.” 

“Do you think you can get 
that Spandul out of the way 
while I have a talk with the Bul- 
bur? I can gas the Naffing. It 
can’t talk and report what’s been 
done to it. But the Spandul 
could, if I gassed him.” 

“Well,” said Lucy, biting her 
lower lip, “I don’t know. It isn’t 
as if he was a man, or something. 
What’ll I do?” 

“He has to be polite to you — 
especially if you can get him out 
where people can see him. You’ll 
think of something.” 

“I hope,” said Lucy. 

“Sure you will. Let’s go,” Tom 
started to lead the way off the 
dance floor and suddenly noticed 
that she was limping. “Ohmigosh, 
I didn’t realize I’d stepped on 
you that hard!” 

“It’s all right,” said Lucy, 



180 



GALAXY 



bravely. “Maybe I can use it as 
an excuse to make him stay with 
me.” 

“That’s an idea,” said Tom. 
They were off the dance floor 
now and he lowered his voice. 
“I’ll tell him I want him to take 
care of you while I go for a 
doctor to make your foot more 
comfortable. Then, when I leave 
you with him, you get him away 
from the entrance there any way 
you can.” 

He broke off suddenly. A fan- 
fare of something like trumpets 
had just silenced all the talk in 
the room. The crowd was split- 
ting apart down the middle, leav- 
ing the center of the floor clear. 
Luckily, Tom and Lucy were al- 
ready on the side of the room 
they wished to reach. 

“I wonder what’s happening?” 
said Lucy. “Oh, dear. I wish we 
had Rex with us.” 

“Rex!” said Tom. “What good 
would it do to have that moose 
of a dog along?” 

“He could keep us in touch 
with each other.” 

“How? Just because we picked 
up enough telepathic sense from 
that Oprinkian to understand 
Rex doesn’t mean he’d be any 
use to us now. What I wish is 
that we’d been able to go one 
step further and understand peo- 
ple’s thoughts. Even each other’s 
thoughts. That’s what we need 
now.” 



46TF Rex was with you and 
trouble came, he’d start 
broadcasting excited thoughts, 
and then I’d know you were in 
trouble.” 

“What good would that do? 
You couldn’t do anything about 
it. No, believe me, Rex would be 
just what we needed to bollix 
things up,” said Tom. “Besides 
I’m happy to have a rest from 
those inane canine thoughts of 
his. ‘Good Tom,’ ‘Good Lucy,’ 
‘play ball?’ — all day long.” 

Tom broke off suddenly. The 
trumpets had sounded again, a 
wild, violent shout of metal 
throats. Now, bounding down 
through the open lane in the mid- 
dle they could see an alien fully 
eight feet tall, approaching and 
bellowing greetings to people in 
the crowd. 

“It’s him,” said Tom. “Him, 
the Jaktal Ambassador, Bu Hj- 
ark. Just look at him!” 

Bu Hjark was a huge lizard- 
like alien, with a heavy, power- 
ful tail. Elbows out, huge hands 
half-clenched, he danced down 
the open space like a boxer 
warming up in the ring. Brilliant 
ribbons and medals covered his 
silver tunic and shorts. Into a 
gem-studded belt was fastened a 
heavy, curve-bladed sword. 

“Ho! Ho! Welcome! Wel- 
come!” he roared. “Great pleasure 
to have you all here! Great pleas- 
ure. Greetings, Brakt Dul Jokt.

Evening, Mr. Vice-President! 
Great evening, isn’t it?. Find 
yourself seats, respected entities, 
and let me show you how the 
Jaktal entertain.” 

“What does he need a sword 
for?” whispered Lucy, staring. 
“With those teeth and nails?” 
“And that tail,” said Tom. 
“Just part of his costume, no 
doubt. Wait until the entertain- 
ment starts. Then we can slip 
off while everybody’s watching.” 
“Positions, everybody!” shout- 
ed Bu Hjark, and added some- 
thing in Jaktal. A crowd of ape- 
like beings in full metal armor 
trotted in and formed a protective 
wall in front of the audience. 
Laughing hugely, Bu Hjark took 
off his sword-belt and tossed it 
to one of these. 

“Gloks,” explained Tom in 
answer to Lucy’s inquiring gaze, 
nodding at the beings in armor. 
“A little brighter than the Naff- 
ings, not so bright as the Span- 
duls. Sort of high-grade morons. 
But extremely strong for their 
size.” 

“First,” Bu Hjark was crying, 
“let in the Bashtash!” 

r I ’'HERE was a moment’s pause, 
then a gasp from the far end 
of the room, drowned out by a 
sudden bestial bellow. Something 
the general shape of a rhinoceros 
but not so large, charged down 
the aisle full tilt at Bu Hark, who 



met it with flailing hands and 
tail, and a deep-chested shout. 
Amid roarings and snarlings, they 
rolled on the floor together. 

“I can’t look,” said Lucy, hid- 
ing her eyes. 

“It’s all right, it’s all over,” 
said Tom, a few moments later. 
“He wrung its neck. See, some 
Gloks are carrying it off.” 

“Now, for the armed Wlack- 
ins!” shouted Bu Hjark. And a 
moment later, a herd of five 
small, centaur-like creatures, 
clutching sharpened stakes, gal- 
loped down upon Bu Hjark, who 
joined battle with them gleefully. 

“Let’s get going,” whispered 
Tom. 

“Yes, let’s,” said Lucy with, a 
shudder. They threaded their 
way through the staring crowd 
to the shadowy corner which led 
back to the room where they had 
discovered the Bulbur. 

“Limp more!” said Tom. He 
guided her toward the lighted 
doorway. “Hey! Spandul?” 

The Spandul they had seen 
earlier emerged from the room. 
Its eyes glittered suspiciously 
upon them. 

“What iss the masser?” it 
hissed. “Guests will be more 
comfortable in main hall.” 

“My mate has hurt herself. I 
insist you give me a hand here,” 
said Tom. “I need help.” 

“Help?” 

“I must get a doctor. Right 



182 



GALAXY 



now!” said Tom. “You under- 
stand? Find her a chair. Look 
after her while I find a doctor!” 
“Doctor?” hissed the Spandul. 
It glanced back into the room 
behind it, and then out again at 
Tom and Lucy. 

“A chair,” moaned Lucy, cling- 
ing to Tom. 

“What’re you waiting for?” 
snapped Tom. “Is this the way 
you do things here at the embas- 
sy? I’ll speak to the Ambassador 
himself about this!” 

“Yesss, yesss. I help,” said the 
Spandul, gliding forward. It took 
hold of the arm of Lucy which 
Tom was not holding. “Chair. 
Thisss way.” 

“Good. Stay with her,” said 
Tom. “I’ll go after a doctor.” 

He turned and plunged back 
into the crowd. As soon as he 
was out of sight, however, he 
stopped, waited for a moment and 
then slowly began to work his 
way back. 

Ill 

XITTHEN he arrived once more 
” at the shadowy entrance, 
it was empty. He slipped quickly 
back to the doorway, taking 
what appeared to be an lifetime 
fountain pen from his pocket as 
he approached the doorway. 
Holding it, he peered inside. The 
Naffing, curled up in a corner, 
reared up at the sight of him. 



He pointed the pen at it and 
pressed the clip. There was an 
almost inaudible pop. The Naf- 
fing wavered a minute and then 
sank down to lie still on the floor. 

“What is it?” fluted the jelly 
on the table, paling to near trans- 
parency. “Have you come to kill 
me: 

“No,” said Tom. He glanced 
behind him and saw the entrance 
still deserted, the crowd still oc- 
cupied with the combat going on. 
He slipped into the room. “I want 
to talk to you.” 

“Take my worthless life, then,” 
keened the jelly. “I have nothing 
worth talking about. 

“Yes, you have,” said Tom. 
“You can tell me about yourself.” 

“Myself?” A little color began 
to flow back into the Bulbur. “Ah, 
I see. It is not me. It is the high 
role I have been chosen to play 
that makes me an object of in- 
terest to you.” 

“Oh? Oh yes, that of course,” 
said Tom. “Let me hear you de- 
scribe it in your own words.” 

The Bulbur turned pink. 

“I am not worthy,” it mur- 
mured. 

“Tell me,” said Tom. The Bul- 
bur turned flame-colored. 

“I am . it began and then 
its voice almost failed it, “the . 
most important item . .” At that 
its voice did fail it. 

“Go on,” said Tom, drawing 
close to it.

EAT?

“I cannot. The emotion in- 
volved is too strong.” 

The Bulbur had deepened its 
red color until it was almost 
black. Its voice seemed strangled 
and unnatural. Tom cast another 
glance at the doorway. 

“All right,” he said. “Let’s talk 
about things you can talk about 
for a moment. Tell me about 
yourself — aside from what you’re 
supposed to do here.” 

“But I am nothing,” sang the 
Bulbur, paling relievedly. “I am 
a mere blob. A shameful blob.” 
“Shameful?” said Tom. 

“Oh, yes,” said the Bulbur, 
earnestly. “A shameful quiver of 
emotions. A useless creature, 
possessing only a voice and the 
power of putting forth weak 
pseudopods to get about. A pus- 
illanimous peace-worshipper in a 
universe at war.” 

“Peace?” Tom stiffened. “Did 
you say peace- worshipper?” 

- “Oh, yes. Yes,” fluted the Bul- 
bur. “It is the main cause of my 
shame. Ah, if only the worlds of 
the universe were oriented to my 
desires!” Its voice sank, and took 
on a note of sad reasonableness, 
not untouched with humor. “But 
obviously, if it had been meant to 
be that way, all life forms would 
be cast in the shape of Bulburs — 
and this, manifestly, is not the 
case.” 

“Look,” said Tom with another 
glance out the doorway, to see 



that the way was still clear, “I’m 
afraid I don’t understand you. 
What do you mean, peace- 
worshipper?” 

“If you will permit me,” said 
the Bulbur humbly. “I might sing 
you a little melody?” 

“Well, if it’ll help,” said Tom. 
“Go ahead.” 

r T , HE Bulbur turned a pale, 
happy pink. A thread of mel- 
ody began to pour forth from it. 
Up until now, Tom had been too 
concerned to figure out how a 
three-layer aspic, even one of 
large size, could manage to talk 
and sing. But now, looking closer, 
he perceived, palely moving and 
pulsating within the body of the 
Bulbur, almost transparent or- 
gans and parts — heart, lungs, and 
throat among others, with a clear 
channel leading to a small mouth 
in the very top of the being. He 
was also suddenly aware of pale, 
almost transparent eyes ringing 
the upper tier like decorations on 
a wedding cake in jelly form. 

But almost as soon as he had 
seen this, he began to forget all 
about it. The melody he was 
listening to began to pass beyond 
mere sound, began to pass be- 
yond mere music. It moved com- 
pletely inside him and became 
a heart-twisting voice speaking 
of peace, beyond any other voice 
that could possibly speak in op- 
position. He felt himself swept 



184 



GALAXY 



away. It was only with a sudden, 
convulsive effort that he broke 
loose from the hold of that voice 
upon him. 

“Wait! Hold it!” he gasped. 
“I get it. I understand.” 

The Bulbur broke off sudden- 
ly, with a sound very much like 
a sob. 

“Excuse me,” it whispered. 
“It’s shameful, I know, but I was 
carried away.” 

“Well, it’s not shameful, exact- 
ly,” said Tom, clearing his throat. 
“I mean — there’s more to life 
than that, of course. But I don’t 
see why you think you have to 
be ashamed of it.” 

“Because,” said the Bulbur, 
going a sad, translucent blue, “it 
is my mark — the mark of my 
difference from all the rest of 
you. I cannot stand to force my 
opinion on anyone else. I have no 
virtues. It is quite right that I 
should suffer.” 

“Suffer?” 

“Ah, indeed — suffer. Oh,” said 
the Bulbur, pinkening again, “it’s 
a great honor, I know. I should 
be rejoicing. But I’m a failure at 
rejoicing, too.” And now it did 
sob, quite distinctly. 

“Wait a minute, now,” said 
Tom. “You seem to have things 
all twisted up. What gives you 
the idea nobody but you prefers 
peace to fighting?” 

The Bulbur turned completely 
transparent. “You mean you also 



find peace to be a pleasant and 
desirable thing?” 

“Of course,” said Tom. 

“Oh — you poor creature,” 
breathed the Bulbur. “How you 
must suffer.” 

“Suffer? Certainly not!” said 
Tom. “We like it peaceful. We 
keep it peaceful.” 

“You keep it peaceful?” 

“Well — most of the time,” said 
Tom, a little guiltily. 

“But what do you do with such 
as the Jaktals, the Spanduls, the 
Gloks and the Naffings?” 

“We — well, we stop them,” 
said Tom. “By force, if neces- 
sary.” 

“But force? Isn’t that coer- 
cion?” said the Bulbur, turning 
pink, chartreuse and mauve in 
that order. “Isn’t that fighting fire 
with fire?” 

“Why not? said Tom. 

r T'HE Bulbur went slowly, com- 
pletely transparent again. 
“Oh, I couldn’t!” it said at last. 
“Certainly. That singing of 
yours is a strong argument. I’d 
think you’d use it.” 

“Oh, no,” said the Bulbur. 
“What if I was successful? That 
would make me a dominator of 
the Jaktals — and the Spanduls.” 
“To say nothing,” said Tom, 
“of the Gloks, Naffings and so 
forth.” He stopped suddenly, 
wondering what had just 
alarmed him. Then he noticed

185 



that the sound of battle from the 
main hall had suddenly ceased. 
“Why shouldn’t you have things 
peaceful if you want them?” 

“Why, it’s not natural,” said 
the Bulbur. “Look at the matter 
logically. If beings had been in- 
tended to live in peace — ” 

“Good-by!” interrupted Tom, 
sprinting out the door. He had 
just noticed the crowd stirring 
and opening in the direction of 
the shadowy entrance and this 
room. He made it to the fringes 
of the crowd in the main hall 
just as a lane parted through 
them and a platoon of Gloks ap- 
peared, marching toward the 
room. Tom slipped down the 
open space behind them to the 
edge of the open area in the cen- 
ter of the floor. A table had just 
been set up in the middle of the 
floor. A Naffing, operating a sort 
of vacuum cleaner, was busy 
cleaning up a few last spots of 
pale blood. Bu Hjark, wearing a 
few neat bandages, his sword re- 
placed, was standing by the table 
directing the Naffing. Tom 
gained a ringside position, and 
all but bumped into Lucy, limp- 
ing around the ring in the oppo- 
site direction. 

“That Spandul finally insisted 
on going to get a doctor, himself. 
I came to warn you to get out,” 
she said. “What happened?” 

Before Tom could answer, 
there was a fanfare of trumpets. 



The crowd opened up again 
alongside them and the platoon 
of Gloks, now bearing the Bulbur 
on its silver stand, marched out 
to the table and set stand and 
Bulbur up in the middle of it. Bu 
Hjark raised his hand for silence 
and barked at the Naffing with 
the vacuum cleaner, which scur- 
ried off. 

“Respected Entities!” boomed 
Bu Hjark. “I now bring you the 
climax to the evening’s enter- 
tainment and the commence- 
ment of the banquet itself. I have 
no doubt, respected Entities, that 
you have on occasion tasted rare 
and fine dishes. However, tonight 
I mean to provide you not mere- 
ly with the finest-tasting food 
you have ever encountered — a 
food which all beings who have 
yet tried it rate better than any 
other thing they have tasted — 
but with certain preliminaries 
and appetizers. After which I 
shall, with my own hand, prepare 
and serve the dish to you.” 

He drew his sword and step- 
ped a little aside from the table. 

“And now,” he said to the Bul- 
bur. “Commence!” 

“R-respected Entities,.” the 
Bulbur began with a slight qua- 
ver. It turned remarkably trans- 
parent, then washed back to blue 
again. “It is a great honor, I as- 
sure you, to be the appetizer to 
your banquet tonight. We Bul- 
burs are a worthless lot, fit only 



186 



GALAXY 



for pleasing the worthwhile pal- 
ates of our betters. It is our one 
pride and pleasure, to know that 
you find us good to — ” the Bul- 
bur swallowed audibly and then 
took up its speech a little more 
rapidly as Bu Hjark scowled at 
it — “eat. I cannot express the 
intense enjoyment — ” it said rap- 
idly “ — that it gives me to be 
here tonight, awaiting my su- 
preme fulfillment as appetizer to 
the banquet you will shortly be 
having. To ensure your unal- 
loyed enjoyment of me, I will 
now,” it said, speeding up even 
more under Bu Hjark’s steely, 
lizard-like eye, “sing you a 
mouth-watering song to increase 
your appreciation of my truly 
unique flavor.” It broke off and 
visibly took a deep breath, 
turned pale, but came steadily 
back to a solid blue color. 

“Tom!” Lucy clutched Tom’s 
elbow with fingers that dug in. 
“It can’t mean we’re going to eat 
it? Tom, do something!” 

“What?” said Tom as a small 
beginning thread of golden mel- 
ody began to emerge, growing in 
volume as it continued, from the 
mouth of the Bulbur. 

“I don’t know. But stop it!” 

r^ESPERATELY, Tom looked 
around him for inspiration. 
He thought of how he had almost 
begun to convince the Bulbur 
that its attitudes were not unique 



in the universe. He thought of 
how effective the Bulbur’s gift of 
song had proved in the room 
when the Bulbur sang to him. 
What we need is another Bulbur 
to sing it into resisting the Jaktal, 
he thought — and, with that, in- 
spiration came to him. He 
opened his mouth and, in his best 
bathroom baritone, burst into 
song: 

“Allons, enfants de la patrie — ” 
he sang. 

Almost with the first word, 
Lucy chimed in with him. Her 
untrained but clear soprano 
picked up the second line. 

“ — Le jour de gloire — Sing!” 
she cried to Monsieur Pourtoit, 
who was standing across the open 
space from them. He bowed to 
her gravely. He looked a little 
puzzled, but after all he was a 
Frenchman. He opened his 
mouth and joined a resonant, 
trained voice to her tones and 
Tom’s. 

“What is this?” roared Bu 
Hjark, spinning around to face 
Tom. His lizard face was agape, 
showing great dog teeth. He 
lifted the sword ominously in his 
hand. Tom swallowed, but con- 
tinued to sing. 

The Marseillaise, the anthem 
of France, was beginning to 
sound its battle cry against tyr- 
anny from other confused but 
cooperative lips. The sword 
swung up. The Gloks turned as

187 




one man toward Tom. Suddenly 
a clear, pure note, two octaves 
above high F, trilled through all 
the sound of the room, striking 
them motionless. The whole 
room turned toward the table. 

f I ''HE fine, thrilling note was 
■*- proceeding from the Bulbur. 
It had stretched upward until it 
was almost twice its original 
height. From what well of knowl- 
edge it had picked up the neces- 
sary information Tom was never 



to discover, but it had changed 
color. Its lowest tier was now red, 
its second tier blue, its top tier 
white. As they all stood, as if 
attention, it broke magnificently 
into the French anthem to 
liberty: 

“Against us long, a tyranny,” 
it sang in wild, masterful accents. 
“A bloody sword has waved on 
high!” 

It was pitching its notes direct- 
ly at Bu Hjark. Those assembled 
saw the full power of the Bul- 



bur’s melody-bom emotional 
might driving through the savage 
ego of the Jaktal like a metal 
blade through the tender body of 
a Bulbur. Now it caught the 
whole assemblage up in its song. 
Spellbound, a chorus of diplo- 
matic and government personnel 
harking from old Sol to the fur- 
thest of the Pleiades, roared to 
the tune of the Marseillaise: 

Too long have you kept us 
subject, 



With your Spanduls, your 
Naffings and your Gloks! 
Why shouldn’t peace be 
sweet? 

Who dares a Bulbur eat? 
Have done! Have done! 

Let there be an end! 

It’s be-autiful PEACE — 

From this hour on, my friend! 



And, as the last great chord 
of voices crashed into silence, the 
huge figure of the Jaktal Ambas- 
sador could be seen to shiver 



188

through all its length and, leaning 
more and more at an angle with 
eyes glazed, topple at last to 
thunder upon the floor like .some 
mighty ruined tower. And the 
voices of the Spanduls and Gloks 
present rose in one great wail, 
crying, “Zzatz! Zzatz! Zzatz . 

When their cries at last died 
away into silence, the Bulbur on 
the table could be seen to have 
taken on an all-over shade of 
perky pink. 

“Jaktals,” it mentioned, in mild 
but audible tones as it leaned 
above the fallen Bu Hjark, “are 
also supposed to be very good 
eating.” 

66 A ND that remark,” said Tom 

-^*-the evening of the next day, 
after he had finished work, waded 
through the softball game in the 
street before their house, patted 
Rex, the Great Dane, and kissed 
Lucy, “will undoubtedly go down 
in the history books as the harsh- 
est statement ever made by an 
adult Bulbur.” 

“But what’s going to happen 
to the Bulburs now?” asked 
Lucy, as she gave Tom a Mar- 
tini and Rex a bowl of Scotch 
and milk. 

“Well, this one told us his race 
doesn’t want anything to do 
with running the Jaktal empire. 
He turned the authority over to 
us humans. All other Bulburs, he 
said, would ratify that move, if 



they were contacted by us — if 
for no other reason than that 
they wouldn’t want to hurt his 
feelings by disagreeing with 
him.” 

“They must be so sensitive!” 
said Lucy. 

“Sensitive,” said Tom, taking 
a glum sip from his Martini, “but 
shrewd. The Bulbur knew very 
well he was turning the authority 
over to people who’d regard it 
as a sacred trust. ‘Greater love 
hath no being than to take on 
authority as a duty rather than 
a privilege,’ he said.” 

“You must admit it was quite 
a compliment,” said Lucy. 

“Yeah,” said Tom, gloomily. 
“We’re in for one hell of an ex- 
pansion. They’re going to make 
me a First Assistant Secretary 
with a full department under me. 
Twice the work — and a ten per 
cent raise in pay.” 

“But imagine,” said Lucy radi- 
antly. “Me! The wife of a First 
Assistant Foreign Secretary!” 
Tom sighed heavily. Rex 
licked his hand. In the pause in 
the conversation the yells from 
the softball game outside pene- 
trated through the living-room 
walls, in spite of their being set 
on full sound-block. It sounded 
to Tom a little like Glok and 
Spandul voices in the distance, 
faintly and forebodingly crying 
“Zzatz! Zzatz!”

rpHE DAY following Col. 

Glenn’s historic round and 
round trip, a prominent official 
called attention to the problem 
that he felt loomed largest ... if 
not most immediately urgent. It 
is becoming obvious even to offi- 
cialdom that we may not be 
alone — out there — and that 
raises the aforementioned prob- 
lem: Communication. 

As we in SF are well aware, 
the problem is enormous. Innum- 
erable author-hours have been 
devoted to it. We have trouble 
communicating with fellow prod- 



ucts of our own cultural environ- 
ment, and present experience 
with electronic language transla- 
tors has demonstrated how tricky 
translating thoroughly known 
languages can be. Explorers 
throughout the centuries have lit- 
erally wound up in the soup 
through failure to recognize or 
comprehend unfamiliar customs. 

How, then, can we expect to 
tackle completely alien concepts? 
A good question, to which many 
people wish we had a good an- 
swer. 

Unfortunately, we have no in-

digenous, non-human, civilized 
races to practice on. However, 
we may have a good substitute

MAN AND DOLPHIN by John 
C. Lilley, M.D. Doubleday & 
Co., Inc. 

One of the most thoroughly 
overworked words in the review- 
er’s vocabulary, the adjective 
“fascinating,” must be pressed in- 
to service to describe the subject 
matter of this book. 

Dr. Lilly opens with these 
words: “Within the next decade 
or two the human species will 
establish communication with an- 
other species: nonhuman, alien, 
possibly extraterrestrial, more 
probably marine, but definitely 
intelligent, perhaps even intellec- 
tual. If no one among us pursues 
the matter before inter-species 
communication is forced upon 
Homo Sapiens by an alien spe- 
cies, this book will have failed in 
its purpose.” 

Provocative introduction, yes? 
Lilly himself is fully engaged in 
the research that he has so ur- 
gently recommended. It is from 
that research that his book has 
taken shape. 

It is a fact that Man is not 
supreme in brain size. Elephants 
and whales have brains four to 
six times as big as ours. However, 



Lilly has ruled out experimenta- 
tion with these species because of 
the great disparity in strength. 
(We are far too vulnerable.) 
There is one species, however, 
that owns a brain comparable in 
size to ours and possesses the 
ability to vocalize. Neither is it 
too difficult to manage. The com- 
mon, bottle-nosed dolphin of 
Marineland fame fills the bill. 

Says Lilly: 

“There are many obstacles to 
mutual understanding. They 
have no written records and make 
no artifacts. They have no hands 
and build nothing. They can 
swim at 20 knots and in a few 
days cover thousands of sea miles 
in search for food or more desir- 
able water temperatures. They 
have no need for clothing or shel- 
ter. Because they do not have to 
resist gravity, they do not need 
to sleep . 

“Dolphins are socially, mutu- 
ally interdependent. A baby is 
not weaned for 18 to 21 months. 
During this period, he is appar- 
ently taught many things by the 
mother on a purely experiential 
and possibly vocal basis . dol- 
phins help one another in dis- 
tress. Sometimes complex and 
concerted action is taken after 
complex vocalization.” 

Libby, finding that dolphins 
can mimic human sounds, is at- 
tempting to teach them our lan- 
guage. One dolphin experimented

with him to determine our range 
of audibility. (Ours ranges from 
0-20 kc, theirs from 0-200 kc.) 

Despite his obvious compas- 
sion and concern, all six of his 
first test subjects died. 

Lilly is pioneering in virgin 
territory. He has to invent experi- 
mental procedures as he pro- 
gresses and failures must out- 
number successes. However, as 
any SFeer can tell him, there is 
a most uncomfortable parallel be- 
tween his investigation and the 
plot of many terror-provoking 
yarns. The theme, humans as ex- 
perimental subjects of an alien 
species, has created acres of 
gooseflesh. Despite Dr. Lilly’s ob- 
vious solicitude, the role of the 
intelligent dolphins evokes em- 
pathy, sympathy and pity. 

Lilly concludes: 

“Even if we are successful, we 
shall still not be fully prepared 
to encounter intelligent life forms 
not of this earth. At most we shall 
have graduated from the kinder- 
garten of inter-species communi- 
cation.” 

THE LONG AFTERNOON OF 
EARTH by Brian Aldiss. Signet 
Books 

The dolphin figures promin- 
ently in Aldiss’s all-stops-removed 
fantasy of a far future and a 
non-revolving earth. Mankind 
has survived also, as a green- 



skinned, tree-dwelling, two-tov,. 
high creature totally intent on 
mere survival in a world in which 
the vegetable has almost totally 
supplanted the animal, whether 
walker, crawler, flyer, burrower 
or predator. It has even produced 
keen intelligence in the form of 
a fungus-like, symbiotic morel. 

Aldiss’s completely engrossing 
yarn is far too involved to ex- 
cerpt, but the problem of inter- 
species communication is ignored: 
All his intelligences speak collo- 
quial English. Despite this, and 
occasional cuteness, Aldiss’s book 
is a tour-de-toTce guaranteed to 
startle the most blase SF buff.

OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET 
by C. S. Lewis. Collier Books 

In Lewis’s classic, a brilliant, 
but shady, scientist and his finan- 
cial partner shanghai a philolo- 
gist friend to serve as a sacrifice 
to weird creatures of Malacandra 
(Mars). (Of course, this descrip- 
tion does no justice whatsoever 



to Lewis’s evocative and provoca- 
tive allegory.) 

The author’s choice of a philol- 
ogist hero neatly solves the com- 
munication problem by providing 
the training necessary to achieve 
a working knowledge of the alien 
language. 

INVADERS FROM THE IN- 
FINITE by John W. Campbell, 
Jr. Gnome Press, Inc. 

“Skylark” Smith’s only real 
competitor for the super-science 
heavyweight title of yore was the 
esteemed editor of Analog. In 
fact, this 30-year-old story of 
time-travel, planet smashing and 
billion-light-year jaunts left 
Campbell no place to go — ex- 
cept to rebel against this type of 
.yarn with his Don A. Stuart 
stories that completely altered 
the course of modern SF. 

Campbell brushes off commu- 
nication by employing thought 
transference via “Ortolian head- 
set” or by the “Venerian tele- 
pathic method.” And so much for 
that subterfuge. 

The communication problem 
may never arise. We may be 
alone, which is unthinkable, or 
our nearest neighbors might be 
too far away to drop in on us. 
But should they, Dr. Lilly’s work 
will be the foundation on which 
our attempt at intercourse will 
rest. — FLOYD C. GALE
