Are you a 
prisoner 

in your 
present job? 

Art you bored with your work? Do you ge bone it uifbt tired fren 
doing nothing? THOSE CAN BE DANGER SIGNALS! 




If you’re like the millions of other 
people before they turned to I.C.S. 
for help, these things are probably 
true about you: 

You’re caught between a job 
with no future and a family to sup- 
port. You’re sour on your job, hate 
to get up in the morning to go to 
work. At night, you’re not much 
fun to have around. 

Unless you do something about 
it, things are going to get worse. 
“Prisoners” aren’t much good to 
their bosses or families. 

And, of course, you can do some- 
thing to “free” yourself ... to get 
a better job, with more money. 
And insure yourself against layoffs 



that come to untrained men. To 
develop interest in your work. To 
earn the respect of your family 
and community. 

MOW I.C.S. CAM HELP 

Faced with such a problem, six 
million people have turned to l.GS. 
for help. TTiey studied at home, in 
their spare time. They developed 
new skills and new knowledge. 

Did it pay off for them? Look at 
the record. In a single 120-day 
period, almost 2000 I.C.S. students 
were promoted to better jobs ! 

Take J. R. Todd. “Already I’m 
netting $120 a month profit on my 
investment,” he says. “And there's 
more to come.”

John R. Musik jumped from 
$180 to $360 a month. O. O. Braun

PAST PERFORMANCE 



f ■''RUE enough, we are just 
barely at the threshold of 
space flight, but we have every 
right to speculate on how our 
colonies on other planets may 
develop. However, it’s only by 
studying the past that we can 
guess shrewdly at the future. The 
trick, of course, is not to get 
stuck in the past, but to use it as 
a departure point. 

. American Ways of Life by 
George R. Stewart (Doubleday) 
does just that. It opens with an 
exciting and entirely legitimate 
speculation: 

“Let us momentarily make use 
of a device of science fiction, and 
imagine a ‘historical’ event that 
never occurred . During one 
of the vigorous and expansive pe- 
riods of the Chinese Empire, one 
of their navigators (who might 
have been named Ko Lum Bo) 
conceived the idea of sailing east- 
ward from China and thus ar- 
riving at Ireland, which was 
known to be the farthest outpost 
of Europe. The Chinese wished 
to reach Ireland, it may be be- 
lieved, because they had heard 
tales that those barbarous island- 
ers made a certain drink called 
Wis Ki. 

“Ko Lum Bo made his voyage, 
and discovered a country that he 
supposed to be part of Ireland, 



although he was disappointed in 
not finding any Wis Ki being 
manufactured by the natives. 

“. The Chinese colonized 
this country, eventually discov- 
ering it to be not Ireland, but a 
wholly new continent. Neverthe- 
less they continued to call the 
natives Irish, or sometimes Red 
Irish. 

“The Chinese colonists intro- 
duced their own well-established 
ways of life. They continued to 
speak Chinese, and to practice 
their own religion ... to use their 
comfortable flowing garments, 
and pagodas dotted the land- 
scape. In short, civilization was 
Asiatic and not European.” 

Exploring the origins of our 
ways of life in language, religion, 
food, drink, clothing, shelter, sex, 
personal names, play, holidays 
and art, Stewart proves that these 
are established mostly by the 
conditioning — he calls it hered- 
ity, which is confusing — of the 
first settlers. Those who come 
after contribute words, phrases, 
cookery, but tend generally to be 
assimilated in all ways except, 
perhaps, religion. 

Names, for example, are ex- 
changed for “American” ones — 
actually English in most cases. 
The desire to conform is only

HELPFULLY YOURS 



"Come down to Earth— and stay there!" is a 
humiliating order for somebody with wings! 




T ARB Morfatch had read 
all the information on Ter- 
restrial customs that was 
available in the Times morgue 
before she’d left Fizbus. And all 
through the journey she’d studied 
her Brief Introduction to Terres- 
trial Manners and Mores avidly. 
Perhaps it was a bit overinspira- 
tional in spots, but it had facts 
in it, too. 

So she knew that, since the na- 
tives were non-alate, she was not 



to take wing on Earth. She had, 
however, forgotten to correlate 
the knowledge of their wingless- 
ness with her own vertical habits. 
As a result, on leaving the tender 
that had ferried her down from 
the Moon, she looked up instead 
of right and narrowly escaped 
death at the jaws of a raging 
groundcar that swerved out onto 
the field. 

She recognized it as a taxi 
from one of the pictures in the 



Illustrated by EMSH 



HELPFULLY YOURS

handbook. It was a pity, she 
thought sadly as she was knocked 
off her feet, that all those lessons 
she had so carefully learned were 
to go to waste. 

But it was only the wind of 
the car’s passage that had thrown 
her down. As she struggled to get 
up, hampered by her awkward 
native skirts, the door of the taxi 
flew open. A tall young man — a 
Fizbian — burst out, the soft yel- 
lowish-green down on his hand- 
some face bristling with fright 
until each feather stood out sepa- 
rately. 

“Miss Morfatch! Are you all 
right?” 

“Just — just a little shaky,” she 
murmured, brushing dirt from her 
rosy leg feathers. Too young to 
be Drosmig; too good-looking to 
be anyone important, she thought 
glumly. Must be the office boy. 

To her surprise, he didn’t help 
her up. Probably it Would violate 
some native taboo if he did, she 
deduced. The handbook hadn’t 
mentioned anything that seemed 
to apply, but, after all, a little 
book like that couldn’t cover ev- 
erything. 

S HE could see the young man 
was embarrassed — his emerald 
crest was waving to and fro. 

“I’m Stet Zamon,” he intro- 
duced himself awkwardly. 

The Managing Editor! The 
handsome young employer of her 



girlish dreams! But perhaps he 
had a wife on Fizbus — no, the 
Grand Editor made a point of 
hiring people without families to 
use as a pretext for expensive 
vacations on the Home Planet. 

As she opened her mouth to 
say something brilliantly witty, 
to show she was no ordinary fe- 
male but a creature of spirit and 
fire and intelligence, a sudden ca- 
cophony of shrill cries and ex- 
plosions arose, accompanied by 
bursts of light. Her feathers stood 
erect and she clung to her em- 
ployer with both feathered legs. 

“If these are the friendly dip- 
lomatic relations Earth and Fiz- 
bus are supposed to be enjoying,” 
she said, “I’m not -enjoying them 
one bit!” 

“They’re only taking pictures 
of you with native equipment,” 
he explained, pulling away from 
her. What was the matter with 
him? “You’re the first Fizbian 
woman ever to come to Terra, 
you know.” 

She certainly did know — and, 
what was more, she had made 
the semi-finals for Miss Fizbus 
only the year before. Perhaps he 
had some Terrestrial malady he 
didn’t want her to catch. Or could 
it be that in the four years he had 
spent in voluntary exile on this 
planet, he had come to prefer the 
native females? Now it was her 
turn to shrink from him. 

He was conversing rapidly in 



8 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Terran with the chattering na- 
tives who milled about them. Al- 
though Tarb had been an honors 
student in Terran back at school, 
she found herself unable to un- 
derstand more than an occasional 
word of what they said. Then she 
remembered that they were not at 
the world capital, Ottawa, but 
another community, New York. 
Undoubtedly they were all speak- 
ing some provincial dialect pe- 
culiar to the locality. 

And nobody at all booed in 
appreciation, although, she told 
herself sternly, she really couldn’t 
have expected them to. Standards 
of beauty were different in differ- 
ent solar systems. At least they 
were picking up as souvenirs some 
of the feathers she’d shed in her 
tumble, which showed they took 
an interest. 

Stet turned back to her. “These 
are fellow-members of the press.” 

She was able to catch enough 
of what he said next in Terran to 
Understand that she was being 
formally introduced to the abo- 
riginal journalists. Although you 
could never call the natives at- 
tractive, with their squat figures 
and curiously atrophied vestigial 
wings — arms, she reminded her- 
self — they were very Fizboid in 
appearance and, with their wing- 
lessness cloaked, could have cred- 
itably passed for singed Fizbians. 

Moreover, they seemed friend- 
ly; at any rate, the sounds they 



uttered were welcoming. She be- 
gan to make the three ritual en- 
trechats, but Stat stopped her. 
“Just smile at them; that’ll be 
enough.” 

It didn’t seem like enough, but 
he was the boss. 

“r ■ tHANK the stars we’re 
through with that,” he sigh- 
ed, as they finally were able to 
escape their confreres and get into 
the taxi. “I suppose,” he added, 
wriggling inside the clumsy Ter- 
restrial jacket which, cut to fit 
over his wings, did nothing either 
to improve his figure or to make 
him look like a native, “it was as 

much of an ordeal for you as for 

, _ >» 
me. 

“Well, I am a little bewildered 
by it all,” Tarb admitted, settl- 
ing herself as comfortably as pos- 
sible on the seat cushions. 

“No, don’t do that!” he cried. 
“Here people don’t crouch on 
seats. They sit,” he explained in 
a kindlier tone. “Like this.” 

“You mean I have to bend my- 
self in that clumsy way?” 

He nodded. “In public, at 
least.” 

“But it’s so hard on the wings. 
I’m losing feathers foot over 
claw.” 

“Yes, but you could . .” He 
stopped. “Well, anyhow, remem- 
ber we have to comply with local 
customs. You see, the Terrestrials 
have those things called arms 



HELPFULLY YOURS

instead of legs. That is, they have 
legs, but they use them only for 
walking.” 

She sighed. “I’d read about the 
arms, but I had no idea the na- 
tives would be so — so primitive 
as to actually use them.” 

“Considering they had no 
wings, it was very clever of them 
to make use of the vestigial ap- 
pendages,” he said hotly. “If you 
take their physical limitations in- 
to account, they’ve done a mar- 
velous job with their little planet. 
They can’t fly; they have very 
little sense of balance; their vi- 
sion is exceedingly poor — yet, in 
spite of all that, they have achiev- 
ed a quite remarkable degree of 
civilization.” He gestured toward 
the horizontal building arrange- 
ments visible through the window. 
“Why, you could almost call 
those streets. As a matter of 
fact, the natives do.” 

At the moment, she could take 
an interest in Terrestrial civili- 
zation only as it affected her per- 
sonally. “But I’ll be able to relax 
in the office, won’t I?” 

“To a certain extent,” he re- 
plied cautiously. “You see, we 
have to use a good deal of native 
help because — well, our facilities 
are limited . .” 

“Oh,” she said. 

Then she remembered that she 
was on Terra at least partly to 
demonstrate the pluck of Fiz- 
bian femininity. Back on Fizbus, 



most of the Times executives had 
been dead set against having a 
woman sent out as Drosmig’s as- 
sistant. But Grupe, the Grand 
Editor, had overruled them. 
“Time we broke with tradition,” 
he had said. He’d felt she could 
do the job, and, by the stars, she 
would justify his faith in her! 

“Sounds like rather a lark,” 
she said hollowly. 

S TET brightened. “That’s the 
girl!” His eyes, she noticed, 
were emerald shading into tur- 
quoise, like his crest. “I certainly 
hope you’ll like it here. Very wise 
of Grupe to send a woman 'in- 
stead of a man, after all. 
Women,” he went on quickly, 
“are so much better at working 
up the human interest angle. 
And Drosmig is out of commis- 
sion most of the time, so it’s you 
who’ll actually be in charge of 
‘Helpfully Yours.’ ” 

She herself in charge of the 
column that had achieved inter- 
stellar fame in three short years! 
Basically, it had been designed to 
give guidance, advice and, if nec- 
essary, comfort to those Fizbians 
who found themselves living oh 
Terra, for the Fizbus Times had 
stood for public service from time 
immemorial. As Grupe had put 
it, “We don’t run this paper for 
ourselves, Tarb, but for our read- 
ers. And the same applies to our 
Terrestrial edition.”

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



With the growing development 
of trade and cultural relations 
between the two planets, the 
Fizbians on Earth were an ever- 
increasing number. But they were 
not the only readers of “Help- 
fully Yours.” Reprinted in the 
parent paper, it was read with 
edification and pleasure all over 
Fizbus. Everyone wanted to learn 
more about the ancient and 
other-worldly Terran culture. 

The handbook, A Brief Intro- 
duction to Terrestrial Manners 
and Mores, owed much of its 
content to “Helpfully Yours.” A 
grateful, almost fulsome, intro- 
ductory note had said so. But the 
column truly deserved all the 
praise that had been lavished up- 
on it by the handbook. How well 
she had studied the thoughtful 
letters that filled it and the ex- 
cellent and well-reasoned advice 
— erring, if it erred at all, on the 
side of overtolerance — that had 
been given in return. Of course, 
on Earth, spiritual adjustment 
apparently was more important 
than the physical; you could tell 
that from the questions that were 
asked. A number of the letters 
had been reprinted in an appen- 
dix to the manual. 

New York 

Dear Senbot Drosmig : 

When in contact with Terres- 
trial culture, I find myself con- 
stantly overawed and weighed 



down by the knowledge of my 
own inadequacy. I cannot seem 
to appreciate the local art forms 
as disseminated by the juke box, 
the comic strip, the tabloid. 

How can I help myself toward 
a greater understanding? 

Hopefully yours, 

Gnurmis Plitt 

Dear Mr. Plitt: 

Remember, Orkv was not ex- 
cavated in a week. It took the 
Terrestrials many centuries to 
develop their -exquisite and eso- 
teric art forms. How can you 
expect to comprehend them in 
a few short years? Expose your- 
self to their art. Work, study, 
meditate. 

Understanding will come, I 
promise you. 

Helpfully yours, 

Senbot Drosmig 

Paris 

Dear Senbot Drosmig: 

To think that I am enjoying 
the benefits of Terra while my 
wife and little ones are forced to 
remain on Fizbus makes my 
heart ache. Surely it is not fair 
that I should have so much and 
they so little. Imagine the ines- 
timable advantage to the fledg- 
ling of even a short contact with 
Terrestrial culture! 

Why cannot my loved ones 
come to join me so that we can 
share all these wonderful spir- 
itual experiences and be enriched 



HELPFULLY YOURS

by them together? 

Poignantly yours, 

Tpooly N’Ox 

Dear Mr. N’Ox: 

After all, it has been only 
five years since Fizbian space- 
ships first came into contact 
with Terra. In keeping with our 
usual colonial policy — so in- 
appropriate and anachronistic 
when applied to a well-devel- 
oped civilization like Terra’s — 
at first only males are allowed 
to go to the new world until it 
is made certain over a period 
of years that the planet is safe 
for mothers and future moth- 
ers of Fizbus. 

But Stet Zarnon himself, the 
celebrated and capable editor 
of the Terran edition of The 
Fisbus Times, has taken up 
your cause, and I promise you 
that eventually your loved ones 
will be able to join you. 

Meanwhile, work, study, 
meditate. 

Helpfully yours, 

Senbot Drosmig 

Ottawa 

Dear Senbot Drosmig : 

Having just completed a two- 
year tour of - duty on Earth as 
part of a diplomatic mission, I 
am regretfully leaving this fair 
planet. What books, what objects 
of art, what, in short, souvenirs 
shall I take back to Fizbus which 
will give our people some small 



idea of Earth’s rich cultural her- 
itage and, at the same time, serve 
as useful and appropriate gifts 
for my friends and relatives back 
Home? 

Inquiringly yours, 

Solgus Zagroot 
Dear Mr. Zagroot: 

Take back nothing but your 
memories. They will be your 
best souvenirs. 

Out of context, any other 
mementos might convey little, 
if anything, of the true beauty 
and advanced spirituality of 
Terrestrial culture, and you 
might cheapen them were you 
to use them crassly as souve- 
nirs. Furthermore, it is possi- 
ble that you, in your ignorance, 
might unwittingly select some 
items that give a distorted and 
faldfe idea of our extrafizbian 
friends. 

The Fizbian-Earth Cultural 
Commission, sponsored by The 
Fizbian Times, in conjunction

Helpfully yours, 

Senbot Drosmig 

A ND now she — Tarb Morfatch 
*’*■ — herself was going to be 
the guiding spirit that brought 
enlightenment and uplift to 
countless thousands on Terra 
and millions on Fizbus. Her 
name wouldn’t appear on the col- 
umns, but the reward of having 
helped should be enough. Be- 
sides, Drosmig was due to retire 
soon. If she proved herself com- 
petent, she would take over the 
column entirely and get the by- 
line. Grupe had promised faith- 
fully. 

But what, she wondered, had 
put Drosmig “out of commis- 
sion”? 

The taxi drew up before a 
building with a vulgar number 
of floors showing above ground. 

“Ah — before we- — er — meet the 
others,” Stet suggested, twitching 
his crest, “I was wondering 
whether you would care to — er — 
have dinner with me tonight?” 

This roused Tarb from her 
speculations. “Oh, I’d love to!” 
A date with the boss right away! 

Stet fumbled in his garments 
for appropriate tokens with 
which to pay the driver. “You — 
you’re not engaged or anything 
back Home, Miss Morfatch?” 



“Why, no,” she said. “It so 
happens that I’m not.” 

“Splendid!” He made an abor- 
tive gesture with his leg, then let 
her get out of the taxi by herself 
“It makes the natives stare,” he 
explained abashedly. 

“But why shouldn’t they?” she 
asked, wondering whether to 
laugh or not. “How could they 
help but stare? We are different.” 
He must be joking. She ventured 
a smile. 

He smiled back, but made no 
reply. 

The pavement was hard under 
her thinly covered soles. Now 
that walking looked as if it would 
present a problem, the ban on 
wing use loomed more threaten- 
ingly. She had, of course, walked 
before — on wet days when her 
wings were waterlogged or in 
high winds or when she had sur- 
face business. However, the side- 
walks on Fizbus were soft and 
resilient. Now she understood 
why the Terrestrials wore such 
crippling foot armor, but that 
didn’t make her feel any better 
about it. 

A box-shaped machine took 
the two Fizbians up to the twen- 
tieth story in twice the time it 
would have taken them to fly the 
same distance. Tarb supposed 
that the offices were in an attic 
instead of a basement because 
exchange difficulties forced the 
Times to such economy. She

wondered ruefully whether her 
own expense account would also 
suffer. 

But it was no time to worry 
about such sordid matters; most 
important right now was making 
a favorable impression on her 
co-workers. She did want them 
to like her. 

Taking out her compact, she 
carefully polished her eyeballs. 
The man at the controls of the 
machine practically performed a. 
ritual entrechat. 

“Don’t do that!” Stet ordered 
in a harsh whisper. 

“But why not?” she asked, un- 
able to restrain a trace of bel- 
ligerence from her voice. He 
hadn’t been very polite himself. 
“The handbook said respectable 
Terran women make up in pub- 
lic. Why shouldn’t I?” 

H E sighed. “It’ll take time for 
you to catch on, I suppose. 
There’s a lot the handbook does- 
n’t — can’t — cover. You’ll find the 
setup here rather different from 
on Fizbus,” he went on as he 
kicked open the door neatly let- 
tered THE FIZBUS TIMES in 
both Fizbian and Terran. “We’ve 
found it expedient to follow the 
local newspaper practice. For in- 
stance — ” he indicated a small 
green-feathered man seated at a 
desk just beyond the railing that 
bisected the room horizontally — 
“we have a Copy Editor.” 



“What does he do?” she asked, 
confused. 

“He copies news from the other 
papers, of course.” 

“And what are you doing to- 
night, Miss Morfatch?” the Copy 
Editor asked, springing up from 
his desk to execute the three rit- 
ual entrechats with somewhat 
more verve than was absolutely 
necessary. 

“Having dinner with me,” Stet 
said quickly. 

“Pulling rank, eh, old bird? 
Well, we’ll see whether position 
or sterling worth will win out in 
the end.” 

As the rest of the staff crowded 
around Tarb, leaping and booing 
as appreciatively as any girl 
could want, she managed to 
snatch a rapid look around. The 
place wasn’t really so very much 
different from a Fizbian news- 
room, once she got over the odd- 
ity of going across, not up and 
down, with the desks — queerly 
shaped but undeniably desks — 
arranged side by side instead of 
one over the other. There were 
chairs and stools, no perches, but 
that was to be expected in a 
wingless society. And it was 
noisy. Even though the little ma- 
chines had stopped clattering 
when she came in, a distant roar- 
ing continued, as if, concealed 
somewhere close by, larger, more 
sinister machines continued their 
work. A peculiar smell hung in 



14 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the air — not unpleasant, exactly, 
but strange. 

She sniffed inquiringly. 

“Ink,” Stet said. 

“What’s that?” 

“Oh, some stuff the boys in the 
back shop use. The feature writ- 
ers,” he went on quickly, before 
she could ask what the “back 
shop” was, “have private offices 
where they can perch in comfort.” 

He led the way down a corri- 
dor, opening doors. “Our drama 
editor.” He indicated a middle- 
aged man with faded blue feath- 
ers, who hung head downward 
from his perch. “On the lobster- 
trick last night writing a review, 
so he’s catching fifty-one twin- 
kles now.” 

“Enchanted, Miss Morfatch,” 
the critic said, opening one bright 
eye. “By a curious chance, it so 
happens that tonight I have two 
tickets to — ” 

“Tonight she’s going out with 
»» 

me. 

“Well, I can get tickets to any 
play, any night. And you haven’t 
laughed unless you’ve seen a 
Terrestrial drama. Just say the 
word, chick.” 

Stet got Tarb out of the office 
and slammed the door shut. 
“Over here is the office of our 
food editor,” he said, breathing 
hard, “whom you’ll be expected 
to give a claw to now and then, 
since your jobs overlap. Can’t in- 
troduce you to him right now, 



though, because he’s in the hos- 
pital with ptomaine poisoning. 
And this is the office you’ll share 
with Drosmig.” 

Stet opened the door. 

U NDERNEATH the perch, 
Senbot Drosmig, dean of 
Fizbian journalists, lay on the 
rug in a sodden stupor, letters to 
the editor scattered thickly over 
his shriveled person. The whole 
room reeked unmistakably of 
caffeine. 

Tarb shrank back and twined 
both feet around Stet’s. This 
time he did not repulse her. “But 
how can a — an educated, cul- 
tured man like Senbot Drosmig 
sink to such depths?” 

“It’s hard for anyone with even 
the slightest inclination toward 
the stuff to resist it here,” Stet 
replied somberly. “I can’t deny 
it; the sale of caffeine is abso- 
lutely unrestricted on Earth. 
Coffee shops all over the place. 
Coffee served freely at even the 
best homes. And not only coffee 
. caffeine is insiduously present 
in other of their popular bev- 
erages.” 

Her eyes bulged sideways. 
“But how can a so-called civ- 
ilized people be so depraved?” 
“Caffeine doesn’t seem to affect 
them the way it does us. Their 
nervous systems are so very un- 
complicated, one almost envies 
them.”

Drosmig stirred restlessly un- 
der his blanket of correspond- 
ence. “Go back . Fizbus,” he 
muttered. “Warn you . ’fore 
. too late . like me.” 
Tarb’s rose-pink feathers stood 
on end. She looked apprehen- 
sively at Stet. 

“Senbot can’t go back because 
he’s in no shape to take the in- 
terstel drive.” The young editor 
was obviously annoyed. “He’s 
old and he’s a physical wreck. 
But that certainly doesn’t apply 
to you, Miss Morfatch.” He 
looked long and hard into her 
eyes. 

“Few years on planet,” Dros- 
mig groaned, struggling to his 
wings, “ ’ply to anybody.” 

His feathers, Tarb noticed, 
were an ugly, darkish brown. She 
had never seen any one that color 
before, but she’d heard rumors 
that too much caffeine could do 
that to you. At least she hoped it 
was only the caffeine. 

“For your information, he was 
almost as bad as this when he 
came!” Stet snapped. “Frankly, 
that’s why he was sent here — to 
get rid of his unfortunate addic- 
tion. Grupe had no idea, when he 
assigned him to Earth, that there 
was caffeine on the planet.” 

The old man gave a sardonic 
laugh as he clumsily made his 
way to the perch and gripped it 
with quivering toes. 

“That is, I don’t think he 



knew,” Stet said dubiously. 

Tarb reached over and picked 
a letter off the floor. The Fizbian 
characters were clumsy and ill- 
made, as if someone had formed 
them with his feet. Could there 
be such poverty here that indi- 
viduals existed who could not af- 
ford a scripto? The letter didn’t 
read like any that had ever been 
printed in the column — at least 
none that had been picked up in 
the Fizbus edition: 

New York 

Dear Senbot Drosmig: 

I am a subaltern clerk in the 
shipping department of the Fizb- 
Earth Trading Company, Inc. 
Although I have held this post 
for only three months, I have £tl- 
ready won the respect and esteem 
of my superiors through my dili- 
gence and good character. My 
habits are- exemplary: I do not 
gamble, sing, or take caffeine. 

Earlier today, while engaged in 
evening meditation at my modest 
apartments, I was aroused by a 
peremptory knock at the door. I 
dung it open. A native stood 
there with a small case in his 
hand. 

"Is the house on fire?” I asked, 
wondering which of my few hum- 
ble possessions I should rescue 
first. 

"No," he said. “I would like to 
interest you in some brushes.” 

“ Are the offices of the Fizb- 



16 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Earth Trading Company, Inc., 
on Bre?" 

“Not to my knowledge he re- 
plied, opening his case. “Now I 
have here a very nice hair- 
brush — ” 

I wanted to give him every 
chance. “Have you come to tell 
me of any disaster relative to the 
FizbEarth Trading Company, to 
myself, or to anyone or anything 
else with whom or with which I 
run connected?” 

“Why, no,” he said. “I have 
come to sell you brushes. Now 
here is a little number I know 
you’ll like. My company devel- 
oped it with you folks specially 
in mind. It’s — ” 

“Do you know, sir, that you 
have wantonly interrupted me in 
the midst of my meditations, 
which constitutes an established 
act of privacy violation?" 

“Is that a fact? Now this lit- 
tle item is particularly designed 
for brushing the wings — ” 

At that point, I knocked him 
down and punched him into in- 
sensibility with my feet. Then I 
summoned the police. To my 
surprise, they arrested me in- 
stead of him. 

I am writing this letter '■from 
jail. I do not like to ask my em- 
ployers to get me out because, 
even though I am innocent, you 
know how a thing like this can 
leave a smudge on the record. 

What shall I do? 



Anxiously yours, 

Fruzmus Bloxx 

W HAT should he do?” Tarb 
asked, handing Stet the 
paper. “Or is the question aca- 
demic by now? The letter’s five 
days old.” 

Stet sighed. “I’ll find out 
whether the consulate has been 
notified. Native police usually do 
that, you know. Very thoughtful 
fellows. If this Bloxx hasn’t been 
bailed out already, I’ll see that 
he is.” 

“But how will we answer his 
letter? Advise him to sue for 
false arrest?” 

Stet smiled. “But he has no 
grounds for false arrest. He is 
guilty of assault. The native was 
entirely within his rights in try- 
ing to sell him a brush. Now — ” 
he put out a foot — “brace your- 
self. Privacy violation is not a 
crime on Terra. It is perfectly le- 
gal. In fact, it does not exist as 
such!” 

At that point, everything went 
maroon. 

When Tarb came to, she found 
herself lying upon Drosmig’s 
desk. A skin-faced rtative woman 
was offering her water and 
clucking. 

“Are you all right, Tarb — Miss 
Morfatch?” Stet demanded anx- 
iously. 

“Yes. I — I think so,” she mur- 
mured, raising herself to a crouch.

“Better . have died,” Dros- 
mig groaned from his perch. 
“Fate worse . death . awaits 
you.” 

Tarb tried to smile. “Sorry to 
have been so much trouble.” She 
stuck out her tongue at both Stet 
and the native. 

The woman drew in her breath. 

“Miss Morfatch,” Stet remind- 
ed Tarb, “sticking out the tongue 
is not an apology on Terra; it is 
an insult. Fortunately, Miss 
Snow happens to be perhaps the 
only Terran who would not be 
offended. She has become thor- 
oughly acquainted with us and 
our odd little customs. She 
even — ” he beamed at the Terran 
female — “has learned to speak 
our language.” 

“Hail to thee, O visitor from 
the stars,” Miss Snow said in 
Fizbian. “May thy sojourn upon 
Earth be an incessant delight and 
may peace and plenty shower 
their gifts in abundance upon 
thee.” 

Tarb put her hand to her ach- 
ing head. “I’m very glad to meet 
you,” she said, glad she did not 
have to get up to make the ritual 
entrechats. 

“Miss Snow is my right foot,” 
Stet said, “but I’m going to be 
noble and let her act as your sec- 
retary until you can learn to op- 
erate a typewriter.” 

“Secretary? Typewriter?” 

“Well, you see, there are no 



scriptos or superscriptos on Earth 
and we can’t import any from 
Home because the natives — ” 
Miss Snow smiled — “don’t have 
the right kind of power here to 
run psychic installations. All 
prosifying has to be done direct- 
ly on prosifying machines or — ” 
he paused — “by foot.” 

“Catch her!” Miss Snow ex- 
claimed in Terran. 

Everything had gone maroon 
for Tarb again. As she fell, she 
could hear a sodden thump. It 
was, she later discovered, Dros- 
mig falling off his perch again — 
the result of insecure grip, she 
was given to understand, rather 
than excessive empathy. 

“T didn’t mean, of course, to 
give you the impression that 
we actually produce the individ- 
ual copies of the papers our- 
selves,” Stet explained over the 
dinner table that night. “We 
have native printers who do that. 
They’ve turned out some really 
remarkable Fizbian type fonts.” 
“Very clever of them,” Tarb 
said, knowing that was what she 
was expected to say. She glanced 
around the restaurant. In their 
low-cut evening garments, the 
Terrestrial females looked much 
less Fizboid than they had dur- 
ing the day. All that naked-look- 
ing skin; one would think they’d 
want to cover it. Probably they 
were sick with jealousy of her

beautiful rose-colored down — 
what they could see of it, any- 
way. 

“Of course, our real problem is 
getting proofreaders. The proof- 
ing machines won’t operate here 
either, of course, and so we need 
human personnel. But what Fiz- 
bian would do such degrading 
work? We had thought of convict 
labor, but — ” 

“Why mustn’t I take off my 
wrap?” Tarb interrupted. “No 
one else is wearing one.” 

Stet coughed. “You’ll feel 
much less self-conscious about 
your wings if you keep it on. And 
try not to use your feet so con- 
spicuously. I’m sure everyone 
understands you need them to 
eat with, but — ” 

“But I’m not in the least self- 
conscious about my wings. On 
Fizbus, they were considered 
rather nice-looking, if I do say so 
myself.” 

“It’s better,” he said firmly, 
“not to emphasize the differences 
between the natives and our- 
selves. You didn’t object to wear- 
ing a Terrestrial costume, did 
you?” 

“No, I realize I must make 
some concessions to native pru- 
dery, but — ” 

“Matter of fact, I’ve been 
thinking it would be a good idea 
for you to wear a stole or a cape 
or something in the daytime 
when you go to and from the 



office. You wouldn’t want to 
make yourself or the Times con- 
spicuous, I’m sure . No, waiter, 
no coffee. We’ll take champagne.” 
“I want to try coffee,” Tarb 
said mutinously. “Champagne! 
You’d think I was a fledgling, giv- 
ing me that bubbly stuff!” 

He looked at her. “Now don’t 
be silly, Miss Morfatch . Tarb. 
I can’t let you indulge in such 
rash experiments. You realize I 
am responsible for you.” 

Tarb muttered darkly into her 
coupe maison. 

Stet raised his eyebrows. 
“What did you say?” 

“I was only wondering whether 
you’d remembered to check on 
whether that young man — Bloxx 
— ever did get out of jail.” 

Stet snapped his toes. “Glad 
you reminded me. Completely 
slipped my mind. Let’s go and 
see what happened to him, shall 
we?” 

A S they rose to leave, a dumpy 
Earthwoman rushed up to 
them, enthusiastically babbling 
in Terran. Seizing Tarb’s foot, 
she clung to it before the Fizbian 
girl could do anything to prevent 
her. Tarb had to spread her 
wings wide to retain her balance. 
Her cloak flew off and an adjoin- 
ing table of diners disappeared 
beneath it. 

Stet and the headwaiter rushed 
to the rescue with profuse apolo-

gies, Stet’s crest undulating as if 
it concealed a nest of snakes. But 
Tarb was too much frightened to 
be calmed. 

“Is this a hostile attack?” she 
shrieked frantically at Stet. “Be- 
cause the handbook never said 
shaking feet was an Earth cus- 
tom!” 

“No, no, she’s a friend!” Stet 
yelled, leaving the diners still 
struggling with the cloak as he 
sped back to her. “And shaking 
feet isn’t an Earth custom; she 
thinks it’s a Fizbian one. You see 
. Oh, hell, never mind — I’ll 
explain the whole thing to you 
later. But she’s just greeting you, 
trying to put you at your ease. 
It’s Belinda Romney, a very im- 
portant Terrestrial. She owns the 
Solar Press — you must have 
heard of it even on Fizbus — big- 
gest news service on the planet. 
Absolutely wouldn’t do to offend 
her. Mrs. Romney, may I present 
Miss Morfatch?” 

The woman beamed and con- 
tinued to gush endlessly. 

“Tell her to let go my foot!” 
Tarb demanded. “It’s getting so 
it feels carbonated.” 

He smiled deprecatingly. “Now, 
Tarb, we mustn’t be rude — ” 
For the first time in her life, 
Tarb spoke Terran to a Terres- 
trial. She formed the words slow- 
ly and carefully : “Sorry we must 
leave, but we have to go to jail.” 
She looked to Stet for approval 



. and didn’t get it. He started 
to explain something quickly to 
the woman. Every time she’d 
heard him speak Terran, Tarb 
thought, he seemed to be intro- 
ducing, explaining or apologizing. 

It turned out that, through 
some oversight, the usually

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



thoughtful Terran police depart- 
ment had neglected to inform the 
Fizbian consul that one of his 
people had been incarcerated, for 
the young man had already been 
tried, found guilty of assault plus 
contempt of court, and sentenced 
to pay a large fine. However, aft- 



er Stet had given his version of 
the circumstances to a sympa- 
thetic judge, the sum was reduced 
to a nominal one, which the 
Times paid. 

“But I don’t see why you 
should have paid anything at 
all,” Bloxx protested ungrate-

fully. “I didn’t do anything 
wrong. You should have made an 
issue of it.” 

“According to Earth laws, you 
did do wrong,” Stet said wearily, 
“and this is Earth. What’s more, 
if we take the matter up, it will 
naturally get into print. You 
don’t want your employers to 
hear about it, do you — even if 
you don’t care about making 
Fizbians look ridiculous to Ter- 
restrials?” 

“I suppose I wouldn’t like 
FizbEarth to find out,” Bloxx 
conceded. “As it is, I’ll have to 
do some fast explaining to ac- 
count for my not having shown 
up for nearly a week. I’ll say I 
caught some horrible Earth dis- 
ease — that’ll scare them so much, 
they’ll probably beg me to take 
another week off. Though I do 
wish you fellows over at the 
Times would answer your mail 
sooner. I’m a regular subscriber, 
you know.” 

“T>UT the same kind of thing’s 
going to happen over and 
over again, isn’t it, Stet?” Tarb 
asked as a taxi took them back to 
the hotel in which most of the 
Times staff was domiciled. “If 
privacy doesn’t exist on Earth, 
it’s bound to keep occurring.” 

“Eh?” Stet took his attention 
away from her toes with some 
difficulty. “Some Earth people 
like privacy, too, but they have 



to fight for it. Violations aren’t 
legally punishable — that’s the 
only difference.” 

“Then surely the Terrestrials 
would understand about us, 
wouldn’t they?” she asked eag- 
erly. “If they knew how strongly 
we felt about privacy, maybe 
they wouldn’t violate it — not as 
much, anyway. I’m sure they’re 
not vicious, just ignorant. And 
you can’t just keep on getting 
Fizbians out of jail each time 
they run up against the problem. 
It would be too expensive, for 
one thing.” 

“Don’t worry,” he said, press- 
ing her toes. “I’ll take care of the 
whole thing.” 

“An article in the paper would- 
n’t really help much,” she per- 
sisted thoughtfully, “and I sup- 
pose you must have run at least 
one already. It would explain to 
the Fizbians that Terrestrials 
don’t regard invasion of privacy 
as a crime, but it wouldn’t tell 
the Terrestrials that Fizbians do. 
We’ll have to think of — ” 

“You’re surely not going to tell 
me how to run my paper on your 
first day here, are you?” 

He tried to take the sting out of 
his words by twining his toes 
around hers, but she felt guilty. 
She had been presumptuous. 
Probably there were lots of things 
she couldn’t understand yet — like 
why she shouldn’t polish her eye- 
balls in public. Stet had finally 



22 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



explained to her that, while Ter- 
restrial women did make up in 
public, they didn’t scour their 
irises, ever, and would be startled 
and horrified to see someone else 
doing so. 

“But I was horrified to see them 
raking their feathers in public!” 
Tarb had contended. 

“Combing their hair, my dear. 
And why - not? This is their 
planet.” 

That was always his answer. 7 
wonder, she speculated, whether 
he would expect a Terrestrial vis- 
itor to Fizbus to fly . because, 
after all, Fizbus is our planet. But 
she didn’t dare broach the ques- 
tion. 

However, if it was presumptu- 
ous of her to make helpful sug- 
gestions the first day, it was more 
than presumptuous of Stet to ask 
her up to his rooms to see his 
collection of rare early twentieth- 
century Terrestrial milk bottles 
and other antiques. So she just 
told him courteously that she was 
tired and wanted to go to roost. 
And, since the hotel had a whole 
section fitted up to suit Fizbian 
requirements, she spent a more 
comfortable night than she had 
expected. 

She awoke the next day full of 
enthusiasm and ready to start in 
on the great work at once. Al- 
though she might have been a 
little too forward the previous 
night, she knew, as she took a re- 



assuring glance in the mirror, that 
Stet would forgive her. 

TN the office, she was, at first, 
somewhat self-conscious about 
Drosmig, who hung insecurely 
from his perch muttering to him- 
self, but she soon forgot him in 
her preoccupation with duty. The 
first letter she picked up — al- 
though again oddly unlike the 
ones she’d read in the paper on 
Fizbus — seemed so simple that 
she felt she would have no diffi- 
culty in answering it all by her- 
self : 

Heidelberg 

Dear Senbot Drosmig: 

I am a professor of Fizbian 
History at a local university. 
Since my salary is a small one, 
owing to the small esteem in 
which the natives hold culture, I 
must economize wherever I can 
in order to make both ends meet. 
Accordingly, I do my own cook- 
ing and shop at the self-service 
supermarket around the corner, 
where I have found that prices 
are lower than in the service gro- 
ceries and the food no worse. 

However, the manager and a 
number of the customers have 
objected to my shopping with my 
feet. They don’t so much mind 
my taking packages off the 
shelves with them, but they have 
been quite vociferous on the sub- 
ject of my pinching the fruit with

my toes. Unripe fruit, however, 
makes me ill. What shall I do? 

Sincerely yours, 

Grez B’Groot 

Tarb dictated an unhesitating 
reply : 

Dear Professor B’Groot: 

Why don’t you explain to the 
manager of the store that Fiz- 
hians have wings and feet ra- 
ther than arms and hands? 

I’m sure his attitude and the 
attitudes of his customers will 
change when they learn that 
your pinching the fruit with 
your feet is not mere pedago- 
gical eccentricity, hut the reg- 
ular practice on our planet. 
Point out to him that your feet 
are covered and, therefore, 
more sanitary than the hare 
hands of his other customers. 

And always put on clean 
socks before you go shopping. 

Helpfully yours, 

Senbot Drosmig 

Miss Snow raised pale eye- 
brows. 

“Is something wrong?” Tarb 
asked anxiously. “Should I have 
put in that bit about work, study, 
meditate? It seems inappropriate 
somehow.” 

“Oh, no, not that. It’s just that 
your letter — well, violates Mr. 
Zarnon’s precept that, in Rome, 
one must do as the Romans do.” 



“But this isn’t Rome,” Tarb re- 
plied, bewildered. “It’s New 
York.” 

“He didn’t make the saying 
up,” Miss Snow replied testily. 
“It’s a Terrestrial proverb.” 
“Oh,” Tarb said. 

S HE resented this creature’s try- 
ing to tell her how to do her 
job. On the other hand, Tarb was 
wise enough to realize that Miss 
Snow, unpleasant though she 
might be, probably did know Stet 
well enough to be able to predict 
his reactions. 

So Tarb not only was reluctant 
to show Stet what she had already 
done, but hesitated about an- 
swering another and even more 
urgent letter that had just been 
brought in by special messenger. 
She tried to compromise by sub- 
mitting the letters to Drosmig — 
for, technically speaking, it was 
he who was her immediate su- 
perior — but he merely groaned, 
“Tell ’em all to drop dead,” from 
his perch and refused to open his 
eyes. 

In the end, Tarb had to take 
the letters to Stet’s office. Miss 
Snow trailed along behind her, 
uninvited. And, since this was a 
place of business, Tarb could not 
claim a privacy violation. Even 
if it weren’t a place of business, 
she remembered, she couldn’t — 
not here on Earth. Advanced 
spirituality, hah!

Advanced pain in the pinions! 
Stet read the first letter and 
her answer smilingly. “Excellent, 
Tarb — ” her hearts leaped — “for 
a first try, but I’d like to suggest 
a few changes, if I may.” 

“Well, of course,” she said, pre- 
tending not to notice the smirk 
on Miss Snow’s face. 

“Just write this Professor 
B’Goot that he should do his 
shopping at a grocery that offers 
service and practice his economies 
elsewhere. A professor, of all peo- 
ple, is expected to uphold the 
dignity of his own race — the idea, 
sneering at a culture that was 
thousands of years old when we 
were still building nests! Terres- 
trials couldn’t possibly haye any 
respect for him if they saw him 
prodding kumquats with his 
toes.” 

“It’s no sillier than writing 
with one’s vestigial wings!” Tarb 
blazed. 

“Well!” Miss Snow exclaimed 
in Terran. “Well, really !” 

Tarb started to stick out her 
tongue, then remembered. “I 
didn’t mean to offend you, Miss 
Snow. I know it’s your custom. 
But wouldn’t you understand if I 
typewrote with my feet?” 

Miss Snow tittered. 

“If you want the honest truth, 
hon, it would make you look like 
a feathered monkey.” 

“If you want the honest truth 
about what you look like to me, 



dearie — it’s a plucked chicken!” 
“Tarb, I think 'you should 
apologize to Miss Snow!” 

“All right!” Tarb stuck out her 
tongue. Miss Snow promptly 
thrust out hers in return. 

“Ladies, ladies!” Stet cried. “I 
think there has been a slight con- 
fusion of folkways!” He quickly 
changed the subject. “Is that an- 
other letter you have there, 
Tarb?” 

“Yes, but I didn’t try to answer 
it. I thought you’d better have a 
look at it first, since Miss Snow 
didn’t seem to think much of the 
job I did with the other one.” 
“Miss Snow always has the 
Times’ welfare at heart,” Stet re- 
marked ambiguously, and read : 

Chicago 

Dear Senbot Drosmig : 

I am employed as translator by 
the extraterrestrial division of 
Burns and Deerhart, Inc., the 
well-known interstellar mail-or- 
der house. As the company em- 
ploys no other Fizbians and our 
offices are situated in a small 
rural community where no others 
of our race reside, I find myself 
rather lonely. Moreover, being a 
bachelor, with neither chick nor 
child on Fizbus, I have nothing 
to look forward to upon my re- 
turn to the Home Planet some 
day. 

Accordingly, I decided to adopt 
a child to cheer my declining

years. I dispatched an interstel- 
largram to a reliable orphanage 
on Fizbus, outlining my hopes 
and requirements in some detail. 
After they had satisfied them- 
selves as to my income, strength 
of character, etc., they sent me a 
fatherless and motherless egg in 
cold storage, which I was sup- 
posed to hatch upon arrival. 

However, when the egg came 
to Earth, it was impounded by 
Customs. They say it is forbidden 
to import extrasolar eggs. I have 
tried to explain to them that it is 
not at all a question of importa- 
tion but of adoption; however, 
they cannot or will not under- 
stand. 

Please tell me what to do. I fear 
that they may not be keeping the 
egg at the correct Fizbian freezing 
point — which, as you know, is a 
good deal lower than Earth’s. 
The fledgling may hatch by itself 
and receive a traumatic shock 
that might very well damage its 
entire psyche permanently. 

Frantically yours, 

Glibmus Gluyt 

“Oh, for the stars’ sake!” Stet 
exploded. “This is really too 
much! Viz our consul, Miss Snow. 
That egg must go back to Fizbus 
at once, before any Terrestrials 
hear of it! And I must notify the 
government back on the Home 
Planet to keep a close check on all 
egg shipments. Something like 



this must certainly not occur 
again.” 

“Why shouldn’t the Terrestrials 
hear of it?” Tarb asked, outraged. 
“And I think it’s mean of you to 
send back a poor little orphan egg 
like that when it has a chance of 
getting a good home.” 

“An egg!” Miss Snow repeated 
incredulously. “You mean you 
really She gave me one 

mad little hoot of laughter and 
then stopped and strangled 
slightly. Her face turned purple 
in her efforts to restrain mirth. 
Really y Tarb thought, she looks so 
much better that color. 

S TET’S crest twitched violent- 
ly. “I hope — he began. “I do 
hope you will keep this . knowl- 
edge to yourself, Miss Snow.” 
“But of course, v she assured 
him, calming down. “I’m dread- 
fully sorry I was so rude. Nat- 
urally I wouldn’t dream of telling 
a soul, Mr. Zarnon. You can 
trust me.” 

“I’m sure I can, Miss Snow.” 
Tarb almost choked with in- 
dignation. “You mean you’ve 
been keeping the facts of our life 
from Terrestrials? As if they were 
fledglings . no, even fledglings 
are told these days.” 

“One could hardly blame him 
for it, Miss Morfatch,” Miss Snow 
said. “You wouldn’t want people 
to know that Fizbians laid eggs, 
would you?” 



26

“And why not?” 

“Tarb,” Stet intervened, “you 
don’t know what you’re talking 
about.” 

“Oh, don’t I? You’re ashamed 
of the fact that we bear our chil- 
dren in a clean, decent, honorable 
way instead of — ” She stopped. 
“I’m being as bad as you two are. 
Probably the Terrestrials’ way of 
reproduction doesn’t seem dirty 
to them — but, since they do re- 
produce that way, they could 
scarcely find our way objection- 
able!” 

“Tarb, that’s not how a young 
girl should talk!” 

“Oh, go lay an egg!” she said, 
knowing that she had overstepped 
the limits of propriety, but un- 
able to let him get away with 
that. “I hope to be a wife and 
mother some day,” she added, 
“and I only hope that when that 
time comes, I’ll be able to lay 
good eggs.” 

“Miss Morfatch,” Stet said, 
keeping control of his temper with 
a visible effort, “that will be 
enough from you. If common 
decency doesn’t restrain you, 
please remember that" I am your 
employer and that I set the poli- 
cies on my paper. You’ll do what 
you’re told and keep a civil 
tongue in your head or you’ll be 
sent back to Fizbus. Do I make 
myself clear?” 

“You do, indeed,” Tarb said. 
How could she ever have thought 



he was charming and handsome? 
Well, perhaps he still was hand- 
some, but fine feathers do not 
make fine deeds. And, if it came 
to that, it wasn’t his paper. 

“We have the same thing on 
Terra,” Miss Snow murmured 
sympathetically to Stet. “These 
young whippersnappers think 
they can start in running the 
paper the very first day. Why, 
Belinda Romney herself — she’s a 
distant cousin of mine, you know 
— told me — ” 

“Miss Snow,” Tarb said, “I 
hope for the sake of Earth that 
you are not a typical example of 
the Terrestrial species.” 

“And you, hon,” Miss Snow re- 
torted, “don’t belong on a paper, 
but in a chicken coop.” 

“Ladies!” Stet said helplessly. 
“Women,” he muttered, “certain- 
ly do not belong on a newspaper. 
Matter of fact, they don’t belong 
anywhere; their place is in the 
home only because there’s no- 
where else to put them.” 

Both females glared at him. 

T\URING the next fortnight, 
Tarb gained fluency in Ter- 
ran and also learned to operate 
a Terrestrial typewriter equipped 
with Fizbian type — mostly so that 
she could dispense with the serv- 
ices of the invaluable Miss Snow. 
She didn’t like typing, though — it 
chipped her toenails and her 
temper. Besides, Drosmig kept

complaining that the noise pre- 
vented him from sleeping and 
she preferred him to sleep rather 
than hang there making irrele- 
vant and, sometimes, unpleasant- 
ly relevant remarks. 

“Longing for the old scripto, 
eh?” one of the cameramen 
smiled as he lounged in the open 
doorway of her office. Although 
she was fond of fresh air, Tarb 
realized that she would have to 
keep the door shut from now on. 
Too many of the younger mem- 
bers of the staff kept booing at 
her as they passed, and now they 
had formed the habit of dropping 
in to offer her advice, encourage- 
ment and invitations to meals. At 
first, the attention had pleased 
her — but now she was much too 
busy to be bothered; she was go- 
ing to turn out acceptable answers 
to those letters or die trying. 

“Well, if the power can’t be 
converted, it can’t,” she said grim- 
ly. “Griblo, I do wish you’d be 
a dear and flutter off. I — ” 

He snorted. “Who says the 
power can’t be converted? Stet, 
huh?” 

She took her feet off the keys 
and looked at him. “Why do you 
say ‘Stet’ that way?” 

“Because that’s a lot of bird- 
seed he' gives you about not being 
able to convert Earth power. 
Could be done all right, but he 
and the consul have it all fixed 
up to keep Fizbian technology 



off the planet. Consul’s probably 
being paid off by the Internation- 
al Association of Manufacturers 
and Stet’s in it for the preserva- 
tion of indigenous culture — and 
maybe a little cash, too. After all, 
those rare antique collections of 
his cost money.” 

“I don’t believe it!” Tarb 
snapped. “Griblo, please — I have 
so much work to get through!” 

“Okay, chick, but I warn you, 
you’re going to have your bright- 
eyed illusions shattered. Why 
don’t you wake up to the truth 
about Stet? What you should do 
is maybe eschew the society of 
all journalists entirely, and a sor- 
did lot they are, and devote your- 
self to photographers — splendid 
fellows, all.” 

“Please shut the door behind 
you!” 

The door slammed. 

Tarb gazed disconsolately at 
the letter before her. Would she 
ever be able to answer letters to 
Stet’s satisfaction? The purpose 
of the whole column was service 
— but did she and Stet mean the 
same thing by the same word? 
Or, if they did, whom was Stet 
serving? 

She was paying too much at- 
tention to Griblo’s idle remarks. 
Obviously he was a sorehead — 
had some kind of grudge against 
Stet. Perhaps Stet was a bit too 
autocratic, perhaps he had even 
gone native to some extent, but 



28 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



you couldn’t say anything worse 
about him than that. All in all, 
he wasn’t a bad bird and she 
mustn’t let herself be influenced 
by rumormongers like Griblo. 

f |^ARB got up and took the let- 
ter to Stet. He was in his office 
dictating to Miss Snow. After all, 
Tarb could not repress the ugly 
thought, why should he care 
about the scriptos? He’ll never 
have to use a typewriter. 

And he was perfectly nice about 
being interrupted. The only thing 
he didn’t like was being contra- 
dicted. I’m getting bitter, she 
told herself in surprise. And at 
my age, too. I wonder what I’ll 
be like when I'm old. 

This thought alarmed her and 
so she smiled very sweetly at Stet 
as she murmured, “Would you 
mind reading this?” and gave him 
the letter. 

“Run into another little snag, 
eh?” he said affably, giving her 
foot a gentle pat with his. “Well, 
let’s see what we can do about it.” 

Montreal 

Dear Senbot Drosmig: 

I am a chef at the Cafe Inter- 
stellaire, which, as everyone 
knows, is one of the most chic 
eating establishments on this not 
very chic planet. During my spare 
moments, I am a great amateur of 
the local form of entertainment 
known as television. I am espe- 



cially fascinated by the native 
actress Ingeborg Swedenborg, 
who, in spite of being a Terr an, 
compares most favorably with 
our own Fizbian footlight favor- 
ites. 

The other day, while I am in 
the kitchen engaged in preparing 
the ragout celeste a la fizbe for 
which I am justly celebrated on 
nine planets, I hear a stir outside 
in the dining room. I strain my 
ears. I hear the cry, “ It is Inge- 
borg Swedenborg!” 

I cannot help myself. I rush to 
the doorway. There, behold, the 
incomparable Ingeborg herself! 
She follows the headwaiter to a 
choice table. She is even more 
ravishing in real life than on the 
screen. On her, it does not matter 
that she has no feathers save on 
the head — even skin looks good. 
Overcome by involuntary ardor, 
I boo at her. Whereupon I am 
violently assailed by a powerfully 
built native whom I have not 
previously noticed to be escorting 
her. 

I am rescued before he can do 
me any permanent damage, 
though, if you wish the truth, it 
will be a long time before I can 
fly again. However, I am given 
notice by the cold-hearted man- 
agement. Now I am without a 
job. And what is more, if on this 
planet one is not permitted to ex- 
press one’s instinctive and natural 
admiration for a beautiful wo-

man, then all I have to say is 
that it is a lousy planet and I 
wiggle my toes at it. How do I go 
about getting deported? 

Impatiently yours, 

Rajois Sludd 

I suppose it serves him 
right,” Tarb said quickly, 
before Stet could comment, “but 
don’t you think it would be a 
good idea if the Times got up a 
Fizbian-Terrestrial ha dbook of 
its own? It’s the only solution 
that I can see. The regular one, 
I recognize now, is more than in- 
adequate, with all that spiritual 
gup — ” Miss Snow drew in her 
breath sharply — “and not much 
else. All these problems are bound 
to arise again and again. Frankly 
speaking, Stet, your solutions 
only take care of the individual 
cases; they don’t establish . a 
sound intercultural basis.” 

He grunted. 

“What’s more,” she went on 
eagerly, “we could not only give 
copies to every Fizbian planning 
to visit Earth, but also print 
copies in Terran for Terrestrials 
who are interested in learning 
more about Fizbus and the Fiz- 
bians. In fact, all Terrans who 
come in contact with us should 
have the book. It would help both 
races to understand each other so 
much better and — ” 

“Unnecessary!” Stet snapped, 
so violently that she stopped with 



her mouth open. “The standard 
handbook is more than adequate. 
Whatever limitations it may have 
are deliberate. Setting down in 
cold print all that . stuff you 
want to have included would 
make a point of things we prefer 
not to stress. I wouldn’t want to 
have the Terrestrials humor me 
as if I were a fledgling or a 
foreigner.” 

He leaped out of his chair and 
paced up and down the office. 
One would think he had forgot- 
ten he ever could fly. 

“But you are a foreigner, Stet,” 
Tarb said gently. “No matter 
what you do or say, Terrestrials 
and Fizbians are — well, worlds 
apart.” 

“Spiritually, I am much closer 
to the Terrestrials than — but you 
wouldn’t understand.” He and 
Miss Snow nodded sympathetic- 
ally at each other. “And you 
might be interested to know that 
I happen to be the author of all 
that ‘spiritual gup.’ I wrote the 
handbook — as a service to Fizbus, 
I might point out. I wasn’t paid 
for it.” 

“Oh, dear!” Tarb said. “Oh, 
dear! I really and truly am sorry, 
Stet.” 

H E brushed her apologies aside. 

“Answer that letter. Ignore 
the question about deportation 
entirely.” He ran a foot through 
his crest. “Just tell the fellow to 



30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



see our personnel manager. We 
could use a chef in the company 
dining room. Haven’t tasted a de- 
cent celestial ragout — at a price I 
could afford — since I left Fizbus.” 

“Would you want me to print 
that reply in the column?” she 
asked. “ ‘If you lose your job be- 
cause you’re unfamiliar with Ter- 
restrial customs, come to the 
Times. We’ll give you another 
job at a much lower salary.’ ” 

“Of course not! Send your an- 
swer directly to him. You don’t 
think we put any of those letters 
you’ve been answering in the col- 
umn, do you? Or any that come 
in at all, for that matter. I have 
to write all the letters that are 
printed — and answer them my- 
self.” 

“I should have recognized the 
style,” Tarb said. “So this is the 
service the Times offers to its 
subscribers. Nothing that would 
be of help. Nothing that could 
prevent other Fizbians from mak- 
ing the same mistake. Nothing 
that could be controversial. Noth- 
ing that would help Terrestrials 
to understand us. Nothing, in 
short, but a lot of birdseed!” 

“Impertinence!” Miss Snow re- 
marked. “You shouldn’t let her 
talk to you like that, Mr. Zar- 
non.” 

“Tarb!” Stet roared, casting an 
impatient glance at Miss Snow. 
“How dare you talk to me in 
that way? And all this is none of 



your business, anyway.” 

“I’m a Fizbian,” she stated, 
“and it certainly is my business. 
I’m not ashamed of having wings. 
I’m proud of them and sorry for 
people who don’t have them. And, 
by the stars, I’m going to fly. If 
skirts are improper to wear for 
flying, then I can wear slacks. I 
saw them in a Terrestrial fashion 
magazine and they’re perfectly 
respectable.” 

“Not for working hours,” Miss 
Snow sniffed. 

“I have no intention of flying 
during working hours,” Tarb 
snapped back. “Even you should 
be able to see that the ceiling’s 
much too low.” 

Stet ran a foot through his 
crest again. “I hate to say this, 
Tarb, but I don’t feel you’re the 
right person for this job. You 
mean well, I’m sure, but you’re 
too — too inflexible.” 

“You mean I have principles,” 
she retorted, “and you don’t.” 
Which wasn’t entirely true; he 
had principles — it was just that 
they were unprincipled. 

“That will be enough, Tarb,” 
he said sternly. “You’d better go 
now while I think this over. I’d 
hate to send you back to Fizbus, 
because I’d — well, I’d miss you. 
On the other hand . .” 

Tarb went back to her office 
and drafted a long interstel to a 
cousin on Fizbus, explaining what 
she would like for a birthday

present. “And send it special de- 
livery,” she concluded, “because 
I am having an urgent and early 
birthday.” 

“JT'ARB Morfatch!” Stet howl- 
-*■ ed, a few months later. 
“What on Earth are you doing?” 
“Dictating into my scripto,” 
Tarb said cheerfully. “Some of 
the boys from the print shop 
helped fix it up for me. They were 
very nice about it, too, consider- 
ing that the superscriptos will 
probably throw them out of work. 
You know, Stet, Terrestrials can 
be quit§ decent people.” 

“Where did you get that 
scripto?” 

“Cousin Mylfis sent it to me 
for my birthday. I must have 
complained about wearing out my 
claws on a typewriter and he 
didn’t understand that scriptos 
won’t work on Earth. Only they 
do.” She beamed at her em- 
ployer. “All it needed was a 
transformer. I guess you’re just 
not mechanically minded, Stet.” 
He clenched his feet. “Tarb, 
Terrestrials aren’t ready for our 
technology. You’ve done a very 
unwise thing in having that 
scripto sent to you. And I’ve done 
a very unwise thing in keeping 
you here against my better judg- 
ment.” 

“Maybe the Terrestrials aren’t 
ready,” she said, ignoring his last 
remark,, “but I’m not going t6 



wear my feet to the bone if I can 
get a gadget that’ll do the same 
thing with no expenditure of 
physical energy.” She placed a 
foot on his. “I don’t see how a 
thing like this could possibly cor- 
rupt the Terrestrials, Stet. It’s 
made a better, brighter girl out 
of me already.” 

“Hear, hear!” said Drosmig 
hoarsely from his perch. 

“Shut up, Senbot. You just 
don’t understand, Tarb. If you’ll 
only — ” 

“But I’m afraid I do under- 
stand, Stet. And I won’-t send my 
scripto back.” 

“May I come in?” Miss Snow 
tapped lightly on the door frame. 
“Is what I hear true?” 

“About the scripto?” Tarb ask- 
ed. “It certainly is. All you have 
to do is talk into it and the words 
appear on the paper. Guess that 
makes you obsolete, doesn’t it. 
Miss Snow?” 

“And high time, too,” com- 
mented Drosmig. “Never liked 
the old biddy.” 

“Senbot . .” Stet began, and 
stopped. “Oh, what’s the use try- 
ing to talk reasonably to either 
of you! Tarb, come back to my 
office with me.” 

She could not refuse and so 
she followed. Miss Snow, torn be- 
tween curiosity and the scripto, 
hesitated and then made after 
them. 

“I’ve decided to take you off 



32 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the column — for this morning, 
anyway — and send you on an 
outside assignment,” Stet told 
Tarb. “The consul’s wife is com- 
ing to Earth today. Once she 
heard there was another woman 
on Terra, nothing could stop her. 
Consul seems to think it’s my 
fault, too,” he added moodily. 
“Won’t believe I had nothing to 
do with hiring you. I told the 
Home Office not to send a wo- 
man, that she’d disrupt the office, 
and you sure as hell have.” 

“But I thought you said in 
your letters that you were doing 
everything in your power to bring 
Fizbian womenfolk to their men 
on Terra!” Tarb pointed out 
malevolently. 

Y ES,” he confessed. “We must 
please our readers. You know 
that. Anyway, all that’s irrele- 
vant right now. What I want 
you to do is go meet the consul’s 
wife. Nice touch, having the only 
other Fizbian woman here be the 
one to interview her. Human in- 
terest angle for the Terrestrial 
papers. Shouldn’t be surprised if 
Solar Press picked it up — they 
like items of that kind for fillers. 
Take Griblo along with you and 
make sure he has film in his 
camera this time.” 

“Yes, sir,” Tarb said. “Any- 
thing you say, sir.” 

He pretended not to notice her 
sarcasm. “I have a list of the 



questions you should ask her.” 
He fixed her with his eye. “You 
stick to them, do you hear me? 
I don’t want anything contro- 
versial.” He rummaged among 
the papers on his desk. “I know 
I had it half an hour ago. Sit 
down, will you, Tarb? Stop hop- 
ping around.” 

“If I can’t have a perch, I want 
a stool,” Tarb said. “This is a 
private office and I think it’s a 
gross affectation for you to have 
those silly, uncomfortable chairs 
in it.” 

“If you would have your wings 
clipped like Mr. Zarnon’s — ” Miss 
Snow began before Stet could 
stop her. 

“Stet, you didn't'.” 

His crest thrashed back and 
forth. “They’ll grow back again 
and it’s so much more convenient 
this way. After all, I can’t use 
them here and I do have to asso- 
ciate with Terrestrials and use 
their equipment. The consul has 
had his wings clipped also and 
so have several of our more 
prominent industrialists — ” 

“Oh, Stet'." Tarb wailed. “I

pretty hard things about you, but 
I wouldn’t ever have dreamed

“Why should I have to apolo- 
gize to you?” he raged. “Who do 
you think you are, anyway? 
You’re an incompetent little fool.

I should have fired you that first 
day. I’ve let you get away with 
so much only because you have 
a pretty face. You’ve only been 
on Earth a couple of months; 
how can you presume to think 
you know what’s good and what’s 
bad for the Fizbians here?” 

“I may not know what’s good,” 
she retorted, “but I certainly do 
know what’s bad. And that’s you, 
Stet — you and everything you 
stand for. You not only don’t 
have the courage of your con- 
victions, you don’t even have any 
convictions. You’re ashamed of 
being a Fizbian, ashamed of any- 
thing that makes Fizbians differ- 
ent from Terrestrials, even if it’s 
something better, something that 
most Terrans would like to have. 
You’re a damned hypocrite, Stet 
Zarnon, that’s what you are — 
professing to help our people 
when actually you’re hurting 
them by trying to force them into 
the mold of an alien species.” 

She brushed back her crest. “I 
take it I’m fired,” she said more 
quietly. “Do you want me to in- 
terview the consul’s wife first or 
leave right away?” 

It took Stet a moment to bring 
his voice under control. “Inter- 
view her first. We’ll talk this 
over when you get back.” 

I T was pleasant to be away 
from the office, she thought as 
the taxi pulled toward the air- 



field, and doing wingwork again, 
even if it proved to be the first 
and last time on this planet. 
Griblo sat hunched in a corner 
of the seat, too preoccupied with 
the camera, which, even after two 
years, he hadn’t fully mastered, 
to pay attention to her. 

Outside, it was raining, the 
kind of thin drizzle that, on Fiz- 
bus or Earth, could go on for 
days. Tarb had brought along 
the native umbrella she had pur- 
chased in the hotel gift shop — a 
delightful contraption that was 
supposed to keep off the rain and 
didn’t, and was supposed to col- 
lapse and did, but at the wrong 
moments. She planned to take it 
back with her when she returned 
to Fizbus. Approved souvenir or 
not, it was the same beautiful 
purple as her eyes. And, besides, 
who had made the ruling about 
approved souvenirs? Stet, of 
course. 

“No reason why we couldn’t 
have autofax brought from 
Home,” Griblo suddenly grum- 
bled. 

Tarb pulled herself back from 
her thoughts. “I suppose Stet 
wouldn’t let you,” she said. “But 
now that one scripto’s here,” she 
went on somewhat complacently, 
“he’ll have to — ” 

“Keep this planet charming and 
unspoiled, he says,” Griblo inter- 
rupted ungratefully. “Its spiritual 
values will be corrupted by too

much contact with a crass ad- 
vanced technology. And, of 
course, he’s got the local camera 
manufacturers solidly behind him. 
I wonder whether they advertise 
in the Times because he helps 
keep autofax off Terra or whether 
he keeps the autofax off Terra 
because they advertise in the 
Time s.” 

“But what does he care about 
advertising? He may talk as if 
he owned the Times, but he 
doesn’t.” 

Griblo gave a nasty laugh. “No, 
he doesn’t, but if the Terran edi- 
tion didn’t show a profit, it’d 
fold quicker than you can flip 
your wings and he’d have to go 
back to nasty old up-to-date 
Fizbus as a lowly sub-editor. And 
he wouldn’t like that one bit. 
Our Stet, as you may have no- 
ticed, is fond of running things 
to suit himself.” 

“But Mr. Grupe told me that 
the Times isn’t interested in 
money. It’s running this edition 
of the paper only as a service to 
— oh, I suppose all that was a 
lot of birdseed, too!” 

“Grupe!” Griblo snorted. “The 
sanctimonious old buzzard! He’s 
a big stockholder on the paper. 
Bet you didn’t know that, did 
you? All they’re out for is money. 
Fizbian money, Terrestrial money 
— so long as it’s cash.” 

“Tell me, Griblo,” Tarb asked, 
“what does ‘When in Rome, do as 



the Romans do’ mean?” 

Griblo grinned sOurly. “Stet’s 
favorite motto.” He moved along 
the seat closer to her. “I’ll tell you 
what it means, chicken. When on 
Earth, don’t be a Fizbian.” 

f'F'HE consul’s wife, an old 
mauve creature, did not seem 
overpleased to see Tarb, since the 
younger, prettier Fizbian definite- 
ly took the spotlight away from 
her. The press had, of course, 
seen Tarb before, but at that time 
they hadn’t been able to com- 
municate directly with her and 
they didn’t, she now found out, 
think nearly as much of Stet as 
he did of them. 

Tarb couldn’t attempt to de- 
viate much from Stet’s questions, 
for the consul’s wife was not very 
cooperative and the consul him- 
self watched both women narrow- 
ly. He was a good friend of Stet’s, 
Tarb knew, and apparently Stet 
had taken the other man into his 
confidence. 

When the interviews were over 
and the consular party had left, 
Tarb remained to chat with the 
Terrestrial journalists. Despite 
Griblo’s worried objections, she 
joined them in the Moonfield 
Restaurant, where she daringly 
partook of a cup of coffee and 
then another and another. 

After that, things weren’t very 
clear. She dimly remembered the 
other reporters assuring her that

she shouldn’t disfigure her lovely 
wings with a stole . and then 
pirouetting in the air over the bar 
to prolonged applause . and 
then she was in the taxi again 
with Griblo shaking her. 

“Wake up, Tarb — we’re almost 
at the office! Stet’ll have me 
plucked for this!” 

Tarb sat up and pushed her 
crest out of her eyes. The sky was 
growing dark. They must have 
been gone a long time. 

“I’ll never hear the end of 
this,” Griblo moaned. “Why, if 
only he could get someone to fill 



my place, Stet would fire me like 
a shot! Not that I wouldn’t quit 
if I could get another job.” 

“Oh, it’ll be mostly me he’ll be 
mad at.” Tarb pulled out her 
compact. Stet had warned her 
not to polish her eyeballs in pub- 
lic, but the ground with him! Her 
head hurt. And her feathers, she 
saw in the mirror, had turned al- 
most beige. She looked horrible. 
She felt horrible. And Stet would 
probably think she was horrible. 

“When Stet’s mad,” Griblo 
prophesied darkly, “he’s mad at 
everybody !” _ - 



36 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




And Stet was mad. He was 
waiting in the newsroom, his em- 
erald-blue eyes blazing as if he 
had not only polished but lac- 
quered them. 

“‘'WTHAT’S the idea of taking 
” six hours to cover a simple 
story!” he shouted as soon as the 
door began to open. “Aside from 
the trivial matter of a deadline to 
be met — Griblo, where’s T arb? 
Nothing’s happened to her, has 
it?” 

“Naaah,” Griblo said, unsling- 
ing his’ camera. “She took a short 



cut, only she got held up by a 
terrace. Shagged her umbrella on 
it, I believe. I heard her yelling 
when I was waiting for the ele- 
vator; I didn’t know nice girls 
knew language like that. She 
should be up any minute now . 
There she is.” 

He pointed to a window, 
through which the lissome form 
of the young feature writer could 
be seen, tapping on the glass in 
order to attract attention. 

“Somebody better open it for 
her,” the cameraman suggested. 
“Probably not meant to open

from the outside. Not many peo- 
ple come in that way, I guess.” 

O PEN-MOUTHED, the whole 
newsroom stared at the win- 
dow. Finally the Copy Editor got 
up and let a dripping Tarb in. 

“Nearly thought I wouldn’t 
make it,” she observed, shaking 
herself in a flurry of wet pink 
feathers. The rest of the staff 
ducked, most of them too late. 
“Umbrella didn’t do much good,” 
she continued, closing it. It left 
a little puddle on the rug. “My 
wings got soaked right away.” 
She tossed her wet crest out of her 
eyes. “Golly, but it’s good to fly 
again. Haven’t done it for months, 
but it seems like years.” Her eye 
caught Miss Snow’s. “You don’t 
know what you’re missing!” 
“Tarb,” Stet thundered, “you’ve 
been drinking coffee! Griblol” 
But the cameraman had nimbly 
sought sanctuary in the dark- 
room. 

“You’d better go home, Tarb.” 
When Stet’s eye tufts met across 
his nose, he was downright ugly, 
she realized. “Griblo can give me 
the dope and I’ll write up the 
story myself. I can fill it out with 
canned copy. And you and I will 
discuss this situation in the 
morning.” 

“Won’t go home when there’s 
work to be done. Duty calls me.” 
Giving a brief and quite recog- 
nizable imitation of a Terrestrial 



trumpet, Tarb stalked down the 
corridor to her office. 

Drosmig looked up from his 
perch, to which he was still 
miraculously clinging at that 
hour. “So it got you, too? . 
Sorry . nice girl.” 

“It hasn’t got me,” Tarb re- 
plied, picking up a letter marked 
Urgent. “I’ve got it.” She scanned 
the letter, then made hastily for 
Stet’s office. 

He sat drumming on his desk 
with the antique stainless steel 
spatula he used as a paperknife. 

“Read this!” she demanded, 
thrusting the letter into his face. 
“Read this, you traitor — sacri- 
ficing our whole civilization to 
what’s most expedient for you! 
Hypocrite! Cad!” 

“Tarb, listen to me! I’m — ” 
“Read it!” She slapped the 
letter down in front of him. 
“Read it and see what you’ve 
done to us! Sure, we Fizbians 
keep to ourselves and so the only 
people who know anything about 
us are the ones who want to sell 
us brushes, while the people who 
want to help us don’t know a 
damn thing about us and — ” 

“Oh, all right! I’ll read it if 
you’ll only keep quiet!” He 
turned the letter right-side up.

Dear Senbot Drosmig: 

I represent the Dzoglian Pub- 
lishing Company, Inc., of which

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I know you have heard, since 
your paper has seen fit to give 
our books some of the most un- 
just reviews on record. However, 
be that as it may, I have opened 
an office on Earth with the laud- 
able purpose of effecting an in- 
terchange of respective litera- 
tures, to see which Terrestrial 
books might most profitably be 
translated into Fizbian, and 
which of the authors on our own 
list might have potential appeal 
for the Earth reader. 

Dealing with authors is, of 
course, a nerve-racking business 
and I soon found myself in dire 
need of mental treatment. What 
was my horror to find that this 
primitive, although charming, 
planet had no neurotones, no psy- 
choscopes, not even any cerebro- 
phones — in fact, no psychiatric 
machines at all! The very knowl- 
edge of this brought me several 
degrees closer to a breakdown. 

Perhaps I should have consult- 
ed you at this juncture, but I ad- 
mit I was a bit of a snob. “What 
sort of advice can a mere journal- 
ist give me,” I thought, “that I 
could not give myself?” So, more 
for amusement than anything 
else, I determined to consult a 
native practitioner. “After all,” I 
said to myself, “a good laugh is 
a step forward on the road to 
recovery.” 

Accordingly, I went to see this 
native fellow. They work entirely 



without machines, I understand, 
using something like witchcraft. 
At the same time, I thought I 
might pick up some material for 
a jolly little book on primitive 
customs which I could get some 
unknown writer to throw together 
inexpensively. Strong human in- 
terest items like that always have 
great reader-appeal. 

The native chap — doctor, he 
calls himself — was most cordial, 
which he should have been at the 
price I was paying him. One thing 
I must say about these natives — 
backward they may be, but they 
have a very shrewd commercial 
sense. You can’t even imagine the 
trouble I had getting those au- 
thors to sign even remotely rea- 
sonable contracts . which in 
part accounts tor my mental dis- 
turbance, I suppose. 

Well, anyway, I handed the 
native a privacy waiver care- 
fully filled out in Terran. He took 
it, smiled and said, “We’ll discuss 
this afterward. My contact lenses 
have disappeared; I suppose one 
of my patients has stolen them 
again. Can’t see a thing without 
them.” 

So we sat down and had a bit 
of a chat. He seemed remarkably 
intelligent for a native; never in- 
terrupted me once. 

“You are definitely in great 
trouble,” he told me when I’d 
finished. “You need to be psycho- 
analyzed.”

“Good, good,” I said. “I see 
I’ve come to the right shop.” 
“Now just lie down and make 
yourself comfortable.” 

“Lie down?” I repeated, puz- 
zled. I have an excellent com- 
mand of Terr an, but every now 
and then an idiom will throw 
me. “I tell the truth, sir, and 
when I am required by force of 
circumstances to lie, I lie up.” 
“No,” he said, “not that kind 
of lying. You know, the kind you 
do at night when you go to sleep.” 
“Oh, I get you," I said idio- 
matically. Without further ado, 
I flung off my ulster and flew up 
to a thingummy hanging from 
the ceiling — chandelier, I believe, 
is the native term — flipped upside 
down, and hung from it by my 
toes. Wasn’t the Presidential 
Perch, by any means, but it 
wasn’t bad at all. “What do I 
do next?” I inquired affably. 

“My dear fellow,” the chap 
said, whipping out a notebook 
from the recesses of his costume, 
“how long have you had this de- 
lusion that you are a bird — or is 
it a bat?” 

“Sir,” I said as haughtily as my 
position permitted, “/ am neither 
a bird nor a bat. I am a Fizbian. 
Surely you have heard of Fiz- 
bians?” 

“yes, yes, of course. They come 
from another country or planet 
or something. Frankly, politics 
is a bit outside my sphere. All 



I’m interested in is people — and 
Fizbians are people, aren’t they?” 

“Yes, certainly. If anything, it’s 
you who . Yes, they are peo- 
ple.” 

“Well, tell me then, Mr. Liznig, 
when was it you first started 
thinking you were a bat or a 
bird?” 

I tried to control myself. “I 
am neither a bird nor a bat! I 
am a Fizbian! I have wings! 
See?” I fluttered them. 

He peered at me. “I wish I 
could,” he said regretfully. “With- 
out my glasses, though, I’m as 
blind as a bat — or a bird.” 

Well, the long and the short of 
it is that the natives are planning 
to certify me as insane and in- 
carcerate me, pending the doc- 
tor’s decision as to whether my 
delusion is that I am a bird or 
a bat. They are using my privacy 
waiver as commitment papers. 

Save me, Senbot Drosmig, for I 
feel that if I have to wait for the 
doctor’s glasses to be delivered, 
I shall indeed go mad. 

Distractedly yours, 

Tgos Liznig 

I ’LL handle this myself,” Stet 
said crisply. “I’ll tell the con- 
sul to advise the Terran State 
Department that this man should 
be deported as an undesirable 
alien. That’ll solve the problem 
neatly. We can’t have this con-

“But aren’t you going to ex- 
plain to them that he’s perfectly 
sane?” Tarb gasped. 

“No need to bother. He’ll be 
grateful enough to get off the 
planet. Besides, how do I know 
he is perfectly sane?” 

“Stet Zarnon, you’re perfectly 
horrid!” 

“And you, Tarb Morfatch, are 
disgustingly drunk. Now you go 
right home and sleep it off. I 
know I was too harsh with you — 
my fault for letting you go out 
alone with Griblo in the first 
place when you’ve been here only 
a few months. Might have known 
those Terran journalists would 
lead you astray. Nice fellows, but 
irresponsible.” He flicked out his 
tongue. “There, I’ve apologized. 
Now will you go home?” 
“Home!” Tarb shrieked. “Home 
when there’s work to be done 
and — ” 

“ — and you’re not going to be 
the one to do it. Tarb,” he said, 
attempting to seize her foot, 
which she pulled away, “I was 
going to tell you tomorrow, but 
you might as well know tonight. 
I’ve taken you off the column for 
good. I have a better job for you.” 
She looked at him. “A better 
job? Are you being sarcastic? 
What as?” 

“As my wife.” He got up and 
came over to her. She stood still, 
almost stunned. “That solves the 



whole problem tidily. An office is 
no place for you, darling — you’re 
really a simple home-girl at 
heart. Newspaper work is too 
strenuous for you; it upsets you 
and makes you nervous and irrit- 
able. I want you to stay home 
and take care of our house and 
hatch our eggs- — unostentatiously, 
of course.” 

“Why, you — ” she spluttered. 

He put his foot over her mouth. 
“Don’t give me your answer now. 
You’re in no condition to think. 
Tell me tomorrow.” 

TT rained all night and con- 
-*■ tinued on into the morning. 
Tarb’s head ached, but she had 
to make an appearance at the 
office. First she vizzed an ac- 
quaintance she had made the day 
before; then she took her um- 
brella and set forth. 

As she kicked open the door to 
the newsroom, all sound ceased. 
Voices stopped abruptly. Type- 
writers halted in mid-click. Even 
the roar of the presses downstairs 
suddenly seemed to mute. Every 
head turned to look at Tarb. 

Humph, she thought, removing 
her plastic oversocks, so suppose 
I was a little oblique yesterday. 
They needn’t stare at me. They 
never stare at Drosmig. Just be- 
cause I’m a woman, I suppose! 
The gate crashed loudly behind 
her. 

“Oh, Miss Morfatch,” Miss

41 



Snow called. “Mr. Zarnon said he 
wanted to see you as soon as you 
came in. It’s urgent.” And she 
giggled. 

“Really?” Tarb said. “Well, 
he’ll just have to wait until I’ve 
wrung out my wings.” Sooner or 
later, she would have to face Stet, 
but she wanted to put it off as 
long as possible. 

She opened the door to her 
office and halted in amazement. 
For, seated on a stool behind the 
desk, haggard but vertical, was 
Senbot Drosmig, busily reading 
letters and blue-penciling com- 
ments on them with his feet. 

“Good morning, my dear,” he 
said, giving her a wan smile. 
“Surprised to see me functioning 
again, eh?” 

“Well — yes.” She opened her 
dripping umbrella mechanically 
and stood it in a corner. “How — ” 
“I realized last night that all 
that happened to you was my 
fault. You were my responsibility 
and I failed you.” 

“Oh, don’t be melodramatic, 
Senbot. I wasn’t your responsi- 
bility and you didn’t fail me. Not 
that I’m not glad to see you up 
and doing again, but — ” 

“But I did fail you!” the aged 
journalist insisted. “And, in the 
same way, I failed my people. I 
shouldn’t have given in. I should 
have fought Zarnon as you, my 
dear, tried to do. But it isn’t too 
late!” The fire of the crusader 



lit up in his watery old eyes. “I 
can still fight him and his sacred 
crows — his Earthlings! If I have 
to, I can go over his head to 
Grupe. Grupe may not under- 
stand Stet’s moral failings, but 
he certainly will comprehend his 
commercial ones. Grupe owns 
stock in other Fizbian enterprises 
besides the Times. Autofax, for 
example.” 

“Oh, Senbot!” Tarb wailed. 
“The whole thing’s such an awful 
mess!” 

“T DON’T think it’ll be neces- 
sary to threaten that far,” he 
comforted her. “Stet is no fool. 
He knows which side of his 
breadnut is peeled.” 

“I’m sure you’ll do a wonder- 
ful job,” she exclaimed, impul- 
sively giving a ritual entrechat. 
“And I wish I could stay and 
help you, but . .” 

“I know, my dear.” 

“You do?” She was puzzled. 
“But how did the news get 
around so quickly?” 

He shrugged. “The Terrestrial 
grapevine is almost as efficient as 
the Fizbian. Didn’t you notice 
any change in the — ah — atmos- 
phere when you came in?” 

“Oh, was that the reason?” 
Tarb laughed merrily. “Some- 
how it never occurred to me that 
they could have heard so soon.” 
“But the morning editions have 
been out for hours.”

FT^HE door to the office was 
flung open. Stet stormed in, 
bristling with a most unlover- 
like rage. 

“Miss Morfatch — ” he waved 
a crumpled copy of the Terres- 
trial Tribune at her — “when I 
give an order, I expect to be 
obeyed! Didn’t Miss Snow tell 
you to report directly to my of- 
fice the instant you came in? 
Although that’s a question I 
don’t have to ask; I know Miss 
Snow, at least, is someone I can 
trust.” 

“I was coming to see you, 
Stet,” Tarb said soothingly. 
“Right away.” 

“Oh, you were, were you? And 
have you seen this?” Stet fairly 
threw the paper at her. Smack in 
the middle of the front page was 
a picture of herself in full flight 
over the airfield bar. Not a very 
good picture, but what could you 
expect with Terrestrial equip- 
ment? When the autofax came, 
perhaps she would be done jus- 
tice.

“I feel that you Terrans and we

lovely Tarb Morfatch, Fizbus Times 



feature writer, told her fellow-re- 
porters yesterday at the Moonfield 
Restaurant, “if we learn to under- 
stand each other’s differences as 
well as appreciate our similarities. 

“With commerce between the two 
planets expanding as rapidly as it 
has been,” Miss Morfatch went on, 
“it becomes increasingly important 
that we make sure there is no clash 
of mores between us. Where adap- 
tation is impossible, we must both 
adjust. ‘When in Rome, do as the 
Romans do’ is an outmoded con- 
cept in the complex interstellar 
civilization of today. The Romans 
must learn to accept us as we are, 
and vice versa. 

“Forgive me if I’ve offended you 
by my frankness,” she said, sticking 
out her tongue in the charming ges- 
ture of apology that is acquiring 
such a vogue on Earth, Belinda 
Romney and many other socialites 
having enthusiastically adopted it, 
“but you’ve violated our privacy so

— “did I say all that while I was 
caffeinated? I ought to turn out 
some pretty terrific copy sober.” 
“And to think you, the woman 
I had asked to make my wife, 
did this to me.” 

“Oh, that’s all right, Stet,” 
Tarb said without looking up 
from the paper. “I wasn’t going 
to accept you, anyway.” 

“Good for you, Tarb,” Dros- 
mig approved. 

“You’re going back to Fizbus 
on the next liner — do you hear 
me?” Stet raged. 

S HE smiled sunnily. “Oh, but 
I’m not, Stet. I’m going to 
stay right here on Earth. I like 
it. You might say the spiritual 
aura got me.” 

He snorted. “How can you pos- 
sibly stay? You don’t have an 
independent income and this is 
an expensive planet. Besides, I 
won’t let you stay on Earth. I 
have considerable influence, you 
know!” 

“Poor Stet.” She smiled at him 
again. “I’m afraid the Fizbian 
press — the Fizbian consul even — 
are pretty small pullets beside 
the Solar Press Syndicate. You 
see, I came in this morning only 
to resign.” 

He stared at her. 

“Yesterday,” she informed him, 
“I was offered another position 
— as feature writer for the SP. I 
hadn’t decided whether or not 



to accept when I reported back 
last evening, but you made up 
my mind for me, so I called them 
this morning and took the job. 
My work will be to explain Fiz- 
bians to Terrans and Terrans to 
Fizbians — as I wanted to do for 
the Times, Stet, only you would- 
n’t let me.” 

“It’s no use saying anything to 
you about loyalty, I suppose?” 
“None whatsoever,” she said. 
“I owe the Times no loyalty and 
I’m doing what I do out of loy- 
alty to Fizbus . plus, of course, 
a much higher salary.” 

“I’m glad for you, Tarb,” 
Drosmig said sincerely. 

“Be glad for yourself, Senbot, 
because Stet will have to let you 
conduct the column your way 
from now on. Either it’ll supple- 
ment my work in the Terrestrial 
papers or he’ll look like a fool. 
And you do hate looking like a 
fool, don’t you, Stet?” 

He didn’t answer. 

“Better give up, Stet.” She 
turned to Drosmig. “Well, good- 
by, Senbot — or, rather, so long. 
I’m sure we’ll be seeing each 
other again. Good-by, Stet. No 
hard feelings, I hope?” 

He neither moved nor spoke. 
“Well . good-by, then,” she 
said. 

The door closed. Stet stared 
after her. The forgotten umbrella 
dripped forlornly in the corner.

The Cave of Night 



T HE phrase was first used 
by a poet disguised in the 
cynical hide of a newspaper 
reporter. It appeared on the first 
day and was widely reprinted. 
He wrote: 

“At eight o'clock, after the Sun 
has set and the sky is darkening, 
look up! There's a man up there 
where no man has ever been. 

“He is lost in the cave of 
night . .” 

The headlines demanded some- 
thing short, vigorous and descrip- 
tive. That was it. It was inac- 
curate, but it stuck. 

If anybody was in a cave, it

was the rest of humanity. Pain- 
fully, triumphantly, one man had 
climbed out. Now he couldn’t find 
his way back into the cave with 
the rest of us. 

What goes up doesn’t always 
come back down. 

That was the first day. After 
it came twenty-nine days of agon- 
ized suspense. 

The cave of night. I wish the 
phrase had been mine. 

That was it, the tag, the sym- 
bol. It was the first thing a man 
saw when he glanced at the news- 
paper. It was the way people 
talked about it: “What’s the lat-

est about the cave?” It summed 
it all up, the drama, the anxiety, 
the hope. 

M AYBE it was the Floyd Col- 
■ lins influence. The papers 
dug up their files on that old 
tragedy, reminiscing, comparing; 
and they remembered the little 
girl — Kathy Fiscus, wasn’t it? — 
who was trapped in that aban- 
doned, California drain pipe; and 
a number of others. 

Periodically, it happens, a se- 
quence of events so accidentally 
dramatic that men lose their 
hatreds, their terrors, their shy- 
nesses, their inadequacies, and the 
human race momentarily recog- 
nizes its kinship. 

The essential ingredients are 
these: A person must be in un- 
usual and desperate peril. The 
peril must have duration. There 
must be proof that the person 
is still alive. Rescue attempts 
must be made. Publicity must be 
widespread. 

One could probably be con- 
structed artificially, but if the 
world ever discovered the fraud, 
it would never forgive. 

Like many others, I have tried 
to analyze what makes a niggling, 
squabbling, callous race of beings 
suddenly share that most human 
emotion of sympathy, and, like 
them, I have not succeeded. Sud- 
denly a distant stranger will mean 
more than their own comfort. 



Every waking moment, they 
pray: Live, Floyd! Live, Kathy! 
Live, Rev! 

We pass on the street, we who 
would not have nodded, and ask, 
“Will they get there in time?” 

Optimists and pessimists alike, 
we hope so. We all hope so. 

In a sense, this one was differ- 
ent. This was purposeful. Know- 
ing the risk, accepting it because 
there was no other way to do 
what had to be done, Rev had 
gone into the cave of night. The 
accident was that he could not 
return. 

The news came out of nowhere 
— literally — to an unsuspecting 
world. The earliest mention the 
historians have been able to lo- 
cate was an item about a ham 
radio operator in Davenport, 
Iowa. He picked up a distress 
signal on a sticky-hot June eve- 
ning. 

The message, he said later, 
seemed to fade in, reach a peak, 
and fade out: 

. and fuel tanks empty. 
— ceiver broke . transmitting 
in clear so someone can pick this 
up, and ... no way to get back 
. stuck . .” 

A small enough beginning. 

The next message was received 
by a military base radio watch 
near Fairbanks, Alaska. That was 
early in the morning. Half an 
hour later, a night-shift worker in 
Boston heard something on his 



46 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



short-wave set that sent him rush- 
ing to the telephone. 

That morning, the whole world 
learned the story. It broke over 
them, a wave of excitement and 
concern. Orbiting 1,075 miles 
above their heads was a man, an 
officer of the United States Air 
Force, in a fuelless spaceship. 

A LL by itself, the spaceship 
part would have captured the 
world's attention. It was achieve- 
ment as monumental as anything 
Man has ever done and far more 
spectacular. It was liberation 
from the tyranny of Earth, this 
jealous mother who had bound 
her children tight with the apron 
strings of gravity. 

Man was free. It was a symbol 
that nothing is completely and 
finally impossible if Man wants 
it hard enough and long enough. 

There are regions that human- 
ity finds peculiarly congenial. 
Like all Earth’s creatures, Man 
is a product and a victim of en- 
vironment. His triumph is that 
the slave became the master. Un- 
like more specialized animals, he 
distributed himself across the en- 
tire surface of the Earth, from the 
frozen Antarctic continent to the 
Arctic icecap. 

Man became an equatorial ani- 
mal, a temperate zone animal, an 
arctic animal. He became a plain 
dweller, a valley dweller, a moun- 
tain dweller. The swamp and the 



desert became equally his home. 

Man made his own environ- 
ment. 

With his inventive mind and his 
dexterous hands, he fashioned it, 
conquered cold and heat, damp- 
ness, aridness, land, sea, air. Now, 
with his science, he had conquered 
everything. He had become inde- 
pendent of the world that bore 
him. 

It was a birthday cake for all 
mankind, celebrating its coming 
of age. 

Brutally, the disaster was icing 
on the cake. 

But it was more, too. When 
everything is considered, perhaps 
it was the aspect that, for a few, 
brief days, united humanity and 
made possible what we did. 

It was a sign: Man is never 
completely independent of Earth ; 
he carries with him his environ- 
ment; he is always and forever a 
part of humanity. It was a con- 
quest mellowed by a confession of 
mortality and error. 

It was a statement: Man has 
within him the qualities of great- 
ness that will never accept the 
restraints of circumstance, and 
yet he carries, too, the seeds of 
fallibility that we all recognize in 
ourselves. 

Rev was one of us. His triumph 
was our triumph ; his peril — more 
fully and finely — was our peril. 

Reverdy L. McMillen, III, first 
lieutenant, U.S.A.F. Pilot. Rocket

jockey. Man. Rev. He was only a 
thousand miles away, calling for 
help, but those miles were straight 
up. We got to know him as well 
as any member of our own 
family. 

f I ''HE news came as a great per- 
-*■ sonal shock to me. I knew 
Rev. We had become good friends 
in college, and fortune had 
thrown us together in the Air 
Force, a writer and a pilot. I had 
got out as soon as possible, but 
Rev had stayed in. I knew, vague- 
ly, that he had been testing 
rocket-powered airplanes with 
Chuck Yeager. But I had no idea 
that the rocket program was that 
close to space. 

Nobody did. It was a better- 
kept secret than the Manhattan 
Project. 

I remember staring at Rev’s 
picture in the evening newspaper 
— the straight black hair, the thin, 
rakish mustache, the Clark Gable 
ears, the reckless, rueful grin — 
and I felt again, like a physical 
thing, his great joy in living. It 
expressed itself in a hundred 
ways. He loved widely, but with 
discrimination. He ate well, drank 
heartily, reveled in expert jazz 
and artistic incentiveness, and 
talked incessantly. 

Now he was alone and soon all 
that might be extinguished. I 
told myself that I would help. 

That was a time of wild en- 



thusiasm. Men mobbed the Air 
Force Proving Grounds at Cocoa, 
Florida, wildly volunteering their 
services. But I was no engineer. 
I wasn’t even a welder or a 
riveter. At best, I was only a 
poor word mechanic. 

But words, at least, I could 
contribute. 

I made a hasty verbal agree- 
ment with a local paper and 
caught the first plane to Wash- 
ington, D. C. For a long time, I 
liked to think that what I wrote 
during the next few days had 
something to do with subsequent 
events, for many of my articles 
were picked up for reprint by 
other newspapers. 

The Washington fiasco was the 
responsibility of the Senate In- 
vestigating Committee. It sub- 
poenaed everybody in sight — 
which effectively removed them 
from the vital work they were 
doing. But within a day, the Com- 
mittee realized that it had bitten 
off a bite it could neither swallow 
nor spit out. 

General Beauregard Finch, 
head of the research and de- 
velopment program, was the 
tough morsel the Committee 
gagged on. Coldly, accurately, he 
described the development of the 
project, the scientific and tech- 
nical research, the tests, the build- 
ing of the ship, the training of 
the prospective crewmen, and the 
winnowing of the volunteers

down to one man. 

In words more eloquent because 
of their clipped precision, he de- 
scribed the takeoff of the giant 
three-stage ship, shoved upward 
on a lengthening arm of combin- 
ing hydrazine and nitric acid. 
Within fifty-six minutes, the re- 
maining third stage had reached 
its orbital height of 1,075 miles. 

It had coasted there. In order 
to maintain that orbit, the motors 
had to flicker on for fifteen 
seconds. 

At that moment, disaster laugh- 
ed at Man’s careful calculations. 

T>EFORE Rev could override 
the automatics, the motors 
had flamed for almost half a 
minute. The fuel he had depended 
upon to slow the ship so that it 
would drop, re-enter the atmos- 
phere and be reclaimed by Earth 
was almost gone. His efforts to 
counteract the excess speed re- 
sulted only in an approximation 
of the original orbit. 

The fact was this: Rev was up 
there. He would stay there until 
someone came and got him. 

And there was no way to get 
there. 

The Committee took that as an 
admission of guilt and incom- 
petence; they tried to lever them- 
selves free with it, but General 
Finch was not to be intimidated. 
A manned ship had been sent up 
because no mechanical or elec- 



tronic computer could contain 
the vast possibilities for decision 
and action built into a human 
being. 

The original computer was still 
the best all-purpose computer. 

There had been qnly one ship 
built, true. But there was good 
reason for that, a completely 
practical reason — money. 

Leaders are, by definition, 
ahead of the people. But this 
wasn’t a field in which they could 
show the way and wait for the 
people to follow. This was no 
expedition in ancient ships, no 
light exploring party, no pilot- 
plant operation. Like a parachute 
jump, it had to be successful the 
first time. 

This was an enterprise into 
new, expensive fields. It demand- 
ed money (billions of dollars), 
brains (the best available), and 
the hard, dedicated labor of men 
(thousands of them). 

General Finch became a na- 
tional hero that afternoon. He 
said, in bold words, “With the 
limited funds you gave us, we 
have done what we set out to do. 
We have demonstrated that space 
flight is possible, that a space 
platform is feasible. 

“If there is any inefficiency, if 
there is any blame for what has 
happened, it lies at the door of 
those who lacked confidence in 
the courage and ability of their 
countrymen to fight free of Earth

to the greatest glory. Senator, 
how did you vote on that?” 

But I am not writing a history. 
The shelves are full of them. I 
will touch on the international 
repercussions only enough to 
show that the event was no more 
a respecter of national boundaries 
than was Rev’s orbiting ship. 

''HE orbit was almost perpen- 
dicular to the equator. The 
ship traveled as far north as 
Nome, as far south as Little 
America on the Antarctic Con- 
tinent. It completed one giant 
circle every two hours. Mean- 
while, the Earth rotated beneath. 
If the ship had been equipped 
with adequate optical instru- 
ments, Rev could have observed 
every spot on Earth within 
twenty- four hours. He could have 
seen fleets and their dispositions, 
aircraft carriers and the planes 
taking off their decks, troop 
maneuvers. 

In the General Assembly of the 
United Nations, the Russian am- 
bassador protested this unwar- 
ranted and illegal violation of its 
national boundaries. He hinted 
darkly that it would not be al- 
lowed to continue. The U.S.S.R. 
had not been caught unprepared, 
he said. If the violation went on — 
“every few hours !" — drastic steps 
would be taken. 

World opinion reared up in in- 
dignation. The U.S.S.R. imme- 

THE CAVE OF NIGHT 



diately retreated and pretended, 
as only it could, that its belliger- 
ence had been an unwarranted in- 
ference and that it had never said 
anything of the sort, anyway. 

This was not a military ob- 
server above our heads. It was a 
man who would soon be dead un- 
less help reached him. 

A world offered what it had. 
Even the U.S.S.R. announced 
that it was outfitting a rescue 
ship, since its space program was 
already on the verge of success. 
And the American public re- 
sponded with more than a billion 
dollars within a week. Congress 
appropriated another billion. 
Thousands of men and women 
volunteered. 

The race began. 

Would the rescue party reach 
the ship in time? The world 
prayed. 

And it listened daily to the 
voice of a man it hoped to buy 
back from death. 

The problem shaped up like 
this: 

The trip had been planned to 
last for only a few days. By care- 
ful rationing, the food and water 
might be stretched out rfor more 
than a month, but the oxygen, by 
cutting down activity to conserve 
it, couldn’t possibly last more 
than thirty days. That was the 
absolute outside limit. 

I remember reading the care- 
fully detailed calculations in the 

51 



paper and studying them for 
some hopeful error. There was 
none. 

W ITHIN a few hours, the dis- 
carded first stage of the ship 
had been located floating in the 
Atlantic Ocean. It was towed 
back to Cocoa, Florida. Almost a 
week was needed to find and re- 
turn to the Proving Grounds the 
second stage, which had landed 
906 miles away. 

Both sections were practically 
undamaged; their fall had been 
cushioned by ribbon parachute. 
They could be cleaned, repaired 
and used again. The trouble was 
the vital third stage — the nose 
section. A new one had to be 
designed and built within a 
month. 

Space-madness became a new 
form of hysteria. We read statis- 
tics, we memorized insignificant 
details, we studied diagrams, we 
learned the risks and the dangers 
and how they would be met and 
conquered. It all became part of 
us. We watched the slow progress 
of the second ship and silently, 
tautly, urged it upward. 

The schedule overhead became 
part of everyone’s daily life. Work 
stopped while people rushed to 
windows or outside or to their 
television sets, hoping for a 
glimpse, a glint from the high, 
swift ship, so near, so untouch- 
ably far. 



And we listened to the voice 
from the cave of night: 

“I’ve been staring out the port- 
holes. I never tire of that. 
Through the one on the right, I 
see what looks like a black velvet 
curtain with a strong light behind 
it. There are pinpoint holes in the 
curtain and the light shines 
through, not winking the way 
stars do, but steady. There’s no 
air up here. That’s the reason. 
The mind can understand and 
still misinterpret. 

“My air is holding out better 
than I expected. By my figures, 
it should last twenty-seven days 
more. I shouldn’t use so much 
of it talking all the time, but it’s 
hard to stop. Talking, I feel as if 
I’m still in touch with Earth, 
still one of you, even if I am way 
up here. 

“Through the left-hand win- 
dow is San Francisco Bay, look- 
ing like a dark, wandering arm 
extended by the ocean octopus. 
The city itself looks like a heap 
of diamonds with trails scattered 
from it. It glitters up cheerfully, 
an old friend. It misses me, it 
says. Hurry home, it says. It’s 
gone now, out of sight. Good-by, 
Frisco! 

“Do you hear me down there? 
Sometimes I wonder. You can’t 
see me now. I’m in the Earth’s 
shadow. You’ll have to wait hours 
for the dawn. I’ll have mine in a 
few minutes. 



52 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“You’re all busy down there. 
I know that. If I know you, 
you’re all worrying about me, 
working to get me down, for- 
getting everything else. You don’t 
know what a feeling that is. I 
hope to Heaven you never have 
to, wonderful though it is. 

“Too bad the receiver was 
broken, but if it had to be one 
or the other, I’m glad it was the 
transmitter that came through. 
There’s only one of me. There are 
billions of you to talk to. 

“I wish there were some way I 
could be sure you were hearing 
me. Just that one thing might 
keep me from going crazy.” 

R EV, you were one in millions. 

We read all about your selec- 
tion, your training. You were our 
representative, picked with our 
greatest skill. 

Out of a thousand who passed 
the initial rigid requirements for 
education, physical and emotion- 
al condition and age, only five 
could qualify for space. They 
couldn’t be too tall, too stout, 
too young, too old. Medical and 
psychiatric tests weeded them 
out. 

One of the training machines — 
Lord, how we studied this — re- 
produces the acceleration strains 
of a blasting rocket. Another 
trains men for maneuvering in the 
weightlessness of space. A third 
duplicates the cramped, sealed 



conditions of a spaceship cabin. 
Out of the final five, you were 
the only one who qualified. 

No, Rev, if any of us could 
stay sane, it was you. 

There were thousands of sug- 
gestions, almost all of them use- 
less. Psychologists suggested self- 
hypnotism; cultists suggested 
yoga. One man sent in a detailed 
sketch of a giant electromagnet 
with which Rev’s ship could be 
drawn back to Earth. 

General Finch had the only 
practical idea. He outlined a plan 
for letting Rev know that we 
were listening. He picked out 
Kansas City and set the time. 
“Midnight,” he said. “On the dot. 
Not a minute earlier or later-. At 
that moment, he’ll be right over- 
head.” 

And at midnight, every light in 
the city went out and came back 
on and went out and came back 
on again. 

For a few awful moments, we 
wondered if the man up there in 
the cave of night had seen. Then 
came the voice we knew now so 
well that it seemed it had always 
been with us, a part of us, our 
dreams and our waking. 

The voice was husky with emo- 
tion: 

“Thanks . Thanks for listen- 
ing. Thanks, Kansas City. I saw 
you winking at me. I’m not alone. 
I know that now. I’ll never for- 
get. Thanks.” 



THE CAVE OF NIGHT 



53 



And silence then as the ship 
fell below the horizon. We pic- 
tured it to ourselves sometimes, 
continually circling the Earth, its 
trajectory exactly matching the 
curvature of the globe beneath it. 
We wondered if it would ever 
stop. 

Like the Moon, would it be a 
satellite of the Earth forever? 

We went through our daily 
chores like automatons while we 
watched the third stage of the 
rocket take shape. We raced 
against a dwindling air supply, 
and death raced to catch a ship 
moving at 15,800 miles per hour. 

VVTE watched the ship grow. 

” On our television screens, 
we saw the construction of the 
cellular fuel tanks, the rocket 
motors, and the fantastic multi- 
tude of pumps, valves, gauges, 
switches, circuits, transistors, and 
tubes. 

The personnel space was built 
to carry five men instead of one 
man. We watched it develop, a 
Spartan simplicity in the middle 
of the great complex, and it was 
as if we ourselves would live 
there, would watch those dials 
and instruments, would grip those 
chair-arm controls for the infini- 
tesimal sign that the automatic 
pilot had faltered, would feel the 
soft flesh and the softer internal 
organs being wrenched away from 
the unyielding bone, and would 



hurtle upward into the cave of 
night. 

We watched the plating wrap 
itself protectively around the 
vitals of the nose section. The 
wings were attached; they would 
make the ship a huge, metal 
glider in its unpowered descent 
to Earth after the job was done. 

We met the men who would 
man the ship. We grew to know 
them as we watched them train, 
saw them fighting artificial gravi- 
ties, testing spacesuits in simu- 
lated vacuums, practicing man- 
euvers in the weightless condition 
of free fall. 

That was what we lived for. 

And we listened to the voice 
that came to us out of the night: 

“Twenty - one days. Three 
weeks. Seems like more. Feel a 
little sluggish, but there’s no 
room for exercise in a coffin. 
The concentrated foods I’ve been 
eating are fine, but not for a 
steady diet. Oh, what I’d give for 
a piece of home-baked apple pie! 

“The weightlessness got me at 
first. Felt I was sitting on a ball 
that was spinning in all directions 
at once. Lost my breakfast a 
couple of times before I learned 
to stare at one thing. As long as 
you don’t let your eyes roam, 
you’re okay. 

“There’s Lake Michigan! My 
God, but it’s blue today! Dazzles 
the eyes! There’s Milwaukee, and 
how are the Braves doing? It 



54 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



must be a hot day in Chicago. 
It’s a little muggy up here, too. 
The water absorbers must be 
overloaded. 

“The air smells funny, but I’m 
not surprised. I must smell funny, 
too, after twenty-one days with- 
out a bath. Wish I could have 
one. There are an awful lot of 
things I used to take for granted 
and suddenly want more than — 

“Forget that, will you? Don’t 
worry about me. I’m fine. I 
know you’re working to get me 
down. If you don’t succeed, that’s 
okay with me. My life wouldn’t 
just be wasted. I’ve done what 
I’ve always wanted to do. I’d do 
it again. 

“Too bad, though, that we only 
had the money for one ship.” 

A ND again : “An hour ago, I 
saw the Sun rise over Russia. 
It looks like any other land from 
here, green where it should be 
green, farther north a sort of mud 
color, and then white where the 
snow is still deep. 

“Up here, you wonder why 
we’re so different when the land 
is the same. You think: we’re all 
children of the same mother 
planet. Who says we’re different? 

“Think I’m crazy? Maybe 
you’re right. It doesn’t matter 
much what I say as long as I say 
something. This is one time I 
won’t be interrupted. Did any 
man ever have such an audience?” 



No, Rev. Never. 

The voice from above, histor- 
ical now, preserved: 

“I guess the gadgets are all 
right. You slide-rule mechanics! 
You test-tube artists! You find- 
ing what you want? Getting the 
dope on cosmic rays, meteoric 
dust, those islands you could 
never map, the cloud formations, 
wind movements, all the weather 
data? Hope the telemetering 
gauges are working. They’re more 
important than my voice.” 

I don’t think so, Rev. But 
we got the data. We built some 
of it into the new ships. Ships, not 
ship, for we didn’t stop with one. 
Before we were finished, we had 
two complete three-stagers and a 
dozen nose sections. 

The voice: “Air’s bad tonight. 
Can’t seem to get a full breath. 
Sticks in the lungs. Doesn’t mat- 
ter, though. I wish you could all 
see what I have seen, the vast- 
spreading universe around Earth, 
like a bride in a soft veil. You’d 
know then that we belong out 
here.” 

We know, Rev. You led us out. 
You showed us the way. 

We listened and we watched. 
It seems to me now that we held 
our breath for thirty days. 

At last we watched the fuel 
pumping into the ship — nitric 
acid and hydrazine. A month ago, 
we did not know their names; 
now we recognize them as the 



THE CAVE OF NIGHT

very substances of life itself. It 
flowed through the long special 
hoses, dangerous, cautiously 
grounded, over half a million 
dollars’ worth of rocket fuel. 

Statisticians estimate that more 
than a hundred million Ameri- 
cans were watching their tele- 
vision sets that day. Watching 
and praying. 

Suddenly the view switched to 
the ship fleeing south above us. 
The technicians were expert now. 
The telescopes picked it up in- 
stantly, the focus perfect the first 
time, and tracked it across the 
sky until it dropped beyond the 
horizon. It looked no different 
now than when we had seen it 
first. 

B UT the voice that came from 
our speakers was different. It 
was weak. It coughed frequently 
and paused for breath. 

“Air very bad. Better hurry. 
Can’t last much longer . Silly! 
... Of course you’ll hurry. 

“Don’t want anyone feeling 
sorry for me . I’ve been living 
fast . Thirty days? I’ve seen 
360 sunrises, 360 sunsets ... I’ve 
seen what no man has ever seen 
before ... I was the first. That’s 
something . worth dying for . 

“I’ve seen the stars, clear and 
undiminished. They look cold, 
but there’s warmth to them and 
life. They have families of planets 
like our own sun, some of them 



. They must. God wouldn’t put 
them there for no purpose . 
They can be homes to our future 
generations. Or, if they have in- 
habitants, we can trade with 
them: goods, ideas, the love of 
creation . 

“But — more than this — I have 
seen the Earth. I have seen it — 
as no man has even seen it — 
turning below me like a fantastic 
ball, the seas like blue glass in the 
Sun ... or lashed into gray 
storm-peaks . and the land 
green with life . the cities of the 
world in the night, sparkling . 
and the people . 

“I have seen the Earth — there 
where I have lived and loved . 
I have known it better than any 
man and loved it better and 
known its children better ... It 
has been good . 

“Good-by ... I have a better 
tomb than the greatest conqueror 
Earth ever bore . Do not dis- 
turb . .” 

We wept. How could we help 
it? 

Rescue was so close and we 
could not hurry it. We watched 
impotently. The crew were hoist- 
ed far up into the nose section of 
the three-stage rocket. It stood as 
tall as a 24-story building. Hurry! 
we urged. But they could not 
hurry. The interception of a 
swiftly moving target is precision 
business. The takeoff was all cal- 
culated and impressed on the 



56 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



metal and glass and free elec- 
trons of an electronic computer. 

The ship was tightened down 
methodically. The spectators 
scurried back from the base of 
the ship. We waited. The ship 
waited. Tall and slim as it was, 
it seemed to crouch. Someone 
counted off the seconds to a 
breathless world : ten — nine — 
eight . five, four, three . 
one — fire! 

There was no flame, 'and then 
we saw it spurting into the air 
from the exhaust tunnel several 
hundred feet away. The ship bal- 
anced, unmoving, on a squat col- 
umn of incandescence; the col- 
umn stretched itself, grew tall; 
the huge ship picked up speed 
and dwindled into a point of 
brightness. 

The telescopic lenses found it, 
lost it, found it again. It arched 
over on its side and thrust itself 
seaward. At the end of 84 seconds, 
the rear jets faltered, and our 
hearts faltered with them. Then 
we saw that the first stage had 
been dropped. The rest of the 
ship moved off on a new fiery 
trail. A ring-shaped ribbon para- 
chute blossomed out of the third 
stage and slowed it rapidly. 

The second stage dropped away 
124 seconds later. The nose sec- 
tion, with its human cargo, its 
rescue equipment, went on alone. 
At 63 miles altitude, the flaring 
exhaust cut out. The third stage 

THE CAVE OF NIGHT 



would coast up the gravitational 
hill more than a thousand miles. 

O UR stomachs were knotted 
with dread as the rescue ship 
disappeared beyond the horizon 
of the farthest television camera. 
By this time, it was on the other 
side of the world, speeding toward 
a carefully planned rendezvous 
with its sister. 

Hang on, Rev! Don't give up! 
Fifty-six minutes. That was 
how long we had to wait. Fifty- 
six minutes from the takeoff until 
the ship was in its orbit. After 
that, the party would need time 
to match speeds, to send a space- 
suited crewman drifting across 
the emptiness between, over the 
vast, eerily turning sphere of the 
Earth beneath. 

In imagination, we followed 
them. 

Minutes would be lost while 
the rescuer clung to the ship, 
opened the airlock cautiously so 
that none of the precious rem- 
nants of air would be lost, and 
passed into the ship where one 
man had known utter loneliness. 
We waited. We hoped. 

Fifty-six minutes. They passed. 
An hour. Thirty minutes more. 
We reminded ourselves — and 
were reminded — that the first 
concern was Rev. It might be 
hours before we would get any 
real news. 

The tension mounted unbear- 



57 



able. We waited — a nation, a 
world — for relief. 

At eighteen minutes less than 
two hours — too soon, we told our- 
selves, lest we hope too much — 
we heard the voice of Captain 
Frank Pickrell, who was later to 
become the first commander of 
the Doughnut. 

“I have just entered the ship,” 
he said slowly. ‘‘The airlock was 
open.” He paused. The implica- 
tions stunned our emotions; we 
listened mutely. “Lieutenant Mc- 
Millen is dead. He died heroic- 
ally, waiting until all hope was 
gone, until every oxygen gauge 
stood at zero. And then — well, the 
airlock was open when we arrived. 

“In accordance with his own 
wishes, his body will be left here 
in its eternal orbit. This ship will 
be his tomb for all men to see 
when they look up toward the 
stars. As long as there are men 
on Earth, it will circle above 
them, an everlasting reminder of 
what men have done and what 
men can do. 

“That was Lieutenant McMil- 
len’s hope. This he did not only 
as an American, but as a man, 
dying for all humanity, and all 
humanity can glory for it. 

“From this moment, let this be 
his shrine, sacred to all the gen- 
erations of spacemen, inviolate. 
And let it be a symbol that Man’s 
dreams can be realized, but some- 
times the price is steep. 



“I am going to leave now. My 
feet will be the last to touch this 
deck. The oxygen I released is 
almost used up. Lieutenant Mc- 
Millen is in his control chair, 
staring out toward the stars. I will 
leave the airlock doors open be- 
hind me. Let the airless, frigid 
arms of space protect and pre- 
serve for all eternity the man 
they would not let go.” 

Good-by, Rev! Farewell! Good 
night! 

R EV was not long alone. He 
was the first, but not the last 
to receive a space burial and a 
hero s farewell. 

This, as I said, is no history 
of the conquest of space. Every 
child knows the story as well as 
I and can identify the make of a 
spaceship more swiftly. 

The story of the combined 
efforts that built the orbital plat- 
form irreverently called the 
Doughnut has been told by oth- 
ers. We have learned at length the 
political triumph that placed it 
under United Nations control. 

Its contribution to our daily 
lives has received the accolade of 
the commonplace. It is an ob- 
servatory, a laboratory, and a 
guardian. Startling discoveries 
have come out of that weightless, 
airless, heatless place. It has 
learned how weather is made and 
predicted it with incredible ac- 
curacy. It has observed the stars 



58 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



clear of the veil of the atmos- 
phere. And it has insured our 
peace . 

It has paid its way. No one 
can question that. It and its 
smaller relay stations made pos- 
sible today’s worldwide television 
and radio network. There is no 
place on Earth where a free voice 
cannot be heard or the face of 
freedom be seen. Sometimes we 
find ourselves wondering how it 
would have been any other way. 

And we have had adventure. 
We have traveled to the dead 
gypsum seas of the Moon with 
the first exploration party. This 
year, we will solve the mysteries 
of Mars. From our armchairs, we 
will thrill to the discoveries of our 
pioneers — our stand-ins, so to 
speak. It has given us a common 
heritage, a common goal, and for 
the first time we are united. 

This I mention only for back- 
ground; no one will argue that 
the conquest of space was not of 
incalculable benefit to all man- 
kind. 

The whole thing came back to 
me recently, an overpowering 
flood of memory. I was skirting 
Times Square, where every face 
is a stranger’s, and suddenly I 
stopped, incredulous. 

“Rev!” I shouted. 

The man kept on walking. He 
passed me without a glance. I 
turned around and stared after 
him. I started to run. I grabbed 

THE CAVE OF NIGHT 



him by the arm. “Rev!” I said 
huskily, swinging him around. “Is 
it really your 1 ” 

The man smiled politely. “You 
must have mistaken me for some- 
one else.” He unclampered my 
fingers easily and moved away. I 
realized then that there were two 
men with him, one on each side. 
I felt their eyes on my face, 
memorizing it. 

Probably it didn’t mean any- 
thing. We all have our doubles. I 
could have been mistaken. 

But it started me remembering 
and thinking. 

The first thing the rocket ex- 
perts had to consider was expense. 
They didn’t have the money. 
The second thing was weight, 
even a medium-sized man is 
heavy when rocket payloads are 
reckoned, and the stores and 
equipment essential to his sur- 
vival are many times heavier. 

If Rev had escaped alive, why 
had they announced that he was 
dead? But I knew the question 
was all wrong. 

TF my speculations were right, 
Rev had never been up there 
at all. The essential payload was 
only a thirty-day recording and a 
transmitter. Even if the major 
feat of sending up a manned 
rocket was beyond their means 
and their techniques, they could 
send up that much. 

Then they got the money ; they 

59 



got the volunteers and the tech- 
niques. 

I suppose the telemetered re- 
ports from the rocket helped. 
But what they accomplished in 
thirty days was an unparalleled 
miracle. 

The timing of the recording 
must have taken months of work; 
but the vital part of the scheme 
was secrecy. General Finch had 
to know and Captain — now 
Colonel — Pickrell. A few others — 
workmen, administrators — and 
Rev . 

What could they do with him? 
Disguise him? Yes. And then 
hide him in the biggest city in 
the world. They would have done 
it that way. 

It gave me a funny, sick kind 
of feeling, thinking about it. Like 
everybody else, I don’t like to be 
taken in by a phony plea. And 
this was a fraud perpetrated on 
all humanity. 

Yet it had led us to the planets. 
Perhaps it would lead us beyond, 
even to the stars. I asked myself : 
could they have done it any other 
way? 

I would like to think I was 
mistaken. This myth has become 



part of us. We lived through it 
ourselves, helped make it. Some- 
day, I tell myself, a spaceman 
whose reverence is greater than 
his obedience will make a pil- 
grimage to that swift shrine and 
find only an empty shell. 

I shudder then. 

This pulled us together. In a 
sense, it keeps us together. Noth- 
ing is more important than that. 

I try to convince myself that I 
was mistaken. The straight black 
hair was gray at the temples now 
and cut much shorter. The mus- 
tache was gone. The Clark Gable 
ears were flat to the head; that’s 
a simple operation, I understand. 

But grins are hard to change. 
And anyone who lived through 
those thirty days will never for- 
get that voice. 

I think about Rev and the life 
he must have now, the things he 
loved and can never enjoy again, 
and I realize perhaps he made the 
greater sacrifice. 

I think sometimes he must 
wish he were really in the cave 
of night, seated in that icy control 
chair 1,075 miles above, staring 
out at the stars.

DEAD 

MAN’S 

PLANET 



By WILLIAM MORRISON 

Illustrated by EMSH 
When a driven man arrives at 
a cemetery world, what else 
can it be but journey's end— 
and the start of a new one? 



O UTSIDE the ship, it was 
the sun that blazed an- 
grily. Inside, it was Sam 
Wilson’s temper. “Study your 
lessons,” he snarled, with a sav- 
ageness that surprised himself, 
“or I’ll never let you set foot on 
this planet at all.” 

DEAD MAN'S PLANET 



“Okay, Pop,” said Mark, a lit- 
tle white around the nostrils. He 
looked old for so young a kid. “I 
didn’t mean anything wrong.” 

“I don’t care what you meant. 
You do as you’re told.” 

In the quiet that followed, 
broken only by the hum of the 

61 



arithmetic-tape, Sam wondered 
at himself. As kids went, Mark 
had never been a nuisance. Cer- 
tainly Rhoda had never had any 
trouble with him. But Rhoda 
had been altogether different. 
Sam was tough and he had al- 
ways got a sense of satisfaction 
out of knowing that he was hard- 
boiled. Or at least that was once 
true. Rhoda had been sweet, gen- 
tle . 

He aroused himself from 
thoughts of her by calling, 
“Mark!” 

“Yes, Pop?” 

His voice had been harsher 
than he had intended. Over the 
past few weeks he seemed gradu- 
ally to have been losing control of 
it. Now, although he was going 
to do his son a favor, he sounded 
like a slavemaster threatening a 
beating. “You can shut off your 
arithmetic lesson. We’re going 
out.” 

“But didn’t you want me — ” 

“I changed my mind.” 

Mark seemed more troubled 
than pleased, as if a father who 
changed his mind so readily was 
a man to be wary of. 

I’m on edge all the time, 
thought Sam, and I’m getting 
him that way, too. I’ll have to re- 
gain control of myself. 

H E had long ago made all the 
necessary tests for such pos- 
sible dangers as lack of oxygen 



and the presence of infectious or- 
ganisms. On all counts, the plan- 
et had passed muster. The sun, 
whiter than Sol, was almost hot 
enough to make him forget the 
chill he carried deep inside him. 
Almost, but not quite, especially 
as the air, though breathable, 
was thin and deficient in nitro- 
gen. The countryside was bleak, 
inspiring in him the thought that 
there are two kinds of desolation; 
the one that precedes the coming 
of Man, and the one which he 
knows only too well how to cre- 
ate wherever he goes. The desola- 
tion here was non-human. 

“It — it’s like a cemetery, ain’t 
it, Pop?” 

Sam looked at his son sharply. 
Kids of ten were not supposed to 
know much about cemeteries. 
Nor, for that matter, were kids 
of six, Mark’s age when the fu- 
neral had taken place. Sam 
hadn’t let him attend, but evi- 
dently the incident had made a 
deeper impression on his mind 
than Sam had realized. He would 
always remember a cemetery as 
the place where his mother lived. 
Perhaps he missed Rhoda almost 
as much as his father did. 

“It’s different from a ceme- 
tery,” said Sam. “There’s nobody 
buried here. Looks like we’re the 
first human beings ever to set 
foot on this place.” 

“Do you think we’ll find ani- 
mals to catch, Pop?” 



62 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“I don’t see signs of any ani- 
mals.” 

That was part of Sam’s private 
fiction, that he was looking for 
strange animals to be sold to 
zoos or circuses. Actually he was 
seeking less to find anything new 
than to lose something he carried 
with him, and succeeding in 
neither attempt. 

Mark shivered in the sun. “It’s 
kind of lonely,” he said. 

“More lonely than the ship?” 

“It’s different. It’s bigger, so 
it’s more lonely.” 

I’m not so sure, argued Sam 
mentally. In the ship, we have 
all of space around us, and noth- 
ing’s bigger than that. Still, your 
opinion has to be respected. 
You’re almost as great an expert 
on the various kinds of loneliness 
as I am. The difference is that 
you’re loneliest when you’re 
away from people. I’m loneliest 
in a crowd. That’s why I don’t 
mind this planet so much. 

He walked ahead, Mark fol- 
lowing almost reluctantly. The 
ground was rocky and the shrub- 
like vegetation sparse and stunt- 
ed, ranging in color from greenish 
gray to brown. It seemed hardly 
capable of supporting a large 
animal population. If there were 
any animals here at all, they 
were probably too small to be 
impressive, and would be of lit- 
tle interest to exhibitors. 

They walked in silence for a 

DEAD MAN'S PLANET 



few moments, and then Sam 
asked, “Want to go on?” 

“I want to finish my study- 

‘ - »> 
mg. 

That was something new. 
“Okay,” said Sam, and turned 
back. 

1 1 'HEY were approaching the 
ship when the sound of a peb- 
ble falling came to Sam’s ears. 
Automatically, his hand reached 
for his gun, and he swung around 
to face what might be danger. As 
he did so, something snarled and 
fled. He could see no sign of mo- 
tion, but he could hear the scat- 
tering of other pebbles along a 
gully as the creature retreated. 

“Looks like we’re not alone 
here, after all,” he said. “Wonder 
what that was.” 

“It couldn’t have been very 
big,” said Mark. “Big animals 
don’t run away.” 

“Not usually, unless they’re 
smart, or they’ve met people be- 
fore. I’ll have to set traps.” 

“Do you think maybe if you 
caught him you could sell him 
to a circus, Pop?” 

“I’ll have to see what he’s like, 
first,” said Sam. He looked 
around. “If there’s one animal, 
there are likely to be others. It’s 
strange that I didn’t detect any 
sign of them.” 

He put his arm absently over 
Mark’s shoulder. He didn’t no- 
tice the expression on the kid’s 

63 



face at this unexpected gesture. 

When they were inside the ship 
again, Mark said, “Guess I’d bet- 
ter get back to my arithmetic.” 
“In a minute,” said Sam. “I 
want to talk to you first.” He 
dropped wearily into a seat, al- 
though he had done nothing that 
should have tired him out. His 
son looked at him expectantly. 
“Mark, do you like traveling 
around with me?” 

“Sure, Pop, I like to be with 
you.” 

“Not seeing anybody else? No 
other kids, no people of any 
kind? Just being with me, learn- 
ing your lessons from tapes, and 
having your test papers corrected 
automatically? You don’t get 
tired of it?” 

Mark hesitated despite him- 
self. Then he said loyally, “I’d 
rather be with you than anybody 
else. When Mom — when Mom 
died — I didn’t want to see any- 
body.” 

“I know how you felt. But that 
was four years ago. You can’t 
grow up alone. Now what you 
need to do is meet people, learn 
how they talk and think and feel. 
You can’t learn those things 
from tapes, and you can’t learn 
them from me.” 

Mark said stubbornly, “I like 
to be with you.” 

“I’m not much of a person to 
be with. Don’t think I don’t 
know it. I’m mean and surly, and 



my temper’s getting worse by the 
day. I can’t associate with people 
any more. But you can. I was 
thinking maybe I’d leave you — ” 

“No!” cried Mark. 

“Not in an orphanage or any- 
thing like that. But I have some 
friends whose kids are growing 
up — ” 

“No. I won’t go. If you send 
me, I’ll run away. I want to be 
with you.” 

“Okay,” said Sam. “That’s 
that.” 

But it wasn’t, and he knew it. 
Even as he went about preparing 
his traps, he knew it. 

A S it turned out, the only ani- 
mals he caught in his traps 
were small ones which tore them- 
selves in two and then scampered 
off, each half running in a dif- 
ferent direction. For the animal 
which had made those noises, no 
traps were necessary. Later on he 
heard a noise outside again, and 
he went out cautiously, gun in 
hand. The animal backed away, 
but he saw it, then he heard it 
bark. So did Mark, who had fol- 
lowed him. 

Mark’s eyes almost popped. 
It was four years since he had 
heard the sound, but he knew at 
once what it was. “Gosh! A dog! 
How do you s’pose he got here?” 
“I don’t know,” said Sam. 
“Your guess is as good as mine.” 
“But if we’re the first human 



DEAD MAN'S PLANET 



65 



beings to land here — it ain’t pos- 
sible!” 

“I know that. But there he is.” 

At the sound of their voices, 
the dog broke into a series of fu- 
rious barks, backing away as it 
did so. 

“What kind is he, Pop?” 

“He looks like a mongrel to 
me. A bad tempered medium- 
sized mongrel with an ugly look 
about him. Maybe I ought to 
shoot him and get it over with.” 

“Shoot him? Don’t do that! I 
want him as a pet.” 

“He looks too wild to make 
much of a pet.” 

The dog gave one last bark of 
defiance, turned, and fled in the 
same general direction, Sam no- 
ticed, as he had run last time. 

“Maybe dogs do grow on other 
planets, Pop.” 

“Only if men have brought 
them there.” 

“Then that means there was a 
ship here?” 

“At some time or other there 
was a ship. I don’t think it was 
smashed up, or I’d have seen 
wreckage when I cruised around 
before landing. That clog was 
either left here by mistake, or de- 
liberately marooned.” 

“Maybe — maybe he’s with 
somebody who’s still here.” 

“Not likely,” said Sam thought- 
fully. “He wanders around too 
freely, and he seems unused to 
the presence of human beings. 



Besides, no men would be likely 
to live here long without shelter. 
And I’ve seen no sign of any house 
or hut.” 

“Could he belong to a being 
that wasn’t human?” 

“No,” replied Sam with cer- 
tainty. “Only human beings have 
been able to domesticate dogs. If 
a dog is here, a human being was 
once here. That’s definite.” 

“He would make a good pet,” 
said Mark longingly. 

“Not that one. Maybe I should 
have got you a dog long ago. It 
might have been just the kind of 
companionship you needed. But 
you can’t make a pet of this ani- 
mal. He’s been away from people 
too long, and he’s developed 
some mean habits.” And he add- 
ed mentally, “Like me.” 

“I could train him,” said Mark. 
“He wouldn’t be any trouble at 
all, Pop. I’d train him and feed 
him, and he’d be just like one of 
us. And — and like you say, Pop, 
it wouldn’t be so lonely for me.” 
Kids don’t give up easily, 
thought Sam. All the same, he 
had an idea that with this dog 
all the persistence in the world 
would be useless. He shrugged, 
and said simply, “We’ll see.” 
And then they went into the ship 
to eat. 

A LL through the meal he could 
tell that Mark was thinking 
about the dog. The boy’s 



66 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



thoughts seemed to affect his ap- 
petite. For the first time, he left 
some of his proteinex on the 
plate. 

“I’m not very hungry today,” 
he said apologetically. “May- 
be — ” He looked inquiringly at 
his father. 

“Go ahead and finish it,” said 
Sam. “We’ve got plenty of food. 
I’ll fix up something else for the 
dog.” 

“But I want to feed him my- 
self, Pop. I want him to get used 
to me feeding him.” 

“I’ll give you your chance 
later.” 

Afterwards, Sam thriftily 
opened an old can of a less ex- 
pensive variety of proteinex and 
put half of it on a platter, which 
Mark carried outside the ship. 
He moved off about a hundred 
yards in the direction the dog 
had taken, and set the platter 
down on a rock. 

“The wind is blowing the 
wrong way,” said Sam. “Let’s 
wait a while.” 

I N ten minutes the wind shift- 
ed, and if the dog was near, 
Sam felt certain that he had 
picked up both their scent and 
that of the food. That his feeling 
was correct was shown by the 
sudden appearance of the ani- 
mal, who barked again, but this 
time not so fiercely. And he 
stopped barking to sniff hungrily, 



at the same time keeping his dis- 
tance. 

“Here, mutt,” called Mark. 

“I’m afraid he won’t come any 
closer while we’re around,” said 
Sam. “If you want him to have 
that food, you’d better go away 
from it.” 

Mark reluctantly backed away 
with his father. The dog ap- 
proached the food, finally rush- 
ing down upon it as ,if he feared 
it would escape, and gobbled it. 

In the days that followed, they 
continued to feed him, and the 
animal became relatively tame. 
He stopped oarking at them, and 
at times let Mark come within a 
few feet of him. But he never 
allowed Mark to come close 
enough to touch him, and he was 
especially wary of Sam. The lat- 
ter could see, however, that there 
was nothing around the smooth 
furred neck. The collar, if it had 
ever existed, had evidently been 
worn away. 

“So we can’t find out what his 
name is,” said Mark in disap- 
pointment. “Here Prince, here 
Spot, here Rover — ” 

The animal answered to none 
of the traditional dog names, nor 
to several of the newer ones that 
Mark recalled. 

After the dog had been with 
them for a half hour or so he 
usually trotted off in the direc- 
tion of what they had come to 
consider his lair. 



DEAD MAN'S PLANET 



67 



“He doesn’t seem to be getting 
tame enough for a pet,” said 
Sam. “That’s one idea I’m afraid 
you’ll have to give up.” 

“All he needs is a little more 
time,” said Mark.- “He’s getting 

used to me.” Then a sudden fear 

/ 

struck him, and he added, 
“You’re not going to leave here 
yet, are you, Pop? I thought you 
wanted to catch some big ani- 
mals.” 

“There aren’t any other big 
animals,” replied Sam. “Just 
those small ones who came apart 
in the traps, and they’re not 
worth catching. But I’ll stay. 
This place is as good as any 
other. I won’t leave it yet.” 

IN fact, the stay on the planet, 
-*■ bleak as the place was, seemed 
to be less unpleasant than cruis- 
ing aimlessly through space. 
Mark had been starved for com- 
panionship of someone besides 
his father, and in a way, with- 
out making too many demands, 
the dog was a companion. Won- 
dering about the beast and try- 
ing to tame him gave them 
something with which to occupy 
their minds. It had been several 
days, realized Sam, since he had 
last snapped at Mark. 

It had become quite certain 
now that there was no other hu- 
man being around. The dog’s 
eagerness for the food showed 
that no one else had taken care 



of him for a long time. Evidently 
he had been forced to feed him- 
self on the small and elusive na- 
tive animals which he could run 
down. 

One of the things that puzzled 
Sam was the dog’s obvious anx- 
iety to leave the neighborhood of 
the ship after a short period and 
return to his lair. And one day, 
driven by curiosity, Sam fol- 
lowed him, with Mark coming 
along, too. 

The dog had become suffi- 
ciently accustomed to them by 
now not to resent their presence, 
and it was easy to keep him in 
sight. He led the way for at least 
two miles, over rocky ground and 
past a small stream. Quite unex- 
pectedly he stopped and began to 
whine and sniff the ground. As 
Sam and Mark approached, he 
turned on them, barking furi- 
ously. 

The man and boy exchanged 
glances. “He’s acting just like he 
did in the beginning,” said Mark. 

“There’s something in the 
ground,” said Sam. “I’m going to 
find out what it is.” And he drew 
his gun. 

“You’re not going to kill him, 
Pop!” 

“I’ll just put him to sleep. An 
anaesthetic pellet of the kind I 
use for trapping ought to do the 
trick.” 

But one pellet turned out to be 
not enough. It required the 



68 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



bursting of three pellets before 
the animal finally trembled, 
came to a halt, and with eyes 
glazed, fell over on the ground. 

When they approached closer, 
Sam caught sight of half a dozen 
stones, roughly piled together. 
He said, “Better get back, Mark. 
This may not be pleasant.” 
“You think — you think some- 
body’s buried here?” 

“Very likely. I’m going to see.” 

U SING a flat rock with a sharp 
edge as an improvised spade, 
he began to dig. The ground was 
hard, and the rock was not the 
best of tools. It took him half an 
hour tc^ reach the first bone, and 
another half-hour to uncover the 
rest. 

Mark had come up behind him 
and was watching with no sign of 
revulsion. He said, “I — I was 
afraid there might be a body, 
Pop.” 

“So was I. It looks as if the 
man died so long ago that every- 
thing else has rotted away, ex- 
cept for a few metal clasps. No 
other sign of shoes or clothes. 
And no indication of how this 
happened.” 

“You think he was the dog’s 
master?” 

“Evidently.” 

They both stared at the sleep- 
ing animal. Then Sam shrugged, 
and began to fill the shallow 
grave again. Mark helped him 

DEAD MAN'S PLANET 



push in the dirt and stamp it 
down into place. Finally they 
moved the stones back. 

They were about to leave when 
Mark cried out, “Look at that 
rock!” 

Staring where his son pointed, 
Sam saw a gray column about 
four feet high, with four smooth 
lateral sides. Rectangular prisms 
of this size were rare in nature. 
This was obviously the work of 
human hands, and of a blasting 
rod as well, to judge by the sides, 
which showed evidence of having 
been fused before weathering had 
cut into them. At first he had 
thought the column was a grave- 
stone. But there was no inscrip- 
tion upon it. There was nothing 
but a thin deep groove that ran 
horizontally around the four 
sides, several inches from the top. 

“What does it mean, Pop?” 

“Let’s find out. It’s obviously 
been put here as some sort of 
memorial. As for this groove — ” 

He put his hands on the top of 
the stone and lifted. As he had 
half expected, it separated at the 
horizontal groove. The top of the 
stone was the lid of a box. Inside 
lay a plastic container. 

“Some kind of plastic we don’t 
make any more,” muttered Sam. 

“Aren’t you going to open it?” 
asked Mark eagerly. “Maybe it 
tells about the grave and the 
dog’s name.” 

The plastic came open at a 

69 



slight tug. Inside were several 
strong sheets of paper. Sam 
stared at them and said, “It’s 
writing, sure enough. But in some 
language I don’t understand.” 
“We can put it in our mechan- 
ical translator,” said Mark. 
“That can tell us what it means.” 
“That’s what we’ll do.” 
“Aren’t we going to take the 
dog with us. Pop?” 

“No, we’ll leave him here. He’ll 
come to in a little while.” 

W ALKING back to their ship, 
Mark continued to show an 
excitement that was unusual for 
him. “You know what?” he said. 
“I’ll bet we’re going to learn what 
the dog’s name is.” 

“I doubt if whoever wrote this 
thing would bother about a trifle 
like that.” 

“But that’s important. You’ll 
see, Pop, you’ll see!” 

At the ship, Sam inserted the 
sheets into the reader section of 
his translator and started the mo- 
tor. The selector swung into ac- 
tion. 

“Before it can translate, it has 
to decide what language this is,” 
he explained. 

“Will that take long?” 

“A few minutes if we’re lucky, 
a couple of hours if we’re not. 
After that, I think the translation 
itself shouldn’t take more than a 
few minutes. While we’re wait- 
ing, we might as well eat.” 



“I’m not hungry,” said Mark. 

“You’d better eat anyway.” 

“Just a little bit, maybe. You 
know what I think, Pop? When 
I call the dog by his name, he’ll 
know I’m his friend and he’ll 
come to me. Then he’ll really be 
my pet.” 

“Don’t count too much on it,” 
said Sam. And thought once 
more how lonely his son must be, 
to center so much hope in a half- 
wild beast. 

A light glowed suddenly in the 
translator. The selector had 
found the proper language. Now 
it began to translate. 

Twenty minutes later, its work 
had been completed. As Sam si- 
lently began to read, Mark 
bumped against him, knocking 
the translation from his hand. 
Sam’s first reaction was anger at 
the boy’s clumsiness. Then he 
became aware of the hope and 
the fear that lay behind Mark’s 
excitement, and bit back the 
angry words which had almost 
reached his lips. 

“Easy, Mark, easy,” he said. 
He picked up the translation 
again and sat down. “You can 
read it over my shoulder, if you 
want to.” 

“I just want to find out the 
dog’s name.” 

“The important thing is his 
master’s name. Julian Hagstrom, 
it says. And he was on a space- 
ship with his brother, Raoul.” 



70 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Mark’s eyes had skipped 
ahead. “Look, Pop, here’s the 
dog’s name — Arkem! I never 
heard of a dog having a name 
like that! What does it mean?” 
“I wouldn’t know,” muttered 
Sam absently, still reading. 

But Mark wasn’t actually in- 
terested in his answer. He ran 
outside. “Arkem!” he called. 
“Arkem!” 

There was nothing he could in- 
terpret as an answer. After a mo- 
ment or two he came into the 
ship again, his face betraying his 
disappointment. “I guess he 
doesn’t hear me. He’s too far 
away.” 

Sam nodded. He had put the 
translation down and was star- 
ing straight ahead of him, as if 
looking through the ship’s side. 
“Is anything the matter, Pop?” 
“What? Oh, no, nothing’s the 
matter. I was just thinking about 
what I read here.” 

“They had an accident, didn’t 
they? How did it happen?” 

“TT happened because their 
ship wasn’t as good as ours. 
Julian Hagstrom, the man who 
was killed, was buried here by 
his brother. Raoul put this rec- 
ord in the stone to mark his 
grave. I think he also engraved 
something on the stone itself. 
But that’s been worn away.” 

“It must have been a long time 
ago. Maybe years.” 

DEAD MAN'S PLANET 



“Yes, it was years ago. After 
he buried Julian, Raoul tried to 
make repairs, and headed in a 
direction where he hoped he’d 
find a civilized planet. He never 
made it.” 

“How can you know that? He 
wrote the paper before he started 
out.” 

“If he had made it, we’d have 
heard of him. We’d certainly 
have heard of him.” Sam’s face 
was bleak. “And Rhoda — your 
mother — would still be alive.” 

Mark looked puzzled, and 
stared at the translation once 
more. “It says here he tried to 
re-reverse the aging process. 
What does that mean? And 
what’s immortality, Pop?” 

“Something he and his brother 
were looking for. Something to 
keep people from ever dying. 
They had a ship full of dogs and 
other animals. All died in their 
experiments — all but Arkem. 
They had high hopes of Arkem. 
He lived through a number of 
different treatments and became 
quite a pet of Julian’s. Then 
came the crash. Their method 
wasn’t proof against accidental 
death, and at any rate they 
hadn’t applied it yet to them- 
selves. 

“After Raoul buried his broth- 
er, the dog was miserable, and 
howled so much that Raoul de- 
cided to leave him behind. He 
was helped to reach this decision 

71 



by the fact that the ship had lost 
much of its air in the accident, 
and he knew that the air-purify- 
ing mechanism wasn’t working 
too well. He figured he’d have a 
better chance of surviving if he 
stayed in the ship alone. But it 
didn’t do him any good. He was 
lost in space, or we’d certainly 
have heard of him.” 

From outside there came the 
sound of a low growl. “It’s Ar- 
kem!” cried Mark. “Now you’ll 
see. Wait till he hears me call his 
name.” 

He ran out, and Sam followed 
slowly. “Don’t expect too much, 
Mark,” he said, almost with pity. 

Mark didn’t hear him. “Ar- 
kem!” he called. “Arkem! Ar- 
kem!” 

The dog was watchful, keeping 
his distance and giving no sign 
of recognition. Sam put his arm 
around his son’s shoulder. 

“Arkem, Arkem! Here, Ar- 
kem!” 

The dog snarled. 

T HERE were tears in the boy’s 
eyes. “He doesn’t know his 
own name! He doesn’t even know 
his own name! Arkem!” 

“It’s no use, Mark, he’s for- 
gotten he ever had a name. I’m 
afraid you’d better give up the 
idea of having him as a pet.” 
“But you can't forget your 
own name!” 

“You can in eight hundred 



years. Yes, Mark, that’s when all 
this happened, eight hundred 
years ago. That’s why the lan- 
guage had to be translated. 
Arkem is immortal. And during 
his long life he’s forgotten not 
only his name, but the master for 
whose sake he was marooned 
here. If Julian Hagstrom were, 
by some miracle, to come back 
to life, I’m sure the dog wouldn’t 
remember him. All he has is a 
vague but strong tie to that heap 
of stones. He no longer knows 
why he’s protecting it. He’s been 
away from live human beings so 
long that his brain is little more 
than a bundle of reflexes and in- 
stincts.” 

“I’ll train him,” said Mark. 
“Sometimes you forget a thing 
at first, but it comes back to you 
later. He’ll remember his name — 
here, Arkem!” 

“It’s no use,” said Sam. “For 
eight hundred years he’s been 
tied to that heap of stones. He’ll 
never remember anything except 
that fact. I’ll get you another dog 
for a pet.” 

“You mean we’re going back 
to Mars or Earth?” 

“Some place like that. Some 
place where there are people. 
Being alone in space is no good 
for you.” 

“Oh, no, Pop, you can’t get rid 
of me like that.” 

“I’m not trying to get rid of 
you,” said Sam. “Being alone in 



72 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



space is no good for me either. 
I’m going with you.” 

“Gee, are you sure? You won’t 
change your mind?” 

The delighted but uncertain 
look on his son’s face shook Sam. 
He said carefully, “I won’t 
change my mind. I’ve decided 
that it’s possible to have too much 
of a good thing. If grief is a good 
thing.” 

Suddenly, for no reason that 
they could detect, the dog barked 
at them and backed away, the 
fur rising in an angry ridge along 
his back. 

“Couldn’t we take him along 
anyway?” asked Mark. “I don’t 
like to think of him all alone 
here, year after year.” 

“He’ll be miserable here, but 



he’d be more miserable away 
from his heap of dirt and stones. 
Perhaps — ” Mark didn’t see as 
Sam pulled his gun, then let it 
slip back into place. “No. That’s 
none of my business. Maybe he’ll 
be fortunate and have an acci- 
dent.” 

“What did you say, Pop?” 

“Nothing much. Come along, 
Mark. We’re heading for civili- 
zation.” 

An hour later, the ship rose 
into the air. Through the blast- 
ing of the rockets, Sam thought — 
imagined, he decided, was a bet- 
ter word — that he heard the long 
doleful whine of a creature whose 
mindless grief was doomed to 
last for all eternity.

By WILLY LEY 



HOW MUCH WATER? 

ABOUT a year ago, I re- 
/_» ceived an inquiry from a 
ZjL reader asking my opin- 
ion about the probable rise of the 
general sea level if the ice of the 
polar caps were melted. I replied 
at that time that, of course, not 
all the water from the melting 
polar caps would go into the 
oceans, but that a good deal of it 



74 



would be tied up by increasing 
the glaciers on mountains, in- 
creasing the size of inland lakes, 
raising the water table every- 
where, etc., etc., and that I would 
not expect a rise of the sea level 
of more than about six meters or 
20 feet. 

Somewhat to my surprise, this 
little item was noticed by a large 
number of people who mentioned 
it, mostly in personal conversa- 
tions, for several months after it 
had appeared. Most of them ex- 
pressed astonishment that the 
figure was so small, a few were 
as pleased with it as if it had 
been an immediate danger, while 
several told me bluntly that I 
had been too conservative in my 
answer. 

One man distinctly remem- 
bered having read somewhere 
that if all the ice on Earth were 
melted, the sea level would rise 
by 6,000 feet. Since I recognized 
this figure, I could write him that 
he remembered only a part of 
what he had read. What this es- 
timate — a fairly old one — really 
said was that if the Earth were 
smoothed out, shoveling all the 
continents into the oceans, as it 
were, and if all the ice were melt- 
ed in the process, our planet 
would be covered with water 
6,000 feet deep. Whether this es- 
timate is correct is a different 
question, which I did not take 
the time to check. 



A NOTHER correspondent 
questioned my statement 
that much of the water would be 
tied up again in glaciers. He ar- 
gued that if the climate grew 
warm enough to melt the polar 
caps, it would also be too warm 
to permit the formation of moun- 
tain glaciers, that those glaciers 
we now have would melt, too. 
This, of course, is correct, but as 
I recall the original letter, an 
artificial melting of the polar caps 
had been in the correspondent’s 
mind, not a subtropical Earth 
from pole to pole. 

But this did not answer the 
critics who had told me that I 
had been too conservative, quot- 
ing from books like Physical 
Geology (by Longwell, Knopf 
and Flint, 3rd ed., 1948) that “it 
is estimated that the complete 
wastage of all the glacier ice ex- 
isting today would return enough 
water to the sea to raise its level 
about 100 feet. This would drown 
vast areas of land, much of it 
densely populated and would 
submerge large parts of such 
cities as New York, Boston, Lon- 
don and Hamburg.” 

The strongest quote came from 
a professional geologist in Berke- 
ley who found that Dr. Ahlmann, 
former professor of geography at 
the University of Stockholm, had 
written that “on the basis of the 
French results in Greenland, 
Andre Cailleux is quite right in 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



75 



saying that previous estimates of 
the world’s existing glacier ice are 
too small. He calculates that the 
total volume of land ice must be 
between 26 and 36 million cubic 
kilometers. Melting of this vol- 
ume of ice would raise the sea 
level by some 65 to 90 meters. 
Even after making allowance for 
isostatic adjustments, the rise 
would be from 43 to 60 meters. 
Now, as a result of the work in 
the Antarctic, we can say that 
the higher figure, 60 meters [197 
feet], is probably a minimum 
value.” 

I conceded to correspondents 
that I might have been too con- 
servative, but just the same I 
made a mental note that one day 
I would try to find out whether 
I actually had been. Pressure of 
other business intervened, but 
when I strolled, one Sunday 
afternoon, through the Chicago 
Museum of Natural History, I 
saw an exhibit which fitted right 
in with this problem. It was 
stated there that the northern 
Greenland ice covered an area of 

637.000 square miles with an av- 
erage thickness of 8,000 feet while 
the polar ice of Antarctica cov- 
ered 5,000,000 square miles with 
an average thickness of 2,000 feet. 

Since 5,000,000 square miles at 

2.000 feet is the same as 1 % mil- 
lion square miles at 8,000 feet, 
the figures also stated that the 
volume of the antarctic ice was 



very nearly twice that of the 
northern ice. And since 8,000 feet 
are just about V /2 miles, it was 
easy to compute that the north- 
ern ice amounted to 955,000 cu- 
bic miles. Since the southern-ice 
was twice as much or 1,910,000 
cubic miles, the polar ice of Earth 
had to be on the order of three 
million cubic miles — considerably 
less than Dr. Ahlmann’s figures. 

T HE total surface of the Earth 
is 196,950,000 square miles. 
For the sake of simplifying the 
calculation, we’ll round this off 
to 200,000,000 square miles. So 
the problem amounts to distrib- 
uting 3,000,000 cubic miles over 
200,000,000 square miles. All you 
have to do is to divide three by 
200. The result is 0.015, which 
means that 1.5 per cent of a mile 
of water would be added, for 1.5 
per cent of a mile is 79.2 feet. 

This figure, of course, is four 
times as high as the one I had 
originally given. Even allowing 
for all the secondary factors, like 
the rise of the water table, the 
increase in area of existing lakes, 
the growth of mountain glaciers, 
the filling up of now dry depres- 
sions in arid areas and, last but 
certainly not least, the increase 
of the average relative humidity 
of the atmosphere, the rise would 
inevitably be greater than I 
stated. 

In short, I had satisfied myself 



76 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



that I had been too conservative. 
Right now, however, I’m afraid 
that I may have to revise my 
opinion once more. Time of May 
17, 1954, carried a short resume 
of a release by Edward L. Cor- 
ton, Jr., of the U. S. Navy Hy- 
drographic Office, dealing with 
the northern ice cap. 

“At present,” it stated, “the 
pack contains only 6,500 cubic 
miles of ice (barely enough to 
cover the state of Texas with a 
125-foot layer) and it is steadily 
shrinking.” This is just about 
0.68 per cent of the figure for 
the northern ice which I had been 
using. 

Apparently earlier researchers 
had been enormously misled by 
too few and too hasty measure- 
ments in a few spots and had 
greatly overestimated the amount 
of ice in the north. If that figure 
is correct, the melting of the 
northern ice alone would be just 
about 18 inches of additional 
water, while the southern ice by 
itself would contribute some 52 
feet — if the figure of 5,000,000 
square miles at an average of 
2,000 feet of ice is correct. 

But is it? 

AN UNKNOWN REPTILE 
IN WEST TEXAS? 

M Y short piece on “Europe’s 
Unknown Poisonous Liz- 
ard” brought me two interesting 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



letters. One came from an Amer- 
ican officer stationed in Bavaria 
who wrote that he had heard this 
animal mentioned, though he 
unfortunately had not seen it 
himself. 

The other letter came from a 
Mr. W. E. Crutcher, now of 
Phoenix, Arizona, who topped 
my story with a tale of what 
might be an unknown reptile in 
West Texas. 

“Some years ago,” he wrote, 
“when I was traveling West 
Texas for manufacturers, I was 
driving on U. S. Highway 84 be- 
tween Snyder and Roscoe, 
through moderately hilly coun- 
try. Without warning, a creature 
ran across the pavement in front 
of my car and disappeared into 
the underbrush on the other side 
of the road. The experience was 
startling, to say the least, since I 
had never before seen anything 
quite like it. 

“I have looked in a number of 
reference books to identify the 
animal — the reptile, to be more 
specific. It looked almost exactly 
like a miniature Tyrannosaurus 
and I would estimate its standing 
height at about three feet. In the 
short time I had to observe it, I 
couldn’t determine too much de- 
tail. Its overall color was a light 
green, something between a lime 
and a chartreuse. It ran as a man 
runs, one leg before the other, 
holding its front legs loosely in 

77 



front of its chest, with tail almost 
erect . 

“I stopped for gasoline and in- 
quired of the station proprietor 
as to the name of the critter. He 
identified it rather readily as a 
‘Mountain Boomer’ and men- 
tioned that he had seen them in 
his youth. He also said that if 
you ‘chowsed’ one of them (made 
as if you were going to attack it), 
it would run at you, hissing loud- 
ly. Those are about all the details 
that I can recall at this time, ex- 
cept that the gas station man 
‘believed’ that it was poisonous.” 

My correspondent was con- 
vinced that the reptile he had 
seen was known, if probably rare, 
and asked for identification. 
What struck me most was the 
name Mountain Boomer. Only 
about a year ago, while looking 
for something else, I had found 
an old magazine article in which 
its author complained that no- 
body believed his truthful re- 
ports about a noise-making 
gigantic lizard in West Texas. 

¥>UT first I wrote back to Mr. 
■*-* Crutcher, naming various 
reptiles known to run on their 
hind legs occasionally, adding 
that most of them are not sup- 
posed to occur any farther north 
than Mexico, but that an occa- 
sional “wetback” does not seem 
impossible, even though I did not 
know of any actual cases. I also 



told where he could find pictures 
of them. 

He replied that none of them 
fitted his memory, though a re- 
construction of an extinct saurian 
came fairly close: “If you’ll look 
at vol. VII, p. 391 of the 1948 
edition of the Encyclopaedia Bri- 
tannica, you’ll find a panel de- 
picting twelve dinosaurs, figure 
6 is Podokesaurus. Now, if you 
shorten the neck about half and 
reduce the tail about 60 per cent, 
fatten the standing legs a bit and 
erect the body so that the back- 
bone is vertical or even inclining 
to the rear a slight bit, you have 
a pretty close approximation of a 
Mountain Boomer.” 

The letter went on to say: “I 
was able to determine the date as 
January 18, 1950. I note that I 
filled with gas at Colorado City 
on that date . and I am sure 
now that the sighting actually 
took place between Snyder and 
Colorado City on State Highway 
101 instead of U. S. 84, not too 
far from the town of Dunn.” 

While this letter was in the 
mails, I refreshed my memory 
about the magazine article men- 
tioned earlier. It can be found in 
the German monthly Kosmos for 
1907 and was written by a man 
who referred to himself as “an 
old German Texan.” His name 
was H. J. Richarz and he died in 
San Antonio where he apparently 
lived, off and on, most of his life. 



78 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



His memories dated back to the 
“early 1850s” and he stated that 
the lizard, at that time, occurred 
in the canyons of the Frio, Nue- 
ces and Devil’s rivers. 

Specifically, he wrote, he had 
heard the lizard (or iguana) call 
“or more properly whine” during 
a hunting trip “to the upper Seco 
and Rondo, accompanied by Dr. 
Wisselberg and Joe Ney.” Mr. 
H. J. Richarz had supplied Prof. 
Ward of Rochester, N. Y., with 
Texan animals, but when he 
wrote of this reptile, Prof. Ward 
had proved skeptical and replied 
cautiously: “A crying or whin- 
ing variety of lizards or iguanas 
would be of great scientific inter- 
est. But I have to doubt your 
assertion until you send me a 
specimen.” 

Mr. Richarz never did, but at 
a later date (about 1880, as can 
be inferred from his article), his 
son shot one and sent the head 
to his father, who said that it was 
like that of an iguana, about four 
inches long, that the scales were 
“a dirty silvery white, with a 
black ring around the neck im- 
mediately behind the head.” 

Well, that, to my regret, is all 
the available data. What ties the 
two reports, a century apart in 
time, together is the locality and 
the noise-making habit as specifi- 
cally mentioned in one case and 
implied in the name of the ani- 
mal of the second report. Do we 



deal here with unusual behavior 
of something otherwise known or 
is it actually a still unknown 
reptile? 

ANY QUESTIONS? 

Would the gravity he notice- 
ably weaker at the equator than 
at the poles due to centrifugal 
force? 

Jim Caughran 

3110 South 44 th St. 

Lincoln 6, Nebraska 

Since the movement of a 
point of the equator is just 
about 1,000 miles per hour, 
there is a noticeable difference 
in gravitational acceleration, us- 
ually called attraction. It does 
not matter in practice when the 
weights under consideration are 
relatively small, say 100 lbs. or 
so. But if you weighed a whole 
shipload of material on spring 
scales, you’d find a fair amount 
of “shrinkage.” The precise fig- 
ures are as follows, expressed in 
centimeters per second, squar- 
ed: 

at the pole 983.13 

at 45° 980.61 

at equator 978.10 

To find the figure for any lat- 
itude L, the following formula 
is used: (1-0.0025935 times 
cosine of 2 L) multiplied by the 
figure for 45 degrees of latitude.

I have read that over 99% of 
all stars are in spectral classes 
O, B, A, F, G, K and M, the re- 
maining 1% belonging to other 
spectral classes. Would you de- 
scribe them, please? 

Donald Simpson

Modesto, Calif. 

The letters attached to the 
spectral classes of the stars are 
indications of their surface tem- 
peratures. The O-type stars are 
the hottest and the temperature 
decreases as you progress 
through the sentence, Oh, Be A 
Fine Girl, Kiss Me Right Now, 
Sweetheart. Specifically, in de- 
grees centigrade:

The S stars, of course, are the 
coldest. For finer distinctions, 
a number is added to the let- 
ter — K3 would mean, for ex- 
ample, that the star is colder 
than a K, namely 3/10th of the 
difference in the direction of 
M. R5 would mean halfway be- 
tween R and N. 



I have two questions: (1) what 
is the dividing line between a 



planet and a moon? I have read 
that some of Jupiter’s moons are 
almost as large as the planet 
Mercury. Has the dividing line 
been picked so that Mercury is 
just above and Jupiter's moons 
just below? My second question 
is this : just what is a comet? I 
have never seen one. 

Name Withheld 

Red Bank, N. J. 

There is no “dividing line” 
between planets and moons in 
regard to size. It would he qliite 
possible for a moon to be far 
bigger than a planet (hut not, 
of course, its planet) because 
the distinction lies in the move- 
ment. Bodies moving around 
the Sun are planets; bodies 
moving around a planet are 
moons. 

Just to clean up loose ends 
at this point, I wish to add that 
a “moon of a moon” is a theo- 
retical possibility, though we 
don’t seem to have any in our 
solar system. If a moon and 
“its” planet should be of fairly 
equal size, one would probably 
refer to them as a “double 
planet.” Since the Earth-Moon 
system approaches this condi- 
tion, some authors have used 
the term “double planet” for 
Earth and Moon. 

I do not agree with this usage 
because the common center of 
gravity of the Earth-Moon sys- 
tem is still inside the Earth. 



80 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Double planet,” in my opin- 
ion, should be used only if the 
common center of gravity is 
somewhere between the sur- 
faces of the two bodies. 

As for comets, there are a 
few every year, but all since the 
last appearance of Halley’s 
comet have been quite small; 
that is to say, telescopic. The 
few large enough to be visible 
to the naked eye were absolute- 
ly unspectacular. 

The comets move around the 
Sun like the planets, but their 
orbits are highly elongated el- 
lipses while those of the planets 
are nearly circular ellipses. 

The behavior and appear- 
ance of the comets has been ex- 
plained by Dr. Fred L. Whipple 
of Harvard Observatory by as- 
suming that a comet consists 
essentially of frozen gases of 
various kinds, mostly such sim- 
ple substances as carbon diox- 
ide, water and ammonia. Some 
solid matter (dust particles) is 
probably imbedded in this mix- 
ture. As the comet approaches 
the Sun, the frozen gases evapo- 
rate, forming first the so-called 
“coma” of the comet and then 
its tail. 

According to Van Nostrand’s 
Scientific Encyclopedia, the 
White Dwarf star 0 2 Eridani B 
has a sf. cific gravity, or density 
in terms of water, of 64,000. I 



would like to know how this is 
possible when the heaviest ele- 
ments on Earth have densities of 
only slightly higher than 20. 

Charles Husted 

2609 Arnott 

San Diego 17, Calif. 

The explanation for the wide 
discrepancy between the densi- 
ties of the heaviest elements 
found on Earth and the densi- 
ties of the White Dwarf stars 
lies in the fact that terrestrial 
matter is always composed of 
“complete atoms” while the 
matter of the White Dwarfs is 
not. Each terrestrial atom con- 
sists of a nucleus, composed of 
protons and neutrons, which is 
surrounded by a number of 
electrons. The electrons move 
around the nucleus in so-called 
“shells” at various definite dis- 
tances. 

Under any normal pressure 
which may occur on Earth and 
even under laboratory pres- 
sures obtained so far, the forces 
holding the atom together are 
strong enough to resist any at- 
tempt to squeeze the electron 
shells of one atom into the elec- 
tron shells of the neighboring 
atom. 

It is for this reason that 
liquids and solids are virtually 
incompressible. But there must 
be a limit to the resistance the 
electron shells of an atom can 
offer. If the external pressure is 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



81 



large enough, it must be pos- 
sible to crush the electron 
shells. 

This, astrophysicists have de- 
duced, is what happened in the 
White Dwarfs. If you consider 
such “crushed matter,” as it is 
called, you realize that there is 
no longer any meaning to the 
word “atom.” You no longer 
have atoms, but a mixture of 
atomic nuclei and unattached 
electrons, probably free neu- 
trons, too. Because there are no 
whole atoms left, there can no 
longer be any great resistance 
against outside pressures so 
that matter, once crushed, can 
be compressed still more with 
relative ease. 

Compressibility is normally 
the characteristic of a gas and 
crushed matter (although it 
probably would look like mol- 
ten iron) must, therefore, be 
considered a gas. Since Enrico 
Fermi was the first to investi- 
gate the theory of crushed mat- 
ter, this entirely unexpected 
new state of matter is often re- 
ferred to as a Fermi gas. 

I recently looked through an 
astronomical book for the diam- 
eter of the Moon. 

I found it all right, but at the 
bottom of one page I saw some- 
thing which was not explained. 
It said: January 1st, 1950 A.D. 
— J.D. 2,433,283. 



What does that mean? 

C. F. Weinstein 
Kansas City, Mo. 

The letters J.D. stand for Jul- 
ian Day. This is a method, used 
almost exclusively by astrono- 
mers, to pin down a date with- 
out reference to the year. 
Especially when it comes to 
B. C. dates, you always have to 
remember that 1 A.D. followed 
immediately after 1 B.C., 

though logically one should ex- 
pect a year zero (namely, the 
year of the birth of Christ) be- 
tween them. 

In addition to this difficulty 
there have been, as you have 
read in last month’s column, 
several revisions of the calen- 
dar which would have to be 
taken into consideration. 

To avoid all these difficulties, 
one Joseph Scaliger, quite some 
time ago, suggested simply 
counting days, without refer- 
ence to months or years. To 
make this scheme workable, 
one had to start at a very early 
arbitrary date and Scaliger 
chose January 1st, 4713 B.C. 
He also suggested calling the 
days counted from that date 
the Julian Days. This has noth- 
ing to do with Julius Caesar and 
the Julian calendar, but was 
meant to honor Joseph Scali- 
ger’s father Julius. 

The Julian Day 2,429,630 is 
the first of January, 1940; the 



82 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



figure you happened across is 
the J.D. number for the first day 
of 1950. Since the J. D. is used 
chiefly hy astronomers, it does 
not begin at midnight, because 
that may change the J. D. in the 
middle of an observation. The 
Julian Day consequently begins 
at noon. 

Why is a salamander called an 
amphibian like a frog, but a liz- 
ard is called a reptile like a tur- 
tle? Does it have anything to do 
with whether they live in water 
or on land? 

Morris Moore 

Philadelphia, Pa. 

Yes, it does have something 
to do with where they live, but 
the connection is not that sim- 
ple. The word “amphibian” 
comes from amphi (both) and 
bios (life) and means that such 
animals live both in water 
(fresh water only) and on land 
in the course of their lives. The 
best and also best-known exam- 



ple is the frog, which is hatched 
in water, goes through a tad- 
pole stage and then climbs up 
on land where it may spend the 
rest of its life, going back into 
the water only for mating. The 
marine turtles (reptiles) do the 
opposite; they spend all their 
lives in the seas and crawl back 
on land only to lay their eggs. 

More specifically, amphibi- 
ans have gills when immature 
and lungs later, although a few 
of them retain the gills all their 
lives. Amphibians also have a 
soft skin equipped with skin 
glands, which may be the reason 
why no salt-water amphibian is 
known. Reptiles have lungs and 
a skin covered with scales and 
without skin glands and are es- 
sentially land animals, even 
though some, like the marine 
turtles, the marine iguana of 
the Galapagos islands and the 
sea snakes of the Indian Ocean, 
have chosen to return to the 
ocean.

OPEN HOUSE 



By J. T. MclNTOSH 



When Earth gave a housewarm- 
ing, the Visitors brought the gifts 
. but who would get the gate? 

Illustrated by SENTZ 



N OBODY saw the Visitors 
come, nobody saw them 
go, and when they were 
gone nobody could describe them, 
except as ordinary-looking peo- 
ple. But there was never any 
doubt that they had been. They 
left plenty of evidence. 

They didn’t go in for high- 
power salesmanship while they 
were here. They didn’t have to. 
All they had to do was show 
their various gadgets for us to 
want— ^and we wanted. 

“Like donkeys with carrots 
hung in front of their noses,” Un- 
cle Egbert sniffed. We did ex- 



actly what the Visitors wanted 
so quickly and with so little 
trouble that they must have 
thought we were dumb indeed. 

There was some excuse for us, 
when you consider the gadgets. 
Mighty Atoms, then matoms, . 
they came to be called, these 
gadgets — if you can call a power 
station in a matchbox a gadget, 
or a flying-belt, or a seven- 
million-word library the size of a 
pocketbook, or a suit which you 
could pack away in a thimble. 

We needed a whole new dic- 
tionary of words for the matoms. 
Most of them were portmanteau 



84 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



words. When things for which the 
Greeks hadn’t a word come along 
one at a time, the people who 
make the languages have time to 
think up smart new names. But 
if they come out in a flood, as the 
matoms did, names for them 
have to come out in a flood too, or 
you’d have things without names 
at all, which would never do. 

The seven-million-word li- 
brary was really a microfilm con- 
tainer and projector, so it was 
called first MCAP and then mi- 
cap. The power station in a 
matchbox was supposed to be a 
receiver picking up solar power 
from an automatic master plant 
set up inside Mercury’s orbit. So 
the visitors said, anyway. Uncle 
Egbert said, “Hah!” explosively. 

It was all very farfetched and 
we knew there must be a catch 
in it somewhere, but we called the 
things sopos — sopo for solar 
power. The suits which would go 
in thimbles needed different 
names for each variety — Aims, 
duples and minpas (minpa for 
multum in parvo ). 

A FTER the Visitors had gone, 
*"*■ nobody seemed to know 
much about them, even what 
they looked like. I had an idea 
they were small people, dressed 
in dark clothes, but Thea said 
they were medium-sized and only 
some of them wore dark clothes. 
Considering that the things they 



brought were so much more in- 
teresting than they were, it was- 
n’t really surprising that we did- 
n’t remember much about the 
Visitors themselves. It was irk- 
some, though, that we didn’t even 
have a name for them, or know 
whether they came from outer 
space, or up through holes in the 
ground. 

But it seemed (at first) to be 
going a bit far to suggest, as some 
romancers did, that it was in- 
credible that so little should be 
remembered or known of the Vis- 
itors unless they had used some 
form of mass hypnosis on us. 
There was no need for such a 
wild explanation. The things the 
Visitors brought had naturally 
claimed our full attention. If Spe- 
cial Delivery suddenly deposited 
Marilyn Monroe on your door- 
step, you wouldn’t remember 
much about the delivery men, 
would you? 

This sort of argument was what 
we called being reasonable. 

We remembered what had hap- 
pened, all right — how the Visitors 
had shown us their whole dazz- 
ling array of matoms; how we’d 
tried to buy them; how we found 
that the idea really seemed to 
shock the Visitors. They couldn’t 
possibly sell us matoms — nor ex- 
change them for anything we had, - 
for that came to the same thing, 
apparently. 

“Why not?” Uncle Egbert ask- 



OPEN HOUSE 



85 




86 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ed some of them bluntly once. 

“It’s against the regulations,” 
they said. “Values differ . 

“But you obviously want to 
sell these things,” he pointed out. 

“Who told you? How do you 
know?” 

“Look,” Uncle Egbert said dis- 
gustedly, “you come and open 
your case and show us your 
goods. Obviously you want to 
sell them, or anyway you want 
us to have them on some terms, 
for some reason.” 

Private committee meeting. 
Then: “This is obvious to you, 
but not to everybody. You are 
a genius, perhaps?” 

It was no new idea to Uncle 
Egbert. Nor was the opposite 
point of view, that nobody who 
was related to Thea could pos- 
sibly be a genius. He’s Thea’s 
Uncle Egbert, by the way, not 
mine. 

We didn’t find the exchange 
medium then, but Thea, of all 
people, found it soon afterward. 
She came in crowing with delight 
and wearing a snazzy Aim play- 
suit. 

After I’d picked up my eyes 
and put them back in their sock- 
ets, I asked Thea how she got it. 

“I’d have done anything for 
such a lovely thing,” said Thea, 
staring down at herself in awe 
and rapture. She looked up, 
caught my eye, and faltered, 
“Bu — but I didn’t have to, of 



course. They just gave me it.” 

For a moment I was jealous, 
unreasonable, on the point of hit- 
ting the roof, as jealous lovers al- 
ways are, but Uncle Egbert told 
me to keep the head and asked 
derisively if I thought Thea had 
the brains to tell a lie. 

That was unanswerable. I was 
never jealous again. It was ridic- 
ulous to suggest that Thea could 
deceive me, even if she wanted to. 

She was vague about how she 
had got the playsuit, but we 
gathered that all she’d had to do 
was say things until, by a process 
of trial and error, she said what 
the Visitors wanted. 

“That’s all right so long as you 
didn’t sign anything,” said Uncle 
Egbert, with relief. 

A ND presently we learned for 
ourselves how to get the ma- 
toms. That was the bit when we 
acted like donkeys with carrots 
hung in front of their noses. The 
Visitors had a sort of verbal con- 
tract they led us through, and 
we, with our eyes on the carrots, 
gabbled what was necessary with- 
out paying much attention to 
what we were saying. 

“Though when you do pay at- 
tention,” Uncle Egbert observed, 
“it doesn’t seem to make much 
difference. You have to say very 
definitely that you want the thing 
in question, that you won’t be 
happy until you get it, that you 



OPEN HOUSE 



87 



don’t understand how it was 
made, that you don’t think you 
ever will understand, and that 
you only want the item to use it, 
not to take it apart. You don’t 
have to promise anything or 
agree to anything. I don’t see the 
point.” 

The Visitors seemed to think 
we’d all want sopos, but as Thea 
said, “Who’d go wild over sopos 
when we have power points where 
we want them anyway? But gee, 
those Aims! I’d have given my 
back teeth for one outfit — if I’d 
had to, that is.” 

The demand for Aims, duples 
and minpas took the Visitors by 
surprise. They’d been ready with 
sopos, flelts (flying belts), mi- 
caps, E-motors (eternal motors 
that ran off solar power) -and a 
dozen other gadgets whose pur- 
pose they had to explain. The 
spu (a little thing that looked 
like a model of human intestines, 
which they explained was a 
spaceship propulsion unit), the 
iplar (interplanetary radio) and 
the borer (a drill with a complete- 
ly indestructible tip, the size of a 
suitcase). 

Cereainly there were some tak- 
ers, chiefly teen-agers, but in the 
main hardly anyone wanted mi- 
caps, let alone spus, iplars and 
borers. 

“What use is a spaceship pro- 
pulsion unit without a space- 
ship?” Uncle Egbert asked once. 



“It’s the only bit you can’t 
make yourself,” the Visitors said. 

“Bit of what?” Uncle Egbert 
asked. 

“Bit of a spaceship,” they told 
him. 

“But I don’t want a spaceship,” 
he replied. 

That took their breath away. 
Apparently it was utterly dum- 
founding to them that Uncle Eg- 
bert didn’t want a spaceship. 

However, when they produced 
their marvelous textiles, equally 
marvelously conceived, designed 
and tailored, everyone was excit- 
ed — the women over the clothes, 
and the men over the prospect of 
women wearing them. The Visi- 
tors did try matom clothes for 
men, but they never caught on. 

f I ’HE Aims were one-piece gar- 
-*■ ments — swimsuits, pajamas 
or nightgowns, as strong and 
opaque as the usual variety, but 
each with the substance of about 
one-tenth of one silk stocking. 
Since they were strong and 
opaque, they were wearable. 
They must have been, for mil- 
lions of women wore them, gen- 
erally after having said they 
couldn’t possibly, but being about 
the thickness of a coat of paint, 
they were a trifle sensational in 
other respects. 

“That’s the only way,” Uncle 
Egbert observed dispassionately, 
the first time he saw Thea in a 



88 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Aim swimsuit, “that a girl can be 
naked while wearing something. 
Having some knowledge of your 
sex, I’ve no doubt full advantage 
will be taken of the phenomenon 
— to the ruination of weak charac- 
ters like Jacky here.” 

“Like it?” asked Thea coyly, 
putting the Aim and Thea on 
display with four seductive, 
simultaneous Aections of elbows 
and knees. 

I opened my mouth, but not 
to say anything, only to let out 
the steam. 

T HE duples and minpas 
brought in another principle. 
Take a duple evening gown. 
For the Arst time in history, a girl 
could be comparatively warm on 
her way to a social function in 
December, wearing only an eve- 
ning dress. For, though her outfit 
still had next to no substance, 
there were ten insulating layers 
of air in it. Or in spring, or even 
winter, a girl could go out in a 
temperature of forty or under, 
wearing what looked like a sum- 
mer dress with little or nothing 
underneath it, although it was 
actually a complete outfit incor- 
porating twenty-six layers of 
air . 

Yes, the Visitors seemed puz- 
zled when we fell on the sheer, 
trick clothes with delight and 
showed little or no interest, for 
the most part, in spaceship drives, 



interplanetary radio and portable 
power stations. 

It wasn’t entirely that we did- 
n’t believe these things were 
spaceship drives and so on. We 
could try out the sopos and fielts 
in two minutes and see that there 
was no hoax about them. The 
Visitors must have thought we 
were dumb, going for the mirrors 
and strings of beads instead of 
the genuine tin alarm-clocks . 

Yet, were we? Uncle Egbert 
isn’t so sure. He tells the old story 
of the boy who, offered a shiny 
new penny or a dirty old nickel, 
would invariably take the penny. 
This happened time and again. 
When at last his sister begged 
him to stop being so dumb, dis- 
gracing the family, he pointed out 
that if he’d taken the nickel that 
would have been the end of the 
experiment. Instead he’d already 
made over a quarter in pennies . 

Maybe it was like that to a 
certain extent. Thea got a Aim 
swimsuit, nightdress and two 
pairs of pajamas, two duple eve- 
ning dresses and summer frocks 
and half a dozen assorted minpa 
outfits — winter suits, a riding 
habit and a skating costume. 
While she was amassing this col- 
lection of sartorial miracles, she 
also acquired, incidentally, a 
sopo, a micap, a fielt and an iplar. 

True, she didn’t appreciate 
them. When we got married, 
much later — the Visitors were 



OPEN HOUSE 



89 



gone by this time — she asked if 
we should bother keeping all this 
junk. Thea, I should mention, 
is a mechanical moron . but 
perhaps I’ve implied that al- 
ready. 

Anyway, it was there, that’s 
the point, appreciated or other- 
wise. 

A FTER the Visitors had gone, 
we were left looking a little 
dazedly at what they’d left be- 
hind. Then we really started to 
use it. What was the point of 
hydro-electric power schemes 
when all that was needed was a 
network of wire and a sopo? 
Who was going to be first to 
build a ship around a spu and 
get to the Moon, Mars, Venus? 
What would the interplanetary 
commercial radio rights be worth? 
Could iplars be adapted for TV? 

“You know,” said Uncle Eg- 
bert thoughtfully, “I think our 
recent callers went away with 
quite a wrong idea of us. They 
knew all about our first thoughts, 
the Aims, duples and minpas, but 
they didn’t wait for our second 
thoughts . .” 

Almost as quickly as it started, 
the Aim craze died. We knew 
how to make them now so the 
novelty was gone. It was like 
bikinis a few years back — having 
gone as far as possible in one di- 
rection, we could only turn and 
go the other way. Duples re- 



mained, because they were prac- 
tical. The minpa principle con- 
tinued to be used, but what we 
knew as minpas disappeared. 

“It doesn’t look right,” Thea 
argued, “and it doesn’t feel right, 
either. I mean, minpas do keep 
you warm, but you expect to be 
wrapped up when there’s snow 
on the ground, not looking like 
you’re on your way to a picnic.” 

This, for Thea, was high-power 
thinking. 

Gradually we emerged from 
the fog. No photographs existed 
of the Visitors, which was almost 
incredible. There must have been 
a first contact, when we asked 
who they were, where they’d 
come from and what they wanted. 
There must have been ships. We 
must have noticed and followed 
up clues of the Visitors’ nature, 
origin, purpose, unless . 

Unless the farfetched idea that 
we had rejected at first was true 
after all, and there had been some 
form of mass hypnosis. 

“You can fool all of the peo- 
ple for some of the time,” de- 
clared Uncle Egbert, “but false 
ideas are like cuts — they heal, 
eventually.” 

So we gradually began to real- 
ize that the Visitors had deliber- 
ately prevented us from learning 
anything about them and, in gen- 
eral, had done with us exactly 
what they wanted. Which was, 
apparently, to leave us with the 



90 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



matoms and only the most vague 
ideas of how we had got them, 
and from whom. 

“They’re nice people, then,” 
said Thea warmly. “Missionaries 
— that’s it. They came to help 
us and to give us things.” 

Uncle Egbert frowned. “I 
thought that myself until now,” 
he admitted. “But if you think 
so, Thea, that can’t be right.” 

TF we looked up the back issues 
of the newspapers, we found 
the Visitors mentioned often 
enough, but no more information 
than we remembered. If what we 
remembered could be censored, 
it wasn’t really surprising that 
what we had written at the time 
had been censored, too. 

And it became clear that the 
contract, or whatever it was — 
the terms on which they had 
given us the matoms — must be 
important. 

“We had to say that we really 
wanted them,” Uncle Egbert 
mused. “That we couldn’t see 
how they were made, that we did- 
n’t think we ever would, and that 
we wanted to use the things, not 
take them apart. But what guar- 
antee could the Visitors have had 
that we meant what we said? We 
didn’t, anyway. What’s the good 
of getting us to say anything 
that they can’t enforce? If there’s 
anything there to enforce, which 
there isn’t . .” 

OPEN HOUSE 



He was quite annoyed about it 
all, taking it as an insult to him- 
self personally. 

“Don’t worry about it, Uncle 
Egbert,” said Thea cheerfully. 
“It doesn’t bother me at all.” 
“It won’t beat me,” said Uncle 
Egbert furiously. “I’ll make sense 
out of it, somehow.” 

He didn’t get the chance. A 
newspaper columnist maliciously 
forestalled him, pointing out that 
from the circumstances of the 
handing over of the matoms, the 
declaration the Visitors had in- 
sisted on could only be a cover 
for them, not a promise or un- 
dertaking by us. 

“Of course, of course!” Uncle 
Egbert said when he read it, 
stamping about and raging be- 
cause he hadn’t thought of it first. 
“I should have known. That Visi- 
tor talked about regulations, 
about values being different. He 
didn’t mean economic values, he 
meant ethical values. Naturally 
their ethics are different from 
ours. They weren’t supposed to 
sell us the matoms, but they 
could give them under those 
conditions.” 

W ELL, it took Uncle Egbert 
and the rest of the world a 
long time to reach a final deci- 
sion on what the Visitors had 
been doing, and why. But slow- 
ly, step by step, they managed it. 
What they decided between them 

91 



was something like this: 

We on Earth were a pretty 
backward race, compared with 
the Visitors, judging by the ma- 
toms. And perhaps they had 
merely been extending a helping 
hand . perhaps. 

What would happen if you gave 
savages howitzers and machine- 
guns? If you went back to pre- 
historic and made Neanderthal 
Man a present of the atom bomb? 
If you let Eighteenth- Century 
doctors use penicillin, b.c.g., sul- 
phonamides, streptomycin and 
the rest of Twentieth -Century 
materia medica? 

Well, what would happen? 
Could you call it any less than 
disaster? 

No, the Visitors hadn’t been 
extending a helping hand. 

Ignorance isn’t always a bad 
thing. The savages, Neanderthal 
Man and Eighteenth-Century 
doctors were protected by their 
own ignorance. 

Postulate a big galactic organi- 
zation that was very strict about 
what contact could be made with 
non-member races artd what 
couldn’t, and exploiters sneaking 
in under the ban with cute 
schemes to get around the galac- 
tic regulations . and what we 
knew began to make sense. 

Not to Thea, naturally. She 
stared at Uncle Egbert as if he 
had suddenly turned green. “But 
you’ve always been so clever!" 



she exclaimed. “I never thought 
you'd be taken in by tripe like 
that, Uncle Egbert.” 

“I wish it were tripe,” Uncle 
Egbert declared bitterly. “On the 
contrary, it’s a very sound idea to 
hand out rifles to savages so that 
they’ll exterminate each other 
without forcing you to mur- 
der them and violate your high 
ethical principles. Very sound in- 
deed.” 

“Rifles?” said Thea, puzzled. 

“Well, perhaps not rifles,” Un- 
cle Egbert admitted. “The Visi- 
tors were more subtle than that. 
They handed out power, not 
rifles. Power to make things much 
more destructive than rifles. 
Power to fuse a million wires, 
set factories and towns on fire. 
Later, power to go to the Moon, 
to the planets. Power to make 
bigger and better mistakes. 
Power that mankind doesn’t 
know how to handle, and won’t 
have time to learn to handle be- 
fore it proves fatal. 

“Ignorance is a powerful pro- 
tection, a very powerful protec- 
tion indeed. The caveman could- 
n’t stumble on the secret of the 
atom bomb — he could only learn 
how to make fire. That might 
lead to the hydrogen bomb a few 
thousand years later, but the roll- 
ing stone would have gathered a 
lot of moss on the way . ex- 
planatory, protective moss.” 

“Say, Uncle Egbert,” said 



92 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Thea, concerned, “you’d better 
get to bed right away. Gee, yes, 
your brow feels hot, right 
enough.” 

¥>UT you couldn’t stop Uncle 
Egbert as easily as that, not 
when he was properly wound up. 
“The galactic organization knows 
all about that,” he went on, his 
powerful enough voice rising to 
a roar, “so our ingenious friends 
come along and get us to give 
them an excuse. The excuse that 
we don’t understand the matonjp, 
and never will, and want them 
only to use them as individual 
items. Certainly not to take them 
apart and try to find how they 
work . no, not that. They’ll be 
able to say, later, that we said 
that and they believed it. 

“Then they hand out matoms, 
knowing that when they come 
back in a few years the rather 
backward people who live on 
Earth will have destroyed them- 
selves or at least destroyed their 
civilization and returned to sav- 
agery. It’s inevitable — it’s abso- 
lutely inevitable as long as hu- 
man beings are human beings.” 

His face purple, he bawled his 
peroration: “Then, of course, 

they can take what they want, 
enslave Earth and set the iron 
heel of the conqueror on it for 
ever!” 

Uncle Egbert, to do him jus- 
tice, did say all this before it 



was the general, established point 
of view on what the Visitors had 
been, done and intended. It took 
about five years, but in the end 
everybody agreed with Uncle Eg- 
bert. He was a prophet, unsung, 
and without honor in his own 
country. 

We found what had kept us 
from seeing the Visitors properly, 
and all the other things they had- 
n’t wanted us to see. Something 
in the design of the micap, a sort 
of concentration booster, suggest- 
ed the interference field that jams 
the perception and awareness 
centers and enables skillful op- 
erators to make people believe 
they’ve seen the Indian rope 
trick or anything else. Soon we 
could use it ourselves, and thus 
could guess how the Visitors must 
have used it. 

We soon managed to tape 
some of the power the matoms 
represented. Most of Chicago was 
blown up in one experiment, and 
a chunk of Southern Italy in an- 
other. Forty-seven factories in 
North America alone were de- 
stroyed before we learned enough 
about solar power to be able to 
use it safely. 

“I tell you,” said Uncle Eg- 
bert, “it’s only a matter of time.” 

There was extensive damage in 
Las Vegas, not caused by solar 
power this time, but by spu ex- 
periments. 

“Why do people do these things 



OPEN HOUSE 



93 



if they’re so dangerous?” Thea 
wondered. 

“Have you ever,” inquired 
Uncle Egbert grimly, “heard the 
story of Adam and Eve? You 
know, for thousands of years that 
story has been willfully misin- 
terpreted. I don’t think it has 
any sexual significance or that 
Eve tempted Adam matters 
much. No, what it really means 
is this. If you put down in the 
middle of a desert, a box marked 
in huge letters DON’T TOUCH, 
in five minutes it’ll be surround- 
ed by hordes of people fighting to 
get close enough to touch it. 
That's why people do these 
things, though they’re so danger- 
ous. That's why the matoms are 
going to be the end of us.” 

I T was not to be expected that 
Thea could follow that. She 
had just become a mother, rather 
to her surprise. She had no illu- 
sions about her own intelligence, 
and she’d always had a vague 
idea that it took brains to de- 
liver a child. Where she picked 
that one up, I couldn’t say. Per- 
haps someone who was jealous 
of her looks had said it. 

The first man duly landed on 
the Moon. Unfortunately he 
landed much too hard and cre- 
ated another crater. Others fol- 
lowed him; three before anybody 
landed gently, four before any- 
one landed and got off again, five 



before anyone landed, got off 
again and returned on Earth 
safely. 

“By landing on Earth safely,” 
Uncle Egbert grunted, “he’s ac- 
complished only what he would 
have achieved if he’d never gone.” 
But that was Uncle Egbert in 
his most reactionary mood, refus- 
ing to admit that merely doing 
something which hadn’t been 
done before was progress. 

After the Moon, Mars was 
easier. Venus was a waste of 
time. Someone took a dangerous 
dive close to the Sun and found 
it was true what the Visitors had 
said about the sopos . there 
was a master plant set up in- 
side Mercury’s orbit. At least 
there was something. Terran 
spaceships weren’t nearly good 
enough yet to get inside Mer- 
cury’s orbit — and out again. 

The nations started bickering 
about possessions on the Moon 
and on Mars. There were threats 
at various times to drop sopo 
bombs on Washington, Berlin, 
London, Paris and Moscow. Half 
a dozen cold wars were going on 
at the same time, and the pros- 
pects of at least one of them 
breaking out into a hot war ap- 
peared excellent. 

“I wonder when the Visitors 
intend coming back,” Uncle Eg- 
bert ruminated. “It’s an interest- 
ing question. If they come too 
soon, they may arrive right in 



94 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the middle of our sopo war in- 
stead of after it, when we’re 
scrabbling about in the ruins — ” 

“War? You don’t think there’s 
going to be a war, do you, Uncle 
Egbert?” Thea exclaimed, star- 
tled. It was apparently the first 
time the idea had occurred to 
her. She was about the only per- 
son in the world in that position. 

“War’s the least of it,” he 
grunted. “Look at it this way. 
Children are viciously destruc- 
tive sometimes. Haven’t you ever 
noticed Jacky and Meredith 
fighting?” Thea and I had repro- 
duced ourselves successfully a 
second time and there were ru- 
mors of a third happy event. 
Jacky was four and Meredith 
two and a half, and they fought 
like two five-year-olds. They 
had inherited beauty and health 
from Thea and a modicum of in- 
telligence from me. 

“Well, if Jacky decides to an- 
nihilate Meredith,” Uncle Eg- 
bert went on, “no real harm is 
done, because he can’t. But imag- 
ine if Jacky had a magic ring 
that would do anything he want- 
ed as soon as he wanted it done. 
Do you think Meredith would 
last long?” 

“No,” said Thea decidedly. 
“He wouldn’t.” 

“The matoms were magic 
rings,” said Uncle Egbert. “And 
now we’re making magic rings, 
staffs, gloves and lamps of our 



own. So long as it’s a long and 
complicated business to work 
enormous destruction, it may 
never happen. There’s always 
time for second thoughts. But 
make the destruction of a city, 
country, continent or world the 
work of an unpremeditated in- 
stant, and it can’t last much 
longer than — than little Meredith 
would.” 

I was a little angry with Un- 
cle Egbert. For Thea went silent 
and sad and thoughtful, most un- 
like Thea. He had managed to 
get an idea through her head, and 
I wished he hadn’t. 

TTE was right, that was the 
devil of it. Know how many 
alarms are given — fire bells rung, 
police and ambulances called, 
trains stopped — simply because 
someone has a fraction of a sec- 
ond of panic? 

A switch is a handy, innocuous 
thing when it merely controls an 
electric light. But suppose it con- 
trols life and death? Suppose any 
private, ordinary, aberrant, not- 
too-bright citizen can flip a 
switch that controls a hundred- 
thousand horse-power and a bil- 
lion volts? 

“Funny how one can never 
quite get used to the idea,” Un- 
cle Egbert said, “that one may 
never finish the breath one is just 
starting to take.” 

Again he reached his conclu- 



OPEN HOUSE 



95 



sion before anyone else, and 
again — though it took a year or 
two longer — intelligent, informed 
opinion caught up with him. 

We reached the sopo station at 
last, examined it and made two 
more like it. These were placed 
in the same orbit to triple the 
output. Already we found that 
what we had considered infinite 
power was very finite indeed, and 
wanted more. 

We made an underground city 
on the Moon. Finding that Mars 
was going to need oxygen replen- 
ishment, if we were ever going to 
be comfortable there, we set up 
an atmosphere plant. 

“Just like that,” Uncle Egbert 
murmured. “If a world hasn’t 
enough air, make it. Isn’t it sim- 
ple and obvious?” However, the 
atmosphere plant took a lot of 
power — the whole output of one 
of the sopo master plants. 

We went back and set up two 
more. 

The accident record didn’t bear 
thinking of, so we didn’t think 
of it. We split it up so that it 
didn’t show anywhere as a ma- 
tom total, so to speak. There were 
spaceship accidents, accidents on 
Mars, on the Moon, on Earth; 
there was sopo damage and loss 
of life; there were explosions, big 
and little, all over the place. 
There were murders, too, more 
spectacular now that it was so 
easy to destroy a few square 



miles of territory in making a 
good job of the victim. There 
were crimes made possible by the 
fact that with modified borers 
you could get into or out of any- 
thing, including bank vaults and 
prisons. 

As Uncle Egbert had said, 
“There’s no denying it — we’re 
children being given dangerous, 
destructive, disastrous toys.” 

Jacky and Meredith had a 
little sister to bully now, Doro- 
thea, but when the three of them 
were playing even Thea had the 
sense not to give them knives, 
pistols, rifles and red-hot pokers. 
That’s what the Visitors had 
done to us. And knowing what 
they obviously did about us, they 
must have drawn conclusions 
about what they were doing. 

TT1HEY miscalculated, however. 

They came back before we 
had destroyed ourselves, and 
after we had mastered the last 
secret of the matoms. 

Three of them dropped in on 
us, casually, without warning, 
just like the last time. It was 
Sunday, and our veranda was 
somewhat crowded, for we were 
all there . Uncle Egbert, Thea, 
Jacky, Meredith, Dorothea and I. 

“Hallo,” said Uncle Egbert 
pleasantly. He could be quite 
pleasant when he tried. “We’ve 
been expecting you. But not so 
soon.” 



96 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I had to hand it to him, he was 
cool. I’d often wondered if he’d 
be as bold as he made out when 
he was really tested. Well, he was. 

After all, these were the peo- 
ple who had left us the matoms. 

There was a period of confu- 
sion after Uncle Egbert spoke, 
because the Visitors still thought 
it was like the last time, and it 
wasn’t. Uncle Egbert and I both 
knew about the interference field 
now, and how to combat it. Thea 
didn’t, and Jacky and Meredith 
knew just enough to be thor- 
oughly puzzled and not have the 
faintest idea what was going on. 

The field has an effect not un- 
like hypnosis. It induces trance 
in which the victim is open to 
suggestion. He will believe that 
what has happened hasn’t, that 
what hasn’t happened has, and 
that what has happened has hap- 
pened differently. However, hyp- 
nosis afterward can’t recover the 
truth. Nor can the field, being es- 
sentially erasive, be used to re- 
cover it. 

Nevertheless, the interference 
field is effective only when it’s 
unexpected. Knowing about it, 
having some experience of it, we 
could resist the suggestion and 
see things as they were. Much as 
people can be immune to hyp- 
nosis, if they’re determined to re- 
sist and not co-operate. 

“We are just three ordinary- 
looking people,” said the first 



Visitor, and suddenly they were. 
His voice was flat and metallic. 
“With perfectly ordinary voices,” 
he added, and abruptly his voice 
was perfectly ordinary. 

But Uncle Egbert and I refus- 
ed to believe what we were told, 
and by a small mental effort saw 
the Visitors as they really were. 

The less said about that the 
better. 

“When we talk to you,” Visitor 
One went on, “you will reject or 
forget anything in the conversa- 
tion which seems odd or fright- 
ening or astonishing. You will not 
remember this, for example. You 
will . 

He went on to give instructions 
which accounted very thoroughly 
for what had happened the last 
time and what had been remem- 
bered of it . forgotten of it, 
rather. It was very interesting. 

A T the end Uncle Egbert said 
pleasantly, “I hope your . 
regulations are all against kill- 
ing? But I’m sure they are.” 
Movement among the Visitors 
seemed to indicate emotion. They 
were writhing, waving and undu- 
lating now, though they had been 
motionless before. 

“Killing?” said Two. “Killing 
you? Of course. It would be posi- 
tively revolting to — ” 

“Good,” sighed Uncle Egbert. 
“Now I feel a lot better.” 

I did, too. I had been thinking 



OPEN HOUSE 



97 



of sending the children inside, if 
the Visitors would let me, but 
had decided against it. While 
they were with us, I could see 
them and the Visitors. If they 
were out of my sight, I wouldn’t 
be able to stop worrying about 
what might be happening. 

“I also suppose,” Uncle Egbert 
went on, ‘‘your regulations would 
all be against instructing us in 
your technology, or leaving us in- 
struments and machines which 
we could dismantle?” 

“Indeed, yes . .” said Two, 
and simultaneously, “You will 
forget you asked that,” said One 
peremptorily. 

“Don’t let’s pretend any more,” 
said Uncle Egbert blandly. 

More writhing, waving and un- 
dulation. 

“Pretend?” asked Two, and the 
interference field became percep- 
tibly stronger. 

“That you have two arms and 
two legs, for example,” said Un- 
cle Egbert. 

“We are just three ordinary- 
looking people . .” Three began. 

It took them some time to be- 
lieve that the interference field 
was having absolutely no effect 
on Uncle Egbert. Then they be- 
lieved that it had failed with him 
and only him, and I had to dem- 
onstrate that it had failed with 
me, too. They didn’t go any fur- 
ther than that, fortunately. 

After that, all they wanted was 



to go away. We didn’t do any- 
thing to stop them. 

The next day the papers car- 
ried stories in startling contrast 
to the stories they had carried the 
first time the Visitors had been 
here. What had happened the 
first time — the complete success 
of their interference-field tactics; 
our preference for the compara- 
tively worthless things they had 
probably thrown in just as make- 
weights; the way we had allowed 
ourselves to be put exactly where 
they wanted us — must have been 
responsible for the enormous con- 
fidence which had led them 
straight to Earth without even 
making a cautious checkup from 
a distance. 

We had given them a shock, 
there was no doubt of that. 

npHIS time the papers carried 
long, detailed reports and even 
photographs. The Visitors didn’t 
look so bad in photographs. 

Our experience had been typi- 
cal. Nothing much had happened 
anywhere except that the Visi- 
tors rapidly decided they had the 
wrong number. 

“Notice that this time,” said 
Uncle Egbert, beaming over a 
newspaper and a soft-boiled egg 
at Thea and the children, “the 
Visitors didn’t leave matoms, 
they took them. We handed them 
out very much as they did last 
time.” 



98 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“And after they’ve examined 
them and worked out what to 
do,” I said uneasily, “they’ll be 
back.” 

Uncle Egbert just looked at 
me. And I saw for myself that 
they wouldn’t be back. Not the 
people (if you could call them 
that) who had been looking for 
an easy mark and had been sure 
they’d found it. The rapidity 
with which they got out, when 
they found the use we had made 
of the matoms, showed, when 
you thought of it, that they had 
given us up as being an easy 
thing. 

Like many a good bet, we had 
failed to pay off. 

Uncle Egbert and I read the 
papers and tried to answer the 
children’s eager questions. 

Presently Thea removed the 
children to get them off to school. 

When they were gone, I saw 
Uncle Egbert was frowning and 
felt a stab of apprehension. He 
had been right so far, sometimes 
years ahead of the newspapers, 
and however jubilant the news- 
papers might be, I’d rather he 
continued to beam than start to 
frown. 

“You don’t think they will 
come back, do you, Uncle Eg- 
bert?” I asked. 

He sniffed impatiently. “It 
wouldn’t matter in the least if 
they did,” he said. “ They took 
specimens this time — and I think 



it’s pretty clear that we’ve 
thought of a few things they 
haven’t. If we’re not on their 
technological level or above it, 
we soon will be.” 

“Then why look so glum?” 
“Why should I look happy? 
Because the Visitors have been 
here and gone? That changes 
nothing. We’ve nothing to fear 
from them.” 

“From them? Then from 
whom?” 

“The scheme’s as sound as it 
ever was,” said Uncle Egbert 
bluntly. “And it’ll work out ex- 
actly as they meant it to. They 
came a little early, that’s all.” 
Thea had been clearing away 
the dishes. She looked in inno- 
cent astonishment at him. 

“Oh, no, Uncle Egbert,” she 
said. “They came too late.” 

We both gaped at her. 

“It’s like the kids being let out 
of the house when the weather 
clears up. You know — keep them 
indoors and they fight and argue. 
Let them out and they get along 
fine. It’s the same with us. We 
have the planets instead of being 
cooped up on just one world.” 
Uncle Egbert hadn’t thought of 
that, I guess. But he was more 
amazed because she’d had an 
idea. That wouldn’t have hap- 
pened if the Visitors had not 
shown up. If she could, so could 
anybody. And would!

PYTHIAS 

By FREDERIK POHL 



Sure, Larry Connaught saved my 
life— but it was how he did it 
that forced me to murder himl 



I am sitting on the edge of 
what passes for a bed. It is 
made of loosely woven strips 
of steel, and there is no mattress, 
only an extra blanket of thin 
olive-drab. It isn’t comfortable; 
but of course they expect to make 
me still more uncomfortable. 

They expect to take me out of 
this precinct jail to the District 
prison and eventually to the 
death house. 

Sure there will be a trial first, 
but that is only a formality. Not 
only did they catch me with the 
smoking gun in my hand and 
Connaught bubbling to death 
through the hole in his throat, 



but I admitted it. 

I — knowing what I was doing, 
with, as they say, malice afore- 
thought — deliberately shot to 
death Laurence Connaught. 

They execute murderers. So 
they mean to execute me. 

Especially because Laurence 
Connaught had saved my life. 

Well, there are extenuating cir- 
cumstances. I do not think they 
would convince a jury. 

Connaught and I were close 
friends for years. We lost touch 
during the war. We met again 
in Washington, a few years after 
the war was over. We had, to 
some extent, grown apart; he had

become a man with a mission. He 
was working very hard on some- 
thing and he did not choose to 
discuss his work and there was 
nothing else in his life on which 
to form a basis for communica- 
tion. And — well, I had my own 
life, too. It wasn’t scientific re- 
search in my case — I flunked out 
of med school, while he went on. 
I’m not ashamed of it; it is noth- 
ing to be ashamed of. I simply 
was not able to cope with the 
messy business of carving corpses. 
I didn’t like it, I didn’t want to 
do it, and when I was forced to 
do it, I did it badly. So — I left. 

Thus I have no string of de- 
grees, but you don’t need them 
in order to be a Senate guard.

bly impressive career to you? 
Of course not; but I liked it. The 
Senators are relaxed and friendly 
when the guards are around, and 
you learn wonderful things about 
what goes on behind the scenes 
of government. And a Senate 
guard is in a position to do fav- 
ors — for newspapermen, who find 
a lead to a story useful; for gov- 
ernment officials, who sometimes 
base a whole campaign on one 
careless, repeated remark; and 
for just about anyone who would 
like to be in the visitors’ gallery 
during a hot debate. 

Larry Connaught, for instance. 
I ran into him on the street one 



day, and we chatted for a mom- 
ent, and he asked if it was possi- 
ble to get him in to see the 
upcoming foreign relations de- 
bate. It was; I called him the 
next day and told him I had 
arranged for a pass. And he was 
there, watching eagerly with his 
moist little eyes, when the Secre- 
tary got up to speak and there 
was that sudden unexpected yell, 
and the handful of Central 
American fanatics dragged out 
their weapons and began trying 
to change American policy with 
gunpowder. 

You remember the story, I 
suppose. There were only three 
of them, two with guns, one with 
a hand grenade. The pistol men 
managed to wound two Senators 
and a guard. I was right there, 
talking to Connaught. I spotted 
the little fellow with the hand 
grenade and tackled him. I 
knocked him down, but the gre- 
nade went flying, pin pulled, 
seconds ticking away. I lunged 
for it. Larry Connaught was 
ahead of me. 

The newspaper stories made 
heroes out of both of us. They 
said it was miraculous that 
Larry, who had fallen right on 
tbp of the grenade, had managed 
to get it away from himself and 
so placed that when it exploded 
no one was hurt. 

For it did go off — and the fly- 
ing steel touched nobody. The 



PY T H I A S 



101 



papers mentioned that Larry had 
been knocked unconscious by the 
blast. He was unconscious, all 
right. 

He didn’t come to for six 
hours and when he woke up, he 
spent the next whole day in a 
stupor. 

I called on him the next night. 
He was glad to see me. 

“That was a close one, Dick,” 
he said. “Take me back to 
Tarawa.” 

I said, “I guess you saved my 
life, Larry.” 

“Nonsense, Dick! I just 
jumped. Lucky, that’s all.” 

“The papers said you were 
terrific. They said you moved so 
fast, nobody could see exactly 
what happened.” 

He made a deprecating ges- 
ture, but his wet little eyes were 
wary. “Nobody was really watch- 
ing, I suppose.” 

“I was watching,” I told him 
flatly. 

He looked at me silently for a 
moment. 

“I was between you and the 
grenade,” I said. “You didn’t go 
past me, over me, or through me. 
But you were on top of the 
grenade.” 

He started to shake his head. 

I said, “Also, Larry, you fell 
on the grenade. It exploded 
underneath you. I know, because 
I was almost on top of you, and 
it blew you clear off the floor of 



the gallery. Did you have a 
bulletproof vest on?” 

TTE cleared his throat. “Well, 
as a matter of — ” 

“Cut it out, Larry! What’s the 
answer?” 

He took off his glasses and 
rubbed his watery eyes. He 
grumbled, “Don’t you read the 
papers? It went off a yard away.” 

“Larry,” I said gently, “I was 
there.” 

He slumped back in his chair, 
staring at me. Larry Connaught 
was a small man, but he never 
looked smaller than he did in that 
big chair, looking at me as 
though I were Mr. Nemesis him- 
self. 

Then he laughed. He surprised 
me; he sounded almost happy. 
He said, “Well, hell, Dick— I had 
to tell somebody about it sooner 
or later. Why not you?” 

I can’t tell you all of what he 
said. I’ll tell most of it — but not 
the part that matters. 

I’ll never tell that part to any- 
body. 

Larry said, “I should have 
known you’d remember.” He 
smiled at me ruefully, affection- 
ately. “Those bull sessions- in the 
cafeterias, eh? Talking all night 
about everything. But you re- 
membered.” 

“You claimed that the human 
mind possessed powers of psy- 
chokinesis,” I said. “You argued 



102 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



that just by the mind, without 
moving a finger or using a ma- 
chine, a man could move his 
body anywhere, instantly. You 
said that nothing was impossible 
to the mind.” 

I felt like an absolute fool 
saying those things; they were 
ridiculous notions. Imagine a 
man thinking himself from one 
place to another! But — I had been 
on that gallery. 

I licked my lips and looked to 
Larry Connaught for confirma- 
tion. 

“I was all wet,” Larry laughed. 
“Imagine!” 

I suppose I showed surprise, 
because he patted my shoulder. 

He said, becoming sober, 
“Sure, Dick, you’re wrong, but 
you’re right all the same. The 
mind alone can’t do anything of 
the sort — that was just a silly 
kid notion. But,” he went on, 
“but there are — well, techniques 
— linking the mind to physical 
forces — simple physical forces 
that we all use every day — that 
can do it all. Everything! Every- 
thing I ever thought of and 
things I haven’t found out yet. 

“Fly across the ocean? In a 
second, Dick! Wall off an ex- 
ploding bomb? Easily! You saw 
me do it. Oh, it’s work. It takes 
energy — you can’t escape natural 
law. That was what knocked me 
out for a whole day. But that was 
a hard one; it’s a lot easier, for 



instance, to make a bullet miss its 
target. It’s even easier to lift 
the cartridge out of the chamber 
and put it in my pocket, so that 
the bullet can’t even be fired. 
Want the Crown Jewels of Eng- 
land? I could get them, Dick!” 
I asked, “Can you see the fu- 
ture?” 

He frowned. “That’s silly. This 
isn’t supersti — ” 

“How about reading minds?” 

L ARRY’S expression cleared. 

“Oh, you’re remembering 
some of the things I said years 
ago. No, I can’t do that either, 
Dick. Maybe, some day, if I keep 
working at this thing — Well, I 
can’t right now. There are things 
I can do, though, that are just 
as good.” 

“Show me something you can 
do,” I asked. 

He smiled. Larry was enjoying 
himself; I didn’t begrudge it to 
him. He had hugged this to him- 
self for years, from the day he 
found his first clue, through the 
decade of proving and experi- 
menting, almost always being 
wrong, but always getting closer. 
. He needed to talk about it. 
I think he was really glad that, 
at last, someone had found him 
out. 

He said, “Show you some- 
thing? Why, let’s see, Dick.” He 
looked around the room, then 
winked. “See that window?” 



py T H I A S 



103 



I looked. It opened with a 
slither of wood and a rumble of 
sashweights. It closed again. 

“The radio,” said Larry. There 
was a click and his little set 
turned itself on. “Watch it.” 

It disappeared and reappeared. 

“It was on top of Mount Ever- 
est,” Larry said, panting a little. 

The plug on the radio’s elec- 
tric cord picked itself up and 
stretched toward the baseboard 
socket, then dropped to the floor 
again. 

“No,” said Larry, and his voice 
was trembling, “I’ll show you a 
hard one. Watch the radio, Dick. 
I’ll run it without plugging it in! 
The electrons themselves — ” 

He was staring intently at the 
little set. I saw the dial light go 
on, flicker, and hold steady; the 
speaker began to make scratch- 
ing noises. I stood up, right be- 
hind Larry, right over him. 

I used the telephone on the 
table beside him. I caught him 
right beside the ear and he fold- 
ed over without a murmur. 
Methodically, I hit him twice 
more, and then I was sure he 
wouldn’t wake up for at least an 
hour. I rolled him over and put 
the telephone back in its cradle. 

I ransacked his apartment. I 
found it in his desk : All his notes. 
All the information. The secret of 
how to do the things he could do. 

I picked up the telephone and 
called the Washington police. 



When I heard the siren outside, I 
took out my service revolver and 
shot him in the throat. He was 
dead before they came in. 

F OR, you see, I knew Laurence 
Connaught. We were friends. 
I would have trusted him with 
my life. But this was more than 
just a life. 

Twenty-three words told how 
to do the things that Laurence 
Connaught did. Anyone who 
could read could do them. Crim- 
inals, traitors, lunatics — the 
formula would work for anyone. 

Laurence Connaught was an 
honest man and an idealist, I 
think. But what would happen to 
any man when he became God? 
Suppose you were told twenty- 
three words that would let you 
reach into any bank vault, peer 
inside any closed room, walk 
through any wall? Suppose pis- 
tols could not kill you? 

They say power corrupts; and 
absolute power corrupts abso- 
lutely. And there can be no more 
absolute power than the twenty- 
three words that can free a man 
of any jail or give him anything 
he wants. Larry was my friend. 
But I killed him in cold blood, 
knowing what I did, because he 
could not be trusted with the 
secret that could make him king 
of the world. 

But I can.

S PECIAL Note: The July 1954 
issue of a minor journal called 
International Record of Medicine 
and General Practice Clinics ran 
a piece by one Robert Plank, 
Ll.D., M.S.W. — a ‘social worker, 
for God’s sake — on “The Repro- 
duction of Psychosis in Science 
Fiction.” I finished reading it 
with a feeling that the author 
thought most science fiction writ- 
ers (and, by implication, readers, 
too) were bugs. “Schizomorph” 
is what he calls the stories, thus 
accusing the writers of having 
schizoid personalities, “especially 
of the paranoid type.” 

Well, now that science fiction 



has received a diagnostic acco- 
lade, I thought it might be of 
interest to Galaxy readers to 
learn what it is their favorite 
writers seem to be suffering from 
in the way of barminess. I’ve just 
come across a publication that 
really gives the lowdown in terms 
of definitions and descriptions of 
mental conditions. It is called 
Diagnostic and Statistical Man- 
ual, Mental Disorders, and it is 
published by the American Psy- 
chiatric Association, 1785 Mas- 
sachusetts Ave., N.W., Washing- 
ton 6, D. C., at $1.50 per copy, 
available only by mail from 
them. 



106 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



It contains, in pages 12 through 
43, the best definitions of the in- 
numerable mental disablements 
men are heir to that I have ever 
seen. 

From every point of view, 
the book is a gold mine: a won- 
derfully informative guide for us 
s-f readers and a rich source for 
story plots, character develop- 
ment, etc., for the writing frater- 
nity. 

Mention Galaxy when order- 
ing your copy, too, so we can see 
what sort of response we get to 
a review this far off the usual 
track. 

ASSIGNMENT IN TOMOR- 
ROW, edited by Frederik Pohl. 
Hanover House, $2.95 

S IXTEEN short stories and 
novelets, only four of which I 
_ didn’t like too well, make the 
quality of Fred Pohl’s third an- 
thology from the s-f magazines 
rate way up at the top. 

Seven of the best items are 
from Galaxy, the rest from the 
Competition. Only del Rey’s 
“Helen O’Loy” and Editor 
Gold’s superb “A Matter of 
Form” have previously been an- 
thologized; the rest are new to 
book form. 

Among the best new ones are 
Sturgeon’s multi-level fable of 
mob rule called “Mr. Costello, 
Hero,” and Kurt Vonnegut’s 



“The Big Trip Up Yonder,” both 
from Galaxy, and Bester’s 
“5,271,009,” from Fantasy & Sci- 
ence Fiction, which bears a fasci- 
nating resemblance to Sturgeon’s 
“To Here and the Easel,” re- 
viewed last month. 

Other first-rate tales are by 
Kornbluth, Williamson, Wilson, 
Phillips, Bradbury, Brown and 
Schmitz. 

V-2 by Walter Dornberger. 
Viking Press, $5.00 

T HIS is probably the most 
thrilling and impressive book 
on “space travel” yet published, 
and certainly one of the most 
distressing. On the one hand, it 
is just about the only book on 
the prototype deep space rocket 
that has ever been written en- 
tirely in the past tense. There’s 
very little extrapolation here, you 
may be sure. 

General Dornberger, who was 
head of the Peenemunde rocket 
station, tells the actual history of 
the development of the grand- 
father of tomorrow’s Moon rock- 
et, the V-2 that bombed England. 
And it is a fantastically vivid, 
unforgettably real story. 

On the other hand, it presents 
a moral problem that is both fas- 
cinating and repulsive. 

Dornberger, more than any 
other man, was responsible for 
the development of the V-2 as a 



★ ★ ★ ★ ★ SHELF 



107 



weapon designed strictly for ci- 
vilian destruction. Plans for it 
and actual work had begun long 
before the panzer divisions 
marched through Poland in 1939, 
opening World War II. 

The general attempts to clear 
his conscience by saying that in 
the back of everyone’s mind was 
the V-2’s value as a “prelimi- 
nary” spaceship. The attempt 
does not ring true. V-2 was a 
mass-murder weapon from the 
start and the only reason it did 
not win the war was the stupid 
shortsightedness of Hitler et al 
in refusing all-out support for the 
Peenemunde establishment. 

Willy Ley’s introduction is 
richly informative — in some 
ways, the most pertinent part of 
the book, because of its strictly 
impartial approach. 

SHADOWS IN THE SUN by 
Chad Oliver. Ballantine Books, 
Inc., $2.00 and 35c 

T HE theme of alien invasions 
of our planet is a perennially 
interesting one, whether it con- 
cerns such “nonfiction” as the 
Flying Saucer cults or such vivid 
fictions as H. G. Wells’ War of 
the Worlds or the tale here under 
review. 

These two novels are at op- 
posite ends of the spectrum on 
this theme: Wells with his aliens 
brutally trying to conquer Earth ; 



Oliver with his completely hu- 
man invaders trying to keep their 
presence a deep secret from 
Earthbound humanity, to live 
side by side with us without our 
knowing it. 

The Earth hero of the story is 
a cultural anthropologist named 
Paul Ellery, who is studying Jef- 
ferson Springs, Texas, for a book 
on the patterns of life in a typical 
American small town. His suspi- 
cions are aroused when he finds 
out that no resident of the town 
has lived in it for more than 15 
years — although the village itself 
is many decades old. What he 
finds is the cause of this odd phe- 
nomenon, and how he attempts 
to cope with his amazing discov- 
ery makes a solid, moving and 
intelligently imaginative tale. 

The ending, however, is so in- 
conclusive that one wonders 
whether the author is not plan- 
ing a sequel. It demands one, for 
the present book leaves the situ- 
ation almost as the hero found 
it, with the world still sitting on 
a “bomb” that is much more 
devastating potentially than a 
hydrogen bomb ever could be. 

It just can’t be left like that, 
Mr. Oliver!

and ADVENTURES IN THE 
FAR FUTURE, edited by Don- 
ald A. Wolheim. Ace Books, 
Inc., 35c 



108 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



THHE new Ace “Double” is an 
odd one — an anthology of 10 
stories with five under one of the 
above titles and five under the 
other. 

All are new to book publi- 
cation and, I am afraid, at least 
half don’t deserve it. 

Five do, though: Ralph Wil- 
liams’ tale originally called 
“Bertha;” Cliff Simak’s, first 
published as “Masquerade;” 
Chad Oliver’s excellent “Star- 
dust;” del Rey’s “The Wind Be- 
tween the Worlds” (from this 
magazine); and Poul Anderson’s 
“Lord of a Thousand Suns,” one 
of two in the collection by this 
author. 

The other five stories range 
from passably entertaining to not 
entertaining at all. Nevertheless, 
for the price, the little book is a 
good buy. 

LUCKY STARR AND THE 
OCEANS OF VENUS by Paul 
French. Doubleday 85 Co., Inc., 
$2.50 

HHHE third in the “Paul French” 
(Isaac Asimov) series of 
space adventures is the best yet 
— a colorful and exciting tale of 
weird beings and doings on a 
Venus conceived by the author 
to be entirely covered with deep 
oceans under its thus-far-impen- 
etrable cloud canopy. 

The notion of a “wet” Venus is 



an old one, and though most 
modern astronomers seem to be- 
lieve that the planet actually is 
all desert, their point has not 
been proven and probably won’t 
be until we actually visit our 
neighbor world. 

In any event, the author’s con- 
cept of human colonies on the 
bottom of the Venusian sea is a 
rich one and his development of 
the melodramatic plot is swift 
and sure. It’s a real thriller for 
fans of all ages. 

THE SCIENCE FICTION 
SUBTREASURY by Wilson 
Tucker. Rinehart 8s Co., $2.75 

T DON’T know what’s wrong 
with me. Old age? Contrari- 
ness? Anyhow, I have to confess 
that I just can’t make contact 
with most of these ten Tucker 
tales. It can’t be Tucker’s fault, 
so it must be mine. Or is it? 

I found all but two or three of 
the stories almost empty and 
some of them rather weak paral- 
lels of stories by other writers. 

I did enjoy “Able to Zebra,” 
“Exit” and “The Job Is Ended” 
(even though its conclusion is 
confusing and unsatisfactory). 
But the rest, I regret to say, left 
me quite cold.

★ ★★★★SHELF

TT is beyond my comprehension 
why this 1938 serial should 
now be awkwardly updated on 
the “scientific” side and put on 
the market at this particular 
time, for it is anti-science sci- 
ence fiction of the most appalling 
sort. 

Ruthless free-enterpriser Si- 
mon Drega is the hero; brilliant 
but vain and sociologically in- 
fantile Simon Gamble is the sci- 
entist-villain. Gamble puts the 
whole world into suspended ani- 
mation for 3,000 years (he wasn’t 
even a good scientist; he’d meant 
the period to be only 75 years!) 
and when the people come to, 
the physical plant of civilization 
has naturally rotted almost en- 
tirely away. All but a handful 
of people are killed as they try to 
get out from under the wreckage. 

Gamble tries to build a “pure- 
science” society on the ruins — 
and fails, of course. Drega builds 
a “survival-of-the-fittest” society 
by the use of “rough shod” (blurb 
adjective) methods like those of 
a particularly nasty construction 
boss — and succeeds, natchmente. 

This is a book from the Pale- 
olithic Period of modern s-f. It 
never should have been exhumed. 

B RIEF Note s. If you missed 
the hardbound editions of 
Arthur C. Clarke’s Against the 



Fall of Night or his excellent 
nonfiction The Exploration of 
Space, you can now get them in 
paperback editions — the first a 
Permabook Star at 25c and the 
second a Pocket Book Cardinal 
at 35c. Wonderful buys, both of 
them . For owners of Don 
Day’s invaluable Index to the 
Science Fiction Magazines, 1926- 
1950, the compiler has turned out 
an errata sheet which they can 
have on request from The Perri 
Press, Box 5007, Portland 13, 
Ore. A useful addition to the 
book it is, too. And if you don’t 
have the Index (and you should) 
it still is available from the same 
source at $5.00 a copy . For 
devotees of Lord Dunsany’s later 
work in the “Jorkens” series. The 
Devin-Adair Company has pub- 
lished a surprising treat, a selec- 
tion of 16 of the best items from 
his early volumes of poetic fairy 
tales and supernatural stories, 
mostly written before 1920. It’s 
too bad, though, that the book 
does not contain any of the ex- 
quisite drawings by S. H. Sime 
which appeared in the original 
volumes. Those in the new book, 
by Robert Barrell, are consider- 
ably inferior. The book is called 
The Sword of Welleran and it 
costs $3.00. 

Don’t miss it!

SPOT 

By BASCOM JONES, JR. 



Every one supported the Martian 

program— until it struck home! 



J OHNNY STARK, director 
of the department of Inter- 
planetary Relations for 
Mars’ Settlement One, reread the 
final paragraph of the note which 
he had found on his desk, upon 
returning from lunch earlier in 
the day. 

His eye flicked rapidly over the 
the moistly smeared Martian 
scrawl, ignoring the bitterness 
directed at him in the first para- 
graphs. He was vaguely troubled 
by the last sentences. But he 
hadn’t been able to pin the feel- 
ing down. 



.... Our civilization predates 
that of Earth’s by millions of 
years. We are an advanced, peace- 
ful race. Yet, since Earth’s first 
rocket landed here thirteen years 
ago, we have been looked upon as 
freaks and contemptuously called 
‘ bug- men’ behind our backs! This 
is our planet. We gave of our far- 
advanced knowledge and science 
freely, so that Earth would be a 
better place. We asked nothing 
in return, but we were rewarded 
by having forced upon us foreign 
ideas of government, religion, 
and behavior. Our protests have

been silenced by an armed-police 
and punitive system we’ve never 
before needed. Someday you will 
awaken to this injustice. On that 
day in your life, you have my 
sympathy and pity! 

Stark knew that the Settle- 
ment’s Investigations Lab could 
readily determine the identity of 
the Martian who had written the 
note. But he hesitated to send it 
over. Under the New System, 
such troublemakers were ban- 
ished to the slave-labor details 
of the precious-earth mines to 
the North. 

Crumpling the note in sudden 
decision, Stark dropped it into 
the office incendiary tube. The 
morning visi-report had shown 
that there were more than 17,000 
workers at the mines. Only five 
had been Earthlings. Let the 
armed - police system find the 
Martian through their own chan- 
nels. It wasn’t his job. 

A GLANCE at the solar clock 
on the far wall reminded him 
there was still time for one more 
interview before the last bell, so 
he impatiently signaled his sec- 
retary to send in the waiting 
couple. 

Ordinarily, he liked his work 
and time meant little to him. He 
had jumped from interpreter to 
director in the ten years since 
the department had been created. 



But this day was different. 

Stark was to announce his en- 
gagement at the Chiefs monthly 
dinner party that evening and 
time had seemed to drag since 
his lunch with Carol. 

When the door opened, he rose 
and nodded to the plump, frec- 
kled-faced girl who entered. The 
girl topped five feet by one or 
two inches, but she was no taller 
than the Martian man who fol- 
lowed her at the prescribed four 
feet. 

After the girl had seated her- 
self, Stark and the Martian sat 
down. Stark opened the folder, 
which his secretary had placed on 
his desk earlier. 

“Your names are Ruth and 
Ralph Gilraut? And you want 
permission to move into Housing 
Perimeter D?” It was merely a 
formality, since the information 
was in the folder. 

When the girl nodded, Stark 
placed a small check mark in the 
space beside her name. Then he 
turned to the Martian. 

The large, single red eye set 
deep in the Martian’s smooth, 
green forehead above the two 
brown ones .blinked twice before 
he answered. 

He spoke deliberately. “As is 
required of all Martians under 
the New System, I have taken 
the name of one of the early 
Earthlings to write and pro- 
nounce.” The large red eye blink-

ed again. “My wife would like to 
move into Housing Perimeter D. 
By regulation, I respect her 
wish.” 

Stark placed a check mark by 
the Martian’s name. He wiped 
the smudge of ink off his hand 
and said, “You both know, of 
course, that Perimeter D is re- 
served for couples who have in- 
termarried and are about to have 
offspring?” 

The girl and the Martian nod- 
ded, and the girl passed Stark a 
medical report. Stark looked over 
the report and then made a no- 
tation on a small pink slip. 

He said, “This permit certifies 
that you are eligible to move 
from Perimeter E to Housing Pe- 
rimeter D. It also certifies that 
your husband has no record as a 
troublemaker.” Stark looked at 
the girl. “You understand that 
you may visit your friends in Pe- 
rimeter E, but, by law, they will 
not be allowed to enter Perime- 
ter D to visit you. And, of course, 
the new law clearly states that 
neither of you may visit Earth- 
lings in Housing Perimeter A, 
B or C.” 

The girl looked down at her 
hands. Her voice was almost in- 
audible. “My husband and I are 
familiar with the advantages and 
disadvantages listed under the 
section pertaining to intermar- 
riage in the new law, Mr. Stark. 
Thank you.” 



S TARK rose as they left. For 
a brief moment, he thought 
he had detected a sense of rebel- 
lion in their attitude. But that 
was not possible. 

The new law provided equality 
for all. And his department had 
been created to iron out relations 
between the two races — excepting 
complaints originated by trouble- 
makers for the purpose of weak- 
ening the New System. In such 
cases, Investigations had stepped 
in and the Martian or Earthling 
troublemaker had been sent to 
the rare-earths mines. 

The reddish light filtering in 
through the quartz and lead wall 
of his office showed that it was 
almost time for the last bell. 

On the street below, shoppers 
were streaming out of the stores 
on their way to the various hous- 
ing perimeters. 

Earthlings were climbing into 
their speedy little jet cars for the 
short trip to the recently mod- 
ernized inner perimeters. Marti- 
ans were waiting for the slower 
auto buses. The traffic problem 
had been solved, under the New 
System, by restricting the use 
of the Martian-built jet cars to 
persons living in the inner perim- 
eters. 

As Stark watched, a black jet 
car impatiently hurtled out of 
the line of traffic, bowled through 
a crowd pf Martians waiting for 
an auto bus, and skidded to a 



114 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



stop at the curb in front of the 
building. 

A tall girl got out. The red 
evening glow reflecting from her 
golden hair, made her breathing 
globe almost amber. Male Mar- 
tians and Earthlings alike turned 
to stare in appreciation as she 
pushed her way through the 
crowd to the building’s compress- 
or lock. Carol was that kind of 
girl. 

A LMOST at the exact moment 
that Carol opened the door 
into Stark’s office, the yellow visi- 
screen of the vocal box upon 
Stark’s desk flashed on brilliantly 
and the Chief’s booming voice 
filled the office. The light from the 
screen picked up the highlights 
on the furniture and gave a sal- 
low, greenish cast to Stark’s fea- 
tures. Carol stepped back into 
the doorway to stay out of range 
of the two-way unit. 

“Stark!” The automatic tuner 
on the box corrected to bring the 
Chief’s image in wire-sharp focus. 
“Yes, sir?” 

“About the dinner tonight. Just 
checking to make sure you’re 
planning to be there. We want a 
full turnout. An inspection team 
has come up from Earth and we 
have two visiting dignitaries from 
Venus.” 

Stark nodded and waited for 
the Chief to say something else, 
but the visi-screen blanked out. 



Carol said, “That was Dad, 
wasn’t it?” 

Stark felt very depressed sud- 
denly. “Haven’t you told him 
yet?” 

“No. He’s been tied up with 
those inspectors all afternoon. 
And you know how Dad is, 
Johnny. There’s a right and a 
wrong time to tell him things. 
Right now, he’s only interested 
in hearing about Earth.” 

“But we’re supposed to an- 
nounce our engagement tonight 
at the dinner.” He shook his head. 
“We can’t go on forever with just 
a few stolen moments here and 
there, eating an occasional lunch 
or third meal together in little 
out-of-the-way places.” 

Carol laughed, the youthful 
swell of her breasts against the 
soft, spun-glass material of her 
blouse. “Don’t worry so, Johnny! 
I’m a big girl now. This is my 
eighteenth birthday. Dad’s bark 
is much worse than his bite. I’ll 
tell him about us on the way 
home.” 

She moved closer to him, until 
he could feel the warmth of her 
body. He could see the warm, 
damp indentation where her 
breathing globe had rested 
against her shoulders and chest. 

She asked teasingly, “What did 
you get me for my birthday, 
Johnny? Something real nice?” 

“What did you want?” Johnny 
asked her gently. 



BUND SPOT 



115 



A ND suddenly she wasn’t teas- 
■‘®- ing any more. She put her 
arms around him. “Dad and my 
brother would say I’m crazy. But 
all I want, Johnny, is you. Just 
you! You know that.” 

Stark had picked out her birth- 
day present, but he wanted it to 
be a surprise for that night. He 
said, “I already saw one of your 
presents. A black jet car!” 

“How did you know that?” 

“I saw you drive up in it a 
few minutes ago.” 

Carol giggled. “Dad gave it to 
me. Did you see me plow through 
that crowd waiting for the auto 
bus?” 

“Did your brother send you 
anything?” 

She nodded. “Three new outfits 
from Earth. They were on the 
same liner that brought the in- 
spection team to the Settlement 
this morning. Oh, yes, and the 
captain of the liner brought me 
this.” 

She showed him the tiny pin 
she wore attached to her collar. 
The pin itself was a carefully 
wrought but cruel caricature of 
an awkward buglike creature. A 
small ruby set in the center of its 
face served as its eye. 

Stark frowned. “Carol, you 
shouldn’t be wearing that.” He 
reached up and unpinned it. 
“That’s the sort of thing our de- 
partment is fighting.” 

“But the captain said it was 



the latest rage back on Earth. 
They’re even making toys like it. 
I’m sure they’re not designed to 
... to poke fun at anyone.” 
Stark started to say something, 
but the last bell interrupted him. 
He said, “If you’re going to take 
your father home and tell him 
about us before the dinner, you’d 
better hurry. I’ll come early.” 
Carol kissed him and said 
good-by. She left the pin on 
Stark’s desk and was smiling at 
him as she closed the door. 

A FTER waiting until the first 
rush of workers had gone and 
the building was quiet, Stark 
caught the elevator down. The 
overhead lights in the compressor 
lock were reflected in the twin 
rows of breathing globes. The 
green -tinted ones had to be used 
by Martians in the building, and 
the clear ones were used by 
Earthmen when they were out- 
side in the Martian atmosphere. 

Stark stopped in at a little open 
shop down one of the many side 
streets. The sign said “Closed,” 
but he rang the bell until a little, 
dried-up Martian appeared. 

The storekeeper handed him a 
small box. Stark opened it to ex- 
amine the ring — Carol’s birthday 
present. The single, large dia- 
mond set in the thin precious- 
metal band dated back to an 
all-but-forgotten custom prac- 
ticed on Earth. Stark thought the 



116 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



engagement ring would please 
Carol, though. 

Standing in the compressor 
lock at the Chief’s home later, 
Stark rubbed the diamond against 
the sleeve of his tunic. He fum- 
bled with his breathing globe and 
then pushed the button that ac- 
tivated the door. The tele-guard 
beyond the opening door scanned 
him rapidly. As he stepped for- 
ward, a red light above the tele- 
guard flashed on and the door 
began to close again. 

Stark threw all his strength 
against the door and squeezed 
through into the house. 

Throughout the house, Stark 
could hear the alarm bell. A taped 
voice, activated by the tele-guard, 
said, “Do not enter! Do not en- 
ter!” 

He found Carol and the Chief 
in the library alone. Nearly pur- 
ple with rage, the Chief drew him- 
self up to his full six feet. 

The Chief bellowed, “Stark! 
Are you crazy?” 

The growing feeling of sick- 
ness spread through Stark. 

“Who do you think you are?” 
the Chief yelled. “Get back to 
your office and consider yourself 
under arrest as a troublemaker. 
Give you people an inch and you 
try to walk away with everything. 
Why, I wouldn’t let you touch 
my daughter if you were the last 
living being in the Universe!” 

Carol didn’t look up. She stood 



through it all, silently, without 
moving. Stark knew now where 
his blind spot had been. He turn- 
ed and left them. 

T>ACK at his office, he waited 
-Ufor the police. Stark stared 
down at his reflection in the pol- 
ished top of the desk. A yellow, 
moist film of sweat covered his 
face. The red eye set in his fore- 
head blinked. But the pain visi- 
ble just behind the surface of that 
eye was not over Carol or him- 
self. 

The pain was for what he was 
seeing for the first time . now.

C URTIS Delman was the 
last to leave the space 
liner. It was only when 
the Captain entered that he 
ceased dictating and put down 
the microphone. Then, with the 
clumsy deliberation of the aged, 
he pressed home the lid of the 



recorder and turned the key in 
the lock. There was almost a mile 
of fine wire in that box — a mile 
of detailed instruction, compiled 
over the past four days. For a 
centenarian, his energy was pro- 
digious. 

The Captain stood respectfully 




RICH LIVING 



119 



by the door, waiting to be no- 
ticed. Delman beckoned him into 
the suite. 

Hat in hand, the Captain 
walked over to the desk. “I 
thought you’d like to know, sir, 
the rest of the passengers have 
disembarked.” He spoke with 
deference. 

“Good,” said Delman. “I shan’t 
delay you more than a few min- 
utes longer.” 

“Oh, no delay, I assure you, 
sir,” the Captain replied hastily. 
“Only too happy to be of service. 
The crew asked me to thank you 
on their behalf, sir, for your great 
generosity. It was more than — er 
— generous.” Words seemed to 
fail him. 

“Not at all, Captain,” Delman 
said. “You’ve all done your best 
to make the crossing as comfort- 
able as possible and I’m very 
grateful to you. Perhaps you’d 
do one more thing for me on your 
return — deliver this to my repre- 
sentative in London.” He pointed 
to the recording machine. 

“Certainly, sir.” 

“Then that takes care of every- 
thing.” The great lawyer rose 
creakily to his feet. Though bent 
with age, he was still an impres- 
sive figure, tall and powerfully 
built, his white hair spilling out 
over the massive forehead. “I sup- 
pose the press is here?” 

“I’m afraid so, sir.” 

“Well, one can’t dodge them 



on Jupiter. There’s no room to 
move as it is.” 

^F'HE Captain laughed sympa- 
thetically. No one knew better 
than himself the limitations of 
the planet. He’d lived here as a 
child, grown up under that plas- 
tic bubble which Man had built 
to preserve an atmosphere — two 
thousand acres of habitable land 
in a wilderness of millions of 
square miles. It was enough to 
break the heart of any boy. 

Delman stooped to pick up his 
two heavy canes. The Captain 
leaped forward and handed them 
to him. Then lawyer and skipper 
left the suite and moved slowly 
toward the gangway. As they 
reached the steps, the Captain 
broke the silence. 

“It’s been a privilege to have 
you on board, sir, and perhaps 
we may hope to take you home 
again on your return from Re- 
juvenal.” 

Curtis Delman smiled. “Well, 
Captain, it’s foolhardy for me to 
plan nearly two years ahead, but 
I hope so, too.” 

They shook hands. 

With a steward supporting him 
on either side, the ancient lawyer 
climbed carefully down the steps. 

A spacelines official had 
thoughtfully provided a chair. 
He sat down. The usual array of 
microphones and tele-cameras 



120 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



was grouped around him. Some- 
one appealed for silence. In the 
hush that followed, only his own 
persuasive voice was heard. 

“I have no prepared state- 
ment,” he said, “but I assume 
you gentlemen wish to ask me 
some questions. In that event, I’d 
just like to stress that I’m not as 
young as I used to be — or per- 
haps I should say, as I hope to 
be — and I’d be obliged if you kept 
them short and to the point.” 

There were about thirty re- 
porters present and among them 
he recognized several faces that 
he had seen before. A few would 
belong to the local network, but 
most of them were probably at- 
tached to one of the Universal 
syndicates. It was a red-headed 
youngster who got in the first 
question; the others were quick 
to follow. 

“Is it true, sir, that this will 
be your fourth visit to Rejuve- 
nal?” 

“Yes, perfectly true.” 

“Has anyone else been there 
four times?” 

“No. To the best of my knowl- 
edge, I’m the first person to at- 
tempt it. Several others have 
been at least twice.” 

“Because no one else could af- 
ford it?” 

“I didn’t say that. Most peo- 
ple tire of life. I don’t.” 

Years of experience had ac- 



customed the lawyer to these in- 
terviews. The purring cameras 
failed to distract him. In fact, he 
almost relished the buzz of com- 
petent confusion around him. 
“How long does the trip take?” 
“Two hundred and fifty days 
out, the same back, and ninety 
days on the planet.” 

“Don’t you find that a tedious 
journey?” 

“Long, yes. Tedious, no. Don’t 
forget, one has expectations. Be- 
sides, the early trips from Earth 
to Jupiter took twice as long.” 
“Now they take four days.” 
“No doubt, but that doesn’t 
alter the argument.” 

“Mr. Delman, what is the 
speed of change?” 

“You mean the rate at which 
the burden of years drops from 
one’s shoulders?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Almost exactly one year for 
every twenty-four hours spent on 
the planet.” 

“So that, in ninety days, you’re 
ninety years younger?” 
“Correct.” 

“How old are you now, sir?” 

D ELMAN scratched his head 
reflectively. The reporters 
laughed. 

“That’s a difficult question. So 
far as natural decay is concerned, 
I think I’m a hundred and fif- 
teen. Of course, my actual life- 



RICH LIVING 



121 



span has been nearer three 
hundred and eighty-seven; but 
please don’t credit me with being 
a Methuselah. I’ve a long way to 
go yet.” 

“Is it a fact that the round trip 
costs five million dollars?” 

“I’m afraid I can’t answer 
that. It’s a condition of the con- 
tract that passengers refrain from 
disclosing the price of their tick- 
ets.” 

“It is expensive, though?” 

“Oh, naturally. But remember, 
the overhead is heavy. Three re- 
fueling bases on the minor plan- 
ets, Borenius, Ziar and Algon, 
require constant maintenance, 
apart from the initial cost of 
runways. Then only five — er — 
patients can be housed on Reju- 
venal at any given time. And one 
also has to consider the constant 
change of staff. You’d scarcely 
expect it to be cheap.” 

There was a sudden pause in 
the questioning. The lawyer took 
the opportunity to rise up out of 
his chair. This provoked an im- 
mediate response; all spoke at 
once in deafening unison. Del- 
man held up his hand for silence, 
then turned and addressed the 
red-headed reporter on his left. 

“Young man, since you were 
the first to begin this examina- 
tion, I’ll give you two questions 
with which to wind up for your 
side. Only two, mind.” 

The reporter thought for a mo- 



ment. “Who are your fellow pas- 
sengers?” he asked. 

“I don’t know. I thought you 
might be able to tell me that. 
And the second question?” 

“Well, sir, I suppose I ought to 
ask whether you have any special 
message for the Universe.” 
Curtis Delman chuckled. 
“No,” he said, “nothing of im- 
portance. Just that I’d be glad if 
the law remained substantially 
unaltered during my absence. It’s 
hard enough to keep abreast as 
things are. Now if you’ll excuse 
me, gentlemen — ” 

The tele-cameras swiveled as, 
cane in each hand, he hobbled 
toward the Terminal Building. 
Security officers cleared a path 
for him. A group of onlookers 
began to applaud. It was a re- 
ception more in keeping with a 
politician than a lawyer, but 
Curtis Delman held a unique 
position. 

He had been the acknowledged 
leader of his profession for over 
three hundred years — a record no 
politician could ever hope to 
equal. 

rpHE Vice President of Reju- 
venal Enterprises, Inc., had 
been speaking for the best part 
of half an hour. He was a dapper 
little man whose white tunic was 
fringed with green and purple. 
He had a slight Venusian accent, 
very bookish, very precise and 



122 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



very irritating. All five passen- 
gers sat in his office and waited 
with varying degrees of patience 
for the departure signal. 

Curtis Delman had been intro- 
duced to each of them in turn. 
Of the four, only Walter Pel- 
linger, President of Galactic 
Stores, had made a previous trip. 
The lawyer knew of him by rep- 
utation as a shrewd businessman, 
but there was little to be said in 
favor of his disposition, which 
was rumored to be morose and 
unfriendly. Certainly his appear- 
ance was surly enough to support 
the rumor. 

“Of course,” the Vice President 
was saying, “Mr. Curtis Delman 
and Mr. Pellinger have heard all 
this before, but I’m sure they’ll 
both forgive me for repeating it.” 
Walter Pellinger mumbled some- 
thing uncomplimentary. “And 
now for a last word about the 
ship. Most of you will have come 
here by space liner, and very 
comfortable it is, too. Unfortu- 
nately, we can’t look after you 
that well. Not only would it be 
uneconomical to employ a liner, 
it would also be impossible — 
there just aren’t the landing fa- 
cilities. And if you can’t land, 
there’s not much point in going, 
is there?” The Vice President 
laughed at his little joke. No one 
else seemed to find it amusing. 

“No,” he continued, “the best 
we can provide is a Stellano-type 



spaceboat — the very latest mod- 
el, naturally — but, even so, I’m 
afraid the men will have to share 
berths. Of course, there’s plenty 
of room in the lounge. As for the 
staff, Captain Ross, who is to 
look after you, is a man of con- 
siderable — ” 

The Vice President rambled on. 
Curtis Delman ceased listening 
to him; it was only because he 
had heard his name mentioned 
that his interest had been drawn 
in the first place. He focused his 
attention on the three remaining 
passengers. 

They we;re a strangely assorted 
trio. Of the two men, one was ex- 
travagantly attired in dark-blue 
silk, obviously hand-woven, with 
large sapphire rings on the fingers 
of both hands, and a slim, eight- 
dial chronometer on the left 
wrist. Despite his advanced age, 
his face remained lean and swar- 
thy, the eyes set close above a 
strong hooked nose, the lips taut 
and cruel. 

He’d been introduced as Jason 
Tarsh. The lawyer seemed to 
associate the name with a crimi- 
nal case — something to do with 
smuggling — but the details elud- 
ed him. 

The other was ordinary and ill 
at ease, a plump, red-faced man 
in a badly cut tweed tunic who 
looked out of place in the present 
company. His knuckles rapped 
nervously on the elbow-rest of 



RICH LIVING 



123 



his chair. Clearly, Mr. John 
Bridge had none of that confi- 
dence usually acquired by the 
millionaire. Yet only a wealthy 
man could afford the trip. Curtis 
Delman was puzzled. 

And then there was the woman. 

TT was difficult to believe that 
the third and last of his fel- 
low-passengers was Gillian Mur- 
ray. She sat by herself in the far 
corner, a formless, shrunken 
creature in deep black. He re- 
membered seeing her, eighty 
years ago, on the stage of the 
Palladia. She had been shapely 
and vivacious in those days. Now 
only a faint sparkle lingered in 
her eyes. There was nothing to 
suggest that she had once been 
the toast of the Universe. Old, 
withered, gray-haired — time 
treated beauty harshly, merci- 
lessly. He realized how much this 
trip must mean to her. 

“Unlike Jupiter,” the Vice 
President was saying, “this sec- 
tion of the Galaxy is composed 
of oxygen planets. In fact, the 
proportion of oxygen is rather 
higher than on Earth, so you 
needn’t bother about spacesuits 
and the like. I remember — ” 

A green light blinked on the 
Vice President’s desk, stemming 
the flood of reminiscence. It was 
the embarkation signal. 

The Vice President rose. “It 
only remains,” he said, “to wish 



you all a very happy and suc- 
cessful journey.” 

The handshaking over, the five 
passengers filed out onto the es- 
calator. Below them, by the side 
of the Terminal Building, lay 
the spaceboat, a slim, cone- 
shaped vessel, gleaming in the 
artificial light. They all tottered 
on board. 

Clearance was granted almost 
immediately. Slowly, they passed 
through the main airlock and 
into the open. It was dark out- 
side and only the change in ele- 
vation told them that they were 
climbing the launching ramp. 
Behind them, the huge inverted 
bowl of the city glowed in her- 
metic splendor. Movement 
ceased. The warning indicator 
flashed on: LIE BACK AND 
FASTEN SAFETY HARNESS. 
A steward checked their posi- 
tions. 

They lay, tensed and motion- 
less, waiting for the sudden 
thrust that would hurl them into 
space. 

TT was the two-hundred-and- 
twentieth day. 

As Curtis Delman returned to 
consciousness, his first feeling 
was of relief. The cumulative 
strain of one takeoff after an- 
other could prove disastrous. It 
was one of the drawbacks to a 
spaceboat that the effect of rapid 
acceleration should be so marked. 



124 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



In a liner, the takeoff was little 
more than an inconvenience — 
and, despite exhaustive tests, 
there was no telling how an old 
heart would react to a series of 
blackouts. Now the danger no 
longer existed, for in thirty days 
they would arrive at Rejuvenal. 
As for the journey back, he 
would make it with the heart of 
a young man. 

He unclipped the safety har- 
ness and lowered his legs over 
the side of the bunk. 

He had no wish to remain in 
his cabin. It was too small for 
comfort, though, like all Stellano 
products, superbly designed. Not 
an inch had been wasted. Per- 
sonal luggage was stowed under 
the bunk, cupboards were built 
in, tables folded back and even 
the basin was retractable. Every 
conceivable necessity had been 
crammed into a few square feet. 

When he reached the lounge, 
he found the others already seat- 
ed. 

There were two vacant chairs, 
one next to John Bridge, the 
other between Tarsh and Pel- 
linger. He chose the former. 

“So you survived?” said Pel- 
linger. He sounded disappointed. 

“Yes, I survived,” replied Del- 
man. “And sinqe we appear to be 
exercising our powers of observa- 
tion, I hope the same may be said 
of you?” 

Gillian Murray laughed. Wal- 



ter Pellinger opened his mouth as 
if to make some retort, then 
thought better of it, and turned 
back to the vidar screen. 

The screen took up most of the 
far wall. The image in focus was 
the scene behind them. In the 
center, like a giant grapefruit, 
hung the planet Algon — a world 
of water with a few islands dot- 
ting the surface of an ocean — 
while anchored in space, some 
hundreds of miles above, lay a 
small satellite. 

“That’s a funny one,” said 
John Bridge. 

The lawyer smiled. He’d grown 
to like Bridge. The mystery of 
his wealth had been discovered 
months ago — he’d won a sweep- 
stake fortune. That a*»d his own 
meager savings had together 
proved just sufficient to buy him 
a new lease of life. His family 
hadn’t liked the idea; but, as he’d 
pointed out to them, it was his 
money and what use was it to 
him if he was too old to enjoy it? 
The simplicity and good nature 
of the man came as a refreshing 
change from the sullenness of 
Pellinger and the cynicism of Ja- 
son Tarsh. 

“It’s a radio-platform,” Del- 
man explained. 

S OMETIMES it seemed- al- 
most incredible that John 
Bridge had never left the Earth. 
He was a Londoner by birth and, 



RICH LIVING 



125 



before this trip, had traveled no 
farther than New York. To him, 
everything they saw and did was 
a new adventure. 

“But we don’t have radio-plat- 
forms back home,” Bridge said. 
“Why do they need them here?” 

“In our own solar system,” 
Delman told him, “there’s an in- 
terplanetary link-up — an expen- 
sive business — but we did have 
them four hundred years ago. 
Out here, it’s not worth the cost. 
The platform acts as a go-be- 
tween. It can intercept messages 
and pass them down to the 
spacedrome on Algon, or it can 
transmit to a spaceship in flight. 
But direct contact between 
spaceship and spacedrome is im- 
possible, because the ionized 
layer of the atmosphere deflects 
the radio waves.” 

“I see. Is there one over Re- 
juvenal, then?” 

“I don’t think so. At least, 
there wasn’t when I was last 
there. It doesn’t really warrant it. 
There’s only the house and a 
small landing-ground. And a 
spaceboat arrives and departs 
every thirty days, so nothing can 
happen.” 

“What about boots? Do we 
have to wear them?” 

“You mean gravity-boots?” 
Delman asked. 

Walter Pellinger scowled irri- 
tably and shifted his position. 
“Yes, I suppose so — those heavy 



things we wore on Borenius and 
Ziar.” 

Delman shook his head. “No, 
curiously enough, we don’t. It’s 
only a tertiary planet — less than 
one-eighth of Earth’s volume— 
but its specific gravity is enor- 
mous. Rejuvenite, the rock it’s 
composed of, is one of the heavi- 
est minerals ever discovered. 
They say — ” 

“Look, Delman,” Walter Pel- 
linger interrupted, “let that 
blasted man wear his boots, if 
he wants to. I’m sure I don’t 
care. But for heaven’s sake, stop 
this geological survey! It’s bad 
enough being cooped up in this 
tub without having to listen to a 
lot of nursery small-talk.” 

“Gosh, I’m sorry, Mr. Pellin- 
ger — ” John Bridge began. 

“I wasn’t talking to you,” said 
Pellinger curtly, “but, since 
you’ve chosen to butt in, I’ll say 
this — you don’t belong here. 
You’re a stupid, ignorant lout, 
and if you worked in any of my 
stores, which could never happen 
in the first place, I’d fire you on 
the spot and the idiot who hired 
you, too.” 

“Aren’t you being a little un- 
just?” Curtis Delman spoke soft- 
ly, but there was an edge of 
underlying menace in his voice.

Pellinger had overstepped the 
boundaries of acceptable behav-

ior. That he despised John 
Bridge, he had made clear from 
the beginning. Now he had come 
into the open. They all looked at 
him. Tarsh, who was nearest, 
seemed to find it amusing. 

“I’ve got nothing against you, 
Delman.” Pellinger picked his 
words carefully. “You worked 
your passage like the rest of us, 
but that fellow — ” he pointed to- 
ward John Bridge — “has no right 
to be here at all. He’s a nitwit 
and a nobody. You’re a success 
and I’m a success. It’s not luck, 
Delman; we both have ability. 
Call it natural selection, if you 
like. 

“Darwin did. We’ve fought 
for the chance to prolong our 
lives and, by doing so, we’re able 
to marry again and have children 
and pass that ability down to 
them. Why, our lives are essen- 
tia/ to the human race!” 

“I should have thought there 
were sufficient chain-store mag- 
nates,” said Tarsh. 

Walter Pellinger turned on 
him. “Don’t tempt me, Jason. 
Your activities on Neptune and 
Arcturus won’t bear close inves- 
tigation.” 

Jason Tarsh smiled and re- 
mained silent. There was little 
humor in his smile. That last re- 
mark had done much to heighten 
his opinion of Walter Pellinger. 

“To return to my point,” Pel- 
linger continued, “that man won 



a sweepstake. He’s here not be- 
cause he’s intelligent, but because 
he’s lucky, the somethng-for- 
nothing principle. A fat lot of use 
that is to the Universe. Why, his 
descendants will be as stupid as 
himself and there’s no room for 
the manual laborer in this Age. 
It’s an intolerable waste.” 

“If I thought you believed any 
of that,” said Delman, “I should 
be the first to respect your feel- 
ings. But we’ve been ‘cooped up’ 
together, to use your expression, 
for seven months and I know you 
better than your shareholders do. 
Oh, yes, you can put it across at 
a Board Meeting, this lofty idea 
of self-sacrifice and the sum of 
human good; but it isn’t true and 
you know it. You’re here for the 
same reason I’m here — because 
you’re afraid to die. And that 
goes for all of us.” He looked at 
each of them in turn, as if daring 
them to contradict him. “Yes, 
we’ve got ability, all right, and 
self-confidence. But what do we 
do with these fancied qualities? 
We use them to make money 
with which to buy back our 
youth.” 

T"|ELMAN got to his feet and 
hobbled over toward the vi- 
dar screen. He stood with his 
back to the screen, looking down 
on them. 

“And what do we do with our 
youth?” he asked. “We use that 



RICH LIVING 



127 



to make money for our old age. 
We have no choice. Not only is 
the price of rejuvenation extor- 
tionate in itself, but also, by a 
whim of the legislature, we are 
declared dead and the burden of 
‘death duty’ falls on our estates. 
When we return, we return poor. 
And so the cycle continues — the 
endless quest for money, the 
means of perpetual preservation. 

“We are careers, not men and 
women!” the lawyer went on ve- 
hemently. “We don’t enjoy life. 
We have neither the time nor the 
courage to enjoy it. Our children 
are few and we ignore them, for 
should they inherit this terrible 
urge, they would be our competi- 
tors. No, Mr. Pellinger, there is 
only one real man among us and 
that is John Bridge. He alone has 
enjoyed life and he goes back de- 
termined to enjoy it for a second 
and last time. But we, by dint of 
work and learning and sharp- 
practice, may prolong the agony 
once again. Ours are the wasted 
lives.” 

“Oh, Mr. Delman! Surely, 
that’s overstating the case?” Gil- 
lian Murray had the reedy voice 
common to so many elderly spin- 
sters. “What about all those diffi- 
cult problems you’ve solved? 
Many of them are of great im- 
portance. Everybody says so.” 

“Then I don’t agree with ev- 
erybody, Miss Murray,” Delman 
replied. “Complications are the 



bread and butter of my trade. 
We make them for money and 
we unravel them for more mon- 
ey. One day, you draft a will; 
the next, you break a Trust deed 
— the balance remains even. It’s 
true you perform a function, but 
it’s questionable whether that 
function is of any real value.” 
John Bridge got up from his 
chair. His rubicund features were 
creased in bewilderment. 

“This is beyond me,” he said. 
“I’m sorry if I annoyed Mr. Pel- 
linger. I didn’t mean to. I think 
I’ll take a nap.” 

He walked thoughtfully out 
into the corridor, a book in his 
left hand, his right arm stretched 
out to the handrail overhead. 

“There’s something about Mr. 
Bridge,” Gillian Murray said re- 
flectively, “that reminds me of 
the Statue of Liberty.” 

“Probably the hollow head,” 
said Jason Tarsh. 

IT was ninety years since the 
lawyer had last seen Rejuve- 
nal. And now, after all those dec- 
ades of unremitting toil, he saw 
it again — a small purple blob on 
the vidar screen, a hundred thou- 
sand miles away — a blob that 
would grow and grow until it 
filled the entire screen. Soon the 
distant harmony of light and 
shade would break up, throwing 
into relief the jagged peaks and 
plunging crevices that formed the 



128 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



surface of the planet. 

He watched it, fascinated, won- 
dering whether this approach 
was to be his last, or whether he 
would be asking himself the same 
questions a thousand years to 
come. Perhaps it was this mo- 
ment above all others that made 
the endless months of scraping 
and self-sacrifice suddenly worth- 
while. 

“It won’t run away,” said a 
voice beside him. He turned his 
head. Gillian Murray stood there, 
wrinkled and benign, her keen 
blue eyes regarding him with 
quizzical humor. 

“I’m so sorry,” he said. “I 
didn’t know you were here.” 

“Oh, don’t apologize, Mr. Del- 
man. It’s just that you’ve seen it 
all before, so I’m the one who 
should be excited.” 

The lawyer nodded. “Yes,” he 
admitted, “ you’ve got something 
to be excited about. Years ago, 
longer than either of us would 
want to remember, I saw you on 
the stage. It was one of the im- 
portant moments in my life. You 
see, before then, I’d always re- 
garded ‘beauty’ and ‘perfection’ 
as abstract qualities. I was 
wrong. Are you going back to the 
theatre?” 

Gillian Murray paused for a 
moment. “No,” she replied final- 
ly. “I did intend to and, after 
your flattery, I almost feel I 
should, but I’ve been thinking 



over what you said a few weeks 
back — you know, about us being 
careers rather, than flesh and 
blood. Mind you, I don’t agree 
completely; we’re not as bad as 
all that. No, it’s more the feeling 
that I’ve lived one sort of life 
and it would be stupid to repeat 
the same thing over again. This 
time, I’d like to marry and have 
a family and settle down — all the 
ordinary things. Does that sound 
sensible?” 

“Very sensible,” said Curtis 
Delman. 

HPHEIR eyes strayed back to 
the vidar screen. The planet 
had grown larger. Already it was 
possible to make out the rippling 
serrulation of contours. Another 
hour and the spaceboat would 
rest motionless on the purple 
rock. 

“Somehow it’s frightening — ” 
Gillian Murray shivered — “the 
idea that Nature can work back 
to front, reverse the aging proc- 
ess.” 

“It’s not an idea,” he said. “It’s 
a fact.” 

“Yes, I know,” she replied, 
“but it’s still uncanny. I’ve so 
many doubts. I mean will I real- 
ly look the same? And my mind? 
Oh, they’ve told me there’s no 
change — but there must be!” She 
buried her head in her hands. 

Delman looked at her with 



RICH LIVING 



129 



compassion. “You needn’t wor- 
ry,” he said. “Nothing can go 
wrong. The memory remains un- 
impaired; it’s only the ability to 
make use of it that suffers — the 
knowledge is at your disposal. 
You’ll be just like other young 
people, heedless and disinclined 
to profit from experience. You 
see, the mind is like a machine; 
you press the right buttons and it 
draws the right conclusion. The 
buttons are the facts to be con- 
sidered and their selection is a 
matter of judgment. When we’re 
young, our judgment is often at 
fault. When we’re very young, 
we can’t reason at all. There’s 
nothing to fear — only youthful 
exuberance.” 

Before she could answer, the 
loudspeaker buzzed twice. There 
was a moment of silence, broken 
by the voice of Captain Ross. 

“Attention, please! Attention, 
please! Will all passengers kind- 
ly retire to their cabins. The for- 
ward jets will be fired in exactly 
five minutes. I repeat, will all 
passengers — ” 

I T was cool on the veranda, 
though outside, an alien sun 
beat down on the smooth ex- 
panse of runway, a narrow plat- 
form, less than a mile in length 
— the only flat stretch of land on 
the planet. Along the far edge, 
mountains, bathed in sunlight, 



rose in barren splendor, their 
sharp peaks reaching for the sky, 
while, on each remaining side, 
the ground dropped sheer away, 
to reform itself in twisting val- 
leys thousands of feet below. 

The house, two stories of pre- 
fabricated metal, stood perched 
on one of the outer corners. Op- 
posite, packed tightly against the 
rock face, the emergency hangar 
rose in a gentle curve — a sheen 
of aluminum in contrast with the 
purple background of rejuvenite. 
Between them, the launching 
ramp stretched lengthwise down 
the runway, inclining steeply for 
the first fifty feet, then leveling 
out so that the cruel blast of the 
takeoff would be dispersed harm- 
lessly over the edge of the preci- 
pice. 

A few small store sheds were 
the only other signs of habitation. 

It was too hot to do anything 
constructive. They relaxed in 
their deck-chairs, grateful for the 
way in which the fans moved the 
monotonous heat into unexpect- 
ed currents of warm air. 

Walter Pellinger looked up- 
ward expectantly, a sudden 
movement that caused the little 
beads of perspiration on his head 
to run together and course down 
his neck in a steady stream. He 
ran a handkerchieif around the 
inside of his collar. 

“What’s the time?” he asked. 

“Quarter past ten,” said Tarsh.

“All right, Jason, you’ve had 
your fun. Now perhaps you’ll 
consult the right dial. We’d all 
like to know.” 

“I can never get used to these 
five-hour days,” said Gillian 
Murray. “It makes one feel so 
restless.” 

Curtis Delman frowned in 
mock reproof. The lawyer was in 
his prime, the natural strength 
of his features enhanced by the 
iron-gray hair and powerful 
physique. 

“Really, Gillian,” he said, “you 
ought to be thankful it’s sum- 
mer. At least, you’ve got three 
hours of daylight.” 

“Well, I can’t understand it,” 
said John Bridge. “We’ve been 
here sixty Earth days and the 
sun always sets at the same 
time.” 

“Nonsense,” Delman replied. 
“It’s been later each day. Though 
not much, I grant you. Remem- 
ber, summer still has nine years 
to run.” 

“Will someone please tell me 
the time?” said Walter Pellinger. 

Jason Tarsh regarded him with 
approval. “That’s much better. 
It’s two o’clock.” 

O F the five of them, John 
Bridge and Jason Tarsh 
were the least changed. True, 
that ‘lucky fool,’ as Walter Pel- 
linger called Bridge, had lost a 
good deal of weight and his face 



was not quite so full as it had 
been, but it was the same John 
Bridge who had climbed on board 
at Jupiter. The change in Jason 
Tarsh was even less marked. 
Time had ironed out a few 
creases here and there, and his 
back was straighter. But, apart 
from that, he looked the same at 
fifty as he had at a hundred — 
gaunt, resilient and merciless. 

“It’s due anytime now,” said 
Walter Pellinger, his eyes still 
fixed on the empty segment of 
horizon above the near end of the 
runway. 

The others remained silent. 
The lawyer imagined that they 
were all thinking of the incoming 
spaceboat. The landing today 
was something like a dress-re- 
hearsal for their own departure 
in thirty days. It broke the te- 
dium of their existence and with 
it would come a change of staff, 
the- unloading of supplies 
and the news from home. But 
when the next landing took place, 
they themselves would be waiting, 
young and eager, to go back and 
start life afresh. 

Gillian Murray was looking 
toward the door behind them, 
her lovely profile turned in his 
direction. He followed the line of 
her gaze. There, in the hallway, 
stood the two house servants, 
man and wife. They had both ar- 
rived on the relief spaceboat a 
month ago, a comfortable, mid- 



R I C H LIVING 



131 



dle-aged couple. Now they were 
almost like children, leaping up 
and down with impatience, 
counting every second which 
brought Captain Ross nearer — 
young, graceful creatures, hand 
in hand, reunited in their youth. 

Delman found himself smiling 
in sympathy. “Yes,” he said, 
“those are the vital years.” 

“I was just thinking the same 
thing.” She turned to him. There 



were tears of happiness in her 
eyes. At that moment, he caught 
a glimpse of her real beauty, 
something deeper than the mere- 
ly physical — a purity of expres- 
sion mirrored from within, clear 
and composed, like a reflection of 
the soul. 

“There it is!” Walter Pellinger 
announced excitedly. He pointed. 

Out in the distance, a small 
speck hurtled toward them. Soon 




GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION

it would streak low overhead, un- 
til a final burst from the jets 
brought it to a halt at the far end 
of the runway. 

The two young servants could 
restrain themselves no longer. 
Oblivious to danger, they began 
to run down the side of the land- 
ing-strip, racing toward a spot 
parallel to where they knew the 
spaceboat would draw to a stand- 
still. 



It was John Bridge who no- 
ticed them. The others were all 
looking in the opposite direction. 
He leaped to his feet and dashed 
outside. 

“Come back!” he yelled. “For 
God’s sake, come back! You’ll 
get caught by the blast!” 

T HEY were so intent that they 
paid no heed to him. He ran 
on after them, trying to make

himself heard, forgetful of his 
own peril. 

“Look!” The strong fingers of 
Jason Tarsh dug deep into the 
lawyer’s arm. Delman turned in- 
stinctively. Nearly four hundred 
yards away, three figures stum- 
bled back toward the house. 

“It’s too late,” Delman said. 
“Get down, all of you! If Ross 
sees them, he may try to over- 
shoot. If he’s going too slowly, 
he’ll have to use the rear jets and 
they might splash us. Get down!” 

They flattened themselves out 
on the floor of the veranda. 

Above them, the thin whine of 
the approaching craft switched 
into a deep roar, then cut out 
almost instantly. 

Delman saw the flash of silver 
overhead as the spaceboat fought 
to recover altitude. One moment, 
it was climbing; the next, it 
veered sharply to the left and hit 
the cliff. 

Sound and light combined, 
deafening and dazzling, as the 
force of the explosion thrust out- 
ward, tearing at the foundations 
of the house itself. 

When the hail of falling rock 
had died away, they got up and 
looked around them. It was dif- 
ficult to determine the extent of 
the damage, for dust swirled and 
eddied in all directions. Only 
gradually did the details emerge 
from the surrounding mist. 

The crash had caused a small 



avalanche. Rubble littered the 
smooth width of the runway. Of 
the spaceboat, there was nothing 
to be seen but a scar on the 
mountainside. 

John Bridge and the two serv- 
ants had vanished. 

“That crazy old fool,” said 
Walter Pellinger. “I might have 
known he’d mess things up.” 

“It wasn’t him,” Gillian Mur- 
ray replied. “I think it was the 
servants. I’m sure I heard him 
shout a warning at them.” 

“You think! You think!” Wal- 
ter Pellinger shook his head vig- 
orously from side to side. His 
ears were still ringing from the 
blast. “He’s dead, Miss Murray. 
You hear me? He’s dead! He 
doesn’t need a champion now!” 
Gillian Murray flushed. “Why, 
you ungrateful — ” 

“Shut up, both of you!” said 
Jason Tarsh angrily. “Can’t you 
see there’s work to be done? 
We’ve got to clear the runway.” 
Curtis Delman left the ve- 
randa rail and came toward 
them. “And just how do you pro- 
pose to do that, Mr. Tarsh?” he 
asked quietly. 

A LL of them looked at the 
lawyer in amazement. Jason 
Tarsh laughed derisively. 

“Listen to him!” he exclaimed. 
“The Great Man! Wants to know 
how you remove a few small 
stones!” 



134 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“You damned idiot!” said Del- 
man savagely.- “Use your eyes! 
Why were this house and the 
storage sheds prefabricated? Just 
for the hell of it? Dozens of use- 
less trips when you could build 
what you wanted from rock? 
Until today, there wasn’t a loose 
pebble in this godforsaken place! 
Didn’t that strike you as odd? 
Well, didn’t it?” 

Tarsh made no reply. 

The lawyer moved back to the 
veranda rail. “There!” he said, 
pointing at a near-lying stone the 
size of a tennis ball. “Go ahead, 
try your strength. Throw it over 
the side!” 

Uncertainly, Jason Tarsh 
walked into the open. They 
watched him as he bent down to 
pick up the small purple lump. 
For nearly a minute, he strained 
and tugged at the dead, unyield- 
ing weight in front of him. Then, 
slowly, he straightened up and 
returned to the veranda. 

“You’re right,” he said grudg- 
ingly. “I couldn’t lift it.” 

Delman nodded. “Considering 
it’s more than ten times the 

weight of lead, that’s not surpris- 

• „ »» 
mg. 

“Anyhow, there’s one consola- 
tion,” said Jason Tarsh. “We 
weren’t on that spaceboat.” 

The lawyer regarded him with 
pity. “No, we weren’t,” he said, 
“but whether it’s a consolation 
remains to be seen.” 



“What are you driving at?” 
demanded Walter Pellinger. 
“They’ll send a rescue party. 
They must know there’s some- 
thing wrong.” 

“Oh, yes,” Delman agreed. “But 
they don’t know what and we 
can’t tell them. And, even if they 
did know, what could they do?” 
He began to stroll up and down 
the veranda. “As far as they’re 
concerned, Ross hasn’t reported 
to Algon. Perhaps his transmitter 
failed. Perhaps he blew up in 
space. There are plenty of possi- 
bilities. If they treat the matter 
as an emergency, the relief boat 
may get here in twenty-eight 
days instead of thirty. But it 
can’t land and it can’t hover, so 
what good is it to us?” 

“Now wait, Delman. You know 
the reputation of Rejuvenal En- 
terprises. A company like that 
can’t afford to take a risk. They’ll 
send for a patrol ship — ” 

“And those patrol ships are 
equipped with heli-cars,” Tarsh 
interjected. “They can launch a 
couple and pick us up in no time. 
It’s not difficult.” 

Pellinger nodded in agreement. 
“There you are. And Jason ought 
to know; he’s spent most of his 
life dodging them.” 

T'kELMAN looked at Tarsh 
with distaste. “I remember 
now. You were the man who 
shipped girls to Mercury and got 



RICH LIVING 



135 



run in under Section 7 of the 
White Slavery Act. Ten years, 
wasn’t it?” 

“That’s right,” Jason Tarsh 
answered, “but there’s no need to 
be nasty about it. Just fulfilling 
the old commercial custom of 
supply and demand.” His thin 
lips broke into a smile. “Know 
what they used to call me in the 
camps? ‘The Miner’s Best 
Friend.’ Nice of them, eh?” 

“Was it? They gave the same 
name to their canaries in the old 
days — and most of those were 
killed by fire-damp. But to get 
back to your mythical patrol 
ship — where do you expect it to 
come from? You know as well as 
I do, they keep to the main 
spaceways. We’re tucked away in 
a remote corner of the Galaxy. 
There’s one chance in a thousand 
that a patrol ship is within forty- 
five days of here.” 

The color drained from Walter 
Pellinger’s face. “Why forty- 
five?” he whispered. 

The lawyer paused before re- 
plying. They were grouped 
around him in a half-circle, three 
frightened people waiting for an 
answer, yet knowing in their 
hearts what that answer would 
be. 

He shrugged. “I should have 
thought it was obvious,” he said. 
“Qf course, I’ve no wish to alarm 
you and there is a method that 
might get us out of here, but 



we’ve got to face the facts. I was 
the only one among you whose 
legs had already begun to fail, so 
it’s safe to assume I’m the old- 
est inhabitant. In forty-five days, 
I shall be ten— the rest of you 
will be less — and I can’t guaran- 
tee to look after you any longer 
than that.” He fell silent, allow- 
ing the implication to sink in. 

“Seven million dollars!” cried 
Walter Pellinger. “I’ve paid sev- 
en million dollars just to die!” 
He began to laugh hysterically. 

“Stop it, you fool!” Jason 
Tarsh caught him by the shoul- 
ders and began to shake him 
violently. “You’ve paid seven 
million dollars to die young. 
Why, you ought to be tickled 
pink. Remember the slogan of 
Galactic Stores — ‘Originality is 
the Test of Taste!’ ” 

Gillian Murray seized the law- 
yer’s hand. “Curtis, you said 
something about a method.” 

He pointed at the emergency 
hangar over on the far side. 
“There’s a lifeboat in there. It 
may have been damaged by the 
blast, so don’t pin your hopes on 
it. But if we can shift the loose 
stones and get the doors open, 
we’ll soon know.” 

Arm in arm, they walked 
across the landing strip. 

T | ''WICE the relief boat shot low 
over the runway, sweeping 
round in a gigantic circle. Then 



136 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



it changed course and climbed 
steeply into the stratosphere. 
They watched it disappear out 
of sight — the last link with the 
world they knew. 

In the center of the landing 
strip, a dense column of smoke 
billowed up from a pile of smol- 
dering moss — a warning that no 
pilot could fail to observe. In the 
stillness, it rose in a tall spiral, 
twisting and turning, signaling to 
the winds. 

“You should’ve let it land.” 
Walter Pellinger was almost in 
tears; he blinked miserably. 

T^ELMAN had never pictured 
him like this, small, myopic, 
with fair hair and sloping shoul- 
ders. The structure of his eyes 
had changed during the inter- 
vening weeks and the contact 
lenses he’d worn until recently 
were quite useless to him. Now, 
at twenty-one, he was half-blind 
and of little practical help to 
them. 

“They didn’t stand a chance,” 
the lawyer replied. 

“Oh, but they did! On the Law 
of Probability, they had one in 
sixty-seven — and our lives are 
worth a thousand of theirs.” 
“Yes, I know. Our lives are 
essential to humanity. You’ve 
said it all before and I still dis- 
agree with you.” 

“Have I? I don’t remember.” 
“You have. But it doesn’t mat- 



ter. Come on back. We’ve gob to 
clear those stones. There aren’t 
. many left.” 

As he strode toward the hang- 
ar, the lawyer knew that the days 
were running short. True, the 
launching ramp was intact and 
one door of the hangar was al- 
ready open; but it would take at 
least a week to remove the 
chunks of rejuvenite blocking the 
remaining door. Tarsh and him- 
self had done most of the heavy 
work. Yet even Tarsh, with all 
his feline strength, was begin- 
ning to tire. The constant effort 
to make use of every scrap of 
daylight was proving too much 
for them. 

According to Gillian, the life- 
boat was unharmed. Delman 
hadn’t the time to inspect it 
properly. But the very position 
of the hangar, squeezed tight 
against the cliffside, had given it 
the best protection possible. No, 
if only they could remove those 
stones! 

Delman exhaustedly picked up 
his discarded crowbar. He in- 
serted the point under a slab of 
rejuvenite, thrust down and pried 
with all his strength. As it tilted, 
Gillian Murray forced chocks of 
metal underneath to hold it in 
place. The teamwork was repeat- 
ed time after time, until at last 
the slab toppled over, gaining 
them another twelve inches. 
They rested for a moment. Then

the whole endless process started 
once again. 

By dusk, they had removed 
five stones. 

FINISHED eating, they re- 
*■ laxed in the living room, lying 
back in the padded comfort of 
the aripchairs. Only Jason Tarsh 
remained standing — slim and 
compact, like a young Oriental 
despot — his eyes fixed on Walter 
Pellinger. 

Pellinger squirmed uncomfort- 
ably in his seat. “I think I’ll try 
and get some sleep,” he said. 

“Just a moment, Walter,” 
Tarsh lifted a restraining hand. 
“You’re a businessman and I 
want your advice. It’s quite a 
simple problem. Imagine that 
four of your employees are 
stranded on a desert island with 
very little food. And suppose 
they all agree to build a raft on 
which to escape and get back to 
the head office — what you might 
call a ‘joint venture.’ Now let us 
also suppose that three of those 
people work hard, cut down trees 
and fashion them into planks, 
gather creepers and braid them 
into ropes, and generally do all 
they can to further the common 
purpose. But the fourth, Walter 
— and this is the point — the 
fourth does nothing. He eats the 
food — Company food, mind you! 
— so urgently needed to keep up 
the strength of the — ” 



“Why do you keep picking on 
me? I do all I can.” Walter Pel- 
linger got out of his chair. 

“You?” said Jason Tarsh, af- 
fecting amazement. “Who said 
anything about you? Why, you’re 
the last person I’d criticize. But 
I see you wish to leave the love- 
birds to themselves, so let’s fin- 
ish our little chat outside. It’s a 
fine night.” He steered the un- 
willing Pellinger out onto the 
veranda. 

“Well, shall we take a hint and 
move over to the settee?” Gillian 
Murray suggested. 

Delman watched with admira- 
tion as she crossed the room, 
clean-limbed and graceful, her 
long red hair falling from the 
crown of her head in a soft cas- 
cade. 

“Never be discourteous to the 
cook,” he replied. “That was one 
of my earliest lessons. And, 
heaven knows, you’re an unusu- 
ally attractive cook. It gives one 
an appetite just to look at you.” 
He got up to join her — a bearded 
giant, tall and deep-chested, like 
the heroes of the Viking sagas. 

“What will you do when we get 
back?” she asked. 

“Marry and get some job that 
won’t take me away from you. 
Does that meet with your ap- 
proval?” 

“Yes,” she said. “If that’s a 
proposal, it will do nicely.” 

They kissed with all the in- 



138 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tensity of young love, losing in 
their embrace the dread of time 
which swept them toward their 
childhood. 

“Curtis,” she said quietly, 
“have we any hope? Please be 
honest!” 

TTIS fingers brushed the back 
of her neck lightly, up and 
down, not altering their tender 
rythm. 

“Not much,” he said without 
emotion. 

“Jason was right about the 
food. There’s’ very little left; the 
supplies were on the spaceboat. 

You’re all hungry. I know you 
»» 

are. 

“It’s not only that, darling. 
Sleep is just as important. But we 
can’t spare the time. Every day 
now, we’ll be growing physically 
weaker and the same job will 
soon take us twice as long. 
There’s so much to do. And we’ve 
got to plan all of it in advance, 
while our minds are still adult.” 

“Is that why you’ve got the 
recording machine down here?” 

“It may sound idiotic,” he said, 
“but I can’t remember my boy- 
hood — it was four hundred years 
ago. Today, I’m twenty-five, 
you’re twenty, and Walter is 
somewhere between the two of us. 
Jason, I’m sure, is less — how 
much, I don’t know. The fact is 
that we’ll be children before we 
leave — that is, if we leave — and 



we’ll only be able to understand 
the simple things. So it seemed 
essential to clarify the lifeboat in- 
structions; the manual would be 
complete nonsense to a child. Of 
course, I’ve added some general 
advice as it occurred to me.” 

Gillian sighed. “I don’t think 
I’ll like being married to you,” 
she said. “You think of every- 
thing. May I switch on the re- 
cording machine?” 

“Go ahead,” he replied. “It will 
take a few seconds to warm up, 
though.” 

She kissed him lightly, then 
uncurled herself and went over 
to the recorder. The purr of the 
machine gradually increased in 
pitch until it passed from the 
range of human hearing. The 
silence was broken by his own 
voice. 

“Curtis!” it said, “Curtis! Do 
not touch the controls until you 
are sure that Gillian and Walter 
and Jason are all in the cabin. 
Are they all there? Good. Then 
pull the big lever toward you. 
Now—” 

Jason Tarsh entered the room 
and switched off the machine. 
“You can delete Walter,” he said. 
He began to ape the slow, earnest 
delivery of the recorder. “For he 
is a sill-y boy and fell o-ver the 
edge of the cliff.” He smiled and 
continued in normal tones, “Very 
unfortunate. Should never have 
left him alone, poor guy. Blind

as a bat. Oh, well, bigger break- 
fasts tomorrow. Good night.” 

TT was noon. The whole ledge 
-*■ shimmered in the sun, hazy 
and indistinct, as the rising cur- 
rents of air dispersed the light 
in a jumble of refracted motion. 

On the runway, between the 
hangar and the house, stood a 
nine-year-old boy. A small, mo- 
tionless figure, with a towel 
around his waist and his feet 
bandaged for protection against 
the blistering heat of the rock, 
he gazed up in triumph at the 
launching ramp. 

There, perched on the summit 
of the ramp, lay the squat, pow- 
erful bulk of the lifeboat. 

He turned and ran joyfully 
back to the house. “Jill!” he call- 
ed- “Jill, come and play! And 
bring Jason with you.” 

A little girl, her red hair un- 
brushed, stepped out onto the 
veranda. “Don’t want to bwing 
Jason,” she said, “He’s mean.” 
“You must bring Jason,” he in- 
sisted, “or you can’t play.” 

“What we going to play?” 

“ ‘Ships,’ ” he said. He pointed 
to the top of the launching ramp. 

Silently, the two children 
trudged across the rock-face and 
began to climb the steep slope of 
the ramp, leaning forward to re- 
tain their balance. Tucked up in 
a blanket in Gillian Murray’s 
arms, Jason Tarsh bawled hun-

grily. Higher and higher they 
climbed, the only living creatures 
in a purple world, striving to- 
ward their goal. Curtis Delman, 
hampered by the weight of the 
recording machine, kept urging 
her to keep up with him. Sudden- 
ly, she stopped. 

“Don’t want to play,” she said. 
“I’m tired.” She sat down on the 
hot metal of the ramp, placing 
the baby beside her. 

He let her rest for a few min- 
utes, then tried to coax her to 
carry on. “You’re a sissy,” he 
said. “You’re afraid!” 

Her eyes brimmed with tears'. 
“I’m not a sissy,” she cried. “I’m 
not! I’m not! I’m not\” 

Delman turned and continued 
climbing purposefully. “Gillian’s 
a sissy! Gillian’s a sissy!” he 
chanted over and over again. 

Panting with weariness and in- 
dignation, she struggled after 
him. 

They had covered more than 
half the distance before he looked 
back. He saw her following and 
prepared to go on again. Then he 
realized something was wrong 
and swung around, startled. Her 
hands were empty! 

“Where’s Jason?” he cried out. 

S HE was too exhausted to reply 
and stared at him blankly. 
Putting down the recording ma- 
chine, he ran past her. Some 
twenty yards away, the bundle of 



RICH LIVING 



141 



blanket that was Jason Tarsh be- 
gan to roll gently down the slope. 

He raced after it, his swift 
young legs moving as easily and 
painlessly as pistons. He reached 
the bundle just before the change 
in gradient which marked the 
first half of the ramp. Horrified, 
he increased his speed. Propelled 
by the sharp incline, the bundle 
branched off at a tangent. He 
caught it just as it was about to 
plunge over the side. When he 
picked up the blanket, it was curi- 
ously light. 

There was nothing inside it. 

Very slowly, he clambered back 
up the slope. 

As he came level with Gillian, 
he put his arm around her shoul- 
ders. “Don’t worry,” he said. 
“Jason was too small to play.” 
Taking her by the hand, he led 
her to the short, vertical ladder 
which led into the lifeboat. 

After the harsh glare of the sun, 
the cabin seemed dark and 
strange. What light there was was 
filtered through six small port- 
holes — three on either side — in 
which the glass was tinted a deep 
blue. 

It took him nearly ten minutes 
to strap Gillian into the safety 
harness, and by the time he had 
adjusted his own, she was asleep. 
He stretched out his right hand 
and switched on the recorder. 

“Curtis!” it began. 

Calmly, he carried out the in- 



structions. The deep, command- 
ing voice left nothing to chance. 

A pull on the master lever drew 
up the ladder and closed the 
hatch in hydraulic silence. The 
soft whistle of oxygen escaped 
from pressurized cylinders. An 
automatic transmitter broadcast 
an endless S.O.S. Deep in the 
heart of the lifeboat, dynamos 
pulsed with the throb of power. 

“Now, Curtis,” said the voice 
from the past, “turn the red 
switch in front of you to ‘Fixed 
Control.’ Have you turned the red 
switch to ‘Fixed Control’? Then 
lie back and fasten your safety 
harness as tight as you can. Have 
you done that?” 

“Yeah,” Curtis said, lying back. 
“You’ve done everything you 
had to do,” the voice continued. 
“Now shut your eyes and don’t 
move! Everything will be all 
right. The two of you will reach 
Earth. You don’t doubt that, do 
you?” 

“No,” said Curtis, closing his 
eyes and relaxing, reassured by 
the voice from the past. “I know 
we’ll get there.” 

“And the two of you will get 
married when you’re old enough. 
To each other, of course.” 

“Of course,” Curtis agreed. 
“Good luck!” said the voice. 
“Good luck to you both!” 

It clicked off then and the life- 
boat sped Earthward.

part of the reason. There is also 
the nuisance and embarrassment 
of having to spell unfamiliar 
names. 

And this applies not only to 
immigrants from Europe and 
Asia. Jim Thorpe and Col. Ely 
Samuel Parker were Indians. So 
was William Jacobs, otherwise 
known to us as Sitting Bull. 

In his chapter on clothing, 
Stewart says, “When we Earth- 
lings at last begin to colonize . 
whatever planet is next in line, 
we may find it already inhabited. 
... If so, it is to be hoped that 
we . assume that these na- 
tives are not altogether foolish in 
the adjustments that they have 
made to tjieir environment . 
Probably, of course, we . shall 
stick by our own clothing along 
with our other customs, and shall 
be vastly uncomfortable and die 
by thousands . Certainly we 
shall have the precedent of those 
first colonists who came to Amer- 
ica.” 

That precedent was a horrify- 
ing one; clad in outrageously un- 
suitable clothing, they died of 
exposure in the fierce New Eng- 
land winters, of sunstroke in the 
equally fierce Southern summers. 
If they had adopted Indian dress, 
they would have survived. But 
we have borrowed exactly one 
article of clothing from the In- 
dians — the moccasin! 



O NCE established, the pattern 
of a civilization remains re- 
markably fixed. While, elsewhere 
in the world, women were a drug 
on the market, they had great 
scarcity value in a frontier soci- 
ety. The situation has been com- 
pletely reversed, yet the attitude 
has not been changed. Philip 
Wylie, the noted thinker, incor- 
rectly attributes this to “Mom- 
ism.” An odd offshoot is the high 
rate of divorce and remarriage, 
which Stewart properly recog- 
nizes as idealism, not moral 
breakdown. 

On the basis of past rigidity, he 
feels we probably will not be any 
more flexible when we reach the 
other planets. I’m afraid he may 
be right. 

Wherever at all possible, we 
undoubtedly will cling to Earth- 
style ways of life, however wildly 
inadequate and even suicidal. 
Environment will dictate eating 
habits and choice of building ma- 
terials . ■. but mostly because 
of freight costs. 

On the positive side, though, 
this stubbornness forces us to 
alter environment to fit our ways 
of life — as with central heating 
and air conditioning — so the re- 
sult is an ultimate gain. 

Whether reader or writer, 
you’ll find that you can tunnel 
through this stimulating record 
of the past to glimpse the future.
