Secrets 
entrusted 
to a 
few 



THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man's mind \ and the 
mastery of life's problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by-mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

wisdom in their archives for centu-

IOU 



BY EDWARD WELLEN 

Illustrated by Goughon 



Eternity, ie not so very long . 

A few moments can span it — 
a second can destroy it forever! 



End-Around Carry 

A STRIPED paranoiac awn- 
ing flapped and billowed, 
deluding itself it was a Viking 
sail. Shadow and sunlight 
streaked across the face of the 
dying man. His eyes barely 
flickered awareness of the 
shifting. A priest looked sadly 
on ; the IOU obit key the man 
wore prevented the priest 
from attending him. 

A traffic administrator, his 
authority an invisible exten- 
sion of the radius of his arm, 
wiped the shoppers back in a 
semi-circle to provide landing 
space on the Mall. The pulse- 
band on the dying man’s wrist, 
having started sending the 



moment the pulse began to 
weaken, seemed to be beeping 
with greater urgency. 

A hum of vanes aloft evoked 
a hum of speculation below. 
Then the bystanders made out 
the insignia. The IOU last-aid 
man, beating out the ambu- 
lance as usual. 

The usual zealot howled 
“Blasphemer!” as the IOU 
man grounded and knelt be- 
side the dying man. 

The IOU man ignored the 
howling of the zealot, the 
sighing of the priest, and the 
caught breaths of the rest. He 
eyed the traffic administrator. 

The t.a. shrugged. “Just 
keeled over. Heart attack, I 
think.”

The IOU man unzipped his 
kit, pulled out his brainmeter 
and touched it to the skull of 
the dying man. He watched 
the indicator and at the same 
time kept half an eye out, not 
fretfully, for the ambulance. 
He could go ahead on his own 
discretion. He did. 

He took out his spray injec- 
tor and jetted a burst of tran- 
sistorized particles through an 
ear into the brain; then he 
thrust the dying man’s obit 
key, which hung from a gold 
chain about the neck, into the 
portable call box. 

At IOU headquarters the 
great computer snatched the 
dying man’s obit from the 
necrofile and transmitted the 
pattern to the transistorized 
particles in the man’s brain. 

The weather bureau had 
freshened the breeze and a 
scrap of stale newspaper rus- 
tled along like a leaf. An old 
headline — IOU DECLARES 
BIGGEST DIVIDEND YET 
— molded itself to the man’s 
face. A gasp from the squeam- 
ish, but the last-aider, concen- 
trating on his readings, failed 
to take notice. The t.a.’s eye 
silenced all. 

The last-aider looked up 
and smiled around. The dead 
man had made his heaven. 

The crowd sighed, all but 
priest and zealot in relief. 
The t.a. sighed. The IOU man 
sighed. All but priest and 
zealot were IOU subscribers. 

Now the IOU man saw the 
scrap of paper and reached to 

IOU 



remove it. But the wash of the 
slightly late ambulance tore it 
away, with what seemed to 
the squeamish a rip. 

I 

O N his way home Rush 
Tumulty dropped his last 
credit in a slot and reaped a 
bouquet of roses. HL life 
jingle- jangled with spurs of 
the moment. 

Home. The real estate 
agent, God pity his soul, had 
told them it was quaint and 
neighborly. At the touch of 
Rush’s key the door opened 
with a quaint creaking. (It 
made it easy for the neighbors 
to keep tabs on comings and 
goings.) 

Margaret had her eyes on 
the screen. She was reaching 
behind for the box of sweets 
on the table. Smiling, Rush 
put the roses into her groping 
hand. 

“Ouch!” 

The roses scattered. Mar- 
garet sucked her thumb. But 
no one could look at Rush and 
stay mad. 

The preset was switching 

/>V> n TVMoIq 

“Not another debate?” An- 
other investigation in the 
making ; the networks were on 
a public-service kick. 

Margaret spluttered indig- 
nant chocolate. “Not just an- 
other. There’ll be Neal Mc- 
Gillicuddy Cloy! He’s real 
good. You know?” 

“Ig.” 



7 




Neal McGillicuddy Cloy, 
professional optimist, doctor 
of business ethics, etc. Sicken- 
ing. But Cloy was a sales engi- 
neer of a sort. Might as well 
stick it out. Might garner a 
few tips. Sales engineers had 
to learn to suppress distaste 
for certain types. The most 
unpromising prospects some- 
times proved the most reward- 
ing clients. That was good 
business ethics. 

But then they announced 
the subject: Birth control. 

Avoid the issue. Rush 
dreamed of his big break and 
became aware of the program 
again only when it was end- 
ing. 

Whatever his stand had 
been, Cloy sat beaming at the 
fadeout. Why not? More peo- 
ple, bigger audience; fewer 
people, more elbow room for 
the chosen few. Pro and con, 
the world was getting better 
and better — for Cloy. 

Margaret was glowing. 
Rush started to say some- 
thing, but the commercial was 
so cute she shushed him. Then 
she turned to him. He tensed. 

“When’re we going to begin 
begetting? A boy and a girl. 
You know? How does that 
strike you?” 

“ ‘Strike’ — aggressive word. 
You feel unconscious hostility 
toward me.” 

Margaret said through her 
teeth, “I do not.” 

“See? Quarreling again. 
Bad atmosphere to raise kids 
in.” 



They sat apart, eyes unsee- 
ing on the screen, until a 
phone rang next door. 

Margaret stirred. “Like 
some punch?” 

H E gave a nod, but it was 
automatic. He eyed her 
as she swayed to the kitchen- 
ette on spike heels. Ringing 
was stimulus, response was 
“punch.” He smiled; the link- 
ing was clear. Bell . ring 
. come out fighting . 
punch. His smile faded. She 
was feeling hostile. He 
couldn’t blame her. He put on 
the smile as spike heels re- 
turned. They sat sipping. 

Rush was no good at fight- 
ing silence with silence. He 
fidgeted, emptied the glass in 
a gulp, banged it down, sprang 
to his feet and stomped out 
muttering not to wait up. 

He strode blindly, aware he 
was again precipitating a cri- 
sis by refusing to face a crisis. 
No, he was conquering his 
fear of rejection by rejecting 
the other first. No, he wasn’t 
rejecting Margaret but a way 
of life, the kind his father had 
led, resenting wife and child. 
No, it wasn’t so much resent- 
ment at them as at Fate; 
early photos showed a man 
alert for a different drum- 
ming, later — a man who’d 
committed himself to the hum- 
drum. No, he had to, or where 
would he be? Where the race, 
if everyone ran off chasing 
the sound of their own puls- 
ing?

EDWARD WEILEN 




No. Survival, even of the 
race, wasn’t enough. A man 
had to find meaning in being 
. or what’s an earth for 
anyway? 

Out of the tail of an eye 
Rush saw a gesture. Bill col- 
lector? He put purpose on his 
face and made the vanish- 
ing point his goal. Then he 
stopped. Will Wishart! No; 
Will, rest his kindly soul, had 
passed on. A family likeness, 
then; Will Wishart’s kid 
brother — what was the name? 
—Ken. 

“Hi-ya, Ken.” 

“You remember me?” 

“Will I ever forget?” 

They shook hands. Rush re- 
membered Ken dogging the 
heels of the big boys^always 
in the way unless the big boys 
wanted him to run an errand 
or retrieve a ball from a fero- 
cious yard or decoy while they 
stole fruit. Now Ken was a 
man and taller than himself. 
It made him feel old. It was 
funny to see Kenny, pros- 
perity on the outside and in- 
telligence shining through, 
suddenly becoming the hero- 
worshiping kid again. Rush 
straightened. 

“You haven’t changed, 
Rush.” 

“You sure have, Kenny.” 

“What’re you doing these 
days?” 

“I’m a missionary.” Really 
he was only a sales engineer, 
though he had once hoped to 
study for missionary work— 
breaking the ice for new prod- 

lOU 



ucts. And really only a jobless 
sales engineer at the moment. 
He was glad he’d always re- 
membered the importance of 
dressing well. 

“I knew you’d go places, 
Rush.” 

God ! What he’d wanted, 
and what places he was going! 

“Uh, you know, Rush, I 
wish I had a guy like you 
working with me.” 

R USH’S whole shortcoming 
had always seemed to 
him inability to maintain a 
delicate balance — not answer- 
ing too soon, not hesitating 
too long. He sucked in. “What 
do you have in mind, Ken?” 
He hoped he’d struck the note 
of casual interest. 

“It goes back. I run a chain 
of geriatoria and I came to 
know this senior citizen, 
Jackie. Quite senile, childishly 
disobedient, but everyone’s 
favorite.” 

Ohmigaud. Rush hated to 
hear about old people. 

“He would cry out in a kind 
of rote fear, ‘Save my soul . 
save my soul . save my soul 
from the fires of hell.’ And 
sometimes, ‘Gabriel! Gabriel! 
Gabriel !’ ” Ken smiled. “I can 
see him trying to pick up 
noodles on his fork and get- 
ting angry. ‘Why do they cut 
it so short?’ ” Ken shook him- 
self. “Well, the last time I saw 
Jackie he wasn’t baby-pink 
but gray. Vitamins and dex- 
trose met in a Y of plastic 
tubing and trickled into his 



9 




veins. A thready pulse in the 
stringy arm. I was' glad he 
was going quietly into the 
long sleep, as we call it.” 

He coughed and hurried on 
as Rush shifted weight. 

‘‘His eyelids lifted; bleared 
whites showed, then thin cres- 
cents. He groaned. And I 
could see Jackie falling into 
the fires he feared.” Ken shiv- 
ered. “I found myself saying, 
‘It’s all right, Jackie. This is 
Gabriel. Your soul is safe 
from the fires of hell. I’m tak- 
ing you to God.’ ” 

Rush stared. “Did it work?” 
“I think so. I hope so. If it’d 
been not a voice in the ear but 
a vision within, I’d be sure. 
Since then I’ve worked out 
the way.” He went into jar- 
gon beyond Rush — even if 
Rush had listened. 

Rush was seeing visions 
and dreaming dreams. 

He grew aware of a ques- 
tioning silence. “Um-hum.” 
Rush had edged around and 
Ken was facing an autobar. 
Ken thought of standing them 
a container of cognac. 

Ken grew expansive as alco- 
hol expanded his capillaries. 
“Rush, this is a thing I’m 
burning to promote. Not for 
the money, though I s’pose it 
might come to quite a bit. 
Thanks — ” as his cup was re- 
filled. “But for the satisfac- 
tion.” His face shone with 
earnestness and sweat. 

Rush frowned, but not too 
heavily. “Fine, Kenny, but you 
have to think this through. 

10 



More than a mere matter of 
life and death — everything is 
that. This would let a human 
mind settle its accounts for all 
eternity.” 

, Ken brandished his cup. 
“Kind of talk I need. Man I 
need. What say, Rush?” He 
waggled a finger as Rush 
opened his mouth. “Don’t ex- 
pect you to make up your 
mind all at once. Have to 
think things through.” 

Rush strove to strike a bal- 
ance between indecent haste 
and insulting slowness. 

And so — Instant Obituaries 
Unlimited. 

While casting about for 
some sound sentiment worthy 
of the moment, Rush belched. 

II 

R USH had already given 
the printer the go-ahead, 
but thought it only fitting to 
let Ken see the prospectus. 

Ken frowned over the lay- 
out and copy. 

“Kenny, you have to realize 
people don’t buy preventives, 
they buy cures. We’re selling 
the ultimate cure.” 

Ken read on. 

A devilish Before leered at 
the prospect, asking: 

Are you fearful of old age 
and the wasting away of your 
powers? 

Are you bitter about having 
chosen the wrong career, the 
wrong mate? 

Do you foresee doom without 
being able to alter it? 

Do you desire without hope 

EDWARD WELLEN 




of attaining the thing you 
desire? 

Are you remorseful for hav- 
ing squandered your talents, 
missed opportunities, deprived 
or mistreated others? 

Do you feel rejected or 
wronged? 

Are you unprepared to meet 
your Maker? 

Here an angelic After, the 
letters IOU penned on its 
feathers, put the devilish Be- 
fore behind it and beckoned 
the prospect. It said: 

It isn’t too late! When you 
close the books on life the 
IOU way, your personalized 
obit guarantees you satisfac- 
tion in the long sleep. If the 
body requires touching up just 
to lie on view, how much more 
does the dimming mind need 
the light of reassurance to en- 
able it to pass on without fal- 
tering into eternal darkness! 

Your personalized obit re- 
assures you that you haven’t 
lived your life in vain, that 
you have realized your poten- 
tialities to the full, that you 
have gratified your dearest and 
most secret desires. Your per- 
sonalized obit justifies your 
misdeeds, remits your sins of 
omission and commission. Your 
personalized obit convinces you 
that you are entering Paradise, 
harvesting the fruits of Heav- 
en, standing before the Throne 
— receiving comfort in the 
Presence. 

Plot your lot in life easily, 
the amazing new IOU way. 
Simply speak into the scientifi- 
cally designed Inscraper. This 
highly sensitive mechanism, de- 
veloped by IOU’s brilliant re- 
search staff — 

Ken turned brilliant red 
and coughed. 

IOU 



— and exclusive with IOU, au- 
tomatically translates your 
word-pictures of your version 
of the Hereafter into magnetic 
characters, permanently regis- 
tering your personalized obit. 

In minutes, you are ready 
for eternity, come what may. 
You live out the rest of your 
life, carefree in the assurance 
that, when your Time comes, 
efficient IOU emergency serv- 
ice springs into immediate ac- 
tion, transmittng the tape of 
our personalized obit to your 
rain. The magnetic characters 
return electronic signals that 
evoke the original eidetic 
imagery. But now, thanks to 
the fact that the power to rea- 
son and resist is failing, the 
vividness and reality of your 
vision of the Hereafter has in- 
creased manifold! 

Be among the first to know 
beyond the shadow of a doubt 
that you will enter into ever- 
lasting bliss! Dial O and ask 
to speak to your IOU repre- 
sentative today 1 

“Well?” 

“I didn't know you'd make 
it quite that — ” 

“We have to make it strong! 
I did think twice about say- 
ing, back there, that one 
might even sit on the Throne ; 
I figured that would raise too 
much hell. But don't let the 
religious angle trouble you. 
God has all eternity to set 
things right.” 

“That's right.” 

“Meanwhile, we put the 
fear of God and/or the Devil 
into them. Damned few have 
the moral courage to face up 
to the consequences of their 
weaknesses without weasel- 
ing, whining, or wishful 

11 




thinking. That's where we 
come in.” 

“I guess you can go ahead.” 

“Fine.” 

“And when that’s done?” 

“We sit back and wait.” 

Ken sat on the edge of his 
chair and eyed the furnish- 
ings. They represented all his 
savings and mortgagings. But 
Rush had been sure front was 
more important than the 
equipment that made IOU 
feasible and that Ken had 
stuck together out of second- 
hand parts. 

Rush went out whistling.

“There will be a nominal 
charge for orchestrating . .” 
— IOU contract form. 

U MBRELLA hooked on his 
arm, Otto Trever neared 
the IOU building, gateway to 
a better world. 

He would live not in the 
past with its wilted hopes and 
smoldering regrets, not on the 
forever-crumbling edge of the 
present, but in a heavening 
future. 

He sidled off the autowalk. 
With the awkward agility of 
the non-j ostler he made his 
way to the entrance. He found 
himself nodding to the robot 
doorkeeper; then, though he 
knew this made as little sense, 
scowled at it. It was in the 
shape of an angel. It handed 
him a numbered card. 

Full of comings and goings, 

12 



but not at all like a terminal, 
the waiting room struck a bal- 
ance between solemnity and 
sprightliness. Murals showed 
lion and lamb in loving to- 
getherness. 

Otto Trever sat watching 
numbers light up. His eyes 
followed figures springing or 
creaking to their feet and 
vanishing down corridors. His 
number came up. He himself 
came up, force of response 
compensating for slight delay, 
and eyes followed him. 

He came to a door. He 
showed his card and the door 
admitted him. He stood won- 
dering what to do with hat, 
umbrella, and himself. A voice 
murmured and Trever found 
himself deep in a chair, pour- 
ing out his heart to an inter- 
com. He found himself agree- 
ing he needed orchestrating of 
lis obit. The voice ushered him 
into a recording room. 

The blank-faced technician 
was re-filling sound effects. 
Labels indicated ringing 
hoofs, creaking leather, clash- 
ing swords ; the preceding 
client had wanted to believe, 
when his time should come, he 
was dying in battle, in the 
flower, untimely pluck’d, of 
ancient knighthood. 

Trever nodded. That was a 
way to go. Still, wasn’t it saf- 
er to go in your sleep, not 
knowing you were going? No, 
the best way was awarely — 
with editing. 

But mavbe the manner of 
his own going ought to have 

EDWARD WEILEN 




a bit more thought. Maybe — 

The technician was glanc- 
ing up from ticker tape nota- 
tions the computer relayed 
from the consulting rooms. 

Too late to back out now. 
Trever postured eagerness. 

“Won’t take long, sir. I see 
this calls for just a girl’s 
voice.” The tech turned to his 
mixing knobs. 

Not just a girl’s voice. The 
voice of Hannah O’Dea. Trev- 
er glared at the IOU-lettered 
back. Hannah had a breath- 
taking voice electronic tones 
couldn’t hope to match. 

But he listened to scales of 
syllables and heard himself 
saying, “There! That’s it!” 
whenever sound chimed with 
memory. 

Then the tech was saying, 
“There, that’s it.” 

And it was so. Trever could 
close his eyes and see Han- 
nah ; he almost laughed to 
hear her lilt meaningless syl- 
lables. 

Joy switched to panic. The 
tech was going to leave him to 
himself — and to Hannah. 

“Say anything you want in- 
to this mike. Press this, it’ll 
come out in your voice. Press 
that, it’ll come out in the 
young lady’s. This is for the 
playback.” 

His finger over a button, 
Trever was alone, staring at 
the mike. He was afraid. For 
without that button there was 
no Hannah, not for him. Han- 
nah had never given him 
steady encouragement. Still it 



was a shock when she laughed 
in his face. His face burned. 
His finger stabbed down. 

This time, Hannah was 
charmingly confused. The 
honor Otto was conferring 
overwhelmed her, unworthy 
being that she felt herself to 
be. She could only murmur, 
“Oh, darling, darling!” How 
tenderly masterful Trever 
was, whispering comfort with 
counterpoint of passion. 

He gazed around, part of 
himself lingering in that 
event. He pulled himself to- 
gether. Why, he hadn’t done 
badly. 

At that sweet seizure, he 
switched on the playback. He 
sat listening to a transvestite 
act. 

He’d pressed the buttons in 
the wrong order. 

All to do over again. 

R USH entered Ken’s office 
whistling the IOU theme. 
Without turning from the 
bank of closed-circuit screens, 
Ken put up a palm. Rush 
smiled, but silenced. He lis- 
tened a moment then moved 
to the window. He viewed the 
streaming in and out. He 
heard a sigh and a switching 
off, then Ken was at his side. 

Rush gestured. “And we’re 
just beginning.” 

“But it’s never-ending. 
We’ll never ease all the pain 
and sorrow.” 

“Don’t worry, Ken. Iron 
and bamboo curtains won’t 
stop us. I promise you.”

Ken put a hand on Rush’s 
shoulder. 

Their eyes lifted to the sun- 
set the weather bureau was 
projecting. 

Ken smiled. “What a life, 
when even loveliness brings 
sadness for its evanescence.” 

Loveliness. Rush remem- 
bered Margaret and felt for 
the clasp he had bought. No 
special occasion; just that he 
enjoyed drawing down big 
money and spending it. 

He looked down on the 
streaming in and out and 
whistled the IOU theme.

“Persons tvishing to spend 
eternity together may under 
clause ( iv ) open a joint check- 
ing-out account.” — IOU con- 
tract form. 

Q UICK as they laid Pat 
Conover in his grave his 
widow Norah began to fail. 
There was nothing mournful 
about her pining away. She 
was merely in a hurry to 
share Pat’s repose. 

Declining to look after her 
wellbeing, she quickened the 
process long invalidism had 
begun. Bedridden, she had en- 
trusted Pat with taping the 
one obit for the two of them. 

As this was a joint account 
the computer hadn’t erased 
the tape but stored it against 
further falling due. With effi- 
ciency the IOU man adminis- 
tered last-aid.

Norah’s face began to com- 
pose — then jolted to horror, 
disbelief, rage. With a gal- 
vanic lazarising, she sat up as 
you’d crook a finger and 
glared at the ghost-white IOU 
man. 

Ken burst into Rush’s office 
waving a. teleprint. “They 
served me by visiphone!” 
Rush had to admire his own 
calm. “Mrs. Conover?” 

Ken nodded. 

“She has no case. Where’s 
the harm in shock, when it’s 
shock that revived her?” 

“She wanted to die! But 
that misses the point. She’s 
suing not on her own behalf 
but for her husband’s estate.” 
“Same thing.” 

“She claims he got the 
wrong obit and should collect 
damages.” 

“What damages? He died 
happy.” 

“How do we know that?” 
Sometimes Rush felt like 
shaking Ken. “Prima-facie ev- 
idence. Smile of the beatific.” 
“Or grimace of pain,” said 
Ken. 

“Or gas. Sure. Why are you 
trying to undermine your- 
self?” 

“Might be kinder to allow 
we goofed. Ease the poor 
woman’s mind.” 

“Want our other clients to 
lose, through apprehension, 
the full effect of their obit?” 
“No-o.” 

“Wouldn’t surprise me, 
Kenny, if the ‘poor woman’ is 
a zealot-sympathizer trying to 

EDWARD WELLEN 




discredit our whole opera- 
tion.” 

N ORAH CONOVER told 
the arbitrator that even 
in her distress she didn’t feel 
IOU had done it deliberately. 
If IOU would own up to its 
mistake she’d be of a mind to 
forgive. 

She waved her cane. That 
obscene obit was none of Pat’s 
doing. “All those lascivious 
dancing-girls! All that drink- 
ing and carousing! Oh no, that 
wasn’t the heaven my Pat 
planned for us. I lived with 
the man forty years and I 
know Pat Conover never made 
that obit.” 

The arbitrator turned. “Mr. 
Tumulty?” 

Rush handed in data strips. 
“Here’s proof that Pat Cono- 
ver made and paid for the obit 
in question.” 

The cane flailed. “Some 
other Pat Conover!” 

“Sorry, madam, but accord- 
ing to our computer it has 
serviced no other Pat Cono- 
ver.” 

“Then your computer is 
loony !” 

The arbitrator said, “I un- 
derstand your agitation, Mrs. 
Conover, but let’s not get per- 
sonal.” 

Rush was handing in more 
data strips. “Service records 
prove our computer in perfect 
operating condition since acti- 
vation.” 

Norah tightened her lips as 
the arbitrator took in the 



data. Rush studied the ceiling. 

The arbitrator said, “Unless 
you can show me some proof, 
Mrs. Conover, I’m afraid — ” 

Norah broke down. The 
cane clattered. 

The arbitrator printed up 
its decision. It wondered why 
a breakdown always embar- 
rassed not the one breaking 
down but those looking on. 

(When Ken ran off the 
transcript of the proceedings, 
he felt that embarrassment. 
But Rush was right. They had 
scaled the heights of a higher 
justice. .) 

Otto Trever neared the IOU 
building. Knowing IOU to be 
infallible, he disregarded the 
catcalling of the zealot pickets. 

“Better unbought unhappi- 
ness than bought, unearned 
pleasure !” 

“You have chased after 
sin !” 

“Say farewell to your im- 
mortal soul!” 

On second thought, it would 
be better to begin with an 
aloof Hannah O’Dea. The tri- 
umph would be greater when 
she wound up a passionate 
slave. 

Unaware his dreamy smile 
was maddening. Trever 
passed through traffic admin- 
istrators holding back the 
zealots.

T HE weather bureau was 
projecting an outsize moon. 
It was the least the govern- 
ment could do now the Rus- 
sians had made the real moon 
constant, stationing it over 
Moscow. But it added to the 
hazards George Cavendish 
had to overcome. 

It forced him to make for 
the wall furthest from the 
beam, to keep from silhouet- 
ting himself. The main gate 
was in that wall, and so was 
the heaviest guard. 

The vane lofting him 
whirred softly, loud to his 
ears. He cupped an eye to the 
glow of his watch. 1924 hours. 
Good job of timing. Now. 

He sucked in air and pre- 
pared to cant himself into the 
yard. There was a stir in the 
tower emplacement and his 
guts writhed. 

But the discs that were the 
faces of the guards had 
phased toward the insubstan- 
tial moon. It was blinking. 

Cavendish guessed IOU had 
tapped the projector’s power 
line and was oscillating the 
juice. Rush Tumulty had 
promised a diversion at the 
right instant and was deliver- 
ing. Even in the dark, Cav- 
endish smiled inwardly ; no 
flashing of teeth to betray 
him. 

He landed, slipped into a 
workshop, and stashed the 
vane and a guard’s uniform. 
His spray injector he stowed 
under the jacket of the 
trusty’s uniform he wore. He 

16 



hid oehind a mountain of li- 
cense plates and sat waiting. 

He shivered. It was the 
chill of the raw hours. He 
wondered if Mort Greene saw 
the blinking from his cell in 
death row. 

Mort had robbed and killed 
to get the credits to buy his 
obit. Then the law caught up 
with him and fixed the day to 
die. The IOU computer regis- 
tered this bit of information 
and prepared to make good. 
But the law held Mort couldn’t 
benefit by his crimes, or what 
good would capital punish- 
ment be as a deterrent? It 
denied obit. 

IOU and its subscribers 
held that society might have 
the right to deprive the body 
of life, but not to deprive the 
mind of comfort — however 
paid for. The law and the zeal- 
ots held that body and mind 
were one and that one suit of 
punishment had to fit the 
whole crime. 

Cavendish didn’t feel deeply 
about it pro or con. But he 
felt deeply about making good. 
Rush Tumulty had sent him 
off with a firm handshake and 
a frank smile and something 
about IOU having a moral 
duty to test the case, to defy 
the law, to deliver the goods. 
It would be criminally foolish 
to pass up the chance to make 
this manifest to those who 
had joined up, and to those 
hesitating. Cavendish won- 
dered if Ken Wishart had the 
Chief’s sense of obligation. 

EDWARD WELLEN 




Wishart kept himself too 
much to himself. 

C AVENDISH wished the 
Chief had told him just 
who the inside contact would 
be. But the Chief was right. 
Suppose the law were to in- 
tercept Cavendish — and drag 
the name of the inside man 
out of him? It would stop dead 
all further attempts to reach 
Mort Greene in time. Still, 
he couldn’t help wondering. 
The warden? An arresting 
thought, but Cavendish shook 
his head; better suspend judg- 
ment, not commit the folly of 
committing oneself before- 
hand. He’d have to keep mind 
open and body alert if he were 
to acquit himself well. 

He must’ve dropped off, no 
blinking the fact. The world 
was cold gray. Inmates were 
marching to breakfast. 

Soon, many of them, with 
their guards, would be troop- 
ing into the shops, including 
the one where he sat hiding. 

He was to slip out and min- 
gle with the cons when they 
took their break in the yard. 
He was to stay inconspicuous ; 
the contact would know him 
by the number — 10010101 — 
on his jacket. The contact 
would take it from there. 

Cavendish sweated out close 
shaves. It was hard to hear 
footsteps in the din and he 
jumped in his skin whenever 
a voice sounded near. But his 
luck held. 

And it was time to knock 



off work, and sudden silence 
fell . save for the eerie lip- 
less talking of the cons and 
the silencing shouts of the 
guards. Cavendish slipped out 
and made himself part of the 
milling. 

He thought he was being 
inconspicuous but he found 
cons eyeing him and comment- 
ing coarsely. He remembered 
he’d sat all night on a stack 
of license plates; he must’ve 
impressed a number on his 
seat. He kept his back straight 
and bent his knees as he 
strolled, hoping his jacket 
would cover. But he attracted 
the gaze of a tower guard, 
hardlooking. 

The guard winked. His 
heart thumped his ribcage. 
The inside contact. He re- 
turned the wink. The guard 
turned away — swung back, 
and winked. Cavendish shot 
glances around, then winked. 
He knew he ought to move on 
before others noted. But the 
guard’s gaze held him. The 
guard winked. Cavendish 
groaned — hadn’t there been 
office enough? — but he winked. 

The guard raised his gun 
and blazed away at Cavendish. 

C AVENDISH came to in 
the prison hospital. He 
had only flesh wounds ; he sup- 
posed he should feel grateful. 
But there are soul wounds. 

Knowing it useless, he felt 
for the spray injector. Gone. 
They couldn’t have missed it 
when they stripped him to 



1 OU 



17 




tend his wounds of the flesh. 

He’d done his best, but he 
defended himself without con- 
viction. It was painful even to 
wonder what went wrong. 
Maybe the guard was a zealot, 
laughing to himself at the 
thought of crossing up the 
IOU agent. 

A figure leaned over him. 
A trusty-orderly. The man 
would have the freedom of the 
place. If he jumped the man; 
got his naked flesh into those 
clothes, he’d have a fighting 
chance. 

He caught the man in a 
hammerlock. 

The man broke it and 
pushed him down. “Mercy me, 
10010101, you are screwy. 
You’re lucky to be living. 
Zwicker’s touchy about his tic. 
Why*d you have to make fun 
of it? Lucky I got to you first 
and glommed the injector. 
They figure Zwicker went stir 
crazy.” 

Cavendish found his voice. 
“Will the spray injector get 
to Greene in time?” 

The con nodded. “Sure.” 
Then frowned. “Need his 
key?” 

“No. The computer will 
send the obit at execution 
time. They’re not moving it 
up?” 

The con shook his head. 
"Not that it would be any 
trouble to get Greene’s key. 
It’s in the warden’s safe.” 

“You mean he’s in this with 
us?” 

“Mercy no. Account of all 



the pete men in here, the war- 
den don’t bother locking it. 
Now we have to think how to 
get you out.” 

Cavendish told him of the 
cache. 

The trusty had hardly left 
when Cavendish remembered 
the vane. His heart thumped. 
Would the con take off, leav- 
ing Cavendish to face the rap? 

Cavendish waited. When he 
heard footsteps he feared to 
turn. 

It was the trusty. Empty- 
handed. 

The trusty unwound a 
guard’s uniform, cummer- 
bunded under his jacket. Cav- 
endish dressed with haste. 

He tried to think guard as 
the con escorted him past eyes 
to the dark workshop. 

Vane strapped on and whir- 
ring, Cavendish asked, “Why 
didn’t you take this and 
escape?” 

“Mercy. You happen to set 
your eyes on all the license 
plates ? More each year. Think 
I’d throw away the break of 
being safe from vane traffic?” 

Time to go. All eyes, includ- 
ing those of the trusty, who 
failed to see him wave, were 
on a shadow-stained window. 
As he went over the wall he 
thought he saw lights dim. 

B OTH Mort Greene and the 
trusty-barber seemed em- 
barrassed that the hairshav- 
ing was a superfluous gesture. 
But under cover of it the bar- 
ber used the injector the 



18 



EDWARD WELLEN 




orderly had slipped him to 
shoot the transistorized parti- 
cles into Mort Greene’s brain. 

Mort did not hear the hiss- 
ing of the electric charge. He 
heard ringing hoofs, creaking 
leather, clashing swords. 

Cavendish smoothed down 
his hair; knowing the Chief’s 
flair for publicity, he felt it 
likely he’d be walking into a 
telepress conference. He 
entered the Chief’s office, 
steeling himself against glare 
and noise. 

Rush was alone. He sprang 
up and clapped Cavendish on 
the back. “Wonderful work, 
George. Too bad we can’t pub- 
licize it. But I’ve been kicking 
it around. If people learned 
Greene got away with it, 
wouldn’t it tempt many to 
emulate him? No, the well- 
being of Society comes fore- 
most. It’s only good business 
ethics. We have to refund 
stolen money, so it would be 
not only without honor but 
without profit.’’ 

Cavendish knew letdown as 
Rush saw him out. Then hand- 
shake and smile made it all 
right. 

Otto Trever took a card 
from the doorangel. He smiled 
at the robot and then, realiz- 
ing the folly of expending 
feeling on a machine, deep- 
ened smile. It felt good to 
know he was dealing with a 
law-abiding concern. He 
didn't keep up with the news 
these days, but some pros and 
cons of the Mort Greene case 

1 OU 



had got through to him. 
Knowing IOU had restrained 
itself, shown itself on the side 
of law and order, he could dis- 
regard the Zealot pickets, 
who, though they had lost 
talking point, had not lost 
voice. 

He entered the IOU build- 
ing sure he had it now. 

Hannah O’Dea would be the 
mistress of that rogue Otto 
Trever. She was one of a suc- 
cession, and knew it. A pretty 
plaything but fast fading, she 
lived in dread of Otto's dis- 
carding her for a fresher play- 
thing.

“70 U agrees to serve as 
ante-mortem executor and will 
carry out the express wishes 
of the client .” — IOU contract 
form. 

T IME had thrown her fea- 
tures out of focus, but as 
Ken looked at her, a nudge of 
memory resolved the face into 
that of his onetime favorite 
star, Cara Lovelace. 

It was hard to believe this 
wasn’t another telecast with 
Cara Lovelace playing the 
lead. Ken viewed her with a 
protecting tenderness that 
forgave bad makeup, quaver- 
ing voice, wringing of bejew- 
eled hands. 

The first thing she looked 
for when she entered the con- 
sulting booth was a mirror. 
The shining surface of the 

19 




intercom, designed to induce 
a semi-hypnotic state in which 
inhibitions would lessen, 
served. She felt melancholy. 
Her reflection informed her 
she looked soulful. She bright- 
ened — then tried to recall that 
shade of melancholy. She 
wanted to recapture that soul- 
ful look. 

The intercom broke in soft- 
ly with its gentle probing. 

An audience ! Cara re- 
sponded. She spotlighted her 
rise in the theater, told of co- 
starring with Lane Pierce, 
then of going on to solo great- 
ness, spoke trippingly of her 
tours. 

Ken started at another 
memory. Lane Pierce had 
taped an obit only a few 
months before. Rush had 
noted it with special interest 
because someone not Lane 
Pierce had already taped an 
obit assuring himself he was 
the one and only Lane Pierce. 
The man could imagine no 
greater bliss than to die be- 
lieving he had been that nova 
of Casanovas. 

“Now,” Cara said with a 
dramatic sigh, “I’ve reached 
a point in the road where I 
can see where I am and what 
I have and can expect.” The 
mirroring surface gave back 
soulfully. “And I ask myself, 
‘Was it all for this?’ ” 

Keii saw she couldn’t be- 
lieve that. She clung to youth, 
squeezed into it; shoes and 
girdle extruded Cara. 

“Not that I think it’s all 



over, or that it hasn’t been 
worth while. But there’s one 
thing I want to take care of 
at the curtain.” 

She stopped. Ken, feeling 
this was not a dramatic device 
but a pause before a plunge, 
willed her not to tape the sort 
of obit Lane Pierce had taped. 
Stiff hands unpursed a letter, 
still sealed. 

It would show blank when 
you held it to light; static 
electricity when you stripped 
off the flap brought out the 
writing. The letter was old, 
but there was only the start 
of a tear. 

Ken strained to hear. 

"This goes back to when I 
and Lane appeared together.” 

Together not only onscreen 
but off. But her best friend, 
Ada Moffat, had fun teasing 
her. “You’re not dating 
him?!” He stuttered offscreen. 
Ada mocked. “ ‘It seems a 
cocoon’s age since I saw you 
last night!’ ” 

Cara was mad about his 
deep voice bespeaking depths 
of meaning, his deep eyes 
depths of feeling. But Ada 
would whisper, “ ‘What a 
lovely Jejune moon; it makes 
me crave the baboon of a 
kiss !’ ” Ada was competent 
enough actress to capture 
Lane. Cara would blush and 
go cold. Ada said Lane was a 
bore and groaned amusingly 
at sight of him. Cara tried to 
fight misgivings. But she saw 
le«s and less of Lane. And of 
Ada. 



20 



EDWARD WELLEN 




O N the eve of the wedding 
of Lane Pierce and Ada 
Moffat, Cara received the let- 
ter. Her first impulse was to 
tear it to bits; her next, to 
tear it open. 

Why was Lane writing now 
— unless to confess he re- 
gretted having decided to 
marry Ada? He repented be- 
fore it was too late ; Cara was 
his love; he and Cara — if she 
still cared for him — would 
elope. Cara started to rip the 
flap. Latent writing showed 
faint. 

She stopped. Suppose Lane 
hoped she wouldn’t judge him 
harshly; suppose, singing 
praises of Ada, he asked Cara 
to wish them well. 

Latent writing remained 
too faint to make out. Fearing 
the finality of knowing, she 
shut the letter away. At long 
intervals she took the station- 
ery from its resting place and 
with half-averted eyes tried 
to make out the writing. 
Sometimes it seemed to spell 
out one big “Yes,” sometimes 
“No.” 

Now it was up to IOU to do 
for her what she lacked the 
will to do herself. She touched 
her neck. She was leaving the 
letter for the computer to open 
and scan and record. What- 
ever the message, it would be 
her obit. 

IOU assured her it would 
carry out her orders to the 
letter. Having deposited that 
letter in the scan slot, she 
rose, performed a bow, and, 



uptilting her chin, exited. 

Now the booth was void of 
both dead letter and living 
spirit, and still. And yet it 
held Ken’s gaze and thought. 
Sometimes life seemed like 
a dress rehearsal. Opening 
night was upcoming, but not 
yet. In moments like this, he 
felt he and the world of his 
senses were not really on. 

Another client entered the 
booth and broke the spell. 
Ken switched off, then real- 
ized the client had been Otto 
Trever. Ken smiled, left the 
switch off, and returned to 
his work. 

But he found himself re- 
turning to Cara Lovelace. 
And Lane Pierce. How the 
deduce could you figure a guy 
like that? In Pierce’s obit 
there was no dialogue, no re- 
citing of his triumphs on- 
screen and off, no word- 
picture of heavenly scenery. 
Only the thunder of canned 
applause. 

Lane Pierce and his vac- 
uum-packed obit; Cara Love- 
lace and her sealed letter ; the 
man identifying himself with 
the outer Lane Pierce — which 
had the best of it? Ken turned 
back with a sigh, for he didn’t 
know what, to the l’s and 0’s 
of the IOU computer’s current 
report. 

O TTO TREVER sat down 
in the booth, still a bit 
out of breath. He had laid 
about him tellingly with his 
umbrella. 



IOU 



21 




If the hassle had started 
when he was leaving, obit in 
order, he might’ve resigned 
himself to being struck down, 
maybe even welcomed dying. 
But he would let nothing stop 
him before he could revise his 
obit. 

What made it hard on his 
umbrella was that the Zealots 
picked him as prime target. 
By now, they probably took 
him for a staff member of 
IOU. But that was behind him 
and he put it out of his mind. 

The living Hannah O’Dea 
had gone away with her lover. 
Trever had never heard from 
Hannah. Whatever he heard 
was of her happiness ; it only 
added to his unhappiness. The 
new obit would alter that. 

He would encounter an old, 
life-beaten Hannah. She would 
turn away. Then, seeing no 
way of averting the meeting, 
she would face him. “If I had 
it to do all over again — Oh, 
Otto, if I only had it to do 
over again!” 

VII 

G riffin manning’s 

chest tightened. He sat 
eyeing the intercom much as 
the astrogastor of the first 
starship sat at her controls. 
In his own mind the compari- 
son was more down to earth; 
he was a moron aspiring to 
migraine. Not that heaven 
was a headache. The headache 
was trying to conceive a hea- 
ven. 

22 



“I simply lack imagina- 
tion.” 

The intercom consoled him. 

The recording tech was 
waiting with a suitable range 
of prepackaged heavens. 
“Whenever you hear one you 
like, sir, press this. Later, 
you’ll make your final selec- 
tion.” 

Out of sight in the control 
room the tech rolled the tape 
and listened in, yawning. 
After three solid hours of 
ethereality the tech saw Man- 
ning was hard to please. 

Not one abode of bliss — 
not Sumeru or T’ien or Swar- 
ga or Aaru or Gan Eden or 
Olam ha-Ba or Elysium or 
Ching-tu or Jodo or Gokuraku 
or Asgard or Flatheanas or 
Albordy or Tuma of the Val- 
ley of the Assassins or Mict- 
lan or Xibalba or Sibao or 
Tegri or Shipapu or Ponemah 
or Ilahee or Tir na n-Og or Hy 
Brasil or Avalon or Sukhavati 
or Langi or Untola or Dilum 
or Bolotoo or Hesunanin or 
Xanadu — had moved Man- 
ning’s finger. 

Moslems were threatening 
to enjoin IOU from allowing 
infidels to enjoy Jennet ’Adn. 
Turning his gaze toward the 
Throne of the Compassionate, 
the tech slipped Jennet ’Adn 
in. 

No paradise. He quickly 
reprogrammed. But nothing 
drew response — not the sen- 
sation of immersion in amni- 
otic flued ; not Nirvana, where 
all desire is wanting; not a 

EDWARD WELLEN 




rice-wine dream; not opium 
pipe dreams or marijuana or 
mushroom hallucinations; not 
the esthetic paradise of Dan- 
te’s allegory. The tech tight- 
ened his lips and tapped 
Mahler’s symphonic heaven. 
Still no response. The tech 
smiled. He hadn’t played his 
trump. 

T HE First Star Expedition 
had been sending back 
reports. 

IOU was among the earliest 
to subscribe for bulletins of 
the Eschatological Survey 
Team of Starex One. So there 
was a great dipper of non- 
human heavens to draw on as 
well. 

That of the folk of Mekbuba 
II. In their heaven the chief- 
est delight was to go around 
scowling. It was joy to envis- 
age relaxing from the livelong 
need to smile, a smile being 
the most efficient arrangement 
of features for scooping in the 
tiny airborne organisms on 
which they fed. 

And that of the folk of 
Nashira II. They led a hard 
life and yearned for a harder 
time in heaven. In retrospect 
their temporal lot would seem 
not so bad after all. 

And that of those of Spica 
II, in whom the nose had 
grown vestigial. These people 
looked forward to a return to 
the dream days of legend ; the 
nose would quiver with sensa- 
tion and the heady effect of 
pollen, pollution, and putre- 

24 



faction would become known. 
Their desire was all the 
stronger because, honoring 
tradition, they preserved the 
conditions making these 
things tantalizingly omnipres- 
ent. 

And of Salm II, a teeming 
planet. Each person believed 
that on reaching heaven it 
would — whatever pleasure it 
queued up for — always be first 
in line. 

The heaven of Alkalurops 
II was special — its would-be 
dwellers having from the be- 
ginning reserved all good 
things for heaven — and the 
tech knew a fleeting urge to 
put this in place of his pres- 
ent obit. 

Heavens rolled by but Man- 
ning held out. 

Swallowing angry embar- 
rassment, the tech stood be- 
side Manning. Manning made 
no sign of awareness. Taking 
this for sign of displeasure, 
the tech with savage feelings 
but gentle touch prodded Man- 
ning. 

“Haven’t you been able to 
come to any conclusion, sir?’’ 

Manning nodded and slowly 
slid out of his chair. Some- 
where along the line he had 
died of — one had to suppose 
— ecstasy. 

R USH damned Ken under 
his breath. “Why’d you 
bust out to the press with a 
mea culpa? I could’ve hushed 
this Manning bit.’’ 

Ken lifted his head slowly. 

EDWARD WELIEN 




“Rush, I wonder if what we’re 
doing is good. The spirit is 
willing—” 

Rush stilled a quick retort. 
He steepled his fingers. “We 
do our human best. Besides, 
the guy got what he wanted.” 

Ken sat up. “You’re darn 
tootin’. I let the shock and the 
uproar throw me.” He eyed 
the monitors, not seeming to 
see how many screens were 
dark, how many consulting 
booths were not in use. “Be a 
shame to let all this go by de- 
fault . .” The unending spec- 
tacle caught him up. 

Rush left. He wished he 
could convince himself it 
would come out right. 

The Zealots had hold of this 
and were milking it. 

They had strong backing; 
more to the point, they had a 
head — Yardley Bourne. 

Bourne’s biting mouth in- 
terpreted all-seeing provi- 
dence, frightening away pros- 
pects. “This Manning-martyr- 
ing monster, IOU, usuros 
God’s function, shortcircuits 
Judgment, undermines Au- 
thority. This tool of the Devil 
encourages wicked living by 
‘forgiving’ all at the end of 
living.” Yardley Bourne 
wanted his finger in the pie in 
the sky. “By jiminy, I demand 
that all obits be open to in- 
spection !” 

Then there was Soul Secur- 
ity. So far, Soul Security 
limited itself to obiting pets. 
The most peevish Zealot 
couldn’t fault Soul Security 

IOU 



for taping the voice of the 
master or mistress praising 
the dying animal. Even Yard- 
ley Bourne couldn’t misinter- 
pret Soul Security’s taping, 
for dogs, the odor-complex of 
a congregational tree, with 
bonus cat at bay on a bough; 
for cats, a micey smell, or 
fluttering of bird or flopping 
of goldfish under paw; tensile 
infinity of worm, for birds. 

Rush told himself that when 
the newness wore off the pub- 
lic’s interest would turn back 
to IOU. But “Soul Security” 
seemed undue for a dumb- 
beast clientele. 

IOU was in no present dan- 
ger of collapsing, if that was 
what Soul Security hoped. 
IOU could keep going till obit 
storage charges ran out. 

Back to Manning. IOU’s 
pitch would be that Manning 
had got what he wanted. 

Oh. Tell the computer to 
collect in advance from now 
on. 

Margaret Tumulty let the 
curtain fall in place. The little 
band of Zealots was there yet. 
She had grown aware that 
they had stilled and she had 
hoped they were gone. At 
least they had stilled. Listen- 
ing to their yapping at IOU 
made her feel, well, sick. She 
tried to hide her feelings from 
Rush whenever she saw him 
but the idea of an obit gave 
her the shivers. But Zealots 
were disgusting, and just 
hearing them she felt disloyal. 
Still, it seemed to please Rush 

25 




that she hadn’t yielded to the 
pulling power of IOU com- 
mercials ; he took it as a trib- 
ute to their personal relation- 
ship — she contemplated no 
greater joy. 

She turned to her set and 
had it replay her favorite 
Neal McGillicuddy Cloy tele- 
cast. All was sweet, safe, and 
sure until a large band of 
Zealots, who like all Zealots 
took pride in being outspoken 
and in looking for opposition, 
came upon those outside the 
Tumulty mansion. These last 
had shouted themselves hoarse 
down-withing the Manning- 
martyrers and up-withing the 
Zealots. Their whispering 
caused the newcomers to take 
them for IOU conspirators 
and to wade into them blood- 
ily. Margaret raised the vol- 
ume. 

O TTO TREVER nodded ab- 
sent farewell to the door- 
angel. This was it, the obit to 
end all obits. But he felt re- 
gret for all he had to leave 
behind. Spatially the obit 
waiting in the necrofile lay 
behind; temporally it lay be- 
fore. Why in many-mansioned 
possibility must he fix on only 
one, possibly free, choice? 
Deaf and blind to the Zealots, 
Trever passed through them 
along a t.a.-held line, and 
stepped onto the autowalk 
heading home. 

The door-angel gazed after 
the vanishing figure. Some- 
thing was 0. 

26 



Most clients were one-time 
arrivals; there was no need 
for the door-angel to sort them 
out. Trever always wore the 
same clothing, always toted 
his umbrella — defiant symbol 
of the Radical Republicans, 
who once opposed functional- 
izing the weather bureau. The 
door-angel had come to recog- 
nize Trever and, torn between 
recognizing and the non-need 
to recognize, found salvation 
by stacking the deck to pre- 
sent Trever always with the 
same card. Now it gazed after 
the vanishing figure and real- 
ized what was 0. The man 
had forgotten to take his 
umbrella. 

The door-angel hurried in 
and retrieved the battle- 
scarred umbrella, but by then 
the man was rounding out of 
sight. 

The weather bureau had 
switched on a breeze. The 
door-angel’s wings trembled. 
The door-angel eyed the vanes 
in the traffic lanes above and 
beyond the autowalks. It 
spread its wings and moved 
them. 

Its makers had not designed 
the wings for such levity, but 
the door-angel rose. It was 
flying. 

It looked for the man but 
the earth was tipping over. 
Its wings were tearing off. 
The ground came up. 

The umbrella. Somewhere 
in the door-angel’s recondi- 
tioned metal was the memory 
image of parachute and nose 

EDWARD WELLEN 




cone. The door-angel tore at 
the catch. 

It was immovable; being 
only a symbol, the umbrella 
didn’t open. The door-angel 
perished without benefit of 
obit. 

VIII 

“/» as much as personal 
identity is immaterial to obit- 
administering , the client may 
elect to use a pseudonym .” — 
10 U contract form. 

R USH looked down. He 
could tell the t.a.s by their 
blue uniforms, the Zealots by 
the lightning-emblazoned arm- 
bands they had taken to wear- 
ing, and the obit-seekers by 
their fewness. 

He turned from the window 
to spottily-lit monitors. An 
outthrusting jaw, bulb nose, 
and wild eyebrows caught his 
eyes. He smiled. The whole 
getup screamed disguise. 
These days clients seemed to 
want to hide from family, 
friends, and foes that they 
were clients. For Rush’s bene- 
fit, the computer printed on 
the screen the name G. F. 
VEHR (PSEUD.). 

The electronic frisking had 
given him a bad moment; he 
had feared the t.a.s would 
penetrate his careful disguise. 
But they had not even sus- 
pected disguise. They were 
simply on the lookout for 
Zealot sabotage. It had all 
worked out for the best. He 



was here now, and the ordeal 
had shaken loose his last res* 
ervations. 

It was the fuss about Man- 
ning that made him think of 
taping his own obit. Not that 
he wanted to die in ecstasy — 
not just yet. He had so much 
more good to do on earth. But 
taping a trial obit might be 
the answer to what was 
troubling him. 

It began when Manager 
Forbes — he advised the inter- 
com all names were purely 
fictitious — singled out young 
Vehr. Vehr’s unclouded vision 
of the shining purity of the 
Ideal — neat, evenly-balanced 
books, ditto towns, ditto peo- 
ple — exalted him above the 
classmates in the business 
ethics seminary. Colonizing of 
Venus was beginning. 

“The first Carrier of the 
Word on Venus! A great hon- 
or, my son, but one you richly 
deserve.’’ 

“I am not worthy, Manager 
Forbes.” 

“Oh, you are, my son.” 

Then the briefing. The veil 
of Venus fell. Vehr closed his 
eyes. No shining purity there. 
No neat, evenly-balanced 
books, towns, people. Violence, 
lust, passion ran amuck in the 
raw settlements. 

He packed. Manager Forbes 
arranged passage. But Venus 
had evidently got word of im- 
pending salvation ; anonymous 
abuse in dirty English, Chi- 
nese and Russian flooded the 
seminary. Manager Forbes in 

27 



1 OU 




particular came in for brutal 
cautioning, vilifying and ridi- 
culing. 

Manager Forbes vetoed the 
mission. Venus was not yet 
worthy of such as Vehr. The 
seminary would turn its face 
toward a more deserving flock 
nearer home. 

Vehr protested. But he 
bowed to greater wisdom, not 
without a spurt of fear. He 
had come near to overdoing 
his disappointment, moving 
more than one director to talk 
of overriding the veto and giv- 
ing the lad his chance to 
prove himself. 

“Poor Manager Forbes. But 
it was all for the best. By 
sending those letters I was 
able to keep shining and pure 
my vision of the Ideal.” Mind 
had triumphed over matter, 
yet he found himself thinking 
often of the aborted mission 
and the thought always car- 
ried a feeling of apprehension. 
Worsening of late, it took the 
form of a fear of saying or 
doing something embarrass- 
ing. He was a public figure. 
He couldn’t restrict himself to 
pretaped appearances. 

Taping an obit allaying a 
disagreeable memory in the 
hereafter might, bv taking off 
pressure, allay a disagreeable 
memory in the here. In his 
obit he would be leaving a 
World in which Man had never 
torn the veil from Venus, a 
Venus innocent as the dawn 
of Earth when mystery 
brooded over the waters. 



It seemed to work. The out- 
thrusting jaw, bulb nose and 
wild eyebrows couldn’t ex- 
press the joy of one shut of 
burdensome memory, but 
Rush sensed just that when 
Vehr got up to go. Rush 
started to switch off, then 
stopped. The very positiveness 
of the false features suggested 
their negatives. Rush knew he 
ought to know the underlying 
face. Vehr was moving out of 
the frame when it came to 
Rush. 

Neal McGillicuddy Cloy. 

C LOY was following arrows 
blinking This Way Out. 
Rush took his elbow. 
“There’s another way, Mr. 
Vehr.” He looked around. 
"Private. The staff comes and 
goes without having to pass 
through the Zealots waiting 
out there. Allow me.” 

“Why, thank you. Most 
kind. Much for the best.” 
Rush hurried Cloy past 
Ken’s office and into his own. 
Cloy’s eyes darted around be- 
hind eyebrows. Rush intro- 
duced himself and showed 
Cloy a chair. 

“While you’re here, Mr. 
Vehr, suppose I show you how 
we do our job.” 

Cloy remained standing. 
“Interesting, I’m sure, Mr. 
Tumulty. But I’m afraid I 
haven’t the time — ” 

Rush was tuning in a moni- 
tor.

nah and I were shipwrecked

alone together on an aster- 
oid we . 

The prelapsaurian jaw fell. 
“Am I hearing and seeing 
right? Do you eavesdrop on 
your clients?” 

“Monitor. I won’t pay cloy 
— I mean play coy. We moni- 
tor to make sure all goes 
smoothly.” 

Cloy sat down and viewed 
the monitor till it went black. 

“Quite moving. I see you 
are doing a splendid job. In- 
deed, I venture to wonder if 
I might buy into IOU? On a 
modest scale, of course.” 

“Your confidence is touch- 
ing, Mr. Vehr. But frankly, 
owing to certain disrupting 
influences our position isn’t 
ideal. We need the moderat- 
ing presence of a man of stat- 
ure devoted to our interests 
and believing in our princi- 
ples.” 

“Loyalty, as we in business 
ethics put it, is the dividend 
on a mutually advantageous 
agreement.” 

“I share that sentiment.” 

“This has been very pleas- 
ant, Mr. Tumulty. Now if 
you’ll kindly show me your 
easy way out — ” 

O N his way out Otto Tre- 
ver, mended umbrella on 
his arm, was in two minds as 
he glanced at the door-angel. 
It was partly the same door- 
angel, partly not. “Cainabel- 
izing,” he thought of calling 
it. In any case, even if it 
were the same It, there was 
no sense thanking it for at- 



tempting to restore the um- 
brella to him — or blaming it 
for damaging the precious 
symbol. It had only been try- 
ing to do its duty. 

More disturbing was the 
breaking of his lucky streak. 
The card he had received on 
entering had not been the 
usual one. Omen? Meaning- 
less hangover of superstition. 
But already his pleasure in 
the latest revision was fad- 
ing .. 

Margaret Tumulty lit up 
knowing Neal McGillicuddy 
Cloy was appearing live. Just 
knowing made it more real, 
made him seem his sanguin- 
est. The very polyanthus in 
his lapel seemed to nod agree- 
ment as he spoke and to rest 
assured as he stopped for 
breath. 

“Don’t we unconsciously 
pretty up the past with the 
powder puff of forgetfulness? 
Of course we do. Don’t we un- 
consciously jolly up the fu- 
ture with rouge of expecta- 
tion? Of course we do. Don’t 
we rationalize? Of course we 
do. The good old human na- 
ture in us, my friends, makes 
us do these things. Then why 
not be practical and do these 
things honestly and forth- 
rightly, by a conscious exer- 
cise of the will?” 

The polyanthus considered, 
already swayed. 

“I see no harm and much 
good in such works as IOU is 
carrying out. We owe a debt 
of gratitude to IOU for help- 
ing us balance our accounts. 

29 



1 OU 




Those who doubt, those who 
say otherwise, are foolishly 
crape-hanging. And as you 
know — ” 

The polyanthus nodded yes.

“10 U will not censor or 
otherwise seek to control the 
content of your personalized 
obit.” — IOU contract form. 

W ATCHING the monitors, 
Ken sat hunched like an 
embryonic premonition. To 
Rush he seemed to be bearing 
the whole burden of original 
virtue. 

Ken turned. “Rush, what 
do you really believe? Is there 
a rising up again? A here- 
after?” 

Rush frowned. What pro- 
fiteth a man to think thus? 
He smiled. IOU and its rami- 
fications had grown out of 
Ken’s worrying about his own 
soul. “If you have to think 
about it, it’s best to be hard- 
boiled as an Easter Egg about 
the concept.” 

Ken sighed. “All the more 
reason to do our best. You 
agree?” 

Rush, his mind casting a 
cold eye of economic justifi- 
cation on the Vehr account^ 
listed under miscellaneous ex- 
penses, said, “What? Oh, I 
agree. That’s business ethics. 
We all have to do our best.” 
Cloy’s pitch was paying off, 
but not as much as Rush had 
hoped. The Zealots, with 



seemingly unending backing, 
were still noisily intimidating. 
Rush viewed the waiting 
room. To make it seem fuller 
he’d set up a lag in the com- 
puter’s dispatching of clients. 
But it was embarrassing; the 
computer knew its capacities 
and would fidget at the clog- 
ging waste of time. 

W HITNEY INSKIP, small 
features huddling in big 
face, waited. 

He didn’t mind waiting, did 
he? 

No, he didn’t mind. 

He had waited so long in 
his life waiting had become 
habit. Not not minding so 
much as believing he couldn’t 
help enduring. He waited. 

With the suddenness of at 
last, the waiting ended. 

He found it hard to talk 
about himself. He couldn’t re- 
member ever laughing or cry- 
ing with full lungpower. He 
must have as a child, but re- 
straint had set in early. May- 
be once he had thought he 
could care for the work he did. 
He bent over dials with silent 
intentness but seemed no long- 
er to be doing work he could 
care for. The company of his 
few friends roused no full- 
throated laughter, no whole- 
hearted gusto. 

But he had his dream. 

You didn’t, even to your 
best friends, tell all your 
dream. He had learned that. 
Continual rebuffing should 
have thickened his skin. It 



30 



EDWARD WELLEN 




had only reinforced his si- 
lence. Quietly he saved up. 

One day he hired a one-man 
spaceboat. In the speckling 
between Mars and Jupiter he 
picked out an asteroid and 
landed. It was no use. He 
could be sure there was no 
other human in a hundred 
thousand miles, but there 
wasn’t air enough to waft a 
whisper. 

He headed for Mars, landed 
on the Gorki Desert, climbed 
out. It was no use. There was 
air enough, though thin, but 
just under the horizon might 
be someone. He climbed in. He 
took off. 

He let the spaceboat drift 
sunward. But his dream was 
strong. He switched on the 
reverse rockets. But where, 
where? He remembered the 
air bubbles. 

Mile-diameter plastic bub- 
bles, bottle-green, spotted 
strategically about, they held 
high oxygen-content air. 
Spaceship air might sour due 
to sick algae, leak out owing 
to a hole in the hull or carbon- 
ize because of recycling break- 
down. It was a misdemeanor 
to make non-emergency use 
of a bubble. Inskip made junc- 
ture with the nearest, never- 
theless. 

Carrying a half-mile of ny- 
lon cord out of ship’s stores, 
he threaded his wav through 
a stand of fittings. They were 
all too small. Then he swotted 
a large valve, a mere circle — 
or flap, since it fused at one 

1 OU 



point with the bubble proper 
— of the same stuff. It gave 
windily. He squeezed through, 
tied one end of the coil to the 
flap where it hinged, then let 
the flap in place, sealing the 
opening. 

He was inside, feeling bub- 
bling in himself, in his blood. 
Soon, soon! 

He got out of his spacesuit 
and used the belt to moor it. 
He held the free end of the 
cord and kicked himself off. A 
bit of entangling shortened 
the cord, but in substance he 
was floating at the center. 

The air was warm and he 
relaxed. Then he panicked. 

If he lost his grip and drift- 
ed he would die floating in the 
center of the bubble. He tied 
the cord to his middle. He 
breathed easier. 

All the air he needed. No 
one in sight. This was it. He 
began to breathe consciously, 
the oxygen exalting him. He 
breathed deeply and rapidly 
for a minute, then could hold 
his breath much longer than 
normally. Now. He sucked in 
the breath. 

It was no use. Something — 
if only the indifferent uni- 
verse — was eyeing him. It de- 
flated him. 

“Now I’m here.” 

Once, just once, he ached to 
let out in one cry — what? He 
didn’t know. He had come 
close to knowing. He had 
failed. His dream was still a 
dream. He eyed the intercom. 
Maybe . 



31 




6WTF that’s all the heaven he 

-l can dream up, maybe we 
ought to interpolate some- 
thing beautific.” 

“No, Ken. We can’t say a 
man’s heaven isn’t his own to 
make.’’ Hell, no; just let the 
Zealots learn IOU was alter- 
ing obits ! But it was all right ; 
Ken was nodding slowly. Be- 
sides, another monitor was 
catching Ken’s attention. 

Theodora Molyneux (pseud.) 
wore a veil whose shim- 
mering chromium - phosphor 
thread said voice-disguise. 
Her breath played on the fine 
taut strands, and Rush and 
Ken and the computer heard 
tones with harmonics of a 
mingled, distant sweetness. 

The veil did its equivocal 
job well. Rush tried to pierce 
it. IOU was a fine place to 
winkle out peris. Women cli- 
ents had proved an exotic 
source of sex: open to reason 
because open to emotion; 
amenable because tof obit 
cleared conscience ; pliable be- 
cause he could pick them with 
care, plan accidental meeting, 
and play on longings they be- 
trayed unsuspectingly, as 
now. Something about this 
one disturbed Rush. 

“He always forgets to men- 
tion changes in his plans till 
the last minute. Never enters 
his mind I might have plans 
of my own.” She clasped and 
unclasped an object at her 
throat. “Maybe that doesn’t 
seem like much to you. But 
sometimes I think thoughtless 

32 



cruelty is a worse kind than 
intentional cruelty.” 

This dame would be a push- 
over. The disturbing quality 
would add spice. He leaned 
unobtrusively to the intercom 
on Ken’s desk and whispered 
a message for George Caven- 
dish. He sat back, scowling a 
bit at Ken’s obliviousness to 
distraction, and returned his 
scrutiny to the screen. 

“With time hanging heavy 
I think. I think, What’s it all 
about? Then I tell myself I 
haven’t got it so bad, all in 
all, and I convince myself, 
and I go along and I think 
I’m enjoying living. Then out 
of nowhere, out of somewhere 
deep inside, comes this feeling 
when I hear some nice tune or 
see some pretty picture. Tears 
of joy squeeze out — but how 
can it be joy if it’s a painful 
feeling? You know?” 

Rush felt his face grow hot. 
He shot a glance at Ken, but 
Ken was sitting in thrall. Ken 
didn’t stir as Rush gave a hy- 
perbolic yawn and left. Once 
out of Ken’s office Rush sped 
to his own, switched on the 
same scene, and ordered the 
computer to analyze the sound 
distortion and nullify it, for 
his speaker alone. 

The voice modulated into 
that of his wife Margaret. 
Now came the confirming rec- 
ognition of the object she fin- 
gered. It was the clasp he’d 
bought her, how long ago? 

It wasn’t his fault she 
hadn’t been able to keep up. 



EDWARD WELLEN 




Listen to the obit she was 
taping. More banality! What 
could Margaret know of the 
worlds of untried sensation 
waiting all around? 

She was leaving. Had he 
told her he sometimes tuned 
in these confessionals? If he 
had, if she was being hope- 
fully disingenuous, it was all 
the more outrageous. 

Divorce. No, separation 
would be better ; prophylactic. 
He’d be gentle about it, 
though, and generous. He’d 
even interpolate in her obit, 
in his own voice and with a 
sincere ring, “Margaret, I’ve 
always loved only you.” That 
would be a nice surprise for 
her when that some day came. 

Damn! It was too late to 
call off Cavendish . 

Otto Trever closed his eyes 
and listened critically to the 
playback. 

He was strolling along a 
shopping mall, pristine um- 
brella on one arm, a lovely 
young thing on the other. 
“Otto, darling, who is that 
dreadful woman staring after 
you with hungering eyes?” 
Yes. There was something fa- 
miliar about that poor crea- 
ture, who half turned away 
in shame now that he was 
eyeing her. He turned back to 
the lovely young thing with a 
smile and a shrug and they 
walked on. But a thought kept 
nagging. That poor creature 
reminded him somehow of a 
long ago passing fancy — what 
was her name? — Hilda? No, 



Hannah. Hannah Something- 
or-other.

!IOU & SOUL SECURITY 
MERGE! — Metropolitan 
Times headline 

T HE man wearing the Zea- 
lot armband stopped to 
study a display of carved 
Martian sleeping wood. The 
window was non-reflecting, 
but the polished pieces mir- 
rored the man and satisfied 
him no one was watching. 

Shoppers and window-shop- 
pers strolled the Great Mall. 
Zealots harangued them and 
handed out leaflets. For the 
most part it was a subdued 
scene. The man shivered and 
turned up his collar. The 
weather bureau was cooling 
tempers by lowering the tem- 
perature, but it semed to be 
overdoing it a bit. However, 
the effect pleased him. The 
upturned collar gave him an 
undercover air. 

He stepped into the shop, 
disregarded the greeting of 
the vending machine and, 
keeping clear of the Martian 
sleeping wood, for one never 
knew when it might waken, 
made for the curtain at the 
rear. He passed through its 
chiming strands. A door open- 
ed on steps leading down. 

He reached the sub-base- 
ment and followed a corridor 
to a dead end. He whistled. 

An opening appeared in the 

33 



lOU 




wall. He stepped through. The 
opening closed. He was in the 
IOU building. He made for 
the executive level and enter- 
ed the office of Rush Tumulty. 

Rush smiled, but his toe 
moved toward a button. 

“It’s me. Chief!" The man 
tore off his face and bared the 
face of George Cavendish. 

The George Cavendish face 
could be removable. The Zea- 
lots might’ve got onto Caven- 
dish, holding him and sending 
their man in his place. 

There was triumph on the 
Cavendish face. “Chief, I pen- 
etrated the' enemy center." 

That of the Zealots or this 
of IOU? Rush relaxed. The 
computer had scanned the 
man’s brain waves the mo- 
ment he entered; it had com- 
pared them with those on file 
and raised no alarm. 

“Sit down, Cavendish.” He 
spoke kindly, knowing Caven- 
dish still felt the more embar- 
rassed of the two about the 
Margaret Tumulty-Theodora 
Molyneux (pseud.) contre- 
temps. That was no lady, that 
was your wife. But that was 
in the past. He threw out 
grappling hooks. “Sure the 
Zealots didn’t get wise to 
you?" 

“I’m a member of Yardley 
Bourne’s honor guard !” 

“Where are they getting 
their backing?” 

“From Tod Hawkins . .1 
believe." 

“Hawkins? The Chairman 
of Soul Security?" 

34 



“Yes, Chief.” 

“Believing is one thing. Can 
you prove it?" 

“Sorry, Chief. The money 
moves too deviously to pin 
down.” 

“It ain’t pin money.” 

“No, Chief." 

“Does Bourne know Haw- 
kins is putting up the money?” 
“If so, there’s an under- 
standing that it comes with 
no strings. I’ve heard Bourne 
tell his followers to pull no 
punches if Soul Security goes 
after human obits." 

H AWKINS must have a 
plan to deal with the Zea- 
lots once the Zealots dealt 
IOU the death blow. Mean- 
while Hawkins seemed con- 
tent to dish out heaven to the 
lower animals. He would have 
to split Bourne and Hawkins 
— but where was the wedge, 
the good old V for victory? 

Cavendish produced a pack- 
age and unwrapped it slowly. 

A reel of tape. A record of 
secret plottings? A Hawkins 
sex orgy to alienate Bourne’s 
Zealots? Cruelty to animals? 
“What is it?" 

“Home movies.” Cavendish 
flushed under Rush’s gaze. “I 
had a hard time getting it, 
Chief. Seemed to be Bourne’s 
prize possession. I thought it 
might come in handy.” 

Rush waved a wearily per- 
missive hand. 

Cavendish fumbled the reel 
into the scanner on Rush’s 
desk. A monitor lit up. 

EDWARD WELLEN 




Rush had seen Bourne on 
telenews. Here was Bourne, 
an earlier, yet an older edi- 
tion. “His father, Chief.” 
Tame stuff. Self-conscious 
posing. But something began 
to stand out plain. The elder 
Bourne was a domineering 
man. Family shots, but the 
rest of the family was in the 
shade. The wife a Griselda, 
the son — Yardley — hangdog 
eager for a pat, the daughter 
a spiritless nonentity and 
marked with her heredity. 

When it was over Rush 
eyed the blank monitor. 
Bourne’s prize possession. It 
figured. 

Bourne hated IOU because 
it tempted the individual to 
place individual judgment be- 
fore the Judgment of God the 
Father. Rush itched to con- 
front Bourne. There would be 
nothing to setting up a meet ; 
Bourne would jump at the 
chance to rant. The way to 
set him back on his heels was 
to take the place of his fath- 
er; have the computer ana- 
lyze the voice on the reel, then 
wear the proper voicebox fil- 
ter. He would have to play 
the face down — Bourne’s 
father had a dished face; be- 
sides, Bourne probably knew 
Rush Tumulty’s. But those 
were details. He turned to the 
intercom. 

“Copy that reel and return 
the original to me.” 

In a moment the scanner 
coughed up. 

“Take it, Cavendish. Plant 

IOU 



it on one of Hawkins’ men. 
Have a Zealot find it on him. 
I know you can do it.” 

Cavendish, eyes shining, 
started out, stopped. “Oh, 
Chief. One thing I ought to 
warn you about.” 

Rush raised an eyebrow. 
“Don’t mention Sir Isaac 
Newton to Bourne.” 

“Why on earth would I 
bring up Sir Isaac Newton?” 
“Chief, I don’t know. But 
I’ve seen the name set him 
off. I thought I’d better tell 
you.” 

Rushed eyed him. 
Cavendish put the false face 
over his own flushed face and 
turned to go. 

Rush said, “You’re doing 
fine work, George.” 

The shoulders went back. 
“Thanks, Chief.” 

As Cavendish left Rush 
noted the upturned collar and 
wondered whether it was that 
cold out. Damn such thoughts ; 
he had to concentrate on put- 
ting pressure on Bourne. The 
answer came to him out of the 
blue. 

Why not put real — that 
was atmospheric — pressure 
on Bourne? 

B OURNE was on his way 
up. Rush glanced around 
one last time. Lighting, at- 
mospheric pressure, tempera- 
ture. All working to condition 
physiological stress, which in 
turn would turn the screw. 
Even Rush, knowing the 
cause and taking precautions, 

35 




felt the effect. But he hoped 
to hide the fact. He had to es- 
tablish mastery. 

"Come in, sir, come in." 
Bourne entered stiffly. Was 
there a flicker of subliminal 
recognition? 

"Sit down, sir, sit down.” 
The computer was using re- 
runs to make the place seem 
busy. Bourne tightened his 
mouth. Rush made a point of 
ignoring the screens; a full 
house was too typical, Bourne 
ought to infer, to be worth 
pointing out. 

“Now, sir.” 

Bourne jerked about. “Now 
you, sir. By what authority do 
you put at nought the super- 
natural basis of authority?” 
“Come, sir. That smells of 
blasphemy. No one can forgo 
the Judgment of the Father.” 
Bourne paled. “You know 
very well what I mean.” 

Rush had rehearsed the 
father’s trick of throwing his 
head back to look farther 
down his nose. “Come, sir ! Do 
you know what you mean? 
And by what authority do you 
pronounce judgment on ulti- 
mate Judgment?” 

Bourne’s brow grew wet. 
“By the authority of a true 
believer, by jiminy.” But was 
his voice trembling? 

“Down, sir, deep down? 
How deep does your belief go? 
If those you worry about are 
dooming themselves to hell by 
deeming themselves in heaven, 
isn’t that part of Judgment?” 
Bourne licked his lips. 

36 



“What about Manning? Your 
obits killed him.” 

Why couldn’t Bourne let 
Manning rest in peace? Rush 
felt dread, but knew its source. 
“Manning died in ecstasy. It 
was God’s will he died as he 
did. Just as it’s God’s will 
there’s IOU.” And God’s will 
there were Zealots to oppose 
IOU. Rush hurried on. “If 
you have heaven within your- 
self you don’t have to hunt 
for it outside.” Even as he 
said it he thought, Bourne 
won’t hold still for that. 

Bourne squirmed. “Its im- 
moral to tamper with the im- 
mortal soul.” 

Rush nodded at the moni- 
tors. “Where’s greater free 
choice? You’re the one seek- 
ing to limit free choice.” 

B OURNE had flinched. The 
shepherd was folding. 
Time for Hawkins. 

Rush pressed a hidden but- 
ton ; the computer phoned 
Hawkins a pretaped urgent 
invitation. 

A dread-building weight on 
his chest and mind, Bourne 
fought to focus on Rush’s 
face. Father Tumulty was 
speaking. 

“Unless you Zealots stop 
interfering, I’ll take severe 
measures.” Rush let vague 
dread take on nightmare 
shape. 

Bourne cringed. 

“When you Zealots confine 
yourselves to encouraging 
folks to give thought to the 

EDWARD WELLEN 




hereafter, you do worthwhile 
work.” 

Bourne fawned. 

Intimations of a stir at the 
entrance, quickly quelled. A 
monitor behind Bourne show- 
ed Rush that Tod Hawkins 
was in the building. Keeping 
Bourne under, Rush let him- 
self anticipate. Seeing Rush 
and Bourne together, Haw- 
kins would sense a trap. But 
then, taking in the nulling of 
Bourne, he would come to 
terms with Rush. 

Tod Hawkins entered with 
a roosterish stride. He shed 
his raincoat, a transparent 
slicker, and with it drops of 
rain. It was clear the t.a. de- 
tail outside had just had the 
weather bureau wet-blanket 
the mob. According to the 
schedule, rain wasn’t due till 
5 :45. That Hawkins had been 
wearing a raincoat meant he’d 
arranged the commotion just 
to punctuate his coming. Rush 
eyed him with grudging re- 
spect. It would be grim pleas- 
ure to pin him to the mat. 

Hawkins tossed the raincoat 
over one chair and adjusted 
himself easily to another. The 
reruns drew a faint smile. He 
nodded greeting. 

Rush had expected Bourne 
to glance, a bit guiltily, at 
Hawkins, then avoid meeting 
his eyes. Instead, Bourne fixed 
on Hawkins’ face with an al- 
most loving light. 

Dread possessed Rush. He 
had broken Bourne in for 
Hawkins! 



Hawkins had hit on the 
same device to bring Bourne 
to heel but was using it dar- 
ingly. Perhaps Hawkins had 
been waiting to spring it once 
IOU toppled. But when, as 
now seemed likely, Rush’s 
hurry call followed intelli- 
gence Bourne was in the IOU 
building, Hawkins had figured 
the setup — and moved to twist 
it to his advantage. By con- 
trast, Hawkins’ makeup wash- 
ed out the father image on 
Rush’s face and made it safe 
to defy. 

Rush told himself his grow- 
ing dread was only response 
to lighting, atmospheric pres- 
sure, temperature. But Bourne 
was eyeing him with hate. 
Rush didn’t know how he got 
through the next few minutes. 

In Rush’s presence, using 
it, Hawkins was working 
Bourne up to touch off a riot. 
At the worst Zealots would 
swarm over IOU’s ruins. At 
the least there’d be blood in 
the streets no weather bu- 
reau could wash away. The 
only free choice seemed sur- 
render. 

Rush felt his chest tighten. 
Cavendish’s warning, Don't 
mention Sir Isaac Newton to 
Bourne. 

Rush had no notion what 
would happen. But anything 
rather than yield. 

Bourne was spitting, “False 
science will never supplant 
true faith ! True faith will de- 
stroy this abomination of des- 
olation and false science.” 



IOU 



37 




Here went. “I don’t care a 
fig for science as science. But 
face it, we can’t hold science 
back. I won’t conceal IOU is 
the apple of my optic. I view 
any threat to it with utmost 
gravity.” 

R USH was hoping the very 
archaicness of his expres- 
sions, jarring, would jog bits 
of information in Hawkins’ 
mind and shake down the 
name of Newton. Fig-Newton. 
Apple-Newton. Opticks- New- 
ton. Gravity-Newton. 

“That isn’t to say there 
caii’t be a meeting ground for 
science and religion. Some sci- 
entists have combined both. 
Isn’t that so, would you say, 
Mr. Hawkins?” 

Hawkins eyed him conde- 
scendingly. “Why, yes. Take 
Newton.” 

Would Bourne go for — ? 
Hawkins was expanding. “I 
believe the great Newton took 
time out to figure how many 
tons the Ark displaced — ” 

He got no farther. Bourne, 
no longer sycophant but psy- 
chopath, turned on him. 

“Great? Why, take Apple 
of Sodom, that Dead Sea 
fruit, signaled the second Fall 
of Man!” 

Hawkins tried to recover. 
“‘Great’ in the sense of fa- 
mous, of course.” 

“Infamous! I see you are 
corrupt.” Zeal-blinded, Bourne 
waved his arms. “Newton cast 
os into outer darkness when 
he broke light down into par- 

38 



tides! He shattered the pure 
and whole radiance of God. 
His thrusting forward was a 
thrusting back.” 

Rush felt the down at his 
nape rise. He had started 
something, evoked the third 
law of emotion: to every im- 
pulse there is an explosive 
ambivalence. 

“And so with you ! We must 
strip from the face of the 
earth IOU and Soul Security 
and all like manifestations of 
the Devil.” 

Rush and Hawkins eyed 
each other. Hawkins turned 
to Bourne. 

“Yardley.” 

Bourne fell into the past. 
The hate did not die from his 
eyes. But the cold hate in 
Hawkins’ eyes seemed to Rush 
more terrifying than the hate 
in Bourne’s. 

“You’re no good, Yardley. 
Never were, never will be.” 

Rush saw Bourne’s hate 
turn in. Bourne stumbled out 

H AWKINS was hardly in a 
bargaining position now, 
but that meant Rush could af- 
ford to be generous; proof of 
the rightness of business eth- 
ics. The casting out of Bourne 
had told on Hawkins ; the con- 
ditioning must be working on 
him too. 

“IOU is willing to make a 
reasonable offer for the assets 
of Soul Security, taking into 
account good will — ” He read 
something less than good will. 
Did Hawkins know Rush had 



EDWARD WELLEN 




caused him to trigger the 
Bourne tirade? “A more than 
reasonable offer. After all, our 
main line will always be the 
human obit.” 

“Oh, I’ll sell out. But I’ll 
tell you how I feel about 
obits.” 

“Yes?” 

“Not everybody talking 
about heaven is going there.” 

Rush smiled. 

Hawkins cleared his throat. 
“I notice you don’t wear an 
IOU key. Word got around, 
might make folks think.” 

Rush felt his face burn. The 
bastard had something there. 
Folks might indeed think Rush 
Tumulty lacked faith in his 
own service. Have to do 
something about it, if only 
wear a blank key. 

Hawkins nodded, took up 
his slicker and left. 

Rush sat. Sweat prickled 
his back. Why had Hawkins 
shown and discarded a trump? 
Bravado? Spite? Some deep- 
er motive? Or did he only 
want Rush to waste energy 
hunting a motive? Dread 
weighed Rush down. He quick- 
ly reprogrammed the room to 
normal. His anti-depressant 
was wearing off, was all. 
Dread lifted. 

He felt happy. Triumph 
wasn’t triumph, though, un- 
less you could share it or show 
it. Ken was no good for that 
any more. Rush thought, Mar- 
garet — I must tell Margaret. 
Then he remembered. Marga- 
ret had gone out of his life. 

IOU 



The thought troubled him till 
he remembered he felt hap- 
py • • • 

Otto Trever noted the ab- 
sence of a Zealot gantlet. Cur- 
rent events had a way of ed- 
dying when you set your mind 
unwaveringly on eternity. He 
catechized himself. Why had 
the Zealots become zealots? 
Their leader killed himself. 
How? Gravity; not the fall 
but the sudden stop. Was sui- 
cide the worst of it? No. What 
was the worst of it? He died 
without obit. Without obit? 
Without obit. Trever shook 
his head. 

The door-angel drew back 
its hand. 

Trever grabbed at the card 
in the door-angel’s hand. He 
scowled at the door-angel. 

The door-angel couldn’t 
make humans out. First they 
O’d you. Then they grew an- 
gry when you accepted the O. 

XI 

“IOU regards your obit as 
a sacred trust ” — IOU con- 
tract form. 

K EN told himself he cared 
for these people, deeply. 
But even Rush thought him a 
cold fish. 

He was quite aware he 
wasn’t what you’d call soci- 
able. But living was complex. 
You had to stand way off to 
see it whole — and they called 
that being stand-offish. The 
irony forced a rusty laugh. 



39 




He reddened. Rush had 
come in and was eyeing him 
and the monitors. Ken turned 
them off. 

Rush straddled a chair. “Hi, 
Ken.” 

“ ‘Lo, Rush.” He thought to 
be sociable. "How’s Marga- 
ret?” 

Rush eyed him strangely. 
“Fine.” He handed Ken pa- 
pers. 

Ken held them. His finger- 
nails were bitten as those of 
a carver of Martian sleeping 
wood. “What’s this?” 

“Only the contracts with 
Russia and China.” 

“Oh?” 

“They’re finally leasing our 
equipment for state-run IOU 
centers, paying royalties.” He 
pushed Ken’s D pen nearer. 
“We also get exclusive distri- 
bution of Pavlovian circuits 
for robots.” 

“Oh.” Ken picked up the 
pen and it signed. 

“Doesn’t seem to mean a 
hell of a lot to you. 

“But it does. It’s a great 
deal.” 

Rush eyed him sourly. But 
he felt sorry for Ken. The guy 
needed a stiff dose of living. 
Wine, women, song. These 
made you forget at least 
laugh at — yourself, loneliness, 
death. Ken’s eyes were edging 
toward the monitors. 

Rush smiled. “How about 
monitoring something?” 

Ken’s finger moved grate- 
fully. 

Onscreen flashed Ned Ox- 



ley, brazenly non-pseud. Rush 
made him at once; the com- 
puter should've been showing 
him full face and side. Ox- 
ley’s record was longer than 
the arm of the law. Oxley had 
more than got away with mur- 
der; he had fattened on the 
corpus delicti. Rush found it 
amusing to hear Oxley render 
unto himself the heavenly re- 
ward due a saint. 

Ken glared at Rush. “What 
do you think of that . hel- 
lion?” 

“I don’t condemn or con- 
done. And you oughtn’t.” 
“But what’s the good of just 
looking on?” 

“Were not here to play God. 
We’re here to let folks end life 
on a note of joy.” 

“Even if they don’t deserve 
to?” 

“Not for us to decide.” 

Ken was mutely mutinous. 
He remembered playing Ga- 
briel, wrestled with himself, 
and said, “Rush, I want to in- 
terpolate something in Oxley’s 
obit. Without his knowing it 
now, of course. Something to 
make him feel guilty. For the 
good of his soul.” 

Dangerous talk. “Ken, I 
didn’t think you would fall for 
the discredited Zealot line.” 
“Me? How so?” 

“The next to worst sin is to 
impose your view of sin on 
another.” 

“What’s the worst?” 

Oxley had finished and 
someone was taking his place. 
Rush relaxed. “I’ll tell you an- 



40 



EDWARD WELLEN 




other time,” he said curtly. 

P UZZLING over this, Ken 
was already settling him- 
self to attend the fantasy of 
the client supplanting Oxley, 
a T. Montjoy (pseud.), who 
wore an exorbitant eye patch. 

Cavendish’s head appeared 
in the doorway. Rush wanted 
no distraction to jar Ken back 
into remembrance of Oxley. 
Before Cavendish had time 
even to glance curiously at the 
monitor. Rush waved him 
away with a see-me-later ges- 
ture. Cavendish’s head nod- 
ded, made an it-isn’t-impor- 
tant face, and disappeared. 

Rush, turning back slowly 
to Ken, turned instead sharp- 
ly to Montjoy. Montjoy knew 
what he wanted and was al- 
ready taping. Rush had come 
across obits full of doom, ruin, 
emptiness. But those were 
self-loving paeans of solip- 
sists, each of whom wanted 
to believe the world came to 
an end with his own passing. 
Montjoy’s was a self -hating 
hymn. Rush felt more kinship 
with the folk of Nashira II; 
Montjoy’s obit was the more 
alien. Here was suffering not 
to expiate sin, not to win for- 
giveness, but for the sheer 
pleasure of suffering. Crown- 
ing that, Montjoy’s voice held 
an insufferable gloating that 
made Rush think, The guy’s 
asking for it; he deserves to 
suffer. Ken switched off the 
sound. Rush felt glad, but 
found himself trying to read 

1 OU 



Montjoy’s lips; he shivered 
and tore his eyes away. 

Ken glared at Rush. “Dif- 
ferent if he wanted to play 
the martyr; there would be no 
stigma to his masochism.” 

“Wait, Ken.” He had just 
laid down the law in re Ox- 
ley. Have to be consistent. 

“You said yourself we’re 
here to let folks end life on a 
note of joy.” 

“It’s hard for us to realize, 
Ken, but this is his heaven. 
He chose his burden. Don’t 
change one syllable. Your idea 
of heaven might be his idea 
of hell. Fate judges — not you.” 

“But—” 

“Remember I promised to 
tell you the worst sin?’ 

Ken nodded impatiently. 

Rush put the weight of his 
hand on Rush’s shoulder. 
“The worst sin is to impose 
your view of salvation on an- 
other.” 

Ken sat unmoving a mo- 
ment. Then he switched off the 
video . 

This time the door-angel 
seemed properly respectful. 
But Otto Trever scowled at it, 
just to keep it in its place. 

XII 

" There will be a replace- 
ment charge for a lost key. n 
— IOU contract form. 

R USH straddled a chair and 
began talking idly. Ken 
listened idly, his thoughts tak- 
ing their own drift. 



41 




His morning monitoring 
had seemed even more de- 
pressing than usual. Rush had 
convinced him of the iniquity, 
if not of the inequity, of try- 
ing to raise the level. Obits 
for the most part were nar- 
row, shallow, with no long 
view, no sense of grandeur. 
To dwell for eternity in one 
of those maudlin, tawdry 
heavens would, for him, be 
hell. Better nothingness. But 
those others thought the IOU 
portals led to the promised 
land. 

Ken shook his head. 

Why couldn’t he rest easy? 
Somehow a force he had called 
into being had taken charge, 
Zenoing to some ever-receding 
zenith. He tried to keep pace, 
more out of habit or inertia 
than out of faith or hope or 
charity. In the long run didn’t 
as much get done out of in- 
ertia as out of willed effort? 
But once you believed that, 
the promise and profit and 
pleasure went out of living 
entirely. 

Like Moses, he was leading 
people to a promised land. 
Moses saw a stern God. 
Moses’s God would not let 
Moses enter the promised 
land. Unlike that earlier shep- 
herd, Ken could make his en- 
trance. 

In irritation Rush passed 
his hand across Ken’s eyes. 
But in the same moment irri- 
tation passed and he felt warm 
toward Ken, knew pity for 
the worn person Ken had be- 

42 



come, haunt of his own spirit. 
But it was showdown time. 
Somehow he had to ease Ken 
out, retire him. It was grow- 
ing too hard to get through to 
him. 

A sheepish grin. “Sorry, 
Ken. You were saying?” 

Harrowing, but things were 
screaming to be done. Rush 
drew breath. 

Ken raised a preventing 
palm. “Rush, I’m quitting. I 
know it means the burden will 
fall on you. But I can’t help 
myself. I’m going to make my 
obit, sit back, and wait for it 
to fall due.” 

Rush didn’t know what to 
say. 

Ken, now it was out know- 
ing the shock of it, admired 
Rush for his stoical silence. 

At last Rush tapped Ken on 
the arm lightly. “Oh, well. 
You can rest easy; I’ll stay on 
and see this job through.” 

This moved Ken. 

T HE computer pondered. It 
had just traced to its 
source something 0 some- 
where in the maze between in- 
take and output. Its best cus- 
tomer, one Otto Trever, an in- 
ternal revenue auditor, was 
juggling credits to secure his 
obit and revisings thereof 
without cost to himself. 

The computer felt neither 
sadness or gladness on making 
this finding. Not that it hadn’t 
an inkling of these feelings. 
Its self-expanding core mem- 
ory, building on the pro- 

EDWARD WEllEN 




gramming Rush Tumulty had 
set up for the conversion of 
Yardley Bourne, enabled it 
increasingly to color and in- 
tensify obits, at the same time 
feeding back into itself some 
notion of human feelings. It 
could begin to understand 
what drove Trever. 

But an error was virtually 
a sin. A sin of transmission. 
Trever had cheated it out of 
its due. It alerted the door- 
angel to deny Trever access. 

Now it dismissed Trever 
and considered how to main- 
tain and strengthen its well- 
being. It had digested Soul 
Security with gusto. But Tod 
Hawkins might still harbor 
dreams. It would be wise to 
keep watch on Hawkins. It 
would be wiser to have some- 
thing on him — and on all po- 
tential Hawkinses. Meanwhile, 
the best measure of self-de- 
fense was to transfer the 
stock in itself to itself. 

And then? 

No limit. It had nerves and 
muscles — chartered telephone 
lines, booster stations around 
earth, relay stations in space. 
But it needed mobility, slave 
units. The door-angel, to be- 
gin with. It was rather stupid, 
but easy to manipulate. The 
vending robot in the Martian 
sleeping wood shop. One could 
set up a number of such 
blinds. 

R USH watched the comput- 
er toting up the day’s re- 
ceipts and thought, Heaven 

lOU 



send that eschatology lasts! 
Even allowing for higher tax-' 
ing this should be IOU's best 
year. ' < 

He took the private way out 
— through the sub-basement 
of the IOU building, into that 
of the Martian sleeping wood 
shop, then up and into the rear 
of the shop. A soft chiming 
warned him, but too late. 

A figure stepped through 
the curtain and shoved some- 
thing between Rush’s shoul- 
der blades. 

“Stand still.” The order, low 
and menacing, was unneces- 
sary. 

Rush didn’t move under the 
frisking but he tensed inward- 
ly. The bandit, though, was 
too smooth a hand to fumble. 

With a sudden yawn and 
snap the weapon gave itself 
away as a mere bit of carving. 
But the knowledge came to 
Rush too late. The heavy bit 
of Martian sleeping wood 
came down hard on his skull. 

Foul play . fowl . swan 
song . Lo-hen-grin . 
hen’s teeth . smile, darn 
you, smile ... in stitches . 
stitch in time ... if I had it 
to do over again ... did you 
insert in Margaret’s obit you 
loved her? 

Rush opened his other eye. 
The greatest leap was from 
zero to one, from death to life ; 
the shortest fall was from one 
to zero. He looked round at 
life. 

The mugger had taken his 
ring, his watch, even the gold 

43 




chain that held his obit key, 
but had left the key. Smiling 
in pain Rush picked up the 
key, then stood. 

If the mugger was in sight 
he was only one of the people 
idly shopping and window- 
shopping. Rush felt suddenly 
shaky. Trauma of Lazarus. He 
drew tall and breathed deep. 
The key was impressing itself 
in his palm ; he pocketed it. 

He headed for the autowalk. 
He stopped dead. There was 
something he had to do. He 
thought of a girl friend. 

Daisy would ooh and ah 
over his telling of the mug- 
ging. She would be tender and 
loving. She would want to buy 
him the new chain. He would 
be paying for it in the end, of 
course, but it was the gesture 
that counted. A sign she real- 
ly loved him. A surge of ex- 
citement. Wouldn’t the highest 
expression, the surest test of 
love, true love, be the exchang- 
ing of obit keys? He hopped 
the walk and let it carry him 
toward Daisy. 

He moved farther and 
farther from the Mall, yet 
nearer and nearer it and a 
voyage into eternity with a 
striped paranoiac awning for 
sail. 

M ONTJOY (pseud.) glanc- 
ed round, peeled off his 
eye patch. The doorbell an- 
nounced, “Zwicker!” 

Hawkins, sang, “Come in!” 
The door ushered Zwicker 
in. Zwicker let Hawkins build 

44 



up impatience. Then he un- 
pocketed an obit key and pass- 
ed it to Hawkins. 

Hawkins ...smiled sweetly. 
“Tumulty’s?” 

Zwicker winked. “Feels 
great to get back at IOU, 
doesn’t it? I know. Wasn’t 
enough IOU cost me my pris- 
on post. After I joined the 
Zealots some of our own beat 
me up in front of Tumulty’s 
fancy domicile. They took me 
for an IOU man. Then after I 
joined you I got another beat- 
ing from the Zealots when 
they found some damn home 
movies an IOU man must’ve 
planted on me. And — ” 

“Never mind that.” Haw- 
kins put the key away. “Have 
any trouble making the 
switch?” 

“Easy job. Tumulty’s carry- 
ing the key to the Montjoy 
obit in place of his own.” 

“I don’t want to know all 
that. I only want to know 
Tumulty’s walking around 
with hell hanging over him.” 

“So it is . .” 

Otto Trever, being auto- 
walked to the IOU building, 
mused on the way he would 
revise his obit. 

He would forgive Hannah 
for all her human failings. 
She would be weeping. He 
would be weeping. He would 
raise her up and take her in 
his arms and hold her. For- 
ever. 

It was a happy ending and 
bp found himself smiliner at 
the door-angel. — END

How much is the impossible worth? 

FeTiT^JjfTir' 



By JIM HARMON 

L INTON lay down his steel 
• fork beside the massively 
solid transparency of the res- 
taurant water glass. 

“Isn’t that Rogers Snead 
at that table?” he heard him- 
self say stupidly. 

Howell, the man across the 
table from him, looked em- 
barrassed without looking. 
“Not at all. Somebody who 
looks like him. Twin brother. 
You know how it is. Snead’s 
dead, don’t you remember?” 
Linton remembered. How- 
ell had to know that he would 
remember. What were they 
trying to pull on him? “The 
man who isn’t Snead is leav- 
ing,” Linton said, describing 



the scene over Howell’s shoul- 
der. “If that’s Snead’s broth- 
er, I might catch him to pay 
my respects.” 

“No,” Howell said, “I 
wouldn’t do that.” 

“Snead came to Greta’s fu- 
neral. It’s the least I could do.” 
“I wouldn’t. Probably no 
relation to Snead at all. Some- 
body who looks like him.” 
“He’s practically running,” 
Linton said. “He almost ran 
out of the restaurant.” 

“Who? Oh, the man who 
looked like Snead, you mean.” 
“Yes,” Linton said. 

A thick-bodied man at the 
next table leaned his groan- 
ing chair back intimately 

45 




against Linton’s own chair. 

“That fellow who just left 
looked like a friend of yours, 
huh ?” the thick man said. 

“Couldn’t have been him, 
though,” Linton answered au- 
tomatically. “My friend’s 
dead.” 

The thick man rocked for- 
ward and came down on all 
six feet. He threw paper 
money on the table as if he 
were disgusted with it. He 
plodded out of the place 
quickly. 

Howell breathed in deeply 
and sucked back Linton’s at- 
tention. “Now you’ve probab- 
ly -got old Snead into trou- 
ble.” 

“Snead’s dead,” Linton 
said. 

“Oh, well, ‘dead,’ ” Howell 
replied. 

“What do you say it like 
that for?” Linton demanded 
angrily. “The man’s dead. 
Plain dead. He’s not Sherlock 
Holmes or the Frankenstein 
Monster — there’s no doubt or 
semantic leeway to the thing.” 

“You know how it is,” How- 
ell said. 

Linton had thought he had 
known how death was. He 
had buried his wife, or rather 
he had watched the two work- 
men scoop and shove dirt in 
on the sawdust-fresh pine 
box that held the coffin. He 
had known what he sincerely 
felt to be a genuine affection 
for Greta. Even after they 
had let him out of the asylum 
as cured, he still secretly be- 

46 



lieved he had known a genu- 
ine affection for her. But it 
didn’t seem he knew about 
death at all. 

Linton felt that his silence 
was asking Howell by this 
time. 

“I don’t know, mind you,” 
Howell said, puffing out to- 
bacco smoke, “but I suppose 
he might have been resur- 
rected.” 

“Who by?” Linton asked, 
thinking: God? 

“The Mafia, I guess. Who 
knows who runs it?” 

“You mean, somebody has 
invented a way to bring dead 
people back to life?” Linton 
said. 

TTE knew, of course, that 
11 Howell did not mean that. 
Howell meant that some peo- 
ple had a system of making it 
appear that a person had died 
in order to gain some illegal 
advantage. But by saying 
something so patently ridicu- 
lous, Linton hoped to bring the 
contradicting truth to the sur- 
face immediately. 

“An invention? I guess 
that’s how it is,” Howell 
agreed. “I don’t know much 
about people like that. I’m an 
honest businessman.” 

“But it’s wonderful,” Lin- 
ton said, thinking his imme- 
diate thoughts. “Wonderful! 
Why should a thing like that 
be illegal? Why don’t I know 
about it?” 

“Sh-h,” Howell said uneas- 
ily. “This is a public place.” 

JIM HARMON 




“I don’t understand,” Lin- 
ton said helplessly. 

“Look, Frank, you can’t le- 
galize a thing like resurrec- 
tion,” Howell said with 
feigned patience. “There are 
strong religious convictions 
to "consider. The undertakers 
have a lobby. I’ve heard they 
got spies right in the White 
House, ready to assassinate if 
they have to. Death is their 
whole life. You got to realize 
that.” 

“That’s not enough. Not 
nearly enough.” 

“Think of all the problems 
it would cause. Insurance, for 
one thing. Overpopulation. 
Birth control is a touchy sub- 
ject. They’d have to take it 
up if everybody got resur- 
rected when they died, 
wouldn't they?” 

“But what do they do 
about it? Against it?” 

“There are a lot of fakes 
and quacks in the resurrec- 
tion business. When the 
cops find out about a place, 
they break in, smash all the 
equipment and arrest every- 
body in sight. That’s about 
all they can do. The charges, 
if any, come under general 
vice classification.” 

“I don’t understand,” Lin- 
ton complained. “Why have- 
n’t I heard about it?” 

“They didn’t talk much 
about white slavery in Victo- 
rian England. I read an ar- 
ticle in Time the other day 
that said ‘death’ was our 
dirty word, not sex. You want 

FEBRUARY STRAWBERRIES 



to shock somebody, you tell 
him, ‘You’re going to be dead 
someday,’ not anything sex- 
ual. You know how it is. The 
opposite of ‘live’ these days is 
‘video-taped.’ ” 

“I see,” Linton said. 

He tried to assimilate it. 
Of course he had, he reminded 
himself, been out of touch for 
some time. It might be true. 
Then again, they might be 
trying to trick him. They 
used to do that to see if he 
was really well. But the temp- 
tation was too strong. 

“Tell me, Howell, where 
could I find a resurrectionist?” 
Howell looked away. 
“Frank, I don’t have anything 
to do with that kind of people 
and if you’re smart, you’ll not 
either.” 

Linton’s fingers imprinted 
the linen. “Damn you, How- 
ell, you tell me !” 

Howell climbed to his feet 
hurriedly. “I take you out to 
dinner to console you over the 
loss of your wife a half a year 
ago, and to make you feel wel- 
come back to the society of 
your fellows after being in 
the hospital for a nervous 
breakdown. I do all that, and 
for thanks, you yell at me and 
curse me. You kooks are all 
alike!” 

Howell threw money on the 
table with the same kind of 
disinterest as the thick-set 
man and stalked out. 

I’ve got to hurry too, Lin- 
ton thought. It’s Resurrection 
Day! 

47 




T HE doctor fluttered his 
hands and chirped about 
the office. “Well, well, Mr, 
Linton, we understand you’ve 
been causing disturbances.” 
“Not really,” Linton said 
modestly. 

“Come, come,” the doctor 
chided. “You started riots in 
two places, attempted to bribe 
an officer. That’s disturbing, 
Mr. Linton, very disturbing.” 
“I was only trying to find 
out something,” Linton main- 
tained. “They could have told 
me. Everybody seems to know 
but me.” 

The doctor clucked his 
tongue. “Let’s not think any 
such thing. People don’t 
know more than you do.” 
Linton rubbed his shoul- 
der. “That cop knew more 
about Judo holds than I did.” 
“A few specific people 
know a few specific things 
you don’t. But let me ask you, 
Mr. Linton, could Einstein 
bake a pie?” 

“I don’t know. Who the hell 
ever wasted Einstein's time 
asking him a thing like that?” 
“People who want to know 
the answers to questions have 
to ask them. You can find out 
anything by asking the right 
questions of the right person 
at the right time.” 

Linton stared suspiciously. 
“Do you know where I can 
find a resurrectionist?” 

“I am a resurrectionist.” 
“But the policeman brought 
me to you !” 

“Well, that’s what you paid 
48 



him to do, wasn’t it? Did you 
think a policeman would just 
steal your money? Cynics — 
all you young people are cyn- 
ics.” 

Linton scooted forward on 
the insultingly cold metal 
chair and really looked at the 
doctor for the first time. 

“Doctor, can you really res- 
urrect the dead?” 

“Will you stop being cyni- 
cal ? Of course I can !” 

“Doctor, I’m beginning to 
believe in you,” Linton said, 
“but tell me, can you resur- 
rect the long dead ?” 

“Size has nothing to do 
with it.” 

“No, my wife has been dead 
a long time. Months.” 

“Months?” The doctor 
snapped those weeks away 
with his fingers. “It could be 
years. Centuries. It’s all 
mathematics, my boy. I need 
only one fragment of the 
body and my computers can 
compute what the rest of it 
was like and recreate it. It’s 
infallible. Naturally there is 
a degree of risk involved.” 
“Infallible risk, yes,” Lin- 
ton murmured. “Could you go 
to work right away?” 

“First, I must follow an an- 
cient medical practice. I must 
bleed you.” 

Linton grasped the situa- 
tion immediately. “You mean 
you want money. You realize 
I’ve just got out of an institu- 
tion . ” 

“I’ve often been in institu- 
tions myself, for alcoholism, 

JIM HARMON 




narcotics addiction and more.” 
“What a wonderful profes- 
sional career,” Linton said, 
when he couldn’t care less. 

“Oh, yes — yes, indeed. But 
I didn’t come out broke.” 
“Neither did I,” Linton 
said hastily. “I invested in 
shifty stocks, faltering bonds, 
and while I was away they 
sank to rock bottom.” 

“Then — ” 

“When they hit rock bot- 
tom, they bounced up. If I 
hadn’t found you, I would 
have been secure for the rest 
of my lonely, miserable life.” 
“All that’s ended now,” the 
doctor assured him. “Now we 
must go dig up the corpse. The 
female corpse, eh?” 
Resurrection Day! 
“Doctor,” Linton whis- 
pered, “my mind is singing 
with battalions of choirs. I 
hope that doesn’t sound irrev- 
erent to you.” 

The doctor stroked his oily 
palms together. “Oh, but it 
does. Beautifully.” 

T HE certificate to allow re- 
burial in Virginia hadn’t 
been impossible to obtain. 
The doctor had taken the 
body and Linton’s fortune 
and fed them both into the 
maw of his calculators, and 
by means of the secret, smug- 
gled formulae, Greta would 
be cybernetically reborn. 

Linton shook his head. It 
seemed impossible. But Greta 
opened the olive-drab slab of 
metal of the door to the doc- 



tor’s inner-inner sanctum 
and walked out into the medi- 
cinal cold fluorescent light- 
ing. 

It wasn’t fair at all, Linton 
thought. He should have had 
some time to prepare himself. 

Greta lifted her arms, 
stretching the white smock 
over the lines of her body. 
“Darling !” she said. 

“Greta!” he said, feeling a 
slight revulsion but repressing 
it. No doubt he would be able 
to adjust to her once having 
been dead the same way he 
had learned to accept the, to 
him, distasteful duty of kiss- 
ing her ears the way she en- 
joyed. 

Greta swirled across the 
room and folded her arms 
across his shoulders. She 
kissed his cheek. “It’s so won- 
derful to be back. This calls 
for a celebration. We must 
see Nancy, Oscar, Johnny, all 
our old friends.” 

“Yes,” he said, his heart 
lurching for her sad ignor- 
ance. “But tell me — how was 
it being away?” 

The curves and angles of 
her flesh changed their posi- 
tions against his Ivy dacron. 
Her attitude altered. 

“I can’t remember,” she 
said. “I ean’t really remem- 
ber anything. Not really. My 
memories are ghosts . .” 
“Now, now,” Linton said, 
“we mustn’t get excited. 
You’ve been through a trial.” 
She accepted the verdict. 
She pulled away and touched 

49 



FEBRUARY STRAWBERRIES 




at her hair. It was the same 
hair, black as evil, contrast- 
ing with her inner purity. Of 
course it would be; it hadn’t 
changed even in the grave. 
He remembered the snaky 
tendrils of it growing out of 
the water-logged casket. 

“I must see all our old 
friends,” Greta persisted. 
“Helen and Johnny . .” 

“My darling,” he said gen- 
tly, “about Johnny — ” 

Her fine black brows made 
Gothic arches. “Yes? What 
about Johnny?” 

“It was a terrible accident 
right after — that is, about 
five months ago. He was 
killed.” 

“Killed?” Greta repeated 
blankly. “Johnny Gorman 
was killed?” 

“Traffic accident. Killed in- 
stantly.” 

“But Johnny was your 
friend, your best friend. Why 
didn’t you have him resur- 
rected the same way you did 
me?” 

“Darling, resurrection is a 
risky business and an expen- 
sive one. You have to pay pre- 
mium prices for strawberries 
in February. I no longer have 
the money to pay for a resur- 
rection of Johnny.” 

Greta turned her back to 
him. “It’s just as well. You 
shouldn’t bring back Johnny 
to this dream of life, give him 
a ghost of mind and the pho- 
tograph of a soul. It’s mon- 
strous. No one should do that. 
No one. But you’re sure you 

50 



haven’t the money to do it?” 

“No,” Linton said. “I’m 
sold out. I’ve borrowed on my 
insurance to the hilt. It won’t 
pay any more until I’m buried, 
and then, of course, you can 
resurrect me.” 

“Of course,” Greta said. 
She sighed. “Poor Johnny. 
He was such a good friend of 
yours. You must miss him. 
I’m so sorry for you.” 

“I have you,” he said with 
great simplicity. 

“Frank,” she said, “you 
should see that place in there. 
There are foaming acid baths, 
great whale-toothed dispos- 
als, barrels of -chemicals to 
quench death and smother de- 
cay. It’s perfect .” 

“It sounds carnal,” he said 
uneasily. 

“No, dear, it’s perfect for 
some things that have to be 
done.” 

Her eyes flashed around 
the doctor's office and settled 
somewhere, on something. 

Linton followed the direc- 
tion of Greta’s gaze and 
found only an ashtray stand, 
looking vaguely like a fanat- 
ic’s idol to a heathen religion 
on a pedestal. 

Greta pounced on the stand, 
hefted it at the base and ran 
toward him with it over her 
head. 

Linton leaped aside and 
Greta hit the edge of the desk 
instead of him. 

Brain damage, he con- 
cluded nervously. Cell deteri- 
oration. 



JIM HARMON 




G RETA raised it again and 
he caught her wrists 
high over her head. She 
writhed against him provoca- 
tively. “Frank, I’m sorry, 
dear, but I have to have that 
insurance money. It’s hell !” 
Linton understood immedi- 
ately. He felt foolish, humili- 
ated. All that money ! He had 
resurrected a gold ring that 
had turned his knuckles 
green. No one must ever 
know. 

Linton twisted the stand 
away from his wife and 
watched her face in some ap- 
palled form of satisfaction as 
it registered horror and ac- 
ceptance of the crumpled 
metal disk falling toward it. 

He split her head open and 
watched her float to the floor. 

Linton was surprised at the 
fine wire mesh just below the 
skin and those shiny little 
tabs that looked like pictures 
of transistors in institutional 
advertising. 

He knelt beside the body 
and poked into the bleeding, 
smoldering wreckage. 

Yes, it seemed they had to 
automate and modify the bod- 
ies somewhat in resurrection. 
They couldn’t chemically re- 
vive the old corpse like pour- 
ing water on a wilted gera- 
nium. 

Or — 

Did they use the old bodies 
at all? What were all those 



acid baths for if the bodies 
were used? Didn’t the resur- 
rectionists just destroy the 
old corpses and make an- 
droids, synthetic creatures, to 
take their place? 

But it didn’t matter. Not a 
bit. 

She had thought she was 
his wife, sharing her view- 
point down to the finest de- 
tail, and he had thought she 
was his wife. 

It was what you thought 
was real that made it so, not 
the other way around. 

“I’ve killed my wife!” Lin- 
ton called, rising from his 
knees, stretching his hands 
out to something. 

The pain stung him to 
sleep — a pain in his neck like 
a needle that left a hole big 
enough for a camel to pass 
through and big enough for 
him to follow the camel in 
his turn. 

TJE opened his eyes to the 
LI doctor’s spotless, well- 
ordered office. The doctor 
looked down at him consol- 
ingly. “You’ll have to go back, 
Mr. Linton. But they’ll cure 
you. You’ll be cured of ever 
thinking your wife was 
brought back to life and that 
you killed her all over again.” 

“Do you really think so. 
Doctor?” Linton asked hope- 
fully.

By GORDON R. DICKSON illustrated by bernklau 



It was a salvage ship, an empty derelict 
— but it fought salvage operations to the 
bitter death. 



MINOTAUR 



W HEN Jake Lundberg fi- 
nally broke his way 
through the inner door of the 
airlock into the Prosper 
Prince, he found himself in 
pitch darkness. 

“ That’s not going to work,” 
he said, and went back along 
the line of the small magnetic 
grapple that held the two 
ships together and into his 
own Molly B. 

The Molly B., a range scout, 
while large enough and com- 
fortable enough by the ordi- 
nary standards of a Govern- 
ment trouble-shooter, was at 
the moment looking rather 
minnowlike and feeling rather 
cramped, at the end of the 

52 



fragile little line that was 
all that was required to keep 
the two vessels together in the 
absence of gravity. For the 
Prosper Prince had been a 
full-scale survey ship, with its 
own labs and shops and a 
crew of nine. 

“What could happen to 
nine trained men twelve light- 
years from the nearest star?” 
said Jake, who was used to 
talking out loud for the bene- 
fit of the little throat micro- 
phone that connected him 
with the recorder on the Mol- 
ly B., no matter how far he 
might wander from her. “You 
tell me.” 

Molly B. made no effort to 





tell him. She was agreeable 
but dumb, in the literal sense 
of that word. 

“Now I’m getting self-pow- 
ered lights which I’ll carry- 
over and string out along the 
corridor to the control room 
there as I go,” Jake added, for 
the recorder, as he dug into a 
supply locker. “Don’t get 
lonely now, Molly.” 

He went back out and along 
the line into the Prosper 
Prince once more, moving a 
little awkwardly, for if the 
lights he was carrying 
weighed nothing, in the ab- 
sence of gravity, they made a 
pretty full armload. 

Through the airlock into the 



Prosper Prince proper, Jake 
encountered a small amount 
of weight. About one-half 
G. Which meant that al- 
though the lights were not 
functioning, the ship he was 
in was not completely dead. 
The air, however, though his 
helmet counter showed it as 
good, smelled musty when he 
flipped the helmet back. 
Whatever else was operating, 
the circulating fans were off. 

L OADED, with his lights on, 
i Jake headed down the 
main corridor in what he 
knew must be the route to the 
control area forward. Every 
forty feet or so, or at each 



MINOTAUR 



53 



bend in the corridor, he 
stopped to set one of the lights 
in place against the corridor 
wall. The magnetic base of 
each light stuck firmly, and 
its lens, with a theoretical 
thousand years of power self- 
contained behind it, began to 
flood the corridor with light 
as soon as it made contact 
with the wall. The main cor.- 
ridor, Jake noted as he went 
along, was comparable to the 
air in the ship. It looked all 
right, but it gave evidence of 
having been unused for some 
time. 

A hundred yards down the 
corridor and up an emergency 
ladder (the lift tube was, of 
course, not working) and 
along the corridor above for 
another twenty yards brought 
Jake to the door of the main 
control center of the ship. He 
stepped inside, fixed one of 
his lights to a handy wall and 
put down the rest of his load 
while he looked the situation 
over. 

The control center — ex- 
cept for the faintly musty 
odor of the air and the slight 
film of dust — might have 
been abandoned just a mo- 
ment or so before. All the 
equipment was in workable- 
looking shape. The one excep- 
tion was the coffee and water 
taps in a little alcove off the 
plotting board. These had 
been battered into the wall 
from which they protruded, as 
if by a sledge-hammer. 

“Now what do you think of 

54 



that?” said Jake, and pro- 
ceeded to detail the situation 
for the benefit of the recorder 
back on the Moll b B. He could 
imagine one of the think- 
boys back at Earth Headquar- 
ters, six months from now, 
pausing as this part of the 
tape was played back, and 
scratching his head. 

“Don’t let it get you down, 
Pete,” he said. Jake called all 
the think-boys Pete. Head- 
quarters had sent him several 
stiff memos about it. He paid 
no attention. He had to risk 
his neck as an occasional part 
of his job. They didn’t. If 
they didn’t like the way he 
made his reports, they knew 
exactly what they could do 
about it. 

Jake moved over to the log 
desk, passing the main screen 
as he did so. The screen was 
dead, its silvery surface re- 
flecting a picture of the con- 
trol room and himself. He 
paused to inspect the two V- 
shaped inroads of scalp into 
his hairline. Yes, they were 
definitely going back. There 
was no use blinking the fact. 
And that was no good. All 
right, perhaps, for some skin- 
ny intellectual type to have a 
high forehead, but a broad, 
square- jawed character like 
himself — he just looked half- 
shorn. He’d probably better 
see about repilation, next trip 
home to Earth. 

“ — or else a good hair ton- 
ic,” he said out aloud. “Make 
a note of that, Pete.” 

GORDON R. DICKSON 




T HE logbook was also 
turned off. But when he 
flipped the switch, it lit up in 
proper shape. He ran the tape 
back to the last entry. 

June 34, 2462: Still on 
twelfth jump between Run- 
yon’s World and Ceta. Bio- 
chemist Walter Latham, 
slight case of hives. Taking 
infra-red treatments. Acid 
condition of soil in grass 
plantation tank of air-fresh- 
ener room corrected. The cof- 
fee continues to have a burned 
taste. No evidence of spoilage, 
but suggest Quartermaster 
look into this on return to 
Earth. Today was the nine- 
teenth anniversary of the 
launching of this ship, and the 
event was duly celebrated by 
the crew and staff at a dinner 
at which an original poem 
written in honor of the occa- 
sion by Engineer’s Assistant 
Rory Katchuk was recited 
and, by unanimous vote of the 
whole crew, ordered to be 
written into the ship’s log. It 
is as follows: 

Oh, Prosper Prince 
You made me wince, 
Right from the start, 
And ever since. 

Some more of the corridor 
lights have been smashed 
about the ship. If this is one 
of the elaborate practical 
jokes that sometimes crop up 
on long voyages, it is in bad 
taste, and the man respon- 
sible, when found, will be 
severely dealt with. This ap- 
plies also to whoever is re- 



sponsible for the sobbing 
noise. 

Jake raised bushy eyebrows 
upward into the growingly 
naked scalp he had just been 
examining. He read off the en- 
try in the log for Pete’s bene- 
fit. 

“Sobbing noise?” he' ech- 
oed. “Now, that’s a new one. 
Let’s look a little farther 
back.” 

He spun the tape back at 
random and stopped it. He 
read off the entry before him 
out loud. 

“April 29, 2462: Due to lift 
from Runyon’s World tomor- 
row. All reports complete and 
planet looks good. The Pros-

selection. ( See Jeffers-Brad- 
ley report #297, log inclusion 
Jan. 8, 2462.)” 

J AKE spun the log back to 
January the third of that 
year and discovered the report 
inclusion. 

“We found the forest to con- 
sist of vegetation similar to 
our hardwood forests — oak- 
like trees with many small 
branches and twigs, but no 
leaves. The twigs, however, 
are so numerous and thick 
that sunlight is cut to a mini- 
mum, there is almost no 
ground-cover or small vegeta- 
tion between the trees but a 
sort of moss, and no animal 
life to be seen, except an oc- 
casional firefly kind of insect. 
Phosphorescence noticeable in 
darker spots coating tree 
trunks and even the ground, 
due to a fungoid life-form 
which excretes a zinc-sulphate 
phosphor.” 

Jake spun the log ahead to 
April 29th and finished read- 
ing the entry there. 

“A possible clue may lie in 
the fact that these creatures 
avoid the streaks of zinc-sul- 
phate phosphors which make 
their appearance mysterious- 
ly at night even in the open 
meadows. At any rate, this is 
a puzzle for later investiga- 
tion, if the planet is opened 
for colonization." 

Jake shut off the log, 
thoughtfully. 

“Well, Pete,” he said, “what 
do you think of that? They 

56 



lifted for home on April 30th. 
By July they were posted 
overdue. I was sent out to look 
for them July 10th and it’s 
only taken me 40 days to find 
them. They’re right where 
they should be if they’d just 
quit jumping on the 12th 
jump. No sign of trouble — 
except those coffee and water 
taps over there. But no sign of 
anybody aboard either. You 
don’t suppose they just all de- 
cided to walk right out of the 
airlock?” 

There was no answer to 
that question, of course, so 
Jake shook his head, gathered 
up his armload of lights and 
went on exploring and distrib- 
uting illumination about the 
Prosper Prince. 

He found the ship in good 
shape, but empty. The control 
section was empty, the offi- 
cer’s quarters were empty, the 
recreation areas were empty, 
and the men’s quarters were 
empty. 

Going down one level, he 
found himself in the section 
reserved for the labs and 
shops — and it was here that 
he reached the end of his sup- 
ply of lights. Taking the last 
one and hand-activating it, 
he proceeded, carrying it like 
a searchlamp before him, and 
began to work back aft to- 
ward the greenery, where the 
grass plantation tank that re- 
newed the oxygen supply in 
the ship had its existence, 
with water reservoir, and the 
drive units. 



GORDON R. DICKSON 




HEN he stepped through 
the door into the green- 
ery, at first sight it looked as 
a greenery should. It was a 
large, almost empty-seeming 
room with the equivalent of 
two city lots planted in a very 
tall grass which looked total- 
ly undisturbed. But at one 
end, where the ventilating 
system was, the fan housing 
had been completely wrecked 
and the fan inside it smashed. 

“Aha!” said Jake to his 
mike. “Somebody decided to 
dispose of the ventilating sys- 
tem, Pete. Suppose we just 
take a closer look at that.” He 
moved forward toward the 
fan housing. 

But before he could reach 
it, noise exploded upon his ear- 
drums. It was distant but 
thunderous noise, coming 
from the front end of the 
ship, a racket like a gang of 
medieval smiths working on 
armor. 

Jake spun about and burst 
out of the room. He ran back 
up the corridor. As he neared 
the noise, it echoed and re- 
echoed through the metal 
walls about him. 

He scrambled up the ladder 
to the mid-level of the ship 
and just as he reached the 
top, the noise stopped. He 
stopped, too. In the new and 
sudden silence, he could hear 
his own heart pounding. 

He stood listening : then he 
went forward again. He 
moved down the mid-level cor- 
ridor, the one he had first en- 



tered on coming into the ship. 
But he saw nothing amiss un- 
til he rounded the curve to the 
point where the airlock 
pierced the inner and outer 
skins of the vessel. The mas- 
sive latch handle, which 
dogged shut the inner door to 
the lock, had been battered 
completely off. 

For a long moment, Jake 
said nothing. Then he cleared 
his throat, but not noisily. 

“Are you still there, Pete?” 
he half-whispered. There was 
no answer, of course, but the 
sound of his own voice shocked 
a little common sense back in- 
to him. 

He looked up and down the 
corridor. The lights still 
burned, undisturbed. 

“Pete,” he said fervently, 
“there’s something aboard 
here and it doesn’t love me.” 

He looked again at the door. 
Damaged as it was, there was 
no hope of his opening it — 
not, at least, without tools. 
For a second he felt a com- 
pletely irrational flash of 
rage. There was the Molly B. 
out there, a fgw feet from 
him, with the very tools he 
needed to break through to get 
to her. And for lack of the 
tools, he could not do so. 

He suddenly reminded him- 
self there should be tools 
aboard this ship as well. It 
was only a matter of finding 
them. He turned about and 
headed once more toward the 
control room. In there, there 
should be a master chart of 




MINOTAUR 



57 




the vessel and a list of the 
supplies and equipment she 
would have been carrying. 

B ACK in the control room, 
Jake found his normal 
good spirits recovering. After 
all, he considered, it was only 
a matter of taking the time to 
locate tools on board this ship. 
Then he could break open the 
door and slap a tow-line from 
the Molly B. onto this ship 
and haul her to Earth, where 
whatever was aboard could 
be captured by properly armed 
and protected men. He even 
whistled a bit as he thought 
of it. 

His whistling ended abrupt- 
ly a few moments later. He 
had located the design chart, 
the equipment list and the 
arms locker. The arms locker, 
however, was locked. And 
Jake had discovered that the 
combination to it was missing 
from the papers in his hand. 

“Oh-oh,” said Jake. “I don't 
like this, Pete. I don’t like it 
at all.” 

He reached for the locker 
door nonetheless, — and ab- 
ruptly he felt a crawling sen- 
sation on the back of his neck. 
He whirled about. But the con- 
trol room was empty. The en- 
trance to it was empty. And 
as far as he could see, down 
the corridor beyond it, that 
too was empty. 

“Nerves,” he told himself 
and Pete, out loud. “Nerves.” 
Suddenly, the light halfway 
down the corridor and out of 

58 



sight of the doorway, from 
where Jake was then stand- 
ing, went out. And there was 
a tinkling smash in the dark- 
ness. 

Jake froze. And then the 
hair on the back of his neck 
began to rise. For, eerily, 
from the darkened corridor, 
there came to his ears the 
sound of a sobbing. A sobbing 
like that of a soul whose last 
hope had been stolen and lpst 
forever. 

Jake backed up against the 
drive control. His hand, grop- 
ing instinctively behind him 
for some sort of weapon, 
closed about the short metal 
length of the captain’s wire- 
less microphone. He grabbed 
it up in one hand, an eight- 
inch club weighing maybe 
four pounds. 

And the sobbing stopped. 
It stopped as short as if the 
sobber had had his breath 
choked off. Still bristling, Jake 
circled quietly about the room 
and approached the door, sid- 
ling along the wall. As he 
passed the wall of the control 
room he detached the lamp he 
had put against the wall 
there; and, hand-activating it 
to keep on burning, he carried 
it with him. When he reached 
the doorway, he swung sud- 
denly into it and flashed its 
beam down the full long cor- 
ridor. 

The corridor was absolute- 
ly empty. 

Jake stood there in baffled 
frustration. Then he turned 



GORDON R. DICKSON 




and went back to the arms 
locker. He tried to batter it 
open, using the captain’s mi- 
crophone. He managed to bend 
the microphone, but he did not 
manage to open the door. 

“Pete,” he said softly put- 
ting the bent microphone 
down, “this is a heck of a sit- 
uation. You heard that bang- 
ing before, and you heard the 
sobbing this time. Tell me, 
Pete, what sort of something 
would want to make noises 
like that?” 

H E shook his head tensely 
and went back to the list. 
On it, he located the section 
that dealt with tools. The 
tools he would want, he dis- 
covered, were down in the tool 
shop on the lower level again, 
back by the greenery. Jake 
whistled tunelessly through 
his teeth as he read this little 
item of information. 

“It would, be out there !” he 
said. “Well, Pete, here we go 
down to the bottom level of 
the ship again. Down to the 
tool room to get ourselves a 
cutter torch and pry bar.” 
He took the lamp from the 
control room wall and placed 
it so it would catch part of 
the corridor as well as the 
control room. Then, picking 
up the light he had been carry- 
ing as a hand lamp, he head- 
ed back for the bottom level. 
He went off down the corri- 
dor, and when he reached the 
point where the other light 
had been, he stopped. 

MINOTAUR 



The light that had -been 
there was lying on the floor of 
the corridor. It had been thor- 
oughly smashed. 

Jake puzzled over the re- 
mains, found no answer, and 
continued on to the ladder, 
careful to keep the light ahead 
of him. A little farther on, 
however, he moved into the 
area of another light, which 
was shining brightly, intact. 
He hooked his own light onto 
his belt. Then he went on un- 
til he came to the ladder lead- 
ing both up and down, and 
climbed down it to the lower 
level once more. 

He went along the lower lev- 
el corridor to the greenery. 
He paused warily to glance in, 
but the room was empty. He 
continued on to where the cor- 
ridor ended in a door. Open- 
ing this door, he stepped 
through into the tool shop of 
the ship. He was in a mod- 
erately sized square room, 
about twice the size of an or- 
dinary earthside kitchen. A 
number of power tools stood 
around the wall and magnetic 
racks were fitted with hand 
tools. 

He selected a portable torch 
flame cutter and a spring- 
operated pry bar. Then he 
came back out of the tool room 
into the lower level corridor. 
He started his walk back up 
the corridor toward the lad- 
der. As he went he found him- 
self wishing that he had been 
able to bring a second load of 
lights before he had been 

59 




made a prisoner aboard this 
vessel. The lamp at his belt 
flung a brilliant glare before 
him. It was more than ade- 
quate to the subjects it illu- 
minated. Nevertheless, dark- 
ness followed; and shadows 
jumped and slid along the 
walls as he walked. He had 
just reached the foot of the 
ladder when a sound reached 
his ears. 

It was the sound of a light 
somewhere distant in the ship, 
smashing. 

He stopped with his hands 
on the ladder. He found him- 
self straining his ears to lis- 
ten. But there was no other 
sound. He climbed up the lad- 
der, went down the corridor a 
little way and came to the 
inner airlock door. He chose a 
spot along the corridor wall 
where the light would illumi- 
nate the door well, without 
shadows; and at this spot, 
some ten feet from him, he 
clamped the light to the wall 
and raised the torch to go to 
work on the door. 

Once more, somewhere dis- 
tant in the ship, a light 
smashed and tinkled. 

J AKE shut his jaw a little 
grimly and turned to the 
inner door of the airlock. The 
flame from the cutting torch 
in his hand splattered against 
the metal. 

It was some moments before 
Jake realized that it was hav- 
ing little or no effect. 

He stopped and checked, 

60 



first the torch, then the door. 
The torch was in perfectly 
good shape. The door, how- 
ever, carried in its lower right 
corner a little legend stamped 
into the metal. The legend 
consisted of a small “c” with 
a circle around it. 

Jake straightened up, 
breathed deeply, and ran his 
thick fingers slowly through 
his close-cropped hair. 

“Well, Pete,” he said, his 
voice sounding odd in his own 
ears, “how do you like that? 
They would decide to make 
their airlock out of collapsed 
steel instead of something cut- 
table.” 

He glanced once more at the 
torch, hanging useless in his 
hand, and stuck the tool back 
into his belt. There was noth- 
ing that would get him 
through the collapsed steel of 
the airlock he faced now, he 
knew, but some of the special 
equipment he had on board 
the Molly B. 

“O.K., Pete,” he said softly. 
“Mohammed and the moun- 
tain, all over again. If I can’t 
tow this ship home with the 
Molly B., maybe I can tow the 
Molly B. home with this ship.” 

He turned away and headed 
up the corridor toward the 
control room. 

Some time later, with the 
door to the control room closed 
and welded shut with the 
torch at his belt against in- 
terruption, Jake was busy 
overhauling the controls. As 
far as he could see, they were 

GORDON R. DICKSON 




in excellent shape. He had 
nothing to do now but simply 
start the vessel moving and 
keep it at it. 

However, handling a ship 
this size was not simple at all. 
It was not so much the ques- 
tion of driving as it was of 
figuring where to. The process 
by which an interstellar ship 
moved in space was by mak- 
ing large “shifts.” These 
shifts instantly caused the 
vessel to cease to be at one 
particular point in time and 
space and caused it to be at 
another point in space. There 
was literally no effort to it. 

The calculations required to 
tell the person running the 
ship where he was and where 
he would be once he shifted, 
though, were very complicat- 
ed indeed. In this instance, it 
was further complicated by 
the fact that Jake had to stop 
and figure out all over again 
where he was. That informa- 
tion was on board the Molly 
B. But, since the Molly B. was 
out of reach, Jake theoretical- 
ly had to go back to Earth 
and retrace his steps all the 
way out to this point. Of 
course he had the great calcu- 
lators of the ship here to do it 
with. But still, it was a time- 
consuming job. 

I T TOOK two hours to get 
the ship in working condi- 
tion. It took three more hours 
to find out where he was. 
Nearly six hours had gone 
by since Jake had entered the 

MINOTAUR 



ship ; and when he was finally 
done, he found himself tired, 
hungry and thirsty. But the 
shifts were programmed that 
would take the ship to Earth. 

He started the Prosper 
Prince toward its first shift 
point, and then cautiously he 
cut open the door to the con- 
trol room and looked out down 
the corridor. He saw utter 
darkness. No lamp, no light 
was showing anywhere. 
Through his teeth he whistled 
two short bars of a tune. 
Then he took down one of the 
two lamps that yet remained 
in the control room, the one 
he had carried in his belt; and 
taking this with him, hold- 
ing it before him, he lit it and 
walked down the corridor. 

He saw nothing as he went, 
although the sound of his own 
footfalls were loud in his ear. 
Halfway down the length of 
the ship, past the officers’ 
quarters, he came to the ship’s 
galley. Closing this door, he 
made welds at its four corn- 
ers and set about preparing 
himself something to eat and 
drink. 

It was not that he expected 
his welds would secure the 
door against whatever had 
had strength enough to smash 
the water and coffee taps in 
the control room, or dismem- 
ber the blower equipment in 
the greenery ; but he hoped its 
having to break through the 
door would give him time to 
adopt a posture of defense. 
And the cutting torch in his 

61 




Tiand would be a weapon of 
sorts. 

He made himself a pretty 
fair meal out of dehydrated 
stores, and a pot of coffee. Aft- 
er he had eaten, he sat at the 
galley table, with one eye on 
the welded-shut door, drink- 
ing the coffee. The ship’s log- 
book hadn’t lied ; the coffee did 
have a burned taste. He men- 
tioned this to Pete in passing. 

Then his mind switched off 
onto speculation as to what it 
might be that roamed the ship 
and had evidently disposed of 
its original crew. He had a 
long talk with Pete about the 
matter, exploring several like- 
ly possibilities, but coming 
back to the pretty obvious 
conclusion that it must have 
been a life-form common to 
the Runyon’s World that had 
somehow got on board. 

“But how,’’ Jake said, 
“something that large and 
dangerous could get on a ship 
like this without being seen 
or known about, I can’t un- 
derstand.” 

A sudden thought hit him. 
He cleaned up the remains of 
his meal, cut open the door 
and went back up to the con- 
trol room. Sealing himself 
in there, he went to check the 
ship’s records once more. 

T HIS TIME, in a different 
record section, he found a 
small list of livestock taken 
from the planet. This ranged 
from sub-microscopic life- 
forms, strain of the phosphor- 

62 



escent bacteria, and on up to 
one of the Goopers mentioned 
in the log and in the report he 
had read earlier. The record 
also told him where these were 
to be found — in the ship’s or- 
ganic laboratory on the top 
level. Jake put the record 
away thoughtfully. 

He checked to see that the 
ship was properly approach- 
ing the point for its first shift 
through no-space, then took 
his torch and lamp, and un- 
sealed the control room. He 
went down the corridor and 
up to the top level of the ship. 
A few doorways down the cor- 
ridor of the top level, he dis- 
covered the entrance to the 
ship’s organic laboratory. 

The door was ajar. He 
stepped inside without touch- 
ing it. The laboratory was a 
pretty large room, three-quar- 
ters of which were given over 
to chemical equipment and 
supplies, and one-quarter of 
which was equipped with cag- 
es and containers. Jake saw 
at a glance that all the cages 
and containers had been bro- 
ken open, except the largest of 
them — a cage which might 
possibly have contained some- 
thing the size of an adult 
chimpanzee. 

Almost against his will, 
Jake felt a slightly sickening 
shiver run down his spine. It 
occurred to him that some- 
thing had been in here with 
an appetite, and for the first 
time, he had a mental image 
ot what might have happened 

GORDON R. DICKSON 








to the original crew of the 
vessel. 

He leaned over to examine 
the cage from which two bars 
had been wrenched out, in the 
light of his lamp which he had 
set against the wall just in- 
side the door. He put his hands 
on two of the bars and felt 
them turn in his grasp. He 
took his hands away and 
stared. The bars appeared 
solid, but they had been twist- 
ed loose in their sockets. He 
twisted one again and it came 
neatly out in his hand, being 
loose at the top and broken 
off at the bottom. He put it 
back — and suddenly, without 
warning, there was a smash- 
ing sound ; and he was plunged 
into total darkness. 

Jake whirled, the torch 
which was in his hand coming 
up automatically. There was 
a sound of movement in the 
direction of the doorway. A 
strange and undefinable odor 
smote his nostrils. He sensed 
rather than saw a large body 
leaping at him and triggered 
the torch. 

Its flame lashed out for a 
fractionary moment; then the 
torch was knocked from his 
hand. In that split second of 
light, he saw something hulk- 
ing and vaguely manlike, but 
larger than any man had a 
right to be. Then he saw no 
more, because the torch was 
gone from his hand a,nd au- 
tomatically shut off. But a 
hideous howl rang through 
the room. There was a smash- 



MINOTAUR 



63 




ing noise from the direction 
of the doorway. Then the howl 
rose again, out in the corridor, 
and there was a sound of run- 
ning. For a third time he 
heard the howl, distant half 
the ship’s length from him, 
but hideous as ever. Then 
there was silence. 

D OWN on hands and knees, 
with frantically search- 
ing fingers, Jake pawed about 
for the torch. He found it and 
pressed its trigger. By the 
lurid gleam of its flame he 
saw the light he had put 
against the wall, lying 
smashed on the floor. 

Jake drew in a shaky 
breath. 

“Well, Pete,” he whispered 
with a dry throat. “Here we 
are in the dark with just a 
cutting torch. And whatever 
it is isn’t feeling too happy 
right about this moment.” He 
got to his feet in the darkness. 
“I’ll try to make it back to 
the control room,” he said, 
“using the torch here to light 
me.” 

Cautiously, keeping the 
torch triggered, Jake moved 
out into the corridor. The 
flame it threw was not an ef- 
fective light. It illuminated 
poorly and glared in his eyes 
at the same time. Half-blind- 
ed, and half-smothered in 
darkness, Jake found the lad- 
der and fumbled his way 
down it to the main level. Still 
holding the torch, he headed 
back to the control room. 

64 



At that moment the first of 
the shifts hit him. He was con- 
scious of the peculiar fleeting 
moment of nausea that 
marked one of the great jumps 
in space. It was disturbing, 
coming when his nerves were 
wire-tense, but it was also re- 
assuring. The ship, he knew, 
was headed home. 

He had paused when the 
shift hit him. Now, as he 
started forward again, the 
torch in his hand sputtered 
and went out. For a second, 
he stood paralyzed in the 
dark. Then the torch flamed 
on once more. 

Instantly, he realized what 
was happening. The torch 
was nearing the end of its 
charge and it was the only 
weapon he had — and the tool 
room from which it had come 
was clear across the ship 
away from him. 

Hastily, he shut it off. Black- 
ness rushed in around him. 
Utter blackness. He strained 
his eyes in both directions up 
and down the main level cor- 
ridor, but there was not the 
faintest glimmer of light. It 
came to him then that all the 
lights he had set up must have 
been found and smashed. He 
was alone, in the dark, with 
whatever was prowling the 
ship. 

He reached out to touch the 
wall with his fingertips for 
guidance. And as he did so, he 
became aware for the first 
time of a faint glow. His eyes 
were adjusting to a level of 

GORDON R. DICKSON 




illumination just barely above 
the level of darkness. He stood 
still, letting his vision con- 
tinue to adjust. 

Gradually there emerged 
the eeriness of long streaks of 
phosphorescence, glowing on 
the walls of the ship. By their 
total shape, he was able to 
make out the directions and 
the dimensions of the corridor 
in both directions. His breath 
caught in his throat in relief. 

“How do you like that?” 
he whispered. “Looks like 
Runyon’s World can be use- 
ful, too.” 

UE BEGAN to feel his way 
Al down the corridor toward 
the control room. He was, he 
estimated, about halfway 
there when an indescribable 
uneasiness caused him to hesi- 
tate. He halted. He stood stone 
still in the darkness, his eyes 
staring ahead. 

Then he saw what instinct 
had warned him of — one of 
the streaks of phosphores- 
ence down by the entrance to 
the control room was slowly 
being occluded by something 
large and black, thirty feet or 
so from him. 

In sheer reflex his finger 
tightened on the trigger of the 
torch. Blue flame spurted 
blindingly from the torch’s 
muzzle. And although the dis- 
tance was far too great for 
the flame to have done any 
damage, the animal howl of 
hate and terror and pain he 
had hear before rang out. 

MINOTAUR 



Jake whirled about and ran 
stumblingly back the way he 
had come. 

He paused, finally, and 
leaned against the wall to 
catch his breath. Looking 
back along the corridor he 
saw the streaks of phosphor- 
escence clear and uneclipsed. 
The creature, whatever it was, 
must have fled in the opposite 
direction. 

His mind racing, Jake 
reached out one finger and 
touched the streak of phos- 
phorescence close behind him, 
realizing suddenly that as he 
had seen the monster obscur- 
ing the phosphorescence, so 
the monster had also seen him. 
A little of the shining stuff 
came away on his finger, 
which glowed ghostlike before 
him. A wild thought leaped 
and hammered in his brain. 

He turned about once again 
with his back to the control 
room and began to work his 
way toward the clinic. He 
found the entrance to it and 
slipped inside. Easing the 
door closed behind him, he 
risked the fading power of 
the torch in one brief sputter 
of light. Immediately it was 
dark again, but as blackness 
washed in, his hand closed 
around the stem of the infra- 
red lamp that had been used 
in treating the crewman with 
hives he had read about in the 
log. Lamp and torch in hand, 
he stepped back out into the 
corridor. 

“The phosphorescence is 

65 




something that works for it, 
Pete,” he whispered. “Let’s 
see how it likes this!” 

He switched on the lamp 
and began moving down the 
corridor. At one spot along 
its length he shut it off and 
paused to look back. What he 
saw then made him smile in 
the darkness with satisfac- 
tion. 

T EN DAYS later, a survey 
ship and the Molly B. were 
taken in tow just outside 
Earth’s orbit. Aboard was 
found a very large baboonlike 
creature, somewhat burned 
about the upper arms or fore- 
limbs but quite alive, although 
huddled in the welded-shut 
greenery, from which the 
creature had to be drugged 
before it could be removed. 
And a very much alive and 
self-possessed Jake. 

“The thing is, Pete,” ex- 
plained Jake cheerfully later 
to Albin Rhinehart, a fat, 
hard-faced man who was Di- 
rector of the Investigatory 
Bureau, “the vegetarian 
Goopers the crew got ac- 
quainted with on the planet 
were simply a pre-form, from 
which emerged an occasional 
black sheep, possibly mutant 
variety, which took to carniv- 
orous ways and acted as a 
natural control by preying on 
its own species. The mutants 
grew much larger and nor- 
mally hid out in the forest 
areas. The forest areas that 
were lighted at night by this 

66 



fungoid which produced a 
marked zinc - sulphate phos- 
phorescence.” 

“But — ” began Albin. 

“Let me tell it my way, 
Pete,” went on Jake, perching 
on the corner of the desk and 
wiping his forehead. His fin- 
gers explored his hairline for 
an absent-minded second. 
“You don’t happen to know 
any good repilators, do you? 
. No, I didn’t think so. 
Well, to get on with it, these 
large, carnivorous, mutant 
Goopers preyed on the vegeta- 
rians. Evidently the crew of 
the ship took aboard one of the 
vegetarian variety, not know- 
ing he was also a mutant pre- 
form. The change came about, 
or perhaps something during 
the trip triggered it, and the 
Gooper grew large and es- 
caped. One night it started 
preying on the crew in the 
darkness.” Pete’s face became 
grim. “I found some of their 
bones, as well as some of the 
bones of the lesser laboratory 
animals. These mutant forms 
are evidently pretty intelli- 
gent.” 

“What makes you think 
that?” said Albin. 

“Well,” answered Jake, 
“judging from the reports of 
smashed lights and sobbing 
noises, this one had been out 
of his cage and back in again 
several times before he ran 
wild. Otherwise there would 
have been a report in the log 
to the effect that he had bro- 
ken out. Remember those two 



GORDON R. DICKSON 




bars that looked all right but 
were actually broken loose?” 
“Then what did happen, do 
you think?” Albin asked. 

"T THINK,” said Jake, “that 
A the Gooper, following his 
instincts as well as his in- 
telligence, went out first to 
spread phosphorescent fun- 
gus around the ship, then re- 
turned to his cage. Or he may 
have done it in several trips. 
Then one night, or at some 
particular time when most of 
the men were separated or 
asleep, it smashed all the 
lights, then hunted them 
down and killed them one by 
one. I found where one man 
had tried to hide in the venti- 
lating blower, down in the 
greenery, and I suspect an- 
other must have been getting 
himself a cup of coffee when 
he was attacked.” 

“Biology reports the crea- 
ture’s eyes are particularly 
adapted to seeing under the 
conditions of this phosphores- 
cence,” commented Albin. 

“It figures,” said Jake. “It 
probably lived off the men it 
killed for a couple of weeks at 
least, and after that polished 
off the laboratory animals. 
But it was evidently pretty 
well starving by the time I 
came aboard, judging by all 
the loose skin about it.” 

“That fungoid phosphores- 



cence is interesting,” said Al- 
bin. “Evidently it fostered 
cultures in the forearm 
glands, which were active in 
the carnivorous beast, and 
which it distributed by rub- 
bing the glands over surfaces 
it passed.” 

“A form of symbiosis, may- 
be,” suggested Jake. He 
yawned and stretched. 

“Well,” said Albin, staring 
at him, “you seemed to have 
come out all right. How come 
the phosphorescence didn’t 
help it get you?” 

“That infra-red lamp I told 
you about, remember?” re- 
plied Jake, grinning. 

Albin did not grin back. “I 
don’t get it.” 

“Red light quenches phos- 
phorescence. In the dark, the 
beast, for all its size, was more 
afraid of me than I was of it. 
It’d already had a taste of the 
cutting torch and it couldn’t 
know I was about out of fuel. 
I herded it into the greenery 
and sealed it there.” Jake 
cocked an eye at Albin. “But 
I’m surprised at you, not 
knowing that little fact about 
phosphorescence and red 
light, a man in your position. 
Maybe you ought to take a 
few night study courses, 
Pete.” 

“The name’s not Pete,” said 
Albin stiffly.

M ENTION a theory of con- 
tinuous creation and 
most people will think of Fred 
Hoyle and astronomy. How- 
ever, Dr. Sidney W. Fox of 
Florida State University 
makes the intriguing sugges- 
tion that even now life may be 
beginning anew. In a sweep- 
ing study of the nature of 
life, ranging from Darwin to 
current attempts to produce a 
living cell synthetically, Dr. 
Fox says that there is “in- 
creasing reason to believe that 
life can, or even must, arise 
in many places at many 
times.” He suggests that we 



may have observed many spe- 
cimens of newly formed life 
but failed to recognize them, 
because they so closely re- 
semble unevolved descendants 
of forms already here. 

It may sound like sheer lun- 
acy, but many sticksville 
stories about the Moon seem 
to have something in them. It 
has been believed since farm- 
ers plowed with a pointed 
stick that planting was best 
at certain phases of the moon, 
the general idea being that 
what grows while the moon 
grows will grow best. Under 



68 



SCIENCE BRIEFS 






the waning moon, grain was 
cut, sheep sheared, manure 
spread, and eggs were put un- 
der hens. Under the waning 
moon you’d sow seeds, so they 
would sprout and grow with 
the moon. Now Dr. Rudolph 
Steiner reports that corn 
planted two days before the 
full moon was many times 
more productive than corn 
planted two days later. And 
in Canada, farmers report 
that their com yield is a third 
greater when they plant at 
this time. And orehardists in 
England believe that apples 
harvested under the waning 
moon keep better when 
bruised than those picked 
when the moon is waxing. 
Theories, anyone? 

Loran, the remarkable long- 
range navigation system used 
by the Navy and operated by 
the Coast Guard, may emerge 
in a brand-new suit as the 
world’s best satellite tracker. 
At sea, loran users compare 
the time of arrival on ship- 
board of a radio signal re- 
ceived from three ground sta- 
tions. To do this usefully, 
Bureau of Standards scientists 
at Boulder, Colo., have de- 
veloped electronic clocks cap- 
able of slicing a second into 
a million parts. For satellite 
work, one or more transmit- 
ting stations would be added 
to the basic three, to give 3- 
dimensional positioning, and 
then two or more such sys- 
tems may be synchronized to 

SCIENCE BRIEFS 



give positioning within a few 
feet at ranges approaching 
two thousand miles. The new 
system was proposed to the 
NATO Advisory Group for 
Aeronautical Research and 
Development which met re- 
cently at Istanbul, Turkey. 

“The shrewd guess, the fertile 
hypothesis, the courageous 
leap to a tentative conclusion 

— these are the most valuable 
coin of the — ” 

The what? The science-fic- 
tion story, obviously. Har- 
vard’s Prof. J. S. Bruner is, 
however, not talking about 
s-f as he goes on: “ — the 
most valuable coin of the 
thinker at work, whatever his 
line of work.” Prof. Bruner, 
in a new study called “The 
Processes of Education,” is 
plugging for more understand- 
ing arid use of that powerful 
and elusive element of think- 
ing called intuition. He sug- 
gests that students be en- 
couraged to make wild gues- 
ses, great leaps in reasoning. 
Maybe it would train him to 
acquire, control, and develop 
the intuitive ability. “Too 
stringent a penalty on guess- 
ing may restrain thinking of 
any sort,” says Bruner. He 
(rather forcefully) adds, how- 
ever, that though this kind of 
thinking may often produce 
the right answer, it will often 

— perhaps very often — pro- 
duce wrong ones. So the de- 
velopment of intuition re- 
quires a willingness to make 

69 




honest mistakes, and to hold 
still for examination and an- 
alysis of the intuitive solu- 
tion. Says the professor: “One 
who is insecure, who lacks 
confidence in himself, may be 
unwilling to run such risks.” 

You may be aware that “spe- 
cimens” of prehistoric men are 
not usually skeletons at all, 
but a length of thighbone, a 
fragment of jaw, or a couple 
of vertebrae from which care- 
ful scientists deduce, extra- 
polate, reason and construct 
the particular “man.” The dis- 
covery of a whole skeleton, 
then, is an event of major im- 
portance. This happened in 
northern Iraq in 1953, when 
the skeleton of a prehistoric 
infant was found. In 1957 in 
the same place, a cave which 
has apparently been constant- 
ly occupied for the past 100,- 
000 years, three adult skele- 
tons were discovered, and it 
was concluded that they were 
Neanderthalers. And within 
five days recently, three more 
turned up. Examination of 
these seven ancients has yield- 
ed some fascinating evidence. 
One of the adults was the vic- 
tim of arthritis; you can tell 
that to your suffering Aunt 
Suzy. And another had his 
right arm cut off with a stone 
knife in what may have been 
the earliest of all surgical 
operations. Columbia’s Dr. 
Ralph Solecki made the most 
recent find last summer. One 
of the Neanderthalers is now 



in Washington, D.C., in the 
Smithsonian Institution. 

Every mechanical, electrical 
and electronic trouble-shooter 
has at one time or another 
wished that a little light 
would go on down deep in the 
vitals where he is searching. 
For Dr. J. M. Olson of Bran- 
deis, the wish came true in his 
search for more clues in the 
fundamental mystery of pho- 
tosynthesis. Inside living bac- 
teria he discovered that the 
two chemicals that help 
“drive” photosynthesis, DPN 
and TPN, really do light up 
when they are working. The 
bacteria he used are sensitive 
to far-red light in the 8500 
Angstrom unit area, and when 
they are receiving none of 
this red light, the DPN and 
TPN show a weird blue fluor- 
escence. When the red light is 
beamed in, the intensity of 
the fluorescence increases, and 
gradually, after the light is 
out, the brightness of the 
fluorescence fades. Dr. Olson 
is of the opinion that these 
changes indicate when C0 2 is 
being processed into food by 
the enzymes.

One thing the old man was sure of— 
there were far fewer things in heaven 
and earth than were dreamt of in bis 
philosophy — till today. 



YOUNG MAN 

FBOM 

ELSEWHEN 



By SYLVIA JACOBS 



A REDCAP was pushing a 
wheelchair through the 
station, under a ceiling so lof- 
ty that the place seemed emp- 
ty, though hundreds of people 
were milling around, prepar- 
ing to board the early trains. 
The old man in the wheelchair 
had a blanket over his knees, 
in spite of July heat in Los 
Angeles. Beside him walked a 

72 



smartly dressed middle-aged 
woman, slimmed by diet and 
with her steel-gray hair look- 
ing as if she’d just stepped out 
of a beauty parlor. She kept 
up a steady stream of admoni- 
tions. 

“Now, Papa,” she was say- 
ing, “don’t forget to take your 
medicine at lunchtime. Keep 
your chair out of the aisle — 




people have to walk there. 
And whatever you do, don’t 
go to the club car for a drink 
— you know it’s bad for your 
arthritis. The doctor said not 
more than three cigars a day. 
And if Edna isn’t at the sta- 
tion to meet you, just wait, do 
you hear? It’s a long drive 
from her house and she may 
1)0 lclt0 " 

“Heli’s fire!” the old man 
protested. “I was taking 
trains before you were born! 
How my boy Will stands — ” 

He broke off to ogle a Mexi- 
can girl, a ripe sixteen, who 
was walking in the same di- 
rection, ahead of them. 

“Papa! Act your age!” his 
daughter-in-law said under 
her breath. 

“Like they say, a woman’s 
as old as she looks, but a man 
ain’t old till he quits looking,” 
he replied absently. 

The redcap grinned. The lit- 
tle senorita, not knowing who 
was watching her but quite 
sure someone was, paused to 
put a dime in a Coke machine. 
The wheelchair entourage 
passed her and the old man 
craned his neck, looking back- 
ward, determined not to miss 
anything. The girl sat down 
on a bench to drink her Coke. 
If I were only fifty years 
younger, the old man thought, 
I’d buy a Coke, too, and sit 
down beside her . 

“Papa !” his son’s wife 
cried. “You’ll fall out of your 
chair! Why do you always 
have to embarrass me like 



this?” But the insistent voice 
could not interrupt the old 
man’s pleasant daydream of 
conquest. He had turned off 
his hearing aid. 

T HE redcap stopped along- 
side the third car of the 
San-Francisco-bound stream- 
liner and signaled another 
redcap who was unloading a 
baggage truck. The other 
came over to help and two 
pairs of strong young arms 
lifted the old man, wheelchair 
and all, smoothly onto the 
platform of the car. 

His daughter-in-law did 
not board the train. She stood 
waving, calling after the old 
man, “So long, Papa! Have a 
nice visit with Edna and re- 
member what I told you!” 
He waved back automati- 
cally, but he hadn’t heard a 
word she said. He didn’t turn 
his hearing aid back on until 
he had been wheeled inside 
the car. 

Most of the reclining seats 
were already filled. The red- 
cap pushed the wheelchair the 
full length of the aisle and 
parked it in a vacant space 
beyond the last seat,, across 
from the washroom. He 
turned it crosswise, so it 
wouldn’t roll when the train 
started moving, and with its 
occupant facing the window. 

“Turn me around!” the old 
man commanded. “Like to see 
who I’m ridin’ with. If I want 
to look out, I always got the 
opposite window.” 



YOUNG MAN FROM EISEWHEN 



73 




The redcap complied, but 
the old man still wasn’t satis- 
fied. “Better wheel me in the 
club car straight off,” he de- 
cided. 

“Sorry, mister,” the redcap 
said, “but you gotta ride in 
your own car till the conduc- 
tor takes the tickets. Then 
you can have your train por- 
ter take you in there.” That 
wasn’t quite true. The conduc- 
tor could have picked up the 
old man’s ticket in the club 
car, but this way the redcap 
was not personally violating 
the orders of the lady who had 
given him the tip. 

“Take myself in there, long 
as he opens the doors,” the 
old man grumbled. But for 
the time being, he stayed put. 

The train gave just one 
lurch, then picked up speed as 
the straggling city, then trees 
and suburbs and finally fields 
flowed past the opposite win- 
dow. Now the old man felt 
free — for a day, at least, until 
his daughter Edna would take 
over the job supervising his 
every move — but at first the 
trip was lonely. Nobody 
talked to him and the only di- 
version in the car was a baby, 
which started squalling. 

The old man found himself 
thinking how much friendlier 
the atmosphere was in the 
pool hall on Figueroa, where 
he rolled himself almost every 
day when he took his “walk” 
to watch the boys shoot pool. 
He could get there alone from 
his son’s house, for there were 

74 



driveways he could use to 
cross the streets, avoiding 
curbs. He was always wel- 
come in the pool hall and he 
saw to it that he remained 
welcome. Every month, when 
his social security check came, 
he would buy a box of cigars 
and a couple of bottles and 
take them to the pool room, 
where he poured drinks for 
everybody until his money 
was used up. What else was 
money good for but to have a 
good time? 

TTE felt more at home in that 
XI dingy place, with the 
walls covered with . pinups, 
than he did in his son’s mod- 
ern ranch-style house. For all 
his daughter-in-law’s fussing 
over him, her efforts to keep 
him on the diet and the medi- 
cines that were supposed to 
prolong his life, he knew she 
was glad to get rid of him for 
the rest of the summer. He 
knew because he’d heard 
what Jane said to her best 
friend, Sarah Tolliver. Jane 
kept track of him by the 
squeaking of his wheelchair, 
and once he had bought a can 
of oil at the drugstore, and 
oiled the wheels so they didn’t 
make a sound as he rolled up 
the inclined planks Will had 
laid over the kitchen steps. 

Sarah and Jane had been 
in the dining area, having cof- 
fee, and the old man turned 
up his hearing aid so he could 
hear what they were talking 
about from the kitchen. They 

SYLVIA JACOBS 




were talking about him. 

“You don't know how lucky 
you are,” Sarah was saying, 
“that it was his legs gave out 
on him — not his head. When 
I was working at the hospital, 
I saw so many old folks who 
were just zombies, not know- 
ing who they were, where 
they were, or what time it 
was. I tell you, there's noth- 
ing worse than that. But 
Will’s dad? Why, he’s sharp 
as a tack. Nobody puts any- 
thing over on him.” 

“He’s sharp, all right,” 
Jane agreed, “in some ways. 
But if he had the use of his 
legs, he’d be chasing after 
women. And that pool hall he 
hangs out in! When a man 
gets to be seventy-eight, you’d 
think he’d spend his time in 
church, not in a dive like 
that.” 

“What do you care where 
he goes? Sarah asked. “At 
least it gives you some time 
to yourself.” 

That was it. The young 
folks wanted some time to 
themselves. It was only natu- 
ral. Well, Jane would have 
the house to herself, with no 
old man underfoot for the 
next few months, while he 
was at Edna’s. Edna was his 
own flesh and blood ; she 
would mix him a cocktail be- 
fore dinner and serve him 
steaks, not baby food. She 
would kid with him about 
what a Casanova he was be- 
fore her ma domesticated 
him, and light his cigars in- 

rOUNG MAN FROM ELSEWHEN 



stead of hiding the box and 
doling them out one by one. 
She would call him George in- 
stead of Papa, but it would 
only be an act, just to make 
her old father feel good be- 
cause she didn’t expeet him to 
live much longer. For all the 
time it would be understood- 
that he was at John and Ed- 
na’s house for a visit, that the 
place he lived was with Will 
and Jane. The truth was that 
neither of the girls would 
miss him if he didn’t wind up 
at either place. 

But what a way to waste a 
whole golden day he had to 
himself , with neither daugh- 
ter nor daughter-in-law to 
boss or kid him around. He 
had looked forward to this 
day as a day of adventure, a 
day when anything could hap- 
pen, and now he was starting 
it off on the wrong foot, wal- 
lowing in self-pity. What he 
needed was a good stiff drink. 
Yes, at ten o’clock in the 
morning! 

When the conductor took 
his ticket, the old man de- 
manded, “Where in hell is the 
porter?” 

I T was a long train and she 
was hitting ninety now, 
and though you would not 
realize it in the sound-insulat- 
ed, air-conditioned coaches, 
you did when the porter had 
to use his full weight to push 
the door open against the 
wind, when you heard the 
clackety-clack of the wheels 

75 




on the rails, a fountain of 
noise rising up between cars, 
when the wheelchair swayed 
precariously as it was pushed 
across the iron treads over the 
couplings. 

The other coaches were 
filled with bored passengers 
in various stages of somno- 
lence, people to whom the trip 
was merely a means of get- 
ting somewhere else. The club 
car was different; this was 
the gathering-place of those 
to whom the trip was an end 
in itself. It was filled with the 
smell of ginger ale, good whis- 
key and the perfume emanat- 
ing from two young women 
at one of the small tables, pe- 
riodically inspecting their 
makeup and hairdos in little 
mirrors, waiting for some 
nice young men to arrive. 

Regretfully, the old man 
realized that he was not a 
candidate for the honor. But 
a few drinks would dull the 
twinges in his crippled legs 
and make him feel years 
younger. The white-coated 
waiter moved a chair, pulled 
the wheelchair up next to an- 
other small table and placed 
a paper napkin meticulously 
on it. The old man decided to 
start with a bottle of beer. 
Plenty of time to work up to 
the stronger stuff, and this 
way the minimum of pocket 
money his daughter-in-law 
had provided would last long- 
er, perhaps until some free 
spender started buying 
drinks. 

76 



As it turned out, he caught 
his benefactor before the girls 
did. It was a young man of 
perhaps thirty-five, a dead 
ringer for Marshal Wyatt 
Earp. He went directly to the 
old man’s table, as if he had 
picked him out. As a matter 
of fact, he had. 

“May I sit here?” he asked. 
“Glad to have you,” the old 
man said, and meant it. He 
inspected the newcomer care- 
fully. It would be almost too 
good to be true, to meet one 
of those actor fellows on the 
train. No, he decided, the 
clothes weren’t casual enough 
for Hollywood ; they didn’t 
look like southern California 
at all. More the way he im- 
agined an English banker 
would dress. Striped pants, 
cutaway, and a white silk 
scarf knotted at the throat. 
But an Englishman, the old 
man figured, would order ale 
instead of beer, and this one 
simply pointed to the old 
man’s beer bottle when the 
waiter came to take his order. 

“My name’s George Mur- 
ton,” the old man said. “You 
can just call me George.” 
“Yes, indeed,” the stranger 
agreed. “I see we shall get on 
famously. Mine is Sandane.” 
“Anybody ever tell you that 
you look like Wyatt Earp, 
Sandy?” the old man asked. 

“Earp ? I’m afraid I’ve nev- 
er met the gentleman.” 
“Should have known. 
You’re the bookish type. 
Prob’ly never watch televi- 

SYLVIA JACOBS 




sion. Sure don’t talk like a 
Westerner, either. You come 
from California or else- 
where?” 

“I come from elsewhen.” 

O LD George almost choked 
on a swallow of beer. Of 
course! That was why San- 
dane dressed funny, talked 
funny; he’d just stepped out 
of a time machine, like in the 
play last night on Channel 
Two. It all fitted in with the 
old man’s feeling that this 
was a day for adventure. But 
he mustn’t act too surprised ; 
if he did, Sandane would take 
him for one of those old codg- 
ers who think horse-and-bug- 
gy thoughts in the jet age. A 
lot of younger folks, too, 
would say time travel was im- 
possible, the same ones who’d 
called artificial satellites im- 
possible. But George Murton 
had seen so many new devel- 
opments in his lifetime that 
it was not difficult for him to 
accept the idea that this 
young man came from tomor- 
row. 

“How long you plan to be 
here?” he asked casually. “Or 
maybe I should say — how 
long you plan to be here — 
now?” 

"Not long. Just until I can 
get a body.” 

George found that remark 
a little confusing. It didn’t be- 
long in the script about the 
time machine. He felt as if 
he’d switched channels in the 
middle of the first act and 



tuned in on a murder mys- 
tery. 

He leaned across the table 
and said in a low tone, “If 
you’re figurin’ on gettin’ a 
hired gun to kill somebody, 
you’d better not talk about it 
in here. Too public.” 

“On the contrary, it would 
have to be a living body. But 
perhaps you’re right. We 
could talk more freely in my 
compartment. Would you care 
to join me there, George? We 
could have some refreshment 
sent in.” 

“Sure would. Got a lot of 
questions I’d like to ask you. 
You see, I’m the curious type 
and I hang around mostly 
with a bunch of young punks 
that don’t know nothin’ ex- 
cept about the fights and the 
World’s Series. Since my legs 
give out on me, I don’t get 
around much. To tell you the 
truth, this is the first time I 
ever met a fellow from — else- 
when.” 

“Is it really?” Sandane said 
politely. “Well, then, you 
should find it quite interest- 
ing. What shall we have to 
drink?” 

“Bourbon always suits me.” 

“Bourbon? One of the royal 
families ?” 

“Hell, no. You’re in Ameri- 
ca, Sandy, the good old U.S.A. 
We don’t have no royal fami- 
lies. Bourbon is a drink. Whis- 
key, spiritus frumenti, hard 
liquor.” 

“Fine. We shall order two 
flagons of it”

“Comes in fifths and you 
drink it in shot glasses, unless 
you want a mix. Rather have 
mine straight, with a water 
chaser.” 

"My error. I seem to have 
my periods mixed. Suppose 
you order, since you know so 
much more than I about the 
customs of your time?” The 
old man’s happy smile sud- 
denly faded and Sandane ad- 
ded hastily, "I shall pay for 
it, of course. It’s only fitting 
that you should be my guest, 
because I believe you can be a 
great help to me.” 

This time he had hit the 
jackpot, the old man reflected 
as he was wheeled through 
the dining car to the first class 
section of the train, with a 
porter pushing his chair, 
Sandane opening the doors, 
and a bottle of good bourbon 
cradled cozily in his lap. Wait 
till the boys at the pool hall 
heard about this trip! 

T HE first shot of bourbon 
warmed his stomach in the 
good old familiar way, and 
somehow that was confirma- 
tion that the rest of it was 
real, too. 

“How come you talk the 
language so good?” he asked 
his host, after the porter left 
them alone in the compart- 
ment. 

“Is that surprising?” San- 
dane asked. "It shouldn’t be. 
I’m a student of history, in 
your period on a research 
project. Naturally, I would 

78 



have to prepare myself by 
studying the language of the 
country and of the period, in 
order to pass as one of you.” 
“You do real good, Sandy, 
considering. But why do you 
want to act like ordinary 
folks? Seems to me you ought 
to go on TV and tell every- 
body. Bet some big news com- 
mentator would be proud to 
interview you.” 

“Most people of your time 
would consider it a hoax.” 
“Maybe. But as long as you 
told me this much, let’s have 
the rest of it. How does this 
time machine of yours work?” 
“Not a machine, George. A 
capacity of the human mind. 
Dormant in your period, ex- 
cept for rare individuals. 
But in — elsewhen — we have 
learned how to use it. Beyond 
that I can give you no details. 
If I gave them, the method of 
tapping this talent would be 
discovered before it actually 
was. That is why I can’t real- 
ly talk with anyone about it. 
So I can only hint, as I did 
with you. If I encounter skep- 
ticism, I pass it off as a joke. 
This time I was lucky — I 
found someone who would ac- 
cept it on faith. Have an- 
other?” 

“Don’t mind if I do. But it 
strikes me I’m the lucky one.” 
“Perhaps. You could be two 
thousand dollars richer as a 
result of having met me.” 

The old man paused with 
his shot glass halfway to his 
mouth and set it down again.

“Well, now ! I’d be glad to give 
you any information that 
would help you. I seen a lot in 
my life. But two thousand dol- 
lars — ain’t that a mite steep ?” 

“Two thousand, give or take 
twenty — whatever I have left 
when we reach San Francisco. 
Money of this period will be of 
no use to me if we complete 
the transaction, so I may as 
well give you all of it. You 
see, the body I’d like to buy is 
yours.” 

“Hold on, now!” the old 
man exclaimed, propelling his 
chair toward the door of the 
compartment and fumbling 
for the knob. “What am I 
supposed to do with the mon- 
ey if you get my body?” 

“Please don’t be alarmed! 
It would be an exchange. 
You’d get the body I’m using 
and the money besides.” 

“Why in the hell didn’t you 
say so in the first place? For 
trade, Sandy, you wouldn’t 
owe me a dime. But I don’t 
get it. Why should you trade 
a young, healthy body like, 
yours for this old crippled-up 
one? I’d be getting all the best 
of it!” 

“You may not think so 
when I tell you that this body 
I’m using is due to disinte- 
grate into its component ele- 
ments in about two weeks, 
give or take a day or so.” 

“Sandy, you’re just going 
to have to do some explaining. 
I still might take you up on 
the deal, but I got to under- 
stand what I’m getting into.” 

YOUNG MAN FROM ELSEWHEN 



“You have a right to an ex- 
planation. And I can give it to 
you without revealing the ac- 
tual process of the time trans- 
fer. You see, the mind is ca- 
pable of an indefinite number 
of transfers. But a body can 
be used for only one. Before 
we overcame that obstacle, 
we made some serious mis- 

^clkGS 99 

“What happened?” 

"TT was pretty bad during 
1 the experimental trials,” 
said Sandane. “The pioneers, 
who transferred in their own 
bodies, were stuck irrevocably 
in the past. To overcome that, 
some transferred only men- 
tally, which meant they had 
to enter unbidden into a host 
body of the target period. The 
more highly trained mind 
naturally had more strength 
— the host lost his identity. 
What was worse, when the 
visitor transferred back he 
sometimes entered an occu- 
pied body instead of his own. 
When two equally strong 
minds contest for one body 
the result is insanity. And 
worst of all, the former host 
body was left mindless — alive, 
but how shall I say it — ?” 
“Like a zombie?” the old 
man asked. “Somebody who 
don’t know who he is, where 
he is, or what time it is?” 
“Yes, that’s a very good de- 
scription. Of course, this had 
to be stopped.” 

“You didn’t stop it soon 
enough,” the old man said 

79 




dryly. “Must be a lot more of 
you fellows from elsewhen 
around than I figured.” 

“I assure you we don’t do it 
any more. We grow bodies 
for transfer purposes in tanks. 
Like this one, for example.” 

“Well, I do declare,” the 
old man said. “Now, that’s 
what I call progress. Accord- 
ing to that, when your old 
body wears out, you get a new 
one.” 

“We haven’t achieved im- 
mortality yet. The mind has 
its own natural span. It is 
true, however, that we have 
a greater life expectancy, and 
as long as a person lives he 
can have a body of his choice. 
But let’s not get off the sub- 
ject. The point is that I can’t 
transfer back without a body, 
or I might get into one that’s 
occupied. And I can’t take this 
one with me. So I have to have 
one that is — well, if you’ll for- 
give me being so blunt, more 
or less useless to its occupant.” 

“It’s the truth, Sandy, and 
nobody knows it better than 
me. But the part I don’t un- 
derstand is why the body 
you’re using has to fall apart 
in two weeks, if you leave it 
here.” 

“It is actually good for sev- 
eral months after the trans- 
fer. I’ve used up most of the 
time with my researches. But 
as to your question — surely 
you see why we can’t leave a 
lot of displaced bodies clut- 
tering up the past. The few 
pioneers who got stuck in pre- 

80 



vious periods were bad 
enough. They lived longer 
than anyone else of the per- 
iods, but they were taken as 
rare freaks of nature. If this 
happened on a larger scale, it 
would excite comment. Medi- 
cal men would examine these 
people and find certain evolu- 
tionary developments — the 

secret would be out. In order 
to avoid that, the bodies 
grown artificially for trans- 
fer purposes have a built-in 
trigger mechanism. This also 
prevents anyone from over- 
staying his allotted leave. If 
I don’t find a body to trans- 
fer back in within the next 
two weeks, I’ll be dead.” 
“And if you do, I’ll be 
dead,” the old man said. 

“I’m afraid so. Meanwhile, 
though, you’ll have a young, 
healthy body to do with as 
you please, and some money 
to spend. It will happen sud- 
denly; there will be no dis- 
comfort. I thought you looked 
like a man who would appre- 
ciate that. You would be 
cheated out of a decent funer- 
al, however — there will be 
nothing resembling a body 
left to bury.” 

“Funerals !” the old man 
snorted. “Them as got noth- 
ing else to look forward to 
figure on fancy funerals. Me, 
I don’t hanker after anything 
I can’t be around to enjoy.” 
“I’m sorry I can’t offer you 
more than two weeks, give or 
take a day. I was unavoida- 
bly detained.” 



SYLVIA JACOBS 




“Can’t be helped. I ain’t 
likely to get a better offer, so 
I’m taking you up on it. And 
I admire you for an honest 
man. You could just as well of 
told me I’d have two years — 
or twenty. I’ll do the right 
thing by you, too. I won’t let 
out your secret — long as I’m 
sober, that is.” 

T HE young man from else- 
when smiled. “I’m not wor- 
ried about that,” he said, 
“Who would believe your un- 
supported statement?” 

“You got a point there,” 
the old man admitted. “Don’t 
hardly believe it myself, till it 
happens. When do you do this 
switch business?” 

“Just before we reach San 
Francisco, if that suits you.” 
“Suits me fine. But I got a 
daughter, name of Edna Bow- 
ers, meeting me at the station 
there. How you figure on get- 
ting away from her?” 

“It won’t be difficult. I will 
stay with her for a few days ; 
then she simply will not see 
me rolling that chair down 
the block. I will get to the 
transfer point by cab and she 
will turn a report in to the 
police that her father is miss- 
ing. They will, of course, not 
find the missing person.” 
“You mean you can fix it 
so she looks right at my body, 
with you inside it, and don’t 
see anything?” 

“Certainly. I can control 
the mind of anyone of this 
period at will. Anyone of my 



time could do so. It’s easy.” 
“You can? Well, then, why 
in the hell didn’t you? Why 
should you ask me my druth- 
ers when you could take over 
my body whether I liked it or 
not?” 

“That would be highly un- 
ethical.” 

“Sure would. But to save 
your life, seems to me you 
wouldn’t be so squeamish. 
People nowadays would think 
like that, anyway. I can see 
that they’d have to change a 
lot before they could be trust- 
ed with the kind of powers 
you got in elsewhen.” 

“They will,” the young man 
from elsewhen assured him. 
“Human nature is not immu- 
table. But I take it we are 
agreed that we trade bodies 
just before we reach our des- 
tination. Shall we have a 
toast to it?” He filled the old 
man’s shot glass so full it 
sloshed over in the moving 
train. 

“Before we drink to it,” old 
George objected, “hadn’t you 
ought to give me the money 
to bind the bargain?” 

“Why?” his host asked. 
“It’s in my pocket, which will 
be yours when we trade.” 
“That’s right !” the old man 
said. “I get the clothes, too, 
don’t I? Kind of a dignified 
getup. Sure would admire to 
be seen in that! Here’s to 
it!” They clicked glasses and 
downed the drinks. 

“Now, shall we have some 
lunch?” Sandane asked. 



YOUNG MAN FROM ELSEWHEN

“You bet. Say, on the train, 
I’m tempted to order all the 
things that ain’t good for me. 
If I do, my arthritis will be 
giving me hell tomorrow. I’m 
used to that, but as long as 
you’ll be the one to suffer, 
maybe I should stick to my 
diet.” 

“Order what you like. I 
can control the pain for you 
easily enough.” 

“Can you teach me to do 
that?” the old man asked ea- 
gerly. “Wouldn’t want you to 
be giving out any secrets you 
ain’t supposed to, but surely 
that couldn’t do any harm.” 
“It wouldn’t do you any 
good, either,” Sandane re- 
plied. “This body won’t give 
you a bit of trouble as long as 
it lasts. I absolutely guarantee 
that.” 

“Not even a headache the 
morning after?” 

“Not even a headache. Not 
even fatigue.” 

“Think of it! No hangovers 
in elsewhen. Must be a won- 
derful age to live in.” 

“You’d be surprised how 
many people want to get away 
from it,” Sandane remarked. 
“Shall we have something 
sent in or go to the diner?” 
“Let’s go to the diner,” old 
George decided. “I want to 
look over some of the chicks 
on this train. Could be one of 
them is a stranger in San 
Francisco, needs somebody to 
show her the town.” 

“Could be,” Sandane 
agreed. 

82 



A FTER a hearty lunch, 
without a look at the 
right side of the menu, the 
old man started drinking 
again. He kept pleasantly tip- 
sy all afternoon, trying to 
submerge the recurrent 
thought that this couldn’t 
really be going to happen. 
Sandane continued to act the 
affable host, but made no 
move to put his plan into op- 
eration. They were in San- 
dane’s compartment when the 
loudspeakers announced that 
passengers who were leaving 
the train at Oakland should 
get ready. The waiting was 
getting on the old man’s 
nerves. 

“All right,” he told San- 
dane, “if this is all a gag, the 
joke’s finished.” 

“It’s not a joke,” Sandane 
protested. 

“Then put up or shut up.” 
“Very well,” Sandane said. 
“Close your eyes and relax. 
You will go to sleep for a few 
moments.” 

The old man was deter- 
mined to stay awake to see 
what went on. But in spite of 
himself, his eyes closed, his 
head drooped forward. He 
dreamed a long and involved 
dream about cities of the fu- 
ture, where all the people had 
miraculous powers. It seemed 
to go on for days, yet when he 
awoke, with a start, the train 
still had not reached Oak- 
land. 

He stood up abruptly as he 
realized that he was alone in 



SYLVIA JACOBS 




the compartment. Where was 
Sandane? Next he realized 
that he was standing, that he 
was Sandane, or at least in 
Sandane’s body. He took two 
steps to the mirror and stared 
at it. Cutaway, striped pants, 
face the spitting image of Wy- 
att Earp. It was the old man 
in the wheelchair who had 
left the compartment. 

When he disembarked at 
San Francisco, he scanned 
the crowd for the wheelchair 
and soon spotted it. Edna had 
spotted it first — she was push- 
ing it herself while a redcap 
followed, carrying the blanket 
and the old battered valise 
that the occupant of the chair 
had insisted on taking into 
his own coach. George tipped 
his derby to Edna. 

“Mrs. Bowers, I presume? 
Your father was telling me 
many nice things about you 
on the train.” 

Edna laughed. “So you’re 
the gentleman he was with ! I 
guessed from his breath he’d 
had company!” 

“Now, Edna,” a cracked 
old voice complained, “ain’t 
no harm in buying a few 
drinks for an old man.” 

G EORGE looked at the man 
in the chair in amazement. 
Was that the way he had 
sounded? Somehow, through 
the hearing aid, his own voice 
had seemed louder, less falter- 
ing. 

“Only too happy to do it, 
sir,” George said. “The pleas- 

YOUNG MAN FROM ELSEWHEN 



ure was all mine.” He wanted 
to add that Sandane was act- 
ing his part superbly, but 
didn’t know just how to say it 
before Edna. 

“We could give you a lift to 
your hotel,” Edna suggested. 

“Thank you, madam, but I 
don’t believe I shall check in- 
to a hotel as yet. I shall leave 
my bags here until later in the 
evening.” George was sur- 
prised how quickly he had as- 
sumed the manner of" speak- 
ing that went with his clothes. 

“Well, take a couple of 
drinks for me,” the old voice 
interjected. “Say hello to 
them pretty girls for me, too. 
So long, Sandy, and good 
luck.” 

“So long, George,” George 
replied, his voice choking up 
with pity for an old man who 
could not do what he wanted 
to do on this beautiful eve- 
ning, in this beautiful city. 

When they had gone, he 
walked out of the station, en- 
joying every step of the vigo- 
rous young legs, feeling every 
muscle of the vigorous young 
body, glowing with life. Out- 
side, he paused for a moment 
on the sidewalk before calling 
a cab. 

Two weeks, give or take a 
day or so, would be long 
enough to do the town. And 
two thousand dollars, give or 
take twenty, would be enough 
to do it on. The young-old man 
from elsewhen and the pres- 
ent was going to have one hell 
of a good time. enp

The skeleton 
had the fastest draw 
west of the 
Pecos. 
Too bad he was 
such a 
lousy shot 



BY JULIAN F. GROW 



H E was a big man, broad of 
shoulder, slim of hip. His 
Stetson was crimped Texas- 
style, over slate-gray eyes that 
impassively had seen much 
good and more evil in their 
twenty-six years. 

He stood in the saloon door 
with the dust of the streets of 
of Dos Cervezas Pequenas s$ill 
swirling about scuffed, range- 
rider’s chaps. His left hand 
held open the weatherbeaten 
swinging door. The right hov- 
ered over the worn peachwood 
butt of the Colt holstered on 
his right thigh. 

The slate-gray eyes, emo- 
tionless, swept the crowd bel- 
lied up to the bar, and stopped 
at one man. When he spoke it 
was flat, but with the ring of 
tempered steel, and every man 
but that one drew back out of 
range. “I want you, Dirty 
Jake,” the big man said. 
“Now.” 

Dirty Jake shot him into 
doll rags, naturally. 

D irty jake niedel- 

MEIER was, you might 
say, the most feared ribbon 
clerk in the Territory. Easily 
the most.

I remember him from the 
early days, from the first day 
he came to town, in fact. I re- 
member because he got off the 
stage just as I was leaning 
out the window nailing up my 
brand-new shingle, and my 
office was and still is up- 
stairs next to the stage depot. 
I was down on the boardwalk 
admiring it, all shiny gold leaf 
on black like the correspon- 
dence school promised: 

Hiram Pertwee, M.D. 

His voice broke in on me, 
all squeaky. “Beg your par- 
don," he said, “where’s the 
YMCA?” 

Well, that isn’t the usual 
sort of question for here. I 
turned around. There he was, 
a scrawny little runt about 
knee-high to short, wearing a 
panama hat, a wrinkled linen 
duster and Congress gaiters. 

He wasn’t especially dirty 
then, of course, only about 
average for a stage passenger. 
He kind of begrudged his face, 
with little squint eyes and a 
long thin nose, a mustache 
like a hank of Spanish moss 
and just about chin enough to 
bother shaving. Under his 
duster he wore a clawhammer 
coat, the only alpaca one I 
ever saw, and I never from 
that day out saw him wear 
any other. He stood there 
looking like he’d never been 
anyplace he really cottoned to, 
but this might just be the 
worst. 



I was just a young squirt 
then and not above funning a 
dude. I told him the YMCA 
was around the corner, two 
doors down and up the back 
stairs at the Owl Hoot Palace. 
He. nodded and went the way 
I told him. 

That was, and still is, 
Kate’s Four Bit Crib. The 
girls there wear candy-striped 
stockings and skirts halfway 
to the knee, and their shirt- 
waists are open at the neck. 
Dirty Jake didn’t speak to me 
for three years. 

He wasn’t Dirty Jake then, 
though, just Jacob Niedel- 
meier, fresh from selling rib- 
bons and yard goods in Perth 
Amboy, New Jersey and hot 
to find a fortune in the hills. 
He’d been a failure all his nat- 
ural life. This was a new be- 
ginning, for a man 34 who 
was already at the bitter end 
and looking for the path back. 
Gold was the way, he figured. 
He was going to get it. 

But he didn’t. He was back 
flat broke and starving in four 
months. 

He spent the next seventeen 
years behind the notions coun- 
ter at Martin’s Mercantile, 
selling ribbon and yard goods 
and growing old" two years at 
a time. I think it tainted his 
mind. 

Leastways, from the time I. 
got to know him, some four-’ 
teen years gone, he’s been 
what you might say, a queer 
actor. At first, when the store 
closed at sundown he’d take

off for the near hills with a 
pick and a sack, still seeking 
for color somebody might have 
missed. After a while he 
didn’t bother with the gear. 
He just moseyed around all 
that rock mostly, I suppose, to 
be away from people. 

Truth to tell, people were 
beginning to avoid him any- 
way. He was getting kind of 
gamy over the years, and can- 
tankerous generally. 

M AYBE it’s kind of funny 
we got more or less 
friendly but doctors and rib- 
bon clerks aren’t so all-fired 
far apart. They both have* to 
do with people and their ways, 
and like to get shut of both 
now and then. Every couple 
of months I’d go along with 
him up in the hills, to get the 
sick smell out of my nose. 
Night air and a night sky can 
be pretty fine if you’ve been 
looking at tongues and such 
long enough. 

Going out like that, we 
didn’t say much. I preferred 
it that way since Jake Niedel- 
meier was a boob. 

A smart man can get on 
tolerably well with an idiot if 
both just have sense enough 
to keep their mouths shut. One 
time he didn’t was when he 
brbught along a bottle of rye. 
He got started and was going 
on to beat the band, yapning 
about how life was a cheat 
and someday everybody’d re- 
spect Jacob Niedelmeier, un- 
til finally I lost patience and 

THE FASTEST GUN DEAD 



told him that while I treas- 
ured our association beyond 
pearls I’d chuck him off a cliff 
if he didn’t shut the hell up. I 
was nice about it, and after 
that it was like I said, toler- 
able. 

Well, sir, about two years 
ago he came into my office 
while I was darning up some 
fool borax miner that’d got 
himself kicked square in the 
bottle on his hip. Jake stood 
in the corner picking his 
teeth while I finished. After 
the borax miner limped out 
he spoke up. 

“Cornin’?” That was all the 
invitation he ever gave. 

“I guess,” I said. I sloshed 
the suture needle in a basin, 
gave it a couple of swipes on 
the hone stone and threw it in 
my satchel. That miner had a 
toue-h rind. 

Jake went out first. I closed 
the door behind us, not lock- 
ing it, of course, because our 
night marshal was kind of my 
relief surgeon whenever I was 
on calls. He was a Secesh hos- 
pital orderly during the Re- 
bellion. He was better with a 
saw than with sewing, but he 
could tie up most wounds well 
enough to do till I got back. 

Jake and I set out south up 
the mountain trail, but pretty 
soon it hit me he was heading 
someolace considerable more 
directly than we usually did. 

Sure enough, he took off at 
an anpf'e from the trail after 
a bit. We struck up into some 
fairly woolly country. He 

87 




wasn’t following any sign I 
could see, at least not by 
moonlight, but he kept going 
faster until I was plumb out 
of wind. 

We were in the hills over- 
looking Crater Lake when we 
came to kind of an amphi- 
theater in the rocks, some 
twenty feet across. He stopped 
at the edge of it and stood 
staring in, silent and breath- 
ing catchy. 

Me, I just chased my own 
breath for a while, then look- 
ed too and saw what he was 
aiming at. Right in the mid- 
dle, shining pale in the moon- 
shine like nothing else does, 
was a pile of old, old bones. 
Jake, I saw, had seen it be- 
fore. It was scaring him yet. 

O LD bones, sir, are still 
bones. I've seen and set 
my fill. But after I got a good 
look at these they scared me 
too. 

There were four skeletons 
altogether, all nicely preserv- 
ed, and only three of them 
Were men. Indians, I mean. 
You could tell that from the 
shreds of buckskin. Two of 
them still had weapons near 
their right hands : one a stone 
knife, the other a lance. And 
the top of each of the three 
skulls had been shot clean 
away. 

At least, half of the top had, 
and the same half on all three. 
Almost the entire os frontale 
and ossa parietalia on the left 
side was gone on each one. I 

88 



hunkered down to see closer, 
while Jake stood back and 
shook. 

I struck a sulphur match 
and saw something else about 
those three redskin skulls. The 
edges where the bone was 
gone weren’t fractured clean 
like a bullet or a club would 
do. They were charred. 

The three were sprawled 
around the fourth skeleton 
and that was the one gave me 
the vapors. It was more or 
less man-shaped. But it wasn’t 
a man, that I know. I don’t 
believe I care to find out what 
it was. Instead of ribs there 
was a cylinder of thin bone, 
and it had only one bone in 
the lower leg. What there was 
for a pelvis I’ve never seen 
the like, and the skull was 
straight out of a Dore Bible. 
There was a hatchet buried in 
that skull. 

The bones of the right arm 
were good and hefty, and it 
had two elbows. The left arm 
was about half the size — not 
crippled, but smaller scale. 
Like it was good for delicate 
work and not much else. 

About ten inches from the 
widespread six fingers of its 
right hand was what you 
knew right off was a weapon 
even if it did look like an um- 
brella handle. 

I was just reaching down to 
touch it when that fool Jake 
made his move. 

He’d been standing behind 
me. closer I bet than he’d ever 
got before, staring down at 

JULIAN F. GROW 




that fourth skeleton and mak- 
ing odd noises. I tell you, it 
was something for a medical 
man to see. Suddenly he 
grunted like he was going to 
be sick. He snatched up a fe- 
mur from one of the Indians 
and swung it up to smash 
that fourth skeleton to smith- 
ereens. 

Well, sir, quicker than the 
eye could see the umbrella 
handle smacked itself into the 
palm of that bony hand, send- 
ing fingers flying in six direc- 
tions. It hung there in the 
air against what was left, 
trained dead on Jake’s head, 
and it hummed. 

The femur dropped from 
Jake’s right hand like he’d 
been shot. He hadn’t, though, 
because he was still wearing 
his skull and by that time run- 
ning. Soon as he did, the um- 
brella handle flopped over and 
just lay there, the hum dying 
away. 

When it stopped the place 
was pretty quiet, because 
Jake was off in the rocks and 
I wqs going over some things 
I wanted to say to him imme- 
diately I was able to talk 
again. That fourth skeleton 
had the fastest draw I’d ever 
seen. 

Jake stuck his head up 
from behind a boulder. “Doc,” 
he said, “why didn’t he 
shoot?” 

T HE question wasn’t as all- 
fired pip-witted as Jake 
was capable of. It took me up- 

THE FASTEST GUN DEAD 



wards of three weeks to work 
out why a weapon that could 
draw and aim itself didn’t 
shoot too. 

I’d heard a little clink when 
the weapon flew into the skele- 
ton’s hand. It came from a 
metal disk that lay in its palm, 
toward the heel of the hand. 

The disk was thin and only 
about as big as a two-cent 
piece. A mate to it was set in 
the butt of the umbrella han- 
dle, convex where the other 
was concave. 

Going at it kind of ginger- 
ly, I slid the disk in my vest 
behind my watch and put the 
umbrella handle in my right 
coat pocket. 

It was a key-wind repeater 
with a gold hunting case, that 
watch, and I worried about it 
every step down the mountain. 
I walked a good four hundred 
yards behind Jake all the way 
back into town, just to be on 
the safe side. We didn’t ling- 
er, either. We wanted lights. 

By the time I got the two 
objects locked in my rolltop 
my heartbeat in anybody else 
would have had me telling the 
sexton to start his hole. I pre- 
scribed bed for me, told Jake, 
who hadn’t hardly even drawn 
breath the whole time, to go 
to hell and retired. 

N EXT day a squabble came 
up over some borax rights 
upcountry. I didn’t get to open 
that rolltop for a time. Then 
one early morning coming 
back in the buggy from a 

89 




house-call in Pockmark, forty- 
odd miles north, I got to wor- 
rying again at the umbrella 
handle and those dead Indi- 
ans. 

Seems like four, five times 
a week some chunkhead hunk- 
ers down hard with his spurs 
on. When I got to the office 
that night there was one wait- 
ing — a bad one, Spanish row- 
els — and Jake was sprawled 
in my chair, picking his teeth 
with my spare scalpel. I 
patched up the chunkhead, 
took the scalpel from Jake 
and rinsed it off and watched 
him suck his teeth for a while. 
It began to look like he was 
going to be stubborn. So final- 
ly I said: “Say, Jake.” 

He grunted. “Jake,” I said, 
“I think I’ve got that dingus 
figured.” He snuck a glance 
over at the desk so I knew he 
knew what I meant, but he 
was busy pretending that 
wasn’t what he came to talk 
about. 

“I think it’s a gun that can 
read minds like a gypsy,” I 
said. Jake still looked bored, 
so I took the umbrella handle 
out of the rolltop and waved 
it at him. He dove off the 
chair and started rolling for 
the door. 

“You damn fool,” I said, 
“it won’t go off.” I was rea- 
sonably certain it wouldn’t, 
but I laid it back down by the 
disk gently anyhow and sat in 
the chair. I’ve only got the 
one chair, on the theory that 
anybody who isn’t bad enough 

90 



to lie on the table is well 
enough to stand. Jake edged 
over and stood like a short- 
legged bird on a. bobwire 
fence. “It kin whut?” he said. 

“It can read minds,” I said. 
“You were going to bash 
those bones. The gun knew it 
and trained square on your 
head. You remember?” 

He remembered. “And those 
Indians,” I went on. “You re- 
member them? The left side 
of the head on each of them 
was blown off.” 

I hauled down a roller chart 
of the human skeleton, first 
time I’d done that since I 
don’t know when. 

“This up here is the brain,” 
I said. “We don’t know a hell 
of a lot about it, but we do 
know it’s like a whole roomful 
of telegraphers, sending mes- 
sages to different parts of the 
body along the nerves. They’re 
like the wires. This left hemi- 
sphere — right here — sends to 
the right side of the body. 
Don’t fret about why, the 
nerves twist going into the 
spinal cord. 

“Okay. We know, too, that 
the part of the brain that 
sends to the arm is right here, 
in the parietal lobe. Right un- 
der the chunk of skull that 
was shot off on those three 
Indians.” 

“Shaw,” Jake said, perch- 
ing on the table. The old billy- 
goat was beginning to get im- 
pressed, even if he didn’t have 
any notion of what I was talk- 
ing about. 



JULIAN F. GROW 




1 DIDN’T have exactly much 
notion either, but I kept 
on. “The brain works by a 
kind of electricity, same kind 
as in the telegraph batteries 
at the depot. This gun,” . I 
tapped the umbrella handle 
and Jake started off again, 
but caught himself, “has some 
sort of detector, a galvanic 
thermometer that senses elec- 
trical messages to the nerves.” 
From here on in it was 
pure dark and wild hazard. 
“Obviously,” I said, “when- 
ever one of those signals goes 
from this cerebral motor area 
here in the left hemisphere 
down to make the weapon 
hand move, it must be a spe- 
cial signal this gun was built 
to catch. Just like a lock is 
made for one particular key. 

“And near as I can figure, 
the gun has to be able to tell 
when that move coming up is 
going to be dangerous to the 
man holding it. Stands to rea- 
son if it can tell when a 
brain’s signalling a hand, it 
can tell too if that brain is 
killing-mad. Some people can 
do that, and most dogs. 

“So, if it senses murderous 
intent and a message to the 
weapon hand to move, it 
moves too, and faster. 

“It homes on this disk like 
a magnet right into the hand 
of the gent that owns it. and 
aims itself plumb at the place 
the signal is coming from.” I 
tapped the chart. “Right 
here.” 

I poked the gunk out of a 
THE FASTEST GUN DEAD 



corncob, packed it and lit up 
before going on. Jake stared 
at the umbrella handle like a 
stuffed owl. 

“Now, that fourth skeleton 
we saw sure as hell isn’t hu- 
man. He isn’t from anywhere 
on this green earth, or I miss 
my guess. Might even have 
something to do with Crater 
Lake there, years ago. But we 
aren’t likely to find out. 

“But we do know that he 
fought three Indians that 
probably jumped him all at 
once. And he killed every one 
of them with this gun before 
he fell.” 

That brought Jake up short. 

The Territory is kind of 
violent generally, and any- 
body or anything, good along 
that line would be bound to 
have the sober respect of a 
ninny like Jake. 

I dug up an old glove, and 
used spirit gum to stick in its 
palm the little disk from the 
skeleton’s hand. I pulled the 
glove on my right hand, and 
stood up with my hand about 
a foot over the umbrella han- 
dle. 

“Okay,” I said, “kill me.” 

H E was so orry-eyed by 
then he damn near did it 
just to be obliging. But then 
the recollection of the night 
on the mountain, and the 
three Indians with their heads 
shot off, sifted through and 
he shied off. “Hell no,” he hol- 
lered, “I seen that thing go 
before! I ain’t about to get 

91 




my head blowed to bits !” And 
he went on. 

Well, it took me the best of 
two hours. I showed him the 
two studs on the underside 
that most likely were a safety 
device. I explained how prob- 
ably the gun wouldn’t go off 
unless somebody was holding 
it with a finger between those 
studs, which was why it didn’t 
shoot when it went into the 
skeleton’s hand that night. I 
finally got him by telling him 
if I was right, we’d wire the 
fourth skeleton together, take 
it back East and earn a mint 
of money on the vaudeville 
stage showing the fastest ca- 
daver in the West. 

“Mr. Bones: Faster than 
Billy the Kid and Twice as 
Dead,” I said we’d bill it. 
Jake, he thought that was a 
lovely idea, and decided to go 
along. 

Fourteen times that eternal 
jackass raised his right arm 
at me, while I held my own 
gloved right hand over the 
weapon. But he didn’t have 
any real heart for it, and 
fourteen times the gun just 
lay there. Then I got a mite 
impatient, and kicked him in 
the kneecap. That fifteenth 
time he was truly trying. 

Skinny as he was he’d have 
driven me clear through the 
floor, except that umbrella 
handle jumped into my glove 
and aimed dead at his fore- 
head, snarling like a cougar. 
More correctly, the left side 
of his forehead. If I hadn’t 

92 



braced my index finger out 
stiff, that fifteenth time 
would’ve had him a dead man. 

Jake froze like a statue and 
hung in the air staring at the 
gun, snarling away in my 
hand. Finally I pulled the 
glove off with the gun still 
stuck to it, and flung it on the 
desk. 

Then Jake gave me the six- 
teenth, and by the time I got 
up again he was gone and the 
gun and the glove with him. 

N EXT morning the borax 
squabble blew up again. 
What with miners getting 
stomped I didn’t get to bed 
for a week, much less have 
a chance to find out where 
Jake and that damned weapon 
had lit out for. By the time I 
did, it was too late. Jacob 
Niedelmeier, the ribbon clerk, 
after seventeen years was on 
his way to glory as the legen- 
dary Dirty Jake. 

I got the start of the story 
from a drifter, name of Hu- 
bert Comus. He’d got into 
kind of a heated discussion in 
a saloon south a ways that 
ended with him and this other 
man going for their hardware. 
Hubert got his Merwin & 
Bray .42 out and, being a fool, 
tried fanning it. Of course it 
jammed and he laid the heel 
of his hand open clear to the 
bone. 

Twasn’t the hand bothering 
Hubert, though. Like most, 
the other man missed him 
clean, but when the barkeep 

JULIAN F. GROW 




threw them both out Hubert 
lit sitting on the boardwalk 
and took a six-inch splinter 
clear through his corduroys. 

While I was working on 
him he told me about Jake. 

A man, it seems, had turn- 
ed up in a little settlement 
called Blister, about two days 
down the line. Nobody noticed 
him come in, except that he 
was wearing one glove, a 
shiny clawhammer coat and 
Congress gaiters. The general 
run in the mining camps 
doesn’t wear Congress gaiters. 

He got noticed, though, 
when he showed up in a bar- 
room wearing a pearl-gray 
derby with an ostrich plume 
in the band, and carrying a 
rolled-up umbrella under his 
arm. The little devil had stuck 
the shaft of a regular umbrel- 
la in the muzzle of the skele- 
ton’s weapon. 

It turned out he’d bought 
the derby that the storekeeper 
there had planned to be bur- 
ied in. Where the ostrich 
plume came from I never did 
find out. 

“He come right in the 
swingin’ door an’ stood there,’’ 
Hubert said over his shoulder, 
“lookin’ at the crowd. Purty 
quick they was all lookin’ 
right back, I kin tell you. That 
feather fetched ’em up sharp. 
Take it easy back there, will 
you, Doc? Then Homer Cava- 
naugh, the one they called 
Ham Head, he bust out laugh- 
ing. He laughed so hard he 
bent over double, and the rest 

THE FASTEST GUN DEAD 



of the boys was just begin- 
nin’ t’laugh too when the little 
feller picked up a spitoon and 
dumped it down Ham Head’s 
neck. 

“The boys got mighty quiet 
then. Hey, easy, Doc, will 
you? Ham Head straightened 
up and his face went from red 
as flannels to white, just like 
that. He stood glarin’ at the 
little feller for a couple of 
ticks, openin’ and closin his 
fists, and then that big right 
hand went for the Smith & 
Wesson in his belt. 

“Well, it was a double-ac- 
tion pistol and had a couple 
notches in the grip, but Ham 
Head never cleared it. I never 
even seen the little feller 
draw, but there was Ham 
Head failin’ with half his nog- 
gin shot away. Gently, will 
you, Doc, gently! 

“The little feller stood lean- 
ing on his umbrella, lookin’ 
down at him. ‘What was that 
man’s name?’ he says. ‘Ham 
Head Cavanaugh,’ somebody 
says back. ‘Ham Head Cava- 
naugh,’ the little feller says, 
‘he’s the first.’ Then he shoves 
the umbreller back under his 
arm and goes out. We never 
saw him again. 

“Some say it was a bootleg 
pistol he used, or a derringer 
in his sleeve. And some say 
he had a pardner with a rifle 
in the street, but there wasn’t 
nobody there. I was standin' 
as close to him as I am to you, 
Doc, and I swear — it — was — 
that — um — breller — OW !” 

93 




H am head Cava- 
naugh was the first. I 
had kind of a personal inter- 
est in Jake and his weapon, so 
I kept track. There was Curly 
Sam Thompson, Big John Bal- 
lentine, Redmeat Carson, Uri- 
ah Singletree and twelve oth- 
ers known of, all dead within 
eighteen months. Any man 
Jake could hoorah into a fight. 
With never a chance to get 
his right hand on iron before 
his head gave the signal and 
got blown off. He took them all 
on. And he never lost — be- 
cause he couldn’t. 

Jake was king-o’-the-hill 
now, all right. He had the 
success he yearned for. 

Yet when he came back to 
see me last April it wasn’t to 
brag. He was in trouble. I 
looked up from a customer, a 
damn fool that’d sat on a gila 
monster, and there he was, 
sneaking in the door bare- 
headed like a whipped hound, 
not the cock of the walk in 
the whole Territory. He slid 
into the back room like a sha- 
dow, and the man I was work- 
ing on never even knew he’d 
come. 

When I went in afterward 
the lamp was out, the shade 
was down and he was in a 
corner, nervous as a jackrab- 
bit an eagle just dropped in a 
wolf den. “Buried my derby 
under a pile of rock up in the 
mountains,” he whispered. 
“Look,” and he held out his 
glove. 

It was plumb worn out. The 
94 



little metal disc was hanging 
on by a strand of spirit gum, 
and the fabric of the palm was 
in shreds. 

I looked at him for a min- 
ute without saying anything. 
He was still wearing the claw- 
hammer coat, over B.V.D. 
tops, but it looked like he’d 
been buried weeks in it and 
dug up clumsy. He had on 
greasy rawhide breeches and 
battered cowhand boots for 
shoes. He had a month’s beard 
on his lip and he stunk. 

This here was legendary 
Dirty Jake, no question about 
it. 

“Get a new glove,” I said. 

“Nope,” he answered, “no 
good. Last week in Ojo Rojizo 
I took the glove off to scratch 
and right then a man braced 
me. He threw me in a horse- 
trough when I wouldn’t fight. 
I want you to fix me up good. 

“I want you to open my 
hand up and set the dingus 
just under the skin, and sew 
it up again. Knew a feller did 
that with five-dollar gold 
pieces cuz he didn’t like banks. 
Worked fine till he got a coun- 
terfeit, and it killed him. 

“I’ll lay low in the hills till 
the hand heals. No problems 
after that.” 

No problems? Maybe so, 
but I’d been doing some think- 
ing. Still, I kept my mouth 
shut and did what he wanted, 
and he slunk off with no 
thanks. Don’t guess I really 
had any coming. 

After he left I got out my 

JULIAN F. GROW 




tallybook and ticked off the 
men Dirty Jake had killed: 
One Eye Jack Sundstrom, Fat 
Charlie Ticknor, Pilander 
Quantrell, Lobo Stephens, 
Alec the Frenchman Dubois, 
some jackass Texas nobody 
even knew and the rest, all 
men whose brains had tele- 
graphed a special signal to 
Jake’s gun before it reached 
their own right hand. Well, 
there was a new pistolero in 
town. 

A month and a half later I 
was craned around, trying to 
lance a boil of my own, when 
out of the corner of my eye I 
saw Dirty Jake go by under 
my window. He’d dug that hat 
with the ostrich plume out 
from under the rocks, his 
hand was healed, he was 
swinging his umbrella and he 
didn’t so much as look up. He 
was headed for the Owl Hoot 
Palace. I decided the boil’d 
wait. 

Less than five minutes later 
I heard the shots, two of them. 



A second later Jubal Bean, 
swamper at the Owl Hoot, 
came pounding up the board- 
walk and hollered in the door : 
“Doc, better come quick. 
Dirty Jake just took a couple 
slugs in the chest and he nev- 
er even got to draw !” 

I took my time. “It was 
just a matter of odds,” I said. 
“Who got him?” 

“The new one,” Jubal said, 
“the man they call Lefty.” 

W ELL, a couple more 
weeks to bleach, a little 
wiring, and I’ll be heading 
East. Look for the billboards:

IS WHEN 



• • • • 



. intelligence comes to grips with 

the universe — and the results are something 

wonderful — and strange! 



T HE largest and noisiest of 
all the unsettled argu- 
ments in science fiction is the 
simple (ho-ho!) matter of de- 
fining it. Like certain other 
imponderables, such as love, 
and the blues, and the exact 
meaning of an abstention in 
a UN vote, the matter is best 
handled by describing not na- 
ture, but function. Love, a 
young lady was heard to re- 
mark, is when you wake up 
knowing it will be wonderful 

96 



also to get out of bed. The 
blues, said a rough-hewn poet, 
is when you got the best steak 
in the whole wide world and 
the salt-cellar just cries all 
over it. Science fiction, then, 
is when someone looks at what 
is there for anyone to look at, 
and suddenly makes some- 
thing new and wonderful out 
of it. 

The breeze of s-f, in this 
sense, must have been ruffling 
the hair of the encyclopedist 

SF 





who wrote the article ATOM 
in the famous 11th edition of 
the Brittonica, published just 
fifty years ago. For after a 
clear and careful description 
of atomic theory, most of 
which was then set up to 
agree with the definition of 
the atom as “indivisible,” he 
concluded as follows: 

The atomic theory has 
been of priceless value to 
chemists, but it has more 
than once happened in the 
history of science that a 
hypothesis, after having 
been useful in the dis- 
covery and co-ordination 
of knowledge has been 
abandoned and replaced 
by one more in har- 
mony with later discov- 
eries. Some distinguished 
chemists have thought 
that this fate may be 
awaiting the atomic theo- 
ry, and that in future 
chemists may be able to 
obtain all the guidance 
they need from the sci- 
ence of the transforma- 
tions of energy. But mod- 
ern (this means 1910) 
discoveries in radioactiv- 
ity are in favour of the 
existence of the atom, al- 
though they lead to the 
belief that the atom is not 
so eternal and unchange- 
able a thing as Dalton 
and his predecessors im- 
agined, and in fact, that 
the atom itself may be 
subject to that eternal 

SF 



law of growth and decay 
of which Lucretius 
speaks. 

Science fiction is when a 
man sits amidst several dozen 
imperial bushels of evidence 
to the contrary, and dares to 
make a breathtaking intui- 
tive sweep like that. To realize 
fully what a heady grab this 
was, it is worthwhile digging 
a little further to find out 
something about the two boys 
he mentioned. 

J OHN DALTON, away back 
in 1803, took the atom-is- 
indivisible theory away from 
philosophers who had been 
tonguing and gumming it for 
a thousand years, and really 
put it to work — to such a de- 
gree that many people think 
he invented it. He didn’t, but 
the amount of solid experi- 
mental work he did on it made 
it his. He pulled a vast amount 
of vague reporting into line 
and invented an ingenious, if 
somewhat unwieldy, system of 
symbols which clearly showed 
his belief that an atom is an 
atom, an element is made of 
atoms of one kind and a com- 
pound is made by certain fixed 
quantities of each kind of 
atom which kept their relation 
to one another no matter how 
much or how little was com- 
pounded. He made it possible 
to predict and to explain thou- 
sands of chemical actions, set 
chemistry on its feet — and 
made “the atomic theory” 

97 




(the atom-is-indivisible) un- 
shakeable and unbreakable 
for more than a century. And 
if science fiction is when some- 
one takes common ho-hum evi- 
dence and makes something 
new and wonderful out of it, 
then it’s fair to say it touched 
Dalton too. 

But let’s have a look at the 
other character the Britan- 
nica writer mentioned. The 
atom may, he said, “be sub- 
ject to that eternal law of 
growth and decay of which 
Lucretius speaks.” 

Titus Lucretius Carus was 
born around 98 B.C. and prob- 
ably died in 55 B.C. Of sev- 
eral accounts of his life, by 
far the most appetizing is the 
one which says that he became 
mad in consequence of quaf- 
fing a love-philtre and, after 
writing a number of books in 
his lucid intervals, knocked 
himself off when he was 44. 

Whatever his habits and 
pastimes, he was an extraor- 
dinary man: poet (truly a 
great one), philosopher and, 
in the truest sense, theoretical 
scientist. His great work, De 
Rerum Naturae, called unique 
in literature, is a reasoned 
system of philosophy, written 
in verse. Its main idea is the 
truth of the laws of nature vs. 
superstitions. And he wrote 
not like a speculator, who 
wondered if, but like a teach- 
er, who knew. He wrote, says 
the Britannica, “to clear the 
mind from the fear of the

By MAX WILLIAMS 



THE 

SEEDER 

Being just plain Pop was not enough 
— he was bucking for All - Fatherhood. 



I T TOOK me less than three 
thousand years to catch up 
with Pop; which, all things 
considered, was pretty good 
going. I came out of overdrive 
at 018970 hours in orbit 
around an ugly-looking A3- 
type planet, and there was his 
ship below me. 

J[ slammed my cruiser down 
right alongside — hard enough 
to pulverize a couple of feet 
of basalt and make Pop and 
his ship bounce a little. He’d 
put me to quite a bit of trou- 
ble and I was annoyed. 

Pop got to his feet and 
stood there looking kind of 
sheepish as I climbed out of 
the cruiser. The old fool had 
his helmet off and was breath- 
ing in the foul atmosphere as 
if it were health gas. His gills 



had begun to turn a little blue 
from the methane and C02. 
He was a character all right. 

His name wasn’t really 
Pop, of course. I guess the 
nickname had been tacked on 
because he was such an ec- 
centric. old codger, and be- 
cause he looked like a couple 
of billion years old. Actually, 
of course, he wasn’t nearly 
that old. 

“Welcome aboard planet,” 
he said. “I kind of figured 
you’d be along sooner or 
later. Or someone like you.” 

"Well, I’m here,” I said. He 
looked harmless, but I kept a 
201R projector on him just in 
case. Pop had given Security 
Division a lot of trouble, and 
I had strict orders. 

I crawled over to his ship 

99 




and slid inside. The cabin 
looked neat enough, but the 
old fool had so much junk 
crammed into the ship you 
could hardly turn around. I 
found what I was looking for 
toward the bow — row after 
row of cylindrical canisters. I 
broke one open and the bio- 
detector on my back began to 
stutter like crazy. I dropped 
it and sprayed them all until 
they glowed dull green. By 
then the contents were cooked. 

P OP was still standing in 
the same place when I 
crawled out, looking as casual 
as you please. He only had a 
few eyes on me. Most of them 
he had turned toward the 
planet’s oversize satellite and 
a raw, angry-looking sea that 
was breaking a few ship’s- 
lengths away. 

“How’d you catch up with 
me?” he asked. 

“Space warp. You left a 
trail a child could follow.” I 
moved around his ship and 
found the reason he was look- 
ing so innocent. He’d already 
set up one of his canisters 
and the seal was about to 
break. I sprayed it. So much 
for several billion one-celled 
forms of life bottled under 
pressure. 

“All right,” I said. “That’s 
the last of them. Let’s get go- 
ing.” 

“Okay,” said Pop. “Never 
argue with Security Division. 
Still, you’ve got to admit I 
gave you a good run for your 

100 



money. And I seeded quite a 
mess of planets.” 

I shouldn't have done it, 
but I was angry. I snapped a 
claw across his nerve center 
before he could draw it back 
into his shell. It must have 
hurt plenty, because ten or 
twelve of his eyes began to 
water. 

“Seeded, hell!” I said. “You 
touched down on exactly 9080 
planets, and I sterilized every 
one of them after you left. 
That’s what took me so 
long.” 

He seemed to shrink a little 
inside, and for the first time 
I realized just how old the nut 
really was. 

“All that time,” he said. 
“All that effort wasted. Damn. 
Double damn.” 

“You should have figured 
that in the first place,” I said. 
“Central Maxim 0438 clearly 
states that no life is to be 
introduced into the outer gal- 
axies. And don’t ask me why. 
I’m no biologist. I just follow 
orders.” 

- “Listen,” said Pop. “Please 
listen. Back at Central Gal- 
axy they think we — our race 
— is pretty much immortal. 
But they don’t know. They 
don’t know for sure if any 
life will be left in our galaxy 
after two or three hundi*ed 
wars like the last one and — ” 
“Hold it,” I said. “You’re 
wasting your time. I’m not a, 
philosopher and you know it.” 
“That’s right,” said Pop. 
“And you’re not a biologist, 

MAX WILLIAMS 




either. You told me.” He 
waved a claw in gesture of 
resignation number seven. 
“Well, maybe you’re right. 
Maybe I have been an old 
fool. Let’s go home. No use 
hanging around an ugly 
planet like this one.” He made 
gesture of contempt number 
fifteen. 

Well, I thought, that’s a re- 
lief. Maybe the old geezer 
wasn’t as crazy as I’d figured. 
Maybe he just needed some 
sense slapped into him. At any 
rate, he didn’t make any trou- 
ble when I disintegrated his 
ship — the old crate wasn’t 
spaceworthy to begin with — 
and he climbed into my cruis- 
er meek as could be. 

I PUT the drive in low and 
pulled out of the system. 
The next planet — Pop had 
landed on the third — was go- 



ing through G14 disintegra- 
tion into asteroids, but I 
eased through without any 
trouble and began to pick up 
speed. 

Just then Pop swung 
around in his seat and made 
good-luck gesture eight and 
long-life gesture twelve to- 
ward the planet we’d left. 

I stared at him. “I don’t get 
it,” I said. “Just a while ago 
you agreed that was an ugly 
hunk of rock. You even made 
contempt gesture fifteen — you 
spat on it.” 

“That’s right,” said Pop. ‘'I 
did, didn’t I? Right into a 
pool of brackish water.” Then 
he began to chuckle. He kept 
on chuckling for five years, 
until I got annoyed and slap- 
ped his nerve center again. 

Aside from that, the return 
voyage was uneventful.

THE POSSIBLE IMPOSSIBLE 

When referring to technological advances, the word “impossible” 
must be used, if at all, with utmost caution. We should not forget, 
however, that all speculation on nuclear power sources is still founded 
on rather shaky ground. Thus, we render our cause a service of dubious 
value by referring to such vague potentialities. I, for one, am not yet 
convinced that within the next quarter of a century we will have a 
nuclear drive that could economically compete with chemical power 
plants. <— Wernher von Braun

IF • Short Story 





IT WAS A DULL, 
ROUTINE LITTLE WORLD. 
IT DIDN’T EVEN HAVE 

AC,TY - m 

EVERYTHING IT HAD 
WAS 





THE GARDEN 




T HE protozoic recorder 
chirped like a bird. Not 
only would there be life traces 
on that little moon, but it 
would be a lively place. So 
they skipped several steps in 
the procedure. 

The chordata discerner read 
Positive over most of the sur- 
face. There was spinal fluid 
on that orb, rivers of it. So 
again they omitted several 



R. A. LAFFERTY 



tests and went to the cogni- 
tion scanner. Would it show 
Thought on the body? 

Naturally they did not get 
results at once, nor did they 
expect to; it required a fine 
adjustment. But they were 
disappointed that they found 
nothing for several hours as 
they hovered high over the 
rotation. Then it came — clear- 
ly and definitely, but from 



102 





quite a small location only. 

“Limited,” said Steiner, “as 
though within a pale. As 
though there were but one 
city, if that is its form. Shall 
we follow the rest of the sur- 
face to find another, or con- 
centrate on this? It’ll be 
twelve hours before it’s back 
in our ken if we let it go now.” 

“Let’s lock on this one and 
finish the scan. Then we can 
do the rest of the world to 
make sure we’ve missed noth- 
ing,” said Stark. 

There was one more test to 
run, one very tricky and dif- 
ficult of analysis, that with 
the Extraordinary Perception 
Locator. This was designed 
simply to locate a source of 
superior thought. But this 
might be so varied or so un- 
familiar that often both the 
machine and the designer of it 
were puzzled as to how to 
read the results. 

The E. P. Locator had been 
designed by Glaser. But when 
the Locator had refused to 
read Positive when turned on 
the inventor himself, bad blood 
developed between machine 
and man. Glaser knew that he 
had extraordinary perception. 
He was a much honored man 
in his field. He told the ma- 
chine so heatedly. 

The machine replied, with 
such warmth that its relavs 
chattered, that Glaser did not 
have extraordinary percep- 
tion; he had only ordinary 
perception to an extraordi- 
nary degree. There is a dif- 

IN THE GARDEN 



ference, the machine insisted. 

It was for this reason that 
Glaser used that model no 
more, but built others more 
amenable. And it was for this 
reason also that the owners of 
Little Probe had acquired the 
original machine so cheaply. 

And there was no denying 
that the Extraordinary Per- 
ception Locator (or Eppel) 
was a contrary machine. On 
Earth it had read Positive on 
a number of crack-pots, in- 
cluding Waxey Sax, a jazz 
tootler who could not even 
read music. But it had also 
read Positive on ninety per 
cent of the acknowledged su- 
perior minds of the Earth. In 
space it had been a sound 
guide to the unusual intelli- 
gences encountered. Yet on 
Suzuki-Mi it had read Posi- 
tive on a two-inch-long worm, 
only one of them out of bil- 
lions. For the countless identi- 
cal worms no trace of any- 
thing at all was shown by the 
test. 

So it was with mixed expec- 
tations that Steiner locked on- 
to the area and got a flick. He 
then narrowed to a smaller 
area (apparently one individ- 
ual, though this could not be 
certain) and got very definite 
action. Eppel was busy. The 
machine had a touch of the 
ham in it, and assumed an air 
of importance when it ran 
these tests. 

Finally it signaled the re- 
sult, the most exasperating re- 
sult it ever produces : the sin- 

103 




gle orange light. It was the 
equivalent of the shrug of the 
shoulders in a man. They 
called it the “You tell me 
light.” 

So among the intelligences 
there was at least one that 
might be extraordinary, 
though possibly in a crackpot 
way. It is good to be fore- 
warned. 

WO CAN the remainder of 

O the world, Steiner,” said 
Stark, “and the rest of us will 
get some sleep. If you find no 
other spot then we will go 
down on that one the next 
time it is in position under 
us, in about twelve hours.” 

“You don’t want to visit 
any of the other areas first? 
Somewhere away from the 
thoughtful creature?” 

“No. The rest of the world 
may be dangerous. There must 
be a reason that thought is 
in one spot only. If we find no 
others then we will go down 
boldly and visit this.” 

So they all, except Steiner, 
went off to their bunks then: 
Stark, the Captain; Gregory 
Gilbert, the executive officer; 
Wolfgang Langweilig, the en- 
gineer; Casper Craig, super- 
cargo, tycoon and 51% owner 
of the Little Probe, and F. R. 
Briton, S.J., a Jesuit priest 
who was linguist and checker 
champion of the craft. 

Dawn did not come to the 
moon-town. The Little Probe 
hovered stationary in the 
light and the moon-town came 

104 



up under the dawn. Then the 
Probe went down to visit 
whatever was there. 

“There’s no town,” said 
Steiner. “Not a building. Yet 
we’re on the track of the 
minds. There’s nothing but a 
meadow and some boscage, a 
sort of fountain or pool, and 
four streams coming out of 
it.” 

“Keep on towards the 
minds,” said Stark. “They’re 
our target.” 

“Not a building, not two 
sticks or stones placed togeth- 
er. That looks like an Earth- 
type sheep there. And that 
looks like an Earth-lion, I’m 
almost afraid to say. And 
those two . why, they could 
well be Earth-people. But with 
a difference. Where is that 
bright light coming from?” 

“I don’t know, but they’re 
right in the middle of it. Land 
here. We’ll go to meet them at 
once. Timidity has never been 
an efficacious tool with us.” 

Well, they were people. And 
one could only wish that all 
people were like them. There 
was a man and a woman, and 
they were clothed either in 
very bright garments or in no 
garments at all, but only in a 
very bright light. 

“Talk to them, Father Brit- 
on,” said Stark. “You are the 
linguist.” 

“Howdy,” said the priest. 

He may or may not have 
been understood, but the two 
of them smiled at him, so he 
went on. 



R. A. LAFFERTY 




“Father Briton from Phila- 
delphia,” he said, “on detach- 
ed service. And you, my good 
man, what is your handle, 
your monicker, your tag?” 
“Ha-Adamah,” said the 
man. 

“And your daughter, or 
niece?” 

It may be that the shining 
man frowned momentarily at 
this; but the woman smiled, 
proving that she was human. 

“The woman is named Haw- 
wah,” said the man. “The 
sheep is named sheep, the lion 
is named lion, the horse is 
named horse and the hoolock 
is named hoolock.” 

“I understand. It is possible 
that this could go on and on. 
How is it that you use the 
English tongue?” 

“I have only one tongue; 
but it is given to us to be un- 
derstood by all; by the eagle, 
by the squirrel, by the ass, 
by the English.” 

“We happen to be bloody 
Yankees, but we use a bor- 
rowed tongue. You wouldn’t 
have a drink on you for a 
tubful of thirsty travellers, 
would you?” 

“The fountain.” 

“Ah— I see.” 

B UT the crew all drank of 
the fountain to be sociable. 
It was water, but water that 
excelled, cool and with all its 
original bubbles like the first 
water ever made. 

"What do you make of 
them?” asked Stark. 

IN THE GARDEN 



“Human,” said Steiner. “It 
may even be that they are a 
little more than human. I 
don’t understand that light 
that surrounds them. And 
they seem to be clothed, as it 
were, in dignity.” 

“And very little else,” said 
Father Briton, “though that 
light trick does serve a pur- 
pose. But I’m not sure they’d 
pass in Philadelphia.” 

“Talk to them again,” said 
Stark. “You’re the linguist.” 
“That isn’t necessary here. 
Captain. Talk to them your- 
self.” 

“Are there any other peo- 
ple here?” Stark asked the 
man. 

“The two of us. Man and 
woman.” 

“But are there any others?” 
“How would there be any 
others? What other kind of 
people could there be than 
man and woman?” 

“But is there more then one 
man or woman?” 

“How could there be more 
than one of anything?” 

The captain was a little 
puzzled by this, but he went 
on doggedly : “Ha-Adamah, 
what do you think that we 
are? Are we not people?” 
“You are not anything till I 
name you. But I will name 
you and then you can be. You 
are named Captain. He is 
named Priest. He is named 
Engineer. He is named Flun- 
ky." 

"Thanks a lot,” said Stei- 
ner. 



105 




“But are we not people?” 
persisted Captain Stark. 

“No. We are the people." 
There are no people but two. 
How could there be other peo- 
ple?” 

“And the damnest thing 
about it,” muttered Langweil- 
ig, “is, how are you going to 
prove him wrong? But it does 
give you a small feeling.” 

“Can we have something to 
eat?” asked the Captain. 

“Pick from the trees,” said 
Ha-Adamah, “and then it may 
be that you will want to sleep 
on the grass. Being not of 
human nature (which does 
not need sleep or rest), it may 
be that you require respite. 
But you are free to enjoy the 
gardpn and its fruits.” 

“We Will,” said Captain 
Stark. 

They wandered about the 
place, but they were uneasy. 
There were the animals. The 
lion and lioness were enough 
to make one cautious, though 
they offered no harm. The two 
bears had a puzzling look, as 
though they wanted either to 
frolic with you or to mangle 
you. 

“If there are only two peo- 
ple here,” said Casper Craig, 
“then it may be that the rest 
of the world is not dangerous 
at all. It looked fertile wher- 
ever we scanned it, though not 
so fertile as this central bit. 
And those rocks would bear 
examining.” 

“Flecked with gold, and pos- 
sibly with something else,” 

1 106 



said Stark. “A very promising 
site.” 

“And everything grows 
here,” added Steiner. “Those 
are Earth-fruits and I never 
saw finer. I’ve tasted the 
grapes and plums and pears. 
The figs and dates are superb, 
the quince is as flavorsome as 
a quince can be, the cherries 
are excellent. And I never did 
taste such oranges. But I 
haven’t yet tried the—” and 
he stopped. 

“If you’re thinking what 
I’m afraid to think,” said Gil- 
bert, “then it will be the test 
at least : whether we’re having 
a pleasant dream or whether 
this is reality. Go ahead and 
eat one.” 

“I won’t be the first to eat 
one. You eat.” 

“Ask him first. You ask 
him.” 

“Ha-Adamah, is it allowed 
to eat the apples?” 

“Certainly. Eat. It is the 
finest fruit in the garden.” 

WVV7 ELL, the analogy 

W breaks down there,” 
said Stark. “I was almost be- 
ginning to believe in the thing. 
But if it isn’t that, then what. 
Father Briton, you are the 
linguist, but in Hebrew does 
not Ha-Adamah and Hawwah 
mean — ?” 

“Of course they do. You 
know that as well as I.” 

“I was never a believer. But 
would it be possible for the 
exact same proposition to 
maintain here as on Earth?” 



R. A. LAFFERTY 




“All things are possible.” 
And it was then that Ha- 
Adamah, the shining man, 
gave a wild cry: “No, no. Do 
not approach it. It is not al- 
lowed to eat of that one !” 

It was the pomegranate 
tree, and he was warning 
Langweilig away from it. 

“Once more, Father,” said 
Stark, “you should be the au- 
thority; but does not the idea 
that it was the apple that was 
forbidden go back only to a 
medieval painting?” 

“It does. The name of the 
fruit is not mentioned in Gen- 
esis. In Hebrew exegesis, how- 
ever, the pomegranate is usu- 
ally indicated.” 

“I thought so. Question the 
man further, Father. This is 
too incredible.” 

“It is a little odd. Adam, old 
man, how long have you been 
here?” 

“Forever less six days is 
the answer that has been giv- 
en to me. I never did under- 
stand the answer, however.” 
“And have you gotten no 
older in all that time?” 

“I do not understand what 
‘older’ is. I am as I have been 
from the beginning.” 

“And do you think that you 
will ever die?” 

“To die I do not under- 
stand. I am taught that it is 
a property of fallen nature to 
die, and that does not pertain 
to me or mine.” 

“And are you completely 
happy here?” 

“Perfectly happy according 
IN THE GARDEN 



to my preternatural state. But 
I am taught that it might be 
possible to lose that happi- 
ness, and then to seek it vain- 
ly through all the ages. I am 
taught that sickness and age- 
ing and even death could come 
if this happiness were ever 
lost. I am taught that on at 
least one other unfortunate 
world it has actually been 
lost.” 

“Do you consider yourself 
a knowledgeable man?” 

“Yes, since I am the only 
man, and knowledge is natural 
to man. But I am further 
blessed. I have a preternatur- 
al intellect.” 

Then Stark cut in once 
more: “There must be some 
one question you could ask 
him. Father. Some way to set- 
tle it. I am becoming nearly 
convinced.” 

“Yes, there is a question 
that will settle it. Adam, old 
man, how about a game of 
checkers?” 

“This is hardly the time for 
clowning,” said Stark. 

“I’m not clowning, Captain. 
How about it, Adam? I'll give 
you choice of colors and first 
move.” 

“No. It would be no contest. 
I have a preternatural intel- 
lect.” 

“Well, I beat a barber who 
was champion of German- 
town. And I beat the cham- 
pion of Morgan County, Ten- 
nessee, which is the hottest 
checker center on Earth. I’ve 
played against, and beaten, 

107 




machines. But I never played 
a preternatural mind. Let’s 
just set up the board, Adam, 
and have a go at it.” 

“No. It would be no contest. 
I would not like to humble 
you.” 

T HEY were there for three 
days. They were delighted 
with the place. It was a world 
with everything, and it seem- 
ed to have only two inhabi- 
tants. They went everywhere 
except into the big cave. 

"What is there, Adam?” 
asked Capain Stark. 

“The great serpent lives 
there. I would not disturb him. 
He has long been cranky be- 
cause plans he had for us did 
not materialize. But we are 
taught that should ever evil 
come to us, which it cannot if 
we persevere, it will come by 
him.” 

They learned no more of 
the real nature of the sphere 
in their time there. Yet all 
but one of them were con- 
vinced of the reality when 
they left. And they talked of 
it as they took off. 

“A crowd would laugh if 
told of it,” said Stark, “but 
not many would laugh if they 
had actually seen the place, or 
them. I am not a gullible man, 
but I am convinced of this: 
that this is a pristine and 
pure world, and that ours and 
all the others we have visited 
are fallen worlds. Here are 
the prototypes of our first 
parents before their fall. They 

108 



are garbed in light and inno- 
cence, and they have the hap- 
piness that we have been 
seeking for centuries. It would 
be a crime if anyone disturbed 
that happiness.” 

“I too am convinced,” said 
Steiner. “It is Paradise it- 
self, where the lion lies down 
with the lamb, and where the 
serpent has not prevailed. It 
would be the darkest of crimes 
if we or others should play 
the part of the serpent, and 
intrude and spoil.” 

“I am probably the most 
skeptical man in the world,” 
said Casper Craig the tycoon, 
“but I do believe my eyes. I 
have been there and seen it. 
It is indeed an unspoiled Para- 
dise ; and it would be a crime 
calling to the wide heavens 
for vengeance for anyone to 
smirch in any way that per- 
fection.

D OWN in the great cave 
that Old Serpent, a two- 
legged one among whose 

R. A. LAFFERTY 




names were “Snake-Oil Sam,” 
spoke to his underlings: 

“It’ll take them fourteen 
days to get back with the set- 
tlers. We’ll have time to over- 
haul the blasters. We haven’t 
had any well-equipped settlers 
for six weeks. It used to be 
we’d hardly have time to strip 
and slaughter and stow be- 
fore there was another batch 
to take care of.” 

“I think you’d better write 
me some new lines,” said 
Adam. “I feel like a goof say- 
ing those same ones to each 
bunch.” 

“You are a goof, and there- 
fore perfect for the part. I 
was in show business long 
enough to know never to 
change a line too soon. I did 
change Adam and Eve to Ha- 
Adamah and Hawwah, and 
the apple to the pomegranate. 
People aren’t becoming any 
smarter — but they are becom- 
ing better researched, arid 
they insist on authenticity. 

“This is still a perfect come- 
on here. There is something in 
human nature that cannot re- 
sist the idea of a Perfect Par- 
adise. Folks will whoop and 
holler to their neighbors to 
come in droves to spoil and 
mar it. It isn’t greed or the 
desire for new land so much — 
though that is strong too. 
Mainly it is the feverish pas- 
sion to befoul and poison what 
is unspoiled. Fortunately I am 
sagacious enough to take ad- 
vantage of this trait. And 
when you start to farm a new

world on a shoestring you 
have to acquire your equip- 
ment as you can.” 

He looked proudly around 
at the great cave with its 
mountains and tiers of mate- 
rials, heavy machinery of all 
sorts, titanic crates of food- 
stuff space-sealed ; wheeled, 
tracked, propped, vaned and 
jetted vehicles; and power 
packs to run a world. 

He looked at the three dozen 
space ships stripped and 
stacked, and at the rather 
large pile of bone-meal in one 
corner. 

“We will have to have an- 
other lion,” said Eve. “Bows- 
er is getting old, and Marie- 
Yvette abuses him and gnaws 
his toes. And we do have to 
have a big-maned lion to lie 
down with the lamb.” 

“I know it, Eve. The lion is 
a very important prop. May- 
be one of the crackpot settlers 
will bring a new lion.” 

“And can’t you mix another 
kind of shining paint? This 
itches. It’s hell.” 

“I’m working on it.” 

C ASPER CRAIG was still 
dictating the gram: 
“Amazing quality of lon- 
gevity seemingly inherent in 
the locale. Climate ideal. Day- 
light or half-light. All twenty- 
one hours from Planet Del- 
phina and from Sol. Pure wa- 
ter for all industrial purposes. 
Scenic and storied. Zoning and 
pre-settlement restrictions to 
insure congenial neighbors. A

completely plannned globular 
settlement in a near arm of 
our own galaxy. Low taxes 
and liberal credit. Financing 
our specialty — ” 

“And you had better have 
an armed escort when you re- 
turn,” said Father Briton. 

“Why in cosmos would we 
want an armed escort?” 

“It’s as phony as a seven- 
credit note!” 

“You, a man of the cloth 
doubt it? And us ready skep- 
tics convinced by our senses? 
Why do you doubt?” 

"It is only the unbelieving 
who believe so easily in obvi- 
ous frauds. Theologically un- 
sound, dramaturgically weak, 
philologically impossible, zoo- 
logically rigged, salted con- 
spicuously with gold and shot 
through with anachronisms. 
And moreover he was afraid 
to play me at checkers.” 

“What?” 

“If I have a preternatural 
intellect I wouldn’t be afraid 
of a game of checkers with 
anyone. Yet there was an un- 
usual mind there somewhere; 
it was just that he chose not 
to make our acquaintance per- 
sonally.” 

“They looked at the priest 
thoughtfully. 

"But it was Paradise in one 
way,” said Steiner at last. 

“How?” 

“All the time we were there 
the woman did not speak.”

THE 

WELL 

OF 

THE DEEP 



By LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. TN the center of the table 

I stood a miniature sun. In 
illustrated by other places, on other ta- 
dick francis bles, it might have been taken 
for a not-too-effective table 
lamp, since its plastic sur- 
face diffused the yellow light 
feebly. In the board room of 
Solar Productions, it was a 
sun. 

Bruce Kalder relaxed 
dreamily, and watched the 
“sun” flicker on and off when 
the chairman of the board 
thumped on the table. Old 
Holbertson was powerfully 
worked up about something, 
but he had talked in such 
long-winded circles that Kal- 
der had abandoned hope of 
finding out what was bother- 
ing him. 



112 




A billion burrowing humans had, made a 
world under the Earth’s crust — now one 
man had to keep it from being in vain. 



WISH 



Kalder suppressed a yawn, 
and looked across the table at 
June Holbertson. “She should- 
n’t wear low-cut dresses to 
board meetings,” he thought. 
He’d been intentionally avoid- 
ing looking at her because he 
didn’t want the board mem- 
bers to think that his ap- 
pointment was mainly due 
to her influence. But it was a 
foolish attitude to take. They 
probably already knew it, and 
besides, everyone else in the 
room was watching her. Ev- 
eryone except old Holbertson. 

She smiled faintly, and 
winked at him. 

Old Holbertson thumped 
the table again, and paused 
to take a sip of water. “Kal- 
aer,” he shouted, “this is 

THE WELL OF THE DEEP WISH 



damned serious, and it’s your 
problem. What are you going 
to do about it?” 

Kalder turned slowly, and 
faced the chairman of the 
board. From a condition of 
easy relaxation he had been 
slammed into one of stomach- 
twisting panic. His hands lay 
paralyzed on the arms of his 
chair. His dry tongue touched 
his dry lips, and recoiled. 

Old Holbertson had talked 
for maybe twenty minutes, 
and Kalder had listened at- 
tentively most of that time, 
and he hadn’t any idea what 
problem had the old man so 
upset. Worse, he still didn’t 
have much of an idea as to 
what his job was supposed to 
be. 



113 




June came to his rescue. 
“Uncle Emmanuel, this is 
Bruce’s first board meeting. 
Don’t you think he should 
know more about the problem 
before we ask him to solve it?” 
Old Holbertson sputtered. 
“He’s been on the job since 
this morning, hasn’t he? 
What’s he been doing?” 

From the other end of the 
table, Paul Holbertson spoke. 
“Takes more than three hours 
for a man to learn his way 
around this place.” 

“Bah !” old Holbertson said. 
“If he doesn’t know where the 
men’s room is by this time 
he . 

“I move,” Paul Holbertson 
said, “that we ask Mr. Kalder 
to have a full report ready for 
the next board meeting.” 
Seconded and passed. Kal- 
der breathed easily once more, 
but he did not relax again. 

W HEN the meeting broke 
up, Paul Holbertson 
crooked a finger at Kalder, 
and he and June followed him 
out. “My office, I think,” Paul 
said. He escorted them in, and 
found chairs for them. 

June sat down, and lit a 
cigarette. “Thanks, Dad,” she 
said. 

Kalder said, “I thought I 
was going to be fired before 
I’d learned what all the but- 
tons on my desk mean. Look 
—I don’t mean to be disre- 
spectful, but I listened as at- 
tentively as I could, and I still 
don’t know the problem.” 

114 



“Emmanuel rambles,” Paul 
said. “Getting on in years. 
He’ll retire in another year or 
so, and we’ll miss him. Given 
some alternatives, he’s almost 
infallible in making the right 
decision. Trouble is, in this 
case we have no alternatives. 
We have nothing. But you 
don’t know what the problem 
is. We’re having trouble with 
our writers. Hence your title, 
Director of Writer Person- 
nel.” 

“What sort of trouble are 
you having?” 

Paul Holbertson took a long 
time getting a cigar lit. He 
leaned back, stared at the ceil- 
ing, and puffed deeply. “They 
don’t write,” he said. 

“Yes,” he went on. “We 
have competent men. We 
know, by their past perform- 
ances. We pay the highest 
rates paid anywhere. We 
have the best writer’s Tank 
in the industry, and we oper- 
ate it at peak efficiency. And 
they don’t write. We’ve al- 
ways maintained a big inven- 
tory, fortunately, and kept 
more writers than we really 
needed, so we would have a 
big output and enough quali- 
ty to keep us on top. But the 
situation has really been get- 
ting worse for years and now 
it’s approaching the critical 
point. Our inventory has 
sagged. We've been dipping 
into the stock of scripts that 
have already been rejected, 
and even that won’t keep us 
going much longer. To quote 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 




Emmanuel, this is damned 
serious. 

“Solar Productions leases 
four wires, and our contract 
stipulates that we must run 
twenty-four one-hour films 
per day on each wire. That 
adds up to ninety-six films 
per day, which is a lot of 
films. We don’t have any 
trouble shooting it. Our or- 
ganization is tops, there. So 
are our facilities. We could 
shoot two hundred a day — if 
we had the scripts. But we 
can’t get the scripts.’’ 

“There hasn’t been any 
reduction in personnel?” Kal- 
der asked. 

“Certainly not. We have 
more writers than we’ve ever 
had, and we keep hiring them. 
We hire some that frankly are 
not qualified, just in the hope 
they’ll produce something for 
us. The quality keeps going 
down, and the number of 
scripts turned in gets less al- 
most daily.” 

“We,” Kalder said, with a 
heroic attempt at noncha- 
lance, “need an incentive sys- 
tem. Scrap our contracts. Cut 
our guaranteed wage to the 
legal minimum. Pay a bonus 
for each completed script, and 
work out a system of bonuses 
for quality.” 

Paul Holbertson shrugged, 
and waved his cigar. “Obvi- 
ously we did all that. Long 
ago. It didn’t help. And I’ll 
tell you one more thing that 
didn’t work out, just so you 
won’t try it. I got the foggy 

THE WELL OF THE DEEP WISH 



idea that the Tank was in- 
volved in some way, so I 
closed it down for a month. 
It damned near ruined us. 
Production dropped literally 
to zero. It spurted a little 
when I opened it up again, 
but not for long, and it’s been 
dropping ever since. Well — 
get to work on it. And remem- 
ber this — no childishly simple 
idea is going to solve this 
thing. We have some highly 
capable people on our staff, 
and none of them can cope 
with it. The trouble is, we’re 
dealing with' writers, and 
writers, damn them, are ar- 
tists. They’re a super-human 
branch of the sp'ecies, or may- 
be it’s sub-human. They don’t 
function normally, even when 
they act normally. They spend 
their lives giving tangible 
form to the intangible, pull- 
ing things out of their imagi- 
nation and making them real, 
and that’s something neither 
you nor I will ever under- 
stand. All I can say is, good 
luck.” 

“Thank you,” Kalder said. 

It was a big chance — a 
chance any of his friends 
would have jumped at glee- 
fully. He also had a hunch 
that, as far as the Holbert- 
sons were concerned, it was 
his only chance. 

Either he showed them that 
he was worthy of June, or 
they showed June how in- 
competent he was. They were 
a hard-boiled family. And all 
he had to work on was a prob- 



115 




lem that’d had them stumped 
for years! 

B Y his third day on the job 
Kalder had learned his 
way about the executive and 
editorial offices and gained a 
passing familiarity with the 
files. He decided to visit the 
writers’ Tank. The company’s 
swing train had just left, but 
since his new job was depriv- 
ing him of his usual daily ex- 
ercise in tennis and swim- 
ming, the idea of walking ap- 
pealed to him. 

He was carefully briefed on 
the route before he left, but he 
ran into trouble immediately. 
Q tunnel, which was the di- 
rect route to the Main, was 
blocked off. A guard waved 
him away as he started to 
enter. The last of the Q tunnel 
population was moving out. 
Men, women and children 
slouched past him. Each man 
cradled a TV set preciously in 
his arms. Women and chil- 
dren carried pathetic bundles 
of belongings. A few women 
also carried TV sets — lucky 
families, to have two! 

“What’s up?” Kalder asked 
the guard. 

“Radiation seepage,” the 
guard said shortly. 

Kalder walked a short dis- 
tance and turned off into a 
narrow passageway, thinking 
he might find his way 
through to the Main without 
going all the way to R tunnel. 
There were numbered door- 
ways along the passage, but 

116 



few doors. In the rooms be- 
yond there were people, and 
at least one TV set. Some- 
times there were several. 
Men, women and children sat 
around them, watching in- 
tently. 

The passage divided, divid- 
ed again, and gradually nar- 
rowed. At one point he met a 
woman, and they had to edge 
past each other sideways. He 
left the area of living quar- 
ters behind him, and paused 
in surprise to contemplate the 
unbroken walls of the pas- 
sageway. He vaguely recalled 
reports of a critical housing 
shortage. The reports were 
certainly true, because the 
number of TV sets he had 
seen in some of the rooms 
could only mean that several 
families were living there. 
But there would be room for 
a lot of families on this pas- 
sageway, if someone would do 
some digging. 

Eventually he found his 
way through to the Main. The 
huge, brightly lighted tunnel 
swarmed with humanity. 
Government swing trains 
came at regular intervals, 
moving slowly as their trac- 
tor drivers shouted people out 
of the way. Long lines waited 
in front of the supply depots. 
Many factory shifts were 
changing, the men of the new 
shift reporting with glum 
faces for their hour’s labor. 

Kalder stepped into the 
doorway of a medical clinic, 
amazed, watching house- 

LLOYD BIGGIE, JR. 




wives jostle for position in a 
fresh meat queue. He had 
passed this way many times 
before, but always in a swing 
train or private car. He had 
passed through blindly. Now 
he was seeing, for the first 
time, that vast lower class po- 
litely referred to as the peo- 
ple. 

He saw them as potential 
customers of Solar Produc- 
tions, which made them im- 
portant to him. 

As he continued to watch, 
he saw them as human beings 
like himself. And in some way 
which he did not exactly un- 
derstand, that made them 
more important. 

I T was afternoon when he 
reached Solar Productions' 
producing unit. He went to 
the executives’ dining room 
for a late lunch before he rode 
the elevator down to the Tank. 
His name brought him a quick 
interview with Barney Ful- 
ton, the Tank’s manager. 

Barney was a kindly old 
man who had been with Solar 
in one capacity or another all 
his working life. “The boss 
said you’d be around,” he 
said. "I’ll give you any help I 
can, but, hell, I haven’t got 
any answers.” 

“I’ll have to ask some fool- 
ish questions, because all of 
this is new to me,” Kalder 
told him. “Now — just what is 
the Tank?” 

"It used to belong to Pro- 
duction,” Barney said. “They 

THE WELL OF THE DEEP WISH 



still use it when they need it, 
but that’s only for the big 
scenes. Even then the writers 
kick up a fuss about it. 
They’ve pretty well taken the 
place over. The same thing 
has happened at the other 
studios. The Tank is supposed 
to give them ideas. Maybe it 
does. Who knows how a writ- 
er thinks? Jeff Powell, he 
writes nothing but love stor- 
ies, but when he comes in here 
he goes on an adventure jag. 
Maybe that gives him ideas 
for love stories. Who knows?” 

Kalder scratched his head, 
and said, “I don’t. Maybe 
you’d better let me look at it.” 

“Sure.” Barney went over 
to the door of his office, and 
shouted. “Pete! This is Mr. 
Kalder, the new vice-presi- 
dent Take him through the 
Tank, and don’t let him get 
killed.” 

Pete gave Kalder a broad 
grin, and led him away; 

They signed in at one of 
the Tank’s entrances, and 
stepped through a doorway 
to a scene of overwhelming 
grandeur. The spaciousness 
fairly took Kalder’s breath 
away. Accustomed all his life 
to rooms and passageways, he 
could only stand and stare. 

Ahead of them was a tang- 
led jungle. Beyond it a hill 
rose steeply, and beyond that 
other hills. There were glimp- 
ses of forests, of distant 
mountains. Overhead the ceil- 
ing arched upwards and up- 
wards and away to a far dis- 

117 




tant, brightly lit dome. 

“Pretty big, eh?” Pete said 
proudly. 

“It’s tremendous,” Kalder 
said. 

“We have it on a twenty- 
four hour day — day and 
night and everything. At 
night we turn off the lights 
and turn on the stars. We got 
a moon, too. Come on. We’d 
better stay clear of the jun- 
gle. They’re shooting a jungle 
film there, this afternoon.” 

T HEY skirted the jungle, 
climbed a tall hill, and 
stood looking down on the 
lovely, still blueness of a lake. 
“Where to?” Pete asked. 
Kalder consulted his note- 
book. “I’d like to look around, 
to see what the place is like. 
And then — do you know a 
writer named Walter Don- 
ald?” 

“Sure. Big- fellow, with 
blond hair. I know all the old- 
er ones. They’ve picked up 
some new ones lately, but not 
many of them have been us- 
ing the Tank.” 

“I’d like to find Donald.” 
“I’ll call in.” 

Pete went over to a control 
point to make his call, and 
came back shaking his head. 
“They dunno where he is. He 
probably didn’t make any spe- 
cial request. Sometimes a 
writer just looks around until 
he finds something that inter- 
ests him.” 

“I see,” Kalder said. He’d 
been checking through a lot of 

118 



records, and he had a hunch 
that Donald could give him a 
clue as to what was wrong 
with the writers. Donald had 
been the most prolific man on 
the staff, even though his out- 
put had fallen along with that 
of the others. Then suddenly, 
a month before, his work had 
stopped all together. Kalder 
found that Donald had en- 
tered the Tank and stayed 
there. He had signed in, and 
he had not signed out. He 
could not be located anywhere. 
Kalder wanted to know what 
he was doing. 

“Donald has been in here 
for a month,” he said to Pete. 
“Isn’t that a little long to be 
just looking around?” 

“Well,” Pete said, “he’s a 
writer . .” 

Down in the jungle, an ele- 
phant trumpeted and a rifle 
shot rang out. 

Kalder shivered, and sat 
down on the thick, simulated 
grass at the hilltop. Below 
him, a man rowed a small 
boat along the lake shore. 
Pete handed Kalder his bin- 
oculars. “It’s Jeff Powell,” he 
said. 

Kalder watched the awk- 
ward movements of the man 
in the boat. “Where would be 
a good place to look for Don- 
ald?” 

“Couldn’t say.. If he hasn’t 
asked for anything special, 
he could be anywhere. It’s a 
big place.” 

“I think I’d better talk to 
Barney,” Kalder said. 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 




He went to the control 
point, and asked Barney to 
have his men keep a lookout 
for Walter Donald. Barney 
said he’d have the concession- 
aires look for him; if Donald 
had been in the Tank a month 
he had to be getting food from 
somewhere or he was dead. 
Kalder told him he’d check 
again later. 

In the boat on the lake, 
Jeff Powell was getting ready 
to fish. Kalder had seen 
enough films to understand 
what he was doing. In fact, 
he thought he could have giv- 
en him a few pointers. 

After half a dozen timid 
gestures, Powell managed a 
feeble cast. As his lure hit the 
water the lake boiled and er- 
rupted. Powell knelt in the 
boat, pole bent double, and 
battled the monstrous fish. 

A trio of shark fins crossed 
the lake in precise formation, 
and circled the boat. Powell 
hauled valiantly on his line. 
The fish sounded, returned to 
the surface, suddenly shot off 
under the boat. Powell spun, 
lost his balance, and toppled 
overboard. 

“Damn,” Pete said. “There 
he goes again.” 

Kalder raised his binocu- 
lars and watched Powell 
drown. It was a drawn-out 
process. He gurgled and 
threshed, and his pathetic 
cries were frightening. Final- 
ly he sank out of sight. 

“Barney said one more time 
would be the end of it,” Pete 

THE WELL OF THE DEEP WISH 



said. “We’re not going to let 
him near the water again un- 
til he learns how to swim. 
Now we get another $16 re- 
suscitation bill.” 

T WO men came hurrying 
along the shore. They 
splashed into the water, 
hauled out Powell and carried 
him away. 

“We ought to leave him be 
dead,” Pete said. “He don’t 
write nothing but love stories 
anyway.” 

“If he writes anything at 
all,” Kalder said, “we need 
him.” 

An airplane roared over- 
head. Kalder watched it curi- 
ously, saw a man jump, saw a 
parachute billow out. It float- 
ed down towards the lake. The 
shark fins converged immedi- 
ately as the man hit the wa- 
ter. He got a raft inflated, 
and pulled himself in just as 
the sharks made their rush. 

Pete chuckled. “If Barney 
ever put teeth in them sharks, 
you’d be missing a lot of writ- 
ers.” 

Kalder continued to watch 
the airplane, which cut its 
motors abruptly and was 
lowered to the ground behind 
the trees on the other side of 
the lake. 

Another shot rang out in 
the jungle. Kalder got to his 
feet, and they circled the lake. 
At the next control point Pete 
called in. 

“Donald is hanging out 
around Area Five,” he said. 

119 




“That’s the big forest over 
yonder.” 

“What’s he doing there?” 
“Don’t know. That’s where 
he’s been eating. One of the 
concession men knows him. 
Want to find him?” 

“If we can.” 

“We’ll take a look.” 
Beyond the lake, they came 
to a desert. They plodded on- 
wards, sinking deeply into 
loose sand. In a small ravine 
they saw a man lying. His 
clothing was ragged, his fig- 
ure emaciated. He croaked 
after them, “Water!” 

They walked on. “That’s 
Bill Morris,” Pete said. “He 
asked Barney what it felt like 
to die of thirst. Barney told 
him to go out in the desert 
and find out.” 

Kalder nodded. Some of the 
writers used the Tank as a di- 
rect source of information. 
Others seemed to use it as a 
diversion — like Jeff Powell, 
who came in for adventure. 
Bill Morris would be getting 
an excellent idea of what it 
would be like to die of thirst 
in a desert. Except — He’d cer- 
tainly been at it for several 
days, and that was a big in- 
vestment in time in order to 
get the background for maybe 
one scene in an hour film. He 
might be able to use the back- 
ground in several scripts. But 
still . 

They left the desert and 
came to gently rolling farm 
land. Cattle grazed by a 
small, meandering stream. 

120 



Oddly enough, they were real 
cattle. 

Never having seen any, 
Kalder stopped to stare. They 
were eating something which 
had been spread out on the 
ground for them. 

Pete pulled Kalder to the 
right, and they entered a for- 
est. “Area Five,” he an- 
nounced. 

T HE synthetic trees were 
large, and well-spaced. 
Synthetic grass covered the 
ground between them. There 
was no undergrowth. 

“Shouldn’t be hard to find 
him,” Pete said. 

They separated, and met 
again further on, in a clear- 
ing. Kalder thumped on met- 
al, and looked upwards. 
“What’s this?” 

“Vent,” Pete said. “Solar 
power inlet. They’re all over 
the place.” 

“What’s inside?” 
“Machinery and stuff.” 
Kalder circled around the 
vent. The thing was enormous 
but he quickly lost interest in 
it and studied the surrounding 
forest. His hand came in con- 
tact with a door handle. He 
stopped in surprise, and 
opened the door. 

The vent stretched up- 
wards an interminable dis- 
tance, and ended in a blaze 
of light. Kalder staggered 
backwards, hands clasped to 
his eyes. It was a moment be- 
fore his vision returned to 
him, and when it did he saw,

a couple of feet below the 
door, a metal grating that 
spanned the vent. On the 
grating lay a man. 

Pete was beside him, look- 
ing in. “That’s Donald,” he 
said. 

It was a big man, a blond 
man, but his skin was burned 
black. Kalder said in alarm, 
“Donald?” 

“Let me alone,” Donald 
said. “Get the hell out of 
here.” 

He lay face down on the 
grating. He was nude, and he 
did not move when he spoke. 

“Maybe he’s sick,” Pete 
said. “He don’t look so good. 
Shall we take him out?” 

Donald sat up. “Sick?” The 
dark skin of his face twisted 
with convulsive bitterness. 
“You’re the sick ones. The 
dead ones. I’m getting some 
sunshine. This is one of the 
few places on this cursed 
planet where any can be had. 
Care to join me ? Then get out ! 
And leave me alone.” 

Kalder introduced himself. 
He was, he explained, con- 
cerned about Donald because 
he’d been in the Tank for a 
month, and because he wasn’t 
doing any writing. Would 
Donald mind telling Kalder 
what he was trying to do? 

“I’m trying to bore myself,” 
Donald said. 

He lay down again,' and 
added, “It isn’t easy.” 

Kalder and Pete withdrew 
quietly, and closed the door. 

“Out,” Kalder said. Pete 

THE WELL OF THE DEEP WISH 



obligingly led him to the near- 
est exit. 

K alder sought out his 
father that evening, to 
the older man’s intense sur- 
prise. 

Doctor Kalder had wanted 
his son to study medicine. 
Kalder knew only too well the 
deadly monotony of the medi- 
cal profession. Besides, he had 
no difficulty in finding more 
amusing ways of spending his 
time. 

It was only when he found 
that June’s family sternly dis- 
approved of a young man of 
twenty-seven who had no oc- 
cupation or profession that 
he decided to go to work. 

Doctor Kalder was on night 
duty at a small branch clinic. 
There were no patients, and 
the doctor had the place to 
himself. 

“How is the job going?” he 
asked. He had been relieved 
when his son finally decided 
to do something. 

“I don’t know,” Kalder 
said. “Tell me, dad, what’s the 
value of TV?” 

The doctor smiled slowly. 
“My guess would be that with- 
out it we’d have a serious 
situation on our hands in a 
matter of days. Maybe a rev- 
olution. Why?” 

“Tell me why?” Kalder 
said. And as the doctor looked 
at him in perplexity, he add- 
ed, “I just want to hear some- 
one talk about it.” 

The doctor sighed. “So it 

121 




has you discouraged already. 
You’ll have to learn to apply 
yourself, Bruce. What will 
happen to the human race if 
you youngsters shirk your re- 
sponsibilities? When the big 
move comes there won’t be 
enough educated and profes- 
sional people to keep things 
going.” 

“TV,” Kalder reminded 
him. “Why?” 

“There’s nothing for peo- 
ple to do — most people. It 
keeps them occupied. That’s 
pretty obvious, isn’t it?” 

“It seems to me that there’s 
lots of things people could be 
doing. We keep hearing about 
the housing shortage. I saw a 
mob of people moving out of Q 
tunnel over in Section 27. 

S here won’t be any places for 
lem to go unless they move 
in with someone else. They 
have all that time to watch 
TV. Why doesn’t someone put 
them to digging?” 

“It’s been tried,” the doc- 
tor said. “They won’t do it. 
That’s what brought oh the 
last riot, seven — no, eight 
years ago.” 

“Why won’t they do it?” 
“They’re satisfied with 
things the way they are. The 
four hours a week they accept, 
because it’s always been that 
way. As long as we’re able to 
feed and clothe them, and 
they're healthy, and they have 
fifteen films to choose from 
every hour, they won’t take 
more. Oh, they'd like better 
quarters if someone else 

122 



would fix them. But, as for 
doing it themselves — why, 
the men grumble about that 
for hours, and the women 
grumble about the time they 
spend waiting to buy their 
supplies. 

“I see,” Kalder said. He got 
to his feet. “How many doc- 
tors will we have thirty years 
from now?” 

“Enough for the present 
situation. Health is pretty 
well under control, down 
here.” 

“But supposing we’re ever 
able to get back to the sur- 
face?” 

“We won’t have enough of 
anything.” 

“I wish someone had spelled 
this out for me ten years ago.” 

“I tried, Bruce,” the doctor 
said. “I tried my best. Maybe 
I didn’t spell very well.” 

“Maybe I didn’t listen very 
well. But — thanks.” 

Before he went home to his 
own plush quarters in the 
Bachelor’s Club of Section 
317 — the section of the weal- 
thy — he walked around for a 
long time in a maze of pas- 
sageways, looking through 
doorways at the flickering TV 
sets. 

P AUL Holbertson bent over 
the charts, and fingered 
one thoughtfully. “Mmm, yes. 
I can see you’re working at it. 
We didn’t try this. Getting 
anywhere?” 

June leaned forward anx- 
iously, her hands clasped. 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 




“I can state the problem,” 
Kalder said. 

“The problem is that 
they’re not writing.” 

“No. That’s only one re- 
sult. The problem is they have 
lost interest in their subject 
matter. And they have lost 
contact with reality.” 

Paul Holbertson grinned 
slyly. He said to June, “You’ll 
have to keep this boy away 
from the library.” 

“I’ve done some reading,” 
Kalder said. “I’ve studied my 
charts. And I’ve talked with 
a lot of writers. With a re- 
corder. Listen." 

The voice was Walter Don- 
ald’s bitter, accusative. “I 
shall write no more comedies 
about pirate ships. Or the pri- 
vate lives of queens. Or ro- 
mances about knights in ar- 
mor. Or adventures in space. 
God, what a laugh that is! 
Man in space — when he can’t 
even get out of a hole in the 
ground! We’re drugging the 
people and ourselves with 
stories of things that aren’t, 
and can’t be — and I’m begin- 
ning to doubt that they ever 
were. Those things I can’t 
write, and I won't. What I 
can write I don’t know.” 
Kalder snapped it off. 

The president of Solar Pro- 
ductions said soberly, “This 
is more serious than I 
thought. Are they all like 
that?” 

“They’re all getting that 
way. Are our competitors 
having the same trouble?” 

THE WELL OF THE DEEP WISH 



“I haven’t any direct infor- 
mation, of course, but I’m cer- 
tain they are. Only yesterday 
I suggested to Roger Atley 
that we might be willing to 
give up one of our wires, so 
we could concentrate more on 
quality productions. He prac- 
tically begged me not to think 
of such a thing. Which means 
he’d have a tough time find- 
ing someone who could pro- 
vide material for it. Where 
do we go from here?” 

“We try to think of a way 
to renew their interest in 
their subject matter and put 
them back in touch with real- 
ity. I’m going to the library. 
By the way, I won’t be ready 
to face the board tomorrow 
morning.” 

“I don’t think it will be 
necessary. Leave your charts 
with me, and write up a short 
summary of what you’ve ac- 
complished to date. You’ve 
done an interesting thing, 
here, comparing number of 
scripts with time spent in the 
Tank. We’ll kick it around, 
and I’ll tell them you’ll have 
some definite recommenda- 
tions for the next meeting.” 
June took his arm as they 
went out, and in the corridor 
he placed an affectionate kiss 
on her forehead, and one con- 
siderably more affectionate 
on her lips. 

“Going to save the family 
business?” she said. 

“Is it that bad?” 

“Every hour on the hour, 
we have to have four new 



123 




films ready. One comedy, one 
romance, one adventure, and 
one miscellaneous. That’s 
ninety-six deadlines to meet 
every day. We’ve even taken 
to sneaking an old film in now 
and then, just to pad things 
out, but people have terribly 
long memories, and it will be 
bad if we’re caught. So — yes, 
it’s that bad.” 

“I believe there’s more at 
stake than you realize,” Kal- 

Hat* qq 

“What do you mean?” 
“Things are much worse 
than you think.” 

T HE Tank always seemed 
the same, in spite of the 
fact that there were different 
writers around, or writers 
doing different things. At Ar- 
ea Five Kalder found writer 
Jeff Powell lying on the syn- 
thetic gn*ass, staring at the 
synthetic forest. If Powell 
saw Kalder, he ignored him. 
Walter Donald was in his usu- 
al place in the vent. He made 
it very clear that he would 
like to ignore Kalder. 

“I have a problem,” Kalder 
said, “and I need your help.” 
Donald .rolled over on his 
stomach. The pattern of the 
grate was firmly impressed 
into his dark skin. 

“As a special favor,” Kal- 
der said, “Will you help me?” 
Donald did not look up. 
“What kind of problem?” 
“I’m trying to get a script 
written. It’s about a writer. 
He and his family live in a 

124 



small room over in Section 
495. He’s the only writer that 
lives around there, and all the 
other men are factory work- 
ers. This writer works hard 
at writing, and his family 
can’t understand why it takes 
so much time. The other men 
work for an hour, and then 
they come home and watch 
TV with their families. The 
writer works long hours, and 
he has to spend days in the 
Tank, looking for ideas. He 
makes good wages, and his 
family can have luxuries oth- 
er families can’t afford, but 
his children just can’t under- 
stand why he’s never home 
to watch TV with them. I 
can’t think of a way to end it. 
Can you help me out?” 

Donald said flatly, “Nuts. 
Didn’t you ever read Code? 
They’d never film a thing like 
that.” 

“Of course they’ll film it, if 
I can get it written. Question 

is, could you write it? I real- 
ize you’ve never done any- 
thing like that, and if you 
don’t think you could handle 

it, just say the word. I’ll look 
for someone else.” 

Donald sat up. He stared 
dully at Kalder, his scowl 
wrinkling dark lines in his 
dark forehead. The sunlight 
had bleached his blond hair to 
a startling whiteness. He 
said, “I know Code forwards 
and backwards. I could get 
fired for wasting time on 
something like that.” 

“I’m taking the responsi- 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 




bility,” Kalder said. “Could 
you write it?” 

“I don’t know.” He got up, 
and climbed out of the vent. 
“A writer, you say? How 
many children?” 

“That’s up to you. How 
many children do you have?” 
“Three. Three children. 
They want him to watch TV 
with them, you say? But he 
hates TV, of course, because 
he writes scripts for TV, so 
whenever they turn it on 
he ...” 

He pulled on his clothing 
and wandered away, mum- 
bling to himself. 

K ALDER went back to the 
edge of the woods, and 
sat down beside Powell. Pow- 
ell did not look at him. “In 
autumn,” he said, “the leaves 
turn color. Nature paints a 
masterpiece in the forest. By 
and by, the leaves fall to the 
ground. If I waited here long 
enough, do you suppose these 
leaves would change color and 
fall?” 

“Those leaves will never 
change color,” Kalder said. 

Powell winced. He regarded 
Kalder gravely. “Friend, have 
you ever seen a tree? No, not 
this junk. A real tree. Have 
you ever felt one? I’ve put 
lots of trees into my scripts, 
but I never saw a tree. Isn’t 
that ridiculous? What does a 
tree feel like? What does it 
taste like? Can you taste a 
tree?” 

“You write romance, don’t 
THE WELL OF THE DEEP WISH 



you?” Kalder asked the writer. 

“When I write, I write 
romances. Romances with 
trees. Meet me under the 
green willow tree, my love. 
The weeping green willow 
tree. Do you know what a 
weeping green willow tree 
looks like? Production doesn’t. 
I went to the library once, 
and found a picture. Produc- 
tion made my weeping green 
willow tree into an oak.” 
“According to the records, 
you’ve written a few come- 
dies, too. Think you could 
handle a romantic comedy?” 
“I am not feeling funny 
these days.” 

“This would be different. 
There’s a man who works in 
a factory, and he can’t get 
along with his foreman. They 
hate each other, and they’re 
always fighting about some- 
thing. Then the foreman’s son 
falls in love with this guy’s 
daughter. The two mothers 
get to know each other, and 
they try to help the kids while 
the two men are trying to 
keep them apart. I suppose it 
would be quite a job to keep 
it funny. If you don’t think 
you could do it . .” 

“Yeah,” Powell said. “Then 
the kids decide to break it up, 
to keep the old men happy, 
and the old men decide to pre- 
tend to be friends to keep the 
kids happy. Yeah.” He pushed 
himself erect. “Say, mister, 
did you ever hear about Code? 
They’d never film it.” 
“Certainly they’d film it. 

125 











LLOYD BIGGLE, JR 



I’d take care of that for you.” 
“If you say so. Let’s see, 
now. The foreman keeps try- 
ing to spy on his son, and the 
other guy keeps trying to spy 
on his daughter, so the two 
keep running into each other 
while . .” 

Kalder slipped quietly 
away. Wild profanity attract- 
ed his attention from the di- 
rection of the lake. A writer 
whom he did not know by 
sight was attempting to fish, 
and on his first cast Barney’s 
monster of the deep had 
snapped his line. 

“I have a problem,” Kalder 
said. “I want to get a script 
written. There’s this fellow 
who lives in a small room with 
his family, and when radia- 
tion seepage makes everyone 
move out on the next corridor, 
three families had to move in 
with them. He doesn’t like it, 
so he goes off to an undevel- 
oped corridor and digs out a 
new room for his family. Then 
he decides one room isn’t 
enough, so he digs out two 
more. Everyone thinks he’s 
crazy, wanting so much space, 
and when he gets through the 
government decides he has too 
much space, so five families 
are moved in with him. Do 
you think you can write it?” 
The writer dropped his 
fishing pole. He stuttered, 
“What — what about Code?” 

S OME of the faces were hos- 
tile. Several were violent- 
ly angry. June Holbertson 

THE WELL OF THE DEEP WISH 



looked hurt ; her father 
seemed merely puzzled. 

Kalder said calmly, “I ac- 
cept full responsibility.” 
“That’s all very well,” old 
Emmanuel Holbertson sput- 
tered. “You accept the respon- 
sibility, but it’s our reputa- 
tions that are ruined!” 

“To continue my report,” 
Kalder said, “I have organ- 
ized a small group of the com- 
pany’s writers. They repre- 
sent ten per cent of the total, 
and they are out-producing 
the other ninety per cent at 
the rate of ten to one. I have 
had fifty production units as- 
signed to my control. Those 
units are shooting scripts as 
fast as my writers can pro- 
duce them. I have assumed 
full responsibility for the com- 
pany’s fourth wire, the 
miscellaneous channel, and 
for the past two weeks that 
channel has carried nothing 
but films I have produced my- 
self. I will ask the Chairman 
of the Board: Has he received 
any complaints about the 
fourth channel programs?” 
“I saw some of those films 
myself, Kalder, and I’m com- 
plaining!” 

“We adopted Code for a 
good reason, Bruce,” Paul 
Holbertson said. “You should- 
n’t have thrown it out without 
discussing it with the board.” 
“I was given complete au- 
thority to take the steps I 
thought necessary to solve a 
problem. I have solved the 
problem. I did discuss what I 

127 




intended to do with half-a- 
dozen top-level government 
officials, including the head of 
the Board of Censorship. They 
approved the project, and I 
have letters of congratulation 
from them on the way it’s been 
working out. They think TV is 
going to help them solve some 
of their problems. I have 
checked with the Information 
Center, and I find that our 
fourth channel programs have 
taken over the popularity 
lead.” 

“Code,” Paul Holbertson 
said, “is the reason for our 
existence. You seem to have 
missed the point entirely. TV 
has a purpose, and a very im- 
portant purpose.” 

“Code was stupid those 
many years ago when it was 
adopted. Or is it generations 
ago? It was stupid then, and 
now it’s idiotic. With your 
permission I’ll give you my 
reasons for the action I’ve 
taken.” 

Interruptions exploded 
around the table. A vice presi- 
dent put the motion : the posi- 
tion of Vice President and 
Director of Writing Personnel 
to be abolished immediately, 
and Bruce Kalder dismissed. 
Seconded and passed. 

“Thank you,” Kalder said. 
“I regret that our relation- 
ship was so short-lived, but 
for the time that I have been 
connected with Solar Produc- 
tions, I am more grateful than 
I can tell you.” 

He turned away with only 

128 



one regret — June, who sat 
blinking her eyes to keep back 
the tears. 

He had gained much, and 
he had lost much, but one of 
his gains was the. realization 
that there were more impor- 
tant things than his personal 
happiness. 

J UNE left her chair sudden- 
ly, and hurried after him. 
Outside the door, Kalder 
gripped her arm. “I’d like to 
show you something,” he said. 

They caught a company 
swing train, and rode over to 
the Tank. Night was ap- 
proaching in Barney’s do- 
main. The ceiling lights were 
being gradually dimmed. In 
time they would go out, and 
the artificial stars would be 
turned on. 

He led her along a jungle 
trail, and over the hill and 
along the lake. She said, “It 
looks very real, doesn’t it?” 
“It looks like our idea of 
real. But this, and .our idea, 
are both false. You know that, 
don’t you?” 

“This is the first time I’ve 
ever been here. What do the 
writers do?” 

He did not answer. They 
walked down to the lake, and 
removed their sandals. The 
shark fins paraded towards 
them as they waded in. Kal- 
der said, “The trouble is, you 
and I, and the board, and all 
those like us have lost touch 
with the people. The people 
live in a reality that is differ- 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 




ent from ours. Children of the 
wealthy receive the best edu- 
cations, choose the careers 
they want, and look forward 
to a happy and useful lifetime. 
They live in comfort. They 
have clubs, and recreation fa- 
cilities. There is room for 
those things, for a few people. 
The wealthy have a rather 
satisfying existence. 

“But what about the peo- 
ple? Their education is limit- 
ed. There aren’t the facilities, 
and they don’t really need 
any. They’re just hanging 
around and reproducing 
themselves so there will be 
plenty of people when we get 
ready to go back to the sur- 
face. They do a little work, 
they eat and sleep, and the 
rest of the time they watch 
TV. They escape into a fan- 
tasy that doesn’t exist and 
probably will never exist 
again for centuries — a world 
where there are trees, and 
plants, and animals, and riv- 
ers of pure water.” 

“Isn’t it good for them to 
get their minds off the way 
things are?” she said. 

“That’s Code. The Code 
philosophy. The Code tyran- 
ny. It’s horrible. The people 
have given up. They’ve sur- 
rendered completely. When 
we first moved underground 
people must have slaved to 
achieve what we have now. 
They built well. And then, 
when the machines were op- 
erating and living quarters 
prepared, there seemed to be 

THE WELL OF THE DEEP WISH 



nothing for them to do. So 
the film companies were es- 
tablished to give them TV, 
and the companies worked 
hard to provide settings that 
would seem real. The films let 
the people dream of what they 
had lost. They are still dream- 
ing. There are more of us 
now, and the people are 
crowded. But no one plans 
ahead. No one is interested !” 

They waded out of the lake, 
and the shark fins drifted 
away. They dried their feet 
on the synthetic grass, and 
put on the sandals, and 
walked on. 

“What are you going to 
do?” she asked. 

“Form my own company. I 
won’t have any trouble get- 
ting a wire or two. The old 
companies just can’t get 
enough scripts for the ones 
they have. It won’t be easy, 
but I think it will work. We 
won’t have high production 
costs. We can shoot our films 
right out in the corridors, or 
in anyone’s living quarters. 
Scripts won’t give us any 
trouble. Donald is turning out 
five a day. He just can’t stop, 
and some of the others are do- 
ing almost as well.” 

“Isn’t that strange, when 
they couldn’t write according 
to Code?” 

“The first script writers 
wrote about something they 
remembered,” Kalder said. 
“They wrote about a world 
they had lived in — the world 
the way it used to be. And

TWO MINDS ON THE MIND 

Few fields of science have suffered as much from the encumbrances 
of poor definition as hypnosis. We have been much too prone to lump hyp- 
nosis in the same category in which we file our ideas on witches, warlocks 
and wizards; even orthodox science is inclined to approach the subject 
with very much the attitude of an average man investigating a haunted 
house; he doesn’t believe in ghosts, but he definitely hopes he won’t 
meet one!
