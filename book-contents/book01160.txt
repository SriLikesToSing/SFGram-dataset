The Day the Sun Stood Still 

Three Original Novellas of Science Fiction 

By POUL ANDERSON, GORDON R. DICKSON, and 
ROBERT SILVERBERG 



FOREWORD BY LESTER DEL BEY 

Faith wasn’t enough. Maybe 
it should have been, but it 
wasn’t. And when science 
didn’t find any reason to sup- 
pose the world was more 
than atoms and chance, hu- 
manily started slipping back 
into chaos. The world needed 
a sign — scientific proof, the 
only sign it could accept — 
that God lived. Then sud- 
denly, as in biblical times, the 
sign was there: “. for a day 
and a night . the eartn 
moved not around the Sun, 
neither did it rotate.” 

What happened the day the sun stood still? 

'Three outstanding science-fiction authors explore that 
theme, probing the reaction of modem man when con- 
fronted with a miracle, in three entirely difiFerent but equally 
absorbing stories. In doing so, they answer the question posed 
by science-fiction master Lester del Rey in nis foreword; 
What kind of world might exist where the basis of faith is 
replaced by certain knowledge?

Directions (infinite): 

By its “narrowest and hardest" 
definition. Dr. Isaac Asimov informs 
us, “science fiction is that branch of 
literature which deals with the future of 
science and scientists” ^Galaxy, May 
’72). And that is why The Gods 
Themselves, so promising in title and 
opening chapters, ended as such a 
disappointment. Because the future of 
scientists and what they do is not a very 
exciting subject matter for fiction. 
What provides the real provocative 
depths are the implications of what 
scientists do and the reasons for their 
doing it. A nd since it is the chosen goal, 
basically, of scientists to unravel the 
mystery of existence, how can any 
definition of science fiction possibly be 
“narrow” or limiting? 

Thus the Cy Chauvin debate begun in 
Galaxy, March '72, rages on. What is 
science fiction? What are its distin- 
guishing characteristics? Good ques- 
tions, these. And they imply concomi- 
tant questions on the nature of all 
writing, of all art — of life itself. 

The trick, I think, is the articulation 
of what life expresses to us, and of that 
articulation art is the epitome. Science 
fiction, or speculative fiction, is a fore- 



grounded art form, not asking for a 
definition but rather displaying its cre- 
dentials — a license rather than a limit. 
And as science is today our most ef- 
fective vehicle into the unknown, why 
should speculative fiction deny itself a 
foremost position in the exploration of 
the great mystery on its own? 

Some might object that the above can 
only be made acceptable by excluding 
the reality which is the object of 
science. But / submit that the impossi- 
bility of the existence of the square root 
of two does not exclude the existence of 
the number two. / submit that Ein- 
stein’s theory of relativity does not ex- 
clude the continued functioning of the 
universe as men have always known it. 

In speculative fiction lies the greatest 
possibility for reawakening that sense 
of awe of the cosmos, of wonder at the 
priceless gem that is ours for free. 
Where science may seek to deny the 
perpetual mystery that lies always Just 
beyond the range of microscope and te- 
lescope alike, speculative fiction must 
seek it out. It is when U becomes U’ 
and the square root of two entwines 
with the infinite that the mystery buds, 
the universe blossoms and science be- 
comes science fiction. 

We are a society founded on and 
floundering in science and technology. 
We seek to fill a gap the existence of 
which we deny and the denial leaves an 
emptiness. At the bottom of this emp- 
tiness smolders a spark — call it 
whatever you wish. 

The unknown? It seems to me that 
science fiction can hardly avoid the 
challenge of fanning it to flame. 

And why should it want to avoid that 
challenge?

Directions: 

The following has come often to my 
mind, but especially after reading Isaac 
Asimov’s novel and Cy Chauvin's letter 
in the March '72 issue of Galaxy. We 
live in a technological and an in- 
creasingly science-oriented period. 
People are involved in science-fictional 
situations more and more because that 
is the nature of our times. In that re- 
spect perhaps science fiction is today's 
mainstream, or should be. But to be 
good science fiction it must be plau- 
sible, able to suspend disbelief, seem 
real and well within the limits of possi- 
bility. 

I agree somewhat with Cy Chauvin, 
but not entirely. In the case of 
Compton's Chronocules — atom bombs 
may seem like old hat and mainstream 
now, but they still represent a scientific 
discovery. About the only one of 
Chauvin’s choices to exclude as sf I 
agree on is Disch’s The Asian Shore. 
And, of course, besides containing a 
science element a science fiction story 
should be good writing — of this Slow 
Sculpture. I think, was a good example. 

But I couldn't help simply rejoicing 
and shouting Yes! Yes! when I read 
Asimov's The Gods Themselves.

THE NAKED DREAM 



Editor's Column 

With classic application of the best 
principles of science fiction. Frank 
Herbert — in a great new serial. Project 
40, starting in this issue — puts man 
under the same kind of microscope 
man usually reserves for other life 
forms. The novel, in fact, picks up 
where a currently popular movie docu- 
mentary on insect life. The Hellstrom 
Chronicle, leaves off — replacing bugs 
with people. New insights guaranteed. 

And they’re sorely needed. For we 
are never naked to each other. 

Or even, it seems, to the stars. I don’t 
know how you felt when you saw the 
press reproductions (some were 
censored to protect your ignorance) of 
the gold-plated but otherwise nude 
man/woman figures Pioneer 10 is car- 
rying on its timeless journey to in- 
troduce humans to starfolk. My own 
reaction was that they failed to 
represent humans I know — ninety per 
cent of whom are fatter, thinner, taller, 
shorter or otherwise differently shaped 
and none of whom would dream of ap- 
pearing naked or unarmed at least with 
insect spray before an alien life form. 

Now it seems they may also 
represent nobody you know. In a by- 
lined story Wall Street Journal staff 
writer Jerry E. Bishop cites NASA au- 
thority as admitting that while the 
gentleman in Pioneer 10 is depicted as 
anatomically complete the lady is not — 
suggesting that these two are the very 
last humans. 

A prophecy? Or to protect whose ig- 
norance out there?

PART ONE 




Words of the Brood Mother, 
Trova Hellstrom: I welcome 
the day when I will go into the 
vats and become one with all 
of our people, (dated October 
26. 1896) 

T he man with the binoculars 
squirmed forward on his 
stomach through the sun-warmed 
brown grass. There were insects 
in the grass and he did not like in- 
sects, but he ignored them and con- 
centrated on reaching the oak 
shadows at the hillcrest with a 
minimum disturbance of the 
growth that concealed him even 
while it dropped stickers and 
crawling things on his exposed 
skin. 

His narrow face, swarthy and 
deeply seamed, betrayed his age — 
fifty-one years — but the hair, black 



and oily, that poked from beneath 
his khaki sunhat belied these 
years. So did his movements, quick 
and confident. 

At the hillcrest he drew several 
deep breaths while dusting the 
binocular lenses with a clean linen 
handkerchief. He parted the dry 
grass then, focused the binoculars 
and stared through them at the 
farm that filled the valley below the 
hill. The haze of the hot autumn 
afternoon complicated his exami- 
nation as did the binoculars, a pair 
of ten-sixties of special manufac- 
ture. He had trained himself to use 
them the way he fired a rifle — hold 
breath, concentrate on rapid 
scanning with only eye move- 
ments, keeping immobile the ex- 
pensive instrument of glass and 
metal that brought distances into 
such immediate detail. 

The farm under his amplified 
gaze was oddly isolated. The valley 



8 





PROJE 



was about a 

perhaps five hundred yards wide, 
narrowing at the upper end where 
a thin trickle of water spilled 
down a black rock face. The farm 
buildings occupied cleared ground 
on the far side of a narrow stream 
whose meandering, willow-bord- 
ered bed was only a thin reminder 
of its spring affluence. Patches of 
wavering green moss marked the 
stream’s rocks and there were a 
few shallow pools where water 
appeared not to flow at all. 

The buildings sat back from the 
stream. They were a cluster of 
weathered boards and blind glass 
at rustic variance with the neat- 
ness of harvested plantings that ran 
in parallel rows within cleanly 
squared fencelines over the rest of 
the valley. There was the house, its 
basic unit in the old saltbox pat- 
tern, but with two added wings. A 
bay window featured the wing near- 



right of the 
house was a large barn with big 
doors on the second level and an 
upjutting cupola arrangement 
along its ridgeline — no windows 
there, but louvered ventilators 
were spaced along its entire length 
and at the visible end. On the hill 
behind the barn stretched a decay- 
ing feed shed. A smaller building 
could be an old outhouse. An- 
other small wooden structure stood 
higher on the hill behind the farm- 
house, possibly an old pump build- 
ing. Down by the higher main 
fence at the valley’s northern end 
squatted a concrete block about 
twenty feet on a side and with flat 
roof — new pump house was the 
guess, but it looked like a defen- 
sive blockhouse. 

The watcher, whose name was 
Carlos Depeaux, made a mental 
note that the valley fitted the 
descriptions. It was full of default 



9 



messages. No people stirred about 
on the land (although a distinctly 
audible and irritating machinery 
hum issued from the barn). No 
road ran from the north gate to the 
farm buildings (the nearest road, 
a one-way track, reached the valley 
from the north but ended at the 
gate beyond the blockhouse). A 
footpath with narrow indentations, 
apparently from a wheelbarrow, 
stretched from the gate to the 
farmhouse and barn. 

The valley’s sides were steep and 
in places almost craggy with brown 
rock outcroppings at the top of the 
far side. A similar rocky upthrust 
rose about a hundred feet to De- 
peaux’s right. A few animal tracks 
wound their dusty ribbons through 
oak and madrona along the valley 
sides. The black rock of the tiny 
waterfall closed off the southern 
end where a thin cinnamon tracery 
of water spilled into the stream. 
The land undulated away out of 
the valley northward, widening into 
pasture meadows and occasional 
clumps of pine intermingled with 
oak and madrona. Cattle grazed 
in the far distance and, although 
there were no fences immediately 
outside the farm’s barrier, tall 
grass revealed that the cattle did 
not venture too near this valley. 
That, too, accorded with the 
reports. 

H aving satisfied himself that 
the valley still matched its 
descriptions, Depeaux wriggled 
backward behind the crest, found a 
shaded patch beneath an oak. 
There he turned to lie on his back 
and brought a small knapsack into 
a position where he could explore 



its interior. He knew his clothing 
would blend well with the grass, 
but he still hesitated to sit up, pre- 
ferring to wait and listen. The sack 
contained his binocular case, a 
well-thumbed copy of Naming The 
Birds At A Glance, a good 35 mm 
camera with a long lens, two thin 
beef sandwiches wrapped up in 
plastic, an orange and a plastic 
bottle of warm water. 

He brought out a sandwich, lay 
for a moment staring up through 
the oak’s branches, his pale gray 
eyes not really focused on any- 
thing in particular. Once he pulled 
at the black hairs protruding from 
his nostrils. The situation was 
extremely odd, he thought. Here it 
was mid-October and the Agency 
still had not been able to observe 
the farmers in that valley through 
an entire harvest. The crops had 
been harvested, however. That was 
obvious at a glance. Depeaux was 
not a farmer, but he thought he 
recognized the stubby remains of 
corn plantings, although the stalks 
had been removed. 

Why had they cleared away the 
stalks? He wondered. Other 
farms he had seen in the long drive 
to this valley were still littered with 
harvest remains. He wasn’t sure, 
but he thought this was another 
default message in the valley that 
interested his Agency so much. 
The uncertainty, the gap in his 
knowledge — bothered him, how- 
ever, and he made a note to check 
on this. Did they burn the stalks? 

Presently, sensing no watchers 
around him, Depeaux sat up, his 
back against the oak’s bole, ate the 
sandwich and drank some of the 
warm water. The food was the 



10 



GALAXY 



first he had allowed himself since 
before daylight. He decided to 
save the orange and other sand- 
wich for later. His approach to this 
vantage point from the place far 
back in the encroaching pines where 
he had concealed his bicycle had 
been long and slow. The van and 
the stakeout where he had left 
Tymiena were another half-hour’s 
bicycle ride beyond the cache. 
He had decided not to venture 
back before nightfall and knew he 
was going to be very hungry before 
he got back to the van. Not the 
first time on such a job. The 
peculiar nature of this case had 
become increasingly obvious the 
nearer he had come to the farm. 
Well — he’d been warned about 
that. Stubborn persistence had 
kept him pressing forward past 
the imaginary hunger line he 
knew he would have to pass on the 
return. The countryside was much 
more open and empty of conceal- 
ment than he had expected from the 
aerial photos, although Porter’s 
reports had made specific men- 
tion of this. Depeaux had expected 
to approcach from a different 
direction, however, and find his 
own cover. But there had been, 
finally, only the tall brown grass 
to conceal his stalking climb 
across a wide pastureland and up 
to the hill. 

The sandwich finished and half 
his water gone, Depeaux sealed the 
bottle, restored it and the rest of 
the food to his pack. For a moment 
he peered along his backtrail to 
see if anyone had followed. He 
saw no sign of anyone, but was 
unable to put down an uneasy 
feeling that he was watched. The 



lowering sun was picking up his 
trail with a shadowline, too. No 
helping that — the crushed grass 
was a track that could be traced. 

He had driven through the town 
of Fosterville at 3 a. m., curious 
about the sleeping community 
where, he was told, they generally 
refused to answer questions about 
the farm. There had been a new 
motel on the outskirts and Tymiena 
had suggested they spend a night 
there before reconnoitering the 
farm, but Depeaux was playing a 
hunch on this case. What if there 
were watchers from the farm in the 
town to report the arrival of 
strangers. 

The Farm. 

It had been capitalized in all the 
Agency’s reports for some time, 
for quite a while before Porter had 
turned up missing. Depeaux had 
driven on to a turn-off several 
miles below the valley and had 
left Tymiena there shortly before 
dawn. Now he was a birdwatcher, 
but no birds were visible. 

Depeaux returned to the gap in 
the grass and had another look into 
the valley. There had been a mas- 
sacre of Indians here in the late 
1860’s — farmers killing off the 
remnants of a “wild” tribe to 
remove a threat to grazing stock. 
As a marker of that all-but- 
forgotten day the valley had been 
named “Guarded.” According to a 
historical footnote Depeaux had 
located, the original name of the 
valley had been Running Water, 
after the Indian name. Generations 
of white farming, however, had 
depleted the water table and now 
the Running Water did not run 
year round. 



PROJECT 40

As he studied the valley now, 
Depeaux thought about the record 
of human nature carried in such 
names. A casual observer passing 
this way without doing his home- 
work might think the valley had 
achieved jts name because of its 
setting. Guarded Valley was a 
closed-in place with only one real 
avenue of easy access apparent. 
The hillsides were steep. A cliff 
marked the upper end. Only to the 
north did it open out. Appearances 
could be deceptive, though, De- 
peaux reminded himself. He had 
reached his vantage point suc- 
cessfully and his binoculars might 
just as well have been a weapon for 
violence. In a sense they were a 
subtle weapon aimed at the destruc- 
tion of Guarded Valley. 

For Depeaux that pattern of 
destruction had begun when 
Joseph Merrivale, the Agency’s 
operations director, had called 
him in for an assignment con- 
ference. Merrivale, a native of 
Chicago who affected a heavy 
English accent, had begun by 
grinning at Carlos and saying: 
“You may have to waste a few of 
your fellow humans on this one.” 
They all knew, of course, how 
much E>epeaux hated personal 
violence. 

From Hellstrom's Hive Man- 
ual: The significant evolution- 
ary advance that the insects 
achieved more than 100 million 
years ago was the reproductive 
neuter. This fixed the colony 
as the unit of natural selection 
and removed all previous 
limits on the amount of spe- 
cialization (expressed as caste 



differences) a colony could 
tolerate. It is clear that if we 
vertebrates can take the same 
route our individual members 
with their vastly larger brains 
will become incomparably 
superior specialists. No other 
species will be able to stand 
against us, ever — not even the 
old human species from which 
we will evolve our new 
humans. 

T he short man with the de- 
ceptively youthful face listened 
attentively as Merrivale briefed 
Depeaux. It was early on a Mon- 
day morning and the short man, 
whose name was Edward Janvert, 
had been surprised that an assign- 
ment conference could be called 
that early on such brief notice. 
He suspected trouble somewhere 
in the Agency. 

Janvert, who was called Shorty 
by most of his associates and who 
managed to conceal his hatred of 
the name, was only four feet nine 
inches tall and had passed as a 
teenager on more than one Agency 
assignment. The furniture in 
Merrivale’s office was never small 
enough for him, however, and he 
was squirming on a big leather 
chair within a half hour. 

The case was subtle, Janvert 
observed presently, the type he 
had learned to distrust. The target 
was an entomologist, a Dr. Nils 
Hellstrom, and it was clear from 
Merrivale’s careful choice of 
words that Hellstrom had friends 
in high places. There were always 
so many toes around to be avoided 
in this business. You couldn’t 
separate politics from the Agency’s 



12 



GALAXY 



version of a traditional security 
investigation. And the investiga- 
tions inevitably took on economic 
overtones. 

When he had called in Janvert 
Merrivale had said only that it was 
necessary to keep a second team in 
reserve for possible assistance in 
this case. Someone had to be ready 
to step in at a moment’s notice. 

They expect casualties, Janvert 
told himself. 

He glanced covertly at Clovis 
Carr, whose almost boyish figure 
was dwarfed in another of Merri- 
vale’s big wing chairs. Janvert sus- 
pected Merrivale had decorated 
the office to give it the air of an 
expensive British club, something 
to go with his bogus accent. 

Do they know about Clovis and 
me? Janvert’s attention wandered 
under the onslaught of Merrivale’s 
rambling style. To the Agency love 
was a weapon to be used whenever 
it was needed. Janvert tried to hold 
his gaze from Clovis, but he kept 
glancing back at her in spite of 
himself She was short, only a 
half-inch taller than he, a wiry 
brunette with a pert oval face and 
a pale northern complexion that 
burned at the drop of a sunbeam. 
There were times when Janvert felt 
his love for her as an actual 
physical pain. 

Merrivale was describing what 
he called “Hellstrom’s cover,” 
which turned out to be the making 
of documentary films about insects. 

“Deucedly curious, don’t you 
think?” Merrivale asked. 

For not the first time during his 
four years in the Agency Janvert 
wished he were out of it. He had 
come in while a third-year law

Student working the summer as a 
clerk in the Justice Department. 
In that capacity he had found a file 
folder left accidentally on a table 
of his division’s law library. 
Curious, he had glanced into the 
file and had found a highly touchy 
report on a translator in a foreign 
embassy. 

His first reaction at the file’s 
contents had been a kind of sor- 
rowful outrage that governments 
still resorted to such forms of 
espionage. Something about the 
file had told him it represented 
complex operation of his own 
government. 

Janvert had come up through the 
‘campus unrest’ period into the 
study of law. He had seen the law 
at first as a possible way out of the 
world’s many dilemmas, but the 
vision had proved a will-o’-the- 
wisp. Pursuit of the law had 
taken him into that library with its 
damnable misplaced file folder. 
One thing had led inevitably to 
another, just as it always did, 
without a completely defined 
cause-and-effect relationship. The 
immediate thing, however, was 
that he had been caught reading 
the file by its owner. 

What followed was curiously 
low key. There had been a period 
of pressures, some subtle and some 
not quite subtle, designed to 
recruit him into the Agency which 
had produced that file. Janvert 
came from a good family, they ex- 
plained. His father was an impor- 
tant small businessman (owner- 
operator of a small-town hardware 
store). At first the recruitment had 
been vaguely amusing. 

Then the pay offers (plus ex- 



14 



GALAXY 



penses) had climbed embarrass- 
ingly high and he had begun to 
wonder. Next had come startling 
praise for his abilities and aptitudes, 
which Janvert had suspected the 
Agency invented on the spur of the 
moment — he had had difficulty 
seeing himself in their descrip- 
tions. 

Finally the gloves had come off. 
He had been told pointedly that 
he might find other government 
employment difficult to obtain. 
This had almost put his back up, 
because it was common know- 
ledge that he had set his sights on 
the Justice Department. Tn the end 
he had said he would try it for a 
few years if he could continue his 
law education. By that time he 
had been dealing with the Chiefs 
right hand man, Dzule Peruge, and 
Peruge had evinced profound de- 
light at this prospect. 

“The Agency needs men with 
legal training,” Peruge had said. 
“We need them desperately at 
times.” 

Peruge’s next words had startled 
Janvert. 

“Has anyone ever told you that 
you could pass for a teenager? 
That could be very useful at times, 
especially for someone with legal 
training.” This last had come out 
with all of the overtones of an 
afterthought. 

The facts were that Janvert had 
always been kept too busy to 
complete his valuable legal train- 
ing. Maybe next year. Shorty. 
You can see for yourself how 
crucial your present case is. Now, 
I want you and Clovis . 

That had been how he had first 
met Clovis, who also possessed that 



useful appearance of youth. Some- 
times she had been his sister. At 
other times they had been runaway 
lovers whose parents “didn’t 
understand.” 

The realization had come rather 
slowly to Janvert that the file he 
had found and read was more 
sensitive than he had imagined 
and that a probable alternative to 
his joining the Agency had been a 
markerless grave in some southern 
swamp. He had never participated 
in a swamping, as Agency old 
timers put it, but he knew for a fact 
that they occurred. 

That was how it was in the 
Agency, he learned. 

The Agency. 

N O ONE ever called it any- 
thing else. The Agency’s 
economic operations — the spying 
and other forms of snooping — 
only confirmed Janvert’s early 
cynicism. He saw the world 
without masks, telling himself 
that the great mass of his fellows 
had no realization whatsoever 
that they already lived in what 
was, for all intents and purposes, 
a police state. This had been in- 
evitable from the formation of the 
first police state that achieved 
any degree of world power. The 
only apparent way to oppose the 
trend was by pitting it against 
itself It was a condition which 
fostered its mimic forces on all 
sides (so Clovis Carr and Edward 
Janvert agreed). Everything in the 
society they saw took on police- 
state character. Janvert said it: 
This is the time of the police 
states. 

They made this a tenet of their 



PROJECT 40 



15 



pact to leave the Agency together “Porter’s reasonably certain they 
at the first opportunity. That their didn’t kill her,’’ Merrivale said, 
feelings for each other and the pact “They just took her back inside 
were dangerous, they had no that barn which we are told — is 
doubts. To leave the Agency the main studio for Hellstrom’s 
would require new identities and a movie operation.’’ 



subsequervt life of obscurity whose 
nature they understood all too 
well. Agents left their service 
through death in action or a care- 
fully guarded retirement — or they 
simply disappeared and somehow 
all of their fellows got the message 
not to ask questions. The most 
persistent retirement rumor in the 
Agency mentioned a carefully 
supervised rest home no one 
located with precise geography. 
Some said northern Minnesota. 
The story described high fences, 
guards, dogs, golf, tennis, swim- 
ming, splendid fishing on an 
enclosed lake, posh private cabins 
for guests — and even quarters for 
married couples, but no children. 
Having children in this business 
was considered equal to a death 
sentence. 

Both Carr and Jan vert agreed 
they wanted children. Escape would 
have to occur while they were over- 
seas together, they decided. 
Forged papers, new faces, money, 
the requisite language facility — 
all the physical necessities were 
within their reach except one: the 
opportunity. And never once did 
they suspect adolescent fantasy in 
such dreams or in the work that 
occupied their lives. They would 
escape— some day. 

Depeaux was objecting to some- 
thing in Merrivale’s briefing now. 
Janvert tried to pick up the thread 
— something about a young woman 
trying to escape from the farm. 



II 

From the Agency report on 
Project 40: The sheaf of papers 
was dropped from a folder by a 
man identified as a Hellstrom 
aide. The incident occurred in 
the MIT main library early 
last March as explained in the 
covering notes. The label 
PROJECT 40 was at the top of 
each page. From an examina- 
tion of the notes and diagrams 
(see enclosure A), our experts 
postulate developmental plans 
for what they describe as “a 
toroidal field disrupter.” This 
is explained as an electron (or 
particle) pump capable of in- 
fluencing physical matter at a 
distance. The papers are un- 
fortunately incomplete. No 
definite line of development 
can be determined from them, 
although our own laboratories 
are exploring the provocative 
implications. It seems obvious, 
however, that someone in the 
Hellstrom organization is at 
work on an operational proto- 
type. We cannot be certain 1) 
whether it will work or 2) to 
what use it will be put if it 
works. However, in view of Dr. 
Zinstrom’s report (see en- 
closure G) we must assume the 
worst. Zinstrom assures us 
privately that the theory be- 
hind such a development is

sound and that a toroidal 
field disrupter large enough, 
amplified enough to set to 
the correct resonance could 
shatter the Earth’s crust with 
disastrous consequences for 
all life on our planet. 

is really a plum of a 
X case we’re handing to 
Carlos,” Merrivale said. He 
touched his upper lip, brushing an 
imaginary mustache. 

Carr, who was seated slightly 
behind Depeaux and facing Merri- 
vale, noted the flush of sudden red 
at Depeaux’s neck. He didn’t like 
that obvious, pandering statement. 
The morning sun was shining 
through the window to Merrivale’s 
right, reflecting from the desk. 
The yellow-brown underlight im- 
parted a saturnine cast to the 
operations chiefs face. 

“That movie company front has 
got Peruge’s wind up, I must say,” 
Merrivale said. (Depeaux actually 
shuddered.) 

Carr coughed to conceal a sud- 
den hysterical desire to laugh aloud. 

“Under the circumstances, we 
don’t dare go in and root them out, 
as I’m sure you can understand,” 
Merrivale said. “Not enough 
evidence in our kip. Your job, 
that. This movie front does offer 
one of our most promising points 
of entry, however.” 

“What’s the subject matter of 
this film?” Janvert asked. 

They all turned to look at him 
and Carr wondered why Eddie had 
interrupted. He seldom did that 
sort of thing casually. Was he 
fishing for some information be- 
hind Merrivale’s briefing? 



“I thought I said.” Merrivale 
sniffed. “Insects. They’re doing a 
film about bloody insects. A bit 
of a surprise, that, when Peruge 
first mentioned it. I confess my 
own first guess was that they were 
making these unsavory sex films 
and — ah — blackmailing someone 
in a sensitive position.” 

Depeaux, sweating under a pro- 
found aversion to Merrivale’s 
bogus accent and manner, 
squirmed in his chair, resenting 
the interruption. Get on with it! 
he thought. 

“I’m not sure I understand the 
sensitive conditions around Hell- 
strom’s operation,” Janvert said. 
“I thought the film would supply a 
clue.” 

Merrivale sighed. Bloody nit- 
picker. He said, “Hellstrom is 
something of a madman on the 
subject of ecology. I’m sure you 
know how politically sensitive that 
area is. There’s also the fact that 
he is employed as a consultant by 
several — I repeat, several — persons 
of extremely powerful influence. 
I could name one Senator and at 
least three Congressmen. If we 
were to move frontally against 
Hellstrom, I’m sure the repercus- 
sions would be severe.” 

“Ecology, eh?” Depeaux said, 
trying to get Merrivale back on 
track. 

“Yes, ecology.” Merrivale made 
the word sound as though he 
wanted it to rhyme with sodomy. 
“Man has access to considerable 
sums of money, too, and we’d like 
to know about that.” 

Depeaux nodded, said, “Let’s 
get back to that valley.” 

“Yes, yes indeed,” Merrivale 



PROJECT 40

agreed. “You’ve all seen the map. 
This little valley’s been in Hell- 
strom’s family since his grand- 
mother’s day. Trova Hellstrom, 
pioneer, widow, that sort of thing.’’ 
Janvert rubbed a hand across his 
eyes. He wqs sure from Merrivale’s 
description of Trova Hellstrom 
that the intended picture was of a 
tiny “widow woman’’ fighting off 
attacking redskins from a blazing 
log cabin, her brats forming a 
bucket brigade behind her. The 
man was unbelievable. 

“Here’s the map,” Merrivale 
said, extracting it from the papers 
on his desk. “Southeastern Ore- 
gon, right here.” He touched the 
map with a finger. “Guarded 
Valley. The closest civilization is 
this town here with the unlikely 
appellation of Fosterville.” His 
finger moved to the unlikely town. 

C ARR wondered: IVky an un- 
likely name? She glanced 
covertly at Janvert, but he was 
examining the palm of his right 
hand as though he had just found 
something fascinating'in it. 

“And they do all of their filming 
in this valley?” Depeaux asked. 

“Oh, no,” Merrivale protested. 
“My God, Carlos, didn’t you read 
enclosures R through W?” 

“There were no such enclosures 
in my file,” Depeaux said. 

“Bloody hell!” Merrivale said. 
“Sometimes, I wonder how we 
ever get anything done correctly 
in this establishment. Very well. 
I’ll give you mine. Briefly, Hell- 
strom and his camera crews and 
whatnot have been all over the 
bloody world: Kenya, Brazil, 

Southeast Asia, India — it’s all in 



here.” He tapped the papers on 
his desk. “You can see for yourself 
later.” 

“And this Project Forty,” De- 
peaux prompted. 

“That’s what attracted our at- 
tention,” Merrivale explained. 
“The pertinent papers were copied 
and the originals returned to where 
they were found. The Hellstrom 
aide subsequently returned for his 
papers, found them where he ex- 
pected, took them and departed. 
Their significance was not under- 
stood at the time. Purely routine. 
Our man on the library staff was 
curious, no more, but our curiosity 
became increasingly intense as the 
papers were bounc^ upstairs. Un- 
fortunately we’ve not had the op- 
portunity of observing this 
particular Hellstrom aide since 
that moment. He apparently is 
keeping to the farm. It is our belief, 
however, that Hellstrom is un- 
aware that we know about his little 
project.” 

“The speculation seems a little 
science fictiony — perhaps a little 
fantastic,” Depeaux said. 

Janvert nodded his agreement. 
Were those explicit suspicions the 
real reason the Agency was prying 
into Hellstrom’s affairs? Or was 
it possible that Hellstrom was 
merely developing a product that 
threatened one of the groups that 
actually paid most of the Agency’s 
expenses? You never knew in this 
business. 

“Haven’t I heard of this Hell- 
strom before?” Carr asked. “Isn’t 
he the entomologist who came out 
against DDT when — ” 

“That’s the chap,” Merrivale 
said. “Pure fanatic. Now, here’s 



18 



GALAXY 



the farmstead plan, Carlos.” 

So much for my question, Carr 
thought. She curled her legs under 
her in the wing chair, glanced 
openly at Janvert, who returned her 
stare with a grin. He’s just been 
playing with Merrivale, she real- 
ized, and he thinks I'm in the 
game. 

M errivale had a blue- 
print map on his desk now, 
was unfolding it, indicating fea- 
tures on it with his long, sensitive 
fingers. “Barn here— outbuildings 
— main house. We have every rea- 
son to believe, as those reports 
indicate, that the barn is Hell- 
strom’s studio. Curious concrete 
structure here near the entrance 
gate. Can’t say what purpose it 
serves. Your job to find out.” 

“And you don’t want us to go 
right in, nose around,” Depeaux 
said. He frowned at the blueprint 
map. This decision puzzled him. 
“The young woman who tried to 
get away — ” 

“Yes, that was February twen- 
tieth last,” Merrivale said. 
“Porter saw her run from the 
barn. She got as far as the north 
gate here when she was appre- 
hended by two men who came 
upon her from beyond the fence. 
Their point of origin was not 
determined. They did, however, 
return her to the barn-studio.” 
“Porter’s account says these 
people weren’t wearing any 
clothes,” Depeaux said. “It seems 
to me that a report to the authori- 
ties giving a description of — ” 

“And we’d have had to explain 
why we were there, send our one 
man up against numerous Hell- 



strom accomplices, all of this in 
the presence of the “new morality” 
that permeates this society.” 

You damned hypocrite, Carr 
thought. You know how the 
Agency uses sex for its own pur- 
poses. 

Janvert leaned forward in his 
chair. “Merrivale, you’re holding 
something back in this case. I 
want to know what it is. We have 
Porter’s report, but he’s not here 
to amplify it. Is Porter available?” 
He sat back. “A simple yes or no 
will suffice.” 

That's a dangerous tack to take, 
Eddie, Carr thought. She watched 
Merrivale intently to measure his 
response. 

“1 can’t say 1 care for your tone. 
Shorty,” Merrivale said. 

Depeaux leaned back, put a hand 
over his eyes. 

“And I can’t say 1 care for your 
secrecy,” Janvert said. “We would 
like to know the things that are 
not in these reports.” 

Depeaux dropped his hand, 
nodded. Yes, there were some 
things about this case . 

“Impatience is not seemly in 
good agents,” Merrivale said. 
“However, I can understand your 
curiosity and the ‘need-to-know’ 
rule has not been applied in this 
case. Peruge was specific on that. 
What has our wind up, as it were, 
is not just this Project Forty thing, 
but the accumulation of items, the 
indications that Hellstrom’s film 
activities are actually — ” he pro- 
nounced it exshooly and once more 
for emphasis — “actually a cover for 
serious and highly subversive politi- 
cal activities.” 

Bullshit, Janvert thought. 



PROJECT 40 



19 



“How serious?” Carr asked. 
“Well — Hellstrom has been 
nosing around the Nevada atomic 
testing area. He conducts entomo- 
logical researches, as well, you see. 
His films are offered under the 
guise of documentary productions. 
He has ha^ atomic materials for 
his so-called researches and — ” 
“Why so-called?” Janvert 
asked. “Isn’t it possible he's just 
what he — ” 

“Impossible.” Merrivale snorted. 
“Look, it’s really all in the reports 
here. Observe especially the indi- 
cations that Hellstrom and his 
people may be interested in form- 
ing some sort of new communal 
society. It’s quite provocative. He 
and his film crew live that sort of

themselves, clubby. And their 
preoccupation with the emerging 
African nations, the numerous 
visits to the Nevada testing area, 
the ecology thing with its highly 
inflammatory nature, the — ” 
“Communist?” Carr interrupted. 
“It’s — ah — possible.” 

Janvert asked, “Where’s Porter?” 
“That — ah — ” Merrivale pulled 
at his chin. “That’s a bit sticky. 
I’m sure you understand the 
delicacy of our position in all of—” 
“I don’t understand it,” Janvert 
said. “What’s happened to him?” 
“That’s one of the things we 
hope Carlos can ascertain,” 
Merrivale said. 

Depeaux turned a speculative 
look on Janvert, returned his at- 
tention to Merrivale, who had 
sunk back into apparent concen- 
tration upon the blueprint map. 

“Porter’s missing?” Depeaux 
asked. 



“Somewhere around this farm,” 
Merrivale said. He looked up as 
though he were just noticing 
Depeaux. “Presumably.” 

From recorded comments 
of Brood Mother Trova Hell- 
strom: Some threat is good 
for a species. It tends to stimu- 
late breeding, to raise the level 
of awareness. Too much, how- 
ever, can have a stupefying 
effect. It is one of the tasks of 
Hive leadership to adjust the 
level of stimulating threat. 

AS THE sun moved lower be- 
J\. hind him and to the right of 
his position on the hill above 
Guarded Valley, Depeaux took 
care that the light did not outline 
him. There were both advantages 
and disadvantages in the slanting 
rays. They tended to throw some 
details of the farm into relief — the 
fence lines, the paths on the op- 
posite hillside, the weathered 
boards on the barn’s western face. 

He still had not seen one sign of 
human activity outside the build- 
ings and no sure indication of 
humans within them. The irritat- 
ing hum continued to issue from 
the barn and Depeaux had ex- 
hausted his speculations on what it 
might be. He had opted tentatively 
for air-conditioning and wished he 
could enjoy that relief from the 
hot afternoon in the dusty grass. 

A long, cold drink — that’s what 
/ need, he told himself. 

The fact that the farm fitted 
all the reports and the descriptions 
(including Porter’s) did not really 
say anything for it. 

Depeaux scanned the valley once 



20 



GALAXY 



more through his binoculars. There 
was a peculiar waiting air to the 
emptiness of the place, as though 
forces were being marshaled to fill 
the farm with life. 

What did Hellstrom do with his 
farm’s products? Depeaux won- 
dered. Why was the entire area so 
devoid of human activity? He had 
seen no vacationers or picnickers 
on the dirt road to the valley— 
although the area seemed attractive 
enough. Why were the Fosterville 
residents so close-mouthed about 
Hellstrom’s farm? Porter had been 
intrigued by this, too. This was a 
hunting area, but Depeaux had 
seen no deer sign and not one 
hunter. The stream obviously held 
no attraction for fishermen. 

A Steller’s jay flapped into the 
tree behind Depeaux, called once 
with its raucous voice, then flew 
across the valley into the trees of 
the far slope. 

Depeaux watched the bird's 
flight with peculiar interest, realiz- 
ing it was the first higher life form 
he had seen in Hellstrom’s valley. 
One damned jay! That was some 
record for a day’s work. But he 
supposed to be a birdwatcher, 
wasn’t he? Just a simple little 
old vacationer, a traveling sales- 
man for the Blue Devil Fireworks 
Corporation of Baltimore, Mary- 
land. He sighed, worked his way 
back to the oak’s shade. He had 
studied the maps, the aerial photo- 
graphs. Porter’s descriptions, all 
the accumulated reports. Every 
detail had been committed to 
memory. He scanned his backtrail 
with the binoculars. Nothing 
moved in the tall grass of the open 
area or in the trees beyond it. 



Nothing. The oddity of this be- 
came increasingly demanding of 
his attention. 

One damned jay? 

It had been a thing long inserting 
itself into his awareness, but now 
he focused upon it to the exclusion 
of all other considerations. One 
bird. It was as though animal life 
had been swept away from the 
region around Guarded Valley. 
Why hadn’t Porter mentioned 
that? And the grazing cattle down 
there to the north toward Foster- 
ville. No fence kept them from ap- 
proaching the farm, but they kept 
their distance. 

Why? 

In that instant Depeaux recog- 
nized what it was that had made 
the farm’s fields appear so strange 
to him. 

They were clean. 

Those fields had not been har- 
vested. They had been swept clean 
of every stalk, every leaf, every 
twig. An orchard occupied the 
upper reaches of the valley and 
Depeaux crawled back to study it 
through the binoculars. There were 
no bits of rotten fruit on the 
ground, no culls, no leaves or limbs 
— nothing. 

Clean. 

But the tall grass remained all 
around on the perimeter hills. 

Hellstrom’s own addenda to 
the dietary notes: The key 
workers must, of course, take 
the supplemental leader-foods 
without fail, but it is equally 
important that they keep up 
their intake from the vats. It 
is here that we get the markers 
that maintain our awareness of 



PROJECT 40 



21 



mutual identity. Without this 
chemical sameness, which the 
vats provide us, we will be- 
come like those Outside; 
isolated, alone, drifting with- 
out purpose. 



B y late afternoon Depeaux 
had become almost obsessed 
with the desire to find something 
animal and alive in the valley. But 
nothing stirred there and the sun 
had moved several long notches 
toward the horizon. 

Perhaps another vantage 
point . 

The longer he stayed on the hill 
above the farm, the less he liked 
his cover story. Birdwatcher, 
indeed! Why hadn’t Porter men- 
tioned the absence of animal life? 
Insects, of course: the grass was 
alive with them, crawling, buzzing, 
flitting. 

Depeaux slid and crawled 
away from the crest, rose to his 
knees. His back ached from all of 
the unnatural movement. Grass 
burrs had invaded his collar, were 
under his belt, under his stockings, 
up his sleeves. He managed a 
smile, half grimace, at his own 
discomfort, could almost hear 
Merrivale commenting: "Part of 
the price you pay for engaging in 
this line of work, old bean." 

Son of a bitch! 

Porter’s careful reports had in- 
dicated no guards posted outside 
the farm’s perimeter, but that was 
just one man’s account. Depeaux 
asked himself how he felt about 
his position in the open under the 
oak. You stayed alive in this busi- 
ness by ultimately trusting only 



your own senses — and Porter was 
missing. The fact represented an 
important piece of information. It 
could be innocent or ominous, but 
it was safer to believe the worst. At 
the worst. Porter was dead and the 
people of Hellstrom’s farm were 
responsible. Merrivale believed 
this. He had made that clear and 
the secretive bastard could have 
information to confirm it without 
any of his agents being the wiser. 

You will proceed with the utmost 
caution, keeping in mind at every 
juncture our need to determine 
precisely what has happened to 
Porter. 

The son of a bitch probably 
already knows what has happened, 
Depeaux thought. 

Something about the one-pointed 
emptiness of the region spoke of 
hidden dangers. Depeaux reminded 
himself that agents who leaned too 
heavily on the reports of others 
often ended up dead, sometimes in 
painful and ugly fashion. What was 
it about this place? 

He swept his gaze around his 
backtrail, saw no sign of move- 
ment or watching eyes. A glance at 
his watch told him he had slightly 
more than two hours before sun- 
set. Time to get to the head of the 
valley then and scan the length of 
it. 

Bending tow at the waist, De- 
peaux got to his feet and, in a 
crouching trot, moved swiftly to- 
ward the south below the conceal- 
ing ridge. His breathing deepened 
easily with the effort and he 
thought for a moment that he 
wasn’t in such bad condition for a 
man of fifty-one. Swimming and 
long walks weren’t the worst recipe 



22 



GALAXY 



in the world — and he wished he 
were swimming that instant. It 
was dry and hot under the ridge. 
The grass was full of nose-tickling 
dust. Desire for a swim did not 
bother him greatly. Such wishes 
had come often in the sixteen 
years since he had moved up from 
an ofTice clerk in the Agency. The 
fleeting desire to be elsewhere he 
usually passed off as an uncon- 
scious recognition of danger, but 
sometimes it could be attributed 
to no more than bodily discomfort. 

When he had been a mere clerk 
in the Baltimore office Depeaux 
had enjoyed his daydreams about 
working as an agent. He had filed 
“final reports” on agents “wasted 
in action” and had told himself: 
If ever 1 get to be an agent 1 shall 
be extremely cautious. The promise 
had not been hard to keep. He 
was by nature careful and pain- 
staking — “the perfect clerk,” some 
of his fellows carped. But it was 
painstaking care that had led him 
to commit the farm and its sur- 
roundings to memory, to note 
possible cover (little enough of 
that!) and the game trails through 
the tall grass indicated on aerial 
photos. 

Game trails but no visible game 
sign, he reminded himself What 
kind of game ran these paths? It 
was another note on his increasing 
sense of caution. 

Depeaux had once overheard 
Merrivale commenting to another 
agent: The trouble with Carlos is 
he plays for survival. 

As though old Jollyvale didn’t 
do the same, Depeaux told himself 
The man hadn’t reached his pre- 
sent eminence as operations 



director without an eye for the 
mainline. 

D epeaux could hear the faint 
trickling of the waterfall at 
the valley’s upper end. A clump of 
madronas stood at the invisible 
line on Depeaux’s mental map, 
marking the northernmost reach 
of Hellstrom’s valley. Depeaux 
paused in their shade and made 
another survey of his surroundings, 
paying special attention to his own 
backtrail. Something about that 
open area — nothing moved in it, 
but Depeaux made a decision then 
and there to wait for darkness to 
cover his return across that space. 

Thus far it had not been too bad 
a go, he told himself Just that 
faintly disquieting sense of an 
unknown danger. The second 
examination of the valley from 
this upper vantage point should 
not take too long. Perhaps he 
might reconsider and go back by 
daylight to the bicycle and an early 
check-in with Tymiena at the van. 
Perhaps. That first decision to 
wait for darkness had gone deeply 
into him, though. 

Play it safe, he reminded him- 
self Play for survival. 

He turned left briskly, unslung 
his binoculars and slipped up 
through a stand of oak and ma- 
drona to a clump of oily green 
bushes behind the rock face of the 
valley’s upper limit. The tinkling 
waterfall was quite noisy through 
the undergrowth. At the bushes 
Depeaux dropped to all fours, 
tucking the binoculars under his 
shirt and cinching the pack tightly 
against his right side. He went 
through the now familiar stalking 



PROJECT 40 



23 



crawl then, turning partly onto his 
left side to protect the binoculars 
and keep the pack off the ground. 
The bushes ended presently in a 
short rock lip that exposed a length- 
wise view of Guarded Valley. 

As he brought out the bino- 
culars Depeaux wondered idly 
where the Indians had been 
slaughtered. The noise of the 
waterfall was quite loud about 
fifty feet to his right. He rested on 
his elbows, brought up the bin- 
oculars. 

The farm buildings were farther 
away from him this time and the 
large barn-studio concealed all 
but the western wing of the house. 
A crooked stretch of stream was 
clearly visible from this new vant- 
age. Its surface remained mirror 
calm, as though stagnant, reflect- 
ing the trees and brush at its verge. 
The view opened up at the valley’s 
far end, revealing the rolling 
grasslands and clumps of trees, 
the patches of distant cattle. 

Why wouldn’t the cattle venture 
into the rich grass closer to the 
end of the valley? Nothing visible 
was keeping them away; no fence, 
no ditch — nothing. 

D epeaux became aware of a 
vehicle moving in a dust 
cloud far off beyond the cattle. 
That was the narrow track he and 
Tymiena had taken. Who was 
coming down there? Would they 
see the camper? Tym would be 
out there with her paints, drawing 
pictures of the stupid landscape, of 
course, but still . Depeaux 
focused his binoculars on the dust, 
presently made out a large covered 
truck. It was following the crazy 



meander track toward the valley 
and moving fast. He tried to locate 
Tymiena, but the hill to his left 
blocked off that vista and the 
camper sat in tree shade along a 
side road. The oncoming truck 
might not pass close enough to see 
her. It made no difference anyway, 
he told himself. A strange excite- 
ment gripped him. 

He brought his attention back to 
the farm buildings. Surely some- 
one would come out to greet the 
truck. He would get his first look at 
the occupants of this odd place. He 
studied the scene intently. 

Nothing moved within the valley. 

They must hear the truck. He 
could hear it himself even from this 
greater distance and above the 
waterfall’s intrusion. 

Where were the farm’s occu- 
pants? 

The binoculars had collected dust 
again. Depeaux paused to reflect 
on the situation while he applied 
the linen cloth once more to the 
lenses. He knew it might appear 
ridiculous, but the absence of sur- 
face activity in the presence of so 
much evidence that people carried 
on an active life here filled him with 
disquiet. It wasn’t natural! Every- 
thing was so damned motionless 
in the valley. He experienced the 
skin-creeping sensation of being 
watched by countless eyes. When 
he rolled over and peered back 
through the brush he could see 
not one moving thing. Why did 
he expect (trouble from these condi- 
tions? He did, though, and his 
inability to explain the expectation 
filled him with irritation. What 
were they hiding here? 

Despite Merrivale’s Sittempts 



24 



GALAXY 



to present this case as a plum for 
the chosen agent, Depeaux had 
tasted the oddness of it from the 
beginning. Shorty Janvert obvi- 
ously had shared that sense of 
something profoundly wrong. 
This thing was sour! And it was 
not the sourness of green fruit and 
easy pickings. It was a prickling of 
the senses that came from know- 
ledge of something overripe and 
rotten, of something that had 
stewed too long in its own juices. 

The truck was just beyond the 
valley now, making its final climb 
up the easy slope to the north 
fence. Depeaux brought his binocu- 
lars to bear on it once more, saw 
two white-clad figures in the cab. 
They were visible only dimly 
through sun reflections on the 
windshield. And still no one came 
from the farm buildings. 

The truck turned close to the . 
north fence, revealing large words 
on its flat white side: N. hell- 
STROM, INC. The machine made 
a wide turn until it was heading 
away from the farm, stopped and 
backed up to the gate. Two blond 
young men emerged from the cab. 
They trotted briskly to the rear, 
dropped a gate that extended to a 
ramp with rollers. They clambered 
into the open cave of the bed, slid a 
tall yellow and gray box from the 
shadows there. The box appeared 
heavy from the way they strained 
at it. They tipped it onto the gate’s 
rollers, let it slide swiftly to a 
jolting, dusty stop on the ground. 

Depeaux watched the whole 
operation intently. What the hell 
was in that box? It was big enough 
for a coffin. 

The men hopped down, strained 



against the box until they brought 
it teeterinjg upright. They walked 
it to a position clear of the tailgate, 
closed the truck, got back into the 
cab and drove away. 

The box remained about ten 
feet outside the north gate. 

Depeaux examined the surface 
of the box through his binoculars. 
It was taller than the men from 
the truck and it was heavy. It 
appeared to be made of wood and 
was bound by what seemed to be 
flat metal straps that ran around 
it from top to bottom. 

A delivery, Depeaux mused. 
What in hell could be delivered to 
this farm in a box that shape? 

Hellstrom had his own truck to 
bring things to the farm, but he 
didn’t worry about his deliveries 
waiting in the sun outside his gate. 
There might be nothing unusual 
about that, on the surface of it. 
The Agency’s dossier carried con- 
siderable information about Hell- 
strom’s film company. That was 
the N. Hellstrom, Inc. Hellstrom 
was both owner and manager. He 
made documentary films about 
insects. Sometimes Hellstrom’s 
film efforts were incorporated into 
quite substantial productions that 
were distributed through other 
companies in Hollywood and New 
York. It was all easily explained 
until you sat on this hillside and 
watched the operation, as Depeaux 
was doing now and as Porter had 
done before him. What had become 
of Porter? And why wouldn’t 
Merrivale permit a straightforward 
missing-person investigation? 

There was something else about 
Hellstrom’s operation. 

His un-operation.

From the Hive Manual: The

T he conference room held 
an air of detached waiting 
as Dzule Peruge strode into it 
and took the Chiefs chair at the 
head of the long table. He glanced 
at his wristwatch as he put his 
briefcase on the table. Fourteen 
after five p.m. In spite of the day’s 
being Sunday they were all present 
— all the important men and the 
one woman who shared responsi- 
bility for the Agency. 

Without any of the usual prepar- 
ations Peruge sat down, said, “I’ve 
had an extremely trying day. To 
cap it, the Chief called me just 
two hours ago and told me 1 would 
have to deliver his report to you. 
He had to take care of some ques- 
tions from Upstairs. That, of 
course, took priority.” 

He swept his gaze around the 
room, it was a quiet and cushioned 
place, this penthouse boardroom. 
Gray curtains covered the double 
windows on the north side, giving 
the sun’s afternoon rays a feeling 



of cool, underwater light as they 
filtered through to the dark, 
polished wood of the tabletop. 

There were some impatient 
coughs around the table, but 
Peruge’s listeners took the replace- 
ment without objection. 

He squared the briefcase in front 
of him, extracted its contents — 
three thin folders. He said, “You’ve 
all seen the Hellstrom file. The 
Chief tells me he circulated it 
three weeks ago. You will be glad 
to know that we have now cracked 
the code on page eleven of the 
original sheaf. It was a rather inter- 
esting one, based on a four-unit 
configuration our people tell me 
was derived from the DNA code. 
Very ingenious.” 

He cleared his throat, pulled 
one thin sheet from the top folder, 
scanned it. “Again, this refers to 
Project Forty, but this time dis- 
tinctly in terms of a weapon. The 
exact words are: ’. a sting that 
will make our workers supreme 
over the entire world.’ Very 
suggestive.” 

A man down the table on 
Peruge’s left said, “Poppycock! 
This Hellstrom produces movies. 
That could be a dramatic piece of 
business for a film.” 

“There is more,” Peruge said. 
“It includes partial instructions 
for an exchange circuit which our 
man at Westinghouse assures us 
is real. He was quite excited by 
the implications. He called it 
‘another key to the puzzle.’ He 
concedes that it is an incomplete 
key — where the circuit would fit 
in the larger scheme is not indi- 
cated. However, there was one 
more item in the coded section.” 



26 



GALAXY 



Peruge paused for effect, glanced 
once around the table. Then- 
“The message is quite direct. It 
instructs the bearer of the subject 
papers to transmit his future re- 
ports through a man in Washing- 
ton, D.C. The man is named. He 
is the Senator whose activities we 
have come to question.” 

Peruge wanted to laugh. Their 
reaction was precisely what the 
Chief had said it would be. He had 
their undivided attention, a thing 
seldom granted in this room of 
giants. 

The man directly at his left 
asked, “No doubt of that?” 

“None whatsoever.” 

From Dzule Peruge's original 
report on Joseph Merrivale: 
Subject has no detectable 
inhibiting emotions of warmth 
toward his fellows, but counter- 
feits these reactions well. His 
administrative abilities are 
adequate for the tasks we have 
in mind, but he lacks qualities 
of initiative and daring. He is 
exactly what we had in mind, 
a man who can keep his divi- 
sion running smoothly and can, 
if directed, send his people to 
their deaths without a qualm. 
Promotion recommended. 

AS HE left the conference Peruge 
allowed himself a small 
sense of triumph. There had been 
a few touchy moments with that 
bitch, but he had managed them 
well, all things considered. He 
still could not understand why they 
had ever allowed a woman onto 
that board. 

Rain, when he reached the 



street, was freshening the evening 
air, but also imparting a smell of 
wet dust which Peruge particularly 
disliked. He hailed a cab. 

The driver, as luck would have 
it, was a woman. Peruge settled 
back into the seat with a sigh of 
resignation, said. “Take me to the 
Statler.” 

There was no telling where 
women would intrude next, he 
thought. They were essentially 
frail things and should not be 
allowed into these occupations. 
His judgment was based on obser- 
vations of his mother, who had gone 
through life torn by conflicting 
attitudes toward her ancestry and 
toward the demands of her sex. 
She had Black, Cherokee, Portu- 
guese and Cajun ancestors that 
she knew about. Sometimes she 
had been proud of her outgait 
progenitors. Never forget, boy, 
that your ancestors were here 
before the first white thief set foot 
on these shores. At other times 
she would remind him: We were 
sailors under Henry the Navigator 
when most sailors never came 
back from a long voyage. But she 
could temper these outbursts of 
bitter pride with cautious warnings: 
Dzule, you look white enough for 
nobody ever to know about the 
niggers in our blood. Play the white 
game, boy — that's the only way to 
win in this world. 

He had won the field this day, 
no doubt about that. The bitch of 
the board room had cross- 
examined him about Hellstrom’s 
corporate activities, trying to 
catch him in a contradiction. The 
Chief had warned him about that. 
They'll want to take advantage of 



PROJECT 40

you and check up on the Agency. 
I’m trusting you to give them blow 
for blow. That was the Chief for 
you — like a father to those he 
trusted. 

Peruge had never known his own 
father, who had been only the first 
in a long fine of men who partook 
of Juanita Peruge’s favors. Her 
family name had been Brown, a 
commonplace easily discarded 
for the more mysterious Peruge. 
The father had stayed with Juanita 
long enough to name the infant 
Dzule for a half-remembered 
uncle. Then he had gone on a com- 
mercial fishing voyage that would 
have satisfied the Navigator’s 
worst fears. His boat had been 
lost in a storm off Campiche. 

Tragedy had been the 
firming cement of Juanita’s char- 
acter. It offered her the splendor 
of a lifelong search to replace a 
love which time made ever more 
romantic and unattainable. And 
for Dzule she created a myth of 
the mighty John (originally Juan) 
Peruge — tall, bronzed, capable of 
any great deed he might envision. 
A jealous god had taken him, 
which said something pertinent 
about gods. 

This tragedy, seen through his 
mother’s fantasies, had made 
Dzule forgive any of her offenses 
against morality. His earliest and 
strongest image of woman said 
she could not withstand life’s 
crueler torments except by seeking 
the pleasures of the bed. That was 
just the way she was and one had 
to accept it. 

The Agency had been a natural 
place for Dzule Peruge to find 
himself. Here the strong sought 



their place in life. Those who took 
the blinders from their eyes 
naturally gravitated here. The 
Agency was a last outpost of 
swashbuckling. In the Agency no 
dream was too remote, provided 
one recognized most humans as 
essentially frail — especially women. 

The bitch of the board was no 
exception. There was a weakness 
in her — had to be. She was clever, 
though, and with her own brand of 
driving ruthlessness. 

P ERGUE stared out through 
the taxi’s window at the 
rain-washed streets, reviewing the 
encounter in the board room. She 
had opened the attack by bringing 
out her own copy of the Hellstrom 
file. She had found the entries she 
wanted, referred to them and said, 
“You tell us Hellstrom’s company 
is private, incorporated in nineteen- 
fifty-eight. One chief stockholder, 
himself, and three officers — Hell- 
strom, a Miss Fancy Kalotermi 
and a Miss Mimeca Tichenum.” 
She had put down the file and 
stared down the long table at 
Peruge. “The disturbing thing to 
many of us is that, although two 
women signed their names to these 
incorporation documents in front 
of witnesses, duly notarized, you 
show no other record of them.” 
Peruge’s response, he thought, 
had suited the attack. “That’s 
correct. We don’t know where they 
came from, where educated, noth- 
ing. They both sound foreign, but 
the notary in Fosterville was satis- 
fied with their identities and the 
attorney saw no objection to their 
being officers in a corporation 
doing business in this country. 



28 



GALAXY 



Mimeca could be an oriental name, 
as some of you have indicated, and 
the other one does sound Greek — 
we just do not know. This is not a 
page we intend to keep in its pre- 
sent blank state. We are exploring 
this avenue.” 

“Do they live at Hellstrom’s 
farm?” 

“Apparently.” 

“Any description of them?” 
“Vague — dark hair, possessed 
of general female characteristics.” 
“General female characteristics? 

I wonder how you’d describe me. 
Well, no matter. What is their 
relationship to Hellstrom?” 

Peruge had taken his time with 
the response. He knew how he 
appeared to women. He was tall: 
six feet, four inches, and imposing, 
221 pounds. His sandy hair held 
a distinct touch of red which his 
eyebrows carried to a darker tone. 
The eyes were that dark brown 
often mistaken for black and deeply 
socketed above a rather abbrevi-' 
ated nose, wide mouth and square 
chin. The whole effect was domi- 
nantly masculine. He had sent this 
machismo message down the table 
with a sudden grin. 

“Madam, 1 would not describe 
you to anyone, not even to myself. 
Such is my responsibility to the 
Agency that you remain nameless 
and faceless. As to these other 
women — Hellstrom trusted them 
sufficiently to want them as offi- 
cers of his corporation, which 
makes us extremely curious about 
them. We intend to satisfy that 
curiosity. You’ll note the docu- 
ments list the Kalotermi woman 
as vice president and the other one 
as secretary-treasurer, yet each 



has but one per cent interest in 
the corporation.” 

“How old are they?” she had 
asked, glowering at him. 

“Adult.” 

“Do they travel with Hellstrom?” 
“We have no record of that.” 
“And you don’t even know 
whether these women have hus- 
bands or male attachments of any 
other nature?” 

Peruge’s heavy brows tended to 
draw down in thought or anger. 
“We don’t know this — no.” 

“And Hellstrom, is he married 
or otherwise entangled?” 

“Not that we know. The reports 
tell you all we have at this time.” 
“All? How old is Hellstrom?” 
“We’re guessing at thirty-four. 
That’s farm and ranching country 
and he was educated at home for 
the first seven years. His grand- 
mother, Trova Hellstrom, was an 
accredited teacher.” 

“I’ve done my homework,” she 
had said, tapping the file. “I raised 
the question to suggest that he’s 
fairly young to have caused so 
many waves.” 

“Old enough.” 

“You say he lectures and does 
an occasional seminar or collo- 
quiam and has been on the facul- 
ties of several universities. How 
does he get these assignments?” 
“On his reputation.” 

“Hmmmph! What do we know 
of his other associates?” 

“His technical people, business 
connections — you’ve seen the file.” 
“And he banks in Switzerland. 
Interesting. Any indication of his 
worth?” 

“Only what’s in the file.” 

“Have you considered making 



PROJECT 40 



29 



discreet inquiries of his lawyers?” 
“Do you take us for cretins?” 

. Peruge had asked. 

She had stared at him silently 
for a moment. Then: “I said 
discreet.” 

“His legal counsel, as you’ve 
seen there, is a native of Foster- 
ville, which is a small town,” 
Peruge had explained carefully. 
“A liaison between two dogs can- 
not be undertaken discreetly in 
such a setting.” 

“Hmmmph.” 

P lERUGE had looked down at 
the folders in front of him. She 
had known, of course, as had the 
rest of them, that he had not been 
telling the full story. 

“Have any of our people ever met 
this Hellstrom?” She had asked. 

Peruge had looked up, wonder- 
ing; IVhy are they letting her be 
their spokesman? Most unusual. 
He had said, “As you perhaps 
know, the Chief has connections 
to a vice president of the bank 
that handles financial matters for 
the film company that usually 
markets Hellstrom’s productions. 
This vice president has met Hell- 
strom socially and we have his 
report. It will be in your hands 
shortly.” 

“This bank does not work for 
Hellstrom’s own company?” 

“No.” 

“Have we made overtures 
through our Swiss connections?” 
“There’s no provable fraud in- 
volved and we cannot, therefore, 
gain open access to the Swiss 
records. We are still pursuing this, 
however.” 

“What is the vice president’s 



total impression of Hellstrom?” 
“An able man in his own field, 
rather quiet, but capable of occa- 
sional bursts of concentrated 
energy where his own interests are 
concerned. Specifically— when the 
subject of ecology arises.” 

“What salaries does Hellstrom 
pay his employees?” 

“Union scale where that’s indi- 
cated — guild scale — but we have 
no tax returns for some of them.” 
“The two women on his corp- 
oration records?” 

“Apparently they serve him for 
something other than money. We 
believe they live on the farm, but 
they have declared no income. It 
has been suggested that Hellstrom 
is less than generous or that fraud 
is involved. We cannot say as yet. 
Such records as we’ve seen indicate 
that his film company makes no 
profit. All the income appears to 
be taken by ongoing activities of 
an apparently legal, that is to say, 
educational, nature.” 

“Could that farm be some sort 
of subversive school?” 

“Some of the younger people 
allegedly stay there for an educa- 
tion in film-making and in ecology. 
That’s detailed in the file.” 
“Detailed,” she said, her voice 
flat. “Can we presume his installa- 
tions have been examined by 
building inspectors and that sort? 
Oregon must have laws about 
such things.” 

“He was inspected by local 
people and the accuracy of infor- 
mation based on those inspections 
remains in question. We will update 
your files as we are able.” 
“Hellstrom’s technical people, 
cameramen and such — are they 



30 



GALAXY 



all recognized in the industry?" 

“Their work has attracted 
praise.” 

“But the people themselves — 
are they admired?” 

“One could say so.” 

“What would you say?” 

“The question has little meaning 
except as an indicator for further 
investigations. It is our opinion 
that successful people in that in- 
dustry tend to achieve a surface 
admiration from their fellows, 
but that this surface attitude con- 
ceals an often quite profound 
hostility. Admiration in the usual 
sense has little to do with the 
situation except as it may indicate 
competence or income.” 

“How much traveling has Hell- 
strom done since the report in 
our hands?” 

“One trip to Kenya and two 
days at Stanford.” 

“Is he away at this moment?” 
“Possibly. 1 would have to con- 
sult our most recent reports to be 
sure. We have just fielded a new 
team, as you know. You will be 
informed, of course.” 

“Your previous reports show 
him staying away from his farm 
for two weeks to a month at a time. 
Who minds the store while he’s 
away?” 

“We do not as yet know.” 

“How thorough have our investi- 
gations of him been during his 
more vulnerable travel periods?” 
“We’ve had his luggage searched 
and found only cameras, film, 
technical works, papers, that sort 
of thing. The most common sub- 
ject matter for any written material 
in his possession has been insects. 
He appears most thorough where

his specialty is concerned. We have 
found nothing incriminating.” 
“What about planting some- 
thing on him?” 

“It is contra-indicated because 
of his stature in education. Too 
many would believe his pro- 
testations.” 

She had sat back then, quiet for 
a moment. Presently she had 
said, “You will inform the Chief 
that there must be a profit in this 
somewhere. We are not satisfied.” 
Not satisfied, Peruge thought, 
tapping his finger impatiently on 
the taxi's black plastic seat. But 
they were afraid and that was 
enough for the time being. If the 
actual material of the Project 40 
file panned out, if it developed 
along the lines he and the Chief had 
purposely not reported, then there 
would be profits enough for all, 
including Dzule Peruge. It would 
never be a weapon, of course. The 
thing created too much heat in its 
own circuits. But at low tempera- 
tures that heat might be translated 
into an induced heat for metal and 
plastic products. At the very least 
it would transform metallurgy, re- 
ducing present costs by a breath- 
taking factor. There would be 
profit in that!

Brood instructions for selected 
workers: We use the language 
of the Outside, but with our 
own meanings. It is important 
that the key distinctions not 
be confused. The practices 
of concealment demand this. 
Because we are virtually de- 
fenseless against the best 



forces of the Outside, our 
major defense remains in their 
never learning that we live 
among them, but pattern our- 
selves after hive creatures. 

AS THE afternoon above Kell- 
ys Strom’s valley wore on 
Depeaux began reflecting on the 
briefing sessions with Merrivale. 
It was a matter of emphasis, but 
he began to wonder just how many 
agents had been “wasted” on this 
project. Merrivale was a queer 
duck — that damned affected Brit- 
ish accent and all. But there had 
been times when he gave off the 
distinct impression that he admired 
Hellstrom. It was Merrivale’s 
pattern to admire only success, 
but his was an admiration always 
tinged with fear. The closer to 
Merrivale the success occurred, the 
greater his fear. 

The personless valley continued 
to bake in the hot autumn sun. 
Depeaux grew almost somnolent 
and there were moments when 
his eyelids dropped. 

He forced himself to concentrate 
on the farm buildings. If the last 
reports were to be believed Hell- 
strom himself was down there in 
one of those buildings. Nothing 
visible confirmed this assumption, 
however. 

Why would Merrivale admire 
Hellstrom? 

An abrupt slamming sound 
shocked Depeaux into full aware- 
ness. He saw movement at the far 
left corner of the barn-studio. A 
wheeled cart came into view. It 
was an odd vehicle, reminiscent of 
an old-fashioned railway baggage 
cart, the hand-pulled kind used in 



32 



GALAXY 



stations. It had high slat sides and 
big spoked wheels. A high-pitched 
voice called out a command from 
somewhere behind the building, 
but Depeaux could not make out 
the words. It had sounded like; 
“Work a load.” That made no 
sense, though. 

A young woman strode from 
behind the barn to the front of the 
cart and at first Depeaux thought 
she was nude. The binoculars re- 
vealed skin-colored briefs, but she 
wore no bra, no blouse. Her feet 
were tucked into sandals. 

The powerful glasses put De- 
peaux right up next to the young 
woman as she lowered a steering 
bar that had been caught upright 
at the front of the cart. She had 
firm breasts with dark nipples. 
He was so intent on watching her 
that he almost missed the approach 
of another young woman clad the 
same way, noticing her only when 
a strange third hand entered his 
field of vision. The young women 
were enough alike to be sisters, 
but didn’t fit the descriptions he 
had of the women who served as 
officers of Hellstrom’s corpora- 
tion. Their hair was a light gold. 

The young women took the 
steering bar and, pulling on it, 
trundled the cart toward the north 
gate. They moved with a bouncing 
urgency Depeaux found inconsis- 
tent with the long wait the box had 
had outside the gate. He saw no 
other reason for the cart. They were 
going to get the box. What was in 
that damned thing? And why were 
they almost nude? He recalled how 
the two deliverymen had strained 
in moving the box, wondered if 
the two women were expected to 



get that heavy object onto their 
cart. Surely others would come 
out and help. 

With increasing amazement he 
watched the women open the gate, 
wheel the cart into position, drop 
its end and tip the box into the 
cart’s bed. They lifted the heavy 
box with a muscular ease that 
astonished him, displaying a far 
easier time with it than had the men 
who delivered it. Briskly they 
closed the end of the cart and 
trotted back toward the barn with 
the same sense of urgency they had 
shown on the outward trip. In far 
less time than he had expected 
they were at the barn and out of 
his sight behind it. Again came 
that abrupt slamming sound. A 
door? 

Depeaux estimated the whole 
incident had taken no more than 
five minutes. Astonishing. They 
were Amazons. Yet they had 
appeared at first to be no more 
than well-developed young females. 
Was Hellstrom’s farm a hideout 
for health nuts, a kind of inland 
muscle beach? The nudity argued 
for some such answer as that. 
Depeaux didn’t like that answer, 
though — everything about the two 
women had been too casually 
businesslike. They weren’t muscle 
fanatics. They had simply been 
two workers going about a job and 
it had been a job they knew well 
enough not to need excess words 
or motions in executing it. Why 
women for that kind of work? 

It was another damn default 
message! 

D epeaux glanced at his 
watch less than an hour 



PROJECT 40

to sunset. The valley and its farm 
has settled back into that disturbing 
surface tranquillity. The place had 
been rendered even more empty 
by the brief spurt of human energy 
from the young women. 

What the hell was in that box? 

The low sun washed across the 
ridgetop to his left, shadowing 
the valley’s depths, but light re- 
flected from golden grass and 
leaves on the opposite hillside kept 
the shadows lucent. Depeaux knew 
he was in good cover under the 
dark bushes, but valley and coun- 
tryside once more had taken on 
that sense of ominous quiet. He 
took a deep breath and reaffirmed 
his decision to wait for night before 
leaving. This place had all the 
atmosphere of a trap. He squirmed 
backward, deeper into shadows, 
peered left at the open countryside 
he would have to cross. The long, 
low light bathed the field in a 
golden glow touched with orange. 
The light cast a definite shadow 
along the path of crushed grass 
that marked his trail. 

I was fool to come up that way, 
he thought. 

And perversely: What was Por- 
ter’s mistake? 

A sense of desperate immobility 
overcame him. The unexpected 
muscularity of those semi-nude 
young women, the persistent, irri- 
tating hum from the barn-studio, 
the unspoken warnings in Merri- 
vale’s briefings and the reports, 
that internalized vacuum of a 
valley set against the distant move- 
ment of cattle far outside it (why so 
far?) — everything told him to wait 
for darkness. He lay for almost an 
hour, watching, stewing in his 



own premonitions. And still he had 
to wait. 

The light dimmed. The sky took 
on a purple streaming against 
incandescent orange glow in the 
west. The slopes of the valley 
drifted into a dusky almost- 
blackness where it was difficult 
to determine if he actually saw de- 
tails or was remembering them. 
No lights showed from the farm- 
house or the barn. Visibility 
dropped to only a few feet, but 
when he crept out from under the 
bushes there were stars and a far 
sense of light on the northern 
horizon. That would be Fosterville, 
he knew. Still no lights from the 
farm. 

Another default message. 

Depeaux felt around him to 
make sure he was free of the 
bushes, rose to his feet. There was 
a tension ache in his back. He 
groped in his knapsack, took out 
a sandwich in a rattling of paper, 
unwrapped it and ate while he 
regained his sense of direction. 
Fosterville’s glowing was a good 
landmark. The sandwich restored 
him and he took a long swallow of 
water, secured his pack. 

The sense of danger remained. 

The illogic of it dominated his 
consciousness, but he had learned 
to trust that sense. It was a mes- 
sage contained in everything he had 
studied about this place — all he 
had heard and all he had seen. It 
was a message as well of things 
not seen and not heard. The com- 
bination said: Danger. 

Get the hell out of here, he told 
himself. 

He twisted his watchband to 
bring the luminous dial of its 



34 



GALAXY 



companion compass into view, 
sighted along it and set off across 
the field. As he moved out of the 
trees, his vision improved and he 
gained a sense of the long, sloping 
expanse of dried grass through 
which he had crept earlier. 

The ground was uneven under 
the grass and he stumbled often. 
His passage kicked up dust and 
several times he stopped to repress 
a sneeze. His own passage through 
the grass seemed to him abnorm- 
ally loud in the night silence, but 
there was a faint breeze and when 
he stopped he could hear it sough- 
ing in the trees ahead of him. There 
was a similarity between the two 
sounds, which he tried to improve 
upon by slowing his pace. He had 
accumulated more grass burrs and 
they rasped his skin. Slow move- 
ment irritated him, too. He found 
himself unconsciously picking up 
speed. Something inside him 
said: Hurry. 

The luminous dial of his com- 
pass and the glowing sky oriented 
him well, though. He found he 
could see the occasional trees in 
the field and avoided them easily. 
The dark line of thicker trees 
through which he had come stood 
out plainly. There would be the 
game trail to follow through there. 
He expected to encounter the trail 
long before his feet actually felt 
the hard, grassless surface. He 
crouched to feel the surface with 
his hands, tracing the almost worn- 
down hoofmarks in the dirt. No 
deer had passed this way in a long 
while. Those were very old marks 
— he had noted this earlier, but 
now it compounded the total mes- 
sage of this place. 



D EPEAUX started to 
straighten and strike out 
along the trail when he became 
aware of a distant swishing in the 
field behind him. He tipped his 
head to listen. The swishing didn’t 
sound like someone walking 
through the grass or like the wind. 
It had no definite position — just 
somewhere back there. Starlight 
showed him nothing but distant 
shadows that could be trees, the 
configuration of the land. The 
sound was growing louder and he 
felt menace in it. There was some- 
thing akin to a susurrant humming 
in it now. He straightened, turned 
away from the sound and began 
trotting along the trail. He found 
he could make out the track if he 
peered down at a sharp angle. 

Soon he was at the line of thicker 
trees, the witchspread of madronas 
and the heavier spacing of pines. 
The trees reduced the faint assist- 
ance starlight had given him and 
he was forced to slow his pace to a 
walk. Several times he lost the trail 
and had to grope for it with his 
feet. He longed to take out the 
small flashlight in his pack, but 
that odd sound had grown even 
louder behind him. It was a defi- 
nite hissing-humming now. What 
made that sound? The noise of 
countless hoopskirts dragging 
through the grass would not be 
as mechanical. The image of 
hoopskirts amused him for a mo- 
ment, though, until he thought of 
the seminude young Amazons at 
the farm. Somehow they were not 
amusing even when clad in his 
imaginary hoopskirts. 

He had hidden the bicycle in 
bushes where the game trail crossed 



PROJECT 40 



35 



a narrow dirt road. That road led 
around a low hill and down a long 
slope to the county road where he 
had parked the van. The bicycle 
had a handlebar light and he pro- 
mised himself he would use that 
light and ride like hell. 

Was that sound behind him 
louder? What the hell could make 
it? Was it something natural? Birds, 
perhaps? The susurrant intrusion 
reached now out into the grass on 
both sides of him, as though he 
were being drawn into the wings of 
an advancing army. Depeaux had 
the auditory impression of many 
creatures moving in a wide fan to 
enclose him. He tried to increase 
his speed, but the night was too 
dark — he kept running into trees. 

What was that sound? 

His body was wet with perspira- 
tion — fear was tight in his chest. 

Again he tried to quicken his 
pace, tripped and fell full length. 
The susurrant pursuit stopped. 
Depeaux lay quietly, waiting, 
probing with his ears. Nothing, 
What the hell? The absence of 
sound was as frightening as its 
presence had been. He rose siowly 
to his feet and immediately the 
noise started again. It was on both 
sides and behind him. Terrified 
now, Depeaux stumbled forward, 
tripping, lurching, crashing through 
trees, sometimes on the trail and 
sometimes off it. 

Where was that damned road 
where he had hidden the bike? 

The horns of enclosing noise 
were ahead of him now, on both 
sides and ahead. Depeaux, panting, 
stumbling, groped for the flash- 
light in his pack, found it. Why 
hadn’t he brought a gun? An auto- 



matic even? A little one like the one 
Tymiena carried? Damn! What was 
that noise? He wondered if he 
dared turn on the flashlight and 
sweep its beam around him. He 
hadn't been able to make himself 
bring even a little gun! No! His 
birdwatcher cover had ruled 
against it! He was panting and 
gasping now. His legs ached. 

The road was under his feet 
before he realized it. He stumbled 
to a halt, tried to get his bearings 
in the dark. Had he left the trail 
just back there? He didn’t believe 
he could be far from the bushes 
where he’d hidden the damned 
bike. It had to be right nearby. 
Did he dare use the flashlight? 
The hissing hum enclosed him now. 
The bike had to be just to his right. 
It had to be. He groped toward 
blacker shadows among shadows, 
stumbled over a bush and landed in 
the frame of the bicycle. 

Cursing under his breath, De- 
peaux rose to his feet, pulled the 
bicycle upright and leaned against 
it. He could see the road better 
now — a separation of lightness in 
the dark— and he thought suddenly 
how good it would be just to get on 
the bicycle and coast back to the 
van and Tymiena. But the hissing 
hum had grown louder, closing in 
on him. The hell with them. He 
yanked the flashlight from the 
pack, depressed the switch. The 
beam stabbed out into the trees. It 
revealed three young women clad as 
the Amazons at the farm had 
been— tight briefs and sandals — but 
their eyes and noses were hidden 
behind glossy dark shields the 
shape of diving masks. Each carried 
a long wand with a twined, whip- 



36 



GALAXY 



like end. The wands made him 
think of some odd antenna system, 
but their doubled ends were pointed 
directly at him and there was no 
mistaking the menace. 



From Nils Hells trom's diary: 
Sometimes I realize my name 
isn’t important. It could be any 
other grouping of sounds and 
I’d still be me. Names are not 
important. This is a good 
thought. It is precisely as my 
brood mother and my first 
teachers said. The name 1 used 
represents an accident. It is not 
the name that might have been 
given to me had I been born 
into an Outsider family with all 
their usual self-centered indivi- 
dualism. Their consciousness is 
not my consciousness — their 
timeline is not my timeline. We 
of the Hive will do away with 
names some day. My brood 
mother’s words convey a deep 
sense of reassurance in this. 
Our perfect society cannot al- 
low permanent individual 
names. They are labels at best, 
are names. They are useful only 
in a transient way. Perhaps we 
will carry different labels at dif- 
ferent stages in our lives. Or 
numbers. Somehow numbers 
feel more in keeping with the 
intent my brooa mother ex- 
pressed so well. 



I T WAS twenty minutes to three 
A.M. and for almost ten minutes 
now Clovis had been watching Ed- 
die pace back and forth in the tiny 
living room of her apartment. The 
telephone had awakened them from 
deep sleep and Eddie had answered 



it. He had come openly to her 
apartment. The Agency didn’t 
mind that. It expected certain 
sexual antics from its people and 
appreciated it when such activity 
was kept intramural. Nothing deep 
and demanding in this sex — ^just 
good, energetic bodily enjoyment. 

All Eddie had said after hanging 
up was: “That was DT! Merrivale 
told him to call. They’ve lost 
contact with Carlos and Tymiena.’’ 

“Oh, my God!’’ 

She had gotten out of bed, draped 
a robe about her. Eddie had gone 
directly into the living room. 

“I should have answered the 
phone,’’ she said now, hoping this 
would break him out of his deep 
reverie. 

“Why? DT was looking for me.’’ 

“Here?” 

“Yes.” 

“How did he know you were 
here?” 

“He tried my place and nobody 
answered.” 

“Eddie, I don’t like that.” 

“Shit!” 

“Eddie, what’s the rest of it? 
What did DT say?” 

He stopped in front of her and 
stared down at her feet, which she 
had pulled partly under her body 
when flopping into a chair. “He 
says we’ve gotta play brother and 
sister again. Nick Myerlie is going 
to be our daddy and we’re going on 
a nice vacation way out in Oregon.” 

V 

From Nils Hells trom’s diary: 
Fancy is showing sure signs of 
unhappiness about her life in 
the Hive. I wonder if she has 



PROJECT 40 



37 



somehow become conditioned 
to prefer life Outside. We’ve al- 
ways worried about that and it 
does appear to happen some- 
times. I'm afraid she’ll try to 
run away. If she does I think I 
will opt for stumping her, 
rathtr than putting her in the 
vats; Her firstborn, Saldo, is 
everything we had hoped. I do 
not want the Hive to lose that 
breeding potential. It’s too bad 
she’s so good with the insects. 
We will have to keep close 
watch on her until the present 
film is finished. Whatever hap- 
pens, we cannot send her on 
any more Outside assignments 
until we’re sure of her. Perhaps 
we should give her more in- 
ternal responsibility for the 
film. She might grow to share 
my vision then and be cured of 
this instability. This film is so 
very necessary to us. It is a new 
beginning. With it and the ones 
to come we will prepare the 
world for our answer to human 
survival. 1 know that Fancy 
shares the schismatic belief. 
She believes the insects will 
outlast us. Even my brood 
mother feared this danger, but 
her answer and my refinement 
of that answer must be devel- 
oped. We must become more 
intensely like those upon whom 
we pattern our lives 

I AOES this shock you?” 
X-/ Hellstrom asked. 

He was a blond man of medium 
build, whose appearance suggested 
no more than the thirty-four years 
Depeaux knew the Agency’s 
records credited to him. There was 



a great sense of internal dignity 
about Hellstrom, a sense of purpose 
that revealed itself in the way his 
blue eyes held a direct stare on 
anything or anyone of interest to 
him. He gave the impression that he 
contained more energy than he re- 
leased. 

Hellstrom stood in a laboratory, 
confronting his captive, who had 
been tied to a plastic chair. The la- 
boratory was a place of polished 
metal and gleaming white surfaces, 
of glass and instrument dials illumi- 
nated by a flat milky light from a 
coving completely around the 
ceiling’s edge. 

Depeaux had awakened here 
after being unconscious. He did not 
know how long he had been in a 
coma, but his mind was still fogged. 
He had awakened to find Hellstrom 
standing in front of him and two 
completely naked women guarding 
him. He knew he was paying too 
much attention to the women, 
another pair of Amazons, but he 
couldn’t help it. 

“I see they shock you,” Hel- 
lstrom said. 

“Guess they do at that,” De- 
peaux admitted. “I’m not used to 
seeing so much naked female flesh 
around me.” 

“Female flesh,” Hellstrom said 
and clucked his tongue. 

“Don’t they mind our talking 
about them this way?” Depeaux 
asked. 

“They do not understand us,” 
Hellstrom said. “Even if they did 
they would not understand your at- 
titude. It is a typical Outsider atti- 
tude, but I never fail to find it 
strange.” 

Depeaux tried a cautious testing

pull at the bindings that held him to 
the chair. He had come to with his 
head throbbing and it still ached. 
There was a pain right behind his 
eyes and he had no idea of how 
much time had passed. He recalled 
starting to speak to the three young 
women his flashlight had re- 
vealed — then he had been startled 
into silence by the sudden 
awareness that many more similar 
figures filled the darkness all 
around him. A confused welter of 
memories clouded that recollection. 
God, his mind still felt thick. He re- 
membered speaking, an innocuous 
and stupid response brought about 
by fear and shock: “This is where I 
left my bicycle.” 

Christ! He had been standing 
there, holding the damned bicycle, 
but those opaque diving masks had 
daunted him. They had given no 
clue to the eyes behind them or to 
intentions. The wavering double 
wands aimed at him could only 
have meant threat, though. He had 
had no idea what those wands were, 
but a weapon was a weapon was a 
weapon. The double wands had 
branched from short handles, which 
the young women had gripped with 
firm competence. The tips of the 
instruments had emitted a low hum. 
While he had been wondering if he 
dared to try breaking through the 
circle, a nightbird had swooped 
toward the fluttering insects at- 
tracted by his light. A figure in the 
dim area beyond the light had 
raised her double wand. A sudden 
dry hissing, the same sound he had 
heard all around him crossing the 
fields, and the bird had collapsed in 
the air and plummeted to the 
ground. A woman had scrambled 



forward and stuffed the bird into a 
sack at her shoulder. He had no- 
ticed then that many of the women 
carried such sacks and that the 
sacks bulged. 

“I — I hope I’m not trespassing,” 
Depeaux had ventured. “1 was told 
this was a good area for my hobby. 
1 like — to watch birds.” 

How stupid he had sounded. 

What in hell were those wands? 
That bird hadn’t even flopped once. 
Hiss-bang! Merrivale hadn’t said 
anything about this. Could this be 
Project 40, for God’s sake? Why 
hadn’t the crazy broads around him 
said something? It was as though 
they hadn’t heard him — or didn’t 
understand him. Did they speak 
another language? 

“Look,” he had said, “my name 
is — ” 

And that was all he could re- 
member, except for another brief 
burst of that odd hissing hum from 
his left and, yes, the painful 
sensation that his head had ex- 
ploded. He remembered that now — 
explosive pain within his skull. His 
head still ached as he stared up at 
Hellstrom. Those wands had done 
it — no doubt of that in his mind. 
The two women standing guard be- 
hind him carried the same weapons, 
although they weren’t wearing the 
masks of the group that had encir- 
cled him. 

I'm in the soup, he thought. 
Nothing to do but brazen it out. 

“Why do you have me tied up?” 
he asked. 

“Don’t waste our time with the 
ingenuous approach,” Hellstrom 
said. “We must keep you secured 
until we decide how to dispose of 
you.” 



PROJECT 40

Depeaux, his throat painfully 
dry, his heart suddenly pounding, 
said, “That’s a nasty word, that dis- 
pose. 1 don’t like that word.’’ 

H ELLSTROM sighed. Yes, 
the /word had been a poor 
choice. He was tired and it had been 
a long night and it wasn’t over yet. 
Damn these Outside intruders. 
What did they really want? He said, 
“My apologies. I don’t mean to 
cause you needless worry or dis- 
comfort. But you are not the first 
person we have caught here in 
similar circumstances.’’ 

Depeaux experienced an abrupt 
sensation of deja vu. He felf that he 
was reliving something half-re- 
membered because it had not been 
his own experience, but something 
that had happened to someone 
close to him. Porter? He hadn’t 
been all that close to Porter, but . 

“And you disposed of these 
others, too?” Depeaux asked. 

Hellstrom ignored the question. 
This was all so distasteful. He said: 
“Your credentials identify you as a 
salesman for a firewords company. 
One of the others who intruded here 
worked for this identical company. 
Isn’t that strange?” 

Depeaux forced his words 
through a dry mouth. “If his name 
was Porter there’s nothing strange 
about it at all. He told me about 
this place.” 

“No doubt a fellow birdwatcher,” 
Hellstrom said. He turned his 
back on Depeaux. Was there no 
other way to meet this threat? 

Again Depeaux recalled the bird 
the woman had knocked from the 
night sky. What was that weapon? 
Was it the answer to the mystery of 



Project 40? He decided to try 
another tack. “I saw some of your 
woman friends kill a bird last night. 
They shouldn’t do that. Birds are 
an important part of — ” 

“Oh, be still!” Hellstrom spoke 
without turning. “Of course they 
killed a bird — and insects, rabbits, 
mice and quite a few other crea- 
tures as well. We couldn’t waste the 
night sweep just picking you up.” 
Depeaux shook his head. Night 
sweep? “Why do they do that?” he 
asked. 

“For food, naturally.” 

Hellstrom glanced back at his 
captive. “1 must have time to con- 
sider the problem raised by your 
presence. I don’t suppose you’ll 
drop your subterfuges and tell me 
the whole story.” 

“1 don’t even know what you’re 
talking about,” Depeaux protested, 
but he was sweating profusely and 
knew Hellstrom could read that 
sign. 

“I see,” Hellstrom said. He 
sounded sad. “Do not try to escape. 
The two workers there know they 
must kill you if you try to get away. 
There’s no sense trying to talk to 
them. They don’t speak. They’re 
also quite jumpy — they can smell 
your difference. You are an Out- 
sider in our midst and they’ve been 
trained to dispose of such intruders. 
Now, if you’ll excuse me.” 

Turning on his heel, Hellstrom 
strode from the room, pushing a 
sliding door aside. Before it closed 
Depeaux glimpsed a wide corridor 
filled with milky light and throng- 
ing with humans — males and fe- 
males, all completely nude. Two of 
them passed the door as Hellstrom 
left, causing him to hesitate. The

two, both women, carried what ap- 
peared to be a naked male body, the

stand me may be useful in your 
planning for the future. 



From Nils Hellstrom's diary: 
It is a conceit that makes me 
write these lines, trying to ima- 
gine the specialists who will 
read them. Are you really there 
in some future time — or are 
you merely creatures of my 
imagination? I know the Hive 
will need the abilities of readers 
for a long time. But forever is 
an even longer time and it 
dwarfs my small utterances. 
You who may be reading these 
words, then, if you share my 
questionings, must realize that 
your talents as readers may 
be abandoned eventually. 
Whether this specialty serves 
an infinite purpose is a real 
question. There may come a 
time when these words remain, 
but there will be no one to read 
them. In a practical sense the 
material on which my words 
are recorded would perhaps be 
recognized as useful stuff to be 
employed for other purposes. It 
must be a conceit, then, that I 
address myself to anyone. That 
I do so at all must be attributed 
to an instinct for short-term 
purpose. I support my brood 
mother’s solution to the Out- 
sider problem. We must never 
merely oppose the Outsiders, 
but should work with compro- 
mise and constant pressure to 
absorb them into our unity. 
This is what we do now at my 
direction and, if you have 
changed that goal, I tell myself 
that my helping you to under- 



H ELLSTROM had been 
awakened from his daysleep 
by a young female watchworker. 
Her observation screen had re- 
vealed the Outsider intruding on 
Hive territory. Hellstrom’s cell had 
been closed off for the privacy a 
keyworker could enjoy, and the 
young watchworker had come per- 
sonally to Hellstrom, shaking his 
shoulder gently to awaken him. She 
had given him the information in 
the swift and silent gesture lan- 
guage of the Hive. 

The intruder could be observed 
on the hill above the Hive-head 
buildings. He was using binoculars 
to study the area. His approach had 
been noted far out by sensors in a 
perimeter tunnel. He had left a 
companion with a vehicle near the 
road to Fosterville. 

The entire message took three 
seconds. 

With a sigh Hellstrom slid from 
the foam and down warmth of his 
bed, flashed a hand signal to the 
watchworker that he understood. 
She left the cell. Hellstrom crossed 
the floor’s smooth tiles, their 
coolness helping to awaken him. He 
activated the bank of repeaters that 
gave him contact with the Hive’s se- 
curity sensors. He focused on the 
section the watchworker had indi- 
cated. 

At first Hellstrom had difficulty 
locating the Outside intruder in the 
tall grass. The light was always bad 
in that direction at this hour of the 
afternoon. He wondered if the 
watchworker could have been mis- 
taken about the screen to watch. 



PROJECT 40 



41 



The watchworkers became sensitive 
and twitchy at times, but he had yet 
to find one turning in a false alarm 
or making a major error. 

Hellstrom studied the tall brown 
grass carefully. The panorama in 
the hot afternoon light appeared 
unbrokfin. Abruptly something 
moved in the grass at the ridgecrest. 
As though movement had created a 
new scene, he saw the intruder. The 
Outsider was a male clothed to 
match the grass with a closeness 
that surely could not be accidental. 
More than seventy years of living 
the Hive life had made the necessity 
for concealment a reflex with 
Hellstrom. He had possessed the 
sense of caution long before he had 
assumed a false age and moved out 
of the Hive to build an Outsider 
identity. Now, seeing the prying in- 
truder, he moved briskly, slipped 
his feet into sandals, draped a white 
lab smock over his body. He 
glanced at the crystal-driven clock 
on his wall: 2:59 p.m. The clock, ac- 
curate to four seconds in a year, 
had been built by a brood-mate 
whose breeding and training had 
sent her into the laboratories for 
life. 

Hellstrom thought about the in- 
truder. If this one waited as the 
others had done he could be taken 
in the dark. Hellstrom made a 
mental note to get the night sweep 
started early and with special 
preparations for this possibility. 
The Hive had to learn why these 
Outsiders were prying. 

Before leaving his cell, Hellstrom 
studied the Hive’s outer perimeter 
on his repeaters and saw — far down 
in the western valley — a camper 
with a woman seated beside it. 



sketching on a tablet held in her lap. 
He magnified the view, saw nervous 
tension m the woman’s shoulder 
muscles, an involuntary movement 
of the head that drew her gaze up 
the slopes leading to the Hive. She 
would have to 1^ picked up, too. 
Why were Outsiders suspicious of 
the farm? Who was behind this? 
There was something professional 
about this intrusion that made Hell- 
strom’s heartbeat quicken. 

He chewed thoughtfully on his 
lower lip while he searched in- 
wardly for an instrinct with which 
to meet this threat. The Hive was 
strong and hidden in a way that did 
not invite attention, but he knew 
how vulnerable it was, how little 
that strength would count against 
the shocked awareness of the Out- 
siders. 

H IS gaze moved absently 
around his cell. It was one of 
the larger cubicles in the complex 
warren that underlay the farm and 
surrounding hills. It had been one 
of the first constructed by the 
original colonists who had brought 
their centuries-long migrations here 
under his brood mother’s guidance. 

It is time to stop running, my 
beloved workers. We who have 
lived furtive double lives among the 
Outsiders for more than 300 
years — dissembling, always ready 
to move at the slightest suspicion — 
have come to the place that will 
shelter us and make up strong. 

She had claimed a vision guided 
her, a visit in her dreams from the 
Blessed Mendel “. whose words 
told us that the way we had always 
known was the true way.”

the one he had received before 
going Outside as a counterfeit 
teenager sent at last to get his 
“book learning,” had been filled 
with the thoughts of his brood 
mother. 

The best must breed with the 
best. In that way we produce the 
disparate workers we need for 
every task our Hive can confront. 

On that cold April day in 1876 
when they had begun to dig out- 
ward from the natural caverns be- 
neath the farm, building their first 
Hive, she had told them: We will 
perfect our way and thus become 
the "meek” whose Earth will one 
day welcome them. 

The cell he occupied now dated 
from that first digging, although 
the diggers and his brood mother 
had long ago gone into the vats. 
The cell was sixteen feet wide and 
twenty-two feet long, eight feet from 
floor to ceiling. It was not quite 
square at the rear to accommo- 
date an arm of the original natural 
cavern. The cell could have had a 
door in that arm, but the decision 
had been made to put service 
conduits, piping and other ducts 
there. From the original limestone 
labyrinth the Hive had been ex- 
tended downward more than a mile, 
reaching outward in a circle 
almost two miles in diameter below 
the 3,000-foot level. It was a teem- 
ing warren of close to 50,000 work- 
ers (far beyond his brood mother’s 
hopes), closely integrated with their 
own factories, hydroponics gar- 
dens, laboratories, breeding cen- 
ters, even an underground river 
that helped produce the power 
they required. No wall of the 
original cavern could be seen now. 



All walls were a uniform smooth 
gray and made of the hive’s own 
mucilaginous pre-stressed concrete. 

In Hellstrom’s own cell the lough 
gray wallspace had been covered 
with various plans and sketches 
involved in the Hive’s growth 
over the years. He had never taken 
them down, a wasteful idiosyncrasy 
the Hive tolerated in very few 
workers. His walls were now thick 
with pasted-over records of the 
Hive’s vitality. 

Although he had more cell space 
than others, his furnishings were 
otherwise Hive-standard: a bed 
formed of the mucilage slabs with 
rawhide lacing under a foam pad, 
chairs of similar construction, desk 
of mucilage supports for a ceramic 
top in rich glassgreen, twelve 
metal filing cabinets of Outsider 
manufacture (Hive cabinets were 
sturdier, but he fancied these for 
their reminder value), the repeater 
console with its screens and direct 
line into the central computer. A 
wardrobe with Outsider clothing 
in one corner marked him as one of 
the key workers who fronted for 
the Hive in that threatening world 
beyond their perimeters. Except 
for two adjustable lamps, one over 
the desk and the other over the 
repeater console, the room was 
illuminated by coved radiating 
tubes along the intersection of 
ceiling and walls, a standard prac- 
tice in all the galleries, tunnels and 
cells of the Hive. 

He could have had one of the 
newer modern and more sophis- 
ticated cells in the lower levels, 
but Hellstrom preferred the place 
he had occupied since the day his 
brood mother had gone to the 



PROJECT 40 



43 



vats “becoming one with us all." 

Hellstrom strode back and forth 
on the tiles of his floor now, wor- 
rying about the intruder. Whom did 
that man represent? Certainly he 
was not there out of casual cu- 
riosity. Hellstrom sensed a 
powerful * force outside slowly 
turning its deadly attention toward 
the Hive. 

He knew he could not delay his 
response any longer. The watch- 
workers would be irritably restless. 
They needed commands and a 
feeling that proper action was being 
taken. Hellstrom bent to his con- 
sole, coded his instructions and sent 
them into the relay system. Those 
instructions would be transmitted 
throughout the warren. Key 
workers would take pre-assigned 
actions. Every worker selected by 
the relay system through the Hive’s 
central computer would see gesture 
signals on a screen. The silent lan- 
guage of the Hive would bind them 
into a common defense. 

In common with many of the key 
workers who would unite thus, 
Hellstrom knew how thing the 
Hive’s defenses really were. The 
knowledge sent fear through him 
now and he longed for the mental 
oblivion of the commonworker who 
had few concerns beyond im- 
mediate tasks. 

D riven by his fear, Hellstrom 
opened a filing drawer, ext- 
racted a folder tagged julius 
PORTER. The ordinary vat mark 
had been stamped on the outside of 
the folder to tell what had happened 
to Porter’s flesh, as though he had 
been discarded breeding stock 
whose records were kept as com- 



mentary on offspring, but Porter 
had no offsprmg Tn the Hive. He 
had merely brought a sense of mys- 
terious threat, which he had left 
largely unanswered. Something 
about the new intruder outside right 
now made Hellstrom think of 
Porter. Hellstrom trusted such in- 
stincts. He glanced through the 
closely spaced lines of informa- 
tion inscribed in Hive code. Porter 
had carried credentials identifying 
him as an employe of the Blue 
Devil Firewords Company of 
Baltimore. He had babbled some- 
thing finally about “The Agency.’’ 
This Agency has represented in 
his terrified mind something that 
would avenge him. 

Agency. 

Hellstrom regretted now that 
they had sent Porter so soon into 
the vats. The act had been callous 
and careless. 

The idea of using the pain of a fel- 
low creature, however, went against 
Hive sensitivities. Pain was a recog- 
nizable phenomenon. When it oc- 
curred in a worker and could not be 
eased that worker might go to the 
vats. Outsiders did not behave this 
way, though. This was a Hive pecu- 
liarity. One killed to eat, to survive. 
The killing might cause pain, but 
that was quickly ended. One did not 
prolong it. Survival might dictate 
other courses, but the Hive avoided 
those. 

Presently Hellstrom put the 
folder aside, depressed a key at his 
repeater station. He asked for one 
of the security overseers in the aerie 
watchroom of the barn-studio. The 
instrument that carried his voice 
was of Hive construction and he ad- 
mired its flat functionalism as he 



44 



GALAXY 



waited for a response. Old Harvey 
came on the screen above the 
instrument. His voice quavered 
slightly. Old Harvey would have to 
go into the vats before long, Hell- 
strom reflected, but that could be 
delayed because this man had tal- 
ents the Hive required — and never 
more desperately than right now. 
Old Harvey had been one of the 
First Breeders. His seed was all 
through the Hive. But he was also 
knowledgeable in the ways of the 
Outside and an imaginative 
guardian of Hive security. 

They spoke openly on the in- 
ternal circuit. There wasn’t even the 
remotest chance that the Outsiders 
possessed instruments that could 
penetrate the Hive’s electronic bar- 
riers. In this field Hive specialists 
already had moved far ahead of 
Outsiders. 

“You know about the intruder, of 
course.” Hellstrom said. 

“Yes.” 

“You’ve been watching him per- 
sonally?” 

“Yes. I sent the watchworker to 
call you.” 

“What’s he been doing?” 

“Just watching. With binoculars 
mostly.” 

“Do we have anyone out?” 

“No.” 

“Is any exterior activity 
scheduled?” 

“Only a delivery — diamond bits 
for our Level Fifty-one drills.” 

“Don’t pick it up until you clear 
with me.” 

“Right.” 

“Is there any chance he’s car- 
rying relay instruments that could 
monitor his activities from a dis- 
tance?” 



“Porter carried no such instru- 
ments.” 

H ellstrom suppressed a 

feeling of irritation, but noted 
that Old Harvey had also made that 
same unconscious connection with 
Porter. 

“I mean, have we checked?” 
Hellstrom asked. 

“Not completely. We’re still in 
process of checking.” 

“Ah, we’re being thorough,” 
Hellstrom said. 

“Of course.” 

“Tell me as soon as you’re sure.” 
“Yes.” 

“What about aircraft?” Hell- 
strom asked. “Anything?” 

“Two jets, very, high -more than 
an hour ago.” 

“Any indication of probes from 
the jets?” 

“Nothing. They were commer- 
cial transports. Clean.” 

“Does the intruder look as 
though he’s settled in for a long 
stav?” 

‘'^He has a knapsack and lunch. 
We think he’ll wait for nightfall be- 
fore leaving. We’ve been hitting 
him with an occasional low-fre- 
quency burst to keep him jumpy.” 
“Excellent.” Hellstrom nodded 
to himself. “Keep up the subsonics. 
If he’s nervous he’ll make mistakes. 
But don’t use too much — you could 
drive him off before dark.” 

“1 understand,” Old Harvey 
said. 

“Now, as to that woman waiting 
by the vehicle out near our pe- 
rimeter — what do you make of 
her?” 

“We’re keeping her under close 
surveillance. The intruder came 



PROJECT 40 



45 



from her direction. We think 
they’re associated.” He cleared his 
throat — the loud and rasping sound 
said something distinct about his 
age. Hellstrom was made acutely 
aware that Old Harvey must be 
more than two hundred years old 
and that was very old for a First 
Colonist who had not had the be- 
nefit of an entire lifetime under 
Hive regimen. 

“Undoubtedly they’re associ- 
ated,” Hellstrom said. 

“Could they be innocent in- 
truders?” Old Harvey asked. 

“Do you really entertain that 
idea?” Hellstrom asked. 

There was a long pause, then: 
“Not likely, but possible.” 

“I think they came from the same 
source as Porter,” Hellstrom said. 

“Should we have our people in 
the east look into the Blue Devil 
Fireworks Company?” Old Harvey 
asked. 

“No. That might betray the 
extent of our influence. 1 think ex- 
treme caution is indicated — espe- 
cially if this pair has come to find 
out what happened to Porter.” 

“Perhaps we acted top hastily 
with that one.” 

“I’ve had my own misgivings on 
that score,” Hellstrom admitted. 

“What is this Agency that Porter 
represented?” 

H ellstrom reflected on 
this. The question contained 
his own unease. Porter had talked 
profusely at the end. The scene had 
been disgusting and had hastened 
his transit into the choppers and the 
vats. Yet the necessities of that epi- 
sode could have clouded its content. 
No member of the Hive would ever 



have behaved that way. Not even 
an ordinary worker, although they 
could speak no language intelligible 
Outside. Porter had said the 
Agency would get them. The 
Agency was all-powerful. We know 
about you now! We'll get you! 
Porter had been the first adult Out- 
sider ever to see the inner workers 
of the Hive and his hysterical revul- 
sion at the ordinary things neces- 
sary for Hive life had shaken Hell- 
strom. 

/ responded to hysteria with a 
hysteria of my own, Hellstrom 
thought. I must never do so again. 

“We will question this pair more 
carefully,” Hellstrom said. “Per- 
haps they can tell us about this 
Agency.” 

“You think it wise to capture 
them?” 

“1 think it necessary.” 

“Perhaps other responses should 
be considered first.” 

“What are you suggesting?” 

“Discreet inquiry by our people 
in the east while we dissemble for 
these new intruders. Why should we 
not invite them in and let them 
watch our surface activities. They 
surely cannot prove we are respon- 
sible for the disappearance of their 
fellow.” 

“We don’t know that for 
certain.” 

“Surety their reaction would have 
been different if they knew we were 
responsible.” 

“They know,” Hellstrom said. 
“They just don’t know how or why. 
No amount of dissembling now will 
put them off. They’ll keep worrying 
at us like ants at a carcass. We 
must dissemble, yes, but we must 
keep them off balance at the same 



46 



GALAXY 



time. I am keeping our people Out- 
side informed, but my instructions 
remain that we exercise the utmost 
restraint and caution there. Better 
to sacrifice the Hive than to lose 
all.” 

“In your considerations, please 
note that I disagree,” Old Harvey 
said. 

“Your exception is noted and will 
not be ignored.” 

“They are sure to send others,” 
Old Harvey said 
1 agree. 

“Each new team is likely to be 
more skilled, Nils.” 

“No doubt of that. But great 
skill, as we’ve learned from our own 
specialists, tends to narrow the 
vision. I doubt very much that these 
first probes involve the central 
element of this Agency. Soon, 
however, they will send someone 
who knows all the things we wish to 
know about those who come prying 
into our affairs.” 

Old Harvey’s hesitation betrayed 
that he had not considered this pos- 
sibility. Presently he said, “You 
will try to capture and control such 
a one?” 

“We must.” 

“That’s a dangerous gambit. 
Nils.” 

“Circumstances dictate the risk.” 

“I disagree even more,” Old 
Harvey said. “1 have lived Outside, 
Nils, I know them. Yours is an ex- 
tremely perilous course.” 

“Do you have an alternative with 
a lower potential risk?” Hellstrom 
asked. “Extend your plot-line be- 
fore answering. You must think of 
the ultimate consequences along the 
sequence of events dictated by our 
present response. We made a mis- 



take with Porter. We thought him 
the kind of Outsider we have taken 
and consigned to the vats pre- 
viously. The wisdom of the sweep- 
leader brought him to my close at- 
tention after his capture. The mis- 
take at that point was mine, but the 
consequences involve us all. My 
own regrets do not change the sit- 
uation one whit. Our problem is 
complicated by the fact that we 
cannot erase all the backtracks that 
led Porter to us. We have been able 
to make such erasures before 
without exception. Our previous 
successes lulled me into a false 
complacency. A long history of suc- 
cess does not ensure correct deci- 
sions. I knew this and yet failed. I 
will entertain an action to depose 
me, but I will not change my 
present decision on a course of ac- 
tion — which includes an awareness 
of my past mistake.” 

“Nils, I’m not suggesting that we 
depose — ” 

“Then obey my instructions,” 
Hellstrom said. “Although I am a 
male, I am chief in the Hive at my 
brood mother’s command. She 
reckoned the importance of that 
choice and, thus far, her vision has 
remained close to actual events. 
And while you’re putting the sonic 
probes on that woman and her ve- 
hicle, check it for the possibility 
that she may have a child inside.” 
Old Harvey sounded hurt. “I’m 
aware of our constant need for new 
blood. Nils. Your orders will be 
obeyed at once.” 

H ellstrom released the 
communications key, and Old 
Harvey’s face disappeared from the 
screen. Old Harvey’s Hive

awareness might be dulled by that 
early history of Outside life, but he 
knew how to obey against the dic- 
tates of his most basic fears. In this 
respect he was completely trust- 
worthy — which was more than 
could be .said for most of the hu- 
mans who had evolved Outside, 
conditioned as they were there by 
the sharp limitations that prevailed 
in what the Hive thought of as 
“wild societies.” Old Harvey was a 
good worker. 

Hellstrom sighed at the 
knowledge of the burden he car- 
ried — almost 50,000 dependent 
workers were going about their ac- 
tivities in the Hive warren. He lis- 
tened with his whole being for a 
moment, probing for the sense that 
told him all remained normal in the 
Hive. Normalcy felt like the low 
humming of harvesting bees on a 
hot afternoon — there was a restful 
sense to it that he needed at times to 
restore him. But the Hive gave him 
back no such reassurance now. He 
could actually sense the disquiet of 
his own commands spreading 
throughout the Hive and reflecting 
back onto himself. 

All was not well here. 

The need for caution had always 
been a constant pressure on the 
Hive and every one of its inhabi- 
tants. He had his own fair share of 
this inbred caution which had been 
finely tuned by his brood mother 
and the ones she had chosen to edu- 
cate him. He had been against 
making the documentary movies at 
first. But the Hive aphorism — Who 
could know more about insects 
than the Hive-born? — had over- 
come his objections and finally even 
he had entered the spirit of the film 



enterprise without reservations. 
The Hive always needed that 
ubiquitous energy symbol, money. 
The films brought a great deal of 
money to their Swiss accounts. 
That money focused concern on the 
Hive’s remaining needs for Outside 
resources — the diamond bits for 
their drills, for instance. Unlike the 
“wild societies,” however, the Hive 
sought a harmony with its envi- 
ronment, cooperating to serve that 
environment, thus purchasing the 
environment’s service to the Hive. 
Surely that profound internal rela- 
tionship, which had always sup- 
ported the Hive in the past, would 
support it now. The films are not a 
mistake, he told himself. There was 
even something poetically amusing 
about their purpose: to frighten 
Outsiders by showing them reality 
in the form of films about the 
world’s insect populations— while a 
much deeper reality growing out of 
that insect mold fed on the fears it 
had helped augment. 

He reminded himself of the lines 
he had insisted be written into the 
script of their most recent film ef- 
fort. In the perfect society there is 
neither emotion nor mercy — 
precious space cannot be wasted on 
those who have outlived their use- 
fulness. 



T his new outsider intrusion 
made Hellstrom think now, 
however, of the Bee Wolf, whose 
predatory raids must be met with 
every resource a Hive could muster. 
In the cooperative society the fate 
of each could be the destiny of all. 

/ must go topside immediately, 
he told himself. / must take per-

sonal command at the center of our 
protective efforts. 

Moving briskly, he went out to a 
nearby communal washroom, 
showered with several chemically 
neutered female workers, used a 
hive-made depilatory on his face 
and returned to his personal cell. 
There he dressed in heavier Outside 
garments— tan trousers, a white 
cotton shirt and dark gray sweater, 
a light-brown jacket over that. He 
put on socks and a pair of Hive- 
made leather shoes. As an after- 
thought he took a small foreign pis- 
tol from a desk drawer and slipped 
it into his pocket. The Outsider 
weapon had a greater range than a 
stunwand and would be familiar to 
the intruders, recognizable by them 
if a threat were needed. 

He went out then down the fa- 
miliar galleries and corridors with 
their hum of Hive activities. The 
level’s hydroponics rooms were on 
his way, their doors open to permit 
easy access for harvesters. He 
glanced in as he passed, noted how 
swiftly the routine was progressing. 
Hide baskets were being filled with 
soybeans, two workers to a basket. 
An Outsider might have interpreted 
the scene as one of confusion, but 
there was no squabbling, no con- 
versation. No workers collided with 
each other; no baskets were spilled. 
Filled baskets were being slid 
smoothly into the dumbwaiter slots 
in the far wall, there to go up to 
processing. Any necessary signals 
were conveyed by silent hand mo- 
tions. When examined in the light 
of Hive awareness, the giant rooms 
were a collection of evidence — all 
of which pointed to supremely ef- 
fective organization. These were 



chemically conditioned workers, ef- 
fectively neutered, none of them 
hungry (feeding conveyors were 
only a few steps away down the 
main gallery) and they worked in 
the certain awareness that what 
they did was vital for the entire 
Hive. 

Hellstrom’s own progress past 
the harvesting became a kind of ele- 
gant dance through entering and 
emerging workers. No precise sche- 
duling of crews was required here. 
Workers left when hungry or over- 
come by fatigue. Others entered to 
fill the gaps. All knew what was re- 
quired of them. 

At the elevator, which was one of 
the older, upper-level models with a 
visibly jerking motion at the open 
doorways, he was delayed for a mo- 
ment while a planting crew filed 
past him, headed for the hydropon- 
ics rooms with selected seedstock 
for replanting. There must be no 
delay in maintenance of the food 
cycle that lay at the very base of 
their survival. 

Hellstrom stepped into the open 
gap of the elevator doorway when 
space appeared on an upbound car. 
The heavy animal odor of the Hive, 
which the scrubbing systems erased 
from vented air exchanged Out- 
side, was strong in the elevator, a 
sign that leaks were developing 
far down in the shaft and would 
have to be repaired. Maintenance 
was a constant drain, but could not 
be ignored even now. He made a 
mental note to inquire about shaft 
maintenance. Within two minutes 
he was in the sub-basement of the 
barn-studio, his attention concen- 
trated once more on the immediate 
emergency.

We must not consign these new 
intruders to the vats too soon, he 
told himself. 

VI 

From Nils Hellstrom’s 
diar^: In the oral tradition, 
which spanned more than 100 
years before our progenitors 
began their first written re- 
cords, it was said that the 
refusal to waste any colony 
protein dated from our earliest 
beginnings. 1 have come to 
doubt this. Outsider reactions 
indicate it is no more than a 
pleasant myth. My brood- 
mother likened the later 
practice of wasting nothing 
to the openness we of the Hive 
have with each other. The vats 
were for her a beautiful 
metaphor of uninhibited in- 
ternal communication and, 
as she often said: In this way, 
when one dies, no secret dies 
with her — whatever each has 
learned will be contributed to 
the success of the whole. Noth- 
ing in the more than 200 years 
of our written records calls 
the original myth into question 
and I will not do so now in 
our open councils. Thus, I 
conceal something in the name 
of a myth that strengthens us. 
Perhaps, this is how religions 
begin. 

I N THE Hive-head sub-base- 
ment caution became visible. 
A ladder of Hive-steel was an- 
chored in one corner of the open 
area beneath the baffles and sound- 
dampers of the floor supports. The 



ladder led upward through the 
baffles to a concealed trapdoor that 
opened into a cubicle of a com- 
munal toilet in the barn’s base- 
ment. A concealed screen at the top 
of the ladder slid into position 
when a worker climbed to that 
point. The screen revealed whether 
the cubicle was occupied. A re- 
mote locking system secured the 
cubicle’s door when a worker was 
emerging. 

There were secondary monitor- 
ing screens at the base of the 
ladder and a watchworker was on 
duty there. The worker waved Hell- 
strom ahead, signaling that no 
Outsiders were in the studio area. 
The ladder was attached to a wall 
of one of the giant ventilation ducts 
that ended in the barn roof. He 
felt subtle vibrations as he climbed. 
He emerged from the cubicle 
presently and into an empty wash- 
room, which gave him passage into 
the studio’s actual basement, a 
space of wardrobe stores, film 
stores, editing, processing facilities 
for film, dressing rooms and make- 
up areas, props ... By Outsider 
standards, all would have seemed 
normal. Workers were going about 
their activities in the area, but 
they ignored him. Ordinary stairs 
at the end of a long hallway gave 
entrance through a sound-baffle 
system into a double-doored lock 
passage and thence to the main 
studio, which took up most of the 
barn’s cavernous interior. 

From the permanent min- 
utes of the Hive Council: Pre- 
sent computations indicate 
that the Hive will begin to feel 
swarming pressures when it

GALAXY 



passes a population of 60,000. 
Without some such protection 
as Project 40 would offer, we 
cannot permit such a swarming 
to occur. For all the ingenuity 
of our specialists, we are 
helpless before the combined 
might of the Outside. Its 
killing machines would crush 
us. The total dedication of our 
workers would send them to 
fall by the thousands in a 
suicidal attempt to insure the 
future of our kind. But we are 
few and they are many. The 
unreasioning brutality of 
nature’s underlying plan must 
be stayed for this time of pre- 
paration. Some day, given the 
potency of some such weapon 
as represented by Project 40, 
we wilt be able to emerge, and 
if our workers die on that 
day they will die with reason 
— through selflessness, not 
through greed. 



«^HEY are, as usual, firm 
X and polite — but evasive,” 
Janvert said, turning from the 
telephone. 

It was daylight outside Clovis’s 
apartment now and she had 
dressed in preparation for the 
specific summons they both knew 
would come soon. 

“They told you to be patient,” 
Clovis said. She had returned to 
her favorite position on the long 
couch and sat with her feet tucked 
under her. 

“One thing more,” Janvert said. 
“Peruge himself is going to head 
this team. Old Jollyvale doesn’t 
like that one bit.” 



“You think he wanted this one 
himself?” 

“God, no! But he’s Operations 
Director. With Peruge in the field 
Jollyvale can’t give orders. He’s 
effectively no longer Operations 
Director. That he doesn’t like.” 

“It’s definite about Peruge?” 

“No doubt.” 

“That explains why they’re not 
being very informative.” 

“I suppose so.” Janvert crossed 
to the couch and sat beside her, 
taking her hand in his and rubbing 
the warm skin absently. “I’m 
scared,” he said. “I’m really scared 
for the first time in this business. 
I’ve always known they didn’t give 
one particle of a damn about us, 
but Peruge — ” Janvert swallowed 
convulsively. “1 think he takes a 
positive pride in how many people 
he can waste and he doesn’t care 
whose people they are — ours or 
theirs.” 

“Don’t let him know how you 
feel, for God’s sake,” Clovis said. 

“Oh, I won’t. I’ll be the usual 
happy-go-lucky Shorty, always 
ready with a quip and a smile.” 

“Do you think we’ll be going out 
today?” 

“Tonight at the latest.” 

“I’ve often wondered about 
Peruge,” she said. “I’ve wondered 
who he actually is. That funny 
damned name and everything.” 

“At least he has a name,” Jan- 
ve~t said. “The Chief, now — ” 
“Don’t even think it,” she 
warned. 

“Haven’t you ever wondered if 
we really work for the govern- 
ment?” he asked. “Or whether our 
bosses represent an over-govern- 
ment behind the visible one.” 



PROJECT 40

“If you’re talking about what 
I think you're talking about I 
don’t want to know anything about 
it,” she said. 

“That’s a good, safe attitude,” 
he said. He dropped her hand, 
stood up and returned to his restless 
pacing. 

Clovis was right, of course. This 
place was bugged. They’d know 
precisely where to call for him. 
No helping that. When you worked 
to make the world a fishbowl you 
lived in a fishbowl. The trick was 
to become one of the fish watchers. 

From the Hive Manual: In 
the selection of workers, 
breeders and the various kinds 
of specialists, in the develop- 
ment of a Hive consciousness 
through all of the chemical 
and manipulative devices at 
our disposal, the blueprint of 
our cooperative society is 
etched with a potential for 
permanence that must be 
monitored with the greatest 
caution. Here each generation 
comes into the world as a 
continuation of the previous 
one, each individual a mere 
extensfon of the rest. It is in 
the consequences of that ex- 
tension that we must build our 
eventual place in the universe. 

HELLSTROM emerged 
into the open cavern of the 
studio a young woman production 
assistant, who had been working 
with a glass-enclosed beehive 
nearby, saw him and waved to 
attract his attention. Hellstrom 
hesitated, torn between the desire 
to go immediately up to the com- 



mand post aerie and recognition of 
a need to maintain an air of un- 
broken continuity in Hive-suppor- 
tive work. He recognized the young 
woman, of course — one of the 
lesser-crew who could front on 
occasion for limited contact with 
the Outsiders who came to look 
into the film work for legitimate 
reasons. She was one of the Niles- 
8 genetic line — the poor eyesight in 
that line would have to be cor- 
rected in the breeding processes. 
The strain was also susceptible to 
Outsider tastes, as was the Fancy 
line. 

He noted members of the second 
film crew standing around the 
glassed beehive, their arms folded. 
Everything about the scene spelled 
a delay. That could be costly. 
Hellstrom weighed his various 
problems. Old Harvey could be 
trusted to obey his orders. The 
money represented by this film 
equaled a vital resource. Hell- 
strom shifted direction in mid- 
stride, headed toward the produc- 
tion assistant and her idle crew. 
She had a plain face not helped 
by large granny glasses and blond 
hair pulled back in a severe chi- 
gnon. But she had a full figure and 
was obviously fertile. Hellstrom 
wondered idly if she had been ex- 
amined yet for her personal 
breeding potential. 

Using her Outside name, he 
spoke as he came up to her: “What 
is it, Stella?” 

“We’re having some unexpected 
trouble with this beehive and 1 
wanted to call Fancy in for as- 
sistance. But I was told you have 
her on another assignment from 
which she cannot be released.” 




52 



GALAXY 



“That’s true,” Hellstrom said, 
realizing that someone had taken 
him literally in his private instruc- 
tions to keep Fancy under close 
surveillance. “What’s happening 
with your bees?” 

“They’re balling on the queen 
every time we try to get her exposed 
for photographing. The last time 
that happened Fancy told us to 
call her — said she might be able to 
help.” 

“Did she give you an alternative 
to calling her?” 

“She said to try a tranquilizer in 
their feeder and in their air.” 

“Have you done this?” 

“We’d like to have them more 
active.” 

“I see. Did Fancy tell you what 
might be causing the trouble?” 

“She thinks it’s something in the 
air — maybe atmospheric electricity 
or a chemical emitted by our 
bodies.” 

“Can we shoot around these bees 
for now?” 

“Ed thinks we can. He wanted 
to call you earlier and see if you’d 
be available for one of the lab 
sequences in which you appear.” 

“When would he want to shoot 
it?” 

“Tonight, probably by around 
eight o’clock.” 

Hellstrom fell silent, considering 
all his manifest problems. Then: 
“I think 1 can be ready for that 
shooting by eight. Tell Ed to set 
up for it. I’ve had my daysleep and 
can work all night if need be.” He 
turned away. That should keep 
things here on an even keel, but he 
saw the bees at once as a metaphor 
of his own Hive. If the Hive became 
too upset things could get out of 



hand. Workers might take action 
on their own. He signaled to a 
boom operator in the center of the 
studio, pointed to himself and to 
the loft that gave entrance to the 
command aerie. 

The boom cage on its long arm 
swung down to the studio floor 
with all the silent grace of a mantis 
reaching for its prey. Hellstrom 
stepped into the cage and it wafted 
him upward, swung in a wide arc 
and deposited him at the edge of 
the loft floor. As he stepped out, 
Hellstrom reflected on how admir- 
ably this device served the needs 
of both security and of cover. No 
one could get up to the loft without 
the help of a trusted boom opera- 
tor, yet it was the most natural 
thing to think of a boom as an 
elevator and to use that as excuse 
for leaving no other access into the 
security section. 

T he loft had been set up with a 
central well running for half 
the length of the barn along its 
longest dimension. The other half 
concealed the outlets for ventila- 
tors, with a bypass for visual 
examination of the valley’s upper 
reaches. Slide ropes had been 
coiled neatly at even spacings along 
the edge of the loft floor, each rope 
secured to one of the stanchions of 
the guard rail. The ropes offered 
an emergency access to the studio 
floor. Neither the ropes nor the 
inner wall behind the walkway— 
nor the doors into the various 
security stations were visible from 
the studio floor. 

Hellstrom walked along the 
open area, noting a slight smell of 
dust, which alerted him to remind 



PROJECT 40 



53 



the cleaning crews that the studio 
must be kept free of dust. The 
catwalk with its view down into the 
multiple activities in the studio, led 
him along the soundproofed wall 
to an end door with both sound and 
light baffles. 

He let himself into Old Harvey’s 
station through the dark passage of 
the baffle. It was gloomy inside 
and filled with the smells of out- 
side, which came in through open 
louvers at the end. An arc of green- 
glowing repeater screens had been 
installed along the inner wall 
against a thermite-bomb destruc- 
tion system that could burn out 
the entire barn right down to 
the non-inflammable mucilaginous 
quick-plugs that could be triggered 
to seal off the Hive-head. The 
present emergency made Hellstrom 
acutely aware of all these prepara- 
tions — they had been a part of Hive 
awareness for many years. 

Old Harvey looked up from the 
console as Hellstrom entered. The 
old man was gray-haired and had 
a big, forward-thrust, face like a 
Saint Bernard’s. He even had 
dewlaps at the edges of his jawline 
to accent the likeness. His eyes 
were widely spaced, brown and 
deceptively mild. Hellstrom had 
once seen Old Harvey behead a 
hysterical worker with one sweep 
of a meat cleaver- but the mem- 
ory dated back to his childhood 
and that hysterical line had been 
weeded out of the Hive’s breeding 
stock. 

“Where’s our Outsider?’’ Hell- 
strom asked. 

“He had something to eat a 
while back, then crawled off the 
hilltop,’’ Old Harvey said. “He’s 



working his way toward the upper 
end of the valley now. If he sta- 
tions himself where 1 think he will 
we’ll be able to watch him directly 
with binoculars. We’re keeping all 
the lights out inside, of course, to 
reduce the chance that he’ll notice 
activity up here.’’ 

Good, cautious thinking, Hell- 
strom agreed. He asked, “Have 
you reviewed the Porter material? 
1 noticed earlier that you — ’’ 

“I’ve reviewed it.’’ 

“What’s your opinion?’’ 

“Same sort of approach, clothing 
designed to give him concealment 
in the grass. Want to bet his cover 
is that he’s a birdwatcher?’’ 

“I think I’d win.’’ 

“Too much professionalism 
about him,” Old Harvey said. He 
studied one of the console screens, 
pointed and said, “There he is, 
just like I expected.” 

The screen showed the intruder 
crawling under a stand of bushes 
for a view down the length of the 
valley. 

“Is he carrying a weapon?” 
Hellstrom asked. 

“Our sensors indicate not. I 
think he has a flashlight and a 
pocketknife in addition to those 
binoculars. Look at that. There are 
ants up there on the ledge and he 
doesn’t like them. See how he’s 
brushing them off his arm.” 

“Ants? How long since we’ve 
swept that area?” 

“A month or so. Do you want it 
checked?” 

“No. Just have it noted that it 
may be time for another sweep 
there by a small crew. We need 
several nests in the newer hydro- 
ponics sections.” 



54 



GALAXY 



“Right.” Old Harvey nodded 
and turned to relay instructions by 
hand signal to one of his assistants. 
“That Porter was a strange one. 
I’ve been reviewing what he said. 
He told us quite a bit, realty.” 

“He was in the wrong business,” 
Hellstrom agreed dryly. 

“What do you think they’re 
after?” Old Harvey asked. 

“We’ve somehow attracted the 
attention of an official agency,” 
Hellstrom said. “They don’t have 
to be after anything except satis- 
faction for their own brand of 
paranoia.” 

Old Harvey grimaced, shud- 
dered. “I don’t like the feeling of 
this. Nils.” 

“Nor I.” 

“Are you sure you’ve made the 
right decision?” 

“To the best of my ability. Our 
first step must be to pick up this 
pair. One of them must know more 
than the late Mr. Porter.” 

“I sure hope you’re right. Nils.” 

Vll 

From Nils Hellstrom' s 
diary: Three of our younger 
geneticists were in among the 
fertile females again today 
and some of the older colonists 
in genetics complained. I had 
to explain to them once more 
that it was unimportant. The 
breeding impulse cannot be 
suppressed in active key work- 
ers who require the full func- 
tioning of their mental abilities. 
1 have been known to indulge 
myi..:lf thus from time to time 
and the older genetics special- 
ists know this very well. They 



were really complaining about 
me, of course. When wilt they 
ever understand that genetic 
manipulation has very severe 
limits, given our present stage 
of development? Luckily the 
older ones are dying out. Our 
own truism applies here: Into 
the vats old, out of the vats 
new. Any offspring from this 
latest foray wilt be watched 
closely, of course. Talent is 
where you find it. We all know 
how desperately the Hive needs 
new talent. 

M ERRIVALE did not like the 
tone of voice Peruge was 
using over the telephone, but 
managed to conceal this fact under 
an even flow of reasonable re- 
sponses. Peruge was angry and 
was not attempting to hide the 
fact. To Merrivale, Peruge re- 
presented the one major obstacle 
between himself and another 
promotion. Merrivale thought he 
understood Peruge very well, but 
felt offended by the other man’s 
superior position in the Agency. 

Merrivale had been called away 
from the early afternoon briefing 
session that had been set up for 
the new teams being sent out to 
Oregon. He had left the meeting 
reluctantly, but without delay. One 
did not keep Peruge waiting. 
Peruge was one of the chosen few 
who had daily face-to-face contact 
with the Chief. He might even 
know the Chiefs real identity. 

A letterknife in the form of a 
cavalry saber lay on the smooth 

f ray blotter of Merrivale’s desk, 
le picked it up, pricked at the 
blotter with the sharp tip while he 



PROJECT 40 



55 



listened, gouging deeply when the 
conversation took a painful turn. 

“That was earlier in the month,” 
Dzule,” Merrivale said, knowing 
the explanation was insufficient, 
“and we did not know as much 
then as we know now.” 

“What do we know now?” 
The question was biting and 
adcusatory. 

“We know there’s someone out 
there who does not hesitate to 
make our people simply — disap- 
pear.” 

“We already knew that.” 

“But we had not gauged the 
extent of our opposition’s deter- 
mination to defy us.” 

“Do we have so many people 
that we can just waste them find- 
ing out such important facts?” 
Peruge demanded. 

The hypocrite . Merrivale 
thought. Nobody has wasted more 
agents than Peruge. He gave me 
the explicit orders that cost us 
these teams. 

Merrivale dug a deep gouge in 
the blotter, frowned at the dis- 
figuration of the surface. He re- 
minded himself to have the blotter 
replaced as soon as this call was 
completed. “Dzule, none of our 
agents believes this business is a 
safe one. They know the chances 
they take.” 

“But do they know the chances 
you take with them?” 

“That’s unfair,” Merrivale 
blurted and wondered what Peruge 
was doing. Why this abrupt at- 
tack? Was there trouble upstairs?” 

“You’re a fool, Merrivale,” 
Peruge said. “You’ve lost us three 
good people.” 

“My orders were explicit and 



you know it,” Merrivale said. 

“And given those orders — you 
did what you thought best.” 

<<^JATURALLY.” Merri- 
vale could feel sweat 
collecting under his collar and 
rubbed his neck. “We had no way 
of knowing precisely what had hap- 
pened to Porter. You told me to 
send him in alone. Those were 
your very words.” 

“And when Porter— Just van- 
ished?” 

“You said yourself that he 
could have had personal reasons 
for disappearing.” 

“What personal reasons? Porter’s 
record was one of the best.” 

“You said he’d quarreled with 
his — wife.” 

“Did 1 say that? I don’t re- 
member that at all.” 

So that's the way it is, Merri- 
vale thought. His stomach felt 
painfully knotted. “You know 
you offered that as a possible rea- 
son for sending in a double team 
with identical orders to replace 
them.” 

“I don’t know anything of the 
kind, Merrivale. You’ve sent 
Depeaux and Grenelli down that 
Oregon rathole and you sit there 
making excuses. When Porter was 
missed you should have originated 
an official inquiry for a vacationer 
believed to have been last seen in 
that region.” 

So that’s going to be our new 
approach, Merrivale thought. And 
if it succeeds Peruge gets the credit. 
If it fails I get the blame. Neat. 

Merrivale said, “I presume that’s 
the line of attack you’ll take when 
you get out to Oregon.”

“You know damned well it is.” 
The Chief himself is probably 
listening to this, Merrivale thought. 
Oh, God, why did I ever get into 
this business? 

“Have you told the new teams 
yet that I’ll be leading them per- 
sonally?” Peruge asked. 

“I was briefing them when you 
called.” 

“Very well. I’ll be leaving 
within the hour and I’ll meet the 
new teams in Portland.” 

“I’ll tell them.” Merrivale 
spoke with weary resignation. 

“And tell them — and I want it 
emphasized — that this new opera- 
tion must be handled with the 
utmost discretion. There will be 
no grandstand plays, understood? 
Hellstrom has powerful friends 
and I don’t mind telling you that 
this ecology issue is explosive. 
Hellstrom has said all of the right 
things to the right people and they 
think he’s some kind of ecological 
messiah. Luckily there are others 
who realize he’s a fanatical mad- 
man and I’m sure we’ll prevail. 
Understand me?” 

“Perfectly.” Merrivale did not 
try to conceal his bitterness now. 
The Chief was listening to Peruge. 
No doubt of that. The whole thing 
was a staged performance — pre- 
paration of the sacrificial goat. 
The goat’s name was, of course, 
Merrivale. 

“I doubt very much that you 
understand me perfectly,” Peruge 
said, “but it’s likely that you 
understand me well enough to fol- 
low the orders I’ve just given you 
without any more disgusting 
errors. See to it at once.” 

A sharp click closed the line. 



Merrivale sighed, replaced the 
receiver in its cradle on the elabo- 
rate scrambling phone. The signs 
were clear. He must juggle his 
own hot potato. If he dropped it 
— or if anyone else dropped it — 
fingers would point in only one 
direction. Well, he had been in this 
position before, just as he had 
placed others in the identical posi- 
tion. There was only one safe re- 
sponse. He must delegate authority, 
but do it so subtly that everything 
would still appear to be in his own 
hands. The logical candidate was 
Shorty Janvert. As a first step. 
Shorty would be named Number 
Two on this project, right under 
Dzule Peruge himself. Peruge 
had not specified whom he wanted 
as Number Two. That had been a 
mistake on his part. If Peruge 
changed the assignment, an action 
he might very well take, he would 
have to assume responsibility for 
everything his new segundo did. 
Shorty was a logical choice. 
Peruge had made it clear on 
several occasions that he did not 
fully trust Janvert. But the little 
man was imaginative and resource- 
ful. The choice could be defended. 



From the Hive Manual: The

source of freedom in any

has its neutered workers, the 
neutering being maintained be- 
hind a mask of actual fertility 
from which real offspring 
come. But such offspring 
have no share in the free crea- 
tive life of the wild society and 
thus are effectively neutered. 
Such workers can always be

recognized. They are not 
burdened with intellect, with 
unrestricted emotion or in- 
dividual identity. They are lost 
in a mass of creatures like 
themselves. In this neither our 
Hive nor the insects are giving 
the universe anything new. 
What the insects have and 
what we are copying is the 
society formed in such a way 
that its workers toil together 
to create the illusive Utopia — 
the perfect society. 

I T TOOK Hellstrom’s camera 
crew almost six hours to shoot 
the new tab sequence with mice 
and wasps. Even then Hellstrom 
was not satisfied that the crew had 
caught the effect he wanted on 
film. He had become very sensitive 
to the artistic merit of what the 
Hive created. The demands 
for excellence he was making now 
went far beyond the implicit know- 
ledge that quality brought more in- 
come to the Hive. He wanted qual- 
ity for its own sake for every aspect 
and expression of the Hive. 

Quality of specialists, quality of 
life, quality of creations — all were 
interrelated. 

Hellstrom had himself boom- 
lifted to the aerie after the shooting 
was finished. He tried to conceal 
his worries over the latest report 
on the nightsweep. Because he had 
been in this sequence he had been 
tied to the set during the most im- 
portant part of the sweep. It was 
still many hours to dawn and one 
problem had not been solved — the 
female who had accompanied their 
captive intruder remained at large. 
One of the Hive’s chief concerns 



had always been to produce work- 
ers who could front for it with 
the Outside — incorruptible workers 
who would not betray even by 
chance what lay beneath Guarded 
Valley and its surrounding hills. 
Hellstrom wondered now if the 
present problem might not have 
uncovered a breeding defect some- 
where in the personnel charged 
with the sweeps. The male intruder 
had been picked up easily beyond 
the bordering trees of the west 
meadow. A sweep detail had en- 
veloped the camper almost im- 
mediately afterward, but it had 
somehow missed the female. That 
she could escape had not seemed 
possible, but none of the sweep- 
workers had even smelled her 
trail. 

Many key security workers were 
in the aerie command post when 
Hellstrom entered. They noted his 
entrance, but stayed at their jobs. 
Hellstrom scanned the dimly 
lighted room with its arc of re- 
peater screens, its little clutches of 
workers discussing the problem. 
Saldo was there, dark in the man- 
ner of his breeder mother. Fancy, 
but with the harsh hawk features 
of his Outsider father. (That was 
one thing Fancy did well, Hell- 
strom reminded himself. She 
bred Outside at every opportunity 
and the resultant new genes were 
prized by the Hive.) Old Harvey’s 
post at the Security console had 
been taken over by a younger male 
of Fancy’s line. He took the name 
of Timothy Hannsen in his Out- 
side guise, which so far had seen 
limit^ use. Hannsen had been 
chosen for possible future training 
as a front because his penetrating

good looks tended to overpower 
the conscious balance of Outsider 
females. His sharply incisive mind 
also made him particularly valu- 
able in a crisis. The trait was true 
of many in Fancy’s line, particu- 
larly so in Saldo. Hellstrom had 
high hopes for Saldo, who had 
been taken on as a special educa- 
tional charge by Old Harvey. 

Hellstrom paused inside the 
door to guage conditions in the 
aerie. Should he take over? The 
workers would defer to him at the 
slightest indication that he was 
assuming command. Brood mother 
Trova’s decision had never been 
really questioned. They always 
sensed how much more potent 
was his commitment to the Hive, 
how much more effective his deci- 
sions. They might disagree at 
times and occasionally even prev- 
vail over him, but a subtle air of 
deference remained even when 
they voted him down in Council. 
And when, as often happened, his 
view proved later to have been the 
correct one, his hold upon them 
became even stronger. It was a 
situation toward which Hellstrom 
maintained a constant mistrust. 

No worker is perfect, he told 
himself. The Hive itself must be 
supreme in all things. 



HARVEY stood against 
% the wall at Hellstrom’s left, 

s' arms folded, his face underlighted 
by glowing screens that produced 
the illusion that he had been cast 
from green stone There was move- 
ment in his eyes, though. Old 
Harvey was watching the room 
J critically. Hellstrom crossed to his 
side, glanced once at the dewlapped 



old face and then at the consoles. 
■‘Any sign of her yet?” 

“No.” 

“Didn’t we have her under 
constant infra-surveillance?” 
“Radar and sonics, too,” Old 
Harvey muttered. 

“Did she have instruments to 
detect us?” 

“She tried to use her radio, but 
we jammed it.” 

“That alerted her?” 

“Probably.” Old Harvey sud- 
denly sounded tired and displeased. 

“But she had no other instru- 
ments?” 

“The vehicle had a small radar- 
type speed-trap warning device. 

I think she may have detected our 
surveillance that way, too. 

“But how could she slip through 
our sweep?” 

“Our people are reviewing 

the tapes again. They think she 
could have gone searching for her 
companion and been lost in the 
general confusion our sweep 

created on the instruments.” 

“The sweep should have picked 
her up despite any such confusion.” 
Old Harvey turned, looked di- 
rectly at him. “So I told them.” 
“And they overruled you.” 

Old Harvey nodded. 

“What do they believe hap- 
pened?” Hellstrom asked. 

“She took a calculated risk and 
went right into the midst of our 
searchers.” 

“Her smell would have given 
her away.” 

“So I said — and they agreed. 
They then suggested she slipped 
away from the truck to the north, 
using it as a shield. Their thought 
is that she walked softly to hide 



PROJECT 40 



59 



her movements in the background 
static. There was a time gap be- 
tween dark and the moment our 
sweep reached her vicinity. She 
could have done it. She had two 
choices — get away or slip up on us 
from another direction. They 
think she’s out there stalking us.” 
‘‘And you don’t agree with that?” 
Heilstrom asked. 

‘‘Not that one,” Old Harvey said. 
‘‘Why?” 

‘‘She wouldn’t slip up on us.” 
‘‘But why?” 

“We hit her hard with the low- 
frequency. She was twitchy and 
nervous all afternoon, much too 
nervous to come for us.” 

“How do you know what her 
reserves of courage might be?” 

“1 watched her.” 

“She didn’t look like your type, 
Harvey.” 

“Make your joke, Nils. I 
watched her most of the after- 
noon.” 

“So this is no more than your 
opinion from personal observa- 
tion?” 

“Yes.” 

“Why aren’t you pressing that 
opinion?” 

“I did.” 

“Given your choice, what action 
would you take?” 

“You really want to know?” 

“I do — or 1 wouldn’t ask.” 

“First, I think she’s slipped down 
to the northeast among those cat- 
tle in the pasture. I’m guessing that 
she knows cattle. There was some- 
thing about her — ” He wet his lips 
with his tongue. “If she knows 
cattle, she could have moved 
among them with no problems. 
They would have masked her smell 



and provided all the cover she 
needed.” 

“No one here agrees with you?” 

“They say those are range cattle 
and that they would have spooked 
at the first smell of her. We would 
have detected a stampede.” 

“And your response?” 

“A lot of spooking goes to 
whether a cow can smell your 
fear. We know that. We use that 
factor ourselves. If she wasn’t 
afraid of them and moved softly — 
well, we can’t just close our eyes 
to the possibility that she may 
have done so.” 

“They don’t want to search 
among the cattle, though?” 

“They’re bothered by the com- 
plications of a sweep down there. 
If we send workers they’re sure 
to get out of hand and kill a few 
head of those cows. Then we have 
local problems.” 

“You still haven’t told me what 
you’d do.” 

“I’d send some of us. We’re 
trained to deal with the Outside. 
Some of us have lived out there. 
We have better control over the 
hunt response during a sweep.” 

Heilstrom nodded, spoke his 
thoughts aloud; “If she’s up here 
close to us she hasn’t a rabbit’s 
chance of getting away. But if 
she’s down there among tiiose 
cows — ” 

“You see what I mean,” Old 
Harvey said. 

“I’m astonished that the others 
don’t see it, too,” Heilstrom said. 
“Will you lead the search party, 
Harvey?” 

“Sure. 1 see you’re not calling 
it a sweep.” 

“I’d just as soon you went out 



60 



GALAXY 



and brought back only one thing.” 

“Alive?” 

“If at all possible. We’re not 
getting much from that other one.” 

“That’s what I heard. 1 was 
down there when they first started 
questioning him, but — well, that 
sort of thing bothers me. I guess 
I lived too long Outside.” 

“I have the same reaction,” 
Hellstrom said. “This is something 
better left to the younger workers 
who don’t even know the concept 
of mercy. He told me almost 
nothing when ! first questioned 
him. 

“Sure wish there were some 
other way,” Old Harvey said. He 
took a deep breath. “I’d best get 
about the — search.” 

“Choose your men and see to 
it.” 

Hellstrom watched the old man 
move out into the room, thought 
about the often sheer perversity of 
the young. The old possessed a 
special value for the Hive, a kind 
of balance that could not be denied. 
This incident was a sure demon- 
stration of their value. Old Harvey 
had known what to do. The young 
workers had not wanted to venture 
out into that night themselves, 
though, and had decided the action 
was unnecessary. 

Several of the younger male and 
female apprentices and the security 
workers of middle years had heard 
Hellstrom’s conversation with Old 
Harvey. They made a shame- 
faced show now of volunteering for 
the search. 

Old Harvey picked some of 
them, instructed them briefly. He 
made a special point of naming 
Saldo his second in command. That 



was good. Saldo displayed a 
devoted respect for Old Harvey and 
it was surprising that the younger 
worker had not taken his teacher’s 
side. 

The a.iswer came out in the 
briefing when Saldo said, “1 knew 
he was right, but you wouldn’t be- 
lieve me, either.” Apparently Saldo 
had sided with his teacher, but the 
others had lumped them both in 
one bag. 

Ever conscious of his role as 
educator. Old Harvey chided Saldo 
for this remark. “If you thought 
as you say you should have given 
your own arguments — not mine.” 

The troops filed out of the room 
properly chastened. 

Hellstrom smiled to himself. 
They were good stock and learned 
quickly. One had only to give them 
the correct example. In age is 
balance, his broodmother had 
been fond of saying. Youth, to her, 
had represented an extenuating 
circumstance which had always 
to be taken into account. 

Vlll 

The words of Nils Hell- 
strom: Of the billions of living 
things on Earth only man 
ponders his existence. His 
questions lead to torment, for 
he is unable to accept, as the 
insects do, that life’s only pur- 
pose is life itself. 

T YMIENA GRINELLI had 
not liked this assignment from 
the beginning. She hadn’t objected 
so much to working with Carlos 
(they had combined forces many 
times in the past) as she did to the 



PROJECT 40 



61 



time she would have to spend with 
him when they were not working. 
Carlos had been flashingly hand- 
some in his youth and had never 
accustomed himself to the gradual 
wearing away of his compelling 
attraction to women. 

She had known that the off-duty 
association would be a constant 
bout of sortie and parry. Grinelli 
didn’t fancy herself as a femme 
fatale, but she knew from exper- 
ience her own magnetism. She had 
a long face that might have been 
taken as ugly except for the per- 
sonality behind it. Her self shone 
through overlarge and startlingly 
green eyes. Her body was slender, 
the skin pale, and there was about 
her an air of profound sensitivity 
that fascinated many men, Carlos 
among them. Her hair was dark 
red-auburn and she tended to keep 
it confined in tight hats or berets. 

Tymiena was a family name and 
its original Slavic meaning had 
been: “a secret.” The name 

described her manner. She held 
herself in constant reserve. 

Merrivale had alerted 'her sense 
of danger originally by assigning 
only the two of them to the case. 
She had not liked what she had 
read in Porter’s accounts and in 
the reports accumulated under the 
label: the hellstrom file. Too 
many of these had been second- or 
third-hand. Too many of them 
were semi-official. They smacked 
of amateurism. Amateurs were a 
deadly indulgence in this business. 

“Only two of us?” she had ob- 
jected. “What about the local 
police? We could file a missing per- 
son report and—” 

“The Chief does not want that,” 



Merrivale had responded at once. 
“Did he say so specifically?” 
Merrivale’s face had darkened 
slightly at any reference to his 
well-known propensity for per- 
sonalized interpretation of orders. 
“He made himself abundantly 
clear. This matter is to be handled 
with the utmost discretion.” 

“A discreet local inquiry sounds 
to me well within that require- 
ment. Porter was in that area. He’s 
missing. These reports in the file 
indicate others may have disap- 
peared in that vicinity. This family 
of picnickers with the twin babies, 
for instance, they — ” 

“A logical explanation has 
been accepted for every such oc- 
currence, Tymiena.” Merrivale had 
interrupted. “Unfortunately logic 
and actuality do not always coin- 
cide. Our concern is for the actu- 
ality and, in our pursuit of it, we 
shall utilize our own tested 
resources.” 

“1 don’t like their logical ex- 
planations. 1 don’t give one particle 
of a damn what explanations local 
dumbheads may have accepted.” 
“Our own resources only.” 
“Which means we put our lives 
on the line again. What does Carlos 
say about this case?” 

“Why don’t you ask him? I’ve 
arranged a briefing for oh-eleven- 
hundred. Janvert and Carr will 
be here, as well.” 

“Are they in this?” 

“They’re in reserve.” 

“I don’t like that, either. 
Where’s Carlos?” 

“I believe he’s in Archives. You 
have almost an hour to explore this 
matter with him.” 

"Merde!" 



62 



GALAXY 



She had swept from the room. 

Carlos had been no more help- 
ful than Merrivale. The assign- 
ment had struck him as routine. 
But then, assignments tended to 
strike Carlos as cast in some 
familiar mold. His habitual 
response was a universal, clerkish 
thoroughness of preparation — 
read all the material, study all the 
plans. To find that Carlos was in 
Archives had not surprised her. 
He had an Archives mind. 



T he trip to Oregon and the 
cozy journey in the camper 
had been everything she had ex- 
pected — crawling hands and a 
crawling mind. She had finally 
told Carlos that she had contracted 
a serious venereal disease on her 
previous assignment. He refused 
to believe this. She had told him 
quite calmly then that if he per- 
sisted she would put a bullet into 
him. She had displayed the small 
Belgian automatic in the wrist 
holster she always wore. Something 
about the clear calmness of her 
manner had told him to believe 
her. But he had taken the rebuff 
in muttering bad grace. 

The job was another matter, 
though, and she had wished him 
luck when he took off in his ridic- 
ulous bird-watching clothes. All 
through the long day then, while 
she had been fulfilling her part 
of the “cover” by painting, she 
had grown increasingly nervous. 
There had been no particular thing 
upon which to focus her uneasiness, 
nothing concrete to explain it. 
The whole scene had bothered her, 
reeked of trouble. Carlos had been 



predictably imprecise about his 
estimate of return time. It all 
depended on what he saw in his 
preliminary scan of the farm. 

“Shortly after dark at the latest,” 
he had said. “You be a good wife 
and paint your pretty pictures 
while 1 go look for birds. When 1 
come back I’ll teach you all about 
the birds and the bees. 

“Carlos!” 

“Ah, my love, some day I shall 
teach you to say that exquisite 
name with true passion.” And 
the bastard had chucked her under 
the chin as he took his leave. 

Tymiena had watched him zig- 
zag his way up the grass-brown 
slope into the trees. The day al- 
ready was warm and filled with that 
special kind of insect-singing still- 
ness that spoke of more heat to 
come. Sighing, she had taken out 
her water-color materials. She 
actually was quite a good water- 
colorist and occasionally during 
the long day she had experienced 
real involvement in putting down 
the essence of the autumn fields. 
The golden browns were particu- 
larly warm and inviting. 

Shortly after midday, she put 
her painting aside temporarily 
and fixed herself a light lunch of 
sliced hardboiled eggs and yogurt, 
cold from the camper’s 'icebox. 
During the break, although the 
camper’s interior was oven hot, 
she stayed inside to check over 
the instruments. To her surprise, 
the speed-trap warning, which 
could ^ turned on its base and had 
a null indicator, showed radar 
activity in the direction of the farm. 
There was a clear signal aimed at 
the camper. 



PROJECT 40 



63 



Radar surveillance of her from 
the farm? 

She interpreted this as a danger 
sign and thought of going after 
Carlos to call him back. An alter- 
native was to warm up the radio 
and report the development to 
headquarters. She knew with a sure 
instinct that headquarters would 
make light of it. And Carlos had 
ordered her to stay with the 
camper. In the end she opted for 
neither course. Her own indecision 
added a frustrating accent to the 
nervousness that continued to 
afflict her throughout the after- 
noon. The sense of danger accumu- 
lated. She felt that something was 
warning her to get away. Leave the 
camper at least. The camper was 
a big, fat target. 

In the half-light of dusk, she 
folded up her painting tablet, 
dropped it and her paints on the 
cab seat and slipped into the seat 
at the radio. It took a moment 
to warm up and she checked the 
signal monitor, found a search- 
resonance fanning across her own 
frequency. When she keyed her 
transmitter, the search-resonance 
homed on her signal and jammed 
it. The monitor howled with the 
interference. She slapped the off- 
switch, stared toward the farm. 
The place was not visible from this 
parking spot, but she felt it out 
there as a malevolent presence. 

There was still no sign of Carlos. 

Darkness would be on her with- 
in minutes. She felt nervously for 
the little automatic in its wrist 
holster. 

What the hell was delaying 
Carlos? 

She turned out the camper’s 



lights, sat in the settling darkness. 
Radar from the farm’s direction. 
They jammed her radio. This case 
had turned nasty. She stood up, 
moved softly to the rear door, slip- 
ped out on the side opposite the 
farm. The van itself would shield 
her from that searching beam. She 
dropped to all fours and worked 
her way swiftly into the tall grass. 
She had seen cows far down in the 
pasture below her and headed for 
them with a sure instinct. She 
had grown up on a Wyoming cattle 
ranch and, while she preferred 
approaching them on horseback, 
she felt no threat from them. The 
threat was behind her, somewhere 
up at Hellstrom’s farm. The cows 
would offer her a masking con- 
fusion, concealment from that 
radar sweep. If Carlos returned, 
he would turn on the camper’s 
lights. She would see them from a 
safe distance in the pasture land. 

Somehow she did not expect 
Carlos to return. This whole situ- 
ation did not make sense, had not 
made sense from the beginning, 
but she trusted her own instinct 
for self-preservation. 

The words of Nils Hellstrom: 
This primeval planet Earth 
is an arena of continual con- 
test where only the most versa- 
tile and resourceful endure. 
On this testing ground where

dominates our Earth today 
and exploits his dominion well. 
With each new generation 
come new experiments in 
shape and function, transform- 
ing him into specters as limit- 
less as the imagination of the 
insane. Yet, what this witness 
can do, we of the Hive can do 
because we are witness of him. 

a D HARVEY ted his troop 
from a concealed perimeter 
exit at the northern edge of the 
Hive. Sod rolled back, a stump 
with a mucilage-seated soil plug 
folded outward on a silent hinge 
and the troop emerged into the 
night. They were lightly clad in 
dark gray and the night was cold, 
but they ignored the chill. Each 
carried a stunwand and wore a 
night-vision mask with a powerful 
infrared emitter of Hive manu- 
facture around its rim. They looked 
like a troop of skindivers and the 
wands were strange double-ended 
spears. 

The stump-plug was seated se- 
curely before they left it, all sign 
of their passage removed. 

They fanned out over the field 
and moved northward. 

Old Harvey had chosen twenty- 
three of the key workers, mostly 
aggressive males, and had seen 
to it that the females received 
hormones before he had issued 
his careful instructions in silent 
Hive-sign. 

They wanted this Outsider 
female alive. Nils needed the in- 
formation this female carried. 
She was probably down among the 
cows. The cows could be frightened 
off with a low stun, but none were 



to be killed. This was not a sweep 
— it was a search. Only the Out- 
sider female would go eventually 
into the vats from this venture 
and she only after she had given 
up the necessary information. 

It had been a long time since 
Old Harvey had participated in 
a hunt and he felt the excitement 
of it pumping in his veins. He sig- 
naled for Saldo to take the left 
flank and moved out of the right 
himself. The night air tasted of 
many scents — cattle, dust in the 
tall grass, raw earth, the subtle 
esthers of insects, a touch of tree 
resin. It was all there in his sensi- 
tive nostrils, but he could not 
separate out an odor that said the 
Outsider female was ahead of him. 
Nightsight would have to reveal 
her. 

Saldo had moved immediately 
out to his assigned position and 
Old Harvey relaxed. The young 
man was green, but his potential 
was enormous. Saldo was among 
the twenty or so who might some 
day step into Hellstrom’s sandals. 
He was one of the smaller, energy- 
saving new breed, dark and slim, 
filled with nervous energy and 
willingness to please, but with his 
own mind showing more strongly 
each day. He would be a power in 
the Hive some day — or might even 
take a swarm of his own out to 
start a new Hive. 

The searchers had spread into 
a wide fan, walking openly down 
into the pastureland. Old Harvey 
noted that the night was good for 
a hunt. Clouds were beginning to 
cover the sky, obscuring the late- 
rising, waning moon. The cattle 
could be seen easily in the night-

sight reHection. He kept his eyes 
on the scattered clumps of trees, 
however, ignoring the cattle for 
the moment. They passed one 
small herd with a minimal disturb- 
ance of the animals, although the 
warm smell of the cows excited 
the hunter drive in the entire troop. 
Saldo and two others searched 
through the herd, making sure 
the animals screened no Outsider. 

Hunt excitment could not be 
denied, though. It was evidenced 
by an increasing nervousness in 
the troop and an outflow of exter- 
nal hormones that began to spook 
the cattle. More and more indivi- 
dual cows and then whole groups of 
them snorted and ran off with a 
panicked thumping. 

Old Harvey began to regret that 
he had not included a selective 
hormone suppressant in his pre- 
parations. The subtle chemical 
signals one animal could send to 
another had their uses at times, 
but they introduced complexities 
now. He kept his attention on the 
trees, however, leaving the cattle 
for Saldo and the others to scan. 
Nightsight gave his surroundings 
a faint silver cast, as though the 
light came from within every 
object he saw. 

She will hear us coming and 
she will try to hide in a tree, he 
told himself. It's her style. 

He couldn’t say why or how he 
knew this from just his one after- 
noon’s observation, but he felt 
certain of it. She would hide in a 
tree. 

Old Harvey heard a nightbird 
call from far off to his right and 
felt his heartbeat quicken. He was 
not too old for the sweeps. Perhaps 



it would be good to go out occa- 
sionally with the workers. 

The words of Nils Hellstrom: 
Unlike other creatures who 
struggled against their envi- 
ronment, the insect learned 
early to seek its protective 
embrace. He created an end- 
less wardrobe of camouflage. 
He and his environment be- 
came one. When predators 
came he was nowhere to be 
found — so artistic were his 
methods of deception that 
predators could crawl upon 
his . body in their search for 
prey. He did not choose merely 
one means . of escape, but 
countless others. Not for him 
speed or the treetops, but both 
of these and more. 

T YMIENA saw one flank of 
the sweep just as the first 
searchers saw her, confirming Old 
Harvey’s prediction. She had 
tripped in a rabbit hole and 
sprained her left ankle early in 
her flight. The pain had forced 
her to make the climb into a low 
oak, where she had braced herself 
in a notch and taken off the shoe 
on the injured foot. She sat about 
twenty feet up, the tittle automatic 
held firmly in her right hand. A 
powerful pen-size flashlight was 
in her left hand, her thumb on its 
switch. 

The ankle throbbed with a fiery 
pain that made thought difficult. 
She wondered if she had broken 
a bone. 

Running cattle gave her the 
first indication of trouble. She 
heard the animals snorting above 



66 



GALAXY 



the pounding of their hooves as 
they passed. Then came a mysteri- 
ous swish-swish. The sound grew 
louder until it circled her tree and 
stopped. She could just make out 
the darker shadows of the hunters 
in the blackness. They had formed 
a rough circle all around her. It 
was obvious that she had been 
detected. In panic, she thumbed 
the flashlight switch, swept its beam 
in a short arc. She gasped, at her 
first sight of the nightmasks and 
stunwands, recognizing deadly 
menace. She began shooting with- 
out thinking. 

IX 

The words of Nils Hellstrom: 
Perhaps we will in time become 
as fully functional as are those 
we copy. We will develop faces 
without expression — with only 
eyes and mouths to keep 
our bodies alive. No muscles 
to smile or frown with — or in 
any way to betray what is 
lurking beneath the surface. 



T he little automatic erupted 
as a monstrous surprise to 
the Hive’s hunters. Five of them 
were dead before Tymiena was 
brought tumbling from the tree 
by a concentration of stuns. Old 
Harvey was among those killed, 
his nightmask shattered and a 
bullet in his brain. Saldo suffered 
a bullet burn on his jaw, but his 
shouted command brought order 
to the frightened workers. They 
had been full of hunt juice, as the 
old-timers put it, and the Outsider 
female’s attack had raised them to 



a deadly pitch. They leaped in to 
finish her off with their hands, 
but Saldo’s cry of command 
stopped them. In the end it was 
Hive discipline that kept them 
off her. 

Saldo issued swift orders. Some- 
one must run to inform Nils. The 
dead must be returned to the vats. 
That was what good workers de- 
served. Thus they became one with 
all. Into the vats old, out of the vats 
new. 

While his orders were being 
obeyed he kneeled to examine the 
unconscious female. Her flash- 
light still glowed in the grass. He 
pushed his nightmask back onto 
his head, used the flashlight to 
help his examination. Yes, she was 
still alive. It was difficult to conduct 
the examination calmly. He felt 
hate filling him. This one had 
harmed the Hive. Nils needed her, 
though. The Hive needed her. 
Saldo managed a kind of calm as 
he continued his examination. She 
appeared to have no broken bones. 
A painful ankle, obviously. It was 
swelling and discolored. Workers 
had suffered much worse, though, 
and had gone on with their tasks. 
He directed that her weapon be 
found and returned to the Hive. 

Old Harvey’s death neither 
saddened nor gladdened him. Such 
things occurred. Reality could not 
be avoided. Reality had placed him 
in command of the search troop 
and he was required to give correct 
orders. This was how Old Harvey 
had taught him to think and 
behave. 

The Outsider female had to be 
secured first. He judged that she 
could be revived for questioning. 



PROJECT 40 



67 



That would please Nils. It pleased 
Saldo now. He began to sense a 
greater interest in this female. 
She was possessor of fascinating 
odors. He sensed alien Outsider 
soaps and perfumes over faint, but 
familiar musks. He bent close to 
sniff at her, the first Outsider fe- 
male he had ever encountered in the 
wild. Beneath the dominant acrid- 
ity of her fear were exciting odors. 
He slipped a hand under her blouse, 
felt a breast, found it full and 
firm under a restraining garment. 
He knew about such garments 
from his training for key worker 
roles. It was called a bra and was 
fastened with metal hooks at the 
back. She was a true female, 
apparently no different from 
females of the Hive, and the avail- 
able evidence said she was fertile. 
How odd these wild Outsiders were. 
He moved his hand down under her 
waistband, explored the pubic 
hair and genitals, brought the hand 
out and smelled it. Yes, fertile. 
So it was true that Outsider 
females wandered around when 
they were fertile. Did they go on 
a mating hunt of some kind as a 
brood mother was supposed to do? 
The books, the films and the 
lectures of his education had not 
prepared him for the actuality, 
although he could rattle off the 
facts readily enough. She excited 
him and he wondered if Nils would 
entertain a suggestion that she be 
kept for breeding. It would be 
interesting to breed with her. 

A female in his band snarled at 
him then, a wordless sound of 
deep menace. Another said, “This 
Outsider female isn’t a breeder. 
What are you doing with her?” 



“I investigate,” Saldo said. “She 
is fertile.” 

The one who had snarled at him 
found her voice. “Many of these 
wild ones are fertile.” 

The other said, “She killed five 
of us. She’s fit only for the vats.” 
“Where she probably will go 
when we have finished questioning 
her,” Saldo said. He spoke with- 
out trying to conceal an abrupt 
feeling of sadness. This Outsider 
female would be destroyed by the 
questioning — no doubt of it. It 
was happening to the captive 
male. Such a waste. Her flesh 
would be good for nothing but 
the vats. 

H e arose, restored his 
nightmask to its position 
over his nose, said, “Bind her and 
carry her to the Hive. See that she 
does not escape. Two of you go to 
her vehicle. Bring it in for scaveng- 
ing. Erase its tracks. No sign must 
remain that she and her companion 
were in our vicinity. See to it.” 
The orders came from his mouth 
as Harvey had taught him, but 
Saldo felt a form of despair that 
such commands were necessary. 
The responsibilities of leadership 
had fallen upon him abruptly. A 
remote part of his awareness 
realized that Harvey’s choice of 
so young a worker as second in 
command on this search had been 
a training gesture. A promising 
young worker needed this experi- 
ence. Another part of Saldo’s 
awareness rested securely in his 
sense of competence. He was a 
specialist in Hive security. He 
trusted his own responses. He felt 
perfectly fitted for the task at 



68 



GALAXY 



hand — it was as though the entire 
Hive were reacting through his 
person. Harvey had lived beyond 
his day, had paid for a mistake 
with his life. It was a serious loss 
to the Hive. Nils would have the 
news of it by now and there would 
be concern, but for the moment, 
Saldo knew he must proceed along. 
His was the seat of command. 

“Those of you without other 
tasks,” he said, “see that no sign 
of our activities remains here. I 
do not know alt of your talents as 
Old Harvey did, but you know 
them. Divide yourselves according 
to your abilities. No one of you is 
to return to the Hive until what 
must be is done. I will remain until 
the last to inspect the job.” 

He stooped, recovered the flash- 
light he had left beside the Out- 
sider female, extinguished it, put 
it into his pocket. Workers already 
had bound the female and were 
ready to take her back to the Hive. 
It saddened Saldo that he would 
not see her again. He didn’t think 
he wanted to watch the questioning. 
A sudden anger at Outsider stupid- 
ity shook him. They were such 
fools. She deserved whatever 
happened to her. 

Saldo glanced around at his 
people. They were busy obeying 
his orders and appeared content 
on the surface, but he sensed an 
air of uncertainty. They knew how 
young and untried he was. They 
obeyed out of habit. In truth, 
they were still obeying Harvey. 
But Harvey had made a fatal 
mistake. Saldo promised himself 
that he would not make such a 
mistake. 

“Get down on your hands and 



knees and be thorough,” he said. 
“Two of the nightmasks were 
shattered. There will be splinters 
to recover. Get them all.” 

Saldo wandered up through the 
tall grass toward the place where 
two of his troop already were 
readying the vehicle for removal 
to the Hive. She had come down 
this way, that Outsider female. 
How odd it was that they wandered 
around freely when they were 
fertile, as though they had no 
concern whatsoever about selecting 
the best male for breeding. In truth, 
they were not like a brood mother 
at all. They were merely wild, 
fertile females. Perhaps some day 
— when there were many Hives — 
such wild females would be cap- 
tured and put to proper breeding, 
or they would be neutered and 
employed in useful work. 

Some of the cattle that had fled 
the scene of disturbance had re- 
turned, drawn by curiosity, no 
doubt. The animals were bunching 
up in the open, below the place 
where his troop worked, and were 
facing the troop. The smell of 
blood and the noise had left them 
on edge, but they offered no threat. 
The cattle could not see Saldo’s 
workers, but his workers could 
see the cattle. Saldo held his stun- 
wand at the ready and moved to 
place himself between the cattle 
and his troop. A good imagination 
could guard against the unexpected. 
If the cattle stampeded toward his 
workers, the beasts would be 
knocked down by one sweep of 
his stunwand. 

Saldo paused periodically to 
stare across the rangeland toward 
the distant glow of the town, a 



PROJECT 40 



69 



dim reflection on clouds. It was 
unlikely anyone that far away had 
heard the shooting, but even if 
some had they would be sensible. 
Townsmen had learned to be ret- 
icent and cautious about Guarded 
Valley. The Hive possessed a 
buffer there, too, in the person of 
the district deputy sheriff, Lincoln 
Kraft. He was Hive-born and one 
of the most successful fronts the 
Hive had ever produced. Other 
Hive observers moved as ordinary 
Outsiders in the town. There were 
even more important fronts in 
the larger Outside world. Saldo 
had seen two when they visited the 
Hive — a Senator and a judge. They 
filled dangerous posts which some 
day would not be needed. 

The sounds of his troop busily 
carrying out his orders pleased 
Saldo. He sniffed at the night 
air, detected a smell of gunpowder. 
Only the Hive-trained would be 
likely to recognize that scent now. 
It was but a faint trace among 
many other odors. 

The cattle began to quiet down 
and a few left the bunched herds 
to graze. This annqyed Saldo. 
Bunched up, the cows did not offer 
too much temptation, but he knew 
how disturbed his workers were. 
One of them could conceivably take 
a lone cow. That must be pre- 
vented. This would be Hive land 
some day — the Hive might even 
have its own cattle. But for now 
such protein cost too much in plant 
energy. That kind of wastefulness 
must be left to the profligate Out- 
siders and their cattle must not be 
molested on this night. Nothing 
to attract unwanted attention must 
occur here. 



Saldo returned to his workers, 
moved among them, speaking in 
a low voice. They must not take 
any cattle. There must be time for 
the soil to conceal marks that 
had not been erased. No suspicious 
outsiders must appear here for as 
long as possible. 

Some day, Saldo told himself, 
there would be other Hives, many 
of them sprung from this one 
parent which he served and which 
now must conceal all trace of itself 
from the Outsiders. For now the 
Hive people must be cautious and 
guard their future. They owed 
this to generations of countless 
workers as yet unborn. 

The words of Nils Hellstrom: 
Our main breeding lines must 
be designed with the utmost 
attention to Hive necessities. 
In this we walk a much thinner 
edge than do the insects who 
provide us with our model for 
survival. Their life begins as 
ours — by the fertilization of 
a single cell — but the miracle 
of creation differs for us from 
that point on. An insect can re- 
produce four hundred and one 
billion, three hundred and sixty 
million of his kind in the time 
it takes a single human embryo 
to develop. We can increase 
our Hive birthrate many times 
over, but never can we hope to 
to match this proliferation. 



A WORKER came, waving to 
attract Saldo’s attention. 
There was still no sign of dawnlight, 
but the air had turned cold, as it 
often did here just before daybreak. 
The worker stopped in front of 



70 



GALAXY 



Saldo, spoke to him in a low voice. 

“Someone’s coming from the 
Hive." 

“Who?” 

“I think it is Nils himself.” 

Saldo turned his attention in the 
direction indicated by the worker, 
recognized the oncoming figure by 
his gait. Yes, it was Nils. He wore 
a nightmask, but carried no wand. 
Saldo put down a sense of relief 
tempered by a surge of displeasure. 
His decisions had been the correct 
ones, but Hellstrom had chosen to 
come to see. Saldo immediately 
chided himself. He could almost 
hear the reprimand in Harvey’s 
aging voice: Isn’t that what you 
would do? The leader of the Hive 
could do no less. The thought 
restored Saldo’s feeling of calm 
competence. 

Hellstrom stopped a few paces 
from Saldo, examined the scene 
before speaking. He noted with 
approval that Saldo seemed to be 
doing what was necessary. 

“Tell me what has happened,” 
Hellstrom finally said. 

“Have you had no report from 
the ones I sent to you?” 

“They reported, but I would 
prefer that the leader of this search 
troop give me his own assessment. 
Sometimes workers miss impor- 
tant things.” 

Saldo nodded. Yes, the procedure 
was wise. He recounted the dis- 
covery of the Outsider female, the 
shooting; he left out no detail. 

“Should your wound be treated?” 
Hellstrom asked, peering at it. 

“It is minor,” Saldo said. “No 
worse than a small burn.” 

“Take care of it as soon as you 
return.” 



Saldo heard concern for him in 
Hellstrom’s voice, was warmed 
by it. 

“1 heard Old Harvey choose you 
as his second in command,” Hell- 
strom continued. 

“1 was his choice.” Saldo spoke 
with calm confidence. 

“Have any of the others dis- 
played evidence of resenting you?” 
“Nothing serious.” 

H ellstrom liked that 

answer. It said Saldo was 
aware of incipient challenges, but 
felt able to deal with them. He no 
doubt could deal with them, too. 
Saldo carried himself well. He 
possessed a sure sense of rightness 
— about him hung an unspoken 
air of dominance. It must be tem- 
pered, though. 

“Did you enjoy being chosen 
by Old Harvey?” Hellstrom kept 
his voice flat. 

Saldo swallowed. Had he done 
something wrong? The question 
had held a prying coldness. But 
Hellstrom was smiling faintly 
beneath his nightmask. 

“I enjoyed it,” Saldo admitted, 
a faint uncertainty in his tone. 

Hellstrom heard the self- 
questioning quality in the younger 
man’s voice, nodded. Uncertainty 
bred caution. One could go from 
liking authority into a gambler’s 
stance, become overconfident. 
Hellstrom mentioned this in a 
quiet voice that carried only be- 
tween them. When he had finished 
Hellstrom said, “Tell me all you 
have ordered to be done here.” 
Saldo took up his account from 
where he had left off. He spoke 
with noticeable hesitations, quest- 



PROJECT40 



71 



ing in his own mind for possible 
errors, for needed corrections. 

Hellstrom interrupted to ask, 
“Who was first to see the Outsider 
female?” 

“Harvey,” Saldo said, recalling 
the motion <of the old man’s hand, 
the upthrust pointing finger to 
denote his discovery. A trickle of 
perspiration ran down Saldo’s 
cheek. He wiped at it irritatedly 
and the action burned his wound. 
“What orders did he give then?” 
“He had told us earlier that we 
were to circle her when we found 
her. We carried out that procedure 
with further orders.” 

“What did Harvey do next?” 
“He had no chance to do any- 
thing. The female turned on her 
light and began shooting.” 
Hellstrom looked down at the 
ground between them, glanced 
around. Several nearby workers 
had left their tasks out of curiosity 
and had moved closer to listen. 
“Why aren’t you workers doing 
as your leader ordered?” Hellstrom 
demanded. “Your leader gave you 
specific instructions. Carry them 
out.” He turned back to Saldo. 

“They are tired,” Saldo said, 
defending his people. “I will make 
a personal inspection of their work 
before leaving.” 

This one is a jewel, Hellstrom 
thought. He takes personal re- 
sponsibility without hesitation. 

“Exactly where were you when 
she began shooting?” 

“I was at the other end of the 
sweep from Harvey. When we 
closed the loop I found myself be- 
side him.” 

“Who knocked her out of the 
tree?” 



“The workers across from us 
where her light did not reach. The 
rest of us were dodging.” 

“And Harvey have no more com- 
mands?” 

“I believe he was the first one hit. 
I heard her first shot and — ” He 
hesitated, shrugged. “1 froze for an 
instant. Then 1 was hit and we were 
all rushing about. I saw Harvey go 
down and started toward him. 
There were more shots and sud- 
denly it was all over. She fell out of 
the tree.” 

“Your confusion is under- 
standable because you were 
wounded,” Hellstrom said. “I no- 
tice, however, that you kept your 
sense of balance sufficiently to 
prevent the killing of the captive. 
You lived up to my expectations. 
But always remember what hap- 
pened here. You have had a good 
lesson. The hunting of an Outsider 
is never the same as the hunting of 
any other animal. Do you under- 
stand that now?” 

S ALDO knew he had been both 
praised and censured. His at- 
tention went to the tree in which the 
female had concealed herself, 
returned reluctantly to Hellstrom. 

Hellstrom said, “You caught the 
female alive and that’s the im- 
portant thing.” He pursed his lips. 
“She carried a weapon and Harvey 
should have anticipated that. He 
should have brought her down the 
instant he saw her. He was within 
range. Do you know how to use 
Outsider weapons, Saldo?” 

“Yes. Harvey himself trained 
me.” 

“Learn to use them well. The 
Hive could have need of such 



72 



GALAXY 



abilities. Let’s see, you’re thirty- 
two years old, isn’t that correct?” 

“Yes.” 

“You still could pass for a youth 
among Outsiders. It may be that we 
will send you to one of their schools 
before long. We have ways of doing 
such things. You know about this.” 

“1 have not spent much time Out- 
side,” Saldo said. 

“I know. What experiences have 
you had?” 

“I spent a week in the town 
once- but not alone.” 

“Work or training?” 

“Training for myself and others 
with me.” 

“Would you like to go outside 
alone?” 

“I don’t think I’m ready for it.” 

Hellstrom nodded, pleased with 
the candor of the answer. Saldo 
would make a superb security spe- 
cialist. He already was far and 
away the most intuitively accurate 
among the New Breed. Give him a 
bit more experience and there 
would be none to compare with 
him. He possessed that beautiful 
Hive feeling for truth. He wouldn’t 
lie, not even about himself. He was 
a leader to be preserved and nur- 
tured. Hive conventions demanded 
this and the present circumstances 
required that Hellstrom begin that 
nurturing. 

“You are doing very well here,” 
Hellstrom said, speaking loudly 
enough for others to hear. “When 
the present crisis is over, we’ll make 
arrangements to send you Outside 
for further education. For now, re- 
port to me when you’ve finished out 
here.” He turned slowly strolled 
back toward the Hive, pausing oc- 
casionally to glance around. His 



every movement said he was satis- 
fied to leave matters to Saldo. 

For a moment Saldo watched 
Hellstrom go. The Hive’s First 
Councilor, leader in every crisis, the 
Prime Male— the one to whom all 
others turned when in doubt, even 
those who guided breeding and food 
production and tool fabrication — 
the chief worker among them all 
had come out on a fact-finding ex- 
pedition and had approved what he 
found. Saldo returned to overseeing 
the cleanup with a new sense of a 
elation that was strongly tempered 
by a deeper respect for his own 
limitations.

Minutes of the Hive Council: 
Interview with Philosopher- 
Specialist Harl (translated 
from Hivesign) — Once again. 
Philosopher Harl, we must 
disappoint you by telling you 
we have not come to take you 
to the blessed vats. Your great 
age, greater than that of any 
other worker in the Hive, and 
the artificial means we must 
use to keep life burning within 
you and all of the other reasons 
your wisdom uses in its argu- 
ments that we give you the re- 
lease of the vats — all these are 
difficult to refute. We respect- 
fully request that you cease 
these arguments and recall the 
Hive’s great need for your 
wisdom. We come again to ask 
your advice on how the Hive 
should employ the results of a 
successful Project 40. We can 
anticipate your first question 
and must answer it by saying 



PROJECT 40 



73 



that Project 40 is not yet 
fruitful. The worker specialists 
charged with the project say, 
however, that they can assure 
us of success. They say it is 
only a matter of time. 

Thus the words of Philoso- 
pher-Specialist Harl: Posses- 
sion of an ultimate weapon, of 
an ultimate threat to all of the 
life that shares this planet, 
brings with it no guarantee of 
supremacy. The very act of 
threatening to use such a 
weapon unless certain condi- 
tions prevail puts control of 
such a weapon into the hands 
of all those who control the 
conditions. You face the 
problem of what to do when 
these others say to you. “So use 
your weapon!” In this manner 
many will have the weapon. 
Even more to the point — 
anyone able to threaten the 
possessor of such a weapon 
also posesses it. Thus an ulti- 
mate weapon is useless unless 
those who controj it can temper 
the weapon’s violence. The 
weapon must have degrees of 
application which are less than 
ultimate. Take your lesson 
from the defense mechanisms 
everywhere visible in the insects 
who provide us with our pat- 
tern for survival. The spikes 
and prickles, the stingers and 
thorns, the burning chemicals 
and poisoned spears that jut 
angrily into the air, all these 
are defense mechanisms. They 
say. Don't threaten me. 

T YMIENA became aware quite 
slowly that her hands were 



bound behind her and that she was 
fastened securely into a chair of 
some kind. The chair’s surface was 
hard and she could feel the cold 
smoothness of its back against her 
arms. The most central part of her 
awareness focused on her ankle, 
which throbbed painfully where she 
had sprained it. Fighting a deep re- 
luctance, she opened her eyes, but 
found only an impenetrable dark- 
ness, thick and ominous. For a 
moment she feared she might be 
blind, but a faint glow insinuated it- 
self into her awareness. The glow 
existed at an indeterminate distance 
directly in front of her. It moved. 
“Ahhh, you’re awake, I see.” 

The voice was deep, masculine 
and came from somewhere above 
the moving glow. Something about 
its echoing quality told her she was 
in a room — quite a large room. 

She put down her terror with dif- 
ficulty, forced a false nonchalance 
into her voice. “How can you see? 
It’s pitch dark.” 

Hellstrom, seated in a corner of 
the laboratory where he could 
watch the glowing instruments that 
told him the female’s reactions, ad- 
mired her courage. 

“I can see,” he said. 

“My ankle hurts like hell.” 

“I truly regret that. We will give 
you something for that presently. 
Try to be patient.” 

She found an oddly reassuring 
sincerity in the voice. It ranged 
from low to tenor and sounded 
under exquisite control. 

“I hope I won’t have to stand this 
for very long,” she said. 

She must be brought into some 
semblance of calmness, Hellstrom 
told himself. The nightmask was ir-

ritating where it pressed against his 
nose and forehead. He did not like 
the way it limned the female in a sil- 
very glow. His annoyance came 
from fatigue, he knew. Sometimes 
the Hive demanded too much of 
him. But this Outsider female must 
be questioned and he found himself 
reluctant to turn her over to the 
merciless youngsters who always 
waited eagerly for an opportunity 
to prove themselves. He told him- 
self that he delayed with this female 
because he did not trust what the 
others had wrenched from De- 
peaux. How could the Outsiders 
know about Project 40? One of the 
interrogators must have mentioned 
it. That had to be the answer of 
course. It could be tested with this 
female. 

“First I must ask you a few ques- 
tions,” he said. 

“Why are you keeping it so 
dark?” she asked. 

“So you cannot see me.” 

A sudden elation filled her. The 
fact that her questioner didn’t want 
her to see him meant she would 
have an opportunity later to de- 
scribe him. This in-turn could only 
mean he meant to release her. 

H ELLSTROM read her reac- 
tion on his instruments. He 
said, “You were hysterical out 
there earlier. Did you think we were 
going to harm you?” 

What does he mean by that 
question? she wondered. They had 
her tied up like a Christmas turkey. 

“I was terrified,” she said. 
“Did — did I hurt anyone?” 

“You killed five of our people 
and injured two others.” 

She had not expected such a 



coldly candid answer and it shocked 
her. Five dead? Could they actually 
release her after that? 

“1 — 1 felt trapped,” she said. 
“My — my husband was not back 
and I was alone. I was terribly 
afraid. What have you done to 
Carlos?” 

“He is suffering no pain,” Hell- 
strom said. And that was true, he 
told himself. It was difficult to lie 
outright, even to a wild Outsider. 
His statement was true. Depeaux 
had been blissfully unconscious 
when his torn body had been slip- 
ped into the choppers and thence to 
the dissolving fluids of the vats. He 
had suffered no pain there and 
surely death had overcome him be- 
fore any glimmering return to con- 
sciousness. The choppers were 
quick. 

“Why do you have me tied this 
way?” she asked. 

“To keep you in one place while 1 
ask my questions. Tell me your 
name.” 

They would have her cover-iden- 
tification papers, she thought. “My 
name’s Tymiena — Tymiena De- 
peaux.” 

“Tell me about this government 
agency for which you work.” 

Her heart skipped a beat, but she 
managed a semblance of masked 
response: “Gov — 1 don’t work for 
any government agency! We were 
on vacation. My husband sells fire- 
works.” 

Hellstrom smiled sadly at what 
his instruments revealed. It was 
true, then — both of them worked 
for a government agency and that 
agency was curious. Although he 
had been opaque to most of their 
probings. Porter had revealed as 



PROJECT 40 



75 



much. But Porter had not said 
anything about Project 40. Would 
this female impart such informa- 
tion? He felt a quickening of his 
pulse. This was the kind of danger 
the Hive had always feared, but 
something in It aroused his hunt 
juices. 

“Is your agency the CIA?” Hell- 
Strom asked. 

“I’m just a housewife!” she 
protested. “Where’s Carlos? 
What’ve you done with my hus- 
band?” 

Hellstrom sighed. It was not the 
CIA, then — provided her responses 
could be trusted and provided she 
even knew the connections behind 
her employment. It was possible 
she did not know. Such agencies 
had a proclivity for putting covers 
on covers on covers. “Do not worry 
about your husband,” he said. 
“You will be with him soon. We 
know, however, that you are not a 
simple housewife. Simple house- 
wives do not carry such weapons as 
you had in your possession. They 
certainly do not demonstrate the 
proficiency you displayed with a 
weapon.” 

“1 don’t believe I killed anyone,” 
she said. 

“But you did.” 

“Carlos insisted I have that gun. 
He taught me how to shoot it.” 

Another lie, Hellstrom observed 
from his instruments. He felt 
cheated. Why was she continuing to 
hide? Surely she must know by now 
that she had been exposed by her 
accomplice. His questions could 
not conceal this. Hellstrom had 
forced himself to read the Depeaux 
interrogation account, avoiding 
nothing. What the merciless 



youngsters did they did in the name 
of the Hive. He wondered if he 
dared put her through a chemical 
reduction of personality. The 
youngsters argued against it. The 
method was painless, but uncertain. 
It had reduced Porter to slavering 
imbecility. The process tended to 
erase memories as it exposed them. 
He did not want the Porter effort 
repeated and decided not to listen 
to his own inner revulsions. What 
must be, must be. He would con- 
tinue with present methods, 
however, for as long as she did not 
suspect her emotions were being 
monitored and as long as informa- 
tion was being gathered. The tapes 
were spinning to record everything 
that occurred here. They could be 
subjected to a full analysis later. 
Even the Hive’s central computer 
might be helpful in the analysis, al- 
though Hellstrom tended to distrust 
computers. They had no emotions. 
Having no emotions, they failed 
when confronted by human prob- 
lems. 

“Why do you lie?” he asked. 

“I’m not lying!” 

“Is the agency that employs you 
an arm of the U.S. State De- 
partment?” 

“If you won’t believe me, there’s 
no sense in my answering. I just 
don’t understand what’s going on 
here. You chase me, knock me out, 
tie me up and all for — ” 

“And you killed five of my 
friends,” he reminded her. “Why?” 

“I don’t believe you. You’d better 
let me go. Carlos is a very im- 
portant man in his company. There 
are people who’ll come looking for 
us if 1 don’t call them.” 

“If you don’t report in?” Hell- 



76 



GALAXY 



Strom studied his instruments. She 
had been telling the truth there. 

“It’s not like that!” 

So she was supposed to report in, 
probably at regular intervals, Hell- 
strom thought. The eager 
youngsters had not elicited that 
from Depeaux. But then, they 
hadn't asked. 

“Why were you sent here?” 

“I wasn’t sent — ” 

“Then what were you doing 
here?” 

S HE seized this opportunity to 
elaborate on her cover story: the 
long hours Carlos usually worked, 
the rare vacations, his interest in 
birds, her own interest in landscape 
painting. There was a certain deli- 
cate practicality about her account, 
a sense of domesticity she found 
herself almost wishing were true. 
\ Carlos hadn’t been such a bad sort 
in spite of. She broke off her ac- 
count as this thought intruded. It 
confused her. There was internal 
significance in such a thought. Why 
would she think about Carlos in the 
' past tense? Carlos was dead! She 
felt certain of this. What had that 
character over there in the dark 
said to give her this feeling of 
certainty? She trusted her instincts 
and felt fear rising like a tide of 
bile. 

: Hellstrom saw the emotion on his 

instruments, tried to divert her. 
“Are you hungry?” he asked. 

'■ She found it difficult to speak at 
first, then responded in spite of a 
: dry mouth. “No, but my ankle 

I hurts terribly.” 

“We’ll take care of that pretty 
soon,” he reassured her. “Tell me, 
Mrs. Depeaux, if you were 



frightened, why did you not drive 
down to Fosterville in your 
camper?” 

That's what I should have done! 
she told herself. But she suspected 
this character and his friends had 
been prepared for such an attempt 
and that wouldn’t have succeeded 
either. 

She said, “I must have done 
something wrong. It wouldn’t 
start.” 

“That’s odd,” he said. “It started 
immediately for us.” 

So they had the camper, too. All 
evidence of Depeaux and Grinelli 
would be gone by now. Carlos and 
Tymiena, both dead. A tear 
trickled down her left cheek. 
“Are you a communist agent?” 
In spite of himself Hellstrom 
chuckled. Then: “What an odd 
question from a simple housewife!” 
His amusement filled her with 
bracing anger. “You’re the one who 
keeps talking about agents and the 
State Department,” she flared. 
“What’s going on here?” 

“You are not what you appear to 
be, Mrs. Depeaux,” Hellstrom 
said. “There is even some doubt in 
mind as to whether you actually are 
Mrs. Depeaux.” (Ah, that hit a 
nerve, he noted. So they were just 
working together and not married.) 
“1 suspect you did — do not even 
care much for Carlos.” 

Did not care, she thought. That's 
what he was going to say. He 
caught himself. The lie came out. 

She began to think back over this 
unseen man’s every reference to 
Carlos. The dead felt no pain. 
There was a sense of over-and-done 
with about every mention of 
Carlos. She revised her assessment 



PROJECT 40 



77 



of her own situation. Darkness 
could have another significance 
than hiding the identity of her inter- 
rogator. It could be a deliberate 
ploy to confuse her, lower her de- 
fenses. She began to explore her 
bindings, str<aining against them. 
They were damnably tight. 

“You do not answer me,” Hell- 
strom said. 

“Why should I? 1 think you’re 
awful.” 

“Is your agency an arm of the 
government’s executive branch?” 

“No.” 

He read otherwise in her res- 
ponses, but it was a tempered 
reading. The answer probably was 
that she believed this to be the case 
but harbored her own doubts. He 
noted she was twisting frantically, 
trying to escape her bounds now. 
Didn’t she believe he could see her? 

“Why does the government inves- 
tigate us?” he asked. 

She refused to answer. The bin- 
dings were deceptive. They felt like 
leather and appeared to give when 
she strained against them, but when 
she stopped struggling even for an 
instant they felt as tighf as ever. 

“You work for an agency asso- 
ciated with the executive arm of 
government,” he said. “It is a mat- 
ter of curiosity that such an agency 
should pry into our affairs. What 
interest could the government have 
in us?” 

“You’re going to kill me, aren’t 
you?” she asked. 

She gave up struggling, felt com- 
pletely exhausted. Her mind 
teetered on the edge of hysteria. 
They were going to kill her. They 
had killed Carlos and were going to 
kill her. Something had gone very 



sour. It was the very thing she’d 
sensed in this assignment from the 
first. That damned fool, Merrivale! 
He never got anything right. And 
Carlos — the dope of dopes. Carlos 
had probably walked right into a 
trap. They had caught him and he 
had spilled his guts. That was ob- 
vious. This questioner knew too 
many things already. Carlos had 
babbled and they had killed him. 

H ELLSTROM’S instruments 
revealed her approach to 
hysteria. The fear disturbed him. 
Efe knew his reaction came partly 
from his own sensitivity to her 
subtle bodily excretions. She was 
broadcasting terror for anyone 
Hive-trained to receive. No worker 
could have escaped an awareness. 
He didn’t even need his instru- 
ments. This room would have to be 
flushed out later. They had had to 
do the same thing after interro- 
gating Depeaux. Any workers who 
encountered such emission would 
be disturbed. He still had his duty 
to the Hive, though. Perhaps in her 
fear she would reveal what he most 
wanted to know. 

“You work for the government,” 
he said. “We know this. You were 
sent here to pry into our affairs — 
what did you expect to find?” 

“1 wasn’t!” she screamed. “1 
wasn’t! I wasn’t! I wasn’t! Carlos 
just told me we were going on vaca- 
tion. What have you done with 
Carlos?” 

“You’re lying,” he said. “1 know 
you are lying and you certainly 
must realize by now that your lies 
are not working with me. It will go 
better with you if you tell me the 
truth.” 



78 



GALAXY 



“You’re going to kill me any- 
way” she whispered. 

Damn! Hellstrom thought. 

His brood mother had warned 
him that this crisis-within-a-crisis 
might come in his lifetime. His 
workers had tortured a wild human. 
It had been done far outside the 
concept of mercy — the idea had not 
even entered the workers’ 
awareness as they had gone about 
their business of extracting infor- 
mation necessary for the Hive’s 
survival. But such actions left their 
mark upon the entire Hive. There 
were no more innocents anywhere 
within the Hive. We've moved a 
step closer to the insects we mimic, 
he thought. And he wondered why 
the thought saddened him. He sus- 
pected that any life form that in- 
flicted unnecessary pain tended to 
Find its consciousness eroding. 
Without consciousness to reflect 
back upon life, all life might lose its 
sense of purpose. 

In sudden anger he snarled, “Tell 
me about Project Forty!” 

She gasped. Then they knew 
everything. What had they done to 
Carlos to make him tell everything? 
She felt icy with terror. 

“Tell me,” he barked. 

“I — I don’t know what you’re 
talking about.” 

The instruments told him what he 
needed to know. “It will go very 
badly with you if you do not tell 
me,” he said. “I wish to spare you 
that. Tell me about Project Forty.” 
“But I don’t know anything — ” 
The instruments accorded this 
the value of an almost-truth. “You 
know some things about it,” he 
said. “Tell me what you do know.” 
“Why don’t you just kill me?” 



Hellstrom found himself working 
through a haze of deep sadness, al- 
most despair. Powerful wild hu- 
mans Outside knew about Project 
40! How could that be? What did 
they know? This female was little 
more than a pawn in a larger game, 
but she might yet provide a 
valuable clue. 

“You must tell me what you 
know,” he said. “If you do 1 pro- 
mise to treat you gently.” 

“I don’t trust you,” she said. 

“You have no one else to trust.” 

“They’ll come looking for me!” 

“But they will not find you. Now, 
tell me what you know about 
Project Forty.” 

“It’s just a name,” she said, 
wilting. What was the use? They 
knew everything else. 

“Where did you encounter this 
name?” 

“There were papers. They were 
left on a table at MIT and one of 
our people copied them.” 

Stunned, Hellstrom closed his 
eyes. “What was in those papers?” 

“Some figures and formulas and 
things which didn’t make much 
sense. But someone suggested they 
could be part of the design for a 
weapon.” 

“Did he say what kind of 
weapon?” 

“1 think they said a ‘particle 
pump’ or something like that. They 
said such a weapon could resonate 
matter at a distance, break glass 
and that sort of thing.” She signed 
deeply, wondered why she was 
talking. They were going to kill her 
anyway. What did anything matter? 

“Are — your people attempting to 
make such a weapon from these pa- 
pers?” 



PROJECT 40 



79 



“They’re trying, but 1 heard that 
the papers they found were incom- 
plete. They’re not sure about a lot 
of things and there’s an argument 
over whether it’s really a weapon.’’ 
“They do not agree that it’s a 
weapon?” 

“I don’t think so.” Again she 
sighed. “Is it a weapon?” 

“It is a weapon,” he said. 

“Are you going to kill me now?” 
she asked. 

T ’HE plaintive, pleading note in 
her voice sent rage erupting in 
him. The fools! The utter fools! He 
groped for his stunwand which he 
had dropped to the floor beside the 
instruments, found it and brought it 
up, setting for full charge. Those 
wild idiots Outside had to be stop- 
ped. He thrust the wand toward her 
as though he wanted to penetrate 
her flesh with it, let her have the full 
charge. The force of it resonating in 
the insulated confines of the labora- 
tory stunned him for an instant and 
when he had recovered he saw that 
all of the needles on his instruments 
had dropped to zero. He turned on 
the lab’s lights, rose to his feet 
slowly and crossed to the female 
form sagging in the chair. She lay 
slumped to her right, held by the 
bindings. She was utterly still. He 
knew she was dead before he bent 
and confirmed it. She had taken a 
charge strong enough to kill a steer. 
There would be no more ques- 
tioning of Tymiena, whatever her 
name was. 

Why did I do that? he wondered. 
Had it been the memory of De- 
peaux’s shattered flesh going into 
the vats? Was it some higher de- 
mand from his Hive awareness? Or 



had it been a peculiar personal 
quirk? He had acted in reflex, not 
thinking. It was done — no calling it 
back. But his own behavior trou- 
bled him. 

Still in the grip of anger, he 
strode from the lab. When the eager 
youngsters in the outer room 
crowded around him he waved 
them aside, told them the captive 
female was dead. He answered their 
protests with curt gestures, saying 
only that he had learned what he 
needed to learn. When one of the 
youngsters asked if they should 
take the carcass to the vats or try 
for a sexual stump he paused for 
only the briefest reflection before 
agreeing that they should try for a 
stump. Perhaps some of that female 
flesh could be revived and 
preserved. If her womb could be 
maintained she might yet serve the 
Hive. It would be interesting to see 
a child of that flesh. 

Other problems dominated his 
awareness, however. He stalked 
from the lab area, still angry with 
himself. Outsiders knew about 
Project 40! A Hive worker had 
been destructively careless. How 
had such papers been allowed out of 
the Hive? Who had done this? 
How? Papers at MIT? Who had 
done the research there? The Hive 
must learn the extent of this dis- 
aster and take quick action to 
ensure that nothing of this sort ever 
happened again. 

He hoped the breeder labs suc- 
ceeded in making a sexual stump of 
Tymiena. She had served the Hive 
already and she deserved to have 
her genes preserved.

14 April 2147. Today I resolved 
to begin keeping a diary. Un- 
fortunately nothing of real interest 
happened. 

15 April. Nothing happened again 
today. Just registration. 

16 April. I can’t go on wasting 
paper or Earth’s Conservation 
Board will take my diary away 
and process it into something 
useful, like toilet paper. So even 
though nothing happened again, 
I’ll fill up this space with biograph- 
ical detail that will no doubt be of 
great value to future historians. 

1 was born Jonathan Wu, on 17 
January 2131, to Martha and 
Jonathan Wu II, out of the sur- 
rogate host-mother Sally 217- 
44-7624. My parents were wealthy 
enough to be permitted two legal 
children, but my early behavior 
convinced them that one was 
sufficient. As soon as I was old 
enough to travel, barely four, 
they packed me off to Clavius 
Tutorial Creche, figuring that a 
quarter of a million miles was a 
safe distance from which to moni- 
tor my growth. 

Clavius Creche, it says here, 
was established as a uniquely 
isolated and controlled environ- 
ment for the cultivation of little 
scholars. And medium-sized schol- 
ars. But when you get to be big 
gangling scholar, you’ve got to go 
somewhere else. There are no uni- 
versities on the moon, only techni- 



82 



cal schools. You can take up Lunar 
citizenship — as long as you’re 
mutandis — and be admitted to one 
of those technical schools, winding 
► up as some kind of supercerebral 
mechanic. But 1 suppose my father 
was willing to live on the same 
planet with me rather than allow 
me to grow into being something 
other than a gentleman. 

I got back to Earth one week 
ago today. 

17 April. We began course work 
today. This quarter I’m taking 
supposedly parallel courses in 
algorithmic analysis and logical 
systems. If I ever get “introduced” 
to Boolean algebra again I’ll curl 
into a ball and swallow my tongue. 
Continuing readings and analysis 
in classical Greek and Latin. 
Supposed to do preliminary read- 
ings for next quarter: XXth Cen- 
tury English and American Poets 
and Commercial Literature as a 
Cultural Index. This will be with 
Applied Stochastic Analysis and 
Artificial Intelligence I. The 
poetry is amusing but the “com- 
mercial” novels make tedious 
reading. One has always to keep in 
mind that none of these authors 
was born with the benefit of genetic 
engineering and they were at 
best men of unremarkable intel- 
ligence in a world populated with 
morons and worse. 

Earth gravity tires me. 

18 April. I was talking with my 
TWENTY-SIX DAYS ON EARTH 



advisor (Greek and Latin) Dr. 
Friedman and complained about 
the sterility of this upcoming 
literature course. He introduced me 
to the work of an Irish author 
named Joyce, lending me a copy of 
the construct Finnegans Wake. It 
has taken me ten hours to read the 
first thirty pages — totally im- 
mersed in it through lunch and din- 
ner. Fascinating. Easily equal to the 
best of Thruman — why weren’t 
we given Joyce at Creche? 

I am required to walk for at 
least two hours every day in order 
to become accustomed to the 
gravity. Thus 1 am writing this 
standing up, the diary propped on 
a bookshelf. Also must eat hand- 
fuls of nauseating calcium tablets 
and will have to walk with braces 
until my leg bones have hardened. 
Had I stayed on the moon another 
five years I probably never would 
have been able to return to Earth 
(a prospect which at present would 
not bother me a bit). 

The braces chafe and look ridic- 
ulous in this foppish Earth cloth- 
ing. But I get a certain notoriety 
out of being such an obvious 
extraterrestrial. 

My father called this morning 
and we talked about my courses 
for a few minutes. 

19 April. Today was the first day I 
ventured outside the campus com- 
plex on foot. It gave me an un- 
comfortable feeling to be outside 
without suiting up. Of course, one 

83 



does wear a respirator (even inside 
some of the buildings, which leak), 
and that does something to allay 
the agoraphobia. 

How will I react to the geo- 
physics course next year? The 
students take field trips to wild 
preserves where they work for 
extended periods simply under the 
sky, exposed to the elements. I 
realize that mine is an irrational 
fear, that men lived for millions 
of years breathing natural air, 
walking around in the open with- 
out the slightest thought that there 
should be something around them. 
Perhaps 1 can convince them that 
since on Luna this fear is not ir- 
rational, but part of survival — 
perhaps they will grant me some 
sort of dispensation — waive the 
course, or at least allow me to 
wear a suit. 

While wandering around outside 
the campus I dropped into a tavern 
that supposedly caters to students. 
I had some ordinary wine and a 
bit of hashish which wasn’t at all 
like the Lunar product. It only 
served to make me tired. The 
tavernkeeper didn't believe that 1 
was sixteen until I produced my 
passport. 

I got into a rather long and 
pointless conversation with an 
Earthie mutandis over the neces- 
sity for interplanetary tariff im- 
balance. They know so little about 
the other worlds. But then I know 
little enough about Earth — for 
one who was born here. 



1 was barely able to get back to 
the dormitory without assistance 
and slept through half of my 
normal reading period. Had to 
take stimulants to finish the last 
book of the Georgies. So much of 
it is about open-air farming that it 
kept bringing back my earlier 
discomfort. 

Resolved not to smoke any more 
Earth hashish until I get my 
strength back. 

20 April. Algorithmic analysis has 
an economy and order that appeals 
to me. ! had, of course, planned to 
take my doctorate in Letters, but 
now 1 want to investigate mathe- 
matics further. My father would 
have apoplexy. A gentleman hires 
mathematicians. 1 made an ap- 
pointment with the advising 
facility for tomorrow. 

1 am having difficulty making 
friends. Customs here are rather 
strange, but I have grown up in 
knowledge of that and am pre- 
pared to make any adjustment. 
Perhaps I am too critical of Earth 
society. 

An embarrassing illustration: 
this morning for the first time I 
felt strong enough for sex. Thinking 
this would be an ideal way to begin 
more cordial relations with Earth- 
ies, I made a tactful suggestion of 
that nature to one of my class- 
mates in Systems. She was quite 
indignant and wound up giving 
me a lecture on cultural relativism. 
The kernel of it, at least as applied

to this situation, was that one is 
supposed to go through an elabo- 
rate series of courting gestures 
with a prospective mate. Like a 
bird ruffing out his feathers and 
cooing. I told her this might make 
some sense if the ritual had some- 
thing to do with predicting or pro- 
moting future sexual compatibility 
between the two people, which it 
didn’t. She reacted with almost 
frightening force. 

My father had warned me about 
this moral oddity, but I was given 
to understand that it applied only 
to the tower classes and, speci- 
fically, to the remaining homo 
sapiens. Certainly there is a good 
argument for reducing the number 
of unengineered births by repress- 
ing casual sexual contact, but the 
same restrictive behavioral pat- 
terns shouldn’t be impressed on 
homo mutandis, to which group I 
assumed my classmate belonged. 
From the speciousness of her argu- 
ment, 1 suppose it’s possible it’s 
possible she doesn’t, but then how 
could she get into a university? Of 
course, I wouldn’t insult her by 
asking. 

21 April. The machine analyzed 
my profile and said that 1 had the 
potential for moderate success in 
mathematics, but that I was tem- 
peramentally better suited for 
literature. It advised that I continue 
a double course of study for as long 
as possible and then switch all my 
energies to one field or the other as

TWENTY-SIX DAYS ON EARTH

soon as it became clear in which 
direction my greatest interest lay. 
An agreeable course of action, 
perhaps because of my natural 
indecisiveness. 

1 have found a friend after all. 
He isn't an Earthie, but a Martian, 
also come to Earth for “polish.” 
His name is Chatham Howard 
and he was flattered that I recog- 
nized the Howard name both for 
its role in early Martian history 
and for the social rank it now 
represents on Mars. He is a year 
ahead of me, studying sociology. 

22 AprU. Chatham took me to a 
party and introduced me to a num- 
ber of very pleasant Earthies. I’m 
still sorting out the impressions, 
changing my ideas a little bit. Not 
all Earthies my age are immature 
provincials. 

Met an interesting female by 
the name of Pamela Anderson. I 
have begun the courting ritual to 
the best of my abilities. 1 was at- 
tentive and complimentary (though 
she had some strange ideas, she is 
not unintelligent) and agreed to 
meet her tomorrow for the evening 
meal. 

We kissed once. Odd custom. 

23 April. Chatham and a friend 
joined Pamela and me for dinner 
at Luigi's, a restaurant that 
specializes in an old-fashioned 
cuisine called “North-American- 
Italian.” It is more spicy than 1 
am accustomed to, but Pamela 



recommended a fairly bland dish 
called spaghetti with mushroom 
sauce. It was rather good and 
reminiscent of some familiar 
fungi dishes. 

After dinner we went to a public 
theater and saw a drama tape that 
consisted mainly of views of 
various couples copulating. It was 
much the same as the tapes I’d 
been watching in mental hygiene 
classes since I was eight years old, 
but in this bizarre setting I found it 
strangely exciting. 

We had drinks at the theater 
after the show and engaged in 
some bright banter. It was all quite 
enjoyable, but I got the impres- 
sion that Pamela was not yet in- 
terested in me sexually. This was a 
disappointment, especially after 
Chatham’s friend quite directly 
asked him to spend the night with 
her. Pamela was warm but ex- 
tended no such invitation. 

For the first time I wondered 
whether she might not consider 
me too “alien” for a sex partner. 
I am a half-meter taller than she 
and my Lunar myaesthenia is all 
too evident, with the braces and 
my quickness to fatigue. I’m also a 
couple of years younger than she, 
which evidently is rather important 
on Earth. 

I found out in our conversation 
that many of the customs relating 
to this mating ritual are centuries 
old. This is an exasperating thing 
about Earth — in many ways they 
cling stubbornly to the cultural 



86 



GALAXY 



matrix that brought them to with- 
in a buttoin-push of destroying 
humanity. 'On the Worlds, at 
least we had the sense to junk it all 
and start over. 

Sometimes it brings me up 
short to remember that 1 was born 
an Earthie. 

24 April. Today I got lost in the 
middle of writing a long Turing 
Machine algorithm when my mind 
strayed to Pamela. I had to go back 
to the beginning and start over. 
Idiotic! Perhaps all this medication 
is affecting my mental discipline. 

Continuing with analysis of the 
writings of Virgil, or at least those 
attributed to him. Obvious many 
of them written by somebody else. 

25 April. Pamela met me, without 
prior arrangement, outside my 
Systems classroom — an encourag- 
ingly aggressive sign. But it turned 
out that her real interest was in 
learning more about Lunar mores 
for a paper in Comparative Soci- 
ology. We went down to the 
cafeteria and discussed, essentially, 
how different she was from me. 1 
left feeling depressed, but with a 
“date” for a concert tomorrow. 

26 April. The concert was on an 
ancient instrument called the 
“glass harmonica.” The melodies 
were interesting, but the rhythms 
were simplistic and the harmonies 
progressed in a predictable manner. 
Yet the overall effect was moving. 



I learned the most startling thing 
after the concert. Pamela is not 
mutandis. We went to a bhang 
shop with another couple and 
talked about the difference, the 
distance between sapiens and 
mutandis. She accused me of 
being ill-informed and patronizing 
when 1 talked about our obliga- 
tion to guide and protect sapiens 
as they inevitably died out over the 
next few generations. She said she 
was not engineered and her children 
were not going to be, nor their 
children. She said something we 
had not been taught on Luna, but 
once it was pointed out 1 had to 
admit her argument was obvious. 
She maintained that there was no 
guarantee that genetic engineer- 
ing was going to be successful in a 
long race and that humanity must 
maintain a large and pure com- 
munity of sapiens for several 
centuries in case the “experiment” 
fails. 

1 privately disagreed with her 
contention that sapiens must al- 
ways remain in the majority. 
Certainly a million or two would 
be adequate to the task of rebuild- 
ing the race, should all of us 
mutandi turn purple and explode. 
Of course her worry was political 
rather than biological. She was 
concerned that we might irration- 
ally legislate sapiens out of 
existence — were we in the majority. 

She said we had done exactly 
that on Luna and I had to explain 
patiently why we no longer al- 



TWENTY-SIX DAYS ON EARTH

lowed sapiens as colonists. It was 
not prejudice, but simple logic. She 
was not convinced. 

[Of course, this explains why I 
was so surprised to find that 
Pamela was not mutandis. All the 
sapiens on Luna are quite old and 
mentally incompetent because of 
a lack of correctional therapeutics 
in their youth. I was guilty of un- 
consciously projecting my attitudes 
toward their manifest inferiority 
onto Earthie sapiens.] 

Somehow the fact that she is not 
mutandis does not make her less 
attractive to me. My regard for her 
intellectual abilities should be 
greater, knowing as 1 do now that 
she started out with a genetic handi- 
cap. The main thing 1 feel now 
is a vague distrust of her emo- 
tional reliability. Or do 1 mean 
predictability? It is all very 
confusing. 

27 April. Algorithmic Analysis 
test tonight. Not difficult but 
studying for it was very time- 
consuming. 

28 April. Pamela took me to the 
zoo. A tiring but extremely re- 
warding day. Animals are fas- 
cinating. It occurred to me that 
being adult — or nearly so — and 
seeing non-human creatures for 
the first time in my life might give 
me some unique insight. Instead 
of writing a long entry in this diary 
tonight 1 will begin an essay on 
the experience. 



My feet are throbbing. Told 
Pamela the joke about the com- 
puter playing chess with itself 
and she laughed. Was this the first 
time I’ve seen her laugh? 

29 April. Pamela read my essay 
and left, saying she never wanted 
to see me again. She was crying. 

30 April. I have reconsidered some 
of the comparisons I made (in the 
essay) between sapiens and ani- 
mals. They were meant to be 
satirical, but 1 can see in the light 
of Pamela’s reaction that this 
intent was not clear. Rather than 
attempt to translate my efforts at 
humor into Earthie terms 1 deleted 
these passages. 1 sent a copy to 
Pamela. 

Reading back, 1 see I have known 
her little more than a week. Odd. 



1 May. Latin test. 

2 May. Pamela visited today, 
bringing a male companion. She 
did not mention the essay. 

I realized that 1 don’t know 
Pamela well enough to decide 
whether she brought the other 
man. Hill Beaumont, in order to 
provoke jealousy in me (con- 
sciously or otherwise). 1 under- 
stand jealousy, of course, from my 
reading, but 1 have never felt it 
and believe myself immune. 

Besides, Beaumont is a rather 
stupid fellow. 



88 



GALAXY 



3 May. Beaumont dropped in 
alone today, saying that he had 
read the essay and complimenting 
me at some length on it. He is 
still a dull oaf, but I can't help now 
feeling more kindly disposed to- 
ward him. He wanted to take me 
out and chatter over a bottle of 
wine, but I pleaded lack of time. 
Which was true -Greek test 
tomorrow evening and I have 
neglected it lately. Much reading 

! to do. 

I asked about Pamela. Beau- 
j mont said he hadn’t seen her since 
I they left me yesterday. 

f 

4 May. Greek. Stayed in my 

I room all day, studying, but ac- 
t cepted an invitation to eat with 
I Chatham and Beaumont after the 
I test. Quite a lot happened and 
I even though it’s after two in the 

r morning I think I’ll stay up and 




J memory. 

We met at Luigi’s for a light 
’ supper and wine. Chatham, of 
course, is always interesting, but 
the evening was almost spoiled 
for me when Beaumont revealed 
with a conversational flourish that 
y he, also, was mutandis. In fact, he 
is an elected officer in a local 
club, the membership of which is 
restricted to “us.” There was a 
j! meeting of the club that night and 
» Beaumont invited me to come and 
speak to them, mainly on the 
^ subject of the essay about animals. 
I He had his copy of the essay with 



him. Chatham said he had a pre- 
vious engagement, but urged me to 
go along, saying the meetings 
were always amusing. I didn’t see 
any way I could gracefully decline 
— figured it might even be fun as 
long as they weren’t all like Beau- 
mont. We left Chatham to finish 
off the wine — an office for which 
he had singular talent — and slid a 
couple of blocks to the meeting 
place. 

Some of Beaumont’s friends 
have the oddest ideas about what 
it means to be mutandis. The 
gathering was one of the strangest 
affairs I’ve experienced on Earth. 

First a man stood up and 
demonstrated a construct which 
was a poem, in Latin, written in 
the form of an eighty-by-eight 
matrix. He showed how you could 
perform semantic analogues of 
the normal reduction transforma- 
tions to get various intermediate 
poems — none of which made much 
sense — and arrive finally at a 
matrix that was null throughout 
except for sum-sum-sum-sum all 
down the main diagonal. A 
puerile exercise, bad poetry and 
naive mathematics, but everybody 
seemed dutifully impressed. 

Then a woman showed a 
“sculpture” she had made by syn- 
thesizing a large cube of piezo- 
electric crystal and fracturing it, in 
what she felt to be an artistic way, 
by applying various charges to 
different parts of the surface. 
That she could have arrived at a 



i TWENTY-SIX DAYS ON EARTH 



89 



similar end by merely dropping the 
thing on a hard floor did not dimin- 
ish audience appreciation. 

So it went for an hour and a 
half. My presentation was the last 
one and I’m sure nine-tenths of the 
applause I got was due to that 
fact, rather than to any intrinsic 
merit of the composition. 

The disturbing part of the even- 
ing, though, was a roundtable dis- 
cussion about sapiens and what 
eventually would have to be done 
about them. Some of the reason- 
ing was so fuzzy that it wouldn’t 
have done justice to a child in 
first-form Creche. 

One thing I learned — one very 
surprising thing — was that mu- 
tandi make up only about 1% of 
the Earth’s population. Why did 
they hide this fact from us in 
Creche? At any rate, the irrational 
nature of some of their proposals 
tonight might possibly be excused 
as simple “minority paranoia.’’ 

An idea that met with'a good deal 
of approval struck me as both 
sneaky and foolish. There is agita- 
tion from various groups concerned 
with population control to make 
the practice of host-mothership uni- 
versal and require that all people 
be sterilized soon after puberty, 
having filed a sample of sperm 
or ovum with the government. 
Thus the size of every family 
could be absolutely regulated by 
the government. 

It was pointed out that this 
would inevitably lead to universal 



manipulation of all of humanity’s 
genetic material — reasoning that 
mutandis being manifestly superior 
to the rest of humanity, it was 
only a question of time before they 
held all important governmental 
positions. Thus assured of free- 
dom from bureaurocratic inter- 
ference they would, of course, 
institute a program of universal 
genetic manipulation. For the 
benefit of all humanity. 

Somebody brought up Pamela’s 
argument that it will take many 
generations before we are sure 
genetic manipulation is totally 
safe. Most felt that it would be 
sufficiently proven by the time 
“we” have taken over. 

I told them that the weakness 
in the idea had nothing to do with 
manipulation — that the universal 
storage of genetic material was in 
itself a questionable idea. For the 
convenience of the government all 
of it would probably be stored near 
government centers which, like any 
large concentration of people, 
get power from one source: micro- 
waves beamed down from the 
orbital solar stations. The fact that 
these have functioned continuously 
for over a century doesn’t mean 
they are immune to breakdown. 
In fact, it’s quite likely that if 
they go, it will be because of some 
powerful solar event that would 
affect all of them simultaneously. 
No power, no refrigeration. The 
genetic material, at least most of 
it, would thaw out and die and 



90 



GALAXY 



humanity would have to depend on 
the current crop of children to 
reach sexual maturity and replen- 
ish the race. That crop might be 
small indeed if there were stringent 
controls on family size. There 
might not be enough breeders to 
bring the next generation up to a 
size sufficient to carry on civiliza- 
tion as we live it now. 

And a power failure might not 
even require a solar catastrophe. 
It’s possible that some people 
wouldn’t like the idea of our chang- 
ing all of humankind into mutandis 
and would sabotage the sperm and 
ovum banks without thinking or 
caring about the consequences. 

They listened politely to my 
counter-arguments, but I don’t 
think many of them were con- 
vinced. They take electrical power 
too much for granted here on 
Earth. They have lived with local 
failures, which meant little more 
than having to walk down still 
slidewalks for a few hours. 

There has of course been only 
one power failure on Luna. 



5 May. Knowing that Pamela has 
a course in Sociometrics, I con- 
trived to spend a few hours down at 
the social sciences computing 
facility, supposedly checking out 
an algorithm that simulated a 
Turing machine. Actually I knew 
that it worked, having run it 
successfully over at the mathe- 
matics facility, but I kept putting 



glitches in it in order to remain at 
the console. 

She did show up after four hours. 
Luckily she was only there to pick 
up a printout. It was dinner time, 
so I escorted her down to the 
Union. We each got a plate of small 
sandwiches and talked. 

I told her about my experience 
with Beaumont’s crowd. She was 
amused, which for some reason 
made me angry at first — ^just be- 
cause she was sapiens, I guess — 
but she jostled me about it so 
much that I wound up laughing, 
too. She admitted that this had 
been her purpose when she first 
introduced Beaumont to me — to 
demonstrate that not all mutandi 
were a priori superior examples of 
humanity. 

In the dining hall I said hello to 
one of the girls who had been at 
last night’s meeting, the one with 
the piezoelectric sculpture. She 
stared right through me and didn’t 
miss a bite. 

6 May. What a long and disturbing 
day. This morning 1 found this note 
in my box:

A HOMO SAPIENS ■ FRANKLY, 
WE ARE DISGUSTED ■ FROM

TINUE THIS OBSCENE RELA- 
TIONSHIP WITH PAMELA AN- 
DERSON, BOTH OF YOU WILL BE 
IN PROEOUND TROUBLE ■■ WE 
WILL BE IN TOUCH ■■■ STECOM 

I sought out Beaumont and, 
yes, he had heard of stecom, 
the Steering Committee for Hu- 
manity, but never to his knowledge 
had ever caused anyone “pro- 
found trouble.” It served mainly 
to protect the interests of mutandi 
in legislation, commerce and so on. 
He said that the organization’s 
public stance was much milder than 
that represented by my note, but 
that he knew many of the members 
to hold similar views privately. 

He gave me the number of the 
local STECOM chairman and ! 
contacted him. He denied any con- 
nection with the note, said that 
whoever signed it did so without au- 
thority, asked that 1 keep him ap- 
prised of further developments and 
told me not to worry. The note was 
the work of an extremist. Somehow 
that gave me very little comfort. 

I left word with Pamela’s room- 
mate, asking that Pamela call as 
soon as she returned from classes. 
She called and we arranged to meet 
for dinner. 



We sat at a back table in Luigi’s 
and she read the note. At first she 
was amused, then alarmed. She 
didn’t think they would dare do 
anything to her, but they might try 
to harass me. 

She said she thought it would be 
best if we didn’t see each other for a 
while. I protested that that would 
be a cowardly action in response to 
what was already the act of a 
coward, hiding behind anonymity. 
We argued. In the course of the 
argument she said I was wasting my 
efforts anyhow, as our relationship 
could never by anything other than 
casual and platonic. We finished 
our meal in silence and she asked 
me not to walk her home. 

On my way back to the dormi- 
tory, right after getting off the 
South Quadrant Westbound slide- 
walk, 1 had to pass a dense stand of 
shrubbery that threw a deep 
shadow over the walk. 1 probably 
wouldn’t have seen my assailants 
even had I not been lost in brooding 
thought. 

One slipped behind me and threw 
a fabric bag over my head and 
shoulders, then pinioned my arms 
behind me. The other hit me once in 
the solar plexus and twice on the 
face, then reached under the bag 
and tore off my respirator. They 
fled and I staggered and crawled to 
the nearest dormitory. The medic 
there gave me some oxygen and 
pasted up my one serious-looking 
wound, a nasty cut over my left eye. 
He gave me a voucher for the ma- 



92 



GALAXY 



terials he had used, so I could re- 
turn them from my dormitory’s 
supply, lent me a respirator and 
sent me on my way. A classmate 
walked over with me to help fore- 
stall a recurrence. 

As 1 write this my throat still 
hurts from breathing the sulfurous 
air. Good thing the attack didn’t 
happen downtown, nearer the In- 
dustrial Park. 

I’ll take an extra Pain-go and 
retire. 



7 May. I went to the campus police 
and they told me that an investi- 
gation would be a waste of time 
since there were no witnesses and I 
couldn’t identify my assailants. I 
recognized the chief as having been 
at the meeting the other night and 
didn’t press him. 

Another note in my box. This one 
simply read: ■ return to luna ■■ 
■ STECOM ■. I called up the 
Steering Committee chairman 
again and informed him of this new 
note and of last night’s assault. He 
became flustered but offered no 
worthwhile advice. 

Somebody had forced his way 
into my room and poured soya all 
over my books and papers. When 
they' were completely dry, I took 
them down to the laundry and used 
the ultrasonic dry-cleaner on them. 
It worked after a fashion. I hope 
whoever was responsible read this 
diary before dousing it and saw that 
Pamela is not enthusiastic about 



my “seeking a sexual liaison’’ with 
her. Now maybe all of this will 
stop. 

Work goes on, of course. Tree 
theory and yet more non-Virgil. 

I toyed with the idea of trying to 
trace the person or persons behind 
the notes. 

They were simple computer 
printouts, so the person would first 
have had to encode a crystal. The 
crystal would have to be re-filed 
and, if it hadn’t yet been erased for 
another use, it would be a simple 
matter to find out who had last 
checked it out. 

Simple in theory, at least. There 
must be five or six computing 
facilities on campus, each with 
several thousand crystals. 

And for that matter, it wouldn’t 
be difficult to have the message 
printed out and then code some- 
thing new over that domain of the 
crystal, as if the message had been a 
glitch. 

1 tried to think of how 1 might set 
a trap without using Pamela as 
bait. My mind just isn’t devious 
enough or perhaps it doesn’t have 
enough information. Since Cha- 
tham has more deviousness and in- 
formation at his disposal I tried to 
contact him. He was out, though. 
He had been gone since yesterday. I 
settled for Beaumont. 

We roughed out a plan over a 
bottle of wine in the lounge of his 
dormitory. He knew most of the 
mutandi on campus and knew 
which ones were the most extreme 



TWENTY-SIX DAYS ON EARTH 



93 



in their views. He would meet some 
of them socially and bring the con- 
versation around to Pamela and 
me. If the person showed any 
interest Beaumont would pretend to 
sympathize with the idea that 
mutandi should mate with their 
own kind — as if the characteristics 
could be inherited! -and since I 
was the one person on campus most 
obviously a mutandis 1 was setting 
a terribly bad example. Then see 
whether the other would suggest 
some sort of action. 

He said he would start right away 
and contact me as soon as he had 
some results. 



8 May. Solved. 

Beaumont called this morning 
with the good news that he had 
found the person responsible. No 
one 1 knew, he said; the person was 
an agitator who had been out of 
school for years and rarely showed 
up at club meetings. The three of us 
were going to meet at eight tonight 
by the sheds on the athletic field. 

I told him that I didn’t like it. At 
least two people had attacked me 
before and there might have been 
even more involved. 1 was still too 
weak to be of any help to my side if 
it came to violence and the ath- 
letic field was dangerously isolated. 
1 wanted simply to call the police 
and have my enemy apprehended, 
but Beaumont raised the good point 
that, without evidence, it would just 
be Beaumont’s word against the 



other’s — and the campus police 
were not noted for respecting the 
testimony of students. 

He said he could get his hands on 
a stunner to even out the odds and 
would bring a recorder to catch the 
person in damaging statements, if 
he couldn’t be goaded into action. I 
personally hoped he couldn’t. 

Beaumont had a regular script 
worked out, things for me to say to 
the man that were at once perfectly 
innocuous and calculated to make 
him lose his temper. Beaumont, of 
course, would be pretending to be 
on my enemy’s side. I agreed, with 
the private reservation that I would 
tone down some of my side of the 
dialogue. 

1 went to my morning classes as 
usual, but found 1 couldn’t 
concentrate for worrying. Anything 
could happen. This time of the year 
the athletic field was only airco’ed 
over weekends and I wasn’t sure I 
could make it back to a building in 
time if they overpowered us as they 
did me last time, taking our respira- 
tors. There was no guarantee that 
the man would show up alone or 
with just one accomplice. The more 
I thought about it, the more ner- 
vous 1 became. Finally, around 
noon, I went to the police. 

The chief was monumentally 
unimpressed. He said the whole

I insisted that they had tried to 
harm me seriously the night before

he could find a man to meet me 
■- there.

focus of some ruthless anli-sapiens 
' plot my action had only put Beau- 
i mont and me in even greater 
danger. 

I tried to reach Beaumont all day, 
I after that thought, to tell him the 

^ whole thing was off, but he was 

I never home. After a good deal of 

internal debate, 1 got up about 7:00 
i| p.M. and headed for the field. After 
j’ all, 1 had chastised Pamela for sug- 
f gesting cowardly action. I stopped 
in a general merchandise store on 
' the way and bought the biggest 
claspknife they had. I hadn’t fought 
^ anybody since I was a little boy and 
i didn’t know whether, should the 



time come to use the weapon I 
would have nerve or wit enough 
even to take it out of my pocket. 
But its weight was some small 
comfort. 

Everything happened very fast 
when it happened. I walked out 
onto the field and saw Beaumont 
standing by the sheds, chatting with 
another man. I approached them 
and waited for Beaumont to start 
the charade. They stopped talking 
as 1 came closer and suddenly 
Beaumont began to laugh hysteri- 
cally. The other, a muscular older 
man only slightly shorter than I - 
probably the tallest Earthie I had 
seen — smiled and drew a short 
wooden club out of his tunic. 

1 had the knife out and was trying 
to get my thumbnail into the little 
depression when Beaumont, still 
laughing, raised a stunner at me 
and fired. 

It was very painful. A stunner 
confuses the neural signals to and 
from the part of your brain that 
controls motor functions. A side ef- 
fect makes you feel as if your skin 
were being punctured by thousands 
of tiny needles. I fell to the ground, 
twitching spasmodically. My face 
was down, so 1 couldn’t see, but I 
heard Beaumont tell the big man to 
use the knife instead — it would be 
more impressive. 

Then absolutely nothing hap- 
pened for a long couple of minutes. 
Suddenly 1 was turned over roughly 
and steeled myself for the first blow 
of the knife — and found myself

looking into the face of the police 
chief. 

He sprayed an aerosol into my 
face — that made the pain go 
away — and said his men would take 
me to the infirmary, to a “pattern 
blocker,” to cure the paralysis. He 
apologized for using me as bait and 
said he had had a man hiding in the 
far shed since early this afternoon, 
waiting for Beaumont and his 
friend, who had been suspected in a 
similar assault case some months 
before. 

Both of them were lying on the 
ground, twitching as badly as 1 was. 
A large police floater drifted onto 
the field and two men with 
stretchers came out. 

They loaded up the others first 
and by the time my stretcher was 
secure, the chief was interrogating 
Beaumont, evidently with the aid of 
some hypnotic. His confession was 
disjointed and childishly vitupera- 
tive, but the gist of it was this: 

He had been after Pamela’s at- 
tentions (he used another word, 
which Chaucer would have 
recognized) for several months, and 
felt he was just about to succeed 
when 1 came along. 1 was an egotis- 
tical child, an alien and a cripple 
who, to his mind, had stolen her 
away. 

The chief questioned him further 
and found the Beaumont had suf- 
fered a nervous breakdown over a 
year before and had been under 
treatment until he came to the uni- 
versity. He admitted to several 



other acts of violence and admitted 
knowing that he was still mentally 
ill but had not volunteered for 
further treatment because he felt 
that the illness was somehow allied 
with his genius and he didn’t want 
to interfere with it. I felt that 
anything interfering with his brand 
of genius could only add to it, but I 
kept my own counsel. 

The infirmary treatment only 
took a few minutes. 1 arranged with 
the chief to come down the next 
morning to file a complaint and tes- 
tify, then found a phone and called 
Pamela. 

She was fascinated, but not sur- 
prised, with the revelations about 
Beaumont. 1 went over the whole 
thing in some detail, and then we 
talked about some more general 
matters and finally I got down to 
the question of our relationship. 
She said with some heat that the af- 
fair with Beaumont didn’t change 
anything, that if I knew anything 
about women I wouldn’t even have 
asked and that we could still be 
friends but that was all— a platonic, 
intellectual arrangement. 

While I’ve been writing this I’ve 
been thinking about what she said. 
I do know a little more about 
women than I knew a month ago. 
And a lot more about jealousy. And 
I’ve known about synergy for years.

LANDFALL — Spring One 

They stepped from the shuttle al- 
most reluctantly, a hundred and a 
half of them. From its zenith an 
alien sun cast painful brilliance 
against eyes accustomed to the 
gray-sky filtration of CityAmerica. 
The land that stretched from their 
feet was neither rolling, flowered 
meadow nor tender pasture. In- 
stead they faced an unprepossessing 
terrain of irregular hillocks and hol- 
lows that bristled with clumps of 
reed and coarse grass. 

This was the land they had to 



bring to fruit within five and one 
quarter settlement years if it were 
to be their home. Otherwise they 
would be returned to Earth and to 
the bottom of the planet-party list, 
those of them who chose to try 
again. 

Two of them were Cortlin and 
Valdez. 

DISCOVERY— Late Summer 
One: Cortlin 

The traditionalists among them 
took their day of rest on Sunday. 
But it was Tuesday when Cortlin 



97 



lay on his stomach in the coarse 
grass, watching what he had dub- 
bed the sick nest. Though he was 
hidden in the middle of a native 
community, he had to strain to 
catch the distant, low-pitched 
voices of its inhabitants. They num- 
bered about three dozen 
humanoids, their big tacky cano- 
pied nests spread wide afield. 

At last Cortlin heard stirrings 
within the nest. His body he bur- 
rowed deeper into the grass. His 
head he elevated, the woven reed 
camouflaging — he hoped — the 
fact that it was a head. A quarter- 
hour ago Znne had been carried 
into that nest, left leg jutting at an 
unnatural angle, pain contorting his 
gray features. 

Now he stepped from the nest be- 
hind the female N’Rila and the 
broken leg was whole again. 

Healed. 

Cortlin caught a deep breath and 
retracted his head. Healed! N’Rila 
was a healer. 

It seemed to him that the furious 
patter of his heart would lead the 
two natives to investigate. But they 
clumped away without sign. Not 
that these natives were given to 
signs anyway. They seemed as in- 
different to the Terran settlers as to 
everything else. Here was a race of 
humanoids living without tribal or- 
ganization, without land or even 
property codes, without passion or 
taboo, as nearly as Cortlin could 
determine. 

But these people obviously had 



one thing — a healer. Cortlin’s pre- 
vious observations of the sick nest 
had not been conclusive. Two ill- 
nesses swiftly reversed — but those 
could have been treated with herbal 
medicines. The stifling City- 
America privacy codes were tena- 
cious. Even Cortlin hadn’t yet mus- 
tered audacity to inspect the in- 
terior of that nest. 

But a broken leg — that couldn’t 
have been healed with any primitive 
pharmacopoeia. Glancing around, 
finding himself alone, Cortlin 
jumped to his feet and broke for the 
sick nest. 

And stopped short, frozen in his 
tracks. In the clump of reeds that 
grew behind the nest, swaying on a 
short woody stalk, cloudy gold eye 
fixed upon him, blue and green 
feathers ruffled -sat a noepti-noe. 
It blinked its clouded eye, flexed 
out its wings in an impassive boast 
of power. 

A bird. A parrot-sized blue-green 
bird with a red beak. Cortlin had 
seen them from a distance, had seen 
them rise on the sun-streaked air. 
He had heard native accounts of the 
bird’s effect upon the fertility of the 
land, too. And there, he decided, 
was one other thing these primitives 
had. A fertility god of sorts- the 
noepti-noe. 

Where noepti-noe chose to nest— 
they said — the reed clump would 
send up stalks hung with thick-skin- 
ned scarlet fruit. These could be 
eaten or drunk, depending upon the 
stage of ripeness. Then the stalks 



98 



GALAXY 



themselves could be boiled and 
eaten, sustaining life quite out of 
proportion to their fibrous ap- 
pearance. 

But if the bird were frightened 
tf from its nest or if death came to 
f it — whether naturally or by vio- 

[ lence— the reed clump would wither 

and die. For years there would be 
; barrenness in a radius of many 
yards. Even the grasses would fail 
to seed. 

. So this was the bird. Cortlin 
moved forward slowly. As he ap- 
, proached, the bird’s flexings and 
twitchings slowly ceased. Its eyes 
blinked almost somnolently. Then 
it stood perfectly still on one leg, its 
! left wing half-spread. The cloudy 
surface of its golden eye cleared and 
Cortlin was suddenly looking 
through the dilated pupil directly 
' into something wide and deep and 
blood red, something that pulsed 
thickly. 

Cortlin was scarcely aware of the 
rigidity of his body, of the fact that 
' he was suddenly bathed in per- 

spiration. Instead he was drawn 
totally into the eye of the bird, into 
I the hot, pulsating presence there. 

[ Abruptly the eye reclouded. The 
I bird settled slowly on both feet 

I and drew its wings prudishly about 

\ itself. 

i Cortlin’s body relaxed, sagged, 

j His clothes were soaked. The noon 

' breeze blew him cold. Shivering he 

backed away from the bird. 

I Bird — nothing but a bird 

preening itself on a short stalk that 



bulged with buds of plenty. 

A bird. Cortlin turned, stumbled 
away, cold and stunned. 

So stunned that he reached the 
perimeter of his own village before 
he remembered N’Rila, Znne, the 
broken leg that had healed so 
swiftly within the sick nest. He had 
discovered a healer. The fact would 
have to be communicated to 
Valdez. He would have to admit his 
spying activities. But the experience 
with the bird had overshadowed all 
that. 

DEBATE — Autumn One 

They had all heard rumors of 
Cortlin’s discovery, but because of 
the tenacity of the privacy codes no 
one had approached him directly 
for confirmation. The community 
hall, however, was filled to capacity 
the Friday after late planting, the 
date announced for Cortlin’s pre- 
sentation. His words were received 
with a silence as absorbent as a 
sound baffle. 

His speech was followed by the 
stiff debate of individuals who had 
lived most of their years in popula- 
tion-stifled CityAmerica. There the 
keen need for personal privacy had 
led to an almost pathological reluc- 
tance to speak out, to reveal the 
being sheltered within one, the 
being whose only sanctuary from 
pressing bodies and peering eyes 
was withdrawal. Debate followed 
two broad general lines. The 
mother ship had left drugs, supplies 
and antibiotics sufficient to meet 



t

any foreseeable medical crisis. Both 
Valdez and Nims had received 
medical training. The mother ship 
had left nothing, however, that 
could instantly heal bodily injury. 
And during the months of land- 
working and village-raising they 
had all become acutely aware of the 
vulnerability of human flesh. 

At the end of the evening Heads- 
man Valdez was delegated to ne- 
gotiate with the natives for emer- 
gency call upon their healer. 

NEGOTIATION — Autumn One: 

Valdez. 

When he sat at his secretary in 
the headsman’s dome or when he 
presided at community meetings, 
Valdez could forget that he led his 
group upon an alien world. But 
When he stepped out under the 
bowl of the sky and the musty scent 
of the reedlands reached him he was 
suddenly victim of anxiety. 

Today his shoulders knotted hard 
with it. Previous negotiations had 
demonstrated that these natives had 
no leader, no headsman, no one em- 
powered by the others to make de- 
cisions and grant concessions. 
There was only a wide-flung col- 
lection of big loose canopied nests 
inhabited by coequals. Conse- 
quently the best Valdez could do 
was enter the native village and 
speak with whomever he found at 
nest. So doing, he would receive not 
permission, but merely indifferent 
acceptance of the fact that the colo- 
nists would do what the colonists 



would do. All of which left Valdez 
with a nagging sense of alternatives 
unconsidered. 

Moving uneasily through the 
nesting field, glancing obliquely 
into the nests, he finally found an 
unpromising old male sheltering 
from the midday sun. The old man 
sat with his knees drawn up to his 
ears. His skin was leathery and 
gray, his eyes large and round and 
dull. 

Valdez squatted before the nest. 
The native language permitted him 
no greeting more eloquent than, 
“Morning.” 

“Morning,” came the rather 
disinterested reply. The round eyes 
rested on him fully, but without 
curiosity. 

Valdez sighed. It seemed no use 
to embroider his way to the point. 
“My people have sent me to ask 
permission to use your healer if an 
emergency ever arises in our set- 
tlement. Do you see that as pos- 
sible?” 

The round eyes blinked somno- 
lently. “I do not see it.” 

Valdez was startled. “You 
don’t?” This was not a response he 
had ever received before. “Why 
not?” 

The dull eyes blinked. “Wrong 
blood.” 

Valdez allowed a suitable interval 
to elapse. “Pardon?” 

“Wrong blood.” 

“Do you mean that she- the 
healer — works by exchanging blood 
with the injured person?” 



100 



GALAXY 



The old male wagged his head 
unenergetically. “I do not mean it.” 
“Oh? Then how does she heal?” 
“She puts her hand on.” 

Another suitable interval. “What 
makes her hand heal?” 

The round eyes blinked. “Long 
time, strangeone, a healer egg was 
left in an unused nest beyond the 
perimeter of here. One person who 
was harvesting grass seed found the 
egg. That year the people needed a 
healer. The one person carried the 
big egg here and a new nest was 
built. We all splashed sperm on the 
egg. It grew bigger. It became 
N’Rila. That is why her hands heal 
the people. Right sperm — right 
blood.” 

Valdez rocked back on his heels. 
“You mean that your healer is half 
native - half you- and half some- 
thing else?” The natives themselves, 
he knew were basically mam- 
malian. 

“The people fertilized the egg.” 
Valdez passed a hand over his 
eyes. An egg left in the field — in- 
credible. But the orientation studies 
he had completed to qualify for 
headsman had taught him that 
there was much that was incredible 
in the universe- and nothing that 
man could afford to reject arbit- 
rarily. “Then if there was another 
egg and my people splashed sperm 
on it - would it be right blood?” 

The old male nodded, rubbing his 
head noisily against his rough 
knees. “I see it.” 

“Are there often eggs?” 



“There is a healer egg now.” 

“There is? Where?” 

“In the nest beyond. It will rot 
there.” 

“But why?” 

“The people do not need a healer 
now.” 

The people didn’t, but the colo- 
nists did. Valdez was aware of a 
complex of emotions — excitement, 
urgency, revulsion. The suggestion 
that humans fertilize an egg re- 
volted him. “Maybe it already 
rots.” 

“No. It is fresh.” 

“It — where did it come come 
from?” 

“Who knows? It is there and it is 
big.” The oldster sketched an ovoid 
the sized of a football. 

Valdez frowned, hesitated. He 
knew how his men would react if 
they were asked to fertilize an egg. 
He also knew how they would react 
the first time someone died need- 
lessly. “Your healer— can she bring 
someone back who has already 
died?” 

There was a hint of expression in 
the round eyes. “Never a warm- 
dead one and never if death is al- 
ready coming. Never.” 

“You mean if the death processes 
have already begun there’s nothing 
she can do?” 

The old male actually seemed ca- 
pable of emotion. “Strangeone, if 
N’Rila touched and overcame 
death-coming N’Rila would be no 
healer afterward. The people would 
have no healer then.” 



NOEPTI-NOE 



101 



“Ah.” She could heal someone 
who lay dying, but would lose her 
healing powers in the process. But if 
eggs were readily available was that 
such a large price? “Are there many 
healer eggs?” . 

“There is orre now.” 

“No, I mean how often do you 
find them? How many do you let 
rot each year?” 

The old male clung stubbornly to 
his information. “There is one 
now.” 

Valdez sighed. “You would know 
if there were more?” 

“I would know if more were 
found.” 

So there was scarcity. Chances 
were great, too, that human males 
would not be able to fertilize such 
an egg. They could not eat native 
foods. Nevertheless Valdez decided 
to take a positive stand. “We would 
like to have that egg.” 

The old male’s rounded eyes 
again swam with expression. His 
head scraped his horny knees 
loudly. “Yes-yes, yes-yes,” he mut- 
tered. Then the head became still. 
“There is an offering, strangeone.” 

Valdez’ eyebrows rose. “To 
whom?” 

“To the power. When the people 
take a healer egg to fertilize, they 
bring to the empty nest an offering 
of seventy-five strangled noepti- 
noe." 

Valdez stared at the gray face, his 
jaw tightening. He had seen the 
noepti-noe soaring over the reed- 
lands, bright and fanciful and free. 



“The egg won’t hatch unless you 
make the offering?” 

“The egg will hatch, no matter. 
Noepti-noe are an offering to the 
power.” 

Valdez tried to keep indignation 
from his face. “My people would 
never make an offering of that na- 
ture. We come from a world where 
all the untamed birds have been of- 
fered— to one thing or another. 
That’s a condition we cannot 
meet.” 

The old male looked almost be- 
mused. “It is no condition. It is an 
offering.” 

“Well, it’s an offering that won’t 
be made by us.” 

The old male began to swing his 
head on his neck, abrading it noisily 
against his knees. 

“Is anyone going to help us find 
that egg if we refuse to make the of- 
fering?” 

The head rocked back and 
steadied. “C’narr’b will show you.” 

“And is there someone who will 
tell us how to fertilize the egg and 
care for it?” 

“I see that as possible.” 

Valdez stared at the old man for 
a time. “All right. Where do I find 
C’narr’b?” One thing he knew. He 
couldn’t ask his men to fertilize an 
egg any more than he could ask 
them to strangle birds. So the chore 
fell between himself and Cortlin. 

Well, Cortlin had gotten them 
into this. Valdez’ face set. Cortlin 
was going to pay the gate fee. And 
not in dead birds.

NEST EGG — Winter One: Cortlin 
and Valdez. 

They squatted before the nest for 
a long time in silence. The egg was 
exactly as it had been the week be- 
fore and the week before that — 
slightly larger and slightly rounder 
than a football, shell leathery white 
veined with blue and green. 

“C’narr’b says it happens occa- 
sionally,” Cortlin offered. “The 
fertilized egg lies dormant until 
spring, then suddenly grows and 
hatches out quite normally.” 
Normally? Valdez’ brows rose. 
They had made the nest themselves, 
woven it from cut reeds and bot- 
tomed it with dried grasses. It was 
situated near C’narr’b’s nest in the 
native settlement. They had trans- 
ported the egg there tenderly and 
Cortlin had done his duty, 
emerging tight lipped and scarlet. 

But the egg did not grow. Valdez’ 
mind turned reluctantly to the mat- 
ter of the offering. “What was your 
final figure on the bird popula- 
tion?” 

Cortlin rubbed his jaw. “I never 
reached a final figure per se. But I 
think we could knock seventy-five 
birds from the area without 
starving the natives out.” 

Valdez sighed. “You really see a 
connection between the birds and 
land fertility then?” 

“A definite correlation. I’ve spot- 
ted half a dozen noe nests with the 
skeletal remains of birds in them. 
Death was apparently from natural 
causes in every case. But the land 



was bare. Reeds wilted. Even the 
grasses hadn’t regenerated. If we 
take seventy-five birds we’re going 
to produce a lot of barren land.” 

Valdez nodded thoughtfully. 
“We’ll have to take the birds from 
the reedlands between native settle- 
ments — if it comes to that.” Not 
that the natives were likely to make 
violent reprisal. But there was no 
point in working hardship on the 
neighbors. 

Meanwhile there remained the 
egg, stubbornly dormant, un- 
changed in size since the fertiliza- 
tion over a month ago. His eyes 
returned to it. “If fertilization 
didn’t occur,how soon will signs of 
decay appear?” 

Cortlin grimaced. “If it didn’t 
take, the egg’s already deterio- 
rating. And it’s not going to do us 
any good to kill birds. We’ll just 
have to wait until another egg 
comes along — maybe next spring.” 

Valdez’ shoulders relaxed. “All 
right, then,” he said with finality, 
standing. “All we can do for the 
time being is consider methods of 
netting birds in case we need 
them.” 

Cortlin glanced at Valdez. A 
month ago the idea of killing birds 
had been anathema to the heads- 
man. But there had been two or- 
thopedic injuries in the settlement 
since. Two workers out of commis- 
sion for an indefinite period while 
bones healed. The matter of the 
healer had come up again at the last 
community meeting. 



NOEPTI-NOE

“I research netting noe on my 
own, I suppose,” Cortlin said. His 
fertilization of the egg, mercifully, 
hadn’t been noised abroad. 

“You do.” 

Cortlin scowled, ran a hand 
through his rough hair. “All right. 
But if we do have to make that of- 
fering, that’s one thing I’m not 
doing alone. You’re wringing just 
as many necks as 1 do.” 

Valdez, eyes were dark, troubled. 
‘Tm with you — if it becomes neces- 
sary.” 

“Good.” Cortlin stood, cast one 
last glance at the egg. He didn’t 
really believe the two of them 
would ever kill a bird. He had never 
yet approached noepti-noe without 
succumbing to the paralyzing 
power that lay behind the normally 
clouded surface of the eye. He 
doubted he ever would. This bird’s 
natural defenses were remarkably 
effective. 

II 

ANNIVERSARY— Spring Two. 

The settlers didn’t celebrate. The 
fields they had planted with late 
crops had borne nothing. Of their 
vegetables and grains, bred espe- 
cially for this climate, for this soil, 
for this season, there was no sign. 

Doggedly, without ceremony, 
they planted again. They had sup- 
plies for four and a quarter years 
longer on this world. They had 
seeds for an equal span. They would 
learn from this failure. 



But since no one could discern its 
cause they found difficulty in ex- 
tracting the meat from the lesson. 
Some of them began to have night- 
mares of gray skies of City America 
closing over them again, of the 
jostling bodies of billions of fellow 
Americans pressing them in, always 
in. 

NATIVITY— Late Spring Two: 
Valdez. 

The headsman sat stiff-bodied at 
his secretary, his eyes like empty 
screens. The message had come an 
hour ago, delivered by an anony- 
mous native to a worker at the edge 
of the colony fields. “The people 
see it as time for strangeone to 
come for the healer baby.” 

Just that, bald and unadorned. 
The field worker had delivered the 
message to Valdez and Valdez had 
nearly panicked. Hatched? He and 
Cortlin had inspected that egg a 
bare week ago and it had been 
scarcely bigger than last fall. Now 
they were to fetch the baby? 

Cortlin was on his way to the 
nest. And Valdez sat alone in his of- 
fice, his eyes staring starkly at the 
wall, a series of monstrous infant 
phantasms blossoming in his mind. 
He and Cortlin should have con- 
fided more details to the other set- 
tlers, he realized now. During their 
long vigil over the veined egg in its 
nest, amid their apprehensions and 
doubts he and Cortlin had become 
prepared for anything. But the 
others — all they had been told was

( 

- that Cortlin and Valdez were nego- 
. tiating the matter of a healer with 
the natives. 

A light rattle of knuckles came at 
*' his office door. He leaped up. 

, His visitor was not Cortlin but 
j' Nims, commander in chief of juve- 
5 nile services, which meant she 
1 taught the half-dozen older set- 

I tlement children and supervised

^ face a shy moonlet. 

#' Nims was brisk. “1 understand 
/ an infant is expected. Headsman. I 
think 1 should know what provision 

* has been made for its care.” 

* Frontal attack was the last thing 
^ Valdez was prepared to meet at this 

point. “1 none.” He had had an 
hour to initiate something 
anything. But he had been 
paralyzed by the superstitious fear 
^ that if he set gears in motion to re- 
^ ceive a normal human infant what 
Cortlin would deliver was that 
much more likely to be a mon- 
( strosity. 

Nims squared her shoulders, ex- 
pressed herself with the conscious 
1 valor of a soldier preparing to enter 
{ battle. “Patry and I would like offi- 
I' cial permission, then, to install a 
^ criblet and supplies here. I have al- 
J. ready arranged for Gomez to take 
g over my normal duties while 1 look 
[ after this infant. Patry will assist 

t' me if necessary.” 

Slowly Valdez' tension eased. At 
; least one of his people understood 
, that the expected baby might re- 



quire special attention. Might, in 
fact, best be segregated from the 
other normal infants. “That — that 
sounds like a practical ar- 
rangement,” he conceded. The fact 
that only one thin wall would sepa- 
rate his office from the nursery 
didn't mar his relief. 

Ten minutes later one portion of 
the headsman's dome had been 
converted. From the facility with 
which the nursery outpost was es- 
tablished it was apparent that Nims 
and Patry had pre-assembled its 
components. 

Enter Cortlin, unannounced, hair 
rough, face ruddy, carrying a 
bundle wrapped in big reed towels. 
“I've got her! Where's the scale?” 

Nims was on the dot with reas- 
surances. “I'll bring it immediately 
if the infant is frail or if it appears 
there is a feeding problem.” 

“Ha!” Cortlin plopped his bundle 
into the crib, unwound towels. “Fif- 
teen pounds is my bet. Anyone take 
me?” 

They stared at the abruptly bared 
little being in the crib. She was a 
perfectly formed human infant, 
plump, bright eyes intently occu- 
pied with one tight fist. Fine hair 
capped her head. Her flesh was rosy 
and firm. She appeared some weeks 
beyond the newborn phase. 

“Well!” Nims hefted the child 
professionally. 

Patry's young face hovered forth 
from obscuring clouds. “She's 
beautiful.” 

“Absolutely,” Nims confirmed. 



NOEPTI-NOE

“And very well nourished. Tell me 
about her diet, Mr. Cortlin.” 

“She doesn’t have one. Yet.” 
Cortlin’s eyes flashed to Valdez. 
“C’narr’b says nothing until she’s 
twenty-four hours old — and she’ll 
let us know when that is. Loud.” 
Patry touthed the infant’s bare 
foot. “Does she have a name?” 
Cortlin beamed. “Nilla Marie.” 
Valdez’ eyes caught Cortlin’s fat- 
uous, new-father grin, narrowed 
upon the infant. The hair, what 
there was of it, could be construed 
to have a tinge of Cortlin-red. The 
eyes certainly were bright and 
Cortlin-blue. Valdez felt a painful 
wrenching at his deepest human 
preconceptions. That Cortlin could 
consort with an abandoned egg in a 
makeshift nest and months later 
bring forth this. 

Nims laid the infant back in the 
crib. “And the mother has formally 
relinquished all claim to this 
child?” 

“No worry,” Cortlin bubbled, 
euphoric. “No mother.” 

Quickly Valdez launched expla- 
nations into the startled silence. 
“Healers are a purely local phe- 
nomenon — impossible to explain in 
terms of human reproduction. Ac- 
tually there is no female parent 
present to claim the child. That 
means that, for the time being, she 
is your responsibility, Nims.” 

Nims raised her chin gallantly, 
accepting the burden. 

“I don’t want anyone but Patry 
or yourself to handle her until we’ve 



discussed in meeting the implica- 
tions of her presence and the neces- 
sary restrictions on the use of her 
powers — if any.” 

“I certainly don’t propose to ex- 
pose the child to the community at 
large,” Nims replied with asperity. 
“Now that I have seen her I will re- 
quest Mr. Cortlin to help me 
transfer her crib and equipment to 
my private quarters. 1 will seclude 
her there for observation and stabi- 
lization for a number of days, per- 
haps for a full week. Thereafter I 
will transfer her to the nursery for 
day care and will continue to pro- 
vide after-hours mother care 
myself. I intend to handle this child 
as much like a normal infant as 
possible.” 

Valdez nodded, the weight of re- 
sponsibility easing with Nims’ im- 
mediate and assertive advocacy of 
the infant. 

When the baby’s equipment had 
been moved the two men found 
themselves deserted. “Thus al- 
ways,” Cortlin commented. “New 
father out in the cold, unsung, 
unacknowledged.” 

“1 thought that was how you 
wanted it.” 

Cortlin shrugged enigmatically. 

“Well, you can keep involved by 
helping me set up tonight’s 
meeting. We’ll have to get it across 
immediately that there are limits to 
that child’s use - assuming she 
really has healing power.” 

Cortlin grinned, flashed the heel 
of his hand before Valdez’ face. 



106 



GALAXY 



“She’s got it.” 

Valdez’ glance had caught the 
hand in passing. “What?” 

The hand returned, hovered, 
turned for inspection. “That gash I 
got last week in the field.” 

Valdez stared. He had seen the 
wound earlier today, deep, ugly, 
scabbed under its plastispray dress- 
ing. Now it was gone. A dozen 
questions concentrated on the tip of 
his tongue. But the enormity of the 
thing locked his jaw. 

They had a healer. 

“Guess I’m off bird patrol now. 
Agreed?” 

Valdez could find no comment. 
He nodded. 

HARVEST— Fall Two. 

Their first harvest was a 
mockery. That spring they had cast 
bushels of seeds across their pre- 
pared lands. Weeks later a few pale 
seedlings had straggled up out of 
the soil, all of them from pulp 
melon stock X57. A scattering of 
those had actually survived the 
summer to bear sickly fruit. The 
entire harvest was carried back to 
the settlement in six bushel 
containers and left in the coolshed 
to keep or to rot, according to the 
will of providence. 

The settlers themselves withdrew 
to their private quarters. Winter 
gloom fell early. 

CONNECTION— Winter Two: 
Cortlin. 

Officially Cortlin was off bird pa- 
trol. Unofficially he was still on his 



belly in the mud. And it struck him 
suddenly that he had most of his 
great thoughts here. Because today 
as he squirmed through the stuff, 
angling closer to the noe nest in that 
huge clump of reeds, his progress 
impeded by the very luxuriance of 
vegetation generated by the noe's 
presence, it hit him. 

Why their fields were barren. 

Their first action upon landfall 
had been to clear their prenego- 
tiated farmland. They had not 
taken time until later to orient 
themselves, to learn the simplistic 
native language. They had simply 
landed and proceeded to uproot 
everything. 

Including the reed clumps that 
were the natural nesting places of 
the noepti-noe. By destroying the 
nesting reeds they had blighted 
their own lands! And within days of 
landfall, at that. 

Had Cortlin been a field worker, 
had he noted the birds flying up 
from their devastated homes, he 
might have made this connection 
earlier. But at the time he had been 
concerned with the supervision of 
the disbursement of building mate- 
rials from the shuttle that had 
landed them on the site of the vil- 
lage. 

Question now was, could they re- 
store land fertility immediately by 
enticing the birds back? Or was the 
time of blight fated to run its 
course? 

Cortlin frowned with thought. 
These birds were baffling. He had 



NOEPTI-NOE 



107 



yet to see the inside of a noe nest. 
Let him come too near, and a noe 
unfailingly appeared, either from 
within the nest or from the skies. 
Let him press the matter and the 
bird’s eye cleared, its pupil dilated 
and Cortlin felt himself drawn help- 
lessly into the pulsing red river that 
lay beneath. 

That never failed to ruin his day. 

Now he began a quick, wriggling 
retreat. Whether restoring the birds 
to settlement lands would make the 
crucial difference or not, he had to 
get his thought to Valdez. It was 
too big to carry alone. 

DEBATE — Late Winter Two. 

There was no debate. Neither 
was there any optimism. At the end 
of the wet season reed clumps 
would be dug from uninhabited 
lands beyond the settlement and 
would be replanted in the com- 
munal fields. Cortlin would make 
every attempt to develop a method 
of luring the bright birds to nest in 
the human Helds again. 

And no one would expect a thing. 

“There’s no point in attempting 
to cultivate the reedlands 
themselves,” Valdez explained. 
“One — we have treaty rights only 
to this preserve of land. And two — 
the activity involved in draining and 
breaking up the reedland soil and 
preparing it for our crops would un- 
doubtedly drive the birds from their 
present nests there and we’d be 
right back to point-go again.” 



Point-go was apathy, communal 
and complete. 

JOLT — Spring Three: Valdez 
Valdez was at his desk in the 
headsman’s dome when Tagnari 
appeared at the door. “Acci- 
dent — ” he panted. Field dust had 
turned to mud on his sweat-soaked 
worksuit. 

Valdez stood up. “Where?” 
“Sector, seventeen — Gillard, sir, 
under his tractor.” 

“Get the scooter. I’ll fetch Nilla 
and Nims.” It was a standing order 
that the healer was never used in 
emergency without Valdez’ consent 
or without Nims in attendance. To 
date, luckily, there had been few 
non-routine calls upon Nilla’s 
services. 

The settlement’s only hover- 
scooter bobbed across the field, 
dodging newly replanted reed 
clumps. Valdez’ glance fell across 
the child in Nims’ arms. Her hair 
was more brightly tinged with red 
than it had been even a month ago. 
And she was growing rapidly. Less 
than a year old, she had the ap- 
pearance and general ability of a 
normal three-year-old. 

But despite the uncanny power 
that lay in her hand she was only a 
child. And when he reached Sector 
17 and saw the silent knot gathered 
in the fresh furrows Valdez hopped 
quickly from the cart. “Keep her 
here — and keep her head turned 
away if you have to.” Until now 
there had been no need to present 



108 



GALAXY 



the child with a brutally disturbing 
scene. 

This was a bad one. Valdez made 
his way to the center of the knot 
and kneeled. And there was no 
doubt in his mind that Gillard was 
in the condition the natives called 
“death-coming.” For one thing, his 
chest had been crushed. For 
another, both legs were mangled. 
The soil was bloody around him. 

His wife was bloody beside him. 
Her dark eyes were enormous. She 
spat words at him: “Where is the 
healer?” 

Valdez kept his voice low. “We 
can’t use her here, Hil.” 

Hil Gillard did not keep her own 
voice down. It burst from her with 
fury. “Where can we use her then? 
What is she doing in our place?” 

“Hil, this is exactly the situation 
we discussed in meeting when Nilla 
first came. If we permit her to 
touch Gil now her powers will be 
sacrificed. She’ll be just a child like 
any other child and we’ll have no 
healer. We all agreed ” 

“We all sat while you and Cort 
agreed! I said nothing! Luis said 
nothing!” 

Nims had slipped between them 
to kneel beside the injured man. 
She handled his wrist, touched his 
neck. “Headsman, this man is 
dead.” 

Hil Gillard was briefly silent. 
Then she sprang at Valdez. 

The tussle was brief. Pulled from 
the headsman, she glared at them 
all, hands and face dark with her 



husband’s blood. Then she wheeled 
and flung across the field toward 
the reedlands. 

“Tagnari keep her in sight.” 
Valdez turned to Nims. “Nilla?” 

“1 instructed her to wait at the 
scooter.” 

Valdez nodded. The knot around 
Gillard had loosened. “We'll have 
to transport him back to the 
settlement.” 

“I believe we must first wait until 
final death occurs,” Nims said 
quietly. 

Valdez’ head snapped up. “I 
thought you said he was dead.” 

“He is, for all practical purposes. 
However, there is still a faint 
pulse.” 

Valdez stared at her. 

“I could see no point in torturing 
Hil, Headsman. Would you like me 
to call Nilla to confirm my 
judgement.” 

Valdez licked his drying lips. 
“I no. No.” He himself had seen 
that death was with them. He 
squatted, took up the limp wrist. 

Several minutes later the erratic 
pulse was gone. Valdez stood. 
“Now we can think of moving 
him.” But no one moved, least of 
all Valdez. It was time, he saw, pub- 
licly to assign Cortlin the job of ob- 
taining another healer egg. 

BIRD PARTOL — Summer Three: 
Cortlin 

But healer eggs were out of 
season and Cortlin had other irons 
in his fire. He stood beside his 



NOEPTI-NOE 



109 



newly erected dome in the far 
corner of the settlement fields. The 
prospect across the fields was 
broken now by scattered clumps of 
reeds. 

The reeds were a failure. The 
birds had refused to be lured to the 
human lands. The reeds — Cortlin 
had necessarily chosen clumps 
uninhabited by noe — had survived 
transplantation to wither a few days 
later of the noe curse that afflicted 
the settlement lands. 

Doggedly the settlers replaced a 
half-dozen clumps each day. But 
even the fresh clumps attracted no 
birds. 

Cortlin ran a hand through his 
rough red hair, turned a glance 
upon the dome he had erected, his 
birdatory. It encompassed three 
freshly transplanted reed clumps, a 
corresponding amount of bare soil 
and it was off limits to every human 
but himself. Stone markers carried 
the boundaries of his private 
preserve some yards beyond the 
dome itself. 

He heard a harking cry from the 
reedlands. C’narr’b appeared with 
birding net, an implement with a 
handle of reed stalk and a 
drawstring bag of woven grasses. In 
his other hand he carried a small, 
densely woven bag. 

Cortlin met him. He had in- 
spected the bird net previously. 
Now that he was ready to go into 
the field, however, the implement 
looked ridiculously fragile. “The 
noe doesn’t struggle at all?” 



“Never.” C’narr’b was a stringy 
old fellow, fast on his feet and 
muddy gray. He had large round 
eyes and a mouth bulging with 
horny yellow chewing surfaces. 

“I hope he doesn’t change his 
mind today.” 

In the no man’s land between 
native settlements the reeds grew in 
great mounds with coarse grasses 
flowing between them. Spotted 
throughout the wilderness were de- 
crepit native nests used as occa- 
sional retreats or for shelter when 
bad weather overtook seed 
gatherers. 

“The people take noe only from 
places where the birds nest thick,” 
C’narr’b explained. “The land is 
not stripped then. There are other 
noe near to keep it.” 

Deep in the reedlands Cortlin and 
the native selected their clump and 
moved through the grassy growth 
toward it. Alerted, a single noe ap- 
peared from his nest at the heart of 
the clump. He hopped to a reed 
stalk and bobbed there nervously, 
his cloudy golden eye blinking 
rapidly. 

C’narr’b took his bearings and 
then pulled the densely woven grass 
bag down over his head and face. 
“Run beyond reach of the power 
now.” 

Cortlin quickly scrambled away. 
He called the go-ahead when he was 
safely situated. The native ad- 
vanced cautiously, long toes grip- 
ping the ground, bird net held erect. 

“To your right,” Cortlin called 



110 



GALAXY 



when Cnarr’b deviated slightly. 

On its perch the bird flexed its 
wings and uttered a warning cry. 

Then the bag-blinded native was 
within net's reach. “Net forward,” 
Cortlin called. 

The grass net reached. The bird 
seemed to see it for the first time. 
The noe bobbed nervously, uttered 
one last cry and became still. 

“Net up and to your right.” 

The bird went into a crouch. One 
wing flexed out slowly. Cortlin 
tensed. But when the clouded lens 
of the bird's golden eye cleared, 
when its pupil dilated, he was unaf- 
fected. He was beyond the range of 
the bird's paralyzing power. He 
made a quick mental note of his 
distance. 

Now the native’s net hovered di- 
rectly over the bird. “Net down!” 
Cortlin’s voice rose. “Now — pull 
your drawstring.” 

The noe was bagged. And it 
didn't struggle. Its feathered body 
relaxed in the closed net. Its golden 
eyes clouded and shut. 

Cortlin approached apprehen- 
sively. “Did we hurt him?” 

“The bird is not hurt.” 

“And he isn’t going to turn on the 
power again?” It couldn’t be this 
easy. 

It was. “There is always one last 
flash of power. Then the bird is 
quiet. For when he sees the net he 
understands he is being taken for 
sacrifice.” 

Cortlin stared at the bright, 
bagged bird. He found it difficult to 



believe the bird held any such pre- 
conception. “And you’ve never 
tried keeping a bird? For 
observation?” 

“Observation of what?” the 
native wondered, round-eyed. 

Cortlin shrugged. These people 
seemed to suffer no pangs of 
curiosity. 

He himself suffered other 
pangs — those of apprehension. 
How long would it take this bird to 
recover from the passive state? 
Would it? If it remained passive, 
would it eat and take water? Or 
would it dehydrate and starve in his 
painstakingly erected birdatory, 
leaving him with a handful of 
feathers and three clumps of wilting 
reeds? 

As they pushed through the reeds 
Cortlin’s eye was on the bird. He 
began to wish that population pres- 
sure in CityAmerica had not 
rendered his education so brief, so 
perfunctory. 

But what specialized knowledge 
could serve him now? Bird 
psychology? 

Ill 

NEST EGG II — Early Autumn 
Three: Cortlin 

Cortlin moved through the fields 
at mid-morning. Across the broad 
prospect of settlement land a few 
pale melon vines crawled between 
withered clumps of reed. An occa- 
sional stalk of stunted corn threw a 



NOEPTI-NOE 



111 



brief shadow. Rather than work 
this taunting harvest the settlers 
had elected to search the reedlands 
for healer eggs. Cortlin fervently 
hoped Valdez’ effort to save them 
from total apathy would succeed. A 
few weeks ago, with the same end in 
mind, Valdez had space-called 
EarthAuthority and urgently reque- 
sted a fresh shipment of seeds. 

The reply had been swift and 
brutal. The seeds shipped with the 
settlers had been scrupulously fresh 
and carefully bred for local climate 
and soil conditions. This group of 
settlers had the same choice as any 
other group of settlers sponsored by 
EarthAuthority — make their planet 
yield or return to Earth. 

Cortlin sighed, glancing at wilted 
reeds. The field workers had balked 
by midsummer, at the constant 
transplantation of fresh clumps. 
And the dozens of noe he and 
C’narr’b had netted and tried to set- 
tle in the fields had long since taken 
to the sky. 

Only the three noepti-noe con- 
signed to the closed dome of the 
birdatory remained. They behaved 
most unnoely. They ate, drank and 
sat on their perches, bobbing their 
bright heads monotonously. Cortlin 
was permitted to touch therh, to 
handle them, to inspect the nests 
they had woven with materials he 
had gathered. Not once since cap- 
ture had a noe cleared the cloud 
from its eye and paralyzed him with 
enigmatic red power. Neither had 
any noe attempted escape. 



Still awaiting sacrifice? He 
wondered. 

The boundaries of his private 
preserve marked a sharp change in 
crop status. Here it had been neces- 
sary to thin stalks and vines to 
maintain a path to the door of the 
dome. Inside the dome the situation 
was even greener. His tomato crop 
prospered. Big red globes hung 
waiting. He studied them without 
expression, then slung the bag off 
his shoulder, picked the day’s yield 
and set it outside. 

His birds greeted him with their 
usual total reserve. He waded the 
tomato patch and took their water 
trough to be refilled with odorous 
reedland water, the only liquid they 
would accept. Food and water at- 
tended to, he approached each nest 
in turn, spoke to each bird, was 
greeted by each with an aloof 
golden stare. 

He was greeted, too, at the third 
nest, by an egg - a leathery white 
egg smaller than an Earthside hen’s 
egg, vividly veined with blue and 
green. Cortlin’s heart took a brief 
vacation. He stared at the egg. De- 
spite its size it had a terrifyingly fa- 
miliar look. With stiff fingers, he 
touched it. 

It throbbed. 

He looked up and found its 
parent eying him. His lips began to 
shape a question. Before he voiced 
it the cloudy golden surface of the 
bird’s eye cleared. The dark pupil 
dilated. And Cortlin fell into a hot, 
red stream of power that beat and

J pulled at him with a thick, 
strangling rhythm. 

, Then the bird was a bird again 
A and Cortlin was able to move his 
^ tortured muscles. He stared at the 
creature on the perch. His lips were 
stiff. “Who are you?” 

I The bird made no answer. 

Impulsively Cortlin reached into 
the nest and seized the little egg. He 
held it in his palm, feeling the hot 

i throb of it. “I’m going to take your 
egg.” 

The bird twitched and began to 
clean its feathers. 

“I'm going to take your baby and 
hide it.” 

He did. He found a native nest 
L near the edge of the settlement 
^ fields and left the little white egg 
K there. The palm of his hand throb- 
B bed as he walked away from it and 
in his head was a pain. And he had 
just one fervent wish — that no 
noepti-noe ever lay an egg in his 
birdatory again. 

When he went back next day the 
little egg had grown. It was a me- 
dium size egg. Two days later a 
if” search party found it and carried it 
P triumphantly home. It was the size 
ii; of an underinflated football by 
■' then. 

m. ACTIVITY— Winter Three 

The notable feature of the pre- 
i vious winter had been apathy. The 
1 notable feature of this one was 
r activity. 

f Two things had happened that 
fall. First a search party had dis- 



covered the healer egg and turned it 
over to Headsman Valdez and his 
special assistant, Cortlin. Next, and 
almost simultaneously, the melons, 
squash and corn planted around 
Cortlin’s bird dome had suddenly 
spurted. The effect had extended 
slightly beyond the stone border 
Cortlin had laid to mark his terri- 
tory. The resultant harvest was not 
by any standards staggering, but it 
was far more substantial than any 
they had experienced on this world 
to date. 

Now, in the cold and wet of 
winter, parties brought cut grasses, 
reeds and reed stalks from the reed- 
land areas. These were being dried 
in every available spot, including 
private quarters. Not a settler could 
be found who didn’t carry the 
musty reed smell on him. Because 
there were not sufficient artificial 
materials to erect bird domes over 
the entire span of settlement fields 
it was necessary to weave large 
cages of natural materials to house 
the noepti-noe they would net from 
the reedlands that spring. 

They needed almost one hundred 
such cages. The settlers were busy. 

NATIVITY II— Spring Four: 

Cortlin 

Knowing what he did, Cortlin ex- 
pected to find the second healer in- 
fant alien. But she was very much 
like any human infant when he 
lifted her from her burst shell in the 
native village. Her hair was darker 
than Nilla’s. Her eyes were darker. 



NOEPTI-NOE 



113 



too, but alert and blue. She was 
smaller than Nilla had been, wirier. 
But he could find nothing alien in 
the cast of features or in the 
thrashing activity of small limbs. 

Nevertheless, as he carried her 
toward the settlement, he was the 
victim of deep misgivings. He 
reached the edge of the communal 
fields. Already two dozen fresh 
reeds clumps had been planted and 
capped with big handmade cages 
within which noepti-noe perched 
placidly. Cortlin felt threatened by 
their bright-feathered proximity. 
What he understood about these 
birds, he realized, was quite insig- 
nificant in comparison to what he 
had yet begun to comprehend. 

TROUBLING THOUGHTS— 
Summer Four: Valdez 

Valdez shook his head thought- 
fully, his eyes intent upon his com- 
panion. He remembered the Cortlin 
of four years ago. Open-minded, 
driven by curiosity, he had been the 
colonist least constrained by the in- 
hibiting privacy codes. But as the 
others had gradually opened up 
Cortlin had withdrawn, had begun 
to spend more time alone, burdened 
with inward occupation. His face 
reflected this change. 

“No, Cort, I see what we’ve done 
with these birds as a parallel to the 
domestication of, say, cattle and 
oxen. We’ve harnessed their pro- 
ductivity to our own ends — even if 
we don’t fully understand its 
source.’’ 



The settlement fields were lush 
and green this summer, thick with 
growth. 

Cortlin ran an expressive hand 
through his hair. “What I’m trying 
to get across — you’re drawing 
parallels that would apply if we 
were on Earth. But we’re here. And 
those birds aren’t oxen. They’re — 
do you you know why I think 
they’re sitting there in their cages? 
Just sitting?’’ 

Valdez shook his head. 

“I think they’re waiting to be sac- 
rificed,’’ Cortlin said. 

Valdez frowned. “1 really don’t 
see how a bird could comprehend a 
concept like that, Cort.’’ 

“Neither do I. Sometimes I think 
these birds may be the real high- 
order inhabitants of this place. And 
I think it may be the natives who 
are domesticated in some cockeyed 
way we can’t understand - just as 
we can’t understand the birds.’’ 

Valdez carefully avoided the use 
of Cortlin’s own word — cockeyed. 
“That’s an odd way of looking at 
things. If that were the case, why 
would the birds — the higher-order 
life form — permit themselves to be 
captured and strangled by the 
natives?” 

“Because they need the natives. 
They have to keep them operating 
at top efficiency through the 
healers.” 

“Which they could accomplish 
without sacrificing themselves. 
We’ve proved that, you know. We 
have two healers, both working out 



114 



GALAXY 



beautifully — and we’ve sacrificed 
no birds.” 

i Cortlin made a nervous gesture. 
“That’s just it, Val. The pieces are 
scattered all over the board. 1 can’t 
^ fit them.” 

f “Mmm. Maybe you’re trying to 
P assemble too many different puz- 
r zles on the same table. Or maybe 
f there are key pieces on the floor 
under the table.” Valdez’ eyes 
leveled with Cortlin’s. “Or maybe 
I you’re one of those people who 
I* can’t handle prosperity. You expect 
i. the worst — and you’re more upset 
‘ when it doesn’t come than when it 
L does.” 

Cortlin shook his head emphati- 
cally. “No. I’m just trying to put 
things together, that’s all.” 

I When Cortlin had gone Valdez 
sat troubled. Nilla had shown 
: ability to deal with manic depres- 

^ sive psychoses and schizophrenia. 
But if this emotional syndrome 
Cortlin evinced were not firmly 
based in physiological causes, could 
she counter it? 

Valdez found it impossible to re- 
main troubled long. He himself had 
no complicated reaction to good 
fortune. The fields blossomed. The 
settlement blossomed. His own wife 
blossomed. Their first child would 
be born before winter. It was not 
difficult to reject Cortlin’s 
forebodings. 

BUMPER CROP— Fall Four: 
Valdez 

A week to ten days? Valdez 



looked out over the prospect of 
fields and wondered why Cortlin 
had insisted that the harvest would 
be delivered so soon. The corn was 
immature. The melons were small 
and hard. The other crops were in a 
corresponding state of unreadiness, 
except for the tomatoes. But 
Cortlin had seemed quite positive — 
as well as agitated. And the plants 
themselves, although their fruits 
were immature, grew thick and 
dark and full of vigor. 

Well, if Cortlin’s prediction were 
reliable, if these crops were about 
to spurt as the plants in and around 
Cortlin’s dome had spurted last 
fall, it was fortunate they had com- 
pleted the hose system. Because it 
had been five weeks since rain. 
These plants needed water if they 
were readying for a precipitant 
growth and ripening. 

Standing with hose in hand, 
Valdez experienced one of his in- 
creasingly frequent moments of 
deep satisfaction. There was a 
feeling of community in the fields 
today. Everyone had come out for 
the initiation of the hose system ex- 
cept the youngest children and their 
attendants, Patry and Bonds. The 
feeling of communal exuberance 
was an airborne tonic. 

Their first major crop was bn its 
way. 

Valdez’ mood did not alter appre- 
ciably when word came that he was 
required in Sector 23. “On my 
way.” He laid down his hose, dried 
his hands on his worksuit and loped 



NOEPTl-NOE 



115 



casually across rows of green. 

When he reached 23 he realized 
that misfortune was possible even 
today. Nims lay unconscious on the 
ground in the shade of a reed 
clump. Her older pupils clustered 
anxiously around her. 

“We pulled her over here when 
she fell down. We thought it might 
be heat stroke.” 

Valdez examined his fallen com- 
mander in chief of juvenile services. 
He didn’t like what he found. “How 
did she fall?” he demanded sharply. 
“Easily or hard?” 

The oldest child answered. “She 
was standing there telling us— 
telling us about things — and then 
she fell hard. It made a noise.” 
Valdez glanced around quickly 
for an implement or clod that might 
have rendered her unconscious had 
she struck her head upon it in 
falling. There was nothing. Nor was 
there any wound upon her head. 
“Did someone go for Nilla?” 
“Cort did.” 

Valdez nodded, staring at the still 
woman. He had no one with whom 
to share his apprehensions. The 
only other member of the party 
who had gone through the medical 
course lay at his feet. 

Her students were eager to help. 
“Downy thought we should wash 
her face with cold water.” 

Valdez shook his head. “I don’t 
think that would help.” 

The hover-scooter appeared, bob- 
bing, bearing Cortlin, Patry, Nilla 
and the younger healer, Kinnie. 



Nilla, at two and a half years, had 
the stature and composure of a ten- 
year-old. She kept that composure 
when she saw her adoptive mother 
lying inert on the wet ground. 

And why not? Valdez mused. To 
Nilla illness was not tragedy, not 
even cause for minor anxiety. 
Illness was simply a condition to be 
neutralized. “I think the trouble is 
in her head,” he explained. 

Accordingly the child applied the 
back of her right hand to her 
mother’s head in a diagnosing ca- 
ress. Briefly she shut her eyes. 

Then, instead of turning the hand 
to apply the healing power of the 
palm, she drew it back. Her eyes 
opened. They held a small flicker of 
expression. “She has a clot closing 
up a big blood vessel in her brain. 
It’s been there too long now.” 

Valdez flinched. Only minutes 
had elapsed, but the final death pro- 
cesses were already underway. 

“Do you want me to take care of 
it?” Nilla asked hopefully. 

He stared at her. But of course — 
why did they have a second healer if 
not for an emergency like this? He 
wondered briefly if his own son or 
daughter would ever know fear in 
the presence of near-death -or 
would instead regard it casually as 
a reversible state. 

“We can use Kinnie if you’d 
rather.” The child understood that 
her powers would be lost if applied 
in circumstances like these. 

“No, it’s all right. 1 don’t mind.” 

He saw that she meant it. That 



116 



GALAXY 



she understated, in fact. “All right, 
Nilla. Take care of her please.” 

The child’s face became still, all 
attention focused inward. Her hand 
reached out again, rested palm 
down on Nims’ head. Valdez 
watched intently. Usually when she 
applied her palm she briefly closed 
her eyes. This time she didn’t. 

Valdez didn’t realize what was 
happening until it had already hap- 
pened, until the dark pupils of 
Nilla’s eyes had opened and he 
found himself pulled downward 
into something red and gluey and 
hot that throbbed. Helplessly he felt 
his body stiffen convulsively, heard 
his spine pop in protest. 

. .heard Cortlin groan thickly, 
“No!” 

He heard something else, too, 
what seemed an age later. Alien 
cries rose from the fields all around, 
hoarse and penetrating cries of 
scalding agony. 

He had no way of timing his pa- 
ralysis. But finally the pupils of 
Nilla’s eyes closed and the red 
power was shielded. And Valdez 
was able to move his body. 

He was peripherally aware that 
Nims stirred. But more he was 
aware of a last dying shriek from 
the fields. His eyes went to 
Cortlin’s, met another agony there. 

“The noe?" he whispered 
numbly. 

Cortlin, too, was stunned and 
slow. “They’ve been sacrificed,” he 
said thickly. “They were waiting 
for it.” Cortlin rose to his feet. 



stumbled to the nearest reed clump. 
He pulled back the big cage and 
reached into the nest. The bird he 
brought forth was limp, its bright 
feathers tarnished, its eyes bulging. 
Cortlin stared at it, then shook it. 
“Who are you? IVho are you?" 

The bird didn’t answer. It was 
dead, as were most of the others 
that had been brought to nest in the 
settlement fields. 

Valdez began to shake helplessly. 
Because he knew that if his ears 
were keener, he would hear another 
sound from the fields. He would 
hear their stalks and vines 
shriveling in death, taking their im- 
mature fruits with them. 



DEPARTURE — Summer Five: 
Valdez 

The shuttle sat at the edge of the 
field. Nims turned as she boarded, 
raised her hand in farewell. 
Valdez returned the salute. His 
brisk little commander in chief 
had been firm in her refusal to 
chance imposing a second life-or- 
death decision upon him. 

The more than seven dozen 
others who accompanied her on the 
return trip went for a different 
reason. 

“We’re well off without them,” 
Cortlin observed. 

Valdez nodded, reluctantly 
agreeing. After the fall crop 
disaster the community had 
divided sharply. Half his people 
had retired to their private 



NOEPTl-NOE 



117 



quarters and put forth no further 
effort. Unable to cope with the 
scope of the disaster or with the 
fact that there was no comprehend- 
ing the forces behind it they had 
refused to do more than exist until 
the shuttle came for them. 

But others had been mobilized 
by crisis, had worked like oxen, 
disposing of the seventy-five dead 
noe, digging out the reed clumps 
that had followed them in death, 
plowing under the withered crops. 
Bringing in more reeds, more noe, 
doggedly planting late crops. 

The late crops had delivered. 
Now there was food to carry them 
through summer and fall — those 
who were staying. And they were 
willing to accept that slim margin 
of survival. 

The shuttle captain was a con- 
scientious man and worried. “You 
understand there won’t be anyone 
back this way for another five 
years. Head. And I’m not au- 
thorized to leave you'any more food 
supplies.” 

“We understand. We’ve dis- 
cussed it in meeting.” 

“All right. Sign and we’ll un- 
load.” 

Gravely Valdez signed for herds 
of embryonic sheep and cattle, for 
equipment to carry the embryos to 
birth-stage and for concentrated 
feed to maintain them through their 
first year, until the seeds that ac- 
companied them could be parlayed 
into feed. 

The livestock was unloaded. 



Then the shuttle closed its doors 
and pulled up into the sky, be- 
coming a bright fleck in the 
distance. 

When- it was gone Valdez’ eyes 
moved over their world, over fields 
green with crops, over the domes of 
the settlement, over the reedlands. 
He was keenly aware that there 
were just sixty-odd of them alone 
on a world they had barely begun to 
understand. He was even more 
keenly aware of the presence of the 
birds in his fields. 

“You ever wonder what they’ll 
find when they do get back?” 
Cortlin mused. 

Valdez studied Cortlin. His bird 
expert had changed again. “You 
know, once the worst happened, 
Cort, you cheered up.” 

Cortlin smiled. “What makes 
you think the worst has happened?” 

Valdez looked out into the fields. 
He still held a vivid memory of 
Cortlin’s question the day of the 
crop disaster: Who are you? It 
repeated itself in his mind every 
time he met the golden eye of the 
noepti-noe. And he knew it was a 
question he was unlikely to see an- 
swered. “Well, I’m hoping we know 
everything now that can harm us 
seriously.” 

“Hope you’re not counting on 
that too hard.” 

“I’m not,” Valdez admitted. The 
only thing he was counting on was 
that the gray skies of City America 
would never close over him again. 
He walked under open sky. ★

G rimes was packing his 

overnight bag without much 
enthusiasm. 

“Do you have to go?” asked 
Sonya. 

He replied rather testily, “1 don’t 
have to do anything. But the light- 
jammers have always been my ba- 
bies and I've always made a point 
of seeing them in and seeing them 
out.” 

“But Coldharbor Bay? And in 
midwinter? There are times, my 
dear, when I strongly suspect that I 
married a masochist.” 

“If only you were a sadist we’d 
live happily forever after,” he re- 
torted. “And if you were a maso- 



chist you’d be coming with me to 
Port Ericson.” 

“Not bloody likely,” she told 
him. “Why you couldn’t have ar- 
ranged for your precious lightjam- 
mers to berth somewhere in what 
passes for the Tropics on this 
dismal planet is beyond my com- 
prehension.” 

“There were reasons,” he said. 

Yes, there were reasons, one of 
the most important being that a 
lightjammer is a potential super- 
bomb with a yield greatly in excess 
of that of the most devastating nu- 
clear fusion weapon. The essential 
guts of a star-sailer is the sphere of 
anti-matter, contraterrene iron, 
held suspended in vacuum by 
powerful magnetic fields. In theory 



119 



there is no possibility that the anti- 
matter will ever come in contact 
with normal matter — but history 
has a long record of disasters giving 
dreadful proof that theory and 
practice do not always march hand 
in hand. The terminal port for the 
lightjammers, therefore, was 
located in a region of Lorn unin- 
habited save by a handful of fur 
trappers. It would have been at the 
South Pole itself but for the neces- 
sity for open water, relatively ice- 
free the year around, to afford 
landing facilities for the ships. 

The first of these weird vessels. 
Flying Cloud, had been an experi- 
mental job designed to go a long 
way in a long time, but with a very 
low power consumption. The most 
important characteristic of anti- 
matter — apart from its terrifying 
explosive potential — is anti-mass. 
A ship with a sphere of contrater- 
rene iron incorporated in her struc- 
ture is weightless and inertialess. 
With her sails spread to the photon 
gale she can attain an extremely 
high percentage of the velocity of 
light but cannot, of course, exceed 
it. 

The crew of Flying Cloud had 
been, putting it mildly, a weird 
mob. Somehow they had become 
obsessed with the idea of turning 
the vessel into a real faster-than- 
light ship. (The conventional star- 
ship, proceeding under inertial 
drive and Mannschenn Drive, is not 
faster than light, strictly speaking; 
she makes light-years-iong voyages 



in mere weeks by, as it has been 
put, going ahead in space while 
going astern in time.) This desirable 
end they attempted to achieve by 
means of a jury-rigged rocket drive, 
using home-made solid fuel, just to 
give Flying Cloud that extra nudge. 

Fantastically, the idea worked, 
although it should not have. Not 
only did it work, but there were 
economically advantageous side 
effects. The lightjammer finished 
up a long way off course, plunging 
down to apparently inevitable 
destruction on Llanith, one of the 
planets of the anti-matter systems 
to the galactic west of the Rim 
Worlds. But a transposition of 
atomic charges had taken place. 
She now was anti-matter herself, 
whereas that contraterrene iron 
sphere was now normal matter. 

Flying Cloud had landed on 
Llanith and had been welcomed by 
the people, human rather than 
merely humanoid, of that world. 
She had remained on Llanith until 
the Llanithian scientists and 
engineers had worked out just what 
had happened and why. (The atti- 
tude of the scientists at first had 
been that it couldn’t possibly have 
happened.) Then, after modifica- 
tions had been made to her control 
systems and the makeshift rocket 
replaced by a properly designed 
reaction drive, she had returned to 
Lorn, carrying not only a sample 
shipment of trade goods but pas- 
sengers from the Llanithi Consor- 
tium.

GALAXY 



And Rim Runners, the shipping 
line of the Rim Worlds Con- 
federacy, had a new trade. 

G rimes sat in the forward 
cabin of the Rim Runners’ at- 
mosphere ferry that somebody had 
called — the name had stuck — the 
Commodore’s Barge. He was not 
handling the controls himself. His 
old friend and shipmate Billy Wil- 
liams, master of the deep-space tug 
Rim Malemute, was piloting. 
Grimes was admiring the scenery. 

The landscape unrolling beneath 
the barge was spectacular enough 
but cold and forbidding. Lake 
Misere was well astern now and the 
craft was threading its way over 
and through the Great Barrens, 
skirting the higher, jagged, snow- 
capped peaks, its inertial drive 
snarling as Williams fought to 
maintain altitude in the vicious 
downdrafts. The big man cursed 
softly to himself. 

Grimes said, “You would insist 
on coming along for the ride, 
Billy.’’ 

“I didn’t think you’d make me 
drive. Skipper.’’ 

“Rank has its privileges.” 

“No need to rub it in. If it’s all 
the same to you I’ll take this little 
bitch down through the Blackall 
Pass. It’s putting on distance, but I 
don’t feel like risking the Valley of 
the Winds after what we’ve been 
getting already.” 

“As you’ve been saying, you’re 
driving.” 



Williams brought the barge’s 
head around to port, making for the 
entrance to the pass. The opening 
was black in the dark gray of the 
cliff face, a mere slit that seemed to 
widen as the aircraft came on to the 
correct line of approach. And then 
they were plunging through the 
gloomy, winding canyon — the tor- 
tuosness of which was an effective 
wind baffle, although the eddies at 
every bend made pilotage difficult. 
The echoes of the irregular beat of 
the inertial drive, bouncing back 
from the sheer granite walls, in- 
hibited conversation. 

They broke out at last into what 
passed for daylight in these high lat- 
itudes, under a sky which, on this 
side of the ranges, was thickly over- 
cast. Only to the northwest, just 
above the featureless horizon of the 
Nullarbor Plain, was there a break 
in the cloud cover, a smear of sullen 
crimson to mark the setting of the 
Lorn sun. 

They flew steadily over the deso- 
late tundra through the gathering 
darkness. The lights of Port 
Erikson came up at last, bright but 
cheerless. Beyond them Grimes 
could see the tiny moving sparks of 
white and red and green that must 
be the navigation lanterns of the 
small icebreaker that, in winter, 
was employed to keep Coldharbor 
Bay clear of floes and pack ice. 

“Too bloody much seamanship 
about this job. Skipper,” remarked 
Williams cheerfully. 

“No such thing as too much sea-

manship,” retorted Grimes huffily. 
He pulled the microphone of the 
VHF transceiver from its clip. “As- 
tronautical Superintendant to Port 
Erikson. Can you read me? Over.” 
“Loud and clear, Commodore. 
Loud and clear. Pass your message. 
Over.” 

“My ETA Port Erikson is ten 
minutes from now. Over.” 

“We’re all ready and waiting for 
you, Commodore.” 

“What’s the latest on Pamir?" 
“ETA confirmed a few minutes 
ago. 2000 hours our time.” 

“Thank you. Port Erikson. Over 
and out.” 

Ahead was the scarlet blinker 
that marked the end of the airstrip. 
Williams maintained speed until 
the flashing light was almost di- 
rectly beneath the barge, until it 
looked as though they must crash 
into the spaceport’s control tower. 
With only seconds to spare he 
brought the aircraft to a shuddering 
halt by application of full reverse 
thrust, let her fall, checked her 
descent a moment before she hit the 
concrete. 

Grimes decided to say nothing. 
After all, he himself was frequently 
guilty of such exhibitions and all his 
life he had deplored the all-too- 
common Don't do as I do, do as I 
say, philosophy. 

G rimes and wnuams waited 
’ in the control tower with Cap- 
tain Rowse, the harbormaster. (In a 
normal spaceport his official title 



would have been port captain, but a 
normal spaceport does not run to a 
harbor, complete with wharfage 
and breakwaters.) 

“She’s showing up now,” an- 
nounced the radar operator. 

“Thank you, Mr. Gorbels,” said 
Rowse. 

The VHF speaker came to life. 
"Pamir to Port Erikson, Pamir to 
Port Erikson. Am coming in. 
Over.” 

Grimes recognized the voice, of 
course. Listowel had been master of 
the experimental Flying Cloud and 
was now in command of Pamir. A 
good man, not easily panicked, one 
who would have been just as at 
home on the poop of a windjammer 
as in the control room of a space- 
ship. 

The commodore moved so that 
he could look up through the trans- 
parent dome that roofed the control 
tower. Yes, there she was, her navi- 
gation lights bright sparks against 
the black overcast, white and ruby 
and emerald, masthead, port and 
starboard. (Her real masts were 
retracted, of course, and her sails 
furled. She was driving herself 
down through the atmosphere by 
negative dynamic lift, a dirigible 
airship rather than a spaceship.) 
Faintly Grimes could hear the 
throb of her airscrews, even above 
the thin whining of the wind that 
eddied about the tower. 

The ship was lower now, visible 
through the windows that over- 
looked Coldharbor Bay. Grimes

lifted borrowed night glasses to his 
^ eyes, ignoring the TV screen that 
r presented the infrared picture. The 
slim, graceful length of her was 
^ clearly visible, picked out by the 
line of lighted ports. Down she 
' ; came — down, down, slowly circling, 

j, until she was only meters above the 
t dark, white-flecked waters of the 
f bay. From her belly extended hoses. 
;|i and Grimes knew that the thirsty 
1*^ centrifugal pumps would be sucking 
^ in ballast. 

I "Pamir waterborne,” announced 
r Listowel from the VHF speaker. 

1 “Am proceeding to berth. Over.” 

Grimes, Williams and Rowse 
shrugged themselves into heavy 
overcoats, put on fur-lined caps. 
The harbormaster led the way to 
the elevator that would take them 
w, down to ground level. They dropped 
rapidly to the base of the tower. 
* Outside it was bitterly cold and the 
wind carried thin flurries of snow,

inent ears felt as though they were 
V going to snap off at any moment. 

But during berthing operations it 
i was essential to hear as well as to 
; see what was going on. 

The three men walked rapidly to 
the wharf, breasting the wind — 
little, fat Rowse in the lead, chunky 
' Grimes and big, burly Williams a 
couple of steps in the rear. The shed 
I lights were on now, as were the po- 
sition-marker flashers. Beside each 
of the latter waited three linesmen. 



beating their arms across their 
chests in an endeavor to keep 
warm. The berthing master, electric 
megaphone in his gloved hand, was 
striding up and down energetically. 

Pamir came in slowly and care- 
fully, almost hidden by the cloud of 
spray thrown up by the turbulence 
induced by her airscrews. She was 
accosting the wharf at a steep angle 
at first and then turned, so that she 
was parallel to the line of wharfage. 
The wind did the rest, so that it was 
hardly necessary for Listowel to use 
his line-throwers fore and aft. She 
fell gently alongside, with her off- 
shore screws swiveled to provide 
transverse thrust against the 
persistent pressure of the southerly. 

She lay there, a great, gleaming 
torpedo shape, gently astir as the 
slight chop rolled her against the 
quietly protesting fenders. The hum 
of motors, the threshing of 
airscrews, suddenly ceased. 

From an open window in his con- 
trol room Listowel called, “Is this 
where you want me?” 

“Make her fast as she is. Cap- 
tain,” called the berthing master. 

“As she is,” came the reply. 

A few seconds later a side door 
opened and the brow extended from 
the wharf, stanchions coming erect 
and manropes tautening. 

Grimes was first up the gangway. 
After all, as he had said to Sonya, 
the lightjammers were his babies. 

L istowel received the board- 
* ing party in his day cabin. 



THE DUTCHMAN 



123 



With him was Sandra Listowel, 
who was both his wife and his 
catering officer. Rim Runners did 
not, as a general rule, approve of 
wives traveling in their husband’s 
ships in any capacity, but Sandra 
was one of, the original Flying 
Cloud crew and had undergone 
training in that peculiar mixture of 
seamanship and airmanship re- 
quired for the efficient handling of 
a lightjammer. Grimes often won- 
dered if she had, over the years, be- 
come like so many of the wives of 
the old-time windjammer masters, 
a captain de facto — though he did 
not think that Ralph Listowel 
would allow such a situation to de- 
velop. 

Captain Listowel had changed 
little over the years. When he rose 
to greet his visitors he towered over 
them. He had put on no weight and 
his closely cut hair was still dark, 
save for a touch of gray at the tem- 
ples. And Sandra was as gorgeous 
as ever, a radiant blonde, not quite 
as slim as she had been but none the 
worse for that. Her severe, short- 
skirted, black uniform suited her. 

Listowel produced a bottle and 
glasses. He said, “You might like 
to try this. You look as though you 
need warming up. It’s something 
new. Our Llanithi friends acquired 
a taste for scotch and a local distil- 
ler thought he’d cash in on it. What 
he produced is not scotch. Even so, 
it’s good. It might go well on Lorn 
and the other Rim Worlds.’’ 

Grimes sipped the clear, golden 



fluid experimentally, then enthu- 
siastically. “Not bad at all.’’ Then: 
“You’d better have some more 
yourself to soften the blow, Lis- 
towel.’’ 

“What blow. Commodore?’’ 
“You’ve a very quick turn- 
around this time. As you know, 
Herzogen Cecile is tied up for re- 
pairs on Llanith — and I’d still like 
to know just how Captain Palmer 
got himself dismasted.’’ 

“I have his report with me. Com- 
modore.’’ 

“Good. I’ll read it later. And 
when Lord of The Isles comes in to 
Port Erikson she’s being withdrawn 
for survey. Which leaves you and 
Sea Witch to cope.’’ He grinned. 
“As they used to say back on Earth 
in the days of sail, ‘Growl you may, 
but go you must.’ ’’ 

“But we’re still in the days of sail. 
Commodore,’’ said Listowel. “And 
as one of the sailing ship poets said, 
‘All I ask is a tall ship and a star to 
steer her by.’ ’’ 

“Very touching, Ralph, very 
touching,’’ commented Sandra Lis- 
towel. “But I’m sure that the Chief 
Stewards of the ocean-going sailing 
ships had their problems, just as I 
have.’’ She turned to Grimes. “Last 
time we were in Port Erikson, 
Commodore, we enjoyed our usual 
two weeks alongside — but even 
then we sailed without all our 
stores. How will it be this time?’’ 
“Better,” promised Grimes. “I’ll 
light a fire under the tail of the Pro- 
vedore Department back at Port

Forlorn.” He allowed Listowel to 
fill his glass. “Did you have a good 
trip. Captain?” 

“Yes. Even so — ” 

“Even so what?” 

“I think you might keep us in- 
formed, sir, of these other lightjam- 
mers, the experimental ones, clut- 
tering up the route between Lorn 
and Llanith.” 

Grimes stared. “What are you 
talking about, Listowel?” 

“We averted collision by the 
thickness of a coat of paint. Cap- 
tain Palmer, in Herzogen Cecile, 
also had a close shave. His emer- 
gency alteration of course was so 
violent that it carried away his N 
and E masts with all their sails. He 
limped to Port Listowel on Llanith 
on S and W only.” 

“Why didn’t he report it? The cir- 
cumstances, 1 mean.” 

“He must have read your last cir- 
cular, Commodore.” 

Grimes’ prominent ears burned 
as he flushed angrily. But Listowel 
was right. He, Grimes, had written 
that circular under pressure from 
the Rim Worlds Admiralty — which 
body was, as he had put it, passing 
through a phase of acting like small 
boys playing at pirates. The fleet 
was out — or had been out or would 
be out — on deep space maneuvers. 
Masters and officers were reminded 
that the Carlotti bands were con- 
tinually monitored by potentially 
hostile powers. Therefore no report 
of any sighting of Rim Worlds 
Navy warships was to be made over 



these channels, whatever the cir- 
cumstances. And so forth. 

“We are the only people with the 
Erikson-Charge- Reversing Drive,” 
went on Listowel. “So we assumed 
that what we saw was an experi- 
mental warship. One of ours. 
Palmer assumed likewise.” 

Grimes made a major production 
of filling and lighting his pipe. He 
said through the swirling cloud of 
acrid blue smoke, “The Navy 
doesn’t have any lightjammers, yet. 
They want some, just in case we 
ever fail to see eye to eye with the 
Llanithi Consortium. But the first 
ships of the line, as they are to be 
called, are still on the drawing 
board.” 

Listowel murmured thoughtfully, 
“Nevertheless we saw something — 
and it as near as dammit hit us. 
What was it. Commodore?” 

“You tell me,” said Grimes. “I’m 
listening.” 

II 

I lSTOWEL was saying, “We 
^ were bowling along under a 
full press of sail and the Doppler 
Log was reading point eight nine 
seven, so it was nowhere near time 
to light the fire under our arse — ” 
He coughed apologetically. “That, 
sir, is the expression we use for 
starting the reaction drive — ” 

“1 gathered as much,” said 
Grimes. “But go on.” 

“We were just finishing dinner in 
the main salon. I had Llawissen and

his two wives — he’s the new Lla- 
nithi trade commissioner, as you 
know — at my table. We were 
making the usual small talk when I 
noticed that the little red warning 
light in the chandelier had come 
on. • 

“Sounds very fancy,” com- 
mented Williams. 

“You should have done more 
time in passenger ships, Billy,” 
Grimes told him. “That signal is to 
tell the master that he’s wanted in 
control, but for something short of 
a full-scale emergency. Carry on. 
Captain.” 

“So 1 excused myself, but didn’t 
leave the table in a hurry. Still, I 
lost no time in getting to the control 
room. Young Wallasey, the third 
mate, was 0.0. W. He said, ‘We’ve 
got company, sir.’ 1 said, ‘Impos- 
sible.’ He pointed and said, ‘Look.’ 

So I looked. 

“We had company all right. She 
was out on the starboard beam, just 
clear of E topmast. She was only a 
light at first, a blueish glimmer, a 
star where we knew damn welt no 
star should be, could be, hanging 
just above the distant mistiness of 
the Lens. 

“ ‘Anything on the radar?’ I 
asked. 

“There wasn’t — and these ships 
aren’t fitted with Mass Proximity 
Indicators.” 

“No need for them,” grunted 
Grimes, “unless you have Mann- 
chenn Drive.” 

“So — there was nothing on the 



radar, which is what made me think 
afterward that this vessel must have 
been an experimental warship. The 
light was getting brighter and 
brighter, suggesting that the ship — 

I had already decided that it must 
be a ship — was getting closer. 

“1 got the big mounted binocu- 
lars trained on it. After I got them 
focused I could make out details, 
although that fuzzy, greenish light 
didn’t help any. Some sort of force 
field? But no matter. I’d say that 
it — she — wasn’t as big as Pamir or 
any of the other commercial light- 
jammers. She had an odd sort of 
rig, too. Instead of having four 
masts arranged in a cruciform pat- 
tern she had three, in series. And 
the sails — what I could see of 
them — had reflective surfaces on 
both sides instead of on one side 
only, as is the case with ours. 

“And she was getting too bloody 
close on a convergent course. That 
was obvious, radar or no radar. 
Wallasey was calling her, first on 
the Carlotti set and then on NST, 
but getting no reply. There wasn’t 
time to break out the Morse lamp. 
Whoever dreamed that we’d need it 
in deep space? 

“So I said to hell with this and al- 
tered course, turning my W sails 
edge on to the Llanith sun. It was 
only just in time. That bastard was 
so near that I could see a line of 
ports with what looked like the 
muzzles of weapons sticking out of 
them. If she’d opened fire I 
wouldn’t be here to tell the tale.” 



126 



GALAXY 



“Nor would any of us,” com- 
mented Sandra Listowel. 

“And only you and the officer of 
the watch saw this — thing?” asked 
Grimes. 

“I’m not in the habit of throwing 
tea parties in my control room 
during emergencies, Commodore.” 
“Sorry. And presumably Captain 
Palmer saw something similar?” 
“He did.” 

“But finish your story. Captain. 
What happened next?” 

“Nothing. As I’ve told you, I al- 
tered course. And when next I was 
able to snatch a glance out of the 
ports she was gone. Like a snuffed 
candle, Wallasey told me.” 

Grimes grunted. He was thinking 
matters over. While he had dis- 
covered the anti-matter systems to 
the Galactic West he had never 
visited their worlds. And he had 
never sailed in the lightjammers — 
though these ships were his brain 
children. He could afford the time 
for a voyage to Llanith — although 
his best policy would be to make all 
arrangements for the conduct of af- 
fairs during his absence first and to 
inform Rim Runners’ management 
afterward. 

Not that this last mattered really. 
The Rim Worlds Navy would be 
interested in this story of alien light- 
jammers on the Lorn-Llanith trade 
route — and Grimes, as a Commo- 
dore of the Naval Reserve, had 
often in the past been called back to 
active duty to investigate strange 
occurrences. He had been called the 



Confederacy’s odd-job man for rea- 
sons. And Sonya would be in this 
too — she still held her commission 
in the Intelligence Branch of the 
Federation Survey Service. 

Grimes said to Rowse, “I’d like 
to ^orrow your office. Captain. I’ve 
a pile of telephoning to do. Oh, 
Captain Listowel, would you mind 
having accommodation ready for 
Mrs. Grimes and myself? We shall 
be making the next round trip with 
you.” 

“And what about me. Skipper?” 
asked Williams plaintively. 

“I’m sorry. Bill, but there just 
aren’t any senior masters kicking 
around loose at the moment. So, as 
of right now, you’re appointed 
Port Forlorn astronautical superin- 
tendent, acting, temporary.” 

“Not unpaid?” demanded the big 
man. 

“Not unpaid,” agreed Grimes. 

Williams’ manner brightened. 

G rimes called Admiral 

Kravitz first. The Officer 
Commanding Rim Worlds Navy 
was not pleased at being awakened 
from a sound sleep, but after he had 
listened to Grimes’ story he was 
alert and businesslike. He glowered 
at Grimes from the telephone 
screen. “These reports. They’re ut- 
terly fantastic. Can you trust these 
masters of yours? Couldn’t they 
have been seeing things?” 

“They saw something,” said 
Grimes. “In the case of Pamir, the 
intruder was seen by Captain Lis- 



THE DUTCHMAN 



127 



towel and his third officer, Mr. 
Wallasey. In the case of Herzogen 
Cecile. the chief and second officers 
were in the control room as well as 
Captain Palmer. All the stories 
tally, even to minor details.” 

“Is there any — ah — excessive 
drinking aboard your ships? Any 
addiction to hallucinogenic drugs?” 
“No.” Grimes’ ears were red- 
dening. He countered with: “Are 
you sure that the Navy hasn’t any 
experimental lightjammers?” 

“You know bloody well we 
haven’t. Grimes. Oh, all right, all 
right. Have your free trip at the tax- 
payers’ expense. Don’t forget to 
send the bill for your fare in to the 
Rim Worlds Navy.” 

“And my commodore’s pay and 
allowances, sir?” 

“Take that up with the accounts 
department. Grimes. You know 
how to look after yourself. Call me 
again at a civilized hour tomorrow 
morning after you’ve got things 
organized.” 

“Good night.” 

Grimes allowed himself a small 
grin. He was in an if-l’m-up-every- 
body’s-up mood. He called Sonya. 
She, too, exhibited extreme displea- 
sure at being disturbed at, as she 
put it, a jesusless hour. But her dis- 
pleasure was replaced by enthu- 
siasm. By the time the call was con- 
cluded she had decided what she 
would pack for herself and for 
Grimes and assured him that she 
would be at Port Erikson within 
twenty-four hours. 



There was another call Grimes 
would have liked to have made, but 
unluckily Ken Mayhew, one of the 
few remaining psionic communica- 
tion officers in the Rim Worlds, 
was not on Lorn. He was spending 
a long holiday on Francisco, of 
which planet his wife was a native. 
A good PCO, Grimes often said, 
was worth his weight in Carlotti 
transceivers — but not all PCOs 
were good and in the vast majority 
of interstellar ships the tempera- 
mental telepaths had been replaced 
by the time-space twisting Carlotti 
radio equipment. But a Carlotti 
transceiver could not read minds, 
was incapable of that practice, 
frowned upon by the Rhine Insti- 
tute but exercised nonetheless and 
known variously as snooping and 
prying. If Pamir had carried a 
psionic radio officer much could 
have been learned about the strange 
lightjammer. As it was, nothing — 
apart from the details of her ap- 
pearance — was known. 

Grimes went to the guest 
bedroom that had been provided 
for him in the Port Erikson staff 
accommodation block and settled 
down to read the reports — Lis- 
towel’s as well as Palmer’s. He 
would have liked to have discussed 
them with Rowse and Williams, but 
the port captain was organizing the 
round-the-clock stevedoring ac- 
tivities and Williams, who loved 
ships, was no doubt making a nui- 
sance of himself to Pamirs officers. 

The reports told Grimes little 



128 



GALAXY 



more than he had already learned 
from Captain Listowel’s spoken ac- 
count. 

G rimes and Sonya were guests 
in Pamir's control room when 
she sailed from Port Erikson at 
local noon, three day’s later. The 
southerly had persisted, had fresh- 
ened and was holding the ship 
against the wharf. The pivoting 
airscrews would be hard put to it to 
provide sufficient transverse thrust 
to pull her out bodily from the 
berth. But the little icebreaker was 
also a tug and was given a forward 
towline by Pamir. 

Mooring lines were let go fore 
and aft, were swiftly winched in- 
board. The pivoted offshore 
airscrews began to spin faster and 
faster, their whirling blades 
flickering into invisibility — but they 
were doing little more than holding 
the ship against the wind. 

“Take her out. Bustler.” ordered 
Listowel into his VHP microphone. 

“Take her out. Captain,” came 
the cheerful acknowledgment. 

The towline grew taut, scattering 
a glittering spray in the thin sun- 
light. Bustler’s diesels thumped 
noisily and black smoke shot from 
her squat funnel to be shredded by 
the stiff breeze. Grimes went to an 
open window on the port side of the 
control room, looked out and 
down. There was a gap now be- 
tween the wharf fenders and the 
side of the ship forward, a gap that 
was slowly widening. But what was 



happening aft? What about the pro- 
jecting venturi of the reaction drive, 
the after control surfaces? Wasn’t 
there a possibility — a probability — 
of their fouling the wharf gantries? 
But Listowel, standing in the mid- 
dle of his control room, didn’t seem 
to be worrying about it. And, after 
all, the ship was his. 

The stern was coming off, too, 
under the tug of the airscrews, al- 
though not so rapidly. There was 
clearance between the tail fins and 
the nearest wharf structure — not 
much, but enough. And then the 
port propellers, unpivoted, whirled 
into motion, giving headway and 
accentuating the swinging moment. 
Pamir turned to starboard slowly 
but determinedly, a white and green 
Jumble of brash ice piling up along 
that side. She came around into the 
wind and the starboard screws 
pivoted as she turned, giving 
headway instead of lateral thrust. 

Astern the distance between ship 
and wharf was widening rapidly. 

“Let go. Bustler,” ordered Lis- 
towel and then, to Grimes: “I’m al- 
ways afraid that one day I’ll forget 
and drag that poor little bitch with 
me all the way to Llanith.” 

“Is there any market there for 
used tugs or icebreakers?” 

“Button her up, Mr. Wallasey,” 
said Listowel. 

The third officer pressed buttons. 
The wheelhouse windows slid shut. 

And about time. Grimes thought. 
Icy drafts had begun to eddy about 
the compartment. 



THE DUTCHMAN

“Dump ballast.” 

The ship lifted as the tons of 
water gushed out from her tanks, 
rising faster and faster, stemming 
the wind, until Coldharbor Bay, di- 
rectly beneath her, seemed a puddle 
beside whiclva child had set a hud- 
dle of toy buildings — until far to the 
south the Ice Barrier, a coldly 
gleaming wall of pearly white, lifted 
over the black sea horizon. 

She lifted like a rocket, but 
without noise and without crushing 
acceleration effects. She soared 
into the clear sky, the color of 
which deepened from blue to 
purple, to black. Below her the 
planet was no longer a vast, spread- 
out map — it was a globe, with seas 
and continents half glimpsed 
through the swirling cloud forma- 
tions, with the dark shadow of the 
terminator drifting slowly across it 
from the west. 

The chief officer came into the 
control room to report all secured 
for space. Other reports came over 
the intercom. Listowel ac- 
knowledged them and then, 
smiling, turned to his guests. “Well, 
Commodore and Mrs. Grimes, how 
do you like it so far?” 

“I envy you, Listowel. You’ve a 
fine ship and you know how to 
handle her.” 

“Thank you. Commodore.” He 
said to the third officer, “Make the 
usual warning, Mr. Wallasey.” 
Then, to Grimes: “Seats and seat 
belts, sir. 1 have to swing her to the 
right heading now.” 



The maneuver was routine 
enough in any interstellar ship, the 
turning of a vessel about her axes 
until she was lined up with the 
target star. Somewhere amidships 
the big, directional gyroscopes 
grumbled, hummed and then 
whined, and centrifugal force gave 
the illusion of off-center gravity. 
The great globe that was Lorn 
seemed to fall away and to one side, 
and its sun drifted aft. Ahead now 
was only the blackness of interga- 
lactic space, although the misty 
Lens was swimming slowly into 
view through the side ports. Then, 
coming gradually toward the center 
of the cartwheel sights, appeared 
the distant cluster of bright sparks 
that were the anti-matter stars. The 
gyroscopes slowed almost to a stop, 
grumbling, as Captain Listowel 
made the last fine adjustments. 
They halted at last. 

The master looked up from his 
sighting telescope, murmured, 
“She’ll do.” Both hands went to 
the console before him. He said, 
“Look out through the side ports 
and aft. Commodore. This is worth 
watching.” 

It was. 

From the control room — which, 
like the bridge of a sea-going ship 
or the conning tower of a sub- 
marine, was a superstructure — 
there was a good view astern. 
Grimes could see the engine pods, 
four to a side, their now motionless 
four-bladed airscrews gleaming in 
the harsh sunlight. He could see the 



130 



GALAXY 



stubs of three of the masts — W to 
port, N on the centerline and E to 
starboard. S, of course, was be- 
neath the hull and not visible, ex- 
cept in the periscope screen. But 
those stubs were stubs no longer. 
They were elongating, extending, 
stretching like impossibly fast 
growing, straight-stemmed trees. 
And as they grew they sprouted 
branches, foliage — the yards and 
the sails. The royals at the head of 
each mast were fully spread before 
the process of telescopic elongation 
was completed. 

There was disorientation then, vi- 
sual confusion, upset balance as the 
star wind filled the sails. What had 
been up was up no longer. Aft was 
still aft, but it was also “down.” 
Chairs swung in their gymbals, as 
did some of the instruments. Other 
equipment was cunningly designed 
so that it could be used from almost 
any angle. 

Grimes realized what was hap- 
pening but, twisting his body awk- 
wardly in the chair, still stared in 
fascination aft and down through 
the polarized glass of the viewports. 
He had seen the sail plan of this 
ship, of course, had helped to 
draw it up; but this was the first 
time he had watched a lightjammer 
actually making sail. He mentally 
recited the names of the courses. 
He had insisted the old nomen- 
clature be used. Northsail, lower 
topsail, upper topsail, topgallant, 
royal. 

He turned away at last, asked. 



“Do you usually make sail all in 
one operation. Captain?” 

Listowel laughed. “Only when 1 
have guests in the control room.” 
Sonya laughed, too. “John would 
prefer to see all hands out in space- 
suits, clambering in the rigging like 
monkeys.” 

“The good old days, eh?” Lis- 
towel unsnapped his seat belt. 
“Roll and go. Hell or Llanith in 
ninety days — and the sun’s over the 
yardarm.” 

Grimes took one last look at that 
splendid suit of sails, black against 
the glare of the Lorn sun, before he 
got up to follow Listowel and 
Sonya from the control room. He 
realized that he would have to get 
his spacelegs back. In this inertia- 
less ship, in spite of the already fan- 
tastic acceleration, the distinction 
between up and down was a matter 
of faith rather than of knowledge. 



T hey enjoyed their drinks — 
more of the Llanithian 
whisky — in Listowel’s comfortable 
day room, where Sandra joined 
them. 

“How are the customers?” her 
husband asked her. 

“There’s only one this trip,” she 
told him. She flashed a smile at the 
guests. “I don’t count the commo- 
dore and Mrs. Grimes as real pas- 
sengers.” 

“Who is it?” asked Grimes. 
“Anybody I know — or should 
know?” 



THE DUTCHMAN 



131 



“Perhaps you should know her, 
sir. She’s a missionary.” 

“Why wasn’t I warned?” de- 
manded Listowel. 

“I’m warning you now, Ralph.” 
“What’s her name? What nut cult 
is she trying fo peddle?” 

“She’s the Reverend Madam 
Swithin. Rather an old dear, ac- 
tually. She’s a missionary for the 
United Primitive Spiritualist 
Church.” 

“And she thinks she’ll be able to 
convert the Llanithi?” 

“She’ll probably convert some of 
them. After all, given the right con- 
ditions you can convert anybody to 
anything.” 

“But United Primitive Spiri- 
tualism — ” muttered Listowel 

disgustedly. 

“They have something,” Sonya 
told him. “I’ve had some odd ex- 
periences and so has John.” 

“I only hope she’s not at my 
table,” said the master. 

“Where else could I put her, 
Ralph? After all, she is a person of 
some importance in her church. 1 
couldn’t put her with the junior offi- 
cers.” 

“I’m sorry about this. Commo- 
dore,” Listowel said. 

“Don’t worry. Captain. We’ll 
survive somehow,” Grimes told 
him. 

T he Reverend Madam Swithin 
was, as Sandra had said, rather 
an old dear, but the sort of old dear 
whose idea of conversation is 



asking endless questions. Yet it 
could be said in her favor that she 
enjoyed the excellent food prepared 
by Sandra and served by the effi- 
cient stewardess and that she did 
not belong to one of those sects that 
regard alcoholic beverages as 
sinful. It took her some little time 
to get things sorted out, however. 
She knew that a commodore is su- 
perior to a captain and so assumed 
that Grimes was master of Pamir. 
She asked him why he wasn’t 
wearing uniform. Then she asked 
why Pamir wasn’t named according 
the general Rim Runners principle, 
with the “Rim” prefix. 

Grimes told her, “In these vessels 
we’ve tried to revive the names of 
the old sailing ships, the Terran 
windjammers. Unluckily most, if 
not all, of the most famous names 
are being used by Trans-Galactic 
Clippers — Thermopylae and Cutty 
Sark and so on.” 

“Are Trans-Galactic Clippers 
lightjammers like this one. Com- 
modore?” 

“No, Madam Swithin. But the 
original clippers were very fast 
sailing ships and long after sail had 
vanished from the seas the name 
‘clipper’ was still being used by the 
operators of other forms of trans- 
port — road services, airlines and so 
forth. One of the first little ships to 
fly to Earth’s moon was called 
Yankee Clipper." 

“How interesting. Commodore. 
The usage gives one a sense of con- 
tinuity, don’t you think? And now. 



132 



GALAXY 



Captain, when do you think you’re 
getting this clipper of yours to 
Llanith?” 

“ETA is just three weeks sub- 
jective from now.” 

“You said 'Hell or Llanith in 
ninety days’,” Sonya reminded 
him. 

“Ninety days objective,” He told 
her. “But only three weeks as we 
shall live them, Mrs. Grimes.” 

“And is there really any danger 
of the ship’s getting wrecked? Not 
that I’m frightened, of course. I 
know that there is no death.” 
Sandra joined them at the table, 
bringing coffee. “Don’t worry. 
Madam Swithin. That ‘Hell or 
Llanith’ is just an expression that 
Captain Listowel picked up from a 
book about the famous windjam- 
mers. There was a captain on the 
trade between England and Aus- 
tralia who used to say, 'Hell or 
Melbourne in ninety days!’ ” 

“And as / was saying, dear, such 
a sense of continuity. So fascinating 
to think that you sailing ship cap- 
tains are reincarnations of the old 
sailing ship captains. The wheel has 
come full circle and you have been 
reborn--” 

Listowel was beginning to squirm 
uncomfortably in his chair. The 
junior officers at their tables — ob- 
viously listening — were starting to 
look amused. Grimes endeavoured 
to steer the conversation on to a 
fresh tack. 

“And when. Captain,” he asked, 
“do you start the reaction drive?”

“A week from now. Commodore, 
as soon as we have point nine recur- 
ring on the Doppler Log. Then we 
have a week of full acceleration and 
FTL flight. Then we have to decel- 
erate. And then, all being well, 
we’re there.” 

All being well, thought Grimes. 
But if all is well, I shall have made 
this trip for nothing. 

HI 

S HE was a fine ship, this Pamir, 
and most efficiently run — but, 
to one accustomed to a conven- 
tional starship, uncannily quiet. 
Grimes missed the incessant, noisy, 
arhythmic hammering of the 
inertial drive, the continuous thin. 



THE DUTCHMAN 



133 



high keening of the Mannschenn 
Drive. Here the only mechanical 
noises were the occasional sobbing 
of a pump, the soft susurrus of the 
forced ventilation. 

On she drove, running free before 
the photon Jale. The Rim Stars 
astern were ruddily dim — the suns 
of the Llanithi Consortium blazed 
intensely blue ahead. And on the 
beam, mast and sails in black sil- 
houette against it, glowed the great 
Lens of the Galaxy, unaffected by 
either red or blue shift. 

The needle of the Doppler Log, 
after its initial rapid jump, crept 
slowly around its dial. Point eight, 
point eight five, point eight seven 
five. Grimes tried to imagine 
what the ship must look like to an 
outside observer, tried to visualize 
the compression along the fore and 
aft line. But to see her at all that 
mythical outside observer would 
have to be in another ship traveling 
in the same direction at the same 
speed — and then, of course, he 
would observe nothing abnormal. 

And what would happen if Pamir 
hit something — even only a small 
piece of cosmic debris — at this fan- 
tastic velocity? So far the lightjam- 
mers had been lucky — but what if 
their luck suddenly ran out? The 
question, as far as her crew was 
concerned, was purely academic. 
They would never know what hit 
them — although after weeks or 
months or years the brief flare 
would be visible in the night skies of 
Lorn and Llanith. 



At last came the time for the final 
acceleration — and the reversal of 
atomic charges. Again Grimes and 
Sonya were guests in the control 
room, watching with fascination. 
Listowel explained, “This isn’t half 
as bad as that moment when the 
temporal precession field of the 
Mannschenn Drive is initiated. Oh, 
you’ll feel something. We all do. 
Just a microsecond of tension and, 
at the same time — as the charges 
are reversed — what we call a 
scrambled spectrum. But there’s 
none of the dithering about in and 
on alternate time tracks that we ex- 
perienced when we first discovered 
the effect.’’ 

“Just as well,’’ grunted Grimes. 
“Alternate time tracks are among 
my pet allergies.’’ 

Listowel was watching the log 
screen, which gave him far finer 
readings than the dial, to six places 
of decimals. Grimes and Sonya 
watched, too. 

999993. The crimson numerals 
glowed brightly. 999994. 999995. 

. The 6 was a long time coming up. 
. Ah, here it was. 999997. 
999998. There was another long 
delay. Then the final 9 appeared 
briefly but flickered back to 8. 

“Go, you bitch, go,” Listowel 
was whispering. 

999999. 

“It’s holding, sir,” whispered one 
of the officers. 

“1 have to be sure. Now!” 

After the long days of quiet 
sailing the screaming roar of the 



134 



GALAXY 



f rocket drive, carried by and 
through the metal structure of the 
I ship, was startlingly loud. There 
* should have been brutal accelera- 
tion, but there was not. There was 
not physical sense of accelera- 
tion. Yet Grimes felt as though 
he, personally, were striving to lift 
some impossibly heavy weight. He 
felt as though he were pressing 
against some thin yet enormously 
tough film that stubbornly refused 
to break. 

' Then it burst. 

There was real acceleration now, 
driving him down into the padding 
, of his chair. He was dimly aware 
i that Listowel — a strange Listowel, 
who looked like a photographic 
negative, whose shorts-and-shirt 
uniform was black instead of the 
' regulation white, whose face had 
become oddly negroid — was doing 
things, explaining as his hands 
moved over the console. His voice, 
' normally light, was a deep, grum- 
^ bling bass. “Have to pivot the sails. 
Commodore. Edge on, or we’ll be 
I taken aback — ’’ 

Suddenly things snapped back to 
normal. 

i Color and sound were as they 
y should be and the acceleration had 
!. eased to a fairly comfortable one 
' gravity. Grimes took mental stock 
of himself. Yes, he was still Com- 
modore John Grimes of the Rim 
Worlds Naval Reserve, astro- 
nautical superintendent of Rim 
Runners. And he was still aboard 
Pamir. He turned to look at his 



wife, who smiled back at him rather 
shakily. And Sonya was still Sonya. 

So far so good. 

And the log screen? 

Blue numerals now — 1.000459. 
1.000460. The final I flashed up 
and then, in steady succession: 2, 
3,4, 5... 

All my years in deep space, 
thought Grimes, and this is the first 
time I’ve really traveled faster than 
light. 

<< CO 'VE are all anti-matter 
O now. Captain?” asked the 
Reverend Madam Swithin that 
evening at dinner. She did not wait 
for a reply, but went on, “But what 
about our souls, our essential es- 
sences?” 

“I’m afraid, madam, that that’s 
rather outside my province,” re- 
plied Listowel. 

“And what do you think. Com- 
modore?” 

Grimes grunted through a 
mouthful of steak. 

“But the Llanithi have souls,” 
the missionary went on. “Otherwise 
I should not be traveling to their 
worlds.” 

A rather uncomfortable silence 
was broken by Sonya. “Tell me. 
Madam Swithin — do you ever, in 
your seances, establish communica- 
tion with the departed spirits of 
non-human entities?” 

“Frequently, Mrs. Grimes. One 
of our mediums has as her control a 
Shaara princess, who last enjoyed 
material existence five hundred

standard years ago. And recently, 
during a service in our church in 
Port Farewell, a spirit spoke 
through the officiating medium and 
said he was — that he had been, 
rather — a people’s marshal on 
Llanith. What is a people’s mar- 
shal, Captain?” 

“It’s roughly equivalent to a po- 
lice commissioner on our worlds, 
madam,” replied Listowel. 

Sonya sipped from her wine 
glass, then asked, “One thing has 
always rather puzzled me. Madam 
Swithin. One of the doctrines of 
your church is reincarnation. How 
does that fit in with that large 
number of disembodied spirits 
who are always present at your 
seances to say their pieces?” 

The motherly little woman 
smiled sweetly at Sonya. “There is 
reincarnation, as we believe — as we 
know — Mrs. Grimes. But the soul 
is not reincarnated into a new body 
immediately after its release from 
the old one. In the case of ordinary 
people the delay is not a long one. It 
is the extraordinary people, the out- 
standing personalities, who often 
have to wait for centuries, or until a 
suitable vehicle for their rare psy- 
ches has become available — ” 

“In other words,” said Grimes, 
who was becoming interested, 
“until the genes and chromosomes 
have been suitably shuffled and 
dealt.” 

“What a good way of putting it. 
Commodore. 1 must remember 
that.” She looked at Grimes as 



though she were viewing him as a 
potential and valuable convert — 
which. Grimes realized, he could 
be. Why can't I keep my big mouth 
shut? he asked himself. “You will 
agree. Commodore, that a special 
sort of character is required for the 
captain of a ship?” 

Grimes made a noncommittal 
sound. 

“And that an even more special 
kind of character is required for the 
captain of a sailing ship — ” 

“I did,” admitted Grimes cau- 
tiously, “bear certain qualities in 
mind when I appointed the masters 
and officers to these lightjam- 
mers — and not all of those I se- 
lected passed the rather rigorous 
training.” 

Listowel muttered something 
about bumbling around in blimps 
over the Great Barrens, but 
subsided when Grimes glared at 
him. 

“And how many lightjammers 
does your company operate. Com- 
modore?” 

“At the moment, four. Pamir, 
Herzogen Cecile, Lord of the Isles 
and Sea Witch. As the trade ex- 
pands we shall require more ton- 
nage, of course. Preussen and 
Garthpool are on the drawing 
boards. And the Rim Worlds Navy 
has the plans for at least three 
sailing warships.” 

“Four ships. And five more some 
time in the future. But what of the 
thousands of sailing captains who 
must have lived in the days when 



136 



GALAXY 



r their vessels were the only long-dis- 
r tance transport on Earth? Many of 
those souls must still be waiting for 
i reincarnation.” 

j “One of my ancestors might be 

[ among them,” said Grimes. 

“Really, Commodore?” 

“Yes. He was a Barbary 
I Corsair — but before that he was 

master of an English ship in the 
Mediterranean trade. A forced 
convert to Islam who decided to 
play along and do as well for him- 
self as possible — ” 

“Are you sure that he was never 
reincarnated, John?” asked Sonya. 
“Some of the less savory episodes 
in your past haven’t been far short 
of piracy.” 

“I might be able to find out for 
you. Commodore,” said Madam 
■ Swithin eagerly. “1 am more of an 
administrator than a medium, but I 
do have powers — ” 

r “Thank you,” Grimes told her. 

i “But 1 think I’d rather not know.”

turned, trimming them so that the 
radiance from the Llanithi stars 
was striking their reflecting sur- 
faces at an oblique angle. Grimes, 
watching the Doppler Log screen, 
saw the numerals change from 
25.111111 to 25.111110, to 

25.111109.. 

All four lower courses were now 
exerting full braking effect and the 
lower topsails were trimmed, 
squared. 23.768212... 23.768000... 

23.759133.. Upper topsails next.

So far there was no sensation. 
The ship was inertialess, her struc- 
ture and crew protected from the 
forces that should have exploded 
them through the darkness and 
emptiness in a blazing flare of 
energy. 

1.492981.. 1.205288... 1.200438...

The logistic demands of the 
colonization process almost al- 
ways dictate a biased sex ratio 
in the colonizing population. In 
the Mormon hegira from Mis- 
souri to the valley of the Great 
Salt Lake in 1847, for example, 
Brigham Young led a band of 
143 men and three women. 
And two children. Other 
similar disbalances could be 
cited. The mission of colonists 
is first to survive, then to repro- 
duce. In the history of coloni- 
zation the men go first and the 
women come later, but the 
planners of the first step 
toward extraterrestrial coloni- 
zation recognized man’s need 
to introduce human biological 
components into his new pat- 
tern of survival. 

Boris Spector, 
The Tactics of Colonization 
Harper and Ivanovich, 2025 

P ^ICK this up as Pearl Harbor 
is preparing to leave Hiroshima. 
These are, perhaps, extraordinary 
names for components of a lunar 
mission and the responsibility for 
this nomenclature is lost in a 
Byzantine maze of international 
bureaucracy. There is a symbolism, 
no doubt, but no one is willing or 
able to say what it is. Be that as it 
may. Pearl Harbor is about to sepa- 
rate and enter landing orbit. After 
that Hiroshima will go back home. 



Nagasaki, her sister ship, will be 
along later. 

“Chris?” Leon Sokolov in Hiros- 
hima. 

“Roger, Lenny. All lights green 
here.” 

“Roger. Let’s keep it that way. 
You’re on automatic sequence in — 
fifty-eight seconds.” 

“Right.” 

“1 thought it might be well to give 
you a word of advice.” His voice 
spoke the words with a heavy but 
entirely understandable accent. 
When the explorers of space had 
made their first tentative steps 
toward international cooperation 
there had been a bit of talk about 
which language to use. English had 
won. 

“Advise ahead, old buddy.” 

“Just one word no, this will 
take more. We’re leaving you down 
there with three girls. And one of 
them is ours.” Chris Conway 
looked about and saw that this was 
so. Marya Popovich was on his 
right and across from them, facing 
them, were the now mildly amused 
persons of Teiko Satori and Julia 
Clark. They were belted in. Chris 
would fly Pearl Harbor down but, if 
necessary, any of the girls could do 
it as well. 

“That’s right, Lenny. But it’s too 
late to trade places. Sorry.” 

“Too late to trade places, right. 
So 1 say. Comrade Christopher 
Conway — not too much time left 
now — conduct yourself with honor 



139 



and probity, as would I, had 1 
drawn the lot instead of you. 1 am 
not, what you say, jealous.” Of 
course not, thought Chris, looking 
at the girls. “So — well, good luck, 
that’s all. Automatic sequence in 
ten seconds. Good trip, comrades.” 
Four vtjices mixed together in 
Sokolov’s phones. Then automatic 
sequence took over and they were 
detached and away to the flat sur- 
face of Mare Nectaris, near the ter- 
minator, to establish the first 
tentative, temporary colony on the 
moon. They were programed for a 
twenty-eight-day stay. 



T *HE landing was smooth. “I 
couldn’t have done better 
myself,” Julia said. 

These four had been relentlessly 
screened through a psycho- 
logical/psychiatric/emotional sieve 
that didn’t pass much. The scores of 
Chris and Sokolov had been so 
close that they had settled that one 
by yarrow stalks. The three girls 
were in a class by themselves, se- 
lected on the basis of parameters 
too numerous to mention. 

“I appreciate the compliment, 
Julia. Houston?” 

“Roger, Chris.” 

“To coin a phrase. Pearl Harbor 
has landed.” 

“Girls all right?” 

A trilingual babble answered in 
the affirmative. 

There had been too many jokes 
about this, of course, about what 
the first man to be cast upon the 



moon with three lovely girls would 
make of it. The design of the mis- 
sion had not called for the girls to 
be lovely, of course — they had been 
chosen on other bases. But these 
three had come up lovely. 

What the four of them were sup- 
posed to make of it was to live on 
the moon for four weeks and see 
how it went. What, if anything, 
went wrong. There had been many 
simulations on Earth — in air-raid 
shelters, abandoned mines and on 
the bottoms of the seas. And prob- 
lems, as they say, had arisen. These 
had been worked on (though not 
solved) and the time had come to 
try the real thing. 

Why three women and one man? 
The President of the United States 
was a woman, but that was not the 
reason. It was more that lASA (In- 
ternational Aeronautics and Space 
Administration) had become con- 
vinced of the intrinsic biological su- 
periority of the female — a conclu- 
sion based partly upon the history 
of man and partly upon the results 
of the Earth simulations. 

Their qualifications for this mis- 
sion? They are bright, but not too 
bright (average IQ, 146). They are 
emotionally stable, but not too 
stable. They have all seen each 
others’ profiles and one conse- 
quence of this is that Chris hopes to 
God that the three of them never 
get mad at him, for whatever cause, 
at the same time. And they are 
trained primarily in the behavioral 
sciences. Marya is a psychologist. 



140 



GALAXY 



Teiko is a sociologist and Julia is a 
psychiatrist. In addition all are 
sketchily familiar with astronomy, 
geology, nursing, anesthesia and 
photography. Surprisingly, they get 
on well together. 

Within the bodies of this crew are 
no vermiform appendices — these 
have been prophylacticaliy excised. 
The dentists have done all they can 
to ensure that no acute problems 
arise in that area — no tooth is going 
up there that might need to be ex- 
tracted in a hurry. None of the 
colonists has any dental training 
whatever. The girls’ pregnancy tests 
are negative. 

Back to psychology and the soli- 
tary male. He is also bright, but no 
genius. He is stable, but he is alive. 
And he is trained — he is a doctor of 
medicine. 

In short, a different kind of mis- 
sion. No geologists, no seismolo- 
gists, no archeologists. Just people. 
Except for Chris, behavioral 
people. They will study themselves, 
the first colony on the moon. The 
physical scientists have given them 
things to do and things to do with, 
but that isn’t the main idea. 

Oh, yes — the Commanding Of- 
ficer is Christopher Conway. This is 
not because he’s the only male — he 
drew the long yarrow stalk. 

AFTER a thorough on-board 
z\.checkout they suited up, 
cracked the hatch and lowered the 
ladder. Quite a few people had 
landed on the moon by now, but 



none of these four had. Though 
they had watched the action from 
Earth before, they found it was, in 
the event, some different kind of 
trip. And another lunar first — three 
women on the surface at the same 
time exceeded the previous record 
by two. 

They opened the hatch of the 
cargo compartment. 

“First things first,’’ said Chris. 
“It’s going to be a long night.’’ 

The amount of energy they could 
take to the moon was stringently 
limited and the first instruments to 
be deployed were solar accumula- 
tors. The landing site was near the 
terminator, where the lunar day 
had just begun, so they could store 
maximum solar energy before 
nightfall. It would, indeed, be a 
long night. And a cold one. The ac- 
cumulators were, logically, just in- 
side the hatch. 

“Okay, boss,’’ said Teiko. 
“Where you say we put these?” 
Chris’s intent was that his CO 
title be nominal. But someone had 
to take responsibility for decisions 
and on this mission he was it. He 
surveyed the immediate area. 

“About here. I’d say. We’ll put 
the dome over there — the surface is 
nice and smooth.” 

“About here. I’d say. We’ll put 
the dome over there — the surface is 
nice and smooth.” 

The accumulators were bulky 
and on Earth would have been a 
problem, but in the lunar gra\ity 
they made easy work. 



MAYFLOWER ONE 



141 



Next, the dome. This was of 
transparent mylarplex, a few mils 
thick. Transparent mylarplex. The 
colonists had been given their 
choice of anything from trans- 
parent through opaque. They had 
unanimously wanted transparent, 
thinking about lying there in the 
lunar dark, looking up at the stars. 

The dome folded into a small 
package, but when expanded (with 
an oxygen-nitrogen mixture) it was 
supposed to be big enough to house 
four people and everything they 
would need for four weeks. 

They carried the folded structure 
to the smooth place Chris had indi- 
cated and unfolded it. Chris carried 
over the first of a number of metal 
cylinders of the compressed gas 
mixture and attached it to the 
fitting. 

“God bless our home,” he said, 
cracking the valve. “Best you don’t 
leak.” They were prepared to patch 
it if it did. The dome filled well. It 
was flat on the botto’m, almost 
hemispherical on top, above three- 
foot side walls. The ceiling was ten 
feet above the floor at the apex. The 
diameter of the floor was twelve 
feet. 

There was an air lock, hermeti- 
cally zippered. They entered the ex- 
panded dome one at a time. They 
looked around. 

“It’s — cozy,” Julia said. 

“Nectaris Base — calling from 
Hiroshima. " 

“Roger, Lenny. It’s cozy down 
here. Sorry you couldn’t come.” 



“Yes. So am 1. Let us hope it will 
be cozy. 1 am, as you know, about 
to return to Earth.” 

“Good trip, Tovarisch," Marya 
said. 

“Yes, Tovarisch. So long. Sayo~ 
nara. " 

"Sayonara,” said Teiko. Her 
voice, soft and feminine, stood in 
some contrast to the others. Not 
that there was anything masculine 
about Marya or Julia. But there 
was something in Teiko’s voice. 

“See you back home,” Chris 
said. 

"Da. I’m just about over you 
now.” The four looked up through 
the transparent dome, knowing 
they would not be able to see Hiro- 
shima, but looking anyway. “1 see 
where you are,” Sokolov said, “but 
I can’t see you. Goodbye, now. 
Over and out. Dasvidanya.” 

“So long, Lenny. Dasvidanya. 
See you in about five weeks. We’ve 
work to do now. Nectaris Base 
out.” 

T 'HEY stood a few moments, 
looking at each other. The first 
people (except for Nora Ivanovna 
and Stuart Stong) to be left on the 
moon with no command module in 
orbit waiting to be flown up to. A 
sobering thought. They were pre- 
pared for it, but it was sobering 
none the less. 

“Come on,” Chris said. “We 
have work to do.” 

Chris, Julia and Marya went 
through the lock one at a time and 



142 



GALAXY 



began the demanding job of fer- 
rying survival gear, stores, staples 
and instruments through to Teiko. 
Unzip zipper, put gear in, zip up, 
unzip inside, remove gear, zip up. 
Carbon dioxide absorbers, lASA 
things to eat and drink, a chemical 
toilet (another lunar first, by God!), 
sleeping bags, books, a chess set 
(Chris had insisted on that) and 
other goodies to keep four people 
alive and well on alien turf for four 
weeks. 

They put everything on the check 
list into the dome. The remaining 
gear — instruments to deploy and so 
on — they would take care of later. 

Privacy. Something to be con- 
sidered — or not considered — on 
such a mission. It was possible to 
provide the dome with opaque par- 
titions. Thin and totally unsound- 
proof, but opaque. The decision 
here had not been given out of hand 
to the colonists — Mission Design 
wanted to have something to say 
about it — but the views of the colo- 
nists had been solicited. Teiko, 
Julia and Chris had thought that 
the concept of privacy didn’t have 
much relevance. What, after all, 
would there be to be private about 
on the moon after the time together 
in a cramped module getting there? 
After the weeks of simulation on 
Earth, where they had already tried 
it both ways? Marya’s view was 
that translucent partitions would be 
nice, but in the end Nectaris Base 
wound up with zero privacy, 
including the chemical toilet. 



Consensus had been that privacy 
there would have been dishonest 
and fraudulent, some kind of cheap 
cop-out three of them didn’t want. 
Let it be said that Marya, though 
not altogether of this opinion, went 
gracefully along with the majority. 

The sunlit night of the first day 
came soon enough. Four space suits 
hung upon a complex rack standing 
in the center of the floor of the \ 
dome. Temperature-control units 
were working fine. Time to sleep — 
and the need for it — but everything 
was as bright as when they had 
awakened — not that they had 
awakened in that place. 

Temperature control was on 
Heat. The sun was up, but not yet 
high. The outside temperature was 
just about freezing. As the sun rose 
it would get up to about 170° F. 
They were on Mare Nectaris, so the 
sun would never be directly 
overhead, where it would send the 
temperature to over 260°. On Nec- 
taris Base, as the sun rose the out- 
side temperature would at some 
point, though not for long, stand at 
a moderate seventy degrees. 

Tired — and into the sleeping 
bags. 

“It is cozy,’’ Julia said. All mikes 
were off. Barring emergencies there 
would be only brief contact with 
Houston, once a day. “Not at all 
like the simulations. It reminds me 
of being at camp as a kid.’’ 

“Some camp,” Chris said. 

“I think it looks — stark,” said 
Marya. 



MAYFLOWER ONE 



143 



“Yes.” Teiko. “But beautiful, 
Masha, no?” 

“Yes. Beautiful.” 

They had begun with their 
sleeping bags more or less at the 
four corners of the lunar compass. 
They shifted, because of the light, 
to put their heads all in a row in the 
shadow cast by the central rack. 
“Masha?” Chris asked. 

••Da?” 

"How about a game of chess 
tomorrow?” 

"Da. My pleasure. 1 beat you.” 
End of lunar day number one. No 
snoring — they had been screened 
for that too. 



II 

T hey awoke at about the same 
time, tossing and turning in the 
light gravity, then realizing where 
they were. 

“It’s funny,” Teiko said. “The 
sun is where it was when we went to 
sleep. Almost. And Earth too.” 
“Some kind of place to wake 
up,” Julia said. 

Chris examined her through a 
sleepy eye. “Let’s see now. Though 
woman’s place is no longer neces- 
sarily in the kitchen, I think I’ll 
have a large orange juice, two 
toasted English muffins and mar- 
malade, two scrambled eggs and 
four large cups of your very best 
mocha java, rich and aromatic, 
steaming as it is brought to table by 
comely girl, teeth asparkle, eyes 



agleam, eager to serve, to please, to 
make happy.” 

“Dream on, Massah. Masha, re- 
mind us both to make a note of this 
when we get up. One day into the 
mission — and incipient delusions of 
grandeur.” 

Chris grinned, stretched, 
squirmed out of the bag and used 
the toilet. Colonists would do what 
they could in their colony to retain 
memories of home. Thus these at- 
tires: Chris wore a T-shirt; Teiko 
wore nothing; Marya wore yellow 
pajamas; Julia wore a blue flannel 
nightgown. Julia was from New 
Hampshire. 

And the Lunar Hilton began to 
stir. 

Scrambled eggs? Well, no, but 
the rations weren’t that bad, not 
really, not yet. So, as they would 
have on Earth, they had breakfast 
and addressed themselves to the 
problems of the day. 

This was the first space mission 
to be reasonably unstructured. This 
fluidity was dictated by its unique 
goals. Work was provided, but it 
could be done in the colonist’s time, 
not Houston’s. The physical 
scientists had provided instruments 
and instructions about what to do 
with them. The concept of work 
was (this should be obvious) es- 
sential. These pioneers wouldn’t 
have to fell trees or clear the jungle, 
but others would, later, on other 
planets in other systems. lASA was 
looking ahead. So they had work to 
do — it was all written in a big 



144 



GALAXY 



book — and they were supposed to 
get it done, but it was up to them to 
structure their own time. 

They finished breakfast. They 
had, in the dome, four folding 
chairs and two folding tables. They 
had no toasted English muffins. 
Chris glanced at the book that said 
what they were supposed to do, but 
he didn’t open it. They didn’t have 
to do any of it today. 

“All right,’’ he said. “I am the 
commanding officer of this, our 
Nectaris Base colony on the moon. 
I decree, therefore, that our first 
day be spent in R&R.” Chris 
looked with some seriousness at the 
girls. “You behaviorists will no 
doubt be watching what we all do. 
Fine. We’ll all do what we want to. 
I’ll be taking a walk outside, 
picking up a few rocks. We won’t 
deploy any instruments today, at 
least I won’t. We’ll call Houston in 
a couple of hours and give them our 
opinion of their breakfast.’’ 

“No kushikatsu," Teiko said. 
“For breakfast?’’ She shrugged 
her slender shoulders. 

“No vodka.” And Marya 
shrugged her sturdier shoulders. 
“No scrambled eggs.” 

“All right. So. Suit up. Walk 
around a bit outside, write post- 
cards, take pictures. lASA wants 
all we can take, of course. Read, 
brood. Whatever. Each to his own. 
Her own. And as for you, Masha, 
pawn to King Four.” 

“So. Who says you have the first 
move, Tovarisch?" Her glance was 



an enigma. “We draw for this, 
right?” 

The beginning of their second day 
on the moon. 

By evening of that first day 
we had decided to arrange the 
sleeping bags in a rotation. 
Not, as Masha pointed out, 
that we had any vision of 
taking turns being on Chris’s 
right hand. We had come very 
simply and without really 
saying it to the thought that in 
some way we were all sharing 
each other. I understood this 
first when Teiko asked Marya 
if she could wear the bottom 
of those yellow pajamas. 

“What is this English word, 
pajamas?” she asked. “If I 
wear these bottoms or this 
bottom am I wearing a 
pajama?” 

“It’s not an English word at 
all,” Marya said. “It’s Hindu 
and Persian. It means, leg 
garment. So if you wear the 
bottom you’re wearing a pa- 
jama and if you wear only 
the top you’re wearing some- 
thing else. Not that I’d make 
a point of it.” 

Chris was quiet here, I 
noted. I asked him if he would 
like to trade with me. Had he 
ever worn a blue flannel 
nightgown? 

“Once,” he said. “A heavy 
scene. 1 was passing, or trying 
to, as a roommate when Mama 



MAYFLOWER ONE 



145 



dropped in. By chance, as it 
were.” 

So Chris traded with me. 

“You’re better in the T- 
shirt,” Teiko said to Chris. 

“So is she,” he said. 

We all kicked it around a bit 
after that. In the end 1 said, 
“And we all know that the 
studs were screened out.” I 
stood up and scratched my 
bottom. I said this: “The big 
breast award is mine. And the 
roundest, shapeliest bottom is 
Teiko’s. The best legs are 
Marya’s. And there are only 
two balls and Our Leader has 
both of them.” 

That’s how it was then — 
part of how it was — to be the 
first colonists on the moon. 

T he fourth day. Deploying 
instruments for the physical 
scientists and getting the telemetry 
going. Collecting the inevitable 
rocks, photographing everything. 
Getting to know you, getting to 
know all about you. Using the 
toilet, suiting up and going out onto 
the lunar surface. Sleeping beneath 
a sunlit sky. Lining up heads in the 
shadow of the central post, where 
hung the four life-supporting space 
suits. Sleeping on top of the 
sleeping bags now, the environment 
getting warmer, and rotating the 
positions from one steeping period 
to the next. 

The fourth night Chris was next 
to the center post, Teiko next and 



Julia and Marya beyond. It had not 
escaped Chris’s notice that the 
girls’ notebooks had been filling. 
With what was not within his 
province to ask. He was the CO and 
the doc and the only male. 

Chris thinking: / am a quarter of 
a million miles from what I call 
home, which home / can see if I 
move my head a little, but Just now 
I don't want to. I share a strange 
place with three great girls and 
there are no ground rules. 

There were no ground rules. 

Chris saw that Teiko was awake. 
He reached over and took her hand. 
They turned toward each other 
silently. Teiko accepted the hand of 
Chris and also the look in his eye. 
Too many jokes had been written 
about this on Earth, but here it was. 
Chris had not held Teiko’s hand 
before. 

“We’re all single or divorced,” he 
said. 

“Yes, boss.” 

“Cut that out.” 

“Yes, boss.” 

Do you remember the touch of 
your first girl’s hand in yours? The 
smell of hay in the loft of a barn in 
August? The first time you thought 
you knew where it was at? You 
didn’t, but you thought you did. Do 
you remember first times, first 
shattering events? Making out for 
the first time, being put down for 
the first time? 

Nectaris Base was a first time. 

“Why is that?” Chris asked. 

“What?” 



146 



GALAXY 



“That we’re all married and blew 
it — or are single? Single or di- 
vorced. Why is that? You have a 
very nice hand.” 

They held hands like kids. Chris 
disengaged that hand, and put both 
, of his upon Teiko’s cheeks. And he 
kissed her. And that was a first 
time. 

“You are the first to hear 
I’ Conway’s Law,” he said after some 
moments. 

I “Yes?” 

( “Earth simulations don’t simu- 
late.” 

Silence for a time before Teiko 
said, “I think I know what you 
}: mean.” Chris made to move on 

I; over. Julia and Marya seemed to be 
|i asleep. “No,” said Teiko. This was 
the first putdown on the moon. “I 
’ can’t say why,” she said. “I don’t 
I know.” They walked around the 
k dome a bit, still holding hands, be- 
I fore they got back on top of their 
I bags. 

I was toward the outside of 

( the dome, not asleep, and won- 
dered whether to say anything. 
But we are a talkative people, 
i “Teiko? Chris?” 1 whispered. 

I “I’m not asleep either,” 

Julia said. 

f “I’m sorry we’ve kept you 

j awake,” Chris and Teiko said 

more or less together. 

■ “That’s all right,” I said. 

“Maybe we should have had 
— more privacy?” 

“No.” 

“It’s better this way.” 



“Yes.” 

“Yes.” 

And it was evening and it 
was morning. 

T he seventh day and the sun as 
high as it was going to go. 
“Have you noticed,” asked 
Chris, “that this stuff tastes more 
like Cornish hen than the eggs 
Benedict it’s supposed to be?” 

“No. I think it is meant to be 
fish cakes. In New Hampshire we 
always had fish cakes on Sunday 
morning.” Julia ate as if she ex- 
pected to find a bone. 

“Is it really Sunday?” Teiko 
asked. “I thought the Christian 
habits of the day of rest were not 
so much practiced now.” 

“Well, not the church bit, but 
stomachs forget more slowly 
than other parts.” 

“What I would like to say for the 
record. Commander, is that they 
should have sent us food that was 
either fish cakes or black bread or 
sukiyaki — identifiable. I’m sure 
this brown stuff is very internation- 
al indeed, but it’s lost all its identity 
in the effort to please all of us. 
Perhaps 1 am not as ecumenical as 
lASA. Perhaps we might note 
that we don’t agree that making 
everything pleasing to everybody 
can — or should — be achieved. 
Either in food or in work 
assignments.” 

Marya looked at her vitamin- 
enriched and nameless juice. Chris 
longed for that cup of coffee. He 



MAYFLOWER ONE 



147 



hummed a nameless hymn. 

“Which gods shall we worship?” 
Marya asked. 

“Perhaps the gods should wor- 
ship us,” Julia said. “If not wor- 
ship, then observe, enjoy. 1 hope 
we give them a good trip. I have a 
feeling, you know, that they like 
us.” 

G etting to know you and 
coming on toward the be- 
ginning of the lunar night. The 
readouts show that the solar ac- 
cumulators are doing their job 
and it begins to get cold. Houston 
listens every day and Nagasaki 
will be all set to go when the time 
comes (the colonists are glad to 
hear this). In the meantime they 
are on their own, up there by them- 
selves, together and alone. A real 
trip, far out. And the sun begins 
to approach the lunar horizon 
and the ambiance within the dome 
changes. 

“Just a reminder,” Chris said, 
fingering his rook’s pawn. “When 
it’s night we won’t be going 
outside.” 

Teiko nodded. Marya and Julia 
were out looking at instru- 
ments. Chris was teaching Teiko 
chess. 

“They sent us up here without 
love,” Chris said, looking for a 
move not too catastrophic for 
Teiko. He moved the pawn for- 
ward one square. 

“Yes. They could have sent 
married couples. Or lovers. They 



sent us without love, yes. I hadn’t 
thought of it. Why did they do 
that?” 

“You’re the sociologist. You’ll 
find out and tell us. Isn’t a popu- 
lation of four a small one for your 
kind of thing?” 

“It is. Yes.” Teiko moved a 
knight out, not to the best square, 
but still developing the piece. 
“You weren’t angry with me 
before — Chris?” 

“When?” 

“When you wanted to come to 
my bag and I said no. And we 
were tired and held hands and 
walked around the dome.” 

“No, I wasn’t angry. Put down, 
yes, but not to where it really 
pricked my bubble. I was ready 
to crawl in, as you may have 
noticed.” 

Teiko smiled. “Yes. Anyway, 
I’m glad you weren’t — aren’t— 
angry.” 

Chris advanced a bishop and 
Teiko studied the board for some 
time. The sun was low over the 
horizon. “It doesn’t look good, 
does it? My game. Masha is 
better for you at this. Of course 
if we’d brought a go board — ” ‘ 

First Marya, then Julia entered 
the dome. Teiko threw up her 
hands and resigned. Marya and 
Julia unsuited. 

“It’s going to get dark soon, 
boss. When do we bring in the 
accumulators?” 

“First thing when we get up 
tomorrow. They’re still picking 



148 



GALAXY 



up a little sun. We’ll want all we 
can get.” 

“I suppose they’ll work all 
right,” Marya said. 

“We won’t last long otherwise.” 

I T WAS day and it was night — 
the first they had known for 
almost two weeks. The limb of the 
sun flickered on the horizon and 
died. Earthshine was there, but 
after those days under the sun the 
night was dark indeed. They all 
felt as if they had been pitched, 
with ceremony, into an unfamiliar 
cave. Black as Egypt’s night. 

“I have been one acquainted with 
the night,” said Julia. “But not 
like this one. But then who, before 
our intrepid foursome, has been 
acquainted with a two-week day on 
the moon? It makes for a contrast.” 
“Press close bare-bosom’d night 
— press close magnetic nourishing 
night!” Marya said this. 

“I’ll buy that,” Chris said. 
“And you sure as hell know more 
English than we do Russian. Who 
said that?” 

“Of course you’ll buy it. A poet 
of yours said it. Walt Whitman.” 
“Far out.” He glanced at Teiko. 
They were standing, the four of 
them, looking toward the place 
behind which the sun had fled. 
“Bare-bosomed night. Yes.” 

“Yes, Commander?” Teiko said. 
How to be provocative, she knew. 
She was a Japanese female. “And 
the night shall be filled with — 
music?” 



They were hoking it up, of 

course, to tone down the sense of 
awe they all felt. 

“Is a significant moment, this,” 
Marya said. “Therefore we do 

some tests.” 

Chris groaned. The others 
sighed. “I know you’re our resident 
psychologist and psychologists are 
doing nothing when they’re not 

testing. But not now. It’s the 

wrong time.” 

“Is the right time. Anyway, let’s 
try the lights and see if they work.” 
They did. She provided her subjects 
with test forms. 

“As CO 1 can override this, you 
know?” 

"Da. But you won’t.” And he 
didn’t. 

HI 

O F THE three persons you are 
with at this moment — to 
whom do you feel most antagonis- 
tic and why? 1 won’t have any 
trouble with that one, Chris 
thought, and punched the card. 
Toward whom do you feel the 
most positive affect? Jargonese, but 
I can answer that one too. Here 
are four amorphously unstruct- 
ured forms. Which pleases you 
most and why? Which do you dis- 
like most and why? 

There was quite a bit of that. 
Halfway through Chris realized 
he was Jabbing at the papers with 
force and that the girls were taking 
note. He gritted his teeth, then 



MAYFLOWER ONE 



149 



grinned inanely and did what he 
could to cool it. I'm out-numbered, 
he thought. 

“Now,” he said, the forms 
completed, “I will reassert my 
command of fhis, our first lunar 
colony.” The lights were soft 
and the temperature was com- 
fortable. It is cozy, Chris thought, 
finally understanding something 
of what Julia had been speaking 
of before. “Mission Design, in its 
infinite wisdom, has seen fit to 
provide us with a measurable 
amount of amenity. Niggardly but 
measurable. Significantly differing 
from zero. Fittingly, as it be- 
comes dark, the time for our even- 
ing meal approaches. Therefore 
we will precede dinner this evening 
with a vodka martini or two and 
with dinner we shall have — let’s 
see, what goes with brown hash — 
the Clos Vougeot twenty-nineteen. 
Any objections?” 

They applauded. Chris, sensing 
that he had made proper use of 
command, relaxed after the ten- 
sions of Marya’s testing. 

“I have to do my Job,” Marya 
said to Chris. 

“Of course, Masha,” Chris 
said. 

And they all sat together and 
had a martini or two. They called 
Houston to tell Mission Control 
they were having a small party and 
were sorry it couldn’t come. Then 
they broke contact. Mission De- 
sign was right, of course, in pro- 
viding a touch of amenity in the 



night. Houston knew that as soon 
as any human colony was put down 
on an Earth-type planet it would 
find things to ferment in no time. 

“I wouldn’t have thought,” 
Julia said later, “that brown hash 
could be a festive dish. But it was.” 
“It wasn’t the hash, it was the 
vodka,” Marya said. 

“Actually, as CO, I would have 
to say it was the noble Burgundy.” 
“Anyway, a party.” Teiko lay on 
her stomach on top of her sleeping 
bag, chin propped on her hands, 
considering the lunar night. 

Marya spoke: “Tovarisch 

Christopher Conway?” 

•'Da?” 

“We play a game of chess?” 

“Why not?” he asked. 

Chris drew white and played 
Bird’s opening. Marya responded 
strongly and Chris transposed into 
a variation of the Sicilian. Finding 
no advantage in this, on the eigh- 
teenth move he made an unsound 
pawn sacrifice. Marya jumped on 
it and Chris lost the game. He 
toppled his king and rose. 

“We can’t do this often, God 
knows, but we do have an al- 
lowance of brandy. I propose that 
we broach that bottle right now, 
an ounce and a half to each, as a 
suitable nightcap. Majority vote 
wins. How say you all?” 

They all said yes and had a 
nightcap. They changed their 
sleeping raiments again and went 
to bed. The garments were suf- 
ficiently loose to be interchange- 



150 



GALAXY 



able. Who wore what they no 
longer recorded. They found it 
amusing to change around — it was 
something to do. And the rotation 
of sleeping gear or the lack of it 
spoke a symbolic language. They 
prepared to sleep for the first time 
in the dark. The drone of the life- 
support system made a pleasant 
backdrop, was more a condition 
of existence than an annoyance. 
The crescent of Earth was there for 
them to look at. They did not have 
to put their heads in the shadow 
of the central pillar now, so they 
arranged themselves differently. 
Marya and Julia placed their bags 
parallel to the circumference of 
the floor, Marya to the north, 
Julia to the east. Teiko and Chris 
were together to the south, heads 
at the outer wall, feet toward the 
center. That all four heads were 
at the outer wall was not sur- 
prising — they were looking at the 
lunar night for the first time. Not 
just the first time for them, the 
first for anybody. 

“Masha?” Chris called. 

“Yes? Da?" 

“No hard feelings about the 
chess game. 1 won’t play the Birds 
against you again. I’m just think- 
ing. You’re our psychologist. 
And a beautiful one. Your main 
bag is to test us, is that right?” 

“This is a simplistic view, 
Chris, but if you have to say it 
that way — well, yes.” 

“Right. I’m just thinking out 
loud. Julia?” 



“Yes, Commander?” 

“Cut the crap, slave. In twenty- 
five words or less, just what is 
your mission here? Between the 
four of us. Psychiatrists have to 
do with emotional illness, its 
causes and cures, right?” 

“Right.” 

“So. We’re not emotionally 
ill, none of us. We were screened 
for that. So why are you, sweet girl 
that you are, here?” 

“Flattery will get you no- 
where, boss. We’re not emotionally 
ill. Not now, Chris.” 

“We might crack up under the 
stress of this, our mission?” 

“More or less, that’s right.” 
“Suppose you’re the one who 
cracks up?” 

“It’s not meant to go that way, 
boss. But if I do we’ve a psy- 
chologist, a sociologist and an 
M.D. to take care of me. You 
ought to be able to handle it.” 
“We’re both M.D.s, as far as 
that goes, though our trainings 
are quite different. Teiko?” 

“Yes, Commander?” 

“Goddamn it. I wish to hell you 
would all stop saying that. Any- 
way — Teiko, your thing is the 
fundamental laws of social rela- 
tions, right?” 

“You are simplistic again, poor 
boy, but this is, yes, the general 
idea. The origin, organization and 
functioning of human society, 
yes.” 

“So why are you here, lovely 
one?” 



MAYFLOWER ONE 



151 



“How carefully you make the 
compliments equal to all. Very 
ecumenical. I am here because 
we are a human society. A small 
one, but a society. 

“Then which of you,” Chris 
asked, addressing all,' “can say 
why it is we were sent up here 
without love?” 

They had talked about this 
some after Chris had first raised 
the question with Teiko. No one 
said anything right now. 

Finally Julia said, “It might 
be an undesirable complication. 
Undesirable from Mission De- 
sign’s point of view.” 

“Why they sent us here without 
love?” Teiko said. “Maybe to 
see if we would find it.” 

And it was the first night on the 
moon and they slept. 



This is the third day of the 
night. After breakfast this 
morning I began to make a 
go board. Chris has been los- 
ing to Masha at chess and I 
think I should teach him go. 
I don’t think I can learn how 
to play a good game of chess. 
Chris loses to Masha and he 
tries not to show that he is 
hurt by this. Why he is hurt 
this much 1 don’t know, but I 
don’t think it is because 
Masha is a woman. So I 
think I will teach him the game 
of my country. We will have to 
find something to use for 



pieces, but Chris says this is 
no problem. 

But if I teach Chris go I 
will beat him, because I grew 
up with this game. So why do I 
want to teach Chris how to 
play go? To hurt him some 
more? Certainly not — 1 know 
that. Though 1 cannot give 
him a good game of chess, 1 
think he can soon give me a 
good game of go — maybe 
that is it. There is something 
in Masha’s way of beating 
Chris that I don’t think is 
good. She doesn’t beat him all 
the time — Chris wins about 
two out of five. But they play 
too much. 

T eiko sat on a folding chair 
at one of the two tables. The 
lighting was not extravagant, but 
it was adequate. She had taped 
together four sheets of paper into a 
larger one and was ruling lines. 
Chris had been taking readings on 
the accumulators and was at the 
other table, plotting curves. He 
finished and rose. 

“It looks good,” he said. “Plenty 
of heat and light. You want to give 
Houston the report today?” He 
walked over to see what she was 
up to. “What’s that?” 

“A board for go. I will teach 
you.” 

Marya, who had been lying on 
the floor with the third lamp, 
studying test scores, looked over. 
There were two tables and three 



152 



GALAXY 



lamps. Julia was reading at the 
table Chris had been working at. 
This conversation didn’t interest 
her. She was reading The Brothers 
K, as she called it. 

“How does it go?” Chris asked 
and Teiko outlined the basic 
strategy. 

“We’ll need pieces,” she said. 

“How many?” 

“A hundred or so of each of two 
kinds of small things, small 
enough to be put on these — 
vertices — would be enough to 
start with.” 

“We ought to have enough small 
washers and nuts for that. No 
problem. Suppose you talk to 
Houston today, all right?” They 
had been taking turns at this. 

“Give me the curves on the ac- 
cumulators,” she said. They were 
only three days into the night, 
but they all had a profound 
interest in those curves, neatly 
drawn lines on light coordinate 
paper, that told them whether 
they had enough energy to make 
it to the dawn. “That’s the only 
important thing, isn’t it?” 

Chris nodded and turned on the 
rig- 



girl and she says no. This is, 
and I understand that, a totally 
unfair and entirely indefen- 
sible attitude. But that’s the 
way it is and that’s the way it 
was when Teiko said no. You 
try to show that you’re not 
cut up, that it isn’t important. 
But it is and it always will be. 
So says the commander — and 
1 wish they’d stop calling me 
that. Masha beats me at 
chess, but that’s not where it’s 
at. 1 borrowed a notebook 
from Masha to write this in. 
She’s got notebooks the way 
some chipmunks I know 
have sunflower seeds. Enough 
to last forever. I see Earth up 
there. There’s lot’s of cloud 
and I’m not really oriented, 
so I can’t see the chipmunks. 
Matter of fact, it would take 
one hell of a telescope to see 
a chipmunk from here. The 
girls’ notebooks are for future 
study, and the enlightenment 
of society. This one isn’t, 
damn it. It’s for me. So, Dear 
Diary, you son of a bitch, it 
hurts. It do. 



I haven’t been keeping a 
notebook — or notebooks — like 
the girls. That isn’t part of my 
job. But maybe I’d best keep 
one for myself. Maybe I’ll 
throw it away before we leave. 
There isn’t a man alive, that 
I’ve heard of, who isn’t cut 
down when he wants to bed his 



T eiko and Chris sat at one 
of the two tables, illuminated 
by one of the three lights. Teiko’s 
go board was between them. 
Julia and Marya were both read- 
ing at the other table, using only 
the second light. This saved 
energy. Chris had a hundred or so 
small nuts in a Dixie cup. Teiko had 



MAYFLOWER ONE 



153 



the same number of small washers 
in a similar cup. You knew what 
hardware a colony would need. 

“It is war,” Teiko said. “You 
see? You must surround the — 
opponent — and capture him, so.” 
She showed several ways how this 
could be done. “We start first 
using just a little of the board, 
because you not know how to play. 
But you learn fast, 1 know.” 

“Roger. Fire one,” Chris said. 
“You first,” she said. 

“Screw that. Girls first.” 

Teiko placed a washer near a 
corner on Chris’s side of the board. 
Chris studied the position and set 
down a nut. This continued for a 
time, but not for long. 

“You see how it goes now, yes?” 
said Teiko. “Better luck next 
time.” 

“Luck isn’t in it, sweet girl, and 
you know it. Set ’em up in the 
other alley.” 

“What?” 

“That’s from a different game. 
Bowling. What 1 mean is, let’s 
start again and maybe I show you 
something. I’m first this time.” 
Chris learned and he learned 
rapidly. By the time it was time to 
go to bed he had the fundamentals. 

Bed, then — sleeping bags, rather 
— Julia and Marya sacked out on 
the other side, Teiko and Chris 
the way they’d been all of the nights 
of the night. The pleasant backdrop 
of the droning life-support. No 
more sleeping on top of the bags, 
as in the tropic day. Now it 



was the arctic night. Chris put 
his bag close to Teiko’s. Watch it, 
baby, he told himself. Watch it. 

“I like that game,” he said. 

“I thought you would. We play 
some more tomorrow. We get very 
close together in here, yes? I mean, 
feets and yards. Why can’t we go 
outside a little, look at the instru- 
ments — or something?” 

“The suits aren’t made for it, 
you know that. It’s two hundred 
and sixty-odd below out there. We 
couldn’t even walk to Pearl Harbor 
and back.” 

“Yes. I know the briefing. But 
we could go just a little.” 

“Go just a little and use up a lot 
of energy. You’re not getting 
claustrophobic?” 

“No, Chris. I just think it would 
be nice if we could take a little 
walk, that’s all. You know. Back 
to the cave, all right? The females 
stay here and you go out and hit 
a bear over the head with a club. 
Haul it back to the cave and we all 
eat. Ferment something in its skull 
and we all drink. Back to the cave. 
The men couldn’t stay in the cave 
— somebody had to go out.” 

Chris said nothing for a time. 
They looked at each other and out 
into the wild night, wild in its still- 
ness. “I’m all right, Teiko,” he 
said. “Look at me, am I not all 
right?” She nodded. “We’re on a 
far-out trip,” he said and reached 
for her hand. It wasn’t hard to 
find. “I’m not going to crawl out 
of this — bag —but I am going to do 



154 



GALAXY 



this. Unless you find a way to stop 
it. Teiko.” 

And he kissed her again. This 
was the second time. It lasted quite 
a while and it was tender. They 
went to sleep. And Chris, sim- 
plistic male CO that he was, poor 
boy (as has been said), didn’t know 
what the hell was going on. 

Teiko thought she did. 

Julia and Marya were asleep, 
lost in their own wonders. 

IV 

This is the seventh night 
of the night, which makes it 
just about the midnight of the 
night. 1 don’t think my pur- 
pose will be served on this 
mission. 1 don’t think any of us 
is going to go bananas. Chris 
was put down by Teiko when 
he tried to make out and she 
said no. He tried to pretend 
that nothing had happened. 
And he didn't succeed. All men 
are hurt by a putdown, so why 
the hell not admit it? Anyway, 
Chris was put down, but he’s 
not about to fold. 

Masha and Chris have been 
about even in chess lately, but 
Chris has lost interest in chess. 
He’s crazy about go, though he 
hasn’t won more than one 
game out of four so far. 1 also 
think he’s crazy about Teiko. 
They sleep together over 
there all the time. I don’t 
mean sleep together, I mean 



their sleeping bags are cheek 
to cheek and they talk a lot. 

And I’m a little bit jealous, 
1 have to say that. We change 
our sleeping clothes— or the 
lack of them — around, but 
Teiko and Chris are always 
together over there. Not that 
we’re excluded — we’d be 
welcome close to them, I 
think— but that’s the way it 
is. 

The next colony doesn’t 
need, I think, such a scientific 
bunch as we. Couples, maybe. 
In love, maybe, married or 
not — I don’t know. I know 
I’m getting horny as anything 
— it’s been a long time — and 
nothing I can do about it, un- 
less I’m really interested in 
myself or in Masha. I’m in- 
terested in me, all right, but 
not in that way^ — and in 
that way I’m not interested in 
Masha at all. Though she is a 
nice person. And she’s not 
going to blow her cool. I’m 
interested in Chris, but the key 
to that door is in other hands. 
And he must be raunchy as 
hell by now. So are we, but 
women put up with it better, 
the record shows. How to be 
the first psychiatrist on the 
moon in ten easy lessons. Or 
five hard ones. Old joke. 1 
think I’m a little anoxic. 

|N THE eighth day of the 
" night all systems were go. 



MAYFLOWER ONE 



155 



The accumulator curves were bet- 
ter than expected. There was resid- 
ual fear of not enough energy, but 
this had no realistic base. Chris 
and Teiko placed go. Julia read a 
lot and Marya brooded. The truth 
of the matter was that none of 
them had much to do except 
colonize the moon and tell Houston 
how exciting it all was. 

Everything fell into the fan at 
1:20 Local Time on the eighth day. 

Marya, who had been sitting on 
her sleeping bag, looking outside, 
was restless for some moments. 
She lay down on her stomach. Then 
she lay on her back. Then she called 
Chris. 

“Yes?” 

“Chris.” The way she said it, 
it came out more like Chrees and 
he liked the sound of it. “Chris. 
Something is wrong. I hurt very 
much — here.” She put her hand on 
her abdomen. Chris examined her 
and asked some questions. 

No way for it to be an ap- 
pendix — 1 knew that and we all 
had our scars to prove it. No 
way. But it was sure as hell 
something and 1 knew, not 
wanting to know, what it was. 
It was catastrophe, internal 
disaster to Masha and to a 
small child forming inside her 
— and external cataclysm for 
the mission. I was the doctor, 
right? Right. So make with 
the tools. The sphygmomano- 
meter worked well, but it told a 



hairy tale. I kept thinking of 
appendicitis, knowing it 
couldn't be that, knowing 
that acute appendices do not 
arrive with this sense of drama, 
of urgency — they put them- 
selves on stage with fewer 
kettledrums in the pit. I 
palped Masha’s stomach. I 
knew I’d need help and lots of 
it. 

<< TTOW did you bypass the 
-i-JL pregnancy test?” Chris 
asked. 

“A — friend in the lab,” she said. 
“I’m sorry, Chris.” 

The other two girls stood beside 
the harried MOD — the Medical 
Officer of the Day. Every day and 
all night on this mission. He drew 
them to one side. 

“Julia,” he said. This is an 
ectopic, or I never went to medical 
school. We’ll have to move fast.” 
“You’re sure?” 

“Yes.” 

“We can’t operate in here.” 

“If we don’t we’ve got a dead 
Masha.” 

Teiko went over to hold Marya’s 
hand. 

“This isn’t exactly an OR at 
Massachusetts General, but we’re 
going to have to make do. Good 
thing they threw in the surgical kit 
at the last minute. We’ll use in- 
travenous nonathal. You know 
where it is, get going.” 

“1 don’t know how sterile this 
amphitheater is, chief, but if you 



156 



say so — ” She got going. 

Chris checked the big book and 
saw that the number on the box 
they needed was 517. “Teiko,” he 
said. “Would you get box five- 
seventeen from that stack over 
there?” He went to Marya and told 
her what they were going to do. He 
placed the two folding tables to- 
gether (casting the unfinished game 
of go aside with regret) near 
Marya’s sleeping bag and arranged 
the three lights. He placed two 
sleeping bags atop the tables. 
The first operating table on the 
moon. 

“We need another table,” Julia 
said. “We don’t have one, so I’ll 
put things on these chairs.” 

“Yes. But where the hell is five- 
seventeen? We need it now. Teiko?” 
Chris kept his voice low. 

“It isn’t where it’s supposed to 
be, Chris. 1 sorry.” 

“All right, we’ll find it. We’d 
better call Houston. Teiko, would 
you do that? I’ll get that damned 
surgical kit and we’ll put this show 
on the road.” 

“What shall I say?” 

“Say that Masha has an ectopic 
pregnancy and we’re going to 
operate. If we can find the equip- 
ment.” 

As the other M.D. on this 
trip I did what I could while 
Chris and Teiko looked for the 
box that wasn’t there. Chris 
asked me to look for the check 
list. I found it and everything 



on it was checked off, but box 
517 wasn’t on the list. A last- 
minute addition. Chris told 
Teiko to get Houston and took 
the microphone from her. 

“We’ve an ectopic preg- 
nancy here,” he said, “and the 
surgical kit, thrown in at the 
last minute by the infinite 
wisdom of Mission Design, 
wasn’t put on the check list. 
Right? So I’ll have to go out to 
Pearl Harbor and get it. 1 
may get it or I may not. But 
heads best be rolling in the 
sand down there before the 
next hour has run its course 
and this is the last you’ll be 
hearing from us for some 
time. Yes, I know the tests 
were negative. I’ll tell you 
later.” 

He shut off the rig. 

“Keep Masha as comfortable 
as you can. I’ve got to get that 
misbegotten box out of Pearl 
Harbor. I’ll be right back.” He 
prepared to suit up. 

“You can’t do it,” Teiko said. 
“Remember what you said when 
we were talking about going out 
for a few minutes?” 

“We do what we have to. What 
I meant was we couldn’t — I 
couldn’t — take a pleasure walk 
out there for the hell of it. But if 
it’s something we have to do, we 
damn well do it. All right?” 

“No,” she said with authority of 
endless generations of Japanese 



MAYFLOWER ONE 



157 



women behind her. “No. Is not all 
right. So. You will go, but 1 will 
go with you.” 

She reached for her suit. 



Chris protested, but she had 
him dead to rights. It was 
chancy to go out into that 
cool, but that it could be done 
lay within the fringes of possi- 
bility. If Teiko went to hold 
the torch, leaving Chris free 
to locate the box, it would 
save seconds, maybe even a 
minute. Chris alone might 
fail, but the two of them might 
make it. Or die out there to- 
gether, box 517 halfway from 
here to there, haphazardly 
dropped, sitting useless on the 
lunar soil. I did what I could 
for Masha, which wasn’t 
much. I got the lot set up. 
Some operating room. Earth 
almost f^ull up there and I’m 
waiting for sterile gloves and 
surgical instruments, masks 
and gowns. Alt put the hell into 
one box 517. They turned the 
temperature controls of their 
suits all the way up and I 
watched them leave. 



«TS NOT cold at all,” Teiko 
A said, halfway to Pearl Har- 
bor. They were on local circuit— 
Houston heard none of this. 

“You didn’t have to come.” 

They approached Pearl Harbor 
and the chill began to come 
through. “No. You so right, al- 



ways right. Commander. I didn’t 
have to come and you didn’t have 
to go. We even, yes?” 

The hatch was still open. Why 
not? Teiko pointed the light and 
the box was there. 

“Ah,” said Chris. “There you 
are, you bastard.” 

He fumbled it into his gloves. 
They started back. 

“Do you know what cold is?” 
“Now I begin to know, 1 think. 
I also think we can make it back. 
You?” 

“Yes.” 

They didn’t talk after that, but 
they found out what cold was, 
though the life-support systems 
were putting out every joule at 
their disposal. 

Being cold was like being en- 
closed, for openers, within a block 
of solidly surrounding ice. Enclose 
this, then, within larger blocks, the 
mass of ice expanding outward. 
Then it begins to grow inward, to 
include every part of your body 
that has sensory end-organs. The 
lymph congeals and the blood 
solidifies. Then the ice begins to 
melt, but you know it only seems 
that way — it really means that 
you’re about to buy the farm and 
can’t feel anything. Then you 
think how nice it would be to lie 
down and go to sleep. 

They made it. Just. 

By the time I was warmed up 
Chris was operating, Julia 
helping him. When I could I 



158 



GALAXY 



went over to see what they 
were doing. They told me to 
put a mask on. I did and then I 
could go close and see. 

It was so sad. Masha’s baby 
had decided to live in the tube 
and not where it was supposed 
to, in the uterus. Womb. 
Chris cut her open and they 
took lots of blood from the 
peritoneum — yes, I had train- 
ing here also and knew most of 
the words. Tie off the bleeding 
points, remove the tube, but 
save the ovary if you can. He 
did. Antibiotics systemically 
and topically and the drip drip 
drip of the glucose, slow in the 
lunar gravity. The first lunar 
hospital. How many firsts 
are we to make on this mis- 
sion? Not the last one yet, 1 
think. I wish I had let Chris 
come to me that night. He 
won’t do it now, I think. 



“Houston from Nectaris Base.’’ 
“Roger, Chris. About time, may 
we say?’’ 

“Best not to lose your cool, 
Steve. We’ve had a problem up 
here. Or down here, according to 
your parameters.” 

“We somehow gathered that, 
Chris. Would it be within your 
capability to report?” 

“My goodness. We really got 
you up tight, didn’t we? Sorry 
about that. However, this is how 
it is . .” 



He told them. And that was the 
beginning of the end of the eighth 
day of the night. 

C HRIS moved his sleeping 
bag next to Marya’s. It was 
fitting that the surgeon be near his 
patient. Julia came close and so, 
somewhat later, did Teiko. 

Marya was out of the anesthesia. 
“I’m sorry, Chris — 1 really am.” 

“I know. You wanted to make 
the mission and you did what you 
had to do. No sweat. I’m sorry you 
lost it — if you wanted to keep it, 
Masha.” 

“Yes. I did.” 

Chris is tired, Teiko thought. 
Chris is tired and he’s still put 
down, Julia thought. 

Chris, Marya thought, took my 
baby from me. He had to, I know. 

They were so close they could all 
touch each other, though Marya 
wasn’t interested. She was about 
out. 

Chris said, his hand vaguely on 
some part of Teiko, “I wouldn’t 
have made it back if you hadn’t 
been there holding the light. You 
were right. Domo.” 

“ Doitashimashta," she said. “We 
do it.” 

“Julia,” Chris said, “you’re a 
competent scrub nurse. I really 
didn’t know that — it isn’t in your 
profile.” 

“Screw profiles.” 

“Yes.” 

There was a closeness. 



MAYFLOWER ONE 



159 



We tried to go to sleep, but 
Masha was the only one who 
really made it. After all, she’d 
had major surgery that day and 
was well downed with phar- 
maceuticals. I like that word — 
why say drugs? I pretended 1 
was asleep, but they both knew 
1 wasn’t. 

Chris said, “I’m going out 
for a while.’’ 

Teiko: “Again?” 

“Just down to the pub for a 
pint of bitter. Be right back. 
Or just to hit a bear over the 
head. All right?” 

Chris checked Masha, saw 
that I was right there, not quite 
asleep. He took his suit from 
the rack and put it on. It was — 
as I’d been the first to point 
out — cozy inside, the four of 
us together there, warm. A bad 
problem coming into us and 
being solved, thrust out. I 
checked Masha. She would 
be fine, just fine. No baby, not 
this time. But The Mission 
survived. And why should that 
matter so much, I wondered, 
but I knew that it did. Chris 
went out. 

Teiko moved her sleeping 
bag to the other side of the 
pillar. She moved Chris’s bag 
also. She looked at me. “You 
understand?” she said. 

“Who knows?” was the best 
I could do. My civilized genes 
don’t go back as far as hers. 
She held my hand and we 



watched Chris clomp about 
out there, near the dome. He 
looked up at Earth and he 
looked at all of the lunar hori- 
zon. He seemed to raise his fist 
and hurl it into the night. 

He broke the lock and came 
back home. He checked the ac- 
cumulator curves. He checked 
that I was half awake and was 
looking after Masha. He 
knew where Teiko was and that 
was where he went. 

“Chris?” 

“Yes?” 

“It’s cold out there.” 

“Yes. Why did you go again?” 
“To hit the bear on the head and 
bring back meat.” 

“To the cave.” 

“Yes.” 

“What is it like to be alone out 
there?” 

“Don’t knock it if you haven’t 
tried it. Not as nice as here, 
though.” 

“They sent us here without love.” 
“Yes.” 

“They blew it.” 

“Or made it,” Chris said. 

Earth, home, was up there, some- 
what past full, but there were 
clouds and they couldn’t see the 
Virgin Islands. 

“So we found it,” she said and 
they did. And that was the end of 
the eighth day of the first night of 
the first colony on the moon. 

After that nothing went accord- 
ing to plan. ★

SONYA 

DORMAN 

Success is something 
to celebrate — if 
you live . 




I HAVE lost something. I have 
lost something very dear but it 
must be far gone in our history for 
me to forget it. Our camp is down 
in the foothills — from here we can 
see the blue maze of meadows and 
scrub woods of this planet. It’s 
good to get away from our techno- 
logies for a while, though we’re all 
secure in the knowledge that they 
wait our return. 

Bern Benn, the tour leader, is 
shouldering his pack. We’re ready 
to climb the trail again. “Let’s go 
then,” Bern Benn says, with his 
sherbet smile, more cool than 
sweet, I think. 

Our small group is made up of 
technologists all secure in our posi- 
tions. Home waits for us back on 
another planet with orders, 
co-workers, everything smoothly 
running and sliding together, which 
is why we have come out here to 
look at strange birds, pick up burrs 
(longweed, with yellow spikes), 
blister our heels in new hiking 
boots, eat sparsely by smoky camp- 
fires. For a little while we relive our 
primitive histories. 

The trail winds up over grasses 
and rocks. There are a few plants 
that have pale blue blossoms which 
remind me of something I have left 
behind. When I was a little girl I 
treasured each piece of smashed 
plastiglass or burnt rubble, but the 
pleasant complexities of adult life 
have made this treasuring of things 
unnecessary. We all travel light and 



161 



travel far and we never pick things 
growing by the way. 

Moshe Snow, the cyberneticist, 
and Alma, the neurochemist, come 
alongside as the trail widens. They 
are a pair, as we all fondly know. 
“It’s good out here,” Moshe says, 
breathing deeply of the air, which 
hasn't as much oxygen as we like, 
and that is part of the lure of the 
tour. 

Alma is a skinny thing, with fin- 
gers like bones, and a small, 
somewhat lined face; she is sweet 
like the pale blue flowers which re- 
mind me. But I forget. 

“I love this,” Alma says, her 
boots going thunk! thunk! as if she 
had a lot of weight to put in them. 

Everyone is happy. The day is 
just beginning and our leader is a 
happy, homeless man at the head of 
our group, stomping manfully up 
the hills. To him this is an old story. 

Moshe gestures up toward Bern 
Benn. “1 keep wondering what he 
thinks of us with our new boots and 
creased pants — he has to teach us 
such simple things, like the way to 
put the firewood so it burns.” 

“Always a draft,” Alma says, 
imitating Bern’s voice. 

“He’s very efficient,” 1 say, not 
wanting anything to become rough 
or sticky. “He certainly knows 
what he’s doing.” 

“1 should hope so,” MosTie says. 
A little contempt in his voice? 1 
don’t like that. Bern Benn is as 
good at his Job as I am at mine, 
taking apart the particles of an 



equinox or predicting the solar 
winds. Weather Person that 1 am, I 
can recognize another expert when 
1 meet him. 

Alma and Moshe slowly draw a- 
head of me on the path, catching up 
with Sonol, who has been forging 
onward. Behind me the older man, 
Tarrold, is climbing and practicing 
breath control. It makes his mouth 
a funny shape, but 1 don’t laugh, 
because we have been friendly. 

Suddenly a fluster of birds goes 
up from the shrubby growth on our 
left. Binoculars are swung up and 
we pause to look, to call out to each 
other, comparing notes on size, 
color, shape of the beaks. Their 
beaks are thick and hard, for they 
crack the unmt seeds out of the 
rock crevices. We, too, have tried 
unwit seed roasted in a pan over the 
campfire. They are tasty enough, 
but no one experienced anything 
from eating them. Perhaps because 
we were all so relaxed after a day of 
hiking that we could hardly relax 
any more. 

We reach another bare ridge by 
the time of our noon meal. Packs 
come off. We sit in a ragged circle, 
chatting about the birds and plants. 
Bern has collected a pocketful of 
unwit seeds. Eaten unroasted, they 
are rather bitter, but quench the 
thirst. 1 pop some of them into my 
mouth and crunch them while the 
meal is being laid out by Bern and 
Hagne Benn. They work well to- 
gether, shifting burdens back and 
forth, finding rare plants, knowing 



162 



GALAXY 



the names of everything we’re 
interested in. 

Hagne goes around and gives out 
the rest of the seeds for those of us 
who are still thirsty, before the 
water is sluiced out of the evaptank 
for us. Pale sunlight glitters on 
the fuzz of blond hair at Hague’s 
nape. 1 think it’s comical that she 
and Bern have the same hair, as if 
they had made it so. But they are 
nice, direct people and like to show 
us this different land. 

I SLOWLY crunch up the seeds, 
feeling my mouth become cool 
and less parched, watching the dis- 
tance for a different bird; listening 
for a sound, the unfamiliar, the 
odd, that we came here for. I have 
lost something precious but it no 
longer hurts, whatever it was. 

Oh, you, you are a person at a 
great distance. There is an in- 
tolerable distance of parsecs be- 
tween us then, and us now. The sun 
is moving rapidly and strikes my 
face, blow after blow across my 
cheek. The seed has a bitter, 
quenching taste. Under my head the 
tufts of grass are coarse and wiry. I 
remember you were doing some- 
thing green with your hands, 
causing growth. Then they came 
and shot you. Or was it poisons? 
Your hair was the color of mercury 
before you died. 

“Well! What’s the weather to 
be?’’ Tarrold asks, sitting down be- 
side me with his smile and his old 
boots, for he has hiked before. I’m 



sure his boots hang by his door at 
home, to show everyone how they 
have been used — what he has is 
very nearly an addiction, but he 
doesn’t apologize. Well, 1 like a 
person who makes his choices, 
covers his tracks, travels light with 
good boots and tested ideas. 

“This isn’t my atmosphere,’’ I 
murmur, lying in the sweet grass, 
which is long as hairs around me, 
though a moment ago it was tufted 
and springy. Something green used 
to grow and we kissed — there were 
seasons and root-groups, plants and 
people. I can’t imagine being 
rooted in one spot and always with 
the same faces near me. Though of 
course the word “imagine” is no 
longer of use. 

At the upper end of our circle 
there seems to be an argument, 
voices breaking out. I don’t want to 
listen. 

“It was a mistake,” Hagne’s 
voice sounds clear. I watch it go up 
like a flight of birds, soaring, a lu- 
minous streak through the whitish 
air. 

Bern walks down to us. “The 
seeds,” he says. “Have you eaten 
them all?” 

“Long ago,” 1 say and stick out 
my tongue to show how empty it is. 
Not a word or a hull on it. 

“They’re best roasted — we won’t 
eat them raw again,” he says. 

I can’t be bothered to say 
anything more, lying in Tarrold’s 
shadow with an arm over my brow, 
looking through the rainbows of my 



JOURNEY 



163 



hairs to the sky overhead. Some- 
thing is gone and I miss it. 

“What’s wrong with the seeds?” 
Moshe calls out as Bern passes. 

“Their effect is inconsistent with 
your lung function,” Bern replies 
and continues on his way to dis- 
tribute the foods. 

With one hand I touch the base of 
my throat where the purifier was 
implanted years ago and I see that 
Tarrold has made the same motion. 
It’s instinctive, I suppose, especially 
among technologists, who realize 
how adapted we are. Ordinary 
people eat, sleep and die without a 
thought of thanks. 

Hagne brings the food down to us 
at our end of the group, and I push 
myself into a sitting position in 
order to swallow comfortably. It’s 
still a little before noon and above 
us lie the slopes toward the big hill 
where we’ll camp tonight and fare 
rough. Each time we look up that 
way we feel a shiver of excitement. 
Up there is far beyond the ex- 
perience of most of us who re- 
member our flattened, smoothed, 
slippery home planet where wheels 
do everything. Here we encounter 
all kinds of irregularities; that was 
why we came, to step up, to force 
the muscles, to empty the mind. 
Not to imagine, that illusionary 
function, but to experience prime 
reality, each of us with his own 
brain. 

“What I like,” Tarrold says sud- 
denly, in a voice of consummate de- 
spair, “is being so alive together.” 



He shocks me and I stare at him, 
but he’s gazing down the slopes and 
his jaws are munch-munching the 
food. 

“But aren’t we always alive to- 
gether?” I ask. 

“Yes, of course.” He flicks a 
small look at me and goes back to 
staring down the hills again. Then 
he wipes his hands on his knees with 
a consciously vulgar gesture and 
says, “This is my last hike.” 

A funny thing for an addict to 
say. “You’ll be back,” I assure 
him. “Here or on another planet 
somewhere — you won’t stop. 
Haven’t you been doing this for 
years?” 

“Years,” he repeats. 

“Years,” someone else says and 
somehow I reinterpret it: “tears,” 
or “fears,” or other words that 
rhyme and beat on my breastbone. 

“Years,” Tarrold says, pinching 
the ridge between his brows with 
thumb and forefinger. 

Fears ago I had something green, 
such as the stuff now crushed under 
my boots. When I look back it has 
sprung up again in my wake — my 
passing hasn’t made anything dif- 
ferent, which is a great relief. Like 
all of us, I avoid damage whenever 
possible. When one can’t avoid it at 
least it need not be commented on, 
mourned or balladed about. That 
way lies the old danger that nearly 
destroyed us. Tread lightly, travel 
fast, make your choices and go. 
Like the implanted purifier, these 
concepts are the saving ones.

We hike on, occasionally stop- 
ping to examine a plant or look up 
to see some flying thing. The air at 
one place is full of weed seeds 
traveling the air currents, spiky 
dark things flying from one place to 
another. 

“Little space boats,” Kissie says, 
laughing, capturing a cluster of 
them in her hand. 

“Oh, don’t,” Hanson says, but 
she hasn’t hurt them. She opens her 
hand and gives a toss and they fly 
out into the air again and continue 
their journey unaffected. 

So we rise smoothly and calmly 
on our own muscular power into 
the bands of blue hill, where the 
growth is less, the air cooler, the 
rocks more numerous, slatey dark 
gray. Bits of the rock break off 
under our heels or we scrape our 
boots across them and leave 
hieroglyphs, which some following 
group may read. Yet I see, when I 
look ahead, that the rock before us 
is clean and untouched, though 
twenty tours a year must come here. 

W E STOP for a moment. 

Pernt Yollo’s pacemaker has 
to be adjusted, so we gather around 
him, trying not to be impatient 
while he removes wires, puts wires 
back. Hagne gives him a few lung- 
fuls of precious oxygen from her 
hand tank. One corner of his mouth 
twitches, but it often does. We ig- 
nore it, because he’s a Central man, 
one of the builders of the Computer 
Expander. While we wait with the 



pleasant faces we’ve put on, each of 
us is counting the lungfuls of our 
emergency oxygen he uses. 

“Let’s go,” Bern says. He leads 
us — Hagne brings up the rear and 
between the two bronzed, blond 
guides we’re well watched over and 
cared for. 

It’s a little monotonous, but 
makes for peaceful thinking, all this 
steady upward tramp. I was 
thinking of last year when that 
person Kagge had said to me, 
“Gaia, I’m remorseful with lust for 
you — ” and I unfortunately 
laughed. So often I do, so unfortu- 
nately. It is often a humorous occa- 
sion, such as buckling yourself into 
a watch rocket and someone mum- 
bles in your ear, “Oh, 1 am 
perishing of persistence for you,” 
and off you go into the storm 
center, leaving him to perish with 
someone else. Like the rocks we 
think we are marking on this climb. 

The air and the sky are as calm as 
we. This is a stormless place. 1 
would have nothing to do if I 
lived here. Fatal! Man is born 
to function. 

Toward late afternoon we have 
risen into areas of sharp black rock. 
No plants here and it’s cool enough 
to wear our parkas. A little frost 
sparkles in crevices. A good camp- 
fire will be welcome tonight. 

“We must make it before dark,” 
Hagne urges us and we keep 
climbing through the longest day 
we’ve spent on the trail so far. Even 
the hardiest of us begins to weary

and droop. From the front Bern 
Benn pulls us along with his voice, 
the hale gesture of his arm — from 
the rear Hagne urges and presses us 
forward. Pushed and pulled, toiling 
in a line, clitfibing and climbing. By 
the time we make camp we’re tired 
enough to be silent. The mountain 
looms over us, darker in the dark. 

Soon the fire leaps and dances in 
the night. Kissie and Pernt help to 
pass the food around. For a while 
we’re busy with it and there’s no 
need to talk. Hagne and Bern set up 
our beds in a ring around the fire. 
Some of us roll into the beds right 
after eating and fall asleep im- 
mediately. Others stay grouped at a 
little distance and talk softly of how 
beautiful the dark is, being 
strange — how splendid the day be- 
hind us, how miraculous the day to 
come. 

The ground bed is so soft 1 sink 
into it, down and down, wearily, 
thinking about how 1. have lost 
some darling, but not what or 
who — 1 don’t remember. 

It’s bright day when I’m wakened 
by voices joining and separating in 
some conversation, piercing the 
clear, icy air. I lift my head and see 
our group standing together. I slide 
out of my bed and stamp into my 
boots, which are cold, and walk 
over to the group. Moshe, who was 
a little contemptuous, is lying on 
the ground, quite dead. 

Bern and Hagne carry him off the 
trail and lay him in a fold between 
rocks. Above us the mountain 



looms greenish black. We surround 
the campfire and eat our morning 
meal, then all take part in packing 
up the gear. It’s not expected of us 
but all along we’ve liked to do our 
part. It seems to come natural on a 
trip like this. 

When we have put on our packs 
we start upward. Moshe’s long, thin 
figure lying between the rocks soon 
disappears like yesterday behind us. 
The air gets colder. It seems to get 
paler, too, though the sun is strong. 

After the first hour we stop for a 
short rest, gathering together to 
look back down the long slopes 
we’ve climbed. Then each of us 
looks over a shoulder, looks up- 
ward, cranes, stares, lowers eyes 
from that peak. I do this, too, com- 
paring the climb behind me to the 
one ahead, comparing how it ad- 
vances before us to how our day’s 
work vanishes behind. 

“A beautiful day,” Alma says. 

“Perfect. Just the day for a hike,” 
Hanson agrees. 

“Let’s go, then,” Bern says and 
Hagne walks down to the end of 
our line to watch over us. 

In places we’re able to walk two 
or three abreast and exchange a few 
words, but more often we have to 
go one at a time, and we encounter 
some steep parts where we must lie 
almost flat along the rock and grip 
with toes and fingers, pull and push, 
feel ourselves glow, our blood run 
furiously. Then again we come to a 
dell or flatfish spot where for a time 
we can move easily. It is at the end

of one of these places and starting a 
harder slope that I notice Pernt 
Yoilo fling a hand out behind him, 
as if throwing something away. 
Whatever it is, it gives a fiery glitter 
in the air and goes. 

Bern Benn is already at the top of 
the next rock face, waiting for us 
one by one to join him. 1, Tarrold, 
and Kissie, with Hagne behind us, 
cross the open space, as Pernt 
comes to the rock. He puts both 
hands flat against it, gently, then 
his face. Then he slips down and lies 
still. He will not use any more of 
our emergency oxygen. 

Bern slides down the rock, 
braking himself with his boots. He 
looks questioningly around. We 
had seen nothing. It just happened. 

“Let’s go on,” Bern Benn says. 

And behind us Hagne Benn says, 
“Let’s go!” 

W E STOP in a while for our 
noon meal. The ground is all 
rock — dark, glittering, hard as iron. 
We’re eating and resting when a 
noise begins in the distance. We’re 
so startled by the familiar sound 
that we duplicate each other’s ges- 
tures. Hands full of food pause in 
mid-air, heads tilt back, eyes look 
up. 

A fleet of bright green merchant 
ships. The world becomes familiar 
as they pass over. Nothing is 
strange any more — home is almost 
just around the corner. We’re able 
to get a strong grip on our identities 
without understanding how close 



we must have come to losing our- 
selves on the climb. Although, after 
all, that’s what a vacation is for, at 
least to some degree. The ships 
disappear and soon their sound is 
gone, too. We finish eating, loll at 
ease for a little while and then 
comes the usual call for us to go on. 

We’re commencing the final part 
of our hike. Tarrold moves up to 
my side and touches my shoulder. 
“Goodbye, Gaia,” he says and sits 
down where he is. He will not 
despair again, or try to share that 
shame. 

“Goodbye,” I say. When I look 
down from the next steepness he’s 
lying curled up on the rock, and 
frost has already formed a web of 
white lace over him. 

Bern loosens his rope and we use 
it to help us up. Kissie nearly floats 
free at one point, like a weed seed, 
light in the air. But she gives her 
laugh, clings to a spike and goes up, 
over the top beside Bern and 
Hanson, and the rest of us bend our 
heads and pull and push. At the rate 
we’re going it will be close to dark 
when we get up there and that 
would be too bad, for we’ve been 
told about and promised as fine a 
view as we’ve ever seen. 

“Can we make it in time?” Sonol 
asks. Bern smiles and says, “Yes, if 
you’ll put a little extra into it. We 
have some hours of daylight left. 
But no fooling around if you want 
to see it all from the top before 
tomorrow.” 

After that there’s no stopping.

We heave ourselves up, burn our 
hands on the rope, scrape our knees 
on the rock, grow thirsty, hungry, 
tired, and each one of us gives up 
looking back or even looking 
ahead. * 

Up there Bern Benn encourages 
us with shouts of, “Let’s go on, 
then!” And behind us Hagne 
coaxes, “Go on, go on!” I suppose 
one of the few thoughts we have is 
that we’re lucky to be with those 
two, who know what they’re doing 
and can help us. 

The last towering mass looms 
over us. We stop involuntarily, 
every one of us, for a moment, to 
look up. It’s very still up there. It 
seems to be absolutely silent. The 
silence is an enormous mass that 
waits for us. 

“Let’s go.” 

“Go on, then.” 

Up we go, bruised legs throbbing, 
hands half frozen and cramped into 
grabbing shapes as we take advan- 
tage of every crevice and bulge for 
a better hold, a safer grip. Bern 
vanishes into the silence. Then 
Alma. Then Hanson. Up we go. 

One by one, over the last rock at 
the top. 

“Surprise!” 

“Happy holiday hikers!” 

“Vacation’s over!” 

“Welcome! Surprise! Happy 
hiking!” 

Oh, the funny people in their 
shiny hats, the dear, comical 
dancers and acrobats, all jumping 
up and down and turning somer- 



saults in the air on top of the moun- 
tain. Red and yellow streamers 
float and fall over our heads. 
Noisemakers, firecrackers, con- 
fetti, the popping of corks from 
wine bottles, kazoos, surprise! 

Bern and Hagne lock arms and 
dance, Sonol and Kissie with some 
of the others weave in and out in a 
jiggling line. We all get caught up in 
the celebration, tossing our boots 
into the air, throwing our canteens 
down off the rocks. Everyone does 
split jumps and yodels— everyone 
shouts, swigs from the bottles, 
throws paper flowers at his neigh- 
bor. As I join hands with a funny 
little woman who has a purple nose, 
somewhere off on the far side of the 
gallivanting group I see a face that 
reminds me I have lost my most 
precious and most dear, but the 
reddled old woman pulls my hand. 

She cries, “Come on, Gaia, you 
want to dance?” 

Hagne cries, “Come on, let’s 
go!” 

My feet begin to stutter and 
jump. Someone passes me a bottle 
and even while I dance I take a 
great mouthful. Oh, it’s fine, won- 
derful — my nose turns purple and 
the veins bulge in my legs — we’re 
all wonderful people in our conical 
hats. Everyone shrieks with laugh- 
ter and approval. It’s marvelous. 
A journey is completed once 
again and once again we’re with our 
friends and peers. Those of us who 
deserve it are celebrating another 
success. it

BOOKSHELF 



I T IS always a pleasure to drop 
once again into what I call the 
“peripherals” — books forwarded to 
me largely because the various (and 
believe me, they are various) 
powers-that-be just don’t know 
what else to do with them. When 
they aren’t mainstream of any 
kind, or western/detecli ve/pornog- 
raphy/kiddies/politicals et some 
other cetera, these “different” 
books have practically no good 
chance for review. So off they go to 
the sci-fantasy slot — sometimes, 
one is sure, as a conscience-freeing 
substitute for the incinerator for 
people who wouldn’t think of burn- 
ing a book. And sometimes in the 
hope that maybe, after all, the 
science-fiction reviewer might dis- 
cover what the book really is and 
maybe that it even has merit. And 
that’s good. The most original 
thought comes always from the 
frowing edge (even if the best art 
does but rarely); discoveres and re- 
discoveries are most often random 



dots around and ahead of that well- 
scored curve on the graph before 
they become large or numerous 
enough to divert the line and be in- 
cluded in someone’s category. “Pe- 
ripherals” is all the categorization I 
accept willingly anyway — sticking 
things into cubbyholes is the most 
damaging preoccupation of our 
modern psyche and I hate it a lot. 
Hence a report like this. 

The Book of Strangers, by Ian 
Dallas (Pantheon, S4.9S) has a 
novelistic icing for a rather unusual 
(in Western culture) How-I-Was- 
Saved cake. The icing was what 
sent it to my desk — the protagonist 
is a specialist in a State Library at a 
near-future time when books have 
all but disappeared in favor of mi- 
crofilm and computer-retrieval. To 
search for a book he secures a leave 
of absence, learns through a series 
of encounters on his journey that 
the book is its writer and the writer 
is himself — a sequence which was, 
in substance, old before Candide. 



169 



The cake under the icing will not be 
to everyone’s taste, for it deals with 
enlightenment of Islam and Sufism 
and how it feels to be bathed in the 
inner radiance pouring from an end- 
less succession of holy masters in 
beggars’ rags. There is a humorless 
breathlessness in the style and a 
hunger for personal subjugation, 
which I find abrasive. Maybe you 
won’t. 

nASSPORT to the Supernat- 
Rural, by Bernhardt J. Hurwood, 
(Taplinger, $7.50) is subtitled “An 
Occult Compendium from All Ages 
and Many Lands’’ and earns a per- 
manent place in my Where Do You 
Get Your Ideas? file. Part scholarly 
treatise, part anthology of weird, 
horror and ghost stories, the book 
is a journey of adventure and dis- 
covery on many levels. We in sf 
have been called the mythmakers of 
our time. All times and all cultures 
have produced theirs and it is aston- 
ishing to see both the similarities 
and the differences between stories 
whose sources are widely separated 
in space and time. Siberians and 
Persians, Chinese and English, an- 
cient and modern, have fabled the 
hours and centuries away to teach 
and to entertain — and the stories 
they tell, the truths they illustrate, 
say much about the human condi- 
tion as it remains the same (in 
preoccupations with love, death. 



fear and laughter) and as it changes 
from time to time, from place to 
place. Put a Malayan underworld 
side by side with Dante’s, for 
example, or the were-fox of China 
with the tiger of Siam and the wolf 
of Transylvania, and you will be 
overwhelmed by the fellowship of 
people everywhere, everywhen. 
There’s something here that is, I 
think, profoundly important — 
something that cannot be dismissed 
by proclaiming that of course it’s 
nice to be safe and warm under the 
blankets while engrossed in tales of 
someone else’s terror and torture 
and to be deliciously menaced by 
the Shadow Under the Bed — it 
makes one safer and warmer. Don’t 
deny this — accept it and go on. And 
then begin to wonder about pat- 
terns, about why so many story- 
tellers in so many lands and times 
have pointed so strongly to certain 
areas: to powers beyond our com- 
prehension, life after death, alien 
entities with superior knowledge 
and abilities. Reduce these yet 
again to some kind of denominator 
and you’ll find that the underlying 
statement is that there is more be- 
yond, that there are power sources 
known to certain individuals and 
entities, whether it be a were- 
maiden to come to your bed 
(Chinese) or the skull of a mur- 
dered woman that will, in ven- 
geance, go for your throat (Eng-

lish). Virtually all these tales are 
proclamations of the existence of 
' p/uj (And so is the bulk of sf.) 

! For every thousand tales that 
make this proclamation there is 
perhaps one that makes an effort to 
explain it. For every thousand of 
these there is somewhat less than 
one that has no axe to grind — that 
^ does not say “The phenomena are 
I God’s and Jesus is the way,” or 
r “Allah’s” and “Islam. .” or “en- 
l gramic” and “Scientology. .” or 
I “History’s” and “Marx. .” Do 
; you know of one single book that 
i (a) accepts the existence of that

(b) makes a dispassionate, reason- 
; able and scientific inquiry into,

’• T KNOW one. Consciousness and 
f X Reality, subtitled “The Human 
Pivot Point,” edited by Charles 
Mus^s and Arthur M. Young, 
(Outerbridge and Lazard. S 10.00) 
is such a book, a book so provoca- 
^ tive, with spectrum so wide and 
levels so many and so deep, that 
to describe it adequately is 
quite impossible. 

First of all, the contributors to 
the volume (ten years in the 
making) carry heavy credentials. 
Dr. Muses is an associate editor of 
the Journal of Bio-Medical 
Computing (London) and editor of 
' the Journal for the Study of Con- 



sciousness. Arthur Young is a 
Name in aviaton history, having 
been a developer of the helicopter in 
the ’30s and ’40s. Here is a melding 
of mathematics and hard technol- 
ogy, philosophy and the sciences, 
poetrv and sharpest prose, usually 
found only in super-individuals like 
Bertrand Russell. Both highly ar- 
ticulate and meticulous thinkers. 
Muses and Young have gathered 
together an impressive display of 
original thinking. Skimming the 
long table of contents, we find such 
things as an eyewitness account of 
fire-walking in Ceylon, trance-in- 
duction techniques in ancient 
Egypt, a theory of ESP, recognition 
of reincarnation and the supraphys- 
ical body (fascinating, this one!) — 
then there are cases of hyperdimen- 
sional awareness, awareness in 
plants (J.C. Bose wrote this one) 
and the possible meaning of imagi- 
nary numbers. Nicole Maxwell 
writes an exciting and sensitive ac- 
count of her search for pharmaco- 
logically valuable plants among the 
South American Indians. William 
Ernest Hocking reflects on im- 
mortality, Joel Elkes on language 
and the psyche. Charles Lind- 
bergh’s essay on human potential is 
beautifully written and a splendid 
statement of one man’s evolution of 
mind and convictions. Kenneth 
Demarest, using a large collection 
of illustrations from the far past.

delineates “New discoveries of an 
ancient path to enlightenment and 
regeneration.” . .In reading over 
the above partial list, I feel a kind 
of despair. Kmust assure you that 
this is not a compendium of 
kookery like flying saucer contact 
claims, but a wide-ranging anthol- 
ogy of serious and significant 
thought — and that it won’t be be- 
yond my arm’s reach as long as I 
have one. 

W ’lTH the possible exception 
of Arthur Clarke, there is no 
one alive who writes more 
knowledgeably and more lucidly on 
aerospace than Martin Caiden. Or 
just more, for that matter. His new 
book (Destination Mars, Dou- 
bleday, $7.95) lists 55 non-fiction 
books and eleven novels (one of 
which is Marooned, which you may 
have seen as a movie, and another 
of which is, I’m told, destined for 
the screen and a TV series, called 
Cyborg.) Years ago he held me en- 
tranced with his appearance on all- 
night radio in New York. He 
knows and loves flying and space 
and their technology. His personal 
opinions are strong and clear and 
invariably well-grounded. His new 
Mars book is a real achievement, 
for it is not only a documentation of 
the effort to reach the red planet 
and an intriguing study of the 
strange globe itself, but a structured 



piece of excellent and compelling 
prose. He takes you through each 
phase of Mars exploration with a 
marvelous gift for immediacy. It’s 
like reading, say, an account of one 
of Magellan’s voyages, not from 
the altitude of one who knows it all 
and how it came out, but with the 
viewpoint of a day to day, week by 
week participant in the excitement 
and the discovery as well as 
the challenge and the wonder. 

No more meticulous account of 
Mars and the Mars effort exists for 
the interested lay reader. Although 
we are into an explosion of new 
concepts in sf and new ways of ex- 
ploiting them (a development I 
heartily welcome and applaud), the 
old hard-core sf is not dead — and 
may it live forever. A book like 
Caiden’s is wanted and needed for 
this and I recommend it most 
highly for readers and writers alike. 



AND I’ll end this account of un- 
usual books with George 
Alec Effinger’s What Entropy 
Means to Me (Doubleday, $4.95.) 
Years ago Philip Wylie write Finn- 
ley Wren and called it “a novel in 
a new manner” — and indeed it was. 
And so (without being the least like 
Wylie’s) is Effinger’s odd book. 
Frankly, 1 don’t know what to 
make of it — and yet 1 must recom- 
mend it, for it is written well and in

some parts beautifully. It is saved 
from being “special” or precious by 
its wonderful whimsy, its deftness. 
It has about as many levels as any 
reader is capable of finding in it, 
probably a few known only to the 
author. Clearly he had a ball writ- 
ing it and he shares his joy gener- 
ously. To ask me to report accu- 
rately on it is to hand me mallet and 
chisels and a block of granite and 
ask me to do you a soap-bubble. I 
can say that the narrator, Seyt, who 
lives on some kind of Earth — which 
is not this one, but something very 
like it in a number of appalling 
ways — has the duty of writing an 



account of his brother Dore’s quest. 
This quest is to go to the source of a 
River at which entropy itself can be 
found. Since Dore never comes 
back, Seyt must make up the nar- 
rative out of his head, with his innu- 
merable family (and a weirder col- 
lection of weirdos you have never 
encountered) kibitzing every word 
he writes, as he writes it. Dore 
meets this Glorian, who becomes 
his companion, helps him lose his 
sword, pursue and find it again, and 
who often turns out to be someone 
else. Well, finally they arrive at the 
end of the River, where — oh, hell. 
Try it. You’ll like it. ★

those remaining were still blue. 
Astern, dim and distant, the Rim 
Stars reappeared. 

And the figures in the screen were 
now in red light; 999999... 999998... 
999997... 

“Sir.” Willoughby, the chief of- 
ficer was pointing. Out to star- 
board, just abaft the beam, was a 
star where no star should or could 
be — a point of greenish radiance 
that steadily brightened. 

“Captain! Commodore!” It was 
Madam Swithin’s voice. What the 
hell was she doing in the control 
room? 

“Mr. Wallasey,” said Listowel to 
his third officer, “please escort this 
lady down to her cabin.” 

“But, Captain,” cried the mis- 



( Continued from page 137) 
sionary, “this is most important.” 
“So is that,” he said, pointing. 
“I’ve no time to spare for — ” 
“That,” she interrupted him, “is 
what is important.” 

“Mr. Wallasey — ” began Lis- 
towel. 

“Let her stay,” said Sonya 
sharply. It was more of an order 
than a request. “Let her stay.” 

The young officer looked uncer- 
tainly at his Captain, at the com- 
modore, at the commodore’s wife. 
He looked again, questioningly, 
toward Listowel. But the master’s 
full attention was on the strange 
light. It was closing on a converging 
course. And there was something 
solid, or apparently solid, in the 
center of that glowing circle of 



173 



blue-green mist. A ship? Grimes 
had found a pair of binoculars, had 
them to his eyes. 

Yes, a ship. 

M adam swithin was 

speaking again, but the voice 
was not her own. It was male and 
had a strange, guttural accent. And 
the language was one that Grimes 
did not understand, although it 
seemed to be of Terran origin. 
German? No, he decided. Although 
there were similarities. 

“Who are you?” Sonya was 
asking. “Speak so that we may 
understand.” 

“I can not rest. 1 must not rest. 
Effer. To sail der seas vas 1 con- 
demned, for all eternity, vhereffer 
and vheneffer dere are ships — ” 

The seas? wondered Grimes. But 
space is a sea... 

He could make out the hull now 
through his glasses — high-pooped, 
with a tall forecastle. He could see 
the line of black-gaping gunports 
and the three masts with the square 
sails at fore and main, the staysails 
and the spritsail, the lateen sail at 
the mizzen... 

This was no lightjammer. 
“Kapitan!” that deep, urgent 
voice was commanding, “Star- 
board der helm! Starboard der 
helm!” 

But an alteration of course to 
starboard would make a collision 
between Pamir and this apparition 
inevitable. 

“Kapitan! Starboard der helm!” 



And in the old days when the 
helm, the tiller, had been put to 
starboard both rudder and ship had 
turned to port. Grimes remembered 
from his reading. Even after the in- 
vention and introduction of the 
ship’s wheel those topsy-turvey 
steering orders had persisted for 
quite a long while. 

In the old days, the days of the 
windjammers. 

And hadn’t there been a legend 
about a Captain Van... What was 
his name? A Dutchman? 

He laughed softly. “A ghost,” he 
murmured. “A ghost.” 

Listowel laughed with him. “A 
bloody Rim Ghost. 1 should have 
known. I’ve heard enough about 
them. Phantom ships from al- 
ternate universes — ” 

“Kapitan! For der luff of Gott, 
starboard!” 

Listowel laughed again, con- 
temptuously, “That thing can’t hurt 
us. I’ll not risk my spars and sails, 
my ship, for a silly, blown-away 
phantasm!” 

A spurt of orange flame leaped 
from the archaic ship’s forward 
gunport, followed by billowing 
dirty white smoke. The Dutchman 
had fired a warning shot. 

“Listowel, bring her around to 
port at once,” ordered Grimes. 

“I’m not running from a ghost 
ship with ghost cannon. Commo- 
dore.” 

“Bring her around, damn you!” 

“And you can’t order me in my 
own control room — ”

GALAXY 



“Legally 1 can’t — but I do order 
you.’’ Had Grimes known how to 
handle the lightjammer he would 
have tried to push the younger man 
from the controls. But he did not 
know. The only thing in his mind 
that could be of value in this situa- 
tion was his memory of the old 
sailors’ tales. 

“Kapitan! Starboard der helm!” 
It was a depairing cry in that 
strange male voice from the lips of 
the medium. 

“He’s warning us, Listowel!” 
cried Grimes. “The old legends — 
you’ve read them. I’ve seen your 
bookshelf. The appearance of the 
Flying Dutchman before disaster... 
The ships Vanderdecken were saved 
from disaster by a ghost ship’s 
warning! Come to port, Captain! 
Bring her around to port!” 

Realization dawned on Listowel’s 
face. With a muttered oath he drop- 
ped his hands to the console. He 
worked fast now that it was almost 
too late — with desperate urgency. 
He trimmed the east sails, not bo- 
thering about precise angles, 
bringing all five of the great vanes 
around as fast as the trimming mo- 
tors would let him, presenting their 
light-absorptive surfaces to the ra- 
diation of the Llanith sun. Pamir 
lurched as she fell off to port. The 
mast whipped violently and the 
royal was ripped from its yards, 
flapped ahead and away from the 
ship like a bat into hell. But the rest 
held as the ship pivoted about her 
short axis. 



And Grimes, looking out to star- 
board, saw the Dutchman vanish 
like a snuffed candle — but not be- 
fore he had glimpsed the tall figure 
on the poop, his long beard stream- 
ing in the wind (here, in inter- 
stellar space, where there were no 
winds but the star winds!), his right 
arm raised in a gesture of farewell. 

“Well,” muttered Listowel shak- 
ily. “Well—” Then: “Is it all 
right for us to resume course. 
Commodore?” 

“1 — 1 suppose so,” replied 
Grimes. In a stronger voice he said, 
“I shall ground the lightjammers 
until a thorough survey has been 
made of this sector of space. There 
was something there. Something we 
just missed.” 

On the deck where she had fallen, 
where Sonya was supporting her 
head and shoulders. Madam 
Swithin began to stir. Her eyes 
opened, stared around her. “Where 
am 1? What happened? How did I 
get here? 1 came all over queer and 
1 don’t remember any more — ” 

“Everything is all right,” Sonya 
told her. 

“Thank you, dear. Thank you. I 
shall be feeling better in a couple of 
jiffs. But I’d be ever so grateful if 
somebody could bring me a nice 
cup of — ” The expression faded 
from her plump face and her eyes 
went vacant. That strange male 
voice — although now little more 
than a dying whisper — finished the 
sentence. 

“ — Holland gin,” it said. *
