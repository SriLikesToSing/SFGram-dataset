TRICKS AND TREATS 



T he other day we were asked to 
talk to a group of management 
types about The Future of Every- 
thing. In the course of niaking some 
remarks about probabilistic mathe- 
matics we discovered we had invent- 
ed a new magic trick, which we 
pass on to you now. It has to do 
with calculating the results of flipping 
coins. 

First we draw you a picture of a 
single coin: 

O 

If you flip it, there are two pos- 
sible results: It can come up either 
heads or tails. If we flip two coins: 
OO 

there are four possible results: heads- 
heads; heads-tails; tails-tahs; tails- 
heads. If you flip three coins there 
are eight possible results, and so on. 

The trick is this. You draw a row 
of as many coins as you like — two, 
three, a hundred, a googolplex of 
coins: 

OOOOO . OO 
And we undertake to write down, 
in ten seconds or less, the exact 
number of possible results of flipping 
that many coins. And, just to make 
it harder, we undertake to do so 
even if you cover up all the coins 
but the first, so we can’t count them. 

N ow, obviously there is a trick 
involved. If you want to see 
what the trick is, you’re welcome to 
hunt around in this issue for the 
answer; we’ll print it at the bottom 
of a page somewhere. But then come 
back, please, because we’d like to 



talk for a > minute about “tricks.” 

A “trick” may be aefined as that 
solution to a problem which causes 
an observer to say, once he sees how 
the solution is obtained: “Oh, I didn’t 
know you meant to do it that way.” 
That’s what the Spanish nobles said 
when Columbus stood the egg on 
end; that’s what your friends will 
say if you elect to do this coin-tossing 
trick for them. 

It is also what scientists say when 
somebody does something which is 
defined as impossible. Create or des- 
troy matter? Impossible, said the 
19th-century mechanistic physicists; 
and along came Einsteih and Fermi 
and Hahn and showed that matter 
could be transformed into energy, 
and the other way around; and, 
“Oh,” said the last of the mechanists, 
“I didn’t know you meant to do it 
that way.” Select the sex of a child 
in advance? Impossible. Except, of 
course, that you can do it by means 
of a trick: you remove a fertilized 
ovum, examine the cells to see which 
sex it is; if the right one, you re- 
implant it and let it come to term; 
if wrong, you throw it away and 
try again. (“Oh, you mean that 
way.”) Put Maxwell’s demon to 
work and sort out the hot air from 
the cold in a stream of gas? Impossi- 
ble. Except by means of a Hilsch 
tube, which will deliver hot gas 
from one vent and cold from an- 
other as long as you keep pumping 
gas through it. (“Oh.”) And so on. 

It is true that all these solutions 
are tricks, in that they do not solve

so horrible —and 
so completely

medical science 
is afraid to 
contemplate its 
consequences 



A novel by MARTIN CAIDIN 

On Space Station Epsilon, a mysterious illness is killing off the scientists 
who man the station. 

Should those still alive he brought back to Earth and risk infecting all 
human life — or be sacrificed in an orbiting tomb? 

On Earth, medical science is helpless. Terrified people are rioting, protesting 
the space ship's return. Official Washington is torn by the desperate 
dilemma. On Space Station Epsilon no one knows what his fate Will be. 

" . thrilling moments. Caidin writes well and with imagination," 
says Publishers' Weekly. In FOUR CAME BACK the award-winning master 
of space-age science-fiction has turned out a great story— fiction with the 
frightening ring of scientific possibility, not in 2100 but in the 1970s.

the stated problem in the unspoken 
context in ^hich it was conceived. 
They change the context on you, 
which is manifestly unfair, and prob- 
ably also destructive of those good 
solid values on which second-rate 
reputations are based. 

First-rate reputations, however, are 
based on other kinds of values; they 
depend very often on enlarging con- 
texts. Newton enlarged the context 
of problems involving a planet’s or- 
bit and an apple’s fall with his theory 
of universal gravitation. Einstein en- 
larged the contexts again, so that 
Newton’s world-view became only 
one special case in an infinitely 
larger system of references. 

It is a good gambling bet that any 
physical problem which can be 
shown to have no possible solution 
(traveling through time, exceeding 
the speed of light, you name it) is 
likely to turn out to be merely an- 
other example of a problem which 
was framed according to narrowly 
construed contexts. That is to say, 
the reason you can’t get an answer 
is because you’ve had the bad luck 
to ask the wrong question. (We said 
“physical” problems. It is true that 
certain mathematical problems do 
have no possible solution; but mathe- 
matical problems are by definition 
meaningless outside their own con- 
texts; the rules of mathematics are 
essential parts of the problems.) 

Travel through time? Certainly it’s 
impossible; no one can even suggest 
a possible way of attacking that 
problem, much less a solution for it. 
As of this hour of this day. Yet it 
has been shown that it is possible to 
write a mathematical description of 
the behavior of nuclear particles on 



the assumption that some of Aem 
(the positron, other “anti-particles”) 
are merely standard particles which 
happen to be traveling backward 
through time. Do they really go 
backward through time? That’s a 
hard question; it depends, you might 
say, on what you mean by “really”. 

Go faster than light? Enpossible. 
Yet Gerald Feinberg has his own 
mathematical description of the 
world in which there are entire 
classes of things which have c as a 
limiting velocity — but as a lower 
limit; they cannot go as slow as 
light. Do these things “really” exist? 

I t is considered bad form in this 
hard-headed day to invoke faith 
as an answer to a challenge. But we 
have always been guilty of bad form 
when we felt it to be good sense; and 
we do have faith. We have faith that 
the contexts in which the basic laws 
of the universe are formed are rather 
larger than human beings as yet un- 
derstand and faith that there will 
always be an end-run that is possible 
around even the most formidable 
“proof” of impossibility. 

We even have faith that, sooner or 
later, we (or our descendants) will 
be catehing the 4:15 Feinberg Drive 
spaceship to Rigel VII, arriving 
twenty-five minutes later in time for 
tea. Impossible? Of course it was 
impossible, the conservatives will 
say; we didn’t know that you meant 
to do it that way. 

They may even say, “Why, that’s 
only a trick.” And maybe they’ll be 
right. But meanwhile we’ll be there 
on Rigel VII, laughing merrily, on 
our way to explore the universe.

D eep in cryogenic sleep tiie 
mind dreams the same froz-

through the long empty years. 
Sidney Lee dreamed of the tow- 



ers on Titan, over and again, their 
smooth blank walls of metal that 
was beyond metal, their throb- 
bing, ceaseless, purposeful ma- 
chines that ran at tasks that 
men could not even guess at. The 
towers loomed in his darkened

dreams, standing menacing and 
alien above the frozen wastes of 
Titan, utterly unmindful of tfie 
tiny men that groveled at their 
base. He tried to scale those 
smooth, steep walls and fell back. 
He tried to penetrate them and 
failed. He tried to scream. And 
in his dreams, at least, He suc- 
ceeded. 

He didn’t dream of Ruth, or 
of the stars, or of the future or 
the past. Only of the towers, of 
the machines that blindly obey- 
ed a builder who had left Earth’s 
solar system countless millenia 
ago. 

H e opened His eyes. 

“What happened?” 

Carlos Pascual was smiling 
down at him, his round dark- 
skinned face relaxed and almost 
happy. “We are there . here, 
I mean. We are braking, prepar- 
ing to go into orbit.” 

Lee blinked and sat up. “We 
made it?” 

“Yes, yes,” Pascual answered 
softly as his eyes shifted to the 
bank of instruments on the con- 
sole behind Lee’s shoulder. “The 
panel claims you are alive and 
well. How do you feel?” 

That took a moment’s thought. 
“A little hungry.” 

“A common reaction.” The 
smile returned. “You can join the 
others in the galley.”

It's a great, big, beautiful world, 
(disregarding tfie elections where 
just about everybody was a born 
loser anyway — especially the 
voters.) In our last ad, we mention- 
ed something about your glorious 
future. Starting with February pub- 
lications, BB will be doing two s.f.'s 
and/or fantasy titles a month, plus 
block reissues of oldtime goodies, 
plus (you all, by now, know of this 
but it delights us so) Walker & Co., 
displaying remarkable editorial 
acumen, has selected several BB 
titles for reissue in hardcover. Not 
only that, they are doing Spinrad's 
BUG J.B. which proves their in- 
terest in s.f. is serious. Support 
them, fans. It may just be that, 
with s.f. and Walker's help. 
Recognition is about to dawn in 
the misty logic of the laggard 
mainstream. It's debatable, of 
course, but kindness must assume 
that the literati will eventually stop 
navel-gazing and find out where 
the real action is at. For their 
sakes, we keep hoping, and mean- 
time let us not be churlish. Inciden- 
tally, back at the Bay-Con, did 
anyone notice the local news write- 
ups on what was of interest to s.f. 
people (economics, riots, cultural

conditions, sexuai relations, the 
population explosion, politics, the 
space program, etc. etc.) and what 
was apparently the main concern 
at the psychologists' convention? 
Fascinating contrast.

order any BB titles on the above 
subjects, we're at the same old 
stand — Dept. GCS, 101 Fifth Ave-

helped Lee to swing his legs over 
the edge of the couch, then left 
him and went to the next unitj 
where a blonde woman lay still 
sleeping. With an effort, Lee re- 
called her: Doris McNertny, pri- 
mary biologist, backup biochem- 
ist. Lee pulled a deep breath in- 
to his lungs and tried to get him- 
self started. The overhead light 
panels, on full intensity now, 
made him want to squint. 

Standing was something of an 
experiment. No shakes, Lee 
thought gratefully. The room was 
large and circular, with no view- 
ports. 

Each of the twenty Hiber- 
nation couches had been painted 
a different color by some psychol- 
ogy team back on Earth. Most of 
them were empty now. The re- 
maining occupied ones had their 
lids off and the lifesystem con- 
nections removed as Pascual, 
Tanaka and May Connearney 
worked to revive the people. De- 
spite the color scheme, the room 
looked uninviting, and it smelled 
clinical. 

The galley, Lee focused his 
thoughts, is in this globe, one 
flight up. The ship was built ifl 
globular sections that turned in 
response to g-pulls. With the 
main fusion engines firing to 
brake their approach to final or- 
bit, “up” was temporarily in the 
direction of the engines’ thrust- 
ors. 



GALAXY 



But inside the globes it did 
not make much difference. 

He found the stairwell that 
ran through the globe. Inside the 
winding metal ladderway the 
rumbling vibrations from the 
ship’s engines were echoing 
strongly enough to hear as actual 
sound. 

“Sid! Good morning!” Aaron 
Hatfield had stationed himself at 
the entrance to the galley and 
was acting as a one-man welcom- 
ing committee. 

There were only a halfdozen 
people in the galley. Of course, 
Lee realized. The crew personnel 
are at their stations. Except for 
Hatfield, the people were bunch- 
ed at the galley’s lone viewpoint, 
staring outside and speaking in 
hushed, subdued whispers. 

“Hello, Aaron.” Lee didn’t feel 
jubilant, not after a fifteen-year 
sleep. He tried to picture Ruth 
in his mind and found that he 
couldn’t. 

She must be nearly fifty by 
now. 

Hatfield took his arm and tow- 
ed him to the dispenser counter. 
“Coffee, spirits, adrenalin . 
take your pick.” 

Hatfield was the expedition’s 
primary biochemist, a chunky, 
loud-speaking overgrown kid 
whom it was impossible to dis- 
like, no matter how he behaved. 
Lee knew that Hatfield wouldn’t 
go near the viewport because the 
FOEMAN, WHERE DO YOU FLEE? 



sight of empty space terrified 
him. 

“Hey, here’s Doris!” Hatfield 
shouted to no one. He scuttled 
toward the entrance as she step- 
ped rather uncertainly into the 
galley. 

Lee dialed for coffee. With the 
hot cup in his hand he walked 
slowly toward the viewport. 

“Hello Dr. Lee,” Marlene Et- 
tinger said as he came up along- 
side her. The others at the view- 
port turned and muttered their 
greetings. 

“How close are we?” Lee asked. 

Charnovsky, the geologist, an- 
swered positively, “Two days be- 
fore we enter final orbit.” 

The stars crowded out the 
darkness beyond their viewsport: 
against the blackness like drop- 
lets from a paint spray. In the 
faint reflection of the port’s plas- 
tic, Lee could see six human faces 
looking lost and awed. 

Then the ship swung, ever so 
slightly, in response to some 
command from the crew and 
computers. A single star — close 
and blazingly powerful — slid 
into view, lancing painfully bril- 
liant light through the polarizing 
viewport. Lee snapped his eyes 
shut, but not before the glare 
burned its afterimage against his 
closed eyelids. They all ducked 
back instinctively. 

“Welcome to Sirius,” somebody 
said.

A /T an’s fligKt to tfie stars was 
made not in glory, but in 

fear. 

TKe buildings on Titan were 
clearly the work of an alien in- 
telligent race. No man could tell 
exactly How old they were, Kow 
long their baffling machines had 
been running, wKat their purpose 
was. Whoever Had built them had 
left the solar system hundreds of 
centuries ago. 

For the first time, men truly 
dreaded the stars. 

Still, they had to know, had 
to learn. Robot probes were sent 
to the nearest dozen stars, the 
farthest that man’s technology 
could reach. Nearly a generation 
passed on Earth before the faint 
signals from the probes returned. 
Seven of the stars had planets 
circling them. Of these, five pos- 
sessed Earthlike worlds. On four 
of them, some indications of life 
were found. Life, not intelligence. 
Long and hot were the debates 
about what to do next. Finally, 
manned expeditions were dis- 
patched to the Earthlike ones. 

Through it all, the machines 
on Titan hummed smoothly. 

tC^'T^hey should have named 
this Afierthou^t” 

Lee said to Chamovsky. (The 
ship’s official name was Carl 
Safari.)

“Hovj so?” the Russian mutter- 
ed as he pushed a pawn across 
the board between them. They 
were sitting in the pastel-lighted 
rec room. A few others were scat- 
tered around the semicircular 
room, reading, talking, dictating 
messages that wouldn’t get to 
Earth for more than eight years. 
Soft music purred in the back- 
ground. 

The Earthlike planet — Siriusi 
A-2 swung past the nearest view- 
port. The ship had been in orbit 
for nearly three weeks now and 
was rotating around its long axis 
to keep a half-g feeling of weight 
for the scientists. 

“We were sent Here as an af- 
terthought,” Lee continued. “No- 
body expects us to find anything. 
Most of the experts back on 
Earth didn’t really believe there 
could be an Earthlike planet 
around a blue star.” 

“They were correct,” CHarnov- 
sky said. “Your move.” 

Picture our solar system. Now 
replace the sun with Sirius A the 
Dog Star; a young, blue star, 
nearly twice as hot and big as the 
sun. Take away the planet Uran- 
us, nearly two billion kilometers 
from the sun, and replace it with 
the white dwarf Sirius B, the 
Pup: just as hot as Sirius A, but 
collapsed to a hundredth of a 
star’s ordinary size. Now sweep 
away all the planets between the 
Dog and the Pup except two: a 

GALAXY 



bald chunk of rock the size of 
Mercury orbiting some 100 million 
kilometers from A, and an Eartfi- 
sized planet some seven times 
farther out. 

Give the Earth-sized planet a 
cloud-sprinkled atmosphere, a 
few large seas, some wom-down 
mountain chains, and a thin ve- 
neer of simple green life clinging 
to its dusty surface. Finally, 
throw in one lone gas giant plan- 
et, far beyond the Pup, some 200 
billion kilometers from A. Add 
some meteoroids and comets and 
you have the Sirius system. 

Lehman, the psychiatrist, pull- 
ed up a webchair to the kibitzer’s 
position between Lee and Char- 
novsky. 

“Mind if I watch?” He was 
trim and athletic looking, kept 
himself tanned under the UV 
lights in the ship’s gym booth. 

Within minutes they were dis- 
cussing the chances of finding 
anything on the planet below 
them. 

“You sound terribly pessimis- 
tic,” the psychiatrist said. 

“The planet looks pessimistic,” 
Charnovsky replied. “It was 
scoured clean when Sirius B ex- 
ploded, and life has hardly had a 
chance to get started again on its 
surface.” 

“But it is Earthlike, isn’t it?” 

“Hah!” Charnovsky burst. “To 
a simple-minded robot it may 
seem Earthlike. The air is breath- 
FOEMAN, WHERE DO YOU FLEE? 



able. The chemical composition 
of the rocks is similar. But no 
man would call that desert an 
Earthlike world. There are no 
trees, no grasses, it’s too hot, the 
air is too dry. ...” 

“And the planet’s too young 
to have evolved an intellignt spe- 
cies,” Lee added, “which makes 
me the biggest afterthought of 
all.” 

“Well, there might be some- 
thing down there for an anth- 
ropologist to puzzle over,” Leh- 
man countered. “Things will lock 
better once we get down to the 
surface. I think we’re all getting 
a touch of cabin fever in here.” 

T)efore Lee could reply, Lou 
D’Orazio — the ship’s geo- 
physicist and cartographer — 
came bounding through the 
hatchway of the rec room and, 
taking advantage of the half- 
gravity, crossed to their chess 
table in two jumps. 

“Look at this!” 

He slapped a still-warm pho- 
tograph on the chess table, scat- 
tering pieces over the floor. 
Charnovsky swore something Sla- 
vic, and everyone in the room 
turned. 

It was one of the regular car- 
tographic photos, crisscrossed 
with grid lines. It showed the 
shoreline of one of the planet’s 
mini-oceans. A line of steep bluffs 
followed the shore.

“It looks like an ordinary . 

“Aspertti un momento . wait 
a minute . , see here.” D’Orazio 
pulled a magnifier from his cover- 
all pocket. “Look!” 

Lee peered into the magnifier. 
Fuzzy, wavering, gray .... 

“It looks like — ” 

Lehman said, “Whatever it is, 
it’s standing on two legs.” 

“It’s a man,” Charnovsky said 
flatly. 

Ill 

T7ithin minutes the whole sci- 
^ ^ entific staff had piled into 
the rec room and crowded around 
the table, together with all the 
crew members except the two on 
duty in the command globe. The 
ship’s automatic cameras took 
twenty more photographs of the 
area before their orbit carried 
them over the horizon from the 
spot. 

Five of the pictures showed the 
shadowy figure of a bipedal crea- 
ture. 

The spot was in darkness by 
the time their orbit carried them 
over it again. Infrared and radar 
sensors showed nothing. 

They squinted at the pictures, 
handed them from person to per- 
son, talked and argued and won- 
dered through two entire eight- 
hour shifts. Crewmen left for 
duty and returned again. The 
planet turned beneath them and 
14 



once again the shoreline was 
bathed in Sirius’s hot glow. But 
there was no trace of the human- 
oid. Neither the cameras, the 
manned telescopes, nor the other 
sensors could spot anything. 

One by one, men and women 
left the rec room, sleepy and 
talked out. Finally, only Lee, 
Charnovsky, Lehman and Cap- 
tain Rassmussen were left sitting 
at the chess table with the finger- 
grimed photos spread out before 
them. 

“They’re men,” Lee murmer- 
ed. “Erect bipedal men.” 

“It’s only one creature,” the 
captain said. “And all we know 
is that it looks like a man.” 
Rassmussen was tall, hamfist- 




GALAXY 




ed, rawboned, with a ruddy face 
that could look either elfin or 
Viking but nothing in-between. 
His voice, though, was thin and 
high. To the everlasting applause 
of all aboard, he had fought to 
get a five-year supply of beer 
brought along. Even now, he had 
a mug tightly wrapped in one big 
hand. 

“All right, they’re humanoids,” 
Lee conceded. “That’s close 
enough.” 

The captain hiked a shaggy 
eyebrow. “I don’t like jumping 
at shadows, you know. These pic- 
tures — ” 

“Men or not,” Charnovsky 
said, “we must land and investi- 
gate closely.” 



Lee glanced at Lehman, strad- 
dling a turned-around chair and 
resting his arms tiredly on the 
back. 

“Oh, we’ll investigate,” Rass- 
mussen agreed, “but not too fast. 
If they are an intelligent species 
of some kind, we’ve got to go 
gingerly. I’m under orders from 
the Council, you know.” 

“They haven’t tried to contact 
us,” Lee said. “That means they 
either don’t know we’re here, or 
they’re not interested, or — ” 

“Or what?” 

Lee knew How it would sound, 
but he said it anyway. “Or 
they’re waiting to get their, Hands 
on us.” 

Rassmussen laughed. “That 




FOEMAN, WHERE DO YOU FLEE?

sounds dramatic, sure enough.” 
“Really?” Lee heard his voice 
as though it were someone else’s. 
“Suppose the humanoids down 
there are from the same race 
that built the machines on Ti- 
tan?” 

( ( 'NT o n s e n s e,” Charnovsky 
^ blurted. “There are no 
cities down there, no sign what- 
ever of an advanced civilization.” 
The captain took a long swal- 
low of beer, then, “There is no 
sign of Earth’s civilization on the 
planet either, you know. Yet we 
are here, sme enough.” 

Lee’s insides were fluttering 
now. “If they are the ones who 
built on Titan . .” 

“It is still nonsense!” Charnov- 
sky insisted. “To assume that 
the first extraterrestrial creature 
resembling a man is a represen- 
tative of the race that visited the 
solar system hundreds of centur- 
ies ago . i . ridiculous! The sta- 
tistics alone put the idea in the 
realm of fantasy.” 

“Wait, there’s more to it,” Lee 
said. “Why would a visitor from 
another star go to the trouble to 
build a machine that works for 
centuries, without stopping?” 
They looked at him, waiting 
for him to answer his own ques- 
tion: Rassmussen with his Vik- 
ing’s craggy face, Charnovsky 
trying to puzzle it out in his 
own mind, Lehman calm and 
16 



half-amused. 

“The Titan buildings are more 
than alien,” Lee explained. 
“They’re hostile. That’s tny be- 
lief. Call it an assumption, a hy- 
pothesis. But I can’t envision an 
alien race building machinery like 
that except for an all-important 
purpose. That purpose was mili- 
tary.” 

Rassmussen looked truly puz- 
zled now. “Military? But who 
were they fighting?” 

“Us,” Lee answered. “A previ- 
ous civilization on Earth’. A cul- 
ture that arose before the Ice 
Ages, went into space, met an 
alien culture and was smashed 
in a war so badly that there’s no 
trace of it left.” 

Charnovsky’s face was redden- 
ing with the effort of staying 
quiet. 

“I know it’s conjecture,” Lee 
went on quietly, “but if there 
was a war between ancient man 
and the builders of the Titan ma- 
chines, then the two cultures must 
have arisen close enough to each 
other to make war possible. Wide- 
ly separated cultures can’t make 
war, they can only contact each 
other every few centuries or mil- 
lennia. The aliens had to come 
from a nearby star . like Siri- 
us.” 

“No, no, no!” Charnovsky slap- 
ped a hand on his thigh'. “It’s 
preposterous, unscientific! There 
is not one shred of evidence to 

GALAXY 



support this, this . pipedream!” 
But Rasmussen looked thought- 
ful. 

“Still ” 

“Still it is no nonsense,” Char- 
novsky repeated. “The planet 
down there holds no interstellar 
technology. If there ever was one, 
it was blasted away when Sirius 
B exploded. Whoever is down 
there, he has no cities, no electron- 
ic communications, no satellites in 
orbit, no cultivated fields, no an- 
imal herds . nothing!” 

“Then maybe he’s a visitor 
too,” Lee countered. 

“Whatever it is,” Rasmussen 
said, “it won’t do for us to go 
rushing in like berserkers. Sup- 
pose there’s a civilization down 
there that’s so advanced we sim- 
ply do not recognize it as such?” 

TT efore Charnovsky could reply, 
the captain went on, “We 
have plenty of time. We will get 
more data about surface con- 
ditions from the robot landers 
and do a good deal more studying 
and thinking about the entire 
problem. Then, if conditions war- 
rant it, we can land.” 

“But we don’t have time!” Lee 
snapped. Surprised at his own ve- 
hemence, he continued, “Five 
years is a grain of sand compared 
to the job ahead of us. We have 
to investigate a completely alien 
culture and determine what its 
attitude is toward us. Just learn- 
FOEMAN, WHERE DO YOU FLEE? 



ing the language might take five 
years all by itself.” 

Lehman smiled easily and said, 
“Sid, suppose you’re totally 
wrong about this, and whoever’s 
down there is simply a haranless 
savage. What would be the shock 
to his culture if we suddenly drop 
in on him?” 

“What’ll be the shock 1» our 
culture if I’m right?” 

Rassmussen drained his naug 
and banged it down on the eltess 
table. “This is getting us nowhere. 
We have not enough evidence to 
decide on an intelligent course 
of action. Personally, I’m in no 
hurry to go blimdering into a 
nest of unknowns. Not when we 
can learn safely from orbit. As 
long as the beer holds out, we go 
slow.” 

Lee pushed his chair back and 
stood up. “We won’t learn a 
damned thing from orbit. Not 
anything that counts. We’ve got 
to go down there and study them 
close up. And the sooner the 
better.” 

He turned and walked out of 
the rec room. Rassmussen’s spent 
half his life hauling scientists out 
to Titan and he can’t understand 
why we have to make the mos< 
of OUT time here, he raged to Barn- 
self. 

Halfway down the passageway 
to his quarters, he heard foot- 
steps padding behind him. He 
knew who it would be. Tumkkg, 

17 



he saw Lehman coming along to- 
ward him. 

“Sacking in?” the psychiatrist 
asked. 

“Aren’t you sleepy?” 

Completely bushed, now that 
you mention it.” 

“But you want to talk to me,” 
Lee said. 

Lehman shrugged. “No hurry,” 

With a shrug of his own, Lee 
resumed walking to his room. 
“Come on. I’m too worked up to 
sleep an 5 Tway.” 

A 11 the cubicles were more or 
less the same: a bunk, a 
desk, a film spool reader, a sani- 
tary closet. Lee took the webbed 
deskchair and let Lehman plop 
on the sighing air mattress of the 
bunk. 

“Do you really believe this 
hostile alien theory? Or are you 
just — ” 

Lee slouched down in his chair 
and interrupted. “Let’s not fool 
around. Rich'. You know about 
my breakdown on Titan and 
you’re worried about me.” 

“It’s my job to worry about 
everybody.” 

“I take my pills every day . 
to keep the paranoia away.” 

“That wasn’t the diagnosis of 
your case, as you’re perfectly well 
aware.” 

“So they called it something 
else. What’re you after. Rich? 
Want to test my reflexes while 
18 



I’m sleepy and my guard’s 
down?” 

Lehman smiled professionally. 
“Look Sid. You had a breakdown 
on Titan. You got over it. That’s 
finished.” 

Nodding grimly, Lee added, 
“Except that I think there might 
be aliens down there plotting 
against me.” 

“That could be nothing more 
than a subconscious attempt to 
increase the importance of the 
anthropology department,” Leh- 
man countered. 

“Crap” Lee said. “I came out 
here expecting something like 
this. Why do you think I fought 
my way onto this expedition? It 
wasni’t easy, after my break- 
down. I had to push ahead of a 
lot of former friends.” 

“And leave your wife.” 

“That’s right. Ruth divorced 
me for it. She’s getting all my 
accumulated dividends. She’ll die 
in comfort while we’re sleeping 
our way back home.” 

“But why?” Lehman asked. 
“Why should you give up every- 
thing — friends, wife, family, po- 
sition — to get out here?” 

Lee knew the answer, hesitated 
about putting it into words, then 
realized that Lehman knew it too. 
“Because I had to face it. had 
to do what I could to find out 
about those buildings on Titan.” 
“And that’s why you want to 
rush down and contact whoever 

GALAXY 




it is down there? Am I right?” 
“Right,” Lee said. He almost 
wanted to laugh. “I’m hoping 
they can tell me if I’m crazy or 
not.” 

IV 

Tt was three months before they 
landed. 

Rassmussen was thorough, pa- 
tient and stubborn. Unmanned 
landers sampled and tested sur- 
face conditions. Observation sat- 
ellites crisscrossed the planet at 
' the lowest possible altitudes — 
except for one thing that hung 
in synchronous orbit in the longi- 
tude of the spot where the first 
humanoid Had been found. 



FOEMAN, WHERE DO YOU FLEE? 



19 




That was the only place where 
Kumanoid life was seen, along 
that shoreline for a grand dis- 
tance of perhaps five kilometers. 
Nowhere else on the planet. 

Lee argued and swore and 
stormed at the delay. Rassmus- 
sen stayed firm. Only when he 
was satisfied that nothing more 
could be learned from orbit did 
he agree to land the ship. And 
still he sent clear word back to- 
ward Earth that he might be 
landing in a trap. 

The great ship settled slowly, 
almost delicately, on a hot tongue 
of fusion flame, and touched 
down on the western edge of a 
desert some 200 kilometers from 
the humanoid site. A range of 
rugged-looking hills separated 
them. The staff and crew cele- 
brated that night. The next 
morning, Lee, Charnovsky, Hat- 
field, Doris McNertny, Marlene 
Ettinger and Alicia Monteverdi 
moved to the ship’s “Sirius 
globe.” They were to be the expe- 
dition’s “outsiders,” the special- 
ists who would eventually live 
in the planetary environment. 
They represented anthropology, 
geology, biochemistry, botony, 
zoology and ecology, with back- 
up specialties in archeology, 
chemistry and paleontology. 

The Sirius globe held their lag- 
oratories, workrooms, equipment 
and living quarters. They were 
quarantined from the rest of the 
20 



ship’s staff and crew, the “insid- 
ers,” until the captain agreed that 
the surface conditions on the 
planet would be no threat to the 
rest of the expedition members. 
That would take two years, min- 
imum, Lee knew. 

Gradually, the “outsiders” be- 
gan to expose themselves to the 
local environment. They began to 
breathe the air, acquire the mi- 
crobes. Pascual and Tanaka 
made them sit in the medical ex- 
amination booths twice a day, 
and even checked them personal- 
ly every other day. The two 
M.D.’s wore disposable biosuits 
and worried expressions when they 
entered the Sirius globe. The med- 
ical computers compiled miles 
of data tapes on each of the six 
“outsiders,” but still Pascual’s 
normally pleasant face acquired 
a perpetual frown of anxiety 
about them. 

ttT just don’t like the idea of 
this damned armor,” Lee 
grumbled. 

He was already encased up to 
his neck in a gleaming white 
powersuit, the type that crew 
members wore when working out- 
side the ship in vacuum. Aaron 
Hatfield and Marlene Ettinger 
were helping to check all the 
seams and connections. A few 
feet away, in the cramped “lock- 
er room,” tiny Alicia Monteverdi 
looked as though she were being 

GALAXY 



swallowed by an oversized auto- 
maton; Cfiamovsky and Doris 
McNertny were cKecking Her suit. 

“It’s for your own protection,” 
Marlene told Lee in a tHroaty 
wHisper as sKe applied a test 
meter to tKe radio panel on bis 
suit’s cliest. “You and Alicia won 
tKe toss for the first trip out- 
side, but this is the price you 
must pay. Now be a good boy 
and don’t complain.” 

Lee had to grin. “Ja, Fraulein 
Schluemeisterein.” 

SKe looked up at him with a 
rueful smile, “Thank God you 
never Kad to carry on a conversa- 
tion in German.” 

Finally Lee and Alicia clumped 
through the double hatch’ into the 
airlock. It took another fifteen 
minutes for them to perform tKe 
final checkout, but at last they 
were ready. The outer KatcK slid 
back, and they started down the 
long ladder to the planet’s sur- 
face. The armored suits were 
equipped with muscle-amplifying 
power systems, so that even a 
girl as slim as Alicia could han- 
dle their bulk easily. 

Lee went down the ladder first 
and set foot on the ground. It was 
bare and dusty, the sky a red- 
dish haze. The grand adventure, 
Lee thought. All the expected big 
moments in Hie are Hops. A hot 
breeze Hummed in his earphones. 
It was early morning Sirius had 
not cleared the barren Horizon 
FOEMAN, WHERE DO YOU FLEE? 



yet, although the sky was fully 
bright. Despite the suit’s air- 
conditioning, Lee felt the Heat. 

He reached up a hand as Ali- 
cia climbed warily down the last 
few steps of the ladder. The plas- 
tic rungs gave imder the suit’s 
weight, then slowly straightened 
themselves when the weight was 
removed. 

“Well,” he said, looking at her 
wide-eyed face through the trans- 
parent helmet of her suit, “what 
do you think of it?” 

“It is hardly paradise, is it?” 

“Looks like it’s leaning the 
other way,” Lee said. 

^■y^hey explored — Lee and Ali- 
cia that first day, then the 
other outsiders, shuffling ponder- 
ously inside their armor. Lee 
chafed against the restriction of 
the power-suits, but Rassmussen 
insisted and would brook no ar- 
gument. They went timidly at 
first, never out of sight of the 
ship. Charnovsky chipped sam- 
ples from the rock outcroppings, 
while the others took air and 
soil samples, dug for water, 
searched for life. 

“The perfect landing site,” 
Doris complained after a hot, 
tedious day. “There’s no form of 
life bigger than a yeast mold 
within a hundred kilometers of 
here.” 

It was a hot world, a dry world, 
a brick-dust world where the sky 

21 



was always red. Sirius was a 
blowtorch searing down on them, 
too bright to look at even through 
the tinted visors of their suits. At 
night there was no moon to see, 
but the Pup bathed this world in 
a deathly bluish glow far bright- 
er yet colder than moonlight. The 
night sky was never truly dark, 
and only a few strong stars could 
be seen from the ground. 

Through it all, the robot satel- 
lites relayed more pictures) of the 
humanoids along the seacoast. 
They appeared almost every day, 
usually only briefly. Sometimes 
there were a few of them, some- 
times only one, once there were 
nearly a dozen. The highest-reso- 
lution photographs showed them 
to be human in size and build. 
But what their faces looked like, 
what they wore, what they were 
doing — all escaped the drone 
cameras. 

The robot landers, spotted in a 
dozen scattered locations within 
a thousand kilometers of the ship, 
faithfully recorded and trasmit- 
ted everything they were pro- 
gramed to look for. They sent 
pictures and chemical analyses of 
plant life and insects. But no 
higher animals. 

Alicia’s dark-eyed face took on 
a perpetually puzzled frown, Lee 
saw. “It makes no sense,” she 
would say. “There is nothing on 
this planet more advanced than 
insects . yet there are men. 
22 



It’s as though humans suddenly 
sprang up in the Silurian period 
on Earth. They can’t be here. I 
wish we could examine the life in 
the seas . perhaps that would 
tell us more.” 

“You mean those Humanoidg 
didn’t originate on this planet,” 
Lee said to her. 

She shook her head. “I don’t 
know. I don’t see how they could 
have. ...” 

V 

G radually they pushed their 
explorations further afield, 
beyond the ship’s limited hori- 
zon. In the motorized powersuits 
a man could cover more than a 
himdred kilometers a day, if he 
pushed it. Lee always headed 
toward the grizzled hills that sep- 
arated them from the seacoast. 
He helped the others to dig, to 
collect samples, but he always 
pointed them toward the sea. 

“The satellite pictures show 
some decent greenery on the sea- 
ward side of the hills,” he told 
Doris. “That’s where he should 
go.” 

Rassmussen wouldn’t move the 
ship. He wanted his base of op- 
erations, his link homeward, at 
least a hundred kilometers from 
the nearest possible threat. But 
finally he relaxed enough to al- 
low the scientists to go out over- 
night and take a look at the hills. 

GALAXY 



And maybe the coast, Lee add- 
ed silently to the captain’s orders. 

Rassmussen decided to let 
them use one of the ship’s two 
air-cushion vehicles. He assigned 
Jerry Grote, the chief engineer, 
and Chien Shu Li, electronics 
specialist, to handle the skimmer 
and take command of the trip. 
They would live in biosuits and 
remain inside the skimmer at all 
times. Lee, Marlene, Doris and 
Charnovsky made the trip; Grote 
did the driving and navigating, 
Chien handled communications 
and the computer. 

It took a full day’s drive to 
get to the hills. Grote, a lanky, 
lantern-jawed New Zealander, 
decided to camp at their base as 
night came on. 

“I thought you’d be a born 
mountaineer,” Lee poked at him. 

Grote leaned back in His pad- 
ded chair and planted a large 
sandled foot on the skimmer’s 
control panel. 

“I could climb those wrinkles 
out there in my sleep,” he said 
pleasantly. “But we’ve got to be 
careful of this nice, shiny vehicle.” 

From the driver’s compart- 
ment, Lee could see Marlene 
pushing forward toward them, 
squeezing between tHe racks of 
electronics gear that separated 
the forward compartment from 
the living and working quarters. 
Even in the drab coveralls, sHe 
showed a nice profile. 

FOEMAN, WHERE DO YOU FLEE? 



“1 would like to go outside,” 
she said to Grote. “We’ve been 
sitting all day like tourists in a 
shuttle.” 

Grote nodded. “I got to wear 
a hard suit, though.” 

“But — ” 

“Orders.” 

She glanced at Lee, then shrug- 
ged. “Very well.” 

“I’ll come with you,” Lee said. 

Squirming into the armored 
suits in the aft hatchway was ex- 
asperating, but at last they were 
ready and Lee opened the hatch. 
They stepped out across the tail 
fender of the skimmer and jump- 
ed to the dusty ground. 

“Being inside this is almost 
worse than being in the car,” 
Marlene said. 

They walked around the skim- 
mer. Lee watched His shadow 
lengthen as he placed the setting 
Sirius at his back. 

“Look . , . look!” 

TTe saw Marlene pointing and 
turned to follow Her gaze. 
The hills rising before them were 
dazzling with a million sparkling 
lights: red and blue and white 
and dazzling, shimmering lights 
as though a cascade of precious 
jewels were pouring down the 
hillside. 

“What is it?” Marlene’s voice 
sounded excited, thrilled, not the 
least afraid. 

Lee^tared at the shifting mul- 

23 



ticolored lights. It was like play- 
ing a lamp on cut crystal. He 
took a step toward tlie hills, then 
looked down to the ground. From 
inside the cumbersome suit, it 
was hard to see the ground close 
to your feet and Harder still to 
bend down and pick up anything. 

> But he squatted slowly and 
reached for a small stone. Getting 
up again, Lee held the stone high] 
enough for it to catch the fading 
rays of daylight. 

The rock glittered with a 
shower of varicolored sparkles. 

“They’re made of glass,” Lee 
said. 

Within minutes Chamovsky 
and the other “outsiders” were 
out of the ship to marvel at it. 
The Russian collected as many 
rocks as he would stuff into his 
suit’s thigh pouches. Lee and 
Grote helped him; the women 
merely stood by the skimmer and 
watched the hills blaze with 
lights 

Sirius disappeared below the 
horizon at last, and the show 
ended. The hills returned to be- 
ing brownish, erosion-worn 
slumps of rock. 

“Glass mountains,” Marlene 
marvelled as they returned to the 
skimmer. 

“Not glass,” Charnovsky cor- 
rected. “Glazed rock. Granitic, 
no doubt. Probably was melted 
when the Pup exploded. Atmo- 
sphere might have been blown 
24 



away, and rock cooled very rap- 
idly.” 

Lee could see Marlene’s chin 
rise stubbornly inside the trans- 
parent dome of her suit. “I name 
them the Glass Mountains,” she 
said firmly. 

Grote had smuggled a bottle 
along with them, part of his per- 
sonal stock. “My most precious 
possession,” he rightfully called 
it. But for the Glass Moimtains 
he dug it out of its hiding place 
and they toasted both the dis- 
covery and the name. Marlene 
smiled and insisted that Lee also 
be toasted, as co- discoverer. 

T Tours later, Lee grew tired' of 
staring at the metal ceiling 
of the sleeping quarters a few 
inches above his top-tier bunk. 
Even Grote’s drinks didn’t help 
him to sleep. He kept wondering 
about the humanoids, what they 
were doing, where they were 
from, how he would get to learn 
their secrets. As quietly as he 
could, he slipped down from the 
bunk. The two men beneath him 
were breathing deeply and even- 
ly. Lee headed for the rear hatch, 
past the women’s bunks. 

The hard suits were standing 
at stiff attention, flanking both 
sides of the rear hatch. Lee was 
in his coveralls. He strapped on 
a pair of boots, slid the hatch 
open as quietly as he could, and 
stepped out onto the fender. 

GALAXY 



The air was cool and clean, 
the sky, bright enough for him to 
make out the worn old hills. 
There were a few stars in the sky, 
but the hills didn’t reflect them. 

He heard a movement behind 
him. Turning, he saw Marlene. 

“Did I wake you?’’ 

“I’m a very light sleeper,” slie 
said. 

“Sorry, I didn’t mean — ” 

“No, I’m glad you did.” She 
shook her head slightly, and for 
the first time Lee noticed the 
sweep and softness of her hair. 
The light was too dim to make 
its color, but he remembered it 
as chestnut. 

“Besides,” sKe whispered, “I’ve 
been longing to get outside with- 
out being in one of those damned 
suits.” 

He helped Ker down from the 
fender, and they walked a little 
way from the skimmer. 

“Can we see the sun?” she ask- 
ed, looking skyward. 

“I’m not sure, I think maybe 
. there. ...” He pointed to 
a second-magnitude star, shining 
alone in the grayish sky. 

“Where, which one?” 

He took her by the shoulder 
with one hand so that she could 
see where he was pointing. 

“Oh yes, I see it.” 

She turned, and she was in His 
arms, and he kissed her. He held 
onto her as though there was 
nothing else in the universe. 
FOEMAN, WHERE DO YOU FLEE? 



If any of the others suspected 
that Lee and Marlene had spent 
the night outside, they didn’t 
mention it. All six of them took 
their regular pre-breakfast checks 
in the medical booth’, and by the 
time they were finished eating in 
the cramped galley the computer 
had registered a safe green for 
each of them. 

Lee slid out from the galley’s 
folding table and made his way 
forward. Grote Was slouched in 
the driver’s seat, his lanky frame 
a geometry of knees and elbows. 
He was studying the viewscreen 
map. 

“Looking for a pass through 
these hills for our vehicle,” he 
said absently, his eyes on the 
slowly-moving photomap. 

“Why take the skimmer?” Lee 
asked, sitting on the chair beside 
him. He came across these hills 
in the powersuits.” 

Grote cocked an eye at him. 
“You’re really set on getting to 
the coast, aren’t you?” 

“Aren’t you?” 

That brought a grin. “How 
much do you think we ought to 
carry with us?” 

VI 

'^hey split the team into three 
-*■ groups. Chien and Charnov- 
sky stayed with the car; Marlene 
and Doris would go with Lee and 
Grote to look at the flora and 

25 




fauna (if any) on the shore side 
of the hills. Lee and the engineer 
carried a pair of TV camera 
packs with them, to set up close 
to the shoreline. 

“Beware of the natives,” Char- 
novsky’s voice grated in Lee’s 
earphones as they walked away 
from the skimmer. “They might 
swoop down on you with bows 
and arrows!” His laughter showed 
what he thought of Lee's wor- 



Climbing the hills wasn’t as 
bad as Lee had thought it would 
be. The powersuits did most of 
the work, and the glassy rock was 
not smooth enough to cause real 
troubles with footing. It was hot 
though, even with the suit’s cool- 
ing equipment turned up full 
bore. Sirius blazed overhead, and 
the rocks beat glare and heat 
back into their faces as they 
climbed. 

It took most of the day to get 
over the crest of the hills. But 
finally with Sirius edging to- 
ward the horizon behind them, 
Lee saw the water. 

The sea spread to the farther 
horizon, cool and blue, with long 
gentle swells that steepened in- 
to surf as they ran up toward the 
land. And the land was green 
here: shrubs and mossy-looking 
plants were sprinkled around 
patchily. 

“Look! Right here!” Doris’s 
iroice.

GAUXY 




Lee swiveled his Head and saw 
Her clumsily sinking to Her knees, 
like an armor-plated elephant 
getting down ponderously from a 
circus trick. She knelt beside a 
fern-like plant. They all walked 
over and helped her to photo- 
graph it, snip a leaf from it, probe 
its root system. 

“Might as well sleep Here to- 
night,” Grote said. “I’ll take the 
first watch.” 

“Can’t we set the scanners to 
give an alarm if anything 
approaches?” Marlene asked. 
“There’s nothing here dangerous 
enough to — ” 

“I want one of us awake at 
all times,” Grote said firmly. 
“And nobody outside of their 
suits.” 

“There’s no place like home,” 
Doris muttered. “But after a 
while even your own smell gets 
to you.” 

^TT'he women lay down, locking 
the suits into roughly reclin- 
ing positions. To Lee they looked 
like oversized beetles that had 
gotten stuck on their backs. It 
didn’t look possible for them to 
ever get up again. Then another 
thought struck him, and he 
chuckled to himself. Super chas- 
tity belts. 

He sat down, cranked the suit’s 
torso section back to a comfort- 
able reclining angle, and tried to 
doze off. He was dreaming of the 

FOEMAN, WHERE DO YOU FLEE? 



towers on Titan again when 
Grote’s voice in his earphones 
woke him. 

“Is it my turn?” Ke asked grog- 
gy. 

“Not yet. But turn off your 
transmitter. You were groaning 
in your sleep. Don’t want to wake 
up the girls, do you?” 

Lee took the second watch and 
simply stayed awake until day- 
break without bothering any of 
the others. They began marching 
toward the sea. 

The hills descended only slight- 
ly into a rolling plateau that went 
on until they reached the bluffs 
that overlooked the sea. A few 
hundred feet down was a narrow 
strip of beach, with the break- 
ers surging in. 

“This is as far as we go” Grote 
said. 

The women spent the morning 
collecting plant samples. Marlene 
found a few insects and grew 
more excited over them than 
Doris had been about the shrub- 
bery. Lee and Grote v/alked along 
the edge of the cliffs looking for 
a good place to set up their cam- 
eras 

“You’re sure this is the area 
where they were seen?” Lee 
asked. 

The engineer walking alongside 
him, turned his head inside the 
plastic helmet. Lee could see he 
was edgy too. 

“I know how to read a map.” 

27 



“Sorry, I’m just anxious — ” 

“So am I.” 

They walked until Sirius was 
almost directly overhead, without 
seeing anything except the tire- 
less sea, the beacH, and the 
spongy-looking plants that Hud- 
dled close to the ground. 

“Not even a damned tree,” 
Grote grumbled. 

They turned back and headed 
for the spot where they had left 
the women. Far up the beach. 
Lee saw a tiny dark spot. 

“What’s that?” 

Grote stared for a few mo- 
ments. “Probably a rock.” But 
he touched a button on the chest 
of His suit. 

Lee did the same, and an elec- 
tro-optical viewpiece slid down in 
front of his eyes. Turning a dial 
on the suit’s control panel, He 
tried to focus on the spot. It wav- 
ered in the Heat currents of the 
early afternoon, blurred and un- 
certain. Then it seemed to jump 
out of view. 

Lee punched the button and 
the lens slid away from his eyes. 
“It’s moving!” he shouted, and 
started to run. 

He Heard Grote’s heavy breath- 
ing as the engineer followed him, 
and they both nearly flew in their 
powersuits along the edge of the 
cliffs. 

Tt was a man! No, not one, Lee 
-*• saw, but two of them walking 
28 



along the beach, their feet in the 
foaming water. 

“Get down you bloody fool” 
he heard Grote shrilling at him. 

He dove headlong, bounced, 
cracked the back of His Head 
against the helmet’s plastic, then 
banged his chin on the soft in- 
ner lining of the collar. 

“Don’t want them to see, do 
you?” Grote was whispering now. 

“They can’t hear us, for God’s 
sake,” Lee said into his suit ra- 
diophone. 

They wormed their way to the 
cliff’s edge again and watched. 
The two men seemed to be dress- 
ed in black. Or are they black- 
skinned and naked? Lee won- 
dered. 

After a Hurried council, they 
unslung one of the video cameras 
and its power unit, set it up right 
there, turned it on and then back- 
ed away from the edge of the 
cliff. Then they ran as hard as 
they could, staying out of sight 
of the beach, with the remaining 
camera. They passed the startled 
women and breathlessly shouted 
out their find. The women drop- 
ped their work and started run- 
ning after them. 

About a kilometer or so fur- 
ther on they dropped to all fours 
again and painfully crawled to 
the edge once more. Grote hissed 
the women into silence as they 
hunched up beside him. 

The beach was empty now. 

GALAXY 



“Do you think they saw us?” 
Lee asked. 

“Don’t know.” 

Lee used the electro-optics 
again and scanned the beach. “No 
sign of them.” 

“Their footprints,” Grote snap- 
ped. “Look there.” 

The trails of two very human- 
looking sets of footprints march- 
ed straight into the water. All 
four of them searched the sea for 
hours, but saw nothing. Finally, 
they decided to set up the other 
camera. It was turning dark by 
the time they finished. 

“We’ve got to get back to the 
car,” Grote said, wearily, when 
they finished. “There’s not enough 
food in the suits for another day.” 

“I’ll stay here,” Lee replied. 
“You can bring me more supplies 
tomorrow.” 

“No. If there’s anything to see, 
the cameras will pick it up. Chien 
is monitoring them back at the 
car, and the whole crew of the 
ship must be watching the view.” 

Lee saw there was no sense 
arguing. Besides, he was bone- 
tired. But he knew he’d be back 
again as soon as he could get 
there. 

VII 

(i^TTell, it settles a th'ree-hun- 
' ’ dred-year-old argument,” 
Aaron Hatfield said as he watch- 
ed the viewscreen. 

FOEAAAN, WHERE DO YOU FLEE? 



The biochemest and Lee were 
sitting in the main workroom ©f 
the ship’s Sirius globe, watching 
the humanoids as televised by the 
cameras on the cliffs. Chamov- 
sky was on the other side of the 
room, at a workbench, flashing 
rock chips with a laser so that 
a spectrometer could analyze their 
chemical composition. The other 
outsiders were traveling in the 
skimmer again, collecting more 
floral and insect specimens. 

“What argument?” Lee asked. 

Hatfield shifted in his chair, 
making the webbing creak. 
“About the human form . 
whether it’s an accident or a re- 
sult of evolutionary selection. 
From them,” he nodded toward 
the screen, “I’d say it’s no acci- 
dent.” 

One camera was on wide-field 
focus and showed a group ©f 
three of the men. They were wad- 
ing hips-deep in the surf, carry- 
ing slender rods high above their 
heads to keep them free of the 
surging waves. The other camera 
was fixed on a close-up view ®f 
three women standing up the 
beach, watching their men. Like 
the men, they were completely 
naked and black-skinned. They 
looked human in every detail. 

Every morning they appeared 
on the beach, often carrying the 
rods, but sometimes not. Lee con- 
cluded that they must live in 
caves cut into the cliffs. The rods 

29 



looked like simple bone spears, 
but even under the closest focus 
of the cameras he couldn’t be 
sure. 

“They’re not Negroid,” he mut- 
tered, more to himself than any- 
one listening. 

“It’s hard to tell, isn’t it?” Hat- 
field asked. 

Nodding, Lee said, “They just 
don’t look like terrestrial Negroes 
. except for their skin color- 
ing. And that’s an adaptation to 
Sirius’s brightness. Plenty of ul- 
traviolet, too. ” 

Charnovsky came over and 
pulled up a chair. “So. Have they 
caught any fish this morning?” 

“Not yet,” Lee answered. 

Jabbing a stubby finger toward 
the screen, the Russian asked, 
“Are these the geniuses who built 
the machines on Titan? Fishing 
with bone spears? They don’t 
make much of an enemy, Lee.” 

“They could have been our en- 
emy,” Lee answered, forcing a 
thin smile. He was getting ac- 
customed to Charnovsky’s nee- 
dling, but not reconciled to it. 

'^he geologist shook his head 
sadly.“Take the advice of an 
older man, dear friend, and dis- 
abuse yourself of this idea. Sta- 
tistics are a powerful tool, Lee. 
The chances of this particular 
race being the one that built on 
Titan are fantastically high. And 
the chances. ...” 

30 



“What’re the chances that two 
intelligent races will both evolve 
along the same physical lines?” 
Lee snapped. 

Charnovsky shrugged. “We 
have two known races. They are 
both human in form. The chances 
must be excellent.” 

Lee turned back to watch the 
viewscreen, then asked Hatfield. 
“Aaron, the biochemistry is very 
similar to Earth’s, isn’t it?” 
“Very close.” 

“I mean ... I could eat local 
food and be nourished by it? I 
wouldn’t be poisoned or anything 
like that?” 

“Well,” Hatfield said, visibly 
thinking it out as he spoke, “as 
far as the structure of the pro- 
teins and other foodstuffs are con- 
cerned . yes, I guess you could 
get away with eating it. The bio- 
chemistry is basically the same as 
ours, as nearly as I’ve been able 
to tell. But so are terrestrial shell- 
fish, 'and they make me deathly 
ill. You see, there’re all sorts of 
enzymes, and microbial para- 
sites, and viruses. ...” 

“We’ve been living with the lo- 
cal bugs for months now,” Lee 
said. “We’re adapted to them, 
aren’t we?” 

“You know what they say 
about visiting strange places: 
don’t drink the water.” 

One of the natives struck into 
the water with his spear and in- 
stantly the water began to boil 

GALAXY 



with’ the thrashing of some sea 
creature. The other two men 
drove their spears home, and the 
thrashing died. They lifted a 
four-foot-long fish out of the wa- 
ter and started back for the 
beach, carrying it triumphantly 
over their heads. The camera”s 
autotracker kept the picture on 
them. The women on the beach 
were jumping and clapping with 
joy. 

“Damn,” Lee said softly. 
“They’re as human as we are.” 

“And obviously representative 
of a high technical civilization,” 
Chamovsky said. 

“Survivors of one, maybe,” 
Lee answered. “Their culture 
might have been wiped out by 
the Pup’s explosion ... or by 
war.” 

“Ah, now it gets even more dra- 
matic: two cultures destroyed, 
ours and theirs.” 

“All right, go ahead and laugh,” 
Lee said. “I won’t be able to 
prove anything until I get to live 
with them.” 

“Until what?” Hatfield said. 

“Until I go out there and meet 
them face to face, learn their lan- 
guage, their culture, live with 
them.” 

C4T ive with them?” Rassmus- 
^ sen looked startled, the 
first time Lee had seen him jar- 
red. The captain’s mono-molec- 
lar biosuit gave his craggy face 
FOEMAN, WHERE DO YOU FLEE? 



a faint sheen, like the beginnings 
of a sweat. 

They were sitting around a cir- 
cular table in the conference room 
of the Sirius globe: the six “out- 
siders,” Grote, Chien, Captain 
Rassmussen, Pascual and Leh- 
man. 

“Aren’t you afraid they might 
put you in a pot and boil you?” 
Grote asked, grinning. 

“I don’t think they Have pots. 
Or fire, for that matter,” Lee 
countered. 

The laugh turned on Grote. 

Lee went on quitely, “I’ve 
checked it out with Aaron, here. 
There’s no biochemical reason 
why I couldn’t survive in the na- 
tive environment. Doris and Mar- 
lene have agreed to gather the 
same types of food we’ve seen the 
humanoids carrying, and I’ll go 
on a strictly native diet for a few 
weeks before I go to live with 
them.” 

Lehman hunched forward, 
from across the table, and asked 
Lee, “About the dynamics of hav- 
ing a representative of our rela- 
tively advanced culture step in- 
to their primitive — ” 

“I won’t be representing an ad- 
vanced culture to them,” Lee 
said. “I intend to be just as naked 
and tool-less as they are. And 
just as black. Aaron can inject 
me with the proper enzymes to 
turn my skin black.” 

“That would be necessary in 

31 



any event if you don’t want to be 
sunburned to death,” Pascual 
said. 

Hatfield added, “You’ll also 
need contact lenses that’ll screen 
out the UV and protect your 
eyes.” 

They spent an hour discussing 
all the physical precautions he 
would have to take. Lee kept 
glancing at Rassmussen. The 
idea’s slipping out from under 
his control. The captain watched 
each speaker in turn, squinting 
with concentration and sinking 
deeper and deeper into his Viking 
scowl.: Then, when Lee was cer- 
tain that the captain could no 
longer object, Rassmussen spoke 
up: 

“One more question. Are you 
willing to give up an eye for 
this mission of yours?” 

CtXl^hat do you mean?” 

’ " The captain’s hands 
seemed to wander loosely with- 
out a mug of beer to tie them 
down. “Well . you seem to be 
willing to run a good deal of per- 
sonal risk to live with' these eh, 
people. From the expedition’s 
viewpoint, you will also be risk- 
ing our only anthropologist, you 
know. I think the wise thing to 
do, in that case, would be to have 
a running record of everything 
you see and hear.” 

Lee nodded. 

“So we can swap one of your 

32 



eyes for a TV camera and plant 
a transmitter somewhere in your 
skull. I’m sure there’s enough 
empty space in your head to ac- 
commodate them.” The captain 
chuckled toothily at his joke. 

“We can’t do an eye procedure 
here,” Pascual argued. “It’s too 
risky.” 

“I understand that Dr. Tanaka 
is quite expert in that field,” the 
captain said. “And naturally we 
would preserve the eye to restore 
it afterwards. Unless, of course, 
Professor Lee — ” He let the sug- 
gestion dangle. 

Lee looked at them sitting 
around the big table: Rassmus- 
sen, tr3ung to look noncommit- 
tal; Pascual, upset and nearly 
angry; Lehman, staring intently 
right back into Lee’s eyes. 

You’re just trying to force me 
to hack down, Lee thought of 
Rassmussen. Then, of Lehman, 
And if I don’t back down, you’ll 
be convinced that I’m crazy. 

For a long moment there was 
no sound in the crowded confer- 
ence room except the faint whir 
of the air blower. 

“All right,” Lee said. “If Ta- 
naka is willing to tackle the sur- 
gery, so am I.” 

VIII 

■^T^hen Lee returned to his cu- 
’ ' bide, the message light un- 
der the phone screen was blink- 

GALAXY 



ing red. He flopped on tKe bunk, 
propped a pillow under his head, 
and asked the computer, “What’s 
the phone message?” 

The screen lit up; PLS CALL 
DR. LEHMAN. 

My son, the psychiatrist. 
“Okay,” he said aloud, “get 
him.” 

A moment later Lehman’s tan- 
ned face filled the screen. 

“I was expecting you to call,” 
Lee said. 

The psychiatrist nodded. “You 
agreed to pay a big price just to 
get loose among the natives.” 
“Tanaka can handle the sur- 
gery,” he answered evenly. 

“It’ll take a month before you 
are fit to leave the ship again.” 
““You know what our Viking 
captain says . we’ll stay here 
as long as the beer holds out.” 
Lehman smiled. Professional 
technique, Lee thought. 

“Sid, do you really think you 
can mingle with these people 
without causing any cultural im- 
pact? Without changing them?” 
Shrugging, he answered, “I 
don’t know. I hope so. As far as 
we know, they’re the only hu- 
manoid group on the planet. 
They may have never seen a 
stranger before.” 

“That’s what I mean,” Leh- 
man said. “Don’t you feel that — ” 
“Let’s cut the circling. Rich. 
You know why I want to see 
them first-hand. If we had the 
FOEMAN, WHERE DO YOU FLEE? 



time I’d study them remot<rfy fof 
a good long while before trykig 
any contact. But it gets bask to 
the beer supply. We’ve got to 
squeeze everything we caa out 
of them in a little more th®a four 
years.” 

“There will be other 
tions, after we return to Earth 
and tell them about these peoi 
pie.” 

“Probably so. But they ¥e 
too late.” 

“Too late for what?” 

His neck was starting to hurt; 
Lee himched up to a sitting po- 
sition on the bunk. “Figwe it 
out. There can’t be more 
about fifty people in the group 
we’ve been watching. I’ve oaly 
seen a couple of children. And 
there aren’t any other humanoid 
groups on the planet. That means 
they’re dying out. This gang is 
the last of their kind. By the time 
another expedition gets here^ 
there might not be any of them 
left.” 

For once, Lehman looked sur- 
prised “Do you really think so?” 

“Yes. And before they die, we 
have to get some information out 
of them.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“They might not be natives o£ 
this planet,” Lee said, forcing 
himself to speak calmly, keeping 
his face a mask, freezing any 
emotion inside him. “They prob^ 
ably came from somewhere else. 

33 



That elsewhere is the home of 
the people who built the Titan 
machine . their real home. We 
have got to find out where it is.” 
Flawless logic. 

Lehman tried to smile again. 
“That’s assuming your theory 
about an ancient war is right.” 
“Yes. Asuming I’m right.” 
“Assume you are,” Lehman 
said. “And assume you find wHat 
you’re looking for. Then what? 
Do you just take off and go 
back to Earth? What happens to 
the people here?” 

“I don’t know,” Lee said, ice- 
cold inside. “The main problem 
will be how to deal with the 
homeworld of their people.” 
“But the people here, do we 
just let them die out-” 

“Maybe. I guess so.” 

Lehman’s smile was completely 
gone now; his face didn’t look 
pleasant at all. 

I t took much more than a month. 

The surgery was difficult. 
And beneath all the pain was 
Lee’s rooted fear that He might 
never Have His sight fully restor- 
ed again. While He was recover- 
ing, before He was allowed out 
of His infirmary bed, Hatfield 
turned His skin black with a se- 
ries of enzsmie injections. He was 
also fitted for a single quartz 
contact lens. 

Once fie was up and around, 
Marlene followed him constant- 
34 



ly. Finally she said, “You’re even 
better looking with black skin; 
it makes you more mysterious. 
And the prosthetic eye looks ex- 
actly like your own. It even 
moves like the natural one.” 

Rassmussen still plodded. Long 
after He felt strong enough to get 
going again, he was still confined 
to the ship. When his complaints 
grew loud enough, they let Him 
start on a diet of native foods. 
The medics and Hatfield hovered 
around him while he spent a mis- 
erable week with dysentary. Then 
it passed. But it took a while to 
build up his strength again; all 
he had to eat now were fish, in- 
sects, and pulpy greens. 

After more tests, conferences, a 
two-week trial run out by the 
Glass Moimtains, and then still 
more exhaustive physical exams, 
Rassmussen at last agreed to let 
Lee go. 

Grote took him out in the 
skimmer, skirting the long way 
around the Glass Mountains, 
through the surf and out onto the 
gently billowing sea. They kept 
far enough out at sea for the 
beach to be constantly beyond 
their Horizon. 

When night fell, Grote nosed 
the skimmer landward. They 
came ashore around midnight, 
with the engines clamped down 
to near silence, a few kilometers 
up the beach from the human- 
oids’ site. Grote, encased in a 

GALAXY 



powersuit, walked witH film part 
way and buried a relay trans- 
ceiver in the sand, to pick up the 
signals from tfie camera and ra- 
dio imbedded in Lee’s skull. 

“Good luck.” His voice was 
muffled by the helmet. 

Lee watched him plod mechan- 
ically back into the darkness. He 
strained to hear the skimmer as 
it turned and slipped back into 
the sea, but he could neither see 
nor hear it. 

He was alone on the beach. 



^louds were drifting landward, 
riding smoothly overhead. 
The breeze on the beach, though, 
was blowing warmly out of the 
desert, spilling over the bluffs 
and across the beach, out to sea. 
The sky was bright with the all- 
night twilight glow, even though 
the clouds blotted out most of 
the stars. Along the foot of the 
cliffs, though, it was deep black. 
Except for the wind, there wasn’t 
a sound: not a bird nor a noc- 
turnal cat, not even an insect’s 
chirrup. 

Lee stayed near the water’s 
edge. He wasn’t cold, even though 
naked. Still, He could feel him- 
self trembling. 

Grate’s out there, he told him- 
self. If you need him, he can 
come rolling up the beach in 
ten minutes. 

But He knew He was alone. 
FOEAflAN, WHERE DO YOU FLEE? 



The clouds thickened and be- 
gan to sprinkle rain, a warm, soft 
shower. Lee blinked the drops 
away from his eyes and walked 
slowly, a hundred paces one di- 
rection, then a htuidred paces 
back again. 

The rain stopped as the sea 
Horizon started turning bright. 
The clouds wafted away. The sky 
lightened, first gray, then almost 
milky white. Lee looked toward 
the base of the cliffs. Dark shad- 
ows dotted the rugged cliff face. 
Caves. Some of them were ten 
feet or more above the sand. 

Sirius edged a limb above the 
horizon, and Lee, squinting, turn- 
ed away from its brilliance. He 
looked back at the caves again, 
feeling the warmth of the hot 
star’s might on his back. 

The first ones out of the cave 
were two children. They tumbled 
out of the same cave, off to Lee’s 
left, giggling and nmning. 

When they saw Lee, they 
stopped dead. As though some- 
one had turned them off. Lee 
could feel his heart beating as 
they stared at Him. He stood just 
as still as they did, perhaps a 
hundred meters from them. They 
looked about five and ten years 
old, he judged. li their lifespans 
are the same as ours. 

The taller of the two boys took 
a step toward Lee, then turned 
and ran back into the cave. The 
younger boy followed him. 



35 



F or several minutes nothing 
happened. Then Lee heard 
voices echoing from inside the 
cave. Angry? Frightened? They 
are not laughing. 

Four men appeared at tfie 
mouth of the cave. Their hands 
were empty. They simply stood 
there and gaped at him, from the 
shadows of the cave’s mouth. 

Now we’ll start learning their 
customs about strangers, Lee said 
to himself. 

Very deliberately, lie turned 
away from them and took a few 
steps up the beach. Then he stop- 
ped, turned again, and walked 
back to his original spot. 

Two of the men disappeared 
inside the cave. The other two 
stood there. Lee couldn’t tell 
what the expressions on their 
faces meant. Suddenly other peo- 
ple appeared at a few of the oth- 
er cave entrances. They’re inter- 
connected. 

Lee tried a smile and waved. 
There were women among the 
onlookers now, and a few chil- 
dren. One of the boys who saw 
him first — at least, it looked like 
him — started chattering to an 
adult. The man silenced him with 
a brusque gesture. 

It was getting hot. Lee could 
feel perspiration dripping along 
his ribs as Sirius climbed above 
the horizon and shone straight at 
the cliffs. Slowly, he squatted 
down on the sand. 

36 



A few of the men from hie first 
cave stepped out onto the beach. 
Two of them were carrying bone 
spears. Others edged out from 
their caves. They slowly drew 
together, keeping close to the 
rocky cliff wall, and started talk- 
ing in low, earnest tones. 

They’re puzzled, all right. Just 
play it cool. Don’t make any sud- 
den moves. 

He leaned forward slightly and 
traced a triangle on the sand 
with one finger. 

When he looked up again, a 
grizzled, white-haired man had 
taken a step or two away from 
the conference group. Lee smiled 
at him, and the elder froze in his 
tracks. With a shrug, Lee looked 
back at the first cave. The boy 
was still there, with a woman 
standing beside him, gripping his 
shoulder. Lee waved and smiled. 
The boy’s hand fluttered momen- 
tarily. 

The old man said something 
to the group, and one of the 
younger men stepped out to join 
him. Neither held a weapon. 
They walked to within a few me- 
ters of Lee, and the old man said 
something, as loudly and bravely 
as he could muster. 

L ee bowed his head. “Good 
morning. I am Professor 
Sidney Lee of the University of

Lee Held up His Hands and said,

I’m from someplace else, and I 
don’t speak your language. Now 
if you want to start teacHing 
me — ” 

TKey sHook tKeir Heads, talked

Lee smiled at tfiem and waited 
for tKem to stop talking. WHen 
tHey did. He pointed to Himself 
and said very clearly, “Lee.” 

He spent an Hour at it, repeat- 
ing only that one syllable, no

to each OtKer. THe Heat was get-

ly and stiffly. He beckoned to Lee 
to do the same.

behind, carrying several bone 
spears for their — wHat? Fa-

THe old man was saying some- 
ifiing to Him. Pointing toward tHe 
caves. He took a step in tHat di- 
irection, then jnotioned for Lee 
to come along. Lee Hesitated. THe 
old man smiled a toothless smile 
and repeated His invitation. 

Grinning back at Him in re- 
alization, Lee said aloud, “Okay. 
If you’re not scared of me I guess 
I don’t Have to be scared of you.”

I t took more tfian a year be- 
fore Lee learned their lan- 
guage well enough to understand 
rougHly wKat tHey were saying. 
It was an odd language, sparse 
and practically devoid of pro- 
nouns.

made tHe adults smile, wKen they

TKey called tfie planet Makta,

sen entered that as its official 
name in the expedition’s log. He 
made a point of walking the 
beacH alone one night each week, 
to talk witH tHe others at the 
sKip and make a personal report. 
He quickly foxmd that most of 
what He saw. Heard and said in- 
side the caves never got out to

tfie relay transceiver buried up 
the beach; the cliff’s rock walls 
were too much of a barrier. 

Ardraka was the oldest of tfie 
clan and the nominal chief. His 
son, Ardra, was the yoimger man 
who had also come out to talk 
with Lee that first day. Ardra 
actually gave most of the orders. 
Ardraka could overrule him 
whenever he cfiose to, but fie 
seldom exercised the right. 

There were only forty-tfiree 
people in the clan, nearly half 
of them elderly-looking. Eleven 
were pre-adolescent children; two 
of them infants. There were no 
obvious pregnancies. Ardraka 
must have been about fifty, judg- 
ing by his oldest son’s apparent 
age. But the old man had the 
wrinkled, sunken look of an eigh- 
ty-year-old. The people them- 
selves had very little idea of time 
beyond the basic rhythm of nigfit 
and day. 

They came out of tfie caves 
only during the early morning 
and evening hours. The blazing 
midday heat of Sirius was too 
much for them to face. They ate 
crustaceans and the small fisfi 
that dwelt in the shallows along 
the beach, insects, and tfie grub- 
by vegetation that clung to tfie 
base of the cliffs. Occasionally 
they found a large fish that had 
blundered into the shallows; then 
they feasted. 

They had no wood, no metal, 
38 



no fire. Tfieir only tools were 
from the precious bones of tfie 
rare big fisfi, and hand-worked 
rock. 

They died of disease and in- 
jury, and aged prematurely fronf 
poor diet and overwork. They 
had to search constantly for food, 
especially since half their day 
was taken away from them by 
Sirius’s blowtorch heat. They 
were more apt to be prowling tfie 
beach at night, himting seaworms 
and crabs, than by daylight. 
Grote and I damn near barged 
right into them, Lee realized af- 
ter watching a few of the nigfit 
gathering sessions. 

^"T^here were some dangers. One 
morning he was watching 
one of the teenaged boys, a good 
swimmer, venture out past tfie 
shallows in search of fisfi. A 
sharklike creature found him first. 

When he screamed, half a doz- 
en men grabbed spears and dove 
into the surf. Lee found himself 
dashing into the water alongside 
them, empty-handed. He swam 
out to the youngster, already 
dead, sprawled face down in the 
water, half of him gone, blood 
staining the swells. Lee helped to 
pull the remains back to shore. 

There wasn’t anything defin- 
ite, no one said a word to him 
about it, but their attitude to- 
ward him changed. He was fully 
accepted now. He hadn’t saved 

GALAXY 




the boy’s life, Hadn’t sHown un- 
common bravery. But He had 
shared a danger with them, and 
a sorrow. 

Wheel the horse inside the 
gates of Troy. Lee found himself 
thinking. Nobody ever told you 
to beware of men bearing gifts. 

After he got to really under- 
stand their language Lee found 
that Ardraka often singled him 
out for long talks. It was almost 
funny. There was something that 
the old man was fishing for, just 
as Lee was trying to learn where 
these people really came from. 

They were sitting in the cool 
darkness of the central cove, deep 
inside the cliff. All the outer 
caves channeled back to this sin- 



gle large chamber, higH-roofed 
and moss-floored, its rocks faint- 
ly phosphorescent. It was big 
enough to hold four or five times 
the clan’s present number. It was 
midday. Most of the people were 
sleeping. A few of the children, 
off to the rear of the cave, were 
scratching pictures on the packed 
bare earth with pointed, fist- 
sized rocks. 

Lee sat witH his back resting 
against a cool stone wall. The 
sleepers were paired off, man and 
mate, for the most part. The un- 
mated teenagers slept apart, with 
the older couples between them. 
As far as Lee could judge, the 
couples paired permanently, al- 
though the teens played the game 



FOEAAAN, WHERE PO YOU FLEE?

about as freely as they could. 

Ardraka was dozing beside him. 
Lee settled back and tried to turn 
off his thoughts, but the old man 
said; 

“Lee is not asleep?” 

“No, Lee is not,” Ke answered. 
“Ardraka has seen that Lee 
seldom sleeps,” Ardrake said. 
“That is true.” 

“Is it that Lee does not need 
to sleep as Ardraka does?” 

Lee shook his head. “No, Lee 
needs sleep as much as Ardraka 
or any man.” 

“This . place . that Lee 
comes from. Lee says it is beyond 
the sea?” 

“Yes, far beyond.” 

In the faint light from the 
gleaming rocks, the old man’s 
face looked troubled, deep in dif- 
ficult thought. 

“And there are men and wom- 
en living in Lee’s place, men and 
women like the people here?” 
Lee nodded. 

“And how did Lee come here? 
Did Lee swim around the sea?” 

'^T'hey had been through this 
many times. “Lee came around 
the edge of the sea, walking on 
land just as Ardraka would.” 
Laughing softly, the old man 
said, “Ardraka is too feeble now 
for such a walk. Ardra could 
make such a walk.” 

“Yes, Ardra can.” 

“Ardraka has tried to dream 
40 



of Lee’s’ place, and Lee’s people. 
But such dreams do not come.” 
“Dreams are Hard to com- 
mand,” Lee said. 

“Yes, truly.” 

“And what of Ardraka and tHe 
people Here?” Lee asked. “Is tKis 
tHe only place wHere sucK men 
and women live?” 

“Yes. It is tHe best place to 
live. All other places are deatJi.” 
“There are no men and wom- 
en such as Ardraka and tHe peo- 
ple here living in another place?” 
The old man thought hard a 
moment, then smiled a wrinkled 
toothless smile. “Surely Lee 
jokes. Lee knows that Lee’s peo- 
ple live in another place.” 

We’ve been around that bush 
before. Trying another tack, he 
asked, “Have Ardraka’s people 
always lived in this place? Did 
Ardraka’s father live here?” 
“Yes, of course.” 

“And his father?” 

A nod. 

“And all the fathers, from the 
beginning of the people? All lived 
here, always?” 

A shrug. “No man knows.” 
“Have there always been this 
many people living here?” Lee 
asked. “Did Ardraka’s people 
ever fill this cave when they slept 
here?” 

“Oh yes. When Ardraka 
was a boy, many men and wom- 
en slept in the outer caves, since 
there was no room for them here. 

GALAXY 



And when Ardraka’s father was 
young, men and women even 
slept in the lower caves.” 

“Lower caves?” 

Ardraka nodded. “Below this 
one, deeper inside the ground. 
No man or woman has been in 
them since Ardraka became 
chief.” 

“Why is that?” 

The old man evaded Lee’s eyes. 
“They are not needed.” 

“May Lee visit these lower 
caves?” 

“Perhaps,” Ardraka said. Af- 
ter a moment’s thought, he added, 
“Children have been born and 
grown to manhood and died 
since any man set foot in those 
caves. Perhaps they are gone now. 
Perhaps Ardraka does not re- 
member how to find them.” 

“Lee would like to visit the 
lower caves.” 

T ate that night he walked the 
' beach alone, under the glow- 
ing star-poor sky, giving his 
weekly report back to the ship. 

“He’s been cagy about the low- 
er caves,” Lee said as the out- 
stretched fingers of surf curled 
around his ankles. 

“Why should he be so cau- 
tious?” It was Marlene’s voice. 
She was taking the report this 
night. 

“Because he’s no fool, that’s 
why. These people have never 
seen a stranger before . not 
FOEMAN, WHERE DO YOU FLEE? 



for generations, at least. There- 
fore their behavior toward me is 
original, not instinctive. If he’s 
leery of showing me the caves, 
it’s for some reason that’s fresh in 
his mind, not some hoary tribal 
taboo.” 

“Then what do you intend to 
do?” 

“I’m not sure yet — ” Lee 
turned to head back down the 
beach and saw Ardra standing 
twenty paces behind him. 

“Company,” he snapped. “Talk 
to you later. Keep listening.” 

Advancing toward him, Ardra 
said, “Many nights, Ardra has 
seen Lee leave the cave and walk 
on the beach. Tonight Lee was 
talking, but Lee was alone. Does 
Lee speak to a man or woman 
that Ardra cannot see?” 

His tone was flat, factual, nei- 
ther frightened nor puzzled. It 
was too dark to really make out 
the expression on his face, but he 
sounded almost casual. 

“Lee is alone,” he answered as 
calmly as he could. “There is no 
man or woman here with Lee. 
Except Ardra.” 

“But Lee speaks and then is 
silent. And then Lee speaks 
again.” 

He knows a conversation when 
he hears one, even if ifs only one 
side of it and in a strange lan- 
guage. 

Ardra suggested, “Perhaps Lee 
speaks to men and women from 

41 



X 



Lee’s place, which is far from the 
sea?” 

“Does Ardra believe that Lee 
can speak to men and women far 
away from this place?” 

“Ardra believes that is what 
Lee does at night on the beach. 
Lee speaks with the Karta.” 

“Karta? What is the meaning 
of karta?” 

“It is an ancient word. It means 
men and women who live in an- 
other place.” 

Others, Lee translated to him- 
self. “Yes,” he said to Ardra, 
“Lee, speaks to the others.” 

Ardra’s breath seemed to catcH 
momentarily, then he said with 
deliberate care, “Lee speaks with 
the Others.” His voice had an 
edge of steel to it now. 

What have I stepped into? 

“It is time to be sleeping, not 
walking the beach,” Ardra said, in 
a tone that Lee knew was a com- 
mand. And he started walking to- 
ward the caves. 

Lee outweighed the chief’s son 
by a good twenty pounds and 
was some ten centimeters taller. 
But he had seen the speed and 
strength in Ardra’s wiry frame, 
and knew the difference in reac- 
tion times that the fifteen years 
between them made. So he didn’t 
run or fight; he followed Ardra 
back to the caves and obediently 
went to sleep. And all the night 
Ardra stayed awake and watched 
over him. 

42 



^T^he next morning, when the 
i men went out to fish and the 
women to gather greens, Ardra 
took Lee’s arm and led Him to- 
ward the back of the central cave. 
Ardraka and five other elders 
were waiting for them. They all 
looked very grim. Only then did 
Lee realize that Ardra was carry- 
ing a spear in his other hand. 

They were sitting in a ragged 
semicircle, their backs to what 
looked like a tunnel entrance, 
their eyes hard on Lee. He sat 
at their focus, with Ardra squat- 
ting beside him. 

“Lee,” Ardraka began without 
preliminaries, “why is it that Lee 
wishes to see the lower caves?” 
The question caught him by 
surprise. “Because . Lee wishes 
to learn more about Ardraka’s 
people. Lee comes from far away, 
and knows little of Ardraka’s 
people.” 

“Is it true,” one of the elders 
asked, “that Lee speaks at night 
with the Others?” His inflection 
made the word sound special, 
fearful, ominous. 

“Lee speaks to the men and 
women of the place where Lee 
came from. It is like the way 
Ardraka speaks to Ardraka’s 
grandfather ... in a dream.” 
“But Ardraka sleeps when do- 
ing this. Lee is awake.” 

Ardra broke in, “Lee says Lee’s 
GALAXY 



people live beyond tKe sea. Be- 
yond tHe sea is tKe sky. Do Lee’s 
people live in tHe sky?” 

Off the edge of the world, just 
like Columbus. “Yes,” He admit- 
ted. “Lee’s people live in the 
sky — ” 

“Seel” Ardra sKouted. “Lee is 
of tHe OtHers!” 

THe councilmen physically 
backed away from him. Even Ar- 
draka seemed shaken. 

“Lee is of the Others,” Ardra 
repeated. “Lee must be killed, 
before he kills Ardraka’s people!” 

CCT^ill?” Lee felt stunned. He 
had never heard any of 
them speak of violence before. 

“WKy should Lee kill the peo- 
ple Here?” 

They were all babbling at once. 
Ardraka raised his hand for si- 
lence. 

“To kill a man is very serious,” 
He said painfully. “It is not cer- 
tain that Lee is of the Others.” 

“Lee says is with Lee’s own 
mouth!” Ardra insisted. “Why 
else did Lee come here? Why 
does Lee want to see the lower 
caves?” 

Ardraka glowered at his son, 
and the younger man stopped. 
“The Council must be certain be- 
fore it acts.” 

Struggling to keep his voice 
calm, Ardra ticked off on his 
fingers, “Lee says Lee’s people 
live in the sky . the Others 
FOEMAN, WHERE DO YOU FLEE? 



live in the sky. Lee wishes to see 
the lower caves. Why? To see if 
more of Ardraka’s people are 
living tfiere, so that he can kill 
all tHe people!” 

THe Council members mxirmur- 
ed and glanced at him fearfully. 
Starting to look like a lynch jury. 

“Wait,” Lee said. “There is 
more to tHe truth than what Ar- 
dra says, Lee’s people live in the 
sky . tHat is true. But that does 
not mean tHat Lee’s people are 
tKe OtHers. THe sky is wide and 
larger . , wider than the sea, by 
far. Many different peoples can 
live in the sky.” 

Ardraka nodded, his brows 
knitted in concentration. “But, 
Lee, if botH Lee’s people and the 
Others live in the sky, why have 
not the Others destroyed Lee’s 
people as they destroyed Ardra- 
ka’s ancestors?” 

Lee felt His stomach drop out 
of him. So that’s it! 

“Yes,” one of the Councilmen 
said. “The Others live far from 
this land, yet the Others came 
here and destroyed Ardraka’s 
forefathers and all the works of 
such men and women.” 

“Tell Lee what happened,” he 
said, stalling for time to work up 
answers. “Lee knows nothing 
about the Others.” Not from your 
side of the war, anyway. 

Ardraka glanced around at the 
Council members sitting on both 
sides of him. They looked uncer- 

43 



tain, wary, still afraid. Ardra, be- 
side Lee, had the fixed glare of a 
born prosecutor. 

“Lee is not of Ardraka’s peo- 
ple,” the younger man said, bare- 
ly controlling the fury in his 
voice. “Lee must be of th'e Oth- 
ers. There are no people except 
Ardraka’s people and the Oth- 
ers!” 

“Perhaps that is not so,” Ar- 
draka said. “True, Ardraka has 
always thought it to be this way, 
but Lee looks like an ordinary 
man, not like the Others.” 

Ardra huffed. “No living man 
has seen the Others. How can 
Ardraka say ...” 

“Because Andraka has seen pic- 
tures of the Others,” the chief 
said quietly. 

“Pictures?” They were startled. 

“Yes. In the deepest cave, 
where only the chief can go . 
and the chief’s son. Ardraka had 
thought for a long time that soon 
Ardra should see the deepest 
cave. But no longer. Ardra must 
see the cave now.” 

The old man got up, stiffly, to 
his feet. His son was visibly trem- 
bling with eagerness. 

“May Lee also see the pic- 
tures?” Lee asked. 

They all began to protest, but 
Ardraka said firmly, “Lee has 
been accused of being of the 
Others. Lee stands in peril of 
death. It is right that Lee should 
see the pictures.” 

44 



The Council members mutter- 
ed among themselves. Ardra 
glowered, then bent down and 
reached for the spear he had left 
at his feet. Lee smiled to him- 
self. If those pictures give you 
the slightest excuse, you’re going 
to ram that thing through me. 
You’d make a good sheriff: kill 
first, then ask questions. 

T?ar from Having gotten His 
way to the deeper caves, Ar- 
draka threaded through a hon- 
eycomb of tunnels and chambers, 
always picking the path that 
slanted downward. Lee sensed 
that they were spiralling deeper 
and deeper into the solid rock of 
the cliffs, far below the sea level. 
The walls were crusted and a 
thick mat of dust clung to the 
ground. But everything shone 
with the same faint luminosity as 
the upper caves, and beneath the 
dust the footing felt more like 
pitted metal than rock. 

Finally Ardraka stopped. They 
were standing in the entr5rway to 
a fairly small chamber. The 
lighting was very dim. Lee stood 
behind Ardraka and felt Ardra’s 
breath on his back. 

“This is the place,” Ardraka 
said solemnly. His voice echoed 
slightly. 

They slowly entered the cham- 
ber. Ardraka walked to the far- 
thest wall and wordlessly point- 
ed to a jumble of lines scrawled 

GALAXY 



at about eye level. The cave was 
dark, but the lines of the draw- 
ing glowed slightly brighter than 
th’e wall itself. 

Gradually, Lee pieced the pic- 
ture together. It was crude, so 
crude that it was hard to under- 
stand. But there were stick fig- 
ures of men that seemed to be 
running, and rough outlines of 
what might be buildings, with 
curls of smoke rising up from 
them. Above them all were cir- 
cular things, ships, with dots for 
ports. Harsh jagged lines were 
streaking out of them and to- 
ward the stick figures. 

“Men and women,” Ardraka 
said, in a reverent whisper as he 
pointed to the stick drawings. 
“The men and women of the time 
of Ardraka’s farthest ancestors. 
And here — ” his hand flashed to 
the circles — “are the Others.” 

Even in the dim light, Lee 
could see Ardra’s face gaping at 
the picture. “The Others,” he 
said, his voice barely audible. 

“Look at Lee,” Ardraka com- 
manded bis son. “Does Lee look 
like the Others, or like a man?” 

Ardra seemed about to crum- 
ble. He said shakily, “Lee . 
Ardra has misjudged Lee. 
Ardra is ashamed.” 

“There is no shame,” Lee said. 
“Ardra has done no harm. Ardra 
was tr5dng to protect Ardraka’s 
people. And besides, you were 
right. 

FOEMAN, WHERE DO YOU FLEE? 



Turning to Ardraka, Lee ask- 
ed. “Is this all that you know ®f 
the Others?” 

“Ardraka knows that the Oth- 
ers killed the people of Ardraka’s 
forefathers. Before the Others 
came, Ardraka’s ancestors lived 
in splendor: their living places 
covered the land everywhere; 
they swam the seas without fear 
of any creature of the deeps; they 
leaped through the sky and 
laughed at the winds and storms; 
every day was bright and good 
and there was no night. Then the 
Others came and destroyed 
everything. The Others turned 
the sky to fire, and brought night. 
Only the people in the deepest 
cave survived. This was the deep- 
est cave. Only the people of Ai- 
draka escaped the Others.” 

We destroyed this world, Lee 
told himself. An interstellar war, 
eons ago. We destroyed each 
other, old man. Only you’ve been 
destroyed for good, and we clirnb- 
ed back. 

“One more thing remains,” Ar- 
draka said. He walked into the 
shadows on the other end of the 
room and pushed open a door. 
A door! It was metal, Lee could 
feel as he went past it. There 
was another chamber, larger, 

A storeroom! Shelves lined the 
walls. Most of them empty, but 
here and there were boxes, con- 
tainers, machinery with strange 
writing on it. 



45 



“TKese belonged to Ardraka’s 
oldest ancestors,” the chief said. 
“No man today knows wKy these 
things were saved Here in the 
deepest cave. They Have no pur- 
pose. They are dead. As dead as 
the people who put them Here.” 
It was Lee who was trembling 
as they made their way up to the 
dwelling caves. 

XI 

I t was a week before fie dared 
stroll the beach! at night again, 
a week of torment, even tfiough 
Ardra never, gave him the slight- 
est reason to think that He was 
still under suspicion. 

They were just as stunned as 
fie was wfien he told them about 
it. 

“We killed them,” fie wfiisper- 
ed savagely at them, back in the 
comfort of the ship. “We destroy- 
ed them. Maybe we even made 
the Pup explode, to wipe them 
out completely.” 

“That’s . farfetched,” Rass- 
mussen answered. But his voice 
sounded lame. 

“What do we do now?” 

“I want to see those artifacts.” 
“Yes, but how?” 

Lee said, “I can take you 
down to the cave, if we can put 
the whole clan to sleep for a few 
hours. Maybe gas. ...” 

“That could work,” Rassmus- 
sen agreed. 

46 



“A soporific gas?” Pascual’s 
soft tenor rang incredulously in 
Lee’s ears. “But we haven’t the 
faintest idea of how it might af- 
fect them.” 

“It’s the only way,” Lee said. 
“You can’t dig your way into the 
cave . even if you could, they 
would hear it and you’d be dis- 
covered.” 

“But gas ... it could kill them 
all.” 

“They’re all dead right now,” 
Lee snapped. “Those artifacts are 
the only possible clue to their 
early history.” 

Rassmussen decided. “We’ll do 
it.” 

Lee slept less than ever the 
next few nights, and wfien he 
did he dreamed, but no longer 
about the buildings on Titan. 
Now he dreamed of the ships of 
an ancient Earth, huge round 
ships that spat fire on the cities 
and people of Makta. He dream- 
ed of the Pup exploding and 
showering the planet with' fire, 
blowing off the atmospfiere, boil- 
ing the oceans, turning moun- 
tains into glass slag, killing every 
living thing on the surface of the 
world, leaving tlie planet bathed 
in a steam cloud, its ground rup- 
tured with angry new volcanoes. 

Tt was a rainy dark night when 
you could hardly see ten me- 
ters beyond the cave’s mouth 
that they came. Lee heard their 

GALAXY 



voices in his head as they drove 
the skimmer up onto the beach 
and clambered down from it and 
headed for the caves. Inside the 
caves, the people were asleep, 
sprawled innocently on the damp 
musty ground. 

Out of the rain a huge, bulky 
metal shape materialized, walking 
with exaggerated caution. 

“Hello, Sid,” Jerry Grote’s 
voice said in his head, and the 
white metal shape raised a hand 
in greeting. 

The Others, Lee thought as he 
watched, four more powersuited 
figures appear in the dark rain. 

He stepped out of the cave, the 
rain a cold shock to his body. 
“Bring the stuff?” 

Grote hitched a gauntleted 
thumb at one of the others. “Pas- 
cual’s got it. He’s insisting on ad- 
ministering the gas himself.” 

“Okay, but let’s get it done 
quickly, before somebody wakes 
up and spots you. Who else is 
with you?” 

“Chien, Tanaka and Stek. Ta- 
naka can help Carlos with the 
anesthetic. Chien and Stek can 
look over the artifacts.” 

Lee nodded agreement. 

Pascual and Tanaka spent 
more than an hour seeping the 
mildest soporific they know of 
through the sleeping cave. Lee

in the rain, waiting for them to 
finish. When Tanaka finally told

them it was safe to go through, 
he hurried past the sprawled 
bodies, scarcely seeing Pascual 

— still inside his cumbersome suit 

— patiently recording medical 
analyses of each individual. 

Even with the suit lamps to 
light the corridors, it was hard 
to retrace his steps dovm to the 
lowest level of the ancient shel- 
ter. But when he got to the store- 
room, Lee heard Stek break into 
a long string of Polish exultation 
at the sight of the artifacts. 

'^he three suited figures Kolo- 
graphed, x-rayed, took Taxa- 
tion counts, measured, weighed, 
every piece on the ancient 
shelves. They touched nothing di- 
rectly, but lifted each piece with 
loving tenderness in a portable 
magnetic grapple. 

“This one,” Stek told Lee, 
holding a hand-sized, oddly an- 
gular instrument in mid-air with 
the grapple, “we must take with 
us.” 

“Why?” 

“Look at it,” the physicist said. 
“If it’s not an astronautical sex- 
tant or something close to it. I’ll 
eat Charnovsky’s rocks for a 
month.” 

The instrument didn’t look im- 
pressive to Lee. It had a lens at 
one end, a few dials at the other. 
Most of it was just an angular 
metal box, with strange printing 
on it.

“You want to know where 
these people originally came 
from? ” Stek asked. “If they 
came from somewhere other than 
this planet, the information could 
be inside this instrument.” 

Lee snapped his gaze from the 
instrument to Stek’s helmeted 
face. 

“If it is a sextant, it must 
have a reference frame built in- 
to it. A tape, perhaps, that lists 
the stars that these people wanted 
to go to.” 

“Okay,” Lee said. “Take it.” 

By the time they got back up 
to the main sleeping cave and out 
to the beach again, it was full 
daylight. 

“We’ll have to keep them sleep- 
ing until almost dawn tomorrow,” 
Lee told Pascual. “Otherwise they 
might suspect that something 
unusual’s happened.” 

The doctor’s face looked con- 
cerned but not worried. “We can 
do that without harming them, I 
think. But, Sid, they’ll be very 
hungry when they awake.” 

Lee turned to Grote. “How 
about taking the skimmer out 
and stunning a couple of big fish’ 
and towing them back here to 
the shallows?” 

Grinning, Grote replied, “Hard- 
ly fair sport with the equipment 
I’ve got.” He turned and headed 
for the car. 

“Wait,” Stek called to him. 
“Give me a chance to get this 
48 



safely packed in a magnetic cas- 
ing.” And the physicist took the 
instrument off toward the skim- 
mer. 

“Sid,” Pascual said gently, “I 
want you to come back with us. 
You need a thorough medical 
check.” 

“Medical?” Lee flashed. “Or 
are you fronting for Lehman?” 
Pascual’s eyes widened with sur- 
prise. “If you had a mirror, you 
would see why I want to check 
you. You’re breaking out in skin 
cancers.” 

Instinctively, Lee looked at his 
hands and forearms. There were 
a few tiny blisters on them. And 
more on his belly and legs. 

“It’s from overexposure to the 
ultraviolet. Hatfield’s skin-dark- 
ening didn’t fully protect you.” 

“Is it serious?” 

“I can’t tell without a full ex- 
amination.” 

Just like a doctor. “I can’t 
leave now,” Lee said. “I’ve got to 
be here when they wake up, and 
make sure that they don’t sus- 
pect they’ve been visited by the 
... by us.” 

“And if they do suspect?” 

Lee shrugged. “That’s some- 
thing we ought to know, even if 
we can’t do anything about it.” 

“Won’t it be dangerous for 
you?” 

“Maybe.” 

Pascual shook his head. “You 
mustn’t stay out in the open any 

GALAXY 




longer. I won’t be responsible for 
it.” 

“Fine. Do you want me to sign 
a release form?” 

rote brought the skimmer 
back around sundown, with 
two good-sized fish aboard. The 
others got aboard around mid- 
night, and with a few final radi- 
oed words of parting, they drove 
off the beach and out to sea. 

At dawn the people woke up. 
They looked and acted complete- 
ly normally, as far as Lee could 
tell. It was one of the children 
who noticed the still-sluggish fish 
that Grote had left in a shallow 
pool just outside the line of 
breakers. Every man in the clan 
FOEMAN, WHERE DO YOU FLEE? 



splashed out, spear in hand, to 
get them. They feasted happSy 
that day. 

'^he dream was confusing. 

Somehow the towers on Ti- 
tan and the exploding star got 
mixed together. Lee saw himself 
driving a bone spear into Uie 
sleeping form of one of the na- 
tives. The man turned on &e 
ground, with the spear run 
through his body, and smiled 
bloodily at him. It was Ardraba. 

“Sid!” 

He snapped awake. It was 
dark, and the people were sleep- 
ing, full-bellied. He was slouched 
near one of the entryways to the 
main sleeping cave, at the mouth 

49 



of a tunnel leading to tlie open- 
ings in tKe cliff wall. 

“Sid, can you Hear me?” 

“Yes,” Ke whispered so low 
that he could only feel the vi- 
bration in fiis throat. 

“I’m up the beach about three 
kilometers from the relay unit. 
You’ve got to come back to the 
ship. Stek thinks he’s figured out 
the instrument.” 

Wordlessly, silently, Lee got up 
and padded through the tunnel 
and out onto the beach. The night 
was clear and bright. Dawn 
would be coming in another hour, 
he judged. The sea was calm, the 
wind a gentle crooning as it swept 
down from the cliffs. 

“Sid did you hear wHat I said? 
Stek thinks he knows what the 
instrument is for. It’s part of a 
pointing system for a communi- 
cations setup.” 

“I’m on my way.” He still 
whispered, and turned to see if 
anyone was following him. 

Grote was in a biosuit, and 
no one else was aboard the skim- 
mer. The engineer jabbered about 
Stek’s work on the instrument 
all the way back to the ship. 

Just before they arrived, Grote 
suggested, “Uh, Sid you do want 
to put on some coveralls, don’t 
you?” 

Two biosuited men were setting 
up some electronics equipment at 
the base of the ship’s largest tele- 
scopes dangling in a hoist sling 

50 



overhead, the fierce glow of Sir-* 
ius glinting off its metal barrel. 

“Stek’s setting up an experi- 
ment,” Grote explained. 

T ee was bundled into a biosuit 
' and ushered into the physi- 
cist’s workroom as soon as he set 
foot inside the ship. Stek was a 
large, round, florid man with 
thinning red hair. Lee had Hardly 
spoken to him at all, except for; 
the few hours at the cave, when 
the physicist had been encased in 
a powersuit. 

“It’s a tracker, built to find 
a star in the sky and lock onto 
it as long as it’s above the hori- 
zon,” Stek said, gesturing to the 
instrument hovering in a mag- 
netic grapple a few inches above 
his work table. 

“You’re sure of that?” Lee 
asked. 

The physicist glanced at him 
as though he had been insulting. 
“There’s no doubt about it. It’$ 
a tracker, and it probably was 
used to aim a communication an- 
tenna at their home star.” 

“And where is that?” 

“I don’t know yet. That’s why 
I’m setting up the experiment 
with the telescope.” 

Lee walked over to the work 
table and stared at the instru- 
ment. “How can you be certain 
that it’s what you say it is?” 
Stek flushed, then controlled 
himself. With obvious patience, 

GALAXY 



Ke explained. “X-ray probes 
allowed that tKe instrument con- 
tained a magnetic memory tape. 
The tape was in binary code, and 
it was fairly simple to transliter- 
ate the code, electronically, into 
tKe sEip’s main computers. We 
didn’t even Have to toucK tKe in- 
strument pHysically . except 
witK electrons.” 

Lee made an expression tKat 
showed he was duly impressed. 

Looking Happier, Stek went on, 
“TKe computer cross-cKecked tKe 
instrument’s coding and came up 
witK correlations: attitude ref- 
erences were on tKe instrument’s 
tape, and astronomical ephemer- 
ides, timing data and so fortK. 
Exactly what we’d put into a 
communications tracker.” 

“But this was made by a dif- 
ferent race of people — ” 

“It makes no difference,” Stek 
said sharply. “TKe pKysics are 
the same. TKe universe is tKe 
same. TKe instrument can only 
do tKe job it was designed to do, 
and tKat job was to track a sin- 
gle star.” 

“Only one star?” 

“Yes, that’s why I”m certain it 
was for communicating witK 
their home star.” 

“So we can find tKeir Home star 
after all.” Lee felt the old dread 
returning, but witK it something 
new, something deeper. Those 
people in the caves were our en- 
emy. And maybe their brothers,

T ee ate back at tKe Sirius globe, 

^ but Pascual insisted on his 
remaining in a biosuit until they 
Had tEorougKly checked him out. 
And they wouldn’t let him eat 
Eartfi food, altKougK tKere was as 
mucH local food as He wanted. 
He didn’t want mucH. 

“You’ve thinned out too 
mucK,” Marlene said. She was 
sitting next to him at the galley 
table. 

“Ever see a fat Sirian?” He 
meant it as a joke; it came out 
waspish'. Marlene dropped the 
subject. 

TKe wKole ship’s company 
gathered around the telescope 
and the viewscreen that would 
show an amplified picture of tKe 
telescope’s field of view. Stek 
bustled around, making last-min- 
ute checks and adjustments to 
the equipment. Rassmussen 
stood taller tKan everyone else, 
looking alternately worried and 
excited. Everyone, including Lee, 
was in a biosuit. 

Lehman showed up at Lee’s el- 
bow. “Do you think it will 
work?” 

“Driving tKe telescope front 
tKe ship’s computer’s version of 

51 



the instrument’s tape? Stek seems 
to think it’ll go all right.” 

“And you?” 

Lee shrugged. “The people in 
the caves told me what I wanted 
to know. Now this instrument 
will tell us where they came from 
originally.” 

“The homeworld of our an- 
cient enemies?” 

“Yes.” 

For once, Lehman didn’t seen! 
to be amused. “And what hap- 
pens then?” 

“I don’t know,” Lee said. 
“Maybe we go out and see if they 
are still there. Maybe we re-open 
the war.” 

If there was a war.” 

“There was. It might still be 
going on, for all we know. May- 
be we’re just a small part of it, 
a skirmish.” 

“A skirmish that wiped out 
the life on this planet,” Lehman 
said. 

“And also wiped out Earth, 
too.” 

“But what about the people on 
this planet, Sid? What about the 
people in the caves?” 

Lee couldn’t answer. 

“Do we let them die out, just 
because they might have been 
our enemies a few millenia ago.” 

“They would still be our ene- 
mies, if they knew who we are,” 
Lee said tightly. 

“So we let them die?” 

Lee tried to blot their faces 
52 



out of his mind, to erase the 
memory of Ardraka and the chil- 
dren and Ardra apologizing 
shamefully and the people fishing 
in the morning. , 

“No,” he heard himself say. 
“We’ve got to help them. They 
can’t hurt us any more, and we 
ought to help them.” 

Now Lehman smiled. 

“It’s ready,” Stek said, his 
voice pitched high with excite- 
ment. 

Sitting at the desk-sized con- 
sole that stood beside the tele- 
scope, he thumbed the power 
switch and punched a series of 
buttons. 

The viewscreen atop the desk 
glowed into life, and a swarm of 
stars appeared. With a low hum 
of power, the telescope slowly 
turned, slowly, to the left. The 
scene in the viewscreen shifted. 
Beside the screen was a smaller 
display, an astronomical map 
with a bright luminous dot show- 
ing where the telescope was aim- 
ing. 

The telescope stopped turning, 
hesitated, edged slightly more to 
the left and then made a final, 
barely discernible correction up- 
ward. 

“It’s locked on.” 

The viewscreen showed a mea- 
ger field of stars, with a single 
bright pinpoint centered exactly 
in the middle of the screen. 

“What is it, what star?” 



GALAXY 



Lee pushed forward, through 
the crowd that clustered around 
the console. 

“My God,” Stek said, Kis voice 
sounding Hollow. “That’s . the 
sun.” 

Lee felt his knees wobble. 
“They’re from Earth!” 

“It can’t be,” someone said. 
Lee shoved past the people in 
front of him and stared at the 
map. The bright dot was fixed 
on the sun’s location. 

“They’re from Earth!” He 
shouted. “They’re part of us!” 
“But how could ...” 

“They were a colony of ours,” 
Lee realized. “The Others were 
an enemy ... an enemy that 
nearly wiped them out and 
smashed Earth’s civilization back 
into a stone age. The Others 
built those damned machines on 
Titan, but Ardraka’s people did 
not. And we didn’t destroy the 
people here . we’re the same 
people!” 

“But that’s — ” 

“How can you be sure?” 

( C T T e is right,” Charnovsky 
-*■ said, his heavy bass rum- 
bling above the other voices. 
They all stopped to Hear him. 
“There are too many coincidences 
any other way. These people are 
completely human because they 
came from Earth. Any other ex- 
planation is extraneous.” 

Lee grabbed the Russian by the

shoulders. “Nick, we’ve got 
work to do! We’ve got to Help 
them. We’ve got to introduce 
them to fire, and metals and cer- 
eal grains — ” 

Charnovsky laughed. “Yes, 
yes, of course. But not tonight, 
eh? Tonight we celebrate.” 

“No,” Lee said, realizing where 
he belonged. “Tonight I go back 
to them.” 

“Go back?” Marlene asked. 

“Tonight I go back with a 
gift,” Lee went on. “A gift from 
my people to Ardraka’s. A plastic 
boat from the skimmer. That’s 
a gift they’ll be able to under- 
stand and use.” 

Lehman said, “You still don’t 
know who built the machinery on 
Titan.” 

“We’ll find out one of these 
days.” 

Rassmussen broke in, “You re- 
alize that we will Have to return 
Earthward before the next ex- 
pedition could possibly get any- 
where near Here.” 

“Some of us can wait here for 
the next expedition. I will, any- 
way.” 

The captain nodded and a slow 
grin spread across His face. “I 
knew you would even before we 
found out that your friends are 
really our brothers.” 

Lee looked around for Grote. 
“Come on, Jerry. Let’s get mov- 
ing. I want to see Ardraka’s face 
when he sees the boat. 



53 



T)ut before he saw Ardraka’s 
face, there was a moment 
when he realized what he had 
said. 

They Hadn’t learned who it was 
who had built the machines on 
Titan. All they had learned was 
that whoever those builders were, 
they had been capable of smash- 
ing a civilization fully as ad- 



vanced as Lee’s own. Millenia 
ago. 

Days later, Lee had come to 
wish that he never would find 
out the answer to his question 
about the machine-builders. 

And years later than that, he 
had the answer. And wished even 
more strongly that he hadn’t.

FORECAST 



In our companion magazine. If, we've had a policy for some years of 
encouraging new talent by publishing some of it in every issue. The If 
"Firsts" (or, as they are sometimes called, the IFirSfories) have introduced 
a fair number of bright new talents to the field of science fiction — Joseph 
Green, Larry Niven and others who you see in Galaxy these days, 
to name a few. And that's the normal S.O.P. way to do it, we think. 

So when you see a "first" author in Galaxy, rather than If, you probably 
expect something unusual. Next month we have something unusual for you. 
His name is J. R. Klugh, his story is called Golden Quicksand, and it's the 
first story he ever wrote. Jack Gaughan has done some rather unusual 
artwork for it, too. We think you'll like Golden Quicksand, and we think 
you'll be seeing more of J. R. Klugh. 

Also next month we'll be bringing another story in the trilogy that be- 
gan with Nighfwings, by Robert Silverberg. The name of it is To Jorslem, 
and it ends the pilgrimage that Nighfwings began. James Blish will be with 
us with Our Binary Brothers; Hayden Howard, who wrote the "Eskimo 
Invasion" stories a couple of years ago, begins to embroider a rich new 
tapestry with Kendy's World; Willy Ley and Algis Budrys will of course be 
back with their regular columns. 

And we will have a selection of shorts drawn from an inventory that at 
the moment includes Brian W. Aldiss, R. E. Banks, Philip K. Dick and that 
same Algis Budrys; we won't know which of them will be in next month's 
issue till we see how the type sets. Join us and see for yourself ....

THING -OF -THE - MONTH 
CLUBS 



Foreword 

F or the benefit of our mem- 
bers on Luxor, Lonestar and 
Eldorado, with tlieir average in- 
come of Cr. 27,000,000 and tax- 
laws which annually take away 
all that they haven’t managed 
to spend since last time, three 
years ago we conceived this sup- 
plementary publication and its 



resounding motto, “The more 
you spend the less you get!” 
Unfortunately there have been 
delays beyond our control in 
launching it. It was not until 
the proceeds from quadrupling 
the deluxe subscription rate to 
our regular journal GOOD BUY 
began to accumulate that we 
could even make down pay- 
ments on adequately expensive 
articles to be tested. When at 
long last we had the funds at 
our disposal, we made the dis- 
maying discovery that just about 
everything costly enough to be 
worth our attention had already 
been bought up by citizens of the 
three above-named planets. 
There is not, for example, a 
quunch machine to be had at 



55 



present for love or money; they 
are all in private hands despite 
their original price-tag of Cr. 
16,000,000; and until their build- 
ers, the Yog, cycle back into this 
part of the galaxy in about fifty 
thousand years presumably no 
more will come on the market. 

For a while we considered 
opening a special branch on Lux- 
or so that at least we could bor- 
row a few articles to test. How- 
ever, the operation of a non- 
profit organization like ours is 
strictly forbidden there, so we 
had to drop the idea. 

Now at last, though, we have 
come up with a category of serv- 
ices potentially useful to people 
hunting for ways of bleeding off 
their excess purchasing power. 
We have conducted a far more 
hasty survey of them than we 
usually do, we must admit, but 
for once we only had to apply 
a single criterion to determine 
their desirability: did they, or 
did they not, cost a hell of a lot 
for absolutely minimal return? 

Several of the following un- 
doubtedly do that, and we would 
refer you to the inside front cov- 
er for the increased subscription 
rates we have found it necessary 
to introduce as a result. 

Background 

'^hing - of - the - Month Clubs 
have a long history, stretch- 

56 



ing (according to some authori- 
ties) clear back to the Pre- Atom- 
ic dark ages. Allegedly the orig- 
inal intention was to offer ex- 
ceptional value for money, but 
it did not take long for them to 
evolve into their modern form: 
that is to say, they provide a 
captive group of potential pur- 
chasers for just about anything 
you need to get rid of in quan- 
tity. In this century, for instance, 
we have seen the Bomb-of-the 
Month Club, which enabled the 
Neo-Pacifist Party on Bellatrix 
not merely to fulfill its election 
pledges concerning general dis- 
armament but also to show a 
healthy credit balance in its first 
budget after assuming power — 
although admittedly the conse- 
quences on other planets where 
subscribers suddenly found them- 
selves in possession of the gal- 
axy’s most modern weaponry at 
a few hundred credits a throw 
were not quite so satisfactory, 
and the club had to cease oper- 
ation rather suddenly. 

We have also seen tlie Virus- 
of-the-Month Club, aimed at 
the specialized but enormous 
market of hypochondriacs who 
refused to believe their doctors 
when assured there was nothing 
wrong with them. This, however, 
suffered from excessive client 
wastage as they were compelled 
to seek ever more exotic diseases, 
and the management finally suc- 

GALAXY 



cumbed to a batch! of Glotzman’s 
Germ which was accidentally 
dropped in the packing depart- 
ment and which turned them all 
livid green with totally anky- 
losed joints. And so on. 

Few of the myriad such ven- 
tures currently advertised meet 
our basic yardstick: outlay per 
annum of not less than a mil- 
lion credits with negligible val- 
ue received. Our reports on those 
which do follow herewith. 

Test Reports 

"ll^e were naturally first at- 
~ ’ tracted to one of the long- 
est established of all TOTM 
Clubs: the JUNK-OF-THE- 

MONTH CLUB founded in 2176 
by the solitary occupant of the 
garbage-dump world Gehenna, 
Lord Albert Grease- Throgmor- 
ton. Fired with ambition to cre- 
ate the galactic counterpart of 
the sort of stately home his an- 
cestors had occupied on Earth in 
the old days, he advertised rub- 
bish for sale (his own selection) 
at a rate of Cr. 100,000 a month, 
which puts the subscription well 
above our minimum level. Owing 
to the fact that ever since the 
club’s inception all selections 
have been shipped in unscrewed 
sub-lightspeed projectiles built 
from old plastic buckets and 
soda-water syphons, there is a 
good chance that subscribers as 

THE THING-OF-THE-MONTH CLUBS 



far distant as Luxor, Lonestar 
and Eldorado will not live to see 
the delivery of their monthly 
junk. 

We must, however, warn you 
that the delay — sometimes 
amounting to centuries — be- 
tween dispatch and receipt can 
lead to one major difficulty. 
What was garbage a hundred 
years ago can easily become to- 
day’s valuable antique. One 
Croesian subscriber, for example, 
received the left hand of a stat- 
ue by Harrison Grabthrush', 
which had been missing since the 
Great Moonquake of 2206. A mu- 
seum on Grabthrash’s birthworld 
of Moralia bid Cr. 10,000,000 for 
it; the Croesian government 
promptly taxed the offer at 
500%, and the poor fellow was 
ruined. 

Another package contained a 
copy of the Forbidden Book of 
Scritch which some very strong- 
minded reader must have man- 
aged to throw away before be- 
coming caught up in its insidi- 
ous wheedling. The new owner 
was not so lucky and committed 
suicide at page 34 (held by stu- 
dents of the subject to be be- 
low average for the course; page 
66 is generally regarded as the 
breaking point). 

We can therefore only recom- 
mend the JUNK-OF-THE- 
MONTH CLUB with serious 
reservations. 



57 



The next to attract our atten- 
tion was the PLANET-OF-THE- 
MONTH CLUB, operated from 
a point close to the galactic cen- 
ter by the only race yet known 
with control over the process of 
continuous creation, the Flooge. 
Since this was by a factor of sev- 
eral hundred the most expensive 
club we Had encountered, our 
Hopes ran HigH for several weeks 
until we began to wonder why 
we were unable to trace any 
customers, satisfied or otherwise. 
We were sure that tHe club would 
not advertise on the extensive 
scale it does Had tKere not been 
significant response from human 
beings. 

Perhaps we were obtuse, but it 
took an advanced computer to 
spot what the problem is if you 
join this club. It turned out to 
be such an acute one that we did 
not ourselves feel inclined to test 
any samples of the product. 

THe trouble is, simply, storage 
space. As is usual witH these 
clubs, a premium or bonus offer 
is made to induce people to join, 
and in this case it consists of a 
small gas-giant in addition to the 
regular selection of Earth-type 
worlds. In the only case we have 
been able to document, Mrs. 
Hylla Handelstein, titular owner 
of the two largest continents on 
Freesia, decided sHe would like 
more elbow-room and duly filled 
out the application form. Her 

58 



planets were, we must admit, dis- 
patched very promptly indeed 
and we are not in any sense im- 
plying that the PLANET-OF- 
THE-MONTH CLUB is not a 
bona-fide organization. However, 
that is small comfort to Mrs. 
Handelstein and the few surviv- 
ing inhabitants of Freesia — the 
gas-giant has already dragged 
away ninety per cent of its at- 
mosphere, and tides and earth- 
quakes are seriously hampering 
evacuation. 

If you must join this club, we 
advise giving an address in an 
uninhabited system. 

\ somewhat more innocuous 
undertaking might appear 
to be the MASTERPIECE-OF- 
THE-MONTH CLUB, which op- 
erates on a round-robin basis 
and requires members to dis- 
patch their monthly selection, af- 
ter four weeks of enjoyment, to 
the next person on the list. This 
too, though, has certain draw- 
backs. Despite an enormous 
backlog of original masterpieces 
to draw on (the Club was in- 
stituted to make amends for the 
depredations of the trillionaire 
art thief Jeremiah Gung-ho Wa- 
terboy, who, as is well known, 
contrived during his century and 
a half of operation to transfer 
the entire contents of the Brit- 
ish Museum, the Louvre, the 
Guggenheim and the Leningrad 

GALAXY 



Hermitage to his private estate 
on Rafflesworld, replacing each 
item with a virtually perfect copy 
to escape detection) the member- 
ship Has recently expanded to the 
point where non-human master- 
works have been introduced to 
supplement the existing stocks. 

Whatever the pleasure to be 
derived from a month’s contem- 
plation of the Mona Lisa or the 
Elgin Marbles, we do not feel 
that it adequately compensates 
for the experience of one of our 
test panel, who was sent as his 
very first selection a flaying-ma- 
chine by the great Skrinnian art- 
ist Three-and-a-half Ug. Admit- 
tedly it was of exquisite crafts- 
manship and unparalleled pre- 
cision; nonetheless, human be- 
ings do not count the removal of 
their epidermis according to pre- 
determined symbolic patterns 
among the art-forms they are 
capable of appreciating. (We are 
glad to rejfcrt that our tester is 
expected to leave the hospital 
soon.) 

Administrative oversights of a 
similar nature likewise prevent 
us from unreservedly recom- 
mending the MATE-OF-THE- 
MONTH CLUB. We would 
stress that racial prejudice has 
absolutely nothing to do with our 
opinion no organization with 
chapters among as many differ- 
ent species as has ConGalFed- 
ConAss could possibly be open 

THE THING-OF-THE-MONTH CLUBS 



to that charge. Nor are we square, 
or prissy; we fully recognize 
that people’s tastes vary very 
widely, and they should be free 
to indulge them provided they 
neither interfere with others 
against their will nor disturb the 
galactic peace. 

However, we do feel that the 
warning about the penalty for 
non-consummation which is in- 
cluded in the MATE-OF-THE- 
MONTH CLUB’S advertise- 
ments should be supplemented 
by a clause concerning non-con- 
sumption. It was only with the 
greatest difficulty that the fe- 
male members of our testing pan- 
el extricated themselves from the 
embrace of their respective se- 
lections for the first month of 
their trial membership, and in 
two or three cases quite extensive 
surgery was called for. 

The selection for that month 
Happened to be Voracian male, 
and Voracians — as we were not 
informed by the instruction leaf- 
let — have habits which consti- 
tute a sort of mirror-image of 
those of the Black Widow spi- 
ders. In other words, the male 
achieves climax by ingesting his 
partner. Luckily, the average 
size of this species is only about 
half a meter, and their capacity 
is accordingly rather limited. 
Nonetheless, we exercised our 
option to discontinue member- 
ship after an initial trial and 

59 



were glad of the chance to do 
so, as we had been threatened 
with mass resignations by all 
our testers. 

A new venture, announced a 
few month’s ago by the PET- 
OF - THE - MONTH CLUB, 
brought them also into our range. 
They are now operating an ul- 
tra-de-luxe category of member- 
ship for those wishing to own 
exceptionally large pets. The 
idea would seem an admirable 
one; regrettably, our own experi- 
ence has not borne it out in 
practice. 

The first selection we received 
was a Tyrocdon from Haglith’s 
World, a rather beautiful crea- 
ture standing some twelve meters 
tall and covered with glistening 
red and yellow scales. The dietary 
instructions furnished with it, 
however, proved to refer to the 
previous selection, a regular Af- 
rican elephant, and by the time 
we discovered that Tyrocdons 
subsist exclusively on fluorspar, 
the beast had felt the first pangs 
of hunger. This was fatal . , 
or very nearly so. When they’re 
hungry, Tyrcodons emit a howl- 
ing noise in the low supersonic 
range at sufficient strength to 
bring down the average Earth- 
side city-block. Fortunately, ex- 
perience in the past had per- 
suaded us to establish our test- 
ing-labs in a block reinforced 

60 



against anything short of major 
meteorite impact, but the conse- 
quences might have been alarm- 
ing. 

And our second selection turn- 
ed out to be a Gigas whale, 
whose natural environment is a 
deep ammonia-methane ocean 
with a pressure of about 100 
kg./sq. cm. at -230° C. When 
opened inadvertently to Earth- 
normal pressure and tempera- 
ture, the creature burst and 
showered long and disgusting 
strands of its internal organs all 
over ever 3 Twhere. We have ceded 
the balance of our membership 
to an impecunious zoo on Penny- 
wise and hope that the proceeds 
from later exhibitions of the se- 
lections will cover the suit being 
brought against us for creating 
a health hazard in Greater 
Greater New York. 

A club which struck us as very 
promising but which is sus- 
pended at the time of writing 
for reasons detailed below is 
the PERSONALITY-OF-THE- 
MONTH CLUB, a venture 
launched on Schizophrenia but 
already so successful as to have 
attracted members on over twen- 
ty planets. Members receive a 
printed-molecule brain-program 
and an automatic imposer worn 
over the scalp (wigs are offered 
as an optional extra to conceal 
the device in use). So long as 

GALAXY 



the imposer remains in position, 
the wearer’s personality is alter- 
ed towards a desired character 
chosen from a wide range in- 
deed — currently more tiian 
three thousand choices. 

As we said above, However, 
the club is temporarily suspend- 
ed owing to a legal dispute. The 
population of a certain town on 
Puritania joined the club virtu- 
ally en masse, and in a single 
month ninety-two per cent of the 
male residents chose the Casa- 
nova program, while eigHty-six 
per cent of the female residents 
selected the corresponding Mes- 
salina program. Owing to this 
imbalance between male and fe- 
male, fierce rivalry developed 
over the favors of the available 
ladies and so many duels were 
fought in the first week that the 
planetary government was com- 
pelled to step in. The survivors, 
deprived of their imposers, nat- 
urally reverted to the normal 
customs of their world and at the 
time of writing there are factori- 
al-17,321 divorce suits pending, 
sufficient — according to our 
computers — to occupy the en- 
tire time of the Puritanian courts 
until well into the next universal 
cycle. Unofficial sources suggest 
that the government, faced with 
this problem, plans to change the 
name of its world to Saturnalia 
and give up, but we have been 
unable to confirm the rumor. 

THE THING-OF-THE-MONTH CLUBS 



A club which has memberslup 
fees well below our minimum 
standard, but which involves in- 
cidental outlay bringing the to- 
tal cost considerably above it, 
is the HATRED -OF -THE - 
MONTH CLUB. This operates 
on a principle related to that of 
the last-mentioned club, but in- 
stead of an imposer an injection 
of programmed RNA is employ- 
ed to induce temporary detesta- 
tion of items from an imagina- 
tively chosen list. Among other 
things which our test-panel sam- 
pled, we would cite plate-glass 
windows, water-sculpture, plas- 
tic minijerkins, autojazz genera- 
tors, and (perhaps most useful 
of all for our purposes) money^ 

As you will doubtless have re- 
alized, though, it’s the l^al 
costs which increase the expen- 
ditxue of this club so substan- 
tially, and we can only recom- 
mend it to people who have time 
to spare for frequent appear- 
ances in court.

Illustrated by BLAKELY 



There was nothing like Raceworld 
before the Solferrans. No others 
had such need to improve the breed. 



I 

tCT^eeb’y VAAAAL ya!” 

The best-known cry in 
Galactica floated up through Pe- 
ter Christmas’s office window. 
The big brown man let his eyes 
stray from the tridi to the scene 
below. 

A gaggle of little dinosaurs 
were streaking by the stands, 



their jewelled Hides flashing in 
the light of Raceworld’s morn- 
ing. Raceworld! Christmas’s jaw 
softened briefly. He turned back 
to his visitor, who was furling 
and unfurling himself irritably 
on the courtesy perch. 

“But is not flying! On Xemos 
we do not call this flying!” 

“Mr. Porridan,” Christmas 
said, “it’s not a question ©f be- 



63 



ing able to fly well, of being 
able to fly over mountains and 
so on. If you wisH to enter your 
animals in tKe Non-Flying Avian 
classes, tfiey must not fly at all. 
No flapping, no gliding even for 
a few steps. Look at tKat fellow 
tliere!” 

He pointed to tKe tridi wKere 
a large ostricK-like fowl was 
brandisKing his pinions and loft- 
ing Kimself easily as he pranced 
about. Porridan’s vaguely human 
face took on an insulted air, like 
a dog rejecting inferior biscuits. 

“Mr. Porridan, do you realize 
what would happen if your en- 
try did that during a race? First, 
it would be disqualified, and you 
would lose your entry fee and 
costs, not to mention wKat Race- 
world would lose in compensat- 
ing the mutuels. Second, you 
would undoubtedly get a judg- 
ment for fouling and damages 
by some of the other contest- 
ants, which would come out of 
your planetary bond. Thirdly, 
somebody might get hurt, which 
means really expensive repara- 
tions, and of course I, as Chief 
Steward, would be responsible for 
an improper ruling. It happened 
once a long while back when we 
weren’t so careful. An entry with 
hidden inflatable vanes got into 
the NFA sulky class and the 
cursed thing took off over the 
finish line — with the sulky — 
and not only injured three other; 

64 



drivers but crashed in the stands. 
Nearly five million credits to 
settle that one — Excuse me a 
moment.” 

He turned to Kis chiming in- 
tercom. 

“Yes, Hal? Fine, I’ll lift the 
quarantine right away. No, for 
Solsake, Hal, I’ve told you a 
jillion times better ten false 
alarms than one epizootic. You 
call ’em as you see ’em. I’ll back 
you if I have to isolate every 
animal on the planet. Wait, Hal, 
I have a problem with an NFA 
entry that’s going to need belly 
straps. The planet rep claims 
it’ll upset His birds, they won’t 
run with straps. His birds are 
coming in on MT today about 
second period. Can you meet the 
rep there and work something 
out? Porridan — no, P as in 
problem. From Xemos Three, 
right? Thanks, Hal. 

“TKat was our chief veterina- 
rian, Mr. Porridan — Doctor La- 
mont. La-mont. He will meet you 
when your bird comes through', 
and I know he will find a solu- 
tion.” 

Y T is visitor was snuffling 
through his dewlaps. 

“Something which will permit 
your splendid animals to display 
their magnificent running abil- 
ity before the eyes of the whole 
Galaxy,” Christmas added hope- 
fully. “They’re great birds, Mr. 

GALAXY 



Porridan. Believe me, Raceworld 
wants to show them at their best 
as much as you do.” 

“We of the poor backward 
worlds meet with humiliations 
from the so-called fair play of 
the Galactic Imperialists!” Por- 
ridan wailed. “Because we are 
poor you insult our culture!” 

He flung his shoulder mem- 
branes over his head, dislodging 
several diamond ear-clips which' 
rolled on the floor. Christmas 
helped retrieve them. 

After Porridan had counted 
them, Christmas said, “There’s 
one other little matter. Sir. The 
bursar is rather puzzled over an 
entry in your cost sheet. Could 
you give us some clarification on 
the, ah, auxiliary animals item?” 

“But we were guaranteed free 
transport,” Porridan shrilled. 
“Are we now to be cheated here, 
too?” 

“Not at all, Mr. Porridan:, 
please calm yourself. As you 
said. Gal Q offers free matter 
transport and lodging to any 
planet wishing to send an entry 
to Raceworld, up to a certain 
mass. That includes the compet- 
ing animals, plus trainers, jock- 
eys or drivers, veterinary, and so 
on, plus food and supplies as ap- 
propriate. The auxiliary animals 
category is intended to cover 
certain cases where the racers re- 
quire other animals, such as their 
young, or biological symbiotes, 

PARIMUTUEL PLANET 



or even mascots or imprinted mh 
imals, for their well-being. But 
we do require a word of explaa- 
ation when the shipment runs aS 
high as yours — that is, two 
hundred auxiliaries. Just what 
are these extra animals, Mr. P«Mf- 
ridan?” 

Porridan had furled himseK SO 
that only his large aggrieved eyes 
were visible. 

“Female animals,” Ke said 
coldly. 

“Oh, but I see some of your 
racing birds are female . what 
species are these other females?” 
Porridan shrugged. “Just fe- 
males.” 

“You mean female Xemoji-i 
ans? Like you?” 

“Females are not people!” 

“In other words, these females 
are not for the animals but for 
the training staff, right? But you 
have only twenty male person- 
nel. Do these females performi 
any service in connection wittj 
the racing animals?” 

“Of course not. What could 
they do?” 

<4T see. Mr. Porridan, I deplore 
-^having to pry like this, but 
you must see this is a fantastic 
expense to Gal Q. Transporting 
mass from your position at the 
rim is — ” 

“Ah! Again you insult us be- 
cause we are far away and back- 
ward !” 

65 



“Mr. Porridan, no one is in- 
sulting you. It’s a question of fair 
play. What would all the other 
planetary teams say if we let you 
bring in ten females for every 
trainer and driver?” 

“Ten females are not for train- 
ers and drivers!” Porridan squeal- 
ed. Refurling himself furiously, 
he started for the door. “You in- 
sult even our intimate life! Xe- 
mosian females are not for dis- 
cussion! This is too much! The 
Treaty of Xemos can be reopen- 
ed! Poor as we are, we can still 
die for our honor!” 

“Mr. Porridan, wait!” 

The door slammed. Christmas 
blew an imaginary fly off his 
blunt nose, pushed one hand 
through his reddish wool and 
stabbed his male secretary’s sig- 
nal. 

“I’m here, PC,” said a cheerful 
otterlike being, from the side 
door. 

“Dana, tell the Secretariat 
that Xemos has blown his wig 
again, and they better get some- 
one after him to oil him down. 
Lamont will take care of the en- 
try ruling, but get Brooksie on- 
to the sex situation on Xemos — 
especially the standard mating 
ratios and female status, Porri- 
dan claims their females aren’t 
people, and he needs a couple of 
hundred of them, mostly for the 
team chiefs, I gather. I’m sure 
it’s a phony, but check it out, 

66 



vidll you? And what are these?” 

“The ruling on the squid pro- 
pellant situation, PC. We finally 
got agreement: All contestant^ 
will submit to ink-sac removal, 
but riders must wear masks ca- 
pable of filtering legitimate meta- 
bolic products. We do the cheiri 
anal.” 

“How about the I.Q. business? 
Are those Deneb squids animals, 
or do they go over to Galsports as 
people?” 

“Not yet clear, PC, We could 
get a ruling on the squids, but a 
mammalian group has injected it- 
self into the question. They claim, 
any contestant capable of using 
a stop-watch isn’t an animal.” 

“Whose animals are using stop- 
watches?” 

“That Flanigan outfit. Light 
equinoids.” 

“Hey, Flange is one of the 
teams in the class that’s been: 
having so many long shot wins. 
The Stat people from Mutuel 
put me onto last night. They’ve 
had Lamont running covert met- 
abolic tests on the whole field 
... I wonder — “ 

He punched his intercom sav- 
agely, and the mournful face of 
his security came on. 

“Kurtis? Can you put a total 
snoop on the Flange delegation 
right away? Light Horses. Yes, 
especially I want the stables, tfie 
animals. Sound, pictures, even 
smells if you have to. FTL prior- 

GALAXY 



ity, around the clock, too, until 
we get something. Oh, just a 
hunch, but it could be nasty — 
that’s right, like the old Pyrrh’oxa 
mess. You know what to look 
for. Thanks, Kurt.” 

C hristmas sighed. The reputa- 
tion of Raceworld, Inc. — 
Inc. for Incorruptible — rested 
heavy on his shoulders. 

“There’s another thing,” said 
Dana, thoughtfully flicking a 
black tongue around his beauti- 
ful cream muzzle. “Maybe noth- 
ing to it, but that new Ankru 
team that started yesterday has 
won two of their first three starts. 
All in different classes. One herbi- 
amph, a carnii-mammal and an 
N.F.A. The N.F.A. came in sec- 
ond.” 

“Dana, your hunches are gold- 
en. I’ll never forget that alleged 
herbivorous Capellan thing that 
would have eaten our starter . 
When’s Ankru running next?” 
“Just coming up, PC. Giant 
armored reps on the main track.” 
“Could I sneak down and take 
a look?” 

Dana’s bristles twitched at the 
big human’s cublike eagerness. 

“Okay, but remember the Gal 
Q conference in Half a unit — 
PC, please keep your caller 
open.” 

Christmas blew joyfully as He 
wrestled the commocollar onto 
his thick neck and stepped out 

PARIMUTUEL PLANET 



onto the balcony to mount his 
airsled. Raceworld! His Race- 
world. His broad nose vn'inkled 
in the spicy breeze from a thou- 
sand racetracks on which ran, 
hopped, flopped, swam, slithered, 
humped, darted and thundered 
the racing beasts of a million 
planets. Raceworld the perfect 
planet, turning stately through 
equal hours of flawless day and 
balmy floodlit night. Her utter- 
ly predictable climate graded 
smoothly from equator to pole, 
and offered every oxygen-breath- 
er its natural optimum. 

Directly in front of Christmas’s 
equatorial headquarters lay the 
major track for the most spectac- 
ular of all races — the giant ar- 
mored reptiles, general Gal- 
axy favorites. Other hot-climate 
beasts ran here too; big cats, sa- 
vannah ungulates, and giant in- 
sects and arachnoids. The left 
horizon was mountains, holding 
the canyons, pylons and air- 
borne stands of the flighted 
races. On his right glittered the 
sea world where aquatic forms 
competed. Beyond the track in 
front was a great hotel and rec- 
reation complex, and beyond 
that, stretching around the plan- 
et’s curve, lay the special-atmos- 
phere domes and exotic courses 
where indescribable creatures 
met to dig or spin or spit or dis- 
play whatever competitive frenzy 
their home worlds had developed

as sport. All for the honor of 
those home worlds — and inci- 
dentally to the honor and profit 
of Raceworld and its Solterran 
staff- 

II 

C hristmas cast an eye up to 
the commo satellite — “the 
eyes of the Galaxy are upon 
you!” — and checked his chro- 
nometer. He let his airsled settle 
into the main track infield, past 
the vast mutuel boards, which 
were showing a Myrian entry as 
favorite. He turned his glasses 
on the backstretch where the gi- 
ant reptiles were warming up, 
making the ground quake. The 
polished bodies blazed, the riders 
almost invisible behind fantas- 
tically assorted shoulder-plates. 
“Great sight, isn’t it, Sir?” 
Christmas recognized the tall 
ebony boy as one of Hal La- 
ment’s veterinary internes. They 
leaned together on the rail to 
watch a rider tr3dng to control 
lus mount’s tendency to thrash 
a ten-ton tail. The rider, an ar- 
thropod type from around Sirius, 
Christmas guessed, worked fev- 
erishly with his string-straps on 
the creature’s hind brain. Christ- 
mas’ main interest, the Ankru 
entry, was a low-slung, nonde- 
script red beast whose huge 
wither-fan concealed his jockey. 
The first brush was over, and 

PARIMUTUEL PLANET 



the field began to fall in behind 
the tremendous scaffolds of the 
traveling start-gate. 

“The Field is in Motion!” A 
roar came from tKe stands. Gal- 
axy-wide betting was always 
Heavy for this one. 

The arthopod went by in pole 
position, still making adjust- 
ments. Number Two was the 
Myrian favorite, a towering green 
monster with a slobbering trunk 
of a head thirty feet off the 
ground. Its rider gleamed white 
as they passed — apparently a 
human girl. 

Dust hit the rest, and Christ- 
mas headed back to the finish- 
line, circling the boards at ground 
level since it was illegal to fly 
during a race. He was grinning at 
himself for pretending to check 
up in person when the tridi 
tapes would show him every de- 
tail. 

A confused booming filled the 
air as the field came around the 
last turn. The green Myrian was 
in the lead, fighting off the bid 
of a yellow monster with a ten- 
foot frill on its jaws. Red Ankru 
was holding back in mid-field; 
Christmas could see steam as the 
rider held coolant on its rump. 

The stands were rising and howl- 
ing — the ground thrummed un- 
der the punishment of twenty- 
ton drumsticks — scales flashed 
through the dust kicked up by 
the great splay feet. In the glit- 

69 



ter and rush of enormous bod- 
ies, Christmas saw the Myrian 
girl going to her heat-straps. The 
yellow challenger had faded, and 
now a long brown neck was lung- 
ing up. rhe green behemoth be- 
gan to pull ahead, and the field 
was almost upon him when he 
caught the boom-boom boom of 
an animal coming up fast on the 
outside. It was red Ankru, lev- 
elled out to rocket speed. The 
stands exploded — the girl work- 
ed madly — but the low red mon- 
ster barrelled first across the line, 
its rider popping up and down 
like a ping-pong ball between the 
thrashing withers. Christmas 
sledded along for a closer look. 

“Sir! Sir! Look out — the girl 
— stop her!” 

^^he voice of the young in- 
terne blasted his collar^ 
Christmas turned, saw the green 
saurian now riderless, his long 
neck bent to a figure in the dust. 
The girl’s pale arms were up, 
and between them was a glint of 
metal. Christmas lobbed his sled 
over the rail and tumbled off 
with a fist around her wrists. 

She didn’t struggle. Closed 
eyes in her upturned face open- 
ed to stare wildly at him, her 
mou'^h ceased whispering and 
fell open too. Her rvrists were like 
icy twigs. Christmas gently dis- 
engaged the three-foot razor- 
bright sword. 

70 



“No. no. no,” he Lold her, urg- 
ing her up. She rose shakily — 
eight feet tall, skinny and naked 
as a fork, except for a crimson 
sword-belt ''round her navel. 
She had no body hair, end one 
breast had been removed. 

“Oy ban s’ered warro vergan 
f’Myria!” she protested, reaching 
for the sword. 

“Anybody know what she’s 
saying?” Christmas fended her 
off. 

“She says she’s a sacred war- 
rior ^'irgin from Myria,” the 
young interne panted. “She has 
to kill herself because she lost 
the race.” 

“Oh, now, she can’t do that. 
Tell her she must ride in other 
races and win.” 

“Oy ban s’ered warro vergan 
f’ Myria,” the girl repeated. 

“Ser Nisrair from Oal Q is on 
the way in,” said Dana’s voice in 
his collar. 

“You — Doctor What’s-your- 
name — Ooloolulloolah? — get 
her over to Infirmary, vsdll you?” 

As he turned to go the girl 
screemed like a peahen and 
grabbed for vhe sword. Instinc- 
tively he raised it overhead. By- 
standers goggled and backed 
from the odd tableau. 

“You can have it if you swear 
not to harm yourself. Tell her, 
Doc, make her swear, right?” 

The girl knelt and began to 
recite in a high' treble. 



GALAXY 



“Ser Nisrair is here, PC,” said 
his collar. Christmas peeled her 
arms off his knees, tossed the 
sword of the interne and took 
off in a zoom for the balcony. 
He stepped into His office just 
as Dana was ushering the Gal 
Q liaison officer through the 
king-sized folding doors. Ser Nis- 
rair’s steel-blue carapace towered 
over Christmas. 

tt/^ood morning Peter,” Nis- 
rair intoned melodiously, 
retracting his lower limbs so that 
he rested on his edge at man- 
height. Like all the Gal Center 
people he exuded a firm benev- 
olence which made Christmas 
overact a bit. 

“Hi, Ser. How are the Magel- 
lans doing? I take it that’s what 
you came to discuss?” 

“Very true, Peter,” beamed 
Nisrair, as though he were giv- 
ing Christmas an A in fractions. 
“We are, as you know, showing 
them over Raceworld since they 
expressed an interest during 
their recent tour of Galactic Cen- 
ter.” 

“Primitive of them,” Christ- 
mas murmured. He knew Gal 
Center took a slightly patronizing 
view of Raceworld — “our 
charming toy” — although they 
were keenly aware of Race- 
world’s use in helping cement 
the million-planet federation. 

“What have they seen?” 



“We took them to North Pole 
yesterday for Communications 
and the Galactic computer.” 
Surprisingly, all four of Nisrair’s 
eyestalks turned on Christmas* 
“It is a little difficult, Peter . 
Nothing seems to interest them. 
They are so very different . 
and it is so very important that 
we establish at least a little rap- 
port.” 

His antennae were in rigid for- 
mal position. The big bug is really 
worried, Christmas thought. 

Reassuringly he said, “Some- 
thing here is bound intwiggle 
them, Ser, it’s worked on every 
visitor so far. Even if they’re 
from another galaxy, they can’t 
be all that different. So the hard- 
ware didn’t fascinate them; may- 
be the economics of the galactic 
betting system will. Or the Sec- 
retariat’s display of xenobiology 
and alien housekeeping. After 
all, our galaxy is bigger than the 
Clouds; the sheer size and range 
of it all is bound to be impres- 
sive. 

“And if that fails, there’s al- 
ways the psy-math boys down at 
Pole South, forecasting the re- 
sults of their own forecasts. Re- 
member, that’s what finally lured 
those dematerialized clots from 
the Horsehead into the Federa- 
tion?” 

“I hope so, Peter . They are 
very powerful, you know. Their 
equipment — very advanced.” 



PARIMUTUEL PLANET

|3ig man and bigger coleopte- 
ran eyed each other in word- 
less unity. No one spoke of the 
possibility of intergalactic war 
resulting from First Contact. 

“I’U do anything I can, Ser, 
you know that.” 

“I was going to say ... if 
they express some desire, no mat- 
ter how unorthodox — ” 

“Anything at all, Ser. They can 
break all the rules.” 

“Thank you.” Ser hoisted his 
bulk and paused before the bal- 
cony on his way out. “Delight- 
ful,” he murmured, again avun- 
cularly bland. “Always an idyUic 
interlude to visit here. You lead 
an Arcadian life, Peter.” 

“Kurtis called, PC,” said Dana, 
as usual slipping in before Christ- 
mas could signal. “He has the 
net on the Flange team going, 
but there’s nothing to report yet 
except that the drivers seem to 
be playing some game with their 
toes.” 

“How Arcadian,” Christmas 
grunted. 

“Also, there’s a complaint 
from one of the big cat teams. 
They claim the target doesn’t 
look human enough, their beast 
won’t chase it.” 

“Pass that one to Detweiler; 
that’s a Secretariat problem . 
Oh! On your Ankru hunch: Run 
me the tridis of all their animals, 
will you? That giant rep win 
makes them three out of four 



now — all in two days. I think 
you’ve got something.” 

The Ankru entries came on his 
screen; the red Tyrannosaur type 
Christmas had seen, then a bur- 
ly-legged running bird, and a 
tufted cheetah-like affair with a 
build like a rope slung between 
two stumps, and finally a slimy- 
looking tub of a thing which ap- 
parently navigated on a broad 
keel, propelled by paddles. 

“That’s the herbivorous am- 
phibian,” Dana said. The herbi- 
amph opened one yawning end 
at the camera. 

“High-gravity builds. I’d say,” 
Christmas mused. “Call Lament 
and tell him to run a covert 
check on their grav cornpensa- 
tors for starters. It could be they 
have found a way to screw up 
their handicap. Oh — and while 
you’re onto him, get that report 
on the compound life-swarm gee- 
hinkus from the Coalsack, will 
you? Detwieler’s shop should 
never have put it in the social 
insect classes; we’ve had two 
complaints of fouling — ” 

III 

B OOM! BOO-O-O-O-M-M- 

M-M! ! ! ! 

The resounding overhead 
thunder sent them both jumping 
for the balcony, to be greeted by 
a sight they had seen only on his- 
toritapes — a blazing rocket ex- 



72 



GALAXY 



haust wavering down to land 
beyond the Hotels. CKristmas 
stared. Behind him the innercom 
was yammering. 

“ — unauthorized landingl Re- 
peat, red alert, unidentified alien 
landing — ” It was the voice of 
the Gal Q security satellite. 

“PC! A rocket’s coming down 
on my minirodent tracks!” 
screamed a soprano. 

Christmas vaulted onto his 
sled. “Get a firescreen over those 
rats, Dana!” He took off, barely 
noticing that Dana had pushed 
something into his hand. 

As he cleared the hotel domes, 
he saw the alien ship squatting 
in a volcano of smoke. The fire- 
boys howled past, foam jets 
reaching for the intruder. The 
blaze was plastered down by the 
time Christmas skidded to a stop. 
Kurtis’s blue prowler whined in 
behind him. The security chief 
was whispering orders into his 
collar. He raised a finger at 
Christmas without taking his 
eyes off the alien ship. 

The foam around the ship was 
wriggling. Minirodents, ludi- 
crously be-foamed, were dashing 
in all directions, many without 
jockeys. 

“Lily! Lily — are you all 
right?” Christmas called, and 
saw his assistant steward rise 
up from under an overturned 
stand, wiping gobs of foam off 
her face. The minirodents rushed 



for Her, formed a solid pile 
around Her feet and scrambled 
onto Her shoulders and Head. 

TKe alien’s port swung open to 
a ramp. Three squat figures like 
blond chimpanzees peered out 
through the fading smoke. Then 
one, flamboyantly imiformed, 
strode onto the ramp, tossed His 
yellow mop out of his eyes, and 
gave out a ringing ululation end- 
ing in an interrogative note. 

“Voder’s coming in a minute,” 
Kurtis said. “Look at those side 
arms — what the holy Galaxy 
are they, space opera?” 

The alien caterwauled again. 
Christmas, realizing he was the 
only official there, stepped for- 
ward, holding up his hand. 

On the alien ramp, the figure 
stared at him, tossed his head 
again, and all three of them duck- 
ed back inside. Christmas stop- 
ped. Gal Q and the Secretary 
would be there in a minute from 
the far side of Admin. There was 
a siren roar from inside the 
spaceboat, and the three emerged 
again, wheeling what looked like 
surrealistic airsleds bigger than 
themselves and decked with grill- 
es, pipes and streamers. The 
leader yawped at Christmas, 
who held up his hand again. 

Quddenly all three aliens jam- 
^ med horned helmets on their 
heads, sprang onto their ma- 
chines, and took off in thunder. 

73 



PARIMUTUEL PLANET 



They circled their craft at eye- 
level, making everyone duck, 
and then began doing aerobatics. 
At that moment, Secretary Det- 
weiler’s sled come over the Ho- 
tel. The aliens brayed and began 
looping and crowding him, with 
ear-splitting blasts from their 
machines. 

Kurtis had taken off in pur- 
suit. Christmas got airborne 
just in time to see what looked 
like a laser beam coming from 
the aliens. Yes! In the name of 
madness, it was a laser. Det- 
weiler’s sled Had sagged side- 
ways, and Kurtis was throwing 
up his screens. Christmas put up 
his own, becoming vaguely aware 
that he had a minirodent on his 
head. He gained altitude and 
gave chase. 

The aliens were now circling 
a cluster of M/T masts, firing at 
the rigging, but Kurtis was on 
top of them. Christmas saw him 
nail one with come-along spray 
and then miss another, who dart- 
ed toward Christmas. The thing 
Dana had given him had turned 
out to be a hand stunner. Christ- 
mas picked off the alien at low 
power as he went by, and saw 
him go into a long glide to the 
beach. Kurtis, followed docile- 
ly by the come-alonged alien, 
was turning tight circles on the 
last rider’s tail, forcing him down 
away from his ship. 

Christmas got the minirodent’s 

74 



tail out of his eye and started 
back to the alien boat. Ambu- 
lance crews were converging, and 
Detweiler’s sled had limped in. 

Suddenly the last alien dou- 
bled and streaked for his ship at 
ground level, his laser beam loop- 
ing wildly. 

“Down! Everybody down!” 
Christmas bellowed and made for 
the melee. The alien had almost 
gained his ramp, when he slump- 
ed off his machine and fell in- 
to the foam. His sled crashed in- 
to the ship wall and fell beyond 
him. 

Lily, Christmas’s assistant, 
emerged from under the ramp, 
making cooing noises to the min- 
irodents clinging to her. On her 
head, one of the rodent jockeys 
was bolstering a tiny hand-gun. 

“Snedecor got him, PC! Sne- 
decor got him!” Lily yelled. 

Kurtis and the now zombie- 
like alien had landed. The voder 
crew came up. 

“Snedecor got him!” Lily car- 
olled. 

“What in creation were they 
trying?” Christmas asked. 

The security chief glowered 
sadly at his captive, now being 
hooked up to the voder. 

“We’ll know shortly,” he said. 
“Some bunch of flipping primi- 
tives who heard we had races, 
is my guess. Who’s Snedecor?” 

On Lily’s head, Snedecor bow- 
ed and waved composedly. 

GALAXY 



“Good shooting. But what’s 
that mouse doing with side- 
arms?” 

“Old ruling — all beings less 
than nine centims high author- 
ized to carry non-lethal defense,” 
said Christmas. “Hello, Det. 
Glad you’re okay. Well, I guess 
the rest of this is your job. Let 
me know the score, Lily, I’ve got 
to get back. Oh — here.” 

T Te disengaged the minirodent 
and handed it over. “Did 
anyone ever tell you you have 
an idyllic job?” 

He zoomed for home, pausing 
to let another lizard race finish 
before he crossed the tracks. 
“Machines . racing with ma- 
chines ...” he muttered, his 
big shoulders twitching. He float- 
ed over the shouts, the flashing 
scales and silks, the joyous com- 
motion. Dana met him on the 
balcony with a tray. 

“Good, what is it?” He de- 
manded, his nose in a beaker 
of Infield ale. 

“Don’t ask. Lamont sent it. 
His reward for saving something 
that broke a leg; he has a 
freezer full.” 

“I didn’t know we had a stun- 
ner, Dana.” 

“You don’t. I do. Kurtis gave 
it to me last year. Remember 
those Altaireans who wanted to 
duel to the death in your office? 
Kurt says you have illusions of 

PARIMUTUEL PLANET 



invulnerability.” Dana’s bristles 
curled in a grin. 

“Well, it paid off. Another of 
your himches ... Yes, Hal?” he 
said to the intercom. “Indeed 
we did have a little excitement. 
How’re the rats? Ah, too bad. 
Rotten shame, who could fore- 
see it? Great idea of yours, put- 
ting drugs in the firefoam . 
Anything on the Ankru grav 
check yet?” 

“Their gravity compensators 
are absolutely correct,” Lamont 
told him. “Right on the nose at 
one point two. Funny thing, 
they look like really high G types 
to me, too. And I’ll tell you an- 
other funny thing — they’re ex- 
ercising some of their animals 
under double grav loading. Of 
course there’s no law against add- 
ing more G’s, but they’re being 
very quiet about it. I’d say you 
have got the answer — there’s 
a mistake in the handicapping 
from Detweiler’s shop.” 

“That could be ugly, Hal. Who 
made the mistake, and why?” 

“I hadn’t thought of that,” 
Lamont said slowly. He frown- 
ed. 

“Well, it’s not your screaming 
baby. How did things go with 
the Xemos Three birds?” 

“Thank you for nothing, PC. 
No question, those things fly. I 
suggested nerve blocks or tem- 
porary pinions, and he frothed. 
We settled on a special strap 

75 



job after I sHowed him that oth- 
er contestants used them. Prob- 
ably intends to sabotage the 
straps — better put a watdi-note 
on him. But listen, PC, did you 
know Ke Had copper spurs on 
those birds as long as your arm? 
Slice a leg right off, like a saber. 
We had another scene when I 
told him they’d have to go. It 
seems they have some bosom en- 
emy here they’ve got to beat, 
preferably fatally. You better 
alert the equipment boys. He’s 
out for mayhem.” 

“Scythes on his chariot wheels, 
h’mm? Remember that lot from 
Orion with the acid jets?” 

“And those sh’e-minks from 
Scorpio way who couldn’t see 
why we wouldn’t let them dump 
spikes on the track behind? 
Sometimes I think Gal Q is us- 
ing us to civilize half the delin- 
quents in the Galaxy.” 

^hristmas chuckled and rang 
off. Their intercoms were 
flashing for the daily staff meet- 
ing. Christmas tuned himself in 
and listened with one ear, while 
going through a batch of rulings 
Dana had brought in for signa- 
ture. Secretary Detweiler was a 
plump little man with gazelle 
eyes, very good at a job Christ- 
mas would have loathed. At the 
moment one of his aides was de- 
scribing plans for celebrating 
the finish of the giant ice-slug 

76 



race. The contestants had cover- 
ed fifty feet in the extraordinary 
time of six months and were 
due to cross the finish’ line to- 
morrow. Interest in their home 
system was at fever pitch. The 
secretariat had arranged tridi 
FTL coverage from underneath 
the transparent track, so that 
viewers could observe the cell- 
by-cell approach of the slug’s 
feet to the line. 

“They don’t really locomote,” 
the aide was saying. “They grow 
in front and slough off behind. 
Fastest moving thing in their 
system, but of course outsiders 
aren’t interested. I’d like per- 
mission to assemble a small, ah 
claque, I believe the word is, 
and perhaps stimulate a little 
betting. It would help their mor- 
ale.” 

Christmas grunted. Detweiler 
announced plans for making a 
ceremonial award that evening 
to the mouse who had shot the 
alien. 

“Quite a little hero, really,” 
the Secretary said. “If that lad 
had got his ship off. Gal Q would 
have had a messy chase, messy 
and expensive. You’ll come to the 
presentation, won’t you, PC?” 

“Don’t I get a wound stripe?” 
Christmas asked. “My ear is full 
of rat-leavings. Who were they, 
Det?” 

“An officially uncontacted sys- 
tem ’way north of Murillo. Actu- 

GALAXY 



ally, they’ve been trading with 
us for some time, through Muril- 
lo. Apparently they got hold of 
some obsolete stuff and made it 
all the way here in that old warp 
boat. Gal Fed has an M^T mis- 
sion landing there right now ” 

The bursar spoke up. “Either 
we or Gal Q are going to have 
reparations to pay on this. Three 
valuable animals hurt and all 
those scent-null tracks to re- 
build.” 

“And we have adjustments on 
tlie spoiled races.” said the Mu- 
tuel chief. “I think Gal Q should 
be asked to disseminate word 
that one doesn’t just drop in on 
Raceworld.” 

“Nor does one race with ma- 
chines,” growled Christmas. There 
was a moment’s silence. 

IV 

Well,” said Detweiler. 

“Now about our main 
business, the Magellans. You’re 
getting them almost immediate- 
ly, you know, PC. I don’t know 
when they’ll come to Mutuel and 
you others, if at all. Frankly, 
the tour is not working out quite 
as well as we had Hoped. They 
went through the Secretariat 
this morning, and among every- 
thing else we tried a really beau- 
tiful viewing of the complete 
range of Galactic life we service 
here, with chemico-genetic an- 

PARIMUTUEL PLANET 



alyses ... You just can’t tell 
how they’re reacting, but I’m 
afraid it was negative. They ask- 
ed to leave Raceworld tonight. 
Ser Nisrair is troubled.” 

“Who isn’t?” asked Commo 
from Pole North. “I’ve seen 
aliens, but these are alien. Two 
of my secretaries are under seda- 
tion. Did you hear that Gal- 
tech hasn’t been able tc unscrew 
half the junk in that spook-boat 
they came in? Your viewing may 
have only whetted their appeti ;e:i 
for dinner, Det — or offend ;d 
their sense of neatness, like find- 
ing out your neighbor’s hou.je is 
full of vermin. The Clouds are 
just too close for comfort.” 
“Well, we just have to do what 
we can,” Detweiler said, deter- 
minedly brisk. “Anything else?” 
“Sorry tc add to the gloom,” 
Christmas spoke up. “This con- 
cerns Mutuel, too. That new 
Ankru team who have been 
wiiming several events are. only 
carrying a one point two G 
handicap, and Lament has an 
idea this isn’t enough by half. 
So do I. Check this out fast, Det, 
will you? I don’t need to go into 
the implications.” 

“I’ll get right on it.” Detweiler 
looked startled. T’ne Mutuel 
chief laid his Hand over his eyes 
and groaned. 

“Can’t you Hold up their races, 
PC? Great Kali — the adjust- 
ments, the compensations — ” 

77 



He leaned offscreen to hiss at an 
aide. 

“Not solid enough,” Christmas 
said. 

Detweiler signed off with a 
sick look in his gazelle eyes. He 
knew what Christmas meant. 

Alone, Christmas rubbed his 
rusty wool and turned to the 
window. The announcer’s chants 
rang out, and a dozen rhino-type 
creatures, their tails like quiver- 
ing flagpoles over their laboring 
rumps, padded behind the start- 
er’s gate. 

Christmas smiled automati- 
cally, but somehow the magic 
had ebbed. He — all of them — 
knew what the magic was. It 
wasn’t the clamor of the stands, 
or the rolling coffers of Mutuel, 
or in the rhinos’ horn-down 
charge across the finish, the silks 
of planets a thousand light-years 
apart flying from their tails. The 
magic invested those things, but 
it was not of them . and it 
was threatened. 

T Tis outer com chimed and 
cleared to show the bony 
black face of the young vet. 

“Sir, the infirmary wouldn’t 
keep her — that, ah, young lady 
from Myria, I mean, and she 
can’t go back to her team; they 
insist that she kill herself or 
they’ll do it for her.” 

“Oh, for Solsake! We’ve got 
our hands full right now. Take 

78 



charge of her for a while, will 
you Doctor? Stick with her — ' 
show her around. I know you’re 
a veterinarian. Refer Lament to 
me . Well, take the sword 
away from her. And get some 
pants on her, will you? She looks 
horrible. Why shouldn’t virgins 
on Myria wear pants? Oh, never 
mind — do anything you can, 
right?” 

“Ser Nisrair and the Magel- 
lans are on their way up, PC,” 
said Dana’s voice. 

He stood to greet them as the 
big folding doors swung wide. 

Looming beside Nisrair were 
two coal-black sinuous shapes as 
tall as he, topped with dead white 
triangular heads like bleached 
horse-skulls. 

Christmas bowed and stood 
watching while Nisrair explain- 
ed the Steward’s functions. The 
Magellans never moved. Their 
horse-skulls turned on him, eye- 
less, expressionless. Christmas, 
like most of the Galaxy, had 
seen them on the vast FTL cov- 
erage that announced First Con- 
tact, but he was not prepared 
for their unnerving alienness in 
the flesh, or whatever they were. 
They seemed to exude a faint 
disquieting odor ... or was it 
a vibration? 

The Magellans’ voder crackled 
suddenly, interrupting Nisrair. 

“You are the (?) juridical (?) 
ethical organ,” it said tonelessly 

GALAXY 



Christmas couldn’t tell w/hich one 
was using it. 

“That’s right,” he said to the 
blank skull-eyes. “It is my job 
to see that the fairest possible 
rules are set for all contestants, 
and to enforce them in detail 
and in spirit. When some condi- 
tion affects contestants unequal- 
ly, we work out new rules by 
unanimous agreement if possible. 
If not, my word is final — sorry 
I didn’t get that.” 

“Query your statement re 
spirit,” repeated the voder. 

“Oh! I meant that we do not 
allow the technical wording of 
a rule to work against the intent 
to deal equally fairly with all. 
We define an equal chance as 
conditions as close as possible to 
those on the contestants’ home 
planets; for example, to compen- 
sate for different gravities we 
have a handicapping device — “ 

“Spirit ...” the voder mut- 
tered unintelligibly. The two 
horse-skulls glared down at him 
unmoving. 

“You have great power here,” 
the voder went on. “You could 
affect many contests without (?) 
detection (?) supervision for 
your own profit. Query you do 
not do so. Query your identity.” 

^hristmas glanced at Ser Nis- 
rair. Hadn’t he briefed them? 
He saw a worry-helix in one of 
the Gal Q officer’s tendrils. 

PARIMUTUEL PLANET 



“Why, like everyone here — 
everyone in authority — I’m a 
Solterran,” Christmas said stiff- 
ly. “I assume you were informed 
that Solterrans originated and 
run Raceworld.” 

“Peculation (?) speculation 
(?) ...” the voder gobbled. Evi- 
dently the alien semantics were 
giving Central Computer a hard 
time. Then it said clearly, “Query 
there is no corruption.” 

Christmas said nothing. 
“Corruption, in a system of 
this sort, can be defined simply 
as entropy,” Ser Nisrair intoned 
smoothly. “And of course, en- 
tropy, or degradation of order, is 
avoided by all civilized beings, 
since no local increase in com- 
plexity can offset entropic ef- 
fects in the larger matrix. We 
see three main entropic poten- 
tials in the Raceworld system. 
First, external parasitism — at- 
tempts at a take-over from with- 
out. You have viewed the Galac- 
tic security force which guards 
against this. Second, attempts by 
the contestants to subvert por- 
tions of the system from within, 
for individual or planetary ben- 
efit. The Steward here functions 
to prevent this, with the aid of 
his own security staff and such 
outside help as continuous prob- 
ability monitoring from Mutuel. 
Thirdly, there is the possibiility 
of the distortion of the system by 
its own organizing elements, 

79 



that is, by the Solterrans them- 
selves. This is highly unlikely, as 
I indicated earlier • — perhaps 
too briefly — first because of the 
fact that we meet all their mate- 
rial desires, secondly because of 
the high value placed upon hon- 
esty and fair play in the Solter- 
rans’ own value system, in which 
they are indoctrinated from in- 
fancy as managers of Raceworld, 
and thirdly because the Solter- 
rans themselves insist upon a 
program of periodic testing con- 
ducted by Galactic experts in 
combination with a rotating pan- 
el of neutral planets.” 

A pause in which Christmas 
could hear the voder whispering 
to the Magellans. 



“We will observe,” the voder 
said. “Alone.” 

Nisrair’s antennae, which had 
straightened out during his 
speech, kinked again. “You wish 
me to leave?” he asked. 

“You mean, stay here and 
watch our normal operations?” 
asked Christmas. 

“Yes.” 

“Well, certainly. Glad to have 
you. Make yourselves comfort- 
able. Would you like, ah, chairs? 
Resting surfaces?” Christmas 
suggested through clenched teeth. 

The Magellans rippled into 
sudden violent motion and then 
stopped abruptly. They were 
now standing behind Christmas’s 
off shoulder. 




80 



GALAXY 



“Proceed,” said the voder. 

“Right,” grated Christmas. He 
rang for Dana and bowed to Ser 
Nisrair, who allowed himself 
to be ushered out, antennae rigid. 

1 4 A 11 right, Dana, I’m open for 
business. Our guests are 
staying to observe. What’s come 
in?” 

“A complaint has been filed by 
Betelgeuse system.” Only a slight 
starchiness about the whispers be- 
trayed Dana’s awarenss of the ap- 
paraitions looming behind Christ- 
mas. “They have a team of giant 
bore-worms, and they claim their 
entry was fouled by striking 
tunnels left by a previous race.” 

“Those cursed worms have 



gnawed up that whole mountain 
range,” Christmas growled. “Al- 
low the claim, notify Mutuel, 
and tell the Secretariat we need 
some new mountains. They’re 
going to devastate the planet. 
Better yet, ask Detweiler if Gal- 
Q could move in an asteroid for 
all those excavation contests. 
There’s mining over in the next 
system; maybe they can shove us 
a rock or two. Det should have 
thought of that.” 

To the presences behind he 
added. “This is a just claim 
against Raceworld for improper 
track conditions and must be al- 
lowed. Those who bet on the af- 
fected team will be compensat- 
ed.”

“We understand your lan- 
guage,” the voder said hollow- 

Kurtis came on the intercom. 
As the screen lit, Christmas re- 
alized that the aliens had chosen 
to stand where no viewer would 
pick them up. 

“Your Flangians, PC. Its Pyr- 
rhoxa all over again. Their driv- 
ers are nothing more than mon- 
keys, the horses were training 
them. We caught the horses cold, 
laying out a ploy for the next 
race. They didn’t fancy their 

own odds, so they were lixing to 
have a long shot from Fitfat win. 
They actually passed their bet- 
ting instructions to one of my 
boys. Usually they do it through 
their food-handler, but he got 

delayed by a girl — you know 
Elva.” 

“Mutuel will go up the wall on 
this one, Kurt; they’ve been in 
a lot of races.” For the Magel- 
lans’ benefit he added, “Of 

course they will have to reim- 
burse all bettors, probably with 
damages. Thank our stars, those 
light equines aren’t too popular. 
Give Detweiler the word, will 

you?” 

“It’s lucky they went for tKe 
big odds so openly,” Kurtis said. 
“If they hadn’t been so greedy 
they might have had a longer 
run. Well, that’s horses for you.” 

Christmas flinched and cut him 
off. 

82 



Dana looked up from his own 
commocollar. 

“Ankru has just won another 
one, PC.” 

Holding his fingers on Detwei- 
ler’s channel, Christmas swung 
around to the Magellans. “I am 
now going to query the Secretary 
on a very serious case,” he told 
them. “A team from a planet 
called Ankru appears to have 
been assigned too light a gravity 
handicap, probably due to an er- 
ror in the original schedules 
made up the Secretary’s office. 
The team has of course been 
winning in several different class 
events.” He swung back. 

“Anything on Ankru yet, 
Det?” 

The gravity is absolutely cor- 
rect at one point two G, PC,” 
Detweiler told his gravely. “Ac- 
cording to both our own star 
synopsis and the Gal Q master 
directory.” 

“Can’t be — they’re still win- 
ning. Four out of live now. Be- 
sides — have you seen the 
brutes?” 

T^ttweiler nodded perplexedly. 

Suddenly both he and 
Christmas started to speak at 
once, the Secretary’s tenor riding 
over Christmas’s rumble. 

“Ambimass!” he exclaimed. 
“That could be it — I’ll signal 
Center for the full planetary 
specs!” 



GALAXY 



“But — ” said Christmas to 
the empty screen. The office 
door lit up. 

“Visitors with an appointment, 
PC,” Dana told him. “He’s from 
somewhere I can’t pronounce in 
Sector 90. Insists on talking to 
you in person, something about 
their age-weight handicap.” 

The caller ambled in, an im- 
mense hump of shell with a sad, 
tapir-like face emerging at knee- 
height. He began hooting in near- 
ly incomprehensible Galactic, 
with much ritual courtesy. 
Christmas waved Dana over to 
interpret. 

“The problem is that their en- 
try is now fifteen hundred Stan- 
dard years old, and the age 
handicap’s gone asymptotic.” 
“How long do your animals 
live?” Christmas asked. 

“He’s not sure,” Dana trans- 
lated. “This particular animal 
has been winning races for over 
a millenium — he races every 
twenty years — and the horn ; 
system expects him to go on in- 
definitely, I gather. They don’t 
have any more, right now, breed- 
ing is slow. With no weight hand- 
icap differential any more, it’s 
getting tough. They’re up against 
a much younger similar form 
from a new system, and plane- 
tary prestige is at stake.” 

“He seems a nice old boy. But 
we can’t bugger up the whole 
system. Even anti-grav wouldn’t 

PARIMUTUEL PLANET 



help him : the animal would lose 
traction. Ask him if he would be 
satisfied to switch over to non- 
competitive exhibition, with 
choice of pace-setters, and lots 
of fanfare — oldest living cham- 
pion, and all that!” 

Dana and the alien Hooted at 
length. Behind Christmas the 
aliens stood moveless, expression- 
less, exuding their faint aroma of 
disquiet. 

“I think he says yes,” Dana re- 
ported. “I told him the Secretary 
will — ” 

V 

'^he office door burst open and 
-*■ a long white figure leaped 
in, drew itself up to eight feet of 
naked girl, rounded the desk 
and fell prone with a crash at 
Christmas’s feet. Christmas curl- 
ed up his toes as he felt cold 
steel sliding under them. Tapir- 
face hooted in alarm and backed 
into the Magellans, who did not 
move. He moaned louder and 
backed off into Dana. The of- 
fice door was jammed with sec- 
retaries, topped by the interne’s 
dark face. 

“What the — you. Doctor 
Ooloo — this is no place — ” 
Christmas roared. 

“She got away from me. Sir, 
through the ladies’ latrine. She 
kept sa5dng she was your slave 
since you saved her life and she 

83 



had to swear fealty or some- 
thing.” 

The girl nodded and patted his 
instep. 

“She says now she must toil 
for you — she has no home.” 
“But what can she do? Has 
she ever seen a computer?” 

“She says she is a warrior.” 
“Yes, I know . Hold it a 
minute, Det!” he said as the in- 
tercom flashed. “All right, young 
lady, you’ve sworn fealty. Now 
you go along with Dr. Ooloo and 
they’ll find you something to do. 
Find something! Anything! Show 
her how to run the elevator ! Now 
get her out of here!” 

He turned to bow deeply to 
the shaken tapir-faced one as 
Dana got them out. From the 
screen, Detweiler’s face watched 
in puzzlement until Christmas 
gave him the all-clear. 

“We were right, PC !” Detweiler 
burst out. “Ankru’s wildly oblate 
spheroid; they’ve got nearly 
three G at the equator. That one- 
point-two figure was an average. 
Obviously they’ve been sending 
animals from their heavy zone.” 
“But in that case, shouldn’t 
the specs have the letter ‘v’ af- 
ter it for variable?” 

“Yes, it should, but it doesn’t. 
Here, look at the Directory read- 
out. Same in our synopsis, of 
course.” 

“Recent date on that para- 
graph,” Christmas said thought- 

84 



fully. “Just about the time Ank- 
ru applied, wasn’t it?” 

“H’mm yes, it’s a change no- 
tice. They come out periodi- 
cally from Gal Comp by FTL 
and are automatically transcrib- 
ed here . Wait, let me see if 
we still have the old paragraph.” 
He dived off-screen, to return 
noticeably pale. “The old direc- 
tory paragraph Has been destroy- 
ed, but I found it in my person- 
al synopsis. The V was there, 
before the change. What could 
have happened?” 

1 1 ^ eems to me there’s three 
possibilities,” said Christ- 
mas. “Gal Comp mistransmitted, 
the FTL garbled, or something 
went v/rong with the transcriber 
in your office.” 

“Gal Comp has never sent a 
mis-read, Peter.” Detweiler sel- 
dom used his given name. “You 
know the Directory is the Gal- 
axy bible for navigation, admin- 
istration, everything; they have 
a fantastic technical control on 
it. The Directory literally never 
has had an error . The trans- 
mission could garble, of course, 
but they do a triplication with 
discrepancy signal. For one let- 
ter alone to fall out and the 
warning to fail too would be, 
well, just about the fifty mil- 
lion monkej^. And the tran- 
scriber in our office is automatic 
too. It would be almost impossi- 

GALAXY 



ble for it to miss one symbol in 
an otherwise correct paragraph.” 

“Unless somebody tampered 
with it,” Christmas finished for 
him in a dead voice. 

“Yes ... It could be done! the 
original read-out is duplicated for 
the Directory and the synopses. 
If the process were stopped, a 
technician could alter the orig- 
inal . There is a gap in the 
time too, Peter, I think.” The 
gazelle eyes were sick, and his 
face showed lines Christmas had 
never seen. 

“The technicians are all our 
people,” said Christmas. 

“Yes, every one. Peter, I’m 
going to signal Gal Comp to 
check their master program. It’ll 
take some while.” He cut off 
abruptly. 

Christmas sat drumming his 
desk. Then he shook himself. 

“Dana, put a hold order on all 
Ankru races. Either they with- 
draw or the races are postponed. 
Handicap error. And tell Kurt to 
see they don’t get off the planet 
and monitor any signals, but not 
to alarm them. And notify Mu- 
tuel that results on those already 
run are now officially invalid.” 

The voder crackled. Christmas 
started. 

“Query correct understanding. 
You now (?) hypothesize (?) 
imaginatively postulate a Sol- 
terran has engaged in deception 
for profit.” 

PARIMUTUEL PLANET 



“That’s right,” Christmas said. 
He took a deep breath. “Only a 
Solterran could have cut out the 
‘v’ that told the planet was ir- 
regular. Once it was out, the way 
was open for Ankru to bring in 
their heavies and make a kill- 
ing. The fact that they entered 
so many items so fast suggests 
that there was a plan. Ankru 
may have cooked it up them- 
selves and subverted our staff 
member, but this is unlikely be- 
cause only one of our people 
would perceive the possibility. 
Of course there is a microscopic 
possibility that there was some 
outside leader, maybe even from 
Gal Center, and that our person 
was intimidated. No ... It looks 
— but it can’t be! It cannot be! 

“Query impossibility. Solter- 
rans do not differ from other 
life.” 

hristmas was silent. 

“Such (?) plans (?) systems 
have been known to fail in our 
Galaxy. The possibility of ma- 
terial gain is very great,” the 
voder probed on. 

“What’s to gain?” Christmas 
burst out, aware that he was be- 
ing driven closer to what he 
would not say. “We have every- 
thing one could wish, homes, 
luxury, travel — all free.” 
“Possibility of material gain 
for your home planet is very 
great.” 

85 




“This is our home planet,” 
Christmas responded mechanical- 
ly. What was wrong with' Ser 
Nisrair? How could he have 
failed to brief the Magellans? It 
was unforgivable . Christmas 
felt the never-quite-absent ache 
rising. 

“Query correct understanding,” 
the voder said, like a vulture 
picking at his vitals. “You are 
native of planet Terra in system 
Sol.” 

He was going to have to say it. 
He surged up and strode to the 
window, his back to the aliens. 

“There is no living planet of 
Terra. The Solterrans you have 
seen here are descendants of 
small colonies on our moon and 
a few other places at the time 
Terra was destroyed. Terra was 
the only habitable planet in our 
system.” 

The ache was hard in his 
breast now. As a child he had 
sung There is a dome That we 
call home. Green T err a is no 
more. Neither he nor his fifteenth 
grandfather had known Green 
Terra, and no Terran he knew 
lived in a dome, but he had the 
images of grim survivors in as- 
teroid bubbles, under leaky 
Marsdome . watching the big 
ships of Gal Q come poking in 
to see what was burning up their 
scintillographs, and to rescue the 
orphans. 

“In our system those without 
86 



home planet do not long persist.” 

“Nor here,” said Christmas. It 
was true. Orphan races somehow 
died out, no one knew quite why 
— or why the ache never died. 
Either you kept hold of the ache 
and lived or you forgot and after 
a while you weren’t around any 
more. 

“Raceworld is run by the plan- 
etless, you see,” he said aloud. 
“There is no one outside to prof- 
it. Only Solterrans.” 

“Your assistant is not Sol- 
terran.” 

“Oh, we take in a few other 
orphans. Dana’s people got one 
ship out of a planet-busting war. 
Doesn’t often happen.” 

Were Dana’s people going to 
live with the ache, too? Christ- 
mas wondered. He had never 
pried behind the cheery brown 
eyes. Dana was fifth generation. 
There were still some cubs 
around . 

“Query your planet was lost 
by war.” The ghoul-voice bored 
on relentlessly. Christmas studied 
the horizon. The scene below 
him, the announcer’s call — all 
phantasms now. 

“No. We blew it up ourselves.” 

The voder gargled. “Such cases 
especially non-persistent,” it 
said. 

This too was true. Those races 
who had destroyed their own 
worlds never lived on long. Ex- 
cept one, Christmas thought 

GALAXY 



grimly. All Honor to the suicides, 
the fratricides, the matricides — 
the lost Solterrans who had 
found their immortality as pur- 
veyors of a primitive pleasure to 
the Galaxy. 

'"T^he voder- vulture was squawk- 
ing again. 

“Query you place value on (?) 
ethics (?) group conduct of dead 
planet.” 

Clu-istmas whirled around. 

“Terra is not dead!” he shout- 
ed into the white skull-faces. 
“Every civilized race in the Gal- 
axy knows Terra! The word 
Solterran is slang for fairness, for 
incorruptibility, all over the Gal- 
axy! Ask anywhere — ask in the 
Center, go to the Rim and ask 
things that hang by their tails 
— they know us. They joke about 
it — they don’t understand it — 
but they play our game and they 
use our name as a symbol! How 
can Terra be dead when mother 
fish in the seas teach their young 
to be like us?” 

He paused, breathing hard. 

“There was nothing like Race- 
world before we came,” he went 
on. “We — the Terran surviv- 
ors — thought of it, planned it, 
sold it to Gal Center. We’re 
a good piece of their budget 
now. But with us it is for Terra. 
How could Terra be dead when 
birds that fly in freezing ammonia 
talk about her?” 



He ran down and the room was 
silent. 

The voder curdled faintly and 
hushed again. Christmas went 
back to his desk. The black dv- 
ils had got it out of him. 

“Query,” announced the vo- 
der. Somehow Christmas had the 
impression a different Magel- 
lan was speaking, but he couldn’t 
care less. 

“You experience noxious sub- 
jective disturbance.” 

“I experience noxious subjec- 
tive disturbance, yes,” Christ- 
mas said bleakly. “If . if . 
one of us . The whole thing is no 
good . the unique thing . 
But it can’t be ” 

The minutes dragged by. The 
aliens spoke no more. Dana came 
in with some papers, not meeting 
Christmas’s eyes he always mon- 
itored the office. A planetary rep 
came on the outercom, breezily 
intent on getting a special rul- 
ing in the hopper classes. The rep 
looked like a kangaroo. Christ- 
mas answered him mechanically. 
In the middle of a complicated 
point about tail rests, Detweiler’s 
signal chimed. Christmas spun 
away from the kangaroo. 

“ — Definitely, Peter. I’ve 
seen the master read-in.” 
“What’s definite!” 

“The V was never transmitted 
from Cal Comp! Some molecule, 
I don’t know — anyway, it’s the 
first mis-read in five Standard 



PARIMUTUEL PLANET 



87 



centuries; they’re wild. It’s 
theirs, Peter! It’s theirs.” 

“It’s not us,” Christmas said 
softly. They broke connection. 

VI 

^hristmas sat stone-still. Then 
he slapped his desk hard and 
whirled on the Magellans. 

“You see?” he shouted. “You 
see. Oh, 1 should have seen it had 
to be them; a mechanical pro- 
cess can reverse a unit at ran- 
dom, but motivation acts like a 
field — elements don’t change 
until the field does — ” 

The kangaroo was spluttering 
from the screen. Christmas got 
him mollified. Over his shoulder 
he heard the Magellans rustling 
and turned back in time to catch 
a glimpse of crimson rib-flaps 
opening and closing along the 
black sides. The voder made an 
incomprehensible noise. Christ- 
mas stared back, alien, gro- 
tesque. Christmas remembered 
that there were Galaxies, and 
war. 

A grating sound came from 
outside the big doors. Dana 
rushed to fling it open, reveal- 
ing Ser Nisrair standing eyeball 
to eyeball with the Myrian girl. 
The point of her sword was at 
Nisrair’s stomach plates. A sec- 
retarial hubbub arose from be- 
yond. 

“Let him in,” Christmas or- 
88 



dered. “And put that knife away. 
Who in Entropy told you I need- 
ed a door-guard? Excuse me, 
Ser, we’ve been h.aving prob- 
lems ” 

Nisiair stumped in, antennae 
formal. Three of his cyestalks 
were trained on the Magellans, 
one on Christmas. The aliens 
gave no sign. 

“The transportation back to 
Galactic Center which you re- 
quested is now ready,” Ser Nis- 
rair told them. 

“No,” said the voder. 

“But — ” said Nisrair. “Well, 
then, you wish to continue the 
tour here? We have an interest- 
ing demonstration of probability 
extrapolation prepared for the 
evening.” 

"No,” repeated the voder. 

Again there came the crimson 
rustling. 

“ . Not previously visible,” 
said the voder, and relapsed into 
unintelligibility. Nisrair swivel- 
ed a second eye-stalk around to 
Christmas. Christmas opened 
his hands in a shrug. 

‘My companion (?) co-travel- 
er is .. untranslatable . dis- 
tvubance. We wish to retire now 
to consider . garble . what 
we have seen.” 

“I will escort you at once to 
the hotel,” said Nisrair. Still the 
aliens did not move. 

The voder crackled on for a 
moment and then said clearly, 

GALAXY 



“TecHnology, communications, 
mathematics, economics, chem- 
istry ...” It went into garble, 
and quit. The aliens were sud- 
denly in swirling motion to the 
door. 

There they stopped, wheeled, 
and stamped hard in unison with 
black whip-like toes, making a 
report like a pistol-shot. The next 
second they were receding 
through the outer office. 

Nisrair went after them in 
massive pursuit, one roimd eye- 
ball still twisted over his shoul- 
der at Christmas. 

"TAana silently closed the big 
doors and leaned with his 
back to them. 

“Who knows,” said Christmas. 
Tragedians, maybe. Romantics. 
Were they crying? Or laughing? 
It was something they wanted. 
Gal Q has been killing them with 
computers, you know, and every- 
thing so sublime ...” 

“The gods do not come to 
earth to see lightning,” Dana 
said. “An old saying of my peo- 
ple.” 

“Maybe they weren’t gods,” 
Christmas said. “Maybe they 
were a couple of old aunties out 
for a joyride ... or a retired 
couple who got lost.” 

He shook off his ghosts. 

“All right, let’s get that unholy 
Myrian in here — and that Doc- 
tor Oolooloolooloo — ” 



He went to the window, snuff- 
ing luxuriously. The magic was 
back. Dana herded in the gan- 
gling humans. 

“Young lady, stay on your 
feet. I’ve got something to tell 
you. You couldn’t go home be- 
cause you lost the race, right? 
Well, you didn’t lose it, you won 
it. The animal who came in first 
has been disqualified; it was run- 
ning under an inadequate gravity 
handicap. Do you understand? 
Tell her. Doctor, she won it fair 
and square. Now she can go back 
to Myria in triumph and be a sa- 
cred warrior virgin again. Okay?” 
The girl broke into sobs of 
unmistakable woe. 

“For Solsake — what now?” 
“She says she can’t go home 
now. Sir, because — uh — ” 
“Because what?” 

“Sir, you said, do an5rthing — ” 
“Oy not vergan now!” she 
wailed and collapsed on the in- 
terne’s chest. 

“She . she wants to stay 
here,” said the interne. “I 
thought she could work out well 
with the animals — ” 

“She can’t stay here, she’s got 
a home. What’s that?” 

“She says they’ll disembowel 
her at home for not being a vir- 
gin,” the interne said miserably. 

“Really? Permissive types. 
Well, Dana, do you think she 
might qualify as a planetless per- 
son? I’ll buck a request over to 

89 



PARIMUTUEL PLANET 



Det in the morning; he’ll have to 
get cultural certification. All 
right! You, Doctor, take her to 
Lamont’s transient billet; she 
can camp there till we get this 
straightened out. You, young 
lady, go with him and do what- 
ever he says, right? You can put 
some pants on now and put that 
sword away, right? No, stay on 
your feet — in public, anyway. 
And you, both of you — get 
out of here and stay out until I 
call for you — if I ever do — 
right? Scat!” 

'■y^he drifting fragrance of a 
-*■ cheroot told Christmas that 
his night deputy had come into 
the office and was quietly check- 
ing through Dana’s log to see 
what was pending for the night. 
Coburg was a stocky white- 
haired man who had been main 
track chief until his legs failed. 

“Should be a quiet night,” 
Christmas told him. “You might 
call Lamont’s office for quar- 
ters for a special case — you 
heard it. And you’re bound to get 
some noise about the Ankru 
thing. Other than that — I’ll call 
in later.” 

He gazed out to where the 
floodlights were coming on over 
plain and mountains, pylons, 
domes and sea. All were folded 
in the gold and pastel of Race- 
world’s perfect evening, one itl 
the infinite series. 

90 



“Somehow I feel you and I 
could do with a small idyll,” he 
said to Dana. “How about get- 
ting your family to join me at' 
Seaworld? We’ll snatch a prime 
table by the big shark races and 
your kids can have themselves 
a swim-ride . Great, I’ll meet 
you at freshwater pools. I have 
to go over to Admin for a min- 
ute.” 

He went out to his sled and 
floated into the evening. Below 
him a line of giant wolf-spiders 
was parading onto the track, 
prancing daintily on twenty-foot 
legs. The bugle made sweet 
sounds. 

Arcadia, Nisrair had called it, 
Arcadia or Arcady was a pasto- 
ral dream. No, this was another 
dream — one that had kept his 
race alive, of all the orphan 
races. A bright improbable dream 
that their ancestors had manag- 
ed to weave into the Galaxy’s 
life currents so their children 
need never wake up . and 
die. It even hooked those golems 
from the Clouds, Christmas 
chuckled, recalling Ser Nisrair’s 
discomfiture. Maybe the poor 
spooks had been terrified by Gal 
Q’s briefings! 

Grinning, he turned a long 
lazy circle toward Admin. Then 
his grin faded. In his mind was 
the image of Nisrair’s round, re- 
ceding eye. It had been unfor- 
givable to make him bare his 

GALAXY 



soul that way! How could Nis- 
rair have fallen down so badly 
in briefing them? He must have 
been really frantic, Christmas 
decided; he’d never before failed 
to explain the set-up Here to 
visitors in advance. In fact, he’d 
never before failed at much of 
anything. 

The eye came back, brighter, 
expressively clinical. 

“Why, that mealy-mouthed 
big smart cockroach!” Christmas 
exploded aloud. “I should have 
known! He wasn’t just asking 
me to let them press some but- 
tons, or fly over a track. He had 
them figured — and he was 
looking for something to get un- 
der their hides with — and he 
decided to try the Tragedy of 
Terra. Played live. Oh, you soul- 
less big blue bug!” 

He kicked the sled to savage 
speed. 

Then, slowly, his jaw came 
back to normal. 

“It’s his job to get rapport; he 
got rapport.” Christmas mutter- 
ed. He grunted. His lips quirked. 

Grinning once more, the Stew- 
ard of Raceworld braked his sled 
into a gung-ho landing. Below 
him was the amphitheatre where 
the Secretary of Raceworld was 
preparing with all ceremony to 
award a medal to an intrepid 
mouse. Christmas started down 
the ramp while behind him float- 
ed up the cry, “Keeb’y VAAAAAl 

PARIMUTUEL PLANET 



ya!” and the watchers fnm a 
million planets rose and clam- 
ored.

a dead pterodactyl near his house? 



I 

'\Tery mucK like a dead bird, 
» the pteranodon fell out of the 
sky at 4:18 of a Wednesday, fell 
whistling, end-over-end, landing 
squarely in the middle of Sixth 
Avenue and 47th Street. It fell 
flat-out, wings spread, and crush- 
ed a Mustang, two Cadillacs, a 



Buick Riviera, three VW’s, the 
front end of a Peugeot and a 
Grey line Tours sightseeing bus. 

The fall of the beast killed 
eighty-seven people, but it was 
not that, precisely, that caught 
the attention of Will Kiley as he 
emerged from one of the small 
smut bookshops dotting Sixth 
Avenue, his parcel of paperbacks 



93 



and photo sets showing Puerto 
Rican girls with unshaved arm- 
pits and spread thighs clutched 
to his side. Riley’s attention was 
initially caught by the crashing 
shape as it shadowed the street, 
then by the crashing sound as the 
extinct creature impacted, and 
then by his recognition of the 
beast as not merely a pterodactyl, 
but specifically as a pteranodon, 
genus ornithostoma. Kiley, a 
third-year student at Columbia 
University, majoring in Historical 
Geology, instantly recognized the 
osseous crest extending the skull 
to the rear in an effective coun- 
terweight, balancing the mass of 
the huge, bony, toothless, beak. 

Kiley observed this aspect of 
the beast in the dust-settling in- 
stant after the pteranodon, crash- 
ing, bounced, rose into the air 
amid a welter of automobile 
parts and crushed humans, hung 
there as though observing its own 
handiwork and then slammed 
down again very hard on its orig- 
inal ground zero. 

/^ne vast wing lay spread like 
a dusty, olive-gray tarpaulin 
over the still feebly struggling 
bodies of victims trapped beneath 
it. An edge fluttered as pocketed 
air escaped bearing a pungent 
reek of reptilian juices. The other 
extended across 47th Street, sag- 
ging, warty leather stretched on 
tlun bones like collapsed alumi- 
94 



num tubing, the fingered tip 
caressing a tarnished brick front 
adorned by a clustered trio of 
brazen spheres. 

Sirens began keening every- 
where. Screams rose up in the 
intersection as the half-pinned, 
maimed survivors of the beast’s 
tumble struggled to free them- 
selves. From his doorway Kiley 
noted at once that the beast was 
incredibly heavy, much heavier 
by a fantastic overage than any 
pterodactyl had a right to be. 
Aerodynamically a sport, the 
creatures had never weighed more 
than a hundred pounds. Eighty 
was closer to the average. But this 
thing had crushed a sightseeing 
bus and something over a half 
dozen cars. It was many times 
longer and had a far greater 
wingspread than any pterodactyl 
ever exhumed as a fossil. It was 
lying almost like an immense cru- 
cifix, its shaft of body heading 
toward the Radio City Music 
Hall, its wings outspread as 
though waiting for Pilate’s men 
to come and drive in the spikes, 
crosstown on 47th. 

Kiley was torn between staying 
to watch what was certainly go- 
ing to happen, or running back 
uptown to his mingy little room, 
to put the contents of his parcel 
to use. 

At that moment, a group of fif- 
teen Chassidic Rabbinical Semi- 
nary students, adorned with pay- 

GALAXY 



uss, beards and long black over- 
coats. so out-of-line for mid- 
August, and faintly redolent of 
the scent of Rappaport’s gefilte 
fish, emerged from one of the dia- 
mond exchange shops. Seeing the 
dead beast lying in the street, 
they began a loud and incom- 
prehensible argument as to 
whether or not pteranodon was 
kosher. 

“It flies . it’s a chicken,” 
said one- 

“That makes it kosher,” con- 
firmed a second. 

“Snake. It's a reptile,” cour.- 
tered a third. 

“Then most definitely theri 
should be no argument on this 
point, it’s trayil" concluded a 
fourth. 

A florid, large-boned police of- 
ficer of the midtown pre- 
cinct, rar. up from 45tH Street, 
blowing his whistle, readying His 
book of parking tickets and lock 
ing around for the owner of the 
dead beast. Spying an old man 
lounging against the side of a 
papaya juice stand, the cop Hus- 
tled over and pointed an accus- 
ing finger, 

“That your pterodactyli*” 

The old man shook his head. 

“You’re sure.'*” 

The old man began to tremble. 
“Honest to God, it ain’t mine. 
Why’d joo always pick on me?” 

“’Cause you were the guy 
DUNDERBIRD 



owned that big me nkey we 
caught climbin’ up the Empire 
State, that’s why!” 

“They never proved it I” 

“i don’t give a oamn if they 
didn’t- I knew you were the guy. 
I knew that big ape belonged to 
you!” 

“Gh yeah, fuzz. Haw’d ycu 
know?” 

“You were the only guy on the 
street with a seventy-five foot 
tambourine.” 

The lean, cenetted, hatted, 
rouge-on -bones yciu'g woman 
standing au dessns the soct-fleck- 
ed, plate-glass display window of 
the truss and artificial liir.l shop 
on the southwest ccrr.er of the 
blocked intersection compared 
the watch strapped to her narrow 
wrist with the oversized time- 
piece dangling over the sidewalk 
across the street Her lips com- 
pressed int- a hard line like a 
surgery scar For the tenth time 
in thirty seconds she had scan- 
ned the pavement to left and 
right, strode a few im.patient steps 
to peer past the upjuttir.g elbow 
of the pteranodon blocking her 
view. Still no Melville. Melville 
wasn’t coming. Stood up. Her. 
Lilya. Stood up. By a creep like 
Melville, which she was doing 
him the biggest favor of h's life 
just to go out with him, the slob, 
and he’s got the undiluted crust 
to not show, and after she skip- 
ped lunch just to have room for 

93 



a lousy dinner which he probably 
would’ve suggested Nedick’s 
anyway — 

A large, slow-moving middle- 
aged man with moist eyes and a 
mouth like a prime pit was hesi- 
tating, looking at her; Lilya had 
seen a Museum of Modem Art 
Film Retrospective of Films of 
Depravity in 1964; the persistent 
image of Peter Lorre as “M” kept 
oozing into her mind; this was 
probably an out-of-town rapist. 
She’d been staring right at him: 
probably in another second he’ll 
make the pass; I can always spot 
them, yechh; why me? Why 
always me? If I ride in a car with 
someone down the Major Dee- 
§an Expressway, they always 
yell, hey looka that, and I always 
look, and it’s always a legless 
cripple or some drunk lady whose 
thing is collecting cardboard flats 
while it is she’s puking into a 
litter basket, or a cat run over 
across the head by a sanitation 
truck. Why always me? A flasher, 
this one is. I can tell. 

Lilya stiffened her face, let 
her gaze slide past him, turned 
her back, but not rapidly as to 
appear really, like rude. She 
gasped as the old man tottered, 
wheezed, lunged past her, hand 
outstretched for the door of the 
hole-in-comer public house next 
to the prosthetics display. A gush 
of beer-laden air; the door closed 
behind him. Lilya perked as 
96 



though stmck by a wetmop. Her 
eyes fell on the clock. Twelve 
minutes late. She’d give him ex- 
actly two more minutes, or possi- 
bly five, that would make it four- 
thirty on the nose, and besides 
you couldn’t expect her to climb 
over that flying crocodile, which 
somebody ought to call the zoo 
and teU them a few things about 
letting the inmates go falling all 
over the street. 

■^TXill Kiley decided he’d had 

’ ' quite enough morphology 
of flying reptiles for one day. The 
parcel beneath his arm grew 
warm even as he thought of it. 
Within the parcel : Rolling Sin 
House, a novel dealing with six 
young prostitutes who buy a 
house trailer and flout the laws 
of interstate commerce; Lust 
Whip Madam, a stinging tale of 
cmelty and unbridled passions 
among the silken-limbed houris 
of the bondage set in Scarsdale; 
Teeny Slut, an adventure into the 
sexual psychology of the amoral 
young. These three, and a seven- 
teen- picture set of maybe a Ro- 
sita or Consuelo or Guadalupe 
(he would settle for a Dolores), 
were the spurs to his rapidly re- 
turning uptown to a student- 
dingy room. 

He started past the Head of the 
beast, when he. saw the edge of 
the artifact hanging from its 
neck.

It seemed to be a large golden 
disc, hanging from a thick link 
chain. Will Kiley’s instant 
thoughts were not of rich re- 
wards from the archeological so- 
ciety. They were of ready cash for 
old gold in any one of the Second 
Avenue antique shops. Ready 
cash that could buy important 
things like regular meals, more 
books, possibly even a young 
woman’s affections. (Will Kiley, 
having emerged from a cocoon 
of poverty spun about him by his 
parents in Three Bridges, New 
Jersey, was inclined, to accept the 
philosophy that money may not 
be the only thing in life, but the 
other thing won’t go out with you 
if you don’t have it.) 

He jammed the package into 
his jacket pocket and began 
hauling at the golden chain, in 
an attempt — hearty but hardly 
surreptitious — to get the disk 
off the dead pteranodon.

T?rom a doorway across Sixth 
Avenue, a group of youths 
belonging to a Bronx-based or- 
ganization titled The Pelham 
Privateers — what in days of 
pre-protest picketing would have 
been called a juvenile delinquent 
gang, now referred to as “a mi- 
nority youth group” — observed 
Will Kiley’s struggles and con- 
tinued their own observations.

“But it don’t look like it ^ot 
hubcaps,” Angie said. 

“Hey, shtoomie, if it is Isnn’ 
inna street, it is gotta have hub- 
caps. The question’s where?” The 
gang’s leader, George (“The 
Pot”) Lukovitch dealt with mat- 
ters in a realistic fashion. 

“Maybe they’re uimerneaf” 
suggested Vimmy. 

“Could be,” George mused, 
“could very well be.” 

He pondered a moment longer, 
then made up his mind and the 
gang’s collective mind. “We got- 
ta jack it up. Get unnemeat’. Get 
the hubcaps off. Vimmy, I want 
you should take t’ree boys and 
go over to the building they’re 
building onna corner Madison 
an’ 48th. Steal a pneumatic hoist 
or somethin’.” 

Vimmy gave a quick one-fin- 
ger salute and dodged out of the 
doorway, tapping three of the 
gang members on their chests as 
he passed them. 

A hook-and-ladder approach- 
ing from the direction of Fifth 
Avenue swerved to avoid the 
quartet and skidded to a halt in 
the lee of the dead ornithosaurian. 
Big Louis Morono, wearing a 
Texaco hat and black rubber 
boots and slicker, leaped down, 
dragging a foot-long brass noz- 
zle trailing a flat gray boa-con- 
strictor of hose. Assessing the sit- 
uation at a glance, he set off at a 
heavy-footed trot toward the 

97 



stern of the beast, assisted by fel- 
low fire fighters each supporting 
his half dozen yards of tubing. 
A second team lavmched itself 
with silent efficiency in the oppo- 
site direction, toward the giant 
maloccluded jaws. They round- 
ed the head, continued parallel 
with’ the scaly neck, paused only 
momentarily before trampling 
ahead across the leather carpet 
of the wing. They met Big Louis 
and his crew at a point abaft 
the fourth thoracic vertebra. 
“Anything?” 

“Nothing.” 

“Smoke?” 

“Not a wisp.” 

Big Louis sighed. His hose 
drooped. “It figures.” 

“Yeah.” 

“Okay, boys, reel it in.” Mut- 
tering, Big Louis headed back for 
the trembling red truck. Before 
he had taken more than three 
steps, however, one of the mem- 
bers of the second team yelled, 
“Hey, Cap! It’s a, uh you know 
what, a dragon. Maybe it breathes 
fire. Could be, y’know!” 

Big Louis stopped dead and 
smiled a winsome smile. ““Reel 
it out again, men!” he shouted. 

\ s Will Kiley struggled man- 
fully with the golden chain 
and its golden disk, two rumpled 
figures wearing thick glasses paus- 
ed beside him, but pointed fre- 
quently at the dead beast’s head: 
98 



“The chief difference in the 
pterodactyl skull from that of a 
bird is in the way in which the 
malar arch is prolonged back- 
ward on each side,” said the first. 

“The nostrils are unusually 
large. Could it be Dimorphodon?” 
asked the second. 

“Don’t be a silly goose, Tren- 
cHard,” replied the first. “Doesn’t 
even resemble.” 

Trenchard’s eyes flashed anger 
and his mouth tightened. 
“Damn’s blood, Goilvey! You 
were the one who said this genus 
shouldn’t be this heavy. You were 
the one who dragged me out of 
the Automat, leaving a perfectly 
good fish cake, just to come 
down here and argue about this. 
I don’t know why it’s so big, and 
I don’t know why it’s so heavy 
... all I know is that I don’t 
like you talking to me so snotti- 
ly. Your seniority in the depart- 
ment doesn’t give you that right!” 

A civil rights group, attracted 
by the noise, abandoned their la- 
bors integrating a parking lot 
and, instantly interpreting, what 
was going on there in the inter- 
section, whipped out magic mark- 
ers and fresh cardboard and re- 
jingoed their slogans. They be- 
gan parading around and around 
the dead beast, bearing signs that 
read HE DIED FOR US! and 
DON’T LET THIS DEATH GO 
UNAVENGED! and SOCIETY 
ASKS: WHY?

“Looks dead to me,” murmur- 
ed a secretary, walking to Sak’s 
with a girl friend. 

“Remind me to make an ap- 
pointment with an orthodontist,” 
her friend replied. 

A representative of the sani- 
tation workers union — summon- 
ed by enraged members of his lo- 
cal — arrived on the scene and 
uttered a snarl. “Like hell we 
will!” he commented to the mem- 
bers of the press. “It’ll lay there 
till hell freezes over! If the cor- 
rupt and Commie-S 5 unp govern- 
ment of this city thinks it is go- 
ing to fatten and batten on the

it has another think coming. The 
name is Fortnoy. F-O-R-T ...” 
The two CIA men ran out of 
film. 

One’s tie-tack camera click- 
ed on empty spools, and the oth- 
er’s mini-corder in his hatband 
whirred emptily. They met at 
mid-pteranodon and compared 
notes: 

“Maoist?” 

“Doubtful. Castro?” 

“Maybe. Been able to reach the 
office yet?” 

“No, something’s wonking up 
the circuits.” 

“Jamming?” 

“Maybe. Maoist?” 

“Doubtful. Russkie?”” 

“Maybe. ...”

T^iley pulled and strained at 
the disk, trying to drag it 
out from imder the great head. 
He was making some small head- 
way when a photographer and 
three models and the director of 
fashion for a leading woman’s 
magazine nudged him aside and 
began posing the girls on the 
head of the dead beast. 

“Look anguished, Maddie,” 
said the photographer, a slim and 
ascetic man wearing an Australi- 
an digger Hat in white velour. 
The model looked anguished. 
“No, no! More anguished. Cry 
for the entire world, sweetheart!” 
Maddie anguished harder. She 
cried. “Now tilt the pelvis just 
a tiddle forward, darling,” the 
photographer urged. “Let’s trans- 
mute that anguish into a starchy 
impudence at the really tasty 
things the season’s culottes have 
to say to the Now Female!” 

“Off duty,” said a cabbie, 
streaking down around a wingtip 
and plunging up the Avenue. 

Somewhere children were 
laughing and the wind was sweet 
with the scent of imminent sum- 
mer. But that was somewhere 
else. 

“Jesus, I can’t stand the stink!” 
shouted a woman from the sev- 
enth floor window of an employ- 
ment agency. 

Seventeen sailors from a Jap- 
anese freighter in New York on 
three-day leave crouched near 

99 



the juncture of wing and torso, 
and snapped pictures of the dead 
beast with Leicas, several mur- 
muring words that sounded like, 
“Rodan.” No one paid them any 
heed. 

Several handbills were Hastily 
pasted onto the leathery hide, an- 
nouncing the candidacy of Roger 
Scarpennetti for Borough Presi- 
dent. 

A vendor of socks (seconds) 
pitched his way from tail to beak, 
and made almost four dollars 
with his wares. 

Three agile and rolling-gaited 
Caughnawaga Indians, those no- 
ble descendants of the noblest of 
noble savages, crossed 48th Street 
heading downtown. They carried 
lunch pails. They were on their 
way home by IRT subway 
(which they could catch at 42nd 
85 Times Square) from the build- 
ing site construction on Madison 
and 48th, the selfsame construc- 
tion site toward which four Pel- 
ham Privateers (behind the point 
scouting of the redoubtable Vim- 
my) at this moment were streak- 
ing. The three redskins, high- 
steel workers of the most loftily- 
paid species, paused at the cor- 
ner of 47th and Sixth, shifted 
lunch pails and clucked their 
tongues almost in unison. 

“Is that crummy, I ask you!” 
said Walter Knife-That-Gleams- 
In-Starlight. 

“Yeah, first they zap alia the 
100 



buffalo, bison, whatever the hell 
they was that they did in, and 
now this!” The lament was voiced 
by Teddy Bearclaw. 

“Goddamn white-eyes,” added 
Sidney G. Nine Fires. 

“Red man’s burden,” said Wal- 
ter. 

“Is it not a sad pass what our 
people has come to, that we must 
erect for these crummy pony sol- 
diers a edifice of such nobility 
as we are at this precise moment 
in time erecting,” penultimated 
Teddy. 

“What the hell is a bison?” 
asked Sidney G. Nine Fires. Mu- 
tual shrugs of confusion led to 
a prompt exit.

'"T^he Reverend Leroy L. Beal, 
arriving at the head of the 
Poke County, Mississippi delega- 
tion to the First Annual Congress 
of the International Evangelical 
Brotherhood for the Promotion of 
Christian Love and Low Down- 
Payments, paused, waving his 
flock to a halt, shaking his head 
sadly at the vast obstruction 
blocking the intersection ahead. 
His second-in-command moved 
up beside liim. Together they 
studied the crumpled, strutted, 
awning-winged apparition. 

“Well, Leroy, what do you 
make of it?” the lieutenant in- 
quired. 



GALAXY 



Rev. Beal sighed. “The expen- 
diture of funds and ingenuity 
that went into constructing this 
hoax and placing it in our line 
of march could have supported 
three indigent families in fair 
comfort for a period of at least 
two months,” he stated. 

The two men advanced; Rev. 
Beal poked at the leathery hide 
with a finger. 

“Plastic,” he said. “A trans- 
parent fraud.” 

“As I see it, Leroy, they in- 
tended to suspend the thing from 
wires and have it buzz us. But 
apparently the wires broke.” 

“Obviously. Tsk. Sometimes I 
wonder at the curious picture the 
opposition seems to entertain of 
our gullibility. First the whole 
thing with the sheets over their 
heads. Now this: rubber pterano- 
saurs.” 

“So — what do we do?” 

“We make ourselves comfort- 
able,” the Reverend said. “And 
wait.” 

As the strains of We Shall 
Overcome rose on the afternoon 
air, a party of lobbyists for the 
All American Society for the 
Preservation of Property Values 
(ASPPV) emerged from the 
gloom of Reilly’s Bar and Grille, 
summoned by the mingled cries 
of the wounded, the chatter of 
the spectators, and the exhorta- 
tions of the cop, still in search of 
a recipient for the summons. The 
DUNDERBIRD 



group blinked at the scene, not- 
ing the size and placement of 
the reptile with eyes accustomed 
to lightning assessment. 

“By George, Charlie,” the Head 
lobbyist said, around a cigar, 
“you couldn’t replace that thing 
for under twenty-eight-five or 
I’m a baboon’s nephew.” 

Charlie was staring at the sing- 
ers grouped by the monster’s 
stem. 

“Tell me there’s no Commie 
money behind them Nigras,” he 
murmured. 

Lilya looked at her watch for 
the thirty-first time. Ten more 
minutes and not a second more, 
and then by God she’d take a 
cab to Schrafft’s and order the 
expensivist item on the menu and 
if that skin-disease Melville ever 
dared to show that collection of 
acne scars he called a face again — 

tiOorry, lady,” the man with 
^ the leather jacket said, not 
looking at Lilya as he bellied 
her aside. He planted his feet and 
looked the project over, from 
beak to tail-tip and back to beak. 

“Hey, Jake,” a wiry man in 
overalls said. “You want I should 
get the rig in position?” 

“Nix,” Jake said succinctly. 
“Right,” the wiry man said. 
“This is outta our line — ” 
Jake whirled and grabbed a 
handful of the wiry man’s overall 
bib.

“There ain’t no wrecking joK 
Ajax Wrecking can’t handle and 
dontcha forget it,” He growled. 
“Hold the headacKe ball. Tell 
the boys to break out the chain 
saws.” 

“Sure, Jake. Only you got 
aholt of the hair on my cKest — ” 

“Twenny minutes, that’s wh'at 
the dude said. 1 don’t want to 
see nothing but hip pockets and 
elbows until we got this inter- 
section clear, get me?” 

A husband and '^vife team, tour- 
ists from Joplin, Missouri, mak- 
ing one of their rare p.a.’s in the 
apple, stood near the forearm 
and mete carpus of the dead beast, 
the husband setting the automatic 
timer on his camera. Then he 
strolled nonchalantly to his 
spouse (indicating his ease and 
familiarity with matters photo- 
graphic), struck an attitude, and 
waited, smiling, till the camera 
had clicked them off. "Do we 
have time to make it down to the 
Village for some shots with hip- 
pies, before dinner?” the wife 
asked. Her husband’s answer was 
lost on the wind as the mayor’s 
helicopter settled in the center of 
Sixth Avenue, just above 47th 
Street. 

The riot police jog-trotted 
around the corner of 48th and 
Sixth and began breaking up into 
assault teams. 

“Careful of that Mace!” Cap- 
tain Schirmer bellowed through 
102 



the bullhorn. Snipers in office 
windows began firing at street- 
lights. "All right, move it out!” 
shouted Captain Schirmer. The 
first wave of riot police lobbed 
their tear gas grenades, and be- 
gan spraying high pressure Hoses 
down the Avenue. The rabbinical 
students fled, still uncertain 
whether the pteranodon was 
kosher or trayt — but dead cer- 
tain the eggs were edible if the 
proper bruchah was said over 
them. 

The rescue squads at last pulled 
the last of the survivors out from 
under the dead beast and carried 
them away from the line of com- 
bat. 

Kiley was trapped at the neck 
of the creature, still trying to 
yank loose the golden amulet. 
He was cut off from escape by 
the insurrecting Columbia Law 
students and Black Panther 
Freedom Party members on the 
eastern flank, by the riot police 
using Mace and leadweighted 
truncheons on the west, by the 
joughneck warriors of the Ajax 
Wrecking Corporation (all cx- 
Seabees) on the North, and by 
the advancing wave of members 
of the Amalgamated Butchers 
and Meat Hackers Local #39 on 
the South. 

He crouched down all the way, 
hoping to go unseen, and con- 
tinued yanking at the circle of 
gold.

TV /T ore police on horseback clog- 
ged the scene, trying to aid 
their beat partner in establishing 
to whom the corpse in the street 
belonged. The ticket was wit- 
ten, it merely needed to be served. 

Three hookers began working 
the uptown side of 47 th Street, 
hoping some of the show biz 
crowd would stick to their fin- 
gers, or other portions of their an- 
atomy. 

“Oh!” cried Alice, awakening, 
“apparently it is all a dream!” 

“You’re under arrest,” said the 
cop with the ticket, to no one in 
particular. He said it again, soft- 
er, but no one paid any attention. 

Lilya curse/wished plagues of 
gnats and nits on the acne-pock- 
ed head of Melville and stalked 
off down the Avenue, passing the 
hip-girdle of the pteranodon, fail- 
ing to look down where she would 
have seen her much cursed Mel- 
ville, much more crushed than 
cursed. 

Near the hind limbs of the dead 
beast twelve members of The 
Pelham Privateers now worked 
diligently trying to get the beast 
erect so its hubcaps could be 
stolen. The pneumatic jacks they 
had installed merely sank into 
the flesh of the beast. 

Big Louis Morono, seeing the 
gang at work, whistled up his 
men and, using the high pressure 
hoses, drove the juvies from the 
scene.

Even as they fled, the Pelham 
Privateers indicated their frus- 
tration at having been thwarted. 
They mugged Trenchard and 
Goilvey where they stood, leaving 
the two tottering scientists even 
more tottered: face-down in the 
gutter, arguing through split lips 
and cracked teeth, “It’s too big 
to be a pterodactyl from our past 
... it has to be from the past, 
you twit . no, it’s from another 
planet . don’t be an ass, they 
don’t have pterodactyls on any 
planet in our solar system ... so 
it came from another solar sys- 
tem . how did it get here . 
that’s not my problem ...”

THE 

WRITTEN WORD 

A nd David, the King, having 
heard the reports of the mes- 
sengers called for his scribe so 
that he might send a letter to his 
commander in the field. 

The year, in round figures, is 
1000 B.C., and we are informed in 
II Samuel 8:16-17 that the king’s 
recorder was Jehoshaphat, the 
son of Ahilud, while the scribe 
was a man named Seraiah’. 



Unfortunately nothing is said 
about how the letter was written. 

We may take it for granted 
that the scribe wrote down what 
the king dictated, but it would 
be nice if we were also told just 
how he did his job. I do not 
mean the language; that probably 
was some early form of Aramaic. 
Nor do I care what letters he em- 
ployed, though it can also be 
taken for granted that it was al- 
ready alphabetical writing. What 
I want to know is what he wrote 
on and what he used for writing. 
We have to guess about this, 
though the guess has a rather high' 
probability. 

If the story of David’s letters 
had been written by Homer, 
about two centuries later, it would 
have taken a few more lines but 
we would know every detail for it 
would read about as follows: 

Quickly Seraiah the scribe (the 
name of his father is un- 
known) 

Mounted the terrace well screened 
from Helios’s rays that are 
burning. 

Carrying with him a bundle of 
dried reeds, prepared for 
writing. 

Also he brought with him ink- 
stones, some red as the sky 
looks at sunset. 

Others as black as the night at 
the time when white Selene 
fails to 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



Lighten the darkness. The ink- 
stones were fashioned with' 
skill by Simon, 

Weaver by trade is he, yet skill- 
ful in dyeing the cloth he 
has woven. 

Also the scribe carried some 
water for softening inkstones 
with rags dipp’d 
Into the fluid; and sheets of pa- 
pyrus from Egypt he carried. 
Almost as costly as gold, when 
weighed for trading. 

/^f course I have put all the 
available information about 
the scribe’s trade, as carried out 
in the areas of Egypt, Syria and 
Palestine into these pseudo-Ho- 
meric lines. The inkstones (also 
called ink cakes) were made of 
lampblack and some gummy sub- 
stance for black, or of iron oxides 
and a similar substance for red. 
They were then permitted to dry 
out for easier handling, which 
is the reason why the scribe 
had to carry, as clearly shown 
on some Egyptian monuments, 
a small water bucket with a few 
.rags for moistening the sur- 
face of the inkstone. The pen was 
a dried reed, cut obliquely at one 
end. The resulting broad point 
was then frayed, so that the 
scribe’s pen was about the same 
as the felt tip marker of our time. 

This is the equipment Seraiah 
must have had with him; but the 
conclusion that he wrote on pa- 

107 



pyrus is mainly based on the 
reasoning that he was the king’s 
scribe and that papyrus was ex- 
pensive. In reality he might have 
written on leather; there is an 
old wall painting dating back to 
the eighth century B.C. that 
shows two Assyrian scribes: one 
writes on what is obviously a clay 
tablet while the other holds some 
flexible material, probably leath- 
er. The painting shows the two 
principles of writing: by impres- 
sion into the writing surface and 
by making colored marks on a 
writing surface that is not al- 
tered otherwise. 

But before we go into this im- 
portant distinction of the two pos- 
sible methods of writing, let us 
say what can be said about pa- 
pyrus which has been the main 
writing surface for several thou- 
sands of years. We have only one 
account of how pap3mis was 
made, written by Pliny the Eld- 
er during the first century after 
Christ. Unfortunately Pliny’s ac- 
count is second hand, he had not 
observed the process itself. What 
he said is, therefore, incomplete in 
various ways, and his words could 
hardly be used as a guideline 
for duplicating the feat of the 
ancient Egyptian craftsmen. 

'^he reed, Pliny informs us, was 
first cut lengthwise into thin 
slices. Since the papyrus reed, the 
Cypents papyrus of the botan- 
108

Ahmar, early eighth century B.C.

probably leather. 

ists, grows anywhere from three 
to ten feet tall it must have been 
chopped into sections before it 
could be sliced lengthwise. Of 
course the sections from the cen- 
ter of the reed are the widest, so 
the papyrus made from center 
sections was most valuable. The 
sections were laid side by side 
on some backing until the area 
covered had reached a certain 
width, about one foot. Then a sec- 
ond layer of such sections was 
placed on top of the first, at a 
right angle to it. Then the two 
were somehow pressed together. 

GALAXY 



Pliny’s informant stated that pri- 
or to this they are moistened by 
Nile water: and Pliny concluded 
that Nile water, when muddy, 
must act like a glue. We now 
know that Nile water whether 
muddy or clear, does no sucK 
thing Very likely the papyrus 
makers added glue of some kind 
about which they kept quiet. The 
squares of papyrus were then 
joined together to make a “scroll” 
that, as a rule, was about 30 feet 
long. Longer rolls grew too bulky 
and were hard to handle. 

This, surprising as it may be 
to many, is the reason why a 
number of books of the Old Tes- 
tament (like Samuel, Kings and 
Chronicles) are now in two sec- 
tions. Written in Hebrew which 
writes consonants only, each of 
these books just about filled one 
scroll, but when translated into 
Greek, which does write the vow- 
els, and has many of their,, the 
books took up two scrolls. 

Of course an “ink” consisting 
of lampblack and a water-soluble 
glue would not cling to the pa- 
pyrus very well. Writing could 
easily be washed off a papyrus 
scroll — something that was con- 
sidered desirable because the 
scroll could then be used over 
again. 

Papyrus, as has been mention- 
ed, was expensive. 

It evidently had been invent- 
ed originally because there was 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



no other convenient writing mate- 
rial available. But what was, or 
could have been, used before pa- 
pyrus 

Well — slabs of stone, slabs of 
wood, the inner side of large 
pieces of tree bark, possibly the 
large hard leaves of some subtrop- 
ical plants. Just the listing of 
these objects suggests that the 
writing must have been of the “in- 
cised” variety, regardless of whe- 
ther pictographs or actual letters 
were used. In each case the pic- 
ture or the inscription had to be 
chiseled into the stone, c irved 
into the wood or the bark^ or 
scratched into the hard leaf. It 
is logical, keeping this back- 
ground in mind, that the Sume- 
rians and Assyrians took this 
kind of making marks for grant- 
ed, even though they used pre- 
pared writing surfaces, namely 
clay tablets. The writing instru- 
ment was a metal stylus that was 
pressed into the soft clay. And 
the marks they made, because of 
the materials used, assumed the 
typical shape we call cuneiform. 

When in high school I was in- 
formed that the use of clay tab- 
lets had the additional advan- 
tage that they could be made in- 
to permanent records by “firing” 

1 When it comes to tree bark one Is opt 
to think of burning the inscription into 
it with a red-hot piece of metal; but in 
ancient times nobody seems to have had 
that idea. 



109 



tKem in a potter’s kiln. Now we 
know that this was not done. 
They were simply sundried. 
The “fired” tablets we have in 
our museums owe their nature to 
later and absolutely unwanted 
conflagrations which they sur- 
vived. 

\ nother writing material for 
(incised) writing was sheet 
metal. Gold, silver, copper and 
lead are all soft metals which will 
accept an inscription easily, and 
it is likely that the earliest such 
inscriptions were a kind of dedica- 
tion on a gold or silver vessel 
given as a present to an impor- 
tant personage. One of the Dead 
Sea scrolls from Qumran is cop- 
per. A copper sheet could be roll- 
ed into a scroll with not too 
much effort. Unrolling it thou- 
sands of years later is the prob- 
lem. 

Leaden scrolls were quite com- 
mon, too. They have been found 
both in Italy and in Greece; a 
Greek translation of Psalm 80 
was found, inscribed on lead, on 
the Island of Rhodes. There are 
Punic and Hittite texts on lead, 
and in the Bible Job (19:23-24) 
says that he wishes his words 
were “written with an iron styl- 
us on lead.) 

Even in Roman times “in- 
cised” writing was still common. 
If somebody sent a petition to 
the senate, or wrote for posterity, 

110 



he used papyrus. But if he just 
wanted to send a message to a 
friend he employed what is cus- 
tomarily called a “tablet”. These 
tablets were very shallow wood- 
en troughs holding a layer of 
beeswax. Writing,, hence, was done 
with a metal stylus by impress- 
ing the pointed end of the styl- 
us in the wax. The other end of 
the stylus was flattened and used 
to smooth out mistakes. Once 
the message had become obsolete 
the tablet was erased simply by 
heating it until the wax formed 
a smooth surface again. It very 
quickly occurred to somebody 
that the message could be pro- 
tected by using another tablet as 
a cover; the two tablets were 
hinged together, waxed sides in- 
side, by metal rings, the earli- 
est form of a book. 

By that time papyrus Had 
found a competitor that was 
soon to win out because of dura- 
bility, resistance to water and 
for several other reasons. It was 
parchment. For many centuries 
credit was given to Eumenes II 
of Pergamum (197-158 B.C.) 
for Having invented parchment; 
we now know that parchment 
is older. Eumenes either improv- 
ed the process or did something 
else to make parchment more 
customary. Parchment is animal 
skin — sheepskin, goat’s skin or 
the skin of newborn calves — 
treated in a special manner to 

GALAXY 



make it smootK and white, by 
repeated washings, scrapings, 
stretchings and rubbing with’ 
pumice and with chalk. The 
best grade of parchment came 
from newly born lambs; it was 
labeled vellum. During the latter 
years of the Roman Empire it 
became customary for a time to 
stain vellum purple for greater 
elegance, and such stained vel- 
lum was used for documents of 
special significance. 

Meanwhile the Chinese had 
invented paper. As customary, 
some Chinese writers claimed that 
paper was invented very early 
in their history. More cautious 
European scholars — who are 
not trying to credit some illus- 
trious ancestor — have settled 
for the second century B.C. 
as the probable time of the in- 
vention of paper. While the ori- 
gin of paper in China is some- 
what obscure there is no doubt 
about the introduction of paper 
in the western countries. In 751 
A.D., the Arabs occupying So- 
markand were attacked by a 
Chinese army; Samarkand was 
such an important trading post 
that everybody wanted to have 
his hands on it. The Chinese lost, 
and two of the prisoners taken 
by the Arabs were skilled paper 
makers who willingly taught their 
craft to Arab and Persian arti- 
sans. Many paper manuscripts 
from the ninth century — usually 
FOR YOUR INFOR/MTION 



in Arabic — are still in existence. 
Beginning with the eleventh cen- 
tury they became common in 
Greece and very soon afterwards 
in the other European countries. 

TT^ith the introduction of pa- 
^ ' per the writing materials 
became standardized too. The 
universal writing instrument was 
the goose quill. Of course there 
were people who insisted that 
quills made from peacock feath- 
ers were superior. (One writing 
master who was questioned about 
the superiority of peacock quills 
by a prospective pupil replied 
cautiously that he was only sure 
they were more expensive.) 
Somebody, we do not know who 
or when or where, had invented 
ink in our sense; he would no 
doubt have been horrified as well 
as nonplussed if somebody could 
have told him in chemical ter- 
minology why and liow his ink 
worked. 

It works like this: so-called 
“green vitriol,” or ferrous sul- 
phate, is combined with tannin 
from the galls on leaves of walnut 
trees. This compound has a weak 
color, just enough to see what 
you have written. But upon dry- 
ing the ferrous salts oxidize into 
ferric salts, which are black, and 
then the writing appears distinct 
and clear. (At a later date a blue 
dye was added to the ink so that 
the written lines would show 

111 



up better immediately. Oxidation 
then changed the blue letters to 
black letters.) So the equipment 
of the “scribe” or student of the 
fourteenth century was simple: 
paper, an inkwell, a few goose 
quills and a small sharp knife 
for re- cutting the nibs of the 
quills when they needed it. When 
traveling 'the inkwell was replac- 
ed by the stoppered ink horn, 
which must have led to many 
messy accidents. The accidents, 
in turn, led to attempts to have 
the ink inside the pen. Early de- 
signs of probably unworkable 
fountain pens go back to about 
1500 A.D. 

By that time a competitor to 
pen and ink began to appear: the 
pencil. 

It had been the custom of 
copying monks and baronial 
bookkeepers all along to use a 
thin coin-shaped piece of lead to 
rule the parchment or paper be- 
fore writing on it. But if a piece 
of lead, guided by a ruler, could 
make visible marks on paper, 
why not use a lead stylus for 
writing? The marks made by ac- 
tual lead were too faint to be eas- 
ily legible, but something had 
just been brought on the market 
that went under the name of 
“Spanish lead,” namely graph- 
ite. That substance made strong 
and visible marks especially on 
paper (less so on vellum). 

An illustration in the last book 
112 



of the Swiss physician and nat- 
uralist Conrad Gesner shows how 
the early pencils — called sty- 
lus inieiius — looked: the “lead” 
was fairly thick encased in a 
wooden holder with a center hole. 
A screw at the end of the pencil 
seems to indicate that the “lead” 
could slide inside the wooden 
holder and was advanced by the 
screw as it was used up. The 
book is dated 1565, and the de- 
vice seems to have been fairly 
new then, but it found favor fast. 
In 1595 Count Johann the 
Younger of Nassau issued an in- 
struction to the officers of the 
heavy cavalry saying that “the 
pens of Spanish lead must not 
be forgotten, for they are far 
more useful to riders than ink 
horn and quills.” 

■f T Thile we now use all kinds of 
’ ’ devices, from rubber stamps 
via pencils, fountain pens and 
ballpoint pens to typewriters and 
teletype machines for making 
marks on paper, paper is virtual- 
ly the only substance used as a 
writing surface. Ceremonial in- 
scriptions are still chiseled in 
stone or cast in bronze, but oth- 
erwise it is always that fragile 
and combustible substance called 
paper. To give a limited immor- 
tality to the thoughts put on a 
fragile paper we have adopted the 
biological survival principle of 
large numbers and successive 

GALAXY 



generations. A book no longer 
exists in a dozen or so Handwrit- 
ten copies on durable parchment. 
It exists in thousands of copies 
on paper. Then there are reprints 
of the original book, paperback 
editions (in tens of thousands of 
copies) and, at a later date, fac- 
simile reprints and microfilms. 

Will paper, at some time, be re- 
placed by something else? 

Probably, but not by some- 
thing we already know. Thin 
metal sheets — for a short time 
favored in science fiction as 
printing stock — are always 
heavier than paper, square inch 
for square inch and have other 
disadvantages, too. Maybe a plas- 
tic will come along that does not 
weigh more than paper, or at 
least not much' more, a plastic 
that will not discolor with time 
and will not be destroyed by fire. 
Then the chemistry of writing 
may be changed, too. Instead of 
adding something to the paper, 
graphite or a dye, the process 
of making marks may be to cause 
a visible chemical change brought 
about by the chemical interaction 
vrith the material of the stylus. 

In saying this I have the ev- 
eryday forms of writing in mind, 
like letters, memos, monthly 
charge statements and related 
pleasantries. I disregarded such 
things as information storage in 
the memory units of a computer. 

But this brings up the field 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



of electronics and with it the 
one occasion where a written 
message cannot be put on paper 
for transmission; a message to 
somewhere in space and to some- 
one who, while his intelligence is 
assumed to be high, could not 
read a written message simply 
because he does not know our 
letters. Dr. Stillman Drake once 
sent a message to friends. He did

interstellar message.

Fip, Z. ’e><?c^ing rf the infe»’steltc»r r>essoge. 



it on paper all right but used 
only two symbols, representing 
electric impulses. 

Since I know that I am slowly 
running out of space I’ll not 
copy Dr. Drake’s fairly long 
message but make up a shorter 
example. Here it is, addressed to 
a fellow creature on Alpha Cen- 
taur! A-S. 

+00 000 000 000 +0+ 0+0 0+0 
0 ++ +00 0+0 0 +++ 0 + 0+0 0+0

000 0+0 ++0 +++ +00 + 0 + 0 ++ 
OH — t ++0 + 

The addressee can proceed in 
one manner only, beginning with 
counting the pulses. Their total 
number is 91; of this there are 

114 



55 “o” spaces and 36 “-1-” signs. 
The ratio of 55 to 36 carries no 
meaning nor does the ratio of 
either of these two figures to the 
total. However, the total is the 
product of two primes, namely 
7 and 13; it is not the product of 
any other two figures. So a rec- 
tangle 7 units wide and 13 units 
tall is involved, or else one 7 units 
tall and 13 units wide. 

Constructing such a rectangle 
the addressee decides to blacken 
each square on which a -f- sign 
falls. The message begins with a 
-f- sign, meaning that the first 
corner square must be marked, a 
logical beginning. But the final 
result is anything but logical or 
meaningful — see Fig. 2. (In 
case anybody wonders: yes, I 

GALAXY 



was quite worried while drawing 
the illustration that it accidental- 
ly might make some sense. For- 
tunately it didn’t.) 

Well, our extraterrestrial will 
say, either I don’t undcr.itand 
their meaning, or else the rec- 
tangle has to lie on its side in- 
stead of standing upright. Trying 
this construction he finds the top 
line empty, except that both its 
ends arc marked, which is logical. 
And then the pattern becomes 
clear; three variations on the 
square of 3 and, at the bottom, 
a 2 followed by its square and its 
cube. It does not mean much in 
itself, for obviously people who 



can squirt short-wave signals in- 
to space must be acquainted with 
squares and cubes and much else 
besides. But as a mere prelimin- 
ary message, demonstrating the 
principle to be used it is fine. 
The next message then might 
contain 187 imits (11 by 17), 
the one after that 247 units 
(13 by 19) and the fourth 391 
units (17 by 23), ujing larger 
and larger primes. A message of 
551 units (19 by 29) would con- 
tain enough small squares to 
produce reasonable pwetures and 
the transmission of ac'.ual infor- 
mation could begin.

for eviction he would have been 
refused. 

But Owen Jennison just did 
not answer his doorbell or his 
room phone. Nobody could re- 
call seeing him in many weeks. 
Apparently the manager want- 
ed to know that he was all 
right. 

And so he was allowed to use 
his passkey, with an officer stand- 
ing by. 

And so they found the tenant 
of 1809. 

And when they looked in his 
wallet, they called me. 

I was at my desk in ARM’s 
Headquarters, making useless 
notes and wishing it were lunch- 
time. 

At this stage the Loren case 
was all correlate-and-wait. It in- 
volved an organlegging gang, ap- 
parently run by a single man, 
yet big enough to cover Half the 
Nortli American west coast. We 
had considerable data on the 
gang — methods of operation, 
centers of activity, a few former 
customers, even a tentative Hand- 
ful of names — but nothing that 
would give us an excuse to act. 
So it was a matter of shoving 
what we Had into the computer, 
watching tHe few suspected asso- 
ciates of the ganglord Loren, and 
waiting for a break. 

The months of waiting were 
118 



ruining my sense of involvement. 
My phone buzzed. 

I put the pen down and said, 
“Gil Hamilton.” 

A small dark face regarded me 
with soft black eyes. “I am De- 
tective-Inspector Julio Ordaz of 
the Los Angeles Police Depart- 
ment. Are you related to an Owen 
Jennison?” 

“Owen? No, we’re not related. 
Is he in trouble?” 

“You do know him, then.” 
“Sure I know him. Is he here, 
on Earth?” 

“It would seem so.” Ordaz Had 
no accent, but the lack of collo- 
quialisms in his speech made him 
sound vaguely foreign. “We will 
need positive identification, Mr. 
Hamilton. Mr. Jennison’s ident 
lists you as next of kin.” 

“That’s funny. I . Back in 
a minute. What’s happened? Is 
Owen dead?” 

“Somebody is dead, Mr. Ham- 
ilton. He carried Mr. Jennison’s 
ident in his wallet.” 

“Okay. Now, Owen Jennison 
was a citizen of the Belt. This 
may have interworld complica- 
tions. That makes it ARM’s busi- 
ness. Where’s the body?” 

“We found him in an apart- 
ment rented under his own name. 
Monica Apartments, Lower Los 
Angeles, room 1809.” 

“Good. Don’t move anything 
you haven’t moved already. I’ll 
be right over.” 



GALAXY 



■|\ yr onica Apartments was a 
nearly featureless concrete 
block, eighty stories tall, a thou- 
sand feet across the edges of its 
square base. Lines of small bal- 
conies gave the sides a sculptured 
look, above a forty-foot inset 
ledge that would keep tenants 
from dropping objects on pedes- 
trians. A himdred buildings just 
like it made Lower Los Angeles 
look lumpy from the air. 

Inside was a lobby done in 
anonymous modern. Lots of met- 
al and plastic showing; light- 
weight, comfortable chairs with- 
out arms; big ash trays; plenty 
of indirect lighting; a low ceiling; 
no wasted space. The whole room 
might have been stamped out 
with a die. It wasn’t supposed 
to look small, but it did, and 
that warned you what the rooms 
would look like. 

I found the manager’s office 
and the manager, a soft-looking 
man with watery-blue eyes. His 
conservative paper suit, dark 
red, seemed chosen to render him 
invisible, as did the style of his 
brown hair, worn long and corn- 
ed straight back without a part. 
“Nothing like this has ever hap- 
pened here,’’ he confided as he 
led me to the elevator banks. 
“Nothing. It would have been bad 
enough without his being a Belt- 
er, but now — ” He cringed at 
the thought. “Newsmen. They’ll 
smother us.” 

THE ORGANLEGGERS 



The elevator was coffin-sized, 
but with the handrails on the in- 
side. It went up fast and smooth. 
I stepped out into a long, nar- 
row hallway. 

What would Owen have been 
doing in a place like this, Ma- 
chinery lived here, not people. 

Maybe it wasn’t Owen. Ordaz 
had been reluctant to commit 
himself. Besides, there’s no law 
against picking pockets. You 
couldn’t enforce such a law on 
this crowded planet. Everyone on 
Earth was a pickpocket. 

Sure. Someone had died carry- 
ing Owen’s wallet. 

I walked down the hallway to 
1809. 

Tt was Owen who sat grinning 
in the armchair. I took one 
good look at him, enough to be 
sure, and then I looked away and 
didn’t look back. But the rest of 
it was even more unbelievable. 

No Belter could have taken 
that apartment. I was born in 
Kansas; but even I felt the aw- 
ful anonymous cliill. It would 
have driven Owen bats. 

“I don’t believe it,” I said. 

“Did you know him well, Mr. 
Hamilton?” 

“About as well as two men can 
know each other. He and I spent 
three years mining rocks in the 
main asteroid belt. You don’t 
keep secrets under those condi- 
tions.”

“Yet you didn’t know he was 
on Earth.” 

“That’s what I can’t under- 
stand. Why the blazes didn’t He 
phone me if he was in trouble?” 

“You’re an ARM,” said Ordaz. 
“An operative in the United Na- 
tions Police.” 

He had a point. Owen was as 
honorable as any man 1 knew; 
but honor isn’t the same in the 
Belt. Bdters think flatlanders 
are all crooks. They don’t under- 
stand that to a flatlander, pick- 
ing pockets is a game of skill. Yet 
a Belter sees smuggling as the 
same kind of game, with no dis- 
honesty involved. He balances 
the thirty percent tariff against 
possible confiscation of his cargo, 
and if the odds are right he gam- 
bles. 

Owen could Have been doing 
something sticky,” I admitted. 
“But I can’t see him killing him- 
self over it. And . not here. He 
wouldn’t Have come Here.” 

1809 was a living room and a 
bathroom and a closet. I’d 
glanced into the bathroom, know- 
ing what I would find. It was the 
size of a comfortable shower stall. 
An adjustment panel outside the 
door would cause it to extrude 
various appurtenances in mem- 
ory plastic, to become a wash- 
room, a shower stall, a toilet, a 
dressing room, a steam cabinet. 
Luxurious in everything but size, 
if you pushed the right buttons. 
120 



The living room was more of 
the same. A King bed was invisi- 
ble behind a wall. The kitchen 
alcove, with basin and oven and 
grill and toaster, would fold into 
another wall; lire sofa, chairs and 
tables would vanish into the floor. 
One teiiiint and three guests 
would make a crowded cocktail 
party, a cosy diimer gathering, 
a closed poker game. Card table, 
dinner table, coffee table were 
all there, surrounded by the ap- 
propriate chairs; but only one 
set St a time would emerge from 
the floor. There was no refrig- 
erator, no freezer, no bar. If a 
tenant needed food or drink, he 
phoned down, and the supermar- 
ket on the third floor would send 
it up. 

The tenant of such an apart- 
ment had his comfort. But he 
owned nothing. There was room 
for him; there was none for his 
possessions. This was one of 
the inner apartments. An age ago 
there would have been an air 
shaft; but air shafts took up ex- 
pensive room. The tenant didn’t 
even have a window. He lived in 
a comfortable box. 

J ust now the items extruded 
were the overstuffed reading 
armchair, two small side tables, a 
footstool, and the kitchen alcove. 
Owen Jennison sat grinning in 
the armchair. Naturally he grin- 
ned. Little more than dried skin 

GALAXY 



covered the natural grin of his 
skull. 

“It’s a small room,” said Or- 
daz, “but not too small. Millions 
of people live this way. In any 
case, a Belter would hardly be 
a claustrophobe.” 

“No. Owen flew a singleship 
before he joined us. Three 
months at a stretch, in a cabin 
so small you couldn’t stand up 
with the airlock closed. Not claus- 
trophobia, but — ” I swept my 
arm about the room. “What do 
you see that’s his?” 

Small as it was, the closet was 
nearly empty. A set of street 
clothes, a paper shirt, a pair of 
shoes, a small brown overnight 
case. All new. The few items in 
the bathroom medicine chest had 
been equally new and equally 
anonymous. 

Ordaz said, “Well?” 

“Belters are transients. They 
don’t own much, but what they 
do own, they guard. Small pos- 
sessions, relics, souvenirs. I can’t 
believe he wouldn’t have had 
something.” 

Ordaz lifted an eyebrow. “His 
space suit?” 

“You think that’s unlikely? It’s 
not. The inside of his pressure 
suit is a Belter’s home. Sometimes 
it’s the only home he’s got. He 
spends a fortune decorating it. 
If he loses his suit, he’ not a Belt- 
er any more. 

“No, I don’t insist he’d have 
THE ORGANLEGGERS 



brought his suit. But he’d have 
had something. His phial of 
marsdust. The bit of nickel -iron 
they took out of his chest. Or, if 
he left all his souvenirs home, 
he’d have picked up things on 
Earth. But in this room — 
there’s nothing.” 

“Perhaps,” Ordaz suggested 
delicately, “he didn’t notice his 
surroundings.” 

And somehow that brought it 
all home. 

O wen Jennison sat grinning in 
a water-stained silk dressing 
gown. His space-darkened face 
lightened abruptly beneath his 
chin, giving way to normal sun- 
tan. His blond hair, too long, 
had been cut Earth style; no trace 
remained of the Belter strip cut 
he’d worn all his life. A month’s 
growth of untended beard cover- 
ed half his face. A small black 
cylinder protruded from the top 
of his head. An electric cord 
trailed from the top of the cylin- 
der and ran to a small wall 
socket. 

The cylinder was a droud, a 
current addict’s transformer. 

I stepped closer to the corpse 
and bent to look. The droud was 
a standard make, but it had been 
altered. Your standard current 
addict’s droud will pass only a 
trickle of current into the brain. 
Owen must have been getting ten 
times the usual charge, easily 

121 



enough to damage his brain in a 
month’s time. 

I reached out and touched the 
droud with my imaginary hand. 

Ordaz was standing quietly be- 
side me, letting me make my ex- 
amination without interruption. 
Naturally he had no way of 
knowing about my restricted psi 
powers. 

Restricted was the operative 
word. I had two psychic powers: 
telekinesis and esper. With the 
esper sense I could sense the 
shapes of objects at a distance; 
but the distance was the reach of 
an extra right arm. I could lift 
small objects, if they were no fur- 
ther away than the fingertips of 
an imaginary right Hand. The re- 
striction was a flaw in my own 
imagination. Since I could not 
believe my imaginary hand would 
reach further than that ... it 
wouldn’t. 

Even so limited a psi power 
can be useful. With my imagin- 
ary fingertips I touched the droud 
in Owen’s head, then ran them 
down to a tiny hole in his scalp, 
and further. 

It was a standard surgical job. 
Owen could have had it done 
anyw^here. A hole in his scalp, in- 
visible under the hair, nearly im- 
possible to find even if you knew 
what you were looking for. Even 
your best friends wouldn’t know, 
unless they caught you with the 
droud plugged in. But the tiny 
122 



hole marked a bigger plug set 
in the bone of the skull. I touched 
the ecstasy plug with my imag- 
inary fingertips, then ran them 
down the hair-fine wire going 
deep into Owen’s brain, down in- 
to the pleasure center. 

No, the extra current hadn’t 
killed him. What had killed 
Owen was his lack of will power. 
He had been unwilling to get up. 

T T e had starved to death sitting 
in that chair. There were 
plastic squeezebottles all around 
his feet and a couple still on the 
end table. All empty. They must 
have been full a month ago. Owen 
hadn’t died of thirst. He had 
died of starvation, and his death 
had been planned. 

Owen my crewmate. Why 
hadn’t he come to me? I’m half a 
Belter myself. Whatever his trou- 
ble, I’d have gotten him out 
somehow. A little smuggling — 
what of it? Why had he arranged 
to tell me only after it was over? 

The apartment was so clean; 
so clean. You had to bend close 
to smeU the death; the air con- 
ditioning whisked it all away. 

He’d been very methodical. 
The kitchen was open so that a 
catheter could lead from Owen to 
the sink. He’d given himself 
enough water to last out the 
month ; he’d paid his rent a month 
in advance. He’d cut the droud 
cord by hand, and he’d cut it 

GALAXY 



short, deliberately tethering him- 
self to a wall socket beyond 
reach of the kitchen. 

A complex way to die, but re- 
warding in its way. A month of 
ecstasy, a month of the highest 
physical pleasure man can attain. 
I could imagine him giggling ev- 
ery time he remembered he was 
starving to death. With food only 
a few footsteps away . but he’d 
have to pull out the droud to 
reach it. Perhaps he postponed 
the decision, and postponed it 
again . 

Owen and I and Homer Chan- 
drasekhar, we had lived for three 
years in a cramped shell sur- 
rounded by vacuum. What was 
there to know about Owen Jen- 
nison that I hadn’t known? 
Where was the weakness we did 
not share? If Owen had done 
this, so could I. And I was afraid. 

tf\rery neat,” I whispered. 

^ “Belter neat.” 

“Typically Belter, would you 
say?” 

“I would not. Belters don’t 
commit suicide. Certainly not 
this way. If a Belter had to go, 
he’d blow his ship’s drive and 
die like a star. The neatness is 
typical. The result isn’t.” 

“Well,” said Ordaz. “Well.” 
He was uncomfortable. The facts 
spoke for themselves, yet he was 
reluctant to call me a liar. He fell 
back on formality. 

THE ORGANLEGGERS 



“Mr. Hamilton, do you iden- 
tify this man as Owen Jennison?” 

“It’s him.” He’d always been a 
touch overweight, yet I’d recog- 
nized him the moment I saw 
him. “But let’s be sure.” I pulled 
the dirty dressing gown back 
from Owen’s shoulder. A near- 
perfect circle of scar tissue, eight 
inches across, spread over the left 
side of his chest. “See that?” 

“We noticed it, yes. An old 
burn?” 

“Owen’s the only man I know 
who could show you a meteor 
scar on his skin. It blasted him 
in the shoulder one day while he 
was outside the ship. Sprayed va- 
porized pressure-suit steel all 
over his skin. The doc pulled a 
tiny grain of nickle-iron from the 
center of the scar, just below the 
skin. Owen always carried that 
grain of nickel-iron. Always,” I 
said, looking at Ordaz. 

“We didn’t find it.” 

“Okay.” 

“I’m sorry to put you through 
this, Mr. Hamilton. It was you 
who insisted we leave the body 
in situ.” 

“Yes. Thank you.” 

Owen grinned at me from the 
reading chair. I felt the pain, 
■in my throat and in the pit of my 
stomach. Once I had lost my 
right arm. Losing Owen felt the 
same way. 

“I’d like to know more about 
this,” I said. “Will you let me 

123 



know the details as soon as you 
get them?” 

“Of course. Through the ARM’s 
office?” 

“Yes.” This wasn’t ARM’s 
business, despite what I’d told 
Ordaz, but ARM’s prestige would 
help. “I want to know why Owen 
died. Maybe he just cracked up 
. culture shock or something. 
But if someone hounded him to 
death, I’ll have his blood.” 

“Surely the administration of 
justice is better left to — ” Or- 
daz stopped, confused. Did I 
speak as an ARM or as a citizen? 

I left him wondering. 

'^he lobby held a scattering of 
tenants entering and leav- 
ing elevators or just sitting 
around. I stood outside the ele- 
vator for a moment, searching 
passing faces for the erosion of 
personality that must be there. 

Mass-produced comfort. Room 
to sleep and eat and watch tri- 
dee, but no room to be anyone. 
Living here, one would own noth- 
ing. What kind of people would 
live like that? They should have 
looked all alike, moved in uni- 
son, like the string of images in a 
barber’s mirrors. 

Then I spotted wavy brown 
hair and a dark red paper suit. 
The manager? I had to get close 
before I was sure. His face was 
the face of a permanent stran- 
ger. 

124 



He saw me coming and smiled 
without enthusiasm. “Oh, hello, 
Mr. uh . Did you find 
. ” He couldn’t think of the 
right question. 

“Yes,” I said, answering it any- 
way. “But I’d like to know some 
things. Owen Jennison lived here 
for six weeks, right?” 

“Six weeks and two days, be- 
fore we opened his room.” 
“Did he ever have visitors?” 
The man’s eyebrows went up. 
We’d drifted in the direction of 
his office, and I was close enough 
to read the name on the door: 
JASPER MILLER, Manager. 
“Of course not,” he said. “Any- 
one would have noticed that 
something was wrong.” 

“You mean he took the room 
for the express purpose of dying? 
You saw him once, and never 
again?” 

“I suppose he might . no, 
wait.” The manager thought 
deeply. 

“No. He registered on a 
Thursday. I noticed the Belter 
tan, of course. Then on Friday 
he went out. I happened to see 
him pass.” 

“Was that the day he got the 
droud? No, skip it, you wouldn’t 
know that. Was it the last time 
you saw him go out?” 

“Yes, it was.” 

“Then he could have Kad vis- 
itors late Thursday or early Fri- 
day.” 



GALAXY 



'^he manager shook his head, 
very positively. 

“Why not?” 

“You see, Mr. uH . ” 
“Hamilton.” 

“We have a holo camera on 
every floor, Mr. Hamilton. It 
takes a picture of each tenant 
the first time he goes to his room, 
and then never again. Privacy is 
one of the services a tenant buys 
with his room.” The manager 
drew himself up a little as he 
said this. “For the same reason, 
the holocamera takes a picture 
of anyone who is not a tenant. 
The tenants are thus protected 
from unwarranted intrusions.” 
“And there were no visitors to 
any of the rooms on Owen’s 
floor?” 

“No, sir, there were not.” 
“Your tenants are a solitary 
bunch.” 

“Perhaps they are.” 

“I suppose a computer in the 
basement decides who is and is 
not a tenant.” 

“Of course.” 

“So for six weeks Owen Jenni- 
son sat alone in his room. In all 
that time he was totally ignored.” 
Miller tried to turn his voice 
cold, but he was too nervous. “We 
try to give our guests privacy. If 
Mr. Jennison had wanted help 
of any kind he had only to pick 
up the house phone. He could 
have called me, or the pharmacy, 
or the supermarket downstairs.” 
THE ORGANLEGGERS 



“Well, thank you, Mr. Miller. 
That’s all I wanted to know. I 
wanted to know how Owen Jen- 
nison could wait six weeks to die 
while nobody noticed.” 

Miller swallowed. “He was dy- 
ing all that time?” 

“Yah.” 

“We had no way of knowing. 
How could we? I don’t see how 
you can blame us.” 

“I don’t either,” I said, and 
brushed by. Miller had been close 
enough, so I had lashed out at 
him. Now I was ashamed. The 
man was perfectly right. Owen 
could have had help if he’d 
wanted it. 

I stood outside, looking up at 
the jagged blue line of sky that 
showed between the tops of the 
buildings. A taxi floated into 
view, and I beeped my clicker 
at it, and it dropped. 

T went back to ARM headquar- 
ters. Not to work — I could 
not have done any work, not un- 
der the circumstances — but to 
talk to Julie. 

Julie. A tall girl, pushing thirty, 
with green eyes and long hair 
streaked red and gold. And two 
wide brown forceps marks above 
her right knee; but they weren’t 
showing now. I looked into her 
office, through the one-way glass, 
and watched her at work. 

She sat in a contour coucH, 
smoking. Her eyes were closed. 

125 



Sometimes her brow would fur- 
row as she concentrated. Some- 
times she would snatch a glance 
at the clock, then close her eyes 
again. 

I didn’t interrupt her. I knew 
the importance of what she was 
doing. 

Julie. She wasn’t beautiful. Her 
eyes were a little too far apart, 
her chin too square, her mouth 
too wide. It didn’t matter. Be- 
cause Julie could read minds. 

She was the ideal date. She 
was everything a man needed. A 
year ago, the day after the night 
I killed my first man, I had been 
in a terribly destructive mood. 
Somehow Julie had turned it into 
a mood of manic exhileration. 
We’d run wild through a super- 
vised anarchy park, running up 
an enormous bill. We’d hiked 
five miles without going any- 
where, facing backward on a 
downtown slidewalk. At the end 
we’d been utterly fatigued, too 
tired to think . But two weeks 
ago it had been a warm, cuddly, 
comfortable night. Two people 
happy with each other; no more 
than that. Julie was what you 
needed, anytime, anywhere. 

Her male harem must have 
been the largest in history. To 
pick up on the thoughts of a 
male ARM, Julie had to be in 
love with him. Luckily there was 
room in her for a lot of love. 
She didn’t demand that we be 
126 



faithful. A good half of us were 
married. But there had to be 
love for each of Julie’s men, or 
Julie couldn’t protect him. 

She was protecting us now. 
Each fifteen minutes, Julie was 
making contact with a specific 
ARM agent. Psi powers are noto- 
riously undependable, but Julie 
was an exception. If we got in a 
hole, Julie was always there to 
get us out . provided some idiot 
didn’t interrupt her at work. 

So I stood outside, waiting, 
with a cigarette in my imaginary 
hand. 

T he cigarette was for practice, 
to stretch the mental mus- 
cles. In its way my “hand” was 
as dependable as Julie’s mind- 
touch, possibly because of its 
very limitations. Doubt your psi 
powers and they’re gone. A rigid- 
ly defined third arm was more 
reasonable than some warlock 
ability to make objects move by 
wishing at them. I knew how an 
arm felt, and what it would do. 

Why do I spend so much time 
lifting cogarettes? Well, it’s the 
biggest weight I can lift without 
strain. And there’s another rea- 
son . something taught me by 
Owen. 

At ten minutes to fifteen, Julie 
opened her eyes, rolled out of the 
contour coucH and came to the 
door. “Hi, Gil,” she said sleep- 
ily. “Trouble?” 



GALAXY 



“Yali. A friend of mine just died. 
I thought you’d better knovf," I 
handed her a cup of coffee. 

She nodded- We had a date 
tonight, and this would change 
its character. Knowing that, she 
probed lightly. 

“My God!” she said, recoiling. 
“How . how horrible. I’m ter- 
ribly sorry, Gil. Date’s off, right?” 

“Unless you want to join the 
ceremonial drunk.” 

She shook her head vigorously. 
“I didn’t know him. It wouldn’t 
be proper. Besides, you’ll be wal- 
lowing in your own memories, Gil. 
A lot of them will be private. I’d 
cramp your style if you knew I 
was there to probe. Now if Phii 
Chandrasekhar were here, it’d be 
different.” 

“I wish he were. He’ll have to 
throw his own drunk. Maybe with 
some of Owen’s girls, if they’re 
around.” 

“You know what I feel,” she 
said. 

“Just what I do.” 

“I wish I could help.” 

“You always help.” I glanced 
at the clock. “Your coffee break’s 
about over.” 

“Slave driver.” Julie took my 
earlobe between thumb and fore- 
finger. “Do him proud,” she said, 
and went back to her soundproof 
room. 

She always helps. She doesn’t 
even have to speak. Just know- 
ing that Julie has read my 
THE ORGANLtGGERS 



thoughts, that someone under-* 
stands . that’s enough. 

A 11 alone at three in the after- 
noon, I started my ceremoni- 
al drunk. 

The ceremonial drunk is a 
young custom, not yet tied down 
by formality. There is no set du- 
ration. No specific toasts must be 
given. Those wHo participate 
must be close friends of the de- 
ceased. but there is no set num- 
ber of participants. 

I started at the Luau, a place 
of cool blue light and running 
water Outside it was fifteen- 
thirty in the afternoon, but in- 
side it was evening in the Ha- 
waiian Islands of centuries ago. 
Already the place was half full. 
I picked a corner table with 
considerable elbow room and di- 
aled for a Luau Grog. It came, 
cold, brown and alcoholic, its 
straw tucked into a cone of ice. 

There had been three of us 
at Cubes Forsythe’s cererronial 
drunk, one black Cores night 
four years ago. A sorry group we 
were, too; Owen and me and the 
widow of our third crewman. 
Gwen Forsythe blamed us for her 
husband’s death. I was just out 
of the hospital with a right arm 
that ended at the shoulder, and I 
blamed Cubes and Owen and my- 
self, all at once. Even Owen had 
turned dour and introspective. 
We couldn’t Have picked a worse

trio, or a worse night for it if 

we’d tried. 

But custom called, and we were 
tfiere. Then as now, I found my- 
self probing my own personality 
for the wound that was missing 
crewman, a missing friend. In- 
trospecting. 

Gilbert Hamilton. Bom of flat- 
lander parents, in April, 2093, in 
Topeka, Kansas. Bom with two 
arms and no sign of wild tal- 
ents. 

Flatlander: a Belter term re- 
ferring to Earthmen, and parti- 
cularly to Earthmen wKo had 
never seen space. I’m not sure 
my parents ever looked at the 
stars. They managed the third 
largest farm in Kansas, ten square 
miles of arable land between two 
wide strips of city paralleling 
two strips of turnpike. We were 
city people, like all flatlanders, 
but when the crowds got to be 
too much for my brothers and 
me, we had vast stretches of land 
to be alone in. Ten square miles 
of playground, with nothing to 
hamper us but the crops and 
automachinery. 

We looked at the stars, my 
brothers and I. You couldn’t see 
stars from the city; the lights 
hide them. Even in the fields you 
couldn’t see them around the 
lighted horizon. But straight 
overhead, they were there: black 
sky scattered with bright dots, 
and sometimes a flat tdiite moon. 
128 



\ t twenty I gave up my UN 
citizenship to become a Belt- 
er. I wanted stars, and the Belt 
government holds title to most 
of the solar system. There are 
fabulous riches in the rocks, rich- 
es belonging to a scattered civ- 
ilization of a few hundred thou- 
sand Belters; and I wanted my 
share of that, too. 

It wasn’t easy. I wouldn’t be 
eligible for a singleship license 
for ten years. Meanwhile I would 
be working for others and learn- 
ing to avoid mistakes before they 
killed me. Half the flatlanders 
who join the Belt die in space be- 
bore they can earn their licenses. 

I mined tin on Mercury and ex- 
otic chemicals from Jupiter’s 
atmosphere. I hauled ice from 
Saturn’s rings and quicksilver 
from Europa. One year our pilot 
made a mistake pulling up to a 
new rock, and we damn near had 
to walk home. Cubes Fors 5 rthe 
was with us then. He managed 
to fix the com laser and aim it 
at Icarus to bring us help. An- 
other time the mechanic who did 
the maintenance job on our ship 
forgot to replace an absorber, 
and we all got roaring .drunk on 
the alcohol that built up in our 
breathing-air. The three of us 
caught the mechanic six months 
later. I hear he lived. 

Most of the time I was part 
of a three-man crew. The mem- 
bers changed constantly. When 

GALAXY 



Owen Jennison joined us he re- 
placed a man who had finally 
earned his singleship license and 
couldn’t wait to start hunting 
rocks on his own. He was too 
eager. I learned later that he’d 
made one round trip and half of 
another. 

Owen was my age, but more 
experienced, a Belter born and 
bred. His blue eyes and blond 
cockatoo’s crest were startling 
against the dark of his Belter 
tan, the tan that ended so abrupt- 
ly where his neck ring cut off the 
space-intense sunlight his helmet 
let through. He was permanently 
chubby, but in free fall it was 
as if he’d been bom with wings. 
I took to copying his way of 
moving, much to Cubes’ amuse- 
ment. 

I didn’t make my own mistake 
until I was twenty-six. 

We were using bombs to put a 
rock in a new orbit. A contract 
job. The technique is older than 
fusion drives, as old as early Belt 
colonization, and it’s still cheap- 
er and faster than using a ship’s 
drive to tow the rock. You use 
industrial fusion bombs small 
and clean, and you get them so 
that each explosion deepens the 
crater to channel the force of 
later blasts. 

We’d set four blasts already, 
four white fireballs that swelled 
and faded as they rose. When the 
fifth blast went off we were hov- 
THE ORGANLEGGERS 



ering nearby on the other side of 
the rock. 

The fifth blast shattered the 
rock. 

Cubes had set the bomb. My 
own mistake was a shared one, 
because any of the three of us 
should have had the sense to take 
off right then. Instead, we watch- 
ed, cursing, as valuable oxygen- 
bearing rock became near-value- 
less shards. We watched the 
shards spread slowly into a 
cloud . and while we watched, 
one fast-moving shard reached 
us. Moving too slowly to vaporize 
when it hit, it nonetheless sheer- 
ed through a triple crystal-iron 
hull, slashed through my upper 
arm, and pinned Cubes Forsythe 
to a wall by his own heart. 

IV 

\ couple of nudists came in. 

They stood blinking among 
the booths while their eyes ad- 
justed to the blue twilight, then 
converged with glad cries on the 
group two tables over. I watch- 
ed and listened with an eye and 
an ear, thinking how different 
flatlander nudists were from Belt- 
er nudists. These all looked alike. 
They all had muscles, they had 
no interesting scars, they carried 
their credit cards in identical 
shoulder pouches, and they all 
shaved the same areas. 

... We always went nudist in 

129 



the big bases. Most people did. It 
was a natiiral reaction to tKe 
pressure suits we wore day and 
night while out in the rocks. Get 
him into a shortsleeve environ- 
ment, and your normal Belter 
sneers at a shirt. But it’s only 
for comfort. Give him a good rea- 
son, and your Belter will don 
shirt and pants as quickly as the 
next guy. 

But not Owen. After he got 
that meteor scar, I never saw him 
wear a shirt. Not just in the 
Ceres domes, but anywhere there 
was air to breath. He just had to 
show that scar. 

A cool blue mood settled on 
me, and I remembered . , 

. Owen Jennison lounging on 
a corner of my hospital bed, tell- 
ing me of the trip back. I could 
not remember anything after that 
rock sheered through my arm. 

I should have bled to death in 
seconds. Owen hadn’t given me 
the chance. The wound was rag- 
ged; Owen had sliced it clean to 
the shoulder with one swipe of a 
com laser. Then he’d tied a length 
of fiberglass curtain over the flat 
surface and knotted it tight under 
my remaining armpit. He told me 
about putting me under two at- 
mospheres of pure oxygen as a 
substitute for replacing the blood 
I’d lost. He told me how he’d 
reset the fusion drive for four 
gees to get me back in time. By 
rights we should have gone up 
130 



in a cloud of starfire and glory. 

“So there goes my reputation. 
The whole Belt knows how I re- 
wired our drive. A lot of ’em fig- 
ure if I’m stupid enough to risk 
my own life like that, I’d risk 
theirs too.” 

“So you’re not safe to travel 
with.” 

“Just so. They’re starting to 
call me Four Gee Jeimison.” 
“You think you’ve got prob- 
lems? I can just see how it’ll be 
when I get back to this bed. ‘You 
do something stupid, GU?’ The 
hell of it is, it was stupid.” 

“So lie a Httle.” 

“Uh huh. Can we sell the 
ship?” 

“Nope. Gwen inherited a third 
interest in it from Cubes. She 
won’t sell.” 

“Then we’re effectively broke.” 
“Except for the ship. We need 
another crevwnan.” 

“Correction. You need two 
crewmen. Unless you want to fly 
with a one-armed man. I can’t 
afford a transplant.” 

/^wen hadn’t tried to offer me 
a loan. That would have 
been insulting, even if he’d Had 
the money. “What’s wrong with a 
prosthetic?” 

“An iron arm? Sorry, no.” 
Owen had looked at me strange- 
ly, but all he’d said was, “Well, 
we’ll wait a bit. Maybe you’ll 
change your mind.” 



GALAXY 



He Hadn’t pressured me. Not 
then, and not later, after I’d left 
tKe Hospital and taken an apart- 
ment wKile I waited to get used 
to a missing arm. If He tHought 
I would eventually settle for a 
prostHetic, He was mistaken. 

WHy? It’s not a question I 
can answer. OtHers obviously feel 
differently; tKere are millions of 
people walking around witE met- 
al and plastic and silicone parts. 
Part man, part machine, and 
How do they tKemselves know 
wHicH is tfie real person? 

I’d ratKer be dead tKan part 
metal. Call it a quirk. Call it, 
even, tHe same quirk tKat makes 
my skin crawl when I find a 
place like Monica Apartments. 
A Human being should be all Hu- 
man. He should Have Habits and 
possessions peculiarly His own. 
He should not try to look like or 
to behave like anyone but Him- 
self. 

So tfiere I was, Gil tHe Arm, 
learning to eat witH my left Hand. 

An amputee never entirely loses 
what He’s lost. My missing fin- 
gers itched. I moved to keep from 
barking my missing elbow on 
sharp comers. I reached for 
things, then swore when they did 
not come. 

Owen Had Hung around, tKougH 
His own emergency funds must 
Have been running low. I Hadn’t 
offered to sell my third of tHe 
ship, and He Hadn’t asked. 

THE ORGANLEGGERS 



^'T^here Had been a girl. Now I’d 
forgotten Her name. One 
night I was at Her place waiting 
for Her to get dressed — a dinner 
date — and I’d Happened to see 
a nail file she’d left on a table. 
I’d picked it up. I’d almost tried 
to file my nails, but remembered 
in time. Irritated, I Had tossed 
the file back on the table — and 
missed. 

Like an idiot I’d tried to catcH 
it with my right Hand. 

And I’d caught it. 

I’d never suspected myself of 
Having psycHic powers. You Have 
to be in the right frame of mind 
to use a psi power. But wHo Had 
ever Had a better opportunity 
than I did that night, witK a 
whole section of brain tuned to 
the nerves and muscles of my 
right arm, and no right arm? 

I’d Held the nail file in my im- 
aginary Hand. I’d felt it, just as 
I’d felt my missing fingernails 
getting too long. I Had run my 
thumb along the rough steel sur- 
face; I Had turned the file in my 
fingers. Telekinesis for lift, esper 
for toucH. 

“That’s it,” Owen Bad said tKe 
next day. “Tfiat’s all we need. 
One crewman, and you witH your 
eldricH powers. You practice, see 
How strong you can get that lift. 
I’ll go find a sucker.” 

“He’ll Have to settle for a sixth 
of net. Cubes’ widow will want 
Her share.” 



131 



“Don’t worry. I’ll swing it.” 

“Don’t worry!” I’d waved a 
pencil stub at him. Even in Ceres’ 
gentte gravity, it was as much 
as I could lift — then. “You don’t 
think TK and esper can make do 
for a real arm, do you?” 

“It’s better than a real arm. 
You’ll see. You’ll be able to reach 
through your suit with it with- 
out losing pressure. What Belter 
can do that?” 

“Sure.” 

“What the hell do you want, 
GM? Someone should give you 
your arm back? You can’t have 
tiiat You lost it fair and square, 
through stupidity. Now it’s your 
choice. Do you fly with an im- 
aginary arm, or do you go back 
to Earth?” 

“I can’t go back. I don’t Have 
the fare.” 

“Well?” 

“Okay, okay. Go find us a 
crewman. Someone I can impress 
with my imaginary arm.” 

T sucked meditatively on a sec- 
ond Luau grog. By now all 
the booths were full, and a sec- 
ond layer was forming around 
the bar. The voices made a con- 
tinuous hypnotic uproar. Cock- 
taM hour had arrived. 

. He’d swung it, all right. 
On the strength of my imaginary 
arm, Owen had talked a kid 
named Homer Crandrasekhar 
into joining our crew. 

131 



He’d been right about my arm, 
too. 

Others with similar senses can 
reach further, up to halfway 
around the world. My unfortun^ 
ately literal imagination had re^ 
stricted me to a physic hand. But 
my esper fingertips were more 
sensitive, more dependable. I 
could lift more weight. Today, in 
Earth’s gravity, I can lift a full 
shot glass. 

I foimd I could reach through 
a cabin wall to feel for breaks 
in the circuits behind it. In vacu- 
um I could brush dust from the 
outside of my faceplate. In port 
I did magic tricks. 

I’d almost ceased to feel like 
a cripple. It was all due to Owen. 
In six months of mining I had 
paid off my hospital bills and 
earned my fare back to Earth', 
with a comfortable stake left over. 

“Finagle’s Black Humor!” 
Owen had exploded when I told 
him. “Of all places, why Earth?” 

“Because if I can get my UN 
citizenship back. Earth will re- 
place my arm. Free.” 

“Oh. That’s true,” he’d said 
dubiously. 

The belt had organ banks too, 
but they were always imdersup- 
plied. Belters didn’t give things 
away. Neither did the Belt gov- 
ernment. They kept the prices on 
transplants as high as they would 
go. Thus they dropped the de- 
mand to meet the supply, and 

GALAXY 



tfiat kept taxes down, to boot. 

In the Belt I’d have had to 
buy my own arm. And I didn’t 
Have the money. On Earth there 
was social security and a vast 
pupply of transplant material. 

What Owen had said couldn’t 
be done, I’d done. I’d found 
someone to hand me my arm 
back. 

Sometimes I’d wondered if 
Owen held the choice against me. 
He’d never said anything, but 
Homer Chandrasekhar had spo- 
ken at length. A Belter would 
Have earned his arm or done 
without. Never would he have 
accepted charity. 

Was that why Owen Hadn’t 
tried to call me? 

I shook my head. I didn’t be- 
lieve it. 

'^he room continued to lurch 
^ after my head stopped shak- 
ing. I’d had enough for the mo- 
ment. I finished my third grog 
and ordered dinner. 

Dinner sobered me for the next 
lap. It was something of a shock 
to realize that I’d run through 
the entire lifespan of my friend- 
ship with Owen Jennison. I’d 
known him for three years, 
though it had seemed like half a 
lifetime. And it was. Half my 
six-year lifespan as a Belter. 

I ordered coffee grog and 
watched the man pour it: Hot, 
milky coffee laced with cinnamon 
THE ORGANLEGGERS 



and other spices, and High-proof 
rum poured in a stream of blue 
fire. This was one of the special 
drinks served by a Human Head- 
waiter, and it was the reason 
they kept him around. Phase two 
of the ceremonial drunk: blow 
half your fortune, in the grand 
manner. 

But I called Ordaz before I 
touched the drink. 

“I won’t keep you long. Have 
you found out ans^thing new?” 
Ordaz took a closer look at my 
phone image. His disapproval 
was plain. “I see that you Have 
been drinking. Perhaps you 
should go home now, and call me 
tomorrow.” 

I was shocked. “Don’t you 
know anything about Belt cus- 
toms?” 

“I do not understand.” 

I explained the ceremonial 
drunk. “Look, Ordaz, if you know 
that little about the way a Belter 
thinks, then we’d better Have a 
talk. Soon. Otherwise you’re like- 
ly to miss something.” 

“You may be right. I can see 
you at noon, over lunch.” 

“Good. What Have you got?” 
“Considerable, but none of it 
is very helpful. Your friend land- 
ed on Earth two months ago, ar- 
riving on the Pillar of Fire, op- 
erating out of Outback Field, 
Australia. He was wearing a 
haircut in the style of Earth. 
From there — ” 



133 



Ct'^hat’s funny. He’d have had 
* to wait two months for His 
hair to grow out.” 

“That occurred even to me. I 
understand that a Belter com- 
monly shaves his entire scalp, ex- 
cept for a strip two inches wide 
running from the nape of His 
neck forward.” 

“The strip cut, yah. It prob- 
ably started when someone decid- 
ed he’s live longer if his Hair 
couldn’t fall in his eyes during 
a tricky landing. But Owen could 
have let his hair grow out dur- 
ing a singleship mining trip. 
Tha:e’d be nobody to see.” 

Still, it seems odd. Did you 
know that Mr. Jennison Had a 
cousin on Earth? One Harvey 
Peele, who manages a chain of 
supermarkets.” 

“So I wasn’t his next of kin, 
even on Earth.” 

“Mr. Jennison made no at- 
tempt to contact him.” 
“Ansdhing else? 

“I’ve spoken to the man who 
sold Mr. Jennison his droud and 
plug. Kenneth Graham owns an 
office and operating room on 
Gayley in Near West Los An- 
geles. Graham claims that the 
droud was a standard type, that 
your friend must have altered it 
himself.” 

“Do you believe him?” 

“For the present. His permits 
and his records are all in order. 
The droud was altered with a 

134 



soldering iron, just an amateur’s 
tool.” 

“uh huh.” 

“As far as the police are con- 
cerned, the case will probably be 
closed when we locate the tools 
Mr. Jennison used.” 

“Tell you what. I’ll wire Ho- 
mer Chandrasekhar tomorrow. 
Maybe He can find out things — 
why Owen landed without a strip 
haircut, why he came to Earth 
at all.” 

Ordaz shrugged with his eye- 
brows. He thanked me for my 
trouble and Hiuig up. 

The coffee grog was still hot. 
I gulped at it, savoring the sug- 
ary, bittery sting of it, trying to 
forget Owen dead and remember 
him in life. He was always slight- 
ly chubby, I remembered, but He 
never gained a pound and he nev- 
er lost a pound. He could move 
like a whippet when he had to. 

And now he was terribly thin, 
and his death-grin was ripe with 
obscene joy. 

I ordered another coffee grog. 
The waiter, a showman, made 
sure he had my attention before 
he lit the heated nun, then pour- 
ed from a foot above the glass. 
You can’t drink that drink slow- 
ly. It slides down too easily, and 
there’s the added spur that if you 
wait too long it might get cold. 
Rum and strong coffee. Two of 
these and I’d be drunkenly alert 
for hours. 



GALAXY 



l^^idnigHt found 

TVTarcjf^ar mnnir 



me in tHe 
Mars bar, running on Scotdi 
and soda. In between I’d been bar- 
hopping Irish coffee at Bergin’s, 
cold and smoking concoctions at 
the Moon Pool, Scotdi and wild 
music at Beyond. I couldn’t get 
drunk, and I couldn’t find the 
right mood. There was a barrier 
to the picture I was trying to re- 
build. 

It was the memory of the last 
Owen, grinning in an armchair 
with a wire leading down into his 
brain. 

I didn’t know that Owen. I liad 
never met the man, and never 
would have wanted to. From bar 
to night club to restaurant I had 
run from the image, waiting for 
.the alcohol to break the barri- 
er between present and past. 

So I sat at a comer table, sur- 
rounded by 3D panoramic views 
of an impossible Mars. Crystal 
towers and long, straight blue 
canals, six-legged beasts and 
beautiful, impossibly slender men 
and women, looked out at me 
across never-never land. Would 
Owen have found it sad or fun- 
ny? He’d seen the real Mars, and 
had not been impressed. 

I had reached that stage where 
time becomes discontinuous, 
where gaps of seconds or minutes 
appear between the events you 
can remember. Somewhere in that 
136 



period I found myself staring at 
a cigarette. I must Have just light- 
ed it, because it was near its orig- 
inal two - himdred - millimeter 
length. Maybe a waiter had snuck 
up behind me. There it was, at, 
any rate, burning between my 
middle and index fingers. 

I stared at the coal as the mood 
settled on me. I was calm, I was 
drifting, I was lost in time . 

"IT^e’d been two months in the 
' ' rocks, our first trip out 
since the accident. Back we came 
to Ceres with a holdful of gold, 
fifty percent pure, guaranteed 
suitable for rustproof wiring and 
conductor plates. At nightfall we 
were ready to celebrate. 

We walked along the city lim- 
its, with neon blinking and beck- 
oning on the right, a melted 
rock cliff to the left, and stars 
blazing through the dome over- 
head. Homer Chandrasekhar was 
practically snorting. On this night 
his first trip out culminated in 
his first homecoming; and home- 
coming is the best part. 

“We’ll want to split up about 
midnight,” he said. He didn’t 
need to enlarge on that. Three 
men in company might conceiv- 
ably be three singleship pilots, 
but chances are they’re a ship’s 
crew. They don’t have their sin- 
gleship licenses yet; they’re too 
stupid or too inexperienced. If we 
wanted companions — 



GALAXY 



“You haven’t thought this 
through,” Owen answered. I saw 
Homer’s double-take, then his 
quick look at where my shoulder 
ended, and I was ashamed. I did 
not need my crewmates to hold 
my hand, and in this state I’d 
only slow them down. 

Before I could open my mouth 
to protest, Owen went on. “Think 
it through. We’ve got a draw here 
that we’d be idiots to throw away. 
Gil, pick up a cigarette. No, not 
with your left hand. 

T was drunk gloriously drunk 
and feeling immortal. The at- 
tenuated Martians seemed to 
move in the walls, the walls that 
seemed to be picture windows on 
a Mars that never was. For the 
first time that night, I raised my 
glass in toast. 

“To Owen, from Gil the Arm. 
Thanks.” 

I transferred the cigarette to 
my imaginary hand. 

By now you’ve got the idea I 
was holding it in my imaginary 
fingers. Most people have the 
same impression, but it isn’t so. 
I held it clutched ignominiously 
in my fist. The coal couldn’t 
bum me, of course, but it still 
felt like a lead ingot. 

I rested my imaginary elbow 
on the table, and that seemed to 
make it easier — which is ridicu- 
lous, but it works. Truly, I’d ex- 
pected my imaginary arm to dis- 
THE ORGANLEGGERS 



appear after I got the transplant. 
But I’d found I could dissociate 
from the new arm, to hold small 
objects in my invisible hand, to 
feel tactile sensations in my in- 
visible fingertips. 

I’d earned the title Gil lEe 
Arm that night in Ceres. It Had 
started with a floating cigarette. 
Owen had been right. Everyone 
in the place eventually wound up 
staring at the floating cigarette 
smoked by the one-armed man. 
All I had to do was find the pret- 
tiest girl in the room with my 
peripheral vision, then catch her 
eye. 

That night we had been the 
center of the biggest impromptu 
party ever thrown in Ceres Base. 
It wasn’t planned that way at 
all. I’d used the cigarette trick 
three times, so that each of us 
would have a date. But the third 
girl already had an escort, and 
he was celebrating something; 
he’d sold some kind of patent to 
an Earth-based industrial firm. 
He was throwing money around 
like confetti. So we let him stay. 
I did tricks, reaching esper fin- 
gers into a closed box to tell what 
was inside; and by the time I fin- 
ished, all the tables had been 
pushed together and I was in the 
center, with Homer and Owen 
and three girls. Then we got to 
singing old songs, and the bar- 
tenders joined us, and suddenly 
everything was on the house. 

137 



Eventually about twenty of us 
wound up in the orbiting man- 
sion of the First Speaker for the 
Belt Government. The goldskin 
cops had tried to bust us up ear- 
lier, and the First Speaker had 
behaved very rudely indeed, then 
compensated by inviting them to 
join us . 

And that was why I used TK 
on so many cigarettes. 

Across the width of the Mars 
Bar, a girl in a peach colored 
dress sat studying me with her 
chin on her fist. I got up and 
went over. 

A yr y head felt fine. It was the 
first thing I checked when 
I woke up. Apparently I’d re- 
membered to take a hangover 
pill. 

A leg was Hooked over my knee. 
It felt good, though the pressure 
had put my foot to sleep. Fra- 
grant dark hair spilled beneath 
my nose. I didn’t move. I didn’t 
want her to know I was awake. 

It’s damned embarrassing when 
you wake up with a girl and 
can’t remember her name. 

Well, let’s see. A peach dress 
neatly himg from a doorknob 
... I remembered a whole lot 
of traveling last night. The girl 
at the Mars Bar. A puppet show. 
Music of all kinds. I’d talked 
about Owen, and she’d steered me 
away from that because it de- 
pressed her. Then — 

133 



Hah! Taffy. Last name forgot- 
ten. 

“Morning,” I said. 

“Morning,” she said. “Don’t 
try to move, we’re Hooked to- 
gether ...” In the sober morn- 
ing light she was lovely. Long 
black hair, brown eyes, creamy 
untanned skin. To be lovely this 
early was a neat trick, and I told 
her so,, and she smiled. 

My lower leg was dead meat 
until it started to buzz with' re- 
newed circulation, and then I 
made faces imtil it calmed down. 
Taffy kept up a running chatter 
as we dressed. “That third hand 
is strange. I remember you hold- 
ing me with two strong arms and 
stroking the back of my neck 
with the third. Very nice. It re- 
minded me of a Fritz Leiber 
story.” 

“The Wanderer. The panther 
girl.” 

“Mm hmm. How many girls 
have you caught with that cig- 
arette trick?” 

“None as pretty as you.” 

“And how many girls have you 
told that to?” 

“Can’t remember. It always 
worked before. Maybe this time 
it’s for real.” 

We exchanged grins. A minute 
later I caught her frowning 
thoughtfully at the back of my 
neck. “Something wrong?” 

“I was just thinking. You real- 
ly crashed and biuned last night. 

GALAXY 



I Hope you don’t drink tKat mucH 
all the time.” 

“Why? You worried about 

me?” 

She blushed, then nodded. 

“I should have told you. In 
fact, I think I did, last night. 
I was on a ceremonial drunk. 
When a good friend dies it’s obli- 
gatory to get smashed.” 

T affy looked relieved. “I didn’t 
mean to get — ” 

“Personal? Why not. You’ve 
the right. Anyway, I like — ” 
I meant maternal types but I 
couldn’t say that. “People who 
worry about me.” 

Taffy touched her hair with 
some kind of complex comb. A 
few strokes snapped her Hair in- 
stantly into place. Static elec- 
tricity? 

“It was a good drunk,” I said. 
“Owen would have been proud. 
And that’s all the mourning I’ll 
do. One drunk and — ” I spread 
my hands. “Out.” 

“It’s not a bad way to go,” 
Taffy mused reflectively. “Cur- 
rent stimulus, I mean. I mean, 
if you’ve got to bow out — ” 
“Now drop that!” I don’t know 
how I got so angry so fast. Ghoul- 
thin and grinning in a reading 
chair, Owen’s corpse was suddenly 
vivid before me. I’d fought that 
image for too many hours. 
“Walking off a bridge is enough 
of a cop-out,” I snarled. “Dying 
for a month while current burns 
THE ORGANLEGGERS 



out your brain is nothing less 
than sickening.” 

Taffy was hurt and bewildered. 
“But your friend did it, didn’t 
he? You didn’t make him sound 
like a weakling.” 

“Nuts,” I heard myself say. 
“He didn’t do it. He was — ” 

J ust like that, I was sure. I 
I must have realized it while 
I was drunk or sleeping. Of 
course he hadn’t killed himself. 
That wasn’t Owen. And current 
addiction wasn’t Owen either. I 
made a dive for the phone. 

“Good morning, Mr. Hamil- 
ton.” Detective-Inspector Ordaz 
looked very fresH and neat this 
morning. I was suddenly aware 
that I hadn’t shaved. “I see you 
remembered to take your hang- 
over pills.” 

“Right. Ordaz, Has it occurred 
to you that Owen might have 
been murdered?” 

“Naturally. But it isn’t pos- 
sible.” 

“I think it might be. Suppose 
he — ” 

“Mr. Hamilton.” 

“Yah?” 

“We have an appointment for 
lunch. Shall we discuss it then? 
Meet me at Headquarters at 
twelve hundred.” 

“Okay. One thing you might 
take care of this morning. See 
if Owen registered for a nudist’s 
license.” 



139 



“Do you think he might have?” 
“Yah. I’ll tell you why at 
lunch.” 

“Very well.” 

“Don’t hang up. You said you 
had found the man who sold 
Owen his droud-and-plug. What 
was his name again?” 

“Kenneth Graham.” 

“That’s what I thought.” I 
hung up. “Sure,” I said to my- 
self. “Somebody killed him. And 
that means — yah. Yah.” I turn- 
ed around to get my shirt and 
found myself face to face with 
Taffy. I’d forgotten about her 
completely. 

She said, “Killed?” as if she’d 
never heard the word. 

“Yah. See, the whole setup de- 
pended on his not being able 
to — ” 

“No. Wait. I don’t really want 
to know about it.” 

She really didn’t. The very 
subject of a stranger’s death was 
making her sick to her stomach. 

“Okay. Look, I’m a ratfink not 
to at least offer you breakfast, 
but I’ve got to get on this right 
away. Can I call you a cab?” 
When the cab came I dropped 
a ten-mark coin in the slot and 
helped her in. I got her address 
before it took off. 

VI 

\ RM Headquarters hummed 
with early morning activity. 

140 



Hellos came my way, and I an- 
swered them without stopping to 
talk. Anything important would 
filter down to me eventually. 

As I passed Julie’s cubical I 
glanced in. She was hard at work, 
limply settled in. her contour 
couch, jotting notes with her eyes 
closed. 

Kenneth Graham. 

A hookup to the basement 
computer formed the greater part 
of my desk. Learning how to use 
it had taken me several months. 
I typed an order for coffee and 
doughnuts then: INFORMA- 

TION RETRIEVAL. KEN- 
NETH GRAHAM. LIMITED 
LICENSE SURGERY. GENER- 
AL LICENSE: DIRECT CUR- 
RENT STIMULUS EQUIP- 
MENT SALES. ADDRESS 
NEAR WEST LOS ANGELES. 

Tape chattered out of the slot 
an instant response, loop after 
loop of it curling on my desk. I 
didn’t need to read it to know I 
was right. 

New technologies create new 
customs, new laws, new eth- 
ics, new crimes. About half the 
activity of the United Nations 
Police, the ARM’s dealt with 
control of a crime that hadn’t 
existed a century ago. The crime 
of organlegging was the result 
of thousands of years of medical 
progress, of millions of lives self- 
lessly dedicated to the ideals of 
healing the sick. Progress had 

GALAXY 



brougKt tliese ideals to reality, 
and, as usual, had created new 
problems. 

1900 A.D. was tlie year Carl 
Landsteiner classified human 
blood into four types, giving pa- 
tients their first real chance to 
survive a transfusion. The tech- 
nology of transplants Had grown 
with the growing of the twentietK 
century. Whole blood, dry bone, 
skin, live kidneys, live Hearts 
could all be transferred from one 
body to anotHer. Donors Had 
saved tens of thousands of lives 
in that hundred years, by willing 
their bodies to medicine. 

But the number of donors was 
limited, and not many died in 
such a way that anything of 
value could be saved. 

'^He deluge Had come some- 
thing less than a Hundred 
years ago. One healthy donor 
(but of course there was no sucH 
animal) could save a dozen lives. 
Why, then, should a condemned 
ax murderer die to no purpose? 
First a few states, then most of 
the nations of the world Had 
passed new laws. Criminals con- 
demned to death must be execut- 
ed in a hospital, with surgeons to 
save as mucH as could be saved 
for the organ banks. 

The world’s billions wanted to 
live, and the organ banks were 
life itself. A man could live for- 
ever as long as the doctors could 
THE ORGANLEGGERS 



shove spare parts into him fast- 
er than his own parts wore out. 
But they could do that only as 
long as the world’s organ banks 
were stocked. 

A Hundred scattered move- 
ments to abolish the death pen- 
alty died silent, unpublicized 
deaths. Everybody gets sick 
sometime. 

And still there were shortages 
in the organ banks. Still patients 
died for the lack of parts to save 
them. The world’s legislators had 
responded to steady pressure 
from the world’s people. Death 
penalties were established for 
first, second and third degree 
murder. For assault with a dead- 
ly weapon. Then for a multitude 
of crimes: rape, fraud, embezzle- 
ment, having children without a 
license, four or more counts of 
false advertising. For nearly a 
century the trend had been grow- 
ing, as the world’s voting citizens 
acted to protect their right to live 
forever. 

Even now there weren’t enough 
transplants. A woman with kid- 
ney trouble might wait a year for 
a transplant: one healthy kidney 
to last the rest of her life. A thir- 
ty-five-year-old heart patient 
must live with a sound but for- 
ty-year-old heart. One lung, part 
of a liver, prosthetics that wore 
out too fast or weighed too much 
or did too little . there weren’t 
enough criminals. Not surprising- 

141 



ly, the death penalty was a de- 
terrent. People stopped commit- 
ting crimes rather than face the 
donor room of a hospital. 

For instant replacement of 
your ruined digestive system, for 
a young healthy heart, for a 
whole liver when you’d ruined 
yours with alcohol . you had 
to go to an organlegger. 

'^here are three aspects to the 
business of organlegging. 

One is the business of kidnap- 
murder. It’s risky. You can’t fill 
an organ bank by waiting for 
volunteers. Executing condemned 
criminals is a government mo- 
nopoly. So you go out and get 
your donors: on a crowded city 
slidewalk, in an air terminal, 
stranded on a freeway by a car 
with a busted capacitor , . any- 
where. 

The selling end of the business 
is just as dangerous, because even 
a deperately sick man sometimes 
has a conscience. He’ll buy his 
transplant, then go straight to the 
ARM’s, curing his sickness and 
his conscience by turning in the 
whole gang. Thus the sales end 
is somewhat anonymous; but as 
there .are few repeat sales, that 
hardly matters. 

Third is the technical, medi- 
cal aspect. Probably this is the 
safest part of the business. Your 
hospital is big, but you can put it 
anywhere. You wait for the don- 
142 



ors, who arrive still alive; you 
ship out livers and glands and 
square feet of live skin, correctly 
labeled for rejection reactions. 

It’s not as easy as it sounds. 
You need doctors. Good ones. 

That was where Loren came in. 
He had a monopoly. 

Where did he get them? We 
were still trying to find out. 
Somehow, one man had discover- 
ed a foolproof way to recruit tal- 
ented but dishonest doctors prac- 
tically en masse. Was it really 
one man? All our sources said it 
was. And he had half the North 
American west coast in the palm 
of his hand. 

Loren. No holographs, no fin- 
gerprints or retina prints, not even 
a description. All we had was that 
one name, and a few possible 
contacts. 

One of these was Kenneth 
Graham. 

#"T^he holograph was a good one. 

Probably it had been posed 
in a portrait shop. Kenneth Gra- 
ham had a long Scottish face with 
a lantern jaw and a small, dour 
mouth. In the holo he was try- 
ing to smile and look dignified 
simultaneously. He only looked 
uncomfortable. His hair was 
sandy and close cut. Above his 
light gray eyes his eyebrows were 
so light as to be nearly invisible. 

My breakfast arrived. I dunk- 
ed a doughnut and bit it, and 

GALAXY 



found out I was hungrier than I’d 
thought. 

A string of holos had been re- 
produced on the computer tape. 
I ran through the others fairly 
quickly, eating with’ one hand 
and flipping the key with the 
other. Some were fuzzy, they had 
been taken by spy beams through 
the windows of Graham’s shop. 
None of the prints were in any 
way incrirninating. Not one show- 
ed Graham smiling. 

He had been selling electrical 
joy for twelve years now. 

A current addict has an ad- 
vantage over his supplier. Elec- 
tricity is cheap. With a drug, 
your supplier can always raise 
the price on you; but not with 
electricity. You see the ecstasy 
merchant once, when he sells you 
your operation and your droud, 
and never again. Nobody gets 
hooked by accident. There’s an 
honesty to current addiction. The 
customer always knows just what 
he’s getting into, and what it 
will do for him — and to him. 

Still, you’d need a certain lack 
of empathy to make a living the 
way Kenneth Graham did. Else 
he’d have had to turn away his 
customers. Nobody becomes a 
current addict gradually. He de- 
cides all at once, and he busre the 
operation before he has ever tast- 
ed its joy. 

Each one of Kenneth Gra- 
ham’s customers had reached his 
THE ORGANLEGGERS 



shop after deciding to drop out 
of the human race. 

What a stream of the Hopeless 
and the desperate must Have 
passed through Graham’s shop! 
How could they help but haunt 
his dreams? And if Kenneth Gra- 
ham slept well at night, then — 

Then, small wonder if he had 
turned organlegger. 

He was in a good position for 
it. Despair is characteristic of the 
would-be current addict. The un- 
known, the unloved, the people 
nobody knew and nobody needed 
and nobody missed, these passed 
in, a steady stream through Ken- 
neth Graham’s shop. 

So a few didn’t come out. Who 
would notice? 

T flipped quickly through the 
tape to find out who was in 
charge of watching Graham. 
Jackson Bera. I called down 
through the desk phone. 

“Sure,” said Bera, “we’ve had 
a spy beam on him about three 
weeks now. It’s a waste of good 
salaried ARM agents. Maybe He 
is clean. Maybe he’s been tipped.” 

“Then why not stop watching 
him?” 

Bera looked disgusted. “Be- 
cause we’ve only been watching 
for three weeks. How many don- 
ors do you think he needs a 
year? Two. Read the reports. 
Gross profit on a single donor is 
over a million UN marks. Gra- 

143 



Ham can afford to be careful who 
he picks.” 

“Yah.” 

“At that, He wasn’t careful 
enough. At least two of His cus- 
tomers disappeared last year. 
Customers with’ families. That’s 
what put us on him.” 

“So you could watch Kim for 
the next six months without a 
guarantee. He could be just wait- 
ing for the right guy to walk in.” 
“Sure. He has to write up a 
report on every customer. That 
gives him the right to ask per- 
sonal questions. If the guy has 
relatives, Graham lets him walk 
out. Most people do have rela- 
tives, you know. Then again,” 
Bera said disconsolately, “he 
could be clean. Sometimes a cur- 
rent addict disappears without 
help.” 

“How come I didn’t see any 
holos of Graham at Home? You 
can’t be watching just Kis shop.” 
Jackson Bera scratched his 
hair. He Had Kair like black steel 
wool, worn long like a bushman’s 
mop. “Sure we’re watching his 
place, but we can’t get a spy 
beam in there. It’s an inside 
apartment. No windows. You 
know anything about spy 
beams?” 

“Not much. I know they’ve 
been around a while.” 

“They’re as old as lasers. Old- 
est trick in the book is to put a 
mirror in the room you want to 
144 



bug. Then you run a laser beam 
through a window, or even 
through heavy drapes, and bounce 
it off the mirror. When you pick 
it up it’s been distorted by the 
vibrations in the glass. That gives 
you a perfect recording of any- 
thing that’s been said in that 
room. But for pictures you need 
something a little more sophisti- 
cated.” 

“How sophisticated can we 
get?” 

“We can put a spy beam in 
any room with a window. We can 
send one through some kinds of 
wall. Give us an optically flat 
surface and we can send one 
around corners.” 

“But you need an outside 
wall.” 

“Yup.” 

“What’s Graham doing now?” 

“Just a sec.” Bera disappeared 
from view. “Someone just came 
in. Bern’s talking to him. Want 
the picture?” 

“Sure. Leave it on. I’ll turn it 
off from here when I’m through 
with it.” 

VII 

'^he picture of Bera went dark. 

A moment later I was looking 
into a doctor’s office. If I’d seen it 
cold I’d have thought it was run 
by a podiatrist. There was the 
comfortable, tilt-back chair with 
the headrest and the footrest; 

GALAXY 



the cabinet next to it with in- 
stnunents lying on top, on a 
clean white cloth; the desk over 
in one comer. Kenneth Graham 
was talking to a homely, washed- 
out-looking girl. 

I listened to Graham’s would- 
be-fatherly reassurances and his 
glowing description of the magic 
of current addiction. When I 
couldn’t take it any longer, I 
turned the sound down. The girl 
took her place in the chair, and 
Graham placed something oveii 
her head. 

The girl’s homely face turned 
suddenly beautiful. 

Happiness is beautiful, all by 
itself. A happy person is beauti- 
ful, per se. Suddenly and totally, 
the girl was full of joy ^ — and I 
realized that I hadn’t known 
everything about droud sales. Ap- 
parently Graham had an induc- 
tor to put the current where he 
wanted it, without wires. He 
could show a customer what cur- 
rent addiction felt like, without 
first implanting the wires. 

What a powerful argument! 

Graham turned off the ma- 
chine. It was as if he’d turned 
off the girl. She sat stunned for 
a moment, then reached frantic- 
ally for her purse and started 
scrabbling inside. 

I couldn’t take any more. I 
turned it off. 

Small wonder if Graham had 
turned organlegger. He had to 

THE ORGANLEGGERS 



be totally without empathy just 
to sell his merchandise. 

Even there, I thought, he’d had 
a head start. 

So he was a little more callous 
than the rest of the world’s bil- 
lions. But not much. Every voter 
had a bit of the organlegger in 
him. In voting the death penalty 
for so many crimes, the lawmak- 
ers had only bent to pressure 
from the voters. There was a 
spreading lack of respect for life, 
the evil side of transplant tech- 
nology. The good side was no 
longer life for everyone. One 
condemned criminal could save 
a dozen deserving lives. Who 
could complain about that? 

W e hadn’t thought that way 
in the Belt. In the Belt 
survival was a virtue in itself, and 
life was a precious thing, spread 
so thin,' among the sterile rocks, 
hurtling in single units through 
all that killing emptiness between 
the worlds. 

So I’d had to come to Earth 
for my transplant. 

My request had been accepted 
two months after I landed. So 
quickly? Later I’d learned that 
the banks always have a surplus 
of certain items. Few people lose 
their arms these days. I had also 
learned, a year after the trans- 
plant had taken, that I was using 
an arm from a captured organ- 
legger’s storage tank. 



145 



TKat Had been a sHock. I’d 
Hoped my arm Had comci from a 
depraved murderer, someone 
wKo’d sKot fourteen nurses from 
a rooftop. Not at all. Some face- 
less, nameless victim Had Had tHe 
bad luck to encotinter a gKoul, 
and I Had benefitted tKereby. 

Did I turn in my new arm in 
a fit of revulsion? No, surprising 
to say, I did not. But I Had joined 
tHe ARM’s, once tHe Amalgama- 
tion of Regional Militia, now 
the United Nations Police. 
Though I Had stolen a dead 
man’s arm, I would Hunt the 
kin of those wHo Had killed him. 

The noble urgency of that re- 
solve had been drowned in paper- 
work these last few years. Per- 
haps I was becoming callous, like 
the flatlanders — the other flat- 
landers around me, voting new 
death penalties year after year. 
Income tax evasion. Operating a 
Hying vehicle on manual con- 
trols, over a city. 

Was Kenneth Graham so much 
worse than they? 

Sure he was. The bastard had 
put a wire in Owen Jennison’s 
head. 

T waited twenty minutes for 
Julie to come out. I could 
have sent her a memorandum, 
but there was plenty of time be- 
fore noon, and too little time to 
get anything accomplished, and 
... I wanted to talk to Her. 

146 



“Hi,” she said, taking the cof- 
fee. “Thanks. How went the cer- 
emonial drunk? Oh, I see. Mmm. 
Very good. Almost poetic.” Con- 
versation with Julie has a way 
of taking short cuts. 

Poetic, right. I remembered 
how inspiration had struck like 
lightning through a mild High 
glow. Owen’s floating cigarette 
lure. What better way to honor 
his memory than to use it to 
pick up a girl? 

“Right,” Julie agreed. “But 
there’s something jrou may Have 
missed. What’s Taffy’s last 
name?” 

“I can’t remember. She wrote 
it down on — ” 

“What does she do for a liv- 
ing?” 

“How should I know?” 

“What religion is she? Is she 
a pro or an anti? Where did she 
grow up?” 

“Damnit — ” 

“Half an Hour ago you were 
very complacently musing on 
how depersonalized all us flat- 
landers are except you. What’s 
Taffy, a person or a fold-out?” 
Julie stood with Her Hands on Her 
hips looking like a schoolteacher. 

How many people is Julie? 
Some of us have never seen this 
Guardian aspect. She’s frighten- 
ing, the Guardian. If it ever ap- 
peared on a date, the man she 
was with would be struck impo- 
tent forever. 



GALAXY 



It never does. When a repri- 
mand is deserved, Julie delivers 
it in broad daylight. This serves 
to separate Her functions, but it 
doesn’t make it easier to take. 

No use pretending it wasn’t Her 
business, either. 

I’d come Here to ask for Julie’s 
protection. Let me turn rmlovable 
to Julie, even a little bit un- 
lovable, and as far as Julie was 
concerned I would have an un- 
readable mind. How, then, would 
she know when I was in trouble? 
How could she send Help to res- 
cue me from whatever? My pri- 
vate life was her business, her sin- 
gle, vastly: important job. 

“I like Taffy,” I protested. “I 
didn’t care who she was when 
we met. Now I like her, and I 
think she likes me. What do you 
want from a first date?” 

“You know better. You can 
remember other dates when two 
of you talked all night on a 
couch, just from the joy of learn- 
ing about each other.” She men- 
tioned three names, and I flush- 
ed. Julie knows the words that 
will turn you inside out in an 
instant. “Taffy is a person, not 
an episode, not a symbol of any- 
thing, not just a pleasant night. 
What’s your judgment of her?” 

T thought about it, standing 
there in the corridor. Funny, 
I’ve faced the Guardian Julie on 
other occasions, and it has never 
THE ORGANLEGGERS 



occurred to me to just walk out 
of the unpleasant situation. Later 
I think of that. At the time I just 
stand there, facing the Guardian/ 
Judge/Teacher. I thought about 
Taffy ... 

“She’s nice,” I said. “Not de- 
personalized. Squeamish, even. 
She wouldn’t make a good nurse. 
She’d want to help too much, and 
it would tear her apart when she 
couldn’t. I’d say she was one of 
the vulnerable ones.” 

“Go on.” 

“I want to see Her again, but 
I won’t dare talk shop with her. 
In fact . I’d better not see her 
till this business of Owen is over. 
Loren might take an interest in 
her. Or . she might take an 
interest in me, and I might get 
hurt . have I missed any- 
thing?” 

“I think so. You owe Her a 
phone call. If you won’t be dat- 
ing her for a few days, call her 
and tell Her so.” 

“Check.” I spun on my heel, 
spun back. “Finagle’s Jest! I al- 
most forgot. The reason I came 
here — ” 

“I know, you want a time slot. 
Suppose I check on you at oh 
nine forty-five every morning?” 

“That’s a little early. When I 
get in deadly danger it’s usually 
at night.” 

“I’m off at night. OH nine for- 
ty-five is all I’ve got. I’m sorry, 
Gil, but it is.” 



147 



“Sold. Nine forty-five.” 

“Good. Let me know if you 
get real proof Owen was murder- 
ed, I'll give you two slots. You’ll 
be m a little more concrete dan- 
ger then.” 

‘^ood.” 

“I love you. Yeep, I’m late.” 
Arid she dodged back into her 
offk^, while I went to call Taffy. 

^T'affy wasn’t home, of course, 
and I didn’t know where 
shje worked, or even what she 
did. Her phone offered to take a 
message. I gave my name and 
said I’d call back. 

And then I sat there sweating 
for five minutes. 

It was half an hour to noon. 
Here I was at my desk phone. 
I couldn’t decently see any way 
to argue myself out of sending 
a message to Homer Chandrasek- 
har. 

I didn’t want to talk to Him, 
then or ever. He’d chewed me out 
but good, last time I’d seen him. 
My free arm had cost me my 
Belter life, and it had cost me 
Homer’s respect. I didn’t want 
to talk to him, even on a one- 
way message, and I most particu- 
larly didn’t want to have to tell 
him Owen was dead. 

But someone had to tell him. 

And maybe he could find out 
something. 

And I’d put it off nearly a 
full day. 

148 



For five minutes I sweated, and 
then I called Long Distance and 
recorded a message and sent it 
off to Ceres. More accurately, I 
recorded six messages before I 
was satisfied. I don’t want to talk 
about it. 

I tried Taffy again; sfie might 
come home for lunch. Wrong. 

I hung up wondering if Julie 
had been fair. What had we bar- 
gained for, Taffy and I, beyond a 
pleasant night? And we’d had 
that and would have others, 
with luck. 

But Julie would find it hard 
not to be fair. If she thought 
Taffy was the vulnerable type, 
she’d taken her information from 
my own mind. 

Mixed feelings. You’re a kid, 
and your mother has just laid 
down the law. But it is a law, 
something you can count on . ^ 
and she is paying attention to 
you . and she does care . • 
when, for so many of those out- 
side, nobody cares at all. 

VIII 

ttXJaturally I thought of mur- 
der,” said Ordaz. “I al- 
ways consider murder. When my 
sainted mother passed away after 
three years of the most tender 
care by my sister Maria Angela, 
I actually considered searching 
for evidence of needle holes 
about the head.”

“Find anything unusual?” 
Ordaz’s face froze. He put down 
his beer and started to get up. 

“Cool it,” I said hurriedly. “No 
offense intended.” He glared a 
moment, then sat down, half mol- 
lified. 

We’d picked an outdoor res- 
taurant on the pedestrian level. 
On the other side of a hedge (a 
real live hedge, green and grow- 
ing and everything) the shoppers 
were carried past in a steady, 
one-way stream. Beyond them, a 
slidewalk carried a similar 
stream in the opposite direction. 
I had the dizzy feeling that it 
was we who were moving. 

A waiter like a bell-bottomed 
chess pawn produced steaming 
dishes of chili from its torso, put 
them precisely in front of us and 
slid away on a cushion of air. 

“Naturally I considered mur- 
der. Believe me, Mr. Hamilton, 
it does not hold up.” 

“I think I could make a pretty 
good case.” 

“You may try, of course. Bet- 
ter, I will start you on your way. 
First, we must assume that Ken- 
neth Graham the happiness ped- 
dler,did not sell a droud-and-plug 
to Owen Jennison. Rather, Owen 
Jennison was forced to undergo 
the operation. Graham’s records, 
including the written permission 
to operate, were forged. All this 
we must assume, is it not so?” 
“Right. And before you tell me 
THE ORGANLEGGERS 



Graham’s escutcheon is unblem- 
ished, let me tell you that it 
isn’t.” 

“Oh?” 

“He’s connected with an organ- 
legging gang. That’s classified 
information. We’re watching him, 
and we don’t want him tipped.” 
“That is news.” Ordaz rubbed 
his jaw. “Organlegging. Well. 
What would Owen Jennison have 
to do with organlegging?” 
“Owen’s a Belter. The Belt’s 
always drastically short of trans- 
plant materials.” 

“Yes, they import quantities of 
medical supplies from Earth. Not 
only organs in storage, but also 
drugs and prosthetics. So?” 

“Owen ran a good many car- 
goes past the goldskins in his day. 
He got caught a few times, but 
he’s still way ahead of the govern- 
ment. He’s on the records as a 
successful smuggler. If a big or- 
ganlegger wanted to expand his 
market, he might very well send 
a feeler out to a Belter with a 
successful smuggling record.” 

CtX/ou never mentioned that 
Mr. Jennison was a smug- 
gler.” 

“What for? All Belters are 
smugglers, if they think they can 
get away with it. To a Belter, 
smuggling isn’t immoral. But an 
organlegger wouldn’t know that. 
He’d think Owen was already a 
criminal.”

“Da you think your friend — ” 
Ordaz hesitated delicately. 

“No, Owen wouldn’t turn or- 
ganlegger. But he might, he just 
might try to turn one in. The re- 
wards for information leading 
to the capture and conviction of, 
et cetera, are substantial. If some- 
one contacted Owen, Owen might 
very well have tried to trace the 
contact by himself. 

“Now, the gang, we’re after 
covers half the west coast of this 
continent. That’s big. It’s the 
Loren gang, the one Graham may 
be working for. Suppose Owen 
had a chance to meet Loren him- 
self?” 

“You think he might take it, 
do you?” 

“I think he did. I think he let 
his hair grow out so he’d look 
like an Earthman, to convince 
Loren he wanted to look incon- 
spicuous. I think he collected as 
much information as he could, 
then tried to get out with a whole 
skin. But he didn’t make it. 

“Did you find his application 
for a nudist license?” 

“No. I saw your point there,” 
said Ordaz. He leaned back, ig- 
noring the food in front of him. 
“Mr. Jennison’s tan was uni- 
form except for the characteristic 
darkening of the face. I presume 
he was a practicing nudist in the 
Belt” 

“Yah. We don’t need licenses 
there. He’d have been one here, 
150 



too, unless he was hiding some- 
thing. Remember that scar. He 
never missed a chance to show it 
off.” 

“Could he really have thought 
to pass for a — ” Ordaz hesi- 
tated. “A flatlander?” 

“With that Belter tan? No! He 
was overdoing it a little with the 
haircut. Maybe he thought Loren 
would underestimate him. But 
he wasn’t advertising his pres- 
ence, or he wouldn’t have left his 
most personal possessions home.” 
“So he was dealing with organ- 
leggers, and they found him out 
before he could reach you. Yes, 
Mr. Hamilton, this is well thought 
out. But it won’t work.” 

“Why not? I’m not trying to 
prove it’s murder. Not yet. I’m 
just trying to show you that mur- 
der is at least as likely as suicide.” 
“But it’s not, Mr. Hamilton.” 

looked at the question. 
“Consider the details of the hy- 
pothetical murder. Owen Jenni- 
son is drugged, no doubt, and 
taken to the office of Kenneth 
Graham. There, an ecstasy plug 
is attached. A standard droud is 
fitted and is then amateurishly 
altered with soldering tools. Al- 
ready we see, on the part of the 
killer, a minute attention to de- 
tails. We see it again in Kenneth 
Graham’s forged papers of per- 
mission to operate. They were 
impeccable. 



GALAXY 



“Owen Jennison is then taken 
back to his apartment. It would 
be his own, would it not? There 
would be little point in moving 
Kim to another. The cord from 
■his droud is shortened, again in 
amateurish fashion. Mr. Jenni- 
son is tied up — ” 

“I wondered if you’d see that.” 
“But why should he not be 
tied up? He is tied up and al- 
lowed to waken. Perhaps the ar- 
rangement is explained to him, 
perhaps not. That would be up 
to the killer. The killer then 
plugs Mr. Jennison into a wall. 
A current trickles through his 
brain, and Owen Jennison knows 
pure pleasure for the first time 
in his life. 

“He is left tied up for, let us 
say, three hours. In the first few 
minutes Ke would be a hopeless 
addict, I think — ” 

“You must have known more 
current addicts than I have.” 
“Even I would not want to be 
pinned down. Your normal cur- 
rent addict is an addict after a 
few minutes. But then, your 
normal current addict asked to 
be made an addict, knowing wHat 
it would do to his life. Current 
addiction is symptomatic of de- 
spair. Your friend might have 
been able to fight free of a few 
minutes’ exposure.” 

“So they kept him tied up for 
three hours. Then they cut the 
ropes.” I felt sickened. Ordaz’s 
THE ORGANLEGGERS 



ugly, ugly picture matched mine 
in every detail. 

“No more than three hours, 
by our hypothesis. They would 
not dare stay longer than a few 
hours. They would cut the ropes 
and leave Owen Jennison to 
starve to death. In the space of 
a month the evidence of his drug- 
ging would vanish, as would any 
abrasions left by ropes, lumps 
on his head, mercy needle punc- 
tures, and the like. A carefully 
detailed, well thought out plan, 
don’t you agree?” 

T told myself that Ordaz was not 
being ghoulish. He was just 
doing His job. Still, it was diffi- 
cult to answer objectively. 

“It fits our picture of Loren. 
He’s been very careful with us. 
He’d love carefully detailed, well 
thought out plans.” 

Ordaz leaned forward. “But 
don’t you see? A carefully de- 
tailed plan is all wrong. There 
is a crucial flaw in it. Suppose 
Mr. Jennison pulls out the 
droud?” 

“Could he do that? Would he?” 
“Could Ke? Certainly. A simple 
tug of the fingers. The current 
wouldn’t interfere with motor co- 
ordination. Would he?” Ordaz 
pulled meditatively at Kis beer. 
“I know a good deal about cur- 
rent addiction, but I don’t know 
what it feels like, Mr. Hamilton. 
Your normal addict pulls his 

151 



droud out as often as he inserts 
it, but your friend was getting 
ten times normal current He 
might have pulled the droud out 
a dozen times and instantly 
plugged it back each time. Yet 
Belters are supposed to be strong- 
willed men, very individualistic. 
Who knows whether, even after 
a week of addiction, your friend 
might not Have pulled the droud 
loose, coiled the cord, slipped it 
in his pocket, and walked away 
scot free? 

“There is an individual risk 
that someone might walk in on 
him — an automachinery serv- 
ice man, for instance. Or some- 
one might notice that he had not 
bought any food in a month'. A 
suicide would take that risk. Sui- 
cides routinely leave themselves 
a chance to change their minds. 
But a murderer? 

“No. Even if the chance were 
one in a thousand, the man who 
created such a detailed plan 
would never have taken such a 
chance.” 

The sun burned hotly down 
on our shoulders. Ordaz sudden- 
ly remembered his lunch and 
began to eat. 

I watched the world ride by 
beyond the hedge. Pedestrians 
stood in little conversational 
bunches; others peered into shop 
windows on the pedestrian strip, 
or glanced over the hedge to 
watch us eat. There were the 
152 



few who pushed through the 
crowd with set expressions, im- 
patient with the ten-mile-per- 
hoiur speed of the slidewalk. 

“Maybe they were watching 
him. Maybe the room was bug- 
ged.” 

“We searched the room thor- 
oughly,” said Ordaz. “If there 
had been observational equip- 
ment, we would have found it.” 
“It could have been removed.” 
Ordaz shrugged. 

I remembered the spy-eyes in 
Monica Apartments. Someone 
would have had to physically 
enter the room to carry a bug 
out. He could ruin it with the 
right signal, maybe, but it would 
surely leave traces. 

And Owen had had an inside 
room. No spy-eyes. 

“There’s one thing you’ve left 
out,” I said presently. 

“And what would that be?” 
“My name in Owen’s wallet, 
listed as next of kin. He was di- 
recting my attention to the thing 
I was working on. The Loren 
gang.” 

“That is possible.” 

“You can’t have it both’ ways.” 
Ordaz lowered his fork. “I can 
have it both ways, Mr. Hamil- 
ton. But you won’t like it.” 

“I’m sure I won’t.” 

“Let us incorporate your as- 
sumption. Mr. Jennison was con- 
tacted by an agent of Loren, the 

GALAXY 



organlegger, who intended to sell 
transplant material to Belters. He 
accepted. The promise of riches 
was too much for him. 

“A month later, something 
made him realize what a terrible 
thing he had done. He decided 
to die. He went to an ecstasy 
peddler and he had a wire put 
in his head. Later, before he 
plugged in the droud, he made 
one attempt to atone for his 
crime. He listed you as his next 
of kin, so that you might guess 
why he had died, and perhaps so 
that you could use that knowl- 
edge against Loren.” 

Ordaz looked at me across the 
table. “I see that you will never 
agree. I cannot help that. I can 
only read the evidence.” 

“Me too. But I knew Owen. 
He’d never have worked for an 
organlegger, he’d never have kill- 
ed himself, and if he had, he’d 
never have done it that way.” 
Ordaz didn’t answer. 

“What about fingerprints?” 

“In the apartment? None.” 
“None but Owen’s?” 

“Even his were found only on 
the chair and end tables. I curse 
the man who invented the clean- 
ing robot. Every smooth surface 
in that apartment was cleaned 
exactly forty-four times during 
Mr. Jennison’s tenancy.” Ordaz 
went back to his chili. 

“Then try this. Assume for the 
moment that I’m right. Assume 
THE ORGANLEGGERS 



Owen was after Loren, and Lor- 
en got him. Owen knew He was 
doing something dangerous. He 
wouldn’t have wanted me to get 
onto Loren before he was ready. 
He wanted the reward for Him- 
self. But he might Have left me 
something, just in case. 

“Something in a locker some- 
where, an airport or spaceport 
locker. Evidence. Not under his 
own name, or mine either, be- 
cause I’m a known ARM. But — ” 

“Some name you both know.” 

“Right. Like Homer Chan- 
drasekhar. Or — we got it. Cubes 
Forsythe. Owen would have 
thought that was apt. Cubes is 
dead.” 

“We will look. You must un- 
derstand that it will not prove 
your case.” 

“Sure. Anything you find, 
Owen could have arranged in a 
fit of conscience. Screw that. Let 
me know what you get,” I said, 
and stood up and left. 

IX 

T rode the slidewalk, not caring 
-*■ where it was taking me. It 
would give me a chance to cool 
off. 

Could Ordaz be right? Could 
he? 

But the more I dug into Owen’s 
death, the worse it made Owen 
look. 

Therefore Ordaz was wrong. 

153 



Owen work for an organleg- 
ger? He’d rather have been a do- 
nor. 

Owen getting his kicks from a 
wall socket? He never even watch- 
ed tridee! 

Owen kill himself? No. If so, 
not that way. 

But even if I could Have swal- 
lowed all that . 

Owen Jennison, letting me know 
he’d worked with organleggers? 
Me, Gil the Arm Hamilton? Let 
me know that? 

The slidewalk rolled along, past 
restaurants and shopping cen- 
ters and churches and banks. Ten 
stories below, the hum of cars 
and scooters drifted faintly up 
from the vehicular level. The sky 
was a narrow, vivid slash of blue 
between shadows of skyscrapers. 

Let me know that? Never. 

“But Ordaz’s strangely incon- 
sistent murderer was no better. 

I thought of something even 
Ordaz had missed. Why would 
Loren dispose of Owen so elabor- 
ately? Owen need only disap- 
pear into the organ banks, never 
to bother Loren again. 

The shops were thinning out 
now, and so were the crowds. The 
slidewalk narrowed, entered a 
residential area, and not a very 
good one. I’d let it carry me a 
long way. I looked around, try- 
ing to decide where I was. 

And I was four blocks from 
Graham’s place. 

154 



My subconscious had done me 
dirty. I wanted a look at Ken- 
neth Graham, face to face. The 
temptation to go on was nearly 
irresistible, but I fought it off 
and changed direction at the next 
disc. 

A slidewalk intersection is a 
rotating disc, its rim tangent to 
four slidewalks and moving with 
the same speed. From the center 
you ride up an escalator and over 
the slidewalks to reach stationary 
walks along the buildings. I could 
have caught a cab at the center 
of the disc, but I still wanted to 
think, so I just rode halfway 
around the rim. 

T could have walked into Gra- 
ham’s shop and gotten away 
with it. Maybe. I’d have looked 
hopeless and bored and hesitant, 
told Graham I wanted an ec- 
stasy plug, worried loudly about 
what my wife and friends would 
say, then changed my mind at 
the last moment. He’d have let 
me walk out, knowing I’d be 
missed. Maybe. 

But Loren had to know more 
about the ARM’s then we knew 
about him. Some time or other, 
had Graham been shown a holo 
of yours truly? Let a known 
ARM walk into his shop, and 
Graham would panic. It wasn’t 
worth the risk. 

Then, damnit, what could I 
do? 



GALAXY 



Ordaz’s inconsistent killer. If 
we assumed Owen was murdered, 
we couldn’t get away from 
tKe assumptions. The case, the 
nitpicking detail — and then 
Owen left alone to pull out the 
plug and walk away, or to be 
discovered by a persistent sales- 
man or a burglar, or — 

No. Ordaz’s hypothetical killer, 
and mine, would have watched 
Owen like a hawk. For a month. 

That did it. I stepped off at the 
next disc and got a taxi. 

The taxi dropped me on the roof 
of Monica Apartments. I took an 
elevator to the lobby. 

If the manager was surprised 
to see me, he didn’t show it as he 
gestured me into his office. The 
office seemed much roomier; than 
the lobby had, possibly because 
there were things to break the 
anonymous modern decor: paint- 
ings on the wall, a small black 
worm-track in the rug that must 
have been caused by a visitor’s 
cigarette, a holo of Miller and 
his wife on the wide, nearly 
empty desk. He waited until I 
was settled, then leaned forward 
expectantly. 

“I’m here on ARM’s business,” 
I said, and passed him my ident. 

He passed it back without 
checking it. “I presume it’s the 
same business,” he said. 

“Yah. I’m convinced Owen 
Jennison must have had visitors 
while he was here.”' 

THE ORGANLEGGERS 



The manager smiled. “That’s 
ridic — impossible.” 

“Nope, it’s not. Your holo 
cameras take pictures of visitors, 
but they don’t snap the tenants, 
do they?” 

“Of course not.” 

“Then Owen could have been 
visited by any tenant in the 
building.” 

^■T^He manager looked shocked. 

“No, certainly not. Really, 
I don’t see why you pursure this, 
Mr. Hamilton. If Mr. Jennison 
had been found in such a condi- 
tion, it would have been report- 
ed!” 

“I don’t think so. Could he 
Have been visited by any tenant 
in the building?” 

“No. No. The cameras would 
have taken a picture of anyone 
from another floor.” 

“How about someone from the 
same floor?” 

Reluctantly the manager bob- 
bed his head. “Ye-es. As far as 
the holo cameras are concerned, 
that’s possible. But — ” 

“Then I’d like to ask for pic- 
tures of any tenant who lived 
on the eighteenth floor during 
the last six weeks. Send them to 
the ARM’s Building, Central LA, 
Can do?” 

“Of course. You’ll have them 
within an hour.” 

“Good. Now, something else 
occurred to me. Suppose a man 

155 



got out on the nineteenth floor 
and walked down to the eigh- 
teenth,. He’d be holoed on the 
nineteenth, but not on the eigh- 
teenth, right?" 

The manager smiled indulgent- 
ly. “Mr. Hamilton, there are no 
stairs in this building.” 

“Just the elevators? Isn’t that 
dangerous?” 

“Not at all. There is a separate 
self-contained emergency power 
source for each of the elevators. 
It’s common practice. After all, 
v;ho would want to walk up eigh- 
ty stories if the elevator failed?” 
“Okay, fine. One last point. 
Could someone tamper with the 
computer? Could someone make 
it decide not to take a certain 
picture, for instance?” 

“I . , . am not an expert on 
how to tamper with computers, 
Mr. Hamilton. Why don’t you go 
straight to the company? Caul- 
field Brains, Inc.” 

“Okay. What’s your model?” 
“Just a moment.” He got up 
and leafed through a drawer in 
a filing cabinet. “EQ 144.” 
“Okay.” 

That was all I could do here, 
and I knew it . and still I 
didn’t have the will to get up. 
There ought to be something . 

Finally Miller cleared his 
throat. “Will that be all, sir?” 
“Yes,” I said. “No. Can I get 
into 1809?” 

“I’ll see if we’ve rented it yet.” 
156 



“The police are through with 
it?” 

“Certainly.” He went back to 
the filing cabinet. “No. It’s still 
available. I’ll take you up. How 
long will you be?” 

“I don’t know. No more than 
half an hour. No need to come 
up.” 

“Very well.” He handed me the 
key and waited for me to leave. 

^"T^he merest flicker of blue light 
caught my eye as I left the 
elevator. I would have thought it 
was my optic nerve, not in the 
real world, if I hadn’t known 
about the holo cameras. Maybe 
it was. You don’t need laser light 
to make a holograph, but it does 
get you clearer pictures. 

Owen’s room was a box. Ev- 
erything was retracted. There 
was nothing but the bare walls. 
I had never seen anything so des- 
olate, unless it was some asteroi- 
dal rock, too poor to mine, too 
badly placed to be worth' a base. 

The control panel was just be- 
side the door. I turned on the 
lights, then touched the master 
button. Lines appeared, outlined 
in red and green and blue. A 
great square on one wall for the 
bed, most of another wall for the 
kitchen, various outlines across 
the floor. Very handy. You would 
not want a guest to be standing 
on the table when you expanded 
it. 



GALAXY 



I’d come here to get the feel of 
the place, to encourage a hunch, 
to see if I’d missed anything. 
Translation: I was playing. Play- 
ing, I reached through the control 
panel to find the circuits. The 
printed circuitry was too small 
and too detailed to tell me any- 
thing, but I ran imaginary fin- 
gertips along a few wires and 
found that they looped straight 
to their action points, no detours. 
No sensors to the outside. You 
would have to be in the room to 
know what was expanded, what 
retracted. 

So a supposedly occupied room 
had had its bed retracted for six 
weeks. But you’d have to be in 
the room to know it. 

I pushed buttons to expand the 
kitchen nook and the reading 
chair. The wall slid out eight 
feet; the floor humped itself and 
took form. I sat down in the 
chair, and the kitchen nook 
blocked my view of the door. 

Nobody could have seen Owen 
from the hall. 

If only someone had noticed 
that Owen wasn’t ordering food. 

. That might have saved him. 

I thought of something else, 
and it made me look around for 
the air conditioner. There was a 
grill at floor level. I felt behind it 
with my imaginary hand. Some 
of these apartment air-condition- 
ing units go on when the CO^ 
level hits half a percent. This one 
158 



was geared to temperature and 
manual control. 

With the other kind, our care- 
ful killer could have tapped the 
air conditioner to find out if 
Owen was still alive and present. 
As it was, 1809 had behaved like 
an empty room for six weeks. 

T flopped back in the reading 
chair. 

If my hypothetical killer had 
watched Owen, he’d done it with 
a bug. Unless he actually lived on 
this floor for the four or five 
weeks it took Owen to die, there 
was no other way. 

Okay, think about a bug. Make 
it small enough and nobody 
would find it except the cleaning 
robot, who would send it straight 
to the incinerator. You’d have to 
make it big, so the robot would 
not get it. No worry about Owen 
finding it! And then, when you 
knew Owen was dead, you’d use 
the self-destruct. 

But if you burned it to slag, 
you’d leave a bum hole some- 
where. Ordaz would have found 
it. So. An asbestos pad? You’d 
want the self-destruct to leave 
something that the cleaning ro- 
bot would sweep up. 

And if you’ll believe that you 
will believe anything. It was too 
chancy. Nobody knows what a 
cleaning robot will decide is gar- 
bage. They’re made stupid be- 
cause it’s cheaper. So they’re 

GALAXY 



programmed to leave large ob- 
jects alone. 

There had to be someone on 
this floor, either to watch Owen 
Himself or to pick up the bug 
that did the watching. I was bet- 
ting everything I had on a human 
watcKer, 

I’d come Here mainly to give 
iny intuition a chance. It wasn’t 
working. Owen Had spent six 
weeks in tHis chair, and for at 
least the last week He’d been 
dead. Yet I couldn’t feel it witK 
Him. It was just a cHair witH two 
end tables. He had left nothing in 
the room, not even a restless 
ghost. 

The call caught me halfway 
back to Headquarters. 

“You were right,” Ordaz told 
me over the wristphone. “We 
Have found a locker at Death 
Valley Port registered to Cubes 
Forsythe. I am on my way there 
now. Will you join me?” 

“I’ll meet you there.” 

“Good. I am as eager as you 
to see what Owen Jennison left 
us.” 

I doubted that. 

The Port was something more 
than two hundred and thirty 
miles away, an Hour at taxi 
speeds. It would be a big fare. I 
typed out a new address on the 
destination board, then called in 
at Headquarters. An ARM agent 
is fairly free; he doesn’t Have to 
justify every little move. There 
THE ORGANLEGGERS 



was no question of getting per- 
mission to go. At worst they 
might disallow the fare on my 
expense account. 

“Oh, and there’ll be a set of 
holos coming in from Monica 
Apartments,” I told the man. 
“Have the computer check them 
against known organleggers and 
associates of Loren.” 

The taxi rose smoothly into 
the sky and headed east. I watch- 
ed tridee and drank coffee until 
I ran out of coins for the dis- 
penser.

Tf you go between November 
and May, when the climate 
is ideal. Death Valley can be a 
tourist’s paradise. There is the 
Devil’s Golf Course, with its fan-

Zabriskie Point and its weird bad-

mining sites; and all kinds of 
strange, rare plants, adapted to

someday I was going to go see

was the spaceport. But the Port

and fusion reaction motors Have 
left blast pits striped like rain- 
bows by esoteric, often radio-ac- 
tive salts. But mostly tKe field 
retains its ancient glare white. 

And out across the salt are 
ships of many sizes and many 
shapes. Vehicles and machinery 
dance attendance, and if you’re 
willing to wait, you may see a 
ship land. It’s worth the wait. 

The Port building, at the edge 
of the major salt flat, is a pastel 
green tower set in a wide patch 
of fluorescent orange concrete. No 
ship has ever landed on it — yet. 
TKe taxi dropped me at the en- 
trance and moved away to join 
others of its kind. And I stood 
inhaling the dry, balmy air. 

Four months of the year. Death 
Valley’s climate is ideal. One Au- 
gust the Furnace Creek Ranch re- 
corded 134° F. shade tempera- 
ture. 

A man behind the desk told me 
that Ordaz had arrived before me. 
I found him and another officer 
in a labyrinth of pay lockers, each 
big enough to Hold two or three 
suitcases. The locker Ordaz had 
opened held only a lightweight 
plastic briefcase. 

“He may Have taken other 
lockers,” he said. 

“Probably not. Belters travel 
light. Have you tried to open it?” 

“Not yet. It i§ a combination 
160 



lock. I thought perhaps ^ ” 

“Maybe.” I squatted to look at 
it. 

Funny. I felt no surprise at all. 
It was as if I’d known all along 
that Owen’s suitcase would be 
here. And why not? He was bound 
to try to protect himself some- 
how. Through me, because I wag 
already involved in the UN side 
of organlegging. By leaving some- 
thing in a spaceport locker, be- 
cause Loren couldn’t find the 
right locker or get into it if Ke 
did, and because I would natural- 
ly connect Owen with spaceports. 
Under Cubes’s name, because I’d 
be looking for that, and Loren 
wouldn’t. 

Hindsight is wonderful. 

The lock had five digits. He 
must have meant me to open it. 
Let’s see ...” and I moved the 
tumblers to 42217. April 22, 2117, 
the day Cubes died, stapled sud- 
denly to a plastic partition. 

The lock clicked open. 

Ordaz went instantly for the 
manila folder. More slowly, I 
picked up two glass phials. One 
was tightly sealed against Earth’s 
air and half full of an incredibly 
fine dust. So fine was it that it 
slid like oil inside the glass. TKe 
other phial Held a blackened grain 
of nickel-iron, barely big enough 
to see. 

zither things were in that case, 
but the prize was that folder. 

GALAXY 



TKe story was in tKere ... at 
least up to a point. Owen must 
have planned to add to it. 

A message had been waiting 
for him in the Ceres mail dump 
when he returned from his last 
trip out. Owen must have laughed ‘ 
over parts of that message. Loren 
had taken the trouble to assem- 
ble a complete dossier of Owen’s 
smuggling activities bver the past 
eight years. Did he think he 
could ensure Owen’s silence by 
threatening to turn the dossier 
over to the goldskins? 

Maybe the dossier had given 
Owen the wrong idea. In any 
case, he’d decided to contact Lor- 
en and see what developed. Or- 
dinarily he’d have sent me the 
entire message and let me try to 
track it down. I was the expert, 
after all. But Owen’s last trip out 
had been a disaster. 

His fusion drive had blown 
somewhere beyond Jupiter’s or- 
bit. No explanation. The safeties 
had blown his lifesystem capsule 
free of the explosion, barely. A 
rescue ship had returned him to 
Ceres. The fee had nearly broken 
him. He needed money. Loren 
may have known that and count- 
ed on it. 

The reward for information 
leading to Loren’s capture would 
have bought him a new ship. 

He’d landed at Outback Field, 
following Loren’s instructions. 
From there, Loren’s men had 
THE ORGANLEGGERS 



moved him about a good deal : to 
London, to Bombay, to Amberg, 
Germany. Owen’s personal, writ- 
ten story ended in Amberg. How 
had he reached California? He 
had not had a chance to say. 

But in between, he had learned 
a good deal. There were snatches 
of detail on Loren’s organization. 
There was Loren’s full plan for 
shipping illicit transplant materi- 
als to the Belt, and for finding 
and contacting customers. Owen 
had made suggestions there. Most 
of them sounded reasonable and 
would be workable in practice. 
T57pically Owen. I could find no 
sign that he’d overplayed his 
hand. 

But of course Ee Eadn’t known 
it when he did. 

And there were Eolos, twenty- 
three of them, each a member of 
Loren’s gang. Some of the pic- 
tures had markings on the back; 
others were blank. Owen had 
been unable to find out where 
each of them stood in the organi- 
zation. 

I leafed through them twice, 
wondering if one of them could 
be Loren himself. Owen had nev- 
er known. 

tCTt would seem you were 
right,” said Ordaz. “He 
could not have collected such 
detail by accident. He must have 
planned from the beginning to 
betray the Loren gang.” 



161 



“Just as I told you. And fie 
was murdered for it.” 

“It seems fie must fiavfe been. 
Wfiat motive could fie fiave h’ad 
for suicide?” Ordaz’s round, calm 
face was doing its best to sKow 
anger. “I find I cannot believe in 
our inconsistent murderer eitfier. 
You fiave ruined my digestion, 
Mr. Hamilton.” 

I told film my idea about otH- 
er tenants on Owen’s floor. He 
smiled and nodded. “Possibly, 
possibly, Tfiis is your department 
now. Organlegging is tfie business 
of tfie ARM’s.” 

“Rigfit.” I closed tfie briefcase 
and fiefted it. “Let’s see wfiat 
tfie computer can do witfi tfiese. 
I’ll send you pfiotocopies of ev- 
erything in fiere.” 

“You’ll let me know about tfie 
other tenants?” 

“Of course.” 

I walked into ARM Head- 
quarters swinging that precious 
briefcase, feeling on top of tfie 
world. Owen had been murdered. 
He had died witfi honor, if not — 
oli, definitely not — witfi dignity. 
Even Ordaz knew it now. 

Then Jackson Bera, snarling 
and panting, went by at a dead 
run. 

“What’s up?” I called after 
him. Maybe I wanted a cKance 
to brag. I fiad twenty-tfiree faces, 
twenty-three organleggers, in my 
briefcase. 

Bera slid to a stop beside me. 
162 



“WKere in hell Have you been?” 

“Working. Honest. What’s tfie 
hurry?” 

“Remember that pleasure ped- 
dler we were watching?” 

“Graham? Kenneth Graham?” 

“That’s tfie one. He’s dead. 
We blew it.” And Bera took off. 

T Te’d reached tfie lafi By tfie 
■^■^time I caught up witfi him. 
Kennetfi Graham’s corpse was 
face up on tfie operating table< 
His long, lantern-jawed face was 
pale and slack, without expres- 
sion, empty. Machinery was in 
place above and below fiis fiead. 

“How you doing?” Bera de- 
manded. 

“Not good,” tfie doctor answer- 
ed. “Not your fault. You got fiim 
into tfie deepfreeze fast enougfi. 
It’s just that tfie current — ” fie 
shrugged. 

I shook Bern’s shoulder. “Wfiat 
happened?” 

Bera was panting a little from 
fiis run. “Something must fiave 
leaked. Graham tried to make a 
run for it We got him at tfie air- 
port.” 

“You could fiave waited. Put 
someone on tfie plane witfi fiim. 
Flooded tfie plane with TY-4. 

“Remember tfie stink tfie last 
time we used TY-4 on civilians? 
Damn newscasters.” Bera was 
sfiivering. I don’t blame fiim. 

ARM’s and organleggers play a 
funny kind of game. Tfie organ- 

GALAXY 



“Just look at his head.” 



leggers have to turn their donors 
in alive, so they’re always armed 
with hypo guns, firing slivers of 
crystaline anaesthetic that melt 
instantly in the blood. We use 
the same weapon, for somewhat 
the same reason; a criminal has 
to be saved for trial, and then for 
the government hospitals. So no 
ARM ever expects to kill a man. 

There was a day I learned the 
truth. A small-time organlegger 
named Raphael Haine was try- 
ing to reach a call button in His 
own home. If he’d reached it all 
kinds of hell would have broken 
loose, Haine’s men would have 
hypoed me, and I would have 
regained consciousness a piece at 
a time, in Haine’s organ storage 
tanks. So I strangled him. 

The report was in the compu- 
ter, but only three human beings 
knew about it. One was my im- 
mediate superior, Lucas Garner. 
The other was Julie. So far, he 
was the only man I’d ever killed. 

And Graham was Bern’s first 
killing. 

“We got him at the airport,” 
said Bera. “He was wearing a 
hat. I wish I’d noticed that, we 
might have moved faster. We 
started to close in on him with 
hypo guns. He turned and saw us. 
He reached under his hat, and 
then he fell.” 

“Killed himself?” 

“UH huh.” 

“How?” 

THE ORGANLEGGERS 



I edged closer to the table, try- 
ing to stay out of the doctor’s 
way. The doctor was going 
tiirougH the routine of trying to 
pull information from a dead 
brain by induction. It wasn’t go- 
ing well. 

There was a flat oblong box on 
top of Graham,’s Head. Black 
plastic, about Half tfie size of a 
pack of cards. I toucHed if and 
knew at once that it was attacKed 
to Graham’s skull. 

“A droud. Not a standard type. 
Too big.” 

“Uh. huh.” 

Liquid Helium ran up my 
nerves. “THere’s a battery in it.” 
“Right.” 

“Right.” 

“I often wonder wBat tfie vint- 
ners buy, et cetera, A cordless 
droud. Man, that wHat I want 
for Christmas.” 

Bera twitched all over. “Don’t 
say that.” 

“Did you know fie was a cur- 
rent addict?” 

“No. We were afraid to Hug His 
Home. He might Have found it 
and be tipped. Take another look 
at that thing.” 

The shape was wrong, I 
thought. The black plastic case 
had been Half melted. 

“Heat,” I mused. “OBI” 

“UH huH. He blew tfie wfiole 
battery at once. Sent tfie wfiole 

163 



killing charge right through his 
brain, right through the pleasure 
center of his brain. And Jesus, 
Gil, the thing I keep wondering 
is, what did it feel like? Gil, 
what could it possible have felt 
like?” 

I thumped him across the 
shoulders in lieu of giving him 
an intelligent answer. He’d be a 
long time wondering. And so 
would I. 

Here was the man who had 
put the wire in Owen’s head. Had 
his death been momentary hell, 
or all the delights of paradise in 
one singing jolt? Hell, I hoped, 
but I didn’t believe it. 

At least Kenneth Graham 
wasn’t somewhere else in the 
world, getting a new face and 
new retinae and new fingertips 
from Loren’s illicit organ banks. 

“Notiling,” said the doctor. 
“His brain’s too badly burned. 
iThere’s just nothing there that 
isn’t too scrambled to make 
sense.” 

“Keep trying,” said Bera. 

I left quietly. Maybe later I’d 
buy Bera a drink. He seemed 
to need it. Bera was one of those 
with empathy. I knew that he 
could almost feel that awful 
surge of ecstasy and defeat as 
Kenneth Graham left the world 
behind. 

The holos from Monica Apart- 
jnents had arrived hours ago. 
J64 



Miller had picked not only the 
tenants who had occupied the 
eighteenth floor during the past 
six weeks, but tenants from the 
nineteenth and seventeenth floors 
too. 

It seemed an embarrassment 
of riches. I toyed with the idea 
of someone from the nineteenth 
floor dropping over his balcony 
to the eighteenth, every day for 
five weeks. But 1809 hadn’t had 
an outside wall, let alone a win- 
dow, not to mention anything 
resembling a balcony. 

Had Miller played with the 
same idea? Nonsense. He didn’t 
even know the problem. He’d just 
overkilled with the holos to 
show how cooperative he was. 

None of the tenants during the 
period in question matched 
known or suspected Loren men. 

I said a few appropriate words 
and went for coffee. Then I re- 
membered the twenty-three pos- 
sible Loren men in Owen’s brief- 
case. 

I’d left them with a pro- 
grammer, since I wasn’t quite 
sure how to get them into the 
computer myself. He ought to 
be finished by now. 

I called down. He was. 

I persuaded the computer to 
compare them with the holos 
of the tenants from Monica 
Apartments. 

Nothing. Nobody matched 
anybody.

T spent tKe next two Sours writ- 
ing up tSe Owen Jennison 
case. A programmer would Save 
to translate it for tSe macKine. I 
wasn’t tKat good yet. 

We were back witS Ordaz’s in- 
consistent killer. 

TSat, and a tangle of dead 
ends. Owen’s deatH Sad bougSt 
us a handful of new pictures, pic- 
tures which might even be obso- 
lete by now. Organleggers chang- 
ed their faces at tSe drop of a 
hat. I finished the case outline, 
sent it down to a programmer, 
and called Julie. I wouldn’t need 
her protection now. 

Julie had left for Some. 

I started to call Taffy, stopped 
with her number Saif dialed. 
There are times not to make a 
phone call. I needed to sulk; I 
needed a cave to be alone in. My 
expression would probably have 
broken a phone screen. Why in- 
flict it on an innocent girl? 

I left for home. 

It was dark when I reached tSe 
street. I rode the pedestrian 
bridge across the slidewalks, 
waited for a taxi at the intersec- 
tion disc. Presently one dropped, 
the white FREE sign blinking 
on its belly. I stepped in and 
deposited my credit card. 

Owen had collected his Solos 
from all over the Eurasian con- 
tinent. Most of them, if not all, 
THE ORGANLEGGERS 



had been Loren’s foreign agents. 
Why had I expected to find them 
in Los Angeles? 

The taxi rose into the white 
night sky. City lights turned the 
cloud cover into a flat white 
dome. We penetrated the clouds, 
and stayed there. The taxi auto- 
pilot didn’t care if I had a view 
or not. 

... So what did I Save now? 
Someone among dozens of ten- 
ants was a Loren man. That, or 
Ordaz’s inconsistent killer, the 
careful one, had left Owen to die 
for five weeks, alone and unsu- 
pervised. 

. Was the inconsistent killer 
so unbelievable? 

He was, after all, my own hy- 
pothetical Loren. And Loren Sad 
committed murder, the ultimate 
crime. He’d murdered routinely, 
over and over, with fabulous prof- 
its. The ARM’s hadn’t been able 
to touch him. Wasn’t it about 
time he started getting careless? 

Like Graham. How long Sad 
Graham been selecting donors 
among his customers, choosing a 
few nonentities a year? And then, 
twice within a few months, he 
took clients who were missed. 
Careless. 

AT ost criminals are not too 
bright. Loren had brains 
enough; but the men on his pay- 
roll would be about average. 
Loren would deal with the stupid 

165 



ones, the ones who turned to 
crime because they didn’t have 
enough sense to make it in real 
life. 

If a man like Loren got care- 
less, this is how it would happen. 
Unconsciously he would judge 
ARM intelligence by his own 
men. Seduced by an ingenious 
plan for murder, he might ignore 
the single loophole and go 
through with it. With Graham to 
advise him, he knew more about 
current addiction than we did; 
perhaps enough to trust the ef- 
fects of current addiction on 
Owen. 

Then Owen’s killers had de- 
livered him to his apartment and 
never seen him again. It was a 
small gamble Loren had taken, 
and it had paid off, this time. 

Next time he’d grow more 
careless. One day we’d get him. 

But not today. 

The taxi settled out of the 
traffic pattern, touched down on 
the roof of my apartment build- 
ing in Hollywood Hills. I got 
out and moved toward the ele- 
vators. 

An elevator opened. Someone 
stepped out. 

Something warned me. Some- 
thing about the way he moved. I 
turned, quick-drawing from the 
shoulder. The taxi might have 
made good cover — if it hadn’t 
been already rising. Other figures 
had stepped from the shadows. 

166 



I think I got a couple before 
something stung my cheek. Mer- 
cy-bullets, slivers of crystaline 
anaesthetic melting in my blood- 
stream. My head spun, and the 
roof spim, and the centrifugal 
force dropped me limply to the 
room. Shadows loomed above me, 
then receded to infinity. 

l^ingers on my scalp shocked me 
awake. 

I woke standing upright, bound 
like a mummy in soft, swaddling 
bandages. I couldn’t so much as 
twitch a muscle below my neck. 
By the time I knew that much it 
was too late. The man behind me 
had finished removing the elec- 
trodes from my head and stepped 
into view, out of reach of my im- 
aginary arm. 

There was something of the 
bird about him. He was tall and 
slender, small-boned, and his tri- 
angular face reached a point at 
the chin. His wild, silken blond 
hair had withdrawn from his tem- 
ples, leaving a sharp widow’s 
peak. He wore impeccably tailor- 
ed wool street shorts in orange 
and brown stripes. Smiling 
brightly, with his arms folded and 
his head cocked to one side, he 
stood waiting for me to speak. 

And I recognized him. Owen 
Bad taken a holo of him. 

“Where am I?” I groaned, try- 
ing to sound groggy. “What time 
is it?” 



GALAXY 



“Time? It’s already morning,” 
said my captor. “As for wHere 
you are, I’ll let you wonder.” 

Sometfiing about Eis manner. 
... I took a guess and said, “Lor- 
en?” 

Loren bowed, not overdoing it. 
“And you are Gilbert Hamilton 
of the United Nations Police. Gil 
the Arm.” 

Had he said Arm or ARM? I 
let it pass. “I seem to have slip- 
ped.” 

“You underestimated the reacH 
of my own arm. You also under- 
estimated my interest. 

I Had. It isn’t mucK Earder to 
capture an ARM than any other 
citizen, if you catch’ him off 
guard, and if you’re willing to 
risk the men. In this case his risk 
Had cost him nothing. Cops use 
Hypo gims for the same reason 
organleggers do. Th’e men I’d 
shot, if I’d hit anyone in tEose 
few seconds of battle, would Have 
come around long ago. Loren 
must have set me up in these 
bandages, then left me under 
“Russian sleep” until He was 
ready to talk to me. 

The electrodes were the “Rus- 
sian sleep”. One goes on each 
eyelid, one on the nape of the 
neck. A small current goes 
througH the brain, putting you 
right to sleep. You get a full 
night’s sleep in an Hour. If it’s 
not turned off you can sleep for- 
ever. 

THE ORGANLEGGERS 



So this was Loren. At long last. 
He stood watching me with his 
Head cocked to one side, bird- 
like, witK his arms folded. One 
Hand Held a hypo gun, rather neg- 
ligently, I thought. 

What time was it? I didn’t 
dare ask again, because Loren 
might guess something. But if I 
could stall him until 0945, Julie 
could send Help . 

She could send Help wHere? 
Finagle in hysterics! Where was 
I? If I didn’t know that, Julie 
wouldn’t know either! 

And Loren intended me for 
the organ banks. One crystaline 
sliver would knock me out with- 
out harming any of tHe delicate, 
infinitely various parts that made 
me Gil Hamilton. That Loren’s 
doctors would take me apart. 

Tn government operating rooms 
they flasH-burn tHe criminal’s 
brain for later um burial. God 
knows what Loren would do with 
my own brain. But tHe rest of 
me was young and HealtKy. Even 
considering Loren’s overHead, I 
was worth more than a million 
UN marks on the Hoof. 

“Why me?” I asked. “It was 
me you wanted, not just any 
ARM. WKy the interest in me?“ 
“It was you who were investi- 
gating the case of Owen Jennison. 
Much too thoroughly.” 

“Not thoroughly enough, 
damnit!” 



167 



Loren looked puzzled. “You re- 
ally don’t understand?” 

“I really don’t.” 

“I find that highly interesting,” 
Loren mused. “Highly.” 

“All right, why am I still 
alive?” 

“I was curious, Mr. Hamilton. 
I hoped you’d tell me about your 
imaginary arm.” 

So he’d said Arm, not ARM. 
I bluffed anyway. “My what?” 
“No need for games, Mr. Ham- 
ilton. If I think I’m losing. I’ll 
use this.” He wiggled the hypo 
gun. “You’ll never wake up.” 
Damn! He knew. The only 
things I could move were my 
ears and my imaginary arm, and 
Loren knew all about it! I’d 
never be able to lure him into 
reach’. 

Provided He knew all about 
it. 

I had to draw him out. 
“Okay,” I said, ’’but I’d like 
to know how you found out about 
it. A plant in the ARM’s?” 

Loren chuckled. “I wish it were 
so. No. We captured one of your 
men some months ago, quite by 
accident. When I realized what 
he was, I induced him to talk 
shop with me. He was able to 
tell me something about your re- 
markable arm. I hope you’ll tell 
me more.” 

“Who was it?” 

“Really, Mr. Hamil — ” 

“Who was it?” 

16S 



“Do you really expect me to 
remember the name of every do- 
nor?” 

Who had gone into Loren’s or- 
gan banks? Stranger, acquain- 
tance, friend? Does the manager 
of a slaughterhouse remember ev- 
ery slaughtered steer? 

“So-called psychic powers in- 
terest me,” said Loren. “I remem- 
bered you. And then, when I was 
on the verge of concluding an 
agreement with your Belter friend 
Jennison, I remembered some- 
thing unusual about a crewman 
he had shipped with. They call- 
ed you Gil the Arm didn’t they? 
Prophetic. In port your drinks 
came free if you could use your 
imaginary arm to drink them?” 
“Then damn you. You thought 
Owen was a plant, did you? Be- 
cause of me! Me!” 

“Breast beating, will earn you 
nothing, Mr. Hamilton.” Lor- 
en put steel in his voice. “Enter- 
tain me, Mr. Hamilton.” 

T’d been feeling around for any- 
thing that might release me 
from my upright prison. No such 
luck. I was wrapped like a mum- 
my in bandages too strong to 
break. All I could feel with my 
imaginary hand were cloth band- 
ages up to my neck, and a brac- 
ing rod along my back to hold 
me upright. Beneath the swath- 
ing I was naked. 

“I’ll show you my eldrich pow- 
GALAXY 



ers,” I told Loren, “If you’ll loan 
me a cigarette.” Maybe that 
would draw him close enough . 

He knew something about my 
arm. He knew it’s reach. He put 
one single cigarette on the edge 
of a small table-on-wheels and 
slid it up to me. I picked it up 
and stuck it in my mouth! and 
waited hopefully for him to come 
light it. “My mistake,” he mur- 
mured; and he pulled the table 
back and repeated the whole 
thing with a lighted cigarette. 

No luck. At least I’d gotten my 
smoke. I pitched the dead one 
as far as it would go; about two 
feet. I had to move slowly with! 
my imaginary hand. Otherwise 
what I’m holding simply slips 
through my fingers. 

Loren watched in fascination. 
A floating, disembodied ciga- 
rette, obeying my will! His eyes 
held traces of awe and horror. 
That was bad. Maybe the ciga- 
rette had been a mistake. 

Some people see psi powers as 
akin to witchcraft, and psychic 
people as servants of Satan. If 
Loren feared me, then I was dead. 

“Interesting,” said Loren. “How 
far will it reach?” 

He knew that. “As far as my 
real arm, of course.” 

“But why? Others can reacH 
much further. ’Why not you?” 
He was clear across the room, 
a good ten yards away, sprawled 
in an armchair. One hand held a 
THE ORGANLEGGERS 



drink, the other held the hypo 
gun. He was superbly relaxed. I 
wondered if I’d ever see him 
move from that comfortable 
chair, much less come within 
reach. 

^"T^he room was small and bare, 
with the look of a basement. 
Loren’s chair and a small porta- 
ble bar were the only furnishings, 
unless there were others behind 
me. 

A basement could be anywhere. 
Anywhere in Los Angeles, or out 
of it. If it was really morning, 
I could be anywhere on Earth 
by now. 

“Sure,” I said, “others can 
reach farther than me. But they 
don’t have my strength. It’s an 
imaginary arm, sure enough, and 
my imagination won’t make it 
ten feet long. Maybe someone 
could convince me it was, if he 
tried hard enough. But maybe 
he’d ruin what belief I have. 
Then I’d have two arms, just 
like everyone else. I’m better 
off ...” I let it trail away be- 
cause Loren was going to take all 
my damn arms anyway. 

My cigarette was finished. I 
pitched it away. 

“Want a drink?” 

“Sure, if you’ve got a jigger 
glass. Otherwise I can’t lift it.” 

He found me a shot glass and 
sent it to me on the edge of the 
rolling table. I was barely strong 

16? 



enough to pick it up. Loren’s eyes 
never left me as I sipped and 
put it down. 

The old cigarette lure. Last 
night I’d used it to pick up a 
girl. Now it was keeping me alive. 

Did I really want to leave the 
world with something gripped 
tightly in my imaginary fist? 
Entertaining Loren. Holding his 
interest until — 

XII 

here was I? Where? 

And suddenly I knew. “We 
are at Monica Apartments,” I 
said. “Nowhere else.” 

“I knew you’d guess that even- 
tually.” Loren smiled. “But it’g 
too late. I got to you in time.” 
“Don’t be so damn complac- 
ent. It was stupidity, not your 
luck. I should have smelled it. 
Owen would never have come 
here of his own choice. You or- 
dered him here.” 

“And so I did. By then I al- 
ready knew he was a traitor.” 
“So you sent him here to die. 
Who was it that checked on him 
every day to see he’d stay put? 
Was it Miller, the manager? He 
has been working for you. He’s 
the one who took the holographs 
of you and your men out of the 
computer.” 

“He was the one,” said Lor- 
en. “But it wasn’t every day. I 
had a man watching Jennison 

170 



every second, through a portable 
camera. We took it out after he 
was dead.” 

“And then waited a week. Nice 
touch,” The wonder was that it 
had taken me so long. The at- 
mosphere of the place . what 
kind of people would live in Mon- 
ica Apartments? The faceless 
ones, the ones with no identity, 
the ones who would surely be 
missed by nobody. They would 
stay put in their apartments while 
Loren checked on them, to see 
that they really did have nobody 
to miss them. Those who quali- 
fied would disappear, and their 
papers and possessions with them, 
and their holo would vanish from 
the computer. 

Loren said, “I tried to sell or- 
gans to the Belters, through your 
friend Jennison. I know he be- 
trayed me, Hamilton. I want to 
know how badly.” 

“Badly enough.” He’d guess 
that. “We’ve got detailed plans 
for getting up an organ bank 
dispensary in the Belt. It would 
not have worked an3nvay, Lor- 
en. Belters don’t think that way.” 

“No pictures.” 

“No.” I didn’t want him chang- 
ing his face. 

“I was sure he’d left some- 
thing,” said Loren. “Otherwise we 
would have made him a donor. 
Much simpler. More profitable, 
too. I needed the money, Hamil- 
ton. Do you know what it costs 

GALAXY 




the organization to let a donor 
go?” 

“A million or so. Why’d you 
do it?” 

“He’d left something. There 
was no way to get at it. All we 
could do was try to keep the 
ARM’s from looking for it.” 

t C A h.“ I had it then. “When 
anyone disappears without 
a trace, the first thing an idiot 
thinks of is organleggers.” 

“Naturally. So he couldn’t just 
disappear, could he? The police 
would go to the ARM’s, the file 
would go to you, and you’d start 
looking.” 

“For a spaceport locker.” 

“Oh?” 

“Under the name of Cubes 
Forsythe.” 

“I knew that name,” Loren said 
between teeth. “I should have 
tried that. You know, after we 
had him hooked on current, we 
tried pulling the plug on him 
to get him to talk. It didn’t work. 
He couldn’t concentrate on any- 
thing but getting the droud back 
in his head. We looked high and 
low — ” 

“I’m going to kill you,” I said, 
and meant every word. 

Loren cocked his head, frown- 
ing. “On the contrary, Mr. Ham- 
ilton. Another cigarette?” 

“Yah.” 

He sent it to me, lighted, on 
the rolling table. I picked it up, 
THE ORGANLEGGERS 



holding it a trifle ostentatiously. 
Maybe I could focus his attention 
on it — on his only way to find 
my imaginary hand. 

Because if he kept his eyes on 
the cigarette, and I put it in my 
mouth at a crucial moment — 
I’d leave my hand free without 
his noticing. 

What crucial moment? He was 
still in the armchair. I had to 
fight the urge to coax him closer. 
Any move in that direction would 
make him suspicious. 

What time was it? And what 
was Julie doing? I thought of a 
night two weeks past. Remem- 
bered dinner on the balcony of 
the highest restaurant in Los An- 
geles, just a fraction less than a 
mile up. A carpet of neon that 
spread below us to touch the 
horizon in all directions. Maybe 
she’d pick it up . 

She’d be checking on me at 
0945. 

CCXTou must have made a re- 
markable spaceman,” said 
Loren. “Think of being the only 
man in the solar system who can 
adjust a hull antenna without 
leaving the cabin.” 

“Antennae take a little more 
muscle than I’ve got.” So he 
knew I could reach through 
things. If he’d seen that far — 
“I should have stayed,” I told 
Loren. “I wisli I were on a min- 
ing ship, right this minute. All I 

171 



wanted at the time was two good 
arms.” 

“Pity. Now you have three. 
Did it occur to you that using 
psi powers against men was a 
form of cheating?” 

“What?” 

“Remember Raphael Maine ?” 
Loren’s voice had become uneven. 
He was angry, and holding it 
down with difficulty. 

“Sure. Small time organlegger 
in Australia.” 

“Raphael Maine was a friend 
of mine. I know he had you tied 
up at one point. Tell me Mr. 
Hamilton : if your imaginary hand 
is as weak as you say, how did 
you untie the ropes?” 

“I didn’t. I couldn’t have. 
Maine used handcuffs. I picked 
his pocket for the key . witli 
my imaginary hand, of course.” 

“You used psi powers against 
him. You had no right!” 

Magic. Anyone who’s not psy- 
chic himself feels the same way, 
just a little. A touch of dread, a 
touch of envy. Loren thought he 
could handle ARM’s; he’d killed 
at least one of us. But to send 
warlocks against him was grossly 
unfair. 

That was why he’d let me wake 
up. Loren wanted to gloat. How 
many men have captured a war- 
lock? 

“Don’t be an idiot,” I said. “I 
didn’t volunteer to play your silly 
game, or Maine’s either. My rules 
172 



make you a wholesale murderer.” 
Loren got to his feet (what time 
was it?), and I suddenly realized 
my time was up. He was in a 
white rage. His silky blond hair 
seemed to stand on end. 

I looked into the tiny needle 
hole in tUe fiypo gun. There was 
nothing I coidd do. The reach of 
my TK was the reach of my fin- 
gers. I felt all the things I would 
never feel: the quart of Trastine 
in my blood to keep the water 
from freezing in my cells, the cold 
bath of half-frozen alcohol, the 
scalpels and the tiny, accurate 
surgical lasers. Most of all, the 
scalpels. 

A nd my knowledge would die 
when they threw away my 
brain. I knew what Loren look- 
ed like. I knew about Monica 
Apartments and who knew how 
many others of the same kind? 
I knew where to go to find all the 
loveliness in Death Valley, and 
someday I was going to go. What 
time was it? What time? 

Loren had raised the hypo gun 
and was sighting down the stiff 
length of his arm. Obviously he 
though he was at target practice. 
“It really is a pity,” he said, and 
there was only the slightest trem- 
or in his voice. “You should have 
stayed a spaceman.” 

What was he waiting for? “I 
can’t cringe unless you loosen 
these bandages,” I snapped, and 

GALAXY 



I jabbed what was left of my 
cigarette at him for emphasis. It 
jerked out of my grip, and I 
reached and caught it — 

And stuck it in my left eye. 

At another time I’d have exam- 
ined the idea a little more closely. 
But I’d still have done it. Loren 
already thought of me as his 
property. As live skin and healthy 
kidneys and lengths of artery, as 
parts in Loren’s organ banks, I 
was property worth a million UN 
marks. And I was destroying my 
eye! Organleggers arc always 
hurting for eyes; anyone who 
wears glasses could use a new 
pair, and the organleggers them- 
selves are constantly wanting to 
change retina prints. 

What I hadn’t anticipated was 
the pain. I’d read somewhere that 
there are no sensory nerves in the 
eyeball. Then it was my lids that 
hurt. Terribly! 

But I only had to hold on. 

T orcn swore and came for me 

' at a dead run. He knew how 
terribly weak was my imaginary 
arm. What could I do with it? He 
didn’t know; he’d never known, 
though it stared him in the face. 
He ran at me and slapped at the 
cigarette, a full swing that half 
knocked my head off my neck 
and sent the now dead butt rico- 
cheting off a wall. Panting, snarl- 
ing, speechless with! rage, he 
stood — within reach. 

THE ORGANLEGGERS 



My eye closed like a small tor- 
mented fist. 

I reached past Loren’s gun, 
through his chest wall, and found 
his heart. And squeezed. 

His eyes became very round, 
His mouth gaped wide, his larynx 
bobbed convulsively. There was 
time to fire the gun. Instead he 
clawed at his chest with a Half- 
paralyzed arm. Twice he raked 
his fingernails across his chest, 
gaping upward for air that would 
not come. He thought he was 
having a Heart attack. Then his 
rolling eyes found my face. 

My face. I was a one-eyed car- 
nivore, snarling with the will to 
murder. I would have his life if 
I had to tear the heart out of 
his chest! How could he help but 
know? 

He knew! 

He fired at the floor and fell. 

I was sweating and shaking 
with reaction and disgust. The 
scars! He was all scars; I’d felt 
them going in. His heart was a 
transplant. And the rest of him — 
he’d looked about thirty from a 
distance, but this close it was im- 
possible to tell. Parts were young- 
er, parts older. How much of 
Loren was Loren? What parts 
had he taken from others? And 
none of the parts quite matched. 

He must have been chronically 
ill, I thought. And the Board 
wouldn’t give him the transplants 
He needed. And one day he’d seen 

173 



the answer to all his problems . 

Loren wasn’t moving. He 
wasn’t breathing. I remembered 
the way his heart had jumped and 
wriggled in my imaginary hand, 
and then suddenly given up. 

He was lying on his left arm, 
hiding his watch. I was all alone 
in an empty room, and I still did 
not know what time it was. 

I never found out. It was hours 
before Miller finally dared to in- 
terrupt his boss. He stuck his 
round, blank face around the 
door jamb, saw Loren sprawled at 
my feet, and darted back with a 
squeak. A minute later a hypo 
gun came around the jamb, fol- 
lowed by a watery blue eye. I 
felt the sting in my cheek. 

tCT checked you early,” said 
-*■ Julie. She settled herself un- 
comfortably at the foot of the 
hospital bed. “Rather, you called 
me. When I came to work you 
weren’t there, and I wondered 
why, and wham. It was bad, 
wasn’t it?” 

“Pretty bad,” I said. 

“I’d never sensed anyone so 
scared.” 

“Well, don’t tell anyone about 
it.” I hit the switch to raise the 
bed to sitting position. “I’ve got 
an image to maintain.” 

My eye and the socket around 
it were bandaged and numb. 
There was no pain, but the numb- 
ness was obtrusive, a reminder 

174 



of two dead men who had become 
part of me. One arm, one eye. 

If Julie was feeling that with 
me, then small wonder if she was 
nervous. She was. She kept shift- 
ing and twisting on the bed. 

“I kept wondering what time it 
was. What time was it?” 

“About nine ten.” Julie shiver- 
ed. “I thought I’d faint when 
that — that vague little man 
pointed his hypo gun around the 
corner. Oh, don’t! Don’t, Gil. It’s 
over.” 

That close? Was it that close? 
“Look,” I said, “you go back to 
work. I appreciate the sick call, 
but this isn’t doing either of us 
any good. If we keep it up we’ll 
both wind up in a state of per- 
manent terror. 

She nodded jerkily and got up. 

“Thanks for coming. Thanks 
for saving my life, too.” 

Julie smiled from the doorway. 
“Thanks for the orchids.” 

I hadn’t ordered them yet. I 
flagged down a nurse and got hen 
to tell me that I could leave to- 
night, after dinner, provided I 
went straight home to bed. She 
brought me a phone, and I used 
it to order the orchids. 

Afterward I dropped the bed 
back and lay there a while. It 
was nice being alive. I began to 
remember promises I had made, 
promises I might never have kept. 
Perhaps it was time to keep a 
few. 



GALAXY 



I called down to Surveillance 
and got Jackson Bera. After let- 
ting him drag from me the story 
of my heroism, I invited him up 
to the infirmary for a drink. His 
bottle, but I’d pay. He didn’t 
like that part, but I bullied him 
into it. 

T had dialed half of Taffy’s num- 
ber before, as I had last 
night, I changed my mind. My 
wristphone was on the bedside 
table. No pictures. 

“ ’Lo.” 

“Taffy? This is Gil. Can you 
get a weekend free?” 

“Sure. Starting Friday?” 
“Good.” 

“Come for me at ten. Did you 
ever find out about your friend?” 
“Yah. I was right. Organleggers 
killed him. It’s over now, we got 
the guy in charge.” I didn’t 
mention the eye. By Friday the 
bandages would be off. “About 
that weekend. How would you 
like to see Death Valley?” 
“You’re kidding, right?” 

“I’m kidding, wrong. Listen — ” 
“But it’s hot! It’s dry! It’s as 
dead as the Moon! You did say 
Death Valley, didn’t you?” 



“It’s not hot this month. Lis- 
ten ...” And she did listen. She 
listened long enough to be con- 
vinced. 

“I’ve been thinking,” she said 
then. “If we’re going to see a lot 
of each other, we’d better make 
a — a bargain. No shop talk. All 
right?” 

“A good idea.” 

“The point is, I work in a hos- 
pital,” said Taffy. “Surgery. To 
me, organic transplant material is 
just the tools of my trade, tools 
to use in healing. It took me a 
long time to get that way. I don’t 
want to know where the stuff 
comes from, and I don’t want to 
know anything about organleg- 
gers.” 

“Okay, we’ve got a covenant. 
See you at ten hundred Friday.” 

A doctor, I thought afterward. 
Well. The weekend was going to 
be a good one. Surprising people 
are alwa 3 TS the ones most worth 
knowing. 

Bera came in with a pint of 
J8sB. “My treat,” he said. “No 
use arguing, ’cause you can’t 
reach your wallet anyway.” And 
the fight was on.

THE ORGANLEGGERS 175 



WELCOME, 

CENTAURIANS 



by TED THOMAS 



Sometimes people have more 
in common than they think. 



/Colonel Lee Musser looked af 
the tracery on tKe giant 
screen in front of him and said, 
“Someone seems to be attack- 
ing Russia. I’m glad it isn’t us.” 
He picked up the pKone and said, 
“Captain, this is Colonel Musser 
at Central. Listen carefully, time 
is important. We Have a large 
bogie at a high altitude — three 
hundred miles — on a southeast- 
erly course that will cut across 
the Russian heartland, destina- 
tion unknown. We didn’t put it 
there, but the Russians may 
think we did and retaliate. I’m 
recommending that both the 
Joint Chiefs and the hot line be 
used right now to tell tire Rus- 



sians we don’t know anything 
about it. I’ll stand by here for 
any confirmation you might 
need. Over and out.” 

He hung up and turned to su- 
pervise the swelling bustle of ac- 
tivity around him. Other phones 
were busy as other men called 
lesser officials. After making cer- 
tain that the information was be- 
ing passed around as fast as pos- 
sible he urged the tracking 
groups to fix a course and tar- 
get for the bogie. The computers 
ceased gathering data and swung 
to computation. Musser watched 
the trace on the screen until His 
phone rang, a long, continuous 
ring. He knew the origin of that 



176 



ring. He picked up the phone 
and said, “Colonel Musser, Sir.” 
He listened a moment and then 
swung around to the computer 
technicians and waved them 
over. He said, “Our data so far 
show it is not falling. It seems to 
be in orbit now, passing right 
over the center of the continent. 
It’s larger than anything we 
could put up, and you might 
point out that fact to them at the 
outset. Sir. They ought to know 
we couldn’t put anjrthing that 
big up. Neither could they, so it 
might be appropriate to ask 
them what the hell they . that 
is, what they are doing.” He lis- 
tened, and then, “Good luck. Sir.” 
and hung up. 

“Follow it,” he said to the 
computer technicians, “and let 
me know of any departure from 
its existing course.” 

Linton stepped up, a wiry, 
dapper army colonel who always 
leaned forward a bit when he 
walked. He kept his eye on the 
tracery on the screen as he talk- 
ed to Musser. “Well, Lee, a bit 
of action at last. Where’d that 
thing come from if not the Rus- 
sians? British, French, Chinese? 
None of them has the capabil- 
ity.” 

“You make the answer easy, if 
what you say is true. It comes 
from off -planet.” 

“Oh come on, Lee. Not you.” 

“That bogie’s real. We’ve been 

WELCOME CENTAURIANS 



triangulating it for six minutes 
from eighteen or more observers. 
What’s your answer?” 

Musser’s phone rang, the Pen- 
tagon ring this time. He picked 
it up and said, “Colonel Musser.” 
He listened. “Good,” he said. “It 
makes sense that they would 
know we didn’t do it. All pres- 
sure off, then? We’ll keep watch- 
ing it. Me? I think it is from off- 
planet. No, I’m not. Where else? 
Okay. So long, Charlie.” 

Linton winced. No one of such 
comparative youth as Musser 
called General Charles S. Arling- 
ton “Charlie.” Linton said, “You 
must be bucking for a promo- 
tion, or out. You a UFO nut?” 
He pronounced it you-foh. 

Musser said, “As of now I’m 
converted.” Linton wandered off, 
shaking his head. 

Activity settled into routine 
for an hour. The bogie changed 
orbit, dropping to one hundred 
miles and levelling, following a 
line above the parallel of forty 
degrees north latitude. The 
phones rang again, and for fif- 
teen minutes things were busy. 
For six hours thereafter there 
was no change, and by that time 
half the world had monitors of 
one kind or another on the bogie. 
Several of the giant telescopes 
had photographed it as it swept 
through their field of view, and 
nations were comparing pictures. 

Musser said, “I never thought 

177 



I’d see the day when we’d be 
swapping photographs with the 
Soviet Union on such a chummy 
basis. What’s become of all our 
good old nastiness?” 

The Pentagon ring came again, 
and it was the General. “Lee, it 
looks like your first guess was 
right. I want you to head up our 
effort in coping with it. Come on 
over here.” 

Tn his new office Musser felt 
uncomfortable for a few 
hours with no activity around 
him. Then the answers to some 
of his questions began to come 
in and the phones began to ring. 
He received approximate answers 
from half a dozen universities 
and research centers around the 
country before anyone else even 
thought to ask the questions. 
What was that slightly flatten- 
ed sphere made of? Did it leave 
a trail of any kind? What was its 
mass? What gravitational forces 
acted on it when it changed 
course? On and on he went, 
often putting the same question 
to different groups to compare 
answers. It wasn’t until the next 
day, however, that he thought to 
call in an etymologist and a lin- 
guist. “How do we communicate 
with them up there?” He waved 
his hand at the sky. 

They looked surprised and 
did not answer, so he said, “Can 
either of you think of anything 

178 



better than flashing a light at 
them in a sequence of one, two, 
three flashes, over and over, or 
perhaps up to ten?” 

The etymologist agreed, but 
thought that seven would be 
right. The linquist thought five 
would be better. While they 
mounted an argument with each 
other Musser had his men start 
up the great heliograph he had 
rigged to emit short flashes in 
bursts of one, two and three. 
They used the aiming mechanism 
on an antiaircraft rifle as the bo- 
gie swept overhead, and they 
maintained their flashes for four 
minutes. Musser said to his two 
experts, “Give some thought to 
what we’ll do when we make a 
little headway here. I want a rea- 
sonable plan, not a lot of argu- 
ments. Bye.” 

He turned to the task of set- 
ting up radio communication in 
conjunction with the flashes, and 
two passes later his men emitted 
blasts of static of mixed frequen- 
cies timed with the flashes. On 
the third orbit, a flash came back 
from the bogie and at the same 
time they received a pulse on 
the high end of their scatter band. 
By the sixth orbit the bogie was 
counting with him, and Musser 
was using his voice. He ordered 
his men to raise the frequency 
slowly to the TV broadcast 
ranges, and on the tenth orbit a 
master sergeant was giving the 

GALAXY 



bogie a lesson in the alphabet 
and simple English sentences. 
Musser got his first response on 
the twelfth orbit. It was an as- 
pirated word that sounded like 
the whispered word “Hhugg.” 
That was when the etymologist 
and the linguist showed up with 
a plan. Musser thanked them and 
asked them if they minded leav- 
ing so he could take a nap. Gen- 
eral Arlington woke him up. 

“Lee, I’m putting you in over- 
all charge of that thing, to the 
extent you can take charge of it.” 
General Arlington was known 
for a sense of humor. “It seems 
to be talking to your men at a 
pretty steady rate. One thing, 
though. Other countries have 
followed your lead. I understand 
the bogie now speaks pretty fair 
French, Russian, German and 
Japanese. What are you going 
to do?” 

Musser said, “Rub my eyes 
and yawn.” General Arlington 
frowned a little, and Musser said, 
“Okay, Charlie. The thing to do 
is to talk it down to the United 
Nations Plaza. Let’s see what 
I can do.” He stepped up to the 
battery of TV cameras and mi- 
crophones while the master ser- 
geant briefed him on every- 
thing that had been happening. 

“It knows who you are,” the 
sergeant said. “It wanted to 
know who thought of signalling 
so fast. So go and talk to it.” 

WELCOME CENTAURIANS 



“What do they look like, ser- 
geant?” 

“Well, they won’t show us. Or 
can’t. They say they can’t. But 
they can see us.” 

“They use names?” 

“No.” 

A yr usser walked out in front of 
-‘■’-‘•the cameras and said, “All 
right up there. Lee Musser down 
here. You see and Hear me all 
right?” 

An immediate sibilant “yesss” 
came back. 

“What do you Have in mind up 
there?” 

A pause, and then, “You come 
right to the point, Lee Musser 
We have nothing particular in 
mind. We’d like to come down 
for a few days, but we don’t know 
what we would be getting into. 
Will it be safe for us?” 

“I think so. I’ll check with all 
the other countries to make sure 
nobody takes a shot at you. I 
would like to have you come 
down here, but other countries 
might not like that. We have a 
place where all countries meet, 
and it is not far from Here. You 
ought to come down there.” 
“Damn good idea.” 

Musser glared at the sergeant. 
“Who taught it ‘damn?’ ” 

The sibilant voice said, “Oh we 
learned a lot from your television 
and radio once you taught us 
the language. Don’t blame the 

179 



sei^eant. We’ll ask the other 
countries whose language we 
speak if we can land safely at 
the U.N. Okay with you, Lee?” 

Musser shrugged and said, 
“Sure, man.” 

“We’re not men. Wait until 
you see us. Be back to you in a 
few minutes.” 

Musser nodded and walked 
out of camera view and started 
his people calling to clear with 
the New York City police, the 
New York City fire department, 
the mayor, the governor, the 
U.N. Secretary General, regional 
F.B.I. Early Warning Command- 
er, Air Force Commander, Har- 
bor Police, and the U.S. Coast 
Guard. He had just got the phone 
calls going when he heard the sib- 
ilant voice say, “Lee Musser, 
you there?” 

He stepped back into camera 
view and said, “I’m here, man. 
How’d you make out?” 

“Pretty good. Can we rely on 
their assurances not to shoot us 
down?” 

“I think so. Let it sit for an 
hour while they chew on it. I 
have a lot of phone calls going 
now so that you won’t be wound- 
ing any feelings when you land. 
Let them gel, too. By the way. 
Where you fellows from?” 

“Yesss. Well, we haven’t got 
yoiu’ name for the place yet. It’s 
about four light-years from here, 
aad as soon as we identify it in 

180 



your language we’ll name it for 
you.” 

“Been here before?” 

“Yesss, but not lately. We got 
here, oh let’s see, about eighty 
million years ago.” 

TV yCusser shook His head. “Boy, 
-^^-*-you fellows live a lot long- 
er than we do.” 

“Hold it. When I say ‘we,’ I 
mean my race was here. We don’t 
live much longer than you do. 
I guess we average out to some- 
thing like ninety or one hundred 
of your years. Damn shame, isn’t 
it?” 

“Yeah. How come somebody as 
smart as you hasn’t figured out 
a way to live forever?” 

“We’re not smart, at least not 
that smart. Hell, we’re not much 
smarter than you. That’s why we 
want to make sure your people 
won’t take a shot at us when we 
land. We don’t have any weap- 
ons aboard. We can’t hurt you 
here on your planet. Fact is, we 
can help you. We can teach you 
to build the engines that power 
this ship, and maybe a couple 
of other things. But we can’t 
teach you much. You won’t want 
to go space traveling any more 
than we do. Speed of light is 
tops. If it weren’t for the clock 
paradox we couldn’t get here at 
all. When we get back home ev- 
erybody we knew will be long 
dead. That’s a pretty high price 

GALAXY 



to pay for the privilege of going 
for a space jaunt. We do it ev- 
ery once in a while, but not of- 
ten. 

“We made this trip because 
we wanted to see what happened 
after our last visit. We didn’t 
really expect to find this kind of 
an advanced civilization. When 
we were here last time, things 
were in a mess. Swampy, hot, 
wet everywhere, and huge damn 
animals with big teeth — yes 
we’ve got the word. Dinosaurs. 
The place was all over dino- 
saurs.” 

“Yeah, well, some people think 
things must have been better in 
those days anjrway.” 

“You have that kind, too, 
huh? Believe me, they weren’t. 
Our people couldn’t safely leave 
the ship. We had no weapons. 
We managed to get some study- 
ing done anyway. Boy, let me 
tell you. This planet is a legend 
back home. We scare our young- 
sters with stories and pictures 
about it. Wait until you see the 
pictures.” 

“Hey, great. Our scientific 
community will go off its rocker 
to see actual pictures of Earth 
eighty million years ago. And 
some of the live stock, too, you 
say?” 

“Most of it. Wait until you 
see the animals. When we left 
we seeded the place with a blood- 
sucking grub we use to make 

WELCOME CENTAURIANS 



food for us, the way you use a 
cow. Left them all over the place 
— figured they might kill off the 
dinosaurs. We had a bad few 
minutes when we first got here 
this time. That grub was a para- 
site, and somewhat adaptable, 
and we thought you might be 
the evolutionary product of the 
grub. But you’re not — nothing 
like the way it could possibly 
turn out. It might still be around, 
though. That’s one of the things 
we’d like to check into, if you’ll 
let us.” 

“Sure, far as I’m concerned. 
Say, you’re talking a lot better. 
You learn fast.” 

“Yes, we do that. We commu- 
nicate by squeezing air through 
many narrow tubes that whistle. 
To make your kind of sounds I 
squeeze my air into a voice box 
that I control with my . call 
them hands. It takes some prac- 
tice.” 

“Like I said, you’re pretty 
smart.” 

“Not much. You could run 
films for us. We have eyes some- 
thing like yours, and we can 
make records. We can read 
books. 

We can give you wires with 
our information on them. You 
can play them back. But we 
have only got a week here be- 
fore we have to head home; we 
have a schedule that we ought 
to stick to.” 

181 



tC'^eah,” said Musser. “Wait 
a minute while I see how 
our clearances are coming along 
down here.” Musser was by now 
surrounded by a huge mob kept 
off the platform only by a ring 
of police. He called out, “Ser- 
geant, how’re things coming!” 
“Pretty good. Sir. The New 
York police are already clear- 
ing out the U.N. grounds to 
make sure no nut gets at them. 
Most of the others are all set. 
Another few minutes. 

Musser started to speak, but 
the voice said, “We heard him, 
Lee. Sounds promising.” 

Musser nodded. “I think you 
will be all right. How are your 
checks coming?” 

“All in order, those that have 
answered.” 

“How do you manage to get 
along so well in all those lan- 
guages?” 

“We pick them up fast. Can 
you get to the U.N. in an hour?” 
“Yep. You ready to come 
down?” 

“Yep. Meet , you there then.” 
The hum of static stopped, and 
Musser stepped off the platform. 

A platoon formed around him 
and led him to a copter nearby. 
There was a delay of a few min- 
utes while the troops moved the 
crowd back, and then the copter 
took off and headed swiftly for 
New York City. They were there 
in forty minutes. The New York 

182 



police had cleared the U.N. Pla- 
za, so the copter put down there 
to drop off Musser and his crew, 
and then it left. Musser found 
himself in the midst of a group 
of very important people, all of 
whom wanted to talk to him and 
make suggestions. Musser listen- 
ed and smiled pleasantly and 
nodded, and started them talk- 
ing among themselves. 

“There it is.” The cry went up 
from the crowd, and they all 
looked up to see the silver dot 
in the sky grow quickly larger 
as it dropped toward them. It did 
not seem to slow down as it 
neared the surface and assumed 
surprisingly large dimensions. A 
few women began screaming, and 
the crowd out on the street 
surged with panic and then scat- 
tered as the great globe plum- 
meted to within a hundred yards 
of the ground and then stopped. 
It blotted out the sun, but the 
panicky crowd grew quiet, and 
then the great sphere settled 
slowly to the ground, crushing a 
few trees as it landed. As it 
made its final move, Musser, un- 
noticed, left the group he was 
with and walked alone to a point 
near where its base would touch! 
the ground. When it hit he cran- 
ed his neck looking for a door or 
hatch. Seeing none, he began to 
circle. Halfway around he found 
it and waved his radioman over. 
He picked up the microphone 

GALAXY 



and said, “Well, so far so good. 
Everything all right in there?” 
“Great in Here Lee Musser. 
All right out there ?” 

“Yeah. You scared a few peo- 
ple when you came down, but 
nothing serious. Come on out.” 
“Well, I want to make sure 
you are ready for us. I want to 
remind you again that we are not 
exactly supermen in appearance. 
I doubt you have anything Here 
on Earth that looks quite like 
us.” 

Musser said, “All right. You 
apologized. Come on out.” 

“We note you’ve got TV cam- 
eras hooked up all over Hell and 
gone. I think a lot of your peo- 
ple are likely to faint. Is that 
all right?” 

“Sure is. Come on out.” 
“Are there any kooks out there 
that might start shooting when 
they got a look at us?” 

Musser sighed. “You know? 
For the first meeting in the his- 
tory of mankind with extrater- 
restrials, you certainly are kick- 
ing up a lot of fuss about show- 
ing yourself.” He glanced at the 
nearest police captain, who nod- 
ded to him. “Everything’s Hunky 
dory out here, the police tell me. 
We’re not expecting a Robert 
Taylor. Come on out.” 

“Okay, if you say so.” 

'^he hatch swung outward and 
a ramp slid down to the 

WELCOME CENTAURIANS 



ground. There was a moment’s 
pause and out came an object, 
down the ramp, alive, all rigEt; 
but only obviously so because it 
moved. It was brown in color, 
about three feet long, two feet 
wide, and five inches thick, 
roughly rectangular in shape, and 
around its perimeter was a fringe 
of appendages, finger-thick and 
five inches long, spaced an inch 
or so apart. The rectangle moved 
in ripples that traveled down its 
length, and in the front ' eight 
appendages it carried a black 
box four inches on a side. It flow- 
ed up to Musser’s feet and stop- 
ped, and out of the box came the 
words, “Well, what do you 
think?” 

Musser said, “You look like a 
damn bath mat.” 

“Yes. Well, where I come from 
you’d look like the rack we dry 
food on.” 

Musser nodded and said, “Fig- 
ures.” He walked around the 
creature, noticing a row of eyes 
all around the perimeter. Mus- 
ser said, “Where’s your brain?” 

“Brain? Oh', thinking tissue. 
Strung out inside the muscle 
sheaths. Where else?” 

“Yeah. It seems to me you’re 
pretty well built for moving, 
working and all like that. How 
come you were so shy about com- 
ing out? I think you’re a pretty 
good looking guy. You are a guy, 
aren’t you?” 

183 



“That’s a little hard to say.” 

“Well, if it isn’t important to 
you, it isn’t to me. Welcome to 
Earth, Mat. Mind if I call you 
Mat?” 

“Not at all. Let me get the rest 
of us out here. Why don’t you 
bring your people over and we 
can talk and get the formalities 
over and get to know one an- 
other.” 

Most of the important people 
joined them, although' a few 
were afraid to come too close. 
At first the Earth people were 
afraid of stepping on the extra- 
terrestrials. But then Mat asked 
Musser to step up on him while 
he carefully carried Musser 
around in a small circle to show 
that they were strong and not 
easily hurt. Out of the spaceship 
came the unearthly equivalent 
of chairs — half cylinders — over 
which the visitors draped them- 
selves. There a dozen of them, 
and soon the plaza buzzed with 
conversation as scientists and TV 
interviewers began pumping the 
visitors. 

Several hours passed, and Mus- 
ser said to Mat, “Maybe we 
ought to organize. Let’s get our 
communication people over here 
to set up with you a system for 
swapping information. Also, set 
your own schedule for eating, 
sleeping, and whatever else you 
do.” 

“You’ve got a good logical 
184 



mind, Lee Musser. Let’s do it.” 
It took two hours to set up a 
smooth running schedule of in- 
formation exchange. Off to one 
side the TV news services were 
happily interviewing one of the 
visitors for the benefit of the 
world-wide audience. A team of 
Earthside scientists agreed on 
the needed equipment and locat- 
ed most of it at Columbia, 
N.Y.U. and Brooklyn Polytech- 
nic. An orderly hubbub settled in. 
Streams of Earthpeople poured 
past in controlled lines, looking 
at the activities; congressmen, 
senators, governors, presidents of 
corporations, scholars, renowned 
sports figures, actors. 

T he next day Musser said, 
“Everything all right from 
your end. Mat?” 

“Yes, Lee. We’re into your 
astronomy, and your name for 
our home is Proxima Centauri.” 
“Nice to know. Welcome, Cen- 
taimians. You know, you’ve al- 
ready stopped looking like bath 
mats to most of us.” 

“Nice to know. We can look 
at you without thinking about 
food, too. Funny, we’re pretty 
much alike in mental outlook. I 
wonder if our scientists will be 
able to explain that. We’ve given 
them some of our tissue, and 
you’ve given us some of yours. 

Maybe they can make some- 
thing out of it. And your people 

GALAXY 



are sure wild about those pic- 
tures my people made eighty 
million years ago. They empha- 
sized how much we had changed 
in eighty million years. We used 
to be a lot thicker and shorter 
than we are now. So it goes, all 
tilings change. We’re looking at 
your paleontology texts. Those 
damn parasites we left behind 
must have killed off your dino- 
sauers, but there ought to be 
some fossils, at least. How are 
your people doing with the the- 
ory of our space drive?” 

Musser said, “They think they 
Have it mastered. We’ll have a 
couple of ships built in a few 
years. That’s a big thing you’ve 
done for us Mat. I don’t know 
how long it would have taken 
us to get it on our own. That 
space drive theory is subtle. 

“What are friends for? This 
way we’ll see you out in the 
Centauri neighborhood before 
long. No reason why we can’t 
continue the exchange. We’ve got 
to crack out of here in another 
two days to meet our schedule.” 

“Yeah. Things won’t be the 
same around here after you go.” 

Two days later they gathered 
for the farewell. 

Musser said, “If I knew how 
to shake hands with a guy like 
you I would.” 

“I know how you feel. When 
I put my voice box down in a 
minute. I want you to have it.” 

WELCOME CENTAURIANS 



“Thanks, Mat. I want you to 
take this.” Musser leaned over 
and slid his West Point class ring 
on one of Mat’s finger-like ap- 
pendages. They stood quietly, 
and then Musser said, “Say, Mat. 
Our biologists found out some- 
thing they wanted you to know 
from me. You’re more of Earth 
than you think. That change in 
form you went through in the 
last eighty million years? It was 
caused by your visit here; we 
can trace the chromosomal ori- 
gin of the tissue to mycelium 
from Earth. You have it all 
through you. Yessir, while he was 
here, one of your ancestors must 
have inadvertently mated with a 
mushroom.” 

Mat said, “We suspected some- 
thing like that. We have a bit 
of news I’m supposed to give you 
privately, too. We finally found 
those parasites were the first 
mammals on Earth. We seem to 
have seeded your planet with the 
first mammals. I’m afraid they 
are your remote ancestors.” 

Musser shrugged his shoul- 
ders and said, “Figures. It’s just 
too bad they’re afraid to an- 
nounce it, both ways. Look how 
close we turned out to be.” 

“Yeah,” said Mat. “What are 
they worried about?” He flipped 
his voice box up at Musser and 
moved up the ramp. The take- 
off was uneventful.

QcUo/XM 






by ALOIS BUDRYS 



Tf science fiction has a more 
meticulous creator than James 
Blish, that patient individual has 
thus far escaped my notice. Ray 
Bradbury, poet of tlie nuance, 
has said that he devoted much 
labor and attention, early in his 
career, to performing exhaustive 
dissections of Sturgeon’s (then 
existing) body of work. Sturgeon 



186 



himself can tell you the why of 
every word in every one of his 
stories (most writers can’t, and 
many take pride in that). And a 
lot of writers can go on and on 
about their motives, messages, 
moods and meditations. But I 
mean what I said — Blish’ is not 
merely introspective, and he is 
long, long past any apprentice- 
ships. He is meticulously crea- 
tive, and a lot of the time his 
creations have the inexhausti- 
bility of real things. They re- 
ward re-reading not by repeating 
a familiar and pleasant flow of 
words but by presenting further 
aspects of what prove to be com- 
plex ideas. 

For this reason, Black Easier 
(Doubleday, $3.95) not only left 
me curiously dissatisfied — I’m 
going to explain why this may 
be due to a whopping blind spot 
I happen to have — but seriously 
worried that if I were to re-read 
it enough, I might pluck out of 
it something vital that has es- 
caped me. 

However, let’s get at it from 
one end to the otlier. 

At the opening end, there is a 
very brief and hazardous author’s 
statement that this book is actu- 
ally the third volume in a tril- 
ogy, that the overall title of the 
trilogy is After Such Knowledge, 
and that the other two books are 
Doctor Mirabilis, a historical 
novel about Roger Bacon, and 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



A Case of Conscience — a sci- 
ence-fiction novel (and a mag- 
nificent one, in case you haven’t 
read it). Black Easter is that 
classic of fantasy, the deal-witH- 
the-devil story. 

Doctor Mirabilis, a book well 
and seriously received in Eng- 
land, Has never been published in 
the U.S.A., you will have to trust 
me, I guess, in my possibly in- 
correct statement that the only 
overt link among the parts of the 
trilogy is that the principal char- 
acters of all three books are vi- 
tally concerned with intense 
questions of theology. The author 
says the books are independent of 
each other except for subject 
matter, and if you’re sure you 
know what he’s referring to, then 
you can act on his word. 

Black Easter is subtitled “Faust 
Aleph-Null,” the title of the mag- 
azine version. “Why, this is Hell; 
nor am I out of it,” sasrs Chris- 
topher Marlowe on the title page, 
and a little farther on, Albertus 
Magnus says it is not reason- 
able to suppose that Aristotle 
knew the number of the Elect. 
The author, Having caused all 
this to appear in the book, which 
he dedicates to C. S. Lewis, also 
includes an introduction in 
which he vouches for the care he 
took in researching the rituals de- 
scribed in the book. And then we 
are off, under this freight of 
clues, signs, preparations and sig- 

187 



ils, into a story that begins with 
a sentence designed to remind 
you of “Who Goes There?” or 
the scene in whicK young Roger’s 
room explodes in the light of a 
torch, or some other reference I’m 
not privy to, but which is pretty 
clearly intended to refer to some- 
thing beyond the narrative, for 
it’s instantly qualified for the 
purposes of the actual scene to 
be set. (When Blish waters down 
a preceding sentence, it’s because 
he’s just gotten done hitting you 
with a quotation, not because He’s 
too lazy to rewrite). 

What now follows is a story in 
which a ruthless munitions mil- 
lionaire — one hardly needs the 
first modifier, does one? — ap- 
proaches a black magician for 
the purpose of intensifying the 
amount of chaos in the world. 
The magician, a dedicated. Hard- 
working, learned craftsman, first 
performs two preliminary jobs, 
for the purpose of demonstrating 
His ability, we are told, and then 
opens the lid of Pandora’s box. 
He performs everything needful 
to keep the lid open only a crack, 
and only for a specified time. He 
does not blow his cool, and his 
assistants do falter but do not 
fail. Yet the world is destroyed, 
and he is dragged off into the 
Pit. Why has he failed to main- 
tain control of the demons, when 
everything He did was in accord- 
ance with the previously well es- 
188 



tablished relationship between 
himself and the ruler of Heaven 
and Hell? Because, the Devil 
says, God is dead. 

All right. Up to a point, what 
we had was a story much like 
the regrettably scarce Unknown 
novellas of years ago, with the 
addition of priests and other fea- 
tures dealt with in ways John 
Campbell never published. But 
by those standards, I’m not even 
doing something reprehensible 
by giving away the punchline, 
because by those standards this 
novel is an unreasonably inflated 
short story, not deserving of 
much care as an entity, for all 
that individual scenes and char- 
acterizations are handled with 
Blish’s accustomed virtuosity in 
such matters. 

I can’t believe those are the 
standards Blish intended, because 
of the great care he has taken to 
put so many markers on this 
story. One does not lightly offer 
any companion to Mirabilis and 
A Case of Conscience, particularly 
when one is their author, and es- 
pecially when that author is gen- 
uinely concerned with religion, 
not with trick endings. 

I would be more at ease — a 
great deal more at ease — if I 
did not have this blind spot I 
mentioned in Paragraph 2, said 
blind spot being that I cannot 
accept any fictional situation in 
which the God of the Bible ap- 

GALAXY 



pears as an operative character. 
I would in fact Have disqualified 
myself from reviewing this book, 
except tliat I strongly suspect 
I’m hot alone, by far, in experi- 
encing tfus failure of the suspen- 
sion of disbelief, belief, or unbe- 
lief, take your choice. And I more 
than suspect that BlisK knows 
perfectly well his last line will not 
play the way he appears to expect 
it to play. You pay your money 
and you take your choice — 
Lewis, in Perelandia, obviously 
did expect his readers to go along 
with a literal wrestle with the 
Devil (and a most imconvincing 
one, at that). Blish quotes Mar- 
lowe, harking back to Unknown’s 
None But Lucifer (by H. L. Gold 
and L. Sprague deCamp)” yet 
assuredly (?) Earth and Hell in 
Black Easter are not the same 
place ... to begin with, anyway. 

I don’t know. I would disqual- 
ify myself on those grounds, too, 
except that think I’m accurately 
portraying the potential reaction 
of many readers. I could resolve 
my difficulties by re-reading the 
book until I felt I understood it. 
But would you be patient for 
long? Have you read it several 
times already, by the time this 
review appears in print? Or I 
could pick up a phone, and ask 
Jim some of these questions. But 
would you? 

Strange. Strange. So opaque a 
book from so pellucid a writer . 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



Let’s go to a pellucid book by 
a man who sprays words in a 
dazzle of light. 

Qamuel R. Delany i§ the best 
^ science-fiction writer in the 
world. As partial evidence, I of- 
fer you Nova (Doubleday, $4.95 
— ^pay the hardcover price and 
place the volume in your library). 

If he lives long enough, Delany 
will get the full treatment from 
the slick magazine blurb writers, 
from the literary editors, and 
from critics more polished and 
prestigious than your humble ser- 
vant. He will be interviewed, 
quoted, discussed, photographed 
standing alone on a beach at 
dawn, photographed sharing an 
apple with a child, and be offered 
a role in an underground movie. 
I just want to say it while it’s 
true. Samuel R. Delany, right 
now, as of this book. Nova, not 
as of some future book or some 
accumulated body of work, is the 
best science-fiction writer in the 
world, at a time when competi- 
tion for that status is intense. 

I don’t see how a science-fiction 
writer can do more than wring 
your heart while explaining How 
it works. No writer can. The spe- 
cial thing that science fiction does 
is to first credibly place the heart 
in an unconventional environ- 
ment. A particular thing that re- 
cent science fiction has been do- 
ing is to make that unconven- 

189 



tional environment a teclino- 
logical one. Another Has been to 
make it a romantic one, some- 
times calling it an intensely hu- 
manistic one, or a psychedelic 
one. All of these things are ac- 
complished in Nova by Samuel 
R. Delany, the world’s best sci- 
ence-fiction writer. 

But let’s go about this in some 
systematic way. What makes this 
book, among all books, offer me 
the conviction that its author 
stands at some pinnacle? 

Well, for one thing it success- 
fully combines a number of 
strong, well handled story ele- 
ments. It is highly entertaining 
to read, and it involves the read- 
er in the unfolding of events. It 
does so on a number of levels, 
and it does so while using classi- 
cal science-fiction elements 

For example, the story of in- 
terstellar politico-economics is a 
well established and thoroughly 
explored vehicle in science fic- 
tion Having chosen to set his 
story in this framework, Delany 
is obligated to make it believable 
— to make it develop meaning- 
fully to give it a history and to 
promise it a future The genera- 
tions-long galaxy-wide power 
struggle between the contending 
factions in Nova meets all of 
these criteria. The human events 
in the book are all valid parts 
of the one central politico-eco- 
nomic event they interact with, 
190 



They are influenced by and in- 
fluence it, believably and direct- 

ly- 

Delany’s technical accomplish- 
ment in bringing off this portion 
of the story, in the necessarily re- 
stricted space he allows himself, 
is impressive. People who special- 
ize in this kind of story have 
often taken much lengthier paths 
to getting it told. Delany tackles 
it like an old master. Which he 
is not; he simply seems like one. 

But within the story of what 
quarter — or, more accurately, 
third — of the human galaxy 
will come out on top is tire story 
of who will reach the Illyrion 
first. And this, too, is a classical 
science-fiction story in its aspect 
of explaining that Illyrion is a 
physical element — albeit a most 
unconventional one — whose 
properties make it the basic uni- 
versal power source (and hence 
make its possession a potent po- 
litico-economic factor) and whose 
properties furthermore are cru- 
cial to the plot climax. That is, 
this is a useful, good, effective 
thing to have in an sf story pro- 
vided you can make it scientifi- 
cally believable and then make it 
it artistically believable. There 
are a lot of places where a sci- 
ence-fiction writer can fall down 
right here — in his science, and in 
his fiction, as well as in his writ- 
ing — and Delany dances through 
them. Up to now, I thought only 

GALAXY 



Larry Niven could make stellar 
mechanics as functionally under- 
standable as this. 

The story of v,/here tKe Illyri- 
on is to be reached is, again, an 
example of virtuosity in these 
several places ; it is also the work- 
ing out of the classically posed 
scientific puzzle. All the clues 
are given in the beginning of the 
story, and the ending satisfactori- 
ly explains their relevance. At the 
same time, all these many other 
things are going on, and Delany 
is plausibly telling us how a man 
might pilot a vessel through' a 
nova. 

And we haven’t even touched 
yet on the story of Lorq Von Ray 
and his blood-struggle against the 
psychopathic Prince and Prince’s 
sister. Ruby Red, whom Lorq 
loves, but it’s in the telling of 
that story that Delany wiU as- 
suredly reach you where you live; 
I really don’t see how some as- 
pect of that story can fail to seem 
very true and poignant to you. 

But leave that. We have 
many good storytellers in the 
field, especially lately, who can 
involve you in interpersonal dra- 
ma. They are all Ted Sturgeon’s 
children, if you want to oversim- 
plify. What about taking the cy- 
borg idea, and painting a picture 
of a civilization where everyone 
plugs directly into his tools? 
What about then making you 
realize that a socketed man plug- 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



ged into a factory literally puts 
the raw materials in with his bare 
hands and nudges and pushes the 
product along the processing 
line. 

His brain, after all, cannot 
then tell the difference between 
telling his hand to scoop and 
telling an automated train of 
ore cars to roll into the unloading 
dock. AU right? Then Delany 
makes you realize that if this is 
true — which is a little past 
where Cordwainer Smith left it, 
already — then such a factory 
worker has a sense of accomplish- 
ment and identity with his prod- 
uct that is now lost to the 20th 
century and has in fact been lost 
to us all since the disappearance 
of the artisan. And that this be- 
comes a major social fact in the 
world of the future ... a re- 
deeming fact of technology, with 
all its intense humanistic impli- 
cations arrived at via the route 
of playing on the sensorium. And 
what of the hero who scoops up 
seven tons of Illyrion in his bare 
Hands and tips the balance of in- 
terstellar power, of history and of 
Human yearning? 

I Haven’t even told you about 
the Mouse. Or Dan. Or the syr- 
inx, or Istanbul, or the puns. I’ll 
give a clue about Delany the 
writer this year as distinct from 
Delany the writer last year. In 
The Einstein Inteisection, Looby 
Has a musical machete. In Nova,

Mouse Kas a syrinx and calls it 
an ax almost rigHt away — it’s 
later that you get tfie jest. 

There are a couple of things 
that might have been done bet- 
ter. I’ll list a couple to save time 
— Brian was a good idea, but 
shouldn’t have been just let go 
if he was going to be a character 
in the book at all. Since a func- 
tion like Brian is necessary to the 
story, it probably should have 
been a piece of prose rather than 



a person. And we should have 
seen some Illyrion at the end; we 
need a flash of the Grail, for 
credibility. Okay? Satisfied? 

But I never said this was the 
world’s best science-fiction book. 
It’s so far the best book of the 
year, not coincidentally because 
it’s a book, this year, by the 
world’s best science-fiction writ- 
er. That’s what I said.

GALAXY’S STARS 



Ben Bova, whose Foeman, 
Where Do You Flee? leads off 
this issue, marks his tenth year as 
a science-fiction writer in 1969. 
His first appearance was with a 
juvenile novel, The Star Conquer- 
ors, since which he has published 
ten books, plus a number of ar- 
ticles and stories. 

The articles, he says, began 
when “Isaac Asimov was ap- 
proached by Cele Goldsmith to 
do a series on ‘Life on Other 
Worlds’. He was busy and didn’t 
want to do it, but he told Cele 
that Ben Bova, who knew just 
as much about it as he did, would 
be glad to do the series. Then 
he called me and told me what 
he had told Cele. After reviving 
me he said, ‘Now, here’s what I 
mean. You’ll know just as much 
as I do, because if you get stuck 
I’ll help you.’ I frequently got 
stuck. Isaac was a big help.” 

Bova’s basic career is as Co- 
ordinator of Marketing for Avco- 
Everett Research Laboratory in 
Massachusetts, which principally 
does research in high-temperature 
gas physics, which includes ev- 
erything from re-entry physics 
to gas lasers. Among other inter- 
esting projects is a means of 
protecting a spacecraft from le- 
thal doses of radiation, such as 
solar-flare occurrences. “It turns 



out,” Bova says, “that you may 
be able to predict solar flares 
well enough so that on a three- 
or four-day mission to the moon 
you can time your mission so 
that there won’t be a flare. But 
when you start traveling out to- 
ward Mars you’re going to be in 
deep space so long that there’s 
bound to be a flare of serious 
enough intensity so that you’re 
going to need radiation shielding. 
You can shield with a cement 
wall, but that’s kind of bulky. 
One of the things we’re trying 
to do is shield with a magnetic 
field to keep these high-energy 
protons away from the spacecraft 
by deflecting them. This calls 
for real good knowledge of the 
interplay of magnetic energy and 
plasmas, in the field of study 
called magnetohydrodynamics.” 
Bova, a regular at the annual 
Milford Science-fiction Writers’ 
Conference, says that the Con- 
ference reminds him of some of 
the things that happen at the lab. 
“In the laboratory a research man 
reports periodically on his work 
in front of a sort of jury of peers, 
who will offer generally friendly, 
sometimes pretty barbed, criti- 
cism of what he’s doing. The guy 
goes away sometimes bloody, but 
usually wiser. At Milford the 
same thing is done to manuscripts 



193 



that all of the writers submit.” 
John Brunner, whose Thing- 
of-the-Month-Club japes are a 
Galaxy feature, is a Londoner 
who has functioned as editor, poet 
and critic as well as writer. His 
views on writing are worth lis- 
tening to; “We ought to get back 
to the old idea of a ‘masterpiece’ 
— that is to say, a task one sets 
oneself in order to demonstrate 
that one has fully mastered the 
basics of the writing craft. Picas- 
so, to my mind, could never have 
become the seminal influence 
on modern art that he is 
had he not been one of the great 
portrait painters of his genera- 
tion. I have a feeling that perhaps 
I’ve been fortunate in coming 
up the slow way in science fic- 
tion; none of my early books 
achieved immediate wide ac- 



claim; they just sold and brought 
me in a steady living. And now, 
finally, after ten years of free- 
lancing, I think I’ve done a book 
which will stand up Head and 
shoulders above everything else 
I’ve ever written. This is Stand 
on Zanzibar, from Doubleday.” 

James Tiptree, Jr., one of our 
more peripatetic writers, is just 
back from a fishing sojourn amid 
the primeval rocky lochs of 
Northern Scotland. Saw no LocH 
Ness monsters. He reports; also 
no fish. 

Larry Niven (T/ie Organleg- 
gars') won a Hugo for Neutron 
Star, published a year or two ago 
in ff. Aroimd the Galaxy office 
there is a feeling that he may be 
about due for another one for 
The Organleggers ... 



TRICKS OR TREATS 

The trick is to write the number of possible results of flipping n coins, 
even when n is unknown because you've hidden some of the coins. The 
solution is to draw the row of coins, or have someone else do it, and 
then merely write the number 1 in front of it. The answer is the number 
of possible results in binary notation. 

Assume you've drawn 8 coins: OOOOOOOO. There are 256 possible 
results. Writing the number 1 before them gives you the binary number 
lOOOOOOOO, equivalent to decimal 256, which is the right answer. 
This is so regardless of how many zeroes ("coins") you have drawn, and 
this regardless of whether you can count them or not. 

"Oh, I didn't know you meant to give the answer as a binary 
number!" 

(If you don't know what binary numbers are, ask any twelve-year-old; 
as a last resort, you might even look up a copy of Digifs and Dastards, 
published by Ballantine Books, written by your editor.)
