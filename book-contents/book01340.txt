The Day We Launched The Moonship 



A few hours ago (as this is writ- 
ten) we strugg-led up out of a 
Bound sleep at the unearthly hour 
of 4:30 in the morning, drove thirty 
miles along what used to be the 
rattlesnake barrens of Cape Cana- 
veral and is now the world’s first 
and largest spaceport and watched 
the launching of that (literally) 
howling success, Saturn V. 

By the time you read this it will 
all be ancient history, of course. But 
now it’s still fresh in our mind, 
every minute of it, from the first 
graying of dawn over the Atlantic 
to the babble of excited mutual con- 
gratulations, German accents prais- 
ing Texas drawls, in the coffeeshops 
of the Cocoa Beach motels when 
everyone gathered for a late, and 
very joyous, breakfast. Everything 
worked. The whole drama of the 
situation was that there was no dra- 
ma. The beast rose up and flew with 
as little unexpected event as you 
might find in the takeoff of the 
shuttle flight from New York to 
Boston, every hour on the hour. As 
little as you might find when you 
get into your car to go to the groc- 
ery. 

It’s still a pretty expensive, in- 
herently wasteful, process, this 
business of throwing a couple thou- 
sand pounds of metal into orbit by 
exploding gases under it. There 
ought to be better ways. Probably 
there are, and we’ll find them. 



But meanwhile Wemher von 
Braun and his boys have provided 
us with this one way of getting to 
the Moon that has the advantage of 
being ready right now — and work- 
able on schedule, on demand, no 
problems. 

O f course, we science-fiction' types 
always knew it would wo>rk out 
this way, and no doubt for most of 
us the big question has not been so 
much “Can we travel in space?” as 
it has been “What the dickens is 
taking us so long?” 

A couple of decades from now 
we, or our children, will remember 
with amusement and even increduli- 
ty how people used to throw away 
95% of a spaceship to get 5% into 
a parking orbit. That vast noise that 
broke glass, shattered nerves, was 
heard 800 miles away will be recall- 
ed as a symptom of incredibly poor 
efficiency. By then no doubt we’ll 
have reusable launch vehicles, like 
the Douglas Hyperion, and better 
ways of applying power, and Earth- 
Lunar commutation tickets. (Just as 
we now have commuters from New 
York to Los Angeles — in energy 
terms, a more expensive trip.) 

But that’s a couple decades from 
now. 

Right now we’ve got a moonship 
. and it works !

FIRST OF THREE PARTS IF • Sertaf 




by LARRY NIVEN 



The romrobof hod been on its way 
from Earth for decades — and now 
if was changing a world overnight! 



Illustrated by ADKIN3* 



1 

A ramrobot had been the first to 
s^e Mount Lookitthat. Ramro- 
bots had been first visitors to all the 
settled worlds. The, interstellar ram- 
scoop robots, with an unrestricted 
fuel supply called from interstellar 
hydrogen, could travel between stars 
at speeds approaching that of light. 



Long ago the UN had sent ram- 
robots to nearby stars to search out 
habitable planets. 

It was a peculiarity of the first 
ramrobots that they were not choosy. 
The Procyon ramrobot, for instance, 
had landed on We Made It in spring. 
Had it landed in summer or winter, 
when the planet’s axis points through 
its sun, it would have sensed the 



6 



fifteen-hundred-mile-per-hour winds. 
The Sirius ramrobot had searched 
out the two narrow habitable bands 
on Jinx> but had not been pro- 
grammed to report the planet’s other 
peculiarities. And the Tau Ceti ram- 
robot, Interstellar Ramscoop Robot 
No. 4, had landed on Mount Lookit- 
that. 

Only the Plateau on Mount 
Lookitthat was habitable. The rest of 
the planet was an eternal, searing 
black calm, useless for any purpose. 
The Plateau was smaller than any 
region a colony project would settle 
by choice. But Interstellar Ramscoop 
Robot #4 had found a habitable 
point, and that was all it knew. 

The colony slowboats which follow- 
ed the ramrobots had not been built 
to make round trips. Their passen- 
gers had to stay, always. And so 
Mount Lookitthat was settled, more 
than three hundred years ago. 

A flock of police cars fanned out 
behind the fleeing man. He 
could hear them buzzing like sum- 
mer bumblebees. Now, too late, they 
were using all their power. In the 
air this pushed them to one hundred 
miles per hour: fast enough for trans- 
portation in as small a region as 
Mount Lookitthat, but, just this once, 
not fast enough-to win a race. The 
running man was only yards from 
the edge. 

Spurts of dust erupted ahead of the 
fugitive. At last the Implementation 
police had decided to risk damaging 
the body. The man hit the dust like a 
puppet thrown in anger, turned over 
hugging one knee. Then he was 
scrambling for the cliff’s sharp edge 



on the other knee and two hands. 
He jerked once more, but kept mov- 
ing. At the very edge he looked up 
to see a* circling car coming right 
at him from the blue void be- 
yond .... 

With the tip of his tongue held 
firmly between his teeth, Jesus Pietro 
Castro aimed his car at the en- 
raged, agonized, bearded face. An 
inch too low and he’d hit the cliff; 
an inch too high and he’d miss the 
man, rniss his chance to knock him 
back onto the Plateau. He pushed 
two fan throttles forward — 

Too late. The man was gone. 

Later, they stood at the edge and 
looked down. 

Often J^us Pietro had watched 
groups of children standing fearful 
and excited at the void edge, looking 
down toward the hidden roots of 
Mount Lookitthat, daring each other 
to go closer — and closer. As a child 
he had done the same. The wonder 
of that view had never left him. 

Forty miles below, beneath a 
swirling sea of white mist, was the 
true surface of Mount Lookitthat, the 
planet. The great plateau on Mount 
Lookitthat, the mountain, had a sur- 
face less than half the size of Cali- 
fornia. All the rest of the world’s 
surface was a black oven, hot enough 
to melt lead, at the bottom of an at- 
mosphere sixty times as thick as 
Earth’s. 

Matthew Keller had committed, 
deliberately, one of the worst of pos- 
sible crimes. He had crawled off the 
edge of the Plateau, taking with him 
his eyes, his liver and kidneys, his 
miles of blood tubing and all twelve 
of his glands . taking everything 



SLOWBOAT CARGO

that could have gone into the Hos- 
pital’s organ banks to save the lives 
of those whose bodies were failing. 
Even his worth as fertilizer, not in- 
considerable on a three-hundred-year- 
old colony world, was now nil. Only 
the water in him would some day 
return to the upper world, to fall 
as rain on the lakes and rivers and 
as snow on the great northern glacier. 
Already, perhaps, he was dry and 
flaming in the awful heat forty miles 
below. 

Or had he stopped falling, even 
yet? 

Jesus Pietro, Head of Implemen- 
tation, stepped back with an effort. 
The formless mist sometimes brought 
strange hallucinations and stranger 
thoughts — like that odd member 
of the Rorschach inkblot set, the 
one sheet of cardboard which is 
blank. Jesus Pietro had caught him- 
self thinking that when his time came, 
if it ever came, this was the way he 
would like to go. And that was trea- 
son. 

The major met his eye with a 
curious reluctance. 

“Major,” said Jesus Pietro, “why 
did that man escape you?” 

The major spread his hands. “He 
lost himself in the trees for several 
minutes. When he broke for the edge 
it took my men a few minutes to spot 
him.” 

“How did he reach the trees? No, 
don’t tell me how he broke loose. 
Tell me why your cars didn’t catch 
him before he reached the grove.” 

The major hesitated a split second 
too long. Jesus Pietro said, “You were 
playing with him. He couldn’t reach 
his friends and he couldn’t remain 



hidden anywhere. So you decided to 
have a little harmless fun.” 

The major dropped his eyes. 
“You take his place,” said 
Jesus Pietro. 

T he playground was grass and 
trees, swings and teeter-totters 
and a slow, skeletal merry-go-round. 
The school surrounded it on three 
sides, a one-story building of archi- 
tectural coral, painted white. The 
fourth side, protected by a high fence 
of tame vine growing on wooden 
stakes, was the edge of Gamma 
Plateau, a steep cliff overlooking 
Lake Davidson on Delta Plateau. 

Matthew Leigh Keller sat beneath 
a watershed tree and brooded. Other 
children played all around him, but 
they ignored Matt. So did two teach- 
ers on monitor duty. People usually 
ignored Matt when he wanted to be 
alone. 

Uncle Matt was gone. Gone to a 
fate so horrible that the adults 
wouldn’t even talk about it. 

Implementation police had come 
to the house at sunset yesterday. 
They had left with Matt’s big, com- 
fortable uncle. Knowing that they 
were taking him to the Hospital, 
Matt had tried to stop those towering, 
uniformed men; but they’d been 
gentle and superior and firm, and 
an eight-year-old boy had not slowed 
them down at all. 

One day soon his uncle’s trial and 
conviction would be announced on 
the colonist teedee programs, along 
with the charges and the record of 
his execution. But that didn’t matter. 
That was just cleaning up. Uncle 
Matt would not be back.

IF 




A sting in his eyes warned Matt 
that he was going to cry. 

Harold Lillard stopped his aim- 
less running around when he realized 
that he was alone. He didn’t like to 
be alone. Harold was ten, big for his 
age, and he needed others around 
him. Preferably smaller others, chil- 
dren who could be dominated. Look- 
ing rather helplessly around him, he 
spotted a small form under a tree 
near the playground’s edge. Small 
enough. Far enough from the play- 
ground monitors. 

He started over. 

Under the tree. Matt looked up 
at him. ^ 

Harold lost interest. He wandered 
away with a vacant expression, mov- 
ing more or less toward the teeter- 
totters. 

II 

I nterstellar ramscoop robot #143 
left Juno at the end of a linear ac- 
celerator. Coasting toward insterstellar 
space, she looked like a huge metal 
insect, makeshift and hastily built. 
Yet, except for the contents of her 
cargo pod, she was identical to the 
last forty of her predecessors. Her 
nose was the ramscoop generator, 
a massive, heavily armored cylinder 
with a large orifice in the center. 
Along the sides were two big fusion 
motors, aimed ten degrees outward, 
mounted on oddly jointed metal 
structures like the folded legs of a - 
praying mantis. The hull was small, 
containing only a computer and an 
insystem fuel tank. 

Juno was invisible behind her 
when the fusion motors fired. Im- 



mediately the cable at her tail began 
to unroll. The cable was thirty miles 
long and was made of braided Sin- 
clair molecule chain. Trailing at the 
end was a lead capsule as heavy as 
the ramrobot itself. 

Identical cargo pods had been go- 
ing to the stars for centuries. But 
this one was special. 

Like Ramrobots #141 and #142, 
already moving toward Jinx and 
Wunderland • . like Ramrobot #144, 
not yet built . ramrobot #143 
carried the seeds of revolution. The 
revolution was already in process on 
Earth. On Earth it was quiet, order- 
ly. It would not be so on Mount 
Lookitthat. 

The medical revolution which be- 
gan with the beginning of the twen- 
tieth century had warped all human 
society for five hundred years. Ameri- 
ca had adjusted to Eli \^itney’s cot- 
ton gin in less than half that time. 
As with the gin, the effects would 
never quite die out. But already so- 
ciety was swinging back to what had 
once been normal. Slowly — but 
there was motion. 

In Brazil a small but growing al- 
liance agitated for the abolition of 
the death penalty for habitual traf- 
fic offenders. TTiey would be op- 
posed, but they would win. 

O n twin spears of actinic light the 
ramrobot approached Pluto’s 
orbit. Pluto and Neptune were both 
on the far side of the sun, and there 
were no ships nearby to be harmed 
by magnetic effects. 

The ramscoop generator came on. 
The conical field formed rather 
slowly, but when it had stopped oscil- 



SLOWBOAT CARGO

lating it was two hundred miles across. 
The ship began to drag a little, a 
very little, as the cone scooped up 
interstellar dust and hydrogen. She 
was still accelerating. Her insystem 
tank was idle now, and would be for 
the next twelve years. Her food 
would be the thin stuff she scooped 
out between the stars. 

In nearby space the magnetic ef- 
fects would have been deadly. 
Nothing with a notochord could live 
within three hundred miles of the 
storm of electromagnetic effects that 
was a working ramscoop generator. 
For hundreds of years men had been 
trying to build a magnetic shield ef- 
ficient enough to let men ride the 
ramrobots. They said it couldn’t be 
done, and they were right. A ram- 
robot could carry seeds and frozen 
fertile animal eggs, provided they 
were heavily shielded and were car- 
ried a good distance behind the 
ramscoop generator. Men must ride 
the slowboats, carrying their own 
fuel, traveling at less than half the 
speed of light. 

For ramrobot #143, speed built up 
rapidly over the years. The sun be- 
came a bright star, then a dim orange 
spark. The drag on the r^scoop be- 
came a fearsome thing, but it was 
more than compensated by the in- 
crease in hydrogen pouring into the 
fusion motor. The telescopes orbiting 
in Neptune’s Trojan points occasional- 
ly picked up the ramrobot’s steady 
fusion light, a tiny fierce blue-white 
point against Tau Ceti’s yellow. 

The universe shifted and changed. 
Ahead and behind the ramrobot, the 
stars crept together, until Sol and 
Tau Ceti were less than a light-year 



apart. Now Sol was dying-ember 
red, and Tau Ceti showed brilliant 
white. The pair of red dwarves 
known as L726-8, almost in the 
ramrobot’s path, had become warm 
yellow. And all the stars in all the 
heavens had a crushed look, as if 
somebody heavy had sat down on 
the universe. 

Ramrobot #143 reached the half- 
way point, 5.95 light-years as meas- 
ured relative to Sol, and kept going. 
Turnover was light-years off, since 
the ramscoop would slow the ship 
throughout the voyage. 

But a relay clicked in the ramro- 
bot’s computer. It was message time. 
The ramscoop flickered out, and the 
light died in the motors, as Ramro- 
bot ‘ #143 poured aU her stored 
power into a maser beam. For an 
hour the beam went out, straight 
ahead, reaching toward the system 
of Tau Ceti. Then the ramrobot 
was accelerating again, following 
close behind her own beam, but 
with the beam drawing steadily 
ahead. 

A line of fifteen-year-old boys had 
formed at the door of the med- 
check station, each holding a conical 
bottle filled with clear yellowish 
fluid. One by one they handed their 
specimen bottles to the hard-faced, 
masculine-looking lyirse, then stepped 
aside to wait for new orders. 

Matt Keller was third from the 
end. As the boy in front of him 
stepped aside, and the nurse raised 
one hand without looking up from 
her typewriter. Matt examined his 
bottle critically. “Doesn’t look so 
good,” he said. 



10 



IF 




The nurse looked up in furious 
impatience. A colonist brat, wasting 
her time! 

“I better run it through again,” 
Matt decided aloud. And he drank 
it. 

“It was apple juice,” he said later 
that night. “I almost got caught 
sneaking it into the medcheck station. 
But you really should have seen her 
face. She turned the damnedest 
color.” 

“But why?” his father asked in 
honest bewilderment. “Why anta- 
gonize Miss Prynn? You know she’s 
part crew. And these medical health 
records go straight to the Hospital!” 

“7 think it was funny,” Jeanne an- 
nounced. She was Matt’s sister, a 
year younger than Matt, and she al- 
ways sided with him. 

Matt’s grin seemed to slip from 
his face, leaving something dark, 
something older than his years. “One 
for Uncle Matt.” 

Mr. Keller glared at Jeanne, then 
at the boy. “You keep thinking like 
that, Matthew, and you’ll end up in 
the Hospital, just like he did! Why 
can’t you leave well enough alone?” 

His father’s evident concern pene- 
trated Matt’s mood. “Don’t worry, 
Genghis,” he said easily. “Miss 
Prynn’s probably forgotten all about 
it. I’m lucky that way.” 

“Nonsense. If she doesn’t report 
you it’ll be through sheer kindness.” 

“Fat chance of that,'' 

I n a small recuperation room in the 
treatment section of the Hospital, 
Jesus Pietro Castro sat up for the 
first time in four days. His opera- 
tion had been simple, though major; 

SLOWBOAT CARGO 



he now had a new left lung. He 
had also received a peremptory order 
from Millard Parlette, who was pure 
crew. He was to give up smoking im- 
mediately. 

He could feel the pull of the in- 
ternal surgical adhesive as he sat up 
to deal with four days of paperwork. 
The stack of forms his aide was 
setting on the bedside table looked 
disproportionately thick. He sighed, 
picked up a pen and went to work. 
, Fifteen minutes later he wrinkled 
his nose at some petty complaint — 
a practical joke — and started to 
crumple the paper. He unfolded it 
and looked again. He asked, “Mat- 
thew Leigh Keller?” 

“Convicted of treason,” Major 
Jansen said instantly. Six years ago. 
He escaped over the edge of Alpha 
Plateau, the void edge. The records 
say he went into the organ banks.” 
But he hadn’t, Jesus Pietro remem- 
bered suddenly. Major Jansen’s pre- 
decessor had gone instead. Yet Kel- 
ler had died .... “What’s he doing 
playing practical jokes in a colonist 
medcheck station?” 

After a moment of cogitation Ma- 
jor Jansen said, He had a nephew, 
same name.” 

“Nephew about fifteen now?” 
“Perhaps. I’ll check.” 

Kelle/s nephew, said Jesus Pietro 
to himself. / could follow standard 
practice and send him a reprimand. 
No, Let him think he’d got away 
with it. Give him room to move 
around in and one day he’d replace 
the body his uncle stole. 

Jesus Pietro smiled. He started to 
chuckle, but pain stabbed him in the 
ribs and he had to desist. 

11 





T he snout projecting from the 
ramscoop generator was no 
longer bright and shiny. Its surface 
montage of big and little pits, 



was a 

craterlets left by interstellar dust 
grains pushing their way through the 
ramscoop field. There was pitting 

everywhere, on the fusion motors, on 
K- the hull, even on the cargo pod 
I I thirty miles behind. The ship looked 

f f pebble-finished. 

The damage was all superficial. 
More than a century had passed 

since the rugged ramscoop design had 
suffered its last major change, 
r Now, eight and a half years beyond 
f Juno, the ramscoop field died for the 
second time. The fusion flames be- 
came two actinic blue candles generat- 
ing a twentieth of a gee. Slowly the 
I / cargo spool rewound until the cargo 
i pod was locked in its socket. 

I The machine seemed to hesitate 
I . and then its two cylindrical mo- 
\ tors rose from the hull on their pray- 
J ing-mantis legs. For seconds they rc- 
^ * I mained at right angles to the hull, 
f/ / Then, slowly, the legs contracted. But 
J' now the motors pointed forward. 

If L A U-shaped bar swung the cargo 
f pod around until it also pointed for- 
ward. Slowly the spool unwound to 
^^^its full length. 

. The ramscoop went on again. The 
motors roared their full strength, and 
now they fired their long streams of 
fusing hydrogen and fused helium 
through the ramscoop itself. 

Eight point three light-years from 
'^[XXSol, almost directly between Sol and 
^^0Tau Ceti, lie the twin red dwarf 
L726-8. Their main distinction 
-is that they’re the stars of smallest 
^mass known to man. Yet they are 



12 




heavy enough to have collected a 
faint envelope of gas. The ramrobot 
braked heavily as her ramscoop plow- 
ed through the fringes of that en- 
velope. 

She continued braking. The uni- 
verse stretched out again, the stars 
resumed their normal shapes and 
colors. Eleven point nine light-years 
from Sol, one hundred million miles 
above the star Tau Ceti, the ma- 
chine came to an effective stop. Her 
ramscoop went permanently off. A 
variety of senses began searching the 
sky. They stopped. Locked. 

Again she moved. She must reach 
her destination on the remaining fuel. 

Tau Ceti is a G8 star, about 400° 
cooler than Sol and only 45% as 
strong in its output of light. The 
world of Mount Lookitthat orbits 
sixty-seven million miles away, a 
moonless world in a nearly circular 
path. 

The ramrobot moved in on Mount 
Lookitthat, the world. She moved 
cautiously, for there were failsafe fac- 
tors in her computer program. Her 
senses probed. 

Surface temperature: 600° F., 

with little variation. Atmosphere: 
opaque, dense, poisonous near the 
surface. Diameter: 7650 miles. 

Something came over the horizon. 
In visible light it seemed an island in 
a sea of fog. A topography like a 
flight of broad, very shallow steps, 
flat plateaus separated by sheer cliffs. 
But Ramrobot #143 sensed more 
than visible light. There was Earth- 
like temperature, breathable air at an 
Earthlike pressure .... 

And there were two radio homing 
signals. 



*The signals settled it. Ramrobot 
#143 didn’t even have to decide 
which to answer, for they were com- 
ing from only a quarter of a mile 
apart. They came, in fact, from 
Mount Lookitthat’s two slowboats, 
and the distance between them was 
bridged by the sprawling structure 
of the Hospital, so that the space- 
craft were no longer spacecraft but 
odd looking towers in a sort of bunga- 
low-castle. But the ramrobot didn’t 
know that, and didn’t need to. 

There were signals. Ramrobot 
#143 started down. 

T he floor vibrated gently against 
the soles of his feet, and from 
all around came muted, steady thun- 
der. Jesus Pietro Castro strode down 
the twisting, intermeshing, labyrin- 
thine passages of the Hopsital. 

Though he was in a tearing hurry, 
it never occurred to him to run. He 
was not in the gymnasium, after all. 
Instead he moved like an elephant, 
who cannot run but who can walk 
fast enough to trample a running 
man. His head was down, his stride 
was as long as his legs could reach. 
His eyes looked ominously out from 
under prominent brow ridges and 
bushy white eyebrows. His bandit’s 
mustache and his full head of hair 
were also white and bushy, forming 
a startling contrast to his swarthy 
skin. Implementation police sprang to 
attention as he passed, snapping out 
of his way with the speed of pedes- 
trians dodging a bus. Was it his 
rank they feared, or his massive, un- 
stoppable bulk? Perhaps even they 
didn’t know. 

At the great stone arch which was 



SLOWBOAT CARGO 



13 




the main entrance to the Hospital, 
Jesus Pietro looked up to see a 
sparkling blue-white star overhead. 
Even as he found it it winked out. 
Moments later the all-pervading thun- 
der died away. 

A Jeep was waiting for him. If 
he’d had to call for one, someone 
would have been very sorry. He 
got in, and the Implementation 
chauffeur took off at once, without 
waiting for orders. The Hospital fell 
behind, with its walls and its sur- 
rounding wasteland of defenses. 

The ramrobot package was float- 
ing down on its parachutes. 

Other cars were in flight, erratical- 
ly shifting course as their drivers 
tried to guess where the white dot 
would come down. It would be near 
the Ho^ital, of course. The ramrobot 
would have aimed for one or another 
of the ships; and the Hospital had 
grown like something living, like a 
growth of architectural coral, between 
the two former spacecraft. 

But the wind was strong today. 

Jesus Pietro frowned. The para- 
chute would be blown over the edge 
of the cliff. It would end, not on 
Alpha Plateau, where the crew built 
their homes and where no colonist 
could be tolerated, but in the colon- 
ist regions beyond. 

It did. The cars swooped after it 
like a flock of geese, following it over 
the four-hundred-foot cliff that 
separated Alpha Plateau from Beta 
Plateau, where forests of fruit trees 
alternated with fields of grain and 
vegetables and meadows where cattle 
grazed. There were no homes on 
Beta, for the crew did not like colon- 
ists so close. But colonists worked 



there and often they played there. 

Jesus Pietro picked up his phoneii 
"‘Orders,” he said. "‘Ramrobot pack- 
age forty-three is landing in Beta, 
sector . twenty-two or thereabouts. 
Send four squads in after us. Do not 
under any circumstances interfere 
with cars or crew, but arrest any 
colonist you find within half a mile 
of the package. Hold them for ques- 
tioning only. And get out here fast.” 
The package skimmed over half 
an acre of citrus trees and came 
down at the far edge. 

I t was a grove of lemon and orange 
trees. One of the later ramrobot 
packages had carried the grove’s 
genetically altered ancestors, along 
with other miracles of terrestrial 
biological engineering. These trees 
would not harbor any parasites at 
all. They would grow anywhere. They 
would not compete for growth with 
other, similarly altered citrus trees. 
Their fruit remained precisely ripe 
for ten months out of the year, and 
when they dropped the fruit to re- 
lease the seeds it was at staggered in- 
tervals, so that at any time five trees 
out of six held ripe fruit. 

In their grim need for sunlight the 
trees had spread their leaves and 
branches into an opaque curtain, so 
that being in the grove was like being 
in a virgin forest. Mushrooms grew 
here, imported unchanged from Earth. 

Polly had already picked a couple 
of dozen. If anyone had asked, she 
had gone into the citrus woods to 
pick mushrooms. 

By the time her hypothetical ques- 
tioner arrived, she would have hid- 
den her camera.

IF 




Considering that the tending sea- 
son was a month away, a remark- 
able number of colonists were aboard 
on Beta Plateau. In woods, on the 
plains, climbing cliffs for exercise . 
hundreds of men and women were on 
excursions and picnics. An alert Im- 
plementation officer would have 
found their distribution improbably 
even. Too many would have been 
recognized as Sons of Earth. 

But the ramrobot package chose 
to land in Polly’s area. 

She was near the edge of the woods 
when she heard the thump. She 
moved swiftly but quietly in that di- 
rection. With her black hair and 
darkly tanned skin she was nearly in- 
visible in the forest dusk. She 
crawled between two tree trunks, 
moved behind another and peered 
out. 

A large cylindrical object lay on 
the grass beyond. A string of five 
parachutes writhed, away before the 
wind. 

So thafs what they look likCy she 
thought. It seemed so small to have 
come so far . but it must be only 
a tiny portion of the total ramrobot. 
The major portion would be on its 
way home. 

But it was the package that count- 
ed. The contents of a ramrobot pack- 
age were never trivial. For six 
months, ever since the maser message 
arrived, the Sons of Earth had been 
planning to capture ramrobot capsule 
#143. At worst they could ransom 
it to the crew. At best, it might be 
something to fight with. 

She almost stepped out of the 
woods before she saw the cars. 

At least thirty of them, landing 



all around the ramrobot package. 
She stayed hidden. 

H is soldiers would not have recog- 
nized Jesus Pietro Castro’s be- 
havior now, but they would have un- 
derstood it. All but two or three of 
the men and women around him were 
purebred crew. Their chauffeurs, in- 
cluding his own, had prudently stay- 
ed in their cars. Jesus Pietro Castro 
was obsequious, deferential and very 
careful not to joggle an elbow or to 
step on a toe or even to find him- 
self in somebody’s path. 

As a result his vision was block- 
ed when Millard Parlette, a lineal 
descendant of the first Captain of 
the Plancky opened the capsule and 
reached in. He did see what the anci- 
ent held up to the sunlight, the bet- 
ter to examine it. 

It was a rectangular solid with 
rounded edges, and it had been pack- 
ed in a resilient material which was 
now disintegrating. The bottom half 
was metal. The top was' a remote 
descendant of glass, hard as the cheap- 
er steel alloys, more transparent than 
a window pane. And in the top half 
floated — something shapeless. 

Jesus Pietro felt his mouth fall 
open. He looked harder. His eyelids 
squinted, his pupils dilated. Yes, he 
knew what this was. It was what the 
maser message had promised six 
months ago. 

A great gift, and a great danger. 
“This must be our most carefully 
guarded secret,” Millard Parlette was 
saying in a voice like a squeaky door. 
“No word must ever leak out. If 
the colonists saw this they’d blow 
it out of all proportion. We’ll have to

teU Castro to — Castro! Where the 
Mist Demons is Castro?” 

“Here I am, sir.” 

P olly fitted the camera back in its 
case and began to work her way 
deeper into the woods. She’d taken 
several pictures, and two were tele- 
scopic shots of the thing in the glass 
case. Her eyes hadn’t seen it clearly, 
but the film would show it in de- 
tail. 

She went up a tree with the camera 
about her neck. The leaves and 
branches tried to push her back, 
but she fought through, deeper and 
deeper into the protecting leaves. 
When she stopped there was hardly a 
square inch of her that didn’t feel the 
gentle pressure. It was dark as the 
caves of Pluto. 

In a few minutes the police would 
be all through here. They would wait 
only until the crew was gone before 
converging on this area. It was not 
enough that Polly be invisible. There 
must be enough leaves to block any 
infrared light leaving her body. 

She could hardly blame herself for 
losing the capsule. The Sons of 
Earth had been unable to translate 
the maser message, but the crew had. 
They knew the capsule’s worth. But 
so did Polly — now. When the 
eighteen thousand colonists of Mount 
Lookitthat knew what was in that 
capsule .... 

Night came. The Implementation 
police had collected all the colonists 
they could find. None of them had 
seen the capsule after it came down, 
and all would be released after ques- 
tioning. Now the police spread out 
with infrared detectors. There were 



several spots of random heat in Pol- 
ly’s grove, and all were sprayed with 
sonic stunners. Polly never knew 
she’d been hit. When she woke next 
morning she was relieved to find her- 
self still in her perch. She waited un- 
til high noon, then moved toward 
-the Beta-Gamma Bridge with her 
camera hidden under the mushrooms. 

Ill 

F rom the bell tower of Campbell- 
town came four thunderous ring- 
ing notes. The sonic wave fronts 
marched out of town in order, cross- 
ing fields and roads, diminishing as 
they came. They overran the mine 
with hardly a pause. But men look- 
ed up, lowering their tools. 

Matt smiled for the first time that 
day. Already he could taste cold 
beer. 

The bicycle ride from the mine 
was all downhill. He reached Czil- 
ler’s as the place was beginning to fill 
up. He ordered a pitcher, as usual, 
and downed the first glass without 
drawing breath. A kind of bliss settled 
on him, and he poured his second 
glass carefully down the side to avoid 
a head. He sat sipping it while more 
and more freed workmen poured into 
the taproom. 

Tomorrow was Saturday. For two 
days and three nights he could for- 
get the undependable little beasties 
who earned him his living. 

Presently an elbow hit him in the 
neck. He ignored it: a habit his an- 
cestors had brought from crowded 
Earth and retained. But the second 
time the elbow polled him he had the 
glass to his lips. With beer dripping 



16 



IF 




wetly down his neck, he turned to 
deliver a mild reproof. 

“Sorry,” said a short, dark man 
with straight black hair. He had a 
thin, expressionless face and the air 
of a tired clerk. Matt looked more 
closely. 

“Hood,” he said. 

“Yes, my name is Hood. But I 
don’t recognize you.” The man put a 
question in his voice. 

Matt grinned, for he like^ flambo- 
yant gestures. He wrapped his fingers 
in his collar and pulled his shirt open 
to the waist. “Try again,” he in- 
vited. 

The clerkish type shied back, and 
then his eyes caught the tiny scar on 
Matt’s chest. 

“Keller.” 

“Right,” said Matt, and zipped his 
shirt up. 

“Keller. I’ll be d-damned,” said 
Hood. You could tell somehow that 
he saved such words for emergencies. 
“It’s been at least seven years. What 
have you been doing lately?” 

“Grab that seat.” Hood saw his 
opportunity and was into the stool 
next to Matt before he occupant was 
fully out of it. “I’ve been playing 
nursemaid to mining worms. And 
you?” 

Hood’s smile suddenly died. “Er — 
you don’t still hold that scar against 
me, do you?” 

“No!” Matt said with explosive sin- 
cerity. “That whole thing was my 
fault. Anyway it was a long time 
ago.” 

It was. Matt had been in the eighth 
grade that fall day when Hood came 
into Matt’s classroom to borrow the 
pencil sharpener. It was the first 

SLOWBOAT CARGO 



time he’d ever seen Hood — a boy 
about Matt’s size, though obviously 
a year older, an undersized, very 
nervous upper classman. Unfortunate^ 
ly the teacher was out of the room. 
Hood had marched the full length of 
the room, not looking at anyone, 
sharpened his pencil, and turned to 
find his escape blocked by a mob 
of yelling, bounding eighth graders. 
To Hood, a new arrival at the school, 
they must have looked like a horde 
of cannibals. And in the forefront was 
Matt, using a chair in the style of an 
animal trainer. 

Exit Hood, running, wild with ter- 
ror. He had left the ^arpened point 
of his pencil in Matt’s chest. 

It was one of the few times Matt 
had acted the bully. To him the scar 
was a badge of shame. 

“Good,” said Hood, his relief 
showing. “So you’re a miner now?” 
“Right, and regretting it every 
waking hour. I rue the day Earth 
sent us those little snakes.”” 

“It must be better than digging 
the holes yourself.” 

“Think so? Are you ready for a 
lecture?” 

“Just a second.” Hood drained 
his glass in a heroic gesture. “Ready.” 
“A mining worm is five inches 
long and a quarter inch in diameter, 
mutated from an earthworm. Its 
grinding orifice is rimmed with little 
diamond teeth. It ingests metal ores 
for pleasure, but for food it has to 
be supplied with blocks of synthetic 
stuff which is different for each breed 
of worm — and there’s a breed for 
every metal. This makes things com- 
plicated. We’ve got six breeds out at 
the mine site, and I’ve got to see 

17 




that each breed always has a food 
block within reach.** 

*‘lt doesn*t sound too complicated. 
Can’t they find their own food?” 

**ln theory, sure. In practice, not 
always. But that’s not all. What 
brea^ down the ores is a bacterium 
in the worm’s stomach. Then the 
worm drops metal grains around its 
food block, ^and we sweep it up. 
Now, that bacterium dies very easily. 
If the bacterium dies, so does the 
worm, because there’s metal ore 
blocking his intestines. Then the other 
worms eat his body to recover the 
ore. Only, five times out of six it’s 
the wrong ore.” 

“The worms can’t tell each other 
apart?” 

“Flaming right they can’t. They 
eat the wrong metals, they eat the 
wrong worms, they eat the wrong 
food blocks, and when they do every- 
thing right they still die in ten days. 
They were biiilt that way because 
their teeth wear out so fast. They’re 
supposed to breed like mad to com- 
pensate, but the plain truth is they 
don’t have time when they’re on the 
job. We have to keep going back to 
the crew for more.” 

“So they’ve got you by the 
gonads.” 

“Sure. They charge what they 
like.” 

“Could they be putting the wrong 
chemical cues in some of the food 
blocks?” 

Matt looked up, startled. “I’ll bet 
that’s just what they’re doingl Or too 
little of the right cues; that’d save 
them money at the same time. They 
won’t let us grow our own, of course. 
The — *’ 



Matt swallowed the word. After 
all, he hadn’t seen Hood in years. 
The crew didn’t like being called 
names. 

‘Time for dinner,” said Hood. 
They finished the beer and went 
to the town’s one restaurant Hood 
wanted to know what had happened 
to his old school friends — or school- 
mates; Hood had not made friends 
easily. Matt, who knew in many cases, 
obliged. They talked shop, both pro- 
fessions. Hood was teaching school 
on Delta. To Matt’s surprise, the in- 
troverted boy had become an enter- 
taining storj^ller. He had kept his 
dry, precise tone, and it only made 
his jokes funnier. They were both 
fairly good at their jobs, and both 
mal^g enough money to live on. 
There was no real poverty anywhere 
on the Plateau. It was not the colon- 
ists’ money the crew wanted, as Hood 
pointed out over the meat course. 

“I know where there’s a party,” 
Hood said over coffee. 

“Are we invited?” 

“Yes.” 

Matt had nothing planned for the 
night, but he wanted reassurance. 
“Party crashers welcome?” 

“In your case, party crashers so- 
licited. You’ll like Harry Kane. He’s 
the host.” 

“I’m sold.” 

T he sun dipped below the edge of 
Gamma Plateau as they rode up. 
They left their bicycles in back of 
the house. As they walked around 
to the front the sun showed again, a 
glowing red half-disk above the eter- 
nal sea of cloud beyond the void edge. 
Harry Kane’s house was just forty 



18 



IF 




yards from the edge. They stopped a 
m6ment to watch the sunset fade, 
then turned toward the house. 

It was a great sprawling bungalow, 
laid out in a rough cross, with the 
bulging walls typical of architectural 
coral. No attempt had been made to 
disguise its origin. Matt had never 
before seen a house which was not 
painted, but he had to admire the 
effect. The remnants of the shaping 
balloon, which gave all architectural 
coral buildings their telltale bulge, had 
been carefully scraped away. The ex- 
posed walls had been polished to a 
shining pink sheen. Even after sun- 
set the house glowed softly. 

As if it were proud of its thorough- 
ly colonist origin. 

Architectural coral was another 
gift of the ramrobots. A genetic mani- 
pulation of ordinary sea coral, it was 
the cheapest building material known. 
The only real cost was in the plastic 
balloon which guided the growth of 
the coral and which enclosed the 
coral’s special airborne food. All 
colonists lived in buildings of coral. 
Not many would have built in stone 
or wood or brick even were it allowed. 
But most attempted to make their 
dwellings look somewhat like those 
on Alpha Plateau. With paint, with 
wood and metal and false stone sid- 
ings, with powered sandpaper disks to 
flatten the inevitable bulges, they 
tried to imitate the crew. 

In daylight or darkness, Harry 
Kane’s house was flagrantly atypical. 

The noise hit them as they open- 
ed the door. Matt stood still while 
his ears adjusted to the noise level — 
a survival trait his ancestors had de- 
veloped when Earth’s population 

SLOWBOAT CARGO 



numbered nineteen billion, even as it 
did that ni^t, deven point nine li^it- 
years away. During the last four cen- 
turies, a man of Barth might as well 
have been stone deaf if he could not 
carry on a conversation with a thou- 
sand drunks bellowing in his ears. 
Matt’s people had kept some of their 
habits too. The great living room was 
jammed, and the few chairs were 
largely being ignored. 

The room was big, and the bar 
across from the entrance was enor- 
mous. Matt shouted, “Harry Kane 
must do a lot of entertaining.” 

“He does! Come with me, we’ll 
meet himi” 

Matt caught snatches of conver- 
sation as they pushed their way 
across the room. The party hadn’t 
been going long, he gathered, and 
several people knew practically no- 
body; but they all had drinks. They 
were of all ages, all professions. 
Hood had spoken true. If a party 
crasher weren’t welcome, he’d never 
know it, because no one would recog- 
nize him as one. 

The walls were like the outside, a 
glowing coral pink. The floor, cover- 
ed with a hairy-looking wall-to-wall 
rug of mutated grass, was flat except 
at the walls; no doubt it had been 
sanded flat after the house was fin- 
ished and the forming balloon re- 
moved. But Matt knew that beneath 
the rug was not tiles or hardwood, 
but the ever-present pink coral. 

T hey reached the bar, no more 
jostled than need be. Hood lean- 
ed across the bar as far as he could, 
which because of his height was not 
far, and called, “Harry! Two vodka 

19 




sodas, and I’d like you to meet — 
Dammit, Keller, what’s your first 
name?” 

“Matt.” 

“Matt Keller. We’ve known each 
other since grade school.” 

“Pleasure, Matt,” said Harry 
Kane, and reached over to shake 
hands. “Glad to see you here. Jay.” 
Harry was almost Matt’s height, and 
considerably broader, and his wide 
face was dominated by a shapeless 
nose and an even wider grin. He 
looked exactly like a bartender. He 
poured the vodka-sodas into glasses 
in which water had been pre-frozen. 
He handed them across. “Enjoy your- 
selves,” he said, and moved down 
the bar to serve two newcomers. 

Hood said, “Harry believes the 
best way to meet everyone right 
away is to play bartender for the 
first couple of hours. Afterward he 
turns the job over to a volunteer.” 

“Good thinking,” said Matt. “Is 
your name Jay?” 

“Short for Jayhawk. Jayhawk 
Hood. One of my ancestors was from 
Kansas. The jayhawk was a symbolic 
Kansas bird.” 

“Crazy, isn’t it, that we needed 
eight years to learn each others’ 
first names?” 

At that moment a fragment of the 
crowd noticed Hood and swept down 
upon them. Hood had barely time to 
grin in answer before they were in 
the midst of introductions. Matt was 
relieved. He was sure he had seen 
Harry Kane pass something to “Jay” 
Hood along with his drink. Manners 
kept him from asking questions, but 
it stuck in his curiosity, and he want- 
ed to forget it. 



The newcomers were four men and 
a woman. As an individual Matt r^ 
membered only the woman. 

Her name was Laney Mattson. She 
was around twenty-six years old, five 
years older than Matt. In bare feet 
he would have topped her by a scant 
half inch. But she was wearing dou- 
ble-spikes, and her piled confection 
of auburn hair made her even taller. 
Not merely tall, she was big, with 
wide pronounced hips and deep 
breasts behind an “M” neckline. She 
looked prettier than she was, Matt 
thought; she used cosmetics well. 
And there was a booming exuberance 
in her every act, an enjoyment as 
big as herself. 

The men were her age and over, 
in their late twenties. Any of the 
four would have looked normal danc- 
ing with Laney. They were huge. 
Matt retained of them only a com- 
posite impression of a resonant voice 
and an enveloping handclasp and a 
great handsome face smiling down 
from the pink ceiling. Yet he lik^ 
them all. He just couldn’t tell them 
apart. 

Hood surprised him again. Talk- 
ing along in his dry voice, keeping it 
raised to an audible bellow, not 
straining his neck to look anyone in 
the face. Hood somehow kept con- 
trol of the conversation. It was he 
who guided the talk to school days. 
One of the tall men was moved to 
speak of a simple trick he’d used to 
rewire his school’s teaching teedee, 
so that for one day he and his class- 
mates had watched their lessons both 
upside down and inside out. Matt 
found himself telling of the specimen 
bottle of apple juice he’d sneaked into 

IF 



20 




the medcheck station^ and 

what he did with it. Someone who’d 
been listening politely from the edge 
of the circle mentioned that once he’d 
stolen a car from a picnicking crew 
family on Beta Plateau. He’d set the 
autopilot to circle a constant thou- 
sand feet beyond the void edge. It 
had stayed up for five days before 
dropping into the mist, with scores 
of Implementation police watching. 

Matt watched Jay Hood and 
Laney as they talked. Laney had a 
long arm draped over Hood’s shoul- 
ders, and the top of his head reach- 
ed her chin. They were both talking 
at once, trampling the taU ends of 
each others’ sentences, racing pellmell 
through memories and anecdotes and 
jokes they’d been saving, sharing 
them with the group but talking for 
each other. 

It wasn’t love. Matt decided, 
hough it was like love. It was an 
mmense satisfaction Hood and Laney 
elt at knowing each other. Satis- 
action and pride. It made Matt feel 
onely. 

Gradually Matt became aware that 
^aney was wearing a hearing aid. 

It was so small and so cunningly 
colored as to be nearly invisible with- 
in her ear. Truthfully, Matt couldn’t 
swear that it was there. 

If Laney needed a hearing aid, it 
was too bad she couldn’t hide it 
better. For centuries more civilized 
peoples had been wearing specks of 
l^aminated plastic buried in the skin 
above the mastoid bone. Such things 
did not exist on Mount Lookitthat. A 
crew, now, would have had his ears 
replaced from the organ banks .... 

Glasses went empty, and one of 



Laney’s big escorts came back mth 
replacements. The little group grew 
and shrank and split into other groups 
with the eternal capriciousness of the 
cocktail party. For a moment Matt 
and Jay . Hood were left standing 
alone in a forest of backs and el- 
bows. Hood said, “Want to meet a 
beautiful girl?” 

Hood turned to lead the way, and 
Matt caught a flash of the same odd 
coloring in his ear that he had no- 
ticed in Laney’s. Since when had 
Hood become hard of hearing? It 
might have been imagination, aided 
by vodka-sodas. For one thing, the 
tiny instruments seemed too deeply 
embedded to be removed. 

But an item that size could have 
been just what Harry Kane passed to 
Jay Hood along with his drink.

A raid, sir.” Jesus Pietro sat 
deferentially forward in his chair, 
hands folded on his desk, the very 
image of the highly intelligent man 
dedicated solely to his work. “We’ll 
pick them up outside the house. If 
they stop coming out, we’ll know 
they’ve caught on. Then we’ll go 
into the house itself.” 

Behind the mask of deference, 
Jesus Pietro was annoyed. For the 
first time in four years he had 
planned a major raid on the Sons 
of Earth, and Millard Parlette had 
picked that night to visit the Hos- 
pital. Why tonight? He came only 
once in two months, thank the Mist 
Demons. A visit from a crew always 
upset Jesus Pietro’s men. 



SLOWBOAT CARGO 



21 




At least Parlette had come to him. 
Once Parlette had summoned him to 
his own house, and that had been 
bad. Here, Jesus Pietro was in his 
element. Jffis office was practically 
an extension of his personality. The 
desk had the shape of a boomerang, 
enclosing him in an obtuse angle for 
more available working space. He had 
three guests’ chairs of varying degrees 
of comfort, for crew and Hospital 
persoimel and colonist. The office 
was big and square, but there was a 
slight curve to the back wall. Where 
the other walls were cream colored, 
easy on the eye, the back wall was 
smoothly polished dark metal. 

It was part of the outer hull of 
the Planck, Jesus Pietro’s office was 
right up against the source of half the 
spiritual strength of Mount Lookit- 
that, and half the electrical power 
too: the ship that had brought men to 
this world. Sitting at his desk, Jesus 
Pietro felt the power at his back. 

"Our only problem,” he continued 
smoothly, "is that not all of Kane’s 
guests are involved in the conspira- 
cy. At least half will be deadheads 
invited for camouflage. Telling them 
apart will take time.” 

"I see that,” said the old man. 

His voice squeaked. He wore the tall, 
skeletal look of a Don Quixote, but 
his eyes held no madness. They were 
sane and alert. For nearly two hun- 
dred years the Hospital had kept his 
body, brain and mind functioning. 
Probably even he did not know how 
much of him had been borrowed 

from colonists convicted of major 

crimes. "Why tonight?” he asked. 

"WTiy not, sir?” Jesus Pierto saw 
what he was driving at, and his mind 



raced. Millard Parlette was nobody’s 
fool. The ancient was one of the few 
crew willing to accept any kind of 
responsibility. Most of the thirty 
thousand crew on Mount Lookitthat 
preferred to devise ever more com- 
plex forms of playing: sports, styles 
of dress which changed according to 
half a dozen complex, fluctuating 
sets of rules, rigid and ridiculous so- 
cial forms. Parlette preferred to work 
— sometimes. He had chosen to 
rule the Hospital. He was competent 
and quick; though he appeared rare- 
ly, he always seemed to know what 
was happening; and he was difficult 
to lie to. 

Now he said, "Yesterday the 
ramrobot capsule. Last night your 
men were scouring the area for spies. 
Tonight you plan a major raid for 
the first time in four years. Do you 
think someone slipped through your 
fingers?” 

“No, sir!” But that would not satis- 
fy Parlette. “But in this instance I 
can afford to cover my bet even when 
it’s a sure thing. If a colonist had 
news of the ramrobot package, he’d 
be at Kane’s place tonight though 
demons bar the way.”” 

“I den‘t approve of gamblings” 
said Parlette. Jesus Pietro uneasily 
searched his mind for a suitable 
answer. “And you have chosen not 
to gamble. Very good, Castro. Now. 
What has been done with the ram- 
robot capsule?” 

“I think the organ bank people 
have it unpacked, sir. And the . 
contents stored. Would you like to 
see?” 

“Yes.” 

Jesus Pietro Castro, Head of Tm-

pletonentation, the only armed authori- 
ty on an entire world, rose hastily 
to his feet to act as guide. If they 
hurried, he might get away in time 
to supervise the raid. But there was 
no polite way to make a crew hurry. 

H ood had spoken true. Polly 
Tournquist was beautiful. She 
was also small and dark and quiet, 
and Matt definitely wanted to toow 
her better. Polly had long, soft hair 
the color of a starless night, direct 
brown eyes, and a smile that came 
through even when she was trying 
to look serious. She looked like 
someone with a secret. Matt thought. 
She didn’t talk; she listened. 

“Parapsychological abilities are not 
a myth,” Hood was insisting. “When 
the Planck left Earth there were all 
kinds of psionics devices for ampli- 



fying them. Telepathy had gotten al- 
most dependable. They — ” 
“What’s ‘almost dependable?*” 
“Dependable enough so there were 
specially trained people to read dol- 
phin minds. Enough so telepaths were 
called as expert witnesses in mur- 
der trials. Enough — ” 

“All right, all right,” said Matt. 
It was the first time tonight that 
he had seen Hood worked up. Matt 
gathered from the attitudes of others 
that Hood rode this hobby horse 
often. He asked, “Where are they 
now, these witches of yours?” 

“They aren’t witches! Look, Kell 
— Look, Matt. Every one of those 
psi powers was tied up a little bit 
with telepathy. They proved that. 
Now, do you know how they tested 
our ancestors before they sent them 
into space for a long one-way trip?” 




Someone played straight man. 
“They had to orbit Earth for awhile.” 
“Yes. Four candidates in a ferry 
boat, orbiting for one month. No 
telepath could take that.” 

Polly Toumquist was following the 
debate like a spectator at a tennis 
msttch, swinging her shoulders to face 
whoever was speaking. Her grin 
widened; her hair swung gently, 
hypnotically; she was altogether a 
pleasure to watch. She knew Matt 
w^ watching. Occasionally her eyes 
would flick toward him as if inviting 
him to share the joke. 

“Why not, if he’s got company?” 
“The wrong company. Anywhere 
on Earth a latent telepath is sur- 
rounded by tens of thousands of 
minds. In space he has three. And 
he can’t get away from any of them 
for a single hour, ior a full month.” 
“How do you know all this, Jay? 
Books? You damn sure don’t have 
anyone to experiment on.” 

Polly’s eyes sparkled as she fol- 
lowed the debate. The lobes of 
Hood’s ears were turning red. Pol- 
ly’s raven hair swung wide . and 
when it uncovered her right ear for 
an instant, she was almost certainly 
wearing a tiny, almost invisible hear- 
ing aid. 

So she did have a secret. And, 
finally, Matt thought he knew what 
it was. 

T hree hundred years ago the 
Planck had come to Mount 
Lookitthat, with six crew members to 
guard fifty passengers in suspended 
animation. The story was in all the 
history tapes, of how the circular fly- 
ing wing had dipped into the atmo- 



sphere and flown for hours abijve 
impenetrable mists which the instSfU- 
ments showed to be poisonous and 
deadly hot. And then a great mass 
had come over the horizon, a verti- 
cal flat-topped mountain forty miles 
high and hundreds of miles long. It 
was like a new continent rearing 
over the impalpable white sea. The 
crew had gaped, wordless, until Cap- 
tain Parlette had said, “Lookitthat!” 

Unwritten, but thoroughly known, 
was the story of the landing. The 
passengers had been wakened one at 
a time, to find themselves living in 
an instant dictatorship. Those who 
fought the idea, and they were few, 
died. When the Arthur Clarke came 
down forty years later, the pattern 
was repeated. The situation had not 
changed but for population growth, 
not in the last three hundred years. 

From the beginning there had been 
a revolutionary group. Its name had 
changed several times, and Matt had 
no idea what it was now. He had 
never known a revolutionary. He had 
no particular desire to be one. They 
accomplished nothing except to fill 
the Hospital’s organ banks. How 
could they, when the crew controlled 
every weapon and every watt of 
power on Mount Lookitthat? 

If this was a nest of rebels then 
they had worked out a good cover. 
Many of the merrymakers had no 
hearing aids, and these seemed to be 
the ones who didn’t know anyone 
here. Like Matt himself. In the midst 
of a reasonably genuine open-house 
brawl, certain people listened to 
voices only they could hear. 

Matt let his imagination play. 
They’d have an escape hatch some- 



24 



IF 




where, those of the inner circle, and 
if the police showed they would use 
it during a perfectly genuine panic. 
Matt and his brethren of the outer 
circle would be expendable .... 

“But why should all of these oc- 
cult powers be connected to mind 
reading? Does that make sense to 
you. Jay?” 

“Certainly. Don’t you see that 
telepathy is a survival trait? When 
human beings evolved psi powers, 
they must have evolved telepathy 
first. All the others came later, be- 
cause they’re less likely to get you 
out of a bad situation . .” 

Matt dismissed the idea of leav- 
ing. Safer? Sure. But here he had, 
for a time, escaped from his persnick- 
ety minin g forms and their venal 
crewish growers and the multiple 
other problems that made his life 
what it was. And his curiosity bump 
itched madly. He wanted to know 
how they thought, how they worked, 
how they protected themselves, what 
they had in mind. He wanted to 
know .... 

He wanted to know Polly Tourn- 
quist. Now more than ever. She was 
small and lovely and delicate looking, 
and every man who had ever looked 
at her must have wanted to protect 
her. What was such a girl doing 
throwing her life away? Really, that 
was all she was doing. Sooner or 
later the organ banks would run 
short of healthy livers or live skin 
or lengths of large intestine, at a 
time when there was a dearth of 
crime on the Plateau. Then Imple- 
mentation would throw a raid, and 
Polly would be stripped down to her 
component parts. 



Matt had a sudden urge to talk 
her out of it, get her to leave here 
with him and move to another part 
of the Plateau. Would they be able 
to hide out in a region so limited? 

Possibly not, but — 

But she didn’t even know he’d 
guessed. If she found out, he could 
die for his knowledge. He’d have to 
put a failsafe on his mouth. 

It spoiled things. If Matt could 
have played the observer, the man 
who watched and said nodiing .... 
But he wasn’t an observer. He was 
involved now. He knew Jay and 
liked him; he’d liked Laney Mattson 
and Harry Kane at sight, and he 
could have fallen in love with Polly 
Tournquist. These people were put- 
ting their lives on the line. And his, 
too! And he could do nothing about 
it. 

The middle-aged man with the 
brush cut was still at it. “Jay,” he 
said with a poor imitation of pati- 
ence, “you’re trying to tell us that 
Earth had psi powers under good 
control when the founding fathers 
left. Well, what have they done since? 
They’ve made all kinds of progress 
in biological engineering. Their ships 
improve constantly. Now the ram- 
robots go home all by themselves. 
But what have they done about psi 
powers? Nothing. Just nothing. And 
why?” 

“Because — ” 

“Because it’s all superstition. 
Witchcraft, Myths.” 

Oh, shut up. Matt thought. It was 
all cover for what was reaUy going 
on; and he wasn’t a part of that. He 
dropped back out of the circle, hop- 
ing nobody would notice him . •

except Polly. Nobody did. He eased 
toward the bar for a refill. 

Harry Kane was gone, replaced by 
a kid somewhat younger than Matt, 
one who wouldn’t last another half 
hour if he kept sampling his own 
wares. When Matt tasted his drink 
it was mostly vodka. And when he 
turned around, there was Polly, 
laughing at his puckered face. 

T he half-dozen suspects were deep- 
‘ly asleep along one wall of the 
patrol wagon. A white-garbed Imple- 
mentation medic looked up as Jesus 
Pietro ^tered. “Oh, there you are, 
sir. I think these three must be dead- 
heads. The others had mechanisms 
in their ears.” 

The night outside was as black as 
always on moonless Mount Lookit- 
that. Jesus Pietro had left Millard 
Parlette standing before the glass 
wall of the organ banks, contemplat- 
ing .. whatever he might be con- 
templating. Eternal life? Not likely. 
Even Millard Parlette, one hundred 
and ninety years old, would die when 
his central nervous system wore out. 
You couldn’t transplant brains with- 
out transplanting memories. What 
had Parlette been thinking? His ex- 
pression had been very odd. 

Jesus Pietro took a suspect’s head 
in his hands and rolled it to look 
in the ears. The body rolled too, 
limply, passively. “I don’t see any- 
thing.” 

“When we tried to remove the 
mechanism it evaporated. So did the 
old woman’s. This girl still has hers.” 
“Good.” He bent to look. Far 
down in the left ear, too deep for 
fingers to reach it, was something 



colored dead black with a rim ,?of 
fleshy pink. He said, “Get a micro- 
phone.” 

The man made a call. Jesus Pietro 
waited impatiently for someone to 
bring a mike. Someone eventually 
did. Jesus Pietro held it against the 
girl’s head and turned the sound up 
high. 

Rustling sounds came in an ampli- 
fied crackle. 

“Tape it on,” said Jesus Pietro. The 
medic stretched the girl on her side 
and taped the mike against her head. 
The thunder of rustling stopped, and 
the interior of the wagon was full of 
the deep drumbeat sound of her ar- 
teries. 

“How long since anybody left the 
meeting?” 

“That was these two, sir. About 
twenty minutes.” 

The door in back opened to admit 
two men and two women, uncon- 
scious, on stretchers. One man had 
a hearing aid. 

“Obviously they don’t have ^ sig- 
nal to show they’re clear,” said Jesus 
Pietro. “Foolish.” Now, if he’d been 
running the Sons of Earth .... 

Come to think of it, he might 
send out decoys, expendable mem- 
bers. If the first few didn’t come 
back, he’d send out more, at random 
intervals, while the leaders escaped. 

Escaped where? His men had 
found no exit routes; the sonics re- 
ported no tunnels underground. 

It was seconds before Jesus Pietro 
noticed that the mike was speaking. 
The sounds were that low. Quickly 
he put his ear to the loudspeaker. 

“Stay until you feel like leaving, 
then leave. Remember, this is an 



26 



IF 




ordinary party, open-house style. 
However, those of you who have 
nothing important to say should be 
gone by midnight. Those who wish 
to speak to me shuld use the usual 
channels. Remember not to try to re- 
move the earpieces; they will disin- 
tegrate of themselves at six o’clock. 
Now enjoy yourselves!” 

“What’d he say?” asked the music. 
“Nothing important. I wish I could 
be sure that was Kane.” Jesus Pietro 
nodded briefly at the medic and the 
two cops. “Keep it up,” he said, and 
stepped out into the night. 

V 

4 4TX7hy’d you leave? It was just 
▼ V getting interesting.” 

“No, it wasn’t, and my glass was 
empty, and anyway I was hoping 
you’d follow.” 

PoUy laughed. “You must believe 
in miracles.” 

“True. Why’d you leave?” 
Embedded in wall-to-wall humani- 
ty, drowned in a waterfall of human 
voices, Polly and Matt nevertheless 
had a sort of privacy. Manners and 
lack of interest would prevent anyone 
from actually listening to them. 
Hence nobody could hear them; for 
how could anyone concentrate on two 
conversations at once? They might 
have been in a room by themselves, 
a room with yielding walls and un- 
yielding elbows, a room as small and 
private as a phone booth. 

“I think Jay’s bugs on psi powers,” 
said Polly. She had not answered his 
question, which was fine by Matt. 
He’d expected to escape unnoticed 
from Hood’s debate. He was lucky 



that way. But Polly coming to join 
him was new and different, and he 
enjoyed guessing at her motives. 

“He talks like that all the time?” 

“Yes. He thinks if we could 
only — ” She stopped. Girl with a 
secret. “Forget Jay. Tell me about 
yourself.” 

So he talked of mining worms 
and home life and the school in sec- 
tor nine. Gamma Plateau; and he 
mentioned Uncle Matt, who died for 
being a rebel, but she ignored the 
bait. And Polly talked about growing 
up a hundred miles away, near the 
Colony University, and she described 
her job at the Delta Retransmitting 
Power Station, but she never mention- 
ed her hearing aid. 

“You look like a girl with a 
secret,” Matt said. “I think it must 
be the smile.” 

She moved closer to him, which 
was very close, and lowered her 
voice. “Can you keep a secret?” 

Matt smiled with one side of his 
mouth to show that he knew what 
was coming. She said it anyway. “So 
can I.” 

And that was that. But she didn’t 
move away. They smiled at each 
other from a distance of a couple of 
inches, nose to nose, momentarily 
content with a silence which, to an 
earlier man, would have sounded like 
the center of an air raid. She was 
lovely, Polly. Her face was a lure 
and a danger; her figure, small and 
lithe and woman shaped, rippled 
with a dancer’s grace beneath her 
loose green jumper. For the moment 
Matt looked silently into her eyes 
and felt very good. The moment 
passed, and they talked small talk.

The flow of the crowd carried 
them half across the room. Once they ■ 
pushed back to the bar for refills, 
then let the crowd caity them again. 
In the continuous roar there was 
something hypnotic, something that 
might have explained why the 
crowded-room drinking bout was 
more than half a thousand years old; 
for monotonous background noise 
has long been in hypnosis. Time 
ceased to exist. But there came a 
moment when Matt knew that he 
would ask Polly to go home with 
him, and she would accept. 

He didn’t get the chance. 

Something changed in Polly’s face. 
She seemed to be listening to some- 
ting only she could hear. The hear- 
ing aid? He was ready to pretend he 
hadn’t noticed, but he didn’t get that 
chance either. For suddenly Polly 
was moving away, disappearing into 
the crowd, not as if she were in any 
hurry, but as if she remembered 
something she ought to do, some 
niggling detail she might as well take 
care of now. Matt tried to follow her, 
but the sea of humanity closed be- 
hind her. 

T he hearing aid, he told himself. 

It called her. But he stayed by 
the bar, resisting the pressure that 
would have borne him away. He was 
getting very drunk now and glad of 
it. He didn’t believe it had been the 
hearing aid. The whole thing was too 
familiar. Too many girls had lost in- 
terest in him just as suddenly as 
Polly had. He was more than disap- 
pointed. It hurt. The vodka helped 
to kill the pain. 

About ten-thirty he went around 



to the other side of the bar. The 
kid playing bartender was happily 
drunk and glad to give up his place. 
Matt was gravely drunk. He dis- 
pensed drinks with dignity, being po- 
lite but not obsequious. The crowd 
was thinning now. This was bedtime 
for most of Mount Lookitthat. By 
now the sidewalks in most towns 
would have been rolled up and put 
away till dawn. These revolutionists 
must be a late-rising group. Matt 
served drinks automatically, but he 
wasn’t having any more himself. 

The vodka began to run low. And 
there wasn’t anything but vodka, 
vodka converted from sugar and 
water and air by one of Earth’s edu- 
cated bacteria. Let it run out. Matt 
thought viciously. He could watch the 
riot. 

He served somebody a vodka- 
grapefruit, as requested. But the hand 
with the drink did not vanish to make 
room for someone else. Slowly Matt 
realized that the hand belonged to 
Laney Mattson. “Hi,” he said. 

“Hi. Want a stand-in?” 

“Guess so.” 

Somebody changed places with 
him — one of Laney’s tall escorts 
— and Laney led him through the 
thinning ranks to a miraculously un- 
occupied sofa. Matt sank deep into 
it. The room would start to whirl 
if he closed his eyes, 

“Do you always get this looped?” 
“No. Something bugging me.” 
“Tell me?” 

He turned to look at her. Some- 
how his vodka-blurred eyes saw past 
Laney’s makeup, saw that her mouth 
was too wide and her green eyes 
were strangely large. But she wore a 



28 



IF 




slight smile of sympathetic curiosity. 

“Ever see a twenty-one-year-old 
virgin male?” He squinted to try to 
read her reaction. 

The comers of Laney’s mouth 
twisted strangely. “No.” She was try- 
ing not to laugh, he realized. He 
turned away. 

She askei “Lack of interest?” 

“No! Hellno.” 

“Then what?” 

“She forgets me.” Matt felt him- 
self sobering with time and the ef- 
fort of answering. “All of a sudden, 
the girl I’m chasing just — ” he 
gestured a little wildly — “forgets 
I’m around. I don’t know why.” 

“Stand up.” 

“Humph?” 

He felt her hand on his arm, pull- 
ing. He stood up. The room spun, 
and he realized that he wasn’t sober- 
ing; he’d just felt steadier sitting 
down. He followed the pull of her 
arm, relieved that he didn’t fall down. 
The next thing he knew, everything 
was pitch black. 

“Where are we?” 

No answer. He felt hands pull his 
shirt apart, hands with small sharp 
nails which caught in his chest hair. 
Then his pants dropped. “So this is 
it,” he said, in a tone of vast sur- 
prise. It sounded so damn silly that 
he wanted to cringe. 

“Don’t panic,” said Laney. “Mist 
Demons, you’re nervous! Come here. 
Don’t trip over anything.” 

He managed to walk out of his 
pants without falling. His knees 
bunyjed something. “Fall face down,” 
Laney commanded, and he did. He 
was face down on an airfoam mat- 
tress, rigidly tense. Hands that were 



stronger than they ought to be dug 
into the muscles of his neck and 
shoulders, kneading them like' dough. 
It felt wonderful. He lay there with 
his arms out like a swan diver, going 
utterly limp as knuckles ran down 
the sides of his vertebrae, as slender 
fingers pulled each separate tendon 
into a new shape. 

When he was good and ready he 
turned over and reached out. 

his left was a stack of photos 
a foot high. Before him, three 
photos, obviously candid shots. Jesus 
Pietro spread them out and looked 
them over. He wrote a name under 
one of them. The others rang no 
bell, so he shuffled them and put 
them on the big stack. Then he 
stood up and stretched. 

“Match these with the suspects 
we’ve already collected,” he told an 
aide. The man saluted, picked up the 
stack and left the flying office, mov- 
ing toward the patrol wagons. Jesus 
Pietro followed him out. 

Almost half of Harry Kane’s 
guests were now in patrol wagons. 
The photographs had been taken as 
they entered the front door earlier 
tonight. Jesus Pietro, with the phe- 
nomenal memory, had identified a 
good number of them. 

The night was cool and dark. A 
stiff breeze blew across the Plateau, 
carrying a smell of rain. 

Rain. 

Jesus Pietro looked up to see that 
half the sky was raggedly blotted out. 
He could imagine trying to conduct 
a raid in a pouring rainstorm. He 
didn’t like the idea. 

Back in his office, he turned the

29 




intercom to all-channeL *‘Now hear 
this,** he said conversationally. 
“Phase two is on. Now.” 

44T s everyone that nervous?” 

JL Laney chuckled softly. Now 
she could laugh, all she wanted, if 
she wanted. “Not that nervous. I 
think everyone must be a little afraid 
the first time.” 

“You?” 

“Sure. But Ben handled it right. 
Good man, Ben.” 

“Where is he now?” Matt felt a 
mild gratitude toward Ben. 

“He’s — he’^ gone.” Her tone told 
him to drop it. Matt guessed he’d 
been caught wearing a hearing aid 
or sometl^g. 

“Mind if I turn on a light?” 

“If you can find a switch,” said 
Laney, “you can turn it on.” 

She didn’t expect him to, not in 
pitch blackness in a strange room, 
but he did. He felt incredibly sober, 
and incredibly peaceful. He ran his 
eyes over her lying next to him, see- 
ing the angled ruin of her sculp- 
tured hairdo, remembering the touch 
of smooth warm skin, knowing he 
could touch her again at will. It was 
a power he’d never felt before. He 
said, “Very nice.” 

“Makeup smeared over forgettable 
face.” 

“Unforgettable face.” It was true, 
now. “No makeup over unforgetta- 
ble body.” 

“I should wear a mask, no 
clothes.” 

“You’d get more attention than 
you’d like.” 

She laughed hugely, and he rest- 
ed his ear over her navel to enjoy 

30 



the earthquake ripple of abdominal 
muscles. 

The rain came suddenly, beating 
against the thick coral walls. They 
stopped talking to listen. Suddenly 
Laney dug her fingers into his arm 
and whispered. “Raid.” 

She means Rain, Matt thought, 
turning to look at her. She was terri- 
fied, her eyes and nostrils and mouth 
all distended. She meant Raid! 
“You’ve got a way out, don’t you?” 
Laney shook her head. She was 
listening to unheard voices through 
the hearing aid. 

“But you must have a way out. 
Don’t worry, I don’t want to know 
about it. I’m in no danger.” Lan^y 
looked startled, and he said, “Sure, 
1 noticed the hearing aids. But it’s 
none of my business.” 

“Yes it is. Matt. You were in- 
vited here so we could get a look at 
you. All of us bring outsiders oc- 
casionally. Some get invited to join.” 
“Oh.” 

“I told the truth. There’s no way 
out. Implementation has ways of 
finding tunnels. But there is a hiding 
place.” 

“Good.” 

“We can’t reach it. Implementation 
is already in the house. They’ve filled 
it with sleepy gas. It should be seep- 
ing aroimd the door any minute.” 
“The windows?” 

“They’ll be waiting for us.” 

“We can try.” 

“Okay.” She was on her feet and 
getting into her dress. Nothing else. 
Matt wasted not even that much 
time. He swung a great marble ash 
tray against a window and followed 
it through, thanking the Mist Demons

that Mount Lookitthat couldn’t make 
unbreakable glass. 

Two pairs of hands closed on to 
arms before his feet cleared the win- 
dow. Matt kicked out and heard 
somebody say Whuff! In the comer 
of his eye Laney cleared the window 
and was running. Good, he’d hold 
their attention for her. He jerked at 
the grip on his arms. A meaty hand 
weighing a full ton smashed across 
to jaw. His knees buckled. A light 
shone in his eyes, and he shrank 
back. 

The light passed. Matt made one 
last frantic attempt to jerk loose and 
felt one arm come free. He swung 
it full around. The elbow smacked 
solidly into yielding meat and bone: 
an unmistakable, unforgettable sen- 
sation. And he was free, and he was 
running. 

Just once in his life he had hit 
someone like that. From the feel of 
it he must have smashed the man’s 
nose all over his face. If Implemen- 
tation caught him now . .! 

Wet, slippery, treacherous grass 
underfoot. Once he stepped on a 
smooth wet rock and went skidding 
across the grass on cheek and shoul- 
der. Twice a spotlight found him, and 
each time he hit the grass and lay 
where he was, looking back to see 
where the light went. When it point- 
ed elsewhere he ran again. The rain 
must have blurred the lights and the 
eyes behind him; the rain and the 
luck of Matt Keller. Lightning flick- 
ered about him, but whether it help- 
ed or hurt him he couldn’t begin 
to say. 

Even when he was sure he was 
free, he continued to run.

Millard Parlette pushed to 
chair back and viewed the type- 
writer with satisfaction. His spe^

to record the speech in to own 
voice, then play it over and over 
until he’d learned it by heart. 

But it had to go over. The crew 
had to be made to understand the 
issues. For too long they had lived 
the lives of a divinely ordained rul- 
ing class. If they couldn’t adapt — 

Even his own descendants . • 
they didn’t talk politics often; and 
when they did, Millard Parlette no- 
ticed that they talked in terms, not 
of Power, but of Rights. And the 
Parlettes were not typical. By now 
Millard Parlette could claim a verita- 
ble army of children, grandchildren, 
great-grandchildren, and so forth; yet 
he made every effort to see them 
all as often as possible. Those who 
had succumbed to the prevalent 
crewish tastes — to eldritch styles of 
dress, elegantly worded slander and 
all the other games the crew used 
to cloak their humdrum reality — 
had done so in spite of Millard Par- 
lette. The average crew was utterly 
dependant on the fact that he was a 
crew.

And if the power balance should 
shift? 

They’d be lost. For a time they’d 
be living in a false universe, under 
wrong assumptions; and in that time 
they would be destroyed. 

What chance . what chance 
that they would listen to an old man 
from a dead generation? 

No. He was just tired. Millard 
Parlette dropped the speech on his 
desk, stood up and left the study. At 
least he would force them to listen. 
By order of the Council, at two 
o’clock Sunday every pure-blooded 
crew on the planet would be in front 
of his teevee set. If he could put 
across ... he must. 

They had to understand the 
mixed blessing of Ramrobot #143. 

R ain filled the coral house with an 
incessant drumming. Only Im- 
plementation police moved within 
and without. The last unconscious 
colonist was on his way out the 
door on a stretcher as Major Jansen 
entered. 

He found Jesus Pietro lounging in 
an easy chair in thp living room. He 
put the handful of photos beside him. 
“What’s this supposed to be?” 
“These are the ones we haven’t 
caught yet, sir.” 

Jesus Pietro pulled himself erect, 
conscious once again of his soaked 
uniform. “How did they get past 
you?” 

“I can’t imagine, sir. Nobody es- 
caped after he was spotted.” 

“No secret tunnels. The echo 
sounders would have found them. 
Mpf.” Jesus Pietro shuffled rapidly 
through the photos. Most had names 



beneath the faces, names Jesus Pie- 
tro had remembered and jotted down 
earlier tonight “This is the core,” 
he said. “We’ll wipe out this branch 
of the Sons of Earth if we can find 
these. Where are they?” 

The aide was silent. He knew the 
question was rhetorical. The Head 
was leaning back with his eyes on 
the ceiling. 

Where were they? 

There were no tunnels out. They 
had not left underground. 

They hadn’t run away. They would 
have been stopped, or if not stopped, 
seen. Unless there were traitors in 
Implementation. But there weren’t. 
Period. 

Could they have reached the void 
edge? No, that was better guarded 
than the rest of the grounds. Rebels 
had a deplorable tendency to go off 
the edge when cornered. 

An aircar? Colonists wouldn’t 
have an aircar, not legally, and none 
had been reported stolen recently. 
But Jesus Pietro had always been 
convinced that at least one crew was 
involved in the Sons of Earth. He 
had no proof, no suspect; but his 
studies of history showed that a 
revolution always moves down from 
the top of a society’s structure. 

A crew might have supplied them 
with an escape car. TTiey’d have 
been seen but not stopped. No Im- 
plementation officer would halt a 
car ... “Jansen, find out if any 
cars were sighted during the raid. If 
there were, let me know when, how 
many, and descriptions.” 

Major Jansen left without showing 
his surprise at the peculiar order he’d 
just received.

IF 




An officer had found the house- 
cleaner nest, a niche in the south 
wall, near the floor. The man reach- 
ed in and carefully removed two un- 
conscious adult housecleaners and 
four pups, put them on the floor, 
reached in to remove the nest and 
the food dish. The niche would have 
to be searched. 

Jesus Pietro’s clothes dried slowly, 
in wrinkles. He sat with his eyes 
closed and his hands folded on his 
belly. Presently he opened his eyes, 
sighed and frowned slightly. 

Jesus Pietro, this is a very strange 
house. 

Yes. Almost garishly colonist. 
(Overtones of disgust.) 

Jesus Pietro looked at the pink 
coral walls, the flat-sanded floor 
which curved up at the edge of the 
rug to join the walls. Not a bad 
effect, if a woman were living here. 
But Harry Kane was a bachelor. 

How much would you say a 
house like this cost?” 

Oh, about a thousand stars, not 
including furnishings. Furnishings 
would cost twice that. Rugs, ninety 
stars if you bought one and let it 
spread. Two housecleaners, mated, 
fifty stars. 

And how much to put a basement 
under such a house? 

Mist Demons, what an idea! 
Basements have to be dug by hand, 
by human beings! It’d cost twenty 
thousand stars easily. You could 
build a school for that. Who would 
ever think of digging a basement un- 
der an architectural coral house? 

Who indeed? 

Jesus Pietro stepped briskly to the 
door. “Major Jansen!” 



T he sequel was likely to be messy. 

Jesus Pietro retired to the flying 
office while a team went in with an 
echo sounder. Yes, there was a large 
open space under the house. Major 
Chin wanted to find the entrance, 
but that might take all night,' and 
the sounds might warn the colonists. 
Jesus Pietro sat firmly on his curiosi- 
ty and ordered explosives. 

It was messy. The rebels had put 
together ^me ingenious devices from 
materials anyone would have con- 
sidered harmless. Two men died be^ 
fore sleepy gas grenades could be 
used. 

When all was quiet, Jesus Pietro 
followed the demolition teams into 
the basement. 

They found one of the unconscious 
rebels leaning on a deadman switch. 
They traced the leads to a home- 
made bomb big enough to blow 
house and basement to bits. While 
they disconnected the bomb, Jesus 
Pietro studied the man, making a 
mental note to ask him if he’d chick- 
ened out. He’d found that they often 
did. 

Behind one wall was a car, a 
three-year-old four-seater model with 
a bad scrape on the ground-effect 
skirt. Jesus Pietro could see no way 
to get it out of the basement, and 
neither could anyone else. The house 
must have been formed over it. Of 
course, thought Jesus Pietro; they dug 
the basement, then grew the house 
over it. He had his men cut away 
the wall so that the car could be re- 
moved later, if it was thought worth- 
while. They’d practically have to re- 
move the house. 

There was a flight of steps with a 



SLOWBOAT CARGO 



33 




trapdoor at the top. Jesus Pietro, 
examining the small bomb under 
the trapdoor, congratulated himself 
(pointedly, in Major Chin’s hearing) 
on not allowing Major Chin to search 
for the entrance. He might have found 
it Someone removed the bomb and 
opened the trapdoor. Above was the 
living room. An asymmetrical section 
of mutated grass rug had reluctantly 
tom away and come up with the 
door. When the door was lowered it 
would grow back within twenty min- 
utes. 

After the dead and unconscious 
had been filed away in patrol wagons, 
Jesus Pietro walked among them, 
comparing the faces with his final 
stack of photos. He was elated. With 
the exception of one man, he had 
collected Harry Kane and his en- 
tire guest list. The organ banks 
would be supplied for years. Not 
only would the crew have a full 
supply, which they always did any- 
way, but there would be spare parts 
for exceptional servants of the regime, 
Ue,, for civil sgprants such as Jesus 
Pietro and his ’'men. Even the col- 
onists would benefit. It was not at 
all unusual for the Hospital to treat 
a sick but deserving colonist, if the 
medical supplies could stand it. The 
Hospital treated everyone they 
could. It reminded the colonists that 
the crew ruled in their name, and 
had their interests at heart. 

And the Sons of Earth was dead. 
AlP-but one man, and from his pic- 
ture he wasn’t old enough to be 
dangerous. 

Nonetheless Jesus Pietro had his 
picture tacked to the Hospital bul- 
letin boards and sent a copy to the 



newscast station with the warning 
that he was wanted for questioning. 

It was not until dawn, when he 
was settling down to deep, that he 
remembered who belong^ to that 
face. Matthew Keller’s nephew, six 
years older than when he’d pulled 
that cider trick. 

He looked just like his uncle. 

T he rain stopped shortly before 
dawn, but Matt didn’t know it. 
Sheltered from the rain by a cliff 
and by a thick clump of watershed 
trees, he slept on. 

The cliff was the Beta-Gamma 
cliff. He’d fetched up against it some- 
time last night, dizzy and bruised and 
wet and winded. He could have col- 
lapsed there or tried running parallel 
to the cliff. He chose to collapse. If 
Implementation had found him he’d 
never have wakened, and he knew it 
as he went to sleep. He had been too 
exhausted to care. 

He woke about ten with a fero- 
cious headache. Every separate 
muscle hurt from running and from 
sleeping on bare ground. His tongue 
felt like the entire Implementation 
police force had marched over it in 
sweat socks. He stayed on his back, 
looking up into the dark trees his 
ancestors had called pines and tried 
to remember. 

So much to begin and end in one 
night. 

The people seemed to crowd 
around him. Hood, Laney, the four 
tall men, the kid who drank behind 
the bar, the laughing man who stole 
crew cars, Polly, Harry Kane and a 
forest of anonymous elbows and 
shouting voices. 



34 



IF 




All gone. The man whose scar he 
wore. The woman who’d left him 
flat. The genial mastermind-barten- 
der. And Laney! How could he have 
lost Laney? . They were gone. 
Over the next few years they might 
reappear in the form of eyes, lengths 
of artery and vein, grafts of hair- 
bearing scalp .... 

By now the police would be look- 
ing for Matt himself. 

He sat up, and every muscle 
screamed. He was naked. Implemen- 
tation must have found his clothes 
in Laney’s room. Could they match 
the clothes to him? And if they 
couldn’t, they’d still wonder how a 
man came to be wandering stark 
naked in open countryside. On the 
pedwalks of Earth there were licensed 
nudists, and on Wunderland you 
didn’t need a license; but on the 
Plateau there was no substitute for 
clothing. 

He couldn’t turn himself in. By 
now he’d never prove he wasn’t a 
rebel. He’d have to get clothes some- 
how and hope they weren’t looking 
for him already. 

He surged to his feet, and it hit 
him again. Laney, Laney in the dark, 
Laney looking at him in the lamp- 
lit bed. Polly, the girl with the secret. 
Hood, first name Jayhawk. A wave of 
sickness caught him, and he doubled 
over, retching. He stopped the 
spasms by sheer will power. His skuU 
was a throbbing drum. He straight- 
ened and walked to the edge of the 
watershed forest. 

To right and left the watershed 
trees stretched along the base of the 
Beta-Gamma cliff. Beta Plateau 
above him, unreachable except by 



the bridge, which must be miles to 
the left Before him, a wide meadow 
with a few grazing goats. Beyond 
houses. Houses in allr directions, 
thickly clustered. His own was per- 
haps four miles away. He’d never 
reach it without being stopped. 

How about Harry’s house? Laney 
had said there was a hiding place. 
And the ones who left before the 
raid . some of them might have 
returned. They could help him. 

But would they? 

He’d have to try it He might 
reach Harry’s house, crawling through 
the grass. The luck of Matt Keller 
might hold that far. He’d never reach 
his own. 

H is luck held: the strange luck 
that seemed to hide Matt KeUer 
when he didn’t want to be noticed. 
He reached the house two hours 
later. His knees and belly were green 
and itchy from the grass. 

The grounds about the house were 
solidly spread with wheel tracks. All 
of Implementation must have been 
in on the raid. Matt saw no guards, 
but he went carefully in case they 
were inside. Implementation guards 
or rebel guards, he could still be shot. 
Though a guard might hesitate to 
shoot him; he’d want to ask questions 
first. Like: “Where’s your pants, bud- 
dy?” 

Nobody was inside. A dead or 
sleeping family of housecleaners lay 
against one w^, beneath their looted 
nest. Dead, probably, or drugged. 
Housecleaners hated tight; they did 
their work at night. The rug showed 
a gaping hole that reached down 
through indoor grass and architectural 



SLOWBOAT CARGO 



35 




coral to a well furnished hole in the 
ground. The living room walls were 
spotted widi explosion marks and 
mercy-bullet streaks. So was the base- 
ment, when Matt climbed down to 
look. 

The basement was empty of men 
and nearly empty of equipment. 
Scars showed where heavy machinery 
had stood, more scars where it had 
been tom loose or burned loose. There 
were doors, foxir of them, all crude 
looking and all burned open. One led 
to a kitchen; two opened on empty 
storerooms. One whole wall lay on 
its side, but the piece of equipment 
beyond was intact. The hole left by 
the fallen wall might have been big 
enough to remove it; but certainly 
the hole in die living room floor was 
not. 

It was a car, a flying car of the 
type used by all crew families. Matt 
had never before seen one close up. 
There it was beyond the broken wall, 
with no possible way to get it out. 
What in blazes had Harry Kane 
wanted with a car that coiridn’t be 
flown? 

Perhaps this was what had brought 
on the raid. Cars were strictly denied 
to colonists. The military uses of a 
flying car are obvious. But why 
wasn’t its theft noticed earlier? The^ 
car must have been here when the’ 
house was built. 

Dimly Matt remembered a story 
he’d heard last night. Something 
about a stolen car set to circle the 
Plateau until the fuel ran out. No 
doubt the car had fallen in the mist, 
watched by furious, impotent crew. 
But — suppose he’d heard only the 
official version? Suppose the fuel had 



not run out; suppose the car had 
dipped into the mist, circled below 
the Plateau, and come up where 
Harry Kane could bury it m a hidden 
basement? 

Probably he’d never know. 

T he showers were still running. 
Matt was shivering badly when 
he stepped in. The hot water thawed 
him instantly. He let the water pour 
heavily down on the back of his 
neck, washing the grass stains and 
dirt and old sweat from him as it ran 
in streams to his feet. Life was bear- 
able. With all its horrors and all its 
failures, life was bearable where there 
were hot showers. 

He thought of something then, and 
metaphorically his ears pricked up. 

The raid had been so big. Imple- 
mentation had grabbed everyone at 
the party. From the number of 
tracks. It was likely they had taken 
even those who had left early, put- 
ting them to sleep one by one and 
two by two as they turned toward 
home. They must have returned to 
the Hospital with close to two hun- 
dred prisoners. 

Some were innocent. Matt knew 
that. And Implementation was usually 
fair about convictions. Trials were 
always closed, and only the results 
were ever published, but Implemen- 
tation usually preferred not to con- 
vict the innocent. Suspects had re- 
turned from the Hospital. 

But that wouldn’t take long. The 
police could simply release everyone 
without a hearing aid, with notations 
to keep an eye on them in future. 
He who wore a hearing aid was guil- 
ty. 



36 



IF 




But it would take time to reduce 
around a hundred convicted rebels 
to their component parts. 

The odds were that Laney, Hood, 
and Polly were still alive. Certainly 
they could not all be dead by this 
time. 

Matt stepped out of the shower 
and began looking for clothes. He 
found a closet which must have be- 
longed to Harry Kane, for the shorts 
were too wide and the shirts were 
too short. He dreSsed anyway, pull- 
ing shirt and shorts into a million 
wrinkles with the belt. At a dis- 
tance he’d pass. 

The clothes problem was as noth- 
ing, now. The problem he faced was 
much worse. 

He had no idea how long it took 
to take a man apart and store him 
away; though he could guess that it 
would take a long time to do it right. 
He didn’t know whether Implemen- 
tation, in the person of the dread 
Castro, would want to question the 
rebels first. But he did know that 
every minute he waited reduced the 
odds that each of the partygoers was 
still alive. Right now the odds were 
good. 

Matt Keller would go through life 
knowing that he had passed up his 
chance to save them. 

But, he reminded himself, it wasn’t 
really a chance. He had no way to 
reach Alpha Plateau without being 
shot. He’d have to cross two guarded 
bridges. 

The noonday sun shown through 
clean air on a clean, ordered world 
... in contrast to ^e gutted coral 
shell behind him. Matt hesitated on 
the doorstep, then resolutely turned 



back te the jagged hole in Harry 
Kane’s living room. Ht must know 
that it was hqppssible. The basement 
was the heart of the rebel strong- 
hold — a heart which had failed. If 
Implementation had overlooked a sin- 
gle weapon — 

T here were no weapons in the car, 
but he found an interesting as- 
sortment of scars. Ripped upholstery 
showed bolts attached to the exposed 
metal walls; but the bolts had been 
cut or tom out. Matt found six 
places which must have been gun 
mounts. A bin in back might have 
held makeshift hand grenades. Or 
sandwiches; Matt couldn’t tell. Imple- 
mentation had taken anything that 
might have been a weapon, but they 
didn’t seem to have harmed the car. 
Presumably they would come back 
and dig it out some day, if they 
thought it worth the effort. 

He got in and looked at the dash- 
board, but it didn’t tell him any- 
thing. He’d never seen a car dash- 
board. There had been a cover over 
it, padlocked, but the padlock lay 
broken on the floor and the cover 
was loose. Harry’s padlock? Or the 
original owners? 

He sat in the unfamiliar vehicle, 
unwilling to leave because leaving 
would mean giving up. When he no- 
ticed a button labeled “Start”, he 
pished it. He never heard the purr 
of the motor starting. 

The blast made him spasm like a 
galvanized frog. It came all in one 
burst, like the sound of a gunshot as 
heard by a fly sitting in the barrel. 
Harry must have set something to 
blow up the house! But no, he was 

U! 



38 




still alive. And there was daylight 
pouring in on him. 

Daylight 

Four feet of earth had disappeared 
from above him. A wall of the house 
was in his field of vision. It leaned. 
Harry Kane must have been a genius 
with shaped-charge explosives. Or 
known one. Come to that Matt 
could have done the job for him. 
The mining worms didn’t do all his 
work. 

Daylight. And the motor was run- 
ning. He could hear an almost 
soundless hum, now that his ears 
had recovered from the blast. If he 
flew the car straight up ... 

He’d have had to cross two 
guarded bridges to reach Alpha Pla- 
teau. Now he could fly there, if he 
could learn to fly before the car kill- 
ed him. 

Or, he could go home. He 
wouldn’t be noticed, despite his ill- 
fitting clothes. Colonists tended to 
mind their own business, leaving it 
to the crew and Implementation to 
maintain order. He’d change clothes, 
bum these, and who would know or 
ask where he’d been over the week- 
end? 

Matt sighed and examined the 
dashboard again. He couldn’t quit 
now. Later, maybe, when he crashed 
the car, or when they stopped him 
in the air. Not now. The blast that 
had freed his path was an omen, 
one he couldn’t ignore. 

Let’s see. Four levers set at zero. 
“Fans. 1-2, 1-3, 2-4, 3-4.” Why 
would those little levers be set to 
control the fans in pairs? He pulled 
one toward him. Nothing. 

A small bar with three notches. 



“Neutral. Ground. Air.” Set on Neu- 
tral. He moved it to Ground. Nothing. 
If he’d had the “Ground altitude” 
set for the number of inches he 
wanted, the fans woiild have started. 
But he didn’t know that. He tried Air. 

The car tried to flop over on its 
back. 

H e was in the air before he had it 
quite figured out. In despera- 
tion he pulled all the Fan throttles 
full out and tried to keep the car 
from rolling over by pushing each 
one in a little at a time. The ground 
dwindled until the sheep of Beta 
Plateau were white flecks and the 
houses of Gamma were tiny squares. 
Finally the car jbegan to settle down. 

Not that he could relax for a mo- 
ment. 

Fans number 1, 2, 3, 4 were left 
front, right front, left rear, right 
rear. Dropping lever 1-2 dropped the 
front of the car; 3-4, the back; 1-3, 
the left side; 2-4, the right side. He 
had the car upright, and he began 
to think he had the knack of it. 

But how to go forward? 

There were Attitude and Rotation 
dials, but they didn’t do anything. He 
didn’t dare touch the switch with 
the complicated three-syllable word 
on it. But . suppose he tilted the 
car forward? Depress the 1-2 throttle. 

He did, just a little. The car ro- 
tated slowly forward. Then faster! 
He pulled the lever out hard. The 
rotation slowed and stopped when 
the Plateau stood before his face like 
a vertical wall. Before the wall could 
strike him in the face he got the car 
righted, waited until his nerves 
stopped jumping, then tried it again. 



SLOWBOAT CARGO 



39 




This time he pushed the 1-2 lever 
in a little, waited three seconds, pull- 
ed it out hard. It worked, after a 
fashion. The car began to move for- 
ward with its nose dipped. 

Luckily he was facing Alpha 
Plateau. Otherwise he would have had 
to fly backward, and that would 
have made him conspicuous. He 
didn’t know how to turn around. 

He was going pretty fast. He 
went even faster when he found a 
knob labeled “Slats”. The car also 
started to drop. Matt remembered 
the Venetian-blind arrangements un- 
der the four fans. He left the slats 
where they were, leveled the car’s at- 
titude. It must have been right, be- 
cause the car kept moving forward. 

It was hardly wobbling at all. 

And Matt was faced with the most 
spectacular view he had ever known. 

The fields and woods-orchards of 
Beta rolled beneath. Alpha Plateau 
was quite visible at this height. The 
Alpha-Beta cliff was a crooked line 
with a wide river following the bot- 
tom. The Long Fall. The river show- 
ed flashes of blue within the steep 
channel it had carved for itself. Cliff 
and river terminated at the void edge 
to the left; and the murmur of the 
river’s fall came through the cock- 
pit plastic. To the right was a land 
of endless jagged, tilted plains, soft- 
ening and blurring in the blue dis- 
tance. 

Soon he would cross the cliff and 
turn toward the Hospital. Matt didn’t 
know just what it looked like, but 
he was sure he’d recognize the huge 
hollow cylinders of the spacecraft. A 
few cars hovered over Beta, none 
very close, and a great many more 

40 



showed like black midges over Al- 
pha. They wouldn’t bother him. He 
hadn’t decided how close he would 
get to the Hospital before landing; 
evem crew mi^t not be permitted 
within a certain distance. Other than 
that he should be fairly safe from 
recognition. A car was a car, and only 
crew flew cars. Anyone who saw him 
would assume he was a crew. 

It was a natural mistake. Matt 
never did realize just where he went 
wrong. He had fine judgment and 
good balance, and he was flying the 
car as well as was humanly possible. 
If someone had told him a ten-year- 
old crew child could do it better, he 
would have been hurt. 

But a ten-year-old crew child 
would never have lifted a car with- 
out flipping the “Gyroscope” switch. 

vn 

A s usual, but much later than usu- 
al, Jesus Pietro had breakfast 
in bed. As usual. Major Jansen sat 
nearby, drinking coffee, ready to run 
errands and answer questions. 

“Did you get the prisoners put 
away all right?” 

“Yes, sir, in the Vivarium. All but 
three. We didn’t have room for them 
aU.” 

“And they’re in the organ banks?” 
“Yes, sir.” 

Jesus Pietro swallowed a grape- 
fruit slice. “Let’s hope they didn’t 
know anything important. What about 
the deadheads?” 

“We separated out the ones with- 
out ear mikes and turned them loose. 
Fortunately we finished before six 
o’clock, when the mikes evaporated.” 

IF 




“Evaporated, forsoothl Nothing 
left?” 

“Doctor Gospin took samples of 
the air. He may find residues.” 

“It’s not important. A nice trick, 
though, considering their resources,” 
said Jesus Pietro. 

After five minutes of uninterrupted 
munching and sipping sounds, he 
abruptly wanted to know: “What 
about Keller?” 

“Who, sir?” 

“The one that got away.” 

And after three phone calls Major 
Jansen was able to say, “No reports 
from the colonist areas. Nobody’s 
volunteered to turn him in. He 
hasn’t tried to go home, or to contact 
any relative or anyone he knows pro- 
fessionally. None of the police in on 
the raid recognize his face. None will 
admit that someone got past him.” 
More silence, while Jesus Pietro 
finished his coffee. Then: “See to it 
that the prisoners are brought to my 
office one at a time. I want to know 
if anyone saw the landing yesterday.” 
“One of the girls was carrying 
photos, sir. Of package number three. 
They must have been taken with a 
scopic lens.” 

“Oh?” For a moment Jesus Pietro’s 
thoughts showed clear behind a glass 
skull. Millard Parlette! If he found 
out — “I don’t know why you 
couldn’t tell me that before. Treat 
it as confidential. Now get on with 
it. No, wait a minute,” he called as 
Jansen turned to the door. “One 
more thing. There may be basements 
that we don’t know about. Detail a 
couple of echo-sounder teams for a 
house-to-house search on Delta and 
Eta Plateaus.” 



“Yes sir. And is this priority?” 
“No, no, no. The vivarium’s two 
deep already. Tell them to take their 
time.” 

The phone stopped Major Jansen 
from leaving. He picked it up, list- 
ened, then' demanded, “Well, why 
call here? Hold on.” With a touch 
of derision he reported, “A car ap- 
proaching, sir, being flown in a 
reckless manner. Naturally they had 
to call you personally.” 

“Now why the — Mph. Could it 
be the same make as the car in Kane’s 
basement?” 

“I’ll ask.” He did. “It is, sir.” 

“I should have known there’d be 
a way to get it out of the basement. 
Tell them to bring it down.” 

G eologists {don*t let’s have a hard 
time about that word) be- 
lieved that Mount Lookitthat was 
geologically recent. A few hundreds 
of thousands of years ago, part of 
the planet’s skin had turned molten. 
Possibly a convection current in the 
interior had carried more than or- 
dinarily hot magma up to melt the 
surface; possibly an asteroid had died 
a violent, fiery death. A slow extru- 
sion had followed, with viscous 
magma rising and cooling and rising 
and cooling until a plateau with 
fluted sides and an approximately 
flat top stood forty miles above the 
surface. 

It had to be recent. Such a pre- 
posterous anomaly could not long 
resist the erosion of Mount Lookit- 
that’s atmosphere. 

And because it was recent, the 
surface was jagged. Generally the 
northern end was higher, high 



SLOWaOAT CARGO 



41 




enough to hold a permanent sliding 
glacier, and too high and too cold for 
comfort Generally rivers and streams 
ran south, to join either the Muddy 
or the Long Fall, both of which had 
carved deep canyons for themselves 
through the southland. Both canyons 
ended in spectacular waterfalls, the 
tallest in the known universe. Gen- 
erally the rivers ran south; but there 
were exceptions, for the surface of 
Mount Lookitthat was striated, dif- 
ferentiated, a maze of plateaus divid- 
ed by cliffs and chasms. 

Some plateaus were flat; some of 
the cliffs were straight and vertical. 
Most of these were in the south. In 
the north the surface was all tilted 
blocks and strange lakes with deep 
pointed bottoms, and the land would 
have been cruel to a mountain goat. 
Nonetheless these regions would be 
settled someday, just as the Rocky 
Mountains of Earth were now part 
of suburbia. 

The slowboats had landed in the 
south, on the highest plateau around. 
The colonists had been forced to 
sjetde lower down. Though they were 
the more numerous, they covered 
less territory, for the crew had cars, 
and flying cars can make a distant 
mountain home satisfactory where bi- 
cycles will not. Yet Alpha Plateau 
was Crew Plateau, and for many it 
was better to live elbow to elbow 
with one’s peers than out in the 
boondocks in splendid isolation. 

So Alpha Plateau was crowded. 

What Matt saw below him was 
all houses. They varied enormously in 
size, in color, in style, in building 
material. To Matt, who had lived out 
his life in architectural coral, the 



dwellings looked like sheer havoc, 
like debris from the explosion of a 
time machine. There was even 
a clump of deserted, crumbling coral 
bungalows, each far bigger than a 
colonist’s home. Two or three were 
as large as Matt’s old grade school. 
When architectural coral first came 
to the Plateau the crew had reserved 
it for their own use. Later it had gone 
permanently out of style. 

None of the nearby buildings seem- 
ed to be more than two stories taU. 
Someday there would be skyscrapers, 
if the crew kept breeding .... But 
in the distance two squat towers rose 
from a shapeless construction in 
stone and metal. The Hospital, with- 
out a doubt. And straight ahead. 

M att was beginning to feel the 
strain of flying. He had to 
divide his attention between the dash- 
board, the ground and the Hospital 
ahead. It was coming closer; and he 
was beginning to appreciate its size. 

Each of the empty slowboats had 
been built to house six crew in ade- 
quate comfort and fifty colonists in 
stasis. Each slowboat also included a 
cargo hold, two water-fueled reaction 
motors and a water fuel tank. And 
all of this had to be fitted into a hol- 
low double-walled cylinder the shape 
of a beer can from which the top 
and bottom have been removed with 
a can opener. The slowboats had been 
circidar flying wings. In transit be- 
tween worlds they had spun on their 
axes to provide centrifugal gravity, 
and the empty space inside the inner 
hull, now occupied only by two inter- 
secting tailfins, had once held two 
throwaway hydrogen balloons. 



42 



IF 




They were big. Since Matt could 
not see the inner emptiness which 
the crew called the Attic, they looked 
far bigger. Yet they were swamped 
by the haphazard-looking stone con- 
struction of the Hospital. Most of it 
was two stories high, but there were 
towers which climbed halfway up the 
ships* hulls. Some would be power 
stations, others — he couldn’t guess. 
Flat barren rock surrounded the Hos- 
pital in a half-mile circle, rock as 
naked as the Plateau had been be- 
fore the slowboats brought a careful- 
ly selected ecology. From the edge 
of the perimeter a thin tongue of for- 
est reached across the rock to touch 
the Hospital. 

All else had been cleared away. 
Why, Matt wondered, had Implemen- 
tation left that one stretch of trees? 

A wave of numbness hit him and 
passed, followed by a surge of panic. 
A sonic stun beam! For the first time 
he looked behind him. Twenty to 
thirty Implementation police cars 
were scattered in his wake. 

It hit him again, glancingly. Matt 
shoved the 1-3 throttle all the way in. 
The car dipped left, tilted forty-five 
degrees or more before he moved 
to steady it. He shot away to the 
left, gathering speed toward the" void 
edge of Alpha Plateau. 

The numbness reached him and 
locked its teeth. They had been trying 
to force him to land; now they want- 
ed him to crash before he could 
go over the edge. His sight blurred; 
he couldn’t move. The car dropped, 
sliding across space toward the 
ground and toward the void. 

The numbness ebbed. He tried to 
move his hands and got nothing but 



a twitch. Then the sonic found him 
again, but with lessened intensity. He 
thou^ he knew why. He was out- 
radng the police because they did 
not care to sacrifice altitude for 
speed, to risk striking the lip of the 
void edge. That was a game for the 
desperate. 

Through blurred eyes he saw the 
dark cliff-edge come up at him. He 
missed it by yards. He could move 
again, jerkily, and he turned his head 
to see the cars dropping after him. 
They must know they’d lost him, but 
they wanted to see him fall. 

How far down was the mist? He’d 
never known. MUes, certainly. Tens 
of miles? They’d hover above him 
until he disappeared behind the mist. 
He couldn’t go back to the Plateau; 
they’d stun him, wait, and scrape up 
what was left after the crash. There 
was only one direction he could go 
now. 

Matt flipped the car over on its 
back. 

T he police followed him down un- 
til their ears began to pop. Then 
they hovered, waiting. It was minutes 
before the fugitive car faded from 
sight, upside down all the way, a re- 
ceding blurred dark mote trailing a 
hairline of shadow through the mist, 
flickering at the edge of human 
vision. Gone. 

“Hell of a way to go,” someone 
said. It went over the intercom, and 
there were grunts of agreement. 

The police turned for home, which 
was now far above them. They knew 
perfectly well that their cars were not 
airtight. Almost, but not quite. Even 
in recent years men had taken their 



SLOWBOAT CARGO 



43 




cars below the Plateau, to prove their 
courage and to gauge what level they 
could reach before the air turned 
poisonous. That level was far above 
the mist. Someone named Greeley 
had even tried the daredevil stunt of 
dropping his car with the fans set to 
idle, falling as far as he could before 
the poison mist could leak into his 
cabin. He had dropped four miles, 
with the hot, noxious gasses whistling 
around the door, before he had to 
stop. He was lucky enough to get 
back up before he passed out. The 
Hospital had had to replace his 
lungs. On Alpha Plateau he was still 
a kind of hero. 

Even Greeley would never have 
flipped his car over and bored for 
the bottom. Nobody would, not if he 
knew anything about cars. It might 
come apart in the air! 

But that wouldn’t occur to Matt. 
He knew little about machinery. 
Earth’s strange pets were necessities, 
but machinery was a luxury. Colonists 
needed cheap houses and hardy fruit 
trees and rugs which did not have to 
be made by hand. They did not 
need powered dishwashers, refrigera- 
tors, razors or cars. Complex ma- 
chinery had to be made by other ma- 
chines, and the crew was wary of 
passing machines to colonists. Such 
machinery as there was was publicly 
owned. The most complex vehicle 
Matt knew was a bicycle. A car 
wasn’t meant to fly without gyros- 
copes, but Matt had done it. 

He had to get down to the mist 
to hide himself from the police. The 
faster he fell, the further he’d leave 
them behind. 

At first the seat pressed against 



him with the full force of the fans; 
about one and a half Mount Lookit- 
that gravitities. The wind rose to a 
scream, even through the soundproof- 
ing. Air held him back, harder and 
harder, until it compensated for the 
work of the fans; and then he was 
in free fall. And still he fell faster! 
Now the air began to cancel gravity, 
and Matt tried to fall to the roof. 
He had suspected that he was making 
the car do something unusual, but 
he didn’t know how unusual. When 
the wind resistance started to pull 
him out of his seat he snatched at 
the arms and looked frantically for 
something to hold him down. He 
found the seat belts. Not only did 
they hold him down, once he man- 
aged to get them fastened. They re- 
assured him. Obviously they were 
meant for just this purpose. 

It was getting dark. Even the sky 
beneath his feet was darkening; and 
the police cars were not to be seen. 
Very well. Matt pushed the fan 
throttles down to the Idle notches. 

T he blood rushing to his head 
threatened to choke him. He 
turned the car rightside up. Pressure 
jammed him deep in his seat with a 
force no man had felt since the brute- 
force chemical rockets; but he could 
stand it now. What he couldn’t en- 
dure was the heat. And the pain in 
his ears. And the taste of the air. 

He pulled the throttles out again. 
He wanted to stop fast. 

Come to that, would he know 
when he stopped? This around him 
was not a wispy kind of mist, but a 
dark blur giving no indication of his 
velocity. From above the mist was 



44 



IF 




white; from below> black. Being lost 
down here would be horrible. At least 
he knew which way was up. It was 
fractionally lighter in that direction. 

The air tasted like flaming 
molasses. 

He had the throttles all the way 
out. Still the gas crept in. Matt pulled 
his shirt over his mouth and tried to 
breathe through that. No good. Some- 
thing like a black wall emerged from 
the mist-blur, and he tilted the car in 
time to avoid crashing against the 
side of Mount Lookitthat. He stayed 
near the black wall, watching it rush 
past him. He’d be harder to see in 
the shadow of the void edge. 

The mist disappeared. He shot up- 
ward through sparkling sunlight. 
When he thought he was good and 
clear of the foul mist, and when he 
couldn’t stand to breathe hot poison 
for another second, he put the win- 
dow down. The car whipped to the 
side and tried to turn over. A hurri- 
cane roared through the cabin. It was 
hot and thick and soupy, that hurri- 
cane, but it could be breathed. 

He saw the edge of the Plateau 
above him, and he pushed the throttles 
in a little to slow down. His stomach 
turned a filp-flop. For the first time 
since he’d gotten into the car, he had 
time to be sick. His stomach tried to 
turn over, his head was splitting from 
the sudden changes in pressure, and 
the Implementation sonics were hav- 
ing their revenge in twitching, jerk- 
ing muscles. He kept the car more 
or less upright until the edge of the 
Plateau came level with him. There 
was a stone wall along the edge here. 
He eased the car sideways, eased it 
back when he was over the wall. 



tilted it by guess and hope imtil he 
was motionless in the air, then let it 
drop. 

The car fell about four feet. Matt 
opened the door but stopped him- 
self from getting out. What he really 
wanted to do was faint; but he’d left 
the fans idling. He found the “Neu- 
tral .. Ground . Air” toggle and 
shoved it forward without much care. 
He was tired and sick and he wanted 
to lie down. i 

The toggle fell in the “Ground” 
slot. 

Mat stumbled out the door . 
stumbled because the car was rising. 

It rose four inches off the ground 
and began to slide. During his experi- 
menting Matt must have set the 
ground altitude, so that the car was 
now a ground-effect vehicle. It slid 
away from him as he tried to reach 
for it. He watched on hands and 
knees as it glided away across the 
uneven ground, bounced against the 
wall and away, against the wall and 
away. It circled the end of the wall 
and went over the edge. 

Matt flopped on his back and 
closed his eyes. He didn’t care if he 
never saw a car again. 

The motion sickness, the sonic 
aftereffects, the poisoned air he’d 
breathed, the pressure changes . 
they gripped him hard, and he want- 
ed to die. Then, by stages, they be- 
gan to let go. Nobody found him 
there. A house was nearby, but it 
had a vacant look. After some time 
Matt sat up and took stock of him- 
self. 

His throat hurt. There was a 
strange, unpleasant taste in his mouth. 

He was still on Alpha Plateau. 



SLOWBOAT CARGO 



45 




Only crew would go to the trouble 
of building walls along a void edge. 
So he was committed. Without a car 
he could no more leave Alpha Plateau 
than he could have arrived here in 
the first place. 

But the house was architectural 
coral. Bigger than anything he was 
used to, it was still coral. Which 
meant that it should have been de- 
serted about forty years. 

He’d have to risk it. He needed 
cover. There were no trees nearby, 
and trees were dangerous to hide in; 
they would probably be fruit trees, 
and someone might come applepick- 
ing. Matt got up and moved toward 
the house. 

VIII 

T he Hospital was the control nexus 
of a world. It was not a large 
world, and the settled region totalled 
a mere 20,0 0 square miles; but that 
region needed a lot of control. It 
also required considerable electricity, 
enormous quantities of water to be 
moved up from the Long Fall River, 
and a deal of medical attention. The 
Hospital was big and complex and 
diversified. Two fifty-six-man space- 
craft were its east and west comers. 
Since the spacecraft were hollow 
cylinders with the airlocks opening 
to the inside (to the Attic, as that 
inner space had been called when 
the rotating ships were between stars 
and the ship’s axis was Up), the 
corridors in that region were twisted 
and mazelike and hard to navigate. 

So the young man in Jesus Pietro’s 
office had no idea where he was. 
Even if he’d managed to leave the 



office unguarded he’d have been 
hopelessly lost. And he knew it. That 
was all to the good. 

“You were on the dead-man 
switch,” said Jesus Pietro. 

The man nodded. His sandy hair 
was cut in the old Belter style, copied 
from the even older Mohawk. There 
were shadows under his eyes as if 
from lack of sleep, and the lie was 
borne out by a slump of utter de- 
pression; though he had been sleeping 
since his capture in Harry Kane’s 
basement. 

“You funked it,” Jesus Pietro ac- 
cused. “You arranged to fall across 
the switch so that it wouldn’t go 
off.” 

The man looked up. Naked rage 
was in his face. He made no move, 
for there was nothing he could do. 

“Don’t be ashamed. The dead man 
switch is an old trick. It almost never 
gets used in practice. The man in 
charge is too likely to change his 
mind at the last second. It’s a — ” 
“I fully expected to wake up 
dead!” the man shouted. 

“ — natural reaction. It takes a 
psychotic to commit suicide. No, 
don’t tell me all about it. I’m not 
interested. I want to hear about the 
car in your basement.” 

“You think I’m a coward, do 
you?” 

“That’s an ugly word.” 

“7 stole that car.” 

“Did you?” The skeptical tone was 
genuine. Jesus Pietro did not believe 
him. “Then perhaps you can tell me 
why the theft went unnoticed,” 

TTie man told him. He talked 
eargerly, demanding that Jesus Pie- 
tro recognize his courage. Why not? 



46 



IF 




There was nobody left to betray. He 
weuld live as long as Jesus Pietro 
Castro was interested in him, and 
far three minutes longer. The organ 
bank operating room was three min- 
utes’ walk away. Jesus Pietro listened 
politely. Yes, he remembered the car 
that had tauntingly circled the 
Plateau for five days. The young 
crew owner had given him hell for 
letting it happen. The man had even 
suggested — demanded — that one 
af Castro’s men drop on the car from 
above, climb into the cockpit and 
bring it back. Jesus Pietro’s patience 
had given out, and he had risked his 
life by politely offering to help the 
young man perform the feat. 

“So we buried it at the same time 
we built the basement,” the prisoner 
finished. “Then we let the house 
grow over it. We had great plans.” 
He sagged into his former position 
of despair, but went on talking, 
mumbling. “There were gun mounts. 
Bins for bombs. We stole a sonic 
stunner and mounted it in the rear 
window. Now nobody’ll ever use 
them.” 

“The car was used.” 

“What?” 

“This afternoon. Keller escaped us 
last night. He returned to Kane’s 
home this morning, took the car and 
flew it nearly to the Hospital before 
we stopped him. The Mist Demons 
know what he .thought he was doing.” 

“Great. ‘The last flight of — ’ We 
never got around to naming it. Our 
air force. Our glorious air force. Who 
did you say?” 

“Keller. Matthew Leigh Keller.” 

“I don’t know him. What would 
he be doing with my car?” 



“Don”t play games. You are not 
protecting anyone. We drove him off 
the edge. Five ten, age twenty-one, 
hair brown, eyes blue — ” 

“I tell you I never met him.” 
“Good-by.” Jesus Pietro pushed a 
button under his desk. The door 
opened. 

“Wait a minute. Now, wait — ” 
Lying, Jesus Pietro thought, after 
the man was gone. Probably lied 
about the car too. Somewhere in the 
vivarium the man who really took 
the car waited to be questioned. If it 
was stolen. It could equally well 
have been supplied by a crew mem- 
ber, by Jesus Pietro’s hypothetical 
traitor. 

He had often wondered why the 
crew would not supply him with 
truth drugs. They would have been 
easy to manufacture from instruc- 
tions in the ship’s libraries. Millard 
Parlette, in a mellow mood, had once 
tried to explain. “We own their 
bodies,” he had said. “We take them 
apart on the slightest pretext, and if 
they manage to die a natural death 
we get them anyway, what we can 
save. Aren’t the poor bastards at 
least entitled to the privacy of their 
own minds?” 

It seemed a peculiar bleeding- 
heart attitude, coming from a man 
whose very life depended on the or- 
gan banks. But others apparently felt 
the same. If Jesus Pietro wanted his 
questions answered, he must depend 
on his own empirical brand of psy- 
chology.

Height: five one. Weight:

party dress in the colonist style. In 
Jesus Pietro’s eyes it did notfahig for 
her. She was small and brown and, 
compared to most of the women 
Jesus Pietro met socially, muscular. 
They were work muscles, not tennis 
muscles. Traces of callous marred her 
hands. Her hair, worn straight back, 
had a slight natural curl to it but no 
trace of style. 

Had she been raised as crew girls 
were raised, had she access to cos- 
metics available on Alpha Plateau, 
die would have known how to be 
beautiful. Then she wouldn’t have 
been bad at aU, once the callous left 
her hands and cosmetic treatment 
smoothed her skin. But, like most 
colonists, she had aged faster than 
a crew. 

She was only a young colonist 
girl, like a thousand other young 
colonist girls Jesus Pietro had seen. 

She bore his silent stare for a 
full minute then snapped, “Well?” 

“Well? You’re Polly Toumquist, 
aren’t you?” 

“Of course.” 

“You had a handful of films on 
you when you were picked up last 
night. How did you get them?” 

“I prefer not to say.” 

“Eventually I think you will. 
Meanwhile, what would you like to 
talk about?” 

Polly looked bewildered. “Are you 
serious?” 

‘I am serious. I’ve interviewed six 
people today. The organ banks are 
full, and the day is ending. I’m in no 
hurry. Do you know what those films 
of yours imply?” 

She nodded warily. “I think so. 
Especially after the raid.” 

48 



“Oh, you saw the point, did you?” 
“It’s clear you have no more use 
for the Sons of Earth. We’ve always 
been some danger to you — ” 
“You flatter yourselves.” * 

“But you’ve never had a real try 
at wiping us out. Not till now. Be- 
cause we serve as a recruiting center 
for your 'damned organ banks!” 
“You amaze me. Did you know 
this when you joined?” 

“I was fairly sure of it.” 

“Then why join?” • 

She spread her hands. “Why does 
anybody join? I couldn’t stand the 
way things are now. Castro, what 
happens to your body when you 
die?” 

“Cremated. I’m an old man.” 
“You’re a crew. They’d cremate 
you anyway. Only colonists go into 
the banks.” 

“I’m half crew,” said Jesus Pie- 
tro. His desire to talk was genuine, 
and there was no need for reticence 
with a girl who was, to all intents and 
purposes, dead. “\^en my — you 
mi^t say — pseudo-father reached 
the age of seventy he was old enough 
to need injections of testosterone. Ex4 
cept that he chose a different way 
to get them.” 

The girl looked bewildered, then 
horrified. 

“I see you understand. Shortly 
afterward his wife, my mother, be- 
came pregnant. I must admit they 
raised me almost as a crew. I love 
them both. I don’t know who my 
father was. He may have been a 
rebel, or a thief.” 

“To you there’s no difference, I 
suppose.” The girl’s tone was savage. 
“No. Back to the Sons of Earth,”

Jesus Pietro held his face like frozen 
stone while the flood receded. It 
took several seconds. 

“What about Matthew Leigh Kel- 
ler?” 

“Who? I mean — ” 

“You prefer not to say. Miss 
Tournquist, you probably know that 
there are no truth drugs on this world. 
In the ships’ libraries are instruc- 
tions for making scopolamine, but no 
crew will authorize me to use them. 
Hence I have developed different 
methods.” He saw her stiffen. “No. 
no. There will be no pain. They’d 
put me in the organ banks if I used 
torture. I’m only going to give you a 
nice rest.” 

“I think I know what you mean. 
Castro, what are you made of? 
You’re half colonist yourself. What 
makes you side with the crew?” 

“There must be law and order. 
Miss Toumiquist. On all of Mount 
Lookitthat there is only one force for 
law and order, and that force is the 
crew.” Jesus Pietro pushed the call 
button. ' 

He did not relax until she was 
gone, and then he found himself 
shaken. Had she noticed that flash 
of desire? What an embarrassing 
thing to happen! But she must have 
assumed he was only angry. Of 
course she had. 

Polly was in the maze of corridors 
when she suddenly remembered Matt 
Keller. Her regal dignity, assumed 
for the benefit of the pair of Im- 
plementation police who were her es- 
corts, softened in thought. Why 
would Jesus Pietro be interested in 
Matt? He wasn’t even a member. Did 
it mean that he had escaped? 



Odd, about that night. She’d liked 
Matt. He’d interested her. And then, 
suddenly — It must have looked to 
him as if she’d bru^ed him off. 
Well, it didn’t matter now. But Im- 
plementation should have turned him 
loose. He was nothing but a dead- 
head. 

Castro./ Why had he told her all 
that? Was it part of the coffin cure? 
Well, she’d hold out as long as pos- 
sible. Let Castro worry about who 
might know the truth of ramrobot 
#143. She had told nobody. 

T he crew girl looked about her in 
pleased wonder, at the curving 
walls and ceiling with their peeled, 
discolored paint, at the spiral stairs, 
at the matted, withered brown rug 
which had been indoor grass. She 
watched the dust puff out from her 
falling feet, and she ran her hands 
over the coral walls where the paint 
had fallen away. Her new, brightly 
dyed falling jumper seemed to glow 
in the gloom of the deserted house. 

“It’s very odd,” she said. Her 
crewish accent was strange and lilting. 

The man lifted an arm from 
around her waist to wave it about 
him. “They live just like this,” he 
said in the same accent. “Just like 
this. You can see their houses from 
your car on the way to the lake.” 
Matt smiled as he watched them 
walk up the stairs. He had never 
seen a two-story coral house; the 
balloons were too hard to blow, and 
the second floor tended to sag un- 
less you maintained two distinct pres- 
sures. Why didn’t they come to Delta 
Plateau, if they wanted to see how 
colonists lived?

IF 




But why should they? Surely their 
own lives were more interesting. 

What strange people they were. 
It was hard to understand them» not 
only because of the lilt but because 
certain words meant the wrong 
things. Their faces were alien, with 
flared nostrils and high, prominent 
cheekbones. Against the people Matt 
had known, they seemed fragile, un- 
dermuscled, but graceful and beauti- 
ful to the point where Matt wonder- 
ed about the man’s manhood. They 
walked like they owned the world. 

Tho deserted house had proved a 
disappointment. He’d thought all was 
lost when the crew couple came 
strolling in, pointing and staring as 
if they were in a museum. But with 
luck they would be up there for 
some time. 

Matt moved very quietly from the 
darkness of a now doorless closet, 
picked up their picnic basket. 

There was a place where he could 
hide, a place he should have thought 
of before. 

He climbed over the low stone wall 
with the picnic basket in one hand. 
There was a three-foot granite lip 
on the void side. Matt settled him- 
self cross-legged against the stone 
wall, with his head an inch below 
the top and his toes a foot from the 
forty-mile drop to hell. He opened 
the picnic basket. 

There was more than enough for 
two. He ate it all, eggs and sand- 
wiches and squeezebags of custard 
and a thermos of soup and a hand- 
ful of olives. Afterward he kicked 
the basket and the scraps of plastic 
wrap into the void. His eyes followed 
them down. Consider the following: 



Anyone can see infinity by looking 
up on a clear night. But only on 
the small world of Mount Looldtthat 
can »you see infinity by looking 
down. 

No, it’s not really infinity. Neither 
is the night sky, really. You can see 
a few nearby galaxies; but even if 
the universe turns out to be finite, 
you see a very little distance into it. 
Matt could see apparent infinity by 
looking straight down. 

He could see the picnic basket fall^ 
ing. Smaller. Gone. 

The plastic wrap. Fluttering down. 
Gone. 

Then, nothing but the white mist. 

IX 

O n a far distant day they would 
call the phenomenon ‘Tlateau 
trance.” It was a form of auto- 
hypnosis well known to Plateau citi- 
zens of both social classes, differing 
from other forms only in diat nearly 
anyone could fall into such a state by 
accident. In this respect Plateau 
trance compares to ancient, badly 
authenticated cases of “highway hyp- 
nosis,” or to more recent stupes of 
“the far look,” a form of religious 
trance endemic to the Belt of Sol. 
“The far look” comes to a miner who 
spends too many minutes staring at 
a single star in the background of 
naked space. “Plateau trance” starts 
with a long, dreamy look down into 
the void mist. 

For a good eight hours Matt had 
not had a chance to relax. He 
would not get a chance tonight, and 
he didn’t want to dwell on that now. 
Here was his chance. He relaxed.

He came out of it with a niggling 
suspicion that time had passed. He 
was lying on his side, his face over 
the edge, staring down into un- 
fathomable darkness. It was night. 
And he felt wonderful. 

Until he remembered. ^ 

He got up and climbed carefully 
over the wall. It would not do to 
slip, three feet from the edge, and 
he was often clumsy when he felt 
this nervous. Now his stomach seem- 
ed to have been replaced by a plas- 
tic demonstration model from a 
biology class. There was a jerkiness 
in his limbs. 

He walked a litde way from the 
wall and stopped. Which way was 
the Hospital? 

Come now, he thought. This is 
ridiculous. 

Well, there was a swelling hill to 
his left. Light glowed faintly along 
its rim. He’d try that. 

The grass and the earth beneath 
it ended as he reached the top. Now 
there was stone beneath his bare feet, 
stone and rock dust untouched by 
three hundred years of the colony 
planting program. He stood at the 
crest of the hill looking down on 
the Hospital. It was half a mile away 
and blazed with light. Behind and 
to either side were other lights, the 
lights of houses, none within half a 
mile of the Hospital. Against their 
general glow he saw the black tongue 
of forest he’d noticed that morning. 

In a direction not quite opposite to 
the dark, sprawling line of trees, a 
straighter line of light ran from the 
Hospital to a cluster of buildings at 
the perimeter of the bare region. A 
supply road. 



He could reach the trees by moving 
along the edge of town. The trees 
would give him cover until he reach- 
ed the wall . but it seemed a 
poor risk. Why would Implementa- 
tion leave that one line of cover 
across a bare, flat protective field? 
That strip of forest must be loaded 
with detection equipment. 

He started across the rock on his 
belly. 

He stopped frequently. It was tir- 
ing, moving like this. Worse than 
that, what was he going to do when 
he got inside? The Hospital was big, 
and he knew nothing about the in- 
terior. The lighted windows bothered 
him. Didn’t the Hospital ever sleep? 
The stars shone bright and cold. 
Each time he stopped to rest, the 
Hospital was a little closer. 

So was the wall that surrounded 
it. It leaned outward, and on this 
side there was no break at all. 

He was a hundred yards from the 
wall when he found the wire. There 
were big metal pegs to hold it off 
the ground, pegs a foot high and 
thirty yards apart, driven into the 
rock. The wire itself was bare cop- 
pery metal strung taut a few inches 
off the ground. Matt had not touched 
it. He crossed it very carefully, stay- 
ing low but not touching the wire at 
any time. 

Faintly there came the sound of 
alarm bells ringing inside the wall. 
Matt stopped where he was. Then 
he turned and was over the wire in 
one leap. When he hit the ground 
he didn’t move. His eyes were closed 
tight. He felt the faint touch of 
numbness which meant a sonic 
beam. Evidently he was out of range. 



52 



IF 




He risked a look behind him. Four 
searchlights hunted him across the 
bare rock. The wall was lousy with 
police. 

He turned away, afraid they’d see 
his face shining. There were whirring 
sounds. Mercy-bullets falling all 
around him, slivers of glassy chemi- 
cal which dissolved in blood. They 
weren’t as accurate as lead pellets, 
but one must find him soon. 

A light pinned him. And another, 
and a third. 

From the wall came a voice. “Cease 
fire.” The whir of anesthetic slivers 
ended. The voice spoke again, bored, 
authoritative, tremendously amplified. 
“Stand up, you. You may as well 
walk, but we’ll carry you if we have 
to.” 

Matt wanted to burrow like a rab- 
bit. But even a rabbit wouldn’t have 
made headway in the pitted, dusty 
stone. He sto^ up with his han^ 
in the air. 

There was no sound, no motion. 

One of the lights swung away 
from him. Then the others. They 
moved in random arcs for awhile, 
crossing the protective rock field with 
swooping blobs of light. Then, one 
by one, they went out. 

The amplified voice spoke again. 
It sounded faintly puzzled. “What 
set off the alarms?” 

Another voice, barely audible in 
the quiet night. “Don’t know, sir.” 

“Maybe a rabbit. All right, break 
it up.” 

Tlie figures on the wall disappear- 
ed. Matt was left standing all alone 
with his hands in the air. After 
awhile he put them down and walked 
away. 



T he man was tall and thin, with a 
long face and a short mouth and 
no expression. His Implementation 
police uniform could not have been 
cleaner nor better pressed if he’d 
donned it a moment ago for the first 
time. He sat beside the door, bored 
and used to it, a man who had spent 
half his life sitting and waiting. 
Every fifteen minutes or so he 
would get up to look at the coffin. 

Seemingly the coffin had been built 
for Gilgamesh or Paul Bunyan. It 
was oak, at least on the outside. The 
eight gauge dials along one edge ap- 
peared to have been pirated from 
somewhere else and attached to the 
coffin by a carpenter of only moder- 
ate skill. The long-headed man would 
stand up, go to the coffin, stand 
over the dials for a minute. Some- 
thing could go wrong, after all. Then 
he would have to act in a hurry. 
But nothing ever did, and he would 
return to his chair and wait some 
more. 

Problem: 

Polly Toumquist’s mind holds in- 
formation you need. How to get it? 

The mind is the body. The body 
is the mind. 

Drugs would interfere with her 
metabolism. They mi^t harm her. 
You’d be willing to risk it, but you’re 
not allowed drugs anyway. 

Torture? You could damage a few 
fingernails, bend a few bones. But 
it wouldn’t stop there. Pain affects 
the adrenal glands, and the adrenal 
glands affect everything. Sustained 
pain can have a savage, even per- 
manent effect on a body needed for 
medical supplies. Besides, torture is 
unethical.

Friendly persuasion? You coidd 
offer her a deal. Her life, and re- 
settlement in some other region of 
the Plateau, for anything you want 
to know. You’d like that, and the 
organ banks are full .... But she 
won’t deaL You’ve seen them before. 
You can tell. 

So you give her a nice rest. 

Polly Toumquist was a soul alone 
in space. Less than that; for there 
was nothing around her that could 
have been identified as “space.” No 
heat, no cold, no pressure, no light, 
no darkness, no hunger, no thirst, no 
sound. 

She had tried to concentrate on 
the sound of her heartbeat, but even 
that had disappeared. It was too 
regular. Her mind had edited it out. 
Similarly with the darkness behind 
her closed, bandaged eyelids: the 
darkness was uniform, and she no 
longer sensed it. She could strain her 
muscles against the soft, swaddling 
bandages that bound her, but she 
sensed no result, for the slack was 
small fractions of an inch. Her 
mouth was partly open; she could 
neither open it further, nor close it 
on the foam rubber mouthpiece. She 
could not bite her tongue, nor find 
it. In no way could she produce the 
sensation of pain. The ineffable 
peace of the coffin cure wrapped 
her in its tender folds and carried 
her, screaming silently, into nothing- 
ness. 

hat happened? 

He sat at the edge of the grass 
on the hill above the Hospital. His 
eyes were fixed on its blazing win- 
dows. His fist beat against his knee. 



What happened? They had me. 
They had me! 

He had walked away. Bewildered, 
helpless, beaten, he h^ waited, for 
the magnified voice to shout its or- 
ders. And nothing happened. It was 
as if they had forgotten him. He had 
walked away with the feel of death 
at his back, waiting for the numb- 
ness of a sonic stun beam or the 
prick of a mercy-bullet or the roar 
of the officer’s voice. 

Gradually, against all reason, he 
had sensed that they were not going 
to come for him. 

And then he ran. 

His lungs had stopped their tortur- 
ed laboring many minutes ago, but 
his brain still spun. Perhaps it would 
never stop. He had run until he col- 
lapsed, here at the top of the hill, 
but the fear that drove him was not 
the fear of the organ banks. He had 
fled from an impossible thing, from a 
universe without reason. How could 
he have walked away from that 
plain of death with no eye to watch 
him? It smacked of magic, and he 
was afraid. 

Something had suspended the or- 
dinary laws of the universe to save 
his life. He had never heard of any- 
thing that could do that ... ex- 
cept the Mist Demons. And the Mist 
Demons were a myth. They had told 
him so, when he was old 6nough. 
The Mist Demons were a tale to 
frighten children, like the reverse of 
a Santa Claus. The old wives who 
found powerful beings in the mist 
beyond the edge of the world had 
followed a tradition older than his- 
tory, perhaps as old as Man. But 
nobody believed in the Mist Demons.

IF 




They were like the Belt miners’ 
Church of Finagle, whose prophet 
was Murphy. A half bitter joke. 
Something to swear by. 

They had me and they let me 
go. Why? 

Could they have had a purpose? 
Was there some reason the Hospital 
should let a colonist sneak to its very 
walls, then let him go free? 

Could the organ banks be full? 
But there must be jomeplace they 
could keep a prisoner until there was 
room. 

But if they thought he was a crewl 
Yes, that was iti A human figure 
on Alpha Plateau — of course they’d 
assume he was crew. But so what? 
Surely someone would have come to 
question him. 

Matt began pacing a tight circle 
at the top of the low hill. His head 
whirled. He’d walked to certain death 
and been turned loose. By whom? 
Why? And what did he do next? 
Go back and give them another 
chance? Walk to the Alpha-Beta 
bridge and hope nobody would see 
him sneaking across? Fly down the 
cliff, vigorously flapping his arms? 

The awful thing was that he didn’t 
know it wouldn’t work. Magic, magic. 

Hood had talked about magic. 

No, he hadn’t. He’d practically 
turned purple denying that magic 
was involved. He’d been talking 
about — psychic powers. And Matt 
had been so involved in watching 
Polly that he couldn’t remember any- 
thing he’d said. 

It was very bad luck* Because 
this was his only out. He had to 
assume that he had a psychic power, 
though he had not the remotest idea 



what that implied. At least it put a 
name to what had happened. 

“I’ve got a psychic power,” Matt 
announced. His voice rang with 
queer precision in the quiet night. 

Fine. So? If Hood had gone into 
detail on the nature of psychic pow- 
ers, Matt couldn’t remember. But 
he could fairly well drop the idea 
of flying down the Alpha-Beta cliff. 
Whatever else was true of Man’s 
unexplored mental powers, they must 
be consistent. Matt could remember 
the feeling that he wouldn’t be no- 
ticed if he didn’t want to be, but he 
had never flown, nor even dreamed 
of flying. 

He ought to talk to Hood. 

But Hood was in the Hospital. He 
might be dead already. 

Well 

M att had been eleven years old 
when Genghis, or Dad, 
brought two charms home for gifts. 
They were model cars, just the right 
size for charm bracelets, and they 
glowed in the dark. Matt and Jeanne 
had loved them at sight and for- 
ever. 

One night they had left the 
charms in a closet for several hours, 
thinkin g they would grow brighter 
when they “got used to the dark.” 
When Jeanne opened the closet they 
had lost all their glow. 

Jeanne was near tears. Matt’s 
reaction was different. If darkness 
robbed the charms of their powers — 
He hung them next to a light 
bulb for an hour. When he turned 
off the light they glowed like little 
blue lamps .... 

A tide of small, loosely packed

clouds was spreading across the stars. 
In all directions the town lights had 
gone out; all but the lights of the 
Hospital. The Plateau slept in a pro- 
found silence. 

Well . he’d tried to sneak into 
the Hospital. He’d been caught. But 
when he stood up in the glare of 
spotlight, they couldn’t see him. The 
why of it was just as magical as be- 
fore, but he thought he was begin- 
ning to see the how of it. 

He’d have to risk it. Matt began 
to walk. 

He’d never planned for it to go 
this far. If only he’d been stopped 
before it was too late .... But it 
was too late, and he had the sense 
to know it. 

Strictly speaking, he should have 
been wearing something bright. A 
blue shirt with a tangerine sweater, 
iridescent green pants, a scarlet cape 
with an “S” enclosed in a yellow 
triangle. And . rimm ed glasses? 
It had been a long time since grade 
school. Never mind; he’d have to go 
as he was. 

A good thing he liked flamboyant 
gestures. 

He skirted the edge of the bare 
region until he reached the houses. 
Presently he was walking through 
dark streets. The houses were fas- 
cinating and strange. He would have 
enjoyed seeing them by daylight. 
What manner of people lived in 
them? Colorful, idle, happy, eternal- 
ly young and healthy. He would 
certainly have liked to be one of 
them now. 

But he noticed a peculiar thing 
about the houses. Heterogeneous as 
they were in form, color, style, build- 



ing material, they had one thing in 
common. Always they faced away 
from the Hospital. 

As if the Hospital inspired them 
with fear. Or guilt. 

There were lights ahead. Matt 
walked faster. He had been walking 
for half an hour now. Yes, there 
was the supply road, lit bright as day 
by two close-spaced lines of street 
lamps. A broken white line ran down 
the curving middle. 

Matt stepped out to the white line 
and began following it toward the 
Hospital. 

Again his shoulders were un- 
naturally rigid, as with the fear 
of death from behind. But the 
danger was all before him. The 
organ banks were the most humiliat- 
ing imaginable form of deadi. Yet 
Matt feared something that was much 
worse. 

Men had been released from the 
Hospital to tell of their trials. Not 
many, but they could talk. Matt 
could guess a little of what waited 
for him. 

They would see him, they would 
fire mercy-bullets into him, they 
would carry him on a stretcher into 
the Hospit^. When he woke he would 
be taken to his first and last inter- 
view with the dread Castro. The 
Head’s burning eyes would look in- 
to his, and he would rumble, “Keller, 
eh? Yes, we had to take your uncle 
apart. Well, Keller? You walked up 
here like you thought you were a 
crew with an appointment. What did 
you think it was you were doing, 
Keller?” 

And what was he going to say to 
that?

X 



A sleep, Jesus Pietro looked ten 
years older. His defenses — his 
straight back, tight muscles, and con- 
troled features — were relaxed. His 
startling pale eyes were closed. His 
carefully combed white hair was 
messy, showing the bare scalp over 
which it had been carefully combed. 
He slept alone, separated from his 
wife by a door which was never 
locked. Sometimes he thrashed in his 
sleep, and sometimes, ridden by in- 
somnia, he stared at the ceiling with 
his arms folded and muttered to 
himself; which was why Nadia slept 
next door. But tonight he lay quiet. 

He could have looked thirty again, 
with help. Inside his aging skin he 
was in good physical shape. He had 
good wind, thanks partly to his bor- 



rowed lung; his muscles were hard 
beneath loose wrinkles and deposits 
of fat, and his digestion was good. 
His teeth, all transplants, were per- 
fect. Give him new skin, new scalp, 
a new liver, replace a number of 
sphincter and other autonomic 
muscles .... 

But that would take a special or- 
der from the crew congress. It would 
be a kind of testimonial, and he 
would accept it if it were offered, but 
he wasn’t going to fight for it. Trans- 
plants and the giving of transplants 
were the right of the crew and their 
most powerful reward. And Jesus 
Pietro was . not squeamish, but 
somehow reluctant to exchange parts 
of himself for parts of some stranger. 
It would be like losing part of his 
ego. Only the fear of death had made 
him accept a new lung, years ago. 





He slept quietly for some time. 

And things be^n to add up. 

Polly Toumquist*s films; someone 
had slipped through his net, night be- 
fore last. Keller’s getaway last night. 
A gnawing suspicion, only an intui- 
tion as yet, that ramrobot package 
#143 was even more important than 
anyone had guessed. Wrinkled, un- 
comfortable sheets. His blankets, 
which were a trifle too heavy. The 
fact that he had forgotten to brush 
his teeth. A mental picture of Keller 
diving head-down for the mist . 
it kept coming back to haunt him. 
Faint noises from outside, from the 
wall, noises already an hour old, 
noises which hadn’t awakened him 
but which were still unexplained. His 
twinges of lust for the girl in the cof- 
fin cure, and the guilt which followed. 
His temptation to see that ancient 
brainwashing technique for his own 
private purposes, to make the rebel 
girl love him for a time. Adultery! 
More guilt. 

Temptations. Escaped prisoners. 
Hot, wrinkled bedclothes. 

No use. He was awake. 

He lay rigidly on his back, arms 
folded, glaring into the dark. No 
use fighting it. Last night had fouled 
up his internal clock; he’d eaten 
breakfast at twelve-thirty. Why did he 
keep thinking of Keller? 

(Head down over the mist, with 
the fans pushing hard on the seat of 
his pants. Hell above and Heaven be- 
low, going up into the unknown; lost 
forever, destroyed utterly. The dream 
of the Hindu, realized in physical 
form. The peace of total dissolution.) 

Jesus Pietro rolled over and turn- 
ed on the phone. 



A strange voice said, “Hospital — 
sir.” 

“Who is this?” 

“Master Sergeant Leonard V. 
Watts, sir. Night duty.” 

“What’s happening at the Hos- 
pital, Master Sergeant?” It was not 
an unusual question. Jesus Pietro had 
asked it scores of times at early morn- 
ing hours during the last ten years. 

Watts’ voice was crisp. “Let me 
see. You left at seven, sir. At seven- 
thirty Major Jansen ordered the re- 
lease of the deadheads we picked up 
last night, the ones without ear mikes. 
Major Jansen left at nine. At ten- 
thirty Sergeant Helios reported that 
all the deadheads had been returned 
to their homes. Mmmm . .” Shuf- 
fling of papers in the background. 
“All but two of the prisoners ques- 
tioned today have been executed and 
stored away. The medical-supplies 
section informs us that the banks will 
be unable to handle new material un- 
til further notice. Do you want the 
list of executions, ^sir?” 

“No.” 

“Coffin cure proceeding satisfac- 
torily. No adverse medical reactions 
from suspect. Grounds ref)orts a false 
alarm at twelve oh eight, caused by a 
rabbit blundering into the electric eye 
barrier. No evidence of anything 
moving on the grounds.” 

“Then how do they know it was a 
rabbit??” 

“Shall I ask, sir?” 

“No. They guessed, of course. 
Good night.” Jesus Pietro turned on 
his back and waited for sleep. 

His thoughts drifted .... 

He and Nadia hadn’t been getting 
together much lately. Shouldn’t he

start taking testosterone shots A trans- 
plant wouldn’t be necessary; many 
glands were not put in suspended 
animation, but were kept running, as 
it were, with a complex and exact 
food/ blood supply and a system for 
extracting the hormones. He could 
put up with the inconvenience of 
shots. 

Though his father hadn’t. 

A younger Jesus Pietro had spent 
much time wondering about his own 
conception. Why had the old man 
insisted that the doctors connect the 
VOS deferens during his gonad trans- 
plant? An older Jesus Pietro thought 
he knew. Even sixty years ago, des- 
pite the centuries-old tradition of 
large families, the Plateau had been 
mostly uninhabited. Breeding must 
have seemed a duty to Haneth Cas- 
tro, as it had to all his ancestors. 
Besides . how must the old man 
have felt, knowing that at last he 
could no longer sire children? 

An older Jesus Pietro thought he 
knew. 

His thoughts were wandering far, 
blurred with impending sleep. Jesus 
Pietro turned on his side, drowsily 
comfortable. 

Rabbit? 

Why not? From the woods. 

Jesus Pietro turned on his other 
side. 

What was a rabbit doing in the 
trapped woods? 

What was anything bigger than a 
field mouse doing in the woods? 

What was a rabbit doing on Alpha 
plateau? \^^at would it eat? 

Jesus Pietro cursed and readied 
for the phone. To Master Sergeant 
Watts he said, “Take an order. To- 



morrow I want the woods searched 
thoroughly and dien deloused. If they 
find anytiiing as big as a rat 1 want 
to know about it.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“That alarm tonight. What sector?” 
“Let me see. Where the — ah. 
Sector six, sir.” 

“Six? That’s nowhere near the 
woods.” 

“No, sir.” 

And that was that. “Good night. 
Master Seregant,” said Jesus Pietro, 
and hung up. Tomorrow they’d search 
the woods. Implementation was be- 
coming decidedly slack, Jesus Pietro 
decided. He’d have to do something 
about it. 

T he wall slanted outward, twelve 
feet of concrete cross-laced with 
barbed wire. The gate slanted too, 
at the same angle, perhaps twelve de- 
grees from vertical. Solid cast iron 
it was, built to slide into the con- 
crete wall, which was twelve feet 
thick. The gate was closed. Lights 
from inside lit the upper edges of 
wall and gate and tinged the sky 
above. 

Matt stood under the wall, looking 
up. He couldn’t climb over. If they 
saw him they’d open the gate for him 
. but they mustn*t see him. 

They hadn’t yet. The train of 
logic had worked. If something that 
glows in the dark stops glowing when 
it’s been in the dark too long, hang 
it near a light. If a car goes up 
when it’s rightside up, itH go down 
fast when it’s upside down. If the 
cops see you when you’re hiding, but 
don’t when you’re not, they*!! ignore 
you completely when you walk up

the middle of a well lighted road. 
But logic ended here. 

Whatever had helped him wasn’t 
helping him now. 

Matt turned his back on the wall. 
He stood beneath the overhanging 
iron gate, his eyes following the 
straight line of the road to where its 
lights ended. Most of the houses were 
dark now. The land was black all 
the way to the starry horizon. On 
his right the stars were blurred 
along that line, and Matt knew he 
was seeing the top of the void mist. 

The impulse that came then was 
one he never managed to explain, 
even to himself. 

He cleared his throat. “Something 
is helping me,” he said in an alrnost 
normal voice. “I know that. I need 
help to get through this gate. I have 
to get into the Hospital.” 

Noises came from inside the wall, 
the faintest of sounds: regular foot- 
steps, distant voices. They were the 
business of the Hospital, and had 
nothing to do with Matt. 

Outside the wall, nothing changed. 

“Get me in there,” he pleaded, 
to himself or to something outside 
himself. He didn’t know which. He 
knew nothing. 

On the Plateau there was no re- 
ligion. 

But suddenly Matt knew that there 
was just one way to get inside. 

He stepped off the access road and 
began hunting. Presently he found a 
discarded chunk of concrete, dirty 
and uneven. He carried it back and 
began pounding it against the iron 
gate. 

CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! 

A head appeared on the wall. 



^Stop that, you half-witted excuse for 
a colonist bastard!” 

“Let me in.” 

The head remained. “You are a 
colonist.” 

“Right.” 

“Don’t move! Don’t you move a 
muscle!” The man fumbled with 
something on the other side of the 
wall. Both hands appeared, one hold- 
ing a gun, the other a telephone re- 
ceiver. “Hello? Hello? Answer the 
phone, dammit! Watts?^obart. A 
fool of a colonist just came walking 
up to the gate and started pounding 
on it. Yes, a real colonist! \^at do I 
do with him? All right. I’ll ask.” 
The head looked down. You want 
to walk or be carried?” 

“I’ll walk,” said Matt. 

“He says he’ll walk. Why should 
he get his choice? Oh. I guess it’s 
easier at that. Sorry, Watts, I’m a 
Kttle shook. This never happened to 
me before.” 

The gateman hung up. His head 
and gun continued to peer down at 
Matt. After a moment the gate slid 
back into the wall. 

“Come on through,” said the gate- 
man. “Fold your hands behind your 
neck.” 

Matt did. A gatehouse had been 
built against the wall on the inside. 
The gateman came down a short 
flight of steps. “Stay ahead of me,” 
he ordered. “Start walking. That’s 
the front entrance, where all the 
lights are. See? Walk toward that.” 
It would have been hard to miss 
the front entrance. The great square 
bronze door topped a fli^t of broad, 
shallow steps flanked by Doric pil- 
lars. The steps and the pillars were

THE PETRIFIED WORLD 



by ROBERT SHECKLEY 



Lanigan's dream was a nightmare 
— and if was actually coming true! 





L anigan dreamed the dream again 
and managed to wake himself 
with a hoarse cry. He sat upright in 
bed and glared around him into the 
violet darkness. His teeth clenched 
and his lips were pulled back into 
a spastic grin. Beside him he felt 
his wife, Estelle, stir and sit up. 
■ Lanigan didn’t look at her. Still 
caught in his dream, he waited for 
tangible proofs of the world. 

^ A chair slowly drifted across his 
field of vision and fetched up against 
, the wall with a quiet thump. Lani- 
1 gan’s face relaxed slightly. Then Es- 
telle’s hand was on his arm — a 
touch meant to be soothing, but 
which burned like lye. 

“Here,” she said. “Drink this.” 
“No,” Lanigan said. “I’m all 
right now.” 

“Drink it anyhow.” 

“No, really. I really am all right.” 
For now he was completely out 
of the grip of the nightmare. He 
was himself again, and the world 



was its habitual self. That was very 
precious to Lanigan; he didn’t want 
to let go of it just now, not even for 
the soothing release of a sedative. 
“Was it the same dream?” Estelle 
asked him. 

“Yes, just the same .... I don’t 
want to talk about it.” 

“All right,” Estelle said. (She is 
humoring me, Lanigan thought. I 
frighten her. I frighten myself.) 

She asked, “Hon, what time is it?” 
Lanigan looked at his watch. “Six- 
fifteen.” But as he said it, the hour 
hand jumped convulsively forward. 
“No, it’s five to seven.” 

“Can you get back to sleep?” 

“I don’t think so,” Lanigan said. 
“I think I’ll stay up.” 

“Fine, dear,” Estelle said. She 
yawned, closed her eyes, opened them 
again and asked, “Hon, don’t you 
think it might be a good idea if you 
called — ” 

“I have an appointment with him 
for twelve-ten,” Lanigan said. 



63 



“That’s fine,” Estelle said. She 
dosed her eyes again. Sleep came 
over her while Lanigan watched. Her 
auburn hair turned a faint blue, and 
she sighed once, heavily. 

Lanigan got out of bed and dress- 
ed. He was, for the most part, a 
large man, unusually easy to recog- 
nize. His features were curiously dis- 
tinct. He had a rash on his neck. 
He was in no other way outstanding, 
except that he had a recurring dream 
which was driving him insane. 

H e spent the next few hours on 
his front porch watching stars 
go nova in the dawn sky. 

Later, he went out for a stroll. As 
luck would have it, he ran into 
George Torstein just two blocks from 
his house. Several months ago, in 
an incautious moment, he had told 
Torstein about his dream. Torstein 
was a bluff, hearty fellow, a great 
believer in self-help, discipline, prac- 
ticality, common sense and other dull 
virtues. His hard-headed, no-nonsense 
attitude had come as a momentary 
relief to Lanigan. But now it acted 
as an abrasive. Men like Torstein 
were undoubtedly the salt of the 
earth and the backbone of the coun- 
try; but for Lanigan, wrestling with 
the impalpable and losing, Torstein 
had grown from a nuisance into a 
horror. 

“Well, Tom, how’s the boy?” Tor- 
stein greeted him. 

“Fine,” Lanigan said, “just fine.” 
He nodded pleasantly and began to 
walk away under a melting green sky. 
But one did not escape from Torstein 
so easily. 

“Tom, boy. I’ve been thinking 



about your problem,” Torstein said. 
“I’ve been quite disturbed about 
you.” 

“Well, that’s very nice of you,” 
Lanigan said. “But really, you 
shouldn’t concern yourself — ” 

“I do it because I want to ” Tor- 
' stein said, speaking the simple, de- 
plorable truth. “I take an interest in 
people, Tom. Always have, ever since 
I was a kid. And you and I’ve been 
fri^ds and neighbors for a long 
time.” 

“That’s true enough,” Lanigan 
said numbly. (The worst thing about 
needing help w^ having to accept 
it.) 

“Well, Tom, I think what would 
really help you would be a little 
vacation.” 

Torstein had a simple prescription 
for everything. Since he practiced 
soul-doctoring without a license, he 
was always careful to prescribe a drug 
you could buy over the counter. 

“I really can’t afford a vacation 
this month,” Lanigan said. (The sky 
was ochre and pink now; three pines 
had withered; an aged oak had turn- 
ed into a youthful cactus.) 

Torstein laughed heartily. “Boy, 
you can’t afford not to take a vaca- 
tion just now! Did you ever consider 
that?” 

“No, I guess not.” 

“Well, consider it! You’re tired, 
tense, all keyed-up. You’ve been 
working too hard.” 

“I’ve been on leave of absence all 
week,” Lanigan said. He glanced at 
his watch. The gold case had turned 
to lead, but the time seemed accurate 
enough. Nearly two hours had passed 
since he had begun this conversation. 



64 



IF 




44Tt isn’t good enough,” Torstein 
A was saying. “You’ve stayed 
ri^t here in town, right close to ycmr 
work. You need to get in touch with 
nature. Tom, when was the last time 
you went camping?” 

“Camping? I don’t think I’ve ever 
gone camping.” 

“There, you see! Boy, you’ve got 
to put yourself back in touch with 
real things. Not streets and buildings, 
but mountains and rivers.” 

Lanigan looked at his watch again 
and was relieved to see it turn back 
to gold. He was glad; he had paid 
sixty dollars for that case. 

“Trees and lakes,” Torstein was 
rhapsodizing. “The feel of grass 
growing under your feet, the sight of 
tall black mountains marching across 
a golden sky — ” 

Lanigan shook his head. “I’ve been 
in the country, George. It doesn’t do 
anything for me.” 

Torstein was obstinate. “You must 
get away from artificialities.” 

“It all seems equally artificial,” 
Lanigan said, ‘Trees or buildings — 
what’s the difference?” 

“Men make buildings,” Torstein 
intoned rather piously, “but God 
makes trees.” 

Lanigan had his doubts about both 
propositions, but he wasn’t going to 
tell them to Torstein. “You might 
have something there,” he said. “I’ll 
think about it.” 

“You do that,” Torstein said. “It 
happens I know the perfect place. 
It’s in Maine, Tom, and it’s right 
near this little lake — ” 

Torstein was a master of the in- 
terminable description. Luckily for 
Lanigan, there was a diversion. 



Across the street, a house burst into 

flames. 

“Hey, whose house is that?” Lan- 
igan asked. 

“Makelby’s,” Torstein said. “That’s 
his third fire this month.” 

“Maybe we ought to give the 
alarm.” 

“You’re right. I’ll do it my^lf,” 
Torstein said. “Remember what I 
told you about that place in Maine, 
Tom.” 

Torstein turned to go, and some- 
thing rather humorous happened. As 
he stepped over the pavement, the 
concrete liquified under his left foot. 
Caught unawares, Torstein went in 
ankle-deep. His forward motion 
pitched him head-first into the street. 

Tom hurried to help him out be- 
fore the concrete hardened again. 
“Are you aU right?” he asked. 

“Twisted my damned ankle,” Tor- 
stein muttered. “It’s okay, I can 
walk.” 

He limped off to report the fire. 
Lanigan stayed and watched. He 
judged the fire had been caused by 
spontaneous combustion. In a few 
minutes, as he had expected, it put 
itself out by spontaneous decombus- 
tion. 

One shouldn’t be pleased by an- 
other man’s misfortunes; but Lani- 
gan couldn’t help chuckling about 
Torstein’s twisted ankle. Not even 
the sudden appearance of flood wa- 
ters on Main Street could mar his 
good spirits. He beamed at something 
like a steamboat with yellow stacks 
that went by in the sky. 

Then he remembered his dream, 
and the panic began again. He walk- 
ed quickly to the doctor’s office. 



THE PETRIFIED WORLD 



65 




D r. Sampson's office was small 
and dark this week. The jold 
gray sofa was gone; in its place were 
two Louis Quinze chairs and a ham- 
mock. The worn carpet had finally 
rewoven itself, and there was a cig- 
arette bum on the puce ceiling. But 
the portrait of Andretti was in its 
usual place on the wall, and the big 
free-form ash try was scrupulously 
clean. 

The inner door opened, and Dr. 
Sampson’s head popped out. “Hi,” 
he said. “Won’t be a minute.” His 
head popped back in again. 

Sampson was as good as his word. 
It took him exactly three seconds by 
Lanigan’s watch to do whatever he 
had to do. One second later Lanigan 
was stretched out on the leather 
couch with a fresh paper doily under 
his head. And Dr. Sampson was say- 
ing, “Well, Tom, how have things 
been going?” 

“The same,” Lanigan said. 
“Worse.” 

“The dream?” 

Lanigan nodded. 

“Let’s just run through it again.” 
“I’d rather not,” Lanigan said. 
“Afraid?” 

“More afraid than ever.” 

“Even now?” 

“Yes. Especially now.” 

There was a moment of therapeu- 
tic silence. Then Dr. Sampson said, 
“You’ve spoken before of your fear 
of this dream; but you’ve never told 
me why you fear it so.” 

“Well .... It sounds so silly.” 
Sampson’s face was serious, quiet, • 
composed: the face of a man who 
found nothing silly, who was con- 
stitutionally incapable of finding any- 



thing silly. It was a pose, perhaps, 
but one which Lanigan found reas- 
suring. 

“All right, m tell you,” Lanigan 
said abmptly. Then he stopped. 

“Go on,” Dr. Sampson said. 

“Well, it’s because I believe that 
somehow, in some way I don’t un- 
derstand . .” 

“Yes, go on,” Sampson said. 

“Well, that somehow the world 
of my dream is becoming the real 
world.” He stopped again, then 
went on with a rush. “And that 
some day 1 am going to wake up 
and find myself in that world. And 
then that world will have become 
the real one and this world will be 
the dream.” 

He turned to see how this mad 
revelation had affected Sampson. If 
the doctor was disturbed, he didn’t 
show it. He was quietly lifting his 
pipe with the smoiddering tip of his 
left forefinger. He blew out his 
forefinger and said, “Yes, please 
go on.” 

“Go on? But that’s it, that’s the 
whole thingl” 

A spot the size of a quarter ap- 
peared on Sampson’s mauve 
carpet. It darkened, thickened, grew 
into a small fruit tree. Sampson 
picked one of the purple pods, sniff- 
ed it, then set it down on his desk. 
He looked at Lanigan sternly, sad- 
ly- 

“You’ve told me about your 
dream-world before, Tom.” 

Lanigan nodded. 

“We have discussed it, traced its 
origins, analyzed its meaning for 
you. In past months we have leam- 

IF 



66 




ed, I believe, why you need to crip- 
ple yourself with this nightmare 
fear.” 

Lanigan nodded unhappily. 

“Yet you refuse the insights,” 
Sampson said. “You forget each 
time that your dream-world is a 
dreamy nothing but a dream, oper- 
ated by arbitrary dream-laws which 
you have invented to satisfy your 
psychic needs.” 

“I wish I could believe that,” 
Lanigan said. “The trouble is my 
dream-world is so damnably reason- 
able.” 

“Not at all,” Sampson said. “It is 
just that your delusion is hermetic, 
self-enclosed and self-sustaining. A 
man’s actions are based upon cer- 
tain assumptions about the nature 
of the world. Grant his assumptions, 
and his behavior is entirely reason- 
able. But to change those assump- 
tions, those fundamental axioms, is 
nearly impossible. For example, how 
do you prove to a man that he is 
not being controlled by a secret ra- 
dio which only he can hear?” 

' “I see the problem,” Lanigan 
muttered. “And that’s me?” 

“Yes, Tom. That, in effect, is 
you. You want me to prove to you 
that this world is real, and that the 
world of your dream is false. You 
propose to give up your fantasy if 
I supply you with the necessary 
proofs.” 

“Yes, exactly!” Lanigan cried. 

“But you see, I can’t supply 
them,” Sampson said. “The nature 
of the world is apparent, but un- 
provable.” 

Lanigan thought for a while. 
Then he said, “Look, Doc, I’m not 



as sick as the guy with the secret 
radio, am I?” 

“No, you’re not. You’re more 
reasonable, more rational. You have 
doubts about the reality of the 
world; but luckily, you also have 
doubts about the validity of your 
delusion.” 

“Then give it a try,” Lanigan 
said. “I understand your problem; 
but I swear to you. I’ll accept any- 
thing I can possibly bring myself 
to accept.” 

“It’s not my field, really,” Samp- 
son said. *Tlpds sort of thing caUs 
for a metaphysician. I don’t think 
I’d be very skilled at it . .” 

44 /^ive it a try,” Lanigan pleaded. 

vJ “All right, here goes.” Samp- 
son’s forehead wrinkled and ^ed as 
he concentrated. Then he said, “It 
seems to me that we inspect the 
world through our senses, and there- 
fore we must in the final analysis 
accept the testimony of those 
senses.” 

Lanigan nodded, and the doctor 
went on. 

“So, we know that a thing exists 
because our senses tell us it exists. 
How do we check the accuracy of 
our observations? By comparing 
them with the sensory impressions 
of other men. We know that our 
senses don’t lie when other men’s 
senses agree upon the existence of 
the thing in question.” 

Lanigan thought about this, then 
said, “Therefore, the real world 
is simply what most men think it 
is.” 

Sampson twisted his mouth and 
said, “I told you that metaphysics 



THE PETRIFIED WORLD 



67 




was not my forte. Still, I think it is 
an acceptable demonstration.” 

“Yes .... But Doc, suppose all 
of those observw's are wrong? For 
example, suppose there are many 
worlds and many realities, not just 
one? Suppose this is simply one ar- 
bitrary existence out of an infinity 
of existences? Or suppose that the 
nature of reality itself is capable of 
change, and that somehow I am able 
to perceive that change?” 

Sampson sighed, found a little 
green bat fluttering inside his jacket 
and absentmindedly crushed it with 
a ruler. 

“There you are,” he said. “I can’t 
disprove a single one of your sup- 
positions. I think, Tom, that we had 
better run through the entire dream.” 
Lanigan grimaced. “I really would 
rather not. I have a feeling . .” 
“I know you do,” Sampson said, 
smiling faintly. *‘But this will prove 
or disprove it once and for all, 
won’t it?” 

gaesa so,” Lanigan said. He 
took com*ag6 — unwisdy — and 
said, “Wd!, the way it begins, the 
way my dream starts — ” 

Bven as he spoke the horror 
came over him. He felt dizzy, sick, 
terrified. He tries to rise from the 
couch. The doctor’s face ballooned 
over him. He saw a glint of metal, 
heard Sampson saying, “Just try to 
relax . brief seizure ... try to 
think of something pleasant.” 

Then etth^ Lanigan or the world 
or both passed out 

nnl gan and/or the world came 
back to consciousness. Time 
may or may not have passed. Any- 



thing might or might not have hap- 
pened. Lanigan sat up and looked 
at Sampson. 

“How do you fed now?” Samp- 
son asked. 

“I’m all right,” Lanigan said. 
“What happened?” 

“You had a bad moment Take 
it easy for a bit.” 

Lanigan leaned back and tried to 
calm himself. The doctor was sitting 
at his desk, writing notes. Lanigan 
counted to twenty with his eyes 
closed, then opened them cautiously. 
Sampson was still writing notes. 

Lanigan looked around the room, 
counted the five pictures On the 
wall, re-counted them, looked at the 
green carpet, frowned at it, closed 
his eyes again. This time he count- 
ed to fifty. 

“Well, care to talk about it now?” 
Sampson asked, shutting a notebook. 

“No, not just now,” Lanigan said. 
(Five paintings, green carpet.) 

“Just as you please,” the doctor 
said. “I think that our time is just 
about up. But if you’d care to lie 
down in the anteroom — ” 

“No, thanks. I’ll go home,” Lani- 
gan said. 

He stood up, walked across the 
green carpet to the door, looked 
back at the five-paintings and at 
the doctor, who smiled at him en- 
couragingly. Then Lanigan went 
through the door and into the ante- 
room, through the anteroom to the 
outer door and through that and 
down the corridor to the stairs and 
down the stairs to the street. 

He walked and looked at the 
trees, on which green leaves moved 
faintly and predictably in a faint

bree^ze. There was traffic, which 
moved soberly down one side of 
the street and up the other. The sky 
was an unchanging blue, and had 
obviously been so for quite some 
time. 

Dream? He pinched himself. A 
dream pinch? He did not awaken. 
He shouted. An imaginary shout? 
He did not waken. 

He was in the street of the world 
of his nightmare. 

The street at first seemed like any 
normal city street. There were paving 
stones, C 4 TS, people, buildings, a sky 
overhead, a sun in the sky. All per- 
fectly normal. Except that nothing 
was happening. 

The, pavement never once yielded 
beneath his feet. Over there was the 
First National City Bank; it had 
been here yesterday, which was 
bad enough; but worse it would be 
there without fail tomorrow, and 
the day after that, and the year 
after that. The First National City 
Bank (Founded 1892) was gro- 
tesquely devoid of possibilities. It 
would never become a tomb, an 
airplane, the bones of a prehistoric 
monster. Sullenly it would remain 
a building of concrete and steel, 
madly persisting in its fixity until 
men with tools came and tediously 
tore it down. 

Lanigan walked through this pet- 
rified world, under a blue sky that 
oozed a sly white' around the edges, 
teasingly promising something that 
was never delivered. Traffic moved 
implacably to the right, people cross- 
ed at crossings, clocks were within 
minutes of agreement. 



Somewhere between the town lay 
countryside; but Lanigan knew that 
the grass did not grow under one’s 
feet; it simply lay still, growing no 
doubt, but imperceptibly, unusable 
to the senses. And the mountains 
were still tall and black, but they 
were giants stopped in mid-stride. 
They would never march against a 
golden (or purple or green) sky. 

The essence of life, Dr. Sampson 
had once said, is change. The es- 
sence of death is immobility. Even 
a corpse has a vestige of life about 
it as long as its flesh rots, as long 
as maggots still feast on its blind 
eyes and blowflies suck the juices 
from the burst intestines. 

Lanigan looked around at the 
corpse of the world and perceived 
that it was dead. 

H e screamed. He screamed while 
people gathered around and 
looked at him (but didn’t do any- 
thing or become anything), and then 
a policeman came as he was sup- 
posed to (but the sun didn’t change 
shape once), and then an ambu- 
lance came down the invariant 
street (but without trumpets, minus 
strumpets, on four wheels instead 
of a pleasing three or twenty-five) 
and the ambulance men brought 
him to a building which was exactly 
where they expected to find it, and 
there was a great deal of talk by 
people who stood untransformed, 
asking questions in a room with re- 
lentlessly white walls. 

And there was evening and there 
was morning, and it was the first 
day. END

Even the economics of it pleased 
him. You don’t hit the roadhouses 
too often on a mechanic’s pay. Ed 
Lamb at thirty was the archetype 
mechanic: medium height, stocky and 
a little stoop-shouldered. Hanging 
between his brown brushcut and a 
stronig chin was a face in no way 
Femaitable except for its nearly con- 
stant, toothy smile. Ed hked road- 
hous^ women and cycle races — 
which ho occasionaly won. And 
everycHie liked Ed. 

Yesterday he’d been asked a 
favor. He’d been out here after work, 
buzzing around on this same beat- 
up Norton, siupposedly to practice 
but really just off on a joyride, when 
this guy popped out of the woods 
by Braun’s Creek and hailed him. 

“Afternoon,” Ed said as he killed 
the idling engine. 

“Hello. Glad you stopped. We’re 
in an awful jam.” 

“Oh?” Ed looked with frank won- 
der at the man before him. He wore 
a milky plastic coverall, and his 
face was baby smooth, almost fea- 
tureless. His eyes seemed unfocused. 

“Yes, we’ve crashed hack in 
there.” 

“Ed laughed. “Boy, that’s some 
accent American?” 

“American — yes. Well, we’ve 
ruptured our rel tank and have no 
power now, absolutely none, so . 

“Your what?” 

/ 



‘Tank, just a tank. We need a 
fusor.” 

“Gaww-dam, but I hardly read 
you, friend. Y’better show me.” 

S o the stranger led him through 
the woods to a -ham-sized ma- 
diine and another oddly clad man, 
both of whom were sitting awkward- 
ly in a clearing. 

The men were friendly enough, Ed 
discovered, quite ready and even 
eager to shoot the breeze. In the 
course of easy conversation, their 
accents seemed to diminish until Ed 
began to hear the huffy vowels of 
his own Nova Scotian neighbors. 

It turned out that Ralph and 
Dirk were American astronauits 
who’d crash landed their vehicle 
when a tank seam or something let 
go upon entering the atmosphere. 
Would Ed help them out, get them 
an oxy^cetyiene torch, perhaps do 
the job for them? They'd pay — 
oh, Ed didn’t care. Always gM to 
give the Yanks a hand. And sure, 
he could understand the secrecy. 
Wouldn’t do to have the Chinese 
dropping in for a few photos, hell 
no. Anything y’wont, fellas, be back 
tomorrow. Damn, but there’s a cou- 
ple of swell guys. 

So today Ed found himself back 
on the secondary — a laughable 
euphemism for dirt — road that 
followed Braun’s Creek. Half a mile 
along it he spotted Dirk sitting on 
a guardrail. 

“Hi. Got the torch I see.” 
“Nothing to it,” puffed Ed as he 
heaved the heavily laden bike back 
on its stand. They went through 
the woods to the fallen ship. Piled

IF 




outside were a dozen heavy look- 
ing cubes, perhaps two feet on a 
side. 

“Cleaning house?” 

“Hardly,” Dirk chuckled. “Had 
to get those out of the tank before 
you welded it up. They’re, uh, flam- 
mable.” 

“Thanks for that,” Ed replied, 
grinning at the other’s heavily im- 
plied understatement. But he was 
looking with mild concern at the 
Yank flier. 

“What’s the matter?” 

“Wdl, maybe I’m blind or hung 
over but your face has changed.” 
He frown^. “And you look . 
smaller somehow than yesterday.” 

I>irk laughed nervously. “Hell, Ed, 
it’s just the shoes. Different shoes.” 
He bent over, way over, to point to 
his silvery plastic boots. When he 
stood up from the awkward move- 
ment, he seemed a fraction taller. 
But Ed couldn’t <be sure and besides; 
the whole thing was ridiculous. 

“Oof,” grunted Ralph a few min- 
utes later as he and Ed hauled the 
tanks inside the ship. “Quite the 
antiques, these, ch?” They led him 
along a catwalk past several care- 
fully closed hatches — security 
y’know — to an unadorned space 
rather reminiscent of a boier room. 
It was dominated by a massive cubic 
tank, down whose near comer ran 
a long jagged crack. 

“That’s it.” 

“No problem. What metal you 
got there?” asked Ed, sorting through 
his wdding rods. 

“Oobak-chrome.” 

“You’re kidding. Hell, I haven’t 
got any rods like that.” ' 



“Uh-oh. How about flux, got 
that? Maybe I can dig up a chunk 
of the alloy to make the bead.” 

I t wasn’t as neat a job as Ed Lamb 
would have liked, but then one 
doesn’t normally melt down a hatch 
hinge for bead material. And how- 
ever unprofessional it may have 
looked, he philosophized, it was tight. 
He was sure of that. 

“Thanks a million, Ed,” said 
Ralph with honest feeling. “You’ve 
really pulled us out of a bole.” 
“Sure did,” said the other flier. 
“Listen, Ed, take something for it, 
will you? We’ve no money aboard, 
but how about some tools? Here, 
look.” Dirk opened a panel in the 
wall, exposing an array of well used, 
well kept hand tools, a few cans of 
oil and some plasticky-looking rags. 
Ed Lamb’s mechame’s eyes lit up. 
One adjustable diameter pin spanner 
in there was just, well, just beauti- 
ful. 

But he couldn’t take it No sir, this 
bad started out as a favor, and it 
would end one. 

“Nice of you but thanks anyway, 
guys. I’ve got most of that stuff as 
it is.” 

“Aw, c’mon, take something,” 
Ralph implored, 

“Well, okay.” The Norton needed 
oil, so Ed scooped up one of the 
cans. “Forty weight?” 

“Is that all you’re taking? Hard 
Man Lamb, they must call you,” 
sighed Dirk. “But it’s universal vis- 
cosity. I’m sure it’s okay for 
the bike, if that’s what you’re think- 
mg. 

“Good. Say, are you guys leaving

righit away? I’d kinda like to see 
this crate take off.” 

“Not too soon,” Ralph answered 
quickly. “After dark.” 

“Oh. Well then, guess I’ll shove, 
off. Give me a hand with the 
tanks?” 

As the big motorcycle crackled 
out of sight, the two fliers turned 
back to their machine. In the course 
of the walk back, each grew shorter 
by a foot and thinner by sixty 
pounds. What had been passably 
aduk human heads became beautiful- 
ly sculptured childlike things, hair- 
less and golden-eyed. Shimmering 
faintly, their clothing metamorphosed 
along with them. 

r te Vegan that was Dirk sighed 
and dropped tiredly into -the 
skipper's hammock as his partner ac- 
tivated the navigational holograph. 

"'That was rough,” Dirk subvoca- 
lized. 

“And how. But I don’t think he 
knew. A little suspicious perhaps, 
that’s alL I’m going to transluce us. 
Ready?" 

“Ready," answered the pilot, and 
the bulkheads turned to misty glass. 
“He wasn’t unintelligent by any 
means, you know. Surprising that 
they ooidd come so far without hit- 
ting on either time technology or in- 
terpretational hypnosis.” 

“Isn’t it?" said the navigator. “But 
it seems like a good culture, and 
I’m gjlad we stumbled on it. Let’s 
record it with Council for a tech 
assist in a few hundred generations.” 
“Few hundred? I wonder,” said 
the Diik-Vegan thoughtfully. “May- 
be.” He turned to his controls. “I’ve 



got the rel field up. Let’s warp 
straight for home and get a decent 
job done on that tank.” 

“Right. Listen, you’ve got me wor- 
ried now,” Ralph said. “I don’t know 
if we should let him' have that iubri- 
cant. Maybe he should’ve taken 
something else.” 

“We’ll see,” was the thoughtful 
reply. “Keep them on the monitor. 
We can always patch it up. Here 
we go.” 

The Vegan ship flickered from 
translucence to nothing at all. 

E d Lamb hadn’t raced the Norton 
much that year. People were 
winning rough-country contests on 
lighter, more modern bikes with 
yammering little two-stroke engines. 
But the Big Black Bus was a whale 
of a lot more fun to ride, and one 
bright race-day morning he decided 
what the hell, let’s just write this 
one off to good times. 

It was a typical wildcat race. Drop 
a fivespot in the kitty, fellas, start 
right here and yonder’s where to 
aim. A dozen battered bikes lined 
up between a boulder and a tree, 
filling the air with unbelievable 
noises and tear-jerking exhaust 
smoke. Oh, but those two-strokes lay 
down a screen. ‘Yonder’ today hap- 
pened to be up a wooded mountain- 
side toward an unseen hut six miles 
away. Ten minutes before the man 
said Go, Ed emptied a two-quart 
can of funny-feeling yellow oil into 
his crankcase. 

It took him about half a mile to 
feel the difference. Going up a dry 
wash, he broke traction on some 
loose gravel and nearly dropped the 



74 



IF 




bike. He blasted his way out with 
way too much throttle cracked on, 
expecting die old engine to clatter 
horribly in protest. But it didn’t, it 
just hurled Ed up the embankment 
as if he were shot from a bow. 

So. Ed did it again, next chance 
he got, and then again. He could 
not get that engine to break up. No 
more torque than usual, possibly 
less, but the cast iron behemoth 
wound up like an F-86. Ed Lamb 
won the race. 

II 

S tu McNair loved Bonneville. One 
of the reasons he kept his job 
with Castone was that they sent him 
along to Bonnie with the sales boys 
every year as tech advisor. It was a 
fringe benefit most chemical en- 
gineers don’t have, and Stu enjoyed 
it to the hilt. He’d hand out Cas- 
tbne’s racing oil to anyone who’d 
use it, hitch a few fast rides, talk 
with the drivers and generally have 
a good time. And of course he watch- 
ed ’em go. 

He was bulling with Greg Ran- 
dall, who drove the California 
Dream, when Ed Lamb’s name came 
up. 

“Never heard of him.” Stu Mc- 
Nair shrugged. 

“Private builder, no sponsor, no 
dough to speak of,” said Greg as he 
pulled tbou^tfuHy on his cigarette. 
“Got this thing he calls the 
Canadian Express, and it goes like 
a bat out of hell.” 

“Really? What’s he use for 
power?” They paused to watch a 
red Fenari Special accelerate across 



the salt, miles distant. The rasp of 
the engine reached them long after 
it had passed the second marker. 
Stu stretched his long angular arms 
overhead, accidentally brushing the 
tent fly, and recoiled. It sizzled 
from the relentless Utah sun. 

“An old Norton twin, I hear,” 
answered Greg. “Don’t know what 
he’s done to it, but they say it’ll 
rev something out of this world.” 
“What’re his times?” 

“Over three hundred, on local 
strips.” 

“Oh, come off it.” 

“No, that’s the story. And he’s 
been telling people he can do twice 
that out here. I tell you, Stu, get 
your oil in that guy’s engine, and 
you’ve got some real publicity. If 
it isn’t a fraud, that is.” 

L ater that day Stu found Ed Lamb 
crouched by the tailgate of his 
dusty pickup. He introduced himself 
and offered the mechanic a cigarette. 

“I’m from Castone. How about 
some oil for that monster?” 

“Nope. Thanks though.” 

“What’re you running now?” 

“Uh — Dunol,” answered Ed, lay- 
ing down a socket wrench and 
standing. “Whew, hot, eh?” He 
smiled calmly and wiped his sweat- 
ing forehead on a sleeve. Stu Mc- 
Nair immediately liked 'him. 

“Hear you bike goes real well.” 
“Not bad. I’ve had to modify 
the susx>ension a whole lot for the 
flats, though. Salt’s roughter’n it 
looks. Now I catji’t get the silly 
fairing back on.” 

“Let me give you a hand.” 

So they became friends. It was 



STAR BIKE 



75 




an easy sort of thing with no com- 
mercial overtones at all, unlike most 
of those at Bonnie. 

“So you won’t let me in on your 
secret,” Stu asked two nights later. 
“You’d better, y’know.” 

“How come?” 

“ ’Cause your performances are 
loo good not to be phony. In this 
business sponsors like, well, like my 
illustrious employers foot most of 
the bill, and t^y’re sore losers. Un- 
less you can give a better reason 
than witchcraft, they’ll usually trump 
up a disqualification.” 

“Haven’t won anything yet,” Ed 
reminded him. “But how’ll they nail 
me?” He slid off the tailgate and 
shoved his hands in his hip pockets. 
Rocking back on his heels he watch- 
ed the flawless desert sky ease 
toward black, twilight a mere line of 
gold on the horizon. 

Stu laughed quietly. “Don’t know 
how, but they’ll manage. And you’ve 
got the public to contend with too. 
People get mad. ‘What I don’t un- 
derstand doesn’t exist,’ that sort of 
thing. Must admit I’m a little 
peeved myself, pal. Just what in hell 
does make you go so fast?” 

“All right,” conceded the stocky 
Canadian after a pause. “It’d almost 
be a relief to have someone else 
know. Bring the hght.” He led the 
lanky engineer over to the recum- 
bent motorcycle. “S’right up your 
alley anyway, Stu. Oil.” Ed withdrew 
the dipstick from the Norton’s oil- 
tank. “Here, feel the end of this,” 
“Why, it’s — it’s absolutely 
weird.” In the glow of a gas lantern, 
Stu McNair stroked has finger down 
the greasy metal rod. His hand 



wasn’t even a blur. First it was mid- 
way, near a scribed oil level mark — 
then it was at the end. His arm 
tingled. 

F our hours later Stu wore a 
haggard look, and his eyes 
were red from too much micro- 
scope. He and Ed were in his room 
at the Landspeed Motel. Both were 
tired and a little high. A dozen beer 
cans filled the wastebasket. 

“Don’t understand,” Stu muttered 
to himself for the hundredth time. 

“Well, give up then,” Ed Lamb 
said, slouching a little deeper into 
his chair. “I did, long ago. Gift 
horse in’a mouts — mouth. Damn. 
Listen, pal, I’ve got to drive tomor- 
row. Coin’ back for some sleep.” 
He stood up. 

“Okay. Yeah, get enough sleep, 
you’ll need your reflexes. And Ed, 
keep the lid on it tomorrow.” 
Huh?” 

“I mean it. Seeing this weird yel- 
low stuff convinces me you can rev 
up past a hundred grand, but don’t 
do it. In the first place, you’ll never 
keep that bike on the ground, 
and — ” 

“Aw — ” 

“And in the second, people won’t 
beUeve it. Damn it all, this gunk 
isn’t even possible. And for heaven’s 
sake don't repeat that wild suspicion 
of yours about two outworiders and 
their spaceship. You’ll get laughed 
right into a nuthouse.” 

“Sure, sure. Get some sleep your- 
self, eb? G’night.” 

But the gangling engineer didn’t. 
He spent the night finishing off his 
eyes on the scope, his lungs on ciga- 



f6 



IF 




rettes and his disposition on a long- 
chain molecule whose shape was so 
ambivalent that he simply couldn’t 
sort k out. 

Around five in the morning, there 
was a sound from the only lighted 
window at Landspeed Motel. It was 
a It was a sigh of amazement 
that edged on horror. Then the ligh^ 
went out, and Stu McNair’s bleary 
eyes closed as the sun’s opened. 

Ill 

A t quarter of two in the afternoon, 
M Lamb climbed into his 
ieath^ and cinched up his helmet. 
He’d clocked about two-seventy that 
morning, more than fast enough to 
qualify. His gaze wandered from the 
vantage point of the warm-up pit 
across a hundred yards of salt to 
die starting line and then beyond. 
He always expected the^ noise to be 
deafening but it never was. In the 
woods it would have been, of course 
— ah, the woods, their brief image 
reminded Ed he hadn’t been home 
in a month — but not out here. 
Out here it was so wide open, so 
flat, so positively out of doors that 
the sou:^s got lost. Half a dozen 
savagely tuned engines must be run- 
ning now, on the move or on the 
siddines, but they were no more of- 
fensive than half a dozen crickets on 
a warm night. Except maybe that guy 
up on the line, starting his run. It 
was Greg Randall in the Dream. 

The California Dream was a jet- 
powered three-wheeler, technically a 
motorcycle, and it did make noise. 
A flag fell, and the four^on machine 
vanished down the flats like a 



dropped stone. Now there’s com- 
petition, Ed thought. No half- 
hearted efforts were going to beat 
that. 

“You’re next. Lamb. Good luck,” 
said an armibanded official as he 
passed by with a clipboard. A small 
crowd g^ered around Ed now. 

They were quieter than a usual 
starter’s crowd. For one thing there 
was no coterie of backers to cheer. 
A few words of encouragement and 
a couple of noncommittal pats on the 
back were Ed’s portion. He rolled the 
bike up to the line. 

Nobody knew him, really. Name 
Edward J. Lamb — Canadian — 
motorcycle — unlimited — fast 
qualifier. That’s all. Except that 
the poverty-stricken, ill-prepared ma- 
chine always seemed to go a hell of 
a lot faster than it should. 

Well, today we’ll see. A few sus- 
picious eyes probed under the fairing 
as Ed paused to kick the bike to 
hfe. Hadden rockets? No, just a huge 
gas tank and an etderty Ei^gUsh mo- 
torcycle engine. The Lead had ob*- 
viouky been modiflecL Huge intake 
tract for what must be a tremefidoiis 
rate of flow, they supposed. Bigger 
valves for the same reason, probably, 
and maybe a wild cam. But it wasn’t 
enough. 

Every critical eye said the same 
thing. Don’t know how or why it 
works, buddy, but it isn’t enough. 
Not enough to go as fast as all that. 
Not enough to beat me. You’ve 
got ito be cheating somehow, and I 
don’t like it. I don’t like it at all. 

E d sensed their hostility up on the 
line. Beneath him tiie bike vi-

brated quietly at idle. Quietly and 
innocently. And it sounded so inno- 
cent and seemed so small that he 
felt exposed and defenseless from 
all those cynical eyes. As the starter 
approached, the crowd backed off. 
Ed crouched low in the saddle and 
blipped the throttle. 

Across his handlebars lay a world- 
ful of salt. Red pennants marched 
into the distance like soldiers, two 
by two, marking a long, clean path 
which came to a point like distant 
railroad tracks. A mountain in the 
background, black. Above it the sky, 
white. 

“Ten seconds,” said the flagman 
who stood a few paces away. “On 
your mark.” The man stared intently 
at a stopwatch in his left hand and 
held a large flag upraised in his right. 
Ed eased the Norton’s engine up off 
idle and held it there. The sun soaked 
into 'his leathers. 

“Get set.” 

Back in the Castone booth Stu Mc- 
Nair stood on a wooden camp table, 
binoculars to eyes. The makeshift 
vantage point plus his own prodigious 
height gave him a good view of the 
start. The big man’s face was ashen. 

You’ll give it all, won’t you, he 
thought. Sure you will. Open her up. 
And that old engine’ll spin today, 
fantastically fast. Yeah, go on and 
blip it, warm it up. But Ed, old man, 
do you know what you’ve got there? 
A fast way to die. One way or an- 
other. To teU you the truth I hope 
you break your neck on the salt 
right now, I really do. At least it 
would save you from being chewed 
up by this crowd later. Who says 
they don’t still burn witches? 



on films that shift time indeed! 
Lubricants that induce relativistic, 
inertialess progression, ha! Mole- 
cules that weave and boil into the 
next second now? Nobody’s ready 
for that, my friend, not yet anyway. 
There’s the ten-second mark. On 
your mark, Ed. Get set. 

“Go!” The flag dropped. 

E d let out the clutch too fast 
Easy, no wheel spin, lunkhead, 
he thought. You’ll get there. He 
shifted twice, then once again. The 
engine chuffed out a string of blunt 
monsyllabic D’s: duh, duh, duh. 

And then P’s: papapapapa. Mark- 
ers dropped more quickly astern. 

And then T’s. They unwound be- 
hind Ed like tiny little knots on a 
long long string. The salt that had 
been so smooth at one hundred miles 
an hour became rougher at two. 

One long howling Z turned every 
head on the flats. The frequency 
was startlingiy high. Ed’s handlebars 
chattered and bucked in his white 
fists. An inch above his head boiled 
a torrent of air that just waited to rip 
it off. Some bullets didn’t go this 
fast. 

E wailed the engine: eeeeeeeee. 
Higher than any soprano could sing, 
higher than any violin. Seven fifty 
at least, Ed thought in the tiny frac- 
tion of his brain not completely 
blotted by sound. 

Four miles away Stu McNair 
agreed. At 'least seven fifty. I don’t 
know how he’s keeping it on the 
ground, but it doesn’t matter because 
the whole business is impossible. He 
put down his 'binoculars. Physically 
impossible.

I the Ralph-Vegan, looking 
up from his temporal monitor. 
“They can’t handle the implications 
of that lubricant. Time technology is 
indigestibly alien to them.” 

“All right,” answered the other. 
“I’ll branch us back to just after he 
repaired our tank, and we’ll patch 
things up.” 

CCXTO, ah, don’t take that. It’s

your bike, if that’s what you’re 
thinking. Wrong viscosity and every- 
thing.” 

“Hell, Dirk, I really don’t need 
any of this, and . .” 

“Here,” laughed the asitronaut. 
“The decision’s killing you. / know 
what you’d like, even if you won’t 
admit it. Adjustable-diameter pin 
spanner. Yeah, that one.” 



“Well, I’ve got to admit — 
thanks.” Ed grinned and dropped 
the beautiful tool in his pocket. 
“Thanks a lot. You’re a couple of 
real good — ” 

“Aw,” said Ralph, waving Ed 
quiet and blushing. “Let’s give you 
a hand With your tanks there.” 

“Swell. Say, are you guys leaving 
right away? I’d kinda like to see this 
crate take off.” 

“No, not too soon,” Ralph 
answered quickly. “After dark.” 

“Oh. Well, guess I’ll shove off 
then. S’long.” 

“Good luck.” 

As the big motorcycle crackled 
out of sight, the two fUers turned 
back to their machine. 

“That ought to do it. I think this’ll 
work out much better,” said Ralph. 

“We’ll see,” was the thoughtful 
reply. END 




IF • Short Story 



The 

Courteous of Ghoor 

by ROBERT LORY 

He was courteous^ thoughtful, 
affable — and totally dangerous! 



A rchie Pholpher was reflecting on 
the sad lot of thirty-five-year- 
old advertising account executives 
when the sensation in his inner ear 
began. 

Exactly one-sixteenth of a second 
later the tingle had increased in 
volume and pitch to a point where 
Archie became aware of it. When an 
eigjtith of a second had passed, Archie 
began to frown over his afternoon 
coffee. After another eighth of a 
second Archie screamed. 

At the scream’s beginning Archie 
Pholper had been sitting on a hard 
chair in the coffee room in the 
ground floor of the Madison Ave- 
nue building where he worked. When 
the scream ended — abruptly — he 
was still sitting on the same hard 
chair, but the sound of the scream 
and the sound in his ear which had 



caused the scream had been replaced 
by the pounding of surf. 

Archie and the chair were on a 
white-sandy beach. Odd, Archie 
thought. Not so much the beach, nor 
the sharp up-jutting rocks upon 
which the foamy water crashed about 
a hundred yards away. What was odd 
was the sky. It was bright orange. 

“Excellent! You managed to bring 
the chair with you.” 

The chair tipped quietly over in 
the sand as Archie jumped at the 
raspy voice. The man who had been 
standing behind Mm replaced the 
chair upright and looked evenly at 
Archie. “You must have been con- 
centrating on the chair,” he said, 
his voice sounding as if he were 
just recovering from a severe bout 
with laryngitis. 

“No, I wasn’t concentratiDg on 



80 




— ” Ardiie stopped, his thoughts 
suddenly focusing on his immediate 
surroundings and the strange man 
before him. Taller than Archie by 
two hands, he wore a white toga- 
like robe, in contrast to which his 
skin looked dark red, almost purple. 
He was old, too, in a well preserved, 
antique sort of way. At least eighty, 
Archie figured. 

“Almost three himdred of your 
years,” the old man supplied. “I am 
Tumal, Courteous of Ghoor.” He 
smiled, not unpleasantly, as he 
answered Archie’s unvoiced question. 

“Yes,” he went on, “I have the 
ability to read what you call your 
thou^ts. And although you hear 
the sound of my voice, my meaning 
is being translated for you tele- 
pathically. As for the thought now 
beginning to take shape within you, 
let me assure you that you are not 
dead but very much alive,” 

A rchie said uncertainly, “My idea 
of Hell would be something like 
this. Alone on a desolate beach, with 
nothing to break the continuing 
boredom. With maybe just a 
chair . .” 

“This is not the Hell of your 
mythology, Mr. Pholpher, though 
your idea of its content I find most 
interesting. This is in fact the sphere 
and domain of Ghoor, upon which 
I hold the office of Courteous.” 
“Another planet? I’m not on 
Earth?” Archie asked, disbelieving. 
Yet the orange sky made it hard to 
disbelieve. 

“On Ghoor, Earth is not very 
well known. Its very existence is 
known to few within the entire Wahr 



Federation. You are the first Earth- 
man — indeed the first Outsider — 
to penetrate the Impervious Veil for 
more than five ihundred of your 
years. And on your first try you 
brought a chair with youl” 

Archie looked at the chair and 
then at the orange sky. “But how? I 
mean, how did I bring the chair — 
and me — to here?” 

“Long ago in your civilization a 
man with your name said that if he 
had the place to stand he could 
move your entire planet with a lever. 
This is the principle you used — 
with my help. The lever in this in- 
stance is not what you might con- 
ceptualize as physic^, although the 
psychic and the physical are not as 
mutally exclusive as you suppose. 
Actually, it’s a simple matter of co- 
ordinating — ” 

Tumal’s raspy voice halted. He 
was looking skyward, listening in- 
tently. Above the sea’s horizon 
Archie saw a flash, a silvery re- 
flection. Tumal saw it, too. “You 
must go back now, quickly! Sit in 
the chair and concentrate!” 

Archie sat unsurely. “Concentrate 
... on what?” 

“Where you were, on Earth! 
Quickly — I’ll help.” 

Archie did as directed. Into his 
mind came the coffee room, his 
table,’ the copy of the Wall Street 
Journal he’d ^anced through when 
he’d first sat down, the cup of hot, 
welcome coffee after an early after- 
noon’s heated discussion with a dis- 
pleased client, the sugar he’d taken 
— two spoons’ full, even though 
he knew he should be counting cal- 
ories and shouldn’t have — 



THE COURTEOUS Of GHOOR 



81 




And then the spoon and the sugar 
took on unnatural lines — or natural, 
perhaps. The white sugar was coming 
apart, ibreaking into blues and reds 
and yellows which in turn were 
separating into greens and ormg^ 
and purples, all in forms of grains or 
spots or lines. Lines. That’s what 
they were, really, the sugar was 
really nothing more . and all were 
converging and — 

There was a sound, a tingle in 
Archie’s inner ear. It was getting 
higher higher and louder and — 
a screani formed in Archie’s mouth. 
It came out as he crashed onto the 
tile floor of the coffee room. 

“Sir, is something wrong?” 

Archie’s eyes opened and peered 
into the anxious face of the waitress 
standing by the side of his table. He 
looked doW as ihis hand felt the 
area of the floor around his aching 
buttocks. 

“I forgot,” he said simply. “I for- 
got to bring the blasted chair back 
with me.” 

44Xrou’ve done very well, Archi- 
X medes,” Tumal said with 
admiration. “I didn’t think your first 
solo flight would come off half so 
well.” 

Archie kicked a pile of white sand 
into the air. “I did it, sure. But I 
don’t understand it. I don’t even 
know for sure what a coordinate is. 
And I don’t much care for the 
Archimedes name, even though I was 
bom with it.” 

“Very well, Archie,” Turnal rasp- 
ed. “As for knowing what co- 
ordinates are in essence, it’s not real- 
ly necessary that you do understand 



it all. The important thing is that 
you can see them, concentrate upon 
them and utilize them to move 
things. After all, you don’t have to 
know the electronics of your Earth 
television in order to swit^ on a re- 
ceiver.” 

True, Archie reflected. And it was 
also true that he could see and use 
the multicolored shapes that Tumal 
called coordinates. He’d proved that 
during the past four days, during 
which Turnal had assist^ him in 
moving to and from the sandy beach 
on Ghoor one desk from his apart- 
ment, a Pontiac from a used car 
lot, the arch at Washington Square 
and even a group of humans — a 
psychedelic seminar of Villagers, who 
upon return reported the wildest LSD 
trip ever taken. 

He’d been imeasy about soloing, 
but things had gone well. He could 
now control the tingling sensation 
in his ears, so the pain element of 
“shifting” — Turnal’s name for the 
moving process — was gone. He’d 
visualized (or mentalized or what- 
ever) the on-Ghoor coordinates so 
many times with Turnal’s help that 
they came easy, even when concen- 
trating on the large solo target he’d 
chosen. 

He had supvposed that moving the 
400,000 square foot New York Pub- 
lic Library, even at night when oply 
the guards were inside, would be 
difficult. It wasn’t, although the shift 
back had to be made twice. The 
first time the northeast comer of 
the building was misplaced, extending 
slightly onto Forty-Second Street 
and almost causing an early-morning 
traffic accident. Luckily, the driver

IF 




and the eleven other people who wit- 
nessed the happening were natives 
of the city. Since the event had 
nothing to do with them personally 
they did not attempt to investigate 
further. 

Archie could do it, all right. That 
wasn’t what was bothering him. 
Something else was. 

“You want to know why,” Tumal 
said matter-of-factly. 

Archie nodded. “I suppose that’s 
it. I mean, it’s been a lot of fun 
and all, the most fun I’ve had in 
years, but — ” 

“Enveloping your skill, Mr. 
Pholper,” Turnal said sternly, “is not 
a matter of recreation for me nor 
for you. The purpose behind your 
training is deadly serious. You were 
chosen among aU Earthlings to do 
an all-important job. And now you 
are ready.” 

“What . job? Archie asked 
warily. 

T he Courteous of Ghoor spoke 
less sternly. “You remember 
how your namesake — the Greek, I 
believe he was — framed his impor- 
tant concept? He said that if he had 
the proper leverage he could move 
your entire planet. That is precisely 
the job you must do.” 

“The planet? EarthV Archie was 
astounded. “But why? And how? And 
why me?” 

“The how is simple. You can do 
it, just as you shifted the place of 
many books. A little more effort, 
perhaps, may be needed, but you 
have the tools. As for the why — 
the reason is to save your planet. 
It must be moved from your solar 



system, and soon. Your sun is 
about to 'blow. A nova, in your un- 
derstanding, is what will r^ult. 
While one star more or less explod- 
ing in the univeise is an unimportant 
event in the scheme of things, to you 
and your fellow Earth people it is 
of the utmost seriousness.” 

Archie agreed, his noouth wide 
open. 

“The only solution is to move 
Earth out of your system. We’ve 
chosen coordinates around a sun 
similiar to yours within our Feder- 
ated Systems. You’11 have to learn 
the coordinates prior to ^ shift.” 

“But — ” Archie beg^ still not 
fully comprehending. ‘To move the 
whole world. Won’t that shake every- 
body up some?” 

“Of course. Psychdogically,” 
Tumal said. “But the shake-up won’t 
compare with the one they’ll get 
when your sun explodes. It is, after 
all, for their own good you’re do- 
ing this.” 

Archie thought for a moment. 
“But why me? You or one of your 
people could do it — or couldn’t 
you?” 

“Yes, we — ” Tumal’s eyes shot 
skyward. “Quick! To the rocks,” he 
rasped. **Runr 

Tpoilowing Tumal, who seemed 
A spry for a man his age, Archie 
had just about reached the up-jutting 
rocks on the beach when he spotted 
the reason for their running. A silver- 
blue glint in the sky flashed high 
over the calm sea. A space vehicle 
of some kind. It appeared to be get- 
ting larger, therefore nearer. 

“Wahr patrol ship,” Tumal puffed 



THE COURTEOUS OF GHOR 



83 




wlien they had gained the shadowy 
concealment of a horizontal rough 
outcrop of the rock. “They mustn’t 
spot you, or they’ll know later that 
Ghoor helped move you.” 

“You mean you shouldn’t be help- 
ing?” Archie asked. 

“Absolutely not,” Tumal whisper- 
ed. “You asked if I or my people 
could move your planet into its new 
coordinates. Yes, I could, as could 
many on Ghoor. We could do it in 
the ability sense, but not in a moral 
sense. The Wahr Federation of 
Spheres would consider such an act 
by us as illegal.” 

A humming sound had grown 
whfle Tumal had been speaking. 
Now the old man put one fingw tp 
his lips, while pointing upward with 
his other hand. The patrot ship must 
be directly over their place of con- 
cealment, Archie concluded. 

Moments later the humming sound 
had been reduced to silence. As 
Tumal led Archie from the rocks he 
explained, “They’ve sensed your 
breaking through the Impervious 
Veil, put there centuries ago to keep 
out space explorers from other sys- 
tems. Luckily, they haven’t yet b^n 
able to localize you. But we must 
act swiftly.” 

Something was still bothering 
Archie, he didn’t know precisely 
what. “You say that your moving 
us would be immoral. But surely it 
can’t be immoral for your people to 
tiy and save ours.” 

“Morals and the law and their re- 
lationships are inve^ved subjects, 
their intrioaoies not always similar 
among different peoples. What’s im- 
portant is that we cannot move you. 



Within the Federation, illegalities are 
punished severely.” 

“You would be punished?” 

“Not just me,” Tumal said in a 
fatherly tone. “I am by appoint- 
ment Courteous of all Ghoor. I act 
in my dealings with you not as an 
individual but in my official capacity 
by direction of our Council. All 
Ghoor would be punished.” 

“What about Earth, then?” Archie 
asked. “Will my people be punished 
for breaking Federation law? If we 
enter the Veil — ” 

Tumal grinned, his teeth sparkling 
in the sunlight. “Ah, but you are not 
members of the Federation, and thus 
not subject to its law. But time 
moves swiftly. I must give you your 
new coordinates.” 

A rchie drummed nervous fingers 
on the top of his desk. 

It was mid-morning, a Tuesday, 
the day, and approaching the time 
Tumal had given him for the shift. 
There was a problem, however. 
Archie was getting cold feet 

The whole world. Plus the atmos- 
phere, of course. If only he could 
leave the smog behind, he thought, 
almost jokingly. But it was no time 
to joke. The whole world. 

Could he do it? Sure, he had the 
coordinates and the skill. Tumal 
had said he’d been chosen specifical- 
ly among Earthmen because of his 
peculiar mix of imagination, stick-to- 
itiveness and confidence in himself. 
But .... 

Earth weighed so much. To lift 
all that, think of it! But he couldn’t 
have lifted the New York Public 
Library either. That had gone 



84 



IF 




smoothly enough. And Tumal was 
so confident. But suppose something 
went wrong. Sure, tie had the co- 
ordinates, but .... 

Suppose one of those was just a 
little off? 

Archie stopped drumming. Just a 
little off, he thought — like when 
be returned the library the first time. 
Coordinates were just colors to him, 
but colors have shades. A slight er- 
ror in visualization — if that, again, 
was the right word — and the 
whole world. 

No, he couldn’t do it. Not with- 
out making sure first. 

But how to do that? He couldn’t 
go himself in advance and check up 
on it If there was just space out 
there he’d have no place to stand 
while checking. He couldn’t even 
breathe. And he certainly couldn’t 
get a space capsule for the purpose. 
They don’t give those things to ad- 
vertising people who might like a 
morning jaunt in space. 

No, he couldn’t go, not physical- 

ly- 

But mentally? 

If — 

He’d moved a building. He had 
not had to move the entire founda- 
tion and landscape with it. He’d 
moved a desk and a chair. It hadn’t 
mattered that they were in buildings 
at the time. His mind — or his 
viewer-something, the thing that was 
part of his mind that framed the 
coordinates — if he could concen- 
trate on shifting just that and not the 
rest of him .... 

The whole world! 

He folded his hands in his lap 
and inhaled slowly. His pulse pound- 



ed in his head, refusing to be quieted. 
Colors blended, changed, elongated, 
separated and crystallized until — 
They were right. Now — 

No, too much. Not all this, but — 
That? 

No. No! Tbere, right there — 
THAT! 

Archie saw. Not with eyes, but 
with ... he didn’t know what. His 
eyes never could have pierced the 
distances from the landing coordi- 
nates this his “sight” took him. But 
he saw nonetheless and, seeing, 
switched back to the coordinates of 
his office. He felt, rather than saw, 
his hands trembling when he opened 
his eyes. 

The ships! God, there must have 
been a thousand dark red space ships 
surrounding the coordinates where 
Earth was due to be shifted. 

The Federation had found out. 
Archie had to reach Tumal. - 

T hey were waiting for him on the 
beach under Che orange sky. 
Twenty to thirty men of clear green 
skin dressed in brilliant blue uni- 
forms. They were human types, 
physically strong, Archie concluded 
from the grips of the two who held 
him. 

“Stay, Outsider!” an authoritative 
voice commanded. “Do not shift 
back. You will not be harmed.” 

The two men holding Archie im- 
mediately released him, and he turn- 
ed to face a young man whose uni- 
form style separated him above the 
others. “You are to be congratulated 
on your mastery of movement,” the 
leader said. “I am Sparik, Comman- 
der Fourth Class in the Wahr Feder- 



THE COURTEOUS OF GHOR 



85 




ation Arm of Enforcement. There 
are thing s I must know from you.” 
Archie’s face reddened. “Here’s 
your first bit of knowledge. Your 
ships will have a long wait. I’m 
wise to your sitake-out. I’m not about 
to bring my planet inside your pre- 
cious Veil so you can burn it to a 
crisp with your weapons. We’ll take 
our chances with our sun!” 

The muscles of Spaiik’s face ti^t- 
enecL “You were going to bring 
your planet inside Federation terri- 
tory? At the suggestion of the 
Courteous of Ghoor, I suppose.” 
Archie said nothing. They had 
promised not to harm him, but Tur- 
nal was another matter. 

“We know Turnal has been meet- 
ing an Outsider on this beach. Now 
we know who, and I’ve a good idea 
as to why. Let me ask you this. You 
say you saw ships near the place you 
were to move your planet to. How 
you were able to see these is beyond 
my comprehension, but were those 
ships red in color?” 

“You l^now they were!” 

Sparik nodded. “Correction: I 

thought they were. Outsider, I would 
inform you that all official Federa- 
tion ships are blue. Of the twelve 
planets within our System, only one 
identifies its military ships with red. 
That f^anet is Ghoor.” 

Archie’s mouth shot open. “That’s 
— impossible!” 

“Only too possible. I’m afraid,” 
Sparik said. “Ghoor has a history 
of warfare. The Federation, a thou- 
sand years and more ago, was first 
formed as a league of protection 
against the planet on which you 
now stand. Ghoor was defeated and 



its people accepted the ultimatum 
that they would confine their war- 
like activity to their own planet or — 
if attacked — to those outside the 
System. Some five hundred years 
ago, Ghoor discovered a legal tech- 
nicality. They shifted a planet from 
outside the Veil to a point inside 
their own field of domain. They then 
destroyed it as a trespasser in an 
orgy ot flame,” 

“That’s what they were going to 
do — to us?” Archie asked quietly. 

“Precisely.” 

A rchie sputtered, “But why — 
why have me do it? Why didn’t 
they — ” 

“Ihey were forbidden to shift any 
other planet inside the Veil. How- 
ever, they obviously discovered an- 
other technicality. If you, a member 
of the outside planet, did the shift- 
ing .. .” 

“But couldn’t you — the Federa- 
tion — protect us?” 

“You are not members of the 
Federation,” Sparik said. 

“That was the reason Turnal gave 
me for an Earthman making the 
shift,” Archie said. “As non-mem- 
bers, he said, we would not be sub- 
ject to its laws.” 

“Nor its protection,” Sparik added 
soberly. “We shall, however, amend 
the laws to prohibit in the future 
what you’ve experienced. You may 
return to your home now.” 

Archie’s face paled. “My home — 
Earth. Turnal said our sun — ” 
Sparik smiled. “Whatever Turnal 
said may safely be discounted. His 
office in the Ghoor Council should 
have indicated that.” 



86 



IF 




“You mean his office as Court- 
eous?” 

“Of course. A Courteous is what 
you might call the . afficM liar 
of (the council. Of Federation 
spheres, only Ghoor has one.” 

“I wish — ” Archie said — “I 
wish (there were some way I could 
get even.” 

Sparik smiled again. “Yes. The 
Federation would be 'better without 
Ghoor. I, too, wish you might find 
the way. 

The way. Archie thought about 
that moments later as he sat in his 
Madison Avenue office. Sparik’s 
choice of words had been strange. 
He did not say he wished Archie 
would find a way. He said the way. 



Which meant that Sparik knew of a 
way and hoped that Archie would 
find it. 

But wihiy couldn’t Sparik simply 
have told — 

Of course. Sparik was of the 
Federation. He could not suggest the 
way. But Archie was not su(b}ect to 
Federation law. He could do — 
what? 

And then Archie knew. 

He laughed out loud at the sim- 
plicity of the method. Then he fold- 
ed his hands and dosed his eyes. 

Concentrating on the two sets of 
coordinates, he shifted the entire 
planet Ghoor to the place where 
the big guns of the dark red ships 
waited. END

by LAURENCE YEP 



L ight stirs on the waters; gold rib- 
bons cross the wrinkled water’s 
back. In the- dim awakening of the 
sun, the silhouetted V of a bird cra- 
a-cks the sky with a call. The ocean 
foams as their lips suck the rim of 
the beach. Sand grips my back like 
a myriad of stars moving down my 
spine. The sun comes up on tiptoe 
beneath the sun-bumt clouds and 
wine-stained sky. For us. Light 



catches upon her hair and sweeps 
down the myriad clouds of fiery tips. 
Green eyes flaked with gold rim the 
universe and content rests leisurely 
in the quiet curve of her lips. I am 
satisfied. 

Lecher, she flashed at me. 

“What?” I said, tightening my arm 
about Pryn’s waist. 

You heard me, she frowned. 
Your lust would get an elephant in 
heat. 

I laughed because that’s the only 



thing to do when a telepath catches 
you. “You could tell me to take my 
arm away from you,” I said. 

She smiled and eased her shoul- 
der even tighter against my side. 
/ like it, and even if I didn*t„ you 
are much too strong to argue with, 
I like you even if you are an Eng- 
lish major. 

I grunted and kissed her. “You 
be the brains, and I’ll be the mus- 
cle.** With my free hand, I felt the 
little gold ring and wondered how 
to propose. Meanwhile the girl, who 
had earned a Ph.D. in marine biol- 
ogy when she was twenty-two, lean- 
ed her head against my shoulder 
with a comfortable little sigh. 

For a man with a bachelor’s 
in English I suppose I should have 
come back with some witty repar- 
tee; but sitting on the beach with 
the invalided sun slowly limping in- 
to the sky and a girl fitted nicely 
into your arms, you don’t want 
words. 

“Shut up,” I said. I felt Pryn’s 
arm holding me closer, and we hud- 
dled together, watching the blond- 
maned sun trail its colored cloak 
across the waters. 

A s we walked down the stairs to 
the laj>, I held her hand, lis- 
tening to the Kids splashing happily 
in their tank. I’ve never quite gotten 
over the thrill of the contact. Not 
that I haven’t held hands with other 
girls. Pryn needs the physical con- 
tact to permit exact communication 
and in the meantime, all the gentle 
warmdi that’s in her sits quietly in 
your soul until her words flash like 
liquid fire spiraling down my spine. 



AN IF FIRST 

In each issue, IF publishes at least one 
''First^' story by someone who has never 
had a story published professionally be- 
fore. This month's "First" author is 
Laurence Yep, a young San Franciscan 
who is a graduate of St. Mary's Chinese 
School and St. Ignatius High School and 
is now a sophomore at Marquette Uni- 
versity. A National Merit Finalist and 
winner of the Bausch & Lomb Science 
Award and the Bank of America Cer- 
tificate in Classics, 19-year-old Laurence 
Yep is clearly headed for great thingsl 



“What’re we going to do today?” 
I asked Pryn. 

She stopped me on the stairs. I 
cart see why you're named Deuca- 
lien. 

I squeezed her hand. “The name’s 
Duke.” And in the staccato bursts 
of fire that signifies laughter I ask- 
ed, “All right, why?” 

Because you're always so curious, 
like Prometheus, your ancestor. She 
patted my head. But thinking should 
be left to the people with Ph.D's. 

I grabbed her by her slim waist 
and lifted her up with her legs giv- 
ing little kicking protests. “Some 
day you’re going to be Mrs. Duke 
Selchey, and then what are you go- 
ing to do?” 

Educate you, ditch-digger. 

I put her down, and she slipped an 
arm through mine. And get your 
name changed legally. 

As we stepped into tho room with 
technicians running about their 
tasks, the oscilloscope wrinkled its 
green face at us as the speaker 
rasped.

IF 





“Brood-love, male, female, state- 
ment” 

That’s the Kids* way of saying 
hello. Ollie and Ossie, the Kids’ 
Christian names, have about ten 
words that they can say, and com- 
binations of these widen their vo- 
cabnlary. “Brood-love” best trans- 
lates that ambiguous bond of mutu- 
al danger, feeding, birth,- death and 
procreation that exists between us. 
It’s pretty ambiguous but they 
wouldn’t even know that much if it 
weren’t for Pryn and her telepathy. 

“Kids, get up here, will you?” 
Noe called out from the walkway 
over the tank. I looked at the tall 
man, fighting a losing battle with 
his hairline. The pouch like a preg- 
nant guppy, peeping over the belt 
of his shorts. The hair on his legs 
is thin, starved on the fatty tissues 
there. His thick glasses keep sliding 
down his nose like a two-legged mis- 
chievous insect. But he’s the father 
of our small family and the patri^ 
arch of all the newcomers to the 
Institute. Noe’s a good man, if you 
don’t take him too seriously, E.g., 
Noe insists that Pryn and I are the 
Kids even though the rest of the In- 
stitute gives that name to Ollie and 
Ossie. But Noe being the patriarch 
of the institute, proxy father, we ac- 
cept his white man’s burden. After 
all, we of the Institute are all Sel- 
chey’s kids. 

Noe’s father, after a fashion. He 
and my father were alike physically. 
That’s what Noe remembers, and I 
suppose he’s right. My own memory 
of John Gunnar is colored by time 
and several hundred feet of water. 
He remains a hearty laugh, bursting 



from the obscure, glaring heights 
with a pair of thick glasses shining 
like twin moons. I guess Noe treats 
me the way my father would; ex- 
pressing unscientific affection awk- 
wardly in scientific terms. 

“Where were you Kids?” Noe 
asked. 

“For a swim. Uncle Noe,” smiled 
Pryn. 

“Good, because I want to tell the 
dolphins that we’re going out *to the 
deep sea today,” Noe said. Pryn 
slipped off her sandals and took off 
her lab coat, looking trim and deli- 
cate in her bathing suit. I followed 
with more dignity — Pryn claims 
it’s just clumsiness. 

I squinted in the water for the 
Kids. Someone shoved hard 
from behind, and I tumbled about in 
the water, waving my anm Kke 
some ungainly bird to regain my 
balance. I waved my fist at Ossie, 
the male of the Kids, who only gave 
that chittering cry that might be a 
laugh or a cluck of sympathy. I 
can’t tell which with that eternal 
smile hung on his face: 

Pryn swam up beside Ossie, plac- 
ing a hand upon his head to give 
Noe’s orders. I watched Pryn and 
admired her slim curves outlined by 
the light from the window in the 
front of the tank. Ollie nudged me 
from the side and I stroked her side 
affectionately. You get to adopt a 
paternal attitude toward the Kids 
after a while. 

When Pryn had finished, she gave 
one last pat to Ossie and nodded to- 
ward me. With a last stroke I swam 
to Pryn’s side, and we surfaced to

face Noe, who was squatting on the 
walk over the tanlr, 

“Get into your suits. Kids. I 
want to have as much daylight as 
possible,” Noe said. 

I trembled slightly in the locker 
room as the wet suit clung to my 
body like a flailed ray fish. I hate 
the idea of going into the water 
where I can’t see the floor beneath, 
and going back to the City, the pro- 
genitrix of an my phobias, doesn’t 
help them any. 

I remember that day that slashed 
my life and left me dangling by the 
threads. I was just thirteen when 
California slipped from the conti- 
nenfs side to repopulate itself with 
fishes. I know that we were having 
a big campaign about how we were 
number one in population, and may- 
be some fertility god was slighted at 
the lack of cr^t I couldn’t really 
tcB you. All I know is that every- 
thing was knocked off the shelf 
like brittle china when the Flood hit.

I was in a school that lay at the 
feet of one of these steep hills 
that pimple the City — to be more 
precise, I was in tiie play court of 
our school running an errand for 
the teacher. The ground under me 
wobbled, and my eyes felt ready to 
crawl from my head as if I, and not 
the ground, were in a seizure. I laid 
my body next to tiie ground, feeling 
the deep throbs of its heart, and 
clung to the earth that was deter- 
mined to shake me off its back. 

A thin, black weed spread hair- 
thin roots on the back of the school 
92 



building. The roots expanded, and 
parts of the wall fell, exposing the 
school’s trembling internals. I cov- 
ered my head and huddled into a 
small ball, hoping that whoever the 
destroyer was he would miss me. 

Glass tinkled on the pavement as 
the beU shorted and began ringing 
wildly. Concrete thudded as some- 
one screamed. Then the voice be- 
came the joined shrillings of chil- 
dren that the falling building quick- 
ly out-shouted. Then, except for the 
bell, there was quiet from the re- 
mains of the building. 

I coughed in the thick dust that 
powdered the sun and wondered at 
the silence. A mountain of rubble 
quivered where the school had stood. 
Here and there, tall fingers of crook- 
ed steel gestured wamingly. I crawl- 
ed toward the pile of my school, 
splashing through a puddle that 
slowly extended arms from the lava- 
tory. I sat on a large section of 
concrete, one hand touching the 
door of the lavatory that was still 
above the rubble. 

I was alone in the tawdry slate- 
gray sky with the dust of the fallen 
masonry in my nose, smoke irri- 
tating my eyes from the fires in the 
neighboring buildings. 

People shouted in the streets, 
some for help, others for a certain 
person, always with a lost-dog ap- 
peal. Then in the sudden second of 
guillotined time, the screaming re- 
verted to one word: tidal wave. The 
shaking of the ground grew strong- 
er as Neptune reared fear. 

I clung to the door that lay against 
the rubble as I saw the glass 

IF 




wall of the wave towering over me, 
its green crystal face etched with 
lines and grooves like the bole of a 
tree. And frozen in that face were 
chairs and a tree limb and one man’s 
hand held vaguely out in greeting to 
someone. 

I screwed my eyes tight into my 
face and buried my head into the 
door as the wave swept its skirts 
over me. The weight of ages pressed 
me into the board, and I knew how 
Jesus and St. Christopher and all the 
scapegoats felt. I held my breath 
as the ocean surrounded me, feeling 
the stale air inside me kicking its 
way out and seeing small bubbles 
escape from my mouth like excla- 
mations. I was isolated in a dim, 
dirty world in which I couldn’t 
breathe, catching vague glimpses of 
stilled forms being twirled like trin- 
kets by the water and the ghostly 
mouths of the Tiouses open in silent 
cries. 

Suddenly my head and body burst 
into the open air, and I gasped for 
breath, letting my head rise a little. 
Small waves came sweeping in, 
gently toying with my door. 1 press- 
ed my head against the door until 
it bumped and poked at the belly 
of the hilL 

Someone tried to pull me off 
my door, but I dung on tightty, so 
that they dragged me, door and all, 
onto the hill. I let go then. 1 still 
don’t know who carried me up the 
hill. I was laid down on the top of 
the hill, coughing and sobbing as 
my lungs tried to readjust to breath- 
ing air. I was in a little green park, 
lying in the grass with the sun like 
a cheap bulb glaring in the sky. 
THE SELCHEY KIDS 



People around me formed wet- 
sullen mobs about the two houses 
still standing on the hill top. An 
owner of one house opened his door 
and took in as many people as he 
could, but a fight broke out when he 
tried to turn the rest away. The fire 
and blood pounded in the mob. 
When the madness finally left, both 
houses were burning and everyone 
who could still stand was looking 
sadly at the flames. 

I kept away from the mob, 
walking to the opposite end of the 
hill which was now an island. 1 
huddled on the spot, looking out to- 
ward where our house should be, un- 
der the water, wondering why I was 
the only one left in an ugly, con- 
fusing world and wishing I wasn’t. 
Family, friends and even identity 
were lost in barely half an hour. I 
decided then that I wouldn’t worry 
about friends or attachments or oth- 
er natural things that could be so 
easily broken. 

I went to an aunt in the Midwest 
where they don’t have hills, or the 
ocean — just little lakes doing imi- 
tations, no surf at night, no seagulls 
shrieking or foghorns belching and 
no fog — just an insipid cloud layer. 
I hated every moment of it 

1 grew up among the com and 
\iriieat fields like a strong weed. Aunt 
Ofia tried but a weekend movie and 
aj^e pies aren’t really that stimulat- 
ing. Hot meals are nice, but man does 
not live by bread alone.

my BA. in English along the way.

dozen rq'ection slips 1 let that slide

away from me the way the City and 
my parents had. 

Finally I decided to go back to- 
ward the Ocean and home. Some- 
times I hitchhiked and where I did 
not pick up a ride, I worked until 
I had enough to go on. Sometimes 
I even walked; but by hook or by 
crook I travel^ toward home, Cal- 
ifornia or bust, until I reached New 
Milpitas, land’s end. 

T here’s not much left of the state 
now. The Sierras still left part 
of themselves hanging like a scar on 
the western side of the states, and 
there’s a series of islands left from 
the City which did not collapse like 
the rest of the state. But few of 
them are occupied. So New MUpitas 
supplies the few people that are left 
in the state, and New Milpitas was 
where I stopped. 

What few fishing boats there were 
weren’t interested in going out to 
the “Deep Ocean” that was the City. 
And nothing, not even a Phi Beta 
Kappa key, kids, will charter a boat 
out in New Milpitas. You need the 
root of all evil to grease the wheels 
that make the world spin its topsy- 
turvy way. 

All day I would sit on the splin- 
tered wharf and ask, “What was I?” 
Then answer: by my nature I am 1) 
a substance, 2) living, 3) sentiment, 
4) rational and I belong to the spe- 
cies of Man. I know that much, 
thanks to old Perphyry, but what 
else am I? Not even a binary num- 
ber on a magnetic bit because all 
the computers that held my old life 
are full fathom five. Once I thought 
I could be a teacher or a writer, but 



these were winter skins that could 
never hold on my slick, wet non-past. 
1 have no identity, only tiie inheri- 
tance of my humanity. 

I was sitting on the \riiarf one 
day, watching the sun wash the cold 
off the water’s shoulders and letting 
these words worm inside my mind in 
an endless tape. A girl arching twin 
quills of water behind her, waving 
like an albino peacock, swam before 
me. Her head dotted the golden 
scales rippling on the belly of the 
sea, and her white arms flashed as 
she swam. 

Bitterness held the tear ducts of 
my eyes and twisted until I almost 
cried. Suicide seemed the best thing, 
and I looked to a peak on an island 
across from me. I would look down 
at the tinted pane of glass with the 
boats like snails and worms streak- 
ing little trails of slime behind them. 
From those Olympian heights, with 
arms crossed, I would dedicate my 
death to the frigidity of the world 
order and the fragility of existence 
and then leap gracefully off my is- 
land. 

I debated whether dawn or dusk 
would be more appropriate symbol- 
ically when a hand touched my arm. 
Golden warmth sheathed my soul 
and content, that was almost near; 
but I fought the alien touch, wel- 
comed the warmth and no more, 
preserving my remaining identity. 

/ could feel your emotions even 
from where I was, I heard my mind 
say. 

I turned to see the girl, kneeling 
beside me, green eyes seardiing my 
face, drops of water strealdng down 
like tears.

IF 




“What?” I asked, wrinkling my 
forehead in surprise. 

Death is waste, death is the end 
of change and change is the purpose 
of man. She p/aused, then, Ifs not 
natural, 

“Go join the Salvation Army,” I 
said. Her nails bit into my arm, 
making slender crescents of blood. 
Angry fire burst through every nerve 
in my body and died down. 

Vm sorry, the words came. She re- 
leased my arm and placed her hand 
in her lap. 

I picked up her hand and turned 
it over to examine the palm and 
fingers. She tried to pull away but 
I gripped her wrist tightly. 

“Why did you come?” I asked 
angrily. “Why?” 

We stared at each other, listen- 
ing to the waters suck at the con- 
crete legs of the wharf. I found my- 
self resting on her green eyes, float- 
ing gently on the golden flakes. She 
shrugged and took my hand. 

You felt so sad, she said. / had 
to come, 

“And do you know why?” I asked 
with a half-smile. 

She looked at me and nodded, 
which annoyed me. If anyone should 
know my problems, it should be me. 

“Then tell me,” I said. She shook 
her head, droplets gently falling. 

Thafs for you to find out, 

I looked out toward where the City 
should lay, watching a tubby 
fishing boat chug out into the deep, 
and I knew .

the rocks while father stood encased 
in the solid crystal water with his

big boots like an old skin still Ring- 
ing, red in hand, contented; and 
mother’s face turned toward the sun 
with her green sunglasses like in- 
sect eyes outstaring her admirers; 
and me inside my sand forts and 
castles. 

“What’s that?” I asked, pointing 
at a clear shape with wet strings of 
flesh dangling from it. Fascinated 
by its foreign beauty, yet afraid of 
its death, I shuffled toward it tim- 
idly. 

“A squid, dear,” my mother said; 
and trembling, I kicked sand over it 
to hide it from my sight, and laugh- 
ter fell from her white throat like 
spring blossoms: White, pure, and 
gentle, as a memory should be. 

You were from the city. Why 
don't you stay with us for a while. 
Her hand covered the memories for 
now like the tide and the buried 
heap. 

“You’re from the city too?” I 
asked. Few survived that June 
morning, and even fewer mention it. 
Some experiences like the Flood be- 
come more vivid than life, a histori- 
cal fact that dominates your life un- 
forgettably forever. Talking only 
strengthens the holds that the mem- 
ory has on you. 

/ and Uncle Noe belonged to the 
Marine Institute, We were on an 
expedition along the coast in our 
ship when the Flood came, 

“Did you know a Dr. Gunnar 
and his wife?” I demanded. 

Yes, she exclaimed. Dr. Gunnar’s 
the big man that looks like Uncle 
Noe. And Mrs. Gunnar — I used 
to think she was the most beautiful 
woman in the world. 



95 




The pleasure was a fireball burst- 
ing in me, comforting my mind in 
the soothing magma. Coincidences 
are funny, but they’re good to have. 

‘‘They were my parents,” I said. 

Then yoiCre Duke, she said with 
a smile. Do you remember Pryn? 

.1 remembered the tall seventeen- 
year-old with legs tanned so that 
she looked like she stepped from a 
copper penny. Even despite the dis- 
taste I felt for girls before the Flood 
I had to admire her swimming. 

“Yes,” I said and smiled for the 
first time. 

She took my hand and pulled me 
up. “You can’t very well refuse my 
invitation now. We must be the only 
family that you have.” 

I looked out at the world with my 
ready-made identity. “Let’s go.” 

And that was how the Prodigal re- 
turned to the Marine Institute and 
met Noe Sclchey, father figure, last 
surviving director and thus the ma- 
nipulator of vast reserves stored 
away in Eastern banks, and heart- 
ache to the insurance companies. 

We called our island Parnassus 
because in the predUuvian days that 
was the name of the street at the 
top of the hill. When the bulldozers 
buried the street sign and threw up 
a tower of steel and glass that smiled 
like a surgeon’s needle, we kept the 
name. 

I came back to my home to work 
and forget; but of course there was 
no forgetting so close to home. The 
happiness that was my mother and 
father drowned, the screams of my 
friends being crushed moved dream- 
ily in the giant, silent world of the 
ocean like memories. But if the ache 
96 



of remembering jemained, some- 
thing else balanced the other side 
of living, and she was Pryn. 

in 

W hen he had rolled the Kids 
out to the pier and left them 
to the technicians to lower into the 
ocean beside the Institute’s boat, I 
led her out to the end of the dock. 
She sat down on one of the pilings, 
idly drawing designs on the wharf 
with her finger which she had dip- 
ped in a nearby puddle. I took her 
hand and felt gold tire like tine 
thread weaving a cocoon inside my 
body. 

I licked my lips. “Pryn, I know 
that you’re several years older than 
me — ” 

Four years. Her hand tensed in 
mine. I think I know what you 
want to ask and the answer is no, 
“At least think about it tonight,” 
I said. 

You* re a dear sweet boy — 
“Boy!” I spluttered. 

Yes, you* re a boy in many ways, 
and I love you for them. She touch- 
ed my cheek with soft finger tips. 
/ love you even more than / love 
Uncle Noe; but for several reasons 
— including biological — / can 
never marry you. 

“I hate to be crude, but — ” 
Then we*U stop right here and be 
good . friends. She smiled and 
kissed me, then walked swiftly away 
toward the ship, sandals slapping the 
pier and my mind. 

As I climbed to the bridge of our 
boat, Noe turned toward me. He 
adjusted his glasses which had slip- 

IF 




ped down his nose once more. 

“Duke, I wish I’d been able to 
rear you with Pryn.” 

I shrugged as I sat down in a 
diair. “You couldn’t know that 
there would be other survivors.” 
Noe nodded to one of the work- 
ers who tossed off the mooring 
ropes. He gunned the motor, and the 
ship shook itself, trembled in the 
cold waters, mumbling sleepily. 
Then the ship rumbled “John Hen- 
ry” and “Ole Man River” to itself 
and then stumbled through the 
ocean, trailing white ribbons across 
its full-crested bow and down its 
forty-foot length. Pryn was looking 
out a window, watching the water 
collapse as I took the gold ring and 
saw it flash in the air as it joined 
so many other memories. I hate you, 
ocean, you weak synonym for 
ocean! 

“It was most shoddy,” Noe was 
shouting over the roar of the en- 
gines, “not to have investigated. You 
see, you’re very special, Duke.” 
“Well, I’m here anyway.” 

“Yes, but where is here?” twin- 
kled Noe. 

“Do you want a metaphysical or 
geological answer?” 

He laughed. “No, I mean who are 
you really, Duke?” 

‘Thilosophy was the last thing I 
expected of you, Noe.” 

“It is and always will be,” he said. 
“You should know better than to 
take the obvious interpretation of re- 
ality. Very poor scientific method.” 
“I take it that you want another 
answer that I can’t really give.” 
“What you’ll be getting today 
should give you the answer but re- 
THE SEtCHEY KIDS 



member — ” he wagged a finger at 
me — “this principle of re-interpre- 
tation applies to even greater things. 
Remember when Lovisier once 
said: ‘The Obvious is always the 
Least.’” 

“Sure, Noe,” I said and waited 
fpr him to quote from Newton and 
Fermi . but the experiment must 
have been important for Noe to 
break from his usual habits. 

“I want you to get a tape from 
the old Institute building. It’s in the 
basement in a room where the rec- 
ords of our secret projects were 
kept. It doubled as our foture shel- 
ter and came equipped with an air- 
lock. I’ve shown Pryn an old blue- 
print where it is.” 

“And I’m the pack-mule?” I 
asked. 

“No, you’re the protection. There 
is no telling what may be left from 
the aquarium.” Noe cut the engine, 
and we coasted. “The tape you will 
bring back should teach two things.” 
And he paused as he waited for me 
to supply them. 

“I can only think of one,” I said. 
“The principle of re-interpretation” 

He smiled happily. “You’ll be a 
scientist yet, Duke. Yes, it’s a direoC 
application. The other things whids 
I felt should be revealed to you only 
after I coul(f be sure you coidd 
stand the shock. You will know who 
you are, Duke.” 

“That must be some tape,” I 
grinned. 

“It’s an oral report from John 
Gunnar, a good subordinate.” 

‘“Then we’d better be going,” I 
said to Pryn who nodded and left. 

“Duke,” Noe said before I left. 

97 




“Be careful, boy.” And he did a 
strange thing, giving me a clumsy 
hug, slipping into an awkward smile. 
Then he turned away quickly. 

P ryn was waiting for me on the 
deck of the ship. I felt her hand 
on my shoulder. Fm sorry, Duke. 
/ didn't mean to hurt you. 

“I wish I’d never met you on 
that wharf,” I said and tried to 
shrug off her hand. “Anyway, it’s 
time for me to be moving on. I’ve 
been getting restless lately.” 

I understand, she said. 

I turned away from her then be- 
cause I was tir^ of her being able 
to understand what I couldn’t. I 
strapped my wrist light on, then my 
breather, which is a miracle product 
Noe and the Institute’s technicians. 
They’re essentially an air-recycling 
helmet with portable communicators. 
A special attachment lets you 
translate the Kids’ chatter into hu- 
man speech, and an adapter which 
you hit with your chin lets you speak 
dolphin language. Unfortunately the 
breather can’t communicate inflec- 
tions or tones. Still you get so that 
you recognize different voices. I 
taped some poison-tipped spears to 
the back of the breather and picked 
up my spear gun. 

Prjm tapped my shoulder, and I 
held up the okay sign. 

White bullets, sides slick with 
silver shroud of water leapt in the 
air. Pryn slid over the side, and I 
followed with a clumsy jump. It was 
quiet underneath without complica- 
tions, just sleep. Not even any dan- 
gerous currents any more since the 
oceanographical change. 

98 



Pryn put a hand on the Kids’ 
heads and gave them instructions on 
how to get to the Institute. The Kids 
shot through the water, delighting 
in the wallless world, while we old- 
er folk followed at a mcwe sedate 
pace, swimming close to the surface. 

No one bothered to dynamite 
those parts of the City that are nav- 
igation hazards so Noe bad to step 
over one of the suburban areas 
where there is enough clearance. If 
he went further north and east the 
hotels and business offices would 
have spitted the ship with their 
spires. Only the buildings near the 
Fault collapsed; the others held up 
remarkably well, long enough to let 
their occupants drown. 

Pryn stopped me on the border 
of the business district. We go for 
six blocks and make a right, then go 
down. I nodded my understanding. 
She removed her hand as we swam 
to join the Kids, who were circling 
lazily before the hedge of buildings 
while the grown-ups talked. 

Tht buildings were silent, hidden 
in the dark, tall stone giants mired 
in the mud like the fingers of a 
swallowed giant. In the silent offices, 
over the rotting carpets, up and 
down the empty elevator shafts, fish 
swim. Crabs scuttle along the side- 
walks and floors where heels once 
clicked. And I return. 

I snapped on my wrist light when 
I had estimated the distance 
covered at six hundred yards. Pryn 
snapped hers on, and we flippered 
down into the dark, silent city. 

We fell like angels through the 
dark fluid night, legs pumping and 

IF 




flippers gently pushing at the water, 
watching the huddled shapes of the 
city grow shoulders and heads and 
teeth. My heart smashed inside my 
head, veins threatening to burst as 
we entered the City. 

Two bullet shapes shot past us 
as the Kids raced each other toward 
the floor of the City. 

I chinned the Dolphin transmit 
and braked. “Here-statement.” I 
waited until the two shapes' raced 
back to us before 1 continued down. 
I flashed my light on one of the side 
windows and read the flaking gold 
letters of a Dr. Roeke, D.D.S., and 
wondered if his skull lay some- 
where in the mud below. I felt alien 
in this new dimension as we wan- 
dered down, conscious that I was 
an experimental probing of mankind, 
descending like an actor in the City’s 
dreamed musings. 

I remember a park that my par- 
ents took *me to once, filled with 
giant sequoias and redwoods that 
drape years about themselves like 
moss. I felt alone, terribly alone. In 
daylight they seemed to sleep, but at 
ni^t in the snicker of the sly moon, 
they move and stomp and whisper 
about the number of insects &is 
year — and I knew they were talk- 
ing about me. But in my home town 
there is only an expectant dimness, 
covered with slime and mud. 

You're afraid, Pryn said as she 
touched my shoulder. 

I shook my head, and she knew 
that I lied. She shrugged, and we 
swam on, over the park with its 
flower beds and benches, where the 
sunlight seemed to wait forever for 
you on the grass but the grass was

gone and the trees dead in the salt 
water. Then down belo^I saw the 
U-^aped buildings of the Institute. 

We paused above the center plaza 
with its red tiles now coated with 
ocean droppings, and the fountain 
with its twisted whales, non-function- 
al, submerged in the element it once 
played with. 

1 chinned Dolphin transmit. 
“Stop-statement.” 

“Here-question,” asked Ossie twist- 
ing his t^dy about the middle to 
point at the Institute. 

“Affirmative-statement,” I said. 

Together with Pryn I swam to- 
ward the Institute. The doors were 
stiff, refusing to swing in so I shot a 
belt through the door. Loading the 
spear gun, I held it in my left hand 
while I cracked some of the pieces 
from the hole in the glass. I swore 
as I cut my hand on the glass, and 
Pryn tried to stop the blood that 
ribboned the water. In my wrist 
light, aimed casually inside, a dark 
blur stirred. I shov^ Pryn roughly 
against the wall, shielding her with 
my body as a giant shape smashed 
through the glass, tossing shards ev- 
erywhere. Flashing in my light as it 
turned for another pass, I could see 
the shark’s teeth. I shot a belt that 
arched over his back. Then it was 
charging, and I dropped the spear 
gun as I twisted my body, dodging 
and squirming around its teeth. 

4 4 T^anger-statement,” I shouted to 

jlJ the Kids as I pulled a spare 
spear from my back. The teeth came 
terribly close to my hand as I twist- 
ed out of the way. I jabbed with the 
spear, but the water robbed my blows 

99 




of any force. Death is a pantomime 
beneath the water, fought in a dream 
ballet; and out of the dream a gray 
bullet crashed into the shark’s side. 

“Kill-statement,” said Ossie. 

The shark rolled away, righting 
itself with a flip of its tail. Then an- 
other gray bullet slammed into its 
side, and the shark rolled away again, 
biting in vain at the gray blur. The 
Kids circled the shark slowly almost 
lazily. Ossie broke from the circle, 
smashing into the shark once more. 

The shark tried to run away but 
the Kids, ramming its side one after 
another, herded it back toward the 
Institute. The shark circled warily, 
trying to keep track of both the 
Kids. Pryn joined my side with the 
gun that I had dropped. She pulled 
one of the spears from my back and 
aimed carefully. 

I touched her arm. 7 won*t hit the 
Kids, she assured me, and I let her 
go. I don’t argue with Pryn. I was 
humbled long ago. 

With a cry of Kill, Ossie detached 
himself from the circle and smashed 
into the shark’s blind side. The shark 
rolled, righting itself again, and 
paused momentarily to glare about, 
belly exposed. Pryn fired. I watched 
the poison-tipped spear lodge in the 
shark’s belly. The shark rolled in 
the water. It might have been in- 
ternal hemorrhaging caused by the 
Kids that finally reached the shark’s 
brain or the fast-acting poison, but 
after convulsing in the water, the 
shark went limp and floated gently 
to the floor of the plaza. The kids 
still circled over the shark. Then Os- 
sie broke from the circle and cau- 
tiously nudged it. 

100 



Satisfied, the Kids came swim- 
ming to us then. Pryn touched both 
of them, and they chattered pleasant- 

ly. 

I chinned Dolphin-transmit and 
said, “Brood-live,” caressing their 
sides. 

“What’s happening down there,” 
Noe crackled his voice robbed of 
inflection. “T heard you shout and 
the dolphins cry Kill. Is everyone 
all right?” 

“I just cut my hand, Noe,” I said. 

“Well, be careful, it might draw 
predatory fish,” he said. 

I smiled and took the gun from 
Pryn, using it as a battering ram to 
enlarge the hole that the shark had 
made. Then I loaded the gun and 
told the Kids to stay put. Twisting 
my body through the hole, I flashed 
my beam around the room. 

“Noe, how many teeth does a 
shark have?” 

“It depends upon the species, 
why?” 

“‘Scientific curiosity,” I said and 
then waved for Pryn to join me. She 
twisted through the door and to- 
gether we flippered through the lob- 
by where they had once kept the al- 
ligators in a pit. I held the gun 
ready as I flashed my light about 
the different corners, but there were 
only the leering shadows.

I dly I read the headings over the 
tanks in the corridors. The rail- 
ings that had prevented the children 
from standing too close displayed 
shoulders of red rust. Salt water ate

blurred to my right; and I raised the 
gun in my right h^d until my left 
cauglht a sea horse in its beam* 

Pryn stopped before a door. A skel- 
eton lay before it, tattered rags cling- 
ing to its white-ridged chest. I open- 
ed it hesitantly and flashed my light 
around in the darkness below. I 
swam over the skeleton in front of 
the door and down the stairs. The 
touch of a gently current told me 
that Pryn was swimming beside me. 

We were in a large room, filled 
with shelves that reached upward 
for ten feet. The fragments of books 
and bound papers rotted on the 
shelves. Pryn beamed her light at a 
door in the rear wall, and we flip- 
pered to it. 

I gave her the gun, and she cov- 
ered me while 1 strained at the 
wheel, turning the rusting inner 
parts. With a last screech, the tum- 
blers clicked, and the door opened 
with a clang as the water push^ me 
into the lock with it. I held myself 
off the wall when Pryn bumped 
against me as the water pulled her 
into the small room too. I waited 
until the room was almost filled 
before I pressed a button in front 
of me. The outer door slowly closed 
behind us, creaking mechanically. 
It lent my weight to it and with a 
final shove the outer door closed. 
Almost immediately a pump chuck- 
led somewhere, and the water level 
began lowering. When I heard a soft 
hiss of air being pumped in, I let 
the breather hang down my back 
and took the gun from Pryn. 

As soon as all the water had been 
pumped out except for a thin film, 
the inner door slid open. There was 
THE SELCHEY KIDS 



an electric light in the doorway 
which activated the room lights as 
1 stepped through* 

*‘They must have a small gener- 
ator in here.’* 1 sniffed at the air. 
’‘And a re-cycling plant for the air. 
Noe wasn’t kidding when he said 
that they were prepared for any- 
thing. 

Pryn took my hand. For almost 
everything, 

“Who expected the Flood?” I said 
as she drew her hand put of mine. 

Pryn held up a finger for me to 
wait and, slipping out of her flippers, 
went into the next room. I looked 
about the small room and its filing 
cabinets around the walls. There 
were two desks in the room with 
typewriters and by one a small tape 
recorder. 

I went over to one filing cabinet 
and slid out one drawer, leaving a 
little puddle in the room where the 
water trailed down my legs. I slip- 
ped off my flippers and took an 
armful of folders over to the desks. 

Idly I flipped through, the folders 
skimmin g over the titles which Pryn 
would have explained to me if she 
had been around. Then one caught 
my eye: “Experimental Crossbreed- 
ing No. 57.” 

M y father had been a geneticist, 
Noe had told me, one of the 
best — naturally. But slowly as I 
read, the words burned themselves 
into my mind. I shivered in my wet 
suit. 

“Reports on radiation-treated dol- 
phin cells . successful fertilization 
... in tube . growth encouraging 
... in artificial womb . perfectly

Will it be an idiot? . normal birth

sponds to stimuli . tests indicate 
astonishing intelligence for age level, 
but can we measure by human stan- 
dards? ... As cranial capacity of 
dolphins is greater than man . 
Outwardly shaped like homo sapiens, 
but what is dolphinus sapiens? . 
Christened ...” 

A hand touched my shoulder at 
the moment. What are you doing? 
Pryn asked. 

I gave the folder over to Pryn. 
“Do you know what they were do- 
ing at the Institute before the Flood?” 
Words rushed out without consid- 
eration now. “They were making 
test-tube babies, babies of a differ- 
ent species!” 

Pryn took my hand and looked 
at me quietly. Noe had told me 
about it. Does it mean that much? 

“Yes!” I grabbed her and shook 
her. “The report said that thing was 
growing with a high intelligence 
and — ” 

T he words trailed off my tongue 
like beads of water I looked 
about at the room, which suddenly 
seemed very small and very menac- 
ing. 

“Let’s get out of here fast,” I 
said, pulling her toward the open 
airlock. She pulled back. 

Does that make the creature a 
monster? she demanded, squeezing 
my hand. 

“It’s an alien. Its ancestors were 
dolphins.” 

Like Ollie and Ossie? 

102 



“They’re different,” I said feel- 
ing exasperation form ribs about my 
chest, imagining the alien creature 
listening on the other side of the 
walls. “They don’t masquerade like 
men. This thing ... it walks like 
a man, talks like them for all we 
know. Its genes were sculpted and 
molded. It’s not natural.” 

**What if it died in the Flood?** 
asked Pryn. 

“Fine. It’s dead.” I stopped drag- 
ging her across the floor and looked 
at her instead. 

And if it lived?, she asked, her 
hand tightening. 

“Then,” I said quietly, “I’ll have 
to kill it. We can’t allow it to live.” 

We? shrieked Pryn and ran for 
airlock as I stared at her, the tum- 
blers of the ridiculous logic slowly 
clicked to constrict my panicked 
mind in their cold mechanical touch. 

“Pryn, no?” I said desperately as 
the door slid shut. I ran for the door 
and pushed the button for the door 
to open, which it would after it had 
cycled Pryn. I tried to open the d^r 
with my hands but found no opening 
as water slowly danced into the oth- 
er room. I banged savagely on the 
door and shouted, “I’m sorry, Pryn.” 

My fists slid down the smooth sur- 
face, and I turned back toward the 
desks. There was a tape on one that 
Pryn must have placed there. I lis- 
tened to the lock recycling, then 
threaded the tape through the tape 
recorder. I sat down in the chair 
and smiled at my father’s voice de- 
spite what had happened. 

“Report for the Board of Direc- 
tors upon Crossbreeding Experiment 
No. 103. The infant, named Deuca- 

IF 




lion or Duke, has responded to all 
tests successfully. There is every in- 
dication that the experiment will be 
as successful as No. 57. The infant 
will not have to be destroyed as were 
the others.” 

T he words trickled down my 
mind from my icicle spine as 
the magnetic tape went on with the 
dead man’s thoughts. 

‘‘Using Director Noe Selchey’s 
spermatazoa and a dolphin ovum 
carefully developed by radiation as 
in experiment No. 57, the fertilized 
egg was — ” 

I left my father talking so calmly 
about the intelligence of his adopted 
son. To be conceived out of wedlock 
is one thing but to be conceived me- 
chanically in a test tube is another. 
I have passions and blood inside me 
. and now I find that the passions 
and blood spring from a cold mar- 
ble top under the glare of bright 
surgical lights. 

I grabbed my gun and entered the 
airlock, putting on my flippers and 
waiting impatiently during the recy- 
cling process. “Pryn,” I shouted once 
but the thick shelter walls kept her 
name in with me. I swam out of the 
lock; and the small, memory-filled 
room where my identity stalked me 
in the dark waters. I swam up the 
stairs and over the skeleton at the 
doorway. 

“Pryn,” I shouted down the long 
corridors and snapped on my wrist 
light. Then it came like a hammer 
smashing into my mind like a pick. 

“Kill-statement.” Emotions roll- 
ed on green-oiled feet like those 
huge waves of the Flood. Fear. Re- 
THE SELCHEY KIDS 



vulsion. Then my soul crashed to 
the floor and my spine was ripped 
from ipy body. Contact, flesh to 
flesh. Blackness. 

“Kill-question?” came a faint 
voice like OUie’s dipped in static. 

“Affirmation-statement,” said 01- 
lie. 1 cursed the darkness and the 
mechanical reproduction that robbed 
voices of meaning. 

I chinned Dolphin-transmit and 
shouted, “What’s happening?” Then 
m silence I swore at the complex 
question. 

1 chinned Dolphin-hransmit again 
and asked. “Danger-questions?” 

“Kill-statement,” came Ossie’s cry. 

“Brood-love (meaning one of us 
four), danger-question?” I asked. 

“Kill-statement,” was OUie’s only 
answer. 

I swam down the corridors, ignor- 
ing any of the shapes that might lin- 
ger in the shadows. I charged across 
the lobby and stared at the gaping 
hole where the door had been and 
the cru^ed masonry like a mound 
of skulls set upon the steps, I looked 
through the door and saw a large 
blot, fifteen feet high, in the distance. 
Its jelly-like sac was translucent and 
wri^^ with three clumps of ten- 
tacles set evenly on the sides. Near 
the top of the sac was a large eye. 
In one of the clumps of tentacles 
was a dark, pale slash that was Pryn. 

“Kill-statement,” cried Ossie and 
smashed into the creature’s side. The 
creature whirled, its bulk too big for 
the Kids to move. Ossie darted away 
to circle above. 

“Kill-statement,” shouted Ollie 
and dove down, smashing into the 
creature’s blind side; and the crea- 
tes 




ture whirled frantically, trying to 
seize one of its tormentors. 

“What’s happening down there, 
Duke?” demanded Noe. 

“Some monster’s got Pryn,” I said 
and raised my gun to fire. 

“Kill-statement,” chorused two 
shapes darting out of the night of 
the ocean to thud into the body 
flailing awkwardly at them. 

“Does it resemble an octopus and 
does it have three bunches of arms 
on the sides? 

“Yeah, and it looks as big as Al- 
catraz Island. Are you finished play- 
ing twenty questions?” I sighted at 
the shape, not wanting to hit Pym 
when it whirled. Two bullets like ex- 
tensions of my eyes came smashing 
into the pale white flesh of the crea- 
ture. 

“Don’t shoot,” said Noe urgently. 
“It’s your brother.” 



w/ 





4CT don’t see any family resem- 

X blance,” I said and swam clos- 
er to make sure my shot would be 
true. 

“Kill-statement,” cried the Kids 
and smashed down in a sheathing of 
small bubbles. The creature whirled 
again, raising small, obscuring clouds 
of muck. 

“You’re not completely human, 
Duke,” said Noe. 

“I heard the tape,” I said and 
caught the sob almost coming out 
of my throat. 

“I have no children,” Noe went 
on, “and well, you know almost all 
of the rest. But I also provided irra- 
diated spermatazoa for several other 
fertilizations. That’s a fertilized oc- 
topus ovum.” 

THE SELCHEY KIDS 



“What experiment is he?” I de- 
manded as the dirt clouds settled. 

“Pryn is No. 57. Her success en- 
couraged us. You’re No. 103. Num- 
ber 203 is your brother,” said Noe. 
“From his size he grew since the 
Flood. Don’t kill him, Duke. He’s 
your flesh and blood.” 

I laughed harshly at that. 

“Kill-statement,” chorused the 
Kids again. And suddenly, over 
Noe’s commands and the Kids* cries, 
revulsion, not the sick, twisted feel- 
ing of my half-heritage, but revul- 
sion at the slick, strange creature in 
my arm-extensions. Then pain at the 
biiUet creatures that whirled out of 
night and smashed into me. Hate for 
all the smooth-skinned creatures. 
Kill. From the mud and slime, I 
whirled but the elusive creatures 
darted away. Kill. 

I raised my gun and fired. I 
watched the spear shoot straight for 
the Eye that watched in curiosity. 
Like Cain I watched the blood spurt 
from the wound I had made in my 
brother. Blood plumed out. Pain. I 
grasped my head with my free hand 
and hunched over. Pain. Red Pain. 
My life. Tender isolation. Abundant 
small smooth-skin creatures to feed 
me. The isolation broken. Hatred at 
the invaders. My lovely, lonely life 
in the darkness now flowing out of 
me. Pain. 

The creature’s sac swelled, and on 
a }et of water it shot deep into the 
blackness of the City; but it still 
held Pryn. 

I tasted the blood oozing from 
the lips I had bit. 

“Hurt-statement,” said Ossie swim- 
ming toward me.

“‘You can’t kill your own broth-

“Will you show some feeling, you

“I am very broken up about it,” 
said Noe, but the breather robbed it 
of any emotion.

dorsal fin and we swam after Piyn. 

“I can’t do anydiing,” replied Noe 
and he paused. “1 love ymi all.” 

“S3iut I shouted to Noe. 

Up ahead, dim in the light , was a 
white sac, I shut my mind to the 
pain flowing from it like its blood. 
Then suddenly it swelled its dieeks 
as we neared and shot over the park 
toward die tall stalks of stone and 
steeL In my light we passed small 
streamers of blood, like ribbons toss- 
ed away and floating gently down. 

On toe edge of toe business dis- 
trict it paused, then shot ahead to 
smash into a building, lodging for a 
moment in toe hole it had made, 
then gently eased down toe side of 
the building, the white cheek of 
Pryn held out free and safe from the 
building. We shot down toward toe 
creature as it slumped limp upon 
the sidewalk. The Kids circled wari- 
ly while 1 swam to toe still form of 
Pryn. 1 felt her heart and its beating, 
then turned toward toe creature. 

The creature idly waved a clump 
106 



of tentacles at me. All the turbulent 
thoughts of my ancestry and its tum- 
bled away into toe creature’s mind. 
Kid, came toe thought, tinged with 
regret. 1 i^aced a spear into my gun 
and swam toward it. Fain, Kill. Stop. 

The creature opened its mouth be- 
low its eye. Inside toe slit, a pink 
mouth sh^ed, and a small row of 
white teeth. 

Kill, came the plea. I squeezed 
the trigger and witdied toe spear 
enter sink into toe soft skin. Tlie 
flap closed over toe i^ar, sucking 
at toe toaft. The creature convulsed. 
Flesh-to-flesh, question? 

Hesitantly I reached a hand to- 
ward its skill. My own flesh felt as 
if it was crawling back up my arm, 
but I touched him. 

Brood-love question? came the 
trembling toou^t, edged wito black 
isolation, as the blood slowly extend- 
ed feelers into the dark sea. 

“Affirmation, brother,” I said and 
the flicker of light died and toe crea- 
ture was still. 

“Danger-statement,” said Ossie. 

“Negation-statement,” I said and 
lifted my hand from my brother’s 
puckered flesh. 

“What’s happening,” asked Noe. 

“I’m just cleaning up your mess- 
es,” I said quietly. “Lower a hook.” 

“What for?” demanded Noe. 

“So I can bury my brother,” I 
snapped and then went to Pryn and 
swam up to the surface where the 
sunlight was still playing. Then with 
OUie and Ossie’s help I brought my 
brother up to fill the deck of the 
ship. I'd bury my brother on the 
land where he could be eaten by 
worms and enjoy his heritage.

1 looked out at the light that flaked 
off from the sun, shruggiiig off 
Noe’s questions and duaisy apolo- 
gies. It seems that the Kids are my 
step-brother and step-sister on my 
mother’s side, thank God. 1 laughed 
at the irony and then Juddered. 1 
fought the urge of my hands to claw 
at my flesh, to pick out each atom 
of dolphin. I envied my brother who 
haH falcon death SO Calmly in the 
end, after the pain of living had been 
too great. 

“Duke?” Pryn called, stirring at 
my feet. I stopped thinking about my 
new identity and took her groping 
hand from my ankle and treasured 
it between my half-human hands. 

“I’m here,” I said. And I shook in 
the wind that blew from the bay. I 
looked at the shattered eye, lid stop- 
ped from closing by the spear. A lit- 
tle red stream triclded down like the 
tears from mine. I wish I couldn’t 
see. 

What was that? she asked. 

“Not what. Who,” corrected. “It’s 
my brother.” 

No, and I saw the horror in her 
face and felt her hand shrink for 
a second from mine. I knew how 
Pryn felt to be condemned for hM’ 
ancestry. I laughed quietly, because 
what did that make me — who could 
neither be one way or the other? 

“And I’m the same as he. I can’t 
even claim your pure ancestry.” I 
raised my head to the bloody-eyed 
sun and shook the tears from my 
eyes. “Why did you ever come to 
me on the wharf?” 

What? Then her hand tightened 
THE SELCHEY KIDS 



on mine as she realized what 1 in- 
tended. No, die omnumded as I 
raised the spear gun dowly to aim 
at my head. 

“You can’t stop me this time like 
you did before. I have better rea- 
sons now,” 1 said quietly and pulled 
the trigger. Her hand grabbed at my 
arm but too late. I smiled trium- 
phantly as the pain shelved my mind 
into a deep, daric secret folder and 
filed under B for Black. The Sel- 
diey Boys togeth^. 

My mind exists no more. Sense, 
pain, wmry have been dropped 
away. Loneliness deeper than the 
shell my brother possessed in. the In- 
stitute possesses me now. Waste and 
I feel regret. Eye, I will eyes for my 
regret and they open, to Pryn, shin- 
ing like the sun over me. 

G old flowed into me. The dark- 
ness retreats, and the sadness 
mellows, hammers into images to be 
known and used later. I felt her arm 
sheltering me in its curves. Softly 
the barriers of my mind slip one by 
one before her; and I know, not lone- 
liness, but a total new world, a world 
that belongs to Pryn, and I relax. 

I felt the bandage on my head. 
“I’m not dead?” I asked stupidly. 

She tapped a finger against my 
forehead. Too dense, she said and 
smiled. And I knew that she had 
been in time after all. 

“All right,” I said. I had come 
two thousand miles to find myself 
in the City and on the City I would 
build something new. The search be- 
gun on a wet hilltop; in the middle 
of the Flood the searcher is found. 
The symbols are calmed, not dead.

Z n the Spring of 1978 an alien 
spaceship enters the Solar Sys-

the Sun. Every major telescope, both 
astronomical and radio, which can 
be brought to bear is directed at 



the Ship, which neither signals nor

Judgment Fled 



by JAMES WHITE 



Illustrated by MORROW 

T/te ship was hopelessly alien, 
and Earth was very far away. 

What was there left to hope for? 




the intruder. As a result there is re- 
layed back to Earth a series of low- 
definition pictures of a vessel which 
is half a mile long and shaped like 
a blunt torpedo with a pattern of 
bulges encircling its mid-section. 

The Ship orbits silently and, some 
think, implacably, like some vast 
battleship cruising off the coast of 
a tiny, backward island. Inevitably 
there are natives who want an even 
closer look; and two small, sophisti- 
cated dugout canoes are modified 
and readied for launching. 

Choosing the men for the Pro- 
metheus Project is no easy task. If 
the human race is to derive the max- 
imum benefit from this first con- 
tact with a highly advanced alien 
culture — always assuming, of 
course, that the extra-terrestrial 
crew is friendly — the six men must 
represent the widest possible spread 
of the social and physical sciences. 
In addition they must be capable of 
surviving the longest and most haz- 
ardous journey in human history 
and of asking the right questions at 
the erui of it. 

And so, despite the hundreds of 
eminent and respected scientists who 
volunteer for the trip, the final de- 
cision lies with the space medics. 
They insist on sending six men un- 
known in the higher scientific cir- 
cles and respected only by their 
friends — four experienced astro- 
nauts and two who are still under 
training. These six will, it is thought, 
stand a fairly good chance of bring- 
ing home the bacon. 

It is perhaps significant that none 
of the men chosen to crew the two 
P-ships are married. 



In p-Two there is McCullough, 
d doctor and nominally a lieutenant 
colonel who has been undergoing 
training for MOL service, and vet- 
eran pilots Captain BERRYMAN 
and Major WALTERS. P-One*s 
crew consists of Colonel MORRI- 
SON, the leader of the expedition, 
and Major DREW, both of whom 
are trained astronauts. The third 
man is Captain HOLLIS, a physicist 
engaged on ion-drive research. On 
Earth the project is headed by Gen- 
eral BRADY. 

During the voyage they are given 
lectures every day in the hope of 
preparing them for the widest pos- 
sible contact with the aliens. There 
is no time to feel bored or even lone- 
ly. With the help of the two pilots 

McCullough finds himself 

adapting to the cramped living con- 
ditions. But the atmosphere in P- 
One is not quite so pleasant, and 
McCullough is requested by 
MORRISON to undertake an ex- 
tended period of EVA involving a 
fifty-mile trip to the other ship in 
order to treat the physicist HOL- 
LIS. On the P-One he becomes dis- 
oriented and is nearly lost. 

When they eventually reach the 
Ship everything they do, say or see 
is relayed back to Prometheus Con- 
trol, who in turn relay it to all the 
radio networks of the world. Prac- 
tically every adult member of the 
human race is listening, and the ex- 
citement is intense. General BRADY 
tries to direct operations from Earth 
but does little more than worry out 
loud. 

But the P-ship men need no re- 
minding of the importance of what 



110 



IF 




they are about to do. They approach 
the Ship cautiously but openly, ad- 
vertising their presence continuous- 
ly with radio signals and flares. 
After nearly a day of this MORRI- 
SON, realizing that the aliens either 
can't or won't answer, orders WAL- 
TERS and McCullough to 
board the Ship. 

The two men are able to operate 
one of the airlock actuators and 
spend several hours investigating the 
lock chamber, still without any re- 
action from the Ship's crew. They 
gain some valuable data on the 
aliens and their planet of origin. In 
an attempt to obtain a sample of the 
Ship's atmosphere they close the 
lock's outer seal and open the en- 
trance to the corridor. WALTERS 
risks taking a look along the corri- 
dor and is attacked by a dimly seen, 
tentacled alien and has his space- 
suit slashed. McCULLOUGH is 
sure that the alien atmosphere of the 
Ship will kill him, but discovers 
that the air is breathable. 

WALTERS is moved back to the 
P-ships, which have now been join- 
ed together, in a borrowed space- 
suit. He will not be able to leave 
his command module until they re- 
turn home or until another suit is 
sent out to them, because they do 
not carry spares. 

BRADY blames MORRISON 
and the others for mishandling the 
situation, and after a bitter argu- 
ment it is decided that they will 
risk further offending the aliens by 
making one more visit to the Ship 
— HOLLIS insists that he can learn 
the operating principles of the ves- 
sel's propulsion system from a close 
ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



Study of its generating equipment, 
and that in any case the expedition 
has come too far just to turn and 
go home again. The result is a run- 
ning fight with the alien crew mem- 
bers in which one of the extra-ter- 
restrials is killed and the spacesuits 
of MORRISON, DREW and BER- 
RYMAN are damaged beyond re- 
pair, which means that three men 
are now marooned aboard the alien 
ship. 

Public reaction to the fight is 
both violent and confused. Because 
of the blow-by-blow radio coverage 
everyone at home feels personal in- 
volvment with the situation, and 
they have their own ideas how it 
should be handled. BRADY reflects 
the wildly vacillating public opinion 
so closely that at one point he 
threatens not to let the men have 
supplies or spare spacesuits unless 
they behave properly, but at the 
same time he can't or won't give 
clear-cut instructions on how they 
should handle the situation. Mc- 
CULLOUGH loses his temper and 
tells the general that because he 
does not know what to do himself 
he is making scapegoats of the peo- 
ple at the Ship. He adds that as the 
men on the spot are experts, the 
only experts, on alien contact they 
should not have to give too much 
weight to the opinions of people sit- 
ting at desks sixty million miles 
away. He decides that it might be 
a good idea not to tell BRADY ev- 
erything that happens . 

During the five weeks it takes 
for the high-G supply rocket to 
reach them, McCULLOUGH, HOL- 
LIS and the three marooned men 

111 




explore as much as possible of the 
alien ship. McCULLOUGH has per-- 
formed an autopsy on the alien they 
killed and in addition much valu- 
able technical information is passed 
to WALTERS for relaying home. 
MORRISON and a number of aliens 
are killed. The aliens are vicious, in- 
sensate killers who ignore all at- 
tempts at establishing communica- 
tions. McCullough forms a the- 
ory about them and their ship — 
he thinks they may be the descen- 
dants of lab animals who have es- 
caped and overrun the Ship, killing 
its crew and leaving the vessel to 
operate under .. automatic control. 
But this theory, he realizes, is in 
part merely an excuse to decrease 
the guilt he feels for the mess they 
have all made of the situation, and 
an equally feasible explanation might 
be that the Ship*s crew or their de- 
scendants have devolved into sav- 
agery for some reason which is not 
yet clear and that they are not 
wholly responsible for their actions. 

BRADY begins to suspect that 
certain things are being kept from 
him and brings psychological pres- 
sure to bear on WALTERS, who is 
now isolated on P-One while he 
mans the two-way radio link be- 
tween the Ship and Earth. This an- 
gers McCullough and the ma- 
rooned men even more because 
physically and emotionally they are 
all in poor shape. 

On the Ship they uncover evi- 
dence which supports McCUL- 
LOUGH*S theory regarding the 
non-intelligence of the creatures in- 
festing the vessel — a block of 
wrecked cages containing food and 
112 



water-dispensing machinery — and 
the absence of intelligent extra-ter- 
restrials, when suddenly they hear 
aUen voices blaring at them from 
loudspeakers. Simultaneously a mes- 
sage reaches them from WALTERS 
to say that the vesseVs propulsors 
are beginning to glow. 

The Ship is leaving! 

XV 

F or the first few seconds McCul- 
lough’s feeling was one of out- 
rage rather than fear. This was go- 
ing too far, he thought; being ma- 
rooned* on the Ship, running short 
of water, under nearly constant at- 
tack by ^iens, the deaths of Colonel 
Morrison and Drew. This was piling 
on the agony and taking misfortune 
to ridiculous extremes. The Ship 
couldn*t be leavingl 

But Berryman kept babbling on 
about Walters and the glow emanat- 
ing from the interior of the trans- 
parent generator blisters and the in- 
terference which was being picked 
up by P-Two’s radio, all of which 
indicated a steady build-up of power 
within the Ship. Then there was the 
constant gabbling of the Twos, the 
chiming, the alien voices and moan- 
ing sound pouring out of the wall 
speaker. If the Ship was leaving Mc- 
Cullough would be expected to do 
something about it, react in some 
fashion, make decisions, give orders 
now. 

He couldn’t. 

The problem was too big and 
complicated for quick decisions and 
inspired leadership — at least, so 
far as he was concerned. He had to 
^ IF 




put it into some sort of order in 
his mind, take time to consider the 
events in consecutive fashion and 
break the problem down, even 
though they might have no time at 
all. He must go back past Berry- 
man’s arrival to the time when Drew 
was alive. 

McCullough’s mind came to a 
sudden halt at that point and ground 
into reverse. Drew might very well 
be still alive. Now that he had time 
to think about it the more likely it 
became. He pointed at the mesh and 
at Drew and tried to speak. 

What he wanted to say was that 
the mesh was electrified and they 
should stay clear of it, and that 
Drew’s weapon had touched it while 
the haft was in contact with the 
floor, so that the flash had been a 
short along the shaft of the spear. 
He wanted to tell them that in his 
opinion the mesh was not too highly 
charged — the way he saw it there 
should be just enough kick in it to 
keep the captive animals under con- 
trol — and in any case Drew had 
been wearing his suit gauntlets 
which would give him added pro- 
tection. Considering the gauntlets 
and the fact that the discharge had 
gone through the weapon and not by 
way of Drew’s body, he tried to say, 
there was a good chance that prompt 
resuscitation measures would save 
him. But all he could do was stam- 
mer and point. He could not make 
them understand or even hold their 
attention. 

Hollis shouted something at him, 
but a chime from the speaker a few 
inches from McCullough’s ear kept 
him from hearing what the physicist 
ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



had said. But Berryman was closer 
to Hollis and replied. Hollis pulled 
Drew’s weapon out of the air and 
added it to the one already in his 
hand, shouted something at McCul- 
lough, then launched himself back in 
the direction from which they had 
just come. Berryman looked from 
the physicist’s fast disappearing feet 
to McCullough and back again, 
waved and followed. 

It had been impossible to hear 
what either of them had been saying 
over the cacophony of chimes, 
moaning, squabbling Twos and the 
alien duet. 

McCullough could understand 
Hollis ru nnin g away. The physicist 
was wearing one of the two remain- 
ing undamaged spacesuits, and there 
was a chance that he could make it 
to the airlock and to the P-ships in 
time. But why was the pilot run- 
ning away? Surely Berryman did not 
think that he could take Hollis’s 
suit away from him, after fighting 
him for it and knocking him un- 
conscious? The only result of such 
a fight would be another ruptured 
spacesuit. 

N ot knowing what to think and 
feeling bitterly disappointed in 
both of them, McCullough opened 
his visor and dived slowly toward 
Drew. In the weightless condition 
and with an electrified mesh just a 
few feet away there was only one 
method of resuscitation possible. 
McCullough did his best to ignore 
the alien voices rattling at him from 
the speaker, the gobbles and wheep- 
ing sounds coming from the Twos 
and the all-pervading moaning and 

113 




chiming. He concentrated instead 
on adniinistenng the Kiss of Life to 
the dead or unconsdon^Drew. 

But finding Drew’s mouth was 
like ducking for apples in a tub of 
water at Halloween. The pilot’s 
head kept bobbing away and roll- 
ing flabbily about inside his helmet. 
Finally, by sliding one hand care- 
fully into the helmet and supporting 
the back of Drew’s neck with his 
fingers, McCullough was able to 
press the other’s face forward into 
the visor opening. 

Results came quickly after that. 

Gasping and choking and strug- 
gling like a drowning man, Drew 
began to come to. He flung one arm 
aroimd McCullough’s neck so tight- 
ly that the doctor thought his helmet 
would come off and possibly his 
head as well. He was able to hold 
Drew clear of the electrified mesh 
until the pilot settled down, then he 
detached the arm from around his 
neck. 

For some reason McCullough 
was feeling unusually well disposed 
toward the pilot. Possibly this was 
because he might have been instru- 
mental in saving the other’s life and 
this made him feel a vaguely God- 
like possessiveness and concern for 
this life he might have saved. As 
well, there was the fact that Drew 
would be the only company avail- 
able if the other two did not come 
back. And after everything the pilot 
had been through he did not want 
to add to Drew’s troubles by telling 
him that the Ship was leaving, even 
though every instinct he possessed 
seemed to be urging him to get to 
the nearest airlock and jump for the 
114 



|P-shi^ while he had the chance. 
Drew was mumbling something at 
him, looking very awkward and em- 
barrassed. 

Obviously the chimes and alien 
voices were some kind of pre-take- 
off warning. While they continued, 
which they were, there was still a 
chance for him to leave the Ship. 

‘T can’t hear you,” he said hur- 
riedly to the pilot. “But there’s no 
need to thank me. You probably 
wouldn’t have died anyway.” 

“You mustn’t think I meant it 
personally,” Drew broke in, speak- 
ing loudly but with his awkwardness 
still very much in evidence. “It was 
just that your hand and your mouth 
... I mean, there was a girl at 
home who , . who .... For a min- 
ute I thought .... Damnit, Doc, I 
don’t want you thinking I’m some 
kind of pervert or anything!” 

Get out of here! screamed a voice 
in McCullough’s mind, while anoth- 
er pointed out the ridiculous, almost 
insane humor of the situation and 
urged him to laugh — while yet an- 
other voice, calmer and more clini- 
cal, reminded him that so far as 
Drew was concerned this was a very 
serious matter and he should avoid 
hurting the pilot’s feelings. 

“The thought,” said McCullough 
with the ring of absolute truth and 
sincerity in his voice, “never entered 
my mind. But if you look in the en- 
closure you’ll see the Twos are be- 
ginning to lose interest in their feed- 
ing. We had better leave before they 
see us.” 

“What hapened to my spear?” 
said Drew. “Where are Hollis and 
Berryman? It is very bad tactics to 

IF 




split up our force like this, sirl” 
Drew was his old self again, ob- 
viously, and McCullough felt less 
hesitation about passing on the bad 
news of the Ship leaving and the 
desertion of Hollis and Benyman. 
But he was saved the trouble. Ber- 
ryman was with them again, hang- 
ing onto the wall-net and trying to 
talk and catch his breath at the same 
time. 

He was giving Drew a startled, I- 
I - didn’t-expect-to-see-you-alive-again 
sort of look while he spoke to Mc- 
Cullough. He said, “Sorry for leav- 
ing you . , . without permission . 
just now. I got excited and took off 
. without thinking. When you 
gave Captain Hollis the idea for . 
for shorting the generator with the 
metal spears ... he told nae he 
needed help. He still does, inside the 
blister. You have the only other 
working spacesuit, sir. We haven’t 
much time . ” 

U ntil then McCullough had not 
been aware that he had given 
an idea to anyone. But he realized 
at once what Hollis was try to 
do because they had discussed just 
this eventuality several times. In gen- 
eral, that was. He would have to 
wait until they reached the genera- 
tor blister to see what particular 
form of sabotage the physicist had 
been able to devise. 

On the way they surprised a not 
quite fully grown Two at an in- 
tersection. Being unarmed. Drew 
and Berryman grabbed two tenta- 
cles each, twisted their feet into the 
wall-net and swung it hard and re- 
peatedly against a projecting brack- 
ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



et until its carapace split and it 
st(q>ped moving. Berryman looked 
sli^tly sick; and Drew, who had de- 
vised this particular method of un- 
armed combat, muttered something 
about neatness and dispatch. 

McCullough wondered why such 
complimentary terms were used to 
describe such a vicious and despic- 
able act. But with every wall-speaker 
erupting chimes and a continuous 
alien gabble and with the knowledge 
that all around them the generators 
which could whisk them away to 
some alien solar system building up 
to full power, if was impossible to 
behave in an ethical and moral 
manner. It was impossible, McCul- 
lough thought cynically, because so 
very few human beings were capable 
of such behavior in the present cir- 
cumstances, and if enough people 
considered it impossible so it was. 

For four frightened astronauts 
read fifty million Frenchmen who 
could not be wrong, and for fifty 
million Frenchmen read the whole 
human race .... 

For a moment the thought came 
to him of traveling an unguessable 
number of light-'years to another so- 
lar system, of seeing an alien world 
and its culture and having ^contact 
with true, extra-terrestrial intelli- 
gences — even if only briefly, as 
an animal they might consider of 
too little interest or importance to 
keep alive. The idea of not helping 
the physicist, of ordering Hollis to 
cease attempting to sabotage the 
generator, came. And was hurriedly 
rejected. The sudden, awful won- 
der of his original thought was 
quickly overwhelmed by fear. 



115 




They passed quickly through the 
lock chamber aad the int^-hull 
space where th^ fkst major brush 
vith the Twos had occurred, and on 
to the lock which gave access to the 
generator blister. Hollis* legs showed 
in the transparent panel of the inner 
seal. 

As McCullough was joining him, 
Berryman placed his antenna against 
the bulkhead and said, “Walters is 
pulling away under steering power. 
Doctor. Hollis says there are likely 
to be gravitational side effects if the 
Ship generators reach full power. 
He says the P-ships might be suck- 
ed in and suggested that Walters 
move out to at least five miles, so 
that someone would be able to tell 
Earth what happened to the rest of 
us . .” 

Listening to him, McCullough 
wondered: if the sabotage attempt 
was unsuccessful, and if he wasn’t 
killed by it, and if he could get to 
an airlock in time, would he be able 
to launch himself toward Walters 
and the P-ships — even if the alien 
vessel was already moving away? 
Angrily, he wondered why he had 
not simply broken away from Drew 
and Berryman on the way here and 
used a lock chamber to leave the 
Ship. He had thought about it — 
but had not seriously considered 
doing it. 

There was no shame attached to 
admitting that one was a coward, he 
thought cynically, just as long as 
one did not prove it. 

I nside the blister it was deathly 
quiet. The interference in their 
suit radios was so bad that they had 
116 



to switch off and communicate by 
toudiuig helmets. Hollis’s voice came 
te Mm with a booming, indistinct 
quality about it, but McCullough 
could make it out. 

The physicist said, “I’m assuming 
that for faster-than-light travel all of 
the Ship’s generators must be in bal- 
enced operation, and that one mal- 
functioning generator will cause the 
others to cut out and immobilize 
the vessel. I know enough about the 
power supply lines — which inside 
the blister are not insulated, as you 
can see — to blow this generator. 
But the result might be catastrophic 
for the Ship and would certainly be 
fatal for anyone in the immediate 
vicinity, which is us. 

“So instead of shorting the main 
power supply,” Hollis went on, “I 
propose grounding the • relatively 
much lower control and input bal- 
ancing system — those lopsided, 
figure-of-eight thingummies with the 
blue ceramic end pieces which are, 
I’m fairly sure, somewhat analogous 
to the grid of an old-fashioned ra- 
dio tube. There are one of the things 
attached to every major piece of 
equipment in the blister, and I’ve 
picked out what I think are two of 
the most vital sections of the gen- 
erators. This is what we must 
do ” 

A lopsided, figure-of-eight thirt’- 
gummy, thought McCullough, and 
wondered whatever had become of 
the precise and rarefied language of 
science in which Hollis was usually 
so bewilderingly fluent. He would 
pull the physicist’s leg about it — 
afterward. If there was an oppor- 
tunity afterward. 



IF 




They planned a simultaneous, 
double act of sabotage. The genera- 
tors had been building up to their 
full operating potential for nearly 
twenty minutes; there could not be 
very much time left to do something. 
The visual effects from some of the 
gadgetry around him were becom- 
ing quite flamboyant. As McCul- 
lough crawled toward his assigned 
position, sheets of slow pink light- 
ning curled and rippled silently all 
around him. His spear acquired a 
pale blue corona, and his hair kept 
rising and discharging against the in- 
side of his helmet. Every few yards 
magnetic eddies tugged at his wea- 
pon or the metal parts of his suit, 
seeking to dislodge him from the in- 
sulated catwalk and draw him into a 
premature act of sabotage that would 
certainly kill him and quite possibly 
wreck the whole Ship. 

For reasons which were both sel- 
fish and altruistic McCullough did 
not want that to happen. He wanted 
his own skin and the Ship to suffer 
the minimum of damage. He real- 
ized suddenly that although he was 
terribly afraid for his own immedi- 
ate safety he was furiously angry 
about the things they had done and 
were doing on the Ship. From the 
very beginning they had no control 
of the situation. It had been a stupid 
if well-intentioned muddle. And 
while they had changed their minds 
several times when new data became 
available they had not really used 
their brains. They had been pan- 
icked into things. They had not al- 
lowed themselves time to think. 
And when threatened with danger 
they thought only of survival. 

ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



All things considered, as a samp- 
ling of the species Homo so-called 
Sapiens they had not made a good 
showing. 

Suddenly McCullough was in po- 
sition, looking across at Hollis, who 
was making slow, pushing motions 
with one hand. The physicist was re- 
minding him that they did not have 
to throw the weapons, merely 
launch them slowly and accurately. 
While he watched Hollis held up 
three fingers. The silence was in- 
credible. McCullough was holding 
his breath, but his pulse was thun- 
derous and he could almost hear 
himself sweating. Hollis showed two 
fingers, one finger, then a balled fist. 
McCullough gently launched his 
spear at the target that had been as- 
signed to him. 

The weapon which had once serv- 
ed as part of P-Two’s launcher tube 
was just long enough to make con- 
tact with both the figure-of-eight 
grid and a nearby metal bulkhead, 
and for the first few seconds of its 
travel it looked as if it would do 
so. But then it wobbled suddenly as 
one of the magnetic eddies caught 
it, swinging it off course. One end 
touched the grid, and the other 
swung toward a fat, coppery spiral 
with a bright blue halo flickering 
around it. McCullough gripped the 
catwalk tightly and managed to get 
his eyes closed just in time. 

E ven with the filtering effects of 
tightly closed eyelids the flash 
was blinding. Every nerve in his 
body received a jolt that was neither 
pleasure, pain, pressure, heat or cold 
but was much worse than anything 

117 




he had ever felt before in all his 
life. He stiffened so violently that 
he bounced away from the catwalk. 
He felt something tugging at one 
boot and the fear of being drawn in 
and electrocuted overcame his 
shodced paralysis. He pulled both 
knees up and made frantic swim- 
ming motions in an attempt to get 
away. But the tugging persisted. 
McCullough blinked furiously to dis- 
solve the blotches covering his field 
of vision and saw that Hollis was 
griping his boot and was towing him 
toward the safety of his airlock. 

By the time he was through, his 
eyes were almost back to normal. 
He could see that the interior of the 
generator blister was again dull and 
lifeless. There were no chimes re- 
verberating along the corridors. The 
alien voices were silent. 

With the interference gone, Wal- 
ters was trying to contact them, 
saying that he had seen a flash or 
an explosion and were any of them 
alive. As soon as he had his visor 
iopen Drew began advising him 
strongly to establish a base in the 
adjacent lock chamber with a view 
to discouraging any alien repair 
crew sent to rebuild the sabotaged 
generator. 

But McCullough’s mind was still 
on ah earlier train of thought. Bit- 
terly, he said, “We’re nothing but a 
bunch of stupid, well-intentioned 
bunglers! Surely, as intelligent be- 
ings, we could have evaluated and 
entered a strange situation — even 
an alien stress situation — without 
making it so much worse that . 
that . ” 

He left the sentence dangling, 
118 / 



then went on furiously, “We know 
there are intelligent ^ens on this 
ship. Damnit, we’ve heard them 
talking! To them we must look like 
a race of juvenile delinquents or 
worse. We must get out, leave the 
Ship at once. I’ll request the next 
supply rocket to carry spacesuits 
and food only. With the water sup- 
ply we’ve discovered this will mean 
that we can leave shortly after it ar- 
rives.” 

“And our intelligent,l extra-terres- 
trial crew, what about them?” Hol- 
lis broke in scathingly. “They have 
not shown themselves up to now — 
at least we’re fairly sure they haven’t. 
Why not? Are they in some kind of 
trouble, or are there too few of 
them to risk it? Are we going to 
leave them to do the best they can 
with a Two-infested crij^ed Ship?” 

“We aren’t delinquents and we’re 
not stupid!” Berryman said angrily. 
“If your e-ts are as intelligent as 
you say. Doctor, they will realize 
that everything we did came about as 
a result of the local situation and sci- 
entific curiosity allied to normal 
survival instincts! If they can’t un- 
derstand anything as simple as that 
then they’re stupid, too stupid to 
have built this Ship! But they did 
build it and so .... ” 

“Kill every bloody one of them!” 
yelled Drew. “Wipe the buggers 
out!” 

It was Walters who had the last 
word. Deafeningly, apologetically, 
with his volume of his transmitter 
turned right up he said, “/ will set 
up to re-broadcast your last words 
as the Ship carried you out of the 
Solar System to some dire, extra-ter- 

IF 




restrial fate. This spirited exchange 
of ideas is being overheard by all 
the world. 

“I don’t think the general will 
approve of some of the language . 

XVI 

O n Earth there was only one sub- 
ject which, day by day and 
hour by hour, merited serious dis- 
cussion and that was the War on 
the Ship. 

In this war there were no neu- 
trals and no unaligned powers, even 
though the people who made up the 
nations and even the individual fam- 
ilies were aligned several different 
ways at the same time. Everyone 
knew about the war, of course. 
There were very few who did not 
find it interesting, at least, while 
others found it so all-absorbing and 
exciting that they were quite willing 
to argue and demonstrate and bum 
embassy buildings over it. But the 
majority of people were simply wor- 
ried about the safety of the men on 
the Ship and concerned over the 
many things they seemed to be do- 
ing wrong. 

Everything the men said or did 
was, from someone’s point of view, 
wrong. 

Those scientists who thought of 
their specialties as being “hard” in- 
sisted that more Ship time be de- 
voted to gathering detailed informa- 
tion or structural methods and de- 
sign philosophy, the operating prin- 
ciples and distribution of the vessel’s 
power sources and more, much 
more, data on what everyone so 
loosely referred to as the hyper- 
ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



drive generators and the ship’s cen- 
tral control system. Then the scien- 
tists who were less hard — al- 
though not quite as soft as the Psy- 
chology crowd — wanted more time 
spent in gathering information on 
extra-terrestrial biology and metabo- 
lism, environmental factors and e-t 
life-support systems. They wanted 
autopsies performed on specimens 
other than the Two. But it was the 
psychologists and their equally 
“soft” relatives in sociology and an- 
thropology who seemed to be the 
least demanding and at the same 
time the most positive in their rec- 
ommendations. 

For the psychologists were hav- 
ing a long succession of field days. 
Not only were minor and major 
Ship incidents studied and evaluated 
and discussed at great length, every 
single recorded word and inflexion 
was subjected to a most rigorous 
analysis. So much so that on one oc- 
casion a short, odd-sounding laugh 
from Walters threw one group of 
space medics into a near panic for 
three days until they discovered that 
the high, uneven pitch of the pilot’s 
voice, so suggestive of hysteria and 
imminent crackup, was due to nat- 
ural distortion in the incoming sig- 
nal. 

Despite the dropping of an occa- 
sional brick the psychologist’s pic- 
ture of conditions on the Ship, the 
interaction of the characters in- 
volved, the general emotional and 
moral climate and the unique envi- 
ronmental pressures to which the 
men were being subjected, was rea- 
sonably complete and accurate and 
their recommendations sound. 

119 




At least, the psychologists con- 
sidered them so ... 

'T^he majority of these psychologi- 
cal discussions were broadcast 
on radio and TV, of course, as was 
practically everything pertaining to 
the Ship. But there was one group 
whose recommendations, by their 
very nature, could not be made pub- 
lic — even, and especially, if their 
recommendations were to be adopt- 
ed. 

This group suggested that since 
the emotional situation arising out 
of the environmental conditions on 
the Ship was known in broad out- 
line and the psychological makeup 
of the men currently inhabiting it 
was available in great detail, it 
should he possible to devise certain 
stimuli which would return a large 
measure of control to the Prome- 
theus authorities instead of allowing 
it to remain in the hands and eth- 
ically confused minds of men who 
were too close to their problem to 
have a balanced appreciation of it. 
They insisted that the problem was 
basically one of psychological mal- 
adjustment and was solely their re- 
sponsibility. And as they were the 
people who would have to solve it 
they did not think it fair that they 
should have this responsibility with- 
out also being given a measure of 
control over the situation. 

They also mentioned the fact that 
the position of the Sun with respect 
to Earth and the P-ships would very 
shortly make direct communication 
impossible. Outgoing messages, 
which hitherto had been receivable 
only by the P-ships, as well as ki- 
120 



coming signals would have to be re- 
layed through the Russian circum- 
Venus station. The Russians were 
being very generous with their facil- 
ities. But they would know every 
word that passed in each direction 
and would undoubtedly use the in- 
formation gained to their own ad- 
vantage, to complicate an already 
over-complicated political situation. 
For this reason alone a decision on 
recommendations should be taken as 
soon as possible. 

Then for the younger, less emo- 
tionally mature the Ship had re- 
placed all the variations of Cowboys 
and Indians. Day after day all over 
the world, Walters had his suit 
slashed by the first Two, Colonel 
Morrison met his grisly death and 
McCullough) who was a difficult 
and unsatisfactory character for chil- 
dren \o portray, moved around do- 
ing nothing, apparently, but change 
his mind. 

Between the children and the egg- 
heads lay the tremendous multitude 
who were only moderately adult and 
whose intelligence was average. 
These were the people who listened 
avidly to what they referred to as 
the War News and who greedily ab- 
sorbed every fact and speculation 
that came from the more well in- 
formed commentators on the radio 
and TV — even though many of 
them must have been aware that the 
commentators could not possibly be 
more well informed than their lis- 
teners. 

They watched closely while the 
latest photographs and sketches — 
tidied up and dramatized a little for 
TV presentation — were discussed 

IF 




by panels of scientists from every 
field of knowledge and every degree 
of eminense. They listened to so 
many analyses, theories and predic- 
tions, they were exposed to so many 
different opinions and viewpoints 
and ethical yardsticks in so short a 
space of time, that they were forced 
either to choose sides, or to make up 
their own minds as to what was 
right or wrong or politically expedi- 
ent. 

Some of them reacted by break- 
ing windows and overturning cars, 
or agitated for the Twos to be 
brought under the protection of the 
UNO or the USPAC or started 
funds for sending comforts for the 
troops, well aware of the utterly 
fantastic cost of sending even an 
ounce of comfort to those fifty-mil- 
lion-miles-distant warriors. But there 
were others, not a great number to 
begin with, who went through the 
intensely uncomfortable business of 
thinking for themselves . until the 
realization came that their world had 
changed, that it was no longer the 
world but just a world, with all that 
that implied. 

But this small but rapidly grow- 
ing faction was only one of the 
many pressure groups who felt they 
had a say in the control Prometheus. 

The original idea in making every 
phase of the project open to the 
public had been to arouse interest in 
spaceflight generally and to gain the 
support of the voters for the enor- 
mous cost of the hardware — in 
short, a large-scale PR job. It was a 
noble project which had, unfortun- 
ately, to be paid for by people who 
were not all noble. But now Prome- 



theus had gone sour. Its Ship-side 
personnel seemed to be devolving 
into vicious and sadistic killers, 
while back at home nobility was 
breaking out in some of the most 
unlikely places. 

O n Earth as well as on the Ship, 
Prometheus was getting out of 
control. 

'* . While you were hunting for 
Ship water and hamstringing that 
generator,** General Brady’s voice 
rattled at them, **you had to be rough , 
on the aliens and their equipment. 
We aren*t entirely blaming you for 
this, but we think you are exercis- 
ing far too much initiative. Public 
opinion is hardening against you 
and against Prometheus as a whole, 
even though the majority are still 
being thrilled by the *war* and the 
exploits of their scientists heroes. 
But this is a temporary, unstable, 
even sick, reaction. There is a steady 
growing body of opinion which is 
openly critical of your behavior. It 
accuses you, and through you us, 
of behaving like barbarians! It in- 
sists that you are doing little more 
than looting the Ship of its scien- 
tific booty. 

**This has got to stop!** 

A radio from one of ^e damaged 
suits floated near the outer wall of 
the lock chamber, attached to the 
plating by its antenna lead. The nat- 
ural distortion caused by the helm- 
met phones being overloaded so as 
to act as loudspeakers was increased 
by the anger in General Brady’s 
voice, which carried clearly over 
fifty million miles.

high-acceleration vehicles containing 
food and extra spacesuits only. Un-^ 
til they arrive seven weeks from now 
you will sit tight and do nothing! 
Your only activity will be collecting 
and storing Ship water for the re- 
turn trip. 

*^Establish a base in one of the 
lock chambers close to the P-ships 
and defend it if necessary, but not 
by taking the offensive! Try using 
your ingenuity to avoid killing Twos 
now, and do not molest them or in- 
jure them in any way even if they 
begin repairing the generator! Quite 
a few of us here are far front con- 
vinced that the Two life-form is in 
fact the non-intelligent animal you 
say it is. Exploration of the Ship 
will cease forthwith and you will 
cease trying to experiment with its 
power and control systems. Neither 
will you endanger yourselves, and 
quite possibly the future of our so- 
ciety, by attempting to communi- 
cate with the intelligent aliens who 
may be on the Ship ....** 

Berryman reached out quickly 
and tumW the volume down to a 
whisper. He looked from McCul- 
lough to Drew and Hollis and then 
back again. His smile was all too 
plainly forced as he said, “Consid- 
ering all that the general has just 
said, the action we are contemplat- 
ing is tantamount to mutiny.” 

Hollis said, “I agree.” They both 
looked and sounded frightened, as if 
they were having second thoughts. 

“He doesn’t know what he’s talk- 
ing about,” said Drew angrily. “Ei- 
ther that or he doesn’t believe what 
we’ve told him!” 

122 



And there is a really uncomfort- 
able idea, thought McCoullough, 
then went on quickly, “These or- 
ders are harsh, inflexible and ill- 
considered. In a short time they 
will, like the earlier ones, be amend- 
ed and qualified. We’ll still be for- 
bidden to kill Twos — unless cir- 
cumstances make it absolutely nec- 
essary. Exploration will be allowed 
— within certain limits which will 
not be clearly defined. It will be sug- 
gested that we obtain further data 
on the hyperdrive generators — if 
this can be done without upsetting 
the aliens, or without running too 
great a risk of upsettiog the aliens. 
Gradually the orders will contain so 
many qualifiers we will be back in 
square one, but with our self-confi- 
dence reduced and our tempers 
drastically shortened.” 

Cynically, McCullough went on, 
“Instead of being heroes it seems we 
are to become scapegoats — at least, 
that is the way it looks to me. But 
this means that we will have to be 
allowed some freedom of action. 
Otherwise they would not be able 
to blame us for everything thaf is 
happening.” 

“In other words,” said Drew grim- 
ly, “if we can’t please anyone we 
can at least try to please ourselves.” 

Hollis said doubtfully, “He wasn’t 
at all sympathetic about our trou- 
bles. And it is only three days since 
the colonel died, and he didn’t men- 
tion him at all. But suggesting that 
we will be held responsible for ev- 
erything is going too far, don’t you 
think?” 

“Perhaps,” said McCullough. 
“But you agree that if we are too 

IF 




close to the problem, they are much 
too far away?** 

The three men nodded in turn, 
and suddenly Berryman laughed. He 
said, ’’This must be the first mutiny 
in history where the captain is the 
ringleader I” 

H e broke off. as the quality of 
the whisper coming from the 
phones altered. At McCullough’s 
nod he turned up the vdume again. 

"... And he has no real appre- 
ciation of the harm his anger and 
hostility toward you can cause,** 
said a low, sympathetic, female 
voice. It went on, **ln terms of phys- 
ical distance alone you must feel cut 
off, separated, even rejected hy your 
friends and perhaps even your race. 
In a very real sense you have with- 
drawn from reality, you have lost 
touch with the world and life as it 
should be lived. The psychic dis- 
turbance, the emotional dislocations, 
the constant and cumulative frustra- 
tion of even the simplest natural 
urges — even the act of eating and 
drinking is artificial arid unnatural 
where you are concerned — is more 
than enough without adding the ter- 
rible responsibility of First Contact, 
"/ don*t mean to suggest that any 
of you have reached the point of 
major instability,** she went on 
wa^y, "or that you are not quite 
sane. I do suggest, however, that 
your judgment and reactions are se- 
riously affected by your present sit- 
uation and may no longer be en- 
tirely trustworthy. This is what is 
bothering the general, too, because 
he is being held responsible for ev- 
erything that you people think to 

124 



do, and every minority group in the 
world is trying to pressure him into 
taking fifty mutually exclusive 
courses of action! We all admit he*s 
a genius where astronautics hard- 
ware and logistics are concerned, but 
lefs face it, fellows, he is no psy- 
chologist ..." 

McCullough switched off the ra- 
dio feeling angry and a little fright- 
ened. What idiot had been responsi- 
ble for turning a woman psycholo- 
gist loose on the Prometheus Con- 
trol transmitter? Previously there 
had been no mention whatsoever of 
the mental effects of separation in 
time and space from the world of 
normal existence. When such effects 
had become manifest they had been 
ignored — the P-ship personnel had 
been treated as if they were on an 
extended EVA and their distance 
was five hundred miles from home 
rather than fifty million. 

Emotionally they had been made 
to feel very close to home. Contin- 
uous radio contact plus the knowl- 
edge that practically everyone in the 
world was sharing their experiences 
and feeling concern for them were 
just two of the factors aimed at 
achieving this, and there were prob- 
ably others which only the space 
medics knew about. But whoever 
had allowed a psychologist ignorant 
of these factors, especially such a 
disturbingly female one as this, to 
talk to them and cause them to ques- 
tion their own sanity was either stu- 
pid or criminally irresponsible. 

"Walters is listening,’’ said Mc- 
Cullough. "He can tell us if she 
says anything really important. Right 
now I’d like you to listen to this 

IF 




tape again. 1 have another theory.” 

For several minutes the sounds of 
their dash from the Twos’ enclosure 
to the generator blister filled the 
lock chamber. McCullough asked 
them to pay particular attention to 
the two alien voices. When the play- 
back was complete he said, “In my 
opinion the first voicp is a record- 
ing transmitted in conjunction with 
the warning chimes. Each group of 
word-sounds is identical in tone, 
volume and length of transmissioru 
The second voice is none of these 
things. Its overall tone is different, 
volume and inflexion vary enormous- 
ly; and the message transmitted by 
die first voice is repeated, after a 
fashion, by the second. Perhaps 1 
should say that the message is not 
so much repeated as parodied by the 
second voice. 

“I feel that certain words are re- 
peated too often for it to be an intelli- 
gent communication. It is as if one 
word in a sentence was repeated 
twenty times and sung in different 
keys. Many of the sounds seem to 
be sheer organic noise and sense- 
free — you have heard them. 

“My new theory,” McCullough 
went on, looking at the three men in 
turn, “is supported by all the facts. 
Briefly it is that the alien crew have 
no effective control of their vessel, 
that its operation is almost entirely 
automatic and that the experimental 
animals have overrun the ship. The 
second alien voice belongs to one 
of the crew, or perhaps a descendant 
of the original crew, and it is an in- 
telligent being. However, it is not at 
present a rational being. 

ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



While he had been talking Mc- 
Cullough found that his finger had 
instinctively gone to the suit radio 
switch. There was some vague idea 
in his mind of putting in a full re- 
port to Control and shifting responsi- 
bility by calling Earth for a second 
opinion. But Brady’s opinions would 
not be helpful, McCullough knew 
from short and bitter experience, and 
he himself had insisted many times 
that the people on the Ship were 
better informed on all aspects of the 
situation and should therefore make 
their own decisions. He could have 
Walters send a full report, or even a 
slightly edited report, later. 

Fir^y McCullough took his hand 
and mind off the radio. 

XVII 

J oined by their command module 
airlocks the two P-ships were 
positioned a few yards above the 
generator blister so that Walters 
would be able to detect any attempt 
to repair the human-inflicted dam- 
age. The arrival of an alien repair 
crew was not considered likely, but 
the presence of Walters on watch 
meant that everyone else would be 
gainfully employed inside the Ship 
on what McCullough referred to as 
wide-an^e cultural contact and Drew, 
with more honesty, called an offen- 
sive patrol. 

Their real purpose, no matter 
what they chose to call it or how 
much double-thinking they did 
around it, was to kill Twos. They 
would also hunt down and extermi- 
nate any other alien life-form which 
might prove dangerous to the intelli- 

126 




gent extra-terrestrials on the Ship or 
themselves. 

*Thanks to the doctor we know 
all their vital spots,” Drew said as 
they were preparing to leave their 
hull lock chamber, '*and provided we 
keep cool and pause for the necessary 
instant to take proper aim, killing 
the beasts will be relatively easy. But 
we should not take on more th^ one 
of them at a time unless we have 
the advantage of a solid defensive 
position. This isn’t very sporting 
since there are four of us, but we 
cannot afford casualities.” 

McCullough was listening to Drew 
but thinking about Walters. One did 
not have to be a psychologist to 
know that the pilot was close to the 
breaking point. Even though he was 
in the least physical danger of all, 
Walters was in one respect absorbing 
more punishment than any of them. 
Prometheus Control, General Brady 
and assorted space medical people 
were continually hammering at him, 
he being the only member of the ex- 
pedition they could talk to with any 
chance of getting an immediate reply. 
And because he was the only one 
available, Brady was being much 
tougher on Walters than the situation 
really warranted. The general was try- 
ing to get through to McCullough 
and the others, but all the anger and 
recriminations and outright threats 
sounded as if they were being direct- 
ed at Walters alone. 

. McCullough no longer communi- 
cated direct with the general — he 
was usually too busy in the Ship and 
Walters was in a position to pass on 
any new or constructive suggestions if 
there were any. This was, he knew. 



very unfair to the pilot since he 
frequently had to wait days for the 
chance to do so, days during which 
he could never be sure whether the 
other men in the ship were alive or 
dead. When, at the conclusion of a 
particularly bad session with Brady, 
one of the cosmonauts on the circum- 
Venus station, which was now relay- 
ing all transmissions added a few 
words wishing him luck, Walters’s 
reaction was both revealing and quite 
unexpected in a grown man. 

The pilot needed company. Mc- 
Cullough or Hollis, the only two who 
had operational spacesuits, should 
have visited him more often. But 
somehow there was never time. Some- 
thing was always happening in the 
Ship .... 

The doctor became aware sudden- 
ly that the lock entrance was open 
and Drew was beside it, saying . 
And remember, this is not a game. 
If anyone feels like treating it as one 
they should remind themselves that 
the nearest hospital is sixty million 
miles away.” 

O n the way to the animal enclo- 
sure they encountered — singly 
— three of the tentacled aliens and 
killed them. Since it was now 
generally accepted that the Twos were 
non-intelligent lab animals the job 
had been performed with efficiency 
and, McCullough noted, quite a 
lot of enthusiasm. Drew had noticed 
it, too, and he kept repeating his 
warnings about thinking of the opera- 
tion as a game until they reached 
the cages, and would probably have 
continued if McCullough had not cut 
him short. 



126 



IF 




“I agree with Drew,” he said firm- 
ly. “We must be entirely cold-blood- 
ed about this. But before we put our 
plan into effect I would like to gain 
a better idea of their physical capa- 
bilities. To begin with, how did they 
break out?” 

It was between meal-times for the 
e-ts so they had a chance to search 
the area thoroughly. 

The animals* quarters occupied a 
cylindrical volume of space roughly 
eighty yards in length and twenty in 
diameter. It was divided into pens of 
various sizes by heavy wire mesh 
stretched between a framework of 
tubing, so that the caged animals 
were always in sight of anyone in 
the four personnel corridors which 
ran fore and aft along the sides of 
the enclosure. 

It seemed that the food and water 
dispensers also differed in size and 
complexity and were fitted to the 
common wall between two cages so 
as to serve both. Some of the cages 
were still occupied by drifting, desic- 
cated carcasses whose edible parts 
were missing. 

From the condition of the bodies, 
the damage to large areas of the re- 
straining mesh and the condition of 
the food dispensers, they were able 
to obtain a fairly good idea of what 
had happened. 

One or more of the dispensers had 
failed. Whether the failure was due to 
a design fault or the rough eating 
habits of the animals concerned was 
impossible to say. But the result was 
an attack on the wire mesh, a success- 
ful attack in most cases, which had 
forced an opening into the operating 
dispensers in adjacent cages or into 



enclosures containing smaller edible 
Kfe-forms. The transfer of animals 
between cages had so increased the 
demand on the remaining dispensers 
that they, too, had broken down un- 
til only a few machines were still 
operating. An attempt had been 
made to control the mass breakout 
by electrification of sections of the 
wire mesh, but this had been a hasty, 
jury-rigged installation which had al- 
so totally broken down in several 
places. 

Judging by the condition of the 
bodies, the majority of the other ani- 
mals had been unable to defend 
themselves against the terrible horn 
and tentacles of the Twos, although 
a small number must have escaped 
through gaps tom in the mesh. Other- 
wise there would have been only one 
species infesting the Ship. But there 
was one large, caterpiUar-like animal 
who had never had a chance. All Mc- 
Cullough could tell from its remains 
was that it had no skeleton to speak 
of, its body being surrounded by 
great bands of muscle. Its head sec- 
tion, which was heavily boned, con- 
tained four manipulators or feelers 
of some kind in addition to the 
usual sensory equipment. Its hide 
was pale gray and very smooth, like 
that of a walrus. 

In a nearby enclosure, however, 
the Twos had met sometlung which 
even they could not stand against. 
For a long time McCullough and the 
others stared at the drifting Two 
carcasses, stripped of all edible tissue 
so that little more than the bony 
carapace remained, and at the cluster 
of tiny holes punched through the 
half-inch thick shell.

t was Berryman who spoke first. 
“And now,” he said gravely, “we 
are looking for an emotionally dis- 
turbed alien with a machine- 
gun . 

But they all had far too much to 
do before the Twos began arriving 
for lunch to give this new develop- 
ment the discussion it deserved. 

The first step was to disconnect the 
wiring from the electrified sections of 
mesh — during a battle with the 
Twos would not be a good time to be 
accidentally electrocuted. Then from 
the small or more damaged food dis- 
pensers they stripped lengths of ca- 
ble and metal piping and threaded 
these into the tom sections of mesh, 
repairing and reinforcing their cage’s 
sides and barring its severely warped 
doors. They did not make any pro- 
vision for evacuation if their plan 
went wrong, although it was obvious 
that they were all thinking about it 
while they worked and talked loudly 
about the probable effects of shutting 
off the Ship’s animals from what 
must be the only source of food and 
water. 

All the other dispensers had been 
wrecked, accidentally by the Twos 
or deliberately by the men. 

“Poisoning them would be safer,” 
said Berryman when their cage had 
been made as secure as possible, “if 
we knew what was toxic to them. 
And if we had some of it.” 

“Too slow,” said McCullough. 

“Six inches of cold aluminum al- 
loy,” said Drew, “is toxic to every- 
thing.” 

“Company,” said Hollis. 

Three of the tentacled e-ts and a 
pair of the white-furred flying car- 



pets had arrived and were heading 
toward their cage. It became a civil 
war almost at once. 

As soon as the furry Type Three 
came within striking distance a Two 
lashed out with its tentacle, the bony 
tip ripping a six-inch gash in the 
white fur. While the Three flapped 
helplessly in the center of the corridor 
the Two steadied itself against the 
mesh and launched a second and 
more deadly attack, this time criss- 
crossing the pelt with deep and visib- 
ly widening channels which oozed 
bright red. The Three began to un- 
dulate rapidly imtil it was fluttering 
like a thick, bloody flag in a high 
wind. Then sudderdy it was just a 
tattered, lifeless rag; and its attacker, 
a very messy eater, began to feed. 

Meanwhile the second Two was 
not having things all its own way. 
Somehow the furry animal had man- 
aged both to evade its attacker’s ten- 
tacles and to attach itself to the Two’s 
unprotected back where those four 
deadly weapons could not be brought 
to bear. At first McCullough thought 
he was seeing the e-t version of the 
old adage about holding a tiger by 
the tail, but then he saw that the 
furry body of the Three was squeez- 
ing down and between the roots of 
the threshing tentacles where the 
Two’s eyes were situated, blinding 
it, and then extending further onto 
and across the underbelly until it 
blocked the breathing apertures. 

When the Two was dead the furry 
animal did not try to eat it, but in- 
stead undulated over to the mesh. 
Possibly it was a vegetarian. 

During the fight the unoccupied 
Two had attacked the mesh, probing 



128 



IF 




and worrying and slapping at it with 
horn and tentacles, then bouncing 
back to the corridor wall net to hurl 
itself carapace first like a living can- 
nonball against the wire. McCul- 
lough had wondered how the ani- 
mals had been able to break out of 
their cages in the first place, since 
the security arrangements had seem- 
ed adequate for such a relatively 
small life-form, but as the mesh 
twanged and bulged inward under 
the onslaught of this single, angry 
specimen he was no longer puzzled. 
Finally the Two, tired of beating its 
head against the mesh, insinuated 
couple of feet of one of its tentacles 
in an attempt to pull the wire apart. 

Immediately Drew gripped the 
tentacle, planted both feet firmly 
against the mesh and pulled the Two 
hard against the wire while the spear 
in his other hand drove forward in 
a single, twisting, lethal stab. The 
beast’s tentacles thrashed briefly and 
were still, then there was anothet 
Two charging the mesh, and an- 
other. 

T he dispenser began making soft, 
chuffing sounds. It emitted a 
slow, untidy jet of water from a 
spigot, which had had its teat chewed 
off, and a series of gray round ob- 
jects of the size and shape of a large 
orange. They had the consistency of 
porridge, Berryman reported when 
one of them hit the side of his head, 
and added that the smell and taste — 
it had splattered forward onto his 
nose and lips — were not entirely 
unpleasant. 

They became too busy to talk 
shortly after that, and the job of 



killing Twos was not as easy as Drew 
had made it appear. 

They were badly hampered by 
. weightlessness, which forced them 
either to hold onto a Two or to twist 
their feet through the mesh to use 
their spears effectively. But very often 
the Twos presented far too many 
tentacles, and anchoring themselves 
by twisting a foot into the mesh was 
asking to have it smashed by the 
hard tip of a tentacle or impaled on 
a horn. Without some form of sup- 
port their aim suffered and most of 
the force behind their thrusts was 
expended on getting through the 
mesh, so that what little remained 
was enough only to push the Twos 
away and inflict superficial injuries 
if any. The reaction from such a 
lunge sent the men spinning helpless- 
ly so that they were in as much dan- 
ger from the spears of their friends 
as from the horns of the Twos. 

*This is a stupid plan,” gasped 
McCullough as he knocked away a 
spear which was coming at his face. 

“Since it was your plan,” said 
Berryman from the other side of the 
cage, “I must decline to comment.” 

“Hold still, everyone,” said Drew. 
“I want to try something . .” 

During the few minutes pause 
while he explained and demonstrated 
his idea the mesh, particularly the 
places which had been patched and 
reinforced, took a savage beating. 
Reinforcing cable stretched and 
snapped, lengths of piping buckled 
and^egan slipping out of position and 
it would be only a matter of time be- 
fore the Twos were inside the cage 
with them. 

Following Drew’s instructions they 



ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



129 




launched themselves like ungainly 
swordfish from the panel of the dis- 
penser, arms extendi stiffly before 
them and hands gripping their wea- 
pons. They jumped in unison so as 
to minimize the danger of spearing 
each other, the idea being to aim 
themselves in the general direction 
of their target and at the last 
moment guide the tip of their spears 
through the mesh. The creatures pos- 
sessed enough weight and inertia not 
to be pushed away before a deep 
wound was inflicted and, since the 
combined length of arms and spear 
was much greater than that of the 
e-t’s horn or tentacles, there would 
be little danger of retaliation. 

It worked. 

After the first few abortive at- 
tempts it became a drill. They each 
chose a target, kicked themselves 
away from the food dispenser cabinet, 
and the three targets died. But there 
were always more to take their places, 
squeezing tentacles through the wire, 
jabbing with that long, obscene horn 
and gobbling like frantic turkeys. For 
McCullough it became a continuing 
nightmare of killing the same Two 
over and over again. He had lost 
count of the times they had launch- 
ed themselves from the dispenser, 
now slippery with a scummy mixture 
of food, water and e-t blood, to dive 
through air that was like a thick 
soup of the same recipe, to kill that 
Two once again. 

A number of the white-furred 
Threes had squeezed between the 
Twos and were clinging to the wire 
and absorbing — McCullough could 
not see exactly how — the streamers 
and gobbets of water and food drift- 



ing toward them* There were even 
two of them inside the cage, having 
wriggled through a loosened patch, 
flapping and undulating throu^ the 
air like great furry stingrays. All the 
men had been careful not to kill the 
type Three aliens. After seeing how 
one of them had dealt with a Two, 
they considered them allies rather 
than enemies. As well, not killing 
them introduced a certain amount of 
discrimination into the exercise so 
that they could think of it as being 
something less than a brutal, bloody 
massacre. 

Ti yTcCuUough tried to think of other 
-LVl things; the slaughter proceeded. 

Between meal times the animal 
enclosure had been surprisingly clean, 
so that the dispenser cabinet must 
also fulfill the duty of a waste- 
disposal unit. But while the waste 
water and food would no doubt be 
reprocessed, the material which 
could not be reclaimed would be 
pumped to the outer hull and dis- 
posed of, which meant that the 
plumbing associated with the waste- 
disposal system would be metal pip- 
ing which, because it did not have to 
carry an electrical current, would not 
have to be insulated at any point 
between the dispenser and the hull 
outlet. As soon as this was all over 
they would be able to hook onto it 
with antennae and contact Walters. 

He felt rather pleased with him- 
self for being able to reason things 
out like this while engaged in the 
not quite routine job of killing 
Twos. Then suddenly there were no 
more targets. The still-living Twos 
were retreating along the corridors.

IF 




dragging the bodies of their dead 
friends with them when they could 
so that they would not go hungry, 
and the dispenser, which had ceased 
producing half an hour since, went 
dramatically into reverse. 

Heavy protective panels slid aside 
to reveai large openings covered with 
safety grills. Drifting food, water and 
other debris moved toward the open- 
ings, picking up speed as they went. 
So great was the force of suction 
that the air made a high-pitched 
whistle as it went through the grill 
and within a few minutes the cage 
was clear. But there was more to 
come. From the eight corners of the 
enclosure a thin, foaming, sharp- 
smelling liquid spurted out immedi- 
ately followed by eight high-pressure 
sprays of water. By the time the dis- 
penser had shut itself off the men 
and the two furry Threes inside the 
cage were like the air, clean, fresh 
and slightly damp. 

Outside the cage dead Twos 
drifted and spun slowly, stiff-ten- 
tacled, like fossilized starfish; Above, 
below and all aroxmd them the mesh 
was thick with them, as if it was 
some kind of alien flypaper which 
had not been changed for' too long 
a time. 

Berryman linked his antenna to 
the dispenser plumbing and made 
contact with Walters. He tried to 
speak but obviously could not get 
a word in edgewise. Watching, Mc- 
Cullough saw him close his eyes 
tightly as if there was something he 
did not want to see, something much 
worse than the ghastly spectacle all 
around them. Finally he spoke. 

“We’re in trouble,” he said dully. 



“Walters is . upset. Brady has 
been working on him again, and 
that girl. She sounds like a nice girl, ho 
says, but she confuses him. The 
first supply rocket is off course. 
She didn’t actually tell him that we 
were bad boys and if we didn’t start 
doing as we were told again the 
other two might miss as well. It was 
just that public opinion was touchy, 
and it was difficult to make promises 
when the men at the Ship kept 
messing things up. He says she men- 
tioned some very person^ stuff, ma- 
terial he never expected to hear men- 
tioned, privileged information. He’s 
thinking of all the people who have 
heard everything she said — the 
men on the Venus station and all 
their people in Russia. Everybody 
will soon know. He’s very unhappy 
about it.” 

Berryman stopped and took a 
deep breath. Fatigue and tension 
made it into a tremendous, ludicrous 
yawn, but nobody laughed. He went 
on, “So he blabbed everything to 
Bardy. Your new theory, our plans, 
everjrthing. He says he couldn’t help 
it. He says he wants to be a good 
boy again so’s they’ll let him go 
home . .”

F or three days they barricaded 
themselves inside the dispenser 
cage during mealtimes and killed 
Twos. As expected, the number of 
e-t casualties duninished sharply 
each day. This was, of course, due 
to the fact of there being ample 
food available outside the cage in the 
form of previously slain animals.

On the fourth day they tried a differ- 
ent approach* 

i A series of food caches were built 
up in compartments opening off the 
conidors leading from the enclosure 
to one of the hull airlocks. By this 
time they had discovered how to 
turn off the food dispensers at will 
and they had towed the dead e-ts 
to the nearest lock and dumped them 
into space, so that the Twos which 
remained in the Ship were becoming 
very hungry. 

The operation of placing a trail 
of food between the enclosure and 
the lock chamber, during the few 
minutes before mealtimes when it 
would have its maximum effect, was 
a dangerous one but well worth the 
risks. The end result was a lock 
chamber crowded with Twos fighting 
over a small food cache so fiercely 
that they were usually oblivious of 
the fact that they had suddenly been 
sealed in and Hollis or McCullough 
were outside the hull opening the 
compartment to space. 

They bagged as many as six Twos 
at a time that way. 

On the ninth day McCullough de- 
eded that their original purpose of 
drastically reducing the numbers of 
Twos roaming the Ship had been 
accomplished and they could all re- 
turn to more constructive forms of 
activity. 

The decision on what to do about 
Walters was not so easily taken, and 
McCullough could not put off mak- 
ing it any longer. 

Punishment or retribution of any 
kind was ruled out, of course, since 
that would involve varying degrees 
of criticism or rejection by his 



friends. Alone as he had been on the 
P-ship for weeks on end, the pilot 
was particularly sensitive to this form 
of punishment and he had already 
soaked up more than enough of it 
from General Brady. Dirty fitting 
and psychological warfare, so far as 
McCullough was concerned, were 
becoming synonymous. 

“I should have come to see you 
sooner,” he told Walters as he open- 
ed his visor after passing through 
the inner seal. He waved vaguely 
toward the port and the frigid, de- 
compressed Twos drifting outside 
and added, “we were very busy.” 

“Yes,” said the pilot, smiling. “I 
took some very good pictures of the 
spring cleaning.” 

Walters’s voice was quiet and 
pleasant, his features relaxed and his 
hands and fingers yellow and blood- 
less so tightly was he gripping the 
sides of his couch. 

Awkwardly, McCullough said, “I 
won’t say that we don’t blame you, 
not again. Telling the truth^too often 
can make it sound like a lie. And, 
well, don’t worry if it happens to 
you again. You are aware of what 
they are trying to do to you so it 
won’t be so easy for them next time, 
and they might even change their 
approach — ” 

“They have,” said Walters. “Just 
before you arrived that girl told me 
they would not divert the other sup- 
ply rockets no matter what fool 
stunt we pulled or how much trou- 
ble we caused them. Obviously this 
news is supposed to make us aU 
break down and weep out of sheer 
gratitude that mamma still loves us 
even when we’ve been naughty. 



132 



IF 




“I wish I hadn’t read so many 
psychology books,” he ended bitterly. 
“It has made me cynical.” 

McCullough laughed. He said, 
“Cynicism is a very good defense, al- 
so a little sympathy for the enemy 
— Brady, that is, not the Twos. And 
a good, hefty shot of megalomania 
might help as well. You start by 
doubting everything they tell you 
and questioning all their motives, 
at the same time trying to appreci- 
ate the general’s position, but not to 
the extent that you fail to realize 
the true importance of the part we 
have to play in all this. So you doubt 
Brady, you feel sorry for him and, 
in your quiet, respectful fashion, you 
also feel superior to him. Get the 
idea?” 

“Of late,” said Walters doubtful- 
ly, “I have become much less quiet 
and respectful.” 

“That is because you haven’t been 
feeling superior enough,” said Mc- 
Cullough drily. He went on, “We 
are the ' experts in this particular 
situation. It is ridiculous to expect 
us to obey people who know less 
about it than we do — people who, 
if they were to regain complete 
control over us, are under so much 
pressure from so many different di- 
rections that they are incapable of 
giving proper orders anyway.” 

Ti TcCullough waited then, without 
iVl appearing to wait, wondering 
if the pilot would seize the bait or 
even if he was aware of it. He was 
and he did. 

“You mentioned them regaining 
complete control over us,” said Wal- 
ters quickly. “Other than the control. 



which is as you know far from com- 
plete, imposed by service discipline 
and the habit of obedience, how 
can they influence us?” 

“This is rather awkward for me,” 
said McCullough, preparing to slide 
imperceptibly from questionable, 
rule-of-thumb psychology into out- 
right fiction, “because I didn’t want 
to talk about this until I was surer 
of my facts. But it seems to me that 
we may have been the subjects of 
a form of conditioning which was 
designed to support and guide us as 
well as furnishing Prometheus with 
a large measure of control. By this I 
mean that it was subtle enough not 
to interfere with mentation and at 
the same time leave us unaware that 
we were being helped and controlled. 
How exactly this conditioning was 
implanted I don’t know, although I 
suspect that the hours we spent list- 
ening to canned lectures in the simu- 
lator may have had something to do 
with it, but the method used to rein- 
force the conditioning and at the 
same time control us is. I’m fairly 
sure, the radio transmissions from 
the Cape. 

“The mechanics of the process,” 
McCullough went on seriously, 
“might involve the use of certain key 
words and phrases but would, I’m 
pretty sure, be more likely to depend 
on the tond quality of voice used — 
they could heterodyne their AF with 
sub- or ultra-sonics to obtain a kind 
of subliminal effect on the audio fre- 
quency. But for various reasons the 
conditioning broke down or was con- 
siderably weakened and they lost a 
large measure of their control over 
us.”

133 




Natural radio interference with the 
signal could have been one factor, 
McCullough went on to explain, and 
the constant relaying of transmissions 
through the suit radios had probably 
attenuated the effect even more. It 
was not surprising, therefore, that 
the men who had Control’s orders re- 
layed to them from the P-ship had 
been able to exercise discretion in 
the matter of obeying orders while 
Walters, who was in direct radio con- 
tact, had never had a chance of re- 
sisting them. 

“That makes me feel much bet- 
ter,” said the pilot when McCul- 
lough had finished talking. “It even 
gives me an excuse for future mis- 
demeanors, if any. But surely 
Brady’s psychological weapon is two- 
edged. It caused to be made public 
information which he would have 
preferred to remain secret, namely 
the extermination — massacre, he 
calls it — of the Twos. Rather than 
risk the chance of the listening world 
hearing something even more un- 
pleasant, he might leave me alond.” 

“I doubt it,” said McCullough. 

“But if he goes on,” said Walters 
angrily, “it means he is pushing a 
psychological abort button! He will be 
softening us up until, instead of be- 
ing able to think and carry out com- 
plex technical activities, we’ll be just 
so many jellies unable to think or act 
at all much less obey orders. Is he 
trying to wreck the Project? Isn’t it 
also possible that he could push a 
button and ignite our return fuel 
supply? Was provision made for this 
in case the e-ts turned out to be 
baddies and threatened the security 
of the world? 



“All of a sudden I don’t trust 
Brady, and I dislike being treated like 
part of the hardware.” 

He broke off as he became aware 
of McCullough’s expression, then 
said quickly, “I don’t really believe 
any of that, but there is an easy 
way to deal with the possibilility. 
Next time we’re in contact I’ll tell 
the listening world that if there is 
an unexplained explosion out here it 
will have been caused by Brady.” 
He laughed suddenly. “But your real 
danger is me! With this information 
and all the spare time at my disposal 
I might analyze and reproduce this 
conditioning effect. My word would 
be law then, and I could wrap you 
all around my little finger!” 

“As I said,” McCuUougih smiled 
as he turned to go, “a little mega- 
lomania is a good thing.” 

O n the way back to the Ship, Mc- 
Cullough found himself ques- 
tioning some of his own motives. He 
had been telling lies to the pilot, sug- 
gesting that Walters had not been 
really responsible for his apparent 
treachery by blaming everything on a 
form of conditioning which might not 
even be workable, but not solely as 
an act of kindness. McCullough him- 
self needed support and reassurance. 
He wanted as many people on his 
side as possible, which meant that 
he could not risk Walters going over 
to Brady. If the pilot sided actively 
with Control instead of the men in 
the Ship, McCullough could not bear 
to think of the consequences. In the 
frighteningly simple world of emo- 
tional relationships and physical sur- 
vival, Walters’s friendship could only 

II! 



134 




be assured if he was to become com- 
pletely and utterly hostile to the gen- 
eral. 

And so McCullough himself was 
guilty of pressing psychological push- 
buttons and treating a human being as 
part of the hardware. Worse, he was 
pressing them without fully under- 
standing what he was doing or what 
the end result might be. Worst of all 
was the fact that what he was doing 
did not trouble McCullough’s con- 
science as much or as often as it 
should. 

His conscience seemed to be de- 
veloping thick and widespread cal- 
louses. He wondered how long it 
would be before he becanoe com- 
pletely de-civilized. 

Progress within the Ship during 
the next few days was erratic. Berry- 
man came out in a livid, itching rash 
which lasted for one whole day and 
caused McCullough to have horrible 
visions of everyone going down with 
the e-t equivalent of bubonic plague 
carried by dead Twos, before it faded 
completely. It was only then that 
Hollis, Drew and Berryman admitted 
smugly to eating a few ounces of 
alien porridge every day for the past 
week. McCullough warned them of 
the possibility of dangerous long- 
term cumulative effects — the fact 
that Berryman’s allergy symptoms 
had cleared up in so short a time 
did not necessarily mean that the 
food was completely non-toxic. But 
then McCullough realized that he 
was beginning to sound like General 
Brady and that the three men were 
expecting compliments instead of criti- 
cism, so he added gravely that the 
cumulative effect of the toxine would 



probably take the form of a long, 
wasting, ultimately fatal disease in- 
distinguishable from old age. 

Spurred on by this act of moral 
cowardice they immediately an- 
nounced plans for domesticating the 
Threes. • 

T hey did it by first using the por- 
ridge to gain their trust, punish- 
ment to teach them not to wrap their 
furry bodies around a human being’s 
head — although there was no real 
danger here as they could be peeled 
off easily with human fingers, and 
the punishment was very light — and 
petting, particularly when it took the 
form of combing their fur with stif- 
fened fingers. Several of the Threes 
became attached, literally, to Berry- 
man and Drew, and Hollis and Mc- 
Cullough began picking out Threes 
and trying to make friends with them. 

Their fur was pleasant to touch 
and they seemed very friendly and 
demonstrative — just like dogs, in 
fact. McCullough suspected that, like 
dogs, the scratching gave them 
pleasure because it helped dislodge 
parasites, and he began to wonder 
about the habits of alien fleas. Also 
like dogs they were useful as well as 
friendly. They could sense Twos at 
a distance, and this early warning 
system saved lives many times over. 

Despite the three successful opera- 
tions in the enclosure and the subse- 
quent strategy which had lured a 
large number of the beasts into lock 
chambers and the vacuum of space, 
their movements within the Ship were 
still being badly hampered by Twos. 

Mean, vicious and very himgry 
Twos.

By following the supply ducting 
back from the food dispensers they 
had found the compartment — 
whose doors, fortunately, had re- 
mained Two-proof — where the food 
was* processed for distribution to the 
various cages. Their first act had 
been to shut off the food supply, 
which had been accomplished with 
very little damage to processing 
equipment, with the idea of forcing 
the remaining Twos to kill each other 
off for food. But this had turned 
out to be a very slow business and, 
while they occasionally came on an 
animal which had been killed and 
eaten by its own species, there were 
indications that the surviving Twos — 
their numbers were estimated at not 
over twenty — preferred human be- 
ings as food. 

The investigation was proceeding, 
McCullough told himself, but an un- 
biased, hypothetical observer would 
have said that the humans were being 
hunted all over the Ship. 

XIX 

T hey investigated, or were forced 
to take cover near, the area of 
the Power Room. This was the com- 
partment where all the heavy power 
cables for the generators and the 
Ship lighting supplies had their origin, 
and they spent two days in the area 
without being able to find a way in. 
So far as they could see the com- 
partment was heavily shielded and 
sealed tightly against all intruders, in- 
cluding members of the Ship’s crew. 

As the work of charting the ves- 
sel’s interior continued, other blank 
areas appeared, compartments which 



were completely sealed off against 
everyone and everything. 

‘‘Like it says in my car instruction 
booklet,” said Hollis, trying manfully 
to hide his disappointment, ‘‘repair or 
maintenance should be handled only 
by a qualified mechanic or service 
station . .” 

One of the compartments which 
they entered easily contained large 
quantities of food and liquids other 
than water in what was obviously 
weightless packaging. This time it was 
the Threes rather than the men who 
acted, quite happily, as guinea-pigs 
— McCullough wanted to dispell a 
lingering doubt which was troubling 
him that the containers might hold 
paint instead of soup. But it was the 
labelling system used to identify the 
containers which caused most of the 
discussion. 

It was Hollis who tried finally to 
sum up. 

‘‘We agree that the line of charac- 
ters overprinted on the label is some 
kind of service routing and identifi- 
cation code or serial number. We 
think it is a number rather than a 
word because of the repetition of 
certain characters and because sim- 
ilar combinations were found on Ship 
sub-assemblies and structural de- 
tails. Markings incorporated in the 
label itself, which are similar to those 
found near airlock controls and ser- 
vice panels, are words identifying 
its contents with possibly the ad- 
dition of some purely advertising ma- 
terial. The pictorial content of some 
of the labels are confusing, but then 
an illustration of a slice of bacon 
would not give an alien very much 
information about a pig. We must 



136 



IF 




assume that the containers hold some 
kind of edible animal or vegetable 
tissue, although their is a faint pos- 
sibility that — ” 

“ — the labels,” Berryman said, 
grinning, “may carry a picture of the 
chef.” 

Hollis ignored him and continued, 
“The fact that the whole compart- 
ment is below-average Ship* tempera- 
ture, and that many of the storage 
cabinets are additionally refrigerated, 
supports the food theory. But the part 
which puzzles me is the” picture of the 
Three on the door of that big re- 
frigerated cabinet, and the tools or 
eating utensils and assorted collec- 
tion of small packages inside it which . 
also carry picture of a Three. Is 
the Three, or certain parts of it, 
perhaps, some kind of delicacy?” 

Drew shook his head. He said, 
“In our house we didn’t keep the 
caviar in the cutlery drawer.” 

McCullough had been thinking 
hard while the physicist had been 
talking. He said suddenly, “The 
delicacies are too small, some of them, 
and too carefully wrapped to be 
food, I think, and the utensils are 
very sharp and their packaging also 
bears the emblem of a somewhat 
stylized Three. To me this suggests 
. well, what animal do you asso- 
ciate with medicine and errands of 
mercy?” 

Hollis said, “A red — but no, 
that isn’t an animal. A snake! The 
staff and coiled serpents of Aescule- 
pius. Or ... or do you mean a St. 
Bernard?” 

McCullough nodded and Berryman 
began stroking the Three which was 
wrapped around his hips and thighs 



“Nice doggie,” he said happily. 

B ut the great majority of the com- 
partments they examined were 
puzzling without being informative. 
They were large compartments con- 
taining eight, twelve and sometimes 
sixteen big, hollow cylinders of some 
kind of plastic material supported 
along the center of the room by taut 
but flexible cables. The cylinders were 
just over three yards in length and 
were encircled at intervals of a foot 
or so by wide, flexible bands of rub- 
bery materials which compressed the 
soft, hollow tube and made if look 
a little like a caterpillar. The ma- 
terial of the cylinder was thickly 
padded on the inside. 

The compartments were fitted with 
lighting fixtures, cabinets and various 
enigmatic items whose general design 
and coloring were less ultilitarian 
than anything previously met with 
in the Ship. Invariably, one of the 
cabinets bore the picture of a stylized 
Three on its door, and in some of 
them the contents showed signs of 
having been used. In some of the 
compartments there were pictures on 
the walls — large, fuzzy pictures 
which seemed to show trees growing 
horizontally with branches doubling 
as extra roots, or things which look- 
ed like heaps of varicolored spaghet- 
ti, or illustrations, sometimes covering 
most of the wall, of something re- 
sembling marble or coarse-grained 
wood. 

Sometimes a thorough search of 
these compartments brought to light 
mislaid or discarded books, diagrams 
and photographs. None of the books 
were illustrated; the diagrams were 



ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



137 




purely technical; and the photographs 
were even more confusing since they 
pictured things or people or events 
which were completely alien. 

“I wish,” said Hollis bitterly as he 
turned one of the photographs, play- 
ing cards or beer mats over and over 
in a vain attempt to find a viewpoint 
which made sense, “that they had 
been a little more untidy. You can 
find out an awful lot about a person 
from the contents of his wastepaper 
basket.” 

“If these cylinders are some kind 
of tubular hammock,” said Berry- 
man to McCullough, “and I don't 
sec what else they can be, the only 
e-t they will fit is that big caterpillar 
we found half-eaten in the animsd en- 
closure. But what really bothers me 
is the number of these dormitory 
compartments and the number of 
hammocks in each one. What was 
this ship? A troop transport? Some 
kind of colonization project which 
went wrong?” 

“Maybe a big ship needs a crew 
to match,” Drew put in quickly. “But 
where the blazes are they?” 

McCullough shook his head. He 
said, “My theory is that it was, and 
is, a very small crew. If there had 
been a large number of them when 
the Twos broke out, we would have 
found traces of them — carcasses, 
bones, unedible remnants. How that 
particular caterpillar happened to be 
in that cage I don’t know, but — ” 

“Suppose it wasn’t intelligent,” 
Hollis broke in, “but a species phy- 
sically resembling the intelligent e-t 
life-form. Before we sent a man into 
space we tested apes and monkeys 
because their metabolism and — ” 



“For God's sake,” said McCul- 
lough irritably, “the situation is com- 
plicated enough as it is! My idea is 
this. The dormitories were used by 
the people who built the Ship, who 
left when the job was finished. Pos- 
sibly the compartments will be used 
for colonists or passengers on a later 
trip, but not this time. This trip 
the Ship was, is, on her maiden voy- 
age.” 

“And since control seems to be 
largely automatic,” Berryman added, 
“the crew could be very small in- 
deed. 

“I want you all to listen to this 
tape,” he said, then added apologeti- 
cally, “again.” 

T hey listened again to the gobbling 
of Twos in the enclosure, the 
chiming and moaning and the two 
alien voices. Like the Twos they 
could disregard one of the voices and 
its accompanying chimes since this 
was almost certainly some kind of 
pre-takeoff recorded warning se- 
quence. The moaning could have 
been caused by machinery, perhaps 
malfunctioning equipment of some 
kind, except that no machine should 
ever make a noise like that. Hollis and 
Berryman suggested that it might be 
music of some kind being played in 
the second voice’s quarters. The 
sound could have been made by a 
number of wind instruments, but the 
tonal range and scale were crazy. 

So, in all probability, was the 
alien. 

“I’m beginning to think there is 
only one intelligent e-t left on the 
Ship,” McCullough said as they pre- 
pared to leave the compartment, “and 



138 



IF 




that one is in very poor shape phy- 
sically and mentally. But to help it 
we need more information about its 
world and its society, its relations with 
its fellows or with members of the 
opposite sex or sexes if there are 
more than two, and as much data as 
we can possibly obtain on its own 
personal background. Somewhere in 
the Ship there must be family photo- 
graphs . .” 

“Psycho-therapy is a chancy busi- 
ness,” said Berryman quietly, “even 
with human beings. Trying it on an 
emotionally disturbed alien seems . • 

“Foolhardy,” said Hollis. 

Drew did not say anything. Since 
the time McCullough had revived him 
with the Kiss of Life he had never 
disagreed with the doctor. But oc- 
casionally, as now, his face became 
more than usually expressionless. 

To make successful contact with 
it, McCullough told himself firmly, 
they would have to see that it was 
capable of rational behavior and show 
that they themselves were friendly 
towards it. Clearing the Ship of the 
majority of its Twos should prove 
their good intentions, but only if 
the being' was sane enough to ap- 
preciate and understand what they 
were doing. And it possessed, or had 
possessed, a weapon. Why then did it 
not come out of hiding and help 
them exterminate the Twos? 

They needed more information. 
The trouble was they had to fight for 
every single datum, and it could only 
be a matter of time before some 
perhaps unimportant scrap of infor- 
mation cost someone his life. 

But the material they were sending 



back to Control was valuable. The 
reports and photographs of alien food 
labels and pictures and text would 
send language experts the world over 
into multilingual paroxysms of joy, 
not to mention the methods used to 
make friends with the Three life- 
form and their subsequent activities 
together. There was also a steady 
flow of information on Ship equip- 
ment and control systems which 
would be non-objectionable so far as 
Brady was concerned. 

They could not, of course, tell him 
everything. Some of their troubles 
they had to keep to themselves. 

Hollis took to crying in his sleep, 
during the rare occasions when he 
was able to get any. Drew collected 
and trained more Three pets than 
was really necessary for self-protec- 
tion. When he moved he was sur- 
rounded by a flapping phalanx of 
Threes, and prior to going to sleep 
he stroked and patted them until 
they had him enclosed in a thick, 
furry cocoon. Berryman and McCul- 
lough watched each other covertly 
and talked about their physical and 
psychological problems both as in- 
dividuals and as a group, the mean- 
ings behind the nightmares to which 
everyone was subject, and their past 
lives public and private — all with 
a simulated objectivity which fooled 
neither of them. Each was waiting 
for the other one to break, and each 
gained strength because the break did 
not come. 

The times they each woke up 
struggling and screaming did not 
count, of course, because they all 
did that. 

Walters, too, was unhappy. Cut

off from home except by voice con- 
tact with Prometheus Control, all of 
whom now sounded more nervous 
and insincere while talking to him 
than he felt while talking to them, 
it was obvious that the pilot was des- 
perately concerned for the safety of 
his friends — his only friends — on 
the Ship. During their infrequent 
radio contacts — it was just not 
possible these days for McCullough 
to visit him — the strain in his 
voice was an almost tangible thing. 

The general and Tokyo Rose were 
beginning to worry him again. They 
were suggesting that the facts sup- 
porting McCullough’s theory about 
the Ship’s builders using the dormi- 
tory compartments would also sup- 
port his own, perhaps more logical 
theory, that the tubular hammocks 
were meant to contain a couple of 
Twos and that it was the Twos who 
were the crew of the ship all the 
time. Walters did not want to bother 
the doctor with this kind of talk, 
but sometimes the general made it 
sound very believable. 

Walters was beginning to actively 
hate the general, and it showed in 
his voice. 

XX 

T hen one day they were forced to 
take cover in a room which 
was more thoroughly furnished, in 
the esthetic as well as the structural 
sense, than any they had encountered 
before. The room contained just two 
tubular hammocks, its cabinets and 
fixtures were much less utilitarian 
than usual, and there were a great 
many pictures on the walls. And soft- 



ly, in the background, there was the 
moaning, whistling sound which they 
had heard only once before but could 
never forget. 

But in this compartment the 
structural skeleton did not show, and 
the metal bones and circulatory sys- 
tem were too well concealed by 
paneling for them to hook up a 
suit-radio antenna to a section of 
plumbing which would allow con- 
tact with Walters. As a result Mc- 
Cullough could not tell the pilot of 
the tremendous discovery they had 
made or bring him into the discussion 
which followed it. 

“Crew quarters, no doubt about 
it,” Hollis said, waving his arms in 
excitement. “But I don’t think this 
room is only for sleeping in — its 
furniture is too diversified, there are 
too many pictures. Crowding a bed- 
room with pictures is in questionable 
taste . .” 

“So,” said Berryman, '“is having 
twin beds.” 

“Be serious a minute,” said Hollis. 
“The point I’m trying to make is 
that there is more than enough space 
in the Ship for crew members to have 
different rooms for sleeping, eating, 
recreation and so on while this com- 
partpient — a surprisingly small room 
in a very large ship — appears to 
combine the functions of all three. 
I may be jumping to conclusions 
here, but it suggests to me that they 
prefer small, confined, cozy living 
quarters. This place looks like . 
like an illustrated nest or ... I give 
up.” 

Berryman said, “I am only an 
amateur psychologist — a gifted 
amateur, naturally — but I’m in- 

; 141

clined to agree with that The ques- 
tion is if the crew prefers to live 
in cozy little rooms inside a great big 
ship — and with wild Twos roam- 
ing the corridors, who could blame 
them? — why aren’t they at home, 
do you suppose?” 

From the door’s transparent panel 
Drew, who was keeping watch, said, 
“The Twos are beginning to leave. 
A Three just went by, one of the 
carpets we haven’t made friends with 
yet, and they took off after it. Can 
I close the door?” 

“Not yet,” said McCullough. 

He h^ been too busy with his 
camera to join in the discussion, and 
his mind had been vainly trying to 
emulate the instrument by absorbing 
everything he could see at once. But 
he was not so wildly excited and 
curious as to forget caution or his 
own fairly well supported theory of 
the e-t crew-member being mentally 
disturbed and in possession of a pro- 
jectile-firing weapon. 

They might be in much more 
danger from the intelligent alien than 
from the hungry Twos. McCullough 
had ordered the sliding door to be 
kept partly open in case they should 
have to leave in a hurry. 

McCullough cleared his throat and 
said, “At the risk of sounding like 
General Brady, I suggest that the 
mass of important new data which 
has been made available should be 
very carefully considered before we 
make a move toward communicating 
with one of the crew.” 

With the exception of Drew they 
all returned to the study of the room’s 
fittings. They reminded each other 
several times that they were examin- 

142 



ing what were almost certainly per- 
sonal effects which should be treated 
with great care. Sometimes they 
laughed for no apparent reason or 
shouted in excitement or spoke in 
guilty whispers in case someone or 
something overheard them. 

As well as the medicine cabinet 
with its Three symbol, there were 
wall racks to which were clipped sur- 
prisingly Earthlike spools of tape or 
film. Another cabinet held books 
which were not illustrated, much to 
the men’s disappointment, and yet 
another contained flexible plastic 
tubes full of liquid and semi-liquid 
substances which smelled to high 
heaven. 

“Probably booze or beauty cream,” 
said Berryman as he wriggled out of 
an alien bed. He had been investi- 
gating the interiors of both ham- 
mocks. When his legs were clear he 
added. “They’re almost comfortable if 
it wasn’t for the dampness and 
smell. When you push against the 
inside the padding secretes some- 
thing which smells like . like 
.... It’s a damp smell, not alto- 
gether unpleasant.” 

McCullough investigated with eye 
and nose, finding that he had to 
push away several of the Threes to 
do so. But the animals were wriggling 
and flapping around only one one of 
the hammocks. He was reminded sud- 
denly of dogs excited by the scent of 
their master or by the clothing or 
personal possessions of their master. 
One of these beds had been occupied 
recently, he felt sure, or the Threes 
would not be so excited. He turned 
back to look again at those enig- 
matic pictures. 



IF 




M ost of them showed pallid, leaf- 
less vegetation set against a 
dark, mottled background or one 
that resembled rough-grained wood. 
While there was a definite feeling 
of depth to the pictures, there was no 
middle distance or horizon, and Mc- 
Cullough assumed that they were 
some kind of still life studies. But 
there were two pictures which had 
everything — size, perspective and 
almost photographic detail. One of 
them showed the plant or thing or 
whatever it was that they had at 
first mistaken for a multicolored 
pile of spaghetti,, with trees in the 
foreground and clouds behind to give 
a true indication of its tremendous 
size. Another showed trees with 
strange leaves on them, thick, wirey 
undergrowth harboring a running 
Two and a dazzlingly bright sky. A 
great njany questions regarding the 
Two life-form were answered by that 
picture. 

The e-t stag at bay, he thought 
drily. 

He could now tell General Brady 
that the Twos were, in fact, animals 
and not intelligent beings. While this 
knowledge would be a load off every- 
one’s mind it still meant that McCul- 
lough was faced with the problem of 
making contact with the intelligent- 
extra-terrestrial on the Ship, and all 
at once he was most horribly afraid 
and unsure of himself. He did not 
want the responsibility and he could 
not make the decision which was 
being forced on him — at least, not 
right now. 

In a couple of hours, perhaps. Or 
days .... 

Right now he wanted to slap an 



indefinite Hold on everything. He 
wanted time to look at all the evi- 
dence old and new, and discuss it 
quietly and in the greatest possible 
detail. This time he could not afford 
to push the wrong psychological 
button, for he was so firmly con- 
vinced that there was only one in- 
telligent extraterrestrial left in the 
Ship and that physically and emotion- 
ally it was not in good shape. 

It took a tremendous effort for 
him to make his voice sound firm 
and steady when he spoke. 

“Everybody out,” he said. “We 
must report this to Brady and decide 
on our next move. This time we 
can’t afford to make a mistake. Col- 
lect your Threes and let’s go. Quick- 
ly!” 

But the Threes did not want to 
leave. It took more than ten minutes 
coaxing and petting to make them 
leave the vicinity of that one cylin- 
drical hammock. Meanwhile Drew re- 
ported Twos beginning to gather a 
little way along the corridor and 
asked permission to close the door. 
Berryman, his Threes covering his 
body like a form-fitting fur coat, con- 
tinued to look around. 

Suddenly he called, “Over here!” 

The pilot had opened what he 
thought was the door of a recessed 
cupboard — there were a number 
of them in the room — and found 
himself looking along a short 
stretch of corridor. There was an- 
other door containing a large trans- 
parent panel at the other end, and 
beyond that another room which was 
in darkness except for the myriads 
of indicator lights burning like regi- 
mented stars on the facing wall. As 



ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



143 




they watched, a black shadow began 
to occlude '^me of the stars. 

**Outside!” shouted McCullough 
again. ‘‘Quickly, and make sure 
door is closed properly behind usl” 
“But there’s dozens of them out 
here,” said Drew angrily. “Some thing 
is biting them. I’ve never heard Twos 
make a noise like this before.” 

**Get out of here!** 

W hen the entrance to the alien 
crew’s compartment was safely 
closed behind him McCullough tried 
to explain why he had insisted on 
them leaving a relatively safe posi- 
tion for their present highly dangerous 
one. But they were all too angry to 
talk, and there were so many Twos 
in the corridor that they couldn’t 
risk taking their eyes off them to 
even look at him. Probably they were 
hating him for being stupid or a 
coward, or both. But McCullough, 
while scared stiff of meeting the 
alien face to face, had been even 
more afraid of another possibility. 

He had suddenly thought of the 
animal enclosure with its half-eaten 
body of the other crew member, and 
he had had a picture of what the 
Twos would do if they broke into 
that last compartment. 

He wondered if the alien had con- 
sidered his reaction cowardly, always 
supposing that the being was capable 
of reasoning at all. But even if grief 
over the loss of what was very prob- 
ably its mate, and loneliness and 
fear inside this vast. Two-infested 
ship — and possibly physical injuries 
as well — had driven it insane or 
close to insanity, a cowardly reaction 
might actually be reassuring to it. 



There was nobody who helped a 
coward like an even greater coward. 
But he could not cure the alien, or 
communicate with it, by running 
away all the time. 

On Earth psychiatric treatment of 
seriously disturbed patients — “in- 
sane” was not considered a nice 
word — had had only limited suc- 
cess. So what chance had a doctor 
who was not even a psychologist of 
curing a patient whose archetypal 
images were out of this world, whose 
phallic symbols were unrecognizable 
and whose culture contained in all 
probability a welter of psychological 
theories even more complex and 
mutually contradictory than those 
current on Earth? There might be 
some relatively simple form of ther- 
apy possible, of course. The e-t 
equivalent of the snake pit, where 
the patient cured itself with just a 
little unskilled help and a lot of 
symapthy. 

But that was asking for two 
much. Right now McCullough need- 
ed specialist advice and assistance, 
from Earth. 

“Back to the hull lock chamber,” 
he said. “We have to contact Wal- 
ters, and Brady. Hurry it upl” 

T he Twos attacked while he was 
speaking, filling the corridor 
with colliding, cartwheeling bodies 
and slashing, horn-tipped tentacles. 

In the confusion Drew and Hollis 
got three of them and Berryman one 
before they were able to pull clear 
of the melee. McCullough seriously 
wounded a couple of them and lost 
contact with his Three after the 
furry creature had started to strange 



144 



IP 




another Two which had heen trying 
to swarm onto his back. But suddenly 
it was with him again, flapping along 
behind him as they retreated along 
the corridor. He reached back, 
caught it and pulled it onto his 
shoulders like a great, furry cape. 

Suddenly they were trapped. An- 
other group of Twos came boiling 
out of an intersection ahead of them, 
bouncing off the wall-netting and 
each other like outsize, tentacled mo- 
lecules illustrating the Brownian 
movement of gases. 

Berryman shouted, “In here!” 

He was holding open the sliding 
door into a large dormitory compart- 
ment. They went through it back- 
ward, spears jabbing at full exten- 
sion, fighting off Twos. Seconds af- 
ter they had slid it shut, the door 
bulged alarmingly as several Twos 
charged it together, but it did not 
come off its runners. Drew and 
Berryman were able to get their 
spears through the warped outsides 
of the door and stab attacking Twos 
with comparative safety. They killed 
four of the animals — without, how- 
ever, seriously discouraging the at- 
tack. Hollis and McCullough, mean- 
while, made a quick check of the 
compartment. Their most important 
discoveries were another exit and, 
floating in one of the corners, a 
thick, illustrated magazine. 

The color reproduction and values 
were strange and the printed charac- 
ters even stranger, not to mention the 
raised, embossed pattern on the bot- 
tom outside comer of each page 
which allowed them to be turned by 
alien digits terminating in osseous ma- 
terial. But somehow it still managed 



to look like a copy of an illustrated 
magazine that might have been pick- 
ed up anywhere on Earth. McCul- 
lough longed for time to examine it 
and discuss it at length with the 
others. He wanted to photograph it 
page by page and have Walters trans- 
mit the pictures to Earth and have 
everyone there discuss it and offer 
specialist advice. 

But behind him the Twos were 
battering their way through the 
warped sliding door. McCullough 
folded the magazine carefully and 
wedged it between his air-tanks and 
his back, then led the way out of 
the other exit and along the corridor. 

They continued to duck in and out 
of compartments, some of which 
were large, inter-connected dormi- 
tories with several exits, and for sev- 
eral minutes they completely lost the 
Twos. By then they were completely 
lost themselves. 

“Berryman,” said McCullough, 
steadying himself against a hammock 
as he tried to catch his mental and 
physical breath. “Check the plumb- 
ing with a view to contacting Wal- 
ters. Hollis, help him. While you’re 
doing so try to think of a quick way 
of repairing the sabotaged generator. 
I’ll begin taping a report for the gen- 
eral while you two try to contact P- 
One.” 

But the Twos battered down the 
door a few minutes later, and they 
were forced to move again. 

Drew swore horribly and said that 
he did not know what had got into 
them. Normally ferocious and blind- 
ly antagonistic, they were now 
literally killing themselves, cracking 
open their bony carapaces against

the metal doors and running onto 
each other’s horns in their attempts 
to get at the humans. It was as if 
sonie dreadful hysteria had them in 
its grip and the grip was tightening 
by the minute. 

Some very special kind of killing 
instinct was being aroused, McCul- 
lough told himself as the men were 
forced to flee once again. It had to 
be a very deep-rooted instinct because 
these Twos were almost certaintly sec- 
ond or third generation. 

T he report was filially completed 
during a lull while the Twos, 
who were still in the grip of the con- 
ditioning which made them visit the 
food dispensers at mealtimes, were 
absent. Berryman identified a section 
of plumbing belonging to the hy- 
draulic system actuating the hull car- 
go locks and said that it should make 
a very good link with their ship. The 
pilot quickly connected his suit radio 
antenna, said that someone was al- 
ready talking at the other end and 
turned up the volume. 

Tinny, distorted and furiously 
angry, Brady’s voice rattled at them: 
. What you said was bad 
enough. Thoughtless, irresponsible, 
downright criminal considering the 
political situation here — and Vm 
disregarding the tone, which was in- 
subordinate to the point of mutiny! 
But those pictures, that cold-blooded 
slaughter of what are almost certain- 
ly intelligent beings — you've been 
secretive, McCullough is afraid even 
to talk to me, and no wonder! Kill- 
ing Twos has been reduced to a fine 
art, and judging by those pic- 
tures . ” 



“WaltersI” began McCullough. 
• • enjoying practicing that art! 
You act like barbarians instead of so- 
called reasoning beings! And you 
can't even claim the excuse of hon- 
est insanity, because your actions are 
too cold-blooded and carefully 
thought out. Moral cowardice, which 
is not an excuse, and megalomania is 
what ails you all! You made a mis- 
take, McCullough, made a mistake 
with the Twos at the onset and will 
slaughter every last one of them 
rather than admit it! I want to talk 
to you. Doctor. I know you're afraid 
to listen but .... ” 

“Turn him down, Walters, I want 
to talk to youl” 

“. all things being equal the 
simple rather than the complicated 
explanation is usually the true one! 
Try THIS theory. Doctor. It was 
evolved by people here who know 
their stuff arui it, also, fits the facts. 
The Ship dormitory accommodation 
was meant for its large complement 
of Twos. It may have been a coloni- 
zation project, a troop transport or 
it may simply have needed a very 
large crew. A couple of Twos could 
squeeze into those hammocks, you 
know — have you considered that? 
Then something happened during the 
early part of the trip, after the course 
had already been set for this solar 
system. 

Whatever catastrophe that oc- 
curred, it was almost certainly non- 
physical. The end result was a pro- 
cess of cultural devolution which 
brought the crew close to the level 
of animals. They broke into, not out 
of, the animal cages in search of 
food and eventually sank to practic- 



146 



IF

ing cannibalism. But they did not 
forget all their early training — or 
their ancestors^ early training — be^ 
cause they reacted violently toward 
anyone who appeared to threaten 
their Ship. 

‘7 can even make a prediction 
based on this theory, McCullough. It 
is this. The closer you approach the 
Ship*s control center — which the 
Twos must regard as some sort of 
mystic shrine or taboo area by now, 
since they know it is vital to the 
Ship without understanding why — 
the more their antagonism towards 
you will increase.** 

Berryman, Hollis and Drew were 
staring at him, faces chalk white 
and reflecting the same horrible fear 
and guilt and confusion that was 
gripping McCullough. He couldn’t be 
so wrong, he told himself desperate- 
ly. He didn’t have to listen to all 
of tbisl 

. beyond appeals to reason. 
The world is judging us, your country 
and everyone in it by your actions. 
But you don*t care about that, do 
you? Well, we don*t care about you! 
Believe me, if we directed the two 
remaining supply rockets off course 
we would not be too strongly criti- 
cized for doing so. We*re ashamed 
of you, McCullough, and the rest of 
your murdering pack. You* re little 
more than mad dogs! You sicken and 
disgust us!** 

Brady’s voice began to fade as 
Walters on P-One reduced the 
volume. 

But not soon enough. 

• . nobody here wants you, 
d*you understand that? We don*t 
want to see you back!** 



M ental anguish could take many 
forms, McCullough thougiht 
sickly, ranging from simple worry 
over a possible future unpleasant- 
ness to the deep grief at the loss of 
a dear one. But those were clean, un- 
complicated emotions, whatever their 
degree of intensity. This was the 
twisting, almost physical pain of be- 
trayal by a trusted friend who turns 
suddenly into an enemy raised to the 
nth power. For it was not only their 
personal friends at Prometheus who 
had betrayed and rejected them, it 
was their whole lousy race! 

From the shocked, angry faces all 
around him McCullough knew that 
only two reactions were possible. 
Anger and counterattack ... or ex- 
treme, soul-destroying guilt and des- 
pair. 

But they had come through too 
much together on the Ship, they had 
overcome too many purely physical 
dangers, for them to die of a collec- 
tive broken heart. He told himself 
that this was so, but he was hot sure 
that he could believe himself. He 
could not be sure of anything any 
more. 

A metallic crash from the door told 
of the Twos, even more angry prob- 
ably because the food dispensers were 
no longer giving food, beginning to 
return from “lunch.” He wondered 
suddenly if intelligent beings could 
sink so low as to eat animal’s food> 
and thought that they might if some- 
thing had happened to the crew water 
and food supply. But Brady’s theory 
was too simple, surely. There were 
facts that it did not explain. 



ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



147 




And one fact in particular was 
deafeningly obvious. 

‘I’m not a psychologist ” said 
McCullough quietly, trying to con- 
trol his relief and excitement, “but it 
seems to me that the last thing an 
intelligent person would forget is how 
to open and close a door.” 

He turned to the radio and went on 
quickly, “So you showed him pic- 
tures of us dumping Twos into space. 
But I can guess at some of the things 
he said to make you do it, so don’t 
worry. Just link me with the trans- 
mitter, Walters. There is something 
I want to say to him.” 

He had begun by speaking quietly 
to the pilot, and his voice was still 
soft. But the anger that had crept 
into it when he spoke to the general 
made it unrecognizable even to him- 
self. 

“We feel sorry for you, General 
Brady,” he said. “We feel sorry for 
all you people. It would be a lie to 
say that we don’t feel angry and dis- 
gusted with you as well, but we do 
feel sorry. The harsh facts of contact 
with an extra-terrestrial culture are 
being brought home to you, to all of 
you. You are all frightened. The im- 
plications are only now beginning to 
dawn on you. And you feel guilty 
and ashamed because things may not 
have been handled right. It is a very 
uncomfortable time for all of you, 
and your feelings and qualms of 
conscience do you credit. But you. 
General, and aU of you, are so un- 
comfortable that you want to avoid 
both the responsibility and the guilt 
by passing it onto us. Then, pre- 
sumably, you will bury and forget 
the whole thing by disowning us I 



“There is nothing original about 
this course,” McCullough went on. 
“It is a cleu case of your eyes and 
your hands scandalizing you, and you 
then quote the highest possible 
Authority regarding your subsequent 
action in the matter. If your right 
eye scandalize thee, pluck it out. If 
your right hand scandalise thee, cut 
it off and cast it from thee, and so 
on. But if you were thinking straight 
you would realize that this is not a 
true analogy. We are not just your 
hands and eyes, we are a cross sec- 
tion of all the people of Earth. That 
is what’s really bothering you, and 
you know it! What we feel toward 
the aliens is what you would feel in 
the same circumstances; our thoughts 
would be your thoughts, our actions 
and reactions yours as well. You 
know this is true, but you don’t want 
to face up to it. Instead you are 
making us the scapegoats. 

“We are doing the best we can 
with the situation here,” he con- 
tinued more quietly. “We are better 
qualified to understand it, since we 
are on the spot, and we are con- 
vinced that we are doing the right 
thing. A tape containing much 
valuable new information has been 
prepared. This will be placed in a 
Two-proof storage cabinet and 
played back to you while we head 
for the hull to repair the damaged 
generator. While this is being done. 
Twos permitting, we shall make con- 
tact with the surviving intelligent 
members, or more likely member, of 
the Ship’s crew. 

“In Ae meantime. General, lay off 
Walters! What you’re doing to him 
is criminal and stupid. He is not re- 



148 



IF 




sponsible for our actions inside the 
Ship. He is all alone, cut off from 
radio contact with us for days on 
end, not knowing whether we are 
alive or dead and now believing that 
you don’t care what happens to him. 
If you can’t appreciate his position 
ask your space medics — he must 
be clinging to sanity by his fingernails! 

“You might also consider our po- 
sition. There are only two functioning 
spacesuits left to us, we’re constantly 
under attack or being forced to hide 
from Twos, and some of us haven’t 
slept for three days. Now you have 
turned against us and are threatening 
to turn the supply vehicles off course. 
This isn’t fair. We’re a long way 
from home, and you’ve literally got 
us outnumbered billions to one. If 
those replacement suits don’t arrive 
we can never leave this Ship — ” 

McCullough broke off. He was 
beginning to whine, and the realiza- 
tion made him angry. He could see 
the weary despair in the expressions 
of the others as they watched him, 
and hear the Twos stepping up their 
attack on the door. But this was not 
the reason why he raised his voice. 

“If you maroon us here, either by 
accident or design, there is something 
you should bear in mind. We have 
lived on e-t food and recycled water 
since the last supply vehicle went 
wide. The food is palatable if one is 
hungry enough, and the taste of the 
water is due to us thinking too much 
about its original source. So we can 
stay here if necessary. We can go 
back with the Ship to its home planet 
and . and see things that nobody 
in all of human history has seen be- 
fore. 



“So you can’t reject us. General,” 
he ended furiously. “Or cast us off 
or do anything at all to us ... be- 
cause we danm well quitV* 

A few minutes later they left by 
the other exit, moving in what 
they hoped was the direction of the 
hull and the generator blister. From 
the suit radios of Berryman and Hol- 
lis, McCullough’s voice came as a 
tinny, stereophonic duet as they 
monitored the tape transmission. 
Should it cease that would mean that 
the storage cabinet containing the 
linked radio and recorder was not as 
Two-proof as they had hoped. 

. already, treated design and 
structural philosophy in detail,” the 
voice was saying, '*and our deduc- 
tions regarding the home planet* s 
gravity, atmospheric conditions and 
environment have been supported by 
pictures on living quarters walls and 
in illustrated literature. Regarding 
these living quarters, however . ” 
“Which way?” said Berryman. “I 
don’t know whether we’re headed for- 
ward, outboard or aft.” 

McCullough could hear the Twos 
breaking their way out of the com- 
partment they had just vacated — 
the things were like extra-terrestrial 
bloodhounds! He said, “Right, I 
think.” 

“. construction personnel lived 
on board and vacated their quarters, 
which are rather stark, when the pro- 
tect was complete. The large number 
of empty storage compartments, liv- 
ing quarters and, most of all, the 
fact that entry hatches and lighting 
circuits tend to be on local rather than 
centralized control, and that there are

no indications of permanent com- 
munications lines between compart- 
ments, makes us sure that they were 
used only by the construction gang. 

**The strongest probability is that 
the large size of the Ship was dictated 
by the operating requirements of its 
hyperdrive generators and that in this, 
its first flight, it has been operating 
as an interstellar probe containing 
automatic guidance and sensory 
equipment and a number of animals 
being tested for survival in space 
conditions, together with a small 
crew who were little more than in- 
telligent specimens undergoing the 
same testing. Indications are that the 
*crew* have virtually no control over 
the operation of the Ship, and that 
initially they numbered only two 

They were in a long corridor which 
seemed to be going in the wrong 
direction. Every Two in the Ship 
seemed to be after them, but just 
out of sight. 

. • We assumed the Two life- 
form to be unintelligent because 
they showed no indication of possess- 
ing an organized language, no manual 
dexterity in opening and closing 
doors or operating light switches and 
no inclination to communicate. Here 
we must mention our belief that an 
intelligent species making contact for 
the first time would make allowances 
for a certain amount of to them un- 
conventional behavior and would not 
react with such continual and violent 
hostility. In the light of this assump- 
tion we will consider the situation in 
the animal enclosure . , 

“If we were moving outboard there 
should be more intersections,” said 
Hollis.” “One at every deck level.” 



The Twos were in sight behind 
them again, boiling along the corri- 
dor like tumbleweeds in a hurricane, 
bouncing from wall-net to wall-net as 
their tentacles hurled them on. Un- 
like the humans they did not worry 
about hurting themselves or protect- 
ing the two remaining usable space- 
suits, so they were gaining steadily. 

a/^bvious that the Twos broke out 

v-x and virtually exterminated all 
other animal life-forms with the ex- 
ception of the Threes which, although 
non-hostile where we and the intelli- 
gent e-t life-form are concerned, can 
defend themselves against the Twos. 
The Twos bred unrestrained, living 
off the automatic food dispensers 
and any other experimental animal 
which had escaped the initial slaugh- 
ter, their numbers controlled by their 
habit of fighting and eating each 
other. 

**One of the half-eaten carcasses 
in the animal enclosure belonged to 
a large, caterpillar-like life-form 
which was quite obviously unsuited 
to the cage in which it was found. 
Around it were the bodies of Twos 
which, in addition to being canni- 
balized, showed numerous punctured 
wounds in musculature and bone 
structure, of the kind made by a 
solid projectile-firing weapon. 

**lt is now obvious that this cater- 
pillar life-form, which later data 
proves to be intelligent, was killed 
trying to contain the original break- 
out. The weapon may have been 
used by this being against the Twos 
and later retrieved by the second in- 
telligent e-t from its body, or the 
second e-t used it in an attempt to

rescue or avenge the first one . 

**No good,” said Hollis breath- 
lessly as he ducked out of yet an- 
other useless compartment “Only 
one door.” 

The room might have given them 
indefinite protection if they could 
have defended the door against 
Twos, but there were no wall-nets in- 
side storage and dormitory compart- 
ments and no means of bracing them- 
selves against attack. If the Twos suc- 
ceeded in battering their ways in, the 
result would be a shambles of twist- 
ing, spinning bodies and stabbing, 
slashing spears and tentacles. Most of 
the casualties would be on the human 
side. 

If they had to fight Twos it was 
better done in a corridor. 

, . Before listing the data and 
reasoning which leads us ta believe 
that there were only two intelligent 
e^ts crewing the Ship, and that one 
of them still survives in a physically 
and mentally damaged condition, we 
must deal with what is known and 
deduced about their home planet*s en- 
vironment and culture . 

At McCullough’s signal they check- 
ed themselves against the wall-net, 
faced inward and laced their feet and 
legs through the strands so as not to 
be tom free during the attack. The 
butts of their spears were jammed 
against the net’s supporting brackets 
or any other convenient projection. 
And they waited, McCullough 
thought, for all the world like a 
bunch of medieval foot soldiers about 
to soak up a cavalry charge. 

“Since we left the crew’s quarters 
. ” began Hollis, then finished 
with a rush, “I think we picked up 



some kind of scent in there. It’s 
driving them mad. 1 recognize Twos 
we wounded a couple of weeks ago, 
and every blasted Two in the Ship 
must be after us. This is a good 
chance for us to wipe them out com- 
pletely.” 

“Have you counted them?” said 
Berryman bitterly. 

“Sixteen,” said Drew. 

. whose gravity, pressure and 
atmospheric composition is similar 
to Earth*s — which is probably the 
chief reason for the Ship*s presence 
here. Observation of pictures of 
planetary flora and fauna suggest a 
world subject tojrequent or perhaps 
constant high winds . .” 

The leading Twos were only yards 
and split seconds away. 

XXII 

T hey could not be sure where ex- 
actly the Threes and Ones 
fitted into the picture, but the po- 
sition of the intelligent caterpillars and 
the Twos was now plain. 

The tentacled animal with the sin- 
gle, underslung horn was a carni- 
vore, of course, and the natural en- 
emy of the intelligent e-ts. They had 
adapted well to weightless conditions, 
but on the home planet their normal 
method of locomotion was to use the 
large, curved horn as a sort of skid 
while propelling themselves with 
their tentacles. The skid also served 
as a weapon when jumping onto their 
prey. Or, when plunged into soft 
ground during periods of high wind, 
as an anchor which allowed the Two 
to seize smaller animals with its ten- 
tacles as they blew helplessly past.

The plant life was uniformly 
alien. 

Smaller plants consisted of a 
long, flexible stem which, because of 
the wind, lay on or close to the 
ground. The stem carried a number 
of large, thick leaves with thorns or 
rootlets on their undersides and seem- 
ed to combine the process of photo- 
synthesis with the digestion of ground- 
burrowing insects. At the other end 
of the scale were the giant trees tower- 
ing hundreds of feet into the air, with 
trunks fifty feet in diameter and mas- 
sive, stubby branches in proportion. 

Because of their tremendous thick- 
ness the trunks and branches bent 
only slightly in the wind. Their leaves 
were enormous airfoils controlled 
either by the vegetable nervous sys- 
tem of the tree or by some automatic 
stabilizer system in the leaf itself, so 
that they streamed out to leeward 
while maintaining a formation which 
kept every leaf in sunshine. 

The leaves were the only opaque 
parts of the trees. Trunk and branches 
were translucent, except for dark 
areas occurring at irregular intervals 
— which could have been parasitic 
growths or caused by small animals 
being dashed against the trunk by 
the wind. Other dark patches were 
various forms of animal life existing 
inside the trees. 

Another growth or structure which 
had puzzled them until pictures be- 
came available which gave a true in- 
dication of its size was the heap of 
varicolored, translucent spaghetti. 
This mass appeared flexible and open 
enough for the wind to blow through 
it without putting too much strain 
on the individual tubes, which divided 



and sub-divided at intervals and con- 
tained hundreds of bulbous swellings 
along their length before rejoining 
into a single stem again or linldng up 
with another stem. From the top of 
this squirming and strangely beauti- 
ful mass hundreds of metallic blooms 
on ridiculously thin stems trailed in 
the wind. 

Eventually they realized that they 
were seeing an alien city. A great, 
artificial tree with trailing windmill 
blooms supplying power to a structure 
which must extend a considerable 
depth below the surface. 

The wind was such an integral part 
of the aliens’ lives that on the Ship 
the sounds it made were played like 
background music .... 

. Originally the intelligent e-ts 
must have developed from a species 
of burrowing tree-dweller. Physically 
they resemble outsize, leathery cater- 
pillars whose heads are very well sup- 
plied with teeth which now show 
signs of advanced atrophication. They 
have four mandibles, terminating in 
flexible digits which appear both 
strong and highly sensitive . ” 

The first one came at them along 
the center of the corridor, shell first 
like a tentacled cannonball. Their 
spears were useless against that 
bony carapace so they flattened 
themselves against the net and let it 
sail past. The next one came spin- 
ning at them edge on the tentacles 
^flailing; close to the wall occupied by 
Drew. He guided his spear into the 
soft area below the edge of the shell 
and between the tentacles. The mo- 
mentum of the Two’s dive did the 
rest. He pitchforked the dying animal 
down the corridor.

IF 




. this deeply rooted racial 
agoraphobia — they are burrowers, 
after all, even if they do burrow 
through nearly transparent trees. The 
murals, illustrations and especially 
the close-fitting hammocks support 
this. 

**lt could be argued that the pro- 
cess of overcoming this agoraphobia 
and achieving the level of technology 
evident here was a slow one, which 
means that they could he much 
farther advanced in the sociological 
sciences than we are, and a peaceful 
first contact would be possible — 
if it wasn*t for the suspected mental 
damage . 

T hey came at them two and three 
at a time, seeming to fill the 
corridor from wall to wall with 
flailing tentacles. 

McCullough got his spear to a 
vital spot, but in the act of pushing 
the furiously dying thing away he 
felt a tentacle crash excruciatingly 
against his legs. When he could see 
again there was a Two crawling up 
his legs, and he had too long a hold 
on his weapon for it to bear. He 
twisted frantically to the side, pulled 
one leg out of the net and drew it 
up until the knee touched his chin, 
then stamped down hard on the base 
of the Two’s horn. Reaction from the 
blow dislodged his other foot from 
the net, but the kick must have in- 
flicted severe internal damage be- 
cause the two went into violent con- 
vulsions and died. 

“Dirty fighting, sir,” said Drew, 
who had just finished off another by 
more conventional methods. “I must 
remember that trick.” 



Both his legs were sticking out in- 
to the corridor. Before McCuUou^ 
could swing them back another Two 
grabbed his foot. This time the spear 
would bear all right, but he jabbed 
himself in the leg before he was able 
to kill it. Strangely the only pain he 
felt was one of loss — there was 
only one functioning spacesuit left 
now. But there was no time to think 
about that for long. The corridor was 
a solid mass of struggling alien and 
human bodies, a nightmare of ten- 
tacles, legs, arms, furry carpets, 
stabbing horns and spears. And over 
the high-pitched gobblings and furious 
voices of the combatants there was 
the quiet voice of McCullough ex- 
pounding his theories regarding alien 
psychology. 

.. So far as we can tell the 
Two life-form is the enemy of every- 
thing which lives and moves, but 
particularly of the intelligent e-ts who 
made up the crew of the Ship. It is 
small wonder, then, that the single 
remaining alien refuses to come out 
of its quarters. A high level of fear 
must be added to the loneliness and 
lack of support from its fellows 
which it is suffering — feelings 
which we ourselves are in a very 
good position to appreciate. If we also 
assume them to belong to a bisexual 
race, and there is no evidence against 
this, then the crew were probably 
mated 

McCullough fended off a violently 
dying alien with a Three on its back, 
and saw that Drew was in serious 
trouble. 

He had lost his spear. A Two had 
its tentacles wrapped around his hips 
and waist. He was trying frantically 



ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



153 




to push it off him, both hands flat 
against its underbelly and arms stif- 
fened. This was how Morrison had 
died. McCullough thought sickly as 
he swung up his spear and took care- 
ful aim so as not to stab Drew. 

But before he could do anything 
a second Two landed on Drew’s back 
and drove its horn right through his 
chest. Drew’s arms went limp and 
he was caught, sandwiched and im- 
paled between the two of them, For 
an instant he looked appealingly at 
McCullough, his face yellow-white 
with shock, and tried to say some- 
thing. But only blood came out, and 
McCullough killed both the Twos 
without worrying about jabbing 
Drew. 

T hen suddenly the corridor was 
clear. The Twos had dived and 
spun and blundered their way past. 
The half dozen or so that had sur- 
vived were clinging to the netting a 
short distance along the corridor, 
preparing to attack again. 

. If the crew member has lost 
its mate, especially if the survivor 
is the weaker or less technically quali- 
fied of the two, this would further 
aggravate its emotionally disturbed 
condition as well as explain the lack 
of interference during our explora- 
tion. 

*'There is also a strong possibility 
that the survivor is physically as v^ell 
as mentally damaged. But it is, of 
course, the mental aspect which con- 
cerns us at the present time . ." 

“Here they come,” said Berryman 
in a voice which was too weary to 
show emotion. 

McCullough dragged his eyes away 



from the gruesome three-body prob- 
lem which was Drew and tried des- 
perately to pretend that none of this 
was happening, that soon he would 
wake up somewhere, anywhere, else. 

But he did not wake up. The Twos 
rushed down on him, figments of a 
nightmare which was not even of 
Earth. Their tentacles spread and coil- 
ed like the legs of great, fat spiders 
and that horrible, obscene horn 
jabbed and quivered and gave every 
attack the added horror of indecent 
assault. 

“. psychology is far from be- 
ing an exact science, and it is dif- 
ficult enough to cure the aberrations 
of a human being . .” 

Twice his spear made a wet, 
thudding sound and another pair of 
Twos spun out of sight. He began 
to think that they might, after all, 
succeed in exterminating the animals. 
It was obvious that they were all 
here, attracted by the scent the hu- 
mans had picked up in the crew 
quarters. With the Twos out of the 
way they could investigate the Ship 
at leisure, building up a picture of 
the culture of its home planet and 
getting to know and understand the 
alien crew-member before actual con- 
tact was attempted. 

But then everything went suddenly 
wrong. 

Berryman speared a Two just as 
another came spinning close to the 
net on McCullough’s side. The doctor 
lunged, missed and had to fend it 
off with his feet. Both animals 
crashed together just as a third ar- 
rived on the scene, and within sec- 
, onds the remainder of the Twos were 
adding to the pile-up. McCullough

IF 




lost his spear — he couldn’t bring 
it to bear anyway — and somebody 
screamed and then went on cursing. 
McCullough wanted to laugh, because 
that meant the wound had not been 
immediately fatal. 

He threw his arms around a pass- 
ing Two, hugging its bony shell 
close to his chest so that its horn 
and threshing tentacles formed a de- 
fensive shield. He shouted, “Get out 
of here! Crawl along the wall-net! 
get clear?' 

They kicked and wrestled their way 
free of the jam, Berryman first, then 
Hollis and McCullough trailed by 
their madly flapping Threes. Already 
the first Twos were beginning to give 
chase. 

“We have to find shelter,” Berry- 
man gasped as they sailed along the 
corridor. “A good, strong door — ” 

Hollis was looking back over his 
shoulder. He said, “Only . only 
five of them left . ” 

“In here!” 

Berryman had stopped and was 
clinging to the net beside a door, 
one arm out to check Hollis. They 
pulled the door aside and within 
seconds the pilot’s head, shoulders 
and spear showed around the edge 
as he prepared to defend it until the 
others arrived. 

Behind them the Twos went sud- 
denly berserk. 

“iVo!” McCullough shouted ur- 
gently. **Berryman, get out of there!" 

But it was too late. 

A Two hurled itself past both 
Hollis and himself without bothering 
even to strike at them. It impaled 
itself on Berryman’s spear, driving 
the haft backward between the wall 



and the sliding panel. Berryman yell- 
ed that he couldn’t free his spear — 
and the door was jammed open. 

Hollis had caught the netting beside 
the door and was about to go through 
when McCullough arrived behind 
him. The doctor gripped the net firm- 
ly, planted both feet in the small 
of the physicist’s back and pushed 
hard. Berryman looked at McCul- 
lough as if he had just committed 
murder. 

“Contact Walters!” McCullough 
yelled as Hollis went spinning down 
the corridor. “Clear the short in the 
generator! And don’t worry about the 
Twos — they aren’t interested in you 
now!” 

They would not follow Hollis — 
because Berryman had just opened 
another way into the crew quarters. 

I t was a different entrance, opening 
into a compartment they had not 
seen before. One wall was covered 
with the bright, translucent murals 
McCullough had come to know so 
well, and the rest of the small room 
was devoted to storage cabinets. There 
was a sound of wind blowing through 
alien trees. It was unoccupied. 

McCullough pointed to the room’s 
inner door and said, very seriously, 
“They mustn’t kill the last survivor. 
We’ve done enough harm to the 
Ship as it is. We’ve got to Idll every 
last one of them here and now.” 

“. And in conclusion we must 
state that the surviving e-f, for physi- 
cal or mental reasons or both, is al- 
most certainly helpless . .” 

It was a large doorway. The spear 
jammed across it did not form an ef- 
fective barrier. 



ALL JUDGMENT FLED

The first attacker blundered onto 
Berryman’s spear, the second batted 
it aside with one tentacle and reach- 
ed for him with the other three. 
With no net to steady him, suspend- 
ed weightless and helpless in the 
middle of the room, Berryman was 
being pulled onto its horn when a 
Three got between them and was 
caught instead. It fluttered like a 
furry flag and died while Berryman 
struggled free. The rest of the Twos 
were swarming in. 

McCullough took a blow on the 
shoulder, nearly paralyzing his arm, 
and suddenly there was a Two with 
its tentacles around his head and 
shoulder and its horn only inches 
away from his face. He let go his 
spear and grabbed for the horn with 
both hands. It was dry and hot and 
felt like rough wood. The whole, 
twitching mass of its underbelly was 
eily with alien sweat or saliva and 
the stink made him want to be sick. 
The room rotated slowly around them 
as their struggles made them spin. 

Berryman swam into sight beside a 
dying Two. He was terribly wounded 
and large, red bubbles were forming 
and breaking away from his abdo- 
men and chest. A Three was trying 
to spread itself over him so as to 
staunch the flow of blood, and 
wriggling because Berryman, an ex- 
pression on his face that was almost 
sublime, kept running his fingers 
through the fur on its back. The pilot 
swung into sight three or four times 
before McCullough saw that he had 
died. And still the doctor gripped 
the Two’s horn and tried desperately 
to push it away. 

But it clung and tightened its hold 



and hung' above his head like a vile> 
alien umbrella. His legs were en- 
circled, and another Two swarmed 
awkwardly along his body. He tried 
to kick it away, but it was too high 
up. Then he saw that there was a 
Three on its back, the flat, furry 
body oozing between the Two’s 
tentacles, blinding and smothering it 
in tight, clinging fur until it drifted 
away dead. 

But the Threes were fluttering and 
flapping all over the compartment, 
un^dlling for some reason to come 
to his aid. His spear was drifting a 
few feet away, but he dared not let 
go of the horn for even a second 
and expect to live. The Two kept 
changing its grip and each time the 
horn came a little closer. His arms 
were very tired .... 

“. In general terms its psy- 
chological troubles stem from lone- 
liness, grief, and fear caused by its 
being surrounded by enemies. It 
must feel that there is nobody who 
cares whether it lives or dies, 

**We know so little about this be- 
ing that curative therapy is beyond 
us. But if its basic needs are enough 
like ours and if its mental condition 
has not already reached the point of 
no return we might, by our actions 
alone, show it that . ." 

McCullough tried to count slowly 
to ten. He thought that if he could 
just hold^ off that horrible yellow 
horn for ten seconds he would be 
able to do it for another ten seconds. 
But the muscles in his back were 
cracking and his arms felt as if they 
were on fire. He closed his eyes 
tightly because he was horribly afraid 
of seeing himself being killed.

. and eventually make it re- 
alize that it isn*t alone and that some- 
one, us, is trying to help i/ . 

T he noise in that confined space 
was incredible. 

McCullough opened his eyes to 
see chunks of tentacles and shell be- 
ing tom off his Two. Then he saw 
why the Threes were so excited: the 
weapon with its odd double stock and 
very ordinary magazine and barrel, 
and the being who was holding it. 

He saw, too, the four manipula- 
tors encircling the alien’s head, three 
of which were so badly damaged that 
it was a miracle it was able to hold 
the weapon at all, and the awful. 
Two-inflicted scars running Ae length 
of its body. He looked last at its 
eyes, and for a long time neither of 
them did anything. Then the alien 
pushed its machine-gun away, and 
McCullough, now that his taped re- 
port had come to an end, began call- 
ing Hollis and Walters on his suit 
radio. 

xxm 

B oth supply rockets with their 
water, food and spare spacesuits 
went off course. 

When he told him about it Wal- 
ters’s voice was strained. McCul- 
lough could imagine the pilot’s feel- 
ings — the fear of how the doctor 
might react, his pleas for help which 
the pilot could not possibly give him 
and Walters’s own, personal fear of 
the long voyage home with Hollis 
in a vehicle which had already pass- 
ed the time limit for operational 
safety. When the pilot went on speak- 



ing, his cheerfulness was obviously 
forced. 

He said, *‘Brady feels terrible 
about this. He says you did the 
right thing despite his and everyone 
else’s opposition. He’s sorry for the 
things he said to you, and he says he 
deserved everything you said to him. 
He — well, he’s beginning to sound 
like Churchill — the debt owed you 
by the whole of humanity, the im- 
measurable social and scientific ad- 
vances this first contact will bring 
about, and so on. He wishes there 
was only some way to bring all of us 
back.” 

' The pilot broke off, then said awk- 
wardly, “You said earlier how terri- 
fic a Aing it would be to travel to 
another solar system . .” 

McCullough and Hollis looked at 
each other, and the alien watched 
both of them. They were in the an- 
techamber of the generator blister, 
where the physicist had just complet- 
ed repairs. The e-t had followed them 
there as it followed them everywhere. 
Sometimes the being made noises at 
them or waved its mandible or ex- 
changed sketches. But mostly it just 
hung there and watched. 

It was possible that the being was 
security conscious or anxious lest they 
commit further acts of sabotage. But 
McCullough did not think so. To his 
way of thinking the e-t was simply 
glad of the company. Any company. 

To Walters he said. “It seem^ 
like a fine idea at the time. But I 
wasn’t thinking straight just then. No 
doubt someone will bust a gut to get 
going, and soon. If, as I am con- 
vinced, we can duplicate the Ship’s 
drive. But I prefer to go home.”

“But, sir . 

“Hollis’s suit is still in one piece, 
and 1 have an idea. Last week it 
would not have been a good idea.** 

. Because last week Berryman 
and Drew were alive and botib P- 
ships would have been needed to get 
them home .... 

By the time he had finished exr 
plaining, Walters was much happier. 
The pilot said briskly, “Two days 
should be enough for the job, but 
I’ll contact Brady at once asking for 
a course based on a four-day count- 
down. That will give us time to 
check our ship. And . and I’ll 
tell them we want return tickets 
for three!” 

He had to explain his idea to 
the alien then, but that was not 
too difficult because the old adage 
about a good picture being worth 
two thousand words held true even 
among extra-terrestrials. But the re- 
sult was that the alien stuck even 
closer to him from then on, especial- 
ly when Hollis was working on P- 
One. And it kept forcing things on 
him, things like odd pieces of equip- 
ment, the lovely, glowing murals and 
carvings, books and film spools as 
well as food and water. McCullough 
explained graphically about fuel re- 
serves and weight allowances and 
knew that the alien understood, but 
it still continued to give him things. 

Then early in the second day Hol- 
lis completed his work on P-One. On 
the Ship a large cargo hatch swung 
open; and Walters, moving very slow- 
ly and carefully, edged toward it. The 
two P-ships were docked nose to 
nose, and Hollis had stripped P-One 
of all its projecting antenna, collect- 



ors and sensory equipment and had 
completely remoyed the return fuel 
tanks and motors so that the bare 
command module would fit, just 
nicely, into the large cargo lock. 

Walters slid the stripped-down P- 
One into the cargo lock, detached 
it from P-Two and withdrew. The 
outer seal was closed and pressure 
restored. Hollis, McCullough and the 
alien began transfei'ring quantities of 
food, water, artifacts, photographs 
and sketches which they had placed 
in the corridor into the module. Then 
they wedged it firmly into the lock 
chamber — a present from Earth for 
a culture an unguessable number of 
light-years away. 

And suddenly it was time to go. 

I t had been relatively easy to ex- 
change simple concepts via sketch- 
pad, but there was no way at all for 
him to tell what it was thinking dur- 
ing those last few minutes in the air- 
lock. It was just a great, fat, cater- 
pillar, an LSD nightmare with too 
many eyes and mouths in all the 
wrong places, for him to be able to 
read such a subtle thing as a facial 
expression — and the problem cut 
both ways. All he could do was look 
at it for a few minutes while it looked 
at him, then follow Hollis into P- 
One. 

The cargo hatch swung open, air 
whistled into space and Walters came 
edging back with P-Two. He docked, 
they transferred themselves and their 
stores and artifacts into P-Two and 
drifted away again. The cargo hatch 
closed, Walters used steering thrust 
briefly, and the great Ship efU slowly 
away fiom them.

For a loiig time McCullough did 
not speak. He was thinking about the 
alien he had just left and its Ship 
and the beings who had sent her out, 
and wondering what they would think 
of his people — the people who had 
left three of their dead aboard, killed 
while trying to clear the Ship of a 
particularly nasty form of vermin. 
And in one of the cargo locks there 
was a human artifact, a tiny, ridicu- 
lous, fragile shell which had carried 
three human beings more than fifty 
million miles out to their Ship. He 
did not know what they would think 
about his people, but that P-ship 
should tell them a lot.

Walters had completed a last atti- 
tude check and was listening to Con- 
trol during the last few seconds of 
the countdown when the generator 
blisters on the Ship glowed suddenly. 
In. an instant it had shrunk from 
sight. 

Hollis gave a great sigh of relief. 
“I was worried in case I’d botched 
the repair job,” he said. Then he 
looked closely at McCXillough and 
added, “Don’t worry, Doctor, our 
friend will be all right. It’s going 
home.” 

Walters was moving his lips silent- 
ly. Suddenly he pressed the thrust 
button and said, “So are we!” END

AND 

CRY 



Dear Editor; 

I read with delightful pleasure 
To Serve the Master a t in your Sep- 
tember 1967 copy of If. Mr. (or is 
it Mrs.) Gaughan did a beautiful 
job of illustrating it. 

Your cover for September issue 
was beautiful; not at all a match 
for the story. Bride Ninety-One was 
poor taste. — (Mrs.) J. H. Owens, 
Rt. 4, Box 401-J, Mobile, Alabama.

Dear Editor: 

When you said that If should have 
a fantasy story once in awhile like 
Faust Aleph-Null, I thought that it 
would ruin the whole character of 
the magazine. But I was completely 
wrong. It would be a credit to the 
magazine if you put in a fantasy 
novel even more often than you had 
planned. 

I just started reading If this 
summer. The only reason I picked 
it up off of the newsstand was be- 
cause there was an Andre Norton 
story on the inside. I enjoyed this 
story and the rest of the book very 
much so I started buying it monthly. 

I notice that fans don't usually 
ask more than one question in a fan 
letter, and for me one question would 
just not satisfy my curiosity. So 
here it goes. 

1 think that Lancer supplies the 



country with the best adventure fan- 
tasy books. Any reader of adventure- 
fantasy should read the Conan series 
by Howard, I would like to know if 
Howard's other stories will be re- 
printed after the 8 books of the 
Conan series are completed? I would 
like to know also if Ed Bradbury is 
going to write any more stories to 
his Martian series and if 1he is re- 
lated to Ray Bradbury? 

I can't see why writers don't ex- 
pand on a story into a series. Could 
you tell science-fiction fans how 
many Doc Savage novels Kenneth 
Robson wrote and how many books 
Neil R. Jones wrote in his famous 
Parofessor Jameson series of which 
Ace has printed the first three? The 
Jameson series is a must to all read- 
ers. 

Of all the companies I like Ace 
the best. Do you think that Andre 
Norton's The Star Hunters will be 
reprinted soon? 

Critics say that Kline is one of the 
closest contempories of ERB so 
could you tell me if he has any more 
books out besides his three Venus 
books, two Martians, one moon story 
and Jan of the Jungle! 

I read somewhere that Gardner F. 
Fox works for a magazine company. 
What is it? And is he planning on 
writing another book on Llarn? 



161 




My last question is this; When is 
there groing to be the second book 
in the series Tamsman of Gor by 
John Norman? 

I'm postive a few of these ques- 
tions have been bothering other fans 
and I'm sure they'll be glad to read 
the answers. 

No matter what anybody says, If 
is the best magazine on the market.

Dear Editor: 

Re: Max H. Flindt's article {The 
Food of Mara) pidnted in the Octo- 
ber issue of If. Mr. Plindt states: 
‘^No other agency whether nati^al, 
animal or insect has ever made a 
network of lines to compare with 
the map of the canal systems of 
Mars." I contest thikt; think of the 
forces of nature that formed the 
Andes or better yet the gigantic rain 
forests of Soutii America or the 
Congo. Nothing that man has done 
compares with such a project as 
that that the buildinig of the Martian 
canals would entail. The Martian 
"canals" are, most likely, strips of 
vegetation (lichen would be my 
guess) that grow and shrink with 
the seasons. 

This theory is supported by the 
fact that the smallestf "detail" that 
we can see on Mars would have to 
be at least 150 miles in diameter. 
Only a plant spread (such as a rain 
forest) would fit all the qualifica- 
tions for a Martian "canal". Water 
is fed to it through natural chan- 
nels; remember the Mississippi 
would be invisible to us there. Fr^k 
water reflection would account for 
the "canals" being blue that once 
(sure the mathematics are against 
it, the mathematics are against you 



being alive to read this. Besides, 
who's going to build a 160 mile 
wide canal? Wanna argue?). I vote 
for lichen las the culprit plant as 
all of the evidence is in its favor. 
What do you say? 

And while I'm at it, why do you 
persist in placing ads in which you 
"cut out the coupon" in such a man- 
ner as to force you to ruin either 
the cover or the opening page to a 
story. It's ridiculous. No sf fan will 
wantonly mutilate an sf magazine 
that he doesn't have at least two of. 
And put a Hue and Cry section in 
Galaxy while you're at it. You can’t 
have too many letters from interest- 
ed readers! — Scott Beavers, 2313 
Sunrise Ave., Modesto Calif.

Dear Editor: 

I have been a reader of SF since 
I was a freshman in high school and 
I've been reading If for two years 
now. If has presented some really 
great novels, such as Skylark Du-- 
Queane, Relief a War and The 
Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, as well 
as skillions of short stories and 
novelettes. I think, however, that the 
most absolutely gripping story 
you've ever printed, at least to my 
knowledge, is Faust Aleph-Null, by 
Algis Budrys.* I heartily endorse 
your new "policy” of printing, sci- 
ence-fanstasy as well as straight 
SF. I enjoyed Andre Norton's 
novelette and was half scared out of 
my wits by the end of Faust Aleph- 
Null. I usually stick to the straight 
stuff, but Conan and the Witch- 
World can turn me on too. 

Keep up the good work, Herr Edi- 
tor I — Stephen Noe '71, Room 141,
