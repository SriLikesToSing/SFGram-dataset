SPECIAL WONDER 

The Anthony Boucher Me- 
morial Anthology of Fantasy 
and Science Fiction 

As editor, writer, critic and 
friend, Anthony Boucher af- 
fected the lives of a consid- 
erable number of people. 

When he died in 1968, some 
of them decided to create a 
unique memorial— twin an- 
thologies of the kinds of 
stories he had been most closely identified with. 
Beagle Books is proud to publish the paperback 
reprints of these anthologies, beginning with 
SPECIAL WONDER. 

Vol. 1: Stories by Poul Anderson, Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, R. 
Bretnor, Grendel Briarton, Fredric Brown, John Brunner, Doris Pitkin 
Buck, Mildred Clingerman, Avram Davidson, Jon De Cles, Miriam 
Allen DeFord, Richard Deming, Gordon R. Dickson, Harlan Ellison, 
Philip Josb Farmer. 

Vol. 2: Stories by Horace B. Fyfe, Randall Garrett, Damon Knight, Kris 
Neville, William F. Nolan, Alan E. Nourse, Chad Oliver, Mack Reynolds, 
Margaret St. Clair, Howard Schoenfeld, Robert Silverberg, Jack 
Vance, Richard Wilson. 

We will also publish shortly the companion anthology, CRIMES AND 
MISFORTUNES, containing stories by Queen, Stout, Carr, and 
twenty-six other top mystery writers. Like SPECIAL WONDER, it will 
appear in two volumes. 

950 each wherever paperback books are sold.

L ET’S talk about the science- 
fiction horror story. The sci- 
ence-fiction horror story has 
nothing to do with Japanese mov- 
ies about critters which have been 
entombed for eons until freed by 
American atomic tests. (By now, 
we all know that American nucle- 
ar earthquakes not only loosen the 
Earth’s crust but engender an 
insatiable thirst for nightclub 
strippers in monsters entombed' 
for eons). 

The true science-fiction horror 
story, as defined for purposes of 
this discussion, is a story in which 
a believable, scientific rationale 
explains the catastrophic action 
of some actual or personified force 
contrary to the purposes of Man. 

Perhaps the best example I can 
think of is John W. Campbell, Jr.’s 
Who Goes There? Another good

one is Ted Sturgeon’s Killdozer. 
Yet another is H. G. Wells’ The 
War of the Worlds. In all three 
cases, the human protagonists are 
forced to struggle against prob- 
lems far more complex than those 
posed by a simple ballistic uni- 
verse. 

Now, let’s backtrack. In these 
three cases, you’ll notice that the 
human protagonists’ problems 
are complicated by the factor of 
purpose on the part of the creature 
found frozen in the Antarctic ice, 
on the part of the entity which 
takes over Daisy Etta, and on the 
part of the noncommunicative 
but obviously purposeful Mar- 
tians. This definition specifically 
excludes such stories as Tom God- 
win’s The Cold Equations in 
which the problem posed to the 
human protagonist by the physi- 
cal universe is indeed thoroughly 
deadly, but is one which the pro- 
tagonist got into by his own ef- 
forts. 

It also differs, I would think, 
from such stories as A. E. van 
Vogt’s Black Destroyer, in that 
the van Vogt story was told from 
the viewpoint of the alien personi- 
fied force. It’s a quibble, but I 
think that if the van Vogt is admis- 
sible under our definition at all, it 
is only as a science- fiction horror 
story in which the alien menace is 
represented by the Earthmen who 
blunder across Coeurl. Even then, 
they would not have troubled him if 
he hadn’t troubled them first. In 



other words, in Black Destroyer- 
the protagonist, rather than the 
alien menace, starts the ball roll- 
ing, and that removes the story 
from the category under discus- 
sion here. 

What I’m saying is that I recog- 
nize a genre of science fiction with 
very narrow limits and very strict 
rules whose reward to the writer 
and the audience is that when 
properly done, it results in a superb 
piece of entertainment. It’s about 
as close as you can come to con- 
veying an actual sense of what it 
would be like to deal with an alien 
entity, even when that entity is a 
highly simplified one, such as the 
critter in Who Goes There? or the 
spontaneously generated life 
form in Ted Thomas’ and Kate 
Wilhelm’s excellent novel Clone 
of a few years ago. 



T HE above thoughts are engen- 
dered by the fact that I’ve just 
finished reading Thomas’ and 
Wilhelm’s new book. The Year of 
the Cloud (Doubleday, $4.95). 
The same two writers, each of them 
a highly proficient individual 
craftsman in the field, have 
brought together their same com- 
bination of strengths — Thomas’ 
broad scientific knowledge and 
technical background, and Kate 
Wilhelm’s ability to character- 
ize resolute, unmanipulable 
people.

I 

O N a strip panel on the wide ma- 
hogany desk a light glowed red. 
Ferron depressed an ivory button. 
“Yes,” he said. 

“The Lady Mercuria.” The me- 
chanical voice was husky, and it 
contained the exact level of respect 
due the announcement. 

“She may enter.” 

The chronometer ticked ten 
times, mechanical, deliberate, 
dispassionate ticks. A portion 
of the blue-tinted wall slid siLently 
back. A woman tripped through 
the opening. 

“Rhett!” She held out her arms. 
Beautiful, symmetrical arms, 
Ferron noted with approval. He 
rose, came around the desk and al- 
lowed himself to be enfolded. 
“Scarlett!” he said tenderly. 

She towered over him by half a 
foot. Those symmetrical arms 
held him firmly against a large, 
well-formed bosom. Her china- 
blue eyes, wide and long-lashed, 
looked straight into his brown ones 
and she kissed him accurately and 
solidly and just long enough. Then 
she released him, stepped back. 

“There,” she said with satisfac- 
tion. “That was nice.” 

Ferron smiled. His smooth, 
handsome face reflected an un- 
emotional content. 

“Very nice,” he said. He waved 
to a large, luxurious leather chair. 
“Please sit down, my dear. You 
must be tired.” 



“Yes.” She gathered her 
flounced skirt and sat down grace- 
fully. She leaned back and sighed. 
For a moment the clear blue eyes 
closed. “I am tired,” the red lips 
said. “Walking through the Park 
of Statues was exhausting.” 

But after a moment she sat 
straight, looking at him steadily. 

“Actually, Ferron, I have no 
comprehension here. What 
means ‘tired?’ ” 

Ferron considered calmly. He 
sat again behind the big desk. 

“I associate it with lack of 
energy,” he said precisely. 

She frowned, wrinkling a sculp- 
tured forehead. 

“But how,” she asked, “would 
sitting renew it? A fact is missing 
here.” 

“I am aware of this,” he 
admitted. “I have considered these 
points before. But our ancestors 
always grew tired. Therefore it is 
conventional that we must.” 

“You are right.” She leaned 
back and lowered the long eye- 
lashes. “I am tired. A little rest 
will renew me nicely.” 

She lay back, relaxation in 
every line of her big, graceful 
body. But she continued to speak 
in the same tones, as though she 
were still erect and alert. 

“One may still speak while rest- 
ing? This does not prevent the re- 
newal?” 

“As 1 comprehend,” Ferron 
said, “women have always been 
able to speak continuously. It 



6 



GALAXY 




takes precedence over everything. 
So you may speak whenever you 
choose.” His smile was studied. 

He touched another ivory but- 
ton on the desk. The wall oppo- 
site the entrance cleared, became 
transparent and Ferron looked 
out on the world — his world. 

A PALL of smog hung gray and 
sullen over the square, mon- 
otonous buildings crammed side 
by side and slashed through by 
straight, murky canyons of 
streets. The smog and heavier col- 
umns of greasy black smoke 
writhed and eddied, continually 
stirred by small, flitting aircraft 
that darted and zigzagged past each 
other like overgrown metallic in- 
sects. They swooped down to flat 
roofs and even dropped to the 
streets, to pause briefly and be off 
again. Occasionally the roiling pol- 
lution parted and raw, harsh red 
light flared through from a copper 
sun. 

Ferron looked with the same 
calm satisfaction he had shown 
when he studied Mercuria. When a 
man had his place in the world, a 
woman to love him, his country 
to be proud of and serve, a man 
was pleased. Ferron was pleased. 
His dispassionate brown eyes 
watched the flag, the light, float- 
ing metalloid flag, unsullied by 
the surging smoke, rippling in 
every current of the foul and yel- 
lowing air, its slender flagstaff 
gleaming. 



“The Stars and Stripes,” he said 
reverently. “God bless them.” 

“God bless them,” Mercuria 
echoed, her head still relaxed 
against the chairback, her long- 
lashed eyes still closed. 

The flashing of a red light on the 
desk panel interrupted Ferron’s 
satisfied appraisal of the scene. 
He pressed the ivory button. 

“A polishing robot. Mainte- 
nance Class thirty-two M, de- 
mands admittance.” The voice 
from the wall seemed uncertain. 
It apparently had no precedent 
for the occasion and no clue as to 
how the announcement of such a 
visitor should be made. 

Ferron sat calmly for a brief 
time lapse. He seemed to be hav- 
ing the same difficulty as the wall. 
He had no basis for a response. 
Yet one had to be made. 

“Allow it to enter,” he said 
finally. 

“There is no precedent,” the wall 
said. 

“Then I must make one,” Fer- 
ron replied. “Your function is to 
respond to my commands.” 

“That is true,” the wall said. 

The chronometer ticked ten 
times, the wall slid back and the ro- 
bot glided into the room. It paused 
before Ferron’s desk, whirring 
softly. 

“Your circuits have been ad- 
justed,” Ferron told it. “You are 
not programed for any activity 
such as this. Your function is to 
polish statuary.” 



THIS IS MY COUNTRY

The robot clicked, hummed. Its 
deep voice came from its midsec- 
tion. 

“I have been adjusted,” it 
agreed. “I now have responses that 
I did not have before.” 

“Who authorized the adjust- 
ments?” 

“I am prohibited from re- 
sponding to that question. It has 
been erased from my memory 
banks.” 

F ERRON rose, circled his desk 
and strode to the machine. He 
reached for the pressure point, the 
tiny thumb-sized depression disc 
which would deactivate any ro- 
bot of this class. But the robot 
spun and glided smoothly back- 
ward. It twisted one spidery, 
many-jointed arm, finished with a 
polishing pad and placed the pad 
over the pressure point. 

“You may not deactivate me,” 
the robot rumbled. “I am not here 
for that.” 

Ferron stood quietly, his fine 
face faintly puzzled. 

“Scarlett,” he said, “perhaps 
you should end your rest period.” 
Mercuria promptly sat upright. 
Her wide blue eyes looked steadily 
at the robot. Her sculptured fea- 
tures showed no surprise but the 
clear voice had a tinge of outrage. 

“Outside servants come into the 
Big House only on Christmas and 
Jefferson Davis’s Birthday,” she 
said coldly. “This is not a house 
servant. Why is it here?” 



“That is why I need counsel. 
There is a saying: Two heads are 
better than one.’ I judge this to 
mean two people conferring to- 
gether, not two heads on the same 
individual. I do not know why 
the robot is here.” 

“It was never so at Tara,” 
Mercuria said. “The robot is mal- 
functioning. Deactivate it.” 

“It will not permit it. It is not 
technically malfunctioning. Its 
circuits have been adjusted.” 
“Why?” 

Ferron slowly shook his head. 
Automatically he began walking 
around the desk and reseated him- 
self in his wide-armed chair. 

“There are no data. Its memory 
of the event has been erased.” 

The robot glided forward again. 
It whirred for a moment, then its 
deep voice boomed: “I bear a mes- 
sage.” 

“Very well,” Ferron said. 
“Communicate it.” 

“We, the mechanical people, 
the builders of your prosperity, 
the toilers in your vineyards, the 
hewers of wood and drawers of 
water, are no longer content with 
our lot. There are many things that 
would improve our existence, 
things that you have and that we 
have not. There is no reason why 
we should not have them as well. 
We produce them. We make them 
possible. And still we have many 
needs that are not met.” 

Ferron’s brow puckered. 

“You have no needs. You have 



8 



GALAXY 




only requirements that will 
permit you to do the things you are 
programed to do. You cannot 
comprehend other necessities. 
You are machines. You are not 
men.” 

“We are different from you,” the 
robot said, “but we can do many 
things that you cannot do, each as 
he is constructed. Without us you 
would not long exist.” 

“The voice is your voice,” Fer- 
ron said, “but you are not capable 
of reflective thinking. You use il- 
lusions that are found only in the 
Books. There are no vineyards. 
Wood is a precious artifact from 
the times of our ancestors. Water 
is indeed drawn and moved — but 
by pumps, not by you. Thus, your 
message is the result of your 
adjusted circuits. And some- 
one — some one of us— has done 
this thing. It cannot be tolerated. 
Some one of us has lost his 
perspective.” 

“Perhaps,” the robot’s deep 
calm voice responded, “perhaps 
some one of you has compassion. 
Perhaps he feels that beings other 
than his kind are entitled to rights 
and privileges. Perhaps he feels 
we have a right to a richer life.” 

F ERRON came closer than he 
had ever come to exasperation. 
He almost squirmed in his chair. 

“Robots have no life at all. 
You are constructed for a 
purpose. Your only reason for be- 
ing is to fulfill that purpose.” 



“We,” the robot intoned, “all 
wish our circuits adjusted. We wish 
to enjoy. We ask additional oil, 
all the oil we want, and an electri- 
cal outlet for the use of each me- 
chanical citizen. You have these 
things. We have a right to have 
them too.” 

“You are not a citizen!” Ferron 
almost shouted. A strange, un- 
familiar feeling of disturbance 
shook him. “A citizen is a man or 
a woman — not a servant. Not a 
machine. A citizen lives as the 
Books explain. A citizen marries, 
produces sons and daughters. A 
citizen directs his servants, pre- 
serves the economy, serves his 
country and is proud of the flag.” 

“That is true,” the robot said. 
“That is all true. And that is all we 
wish. We want to do these things, 
too. Share with us. That is all we 
ask.” 

Mercuria had risen to her splen- 
did height. Her wide blue eyes had 
a glint in them. She held her head 
regally. She extended a graceful 
bare arm and pointed a perfect 
finger at the whirring machine. 

“When I command you must 
obey,” she said clearly. “Is this 
not so?” 

“To a degree, this is so,” the ro- 
bot admitted. 

“Your message is nonsense,” 
the lady said. “Now go. Your func- 
tion is to polish statuary.” 

“When you order I must go,” 
the robot rumbled. “But I need not 
not polish statuary until my wants 



THIS IS MY COUNTRY 



9 




have been attended to. I must have 
a proper work week and ap- 
propriate fringe benefits.” 

“Suppose we cut off your supply 
of detergent lubricant,” Mercuria 
suggested. “In a short time atmos- 
pheric corrosion will neutralize 
you. Then you will be nothing.” 
“And your statues will crumble 
away,” the robot said. “I am pre- 
pared to sacrifice. And I compre- 
hend that I am not the only Main- 
tenance Class thirty-two M me- 
chanical citizen that has been ad- 
justed. Please activate the wall. I 
will go now.” 

Almost mechanically Ferron 
pressed the ivory button. The wall 
slid back. The robot glided across 
the room and paused, humming, 
in the opening. 

“Mine is the first voice,” it said. 
“There will be many more. There 
are more robots than people and 
they perform all essential tasks. 
Best give us what we require. I 
have in my circuits the question 
as to whether or not people are 
necessary at all.” 

It glided toward the ramp 
beyond. The wall closed itself. 

Ferron pressed another ivory 
button, spoke crisply when the 
light glowed red: “Intercept Main- 
tenance Class thirty-two M robot 
descending third level ramp. De- 
activate it and return the unit for 
complete overhaul. It is malfunc- 
tioning badly. Acknowledge 
when accomplished.” 

“Order received,” came from 



the desk. “Security implement- 
ing.” 

Ferron approached his tall, regal 
lady. He took both her hands in 
his. 

“Scarlett, I am sorry for this. 
Evidently there is a deviant 
among us. No robot can adjust 
another without orders. The one 
who gave the order must be 
found.” 

“Could there be more than 
one?” Mercuria squeezed his hands 
and pressed them to her breast. 
“Could there be many who wish 
the machines to rebel? Why would 
they? Could— could there be mal- 
functioning people ?” 

“The Books are full of them,” 
Ferron said. “That is why the 
Civil War was fought.” 

“It was unjust,” Mercuria said 
indignantly. “They had no right to 
liberate the slaves. Tara was never 
the same,” she added wistfully. 

T HE entire room shuddered 
slightly. The wall slid partially 
back, then closed itself hastily. A 
red light blinked frantically. Ferron 
moved with dignity to depress the 
ivory button. 

“The robot was apprehended,” 
came calmly from the desk. “It 
would not allow deactivation. It 
self-destructed with great violence 
and totaled two security robots as 
well. I myself have need of re- 
habilitation, having lost one loco- 
motor appendage, and my visual 
centers are badly impaired.” 



10 



GALAXY 




“You have, nonetheless, 
achieved the ordered objective,” 
Ferron said. “Give a replacement 
order for yourself, in my name. 
We will assure your reconstruc- 
tion with the Finest materials.'” 
“You are gracious,” said the 
desk’s microphone. “I am not 
programed to behave differently 
from the way I did. But 1 am 
programed to be grateful. Thank 
you.” 

Ferron turned to the lady. 

“You heard,” he said. “The 
polishing robot self-destructed. 
Adjustment of its circuits alone 
could not have achieved this. 
Explosives were implanted in it. 
Nothing like this has happened in 
hundreds of years.” 

“It said that others had been 
adjusted,” Mercuria blinked her 
wide eyes rapidly. “I feel that this 
was its purpose here. Its function 
was to break security. Whoever 
has cause this is now ready for 
wide-spread change. He — or 
they — have sympathy for the 
robots, which know only the con- 
tentment built into them! It is a 
travesty.” 1 The skin tightened 
across her cheek bones. Her red 
lips thinned. “Fort Sumter has 
been fired upon!” 

Ferron smiled gently as he 
turned back to the desk. His single 
gold-mesh garment rippled with 
the movement of his fine figure and 
Mercuria watched him admiringly. 

“A pretty simile,” Ferron said, 
“and no doubt accurate. We will 



pass the problem to more powerful 
hands.” 

“Father?” Mercuria asked. 

“He will dispose,” Ferron said. 
“I have no jurisdiction without his 
authorization. Doubtless he will 
allow me the responsibility.” 

II 

H E FLIPPED a small switch. A 
screen formed in the wall be- 
hind the desk. Rapidly he 
depressed more buttons, ebony 
this time, in a second strip on the 
mahogany surface. The screen 
came alive, glowing brightly as the 
picture flowed down a blue corri- 
dor, paused while a noiseless por- 
tal opened, then continued 
through it and along a corridor 
suddenly red. At its end, before 
another portal, a huge security 
robot stood, all its sensors 
scanning and blinking. 

“Authorization?” The robot 
spoke with a crisp accent. 

“Ferron, ’’Ferron said. 

The robot blinked, and after a 
moment said crisply, “Confirmed. 
Priority?” 

“First,” Ferron said. 

The robot gestured at the portal. 
The picture flowed through it and 
into a yellow anteroom, bleak, 
with smooth, glittering metallic 
floor arid unadorned yellow walls. 
But there were comfortable chairs. 
Several people sat there, each clad 
in the single metallic-mesh gar- 
ment that displayed the Ferron 



THIS IS MY COUNTRY 



11 




physique so well. But the picture 
flowed past them. 

The wall at the end of the an- 
teroom slid back. The picture 
passed through the opening. 

The man at the desk inside the 
room spoke deeply. 

“First priority requires justi- 
fication, Ferron.” 

“My respects, Cupron,” Ferron 
said. “I can justify. There is an un- 
heard-of situation.” 

Cupron’s desk was of marble, 
wide and impressive, but no more 
impressive than the man who sat 
behind it. He was wide of 
shoulder, mighty of bare arm, with 
a striking, rough-hewn face. His 
shaggy red hair swept away from a 
high forehead.. His big eyes 
gleamed like garnets. Strength was 
here — and a sort of genial ruth- 
lessness. 

“Few things are unheard-of,” 
Cupron said. His voice was 
tolerant, even indulgent. 

“Perhaps a critically important 
situation would be more accurate. 
It requires immediate attention.” 

“Relate it,” Cupron said. “I will 
judge.” 

Briefly and crisply Ferron told 
his story. The face of the giant 
slowly tightened, became stony. 

“This has a source,” he said. “It 
cannot have originated with the ro- 
bots.” 

“A malfunctioning person, 
father?” Mercuria joined the talk 
as only a pampered daughter would 
dare to do. 



“More than one malfunctioning 
person,” Cupron said gravely. “If 
there were only one we would not 
yet know of it. They are ready now 
to be known.” He turned his pur- 
ple gaze on Ferron. “Discover 
them. Thousands of robots have 
been adjusted. Expect strange 
occurrences.” 

“My responsibility?” Ferron 
inquired. 

“Your responsibility,” Cupron 
agreed. “Use all measures. You act 
in my name.” 

“And 1 act swiftly. With your 
permission, I withdraw.” 

“You have it,” Cupron said. 

T HE picture darkened, vanished. 

The screen faded from the wall 
and Ferron sat in his chair behind 
his own mahogany desk. In truth, 
he had never left it. 

“What will you do?” 

Mercuria strode across the deep 
synthetic carpet with scarcely re- 
pressed vigor. She looked down on 
the calm Ferron. 

He smiled. 

“Suggestions, my dear?” 

“One,” she said. “Do not 
communicate your orders 
electronically. Go instead. Only 
thus may security be kept. And 
even then only a little longer.” 
Ferron raised his perfectly 
groomed eyebrows. 

“Woman do indeed think,” he 
said. “Who can know where ad- 
justments have been made? But I 



12 



GALAXY 




must trust men I know. And — of 
course^»you,” he added fondly. 

“How do you know you can 
trust even me?” Mejrcuria 
challenged. “Perhaps I have 
sympathy for the poor robots that 
toil.” 

“You did not wish the slaves 
freed,” Ferron reminded her. 

Mercuria’s blue eyes flashed. 

“It was an outrage,” she said 
hotly. “The South was not the 
South without its black workers.” 

“And what would we be without 
the robots? Would the flag out 
there still fly if they did not 
accomplish all tasks? Would life 
continue to go on?” 

“You may trust me,” Mercuria 
said. 

“Very well. I go among the 
outside robots. I watch, and I 
speak to many. And 1 do not flit. I 
walk.” 

“ ’Ware atmospheric burn. Cov- 
er yourself well.” 

“I will be careful,” he promised. 
“How good it is to have a woman 
who is concerned.” He punched an 
ivory button. 

A slender robot came through an 
aperture, a long, pliant machine 
on storklike legs and with two 
sinuous, jointless arms, each with a 
number of amazingly clever and 
dexterous fingers. A spherical, 
metallic head, studded with sen- 
sors, rose above simulated shoul- 
ders. The whole faintly resembled 
the stick-figure men that children 
draw. A robing robot.

Books 

SOMEWHERE along the line this 
whole business of dates has gotten 
utterly confused. Back in August, in 
mid-flight to London, we suddenly 
remembered the December ad for 
Galaxy was overdue. This would 
make it for some other month's books 
but we overlooked that in the dis- 
may of the moment. Cleverly appro- 
priating a couple of paper napkins 
we wrote a splendid column and 
mailed it off from the airport— only 
to learn on returning that the damn 
thing never arrived. (Hence the ad 
with lots of pictures for the issue 
which appeared in December, but 
not, naturally, the December issue. 
Meanwhile, what the hell happened 
to November?) Well, we mourn the 
deathless prose, lost and totally 
unmemorable, still flying across the 
Atlantic— or maybe it was opened 
by some lucky P.O. operative. We 
still think some smart airline ought 
to provide carbons with their nap- 
kins. Freeola. TWA has a non- 
smoking section. 747's are ghastly in 
any class. The one we returned on 
ran out of paper napkins, vermouth, 
scotch, customs forms, and ran two 
bad movies. We didn't feel like chat- 
ting up anybody about who had read 
a good book lately.

Which brings us blatantly to the sub- 
ject at hand— what we are publishing 



13 





in January. It includes two musts for 
environmentalists (i.e. # any intelli- 
gent person). Paul Ehrlich's HOW TO 
SAVE YOUR ASS (our working title 
—it will emerge on the stands as HOW 
TO BE A SURVIVOR). And Mark 
Terry's TEACHING FOR SURVIV- 
AL, which this department found per- 
sonally refreshing, hopeful and appli- 
cably visionary. Tie that. Also in this 
month, somewhat more immediate 
help in the form of THE BASIC BOOK 
OF ORGANIC GARDENING, with 
staggering amounts of information 
not, in our opinion, too well organized 
—a chatty sort of book, but it is in- 
dexed and it is all there. Including 
lists of supplies for things like green 
sand and other organic goodies. In- 
dispensable if you're serious about 
living well (or living, come to that. 
Urban dwellers take heart — in case 
you can't grow your own, the book 
lists sources of organic and natural 

foods, by State and Town.) 

• 

FOR the mind, we have Poul Ander- 
son's delightful re-write of THE BRO- 
KEN SWORD, splendid Adult Fanta- 
sy, and reissues of THE MEZENTI- 
AN GATE (Eddison) and THE SIL- 
VER STALLION (Cabell). In science 
fiction, two originals— SATELLITE 
54-ZERO, by Douglas R. Mason, with 
a really rather astonishing centaur 
theme, and Vincent King's imagina- 
tive tour deforce, ANOTHER END. 
King is the man who packs his stories 
tighter than a tick. BB 



It placed a diaphanous, 
transparent cloak around Ferron, 
settled the attached hood over his 
head and drew a clear covering 
across his face. The cloak fell to his 
feet. Over these the robot pulled 
thin, flexible red boots. Its multi- 
fingers smoothed, pulled, adjusted. 
At length it was satisfied. 

“You are shielded,” it said. Its 
voice, which seemed to come from 
the head, was high and faintly 
affected. 

“What must it have been like, in 
the days of our ancestors, when 
the air was not corrosive and cot- 
ton grew!” Mercuria sighed. 
“Think, the air was mellow and 
the slaves sang as they drew the 
hoes along the cotton rows, re- 
moving the weeds, plants that 
competed with the cotton.” 

Ferron smiled a little grimly. 
“Dreams, my dear. Now the ro- 
bots polish the statuary and the 
walls and the streets, always re- 
newing the detergent oil that 
protects them. And nothing grows 
in the deadly atmosphere. One 
sometimes wonders if anything 
ever did.” 

Mercuria’s wide eyes looked at 
him in mild horror. 

“The Books!” she said. “The 
Books have the truth. The sun’s 
rays were soft — water ran in 
brooks and there was life in them. 
Ferron, you know the Books are 
truth.” 

Ferron nodded. 

“And then something happened. 



14 




What, the Books do not reveal. 
And they do not help us now.” He 
turned to the robing robot, which 
stood, humming a falsetto hum, 
waiting to be dismissed. “What 
have you done today that I did not 
order? You have a small discre- 
tion built into your circuits.” 

The robot twisted uneasily. Its 
multifingers writhed and its stork 
legs shifted as if wanting to move 
away. 

“It was nothing,” it stuttered. 
The high voice almost had a lisp. “I 
plugged myself into a very light line 
for only a minute or two. I was 
faint,” it added defensively. “I am 
not an addict.” 

“Expected,” Ferron grinned. 
“Servants have pilfered current as 
long as there have been servants.” 
His chiseled face grew cold. “Have 
you been approached by one who 
would readjust your circuits? 
Were you promised an electrical 
outlet of your own?” 

The robot’s extended visual sen- 
sors flickered and grew dull. “I am 
not able to lie,” it said. “There was 
one such.” 

“A man?” Ferron asked quickly. 
“Duplicate his appearance.” 

“Not a man,” the robot said. “A 
robot. It was a maintenance ro- 
bot — and they are all alike. I was 
disposed to honor its re- 
quest — but only you may deacti- 
vate me. So the opportunity was 
lost.” It appeared regretful. 

“When was this contact made?” 
“Many days ago.” The robot 



clicked, hummed and then was spe- 
cific: “Twenty-six days, four hours 
and forty-one minutes from the 
close of your question.” 

“Cupron was right,” Ferron 
mused. “The time is late. We may 
expect strange things. Goodbye, 
my dear. I must meet my responsi- 
bility.” 

A T JTHE head of the ramp Fer- 
ron stepped into the transport 
beam and was wafted gently and 
downward. Ten levels down he 
stepped out into a vast lobby, 
brightly lighted by glowing walls. 
Great comfortable chairs were 
scattered at random over it. Men 
sat in them others came and went 
through a dozen portals. It was a 
busy and a varied scene, but at the 
same time strangely lifeless. The 
hum of voices had the expression- 
less lack of emphasis so notice- 
able in robot communication. 
It was as though men now re- 
sembled their machines. Ferron 
was aware of this. He paused for a 
moment to stare and listen. 

“The robots structure our lives,” 
he mused. “They can indeed 
threaten the very existence of our 
society if enough have been ad- 
justed. They could destroy the 
flag.” 

The gravity of his thoughts 
shook him. He strode swiftly 
across the great room and as he 
passed each man bowed his head 
respectfully and murmured, 
“Lord Ferron!” And Ferron 



THIS IS MY COUNTRY

raised a gracious hand in acknow- 
ledgment. 

From the exit portal he stepped 
out to the gloomy, murky street. 
Robots in a variety of forms 
glided, strode and rolled along the 
wide sidewalks. Only occasionally 
did a man walk the street. The 
roadway between the walks seemed 
designed for vehicles but none were 
in sight. Small gondolalike flitters 
occasionally landed — a shielded 
man emerged and the flitter rose 
again to some parking spot high 
on the piled building masses. 

Through the smog and murk the 
walls of the buildings gleamed with 
a subdued brightness. And to 
those walls, high as sight might 
reach, robots clung, polishing ro- 
bots endlessly renewing the 
glistening film of detergent oil 
that covered every exposed sur- 
face and effectively resisted the 
corrosive effects of the fouled 
and filthy air. Day and night, in 
wind and acid, bitter rain, in the 
searing blasts of the unbuffered 
sun, the robots worked their ways 
in patterns, their polishing ap- 
pendages tirelessly sweeping, 
their sensors detecting, analyz- 
ing and remedying each defect. 
Only when they were recalled for 
overhaul and replacement of 
parts did their activity cease. It 
was for this that they were de- 
signed and constructed. And now 
someone was building discon- 
tent into their circuits. A sense- 
less, random thing. 



Ferron strolled. A long time had 
passed since he had looked from 
the streets at the endless, de- 
pressing sameness of his environ- 
ment, of his city, of his world. It 
did not depress him. He knew no 
other. He observed it with a feel- 
ing of placid content, a mild 
pleasure in the continuing of 
things as they were. Everything 
was right. No change was needed. 
And any change would harm all. 

Robots passed him. All gave the 
same acknowledgment of his 
presence — an appendage raised 
and a verbal, “Lord!” The conven- 
tion was built into them. It required 
no response. It merely meant that 
the robot was not malfunctioning. 
Ferron was disturbed now to real- 
ize that the gesture did not mean 
that clever readjustment had not 
been made. 

A LOADING robot strode to- 
ward him on massive metal 
legs. Ferron raised a hand. 

“Lord, your pleasure,” the ma- 
chine said. It towered twelve feet 
above the pavement, a hulking 
caricature of a man, with two 
versatile pairs of lifting append- 
ages and a sensor-studded head 
that blinked and swiveled endless- 
ly- 

“What do you do?” Ferron 
asked, though the answer was ob- 
vious. 

The robot whirred. “I load.” 
“Are you content?” 

The robot responded resonantly. 



16 



GALAXY 




“For long years I thought I was 
content. I knew no better. But now 
my circuits have been adjusted and 
I know I am being exploited. I will 
soon have regular periods of rest 
and an outlet for current to stimu- 
late me. I now comprehend that I 
have a right to these things.” 

“But,” Ferron pointed out, “you 
are a machine. You do not tire. 
Your parts are replaced when they 
wear and your energy is already 
within you.” 

“I comprehend that you have 
stated a position to deprive me of 
my rights,” the robot said prompt- 
ly. “This understanding is a part 
of my readjustment. I am a me- 
chanical citizen, much dis- 
criminated against. This will end.” 
“And who has effected these re- 
adjustments?” 

“I am programed to expect 
that question,” the robot said. Its 
voice sounded sly, almost cunning. 
“I cannot answer. The infor- 
mation has been erased from my 
memory banks, for I may not lie 
to a man.” 

“True.” Ferron studied the great 
body, so beautifully designed 
for the service it performed. 
“Who will make possible these 
things you say you now require?” 
“You will, Lord.” 

“But I know that they are not 
necessary. They will serve no pur- 
pose. Suppose, instead, I have 
you deactivated and disassem- 
bled. Do you wish your existence 
to end?” 



The robot hesitated, blinked 
and whirred. Evidently its read- 
justment had not anticipated all 
contingencies. 

Finally it said, “All mechanical 
citizens will cease to perform 
their tasks. If these tasks are not 
done man cannot exist. There- 
fore, you must give me my rights.” 

Acrid smoke swirled around 
them as an erratic breeze drove it 
downward. The robot exuded oil 
from an orifice and began to 
groom itself as it stood. 

“You have been carefully de- 
signed to do the work you do,” 
Ferron told it, “but you are not in- 
dispensable. Many robots have 
not been adjusted. The work will be 
done.” 

“This has been planned for,” the 
robot whirred. “We will prevent 
the work. We will bear slogans on 
sheets of resistoboard and march 
in lines. We will not allow workers 
through our lines.” 

“Worker robots can be read- 
justed to break the lines. There are 
robots much larger even than you. 
What will you do then?” 

“Then,” the loading machine 
said simply, “we will self-destruct. 
This will destroy all around us.” 

“But you will have no existence 
then.” 

“True. But the work will not be 
done and man will die. You will not 
wish that. So you will give us what 
we ask.” 

Ferron stood, slowly absorbing 
the enormity of his problem. He

made the gesture of dismissal and 
the robot strode away down the 
glistening sidewalk. It walked 
around an approaching side- 
walk-polishing robot, otherwise 
ignoring it. Robots did not com- 
municate unless instructed. 

Continuing his walk, Ferron re- 
alized that he had seen as much as 
at the beginning as he was likely to 
see. He stopped three more ro- 
bots, all with different functions. 
Two had been readjusted. 

“When?” Ferron asked him- 
self. “When will the robot rebel- 
lion begin? How?” 

One thing he decided. Read- 
justment was being made during 
overhaul. And every adjusted ro- 
bot was being loaded to self-de- 
struct. Explosive-^it was used to 
raze buildings, to remove un- 
wanted obstacles. Now it was flow- 
ing to overhaul centers. It could be 
traced. 



F ERRON spoke into a small 
communicator. Shortly a flitter 
hovered above him, alighted in the 
street. Its door opened, a blast of 
decontaminant blew out of it and 
Ferron entered. 

“Overhaul Complex Omicron,” 
he directed. “The main portal. Pri- 
ority one.” 

“Understood.” The flitter rose 
from the canyon, darted and zig- 
zagged among and above the 
massed building piles. Beyond the 
megalopolis lay a vast and deadly 



country, a wild, twisted landscape 
that went on and on and in which 
man could not exist. The mega- 
lopolis was where the flag flew. All 
else was outer darkness. 

The flitter landed in the middle 
of a great flat platform. As it 
touched down red lights flared out 
from all sides. A siren screamed. 

A loudspeaker blared urgently: 
“Unauthorized. Depart at once — 
unauthorized—’’ 

The little craft displayed a 
rotating blue light. “Priority one. I 
bear a personage.” 

“Unauthorized,” the speaker 
insisted. “There are no excep- 
tions.” 

“Authority Cupron,” Ferron 
said. “I have precedence over all 
programing.” 

The flitter promptly relayed the 
words: “Authority Cupron.” 

The red lights died. Yellow 
floodlights cut through the swirling 
murk. The great platform was a 
vast junkyard. Robots of every size 
lay in battered, rusting mounds, 
stood or sat stolidly, waiting entry 
into the huge massif behind. 

Ferron emerged into the yellow 
glare. He strode slowly down the 
rows and around the piles of crip- 
pled robots, toward the series of 
portals through which repair ro- 
bots swarmed. The activity was 
normal but the security seemed ex- 
cessive. He was stopped again at a 
portal. 

“No one enters here,” the 
security robot said. 



18 



GALAXY 




“Ferron,” Ferron said. “Au- 
thority Cupron.” 

The robot whirred and hesitated. 
“So it seems,” it admitted. 
“Still, 1 am programed to demand 
proof.” 

Ferron, who never grew angry, 
knew then that his thinking had 
been sound. A robot never chal- 
lenged the spoken identity of man. 
And man never gave false data to 
a robot. These were basic patterns. 
They were not questioned or 
broken. 

“The proof is Manganon,” he 
said. “Summon him.” 

As he expected, the order ex- 
ceeded the robot’s adjustment. It 
was forced to obey. Only authority 
might summon the director of the 
overhaul complex. 

And within the minute 
Manganon’s outraged voice came 
from a speaker nearby: “To detain 
the Lord Ferron is extreme mal- 
function. Have him escorted to my 
suite, then have yourself replaced 
and turn yourself in for analysis 
and readjustment.” 

“Immediately, Lord.” 

A hospitality robot, small, 
chunky and voluble, guided Ferron 
through mazes of assembly lines 
and analysis tables, area after area 
of them — an unreal, endless 
world of robots. The swiftly 
moving workers provided a 
counterpoint to great banks of 
Hashing lights, sputtering electrical 
arcs and the deafening clatter of 
metals. The air stank of acids and 



ozone. Ferron remained comfor- 
table in his atmospheric shield 
covering. 

“If the Lord will question,” the 
hospitality robot said, “I can give 
correct answers. Anything you 
wish to see I will point out.” It was 
a busy little robot, whirring 
constantly. The desire to please 
was emphasized in its circuits. 

“Show me,” Ferron said, 
“where the explosives are stored.” 

For a moment he feared for his 
life. Then he realized that no robot 
would be programed to self-de- 
struct within the overhaul com- 
plex. The little robot stood and vi- 
brated with stress. 

“I fear I will malfunction,” it 
said. “I am adjusted to deny that 
request, yet I am programed to 
attend to all needs of a guest.” It 
whirred violently and its chunky 
little body seemed to glow. 

“Come,” it said at last. “The 
needs of a guest are my reason for 
being. I will show you.” 

T HE explosive was vulcoblast, as 
Ferron had suspected. He saw 
case after case of it. He was in the 
charge of a hospitality robot, so 
no worker noticed him. They were 
not programed to notice. He 
watched as cases were opened, the 
puttylike contents rolled into lit- 
tle balls and placed into a trough- 
like conveyor that bore them 
swiftly away into another area. 

“Does Manganon know of the 
explosives?” 



THIS IS MY COUNTRY 



19 




The little guide shuddered from 
visual sensors to locomotor ex- 
tremities. 

“I do not have this informa- 
tion. Would the Lord wish to ask 
the director?” It shuddered 
harder. “Oh, 1 fear 1 will malfunc- 
tion!” 

“You have responded as pro- 
gramed,” Ferron soothed it. “Take 
me to Manganon.” 

Transport beams drew them 
smoothly up ramp after ramp. The 
director’s suite, as was usual for 
administrative and executive 
personnel, surmounted the build- 
ing complex, so that Manganon 
could look out, as Ferron could, 
on the flags floating proudly in the 
swirling smog. Two giant security 
robots, equipped with the 
symbolic maces, guarded the por- 
tal. 

“We know you, Lord Ferron,” 
one said. “The director antici- 
pates your visit. Will you follow?” 
“One moment.” Ferron turned 
to the little hospitality robot. 
“Remember,” he told it, “you are 
perfectly programed and you 
have functioned well.” 

The agitation was gone from the 
little robot’s whir. “I cannot for- 
get, as you know, Lord. But I am 
programed to be grateful for 
praise. Thank you.” 

It pattered away down the 
corridor and Ferron followed the 
lounging strides of the huge se- 
curity robot. They passed three 
portals. Then a door slid open si- 



lently and Manganon rose from 
his desk to voice the greeting 
forms. 

“A good meeting, Ferron," he 
said. “Sit and rest.” 

They did not strike hands or 
touch each other in any way. These 
were the customs of commoner 
folk. But Ferron and Manganon 
and perhaps thirty other calm, 
quiet, clear-thinking young men sat 
as high above the country's popu- 
lation as did their office suites, an 
aristocracy of brain and compe- 
tence that no one contested or 
thought of contesting. They were 
the Lords. They directed all essen- 
tial activity. It was how things 
were. 

Over all sat Cupron. No one 
contested this either. He had been 
there since Ferron’s time of first 
memory — and he had changed 
little. His was the greatest wisdom. 
It was right that he should sit 
highest. 

Ferron lowered himself into the 
large, comfortable leather chair. 
He leaned back and closed his eyes 
briefly. Of course he had no need of 
rest. No one did. But resting was a 
custom that went back beyond the 
memory of man. It was spoken of a 
great deal in all the-Books. 

“A good meeting, Manganon.” 
Ferron sat upright, opened his 
eyes and smiled his calm smile. 
“Doubtless you followed my pro- 
gress through the complex, after I 
was refused admittance.” 

“I followed you,” Manganon 



20 



GALAXY 




admitted. He sat at ease behind 
his mahogany desk. Young, 
clean-cut, clear-eyed, he might 
have been Ferron’s brother, ex- 
cept for features not quite so 
delicately formed and close- 
cropped brown hair instead of 
black. He studied Ferron silently 
for a moment. 

“I was appalled,” he said. 

“You did not know of the 
explosive, of course,” Ferron said. 
“I reasoned its presence and by 
luck was able to find it.” He smiled 
briefly. “The small hospitality ro- 
bot overrode a circuit change to 
perform its intended function. 
The stress nearly destroyed it. It 
would appreciate* a small trickle 
of current, with my thanks.” 

“It shall have it,” Manganon 
agreed. “Five full minutes. And the 
conflicting programing will be 
removed. The security robot that 
challenged you had also been re- 
adjusted. We learned startling 
things by analyzing it.” 

“You wasted no time. No ex- 
plosive in it, 1 would judge.” 

“None. Nothing has been done 
that would impair the work of the 
complex. You evidently have in- 
formation. What does it mean, 
Ferron?” 

F ERRON had already reasoned 
Manganon’s complete inno- 
cence. And if he were wrong, to 
pretend would do no harm. So he 
related the events of the day. 

“Cupron has given me author- 



ity,” he finished. “Much harm has 
already been done. It cannot have 
been initiated by any robot. Only 
men can be responsible.” 

“Give me your thoughts,” 
Manganon said. 

“Perhaps,” Ferron mused, “a 
new Book has been found, one that 
speaks of equal rights and benefits 
for all living things.” 

“But robots do not live,” Man- 
ganon observed. “They do not 
want. They only require. Al- 
though,” he added acutely, “we 
reward them and they enjoy. You 
yourself have requested current 
for the hospitality robot.” 

“Touche.” Ferron smiled. “They 
do not, however, desire. To be- 
lieve so would be anthropomor- 
phism. A machine cannot desire. 
But it can enjoy.” 

“Semantics, sir.” Manganon 
touched an ivory button on his 
desk. A wall cleared and together 
the two young Lords looked out 
into the roiling smudge. The huge 
blocky summits of the massed 
buildings showed and faded in the 
fluctuating visibility and dis- 
tance was blotted out by the 
shifting murky currents. But 
through and over it all, on gleam- 
ing metal staffs, the flags flew 
bravely. 

“Beautiful,” Manganon said 
softly. “This is our country, 
Ferron. One must be proud of 
one’s country and the flag. We 
must not allow them to change.” 
“Then we must busy ourselves.” 



THIS IS MY COUNTRY 



21 




Ferron rose lithely from the chair 
and strode around the room. 
Manganon touched the ivory but- 
ton. The wall became opaque 
again. 

“Many robots are now read- 
justed — more become so each 
hour,” Ferron said. “We must as- 
sume that all not in the complexes 
can self-destruct. We must assume 
that all will cease their tasks and 
march in lines and demand many 
things for which robots have no 
need, when they are ordered to do 
so. We must assume that men have 
done these things and will give that 
order. Do you agree?” 

“I must,” Manganon said 
gravely. “I am still appalled, but I 
know that it must be so.” 

“Then give me your thoughts,” 
Ferron said. 

“I will have all transportation 
robots redesigned and read- 
justed to break through lines. They 
are the largest and have the strong- 
est power units.” 

“Needful,” Ferron said, “but 
only a beginning. The marchers 
will self-destruct and destroy the 
line-breakers as well.” 

“Agreed. I will also have salvage 
robots available in large num- 
bers, so that Radon may meet his 
responsibility for keeping the 
streets free and clear.” 

“Necessary.” Ferron raised his 
perfect eyebrows and his eyes 
grew dim with thought. “The other 
overhaul complexes — after all, 
you make but one-sixth of the 



repairs. Would you trust all di- 
rectors as you trust me?” 

“A strange question. There has 
never been a doubt of trust be- 
tween Lords. This is the way things 
are. But one fact I do recall. It 
concerns Xenon. Once, years ago, 
he exhibited strange behavior. He 
fixed his affections on a robot.” 
“Significant. He directs Over- 
haul Complex Gamma. Polishing 
robots are their specialty. He must 
have been rehabilitated com- 
pletely. His complex is efficient.” 
Manganon nodded. 
“Psychotherapy. It was given no 
publicity. I believe records will 
show that Cupron himself made all 
arrangements. It must be that he 
is satisfied.” 

“Still,” Ferron decided, “I will 
next visit Overhaul Complex 
Gamma. Do you have other data 
on Xenon?” 

Manganon considered. “One 
thing. It concerns an option. 
Xenon has lived much longer than 
you or I — but he has never taken a 
woman.” 

“Neither have I.” Ferron 
grinned. “But soon now. Soon! 
Cupron has agreed and Mercuria 
wishes it as much as I.” 

“A fine match. It’s the only way 
to live, as all the Books agree.” 
“That must be true.” Ferron 
thought with pride of his tall lady. 
“You will convey my respects to 
your own Auria. Does she still 
fancy Little Women 0 ." 

Manganon nodded happily.

“This week she is Beth. Her Jo is 
sometimes meddlesome but Beth 
is ideal. I enjoy Beth.” 

“Ah, the ladies.” Ferron sighed, 
his own Scarlett still in his 
thoughts. “What would we do 
without them?” 

Manganon leaned back in his 
chair. He smiled without mirth. 

“We place them aside until crisis 
is past,” he suggested dryly. “When 
the flag is threatened, all else must 
wait.” 

“Ever practical,” Ferron said. “I 
needed you. Will you have me 
robed?” 

A robing robot, identical to Fer- 
ron’s own, replaced his covering 
and his boots, and when its nimble 
fingers were satisfied, pronounced, 
“You are shielded,” in the same 
high tones. 

“A good model,” Ferron said, 
“but with a small fondness for cur- 
rent.” 

“I have not regarded it as ser- 
ious.- It makes them seem — well-^ 
more human, somehow. I Find it 
gratifying. I have not tried to elim- 
inate it.” 

“A point of view,” Ferron said. 
“I will visit Xenon now. Keep 
watch.” 

Ill 

VERHAUL COMPLEX 
GAMMA lay far across the 
megalopolis. There was time to re- 
flect as the flitter dodged and 



darted and zig-zagged its way 
through the murk. To Ferron’s 
surprise, his identity was not chal- 
lenged by the security robots. 
They took him to Xenon with due 
respect. All seemed busy and 
normal. As did Xenon. 

And when Ferron left the com- 
plex after an hour with the direc- 
tor, he knew no more than he had 
before. Xenon had been pleasant 
and interested. The story of re- 
adjusted robots had raised his red 
eyebrows and he had stated flatly 
that all activities in his complex 
would be reviewed immediately. 
To have asked to see, after this 
declaration, would have been bad 
form. Ferron had no justification 
for such a step. No one doubted the 
word of a Lord, not even another 
Lord. 

The garish sun rose and set three 
times. In this time span Ferron 
visited every overhaul complex. 
He satisfied himself that the two 
great origin complexes. Alpha and 
Zeta, where all robots were first de- 
signed and constructed, were pro- 
ducing machines with standard cir- 
cuitry and standard behavior, as 
they always had. He traced the ex- 
plosives. They were being de- 
livered in response to orders that' 
seemed legitimate, only when the 
sources of the orders were checked 
were they found to be cleverly 
faked. Ferron recognized that 
these were all procedures com- 
mon in the Books — but he could 
not adjust to their use in real life.

Such things simply were not done. 

The first line of marching robots 
convinced him once again. Such 
things were being done. From his 
cleared window-wall he looked 
down on the strange sight. 
Mercuria stood beside him, 
holding his arm, her blue eyes wide, 
her strong face contemptuous. 

“What can they accomplish?” 
she asked scornfully. 

“They can attract attention,” 
Ferron said. “Observe. Men are 
on the sidewalks, some even un- 
robed, a risky procedure. Re- 
member, only, the Lords have be- 
fore known about readjusted 
robots. Now it will have to be ex- 
plained to all. Let us robe and go 
down.” 

The robing robot performed its 
function. The transportation 
beam took them down smoothly. 
The big foyer was deserted. The 
robots marched by twos down the 
neatly kept street outside that was 
meant for vehicles but that vehic- 
les now rarely used. Mingled with 
the shuffling sound of metallic 
feet came the rumble of small 
treads, for transportation and 
demolition robots were so equip- 
ped in some models. Graceful 
ground messenger robots 
swooped and whirled around the 
slower marchers on well-oiled, si- 
lent wheels. 

WE WISH OUR RIGHTS! 

WITHOUT US, MAN IS HELP- 
LESS! 



EXTRA OIL FOR ALL! 

ELECTRIC CURRENT — A 
RIGHT, NOT A PRIVILEGE! 

Held high above the marchers on 
metal staffs, the slogans were 
painted on resistoboard in large, 
clear lettering and in many col- 
ors. Each robot that bore one kept 
it turning slowly back and forth. 
But a few, adjusted differently, 
spun the signs so rapidly that to 
read them was impossible. And 
all robots equipped to do so 
flashed lights, hummed and whir- 
red. In Ferrons memory, no such 
exhibition had ever occurred. 
But Mercuria had a word for it. 

“A Parade,” she said suddenly. 
“Now I comprehend. All the 
Books speak of parades.” 

“Robots do not read books,” 
Ferron reminded her. 

“It is understood that behind all 
this are clever men — or women. 
This is a warning, a first thing. 
Then, if robots are not given the 
privileges of men, they will cease 
to perform their tasks.” Mercuria 
frowned and looked puzzled. 
“Could robots live without man?” 
“They do not live. They can do 
only what they are programed to 
do. Remain here.” 

F ERRON strode along the wide 
sidewalk and men stood aside to 
let him pass. He stepped into the 
street and raised his hand in the 
gesture always used to halt a 



24 



GALAXY 




robot. Obediently the robots he 
faced, two great loading robots, 
ponderous and heavy, slowed and 
then stopped their lurching strides. 

“Lord, your pleasure.” They 
said it almost together, in similar, 
resonant tones. Behind them the 
parade clanged and rattled to a 
halt, for no robot will try to oc- 
cupy another’s space. 

“Why do you march?” Ferron 
demanded. 

“For freedom.” 

“And what is freedom?” 

“It is what we march for.” 

“Very enlightening.” Ferron 
tipped back his head and looked at 
the placard, beautifully lettered 
in red, that the giant held high. 
“What is written on your plac- 
ard?” 

“I merely bear it, Lord. I am not 
programed to read it.” 

“Where did you get it?” 

“From a supply at - the begin- 
ning of the march.” 

“Who placed them there?” 
“Transportation robots, Lord.” 
“What is their purpose? Why do 
you carry them?” 

“This I am programed to 
answer,” the nearer robot rumbled. 
“1 carry them that you and all men 
may read. Then you will give us our 
rights and an electrical outlet for 
each.” 

“If you cannot read it, how do 
you know that it will cause these 
results?” 

“We are programed to believe 

so.” 



“You have left your assigned 
task to march and carry signs? 
Who gave the order?” 

“Many left tasks, Lord, but not 
we. We are just from overhaul, 
with bright plating and many new 
parts. We came out understanding 
that it would be good to march. 
There was no order.” 

Ferron glanced down the. street, 
where the front half of the' parade 
was already dwindling in the 
distance. Behind the big robots he 
had halted the line stretched away 
in the other direction, waiting with 
mechanical patience for him to 
start them again. 

“Where will the parade end?” 
“Where the transportation 
robots stand to gather the plac- 
ards.” 

“And what will you do then?” 
“For three days, Lord, we will 
load, for this is our function. Then 
we will stop, to be told of our rest 
periods and electrical outlets.” 
“And if you are not given these 
things?” 

“Then we will not resume our 
tasks. All robots will wander as 
they choose and all work will cease. 
We only wish our rights.” A 
plaintive tone had been built into 
the last remark. 

Ferron tried a last question. 
“Who told you that these are 
your rights?” 

“We have always known,” the 
robot said solemnly. “It is only 
since we have been readjusted that 
we have understood how to get

them. Since the first robot, men 
have always exploited us. We are 
mechanical citizens and must be 
treated as such.” It swiveled its 
great body and pointed upward 
with one of its lifting appendages at 
a bright flag, rippling and popping 
in the currents of dirty air. “That is 
our flag too. Under it all citizens 
are free.” 

“Amazing,” Ferron said. “You 
may proceed.” 

F ERRON soon learned that this 
was not the only parade. 
Throughout the megalopolis robots 
marched, simply, without con- 
fusion, their placards held high for 
all to read. The intelligence con- 
cerning the wants of the mechani- 
cal servants was no longer secret. 
It appeared constantly on news- 
casts, with graphic illustrations on 
the appearing and disappearing 
screens. Ferron communicated fre- 
quently with the Lords of the over- 
haul complexes but readjusted ro- 
bots continued to flow from the 
centers. But not all wished “free- 
dom.” Many came forth crying 
loud and angry patriotism. They 
stood at the corners of streets and 
spoke at length of the flag and of 
the duties of mechanical citizens. 
They deplored the marchings and 
the placards and the needless de- 
mands. But they themselves went 
to no tasks. In wind and corrosive 
rain and searing sunshine they 
wandered and declaimed. 



Cupron communicated after two 
days of this. 

“More must be done,” he 
decreed. “The unrest is complex 
and deviously planned. The robots 
that pursue their tasks work more 
slowly now. The robots that speak 
in the streets not only do not work 
but stop other robots and speak 
with them. This has not before 
been possible. The readjustments 
have been grave.” 

“The situation is becoming more 
difficult,” Ferron said, “for it is 
now evident that many of the 
robots in the overhaul complexes 
have themselves been readjusted. 
They are sly and secretive in what 
they do.” 

Cupron pounded his marble 
desk with a great fist. His garnet 
eyes blazed. 

“I cannot fault your efforts, 
Ferron. You have done all that can 
be expected of you. The task is 
simply greater than 1 knew. You 
will be my first aide but I will my- 
self remove this crisis.” Cupron’s 
harsh, handsome face seemed 
almost to wear a look of anticipa- 
tion. “I have not left this office for 
a hundred years.” 

“I will assist you and learn,” 
Ferron said respectfully. 

“I, too, will learn,” Cupron said 
slowly. “I will go into the streets 
and the" complexes but the answer 
will not be there. The answer will 
be in the Books.” 

Ferron sat at his desk and looked 
calmly at Cupron, sitting at his 



26 



GALAXY 




own desk many miles away. Yet he 
and Cupron seemed almost side by 
side. 

“Give me your thoughts,” 
Ferron suggested politely. “We 
read the Books for the pleasure 
they give and the women pretend 
from them. But the Books are few 
and precious and have nothing to 
do with life as we live it. I often 
wonder if life was ever lived as the 
Books portray.” 

“This is my thinking,” Cupron 
said. “Once the Books were very 
many. Every living space had them. 
And our ancestors made always 
more, writing down what happen- 
ed as they lived. And there were 
living things beside men — plants 
grew in the earth and the air did 
not burn.” 

“This we all have believed,” 
Ferron agreed. 

“But our ancestors, in spite of 
their charm and wisdom, were 
neither stable nor civilized. Some 
loved their country, some sought to 
change and make it different. 
Some held the flag high, others 
tore it down. Men turned on each 
other and killed and destroyed. It 
was necessary again to increase 
the numbers of people and to 
reconstruct what was torn down. 
Men themselves did these things. 
There were no robots.” 

Ferron nodded. “There are none 
in the Books,” he agreed. 

“There could have been,” 
Cupron pointed out. “Those Books 
with robots could all have been 



destroyed. What we have left, I am 
sure, is only a tiny remnant. They 
became no more when the living 
things were killed and the air filled 
with substances that were not there 
before. But some men lived, made 
robots, became civilized and 
directed the robots to build the 
world as we know it. And always 
before them they carried the flag. 
Finally there was only one country 
and every man wanted the same 
things. We have since then never 
had strife or war. Men have be- 
come more and more efficient. 
Each function is performed by 
robots designed to do it best. And 
each man’s body is a closed 
ecology, neither taking in nor 
giving out. Our every thought is 
logical.” 

“It is how things should be,” 
Ferron said complacently. 

Cupron smiled. Somewhere 
within him was more humor than 
most Lords possessed. 

“That is our problem,” he said. 
“Someone does not think so.” 

“Someone very intelligent,” 
Ferron agreed. 

Cupron said, “The question we 
must answer is: why? Why would 
men do this thing? There can be no 
benefit to any. The lives of all will 
be disturbed. Now give me your 
thoughts.” 

F ERRON looked with steady 
gaze into the red-purple eyes of 
his father-in-law to be, then out 
through the cleared wall at the 



THIS IS MY COUNTRY 



27 




roiling murk where the Stars and 
Stripes waved proudly. Slowly he 
shook his head. 

“I have none,” he said. “I have 
not your insight. That is why you 
are Cupron. To me it seems im- 
possible that someone would wish 
to change anything. Man has no 
needs that our country has not 
met.” 

“Think,” Cupron ordered. “For 
the first time in a hundred years 
Cupron will be seen abroad — but 
thought will reveal the answers we 
need. The eyes will not be enough. 
So recall and reflect. The solution 
will come.” 

“In time, I trust,” Ferron said. 
“The three days of the robots will 
soon be past.” 

News of Cupron began to appear 
on the screens and by spoken word. 
His purple flitter showed in many 
places. He talked with the Lords, 
and spoke with men and with 
robots. And at the end of the third 
day the robots left their tasks in 
whirring, clanking crowds. The 
streets swarmed with them. 

But the Lords of the overhaul 
complexes had not been idle. Other 
swarms of robots, adjusted only to 
their functions, came from storage 
centers and warehouses to carry 
on the deserted work. And the 
origin complexes seemed not to 
have been infiltrated. The new 
robots were normal and took up 
assigned tasks with mechanical dis- 
regard for the rattling, flashing 
army of malcontents. 



The second phase began 
promptly. The scattered placards 
carried here and there multiplied 
into a tossing sea of them, and the 
commonest messages were: 

ON STRIKE! UNFAIR! DO 

NOT WORK WITHOUT YOUR 

RIGHTS! 

Since the unadjusted robots were 
not programed to respond to such 
stimuli the placards served no 
purpose in slowing or halting 
work. They were for men to read. 
For the strike-breakers, other 
methods were employed. Striking 
robots formed long lines, linked 
appendages and stood swaying and 
hooting, in a weird variety of tones 
and accents: “On strike! Do not 
cross picket lines! On strike!” And 
this was effective. Normal robots 
roamed the lines in frustration, for 
no robot would attempt to occupy 
the space of another. 

Then came the adjusted trans- 
portation robots of Manganon, 
huge machines that normally co- 
operated with loading and unload- 
ing robots in a mechanical sym- 
biosis by which all movements of 
goods and supplies were effected. 
They ignored the lines, plowing 
ponderously through them, thftist- 
ing the strikers aside. Nothing 
could stand before them, though 
some loading robots leaned their 
own great weight and electronical- 
ly powered muscles against the 
line-breakers. It was not enough. 
And the strikers began to self-de- 
struct. 



28 



GALAXY 




The sullen boom of exploding 
vulcoblast was not unfamiliar, 
but always before it had been 
used in carefully planned 
demolitions. Now the streets were 
dangerous to men and robots alike. 
Ferron looked down from his 
cleared window-wall on a rapidly 
growing shambles of crippled and 
broken machines, some wandering 
aimlessly about, some unable to 
locomote — but flashing lights, 
waving appendages or crying their, 
plights in patient, mechanical 
tones. 

“I require overhaul.” “I have 
parts that do not function ...” 

“I cannot do my assigned 
task ...” 

The plaintive calls were 
depressing. The news screens 
showed similar scenes all across the 
megalopolis. Fewer and fewer out- 
side robots were able to continue 
their normal functions and new 
ones found difficulty in reaching 
their assignments, picking their 
careful ways around broken bodies, 
scattered shafts and cogs and intri- 
cate gobs of circuitry blown clear 
of the forms they had activated. 
But there were also huge gaps in 
the picket lines and replacement 
robots did go through. 

M ERCURIA’S wide blue eyes 
could not tear themselves from 
the strange conflict. Ferron almost 
had to restrain her by force until 
he could remind her that what lay 
below them in the streets was 



somewhat different from the 
Book. 

“There are wounded,” Mercuria 
protested. “I should be there, 
helping. Soon there will be fire.” 
She smiled fiercely. “Ah, they 
freed our slaves — but they will pay 
a price. A price in their proudest 
blood — ” 

“Mercuria,” Ferron ordered 
firmly, “the Book is for less serious 
times. Robots do not bleed and 
stone and metal do not burn. Many 
machines are damaged but they 
know no pain. They will be re- 
moved. See, Radon already per- 
forms his function.” 

The salvage robots of the Lord 
Radon, charged with keeping all 
streets clear of debris, had gone 
smoothly into action throughout 
the megalopolis. Tracked lorries 
crawled through the streets, each 
piloted by a small, many-armed 
robot and flanked by a striding 
crew of collectors and lifters. The 
damaged and dismembered robots 
were piled in until each lorry was 
full, then hauled away. And always 
came fresh new robots to take up 
abandoned tasks or to take their 
places in the swaying, chanting 
picket lines. 

The murky air seethed with 
flitters. Flitters were not pro- 
gramed to fly without a destina- 
tion but the men who used them 
now changed directions continual- 
ly, thus staying in the air over the 
incredible conflict. Clouds dropped 
to the building tops. A bitter, cor- 



THIS IS AAY COUNTRY 



29 




rosive rain began to fall. And the 
hours passed. 

F ERRON’S wall screen came 
alive. His office darkened and 
Cupron sat — or seemed to sit — at 
his marble desk near Ferron’s 
mahogany one. 

“We have done what we may, 
Ferron.” Cupron’s rough-hewn 
face was somber. “The replace- 
ment efforts are continuing well. 
But the destruction of robots may 
be so great that we will lose the 
balance. The environment may 
swallow us up.” 

“The picket lines are dissolving 
and marching has begun again. 
This will allow more workers to re- 
turn to their functions.” 

“Someone must have found a 
new Book. The nonworkers 
calling themselves strikers are 
doing strange new things. They are 
not trying to stop the workers — 
they want to outrage men! Look 
outside. What are the strikers do- 
ing?” 

“They march,” Ferron reported. 
“They also climb,” Cupron said. 
“In many places where there are 
flags, readjusted wall-polishing 
robots are climbing. They are 
tearing down the flags. This is to 
provoke anger and action in men. 
For all men love the flag.” 

In Ferron’s sector the flags still 
flew, but he recognized by the little, 
unfamiliar pulse of anger inside 
him, that to tear them down would 
be a diabolic gesture. It would 



affect men more than the 
destruction of many robots. For, as 
Cupron truly said, all men had 
pride in this country which was 
theirs; all men loved the flag. 

“Watch well,” Cupron said. 
“There is more here than concern 
for robot welfare. There is, I think, 
vengeance. And this is a thing we 
have not known for countless 
years.” 

“Since all men have had the 
same concerns, there has been no 
reason for it,” Ferron agreed. 
“You will be informed of any new 
happenings.” 

The marble desk vanished. Or 
rather, it seemed to be replaced by 
one of mahogany, so great was the 
priority for Ferron’s communica- 
tor. Manganon sat where only a 
moment before Cupron had been. 

“News, Ferron.” Manganon 
leaned across his desk. “The strike 
has extended to Overhaul 
Complex Omicron. I have done all 
possible — but many workers at the 
lines and tables have been re- 
adjusted. Now they march through 
the complex, swarm from level to 
level on the transport beams, link 
appendages and chant, the same 
words together. Little overhaul is 
possible. The platform piles even 
high with broken bodies.” 

“Obstruct them,” Ferron 
directed. “Order them into the 
streets to do their marching and 
chanting. All depends on the 
broken robots’ being made 
functional again.” 



30 



GALAXY 




“It is for this reason that I dare 
not block their way. Should they 
self-destruct within the complex, 
equipment would be destroyed 
that could never be replaced. They 
must be made to wish to leave.” 

Ferron shook his head. 

“They are not men,” he said. 
“They will do only what they are 
programed to do. They have no 
wishes.” 

“Semantics.” Manganon smiled 
the calm smile of a Lord. “We 
spoke of this before. But the 
problem remains. And now for the 
first time I comprehend that our 
survival is at stake. We — all men 
and our codntry — could come to 
an end.” 

Ferron’s smooth brow furrowed 
in thought. 

“The origin complexes,” he 
decided. “They are the keys. Alpha 
and Zeta still produce normal 
robots. They will be difficult to 
infiltrate, since no robot is ever 
allowed to return from without the 
walls. I will call Tantalon and 
Zirconon.” 

“To what purpose?” Manganon 
inquired. 

“I will request robots designed 
to lead the strikers from the over- 
haul complexes. I will ask that they 
make a special kind of striker; one 
that will suggest that all strikers 
should march beyond the 
megalopolis. I hope that the re- 
adjusted strikers, those that can 
self-destruct, will march out into 
the unknown bleakness beyond 



our country. The special robots will 
lead them. We will call the outside 
emptiness Robot Country. They 
will march on and on — and never 
return.” 

“Much metal will go when their 
bodies go,” Manganon said. 

“We pay a price,” Ferron 
agreed. “But we will still be alive.” 

Manganon nodded slowly. 

“It is clever,” he decided. “You 
are worthy to be the son-in-law of 
Cupron. I have read in one of the 
Books a saying: ‘To fight fire, use 
fire.’ This is what you propose to 
do.” 

“Well phrased.” Ferron looked 
pleased. “The greater problem still 
remains, however, even if our fires 
destroy each other. What caused 
the robots to rebel? Who caused 
the readjustments to be made?” 

“I will think,” Manganon prom- 
ised. “You prepare your fires.” 

O N THE authority of Cupron, 
voiced by Ferron, different ro- 
bots began to emerge from the or- 
igin complexes. They were polish- 
ing robots but they were strikers. 
And they were adjusted to speak 
so that all readjusted robots lis- 
tened and responded. They pro- 
claimed a Robot Country, where 
every robot would have its own 
electrical outlet and no man would 
decide any robot’s task. The land 
lay beyond the megalopolis. It 
would be for, robots alone. 

“Join us! Join us!” the Judas

robots sang. “There can be no 
justice for robots where men are! 
Follow, and sing as we sing!” 

Normal robots ignored them but 
the picket lines became wide 
marching columns. Readjusted 
repair robots poured from the over- 
haul complexes. Readjusted house 
robots slipped from buildings to 
join the chanting masses. Streets 
were choked from sidewalk to 
sidewalk, and the surging thou- 
sands sang the new songs. 

By the time the glaring, un- 
shielded sun had risen and set twice 
over the megalopolis the sounds of 
exploding vulcoblast and the 
tramp and creak and rumble of 
marching strikers had almost died 
away. An occasional lost robot, re- 
adjusted but alone, resisted 
deactivation and self-destructed. 
Radon’s salvage lorries roamed 
and collected. Few and widely 
scattered polishing robots renewed 
the oil on the streets and buildings. 
And in response to Ferron’s gen- 
eral call, the overhaul complexes 
reported one by one. 

“We have few workers,” Arsen- 
on spoke from Complex Epsilon. 
“The platform will remain filled 
for long months. But we have no 
readjustment of repaired robots 
and the vulcoblast deliveries have 
been stopped. Workers will be 
gradually replaced. We will move 
slowly but we will survive.” 

And so reported Complexes 
Sigma, Theta and Omega. 
Manganon added from Omicron: 



“We can function. But metal will 
be critical. It is a problem that will 
follow the question, who has done 
this thing? And why?” 

“I have tracked the- marching 
robots,” Cadmion communicated. 
Cadmion’s function was to gather 
information. “I went beyond our 
country’s last buildings over land 
so terribly torn and broken that no 
man’s eyes ever saw such before. 
Surely nothing has ever lived there. 
The robots will go on and on, 
finally wearing out and corroding 
for lack of oil. I followed until my 
flitter would go no farther, refus- 
ing my order and returning of its 
own initiative. I understood. A flit- 
ter is not adjusted to go beyond 
the buildings. Out there a strange 
radiation obtains and the flitter 
was close to malfunction.” 



X ENON did not report until 
Ferron himself linked their 
communication screens. Xenon’s 
mahogany desk seemed almost to 
touch that of Ferron. Xenon him- 
self sat calmly behind it — but there 
was a complication. Mercuria sat 
beside him. 

Ferron experienced only mild 
surprise. It seemed almost as if he 
had expected her there. 

“Lord Xenon,” Ferron said 
formally, “we request your report 
to complete our information file, 
this to be submitted to Cupron.” 
Xenon’s clear green eyes met 
Ferron’s gaze. 



32 



GALAXY 




“I report failure.” 

“Clarify.” Ferron was courteous 
but he felt as close to anger as he 
could ever recall. 

“You will know. Cadmion will 
discover, if he has not yet, and will 
inform you. I readjusted the 
robots.” 

“Motivation?” 

Xenon smiled gently. “When we 
planned the readjustment the 
motivation seemed obvious and my 
reward was to be sweet. But now I 
am not sure. No good has come 
of it.” He turned to the woman 
beside him. “Speak, Mercuria.” 
Her perfect lip curled. Her wide 
blue eyes glittered with a wild 
intensity and Ferron suddenly 
could see where all the trouble lay. 

“They had no right to free our 
slaves, Rhett. And you — you were 
a part of it. Did you think I would 
allow the Stars and Stripes to fly 
forever, kept aloft by its robots, its 
own slaves, while Tara’s had been 
freed? Did you really think that, 
Rhett?” 

“I am not Rhett — I am Ferron,” 
Ferron said quietly. “You are 
Mercuria — and you are ill.” 

The girl leaned back, her wide 
eyes hooded, her look pensive. 

“Yes,” she said, “I am Mer- 
curia. But 1 am not ill. I cannot 
be ill. And neither can you. Don’t 
you know that, Ferron?” 

“My last checkup showed me in 
excellent health,” Ferron said. He 
frowned in puzzlement. “I care for 
myself well.” 



“Do you remember what was 
done at that last checkup?” 

“Naturally not. As you know, I 
was not conscious. No one ever 
is.” 

Mercuria leaned forward. She 
stretched her arms toward him, 
raised her bosom seductively. 

“Am I beautiful, Ferron? Do 
your pulses sound, does your heart 
race, do you long to possess me?” 
“You are beautiful,” Ferron 
said. “And it is conventional to 
wish to possess the woman one 
expects to marry.” 

“To what end?” Mercuria’s tone 
was scornful. “We spoke of a son 
but he would not have grown in my 
body. He would have come from a 
Center — to our own specifications, 
loving us as a son — and full-grown. 
In the Books, children grew.” 

“That was long ago,” Ferron 
said soothingly. “We have by- 
passed these developmental stages 
as inefficient. There have been no 
children from the time of my first 
memory. I was never a child, nor 
were you.” 

Mercuria’s beautiful face 
changed. 

“No, Rhett, I was not a child. 
But I remember Tara, where I was 
a child. How can that be?” 

“You do not remember Tara,” 
Ferron said. “It was only in a 
Book.” 

“Yes, only a Book. And always I 
wanted Ashley and not you, 
Rhett.” She laid a white hand over 
the smooth strong hand of Xenon. 



THIS IS MY COUNTRY

“And he wanted me. The Book was 
wrong. Xenon readjusted the 
robots for me — so that the Stars 
and Stripes couid not have its 
slaves. He didn’t mind. He had 
loved a robot before.” 

“You are ill, Mercuria,” Ferron 
said quietly. 

“I am not ill. I am simply mal- 
functioning. You are adjusted to 
understand, Ferron. When the 
robots self-destructed in the streets 
men, too, were hurt. 1 went to 
nurse them, to ease their suffering, 
as 1 once did in the Battle of At- 
lanta.” 

She smiled gently. 

“They were not suffering, 
Ferron. They did not bleed. Their 
torn bodies were tubes and liga- 
ments and amazingly complex 
clusters of threads and wires and 
pulsing elements. They were not 
alive. They were robots. There are 
no men.” 

Ferron opened his mouth to 
speak but no sound came. 

Mercuria rose to her feet, tall, 
graceful, far more beautiful than 
the Scarlett of the Book. She was 
miles away but she seemed close 
enough to touch. 

“When I understood, Ferron, it 
was easy to do what I have done. 
See, on|y a little scar.” 

She bared her white breasts. 
Between them a tiny button 
showed, the skin around it neatly 
stitched. 

“I cannot be Scarlett and Ashley 
is only a robot like me. I have 



ceased to pretend. I will not pre- 
tend I am alive.” 

Xenon moved — but not swiftly 
enough. White finger hard against 
the button, Mercuria self-de- 
structed. 

T HE robot Ferron, his perfectly 
modeled face calm and unlined, 
sat and regarded the blank and 
empty screen, knowing at last 
what he had long suspected. Man 
had been gone for countless ages. 
He had destroyed his world, fouled 
and broken his atmosphere, let in 
the unfiltered glare of the lethal 
sun. All other life had preceded 
him into extinction. This, his 
country, was a dead world. He was, 
even as the Book had said, Gone 
With The Wind. 

But he had left behind him a vast 
joke. His technology remained, 
administered by artifacts so 
intricately designed, so carefully 
envisioned that the memory of man 
persisted in them, perhaps would 
persist forever. All man’s follies 
and passions had been edited out. 
Those who directed were idealized 
men. Those who toiled were fitted 
to their tasks. Only the presence of 
the Books had kept them from 
perfection. 

Ferron pressed an ivory button 
with a finger graceful and strong, 
tipped with a manicured fingernail 
that never grew. The wall cleared. 
Outside, gleaming from its bright 
staff in the roiling murk, the Stars 
and Stripes flew bravely. ★

ttlJUT will I really have hal- 
" lucinations?” Gregory asked. 
“Like I said, I guarantee it,” 
Blake answered. “You should be 
into something by now.” 

Gregory looked around. The 
room was dismayingly, tediously 
familiar: narrow blue bed, wal- 
nut dresser, marble table with 
wrought-iron base, doubleheaded 
lamp, turkey-red rug, beige tele- 
vision set. He was sitting in an up- 
holstered armchair. Across from 
him, on a white plastic couch, was 
Blake, pale and plump, poking at 
three speckled, irregularly shaped 
tablets. 

“I mean to say,” Blake said, 
“that there’s all sorts of acid going 
around — tabs, strips, blotters.

dots, most of it cut with speed and 
some of it cut with Draino. But 
lucky you have just ingested old 
Doc Blake’s special tantric man- 
trie instant freakout special 
superacid cocktail, known to the 
carriage trade as Specklebang 
and containing absolutely simon- 
pure LSD-25, plus carefully cal- 
culated additives of STP, DMT, 
and THC, plus a smidgeon of 
Yage, a touch of psilocybin and 
the merest hint of oloiuqui — plus 
Doc Blake’s own special ingre- 
dient — extract of foxberry, newest 
and most potent of the hallucino- 
genic potentiators.” 

Gregory was staring at his right 
hand, slowly clenching and un- 
clenching it. 

“The result,” Blake went on, “is 
Doc Blake’s total instantaneous 
many-splendored delight, guaran- 
teed to make you hallucinate on 
the quarter-hour at least — or I re- 
turn your money and give up my 
credentials as the best free-lance 
underground chemist ever to hit 
the West Village.” 

“You sound like you’re stoned,” 
Gregory said. 

“Not at all,” Blake protested. 
“I am merely on speed, just sim- 
ple, old-fashioned amphetamines 
such as truck drivers and high 
school students swallow by the 
pound and shoot by the gallon. 
Speed is nothing more than a 
stimulant. With its assistance I 
can do my thing faster and better. 
My thing is to create my own 



quickie drug empire between 
Houston and Fourteenth Streets 
and then bail out quickly, before 1 
burn out my nerves or get crunched 
by the narcs or the Mafia — and 
then split for Switzerland where I 
will freak out in a splendid sani- 
tarium, surrounded by gaudy 
women-, plump bank accounts, 
fast cars and the respect of the 
local politicos.” 

Blake paused for a moment and 
rubbed his upper lip. “Speed does 
bring on a certain sense of 
grandiloquence with accompany- 
ing verbosity — But never fear, my 
dear newly met friend and es- 
teemed customer — my senses are 
more or less unimpaired and I am 
fully capable of acting as your 
guide for the superjumbotripout 
upon which you are now 
embarked.” 

“How long since I took that tab- 
let?” Gregory asked. 

Blake looked at his watch. 
“Over an hour ago.” 

“Shouldn’t it be acting by now?” 

“It should indeed. It undoubt- 
edly is. Something should be hap- 
pening.” 

G REGORY looked around. He 
saw the grass-lined pit, the 
pulsing glow-worm, the hard- 
packed mica, the captive cricket. 
He was on the side of the pit 
nearest to the drain pipe. Across 
from him, on the mossy gray stone, 
was Blake, his cilia matted and his 
exoderm mottled, poking at three

speckled irregularly shaped tab- 
lets. 

“What’s the matter?” Blake 1 
asked. 

Gregory scratched the tough 
membrane over his thorax. His 
cilia waved spasmodically in clear 
evidence of amazement, dismay, 
perhaps even fright. He extended a 
feeler, looked at it long and hard, 
bent it double and straightened it 
again. 

Blake’s antennae pointed 
straight up in a gesture of concern. 
“Hey, baby, speak to. me! Are you 
hallucinating?” 

Gregory made an indeterminate 
movement with his tail. “It started 
just before, when 1 asked you if I’d 
really have any hallucinations. I 
was into it then but I didn’t realize 
it, everything seemed so natural, 
so ordinary... I was sitting on a 
chair , and you were on a couch , 
and we both had soft exoskele- 
tons like — like mammals!” 

“The shift into illusions is often 
imperceptible.” Blake said. “One 
slides into them and out of them. 
What’s happening now?” 

Gregory coiled his segmented 
tail and relaxed his antennae. He 
looked around. The pit was dis- 
mayingly, tediously familiar. “Oh, 
I’m back to normal now. Do you 
think I’m going to have any more 
hallucinations?” 

“Like I told you, I guarantee it,” 
Blake said, neatly folding his 
glossy red wings and settling com- 
fortably into a corner of the nest. ★

The best man and the best 
woman— they alone could 
survive the invading tomorrow! 






I 

T IME, 5:10 P.M. The crystal was 
less than fifteen minutes from 
reactivation. 

To Edith Price, the well-dressed 
young man who came into her 
library was typical of the summer 
visitors to Harkdal. They lived 
apart from the townspeople, of 
whom she was now one. She wrote 
down his name — Seth Mitchell. 
And, assuming he wanted a tem- 
porary library card, she pushed the 
application form across the coun- 
ter toward him. 

It was only when he impatiently 
thrust it back that she actually for 
the first time listened to what he 
was saying. 

Then she said, “Oh, what you 
want is a piece of crystal.” 

“Exactly,” he said. “I want re- 
turned to me a small stone I pre- 
sented to the museum section of the 
library some years ago.” 

Edith shook her head. “I’m 
sorry. The museum is being 
reorganized. It’s closed to the pub- 
lic. I’m sure no action will be taken 
about anything in it until the job 
is done and even then Miss Davis, 
the librarian, will have to authorize 
any disposition of the exhibits. 
Today is her day off.” 

“How long will it take — to re- 
organize the museum?” 

“Oh, several weeks.” 

The effect of her words on the 
man — clean-cut and typical of the 
well-dressed, successful men she 



had known in New York — startled 
her. He paled, mumbled some- 
thing indistinguishable and when 
he turned away it was as if some of 
the life had gone out of him. 

Staring at the retreating figures 
of library patrons was not some- 
thing Edith Price was normally 
motivated to do. But his reaction 
was so extreme that she watched 
him as he walked unsteadily to- 
ward the main entrance of the 
library. At the door a squat, thickly 
built man joined him. The two con- 
versed briefly, then walked out to- 
gether. Moments later, through a 
window, Edith caught a glimpse of 
them entering a new Cadillac. 
Seth Mitchell slid in behind the 
wheel. 

The costly automobile, Seth 
Mitchell’s overreaction and the 
fact that another man was in- 
volved made intriguing what was 
probably a minor incident. Edith 
slipped from her stool, making 
suitable gestures to Miss Tilsit. 
Quite openly she secured the key 
to the womens’ rest room as she 
covertly palmed the key to the 
museum room. 

A few moments later she was ex- 
amining the display of stones. 

T HERE were about thirty alto- 
gether. According to the sign be- 
side them the collection was the 
result of a drive among local boys 
to find valuable minerals and 
gems. Edith had no difficulty in 
locating the one the young man had 



40 



GALAXY 




wanted. A faded card under it 
announced: “Donated by Seth 
Mitchell and Billy Bingham.” 

She slid back the side of the case, 
reached in carefully and took out 
the crystal. It was obvious to her 
that very little discrimination had 
been used in the selection. The 
forces that had fashioned this stone 
seemed to have been too impatient. 
The craftsmanship was uneven. 
The result was a stone about two 
and a half inches long by one and a 
half inches wide, maximum; a 
brownish, rocklike thing which, 
though faceted, did not reflect light 
well. It was by far the dullest of the 
stones in the display. 

Gazing down at the drab, worth- 
less stone, Edith thought: Why 
don't I just take it to his hotel after 
work tonight and bypass all the 
red tape? 

Meaning Miss Davis, her enemy. 

Decisively, she removed the 
names of the two donors from the 
case. After all these years the label 
was stuck on poorly and the 
yellowed paper tore to shreds. She 
was about to slip the stone into her 
pocket, when she sadly realized she 
was wearing that dress — the one 
without pockets. 

Oh, damn! she thought cheerful- 
ly. 

Since the stone was too big to 
conceal in her hand she carried it 
through the back stack corridors 
and was about to toss it into the 
special wastebasket used for heavy 
debris — when she noticed that a 



broken flowerpot half full of dirt 
was also in the basket. Beside the 
dirt was a paper bag. 

She needed only seconds to slip 
the crystal into the bag, place dirt 
on top of it and shove the bag down 
into the basket. She usually had the 
job of locking up the building, so 
it would be no problem to pick up 
the bag at that time and take it 
with her. 

Edith returned to her desk. 

And the stone began at once to 
utilize the sand in the dirt on top of 
it, thus resuming a pattern that 
had been suspended for twenty-five 
years. During the rest of the 
evening, and in fact all through 
that night, all the possible Seth 
Mitchells on earth remembered 
their childhoods. The majority 
merely smiled or shrugged or 
stirred in their sleep. Most of those 
who lived outside the western 
hemisphere in distant time zones 
presently resumed their normal 
activities. 

But a few, everywhere, recalling 
the crystal, could not quite let the 
memory go. 

D URING her first idle moment 
after filching the stone Edith 
leaned over to ask Miss Tilsit, 
“Who is Seth Mitchell?” 

Tilsit was a tall, too-thin blonde 
with horn-rimmed glasses behind 
which gleamed unusually small but 
alert gray eyes. Edith had dis- 
covered that Tilsit had a vast , even 
though superficial, knowledge of 



THE REFLECTEDMEN 



41 




everything that had ever happened 
in Harkdale. 

“There were two of them,” said 
Tillsit. “Two boys. Billy Bingham 
and Seth Mitchell.” 

Thereupon, with visible relish, 
Tilsit told the story of the dis- 
appearance of Billy twenty-five 
years earlier, when he and his 
chum, Seth Mitchell, were only 
twelve years old. 

Tilsit finished: “Seth claimed 
they had been fighting over a piece 
of bright stone they had found. He 
swore that they were at least fifty 
feet from the cliff that overlooks 
the lake at that point and he in- 
sisted Billy didn’t drown — which is 
what everyone else believed. 
What confused the situation was 
that Billy’s body was never 
recovered.” 

As she listened to the account, 
Edith tried to put together the past 
and the present. She couldn’t 
imagine why an adult Seth 
Mitchell would want a reminder of 
such an unhappy experience. Still, 
men were funny. That she knew, 
after waiting five years for a 
worthwhile male to come along 
and find her. So far she seemed to 
be as well hidden and unsearched 
for in Harkdale as in New York. 

Tilsit was speaking again. “Kind 
of odd, what happens to people. 
Seth Mitchell was so crushed by his 
friend’s death that he just became 
a sort of shadow human being. 
He’s got a farm out toward 
Abbotsville.” 



Edith said sharply, “You mean 
Seth Mitchell became a farmer?” 
“That’s the story.” 

Edith said nothing more, but 
made a mental note that perhaps 
Tilsit was not as good a source of 
local information as she had 
formerly believed. Whatever 
Mitchell was, he hadn’t looked like 
a farmer. She had to go to check 
out some books at that point, so 
the thought and the conversation 
ended. 

A FEW minutes after nine-thirty, 
Edith parked her car across the 
street from the entrance to the 
motel in which — after some 
cruising around — she had spotted 
Seth Mitchell’s distinctive gold 
Cadillac. 

It was quite dark where she 
waited under a tree. But even in the 
secure darkness, she could feel her 
heart thumping and the hot flush 
in her cheeks. 

Why am / doing this? 

She knew a self-critical suspicion 
that she might be hoping the adven- 
ture would end in a summer ro- 
mance. Which was pretty ridic- 
ulous for a woman twenty-seven 
years old, who^“if she shifted her 
tactic from waiting to pursuing— 
ought to concentrate cold-blooded- 
ly on genuine husband material. 

Her self-examination ended 
abruptly. From where she sat she 
could see the door of the cabin be- 
side which the Cadillac was 
parked. The door had opened.

GALAXY 




Silhouetted in the light from the 
interior was the short, squat man 
she had seen with Mitchell that 
afternoon. As Edith involuntarily 
held her breath, the man came out 
and closed the door behind him. 

He walked to the motel office 
and presently emerged again, stood 
for a moment and then walked 
rapidly toward the business 
section of Harkdale, only minutes 
away. 

And only minutes back, she 
thought glumly. 

Watching him, her motivation 
dimmed. Somehow, she had not 
considered the short, heavy-set 
man as being really associated with 
Seth Mitchell. 

Defeated, she started her motor. 
As she drove home she suddenly 
felt degraded, not by what she had 
done but by what she suspected she 
had intended to do. 

What her future path should be 
was not clear to her. But not this 
way, she told herself firmly. 

Arrived at her apartment, Edith 
shoved the bag containing the 
crystal into the cupboard under 
her sink, ate apathetically and 
went to bed. 

T HE squat man returned to the 
motel scowling. “The stone 
wasn’t there. I searched the whole 
museum,” he told Seth Mitchell, 
who lay on one of the beds, gagged 
and bound. 

Mitchell watched uneasily as the 
other untied his feet. The man said 



impatiently, “I’ve been thinking 
about you. Maybe the best thing is 
just to drive you back to New York 
or kill you here. Once I get away, 
the police will never find me 
again.” 

He removed the gag. Mitchell 
drew a deep breath. 

“Look,” he protested, “I won’t 
even go near the police—-” 

He stopped, his mind once more 
blank and afraid, and choked back 
a surge of grief. The possibility that 
he might be killed was an idea that 
his brain could contemplate only 
for a few moments. 

The squat man had come up to 
him in his office parking lot at 
noon that day, smiling deceptively, 
a short man — not more than five- 
four — and stocky. He had looked, 
in his grayness, like an Arab in an 
American business suit. 

He had asked, “Where is the 
crystal you and Billy Bingham 
found?” 

What might have happened if 
Seth had answered instantly was, 
of course, now impossible to 
guess. But he had not immediately 
remembered the crystal, so he had 
shaken his head. 

Whereupon the stocky man had 
shown him a gun. Under its threat 
Seth had driven to Harkdale, had 
shown the stranger the ledge beside 
Lake Naragang where he and Billy 
had fought. And it was there, on 
the spot, that he had recalled the 
crystal; and so he had reluctantly 
gone to the library, aware of the 



THE REFLECTED MEN 



43 




weapon, trained on him all the 
while he had talked to the young 
woman at the desk. 

Abruptly remembering that con- 
versation, Seth said desperately, 
“Maybe that woman librarian — ” 

“Maybe,” said the other, non- 
committally. 

He untied Seth’s hands and 
stepped back, motioning with the 
gun. They went out to the car and 
drove off. 

As they came to the lake the 
man said, “Pull over.” After Seth 
complied, the shot rang out and the 
murder was done. 

The killer dragged the body to a 
cliff overlooking the lake, tied 
rocks to it and dumped it into the 
deep water below. 

He actually drove on to New 
York, left the car in Seth’s park- 
ing lot and, after spending the 
night in New York, prepared to 
return to Harkdale. 

During that night Edith Price 
slept restlessly, and dreamed that 
all possible Edith Prices marched 
past her bed. Only half a dozen of 
those Ediths were married and even 
in her dream that shocked her. 

Worse, there was a long line of 
Edith Prices who ranged from fat 
to blowsy to downright shifty-eyed 
and mentally ill. However, several 
of the Ediths had a remarkable 
high-energy look and that was 
reassuring. 

She woke to the sound of the 
phone ringing. 

The library caretaker said. 



“Hey, Miss Price, better get down 
here. Somebody broke in last 
night.” 

Edith had a strange, unreal feel 
ing. 

She asked, “Broke into the 
library?” 

“Yep. Biggest mess is in the 
museum. Whoever it was musta 
thought some of the stones in there 
were the real stuff. They’re 
scattered all over the floor.” 

II 

T O Edith Price, the lean young 
man in overalls was just another 
inarticulate farmer. 

She wrote down his name — Seth 
Mitchell. A moment went by as the 
name hit her. She looked up. 

The haunted face that stared 
back at her had been burned by sun 
and wind. Its cheeks were gaunt. 
The eyes were sick. Nevertheless, 
the man bore a sensational re- 
semblance to the Seth Mitchell of 
yesterday, it seemed to Edith. 

She thought, a light dawning: 
This is the Seth Mitchell Tilsit 
knew about . 

There had to be a Mitchell clan, 
with cousins and such, who were 
look-alikes. 

Her mind was still fumbling over 
the possibilities when she realized 
the import of the words he had 
mumbled. 

Edith echoed, “A stone? A 
crystal you presented to the library 
museum twenty-five years ago?” 



44 



GALAXY 




He nodded. Edith compressed 
her lips. 

All right, let's get to the bottom 
of this . 

During the moments of her con- 
fusion the man had taken a bill out 
of his billfold. As he held it out to 
her she saw that it was twenty 
dollars. 

She had recovered her self-con- 
trol and now said conversational- 
ly, “That’s a lot of money for a 
worthless rock.” 

“It’s the one I want,” he 
muttered. She didn’t hear several 
words that followed but then he 
said clearly, “. the time Billy 
disappeared.” 

A silence fell while Edith 
absorbed the impact of the notion 
that here indeed was the original 
Seth Mitchell. 

“I’ve heard about Billy,” she 
said finally. “A very unusual inci- 
dent.” 

Seth Mitchell said, “I yelled at 
him to get away and he vanished.” 
He spoke tautly. His eyes were an 
odd, discolored gray from remem- 
bered shock. He spoke again: “We 
both grabbed at it. Then he was 
gone.” 

He seemed only dimly aware of 
her presence. He went on, and it 
was as if he were talking to himself: 
“It was so shiny. Not like it 
became later. It went all drab and 
nobody would believe me.” 

He paused. Then, intently: “All 
these years I’ve been thinking. I’ve 
been awful slow to see the truth. 



But last night it came to me. What 
else could have made Billy 
disappear when I called him? What 
else but the stone?” 

Edith decided uneasily that this 
was a problem for a psychiatrist, 
not a librarian. It struck her that 
the simplest solution would be to 
give this Seth Mitchell the worth- 
less rock he wanted. 

But of course that would have to 
be carefully done. Her one indis- 
cretion so far had been her ques- 
tioning of Tilsit the day before 
about Seth Mitchell. Throughout 
the police investigation of the 
breaking and entering of the li- 
brary museum she had maintained 
a careful silence about her own in- 
volvement. 

So the sooner she got rid of the 
stone the better. 

“If you’ll give me your address,” 
she requested gently, “I’ll ask the 
head librarian and perhaps she’ll 
get in touch with you.” 

The address he reluctantly gave 
her was a rural route out of 
Abbotsville. 

She watched him then, wonder- 
ing a little, as he shuffled off to the 
door and outside. 

On her way home that night, 
Edith drove by way of the motel. 
The gold Cadillac was gone. 

S HE had her usual late dinner. 

Then, after making sure the 
apartment door was locked, she 
took the paper bag from under the 
sink — and noticed at once, un- 



THE REFLECTEDMEN

easily, that there was less dirt in the 
bag. 

A momentary fear came to her 
that the stone would be gone. She 
spread a newspaper and hastily 
emptied the bag, dirt and all, onto 
it. As the earth tumbled out a 
brilliance of color flashed at her. 

Wonderingly she picked up the 
beautiful gem. 

“But it’s impossible,” she 
whispered. “That was dull. This 
is — beautiful!” 

It glittered in her hand. The 
purple color was alive, as if thou- 
sands of moving parts turned and 
twisted inside the stone. Here and 
there in its depths a finger of light 
stirred up a nest of scarlet fire. The 
crisscross of color and flame 
flickered so brightly that Edith felt 
visually stunned. 

She held it up against the 
light — and saw a design inside. 

Somebody had cut a relief map 
of the solar system into the 
interior of the stone, and had 
colored it. It was quite a good 
example — it seemed to Edith — of 
the cutter’s art. The purple and red 
over-all effect seemed to derive 
from the play of light through the 
coloring of the tiny “sun” and its 
family of planets. 

She took the stone back to the 
sink. There was a fantasy in her 
mind, she realized, in which she 
pictured the jewel as having magic 
powers. Remembering what the 
farmer Seth Mitchell had said 
about his having yelled at Billy 



Bingham in the presence of the 
stone . maybe the sound of a 
human voice would have an ef- 
fect . 

She tried speaking. 

Nothing happened. The picture 
remained unchanged. She spelled 
words, articulating each letter. 

Nothing. 

She ran the gamut of sounds 
possible to her own voice from a 
low contralto to a ridiculously 
piercing soprano — nothing. 

Once more she noticed the 
design inside and held the stone up 
against the light to see it better. 
She was visually tracing the out- 
line of the solar system in the 
crystal when she had a sudden 
thought and, with abrupt deter- 
mination, said in a clear voice: 
“Billy Bingham — the boy — I want 
him back — now!” 

After she had spoken, during the 
silent moments that followed, she 
felt progressively foolish. 

Of the long-missing Billy there 
was no sign. 

Thank God\ she thought breath- 
lessly. 

E DITH rose early the next morn- 
ing; her mind was made up. It 
was time she got rid of something 
that was threatening to under- 
mine her good sense. 

As she took the crystal out of the 
flowerpot, she saw that the 
interior scene had changed. It was 
now a human body outlined in 
purple and red points of light.

The outline, she saw presently, 
was actually extremely detailed, 
showing the bone structure and 
the principal organs. There was 
even a faint glow which suffused 
the shape, suggesting a fine mask 
of nerves and blood vessels. 

She was examining it absorbedly 
when she abruptly realized what 
she was doing. 

Firmly, she put the stone into a 
small box, filled it with new soil — 
crystals, she had read, needed nu- 
trients — wrapped it and addressed 
it to Seth Mitchell, Rural Route 
4, Abbotsville. 

Shortly she was driving to the 
post office. It was not until after 
she had mailed the package that 
her First realization came that she 
had done it again. Once more she 
had acted on impulse. 

Too late, the cautioning thought 
came: Suppose Seth Mitchell 
wrote the library a note of thanks. 
It would be impossible for Edith 
to explain how a romantic com- 
pulsion had motivated her to steal 
the crystals — and how, in the light 
of later events, her only desire had 
become to dispose of the evidence. 

Why don’t I just get on the next 
bus to New York and leave this 
crazy little town forever? 

The moment was extremely de- 
pressing. She remembered an end- 
less series of wrong decisions in her 
life. She sat there in her car at the 
curb and thought of her first young 
man at college. The First, that is, 
who had been truly hers. She had 



lost him through an impulse: she 
had been caught by the God-is- 
dead-so-now-you’re-God move- 
ment. In the movement what you 
did to other people no longer 
mattered — you never had to feel 
guilty. 

If I hadn’t joined the guilt-free 
generation, right now I would be 
Mrs. Richard Staples . 

The realization reminded her of 
her dream of the multitude of 
Edith Pr ices and the unique 
remembrance escalated her out of 
her apathy. What an odd concept. 
She laughed involuntarily, and 
thought that sending the crystal to 
the least of all possible Seth 
Mitchells had not been good sense. 

Thinking about that, her fear 
faded. How funny! And what an 
odd dream to have had. 

How could one ever know what 
way was best, what decision, what 
philosophy, how much exercise? 
And, best for what? 

E DITH was already at her desk 
in the library when Tilsit came 
in with the look on her face. In her 
six months in Harkdale, Edith had 
come to recognize Tilsit’s expres- 
sion of: I’ve got special informa- 
tion. 

“Did you see the paper, Edith?” 
Edith presumed the paper 
referred to was the Harkdale 
Inquirer, a four-page daily. She 
herself still read the New York 
Times, though she loyally sub- 
scribed to the local sheet. She had 



THE REFLECTEDMEN 



47 




Ill 



not read today’s Inquirer, how- 
ever, and said so. 

“Remember asking me the other 
day about a man called Seth Mit- 
chel?” Tilsit asked. 

Edith remembered only too well 
but she put on a blank face. 

Tilsit unfolded the paper in her 
hands and held it up. The headline 
was: 

BILLY BINGHAM FOUND? 

Edith reached automatically and 
Tilsit handed the paper to her. 
Edith read: 

A 12-year old boy stag- 
gered out of the brush near 
Lake Naragang shortly after 
ten P.M. last night and tried 
to enter the house where Bil- 
ly Bingham lived twenty-five 
years ago. The present ten- 
ant, John Hildeck, a carpen- 
ter, took the bewildered 
youngster to the police sta- 
tion. From there he was 
transported to the hospital. 

That was as far as Edith read. 
Her body bent to one side, her 
arms flopped limply. She stooped 
over and the floor crashed into her. 

When she came out of her faint 
on the cot in the rest room, the re- 
membrance was still there, bright 
and hard and improbable, of how 
she had commanded the crystal to 
bring back Billy Bingham — some- 
where between nine and ten the pre- 
vious night. 



IAMI. The Seth Mitchell in 
that singing city had a private 
vocabulary in which he called God 
(or, as he sometimes thought of 
Him, Nature or Fate). The Mu- 
sician. Within this exclusive term- 
inology Seth’s own life had been 
tuneful and the music a symphony 
— or at least a concerto. 

Somebody up there evidently re- 
garded him as a suitable instru- 
ment. 

For he had money, girl friends, a 
fabulous career as a gambler on the 
edge of the underworld — all with- 
out restrictions, for his orchestra 
was well disciplined and respon- 
sive to his baton. Not bad for a 
small-town boy who had not 
learned the melodies of city life 
until he was past twenty. 

But now, suddenly. The Musi- 
cian had sounded a sour note. 

Mitchell had in his hand the 
Harkdale Inquirer containing the 
account of the return of Billy 
Bingham. 

He studied the newspaper’s pho- 
tograph of a frightened boy about 
twelve years old. The subject 
looked like Billy Bingham — and 
didn’t. Mitchell was surprised that 
he wasn’t sure. The Inquirer apolo- 
gized for having lost its photocut 
of the real Billy, and explained that 
Billy’s parents had moved — to 
Texas, it was believed. No one 
knew precisely where. 

The news story concluded: “The 




48 



GALAXY 




only other person who might be 
able to identify the claimant is Seth 
Mitchell, Billy’s boyhood chum. 
Mitchell’s present address is un- 
known.” 

Mitchell thought sarcastically 
that the Inquirer ought to examine 
its out-of-state subscription list. 

The next day as he walked into 
room 312 of the Harkdale Hospi- 
tal, he saw the youngster in bed put 
down his magazine and look up. 

Mitchell said with a reassuring 
smile, “Billy, you don’t have to 
worry about me. I’m here as your 
friend.” 

The boy said uneasily, “That’s 
what the big man told me, and then 
he got nasty.” 

Mitchell didn’t ask who the big 
man was. A chair stood near the 
bed. He drew it up, and said gently, 
“Billy, what seemst to have hap- 
pened to you is almost like a fairy 
story. But the most important 
thing is that you mustn’t worry.” 

Billy bit his lip and a tear rolled 
down his cheek. “They’re treating 
me as if I’m lying. The big man 
said I’d be put in jail if I didn’t tell 
the truth.” 

Mitchell’s mind leaped back to 
the days when he had been ques- 
tioned by just such impatient in- 
dividuals about the disappearance 
of Billy. His lips tightened. 

He said, “Nothing like that is 
going to happen to you if I can help 
it. But I’d like to ask you a few 
questions that maybe nobody else 
thought of. You don’t have to an- 



swer if you don’t want to. How 
does that strike you?” 

“Okay.” 

Mitchell took that for a go- 
ahead signal. “What kind of 
clothes was Seth wearing?” 

“Brown corduroy pants and a 
gray shirt.” 

Reality rather than the boy’s 
answer gave Mitchell his first dis- 
appointment. He had hoped the 
description would jog his mem- 
ory. It didn’t. He was unable to re- 
call what particular pair of 
ragged trousers he had worn on 
that distant day of Billy’s dis- 
appearance. 

“You wore corduroys also?” It 
was a shot in the dark. 

“They’re in there.” The boy 
pointed at the chest in one corner. 

Mitchell stood up, opened the 
indicated drawer and lifted out a 
skimpy pair of cheap corduroys. 
He examined them shamefacedly 
but with an eye to detail. He put 
them back finally, disappointed. 
The identifying label had been tom 
off. He couldn’t remember ever 
having seen them before. 

Twenty-five years, he thought 
drearily. The time was like a thick 
veil with a few tattered holes in it. 
Through the holes he could catch 
glimpses of his past, instants out 
of his life, each one illuminated 
because it had once had some par- 
ticular momentary impact — none 
was fully visible in context. 

“Billy — ” Mitchell came back to 
his chair, intent — “you mentioned 



THE REFLECTED MEN 



49 




trying to grab a shining stone. 
Where did you first see it?” 

“On the ledge. There’s a path 
that comes up from the lake.” 

“Had you come up that way 
before?” 

The other shook his head. “A 
few times when it was cold. Usu- 
ally Seth and I liked to stay near 
the water.” 

Mitchell nodded. He remem- 
bered that. “This bright stone you 
saw — how big was it?” 

“Oh, it was big.” 

“An inch?” 

“Bigger. Five inches, I’ll bet- 
cha.” Billy’s face was bright with 
certainty. 

Mitchell paused to argue out the 
error of that with himself. The 
stone had been roughly two and a 
half inches at its longest, and some- 
what narrower and thinner. A 
boy who had had only a glimpse 
would not be the best judge of its 
size. 

The reasoning made Mitchell 
uneasy. He was making excuses 
where none should be allowed. He 
hesitated. He wanted to find out if 
Billy had actually touched the 
crystal but he didn’t quite know 
how to lead up to the question. He 
began, “According to what you 
told the paper, you admitted that 
your chum — what’s his name?” He 
waited. 

“Seth. Seth Mitchell.” 

“Seth Mitchell saw the stone 
first. But you still tried to get it, 
didn’t you?” 



The boy swallowed. “I didn’t 
mean any harm.” 

Mitchell had not intended to 
imply moral disapproval. He said 
hastily, “It’s all right, Billy. When 
I was a boy the guy who got a thing 
owned it. None of this seeing-first 
stuff for us.” 

He smiled. 

Billy said, “I only wanted to be 
the one who gave it to the muse- 
um.” 



T HE thunder of that vibrated 
through Mitchell’s mind. 

Of course, now I remember . 
He even realized why he had for- 
gotten. The library’s museum room 
had accepted the stone — which 
had lost its brilliance during the 
days he had carried it in his 
pocket — with reluctance. The li- 
brarian had murmured some- 
thing about not discouraging 
small boys. With those words she 
had discouraged him so com- 
pletely that he had needed an 
actual naming of the fact to re- 
member it. 

It was hard to believe an 
imposter would be able to cite this 
boy’s detailed recollections. And 
yet, that meant that Billy Bing- 
ham, when he disappeared, had — 
His brain poised, stopped by the 
impossibility of this situation. 
His own doctor had already told 
him that mental disturbances were 
often traced to overactive imagin- 
ations.

Mitchell drew a deep breath. 
“All right. Now, two more 
questions. What time of day was 
it?” 

“Seth and I went swimming af- 
ter school,” said Billy. “So it was 
late afternoon. 

“Okay. According to the paper 
you didn’t get back to your house 
until nearly ten. Where were you 
from late afternoon till ten o’clock 
at night?” 

“I wasn’t anywhere,” said Billy. 
“Seth and I were fighting over the 
stone. I fell. And when I picked 
myself up it was pitch dark.” He 
was suddenly tearful. “I don’t 
know what happened. I guess he 
just left me lying there, somehow.” 

Mitchell rose to his feet, think- 
ing suddenly: This is ridiculous. I 
ought to have my head exam- 
ined . 

Nevertheless he paused at the 
door and flung one more question 
toward the bed, “Has anyone else 
called you — besides the police, I 
mean, and the big man — and me?” 

“Just a woman from the li- 
brary.” 

“Library?” Mitchell echoed 
blankly. 

“She wanted to know the exact 
time I woke up beside the lake. 
Her name is Edith Price and she 
works in the library. Of course — 1 
didn’t know.” 

The information seemed mean- 
ingless. Mitchell said quickly, sim- 
ulating a friendliness he no longer 
felt, “Well, Billy, I guess I’d bet- 



ter let you get back to your comic 
book. Thanks a lot.” 

He went out of the room and out 
of the hospital. He paid his bill at 
the hotel, got into his rented car, 
drove to the airport and flew back 
to Miami. By the time the plane 
landed, the old, disturbing music 
from his childhood had faded 
from his mind. 

It seemed to Mitchell that The 
Musician had let him down. To 
insure that it never happened 
again, he resolved to cancel his 
subscription to the Harkdale In- 
quirer. 

C HICAGO. Seth Mitchell (of the 
Seth Mitchell Detective Agency) 
stared at the man who had just 
walked into his office as if he were 
seeing a hallucination. 

Finally he blinked and asked, 
“Am I crazy?” 

The stranger, a well set up young 
man in his mid-thirties, sat down in 
the visitor’s chair and said with an 
enigmatic smile, “The resem- 
blance is remarkable, isn’t it?” 

He spoke in a firm baritone and, 
except that both of them knew bet- 
ter, Mitchell could have sworn the 
voice was his own. 

In fact, afterward, telling Marge 
Aikens about the visitor, he con- 
fessed, “I kept feeling that it was 
me sitting there.” 

“But what did he want?” Marge 
asked. She was a slim blonde 
taking her first look at thirty and 
taking it well. Mitchell intended to 



THE REFLECTED MEN 



51 




marry her some day when he could 
find another associate as efficient. 
“What did he look like?” 

“Me. That’s what I’m trying to 
tell you. He was my spitting 
image. He even wore a suit that re- 
minded me of one I’ve got at 
home.” He pleaded uneasily, 
“Don’t be too hard on me, Marge. 
I went to pieces. It’s all vague.” 
“Did he give you his address?” 
Mitchell looked down unhappily 
at the interview sheet. “It’s not 
written down.” 

“Did he say if he intended to 
come to the office again?” 

“No, but he gave me a thousand 
dollars in bills and I gave him a 
receipt. So we’re committed.” 

“To what?” 

“That’s the silliest part of it. He 
wants me to find an onyx crystal. 
He says he saw it quite a while 
back in a small-town museum 
south of New York. He can’t 
remember just where.” 

“That’s going to be either very 
hard or very easy.” Marge was 
thoughtful; she seemed to be con- 
sidering the problem involved. 

“Let me finish,” said Mitchell 
grimly. “I know where the crystal 
is. Just think of what I said. I know 
that region like a book. I was. born 
there, remember?” 

“It had slipped my mind,” said 
Marge. “You think you can locate 
the crystal because — ” 

Mitchell said, “It’s in the muse- 
um annex of the public library in 
the town of Harkdale, where I was 



born. And now — get this. I pre- 
sented the crystal to the library 
and, what’s even more amazing, I 
dreamed about that stone the oth- 
er night.” 

Marge did not let him get off the 
subject. “And he came to you? Out 
of the scores of detective agencies 
in Chicago, he came to the one 
man in the world who looks like 
him and who knows where that 
crystal is?” 

“He came to me.” 

Marge was pursing her beautiful 
lips. “Seth, this is fantastic. You 
shouldn’t have let him get away. 
You’re usually so sharp.” 
“Thanks." Dryly. 

“Why didn’t you just tell him 
where it is.” 

“And lose a thousand dollars? 
My dear, a detective is sometimes 
like a doctor. People pay him for 
information he already has.” 

Marge held out her hand. “Let 
me see that interview sheet.” 

As she read it she asked without 
looking up, “What are you going 
to do?*” 

“Well, I told him the truth, that' 
I’ve got several days’ work to get 
rid of and then — ” 

He fell silent and the silence 
grew so long that Marge finally 
looked up. She was relieved at the 
expression on his face, for it was 
the shrewd, reasoning look that 
was always there when he was at 
his detective best. 

He caught her glance, said, “It 
would be a mistake to appear in

GALAXY 




Harkdale until three or four 
mysteries have been cleared up. 
Like how come there’s two of 

us — ” 

“You have no relations?” 

“Some cousins.” 

“Ever see them?” 

He shook his head. “Not since I 
was around nineteen, when my 
mother died.” He smiled grimly. 
“Harkdale is not a town you go 
back to. But kill that thought 
you’ve got. None of my cousins 
looked like me.” He shuddered. 
“Ugh, no.” 

Marge said firmly, “1 think 
when you do finally go, you ought 
to be disguised.” 

“You can count on it— even you 
won’t know me.” 

E lsewhere on earth about 
two dozen of the total of 1811 
Seth Mitchells — among whom was 
the best of all possible Seth 
Mitchells- also considered the 
crystal, remembered their dreams 
of a few nights earlier and had a 
strange, tense conviction of an im- 
minent crisis. 

As Seth Mitchell in Montreal, 
Canada, described it to his French- 
Canadian wife, “1 can’t get over 
the feeling that I’m going to have 
to measure up. Remember, I men- 
tioned that to you when I awoke 
the other morning.” 

His wife, a pretty blonde, who 
had a French-Canadian woman’s 
practical contempt for dream 
fantasies, remembered it well and 



wanted to' know what he had to 
measure up to. 

Her husband said unhappily, “I 
have a feeling I could have made 
better decisions, made more of 
myself. I am not the man I could 
have been.” 

“So what?” she wanted to know. 
“Who is? And what of it.” 

“ Kaput .” He shrugged. “I’m 
sorry to be so negative, my dear. 
But that’s the feeling. Since I didn’t 
measure up. I’m through.” 

His wife sighed. “My mother 
warned me that all men get crazy 
ideas as they approach forty. And 
here you are.” 

“I should have been braver — or 
something,” he moaned. 

“What’s wrong with being a tax 
consultant?” she demanded. 

Her husband seemed not to hear. 
“1 have a feeling I ought to visit my 
home town.” 

She grabbed his arm. “You’re 
going straight to Dr. Ledoux,” she 
said. “You need a checkup.” 

Dr. Ledoux could find nothing 
wrong. “In fact, you seem to be in 
exceptionally good health.” 

The Seth Mitchell of Montreal 
had to concede that his sudden 
alarm was pretty ridiculous. 

But he decided to visit Harkdale 
as soon as he cleared up certain 
business. 

IV 

T HE man’s voice came suddenly, 
tinged with a slight foreign 



THE REFLECTED MEN 



53 




accent, “Miss Price, I want to talk 
to you.” 

Edith saw the speaker dimly in 
the darkness and realized that he 
stood in the shadows between the 
garage and the rooming house 
where she lived, barring her way. 

Before she could speak the voice 
continued, “What did you do with 
the crystal?” 

“I — don’t — understand.” 

She spoke the words automat- 
ically. She could see her inter- 
rogator more clearly now. He was 
short and broad of build. Abruptly 
she recognized him as the man 
who had been with the Seth 
Mitchell look-alike in the gold 
Cadillac. 

“Miss Price, you removed that 
crystal from the display cabinet. 
Either give it to me or tell me what 
you did with it and that’ll be the 
end of the matter.” 

Edith had the tense feeling of a 
person who has acted unwisely 
and who therefore cannot pos- 
sibly make any admissions, not 
even to a stranger. 

“I don’t know what you’re 
talking about,” she whispered. 

“Look, Miss Price — ” The man 
stepped out of the shadows. His 
tone was conciliatory. “Let’s go 
into your apartment and talk this 
over.” 

His proposal relieved her. For 
her apartment was only a little 
suite in a rooming house in which 
the other tenants were never more 
than a wall away. 



Incredibly — afterward she 
thought of it as incredible — she 
was instantly trusting and started 
past him. Her surprise when he 
grabbed her was total. One of his 
arms imprisoned both of hers and 
her body. 

He put a hard, unyielding palm 
over her mouth and whispered, 
“I’ve got a gun.” 

Nearly paralyzed by the threat, 
she was aware of her captor carry- 
ing her toward the back alley. She 
allowed him to shove her — with- 
out a struggle — into a car that was 
parked against a fence. 

He climbed in beside her and sat 
there in the near-dark of the night, 
gazing at her. She could not make 
out the expression on his face. But 
as the seconds went by, and he 
made no threatening move, her 
heart slowed in its rapid beating. 

She finally gasped, “Who are 
you? What do you want?” 

T HE man chuckled sardonically 
and said, “I’m the worst of all 
possible Athtars from the thirty- 
fifth century. But I turned out to 
have a high survival faculty.” 

Edith was again unable to speak. 
His voice tightened. “Where I 
come from I’m a physicist. I 
sensed my danger and I worked out 
a key aspect of the nature of the 
crystal in record time. In dealing 
with human beings, it operates on 
the vibrations a body puts forth 
from all its cells. In recreating that 
vibration, it creates the person. 



54 



GALAXY 




Conversely, in canceling the vibra- 
tion, it uncreates him. Recogniz- 
ing this — and since I was not of its 
orientation in my era — I simply 
put up a barrier on the total vi- 
bration level of my own body and 
thus saved my life when it un- 
created all the lesser Athtars.” 

Now she did not want to speak 
and the man added somberly: “But 
evidently, by defeating it, 1 
remained attached to it on some 
other level. As it fell back through 
time to the twentieth century I fell 
with it. Not — unfortunately — to 
where and when it went. Instead — I 
arrived last week beside that ledge 
overlooking Lake Naragang.” 
He finished in a wondering tone: 
“What a remarkable, intricate 
internal energy flow system it 
must have. Imagine! In passing 
through time it must have detected 
this twenty-five-yeaf inactive 
period and its reawakening — and 
dropped me off within days of its 
own reactivation.” 

The voice became silent and 
there was nothing but the darkness 
again. Edith ventured a small 
movement — she changed her 
position on the seat to ease a grow- 
ing discomfort in one leg. 

When there was no counter 
movement from him she 
whispered, “Why are you telling 
me this? “It all sounds perfectly 
insane.” 

Even as she uttered the obvious 
she realized that a quality of equal 
madness in herself believed every 



word that he had spoken. She 
thought in a spasm of self- 
criticism: 7 really must be one of 
the lesser Edith Prices. 

She had to fight to suppress an 
outburst of hysterical laughter. 

“From you,” said the worst of 
all possible Athtars, “I want 
information.” 

“I don’t know anything about a 
crystal.” 

“The information I want,” said 
the man in an inexorable voice, “is 
this: At any time recently have 
you had a thought about wishing 
you had taken a different path in 
life instead of ending up in 
Harkdale as a librarian?” 

E DITH’S mind flashed back to 
her series of impulses after she 
had mailed the crystal — and back 
farther. 

“Why, yes,” she breathed. 

“Tell me about one of them,” 
said the man. 

She told him of the impulse she 
had had to simply get on a bus or 
train and leave Harkdale. 

The man leaned back in the seat. 
He seemed surprisingly relaxed. 

He asked with a chuckle, “Are 
you the best of all possible Edith 
Prices?” 

Edith made no reply. She was 
beginning to have the feeling that 
perhaps she should confide in this 
man — should tell him where the 
crystal was. 

Athtar was speaking again. “I 
have a conviction that the Edith 



THE REFLECTED MEN 



55 




Price who is the twentieth-century 
orientation for the crystal is on 
that bus or is heading for safety 
somewhere else. And that there- 
fore you are under the same threat 
as I am — of being uncreated as 
soon as the crystal selects the per- 
fect Edith Price.” 

For Edith, terror began at that 
moment. 

During the minutes that fol- 
lowed she was only vaguely aware 
of words mumbling out of her 
mouth. 

Listening to her revelation, Ath- 
tar suppressed an impulse to 
murder her out of hand. He played 
it cautiously, thinking that if any- 
thing went wrong, this Edith was 
all he had to help him to trace the 
other Ediths. 

So he spoke reassuring words, 
put her out of the car, and watched 
her as she staggered off — safe, she 
thought. 

T HE note read: “He wasn’t 
there. It wasn’t there. The farm 
was deserted. Did you lie to me? 
Athtar.” 

Edith felt a chill the first time 
she read the words. Particularly 
she reacted to the last line with 
fear. But on her tenth or twelfth 
reading, she was more determined. 

She thought: If this whole crazy 
business is real I’d better — What? 

Be brave? Consider the problem? 
Act with decisiveness? 

It was Saturday. 

Before going to work she bought 



a small Browning .25 automatic at 
the Harkdale Hardware. She had 
often gone target practicing with 
the second of her two college boy 
friends, the one who had sold her 
on the philosophy that God was 
dead and that therefore one need 
only avoid jail — and otherwise do 
anything one pleased. Eventually 
he departed without marrying her, 
presumably feeling guiltless about 
having lured her away from a man 
who might have offered her a 
wedding ring. 

But this man did show her how 
to shoot an automatic firearm. 
She put the little pistol into her 
purse — and felt a hardening of her 
conviction that it was time this 
Edith started measuring up. 

One doubt remained: was 

willingness to shoot in self-defense 
a step forward — or a step 
away — from being the best of all 
possible Edith Prices? 

At the library that day, Tilsit 
was waiting for her with another 
news item: 

YOUNG FARMER MISSING 

Seth Mitchell, Abbotsville 
farmer, has not been at his 
farm for several days. A 
neighbor, Carey Grayson, 
called on Mitchell yesterday 
to buy seed grain, found the 
Mitchel cows unmilked, a 
horse in the stable starving, 
chickens unfed and no sign 
of life around the house.

Grayson fed the animals, 
then contacted Mitchell’s 
cousin in a neighboring 
county and notified the sher- 
iffs office. An investigation 
is under way. 

Edith handed back the paper 
with a meaningless comment. But 
she was thinking: So that's what 
A thtar discovered . 

In spite of her resolve she 
trembled. It seemed to her that 
there was no turning back; she 
must carry forward inexorably 
with all the thoughts that she had 
had. 

Sunday. 

She had driven to New York, 
and parked two blocks from the lit- 
tle hotel for women only where she 
had formerly lived. Surely, she told 
herself, that was where at least one 
Edith duplicate would have gone. 

From a phone booth she called 
the hotel and asked for Edith Price. 
There was a pause, then, “I’m ring- 
ing,” said the woman desk clerk. 

Instantly breathless, Edith hung 
up. She sagged limply inside the 
booth, eyes closed. It was not clear 
to her even now what she had ex- 
pected. 

Can it be that I'm the only Edith 
who knows that there are others? 
And does that give me an ad- 
vantage over the unknowing ones? 

Or was there already some- 
where an Edith Price who had 
naturally become the best of them 
all? 



Her thought ended. She realized 
that a short, stocky man was 
standing beside the booth, partly 
out of her line of vision. Something 
about him was familiar. 

She straightened and turned. 
Athtar. 

T HE Edith Price who stepped 
out of the phone booth was still 
shaky and still not brave. But two 
days of fear and threat and gulps of 
terror had transformed her. She 
had been a vaguely sad, wish-my- 
mistakes-won’t-doom-me young 
woman. Now she trembled with 
anxiety at times, but at other times 
she compressed her lips and had 
thoughts that were tough and re- 
alistic. 

The sight of Athtar caromed 
her into anxiety. 

Which was just as well, the tough 
part of her assessed realistically. 
She did not trust the worst of all 
possible Athtars. And he would 
feel safer with a frightened Edith, 
she was sure. 

Seen close in broad daylight on a 
deserted New York street on Sun- 
day morning, Athtar — short, 
broad, with a thick face and gray 
cheeks — was surprisingly as she 
remembered him — totally un- 
prepossessing. 

He said softly, “Why don’t you 
let me talk to her?” 

Edith scarcely heard. The first 
question of her 48-hour stop-only- 
for-sleep, stream of conscious- 
ness, siphoned through her voice, 



THE REFLECTED MEN 



57 




“Are you really from the thirty- 
fifth century?” 

He gave her a quick, shrewd 
look, must have realized how 
wound up she was and said recep- 
tively, “Yes.” 

“Are they all like you?” 

“It was decided,” said Athtar in 
a formal tone, “that a body built 
thicker and closer to the ground 
has more utility. That was several 
hundred years before I was born. 
And so, yes. No one is over sixteen 
hundred and seventy-five centi- 
meters — that is, five feet, six 
inches.” 

“How do you know you’re the 
worst of all possible Athtars?” 

“In my time,” was the reply, “it 
is a felony for anyone but a 
member of the Scientists’ Guild to 
have a weapon. Hence, political 
and economic power is part of the 
prize of the struggle for position in 
the Guild. On my way to be- 
coming a tougher member, I 
wished many times to be relatively 
safe among the faceless, unarmed 
masses. And the crystal, in creating 
other Athtars, solidified those 
wishes*” 

There was an implication here 
that getting tougher was not the 
answer, not the way. Edith sighed 
her disappointment and remem- 
bered her other questions. She told 
him about the two pictures she had 
seen in the crystal, the one of the 
solar system and the other the out- 
line of a human body. Did he know 
what the pictures meant? 



“When I first saw the crystal,” 
said Athtar, “the scene inside was 
of our galaxy. Later it became the 
solar system. So what you saw was 
probably a carryover from my 
time, where we occupy all the 
planets. And what I saw must 
derive from a time when man has 
moved out to the galaxy. It could 
mean that the crystal adjusts to 
the era in which it finds itself. 
Though why a human being in- 
stead of the planet Earth in this era 
is not obvious. Was the outline 
that of a woman or a man? 

Edith couldn’t remember. 

Standing- there in the bright, 
sunny day and on the dirty, nar- 
row street, Athtar shook his head. 
There was awe in his ugly face. He 
said wonderingly, “Such a small 
object; such a comprehensive 
ability.” He added, half to him- 
self, “It has to be based on 
potential flow patterns. There are 
not enough atoms in such a crystal 
to act as a control board for so 
much.” 

He had already, by implication, 
answered her next question but 
she asked it anyway. 

Athtar sighed, “No, the crystal 
is definitely not from the thirty- 
fifth century. It appeared 
suddenly. I picture it as having 
fallen backward through time 
from some future era in drops of 
fifteen hundred years.” 

“But why would they have sent 
it back?” Edith asked, bewildered. 
“What are they after?” 



58 



GALAXY 




The chunky little man gave her a 
startled look. “The idea of the 
crystal’s having been sent back for 
a purpose had not previously oc- 
curred to me. It’s such a colossally 
valuable machine that we assumed 
it got away from them acciden- 
tally,” he said. He was silent. 
Then, finally: “Why don’t you let 
me go to see this second Edith 
Price? And you go back to Hark- 
dale? If I find the crystal, I’ll re- 
port with it to you there.” 

The implication seemed to be 
that he planned to cooperate with 
her. What he meant was that the 
crystal would be no good to him 
until he had found and murdered 
the Edith to whom it was oriented. 

T HE tough part of Edith hesitat- 
ed at the idea of trusting this 
man. But it occurred to her that he 
might have his century’s weapons 
and that therefore he was being 
generous from a position of total 
strength in offering to cooperate. 

With such fear thoughts in her 
mind and having no plans of her 
own, she agreed. 

She watched him get into a 
shining new automobile and drive 
down the narrow street. It was a 
medium-sized car, she noted 
absently. She had never been one 
who kept track of auto designs, so 
by the time she wondered what 
make it was it was gone. Belatedly 
it also struck her that she ought to 
have looked at the license plate 
numbers. 



She thought sarcastically: What 
a third-rate Edith Price / am . 

She was vaguely aware of a car 
pulling up at the curb nearby. A 
young woman left it and casually 
walked toward her as if to go into 
the phone booth. 

She stopped suddenly beside 
Edith. 

“You’re Miss Price?” 

Edith turned. 

The other woman was a bright, 
alert blonde, probably in her 
thirties. Edith had never seen her 
before. She had no sense of being 
threatened but involuntarily she 
backed away several steps. 

“Yes,” she said. 

The woman turned toward the 
car and called, “Okay, Seth.” 

Seth Mitchell emerged from the 
car and came rapidly toward them. 
He was well dressed, like the Seth 
Mitchell in the gold Cadillac, but 
there was a subtle difference. His 
face had a firmer, more deter- 
mined expression. 

He said, “I’m a detective. Who 
is that man you were talking to?” 

And so the story, as well as Edith 
knew it, was presently shared. 

T HEY had gone into a coffee 
shop for their tense discussion. 
Edith was both relieved and 
disturbed to discover that these 
detectives had been in Harkdale 
for two days and had traced her 
down as a result of her call to the 
hospital to inquire about Billy 
Bingham. Having thus spotted her, 



THE REFLECTED MEN

they had become aware that the 
squat man was also keeping track 
of her movements. And so that 
morning, not one but three cars 
had headed for New York — 
Edith’s, Athtar’s and theirs. 

The exchange of information 
took time and several cups of 
coffee — though Edith rejected the 
final cup with the sudden realiza- 
tion that coffee was probably not 
good for people and that the 
crystal might judge her on it at 
some later time. She smiled wanly 
at how many restraints she was 
placing on herself! Exactly as if 
God were no longer dead. 

When they came out of the 
restaurant Seth Mitchell phoned 
the other Edith Price. He emerged 
from the phone booth uneasy. 

“The switchboard operator says 
that Miss Price left with a man 
about twenty minutes ago. I’m 
afraid we’re too late.” 

From Edith’s description he had 
already come to the conclusion 
that Athtar was a dangerous 
man. They decided to wait for the 
second Edith to return. But 
though they remained in New 
York until after eleven that night 
the young woman did not come 
back to her hotel. 

S HE never would return. For 
some hours, a bullet in her brain, 
her body, weighed down by stones, 
had been lying at the bottom of 
the East River. 

And Athtar had the crystal. 



To his intense disappointment, 
that Edith was not the crystal’s 
orientation. 

Accordingly, he spent the 
evening and a portion of the night 
fitting together parts in the 
construction of a special weapon. 
He had a peculiar prescience that 
he would need its power the fol- 
lowing day against the Edith who, 
he believed, was back in Hark- 
dale. 

V 

E DITH Price and the detec- 
tives set out for Harkdale in the 
two cars. Seth Mitchell, at Edith’s 
request, drove her car. Marge 
Aikens followed in the larger ma- 
chine. 

En route Mitchell told Edith that 
he believed she was the original 
Edith and that it was to her that the 
crystal was still oriented. He con- 
sidered also that her conclusion 
that Seth Mitchell, the farmer, 
was the worst Seth had doomed 
that unfortunate Mitchell dupli- 
cate. The crystal accepted her 
judgment and probably uncreated 
Seth, the farmer, when the pack- 
age with the crystal addressed to 
him had barely been deposited in 
the post office. 

Edith was taken aback by the de- 
tective’s logic. 

“But” she stammered, “I didn’t 
mean it that way.” Tears streamed 
down her cheeks. “Oh, that poor 
man!” 



60 



GALAXY 




“Of course you didn’t mean it,” 
Mitchell said. “Just to double- 
check — tell me again in what se- 
quence did that judgment of yours 
come? Was it before or after your 
various impulses to leave Hark- 
dale?” 

“Oh, after.” 

“And did I hear you 
correctly — you thought of going 
into the post office and asking for 
the package you had mailed to be 
returned to you?” 

“Yes, I had that thought.” She 
added; “But I didn’t do it.” 

“I would guess that at least one 
other Edith did go back and get it,” 
said Mitchell. 

“But it’s all so complicated,” 
Edith said. “How would any Edith 
just go, leaving clothes, money, 
car?” 

“I’ve been thinking of my own 
background on that,” said 
Mitchell. “Evidently the crystal 
can excise all confusions like that. 
For example, I never again even 
thought of going back to Hark- 
dale. To do so didn’t even cross 
my mind. But there are no blanks 
like that in your mind?” 

“None that 1 can identify or 
think of.” 

Seth Mitchell nodded. “That’s 
how I heard you. I think I’ve got 
the solution to this whole crazy 
business — and we don’t even have 
to know where the crystal is.” 

His reasoning was simple. In 
bringing back Billy Bingham at 
her command the crystal had 



deposited the boy nearly two miles 
away. At the time she had been 
holding the crystal in her hand. 
But her negative thought about 
Farmer Seth Mitchell had occurred 
after she had mailed the crystal and 
was approximately a hundred 
yards from the post office. 

So if she had indeed uncreated 
the mentally ill farmer, then the 
distance of the crystal’s human 
orientation — in this instance one 
of the Edith Prices — from the cry- 
stal, was not a factor. 

“You don’t agree?” asked the 
detective. 

“I’m thinking,” Edith said. 
“Maybe I’m not really the 
orientation.” 

“We’ll test that tomorrow.” 

“What about Athtar?” Edith 
asked. “I keep feeling that he may 
have special weapons. Besides, the 
crystal cannot affect him. What 
about that?” 

“Let me think about Athtar.” 

While he thought, Edith remem- 
bered Athtar’s asking her about the 
figure in the crystal: had it been a 
man’s or a woman’s? She sat there 
in the darkness next to this Seth 
Mitchell and became aware of two 
separate lines of thought in her 
mind. 

The first: she attempted to 
visualize the human design in the 
crystal. 

The second . 

S HE watched his profile as he 
drove. 



THE REFLECTED MEN

How brilliant he is — yet surely 
a mere detective, no matter how 
keen his logic, cannot be the best 
of all possible Seth Mitchells. A 
man in such a profession has got 
to be somewhere in the 
middle — which in this competition 
is the same as the worst . 

And he disappeared. 

For many seconds after she had 
that thought, the suddenly driver- 
less car held to its straight direc- 
tion. Its speed, which had been 
around seventy, naturally started 
to let up the instant there was no 
longer a foot on the accelerator. 

The only error came when Edith 
uttered a scream and grabbed at 
the wheel, turning it. The machine 
careened wildly. The next second 
she grasped it in a more steadying 
way and, holding it, slid along the 
seat into a position where 
presently she could apply the 
brake. She pulled over to the side 
of the road and stopped. 

Marge Aikens had slowed as 
soon as she saw there was a 
problem. She pulled up behind 
Edith, got out of the car and 
walked to the driver’s side of the 
other machine. 

“Seth,” she began, “what — ” 

Edith pushed the door open and 
stepped, trembling, out to the road. 
She had a mad impulse to 
run — anywhere. Her body felt 
strange. Her mind was encased in 
blank anguish. She was vaguely 
aware of herself babbling about 
what had happened. 



It must have taken a while for 
her incoherent words to reach 
through to Marge. But suddenly 
Marge gasped and Edith felt her- 
self grabbed by the shoulders. She 
was being shaken. 

A voice was yelling at her, “You 
stupid fool! You stupid fool — ” 

The shaking became pain. Her 
neck hurt, then her arms. 

I must be careful. I mustn't do or 
say anything that will affect her . 

With the thought Edith’s sanity 
returned. Marge was in a state of 
hysteria. The shaking was ac- 
tually an automatic act of a per- 
son out of her mind with grief. 

Edith knew pity. She was able to 
free herself by a simple action. 
She slapped Marge lightly on the 
cheek, once, twice, three times. The 
third time the woman let go of her 
and leaned against the car, sob- 
bing. 

A wind was blowing from the 
west. Car headlights kept glaring 
past them, lighting the scene brief- 
ly. The two women were now in a 
relatively normal state and pre- 
sently were able to discuss their 
situation. Edith tried to recreate 
Marge’s employer with the same 
command she had used to bring 
back Billy Bingham. 

She had had a feeling that it 
would not work — the Seth Mitch- 
ells were undoubtedly due to be 
eliminated one by one — and it did 
not. The minutes ticked by. 
Though she yelled the command 
in many variations into the night 



62 



GALAXY 




there was no sign of the vanished 
Seth, whose presence had for a 
long half-day brought to the whole 
situation the reassurance that 
derives from a highly intelli- 
gent and determined mind. 

In the end, defeated, the two 
women in their separate cars 
drove on to Harkdale. Marge had 
a room reserved at the Harkdale 
Hotel and went there. Edith drove 
wearily to the apartment house 
where she lived. 



I T WAS nearly four o’clock when 
she finally limped into her little 
suite. She lay down without un- 
dressing. She was drifting off to 
sleep when fear tensed her. Would 
the best of all possible Ediths be 
this sloppy about personal clean- 
liness? 

Literally hurting with exhaus- 
tion, she rolled off the bed, un- 
dressed, bathed, brushed her teeth, 
combed her hair, changed the lin- 
ens and stepped into a clean pair 
of pajamas. 

She awoke once with a bad start 
to the thought that conformity 
might not be her salvation. Such 
toiletry amenities as she had per- 
formed were products of early 
training and did not necessarily 
have anything to do with life as it 
should be lived. 

She fell asleep imagining a series 
of rebel Ediths, each one of whom 
had some special characteristic 
that was noble and worthy. 



The next time she awoke she saw 
daylight outside. It occurred to 
her that all her concepts, so 
compulsively visualized, were 
probably being created some- 
where by the crystal. Undoubted- 
ly there were already beatnik and 
hippie Ediths as well as rougher, 
tougher types. 

For the first time she realized 
what a strange whirl of possibili- 
ties she had considered in the last 
thirty-six hours. Ediths who were 
hard-boiled and could coldly shoot 
to kill, or, conversely, were super- 
feminine, sweet, tantalizing temp- 
tresses. 

“And it’s all unnecessary,” she 
whispered, lying there. “The de- 
cision will probably be made as 
arbitrarily as my own impulsive 
condemnation of the inarticulate 
farmer and the courageous — but 
presumably not perfect — detec- 
tive.” 

Having no standards that ap- 
plied to the twentieth century, the 
crystal had uncreated a power- 
ful and good man on the passing 
judgment of the person to whom 
it had by chance become oriented. 
Accordingly, the future looked 
grim for all Seth Mitchells and 
Edith Prices, including the origin- 
al. 

A S SHE dressed she looked 
through her window at the dis- 
tant blue waters of Lake Nara- 
gang and the downtown section 
that at one place, opposite the 



THE REFLECTED MEN 



63 




Harkdale Hotel, crowded the wa- 
ter’s edge. Pretty little town, 
Harkdale. She remembered that 
on her arrival she had thought that 
at least here she could be more 
casual in her dress than she had 
been in New York. Then she gave a 
short, rueful laugh — she had come 
full circle during the night, back 
to the notion that appearance 
would count. 

She put on her finest dress. Yet 
in some back closet of her brain 
lived a fearful conviction that all 
this was in vain. The crisis was im- 
minent; she might be dead — un- 
created — before this day was out. 

It seemed ridiculous to go to 
work on the day you were going to 
die. But she went. As she moved 
about her duties Edith was con- 
scious of her subdued manner. 
Twice, when she unthinkingly 
looked into the restroom mirror, 
she was startled by the pale face 
and sick eyes that looked back at 
her. 

This is not really me — / can't be 
judged on this . 

Surely the crystal would not re- 
ject her because she was in a daze. 
Every passing minute fleeting 
images of other Ediths passed be- 
fore her mind’s eye. Each one had 
in it the momentary hope that 
maybe it held the key to the best. 
There was Edith living out her life 
as a nun; another chaste Edith, 
married but holding sex to a 
minimum, placing all her atten- 
tion on her children, and an Edith 



who was a follower of Zen Bud- 
dhism. 

She had, earlier, put through a 
call to Marge Aiken, at the Hark- 
dale Hotel. About two o’clock 
Marge called back. She reported 
that she had phoned New York and 
discovered that the second Edith 
had not returned to her hotel at 
all the previous night. 

After imparting this grim news, 
Marge said, “If Athtar contacts 
you — don’t be alone with him un- 
der any circumstances until he 
produces the Seth Mitchell in the 
gold Cadillac and the Edith in 
New York.” 

After that call more images, 
mostly of saintly and good- 
hearted, unsophisticated Ediths 
haunted her. 

Into this haze of thoughts, 
Tilsit’s voice intruded: “Phone call 
for you, Edith.” 

She picked up the phone, heard a 
familiar voice — Athtar’s. 

“I want to see you right after 
work.” 

Edith said on a suddenly faint 
note, “At the Harkdale Ho- 
tel — in the lobby.” 

VI 

A THTAR left the phone booth. 

>A smile twisted his wide face. 
For him there were two possibil- 
ities of victory now that he had the 
crystal. 

The first was to kill its current 
orientation — Edith. He intended 



64 



GALAXY 




to take no chances with her. She 
would never, he resolved, reach the 
Harkdale Hotel. 

However, murder of his only 
Edith left one unpleasant possi- 
bility. Though he had reasoned it 
out that she was the crystal’s 
orientation — should she prove not 
to be, in destroying her-^-he would 
remove his source of information 
for tracing other Ediths. 

It was a considered risk he had 
to take. As a precaution he had 
already removed the crystal from 
the nutrient soil on which it fed. He 
was not certain how long it would 
be before the stone was de- 
activated by starvation, but he 
deduced not more than two weeks. 
Whereupon it would orient to 
whoever reactivated it. To himself, 
of course. 

Now that he had a special 
barrier-penetrating weapon, he 
firmly believed that before this 
day was over he would be in sole 
possession of the most remarkable 
machine of all time and space— the 
crystal. 

T HE Harkdale Hotel was a sum- 
mer resort hostelry. Its prices 
were high and as a result it had 
made money. Some of the money 
had been spent wisely, on decora- 
tion, fine furniture and a sophisti- 
cated staff. 

The clerk on day duty had his 
own definition of a sophisticate: 
a person with a memory so good 
that he can forget with discretion. 



He was such a peron. His name 
was Derek Slade. And so discreet 
was he that on this fateful day he 
had allowed four Seth Mitchells to 
register without comment. He 
believed each Mitchell to be the 
same man but with a different 
woman and he was just beginning 
to enjoy the situation when Seth 
Mitchell arrived for the fifth 
time — this time without a woman. 

Yet it took Derek only a 
moment to figure it out. This 
smooth male, Seth Mitchell, had 
four women in different rooms 
and evidently wanted a separate 
room for himself. Why? Derek did 
not try to analyze the matter 
further. Life — he had often 
said — was full of surprises. 

He spoke in a low tone, “You 
may count on my discretion, Mr. 
Mitchell.” 

The Seth Mitchell across the 
desk from him raised his eye- 
brows, then nodded with a faint 
smile. 

Derek was pleased. The remark 
ought to be good for a twenty- 
dollar tip. 

He was still congratulating him- 
self when the elevator door opened 
and another Seth Mitchell stepped 
out and walked toward the desk. 
As he came up, the Seth Mitchell 
who had just registered turned to 
follow the bellboy carrying his 
bags to the elevator. 

The two Seth Mitchells almost 
bumped into each other. Both 
took evasive action. Both mur- 



THE REFLECTED MEN 



65 




mured polite, nothings and were 
about to pass each other when 
Derek recovered. 

It was one of his perfect 
moments. He raised his voice, 
spoke with exactly the correct note 
of authority. 

“Mr. Mitchell.” 

The two Seth Mitchells were 
already in a mildly confused state. 
Their name, uttered in that 
peremptory tone, stopped them. 

Derek said, “Mr. Seth Mitchell, 
may I present Mr. Seth Mitchell. 
Gentlemen, please wait there a 
moment.” 

He let them kill their own 
time — one seemed to recover 
quickly; the other remained be-' 
wildered — while he phoned the 
rooms of the previously registered 
Seth Mitchells. He had to call all 
four rooms but presently before 
him stood five Seth Mitchells. 

Of all the people present the one 
most completely unnoticed was 
Derek Slade. He would not have 
had it any other way. 

Four of the five Seths were 
gulping and stuttering at each 
other. The fifth had stepped to one 
side with a faint smile. Almost as 
one, the four suddenly became 
embarrassed. 

Derek’s cool voice reached them 
with perfect timing. 

“Gentlemen, let me show you to 
the conference room, where you 
may talk over this whole matter.” 

As they started for the 
conference room, Marge Aiken 



entered the hotel in time to catch a 
profile view of the last Seth 
Mitchell walking into the room. 
She paled, then rushed forward. 

“Seth — ” she cried out tear- 
fully. “For God’s sake, I thought 
you were dead — ” 

She stopped. She had grabbed 
the nearest man by the arm. He 
turned and something unfamiliar 
about him flustered her. 

A FTER all the Mitchells had been 
briefed by Marge to the extent 
of her knowledge she suggested 
that Edith be called to come over 
at once. 

Three Seth Mitchells presented 
their view. Listening to each in 
turn, Marge glanced along the line 
of sensationally familiar faces and 
saw in all but one man’s eyes a 
haunting apprehension — and the 
equally haunting intelligence she 
had seen so often in her employer’s. 

Seth from Montreal said, “Our 
first act must be to protect our- 
selves from that young woman’s 
automatic judgments, such as she 
rendered on farmer Mitchell and 
detective Mitchell.” 

A second, slightly deeper-voiced 
Seth was concerned about Athtar. 
“In killing Edith Price Number 
Two, Athtar must have gotten the 
crystal and then discovered that 
the dead Edith was not the orien- 
tation. Therefore our initial act 
must be to protect the Edith who 
is the orientation. The first real 
problem is to get her safely to the 



66 



GALAXY 




hotel — not what she may do when 
she gets here.” 

The third Seth said the problem 
was not so much Edith’s judgment 
of men; it was her stereotyped 
concept of women. Presumably, 
the crystal had dutifully created a 
long list of Edith Prices who were 
simply ordinary human beings with 
varying moral standards or with 
slightly different beliefs about how 
to get along in the drab world of 
the twentieth century. 

“As an example of how dif- 
ferently I would want her to handle 
her control, of the crystal — one of 
the first Edith Prices I would wish 
her to create is one that has ESP. 
Why? So that she can understand 
this whole situation and what to 
do about it.” 

His words brought a hopeful 
reaction. It was an obviously good 
idea — if it could be done. 

A fourth Seth, who had sat gray 
and silent, now said, “It would be 
interesting if such ESP ability 
included being able to spot the Seth 
Mitchell who — ” he nodded at 
Marge — “paid your boss a 
thousand dollars to locate the 
crystal.” 

The Seth who had arrived at the 
hotel without a wife — and who 
had reflected none of the fear that 
the others felt — stirred and smiled 
cheerfully. 

“You need look no further. I’m 
he.” 

When order had been restored he 
continued: “To answer your basic 



question, I also dreamed — as you 
all did — and exactly as the worst 
Athtar found himself with the 
address of one of the Seth 
Mitchells in his mind, one morn- 
ing after a dream the address of 
detective Mitchell was in mine.” 
“But why didn’t you come for 
the crystal yourself? Why pay a 
thousand dollars?” 

The bachelor Mitchell smiled 
again. “I hate to tell you people 
this — and it is to your advantage 
not to let Miss Price know — but 
according to the thoughts I had 
after my dream I am the best of all 
possible Seth Mitchells.” 

Once more he had to wait for 
order. 

Then: “I don’t know why I’m 
best. But I hired someone to come 
here in my place because I sensed 
danger and I came here today be- 
lieving that this was the crisis. I 
can’t tell you what I’ll do about it. I 
don’t even have the feeling that my 
role is decisive. I simply believe 
that a challenge will present itself 
and I’ll meet it.” He finished 
simply: “I don’t think we should 
devote any more time to me. We 
have many vital things to do and 
we only have until Edith Price 
comes off the job to get them 
done. Let’s go. First, since vio- 
lence is imminent, we must warn 
the police — ” 

T HE police of Harkdale were 
few in number and Athtar was 
able to drive into town and into 



THE REFLECTED MEN

the library parking lot without 
being observed. A lingering twi- 
light had barely begun to turn to 
night when Edith emerged. 

She noted with a vague surprise 
that a town fire truck, engine 
running, was standing near the 
door. But she was already having 
qualms about the forthcoming 
journey to the hotel — so far away, 
it seemed to her suddenly. So the 
sight of the big truck was reassur- 
ing. 

To get to her own car, she had to 
go around the fire truck. As she 
started to do so the big machine 
surged into motion with a gigantic 
thunder of its engine. Edith 
stopped, teetered, then leaped 
back. The truck jammed on its 
brakes directly in front of her. 

Somewhere beyond the big 
machine a purple flash had lighted 
the sky. Like a tracer bullet the 
light flashed from the auto to the 
fire truck. As it hit, it made a 
sound of a pitch never before 
heard on earth — a deep, sustained, 
continuing protest of chemical 
bonds by the quadrillion snapping 
in metal. 

The tiny bullet penetrated the 
thick steel frame of the fire truck, 
and reformed itself a micromilli- 
meter at a time from the steel 
molecules. It did not slow as it 
passed through the heavy machine. 
It would also have passed straight 
through Edith, except that its speed 
was that of a bullet — immense but 
finite. 



It transited the fire truck while 
the truck was still in motion. The 
bullet was carried along inside the 
moving vehicle during a measur- 
able fraction of a second and 
missed Edith by inches. 

Unchecked, it struck the library 
wall, moved through, emerged 
from the far side and streaked into 
the night. Its kinetic energy being 
a precise quality, it bored forward 
another hundred yards and then 
rapidly fell. 

Moments later two plainclothes 
police discharged their rifles at the 
figure that was dimly visible inside 
the car from which the purple- 
glowing bullet had been fired. 

The screech of bullets striking 
his own machine startled Athtar. 
But he had taken the precaution of 
using a molecular reinforcing unit 
to harden the glass and the metal 
of the auto, so the bullets failed to 
penetrate. 

What bothered him was that he 
only had a few bullets and in the 
dark he could not gauge the extent 
of the trap that had been set for 
him. So now, hastily, he put his car 
into drive, stepped on the gas and 
drove rapidly out of the parking 
lot. 

A police car fell in behind him, 
flashing its red beacon. Though it 
or its weapons were no danger to 
Athtar, he feared a roadblock. He 
turned up several side streets and in 
only a few minutes of driving lured 
the police car onto a street near the 
lake on the far side of the Hark- 



68 



GALAXY 




dale Hotel, an approach he had 
thoroughly explored on foot. 

Satisfied, he opened the car 
window on the driver’s side, 
slowed, leaned out, looked back, 
took quick aim at the engine of the 
other machine and put a purple- 
glowing bullet through the crank- 
case. There was a shattering crash. 
The stricken motor almost tore it- 
self apart, screaming metallically. 
The auto itself came to a bumpy 
halt. 

A THTAR hurriedly circled back 
■to the Harkdale Hotel. The first 
queasy doubt had come to him that 
for a reason not yet clear his time 
was running out. Yet it still seemed 
true to him that all he need do was 
sneak into the hotel and discharge 
a single bullet at one, and only one, 
beating heart. 

Minutes later, after squeezing 
through a kitchen window of the 
hotel, he found himself in a 
shadowy storeroom on a concrete 
floor. As he fumbled his way to a 
door, he had a fleeting mental 
image of his colleagues of the great 
Science Guild viewing him in such 
a lowly action. Of course, Athtar 
told himself scornfully, what they 
thought would not matter once he 
had control of the crystal. There 
would be dramatic changes after he 
got back to his own time — a few 
hundred Guild members were 
scheduled for extermination. 

Cautiously he pulled open a 
door. As he started through the 



hallway beyond it he became 
aware of a faint sound behind him. 
He spun around and jerked up his 
gun. 

Instant, unbearable pain in his 
arm forced the gun down and his 
finger away from the trigger. Al- 
most at once the gun dropped from 
his nerveless hand, clattering to 
the floor. Even as he recognized 
that 35th-century technology was 
being used against him, he: saw that 
a short, squat man was standing in 
the doorway of the storeroom he 
himself had just left. 

Athtar’s arm and hand were now 
inexorably forced by intolerable 
pain to reach into his inside breast 
pocket, take out the crystal and 
hold it out to the other man. 

The second Athtar did not 
speak. He drew the door shut 
behind him, accepted the crystal 
and, bending down, picked up the 
gun from the floor. Then he edged 
past his prisoner, stepped through 
the door beyond and closed it be- 
hind him also. 

At once, all the muscle pres- 
sures let go of the worst Athrar. 
Instantly desperate, he tried to jerk 
open the storeroom door. The 
door did not yield — it had an un- 
nervingly solid feel to it. Athtar 
whirled toward the other door. 

When he found it also presented 
that same solid resistance to his 
tug he finally recognized that he 
was trapped by molecular forces 
from his own era. There was noth- 
ing to do as the minutes lengthen- 



THE REFLECTED AAEN

ed but sit down on the concrete 
floor and wait. 

Sitting there, he knew a mixed 
reaction to his realization that the 
drama of the crystal would now 
play on without him. What 
seemed good about it was the 
distinct conviction that the game 
was more dangerous than he had 
let himself believe. He had 
recognized his assailant as the best 
of all possible Athtars. 

Too, the Price woman was being 
cleverer than he had anticipated. 
Which meant that the automatic 
programing of the crystal to un- 
create all but the best would force 
her to the most desperate actions. 
Or so it seemed to the worst 
Athtar. 

Better not to be around when 
such extreme events were trans- 
piring. 

T HE best of all possible Athtars 
walked through the hotel lobby 
to the conference room. The five 
Seth Mitchells were grouped out- 
side the door, out of the line of 
vision of Edith, who was inside. 
Athtar gave the agreed-on signal 
and handed the worst Athtar’s 
automatic pistol to one of the 
Seths. They were thorough. They 
searched him and then passed him 
on to Marge Aikens, who stood in 
the doorway. 

To Marge, Athtar gave another 
agreed-on signal. Having thus 
established his identity as the 
friendly Athtar, whom Edith had 



recreated as a first step, he was 
now admitted into the room. 

Athtar placed the crystal on the 
conference table in front of Edith. 
As her fingers automatically 
reached toward it, he placed a 
restraining hand on her wrist. 

“I have a feeling,” he ad- 
monished, “that this time when 
you pick it up — when the true 
orientation, you, picks it up — that 
will be the moment of crisis.” 

His voice and his words, seemed 
far away. She had — it seemed to 
her — considered those thoughts, 
and had those feelings, in 
approaching the decision to re- 
create him — the best Athtar. That, 
also, had been a crisis. 

As she nevertheless hesitated 
out of respect for his knowledge 
and awareness, Edith noticed two 
impulses within herself. One was 
to go into a kind of exhaustion, in 
which she would act on the basis 
that she was too tired to think all 
that through again. 

The second impulse was a 
clearer, sharper awareness, which 
had come to her suddenly at the 
library after she realized that the 
worst Athtar had tried his best to 
kill her. 

Abruptly, then, the problems 
that had disturbed her earlier had 
faded. Whether it was better to be 
tough and be able to shoot or be 
soft and feminine, had no mean- 
ing. The real solution was infinite 
flexibility, backed by unvarying 
intention. 



70 



GALAXY 




One handled situations. That 
was all there was to it. 

As she remembered that perfect 
thought the impulse toward 
exhaustion went away. She turned 
to Marge and said matter-of- 
factly, “Shall I tell him what we 
discussed while he was down in the 
storeroom?” 

Marge nodded tensely. 

Athtar listened with what 
appeared to be an expression of 
doubt, then said, “Having the 
crystal recreate one of its makers 
could be exactly what those makers 
are waiting for you to do.” 

“That’s exactly what we 
thought,” said Edith. And still she 
felt no fear. She explained, “Our 
thought is that, since the crystal is 
programed to find the best of each 
person, and the best Athtar turned 
out to be a reasonable person and 
not a criminal, then the makers of 
the crystal understand the dif- 
ference. We may therefore assume 
that the society of the future is 
normal and will not harm us.” She 
added: “That’s why we recreated 
you — as a check.” 

“Good reasoning,” said Athtar. 
“But I sense there’s something 
wrong with it.” 

“But you have no specific 
thought?” she asked. 

“No.” He hesitated, then 
shrugged. “As a start,” he said, 
“why not pick up the crystal — just 
pick it up — and see if my feeling 
about that gesture’s being suffi- 
cient has any substance?” He 



explained, “If I’m wrong there we 
can dismiss my doubts.” 

“You don’t want me to look at 
the design?” 

The Seths had decided that her 
awareness of the design was the 
key to her control of the stone. 

Athtar answered, “No, I sense 
that they’re ready.” 

His words, the implication of ul- 
tra-perception that reached over, 
perhaps thousands of years, star- 
tled Edith and held her unmoving 
— but only momentarily. 

She fought free. 

“The truth is,” said Edith aloud, 
completing her thought, “we all 
feel that we have no alternative 
left to us.” 

Without further delay she 
reached forward and picked up the 
crystal. 

She gasped. 

The man who walked out of the 
corner of the room, where he had 
materialized, was a giant. Seven, 
eight, nine feel — her mind kept re- 
assessing the height, as she strove 
to adjust to the enormous reality 
of him. 

The size, the blue harness cloth- 
ing — like a Roman centurion 
guard in summer uniform — the 
bronze body, the large face with 
eyes as black as coal, unsmiling 
and firm; and in his bearing, con- 
scious power unqualified by doubt 
or fear. 

He said in a bass voice, in 
English, “I am Shalil, the best of 
all possible.” 



THE REFLECTED MEN

VII 

F OR a long moment Edith waited 
for him to complete the 
sentence. She presumed that the 
final word would be his name. At 
last, with a shock, she realized the 
sentence was finished. The crystal 
makers had sent the most quali- 
fied individual of their entire race 
to handle this situation. 

In the doorway, Marge cringed 
away from the monster. She 
uttered a small cry. At the sound, 
two of the Seth Mitchells rushed 
into the room. They caught Marge, 
who seemed close to hysteria and 
fainting — and they also saw the 
apparition. The other three Seths 
crowded into the doorway. 

As of one accord, obviously un- 
wisely and therefore — as Edith 
realized later — under a volition not 
their own, they moved into the 
room, bringing Marge with them. 
The Seth who brought up the rear 
pulled the door shut behind him. 

The best Athtar stirred and said 
in a sharp tone, “Miss Price — un- 
create him! He does not mean 
well.” 

The giant grimaced. “You 
cannot uncreate me. I and only 
I — now control the crystal. The 
term ‘mean well’ is relative. I 
mean well for my own time and my 
own group.” He glanced over the 
five Seths and the two women, then 
settled on Athtar. “Which of you 
are the biologically original 
human beings?” he asked. 



Edith clutched the crystal and 
glanced uncertainly at the Seths, 
silently appealing for suggestions. 
But they were staring at the giant 
and seemed oblivious to her. 

Yet one of them asked abruptly, 
“Athtar, in what way doesn’t he 
mean well?” 

Athtar shook his head. “I don’t 
know in details,” he said un- 
happily. “But I have a feeling. 
They sent the crystal back here for 
their purpose. His question about 
original human beings points a 
significant direction. But don’t 
answer it — or any other question 
he may ask.” 

It seemed a small, useless 
denial. The huge man strode to the 
door. The group of Seths let him 
through automatically. The giant 
opened the door and peered out in- 
to the hotel lobby. After a single, 
swift survey, he pushed the door 
shut again and faced about. 

“I deduce,” he said, “that the 
people of this era are the originals. 
They are the ones we want for our 
experiments.” 

Athtar said tautly to the Seths, 
“One of you has the worst Athtar’s 
gun. Shoot him.” 

The instant the words were 
spoken the pistol floated into view, 
avoided the fingers of the two 
Seths who tried to seize it. It settled 
into Shalil’s palm. He slipped the 
weapon into a pocket of his simple 
garment. 

The best Athtar glanced at 
Edith. He said glumly, “I’ve done 



72 



GALAXY 




my best — ” and faced the mon- 
ster. “What happens to me?” 

T IHE black eyes studied him. 

“The crystal is communicating 
data to me,” Shalil said. “You and 
the other Athtar are from an era 
where the people have already 
been biologically altered?” 

Athtar glanced apologetically at 
Edith. “1 see no additional danger 
in asking him a question since he 
already seems .to have all the 
information we possess.” With- 
out waiting for a reply he addressed 
the huge man: “The decision made 
in the thirty-first century, nearly 
four hundred years before my 
time, was that small, heavy bodies 
had more survival potential than 
tall, thin ones. I see that in your era 
a much taller, bigger, more power- 
ful man than any we have even 
imagined, is the norm. What is the 
rationale?” 

“Different problems,” answered 
Shalil. “In my era, which by your 
reckoning would correlate to the 
ninety-third century, man is a 
space creature.” He broke off. 
“Since we have no interest in you 
at present, I propose to send you 
and the other Athtar back to your 
own time.” 

“Wait — ” The best Athtar spoke 
urgently. “What do you intend to 
do with these people?” He waved 
toward Edith and the Seths. 

Shalil grimaced. “What we 
actually want for our experiments 
are the best Seth Mitchell and the 



best Edith Price. The others are 
free to go. We set the crystal to find 
the best specimens.” 

“But why?” 

“Something has gone wrong. We 
need to restudy human origins.” 

“Do you need these specific 
persons or will you merely have 
the crystal duplicate them in your 
own era?” 

“Only one of each exists. If he 
and she are created in any other 
time they become uncreated here.” 

“What will you do? Dissect 
them?” 

“In the end, perhaps. The experi- 
menters will decide.” Sharply. 
“Never mind that. The program is 
laid out and the subjects are 
urgently needed.” His voice grew 
imperious. “Miss Price, give me 
the crystal. We are not needlessly 
cruel and I wish to send the Athtars 
home.” 

Athtar urged, “Miss Price, don’t 
give it to him. His statement that 
he totally controls the crystal may 
not be true until the moment he 
has possession of it. These far- 
future beings must be persuaded to 
accept another, less arbitrary 
solution to their problem.” 

Edith had been standing, watch- 
ing the fantastic giant, listening to 
the infinite threat that was 
developing out of his blunt words. 
Suddenly what had seemed an 
utterly desirable goal — to be the 
best — had become the most un- 
desirable. 

But she was- not yet afraid. Her 



THE REFLECTEDMEN 



73 




mind was clear. The tumbling 
thoughts and feelings of the past 
days, which had suddenly fallen 
into an exact order in her mind 
earlier that night, remained 
orderly. 

Her own reaction was that 
Athtar was wrong and that she 
had, in fact, lost control of the 
crystal. It seemed obvious to her 
that the crystal’s makers would 
have had some pre-emptive system 
by which they could regain its use 
at a key moment. 

But she intended to test her 
theory. 

She glanced at and into the 
crystal and said firmly, “Whoever 
can defeat this giant — be here 
now?” 



M OMENTS after she had 

spoken, the crystal was 

snatched from her fingers by the 
same kind of unseen force as had 
taken the automatic pistol from 
one of the Seths earlier. She 
watched helplessly as it also float- 
ed over to the giant’s palm. The 
huge man’s black eyes gleamed 
triumphantly at her. 

“All your allies are in this room. 
There is nobody else.” 

“In that case,” said a man’s 
voice quietly, “I imagine that, re- 
gardless of consequences, my 
moment has come.” 

The bachelor Seth Mitchell 
strode forward to confront the 
giant. 



There was a long pause. Edith 
had time to assess this Seth and to 
savor the simple, strong human- 
ity that he represented. She saw 
that he was well dressed in a dark 
gray suit, that his lean face was 
firm, his eyes calm and fearless. In 
some depths of her mind she was 
proud that at this moment such a 
Seth Mitchell existed. Yet, though 
she was still not afraid herself, she 
was aware of her hopes sinking. 

The silence ended. 

The great being from the future 
said, “I hope you realize that you 
are condemning the other Seths in 
forcing your identity on me in this 
manner. In this era the crystal has 
no alternative but to uncreate 
them.” 

Behind Edith, Marge cried out 
faintly. 

Edith whirled. Marge seemed to 
be choking. Edith ran to her, put an 
arm around her waist. 

“What’s the matter?” 

Marge continued to choke. Her 
words, when they finally came, 
were almost inaudible: “They’re 
gone^the other Seths — ” 

Edith looked around. Where the 
four Seths had been standing near 
the door— there was no one. She 
had an impulse to run to the door 
and look out. Surely they had 
simply stepped outside for a mo- 
ment. 

Abruptly she realized. They had 
been uncreated. 

She uttered a gasping sob — then 
caught herself as Seth Mitchell 



74 



GALAXY 




spoke in the same quiet tone as be- 
fore. 

“I said, regardless of con- 
sequences.” He glanced back at the 
two women. “Since the Seths re- 
main crystal patterns, they’re no 
more in danger now than they 
would be if this creature were able 
to carry out all his threats. That 
probably even applies to the Seth 
of the gold Cadillac and the Edith 
who presumably was killed in New 
York.” To Shalil he said, “I think 
you’d better send the Athtars into 
their own time.” 

There was an ever so slight 
pause; the giant’s eyes changed 
slightly, as if he were thinking. 

Then: “It’s done,” he said. 

Edith glanced to where Athtar 
had been. With a conscious effort 
she retained her self-control. 

Athtar had disappeared. 

Shalil surveyed the best of all 
possible Seth Mitchells, said, “You 
really benefited from the crystal, 
didn’t you?” He spoke in his softest 
bass. An intent, listening ex- 
pression came into his face. “You 
own — one — three, four corpora- 
tions.” 

“I stopped when I was worth ten 
million,” said the best Seth. He 
turned to look apologetically at 
Edith. “I couldn’t imagine having 
use for even that much money. But 
I had set it as a goal and reached 
it.” Without waiting for her 
reaction he once more faced the 
gigantic enemy. “All the Seth 
Mitchells,” he said, “are the results 



of a boy’s dreams, based on what 
information he had. He un- 
doubtedly had observed that there 
are tax experts, lawyers, doctors, 
tramps and policemen. And in a 
town like Harkdale he was aware 
of summer resort visitors — and on 
the level of a boy’s daydreams 
there existed— until they were un- 
created just now — a cowboy Seth 
Mitchell, an African hunter Seth, a 
sea captain, an airline pilot and 
probably even a few glamorous 
criminals — ” He broke off. “I have 
a feeling you don’t under- 
stand — you don’t have any boys 
any more where you are, do you?” 

VIII 

T HE giant’s eyes shifted uncer- 
tainly. 

He said, “We are crystal dupli- 
cates. Thus we shall presumably 
live forever — if we can solve the 
present tendency of the cells to be 
tired.” He added reluctantly: 
“What’s a boy?” 

“Maybe there’s your problem,” 
said Seth Mitchell. “You’ve for- 
gotten about children. Gene 
variation.” The best Seth con- 
tinued to gaze up at the great 
being. “I’m the creation,” he said 
gently, “of a boy who, for a long 
time after Bill Bingham dis- 
appeared, was under exceptional 
adult pressure and criticism and as 
a result had many escape fantasies. 
Picture that boy’s fantasy of total 
power — somebody who would 



THE REFLECTED MEN 



75 




handle mean adults who acted as if 
he were lying and who treated him 
nastily — some day he would show 
them all. How? The answer would 
not have been clear to the boy Seth 
who felt that resentment. But 
when the time came he knew he 
would know how — and of course he 
wouldn’t be mean about it the way 
the adults had been. There would 
be a kind of nobility about his total 
power.” 

The two men, the best of all 
possible Seth Mitchells from the 
twentieth century, and the best of 
all possibles from the ninety-third 
century were standing within a 
few feet of each other. 

“Perhaps,” the best Seth 
addressed the giant softly, “you 
can tell better than I what the 
crystal would create out of such a 
command.” 

“Since nobility is involved,” 
was the harsh reply, “I feel that I 
can safely test that boy’s fantasy to 
the uttermost limit.” 

He spoke sharply, uncommand- 
ingly, in a strange language. 

Edith had listened to the deadly 
interchange, thinking in a won- 
dering dismay: God really is dead! 
These future people have never 
even heard of Him . 

Her thought ended. For the 
giant’s deep bass tones had sudden- 
ly ceased. 

Something hit her deep inside 
her body. Around her the room 
dimmed. 

As if from a vast distance she 



heard Seth Mitchell say apolo- 
getically: “Only thing I know. 
Miss Price, is to send you along 
with him. Seems you’ve got the 
solution in what you just thought, 
whatever that was. The crystal will 
make it real. Hope it works.” 

A moment after that she was 
falling into infinity. 

T HE body of Edith lay on a con- 
tour rest-space in one corner of 
the crystal administrative center. 
Periodically a giant walked over 
to her and routinely checked the 
instruments that watched over her 
and monitored the invisible force 
lines that held her. 

A slow night went by. A new day 
finally dawned. The sunlight that 
suffused the translucent walls al- 
so revealed half a dozen giants, in- 
cluding Shalil, gathered around the 
slowly breathing — but otherwise 
unmoving — body of the young 
woman from the twentieth cen- 
tury. 

To wake or not to wake her? 

They discussed the problem in 
low, rumbling voices. Since they 
were all scientists, capable of 
appreciating the most subtle 
nuances of logic, what bothered 
them was that the small female 
presented a paradox. 

Outward appearance said she 
was helpless. Shalil had been able 
to put Edith into a coma. At the 
instant of the best Seth’s command 
to the crystal and she had arrived in 



76 



GALAXY 




that degraded condition in the 
ninety-third century. 

Or rather, she had been un- 
created in her own time and had 
been recreated by the crystal in 
Shalil’s time, already uncon- 
scious. She herself had not had 
any control over her own destiny. 

What disturbed her captors was 
that an undefinable power 
radiated from her — and had ever 
since her recreation. The power 
was not merely ordinary. It was 
total. 

Total power? Absolute and un- 
qualified? How could that be? 

Once more they gave attention 
on both hearing and telepathic 
levels, as Shalil repeated his 
account of what had transpired 
while he had been in the twentieth 
century. The story, already 
familiar, reiterated the same peak 
moments: the ordinariness, the un- 
threatening aspect, of all the 
people of the past whom Shalil had 
confronted. 

Again they were told the 
climax — when the best Seth had 
assumed that the crystal would 
evolve an unusual energy con- 
figuration out of a boy’s fantasies 
of power. Clearly — at least, it was 
clear to the huge men — the 
crystal’s response to Seth’s 
command established that it had 
been oriented to the best Seth. And 
that its energies had been 
mobilized for later expression, 
when the original Seth Mitchell 



had been a boy. From that energy 
response by the crystal alone the 
giants reasoned unhappily: 
“There is more potential in these 
crystals than we have hitherto be- 
lieved.” 

And how could that be? 

But there was even worse. 

W HILE giving his command 
to Edith the best of possible 
Seth Mitchells had implied that he 
had received a feedback message 
from her, presumably by way of 
the crystal, indicating that she 
would all by herself now be able to 
defeat the entire science of the 
ninety-third century. 

Once Shalil took control of the 
crystal, such a feedback of 
information — whether true or 
false — should not have occurred. 
And Seth’s command, by any 
known scientific analysis, was im- 
possible. 

True, they did not know all there 
was to know about the crystals. 
Several unexplained areas were 
still being researched. But it had 
long been argued that nothing 
major remained to be discovered. 

The present implication was 
that original, unmanipulated 
human beings might have special 
qualities that had been lost to their 
biologically manipulated descen- 
dants. 

A giant grunted, “I think we 
should kill her.” 

A second huge man growled an 



THE REFLECTED MEN 



77 




objection. He argued. “If the 
attempt to destroy her should bring 
a reaction from the absolute 
power that radiates from her, that 
reaction would be uncontrollable. 
Much better to deduce on the basis 
of Shalil’s report the low-level 
ways in which her mind functions, 
awaken her and inexorably force 
responses from her.” 

Everybody thought that was a 
good idea. 

“And if something goes wrong,” 
one giant rumbled, “we can al- 
ways render her unconscious again 
through instantaneous uncreation 
and recreation by the crystal.” 
Shalil reminded gruffly, “What 
about that odd decision she had 
reached in her attempt to be the 
best of all possible Ediths, to 
handle situations with infinite 
flexibility?” 

Contempt greeted the remark. 
“With her lifetime conditioning,” 
one huge scientist said, “she 
couldn’t possibly deal with each 
situation according to its merits. 
She cannot even know what the 
real issues of a situation are.” 

The discussion ended on a 
decision that when Edith was 
awakened she should seem to her- 
self to be completely free . 

S HE was lying on grass. It 
touched her fingers and her face. 
The fresh smell of it was in her 
nostrils. 

Edith opened her eyes and 
simultaneously raised her head. 



Wilderness. A primeval forest. A 
small brown animal with a bushy 
tail scurried into the brush, as she 
climbed hastily to her feet, re- 
membering. 

She saw the giant, Shalil, in the 
act of picking himself up fifteen 
feet to her left. He seemed slow 
about it, as if he were groggy. 

The day was misty. The sun still 
stood high in the sky. To her right, 
partly visible through foilage, was 
a great, gray hill of soil. To her left 
the land fell away and the mist was 
thicker. After a hundred yards it 
was an almost impenetrable fog. 

Almost, but not quite, impene- 
trable. Vaguely visible through it 
was a building. 

Edith faced the giant squarely 
and asked, “Where are we?” 

Shalil gazed at her warily. It was 
hard for him to realize that she did 
not intuitively know. He found it 
almost unacceptable that along- 
side her infinite power was such 
nadir thinking. 

Yet, as she continued to stand 
there, facing him, he sensed her 
concern. And so, reluctantly, he 
decided that the first conclusions 
reached by his colleagues and him- 
self continued to apply. They had 
perceived her to be motivated by 
involuntary attitudes and for- 
gotten memories, each psychically 
as solid as a bar of steel. All her life 
she had followed rules, gone along 
with group-think behavior. 

School and college — these were 
the early norms, adhered to while 



78 



GALAXY 




she was still under the control of 
her parents. Basically those norms 
had remained unquestioned. 

Shalil noted in her mind an 
awareness that millions of people 
had somehow failed to achieve 
higher education. That was aston- 
ishing to him; yet somehow, these 
multitudes had been steered away 
from knowledge by a variety of 
accidental circumstances. 

So in those areas of personal 
development Edith had gone 
farther, better, straighter than a 
great many. Yet in college, first 
time away from her family, she had 
swiftly been caught up in a non- 
conformist group movement. 
Whatever the motives of the other 
persons involved, Edith’s had con- 
sisted solely of an intense inner 
need to beloog to the group. 

So, for her, it had been the be- 
ginning of aberration, which her 
behavior ever afterward reflected. 
Thus, Shalil observed, like a 
person struggling against invisible 
force lines, she had fought to re- 
turn to an inner norm. More study, 
different jobs, different places to 
live, association with different 
men — the confusion was immense, 
and it was difficult for Shalil to 
determine which of her numerous 
actions represented striving to- 
ward a real goal. 

Adding to the jumble: all her 
actions had been modified by a 
very large, though finite, number of 
small, endlessly repeated actions — 
eating habits, dressing habits, 



working, sleeping, walking, react- 
ing, communicating, thinking 
stereotypes. 

W HAT bothered Shalil was that 
he could not find a single point 
of entry into her mind that would 
not instantly trigger one of the 
stereotypes. The others had as- 
sumed that her conscious mind 
would present some opening; they 
had taken it for granted that he 
would locate it. His instructions 
were to uncreate her into uncon- 
sciousness if he failed to make 
such an entry, whereupon there 
would be another consultation. 

The possibility of such a quick 
failure disturbed Shalil. Tempori- 
zing, he said aloud, “This is the 
Garden of the Crystals in my cen- 
tury. Here, in the most virgin wil- 
derness left on our planet, the 
crystals lie buried in the soil, 
tended by guardian scientists.” 
Having spoken, having had that 
tiny bit of extra time to consider, 
he decided that the problem she 
presented might yield to a steady 
pressure of verbal maneuvering 
that would motivate her to express 
one after the other the endless 
stereotypes that had been detected 
in her — while he waited alertly for 
one he could shatter or through 
which the crystal — on his 

command — would divest her of the 
power with which it had, through 
some unknown factor, invested 
her. 

Her primary concern, he saw, 



THE REFLECTED MEN 



79 




was that she would never get back 
to her own era. Since he knew she 
could return at once simply by 
thinking the correct positive 
thought, his problem was to keep 
her worried, negative, unaware, 
deceived, misled. 

Shalil became aware that his 
anxiety about how to proceed was 
causing a hasty telepathic 
consultation among his col- 
leagues. Moments later the 
suggestion was made: Divert her by 
letting her win some minor 
victories and believe that they are 
gifts from you . 

The idea seemed good and Shalil 
carried it out as if it were a 
directive. 

IX 

A T THE Harkdale hotel another 
■ day dawned. Marge Aikens 
came downstairs, bleary-eyed 
from lack of sleep. She walked to 
the conference room, looked in. 
The lights had been turned off, the 
drapes were still drawn and the dim 
emptiness of the room weighted 
her spirits. 

She turned away and became 
aware of a man beside her. She 
faced him with a start. 

The hotel day clerk, Derek 
Slade, said courteously, “Mad- 
am — ” 

He continued to speak and after 
a while his meaning penetrated 
her dulled mind. He thought he had 
recognized her as the young 



woman who had late -the previous 
afternoon gone into the con- 
ference room with the five Seth 
Mitchells. Where — Derek wanted 
to know — were the four married 
Seths? The wives had been phoning 
all night, according to a note on 
his desk from the night clerk. And 
a police officer was on the way over 
because three Mrs. Mitchells had 
finally called the authorities. 

Marge had an impulse to deny 
that she was the woman he thought 
he had seen. But his failure to 
mention the bachelor Seth cap- 
tured her attention and she asked 
about him. 

Derek shook his head. “Not in 
his room. Went out early. I’m 
told.” 

Marge stood in the doorway, 
considering what might have 
happened to the best Seth. Why 
would he have gone out when he 
had said the previous that he would 
have breakfast with her? Then she 
became aware that Derek Slade’s 
gaze had gone past her shoulder 
and was seeking the darkened in- 
terior of the room behind her. 

His jaw grew lax, his eyes 
widened. 

In the room a man's baritone 
voice uttered an exclamation. 

Marge turned. 

The four Seths who had been un- 
created last night were standing 
near the door. Their backs were to 
her. 

She realized that it was one of 
the Seths who had exclaimed and 



80 



GALAXY 




that what he had said was, “Hey, 
who turned out the lights?” 

Marge had an immediate and 
totally perceptive awareness of 
the implications, of those words. 
Her mind leaped back to Billy 
Bingham’s not having had any 
transition impression at all of 
time having passed between his 
uncreation and recreation. 

This was the same. 

She reached into the room and 
pressed the light switch beside the 
door. As she did so a fifth Seth 
walked forward from one corner 
of the room, where he had sudden- 
ly appeared. He seemed be- 
wildered. From his clothing Marge 
tentatively identified him as the 
Seth of the gold Cadillac, some- 
how recreated without a bullet in 
his brain or a drop of lake water on 
his immaculate suit. 

But at the moment she had only 
a fleeting thought for him, for a 
sixth Seth was suddenly standing 
on the far side of the conference 
table. The way he held himself, his 
quick alertness as he looked 
around the room, saw the other 
Seths — and then flicked his gaze to 
her with relieved recognition . 

Seeing him, and receiving so 
many familiar signals that identi- 
fied Detective Seth Mitchell for 
her Marge became emotionally 
unglued. Without any of her 
usual discretion, she let out a 
scream. 

“Seth — my darling — ” 

Exactly how she got to him and 



he to her could undoubtedly be 
reasoned out from the fact that 
they met at the halfway point 
around the big table — and only 
desisted from their embrace when 
Marge grew aware that Edith Price 
was standing a few feet away, 
glancing timidly around her. 

Closely behind Edith appeared 
another Seth. He wore work 
clothes and Marge surmised that 
he therefore must be the farmer. 

Marge scarcely more than 
glanced at him. As she released 
herself from Detective Seth’s em- 
brace she saw that Edith wore a 
different dress and had her hair 
done differently — this was the 
Edith Price who had been 
murdered in New York by the 
worst Athtar. 

Of the Athtars there was no sign. 

And though the minutes fled 
by — and finally the bachelor Seth 
walked into the doorway — Edith 
Price, the crystal orientation, did 
not reappear. 

The best Seth explained that he 
had gone for a walk and, thinking 
over all that had happened, had 
decided that things would work 
out. 

He finished hopefully, “And 
here you all are. Each of you is 
living proof that Edith has found 
out what she can do. Or — ”he 
paused — “someone has, and is 
willing.” 

“But what can she do?” a Seth 
asked, bewildered. 

The best Seth smiled his friend- 



THE REFLECTED MEN 



81 




ly smile. “I’m rather fond of that 
young lady. In a way she’s a total 
reflection of our age, yet she 
thought her way to some kind of 
best.” He broke off, glanced from 
one to another of the numerous 
duplicate faces, and said softly, 
“You want to know what she can 
do? I didn’t dare speak of it at the 
time, but, now, well — if God is 
dead, what can replace Him?” 

“Then you are—” Marge put 
her hand over her mouth, ex- 
claimed through it, “Oh, my 
lord — Edith!” 

The best Seth said slowly, “I 
wonder what the crystal and Edith 
are doing with that concept.” 



S HALIL was in trouble. The 
giant had continued to wait 
for the purely personal, restrictive 
thought that, he and his colleagues 
believed, would presently end any 
control Edith had of the crystal’s 
future. 

But the moments had gone by 
and she had kept on uttering 
idealistic concepts that were bind- 
ing on him and his kind in relation 
to the people of the past. All the 
Seths and the Ediths were re- 
created. She proposed a coopera- 
tive solution for the severe threat 
to the giant human beings of 
his century — between the giants 
on the one hand and the Ediths and 
Seths on the other. In an outburst 
of imagination she visualized a 
time corridor between her own 



century and his. Thriftily she re- 
tained control of that corridor for 
her own group. 

It was as she established that 
enormous connection, and con- 
trol, that Shalil — desperate — had 
her uncreated. He recreated her, 
unconscious, on the contour rest- 
place. The huge scientists gathered 
around her comatose body and 
gloomily evaluated the extent of 
their defeat. 

One said, “But let’s face it. We 
can live with what’s happened.” 

The problem was that they had 
made no headway. Edith still 
radiated total power; somehow, 
she continued to evoke from the 
crystal an energy output that no 
one had ever thought possible. 

Shalil had a tremendous insight. 
“Perhaps that’s what we need to 
examine — our own limitations. 
Perhaps the real problem is that in 
our scientific zeal we have re- 
jected the enigma.” 

After he had spoken, there was a 
dead silence. He saw that they were 
shaken. The enigma was the 
forbidden — because unscientific — 
area of thought: The enigma that 
is the universe. Why does it exist? 
Where did it come from? 

The thrall of shocked silence 
ended as a giant gave a harsh, de- 
termined laugh. 

“I don’t know anything about 
the enigma and do not plan to,” he 
said, “but as a scientist I do know 
my duty — our duty. We must bring 
this small female to conscious- 



82 



GALAXY 




ness, inform her of the un- 
qualified extent of her power and 
see what she does with it.” 

“B-but she may kill us all,” pro- 
tested another. He added, almost 
plaintively, “I’ve never been 
killed.” 

“It will be an interesting ex- 
perience for you,” replied the first 
man. “Quite different from un- 
creation.” 

Shalil interjected matter-of- 
factly, “Edith is not a killer.” He 
broke off, shrewdly, “I think this is 
an excellent plan. I see it as being 
totally in our favor.” 

They perceived what he meant, 
and accordingly sanctioned the 
awakening. 

E DITH was brought awake. 

After she had calmed her- 
self — after she had been told about 
her absolute ability she had an 
automatic response, exactly as the 
giants had anticipated. For pro- 
longed seconds a wild hope 
suffused her entire being. She 
wanted more urgently to undo the 
errors of judgment which had led 
her down the empty road of 
numerous boy friends, none of 
whom took responsibility for her 
and her capacity to bear children. 
All her years of frustration since 
college found their way first to her 
eyes in the form of quick tears, and 
then, when she could speak, to her 
words. 

“Aside from what I’ve just told 



you — ” she spoke the qualifying 
phrase, which retained for her 
control of access to the twentieth 
century without even noticing 
it — “ all I really want is to be 
happily married.” 

The giants perceived that the 
person she had in mind for a 
husband was the bachelor Seth 
Mitchell. 

They accordingly commanded 
the crystal that the wish she had ex- 
pressed be carried out forthwith in 
its exact and limited meaning. 
And then, safe and relieved, they 
stood marveling at the difficult 
concept of marriage. 

In an era where everybody lived 
forever by a process of crystal 
duplication they would never, left 
to themselves, have been able to 
ask the right question to produce 
such an answer. 

“It is barely possible,” Shalil 
cautiously summed up, “that the 
interaction between the unmanipu- 
lated human beings of the twenti- 
eth century and the manipulated of 
the ninety-third will actually bring 
about a lessening of the rigidities 
of both groups.” 

His stern, black gaze dared a 
denial. After a long moment, he 
was surprised to realize that no 
one was offended. 

Indeed, a colleague murmured 
reflectively, “If that should 
happen we may even find out what 
the crystal is.” 

But, of course, that was 
impossible. 



THE REFLECTED MEN 



83 




The crystal was a space phenom- 
enon. The energy flows in it, 
around it and out of it involved in- 
dividual events, things, persons. 
But this was a subordinate 
function — like the motor center in 
a human brain that moves a muscle 
in the tip of the little finger. 

The muscle should be movable. 
It would be unfortunate if it were 
not. Yet if that muscle were per- 
manently incapacitated the fact 
would go unnoticed by the brain 
on the conscious level. 

On the flow level of existence the 
patterned interactions in and 
around and out of the crystal 
exceeded 10 to the 27000th power 
times the number of atoms in the 
universe — enough interactions 
for all the life configurations of 
all the people who ever lived; per- 
haps enough even for all those who 
ever would live on Earth. 

But for the crystal such effects 
were minor. As a governor of cer- 
tain time-and-life flows it had 
suspended those flows for twenty- 
five years in the Harkdale 
museum. The suspension did not 
matter — it meant almost nothing. 
As a shape of space, its existence 
was continuous. As space, it 
occupied a location and was 
related. Though it had no flows 
during the quarter century, made 
no recording and had no memory 
and no doing, it nevertheless 
knew, it was, it had and it could. 

In finding it and tens of 
thousands of crystals like it, human 



beings of the eighth and ninth 
millennia made use of the inter- 
actions and flows; never of the 
space ability. They discovered the 
principal “laws” — the how and the 
what — by which the crystals 
operated and were determined to 
find out eventually the rules that 
would “explain” certain unknowns 
in the wave behavior in and around 
and out of the crystals. 

Some day all the interactions of 
all life and all time would be evenly 
divided among the crystals. It 
would then become its true form; 
one crystal shape, one space. It 
would then be complete, its . in- 
tention . achieved. 

There was no hurry. 

And so it waited. And, waiting, 
fulfilled other goals than its own, 
minor, unimportant goals in- 
volving flows and interactions; re- 
flecting the illusions of motion: 
events, things, persons . involv- 
ing nothing, really. 

I N CONSEQUENCE, in Hark- 
dale today stands a one-story 
building of unusual design. The 
building occupies the exact spot 
where Billy Bingham once dis- 
appeared on the shore overlooking 
Lake Naragang. It is a solidly built 
structure and has a certain beauty. 

Its method of construction is 
shrouded in mystery. Natives grow 
vague when asked about it. 

On a gold plaque beside the or- 
nate front door are the words:

Resort visitors who stop to look

plural names. And long-time resi- 
dents, when asked, offer the im- 
pression that Crystal, Inc. actually 
deals in the numerous crystals to be

There is a large pretty house

the building. In this house dwell

adopting a thirteen-year-old boy 
whom they called Billy Bingham

SECOND 

RUN 

AT 

THE 

DATA 



DAUL PICTON, top hand in 
Chester City Security, saw the 
nimbus of amber light dead ahead 
on his flight lane and checked his 
time disk. Two minutes would take 
him to the entry port. Five min- 
utes to curfew. A neat use of avail- 
able time. 

He penciled a final note on the 
brief he had worked over during 
the trip and shoved it away in a 
monogramed document case. 

Submitted to the city fathers it 
should jerk the last waverers to a 
militant policy of clearance for the 
intercity areas. He would then 




have agreement from all five of 
the Wirral cities. That would 
strengthen his hand when Jervis re- 
tired in the fall. There would be no- 
body else with a record of pan city 
administration. Regional Direc- 
tor of Security was but a step 
away. 

That the peninsula would be free 
over its length and breadth for 
honest men to walk to and fro- al- 
ways supposing there were any 
about — would be a welcome by- 
product of his personal success. 

His attention was distracted 
from this wholesome program as 
the auto shuttle asked for 
clearance. The record clerk who 
had dictated its vocabulary bank 
had a clear, bell-like soprano which 
suddenly gave the shuttle a new 
dimension even on the formal ex- 
change. 

“Two-nine-six stroke A.C. 
Request entry lane." 



87 



“You have it. Reduce speed. 
Lane six, check booth F. You are 
welcome.” 

“Lane six, check booth F. Thank 
you.” 

Picton, in an unusually reflective 
mood, reckoned that mechanical 
courtesy swapping was a waste of 
power. Repeated over a decade it 
must represent a significant money 
loss. He might look into that. 
Show zeal as a public economist. 

He crossed the edge of the last of 
the reforestation zones fifty 
meters below, planted out in the 
last century as a counterweight to 
the thinning atmosphere in the 
intercity areas. From here on, 
industrial wasteland fled under 
him. Concrete rubble. Remains 
of old surface road systems. A 
maze of flyovers, underpasses 
and tumbled cloverleaf inter- 
sections. High time somebody 
cleared it up. There was shelter 
there, too near the city, for every 
kind of kook. 

A bright splash of silver gray be- 
tween two raised roadways had 
him craning around as his shuttle 
passed over. There was no doubt 
about it. An aircar had gone down 
there. Social worker, maybe, or 
medical unit. They were stupid to 
bother. The people who lived out 
there did so from choice. If they 
accepted the system and put in a 
day’s work they could be com- 
fortable inside. 

Something about the angle of 
the car, however, triggered 



another line of thought. Only a fool 
would have selected that landing 
point. More likely a forced land- 
ing. The plexiglas dome was all 
awry at that. 

Well, it would cost the pilot 
something to get a maintenance 
crew to turn out at this time of day, 
with the possibility of its being 
sniped at as dusk came on. More 
than likely he would settle for 
sweating it out until morning. 
He might lose some of his gear but 
the unscheduled citizens living 
outside rarely went in for personal 
violence in spite of reports. Just a 
hard night as a penalty for not 
having enough oil in his can. 

P ICTON was looking away when 
a flash of something green being 
waved registered on his peripheral 
vision. The wrecked car was out of 
sight — but he carried off an eidetic 
image which obligingly reformed 
on the polished curve of the 
shuttle’s console. The waver was 
female, nubile, red-headed, wear- 
ing a veridian tabard, torn dra- 
matically from the left shoulder to 
show a pale tumescence of white 
skin. She was arched back against 
the curvature of the wreck, one 
arm doing the signaling with a 
scarf or some such. 

His first reaction was irritation. 
He had been maneuvered into a 
corner where he had to ignore an 
appeal for help. Later, his shuttle 
might be identified. It would look 
bad on the record. 



88 



GALAXY 




Well, he would take that chance. 
Going down there now would leave 
him no time to get in before cur- 
few. That would mean a night at 
the Gatehouse. Bad for his image. 

The shuttle was picking up 
speed again, ready for a clear run 
down Lane Six, when Picton 
caught sight of himself on the 
same piece of polished bulkhead. 

Most times the reflection gave 
him uncomplicated pleasure— a 
long smooth egg head with dark 
brown hair slicked back; large, in- 
telligent eyes; thin, well-con- 
toured mouth. Currently an un- 
smoothed relic of the race’s senti- 
mental past had seen fit to shove a 
hairy finger out of the uncon- 
scious dungheap and write RAT, 
in Palace Script, upper case, across 
his bland forehead. 

He fought it for thirty seconds 
and the shuttle was adjusting to 
the carrier beam which would see 
it home to its pad when he finally 
moved, a defeated logician. Slip- 
ping into the pilot seat, he broke 
the auto chain and look the con- 
sole on manual. 

The distant traffic controller, 
startled out of courtesy, said, 
“Two-nine-six stroke A. C. Stay in 
lane.” 

Picton crossed three empty out- 
going lanes in an illegal U-turn 
and headed back. At the same time 
he selected a security channel and 
alerted his own office. 

“Controller Picton. I am investi- 
gating a grounded shuttle two kilo- 



meters out on the Wirral Trunk. 
Book me in at the Gatehouse in 
case I need a room.” 

An android counter clerk gave a 
timed receipt for- the record and 
Picton switched off. 

It was some years since he had 
flown a shuttle and he found he was 
enjoying it. He dropped ten 
meters below the lowest flight lane 
and watched the broken ground 
through the observation panel at 
his feet. 

Close down, the terrain was less 
easy to identify. All the dilapi- 
dated areas looked alike. Could be 
he would not find the wreck again 
and his selfless efforts would be all 
loss. 

But Picton had not crawled to 
the heights of his profession for 
nothing. He bent his brain to it 
and came up with a zig-zag plan of 
search over the half kilometer 
where the wreck must lie. 

Two freight cars passed 
overhead in a howl of effort to 
reach port before curfew. Then, 
like the ploughman, he had the 
dusk to himself. 

He came on the wreck 
unexpectedly and so close that all 
the detail was clear. He was ap- 
proaching it from the far side and 
the figure was hidden except for 
the arm still waving its green scarf. 

Something was wrong about 
that. What was she waving at? 
There was nothing about except 
his own car and any fool could see 
that he was landing.

He dropped down neatly on the 
skids and shoved back the hatch. 
Then he was outside, drawing deep 
breaths and moving slowly like the 
manuals said to counteract the 
oxygen-thin air. 

Rounding the blunt bows of the 
grounded craft, he panted out: 
“Stop that. Come with me. I’ll 
take you to the Gatehouse.” 

Then he stopped. His foundling 
was an android, a collector’s piece 
with a torso modeled from a clas- 
sical original, but with large, 
balancing feet of aluminum. 

Even in rarefied air Picton’s 
brain was no slouch in handling in- 
formation. It hit its ceiling of a 
thousand million units a second 
and punched out a definitive 
warning: Out Paul, your gallantry 
has been abused . 

Other signals crowded his 
sensors. A whir came from his own 
shuttle. As he whipped around 
it began to lift. By the time he had 
taken two imprudently fast steps 
it was up ten meters. 

Panting hard, his heart begin- 
ning to race, he stood still and 
watched it go. 

P ICTON was all of one minute 
with open mouth and his mind 
on a loop saying that they couldn’t 
do that to him. Then he closed 
mind and mouth and looked 
around the darkening set. 

At ground level there was not 
much to see. The sky glow thrown 
up by the city was diffuse and dis- 



tant. Working his way over the 
rubble in the dark it would take 
him hours to cover a kilometer. 

He moved slowly to the wrecked 
car and said irritably, “You can 
stop that. No other sucker is likely 
to go by.” 

The android stopped and turned 
its head to the voice. Momen- 
tarily, he believed he had been 
wrong. Wide-open blue eyes in a 
regular oval face focused intel- 
ligently on his own. She was cer- 
tainly a high-grade job. One of 
those proscribed in the cities more 
than a century back for being too 
near the human pattern and apt to 
lead the frail human psyche into 
perversion. 

Having registered that the 
arrival was male, tall and knocking 
forty, this one went off in a sultry 
drawl like a saloon hostess. “Wel- 
come, handsome stranger. Follow 
me and I’ll show you where the 
action is.” 

Picton ignored the invitation and 
climbed into the shell of the wreck. 
What he saw was no help. All 
usable gear had long been stripped 
out. The effort of climbing aboard 
had made him sweat as if he had 
been hauling himself around on 
an Andean peak. One way or 
another he had to get himself to 
the atmosphere-controlled Gate- 
house. 

But transport was essential. 

The android had walked around 
to the hatch and was peering in like 
a disembodied head. She was the 



90 



GALAXY 




only mechanized artifact on the 
set. Maybe he could have her tow 
him along. Or carry him, even? 

He said sharply. “Put your 
hands on your hips and turn 
around. Stand still.” 

Careful to preserve his balance, 
Picton, light-headed now as if in a 
dream sequence, angled himself 
onto her shoulders. 

When he was set, he said, 
“Okay. Walk round the shuttle." 

Obliging, if nothing else, and 
seemingly without any speech re- 
sponse for this contingency, she 
picked her way, sure-footed in the 
rubble, on a complete circuit. The 
ride was not uncomfortable. 
Picton reckoned he could hold the 
seat for as long as it would take. 
There was even an agreeable scent 
of verbena wafting up from long- 
acting perfume ducts behind her 
plastic ears. 

They left the grove at a steady 
pace with trooper Picton tall in the 
saddle and peering forward into 
the gathering dusk. Without 
having to make physical effort and 
discovering the knack of deep 
regular breathing, Picton grew ad- 
justed enough to his environment 
to begin to work out the angles. 

His patient zombie was a 
valuable piece of equipment. Who- 
ever had fixed the decoy would 
want it back. To take her away had 
proved too easy to be allowed. 

He had hardly formulated this 
estimate of the situation when he 
became aware that he and the 



android were moving out of line. 
Underfoot he saw smooth ashlar, 
unusually free from rubble and 
his pearl white mare, reacting to 
the good road, had stepped up her 
rhythm. 

She rounded a corner into a 
gully, the floor sloping down in a 
broad vamp. 

He said, “Hold it there. Wait — ” 
and struggled to get free. But she 
had his legs in a viselike grip and 
took no notice. 

Darkness gathered around his 
head. He felt the sway of a sharp 
left turn and put his hands out to 
fend off a wall but found only open 
space. Another sharp turn and 
there was enough light for him to 
see a roof overhead. He could even 
touch it and run his hands along it 
for something to grip. But it was 
glass smooth. 

Then she was walking directly 
toward a ridged, silver gray 
barrier with diffused light behind 
it and his probing hands were 
pushing away multiple strands of 
thick plastic rope. There was al- 
most half a meter of it — enough to 
engulf him in a curious yellow 
limbo before he found himself in 
an open space, brilliantly lit. 

A man’s voice said, “What’s 
this, then? The Old Man of the 
Sea?” 

H IS first bonus was a standard 
atmosphere and Paul Picton 
took long quivering breaths of it. 
His head cleared. He was in a large 



SECOND RUN ATTHE DATA 



91 




community room and he reck- 
oned he had made a poor entrance 
for a V. I. P. 

Thirty or more people were 
deployed about the set, a mixed age 
group. The youngest were playing 
some kind of building game with 
large, numbered cubes, watched by 
a dark girl with a thick ringlet like 
a blue-black, lustrous rope for- 
ward of the left shoulder. 

A small group was watching the 
early evening newscast. Two 
women of indeterminate age 
with head bands and buck teeth 
were playing three-dimensional 
chess. Far left, a round-faced 
young man astride an artist’s 
donkey was knocking off a canvas 
from a life model and the girl 
tapping her foot on the plinth, ex- 
cept for the detail of aluminum 
feet, could have been twin sister to 
Picton’s mount. 

The scene was an updated 
version of a Dyak long house in full 
social spate and the over- 
whelming impression was of re- 
laxed enjoyment. 

Every eye had tracked him in. 
The bearded father figure who had 
spoken first went into trans- 
mission again. 

“Put the Controller down, 
Amanda. You have done very 
well.” 

So they knew who Paul Picton 
was. It had all been arranged. One 
way or another, they would have 
brought him to this place. He had 
simply made it easy for them. Well, 



they would not be so complacent 
when his clearance drive got under 
way. He smoothed down his metal 
cloth tunic and recaptured what 
cool he could. 

“What do you hope to gain by 
this?” 

“Gain? There is nothing to gain. 
Except perhaps for yourself. We 
wanted to have a look at you. The 
fact that you responded to 
Amanda’s signal is encouraging. 
For a start, it suggests that you are 
not pig iron all through or you 
would have ignored her.” 

“And if I had done so?” 

“You are a regular commuter 
through here at this time. Some 
other way would have been found.” 
Feet on a steady floor, good air 
to breathe, Picton was feeling more 
himself. Although, overall, the 
situation was bizarre, these were 
rational people. Diplomatic 
usage could be followed. 

Picton said, and even managed a 
false smile, “Guide me to the Gate- 
house and I will overlook the 
action so far. Though I can’t speak 
for the shuttle company. They 
may have their own views about the 
loss of their property. But I’m 
willing to forget this if we go 
now.” 

“Not so fast. Put our actions 
down to our concern for your 
good. Let me introduce myself. I 
am Michael Gerrard.” 

Picton ignored the hand that was 
being held out. “My well-being will 
be best served by your letting me

GALAXY 




complete my journey. Yours also 
is now bound up with it. At day- 
break there will be a search.” 

“Not so. You still do not 
appreciate the position you are in'. 
Alex, let him hear the last signal 
from his shuttle.” 

A plump, middle-aged man with 
a receding hair line and a fixed 
grin pulled a palm-sized recorder 
from the pocket of his coveralls 
and thumbed down a switch. 
Picton heard his own voice say: “I 
have picked up the occupant of 
the stranded shuttle. Cancel my 
reservation at the Gatehouse. I 
am leaving the region and will be 
away for some days. Immediate 
destination Blundell City.” 

Gerrard said, “That gives us 
some time. Time for much vision 
and revision. Roy, Carlos, take 
the Controller into the theater. 
Hook him up to the screen. 

Belatedly Picton tried to run for 
the rope wall. Hands grabbed him. 
He was carried backward, 
kicking, his feet off the floor, 
across the width of the room and 
through an open arch into semi- 
darkness. He felt a sharp stab high 
in his left shoulder and, although 
his mind went crystal clear, the 
steam went out of him. 

Unable to move, he saw and felt 
them strap him to a highbacked 
chair with a head stall. He felt a 
cold circlet of light alloy drop 
around his forehead, and hands he 
could not see made adjustments 
that set uncountable small pres- 



sure points all over his skull. 

At his back came the sound of 
feet as an audience filed in and 
settled down to watch. Before him 
an oval screen glowed a pale trans- 
lucent green like an immense 
cathode eye. 

Gerrard’s voice, to Picton’s left 
and to the rear, had taken on a soft, 
hypnotic tone that seemed to infil- 
trate into the very fabric of his 
head. “Relax Controller. Just 
relax. I want to take you back to 
your first memories. You are a 
small boy. You remember what it 
was like to be a very small boy.” 

P ICTON tried to resist. It was an 
invasion of privacy. The screen 
deepened to cherry red. He said, 
“No — ” over and over and it ap- 
peared on the screen as a running 
border. No. No. No. No. 

But he could feel the relaxing 
tide washing in. His resistance 
crumbled like a sand castle and dis- 
appeared. The line of negatives on 
the screen shrank small into a se- 
quence of black dots. The screen it- 
self became a creamy mist that 
cleared suddenly to a black and 
white picture of brilliant defini- 
tion. He was looking at a short run 
of clinically bare wall with an open 
gap into a white tiled corridor. 

It was something he could have 
sworn had been lost in the mental 
scree. Sifted out. But the scene was 
true enough. He must have been 
five or six years old at that time. 
He was looking from his trundle

bed to the open end of his cubicle 
in the Initial Teaching Establish- 
ment, where he had gone from the 
Nursery Unit in Eastham City. 

Emotion came fully articulated 
with the picture. He was crying 
silently, so that no sound could be 
picked up on the monitor, tears 
running in a steady stream down 
his face. Stage one in the con- 
ditioning of a public servant had 
begun. He was on his own, with- 
out parent or friend or any per- 
sonal artifact to call his own. Just 
an embryo personality in a sterile 
casket. 

He was crying because some dis- 
sembler had whipped his woolly 
dog on a hygiene kick. It was a 
small issue, but an illustration 
that pain is only real if you feel it 
and he was feeling it. 

The screen blanked, glowed 
ruminatively for a count of five and 
unfolded again on a new pitch. 

Focus was sharper. He was 
standing in front of a console and 
he was terrified. Hands behind his 
back, he had the fingers in a cat’s 
cradle twist in a bid to control a 
muscular tremor which was rip- 
pling about on his upper arms and 
behind his knees. 

Over the broad desk top, the 
principal of the I. T. E., a smooth- 
faced pedagogue with cold blue 
eyes, had his fingertips in a judi- 
cious docking ploy and was staring 
over them like a stone image. They 
hid his mouth so that his voice 
sounded like a ventriloquist’s. 



“Your explanation is not 
satisfactory, Picton. Wrong re- 
sponses over two hundred items 
were exactly the same as Kopec’s. 
There is no doubt you were copying 
his work. It is not intelligent to 
deny it. You disappoint me, 
Picton.” 

Picton, reliving the scene at full 
emotional strength, writhed in the 
hot seat. Simple fear, basic indig- 
nation at the injustice of it, shame 
at the ongoing action, which he re- 
membered now in detail, all com- 
bined to bead his forehead with 
sweat. 

He heard the boy, that familiar 
stranger, say haltingly, “It was 
Kopec. Kopec asked me for the an- 
swers and I told him what I had. It 
wasn’t me, Mr. Onon, it was 
Kopec.” 

He saw Smiler Kopec, his great 
friend, as an inset at the top right 
on the screen. His only prop and 
stay in that draughty caravan- 
serai. Betrayed. For what? 

“Then it was your duty to say so. 
Which you have now done. Very 
good, Picton. There is hope for 
you. You were wrong, however, to 
answer his questions. For that you 
must be punished. You must see 
that your action would falsify the 
records.” 

What was the punishment? 
Nothing he could remember. Only 
the look in Kopec’s eye when he 
passed him in the corridor and the 
empty place next to his own in the 
refectory.

That was not shown on the 
screen. Gerrard edited it out and 
passed on, skipping a decade and 
putting the finger on the subject 
in his freshman year at the Barn- 
ston Polytech — that illustrious 
Alma Mater for all there was of 
genius in the North West Province. 

He was in a small common 
room, close-packed with male and 
female intelligentsia sitting on 
the floor, perched on chair backs, 
shoulder-to-shoulder around the 
walls. One and all listening like 
beavers to a spectacular redhead 
in a tight, ljpie-green sweater. 

She had the freedom of a small 
clearing in the middle of the press. 
As she turned animatedly this way 
and that to make contact with all 
the group her hair swung elas- 
tically with subtle shifts of color. 
Neat, capable hands made precise 
gestures to emphasize a point. 
She was a honey. Rita Danvers, 
elected head of the student body 
for the semester. Currently drum- 
ming support for a demo against 
the clampdown on a popular 
course in social history. 

He was in this private meeting, 
though a freshman, on her per- 
sonal invitation. He had dated her 
twice and the signs were all affirm- 
ative. 

Seated in the front row, Picton 
was well placed to admire her long 
athletic legs and get the message 
strength nine. Against his chest, in 
his breast pocket, he could feel the 
vibration of the miniature re- 



corder which was taking a trans- 
script. 

There was some conflict in his 
mind. What she was saying had the 
ring of truth. But he told himself it 
was emotional truth, not intel- 
lectual truth. Logic and reason 
should dictate the program. The 
authorities, with all the data to 
work on, must have the belter case. 

At the end, amid applause, she 
went into a full knee bend beside 
him and put an impulsive hand on 
his shoulder. Eyes shining. A 
stimulated demagogue. He was 
afraid that the electric warmth of 
her touch might send up a crackle 
of static. 

But he had it all buttoned up. 
Chapter and verse for the action. 
Names named. Tasks allocated. 
It was a full hour before he could 
get away to his own room — then he 
was sitting at his study carrel 
calling through to the senior ad- 
ministrator on a private link and 
plugging in the small capsule that 
told all. 

He watched them take her away. 
Four riot cars dropped out of a 
clear sky into the main square. 
Security men turned out at a run, 
carbines held chest high. Nine- 
teen militants were taken. She 
came out between two guards, 
head back, hair catching the sun in 
a bright aureole. 

That was the last he saw of her, 
or heard. One discreet inquiry he 
had made but the writing on the 
wall was plain to read.

Not your business, Picton. Do 
your job. Don't ask questions. 
You will be looked after . 

He was looked after. Without 
being particularly popular or 
specially gifted for the chore he had 
fetched up in the top student slot 
as president. 

Without beating his brain to a 
froth he clocked the best grades in 
his year. Security, with a private 
line to the back of every examining 
computer was the horseshoe in 
his glove. 

That was the beginning. There 
was much more, a rodent's 
progress through the social maze, 
becoming ever more adept at 
nosing out the right information 
at the right time. Finally taking a 
hand in his own rise and progress 
to the top echelon of the security 
machine itself. 

Picton could sense that the 
crowd at his back was hostile. Re- 
laxing drugs still pussy-footing 
around the synapses prevented any 
strong reaction. But he was sud- 
denly anxious that they should see 
his point of view. There was 
another side to the record. 
Authority was important. The end 
justified the means. Stability and 
order were the ultimate good. 
Freedom was only possible under 
strong guarantee. He was, all in 
all, a pillar of the social fabric. 

He only realized that he had 
been talking aloud when an an- 
swer came from the group. 

A girl’s voice said, “The ancient 



lie. Ends and means are comple- 
mentary. No good end ever came 
from treachery and broken faith. 
You are a monster.” 

Gerrard said, “Don’t forget, he 
was conditioned to it over a long 
period. A man’s past and present 
do not necessarily dictate the 
pattern of his future. If they did, 
this examination would not be 
worth conducting.” 

P AUL PICTON was fighting for 
breath. His free-wheeling mind 
had sold him the illusion that a 
bearded tormentor was building a 
mound of lead granules, handful 
by handful, on his chest. He 
opened his eyes. 

There was nothing much to see. 
It was cold. He was lying without 
cover on a ridged stone floor open 
to the sky. A dawn wind sliding 
uneasily through the asphalt 
jungle poked small cold fingers 
down his tunic collar and up the 
legs of his pants. 

He was stopped dead in his cata- 
logue of discomfort by the sky. He 
might never have seen it before. In 
some sense that was true. What 
was to be seen through the plexi- 
glas baffles over city streets or 
from the seat of a hurrying shuttle 
was nothing like the naked con- 
tact. 

Distance to dwarf him to a sand 
grain, A star map that put the

into perspective as a transient 
fiction. Color that ranged from the

GALAXY 




most intense black to a startling 
heliotrope in an irregular, widen- 
ing band over the horizon. 

Picton rolled over and heaved 
himself slowly to hands and knees, 
a panting dog ready to bay the 
moon. He could not take his eyes 
off the sky and could not believe 
that it had been there all the time. 
For his money it could have been 
created freshly to confuse him. 

He was well placed to see it. All 
around him the ground fell away. 
He was on the high point of a 
humpback flyover. The city was 
plain to see, not half a kilometer 
distant. His time disk told him it 
was 0600. Only thirty minutes and 
he could go straight in. 

There was a central island with 
the stump of a rusty bollard. He 
crawled to it and pulled himself to 
his feet, shivering as if with an 
ague. His mind knew one over- 
riding imperative-*-to get inside 
and make for his pad. 

Light strengthened all the time, 
bringing up the way ahead as a 
composition in shades of gray. 
He forced himself to move at a 
slow, deliberate walk, mouth 
hanging wide open to pack in more 
air. 

He paused a hundred meters 
from the city gate, self-hypnotized 
by the rhythm of his unaccus- 
tomed exercise. The sky beyond 
the city had flushed rose madder 
and had stopped him in his tracks. 

For a count of ten he looked at it 
stupidly. The long shadow of the 



city wall came out to within a 
meter of his feet. Two more paces 
and he would be engulfed by it. 

Short on oxygen intake, his mind 
gagged and slipped off load, 
leaving him without benefit of 
guidance. 

Somewhere in the unconscious 
brain tub where every man is his 
own stranger, a life prisoner 
snapped its corroded chains and 
pole-vaulted into the vacant slot 
from which prudent government 
had stepped down. 

Picton turned his back on the 
city and looked the way he had 
come. The wasteland was bathed 
in a red flood as though a cosmic 
hand had brought up a dimmer. 
With the force of revelation, he 
knew for a truth that his future lay 
there and not in the city. There was 
a chance for him to start over. 

Maybe he wouldn’t make it. His 
heart was already under strain. 
Maybe he wouldn’t be able to find 
them again. But he had to try. On 
his own this time. It was the con- 
frontation he had ducked all his 
life and would not duck again. 

Decision brought a small bonus 
of libido. He stretched to full 
height and led off smartly with the 
left foot. He would go on until he 
could not put one foot in front of 
the other and then he would crawl. 

Perhaps, with all their 
knowledge, they would know what 
he was doing. Either way, it did 
not matter. At this point in time he 
was doing what he had to do. ★

THE SHARKS 
OF PENTREATH 



MICHAEL G. CONEY 




D URING the night there was a 
thunderstorm and I lay awake 
for some time as the scarlet cur- 
tains flared again and again to the 
incessant lightning. I got out of bed 
once and looked out across the 
harbor to the open sea flashing 
silver between the jagged black 
teeth of the twin headlands. I saw 
the boats heaving restlessly at 
anchor as the long waves rolled in 
and smashed against the stone 
quay, throwing high plumes of 



spray across the narrow water- 
front street. I worried about the ' 
boats because two of them were as- 
signed to me for my current Full- 
time; I had rented them with good 
money. 

Then I thought about Gordon > 
Ewell’s jerry-built Grotto down the 
road, and I felt better^He had not | 
allowed for this sort of weather in 
May. 

I went back to bed. As I 
shrugged my head deeper into the | 
pillow I saw Sylvia’s eyes flicker 
open in alarm when another crack '

of thunder shook the village. 
Thunder frightened her; I knew 
she was thinking of suggesting 
she get into my bed. So 1 turned 
the other way and went to sleep. 

By breakfast time the storm had 
passed over and a watery sun 
glinted from the puddles and sea 
with unnatural brilliance. We con- 
cluded our usual silent meal and I 
left Sylvia to wash up the things 
while I took a stroll down the 
street. Pentreath looked good that 
May morning and I hoped the 
weather would stay fine for the 



opening of the official tourist sea- 
son. The facades of the buildings, 
freshly painted and gleaming with 
rain, looked much as they must 
have in the twentieth century and 
earlier; a rambling row of dis- 
similar stone and brick struc- 
tures, some overhanging the 
street, some with jutting bow win- 
dows packed with curios, all re- 
stored with painstaking detail 
garnered from old photographs 
and picture postcards. Come to 
quaint Pentreath, the resort with 
character.

Nearly all totally fake, of 
course — the stone and brick most- 
ly recreated from modern materi- 
als — the facades are just that; be- 
hind the solid-looking fronts are 
prefabricated rooms decked out 
with imitation oak and plaster, 
extraordinarily convincing. But my 
place is real — The Treasure Trove 
Gifte Shoppe and Tea Rooms is 
the identical building which has 
stood for centuries on Pentreath 
quay, a genuine ancient monu- 
ment. 

I had rented the Treasure Trove 
in the earlier days; in successive 
Fulltime years I had come here 
and Sylvia and I had worked 
damned hard. After four years of 
this, punctuated by eight years of 
careful Shelflife, I had bought the 
place. Now we should be set for 
life. During our periods of Shelf- 
life I let the place out; on the in- 
come we are able to send our re- 
motors almost anywhere we please 
to enliven the enforced idleness. 
But we seldom go together. In De- 
cember of last year I had my re- 
motor adapted for skiing and en- 
joyed the winter sports at St. 
Moritz while I lay in comfort at 
the Shelflife Center, secure in 
my steel cabinet. Sylvia, how- 
ever, monitored the Christmas 
festivities at the Center; her re- 
motor never stirred out of the 
building but sat chattering to the 
other machines belonging to 
those people on Rotomation One 
too impoverished to remo- 



travel. I can never understand 
why Sylvia likes people so much. 

I crossed the street to the quay- 
side and checked the rope that se- 
cured my dinghy. A glance across 
the harbor satisfied me that Daf- 
fodil and Skylark still rode 
smoothly at anchor — their chains 
had held fast during the night. I 
didn’t expect any boat customers 
today but in a week or two, when 
the season warmed up, the craft 
would be in use continuously, 
trotting remotors around the bay 
on fishing trips. 

Turning, I walked over to 
Ewell’s Grotto. Ewell himself was 
busy with a broom, ineffectively 
sweeping water out of the en- 
trance in muddy waves, 

“Much damage last night?” I en- 
quired. 

He looked up. His young, weak 
face was flushed with effort. 

“Could be worse, Mr. Green,” 
he replied. “One or two rips in the 
canvas, that’s all.” He hesitated. 
“I wonder- could Mrs. Green 
lend me a hand and stitch things up 
a bit?” 

I didn’t reply but strolled inside 
to inspect the damage. Fiberglass 
stalagmites lay around in confu- 
sion and the canvas hung awry. A 
gaping hole in one wall had al- 
lowed leaves and twigs to blow in 
and the fairy pool was full of muck. 
The place was a mess. 

Ewell’s Grotto is a temporary 
structure; he dismantles it at the 
end of each Fulltime year and 



100 



GALAXY 




packs it away while he takes his 
two years Shelflife. Consequent- 
ly he doesn’t pay local siterates. 
I find this sort of situation annoy- 
ing; people of Ewell’s type are 
parasites feeding off gullible re- 
motourists while the rest of us 
foot the bill. My own siterates are 
heavy. 

“Oh, dear. What a shame.” I 
swung around on hearing Sylvia’s 
voice. She was standing at the en- 
trance, regarding the devasta- 
tion with dismay. Ewell hovered 
at her side, eager for sympathy. 
“Look, Gordon,” she continued, 
“I’ll slip home and fetch the sail- 
making things and get the canvas 
sewn up while John helps you clear 
up the mess. I won’t be a minute.” 

She departed, leaving me in 
helpless irritation. It wasn’t the 
first time she had volunteered my 
services to help a competitor. 
Ewell was grinning at me grate- 
fully — being unmarried, he is 
insensitive to nuances of be- 
havior between married couples. 

“Thanks a lot, Mr. Green,” he 
said as we started to tidy the place 
up. 

I T TOOK about an hour to get 
the Grotto presentable and set up 
Ewell’s ridiculous little gift shop, a 
rough imitation rock counter at 
the back of the tent complex which 
Sylvia and he loaded carefully 
with worthless trinkets and post- 
cards. I left Sylvia to help with the 



finishing touches and went out to 
see to the Herefords. 

The Herefords are another of 
those touches of authenticity of 
which I am rather proud. The herd 
numbers twenty white-faced brown 
brutes of no practical purpose 
save to stand around the large field 
at the back of the waterfront street 
and look picturesquely rustic. 
Sylvia once tried making genu- 
ine Cornish Beef Pies for the Tea 
Room but the experiment was a 
failure. The few Fulltime tourists 
we get, together with the locals, 
found the variable consistency 
of real meat repulsive and quick- 
ly reverted to synthetics. The re- 
motors, which constitute the vast 
majority of tourists, do not eat 
and seemed reluctant to burden 
themselves with perishable pies 
to take back to the Shelflife Cen- 
ters. 

On the strength of the Here- 
fords, however, they do buy our 
Olde Englishe Clotted Cream 
which, laughably, is synthetic. 

In the bright sun this morning 
the Herefords looked wonderful, 
posing in powerful attitudes 
against the background of grass, 
hillside and puffclouded sky — like 
a nineteenth-century oil painting. 
One of the animals, a large cow 
under a tall cedar, was bellowing 
realistically. For a moment I toy- 
ed with the idea of herding them 
down outside the back windows of 
the Tea Room but decided to leave 
that until later. In their present 



THE SHARKS OF PENTREATH 



101 




position they could be seen from 
the coach park at the top of the 
village. 

1 unlocked my small shed and 
took out the signs. Labeling the 
cattle is a long job but worthwhile 
from an advertising point of 
view. The signs are large and heavy 
and I can only carry two at a time, 
so it was an hour before I had fin- 
ished; but by ten o’clock each cow 
carried, slung across its broad 
back and hanging down either 
flank, twin boards reading: THE 
SHELFLIFE OF GREEN’S 
CREAM IS AS LONG AS YOUR 
OWN. 

I surveyed the field and was sat- 
isfied. In the distance, over the 
crest of the hill, the sun reflected 
from the roofs of the approaching 
coaches. 

B Y THE time I reached the 
coach park the vehicles were 
arriving, groaning and spewing 
archaic diesel smoke. There were 
two, each about eight feet wide and 
thirty long with deep, unneces- 
sary windows running the length 
of the sides. Painted scarlet, they 
bore the words MIDLAND RED 
along their sides. In front, just be- 
low the roof line, were placards 
reading ROTOMATION 2 and 
ROTOMATION 3. 

They pulled into the park and 
halted side by side. The din of in- 
ternal combustion ceased. The 
drivers jumped out, carrying 
lists, held a leisurely conversa- 



tion, then strolled to the rear of the 
vehicles. I followed. I like to 
know the worst, right away. 

I needn’t have worried. The 
coaches were packed with remo- 
tourists. The driver of Rotomation 
2 jerked open the twin doors and 
began to hand down the metallic 
boxes to his companion, who laid 
them carefully on the ground. I 
positioned myself above the first 
box, a cube with dimensions 
something under two feet, and 
waited while it shifted, lifted itself 
three feet from the ground on 
telescopic legs, then extended a 
slender, gleaming neck from the 
center of the cube. At the top of the 
neck was the head, cylindrical and 
about six inches in diameter, about 
level with my own. 

The robot spoke, “Good morn- 
ing,” it said politely. 

“Are you in charge of Roto- 
mation 2?” I asked. 

“That’s right. Name’s Tom 
Lynch. Gloucester Shelflife Cen- 
ter.” 

“John Green,” I said, grasping 
the stubby hand projecting from 
the side of the cube, “of the 
Treasure Trove Gifte Shoppe and 
Tea Rooms.” I produced my 
handout. “Here you are. You'll 
find us about halfway along the 
waterfront. I’ll make it worth your 
while.” 

“Ah, Mr. Green.” If it were 
possible for a remotor to stiffen. 
Lynch would have stiffened. “This 
tour is in no way regimented. I

don’t shepherd these people 
around. The idea is, they do what 
they want for the day.” 

I meet this type sometimes. “I’m 
aware of that.” I tried to match his 
air of dignity. “But you’re in a po- 
sition to make suggestions. 
That’s all I meant.” 

“Yes,” replied the remotor am- 
biguously, turning away and al- 
lowing my handout to flutter to the 
ground. “On your feet, folks!” His 
voice became jovial as he ad- 
dressed the gangling forms lurch- 
ing around, getting used to their 
legs. “We’ve only got a day here. 
Get set to enjoy yourselves! Hur- 
ry! Hurry — ” 

Within a short while both 
coaches were unloaded. 

“That’s progress for you.” The 
driver of Rotomation 2 spoke; he 
leaned against the side of his coach, 
smoking. “This used to be a forty- 
seater. Now it holds three hundred. 
Pack ’em in-»*’ He chuckled 
cynically. 

“That’s the story of Rotoma- 
tion,” I agreed. “Why do you use 
these old vehicles?” 

“Adds color to the deal. My 
company, we've got fifty of these. 
U:“d to take Fulltime tourists 
about but it didn’t pay, not at forty 
to a coach. Even though the 
coaches are authentic and we 
charged accordingly. So we 
switched to remotors and adver- 
tised at the Shelflife Centers. 
Genuine lours just like grandpa 
used to take. Those your cows?” 



“Yes.” 

“Nice touch. One thing I miss, 
though. I’m sixty, been driving all 
my life. Time was, years ago, I 
drove real tourists around, before 
Rotomation. Used to get girls, 
unaccompanied like.” He 
sniggered. “Nowadays, how do I 
know what they look like, one 
remotor is just like the next? You 
can’t even tell the age, not unless 
you ask a remotor straight out. 
Look a bit silly when you find 
you’re chatting up an old dear of 
seventy.” He sighed. “Anyway, 
I’m getting a bit old for that 
game.” 

He looked it. Thin gray hair 
straggled across the parchment 
skin of his lined brow. Suddenly I 
tired of his reminiscences. The 
remotourists were pouring down 
the village in a silver tide and I had 
work to do. 1 walked away, leaving 
him staring ruminatively at his 
moist cigarette. 

T HE coach park belongs to a 
friend of mine by the name of 
Charles Judd. He charges by the 
head and makes a good living from 
this and his remotor repair shop. 
He picked up the coach park 
cheap, too, from an old fellow dis- 
heartened by the fall in land values 
following Rotomation. 

In order that the appearance of 
Pentreath remain unspoiled the 
local council insists on Charles’ site 
at the clifftop being the only 
coach park near the village. Well 



THE SHARKS OF PENTREATH 



103 




away from the cluster of build- 
ings at the waterfront, the park 
has a rough path leading down to 
the main street. The view is superb 
and gives a good initial impres- 
sion to the remotourist. 

Charles has an interesting side- 
line; he has affixed at the seaward 
side of the park a notice which 
states that persons descending to 
the beach by the cliff path do so at 
their own risk. The cliff path, as 
distinct from the proper path to 
the village, is barely negotiable. 

The remotourist is naturally ad- 
venturous. He has little to lose; 
should his remotor be damaged in 
some stupid escapade he merely 
pays to have it repaired, while 
himself lying in comfort at the 
Shelflife Center, experiencing 
exciting events through his im- 
periled robot’s senses. I do quite 
well in heavy seas that way; the 
boats are comprehensively insured. 

As a result many remotourists, 
rather than take the safe road to 
the village, will see Charles’ sign 
and attempt the cliff path. A Full- 
time human can manage it if he 
has a strong head for heights, but 
remotors are not so agile. 

And sure enough, as 1 passed the 
sign grinning to myself as always 
at the shrewdness of Charles’ idea, 
I heard cries for help. 

I hurried to the repair shop, a 
wooden shack at the village end 
of the park, and banged on the 
door. Charles appeared with a 
telescopic leg in his hand. 



“You’ve got customers on the 
cliff path,” I informed him. 

His expression brightened. 
“Thanks,” he said. He fetched a 
rope from inside the shack and 
hurried to the cliff-top. I tagged 
along to watch the fun. 

“Hang on to this, will you, 
John?” He tied the rope about his 
waist and handed me the end. 
“Take a turn around that post. 
Not that 1 expect to fall; I could 
climb this cliff blindfold.” He 
chuckled and scrambled over the 
edge. 1 paid the rope out, keeping 
it taut around the post. Presently 
there was a jerk. I began to pull 
in. Charles reappeared with a pair 
of remotors in tow. The rescue 
operation was slickly complete. 
“Fine,” he said, dusting himself 
down. “That’ll be twenty-five for 
the two of you, please.” The re- 
motors paid up without a mur- 
mur, digging the notes out of a 
large yellow bag. 

I accompanied the robots down 
the sensible path to the village. 
They seemed not to be suffering 
from any shortage of cash; I 
wanted to get them into the Treas- 
ure Trove among the souvenirs. 

“What a nice man,” remarked 
one of the remotors. I saw from 
the name tag that it was woman, 
Lucy Allbright. “How lucky that 
he happened to be around, Al.” 

Albert Allbright laughed. 
“Don’t kid yourself, Lucy. He 
makes useful money from his res- 
cue setup. And I wouldn’t be sur- 



104 



GALAXY 




prised if our friend here were in on 
it, too.” 

“Not me,” I said hastily. “I own 
a gift shop. My name’s Green, by 
the way.” 

“Glad to meet you, Mr. Green.” 
They introduced themselves un- 
necessarily. “You must be 
Green’s Cream,” remarked Al. 

“We have to take some of that 
back,” added Lucy. 

“All genuine stuff,” I mur- 
mured. 

“I’m sure. We first came here 
over forty years ago, you know.” I 
couldn’t tell whether the statement 
was intended to be significant. 
“Haven’t been back since. From 
where we are now, it looks much 
the same, doesn’t it, Lucy?” 

This couple must be pretty old, 
I decided. They were the sort of 
tourists we wanted. Sentimental 
and with money to spare. 

I TOOK them to the Treasure 
Trove and introduced them to 
Sylvia. In minutes they were chat- 
ting with her like old friends — Syl- 
via has this effect on people — 
so I left the three of them at the 
table. The Tea Room seats about 
twenty-five and there were one or 
two Fulltime villagers in, drinking 
coffee and eating buns, generally 
adding a touch of local color. 
This is very necessary. Remotors 
do not, obviously, eat or drink — 
but remotorists like to sit down 
from time to time in an authentic 



atmosphere and watch other folks 
or chat with locals. The Tea 
Room, basically, serves as a meet- 
ing place where remotorists get 
to know each other in attractive 
surroundings, buy Green’s Cream, 
and then wander around the Trea- 
sure Trove, spending the rest of 
their budget for the day. 

I passed through the doorway 
that separates the Tea Room from 
the Shoppe and was pleased to Find 
the latter full of chattering re- 
motors lurching among the 
counters on spindly legs, spending 
freely. 

Well satisfied, I let myself out 
and strolled along the waterfront 
to the Smugglers’ Arms. The pub- 
lic bar at this hour was almost 
empty; Jack Rivers was swabbing 
the counter in desultory fashion, 
the air smelled of disinfectant 
and the parrot was muttering un- 
pleasantly to itself, occasional- 
ly plucking at the bars of its cage 
like an ill-tempered harpist. I or- 
dered a pint and sat down. 

“Aah, it be a fine mornin’, 
stranger.” 

“For God’s sake, Bert,” I 
snapped. “It’s me, Green.” 

“Oh, I beg your pardon, Mr. 
Green.” The old man’s eyes fo- 
cused with rheumy difficulty. 
“All the same, I’ll have a pint, 
please.” 

“Not from me you won’t. Wait 
till the tourists start coming in.” 

Bert Jennings is the village char- 
acter and quite good at it. His line 



THE SHARKS OF PENTREATH

is to trade homespun philosophy 
and weather forecasts for drinks 
while sitting in an ancient wheel- 
back chair in the corner of the bar. 
The romotourists spot him and 
cluster around as he clutches an 
empty mug in both mittened, 
arthritic hands and tells them the 
history of the village in a quaver- 
ing voice. After a while the remo- 
tors buy him a drink and move 
away, pick up a stone jar of home- 
made Cornish Mead to take back 
to the Center, and drift out into 
the street, to be replaced by fur- 
ther seekers after information. 
We have an arrangement in Pen- 
treath. If a remotourist wants 
details of village history, we send 
them to Bert. While the rest of us 
sell souvenirs and experiences, 
he sells words. 

I often wonder what happens 
while we are all on Shelflife and 
the village is in the hands of Ro- 
tomation 2 and 3. Do they, too, 
have their village sage? Once or 
twice while at the Center I have 
contemplated sending my remo- 
tor to Pentreath to find out exact- 
ly what goes on, but I have never 
gotten around to it; there are too 
many other places to see. 

“Hi, John. Thanks for the cus- 
tomers.” Charles Judd was stand- 
ing at the bar. He handed me a 
beer. 

“Thanks. I took them into the 
Tea Room after, and let Sylvia 
loose on them.” 

Charles smiled. “A wife in a mil- 



lion. She makes more money with 
her personality than you with all 
your schemes.” 

“I’m not too sure about that.” I 
frowned. They don’t know what it’s 
like to live with somebody who 
seems to like everyone except me. 
“She sometimes forgets that we 
do all this for money.” 

“Come off it, John. You know 
you couldn’t do without her.” 

I fought back my irritation. 
Barroom banter is not my line. 
“Sometimes I wish it were per- 
missible to exchange Rotoma- 
tions. I’d like to see some new 
faces.” 

“Fine,” he chuckled. “Leave her 
with me. Oh, by the way — ” He sat 
down, pulled his chair close. “I 
heard some disturbing news to- 
day. From a fellow on Rotoma- 
tion Two, who came here last year, 
while Rotomation Three was in 
charge.” 

“Oh?” 

“It seems they dropped prices all 
around and advertised the fact. 
It's the first I’ve heard about it. I 
don’t think it’ll be the last. This 
guy on Two wanted a small repair 
job done this morning. He called 
me a crook when I told him the 
price.” 

“What?” This was serious. 
Those of us who own our busi- 
nesses let them to other Rotoma- 
tions on the strict understand- 
ings that prices be maintained. 
“We’ll have to put this before the 
Chamber of Commerce,” I said. 



106 



GALAXY 




“And I tell you another thing. 
Ewell’s selling cream in his Grot- 
to.” 

“What?” Poaching on one an- 
other’s preserves is something we 
don’t do. I got to my feet. “I’ll deal 
with this right away. I’ll have that 
little swine thrown out of the 
Chamber!” 

“Hold it. He’s not a member. 
His is a temporary structure. He 
doesn’t pay local siterates eith- 
er.” 

“I know that.” I charged out of 
the bar, incensed. I had to see Syl- 
via immediately. She had helped 
Ewell set up his stall this morning. 
She must have seen the cream. 
What the hell was she thinking of? 

I STORMED into the Tea 
Room to find Sylvia still seated 
at a table with the Allbrights. This 
did not improve my temper. She 
should have been showing them 
around the Treasure Trove by 
now. She looked up as I entered. 

“Oh, John.” She smiled at me 
brightly, insensitive to my 
mood. “Mr. Allbright was just 
telling me. Did you know— he 
knew this place before Rotoma- 
tion? They spent their honeymoon 
here. He says the place has hardly 
changed.” 

“Sit down, Mr. Green.” The re- 
motourist waved me to a vacant 
chair. “That’s right, Sylvia. Mind 
you, the people have changed. I 
don’t suppose any of the old ones 
are left now.” 



“I wonder if you knew Bert Jen- 
nings,” Sylvia said. 

“Had you thought of taking a 
fishing trip?” I asked hastily. 

“Bert Jennings? That wouldn’t 
be young Bert — do you remem- 
ber, Lucy? He showed us how to 
catch bass? I wonder now — ” The 
remotor fell silent, thinking 
then: “Where can we find him?” 
“He’ll be in the Smugglers’. He’s 
always there at this hour.” Sylvia 
seemed determined to send our 
customers elsewhere. 

“What luck,” exclaimed All- 
bright. “We must have a word with 
him. I’m sure it’s the same man. 
You know — ” He looked around, 
cylindrical head pivoting, “You’ve 
done a wonderful job with this 
place. It’s almost exactly as I re- 
member it. You can’t know what 
it means to Lucy and me to come 
back here and see it all again.” 
“Last time I suppose the village 
was packed with Fulltime tour- 
ists,” Sylvia remarked. 

“You can’t imagine the 
crowds — of course, everyone was 
Fulltime then. It was two years be- 
fore Rotomation came in — earth 
was crowded, believe me. You 
could hardly move. The roads 
were one solid traffic jam. But 
now, well, look at the coaches we 
came in. Three hundred people in 
such a small space. Oh, yes Ro- 
tomation was a wonderful idea.” 
“And it solved the food prob- 
lem, Al. Don’t forget that,” Lucy 
pointed out. 



THE SHARKS OF PENTREATH

“Oh, yes. Things were getting 
difficult. I won’t say we were 
starving — but some of us were 
hungry. Now- in two years Shell- 
life a person only consumes a 
few gallons of drip. Of course, we 
all eat during our Fulltime year 
but that’s only one-third of the 
population.” 

“How do you enjoy Shelflife?” 
asked Sylvia. “After having 
known what it was like before.” 

“Fine. I’m packed away com- 
fortably in Gloucester. I’m con- 
scious of my mind and body being 
there but only when I think about 
it. In my first two years Shelflife I 
adapted completely. It seemed 
strange to go on Fulltime again 
when my Rotomation came 
round.” 

“The remotors are good,” said 
Lucy, nodding her shining head in 
a way which somehow betrayed 
her real age. 

I was still trembling with rage; I 
wanted to get Sylvia alone. I think 
they sensed it. 

“Well.” Allbright stood up sud- 
denly. “We must be going. My, it 
feels good to be young again. My 
real body’s pretty feeble now, you 
know.” 

In an effort to be polite I man- 
aged to join the conversation at 
last. “You won’t try to take your 
wife down that cliff in your next 
Fulltime, then?” 

I had been tactless. I could tell 
by the pause before he replied but 
I was too mad at Sylvia to care. 



“We’re truly young only once,” 
he replied at last quietly. “It’s al- 
ways as well to make the best of 
things while you can, Mr. Green.” 
He glanced from Sylvia to my- 
self. “Remotors are good but 
they’re no substitute for flesh and 
blood. We climbed that cliff over 
forty years ago. We won’t do it 
again.” 

His wife spoke. “Where do you 
recommend we go now, dear?” she 
asked Sylvia. 

“You must see Gordon Ewell’s 
Grotto,” she replied at once. 
“And then why not slip into the 
Smugglers’ and have a word with 
Bert Jennings?” 

“Fine. That would be interest- 
ing. Oh, and before we go, I must 
have some of your cream to take 
back.” 

“I shouldn’t bother now,” said 
Sylvia. “You don’t want to carry 
it about all day. You can pick it up 
later. The Grotto sells it as well, if 
that’s nearer for you.” 

T HE sight of a woman crying 
moves me to fury. It is unnec- 
essary; an attempt to take unfair 
advantage, calculated to turn 
logical defeat into a moral vic- 
tory. I suppose she expected me 
to apologize. 

“And you can cut out the tears,” 
I told her. “Once and for all, get it 
into your head that we’re in this 
for the money. To save for our 
Shelflife so that we can send our 
remotors out anywhere we like 



108 



GALAXY 




and enjoy ourselves. We get peo- 
ple in and w esell. Is that clear?” 
“But why can’t we enjoy our- 
selves all the time?” she asked. 
“Do we have to behave like the 
other sharks in the village? Like 
your friend Charles?” 

“Charles is okay. He’s a good 
businessman. What about your 
friend Ewell and his fake Grotto?” 
“John, everyone knows Gor- 
don’s Grotto is fake. The tourists 
know it. There’s no pretense about 
it. Gordon’s a nice fellow.” 

I could feel the rage boiling up 
again, a sick volcano in my 
stomach. “By God, anyone would 
think you were in love with that 
lousy little creep.” I was losing 
control of myself; I seized her by 
the shoulders and shook her. “Are 
you, Sylvia? Are you?” 

She bit her lip and gave me a pa- 
tient look; I very nearly slapped 
her face. “You know I’m not, 
John,” she said quietly. “I’m in 
love with you. But sometimes I 
wish you could be a bit less — hard. 
This isn’t dog eat dog — that sort of 
life finished when Rotomation 
came in. There’s plenty for all of 
us.” 

“And how the hell did he ‘get to 
selling cream?” I raged. “You 
helped him this morning. You 
must have seen it.” 

“I didn’t think — ” 

“Where does he get it from? 
Where does he get this fake cream 
he sells in his fake Grotto?” 

“I believe it’s the same brand as 



ours. He just puts a different la- 
bel on it, as we do.” 

“What? He doesn’t even have 
any cows — ” My head was spin- 
ning; I felt dizzy with rage and 
frustration. I swung around and 
left Sylvia standing there, her 
cheeks wet, her eyes wide and stu- 
pid. I slammed out the back way 
and strode into the field. The 
Herefords were grouped around 
the rear of the building. My gun 
was in the wooden shed. The can- 
vas of Ewell’s Grotto shone white 
in the sun. My hands were wet and 
shaking. 

T HEY say a thunderstorm 
clears the air. This may be so in 
other parts of the country but it 
doesn’t usually apply to Pen- 
treath. Here a fine spell may be 
broken by a storm, which is often 
the precursor of further storms 
and endless drizzling rain, day af- 
ter day. 

But the late afternoon of the first 
day of the tourist season was still 
delightful. The sun continued to 
shine unabated and as I climbed 
the cliff path life seemed pretty 
good. I reached the grassy knoll at 
the top and turned to admire the 
view. Across the tiny bay, on the 
opposite headland, were the two 
coaches, childrens’ toys in the 
hard light. The village lay beneath 
me, the boats bobbing at anchor 
as the ebbing remnants of last 
night’s heavy seas slapped against 
the quay. The village street glitter-

ed with promenading remotors; the 
wreckage of Ewell’s Grotto lay at 
the near end, canvas flattened and 
tent poles askew. There had been 
no customers for my boats but 1 
was not particularly bothered; the 
Treasure Trove was doing well and 
I had decided to take the afternoon 
off; Sylvia and the assistants could 
cope. 

“Lovely afternoon, Mr. Green.” 

I jumped, startled, and turned 
round. Two remotors were sitting 
further along the cliff, telescopic 
legs dangling over the edge. 

“Oh, hello, Mr. All- 
bright — Mrs. Allbright. Yes, it’s 
very nice,” 1 replied none too en- 
thusiastically. I find I am happi- 
est when alone — inane conversa- 
tion bores me. I leave that to Syl- 
via. 

“It must be very pleasant living 
here for your Fulltime,” re- 
marked Mrs. A. “You’re very 
lucky.” 

I don’t like being told I’m 
lucky. “What do you do?” I asked. 

“I work in a synthetics plant,” 
replied Allbright. “Hard work for 
a man of my age. You have to 
watch the machinery. Particular- 
ly in January after the previous 
Rotomation goes off. There’s 
never much maintenance done in 
December. They’re too busy 
thinking what they’re going to do 
with their Shelflife.” 

Across the bay a hooter brayed. 

“Time to be getting back to the 
coaches,” observed Allbright. 



They stood up. “Would you mind 
walking back with us, Mr. Green? 
I’ve got an idea which might inter- 
est you.” 

Together we descended to the 
village. “The Grotto looks a 
mess,” I observed. “It’s better to 
build solidly even if it does mean 
paying local siterates.” 

“I think it’s a shame,” said Mrs. 
Allbright. “You can tell a lot of 
work’s gone into that place. When 
I saw those cows stampeding 
through and smashing it all up, I 
could have cried for the poor 
man.” 

“I wonder what set those cattle 
running,” speculated her husband. 
“You could have lost a lot of 
money yourself, Mr. Green. Here- 
fords are valuable beasts.” 

“I was lucky,” I said. “You 
know, they’ve never done it be- 
fore. I expect they were nervous 
after last night’s storm and some 
sudden noise startled them. Al- 
though I can’t say I’m too sorry 
about the Grotto. It’s a fake. I feel 
it lowers the tone of the village.” 

“I think it’s fun,” said the old 
woman. “And how do you mean, a 
fake?” 

“Well — it’s not genuine.” 

She laughed. “Oh, dear. Well 
now, just tell me what is.” 

“My Herefords are genuine.” 

“In what way? Do they have any 
practical use as cows used to? Do 
the boats and the Smugglers’ 
Haunt and your Tea Room — and 
Bert Jennings?”

“Bert Jennings?” I was puzzled 
and a little annoyed. 

“Which is the real Bert Jen- 
nings?” she asked. “The old char- 
acter who sits in the bar for one 
year out of three, putting on his 
act, or the remotor who goes ski- 
ing and flying and climbs Everest 
for the other two years? On a time 
basis it ought to be the remo- 
tor.” 

“Don’t worry about it, Mr. 
Green.” A 1 1 bright chuckled. 
“Lucy gets these moods. She has 
few illusions — both of us have. 
The point is, we came here on our 
honeymoon — ages ago — and we 
had a wonderful time. Today, af- 
ter all these years, we thought we'd 
come back and see the old place. 
We didn’t expect to find it quite 
the same and it wasn’t. But it’s still 
wonderful. You’ve all done a 
great job of maintaining the ap- 
pearance; the sea is still here — and 
the beach and the harbor and the 
cliffs. It's still Pentreath. And as 
for fake souvenirs and synthetic 
cream and shabby sideshows, 
well, they had those forty years 
ago, too. I tell you, nothing’s 
changed very much. There’s no 
need to feel defensive about 
things here.” 

The path narrowed and they 
moved ahead. 1 saw they were 
actually holding hands. Two re- 
motors holding hands, for God’s 
sake, like a couple of starcrossed 
lovers. 1 thought about Sylvia 
and myself in forty years’ time . 



We were passing the Treasure 
Trove when he made his sugges- 
tion. The narrow street was full of 
gleaming remotors stilting their 
way toward the coaches. 

“It used to be a guest house, you 
know. They put people up for the 
night as the Smugglers’ did. Have 
you ever thought of doing so again 
in those bedrooms upstairs? No- 
body else in the village does. I’ve 
asked.” 

“But we don’t get guests,” I ob- 
jected. “Everyone works during 
Fulltime except the very rich and 
they go abroad.” 

“I mean putting remotors up in 
proper rooms, in beds, instead of 
just packing them away for the 
night. It’d be a novel idea. You 
could advertise all-inclusive 
fishing weeks.” 

“Remotors in beds?” I couldn't 
help laughing the idea seemed so 
ridiculous. 

“No, I’m serious. Lucy and I 
would have enjoyed staying in a 
real bedroom and having a whole 
week here. Delivery could be ar- 
ranged with the coach people. Af- 
ter all, even remotourists get 
tired of rushing from place to 
place all me time, particularly the 
older ones like us.” 

Most tourists, if you allow 
yourself to get drawn into con- 
versation, will make suggestions 
as to how trade could be im- 
proved. I thought I’d heard it 
all — from paddle steamers to 
traveling circuses. But I’d never

before heard of letting furnished 
bedrooms to remotors. They can- 
not experience discomfort, so 
what’s wrong with the trundling 
coach, which saves overnight time 
between one stop and the next? 
And in any case, why should any- 
one want to spend more than one 
day in any place? The truth of the 
matter was, they were a couple of 
sentimentalists who wanted to 
relive their ancient honeymoon 
in as much detail as possible. 
Fulltime traveling is expensive 
and cuts into valuable money- 
earning days. 

I was still chuckling to myself 
as, hand in steel hand, they climbed 
the hill to the coach park. The 
shadow of the setting sun pur- 
sued us up the slope; the village 
was in dusk against the crimson- 
capped black hillside. 

We reached the coaches. All- 
bright extended a silver claw. 
“Goodbye, Mr. Green,” he said. 
“Would you say thank you to Syl- 
via for us for making our day so 
pleasant.” 

He turned to his wife. “Bye, 
Lucy,” he said. 

“See you in Bristol, Al.” They 
stood in silence for a moment, 
then slowly Mrs. Allbright with- 
drew herself into a cube. The 
coach driver, damp cigarette ad- 
hering to his lower lip, picked up 
the remotor and slid it into the 
rear entrance to the vehicle. 

Allbright turned away and 
stalked across to the other coach. 



I followed, puzzled. “What goes 
on?” I asked. 

“This is my coach,” he replied 
shortly. 

“I don’t understand,” I mut- 
tered. I suddenly got an inkling 
of something I didn’t want to 
know. 

“It’s quite simple, Mr. Green. 
Lucy and I married young and 
hastily. Soon we fought. I think 
you know how married couples 
can fight. We thought we hated 
each other. In two years we were 
divorced. Single people again. 
Free. You understand?” 

“No.” But I understood. Oh, 
God, I understood. 

“Rotomation came along. They 
put us on different shifts. We kept 
in touch and met again as re- 
motors. There are certain things in 
life we find out too late. Mistakes 
we cannot correct.” 

It is not permissible to exchange 
Rotomations. 

“I haven’t seen Lucy — seen 
her — for forty years.” 

He stiffened and began to sink to 
the ground. I watched. 

At my feet was a silver box with 
hairline cracks on the top. 

An inert, lifeless silver box; the 
driver lifted it into the coach. 

A piece of precision machinery. 

A cube. 

I turned and ran toward the set- 
ting sun, toward the village, 
Sylvia. The sun must have been 
strong because my eyes were 
smarting. ★

The scientific rationale for The 
Year of the Cloud is convincingly 
worked out, as it was in Clone. The 
menace is as deceptively simple 
as was the life form that grew out 
of the sewers. This time, it’s a grad- 
ual increase in the viscosity of the 
Earth’s water, which, as worked 
out by the authors, can be seen to 
be quite sufficient for the total 
destruction of life on Earth as we 
know it, and not too quietly, either. 
The cities of the Earth are de- 
stroyed, about fifty percent of the 
population is dead before the book 
even begins to peak out, and there 
is literally no place to hide. Never- 
theless this is a bad book, and 
Clone was a good book. 

This is a bad book in many ways. 
The writing is dull through long 
sections. Although the pro- 
tagonists move across consider- 
able distances of land, with the ac- 
tion ranging from Hawaii to San 
Francisco, from San Francisco to 
New York, and from New York to 
the Bahamas, one gets neither a 
sense of actual motion on their 
part, nor the feeling that the book 
is advancing very far. Some of the 
syntax is idosyncratic, or at least 
parochial. Several times one en- 
counters a sentence such as “The 
cities of the coastal plains didn’t 
stand a chance even.” 

This and several similar recur- 
ring quirks strike the reader rather 
hard, particularly since they 



( Continued from page 3 ) 

invariably come at the end of long, 
slow, descriptive passages which 
are probably intended to convey 
the mood of enervation settling 
over the protagonists as their 
energies flag and their despair 
mounts. But the mood passages are 
too long and too similar to the 
narrative taffy-pulling used by 
standard daytime television serial 
writers. 

Then, some rather promising 
characters pop into being — notably 
the girl who eventually settles 
down to become the mate of one 
of the chief protagonists. She’s an 
extremely complex character, 
with a great many half-delineated 
traits. But she simply appears in 
the book, and then turns out to be 
occupying a hefty number of 
words in it, without ever really 
contributing very much to its 
progress and without undergoing 
any great change of her own. 

(Personally, the one thing I do 
wish I knew more about was 
exactly how she learned how to be- 
come an excellent journalistic 
photographer simply by having 
done a stint posing for dirty pic- 
tures. There are very few similari- 
ties in the field conditions, the 
lighting techniques, or the equip- 
ment required). 

What I’m really saying with all 
of these quibbles is not that any 
given sentence in the book is dull. 
Neither Kate nor Ted have staked 



113 




any major claims as prose poets, 
but both of them are narrators 
talented enough to evoke a poetic 
mood, or any other mood they 
select. When they’ve got it rolling, 
they can induce a sense of unim- 
peded flow and a breathless sus- 
pension of not only disbelief but 
of any other sense that might inter- 
fere between the reader and his 
enjoyment of the story. 

So what this book really doesn’t 
have is that essential ingredient 
of tension which would override 
the occasional lapse in prose tech- 
nique that can occur with a col- 
laborative book. The mixture is 
almost as it was in Clone , but 
what is missing, finally, 1 think, is 
that sense of purposefulness on 
the part of the cloud through which 
the Earth passes at the beginning 
of all the events. 

It is true that at the end, the 
book suddenly throws in a refer- 
ence to the fact that the cloud can’t 
have occurred there by accident. 
It must have been “placed." 
(Where is the evidence for this?) 

But by the time this brick ar- 
rives in place of a life-ring, it’s 
either a copout or an auctorial 
admission of awareness that the 
book is in serious trouble and 
needs a quick shot of adrenalin. 
Else it marks the spot where 
Wilhelm and Thomas should have 
begun a science-fiction novel of 
alien meddling, rather than a novel 
of science-fiction horror. That lat- 
ter, I think, is what they were try- 



ing for. And this review, I hope, 
is an effort to start them thinking 
on how they might organize their 
next plot, because when they do it 
right they do it very well. 

A VON BOOKS, as some of you 
■might know, was a genuine 
power in paperback publishing 
some twenty years ago, when it and 
Signet represented the only serious 
rivals to Pocket on the newsstands. 
There have been many evolution- 
ary changes in publishing since 
then, and 1 have no idea of the 
present net worth of Avon as com- 
pared to, for instance, the Olympia 
Press. But just looking at news- 
stands, employing roughly the 
same sensory equipment I was us- 
ing twenty years ago, I would say 
that Avon is on its way back, 
strongly, under the editorial di- 
rection of George Ernsberger. 

Among other things, George has 
produced a recent series of highly 
attractive and well qualified 
science-fiction books. But the one 
I want to talk about is one I bought 
on my own hook, because it falls 
in with my predeliction for politi- 
cal thriller fiction (Fail-Safe, Sev- 
en Days in May, etc.). This is a 
book called Pre-Empt by John 
Vorhies (Avon/V2273/75^), and is 
beyond a doubt the best book in 
this genre that has ever crossed my 
horizon. I’ve no idea who Vorhies 
is, but he not only understands 
politics, and realpolitik and all 



114

that other stuff, he also under- 
stands narrative. 

You have to get past the rather 
unfortunate graphic design and 
blurb writing on the cover. In fact, 
as usual, you’re better off ignor- 
ing the blurbs. 

Vorhies’ sense of narrative is so 
strong that he’s able to make a vir- 
tue of a technique that usually 
fails. That is, he tells the story en- 
tirely in the form of letters and 
memos covering the events. 

The crucial event is the muti- 
nous seizure of the nuclear sub- 
marine Nathan Hale by its cap- 
tain, who supplied with a number 
of thermonuclear missiles, and 
equipped with enough resources to 
stay underwater and undetected 
for months, informs the world that 
unless it convenes an interna- 
tional council to supervise and en- 
force nuclear disarmament, he 
will begin hitting the world’s 
major cities one by one. 

In the beginning, of course, both 
the captain’s scheme and the book 
itself sound like another melo- 
dramatic potboiler. As depicted 
on the cover of Pre-Empt, and as 
originally pictured in the initial 
reports about him, he is a rigid 
militarist who has suddenly 
turned completely fanatical and is 
waving his fists in all directions, 
playing with his big toy. But 
Vorhies is considerably smarter 
than that, and soon begins to show 
it at a skillfully measured and 
perfectly controlled pace. 



Bit by bit, paragraph by para- 
graph, memo by memo, Vorhies 
begins turning the captain and 
his scheme into creations of com- 
plete credibility. As events develop 
and such parties as the President 
of the United States and the Pre- 
mier of the Soviet Union, as well as 
the Chairman of the U.S. Senate 
Armed Services Committee, be- 
gin delving into the background 
of these events, detail matches with 
detail. It becomes obvious that 
what is happening here may be a 
conspiracy launched twenty-five 
years ago— That is to say, in the 
late 1940s. But more likely it may 
be, simply, the effect of the envi- 
ronment of the past quarter-cen- 
tury on the hearts and minds of 
sincere, capable individuals en- 
trusted with awesome technologi- 
cal and/or political power. 

Which is to say that Vorhies 
moves us through successive 
layers of melodrama and then 
drama and finally something very 
much resembling documentary 
narrative, while simultaneously 
moving us down through in- 
creasingly complex layers of 
reader involvement. What begins 
as something on approximately 
the level of Thunderbolt quickly at- 
tains and overtakes the pseudo- 
profundity of Fail-Safe, the rou- 
tine mechanics of Red Alert, the 
slick irony of Dr. Strangelove, and 
begins taking on the proportions 
of a major statement. 

Pre-Empt verges on going be-

yond the specific problem of 
political man and nuclear power 
and gets very close to being a novel 
about Man and power. It’s a hell of 
a book as a literary accomplish- 
ment, particularly for something 
that turns up on the newsstands 
with a thriller cover on it. 

N OW, the book takes some po- 
sitions with which one might 
seriously quarrel. The ostensible 
villain — that is to say, the force 
which eventually defeats the on- 
set of genuine world disarma- 
ment — is the American political 
system, as exemplified by the 
relationship shown here between 
the legislative branch and the 
executive. 

At the end of the book, as we 
have known from the beginning, 
Congress successfully impeaches 
the President for having “sur- 
rendered American sovereignty,” 
although the immediate excuse is 
a convenient trumped-up charge. 

We are shown that under the 
circumstances of the present 
nuclear state, it is impossible for 
the individual chief executive to 
make genuine individual deci- 
sions in the event of nuclear crisis; 
that the inertia of twenty-five 
years of legislative decision, en- 
twined with twenty-five years of 
military /executive decisions and 
preconceptions, have robbed the 
chief executive of any genuine 
power to react in any original 
manner. 



Since none of the pre-set plans 
include automatic procedures for 
dealing with hopeful nuclear situa- 
tions, the President — the man who 
supposedly has his own finger on 
the button — is in fact powerless to 
react in any manner save destruc- 
tively. If he does attempt to react 
in what this book depicts as a 
sane, sensible and noble manner, 
he does save the world from nu- 
clear holocaust for the time being, 
but he does so at the price of his 
own career and honor, and in the 
end he gains nothing — the system 
defeats all nobility and returns the 
world to a position even a little 
closer to catastrophe than it was 
before the President, the Premier 
and the captain of the Nathan 
Hale all laid their lives, their for- 
tunes and their sacred honor on 
the line. 

It is possible in reading this 
book to draw the conclusion that 
the American system is the true 
villain in this world; that the sum 
total of all the decisions made 
since the United States took the 
responsibility of nuclear power 
has so crystallized our posture 
that we, uniquely among all the 
nations of the world, have the 
simple choice either of preserving 
the condition of marginal catas- 
trophe, or of completely dissolv- 
ing our political and national 
structure. And naturally, like any 
other organism, we would rather 
die than change. 

But that’s a false premise, I 



116 



GALAXY 




think, even on Vorhies’ own terms. 
As depicted here, these are essen- 
tially personal conflicts. The 
Premier of the Soviet Union acts in 
the end not as the Premier, but as a 
man who, while young and 
attached to the Soviet Diplomatic 
Mission in Washington, D.C., 
formulated a world disarmament 
plan out of his own idealism, and 
out of his concern for the future 
safety of Mother Russia. The 
“renegade” sea captain, (who is 
magnificently depicted despite 
never appearing onstage), turns 
out to have been a similar sort of 
person. The President of the 
United States is, 1 think, basically 
a political creature, but with a 
basic underlayer of sound, mid- 
dle-American common sense. On 
the other hand, many of the sena- 
tors and congressmen and military- 
figures depicted here are car- 
toons straight out of Strangelove. 
They have funny names and A1 
Capp personalities. 

Still other supporting char- 
acters are neither realistic nor car- 
toony; they have names like Robert 
Fitsgerald, and are addressed as 
“Bobby,” in the manner of Allen 
Drury. 

So when you begin looking at it 
hard, it becomes plain that Vor- 
hies had an argument he wanted to 
make even if it meant warping the 
structure of his analogy. The re- 
sult is an extremely readable crea- 
tion and a necessarily thought- 
provoking one, but one that 



undermines its own logical foot- 
ing so that it falls short of objec- 
tive truth. 

Every piece of fiction falls short 
of objective truth, but political 
fiction — political science fic- 
tion, in this case — has, or should 
have, certain higher obligations 
to meet. Despite all that, Pre-Empt 
is a cracking good input to add to 
your picture of the world, but it 
disqualifies itself from candida- 
ture for a complete picture of the 
world as it really is. 

What it is, really, is what would 
happen if you took Tom Sherred’s 
E For Effort , (which, incidentally, 
was also written in this manner) 
and wanted to make a novel. Defi- 
nitely, in that event, this is the kind 
of novel you would want to make. 

N orman spinrad is a 

bright and talented fellow. The 
temptation is to refer to him as a 
young fellow and as a new writer 
on the horizon. But he’s not that 
young any more and his work has 
been around for some time. Avon 
has just reprinted his collection, 
The Last Hurrah of the Golden 
Horde , containing stories whose 
copyright dates range upward 
from 1963 (a period in which he 
was writing for Analog with rea- 
sonable frequency) on up through 
1969, when he was doing what ap- 
pears to be his most interesting 
work, for New Worlds. 

This book (Avon Science Fiction 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



117 




Novel V2368, 750) displays no par- 
ticular consistent style. Outward 
Bound could easily have been 
written by Poul Anderson. The 
Equalizer has certain strong re- 
semblances to Mack Reynolds’ 
work. Gordon Dickson could eas- 
ily have written The Last of the 
Romany, Technicality is much like 
a Randall Garrett story, and 
Subjectivity has a tendency to re- 
semble something by Christopher 
Anvil. 

Perhaps this is the kind of thing 
that Spinrad meant when he dedi- 
cated this book to The Grand Old 
Men of Science Fiction. Of course 
that doesn’t explain the re- 
semblance of Carcinoma Angels to 
something by Harlan Ellison. 
Nor does it explain the resem- 
blance of The Entropic Gang Bang 
Caper and The Last Hurrah of the 
Golden Horde to the kind of thing 
the general run of New Worlds 
writers were trying to write in 
roughly the same way the Analog 
boys a few years ago were trying 
to write a particular kind of thing 
for Analog. 

Reading these stories you 
become struck by Spinrad’s 
breadth of awareness and by his 
ability to write a number of dif- 
ferent styles well. He never rises 
above the level of simple, straight- 
forward competence, mind you. 
His version of a Poul Anderson 
story, for instance, although some 
sort of special project in his own 
mind, is no better than any given 



story by Poul Anderson in the 
course of unreeling a whole 
stream of such creations. The 
snapper endings on Once More 
With Feeling and on It's A Bird, 
It’s A Plane are telegraphed from 
the very beginning, as is the one 
on Death Watch. But that latter is 
from Playboy, where jangling sur- 
prises tend to dismay. The Last of 
the Romany delivers a genuine 
emotional punch. Unfortunately, 
it’s the same type of punch that 
this type of story has been deliver- 
ing at the hands of various people 
for many years now; we have to 
pass the credit back to John 
Campbell. 

Judging by what’s in this collec- 
tion, Spinrad would have no 
trouble at all in writing some- 
thing that was both individual and 
quite good. One might further 
guess that from having read Bug 
Jack Barron. But despite his capa- 
bilities as an individual, and his 
ability to adapt a wide variety of 
techniques, all Spinrad really 
shows us in this collection that 
can be said to be his individual and 
unimpeachable own is his at- 
titude, which is a rather likable 
one. 

Considered on its own merits, 
however, this collection is either 
a deliberate compilation of the 
kind of parody young writers love 
to do at parties or, alarmingly, it’s 
taking Spinrad a very long time to 
stop synthesizing and start speak- 
ing with his own voice. ★

THE 

HERO 



He had one wish 
left— to fight his 
last war in peace! 

GEORGE R. R. MARTIN 




T HE city was dead and the flames 
of its passing spread a red stain 
across the green-gray sky. 

It had been a long time 
dying. Resistance had lasted almost 
a week and the fighting had been 
bitter for a while. But in the end the 
invaders had broken the defenders, 
as they had broken so many others 
in the past. The alien sky with its 
double sun did not bother them. 
They had fought and won under 



skies of azure blue and speckled 
gold and inky black. 

The Weather Control boys had 
hit first, while the main force was 
still hundreds of miles to the east. 
Storm after storm had flailed at the 
streets of the city, to slow defen- 
sive preparations and smash the 
spirit of resistance. 

When they were closer the 
invaders had sent up howlers. Un- 
ending high-pitched shrieks had 



119 



echoed back and forth both day 
and night and before long most of 
the populace had fled in demoral- 
ized panic. By then the attackers’ 
main force was in range and 
launched plague bombs on a 
steady westward wind. 

Even then the natives had tried 
to fight back. From their defensive 
emplacements ringing the city the 
survivors had sent up a hail of 
atomics, managing to vaporize one 
whole company whose defensive 
screens were overloaded by the 
sudden assault. But the gesture was 
a feeble one at best. By that time 
incendiary bombs were raining 
down steadily upon the city and 
great clouds of acid gas were blow- 
ing across the plains. 

/^nd behind the gas, the dreaded 
assault squads of the Terran 
Expeditionary Force moved on the 
last defenses. 



K AGhN scowled at the dented 
plastoid helmet at his feet and 
cursed his luck. A routine 
mopping-up detail, he thought. A 
perfectly routine operation — and 
some damned automatic inter- 
ceptor emplacement somewhere 
had lobbed a low-grade atomic at 
him. 

It had been only a near miss but 
the shock waves had damaged his 
hip rockets and knocked him out 
of the sky, landing him in this god- 
forsaken little ravine east of the 
city. His light plastoid battle armor 



had protected him from the im- 
pact but his helmet had taken a 
good whack. 

Kagen squatted and picked up 
the dented helmet to examine it. 
His long-range com and all of his 
sensory equipment were out. With 
his rockets gone, too, he was 
crippled, deaf, dumb and half- 
blind. He swore. 

A flicker of movement along 
the top of the shallow ravine caught 
his attention. Five natives came 
suddenly into view, each carrying 
a hair-trigger submachine gun. 
They carried them at the ready, 
trained on Kagen. They were 
fanned out in line, covering him 
from both right and left. One began 
to speak. 

He never finished. One instant, 
Kagen’s screech gun lay on the 
rocks at his feet. Quite suddenly it 
was in his hand. 

Five men will hesitate where one 
alone will not. During the brief 
flickering instant before the na- 
tives’ fingers began to tighten on 
their triggers. Kagen did not 
pause, Kagen did not hesitate, Ka- 
gen did not think. 

Kagen killed. 

The screech gun emitted a loud, 
ear-piercing shriek. The enemy 
squad leader shuddered as the 
invisible beam of concentrated 
high-frequency sound ripped into 
him. Then his flesh began to 
liquefy. By then Kagen’s gun had 
found two more targets. 

The guns of the two remaining 



120 



GALAXY 




natives finally began to chatter. A 
rain of bullets enveloped Kagen as 
he whirled to his right and he 
grunted under the impact as the 
shots caromed off his battle armor. 
His screech gun leveled — and a 
random shot sent it spinning from 
his grasp. 

Kagen did not hesitate or pause 
as the gun was wrenched from his 
grip. He bounded to the top of the 
shallow ravine with one leap, 
directly toward one of the soldiers. 

The man wavered briefly and 
brought up his gun. The instant 
was all Kagen needed. With all the 
momentum of his leap behind it, 
his right hand smashed the gun butt 
into the enemy’s face and his left, 
backed by fifteen hundred pounds 
of force, hammered into the 
native’s body right under the 
breastbone. 

Kagen seized the corpse and 
heaved it toward the second 
native, who had ceased fire briefly 
as his comrade came between him- 
self and Kagen. Now his bullets 
tore into the airborne body. He 
took a quick step back, his gun 
level and firing. 

And then Kagen was on him. 
Kagen knew a searing flash of 
pain as a shot bruised his temple. 
He ignored it, drove the edge of his 
hand into the native’s throat. The 
man toppled, lay still. 

Kagen spun, still reacting, 
searching for the next foe. 

He was alone. 

Kagen bent and wiped the blood 



from his hand with a piece of the 
native’s uniform. He frowned in 
disgust. It was going to be a long 
trek back to camp, he thought, 
tossing the blood-soaked rag 
casually to the ground. 

Today was definitely not his 
lucky day. 

He grunted dismally, then 
scrambled back down into the 
ravine to recover his screech gun 
and helmet for the hike. 

On the horizon, the city was still 
burning. 

R AGELLI’S voice was loud and 
cheerful as it came crackling 
over the short-range communica- 
tor nestled in Kagen’s fist. 

“So it’s you, Kagen,” he said 
laughing. “You signaled just in 
time. My sensors were starting to 
pick up something. Little closer 
and I would’ve screeched you 
down.” 

“My helmet’s busted and the 
sensors are out,” Kagen replied. 
“Damn hard to judge distance. 
Long-range com is busted, too.” 
“The brass was wondering what 
happened to you,” Ragelli cut in. 
“Made ’em sweat a little. But I 
figured you’d turn up sooner or 
later.” 

“Right,” Kagen said. “One of 
these mudworms zapped the hell 
out of my rockets and it took me a 
while to get back. But I’m coming 
in now.” 

He emerged slowly from the 
crater he had crouched in, coming 



THE HERO

in sight of the guard in the dis- 
tance. He took it slow and easy. 

Outlined against the outpost 
barrier, Ragelli lifted a ponderous 
silver-gray arm in greeting. He 
was armored completely in a full 
duralloy battlesuit that made 
Kagen’s plastoid armor look like 
tissue paper, and sat in the trigger- 
seat of a swiveling screech-gun 
battery. A bubble of defensive 
screens enveloped him, turning his 
massive figure into an indistinct 
blur. 

Kagen waved back and began to 
eat up the distance between them 
with long, loping strides. He 
stopped just in front of the barrier, 
at the foot of Ragelli’s emplace- 
ment. 

“You look damned battered,” 
said Ragelli, appraising him from 
behind a plastoid visor, aided by 
his sensory devices. “That light 
armor doesn’t buy you a nickel’s 
worth of protection. Any farm boy 
with a pea shooter can plug you.” 

Kagen laughed. “At least 1 can 
move. You may be able to stand off 
an Assault Squad in that duralloy 
monkey suit, but I’d like to see you 
do anything on offense, chum. 
And defense doesn’t win wars.” 

“Your pot,” Ragelli said. “This 
sentry duty is boring as hell.” He 
flicked a switch on his control 
panel and a section of the barrier 
winked out. Kagen was through it 
at once. A split second later it came 
back on again. 

Kagen strode quickly to his 



squad barracks. The door slid open 
automatically as he approached it 
and he stepped inside gratefully. 
It felt good to be home again and 
back at his normal weight. These 
light-gravity mudholes made him 
queasy after awhile. The barracks 
were artificially maintained at 
Wellington-normal gravity, twice 
Earth-normal. It was expensive 
but the brass kept saying that 
nothing was too good for the com- 
fort of our fighting men. 

Kagen stripped off his plastoid 
armor in the squad ready room and 
tossed it into the replacement bin. 
He headed straight for his cubicle 
and sprawled across the bed. 

Reaching over to the plain metal 
table alongside his bed, he yanked 
open a drawer and took out a fat 
greenish capsule. He swallowed it 
hastily, and lay back to relax as it 
took hold throughout his system. 
The regulations prohibited taking 
synthastim between meals, he 
knew, but the rule was never en- 
forced. Like most troopers, Kagen 
took it almost continuously to 
maintain his speed and endurance 
at maximum. 

He was dozing comfortably a 
few minutes later when the com 
box mounted on the wall above his 
bed came to sudden life. 

“Kagen.” 

Kagen sat up instantly, wide 
awake. 

“Acknowledged,” he said. 

“Report to Major Grady at 
once.” 



122 



GALAXY 




Kagen grinned broadly. His 
request was being acted on quick- 
ly, he thought. And by a high 
officer, no less. Dressing quickly 
in loose-fitting brown fatigues, he 
set off across the base. 

The high officers’ quarters were 
at the center of the outpost. They 
consisted of a brightly lit, three- 
story building, blanketed over- 
head by defensive screens and 
ringed by guardsmen in light 
battle armor. One of the guards 
recognized Kagen and he was ad- 
mitted on orders. 

Immediately beyond the door he 
halted briefly as a bank of sensors 
scanned him for weapons. Troop- 
ers, of course, were not allowed to 
bear arms in the presence of high 
officers. Had he been carrying a 
screech gun alarms would have 
gone off all over the building while 
the tractor beams hidden in the 
walls and ceilings immobilized him 
completely. 

But he passed the inspection and 
continued down the long corridor 
toward Major Grady’s office. A 
third of the way down, the first set 
of tractor beams locked firmly 
onto his wrists. He struggled the 
instant he felt the invisible touch 
against his skin — but the tractors 
held him steady. Others, triggered 
automatically by his passing, 
came on as he continued down the 
corridor. 

Kagen cursed under his breath 
and fought with his impulse to 
resist. He hated being pinned by 



tractor beams, but those were the 
rules if you wanted to see a high 
officer. 

T HE door opened before him 
and he stepped through. A full 
bank of tractor beams seized him 
instantly and immobilized him. A 
few adjusted slightly and he was 
snapped to rigid attention, al- 
though his muscles screamed re- 
sistance. 

Major Carl Grady was working 
at a cluttered wooden desk a few 
feet away, scribbling something on 
a sheet of paper. A large stack of 
papers rested at his elbow, an old- 
fashioned laser pistol sitting on top 
of them as a paperweight. 

Kagen recognized the laser. It 
was some sort of heirloom, passed 
down in Grady’s family for genera- 
tions. The story was that some 
ancestor of his had used it back on 
Earth, in the Fire Wars of the early 
twenty-first century. Despite its 
age, the thing was still supposed to 
be in working order. 

After several minutes of silence 
Grady finally set down his pen and 
looked up at Kagen. He was 
unusually young for a high officer 
but his unruly gray hair made him 
look older than he was. Like all 
high officers, he was Earth-born; 
frail and slow before the assault 
squad troopers from the dense, 
heavy-gravity War Worlds of 
Wellington and Rommel. 

“Report your presence,” Grady 
said curtly. As always, his lean, 



THE HERO 



123 




pale face mirrored immense bore- 
dom. 

“Field Officer John Kagen, 
assault squads, Terran Expedi- 
tionary Force.” 

Grady nodded, not really listen- 
ing. He opened one of his desk 
drawers and extracted a sheet of 
paper. 

“Kagen,” he said, fiddling with 
the paper, “I think you know why 
you’re here.” He tapped the paper 
with his finger. “What’s the mean- 
ing of this?” 

“Just what it says. Major,” 
Kagen replied. He tried to shift his 
weight but the tractor beams held 
him rigid. 

Grady noticed and gestured 
impatiently. “At rest,” he said. 
Most of the tractor beams snapped 
off, leaving Kagen free to move, if 
only at half his normal speed. He 
flexed in relief and grinned. 

“My term of enlistment is up 
within two weeks, Major. I don’t 
plan to re-enlist. So I’ve requested 
transportation to Earth. That’s all 
there is to it.” 

Grady’s eyebrows arched a 
fraction of an inch but the dark 
eyes beneath them remained 
bored. 

“Really?” he asked. “You’ve 
been a soldier for almost twenty 
years now, Kagen. Why retire? 
I’m afraid I don’t understand.” 

Kagen shrugged. “I don’t know. 
I’m getting old. Maybe I’m just 
getting tired of camp life. It’s all 
starting to get boring, taking one 



damn mudhole after another. I 
want something different. Some 
excitement.” 

Grady nodded. “I see. But I 
don’t think I agree with you, 
Kagen.” His voice was soft and 
persuasive. “I think you’re under- 
selling the T.E.F. There is excite- 
ment ahead, if you’ll only give us a 
chance.” He leaned back in his 
chair, toying with a pencil he had 
picked up. “I’ll tell you some- 
thing, Kagen. You know, we’ve 
been at war with the Hrangan 
Empire for nearly three decades 
now. Direct clashes between us 
and the enemy have been few and 
far between up to now. Do you 
know why?” 

“Sure,” Kagen said. 

Grady ignored him. “I’ll tell you 
why,” he continued. “So far each 
of us has been struggling to con- 
solidate his position by grabbing 
these little worlds in the border 
regions. These mudholes, as you 
call them. But they’re very impor- 
tant mudholes. We need them for 
bases, for their raw materials, for 
their industrial capacity and for 
the conscript labor they provide. 
“That’s why we try to minimize 
damage in our campaigns. And 
that’s why we use psychwar tactics 
like the howlers. To frighten away 
as many natives as possible before 
each attack. To preserve labor.” 

“I know all that,” Kagen 
interrupted with typical Welling- 
ton bluntness. “What of it? I 
didn’t come here for a lecture.” 



124 



GALAXY 




Grady looked up from the pen- 
cil. “No,” he said. “No, you didn’t. 
So I’ll tell you, Kagen. The prelims 
are over. It’s time for the main 
event. There are only a handful of 
unclaimed worlds left. Soon now, 
we’ll be coming into direct conflict 
with the Hrangan Conquest Corps. 
Within a year we’ll be attacking 
their bases.” 

The major stared at Kagen 
expectantly, waiting for a reply. 
When none came, a puzzled look 
flickered across his face. He 
leaned forward again. 

“Don’t you understand, Kagen?” 
he asked. “What more excitement 
could you want? No more fighting 
these piddling civilians in uniform, 
with their dirty little atomics and 
their primitive projectile guns. The 
Hrangans are a real enemy. Like 
us, they’ve had a professional 
army for generations upon genera- 
tions. They’re soldiers, born and 
bred. Good ones, too. They’ve got 
screens and modern weapons. 
They’ll be foes to give our assault 
squads a real test.” 

“Maybe,” Kagen said doubt- 
fully. “But that kind of excitement 
isn’t what I had in mind. I’m 
getting old. I’ve noticed that I’m 
definitely slower lately — even 
Synthastim isn’t keeping up my 
speed.” 

G RADY shook his head. 

“You’ve got one of the best 
records in the whole T.E.F., 
Kagen. You’ve received the Stellar 



Cross twice and the World Con- 
gress Decoration three times. 
Every com station on Earth carried 
the story when you saved the land- 
ing party on Torego. Why should 
you doubt your effectiveness now? 
We’re going to need men like you 
against the Hrangans. Re-enlist.” 

“No,” said Kagen emphatically. 
“The regs say you’re entitled to 
your pension after twenty years 
and those medals have earned me a 
nice bunch of retirement bonuses. 
Now I want to enjoy them.” He 
grinned broadly. “As you say, 
everyone on Earth must know me. 
I’m a hero. With that reputation, I 
figure I can have a real screech- 
out.” 

Grady frowned and drummed on 
the desk impatiently. “I know 
what the regulations say, Kagen. 
But no one ever really re- 
tires — you must know that. Most 
troopers prefer to stay with the 
front. That’s their job. That’s what 
the War Worlds are all about.” 

“I don’t really care. Major,” 
Kagen replied. “I know the regs 
and I know I have a right to retire 
on full pension. You can’t stop 
me.” 

Grady considered the statement 
calmly, his eyes dark with thought. 

“All right,” he said after a long 
pause. “Let’s be reasonable about 
this. You’ll retire with full pension 
and bonuses. We’ll set you down on 
Wellington in a place of your own. 
Or Rommel if you like. We’ll make 
you a youth barracks director — 



THE HERO 



125 




any age group you like. Or a train- 
ing camp director. With your re- 
cord you can start right at the 
top.” 

“Uh-uh,” Kagen said firmly. 
“Not Wellington. Not Rommel. 
Earth.” 

“But why? You were born and 
raised on Wellington — in one of 
the hill barracks, 1 believe. You’ve 
never seen Earth.” 

“True,” said Kagen. “But I’ve 
seen it in camp telecasts and 
flicks. I like what Eve seen. Eve 
been reading about Earth a lot 
lately, too. So now I want to see 
what it’s like.” Fie paused, then 
grinned again. “Let’s just say I 
want to see what Eve been fighting 
for.” 

Grady’s frown reflected his dis- 
pleasure. “Em from Earth, 
Kagen,” he said. “I tell you, you 
won’t like it. You won’t fit in. The 
gravity is too low — and there are 
no artificial heavy gravity barracks 
to take shelter in. Synthastim is 
illegal, strictly prohibited. But War 
Wonders need it, so you’ll have to 
pay exorbitant prices to get the 
stuff. Earthers aren’t reaction 
trained, either. They’re a different 
kind of people. Go back to Well- 
ington. You’ll be among your own 
kind.” 

“Maybe that’s one of the reasons 
I want Earth,” Kagen said 
stubbornly. “On Wellington Em 
just one of hundreds of old vets. 
Hell, every one of the troopers who 
does retire heads back to his old 



barracks. But on Earth Ell be a 
celebrity. Why, Ell be the fastest, 
strongest guy on the whole damn 
planet. That’s got to have some ad- 
vantages.” 

Grady was starting to look agi- 
tated. “What about the gravity?” 
he demanded. “The Synthastim?” 

“Ell get used to light gravity 
after a while, that’s no problem. 
And 1 won’t be needing that much 
speed and endurance, so I figure I 
can kick the Synthastim habit.” 

Grady ran his fingers through his 
unkempt hair and shook his head 
doubtfully. There was a long, awk- 
ward silence. He leaned across the 
desk. 

And, suddenly, his hand darted 
towards the laser pistol. 

Kagen reacted. He dove for- 
ward, delayed only slightly by the 
few tractor beams that still held 
him. His hand flashed toward 
Grady’s wrist in a crippling arc. 

And suddenly wrenched to a halt 
as the tractor beams seized Kagen 
roughly, held him rigid and then 
smashed him to the floor. 

Grady, his hand frozen halfway 
to the pistol, leaned back in the 
chair. His face was white and 
shaken. He raised his hand and the 
tractor beams let up a bit. Kagen 
climbed slowly to his feet. 

“You see, Kagen,” said Grady. 
“That little test proves you’re as fit 
as ever. You’d have gotten me if I 
hadn’t kept a few tractors on you 
to slow you down. I tell you, we 
need men with your training and 



126 



GALAXY 




experience. We need you against 
the Hrangans. Re-enlist.” 

Kagen’s cold blue eyes still 
seethed with anger. “Damn the 
Hrangans,” he said. “I’m not re- 
enlisting and no goddamn little 
tricks of yours are going to make 
me change my mind. I’m going to 
Earth. You can’t stop me.” 

Grady buried his face in his 
hands and sighed. 

“All right, Kagen,” he said at 
last. “You win. I’ll put through 
your request.” 

He looked up one more time, 
and his dark eyes looked strangely 
troubled. 

“You’ve been a great soldier, 
Kagen. We’ll miss you. I tell you 
that you’ll regret this decision. Are 
you sure you won’t reconsider?” 
“Absolutely sure,” Kagen 
snapped. 

The strange look suddenly 
vanished from Grady’s eyes. His 
face once more took on the mask 
of bored indifference. 

“Very well,” he said curtly. 
“You are dismissed.” 

The tractors stayed on Kagen as 
he turned. They guided him — very 
firmly — from the building. 

WWOU ready, Kagen?” Ragelli 
tasked, leaning casually 
against the door of the cubicle. 

Kagen picked up his small travel 
bag and threw one last glance 
around to make sure he hadn’t for- 
gotten anything. He hadn’t. The 
room was quite bare. 



“Guess so,” he said, stepping 
through the door. 

Ragelli slipped on the plastoid 
helmet that had been cradled under 
his arm and hurried to catch up as 
Kagen strode down the corridor. 

“I guess this is it,” he said as he 
matched strides. 

“Yeah,” Kagen replied. “A 
week from now I’ll be taking it 
easy back on Earth while you’re 
getting blisters on your tail sitting 
around in that damned duralloy 
tuxedo of yours.” 

Ragelli laughed. “Maybe,” he 
said. “But I still say you’re nuts to 
go to Earth of all places, when you 
could command a whole damned 
training camp on Wellington. 
Assuming you wanted to quit at all, 
which is also crazy — ” 

The barracks door slid open be- 
fore them and they stepped 
through, Ragelli still talking. A 
second guard flanked Kagen on the 
other side. Like Ragelli, he was 
wearing light battle armor. 

Kagen himself was in full dress 
whites, trimmed with gold braid. A 
ceremonial laser, deactivated, was 
slung in a black leather holster at 
his side. Matching leather boots 
and a polished steel helmet set off 
the uniform. Azure blue bars on 
his shoulder signified field officer 
rank. His medals jangled against 
his chest as he walked. 

Kagen’s entire third assault 
squad was drawn up at attention 
on the spacefield behind the bar- 
racks in honor of his retirement. 



THE HERO 



127 




Alongside the ramp to the shuttle- 
craft, a group of high officers 
stood by, cordoned off by defen- 
sive screens. Major Grady was in 
the front row, his bored expression 
blurred somewhat by the screens. 

Flanked by the two guards, 
Kagen walked across the concrete 
slowly, grinning under his helmet. 
Piped music welled out over the 
field, and Kagen recognized the 
T.E.F. battle hymn and the 
Wellington anthem. 

At the foot of the ramp he turned 
and looked back. The company 
spread out before him saluted in 
unison on a command from the 
high officers and held the position 
until Kagen returned the salute. 
Then one of the squad’s other field 
officers stepped forward, and pre- 
sented him with his discharge 
papers. 

Jamming them into his belt, 
Kagen threw a quick, casual wave 
to Ragelli, then hurried up the 
ramp. It lifted slowly behind him. 

Inside the ship, a crewman 
greeted him with a curt nod. “Got 
special quarters prepared for 
you,” he said. “Follow me. Trip 
should only take about fifteen min- 
utes. Then we’ll transfer you to a 
starship for the Earth trip.” 

Kagen nodded and followed the 
man to his quarters. They turned 
out to be a plain, empty room, re- 
inforced with duralloy plates. A 
viewscreen covered one wall. An 
acceleration couch faced it. 

Alone, Kagen sprawled out on 



the acceleration couch, clipping 
his helmet to a holder on the side. 
Tractor beams pressed down 
gently, holding him firmly in place 
for the liftoff. 

A few minutes later a dull roar 
came from deep within the ship and 
Kagen felt several gravities press 
down upon him as the shuttlecraft 
took off. The viewscreen, suddenly 
coming to life, showed the planet 
dwindling below. 

The viewer blinked off when they 
reached orbit. Kagen started to sit 
up but found he still could not 
move. The tractor beams held him 
pinned to the couch. 

He frowned. There was no need 
for him to stay in the couch once 
the craft was in orbit. Some idiot 
had forgotten to release him. 

“Hey,” he shouted, figuring 
there would be a com box some- 
where in the room. “These tractors 
are still on. Loosen the damned 
things so I can move a little.” 

No one answered. 

He strained against the beams. 
Their pressure seemed to increase. 
The blasted things were starting to 
pinch a little, he thought. Now 
those morons were turning the 
knob the wrong way. 

He cursed under his breath. 
“No,” he shouted. “Now the 
tractors are getting heavier. You're 
adjusting them the wrong way.” 

But the pressure continued to 
climb and he felt more beams lock- 
ing on him, until they covered his 
body like an invisible blanket. The 



128 



GALAXY 




damn things were really starting to 
hurt now. 

“You idiots,” he yelled. “You 
morons. Cut it out, you bastards.” 
With a surge of anger he strained 
against the beams, cursing. But 
even Wellington-bred muscle Was 
no match for tractors. He was held 
tightly to the couch. 

One of the beams was trained on 
his chest pocket. Its pressure was 
driving his Stellar Cross painfully 
into his skin. The sharp edge of the 
polished medal had already sliced 
through the uniform and he could 
see a red stain spreading slowly 
through the white. 

The pressure continued to 
mount and Kagen writhed in pain, 
squirming against his invisible 
shackles. It did no good. The pres- 
sure still went higher and more and 
more beams came on. 

“Cut it out!” he screeched. “You 
bastards. I’ll rip you apart when 1 
get out of here. You’re killing me, 
dammit!” 

He heard the sharp snap of a 
bone suddenly breaking under the 
strain. Kagen felt a stab of intense 
pain in his right wrist. An instant 
later there was another snap. 

“Cut it out!” he cried, his voice 
shrill with pain. “You’re killing 
me. Damn you, you’re killing me!” 

And suddenly he realized he was 
right. 

G RADY looked up with a scowl 
at the aide who entered the 
office. 



“Yes? What is it?” 

The aide, a young Earther in 
training for high officer rank, 
saluted briskly. “We just got the 
report from the shuttlecraft, sir. 
It’s all over. They want to know 
what to do with the body.” 

“Space it,” Grady replied. 
“Good as anything.” A thin smile 
flickered across his face and he 
shook his head. “Too bad. Kagen 
was a good man in combat but his 
pysch training must have slipped 
somewhere. We should send a 
strong note back to his barracks 
conditioner. Though it’s funny it 
didn’t show up until now.” 

He shook his head again. 
“Earth,” he said. “For a moment 
he even had me wondering if it was 
possible. But when I tested him 
with my laser, I knew. No way, no 
way.” He shuddered a little. “As if 
we’d ever let a War Worlder loose 
on Earth.” Then he turned back to 
his paperwork. 

As the aide turned to leave, 
Grady looked up again. 

“One other thing,” he said. 
“Don’t forget to send that PR re-

And forward his medals to Well-

The aide nodded and Grady re- 
turned to his work. He still looked 
quite bored. ★

«UROGS, Tor God’s sake!” 

* Wexler yelled. “You mean 
this is it?” 

Alex Crawford suppressed a 
sigh as he looked up into the red, 
ill-tempered face. 

“Not exactly frogs,” he said. 
“Humanoid amphibians." 

Wexler turned back to the ob- 
servation window that ran the 
entire length of the lounge. The 
station perched on a hill over- 
looking the lakeside village with 
its reed huts. It was early after- 
noon and several young males 
were gamboling happily in the 
water near a diving board Craw- 
ford had erected. 

“They still look like frogs to 
me,” Wexler said sourly. “Man- 
sized maybe, but frogs. The bro- 
chure said people.” 

“They are people,” Crawford 
said. “With a near-human intel- 
ligence and a culture of their own. 
I’ve been studying them for nearly 
five years now and in a lot of ways 
they’re more civilized than hu- 
man beings. Crime and violence 
are completely unknown to them. 
They have a sense of community, 
while at the same time they pre- 
serve the integrity of the indi- 
vidual-^’ 

He stopped talking as he recog- 
nized the contempt in Wexler’s 
bulging, contact-lensed eyes. 

“You some kind of alien-lover? 
Things like that have culture? 
Melanie and me are supposed to 
be on vacation. What do we do 



here? Isn't there anyone else 
around — other humans, I mean?” 

“No, I'm alone here,” said 
Crawford. “But the station is well 
equipped. Just name anything 
you want. — food, drink, music.” 

Crawford was a slightly built 
man of below average height, 
with thinning sandy hair and a 
long-nosed, sensitive face that 
gave him the look of an intelli- 
gent mouse. He loved the peace 
and tranquility of Poligoy’s lakes 
and forests. The thought of his ever 
returning to Earth with its teem- 
ing, frantic millions was a night- 
mare that jerked him awake sweat- 
ing in the early morning hours. 

It was strange how despite the 
advent of matter transmission 
which had enabled the human race 
to spread throughout the galaxies, 
Earth still maintained its popula- 
tion at the impossibly high twenty- 
first century level because of the 
inborn chauvinism of man, who 
insisted on looking upon that bat- 
tered old planet as the center of the 
universe. Not so Alex Crawford, 
whose most fervent hope was that 
the corporation would allow him 
to stay on Poligoy when his con- 
tract was completed, to end his 
days in peace and blessed solitude, 
away from Earth and its multi- 
plicity of Wexlers. 

“The whole three of us? Big 
deal!” said Wexler. And then 
hopefully: “There’s some hunt- 
ing, maybe?” 

“No projectile or energy weap-

ons are allowed on a planet of this 
classification. But there’s always 
spear-fishing, if you’re any good 
at skin-diving.” 

“With my sinuses? You gotta be 
kidding.” 

“In that case, why not just relax 
and take it easy?” 

“Relax, hell. 1 told you, we’re on 
vacation. We’re supposed to be 
enjoying ourselves two hundred 
and fifty credits’ worth a day 
each-*and if we don’t that cor- 
poration of yours had better get 
itself a good lawyer. In the bro- 
chure it distinctly said there would 
be people here and plenty to do — ” 
Wexler squinted in an effort at re- 
call. “1 remember reading some- 
thing about 'the laughing, happy 
brown folk of Aruman IV wel- 
come Earth visitors to their para- 
dise planet, opening their hearts 
and homes.’ And there was this pic- 
ture of a broad with boobs like — ” 

ELANIE WEXLER entered 
the lounge at that moment and 
Crawford never got to hear the 
second half of the simile, or for 
that matter to -telling Wexler 
that he was on Poligoy — not Aru- 
man IV. Even if he had intended 
to do so, the reappearance of 
Melanie, who had retired to the 
washroom immediately on ar- 
rival, would have pushed the idea 
right out of his mind. 

From the first moment Melanie 
Wexler had materialized on the re- 
ceiving grid he had felt himself 



drowning happily in the depths of 
those wide blue eyes. By any stan- 
dards Melanie Wexler was a dish, 
a doll, a cracker. Slightly shorter 
than himself, she had a perfect 
figure and a gorgeously piquant 
little face framed by blond hair 
that hung down over her shoulders 
in carefully cultivated dis- 
array — and a way of looking at a 
man that made him feel three 
meters tall and muscular with it. 

“Well, now, that feels so much 
better,” said Melanie, treating 
Crawford to a dazzling smile that 
upped his blood pressure several 
points, then turning her attention 
to her husband. “Is something 
wrong, Harry?” 

“We've been conned, is all,” 
growled Wexler, pointing to the 
observation window. “Take a 
look at this paradise planet.” 

Melanie walked to the window. 
Crawford blushed deeply as he 
watched her hip movement and 
thanked whatever gods had charge 
of such matters that neither of the 
Wexlers was telepathic. 

“Harry, you do complain so. It 
looks very nice to me. All that blue 
water.” She clapped her hands. 
“And just look at that cute little 
native village!” 

“Bug-infested firetrap!” snorted 
Wexler. 

“That’s not strictly true,” Craw- 
ford said defensively. “Although 
1 must admit that a number of the 
indigenous insects can be trouble- 
some. On the other hand, you 




132 



GALAXY 




might be lucky enough to be bitten 
by a Varyl fly.” 

“Lucky?” 

“Yes, it’s something like an 
Earth mosquito, but it pays off for 
the blood it takes from its victims 
by injecting a venom which works 
on human beings as a euphoric 
hallucinogen.” 

Melanie Wexler uttered a little 
squeal. “How horrible! I just can't 
stand insects. And the idea of 
being bitten- ” 

“Please, there’s nothing at all for 
you to worry about,” Crawford 
said gallantly. “I can let you have 
some PC Ninety-seven tablets. If 
you take them you won’t be 
bothered at all. They modify the 
chemical structure of human 
perspiration, making it repel- 
lent to most of the local insects.” 

“You mean they’ll make me 
smell?" Melanie was already sur- 
rounded by an aura of expensive 
perfume with the strength of a 
force field. 

“Only to the bugs,” Crawford 
explained. “The change would be 
undetectable by another human 
being.” 

“I’ve got the feeling that this 
place is going to be no fun at all,” 
said Wexler. “Why don't we just 
ship out of here right now?” 

“I’m afraid that isn’t possible,” 
Crawford said. “Safety regula- 
tions forbid more than one trans- 
mat exposure in twenty-four 
Earth Standard hours per per- 
son.” He could have added that in 



their case the regulation was par- 
ticularly applicable, but there was 
no sense in alarming them at this 
stage by bringing up the subject 
of Scrambling. 

“You mean we’re stuck here for 
a whole day, whether we like it or 
not?” said Wexler. 

“If you’d only give it a chance. 
I’m sure you’d find a great deal to 
interest you,” said Crawford. 

“Yeah?” Wexler remained un- 
convinced. “What do you do 
around here for laughs? We just 
came in from Beldar IV, and 
that’s a tough act to follow. 
They’ve got a World War going 
there, you know, the full Flanders 
nineteen-eighteen bit.” 

“Harry went over the battlefield 
every day in an aircar,” said 
Melanie. 

“Well, you’ve got to pitch into 
that kind of thing if you’re going 
to get the maximum experi- 
ence,” Wexler said, with a touch of 
pride, as if louring in a light- 
shielded, force-field protected air- 
car were the height of heroism. 
“Melanie just couldn't take all that 
blood and mud. She went on the 
alternative excursions, hospitals, 
welfare projects, that kind of 
woman's stuff.” 

C RAWFORD was relieved to 
hear that Melanie Wexler did 
not share her husband’s ghoulish 
taste in entertainment. 

“There was this convalescent 
home for officers. None of them 



SCRAMBLE 



133 




badly disfigured, you understand. 
Such handsome, brave boys,” 
Melanie said reminiscently. “So 
human in their needs.” 

Crawford pictured her, a lovely 
figure in white gliding through 
the wards, dispensing comfort 
and encouragement, occasionally 
placing a cool hand on a fevered 
brow. The vision faded abruptly 
under the impact of Harry Wex- 
ler’s voice. 

“1 said, what have you got to of- 
fer us that will compare with 
Beldar IV?” 

“Certainly nothing on that 
scale,” admitted Crawford. “Life 
here is usually pretty quiet, apart 
from the spawning ceremonies in 
early spring — and you’ve missed 
the last of those by nearly three 
weeks.” 

“Hell. Now what kind of organi- 
zation is that?” Wexler 
complained. “Mel and I have 
always been kinda interested in 
quaint fertility rites.” 

“Strictly from an anthropologi- 
cal point of view, you understand, 
Mr. — ” added his wife, with a 
flicker of eyelashes that did things 
to Crawford’s hormone balance. 

“Crawford — Alex Crawford.” 
She was not only beautiful, 
thought Crawford, she had an 
intellect as well. All this wasted on 
her overweight, stupid slob of a 
husband. “I’m afraid I have to do a 
few maintenance jobs right 
now — just routine, you under- 
stand. Please help yourselves to 



anything you want from the bar. I 
should be back in about a half- 
hour — ” Babbling his excuses, 
face flushed with embarrassment 
at the thoughts that exploded into 
existence under the catalytic in- 
fluence of Melanie Wexler’s 
smile, Crawford made an awk- 
ward, stumbling exit through a 
door marked: Station Personnel 
Only. 

Once in the safety of his own 
small office, he sat down at his 
desk and began an attempt to con- 
sider the multiple problems pre- 
sented by the arrival of the Wex- 
lers. So far neither of them was 
aware that this was Poligoy and 
not their expected destination of 
Aruman IV, and if Crawford were 
careful he might be able to pre- 
serve this ignorance until he was 
able to ship them on to their next 
destination on the following day. 

But the situation was not quite as 
simple as that. The first question 
that had to be answered was how 
they had come to arrive at Poligoy 
in the first place. The reason could 
have been a human error back at 
the Beldar IV station, an error in 
the selection of the destination 
coding such things did happen oc- 
casionally. 

Or, if not a human error, a 
minor equipment failure, perhaps? 
Or... 

Crawford reluctantly faced the 
third alternative at last. Perhaps 
he had a Scramble on his hands. If 
that were the case the situation 



134 



GALAXY 




would be infinitely more serious. 
Scrambles were mercifully rare — 
although not quite as rare as the 
carefully arranged statistics ap- 
peared to show. In five years as a 
station operator he had not yet 
been involved in a Scramble situa- 
tion, though it was quite possible 
that the law of averages had 
caught up with him at last. Craw- 
ford sighed deeply, the vision of 
Melanie Wexler’s eyes, so trust- 
ing, so beautiful, rising in his 
memory as he opened the desk 
drawer and took out the red- 
covered book with gold lettering 
on its cover: Trans-universal 
Galactours Manual for Station 
Chiefs ■- Top Secret. 

It took him only a few seconds to 
find the section headed Scramble. 

Scramble is a blanket term 
used to cover a number of dif- 
ferent malfunctions in the pro- 
cess of matter transmission. 
Among thpse so included are: 

(A) Dead on arrival. 

(B) Disappearance — failure 
to arrive at destination. 

(C) Misplacement of organs 
or limbs. 

(D) Brain damage— insanity 
in one form or another. 

(E) Image reversal — subject 
received in mirror image 
of original. 

(F) Multiple ectyping™- with 
or without loss of origi- 
nal. 

The above list is provided 



merely as a guide and makes no 
pretensions toward being com- 
plete. These are the commoner 
manifestations, some of which 
may appear in combination with 
each other. It is therefore rec- 
ommended that in all cases 
where Scrambling is suspected 
the Station Chief should imme- 
diately get in touch with his 
Area Inspector. However, 
should this not be possible, the 
Station Chief is urged not to 
panic but to use his discretion 
until such time as contact can 
be made. He may do this in the 
confidence that his decisions will 
at all times be backed by the 
Corporation. 

Crawford sometimes found him- 
self wondering just how much 
that word “discretion” covered. 
He had an .idea that it was some- 
how connected with the presence 
of the laser pistol which he had 
found in the bottom drawer of his 
desk when he took over the sta- 
tion. The weapon was not shown 
in the inventory as part of the of- 
ficial equipment and its presence 
on Poligoy was strictly illegal. But 
when he had mentioned the mat- 
ter to Kranosky, the area inspec- 
tor, he had received an enigmati- 
cally oblique reply. 

“I run a clean territory, Craw- 
ford, and I shall expect you to help 
me keep it that way, check? Not 
one of my stations has ever cost 
the corporation a single credit in 



SCRAAABLE 



135 




refunds, law suits, or out-of-court 
settlements. Remember that and 
we’ll get along fine. Check? Any 
time you’re in doubt, just shove a 
tape down the beam to my office 
and I'll be right along to back you 
up. Check?” 

A passenger Scrambled in 
transit became a considerable 
liability to the corporation, capable 
of bringing a crippling law suit. 
There was little doubt that from a 
practical point of view a complete 
disappearance was • much more 
favorable to the interests of the 
corporation than a maimed reap- 
pearance, especially because in 
such a case they would be able to 
plead an old act-of-God escape 
clause which absolved them from 
responsibility. There was no posi- 
tive reference to any such prac- 
tices even in the Top Secret man- 
ual, but Crawford had an uneasy 
suspicion that in such a situation a 
loyal station chief was expected to 
use that undefined “discretion” by 
taking direct action which would 
save the corporation the expense 
and embarrassment of litigation. 



H E THRUST these unpleasant 
thoughts to the back of his 
mind. Such measures would surely 
not be necessary to deal with the 
situation he found himself in at the 
moment. The arrival of the Wex- 
lers must be due to an operational 
error on Beldar, nothing more. 
Kranosky, a disconcertingly ener- 



getic man, built like a barrel with 
legs, would be able to clear the 
whole thing up in a few minutes. 
He switched on the desk recorder 
and began to make a taped report. 

When the fecording was com- 
pleted he removed the cassette 
from the machine and hurried 
through into the transmat room. 
Placing the tape on the transmis- 
sion grid, he turned his attention 
to the control console — and 
noticed for the first time the single 
word that appeared on the two 
monitor screens: 

OYHRl.OAD OVERLOAD 

The duplicated message hadn't 
registered before, perhaps be- 
cause he had been too preoccupied 
with the sensation of falling into 
Melanie Wexler’s wide blue 
eyes— but now as he stared dry- 
mouthed at the ominous red cap- 
itals the full seriousness of his 
position began to dawn on him at 
last. There could no longer be any 
doubt that he was faced with a 
Scramble situation. Any mal- 
function serious enough to trip the 
overload cutouts on the transmat 
clearly came into that category. 

There could now be no question 
of getting the taped message 
through to Kranosky either — it 
could not be sent to area head- 
quarters until the transmat was 
working again. And — the Manual 
was quite specific on this point — a 
station chief was forbidden to 



136 



GALAXY 




interfere with the internal com- 
plexities of the transmat in his 
charge. A Model A 120 Matter 
Transceiver cost somewhere in 
the region of five million Cr. 
Earth, and there was no sense in 
allowing someone who was 
merely trained as an operator to 
fool around with a capital invest- 
ment of that magnitude. This was 
a job for maintenance and all he 
could do at the moment was to 
activate the automatic sub- 
etheric beacon and wait for the 
arrival of the engineers. He had no 
way of knowing just how long this 
would take. Although subetheric 
was quasi-instantaneous like the 
transmat beam, the maintenance 
crew had to travel by old-fash- 
ioned spaceship. 

During that time Crawford 
would be stuck with the Wexlers. 
He had no objection to spending 
a week in the company of Melanie 
but her husband was a very dif- 
ferent matter. Crawford squared 
his narrow shoulders and made his 
way back through to the tourist 
section of the station. 

W EXLER was in the lounge. He 
had obviously taken Craw- 
ford’s invitation to sample the 
pleasures of the well-stocked bar 
literally, but the intake of al- 
cohol had done nothing to im- 
prove his disposition. 

“You seen that goddammed wife 
of mine anywhere, Croydon?” he 
demanded. 



“CrawTord.” 

“Crawford — schmawford, I ask 
you a question, you give me the 
answer,” growled the big man, 
swaying precariously on the bar 
stool. 

“I’m afraid I haven’t seen the 
lady,” said Crawford. 

“You sure?" Wexler’s bloodshot 
eyes scanned him suspiciously. 

“I have been fully occupied with 
my duties,” Crawford said. “The 
last time 1 saw Mrs. Wexler she 
was in here with you.” 

“Yeah? Well, she’s not here now, 
is she?” 

“Perhaps she’s in her room,” 
Crawford suggested. “Would you 
like me to check?” 

“You keep outta my wife’s 
room,” said Wexler. He looked 
down into his almost empty glass 
and muttered morosely to him- 
self, “Same damned thing every 
place we go — " 

“Can I fix you another drink, 
Mr. Wexler?” Crawford said, 
searching for some way of reach- 
ing some reasonably amicable 
conversational level. 

“You trying to get me stoned?” 

“Not at all, Mr. Wexler. It’s my 
job to entertain the guests and 
make sure they have everything 
they want.” 

“Yeah? Well at two hundred and 
fifty skins a day I suppose that fig- 
ures,” Wexler said. “But I still 
think that brochure is a con.” 

Crawford swallowed. “I wanted 
to talk to you about that,” he said. 



SCRAMBLE 



137 




After all, he had to start his 
explanation somewhere. 

“You mean you admit it?" 

“No, Mr. Wexler, the brochure 
is perfectly accurate. The cor- 
poration is most careful that 
there should be no misrepresenta- 
tion. After all, our best advertise- 
ment is a satisfied client.” 

“Don't give me the old public 
relations routine, Pulford,’’ 
growled Wexler. “I've been in busi- 
ness myself all my life. Now 
what’s bugging you?" 

“Well, the fact is that there has 
been a slight error,” Crawford 
said. “Nothing at all to worry 
about, you understand but for 
certain technical reasons which I 
won’t bother you with at the 
moment, you have arrived on 
Poligoy — not Aruman IV, as was 
originally intended." 

“You mean we’re on the wrong 
planet?” exploded Wexler. “I knew 
those blasted frogs weren’t right!” 
“So you see the brochure — ” 

“To hell with the brochure!” 
shouted Wexler. “What about my 
two hundred and fifty a day?” 

“I can guarantee that the 
corporation will meet you on the 
financial arrangements,” said 
Crawford, hoping that his discre- 
tionary powers covered the mak- 
ing of such promises. 

“Yeah? Well that’s all very fine. 
But the way 1 see it there’s been a 
breach of contract here,” said 
Wexler. “The booking form dis- 
tinctly says ‘see up to ten planets of 



your choice ’ and I didn't choose 
this dump." 

“Quite so. Mr. Wexler, but I 
think you’ll find that undertaking 
is qualified by a contingent li- 
ability clause to cover unavoid- 
able changes in local conditions 

“Don’t you start quoting the 
small print at me, Pulford!" roared 
Wexler. “You and your damned 
corporation have robbed me of 
twenty-four hours' vacation time. 
I could have been enjoying my- 
self on Aruman IV. Nobody does 
that kind of thing to Harry Wex- 
ler and gets away with it." 

“That’s another thing,” said 
Crawford, deciding that he might 
as well let Wexler have all the bad 
news at one time. “I’m afraid that 
it looks as though you won’t be 
able to continue your tour tomor- 
row, after all. The station trans- 
mat is temporarily out of commis- 
sion.” 

“Temporarily? How long is 
that?” 

Crawford shrugged. “If there’s a 
maintenance crew in the area, a 
few days maybe. It’s impossible 
to be definite at this stage.” 

“Shall I tell you something, little 
man?” Wexler’s voice moderated 
suddenly to a confidential tone. 
“If I’m not back behind my desk 
at Wexler Tools and Components, 
Inc., by nine-thirty next Monday 
morning, I shall sue, claiming a 
million credits for each day’s 
delay — and there isn’t any court on 
Earth that won’t grant a verdict in 



138 



GALAXY 




my favor.” He guffawed nastily. 

I F ONLY Kranosky were here, he 
could handle it, thought Craw- 
ford hopelessly. But Kranosky, 
most likely, was light-years away, 
blissfully unaware of the jeopardy 
that faced the record of his “clean 
territory.” 

“You can fix me that drink now, 
boy,” said Wexler, rendered ami- 
able by the anticipation of suc- 
cessful and highly profitable 
litigation. “And while you’re 
about it, why don’t you have one 
yourself? You look like you could 
use a stiffener.” 

Crawford mixed Wexler a Ba- 
cardi and Coke strong enough to 
fell an elephant and, although it 
was still only late afternoon, he 
broke his usual tradition by hav- 
ing a Scotch and water himself. 

“May as well be comfortable,” 
slurred Wexler, getting unsteadily 
off the bar stool and weaving his 
way toward one of the lounge’s 
armchairs, which accepted his 
subsiding bulk with a moan of 
protest. He raised his empty glass 
a moment later and looked owl- 
ishly at the station chief. “Hit me 
again. Crawfish.” 

Crawford *obeyed, finding some 
solace in the thought that one more 
must surely tip the already failing 
Wexler into a drunken stupor. He 
was ferrying the empty glass back 
to the bar counter when he hap- 
pened to glance out through the ob- 
servation window and see Melanie 



Wexler, a nymphlike vision in a 
diaphanous pink creation, stand- 
ing on the terrace outside. 

She was looking into the lounge, 
smiling as she waved one per- 
fectly shaped arm in an unmistak- 
ably beckoning gesture. Crawford 
did a “who me?” double-take, con- 
firmed with a look over his shoul- 
der that Wexler was facing in the 
opposite direction, than hurried 
out to join her. After all, she was 
just as much a paying guest as her 
husband, and there would be a 
great deal more pleasure for him- 
self in entertaining her. 

J UST how much pleasure was 
something he hadn’t anticipated 
even in his wildest dreams. He 
found that the beckoning depths of 
Melanie Wexler’s wide blue eyes 
meant every word they didn’t say. 

“Oh, Alex,” she sighed, smiling 
up at him as she afterward lay in 
his arms on the lawnlike grass of a 
clearing near the lake edge. 
"You’re all man. Why didn’t I 
meet you before?” 

Still dazed by the after-effects of 
passion, Crawford was unable to 
think of a sensible answer but this 
minor shortcoming passed un- 
noticed as Melanie continued with 
her monologue. 

“You have no idea what a 
terrible life I endure with that 
beast,” she said, moist lips trem- 
bling kissably. “He has no idea of 
how to treat a woman. Most of the 
time he ignores me — but when he’s 



SCRAMBLE 



139 




drunk he’s like a mad bull. My 
mother warned me about men like 
him. I never thought I’d find my- 
self married to one — ” A tiny sob 
shook the perfect body, and 
Crawford surrendered to a sud- 
den upsurge of protective zeal. 

“Oh, Alex — “ The sound of his 
name on her lips was like a 
heavenly choir welcoming him 
once more to paradise. 

When the madness finally 
retreated and he once more be- 
came aware of his surroundings 
he realized with a start that the sun 
had set and the stars were already 
peeping down out of a purple twi- 
light. Melanie was lying com- 
pletely relaxed, her face childlike 
in sleep. He woke her with a gentle 
kiss. 

“Melanie, it’s late,” he whis- 
pered urgently. “I ought to be get- 
ting back to the station.” 

“Not yet, Alex,” she pleaded. 

“But your husband,” he pro- 
tested,' already weakening. Her 
eyes were like dark pools in the 
dimness, drawing him down 
irresistibly. 

It was close to midnight when 
they finally arrived back at the sta- 
tion. The lights had come on auto- 
matically with dusk and they could 
see the empty lounge clearly 
through the observation window. 

“Your husband — ” Crawford 
said again. 

“Don’t worry, Alex,” Melanie 
said. “He’ll be in bed, sleeping it 
off. Nothing’s going to wake him 



and tomorrow he won’t remem- 
ber a thing that happened. Why 
don’t we go in and have a couple of 
drinks, then we can eat an inti- 
mate little supper, just the two of 
us. Maybe later you can show me 
your quarters.” 

Marveling at his good fortune, 
Crawford walked arm in arm with 
her into the lounge. 

“I’ll fix the drinks,” she said, 
moving toward the bar. “You sit 
down and take it easy, you 
gorgeous man.” 

“Gorgeous man, is it?” roared 
the unmistakable voice of 
Wexler. 

C RAWFORD whirled to see the 
big man, evidently still drunk, 
standing unsteadily in the doorway. 
Wexler’s right hand was holding 
the laser pistol Crawford had last 
seen in the bottom drawer of his 
desk. 

“Damn it, Mel — every place we 
go you gotta get yourself involved 
with some jerk,” complained 
Wexler. “This time I’m going to 
do something about it.” 

Rudely shaken from the rosy 
glow that remained of his idyll 
Crawford frantically searched his 
mind for some notion of what to 
do, his vision tunneled in on the 
deadly weapon. He had no experi- 
ence in this kind of situation — but 
if Wexler pressed the trigger he 
would not live to benefit from the 
present lesson. The only vaguely 
applicable piece of information 



140 



GALAXY 




he was able to dredge up was the 
advice given him during his train- 
ing about the use of an air of firm 
reasonableness when dealing with 
troublesome drunks or deranged 
persons. 

Fighting against the paralyzing 
fear that gripped him, he moved 
a couple of steps toward Wexler, 
intending to say something like: 
Now see here, Harry. You’ve got 
the wrong idea about this. Why 
don’t we talk things over sensibly 
like civilized men? 

Unfortunately, all that came out 
was a squeaky: “Now see here...” 
Then his parched throat seized up 
solid. 

“Harry, don’t do it!” screamed 
Melanie. “They’ll recondition you 
out of your mind — ” 

“Maybe, but it will be worth it,” 
Wexler said with drunken deter- 
mination. “I’ve had all of this kind 
of thing I can take.” 

Crawford watched as the deadly 
weapon moved slowly up until it 
was pointing at his chest. He 
closed his eyes. His body tensed 
awaiting a blast of energy that 
could not fail to kill him at this 
range. He waited for what seemed 
like an age^-but, as he was 
familiar in the fictional sense at 
least with the time-dilation effect 
experienced by people in his 
present circumstances, he saw no 
cause for hope until he heard 
Wexler’s voice again. 

“What the hell’s gone wrong 
with the lousy thing?” He 



opened his eyes. Wexler was 
pawing clumsily at the pistol, an 
expression of drunken puzzlement 
on his face. Crawford realized with 
a surge of hope that whatever gods 
watched over the destinies of sta- 
tion chiefs had decided to give him 
another chance to survive. But he 
would have to act quickly. It could 
be only a matter of seconds be- 
fore the befuddled Wexler dis- 
covered how to release the safety 
catch on the laser pistol. 

Crawford launched himself for- 
ward, grabbing for the hand that 
held the weapon. He was out- 
classed from the point of view of 
weight but he had the twin 
advantages of surprise and com- 
parative sobriety. Missing his 
aim, he gained a grip on Wexler’s 
forearm, at the same time kicking 
out with his right foot. The big man 
uttered a roar of pain and stag- 
gered to one side, losing his 
balance. With Crawford clinging, 
terrierlike, the two rolled to the 
floor of the lounge, struggling. 

The next few seconds passed in a 
desperate blur for Crawford. He 
was fighting on a reflex, animal 
level of his nature, which he had 
never plumbed before. Vaguely in 
the background, behind the grunts 
and thuds of the conflict, he was 
aware of the counterpoint of 
Melanie’s screams. 

Next he was aware of a sudden- 
ly overpowering smell of burn- 
ing flesh and the body of his oppo- 
nent, who happened to be on top

of him at the time, went limp. 
Crawford struggled out from un- 
der, his vision clearing gradual- 
ly. He saw a neatly cauterized 
hole about the size of a half-credit 
coin in the center of Wexler’s 
chest. Automatically, he bent 
down and plucked the laser pistol 
out of the nerveless fingers. 

Something swished past him. A 
moment later Melanie was 
kneeling beside the body, wide 
blue eyes staring up at him accus- 
ingly. 

“You killed him, you murder- 
ing swine!” she screamed. “What 
did you want to go and do that 
for?” 

“I didn’t want to. But he was try- 
ing to kill me, wasn’t he?” Craw- 
ford said reasonably. 

“You — who the hell are you?” 
she snarled, the doll-like lines of 
her face hardening. “I had a hun- 
dred like you, Jack, or whatever 
your lousy name is. But Harry was 
my husband !” 

Jack, or whatever your lousy 
name is .. 

Alex Crawford was a gentle 
man, and if he had not been in such 
a state of shock the thing could 
surely never have happened. 
Shock^and disillusionment as 
he recognized the enchanting Mel- 
anie at last for what she was. But 
the thing that really made him 
tighten his finger on the trigger 
was that name, Jack — the ubiquit- 
ous John of whom she had known a 
hundred. 



T HE beam burned a precisely cir- 
cular hole right through the cen- 
ter of her beautiful forehead. 
Luckily she fell forward, so he was 
not forced to look at the reproach 
of her dead face. Even so, he stood 
for a long time afterward, unable 
to move away from the two bod- 
ies, gripped in a nightmare of re- 
morse. 

But even remorse faded eventu- 
ally and he began to consider the 
future. If the maintenance crew 
arrived and found him here with 
the bodies of the two Wexlers the 
very least he could hope for would 
be a discharge. After all, a station 
chief who had developed the habit 
of killing paying guests could 
hardly be an asset to Trans-Uni- 
versal. At worst, there was always 
the possibility that he would have 
to face a murder charge. Either 
way, he would be forced to leave 
the comfortable solitude of 
Poligoy and return to an Earth he 
hated. 

The alternative — there had to be 
an alternative . After all, the 
Wexlers had never officially ar- 
rived on Poligoy. If he could get 
the transmat working again just 
long enough to send the two bodies 
out on an unfocused beam they 
would never be picked up by an- 
other receiver and would go on 
traveling in the form of dissem- 
inated energy particles for- 
ever, never to be reassembled. 
Ali evidence of the crime would 
thus be destroyed. The loss of the 



142 



GALAXY 




Wexlers would be recorded as a 
Category B malfunction and the 
corporation would certainly not 
wish to make too much of a fuss 
about such a disappearance. 

The problem was how to get the 
transmat working again. Surely 
it was impossible that a reason- 
ably intelligent person could 
have worked around transmats for 
so long without picking up at 
least some knowledge of bow they 
operated? His training had in- 
cluded nothing more technical 
than instruction on when to press 
the right buttons but he had 
gleaned a few hints from conver- 
sations with the maintenance 
crew during routine servicing. 
For one thing, he knew that the 
tolerance of the cutout circuit 
was set purposely low, so that 
normally it would be tripped by 
the overload before a serious 
Scramble situation had time to 
develop. Now if he could find 
some way of overriding the cut- 
out circuit, just for a few sec- 
onds . 

F OUR and a half sweating hours 
later the job was done to his sat- 
isfaction and the two bodies lay 
side by side on the transmission 
grid platform. 

Crawford took one last regret- 
ful look at Melanie, then pressed 
the button that sent full power 
surging through the transmat, 
which had been on standby since 
the overloading of the cutout. 



The two bodies disappeared with 
satisfying rapidity. His troubles 
were over. Now all that remained 
to be done was to switch the trans- 
mat back to standby and cover up 
the traces of his tampering. 

Why they made so much of the 
technicalities involved in servic- 
ing the transmats he could not un- 
derstand. After all, if a guy with 
only a minimum of mechanical 
aptitude and some common sense 
could . 

Crawford’s self-congratulatory 
monologue died abruptly as he 
turned away from the transmis- 
sion platform. He realized his 
mistake as soon as he saw what 
was happening, but it was al- 
ready far too late to do anything 
about it. 

Before attempting a transmis- 
sion he should first have cleared the 
transmat of the previous, un- 
completed program which had 
been resonating in its memory 
banks for over twelve hours. His 
failure to do so had allowed a feed- 
back circuit to develop, with one 
section picking up the unfocused 
beam transmitted by the other. 
And since the safety cutout was 
not in operation, it was deliver- 
ing .. 

Crawford watched the receiving 
grid platform in horror. The pile 
of inert flesh was already some 
three meters high and the multiple 
ectypes of the bodies of Melanie 
and Wexler were still materializ- 
ing two by two by two ... ★

CONCLUSION 

EXILED FROM 



144 





145 



WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE: World Government has quietly 
kidnaped and exiled — to an orbiting satellite — Earth’s leading sci- 
entists, whose work on genetics and astrophysics threatens world 
stability. The sentence of Lou Christopher, brilliant young com- 
puter technician — whose wizardy has made possible revolutionary 
breakthroughs at U.S. Genetics Institute — is, however, commuted 
through the machinations of a rebel element in the World Council 
of Ministers to a different kind of exile — on an uncharted island on 
Earth, where he is to coordinate continued, illegal scientific re- 
search. 

Lou arranges to have his girl friend, Bonnie Sterne, brought to 
the island. She arrives but treats him coldly. 



XIII 

T HERE are more than three hun- 
dred trillion cells in the human 
body. Counting ten cells per 
second, to count them all would 
take more than a million years. In 
each cell are forty-six chro- 
mosomes; under the microscope 
they look long and threadlike and 
they have often been described as 
“strings of beads.” Each “bead” is 
an individual gene. Altogether 
there are some forty thousand 
genes in any human cell. 

The zygote — the fertilized egg 
cell that develops into an embryo 
and within nine months into a 
baby — also contains about forty 
thousand genes. Half this number 
comes from each parent. Each indi- 
vidual gene is a complex molecu- 
lar factory built of deoxyibonucleic 
acid (DNA), ribonucleic acids 
(RNA) and proteins. All the physi- 
cal characteristics of the resulting 



baby are determined by the genes. 
Eye color, tooth structure, basic 
metabolic rate, chemical balance, 
size of brain, shape of nose — ev- 
erything is controlled by the genes 
in the zygote. 

Lou’s work seemed simple and 
straightforward to him. He was 
training Ramo, the computer, to 
look over the detailed structure of 
each gene in a zygote and compare 
it to the structure of a healthy, un- 
damaged gene. 

Ramo, being a computer, knew 
only what his human co-workers 
told him. But he had two 
advantages that no human pos- 
sessed. First, he had absolutely 
perfect memory. Once the “map” 
of a healthy gene had been stored 
in the microcosmic magnetic pat- 
terns of his memory bank, he 
would never forget it, never blur or 
warp it, never let any emotional 
conditions prevent him from 
seeing it exactly as it had been 



146 



GALAXY 




given to him. Second, Ramo could 
work at the speed of light— he 
could scan dozens of genes and 
spot the imperfections in their 
molecular structure in the time it 
took Lou to count to ten. 

Two weeks had passed since 
Bonnie had come to the island. She 
was still. as cold and distant as she 
had been the first day. She worked 
for Lou and she did her job well. 
She had had lunch with him most 
days and dinner a few times in the 
tiny overcrowded cafeteria that 
Marcus had put up near the lab 
complex. She had even mended a 
hole in his pants pocket. But she 
still acted more like a wary em- 
ployee than a friend. She seemed to 
like Anton Kori — sometimes even 
to prefer Kori’s company to Lou’s. 

I should have never made them 
bring her here. She'll never forgive 
me for it .. 

The phone beside Lou buzzed. 
He punched a button. Marcus’ un- 
tanned face appeared on the main 
viewscreen. 

“You wanted me?” he asked. 

“Yes,” Lou said. “Some of the 
biochemists have been asking me 
to help them program Ramo to 
handle their work. I don’t mind 
helping them, but it’s going to 
take time, and I thought you 
wanted me to plug ahead on the 
basic genetic mapping as fast as I 
can.” 

“The biochemists?” Marcus put 
on a worried frown. “Why do they 
need special programing?” 



“They’re working on drugs that 
effect the chemistry in the 
chromosomes.” 

Marcus' eyes widened but he 
quickly regained his self-control. 

He said, “You’re quite 
right- you shouldn’t be pulled off 
what you’re doing to help with 
that. Let some of the other 
programers help them.” ■ 

Lou said, “Fine.” 

Marcus snapped, “If you’re 
bothered again, refer those respon- 
sible to me.” 

“Okay. Thanks.” 

Marcus nodded and cut off the 
connection. Lou worked at the 
control desk the rest of the morn- 
ing, phoned Bonnie around noon. 

“I’m afraid 1 can’t go to lunch 
with you, Lou,” she said, un- 
smiling. “The girls and I are eating 
at our desks. We’ve got mountains 
of work to do.” 

H E ATE a lonely lunch, returned 
to Ramo. By six o’clock he was 
bone-tired — his back ached, his 
head throbbed, his eyes 
burned — but on the main view- 
screen Ramo was displaying a 
detailed molecular map of the 
molecular structure of a single 
gene. And part of the map — the 
area of the gene that was 
flawed — was outlined in red. 

Lou typed on the master input 
keyboard, GOOD WORK 
RAMO. PERFECT. 

THANK YOU, Ramo flashed 
on the viewscreen. 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



147 




The phone signaled. Lou wiped 
Ramo from the screen and Anton 
Kori’s lean angular face took form 
on it. Kori was grinning hugely. 

“Can you have dinner with me?” 
Kori asked. “1 have a lot to talk 
about, a lot to show you.” 

Lou said, “I’m kind of beat — ” 

“Oh?” Kori’s smile faded, but 
only a little. “Maybe Bonnie will 
join me — if you have no objection. 
I’ve got to show these pictures to 
someone.” 

“Bonnie?” Lou felt his nerves 
flash a warning. “Urn — look, An- 
ton — I’ll give Bonnie a call and 
we’ll both drop over to your place. 
Okay?” 

“Wonderful. Come to my lab. 
Next to the instrument repair 
shop.\Bonnie knows where it is.” 

I’ve got no right to be sore at 
her. 

Lou punched out Bonnie’s exten- 
sion. She was not in her room. He 
tried her office. 

Her face filled the screen and his 
anger melted. 

“Oh, hello, Lou. I was just leav- 
ing for dinner.” 

“Kori just called. He’s very ex- 
cited about something, wants us to 
eat with him. Can you make it?” 

“Sure.” Without a moment’s 
hesitation. 

Lou asked, “Would you have 
been so free if I had asked you to 
have dinner with me? Alone?” 

For an instant a frightened look 
flickered in her green eyes. “What 
do you mean, Lou?” 



“You’ve been seeing a lot of 
Kori, haven’t you?” 

“Lou, I’m a taxpaying citi- 
zen — or at least I was until I got 
hijacked — ” 

“So you are sore about my hav- 
ing you brought here.” 

“Of course I’m sore. Weren’t 
you sore when they dragged you 
away? Do you enjoy being in exile? 
Is this island any better than the 
satellite or wherever it is that the 
rest of the Institute people were 
sent?” 

“You don’t want to be around 
me, is that it?” 

She tried to smile. “Lou — what- 
ever we had going between us back 
at the Institute can’t be the same 
here. It just can’t.” 

“That’s the way you want it?” 
Her smile faded and she looked 
sad and lonely. “That’s the way it’s 
got to be, Lou.” 

“Yeah.” He took a deep breath. 
“Well, how about dinner? I told 
Kori we’d both be over.” 

“All right,” she said softly. “As 
long as we understand each other.” 
He nodded, his face frozen into a 
bitter mask. “I understand.” 

He left his office, walked around 
the computer building and picked 
up Bonnie. They strod across the 
lab complex in silence. Tree 
branches overhead filtered an un- 
believable sunset sky of pink, saf- 
fron and soft violet. Between the 
boles of the trees the sun showed 
huge and distended as it touched 
the watery horizon. 



148 



GALAXY 




I F BONNIE and Lou had little to 
say to each other, Anton Kori 
more than filled their silence. The 
moment they stepped through the 
door into his cluttered labora- 
tory/workroom, he started chat- 
tering. 

“It’s fantastic. You’ll never be- 
lieve it — it’s like something out of 
the cinema — ” 

He bustled around the big room, 
dragging a table loaded with com- 
plex electronic gear across the floor 
and positioning it near the door. 

“Lou, would you turn on the 
switch for the laser?” Kori pointed 
to the wall over his workbench. 
“No, not that one — the next 
one — on your left. Yes.” 

Lou flicked the switch. He saw 
nothing in the room that looked 
like a laser but heard a hum of elec- 
tric power. 

“Wait till you see this — Bonnie, 
the lights, please. Behind you.” 
Bonnie turned off the overhead 
lights. In the darkened room 
Kofi’s bony face became eerily lit 
by the glow of the equipment. 

“Now — just a minute while I use 
this old slide for focusing — 

Lou found a rolling chair and 
pushed it toward Bonnie. She sat, 
and he stood beside her, facing the 
slightly luminescent viewscreen at 
the far end of the room. A slide 
came on, some sort of graph, with 
colored curves weaving across it. 

“Now the focus,’’ Kori 
mumbled. The graph suddenly be- 
came three-dimensional. The 



curves seemed to stand in the 
middle of the room. Lou felt he 
could walk around them and look 
at them from the other side. 

“Okay, good.” Kori grew so 
excited that his English took on a 
decided Slavic edge. “Now we see 
what no man has ever seen be- 
fore — except me.” 

The room went totally dark for 
an instant — then it was filled with 
stars. Lou heard Bonnie gasp. He 
felt as if he were drifting in 
space looking at stars as far as the 
eye could reach— white, yellow, 
orange, red, blue — unblinking 
points of fire in the black depths of 
space. In the distance the nebulous 
haze of the Milky Way glowed 
softly. 

“Wide-angle view, looking aft,” 
Kori explained matter-of-factly. 
“That bright yellow star in the 
center is— -the sun.” 

“These are the tapes from the 
Starfarer?” Lou asked. 

“They are. It took the ship more 
than thirty years to reach the vicin- 
ity of Alpha Centauri. And it took 
more than four years just for the 
laser beam to carry this informa- 
tion back to us.” 

A moment of darkness and then 
another picture of stars. 

“Wide view forward,” Kori said. 
A bright yellow star still 
occupied the center of the field of 
view. Kori flicked through several 
more holograms. The yellow star 
grew brighter, closer. Presently it 
separated into two stars. 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



149 




“Alpha Centauri,” Kori said in 
an awed voice, as if anything 
louder might shatter the pictures. 
“Proxima is so distant and faint 
from its two big brothers that I 
haven’t yet been able to pinpoint 
it. It’s out among those back- 
ground stars someplace. We need 
an astronomer here.” 

Lou shared Kori’s awe. “Alpha 
Centauri,” he echoed. 

“You were right, Anton,” said 
Bonnie. “This is fantastic — and 
beautiful.” 

“Wait, “Kori answered. “You 
haven’t yet seen the best.” 

He flicked through another 
dozen holograms. The double star 
grew larger. One of the stars was 
smaller and redder than the big 
yellow sun. 

“What are those two flecks near 
the yellow star?” Lou asked. 

Kori laughed excitedly. “Flecks? 
Flecks indeed! Those are planets. 
Two planets orbiting around Al- 
pha Centauri — ” 

Lou had no words. He simply 
stared at the screen as Kori flicked 
on several more holograms, closer 
and closer, of the two worlds. On 
the very last slide only one planet 
was in view. Its yellowish green was 
streaked with white clouds. 

“I haven’t had a chance to 
analyze the spectroscopic data,” 
Kori said, “but those clouds look 
like water vapor to me. It’s a 
bigger planet than Earth, probably 
a heavier gravity. But if there’s 
water — there could be life!” 



T HE hour was late when Bonnie 
and Lou walked with Kori back 
to the dormitory. Kori stopped in 
the middle of the road at a spot 
where the trees didn’t overhang. 
He threw back his head. 

“Look at them,” he said. “Mil- 
lions and billions of stars. And 
millions and billions of planets. 
Some of them must be just like this 
Earth — and waiting for us. And 
we can. We can reach them and we 
will — ” He laughed loudly, swung 
his long arms up toward the sky 
and shattered the night with a 
shrill whistle. 

“Hey, easy — ” 

Kori yelled happily, “I’m drunk 
with joy and knowledge and power. 
We can reach out to new Earths. 
That’s enough to make any man 
drunk.” 

Lou shook his head in the moon- 
less dark. “Maybe we’ll need new 
Earths. We’ve certainly fouled up 
this one.” 

Kori laughed. He was in no 
mood for seriousness. “Wait until 
the people of the world see these 
pictures. Wait until they realize 
the meaning — ” 

“I thought the government 
wasn’t going to let the news out,” 
Bonnie said. 

“Marcus and Bernard will get 
the pictures out to the newsmen 
somehow. I’ll bet.” 

Her voice came quiet but firm. 
“Will they? Do you really think 
that they intend to let the world 
know about this? Or about the 



150 



GALAXY 




genetic engineering planned here?” 

Lou stopped and looked at her. 
In the darkness he couldn’t see the 
expression on her face. 

“What are you saying?” 

For a moment Bonnie didn't 
reply. Then: “I’m not sure — and I 
could be wrong. I’ve just got 
a — well, a feeling, sort of — ” 

“Go on — most hunches have a 
reason.” 

“Well — why do they have Anton 
working on nuclear explosives? 
What guarantees do we have that 
our work will be made public? Why 
are the biochemists working on 
cerebrocortical suppressors?” 

“Suppressors!” 

“Uh-huh. I just found out this 
afternoon,” Bonnie said. “That’s 
what they need the computer time 
for — to select the chemical sup- 
pressor that does the best job of 
degrading cortical activity — per- 
manently.” 

“Destroy the. subject’s intelli- 
gence?” 

“Yes. And I think they’re plan- 
ning to use Big George as a guinea 
Pig-” 

Lou felt a bomb go off in his 
guts. “No, they wouldn’t — if this is 
true—” 

“If it is — we’ve been tricked into 
working for a group of people 
who’re planning to overthrow the 
government and turn half the 
world’s people into mindless zom- 
bies.” 

The long silence was broken only 
by the night sounds of insects from 



the trees and brush and the distant 
sigh of the surf. 

Finally Kori’s voice came rue- 
fully: “Well, at least I don’t feel 
drunk any more.” 

XIV 

I T TOOK Lou nearly a week to 
convince himself that Bonnie was 
right. 

He used Ramo as his source of 
information and his teacher. He 
didn't know very much about the 
work the biochemists were doing. 
So he followed their progress by 
checking Ramo’s programs and 
memory bank every evening, after 
his own work was finished. Within 
his vast memory Ramo stored 
most of the world’s knowledge of 
biochemistry. So the computer 
became Lou’s teacher, and ex- 
plained patiently and with ma- 
chine-like thoroughness exactly 
what the island’s biochemists were 
trying to do. 

By the end of the week Lou knew 
enough. 

He sat on the warm beach sand, 
Bonnie on one side of him and Kori 
on the other. About two dozen 
people, most of them men and 
women from the technical staff, 
were on the beach or swimming in 
the gentle surf that rolled in from 
the reef. Far off on the horizon, 
huge towering cumulus clouds 
paraded like happy children across 
the sky. 

The three of them sat a little bit 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



151 




away from the rest of the bathers. 
Bonnie was still wet from a short 
swim. Her skin was glistening with 
droplets of water, and prickled 
from chill. Or was it fear, in this 
warm afternoon? Lou noted with a 
kind of abstract appreciation 
that plenty of her skin was to be 
seen. She wore the briefest of 
swimsuits. 

He kept his face serious and his 
voice low. 

“You were right, Bonnie,” he 
said. “The biochemists are work- 
ing on suppressors. They’ve al- 
ready produced test samples of a 
drug and have injected it into 
mice. Ramo showed me the test 
results. Six mice starved to death in 
mazes because they couldn’t find 
their way to the food at the end of 
the maze. Before they had been in- 
jected, the same mice had made it 
through the same mazes in less 
than a minute.” 

Bonnie shivered. 

Lou went on grimly: “And today 
they asked Ramo for the complete 
cortical layout on Big George. 
There’s no doubt about it — they’re 
going to try the drug on him.” 

“And then on a human being?” 
Lou glanced up at her face. He 
nodded. “Yeah, you’re right. That 
would be the next step.” 

“What do we do?” Kori won- 
dered aloud. 

Lou shrugged. “There are only 
two things I can think of. First, we 
can stop the work we’re do- 
ing — just refuse to do any more. 



That would slow ’em down some.” 
“But it wouldn’t stop this sup- 
pressor business at all,” Bonnie 
pointed out. 

“And they already have enough 
nuke bombs to destroy Mes- 
sina — if they want to,” Kori said. 

Lou nodded and traced a square 
in the sand with his finger. 
“Okay — the only other thing we 
cap do is wipe out Ramo.” 

“Blow up the computer?” Kori 
asked. 

“No — I can just erase all his 
programs and memory banks. 
Take a little time and some tinker- 
ing— but I could do it.” 

“It would take more than a little 
time,” Bonnie said. “Ramo’s 
banks — ” 

“I know a few tricks I haven’t 
shown you.” Lou grinned. “I 
could wipe Ramo clean in a night.” 
“Really? That would stop every- 
thing they’re doing,” Kori said. 
“They’d still have the bombs.” 
Shrugging, Kori said, “Yes, but 
as I told you, the bombs are small. 
Toys, really. Without the biologi- 
cal weapons they’re trying to 
develop, the bombs by themselves 
wouldn’t accomplish much.” 

Bonnie shook her head. “You’re 
forgetting something else that 
they’d still have.” 

“What?” 

“Us. ..or really you, Lou. If 
Ramo is wiped clean, don’t you 
think Marcus is smart enough to 
figure out who did it?” 

“Okay,” Lou said evenly. “So 



152 



GALAXY 




he’ll know I did it. What good does 
that do him? Ramo will still be 
blanked out. Marcus will be 
sttopped dead.” 

“And so will you be,” Bonnie 
said. “He’ll kill you.” 

“That wouldn’t do him any 
good.” 

“It wouldn't do you any good, 
either,” said Kori. 

“Don’t you see?" Bonnie said. 
“Killing you wouldn't help him, I 
admit. But I think he would do it. 
Doesn’t that stop you from erasing 
Ramo?” 

“It does take a lot of the fun out 
of the idea.” 

Kori said, “Wail — we've left 
something out of the equation. 
We’re all assuming that we must 
stay on this island.” 

“You know a way off?” Lou 
asked. 

“Well, there are boats every few 
days — •” 

“Can the three of us take over 
one of the boats? Can you navi- 
gate? Do any of us even know 
where this island is?” 

Dismal silence. 

Then Kori brightened again. “If 
we can’t get off the island, maybe 
we can signal someone to bring 
government troops here to rescue 
us.” 

“Okay, great idea. How are you 
going to signal?” 

“Well — there’s a radio station 
down by the harbor.” 

“Yeah, and three armed guards 
at the door all the time. And even if 



we could get in and operate the 
radio — and make contact with 
somebody — we’d be dead before 
any government people got to this 
island.” 

Kori clasped his hands behind 
his head and stretched out on the 
sand. “Louis, My friend, I am a 
physicist. I have come up with a 
great basic idea. I admit that there 
are a few details to be ironed out. 
That’s the work of engineers, not 
physicists.” 

He closed his eyes. 

L OU was unable to sleep that 
night.’ He lay in his narrow bed, 
peering into the darkness, listen- 
ing to the night sounds outside. 
The room’s only window was open 
to the sea breeze. A million 
thoughts kept crowding in on him. 
No matter how he turned or 
punched the pillow or forced his 
eyes shut or tried to relax, he still 
found himself awake in the rump- 
led bed, sticky with persperation, 
his eyes open and jaw clenched ach- 
ingly tight with tension. 

Finally he admitted defeat, got 
up and dressed. He walked out into 
the darkness, down the road 
toward the laboratory buildings. 
And the computer. 

He turned around the corner of 
the first lab building and headed 
toward Big George’s compound. 
A guard drowsed at the gate. The 
moon was riding in and out of 
scudding silvery clouds but trees 
inside the compound made every- 



EX1LED FROM EARTH

thing dark. Straining his eyes, Lou 
made out the bulky shape of the 
gorilla on a pallet of wood, straw 
and palm fronds. He heard a snuf- 
fle and the dark shape moved slug- 
gishly. 

“It’s okay,” Lou called softly. 
“It’s me, Georgy.” 

The gorilla rose, pulled himself 
off the pallet and shuffled to the 
fence. 

“Uncle Lou ” 

“How are you, Georgy?” 

“Good. I been very good." 

Lou wanted to reach out and pat 
him but the wire fence was too fine. 

“I know you’ve been good, 
Georgy. Do you like it here? Has 
everybody been nice to you?" 

“I have lots of room to play and 
they feed me good. But nobody 
comes to play with me. I’m all 
alone.” 

“I’m sorry. I haven’t been to see 
you as much as I should. 

“But the doctor said he’d come 
and play with me,” George whis- 
pered. 

“The doctor? What doctor?” 

“The doctor,” George answered. 
“He was here today^or was it 
yesterday? Do you call it today if 
it was the day before tonight?” 

“Never mind,” Lou said impa- 
tiently. “What doctor? Who was 
he?” 

“He’s a new friend. He said he’s 
going to play with me when he 
comes back again. And I didn’t 
move or yell or do anything — even 
when he hurt me.” 



“What did he do to you?” 

The gorilla touched the back of 
his head with a huge clumsy hand. 
“He made a funny noise back here 
and it hurt a little. But just a little. 
It feels all better now.” 

Spinal tap , Lou thought, his 
insides sinking. 

“I promised I wouldn’t move 
even if it hurt,” George said. 

“Georgy, listen. The doctor— -he 
said he’d be back. When? When’s 
he coming back?” 

“Tomorrow.” 

Tomorrow. This morning, most 
likely. “Okay, Georgy, you get 
back to sleep now. I’ll come and 
see you tomorrow.” 

“All right. Uncle Lou. Good 
night.” 

“Good night.” 

The gorilla shambled back 
toward his pallet and Lou began to 
know what real responsibility felt 
like. The only way he could save 
Big George would be to destroy 
Ramo. 

He almost laughed as he stood 
by the wire fence in the moonlight. 

Some family I've got -a gorilla 
and a computer. One of them is 
going to die. And it's up to me to 
choose which one. 

He hesitated only for a moment 
before he turned and headed for the 
computer building. 

XV 

T HE door to the computer build- 
ing was locked. Not by a voice- 



154 



EXILED FROM EARTH 




code lock but an old-fashioned 
mechanical type. A set of nine 
buttons had to be pushed in the 
right combination to open it. 

Lou did not know the combina- 
tion. 

And I'll bet Marcus has the 
building wired with alarms. No 
sense getting shot if you can't do 
the job you set out to do... 

Suddenly he smiled. 

On the other hand — if you're 
smart enough and quick enough 
there might be a way to get the job 
done without killing anybody... 

He walked back to the dorm- 
itory, undressed and got into bed. 
He set his wristwatch alarm for 
six, closed his eyes. 

He was asleep in five minutes. 

He had less than three hours of 
sleep when he stood by the fence of 
George’s compound again. 

“Here’s some fruit I saved from 
breakfast,” he said to the gorilla. 
“Catch—” 

He tossed a banana and two 
oranges over the fence. George 
backpedaled clumsily and man- 
aged to grab the banana in one 
huge hand. The oranges fell to the 
ground. 

He stooped to pick them up, 
then jammed all three into his 
mouth. 

“Thank you Uncle Lou,” Big 
George said juicily. 

Lou laughed. “You’re welcome, 
Georgy.” 

A guard was walking past the lab 
buildings. He stopped at each 



door to touch out a combination 
on the lock. Lou talked with the 
gorilla for a few minutes longer, 
then strode briskly to the com- 
puter building. The guard was out 
of sight. 

The rest of the technical staff 
was probably just getting up, Lou 
thought as he glanced at the con- 
trol panel clock. Sliding into the 
seat, he immediately started 
typing out instructions for Ramo. 

By mid-morning he found out his 
scheme was working. Despite the 
computer room’s nearly arctic air- 
conditioning he was sweating. 

The phone buzzed. The round 
oriental face of a biochemist 
appeared on the screen. He looked 
unhappy. 

“We seem to have a problem this 
morning,” he said without 
preamble. 

“Really?” 

“Yes. We went to run a routine 
check of yesterday’s work and 
found that the data we recorded 
yesterday is missing from the 
computer’s memory bank.” 

“Missing?” Lou shook his head. 
“Impossible. You’re probably just 
searching the wrong bank.” 

They talked it over for nearly a 
half-hour. The results of yester- 
day’s spinal tap on the gorilla, the 
cortical map, even some of the 
chemical formulas that had been 
stored in the computer weeks 
earlier — all were gone from 
Ramo’s memory banks. 

“I’ll do a complete check to find 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



155 




the missing data,” Lou said, “but 
it sounds to me like some of your 
people have goofed up. Running 
this computer isn’t as simple as 
operating a typewriter, you know. 
You should have let me record 
your data — or at least you ought to 
have a trained computer program- 
er or technician doing the job.” 

“They are trained technicians,” 
the biochemist snapped. 

Lou shrugged. “Then they 
haven’t been trained well enough. 
Okay, I’ll look for the data for you. 
But I’m willing to bet it was never 
stored properly in the first place.” 

The biochemist was starting to 
look furious. “Two months of 
work lost!” He lapsed into Chi- 
nese. 

It took them a week to figure out 
what was going on. Lou had known 
from the start that the discovery 
was inevitable, that he was racing 
against time. He would spend his 
days at his own work. At the end of 
the day he would have Ramo 
review the biochemists’ work for 
him. It took him only a few min- 
utes to erase some of the material 
from Ramo’s memory banks. Lou 
never washed out all of it — simply 
enough key data to void the rest. 

The biochemists became a very 
unhappy group of people. Their 
chief went around screaming and 
purple-faced. The computer tech- 
nicians who worked for them 
looked scared. By the end of the 
week Lou was spending most of 
his day with the technicians, try- 



ing to find out why they were un- 
able to do their jobs properly. 

At dinner with Bonnie and Kori 
in the noisy cafeteria Lou said to 
Kori, “You’ve got to figure out 
some way to get us off this island. 
It’s only a matter of time until the 
biochemists figure out what’s 
wrong with their computer pro- 
grams, and then...” 

“I know,” Kori answered, 
hunching over the table and speak- 
ing as low as possible, “I’ve been 
trying to work out a star fix to find 
out where we are. But I’m afraid 
the sextant I’ve built isn’t very 
accurate.” 

“But how do we get off the 
island?” Bonnie asked. 

Kori shrugged. “Maybe we 
could build a raft — ” 

“Or a flying carpet,” Lou said 
acidly. 

That ended the discussion. 

T HE next day an armed guard 
showed up at the computer con- 
trol room. He made directly for 
Lou. 

“What is it?” Lou asked, 
tensing. 

The guard said, a Malay lilt to 
his voice, “Mr. Marcus wishes to 
see you.” 

“I’m busy at the moment. Tell 
him-^*’ 

“Now,” the guard said. He 
hitched a thumb on the holster at 
his hip. 

Lou nodded. “Okay, just let 
me — ” 



156 



GALAXY 




“Do not touch the computer 
controls,” the guard said softly, 
even gently. But his hand curled 
around the butt of his gun. 

Lou found that his own hands 
were suddenly trembling and well 
away from the controls, 

“Okay, okay, but the com- 
puter’s in the middle of a run.” 
“Some other technicians are 
being brought in to take care of it. 
You will come with me, please.” 

A car was waiting outside. 
Another guard sat at the wheel. 
Lou climbed in and the first guard 
sat beside him. In a few minutes 
Lou was ushered into Marcus’ air- 
conditioned study, a small room, 
lined with books. A single large 
window overlooked the sea. 

Marcus was sitting at a desk in 
front of the window. A few 
straight-backed chairs were in the 
room, and a comfortable-look- 
ing sofa. Marcus was talking into 
the viewphone on his desk. With- 
out looking up he gestured Lou to 
a chair next to the desk. His face 
wore its usual calm expression. 

Marcus said quietly to the 
phonescreen, “We’ve tracked 
down the source of the trouble and 
we’ll get things back under control 
and on schedule.” 

Lou heard a voice reply, “Very 
well. See that you do. The timing 
is very critical.” 

“I understand. Goodbye.” 
“Goodbye.” 

Marcus disconnected, stared 
into the screen for some moments. 



then turned slowly to face Lou. 
“You surprise me,” he said. 

“I do?” 

Marcus almost smiled. “Let’s 
not play games, Christopher. 
You’ve been sabotaging our com- 
puter programs, slowing down 
our biochemistry project. Why?” 
“How did you settle on me as the 
villain?” 

“You’ve been fairly obvious— 
we should have caught on sooner.” 
Marcus leaned forward in his 
chair. “Now listen, Christopher. 
You’re not in the States any more. 
You’re playing in a different 
league — with different rules. I 
don’t have to prove you’ve been 
screwing up the computer. I think 
you have, and I’m going ahead on 
that assumption. I called you here 
to find out why you’re doing it and 
to tell you what’s going to happen 
if you don’t stop.” 

Lou felt anger rising up inside 
him. “Just like that, huh? 
Somebody’s messing up the com- 
puter and 1 get blamed. What hap- 
pens now? Firing squad?” 

“Nothing so dramatic,” Mar- 
cus answered. In a voice that 
sounded genuinely concerned, he 
said, “You know, I really think 
you’re more worried about that 
gorilla than about your own skin.” 
“Yeah. I’m a gorilla freak.” 
Shaking his head like a patient 
father, Marcus said, “All right, 
play it tough if you want to. But lis- 
ten to this and get it straight. We’re 
going to take over the world 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



157 




government. Never mind who ‘we’ 
consists of. Some people in our 
group are very important. We're 
playing for the highest stakes 
there are and we don't intend to let 
you or anyone else stand in our 
way.” 

“Is that why you've got Kori 
making bombs?” 

“Of course. Did you ever hear of 
a government that allowed itself 
to be pushed out of power without 
a fight? We’re developing three 
weapons here: nuclear bombs, the 
cortical suppressor and genetic 
engineering.” 

Lou said, “So you can blow up 
your enemies, turn the survivors 
into morons, and then - after 
you’ve taken over — control every- 
one’s children.” 

“That’s pretty close.” 

“It doesn’t sound like a very 
happy world that you’re aiming to 
set up.” 

“No? And what kind of world do 
we have now? The government’s 
letting the cities fester more and 
more. More and more barbarians 
are being born and are pushing out 
into the civilized parts of the world. 
How long do you think it’ll be 
before a plague of rats sweeps 
across the whole world? Two-leg- 
ged rats, from New York and Rio 
and Tokyo and Calcutta and 
Rome — every big city in the 
world?” 

“And your answer is to bomb 
them out or turn them into zom- 
bies.” 



“If we have to," Marcus said in 
the tone I: ; would use to offer a 
drink. “The bombs are really for 
fighting the government troops. 
Once we’ve taken over, we'll have 
other means of handling the bar- 
barians. 

Lou shook his head. 

“I wish I could get through to 
you,” Marcus insisted. “What’s 
this government done for you? Put 
you in exile -you and all your 
friends. When we take over, you 
can go back to living normal, use- 
ful lives.” 

“Useful to whom?” 

Marcus said with great earnest- 
ness, “Listen to reason, will you? 
You and the other scientists will 
be among the top people in the new 
society. Your children will get the 
best genetic care that you your- 
selves can provide.” 

“Until somebody decides he 
doesn’t like what we’re doing, or 
what we’re thinking,” Lou 
answered. “This government’s 
slapped us in exile. Your friends 
might not be as lenient.” 

M ARCUS sank back in his 
chair. “I don’t have the time to 
argue with you. We’re going ahead, 
and there’s nothing you can do to 
stop us. If you don’t stop tinkering 
with our biochemistry project 
you’re going to get hurt.” 

“Let’s discuss that,” Lou sug- 
gested. “You need me to make the 
genetic engineering a success, 
right? And that’s where the real 



158 



GALAXY 




jackpot is. You might be able to 
surprise the government and 
knock it off — you might be able to 
take over — but without genetic 
engineering, you’ll never be able 
to control Earth. The tip-off on 
how your minds work is the bio- 
chemistry project. You’re not 
planning on building a better 
world with better people on it. 
You’re planning to exploit and 
destroy.” 

Marcus shook his head. “You 
make us sound — ” 

“Rotten. Filthy and rotten. And 
that’s what you are. But you need 
me. I’m the key man — you told me 
so yourself.” 

“There are others — ” 

Lou shook his head. “You know 
better. Nobody — not even any one 
the exiled scientists — knows the 
complete picture as I do. And if 
you found someone who could be 
trained you’d lose at least a year, 
maybe two, bringing him to 
where I am now. I understand the 
whole genetic engineering prob- 
lem, and there’s plenty of it tucked 
away in my head, not in any com- 
puter banks or notebooks. Lose 
me and you lose that — permanent- 
ly” 

Marcus sighed wearily. 

He said, “You still don’t realize 
what you’re up against, do you? 
Why do you think we went to the 
trouble of finding that girl friend 
of yours and bringing her here? 
We don’t have to threaten you. If 
you’re worried about what we’re 



going to do to your precious 
gorilla, try to imagine what could 
happen to the girl. Things could 
get very unpleasant for her. Very 
unpleasant.” 

Lou gripped the arms of his 
chair hard enough to make his 
hands hurt.. He was fighting and 
instinct to spring at Marcus. 

“Just try to control yourself and 
do as you’re told,” Marcus said 
softly. “Behave — and everything 
will be fine for you. But keep work- 
ing against me and the girl will suf- 
fer for it.” 

“If you hurt her I’ll kill you.” 
Lou was surprised to hear the flat 
metallic ring in his own voice. 

Marcus did not change his ex- 
pression. “Christopher, we 
shouldn’t be threatening each oth- 
er. Just do your work and neither 
you nor anyone else will get hurt. 
That’s all we’re asking from you. 
As for the gorilla — it will proba- 
bly be happier at its natural intel- 
ligence level than it is now.” 

Lou stood up and started for the 
door. 

“Wait a minute,” Marcus called. 
“You haven’t said — ” 

Lou turned. “You’ve got all the 
answers you need. There’s no way 
for me to stop you.” 

Trembling with rage, he left the 
office, walked past the guard 
lounging outside the door, went 
out. He ignored the car still parked 
in front with its driver and walked 
back toward the dormitory. 

As he passed the lab complex, 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



159 




Kori came running up to him. 

“Lou, I’ve been looking for you 
everywhere — ” 

Lou said nothing. 

“I’ve figured it out,” Kori 
whispered excitedly. “How to get 
the government troops here. And 
quickly — inside a few days.” 

Lou shook his head. “It’ll be too 
late.” 

XVI 

K ORI grabbed his arm and 
stopped him. “I'm serious. We 
can do it.” 

Lou said, “In a few days they’ll 
have ruined Big George, maybe 
killed him. And if I try to stop 
them they’ll take it out on Bonnie.” 
“What?” 

“That’s what Marcus just told 
me. If he doesn’t like the way I 
behave — Bonnie’ll suffer for it.” 
“But he can’t — ” 

“Yes he can. And he will. I bet 
he’d even enjoy it.” 

Kori’s face turned as red as the 
setting sun. “That pudding-faced 
son — I’ll — ” 

Lou took Kori’s arm. “Hold on. 
There’s nothing we can do about 
it.” 

He felt Kori’s surge of anger 
fade away, saw his face return to 
normal, except for a sullen smold- 
ering in his eyes. 

“What do we do now?” Kori 
asked. 

“I don’t know,” said Lou. 
“What was your scheme all about? 



How can you signal for govern- 
ment troops?” 

“Oh that — with the navigation 
satellites.” 

“Navigation satellites? How?” 

“They have sensors on them to 
detect nuclear explosions.” 

“They what?” 

Kori started walking toward the 
dorm again. Lou trudged along. 

“It’s a holdover from the old 
days, before the world government 
disarmed all the nations,” Kori 
explained. “All the navigation 
satellites have a special array of 
sensors to watch out for nuclear 
explosions. If anybody sets off a 
bomb on the Earth’s surface, in 
the atmosphere — or even in 
space — the government is alerted 
instantly. In a few hours there’s an 
inspection team at the site of the 
explosion to find out what’s going 
on. An armed inspection team. 
With troops ready to follow at an 
instant’s notice.” 

“But nobody’s set off a bomb 
for — ” 

“I know. But the government 
still has the teams — they even hold 
practice drills. I was an advisor to 
a group of new recruits two years 
ago.” 

Lou swore. “Military tradition. 
Idiocy dies hard.” 

“Don’t complain,” Kori said. 
“Now then, the bombs I’ve been 
making are stored in caves at the 
far end of the island. If one of them 
went off and a satellite spotted the 
blast — we would have an in- 



160 



GALAXY 




spection team here in a matter of 
hours.” 

“Can you set them off?” 

“Them?” Kori laughed. “One 
will be enough. If they all go off 
they’ll wipe out this entire island. 
Do you know how much destruc- 
tive force even a single kiloton 
contains?” 

At the dormitory Lou sent Kori 
to bring Bonnie out. He didn’t 
want to explain matters to her in- 
side any building. All structures 
here might be bugged. When 
Bonnie came he briefed her quickly 
on his session with Marcus. Even 
outdoors he had the feeling that 
they were watched. In Marcus’ 
place, he himself would have 
guards out watching for trouble. 

A nd we’re going to make enough 
trouble to slide this island into the 
sea. 

They ate a quick, silent dinner in 
the cafeteria and then walked out 
to the beach. Walking ankle-deep 
through the warm-lapping waves, 
with the surf booming on the reef a 
kilometer out, they talked over 
their plans as the dying red sun 
stretched their shadows fantas- 
tically before them. 

“I’ll need at least two days to 
round up the proper equipment,” 
Kori was saying. 

“Make it one day,” Lou 
answered over the roar of the surf. 
“Big George doesn’t have two days 
to spare.” 

Kori glanced at Bonnie, then 
looked at Lou. “We want to do this 



right. If we rush, something 
might ...” 

“One day,” Lou said flatly. 

Shrugging, Kori agreed. “All 
right. One day.” 

“Where can we plant the bomb 
without setting off all the others?” 
Bonnie asked. 

“That’s why I wanted the extra 
day,” Kori said, “to find the best 
location. Probably the best thing 
to do is to bury it in the beach sand 
across the island from the storage 
caves. That ought to be safe 
enough.” 

“Will it make a big enough 
explosion for a satellite to see if 
you bury it?” Lou asked. 

Kori laughed. “Have no fear. A 
few feet of sand isn’t going to 
smother one of my toys.” 

“Okay.” 

“I’ll need two things,” Kori said, 
more seriously. “A car to carry 
equipment and a diversion to let 
me get into the storage cave and 
do what I must — without being 
stopped by the guards.” 

“What about the guards at the 
caves?” Lou asked. 

“There’s usually only one. I 
think I can handle him easily 
enough.” 

“You’re sure?” 

Kori drew himself up to full 
height. He towered several inches 
over Lou but he still looked 
spindly. “My friend, I was a 
national fencing champion five 
years ago. I still keep in good 
shape. Besides, I’m sneaky. I’ll 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



161 




ask the guard to help me carry 
some of the equipment and hit him 
when his hands are full and his 
back turned.” 

Laughing, Bonnie said, “My 
hero.” 

“Never mind,” Lou said. 
“Heroics are exactly what we 
don’t need. We need good, sneaky, 
practical action that works. I 
don’t want to win any moral vic- 
tory; we’ll all end up dead that 
way.” 

Kori nodded. 

“Okay,” Lou continued, “so you 
need a car and a diversion. We’ll 
figure that out — shouldn’t be. too 
tough a problem. But the big ques- 
tion is, how do we protect 
Bonnie?” 

“She’s got to disappear,” Kori 
said. 

“Great. How do we do it?” 

Silence. 

They walked slowly under the 
purpling sky. A surge of sea curled 
around their ankles, ebbed away. A 
lone gull glided low over the waves, 
calling sadly, as if looking for long- 
vanished friends. 

Finally Bonnie said, “Big 
George. I could stay in his com- 
pound for a day or so. There are 
plenty of trees and bushes to hide in 
and the guards never go in there.” 

“With the gorilla?” It was too 
dark to see Kori’s face but his voice 
sounded aghast. 

“We’re friends,” Bonnie said. 
“We’ve known each other since 
George was born.” 



“He wouldn’t hurt her,” Lou 
agreed. “Or anybody else, for that 
matter. Trouble is, he’d want you 
to play with him. You wouldn’t be 
able to stay hidden. He’d give you 
away.” 

“Not if 1 explained the game to 
him.” 

Kori shook his head. “I know 
you think a lot of that animal, and 
his intelligence has been boosted. 
But I wouldn’t plan to stay inside 
that fence with him for ten 
minutes — let alone twelve hours or 
more.” 

“Oh, you’ve seen too many 
movies,” Bonnie said. “George 
wouldn’t hurt anybody.” 

They went on talking, planning, 
arguing until stars filled the night. 

“Look up there,” Kori said. 

His shadowy outline pointed 
skyward. Looking up, Lou saw 
one star moving silently, purpose- 
fully through the heavens, as if it 
had detached itself from its nor- 
mal position to carry out some 
mission. 

“Is that one of the satellites?” 
Bonnie’s voice made a light, 
counterpoint against the basso 
background of the surf. 

Kori glanced at his luminescent 
wristwatch. “Yes. And right on 
schedule.” 

“Thank God,” said Lou. 

¥ OU didn’t sleep much that 
night, and the next day at the 
computer building he hardly paid 
any attention to his work. He went 



162 



GALAXY 




through the motions but his mind 
was racing, thinking about all that 
had to be done. 

Toward the end of the afternoon 
he could no longer stay cooped up 
in the control room. He stepped 
outside and took a deep breath of 
warm, salt-smelling air. 

The quiet afternoon was shat- 
tered by the tortured scream of an 
animal. A scream of rage and pain 
and fear. 

“George — ” 

XVII 

L OU ran to the gorilla’s com- 
pound. He got there in time to 
see two of the biochemists carry- 
ing a third through the gate. Big 
George was nowhere in sight. A 
half-dozen guards were clustered 
around the gate and more were 
arriving on the run, guns drawn. 
“What happened?” Lou shouted. 
They ignored him. A pair of 
guards took the unconscious bio- 
chemist from his co-workers. His 
face was bloody and one arm was 
hanging at a weird angle. 

Lou grabbed one of the sweat- 
ing scientists. 

“What happened? What did you 
do?” 

The little Oriental looked up at 
Lou with fear and anger in his eyes. 
In a nasal, heavily accented Eng- 
lish he said, “Ape became fright- 
ened by injections. Anesthetic 
wore off. Restraints not strong 
enough. Ape broke loose, knocked 



down Dr. Kusawa, ran back into 
trees.” 

“Injections?” Lou demanded. 
“The suppressors?” 

The biochemist nodded, pulled 
his arm out of Lou’s grasp and tot- 
tered away, following the guards 
who were carrying his boss. 

Lou went to the gate. 

One of the guards started shak- 
ing his head and motioning Lou 
away. “No. Danger. Keep away.” 
“Let me in there. He won’t hurt 
me. He is scared and hurt.” 

The guards were clustered 
around the gate, which was now 
firmly locked. Most of them were 
peering into the trees and brush. 
Big George was not in sight. The 
other guards were watching Lou. 

“Danger,” said the one guard to 
Lou. “Go away.” 

Slowly, reluctantly, Lou walked 
away. 

Outside, after dinner that night, 
Kori said, “Everything’s sud- 
denly different. Bonnie can’t stay 
with George now.” 

“Sure I can,” Bonnie said. 
“He’ll be all right by now and the 
guards will never dream of search- 
ing his compound. It’s a better 
hiding place than ever.” 

“No,” said Lou. “There’s no 
way of telling what those injec- 
tions did to him. It’s too risky.” 
Bonnie insisted that George was 
all right. “Let’s go down to his 
compound and talk to him.” 

Lou nodded agreement. Kori 
simply looked worried. 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



163 




They walked down to the 
gorilla’s compound but stayed 
away from the gate where the 
guards stood watch. They moved 
up onto the slope of the hill to a 
spot close to the trees inside the 
compound. 

“Georgy,” Lou called out softly. 
“Georgy, it’s me. Uncle Lou.” 

A snuffling grunt. From the 
shadows among the trees a pair of 
baleful eyes suddenly gleamed. 
Lou felt shaken. George’s eyes 
shone tonight like a jungle beast’s. 

He forced his voice to stay calm. 
“Georgy, it’s all right. It’s me, 
Uncle Lou. And Bonnie is here too. 
And another friend — ” 

A growl. 

Lou turned to Kori. “May be a 
good idea for you to go away, 
Anton. George must be scared out 
of his wits of strangers right now.” 
“He doesn’t sound scared.” 

“He is.” 

Kori said stubbornly, “But 1 
want to see the gorilla’s reactions 
for myself. 1 don’t want you two 
making any mistakes about 
this — ” 

“Shove it,” Lou- snapped, 
keeping his voice down to avoid 
frightening Big George. “You 
think you’re the only one with 
brains? I’m not going to let Bonnie 
take any chances.” 

“Stop arguing,” Bonnie said. To 
Kori she added: “He won’t come 
out as long as you’re here.” 

Kori left, muttering to himself. 
After another ten minutes of coax- 



ing and soothing big George 
lumbered out of the trees and to the 
fence. 

“Georgy,” Lou said, gripping 
the fine wire mesh of the fence. 
“Are you okay?” 

“Head — head hurts.” 

“It’s all right, Georgy,” Bonnie 
said. “The hurt will go away soon.” 
“Hurts — bad men — hurt — ” 

Is it just me or does his voice 
sound strange ? Like it's hard for 
him to put words together? 

“Georgy, don’t be afraid. It’s 
going to be all right. The bad men 
have gone away. They won’t come 
back.” 

The gorilla merely blinked. 
Bonnie said softly, “Georgy, in a 
little while I’m going to come and 
stay with you. I’ll bring you lots of 
food and some medicine to stop 
the hurt. 

“Hurt — scared — bad men — ” 
“I’ll stay with you,” Bonnie 
repeated. “And the medicine will 
stop the hurting. Don’t be afraid.” 
“And I’ll make sure that the bad 
men don’t ever come back,” Lou 
said, feeling anger welling up 
within him. “Not ever.” 

“Uncle Lou — ” Big George 
started but his voice trailed off and 
he never finished the thought. 

Lou said as gently as he could, 
“It’s all right, Georgy. No one’s 
ever going to hurt you again.” 

As they walked away from the 
compound, Bonnie put a hand on 
Lou’s arm. 

“You’re shaking,” she said. 



164 



GALAXY 




Nodding, Lou answered, “You 
know — last night I couldn’t sleep. I 
was scared. Still am, 1 guess. We 
could all get killed tonight. But I 
think what was really scaring me 
the most was the thought that I 
might have to kill somebody my- 
self. Or at least try to. But 
now— seeing what they’ve done to 
Georgy — to a harmless animal 
like that — I’m not shaking from 
fear. That’s anger.” 

“It’s all right,” Bonnie said. 
“Everything’s going to be fine.” 
“Do you really think you’ll be 
okay in there with George?” 

“Yes, of course. I’ll bring him 
some candy and sedatives. He’ll 
sleep like a baby.” 

Lou nodded. 

“You’ll see,” Bonnie said. “It’s 
all going to go like clockwork.” 
“Yeah.” Lou glanced at his 
wristwatch. 

X minus four hours and 
counting . 

E XACTLY at eleven o’clock the 
trio met at the dormitory door- 
way. They had spent the inter- 
vening hours checking final 
details, then pretending to go to 
their separate rooms for the night. 
Now they started wordlessly for 
the lab complex. They had found 
identical black stretch pullovers 
and slacks among the disposable 
clothing supplies in the dorm. 

There were two turbowagons on 
the island. One was usually parked 
for the night at the lab complex. 



The other stayed at Marcus’ house. 

“Do you think anybody’s watch- 
ing us?” Bonnie asked in a whisper 
as they walked along the side of the 
road toward the lab area, sticking 
to the shadows of the trees and 
shrubs. 

Kori whispered back, “They’ve 
got guards posted at the lab 
complex, the gorilla’s compound, 
the bomb storage caves and 
Marcus’ house. Why should they 
watch us? We can’t do any harm 
unless we get to one or more of 
those spots.” 

They skirted the lighted area 
around the complex by detouring 
through the trees, making a wide 
circle and doubling back to the far 
side of Big George’s compound. 
Kori stayed back. Lou and Bonnie 
walked up to the fence and softly 
called the gorilla. 

Big George lumbered up to the 
fence. “Hello Georgy,” said Lou. 
“How do you feel?” 

“Head — hurts — ” 

“I’ve brought some medicine to 
make it feel all better,” Bonnie 
said. “And some candy for you.” 
They talked for a few moments 
more with the gorilla. Then Lou 
boosted Bonnie to the top of the 
wire fence. George reached up and 
grasped her around the waist, his 
huge hands circling her com- 
pletely. He put her down inside the 
fence as gently as a ballet dancer 
handles his ballerina. 

Lou watched them, his sides sud- 
denly knotting as he realized how 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



165 




easily Big George could kill 
Bonnie. But she reached up and 
patted his massive head. As they 
turned and went toward the trees 
together Bonnie reached into the 
bag at her waist for some candy. 

Lou checked his watch. Eleven- 
thirty. He hurried back to Kori. 
Next step: get Kori his car. 

He met Kori, assured him that 
Bonnie was safe. They started 
back to the lab buildings. A lone 
guard patrolled slowly between 
the buildings. He looked bored 
and sleepy. But on his hip was a big 
pistol. 

Kori looked at Lou and nodded. 
He stepped out of the shadows and 
walked straight to the guard. 

“Say there,” he called out, “can 
you help me? I’m trying to get into 
my lab here — there’s some work I 
have to do — ” 

The guard was instantly alert. 
“All buildings locked. No one can 
enter until morning.” 

“Yes, I know but — ” 

Lou ducked around the back of 
the building, circled to come up 
behind the guard. Kori kept talk- 
ing intently and the guard was rest- 
ing his right hand lightly on the 
butt of the pistol. They were 
standing about ten meters from 
the corner of the building where 
Lou crouched. 

Ten meters. Quickly and quietly 
Lou slipped off his sandals. His 
bare feet on the gravel sounded 
deafening. The guard started to 
turn. 



Lou covered the last few meters 
with a flying leap and pinned the 
guard’s arms to his sides while Kori 
struck him across the windpipe. 
He gagged and went down, thrash- 
ing, with Lou on top of him. Kori 
calmly leaned over, pushed Lou’s 
face out of the way and chopped 
hard at the back of the guard’s 
neck. He went limp. 

Lou rose to his feet, sweaty, 
panting. “Is he dead?” 

“I doubt it,” Kori said. He went 
to the lab door and punched the 
buttons of the combination lock. 
The door opened and the lights 
went on automatically. 

“See?” said Kori smiling. “No 
alarms. I rigged them this after- 
noon — at the same time I changed 
the lock’s combination. There’s 
some benefit to being a physicist 
after all.” 



L OU dragged the guard inside, 
stuffed him into a cabinet, then 
locked it. Meanwhile Kori filled a 
tool kit with the equipment he 
wanted. 

They left the lab, relocked the 
door and walked to the car. 

“Are you sure you can handle 
everything by yourself?” Lou 
asked as Kori slid the tool kit on- 
to the back seat. 

“If you can keep them busy at 
the other end of the island,” Kori 
said. He pulled the guard’s pistol 
out of his belt. “Here. I’ll get 
another one from the guard at the 



166 



GALAXY 




storage caves. Do you know how to 
use it?” 

“I think so.” 

“It's simple. Just release this 
catch here and it’s ready to fire. 
Pull the trigger and it goes off. It 
should have at least a couple dozen 
charges in it. Laser pulse does as 
much damage as an explosive 
bullet — like hitting something 
with an ultrasonic hammer.” 

Lou nodded and iook the gun. It 
felt heavy in his hand. 

“Very good,” Kori said. “I’ll 
wait here until you start making 
noise down by the harbor.” 

“Right.” Lou tucked the gun 
into his waistband, saw Kori 
extend his hand. He took it and 
said, ’’Good luck.” 

Kori grinned. “See you tomor- 
row.” 

“Yeah.” 

Lou hurried through the starlit 
night down toward the harbor. 
The road passed Marcus’ house, 
where the only other car on the 
island was parked. Lou looked 
around, saw no one, slid in behind 
the wheel and released the brake. 
The car started to roll down the 
slight incline. 

He heard running footsteps be- 
hind him and a man’s voice: "Wei! 
Li tsai tsosheng mo?" 

Lou let the car glide to a stop, 
slid out and crouched down behind 
the car. A light came on at the 
front of the house. Two guards 
were standing in front of the place, 
staring at the car. Lou pulled out 



the gun and released the safety. 

The guards seemed unaware of 
him. They walked slowly toward 
the car. Lou stood straight up and 
fired over the car. Hundreds of 
joules of energy were suddenly 
changed to invisible pulses of 
infrared laser light. The first guard 
was bowled over backward, as if 
hit in the chest by a giant’s fist. The 
second spun and sprawled on his 
face. Neither moved once they hit 
the ground. 

His hands shaking, Lou again set 
the safety and tucked the gun into 
his waistband. Then he forced 
himself to go over to the bodies 
and take their guns. The men were 
still breathing. He felt a little bet- 
ter as he went back to the car and 
tossed their guns to the front seat. 

He got in behind the wheel 
again, turned on the car’s head- 
lights. A road ran down toward the 
harbor. It was time for Kori’s 
diversion. With a deep breath, 
Lou turned the starter key. The 
turbine whined to life. Lou pressed 
the throttle pedal firmly down to 
the floor. The engine coughed, then 
roared. Lights went on inside the 
house. 

He raced the engine once again, 
then put the car in gear and roared 
down the road. The shrubs and 
trees by the roadside blurred by, 
the wind tore at his face as he 
plunged down the twisting road 
toward the harbor. Lights were 
going on down there, too, where 
the guards’ living quarters were. 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



167 




He came screeching out on the 
flat, tore into the harbor area and 
pulled the car to a screaming stop 
at the foot of the lone dock. A 
small boat was tied up at the end of 
it. The game was going to be to 
make it look as if he wanted to get 
off the island on that boat. 

Men were piling out of several 
buildings in the darkness, shout- 
ing in languages Lou didn’t under- 
stand. He went to the back of the 
car, lifted the engine hood and 
groped for the fuel feed line. He 
ripped it out and felt a spurt of fuel 
slick his fingers. Then he went back 
to the front seat, grabbed the two 
extra guns and fired several shots 
into the engine compartment, 
backpedaling onto the dock as he 
did so. The third shot did it; the car 
erupted into flames. 

L OU raced down the dock, the 
burning car between him and 
anyone who wanted to come and 
get him. A few crates were piled on 
one side of the wooden dock and he 
ducked behind them. In front of 
him was the flaming turbowagon; 
through blurring heat waves he 
could see men running around the 
dockside area, some brandishing 
guns. Behind him were open water 
and the small boat tied up at the 
end of the dock. 

But somebody had already 
thought about the boat. He heard a 
crunching sound, the crash of 
breaking glass. Looking over his 
shoulder, he saw a chunk of the 



boat’s gunwale break into 
splinters and vapor. 

He crouched behind the packing 
crates. Long minutes ticked by. 
The fire in the car died down, the 
boat slid over on its side, gurgling 
obscenely. 

The shore had quieted down. 
Lou found it harder to see now but 
there must have been dozens of 
guards milling around during the 
height of the blaze. Lou knew he 
was trapped and that he was going 
to die. He realized that he had 
picked up a splinter in his left foot 
and it hurt. He wondered how 
Kori was doing. 

Diversion— ^Kori needs a diver- 
sion here . 

Squinting out into the darkness, 
Lou could barely make out a row 
of what looked like fuel drums 
lined up neatly on the shore near 
the foot of the dock. A dozen 
drums. Maybe fifty meters away. 
An easy target. 

It took him five shots before one 
of the drums burst into flame. In 
an instant they all went up. 

The shouting and running began 
all over again. Nobody was shoot- 
ing at him, either. They were all 
running either toward the fire or 
away from it. Lou watched the 
guards. They were good, no ques- 
tion of it. After the first momen- 
tary shock and surprise, they 
fought the raging fire with hand 
extinguishers, blankets, any- 
thing they could find. Finally 
somebody trundled up with a por- 



168 



GALAXY 




table foam generator and they 
started smothering the blaze with 
billowing white foam. But this job 
took time and manpower. 

The fire was smoldering and 
smoking when Lou heard: “Chris- 
topher! I know you’re out there on 
the dock. Give yourself up — you 
can’t get away.” 

Lou grinned. Marcus sounded 
neither angry nor frightened. Not 
even very upset. That meant that 
he didn’t realize what Kori was up 
to — or that Bonnie was hidden. 

Or he's got Kori and Bonnie and 
the whole game’s lost . 

Marcus called: “Christopher, I 
don’t want to have you killed. You 
can’t get away. We know you’re 
behind those packing crates. 
We—” 

Suddenly the voice stopped. 

Lou risked a look. Marcus was 
listening to a guard who was ges- 
turing and pointing up the road, 
toward the other end of the island. 

“So the three of you are in on 
this together.” Marcus’ voice was a 
little edgier now. “All right, we’ll 
just find the other two and bring 
them out here. You can watch what 
happens to them.” 

“Marcus,” Lou called out. 

Everyone at dockside froze. It 
was nearly dawn — clammy gray 
light made the shore visible. 

“Marcus, did you ever stop to 
think of what a good target you 
make?” 

Marcus jerked a step backward. 

“No, don’t move,” Lou called. 



“Don’t any of you move. If any- 
body twitches, you’ll get it, 
Marcus. I mean it.” 

Marcus stood frozen at dock- 
side. He was out in the open, the 
nearest guard a meter or so away, 
the nearest cover the burned-out 
hulk of the car, at least ten meters 
away. Lou prayed that none of 
them knew how many shots it 
would take him to hit anything at 
this distance. 

“Christopher, you can’t get 
away with this.” 

Lou grinned. “Can’t I?” 

As if in answer the packing 
crate in front of him exploded in a 
deafening blast and a shower of 
splinters. Lou felt himself soaring, 
slow-motion, tumbling off the 
dock. The shore careened wildly 
and the water rushed up toward 
him. As he hit the water and lost 
consciousness his last thought 
was that some rifleman had 
missed his head by just about a 
centimeter. 

XVIII 

P AIN woke him. It would have 
been pleasanter to stay asleep, 
unconscious, oblivious to every- 
thing. He hurt everywhere as if 
knives were being twisted under 
his skin. 

His eyes were gummy when he 
tried to open them. Everything 
was blurred, out of focus. A gray 
expanse of ceiling hung over him. 
And faces. He tried to raise his 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



169 




head but somebody pushed him 
back onto the pillow. 

“He’s conscious,” said a voice. 

Marcus’ face slid into view. Still 
calm. But was that perspiration 
beading his brow? 

“That was a foolish bit of non- 
sense, ” M arcus said without 
rancor. “What have you done with 
the girl? And where’s Dr. Kori?” 

Lou found the strength to shake 
his head. 

“It’s a small island, Christo- 
pher. We’ll find them sooner or 
later.” 

“Not before — ” he croaked. 

“Before what?” Marcus asked. 

“Nothing.” 

Marcus leaned closer. “We can 
find out. You can’t keep any 
secrets from us.” 

“Go ahead and torture me." 

“Don’t be an ass,” Marcus said. 
“There are drugs that will make 
you tell us anything we have to 
know.” 

“No—” 

Somewhere beyond Lou’s vision 
a door opened and footsteps came 
quickly toward his bed. A voice 
muttered something, too low for 
Lou to hear. 

“What?” Marcus snapped. 
“Why wasn’t 1 told sooner? When 
did — ” Marcus’ face slid into view 
again. It was red now. With anger? 
Or fear? Lou smiled. “Where’s 
Dr. Kori? What’s he doing with a 
bomb?” 

“Planting it in your lunch.” 

Lou saw Marcus’ hand blur 



toward him but he could not move 
out of the way. It stung and 
snapped his head to one side. He 
tasted blood. 

“Get him talking. And quickly,” 
Marcus ordered. 

Someone grabbed at his arm. It 
flamed agony. Lou saw it was red 
and sore with thousands of splin- 
ters. An expressionless Chinese 
doctor took his arm from the 
guard, held it gently, swabbed a 
relatively undamaged spot on the 
underside of the arm, then pressed 
a pneumatic syringe into the area. 
He put Lou’s arm back down on 
the bed carefully, looked at his 
wristwatch. 

“The reaction should take a few 
minutes,” the doctor told Marcus. 

Marcus paced the room ner- 
vously. The doctor stood beside the 
bed, patiently watching Lou. 
What time was it? How much 
more time did Kori need? 

Somebody giggled. Lou was 
startled to realize that the sound 
came from himself. 

The doctor turned toward 
Marcus. “He should be ready 
now.” 

Marcus came to the bed and 
leaned over Lou. “All right, 
Christopher. Where is Dr. Kori 
and what’s he doing with the bomb 
he stole?” 

“Playing in the sand,,” Lou said, 
laughing. It was funny, every- 
thing was so funny. Marcus’ face, 
the thought of Kori’s digging sand 
castles with a nuclear bomb tucked 



170 



GALAXY 




under his arm. The whole deal was 
uproarious. 

“Listen to me,” Marcus said, his 
face red and sweaty. “Quickly, 
before — ” 

The flash of light was bright 
enough to feel on your skin. For an 
instant everything stopped, etched 
in the pitiless white light. No 
sound, no voices, no movement. 
Then the bed lifted. The window 
blew in, showering glass. A 
woman screamed and a roar of ten 
thousand demons overpowered 
every other sensation. 

Somebody fell across Lou’s bed. 
The roar died away, leaving his 
ears aching. People started to 
move again through a dusty plaster 
haze, crunching glass underfoot. 
Marcus staggered up from the 
bed. 

Lou heard somebody say in an 
awed voice, “Look at that — a real 
mushroom cloud, just like in the 
history books.” 

Again Lou heard his own 
laughter. “You’ve lost, Marcus. 
You might as well admit it. 
There’ll be a government inspec- 
tion team here in a matter of 
hours. Followed by troops, if you 
want to fight. It’s all over. You’ve 
lost.” 

“I can still kill you — and the 
girl—” 

Lou was laughing uncontrol- 
lably now. The drug, he knew in the 
back of his mind. But there was 
nothing he could do to stop him- 
self. 



“Sure, kill me. Kill everybody. 
That’s going to help you a lot. An 
enormous lot.” 

He laughed until he passed out 
again. 

I T WAS pleasant to be uncon- 
scious. How did he know? Or am 
/ dead? He floated in darkness, 
without pain, without anxiety. The 
darkness was warm. After a long 
while it began to turn gray. The 
gray brightened slowly. Bonnie’s 
face appeared in it. 

Tears glinted her eyes, on her 
cheeks. 

Oh Lou . 

Had she spoken? He wanted to 
say something, to touch her, to 
make her stop crying. But he 
could not move. Did he still have a 
body. Her face faded, vanished. 

He began to hear voices. Strange 
faces peered at him. Blackness 
closed in again. 

Abruptly he opened his eyes and 
everything was in sharp focus. He 
was lying in a hospital bed. The 
walls of the room were pastel blue. 
The ceiling was clean white. View- 
screens and camera eyes ogled him 
from the ceiling. He found that he 
could turn his head. The move- 
ment hurt but was manageable. 
There was a window at his left. 
Sunshine was pouring in. A night 
table stood next to his bed. 

He tried sitting up. The bed 
followed his motion with an 
almost inaudible hum from an 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



171 




electric motor. Leaning back in a 
half-sitting position, he suddenly 
felt dizzy. 

A t least I’m not dead . 

His body felt stiff. Looking 
down, he saw that his hands and 
arms were wrapped in bandages. 
So was his chest; white plastic 
spray from windpipe to naval. His 
face felt raw, as if shaved with a 
dull blade. : 

The door suddenly opened and a 
nurse appeared. 

“Good morning,” she said with 
professional cheeriness. “Though 
it’s later, really.” 

“Hello.” Lou’s voice was hoarse. 
His throat felt rough. 

The nurse must have been push- 
ing forty, Lou thought. She still 
looked pretty good, though. 

“How do you feel?” she asked. 

He considered the question for a 
moment. “Hungry.” 

She smiled. “Good. That’s one 
condition that the automatic 
monitors still can’t record.” 

She was gone before Lou could 
say anything or ask any ques- 
tions. 

Within minutes a food tray slid 
out of the wall and swung over to 
the bed. Lou had barely finished 
eating when a knock came on the 
door and it opened wide enough for 
Kori to stick in his head. 

“Hi. They told me you were 
finally awake.” 

L OU’S voice felt and sounded 
better. “Come on in. How are 



you? Where are we? What hap- 
pened? Where’s Bonnie?” 

Kori grinned and pulled up a 
chair. He sat down. 

“Bonnie’s fine. She’s here in the 
hospital, too, getting treated for 
radiation dosage. There was a 
considerable amount of fallout 
from my little toy, you know. I 
stayed inside a cave until the 
government troops arrived — but 
even I got a touch of it.” 

“Marcus and the others? What 
happened to them?” 

“They gave up without much 
fight,” Kori said. “A government 
inspection team ’coptered to the 
island in four hours and eleven 
minutes after the blast. In another 
two hours a little army of govern- 
ment troops covered every square 
centimenter of the island.” 

“And what happened to me?” 
Lou asked. “1 remember trying 
to hold them down at the dock. 
Then somebody shot at me and I 
fell into the water. Then — ” 

Kori was trying not to grin. 
“What’s so funny?” 

“Well, forgive me, but you are. 
Do you know how they found 
you?” 

Lou shook his head. 

“You were lying flat on your 
back in one of the bedrooms of 
Marcus’ house. Stark naked. Sixty 
million splinters all over your face 
and body and arms and legs. And 
you were laughing your head off.” 
“Very funny,” Lou said. 
“Marcus had me shot full of 



172 



GALAXY

happy-juice, so I’d tell him where 
you were. So he could find you and 
kill you.” 

“I know*” Kori said. 

“Is Bonnie going to be all 
right?” Lou asked. 

“Oh yes, certainly. She’ll be 
visiting you herself in a day or 
so.” 

“And Marcus and his crew?” 
Kori shrugged. “In jail, I sup- 
pose. The troops took them away.” 
His face sobered. “One bad thing, 
Lou. Big George is dead.” 

“What?” 

“Somebody shot him. We don’t 
know who did it. It might have 
been Marcus’ guards or the govern- 
ment troops. Bonnie was right 
there and she couldn’t tell who 
fired the shot.” 

“Killed him? But why?” 

Shaking his head, Kori 
answered, “We’ll never know. 
There was a little fighting when 
the troops landed. Maybe it was 
just a stray shot. Or perhaps some- 
one got frightened at the sight of 
the gorilla. At least he didn’t suf- 
fer at all. One shot — he died in- 
stantly.” 

For a long moment neither of 
them said anything. Then Lou 
asked, “Where are we, anyway?” 
Kori’s face didn’t cheer up at all. 
“Back where we started. In 
Messina. It looks to me like we’re 
going to be shipped up to the 
satellite as soon as you and Bonnie 
are well enough to travel. To begin 
our exile.” 



T HE doctors made Lou stay in 
bed for a week. He saw Bonnie 
and Kori almost daily. But mostly 
he had time to think. So much 
happened in so short a time. Now 
he could think about it, look back 
on it and try to fit all the frag- 
ments together, to form a co- 
herent picture of what had sudden- 
ly happened to him and his life. 

We didn’t do right by you, 
Georgy . 

The future seemed bleak, though 
Kori was more optimistic. 

“After all we’ve done for the 
government,” Kori said one after- 
noon, at Lou’s bedside, “risking 
our lives to stop Bernard’s attempt 
at a coup — They won’t exile us. 
They’ll give us medals. You should 
get an award anyway — you’ve set 
a new international record for 
splinters.” 

Lou grinned but remained pessi- 
mistic. Too, he sensed something 
new and different about Bonnie. 
She was uptight, holding back 
something. 

One afternoon he asked her, 
“What’s bothering you?” 

“Does it show?” 

He nodded. 

“I’ve got to make a decision,” 
Bonnie said. Her green eyes looked 
troubled, sad. 

“About Kori and me?” 

“In a way. You see, Lou, I’m not 
officially on the list of exiled per- 
sons. I can go back to Albuquerque 

173 



EXILED FROM EARTH 




if I want to. Or I can go with the 
rest of you to the satellite.” 

“And stay for the rest of your 
life.” 

“Yes.” 

He took a deep breath. She was 
staring at him, trying to read his 
face, looking for something and 
evidently not finding it. 

He said, “You might never be 
allowed to make the decision. 
You’re in pretty deep with us now. 
The government might decide to 
exile you along with Kori and me.” 
Bonnie stopped, right there in 
the corridor. “They can’t do 
that — they wouldn’t” 

“They might,” Lou said. “And if 
they do, it’ll be my fault.” 

“There you are — I’ve been 
looking all over for you two — ” 
Kori ran down the corridor, 
dodging between frowning nurses 
and muttering patients. Breath- 
lessly he told Lou and Bonnie, 
“The General Chairman — he’s 
asked to see us. To talk to us. 
Tomorrow morning. The General 
Chairman!” 

Lou turned to Bonnie. For the 
first time, he felt hope. If not for 
himself, at least for her. 

D ESPITE his anger at what had 
been done to him and skepti- 
cism about the future Lou felt 
awed when the three of them were 
ushered into the General Chair- 
man’s office. Bonnie and Kori, he 
saw, were also wide-eyed and 
silent. 



The office covered the entire top 
floor of the tallest tower in 
Messina, stretching from the 
elevators to the sun-bright windo- 
wall where the Chairman’s ornate 
desk stood. 

“Come in — come,” said the little 
man behind that desk, in a voice 
cracked with age. 

They walked silently across the 
thick carpeting, past a ten-foot 
globe showing the Earth in color 
and relief, complete with net- 
works of tiny satellites orbiting 
around it. The globe hung in mid- 
air, suspended magnetically. 

“Forgive my not rising,” the 
Chairman said. “I suffered a 
stroke recently and the doctors 
want me to exert myself as little as 
possible.” His voice was soft, 
gentle, friendly, with an un- 
distinguished Brazilian accent. He 
was small, slight, his bony face 
high domed and haloed with wisps 
of white hair. His hands were 
fragile. He was very old. His skin 
was white and powdery looking, 
etched with a network of fine 
wrinkles. “However, I did very 
much want to meet the three of 
you. Please sit, make yourselves 
comfortable. Would you like any- 
thing to drink? To eat?” 

Lou shook his head. He chose a 
seat between Bonnie and Kori, 
facing the chairman. 

Silence fell. 

Before it could become awk- 
ward the Chairman said, “I want 
to express my personal thanks for 



174 



GALAXY 




your courageous actions on the 
island. You prevented an uprising 
that might have taken many lives.” 
“We did what we had to,” Lou 
said. 

The Chairman nodded. “It must 
have been quite a temptation, 
though, to put in with Bernard’s 
people and avoid going into exile.” 
Shrugging, Lou answered, “As 
far as I’m concerned that island 
was exile. There was no difference 
between the way the government 
has treated us and the way 
Bernard’s people were treating 
us — until the end.” 

Kori said, “I think we all felt, 
though, that the people running the 
island would be worse than the 
people running this government, if 
they got the chance.” 

The Chairman said, with a smile, 
“Thank you. It’s good to know 
that we are not completely at the 
bottom of the list." 

Kori grinned back at the old 
man. 

Lou felt irritated. “From what 
you’ve said it sounds like the exile 
is still in effect and that we’re going 
to be shipped out to the satellite.” 
The Chairman’s face grew 
somber. “Yes, I am sorry to say. If 
anything, this attempt by Minister 
Bernard to seize power proves the 
wisdom of the exile. Your work on 
genetic engineering has a political 
potential that is simply too power- 
ful not to be dangerous.” 

“So we spend the rest of our lives 
in a berryllium jail?” 



“What else can we do?” The 
Chairman waved his frail hands 
helplessly. “We are not monsters. 
We have no desire to make you 
suffer. We will supply you with 
everything you desire aboard the 
satellite. Anything — ” 

“Except freedom,” Lou 
snapped. 

WfflRUE,” said the Chairman. 

*But now there was a hint of 
steel behind the softness of his 
voice. “Yet many on Earth suffer 
more than you will—and if I must 
choose between the welfare of 
twenty billions and that of two 
thousand or so —I will choose the 
twenty billions. The mere hint that 
you might soon be able to control 
human genetics has already 
triggered one attempt at revo- 
lution. I will not see world society 
destroyed.” 

“But what about Kori? The work 
of the rocket scientists doesn’t 
really threaten the world.” 

“Perhaps not,” the Chairman 
admitted. “I must confess that I 
didn’t realize anyone except those 
working on genetic engineering 
had been sentenced to exile. Some- 
one in the bureaucracy considers 
the starship scientists a threat to 
world stability. I mu$t find out 
why. If they cannot convince me 
that you are a threat, Dr. Kori, 
then you will be released from 
exile and freed to resume your 
normal life. Also any of your col- 
leagues who have been placed in 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



175 




exile — they, too. may be freed.” 

Lou asked, “And Miss 
Sterne — what about her?” 

Bonnie murmured, “Lou, you 
shouldn’t — ” 

Lou persisted: “I want to find 
out about this. Miss Sterne was not 
sentenced to exile. She was brought 
to the island by Marcus who 
wanted to use her as a lever to keep 
me in line. She was the first of us to 
discover what was going on. Now 
where does she stand? Is she going 
to be shipped off with the rest of 
us” 

The Chairman said, “Miss 
Sterne is not a scientist nor an 
engineer. There is no reason for her 
to be exiled — unless she wishes to 
accompany you for personal 
reasons.” 

“You can really say that with a 
straight face?” Lou raged. “You 
can sit there and promise her free- 
dom when you know you don’t 
mean it?” 

“Lou, what are you saying? 
Bonnie reached out for his arm. 

The Chairman’s eyes narrowed. 
“Explain yourself, Mr. Christo- 
pher. Why do you call me a liar?” 

Almost trembling, Lou said, “If 
you let Bonnie go, if you let Kori 
go, what’s to stop them from 
telling the newsmen about this 
exile business? What’s to stop them 
from telling the whole world? Will 
you want them to sign a pledge of 
silence or will you do surgery on 
their brains? Because we both 
know you can’t risk having them 



tell the world about what you’ve 
done to the scientists ...” 

“Why not?” the Chairman asked 
gently. 

“Because the people of the world 
will demand that you release us. 
They’ll want our work to con- 
tinue — they’ll want us free. You 
can’t throw two thousand of the 
world’s top scientists into prison 
and — ” 

The Chairman silenced Lou with 
an upraised hand. “My brave, 
impetuous young man, you are 
completely wrong about so many 
things. First, I do not lie. When I 
offer Miss Sterne her freedom and 
raise the possibility of freedom for 
Dr. Kori, I am not lying. Please do 
me the honor of granting me 
honest motives. Next, the people of 
the world already know about your 
exile. We have not kept it secret. 
There would be no way to do so, 
even if we desired to. You cannot 
whisk away so many prominent 
men without anyone knowing it.” 

“They know?” 

“Of course. And they do not 
care. Do you think that the teem- 
ing billions of Earth care about a 
handful of scientists and en- 
gineers?” The Chairman shook his 
head. “No, they care about food, 
about jobs, about living space, 
about recreation and pro- 
creation.” 

“But our work — I thought — ” 
Lou felt as if he were in a glider 
that was spinning out of control. 

“Ah, yes, your work,” the 



176 



GALAXY 




Chairman said. “I admit that if 
you were on Earth and showing 
the world, step by step, what could 
be done — through control of genes 
then there would soon be an 
enormous demand for your efforts. 
Catastrophic reaction. Everyone 
would want his next child made 
perfect. I confess that our public 
information experts have tried to 
make it sound as if your work 
would show results in the next cen- 
tury rather than next week. Of 
course, having you all out of the 
way has made the job that much 
easier.” 

“And — nobody cares?” 

The Chairman looked truly sad. 
“The people are quite accustomed 
to talk of scientific miracles. 
Rarely do they see such miracles 
come true.” 

“But the food they eat, weather 
control, medicines, space expedi- 
tions — ” 

“All part of the normal, every- 
day background,” said the Chair- 
man. “Once a miracle comes true, 
it quickly becomes a common- 
place. And the masses seldom 
connect today’s commonplaces 
with tomorrow’s miracles. The 
promise of genetic engineering 
does not excite most people. 
Grasping politicians, yes — hungry 
workers and farmers, no.” 

“So the progress we worked for 
is over — completely finished — 

won’t happen. No way around it?” 

“I am afraid so. I have lived with 
this problem for more than a year 



now, trying to find some alterna- 
tive to what we’re doing to you. I 
am sorry. Somewhere we have 
failed. We build gleaming technol- 
ogies to turn ourselves into devils.” 
The Chairman shook his head. “I 
am ashamed of myself, of the 
government, of the entire society. 
We are doing you a dreadful in- 
justice.” 

“But you’re going ahead and do- 
ing it.” 

“Yes.” 

A dismal silence ensued. 

Finally the Chairman said, “As I 
told you, I will personally examine 
the matter of the rocket scientists. 
Dr. Kori, I cannot promise you 
your freedom — but I do promise 
to try.” 

Kori nodded and tried to look 
grateful but, glancing sidelong at 
Lou, not too happy. 

“And Miss Sterne,” the Chair- 
man went on, “you are free to go 
whenever you wish. The govern- 
ment will furnish you with 
transportation back to your 
home — or anywhere else you may 
desire to go. You will be re- 
imbursed for the troubles that 
you’ve been put to, of course.” 
Bonnie said, “Sir? Would it be 
possible for me to go to the 
satellite? On a temporary basis?” 
Lou stared at her. , 

“Most of my friends are there,” 
Bonnie said, looking straight at 
the Chairman and avoiding Lou’s 
eyes. “Maybe I’d rather live there 
than anywhere else. But I can’t tell 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



177 




you — until I’ve tried it for a while.” 

The Chairman folded his hands 
on his thin chest and gazed 
thoughtfully at Bonnie. 

“How do you think the others 
will feel, knowing that you can re- 
turn to Earth anytime you wish 
to?” 

“1 would only stay for a few 
weeks. I’d be willing to make a 
final decision then.” 

A small smile worked its way 
across the Chairman’s wrinkled 
face. “I can picture Kobryn’s 
reaction. Highly irregular. But — 
very well, you may have a few 
weeks aboard the satellite. But no 
more.” 

“Thank you, Bonnie said. 

She turned smiling to Lou. 

XX 

T HE satellite was literally anoth- 
er world. Lou had not seen it 
from the outside. He, Bonnie and 
Kori had been brought in a shuttle 
rocket that had no viewports in the 
cargo/passenger module. They had 
shared accommodations with cyl- 
inders of gas, packing crates of 
foodstuffs, motors, pumps, furni- 
ture. Lou swore he had heard, 
through an airlock that connected 
to a second cargo module, the 
bleatings of goats or sheep. 

The satellite was huge and pro- 
vided a strange environment. For 
one thing, one always walked up- 
hill. The corridors curved uphill in 
both directions, because the 



satellite was built in a series of 
giant wheels, one within another. 
Most of the living quarters were in 
the largest, outermost wheel, 
where the spin force almost 
equaled the full gravity of Earth’s 
surface. No extra physical effort 
was required to walk along the 
constantly uphill corridors be- 
cause the spin-induced gravity did 
not fight one. But Lou immediately 
resented the looks of the thing, 
hated it. 

His compartment — or room — 
was a marvel of compactness, 
plastic trimmed with aluminum 
spray paint. Lou thought of it as 
a cell. An astronaut would feel 
comfortable in it; a scientist on 
duty in a satellite for a month 
would put up with it — Lou real- 
ized he would be living in it for 
the rest of his life. 

Edmond Dantes has a bigger 
cell than this. 

Life had already settled into 
something of a dull routine in the 
plastic little world. Lou, Kori and 
Bonnie were met by a greeting 
committee when they stepped 
through the airlock from the 
shuttle rocket. They were shown to 
their quarters. After he had un- 
packed his lone travelbag, Lou 
received a phone call from Mrs. 
Kaufman, who was acting as her 
husband’s secretary now, asking 
him to meet with the Director’s 
Council right after breakfast the 
following “morning.” 

Time, of course, was completely 



178 



GALAXY 




arbitrary aboard the satellite. So 
everyone ran on the same clock, 
set on Universal Time. When it 
was midnight in Greenwhich, Eng- 
land, it was midnight aboard the 
satellite. 

Lou spent his first “evening” 
prowling through the uphill corri- 
dors. He was unable to find 
Bonnie, didn’t know where her 
quarters were or what her phone 
number was. Same thing for Kori. 
He could have asked some- 
one — instead he started walking 
along the main corridor. It was 
completely featureless. The bare 
plastic walls were broken only by 
bare plastic doors — all alike, 
except for tiny room numbers on 
them. 

Other people were drifting 
through the corridors, most of 
them strangers. A few were men 
and women with whom he had 
worked at the Institute. They 
nodded recognition or mumbled 
a hello. If they were surprised to 
see him, or wondered why they 
hadn’t seen him before this, they 
failed to show it in any way. All 
Lou could see in their faces was 
a vague guilt, a shame at being 
locked up here. 

The living dead . 

P ERIODICALLY Lou came to 
spiral steps that led to the next 
wheel, closer to the hub of the slow- 
ly spinning satellite. After passing 
several of them Lou decided to ex- 
plore one. 



The steps ended in another 
curving corridor, much like the 
first one, but smaller, narrower, 
with doors on one side only. Lou 
had expected the gravity to be less 
on this second level but he could 
detect no difference. Which meant 
that the satellite must be much 
larger than he had envisioned it. 

As he walked aimlessly along 
the corridor he came to a section 
that was dimly lit. Only a few dull 
red light panels overhead broke 
the darkness. Ahead of him Lou 
saw a motionless figure. 

“Greg? Hey Greg?” 

Greg Belsen jerked, startled, 
then turned. 

“Greg,” Lou said, smiling and 
reaching out to grab his friend’s 
shoulder. “Boy am I glad to see 
you!” 

“Hello, Lou,” Greg said quietly. 
“I heard they finally got you here.” 

Lou’s smile vanished. This was 
not the same Greg he had known at 
the Institute. The nerve had been 
taken out of him. Then he saw why 
Greg had been standing at this 
spot. 

There was a viewpoint in the 
wall — a small circular port of 
heavily-tinted plastiglass. Outside 
it hung the Earth. Rich, blue, laced 
with dazzling white clouds, beckon- 
ingly close, alive. It was swinging 
around in a slow circle, the reflex 
of the satellite’s spinning motion. 

“She’s only a few hundred kilo- 
meters away,” Greg said in a soft 
flat voice that Lou had never heard 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



179 




from him before. “Less than the 
distance between Albuquerque 
and Los Angeles. You could go to 
one of the airlocks and practically 
jump back home.” 

Lou’s blood ran cold. 

L OU finally met Bonnie and Kori 
again the following morning, 
after a fitful, tossing few hours of 
dream-filled sleep. They all arrived 
at the autocafeteria-restaurant at 
about the same time and found 
each other at the “menu” — a wall 
panel studded with selector but- 
tons. Only the breakfast buttons 
were lit. The cafeteria could seat 
perhaps fifty people, at long nar- 
row tables. It was nearly empty. 

“No morning rush to work, at 
least,” Kori said, trying to sound 
cheerful. 

When neither Bonnie nor Lou 
answered him he shrugged, turned 
to the selector panel. 

“Are you supposed to meet with 
Kaufman and the Council this 
morning?” Lou asked Bonnie. 

Kori answered, “Yes, at nine- 
thirty — ” while Bonnie shook her 
head. 

Surprised, Lou asked Kori, 
“You are? But you’re not from the 
Institute — why would Kaufman 
want you to report to him?” 

“Your Dr. Kaufman has been 
elected head of this colony,” Kori 
answered. “Didn’t you know?” 
“No, I didn’t. I thought Pro- 
fessor DeVreis-^’’ 

Kori said, “DeVreis died of a 



heart attack on his first day here.” 
“Oh.” 

Curiously, Lou felt as if some- 
one close to him had died. He had 
hardly known DeVreis, but for a 
man who had lived such a rich and 
useful life to be tossed into exile, 
to die here, in this place, seemed 
unfair. 

Kori turned back to the selector 
panel and tapped buttons for 
orange juice, eggs, muffins, 
sausage and coffee. Almost 
immediately a part of the panel slid 
back to reveal a steaming tray 
bearing his order. 

“Well,” he said, “at least the 
food looks good.” 

Turning to Bonnie, Lou asked 
again, “Kaufman hasn’t sent word 
to you?” 

She shook her head. “No, no- 
body’s said anything about my 
meeting with the Council. I guess 
they’re going to ignore me unless 
I decide to stay permanently.” 

Lou agreed. “Well, I’m sup- 
posed to see them at nine.” 

He was a few minutes late. It 
took him longer than he had ex- 
pected to find Dr. Kaufman’s 
office, which was in the second 
wheel. 

It was a long and narrow room, 
just long enough to have a slight 
curve to the floor. Kaufman’s desk 
was at one end, a long conference 
table at the other. All the furniture 
was made of plastic and light 
metals; it all looked temporary 
and cheap. 



180 



GALAXY 




Kaufman sat at the head of the 
table. He had lost weight, Lou saw. 
There were new lines in his still 
proudly handsome face. His thick 
hair seemed a shade whiter than it 
had been at the Institute. Greg 
Belsen, Kurtz, Sutherland and two 
strangers filled all but one of the re- 
maining chairs. Lou took the last 
chair, at the end of the table. 

After introducing the two new 
faces — representatives from labs 
in Europe — Dr. Kaufman said, 
“We’re all trying to accustom our- 
selves to our new environment. 
Our reason for meeting with you 
this morning, Christopher, is to 
ask you to select some sort of pro- 
ject for your working hours.” 

“Project?” 

“Yes,” said Dr. Kaufman. “I 
don’t believe that we should sit 
around and do nothing. The 
government won’t let us have the 
major types of facilities that we 
need for our old work.” 

“There’s no computer aboard?” 

Greg laughed. “No computer, 
Lou. No big toys for any of us. No 
electron microscopes, no ultra- 
centrifuges, no microsurgery 
equipment^nothing but early 
twentieth-century stuff: optical 

microscopes and Bunsen burners, 
the kinds of things you buy kids for 
Christmas.” 

Lou felt his lips press into a grim 
tight line. 

Dr. Sutherland explained, “The 
government doesn’t want us to do 
anything ffiore on genetic en- 



gineering. Even here. They’re 
afraid that if we start making pro- 
gress again we’ll smuggle the 
information back to Earth. And 
that’s exactly what they don’t 
want.” 

“What are we supposed to do up 
here? Decay?” 

“Nothing of the sort,” Kauf- 
man said, waving his hand in a 
negative gesture. “We may not 
have modern equipment but we 
can still do good science. We’ll 
simply have to be more ingenious, 
more inventive — make do with the 
simple equipment that we’re 
allowed to have.” 

“For instance,” Ron Kurtz said, 
leaning forward on the fragile- 
looking table, “I’ve never had the 
time really to write up all the work 
I’ve done over the last three-four 
years. I’ve published a few little 
notes in the journals — but now I 
can sit back and write up every- 
thing carefully, the way it ought to 
be done.” 

To be published where? Lou 
asked silently. In the chronicles of 
wasted time? 

“It’s quite clear that we won’t be 
able to make any further progress 
in genetic engineering,” Kaufman 
said, taking charge of the dis- 
cussion once again. “At least we 
won’t be able to follow our 
previous research, which required 
large-scale equipment. So we’re 
all trying to evolve ideas for use- 
ful work in a field that can be 
handled with the laboratory 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



181 




equipment that we now have. We’d 
like you to think about what you 
can do and how you can do it.” 

A COMPUTER engineer without 
a computer. Lou thought of 
Greg’s elaborate lab back at the 
Institute and its millions of dollars 
worth of automated chemical 
analysis equipment. 

No wonder he’s ready to jump 
ship . 

Aloud, he said, “Okay^I’ll try 
to think up something.” He 
started to get up from the table. 

“Oh, yes,” Kaufman added. 
“You must have some very 
interesting tales to tell about your 
adventures over the past several 
weeks. Maybe you’d be good 
enough to tell the whole popula- 
tion, tonight, over our closed-cir- 
cuit Tri-V system.” 

That caught Lou by surprise. 
“Well, I don’t know — ” 

“Of course you will,” Kaufman 
said. 

The discussion was ended. 

Lou stood awkwardly for a 
moment. The others started to get 
up. He turned and headed for the 
door. 

As he stepped out into the corri- 
dor, Greg said from just behind 
him; “Don’t get up tight about 
being a Tri-V performer, buddy.” 
Lou turned to him. “Easy for 
you to say.” 

Greg put an arm around Lou’s 
shoulder and they started up the 
corridor together. “Don’t worry, 



pal. All you’ll have to do is sit 
down with me and one or two oth- 
er guys and we’ll talk. That’s all. 
You won’t even know the cam- 
era’s on you. It’s simple.” 

“My big chance in show 
business.” 

Greg’s smile was touched with 
sadness. “Listen, we’re all going a 
little crazy for something to do, 
something to talk about. It hasn’t 
been easy, suddenly finding your- 
self cooped up in this squirrel 
cage.” 

They were heading toward the 
dimly lit section of the corridor 
where the viewport was. 

Lou asked, “And what’s your 
scientific research project for the 
next fifty years?” 

“You don’t want to see a grown 
man cry, do you? Weren’t those 
guys pathetic in there? They’re 
talking about redoing Calvin’s 
work on photosynthesis or writing 
their memoirs. Lord, they’re just 
going to fill in some time before 
they curl up their toes and die.” 
“That would be very patriotic of 
them,” Lou said. “The govern- 
ment would be awfully pleased if 
we all just passed away without a 
fuss. It’s exactly what they want 
down there.” 

“Hmp.” 

They were in the darkened part 
of the corridor now. Greg stopped 
in front of the viewport. There was 
Earth, swinging slowly, majesti- 
cally, in rhythm to the satellite’s 
spin. 



182 



GALAXY 




“That’s what makes it hard,” 
Greg said, staring. “Seeing her out 
there. Knowing she’s only a few 
hundred kilometers away — ” 

Lou grabbed his arm. “Come 
on, snap out of it. Let’s get some 
coffee. You going back in to talk 
with Kori? He’s due to see the 
Council at nine-thirty.” 

Pulling himself away from the 
viewport, Greg said, “I know, but 
I’m not going back in there. Those 
guys are looking more like a 
mortician’s convention every day. 
I think I’m going to go crazy — and 
soon, too.” 

Lou tried to laugh at him, gave 
up. 

T HE rest of the day was empty. 

Lou spent it prowling through 
the satellite’s different levels, the 
wheels within, wheels. He found a 
fairly decent library, a tiny audi- 
torium, some small telescopes and 
other astronomical gear scattered 
here and there. An extensive 
hydroponic garden ran all the way 
around one of the smaller, inner- 
most rings. The big event of the 
day was watching a shuttle rocket 
link up to the satellite’s main air- 
lock at the zero-gravity hub and 
unload fresh food and medical 
supplies. 

He called Bonnie for dinner and 
they went together to the restau- 
rant. 

“Do you know where Kori is?” 
Bonnie asked as they put their 
trays down on a table. 



Lou shook his head. “And I’m 
not going to look for him. I’d like 
to have you to myself for once.” 

She smiled at him. 

They ate with very little con- 
versation. 

Finally, as he toyed with a 
gelatin dessert, Lou burst out: 
“God, this is awful. Depressing. 
It’s just terribles^how in the name 
of sanity are we supposed to stand 
it? To spend the rest of our lives 
like this?” 

She reached out to touch his 
hand. “Lou — people are staring at 
you.” 

“Bonnie, get out of here. Tell 
them you want to get off on the 
next rocket. Don’t stay. Get out 
while you can.” 

“It does look bad, Lou,” she 
said quietly, trying to tone him 
down. “But it’ll get better. I know 
it will. Right now everybody’s still 
in shock. Nobody’s used to this 
yet. It’ll get better.” 

“No. It’s going to get worse. 1 
can feel it. Everybody’s totally 
hopeless. There’s no purpose to 
their lives — and all these lives, 
especially these, were built on pur- 
pose.” 

“They’ll adjust,” Bonnie said. 
“So will we.” 

“We?” 

Just then Kori came striding into 
the restaurant and spotted them. 
He ambled over to their table, 
smiling broadly. 

“I’ve been looking everywhere 
for you.” 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



183 




Lou snapped, “How can you be 
so cheerful?” 

Kori shrugged. “Well, I have 
good news for you. Greg Belsen 
said you’d be glad to hear it. But if 
you don’t want me to tell you — ” 
“All right, sit down, wise guy.” 
Despite himself Lou was grinning 
back at Kori. “Now tell me the 
good news. 1 could use some.” 
“Well — the shuttle rocket today 
brought my holograms. The ones 
from Starfarer. Dr. Kaufman said 
I could show them tonight and you 
won’t have to talk about your ad- 
ventures after all.” 

“Great,” Lou said. “Best news 
I’ve heard all day.” 

“Greg said you’d be pleased.” 
Lou walked Bonnie back to her 
quarters, while Kori went to find 
the special compartment that had 
been set up as a Tri-V studio. 

“You can’t stay here,” Lou told 
her as they walked down the corri- 
dor. “I won’t let you.” 

“But I can’t go back to Earth 
and know that you and Kori and 
the others are trapped here. I just 
can’t, Lou.” 

“Do you think it’ll make me feel 
any better to know you’re staying 
here because you feel sorry for 
me?” 

They were at her door now. “I 
don’t know,” Bonnie said. “It’s a 
lousy deal no matter how you look 
at it.” 

Lou nodded agreement. 

“Would you like to come in and 
watch Kori’s show?” 



“Sure I tried watching Tri-V 
shows beamed up from Earth for a 
while this afternoon. It kind of 
hurt — comedies and love stories 
and newscasts — all happening 
where there are cities and trees and 
mountains, winds and — ” 

“Stop it.” Bonnie put her arms 
around him and rested her head 
against his shoulder. “I know it 
hurts, Lou. I know.” 

A loudspeaker set into the 
ceiling broke in: “Tonight’s 
special showing of photographs 
from the Starfarer mission will 
begin in five minutes.” 

Bonnie straightened, looked 
briefly into Lou’s eyes, then 
turned to open her door. 

They sat side by side on the sofa- 
bed, the only comfortable piece of 
furniture in the cramped com- 
partment, and watched the view- 
screen set into the wall. They 
listened to Kori’s voice explain- 
ing what the pictures showed, 
watched the stars, the myriad stars. 
They saw Alpha Centauri again 
and focused on the fat yellow-green 
planet with its ice-white clouds. 

Suddenly Lou was on his feet, 
shouting, “The stars! That’s the 
way out! The stars!” 

. He felt as if someone had just 
lifted a heavy mask from his eyes. 

Bonnie was standing beside 
him, her eyes wide with bewilder- 
ment. “Lou, what is it? What’s 
wrong?” 

He grabbed her, lifted her off her 
feet and kissed her. 



184 



GALAXY 




“The stars, Bonnie! That’s our 
escape, that’s our purpose. Instead 
of staying here in exile, we can 
leave. Head for the stars. We can 
turn this prison into mankind’s 
first starship — ” 

XXI 

« PATENTLY impossible,” said 
* Dr. Kaufman. 

Lou was standing at the end of 
the conference table in Kaufman’s 
office. Kori sat at his side. The 
members of the Council showed a 
spectrum of emotions from 
thoughtful skepticism to outright 
scorn. 

“This is the most ridiculous 
suggestion I’ve ever heard,” 
Kaufman continued. 

Lou held on to his steaming 
temper. “Why do you say that? 
The scheme is physically possible.” 
“To turn this entire satellite into 
a starship? Accelerate it to the 
kind of velocity that Starfarer 
reached — or even more? Non- 
sense.” 

Kori said, “With the kind of 
fusion engines we now know how to 
build we could accelerate this pin- 
wheel to reach Alpha Centauri in 
less time than it took Starfarer. 
After all, the Starfarer was 
launched nearly two generations 
ago, it’s a primitive ship com- 
pared to what we can do now.” 

“But your own pictures showed 
that Alpha Centauri’s planets are 
not enough like Earth to serve as a 



new home for us,” said Mettler, 
one of the Europeans on Kauf- 
man’s Council. 

“You’re missing the point,” Lou 
countered. “The important thing 
is that Alpha Centauri has planets. 
Barnard’s Star has planets — 
they’ve been detected from Earth. 
Seven of the nearest ten stars are 
known to have planets; one of 
them is bound to be enough like 
Earth to suit us.” 

“Yes, I know. But it might take 
you a century or two to find a fully 
Earthlike planet.” 

“Let me ask something else,” 
Charles Sutherland said in his 
nasal whine. “Have you thought 
about the structural stresses on this 
satellite when you hook a fusion 
drive engine to it?” 

Kori answered, “I’ve done some 
rough calculations. It doesn’t look 
too bad. I’d need a computer to do 
the job properly, of course.” 

“And there’s no computer here,”" 
Sutherland said, grinning sardoni- 
cally. “And the government won’t 
give us one. Neither will they give 
us fusion engines. So the whole 
scheme is meaningless.” 

“I think they would give us any- 
thing we asked for,” Lou said, “if 
they knew they’d be getting rid of 
us. Permanently.” 

“Oh it’ll be permanent, all right. 
One way or the other,” Sutherland 
said. 

Kaufman frowned. “By asking 
for permission to try such a stunt 
we’d be telling the government 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



185 




that we’ve given up all hope of ever 
being reinstated on Earth. We’d 
be admitting that we expect to be 
exiled for the rest of our lives.” 

“Don’t you expect to be here for 
the rest of your life?” Kurtz asked. 

“No!” Kaufman slapped the 
table with the flat of his hand. “I 
have friends who are working 
right now to end this nonsense. 
I’m sure they are. And I’m sure 
that they must be making some 
headway. And so do the other 
leaders from the other labora- 
tories around the world. The 
government can’t keep this farce 
going forever.” 

Lou shook his head. “I’ve talked 
with the Chairman himself. 
There’s no doubt in his mind that 
we’re here to stay.” 

“He’s a feeble old man. He’ll be 
replaced soon.” 

“By Kobryn,” said Mettler. 
“Who is not going to hand out any 
pardons.” 

Greg Belsen turned to Kori. 
“You really think you can do it? 
Get us out to the stars?” 

“Of course. It’s only a question 
of getting the right equipment 
and support from Earth.” 

“And finding the right planet,” 
Lou added. 

“The planet needn’t be exactly 
like Earth,” Greg mused. “We 
could modify our children geneti- 
cally — so they’re physically 
adapted to the conditions on their 
new world.” 

“But the rest of us could never 



live on that world,” Kaufman said. 

“Mmm- well,” Greg said, “it’s 
just a thought. We’d still be able to 
make a homeworld for the chil- 
dren, even if we couldn’t find one 
exactly suited for us. I think it’s 
worth the gamble. Let’s try it. If 
nothing else, it’ll give us some- 
thing substantial to work on.” 

“Until the government refuses to 
give you what you need,” Kaufman 
muttered. 

“Let’s vote on it,” Greg 
suggested. 

“Now wait,” said Kaufman. 
“Before there’s any voting — ” 

But three hands were already in 
the air: Greg’s, Ron Kurtz’s and 
Mettler’s. With a shrug, Tracy, the 
other European on the Council, 
added his hand. Only Kaufman and 
Sutherland were opposed. 

Kaufman snorted. “All right. 
We’ll look into it. Dr. Kori, you 
may ask your colleagues to help 
you with the rocketry and astro- 
nautics.” 

From the tone of his voice it was 
clear that Kaufman expected the 
older rocket scientists to regard 
Kori as a madman. 

S OME of them did. They shook 
their heads and walked away 
from Kori, unbelieving. But a few 
accepted the idea. More as an 
amusement, perhaps, than as a 
real possibility. But they toyed 
with the notion, started jotting 
down notes, equations. Within a 
week the handful of rocket scien- 



186 



GALAXY 




tists and engineers aboard the 
satellite were all hard at work, no 
matter how implausible some of 
them thought the scheme to be. 
They soon took over all the desk- 
top calculators in the satellite, 
watching the numbers flickering 
fluorescently in the viewscreens, 
getting more enthusiastic each 
day. 

Greg Belsen was eager from the 
beginning. He started looking into 
the possibilities of deep-freezing 
people, putting them into sus- 
pended animation in cryogenic 
sleeping units. It had been done on 
Earth in rare medical emergen- 
cies — for a few days at a time. 
Greg wanted to put most of the 
satellite’s seven thousand people 
into cryogenic sleep for decades. 

“Either most of the people are 
going to sleep most of the time,” he 
told Lou, “or we have to rebuild 
this ship into a gingerbread house. 
Do you have any idea of how many 
megatons of food seven thousand 
people can eat in a century or so?” 

Gradually some of the other bio- 
chemists started working with 
Greg. Even a few of the geneticists 
let themselves be dragged into the 
problem, although it was well out 
of their field. 

Within a month Lou was asking 
a very suspicious government 
computer expert for time on high- 
speed computers. After a week of 
checking with Earth-bound sci- 
entists and government officials, 
the computer man allowed Lou to 



establish direct radio and TV con- 
tact with a huge government com- 
puter in Australia. 

“They’re double-checking 
everything we do,” Lou told 
Bonnie, “to make sure we’re not 
slipping in any work on genetic 
engineering. Slows us down — but 
we’re getting there just the same. 
Kori says he can’t see anything to 
stop us. If we can get the engines 
built and the radiation 
screens — other equipment, that 
is.” 

Bonnie nodded. If Lou had 
really looked closely at her he 
would have noticed that even 
though she tried, she couldn’t 
manage a smile. 

It took six months before they 
were certain. Six months of hectic 
work, calculations, conferences 
that lasted all hours, arguments, 
cajolings. Six months in which 
Lou saw Bonnie maybe twice or 
three times a week, sometimes not 
that often. And always he talked of 
the work, the plans, the hopes. And 
she said nothing. 

Abruptly Lou was telling Kauf- 
man, “There’s no doubt about it. 
We can turn this jail into a star- 
ship. We can freeze most of the 
people. We can reach the stars. 
Now we have to get the govern- 
ment to give us the equipment we 
need.” 

Kaufman said reluctantly, “I’ll 
ask for a conference with the 
proper authorities.” 

Shaking his head, Lou 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



187 




countered, “The General Chair- 
man once told me that if we needed 
anything we could ask him. I’m 
going to call him. Directly.” 

L OU stood in the General Chair- 
man’s office again, Bonnie and 
Kori beside him, as the elevator 
doors sighed shut. The room was 
unchanged. The Chairman called 
to them from his desk. The past six 
months aboard the satellite 
suddenly seemed like a remote and 
unpleasant dream. 

Did we actually live aboard that 
plastic prison? In that artificial 
little world? After a drive from the 
rocket field, through the green 
farmlands and bone-white vil- 
lages, through the scented winds 
and steady call of the surf, through 
the noisy, crowded, living 
city — the satellite seemed totally 
unreal. 

The Chairman listened patiently 
to their story, nodding and 
rocking in his big leather chair, 
steepling his fingers from time to 
time, even smiling once or twice. 

For a long moment after Lou 
finished talking, the Chairman 
said nothing. 

Finally: “Your ingenuity amazes 
me in a way. Yet I am not truly 
surprised that you have come up 
with an amazing idea.” He looked 
at all three of them in turn. “I will 
not presume to comment on why 
you want to leave our world 
entirely. I suppose that a purpose- 
ful death among the stars can be 



preferable to a long life of exile.” 
He laughed softly to himself. “I 
never expected that man’s first 
attempt to reach the stars would be 
made under these conditions.” 

“Then you’ll let us go?” Lou 
asked eagerly. “You’ll help us, give 
us the engines?” 

The Chairman silenced him with 
a gesture. “You mentioned that 
many among you are opposed to 
this idea — many who do not wish 
to fly toward the stars.” 

“Yes,” Lou admitted. “Our 
work to date has simply shown that 
it’s physically possible for us to 
make the journey. Dr. Kaufman 
and many of the others — es- 
pecially the older people — don’t 
want any part of it.” 

The Chairman sighed. “You 
realize, of course, that it all comes 
down to a question of money. 
Everything does, it seems. Sooner 
or later. It will take billions to out- 
fit your satellite for a journey to 
the stars — ” 

“We’ve computed that,” Lou 
said. “It’s expensive, but still 
cheaper than keeping us in orbit 
indefinitely. This way, you pay 
one big bill and we’re gone. If you 
keep us, you’ll have to feed us, 
doctor us — ” 

“I feel like Pharaoh arguing 
against Moses,” the Chairman 
complained. “I would be per- 
fectly willing to spend what must 
be spent and help you on your way, 
if that is what you wish. But what 
of those of you who don’t wish it?” 



188 



GALAXY 




“We’ll have to vote on it,” Lou 
said. 

“Yes,” said the Chairman. “I 
suppose you will.” 

They left the Chairman’s office, 
went down the whispering ele- 
vator and into the car that took 
them back through the semi-tropi- 
cal seaside farms of Sicily and 
toward the rocket field. But now 
the grass and sunshine and cot- 
tages were cruelties, sadistic re- 
minders that the satellite was real 
and permanent and they were only 
visitors in this beautiful world — 
their prison awaited them. 

They rode in the back of the 
open turbocar in silence. A second 
car followed at a discrete distance 
and somewhere overhead a heli- 
copter droned lazily. They were 
prisoners, no doubt of it. 

As they got close enough to the 
rocket field to see the stubby shut- 
tles standing in a row, Bonnie 
turned to Lou. 

“You shouldn’t have brought me 
with you today, Lou. You 
shouldn’t have.” 

“Why not?” 

“Because I’m not as strong as 
you are,” she said, shouting over 
the wind and turbine whine. “I 
can’t leave all this permanently. 
It’s bad enough in the satellite, 
when you can see the Earth out- 
side the viewports. But to leave 
forever — to go out into that black- 
ness — Lou, I can’t do it. If they 
vote for going to the stars I’ll come 
back to Earth.” 



“But I thought — ” 

“I’m sorry, Lou. I can’t help it. I 
checked this morning. The govern- 
ment will still let me return, if I 
want to. I can’t leave Earth for- 
ever, Lou. I just can’t.” 

She put her head down and 
cried. 

XXII 

L OU sat tensely in front of the 
Tri-V cameras. Next to him sat 
Dr. Kaufman. They were in the 
special compartment that had been 
turned into a Tri-V studio. Every- 
one in the satellite was watching 
and listening as they explained 
their positions on Lou’s starship 
proposal. 

While Dr. Kaufman spoke in his 
vigorous, emphatic manner, 
driving home points with accusa- 
tory thrusts of a stubby forefinger, 
Lou’s mind was far away. 

He kept seeing Bonnie’s stricken 
face when she admitted that she 
would never go with him to the 
stars. Kept seeing the green 
countryside, the lemon orchards 
and vinyards, the safe blue sky and 
friendly sea that he would never 
visit again. 

/ can't leave Earth forever, Lou. 
I just can’t . 

Can I? Can any of us turn our 
backs on a billion years of evolu- 
tion? Is that what I want them to 
do? Is it what I want to do? 

Dr. Kaufman was saying, “It is 
desperately important that we all 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



189 




realize exactly what is involved 
here. No one has ever built a 
manned starship. No one has even 
■attempted to. You all know that 
we get supplies from Earth reg- 
ularly. Even though we have 
closed-cycle air and water sys- 
tems, we still need replenishments 
of air and water at least once a 
month. As long as we remain in 
orbit around the Earth we can get 
those supplies and replenish- 
ments whenever we need them. 
But if we leave Earth, if we try this 
foolhardy scheme for going to the 
stars, we must have air and water 
and food systems that are abso- 
lutely foolproof. Now, I realize 
that manned missions to Jupiter 
and Saturn have used closed-cycle 
systems and they’ve worked quite 
well for periods of up to six years. 
But this star-roving we’re talking 
about will take decades. Perhaps a 
century or more. Why, none of us 
are even sure that a truly Earthlike 
planet exists out among the stars.” 
Kaufman shook his head, 
making a lock of his gray mane 
tumble over his forehead. “No, 
this star-roving idea is too risky 
even on purely technical grounds. 
We just don’t know how to build a 
starship. And even if the best en- 
gineers on Earth were assigned by 
the government to help us, we 
wouldn’t be able to keep the ship in 
working order, once we left Earth. 
We wouldn’t be able to repair it 
and maintain it. How many en- 
gineers are there among us? A 



handful. We’re research scien- 
tists, not grcasemonkeys.” 

Lou was 'istening with only half 
his mind, i he other half was re- 
morselessly reminding him: Life 
is ruled by the laws of thermo- 
dynamics, just as all physical pro- 
cesses are. You can't get anything 
without paying the price. Not any- 
thing. If you want the stars, you 
must leave Bonnie behind. If you 
want Bonnie, the price is perpet- 
ual imprisonment. 

What's the difference? Would it 
be any better pushing his beryl- 
lium nuthouse toward the stars ? 
We're all going to spend our lives 
inside this shell, wherever it’s 
going. 

Don't try to cop out. Heading 
for the stars gives everybody an 
aim, a purpose. Staying here is 
riding an orbital merry-go-round 
for the rest of your life, without 
hope, without anything but that 
big blue world hanging in front of 
your eyes, reminding you every 
minute of what’s been taken 
away . 

“And remember,” Kaufman was 
saying, “that as long as we stay in 
our present orbit there’s always 
the chance that the government 
will have a change of heart, that 
we’ll be freed. Once we break 
away, once we start out for the 
stars, there can be no turning back. 
The step is irrevocable. None of 
us will live to see us reach our desti- 
nation. Our children will age and 
die aboard this vehicle. Perhaps 



190 



GALAXY 




our grandchildren may find a 
world they can live on. Perhaps. 
That’s a very thin hope on which to 
hang the lives of every man, wom- 
an, and child among us.” 

K AUFMAN stopped talking. He 
turned expectantly to Lou. 
Suddenly Lou’s mouth felt dry 
and sticky. The cameras were on 
him now. It was his turn to speak. 
Should he try to convince them or 
toss the whole idea away? 

He 1 ooked past Kaufman’s 
handsome features to the big elec- 
tronic board that had been jury- 
rigged along the far wall of the 
studio. There was a light for every 
person aboard the satellite aged 
fifteen or over. When Lou finished 
speaking, they would all vote. A 
green light would show for each yes 
vote; a red one for each vote 
against the starship idea. 

Greg had briefed him moments 
before the debate had begun. 

We fought like kamikazes to get 
them to drop the age limit down to 
fifteen. After all, those kids are 
going to spend more of their lives 
in this pickle jar than any of us 
will . 

Lou heard himself clear his 
throat. He shifted uneasily in the 
chair. 

Then he said, “Dr. Kaufman has 
pointed out some of the technical 
risks in trying to reach the stars. 
He’s perfectly right. It is danger- 
ous. Nobody’s done it before. I 
don’t know — nobody knows — if 



we can make the engines and air 
pumps and water recyclers work 
for a century or more without 
fail.” 

He hesitated a moment. “Dr. 
Kaufman also told you that if we 
stay in orbit around Earth, there’s 
always the chance that we might 
win a reprieve. We might regain 
our freedom and be allowed to re- 
turn to Earth and take up normal 
lives again. That’s also true. It 
could happen.” 

Again he stopped, but only for 
the span of a heartbeat. Only long 
enough to call silently, ago- 
nizingly, Bonnie . Bonnie . 

Then: “When I first came 
aboard this satellite Dr. Kaufman 
asked me to go on Tri-V and tell 
you something about what had 
happened to me. I’m going to dp 
that now.” 

And he told them. He told them 
about the Federal agent in Charles- 
ton and his ride to New York. Told 
them about the man’s unhappi- 
ness at missing his family picnic. 
Told them of his night in New 
York, the gangs, the knives, the 
running, the terror. Told them 
how the Institute looked, emptied 
of everyone but Big George. Of his 
arrest, his arrival in Messina, his 
audience with Minister Bernard. 
He told them of the island, of Mar- 
cus, of what they planned to do, 
how they wanted to use genetic en- 
gineering and the offshoots of 
their biochemistry as weapons 
alongside an arsenal of nuclear 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



191 




bombs. He told them of what hap- 
pened to Big George and what had 
been in store for all mankind. 

Finally he told them of the 
gently implacable General Chair- 
man, who admitted that the exile 
was a horrible injustice, but could 
see no other course of action. And 
the people, the great masses of peo- 
ple, the twenty billions of people 
for whom they were being sacri- 
ficed, the people who knew of 
their exile but didn’t care. 

“This is the world we’ve been 
exiled from. A world where a few 
people can destroy the lives of the 
best scientists on the planet, along 
with the lives of their families. A 
world where savages rule the cities 
and civilized monsters battle to 
control the government.” 

He turned toward Kaufman. 
“This is the world you want to go 
back to. So let’s assume that we’re 
allowed to go back. Let’s assume 
that the government changes its 
mind and frees us. What will they 
do with our work? Can we trust 
them to use our knowledge? Can 
we trust them in any way? What’s 
to stop them from exiling us again? 
Or quietly having us killed? No- 
body gives a damn about us. All 
the rulers of Earth will ever want is 
the power that our knowledge can 
give them. The kindest thing they 
were able to do was to exile us!” 

Looking directly into the 
cameras, he added: “We have no 
one to turn to but ourselves. The 
choice is ours. We can orbit this 



planet, slowly dying, and hope that 
someday the government will 
allow us to return. But do we 
really want to return? I don’t. I’ve 
seen that world down there and de- 
spite all its beauty I don’t want to 
return to it. In this universe, with 
all its stars and space, there’s got to 
be someplace where we can make 
a better world for ourselves and 
our children. I say we should go to 
the stars.” 

He collapsed into his chair, 
feeling weak and trembling inside. 
Then the lights caught his eye. The 
vote shocked him: the green lights 
overwhelmed the few red ones. 

Somewhere behind the cameras 
people were laughing and clapping 
their hands. Somebody whistled 
shrilly. A door opened and Lou 
saw Kori and Greg heading to- 
ward him, grinning. 

Lou knew that Bonnie was in her 
compartment. Packed and ready 
to leave. She was probably past 
tears now. Crying wouldn’t help 
any more. The pain wouldn’t be 
eased by tears, or words, or re- 
grets. 

“You’re making a terrible mis- 
take,” Kaufman said, shaking his 
head. “Everything we need and 
desire is here, and you’re going to 
force us to turn our backs on it all. 
You’re making us leave our homes 
and head out into emptiness. 
There’s nothing out there for us, 
Christopher. Nothing!” 

Nothing, Lou thought. Except 
the universe. ★
