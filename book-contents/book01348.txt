PACKAGIIVG PEOPLE 



T he other day we toured the city 
of Chicago with an NBC Tele- 
vision sound and camera crew, in 
conjunction with a symposium on 
Design and the City of Tomorrow. 
One of the places we visited was an 
urban renewal project in the South- 
side, called the Robert Taylor 
Homes: a dozen tall apartment 
buildings, all shiny and new, on the 
site of what had been one of the most 
decrepit Negro slums in the western 
world. The buildings are, truthfully, 
pretty attractive. Each apartment has 
a balcony, where adults can sun 
themselves and children can play. 
Lake Michigan is not very far away, 
and from the upper balconies one 
can relax in cooling breezes from the 
lake and enjoy what is in fact a 
handsome view. Since kids are ac- 
cident prone, each balcony is cover- 
ed with tough wire screening, and 
they can be safely left unattended. 

And from down below the vertical 
rows of screened balconies look like 
nothing so much as cages in a zoo, 
and in fact the project is more fa- 
miliarly called “Ihe Monkey House.’* 
It isn’t really a fair name. It isn’t 
fair to the zoos. A proper zoological 
garden is designed with total care for 
the needs and habits of its inmates. 
Most slum-clearance developments — 
and with all respect to the Robert 
Taylor project, it fits right into the 
general classification — seem pri- 
marily intended just to get their in- 
mates out of sight. 

A month or so earlier, coinciden- 



tally in Chicago, we took part in 
another “life in the future” sympo- 
sium in which another participant 
was Dr. Edward T. Hall, an anthro- 
pologist at Northwestern. Hall is also 
an author, and two of his books are 
worth your attention: The Hidden 
Dimension (Doubleday, 1966) and 
The Silent Language (Fawcett, 
1959). What are the “dimension” 
and “language” he’s talking about? 
They are the human use of spatial 
relationships as a means of commu- 
nication, and the reverse: the mean- 
ing that humans get from the spatial 
relationships that are imposed on 
them. 

If this seems pretty far-out and in- 
tangible, you would be interested in 
some of Dr. Hall’s “candid camera” 
films of unwitting subjects being put 
through forced spati^ relationships 
that aren’t appropriate to the situa- 
tion. Queue up in a line: for a bus, 
at a ticket window, wherever. You 
automatically keep a certain distance 
between yourself and the man fore 
and aft. The difference varies with 
position — the end of the line is al- 
ways more widely spaced than the 
front; but if some clod comes along 
who violates “your space” by mov- 
ing in too close, you find yourself 
restless; you try to move away; you 
can’t because then you are intruding 
on the space of the man in front of 
you; you get up tight with hostility 
• . and if the ticket vendor makes a 
mistake in change, you take the top 
of his head off; and he never knows

The Dark Continents 
of 

Your Mind 



DO YOU struggle for balance? Are you forever trying to 
maintain energy, enthusiasm and the mil to do? Do your persondity 
and power of accomplishment ebb and flow— like a stream con- 
trolled by some unseen valve? Deep within you are minute organ- 
isms. From their function spring your emotions. They govern your 
creative ideas and moods — yes, even your enjoyment of life. Once they 
were thought to be the mysterious seat of the soul— and to be left 
unexplored. Now cast aside superstition and learn to direct intel- 
ligently these powers of self. 




Let the Rosicruclans; an age-old fia- 
ternity of thinking men and women (not 
a religion), point out how you may fash* 
ion life as you want it — by making the 
fullest use of these little-understood naU

why, and neither do yoii. Different 
nationalities have different social dis- 
tances. Arabs come up close enough 
to smell you, for smell is a part of 
communication; if you use a bland 
deodorant and wash yourself sterile, 
you may find yourself “socially of- 
fending” far more than the worst 
case of B.O., for in effect you are 
refusing to communicate with them. 
Latin Americans converse at closer 
range than North Americans. In an 
office conference in New York, they 
will pull their chairs closer to your 
desk; if the chairs are bolted down, 
as Dr. Hall’s pictures show, they will 
try to uproot them, even perch on 
the edge of your desk rather than re- 
main out of what for them is talking- 
distance. 

Too little distance is even more 
distractive, and hostility-arousing, 
than too much. A North American 
receptionist can’t work unless she is 
at least ten feet from anyone sitting 
in the waiting room; closer, she feels 
she must talk to him. 

S lum dwellers have three times as 
much heart disease as the rest of 
America, five times as much mental 
illness, four times as much high 
blood pressure. Why? Apparently 
much of it is simply crowding — too 
many people intru^g on each oth- 
ers’ social distance all the time. 

And there is another effect which 
is even more insidious. Walter Klee- 
man, Jr., of the National Society for 
Interior Design Environment Re- 
search Council, tells of a small-town 
college which took some slum youths 
into its dormitories. They were bright 
and able; the curriculum was not a 



problem for them; the dor^tories 
were. The buildings were severe mod- 
em, stripped down, functional, beau- 
tiful in an abstract sense. But they 
were made of such materials as plas- 
tic and exposed concrete; and, no 
matter what the designer’s intention, 
as Kleeman says, “the slum-dweller’s 
eye looks upon it and he hears a si- 
lent shout: “JAIL.” They were alien- 
ated; their education suffered. 

Packaging people is a far more 
subtle and demanding art than our 
society has yet come to understand. 
Applying the disciplines of architec- 
ture and design to it is far from 
enough; a proper design team needs 
an anthropologist, a sociologist (what 
would motivate a slum kid to better 
himself if he saw only other slum- 
dwellers all around him? Does “ur- 
ban “renewal” make any sense at all 
if it only builds shiny new slums 
where rotting old ones are tom 
down?), a behavioral psychologist — 
even a criminologist; for proper city 
design can be an important part of 
crime control. (Simple adequate 
street lighting is a major help. Or 
witness the broad boulevards of Par- 
is — Baron Haussman’s design to 
help Napoleon III deploy troops 
against rioters more expeditiously.) 

Of course, if we go on overpopu- 
lating ourselves into extinction no 
amount of design will keep this plan- 
et livable indefinitely. But we still 
have a certain amount of leeway, at 
least in most of the western world; 
if we are determined to inflict a high- 
density population on ourselves, it’s 
about time we took the trouble to 
learn how to cope with it.

by SAMUEL R. DELANY /; 



CCTT^hat do you knowl” Smith, 
from the top of the ladder. 

“What is it?” Jones, at the bot- 
tom. 

And Rimkin thought desperately: 
Boiled potatoes! My God, boiled 
potatoes! If I took toothpicks and 
stuck them in boiled potatoes, then 
stuck one on top of the other, made

heads, arms, legs — like little snow 
they would look like these 
men in spacesuits on Mars. 

“Concaved!” Smith called down. 
“You know those religious pictures 
they used to have back home, in 
the little store windows, where the 
eyes followed you down the street? 
The faces were carved in reverse 
relief like this.” 

“Those faces aren’t carved in re- 



verse relief!’’ Mak, right next to 
Rimkin, shouted up. can see 
that from here.” 

‘^Not the whole face,” Smith said. 
“Just the eyes. That’s why they had 
that funny effect when we were 
coming across the sand.” 

Mak, Rimkin thought. Mak. 
Mak. What distinguishes that man 
beside the k in his name? 

“They are handsome up there.” 
That from Hodges. “A ip^hole year 
of speculation over whether those 
little bits of purple stone were 
carved or natural — and suddenly 
here it all is, right on High Weir. 
The answer. Look at it: it means 
intelligence. It means culture. It 
means an advanced culture at least 
on the level of the ancient Greeks, 
too. Do you realize the spaces be- 
tween these temple columns lead to 
a whole new branch of anthropolo- 
gy?” 

“We don’t know that this thing’s 
a temple,” Mak grxmted. 

“A whole new complex of stu- 
dies I” Hodges reiterated. “We’re all 
of us Sir Arthur Evans unearthing 
the great staircase at Knossos. 
We’re Schliemanns digging up the 
treasures of Atreus.” 

I don’t know where any of them 
are, Rimkin thought. Their voices 
come through the rubber-ringed 
grills inside my helmet. All these 
boiled-potato figures against the 
grainy rust; that one there who I 
think is Hodges; the sun blinds out 
the face plate. And, for all I know, 



behind the plastic is a grotesquerie 
as deformed as those domed heads 
along the archetrave above us . 

“Hey, Rimkin, you’re the linguist. 
Why aren’t you poking around for 
something that looks like writing?” 
“Huh . .?” And as he said it, 
without hearing their laughter, he 
knew that inside their onion hel- 
mets they were smiling and shaking 
their heads. Jones said: 

“Here we are on Mars, and Rim- 
ky is still in another world. Is there 
any writing or hen-scratChing up 
there where you are. Smith?” 
“Nothing up here. But look at 
the surface of this eye, the way 
it’s carved outl” 

“What about it?” 

And then Jimmi — Rimkin 
could always tell Jimmi because 
her suit was a head and a half shor- 
ter than any of the others — climb- 
ed up the rough stone foundation 
blocks and with a beautiful “Mar- 
tian lope” and a wake of russet dust 
crossed the flooring, then turned 
back. “Lookl” He could always tell 
her voice, no matter the static and 
the distortion of the radios (long 
range; no fidelity.) “Here’s one that 
feUl” 

“Herel” Rimkin said. “Let me 
see.” They mustn’t think he wasn’t 
interested. 

Her soft voice said in his ear: 
“I can’t very well move it. You’ll 
have to come up here, Rimky.” 
But he was already climbing. 
“Yes, yes. Of course. I’m coming.” 

IF

And there was the sound of some- 
body trying not to snicker, identity 
concealed by lack of stereo. 

T he carving had fallen. And it 
had cracked on the stone flags. 
He walked up to Jimmi. The top 
of her helmet came to the middle 
of his upper arm. 

‘‘It’s so funny,” she said with 
that oddness to her laughter the 
radio couldn’t mask. “It looks just 
like a Martian.” 

“What?” 

She looked up at him, small 
brown face behind its white frame. 
The movements of her laughter were 
displaced from the sound in his ear. 
“Just look.” She turned back. “The 
great, high forehead, the big beady 
eyes, and hardly any chin. Wouldn’t 
you have guessed? Martians would 
turn out to have looked just like a 
nineteen-fifties sf film.” 

“Maybe ...” A third of the face 
had fallen away. The crack went 
through the left eye. What remain- 
ed of the mouth leered with prune- 
puckered lips. “Maybe it’s all a 
joke. Perhaps some of the military 
people from Bellona came here and 
set this whole thing up like an 
elaborate stage-set. Just to play a 
joke on us. They would, you knowl 
This is absurd, just the five of us 
taking the skimmer on a routine 
scouting trip across High Weir 
plateau, not sixty-five miles from 
the base, and coming across — ” 

“ — across a structure as big as 



the Parthenon! Hell, bigger than 
the Temple of Zeus!” Hodges ex- 
ploded. “Come off it, Rimkyl You 
can’t just sneak off in the morning 
and erect an entire stone ruin. Not 
one like this.” 

“Yes, but it’s so — ” 

“Hey! You people!” Again, the 
voice came down from Smith. 
“Somebody take a look at the eyes. 
Are they the same stone as the rest 
of the building, just very highly 
polished? Or are they some differ- 
ent material set in? I can’t tell from 
here.” 

Jimmi bent awkwardly and ran 
her glove over the broken surface. 
She who is dark and slender and 
the definition of all grace, Rimkin 
thought, muffled against the blazing 
ruin beneath deep turquoise skies. 

“It’s an inset. Dr. Smith.” She 
made a blunted gesture, and Rm- 
kin bent to see. 

The eyes were cylinders of trans- 
lucent material, perhaps nine inches 
in diameter and a foot long. They 
were set flush into the face, and 
the front surfaces ground to shim- 
mering concavities. 

“Lots of them are different 
colors,” Mak noted. 

Rimkin himself had noticed that 
the great row of eyes gave off an 
almost day-glow quality, from 
across the dunes; up close, they 
were mottled. 

”What are they made of?” 
Hodges asked. 

“The building’s that Marsite 



HIGH WEIR 



11 




stuff,” Jones said. The light, pur- 
plish rock “marsite” had been 
found as soon as the military base 
at Bellona had grown larger than 
a single bubble-hut. Rimkin, there 
with the Inter-nal University group, 
had spent much time looking at 
the warn fragments, playing after- 
dinner games with the military 
men (who barely tolerated the con- 
tingent of scholars), speculating as 
to whether they were carved or 
natural. The purple shards could 
have been Martian third cousins 
to the Venus of Wellendorf, or they 
could have simply been eroded frag- 
ments tossed for millenia by the 
waterless waves. 

“What are the eyes made of?” 
Hodges demanded. “Semi-precious 
stones? Is it something smelted, or 
synthetic? That opens up a whole 
world of speculation about the cul- 
ture.” 

“I can chip some off this broken 
one to take back — ” 

“Rimkin! No!” Hodges shouted, 
and in a moment the bumpy air suit 
had scrambled over the foundation. 
Hodges swayed on bloated feet. 
“Rimkin . look, wake up! WeVe 
just had the first incontrovertible 
proof that there is — or at any rate 
at one time there was — intelligent 
life beside us in the universe. In 
the solar system! And you want to 
start chipping. Sometimes you come 
on like one of those brass-decked 
thick skulls back at the base!” 

“Oh, Hodges, cut it out!” Jimmi 



snapped. “Leave him alone. It’s bad 
enough trying to put up with those 
thick-skulls you’re talking about. 
If we start this sort of bickering — ” 
“Stop trying to protect him, Jim- 
mi,” Hodges countered. “All right, 
perhaps he’s a brilliant linguist in a 
library cubicle. But he’s absolute 
dead weight on this expedition. He 
spends all his time either complete- 
ly uninterested in what’s going on, 
or worse, making absurd suggestions 
like breaking up the most important 
archeological ^scovery in human 
history with a sledge hammer!” 

“I wasn’t going to break up — ” 
Then: “Oh my — God .... No! 
This is — ” 

And Rimkin thought: Which one 
is it? Jesus, with all this distortion, 
I can’t tell what direction the voices 
are coming from. I can place any 
accent on Earth, but I can’t even 
recognize their individual voices any 
more! Which one? 

Hodges turned around. “What is 
it?” 

Jones, still down on the sand, 
called up, “What is it. Dr. Smith? 
What’s happening up there?” 

“This is just . no . this is 
amazing!” 

'^hey were all going to the base 
of the column against which 
the ladder was leaning. So Rimkin 
went too. 

The white-suited figure on the 
top rung was peering into one of 
the eyes with a flashlight.

IF 




‘^Dr. Smith, are you all right?’’ 

“Yes, yes. I’m fine. Please, just 
wait! But this . 

“That’s a low-power laze beam 
he’s looking in there with,” some- 
one began. 

“He said be quiet,” from some- 
one else. 

I can hear five people breathing 
in my ears, Rimkin thought. What 
could he be looking at? “Dr. 
Smith,” Rimkin called. 

‘‘Shhhhl” 

Rimkin went on doggedly, “Can 
you describe what you’re looking 
at.” 

“Yes, I . think so. It’s — it’s 
Mars. Only, the way it must have 
been. A dty, the city around this 
building. Roads. Machines that 
move, and a horizon full of man- 
made — buildings? Perhaps they’re 
buildings. The pictures move — and 
the streets are full of creatures, 
some sort of statue. No, they’re 
but some different. Some hurry . • 
some go slowly . this whole 
plateau, all of High Weir must have 
been some incredible acropolis for 
a mammoth, cosmopolitan com- 
munity. Wait! They’re unveiling 
some sort of statue. No, they’re 
presenting some leader to the peo- 
ple. Maybe a priest. Or a sacri- 
fice — ” 

After moments of silence, Mak 
said, “What pictures are you talk- 
ing about?” 

“It’s like looking through a win- 
dow onto what must have been here 



. on this plateau perhaps hun- 
dreds of thousands of years ago. As 
soon as I shine my laze-light into 
the concaved surface, I’m suddenly 
looking out on three-dimensional 
moving scenes, just as real . 
just as strange ...” 

Mak turned to Hodges “Is it 
some sort of animated diorama?” 

“It’s got to be some kind of 
hologram. A moving hologram!” At 
the top of the ladder. Dr. Smith 
finally looked down. “You’ve got 
to come up here and see this! I 
just wanted to look at the inside 
of the eye on this carving closely. 
I thought with the laze-light I might 
detect crystalline structures, perhaps 
get a clue to what the eyes were 
made from. But I saw pictures! He 
started down the ladder. “You’ve 
all just got to go up there and take 
a look!” 

Smith’s indrawn breath roared , in 
Ramkin’s ear. “It’s the most amaz- 
ing thing I’ve ever seen.” 

“Still think somebody came by 
and built this today just to get us 
off on a wild goose chase, eh, Rim- 
kin?” Hodges chided. “Let me go 
up and look. I’ve got my own beam, 
Dr. Smith.” Hodges started up the 
rungs as Smith reached the bottom. 

Frowning behind his faceplate, 
Rimkin took out his own flash. For 
a moment he fondled the tube; then 
he went back over the rusty sand 
tongues and purple stone to where 
the head had fallen. He looked at 
the whole eye. He looked at the 



HIGH WEIR 



13 




broken one. He did not know what 
perversity made him crouch before 
the latter. He flicked on his laze- 
beam. 

Tt took twenty minutes for Mak, 
^ Hodges, Jimmi and Jones to 
climb the ladder, watch for two 
or three minutes, then climb down. 
They were gathering to go back to 
the skimmer when Jimmi saw Rim- 
kin. She loped over to him. 

She laughed when she saw what 
he was doing. “Now aren’t we a 
bxmch of dopesi Some of us could 
have looked at this one down here. 
Come on, we’re going back now.^’ 
Rimkin switched off his beam, 
but still crouched before the tilted 
visage. 

“Oh, come on, Rimky. Jhey’re 
starting back already.” 

Rimkin drew breath, then stood 
slowly* “All right.” They started 
across the dressed stone flooring. 
The sand, fine as dust, spewed 
about their white boots like pow- 
dered blood. 

II 

'^he commons room of the skim- 
mer was a traveling fragment 
of classical academia. The celitex 
walls looked depressingly like wal- 
nut panelling. Above the brass-fix- 
tured folding desk surfaces, the mi- 
crofilms were stacked behind leather 
spines lettered in gold leaf. There 
was a mantelpiece above the heating 



nook. The glowing plates shot pale 
flickerings across the fur throws. 
The whole construct, with its bal- 
cony library cubicles (and a bust 
of JWchard Nielson, president of In- 
ter-nal University, on his pedestd 
at the turn of the stairwell) was a 
half-serious joke of Dr. Edward 
Jones. But the university people, by 
and large, were terribly appreciative 
of the extravagant facade, after a 
couple of weeks in the unsym- 
pathetic straits of the military back 
at Bellona Base. 

Mak sat on the hassock, rolling 
the sleeves of his wool shirt over his 
truckdriver forearms. He had head- 
ed the Yugoslavian expedition that 
had unearthed Gevgeli Man. Mak’s 
boulder-like build (and what fore- 
head he had was hidden by a falling 
thatch of Sahara-colored hair) had 
brought the jokes in the anthropol- 
ogy department to new nadirs: 
“This is Dr. Mak Hargus, the 
Gevgeli Man ... eh, man ...” 

Mak raised the periscope of his 
briar from his shirt pocket “Tell 
me about holograms. I’ve seen them 
of course, the three-dimensional im- 
ages and all. But how do they work? 
And how did the ancient Martians 
store all those pictures that just pop 
up under laze-light?” 

Ling Wong Smith dropped his 
fists into the baggy pockets of his 
corduroy jacket. He and Mak gazed 
over the vines growing along the 
window box. Outside the tri-plex 
pane, across the dusty bruise of 

15 !

High Weir, the dark colums — 
twelve whole, seven broken — 
sketched the incredible culture they 
had viewed in the polished eyes 
along the carved lintel. 

Jimmi pushed her dark braid 
back from her shoulder and leaned 
on the banister to look. 

Ling Wong Smith turned away. 
“It’s basically a matter of infor- 
mation storage, Mak.” He lowered 
himself to the arm of the easy chair, 
meshed his long fingers and bent 
forward so that his straight black 
hair slipped forward. 

“The Martians certainly stored 
one hell of a lot of information in 
those eyes,” Hodges commented, 
coming jerkily down the stairs on 
her crutches. She was large, almost 
as large (and soft) as Mak was 
large (and hard). She had a spec- 
tacular record in cultural anthro- 
pology, and combined a sort of 
braying energy, enthusiastic ideal- 
ism, and a quite real sensitivity 
(she had been crippled since birth), 
with which she had managed to stag- 
ger through all sorts of bizarre cul- 
tures in East Africa, Anatolia and 
Southern Cambodia to emerge with 
thorough and cohesive accounts of 
religions, mores and manners. Her 
spacesuit was a prosthetic miracle 
that enabled her to move as easily 
as anyone while she wore it. But 
outside it, she still used aluminum 
crutches. 

From his go game with Jones in 
the corner, Rimkin watched her 



lurch down the stairs. She must 
think they’re a psychological advan- 
tage, he decided. 

“Go on. Ling. Now tell us all 
about holograms.” She picked up 
one crutch and waved it at the 
Chinese psychologist, only just 
avoiding the venerable Nielson. 

“Information storage,” Smith re- 
peated. “Basically it’s a photogr^h, 
taken without a lens, but with per- 
fectly parallel beams of light — 
the sort you get in lazed light The 
^only scattering of the light is that 
which comes from the irregularities 
around the surfape of the object 
being recorded. The final plate looks 
like a blotchy configuration of 
grays — or mud if it’s in color. 
But when you shine the parallel 
beams of a laser light on this plate, 
you get a three-dimensional, full 
color image hanging over the 
plate — ” 

“ — that you can walk areund,” 
Mak finished. 

“You can walk around up to a 
hundred and eighty degrees,” Smith 
amended. “It’s just a completely 
different way of storing information 
than the regular photographic 
method. And it is far more effi- 
cient.” 

Jones said softly, from across the 
gaming board, “It’s your move, 
Rimky.” 

“Oh.” Rimkin picked up another 
black oval from his pot between his 
first two fingers and hesitated above 
the grid, dotted with white and

black. Bits of information. He tried 
to encompass the areas of territory 
mapped below him^ but they kept 
breaking up into the small corner 
battles. “There.” He clicked his 
stone to the board. 

Jones frowned. "Sure you don’t 
want to take that move back?” 

“No. No, I don’t.” 

“You can, you know,” Jones went 
on affably. “This isn’t chess. The 
rules are that you can take a move 
back if you — ” 

“I know that/’ Rimkin said loud- 
ly. “Don’t you think I know that? 
I want to go — he looked around 
and saw the other watching — 
"there!” The dick of his stone had 
been very loud. 

“All right.” Jones’s stone ticked 
the board. “Double attari.” But 
Rimkin was looking past Jones’s 
small, heart-shaped Nigerian face, 
to the others in the room, thinking. 
How can I tell them apart? They 
all just blend with one another. The 
room is round, their faces are 
round, stuck on Uttle around bodies. 
Suddenly he dosed his eyes. If they 
started talking, I know I wouldn’t 
be able to tell any of them apart. 
How is one supposed to know? 
How? 

And if I opened my eyes? 

"Your move, Rimkin,” Jones 
said. "I’ve got two of your stones 
in attari.” 

Rimkin opened his eyes on the 
grid of black and white. “Oh,” he 
said, and tried to strangle up a 



laugh. “Yes. That was a pretty 
silly move after all, wasn’t it?” 

Ill 

S uch an absurd move; he lay in 
his bunk with his eyes closed 
and his lips open over his teeth 
in a leer, trying to think of a better 
one. He hadn’t slept in two nights. 
An hour like this . maybe it was 
only a few minutes, but it seemed 
like an hour . and he sat up. 

He swung the reading machine 
over his bed and rolled it to the 
closing of the Tractatus. He’d been 
re-reading that the afternoon the 
skimmer had left Bellona; Wovon 
man nicht sprechen kann .... He 
pushed the machine aside and ran 
his hand under his undershirt. The 
skimmer would not leave till the 
morning. They should return to Bel- 
lona that night and report their 
discovery to the Those Who Were 
in Charge of Such Things. But the 
university people (especially the 
anthropology department) treasur- 
ed their brief freedom. One more 
examination of the site tomorrow, 
a few cursory readings and measure- 
ments .... 

Rimkin walked barefoot into the 
hall. It must have only been a few 
minutes, because strips of light from 
reading machines underlined three 
doors. Which room belonged to 
whom? He knew, and yet somehow 
there seemed no way to know .... 
Down in the locks, he put his air

suit on over his underwear. The 
plastic form-rings felt odd against 
his thighs and arms without the us- 
ual padding. He stepped into the 
lock. 

Outside, sharp stars dropped 
frostlights. The sand was filled with 
great slopping puddles of ink. Cold, 
cold outside. The little meter hum- 
ming in the vicinity of his chin 
kept the silicone circulating between 
the double thickness of his face- 
plate to avoid frosting. He stepped. 
And stepped. The desert suck^ his 
boots. 

The others? It was not even that 
he did not like them. He was in- 
finitely confused by them. June and 
shadow received him. As he walked, 
he looked up. One bright star was 
. moving. If he stood still, he 
could follow the movement dis- 
tinctly. Phobos? Deimos? He knew 
it was one of the two tiny Martian 
moons. But for the life of him, 
Rimkin could not remember wheth- 
er it was Fear or Terror that 
coursed the frozen jewelry of this 
Martian night. 

He saw the ruin. 

1 

He tried to blank the struggling 
anxieties that squirmed into the 
edges of his consciousness. Seven 
hundred and fifty-odd vitally im- 
portant enzyme reactions are occur- 
ring constantly in the human body. 
Were any one of them to break 
down for even two/three minutes, 
the body would die. So, just to fix 
the free fear that ranged his mind. 



he worried about one of these seven 
hundred and fifty-odd complex re- 
actions suddenly coming to a halt; 
until he lost the subject of his 
worry in the coils of sand. And fear 
moved free above him, tangible as 
the slender columns, the sculpted 
architrave. 

T Te looked up at the faces, ob- 
scured by darkness. The eyes 
caught and grayed the starlight, 
and regarded him. Rimkin began 
to paw under the flap of his pack 
for his flash. He found it after much 
too much time — he had forgotten 
what he was looking for twice — 
and rotated the dispersal grid to 
break up the laze beam into ordi- 
nary light. 

He played the beam over the 
stones. They were gray, new. He 
wondered if the purple were actual- 
ly only a reflection from the desert 
No, it was just the weakness of 
his beam. He walked along the sand 
to the place where the foundation 
could be mounted. He started to 
climb, once more aware of the inside 
of his suit against bare skin. The 
heating was working adequately, 
but the plastic and metal textures 
were so odd. He wanted to take the 
suit off and place his hand on the 
stone, then grew terrified that he 
might; because the Martian night 
was dmost two hundred degrees 
below freezing. 

Rimkin stood on the edge of the 
foundation and fanned bis light

toward the fallen head. He ap- 
proached across the sandy blocl^. 
The smaller fragment of face lay 
like a saucer. Its half eye had cracks 
all through. Rimkin squatted before 
the major portion of the face, leaned 
toward the fractured orb. He raised 
his flash, twisted back the dispersal- 
grid so that the bright, singular 
beam fell on the broken circle; 
flicker, and flicker, image and 
image. The fragmented orb began 
to weep the sights of ages. 

Dawn comes quickly on worlds 
with this atmosphere. It climbed the 
dunes behind Rimkin and laid its 
blazing hands on his shoulders. And 
the mechanism of his suit began to 
hum and twitter about him to pre- 
pare for the three-hundred-degree 
rise that would occur in the next 
twenty minutes. 

“Rimkin . .?” 

Who was breathing in his ear?. 

“Rimkin, are you up there?” 

The voice had been calling for 
some time. But with just a sound 
coming out of a machine by your 
ear, how was he supposed to ^ow 
what they were? 

“Rimky, there you arel What 
are you doing? Have you been here 
all morning?” 

He turned around — and fell 
over. 

“Rimkin I” 

He had been in one position for 
almost nine hours, and every 
muscle, once moved, was in agony. 
In the pain fogging his vision like 



heat he watched the boiled-potato, 
jogging toward him in a doud of 
fiery dust. 

Through his gasps he kept on 
trying to get out: “Who . who 
are . which . who are — ” 
“It’s me, Evelyn.” 

Evelyn, he thought. Who was 
Evelyn? “Who . .” 

She reached him. “Evelyn 
Hodges, who did you think it was? 
Are you hurt? Has something gone 
wrong with your suit? Oh I knew 
I should have brought Mak out 
here with me. The outside tem- 
perature is about ten degrees 
Fahrenheit right now. But in fif- 
teen minutes it’ll be a himdred and 
fifty or more. I can’t get you back 
to the ship by myself.” 

“No — No.” Rimkin shook his 
head. “All right. My suit. I’m 
just — ” 

“What is it, then?” 

The pain was incredible, but for 
a moment he was in control enough 
to get out: “I’m just stiff .... I 
was in one position for so long. I 
just . just forgot.” 

“How long is a long time?” 
Hodges demanded. 

“Almost all night, I guess.” His 
arms weren’t so bad. He pushed 
himself up and propped himself 
against the stone. 

Hodges bent down, picked up the 
flash (a feat she coidd only do 
with her spedally constructed suit) 
and turned it around. “You’ve been 
looking at the pretty pictures?” 



18 



IF 




Rimkin nodded. “Eh . yes.^’ 
She made a sound that had some- 
thing of confusion, something of 
frustration. “You just be glad I 
came looking for youl” She squatted 
beside him, and after mudi ma- 
neuvering, got herself seated. “I 
can never sleep past five-thirty in 
the morning anyway, and I got to 
thinking that perhaps I’d let myself 
get carried away a couple of times 
with you. You know, back at the 
base, with all those ribbons and 
brass flapping around, saying all 
those stupid things, weVe all been 
under a bit of pressure. Early this 
morning I was in the hall, saw the 
light from yoiur reading machine, 
and thought you might be up. I 
peeped in, because the door was 
open, but you weren’t in bed. I 
figured you must be in the library; 
but the doors down to the port were 
open and your suit was gone — 
well, this is the only thing around 
worth going out to look at. You’ve 
been here since last night?” 

“Yes. I have.” 

CCOimky,” Hodges said after a 
-^^few moments, “we’re all odd- 
balls in our way. You’re really not 
all that strange when you start look- 
ing at the rest of us. Maybe you’re 
just a little less used to fitting your 
angles into other people’s spaces. 
But I have been doing some think- 
ing. And I got a feeling I’ve put 
my finger on the reason you were 
so . well, preoccupied all last 



evening. Give a listen and tell me if 
I’m right.” 

She rocked a couple of times be- 
side him to settle inside her blimp. 
“Yesterday I said something about 
the Martians having at least reach- 
ed the level of the Greeks. But 
that was before we discovered the 
moving hologram records. That at 
least brings their technology — or 
one facet of it, at any rate — to 
a level comparable to the middle of 
the twentieth century. Or even well 
beyond. We still can’t imbed a mov- 
ing hologramic image into a crystal 
that just starts to playback auto- 
matically under lazed light. Now if 
they were all that advanced, then 
there should be scads of written evi- 
dence around here. If not things like 
books, then at least carved in the 
stone. But there isn’t a scratch, not 
a dated corner stone, no mayor’s 
name carved over the doorway. 
Hell, there’re at least mason’s 
mar^ on the blocks in the Khufu 
Pyramid. Now you’re our seman- 
tidst, Rimky, and it must be pretty 
important to you that there be 
some evidence of a Martian seman- 
tics. But the fact that there isn’t 
any immediately visible abouf a 
structure this imposing, coupled 
mth the fact that they obviously 
stored so much visually . Her 
voice hung on the word as a card 
player’s fingers might linger on a 
daring discard. “Well, there’s a 
good possibility, Rimky, that they 
just weren’t a verbal race, and they 



HIGH WEIR

somehow managed to achieve this 
level of technology without ever 
employing written communication, 
sort of the same way the Incas and 
Mayas reached their cultural level 
and still managed totally to bypass 
the invention of the wheel. If that 
is the case, Rimky, that makes you 
sort of useless on this expedition. I 
could see that getting to you, up- 
setting you.” 

He could tell she was waiting for 
some great reaction of relief; that 
the truth had outed. How did she 
expect to detect it? Perhaps the 
change in breathing woidd come 
through the suit phones. He tried to 
remember \dio she was. But there 
were all seven hundred and fifty- 
odd enzyme reactions to think 
about, to make sure that one of 
them didn’t suddenly stop • . • . 

“You know,” she was going on 
(Hodges? Yes, it was the Hodges 
woman). “I’m really the useless one 
on the expedition. You know what 
my talent is? I’m the one who can 
make friends with all sorts of Eski- 
mos and jungle wildmen. And then 
there were the mountain cannibal 
in the Caucasus who wanted to 
make me their queen.” She laughed 
metallically. “TTiey certainly did. 
I don’t care if I never see another 
piece of decayed yak butter again 
as long as I live. Rimky, I’m here 
just in case we run into a tribe of 
live Martians.” She looked out 
across the barren copper. After a 
few more moments she said, “I 



think you’d pretty well agree there’s 
a good deal more chance you’ll find 
Martian writing than I’ll find the 
models for those carvings up there, 
wandering around in nomadic tribes, 
And what’s more, it does get under 
my skin. I guess, being on edge like 
that, I’ve occasionally said some 
things, some of them to you, I’d 
have best held in. If you’ve got 
a skill or a discipline, you want to 
use it. You don’t want to drag it 
half way across the solar system be- 
cause there’s a one in a thousand 
chance somebody might just want 
a minute of your time.” She patted 
his forearm. “Am I anywhere near 
it?” 

Rimkin thought: Live Martians? 
If I were a live Martian, then I 
wouldn’t have to worry about the 
seven hundred and fifty enzyme re- 
actions that keep the human body 
alive. But then, there’d be others, 
different ones, even more compli- 
cated, even more dangerous, because 
they have to function over a much 
wider temperature range. Am I a 
Martian? Am I one of those strange 
creatures I watched in the beam of 
my flash, walking the strange alleys 
with the garnet-colored walls, driv- 
ing their beasts, and greeting one 
another with incomprehensible ges- 
tures? But this woman, which one 
is she? “Where’s Jimmi . .?’ Rim- 
kin asked. 

He heard Hodges start to say 
something; then she decided not to, 
and began the complicated maneu- 

IP

ver of her prostheses to stand. ‘‘Can 
you walk, Rimkin? I think I’d bet- 
ter get you back to the skimmer.” 
“The skimmer . .? Oh, yes. Of 
course. It’s time to go back to the 
skimmer, isn’t it?” 

He ached. All over his body, he 
ached. But he managed to stand, 
thinking, Why does it hurt so? 
Perhaps it’s one of the seven hun- 
dred reactions, starting to fail, and 
I’m going to . 

“Let’s hurry up,” Hodges urged. 
“If you’ve been out here all night, 
you’re probably on the third time 
through your air. I bet it’s stale as 
an old laundry bag in there.” 
Rimkin started slowly across the 
stones. But Hodges paused. Sudden- 
ly she bent down before the broken 
visage and shone Rimkin’s laze on 
the broken iris. She looked for the 
whole minute it took Rimkin to 
reach the edge. She made puzzled 
“mmmmmm” sounds twice. 

When she joined him to climb 
down to the sand, she was frowning 
behind the white frame of her hel- 
met. And a couple of times she 
made stranger faces. 

IV 

T he process of getting Rimkin to 
bed pretty well finished getting 
everybody else up. When Dr. Jones 
wanted to give him a sedative, Rim- 
kin went into a long and fairly 
cohorent discussion about the 
drug’s causing possible upset in his 



enzymal chemistry, which the others 
listened to seriously until suddenly 
he started to cry. At last he let 
Jimmi give him the injection. And 
while the pretty Micronesian quali- 
tative analyst stroked his forehead, 
he fell asleep. 

Mak, in his weight allowance for 
equipment Vital to the Facilitation 
of Your Specialized Functions, had 
secreted a Westphalian ham and a 
gallen of the good Slivowitz, con- 
tending that breakfast was pointless 
without a hefty slice of the one and 
a pony of the other. But he was 
willing to share; the ritual of break- 
fast was left to his episcopacy. 
Anyway, he had the best luck 
among them beating dehydrated 
eggs back into shape. Now in the 
small area under the steps where 
such things were done, he was 
clanking and fuming like a rum- 
and-maple dragon. 

Smith came down the stairs. 

A skillet cover rang on the pan 
rim. Mak grunted. “I didn’t realize 
he was that bad. Ling.” 

Jones folded the gaming beard; 
the pattern of white and black fell 
apart. He slid the pebbles into the 
pot, and pushed the stud on the pot 
base. “I guess none of us did.” The 
pot began to vibrate. The white 
stones were substantially less dense 
than the black ones, so, after a good 
shaking, ended up on top. “Do you 
think Mars is just too much for 
him?” Dr. Jones had already no- 
ticed that the separation process

took longer on this light-weight 
planet than at home. 

^‘Naw.” Mak ducked from under 
the stairs with his platter of ham 
and eggs. The steam rose and mixed 
with the pipe smoke. ‘This must 
have been building for months, 
maybe all his life, if the Freudians 
are to be trusted.” 

He leaned over hefty Miss 
Hodges and set the platter down. 
Then he frowned at her. 'Tou look 
oddly pensive, ma’am.” 

Hodges, using her aluminum 
stalks, pushed herself around from 
the table so she could see Smith, 
who was at the bottom of the stairs. 
“What happens if you cut — or 
break — a hologram plate in half. 
Ling?” 

guess you get half the pic- 
ture,” Jimmi said. She was sitting 
on the top step. Richard Neilson 
was staring directly at the top of 
her head. 

“If I sit down at the table be- 
fore the rest of you,” Mak said, 
ducking under the steps for the 
coffee pot, “you’re only going to 
get half your breakfast.” 

Smith, Jones and Jimmi took 
their chairs. Mak set the steaming 
enameled pot (it too was from 
Yugoslavia, and had come ^th 
Vital Equipment) on the coffee tile, 
sat down and took four pieces of 
toast. 

“Actually you don’t.” Ling passed 
the egg platter to Hodges. “If you 
think of it as a method of informa- 



tion storage, you’ll understand. You 
take the ordinary hologram plate, 
cut it half, and ^en shine a lazed 
beam on it, and you get the com- 
plete, threeAlimensional image hang- 
ing there, full size. Only it’s slightly 
out of focus, blurry, a little less dis- 
tinct.” He folded a sliver of ham 
with blackened edges and skewered 
it to some toast. “And if you cut 
it again, the image just goes a bit 
more out of fucus. Try and imagine 
a photograph and a hologram of 
the same object side by side. Every 
dot of light-sensitive emulsion on 
each is a bit of information about 
the object. But the information 
dots on the photographic plate only 
relate to one point of a two-dimen- 
sional reduction. The information 
dots on the hologram plate relate 
to the entire, solid, three-dimension- 
al object. Theoretically, even a 
square milimeter cut from a holo- 
gram will have something to tell 
you about the whole object” 

“Does that ‘theoretical’ mean 
something,” Mak asked, between 
burblings of his briar, “or is it just 
rhetoric?” 

4 ^ AX/'dl,” Ling said, “there is a 
point of diminishing re- 
turns. From what I’ve said, it would 
seem that hologramic information 
storage would be vastly more ef- 
ficient than photographic. But most 
human methods of information stor- 
age are essentially photographic; 
writing, tape, punchcar^ — ” 

IF 



22 




“But those are all linear,” Dr. 
Jones objected. 

“Photographic in that there’s a 
one to one relation between each 
datum and each un-integrated fact 
datum and each un-integrated 
fact — ” 

“Think of a photograph as com- 
posed of the lines of a television 
picture,” Jimmi said, hastily swal- 
lowing eggs and toast. “A photo- 
graph can be reduced to line terms 
too.” 

“That’s right,” Ling said. 

“Diminishing returns . • 
Hodges prompted. 

“Oh yes. It’s simply this: if you 
only have a relatively small number 
of addresses — cybernetics term for 
the places your data are going to 
go,” he explained to Jimmi’s puzzled 
look, “then you’re often better off 
with photographic or linear infor- 
mation. Because you need so many 
bits of hologramic information be- 
fore the image starts to clear enough 
to be — ” 

“ — anything but a dark, menac- 
ing shadow, a ghost, a specter of 
itself, a vague outline filled with the 
unknown and too insubstantial to 
contain it.” 

Everyone looked at Hodges, sur- 
prised. 

“What are you talking about, 
Evelyn?” 

“Rimkin.” She gestured with her 
brandy glass to keep Mak from 
filling it beyond the brim. “Poor, 
crazy Rimky.” 



“Oh, he isn’t crazy,” Jones in- 
sisted. “He may be having a nerv- 
ous breakdown on us, which is too 
bad. But he’s a brilliant, brilliant 
man. He did end up beating me 
at go last night. Sometimes I’m 
just afraid these sort of situations 
are merely occupational hazards.” 
“True, Jonesy.” She smiled rue- 
fully and sipped. And that’s all I 
meant by crazy.” 

“You brought this whole busi- 
ness up in the first place, about the 
broken holograms,” Ling said. 
“Why, Evelyn?” 

The inflamed light of the morning 
desert jeweled the tiny glass in her 
puffy fingers. “Do you remember 
the head that had fallen from the 
frieze?It was cracked so that one 
of the eyes had broken in half. 
When I found him this morning, 
he’d been out all night with his 
laze beam looking at the images 
in the broken eye.” She put her 
glass on the table. 

After a while. Dr. Smith asked, 
“Did you take a look?” 

Evel3m Hodges nodded. 

“WeU?” Mak asked. 

“Just what you said. Ling. The 
images were whole. But they were 
slightly blurred, out of focus. I 
think there was something off with 
the timing too. That’s all.” 

Mak leaned forward, made dis- 
gusted sound, and began to batter 
his ashes over the detritus of crusts 
and butter on his plate. “Let’s go 
out and finish up those measure-

e didn’t. 

He woke fighting the drug af- 
ter they had been gone twenty min- 
utes. 

And he still didn’t know where 
he was. Not where he should be, 
certainly. Because his head hurt; 
it felt as though the side had been 
broken away. His whole body was 
sore. He lurched from the bed and 
tried to focus on the objects, — 
pillow, reading machine, boxes of 
microfilm on the table — but they 
all had vague haloes like the super- 
imposition from special-effect se- 
quences in old color films. 

Jimmi was sitting on the bottom 
step, reading. She had chosen (a 
little unwillingly) to stay with the 
patient. 

Crash/ 

She looked up. 

Richard Nielson was trundling 
down the steps toward her. And at 
the top, stood naked Rimkin. Jimmi 
leapt away as the bust struck the 
reader she had dropped on the 
steps. 

“Rimky, are you . .?” 

He came down the steps, three 
of them slowly, seven of them fast, 
the last two slowly. Then, while 
she was debating whether to try 




and restrain him physically, he was 
gone through the double doors to 
the lockers. She ran toward them 
— the two brass handles swung 
up and clicked. She crashed against 
them. But behind the veneer that 
looked like walnut paneling was 
ribbed steel. 

Inside the locker Rimkin fumbled 
the catches of his air suit and 
thought. Hot. Hot outside. Twice 
he dropped the contraption on the 
grilled floor. Boiled . boiled 
something. An earthman would boil 
out there on the desert without a 
suit. But why was he worrying? He 
wasn’t sure who or what he might 
be. But the streets with their shaggy 
pennants, and their elegant citizens 
walking their shambling beasts with

shapes of time-cast dust and which 
were the intelligent creations of the 
amazing culture of his people, his 
planet? He brushed his arm around 
his face plate — but that didn’t do 
any good. 

He walked down the blazing, 
alien street. 

And the street sucked his boots. 

He was going to take off his air 
suit soon. Yes. Because there was 
no need for it in such a brilliant 
city. But wait just a few minutes, 
because things were still too un- 
focused, too amorphous. And sand, 
from when he’d brushed his arm 
across his face plate, kept trickling 
down his vision. Nor were the fig- 
ures in front of him Martians. He 
didn’t think they were Martians. 
They were white and bulbous and 
were busy about the shards of pur- 
ple stone, doing things to the slim 
columns that rose to prick the 
Martian noon. 

“Who are you?” he said. 

Two of them turned around. 

“Rimkin . .!” 

“I don’t know who you are,” he 
told them. 

“Hey, what’s he doing out here?” 

“I’m a Martian,” Rimkin told 
them. “You’re nothing but . that’s 
right, boiled potatoesl” He tried to 
laugh, but it came out crying be- 
cause his head hurt very badly, and 
he was dopey from what ever they 
had given him that morning. 

“We’ve got to get him back to 
the skimmer. Come on, Rimky.” 



“I’m going to take off my air 
suit,” he said. “Because I’m a Mar- 
tian and you — ” 

But then they were all around 
him. And they kept holding his 
hands down, which was easy be- 
cause he was weak from the drug. 
And the carved heads, the gleaming 
eyes, melted behind his tears. 

“^mkin! Rimkinl Are you out 
there? Evelyn, Mak, Rimkin’s out 
there some place!” 

“We’ve got him, Jimmi! It’s all 
right We”re bringing back to the 
skimmer.” 

“Who are you? I can’t tell who 
you are?” 

“Oh, Rimky, are you all right?” 

“I’m a Martian. I can take off 
my spacesuit — ” 

“No, you don’t, fellow. Keep your 
hands down.” 

“I think you’re all crazy, you 
know? I’m a Martian, but you’re 
all talking to somebody who isn’t 
even here!” 

“Rinokin, go on back with them 
and don’t give them any trouble. 
For me, for Jimmi. They just want 
to help.” 

“I don’t even know you. Why do 
I have to come back? This is my 
city. These are my buildings, my 
house. It’s just not clear, any more. 
And it hurts.” 

“Keep your hands down. Come 
on — ” 

“Jimmi, are you all right? How 
did he get out? He didn’t hurt you, 
did he?”

“I guess the sedative wasn’t 
strong enough. He surprised me, 
^nd managed to lock me in the 
study. I just found Evelyn’s emer- 
gency keys in her room a minute 
ago so I could get down to the 
controls and radio you. What are we 
going to do with him?” 

“I’m going to go to Mars. I can 
take off my spacesuit. I’m a Mar- 
tian. I’m a Martian — ” 

4CTTe doesn’t seem to be dan- 
gerous. They’ll get him back 
to Earth, fill him full of calming 
drugs, and in six months he’ll prob- 
ably be good as new. I wouldn’t be 
surprised to find out he goes into 
this sort of thing periodically. I 
spent a couple of weeks in a hos- 
pital dr 3 ung out once.” 

“Why can’t I take off my suit? 
I’m a Mart — ” 

“Rimky, remember all those 
enzyme reactions you were going on 
at us about this morning when you 
didn’t want to take your shot? You 
open your suit, and the temperature 
out here will work so much havoc 
with them you won’t have time to 
blink. You’ll also fry.” 

“But which ones? How can I 
tell which ones will . .” 

“Evelyn, I can’t hit him over the 
head I’ll crack his helmet.” 

“I know, I know, Mak. We’ll get 
him back. Oh, this is so terriblel 
What causes something like this to 
happen to a perfectly fine — more 
thm fine mind, Ling?” 



“Don’t hit me over the head. 
Don’t . I’m a Martian. And it 
hurts.” 

“We won’t hurt you, Rimky” 
“Evelyn, we’re out here exploring 
the ruins of new civilizations on 
other planets and we still don’t 
. know. We know much of it’s chemi- 
cal, and we can do something about 
a lot of it, but we still don’t .... 
Holograms, Evelyn . .” 

“What, Ling?” 

“Nobody’s ever been able to fig- 
ure out how the brain stores infor- 
mation. We know the mind remem- 
bers everything it sees, hears, feels, 
smells, as well as all sorts of cross- 
referencing. People have just always 
assumed that it must be basically 
a photographic process, all the sepa- 
rate bits of data stored on the junc- 
ture of each individual synapse. 
But suppose, Evelyn, the brain 
stores hologramically. Tlien madness 
would be some emotional or chemi- 
cal situation that blocked off access 
to large parts of the cerebral holo- 
gram.” 

“Then large parts of the world 
would just lose their sharpness, 
their focus . .” 

“Like Rimkin, here.” 

“Keep your hands away from 
your suit catch 1” 

“Come on, Rimkin. Once we get 
you home, you’ll be all right.” 

“It won’t hurt any more?” 
“That’s right. Try to relax.” 

As they reached the rock, Rim- 
kin turned to one of the white, in-

Japanese Science Fiction 

by TAKUMI SHIBANO 



Japanese science fiction and its 
fandom, told by Our Man in Tokyo 



'^Teedless to say, Japan was at 
one time among the least ad- 
vanced countries in the field of 
science fiction. This was not be- 
cause the Japanese people could 
not understand the modern attitude 
— the sense of scientific rational- 
ization for the fantastically chaotic 
universe. In the pre-Amazing era, 
which was the period of rapid ad- 
vancement of civilization in Japan, 
we had several active adventure 
writers, such as Shunro Oshikawa, 
who was supposed to be a Japanese 
version of Jules Verne. And in the 
period between the two World Wars 



there appeared several writers of 
straight fantasy and pure scienti- 
fic-fiction stories. The most popular 
and capable among them was Juza 
Unno, who introduced the attitudes 
of the newly developing s-f stories 
of Hugo Gernsback and others for 
the first time in the 1930’s. He ap- 
pealed mainly to young readers and 
was not at all esteemed in the field 
of general literature. 

After the second World War, a 
flood of s-f paperbacks, discarded 
by GI’s in the allied forces, filled 
the shelves of the second-hand book 
shops in the big cities. This stimu- 



29 





lated some ambitious publishers to 
attempt a series of translations of 
this new type of literature. Most of 
these trials failed because of lim- 
ited sales. Anthologies from Amaz- 
ing Stories by Seibundo-Shinkosha 
Company folded after seven books, 
and the Gengensha S-F Series went 
bankrupt after twenty books. These 
were the main efforts during this 
period. 

However, the interest of readers 
was developing gradually, and for 
the first time in 1957 the Hayaka- 
wa Fantasy Series — published by 
Hayakawa-Shobo Company — 
made suffident of a success to be 
able to continue publication. Start- 
ing in December of ’57 and chang- 
ing its title to Hayakawa SF Series 
as the sales increased, they had 
issued about 170 titles by the early 
part of 1968. Most books in this 
series are translations of U.S. and 
British stories, but a few German 
and Russian stories are induded, as 
well as some twenty Japanese orig- 
inal novels and collections. 

A little barlier than this success- 
ful effort in prodom, the history of 
our fandom began with the start of 
a club of s-f fans and writers. Its 
fanzine, Vchujin (meaning cosmic 
dust) first appeared in May, 1957. 
Publication yta& continued at month- 
ly intervals, reaching its 120th issue 
this February. This is famous as 
the largest and most authoritative 
fanzine — or perhaps a semi-pro- 
zine, with its drculation of 500 — 



and has made Takumi Shibano (b. 
1926), its establisher-editor-publish- 
er, a major name in Japanese fan- 
dom. More than half of the inrriters 
who are now supporting the Japa- 
nese s-f field have grown up in 
this Uchujin-Club or have at least 
had something to do with it. 

At the beginning of 1960, SF. 
Magazine, the first and only suc- 
cessful prozine in Japan, was 
brought out by the publisher of the 
Hayakawa SF Series. It started as 
a version of F&SF, but the con- 
tract was soon dissolved, and it be- 
gan to publish Japanese stories, too. 
At first they tried to have some 
of the regidar writers of other fields 
write s-f stories, but they later 
changed their policy and began to 
seek capable writers from fandom; 
and progress from Uchujin to SF 
Magazine has become the most 
orthodox route for developing wri- 
ters. Masami Fukushima (b. 1929), 
the editor of SF Magazine, is re- 
garded as a leading character in 
Japanese s-f prodom, having 
brought out both the Hayakawa SF 
Series and SF Magazine and hav- 
ing done meritorious work in rising 
the serious consideration given sci- 
ence fiction in journalism and the 
literary field. He has translated 
some U.S. and British masterpieces 
and has written many juvenile s-f 
stories also. 

Following Uchujin, several fan 
groups began to appear in 1960. 
Null-Club published NiM for 11 



30 



IE 




issues in Osaka before it folded in 
1964. SFM-Fan Club — with its 
fanzine Uchu-Kiryu (meaning space 
current) — started in Tokyo in 
1962; this is now supposed to be 
the largest fan group in Japan with 
more than 100 members, except for 
the subscription group of Vchujin. 
Most of the Japanese fanzines are 
clubzines, each supported by its 
subscription group. 

The Japanese annual s-f conven- 
tions began in 1962. The first of 
these (the Meg-Con) was a one- 
day meeting in Tokyo, sponsored 
by Uchujin Club, and it was there 
that SFM-Fan Club announced its 
start. The second convention (To- 
kon) was held in 1963 and was the 
first with a two-day program, in- 
cluding a movie-show, art-exhibi- 
tion, lodging-together and banquet, 
which made a pattern for later 
cons. The third (Daicon) was held 
in Osaka, promoted by Null Club 
and its chairman, Yasutaka Tsutsui 
(b. 1934). The fourth (Tokon-2) 
was the largest Japanese s-f con- 
vention with some 350 attending 
and was sponsored by the coopera- 
tion of Uchujin, Uchu-Kiryu and 
the SF-Art Club, which was estab- 
lished in 1963 by art fans. The 
fifth (Meicon) was held in Nagoya, 
sponsored by the Mutants Club, 
which was established in 1963 by 
Den Yoshimitsu (b. 1933) as a local 
group. The sixth (Tokon-3) was 
held in 1967 as a serious sympo- 
sium, changing the preceding pat-

tern a little, with some 180 attenS-* 
ing. We were planning to have ai 
Pan-Pacificon in 1968 in ceepera* 
tion with LASFS, having a brancU 
meeting of the Worldcon ef th^ 
year in Tokyo, but the L.A. fans 
and we lost the nomination of the! 
con-site at the Nycon-3 last au- 
tumn. 

^^he number of fanzines and fan- 
groups in Japan increase^ 
rapidly in 1965 and 1966, reaching 
50 or more, though over half of 
them were groups of juveniles. 
established the Federation ©f S-F, 
Fan Groups of Japan in 1965, which 
now consists of fourteen major fan 
groups. 

Hayakawa-Shobo’s monopoly of 
the Japanese s-f field is continuing, 
and their SF~Magazine is still th^ 
only prozine we have. In 1964 they, 
started a new series of Japanese! 
original novels and have published 
twelve by now. But a few competi- 
tors have appeared in the field of 
translated works. Tokyo-Sogensha 
Company established an s-f section 
of their Sogen Mystery Series in 
1964, which has now reached 60 
titles. They are said to have made 
very profitable sales since they be- 
gan publishing semi-classics such 
as the Burroughs and E. E. Smith 
stories. But recently some other 
publishers have begun imitating 
their practice. 

Now following are the famous 
characters in Japanese science fic- 

31 




tion, or the names most frequently 
mentioned in our fandom: 

Sakyo Komatsu (b. 1931) is a 
very active and skillful story-teller 
with wide interests; he has been 
called a bulldozer in the Japanese 
s-f field. He is also an opinion- 
shaper of Japanese futurology. He 
has written nearly twenty books 
and is supposed to be a Japanese 
version of R. A. Heinlein, though he 
stresses mainly the social sciences. 
Shin’ichi Hoshi (b. 1926) has been 
writing short-short stories mainly, 
with an elegant sense of fable criti- 
cism, and his published more than 
ten collections of his works. He was 
one of my closest associates when 
I publish^ Uchufin ori^nally; he 
soon became a profesaonal writer. 
He helped to popularize the name 
“SF” in the early days of Japanese 
science fiction. 

Kimifusa Abe (b. 1925) and the 
above two are a trio who have 
achieved popularity beyond the 
limits of sdence fiction. Abe wrote 
a few s-f stories, but is essentially 
a writer of mainstream literature, 
writing critical-fantasies and dra- 
mas based on his social beliefs. 

Yasutaka Tsutsui started as a 
pro writer after folding his fan- 
zine, NtM, and is now following 
the above three with his xmique 
satirical and comic situation fan- 
tasies, though some rigorous fans 
would not consider his stories to 
be science fiction. Ryu Mitsuse 
(b. 1928) is, on the contrary, 

32 



writing stories with hard-sdence 
form and poetic insight that make 
it seem that he intends to be a sd- 
entific Homer discusdng future 
.history. Taku Ma 3 rumura (b. 1934)] 
writes of the sodety of the com- 
paratively near ffiture for the most 
part, and he is regarded as the 
most serious writer in Japanese sd- 
ence fiction. 

Masao Segawa (b. 1931) is writ- 
ing stories and artides for juven- 
iles and is noted for the excellent 
sdentific research in his work. 
Tetsu Yano (b. 1923) has been 
famous as the first S-F Fan in 
Japan dnce the dawn of our fan- 
dom and is now a professional 
translator and also a writer of ju- 
venile s-f stories. These two, with 
Masami Fukushima, are repre- 
sentative names in Japanese ju- 
venile sdence fiction. 

In the field of s-f comics for 
juveniles, Osamu Tezuka (b. 1926) 
is the top name. He is not a spe- 
dalist in sf, but his feeling is 
rather more stfish than any other 
s-f writers in Japan. He is con- 
sidered a sort of Walt Disney, 
having produced the first animated 
film series for TV in Japan — 
Astroboy. Many other young com- 
ic artists as Sbotaro Ishimori (b. 
1938) are foUowing Tezuka, and 
it is certain that the level of s-f 
comics is rather higher and stea- 
dier than that of juvenile s-f sto- 
ries in Japan. 

Aritsune Toyoda (b. 1938) 



IF 




writes clever stories and is doing 
more — and perhaps rather better 
— work in juvenile fiction and 
scenarios for comics. His leading 
competitor is Kazumasa Hirai (b. 
1938) whose stories are esthetic 
rather than technical. Alan Kiodo- 
mari (b. 1912) was a fantasy 
writer in the general literary field 
and has worked his way over to sci- 
ence fiction. He is a good story- 
teller, but most of his living is 
made from juvenile stories. (This 
applies more or less to most s-f 
writers; juvenile magazines publish 
a far larger quantity of science 
fiction than the adult market.) 

Fujio Ishiwara (b. 1933) is not 
a full-time writer, but is a leader 
in the skillful execution of recent 
theories of science and technology. 
He maintains a high level of ac- 
tivity in fandom, too. Koichiro 
Noda (b. 1933) and Norio Itoh 
(b. 1942) are respected as excellent 
fans and have translated and in- 
troduced foreign stories. Each 
writes a column for SF-Magazine. 
Noda is expert on semi-classics 
and Itoh on more recent fiction. 
Once classed with the above two, 
Yu Mori (b. 1937) is now in 
prodom as the assistant editor 
of SF Magazine, Ichiro Kano 
(b. 1928) and Tadashi Hirose 
(b. 1924) are two professional 



writers who often do science fic^ 
tion but are also good fans anil 
help us especially on the annual 
conventions. 

Among many professional trans-< 
lators. Noriyoshi Saito (b. 1905)] 
and Hisashi Asakura (b. 1930) arci 
noted as specialists in sf. Saite #ncci 
translated Hoshi’s story into Eng- 
lish for F&SF. 

Takashi Ishikawa (b. 1930) is ^ 
critic of mystery and s-f stories — > 
the only person writing criticism 
of sf professionally. 

There are still many more talent- 
ed individuals here, both in iwro- 
dom and fandom. Some are prot 
writers who sometimes write fOod[ 
s-f stories, and others are now writ- 
ing only for the fanzines. I su^^tsti 
a considerable number of nami^ 
mentioned above will have to Iki 
replaced with others in a few years, 
when our juvenile or student fans 

— now doing their work for 
fanzines with rather poor printing 

— grow up into their fuller ai> 
complishment. They are being 
brought up in an active s-f field, 
contrary to us adult fans (wbidf 
includes most of the pro writers) 
who had to create or import the! 
modern type of science fiction for, 
ourselves in order to enjoy it,

H is name was Joseph. He was a 
blue-eyed blond and just a little 
bald in fronts although a fuzz over 
his round forehead gave a promise 
of new hair still to come. He was 
healthy, weighed twenty-two pounds 
and was barely eight months old. He 
wore diapers and rubber pants, 
nothing else. 



At the moment, he had a very 
intent expression on his smalls fat 
face. Somehow, the brightly colored 
plastic beads on a wood-bordered wire 
frame were not doing what he want- 
ed. They simply would not come off 
the frame to be thoroughly tested by 
his four teeth for true intrinsic play- 
ability and actual baby value. It was 
very unsatisfactory. He whimpered 
silghtly and then sat up straighter, his 

34

FINLAY 



creased, plump legs assuming what 
looked like a Yoga position as they 
curled in front of him. A little si^ 
almost inaudible, but weaiy, escaped 
him. It did not sound like a baby 
noise at all, but rather like the wistful 
regret of an aged man, brooding over 
the many mistakes of a long life. 
Babies make strange noises at times. 

Joseph abandoned the beads to 
survey his domain out of roimd, co- 
balt eyes, thumb in mouth. The room 
was circular, dome-shaped and about 
twenty feet across. Soft white pad- 
ding, spotlessly clean, covered the 
floor on which Joseph sat and ran 
up the gradually curving walls to a 
height of four feet. Above the edge 
of the padded covering, smooth dark 
metal, non-reflecting, rose to the top 
of the igloo-shaped room. Light, soft 
and lambent, flooded in from a 
round opening in the center of the 
dome, thirty feet over the middle of 
the room. Square black openings 
were spaced at regular intervals on 
the walls at a height of six feet. 
They gave back the blankest of mir- 
rors where the li^t hit them, and 
the baby paid no attention to them. 
He now had located and seized a 
toge, floppy, green dog among the 
simple playt^gs which lay about him 
on the floor. Staring absently off into 
some far distance, he held the cloth 
dog firmly in his chubby hands and 
began to gnaw reflectively on one of 
its tattered ears. Inside his small body, 
chemical warnings were starting to 
send an alert throughout his system. 
Dinner time was approaching. 

Even as Joseph chewed on the 
dog’s ear, his whole attitude was be- 
ginning to change. He was now 



watching only one section of the wall, 
a section which he had learned to 
keep an eye on, although it differed 
in no way from any other to a casual 
observer. Joseph stared at this par- 
ticular part of the wall more eagerly 
now, and the green dog was dropped 
and abandoned. The child actually 
could hear nothing but the soft, al- 
most inaudible hissing of the hidden 
air ducts, but his own body gave him 
a clock without compare, a timer 
provided by nature. The graduated 
intensity of the light in the room 
was an unnecessary assistance. Joseph 
knew it was noon. 

H is eyes widened in pleasure, and 
he held out his small, plump 
arms in what was obviously a gesture 
of welcome, combined with an in- 
voluntary plea. 

Soundless, an opening the size of 
a standard door had appeared in the 
section of the wall he was facing. 
Framed in it stood a massive figure, 
six feet tall, which advanced slowly 
with a faint humming noise toward 
the eager baby, who now crowed 
with pleasure. Behind the figure, the 
opening in the wall closed as silently 
as it had appeared — with one dif- 
ference, that is. From the figure a 
six-inch thick, shining cable led back 
through the wall, fitting a circular 
hole in the base of where the orig- 
inal door had appeared with micro- 
meter smoothness. 

A rich, warm voice broke the 
room’s silence and two long arms 
reached down to gather up Joseph, 
who was now panting inaudibly and 
squirming and wiggling with pleasure. 
“Baby, hungry? Joseph hungry?

Here’s the bottle. Love. Easy now, 
don’t try and drink it all at once. 
There’s still din-din. Mashed lamb 
and carrots coming, you know.” 

His blue eyes h^ closed, Joseph 
lay back in the warm, padd^ clo^- 
covered arms and inh^ed his milk 
with mighty slurps and gurgles. While 
he drank and sucked on the bottle’s 
nipple, he looked up with content- 
ment at the immobile pink and white 
plastic mask and the blue, glassined 
eyes. As he continued his meal, the 
tapes played steadily, reeling off coo- 
ings and murmurs, loving gurgles and 
bits of lullaby with programmed pre- 
cision. The pre-set warmth of the cir- 
cuits in arms and breast reassured 
the baby and the duraluminum limbs 
rocked him ever so gently. 

Joseph belched and then continued 
to drink. All was well. Mother had 
come again. She always did. 

n 

B rigadier General Albert Hardwick 
was thin, brown-eyed and a 
bachelor, young for his rank at 
thirty-eight. The fact that he. was a 
deputy-Director of G-2, Army In- 
telligence, and had been promoted 
to General’s rank while serving in 
that capacity as a full colonel, made 
him even more of an anomaly. As 
he drove, he mused over these facts 
and others, while keeping a sharp 
eye on the road. 

Only a superb combat record in 
Viet Nam and the acquisition of the 
Distinguished Service Cross and a 
Purple Heart with two clusters had 
warded off the mutterings within the 
inner circles of command. An M.A. 



in Political Science, earned while re- 
covering from wounds, was distinct- 
ly not regarded as an asset in some 
eyes, some rather senior eyes indeed. 
Hardwick had gone as an undergrad- 
uate to Michigan State and entered 
the Army through R.O.T.C. A good 
school, Michigan State, fine Ameri- 
can institution. Still, not the Point, 
though, was it now? And a general 
at thirty-eight! 

Hardwick drove steadily on 
through the flat countryside of 
southeastern New Jersey. He was not 
worried about the nullings higher 
up. He had faced them before when 
it came to a crisis point, and his 
record had always been more than 
enough — his record plus a few 
seniors of vejy high rank who cared 
nothing for mutterings and valued 
performance alone. 

Cruising along through the un- 
ending scrub pines of the Jersey 
Barrens, illumined by a hazy Sep- 
tember afternoon sun, Hardwick was 
not really concerned with military 
hierarchy. At the moment, the 
machinery of his mind was locked 
in on his present assignment, which 
presented enough puzzles for a decade 
of musing. 

He had been working very hard 
of late. As head of G-2’s Chinese 
desk, he had to co-ordinate with the 
C.I.A., the Navy, the Air Force and 
the whole network of Defense De- 
partment Intelligence. As the Far 
Eastern landmass gave birth to one 
confrontation after another in a grim 
and mounting progression, his task 
grew worse by the week. 

The Chinese takeover of Burma 
in 1974, two years earlier, had been 



DEATHCHILD 



37 




awesome in its smoothness and pre- 
cision. Burma had gone lock, stock 
and barrel into the Chinese camp, al- 
beit on a privileged and semi-indepen- 
dent basis, led by its own neutralist 
rulers in a calculated gamble. The 
opposition leaders, including a former 
Secretary of the U.N., had been 
liquidate by their own secret police 
overnight, with Chinese assistance 
when necessary. In something like a 
week, Burma was solidly Peking com- 
munist, from Rangoon to the Kachin 
hills. 

Everyone, includmg the Russians, 
had been caught napping. 

F or the next two years, a relentless 
dual pressure had been grinding 
at India to the West and Thailand 
to the East. Well fed on Burmese 
rice and led by professionals, the 
Chinese Armies, their proletarian 
militia outlook totally discarded 
since the counter-purge of 1968, 
were now armed with the latest weap- 
ons. And they were firmly based on 
all their perimeters, facing out from 
every point of the compass. The 
Russian relinquishment of Outer 
Mongolia to Chinese Influence was 
now a year old. The long moribund 
Viet Cong had re-emerged in strength 
and American troops were again en- 
gaged in full scale war from the 
South China Sea to the Thai-Burmese 
border, and not winning either. A 
strongly hostile note had intruded 
into U.S.-Japanese relations, and 
Japan’s government was pursuing a 
cold and distant attitude to United 
States overtures. And a month ago, 
two well-armed, well-led Hukbalahap 
corps had erupted overnight from 



the mountains of Western Luzon and 
attacked the Philippine Army in open 
and initially successful battle. Naval 
intelligence reports on a vast new 
fleet of Chinese nuclear-powered 
subs, mostly cargo and troop carriers, 
were pouring in. Everything, in short, 
was blowing up. 

Why in hell, for the fiftieth time 
thought Hardwick as he drove, take 
a top man who is working a fifteen- 
hour day away from his job at the 
Pentagon and shove him out in the 
boondocks? Security Chief of Project 
Inside Straight, whatever that wasl 
Super Q Clearance! No written or- 
ders! Unscheduled personal interview 
for assignment with the Secretary of 
Defense! Interview consisting of 
route information to Point Nowhere 
in Southern New Jersey, period. End 
of interview. Get on your civvies 
and go, man. He had gone. 

The pine shadows were now dark- 
ening the narrow country road ahead. 
Hardwick spared a glance at his 
watch. Six-thirty. He braked as the 
road straggled lazily into a small 
clearing and a meaningless crossroads. 
A small wooden shack in front of 
which leaned a rusting gas pump, 
grayish hose in tatters, stood at one 
side of the road. Three broken win- 
dows leered over a sagging porch 
railing. 

As Hardwick looked around, his 
eye caught a flicker of movement 
and a glin t of metal at the left 
window, gone as soon as registered. 
His hands tightened on the Chevy’s 
wheel, but his gaze swept calmly on. 
Menit^y, he considered the memo- 
rized travel plan and came to a de- 
cision.

IF 




T he small black car, an incon- 
spicuous, two-year-old electro- 
compact, took the road opening to 
the left, away from the shack, and 
Hardwick drove on, his mind racing. 
His whole life from combat in Asia 
to the present had alerted him to be 
wary of observation, and for the last 
ten miles he was aware that he had 
been steadily watched. The few farm 
houses, the dark scrubby pines and 
green thickets, the empty roadside 
stands, the occasional battered trucks 
— all, he knew, had contained sleep- 
less eyes. Whatever Project Inside 
Straight was, someone wanted the 
word sealed in. 

Again he recalled the precise tone 
of Secretary of Defense Madden 
when outlining his route. Hardwick’s 
hands again tightened on the wheel. 
•Now, he felt a certainty that any de- 
viation from the route he had been 
ordered to follow would meet with 
unpleasant results, results he would 
have no time to question! 

The road at this point ceased to 
be even second-class and was no 
longer tar but plain dirt and sand. 
What kind of installation could this 
be? Hardwick cursed softly as he 
switched on the car’s lights. He had 
seen no signs on the road of any 
vehicular traffic at all, and the road 
itself was in appalling shape. How 
did supplies and personnel get in 
or out? He steered around a large 
pothole, his right fender scraping in- 
to a tangle of blueberry bushes as 
he did so. It was suddenly almost 
full dark outside, and the last katy- 
dids of the season had started a 
chirping audible even over the crunch 
of sand under the wheels and the 



faint hum of the battery-driven en- 
gine. 

S uddenly, the road ceased. Before 
him, as he braked sharply, the 
lights shone on black, oily water. 
The road had ended at a tiny, for- 
gotten landing on a broad creek 
winding through the Barrens. A 
rickety dock stood forlornly at road’s 
end, thrusting out ten feet into the 
stream, but that was aU. 

Hardwick switched off the engine 
and sat for exactly five seconds in 
the utter silence that followed, keep- 
ing time by staring at the sweep 
hand on his wristwatch, glowing in 
the darkness of the front seat. At the 
fifth second he opened the window 
wide and began to whistle a tune. 
It was Melancholy Baby. After pre- 
cisely fifteen seconds, he stopped 
whistling and sat very still. Not a 
sound broke the silence outside, save 
the faint eddying noise of the water 
lapping around the piers of the little 
dock. 

Then an eyebeam from a pencil 
flash hit him square in the face. Al- 
though he had heard no whisper of 
movement, he saw that someone 
was now standing next to his win- 
dow. 

“General Hardwick?” came a 
pleasant soft voice. 

Feeling slightly ridiculous, he 
answered, “Aces over Eights.” 

“The Dead Man’s Hand,” said the 
voice approvingly. With that, a spray 
with an unfamiliar, sweet, pungent 
odor lanced in the window and 
settled over Hardwick’s face in a 
cloud. He barely had time to won- 
der what was going on when the 



DEATHCHILD 



39 




powerful anaesthetic knocked him out 
for the count-'The trip was over as 
far as any volition on his part was 
concerned. 

lU 

H e awoke suddenly and sat up in 
bed, memory returning with a 
rush. He saw that he was wearing 
comfortable pajamas. Looking around 
the small room, he noted first a uni- 
form of his own rank with all of 
his correct decorations hanging on a 
hanger from a wall hook. Under it 
on the floor lay shoes and socks, 
both O.D., and a single-starred cap 
straddled the hook. 

He realized that he felt fine and 
got out of bed and stretched, still 
eyeing his surroundings. The drably- 
painted room was windowless but 
the air seemed fresh. All around him 
he was conscious of the pulse of 
machines. Could this be a power 
plant of some kind? One of the two 
visible doors opened on inspection 
into a tiny shower-bathroom; the oth- 
er, he guessed a hall door, was lock- 
ed. What seemed to be all of his 
personal possessions lay neatly on 
top of a bureau near his uniform. 
Curious, he opened the bureau 
drawers and found a complete sup- 
ply of O.D. underwear, shirts, hand- 
kerchiefs and such, all in his size. 
He seemed to be booked in for quite 
a stay. 

At this point a bell pealed gently 
high on one wall, and a voice came 
from a hidden speaker apparently 
concealed in the central light fixture 
on the ceiling. 

“Please shave and dress, General. 



You will have visitors in exactly 
fifteen minutes.” There was a 
pause. “Repeat,” said the voice, 
“Fifteen minutes.” There was an 
audible click. 

He stood with his hands behind 
him exactly fifteen minutes later, fuU- 
uniformed, and saw the locked door 
open. Outwardly calm but extremely 
annoyed within, he watched two peo- 
ple come in and close the door. 

I n front was a woman, which sur- 
prised him, although his face 
stayed expressionless. Women do not 
normally achieve high rank in maxi- 
mum Security operations. She was 
about five-seven, with brown hair 
and eyes, quite good-looking without 
being a raging beauty. Her eyes were 
sharp and very intelligent Hardwick 
guessed her age at about thirty-four 
and was surprised later on to find she 
was four years younger. She was 
wearing a well-cut brown suit and 
no jewelery. 

The gray-haired man who stood 
quietly in back of her also sur|Mrised 
him, but for different reasons, and 
his impatient anger stopped mount- 
ing right there and then. 

He had not seen Thomas B. Al- 
len for over two years, but the mus- 
tached C.I.A. senior field agent, who 
somewhat resembled a caricature of 
Dr. Watson, was a man whom he 
respected anywhere or at any time. 
If Tom Allen was in this strange af- 
fair, he had better keep quiet and 
see what happened. 

The woman looked at him for a 
moment and then came forward, 
hand outstretched and a smile on her 
face.

IF 




“General, you look like a man 
who needs an apology. 1 have noth- 
ing to apologize for and neither 
does Mr. Allen, but we apologize 
anyway. I’m Dr. Joanne Buder, the 
Technical Director of Inside Straight, 
and Mr. Allen, whom you alre^y 
know, is the Security Director. Be- 
tween us, we’ve been running things 
here. You’re our new boss.” 

Mechanically, Hardwick shook 
hands with the woman, then with 
Allen, while trying to grasp this last 
sentence. His face must have relaxed 
and revealed some emotion, because 
Dr. Butler laughed, a sound Hard- 
wick absently noted as low and 
pleasant. 

“I’m not going to stay,” she said. 
“Mr. Allen will fill you in, and later 
we can go further into the job. I’ll 
simply say that all three of us are 
here at ^e direct — and in my 
case personal — request of the Presi- 
dent. We’re not playing around for 
the fun of it.” 

“I never thought we were,” said 
Hardwick, flushing slightly. 

“I know,” she said. “But I wanted 
to make it plainer still. This is the 
biggest thing you’ve ever touched. 
General. Nothing and nobody must 
stand in its way. Too much has al- 
ready been sacri . has been done, 
by everyone, for this to fail. Do 
you understand me?” 

P uzzled at the sudden break in her 
otherwise calm voice, Hardwick 
merely nodded. She had been about 
to say “sacrificed” and had changed 
her mind, of that he was certain. 

“Good,” she said, her efficient 
manner apparently restored. “I’ll see 



you later then when Torn brings you 
along. Bear with us until you know 
the whole story. You have an even 
tougher job than ours coming up.” 

After the door closed behind her, 
the silent Allen seated himself in 
the room’s one chair and pulled out 
a horrible-looking old pipe which he 
lit while surveying Hardwick from 
opaque gjray eyes. He waved a hand 
at the bed, and Hardwick sat down 
on its edge while his mind went 
racing back into what he knew about 
Allen. Allen was the man who, as a 
young agent, had broken the Mos- 
sadegh government of Iran almost 
single-handed and then gone on from 
strength to strength, until nowadays 
he practically wrote his own orders. 
His brown suit and scuffed shoes, 
plus the gray, bristly mustache made 
him look like an out-of-tenure, ab- 
sent-minded professor at some 
Eastern college, but Hardwick knew 
better. Very few people did. He 
therefore waited, with as much 
patience as he could muster. 

His pipe going, Allen finally lean- 
ed back and spoke. 

“You’re looking well. General, but 
pale. The pressure getting pretty 
heavy back at the ranch?” 

“I don’t imagine that you’re cut 
off from news here, Mr. Allen,” he 
answered. “The roof is falling in aU 
over, in every way.” 

“Call me Tom,” said AUen, look- 
ing shrewdly at him through a cloud 
of blue smoke. “And I’ll call you 
Al.” 

“All right, Tom,” said Hardwick. 
“We’ll be pals, even chums, in no 
time. Now what in hell is this weird 
business all about?” 



DEATHCHILD

“What do you remember reading 
or hearing about the Houston Gen- 
eral Hospital disaster?” Allen asked 
suddenly, still watching him very 
carefully. 

Hardwick thought for a second. 
This was obviously not a time for 
idle questions. 

“Yes, I remember it fairly well. 
Some volatile poisonous gas or some- 
thing got into the central air ducts, 
and the whole place went blooie in 
seconds when it was ignited. The 
place was deliberately set on fire to 
destroy any traces of what was there, 
as I recall. Lot of people killed by 
the gas first. So what? It just hap- 
pened earlier this year, didn’t it? I 
was in England at the time.” 

tC^p'hat was eight months ago,” 
A said Allen almost to himself. 
He sucked noisily on bis pipe and 
exhaled a cloud of awful-smeDing 
blue smoke before continuing. His 
voice had suddenly become precise 
and metallic. 

“Because of that disaster, you were 
sent here under highest security orders 
to familiarize yourself with and take 
command of the installation in which 
you now find yourself. You were 
trailed from Washington out into the 
country, watched every yard of the 
way and then knocked out and dump- 
ed into a helicopter, which probably 
transferred you to one or two others 
on route. The only thing I can tell 
you is that you are nowhere at all, 
probably not by a thousand miles, 
near to where you last thou^t you 
were. This installation is so secret 
that probably not more than ten 
people in the wotM know its exact 



location. That includes me. 1 came 
here the same wajr you did. I think 
it’s in the continental limits of the 
U.S., guess it may be underground, 
but I’m not sure of that either. It 
could even be underwater. StiH in- 
terested?” 

“Go on,” said Hardwick, keeping 
his face impassive. 

“Okay. You are going to have to 
familiarize yourself in detail with this 
whole place. There are over a thou- 
sand personnel here, mostly n>en, all 
working as maintenance and security. 
They were all — except one — kid- 
napped and convinced later, as I was, 
that this was a job that had to be 
done. A whole lot of the place is 
simply nothing but machines and 
more machines. You can always hear 
them. Half the people here are tech- 
nicians, the other half guards. Half 
the technicians are concealed guards 
and half the guards are reserve tech- 
nicians, held in case of emergency. 
Any questions yet, or do I go on?” 

“Dr. Butler is the non-kidnappee, 
I suppose?” Hardwick asked thought- 
fully. 

“Pretty smart. Yes, she’s the one. 
A Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry. She 
and the President, or maybe the 
Secretary of Defense, grabbed the 
others, I suppose. No, don’t laugh. 
When you see what we’re guarding 
and why and understand your part 
in it, maybe you’ll believe anything. 
This place kind of gets to you.” 

Hardwick thought that if a place 
could get to Thomas Allen, on whose 
head the Soviets had once put a 
no-questions-asked price of one hun- 
dred thousand dollars, it ought to be 
worth looking at.

IF 




A llen regretfully knocked out his 
ash on a saucer from the night 
table and stuffed the pipe back in 
his pocket. 

“No smoking outside your room, 
the dining areas and lounges,” he 
said. 

“I don’t smoke,” said Hardwick. 
“Do you really believe that this place 
could be underwater?” 

“Wait until you see it,” said Allen 
^umly. “It might even be on the 
Moon. Let’s go take a look.” 

Hardwick glanced at his watch. 
It said eight o’clock. “Do I get any 
breakfast?” he asked. 

“You get anything you want, ex- 
cept Out,” answered Allen. “You’re 
the new boss, subject only to Dr. 
Butler and the Science staff in pure 
technology. I’ll walk you over to 
the cafeteria and show you what 
there is to be seen on the way. 

“Oh, yes,” he added, reaching into 
a pocket, “here’s your new badge. 
Pin it on at all times outside this 
room. This is a very trigger-happy 
place.” 

“What’s everyone so afraid of?” 
asked Hardwick, pinning on the large 
blue-metal badge. It bore inset a 
recent picture of himself that he 
didn’t remember seeing before, a lot 
of mysterious numbers and the 
words Director of Security. 

“Killing everyone in the country 
and maybe the world, I imagine,” 
said Allen flatly and opened the 
door. “After you.” 

They emerged into a narrow corri- 
dor, well lit by a continuous fluores- 
cent panel in the ceiling. The sound 
of machinery was louder now, a con- 
tinuous, muffled vibrato in the back- 



ground, not loud enough to interfere 
with speech, but rather like traffic 
noises heard from a lofty New York 
apartment 

Down the corridor they were fol- 
lowing, Hardwick saw a figure stand- 
ing. As they approached, a tall 
lounging man in blue coveralls with 
a badge on them marked Security 
straightened up and waved casually. 
He was a light-skinned Negro. 

“Jim, this is General Hardwick, 
our new boss. I’m showing him 
around. He goes anywhere, any time. 
Al, meet Jim Tableman. I don’t know 
aU the troops, but Jim was one of 
the first to arrive.” 

“Glad to see you. General,” said 
Tableman and shook hands. Hard- 
wick noticed that the left hand stayed 
in his coverall pocket. 

“Got a gun?” he asked casually. 

Like lightning, a .357 magnum 
snub nose em^ged from the pocket, 
then vanished again, all in one fluid 
motion. 

“Not bad for an M.A. in Biochem- 
istry, is it?” said Allen pleasantly. 

“Does he just stand here all day 
or all watch?” asked Hardwick, turn- 
ing to Alien. He was getting a bit 
irritated again by all the apparent 
mystery. 

“Show him what else you’re here 
for, Jim,” said Allen. “Stand still, Al, 
and don’t move. My authority, dem- 
onstration purposes, Jim.” 

IV 

H ardwick saw Tableman’s hand 
flick out to an area of wall 
which ^)peared to tthe eye no dif- 
ferent from any other. As Tableman 



DEATHCHILD 



43 




touched it, a steel panel slid out 
from the equally unmarked ceiling 
and dropped to the floor with a 
muffled thud. The corridor ahead of 
them was now totally sealed off by 
what appeared to be an air-tight, bul- 
let-proof barrier. The whole thing 
had taken less than a half-second. 

Tableman waited and at a nod from 
Allen touched the wall again. The 
steel shutter slid up as fast and as 
silently as it had come down and the 
empty corridor stretched before them 
once more. 

“Thanks, Jim. Come on, Al. We 
can talk as we walk, and you want 
breakfast.” 

“How many Jims are there?” asked 
Hardwick as they strolled along, pie 
corridor was always gently curved to 
the left, and Hardwick guessed that 
they were in a vast dome-shaped or 
circular structure of some kind, with 
many levels, both up and down. 

Allen grinned. “Do you mean 
guards, biochemists or barrier watch- 
men?” 

“Barrier watchmen, I guess.” 

“One hundred and seven. Each 
one knows his own wall section trig- 
ger, and none of them knows any 
of the others, except me and eventual- 
ly you.” 

“You’ve memorized all those sec- 
tions, all those hidden buttons?” 
asked Hardwick incredulously. 

“No great trick for a good foreign 
duty agent, my boy. I’ll teach you 
the method. You’ve been at a desk 
too long.” 

They passed other coveralled men 
and even one woman as they walked 
along. Despite his previous disclaimer, 
Allen seemed to know all of them 



by name. Occasional doors broke the 
smoothness of the corridor on both 
sides. Through one of them which 
was open, Hardwick glimpsed a lofty 
room almost filled to the ceiling with 
what looked like vast, throbbing tur- 
bines. It reminded him of a ship’s 
engine room he had once looked at. 

“Air re-conditioning boosters,” 
said Allen. “The place is filled with 
them. Well, herer we are at the res- 
taurant.” 

H e led the way through a glass- 
panelled double door, and Hard- 
wick found himself in a large, pleas- 
ant cafeteria. People of both sexes, 
all sporting identity badges on their 
coveralls, sat about in groups or 
alone. Some read while they ate; 
others talked, and a few were writing 
in pads or on sheets of paper. 

“Looks like the dining room of 
the Rand Corporation,” remarked 
Hardwick as they chose a vacant 
table and sat down. 

‘The Rand Corporation couldn’t 
get the three top cooks off the atom 
sub fleet,” was the answer. “Two 
others worked for the Waldorf. Order 
anjrthing you like. They’ve damn near 
got it” 

A pretty waitress, also in coveralls 
and badge, took their order and left. 
A few people looked at Hardwick 
and away, he noticed, and then spoke 
to one another. A steady hum of 
eating noises, crockery and conver- 
sation provided a background. The 
place could have been duplicated, 
save for clothes, at any number of 
science establishments he had vis- 
ited at one time or another. 
Hardwick asked few questions 

IF 



44 




when the food arrived He had or- 
dered breakfast without thinking very 
hard, but the food was excellent, the 
eggs and bacon being exactly as he 
had specified. Over his second cup of 
very good coffee he again began to 
question Allen, who had been equal- 
ly silent while eating. 

“What next, Tom?” 

“You get to see Dr. Butler — that 
is, after seeing the reason why we’re 
here at all. That can be done on the 
way to her office. You’ll understand 
a lot better what’s going on if you 
see that first.” 

Finishing his coffee, Hardwick 
rose and followed Allen out of the 
noise and into the seemingly endless 
corridor outside. 

They had only passed a couple of 
guards when Allen stopped at a blank 
door and gestured to Hardwick to 
stand beside him. Apparently there 
was some sort of scanning device 
in the featureless metal door, because 
it slid back at once into a grooved 
opening. Beyond the opening, a guard 
waved them forward into yet another 
corridor, but this time set at ri^t 
angles to the first. 

“How can every guard know 
everyone here?” asked Hardwick as 
he followed Allen on. 

“They don’t,” was the answer. “In 
each sp^ied area, only certain peo- 
ple of the whole population have any 
business. Anyone else doesn’t get in; 
and if he tried, a report would go in 
to security center at once. Very fast 
action follows. I go anywhere, and 
so does anyone with me, of course.” 

T hey entered other doors, passed 
other guards, at one point used 



a ramp and at another, an elevator. 
It all seemed confusing to Hardwkk, 
and he realized that it would be 
equally confusing to anyone who 
tried to penetrate the place from out- 
side and managed to get past the 
outer guards. 

“What’s the level of education 
here if an M.A. in Biochemistry is a 
guard?” he asked, a bit further on. 
^ “I have a B.A. in journalism from 
Connecticut,” said Alien, “and I must 
be at the bottom of the ladder.” 

“Then this place was all actually 
built by these brains, if I understand 
you correctly, and they’re now all 
cheerfully doing guard and mainten- 
ance work as a result?” 

“I came late,” was Allen’s reply, 
“but they even had me doing some 
electrical wiring. The whole place 
was built in one and a half months, 
starting with the Center. The first 
work was done entirely in space 
suits, around the center dome, but 
we’re not in space, despite what I 
said earlier. Anot^ minute and 
you’ll see something. This is the last 
checkpoint.” 

They stopped before still another 
featureless door. When it slid open, 
it revealed a metal desk and two 
more blue-coveralled men just inside, 
one seated behind the desk, one 
standing. They both nodded affably 
as Allen disgorged a short-barrelled 
Smith and Wesson .38, a German 
Fallschirmjager knife and a set of 
C.I.A. picklocks on to the desktop. 
Then he waited with arms raised as 
the standing man went over him in 
a thorough frisk. 

“You too, Al,” he- said. “These 
particular boys have orders to let only 



DEATHCHILD 



45 




certain people, of whom you are now 
one, in here. But no one goes in un- 
searched, ever, including Dr. Butler. 
That’s a house rule.” 

Hardwick was searched in turn 
and a small pocket knife was added 
to the pile on the desk. 

“You see,” continued Allen, “this 
is the inner circle. There are no 
guards from mow on, only a few 
monitors and technicians. Everything 
that needs doing from here on could 
be done by robots and servomecha- 
nisms in an emergency, with the rest 
of the place sealed off completely. 
This last check is one against plain 
and simple lunacy. 1 could do a little 
damage here with my bare hands, 
but not much. So I give up the 
arsenal and pick it up on the way 
out.” 

T) y this time, they had left a short 
-D corridor and were now in a 
circular one, into which the first 
had led. A curve, like that of a 
rounded dome, made up one wall, as 
if the corridor in which they stood 
were circling a giant sphere. Near 
where the two had paused, a woman 
in a white lab coat was staring 
through a square glassed port in the 
dome wall. Her back was to the two 
men, but as they walked over, Hard- 
wick was not surprised to see Dr. 
Butler turn and face them. 

“I wanted to see your reaction. 
General,” she said, unsmiling. “I have 
few diversions these days, and this is 
one of them. Come and meet the 
ruler of the world.” 

Hardwick walked to the inch-thick 
window and looked in and down. 

On the padded white floor below 



him, Joseph was having his morning 
nap. As Hardwick watched in amaze- 
ment, he stirred in his sleq> and a 
small pink thumb found its way to 
the cupid’s-bow mouth. 

Still unable to comprehend what 
he saw, Hardwick stared down at 
the sleeping baby for another minute 
and then turned back to stare in 
equal amazement at the oth^: man 
and the woman who were watching 
him. In their eyes he saw a serious- 
ness which left him no room for 
doubt. And in the woman’s expres- 
sion, Hardwick sensed a terrible pain, 
a pain which no man could ever feel. 

There was a moment of silence 
as the three looked at each ether 
and then Allen grunted. 

“Come on back to Joanne’s office 
with us. You’ve just seen Jo^ph, the 
most dangerous creature mi earth. 
Now, you really need informatien! 
Your own mission, Al, is now start- 
ing, and you have a lot to learn.” 

V 

E xactly five weeks later to the day 
— rather the night — Hard- 
wick stood on the sloping deck of 
the United States Polaris sub 
Anthony Wayne and spoke quietly 
with a group of his fellow pass^gers. 

Around the ship, little waves 
lapped at the hull, and in the near 
distance a muffled roar proclaimed 
surf breaking over the outer reef of 
a small atoll. The warm ni^ air of 
the South Pacific flowed over the 
immobile submarine, and a blaze of 
stars in the black sky shed almest 
as much light as a northern moon 
at full.

Hardwick was exchanging idle talk 
with a tall gray-haired navel officer 
when the latter was called away by 
a voice from the next group forward. 

“How much longer, Admiral? 
Isn’t it time yet?” 

“They’re late now. Sir,” was the 
answer. “We expected that. Sonar 
and radar report them out there, 
snooping around. Probably a matter 
of face, making us wait. We have 
orders to stay here for two hours, 
unless there’s a counter order from 
Pearl.” 

A low call from the top of the 
submarine’s towering mast sent the 
admiral hurrying over. The civilian 
to whom he had been speaking 
moved along the deck to where Hard- 
wick was standing gazing out to sea. 
“Think they’re coming. General?” 
“Mr. Secretary, I hope to God 
they’re coming.” Hardwick tried to 
read Defense Secretary Madden’s ex- 
pression by the tropic starlight, but 
the eyes in the pale face were simply 
pools of shadow. 

“They said they’d come,” he went 
on. “Their ambassador in Warsaw 
guaranteed all the arrangements. I 
think they’ll come. What in heU have 
they got to lose?” 

The tall figure of the admiral had 
returned, and he now reported to the 
Secretary. 

“The instruments say a big sub is 
heading away from the pack out 
there and moving straight in at ten 
knots. I think you’d better get ready.” 
“I have my overnight bag and 
here’s Chief Justice Reeves with his. 
Nothing left to do but for us to thank 
you for the trip. Good luck to all 
you gentlemen.” 



“Good luck to you, Sir, and you, 
too, Mr. Chief Justice. Hope to see 
you soon.” 

H ardwick continued to watch with 
attention when a little later, the 
squatter, more massive form of the 
Red Chinese atom sub moved along- 
side the Wayne. You never knew 
what tiny detail would come in handy 
in intelligence work. He had seen 
pictures of the new enemy vessels 
before but the real thing was awe- 
inspiring, considering that the Chi- 
nese navy of fifteen years earlier had 
been mostly P.T. boats and wooden 
minesweepers. 

He was at the head of the gang- 
way when the Chinese delegation ap- 
peared and he saluted them formally. 
The three uniformed members of the 
body saluted in return, albeit stiffly. 
The five civilians simply ignored him 
and walked on past to the deck of 
the U.S. vessel. Two officers motion- 
ed them to follow, and they all went 
below decks. Hardwick continued to 
watch the other vessel. 

He watched the Chief Justice and 
the Secretary of Defense of the 
United States and their two aides 
enter the hatch of the enemy sub, 
now cast off, and then the hatch 
close. The great ship moved off at 
once, heading out to sea to join the 
invisible armada which had accom- 
panied it. When it had vanished from 
sight, he went below to meet the 
newly arrived passengers. 

TTiey were standing about in the 
special lounge which had been fitted 
out for them, faces immobile, not 
even talking, when he entered. He 
closed the hatch behind him and

IF 




moved to the center of the cabin, 
v/hi\Q they all turned to stare at him. 

“Good evening, Gentlemen,” he 
said, speaking in impeccable Man- 
darin. “I am Brigadier General Hard- 
wick of the American army, your 
host for the duration of this journey, 
until you are returned to your com- 
patriots. Please let me know of any- 
thing which I can do to serve you. 
Any questions you have will be 
answered to the best of my ability, 
barring certain matters of security, 
of course. May I know your names? 
Do you wish tea?” 

S ixteen dark eyes regarded him im- 
placably. But it was obvious that 
someone had to speak, and the senior 
officer, a gaunt man who wore the 
gold and red rank badges of a Mar- 
shal of the Chinese People’s Army 
on his immaculate khakis stepped a 
pace forward. 

‘Tea will be welcome. General. I 
am Marshal Sun Lo Jen, chief of 
this delegation. My .companions in 
the service are Generals Wu Sen 
Fang and Li Peng, who command 
respectively the Sixth and Eighth 
Armies of the People’s Defense 
Force. 

“These other colleagues are Drs. 
Kai Li Po and Chang Hsien of our 
Central Medical Bureau and Drs. 
Feng Hsi Liang and Kuo Tai Min 
of the People’s Ministry of Defense, 
Chemical and Bacteriolo^cal Di- 
vision.” 

“I am honored to meet all of 
you,” said Hardwick politely. “Es- 
pecially General Wu Sen Fang, who 
so closely resembles another officer. 
General Lo Jui Chen, the recently 



appointed Director of all the Com- 
bined Security Services of the Chinese 
Petrie’s Republic.” 

“I in turn am flattered by yeur 
attention,” said the now unma^ed 
head of all the Chinese intelligence 
and police forces. He was a 
powerful man with an oval face, high 
cheek bones and close-cropped, Mack 
hair who smiled politely at Hardwick. 

“We in turn are honored to have a 
Deputy Director of U.S. Army In- 
telligence serve as our guide,” he 
cmitinued in very fair Engli^ 

Hardwick nodded. Point and ri- 
poste! 

“Here’s the tea and some sand- 
wiches,” he said as the door opened 
to admit a parade of tray-bearing 
stewards. “If any of you would rather 
go straight to bed, I can have you 
shown your quarters. We’ll ren^- 
vous with our carrier at about eight 
o’clock tomorrow morning.” 

“I think we would all like a little 
talk first,” said Lo Jui Chen, who 
appeared to be quite undiscomfited 
by the disclosure of his identity. Al- 
though militarily ranked by the 
Marshal, he was a member of the 
Chinese Politbureau and far more 
important a man. Since he could not 
have hoped to deceive U.S. intelli- 
gence, the name change must have 
been for internal Chinese consump- 
tion, thought Hardwick to himself. 
There must still be power plays going 
on back home in Peking, then. 

“There is no point in wasting 
time in foolishness,” continued Gen- 
eral Lo. He had reverted to Chinese, 
which made Hardwick sure he want- 
ed his associates to understand per- 
fectly what he was saying.

“Where are we going, if it is not 
too much to ask?** 

“We are going, as I mentioned 
earlier, to meet a carrier,” said Hard- 
wick. “Why don’t we all sit down 
for a moment, and I’ll sketch the 
trip?” 

H e waited until the eight Orientals 
had seated themselves in a semi- 
circle around his own chair and were 
sipping their tea before going on. 

“From the carrier we will fly to 
the States, board a sealed helicopter 
and go to an unnamed installation. 
In that installation, whose exact lo- 
cation I don’t know myself, by the 
way, you will be shown certain things 
and allowed to move about wher- 
ever you wish. You will be accorded 
free use of laboratories and equip- 
ment to make any tests you desire. I 
saw, from the cases you brought 
along, that a great deal of testing 
equipment was included in your bag- 
gage. That’s fine as far as we are 
concerned. You will be given every 
facility to use it. I must, however, 
tell you that you will be rigorously 
searched and so will your baggage 
before arriving at the site. No com- 
munications devices or electronic 
homers of any kind will be permitted. 

“You will be shown quarters at 
your destination which you may or 
may not believe to be free from bugs 
or observation. Anything of that na- 
ture you find you are welcome to 
destroy. 

“At the end of seven days or even 
longer, as pre-arranged with your 
government, you will be allowed to 
leave the way you came. You will be 
expected to send one uncoded signal 



authorizing the re-exchange of Chief 
Justice Reeves and Secretary Mad- 
den at this same rendezvous. Are 
there any other questions?” 

“I have so many that they would 
be completely pointless,” replied 
General Lo coldly, “and I imagine 
my companions feel equally curious. 
To be frank, which you Caucasians 
consider a virtue, I believe neither 
in any of this fantastic story of a 
world-destroying weapon nor in even 
one of your assurances. I am obey- 
ing orders, however, and there is no 
more to be said. We would prefer 
to be left alone as much as possible. 
Perhaps we may be informed of the 
meal times and rest periods? Other- 
wise, we would wish to have as little 
as possible contact with your person- 
nel, and certainly none of a social 
nature.” 

“As you wish, gentlemen,” said 
Hardwick. “I will say ‘Goodnight* 
in that case. You can reach me at 
any hour if you want something.” 
He bowed and left. 

VI 

4 c'^hey’ll be here in half an hour, 
JL Joanne,” said Tom Allen to 
Dr. Butler. She merely looked at her 
watch and said nothing. 

A week had passed since a sealed 
helicopter had brought Hardwick 
and the eight Chinese by night to 
the landing area of Project Inside 
Straight, which Hardwick was now 
fairly sure was under a mountain, 
somewhere in the far West of the 
United States. 

The three, though Allen least of 
all, betrayed the strain of the past 

IF 



50 




week by abrupt, staccato speech and 
nervous tension, try though they 
might to control it. Now, as they 
waited in the small auditorium for 
the Chinese to arrive for a final 
briefing and question period, they 
found it hard to sustain conversation. 

“Tom,” said Hardwick abruptly, 
“can you offer any opinion on what 
their reaction has been? I’m supposed 
to be an expert on Chinese affairs, 
but I’ve never pretended that my 
knowledge wasn’t mostly theory. 
I’ve always felt that the Defense 
Department people in the field were 
miles behind you C.I.A. types in that 
kind of training and in getting under 
the skin of an alien thinker.” 

Allen gnawed meditatively on his 
unlit pipe for a second before answer- 
ing. 

“Hard to say, pal. I haven’t been 
eyeball to eyeball with these guys 
since the last Khamba uprising in 
Tibet, and that was quite a few years 
back. They certainly sent their top 
spooks. I’ll say that, especially Gen- 
eral Lo. He expressed great regrets 
that my wife had died last year, by 
the way, and most of the people on 
our own team never even knew 1 
had one. Wise bastard!” 

He went on. “Well. I think they’re 
edgy. Lord, why wouldn’t they be? 
You both know all the daily tests we 
run on Joseph. They ran tiieir own, 
and they all checked out, just as we 
knew iey would. The one freak 
chance of a foulup would have been 
for him to lose his weird potential, 
maybe due to some obscure hormone 
or glandular change. I mean ri^t 
while they were here, actually testing 
him, and that isn’t likely or possible." 



He snorted and waved his pipe. 

“They’re not crazy people, so I 
guess they must be scared. Hell, we* re 
scared and we live with it day in, 
day out.” 

H ardwick looked over at Joanne 
Butler. Her expression, normal- 
ly calm and impassive, was now, to 
his trained eye, getting a bit frayed 
at the edges. He felt again a quick 
moment of tragic empathy with this 
good-looking, quiet woman who had 
charge of so much grief and awe- 
some power and who had carried 
the responsibility so well and brave- 

ly- 

She sensed him looking at her and 
smiled briefly as she looked up, her 
face softening for a moment into 
that of a young girl. He had never 
known a woman who affected him 
this way, thought Hardwick. He 
had always considered himself a 
hopeless bachelor, a man who had 
found passion at rare and fleeting mo- 
ments and then gone on back to his 
work. But now he felt a daily, almost 
hourly, surge of protectiveness toward 
Joanne and was detached enough to 
know what it meant. 

Another thought also jogged his 
mind before he buried it forcefully. 
As the top boss of Inside Straight, 
he had, for the past month, spent 
many hours in going through the 
massive and voluminous personnel 
files. There, he had encountered al- 
most in passing a tiny bit of informa- 
tion, something which had set him to 
thinVifig hard. He had been inclined 
to tell Allen when the first bizarre 
thought had stirred in his mind, but 
had not done so, and now he was 



DEATHCHILD 



51 




glad. He suppressed the unbidden 
thought firmly and smiled back at 
Joanne as warmly as he could, con- 
scious that the strain must be as 
visible on his face as it was on hers. 

“It’s ten forty-four, and they’ll be 
here any second,” said Allen. “Any 
last minute ideas?” 

“We’ve said it all,” the woman 
answered. “All we can do is let A1 
give his little speech and wait for 
questions.” 

•As she spoke, a door at the far 
end of the auditorium opened and 
the Chinese delegation entered, the 
three military officers in front as 
usual. They had one Chinese-speaking 
companion, who had turned out, to 
Hardwick’s surprise, to be Tableman, 
the chemist turned temporary gun- 
man. It seemed that his job at his 
university had been that of a transla- 
tor of Qiinese papers on his subject. 
Not content with reading knowledge, 
he had gone on to learn the spoken 
language as well. It was he who had 
handled the scientists in the party and 
had conducted tours when Hardwick 
and Joanne were not available. He 
sat down quietly in the last row of 
seats while the Orientals moved up 
and took the first row. 

H ardwick stood up in the center 
of the small stage, leaving the 
other two seated behind him, and 
addressed his audience in Mandarin. 

“Good morning, gentlemen. Be- 
fore we conunence this final brief- 
ing, I must formally ask whether 
you consider your task complete? Is 
there anything more you wish to 
see, or feel you have not been 
shown, concommittant with your 



acknowledged purpose in coming 
here? It will be best to save time by 
answering now.” 

The Chinese glanced briefly at one 
another, but no one said a word. 
Then General Lo, long since fuDy 
and openly accepted as the delega- 
tion’s real leader, stood up, nodded 
abruptly and spoke before resuming 
his place. 

“We feel there is nothing we have 
not seen. Whether the tests are re- 
liable under your apparatus and su- 
pervision is another matter, but we 
have done all we can here.” 

Hardwick grinned, but only to him- 
self. The grudging admission was all 
he could have hoped for at this 
point. No modern Chinese, least of 
all a high Communist official, could 
publicly admit that anything Western 
was not somehow suspect, even if no 
tangible evidence existed. 

Outwardly unmoved, he continued. 

“In that case, I will now recapitu- 
late the whole story, keeping it as 
brief as possible. As you now know, 
the history of Joseph began eight 
months ago in Houston, in the state 
of Texas. An outwardly ordinary 
baby, the son of Mr. and Mrs. 
Lucas J. Hittle, was bom on Janua^ 
15, 1976. The birth was normal in 
every respect, save one. 

“As the child was bom, everyone 
in the operating room died. Suspect- 
ing gas, an intern watching through 
glass from outside the room dpnned 
a smoke mask from a fire prevention 
kit on the wall, entered the delivery 
room and saved the baby, who was 
still barely out of his mother’s body. 
The cord was cut and knotted, and 
the child kept warm. 



52 



IF 




“The mask and uniform, despite 
gloves, were of course not complete- 
ly airtight, and the intern also died, 
but only after he had summoned 
help by phone. As fast as that help 
arrived, both doctors and nurses died 
within seconds of entering the room.” 

H ardwick paused and studied the 
impassive faces before him and 
then went on. 

“The baby was not yet suspect, 
but an alert was broadcast and the 
hospital evacuated. Not, however, be- 
fore many patients and staff members 
in adjoining corridors had also died. 
The hospital’s excellent air circulating 
system probably saved the others. 

“Finally, fully suited and masked 
firemen entered the hospital and 
found the baby crying in the chamber 
of death which had introduced him 
to life.” Hardwick still wondered 
about this last line, but Allen liked 
it, so it stayed in. 

“By chance, a brilliant and fa- 
mous doctor was present. He heard 
of what had happened and was the 
first to pick out ^e baby as a cause 
of the mass deaths, working on the 
principle of Occam’s Razor, the line 
of least resistance. He, that is the 
doctor, persuaded everyone to give 
out no news and to handle Joseph 
with every precaution for the time 
being. 

“He also called Washington and 
reached a very high government of- 
ficial whom he had treated in the 
past. As a result of his urgency, the 
whole hospital area was sealed off 
and security measures of a drastic 
nature were established. The press 
was excluded, and the Intelligence 



service chiefs were called to a meeN 
ing in Washington.” 

Hardwick paused and poured hinH 
self a glass of water from a pitcher 
on the table next to him. No one 
spoke, and after a mouthful of water, 
he continued. 

“Meanwhile, the firemen and medi- 
cal staff who had cared for the baby 
in airtight masks and suits were now 
also dying, dying as they removed 
the suits and came into contact with 
a residue, however faint, of the most 
terrible poison ever discovered! 

“And those with them were dying, 
from mere contact with the suits! 

“It was possible to localize the 
whole menace only because the suits 
and masks were removed on the hos- 
pital premises or in an area close by. 
Chance again. If one man, still suit^ 
up, had gone back to the fire sta- 
tion . .! None did so, luckily. 

44^y this time, Washington was 

-D fully alerted and subsequent 
suited personnel were drenched, on 
orders, with an hour-long spray of 
almost corrosive chemicals before re- 
moving their protective clothing and 
helmets. They were volunteers, these 
brave men and women, even so, be- 
cause they all expected to die. They 
did not, however, and a check show- 
ed that their equipment was no longer 
lethal. This was the beginning of our 
project here, the first evidence that 
this incredible pathogen was con- 
trollable or had any limits. 

“Washington now went into full 
operation. The newsmen and every- 
one else were told that a lethal gas 
had been released by a maniac into 
an air-conditioning duct. It was open- 



DEATHCHILD

ly hinted that it might even be radio- 
active, although this was not flatly 
asserted. The area around the hos- 
pital was cleared for a distance of 
fifty blocks, and the hospital was 
first scientifically burned out and then 
razed to nothing but ash and rubble. 
A continuous chemical spray was 
maintained for a week over the ashes, 
every inch of them. Even so, a terrible 
fear gripped the few who knew the 
real story. Would the burning, demo- 
lition and chemical bath do the trick? 
Or would the smoke spread the in- 
stant killer, whatever it was? The 
chance had to be taken, since the 
alternative might be worse. 

“Joseph, by now definitely identi- 
fied as the carrier of the lethd patho- 
gen, w^ secretly, with every due pre- 
caution, rembved to a hidden site, 
and with him all who knew the truth 
of what he was. 

“I am the first person who knows 
this story ever to leave this installa- 
tion, and 1 do not know the area 1 
have left and to which 1 returned 
with you gentlemen. We may be un- 
der the Rockies, in Mammoth Cave 
or buried under an oil rig offshore 
in the Gulf of Mexico. It is not im- 
portant. What is important is what 
followed the decision to save Joseph, 
to hide him and to try to find out 
what caused his monstrous inheri- 
tance. I will now turn this meeting 
over to Dr. Butler, who has presided 
over this project from its inception. 
Since not all of you gentlemen speak 
English and Dr. Butler speaks no 
Chinese, I will translate. Those of 
you who do speak English can insure 
that my trai^ation is an accurate 
one.” 



VII 

J oanne Butler got up and came 
over to stand beside Hardwick. 
He saw her swallow once, and then 
she began to speak, her low voice 
carrying clearly to the men seated 
below. She paused at the end of 
every short paragraph, and Hardwick 
put the words into his best Man- 
darin, before she re-commenced. 

“Gentlemen, you now know who 
I am. I am a biochemist who, among 
other things, has worked for some 
years for the American National 
Foundation of Science. I also hold a 
degree in psychology, which helped 
in my selection for this position. 

“I was virtually kidnapped in the 
middle of the night by agents of the 
U. S. government and taken to an 
interview with three of the highest 
officials of this country. At first, I 
thought they were mad when they 
explained what had happened and 
what they wanted me to do. My 
patriotism was not prepared for such 
a test. And, gentlemen, it still is 
not!” 

She waited, while Hardwick trans- 
lated and then continued, her voice 
soft and even. 

“My patriotism is not, as I said, 
up to the test of running the sci- 
entific side of this project. But some- 
thing else is, my feeling for all hu- 
manity.” 

Hardwick expected at least a 
cynical smile from General Lo at this 
point, but to his surprise, noted noth- 
ing of the kind. Indeed, the Red 
security chief had leaned forward to 
hear better, and his face was com- 
pletely serious. 



54 



IF 




Joanne went on, after the 'transla- 
tion. 

“When I heard the proposal that 
this child and his awful gift be 
used as the Ultimate Weapon, I was 
revolted to every fibre of my being, 
I refused the t^ for which I had 
been selected. But — I was per- 
suaded at least to listen further. 

“I was told what the leaders of 
my government planned. They des- 
perately fear a third World War, a 
war of total annihilation using every 
ghastly weapon ever devised, from 
bacteria and gas to the cobolt Hell 
bombs. They felt, and feel, that such 
a war is perilously close. They felt 
humanity had one last chance, and 
that chance was Joseph — whom 
they had christened the Deathchild. 

44Tt was made very clear to me,” 

A she went on, “that there would 
be no conquest of any foreign coun- 
try, China or any other. China would 
be the target for Joseph, however, 
if all else failed. Russia could be 
discounted, and even allied, since the 
Soviet staffs were already in secret 
and joint discussions with those of 
the West. 

“But China and her new arsenal 
of conquest, her new tributary states 
and her new atteiApts to rule the 
entire mass of eastern Asia, meant 
war. This was demonstrated to me 
in a hundred details. Whether you 
gentlemen here agree or disagree is 
not important, since I believed it and 
1 still do. 

“I have been in charge of this place 
and all that it implies for over seven 
months, which I regard as seven 
months of torment. I have helped in 



and supervised the chemical tests and 
extractions of fluid from the baby’s 
body and their subsequent processing. 
You have seen and tested the arsenal 
of test tubes which resulted. They 
are my work. You have seen the 
fantastic and hitherto-unheard-of 
safeguards used to take care of the 
Deathchild and also to protect him. 
You have been allowed to talk free- 
ly with the scientific staff of this 
place, to examine and pry into every 
detail, save for certain security 
measures, that exist here. You have 
seen the extraordinary robot mother 
designed to keep the baby in a happy 
state of mind as well as body, since 
we dare not tamper with anything 
that affects his overall well-being. 
And you have observed the baby 
and his own care and treatment.” 

Hardwick thought he heard a very 
faint catch of breath when Joanne 
said “mother,” but he could not be 
sure. He dismissed the idea temporari- 
ly and went on with his translating. 
The thought could be recovered. She 
continued, her voice steady: 

“You have seen aH the films of 
Houston General Hospital, the death 
films and those of the destruction. 
You have, and I stress this point for 
the scientists among you, been al- 
lowed to examine the test animals, 
and have seen that the new death 
does not affect them. It is reserved 
for humans, who brought it into the 
world. 

“You have had access to our 
shielded labs and have run tests of 
your own, utilizing a lot of equip- 
ment you brought with you. You have 
examined all the cunning air and 
waste disposal devices, the flame in- 

IF 



56 




cinerators, the filters, the chemical 
baffles. Is there anything you have 
not seen and still feel you must?” 

A gain there was silence, and again 
no one spoke. Eventually, after 
a look at his silent companions, Gen- 
eral Lo shook his head. 

“Very well,” said Joanne. “My 
responsibility for this group is over. 
I return you to General Hardwick.” 
She walked back and sat down next 
to Allen again, shutting her eyes as 
she did so, from what seemed simple 
weariness. 

“You have heard Dr. Butler speak 
for, and to, the scientists,” said 
Hardwick, resuming his conversation- 
al style. “There are a few other 
points to be mentioned. We have no 
clue to this day of Joseph’s lethal 
mutation. No germ or bacteria, no 
virus, absolutely nothing, has been 
isolated. We remain as ignorant m 
at the beginning on what we are 
dealing with. You have seen the 
medical records of every member of 
the baby’s family which we could 
provide, from birth to death, as far 
back as- we can reach. There is 
nothing, no hint, no lead, in any of 
them. All were ordinary, simple 
Americans, differing in no way from 
the norm, physically or mentally. His 
father, poor man, is in a well guarded 
mental home, suffering from shock.” 
Hardwick’s voice hardened. “But 
we can, by using the baby’s wastes, 
his blood, his perspiration, dilute and 
render usable in a military sense the 
death that he carries. We have done 
so on volunteers, people who were 
inevitably soon to die anyway of dis- 
ease or of natural causes. These mag- 



nificent people, all doomed to die in 
any case, gave the brief remainder 
of their lives to test Joseph’s con- 
tinuing power to kill. You have seen 
the films and records of the men 
*and women who died, not knowing 
why or how, to make sure the 
Deathchild could still kill. Their 
passing, as in all other cases, was 
instantaneous and painless. Beyond 
that grace, we have nothing to give 
them but honor. 

“Two of your members selected 
certain of their bodies, carefully pre- 
served by freezing, and performed 
dissections with every device we 
could give you to aid. You have 
their findings. This ends the dis- 
cussion on the local level. I will now 
read a document, an official copy of 
which will be given to you for trans- 
mission to your own government.” 

H is voice steady, Hardwick pulled 
the papers from his tunic pock- 
et and began to read: 

“I, as President of the United 
States of America, in accordance with 
the powers vested in me by Congress, 
and in defense of not only the nation- 
al security of the United States but 
the security of the entire human 
race, make upon the Government of 
the Chinese People’s Republic the

T wo weeks had come and gone 
when Hardwick emerged from 
his daily visit to the guarded com- 
munications center. It was four 
o’clock in the afternoon by his watch, 



and a feeling of futility and de- 
pression rode him like the black dog 
his Irish grandmother used to talk 
about. 

There was still no answer to 
Washington from Peking, and time 
was running out. In only another 
five days he would have to give or- 
ders to start loading the sealed cases 
which were Joseph’s gift to his fel- 
low humans. The helicopters would 
come to the hidden field far above, 
and the cargo of death would de- 
part, to begin its journey to the far- 
scattered launching sites, airfields and 
submarine pens. 

And what would happen then, be 
thought? If his deepest and almost 
unconscious suspicions were correct, 
what would happen then? 

He strolled along the corridors 
toward his quarters, nodding absently 
to the guards as he passed them. He 
had nearly reached his room when 
he saw Joanne passing ahead of him 
at a cross corridor. 

Without even thinking, he called 
out to her, and she waited until he 
had caught up. 

Hardwick had not seen much of 
his female counterpart since the de- 
parture of the Qiinese delegation. 
She had totally withdrawn, staying 
in her quarters and having most of 
her me^s sent in. The only time 
she had come out was for work, the 
continual and never-ceasing tests and 
inspections of the baby’s byproducts 
and serology. Otherwise, she had 
simply stayed away from everyone, 
even from Tom Allen, who was her 
closest friend in the installation. 

Now, under the unvarying glow 
of the fluorescents, she waited almost

IF 




passively as he approached. Her face, 
he saw with an inner wrench, was 
white and drawn, the skin taut over 
her high cheekbones, the eyes 
smudged and blurred looking, with- 
out expression. 

“Hey, lady, where you been?” he 
asked in a voice. He took her 
by the arm, and she followed as if 
without a will of her own. Inward- 
ly, he cursed the world and its prob- 
lems which had brought the two of 
them together under this man-killing 
strain and these cave-dwelling con- 
ditions. 

“I prescribe a stiff belt in my 
quarters,” he said, trying to keep his 
voice casual. “You don’t mind not 
being chaperoned, I hope?” 

H er only answer was a wan smile, 
but she made no resistance and 
allowed him almost to lead her to 
his room. It was as if the unending 
responsibility had finally drained 
away all her will power and left a 
semi-robot, capable only of routine 
tasks. 

He had barely seated her in the 
room’s only chair and started to open 
his little wall refrigerator when his 
private phone burred, the green light 
indicating a closed line. He put down 
the ice cubes and picked it up, won- 
dering what now. 

“Okay, pal,” said Tom ADen. “I 
was just in the comm romn. They 
gave in. A Kttle haggling, but they 
gave in. A few of our reports have 
picked up the start of a pullout from 
Burma already. Congratulatkms! Say 
so to your friend as weD. Good 
luck.” There was a click, and the line 
was dead. 



Hardwick put the phone down 
slowly, wondering, as he had in the 
past, where Allen got some of his 
information. How had he known 
Joanne was there? And why “Good 
luck”? Maybe ESP was his secret. 

He looked at her, staring at the 
wall, her face dead and gcme to out- 
side concerns, and felt a violent Tieed 
to bring her back to life on a crash 
basis. 

She sipped the drink he gave her 
but still said nothing, like a child 
doing what an adult has mrdered, 
dutifully but uncomprehendingly. 

“Joanne,” he said softly, standing 
over her. “Look at me. We’ve won. 
That was Tom on the phone. The 
Chinese are coming to terms. It 
worked. We’re really going to have 
peace for a while.” 

She looked up slowly and blinked. 
Then her tired eyes Med with tears. 
She put the glass on the floor and 
buried her face in her hands, sobbing 
uncontrollably. Hardwick stood over 
her, his own face working, and won- 
dered, like a normal male idiot, 
what to do. 

She solved the problem for him 
by rising and coming into his arms 
so quickly that some of his highball 
sloshed over her back. Neither of 
them paid it any attention. 

It was half an hour before any 
sense returned to the room, and by 
this time they were both in the 
chair. 

Joanne was curled up in his lap, 
her arms still around his neck, her 
hair in total disorder, an expression 
of bliss on her face, which seemed 
to have lost years of age in mere 
moments. 



DEATHCHILD

C ursing himself for what he had 
to do, Hardwick rose, lifted her 
and laid her gently on the bed. Then 
he stood away from her, looking 
down, his hands behind his back. 

“Honey,” he said, “we have to 
settle something right now. I’ve lived 
with a crazy idea for a long time, 
and the crazier it got, the more sense 
it made. I have to know the answer.” 
The smile slipped from her face; 
she lay back on the pillow and stared 
at him. 

“Whose child is Joseph?” asked 
Hardwick quietly. “And aside from 
not being toilet-trained, what else 
prevents him from adorning a living 
room rug in any normal home?” 

To his amazement, after a quick 
catch of breath, a very faint smile 
appeared at the corner of her mouth. 
She stretched and locked her arms 
behind her head in relaxation. 

“He’s mine, Al. Had you got that 
far?”^ 

Hardwick exhaled a gust of air 
and sat down suddenly in the vacated 
chair. 

“And there’s nothing wrong with 
him at all is there?” 

“Not a thing, dear.” 

“Who else knows?” asked Hard- 
wick. He got up and made himself 
a new drink, feeling curiously light- 
headed. 

“Make me another one too, will 
you? No one knows the whole story 
but the President, Tom Allen, me — 
and now you. It had to be that way. 
I’ll have to report you, of course, 
unless you’d rather do it yourself.” 
“Who’s the father?” Hardwick 
asked thickly. He was not loc^dng 
at her and had faced the other way. 



“A man who had supplied the 
sperm bank of a small hospital in 
Billings, Montana,” came the un- 
ruffled reply from behind him. “He 
was medically fit and' a citizen. 
That’s all I Imow, except that Tom 
destroyed all his hospital records, 
whoever he was.” 

“I checked on a few things while 
going over the personnel record 
files, Joanne,” he said, at length. 
“You have a small birthmark on your 
left calf. It didn’t register until I 
noticed that Joseph does too. These 
things frequently are hereditary. My 
father and brother had identical ones. 
No proof, but it got me to thinking. 
It seemed absurd, of course. It meant 
everything had to be a fraud, from 
beginning to end. Then I thought of 
the code name of this operation 
which, by ‘the way, the Chinese 
never heard. “Inside Straight”! Who 
thought that up, I wondered? A des- 
perate and unlikely gamble, using a 
sucker’s attempt to fill a bad hand. 
A bad, almost hopeless hand^ one in- 
trinsically worth nothing! ^I’m no 
psychologist, but that struck me as 
odd. Who could believe the United 
States, with life or death, at stake 
would gamble on nothing, a dud 
poker hand? But if it filled, as it just 
has, then it’s a real hand! The most 
colossal gamble in human history!” 

H e drank and turned to face her. 
“Who thought it up?” 

‘Tom Allen and I. His wife, Lee, 
is — was my sister. Do you want 
me to tell you the whole story, in 
order?” Her placidity was once again 
restored, as it had been when they 
first met.

IF 




“You know very well that I do.** 

“All right, here’s what happened.” 

Joanne and Allen had seen a lot 
of each other in Washington after 
the death of Allen’s wife. They had 
often played complicated games for 
amusement, including one they had 
invented, which they called Super- 
spy, In this game, each one had to 
present the other, who represented a 
major power, with a fait accompli, 
a means meticulously worked out, by 
which his or her country was ab- 
solutely compelled to surrender. The 
opponent, faced with this overwhelm- 
ing menace, had to somehow frus- 
trate or nullify it. From this game 
came the concept of the Deathchild, 
the lethal mutant in reverse, the one 
weapon to end them all. But some- 
thing was missing, the actual con- 
vincer, the gimmick which really 
caused death. 

Then, exactly at the right time, a 
report had crossed Allen’s desk, com- 
ing directly from a field agent who 
operated in the Virgin Islands. No 
one else in » Washington had seen it 
before Allen. It told how a young 
biochemist in a small, marine labora- 
tory, working with animal proteins 
and alkaloids derived from corals 
and other forms of sea life, had dis- 
covered and isolated a terrible poison. 
So awful did he feel this substance 
to be, he had actually contacted the 
C.I.A. directly, not even informing 
his superiors at the research station 
where he worked. 

Allen had called Joanne at once 
and simultaneously sent a pickup 
order for the man and his family. 

“Where are they now?” interrupted 
Hardwick. 



**On our Ascension Island bas^ un- 
der total security wraps* He had al- 
ways wanted to wrhe^ and now ho 
has the best private library in kis 
field* He and his wife voluntemd, 
without knowing why. One nme 
group of unsung heroes, but his job 
is a lot easier than most.” 

A llen had had the authority te go, 
and did go, straight to the White 
House. Approv^ came after a week, 
and meanwhile six C.I.A. chemists 
had died testing the poison, which 
acted in many ways much like the 
nerve gases, only in far smaller quan- 
tities. Further, like a number of pro- 
teins, it left absolutely no trace. The 
original discoverer had simply not re- 
fined it sufficiently and thus had 
lived. 

Joanne had then become pregnant 
under a false identity. They had felt 
this was the only way to insure cmn- 
plete security, and it had been ABea’s 
suggestion. She had asked him te be 
the father, and he had refused, feding 
it would make her task unbearalBe. 
The whole matter from then on had 
been so falsified that no one con- 
cerned had known anything but in- 
consequential bits of the total story. 

Next had come the selection of 
the hospital. Houston General was 
fairly old and a new one was badly 
needed. The pictures of the dead and 
other evidence were fakes, all con- 
cerned being of C.I.A. agents, none 
of whom were later associated with 
the project. The staff of the hospital 
was a harder problem, but not in- 
soluble. Mostly they had been care- 
fully dispersed, with only a final hard 
core remaining, who were put under 



DEATHCHILD 



61 




National Security Oath. None of them 
were in the hospital on the day of 
Joseph’s supposed birth* The dead 
firemen and patients, the heroic doc- 
tors and nurses who gave their lives, 
were all agents, and all were pulled 
off the project immediately after and 
reassigned as far away as possible. 

At each level, a new team was 
introduced and an old one scattered 
to the winds. A few of the more 
pertinacious inquiries were dealt with 
by top level interviews, and the blan- 
ket of National Security was invoked. 

Only Allen and Joanne were in it 
all the way. Not even the Cabinet 
knew the real story, nor did the In- 
telligence department heads. The Sec- 
retary of Defense and the Chief Jus- 
tice didn’t even know the details of 
the cover story, a fact they were well 
aware of, and indeed had been in- 
structed to tell the Chinese; 

T he plant installation had certainly 
been built with every precaution, 
just as if the whole thing were true. 
To everyone who thought he knew 
the actual truth, save for the Presi- 
dent, Joanne and Allen, the precau- 
tions, guards and secrecy were vital. 

“I can understand that,” said Hard- 
wick. “If it wasn’t believable to the 
last ounce, the whole atmosphere was 
gone. But I don’t see how the stuff 
got moved around. Does it really kill 
in the atmosphere in those minute 
quantities?” 

“Al, G-gas practically does too, 
and diat’s been around since the 
Second World War. But Josephine, 
which is what Tom and I ca^ the 
poison, dissipates almost at once. 
There are no traces any test can de- 



tect. It seems to be a close cousin of 
Ciguatera, the tropical poison that 
kills people after they eat certain 
marine fish. They may even be two 
aspects of the same thing.” 

The chemical fiddling was very 
tricky, she went on, but not impossi- 
ble. Every technical loophole they 
could thi^ of had been blocked a 
month before Hardwick had arrived. 
In a way, he was the last test. Allen 
had a high belief in Hardwick’s in- 
telligence and had argued that if he 
could be fooled, anyone could. Hard- 
wick felt professionally pleased at 
the tribute, but was still puzzled. 

“Couldn’t any of your science peo- 
ple have realiz^ that vents and hid- 
den ducts and secret pipes in the fil- 
ters were feeding this stuff in and 
that none of it came from the baby?” 
“They could, but only if the idea 
were given them first. ITie place was 
built to be believed. Workmen who 
had no idea of what they were doing 
installed all those hidden bits and 
pieces on the orders of engineers who 
had no idea why they were wanted. 
Then they all left. Then and only 
then, don’t you see, did the science 
staff come and get the full treatment. 
Why shouldn’t they believe it?” 

“Yes, I see,” said Hardwick. “The 
belief just grew and grew, until it 
spread to every new person like a 
miasma. And I suppose you and Tom 
checked the mysterious machinery 
and the poison apparatus yourselves?” 
This was correct, she said. Allen 
was, among other things, a trained 
electrical engineer, and she was a 
competent chemist as well as a psy- 
chologist. The two could not have 
built the apparatus originally, but it 

IF 



62 




was no trouble to monitor and main- 
tain it, once installed. Any heavy or 
serious checking was always done 
during a mock evacuation or fire drill 
of the particular area needed. 

T here was a long silence while 
Hardwick simply sat and stared 
at the floor, hands clasped between 
his knees. 

Eventually he looked up and met 
her sympathetic gaze. 

“What now, Joanne? It worked. 
Sounds banal, but you seem to have 
saved the world. But what about 
Joseph? Who saves him? And what 
happens to this place? I’ve never had 
a chance to think about that aspect 
before, but you and Tom must have.” 
He sighed. “What happens now? And 
what about your child, your little 
boy?” 

She got off the bed, came over 
and knelt at his side. 

“We stay here, dear. Joseph stays, 
and we stay. He’s my son, and I love 
him desperately, fatherless, alone and 
thinking that a fdthy robot, padded 
with cloth, is his mother. But he 



stays. Tom stays. We all stay. The 
play goes on. 

“We can’t let up. You can see that, 
if you think a minute. In five ten 
years, peace may be secure enough 
for us to come out and change our 
names. Maybe it will I don’t know. 

“But meanwhile, the Deatbchild 
has to stay. He had to be believed 
in, hidden, guarded, cared for. Tom 
says the enemy will never, never stop 
looking for him. We may have to 
move, may have to rebuild this whole 
place somewhere else. So everyone 
has to believe in it, totally, religious- 
ly, especially our staff. They’re giving 
their lives and devotion to an idea. 
The idea has to stay valid. It may 
be trite,” she ended, “but we have 
each other now. That helps.” 

It helped, Hardwick guessed, as he 
sat looking down at her, but some- 
how all he saw in his mind was a 
round-faced baby, who might have 
been his son. It was silly, in the face 
of world peace, to quibble about one 
atom of mortality, but he wcmdmd 
if he would ever be able to hold 
Joseph in his arms. END

PADDlEWHEEl ON THE STYX

On the hottest planet of all, they 
rode its molten streams of metal 
in a nuclear-powered river boat! 



^X^he Styx, the Acheron, the Phleg- 
^ thon. These are the rivers of 
Mercury. The Cocytus, the Lethe, 
the Mare Infernum, These are the 
seas of Mercury. They are the 
waters of Hell. 

The Charon is the sole sailor of 
the seas of Hell. Gaunt, scorched 
dull black, its paddlewheels propel 
it through the Beardsley-drawn 
shadow world of the Sunside, a 
stranger to the sea. 

Cerberus, the watchdog of Hell, 
spotted it as it fell, an Icarus blaz- 
ing in the sky. The sensors on Cer- 
berus screamed their warning to the 
reflector-plated dome of Dis. Gaunt- 
lets of oyster-white plastex coated 



with frost trained the detectors of 
Dis on it. The commander of Dis 
read the reports and looked at his 
screens in fear. 

The Phoebus-K engines that bore 
it left a trail of hydrogen deriva- 
tives glowing in the sky as the Copa 
de Oro dived on the Sunside. Rhad- 
amanthus, the judge of Hell, beam- 
ed autocontrol signals into the ra- 
diation-scared sky as the unrespon- 
sive ship fell. The Copa de Oro 
streaked down, gaining speed. 

In Dis, the computers made 
noises like pneumatic hammers and 
put an answer on their screens. ES-

The commander of Dis nodded to 
his subordinates, who checked their 
maps. The Copa de Oro would come 
down at Point Dante, two hundred 
miles south of Dis. 

The Copa de Oro was worth 
everything that could be done to 
salvage her gaunt silver shape. She 
made up one-third of Earth’s nu- 
clear space fleet. She was priceless. 

Don Manuel Stilette Dos Muer- 
tos, the boatman of the infernal re- 
gions, donned his white suit with a 
row of chill-coils nesting like snakes 
in the back. He ran up the stairs 
through Dis to the docks. 

'^he paddlewheels clawed at the 
-■* softly glowing sea. They cut 
through and came up, tiny viscous 
cltunps of lava dripping from the 
blades. In the dark of the buildings 
they resembled tiny sunsets as they 
fell into the sea. Dos Muertos 
swung the Charon south to the land 
where the stilettos of the sun knifed 
and gouged and bounced into the 
seas of flowing rock and lead and 
tin. 

Dos Muertos sat in his big com- 
mand chair aboard the Charon and 
looked at the frost that covered his 
controls. Two nozzles in the ceiling 
sprayed coolant down onto the cab- 
in. To look at Dos Muertos through 
his visor of #7 amber revealed a 
pale, patrician face. Dos Muertos 
had an air about him that was just 
barely placable. 

Dos Muertos was a matador. The

brava was not in the Plaza del Ttros 
in Madrid, facing bulls, but on Mer- 
cury, facing the weapons of the sun. 
That was Dos Muertos: a matador. 
An enemy to the sun. 

Rudders turned. Jets of compress- 
ed oxygen spiurted from tanks in the 
hull. The Charon surged forward 
and southward. The winglike sides 
of the ship cut through the glowing 
waves and stood out in the red mists 
that belched from the craters that 
lined the shore. The Charon rode 
south. 

Point Dante was a jut of rock 
with four crown-rimmed craters on 
it that spewed lava. Atop the rim 
of one crater the Copa de Oro bal- 
anced. The Charon cut through a 
wave of lava borne aloft by tectonic 
activity and came within scope

range of Point Dante. Dos Muertos 
brought down his periscope and 
swept the area. 

The Copa de Oro was a great tri- 
jtailed thing, and her nose was in 
position for a quick line from the 
Charon, So the matador moved in, 
the Charon his cape, swordless. 

Percolating in the crater, the lava 
bubbled up, and a wave cascaded 
(down onto the port flank of the 
Cdpa de Oro, The metal had already 
peeled, and lava whooshed through 
iEUid into the innards of the Num- 
ber Two Phoebus-K. The Phoebus’s 
nozzle flared out and vomited metal 
and flame. 

Dos Muertos watched, transfixed. 

Number Three ignited and split 
at the seams. Metal fell away and 
hit the sea. Bubbles of lava appear- 
ed. Hydrogen derivatives spurted 
from exposed tanks and left a trail 
on the crater’s rim. 

Number Two ignited and func- 
tioned properly. Its thrust shoved 
the Copa from her position atop the 
crater info the sea. The rounded 
nose of the ship entered the sea a 
few yards in front of the Charon. 

That was the charge of the sun/ 



bull. Dos Muertos’s veronica was 
quick and life-saving. He reversed 
the paddles and fired the forward 
jets as the waves the Copals fall 
had raised washed over the Charon's 
bow. Dos Muertos looked into his 
periscope. Lava was dripping over 
the lens, giving a very odd view as 
it thinned into transparency. He 
checked his controls. Aside from a 
twelve-degree list the Charon was 
functioning as well as could be ex- 
pected. 

The Charon limped away. Dos 
Muertos was silent. He only looked 
at his upper screens of #7 relux and 
felt hate. He knew who the enemy 
was. The sun was his enemy. He 
couldn’t defeat the sun, for only 
time was capable of that, but he 
could harass it and worry it. Any 
victory at all was a major one; 
every Brienne was an Austerlitz, for 
the sun was an enemy to hate with 
all the hate Dos Muertos could 
dredge from his soul. 

The Charon carried him away to 
Dis, where the sun could penetrate 
to lash with radiation and heat to 
destroy the matador, a stranger to 
the sea. END

dke a sentient being — 

Even Steve Hanaxdy could fit 
that description. He was a short, 
stocky man, with the look about 
him of someone who had lived too 
close to the animal stage. His eyes 
were perpetually narrowed, as if 
he were peering against a bright 
light. His face was broad and 
fleshy. But he was human. He 
could think and act, and he was a 
giver and not a taker. 

— Put this sentient person in a 
solar system surrounded by a two 
billion light-year ocean of virtual 
nothingness beyond which, appar- 
ently, is more nothingness — 

Hanardy, a product of Earth^s 
migration to the moon and to the 
planets of the solar system, was 
born on Europa, one of the moons 
of Jupiter, before the educational 
system caught up to the colonists. 
He grew up an incoherent rousta- 
bout and a spacehand on the 
frdghters and passenger liners that 
sped about among the immense 
amount of debris — from moons 
to habitable meteorites — that sur- 
rounded the massive Jupiter. It 
was a rich and ever-growing trade 
area, and so presently even the 
stolid, unimaginative Hanardy had 
a freighter of his own. Almost from 
the beginning, his most fruitful 
journeys were occasional trips to 
the meteorite where a scientist, 
Professor Ungam, lived with his 



daughter, Patricia. For years, it was 
a lucrative, routine voyage, with- 
out incident.

vidual with this enigma of be--

To begin with, he accepted a 
passenger — a reporter namrf Wil- 
liam Leigh, who ostensibly wanted 
to write up the lonely route for his 
news syndicate. But almost as soon 
as the frei^ter reached the Un- 
garn meteorite and entered the 
airlock, the meteorite was attacked 
by strange space vessels, whkh 
were capable of far greater speeds 
than an}rthing Hanardy had ever 
seen. And William Leigh was not 
who he seemed. 

It was hard to know just lAo 
he was. What actually happened 
as far as Hanardy was concerned, 
was quite simple: One of the de- 
fensive ' energy screens had gone 
down before the attack of the 
strange ships; and Professor Un- 
garn sent Hanardy to machine a 
new part for the screen’s drive unit. 
While he was engaged in this, 
Leigh came upon him by surprise, 
attacked him, and tied him up. 

L ying there on the floor, bound 
hand and foot, Hanardy thought 
in anguish: “If I ever get loose, 
Fm gonna hightail it out of herel” 
He tested the rope that held 
him and groaned at its unyielding

IF 




toughness. He lay, then, for a 
while, accepting the confinement 
of the bonds, but underneath was 
a great grief and a great fear. 

He suspected that Professor Un- 
garn and the professor’s daughter, 
Patricia, were equally helpless, or 
they would have tried during the 
past hour to find out what had 
happened to him. 

He listened again, intently, holding 
himself still. But only the steady 
throbbing of the distant d3mamoa 
was audible. No footsteps ap- 
proached ; there was no other 
movement. 

He was still listening when he 
felt an odd tugging inside his 
body. 

Shivering a little, Hanardy shook 
his head as if to dear it of men- 
tal fog — and dimbed to his feet. 

He didn’t notice that the cords 
that had bound him fell away. 

Out in the corridor, he paused 
tensdy. The place looked deserted, 
empty. Except for the vague vibra- 
tion from the djmamos, a great d- 
lence pressed in upon him. The 
place had the look and feel of be- 
ing on a planet. The artifidal grav- 
ity made him somewhat lighter than 
on Earth, but he was used to such 
changes. It was hard to grasp that 
he was inside a meteorite, hun- 
dreds of thousands of miles from 
the nearest moon or inhabited 
planet. Being here was like being 
inside a big building, on an upper 
floor. 



Hanardy headed for the nearest 
elevator shaft. He thought: I’d bet- 
ter untie Miss Pat, then her pop, 
and then get. 

It was an automatic decision, to 
go to the girl first. Despite her 
sharp tongue, he admired her. He 
had seen her use weapons to in- 
jure, but that didn’t change his 
feeling. He guessed that she’d be 
very angry — very possibly she’d 
blame him for the whole mess. 

Presently he was knocking hesi- 
tantly on the door to Patricia’s 
apartment. Hesitantly, because he 
was certain that she was not in a 
position to answer. 

When, after a reasonable pause, 
there was no reply, he pressed 
gently on the latch. The door 
swung open. 

He entered pure enchantment. 

'^he apartment was a physical 
delight. There were French-t3rpe 
windows that opened onto a sun- 
lit window. The French doors were 
open, and the sound of birds 
singing wafted in through them. 
There were other doors leading to 
the inner world of the girl’s home, 
and Hanardy, who had occasional- 
ly been in the other rooms to do 
minor repair work, knew that there 
also ever3dhing was as costly as it 
was here in this large room that 
he could see. 

Then he saw the girl. She was ly- 
ing on the floor, half-hidden be- 
hind her favorite chair, and she

was bound hand and foot with wire. 

Hanardy walked toward her un- 
happily. It was he who had brought 
William Leigh, and he wasn^t quite 
sure just how he would argue him- 
self out of any accusation she might 
make about that. His guilt showed 
in the way he held his thick-set 
body, in the shuffling of his legs, in 
the awkward way he knelt beside 
her. He began gingerly to deal 
with the thin wire that enlaced 
and interlaced her limbs. 

The girl was patient. She waited 
till he had taken all the wire off 
her and then, without moving 
from the floor, began to rub the 
circulation back into her wrists and 
ankles. 

She looked up at him and made 
her first comment: ^'How did you 
avoid being tied up?” 

‘T didn’t. He got me, too,” said 
Hanardy. He spoke eagerly, anxious 
to be one of the injured, along 
with her. He already felt better. 
She didn’t seem to be angry. 

''Then how did you get free?” 
Patricia Ungarn asked. 

"Why, I just — ” Hanardy be- 
gan. 

He stopped, thunderstruck. He 
thought back, then over what had 
happened. He had been l 3 dng there, 
tied. And then . and then . 

What? 

He stood blank, scarcely daring 
to think. Realizing that an answer 
was expected, he began apologeti- 
cally, "I guess he didn’t tie me up 



so good, and 1 was in a kind of a 
hurry, figuring you were here, and 
so I just — ” 

Even as he spoke, his whole be- 
ing rocked with the remembrance of 
how tough those ropes had been a 
few minutes before he freed him- 
self. 

He stopped his mumbling expla- 
nation because the girl wasn’t lis- 
tening, wasn’t even looking. She 
had climbed to her feet, and she 
was continuing to rub her hands. 
She was small of build and good- 
looking in a bitter way. Her lips 
were pressed too tightly together; 
her eyes were slightly narrowed 
with a kind of permanent anxiety. 
Except for that, she looked like a 
girl in her teens, but cleverer and 
more sophisticated than most girls 
her age. 

Even as Hanardy, In his heavy 
way, was aware of the complexity 
of her, she faced him again. She 
said with an un-girl-likc decisive- 
ness, "Tell me everything that hap- 
pened to you.” 

TTanardv was glad to let go of 
■^■^of the unsatisfactory recollec- 
tion of his own escape. He said, 
"First thing I know, this guy comes 
in there while I’m working at the 
lathe. And is he strong, and is he 
fasti I never would’ve thought he 
had that kind of muscle and that 
fast way of moving. I’m pretty 
chunky, y’understand — ” 

"What then?” She was patient.

IF 




but there was a pointedness about 
her question that channeled his at- 
tention back to the main line of 
events. 

”Then he ties me up, and then 
he goes out, and then he takes 
those Dreeghs from the spaceship 
and disappears into space.” Han- 
ardy shook his head, wonderingly. 
”That^s what gets me. How did he 
do that?” 

He paused, in a brown study; but 
he came from the distance of his 
thought back into the room, to re- 
alize guiltily that the girl had 
spoken to him twice. 

*^Sorry,” he muttered. was 
thinking about how he did that, 
and it’s kind of hard to get the 
idea.” He finished, almost accus- 
ingly: '^Do you know what he 
does?” 

The girl looked at him, a star- 
tled expression on her face. Han- 
ardy thought she was angry at 
his inattention and said hastily: 
”I didn’t hear what you wanted me 
to do. Tell me again, huh! ” 

She seemed unaware that he had 
Spoken. '^What does he do, Steve?” 

'^Why, he just — ” 

At that point, Hanardy stopped 
short and glanced back mentally 
over the glib words he had been 
using. It was such a fantastic dia- 
logue, that he could feel the blood 
draining from his cheeks. 

'*HuhI” he said. 

"What does he do, Steve?” He 
saw that she was looking at him, as 



if she imderstood something that 
he didn’t. It irritated him. 

He said unhappily: "I’d better 
go and untie your father before 
that last bunch of Dreeghs shows 
up.” 

Having spoken, he stopped 
again, his mouth open in amaze- 
ment. He thought: "I must be nuts. 
What am I saying?” 

He turned and started for the 
door. 

"Come back here!” 

Her voice, sharp and commanding, 
cut into him. Defensively, he put 
up between himself and her the 
thick barrier of stolidity which had 
served him for so many years in 
his relations with other people. He 
swung awkwardly around to face 
her again. Before he could speak, 
she said with intensity: "How did 
he do it, Steve?” 

The question ran up against a 
great stubbornness in him. He had 
no feeling of deliberately resisting 
her. But the mental fog seemed to 
settle down upon his being, and he 
said: "Do what. Miss?” 

"Leave?” 

"Who?” He felt stupid before her 
questions, but he felt even more 
stupid for having had meaning- 
less thoughts and said meaning- 
less things. 

"Leigh — you fool! That’s 
who.” 

"I thought he took that space- 
boat of yours that looks like an 
automobile.” 



THE PROXY INTELLIGENCE

'^here was a long pause. The girl 
' ^ denched and undenched her 
ter hands. Now she seemed very 
imchildlike indeed. Hanardy, who 
had seen her angry before, cringed 
and waited for the thunder and 
lightning of her rage to lash out 
at him. Instead, the tenseness 
faded. She seemed suddenly 
thoughtful and said with unexpect- 
ed gentleness: ”After that, Steve? 
After he got out there 1” 

She swung her arm and pointed 
at the aviary, where the sunlight 
glinted beyond the French win- 
dows. Hanardy saw birds fluttering 
among the trees. Their musical 
cries gave the scene a homey touch, 
as if it really were a garden. As 
he watched, the tree leaves stir- 
red; and he knew that hidden fans 
were blowing an artificial breeze. 
It was like a summer afternoon, ex- 
cept that just beyond the glasslike 
w^ was the blackness of space. 

It was a cosmic night outside, dis- 
turbed here and there by an atom 
of matter — a planet hidden from 
sight by its own relative smallness 
and distance from an3rthing else; a 
sun, a point of light and energy, 
quickly lost in darkness so vast 
that presently its light would fade, 
and become one grain in a misty 
bright cloud that obscured the 
blackness for a moment of universe 
time and occupied an inch of space, 
or so it seemed. • • • 

Hanardy contemplated that star- 
tling vista. He was only vaguely 



aware that his present intensity of 
interest was quite different from 
similar thoughts he had had in the 
past. On his long journeys, such 
ideas had slipped into and out of 
his mind. He recalled having had 
a thought about it just a few 
months before. He had been look- 
ing out of a porthole, and — just 
for an instant — the mystery of 
the empty immensity had touched 
him. And he’d thought: ”What the 
heck is behind all this? How does 
a guy like me rate being alive?” 
Aloud, Hanardy muttered: *'Fd 
better get your father free, Miss 
Pat” He finished under his breath: 
”And then beat it out of here — 
fast” 

n 

TTe turned, and this time, though 
she csJled after him an- 
grily, he stumbled out into the 
corridor and went down to the 
depths of the meteorite, where the 
dynamos hummed and throbbed; 
and where, presently, he had Pro- 
fessor Ungarn untied. 

The older man was quite cheer- 
ful *'Well, Steve, we’re not dead 
yet. I don’t know why they didn’t 
jump in on us, but the screens are 
still holding, I see.” 

He was a gaunt man with deep- 
set eyes and the unhappiest face 
Hanardy have ever seen. He stood, 
rubbing the circulation back into 
his arms. Strength of intellect shone 



72 



IF 




from his face, along ^th the mel- 
ancholy. He had defended the mb- 
teorite in such a calm, practical 
way from the attacking Dreeghs 
that it was suddenly easy to re- 
alize that this sad-faced man was 
actually the hitherto unsuspected 
observer of the solar system for a 
vast galactic culture, which includ- 
ed at its top echelon the Great Ga- 
lactic — who had been William 
Leigh — and at the bottom. Pro- 
fessor Ungard and his lovely daugh- 
ter. 

The thoughts about that seeped 
into Hanardy^s fore-consdoxis. He 
realized that the scientist was pri- 
marily a protector. He and this 
station were here to prevent con- 
tact between Earth and the galaxy. 
Man and his earth-born civiliza- 
tion were still too low on the scale 
of development to be admitted to 
awareness that a gigantic galac- 
tic culture existed. Interstellar 
ships of other low-echelon cultures 
which had been admitted to the 
galactic union were warned away 
from the solar system whenever 
they came too dose. Acddentally, 
jthe hunted, lawless Dreeghs had 
wandered into this forbidden sec- 
tor of space. In thdr lust for blood 
and life energy they had avidly 
(Concentrated here in the hope of 
gaining such a quantity of blood, 
and so great a supply of life ener- 
gy, that they would be freed for 
endless years from their terrible 
search. 



It bad qvifJb a itip, wfiidi 
had enabled the Great Galactic fo 
capture so many of them. But now 
another shipload of Dree^ was 
due; and this time there was no 
trap. 

Professor Ungarn was speaking: 
"Did you get that part machined 
before Leigh tied you up?” He 
broke off: "WhaPs the matter, 
Steve?” 

"Huh I Nothing.” Hanardy came 
out of a depth of wonderment: "I’d 
better get onto that job. ItTl take 
a half hour, maybe.” 

Professor Ungam nodded and 
said matter-of-factly: "I’ll feel 

better when we get that additional 
screen up. There^s quite a gang 
out there.” 

Hanardy parted his lips to say 
that that particular "gang” was no 
longer a problem, but that another 
super-ship, a late arrival, would 
shortly appear on the scene. He 
stopped the words, unspoken; and 
now he was consciously dismayed. 
"What’s going on?” he wondered. 
"Am I nuts?” 

Almost blank, he headed down to 
the machine shop. As he entered, 
he saw the ropes that heul boimd 
him, lying on the floor. He walk- 
ed over in a haze of interest and 
stooped to pick up one of the short 
sections. 

It came apart in his fingers, 
breaking into a fine, powdery stuff, 
some of whidi drift^ into his nos- 
trils. He sneezed nc^sily. 



THE PROXY INTELLIGENCE 



73 




'^he rope, he discovered, was all 
^ like that. He could hardly 
get over it. He kept picking up the 
pieces, just so that he could feel 
them crumble. When he had noth- 
ing but a scattering of dust, he 
stood up and started on the lathe 
job. He thought absently: ^^If that 
next batch of Dreeghs arrives, 
then maybe I can start believing 
all this stuff.” 

He paused and for the first time 
thought: ^^Now, where did I get 
that name, Dreegh?” 

Instantly, he was trembling so 
violently that he had to stop work. 
Because — if he could get the pro- 
fessor to admit that that was what 
they were — Dreeghs — then. 

Then what? 

''Why, it’d prove everything,” he 
thought. "Just that one thing!” 

Already, the crumbled rope, and 
whatever it proved, was fading into 
the background of his recollection, 
no longer quite real, needing to be 
reinforced by some new miracle. 
As it happened, he asked the 
question under optimum circum- 
stances. He handed the part to the 
scientist and managed to ask 
about the Dreeghs as the older 
man was turning away, Ungarn be- 
gan immediately with an obvious 
urgency to work on the shattered 
section of the energy screen drive. 
It was from there, intent on what 
he was doing, and in an absent- 
minded tone, that he answered 
Hanardy’s question. 



"Yes, yes,” he muttered. 
"Dreeghs. Vampires, in the worst 
sense of the word . but they 
look just like us.” 

At that point he seemed to real- 
ize to whom he was talking. He 
stopped what he was doing and 
swung around and stared at Han- 
ardy. 

He said at last very islowly, 
"Steve, don’t repeat everything you 
hear around this place. The uni- 
verse is a bigger territory than you 
might think but people will ridi- 
cule if you try to tell them. They 
will say you’re crazy. 

Hanardy did not move. He was 
thinking: "He just don’t realize. I 
gotta know. All this stuff happen- 
ing — ” 

But the idea of not telling was 
easy to grasp. At Spaceport, on the 
moon, Europa, at the bars that he 
frequented, he was accepted by 
certain hangers-on as a boon com- 
panion. Some of the people were 
sharp, even educated, but they were 
cynical, and often witty, and were 
particularly scathing of serious 
ideas. 

Hanardy visualized himself 
telling any one of them that there 
was more to space than the solar 
system — more life, more intelli- 
gence — and he could imagine the 
ridiculing discussion that would be- 
gin. 

Though they usually treated him 
with tolerance — it sure wouldn’t 
do any good to tell them. 



74 



IF 




H anardy started for the door. 

”I gotta know,” he thought 
again. ”And right now I’d better 
get on my ship and beat it before 
that Dreegh comes along pretend- 
ing that he’s Pat’s future hus- 
band.” 

And he’d better leave on the 
sly. The professor and the girl 
wouldn’t like him to go away now. 
But defending this meteorite was 
their job, not his. They couldn’t 
expect him to deal with the Dreegh 
who had captured, and murdered, 
Pat’s boy friend. 

Hanardy stopped in the doorway, 
and felt blank. «Huhl” he said 
aloud. 

He thought: Maybe I should tell 
them. They won’t be able to deal 
with the Dreegh if they think he’s 
somebody else. 

''Steve!” It was Professor Un- 
gam. 

Hanardy turned. "Yeah, boss?” 
he began. 

"Finish unloading yom cargo.” 
"Okay, boss.” 

He walked off heavily along the 
corridor, tired and glad that he 
had been told to go and relieved 
that the decision to tell them could 
not be put into effect immediately. 
He thought wearily: First thing 
I’d better do is take a nap. 

Ill 

TTanady walked slowly up the 
ramp into his own ship, and 



so to his own cabin. Before lying 
down for the sleep he needed, he 
paused to stare at his reflection in 
the mirror-bright metal wall of 
the room. He saw a short, muscular 
man in greasy, gray dungarees, 
and a dirty yellow shirt. A stubble 
of beard emphasized a coarseness 
of features that he had seen be- 
fore, but somehow never so dearly, 
never with such a conviction that 
he was a low-grade human being. 
Hanardy groaned and stretched 
out in the bunk. He thought: I sure 
got my eyes open all of a sudden 
to what kind of a lug I am. 

He took a quick look back along 
the track of years, and groaned 
again. It was a picture of a man 
who had down-graded himself as 
a human being, seeking escape in 
a lonely space job from the need to 
compete as an individual. 

"Nobody will believe a word I 
say,” he thought. "All that other 
junk was only in my noo(fle — it 
didn’t happen out where you could 
prove anything. I’d better just keep 
my mouth shut and stop tlnnking 
I understand what’s going on.” 

He closed his eyes — and look- 
ed with a clear inner vision at the 
universe. 

He opened his eyes to realize 
that he had slept. 

He realized something eke. The 
screens were down; a Dee^ in a 
spaceboat was coming into an air- 
lock at the extreme lower side of 
the meteorite. 



THE PROXY fNTELLIGENCE 



75 




The vampire was primarily in- 
tent on informatian, but he would 
destroy everyone in the meteorite! 
as soon as he felt it was safe. 

Sweating Hanardy tumbled oufi 
of the bunk and hurried out of his 
ship, and so into the meteorite. He 
raced along the corridor that led to 
the other airlock. At the entrance 
he met the professor and Patricia. 
They were smiling and excited. 

The scientist said, Great news, 
Steve. PaPs fiance has just ar- 
rived. He’s here sooner than we 
expected; but we were getting wor- 
ried that we hadn’t received some 
communication.” 

Hanardy muttered something, 
feeling immensely foolish. To have 
been so wrong I To have thought: 
DreeghI — when the reality was — 
Klugg ... the girl’s Icmg-awaited 
fianc6, Thadled Madro. 

But the identification of the new 
arrival made all his fantasies just 
that — unreal vaporings, figments 
of an imsettled mind. 

T T anardy watched gloomily as 
Madro came down the ramp 
from the lifeboat. The girl’s lover 
was a very tall, slim man in his 
thirties, with deep-set eyes. He had 
an intensity about him that was 
impressive, commanding — and re- 
pellent. Instantly repellent. 

Hanardy realized ruefully that 
his reaction was ovar-critical. 
Hanardy coiddn’t decide what had 
twisted this man. But he was re- 



minded of the degraded people 
who were his principal buddies at 
^aceport, on Europa. Smart, many 
of them were — almost too smart. 
But they gave off this same ema- 
nation of an overloaded personality. 

Hanardy was a little surpris^ 
to realize that the girl was not 
rushing forward to greet the gaunt- 
bodied visitor. It was Professor 
Ungam, who approached the man 
and bowed courteously. Madro bow- 
ed in return and then stood look- 
ing at the girl who waited stiffly 
near Hanardy. The scientist 
glanced at his daughter and then 
smiled at the newcomer apologet- 
ically. He said, Thadled Madro, 
this is my daughter, Patricia — 
who has suddenly become very 
shy.” 

Madro bowed. Patricia inclined 
her head. Her father turned to her, 
and said, ''My dear, I realize that 
this is an unfortunate way of mar- 
rying and giving in marriage — 
to entrust yourself to a man whom 
neither of us has ever seen before. 
But let us remember his courage 
in coming hwe at all and resolve 
to offer him communication and 
the opportunity to show us what he 
is.” 

Madro bowed to the girl. "On 
those terms, I greet you, Patricia.” 
He straightened. "About communi- 
cation — I am baffled by the mes- 
sage I received en route. Will you 
please give me further informa- 
tion?”

IF 




Professor XJngam {old him of 
the Dreegh attack and of its 
abrupt cessation; he told him of 
William Leigh, the Great Galactic. 
He finished: ”We have our report 
as to what happened from a mem- 
ber of the race of this system — 
who was somehow infect^ by the 
mere presence of this mighty be- 
ing, and who apparently acquired 
the ability to see at a distance, and 
to be aware of some of the thoughts 
of some people, temporarily at 
kast.^’ 

There was a faint smile on Un- 
gam’s tired face. Hanardy shriy- 
ded a little inside, feding that he 
was being made fun oL He looked 
nnhappily at the girl She must 
have told her father what he had 
said. 

Patricia Ungam caught his gaze 
bn her and shmgged. ^'Yon said it, 
JSteve,” die stated matter-of-factly. 
^'Why not tell us everything you 
fdt?” 

The newcomer stared somberly 
and intently at Hanardy; so in- 
tently that it was almost as if he 
also were reading minds. He turn- 
ied dowly to the girL **Can you give 
me a swift summary?” he asked. 
*'If there’s action to be taken, I’d 
like to have some basis for it.” 

There was a hard note in his 
voice that chilled Hanardy, who 
had been thinking for many min- 
utes over and over: They dorit re- 
ally know him I They donH know 
him. ... He had a mental picture 



of the real Madro’s ship being in- 
tercepted, Madro captured and 
drained of information and then 
murdered by the vampire method. 
The rest was skillful makeup, good 
enough apparently to pass the in- 
spection of the professor and his 
perceptive daughter. Which meant 
that, before killing the real Madro, 
the Dreegh had learned passwords, 
secret codes and enough back his- 
tory to be convincing. 

Within minutes, this creature 
could decide that it was safe to 
take action. 

TTanardy had no illusions, no 
hope. It had taken an un- 
bounded being to defeat these 
mighty Dreeghs. And now, by a 
trick, a late arrival had achieved 
what his fellows enmasse had not 
been able to do — he had gotten 
into the meteorite fortress of the 
galactic watcher of the solar sys- 
tem; and his whole manner indi- 
cated that his fears had nothing 
to do with cither the professor 
or his daughter, or Hanardy. 

He wanted to know what had 
happened. For a little while he 
might be forbearing, in the belief 
that he could learn more as an ap- 
parent ally than as a revealed en- 
emy. 

*^We have to put him off,” Han- 
ardy thought in agony. ''We have 
to hold back, or maybe give him 
what he wants.” Somehow, the lat- 
ter seemed preferable. 



THE PROXY INTEUIGENCE

He grew aware that the girl was 
talking. While Hanardy listened, 
she gave the essential picture of 
what he had said. It was all there, 
surprisingly sharp in detail. It 
even penetrated some of the blur 
that had settled over his own 
memory. 

When she had finished, Madro 
frowned and nodded. His slim body 
seemed unnaturally tense. He said, 
almost to himself: ^'So they were 
almost all captured — ” He paused 
and, turning, looked at Hanardy. 
"You have the feeling there will be 
one more ship?” 

Hanardy nodded, not trusting 
himself to speak. 

"How many Dreeghs are there 
aboard this one ship?” Madro ask- 
ed. 

This time there was no escaping 
a verbal reply. "Nine,” said Han- 
ardy. 

He hadn’t thought about the ex- 
act number before. But he knew 
the figure was correct. Just for a 
momwit, he knew it. 

Madro said in an odd tone, "You 
get it that clearly? Then you must 
already know many other things as 
weU.” 

His dark .eyes gazed directly in- 
to Hanardy’s. The unspoken mean- 
ing that was in them seemed to be: 
"Then you already know who I 
am?” 

There was such a h3rpnotic qual- 
ity in the other’s look that Han- 
ardy had to wage an inner fight 



against admitting that he knew. 

Madro spoke again. "Were these 
— this first group of Dreeghs — 
all kiUed?” 

"Why, I — ” Hanardy stopped, 
amazed. "Gee, I don’t know. I don’t 
know what happened to them. But 
he intended to kill them; up to a 
certain moment, he intend^ to; 
and then — ” 

"And then what, Steve?” That 
was Pat, her voice urging him. 

"I don’t know. He noticed some- 
thing.” 

"Who noticed something?” asked 
Pat. 

"Leigh. You know — him. But 
I don’t know what he did after 
that.” 

"But where could they be now?” 
the girl asked, bewilder^. 

Hanardy remained blank, vague- 
ly guilty, as if somehow he was 
failing her by not knowing. 

He grew aware that Madro was 
turning away. "There is apparently 
more to discover here,” the Dreegh 
said quietly. "It is evident that we 
must re-assess our entire situation; 
and I might even guess that we 
Kluggs could through the chance 
perceptive stimulation of this man 
achieve so great a knowledge of 
the universe that, here and now, 
we might be able to take the next 
step of development for our kind.” 

^^he comment seemed to indicate 
that the Dreegh was still un- 
decided. Hanardy followed along 



78 



IF 




behind the others. For a few des- 
perate seconds he thought of jerk- 
ing out his gun, in the hope that 
he might be able to fire before the 
Dreegh could defend himself. 

But already doubt was upon him. 
For this suspicion was just in his 
head. He had no proof other than 
the steady stream of . pictures in 
his mind; and that was like a mad- 
ness having no relation to any- 
thing that had been said and done 
before his eyes. Crazy people might 
act on such inner pictures, but not 
stolid, unimaginative Steve Han- 
ardy. 

''Gotta keep my feet on the 
ground!” Hanardy muttered to 
hiimself. 

Ahead, Professor Ungam said in 
a conversational voice: "IVe got 
to give you credit, Thadled. You 
have already said something that 
has shocked Pat and myself. You 
have used the hateful word "Klugg” 
just as if it doesn’t bother you.” 

"It’s just a word,” said Madro. 

And that was all that was said 
while they walked. They came to 
the power room. The girl sank in- 
to a chair, while her father and 
the visitor walked over to the pow- 
er control board. "The screens are 
working beautifully,” said Profes- 
sor Ungarn with satisfaction. "I 
just opened them for the few sec- 
onds it took for you to get through 
them. We’ve got time to decide 
what to do, in case this last Dreegh 
ship attacks us.” 



Madro walked over near the girl, 
and settled into a chair. He address- 
ed Professor Ungarn, "What you 
said a moment ago, about the word 
and the identification of Klugg — 
you’re right. It doesn’t bother me.” 

The scientist said grimly, "Aren’t 
you fooling yourself a little? Of all 
the races that know of the galactic 
civilization, we’re the lowest on the 
scale. We do the hard work. We’re 
like the day laborers on planets 
such as Earth. Why, when Pat 
found out, she nearly went mad 
with self-negation. Galactic mo- 
rons!” He shuddered. 

Madro laughed in a relaxed way; 
and Hanardy had to admire the 
easiness of him. If Madro was a 
Dreegh, then for all Madro knew 
this, also, was a trap set by the 
Great Galactic; and yet he seemed 
unworried. If, on the other hand, 
he was actually a Klu^, then 
somehow he had made inferiority 
right within himsdf. "I could use 
some of that,” Hanardy thought 
gloomily. "If these guys are ga- 
lactic morons, what does that make 
me?” 

Madro was speaking: "We’re what 
we are,” he said simply. "It’s not 
really a matter of too much dif- 
ference in intelligence. It’s an en- 
ergy difference. There’s a way here, 
somewhere, of utilizing energy in 
a very superior fashion. But 
you’ve got to have the energy, 
and you’ve got to get it from 
somewhere. That’s what makes the

case of this fellow Leigh interest- 
ing. If we could backtrack on 
what he did here, we might really 
get at the heart of a lot of things.” 
Patricia and her father said noth- 
ing. But there eyes glistened, as 
they waited for the man to con- 
tinue. Madro turned to Hanardy. 
'^That question she asked you be- 
fore — ” he indicated the girl — 
"when you first untied her. How 
did he leave the solar system after 
capturing those — Dreeghs?” He 
hesitated the slightest bit before 
using the name. 

Hanardy said simply, "He didnH 
exactly leave. IPs more like . 
he was somewhere else. And he took 
them with him.” He fumbled for 
words. "You see, things aren’t the 
way they seem. They’re ” He 
stopped, unhappy. 

He realized that the two men 
and the girl were waiting. Hanardy 
waved his arms aimlessly, indi- 
cating things beyond the safe- 
guarding of the meteorite. "All that 
— that’s not real.” 

M adro turned towards his com- 
panions. "It’s the concept of 
a universe of illusion. An 
old idea; but maybe we should 
take another look at it.” 

Professor Ungarn murmured, "It 
would take complex techniques to 
make it work.” 

Hanardy said straining for 
meaning, "You just keep putting 
it out there. As if you’re doing it, 



even though you’re not. That times 
you in.” 

"Put what out, Steve?” It was 
the girl, her voice as strained as 
his. 

"The world. The universe • . 
the whole deal” 

"Oh!” 

Hanardy went on, "And then, 
for a moment, you don’t put any- 
thing there. That’s when you do 
something I don’t understand.” 

"WTiat’s that?” The girls’ voice 
almost emotionless, led him for- 
ward. 

"You stop everything,” said 
Hanardy wonderingly. "You let the 
nothingness rush in. And then — 
you become the real you ... for 
as long as you have energy.” 

He stared at the three people, 
through them, unseeing. As from a 
distance, Madro’s voice came to 
him: 

"You see — it’s a matter of en- 
ergy,” the man said calmly. "Han- 
ardy?” 

He came back into the room, 
mentally as well as physically. 
"Yeah?” 

"Where did he get his energy?” 
Madro asked. 

"Uh,” said Hanardy, "he got 
most of it out where it was stored 
— a kind of dark room.” 

It was a new thought; a picture 
came with it of how the energy 
bad been put there by somebody 
else, not by Leigh. Before Han- 
ardy could speak another word. 



THE PROXY INTELLIGENCE 



81 




Madro was over there beside him. 

"Show us! ” he said, and his voice 
was like a fire,^ burning a path of 
action, demanding counter-action. 

Hanardy led the way, his heavy 
body trembling. He had the feel- 
ing that he had made an admission 
that spelled victory for the Dreegh. 
But there was no turning back. If 
this creature was a Dreegh, then re- 
sistance was useless. He knew that 
intuitively. 

"If I could only be sure,” Han- 
ardy thought miserably. 

And the stupid thing was that 
he was sure. As sure, it seemed to 
him, as he could ever be. But he 
wasn^t sure enough even to make 
the attempt to save his own life. 
As things stood, he’d have to go 
through with this farce until the 
Dreegh — satisfied that all was 
well — destroyed them all in his 
own good time. 

IV 

t was twenty minutes later. 

. After they had found the 
little black room to be merely a 
drab closet where the professor had 
always kept certain tools, but oth- 
erwise empty. 

"Where was it stored?” Madro 
demanded of Hanardy. "I mean 
the energy that Leigh got.” 

Hanardy pointed unhappily at 
the metal w^ inside the doset. 

"Are you saying the energy was 
in the wall?” 



The question once more disturb- 
ed Hanardy’s sense of the reality 
of his own thoughts, and so he 
simply stood there, shaken, as Pat 
and Professor Ungarn pressed for- 
ward and with a portable instru- 
ment tested the wall. 

Madro did not join them, nor 
did he again look into the little 
room. Hanardy felt an inner tre- 
mor as the Dreegh, ignoring what 
the father and daughter were do- 
ing, turned and strode toward him. 

"Steve,” he said, "I want to 
talk to you.” 

He glanced back, raised his 
voice, "I’m going to take Han- 
ardy for a little private question- 
ing.” 

"All right!” That was Pat. But 
neither she nor her father turned. 
Madro had not waited. His fingers 
gripped Hanardy’s arm firmly at 
the elbow. Shrinking, Hanardy re- 
alized the other’s intent. 

A test! 

To determine how vulnerable he 
was. 

To the death — if he were that 
weak. 

Even as Hanardy had these 
awarenesses, Madro drew him 
away from the storeroom and 
around a corner. Hanardy kept 
looking back, not daring to call 
for help but yet hoping that the 
professor and his daughter would 
be motivated to follow. 

His final view of them showed 
them still inside the closet, and 



82 



IF 




the professor was saying, ”A se- 
ries of tests on this wall diould — ” 

Hanardy wondered what they 
would think when they found him 
gone — and dead. 

Madro drew Hanardy along the 
side corridor and into a room. He 
closed the ' door, and they were 
alone. Hanardy still not resisting. 

Madro stood there for a few mo- 
ments, tall, lean, smiling. 

"Let’s settle this once and for 
all,” he said softly. "Myself — 
against whatever ability you were 
endowed with.” 

And because Hanardy had begun 
to have fantasies, had nurtured a 
tiny hope that maybe it was true, 
that maybe something great had 
rubbed off on him — as Professor 
Ungarn had implied — for a few 
seconds, Hanardy actually waited 
for that something inside him to 
handle this situation. 

'^hat was all the time he had — 
seconds. The speed of Madro’s 
attack, and the total violent intent 
of it, instantly defeated that wait- 
ing reaction. 

He was lifted effortlessly, grab- 
bed by one foot, held like a rag 
doll, and incredibly was about to 
have his head dashed against the 
near wall — when, with a primi- 
tive survival spasm of effort, Han- 
ardy kicked with his other foot, 
ki(ied hard against the wrist of 
the hand by which Madro held 
him. 



For that moment, for that one 
attack, it was resistance enough. 
The Dreegh let him go. Hanardy 
fell — the slow-motion fall of less 
than Earth gravity. Far too slow 
for the speed of Madro’s second 
attack. 

In his awkward, muscle-bound 
way, only one of Hanardy’s drag- 
ging legs actually struck the floor. 
The next moment he was caught 
again by fingers that were like 
granite biting into his clothes and 
body — Madro obviously neither 
heeding nor caring which. 

And there was no longer any 
doubt in Hanardy ’s mind. He had 
no special ability by which he 
might defeat the Dreegh’s deadly 
intent. 

He had no inner resources. No 
visions. He was helpless. His hard 
muscles were like putty in the 
steely grip of a man whose strength 
overwhelmingly transcended his 
own. 

Hanardy ceased his writhing and 
yelled desperately, "For Pete’s 
sake, why all this murder when 
there’s only five women Dreeghs 
and four men left? Why don’t you 
Dreeghs change, try once more to 
become normal?” 

As swiftly as it had started, the 
the violence ended. 

Madro let him go, stepped back 
and stared at him. "A message I” 
he said. "So that’s your role.” 

Hanardy did not immediately 



THE MK)XY INTELLIGENCE 



83 




realize that the threat was ended. 
He had fallen to the floor. From 
that begging position he continued 
his appeal. ”You don’t have to kill 
me! I’ll keep my mouth shut. 
Who’d believe me, an5np7ay?” 
What’s normal?” The Dreegh’s 
voice was cold and demanding. 
The radiation from him — unclean- 
ness — was stronger. 

*^Me,” said Hanardy. 

^^You!” Incredulous tone. 

^^Yeah, me.” Hanardy spoke ur- 
gently. '^What ails me is that I’m 
a low-lifer, somehow. But I’m a 
normal lug. Things balance out in 
me — that’s the key. I take a 
drink, but not because I have to. 
It doejSn’t affect me particularly. 
When I was in my teens once I 
tried taking drugs. Hell, I just fdt 
it didn’t fit in my b^y. I just 
threw it off. That’s normal. You 
can’t do that with what yov^ve 
got.” 

"What’s normal?” Madro was 
cold, steady, remote. 

"You’re sick,” said Hanardy. 
"All that blood and life energy. It’s 
abnormal. Not really necessary. 
You can be cured.” 

Having spoken the strange words, 
Hanardy realized their strangeness. 
He blinked. 

"I didn’t know I was going to 
say that,” he mumbled. 

The Dreegh’s expression was 
changing as he listened. Suddenly 
he nodded and said aloud, "I ac- 
tually believe we’ve been given a 



communication from the Great 
Galactic. A twelfth-hour, last- 
chance offer.” 

"What will you do with me?” 
Hanardy miunbled. 

"The question,” came the steely 
reply, "is what is the best way to 
neutralize you? I choose this wayl” 

A metallic something glittered in 
the Dreegh’s hand. From its muz- 
zle a shimmering line of light 
reached toward Hanardy’s head. 

The spaceman flinched, tried to 
duck, had the cringing thought 
that this was death and stood there 
expecting at the very least a ter- 
rible shock. 

He felt nothing. The light hit 
his face; and it was as if a pencil 
beam from a bright flashlight had 
briefly glared into his eyes. Then 
the light went, and there he stood 
blinking a little, but unhurt so far 
as he could determine. 

He was still standing there when 
the Dreegh said, "What you and I 
are going to do now is that you’re 
going to come with me and show 
me all the places on this meteorite 
where there are armaments or small 
arms of any kind.” 

T Tanardv walked ahead, kept 
glancing back; and there, each 
time he looked, was the long body 
with its grim face. 

The resemblance to Thadled 
Madro was visibly fading, as if the 
other had actually twisted his fea- 
tures into a duplication of the 



84 



IF 




young male Elugg’s face, not using 
makeup at and now lie was re- 
laxing. 

They came to where the Ungams 
waited. Father and daughter said 
nothing at all. To Hanardy they 
seemed subdued; the girl was 
Strangely pale. He thought: ”They 
do knowl’* 

The overt revelation came as 
the four of them arrived in the 
main living quarters. Professor Un- 
garn sighed, turned and — ignor- 
ing Hanardy — said, "Well, Mr. 
Ureegh, my daughter and I are 
wondering why the delay in our 
execution?” 

"Hanardy 1” was the reply. 

Having uttered the name, as if 
Hanardy himself w^e not pres- 
ent, the Dreegh stood for a long 
moment, eyes narrowed, lips di^t- 
ly parted, even white teeth damp- 
ed together. The result was a kind 
of a snarling smile. 

"He seems to be under your 
control. Is he?” That was Pat Un- 
garn, in a small voice. The moment 
she had spoken, and thus attracted 
the Dreegh^s attention, she shrank, 
actually retreated a few steps, as 
he looked at her. 

Sween-Madro^s tense body relax- 
ed. But his smile was as grim as 
ever. And still he ignored Hanar- 
dy’s presence. 

"I gave Steve a special type of 
energy charge that will nullify for 
the time being what was done to 
him.” 



Professor Ungarn laughed curt- 
ly. "Do you really believe that you 
can defeat this — this being — 
William Leigh . , defeat him with 
what you have done to Steve? Af- 
ter all, he’s your real opponent, not 
Hanardy. This is a shadow battle. 
One of the fighters has left a pup- 
pet to strike his blows for him.” 

Sween-Madro said in an even 
tone, "It’s not as dangerous as it 
seems. Puppets are notoriously poor 
fighters.” 

The professor argued, "any in- 
dividual of the race known to less- 
er races as Great Galactics — 
which was obviously not their real 
name — must be presumed to have 
taken all such possibilities into ac- 
count. What can you gain by de- 
lay?” 

Sween-Madro hesitated, then: 
"Steve mentioned a possible cure 
for our condition.” His voice held 
an edge in it. 

There was a sudden silence. It 
settled over the room and seemed 
to permeate the four people in it. 

The soundless time was broken 
by a curt laugh from Sween-Madro. 
He said, "I sensed that for a few 
seconds I seemed — ” 

"Human,” said Pat Ungarn. "As 
if you had feelings and hopes and 
desires like us.” 

"Don’t count on it.” The 
Dreegh’s voice was harsh. 

Professor Ungarn said slowly, "I 
suspect that you analyzed Steve 
has a memory of mental contact 



THE PROXY INTELLIGENCE 



85 




with a supreme, perhaps even an 
ultimate, intelligence. Now, these 
earth people when awake are in 
that peculiar, perennially confused 
state that makes them unaccept* 
able for galactic citizenship. So 
that the very best way to defend 
yourself from Steve’s memory is to 
keep him awake. I therefore deduce 
that the energy charge you fired 
at him was designed to maintain 
in continuous stimulation the wak- 
ing center in the brain stem. 

'^But that is only a temporary 
defense. In four or five days, ex- 
haustion in Hanardy would reach 
an extreme state, and something in 
the body would have to give. What 
will you have then that you don’t 
have now?” 

The Dreegh seemed surprisingly 
willing to answer, as if by utter- 
ing his explanations aloud he could 
listen to them himself, and so 
judge them. 

He said, '^My colleagues will 
have arrived by then.” 

”So then you’re all in the trap,” 
said Professor Ungarn. 'T think 
your safest bet would be to kill 
Pat and me right now. As for 
Steve — ” 

Hanardy had been listening to 
the interchange with a growing 
conviction that this melancholy old 
man was arguing them all into be- 
ing immediately executed. 

”Heyl” he interrupted urgent- 
ly. '^What are yon tr^ng to do?” 

The scientist waved at him im- 



patiently. ''Shut up. Steve. Surely 
you re^ze that this Dreegh will 
kill without mercy. I’m trying to 
find out why he’s holding off. It 
doesn’t fit with what I consider 
to be good sense.” 

He broke off, "Don’t worry 
about him killing you. He doesn’t 
dare. You’re safe.” 

Hanardy felt extremely unsafe. 
Nevertheless, he had a long his- 
tory of accepting orders from this 
man; so he remained dutifully si- 
lent. 

The Dreegh, who had listened to 
the brief interchange thoughtfully, 
said in an even tone that when his 
companions arrived, he, Hanardy 
and Pat Ungam would go to Eu- 
ropa. He believed Pat was needed 
on such a jotimey. So no one would 
be killed until it was over. 

"I’m remembering,” Sween- 
Madro continued, "what Steve 
said about the Great Galactic no- 
ticing something. I deduce that 
what he noticed had to do with 
Steve himself. So we’ll go to Space- 
port and study Steve’s past beha- 
vior there. Ri^t now, let’s disarm 
the entire place for my peace of 
mind.” 

Clearly, it would not be for 
anyone rise’s. 

F rom room to room, and along 
each corridor, silently the 
three prisoners accompanied their 
powerful conqueror. 

And presently every weapon in 

IF 



86 




the meteorite was neutralized or 
disposed of. Even energy sources 
that might be converted were seal- 
ed off. Thus, the meteorite screens 
were actually de-energized and the 
machinery to operate them, wreck- 
ed. 

The Dreegh next cut off escape 
possibilities by dismantling several 
tiny space boats. The last place 
they went, first Hanardy, then the 
professor, then Pat, and finally 
Sween-Madro, was Hanardy’s 
space freighter. There also, all the 
weapons were eliminated, and the 
Dreegh had Hanardy dismantle 
the control board. From the parts 
that were presently lying over the 
floor, the gaunt man, with unerring 
understanding, selected key items. 
With these in hand, he paused in 
the doorway. His baleful gaze 
caught Hanardy’s shifting eyes. 
'^Stevel” he said. You’ll stay 
right hwe.” 

”You mean, inside my ship?” 

^'Yes. If you leave here for any 
reason. I’ll kill you. Do you under- 
stand?” 

Hanardy glanced helplessly to- 
ward Professor Ungarn and then 
back at the Dreegh. He said. 
There’s some work the professor 
wanted me to do.” 

^'Professor Ungarn — ” it was 
the vampire’s harsh voice cutting 
across Hanardy’s uncertain protest 
— ”tell him how xmimportant such 
work is.” 

Hanardy was briefly aware of 
THE PROXY INTELLIGENCE 



the old man’s wan smile. The sci- 
entist said wearily, 'Tat and I 
will be killed as soon as we have 
served our purpose. What he will 
eventually do with you, we don’t 
know.” 

"So you’ll stay right here. You 
two come with me,” Sween-Madro 
ordered the professor and his 
daughter. 

They went as silently as they 
had come. The airlock door clang- 
ed. Hanardy could hear the inter- 
locking steel bolts wheeze into po- 
sition. After that, no sound came. 

The potentially most intelligent 
man in the solar system was alone 
— and wide awake. 

V 

Qitting, or lying down, waiting 
^ posed no problems for Hanar- 
dy. His years alone in space had 
prepared him for the ordeal that 
now began. There was a difference. 

As he presently discovered when 
he lay down in his narrow cot, he 
couldn’t sleep. 

Twenty-four earth hours ticked 
by. 

Not a thinking man, Steve Han- 
ardy; nor a reader. The four books 
on board were repair manuals. He 
had thumbed through them a hun- 
dred times, but now he got them 
out and examined them again. Ev- 
ery page was, as he had expected, 
dully familiar. After a slow hour 
he used up their possibilities. 

87 




Another 9ay, and still he was 
^de-eyed and iindeeping, but 
.there was a devdoping restlessness 
in him, and exhaustion. 

As a spaceman, Hanardy had re- 
ceived indoctrination in the dangers 
of sleeplessness. He knew of the 
mind’s tendency to dream while 
awake, the h^ucinatory experi- 
ences, the normal effects of the un- 
ending strain of wakefulness. 

Nothing like that happened. 

He did not know that the sleep 
center in his brain was timdessly 
depressed and the wake center 
timdessly stimulated. The former 
could not turn on, the latter could 
not turn off. So between them 
there could be none of the usual 
interplay with its twilight states. 

But he could become more ex- 
hausted. 

Though he was lying down al- 
most continuously now, he became 
continually more exhausted. 

On the fourth ^morning" he had 
the thought for the first time: this 
is going to drive me crazy! 

Such a fear had never before in 
his whole life passed through his 
mind. By late afternoon of that 
day, Hanardy was scared and diz- 
zy and hopeless, in a severe dwin- 
dling spiral of decreasing sanity. 
What he would have done had he 
remained alone was not at that 
time brought to a test. 

For late on that fourth "day” 
Pat Ungarn came through the air- 
lock, found him cowering in his 



bunk and said, "Steve, come with 
me. It’s time we took ^on.” 

TTanardy stumbled to his feet. 

He was actually heading after 
her when he remembered Sween- 
Madro’s orders to him, and he 
stopped. 

"What’s the matter?” she de- 
manded. 

He miunbled simply, "He told 
me not to leave my ship. He’ll kill 
me if I do.” 

The girl was instantly impatirat. 
"Steve, stop this nonsense.” Her 
sharp words were like blows strik- 
ing his mind. "You haven’t any 
more to lose than we have. So come 
along!” 

And she started back throU|h 
the airlocL Hanardy stood, stun- 
ned and shaking. In a single sen- 
tence, spoken in her pre-emptory 
fashion, she challenged his man- 
hood by implication, recognized 
that the dumb love he fdt for her 
made him her dave and so re-es- 
tablished her absolute ascendency. 

Silently, tensdy, he shufflrf 
across the metal floor of the air- 
lock and moments later was in 
the forbidden meteorite. 

Feding doomed. 

The girl led the way to what 
was, in effect, the engine room of 
the meteorite. 

As Steve trailed rductantly be- 
hind her. Professor Ungarn rose up 
from a chair and came forward, 
smiling his infinitdy tired smile. 



IF 




His greeting tos, *Tat wants to 
tell you about intelligence. Do you 
know what yoiu: I.Q. is?” 

The question barely reached the 
outer ramparts of Hanardy’s at- 
tention. Following the girl along 
one corridor after another, a fear- 
ful vision had been in his mind, of 
Sween-Mardo suddenly rounding 
jthe next corner and striking him 
dead. That vision remained, but 
along with it was a growing won- 
der: Where was the Dreegh? 

The professor snapped, Steve 
do you hear me?” 

Forced to look at him, Hanardy 
was able to remember proudly 
that he belonged in the SSth per- 
centile of the human race, intelli- 
gence-wise, and that his I.Q. had 
been tested at 104. 

''The tester told me that I was 
above average,” Hanardy said in a 
tone of pleasure. Then, apologetic 
again, he added, "Of course, besfde 
you guys I’m nothing.” 

TTie old man said, "On the Klugg 
I.Q. scale you would probably rate 
higher than 104. We take into ac- 
count more factors. Your mechan- 
ical ability and spatial rdations 
skill would not be tested correctly 
by any human I.Q. test that I have 
examined.” 

He continued, "Now, Steve, I’m 
trying to explain this all to you in 
a great hurry, because some time 
in the next week you’re going to be, 
in fladies, the most intelligent man 
in the entire solar system, and 



there’s nothing anybody can do 
about it except help you use it. I 
want to prepare you.” 

Hanardy, who had anxiously sta- 
tioned himself so that he could 
keep one eye on the open door — 
and who kept expecting the mighty 
Dreegh to walk in on the little con- 
spiratorial group of lesser beings — 
shook his head hopelessly. 

"You don’t know what’s already 
happened. I can be killed. Easy. 
I’ve got no defenses.” 

He glumly described his en- 
counter with the Dreegh and told 
how helpless he had been. "There 
I was on my knees, begging, until 
I just, happened to say something 
that made him stop. Boy, he sure 
didn’t think I was unkillable,” 

T)at came forward, stood in front 
of him, and grabbed his shoul- 
ders with both hands. 

"Steve,” she said in an urgent 
voice, "above a certain point of 
I.Q. mind actually is over mat- 
ter. A being above that intelli- 
gence level cannot be killed. Not 
by bullets, nor by any circum- 
stance involving matter. Now lis- 
ten: in you is a memory of such an 
intelligence level. In manhandling 
you, the Dreegh was tr 5 dng to see 
what limited stress would do. He 
found out. He got the message 
from the Great Galactic out of 
you. 

"Steve, after that he didn’t 
dare put a bullet into you, or fire

a death-level energy beam. Because 
that would force this memory to 
the surfacel" 

In her intense purposefulness she 
tried to move him with her hands. 
But that only made Hanardy 
aware of what a girlish body she 
had. So little body, so much impe- 
rious woman — it startled him, for 
she could barely budge him, let 
alone shake him. 

She said breathlessly, "Don’t you 
see, Steve? You’re going to be king! 
Try to act accordingly.” 

"Look — ” Hanardy began, stol- 
idly. 

Rage flashed into her face. Her 
voice leaped past his interjection. 
"And if you don’t stop all this re- 
sistance, in the final issue Vll put 
a bullet into your brain myself, 
and then you’ll see.” 

Hanardy gazed into her blue 
eyes, so abruptly furious. He had a 
sinking conviction that she would 
do exactly what she threatened. In 
alarm, he said, "For Pete’s sake, 
what do you want me to do?” 

"Listen to what dad has to say I” 
she commanded. "And stop looking 
the other way. You need a high- 
speed education, and we haven’t 
got much time.” 

That last seemed > like a total 
understatement to Hanardy. His 
feeling was that he had no time at 
all. 

Awareness saved him, then. 
There was the room with its ma- 
chinery, and the old man and his 



daughter; and there was lie with 
his mind jumping with the new fear 
of her threat Hanardy had a flit- 
ting picture of the three of them 
lost forever inside this remote me- 
teorite that was just one tiny part 
of Jupiter’s colossal family of small, 
speeding particles of matter — a 
meaningless xiniverse that visibly 
had no morality or justice, because 
it included without a qualm crea- 
tures like the Dreeghs. 

As his skittering thought reached 
that dark depth, it suddenly occur- 
red to Hanardy that Pat couldn’t 
shoot him. She didn’t have a gun. 
He opened his mouth to tell her of 
her helplessness. Then closed if 
again. 

Because an opportunity might 
open up for her to obtain a weapon. 
So the threat remained, receded in 
time . but not to be dismissed. 
Nonetheless, he grew calmer. He 
still felt compelled, and jittery. 
But he stayed there and listened, 
then, to a tiny summary of the 
iStory of human intelligence and 
the attempts that had been made 
to measure it. 

Tt seemed human intelligence tests 
were based on a curve where 
the average was 100. Eadi test 
Professor Ungarn had seen reveal- 
ed an uncertainty about what con- 
stituted an intelligence factor, and 
what did not. Was the ability to 
tell left from right important to in- 
telligence? One test included it. 



90 



IF 




Should an individual be able to 
solve brain twisters? Many test- 
ers considered this trait of great 
importance. And almost all psy- 
chologists insisted on a subtle un- 
derstanding of the meaning of 
words and many of them. Skill at 
arithmetic was a universal require- 
ment. Quick observation of a va- 
riety of geometric shapes and 
forms was included. Even a general 
knowledge of world conditions and 
history was a requirement in a few 
tests. 

^'Now, we Kluggs,” continued the 
professor in his melancholy voice, 
"have gone a step beyond that,^^ 

The words droned on through 
Hanardy’s mind. Kluggs were the- 
ory-operating people . • theories 
based on primary and not second- 
ary abilities. Another race, "higher” 
than the Kluggs — called the Len- 
nels — operated on Certainty . 
a high harmonic of Authority. 

"Certainty, with the Lennels,” 
said the old man, "is of course a 
system and not an open channel 
But even so it makes them as pow- 
erful as the Dreeghs.” 

On an I.Q. curve that would in- 
clude humans, Kluggs, Lennels and 
Dreeghs, the respective averages 
would be 100, 220, 380, and 4S0. 
The Dreeghs had an open channel 
on control of physical movement. 

"Even a Great Galactic can only 
move as fast as — he cannot move 
faster than — a Dreegh,” Profes- 
sor Ungarn commented and ex- 

THE PROXY INTELLIGENCE 



plained, "Such open channels are 
pathways in the individual to a 
much greater ability than his stand- 
ard I.Q. permits.” 

Musicd, mathematical, artistic, 
or any special physical, mental or 
emotional ability was an open 
channel that operated outside the 
normal human, Klugg, or even the 
Dreegh curve. By definition, a 
Great Galactic was a person whose 
I.Q. ciurve included only open 
channels. 

^ It had been reported that the 
open channel curve began at about 
80. And, though no one among the 
lesser races had ever seen any- 
thing higher than 3,000 — the Em- 
its of the space phenomenon — it 
was believed that the Great Galac- 
tic I.Q. curve ascended by types 
to about 10,000. 

"It is impossible,” said the Pro- 
fessor’s melancholy voice, "to im- 
agine what kind of an open chan- 
nel that would be. An example of 
an 800 open channel is Pat. She 
can deceive. She can get away with 
a sleight of hand, a feint, a di- 
version — ” 

The old man stopped suddenly. 
His gaze flicked past Hanardy’s 
right shoulder and fastened on 
something behind him that Han- 
ardy couldn’t see. 

VI 

^^he spaceman froze with the 
sudden terrified conviction 

9\ 




that the worst had hi^pened, and 
that the Dre^ Sween-Madro was 
behind him. 

But it coiddn’t be, he realized. 
Professor Ungam was looking at 
the control board of the meteorite. 
There was no door there. 

Hanardy allowed himself to turn 
around. He saw that on the big 
instrument panel a viewplate had 
lighted, showing a scene of space. 

It was a familiar part of the 
starry heavens looking out toward 
interstellar space, away from the 
sun. Near the center of the scene 
a light was blinking. 

Even as Hanardy watched, the 
viewplate picture shifted slightly, 
centering exactly on the blinking 
light 

Behind Hanardy, there was a 
gasp from the girl, ”Dad,” she 
whispered, ^'is it — ?” 

Professor Ungarn had walked to- 
ward the viewplate, past Hanardy 
and so into the latter’s range of 
vision. The old man nodded with 
an air of utter weariness. 

”Yes, I’m afraid it is, my dear. 
The other eight Dreeghs have ar- 
rived.” 

He glanced hopelessly at Han- 
ardy. '^My daughter had some kind 
of idea of using you against Sween- 
Madro before they got here.” 

Hanardy said blankly, Using 
wc?” 

The meaning of that brought him 
wifli a jar out of his own body ex- 
haustion. 



The old man was shrugging. 
"Whatever the merit of hex plan, 
of course, now it’s too late.” 

He finished dully, "Now well 
learn our fate.” 

The tableau of dejection held for 
seconds only. A soimd, a high- 
pitched human voice, broke through 
the silence and the dark emotion 
that filled the room. 

"How far away are they?” It 
was the girl’s voice, from behind 
Hanardy, strained but recogniz- 
able. "Exactly how long till they 
get here?” 

Hanardy’s mind stirred from its 
thrall as Professor Ungarn said 
dully, "Less than two hours would 
be my guess. Notice — ” 

He thereupon started a technical 
comment to her about the speed 
with which the view plate had cen- 
tered on the ship, impljdng — he 
said — the enormous velocity of 
its approach. 

His explanation was never com- 
pleted. In the middle of it, the girl 
uttered a screech and then, to 
Hanardy’s amazement, she raced 
past him and flung herself, arms 
flailing, at the old man. 

She kept striking at his face 
then, yelling the most bloodcur- 
dling curses in a furious soprano 
voice. A long moment went by be- 
fore Hanardy was able to make 
out what she was sa5dng: 

" — You stupid old man! What 
do you mean, only two hours? Two 
hours is all we need, damn you! 



92 



IF 




At that point Hanardy emerged 
from his surprise. Awkwardly, 
he jumped over her, grabbed her, 
pulled her away. 'Tor Pete’s sakel” 
he cried. 

The girl tried to turn on him, 
her struggling body writhing in his 
grip. But he held her, uttering 
apologies the while. Finally, she 
realized that his strength was too 
much for her. She ceased her ef- 
forts, and with an attempt at con- 
trol said grimly, "Steve, this crazy 
old fool who is my father has 
twice now accepted defeat — when 
it wasn’t necessary 1” 

She broke off, addressed the old 
man. Her voice went up a whole 
octave as she said, "Show Steve 
what you showed me only a few 
minutes before I went to get him.” 
Professor Ungam was white and 
haggard. "I’m sorry, my dear,” he 
mumbled. He nodded to Hanardy. 
"I’m sure you can let her go now.” 
Hanardy rdeased the girl. She 
stood straightening her dothes, but 
her eyes still flashed. "Show him, 
damn it,” she snapped, "and make 
it quick.” 

Professor Ungarn look Hanar- 
dys arm and drew him toward 
the control board, speaking in apol- 
ogetic tones. "I failed my daugh- 
ter. But the truth is I’m over three 
hundred years old. That’s just 
about it for a Klugg; so I keep 
forgetting how yoimger people 
might feel.” 

Pat — he went on — was a 



product of a late-Ufe marriage. Her 
mother had flatly refused to go 
along on his assignment as a galac- 
tic watcher. In bringing the girl 
with him, he had hoped to shield 
her from the early shock of dis- 
covering that she was a member 
of a servant race. But isolation had 
not, in fact, saved her feelings. And 
now, their very remoteness from 
the safeguarding military strength 
of associated lower-level races had 
brought a horrifying threat of 
death from which he had decided 
there was no escape. 

"So it didn’t even occur to me 
to tell her — ” 

"Show him,” the girl’s voice 
came shrilly from the rear, "what 
you didn’t bother to tell me.” 

Professor Ungarn made a few 
control adjustments, and there ap- 
peared on the viewplate first a 
picture of a room and then of a 
bed in one corner with an almost 
naked man l}dng on it. 

The bed came into full focus, 
filled the viewplate. Hanardy drew 
in his breath with a sharp hiss of 
disbelief. It was the Dreegh. 

^T^he man who lay there, seem- 
ingly unconscious, bore almost 
no resemblance to the tall, vital 
being who had come aboard in the 
guise of Pat’s fiance. The body on 
the bed was unnaturally thin; the 
rib cage showed. His face, where 
it had been full-checked, was sunk- 
en and hollow. 



THE PROXY INTELLIGENCE

"Tkey need other people’s blood 
and life energy to survive, and they 
need it almost continuously,” the 
old man whispered. ” That’s what 
I wanted to show you, Steve.” 
Her tone grew scatUng, as she 
continued, ^'My father didn’t let 
me see that until a few minutes 
ago. Imagine! Here we are under 
sentence of death, and on the day, 
almost on the hour that the other 
Dree^ are due to arrive, he fi- 
nally reveals it — something he had 
watched developing for days.” 

The old man shut off the scene 
on the viewplate and sighed. 

'T’m afraid it never occurred to 
me that a Klugg could challenge a 
Dreegh. An3rway, I imagine Sween- 
Madro originally arrived here ex- 
pecting to use us as a source 
of blood and life force. And then 
when you showed all that Great 
Galactic programming, he changed 
his mind and decided to await the 
coming of his colleagues. So there 
he is — at our mercy, Pat thinks.’^ 
Hanardy had spent his years of 
association with this couple defer- 
ring to them. So he waited now, pa- 
tiently, for the scientist to tell him 
what to do about the opportunity. 

The old man said, with a sigh, 
'Tat thinks if we m^e a bold at- 
tack at this stage, we can kill him.” 
Hanardy was instantly skeptical, 
but he had never been able to in- 
fluence this father and daughter in 
any way, and he was about to follow 
the old, withdrawing pattern, when 



he remembered again that there 
were no weapons aroimd to make 
any kind of attack whatsoever. 

He pointed out that fact and was 
still talking when he felt something 
cold touch his hand. 

Startled, he glanced down and 
back — and saw that the ^rl was 
pushing a metal bar about one 
and a half feet long, at his palm. 
Involuntarily, still not thinking, 
he closed his fingers over it. As 
soon as he had it firmly in one 
chunky hand, Hanardy recognized 
by its feel that it was a special 
aluminmn alloy, hard, light, and 
tough. 

The girl spoke. "And just in case 
that dumb look on your face means 
what I think it does,” she said, 
"here are your orders: take that 
bar, go where the Dreegh is and 
beat him to death with it.” 

Hanardy turned slowly, not quite 
sure that it was he who was being 
addressed. "Me?” he said. And 
then, after a long pause, "Hey!” 

"And you’d better get started,” 
said the girl, "there isn’t much 
time.” 

" Hey I ” repeated Hanardy, 

blankly. 

VH 

Qlowly, the room swung back into 
^ a kind of balance. And Han- 
ardy grew aware that the girl was 
speaking again: 

"I’ll go in through the door fac- 



94 



IP 




ing the bed,” she stated. ”If he can 
awaken at all in his condition, I 
want to ask him some questions. 
I must know about the nature of 
super-intelligence.” 

For a brain in as dulled state as 
Hanardy’s, the words were con- 
fusing. He had been striving to ad- 
just to the idea that he was the 
one who was supposed to go in to 
the Dreegh, and simultaneously he 
was bracing himself against what 
she wanted him to do. 

With so many thoughts already 
in his mind, it was hard to get the 
picture that this slip of a girl in- 
tended to confront the Dreegh by 
herself. 

Pat was speaking again, in an ad- 
monishing tone, You stand just in- 
side the other door, Steve. Now 
listen carefully. Do your best not 
to attract his attention, which I 
hope will be on me. The informa- 
tion I want is for your benefit. But 
when I yell, ‘Come!’ don’t dday. 
You come and you kill, under- 
stand?” 

Hanardy had had a thought of 
his own. A sudden stark realiza- 
tion. The realization was that in 
this deadly dangerous situation 
there was ultimately a solution. 

He could cast off in his own 
spacecraft! 

But that meant he would have 
to obtain the key equipment Sween- 
Madro had taken from his ship. 
Obtain it, repair the control board, 
get away! 



To obtain it he’d have to go to 
where it was — into the Dreegh’s 
bedroom. At least apparently, he 
would have to do exactly what Pat 
wanted. 

Fear dimmed before that obvi- 
ous purpose, yielded to the feeling 
that there was no other way. 

Thinking thus, Hanardy abrupt- 
ly uttered agreement. ‘‘Yep,” he 
said, “I understand.” 

The girl had started toward the 
door. At the tone of his voice, she 
paused, turned back and gaz^ at 
him suspiciously. “Now, don’t you 
go having any plans of your own!” 
She spoke accusingly. 

Hanardy was instantly guilty, 
instantly confused. “For Pete’s 
sake,” he said, “I don’t like what 
you want to do — going in there 
and waking this guy. I don’t see 
any good in my listening to a lec- 
ture on intelligence. I’m not smart 
enough to imderstand it! So, my 
vote is if we’re going in let’s just 
kill him right off.” 

The girl had turned away. She 
did not glance back as she walked 
out of the room. Hanardy grim- 
aced at Professor Ungarn. Moments 
later he was through the door, fol- 
lowing her, weary, hopeless, men- 
tally shut down, but resigned. 

Pat heard him stumbling along 
behind her. Without looking around 
she said, “You’re a weapon, Steve. 
I have to figure out how to fire 
that weapon and escape. Basically, 
that’s all we need to do! Get away 



96 



IF 




from the Dreeghs and hide. Under- 
stand?” 

He was a man stumbling along 
metal and rock corridors in a re- 
mote part of the solar system^ his 
normal stoKdness made worse now 
by an immense weariness. So he 
heard the words she uttered; even 
understood their surface meaning. 

It was enough awareness for him 
to be able to mumble, '^Yeah — 
yeah!” 

Otherwise — she went on when 
he had acknowledged — he might go 
off like a firecracker, discharging 
whatever energy homchgalactic had 
endowed him with in a series of 
meaningless explosions aimed at 
nothing and accomplishing noth- 
ing. 

So the question was: What kind 
of weapon was he? 

”As I see it,” she finished, ”that 
information we can only hope to 
gain from the Dreegh. That^s why 
we have to talk to him.” 

'^Yeah,” mumbled Hanardy, 
hoarsely. ”Yeah.” 

'^hey came all too quickly to 
their destination. At the girPs 
nod Hanardy broke into an uneven 
lope and ran aroxmd to the far 
corridor. He fumbled the door 
open and stepped inside. 

At this point Pat had already 
been through her door for fifteen 
seconds. Hanardy entered upon a 
strange scene, indeed. 

On the bed, the almost naked 

THE PROXY INTELLIGENCE 



body was stirring. The eyes opened 
and stared at the girl, and she said 
breathlessly, ''That! What you just 
now did — becoming aware of me. 
How do you do that?” 

From where he stood, Hanardy 
could not see the Dreegh’s head. 
He was aware only that the Dreegh 
did not answer. 

"What,” asked Pat Ungarn, "is 
the nature of the intelligence of a 
Great Galactic?” 

The Dreegh spoke. "Pat,” he 
said, "you have no future, so why 
are you making this inquiry?” 

"I have a few days.” 

"True,” said Sween-Madro. 

He seemed unaware that there 
was a second person in the room. 
So be canH read minds! Hanardy 
exulted. For the first time he had 
hope. 

"I have a feeling,” Pat was con- 
tinuing, "that you’re at least 
slightly vulnerable in your present 
condition. So answer my question! 
Or — ” 

She left the threat and the sen- 
tence unfinished. 

Again the body on the bed shift- 
ed position. Then: 

"All right, my dear, if it’s in- 
formation you want, I’ll give you 
more than you bargained for.” 
"What do you mean?” 

"There are no Great Galactics,” 
said the Dreegh. "No such beings 
exist, as a race. To ask about their 
intelligence is — not meaningless, 
but complex.” 

97 




^^That^s ridiculous!” Pat’s tone 
was scathing. ”We saw him!” 

She half-glanced at Hanardy for 
confirmation^ and Hanardy foimd 
himself nod^ng his head in fuU 
agreement with her words. Boy, he 
sure knew there was a great Ga- 
lactic. 

On the bed, Sween-Madro sat 
up. 

''The Great Galactic is a sportl 
Just a member of some lesser race 
who was released by a chance stim- 
ulus so that he temporarily became 
a super-being. The method?” The 
Dreegh smiled coldly. "Every once 
in a while, accidentally, enough 
energy accumulates to make such 
a stimulus possible. The lucky in- 
dividual, in his super-state, realized 
the whole situation. When the ener- 
gy had been transformed by his 
own body and used up as far as 
he himself was concerned, he stored 
the transformed life-energy where 
it could eventually be used by 
someone else. The next person 
would be able to utilize the ener- 
in its converted form. Having 
gone through the energy, each re- 
cipient in turn sank back to some 
lower state. 

"Thus William Leigh, earth re- 
porter, had for a few brief hours 
been the only Great Galactic in 
this area of space. By now his 
super-ability is gone forever. And 
there is no one to replsjce him. 

"And that, of course,” said the 
Dreegh, ”is the problem with Han- 



ardy. To use his memory of intel- 
ligence in its full possibility, he’ll 
need life energy in enormous quan- 
tities. Where will he get it? He 
won’t! If we’re careful, and in- 
vestigate his background cautiously, 
we should be able to prevent Steve 
getting to any source, known or 
unknown.” 

Hanardy had listened to the ac- 
count with a developing empty 
feeling from the pit of his stom- 
ach. He saw that the color had 
drained from the girl’s face. 

"I don’t believe it,” she faltered. 
"That’s just a — ” 

S he got no further, because in 
that split instant the Dreegh 
was beside her. The sheer speed of 
his movement was amazing. Han- 
ardy, watching, had no clear mem- 
ory of the vampire actually getting 
off the bed. 

But now, belatedly, he realized 
what the Dreegh’s movements on 
the bed must have been — maneu- 
verings, re-balancings. The crea- 
ture-man had been surprised — 
had been caught in a prone, help- 
less position, but used the talk to 
brace himself for attack. 

Hanardy was miserably aware 
that Pat Ungarn was equally tak- 
en by surprise. Sween-Madro’s fin- 
gers snatched at her shoulder. With 
effortless strength, he spun her 
around to face him. His lank body 
towared above her, as he spoke.

and WHEN 

by LESTER DEL REY 



Such material as dreams are built on 



C yrus Brump knew all about me- 
teor collisions in space; he’d 
read all the science-fiction stories 
about it forty years before. There 
was always a tremendous thump, a 
shrill whistle, and a horrendous ex- 
plosion. Then the air rushed in- 
stantly into space, except where 
huge doors slammed shut to cut off 
the livable sections. 

But he wasn’t thinking of that as 
he sat in the control room of the 
Nomad with the ship’s one-man pi- 
lot-and-crew. Joe had already ex- 
plained that most meteoroids — 
they were only meteors when they 
were burning up in the atmosphere 
of a planet — were tiny grains of 
dust. 

Then Brump felt a curious jerk 
through the floor plates. Joe grunt- 
ed. ” Meteoroid hit us. Must be a 
big one — size of a small pea.” 



No doors slammed shut. The plas- 
tic lining between the thin sheets of 
soft aluminum that made up the' 
hull had a fantastic surface tensioni 
that healed any hole instantly and 
held the air. There was no sound of 
a huge explosion, because the metal 
of the floor was a ^'dumb” metal 
— one that was dead to sound and 
unable to ring. 

Joe went back to inspect the 
damage, pointing to the dark spot 
where the meteoroid had entered. 
Then he swore as he saw that the 
housing of the generator that con- 
trolled the ion rockets was badly 
twisted, and that half the stores 
were ruined by the explosion of thd 
little pebble from space. 

He hunted around until he found 
a can and began squirting it over 
the housing. In a few minutes, the 
scar across it began to fade and the? 



99 




housing had resumed its former 
shape. 

"Plastic memory,” he told 
Brump. "Lots of pieties try to get 
back to their original shape when 
distorted, but this is meant to re- 
cover from almost anything. The 
goo just speeds it up. Could do it 
with heat, but my welding torch 
doesn't get hot enough to soften 
this plastic.” 

"Then weTl be all right?” 
Brump asked doubtfully. 

Joe grimaced. "Sme. But all our 
food's gone — that was what was 
in those stores. Oh, well, I guess 
well have to eat the walls.” 

Brump stared at the panelling 
nailed in place between storage and 
engine rooms. He didn’t fancy eat- 
ing a diet of walls soaked in water 
for nearly a month. But at least 
they'd survive. Maybe it wouldn't 
be much worse than Joe’s cooking, 
at that. 

'^here is nothing fantastic about 
the above account, except per- 
haps for the idea of such a small 
ship. There are no if elements in it, 
and not too many questions of 
when. It merely involves using 
slightly improved materials of t3q>es 
already in general use today, though 
most of them would have been un- 
thinkable thirty years ago. 

The edible walls aren’t even 
evolved beyond what is now avail- 
able. Material that can be used as 
building forms — sawed, drilled 



and even nailed up — exists. It is 
made of powdered milk, hominy 
grits, cornstarch flour and dried ba- 
nana flakes. It can be shaped into 
construction boards to replace the 
usual building material for walls — 
and since it is both light and strong, 
it should serve excellently in a 
spaceship. 

The plastic housing for the gen- 
erator is a bit beyond what we have 
now, but only in degree. The days 
when plastics couldn't be placed in 
boiling water without melting are 
long gone. Many of the modern 
ones can take quite high heats, and 
some can withstand the blast of a 
blowtorch; they operate at higher 
temperatures than many of the com- 
mon metals. 

Plastic memory is also common 
enough. Contact lenses, for instance, 
have to be cut on a special lathe; 
if they were pressed into shape with 
hot dies, it would be a lot simpler 
— but the plastic would gradually 
return to its original form. (The 
softening goo, however, doesn’t yet 
exist.) And self-healing substances 
are used inside tubeless tires to seal 
up holes before the air can leak out. 

The use of laminates — or multi- 
ple layers cemented together — of 
thin sheets of aluminum and soft 
plastic as a cement was proved 
more effective against missiles than 
hard steel back in World War II. 
When a rigid shield is penetrated, 
the damage is usually ^eat; but the 
softer multi-layer shield absorbs

IF 




most of the energy of the blow in- 
side itself, and is virtually foolproof 
against rupturing. 

Almost all metal is pretty ugly 
stuff in one way, however. It rings; 
and it transmits sound. Living inside 
a spaceship of metal would normally 
be something like sitting inside a 
ringing bell. The effect can be muf- 
fled by absorbent coatings, but they 
add weight and bulk. 

This problem was tackled and 
licked by adding materials to the 
alloy which form tiny particles that 
soak up the energy of the sound. 
The result is a metal with the 
strength and toughness of steel, but 
the deadness of soft lead. 

Ocience is only just beginning to 
^ get some imderstanding of even 
the most basic nature of the ma- 
terials on which our technology is 
based. This may seem natural in the 
case of plastics, which are almost 
entirely the product of this century. 
But men have used metals for at 
least six thousand years. Alloys are 
as old as Eg3^t, and excellent steel 
was made during the Middle Ages 
— by trial and error. Nobody knew 
how to design deliberately to fit 
some special need. 

It was only a hundred years ago 
that Dr. Henry Sorbey learned how 
to study metals under high enough 
magnification to see the way the 
crystals behaved. And until the in- 
vention of the electron microscope, 
nobody could hope to go beyond the 



crystalline structure down to the. 
molecular level where most Qf jthd 
secrets are to be foimd. 

Today, we’re just on tfig verge 
of gaining real knowledge. What we 
do know would fill a dozen encyclo- 
pedias with tables and facts; and 
one of the reasons such an engineer- 
ing encyclopedia might be necessary 
is that too many of those facts 
aren’t yet reduced to a full theoreti- 
cal imderstanding of the principles 
behind them. 

Some of what we know — as well 
as the fascinating areas where we’rei 
still ignorant — is covered in a re- 
cent book issued by Basic Books. 
It’s entitled appropriately The New 
Materials and is written by David 
Fishlock. It isn’t a book that I’d 
call very exciting to read — but the 
information is so fascinating that 
I’m going back immediately to read 
it again from cover to cover. There 
are a hundred story plots in it, and 
material to change the background 
thinking of almost every imagined 
future I’ve ever read. 

The book even covers such things 
as the proper way to build a ship 
from ice. Poul Anderson used ice 
rafts to fight a war in War of the 
Wing Men, and he did his usual fine 
job of thinking it out. But sevkal 
years before, men actually worked 
out the best means for constructing 
real ice ships. 

It turned out that ice wasn’t 
strong enough. But by adding cellu- 
lose fiber — the ” slurry” that is 



IF — AND WHEN 



101 




used to make paper — to the water 
before freezing, the resulting ma- 
terial was more than 20 times as 
streng, just as light, and almost as 
cheap. Tliey even cooked up a name 
for it — Pykcrete, The only trou- 
ble was that the I^kcrete had the 
same nasty habit of melting as pure 
ice, so it didn^t work out well. 

But the experiment proved again 
what weVe been discovering for the 
past twenty years — that composite 
materials made up of two dissimilar 
materials are often fantastically bet- 
ter than any single substance. For 
instance, pl 3 rwood and fiberglass- 
plastics. But some of the materials 
are odd, indeed. Carbon doesn’t 
seem to be much use as a structural 
material. Yet when thin fibers of 
carbon are put together in parallel 
and then bonded with almost any 
of the new glues, the result is one 
of the stiffest and strongest com- 
posite materials known^ Without it, 
the lifting motors for some of the 
vertical-take-off-and-landing experi- 
mental airplanes would be impos- 
sible. 

TT^e need a lot better rocket mo- 
^ ^ tors for our spaceships. If we 
are ever to have Joe’s little ship 
capable of going from planet to 
planet, we’ll need something at least 
as good as the ion drive I mention- 
ed. 

That’s mostly just a matter of 
the right material. Ions are the 
charged parts of atoms left after 



electrons are stripped away. We 
have a substance which can be bro- 
ken down into ions and electrons 
— cesium metal, heated until it be- 
comes a gas. When this is sent 
through porous tungsten as a cata- 
lyst (or agent to break down the 
ion-electron bonds), we get a fair 
supply of ions. Once released, these 
can be driven to extremely high ve- 
locities by coils carrying an electric 
current. 

The present models aren’t effi- 
cient enough. We don’t know how 
to make our tungsten catalyst be- 
have as well as we know it should 
in theory. But we’re learning, and 
the answer must lie within the sec- 
rets just beyond what we have 
found to date. 

We haven’t found Maxwell’s de- 
mon yet, either; this was supposed 
to be an imp who sent hot molecules 
in one direction and cold ones in 
another. Effectively, it would act 
on heat as a modern silicon rectifier 
acts on electricity. Probably some 
such means exists for getting heat 
or cold as we want, if we can find 
a little more about how our mate- 
rials handle heat conduction. 

Meantime, we do have something 
that’s an almost perfect insulator in 
one direction and a good conductor 
in another. A form of carbon called 
pyrolytic graphite (formed by de- 
positing carbon under an arc) trans- 
mits heat across its grain but not 
along it. 

We have plastic films that will 

IF 



102 




conduct fresh water out of salt 
a one-way traffic, which may pro- 
vide fresh water from the sea. An- 
other thin film being developed by 
General Electric will pass oxygen 
and carbon dioxide but is imperv- 
ious to water; eventually, menwear- 
ings suits of that may work on the 
sea floor and get their oxygen di- 
rectly from that dissolved in the 
water. 

Even spacesuit design is being 
altered because of new materials. 
The latest idea calls for a thin elas- 
tic film that is not inflated, but 
hugs the skin; and it will be light- 
ly porous, so that the body temper- 
ature can be regulated by our an- 



cient and useful trick of perspiring. 

The last three inventions aren’t 
perfected yet. We have to learn a 
little more about what makes ma-. 
terials Behave as they do so t^t 
we can tailor new ones exactly as 
we want them. It took us thousands 
of years to learn the gross facts and 
another fifty to begin any deeper 
understanding of the nature of ma- 
terials. At the rate weVe been go- 
ing, it should take us another ten 
years to discover more about how 
things work than ever3dhing we 
thought we knew before the first 
Sputnik went up.

eyes just as the Sergeant snapped “Do you know that you are still 
his arm down, hurling a gleaming alive?” the Sergeant answered, a 
combat knife. Trained reflexes trace of a cold smile wrinkling the 



105 




corners of his cat's eyes. He stalk- 
ed down the gangway, hke a preda- 
tory animal, and reached for the 
handle of the knife. 

“No you don't,” Dom said, 
snatching the book away. “YouVe 
done enough damage already.” He 
put the book flat on the bunk and 
worked the knife carefully out of it 
— then threw it suddenly at the 
Sergeant's foot. 

Sgt Toth shifted his leg just 
enough so that the knife missed 
him and struck the plastic deck 
covering instead. “Temper, combat- 
man,” he said. “You shodd never 
lose your temper. That way you 
make mistakes, get killed.” He bent 
and plucked out the shining blade 
and held it balanced in his finger- 
tips. As he straightened up, there 
was a rustle as the other men 
in the barracks compartment shift- 
ed weight, ready to move, all eyes 
on him. He laughed. 

“Now you're expecting it, so it's 
too easy for you.” He slid the knife 
back into his boot sheath. 

“You're a sadistic bowb,” Dom 
said, smoothing down the cut in the 
book's cover. ” Getting a great pleas- 
ure out of frightening other peo- 
ple.” 

“Maybe,” Sgt. Toth said, undis- 
turbed. He sat on the bunk across 
the aisle. “And maybe that's what 
they call the right man in the right 
job. And it doesn't matter an)rway. 
I train you, keep you alert, on the 
jump. This keeps you alive. You 



should thank me for being such a 
good sadist.” 

“You can't sell me with that ar- 
gument, Sergeant. You're the sort 
of individual this man wrote about, 
right here in this book that you did 
your best to destroy . .” 

“Not me. You put it in front of 
the knife. Just like I keep telling 
you pinkies. Save yourself. That's 
what counts. Use any trick. You 
only got one life, make it a long 
one.” 

“Right in here . .” 

"Pictures of girls?” 

“No, Sergeant, words. Great 
words by a man you never heard 
of, by the name of Wilde.” 

"Sure. Plugger Wyld, fleet 
heav3Tweight chamiHon.” 

“No, Oscar Fingal O’Flahertie 
Wills Wilde. No relation to your 
pug — I hope. He writes ‘As long 
as war is regarded as wicked, it will 
always have its fascination. When 
it is looked upon as vulgar, it will 
cease to be popular."' 

Sgt. Toth's eyes narrowed in 
thought. “He makes it sound sim- 
ple. But it's not that way at all. 
There are other reasons for war.” 
“Such as what . .?” 

'^he Sergeant opened his mouth 
to answer, but his voice was 
drowned in the wave of sound from 
the scramble alert. The high-pitched 
hooting blared in every compart- 
ment of the spacer and had its in- 
stant response. Men moved. Fast. 




The ship^s crew raced to their 
action stations. The men who had 
been asleep just an instant before 
were still blinking awake as they 
ran. They ran and stood, and before 
the alarm was through sounding the 
great spaceship was ready. 

Not so the combatmen. Until 
ordered and dispatched, they were 
just cargo. They stood at the ready, 
a double row of silver-gray uni- 
forms, down the center of the bar- 
racks compartment. Sgt. Toth was 
at the wall, his headset plugged in- 
to a phone extension there, listening 
attentively, nodding at an unheard 
voice. Every man’s eyes were upon 
him as he spoke agreement, discon- 
nected and turned slowly to face 
them. He savored the silent mo- 
ment, then broke into the widest 
grin that any of them had ever 
seen on his normally expressionless 
face. 

‘This is it,” the Sergeant said, 
and actually rubbed his hands to- 
gether. “I can tell you now that the 
Edinburgers were expected and 
that our whole fleet is up in force. 
The scouts have detected them 
breaking out of jump space, and 
they should be here in about two 
hours. We’re going out to meet them. 
This, you pinkie combat virgins, is 
it.” A sound, like a low growl, rose 
from the assembled men, and the 
Sergeant’s grin widened. 

“That’s the right spirit. Show 
some of it to the enemy.” The grin 
vanished as quickly as it had come. 



and, cold-faced as always, he called 
the ranks to attention. 

“Corporal Stores is in sick bay 
with the fever so we’re one NCO 
short. When that alert sounded we 
went into combat condition. I may 
now make temporary field appoint- 
ments. I do so. Combatman Priego, 
one pace forward.” Dom snapped 
to attention and stepped out of the 
rank. 

“You’re now in charge of the 
bomb squad. Do the right job and 
the CO will make it permanent. 
Corporal Priego, one step back and 
wait here. The rest of you to the 
ready room, double time — marchr 

Sgt. Toth stepped aside as the 
combatmen hurri^ from the com- 
partment. When the last one had 
gone he pointed his finger sharply 
at Dom. 

“Just one word. You’re as good 
as any man here. Better than most. 
You’re smart. But you think too 
much about things that don’t mat- 
ter. Stop thinking and start fight- 
ing, or you’ll never get back to that 
university. Bowb up, and if the 
Edinburgers don’t get you I will. 
You come back as a corporal or 
you don’t come back at all. Under- 
stood?” 

“Understood.” Dorn’s face was as 
coldly expressionless as the Ser- 
geant’s. 

‘T’m just as good a combatman 
as you are. Sergeant. I’ll do my 
job.” 

“Then do it — now ]umpP 



OR BATTLE'S SOUND

■Decause of jthe delay, Dom was 
the last man to be suited up. 
The others were already doing their 
pressure checks with the armorers 
while he was still closing his seals. 
He did not let it disturb him or 
make him try to move faster. With 
slow deliberation, he counted off the 
check list as he sealed and locked. 

Once all the pressure checks were 
in the green, Dom gave the armor- 
ers the thumbs-up okay and walked 
to the air lock. While the door 
closed behind him and the lock was 
pumped out, he checked all the tell- 
tales in his helmet. Oxygen, full. 
Power pack, full charge. Radio, one 
and one. Then the last of the air 
was gone, and the inner door opened 
soundlessly in the vacuum. He en- 
tered the armory. 

The lights here were dimmer — 
and soon they would be turned off 
completely. Dom went to the rack 
with his equipment and began to 
buckle on the smaller items. Like 
all of the others on the bomb squad, 
his suit was lightly armored and he 
carried only the most essential 
weapons. The drillger went on his 
left thigh, just below his fingers, 
and the gropener in its holster on 
the outside of his right leg; this 
was his favorite weapon. The intelli- 
gence reports had stated that some 
of the Edinburgers still used fabric 
pressure suits so lightning prods — 
usually considered obsolete — had 
been issued. He i^ung his well to 
the rear, since the chance that he 



might need it was very slim. All of 
these murderous devices had been 
stored in the evacuated and insu- 
lated compartment for months so 
that their temperature approached 
absolute zero. They were free of lu- 
brication and had been designed to 
operate at this temperature. 

A helmet clicked against Dorn’s, 
and Wing spoke, his voice carried 
by the conducting transparent cera- 
mic. 

“I’m ready for my bomb, Dom — 
do you want to sling it? And con- 
gratulations. Do I have to call you 
Corporal now?” 

“Wait until we get back and it’s 
official. I take Toth’s word for ab- 
solutely nothing.” 

He slipped the first atomic bomb 
from the shelf, checked the telltales 
to see that they were all in the 
green, then slid it into the rack 
that was an integral part of Wing’s 
suit. “All set, now we can sling 
mine.” 

'^hey had just finished when a 
large man in bulky combat ar- 
mor came up. Dom would have 
known him by his size even if he 
had not read HELMUTZ stenciled 
on the front of his suit. 

“What is it. Helm?” he asked 
when their helmets touched. 

“The Sergeant. He said I should 
report to you, that I’m lifting a 
bomb on this mission.” There was 
an angry tone behind his words. 

“Right. We’ll fix you up with 



108 



IF 




a back sling.” The big man did 
not look happy, and Dom thought 
he knew why. “And don’t worry 
about missing any of the fighting. 
There’ll be enough for everyone.” 
“I’m a combatman . 

“We’re all combatmen. All work- 
ing for one thing — to deliver the 
bombs. That’s your job now.” 
Helmutz did not act convinced 
and stood with stolid immobility 
while they rigged the harness and 
bomb onto the back of his suit. Be- 
fore they were finished, their head- 
phones crackled and a stir went 
through the company of suited men 
as a message came over the com- 
mand frequency. 

“Are you suited and armed? Are 
you ready for illumination adjust- 
ment?” 

“Combatmen suited and armed.” 
That was Sgt. Toth’s voice. 

“Bomb squad not ready,” Dom 
said, and they hiurried to niake the 
last fastenings aware that the rest 
were waiting for them. 

“Bomb squad suited and armed.” 
“Lights.” 

II 

'As the command rang out, the 
bulkhead lights faded out until 
the darkness was broken only by 
the dim red lights in the ceiling 
above. Until their eyes became ad- 
justed, it was almost impossible to 
see. Dom groped his way to one 
of the benches, found the oxygen 



hose with his fingers and plugged 
it into the side of his helmet; this 
would conserve his tank oxygen dur- 
ing the wait. Brisk music was being 
played over the command circuit 
now as part of morale sustaining. 
Here in the semidarkness, suited 
and armed, the waiting could soon 
become nerve-racking. Everything 
was done to alleviate the pressure. 
The music faded, and a voice re- 
placed it. 

“This is the executive officer 
speaking. I’m going to try and keep 
you in the picture as to what is 
happening up here. The Edinbur- 
gers are attacking in fleet strength 
and, soon after they were sighted, 
their ambassador declared that a 
state of war exists. He asks that 
Earth surrender at once or risk the 
consequences. Well, you all know 
what the answer to that one was. 
The Edinburgers have invaded and 
conquered twelve settled planets al- 
ready and incorporated them into 
their Greater Celtic Co-prosperity 
Sphere. Now they’re getting greedy 
and going for the big one — Earth 
itself, the planet their ancestors left 
a hundred generations ago. In do- 
ing this . Just a moment, I have 
a battle report here . first con- 
tact with our scouts.” 

Tlie officer stopped for a mo- 
ment, then his voice picked up 
again. 

“Fleet strength, but no larger 
than we expected and we will be 
able to handle them. But there is 



OR BATTLE'S SOUND 



109 




one difference in their tactics, and 
the combat computer is analyzing 
this now. They were the ones who 
originated the MT invasion techni- 
que, landing a number of cargo 
craft on a planet, all of them loaded 
with matter-transmitter screens. As 
you know, the invading forces at- 
tack through these screens direct 
from their planet to the one that 
is to be conquered. Well, they’ve 
changed their technique now. This 
entire fleet is protecting a single 
ship, a Kriger-dass scout carrier. 
What this means . Hold on, 
here is the readout from the com- 
bat computer. Only possibility sin- 
gle ship landing area increase MT 
screen -breakthrough, that’s what it 
says. Which means that there is a 
good chance that this ship may be 
packing a single large MT screen, 
bigger than anything ever built be- 
fore. If this is so — and they get 
the thing down to the surface — 
they can fly heavy bombers right 
through it, fire pre-aimed ICBM’s, 
send through troop carriers, any- 
thing. If this happens the invasion 
will be successful.” 

A round him, in the red-lit dark- 
ness, Dom was aware of the 
other suited figures who stirred 
silently as they heard the words. 

^7/ this happens.” There was a 
ring of authority now in the exec- 
utive officer’s voice. ”The Edin- 
burgers have developed the only 
way to launch an interplanetary in- 



vasion. We have found the way to 
stop it. You combatmen are the 
answer. They have now put all their 
eggs in one basket — and you are 
going to take that basket to pieces. 
You can get through where attack 
ships or missiles could not. We’re 
closing fast now, and you will be 
called to combat stations soon. So — 
go out there and do your job. The 
fate of Earth rides with you.” 
Melodramatic words, Dom 
thought, yet they were true. 
Everything, the ships, the concen- 
tration of fire power, all depended 
on them. The alert alarm cut 
through his thoughts, and he 
snapped to attention. 

“Disconnect oxygen. Fall out 
when your name is called and pro- 
ceed to the firing room in the order 
called. Toth . .” 

The names were spoken quickly, 
and the combatmen moved out. At 
the entrance to the firing room a 
suited man with a red-globed light 
checked the name on their chests 
against his roster to make sure they 
were in the correct order. Every- 
thing moved smoothly, easily, just 
like a drill, because the endless 
drills had been designed to train 
them for just this moment. The fir- 
ing room was familiar, though they 
had never been there before, be- 
cause their trainer had been an ex- 
act duplicate of it. The combatman 
ahead of Dom went to port, so he 
moved to starboard. The man pre- 
ceding him was just climbing into a 



110 



IF 




capstde, and Dom waited while the 
armorer helped him down into it 
and adjusted the armpit supports. 
Then it was his turn, and Dom 
slipped into the transparent plastic 
sheU and settled against the seat 
as he seized the handgrips. The 
armorer pulled the supports hard up 
into his armpits, and he nodded 
when they seated right. A moment 
later, the man was gone, and he 
was alone in the semi-darkness with 
the dim red glow shining on the 
top ring of the capsule that was 
just above his head. There was a 
sudden shudder, and he gripped 
hard, just as the capsule started 
forward 

As it moved, it tilted back- 
wards until he was lying on his 
back, looking up through the metal 
rings that banded his plastic shell. 
His capsule was moved sideways, 
jerked to a stop, then moved again. 
Now the gun was visible, a half 
dozen capsules ahead of his, and 
he thought, as he always did dxnring 
training, how like an ancient quick- 
firing cannon the gun was — a 
cannon that fired human beings. 
Every two seconds, the charging 
mechanism seized a capsule from 
one of the alternate feed belts, 
whipped it to the rear of the gun 
where it instantly vanished into the 
breech. Then another and another. 
The one ahead of Dom disappeared 
and he braced himself — and the 
mechanism suddenly and for no ap- 
parent reason halted. 



'T^here was a flicker of fear that 
something had gone wrong with 
the complex gun, before he re- 
alized that all of the first combat- 
men had been launched and that 
the computer was waiting a deter- 
mined period of time for them to 
prepare the way for the bomb 
squad. His squad now, the men he 
would lead. 

Waiting was harder than moving 
as he looked at the black mouth 
of the breech. The computer would 
be ticking away the seconds now, 
while at the same time tracking the 
target and keeping the ship aimed 
to the correct trajectory. Once he 
was in the gun, the magnetic field 
would seize the rings that banded 
his capsule, and the linear accelera- 
tor of the gun would draw him 
up the evacuated tube that pene- 
trated the entire length of the great 
ship from stern to bow. Faster and 
faster the magnetic fields would 
pull him until he left the mouth of 
the gun at the correct speed and 
on the correct trajectory to ... 

His capsule was whipped up in a 
tight arc and shoved into the dark- 
ness. Even as he gripped tight on 
the handholds, the pressure pads 
came up and hit him. He could not 
measure the time — he could not 
see and he could not breathe as the 
brutal acceleration pressed down on 
him. Hard, harder than anything he 
had ever experienced in training; he 
bad that one thought, and then he 
was out of the gun. 



OR BATTLE'S SOUND 



111 




In a single instant he went from 
acceleration to weightlessness, and 
he gripped hard so he would not 
float away from the capside. There 
was a puff of vapor from the un- 
heard explosions; he felt them 
through his feet, and the metal 
rings were blown in half, and the 
upper portion of the capsule shat- 
tered and hurled away. Now he was 
alone, weightless, holding to the 
grips that were fastened to the 
rocket unit beneath his feet. He 
looked about for the space battle 
that he knew was in progress and 
felt a slight disappointment that 
there was so little to see. 

Something burned far off to his 
right, and there was a wavering in 
the brilliant points of the stars as 
some dark object occulted them 
and passed on. This was a battle 
of computers and instruments at 
great (Ustances. There was very 
little for the unaided eye to see. 
The spaceships were black and 
swift and — for the most part — 
thousands of miles away. They 
were firing homing rockets and 
proximity shells, also just as swift 
and invisible. He knew that space 
around him was filled with signal 
jammers and false signal genera- 
tors, but none of this was visible. 
Even the target vessel towards 
which he was rushing was invisi- 
ble. 

For all that his limited senses 
could tell, he was alone in space, 
motionless, forgotten. 



Oomething shuddered against the 
^ soles of his boots, and a jet of 
vapor shot out and vanished from 
the rocket imit. No, he was 
neither motionless nor forgotten. 
The combat computer was still 
tracking the target ship and had 
detected some minute variation 
from its predicted path. At the 
same time, the computer was fol- 
lowing the progress of his trajec- 
tory, and it made the slight cor- 
rection for this new data. Cor- 
rections must be going out at the 
same time to all the other corn- 
batmen in space, before and be- 
hind him. They were small and 
invisible — doubly invisible now 
that the metal rings had been 
shed. There was no more than an 
eighth of a pound of metal dis- 
persed through the plastics and 
ceramics of a combatman’s equip- 
ment. Radar coidd never pick 
them out from among all the in- 
terference. They should get 
through. 

Jets blasted again, and Dom 
saw that the stars were turning 
above his head. Touchdown soon; 
the tiny radar in his rocket unit 
had detected a mass @b^d and 
had directed that He Bg turned 
end for end. Once this was done 
he knew that the combat compu- 
ter would cut free and turn con- 
trol over to the tiny set-down com- 
puter that was part of his radar. 
His rockets blasted, strong now, 
punching the supports up against

him, and he looked down pas£ his 
feet at the growing dark shage 
that occulted the stars. 

With a roar, loud in the silence, 
his headphones burst into life. 

‘Went, went — gone hungry. 
Went, went — gone hungry.” 

The silence grew again, but in 
it Dom no longer felt alone. The 
brief message had told him a lot. 

Firstly, it was Sergeant Toth’s 
voice; there was no mistaking that. 
Secondly, the mere act of breaking 
radio silence showed that they had 
engaged the enemy and that their 
presence was known. The code 
was a simple one that would be 
meaningless to anyone outside 
their company. Translated, it 
said that fighting was still going 
on but the advance squads were 
holding their own. They had cap- 
tured the center section of the 
hull — always the best place to 
rendezvous since it was impossible 
to tell bow from stern in the dark- 
ness ^ — and were holding it, await- 
ing the arrival of the bomb squad. 
The retrorockets flared hard and 
long, and the rocket unit crashed 
sharply into the black bull. Dom 
jumped free and rolled. 

Ill 

A s he came out of the roll, he 
saw a suited figure looming 
above him, clearly outlined by the 
disk of the sim despite his black 
nonreflective armor. The top of 



the helmet was smooth. Even as 
hei realized this, Dom was pulling 
the gropener from its holster. 

A doud of vapor sprang out, 
and the man vanished behind it. 
Dom was surprised, but he did not 
hesitate. Handguns, even recoilless 
ones like this that sent the burnt 
gas out to the sides, were a haz- 
ard in no-G space combat. Guns 
were not only difficult to aim but 
either had a recoil that would 
throw the user back out of po- 
sition or the gas had to be vented 
sideways, when they would blind 
the user for vital moments. A 
fraction of a second was all a 
trained combatman needed. 

As the gropener swung free, 
Dom thumbed the jet button 
lightly. The device was shaped 
like a short sword, but it had a 
vibrating saw blade where one 
sharpened edge should be, with 
small jets mounted opposite it in 
place of the other edge. The jets 
drove the device forward, pulling 
him after it. As soon as it touched 
the other man’s leg, he pushed the 
jets full on. As the vibrating cera- 
mic blade speeded up, the force 
of the jets pressed it into the thin 
armor. 

In less than a second, it had 
cut its way through and on into 
the flesh of the leg inside. Dom 
pressed the reverse jet to pull 
away as vapor gushed out, con- 
densing to ice particles instantly, 
and his opponent writhed, clutch-

ed at his thigh — then went sud- 
denly limp. 

Dom^s feet touched the hull, 
and the soles adhered. Ho realized 
that the entire action had taken 
place in the time it took him to 
straighten out from his roll and 
stand up . 

Don^t think, act. Training. As 
soon as his feet adhered, he 
crouched and turned, looking 
about him. A heavy power ax 
sliced by just above his head, tow- 
ing its wielder after it. 

Act, don’t think. His new 
ent was on his left side, away frmn 
the gropener, and was already re- 
versing the direction of his ax. A 
man has two hands. The drillger 
on his left thigh! Even as he re- 
membered it, he had it in his 
hand, driH on and hilt-jet flaring. 
The foot-long, diamond^ard drill 
spun fiercdy — its rotation can- 
cefled by the counter-revolving 
wei^t in the h3t — while the jet 
drove it forward. 

It went into the Edinburger’s 
midriff, scarcely idowing as it fore 
a hole in the armor and plun^ 
inside. As his opponent folded, 
Dorn thtunbed the reverse jet to 
pu^ the drillger out. The power 
ax, stni with momentum from the 
last blast of its jet, tore free of 
the dying man’s hand and vanish- 
ed into space. 

'^here were no other enemies in 
^ sight. Dom tilted forward on 



one toe so that the siuface film on 
the boot sole was switched from 
adhesive to neutral, then he step- 
ped forward slowly. Walking like 
this took practice, but he had had 
that. Abe^ was a group of dark 
figures lying prone on the hull, 
and he tock the precaution *of rais- 
ing his haiKl to touch the horn on 
the top of his helmet so there 
would be no mistakes. This iden- 
tification had been agreed upon 
just a few days ago and the i^astic 
spikes glued on. The Edinburgers 
all had smooth-topped helmets. 

Dom dived forward between the 
scattered forms and did, face 
down. Before his body could re- 
bound from the hull, he switched 
on his belly-sticker, and the sur- 
face film there held him flat. Se- 
cure for the moment among his 
own men, he thumbed the side of 
his helmet to change frequencies. 
There was now a jumble of noise 
through most of the frequencies, 
messages — both theirs and the 
enemy’s — jamming, the false mes- 
sages being broadcast by recorder 
units to cover the real exchange 
of information. There was scaredy 
any traffic on the bombHsquad fre- 
quwey, and he waited for a dear 
spot. His men would have heard 
Toth’s message, so they knew where 
to gather. Now he could bring them 
to him. 

''Quasar, quasar, quasar,” he 
called, then coimted carefnBy for 
ten seconds before he switdi^ on

IF 




the blue bulb on his shoulder. He 
stood as he did this, let it burn for 
a single second, then dropped back 
to the hull before he could draw 
any fire. His men would be look- 
ing for the light and would assem- 
ble on it. One by one they began 
to crawl out of the darkness. He 
counted them as they appeared. A 
combatman, without the bulge of 
a bomb on his back, ran up and 
dived and slid, so that his helmet 
touched Dorn’s. 

'^How many. Corporal?” Toth’s 
voice asked. 

”One still missing but ...” 

'^No buts. We move now. Set 
your charge and blow as soon as 
you have cover.” 

He was gone before Dom could 
answer. But he was right. They 
could not afford to wait for one 
man and risk the entire operation. 
Unless they moved soon, they 
would be trapped and killed up 
here. Individual combats were still 
going on about the hull, but it 
would not be long before the Edin- 
burgers realized these were just 
holding actions and that the main 
force of attackers was gathered in 
strength. The bomb squad went 
swiftly and skillfully to work lay- 
ing the ring of shaped charges. 

^^he rear guards must have been 
called in, because the heavy 
weapons opened fire suddenly on 
all sides. These were ".30 cdibre 
high-velocity recoilless machine 



guns. Before firing, the gunners had 
traversed the hull, aiming for a 
grazing fire that was as close to 
the surface as possible. The gun 
computer remembered this and now 
fired along the selected pattern, aim- 
ing automatically. This was need- 
ed because, as soon as the firing 
began, clouds of gas jetted out, 
obscuring everything. Sgt. Toth 
appeared out of the smoke and 
shouted as his helmet touched 
Dorn’s. 

^'Haven’t you blown it yet?” 
''Ready now, get back.” 

"Make it fast. They’re all down 
or dead now out there. But they 
will throw something heavy into 
this smoke soon, now that they 
have us pinpointed.” 

The bomb squad drew back, 
fell flat, and Dom pressed the ig- 
niter, Flames and gas exploded 
high, while the hull hammered up 
at them. Through the smoke rush- 
ed up a solid column of air, cloud- 
ing and freezing into tiny crystals 
as it hit the vacuum. The ship was 
breeched now, and they would keep 
it that way, blowing open the seal- 
ed compartments and bulkheads to 
let out the atmosphere. Dom and 
the Sergeant wriggled through the 
smoke together, to the edge of the 
wide, gaping hole that had been 
blasted in the ship’s skin. 

"Hotside, hotside!” the Ser- 
geant shouted, and dived through 
the opening. 

Dom pushed away through the 



OR BATTLE'S SOUND 



117 




rush of men who were foHowing 
the Sergeant and assembed his 
squad. He was still one man short. 
A weapons man with his machine 
gun on his back hurried by and 
leapt into the hole, with his am- 
munition carriers right behind him. 
The smoke cloud was growing be- 
cause some of the guns were still 
firing, acting as a rear guard. It was 
getting hard to see the opening 
now. When Dom had estimated 
that half the men had gone 
through, he led his own squad 
forward. 

They pushed down into a dark- 
ened compartment, a storeroom of 
some kind, and saw a combatman 
at a hole about 100 yards from 
here,’’ he said as soon as Dorn’s 
helmet touched his. ”We tried to 
the right first but there’s too much 
resistance. Just holding them 
there.” 

D om led his men in a floating 
run, the fastest movement 
possible in a nuU-G situation. The 
corridor was empty for the mo- 
ment, dimly lit by the emrgency 
bulbs. Holes hack been blasted in 
the walls at regular intervals, to 
open the sealed compartments and 
empty them of air, as well as to 
destroy wiring and piping. As they 
passed one of the ragged-edged 
openings, spacesuited men erupted 
from it. 

Bom dived under the thrust of 
a drillger, swinging his gropener 



out at the same time. It caught 
his attacker in the midriff, just as 
the man’s other hand came up. The 
Edinburger folded and died, and a 
sharp pain lanced throu^ Dorn’s 
leg. He looked down at the nipoff 
that was fastened to his calf and 
was slowly severing it. 

The nipoff was an outmoded de- 
sign for use against unarmored 
suits. It was killing him. The two 
curved blades were locked around 
his leg, and the tiny, geared-down 
motor was slowly closing them. 
Once started, the device could not 
be stopped. 

It could be destroyed. Even as 
he realized this, he swung down his 
gropener and jammed it against 
the nipoff’s handle. The pain in- 
tensified at the sideways pressure, 
and he almost blacked out. He at- 
tempted to ignore it. Vapor puffed 
out around the blades, and he trig- 
gered the compression ring on his 
thigh that sealed the leg from the 
rest of the suit. Then the gropener 
cut through the casing. There was 
a burst of sparks, and the motion 
of the closing of the blades stop- 
ped. 

When Dom looked up, the brief 
battle was over and the counterat- 
tackers were dead. The rear guard 
had caught up and pushed over 
them. Helmutz must have account- 
ed for more than one of them him- 
self. He held his power ax high, 
fingers just touching the buttons 
in the haft so that the jets above

the blade spurted alternately to 
swing the ax to and fro. There was 
blood on both blades. 

IV 

D om switched on his radio; it 
was silent on all bands. The 
interior communication circuits of 
the ship were knocked out here, and 
the metal walls damped all radio 
signals. 

''Report,” he said. "How many 
did we lose?” 

"You’re hurt,” Wing said bend- 
ing over him. "Want me to pull 
that thing off?” 

"Leave it. The tips of the blades 
are almost touching, and you’d tear 
half my leg off. It’s frozen in with 
the blood, and I can still get around. 
Lift me up.” 

The leg was getting numb now, 
with the blood supply cut off and 
the air replaced by vacuum. That 
was all for the best. He took the 
roll count. 

"We’ve lost two men but we 
still have more than enough bombs 
for this job. Now let’s move.” 
Sgt. Toth himself was waiting at 
the next corridor, where another 
hole had been blasted in the deck. 
He looked at Dorn’s leg but said 
nothing. 

"How is it going?” Dom asked. 
"Fair. We took some losses. We 
gave, them more. Engineer says we 
are over the main hold now, so we 
are going straight down, pushing 



out men on each level to hold. Get 
going.” 

"And you?” 

"I’ll bring down the rear guard 
and pull the men from each level as 
we pass. You see that you have 
a way out for us when we all get 
down to you.” 

"You can count on that.” 

Dom floated out over the hole, 
then gave a strong kick with his 
good leg against the ceiling when 
he was lined up. He went down 
smoothly, and his squad followed. 
They passed one deck, two, then 
three. The openings had been nicely 
aligned for a straight drop. There 
was a flare of light and a burst of 
smoke ahead as another deck was 
blown through. Helmutz passed 
Dom, going faster, having pushed 
off harder with both legs. He was 
a full deck ahead when he plunged 
through the next opening, and the 
burst of high velocity machine gun 
fire almost cut him in two. He 
folded in the middle, dead in the 
instant, the impact of the bullets 
driving him sideways and out of 
sight in the deck below. 

Dom thumbed the jets on the 
gropener, and it pulled him aside 
before he followed the combatman. 

"Bomb squad, disperse,” he or- 
dered. "Troops coming through.” 
He switched to the combat fre- 
quency and looked up at the rag- 
ged column of men dropping down 
towards him. 

"The deck below had been retak- 

119 



OR BATTLFS SOUND 




en. I am at the last occupied deck.” 
He waved his hand to indicate 
wh« was talking, and the stream 
of men began to jet their weapons 
and move on by him. They’re be- 
low me. The bullets came from 
this side.” The combatman pushed 
on without a word. 

'^he metal flooring shook as an- 
other opening was blasted 
somewhere behind him. The con- 
tinuous string of men moved by. 
A few seconds later a helmeted fig- 
ure — with a horned helmet — ap- 
peared below and waved the all- 
clear. The drop continued. 

On the bottom deck, the men 
were all jammed almost shoulder 
to shoulder, and more were arriving 
all the time. 

''Bomb squad here, give me a re- 
port,” Dom radioed. A combatman 
vrith a napboard slung at his waist 
pushed back out of the crowd. 

"We reached the cargo hold — 
it’s immense — but we’re being 
pushed back. Just by weight of 
numbers. The Edinburgers are des- 
perate. They are putting men 
through the MT screen in light 
pressure suits. Unarmored, almost 
imarmed. We kill them easily 
enough but they have pushed us 
out bodily. They’re coming right 
from the invasion planet. Even 
when we kill them, the bodies 
block the way ...” 

"You the engineer?” 

"Yes.” 



"Whereabouts in the hold is the 
MT screen?” 

"It runs the length of the hold 
and is back against the far wall.” 
'^Controls?” 

"On the left side.” 

"Can you lead us over or 
around the hold so we can break 
in near the screen?” 

The engineer took a single look 
at charts. 

"Yes, around. Through the en- 
gine room. We can blast through 
close to the controls.” 

"Let’s go then.” Dom switched 
to combat frequency and waved his 
arm over his head. "All combatmen 
who can see me — this way. We’re 
going to make a flank attack.” 

They moved down the long cor- 
ridor as fast as they could, with 
the combatmen ranging out ahead 
of the bomb squad. There were 
sealed pressure doors at regular 
intervals, but these were b3q>assed 
by blasting through the billheads 
at the side. There was resistance and 
there were more dead as they ad- 
vanced — from both sides. Then 
a group of men gathered ahead, 
and Dom floated up to the greatly 
depleted force of combatmen who 
had forced their way this far. A 
corporal touched his helmet to 
Dorn’s pointing to a great sealed 
door at the corridor’s end. 

"The engine room is behind 
there. These walls are thick. Ev- 
eryone off to one side, because 
we must use an octupled charge.” 



120 



IF 




They dispersed, and the bulk- 
heads heaved and buckled when the 
charge exploded. Dom, looking to- 
wards the corridor, saw a sheet of 
flame sear by, followed by a col- 
unm of air that turned instantly to 
sparkling granules of ice. The en- 
gineroom had still been pressurized. 

^^here had been no warning, and 
^ most of the crewmen had not 
had their helmets sealed. They 
were violently and suddenly dead. 
The few survivors were killed 
quickly when they offered resist- 
ance with improvised weapons. 
Dom scarcely noticed this as he 
led his bomb squad after the en- 
gineer. 

^^That doorway is not on my 
charts,” the engineer said, angri- 
ly, as though the spy who had 
stolen the information was at 
fault. ^^It must have been added 
after construction.” 

''Where does it go to?” Dom 
asked. 

"The MT hold, no other place 
is possible.” 

Dom thought quickly. "I’m go- 
ing to try and get to the MT con- 
trols without fighting. I need a 
volunteer to go with me. If we re- 
move identification and wear 
Edinburger equipment we should 
be able to do it.” 

"I’ll join you,” the engineer said. 

"No, you have a different job. I 
want a good combatman.” 

"Me,” a man said, pushing 



through the others. "Pimenov, best 
in my squad. Ask anybody.” 

"Let’s make this fast.” 

The disguise was simple. With 
the identifying spike knocked off 
their helmets and enemy equipment 
slung about them, they would 
pass any casual examination. A 
A handful of grease obscured the 
names on their chests. 

"Stay close behind and come 
fast when I knock the screen out,” 
Dom told the others, then led the 
combatman' through the door. 

There was a narrow passageway 
between large tanks and another 
door at the far end. It was made 
of light metal but was blocked by 
a press of human bodies, spacesuit- 
ed men who stirred and struggled 
but scarcely moved. The two corn- 
batmen pushed harder, and a sud- 
den movement of the mob re^ 
leased the pressure; Dom fell for- 
ward, his helmet banging into that 
of the nearest man. 

"What the devil you about?” 
the man said, twisting his head to 
look at Dom. 

"More of them down there,’^ 
Dom said, trying to roll his R’s 
the way the Edinburgers did. 

"You’re no one of us I” the man 
said and struggled to bring his 
weapon up. 

Dom could not risk a fight here 
— ^yet the man had to be silenced. 
He was wearing a thin spacesuit. 
Dom could just reach the Ughtning 
prod, and he jerked it from its 



OR BATTLES SOUND 



121 




dip and jammed it against the 
Edinburger^s side. The pair of 
needle-sharp spikes pierced suit 
and dothes and bit into his flesh, 
and when the hilt slammed against 
his bodj^ the circuit was dosed. The 
handle of the lightning prod was 
filled with powerful capadtors that 
released their stored dectridty in 
a single immense charge through 
the needles. The Edinburger writh- 
ed and died instantly. 

They used his body to push a 
way into the crowd. 

Dom-had just enough sensation 
left in his injured leg to be aware 
when the damped-on nippoff was 
twisted in his flesh by the men 
about them; he kept Ids thoughts 
from what it was doing to his leg. 

V 

/^nce the Edinburger soldiers 
were aware of the open door, 
they pulled it wide and fought 
their way through it. The combat- 
men would be waiting for them in 
the engine room. The sudden exo- 
dus relieved the pressure of the 
bodies for a moment, and Dom, 
with Pimenov struggling after him, 
pushed and worked his way toward 
the MT controls. 

It was like trying to move in a 
dream. The dark hulk of the MT 
screen was no more than ten yards 
away, yet they cotddn’t seem to 
reach it. Soldiers sprang from the 
screen, pushing and crowding in. 



more and more, preventing any 
motion in that direction. The tech- 
nicians stood at the controls, their 
helmet phones plugged into the 
board before them. Without grav- 
ity to push against, jammed into 
the crowd that floated at all levels 
in a fierce tangle of arms and legs, 
movement was almost impossible. 
Pimenov touched his helmet to 
Dorn’s. 

'T’m going ahead to cut a path. 
Stay close behind me.” 

He broke contact before Dom 
could answer him and let his pow- 
er ax pull him forward into the 
press. Then he began to chop it 
back and forth in a short arc, al- 
most hacking his way through the 
packed bodies. Men turned on him, 
but he did not stop, lashing out 
with his gropener as they tried to 
fight. Dom followed. 

They were close to the MT con- 
trols before the combatman was 
buried under a crowd of stabbing, 
cursing Edinburgers. Pimenov had 
done his job, and he died doing it. 
Dom jetted his gropener and let 
it drag him forward until he slam- 
med into the thick steel frame of 
the MT screen above the operators’ 
heads. He slid the weapon along 
(the frame, dragging himself head- 
first through the press of suited 
bodies. There was a relatively 
clear space near the controls. He 
drifted down into it and let his 
drillger slide into the operator’s 
back. The man writhed and died 



122 



IF 




quickly. The other operator turned 
and took the weapon in his stom- 
ach. His face was just before Dom 
as his eyes widened and he scream- 
ed soundlessly with pain and fear. 
Dom could not escape the dead, 
horrified features as he struggled 
to drop the atomic bomb from his 
carrier. The murdered man stayed, 
pressed close against him all the 
the time. 

Now! 

TTe cradled the bomb against his 
i-*--** chest and, in a single swift 
motion, pulled out the arming pin, 
twisted the fuse to five seconds, 
and slammed down hard on the ac- 
tuator. Then he reached up and 
switched the MT from receive to 
send. 

The last soldiers erupted from 
the screen, and there was a grow- 
ing gap behind them. Into this 
space and through the screen Dom 
threw the bomb. 

After that, he kept the switch 
down and tried not to think about 
what was happening among the 
men of the invasion army who 
were waiting before the MT screen 
on that distant planet. 

Then he had to hold this po- 
sition until the combatmen arrived. 
He sheltered behind the opera- 
tor’s corpse and used his drillger 
against the few Edinburgers who 
were close enough to realize that 
something had gone wrong. This 
was easy enough to do because, al- 



though they were soldiers, they 
were men from the invasion reg- 
ular army and knew nothing about 
null-G combat. Very soon after 
this, there was a great stir, and 
the closest ones were thrust aside. 
An angry combatman blasted 
through, sweeping his power ax 
towards Dorn’s neck. Dom dodged 
the blow and switched his radio 
to combat frequency. 

'^Hold that! I’m Corporal Prie- 
go, bomb squad. Get in front of me 
and keep anyone else from mak- 
ing the same mistake.” 

The man was one of those who 
had taken the engine room. He 
recognized Dom now and nodded, 
turning his back to him and press- 
ing against him. More combatmen 
stormed up to form an iron shield 
around the controls. The engineer 
pushed through between them, and 
Dom helped him reset the fre- 
quency on the MT screen. 

After this, the battle became a 
slaughter and soon ended. 

''Sendout!” Dom radioed as 
soon as the setting was made, then 
turned the screen to transmit. He 
heard the words repeated over and 
over as the combatmen repeated 
the withdrawal signal so that ev- 
eryone could hear it. Safety lay on 
the other side of the screen, now 
that it was tuned to Tycho Bar- 
racks on the Moon. 

It was the Edinburgers, living, 
dead and wounded who were sent 
through first. They were pushed 



OR BATTLE'S SOUND 



123 




back against the screen to make 
room for the combatmen who were 
streaming into the hold. The ones 
at the ends of the screen simply 
bounced against the hard surface 
and recoiled; the receiving screen 
at Tycho was far smaller than this 
great invasion screen. They were 
pushed along until they fell 
through, and combatmen took up 
positions to mark the limits of op- 
erating screen. 

D om was aware of someone in 
front of him, and he had to 
blink away the red film that was 
trying to cover his eyes. 

Wing,” he said, finely recogniz- 
ing the man. ^'How many others 
of the bomb squad made it?” 
^^None I know of, Dom. Just 
me.” 

No, don’t think about the dead! 
Only the living counted now. 

^^All right. Leave your bomb 
here and get on through. One is 
all we really need.” He tripped 
the release and pulled the bomb 
from Wing’s rack before giving him 
a push towards the screen. 

Dom had the bomb clamped to 
the controls when Sergeant Toth 
slammed up beside him and touch- 
ed helmets. 

Almost done.” 

'^Done now,” . Dom setting the 
fuse and pulling out the arming 
pin. 

.''Then get moving. I’ll take it 
from here.” 



"No you don’t. My job.” He 
had to shake his head to make 
the haze go away but it still re- 
mained at the corners of his vision. 

Toth didn’t argue. "What’s the 
setting?” he asked. 

"Five and six. Five seconds after 
actuation the chemical bomb blows 
and knocks out the controls. One 
second later the atom bomb goes 
off.” 

"I’ll stay around I think to 
watch the fun.” 

Time was acting strangely for 
Dom, speeding up and slowing 
down. Men were hurrying by, into 
the screen, first in a rush, then 
fewer and fewer. Toth was talking 
on the combat frequency, but Dom 
had switched the radio off because 
it hurt his head. The great cham- 
ber was empty now of all but the 
dead, with the automatic machine 
guns left firing at the entrances. 
One of them blew up as Toth 
touched helmets. 

"They’re all through. Let’s go.” 

Dom had difficulty talking, so 
he nodded instead and hammered 
his fist down onto the actuator. 

Men were coming towards them, 
but Toth had his arms around 
him, and full jets on his power 
ax were sliding them along the sur- 
face of the screen. And through. 

When the brilliant lights of Ty- 
cho Barracks hit his eyes, Dom 
closed them, and this time the red 
haze came up, over him, all the 
way.

44TTow’s the new leg?” Sergeant 
Toth asked. He slumped 
lazily in the chair beside the hos- 
pital bed. 

''I can’t feel a thing. Nerve 
channels blocked until it grows 
tight to the stump.” Dom put aside 
the book he had been reading and 
wondered what Toth was doing 
here. 

come around to see the 
wounded,” the Sergeant said, an- 
swering the unasked question. 
^'Two more besides you. Captain 
told me to.” 

'^The Captain is as big a sadist 
as you are. Aren’t we sick enough 
already?” 

"Good joke.” His expression did 
not change. "I’ll tell the Captain. 
He’ll like it. You going to buy out 
now?” 

"Why not? Dom wondered why 
the question made him angry. "I’ve 
had a combat mission, the medals, 
a good wound. More than enough 
points to get my discharge.” 

"Stay in. You’re a good combat- 
man when you stop thinking about 
it. There’s not many of them. 
Make it a career.” 

"L&e you. Sergeant? Make kill- 
ing my life’s work? Thank you, no. 
I intend to do something different, 
a little more constructive. Unlike 
you, I don’t relish this whole dirty 
business, the killing, the outright 
plain murder. You like it.” This 
sudden thought sent him sitting 
upright in the bed. "Maybe that’s 



it. Wars, fighting, everything. It 
has nothing to do any more with 
territory rights or aggression or 
masculinity. I think that you peo- 
ple make wars because of the ex- 
citement of it, the thrill that noth- 
ing else can equal. You really like 
war.” 

Toth rose, stretched easily and 
turned to leave. He stopped at the 
door, frowning in thought. 

"Maybe you’re right, Corporal. 
I don’t think about it much. May- 
be I do like it.” His face lifted in 
a cold tight smile. "But don’t for- 
get — you like it too” 

Dom went back to his book, re- 
sentful of the intrusion. His liter- 
ature professor had sent it, along 
with a flattering note. He had 
heard about Dom on the broad- 
casts, and the entire school was 
proud, and so on. A book of poems 
by Milton, really good stuff. 

No waff or battles sound 
Was heard the world around. 

Yes, great stuff. But it hadn’t 
been true in Milton’s day and it 
ystill wasn’t true. ^Did mankind 
really like war? They must like it 
or it wouldn’t have lasted so long. 
This was an awful, criminal 
thought. 

He too? Nonsense. He fought 
well, but he had trained himself. 
It would not be true that he actu- 
ally liked all of that. 

Dom tried to read again, but the 
page kept blurring before his eyes.

After the first two alien contacts. 
Earth got used to alienation. The 
Biggies were cute, anyhow, and they 
brought the most ancient of gifts.

CCTJere we go again,” said 
* Harry’s voice in my ear. 

I discovered my wife had waked 
up first and was holding the office 
phone over my face. It was still 
dark. 

« — Down by the Lunar Alps. 
Photos just coming in.” 



“Not those Capellan witches 
again?” I groaned. 

“Smaller. Different emission fea- 
tures. Get down here, Max.” 

Tillie was already dressing. When 
we’d gone to bed two hours back, 
the ears of earth were following a 
moving source which kept disap- 
pearing behind Lima, and our moon- 
station near Mersenius was scram- 



126 





bling to set up a far-side relay. Now 
the alien had landed, a third of a 
great drcle from our station. 

The photo courier passed us at 
the office door. Mersenius had sent 
a camera-eye over the alien ship. 

‘Xooks as if they’re interested in 
those ore-piles the CapeUans left,” 
said George. ‘What’s that, a der- 
rick?” 

“Derrick my azimuth,” I grunted, 
rapidly opening and closing alter- 
nate eyes to catch small differences 
in consecutive negatives. That’s 
called flashing. Big photo-shops do 
it with a trunk-sized geewWzzus » 
that’s about half as efficient as the 
trained human eye. m 

“That’s them. It. He. He is mov - 1

stance . Bipedal? Maybe, ifP 
that’s a tail. Yes I He is moving his B

height of that ore-pile?” P ^ 

“Forty-one meters.” Little Mrs. W 
Peabody had joined us, alert and « I 
dedicated. 4 

“Tentative estimate, six meters ^ 

tall,” I concluded. “We’ll see what 
Langley says in the morning; 
they’ve got better comparators. And 
not huuman. Let me project this 
shadow — if it straightened up, it 
would look something like a small M 

T5rrannosaurus, wouldn’t you say?” 

The spy-eye gave us a close-up 
on its second pass, just before the ^ fl 
alien knocked it down. We saw a 
lizard-like creature, helmeted and 
harnessed with weird hardware, '' ^

wearing an unpleasant expression on 
its lipless face. And blue. 

‘‘Eighteen-foot blue space-going 
dinosaurs, that’s what’s up there,” 
said Harry. “At least two of them.” 

“Or praying mantises,” said 
George. 

“Maybe he’s a she,” said Tillie. 

“Quit dreaming, kid,” I told her. 
“The lulu is played only once in a 
lifetime.” 

By this time, the main photo- 
shop had confirmed my height 
guess and added that the two aliens 
had pulled the spy-eye in with some 
sort of beam and then apparently 
cut it open for a brief look before 
blowing the remains. 

Meanwhile the hot-lines of the 
world were steaming, and the United 
Powers halls were boiling with dele- 
gates trying to get a decision on 
what to tell Mersenius to do. So 
many electric razors were used in 
the UnPo lounge that they blew 
a fuse and killed our landUne for 
fifteen minutes. At 0800 EST the 
question became academic. The 
aliens took off on a fast-precessing 
orbit around Terra itself. 

So far they had been silent. Now 
they began to transmit, and George 
ascended to his idea of Heaven with 
an endless supply of alien gabble to 
chew on. 

TT^hat exactly is our shop? 
^ ^ Basically, an unimportant bit 
of C.I.A. that got left out in the 
big move to Langley. (I warned you 



this would be the inside story from 
the pick-and-shovel level; I couldn’t 
know less about what the President 
said to the Premier.) We’re official- 
ly listed as a communications and 
special support facility. Just a small 
crew of oddball linguists and blown 
operators put out to pasture. It was 
a nice restful life until we acciden- 
tally got into the first great alien 
contact flap three years back. The 
Capellans, you’ll recall. George 
came out of that as our official Ex- 
traterrestrial Language Specialist, 
which hasn’t done his small-man’s 
ego any good. I am optimistically 
regarded as having a flare for alien 
psychology — shows you what can 
happen to a fair photointerpreter. 
Tillie is a crack polyglot. Did you 
know you get clobbered for calling a 
polyglot a linguist? Anyway, she’s 
George’s aide. And my wife. Harry 
is our captive physicist-of-all-work 
since they decided we rated an 
R&D. And Mrs. Peabody got up- 
graded to Chief of Archives, but she 
still does my income-tax forms. 

After the Girls from Capella left 
hurriedly, we all expected to coast 
into distinguished retirement with 
no further calls on our peculiar tal- 
ents, if any. Now suddenly here 
was Another Alien merrily orbiting 
Terra, and our little shop was being 
pelted with data and demands for 
answers. 

“They appear to be sending some 
sort of standard contact broadcast,” 
George reported. “Three or four

phrases repeated, and switch to a 
different l^guage. At least twenty- 
eight so far. One of them resembles 
Capellan, but not enough to read.” 

“I think it’s like a high Capel- 
lan,” said Tillie. “You know, like 
Mandarin to Cantonese. The Capel- 
lans who came here must have 
spoken a dialect. I’m sure I heard 
a formal I and you and something 
about speak 

“Could it be Do you speak our 
language? Or Will you speak?” 

The United Powers were now in 
hot debate as to whether and what 
to r^ly to the alien. George could 
scarcely be prevented from trying 
to pull something through his 
friends at the Voice; he was sweat- 
ing for fear the Swedes or Chicoms 
would beat us to it. But we couldn’t 
get an okay. That was the time our 
Joint Chiefs were so cozy with the 
President — remember? — and I 
think there was a struggle to keep 
them from testing their new anti- 
orbital-missile missile on the aliens. 
It may have been the same else- 
where; the big nations had all been 
working up their space defense since 
the Capellan visit. 

The upshot was that nobody did 
anything before the alien abruptly 
stopped transmitting speech and 
went into repeated da-dits. That 
lasted an hour. Then two things 
happened right together. First, 
Harry got a signal from Defense 
R&D that one of their boys had 
identified a digital equation having 



to do with fissionable elements in 
the da-dits. Right after that was 
the word from a Soviet tracker that 
the alien had ejected an object 
which was now trailing their ship. 

We all ducked and held our 
breaths. 

The blip stayed in orbit. 

Just as we started breathing 
again, the alien poked out a laser 
finger and the trailing blip went up 
in the prettiest fusion flare you ever 
saw — a complex burst, like three 
shorts and a long. 

'^his is probably where you came 
in. With that flare overhead, 
the world media roared out of con- 
trol. “ALIENS BLAST EARTHl” 
“BLUE LIZARDS HURL BOMB 
FROM SKYl” The miMtary was al- 
ready loose, of course, and an as- 
sortment of mega-squibs were blast- 
ing up towards the alien ship. 

They never connected. The alien 
deftly distributed three more blips 
in a pattern around earth, about 
150,000 miles out, and took off in 
the direction of the Coal Sack. They 
had been in our system exactly 
thirteen hours, during which the 
united brains of earth had demon- 
strated all the initiative of a shock- 
ed opossum. 

“Call me anthropocentric, but 
they struck me as ugly customers,” 
I brooded later. 

“And very alien,” said Tillie. 

“You’re supposed to be able to 
identify, remember?”

She gave me the old sulky leer, 
^th the new magic ingredient. 

“Marriage has ruined you, kid 
. Hey, George! Did you hear 
that those bombs they left are cov- 
ered with writing? About a zillion 
different scripts, in a nice fluores- 
cent blue. It’s your life work, old 
brother.” 

“A Galactic Rosetta stone,” 
breathed George as he sat down. 
“Max, you’ve got to keep the mili- 
tary from destro 3 ung them. The 
photos are not adequate.” 

“Three time-bombs going past our 
ears on the hour, and you want to 
preserve them as a reference li- 
brary? What if they’re loaded with 
disease? Or mutation inducers? 
Stupid-making generators, so we 
won’t get into space? Have you 
heard the newscasts? George, sober 
up.” 

“They can’t,” he groaned. “It’s 
priceless! The key to the Galaxy!” 

As it turned out, they didn’t, at 
least not then. Somebody was either 
too scared, or too avid for alien 
technology. A US-Soviet astroteam 
managed to make a remote-control 
dock with one of the ten-foot mis- 
siles and spent a week gingerly 
coaxing it around to a crater on the 
far side of Luna. From that minute, 
George lived to get to the moon. 
To my amazement, he screamed the 
medicos into an acceleration and 
low-G clearance, and next thing we 
knew he was actually booked for 
the Mersenius shuttle trip. In spite 



of looking like a dissipated mouse, 
George was fundamentally pretty 
healthy. 

At the good-bye party he told me 
he felt sure he had detected Capel- 
lan script on the missile’s fin. 

“Same as the verbal transmission 
— something about / you speakJ* 

“How about: If you can read this 
youWe too damn close? Good luck.” 

II 

Qo that was how we came to be 
short of George when Alien No. 
2 came along. (Or No. 3, if you 
count from the Capellans.) You 
know most of the story here. The 
new boys followed the same routine 
as the lizards: A couple of passes 
over Luna, pause to inspect the ore- 
piles, and then into orbit and start 
to transmit. There was a diversion 
when they spotted the two flying 
bombs. They quit transmitting and, 
while the world watched, they 
sneaked up behind one of the blips. 
There was no laser probe. Instead, 
we saw some sort of fog drift out 
of the newcomer’s ship and en- 
velope the blip. 

“They’ve melted it!” Harry yell- 
ed on the intercom. When the fog 
moved on, we could all see the blip 
was gone. The aliens were heading 
for the other. 

“NEW ALIENS CLEAR 
BOMBS FROM SKY!” “MEN- 
ACE FROM SPACE DESTROY- 
ED!” Remember?

With the second bomb gone> our

“What’ll I do, Max?. George won’t 
acknowledge his orders to returnl” 

“You can do it, girL What’s so 
hard about little stick figures? Read 
it like a comic strip.” 

“Did you ever try saying Who 
are you?, or Where do you come 
from? in little stick figures?” she 
asked bitterly. 

But they did look humanoid and 
peaceful enough. One sketch they 
kept repeating showed a mixture of 
big and little figures dandng mound 
a maypole affair. 

“The little figures seem to be 
them, and the big ones are us,” said 
Tillie. 

“You hope. And this one means 
they want to land, right?” 

You’ll recall we let them come 
down in a burnt-over wilderness 
area in Northern Quebec. No aloha- 
parties like we gave the Girls from 
Capella. No official grandstand. Just 
an empty plain, a sky full of con- 
trails, and five different brands of 
overkill zeroed in on that big golden 
ship as it settled. 

The air-lock opened. 

Everyone remembers what march- 
ed out into that empty plain — a 
band of little figures about four 
feet high and the color of the More 
Expensive Spread. They seemed to 
be wearing jointed golden armor 
with fxmny fittle half-opened hel- 
mets on their heads. They were 



carrying what looked like cereal- 
box death-ray guns. Each one held 
his up and then gravely trooped 
over and dropped his weapon on a 
pile. Then they joined hands and 
began to sing. 

This was the world’s first taste of 
what came to be known as the 
Soimd from Qygnus. It wasn’t real- 
ly too different from a musical saw 
to me, but you know how it caught 
on. Oh my earmuffs, did it catch 
onl That’s right, you had teen- 
aged kids. The thing hadn’t been 
zingling through our office a min- 
ute before I saw La Peabody start- 
ing to twitch. 

TT^hile we absorbed the Sound, 
▼ » a second band of little butter- 
boys marched out of the ship carry- 
ing a globe on a pole. The distant 
trigger-fingers ti^tened. But all 
they did was to set it up in the 
center, like the maypole in their 
sketches, and sing harder. Then they 
shutup, bowed deeply and just 
stood there. Waiting for someone 
to say Hello. 

It wasn’t long before a recep- 
tion committee crawled out of the 
bunkers and the second alien con- 
tact got underway. 

Quite a relief after the previous 
hoopla. This one went more like 
grown up. No sex. No nuclear fire- 
works. Just a mob of decorous 
little yellow squirts earnestly inter- 
ested in learning our languages and 
customs. Their chief concern seem- 



PUPA KNOWS BEST 



131 





ed U be to avoid getting poisoned 
by ®ur food. Did you know they 
were vegetarians? They answered 
everything we asked as well as they 
could. Their home system was 
quickly identified as Cygmis 61. 
The death-ray pistols were lasers; 
they passed out samples. They made 
no more objection to electronic 
surveillance than a herd of Guern- 
seysj and they let us into the ship 
with anything we wanted to bring. 
Harry was in on that. 

*‘Same general thing as the Ca- 
pdlans,” he reported. “And fairly 
old. T^y seem to have bought it 
second-hand from somewhere. Two 
auxiliary flyers on board. No ma- 
jor weapons we can find aside from 
small small standard missiles and

that particle-fog thing. That looks 
to be a catalyst effect.” 

“What makes you think they 
didn^t build it?” 

“Every time we ask a technical 
question they drag out a manual to 
look up the answer. They ended by 
giving us the whole set to copy. I 
brought back the lot. Where’s 
George?” 

“He won’t answer. What’s one 
language when he has hundreds? 
He’s up there with his Rosetta 
stone, and I doubt he’ll budge till 
his oxygen runs out.” 

“Fimny thing,” Harry mused. 
“They have this maypole thing all 
over the ship, in different sizes. One 
big room looks exactly like a chapel. 
I believe they’re deeply religious.” 

IF 



Just in time, 1 recalled that 
Harry himself was deeply reli^ous. 

And of course, that was the big 
news about our visitors. Until the 
religious angle came out, the Big- 
gies threatened to be about as news- 
worthy as an agronomists’ conven- 
tion. When the official tours got 
started it was quickly realized that 
the Sound was hymns. You remem- 
ber the pictiures — drcles of little 
yellow fellows setting up their may- 
poles at dawn, noon and sunset, 
wherever they happened to be, join- 
ing hands and singing and beckon- 
ing the bystanders to join in. With 
that Sound and their appealing 
appearance, they got a lot of takers, 
especially with the young people. 
TUs seemed to delight them. “You 
comp? You comp?” they would call. 
“Goodl You glike? Good?” they 
would ask, peering up into the hu- 
man faces around them when the 
song was over. When people' smiled 
back, the Biggies woidd grab their 
hands and squeeze. Their hands 
were cool and felt fragile. “Like a 
child’s hands in paper gloves,” one 
woman said. 

C(T do think they’re sweet,” Mrs. 

Peabody confessed. “Those 
little brown button eyes peering 
out.” 

“Reminds me of Hobbits,” said 
Tillie. “Meriadoc in armor.” 

“It’s not armor, it’s an exoskele- 
lon,” I told her. “It doesn’t come 
off.” 



“I know — but listen, they’re go- 
ing to sing.” 

By now, we knew that the ob- 
ject on top of the poles was not a 
globe. It was roughly egg-^aped, 
with interior aeases. 

“Like a bagel,” said Mrs. Pea- 
body. 

“They call it something like the 
Pupa, or the Great Pupa,” ssdd Til- 
lie. “It represents a C^gnian wrap- 
ped up like a cocoon. See the face?” 

“Looks sad,” said Harry. 

There was a note of sadness in 
the songs, too, sadness and exal- 
tation, which added immensdy to 
the appeal. The recording compan- 
ies knew a good thing when it fell 
on their heads, and the Sound rapid- 
ly became a menace on the radio 
bands. Rapa had three kids and 
told me he had smashed his set to 
stay sane. Well, you know all about 
this, those first weeks with the 
Biggies touring around and an^g 
in front of chturches and mosques 
and temples, and the Unitarian 
minister coming out to hold joint 
services in the open air, and the 
kids wearing maypole buttons and 
Great Pupa buttons and all the rest. 
Hands Across the Galaxy. Oekou- 
menel What you still don’t know 
about is S’serrrop. (We spelled it 
that way to indicate a hard buz- 
zing r-r-r. The Cygnians were 
strong on stops and clicks, but had 
trouble with our nasals and semi- 
vowels — I quote from Tillie.) 

S’serrrop came to us when the 



PUPA KNOWS BEST 



133 




West Hemisphere Cygnian party 
first went through D.C. We met 
him at the official mass reception 
— an indefinably tatty-looking Cyg- 
nian, somewhat pale in color. He 
was one of their many language 
students, and he and Tillie went 
fnt# a fast huddle. We had our 
chief ask for him to stay behind 
when the tour moved on; and for 
a wander we got him, after State 
had been practically in bed with 
the party for a week. The Siggies 
jumped at any chance to learn our 
languages. I guess they were sur- 
prised at the number. 

The thing about S^serrop was that 
he was different. A marginal 
Cygnian, if you like. We never 
found out why. How could you 
evaluate aberrant factors in an 
arthropod’s childhood? Anyway, he 
gave us some new insights. The first 
was about Siggie emotion. 

Remember how they always look- 
fed so sort of neat and merry? Well, 
S’serrrop disabused us of that the 
[day he tried to join us eating meat. 
He was yellower than usual when 
George was ordering the usual salad 
for him at Rapa’s. 

'^Gnol” clicked S’serrrop. 'T eat 
samp as hewl” 

IBs yellow color grew richer while 
he rejected our protests. When the 
meatballs arrived, we saw the crisis. 
You know that crest of tiddly bits 
sticking out above the Cygnian vi- 
sor was actually their chemorecep- 
tors and part of their ears? At 



sight of the meat, S’serrrop’s recep- 
tors began to retreat until his “hel- 
met” was a smooth round ^ere. 
He took a mouthful, chomped once, 
and looked wildly about. The ges- 
ture was so human 1 was on my 
feet ready to help our visitor from 
space to Rapa’s can. But he had 
swallpwed and sat there breathing 
hard; Stern stuff, S’serrrop. Tillie 
snatched up his plate and substi- 
tuted greens, and after awhile his 
crest came back out. 

T hat gave us the clue. There was 
a Siggie song-fest near the Mor- 
mon Temple in Salt Lake City on 
the screen that night. 

“Maxi” Tillie gasped, “Look at 
their heads I” 

Every one of them was as bare 
and round as a billiard-ball. And 
they were glowing like hot butter. 

“Intense fear, disgust, revulsion 
. Funny emotions for a quiet 
party of space-going sociologists.” 
“I’ll ask S’serrrop.” 

“Very carefully. Very, very care- 
fully.” 

Oddly enough, it was Harry who 
did the job. We discovered he had 
been mixing quite a lot of religious 
discussion in with the particle 
physics. (Strange thing, I never can 
figure out where physicists keep 
the Almighty, but they seem to be 
among His chief defenders these 
days.) Anyway, Harry had the com- 
plete story of the Great Pupa. 
“Well, you know the Cygnians 

IF

are hatched from eggs, and they go 
through a metamorphosis later in- 
to the adult form weVe met. Their 
religion is based on the belief that 
there is a further metamorphosis 
into a form with wings. Yes, wings. 
Beautiful, really. It has only hap- 
pened once, when the Great Pupa 
achieved it. He was persecuted and 
tortured. They have — or had — a 
rather dreadful method of execution 
in which the victim is wrapped in 
acid-soaked cloth and his flesh 
eaten away alive. That’s the figure 
on the pole. You do see the primitive 
parallel?” Harry interrupted him- 
self. 

We nodded silently, staring at a 
new and different Harry. 

‘‘Yes. Well, in his agony, the 
Great Pupa achieved the ultimate 
metamorphosis and appeared to his 
followers afterwards as d winged 
shape . Profoundly amazing, 
isn’t it? Over eleven light-years 
away . 

He told us that he had invited 
S’serrrop to attend church services 
with him that Sunday. Did we re- 
alize no Cygnian had actually en- 
tered a Terran house of worship? 
We also soon realized how S’serrrop 
felt about it. Frightened and revolt- 
edy but resolute. When we met them 
after the service his crest iwas still 
half retracted. 

Harry had been expounding 
Christian doctrine to him. The 
Cygnian was so excited that we 
could barely understand the bar- 



rage of clicks. ‘‘Abast! Abast!” he 
exclaimed. We took this as amazed 
— or perhaps abased? He desired 
more information, and Tillie volun- 
teered to find him a religious dic- 
tionary in which he could explore 
Moslem and Hindu, Greek; Roman 
and Hebrew doctrines as well as 
Harry’s Massachusetts Avenue rites. 
We saw Harry’s face cloud; Tillie 
told me that he became deeply 
exercised over questions like the 
propriety of using candles. 

Ill 

'^ext morning, I went into 
Harry’s office, feeling a fairly 
strong shade of yellow myself. He 
was doodling on his blackboard. 

“First of all, Harry, congratula- 
tions. The array of talent around 
here never ceases to amaze me. 
But — bear with me — there’s one 
thing I’d like to get straight. Are 
you absolutely one hundred per cent 
satisfied with the official estimate 
of the aggressive capabilities of that 
ship?” 

He looked at me from his Galac- 
tic evangelical dream. 

“You mean, weapons?” 

“Weapons. Blow-pipes, atomic 
disintegrators, germ cultures — call 
me a paranoid bastard, Harry. 
What could they do to us if they 
tried ?’^ 

“Well,” he said slowly, “Really 
not muA, Max. They have that 
shorMwge laser, wd they have

about fifty tactical atomic missiles, 
with less advanced fusing than ours. 
Slow. Their auxiliary craft can’t go 
much over Mach I all out. Very vul- 
nerable. They have no laboratories 
Of culture stores. A bare minimum 
of machining facilities. Their main 
craft certainly couldn’t be used as 
a mobile torch in atmosphere. They 
haven’t got the right guidance sys- 
tems for space attack. 1 think the 
estimate is quite correct; the most 
they could do would be a few lucky 
hits on big targets before our de- 
fenses overtook them.” 

He XXd out a couple of equa- 
tions, angrily. 

“Harry, is there anything about 
that ship you don’t imderstand?” 
“No. If you mean, in general. Oh, 
maybe — ” 

“Maybe?” 

“There are one or two large gen- 
erators which seem to be beyond 
their power needs, that’s all. Just 
generators. They may have been in 
the ship when the Siggies got it, 
perhaps for powering a ground in- 
stallation. What’s eating you. Max? 
Here we have one of the biggest — 
I’m not afraid to say it, one of the 
sweetest things possible to conceive 
of . Probably you don’t get it. 
Max. I feel sorry for you. I pity 
all atheists. But others do get it.” 
“I guess I don’t get it, Harry, 
but I’ll tell you what’s wrong with 
me. I’ve read history. Earth history. 
A big strange ship full of religious 
Qunbols — an alien race, fervently 



religious and revolted by the prac- 
tices of the natives — doesn’t that 
remind you of anything, Harry? No 
beU?” 

“Sorry, it doesn’t,” he said. He 
erased the blackboard. Our comfy 
little shop had been invaded in 
more ways than one. 

I t got invaded some more next 
day when S’serrrop tiurned up af- 
ter his session with Tillie’s diction- 
ary. We learned about another 
Cygnian emotion, but we weren’t 
sure at the time what it was. At 
first we thought he was sick. He 
kept making a rustling, flittering 
noise which we saw were his exo- 
skeletal joints snicking together. He 
said he wasn’t sick, it was some- 
thing else. 

“Is bad,” he kept repeating. 
“Bad! Sadi Hew — I caddot say 
— hew so simplel So be-hewtifuti 
Kch, too badi KCHKCHCHl” 
Convulsively his elbows began 
rubbing against his thorax in a blur 
of motion. A thin shriek rent the 
air. 

Tillie grabbed one of his vibrating 
hands, and he grabbed back. Hand- 
holding seemed to be the same on 
Cygnus as it was on Terra. He 
stopped the cicada wail and looked 
gravely in our faces. Then he said 
something that rocked even Harry. 

“So far-r-rl So bady he-years of 
glightl” He spead his arms in what 
we had come to know as the Great 
Pupa wing symbol. “He is hee-yar 



136 



IF 




tool” he exclaimed. The next min- 
ute he was striding down the hall 
in the general direction of Rock 
Creek Fark^ with his UnFo guard 
scrambling after. 

Two hours later we discovered he 
had stampeded State into flying him 
back to his group, who were touring 
Mexico. He said he had something 
urgent to tell them. 

In the turmoil, there arrived a 
covert signal from George. As pre- 
dicted, our Chief Linguist was 
shacked up with his explosive lexi- 
cal treasure around the far side 
from Mersenius, and playing doggo. 
He had found an old pal at Mer- 
senius to pass on a message demand- 
ing data on the Cygnians. The sig- 
nal ended, “Don’t trust those poly- 
unsaturated pygmies.” 

“Small men loathe each other,” 
Tillie commented. 

Of course you realize that the 
Cygnians had a written language 
in addition to the cartoon figures 
they used for first contact, but 
George hadn’t seen it before he left. 
I rooted out the negatives of the 
script-covered missile George was 
working on. They looked pretty 
bad. Can you imagine a Chinese 
trying to decipher Ne pas se pencher 
en dehors in five European lan- 
guages? Well, there were about five 
hundred choice graffiti on each neg- 
ative; some you wouldn’t believe.” 

“Tillie girl, can you locate 
Cygnian script among any of 
these?” 



“I don’t know. But I’ll try.” 
“What about those tech manuals 
they gave us, can’t you compare 
scripts?” 

“They were in the script of who- 
ever built the ship, and mostly dia- 
grams and math.” 

“Well, don’t We have any Cygn- 
ian sanq)les?” 

“Mostly their cursive.” 

Oomething was all wrong, all right. 

She was as stiff as an offended 
librarian. I pulled her around. 

“So you think I’m a stinker. 
Give me a break. Remember it’s 
just that old heathen Max, who 
scares easy.” 

“I think you’re being unforgiv- 
able to Harry,” she started. Then 
she squinted at me through her 
swag of hair. “Max, are you really 
scared?” 

“You bet I am. Honey, I’m so 
scared I even think about it in bed.” 
“But what o/. Max?” 

“Oh, history, micro-macro paral- 
lelism — I don’t know. That’s the 
worst of it. See what you can get 
out of these, would you?” 

She tried, but it was no go all 
Tuesday. And Wednesday you re- 
member what happened. 

The West-Hemisphere group of 
Siggies were holding their evening 
sing-in on the plaza outside the 
Catadrale de la Dama de something- 
or-other in Sao Faulo, BraziL In- 
side, a minor mass was about to be 
celebrated. Instead of their usual 



PUPA KNOWS BEST 



137 




circle, the Siggies formed a line 
across the front steps, and the hu- 
man worshippers fou^ themselves 
barred out 

A collide of clerics came out to 
protest The Siggies stood firm, 
singing. The crowd milled. A padre 
laid hands on a Siggie, who yielded, 
but anotha: took his place. The 
Sound mounted. The cathedral bells 
started tolling. Somebody called the 
police, who added sirens to the up- 
roar. At the height of the confu- 
sion two Siggies — bright orange 
with emotion — marched into the 
nave and up to the altar, where 
they deposited a small object. Then 
they mardied out again and re- 
joined the singing. 

Half a minute later the altar area 
of the cathedral lit up, gave off an 
amazing sound, and esploded into 
a flour-like dust idiich towered up 
over the plaza and came down all 
over ever^ody. 

In the melee, the Siggies with- 
drew to the far side of the plaza 
and formed a circle. It was shortly 
discovered that they were now pro- 
tected by some kind of force-shield, 
presumably generated by a large 
box which they always carried with 
them. Defense R&D had identified 
it as a musical amplifier. 

While we were digesting this, 
news came that the East-Hem- 
isphere Siggie group had pulled an 
almost identical stunt, resulting in 
major damage to the Golden Pavil- 
ion in Kyoto. 



IV 

'^he fact that the Cygnian ship’s 
^ auxiliary flyers were both out 
on what was described as routine 
maintenance tests had up to now 
escaped notice. After a pause, it 
became apparent where they were 
flying to. Harry’s evaluation sources 
had been quite right; they were 
slow. It took the one on our side 
over six hours to get from Quebec 
S,SOO air miles, to the little group 
in the plaza at Sao Paulo. En 
route, one of our more enterprising 
neighbors discovered that it too was 
now protected by an unknown form 
of shielding. As it made its weary 
Mach I way home with the West- 
Hemisphere Siggies aboard, our Air 
Force confirmed this the expensive 
way. 

Somewhere along the line the 
main ship had englobed itself too, 
with eight Terran technical people 
aboard. 

“Well, I guess we know what 
the generators are for now,” I re- 
marked next morning, roaming 
restlessly around Harry’s office. 

“An interesting tactical problem,” 
I mused. “What can you do with a 
measley few old badly guided fu- 
sion bombs — provided you can 
carry them anywhere you want in 
perfect safety?*^ 

He slammed his papers down 
hard and inhaled and ^aled ex- 
pbsively. Just as he inhaled again 
his phone rang. 



138 



IF 





“Huh? Who — who? Get him 
down here! WeVe got to get him 
down here? What? All right. I’ll 
go through your damn channels — 
He banged the phone down. 

“Max. They opened the ship long 
enough to turn loose our techs. 
S’serrrop came out with them. He’s 
been hurt. Get the chief to get 
him.^’ 

It was Tillie who got him, but 
how she did it I don’t know, be- 
cause our chief, like everybody 



and the BaHai Temple in Chicago, 
the newscasters hit stride. From 
there on — you’ll remember — it 
was just one bewildered yell of out- 
rage. The Moslem world held aloof 
until Friday, when the Blue Mos- 
que of Ahmed at Istanbul went up 
in flour. For all that first week, 
no one was killed or even badly 
hurt. 

Except S’serrrop. 

We met his stretcher at An- 
drews Air Base. He seemed glad to

oscillation over the Siggie atroci- ”I trite,” he shrilled feebly. 'T

message. Our medicos couldn’t do 
much for the alien biology beyond 
the obvious topical applications. 
Like a burned human, he was in 
toxemia. 

^T^hat was the morning the 
Cygnians started their broad- 
casts. It was now clear why they 
had been so eager to learn our lan- 
guages, but even so, you’ll recall 
that the first messages were more 
stimulating than enlightening. Our 
shop had the advantage of an early 
copy of the eight technician’s re- 
ports. The Cygnians had given them 
an intensive briefing before they 
let them go. 

« — Delusions of nonpersecution. 
Harry, I’m sorry.” 

He was head-in-hands, down. 
“When you look at the history 
of the early Christian missionaries, 
say in Polynesia, or Africa — ” 
“Damnation, Max, do you think 
you’re the only one who’s read 
history? It was just that — my 
fault — I saw the Gestalt the 
wrong way. From their point of 
view, we’re the heathen. You don’t 
need to rub it in. They never even 
bothered to try to understand — ” 
“How many missionaries ever 
tried to understand the native re- 
ligions? They just threw down the 
idols, burned the ju-jus, destroyed 
the temples . Disgusting! Un- 
speakable savage rites, I believe was 
the standard phrase.” 

“Only S’serrrop. He tried.” 



“Yes, he tried. He’s a believer 
too, of course, but liberal. What it 
adds up to, Harry, is a bunch of 
dedicated, primitive fundamenta- 
lists who bought themselves a boat 
and set out to bring the word to 
the heathen. With atomics.” 
“Missionaries with fissionaries,” 
squeaked Mrs. Peabody, and shut 
up abruptly. ’ 

“I blame myself — ” 

“Don’t, Harry. What could a 
Bushman make of a gun until he’d 
seen it fired? He’d have put it 
down as a clumsy kind of club. 
We’d never seen a generator used to 
throw a standing force field.” 

“But how can they hope to suc- 
ceed?” Tillie asked. “It’s so crazy! 
To make the whole population of 
earth worship the Great Pupa? We 
aren’t even the same kind of ani- 
mal! It’s insane.” 

“What do you think the Holy 
Family looked like to a polygamous 
culture where a man’s father was 
his mother’s brother? No, insane 
or not, conversion by the sword 
can work. What’s our price for 
saving St. Peter’s, or Westminster, 
or Santa Sophia, for starters? Or the 
Kremlin? Friends, don’t be too sure. 
You’ll be attending Great Pupa 
services in Carter Barron Ampi- 
theatre in the near future, I promise 
you.” 

“What about you?” snapped Til- 
lie. 

“Purification,” Harry was mut- 
tering. “Fire.”

IF 




His eyes were pale and clear, like 
a Weimeraner’s. 

“The early Christians survived, 
Max* Underground, in the cata- 
combs. In the days of the martyrs. 
From persecution will come re- 
birth.” 

I refrained from asking him to 
name a few aboriginal religions 
which had survived in pure form. I 
had something else to worry about. 

“Can S’serrrop talk at all. Til- 
lie? It^s urgent.” 

TT^ell, you recall what went on 
then, the public convulsions, 
the predictable and pathetic brave 
re^nses we made to the Cygnian’s 
simple ultimatum. I guess what riled 
people the most was the level of 
their pitch. They had apparently 
tagged us as Stone Age Stanley. 
“You can see the Great Pupa is 
the true god, because our we^ons 
are stronger than yours. Your false 
gods cannot protect themselves. Or 
you.” Right off page one of a nine- 
teenth-century missionary hand- 
book. The part about them ending 
our local strife in universal brother- 
hood as children of the Great Pupa 
wasn’t so bad, although I don’t 
think people went for the idea of 
themsdves as larvae. But when they 
got into the higher doctrinal mys- 
teries — and what they proposed 
to do about our sex and mating 
customs, they being biologically 
rather different — 

It was while they were explaining 



that aspect that the Aussie CinC 
up in Quebec laid our biggest nu- 
clear egg neatly on the Cygnian 
ship. The broadcast stopped. Two 
days later when things settled 
down, the ship was still sitting 
there englobed with debris. After 
awhile, a new type of transmission 
came put of the force-shell, and 
every piece of metal several kilo- 
meters beyond the blast-hole went 
to vapor. Then the religious broad- 
casts resumed. The Great Pupa was 
indeed a strong god. 

Over everybody’s protests, I tried 
to get S’serrrop to locate and deci- 
pher any Cygnian text he could find 
on my photos of George’s missile. 

“What in hell do you expect to 
prove. Max? Even if there’s a 
Cygnian text, so what? We know 
the story now.l’ 

we? I thought you said 
you’d read history.” 

But S’serrrop was nearly blind, 
and terribly weak. He did appear 
to recognise the photos. 

“Too bad I” he whispered again. 
“Kchchl Too bad . .” 

“Leave him alone. Max.” 

“Wait I S’serrrop — Tillie, ask 
him this: Are there others? More 
like him? Coming here?” 

We coxddn’t get his answer, but 
as you know, we were not left long 
in doubt. 

S ince this is just the inside story, 
I won’t go into all the uproar 
and stuff you know — the steady

attrition of our religious monuments 
— don’t think Chartres didn’t rock 
me — the efforts of the Vatican 
and the International Council of 
Churches of Christ to negotiate 
some kind of co-existence for the 
West at least — the day the Sig- 
gies, by an understandable theologi- 
cal error, took out the New York 
Stock Exchange — the United Arab 
kamikazi attempt — the successful 
assault on two isolated Siggies in 
Pakistan — the Soviet proposal — 
you know all that. The inside story 
isn’t much, here: Sixteen long go- 
arounds between me and our chief, 
ending in stalemate. And then the 
second Cygnian ship arrived. 

It put down in the North African 
desert. Same general type, a bit 
newer and knobbier, and coppery 
rather than gold. The same opening 
ceremonies, but these Siggies were 
definitely orange — the Red Sig- 
gies as they were dubbed. As you 
can imagine, the welcoming com- 
mittee was conspicuously absent. 
“Reinforcements?” Tillie asked. 
“I devoutly hope so,” I said. She 
gave me the look I was getting used 
to those days. 

“IVe got to see S’serrrop.” 

“You’ll kill him. Max.” 

She was right. When S’serrrop 
saw the photos of the new Cygn- 
ians he went — or tried to go — 
into his shivering and stridulating 
act. It seemed to be involuntary, 
like uncontrollable sobs. He couldn’t 
stop himself from knocking the 



dressings around. Not that they 
were doing him any good, but the 
result was horrible. In his agony 
he could barely be understood. 
What came through clearly at the 
end was: “I trite I I trite 1” And 
then something so obviously a pri- 
vate prayer that I snapped the re- 
corder off. He died that night. 

I spent the night with that tape 
and was waiting on the chief’s door- 
mat with my reconstruction in the 
morning. At noon he was still not in. 
His hot-line girl told me about the 
fire-fight between Yellow Siggie 
and Red Siggie flyers, in which 
most of Marseilles had come up 
missing. 

V 

A t 1500 the chief was still going 
’round in the high level whirl- 
wind. I decided to take — it says 
here on my citation — independent 
initiative. What the hell, how much 
Class A office furniture do you get 
in a catacomb? I had nothing to 
lose. 

The independence took the form 
of a structure of tastefully forged 
directives and speciously worded 
coordinating concurrences, at the 
end of which chain of duplicity 
there emerged in about 60 hours 
time one live Astromarine lieuten- 
ant He looked exactly like a screen 
space hero except he had cold- 
sores. He contributed the action. 

By this time the Red Siggies — 



142 



IF 




who seemed to be faster workers 
and more practical-minded — had 
decided that it would make for 
more togetherness if we evacuated 
our lunar bases. There was to be 
just one shuttle-run per each, and 
Mersenius was unluckily scheduled 
as Number Two. You’d be up all 
night if I told you what it took 
to get that boy into a disguised 
cargo-pod. Harry, who knew I was 
nuts but was too far gone to argue, 
helped a lot. After that we could 
only hope. 

By this point the bands were so 
loaded with Red and Yellow Siggie 
broadcasts and counter-broadcasts 
and doctrinal trumpetings and coun- 
ter-counter-jamming that we were 
virtually blind and deaf, elec- 
tronically speaking. To this day, I 
don’t understand the difference be- 
tween their versions of the Great 
Pupa religion. Something about the 
powers of the clergy and the exis- 
tence of other lesser Pupas or 
prophets. Harry is making a study 
of it. I was more concerned with 
tr 5 dng to keep score of the acciden- 
tal damage sustained by Earth when 
the Yellow and Red missionary fly- 
ers tangled. You remember how the 
media kept saying that they were 
decimating each other? Apparently, 
people outside really hoped that one 
side would eliminate the other at 
least, and maybe they might even 
kill each other off. The inside re- 
ports gave no such hope. There was 
no concrete evidence that they could 



do each other any serious damage 
and the side effects on us were 
brutal. Marseilles was the start; 
next came Altoona, of all places, 
and poor old Coventry, and Tan- 
giers. And a lot of sm^er things. 

”This ph^e won’t last,” I ponti- 
ficated. “The history of religious 
wars is like any other. Your main 
attack is not on the enemy lead- 
ers but on their followers. That’ll 
be us, when they get organized. 
We’ll have to sign up with one lot 
or the other, and ipyhen we do, 
we’ll get it. What’s the matter, 
Harry? In particular, I mean?” 
“Joddrell’s picked up a new type 
of transmission from both ships, 
beamed off-planet.” 

“Calling for reinforcements?” 
“Probably.” 

“And alles ganz kaput . Did 
you ever identify that planet 
S’serrrop described?” 

“Not positively. I personally 
think that was Cygnus 61. I don’t 
believe these creatures are Cygn- 
ians; they just came from Cygnus 
61 in the sense that that was the 
last place they stopped. Perhaps 
they were there quite some time — ” 
“Before they and their competi- 
tion managed to fracture the plan- 
etary crust.” 

”I wonder what the real Cyg- 
nians were like,” sighed Tillie. 

“What I wonder is where Lieuten- 
ant Stemhagen is. At least he wasn’t 
brought down in the Mersenius 
evacuation.” 



PUPA KNOWS BEST 



143 




A s it turned out, of course, Lieu- 
tenant Sternhagen was right 
where he was supposed to be. He 
had cleverly managed to unpack 
himself undetected after his ghastly 
trip in the pod and had slipped 
away on his march around to the 
far side. All we had been able 
to give him was a dinky personnel 
jato imit. After 70 hours of hop- 
ping, sliding, ghding and tumbling 
he reached George, who was bliss- 
fully holed up with his life work 
and a nice little hydroponics set-up 
he had wangled out of his Mersenius 
pals. The young Marine, as directed, 
asked George one or two pointed 
questions. The answers being on the 
right trajectory, Lieutenant Stern- 
hagen stayed not to argue, but in- 



jected a little ^eam-juice into 
George’s airlines. Then he had a 
busy time boosting the missile — 
carefully — out of the cave, carry- 
ing George over a couple of rim- 
walls and stowing him and laying 
a remote-control laser line. 

The thing went up beautifully as 
demonstrated, three shorts and a 
long, but of course we couldn’t see 
it on Terra. After that, the young 
Marine, who had received only mi- 
nor radiation burns in addition to 
his previously acquired contusions, 
had nothing to do except hop, slide 
and tumble 70 hours back to the 
empty Mersenius base, hauling a 
hysterical George, who was undam- 
aged except in his aspiration-level. 

By a miracle, Mersenius had 




registered our covert signal and left 
sufficient supplies to allow the pair 
to survive until rescue, during wWch 
time George had the opportunity 
to say everything he wanted to, 
about fifteen thousand times. It 
doesn^t tell half enough on Lieu- 
tenant Sternhagen’s medal. 

After this, there was nothing at 
all to do but wait. And wait. And 
wait. The rest of the world, who 
weren’t waiting for anything, just 
reacted. You know. Fortunately the 
loss of human life was amazingly 
low as yet, except for Marseilles 
and Altoona, where the Yellow Sig- 
gies had been holding a mass out- 
door Great Pupa baptism ceremony. 
I’ll say this for the Siggies, they 
were brave. The Yellow Siggie con- 
ducting services didn’t even look up 
when the Red flyer came over — 
just sang harder. Glory, glory. 

The weapon they chiefly used 
was a variant of the catalytic va- 
porizer business. R&D had not 
guessed that it could be produced 
as a rather bountiful fuel by-pro- 
duct. We counted a total of only 
five actual missiles expended to 
date. If the Red Siggies had 
brought in another fifty, that left 
ninety-five to go. Their fall-out 
proved to be rather more copious 
than the best art, too. 

During the next week, two of our 
tracking stations got melted domi, 
and we were down to our last ear- 
flaps when we caught a new ship 
coming in. 



“The reinforcements,” Harry 
said. He had taken to shadow- 
boxing the eraser, very softly. 

“Why?” 

“Both Siggie ships are transmit- 
ting like mad.” 

But it wasn’t their reinforce- 
ments. 

The little blue ship made one 
orbit and then came in low over 
North Africa and on to Quebec. 
When it had passed, both Siggie 
ships were still there and apparent- 
ly undamaged, but they had lost 
some of their shine. On the ground, 
the Siggie groups were scrambling 
first for cover and then for their 
ships. We only caught part of the 
saurian transmission on Cygnese — 
something about one planetary ro- 
tation. 

^X^hirty hours later both Red and 
-*■ Yellow Siggies were on their 
way out of our system, leaving us 
mth four smashed cities, innumer- 
able wrecked houses of religion, and 
more maypole effigies of the Great 
Pupa then could be coimted before 
they were melted down. The blue 
lizards left too — we still don’t 
know where they’re from, 

“You guessed they were cops 
. How?” said Harry, when we 
were celebrating George’s return. 
After blowing out his outrage on 
Stemhagen, George had more or 
less run down about the criminal 
destruction of his Galactic key.

them as two guys in a squad car, 
it all fit. They couldn’t stick 
around. Thqr set up call-boxes. One 
demonstration of bow to work it, 
good-bye. Holler if you need help, 
right, George? Tell me, old brother, 
how long had you known? Never 
mind, don’t answer that. I respect a 
man who values knowledge more 
than the mere survival of his cul- 
ture. Not to say his species. I 
won’t ask you if you would ever 
have got ’round to triggering it — ” 
“Maxi” shouted Tillie. 

“All right. There was a report 
that these so-called Cygnians, may- 
be others too, were messing around 
with backward planets. Somewhere, 
there’s a minor policy directive. 
Pressure from a Society to Save Our 
Seminoles. Low budget. Two guys 
to cover a sector. Probably left a 
set of flares around any number of 
likely planets. The Siggies knew 
damn well what they were, too.” 
"Is that like history?” ventmed 
Mrs. Peabody. 

"Not really. Certainly not in the 
old days. The poor benighted heath- 
en caught in sectarian wars just 
suffered. Did any of you read 
about what happened to people who 
happened to be in the paA of a 
crusade, by the way? We’ve missed 
that, so far.” 

"TTidr religion was sort of poet- 
ic in a way. I mean, chan^ng to 
wings — ” 

I saw Harry vdnce. 



“Tell you what isn’t so beautiful, 
if you want more history. This is 
all early-stage stuffs. Informal wild- 
catting. Like when Tahiti or the 
Congo were months away from 
Europe, and North America was 
half wild. What happens now we 
got saved? Do we go back to our 
palm-trees and peace?” 

“Why not?” shrugged Tillie. 
Then she said, “Oh.” 

"Exactly, l^^t happened when 
industrial nation-states got organ- 
ized into coalitions and went to war 
for global mastery? What happens 
to the people in the sarongs when 
something like Admiral Tojo’s fleet 
smls into the lagoon to set up a 
fortified base? And something like 
Admiral Nimitz’ fleet and the Allied 
Air Force arrives to throw him out?” 
“. And Eniweitok,” murmured 
Harry. 

Pouring George a drink, she 
asked, “Did any of you know how 
old S’serrrop was?” 

"Huh?” 

"A kid. About like our nineteen. 
He got involved with the natives 
and felt sorry for us and begged 
the heads of ^e mission to leave us 
alone, because the Great Pupa’s 
spirit had already touched us, in 
another form. That made him a 
heretic.” 

“Any parallels on that. Max?” 
We iwent to bed on that one and 
I’ll leave it with you. Along with 
the original meaning of the word 
Bikini. END

IF 




(Continued from page 98) 
"Hanardy has a memory of some- 
thing, Fat. That’s all. And that is 
aU there is. That’s all that’s left of 
the Great Galactics.” 

Pat gasped, "If it’s nothing, 
why are you scared?” 

"It’s not quite nothing,” Sween- 
Madro replied patiently. "There is 
a — potential. One chance in a mil- 
lion. I don’t want him to have any 
chance to use it, though of course 
well presently have to take a 
chance with him and put him into 
a state of sleep.” 

He rdeased her and stepped 
ba<i. No, no, my dear, there’s no 
possible diance of you making use 
of some special abOity in Hanardy 
— became I know h^s over there 
by the door. And he can’t move 
fast enough to get over here and 
hit me with that metal bar.” 

The tense Hanardy sagged. And 
Fat Ungarn seemed frozen, glaring 
at the creatme. She came back to 
life, abruptly. "I know you don’t 
dare shoot Steve. So why don’t 
you shoot me?” Her tone was up 
in pitch, challenging. 

"HqtI” said Hanardy. "Carefull” 
"Don’t worry, Steve,” she an- 
swered gdly without turning 
around. "It’s not because I have 
any I.Q. potentialities. But he won’t 
touch me either. He knows you like 
me. You might have a bad thou^t 
about him at a key moment, later. 
Isn’t that right, Mr. Dreegh? I’ve 
got your little dilemma figured out, 



haven’t I, even though I’ve only 
got a Klugg brain.” 

Her words seemed suicidal to 
Hanardy. But Sween-Madro just 
stood gazing at her, swaying a lit- 
tle, saying nothing — a naked 
scarecrow of a man from the wtd^ 
up, and below, wearing knee-lengA 
dungarees over bone-thin legs. 

Yet there was no belief in Han- 
ardy that the Dreegh was vulner- 
able. He remembered the other’s 
high speed movements — that 
seemingly instantaneous transition 
from one location in space to an- 
other . from the bed to Pat, at 
invisible speed. Fantastic! 

Once more Pat’s voice broke the si- 
lence, mockingly: "What’s this? An 
I.Q. of 400 or 500 baffled? Doesn’t 
know what to do? Remember, no 
matter what action you take, he 
can’t stay awake mu^ longer. It’s 
only a matter of time before some- 
thing has to give.” 

At that point, another sharp anx- 
iety struck through Hanardy. He 
thought: She’s wasting time. Ev- 
ery minute those other Dreeghs are 
getting closer! 

The thought was so urgent in his 
nund, he spoke it aloud, "For 
Pete’s sake. Miss Pat, those other 
Dreeghs’ll be here any second — ” 
"Shut up, you fool!” 

Instantly shrill, hysterical, terri- 
fied — that was her totally unex- 
pected reaction. 

She said something else in that 
same high-pitched tone, but Han- 



THE PROXY INTEILICENCE

Bxiy did not hear it dearly. For in 
that moment between his own 
wtrds and hers, the Dreegh turned. 
Aitd his arm moved. That was all 
that was visible. Where did it move 
to? The super-speed of the move- 
ment blurr^ that. It could only, 
logically, have been toward the 
pocket of his dimgarees, but noth- 
ing like that was visible. 

A weapon glittered; a beam of 
light toudied Hanardy’s face. 

As blackness swept over him, he 
resized what else it was the girl 
had said: "Steve, he’ll put you to 
sleep while that thought about the 
Dreegh’s coming quickly is in your 
mind. ’’ 

VIII 

H ow swiftly can transition be- 
tween wakefulness and sleep 
take place? 

As long as it requires for the 
wakefulness center to shut off and 
the sleep center to turn on. 

So there is no sq)parent consdous 
time lag. If you live a dull, human 
existence, it seems brief enough. 

To Hanardy, who was normally 
duller than most, it seemed no 
time at all. 

He started forward, his lips part- 
ed to speak — and he was already 
asleep ... so far as he — the self 
— was aware. He did have a vague 
feeling of starting to fall. 

Consciously, nothing more oc- 
curred. 



Below the conscious, there was 
a measiurable lapse of time. 

During that time, the particles 
inside the atoms of his body did 
millions of millions of separate ac- 
tions. And molecules by the quad- 
rillion maneuvered in the twilight 
zone of matter. Because of the 
thought that had been in Hanardy’s 
mind, at some level of his brain he 
noticed exact spots of space, saw 
and identified the other-ness of 
the Dreeghs in the approaching 
Dreegh ship, estimated their other- 
whereness, computed the mathe- 
matics of change. It was simple in 
the virtual emptiness of space, dif- 
ficult where matter was dense. But 
never impossible. 

As he did so, the Dreegh ship with 
its eight Dreeghs changed location 
from one spot to another exact spot 
in space, bridging the gap through 
a lattice-work of related spots. 

In the bedroom in the meteorite, 
the visible event was that Hanardy 
fell. A twisting fall, it was, where- 
by he sprawled on his side, the arm 
with the metal bar in it partly un- 
der him. 

As Hanardy collapsed to the 
floor, the Dreegh walked past Pat 
toward the open door behind it. 
Reaching it, he clutched at it, seem- 
ingly for support. 

Pat stared at him. After what had 
happened she didn’t quite dare to 
believe that his apparent weakness 
was as great as i^e saw it to be. 

Yet after a little, she ventiured. 



148 



IF 




'^May I ask my father a question?” 

There was no answer. The 
Dreegh stood at the door, and he 
seemed to be clinging to it. 

Excitement leaped through the 
girl. 

Suddenly she dared to accept the 
reality of the exhaustion that was 
here. The Dreegh’s one mighty ef- 
fort had depleted him, it seemed. 

She whirled and raced over to 
Hanardy, looking for the metal 
bar. She saw at once that he was 
lying on top of it and tried to roll 
him over. She couldn’t. He seemed 
to be solidly imbedded in the floor 
in that awkward position. 

But there was no time to waste! 
Breathing hard, she reached un- 
der him for the metal weapon, 
found it, tugged at it. 

It woddn’t budge. 

Pull at it, twist it, exert all her 
strength — it was no use. Hanardy 
had a vice-like grip on the bar, 
and his body weight reinforced that 
grip. Nothing she could do could 
move it, or him. 

Pat believed the position, the im- 
movability, was no accident. Dis- 
mayed, she thought the Dreegh 
caused him to fall like that. 

She felt momentarily awed. What 
an amazing prediction ability 
Sween-Madro had had — to have re- 
alized the nature of the danger 
against him and taken an exact 
defense against it. 

It was a maneuver designed to 
defeat, exactly and precisely, a 



small Klugg woman, whose abili^^ 
at duplication coidd not lighten 
the weight of a body like Han- 
ardy’s enough to matter and whose 
ability to solve problems did not 
include the ability to unravel a 
muscularly knotted hand grip. 

B ut — she was on her feet, in- 
finitely determined — it would 
do him no good! ' 

The Dreegh also had a weapon. 
His only hope must be that she 
wouldn’t dare come near him. 

Instants later, she was daring. 
Her trembling fingers fumbled over 
his dungarees, seeking openings. 
They found nothing. 

But he had a weapon, she told 
herself, bewildered. He fired it at 
Steve. I saw him! 

Again, more frantically, she 
searched all the possibilities of the 
one garment he wore — in vain. 

She remembered, finally, in her 
desperation, that her father must 
have been watching this room. He 
might have seen where it was. , 
”Dadl” she called anxiously. 
^'Yes, my dear?” The reply from 
the intercom came at once, reassur- 
ingly calm. 

Watching the Dreegh warily, she 
asked, ”Do you have any advice 
on how to kill him?” 

The old man, sitting in the con- 
trol room of the meteorite, feighed. 
From his viewpoint, he could on one 
viewplate see the girl, Hanardy’s 
unconscious body and Sween-Mad- 



THE PROXY INTELLIGENCE 



149 




ro; on another he observed gloom- 
ily that the Dreegh ship had ar- 
rived and had attached to an air- 
lock. As he watched that second 
viewplate, three men and five wom- 
en came out of the ship and into 
a corridor of the meteorite. It was 
obvious that killing Sween-Madro 
was no longer of value. 

The girPs voice cut across his 
awareness. ^^He must have used 
the super-speed again without my 
noticing and hidden his weapon. 
Did 5TOU see what he did with it?” 

W^t Professor Ungarn was see- 
ing was that the newly arrived 
Dreeg^hs, though in no hurry, were 
heading directly toward Madro and 
Pat. 

Watching them, the professor 
thought, Pat was right. Sween- 
Madro had been vunerable. He 
could have been killed. But it was 
too late. 

Sick with self-recrimination he 
abandoned the control room and 
hurried to join his daughter. 

B y the time he arrived, Sween- 
Madro was back in the bed, 
and Hanardy had been lifted onto 
a powered dolly which had been 
wheeled alongside a machine that 
had evidently been brought from 
the Dreegh ship. 

The machine was a simple de- 
vice with a pair of bulbous, trans- 
parent cups and a suction system. 
A needle was inserted into a blood 
vessel on Hanardy’s right arm. 



Swiftly, a turgid bluish-red liquid 
rose in one of the bulbous cups; 
about a quart. Professor Ungarn 
estimated to his daughter in a 
whisper. 

One by one, wordlessly, the 
Dreeghs went to the machine. An- 
other needle was used. And into 
each a tiny drain of blood siphoned 
from the red stuff in the bulbous 
cup. It seemed as if about half of 
it was taken. 

Still without anyone speaking, 
the needle was inserted into Sween- 
Madro^s arm; and the rest of the 
blood from the cup flowed into 
him. 

Pat stared at the dreadful be- 
ings with avid curiosity. All her 
life she had heard of, and been 
warned against, these creatures; 
and here they were from all those 
distances of years and miles. Four 
men and five women. 

Three of the five women were 
brunette, one was a blonde; the fifth 
was a redhead. 

The women were, every one, tall 
and willowy. The men were uni- 
formly six feet four or five and 
gaunt of build. Was height a part 
of the Dreegh illness? Pal won- 
dered, seeing them together like 
this. Did Dreegh bones grow as a 
result of their disease? She could 
only wonder. 

The figure on the bed moved. 
Sween-Madro opened eyes and sat 
up. 

He seemed shaky and unsure. 



159 



IF 




Again, there was silent action. The 
Dree^ men did not move, but the 
women one by one went over and 
lightly kissed Sween-Madro on 
the lips. 

At each touch of lips there was 
a faint bluish light, a flash of 
brightness, like a spark. Invariably, 
the blue spark leaped from the 
woman to the man. 

And with gach flash he grew 
more alive. His body became vis- 
ibly larger. His eyes grew bright. 

Pat, who had been watching with 
total fascination, suddenly felt two 
pairs of hands grab her. She had 
time to let out a shriek as two 
Dreegh men carried her over to 
Sween and held her above him, her 
face over his. 

At the final moment, she ceased 
her futile struggle and froze. 

She was aware of Sween’s sar- 
donic eyes gazing up at her. Then, 
with a deliberate movement he 
raised his head and brushed her 
lips with his. 

She expected to die. 

Deep inside the back of her head, 
a fire started. The heat of it seem- 
ed instantly unbearable; instantly 
there was a flash of blue flame 
from her lips to his. 

Then she was back on the floor, 
dizzy, but — as she realized pres- 
ently — recovering. And still alive. 

Qween-Madro swung his feet over 
^ the edge of the bed and said, 
”The existence of such brother- 



and-sister energy flows, Pat — 
which you have now experienced 
— and the Dreegh ability to use 
them make it likely that we could 
become the most powerful beings 
in the galaxy on a continuing basis. 
If we can defeat Hanardy. We only 
took about ten percent from you. 
We don’t want you damaged — 
yet.” 

He stood up, walked over and 
looked down at the unconscious 
spaceman. Presently he beckoned 
Pat and Professor Ungarn; fa- 
ther and daughter came at once. 

The Dreegh said, 'T’m still not 
well. Can you detect any change 
in him?” He did not wait for a 
reply, but said in relief, guess 
nothing happened. He looks as low- 
grade a human as you could ever 
not want to meet or deal with in 
any way, and that’s the way he 
was before — don’t you agree?” 
Pat said quickly, "I don’t un- 
derstand. What did you expect?” 
” Hopefully, nothing,” was the 
reply. ”But that remark about how 
near our ship was was the first 
un-programmed use of his ability. 
A spatial relationship action like 
that comes in the Great Galactic 
intelligence curve at about I.Q. 
1200 .” 

''But what did you fear?” Pat 
persisted. 

"That it would feed back through 
his nervous system 1” 

"What would that do?” 

The Dreegh merely stared at her, 



THE PROXY INTELLIGENCE 



151 




sardonically. It was Professor Un- 
garn’s voice that finally broke the 
silence. "My dear, the Dreeghs are 
actually acting as if their only 
enemy is a programmed Hanardy.” 
"ITien you believe thdr analy- 
sis of the nature of the Great Ga- 
lactics?” 

"Th^ bdieve it; so I bdieve it.” 
"Then there’s no hope?” 

The old man point^ at Han- 
ardy. "There’s Steve.” 

"But he’s just a biun. That’s why 
we selected him to be our dray- 
horse, remember?” She spoke accus- 
ingly. "Because he was the dumb- 
est, most honest jo'k in the solar 
system — remember?” 

The old man nodded, suddenly 
looking gloonQT. Pat became aware 
that the Dreeghs were watching 
them, as if they were listening. 

It was one of the dark-haired 
women vdio i^ke. "My name is 
Bilke,” she said. She went on, in 
a low, hus^ voice, "What you’ve 
just describe — a man as tmim- 
portant as this one — is one of 
the reasons why we want to go to 
Europa. We must find out what 
did the Great Galactic see in this 
strange little man. We should 
know because for our blood stor- 
age tanks and energy pool we need 
the blood and life force of a mil- 
lion people from this otherwise un- 
defended i^anetary system. And we 
dare not kill a single one of those 
million until the riddle of Hanardy 
is resolved.” 



IX 

dke a sentient being — 
Everyone aboard the Dreegh 
super-ship that flew to the moon 
Europa in thirty hours (instead of 
many weeks) fitted that descrip- 
tion: the Dreeghs, Pat, Professor 
Ungarn, and the sleeping Hanardy. 

They had brought along Hanar- 
dy’s freighter to be thdr landing 
craft. They came down without in- 
cident into Hanardy’s permanent 
spaceship berth in Spaceport, the 
large moon’s prindpaJ dty. 

Consider any sentient person — 

That indudes a man adeep . 
like Hanardy. 

There he lies, helpless. In that 
fotuth sleep stage that Hanardy 
was in — the deep ddta-wave 
stage — push at him, hit him, roll 
him over. It is enormously difficult 
to awaken him. Yet it is in this 
state that a person can act out a 
sleepwalker’s strange goaL 

Force this sentient individual to 
interact with a grossly vast uni- 
verse — 

"We’re taking no chances,” said 
the Dreegji brunette woman, Ril- 
ke. "We’re going to bring him into 
motion on the somnambulistic 
level.” 

It was Sween who directed a 
bright light at Hanardy’s face; af- 
ter mere seconds, he shut it off. 

There was a measurable passage 
of time. Then the body on the bed 
stirred. 




152 



IF 




A second woman — the blonde 
— without glancing up from the 
instrument she was monitoring, 
made a gesture and said hurriedly, 
''The somnambulistic purpose is 
in the delta-wave band 3-10-13B.” 

It was a private nomenclature 
that meant nothing to Pat. But the 
words caused an unexpected flut- 
ter of excitement among the 
Dreeghs. 

Sween-Madro turned to Pat. 
"Have you any idea why Hanar- 
dy should want to visit with, and 
have a feeling of affection for, 
thirteen people in Spaceport?” 

Pat shrugged. "He associates 
with certain space bums around 
town,” she said contemptuously. 
"Typical hangers-on of the kind 
you find out in space. I wouldn’t 
waste a minute on them.” 

Sween said coldly, "We take no 
chances, Pat. The ideal solution 
would be to kill all thirteen. But if 
we do, Hanardy might have puni- 
tive dreams about us as he awak- 
ens — which awakening will hap- 
pen very soon now, one way or 
another. So — ” the long gaunt 
face cracked into a grimace of a 
smile — “we’ll render them useless 
to him.” 

"SssshI” said the blonde woman. 
She motioned toward the figure on 
the bed. 

The somnambulistic Hanardy 
had opened his eyes. 

Pat was aware, then, of the 
Dreeghs watching alertly. Invol- 



untarily, briefly, she held her 
breath and waited. 

H anardy did not glance at her 
or at the Dreeghs, showed no 
awareness of anyone else being in 
the room. 

Without a word, he got out of 
bed and removed his pajamas. 
Then he went into his bathroom 
and shaved and combed his hair. 
He came out again into the bed- 
room and began to dress, putting 
on his dirty pants, a shirt and a 
pair of boots. 

As Hanardy walked out of the 
room, Rilke shoved at Pat. "Re- 
main near the sleepwalker,” she 
commanded. 

Pat was aware that Rilke and 
Sween-Madro stayed close behind 
her. The others had slipped some- 
where out of sight. 

The somnambulistic Hanardy 
opened the airlock and beaded 
down the gangplank. 

Sween-Madro gestured with his 
head for Pat to follow. 

The girl had hesitated at the top 
of the spidery "plank.” And now 
she stood for a moment gazing out 
at the city of Spaceport. 

The airlock of Hanardy’s freight- 
er was located about fifty feet 
above the heavy lower scaffolding 
that held the vessel. There was a 
space of about five feet between 
the opening and the upper scaf- 
folding which actually constituted 
a part of the dock. 



THE PROXY INTELLIGENCE 



153 




Almost straight ahead of her 
Pat could see the first building of 
the city. It was hard for her to re- 
alize that the entire populace of 
the port, with all their available 
equipment, had no chance against 
the Dree^. There was no pro- 
tection here for her, or Hanardy, 
or anyone. 

Awe came. The decisive factor 
was the intdligence of the Dreeghs. 

She thought: and what’s in Steve’s 
memory of intelligence is aU that 
stands between these vampires and 
their victims. 

Minutes later she found herself 
walking beside Hanardy. She stole a 
glance at his blank face, so stolid 
and unintellectual. He seemed like 
a small hope, indeed. 

The Dreeghs and she followed 
Hanardy along a street, into a ho- 
tel, up an elevator and along a 
corridor to a door numbered SI 7. 
Hanardy pressed a little button, 
and after a little the door opened. 
A middle-aged woman shuffled in- 
to view. She was dumpy and bleary- 
eyed, but her face brightened into 
a welcoming smirk as she saw Han- 
ardy. 

''Hi, there, Hanl” she yelled. 

Having spoken, she must have 
realized that the Dreeghs and Pat 
were with the spaceman. If she had 
any defensive thought, it was too 
late. Sween made her helpless with 
his mechanical light-flash hypno- 
tism, about \^ch he commented 
casually after they were inside and 



the door shut, "Nothing more 
complex is needed for human be- 
ings, or — ” he shrugged — ^"Kluggs. 
Sorry, Pat,” he apologized to the 
girl, "but the fact is that, like the 
people of this system, you also 
have a vague idea that hypnotism 
and other non-consdous [dienomena 
were invented by hypnotists and 
similar unscrupubus people.” 

He added ruefully, "You’ll never 
surprise a Lennel, or a Medder, or 
a Hulak with any control method 
short of — ” He broke off. "Never 
mind I” 

T Te turned to the woman. Pres- 
^ ently, imder his guidance she 
was speaking enforced truths about 
her real relationship with Hanardy. 

From the time they had met, 
Hanardy had given her money. 

"What does he really get for it?” 
asked Rilke. 

"Nothing.” 

Since their method evoked only 
truth, Rilke frowned at Sween, "It 
couldn’t be altruism. Not on his 
low level?” 

It was visibly an unexpected de- 
velopment. Pat said scathingly, "If 
altruism is an I.Q. factor, you 
Dreeghs probably come in below 
idiot.” 

The man did not reply. The 
next instant his preternaturally 
long body was bending over the 
bloated female whom they had so 
briefly interrogated. There was a 
flash of blue as his lips touched 



154 



IF 




hers. Half a dozen times he repeat- 
ed that caricature of a kiss. Each 
time, the woman grew visibly small- 
er, like a sick person fading away 
on a hospital bed. 

Finally, a bright light was flash- 
ed into the tired eyes, excising all 
memory of her degradation. But 
when they departed, the shriveled 
being on the bed was still alive. 

The next person that the som- 
nambulistic Hanardy led them to 
was a man. And tWs time it was 
Rilke who took the glancing kiss, 
and it was into her nervous sys- 
tem that the blue fire was drawn. 

They drained aU thirteen of 
Hanardy ’s friends in the same way; 
and then they decided to kill Han- 
ardy. 

Grinning, Sween explained. 'Tf 
we blow him up with you, the 
woman for whom he feels a dumb 
devotion, standing beside him in 
his home port — the only home he 
knows — he’ll be busy protecting 
those he loves. And then we, who 
will be out in space while this is 
going on, will probably survive the 
few instants that it will take for 
him to awaken.” 

As she heard those words, Pat 
felt a hardening of her own re- 
solve, a conviction that she had 
iK)thing to lose. 

They had started up the metal 
gangplank that led to the airlock 
of Efanardy’s ship. Hanardy walk- 
ed blankly in front, behind him was 
the girl, then Rilke, and, bringing 



up the rekr, Sween. And they 
reached the final few feet, Pat 
braced herself and spoke aloud. 

”It seems wrong, — ” she said. 

And leaped forward. She put her 
hands against Hanardy and shov- 
ed him over the side of the plank. 

As she expected, the Dreeghs 
were quick. Bianardy was still tee- 
tering over the fifty-foot drop

reached down. That swiftly they 
had him. 

In pushing at Hanardy, Pat 
found herself automatically pro- 
pelled by the effort of her thrust 
away from Hanardy and over the 
other edge of the plank.

Qpaceport, on Europa, like other 
^ similar communities in the 
solar system, was not at all like an 
ordinary liffle town of four thou- 
sand human bdngs. If anything, it 
resembled an old-style naval re- 
fuding station in the South Pacific, 
with its military establishment 
and garrison. Except that the gar- 
rison” of Spaceport consisted of 
technical experts who worked in 



THE PROXY INTELLIGENCE 



155 




complex mechanical systems for the 
repair and servicing of spaceships. 
In addition, Spaceport was a min- 
ing post, where small craft brought 
their meteorite ore, gigantic plants 
separated the precious from the 
debris, and the resultant refined 
materials were trans-shipped to 
Earth. 

The similarity to a South Pacific 
port was borne out in one other 
respect. Exactly as each little is- 
land post of Earth’s Pacific Ocean 
gradually accumulated a satura- 
tion of human flotsam and jetsam, 
so on Spaceport there had gather- 
ed a strange tribe of space bums. 
The tribe consisted of men and 
women in almost equal numbers, 
the size of the group being vari- 
able. Currently, it consisted of 
thirteen persons. They were not ex- 
actly honest people, but they were 
not criminals. That was impossible. 
In space, a person convicted of one 
of the basic crimes was automati- 
cally sent back to Earth and not 
allowed out again. However, there 
was a great tolerance aimong en- 
forcement officials as to what con- 
stituted a crime. Not drunkenness, 
certainly, and not dope addiction, 
for either men or women. Any de- 
gree of normal sex, paid for or not, 
was never the subject of investiga- 
tion. 

There was a reason for this lati- 
tude. The majority of the persons 
involved — men and women — 
were technically trained. They 



were bums because they couldn’t 
hold a steady job, but during rush 
periods, a personnel officer of the 
pressured company coidd often be 
found down in the bars on Front 
Street looking for a particular in- 
dividual, or group. The bums thus 
located might then earn good mon^ 
ey for a week or two, or perhaps 
even three. 

It was exactly such a personnel 
officer looking for exactly such lost 
souls who discovered all thirteen of 
jthe people he wanted — four wom- 
en and nine men — were sick in 
their hotel rooms. 

Naturally, he called the port au- 
thorities. After an examination, the 
M.D. who was brought in stated 
that all thirteen showed extreme 
weakness. They seemed to be, as 
he so succinctly put it, ”only mar- 
ginally alive.” 

The report evoked an alarm reac- 
tion from the Port Authority. The 
Director had visions of some kind 
of epidemic sweeping up from these 
dregs of people and decimating his 
little kingdom. 

He was still considering a course 
of action when reports from private 
doctors indicated that the illness, 
whatever it was, had affected a 
large number of affluent citizens 
of Spaceport in addition to the 
bums. 

The total in the final count came 
to a hundred and ninety-three per- 
sons sick with the same loss of en- 
ergy and near-death apathy.

XI 

A t some mind level, Hanardy be- 
came aware that Patricia Un- 
garn was falling to her death. 

To save her, he had to get en- 
ergy from somewhere. 

He knew immediately where the 
energy would have to come from. 

For a cosmic moment, as his som- 
nambulism was disrupted and re- 
placed by the dreaming state that 
precedes awakening, he was held 
by rigidities of his personality, 
Tliere was a split instant, then, 
as some aware part of him gazed in 
amazement and horror at a life- 
time of being a sloppy Joe. 

That one glance of kaleidoscopic 
insight was all that was necessary. 
The barriers went down. 

Time ceased. For him, all parti- 
cle flows ended. 

In that forever state, Hanardy 
was aware of himself as being at a 
location. 

Around him were 193 other lo- 
cations. He observed at once that 
thirteen of the locations were ex- 
tremely wavery. He immediately 
excluded the thirteen from his pur- 
pose. 

To the remaining 180 locations, 
he made a postulate. He postulated 
that the 180 would be glad to make 
immediate pa 5 rment. 

Eadi of the 180 thereupon will- 
ingly gave to Hanardy seven-tenths 
of all the available life-energy in 
their 180 locations. 



As that energy flowed to Hanardy, 
time resumed for him. 

^^he living miiverse that was 
Steve Hanardy expanded out 
to what appeared to be a great 
primeval dark. In that dark were 
blacker blobs, nine of them — the 
Dreeghs. At the very heart of the 
black excrescences ran a fine, 
wormlike thread of silvery brief- 
ness: the Dreegh disease, shining, 
twisting, ugly. 

As Hanardy noticed that utterly 
criminal distortion, he became 
aware of a red strekk in the sinis- 
ter silver. 

He thought, in immense aston- 
ishment, ”Why, that’s my blood 1” 

He realized, then, with profound 
interest that this was the blood 
the Dreeghs had taken from him 
Trfien they first arrived at the Un-? 
garn meteorite. 

They had given Sween most of 
it. But the others had each eager- 
ly taken a little of the fresh stuff 
for themselves. 

Hanardy realized that that was 
what the Great Galactic had no- 
ticed about him. He was a catalyst! 
In his presence by one means or 
another people got well ... in 
many ways. 

In a few days longer, his blood 
in them would enable the Dreeghs 
to cure their disease. 

The Dreeghs would discover the 
one belatedly — too late to change 
their forcing methods. 



THE PROXY INTELLIGENCE 



157 




For Hanardy, the scene altered. 

The nine black blobs yfete no 
longer shaped by their disease, as 
he saw them next. He found himself 
respecting the nine as members of 
the only race that had achieved 
immortality. 

The cure of them was important. 

Again, for Hanardy, there was a 
change. He was aware of long lines 
of energy that were streught and 
white flowing at him from some 
greater darkness beyond. In the 
near distance was a single point of 
light As his attention focused 
there, all the numerous lines, ex- 
cept from that light-point, van- 
ished. 

It occurred to Hanardy that that 
was the Dreegh ship and that, in 
relation to earth, it would eventu- 
ally be in a specific direction. The 
thin, thin, white line was like a 
pointer from the ship to him. Han- 
ardy glanced along that line. And 
because he was open — oh, so 
openl — he did the touching. Then 
he touched other places and 'did a 
balancing thing between them and 
the Dreegh ship. 

He oriented himself in space. 

Oriented it! 

As he completed that touching, he 
realized that the Dreegh ship was 
now slightly over six thousand 
light-years away. 

That was far enough, he decided. 

Having made that decision, he 
allowed particle flow to resume for 
the Dreeghs. And so — 



A s time began again, the Dreeghs 
found themselves in their own 
spaceship. There th^ were, all 
nine of them. They gazed uneasily 
at each other and then made a 
study of their surroundings. They 
saw unfamiliar star configurations. 
Their unhappiness grew. It was not 
a pleasant tMng to be lost in space, 
as they knew from previous experi- 
ence. 

After a while, when nothing 
further happened, it became ap- 
parent that — though they would 
probably never again be able to 
find the Earth’s solar system — 
they were safe . 

Pat’s first consciousness of 
change was that she was no longer 
falling. But no longer on Europa. 
As she caught her balance, she saw 
that she was in a familiar room. 

She shook her head to dear away 
the fuzziness from her eyes. And 
then she realized if was a room 
in the Ungam meteorite, her home. 
She heard a faint sound and swung 
about — and paused, balandng on 
one heel, as she saw her father. 

There was an expression of relief 
on his face. "You had me worried,” 
he said. "I’ve been here for more 
than an hour. My dear, all is well I 
Our screens are back to working; 
everything is the way it was . 
before. We’re safe.” 

"B-but,” said the girl, where’s 
Steve?” 

... It was earlier. Hanardy had 
the impression that he was remem- 



158 



IP 




bering a forgotten experience on the 
Ungarn meteorite — a time before 
the arrival of Sween-Madro and 
the second group of Dreeghs. 

The Great Galactic of that ear- 
lier time, he who had been William 
Leigh, bent over Hanardy where he 
lay on the floor. 

He said with a friendly, serious 
smile, ”You and that girl make 
quite a combination. You with so 
much owed to you, and she with 
that high ability for foolhardiness. 
We^re going to have another look 
at such energy debts. Maybe that 
way well find our salvation.” 

He broke off. "Steve, there are 
billions of open channels in the so- 
lar system. Awareness of the genius 
in them is the next step up for in- 
telligence. Because youVe had 
some feedback, if you take that to 
heart you might even get the girl.” 
Leigh’s words ended abruptly. 
For at that instant he touched the 
spaceman’s shoulder. 

The memory faded — 

XII 

t was several weeks later. 

On the desk of the Port Au- 
thority lay the report on the ill- 
ness which had suddenly affected 
193 persons. Among other data, the 
report stated: 

It develops that these people 
were all individuals who during the 
past fifteen years have taken ad^ 
vantage of a certain low^ I.Q. per* 



son named Steve Hanardy, As al- 
most everyone in Spaceport is 
aware, Hanardy — who shows many 
evidences of mental retardation — 
has year after year been by his 
own simple-minded connivance 
swindled out of his entire income 
from the space freighter, ECTON- 
66 (a type classification) — which 
he owns and operates. 

In this manner so much money 
has been filched from Hanardy 
that, first one person, then anoth- 
er, then many, set themselves up 
in business at their victimls ex- 
pense. And as soon as they were se- 
cure, each person in turn discarded 
the benefactor. For years now, 
ivhile one human leech after anoth- 
er climbed from poverty to afflu- 
ence, Hanardy himself has remain- 
ed at the lowest level. 

The afflicted are slowly recov- 
ering, and most are in a surprising- 
ly cheerful frame of mind. One 
man even said to me that he had a 
dream that he was paying a debt 
by becoming ill; and in the dream 
he was greatly relieved. 

There^s some story around that 
Hanardy has married the daughter 
of Professor Ungarn. But to accept 
that would be like believing that 
everything that has happened has 
been a mere background to a love 
story. 

I prefer to discount that rumor 
and ^prefer to say only that it is 
not known exactly wher& Hanardy 
is at present. END

Dear Editor: 

May I commend you on your pol- 
icy of printing a story by a beginning 
writer in each of your issues? This 
is a praiseworthy policy and no doubt 
encourages many aspiring authors to 
take a shot at science fiction. 

However, why not go another step 
forward and publish monthly a story 
with as little of the jargon of the 
medium as possible, and that little, 
clearly explained; terms defined so 
they could be understood by any 
person reading his first science-fiction 
story. SF has developed a vocabulary 
of scientific designations, quasi- 
scientific or plain imaginative; a 
lexicon all its own and as foreign as 
Greek to tyros — especially women. 
Let’s get down to bed-rock terms, or 
explained technical terms, in one 
masterpiece in each copy. New read- 
ers must learn to crawl, then walk, 
run or fly. — Hugh Allen, 2511 Na- 
dine St., Knoxville, Term. 37917.

Books in 1963. (Incidentally, Horn 
is not ^‘wrongly branded a criminal”, 
but is actually a hired assassin and 
is presented as such at the opening

I really think If and Galaxy are 
fine magazines; and with Galaxy 
going monthly, I hope we’ll see more 
features (“If — and When” is a good 
begiiming). How about a regular 
queries-and-answers column? I ^ow

some suggestions from other readers 
for or against some new features? —

Dear Editor: 

I have read and enjoyed If for 
umpteen years. Can anyone help me 
on this short story? Heinlein, 1 had 
thought. A spaceship lands on a plan- 
et with no life on it but trees which

human goofed them up. Also, who

be some reader can identify the other 
story; not by Heinlein, certainly. —

Dear Editor: 

There seems to be a rash of read- 
ers writing you asking for stories by 
their favorite authors. I might as well 
put in my two cents, too. How about 
some stories by Lin Carter, particu- 
larly in reference to his Thongor se- 
ries? By the way, has his column 
been dropped? And how about a few 
from Michael Moorcock, if he is 
writing any in the tradition of his 
Elric series? 

Yours is an excellent magazine. To 
have been awarded a Hugo twice 
means that you must be pleasing 
most everybody. But please, how 
about a good old sword-and-sorcery 
story once in a while for those of us 
who enjoy pure entertainment alone 
every now and then? — Larry Nea- 
gle, 4019-39th, Lubbock, Texas. 
•Most readers seem to object to 
having both science fiction and pure 
fantasy in the same magazine. But 
you’ll be happy to know that we are 
going to publish some good old 
sword-and-sorcery tales and other 
fantasy in a new magazine. Worlds 
of Fantasy, edited by Lester del Rey. 
It should be on the stands shortly 
after this issue of If, and it’s definite- 



ly pure entertainment. Lin Carter’s 
column, incidentally, was discon- 
tinued because it seemed that Lin had 
already covered the subject so thor- 
oughly that more would be nothing 
but repetition. — Editor.

Dear Editor: 

The Morrow cover for The Sleeper 
with Still Hands must surely be one 
of the all-time greats — as art, rather 
than illustration. 

May I suggest you obtain more 
Larry Niven stories, more long Zel- 
azny, more Delany and — more Gree 
stories! The Gree novelettes show the 
hand of a fine, first-class craftsman; 
we need more like these — nothing 
tremendous about them, but sheer 
fun. These stories and others like 
them are really what form the foun- 
dation of SF. 

How about some stories of com- 
puters? Some that don’t show them 
as harbingers of doom for the human 
race. Stories like D. F. Jones’s Colos- 
sus make good reading, but for one 
whose occupation lies in the data- 
processing field, they are likely some- 
times to make one feel like Benedict 
Arnold. 

Perhaps some of your readers can 
help me. I’m looking for a story that 
appeared, I believe, in Galaxy around 
1960. It had the flavor of a Poul 
Anderson. It involved a spiderlike 
race that destroyed Earth and almost 
all of its human inhabitants, save for 
a few wanderers. They returned to 
Earth and, finding it a rather un- 
healthy place, fled; they intended to 
revive the human race, there being 
just one catch: Being an all male 
crew, they had no Eve. I never did 
finish it. If any of your readers have

Dear Editor: 

1 have been a firm science-fiction 
fan since 1 was 6. During that time 
I have never met anyone who was 
really interested in SF. People have 
been giving me an inferiority com- 
plex because they feel that no one 
who has any inteljjgence reads science 
fiction. 1 realize that is not the case. 
But • • • 

By and far, my biggest complaint 
is that 1 have no one to discuss 



science fiction with on any level. One 
of my friends states that she likes it 
but ^e never gets past Star Trek. 
There are probably many people who 
have the same problem as 1. Isn’t 
there some way you or the rest of 
those of First Fandom could do 
to help us? 

Why don’t you start a pen-pal club 
for science-fiction fans? It would not 
have to be a regular club with dues 
and all; people could merely send in 
a self-addressed envelope and a card 
with name, address and possibly age. 
Then the cards could be placed in 
another’s envelope and be exchanged. 
I feel that people who have an in- 
terest in SF should have some way 
of personal communication. — Ma^
