about what to do about what no longer the way to get

ahead. Most of the reason, 
though, is the simple fact that 
humanity cannot long con- 
tinue halfway through the nu- 
clear knothole. We have to 
find a way to survive or we 
won’t survive, and that is the 
stark and simple truth. 

The picture of a widely as- 
sorted group of bigbrains in a 
wide-spectrum cranium can- 
tata makes one think (of all 
things) of science fiction Con- 
ferences and Conventions. 
Bearing firmly in mind the re- 
nowned Sturgeon Revelation 
(“Ninety percent of sf is un- 
adulterated c r u d, because 
ninety percent of everything 
is unadulterated crud”) the 
fact remains that sf people — 
writers, readers, editors, but 
especially readers — have cer- 
tain advantages when it comes 
to instituting searches for an- 
swers. The attache-case crowd 
sometimes refer to brainstorm 
sessions as “blue-sky” think- 
ing. They mean, we think, “un- 
limited”; but from its earliest 
infancy, sf was never bound by 
so close a fence as the sky. 
The nearby grounds have been 
combed and curried for an 
answer, and it obviously isn’t 
anywhere within conventional 
thinking. If one can be 
thought up, it’s going to have 
to come from pretty far out. 
There’s a small but live chance 
that someone as screwball as 
thee and me might find it.

preliminary thinking. If we 
start with as many cockeyed 
ideas as possible, each spark- 
ing the next, who knows? And 
if The, Answer emerged, who’d 
listen to us? 

Just to start some fights, 
let’s begin with the old idea 
that a person can be put into 
a state of suspended anima- 
tion in the event that his dis- 
ease is incurable, so that in a 
year or five or a hundred he 
can be revived and cured by a 
medical science which has at 
last caught up with his afflic- 
tion. Now: we put everybody 
in the whole damn world in 
suspended animation but for, 
say, the Big Bend Science 
Fiction Club, and let them fig- 
ure it out for us, to wake us 
up if they find an answer, or 
if they don’t, well, don’t. 

We are by no means sug- 
gesting that sf club meetings. 
Conferences and Conventions 
drop everything from hooch 
to Hugo in favor of grim dis- 
cussions on “After Mankind — 
What?” 

It’s just that it occurs to us 
that if there is an Answer, the 
chances are it’ll come from 
someone whose mind recog- 
nizes no horizons whatever, 
who knows a little something 
about logical thinking, and 
who knows where he can find 
a bunch of people who won’t 
tap their foreheads at a some- 
what far-out idea.

IF • Short Story 


One little village couldn’t have a monopoly on all the 

bad breaks in the world. 
BY JIM HARMON They did, though! 



DANGEROUS 


QUARRY 


T HEY say automation 
makes jobs, especially if 
“they” are trying to keep their 
own job of selling automation 
machines. I know the Actuar- 
vac made one purple passion 
of a job for me, the unpleas- 
antly fatal results of which 
are still lingering with me. 

Thad McCain, my boss at 
Manhattan-Universal Insur- 
ance, beamed over the sprawl- 
ing automatic brain’s silver 
gauges and plastic toggles as 
proudly as if he had just per- 
sonally gave birth to it. “This 
will simplify your job to the 
point of a pleasant diversion, 
Madison.” 

“Are you going to keep pay- 
ing me for staying with my 
little hobby?” I asked, suspi- 
ciously eyeing my chrome 
competitor. 

“The Actuarvac poses no 
threat to your career. It will 


merely keep you from flying 
off on wild-goose chases. It 
will unvaryingly separate 
from the vast body of legiti- 
mate claims the phony ones 
they try to spike us for. Then 
all that remains is for you to 
gather the accessory details, 
the evidence to jail our erring 
customers.” 

“Fine,” I said. I didn’t both- 
er to inform him that that was 
all my job had ever been. 

McCain shuffled his cards. 
They were cards for the ma- 
chine, listing new individual 
claims on company policies. 
Since the two-month-old ma- 
chine was literate and could 
read typewriting, the cards 
weren’t coded or punched. He 
read the top one. “Now this, 
for instance. No adjuster need 
investigate this accident. The 
circumstances obviously are 
such that no false claim could 

37 



be filed. Of course, the brain 
will make an unfailing analy- 
sis of all the factors involved 
and clear the claim automat- 
ically and officially/’ 

McCain threaded the single 
card into the slot for an ex- 
ample to me. He then flicked 
the switch and we stood there 
watching the monster rumi- 
nate thoughtfully. It finally 
rang a bell and spit the card 
back at Manhattan-Universal’s 
top junior vice-president. 

He took it like a man. 

“That’s what the machine is 
feu*/’ he said philosophically. 
‘•' 7 "o detect human error. 
Hmm. What kind of a shove 
co you get out of this?” 

He handed me the rejected 
c^aim card. I took it, finding a 
new, neatly typed notation on 
it. It said: 

t 

Investigate the Ozark village of 
G -anile City. 

“You want me to project it 
in a movie theater and see how 
it stands it all alone in the 
dark?” I asked. 

“Just circle up the wagon 
train and see how the Indians 
fall/’ McCain said anxiously. 

“It’s too general. What does 
the nickel-brained machine 
mean by investigating a whole 
town?. I don’t knew if it has 
crooked politics, a polygamy 
colony or a hideout for sup- 
posedly deported gangsters. I 
don’t care much either. It’s 
not my business. How could a 
whole town be filing false 
life and accident claims?” 
“Find that. out,”. he said, “I 
30 


trust the machine. There have 
been cases of mass collusion 
before. Until you get back, we 
are making no more settle- 
ments with that settlement.” 

ESEARCH. To a writer 
that generally means le- 
gally permissible plagiarism. 
For an ihs.urance adjuster* it 
means earnest work. 

Before I headed for the 
hills, or the Ozark Mountains, 
I walked a few hundred feet 
down the hall and into the 
manual record files. The brain 
abstracted from empirical 
data but before I planed out 
to Granite City I had to find 
the basis for a few practical, 
nasty suspicions. 

Four hours of flipping 
switches and looking at micro- 
film projections while a 
tawny redhead in a triangular 
fronted uniform carried me 
reels to order gave me only 
two ideas. Neither was very 
original. The one that con- 
cerned business was that the 
whole village of Granite City 
must be accident-prone. 

I rejected that one almost 
immediately. While an acci- 
dent-prone was in himself a 
statistical anomaly, the idea of 
a whole town of them gath- 
ered together stretched the 
fabric of reality to the point 
where even an invisible re- 
weaver couldn’t help it. 

There was an explanation 
for the recent rise in the acci- 
dent rate down there. The 
rock quarry there had gone 
into high-level . operation. I 

by Jim Harmon 




knew why from the floor, 
walls, ceiling border, table 
trimmings in the records 
room. They were all granite. 
The boom in granite for inte- 
rior and exterior decoration 
eclipsed earlier periods of 
oak, plastics, wrought iron 
and baked clay completely. 
The distinctive grade of gran- 
ite from Granite City was be- 
ing put into use all over the 
planet and in the Officer's 
Clubs on the Moon and Mars. 

Yet the rise in accident, 
compared to the rise in pro- 
duction, was out of all propor- 
tion. 

Furthermore, the work at 
the quarry could hardly ex- 
plain the excessive accident 
reports we had had from the 
village as far back as our rec- 
ords went. 

We had paid off on most of 
the claims since they seemed 
irrefutably genuine. All were 
complete with eye-witness re- 
ports and authenticated cir- 
cumstances. 

There was one odd note in 
the melodic scheme: We had 
never had a claim for any kind 
of automobile accident from 
Granite City. 

I shut off the projector. 

It may be best to keep an 
open mind, but I have found 
in practice that you have to 
have some kind of working 
theory which you must pro- 
ceed to prove is either right or 
wrong. 

Tentatively, I decided that 
for generations the citizens of 
Granite City had been in an 
DANGEROUS QUARRY 


organized conspiracy to de- 
fraud Manhattan-Universal 
and its predecessors of hun- 
dreds upon hundreds of thou- 
sands of dollars in false acci- 
dent claims. 

Maybe they made their 
whole livelihood off us before 
the quarry opened up. 

I used my pocket innercom 
and had my secretary get me 
a plane reservation and a gun. 

After so many profitable 
decades, Granite City wasn't 
going to take kindly to my 
spoil-sport interference. 

T HE Absinthe Flight to 
Springfield was jolly and 
relatively fast. Despite head- 
winds we managed Mach 1.6 
most of the way. My particu- 
lar stewardess was a blonde, 
majoring in Video Psycho- 
therapy in her night courses. 
I didn’t have much time to get 
acquainted or more than hear 
the outline of her thesis on the 
guilt purgings effected by 
The Life and Legend of Gary 
Cooper. The paunchy busi- 
nessman in the next lounge 
was already nibbling the ear 
of his red-haired hostess. He 
was the type of razorback who 
took the girls for granted and 
aimed to get his money’s 
worth. I gave Helen, the 
blonde, a kiss on the cheek 
and began flipping through 
the facsimiles in my briefcase 
as we chute-braked for a land- 
ing at the Greater Ozarks. 

It took me a full five min- 
utes to find out that I 
couldn’t take a copter to Gran- 

39 



ite City. Something about 
downdrafts in the mountains. 

Since that put me back in 
the days of horsepower, I 
trotted over to the automobile 
rental and hired a few hun- 
dred of them under the hood 
of a Rolls. That was about the 
only brand of car that fit me. 
I hadn't been able to get my 
legs into any ocher foreign 
car since I was fifteen, and I 
have steadfastly refused to 
enter an American model 
since they all sold out their 
birthrights as passenger cars 
and went over to the tractor- 
trailer combinations they used 
only for cargo trucks when I 
was a boy. Dragging around 
thirty feet of car is sheer non- 
sense, even for prestige. 

It was a tiresome fifty-mile 
drive, on manual all the way 
after I left the radar-channel 
area of the city. Up and down, 
slowing for curves, flipping 
into second for the hills. 

The whole trip hardly 
seemed worth it when I saw 
the cluster of painted frame 
buildings that was Granite 
City. They looked like a tum- 
ble of dingy building blocks 
tossed in front of a rolled-up 
indigo sports shirt. That was 
Granite Mountain in the near 
foreground. But I remembered 
that over the course of some 
forty years the people in 
these few little stacks of lum- 
ber had taken Manhattan- 
Universal for three quarters 
of a megabuck. 

I turned off onto the gravel 
road, spraying my fenders 

40 


with a hail of a racket. Then I 
stepped down hard on my 
brakes, bracing myself to keep 
from going through the wind- 
screen. I had almost side- 
swiped an old man sitting at 
the side of the road, huddled 
in his dusty rags. 

“Are you okay?” I yelled, 
thumbing down the window. 

“I've suffered no harm at 
your hands — or your wheels, 
sir. But I could use some 
help,” the old man said. 
“Could I trouble you for a lift 
when you leave town?” 

I wasn't too sure about that. 
Most of these guys who are on 
the hobo circuit talking like 
they owned some letters to 
their names besides their ini- 
tials belonged to some cult or 
other. I try to be as tolerant 
as I can, and some of my best 
friends are thugs, but I don't 
want to drive with them down 
lonely mountain roads. 

“We’ll see what we can 
work out,” I said. “Right now 
can you tell me where I can 
find Marshal Thompson?” 

“I can,” he said. “But you 
will have to walk there.” 

“Okay. It shouldn't be much 
of a walk in Granite City.” 

“It’s the house at the end of 

the street.” 

“It is,” I said. “Why 
shouldn’t I drive up there? 
The street's open.” 

The old man stared at me 
with red-shot eyes. “Marshal 
Thompson doesn't like people 
to run automobiles on the 
streets of Granite City.” 

“So I’ll just lock the car up 

by Jim Harmon 



and walk over there. I couldn’t 
go getting tire tracks all over 
your clean streets.” 

The old man watched as I 
climbed down and locked up 
the Rolls. 

“You would probably get 
killed if you did run the car 
here, you know,” he said con- 
versationally. 

“Well,” I said, “I’ll be get- 
ting along.” I tried to walk 
sideways so I could keep an 
eye on him. 

“Come back,” he said, as if 
he had doubts. 

The signs of a menacing 
conspiracy were growing 
stronger, I felt. I had my au- 
tomatic inside my shirt, but I 
decided I might need a less 
lethal means of expression. 
Without breaking stride, I 
scooped up a baseball-size 
hunk of bluish rock from the 
road and slipped it into my 
small change pocket. 

I have made smarter moves 
in my time. 

As I approached the house 
at the end of the lane, I saw it 
was about the worse construc- 
tion job I had seen in my life. 
It looked as architecturally 
secure as a four-year-old’s 
drawing of his home. The an- 
gles were measurably out of 
line. Around every nail head 
were two nails bent out of 
shape and hammered down, 
and a couple of dozen welts 
in the siding where the ham- 
mer had missed any nail. The 
paint job was spotty and 
streaked. Half the panes in 
the windows were cracked. I 
DANGEROUS QUARRY 


fought down the dust in my 
nose, afraid of the conse- 
quences of a sneeze to the 
place. 

My toe scuffed the top 
porch step and I nearly 
crashed face first into the 
front door. I had been too 
busy looking at the house, I 
decided. I knocked. 

Moments later, the door 

opened. 

The lean-faced man who 
greeted me had his cheeks 
crisscrossed with razor nicks 
and his shirt on wrong side 
out. But his eyes were bright 
and sparrow alert. 

“Are you Mr. Marshal 
Thompson, the agent for Man- 
hattan-Universal Insurance ?” 
I put to him. 

“I’m the marshal, name of 
Thompson. But you ain’t the 
first to take my title for my 
Christian name. You from the 
company?” 

“Yes,” I said. “Were you 
expecting me?” 

Thompson nodded. “Por 
forty-one years.” 

T hompson served the 

coffee in the chipped cups, 
favoring only slightly his 
burned fingers. 

o _ 

Catching the direction of 
my glance, he said, “Company 
is worth a few scalds, Mr. 
Madison.” 

I accepted the steaming cup 
and somehow it very nearly 
slipped out of my hands. I 
made a last microsecond re- 
trieve. 

The marshal nodded 

41 



thoughtfully. “ You're new 
here.” 

“First time,” I said, sipping 
coffee. It was awful. He must 
have made a mistake and put 
salt into it instead of sugar. 

“You think the claims I’ve 
been filing for my people are 
false?” 

“The home office has some 
suspicions of that,” I admit- 
ted. 

“I don't blame them, but 
they ain't. Look, the company 
gambles on luck, doesn't it?” 

“No. It works on percent- 
ages calculated from past ex- 
perience.” 

“But I mean it knows that 
there will be, say, a hundred 
fatal car crashes in a day. But 
it doesn't know if maybe nine- 
ty of them will be in Iowa and 
only ten in the rest of the 
country.” 

“There's something to that. 
We call it probability, not 
luck.” 

“Well, probability says that 
more accidents are going to 
occur in Granite City than 
anywhere else in the country, 
per capita.” 

I shook my head at Thomp- 
son. “That’s hot probability. 
Theoretically, anything can 
happen but I don’t — I can't — 
believe that in this town eve- 
rybody has chanced to be an 
accident prone. Some other 
factor is operating. You are 
all deliberately faking these 
falls and fires — ” 

“We're not,” Thompson 
snapped. 

“Or else something is caus- 

42 


in(| you to have this trouble. 
Maybe the whole town is a 
bunch of dope addicts. May- 
be you grow your own mescal- 
in or marijuana; it's happened 
before.” 

Thompson laughed. 

“Whatever is going on, I'm 
going to find it out. I don't 
care what you do, but if I can 
find a greater risk here and 
prove it, the Commission will 
let us up our rates for this 
town. Probably beyond the 
capacity of these people, I'm 
afraid.” 

“That would be a real trag- 
edy, Mr. Madison. Insurance 
is vital to this town. Nobody 
could survive a year here 
without insurance. People pay 
me for their premiums before 
they pay their grocery bills.” 

I shrugged, sorrier than I 
could let on. “I won't be able 
to pay for my own groceries, 
marshal, if I don't do the kind 
of job the company expects. 
I’m going to snoop around.” 

“All right,” he said grudg- 
ingly, ' but you’ll have to do 
it on foot.” 

“Yes, I understood you 
didn’t like cars on your 
streets. At least not the cars 
of outsiders.” 

“That doesn’t have anything 
to do with it. Nobody in Gran- 
ite City owns a car. It would 
be suicide for anybody to 
drive a car, same as it would 
be to have a gas or oil stove, 
instead of coal, or to own a 
bathtub.” 

I took a deep breath. 

“Showers,” Thompson said. 

by Jim Harmon 



“With nonskid mats and hand- 
rails.” 

I shook hands with him. 
“You’ve been a great help.” 

“Four o’clock,” he said. 
“Roads are treacherous at 
night.” 

“There’s always a dawn.” 

Thompson met my eyes. 
“That’s not quite hew we look 
at it here.” 

II 

HE quarry was a mess. 

I couldn’t see any in the 
way they sliced the granite 
out of the mountain. The idea 
of a four-year-old — a four- 
year-old moron — going after 
a mound of raspberry ice 
cream kept turning up in my 
mind as I walked around. 

The workmen were pone: it 

7 

was after five local time. But 
here and there I saw traces 
of them. Some of them were 
sandwich wrappers and ciga- 
rette stubs, but most of the 
traces were smears of blood. 
Blood streaked across sharp 
rocks, blood oozing from 
beneath heavy rocks, blood 
smeared on the handles and 
working surfaces of sledge 
hammers and tools. The place 
was as gory as a battlefield. 

“What are you looking for, 
bud ?” 

The low, level snarl had 
come from a burly character 
in a syn-leather jacket and 
narrow-brimmed Stetson. 

“The reason you have so 
many accidents here,” I said 
frankly. “I’m from the insur- 
DANGEROUS QUARRY 


ance company. Name’s Madi- 
son.” 

“Yeah, I know.” 

I had supposed he would. 
“I’m Kelvin, the foreman 
here,” the big man told me, 
extending a ham of a fist to 
be shook. “Outside, doing my 
Army time, I noticed that 
most people don’t have as 
many slipups as we do here. 
Ne ver could figure it out.” 
“This rock is part of it — ” 
“What do you mean by 
that !” Kelvin demanded sav- 
agely. 

“I mean the way you work 
it. No system to it. No strati- 
fication, no plateau work. 

“Listen, Madison, don’t talk 
about what you don’t know 
anything about. The stuff in 
these walls isn’t just rock ; it 
isn’t even plain granite. Gran- 
ite City exports some of the 
finest grade of the stone in 
the world. And it’s used all 
over the world. We aren't 
just a bunch of meatheaded 
ditch diggers — we are crafts- 
men. V/c have to figure a dif- 
ferent way of getting out eve- 
ry piece of stone.” 

“It’s too bad.” 

“What’s too bad?” 

“That you chose the wrong 
way so often,” I said. 

Kelvin breathed a virile 
grade of tobacco into my face. 
“Listen, Madison, we have 
been working this quarry for 
generations, sometimes more 
of us working than other 
times. Today most of us are 
working getting' the stone out. 
That’s the way we like it. We 




don’t want any outsider com- 
ing in and interfering with 
that.” 

"If this quarry has anything 
to do with defrauding Man- 
hattan-Universal, I can tell 
you that I will do something 
about that!” 

As soon as my teeth clicked 
back together, the sickening 
feeling hit me that I shouldn’t 
have said that. 

T HE general store was 
called a supermarket, but 
it wasn’t particularly superior. 

I took a seat at the soda 
fountain and took a beer, po- 
litely declining the teen-age 
clerk’s offer of a shot of white 
lightning from the Pepsi-Cola 
fountain syrup jug for a quar- 
ter. 

Behind me were three res- 
taurant tables and one soli- 
tary red-upholstered booth. 
Two men somewhere between 
forty and sixty sat at the near- 
est table playing twenty-one. 

Over the foam of my stein 
I saw the old man I had almost 
run down in the road. He 
marched through the two- 
thirds of the building com- 
posed of rows of can goods 
and approached the fat man at 
the cash register. 

"Hello, Professor,” the fat 
man said. "What can we do 
for you?” 

"I’d like to mail a letter,” 
he said in an urgent voice. 

"Sure, Professor, I’ll send it 
right off on the facsimile ma- 
chine as soon as I get a free 
moment.” 

44 


"You’re sure you can send 
it? Right away?” 

"Positive. Ten cents, Pro- 
fessor.” 

The professor fumbled in 
his pants’ pocket and fished 
out a dime. He fingered it 
thoughtfully. 

"I suppose the letter can 
wait,” he said resignedly. "I 
believe I will buy a pair of 
doughnuts, Mr. Haskel.” 

"Why not get a hamburger, 
Professor? Special sale today. 
Only a dime. And since you’re 
such a good customer I’ll 
throw in a cup of coffee and 
the two sinkers for nothing.” 

"That’s — kind of you,” the 
old man said awkwardly. 

Haskel shrugged. "A man 
has to eat.” 

The man called "the pro- 
fessor” came over and sat 
down two stools away, ignor- 
ing me. The clerk dialed his 
hamburger and served it. 

I stayed with my beer and 
my thoughts. 

More and more, I was com- 
ing to believe that Granite 
City wasn’t a job for an in- 
vestigative adjuster like my- 
self but a psychological ad- 
juster. Crime is a structural 
flaw in a community, yes. But 
when the whole society is 
criminal, distorted, you can’t 
isolate the flaw. The whole 
village was meat for a sociolo- 
gist; let him figure out why 
otherwise decent citizens felt 
secure in conspiracy to de- 
fraud an honored corporation. 

I' didn’t feel that I was 
licked or that the trip had 

by Jim Harmon 



been a failure. I had merely 
established to my intuitive 
satisfaction that the job was 
not in my field. 

I glanced at the old man. 
The proprietor of the store 
knew him and evidently 
thought him harmless enough 
to feed. 

“I think I can make it down 
the mountain before dark, Old 
Timer/’ I called over to him. 
“You can come along if you 
like.” 

The acne-faced kid behind 
the counter stared at me. I 
looked over and caught the 
bright little eyes of Haskel, 
the proprietor, too. Finally, 
the old professor turned on 
his stool, his face pale and 
his eyes sad and resigned. 

“I doubt very much if ei- 
ther of us will be leaving, Mr. 
Madison,” he said. “Now.” 

I took my beer and the pro- 
fessor his coffee over to the 
single booth. We looked at 
each other across the shiny 
table and our beverage con- 
tainers. 

“I am Doctor Arnold Par- 
nell of Duke University,” the 
professor said. “I left on my 
sabbatical five months ago. I 
have been here ever since.” 

I looked at his clothes. “You 
must not have been very well 
fixed for a year’s vacation, 
Professor.” 

“I,” he said, “have enough 
traveler’s checks with me to 
paper a washroom. Nobody in 
this town will cash them for 
me. 

DANGEROUS QUARRY 


“I can understand why you 
want to go somewhere where 
people are more trusting in 
that case.” 

“They know the checks are 
good. It’s me they refuse to 
trust to leave this place. They 
think they can’t let me g°” 

“I don’t see any shackles on 
you,” I remarked. 

“Just because you can’t see 
them,” he growled, “doesn’t 
mean they aren’t there. Mar- 
shal Thompson has the only 
telephone in the village. He 
has politely refused to let me 
use it. I’m a suspicious and 
undesirable character; he’s 
under no obligation to give me 
telephone privileges, he says. 
Haskel has the Post Office 
concession — the Telefax out- 
fit behind the money box over 
there. He takes my letters but 
I never see him send them off. 
And I never get a reply.” 

“Unfriendly of them,” I 
said conservatively. “But how 
can they stop you from pack- 
ing your dental floss and cut- 
ting out?” 

“Haskel has the only motor 
vehicle in town — a half-ton 
pick-up, a minuscule contriv- 
ance less than the size of a 
passenger car. He makes about 
one trip a week down into the 
city for supplies and package 
mail. He’s been the only one 
in or out of Granite City for 
five months.” 

It seemed incredible — more 
than that, unlikely, to me. 
“How about the granite itself? 
How do they ship it out?” 

“It’s an artificial demand 

45 



product, like diamonds/' Pro- 
fessor Parnell said. "They 
stockpile it and once a year 
the executive offices for the 
company back in Nashville 
runs in a portable monorail 
railroad up the side of the 
mountain to take it out. That 
won’t be for another four 
months, as nearly as I can find 
out. I may not last that long." 

"How are you living?" I 
asked. "If they won’t take 
your checks — " 

"I do odd jobs for people. 
They feed me, give me a little 
money sometimes." 

"I can see why you want to 
ride out with me," I said. 
"Haven’t you ever thought of 
just walking out?" 

"Fifty miles down a steep 
mountain road? I’m an old 
man, Mr. Madison, and I’ve 
gotten even older since I came 
to Granite City." 

I nodded. "You have any pa- 
pers, any identification, to 
back this up?" 

Wordlessly, he handed over 
his billfold, letters, enough 
identification to have satisfied 
Allen Pinkerton or John Ed- 
gar Hoover. 

"Okay," I drawled. "I’ll ac- 
cept your story for the mo- 
ment. Now answer me the big 
query: Why are the good peo- 
ple of Granite City doing this 
to you? By any chance, you 
wouldn’t happen to know of a 
mass fraud they are perpetrat- 
ing on Manhattan-Universal?" 

"I know nothing of their 
ethical standards," Parnell 
said, "but I do know that they 
46 


are absolutely subhuman !’’ 

"I admit I have met like- 
lier groups of human beings 
in my time." 

"No, understand me. These 
people are literally subhuman 
— they are inferior to other 
human beings." 

"Look, I know the Klan is a 
growing organization but I 
can’t go along with you." 

"Madison, understand me, I 
insist. Ethnologically speak- 
ing, it is well known that cer- 
tain tribes suffer certain de- 
ficiencies due to diet, climate, 
et cetera. Some can’t run, sing, 
use mathematics. The people 
of Granite City have the most 
unusual deficency on record, 
I admit. Their psionic senses 
have been impaired. They are 
completely devoid of any use 
of telepathy, precognition, 
telekinesis." 

4£OECAUSE they aren’t su- 
" permen, that doesn’t 
mean that they are submen," I 
protested. "I don’t have any 
psionic abilities either." 

"But you do!" Parnell said 
earnestly. "Everybody has 
some psionics ability, but we 
don’t realize it. We don’t have 
the fabulous abilities of a few 
recorded cases of supermen, 
but we have some, a trace. 
Granite City citizens have no 
psionic ability whatsoever, not 
even the little that you and I 
and the rest of the world 
have !" 

"You said you were Duke 
University, didn’t you?" I 
mused* "Maybe you know 

by Jim Harmon 



what you are talking about; 
I've never been sure. But these 
people can’t suffer very much 
from their lack of what you 
call psi ability.” 

”1 tell you they do,” he said 
hoarsely. “We never realize it 
but we all have some power of 
precognition. If we didn’t, we 
would have a hundred acci- 
dents a day — just as these peo- 
ple do. They can’t foresee the 
bump in the road the way we 
can, or that that particular 
match will flare a little higher 
and burn their fingers. There 
are other things, as well. 
You’ll find it is almost impos- 
sible to carry on a lengthy 
conversation with any of them 
— they have no telepathic abil- 
ity, no matter how slight, to 
see through the semantic bar- 
rier. None of them can play 
ball. They don’t have the un- 
conscious psionic ability to in- 
fluence the ball in flight. All 
of us can do that, even if the 
case of a ‘Poltergeist’ who 
can lift objects is rare.” 

“Professor, you mean these 
people are holding you here 
simply so you won’t go out 
and tell the rest of the world 
that they are submen?” 

“They don’t want the world 
to know why they are psionic- 
ally subnormal,” he said crisp- 
ly. “It’s the granite ! I don’t 
understand why myself. I’m 
not a physicist or a biologist. 
But for some reason the heavy 
concentration and particular 
pattern of the radioactive ra- 
diation in its matrix is respon- 
sible for both inhibiting the 
DANGEROUS QUARRY 


genes that transmit psi pow- 
ers from generation to genera- 
tion and affecting those abil- 
ities in the present generation. 
A kind of psionic sterility.” 

“How do you know this?” 

“We haven’t the time for all 
that. But think about it. What 
else could it be? It’s that gran- 
ite that they are shipping all 
over the world, spreading the 
contamination. I want to stop 
that contamination. To the 
people of Granite City that 
means ruining their only in- 
dustry, putting them all out 
of work. They are used to this 
psionic sterility; they don’t 
see anything so bad about it. 
Besides, like everybody else, 
they have some doubts that 
there really are such things as 
telepathy and the rest to be 
affected.” 

“Frankly,” I said, hedging 
only a little, “I don’t know 
what to make of your story. 
This is something to be de- 
cided bv somebody infallible 
— like the Pope or the Presi- 
dent or Board Chairman of 
Manhattan-Universal. But the 
first thing to do is get you 
out of here. We had better get 
back to my car. I’ve got good 
lights to get down the moun- 
tain.” 

Parnell jumped up eagerly, 
and brushed over his china 
mug, staining the tabletop 
with brown caffeine. 

“Sorry,” he said. “I should 
have been precogniz;apt of 
that. I try to stay away from 
the rock as much as, possible, 
but it’s getting to me.” 

47 



I should have remembered 
something then. But, natural- 
ly, I didn’t. 

I T was the time when you 
could argue about whether 
it was twilight or night. In 
the deep dusk, the Rolls 
looked to be a horror-flicker 
giant bug. I fumbled for the 
keys. Then the old man made 
me break stride by digging 
narrow fingers into my bicep. 

Marshal Thompson and the 
bulky quarry foreman, Kelvin, 
stepped out of the shadow of 
the car. 

“First, throw away that gun 
of yours, Mr. Madison,” the 
marshal said. 

I looked at his old pistol 
that must have used old pow- 
der cartridges, instead of liq- 
uid propellants, and forked 
out my Smith & Wesson with 
two fingers, letting it plop at 
my feet. 

“I’m afraid we can’t let you 
spread the professor’s lies, 
Mr. Madison,” Thompson said. 

“You planning on killing 
me?” I asked with admirable 
restraint. 

“I hope not. You can have 
the run of the town, like the 
professor. I’ll tell your com- 
pany you are making a thor- 
ough investigation. Then may- 
be in a few weeks or months I 
can arrange so it looks like 
you were killed — someplace 
outside.” 

“We don’t aim to let any 
crazy fanatic like Parnell ruin 
our business, our whole town,” 
Kelvin interjected bitterly, 

48 


I took a pause to make ab- 
stractions on the situation. I 
glanced at the little man at 
my right. “Parnell, my car is 
our only chance of getting out 
of here. If they stop us from 
getting in that car, v/e’ll be 
bums here on town charity for 
the rest of our lives.” 

“No!” Parnell gave a terrier 
yell and charged the gun in 
the old marshal’s hand. 

It seemed as if it would take 
me too long to recover my gun 
from the dirt, but almost in- 
stinctively I felt the rock in 
the pocket of my pants. 

I scooped out the sample of 
granite and heaved it at the 
head of the old cop. But my 
control seemed completely 
shot. It missed the old man’s 
head with an appalling gap 
and hit the roof of the Rolls. 

Fortunately, the granite ra- 
diations didn’t influence non- 
human-o r i e n t e d factors of 
chance. The stone bounced off 
the car and struck the mar- 
shal’s gun hand. 

Thompson dropped his gun 
and I reached for mine in the 
dust, vaguely aware of Kelvin 
pumping toward me. 

I straightened up. He led 
with his right, of all damn 
things. I blocked it with my 
gun hand and let him have my 
left in the midst of his solar 
plexus. He crumpled prettier 
than a paper doll. 

When the dust cleared, Pro- 
fessor Parnell was sitting on 
Thompson’s chest. 

“Hooray,” I said, “for our 
side.” 


by Jim Harmon 



T HE people had made one 
mistake. They thought peo- 
ple would believe us. 

Parnell and I broke the 
story to some newspaper 
friends of mine. They gave it 
a play in the mistaken belief 
the professor and I were start- 
ing our own cult, and the 
equal-time law is firm. But 
nobody paid any more atten- 
tion to us than to the Hedon- 
ists, the Klan, the Soft-shelled 
Baptists or the Reformed Ag- 
nostics. 

I tried to get Thad McCain 
to realize all the money this 
cursed granite was costing us 
in accident claims, but it 
wasn’t easy. Manhattan-Uni- 
versal owned stock in Granite 
City Products, Inc. And we 
had spent a quarter of a mega- 
buck modernizing our offices 
with granite only months be- 
fore. 

“McCain,” I said earnestly, 
“will you just let me feed the 
new data we’ve got from Par- 
nell into the Actuarvac? It’s 
infallible. See what it says.” 
“Very well,” McCain said 
with a sigh. He let me feed 
the big brain the hypothesis I 
had got from Parnell. It chat- 
tered to itself for some min- 
utes and at last flipped a card 
into the slot. 

I dug the pasteboard out 
and read it. It said: 

No such place as Granite City 
exists. 

“The rock has got to the ma- 
chine,” I screamed. “Chief, 

DANGEROUS QUARRY 


this brain is stoned. It’s made 
a mistake. We know there is 
such a place.” 

“Nonsense, my boy,” Mc- 
Cain said in a fatherly way. 
“The Actuarvac merely means 
that no such place as you erro- 
neously described could pos- 
sibly exist. Why don’t you try 
one of our Hedonist revival 
meetings tonight?” 

T HINGS have got steadily 
worse since then. 

So far nobody has made the 
big mistake of dropping an 
H-bomb on anyone, but that’s 
probably because all the gov- 
ernments made so many small- 
er mistakes the people made 
the mistake (or was it?) of 
kicking them out for almost 
absolute anarchy. But the in- 
dividuals are doing worse than 
the governments. .if that’s 
possible. 

People have given up going 
anywhere except by foot, for 
the most part. 

Granite City granite is still 
as widely disbursed and al- 
most as highly prized as 
South African diamonds. 

I hope we will find some 
way out of our current world 
crisis, although I can’t imag- 
ine what it will be. 

Meanwhile, I hope you will 
excuse any typographical er- 
rors. It seems as if I just can’t 
seem to hit the right keys on 
my typewriter any more, as 
my — and all of our — psionic 
sterility increases. 

I ask hugh — wear wall it 
owl end? END

ALEXANDER 


GRAHAM BELL 


AND ME 


BY THEODORE STURGEON 

S OME years ago — in the fall 
of 1944, to be exact — your 
reporter had one of those (in 
the biographical sense) epoch- 
al encounters after which, like 
the first day in high school, 
the first really bad storm at 
sea, the first story check, 
one’s life is never auite the 
same. I met a man called Will 
Jenkms, and he invited me 
out to his home. 

You know him as Murray 
Leinster. Other readers have 
known him by other names, 
for a long, long time. (I re- 
member his telling me that he 
was the only ardent reader of 
the Rover Boys who ever 
grew up to become their fa- 
ther.) Short, quiet, soft-spo- 
ken, with manners just short 
of the affectation called 
‘'courtly,’* he concealed, at the 
outset, his two secret weap- 
ons: a rock-hard set of high 


ILLUSTRATED BY DYAS 

moral principles, and a rare, 
perhaps unique approach to 
science. 

On that first visit Will 
showed me some things he 
had tinkered up : an oval 

wheel with two axles, which 
kept one long side on the 
ground, and which he felt 
might be a sensible substitute 
for endless treads on tractors 
and tanks; how to drill a one 
twenty-five thousandth of an 
inch hole through a piece of 
glass (I understand he later 
patented this as a way to per- 
forate contact lenses to per- 
mit circulation of natural 
tears) ; a device for reproduc- 
ing irregular surfaces; a mod- 
el of a device to make possi- 
ble three-dimensional photog- 
raphy ; and a demonstration, 
viewable by the naked eye, of 
a monomolecular layer. While 
I ate Greek meatballs (the 


50 







ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL and 




best I have ever tasted, which 
were lovingly made by his 
loving wife Mary) he de- 
scribed to me his invention of 
a device which would permit 
a minesweeper’s paravane 
cable to contact the anchor 
chain of a mine and pass 
through it, leaving the mine 
right where it was. That one 
was never debugged; in 
time, marine growth would 
foul it. But it was breathtak- 
ingly ingenious and — like all 
his inspirations — kindergar- 
ten-simple. 

This article is about science 
and invention, but I would 
like to say parenthetically 
that during this and many 
subsequent visits, we talked 
about something else — writing 
in general, sf in particular. 
Will Jenkins gave me certain 
aids and precepts, each of 
them brilliantly simple and 
simply brilliant, which I fol- 
low to this day. I don’t think 
I have ever before made pub- 
lic acknowledgement of this: 
I do herewith. It is a debt I 
shall never be able to repay. 

N OW, the really remarkable 
thing about these gim- 
micks and gadgets of his, 
something which transcends 
their cleverness, is that each 
and every one of them was 
sniwied up out of materials 
which cost from zero all the 
way up to fifty cents. And 
had he a workshop? He had 
not. He lived in one of those 
brick-face ten-story apartment 
houses on Long Island, sur- 
52 


rounded by a number of 
daughters (all pretty) and 
vast numbers of their friends, 
all of whom seemed welcome 
at all times. Not only had he 
no workshop, he had no of- 
fice, den or studio. There was 
an elderly upright typewriter 
on a castered typing table in 
a corner of the living room, 
and that was, so help me, all 
the indication there was that 
there might be a writer in the 
place. 

It isn’t that he could not 
have had a den of his own had 
he wanted it — I'm sure he 
could. He simply seemed to 
prefer to work in a corner of 
the room, at the edge of this 
dynamic domesticity. It cost 
him, apparently, no pain to 
stop between sentences and 
drive down to pick up a kid 
at school, or to sweat out 
someone’s second-year alge- 
bra. And just by the way, I 
think he burned no midnight 
oil. 

Yet, living like this, he 
turned out solid story after 
story, making himself a main- 
stay of the old Thrilling 
Wonder, Startling Stories and 
Astounding during what has 
come to be known as the Gold- 
en Age of sf. 

But let’s look at the part of 
Will Jenkins which produced 
these fabulous gilhoolies of 
his. His tools were scissors 
and paste, a paper-punch, 
tweezers, paperclips, some 
dime-store pliers and a screw- 
driver. His materials were 
coat-hangers, cardboard, a few 

by Theodore Sturgeon 



stray Erector-set parts, string, 
a second-hand pane or two of 
window glass, some old twists 
of wire and a No. 6 dry cell. 
He used, also, that extraordi- 
nary mind, honed sharp, 
placed at a unique angle, pow- 
ered by a specialized curiosity 
and aimed at an unexpected 
direction. 

This specialty is the or- 
phaned twigs on the tree of 
science. His aim was at their 
bases, the places where the 
thick main boughs grew to- 
ward their several sections of 
sky, caring little about these 
slender offshoots. For such is 
science that its primary limbs, 
carrying upward the currents 
of invention and technology, 
are covered with neglected 
shoots. And it would seem 
that the upper, later, more re- 
cent branches are quite as 
hairy as the main trunk. All 
along the way, little-noted, 
bypassed phenomena are wait- 
ing for the man who can ad- 
minister just the right squirt 
of vital fluid. Such a twig 
can grow into a mighty arm 
of the tree, even if it has been 
dormant for years. 

A perfect example is radar, 
which was a recorded phe- 
nomenon fifty years before ra- 
dio. And in a lesser — far less- 
er — area there is that which I 
call the Kick Yourself De- 
partment. 

The Kick Yourself Depart- 
ment is that species of inven- 
tion which someone comes up 
with and makes a classic buck, 
and when you see it you kick 
ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL and 


yo urself for not having 
thought of it first. In the De- 
partment are obvious, simple 
or even simrde-minded inven- 
tions. 

Such controversial inspira- 
tions as Ehrenhaft’s magnetic 
flux and the Hieronymous ma- 
chine do not qualify. A thing 
like the hula hoop does. Yo- 
yos. The beanie with the pro- 
pellers spinning on it. Cadil- 
lac's new turn light which, 
activated by the directional 
switch, floods the road on the 
side to which you are about 
to turn, with a beam pointed 
45° off the centerline: you see 
what you’re turning into. The 
rotary lawnmower. Cecil 
Hughes’s rotating-cylinder 
engine (if you’ve never heard 
of this jaw-dropper, look it 
up.) 

What these all have in com- 
mon is that they are based 
on simple principles (simple, 
that is, once you see them 
done by someone else : that’s 
when you kick yourself) 
which were evident or self- 
evident; which filled a want 
or need which had existed for 
a long time (the beanie could 
have been perfected in the 
eleventh century, the turn 
light forty years ago)... and 
which needed no more brains 
than you have to produce. 

T HE Class Two Kick Your- 
self inventions are those 
filling a new demand, result- 
ing, for example, from some 
technological improvement. I 
disclose herewith (Messrs.

el, surrounding the magnetic 
lid-catcher on my wall-mount- 
ed can opener. Yes, Junior, I 
know the magnet works just 
fine. But J u n i o r — they’re 
starting to make cans out of 
aluminum. 

Other examples of Class 
Two K.Y-S ideas are a nation- 
wide magazine on TV sub- 
jects, with regional program 
listings bound in (and TV 
Guide has pulled itself up 
into Life’s circulation league 
in a few short years) ; dish 
detergents (tri-sodium phos- 
phate, key ingredient, had 
been around for years as a 
wetting agent in industry be- 
fore anyone thought to make 
it a consumer item; mean- 
while the electric dishwasher, 
all but perfected in the late 
twenties, sat around waiting 
for it) ; and the many tools 
and attachments, like the 
screw-pilot bit, which drills 
for thread, shank and counter- 
sink all at once, which await- 
ed the advent of the portable 
drill, yet still hung around 
unborn. 

Class One devices, when 
you come right down to it, 
are really only Class Two de- 
vices which just took a long 
-time getting thought of. 

Science is full of neglected 
but unhidden wonders. Will 
Jenkins’ microscopic hole- 
drilling technique is based on 
54 


a phenomenon known to Ben- 
jamin Franklin; another of 
his inventions, used as a TV 
effect, derives from an illu- 
sion used a century ago by 
stage magicians. Granted that 
they await your exploitation 
and mine, where do we go to 
find them? 

Why, back dp>yn the trunk 
of the Tree of Science, of 
course. There are some bril- 
liant men around today : so 
there were fifty and a hun- 
dred and two hundred years 
ago. Today, of course, our 
thinking has the immense ad- 
vantage of advanced systemi- 
zation and sophisticated tools 
and equipment. Research pro- 
gresses into the future like a 
mighty be-chromed locomo- 
tive flashing through the 
countryside. The researchers 
of the past, on the other hand, 
went through the landscape 
on foot, picking their way. 
The rails weren’t laid yet... 
and that advantage is in some 
ways immenser. For those 
boys paced along slowly with 
their eyes wide open. They 
may have followed a wrong 
trail occasionally, and over- 
looked a right one here and 
there. But they investigated 
many more things than the 
modern, all horsepower and 
momentum, has time for. 

These are the researches 
which always delighted Will 
Jenkins, and their kind of 
thinking was his kind of 
thinking when he built his 
oval wheel and when he 
showed me, over his kitchen

sink, a demonstrated monomo- 
lecular layer. 

B UT if you would like to 
look at some of the things 
they observed, and discovered, 
and theorized about, you’ve 
got to get the fog out of your 
eyes. This fog runs out of the 
corners of your mouth when 
you put on that grin. 

Because an old book re- 
cords the speed of light at 
192,500 mps and electricity 
through wires at “not less 
than 200,000 mps” and 12,000 
mps respectively for short- 
you put on that grin. 

. .Malarial poison is gen- 
erally most troublesome 
in those years in which 
there has been a deficien- 
cy in the rainfall. ...un- 
der these circumstances 
the water in marshes hav- 
ing fallen below its nor- 
mal level, the black slime 
of organic matter forming 
their beds has been ex- 
posed to the strong heat 
of the summer sun, and 
the malarial emanations 
thereby increased in 
quantity and intensity. 
Low water in. .great riv- 
ers...^ also followed by 
increase in and aggrava- 
tion of malarial trou- 
bles... Malaria likewise 
occurs from the mere up- 
turning of earth which 
has been undisturbed for 
many years... Even the 
ploughing of an old or- 


chard is not without its ef- 
fect (but) if the upturn- 
ing is done late in the 
fall, and the earth ex- 
posed to winter frosts, 
there is much less prob- 
ability of malarial emana- 
tions, than if the earth is 
turned late in the spring 
or during the summer. 
The winter air, charged 
as it is with ozone... ex- 
erts its destructive action 
upon it. 

Such statements are not 
out-and-out wrongheaded. If 
they derive from ignorance, 
it is an innocent ignorance, 
not a stupid ignorance. And 
if the statements are used to 
smear everything in the book, 
the smearer does injustice to 
the author, to science and de- 
cidedly to himself. 

I have such a book. It’s 
called Medical Physics. It’s 
by John C. Draper, M. D., 
LL. D., of N.Y.U. It was pub- 
lished by Lea and Co. of 
Philadelphia in 1885. It runs 
733 pages and has nearly four 
hundred illustrations, mostly 
beautifully precise steel en- 
gravings. It is what it says it 
is : a textbook of physics for 
doctors. It deals with heat, 
light, electricity, hydrody- 
namics, and all the other 
classical wings of physics, 
and relates each to medical 
practice of the time. It makes 
absolutely fascinating read- 
ing. 

But it’s not going to do a 
thing for anyone who throws

it down because the man says 
malaria is caused by “sulfu- 
retted hydrogen”. I do feel, 
however, that it is a mother 
lode of Will Jenkins’ kind of 
orphan-offshoot science. 

I’d like to give you a cou- 
ple of examples, but permit 
me this disclaimer. It may be 
that I’m committing an inno- 
cent ignorance in quoting 
these items: to the specialist 
in the disciplines involved, I 
may be reporting a justifiably 
discarded commonplace. All I 
can say is that I’ve read rath- 
er widely, and these items hit 
me as brand “new.” 

In following up the ex- 
periments which led to 
the discovery of the pho- 
tophone, Prof. Graham 
Bell says: “In my Boston 
paper the discovery was 
announced that thin disks 
of very many substances 
emitted sounds when ex- 
posed to the action of a 
rapidly interrupted beam 
of s u n 1 i g h t. .. focused 
into one end of an open 
tube, the ear being at the 
other end. Upon inter- 
rupting the beam, a clear, 
musical tone was heard, 
the pitch of which de- 
pended upon the frequen- 
cy of the interruption of 
the light, and the loud- 
ness upon the material 
composing the tube... In 
order to study these ef- 
fects under better circum- 
stances the materials were 
enclosed in a conical cav- 
56 


ity in a piece of brass 
closed (at the large end) 
by a piece of glass. A 
brass tube (from the 
small end) served for con- 
nection to a hearing-tube. 
When this conical cavity 
was stuffed with worsted 
or other fibrous materials 
the sounds were much 
louder than when a tube 
was employed... Upon 
smoking the interior of 
the conical cavity, and 
then exposing it to the 
intermittent beam, with 
the glass lid in position, 
the effect was perfectly 
startling. The sound was 
so loud as to be actually 
painful to an ear placed 
closely against the end of 
the hearing tube. In re- 
gard to materials. .. em- 
sounds are produced from 
ployed ... the loudest 
substances in a loose, 
porous, spongy condition, 
and from those that have 
the darkest or most ab- 
sorbent colors (Italics 
Prof. Bell’s, and by golly 
mine too) . cotton-wool, 
worsted, fibrous materials 
generally, cork, sponge, 
platinum and other metals 
in a spongy condition, 
and from those that have 
the darkest or most ab- 
sorbent colors. 

Unless Prof. Bell is kidding 
us, which I genuinely doubt, 
he has here a kind of audio 
amplifier drawing no power, 
but using some vibratory ef-

Adolescence is a perilous time — 
whether it is the adolescence of a man, 


or of the whole race of Man!

58 





T HE physics teacher, How- 
ard Dax, dismissed the 
class. He picked up a felt-cov- 
ered block and erased the dia- 
grams he had drawn on the 
blackboard. He noticed with 
annoyance that the lines were 
shaky, and in one place was 
an irregular star where the 
chalk had broken because of 
his exasperation at his pupils 
— or more exactly, one par- 
ticular pupil. 

When the blackboard was 
clean to the corners — Howard 
Dax was a very precise man — 
he turned around and saw that 
the particular pupil Was still 
sitting at his desk. He was a 
thin boy of fifteen, called 
Mallison, whose dark, wavy 
hair was too long. It rose in a 
kind of breaker over hi^ fore- 
head, and he had sideburns cut 
to a point. His expression was 
neither sullen nor imperti- 


nent, but Dax had always had 
the feeling that Mallison was 
concealing intense boredom 
and only listened to him per- 
force. He was sure that the 
narrow, rather handsome face 
was on the verge of sneering. 
But there had never been 
quite anything that he could 
put his finger on. The boy 
was definitely not good at 
physics, yet he wasn’t at the 
bottom of the class. The thing 
was that he gave the impres- 
sion of being above average 
intelligence. He obviously 
could do very much better if 
he wanted to. Dax was con- 
vinced that he despised phy- 
sics, and school in general. 

“Yes?” Dax said. “What is 
it?” He tried to make his 
voice sound natural and cas- 
ual. 

Mallison stared at him im- 
passively for a moment. Then 



59 




he said, "You don't like me, 
Mr. Dax, do you?" 

"My dear boy, I neither like 
you nor dislike you,” Dax 
said. He could feel his hands 
beginning again to tremble 
slightly. Damn adrenalin! "I 
am merely trying to teach you 
elementary physics. Why do 
you ask?" 

"Why do you give me such 
low grades?" Mallison said, 
but with no sense of urgent 
curiosity. 

Howard Dax thought that 
the boy’s manner was altogeth- 
er too adult. He didn’t expect 
deference from a modern teen- 
ager, but neither did he like 
to be spoken to in such a man- 
to-man way. No; come to 
think of it, man-to-man wasn’t 
quite the phrase. It was off- 
hand. And yet it was artifi- 
cial: Mallison never spoke in 
this way to his contempora- 
ries. He usually talked like 
a. .what was it? Hipster? 

"I give students the grades 
that in my opinion they de- 
serve," Dax said. "In your case 
they are low because I don’t 
think you’re trying." 

"I am trying," Mallison 
said, then added, "sir." 

"You are," Dax said. "Very." 
He thought the remark was 
rather neat, but the boy 
looked at him without any 
change of expression. Why 
was he here? What did he 
want to say? "I must confess," 
Dax went on, "that I am sur- 
prised at your interest in 
grades. I should have thought 
that rock-and-roll was more 
60 


your style. That and. .er. 
racing around at night in a 
fast car !" He felt that he was 
sneering, and made his face 
blank. 

"I’m too young for a driv- 
er’s license," Mallison said. 

"But old enough to pull 
yourself together and do some 
real work. You could do much 
better in class. You’re not 
stupid." 

T HE boy said nothing and 
continued to stare at him 
without expression. 

"When I see signs of an im- 
proved attitude," Dax said, 
"and a little more work, I shall 
mark you accordingly. One 
gets the impression usually 
that your mind is on other 
things. Things like jazz rec- 
ords." 

"Didn’t you listen to jazz 
when you were young, Mr. 
Dax?" 

Howard Dax at thirty-nine 
hardly thought of himself as 
old. The boy was not being 
exactly fresh, but he had a 
sort of polite tactlessness. It 
was absurd, but he felt that 
Mallison had the upper hand, 
somehow. 

Dax had an older brother 
who had been a lieutenant in 
World War II, and he had 
described to him an occasion 
on which he had interviewed 
an elderly staff sergeant. The 
staff sergeant in civilian life 
had been his brother’s boss. 
Although his manner was 
scrupulously correct, there 
remained an atmosphere of his 

by Stephen Barr 



peacetime ascendancy. How- 
ard Dax sympathized with his 
brother. There was nothing 
actually wrong with Malli- 
son’s manner, but the pupil 
had the master on the de- 
fensive. 

He decided to ignore Mal- 
lison’s question. He had no 
idea how the young nowadays 
felt about the subject of early 
Benny Goodman or the emer- 
gence of Barrel House. Why 
was he even bothering? 

“The point at issue,” he said 
with asperity, “is not whether 
I used to listen to jazz twen- 
ty-five years ago, but whether 
you are going to pay atten- 
tion in class now. I admit you 
manage to scrape through in 
the tests, but this morning, for 
example, you acted as if you 
were half asleep !” 

“I’m sorry. I was very 
tired.” Mallison did look pale. 

“I suppose you were up half 
the night — cutting a rug.” 

Mallison winced at the out- 
dated jargon but he merely 
shook his head. There were 
firm steps in the corridor, and 
the school principal marched 
in. 

Mallison stood up; Dax was 
still standing. The principal 
had a small piece of folded 
paper in his hand, and did not 
immediately notice the boy, 
whose desk was near the back 
row and next the open win- 
dows. He went straight to the 
platform and put the folded 
paper on Dax’s desk. He nod- 
ded curtly and glanced to- 
wards the windows, and saw 
TYBALT 


Mallison sitting there for the 
first time. 

ii T thought you were alone,” 

-■-he said, turning to Dax. 

“You may go,” Dax said to 
the boy. “That will be all. Re- 
member what I said.” He 
looked at the folded paper and 
then at the principal question- 
ingly. “Yes, Mr. Lightstone?” 

The principal was a short 
white-haired man v with a 
dogged expression. He turned 
again to make sure the boy 
had left and said. “I want you 
to look at this, Dax.” He 
tapped the folded paper, 
which had been made into a 
sort of envelope, with its ends 
tucked in. Dax bent to exam- 
ine it. 

“Pick it up, man! Open it,” 
the principal said, and came 
around and sat in the teach- 
er’s chair. “Be careful not to 
spill it!” 

Dax picked up the little 
packet and opened it. Inside 
was a teaspoonful of white 
powder. “What is it?” he 
asked. 

“That,” said the principal, 
“is something for our friends 
upstairs in the chemistry de- 
partment to determine. I 
found it myself, in the flower- 
bed right outside these win- 
dows !” 

Howard Dax looked puz- 
zled. “I don’t think I under- 
stand — ” 

“If I don’t miss my bet,” 
said the principal, “that’s 
heroin!” He jerked his head 
towards the windows. “And 

61 



somebody threw it out of this 
classroom !” 

“Oh, I don’t think it’s her- 
oin, Mr. Lightstone,” Dax 
said. “Heroin has a distinct 
glitter, and this seems — ” 

“I had the impression you 
were a physicist, not a chem- 
ist,” the principal said. “Be- 
sides, the police told us last 
week that they believe a gang 
of narcotics pushers — I think 
they called them — are operat- 
ing in the neighborhood ! 
What else could it be? I’ve 
been on the lookout for some- 
thing of this sort.” 

There was a silence. Dax 
didn’t know what to say. 

He himself was very tired, 
he had been working late eve- 
ry evening. He had three dif- 
ferent tasks that occupied 
every minute of his waking 
hours: his job as teacher be- 
ing the least important al- 
though the most essential. The 
other two were perhaps vi- 
sionary, but they might lead 
to something more exciting 
than retiring on a pension. 

“Well?” Mr. Lightstone was 
impatient — his usual condi- 
tion. “Have you any ideas? It 
has been my experience that 
drug-taking and juvenile de- 
linquency go together.” This 
was not strictly true as Mr. 
Lightstone had never know- 
ingly seen a drug-taker, but 
he did read the papers. 

“I suppose there is a cer- 
tain amount of delinquency 
here,” Howard Dax said un- 
certainly, “but narcotics . .” 
“Wake up, man!” the prin- 
62 


cipal said. “You look half 
asleep! This is a serious mat- 
ter. I found the stuff right 
outside these windows! You 
must have some idea of who 
might be involved. Which are 
the unruly ones? Who sits 
next the windows?” 

Dax glanced at the desk re- 
cently left by Mallison. Malli- 
son? One couldn’t exactly call 
him unruly. Yet he had the 
earmarks of a type he detested 
and instinctively mistrusted. 
He even feared him a little, 
though not perhaps for rea- 
sons of which he was quite 
aware. 

“Who was that boy that 
just left?” The principal had 
noticed the direction of Dax’s 
glance. “Mallison, wasn’t it?” 
“Yes, but the packet might 
just as well have been thrown 
from one of the paths out- 
side.” 

“There’s no path near here. 
You know that perfectly 
well,” said the principal. 
“There’s a wide stretch of 
grass beyond the flower bed 
and no one’s allowed to walk 
on it ! I’ve had my eye on that 
boy. .” 

H oward Dax thought 

this over. Come to think 
of it, he wouldn’t put such a 
thing past the young smart- 
alec. Hoodlumism doesn’t nec- 
essarily advertise itself in the 
classroom. 

He looked at the principal. 
The man had a nerve to ac- 
cuse him of seeming half 
asleep! Working in his pri- 

by Stephen Barr 



vate lab after dinner and then 
at his desk until all hours, 
struggling to learn Middle 
English — or rather, transition- 
al Anglo-Saxon. He had done 
well at English lit at college, 
even though majoring in sci- 
ence, and Chaucer had come 
fairly easy to him. But 
Twelfth Century speech — and 
that was what he had to learn 
— was something else again. 
Chaucer himself couldn’t have 
understood it. He wondered 
what young Mallison and his 
hipster friends would think if 
they knew his secret occupa- 
tions. He could just imagine 
the sneering. 

“Well, you could be right,” 
I suppose,” he said. “He’s not 
my — shall I say ? — favorite 
pupil.” 

“I’m glad you think I could 
be right,” Mr. Lightstone said. 
“I intend to hold an investiga- 
tion. At the first possible op- 
portunity. This very evening, 
in fact. At my office, and I 
shall have young Mallison 
brought before us. I shall ex- 
pect you.” He got up and 
strutted out of the class room. 

After a few moments How- 
ard Dax followed him. Out- 
side, on his way to the gate, 
he passed Mallison, who was 
standing talking to another 
boy who had a similar hair- 
cut, but was unfamiliar to the 
physics teacher. He thought 
he was not a pupil of this 
school. They both became si- 
lent as he drew near them, 
looking at him without any 
expression. Dax wondered if 
TYBALT 


narcotics could be responsible 
for Mallison’s pallor. 

After dinner Dax went into 
his little lab, which was ac- 
tually the kitchenette he nev- 
er used. On the table and sink 
was some chemical apparatus. 
The principal’s remark had 
been ill-chosen since Dax at 
college had started, with chem- 
istry as his major and had 
only switched to physics in 
his senior year. He had also 
become interested in genetics, 
and it was this all-around in- 
terest in the sciences that had 
perhaps militated against him. 
Nowadays one ought to spe- 
cialize. 

Well, he was specializing 
now. 

In an evaporating dish in 
the sink were some dark 
brown crystals that his land- 
lady would have taken for 
Damerara sugar, but which 
had a considerably more com- 
plex formula. They would 
have lent a rather odd flavor 
to Indian pudding. The logic 
which had given rise to this 
formula was not merely com- 
plex but revolutionary. It in- 
volved the concept of reversi- 
bility of entropy — the applica- 
tion of which was itself un- 
precedented. 

There were, Howard Dax 
was aware, certain aspects of 
germ chemistry that defied 
description in terms of classi- 
cal and mechanistic theory ; 
details that seemed to require 
the inversion of Time’s arrow. 
To say that a physical process 
was “non-reversible” usually 

63 



implied the presence of the 
probability factor. But that 
didn't seem to be the case 
here. There was the sugges- 
tion of prophecy. Or else that 
time was flowing backwards. 
Or... was it that something 
flowed backward through 
time? 

Then there was the fact that 
the germ plasm was immortal. 
Not indestructible, for the 
overwhelming majority of zy- 
gotes and gametes died; but 
if one disregarded the soma, 
all living germ cells had been 
alive since the beginning of 
life. After terrific work, none 
of which would have seemed 
quite orthodox to his col- 
leagues, Dax had arrived at 
the end of theory and the be- 
ginning of practical applica- 
tion — at the taking-off point 
— the countdown. 

L YING on the drainboard 
near the evaporating dish 
was a hypodermic syringe. 

If he were to dissolve the 
dark brown crystals and in- 
ject {he solution into his 
veins, Dax believed that what- 
ever it was that impeded this 
time-reversal would be neu- 
tralized. His consciousness — 
not his body, his somatic cells 
— would travel back along the 
unbroken line of his identity 
as a germinal continuity. Back 
to the extent that the effect 
of the chemical would allow. 

He would then be in the 
body of one of his ancestors. 
Not spread among them all, 
but following the line of 
64 


greatest genetic valence to one 
individual : living in the 

Twelfth Century A. D. Prob- 
ably, but not certainly, some- 
where in England, since most 
of his ancestors came from 
there. 

Of course the time might 
be wrong. He had no way of 
making a precise determina- 
tion. He had experimented 
with a rabbit, but after the 
soft little beast's eyes glazed 
over in unconsciousness it had 
immediately come to. The 
time taken during its visit to 
the purlieus of its remote and 
unknown forebears was of no 
duration in the present. And 
it had at once attacked him 
and bitten him savagely. 

It seemed curious that an 
ancestral rabbit at a period 
not so very far back from a 
biological point of view 
should have a spirit so foreign 
to the rabbits of today. Per- 
haps the drug had overshot its 
mark. 

What if that were to hap- 
pen in his case? Wouldn’t it 
perhaps take him to some 
earlier, non-human form and 
then, as it were, rebound to 
the precise moment in history 
that the strength of the drug 
indicated? A man is not a rab- 
bit. But suppose he found 
himself not in the body of a 
Twelfth Century Englishman 
— a risky enough situation — 
but hanging by his tail from 
a tree in Java? How long be- 
fore the hypothetical rebound 
to the time of the Plantagen- 
ets?

Howard Dax was too tired 
to concentrate on the prob- 
lem: it was probably moon- 
shine. The rabbit had been 
frightened, not atavistic. 

The cumulative effect of 
overwork and irritation at the 
boy Mallison and the princi- 
pal’s manner had made him 
reckless and impatient. He 
made a sudden decision to 
stop worrying about precau- 
tions and take the plunge... 
now. 

He had plenty of time be- 
fore the meeting. The trip to 
the past would have no dura- 
tion in the present. He meas- 
ured out an amount of dis- 
tilled water and stirred the 
brown crystals into it with a 
glass rod. Then he filled the 
hypodermic and v/ent into his 
bed-siittingroom. 

He went to his desk and 
took a last look at a list of 
early English irregular verbs 
and lay down on his sofa, roll- 
ing up his sleeve. 

He hardly felt the prick of 
the needle but he realized that 
the rather painful bump on 
his f orehead had distracted his 
attention from it. 

He looked at the thing he 
had bumped against. It was 
wooden and round in section, 
about as thick as his neck, and 
rose at a slight deviation from 
the vertical to a circular plat- 
form that was supported at 
other places by two more 
wooden uprights. Beyond and 
above was an immensely lofty 
roof of dark timbers. Far to 
the sides were stone walls. 
TYBALT 


He looked down to discover 
that the cold floor under him 
was also of stone, covered 
here and there with dry yel- 
lowish reeds. Then he saw 
that he was on all fours. 

Instead of hands he had 
black, furry paws. 

II 

T RICE, the jester, was get- 
ting old. So, he feared, 
were his jokes. 

His joints were stiff and he 
could no longer do the amus- 
ing contortions that used so 
to entertain the Earl and his 
little court. In fact, the Earl 
was getting on, too. He looked 
as though he was falling 
asleep in his chair. Next to 
him the Lady Godwina was 
mumbling and giggling — not 
at poor Trice’s feeble quips, 
but as a result of too much 
blackberry wine mixed with 
mead. She hiccoughed loudly 
and the Earl opened his eyes. 

He glanced at the Lady 
Godwina with bored distaste, 
and then at Trice the jester. 
Would that the fellow would 
cease his tedious clowning 
and go to the kitchens! Yet 
he hesitated to get rid of him 
altogether. Having a jester at 
all in these days was a mark 
of prestige, and he didn’t 
know where he’d get a re- 
placement. 

Now that King Henry was 
dead he had fortified his cas- 
tle like the other barons. 
Since feudal pomp had be- 
come the fashion he hung onto 

65 



its trappings — poor old Trice 
was one of them. But, ye gods, 
what stale jokes! Well, at 
least they seemed to please 
the younger serving men, who 
must be too young to remem- 
ber them. 

Trice was unhappily aware 
that his humor was missing 
the mark. He fell back on the 
one thing that never failed 
to make them laugh. He swung 
his bauble and hit himself on 
the nose. He staggered back 
with comic terror. “Hold on!” 
he cried to an imaginary as- 
sailant. “Not so hard! M He 
struck himself again, harder. 
“Stop ! Or I shall appeal to 
my noble lord for protection !” 

The Earl smiled faintly; he 
didn’t want to disappoint the 
old man. Besides, his nose was 
bleeding. It really was rather 
funny. Curious about these 
people : they had almost no 
sense of pain. Trice, seeing 
the smile, hit himself again 
and again, and feeling the 
blood, he smeared it over his 
face in fantastic curlicues. 
The Earl closed his eyes 
again, and Trice caught the 
eye of the clerk, a young man 
who had come from Norman- 
dy. He was sneering. The 
Lady Godwina was singing a 
little tune to herself, and paid 
no attention. 

The old jester shrugged, 
and turned towards the arch- 
way to the kitchens and of- 
fices. Better have supper and 
o to bed — his head ached and 
is nose hurt badly, although 
the bleeding had stopped. 
6S 


Next to a wooden stool he 
caught sight of his cat, Ty- 
balt, staring at him fixedly. 
Tybalt. His only friend! he 
thought to himself. But as he 
passed him, the cat, instead 
of following him out with tail 
erect to share the jester’s 
wretched supper, backed 
cringing under the stool and 
turned his head as he went 
by, keeping his staring eyes 
on him. Most unusual. Very 

“Here! Tybalt!” Trice said, 
but the cat backed further 
away. 

J UST before he realized 
what had happened to him, 

Dax recognized that the big 
wooden thing that loomed 
over him was a stool. 

Maybe it was this realiza- 
tion — and the sight of his own 
paws — that gave him an idea 
of his size, and on looking 
back at the rest of himself he 
knew that he was a cat. Some- 
thing had gone wrong. The 
flashback and subsequent re- 
bound must have taken him 
far into the dim mammalian 
past, but for what duration he 
could not tell. The transition 
had been unconscious. At 
least he did not remember it. 
But to judge by the style of 
the round stone arches of the 
hall he was now in — and the 
stonework looked brand new 
— the ultimate effect had been 
according to plan, and this 
was the early Middle Ages. 

A movement caught his eye 
and he saw it was the cavort-

ing of an enormous man, 
dressed in gigantic tattered 
motley. 

No. He wasn’t enormous; it 
was just the unfamiliar scale 
of things. The man was say- 
ing something in a booming 
voice, and Dax began to rec- 
ognize it as a form of transi-. 
tional early English — b u t 
with an admixture of Norman 
French and some pure Anglo- 
Saxon phrases. And what an 
accent! If this man was typi- 
cal, how wrong modern re- 
search and learned speculation 
were ! He would have some 
interesting things to tell the 
experts — particularly his tu- 
tor — when he got back. 

When he got back. That 
was supposed to be in three 
days approximately, when the 
inhibiting effect of the chem- 
ical would wear off. Then he 
would, he hoped, be swept 
back to his own time and his 
own body. But he was a cat. 
This was disastrous! How 
could he speak to people? He 
could understand them fairly 
well, but a cat’s bucal cavity 
and vocal apparatus were not 
designed for the sounds of 
human speech. 

He decided to try his voice, 
just on the chance, but 
stopped, horrified at the muf- 
fled yowl that resulted. 

Two rangy hounds, six 
times his size, roused them- 
selves from the rush-covered 
floor and glared growling at 
the sound with raised hackles. 
“Down, Colie ! Stop it, Bay- 
ard!” a gruff voice comrnand- 

68 


ed, and they reluctantly sank 
back again, keeping their 
fierce eyes on him. Was this 
a sample of what he must ex- 
pect from dogs? He hoped it 
was merely his abortive at- 
tempt at human speech. Any 
further communication must 
be tried silently. 

He looked around the hall. 
There were other humans too. 
Several men-at-arms standing 
by the walls and a few serving 
men. At the big trestle-board 
were seated five people — one 
of them clearly the lord of the 
castle — it must be a castle — 
and the one woman sitting 
next to him in soiled finery 
would be his lady. The place 
reeked with the stale odor of 
humans and dogs, and less ob- 
noxiously the smell of wood 
smoke and cooked meat. Dax 
realized that he now had a 
feline nose, and made allow- 
ances. After all, the well-to- 
do bathed themselves, in the 
still existing classic tradition, 
and would until the Black 
Death. 

The ridiculous giant in mot- 
ley stopped his capering and 
came across the stone flags 
towards him. As he passed 
with ponderous footsteps he 
looked down and said, “Here, 
Tybalt !” 

Dax backed under the stool, 
terrified at the deep, hoarse 
voice. The man was probably 
trying to be gentle. He must 
keep in mind that he had a 
cat’s hearing now, and all 
sounds would seem lower and 
louder. 


by Stephen Barr 



H OW were cats treated in 
Medieval England? He 
did not know, and he was not 
prepared for this contingency. 
But at least cats as a species 
had survived. He hoped he 
was one of the lucky ones. 
He must at all costs manage 
to keep alive for three days, 
because if he were killed be- 
fore the drug wore off he 
would not return. 

What would they think at 
the school? Nothing, of 
course. He would never have 
been there. That would be 
changing the future. .but 
you changed the future every 
time you exerted your free 
will, anyhow. 

One of his experimental 
rats had not come back: it 
had merely disappeared with 
a loud pop. Perhaps an early 
Colonial terrier had got it. It 
might be the best thing to do 
to take to the woods, and wait 
out the time safe from the 
unknown dangers of men and 
dogs — but what of the dan- 
gers of the woods? It was 
winter, to judge by the fire 
in the hall, on a raised stone 
platform in the middle of the 
floor, from which the smoke 
found its way out through a 
louver in the high roof. And 
the icy drafts that came across 
the floor. Although he was a 
cat, he had little confidence 
of being able to hunt like one, 
or find refuge from the cold 
and snow. 

He decided to follow the 
court jester. At least the man 
had spoken to him kindly. 

TYBALT 


And he had a name: Tybalt. 
He must remember to answer 
to it. 

He got up and began to walk 
towards the arched doorway 
through which the jester had 
disappeared. 

Walking on all fours felt 
perfectly natural — rather as if 
he were following himself. 
There was no trouble about 
keeping in step, or, rather, 
just out of it. His mouth was 
dry and he ran his tongue over 
his muzzle. .he could lick his 
eye ! Then he did something 
that also felt natural, though 
pleasantly novel : he waved his 
tail. Then he stuck out his 
claws. They clicked against 
the flagstones and he sheathed 
them again. 

He had never in his life felt 
so supple and physically com- 
plete. He felt like running up 
the tapestry that hung by the 
doorway. 

At the other end of the 
vaulted corridor that he four\d 
himself in he could see the 
jester as he went into another 
chamber that was lit with a 
smoky reddish glow. There 
was an increased smell of 
cookery, and he guessed it was 
the kitchen. 

When he got to the door 
he could see the jester was 
being given something in a 
bowl that steamed, and a 
large hunk of dark bread. The 
man turned and came out 
again and saw him. 

“Come along, Tybalt,” he 
said. “Supper for you and me. 
Come along, old fellow!” 

69 



Dax followed him across 
the corridor to a narrow stone 
stairway in the thickness of 
the wall. The winding steps 
seemed absurdly high. He 
would far rather have done 
the whole thing in two or 
three long leaps, but he took 
the steps one by one. Feline 
coordination would come to 
him in time. 

After an almost totally un- 
lit passage they came to a 
minute room, scarcely more 
than a cell. The jester struck 
a light with flint and steel 
to a tallow candle, and sat 
down on a low straw-covered 
bed. The flo^r was freezing. 
Dax jumped up onto a small 
table, but was instantly 
pushed off it. His instinctive 
jump up and then down hap- 
pened so quickly that he only 
realized in retrospect what a 
feat it was from a man’s point 
of view. Yet he had landed 
clumsily. He was not yet quite 
a cat. 

T HE jester cut off a piece 
of dubious-looking meat 
and threw it onto the floor. 
“Wait till it cools, Tybalt,” 
he said, and scratched Dax be- 
hind the ears. Dax was 
ravenous, which seemed odd 
considering he’d had dinner 
half an hour ago. No, of 
course not. That was eight 
centuries in the future; God 
knew when Tybalt had last 
eaten. Disregarding the ad- 
monition he went at once to 
the meat, which was pork, and 
burned his mouth. It smelled 
70 


glorious. And yet he suspect- 
ed that in human form he 
would have revolted from it. 

He looked up at his master. 
He had a conviction that he 
belonged to the jester. 

He studied the gaunt, blood- 
smeared face. It looked as if 
someone had hit him on the 
nose. The cap-and-bells, with 
its attached wimple-shaped 
neck piece, had been laid 
aside. The gray bobbed hair 
and bony head looked any- 
thing but merry. There was, 
however, a shrewd reflective 
expression in the eyes, and 
Dax felt that he might well 
be in an advantageous posi- 
tion. Being a jester probably 
involved a certain amount of 
tact and discretion, not to 
mention ingenuity, so he re- 
solved to try to communicate 
with him. 

But first he must eat. 
Would the damned pork nev- 
er cool? 

The jester was already eat- 
ing his, in great gulps, alter- 
nating it with bits of the evil- 
looking bread. There was a 
stoneware pot that smelled 
strongly of musty ale from 
which he drank every now and 
then. The stench of alcohol 
in it was like spoiled garbage 
to Dax. How had he ever been 
able to drink whisky? The 
thought of it was disgusting. 
The meat was cool enough 
now — in fact stone cold — and 
he tore it to pieces with his 
pointed teeth and bolted it 
unchewed. It was marvelous. 

“Well, Tybalt ?” the jester 

by Stephen Barr 



said, putting aside his bowl. 
“No mice today? We are not 
very lucky, we two, are we?” 
He made a snapping with his 
fingers and Dax jumped up 
onto the pallet beside him. 
The old man stroked his back 
gently, but he had a very 
strong smell. Dax supposed he 
would get used to his new 
keen senses in time. He hoped 
it would be soon. It was very 
cold in the jester's cell and 
he intended to creep close at 
bed time. In the meanwhile 
how was he going to make 
known his true identity? Ob- 
viously speech was impossi- 
ble; and Morse-code tapping 
with his paw was out of the 
question. 

You wouldn’t get very far 
with mere facial expressions, 
either. Anyway, to most hu- 
man eyes a cat has but two: 
contentment and fear. He 
looked around wondering if 
there were any small movable 
objects that he could arrange 
into the form of the letters 
of the alphabet — even a piece 
of string might do. But he 
feared that the man couldn’t 
read. Anyway there was no 
string to be seen. 

Then on the table, which 
was scarcely more than a high 
bench, he saw a rosary with 
wooden beads. 

He got up and stretched— 
never in his life had he been 
able to stretch like this — and 
jumped delicately over onto 
the table. The jester reached 
out and swept him off it. Not 
roughly, but it was obvious he 
TYBALT 


wasn’t allowed there. This 
time his landing was more 
skillful. He sat on the cold 
floor and tried to think how 
he could get hold of the 
beads. If he had them on the 
floor he could push them into 
an arresting shape. A triangle 
perhaps, or a figure eight, 
that would catch the jester’s 
eye. He looked up at a move- 
ment and saw that the man 
had picked up a small vellum 
book and was holding it close 
to his face. What luck! he 
could read after all! But how 
was he going to make letters? 

Near the sill of the door 
were some pieces of straw. He 
went over and examined them. 
He realized that a cat’s vision 
is rather poor compared to a 
man’s: quick to notice and in- 
terpret motion, but in other 
respects the over-large pupils, 
meant for nocturnal hunting, 
gave an inferior and uncertain 
image. 

T HE straw was dirty and 
smelled of horses, but it 
ought to do. The trouble was 
that when his face was close 
enough to pick it up with his 
teeth he could scarcely make 
it out. He couldn’t tell at first 
whether he had one or many 
in his mouth. He felt that his 
whiskers should tell him, but 
he was unaccustomed to their 
use. He padded over to the 
jester’s feet and dropped the 
straws. He backed off and 
looked at them, then with his 
paw he ineptly pushed them 
into an A. 

71 



He looked up. The jester 
was lost in his reading. 

Dax waited patiently, but 
the reading went on, and he 
patted the man’s foot with 
carefully sheathed claws. The 
jester glanced at him, though 
not at the crude, straw A, and 
smiled. 

“What now, Tybalt? More 
supper? That you will have 
to catch for yourself. See — 
it’s all gone! Share-and-share 
alike, old friend. I weigh 
eight stone. You’re but a scant 
four pound, so corresponding- 
ly...” He returned to his 
reading. 

Dax went and picked out 
some more straw which he 
brought back and attempted to 
arrange in a B, but gave it up 
and made an E instead. Then 
he made two crosses and a tri- 
angle. 

AEXXA. 

It looked like a fraternity. 
Then he mewed. 

The man looked down again 
with a faint frown. He didn’t 
seem to notice the straw 
shapes; judging from the way 
he held the book he was quite 
short-sighted. “Out?” he 
asked. “Out for a rat, poor 
Tybalt? Or to lie by the em- 
bers in the hall?” He shook 
his head and got up, and went 
to the door to open it. Dax 
jumped onto the bed and 
mewed again. The man paused 
with his hand on the latch, 
looking puzzled. Dax jumped 
down and dabbed with his 
paw next each letter suc- 
cessively. 

72 


“Why, what is this?” the 
old man said, smiling again. 
“Playfulness? The kitten is 
back!” He went to the table 
and picking up the bauble, 
made a feint with the stuffed 
bladder over Dax’s head. Dax 
dodged it irritably and mewed 
again; three times in quick 
succession. 

This caught the attention of 
the jester, who laid down the 
bauble. “Ah! A Tritheist! 
Will it get you a mouse, Ty- 
balt? V/ill it keep off evil 
spirits? It’s said the imps 
love cats — so beware of moon- 
light and mistletoe!” He 
picked Dax up and stroked 
him. 

It was infuriating. 

Dax was aware that the 
Medieval mind was very dif- 
ferent from the modern, but 
there must be some meeting 
point. Too bad this wasn’t 
Friar Roger Bacon — he’d have 
got his attention in no time. 
But he was a hundred years 
too early. His immediate prob- 
lem was to seek out some per- 
son who had enough imagina- 
tion and curiosity to take no- 
tice of a cat who behaved not 
as a cat. If he had only known 
this was going to happen! 

He tried mewing again, but 
the jester only smiled, so he 
mewed once, then twice and 
then three times. The jester 
shook his head admiringly. 
Like most of his contempora- 
ries the world for him was 
filled with wonders. It was 
an age of faith, not of specu- 
lation.

A pale moon showed 
through a narrow slit in the 
wall, which was unglazed, and 
he became aware that the 
light from the tallow dip was 
yellow, and the jester’s cos- 
tume red and green. 

So it was all nonsense about 
cats having no color vision — 
anyway, hadn’t some woman 
in California disproved that? 
Against the moon he could see 
the black outline of full- 
grown leaves on the nearby 
trees and knew it was not yet 
winter but autumn. When win- 
ter came in earnest, everyone 
from scullion to the lord of 
the manor would bed down in 
the Great Hall where the fire 
was. But the stonework of the 
castle was cold, and he felt 
himself getting drowsy. 

The^old jester put down his 
book, crossed himself and 
blew out the light. Dax could 
hear him burrowing into the 
straw of his bed, and nestled 
beside him. 

Ill 

W HEN he woke it was not 
quite dark, and a faint 
gray dawn came into the cell. 

The jester was snoring. 
Somewhere Dax thought he 
heard a rat. His muscles 
tensed, and he found himself 
on his feet by instinct — the 
idea of a rat was surprisingly 
attractive and he was hungry 
again. The noise stopped. He 
remembered that he had been 
having a dream — a strange 
nightmare of chasing after 
TYBALT 


Mallison and catching him, 
and tearing him. .with his 
claws and teeth. 

A rusty bell started ringing 
somewhere in the castle. 

The jester snorted, sat up 
and looked out of the narrow 
window. Then he lit the can- 
dle and said his prayers, 
kneeling on his bed. Dax 
stretched, and the old man 
cleaned his teeth with a 
splinter and took a draught 
from the ale pot. It had a sour 
stench, but Dax found that he 
no longer minded — there were 
so many conflicting smells 
around, the most interesting 
of which had been the rat. A 
new, more immediately hope- 
ful one, was of cooking that 
drifted up from below. It 
seemed that these people ate 
meat for their breakfast. And 
they liked it early. 

“Come along, Tybalt,” the 
jester said, putting on his 
headdress, and went to the 
door. Dax slipped through 
quickly so as not to get his 
tail caught as the jester closed 
it. They went down the wind- 
ing stairs again. 

At the bottom they came 
upon another cat — a big red 
tom — who on catching sight of 
Dax fluffed his tail and laid 
back his ears, spitting. Dax 
had a momentary impulse to 
see if communication was pos- 
sible with him, but the big cat 
yowled and fled down the 
hallway. 

“Ah, Tybalt,” the old man 
said. “Jesters and cats! Even 
their own kind spits at them !” 

73 



As they got to the kitchen 
Dax saw the two hounds that 
had growled at him the night 
before. He was glad that they 
were now leashed and in the 
charge of a boy in a short 
woolen surcoat. 

But when they saw Dax the 
boy was unable to hold them 
back, and they jerked their 
leashes from his hand and 
came running and barking. 
Dax was terrified. He bolted 
ahead of them along the vault- 
ed corridor and into the Great 
Hall, but came face to face 
with another brace of hounds 
whose ears pricked up at the 
sound. Dax without any con- 
scious thought dodged side- 
ways and ran up the tapestry 
on the wall. 

His sharp claws had good 
foothold on the tough canvas 
backing. But at the top he al- 
most lost his grip, and scarce- 
ly managed to get over onto 
the musicians’ gallery from 
which the tapestry hung. He 
crouched there, trembling, 
while the din below increased. 
He could hear men shouting 
at the dogs, and the jester’s 
voice calling him. He mewed 
loudly for help. 

FTER a while he heard 
the old man’s footsteps on 
the wooden ladder. He was 
picked up and comforted, but 
he was so dizzy with fear that 
he could hardly see. The 
jester seemed to think he was 
calm, and put him on his 
shoulder and went down the 

ladder again* The hounds had 

74 


been taken away. But Dax 
stayed where he was with hi9 
eyes shut, holding on tight. 

“Well, Trice!” Dax opened 
his eyes and saw the lord of 
the manor glowering at the 
jester, and then at him. So 
Trice was the jester’s name. 
An odd one. The Earl stood 
with his hands on his hips and 
seemed irritated rather than 
angry. “What’s this I hear? 
The cat runs at my hounds 
and tries to scratch !” 

“Oh, no, sir,” Trice said. “It 
was the other way! They ran 
at him! Tybalt has never 
scratched !” 

“Scratched or no, I wish 
you’d give him to one of the 
villagers,” the Earl said. “I 
don’t v/ant the hounds upset, 
and Lady Godwina doesn’t 
like cats. Besides, he’ll ruin 
the tapestry.” 

“But, my lord, he catches 
the rats! And he’s my... 
friend.” 

“The dogs catch the rats,’* 
the Earl said shortly. “Give 
him away.” 

“W ell, my lord, the 
mice. .” 

“The red tom gets them.” 

The old man put up a hand 
to Dax protectively. “But, 
noble lord, what would I do 
without my pet?” Dax glanced 
at the tired face next his and 
saw tears in the eyes, but he 
had a determined look. “If he 
cannot stay, I ... I must go, 
too!” 

The Earl opened his eyes 
at this, but he smiled. “I see 
you are loyal, old Trice,” he 

by Stephen Barr 




said. “I hope you are as loyal 
to me !” 

The Earl turned away. 
Trice put Dax on .the floor 
and started back towards the 
kitchens. 

‘Tome, Tybalt,” he said. 
“Or there’ll be none left for 
us.” 

Dax wished he v/ere st i 1 1 on 
the shoulder, and stayed cJose 
to the jester’s feet. Things 
were not going well at all. It 
had become as much a prob- 
lem of survival as of research 
and communication, but when 
they got to the kitchen and 
the hounds were nowhere 
about, he decided that perhaps 
the two problems were inter- 
related. After a meal of scraps 
he felt more secure. Not see- 
ing his master he went to look 
for him in the Great Hall. 

When he got there he saw 
that the Earl and his wife 
and retainers were eating 
boiled meat. He remembered 
that his tutor in Middle Eng- 
lish had said the main meal 
in Medieval times was eaten 
in the morning. The four 
hounds were squabbling over 
bones that were thrown to 
them on the rush-covered flag- 
stones under the trestle- 
board, and didn’t notice him. 
Trice was not to be seen. Af- 
ter a while the boy in the 
woolen surcoat was told to 
take them out. He fastened 
leashes to their collars and 
led them through a large 
doorway in the far wall. Dax 
looked at the Earl: he had a 
fairly intelligent face, and he 
TYBALT 


had shown forbearance to- 
wards Trice, so he thought he 
would make another try. 

The Lady Godwina got up 
unsteadily from her chair and 
left the hall — on the way to 
the lady’s solar, Dax guessed; 
and he padded across to the 
Earl. When he got to the foot 
of the high-backed chair — it 
looked like a detached choir- 
stall from a gothic church — 
he patted the Earl’s foot. 

The Earl looked down at 
him and frowned. 

Dax patted the foot again; 
three times. Then he mewed 
three times, and repeated the 
patting. The Earl blinked and 
got up, backing away. Dax 
mewed three times again, and 
the Earl crossed himself. 

“Saints preserve my soul! 
What have we here?” 

D AX turned around three 
times, getting his hind 
legs crossed and nearly fall- 
ing down. “Send for Trice at 
once !” the Earl shouted. “His 
cat Tybalt has a fit! Careful !” 
he said to a serving man who 
had come forward with out- 
stretched hands. “Take care 
you are not bitten! He is un- 
clean !” 

Dax backed away and ran 
to the open door, and out. 

There was a brilliant sun 
and he could see nothing at 
first — and when he did it was 
blurred, owing to the vertical 
shape of his contracted pupils. 
It was much warmer than the 
night before, and the leaves 
were brown on the trees. 

75 



There was no courtyard and 
gateway, with drawbridge and 
moat beyond, as he had rather 
expected. Instead he was on 
cobblestones, surrounded at 
intervals by small houses, 
with trees between them. The 
village was built against the 
castle, somewhat in the French 
manner, but the houses were 
wretched affairs of mud- 
daubed reeds on wooden fram- 
ing : hardly better than hovels. 
Only a few had more than one 
story. Smoke was coming up 
from every chimney, and the 
men were evidently on their 
way to work in the fields. 
They carried crude-looking 
farm implements and were 
dressed in coarse homespun 
with their legs padded and 
cross-gartered. They were a 
sorry lot : blank-faced and 

half starved. 

Dax heard footsteps behind 
him and turned. 

A young man with blond 
short hair and a Norman nose 
had come out of the doorway. 
He looked at Dax with amused 
curiosity, and squatted down, 
putting out a hand. At this 
proximity his eyes showed 
bloodshot and there was a 
beery smell. He said some- 
thing that Dax could not un- 
derstand — it sounded vaguely 
like a kind of French, but Dax 
had not studied medieval Nor- 
man. Still, it had a kindly 
sound. Dax rubbed against the 
hand. This man, at least, did 
not share the Earl’s diagnosis. 
What was his position in the 
Earl’s household? Not his son 
76 


— he looked too unlike him. 
Would he be his clerk? He 
had a clerkly look — what is it 
in a face that makes it seem 
scholarly ? And his hands 
were more fit for holding a 
pen than a mattock or a sword. 

Well, give it another try. 

Dax wished he could make 
an ingratiating sound, and 
found he was purring. He 
looked around for something 
he could use as a signal ; mew- 
ing and tapping seemed to be 
misunderstood. A few yards 
away the cobblestones gave 
place to dirt, and he started 
towards it. It might do for a 
blackboard. He looked back, 
but the clerk had not moved. 

Dax wondered how a cat 
might beckon, lacking a fore- 
finger. He waited until he 
caught the young man’s eye, 
and tried to beckon with his 
head but it had no results. He 
continued on to the patch of 
dirt and scratched a triangle, 
and to his relief the clerk got 
up and came to him. When he 
was standing over him, Dax 
scratched two words in Latin: 
homo sum , and looked up. 

The clerk was staring with 
his mouth open. 

G OOD, thought Dax: Latin 
was the lingua Franca of 
medieval Europe, and went on 
with his scratching. Humani 
nihil a me alienum — 

There was a gasp and he 
looked up again. The young 
man had closed his eyes and 
had the back of his hand 
against his forehead. He 

by Stephen Barr 



turned and walked to the cas- 
tle door, holding his head. 
Dax sat down in disgust. A 
Twelfth Century hangover, 
indeed! A shadow fell across 
him and he turned. 

Three villagers : two men, 
and a woman in a hood were 
behind him. They had an ex- 
pectant air, and, realizing that 
they were doubtless illiterate, 
he drew a large five-pointed 
star. 

The effect on them was vol- 
canic. 

The woman screeched and 
threw her skirt over her head. 
The men crossed themselves 
and one of them turned and 
ran. The other slashed at Dax 
with a bill-hook and then, 
shouting, “Bewitched! Be- 
witched !” he, too, ran. The 
bill-hook missed Dax, thanks 
to his instinctive leap to one 
side, but the woman continued 
her noise and more people 
came out of the cottages, 
armed with farming imple- 
ments and sticks. Everyone 
was shouting and offering 
advice. The main thread of 
their discourse was: Pos- 

sessed ! Possessed ! Kill it ! 
The Devil Incarnate! 

Dax was hemmed in on 
three sides. He started back 
for the castle, but the big 
doorway was filled with on- 
lookers, one of whom stepped 
forward, aiming a crossbow. 
There was a clank followed 
by a hissing in the air, and 
the bolt thumped into the 
ground next to him. The bow- 
man cursed and began to wind 
TYBALT 


up his bow with a crannikin. 
Dax’s fur stood out all over 
him and he made a mad dash 
towards a group of women 
who had nothing in their 
hands but besoms of birch 
twigs. It was a fortunate 
choice. 

Two or three women made 
abortive swats at him and the 
others backed away, leaving 
a clear path. In front of him 
was an open space and a tall 
tree.. 

Almost before he knew it he 
was near its top and the whole 
village was milling around 
near its base, looking up with 
red angry faces. 

“Fire the tree!” someone 
shouted. 

“T’won’t burn. It’s an elm!” 

“Well, I shan’t climb it !” 

“I won’t have my tree 
burn !” an indignant voice 
yelled, but was drowned out. 
Small children were jumping 
up and down in excitement, 
and some teen-age boys threw 
stones but none of them 
reached him. Dax spat furi- 
ously. Teen-agers were the 
same through the ages! 

“Cut it down, then !” 

“T’will fall on my house !” 
(A woman’s voice.) 

The shouting died down, 
and Dax hung on till his claws 
ached. There seemed to be a 
conference going on. The cas- 
tle appeared to have lost in- 
terest, which relieved him; if 
there was to be any more 
crossbow shooting he stood 
little chance. After a short 
while the subject of the con- 

77 



ference became apparent as 
men began arriving with bun- 
dles of dry sticks and faggots. 

To Dax’s horror these were 
piled about the trunk and set 
alight. Then, as the flames be- 
gan to rise, green boughs were 
added and a thick cloud of 
suffocating smoke came up. 

ESPERATELY he tried 
to find escape. One of the 
elm’s long branches reached 
out almost over the roof of 
one of the houses, but it meant 
climbing down into the heart 
of the choking cloud. Beyond 
the house he suddenly caught 
sight of his master, Trice, 
who waved to him beseeching- 
ly. It gave him courage. Hold- 
ing his breath, he began to 
back down the trunk until he 
felt the branch under him. 
Then he twisted round and 
ran along it with his heart 
pounding. A cat has small 
lungs for its size and holding 
his breath was a torment — but 
at last he was free of the 
smoke, and he took a breath 
of clean air. 

The roof seemed to be with- 
in reach, and the crowd had 
temporarily lost sight of him 
in the smoke. 

He could hear the jester’s 
voice, but for some reason he 
couldn’t understand him — it 
sounded like gibberish. He 
crept out until the thinning 
branch began to bend and, 
just as shouts went up from 
the more observant villagers, 
he leapt. 

He landed on the thatch — 
78 


and almost lost his hold, but 
he was just able to scramble 
to the rooftree, and ran along 
the ridge. There was more 
shouting. Either these ones 
spoke a dialect or the excite- 
ment had put Middle English 
out of his head : he could bare- 
ly understand them. Some- 
thing about Widow Aelthre- 
da’s cottage — something about 
a witch . 

He slithered down the far 
side of the thatching and 
landed on a window box of 
late purple daisies. The parch- 
ment-covered window next 
him was open and he slipped 
inside just as the crowd 
turned the corner. 

He found himself in a 
small, bare upstairs room, in- 
sufficiently lit by the single 
window, but he could easily 
see into the most profound 
shadows. Under a chest in the 
corner was a mouse, frozen 
with terror. Dax was still out 
of breath, but he crept toward 
it, and as it ran out along the 
baseboard he intercepted it. 
He ate it — all. 

As he washed his face he 
wondered with diminishing 
nervousness what all the 
shouting and noise outside 
meant. 

In a little while he heard 
footsteps and a woman came 
into the room. When she saw 
him she made some noises 
with her mouth, and Dax ran 
to her. She picked him up and 
began to stroke him very 
pleasantly. Then there were 
more noises from below and 

by Stephen Barr 




presently there were a lot of 
people in the room. The wom- 
an dropped him for some rea- 
son. 

He ran under a big, low 
wooden thing, but a big iron 
thing was pushed at him. It 
had a sharp point, and he had 
to come out. This time the 
man with the bill-hook did not 
miss, but the pain lasted only 
for an instant. 

And . and . he was more 
conscious of the sound made 
by the hypodermic as it fell 
on the floor and broke. 

He looked at it with an- 
noyance, and felt the slight 
prick on his arm. He got up 
and went to his bathroom, 
where he dabbed it with an- 
tiseptic. He saw that he’d bet- 
ter shave before going to the 
meeting. Well, the drug 
hadn’t worked. What a waste 
of time. What a pity. 

Perhaps a larger dose? He 
must experiment some more. 

He started shaving. 

IV 

W HEN he got to the prin- 
cipal’s office — a little 
Late, which was not entirely 
by accident — he found that 
Mallison and a few of his fel- 
low-students were sitting op- 
posite the desk in hard chairs. 

The principal behind it 
gave Dax a reprimanding 
look, and then one at his 
watch. On one side of him 
were a group of teachers and 
a member of the school board 
who Dax remembered was Mr, 
TYBALT 


Lightstone’s especial crony. 
On the other were Mrs. Light- 
stone— a dour but subservient 
partner to her husband — and 
an empty chair. 

The principal pointed to the 
chair and said, “We have been 
waiting for your arrival to be- 
gin, Mr. Dax.” He turned to 
Mall ison as Dax sat down, and 
said, “You are, I believe, what 
is known as a ‘hep-cat’?” He 
waited but Mallison said noth- 
ing. His face was very white 
and he looked sullen. “Well, 
answer me, sir !” the principal 
said loudly. 

“You didn’t ask me any- 
thing,” the boy said in a low 
voice. “You told me.” 

The principal pushed his 
lips out and breathed deeply. 
He took something from his 
pocket and held it up. Dax 
saw it was the packet of al- 
leged heroin. 

“Did you throw this out of 
the window of Mr. Dax’s class 
room?” 

The boy looked at it incom- 
prehendingly and shook his 
head. 

“Do you know what it is? 
Have you seen this packet be- 
fore?” 

“No, Mr. Lightstone. .” 

“You sound uncertain. 
Think carefully, Mallison.” 
The principal put the packet 
on his desk and unfolded it. 
Everyone bent forward and 
looked at it — including Mal- 
lison, who shook his head 
again. • 

Dax leaned across Mrs. 
Lightstone and whispered to 

79 



her husband, “ Did you have it 
analyzed ?” 

The principal shook his 
head impatiently. “Not yet! 
There was no one in the 
Chemistry Department !” He 
cleared his throat important- 
ly. “Well? What have you to 
say?” 

Mallison apparently had 
nothing to say. He swallowed 
and looked at one of the boys 
next him. Mr. Lightstone 
leaned back in his chair and 
turned to address the group 
on his right — the school board 
man in particular., “This,” he 
said, tapping the packet, “was 
thrown out of a window of 
the physics class room today. 
These are the bo}'s that sit 
next those windows. I have 
every reason to suspect Mal- 
lison.” 

The group nodded. Dax 
realized that they had been 
briefed in advance. The boy 
Mallison had certainly a sulky 
and uncooperative air. He 
seemed the epitome of juve- 
nile delinquency on the de- 
fensive, and yet... 

the principal said 
to the boys, “are a little 
band of trouble-makers. You 
cut classes, you stay up late 
and go to what I believe you 
call juke-joints. I have heard 
reports of your riding in hot- 
rods!” He paused significant- 

iy- 

“None of us here’s got a 
car,” Mallison said in a flat 
voice. He was definitely 
sneering now. “I’ve never 

80 


even seen a real drag-race!” 
Mr. Lightstone blinked. 
The word was unfamiliar to 
him, but it had a disreputable 
ring to it. “And I suppose 
you’ve never taken narcotics?” 
There was a dead silence. 
Mallison clamped his mouth 
shut, and his face became 
wooden. 

Mr. Lightstone addressed 
the boy next him. “Have you 
ever seen any of the boys use 
this?” He tapped the packet 
again. “Did you see Mallison 
throw it out of the window? 
You* sit behind him!” 

The boy looked blank and 
glanced at Mallison. “No, sir,” 
he said. 

“But you couldn’t have 
missed seeing him!” 

“Excuse me a minute,” Dax 
said. “These boys aren’t a 
band exactly. They just hap- 
pen to sit next the windows.” 
Mr. Lightstone looked of- 
fended but resourceful. “They 
picked those seats themselves. 
That’s what a clique does. 
It — ” 

“I assign all the pupils to 
their desks,” Dax said, and 
felt he was turning pink. 

The principal took this in 
his stride by ignoring it. “And 
you,” he said to the boy on 
Mallison’s other side. “What 
have you to say?” 

The boy frowned and stut- 
tered. 

Dax was beginning to feel 
annoyed although he didn’t 
know exactly why. For one 
thing, he had let himself seem 
to be defending Mallison. It 

by Stephen Barr 



was his craze for accuracy, of 
course. “ I don’t understand 
why the parents of these boys 
aren’t here,” he was surprised 
to hear himself say. “It seems 
to me they ought to have some 
kind of defense counsel if 
there is going to be a trial.” 
The principal looked at him 
steadily. “Would you care to 
act in that capacity?” 

Dax felt that he was getting 
redder than ever. “Have you 
had a doctor examine Malli- 
son for... for the effects of 
narcotics?” he said. “Where 
are these policemen you said 
you spoke to? Shouldn’t they 
be informed of your suspi- 
cions, instead of holding a 
kind of star chamber inquisi- 
tion? It’s... it’s medieval V* 

Mr. Lightstone glared at 
him in astonishment. 

Dax had a sudden thought. 
“The chemistry lab is right 
over my class room,” he said. 
“Why couldn’t the packet 
have fallen from there?” 
“What would they be doing 
with heroin?” 

“But we don’t know yet 
that—” 

The principal interrupted 
him and swept his arm in a 
gesture of all-inclusive con- 
demnation. “We will in good 
time ! But if you have never 
seen guilt before, you see it 
now!” He looked at the star- 
tled young faces with abhor- 
rence. “Look at them!” 

]T|AX had a curious and vi- 
^ olent revulsion, although 
he hadn’t followed the line of 

TYBALT 


reasoning in Lightstone’s last 
remark. In fact, he realized 
that he hadn’t really heard the 
words. But the principal’s an- 
gry face made his hackles 
rise. 

✓ The principal had a menac- 
ing look. He was the most 
dangerous looking thing he 
had ever seen. A convulsive 
shudder went through all of 
Dax’s muscles, and he leapt — 
straight across Mrs. Light- 
stone’s lap, who fell over 
backwards, screaming. Every- 
one was making loud, garbled 
noises, and he was on top of 
Lightstone, scratching and 
biting. 

He heard himself give a 
loud, warlike and triumphant 
yowl. END

It’s not so bad, being on trial for murder. 
Of course, It's a little embarrassing — 
when the principal witness is the corpse! 


THE HAPPY +« 

HOMICIDE 

BY FRANK BANTA 


TTENDANTS pushing an 
ambulance cot wheeled 
what was left of murdered 
Fannie Bork into the center 
of the courtroom. The body 
was covered with a white 
sheet, except for the long, 
slim feet which were sticking 
out. Her toenails were paint- 
ed red. 

Forty-year-old John Bork 
listened while the prosecutor 
read the indictment against 
him: “ — and the same John 
Bork did on the twelfth day 
of March, 1986, fire a pistol 
at his wife, having then and 
there a long preconceived de- 
sire to kill her, and then and 
there did achieve his feloni- 
ous intent, and did murder 
the same Fannie Bork.” 

“John Bork, you have heard 


the indictment,” stated the 
judge formally. “How do you 
wish to plead: Not guilty, no 
contest, or wait and see?” 

“I’ll wait and see, your 
honor.” 

“I thought you would,” 
sighed the judge. “We 
haven’t had a straight not- 
guilty plea in ages. Proceed, 
Mr. Prosecutor.” 

“Roll in the Very Compli- 
cated Monstrous Proximila- 
tor machine,” commanded the 
prosecutor. Two burly labor- 
ers, panting, rolled the ma- 
chine on its creaky casters 
across the court room floor to 
Fannie’s head. The machine 
was six feet tall, three feet 
wide, and twelve inches deep; 
on its face were forty-three 
meters and an on/off switch. 



82 



The laborers plugged the 
machine’s line cord into an 
outlet and got out of the way. 

T HE prosecutor flipped the 
switch from off to on. 
Then he folded his arms and 
waited until all the forty- 
three meters ceased their 
dancing and went back to 
zero. That done, he turned to 
the jury. 

“In this machine rests the 
proof of the crime charged 
against the defendant,” he 
said dramatically, patting the 
smooth gray side of the ma- 
chine. “This machine will tell 
you all you need to know 
about the murder. Oh, to be 
sure, I shall show you the 
corpus delicti presently ; but 
why and how this crime was 
committed shall be revealed 
only by this machine’s stimu- 
lation of the deceased’s brain. 
She will herself relate who 
her killer was!” 

There was a shocked gasp 
from the jurors and the spec- 
tators in the court room when 
the prosecutor pulled back 
the sheet from the body, un- 
covering her head and chest. 
“The jury will note that the 
government has removed her 
skull down to her eyebrows 
so that we could contact her 
brain’s recordings with the 
machine’s probe. The jury 
will also note the four bullet 
holes in the deceased’s chest, 
which we intend to prove 
were put there by John Bork.’’ 
“I missed twice,” said John 
Bork, nodding. 

THE HAPPY HOMICIDE 


“Silence!” shouted the sud- 
denly enraged judge. “This 
court depends entirely on the 
Very Complicated Monstrous 
Proximilator machine for its 
evidence.” He turned to the 
jurj', still seething. “The jury 
will completely disregard the 
defendant’s utterly uncaFed- 
for admission. Proceed, Mr. 
Prosecutor.” 

The prosecutor fastened the 
ground cable of the machine 
to Fannie’s big toe by means 
of an immense alligator 
clamp. Then taking the bul- 
bous radio-frequency probe in 
his hand he said portentous- 
ly, “Now we shall search for 
the memory-recording of Fan- 
nie Bork’s moment of death!” 

He torched her brain light- 
ly with the probe. 

Th ose seeing it for the first 
time were chilled by the read 
body's sudden animation. 

“Oh, Winston!” cooed dead 
Fannie Bork, her arms rais- 
ing from the cot to embrace 
an invisible something. She 
kissed. “You tastes good!” 

The prosecutor moved the 
probe. 

“George?” called Fannie, 
her slim arms searching at the 
side of her cot. “I didn’t hear 
you leave, George.” She re- 
laxed. “Oh, I hope he found 
his shoes.” 

“He didn’t though,” con- 
tributed John Bork. 

The prosecutor moved the 
probe, hurrying on by erno- 
tion-stirred quavers: Angelo, 
Moose. JTaudie, Beacon and 
Quasimodo. 

83 



“Speed, darlin’, what’s your 
hurry ?” asked Fannie in her 
plaintive, metallic voice as she 
held out her hands beseech- 
ingly. 

“I never got to know him 
very well,” interjected John 
Bork. “His visits were all so 
short.” 

The prosecutor moved his 
probe. 

“Bork! Bork!” 

“Ah,” said the prosecutor. 
“Now we are getting down to 
cases. I shall try that spot 
again.” 

“Bork! Bork!” 

“She’s not calling for me,” 
advised Bork. “She just had 
a cold that week.” 

T HE prosecutor moved his 
probe. At each touch, the 
body broke into quaking ac- 
tion: Ferdinand, Frenchy, Ya- 
cob; Peyton, Rebel, Young 
foo Yum; and John. 

“Ah !” said the prosecutor. 
“Here we are now.” 

“John!” whispered Fannie. 
“John, John, John! Oh, John- 
ny Johnson, my love! Stay 
here forever!” 

“Wife’s other John,” said 
John Bork succinctly. 

The prosecutor moved his 
probe: Sinclair, Henrik, Sit- 
ting Duck, Oscar, Kenny, and 
Aqueduct. 

“That Aqueduct is Sitting 
Duck's educated b r o t h e r,” 
confided John Bork. “Before 
he went to Princeton his name 
was Wet Duck.” 

The prosecutor moved his 
probe : Pease, Reese and 

84 


Meese, Acuff, Eyolf and Beo- 
wulf; Bork! Bork! 

“That cough again?” mut- 
tered the prosecutor, ready to 
move on. 

“No, she’s calling for me 
that time,” corrected Bork. 

“How can you tell?” 

“It has more of a snarl in it 
than her cough has.” 

The prosecutor tried the 
spot once more. 

“Bork! Bork! Why are you 
pointing that at me, Bork? 
What are you going to do, 
Bork?” She held out her 
hands to ward him off. “Oh! 
Oh! Oh! Oh!” Then she 
dropped her hands. 

“I missed twice,” John said, 
nodding. 

“The defendant will keep 
his lousy confessions to him- 
self!” shrieked the judge. “I 
will not have the importance 
of our Very Complicated 
Monstrous Proximilator ma- 
chine vitiated by these un- 
wanted confessions!” 

Bork shrugged. “I just 
wanted to clear up a couple 
of details, your honor. I just 
like to be tidy.” 

“We don’t need your help,” 
responded the judge crush- 
ingly. “The Very Complicated 
Monstrous Proximilator ma- 
chine tells us all we want to 
know.” He turned to the 
prosecutor. “You may pro- 
ceed.” 

“The state rests.” 

B ORK’S lawyer advised the 
court that no defense 
would be presented. The 

FRANK BANTA 



prosecutor exhorted the jury 
that its duty was plain. The 
judge gave final instructions, 
and the jury filed out. It re- 
turned in four minutes. 

“Gentlemen of the jury, 
have you reached a verdict in 
such a gratifyingly short 
space of time?” the judgei 
asked, beaming. 

The foreman arose. “We 
have, your honor.” 

“Just for the record, what 
is your verdict?” twinkled the 
judge. 

“Not guilty, your honor.” 

The prosecutor jumped up. 
“Why, that can’t be !” he 
shouted. “It’s a prima facie 
case, unrefuted and therefore 
patent. What else do you 
need?” 

“Yeah!” agreed the judge, 
outraged. 

“We need some p 7 am, old- 
fashioned evidence of a 
crime,” answered the jury- 
man, unperturbed. 

“Old-fashioned?” The fum- 
ing prosecutor rejected the 
heresy, pushing it away from 
him with both hands. “This 
is all unscientific now,” he 
warned. “The Very Compli- 
cated Monstrous Proximilator 
machine — especially the new 
model with the forty-three 


meters which replaces the old 
thirty-nine meter machine — is 
the ne plus ultra of justice!” 

“Oh, no, it isn’t,” dissented 
the foreman. “Did your evi- 
dence place the deadly weap- 
on in the defendant’s hand? 
Did your evidence even tend 
to show the holes in the wom- 
an’s chest were made by a gun? 
She said nothing about a 
weapon, if you will recall. 
She~ merely said, ‘Why are 
you pointing that at me, 
Bork? What are you going to 
do, Fork?’” 

“But he had plenty of mo- 
tive,” pleaded the prosecutor. 

“Oh, we’ll go along with 
that” assented the foreman. 

“And the defendant admit- 
ted it!” pursued the prosecu- 
tor triumphantly. 

The foreman shook his 
head. “Admissions don’t 
count. The judge said so him- 
self.” 

“So even though you know 
he’s guilty,” the prosecutor 
said hollowly, “you’re going 
to let him go?” 

“That’s right,” agreed the 
foreman happily, and cleared 
his throat. “We, the jury,” he 
pronounced, “find this fellow 
innocent of what he did !”

IF • Feature 



S PEAKING of the weather, 
which of course someone 
just was or shortly will (and 
by the way, it was not Mark 
Twain who said . .but no- 
body does anything about it”) 
here are a couple of things you 
are quite sure of that just ain’t 
so: First, that rainfall is 

caused exclusively by the 
shifts in highs and lows and 
all the other things the pretty 
girls on TV tell you about. 
The Australian physicist Ed- 
ward G. Bowen got the idea 
that maybe space dust filter- 
ing down can seed clouds the 
way man does occasionally 
with silver iodide. Chasing his 
guess, he went over all the 
records he could get his hands 
on, and sure enough r ound 
that the entire Earth has al- 


most simultaneous peaks of 
precipitation at certain times 
— and in more cases than coin- 
cidence could arrange, these 
times were almost exactly 30 
days after the Earth had 
passed through known meteor 
swarms. Second: We all know 
that the Earth is warming up, 
very probably due to the 
“greenhouse effect” caused by 
us and our factories, exhaling 
vast amounts of C02 into the 
atmosphere. Well, in a sym- 
posium in Rome recently, Cli- 
matologist J. Murray Mitchell 
announced his conclusion that 
the climate ended a v/arming 
period some 20 years ago and 
is now cooling again. The 
mean temperature over 80% of 
the earth has gone down, in 
that time, half a degree Fahr- 


86 


enheit. The U.S., Western 
Europe and the Pacific coast 
of Asia are the exceptions. 

Isoniazid, the miraculous con- 
queror of TB, can prevent as 
well as cure the disease. Plans 
are afoot to try it in certain 
high-incidence areas. If it 
works, a condition may be 
reached in which the bacillus, 
wherever it exists, will simply 
have nowhere to go, and the 
disease will cease to exist. Al- 
ready TB, once the No. 1 kill- 
er, is down to fourteenth. 

A resounding salute to Mr. 
Clearborn Parker of Ft. 
Worth. Suffering from a con- 
dition known as hemochroma- 
tosis, Mr. Parker had to sub- 
mit to a long series of phlebot- 
omies — the bit-by-bit with- 
drawal of his blood. He may 
need up to a hundred of these. 
His doctors (at the Carter 
Blood Center in Ft. Worth) 
discovered that Mr. Parker 
was a walking treasure-house: 
his blood contained a rare se- 
rum which can be used to do 
Rh blood typing. He has this 
serum, called anti-D, due to 
having been given the wrong 
blood in a transfusion some 
years ago. The doctors told 
him that if he would submit to 
small transfusion of more of 
this “wrong” blood, his out- 
put of anti-D would be much 
increased, but that it could be 
unpleasant, even dangerous, 
and, possibly, deadly. The 51- 
year-old Parker just grinned 
and told them to go ahead. Be- 

SCIENCE BRIEFS 


cause of this, it is estimated 
that he will produce enough 
anti-D to do 8 million Rh 
blood-clumping tests. And he 
refused to take any pay. 

All we can say is — thanks. 

Electrical storms seem to af- 
fect mental patients. During a 
period of frequent atmospher- 
ic electrical disturbance, ad- 
missions to mental hospitals 
increase, and the patients are 
more difficult to deal with. 
The exact function of electri- 
cal currents in the nervous 
system has yet to be complete- 
ly understood. It is known, 
however, that there is a nor- 
mal fluctuation of small dc 
voltages in the body, fluctua- 
tions which increase very no- 
ticeably in the mentally ill.

In a recent statement, James 
E. Webb, administrator of the 
National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration, listed 
four good reasons why the 
U. S. should press ahead into 
space. 1. We cannot tolerate 
any gap between our space 
technology and that of the 
Russians, as it is possible for 
the leading nation to reach a 
degree of advance which 
would make it uncatchable : it 
would make too many further 
gains by virtue of its superior 
equipment and skills. 2. Space 
research has the virtue of cut- 
ting across many different 
scientific disciplines, causing 
a massive cross-pollination 
from which everyone benefits. 
3. We must hurry ahead for 


87 



reasons of prestige. This is 
not merely an emotional, or 
even a political matter. In the 
forefront, we are in a much 
better position to give and get 
information from all nations, 
large and small. 4. Satellite 
technology promises early and 
heavy cash returns through its 
immense impact on the com- 
munications industry and 
weather forecasting. 

Another of sf’s old-timers, the 
space station, will come true. 
Project Apollo, the manned, 
soft-landing moon shot, would 
require a monstrous multi- 
stage liquid-fuel rocket stand- 
ing nearly 400 feet tall, and 
would have to supply 
12,000,000 lbs. of thrust at 
takeoff. Alternatively, a Nova 
rocket carrying the Apollo 
capsule would be boosted by 
a cluster of 8 F-l engines, a 
million and a half pounds of 
thrust each; or a dozen solid- 
fuel boosters totalling 20 mil- 
lion lbs. of push. It looks very 
much as if these plans will be 
dropped in favor of an ad- 
vanced Saturn which will car- 
ry fuel up and put it in orbit. 
The Nova will then rendez- 
vous with it, refuel, and head 
for the moon. 

Enter Aquaculture, which is 
neither farming nor fishing 
but something in between. 
Dean Charles J. Fish of the 
School of Oceanography in 
Rhode Island is making ex- 
haustive study of salt ponds 
— seaside ponds cut off from 
88 


the ocean by sand-bars and 
other such slight barriers. For 
a long time regarded as use- 
less except for garbage dumps, 
these ponds turn out to be 
very important and filled with 
potentials. Dr. Fish points out 
that Narragansett Bay gives 
several times the yield of sea- 
food than can be taken from 
the neighboring bay, Buz- 
zard’s on Cape Cod. The rea- 
son, he says, is the great num- 
ber of salt ponds around the 
Narragansett beaches. They 
act as nurseries for vegetable 
and animal life on which fish 
feed. A quarter-million dol- 
lars from the National Insti- 
tute of Health finances the 
pond study, which may result 
in a new industry, the “farm- 
ing” of shallow water, and a 
great new source of food. 

Amherst's Prof. J. W. Daven- 
port has completed an “all- 
purpose” psychology lab, con- 
sisting of a central control 
room and sixteen private cubi- 
cles each of which is large 
enough for two students and 
a patient or animal subject. 
An instructor can survey the 
entire proceedings one by one 
or all at once, by closed-cir- 
cuit TV ; or he can share the 
experiment in any one room 
with all the others. Prof. Da- 
venport designed the facility 
and built it with students on 
a do-it-yourself basis. The re- 
sult is $6500 worth of materi- 
als turned into a $40,000 lab. 
That, friend, is using psychol- 
ogy ! END

F IRST man to reach the 
speed of light, I was. But 
you’ll find the good Albert 
only hinted at the effects, in 
a delta-theta 2.3 pi-squared 
way. Ez=mc 2 , he said. And for 
fifty years before they built 
my rocket, the Lighttrick , 
slim, tapering, sleek and gy- 
perpowered, everyone concen- 
trated on turning matter into 
energy at a light-squared pow- 
er. Big, bright bangs, and con- 
gratulations. 

It’s a pity no one asked 
what happens to energy di- 
vided by the speed of light. 
I happen to be the answer to 
the equation, and by interfer- 
ing with the motor of this 
electric typescripter I can 
give you my thoughts on the 
matter. 

The Lighttrick hit full 
velocity out there between 
Van Allen and the asteroids. 


I’d guess the whole beautiful 
ship, including me, converted 
into energy and, slowing 
down, reconverted on the 
wrong side, so to speak. And 
there I was, floating without 
a ship and surrounded by lit- 
tle round beings, shimmering 
in a blue haze. 

“Good afternoon,” I said. 

But no sound came out of 
my mouth. I had a mouth, in 
a way, but not for talking ; 
and not at all the sort of 
mouth I used to have. In fact, 
the shimmering blue haze was 
me. I could find no other 
parts of me. And when the 
little round things touched 
me on the periphery, there 
was an intelligent vibration. 

“Frequency and tone?” said 
the vibration. “Please identi- 

fy.” 

“You must take me as you 
find me,” I thought. 


89 




“Unidentified frequencies 
and discordant tones request- 
ed not to wander in space- 
ways/’ vibrated the little 
round things. 

“I’m a man,” I vibrated back. 
“We don’t have frequencies. 
We use frequencies in radio, 
television, radar and so on.” 

“Not intelligible.” 

“Where’s my ship?” 
“Ship?” 

I tried to picture the Light- 
trick and the long thin gleam 
on her hull, the fury of her 
rockets and the calm ordered 
keyboard of the control pan- 
els. 

“Most interesting,” vibrated 
the round things. “Poetic. 
Very creative. Speculative 
philosopher, yes?” 

r T" 7 HEY seemed to be grasp- 
A ing the general idea, so I 
concentrated on an image of 
myself, square and bearded, 
staring sternly into space 
through the ports, in a pioneer 
manner, observing hitherto 
unknown planets. 

“Most ingenious,” my audi- 
ence vibrated back. “But un- 
likely.” 

Then they started vibrating 
among themselves. 

“Senior e minus says...” 

“Mush is mush, that’s what 
I say.” 

“Now, theoretically. .” 

“I don’t vibrate why not. 
There are more things in 
positive and negative, Hora- 
tio, than. .” 

“Excuse me,” I vibrated. 

' I. 

^here was a brief pause. 

90 


“Perhaps we should illu- 
minate.” 

“Please do,” I vibrated po- 
litely. 

They gathered round the 
edges of my haze and ex- 
plained. It seemed a very sen- 
nior e had suggested once that 
there might, just might, theo- 
retically be side-effects of 
mush. The little round thin gs 
were e beings. And “mush” 
was the accepted term for the 
static and orbital tracks of 
electrons in fixed patterns, 
such as one found here and 
there in space. But the very 
senior e, apparently, had spec- 
ulated that in a certain nar- 
row band of light frequencies 
mush might possibly give an 
app earance of “matter” — to 
coin a word — a kind of con- 
densed or crystalline energy. 

“But no one,” they vibrated, 
“ever suggested there might 
be forms of life based on such 
‘material’ structures. We ad- 
mire your imagination. Hail 
bright e! All hail.” 

A rapid circuit of my haze 
failed to show anyone else 
that they might be vibrating 
to. 

“Do you mean me?” I in- 
quired. 

“Naturally. Hail, bright e !” 

“I’m an e?” 

“What else?” 

“Very well,” I thought. 
“Perhaps you’ll tell me what 
an e is.” 

“An e? We are all e beings.” 

“So you mentioned earlier. 
But what is an e being?” 

“Ah, you are too deep for 

by James Stainers 



us. Highly original philos- 
opher, yes.. But please get off 
the spaceway. There is a food 
flood due/' 

And they edged me firmly 
down, and down, to a vast 
doughnut with a hole in the 
center. 

I ate a piece out of habit. 
It was insipid and tasteless. 
But then, a doughnut several 
thousand miles across must 
have some drawbacks. 

“The pasture is better in- 
side," they vibrated. 

So I sank down into the 
enormous piece of pastry and 
came out of a couple of inner 
layers to see a big ball of 
mush. There was no mistak- 
ing it. A vast, tangled, inter- 
connecting mass of tiny points 
of light. Mush was a good 
name for it. But here and there 
on its surface were great riv- 
ers of liquor and mounds of 
food in delectable variety. 

I stuffed myself for days, 
browsing here and there 
across the surface of the globe 
of mush. 

In fact, I was chewing qui- 
etly on an apparently endless 
streaming ribbon of — well — 
trout, steak, caviar, you-name- 
your-favorite food; that’s 
what it was to me. And I hap- 
pened to bite too deeply. 
There was a core of this mush 
stuff inside and, when I bit 
it, the whole food supply 
stopped. The stream of en- 
trancing food just disap- 
peared. 

And there I was, hov- 
ering on a plain of bare mush, 

E BEING 


I was brooding on this and 
belching contentedly with a 
sort of cracking noise, when 
the skeleton came driving 
over the surface of the mush 
ball. It was in a framework 
of mush shaped like a jeep 
but squirting delicious little 
fountains of liquor in the 
front, where the engine of a 
real jeep would have been. I 
moved over and tasted them. 
And the whole framework 
stopped. 

“Triple purple hell," said a 
voice. “The damned thing's 
broken down again. Wait till 
I get my hands on that idiot 
mechanic !’’ 

“Hey," I vibrated. “Where 
are you?" 

“Now I’ll have to walk all 
the way back, I suppose," the 
voice added. 

The skeleton got out of the 
mush jeep, walked through me 
and lifted the hood. 

“Battery flat," the voice 
said disgustedly. “Not a drop 
of juice in it." 

I began to feel guilty. 
There was a slight blue base 
round the skeleton’s head. 
When I examined it more 
closely, it looked less like a 
skeleton of bare bones and 
more like a physician’s chart 
of the human nervous system, 
traced out in thin lines of 
mush... little close-packed 
lines of energy, fixed in rela- 
tion to each other but flexible 
as a whole. 

It occurred to me I was 
looking at a human being, in 
terms of energy. 

91 



And I had just drunk his 
jeep’s ignition! 

So thought was a form of 
energy, after all. For some of 
the things he was thinking 
about the mechanic responsible 
for maintaining the jeep were 
strictly subliminal and Freu- 
dian. If he spoke, I doubted 
if I would hear him. His voice 
would just be a very faint 
wave of mush traveling indis- 
tinctly out. 

“And the next time that 
spark-spark foreman sends me 
out on an emergency power- 
line repair,” continued the 
skeleton, “he can spark-spark 
well give me a vehicle that 
’ works /” 

The skeleton’s name was 
Joe, I think. And I watched 
Joe sway over to the ribbon 
of mush I had bitten through. 

“Fused,” Joe muttered in 
his head. “Now, what on Earth 
did that?” 

And it struck me for the 
first time where I was. Back 
on Earth! As an e being! A 
being based, it seemed, on en- 
ergy and not on matter. Con- 
verted accidentally by the 
marvels of modern science and 
the supreme technological 
achievement of traveling at 
the speed of light. 

I spat disgustedly at the 
thought. 

“Summer lightning?” Joe 
bent his mush head back and 
looked up. He exposed a rath- 
er interesting tidbit in the re- 
gion of his throat plexus and 
his cardiac nerves were, I re- 
gret to say, for an instant very 
92 


appetizing. But I controlled 
myself. 

After all, in a technological 
society as free with energy as 
ours ... as yours . there were 
bound to be ample food and 
drink flowing about. 

I swear I had come to that 
ethical conclusion. It wasn’t 
my fault that I was unfamiliar 
with my own reactions as an e 
being, i didn’t know I was so 
fast. I ate Joe by mistake. I 
just drained off the energy of 
his system before I knew it. 
Truly. 

W ELL, naturally I was sor- 
ry about it. In fact, I was 
just standing there, looking at 
the huddled pile of mush, 
when the other repair crew ar- 
rived. From their scrambled 
thoughts of death and radio 
and Main Office, I gathered 
they were sending for a doc- 
tor. Sure enough, he arrived 
in an autojet with delicious 
after-burners. 

So then they had to send 
for a team of towing tractors. 
I just couldn’t help thinking 
about the ignition systems of 
their vehicles; and to think 
is to eat, with an e. Or rath- 
er, if you have the speed of 
light — as an e being has — it 
takes some time before you 
learn to control your reactions 
quickly enough. 

“Well, I don’t know what’s 
going on around here,” said a 
voice which I located as the 
doctor thinking to himself. 
“But I remember Professor 
Bigglesby’s advice. When you 

by James Stamers 



don’t know, nod thoughtful- 
ly.” 

I could see his mush head 
and its blue haze wobbling sol- 
emnly at the other mush-men. 
I beg your pardon — at the oth- 
er humans. 

“Nervous collapse,” the doc- 
tor continued in his head. 
“Something to do v/ith elec- 
tricity, I suppose. Powerline 
failure. Broken cable. Dead re- 
pair man. Don’t know much 
about electricity. Who does? 
Hello, hello, what’s this?” 

I saw him bend his nervous 
skeleton over Joe’s body and 
straighten up with a string of 
little silver heads sticking to 
his hand. 

“Makes a noise. Quite musi- 
cal. Adheres to skin. Light. 
What is it?” 

“There’s some more of that 
stuff in the jeep engine,” one 
of the repair crew noticed. 

“And on the doc’s jets...” 

“And in our truck...” 

I watched and gathered I 
was leaving some form of con- 
version product around the 
place. I didn’t like that 
thought. If an e being eats en- 
ergy as food and drink, what 
does an e being’s conversion 
product make? The answer 
might be important. .consid- 
ering I had just eaten some- 
one. 

I decided to follow along. 
The doctor was wiping the sil- 
ver beads off his hands into 
something shaped like a glass 
jar and screwing on a lid. I 
thought I had better be around 
when it was examined. 

E BEING 


So I rolled after the towing 
tractors and carefully re- 
frained from even thinking of 
their refreshing little spark- 
plugs and tasty exhaust. 

I followed the doctor until 
we reached a place where 
the mush grew up in blocks 
on either side, square and 
close-meshed, with streams, 
rivers and trickling lines of 
energy tumbling through their 
structures. I gathered we had 
reached a city of some sort. 

The doctor-skeleton got out 
of the tractor and went into 
one of the tall blocks of mush 
through a hole. I followed, 
nibbling a light bulb or two 
as we passed down the long 
corridor inside. The doctor, 
still carrying the jar shape, 
stopped once or twice- and 
looked back, then he shot in 
through a doorway on the left. 

“Dr. McPherson,” thought a 
thin skeleton by the window. 

“I don’t want to say it,” 
said the doctor’s mush head, 
“but this jar of muck seems 
to have put the corridor lights 
out.” 

He held out the jar and I 
saw a faint wave of mush 
spreading from his mouth to- 
ward the thin skeleton. When 
the mush wave reached him, 
the thin man jerked in plain 
disbelief. 

“If I heard that straight, 
either Doc McPherson is 
drunk or he’s got something 
very interesting. I wonder 
which.” 

The thin man wandered 

93 










casually over to the jar the 
doctor was holding and took 
it. 

‘"Not drunk, 1 ” he consid- 
ered, holding the jar up in the 
air. “But...” 

And then his thoughts ran 
riot in a stream of edibles. He 
was thinking of electronics, 
protons, ions, electrons, gam- 
ma, delta and alpha particles, 
and I couldn’t resist it. I’m 
sorry. I just had to eat him, 
his thoughts were so delicious. 

Doctor McPherson stared 
down at the thin body on the 
floor and walked out of the 
room. He left the jar where it 
had rolled on the floor of 
mush. 

I was quite happy. It must 
have been a laboratory of some 
sort. There were refreshing 
sources all over the room. 

I was still tasting and test- 
ing here and there when the 
doctor returned with another 
pair of mush-men — humans, 
I mean — and they had a long 
conversation in their heads 
about the late scientist and 
the contents of the jar. Final- 
ly, they picked up the jar with 
a long rod of static energy — 
some metal, I suppose. They 
took it away. 

Unfortunately, this time it 
seems I had eaten a physicist 
working for the government. 
More and more mush shapes 
of humans clustered round 
Doctor McPherson, and one 
came hurrying up from anoth- 
er laboratory. 

“Raw ozone,” he thought as 
he came. “This fellow needs 

E BEING 


watching. Couldn’t get ozone 
like that except in space. And 
now he happens to be around 
when we lose our top physi- 
cist. And that’s the second ac- 
cident of the day. Yes, sir , 
this McPherson needs watch- 
ing! You can never tell where 
sabotage will break out.” 

He grasped the doctor’s arm 
and said something in a faint 
wave of mush that I could not 
see clearly enough to under- 
stand. 

“Me? Ridiculous! I was 
just...” thought McPherson. 
But he shrugged and turned 
away. 

Well, I couldn’t leave him 
in a mess like that, so I fol- 
lowed Doctor McPherson 
home. 

I had to explain. But how? 

And there was the problem. 
How can a being based on en- 
ergy, like me, communicate 
with a being based on matter, 
like him? 

Obviously, I had to signal 
in some way, give some signs 
of life that would be intelli- 
gible to him. 

He was sitting in a chair- 
shape of strand energy inter- 
woven together, and he was 
thinking gloomy thoughts. He 
flicked on the televiewer. And 
there was the answer. 

T found the input flow, fol- 

lowed it into the cathode 
tube and ate the pictures off 
the screen in a discriminating 
manner. 

They were too small and 
scattered to make a mouthful, 

95 



but that wasn't the point. I 
was able to signal to him ! I 
ate pieces of the picture com- 
ing through and left regular 
black holes on the tube face, 
dot, dash, dash-dash-dot. 

Doctor McPherson stood up, 
approached the set, reached in 
his pocket for a bottle and 
took two pills. And then he 
switched off the set and went 
to bed. 

“Now my eyes are playing 
up. Live r,” his thoughts 
trailed away. 

After awhile, I saw a better 
answer. One man would be 
scared to do anything even if 
I did get in touch with him. 
What I needed was a larger 
scale. If several dozen mush 
. .several dozen people start- 
ed speculating about me, they 
would lend each other moral 
support and they would start 
looking for my signs. Then I 
could tell them all about the 
little error of appetite. 

So I went back down the 
main power line from Doc- 
tor McPherson’s home — high 
grade, pure liquor in that line ! 
— and tracked it upstream to 
the city power house. But 
when I took a deep bite, all 
the generators stopped and an 
auxiliary circuit from some- 
where else started up. 

I ate a piece of main coil 
Li disgust. 

Well, that was no use. And 
then I remembered the little e 
beings’ comments on a food 
flood due in the spaceway. A 
sunburst, no doubt. A mag- 
netic storm on the sun would 
96 


certainly send a harvest out 
through space for e beings. 
But it would louse up the 
planetary radio system. 

And there I had an answer. 
All I had to do was remove 
the radio interference in a 
planned way and every receiv- 
er on half the world would 
receive my signals. How easy 
it was! 

So I went back up to the 
first layer of the doughnut 
round the Earth where there 
was a field of fresh energy. 
As the food came flooding in 
from the sun I gobbled it up. 
Mouthful. Pause. Mouthful, 
mouthful. Pause. Mouthful, 
mouthful, mouthful. Pause. 

I worked up and down the 
numbers in progression, swal- 
lowing every lump of solar 
radiation within reach. 

But I guess I was carried 
away by the enjoyable eating. 
A lot more time passed than 
I had intended; and when I 
came down again to read a 
few thoughts, the world was 
freezing in parts, and the sea 
was boiling in others, and the 
mush lay flat as a desert in 
wide patches. 

I worked it out, eventually. 
No energy means no evapora- 
tion, thus no clouds and no 
rain for vegetation. And that 
means no carbon dioxide lay- 
er to protect the planet, in 
turn leading to excessive ra- 
diation when I stopped eating, 
hence deserts and a boiling 
ocean and parts of the land 
frozen solid. 

Not a very good message. 

by James Stamers 



W ELL, I cleaned up as best 
I could, but it was 
drudgery sipping up the dull, 
flat-tasting thermal energy of 
the oceans. Tidal forces and 
magnetic flows are stodgy, 
uninteresting diets. You might 
as well eat straight mush. 

I decided not to try that 
again. It had too many reper- 
cussions. What I wanted was 
a nice simple signal. 

A volcano would do excel- 
lently, I thought — I n d i a n 
smoke signals on a vast scale. 

So I hunted over the mush 
until I came to a reasonably 
active fountain, probably Ve- 
suvius but I’m not sure ; one 
blob of mush looks like an- 
other. And I drank the whole 
internal fire in bursts. Anyone 
with any sense could have 
seen the Morse-coded erup- 
tions that I let go through. 
But they didn’t. 

They missed my signals al- 
together. Chiefly because I 
had disturbed the balance of 
stresses down at the foot of 
the volcano, deep in the mush, 
and when I came out it was 
dancing about in ripples and 
shakes. I don’t suppose many 
people would stop in the mid- 
dle of an earthquake to note 
the signals coming out of the 
local volcano. Anyway, no one 
did. 

As you know, the damage 
was quite widespread. So I 
went round to the other side 
of the mush, where they v/ere 
less distracted. What I need- 
ed was a test-piece. Something 
whi’ch was already the focus 
E BEING 


of serious scientific interest. 
Something being carefully ob- 
served already. 

The nuclear power plant in 
the nearest city mush-blocks 
seemed a reasonable choice. 
And good eating it made, too. 
Pure unadulterated flavor, 
strong and pulsing with vitali- 
ty. I’ve never had a better 
meal. 

But when I came out of the 
reactor and let it continue its 
food. .its energy production, 
all the hurnans had vanished. 
They hadn’t seen a thing. I 
found them miles away under 
the surface of the mush-level 
expecting to be blov/n up. 
They assumed that when the 
pile ceased its output it was 
building up internally, so they 
broadcast an emergency and 
took to their bunkers. And 
then they were busy for weeks 
correcting the false alarm and 
dealing with complaints from 
freezer companies and house- 
holders and utility commis- 
sions. So I left the area to sort 
itself out. 

Very well, I thought. This 
time, I’ll choose a nuclear de- 
vice that is expected to ex- 
plode and eat it before it does, 
while everyone is watching. 

It wasn’t difficult to find. 
There was a long smear of 
food in the air all round the 
world, as if a lot of clumsy e 
eaters had dribbled. The main 
source was easy to locate. 

T found a long stalk thing of 
-■•mush and a mush shed on 
top and sat there waiting. 

97 



Eventually, a team of mushes 
hoisted up a device with deli- 
cate little tidbit cores, and 
hurried away. So this was a 
fusion bomb, was it? I waited 
until it was triggered off, 
took a strong hold and ate the 
lot at the moment of burst. 

For the record, swallowing 
a nuclear explosion is not very 
comfortable. I had indigestion 
for weeks. But I made it. 

It was a waste of time. 

As usual, I had overlooked 
something. The conversion 
was as massive as the energy 
I ate, and I found out what 
the silver beads Doctor Mc- 
Pherson had put in the jar 
were. Energy eaten by e be- 
ings converts into sound and 
ozone. And the conversion of 
the nuclear explosion sent 
great balls of sound rolling 
over the country, deafening 
the people, flattening struc- 
tures by vibration, and releas- 
ing flows of raw ozone, which 
p omptly started fires; and 
that in turn disturbed the 
cloud masses and produced 
unnrecedented floods. 

I was munching quietly on 
r power line, overlooking the 
great stretch of level mush of 
Water up to and over the hori- 
zon, when Doctor McPherson 
found me. 

A repair man drove him up, 
let him off the mush vehicle 
and drove off fast. 

“You nutty old coot, you 
wanted to see the next break- 
down and here it is,” the re- 
pair man's thoughts shot away. 

*T may be nuts,” Doctor Mc- 
98 


Pherson said to himself, stand- 
ing underneath me, “but I have 
an odd idea there's intelligent 
mischief behind all this.” 

He sat on a rock-shaped 
mound of mush nearby. 

“So here I am, following a 
idiotic hunch,” he thought, 
and held out a large jar with 
a most entrancing tidbit of 
radioactivity, cobalt flavor, in 
the bottom. 

Naturally, I went down hap- 
pily and gobbled it up. 

And Doctor McPherson put 
the lid on. A lid of thick- 
meshed mush, leaden and in- 
edible. It took me some time 
of fruitless revolving to dis- 
cover I was locked in a Ley- 
den jar with a complicated se- 
ries of non-conducting layers. 

I’m starving. 

O H, he feeds me now and 
then, and the other day he 
put in a one-way circuit so 
that I could operate this elec- 
tric typescripter. 

But he says I can't come out 
until war is declared and the 
Pentagon signals him on 
emergency. Then he'll take 
the lid off and I can eat the 
nearest rocket heading this 
way. He’s promised me that. 

He needn’t worry. I’m so 
hungry I'll eat the lot. But 
who wants to be a secret air 
defense weapon locked in a 
Leyden jar? 

Fellow e, keep away from 
this mush and these mush- 
men ! They are dangerous. 

What's more, they have no 
finer feelings! END

iiT wrote them for you. 

-“•They’re just as Consul 
Whaffle would have wanted 
them.” 

“Did you write all Whaf- 
fle’s letters for him, Miss 
Meuhl?” 

“Consul Whaffle was an 
extremely busy man,” Miss 
Meuhl said stiffly. “He had 
complete confidence in me.” 

“Since I’m cutting out the 
culture from now on,” Retief 
said, “I won’t be so busy.” 

“Well!” Miss Meuhl said. 
“May I ask where you’ll be if 
something comes up?” 

“I’m going over to the For- 
eign Office Archives.” 

Miss Meuhl blinked behind 
thick lenses. “Whatever for?” 

Retief looked thoughtfully 
at Miss Meuhl. “You’ve been 
here on Groac for four years. 
Miss Meuhl. What was behind 
the coup d’etat that put the 
present government in pow- 
er?” 

“I’m sure I haven’t pried 
into—” 

“What about that Terrestri- 
al cruiser? The one that dis- 
appeared out this way about 
ten years back?” 

“Mr. Retief, those are just 
the sort of questions we avoid 
with the Groaci. I certainly 
hope you’re not thinking of 
openly intruding — ” 

“Why?” 

“The Groaci are a very sen- 
sitive race. They don’t wel- 
come outworlders raking up 
things. They’ve been gracious 
enough to let us live down the 
fact that Terrestrials subject- 
100 


ed them to deep humiliation 
on one occasion.” 

“You mean when they came 
looking for the cruiser?” 

“I, for one, am ashamed of 
the high-handed tactics that 
were employed, grilling these 
innocent people as though 
they were criminals. We try 
never to reopen that wound, 
Mr. Retief.” 

“They never found the 
cruiser, did they?” 

“Certainly not on Groac.” 
Retief nodded. “Thanks, 
Miss Meuhl,” he said. “I’ll be 
back before you close the of- 
fice.” Miss Meuhl's face was 
set in lines of grim disapprov- 
al as he closed the door. 

T HE pale-featured Groacian 
vibrated his throat-bladder 
in a distressed bleat. 

“Not to enter the Archives ,’ n 
he said in his faint voice. 
“The denial of permission. 
The deep regret of the Archi- 
vist.” 

“The importance of my task 
here,” Retief said, enunciating 
the glottal dialect with diffi- 
culty. “My interest in local 
history.” 

“The impossibility of access 
to outworlders. To depart 
quietly.” 

“The necessity that I en- 
ter.” 

“The specific instructions 
of the Archivist.” The Groa- 
cian’s voice rose to a whisper. 
“To insist no longer. To give 
up this idea!” 

“OK, Skinny, I know when 
I 9 m licked,” Retief said in

s 



Terran. “To keep your nose 
clean.” 

Outside, Retief stood for a 
mome'nt looking across at the 
deeply carved windowless 
stucco facades lining the 
street, then started off in the 
direction of the Terrestrial 
Consulate General. The few 
Groacians on the street eyed 
him furtively, veered to avoid 
him as he passed. Flimsy 
high-wheeled ground cars 
puffed silently along the resi- 
lient pavement. The air was 
clean and cool. 

At the office, Miss Meuhl 
would be waiting with another 
list of complaints. 

Retief studied the carving 
over the open doorways along 
the street. An elaborate one 
picked out in pinkish paint 
seemed to indicate the Gro- 
acian equivalent of a bar. Re- 
tief went in. 

A Groacian bartender was 
dispensing clay pots of alco- 
holic drink from the bar-pit at 
the center of the room. He 
looked at Retief and froze in 
mid-m o t i o n, a metal tube 
poised over a waiting pot. 

“To enjoy a cooling drink,” 
Retief said in Groacian, squat- 
ting down at the edge of the 
pit. “To sample a true Gro- 
acian beverage.” 

“To not enjoy my poor of- 
ferings,” the Groacian mum- 
bled. “A pain in the digestive 
sacs; to express regret.” 

“To not worry,” Retief said, 
irritated. “To pour it out and 
let me decide whether I like 
it.” 

THE MADMAN FROM EARTH 


“To be g r a p p 1 e d in by 
peace-keepers for poisoning of 
— foreigners.” The barkeep 
looked around for support, 
found none. The Groaci cus- 
tomers, eyes elsewhere, were 
drifting away. 

“To get the lead out,” Re- 
tief said, placing a thick gold- 
piece in the dish provided. 
“To shake a tentacle.” 

“The procuring of a cage,” 
a thin voice called from the 
sidelines. “The displaying of 
a freak.” 

R ETIEF turned. A tall Gro- 
acian vibrated his mandi- 
bles in a gesture of contempt. 
From his bluish throat color- 
ation, it was apparent the 
creature was drunk. 

“To choke in your upper 
sac,” the bartender hissed, ex- 
tending his eyes toward the 
drunk. “To keep silent, litter- 
mate of drones.” 

“To swallow your own poi- 
son, dispenser of vileness,” 
the drunk whispered. “To find 
a proper cage for this zoo- 
piece.” He wavered toward 
Retief. “To show this one in 
the streets, like all freaks.” 
“Seen a lot of freaks like 
me, have you?” Retief asked, 
interestedly. 

“To speak intelligibly, mal- 
odorous outworlder,” the 
drunk said. The barkeep whis- 
pered something, and two cus- 
tomers came up to the drunk, 
took his arms and helped him 
to the door. 

“To get a cage!” the drunk 
shrilled. “To keep the animals 

101 



in their own stinking place.” 

“I’ve changed my mind,* 
Retief said to the bartender. 
“To be grateful as hell, but to 
have to hurry off now.” He 
followed the drunk out the 
door. The other G r o a c i re- 
leased him, hurried back in- 
side. Retief looked at the 
weaving alien. 

“To begone, freak,” the Gro- 
acian whispered. 

“To be pals,” Retief said. 
“To be kind to dumb animals.” 

“To have you hauled away 
to a stockyard, ill-odored for- 
eign livestock.” 

“To not be angry, fragrant 
native,” Retief said. “To per- 
mit me to chum with you.” 

“To flee before I take a 
cane to you!” 

“To have a drink togeth- 
er — ” 

“To not endure such inso- 
lence!” The Groacian ad- 
vanced toward Retief. Retief 
backed away. 

“To hold hands,” Retief 
said. “To be palsy-walsy — ” 

The Groacian reached for 
him, missed. A passer-by 
stepped around him, head 
down, scuttled away. Retief 
backed into the opening to a 
narrow crossway and offered 
further verbal familiarities to 
the drunken local, who fol- 
lowed, furious. Retief backed, 
rounded a corner into a nar- 
row alley-like passage, desert- 
ed, silent. .except for the fol- 
lowing Groacian. 

Retief stepped around him, 
seized his collar and yanked. 
The Groacian fell oft his back. 
102 


Retief stood over him. The 
downed native half-rose; Re- 
tief put a foot against his 
chest and pushed. 

“To not be going anywhere 
for a few minutes,” Retief 
said. “To stay right here and 
have a nice long talk.” 

II 

HERE you are!” Miss 
A Meuhl said, eyeing Re- 
tief over her lenses. “There 
are two gentlemen waiting to 
see you. Groacian gentlemen.” 

“Government men, I imag- 
ine. Word travels fast.” Re- 
tief pulled off his cape. “This 
saves me the trouble of paying 
another call at the Foreign 
Ministry.” 

“What have you been do- 
ing? They seem very upset, I 
don’t mind telling you.” 

“I’m sure you don’t. Come 
along. And bring an official 
recorder.” 

Two Groaci wearing heavy 
eye-shields and elaborate crest 
ornaments indicative of rank 
rose as Retief entered the 
room. Neither offered a cour- 
teous snap of the mandibles, 
Retief noted. They were mad, 
all right. 

“I am Fith, of #te Terrestri- 
al Desk, Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, Mr. Consul,” the tall- 
er Groacian said, in lisping 
Terran. “May I present Shluh> 
of the Internal Police?” 

“Sit down, gentlemen,” Re- 
tief said. They resumed their 
seats. Miss Meuhl hovered 
nervously, then sat on the 

by Keith Laumer 



edge of a comfortless chair. 

“Oh, it's such a pleasure—” 
she began. 

“Never mind that,” Retief 
said. “These gentlemen didn’t 
come here to sip tea today.” 

“So true,” Fith said. 
“Frankly, I have had a most 
disturbing report, Mr. Con- 
sul. I shall ask Shluh to re- 
count it.” He nodded to the 
police chief. 

“One hour ago,” The Gro- 
acian said, “a Groacian nation- 
al was brought to hospital suf- 
fering from serious contu- 
sions. Questioning of this in- 
dividual revealed that he had 
been set upon and beaten by a 
foreigner. A Terrestrial, to be 
precise. Investigation by my 
department indicates that the 
description of the culprit 
closely matches that of the 
Terrestrial Consul.” 

Miss Meuhl gasped audibly. 

“Have you ever heard,” Re- 
tief said, looking steadily at 
Fith, “of a Terrestrial cruiser, 
the ISV T e t t i f i c, which 
dropped from sight in this 
sector nine years ago?” 

“Really !” Miss Meuhl ex- 
claimed, rising. “I wash my 
hands — ” 

“Just keep that recorder go- 
ing,” Retief snapped. 

“I’ll not be a party — ” 

“You’ll do as you’re told, 
Miss Meuhl,” Retief said 
quietly. “I’m telling you to 
make an official sealed rec- 
ord of this conversation.” 

Miss Meuhl sat down. 

Fith puffed out his throat 
indignantly. “You reopen an 
THE MADMAN FROM EARTH 


old wound, Mr. Consul. It re- 
minds us of certain illegal 
treatment at Terrestrial 
hands — ” 

“Hogwash,” Retief said. 
“That tune went over with my 
predecessors, but it hits a sour 
note with me.” 

“All our effort s,” Miss 
Meuhl said, “to live down that 
terrible episode! And you — ” 

“Terrible? I understand 
that a Terrestrial task force 
stood off Groac and sent a 
delegation down to ask ques- 
tions. They got some funny 
answers, and stayed on to dig 
around a little. After a week 
they left. Somewhat annoying 
to the Groac i, maybe — at the 
most. If they were innocent.” 

“IF !” Miss Meuhl burst out. 

“If, indeed!” Fith said, his 
weak voice trembling. “I must 
protest your — ” 

4£OAVE the protests, Fith. 

^ You have some explain- 
ing to do. And I don’t think 
your story will be good 
enough.” 

“It is for you to explain! 

This person who was beat^ 

_ „ >» 

en — 

“Not beaten. Just rapped a 
few times to loosen his mem- 
ory.” 

“Then you admit—” 

“It worked, too. He remem- 
bered lots of things, once he 
put his mind to it.” 

Fith rose ; -Shluh followed 
suit. 

“I shall ask for your imme- 
diate recall, Mr. Consul. Were 
it not for your diplomatic im- 

103 



munity, I should do more — ” 

“Why did the government 
fall, Fith? It was just after 
the task force paid its visit, 
and before the arrival of the 
first Terrestrial diplomatic 
mission.” 

“This is an internal mat- 
ter!” Fith cried, in his faint 
Groacian voice. “The new re- 
gime has shown itself most 
amiable to you Terrestrials. It 
has outdone itself — ” 

“ — to keep the Terrestrial 
consul and his staff in the 
dark,” Retief said. “And the 
same goes for the few terres- 
trail businessmen you've vi- 
saed. This continual round of 
culture ; no social contacts 
outside the diplomatic circle; 
no travel permits to visit out- 
lying districts, or your satel- 
lite—” 

“Enough!” Fith’s mandibles 
quivered in distress. “I can 
talk no more of this matter — ” 

“Y o u ’ 1 1 talk to me, or 
there’ll be a task force here in 
five days to do the talking,” 
Retief said. 

“You can’t!” Miss Meuhl 
gasped. 

Retief turned a steady look 
on Miss Meuhl. She closed her 
mouth. The Groaci sat down. 

“Answer me this one,” Re- 
tief said, looking at Shluh. “A 
few years back — about nine, I 
think — there was a little pa- 
rade held here. Some curious 
looking creatures were cap- 
tured. After being securely 
caged, they were exhibited to 
the gentle Groaci public. 
Hauled through the streets, 
104 


Very educational, no doubt. A 
highly cultural show. 

“Funny thing about these 
animals. They wore clothes. 
They seemed to communicate 
with each other. Altogether it 
was a very amusing exhibit. 

“Tell me, Shluh, what hap- 
pened to those six Terrestrials 
after the parade was over?” 

F ITH made a choked noise 
and spoke rapidly to Shluh 
in Groacian. Shluh retracted 
his eyes, shrank down in his 
chair. Miss Meuhl opened her 
mouth, closed it and blinked 
rapidly. 

“How did they die?” Retief 
snapped. “Did you murder 
them, cut their throats, shoot 
them or bury them alive? 
What amusing end did you 
figure out for them? Research, 
maybe? Cut them open to see 
what made they yell. .” 
“No!” Fith gasped. “I must 
correct this terrible false im- 
pression at once.” 

“False impression, hell,” Re- 
tief said. “They were Terrans! 
A simple narco-interrogation 
would get that out of any Gro- 
acian who saw the parade.” 

“Yes,” Fith said weakly. “It 
is true, they were Terrestrials. 
But there was no killing.” 
“They’re alive?” 

“Alas, no. They. .died.” 
Miss Meuhl yelped faintly. 
“I see,” Retief said. “They 
died.” 

“We tried to keep them 
alive, of course. But we did 
not know what foods — ” 
“Didn’t take the trouble to 

fry Keith Laumer 



find out, either, did you?” 
“They fell ill,” Fith said. 
“One by one. .” 

“We'll deal with that ques- 
tion later,” Retief said. “Right 
now, I want more information. 
Where did you get them? 
Where did you hide the ship? 
What happened to the rest of 
the crew? Did they ‘fall ill’ 
before the big parade?” 

“There were no more! Ab- 
solutely, I assure you !” 

“Killed in the crash land- 
ing?” 

“No crash landing. The ship 
descended intact, east of the 
city. The . Terrestrials. 
were unharmed. Naturally, we 
feared them. They were 
strange to us. We had never 
before seen such beings.” 
“Stepped off the ship with 
guns blazing, did they?” 
“Guns? No, no guns — ” 
“They raised their hands, 
didn't they? Asked for help. 
You helped them; helped them 
to death.” 

“How could we know?” Fith 
moaned. 

“How could you know a flo- 
tilla would show up in a few 
months looking for them, you 
mean? That was a shock, 
wasn't it? I'll bet you had a 
brisk time of it hiding the 
ship, and shutting everybody 
up. A close call, eh?” 

“We were afraid,” Shluh 
said. “We are a simple people. 
We feared the strange crea- 
tures from the alien craft. We 
did not kill them, but we felt 
it was as well they. .did not 
survive. Then, when the war- 
THE MADMAN FROM EARTH 


ships came, we realized our er- 
ror. But we feared to speak. 
We purged our guilty leaders, 
concealed what had happened, 
and. .offered our friendship. 
We invited the opening of 
diplomatic relations. We made 
a blunder, it is true, a great 
blunder. But we have tried to 
make amends. .” 

“Where is the ship?” 

“The ship?” 

“What did you do with it? 
It was too big to just walk off 
and forget. Where is it?” 

The two Groacians ex- 
changed looks. 

“We wish to show our con- 
trition,” Fith said. “We will 
show you the ship.” 

“Miss Meuhl,” Retief said. 
“If I don't come back in a rea- 
sonable length of time, trans- 
mit that recording to Regional 
Headquarters, seale dA He 
stood, looked at the Groaci. 
“Let's go,” he said. 

R ETIEF stooped under the 
heavy timbers shoring the 
entry to the cavern. He peered 
into the gloom at the curving 
flank of the space-burned 
hull. 

“Any lights in here?” he 
asked. 

A Groacian threw a switch. 
A weak bluish glow sprang 
up. 

Retief walked along the 
raised wooden catwalk, study- 
ing the ship. Empty emplace- 
ments gaped below lensless 
scanner eyes. Littered decking 
was visible within the half- 
open entry port. Near the bow 

105 



the words TVS Terrific B7 
New Terra’ were lettered in 
bright chrome duralloy. 

“How did you get it in 
here?” Retief asked. 

“ It was hauled here from 
the landing point, some nine 
miles distant,” Fith said, his 
voice thinner than ever. “This 
is a natural crevasse. The ves- 
sel was lowered into it and 
roofed over.” 

“How did you shield it so 
the detectors didn’t pick it 
up?” 

“All here is high-grade iron 
ore,” Fith said, waving a mem- 
ber. “Great veins of almost 
pure metal.” 

Retief grunted. “Let’s go in- 
side.” 

Shluh came forward with a 
hand-lamp. The party entered 
the ship. 

Retief clambered up a nar- 
row companionway, glanced 
around the interior of the con- 
trol compartment. Dust was 
thick on the deck, the stan- 
c h i o n s where acceleration 
couches had been mounted, 
the empty instrument panels, 
the 1 itter of sheared bolts, 
scraps of wire and paper. A 
thin frosting of rust dulled 
the exposed metal where cut- 
ting torches had sliced away 
heavy shielding. There was a 
faint odor of stale bedding. 

“The cargo compartment — ” 
Shluh began* 

“I!ve seen enough,” Retief 
said. 

Silently* the Groacians led 
the way back out through the 
tunnel and into the late after- 

toe 


noon sunshine. As they 
climbed the slope to the steam 
car, Fith came to Retief ’s side. 

“Indeed, I hope that this 
will be the end of this unfor- 
tunate affair,” he said. “Now 
that all has been fully and 
honestly shown — ” 

“You can skip all that,” Re- 
tief said. “You’re nine years 
late. The crew was still alive 
when the task force called, I 
imagine. You killed them — or 
let them die — rather than take 
the chance of admitting what 
you’d done.” 

“We were at fault,” Fith 
said abjectly. “Now we wish 
only friendship.” 

“The Terrific was a heavy 
cruiser, about twenty thou- 
sand tons.” Retief looked 
grimly at the slender Foreign 
Office official. “Where is she, 
Fith? I won’t settle for a hun- 
dred-ton lifeboat.” 

F ITH erected his eye stalks 
so violently that one eye- 
shield fell off. 

“I know nothing of... 
of . .” He stopped. His throat 
vibrated rapidly as he strug- 
gled for calm. 

“My government can enter- 
tain no further accusations, 
Mr. Consul,” he said at last. “I 
have been completely candid 
with you, I have overlooked 
your probing into matters not 
properly within your sphere 
of responsibility. My patience 
is at an end.” 

“Where is that ship?” Re- 
tief rapped out. You never 
learn, do you? You’re still 

by Keith Laumer 



convinced you can hide the 
whole thing and forget it. I'm 
telling you you can't." 

“We return to the city 
now," Fith said. “I can do no 
more." 

“You can and you will, 
Fith/' Retief said. “I intend 
to get to the truth of this mat- 
ter." 

Fith spoke to Shluh in rap- 
id Groacian. The police chief 
gestured to his four armed 
constables. They moved to 
ring Retief in. 

Retief eyed Fith. “Don’t try 
it," he said. “You'll just get 
yourself in deeper." 

Fith clacked his mandibles 
angrily, eye stalks canted ag- 
gressively toward the Terres- 
trial. 

“Out of deference to your 
diplomatic status, Terrestrial, 
I shall ignore your insulting 
remarks," Fith said in his 
reedy voice. “Let us now re- 
turn to the city." 

Retief looked at the four 
policemen. “I see your point,” 
he said. 

Fith followed him into the 
car, sat rigidly at the far end 
of the seat. 

“I advise you to remain 
very close to your consulate," 
Fith said. “I advise you to 
dismiss these fancies from 
your mind, and to enjoy the 
cultural aspects of life at Gro- 
ac. Especially, I should not 
venture out of the city, or ap- 
pear overly curious about mat> 
ters of concern only to the 
Groacian government." 

In the front seat, Shluh 
THE, MADMAFJ FROM EARTH 


looked straight ahead. The 
loosely-sprung vehicle bobbed 
and swayed along the narrow 
highway. Retief listened to 
the rhythmic puffing of the 
motor and said nothing. 

Ill 

a M !SS Meuhl," Retief 
said, “I want you to lis- 
ten carefully to what I'm go- 
ing to tell you. I have to move 
rapidly now, to catch the Gro- 
aci off guard." 

“I’m sure I don't know what 
you're talking about," Miss 
Meuhl snapped, her eyes sharp 
behind the heavy lenses. 

“If you'll listen, you may 
find out," Retief said. “I 
have no time to waste, Miss 
Meuhl. They won't be expect- 
ing an immediate move — I 
hope — and that may give me 
the latitude I need." 

“You're still determined to 
make an issue of that inci- 
dent!" Miss Meuhl snorted. “I 
really can hardly blame the 
Groaci. They are not a sophis- 
ticated race; they had never 
before met aliens." 

“You're ready to forgive a 
great deal, Miss Meuhl. But 
it's not what happened nine 
years ago I'm concerned with. 
It’s what's happening now. 
I've told you that it was only 
a lifeboat the Groaci have 
hidden out. Don't you under- 
stand the implication? That 
vessel couldn't have come far. 
The cruiser itself? must be 
somewhere near by. 1 want to 
know where !" 


107 



“The Groaci don’t know. 
They’re a very cultured, gen- 
tle people. You can do irre- 
parable harm to the reputation 
of Terrestrials if you in- 
sist—” 

“That’s my decision,” Re- 
tief said. “I have a job to do 
and we’re wasting time.” He 
crossed the room to his desk, 
opened a drawer and took out 
a slim-barreled needier. 

“This office is being 
watched. Not very efficiently, 
if I know the Groaci. I think 
I can get past them all right.” 

“Where are you going with 
...that?” Miss Meuhl stared 
at the needier. “What in the 
world—” 

“The Groaci won’t waste 
any time destroying every 
piece of paper in their files 
relating to this thing. I have 
to get what I need before it’s 
too late. If I wait for an offi- 
cial Inquiry Commission, 
they’ll find nothing but blank 
smiles.” 

“You’re out of your mind!” 
Miss Meuhl stood up, quiver- 
ing with indignation. “You’re 
like a. .a. .” 

“You and I are in a tight 
spot, Miss Meuhl. The logical 
next move for the Groaci is to 
dispose of both of us. We’re 
the only ones who know hap- 
pened. Fith almost did the 
job this afternoon, but I 
bluffed him out — for the mo- 
ment.” 

Miss Meuhl emitted a shrill 
laugh. “Your fantasies are 
getting the better of you,” she 
gasped. “In danger, indeed ! 

108 


Disposing of me! I’ve never 
heard anything so ridiculous.” 

“Stay in this office. Close 
and safe-lock the door. You’ve 
got food and water in the dis- 
penser. I suggest you stock up, 
before they shut the supply 
down. Don’t let anyone in, on 
any pretext whatever. I’ll keep 
in touch with you via hand- 
phone.” 

“What are you planning to 
do?” 

“If I don’t make it back 
here, transmit the sealed rec- 
ord of this afternoon’s conver- 
sation, along with the informa- 
tion I’ve given you. Beam it 
through on a mayday priority. 
Then tell the Groaci what 
you’ve done and sit tight. I 
think you’ll be all right. It 
won’t be easy to blast in here 
and anyway, they won’t make 
things worse by kiling you. A 
force can be here in a week.” 

“I’ll do nothing of the sort! 
The Groaci are very fond of 
me ! You ... J ohnny-come-late- 
ly! Roughneck! Setting out to 
destroy — ” 

“Blame it on me if it will 
make you feel any better,” Re- 
tief said, “but don’t be fool 
enough to trust them.” He 
pulled on a cape, opened the 
door. 

“I’ll be back in a couple of 
hours,” he said. Miss Meuhl 
stared after him silently as he 
closed the door. 

I T was an hour before dawn 
when Retief keyed the com- 
bination to the safe-lock and 
stepped into the darkened con- 

by Keith Laumer 



sular office. He looked tired. 

Miss Meuhl, dozing in a 
chair, awoke with a start. She 
looked at Retief, rose and 
snapped on a light, turned to 
stare. 

“What in the w o r 1 d — 
Where have you been? What’s 
happened to your clothing?” 

“I got a little dirty. Don’t 
worry about it.” Retief went 
to his desk, opened a drawer 
and replaced the needier. 

“Where have you been?” 
Miss Meuhl demanded. “I 
stayed here — ” 

“I’m glad you did,” Retief 
said. “I hope you piled up a 
supply of food and water from 
the dispenser, too. We’ll be 
holed up here for a week, at 
least.” He jotted figures on a 
pad. “Warm up the official 
sender. I have a long trans- 
mission for Regional Head- 
quarters.” 

“Are you going to tell me 
where you’ve been?” 

“I have a message to get off 
first, Miss Meuhl,” , Retief 
said sharply. “I’ve been to the 
Foreign Ministry,” he added. 
“I’ll tell you all about it la- 
ter.” 

“At this hour? There’s no 
one there. ” 

“Exactly.” 

Miss Meuhl gasped. “You 
mean you broke in? You bur- 
gled the Foreign Office?” 

“That’s right,” Retief said 
calmly. “Now — ” 

“This is absolutely the 
erid !” Miss Meuhl said. 
“Thank heaven I’ve already — ” 

“Get that sender going, 

THE MADMAN FROM EARTH 


woman !” Retief snapped. 
“This is important.” 

“I’ve already done so, Mr. 
Retief!” Miss Meuhl said 
harshly. “I’ve been waiting for 
you to come back here...” 
She turned to the communi- 
cator, flipped levers. The 
screen snapped aglow, and a 
wavering long-distance image 
appeared. 

“He’s here now,” Miss 
Meuhl said to the screen. She 
looked at Retief triumphant- 

!y- 

“That’s good,” Retief said. 
“I don’t think the Groaci can 
knock* us off the air, but — ” 

“I have done my duty, Mr. 
Retief,” Miss Meuhl said. “I 
made a full report to Regional 
Headquarters last night, as 
soon as you left this office. 
Any doubts I may have had as 
to the rightness of that deci- 
sion have been completely dis- 
pelled by what you’ve just 
told me.” 

Retief looked at her levelly. 
“You’ve been a busy girl. Miss 
Meuhl. Did you mention the 
six Terrestrials who were 
killed here?” 

“That had no bearing on the 
matter of your wild behavior! 
I must say, in all my years in 
the Corps, I’ve never encoun- 
tered a personality less suited 
to diplomatic work.” 

T HE screen crackled, the 
ten-second transmission lag 
having elapsed. “Mr. Retief,” 
the face on the screen said, “I 
am Counsellor Pardy, DSO-1, 
Deputy Under-secretary for 

109 



the region. I have received a 
report on your conduct which 
makes it mandatory for me to 
relieve you administratively, 
vice 'Miss Yolanda Meuhl, 
DAO-9. Pending the findings 
of a Board of Inquiry, you 
will — ” 

Retief reached out and 
snapped off the communica- 
tor. The triumphant look fad- 
ed from Miss Meuhl’s face. 

“Why, what is the mean- 

• „ » 

ing — 

“If I’d listened any longer, 
I might have heard something 
I couldn’t ignore. I can’t af- 
ford that, at this moment. 
Listen, Miss Meuhl,” Retief 
went on earnestly, “I’ve found 
the missing cruiser.” 

“You heard him relieve 
you !” 

“I heard him say he was 
going to, Miss Meuhl. But un- 
til I’ve heard and acknowl- 
edged a verbal order, it has no 
force. If I’m wrong, he’ll get 
my resignation. If I’m right, 
that suspension would be em- 
barrassing all around.” 

“You’re defying lawful au- 
thority! I’m in charge here 
now.” Miss Meuhl stepped to 
the local communicator. 

“I’m going to report this 
terrible thing to the Groaci at 
once, and offer my pro- 
found — ’* 

“Don’t touch that screen,” 
Retief said. “You go sit in 
that corner where I can keep 
an eye on you. I’m going to 
make .a sealed tape for trans- 
m i ssion to Headquarters, 
along with a call for an armed 
110 


task force. Then we’ll settle 
down to wait.” 

Retief ignored Miss Meuhl’s 
fury as he spoke into the re- 
corder. 

The local communicator 
chimed. Miss Meuhl jumped 
up, staring at it. 

“Go ahead,” Retief said. 
“Answer it.” 

A Groacian official ap- 
peared on the screen. 

“Yolanda Meuhl,” he said 
without preamble, “for the 
Foreign Minister of the Groa- 
cian Autonomy, I herewith 
accredit you as Terrestrial 
Consul to Groac, in accord- 
ance with the advices trans- 
mitted to my government di- 
rect from the Terrestrial 
Headquarters. As consul, you 
are requested to make avail- 
able for questioning Mr. J. 
Retief, former consul, in con- 
nection with the assault on 
two peace keepers and illegal 
entry into the offices of the 
Ministry for Foreign Af- 
fairs.” 

“Why, why,” Miss Meuhl 
stammered. “Yes, of course. 
And I do want to express my 
deepest regrets — ” 

R ETIEF rose, went to the 
communicator, assisted 
Miss Meuhl aside. 

“Listen carefully, Fith,” he 
said. “Your bluff has been 
called. You don’t come in and 
we don’t come out. Your cam- 
ouflage worked for nine years, 
but it’s all over now. I suggest 
you keep your heads and re- 
sist the temptation to make 

by Keith Laumer 



matters worse than they are.” 

“Miss Meuhl,” Fith said, “a 
peace squad waits outside your 
consulate. It is clear you are 
in the hands of a dangerous 
lunatic. As always, the Groaci 
wish only friendship with the 
Terrestrials, but — ” 

“Don’t bother,” Retief said. 
“You know what was in those 

files I looked over this morn- 

• _ »# 
ing. 

Retief turned at a sound be- 
hind him. Miss Meuhl was at 
the door, reaching for the 
safe-lock release. 

“Don’t!” Retief jumped — 
too late. 

The door burst inward. A 
crowd of crested Groaci 
pressed into the room, pushed 
M iss Meuhl back, aimed scat- 
ter guns at Retief. Police 
Chief Shluh pushed forward. 

“Attempt no violence. Ter- 
restrial,” he said. “I cannot 
promise to restrain my men.” 

“You’re violating Terres- 
trial territory, Shluh,” Retief 
said steadily. “I suggest you 
move back out the same way 
you came in.” 

“I invited them here,” Miss 
Meuhl spoke up. “They are 
here at my express wish.” 

“Are they? Are you sure 
you meant to go this far. Miss 
Meuhl? A squad of armed 
Groaci in the consulate?” 

“You are the consul, Miss 
Yolanda Meuhl,” Shluh said. 
“Would it not be best if we 
removed this deranged person 
to a place of safety?” 

“You’re making a serious 
mistake, Shluh,” Retief said. 
THE MADMAN FROM EARTH 


“Yes,” Miss Meuhl said. 
“You’re quite right, Mr. 
Shluh. Please escort Mr. Re- 
tief to his quarters in this 
building — ” 

“I don’t advise you to vio- 
late my diplomatic immunity, 
Fith,” Retief said. 

“As chief of mission,” Miss 
Meuhl said quickly, “I hereby 
waive immunity in the case 6f 
Mr. Retief.” 

Shluh produced a hand re- 
corder. “Kindly repeat your 
statement, Madam, officially,” 
he said. “I wish no question 
to arise later.” 

“Don’t be a fool, woman,” 
Retief said. “Don’t you see 
what you’re letting yourself in 
for? This would be a hell of a 
good time for you to figure 
out whose side you’re on.” 

“I’m on the side of common 
decency !” 

“You’ve been taken in. 
These people are conceal- 
ing—” 

“You think all women are 
fools, don’t you, Mr. Retief?” 
She turned to the police chief 
and spoke into the microphone 
he held up. 

“That’s an illegal waiver,” 
Retief said. “I’m consul here, 
whatever rumors you’ve heard. 
This thing’s coming out into 
the open, whatever you do. 
Don’t add violation of the 
Consulate to the list of Groa- 
cian astrocities.” 

“Take the man,” Shluh said. 

T WO tall Groaci came to 
Retief’s side, guns aimed 
at his chest. 

Ill 



"Determined to hang your- 
selves, aren’t you?” Retief 
said. "I hope you have sense 
enough not to lay a hand on 
this poor fool here.” He jerked 
a thumb at Miss Meuhl. "She 
doesn’t know anything. I 
hadn’t had time to tell her yet. 
She thinks you’re a band of 
angels.” 

The cop at Retief’s side 
swung the butt of his scatter- 
gun, connected solidly with 
Retief’s jaw. Retief staggered 
against a Groacian, was caught 
and thrust upright, blood run- 
ning down onto his shirt. Miss 
Meuhl yelped. Shluh barked at 
the guard in shrill Groacian, 
then turned to stare at Miss 
Meuhl. 

"What has this man told 

you ?” 

"I — nothing. I refused to 
listen to his ravings.” 

"He said nothing to you 
of some. .alleged. .involve- 
ment?” 

"I’ve told you!” Miss Meuhl 
said sharply. She looked at the 
blood on Retief’s shirt. 

"He told me nothing,” she 
whispered. "I swear it.” 

"Let it lie, boys,” Retief 
said, "Before you spoil that * 
good impression.” 

Shluh looked at Miss Meuhl 
for a long moment. Then he 
turned. 

"Let us go,” he said. He 
turned back to Miss Meuhl. 
"Do not leave this building 
until further advice,” he said. 

"But. .1 am the Terrestrial 
consul !” 

"For your safety, madam. 

112 


The people are aroused at the 
beating of Groacian nationals 
by an. .alien.” 

"So long, Meuhlsie,” Retief 
said. "You played it real 
foxy.” 

"You’ll. .lock him in his 
quarters?” Miss Meuhl said. 

"What is done with him is 
now a Groacian affair, Miss 
Meuhl. You yourself have 
withdrawn the protection of 
your government.” 

"I didn’t mean — ” 

"Don’t start having second 
thoughts,” Retief said. "They 
can make you miserable.” 

"I had no choice,” Miss 
Meuhl said. "I had to consider 
the best interest of the Ser- 
vice. 

"My mistake, I guess,” Re- 
tief said. "I was thinking of 
the best interests of a Terres- 
trial cruiser with three hun- 
dred men aboard.” 

"Enough,” Shluh said. "Re- 
move this criminal.” He ges- 
tured to the peace keepers. 

"Move along,” he said to 
Retief. He turned to Miss 
Meuhl. 

"A pleasure to deal with 
you, Madam.” 

IV 

R ETIEF stood quietly in the 
lift, stepped out at the 
ground floor and followed 
docilely down the corridor 
and across the pavement to a 
waiting steam car. 

One of the peace keepers 
rounded the vehicle to enter 
on the other side. Two 

by Keith Laumer 



stooped to climb into the 
front seat. Shluh gestured Re- 
tief into the back seat and got 
in behind him. The others 
moved off on foot. 

The car started up and 
pulled away. The cop in the 
front seat turned to look at 
Retief. 

“To have some sport with 
it, and then to kill it,” he said. 

“To have a fair trial first,” 
Shluh said. The car rocked 
and jounced, rounded a cor- 
ner, puffed along between or- 
namented pastel facades. 

“To have a trial and then to 
have a bit of sport,” the cop 
said. 

“To suck the eggs in your 
own hill,” Retief said. “To 
make another stupid mistake.” 

Shluh raised his short cere- 
monial club and cracked Re- 
tief across the temple. Retief 
shook his head, tensed — 

The cop in the front seat 
beside the driver turned and 
rammed the barrel of his scat- 
ter-gun against Retief’s ribs. 

“To make no move, out- 
worlder,” he said. Shluh 
raised his club and carefully 
struck Retief again. He 
slumped. 

The car swayed, rounded an- 
other corner. Retief slid over 
against the police chief. 

“To fend this animal — ” 
Shluh began. His weak voice 
was cut off short as Retief’s 
hand shot out, took him by 
the throat and snapped him 
down onto the floor. As the 
guard on Retief’s left lunged, 
Retief uppercut him, slam- 
THE MADMAN FROM EARTH 


ming his head against the 
door post. He grabbed the 
scatter-gun as it fell, pushed 
into ... the mandibles of the 
Groacian in the front seat. 

“To put your popgun over 
the seat — carefully — and drop 
it,” he said. 

Tho driver slammed on his 
brakes, whirled to raise his 
gun. Retief cracked the gun 
barrel against the head of the 
Groacian before him, then 
swiveled to aim it at the 
driver. 

“To keep your eyestalks on 
the road,” he said. The driver 
grabbed at the tiller and 
shrank against the window, 
watching Retief with one eye, 
driving with the other. 

“To gun this thing,” Retief 
said. “To keep moving.” 

Shluh stirred on the floor. 
Retief put a foot on him, 
pressed him back. The cop be- 
side Retief moved. Retief 
pushed him off the seat onto 
the floor. 

He held the scatter-gun 
with one hand and mopped at 
the blood on his face with the 
other. The car bounded over 
the irregular surface of the 
road, puffing furiously. 

“Your death will not be an 
easy one, Terrestrial,” Shluh 
said in Terran. 

“No easier than I can help,” 
Retief said. “Shut up for now, 
I want to think.” 

T HE car passed the last of 
the relief-crusted mounds, 
sped along between tilled 
fields.

“Slow down,” Retief said. 
The driver obeyed. 

“Turn down this side road.” 

The car bumped off onto an 
unpaved surface, threaded its 
way back among tall stalks. 

“Stop her e.” The car 
stopped. It blew off steam and 
sat trembling as the hot en- 
gine idled roughly. 

Retief opened the door, 
took his foot off Shluh. 

“Sit up,” he ordered. “You 
two in front listen carefully.” 
Shluh sat up, rubbing his 
throat. 

“Three of you are getting 
out here,” Retief said. “Good 
old Shluh is going to stick 
around to drive for me. If I 
get that nervous feeling that 
the cops are after me, I’ll toss 
him out to confuse them. That 
will be pretty messy, at high 
speed. Shluh, tell them to sit 
tight until dark and forget 
about sounding any alarms. 
I’d hate to see your carapace 
split and spill loveable you all 
over the pavement.” 

“To burst your throat sac, 
evil-smelling beast!” Shluh 
hissed. 

“Sorry, I haven’t got one.” 
Retief put the gun under 
Shluh’s ear. “Tell them, Shluh. 
I can drive myself, in a 
pinch.” 

“To do as the foreign one 
says; to stay hidden until 
dark,” Shluh said. 

“Everybody out,” Retief 
said. “And take this with 
you.” He nudged the uncon- 
scious Groacian. “Shluh* you 
get in the driver’s seat. You 
THE MADMAN FROM EARTH 


others stay where I can see 
you.” 

Retief watched as the Gro- 
aci silently followed instruc- 
tions. 

“All right, Shluh,” Retief 
said softly. “Let’s go. Take 
me to Groac Spaceport by the 
shortest route that doesn’t go 
through the city. And be very 
careful about making any sud- 
den movements.” 

F ORTY minutes later, Shluh 
steered the car up to the 
sentry-guarded gate in the se- 
curity fence surrounding the 
military enclosure at Groac 
Spaceport. 

“Don’t yield to any rash im- 
pulses,” Retief whispered as a 
crested Groacian soldier came 
up. Shluh grated his mandi- 
bles in helpless fury. 

“Drone-master Shluh, Inter- 
nal Security,” he croaked. The 
guard tilted his eyes toward 
Retief. 

“The guest of the Auton- 
omy,” Shluh added. “To let 
me pass or to rot in this spot, 
fool?” 

“To pass, D r o n e-master,” 
the sentry mumbled. He was 
still staring at Retief as the 
car moved jerkily away. 

“You are as good as pegged 
out on the hill in the pleasure 
pits now, Terrestrial,” Shluh 
said in Terran. “Why do you 
venture here?” 

“Pull over there in the sha- 
dow of the tower and stop,” 
Retief said. 

Shluh c o m Retief 

studied the row of four slen- 


115 



der ships parked on the ramp, 
navigation lights picked out 
against the early dawn colors 
of the sky. 

“Which of those boats are 
ready to lift?” Retief demand- 
ed. 

Shluh swiveled a choleric 
eye. 

“All of them are shuttles; 
they have no range. They will 
not help you.” 

“To answer the question, 
Shluh, or to get another crack 
on the head.” 

“You are not like other Ter- 
restrials! You are a mad dog!” 

“We’ll rough out a charac- 
ter sketch of me later. Are 
they all fueled up? You know 
the procedures here. Did those 
shuttles just get in, or is that 
the ready line?” 

“Yes. All are fueled and 
ready for take-off.” 

“I hope you’re right, Shluh. 
You and I are going to drive 
over and get in one; if it 
doesn’t lift, I’ll kill you and 
try the next. Let’s go.” 

“You are mad ! I have told 
you — these boats have not 
more than ten thousand ton- 
seconds capacity. They are 
useful only for satellite runs.” 

“Never mind the details. 
Let’s try the first in line.” 

Shluh let in the clutch and 
the steam car clanked and 
heaved, rolled off toward the 
line of boats. 

“Not the first in line,” 
Shluh said suddenly. “The 
last is the more likely to be 
fueled. But — ” 

“Smart grasshopper,” Retief 
116 


said. “Pull up to the entry 
port, hop out and go right up. 
I’ll be right behind you.” 
“The gangway guard. The 
challenging of — ” 

“More details. Just give him 
a dirty look and say what’s 
necessary. You know the tech- 
nique.” 

T HE car passed under the 
stern of the first boat, 
then the second. There was no 
alarm. It rounded the third 
and shuddered to a stop by the 
open port of the last vessel. 

“Out,” Retief said. “To 
make it snappy.” 

Shluh stepped from the car, 
hesitated as the guard came to 
attention, then hissed at him 
and mounted the steps. The 
guard looked wonderingly at 
Retief, mandibles slack. 

“An outworlder!” he said. 
He unlimbered his scatter- 
gun. “To stop here, meat-faced 
one.” 

Shluh froze, turned. 

“To snap to attention, litter- 
mate of drones!” Retief 
rasped in Groacian. The guard 
jumped, waved his eye stalks 
and came to attention. 

“About face!” Retief hissed. 
“Hell out of here — to march !” 
The guard tramped off 
across the ramp. Retief took 
the steps two at a time, 
slammed the port shut behind 
himself. 

“I’m glad your boys have a 
little discipline, Shluh,” Re- 
tief said. “What did you say 
to him?” 

“I but—” 


by Keith Laumer 



'"Never mind. We’re in. Get 
up to the control compart- 
ment.” 

“What do you know of Gro- 
acian naval vessels?” 

“Plenty. This is a straight 
copy from the lifeboat you 
lads hijacked. I can run it. 
Get going.” 

Retief followed Shluh up 
the companionway into the 
cramped control room. 

“Tie in, Shluh,” Retief or- 
dered. 

“This is insane !” Shluh 
said. “We have only fuel 
enough for a one-way transit 
to the satellite. We cannot 
enter orbit, nor can we land 
again! To lift this boat is 
death — unless your destina- 
tion is our moon.” 

“The moon is down, Shluh,” 
Retief said. “And so are we. 
But not for long. Tie in.” 

“Release me,” Shluh gasped. 
“I promise you immunity.” 

“If I have to tie you in my- 
self, I might bend your head 
in the process.” 

Shluh crawled onto the 
couch, strapped in. 

“Give it up,” he said. “I will 
see that you are reinstated — 
with honor ! I will guarantee a 
safe conduct.” 

“Countdown,” Retief said. 
He threw in the autopilot. 

“It is death!” Shluh 
screeched. 

The gyros hummed; timers 
ticked ; relays closed. Retief 
lay relaxed on the accelera- 
tion pad. Shluh breathed nois- 
ily, his mandibles clicking 
rapidly. 

THE MADMAN FROM EARTH 


“That I had fled in time,” 
Shluh said in a hoarse whis- 
per. “This is not a good 
death. .” 

“No death is a good death,” 
Retief said. “Not for a while 
yet.” The red light flashed on 
in the center of the panel, and 
abruptly sound filled the uni- 
verse. The ship trembled, lift- 
ed. 

Retief could hear Shluh’s 
whimpering even through the 
roar of the drive. 

«|}ERIHELION,” Shluh 

* said dully. “To begin 
now the long fall back.” 

“Not quite,” Retief said. “I 
figure eighty-five seconds to 
go.” He scanned the instru- 
ments, frowning. 

“We will not reach the sur- 
face, of course,” Shluh said in 
Terran. “The pips on the 
screen are missiles. We have a 
rendezvous in space, Retief. 
In your madness, may you be 
content.” 

“They’re fifteen minutes be- 
hind us, Shluh. Your defenses 
are sluggish.” 

“Nevermore to burrow in 
the gray sands of Groac,” 
Shluh said. 

Retief’s eyes were fixed on 
a dial face. 

“Any time now,” he said 
softly. Shluh conted his eye 
stalks. 

“What do you seek?” 

Retief stiffened. 

“Look at the screen,” he 
said. Shluh looked. A glowing 
point, off-center, moving rap- 
idly across the grid... 


117 



"What—” 

"Later !” 

Shluh watched as Retief’s 
eyes darted from one needle 
to another. 

"How...” 

"For your own neck’s sake, 
Shluh,” Retief said, "you’d 
better hope this works.” He 
flipped the sending key. 

"2396 TR-42 G, this is the 
Terrestrial Consul at Groac, 
aboard Groac 902, vectoring o'n 
you at an MP fix of 91/54/94. 
Can you read me? Over.” 

"What forlorn gesture is 
this?” Shluh whispered. "You 
cry in the night to empti- 
ness !” 

"Button your mandibles,” 
Retief snapped, listening. 
There was a faint hum of stel- 
lar background noise. Retief 
repeated his call, waited. 

"Maybe they hear but can’t 
answer,” he muttered. He 
flipped the key. 

"2396, you’ve got twenty 
seconds to lock a tractor beam 
on me, or I’ll be past you like 
a shot of rum past a sailor’s 
bridgework. .” 

"To call into the void!” 
Shluh said. "To—” 

"Look at the DV screen.” 

S HLUH twisted his head, 
looked. Against the back- 
ground mist of stars, a shape 
loomed, dark and inert. 

"It is. .a ship!” Shluh said. 
"A monster ship!” 

"That’s her,” Retief said. 
"Nine years and a few months 
out of New Terra on a routine 
mapping mission. The missing 
118 


cruiser — the I VS Terrific” 

"Impossible!” Shluh hissed. 
"The hulk swings in a deep 
cometary orbit.” 

"Right. And now it’s mak- 
ing its close swing past Gro- 
ac.” 

"You think to match orbits 
with the derelict? Without 
power? Our meeting will be a 
violent one, if that is your in- 
tent.” 

"We won’t hit; we’ll make 
our pass at about five thou- 
sand yards.” 

"To what end, Terrestrial? 
You have found your lost 
ship. Then what? Is this 
glimpse worth the death we 
die?” 

"Maybe they’re not dead,” 
Retief said. 

"Not dead?” Shluh lapsed 
into Groacian. "To have died 
in the burrow of one’s youth. 
To have burst my throat sac 
ere I embarked with a mad 
alien to call up the dead.” 

"2396, make it snappy,” Re- 
tief called. The speaker 
crackled heedlessly. The dark 
image on the screen drifted 
past, dwindling now. 

"Nine years, and the mad 
one speaking as to friends,” 
Shluh raved. "Nine years 
dead, and still to seek them.” 

"Another twenty seconds,” 
Retief said softly, "and we’re 
out of range. Look alive, 
boys.” 

"Was this your plan, Re- 
tief?” Shluh asked in Terran. 
"Did you flee Groac and risk 
all on this slender thread?” 

"How long would I have 

by Keith Laumer 



lasted in one of your Groaci 
prisons ?” 

“Long and long, my Retief,” 
Shluh hissed, “under the blade 
of an artist/’ 

Abruptly, the ship trem- 
bled, seemed to drag, rolling 
the two passengers in their 
couches. Shluh hissed as the 
restraining harness cut into 
him. The shuttle boat was piv- 
oting heavily, upending. 
Crushing acceleration forces 
built. Shluh gasped and cried 
out shrilly. 

“What. ..is. ..it?” 

“It looks,” Retief said, “like 
we’ve had a little bit of luck.” 

V 

our second pass,” the 

^ gaunt-faced officer 
said, “they let fly with some- 
thing. I don’t knfow how it got 
past our screens. It socked 
home in the stern and put the 
main pipe off the air. I threw 
full power to the emergency 
shields, and broadcast our 
identification on a scatter that 
should have hit every receiver 
within a parsec. Nothing. 
Then the transmitter blew. I 
was a fool to send the boat 
down but I couldn’t believe, 
somehow. ” 

“In a way it’s lucky you 
did, Captain. That was my 
only lead.” 

“They tried to finish us af- 
ter that. But with full power 
to the screens, nothing they 
had could get through. Then 
they called on us to surren- 
der.” 

TH5 MADMAN FROM EARTH 


Retief nodded. “I take it 
you weren’t tempted?” 

“More than you know. It 
was a long swing out on our 
first circuit. Then, coming 
back in, we figured we’d hit. 
As a last resort I would have 
pulled back power from the 
screens and tried to adjust the 
orbit with the steering jets. 
But the bombardment was 
pretty heavy; I don’t think 
we’d have made it. Then we 
swung past and headed put 
again. We’ve got a three year 
period. Don’t think I didn’t 
consider giving up.” 

“Why didn’t you?” 

“The information we have is 
important. We’ve got plenty 
of stores aboard. Enough for 
another ten years, if neces- 
sary. Sooner or later, I knew 
Search Command would find 
us.” 

Retief cleared his throat. 
“I’m glad you stuck with it. 
Captain. Even a backwater 
world like Groac can kill a lot 
of people when it runs amok.” 

“What I didn’t know,” the 
captain went on, “was that 
we’re not in a stable orbit. 
We’re going to graze atmos- 
phere pretty deeply this pass, 
and in another sixty days we’d 
be back to stay, I guess the 
Groaci would be ready for us.” 

“No wonder they were sit- 
ting on this so tight,” Retief 
said. “They were almost in the 
clear.” 

. “And you’re here now,” the 
captain said. “Nine years, and 
we weren’t forgotten, I knew 
we could count on-r” , 


119 



“It’s over now, Captain, 1 " 
Retief said. "That’s what 
counts." 

"Home," the captain said. 
"After nine years. ." 

{{T’D like to take a look at 

A the films you mentioned," 
Retief said. "The ones show- 
ing the installations on the 
satellite." 

The captain complied. Re- 
tief watched as the scene un- 
rolled, showing the bleak sur- 
face of the tiny moon as the 
Terrific had seen it nine years 
before. 

In harsh black and white, 
row on row of identical hulls 
cast long shadows across the 
pitted metallic surface of the 
satellite. Retief whistled. 

"They had quite a little sur- 
prise in store. Your visit must 
have panicked them." 

"They should be about ready 
to go, by now. Nine years. 

"Hold the picture," Retief 
said suddenly. "What’s that 
ragged black line across the 
plain there?" 

"I think it’s a fissure. The 
crystalline structure — " 

"I’ve got what may be an 
idea," Retief said. "I had a 
look at some classified files 
last night, at the foreign of- 
fice. One was a progress re- 
port on a fissionable stockpile. 
It didn’t make much sense at 
the time. Now I get the pic- 
ture. Which is the ‘north’ end 
of that crevasse?" 

"At the top of the picture." 

"Unless I’m badly mistaken, 
that’s the bomb dump. The 
120 


Groaci like to tuck things un- 
derground. I wonder what a 
direct hit with a fifty mega- 
ton missile would do to it?" 

"If that’s an ordnance stor- 
age dump," the captain said, 
"it’s an experiment I’d like to 
try." 

"Can you hit it?" 

"I’ve got fifty heavy mis- 
siles aboard. If I fire them in 
direct sequence, it should sat- 
urate the defenses. Yes, I can 
hit it." 

"The range isn’t too great?" 

"These are the de luxe mod- 
els," the captain smiled bale- 
fully. "Video guidance. We 
could steer them into a bar 
and park ’em on a stool." 

"What do you say we try 
it?" 

"I’ve been wanting a solid 
target for a long time," the 
captain said. 

R ETIEF waved a hand to- 
ward the screen. 

"That expanding dust cloud 
used to be the satellite of Gro- 
ac, Shluh," he said. "Looks 
like something happened to 
it." 

The police chief stared at 
the picture. 

"Too bad," Retief said. 
"But then it wasn’t of any im- 
portance, was it, Shluh?" 

Shluh muttered incompre- 
hensibly. 

"Just a bare hunk of iron, 
Shluh. That’s what the foreign 
office told me when I asked 
for information." 

"I wish you’d keep your 
prisoner out of sight," the 

by Keith Laumer 



captain said. M I have a hard 
time keeping my hands off 
him.” 

“Shluh wants to help, Cap- 
tain. He’s been a bad boy and 
I have a feeling he’d like to 
cooperate with us now. Es- 
pecially in view of the immi- 
nent arrival of a Terrestrial 
ship, and the dust cloud out 
there.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Captain, you can ride it 
out for another week, contact 
the ship when it arrives, get a 
tow in and your troubles are 
over. When your films are 
shown in the proper quarter, a 
task force will come out here. 
They’ll reduce Groac to a sub- 
technical cultural level, and 
set up a monitor system to in- 
sure she doesn’t get any more 
expansionist ideas. Not that 
she can do much now, with her 
handy iron mine in the sky 
gone.” 

“That’s right; and—” 

“On the other hand,” Retief 
said, “there’s what I might 
call the diplomatic ap- 
proach. .” 

He explained at length. 
The captain looked at him 
thoughtfully. 

“I’ll go along,” he said. 
“What about this fellow?” 

Retief turned to Shluh. The 
Groacian shuddered, eye 
stalks retracted. 

“I will do it,” he said faint- 

iy- 

“Right,” Retief said. “Cap- 
tain, if you’ll have your men 
bring in the transmitter from 
the shuttle, I’ll place a call to 

THE MADMAN FROM EARTH 


a fellow named Fith at the 
foreign office.” He turned to 
Shluh. “And when I get him, 
Shluh, you’ll do everything 
exactly as I’ve told you— or 
have terrestrial monitors dic- 
tating in Groac City.” 

4^/^VUITE candidly, Re- 
^^tief,” Counsellor Pardy 

said, “I’m rather nonplussed. 
Mr. Fith of the foreign office 
seemed almost painfully lav- 
ish in your praise. He seems 
most eager to please you. In 
the light of some of the evi- 
dence I’ve turned up of high- 
ly irregular behavior on your 
part, it’s difficult to under- 
stand.” 

“Fith and I have been 
through a lot together,” Re- 
tief said. “We understand 
each other.” 

“You have no cause for com- 
placency, Retief,” Pardy said. 
“Miss Meuhl was quite justi- 
fied in reporting your case. Of 
course, had she known that 
you were assisting Mr. Fith in 
his marvelous work, she would 
have modified her report 
somewhat, no doubt. You 
should have confided in her.” 
“Fith wanted to keep it se- 
cret, in case it didn’t work 
out,” Retief said. “You know 
how it is.” 

“Of course. And as soon as 
Miss Meuhl recovers from her 
nervous breakdown, there’ll be 
a nice promotion awaiting her. 
The girl more than deserves it 
for her years of unswerving 
devotion to Corps policy.” 
“Unswerving,” Retief said. 

121 



‘Til sure go along with that.” 
“As well you may, Retief. 
You’ve not acquitted yourself 
well in this assignment. Tm, 
arranging for a transfer. 
You’ve alienated too many of 
the local people. .” 

“But as you said, Fith 
speaks highly of me. .” 

“Oh, true. It’s the cultural 
intelligentsia I’m referring to. 
M iss Meuhl’s records show 
that you deliberately affront- 
ed a number of influential 
groups by boycotting — ” 

“Tone deaf,” Retief said. 
“To me a Groacian blowing a 
nose-whistle sounds like a 
Groacian blowing a nose-whis- 
tle.” 

“You have to come to terms 
with local aesthetic values,” 
Pardy explained. “Learn to 
know the people as they really 
are. It’s apparent from some 
of the remarks Miss Meuhl 
quoted in her report that you 
held the Groaci in rather low 
esteem. But how wrong you 
were Ail the while, they were 
working unceasingly to res- 
cue those brave lads marooned 
aboard our cruiser. They 
pressed on even after we our- 
selves had abandoned the 
search. And when they discov-

ered that it had been a col- 
1 i s i o n with their satellite 
which disabled the craft, they 
made that magnificent gesture 
— unprecedented. One hun- 
dred thousand credits in gold 
to each crew member, as a 
token of Groacian sympthy.” 
“A handsome gesture,” Re- 
tief murmured. 

6iT hope, Retief, that you’ve 
-I- learned from this inci- 
dent. In view of the helpful 
part you played in advising 
Mr. Fith in matters of proce- 
dure to assist in his search, 
I’m not recommending a re- 
duction in grade. We’ll over- 
look the affair, give you a 
clean slate. But in future, I’ll 
be watching you closely.” 
“You can’t win ’em all,” Re- 
tief said. 

“You’d better pack up. 
You’ll be coming along with 
us in the morning.” Pardy 
shuffled his papers together. 

“I’m sorry,” he said, “that I 
can’t file a more flattering re- 
port on you. I would have 
liked to recommend your pro- 
mo t i o n, along with Miss 
Meuhl’s.” 

“That’s okay,” Retief said. 
“I have my memories.” END

★ TERROR ★ 

Things just vanished. It was 
simple. As a matter of 
fact, it was child's play! 


BY R. A. LAFFERTY 


({TS there anything you want 
“*“to make disappear?” Clar- 
ence Willoughby asked his 
mother. 

“A sink full of dishes is all 
I can think of. How will you 
do it?” 

“I just built a disappeared 
All you do is cut the other end 
out of a beer can. Then you 
take two pieces of red card- 
board with peepholes in the 
middle and fit them in the 
ends. You look through the 
peepholes and blink. What- 
ever you look at will disap- 
pear.” 

“Oh.” 

“But I don’t know if I can 
make them come back. We’d 
better try it on something 
else* Dishes cost money.” 

As always, Myra Willough- 
by had to admire the wisdom 
of her nine-year-old son. She 
would not have had such fore- 


sight herself. He always did. 

“You can try it on Blanche 
Manners’ cat outside there. 
Nobody will care if it disap- 
pears except Blanche Man- 
ners.” 

“All right.” 

He put the disappearer to 
his eye and blinked. The cat 
disappeared from the sidewalk 
outside. 

His mother was interested. 
“I wonder how it works. Do 
you know how it works?” 

“Yes. You take a beer can 
with both ends cut out and 
put in two pieces of card- 
board. Then you blink.” 

“Never mind. Take it out- 
side and play with it. You 
hadn’t better make anything 
disappear in here till I think 
about this.” 

But when he had gone his 
mother was oddly disturbed, 

“I wonder if I have a pre- 

123 




cocious child. Why, there*s 
lots of grown people who 
wouldn’t know how to make a 
disappearer that would work. 
I wonder if Blanche Manners 
will miss her cat very much?” 
Clarence went down to the 
Plugged Nickel, a pot house 
on the corner. 

“Do you have anything you 
want to make disappear, No- 
komis?” 

“Only my paunch.” 

“If I make it disappear it’ll 
leave a hole in you and you’ll 
bleed to death.” 

“That’s right, I would. Why 
don’t you try it on the fire 
plug outside?” 

T HIS in a way was one of 
the happiest afternoons 
ever in the neighborhood. The 
children came from blocks 
around to play in the flooded 
streets and gutters, and if 
some of them drowned (and 
we don’t say that they did 
drown) in the flood (and 
brother! it was a flood), why, 
you have to expect things like 
that. The fire engines (who- 
ever heard of calling fire en- 
gines to put out a flood?) 
were apparatus-deep in the 
water. The policemen and am- 
bulance men wandered around 
wet and bewildered. 

“Resuscitator, resuscitator, 
anybody wanna resuscitator,” 
chanted Clarissa Willoughby. 

“Oh, shut up,” said the am- 
bulance attendants. 

Nokomis, the bar man in the 
Plugged Nickel, called Clar- 
ence aside, 

124 


“I don’t believe, just for the 
moment, I’d tell anyone what 
happened to that fire plug,” 
he said. 

“I won’t tell if you won’t 
tell,” said Clarence. 

Officer Comstock was sus- 
picious. “There’s only seven 
possible explanations. One of 
the seven Willoughby kids 
did it. I dunno how. It’d take 
a bulldozer to do it, and then 
there’d be something left of 
the plug. But however they 
did it, one of them did it.” 

Officer Comstock had a tal- 
ent for getting near the truth 
of dark matters. This is why 
he was walking a beat out 
here in the boondocks instead 
of sitting in a chair down- 
town. 

“Clarissa!” said Officer 
Comstock in a voice like thun- 
der. 

“Resuscitator, resuscitator, 
anybody wanna resuscitator?” 
chanted Clarissa. 

“Do you know what hap- 
pened to that fire plug?” 
asked officer C. 

“I have an uncanny sus- 
picion. As yet it is no more 
than that. When I am better 
informed I will advise you.” 

Clarissa was eight years old 
and much given to uncanny 
suspicions. 

“Clementine, Harold, Cor- 
inne, Jimmy, Cyril,” he asked 
the five younger Willoughby 
children. “Do you know what 
happened to that fire plug?” 

“There was a man around 
yesterday. I bet he took it,” 
said Clementine.

“I don’t even remember a 
fire plug there. I think you’re 
making a lot of fuss about 
nothing,” said Jferold. 

“City hall’s going to hear 
about this,” said Corinne. 

“Pretty dommed sure,” said 
Jimmy, “but I won’t tell.” 

“Cyril!” cried Office* Com- 
stock in a terrible voice. Not 
a terrifying voice, a terrible 
voice. He felt terrible now. 

“Great green bananas,” said 
Cyril, “I’m only three years 
old. I don’t see how it’s even 
my responsibility.” 

“Clarence,” said Officer 
Comstock. 

Clarence gulped. 

“Do you know where that 
fire plug went?” 

Clarence brightened. “No, 
sir. I don’t know where it 
went.” 

A bunch of smart alecs 
from the water department 
came out and shut off the wa- 
ter for a few blocks around 
and put some kind of cap on 
in place of the fire plug. 
“This sure is going to be a 
funny-sounding report,” said 
one of them. 

Officer Comstock walked 
away discouraged. “D o n ’ t 
bother i|5e, Miss Manners,” he 
said. “I don’t know where to 
look fhr your cat. I don’t even 
know where to look for a fire 
plug.” 

“I have an idea,” said Clar- 
issa, “that when you find the 
cat you will find the fire plug 
the same place. As yet it is 
only an idea.” 

Ozzie Murphy wore a little 

SEVEN-DAY TERROR 


hat on top of his head. Clar- 
ence pointed his weapon and 
winked. The hat was no long- 
er there, but a little trickle of 
blood was running down the 
pate. 

“I don’t believe I’d play 
with that any more,” said No- 
komis. 

“Who’s playing?” said Clar- 
ence. “This is for real.” 

T HIS was the beginning of 
the seven-day terror in the 
heretofore obscure neighbor- 
hood. Trees disappeared from 
the parkings ; lamp posts were 
as though they had never 
been; Wally Waldorf drove 
home, got out, slammed the 
door of his car, and there was 
no car. As George Mullendorf 
came up the walk to his house 
his dog Pete ran to meet him 
and took a flying leap to his 
arms. The dog left the side- 
walk but something hap- 
pened; the dog was gone and 
only a bark lingered for a mo- 
ment in the puzzled air. 

But the worst were the fire- 
plugs. The second plug was 
installed the morning after 
the disappearance of the first. 
In eight minutes it was gone 
and the flood waters returned. 
Another one was in by twelve 
o’clock. Within three minutes 
it had vanished. The next 
morning fire plug number 
four was installed. 

The water commissioner 
was there, the city engineer 
was there, the chief of police 
was there with a riot squad, 
the president of the parent- 

125 



teachers association was there, 
the president of the Univer- 
sity was there, the mayor was 
there, three gentlemen of the 
F.B.I., a newsreel photogra- 
pher, eminent scientists and a 
crowd of honest citizens. 

“Let's see it disappear 
now," said the city engineer. 

“Let's see it disappear 
now," said the police chief. 

“Let’s see it disa — it did, 
didn’t it?" said one of the emi- 
nent scientists. 

And it was gone and every- 
body was very wet. 

“At least I have the picture 
sequence of the year,” said the 
photographer. But his camera 
and apparatus disappeared 
from the midst of them. 

“Shut off the water and cap 
it,” said the commissioner. 
“And don't put in another 
plug yet. That was the last 
plug in the warehouse." 

“This is too big for me,” 
said the mayor. “I wonder 
that Tass doesn’t have it yet.” 

“Tass has it,” said a little 
round man. “I am Tass.” 

“If all of you gentlemen 
will come into the Plugged 
Nickel,” said Nokomis, “and 
try one of our new Fire Hy- 
drant Highballs you will all 
be happier. These are made of 
good corn whisky, brown sug- 
ar and hydrant water from 
this very gutter. You can be 
the first to drink them." 

Business was phenomenal at 
the Plugged Nickel, for it was 
in front of its very doors that 
the fire plugs disappeared in 
floods of gushing water.

“I know a way we can get 
rich," said Clarissa several 
days later to her father, Tom 
Willoughby. “Everybody says 
they’re going to sell their 
houses for nothing and move 
out of the neighborhood. Go 
get a lot of money and buy 
them all. Then you can sell 
them again and get rich.” 

“I wouldn’t buy them for a 
dollar each. Three of them 
have disappeared already, and 
all the families but us have 
their furniture moved out in 
their front yards. There 
might be nothing but vacant 
lots in the morning." 

“Good, then buy the vacant 
lots. And you can be ready 
when the houses come back.” 
“Come back? Are the houses 
going to come back? Do you 
know anything about this, 
young lady?” 

“I have a suspicion verging 
on a certainty. As of now I 
can say no more." 

T HREE eminent scientists 
were gathered in an untidy 
suite that looked as though it 
belonged to a drunken sultan. 

“This transcends the meta- 
physical. It impinges on the 
quantum continuum. In some 
ways it obsoletes Boff," said 
Dr. Velikof Vonk. 

“The contingence on the in- 
transigence is the most mysti- 
fying aspect,” said Arpad 
Arkabaranan. 

“Yes,” said Willy McGilly. 
“Who would have thought 
that you: could do it with a 
beer can and two pieces of 

by R. A. L*fferty 



cardboard? When I was a boy 
I used an oatmeal box and red 
crayola.” 

“I do not always follow 
you,” said Dr. Vonk. “I wish 
you would speak plainer.” 

So far no human had been 
injured or disappeared — ex- 
cept for a little blood on the 
pate of Ozzie Murphy, on the 
lobes, of Conchita when her 
gaudy earrings disappeared 
from her very ears, a clipped 
finger or so when a house 
vanished as the front door 
knob was touched, a lost toe 
when a neighborhood boy 
kicked at a can and the can 
was not; probably not more 
than a pint of blood and three 
or four ounces of flesh all to- 
gether. 

New, however, Mr. Buckle 
the grocery man disappeared 
before witnesses. This was se- 
rious. 

Some mean-looking investi- 
gators from downtown came 
out to the Willoughbys. The 
oj-anest-looking one was the 
mayor. In happier days he had 
not been a mean man, but the 
terror had now reigned for 
seven days. 

“There have been ugly ru- 
mors,” said one of the mean 
investigators, “that link cer- 
tain events to this household. 
Do any of you know anything 
about them?” 

“I started most of them,’’ 
said Clarissa. “But I didn’t 
consider them ugly. Cryptic, 
rather. But if you want to get 
to the bottom of this just ask 
me a question.” '■ J 

SEVEN-DAY TERROR 


“Did you make those things 
disappear?” asked the invests 
gator. 

“That isn’t the question,” 
said Clarissa. 

“Do you know where they 
have gone?” asked the inves- 
tigator. 

“That isn’t the question ei^ 
ther,” said Clarissa. 

“Can you make them come 
back?” 

■•Why, of course I can. Any- 
body can. Can’t you?” 

“I cannot. If you can, please 
do so at once.” 

“I need some stuff. Get me 
a gold watch and a hammer. 
Then go down to the drug 
store and get me this list of 
chemical. And I need a yard 
of black velvet and a pound of 
rock candy.” 

“Shall we?” asked one of 
the investigators. 

“Yes,” said the mayor, “it’s 
our only hope. Get her any- 
thing she wants.” 

And it was all assembled. 

a W HY does she get all the 
** attention?” asked Clar- 
ence. “I was the one that made 
all the things disappear. How 
does she know how to get 
them back?” 

“I knew it!” cried Clarissa 
with hate. “I knew he was the 
one that did it. He read in my 
diary how to make a disap- 
pearer. If I was his mother I’d 
whip him for reading his lit- 
tle sister’s diary. That’s what 
happens when things like that 
fall mto irresponsible hands:” 

She poised the hammer trver 

127 



the gold watch of the mayor 
on the floor. 

“I have to wait a few sec- 
onds. This can't be hurried. 
It'll be only a little while.” 

The second hand swept 
around to the point that was 
preordained for it before the 
world began. Clarissa sudden- 
ly brought down the hammer 
with all her force on the beau- 
tiful gold watch. 

“That's all ” she said. “Your 
troubles are over. See, there is 
Blanche Manners' cat on the 
sidewalk just where she was 
seven days ago.” 

And the cat was back. 

“Now let's go down to the 
Plugged Nickel and watch the 
fire plug come back.” 

They had only a f ew min- 
utes to wait. It came from no- 
where and clanged into the 
street like a sign and a wit- 
ness. 

“Now I predict/' said Clar- 
issa, “that every single object 
will return exactly seven days 
from the time of its disap- 
pearance.” 

The seven-day terror had 
ended. The objects began to 
reappear. 

“How,” asked the mayor, 
“did you know they would 
come back in seven days?” 


“Because it was a seven-day 
disappearer that Clarence 
made. I also know how to 
make a nine-day, a thirteen- 
day, a twenty-seven-day, and 
an eleven-year disappearer. I 
was going to make a thirteen- 
day one, but for that you have 
to color the ends with the 
blood from a little boy’s heart, 
and Cyril cried every time I 
tried to make a good cut.” 
“You really know how to 
make all of these?” 

“Yes. But I shudder if the 
knowledge should ever come 
into unauthorized hands.” 

“I shudder too, Clarissa. 
But tell me, why did you want 
the chemicals?” 

“For my chemistry set.” 
“And the black velvet?” 
“For doll dresses.” 

“And the pound of rock 
candy?” 

“How did you ever get to be 
mayor of this town if you 
have to ask questions like 
that? What do you think I 
wanted the rock candy for?” 
“One last question,” said the 
mayor. “Why did you smash 
my gold watch with the ham- 
mer?” 

“Oh,” said Clarissa, “that 
was for dramatic effect.”

Dear Editor, 

If is certainly getting bet- 
ter. The thing that most need- 
ed changing was If*s cover. It 
had a poor design, and was of- 
ten poorly drawn. I'm sure If 
has increased in popularity 
since the November and Jan- 
uary issues hit the news- 
stands. 

Next, the letter col. Despite 
all the griping, four or five 
pages is the perfect size for it. 
Congratulations. 

As far as the other features 
go, I have a rather unusual 
plan. Take Sturgeon out of 
the special feature department 
and get him to write your 
book review column. You will 
recall that he wrote book re- 
views for the late, lamented 
Venture , and did admirably. 


You should take out Science 
Briefs entirely. It just doesn't 
fit the mag. However, make 
your editorials regular, please. 
The most important part of 
the mag, of course, is the sto- 
ries. At the End of the Orbit, 
by Arthur C. Clarke, was one 
of the best stories I've read in 
If. The stories in If, which 
have always been interesting 
and amusing, are beginning to 
show some seriousness. 

Science fiction is once 
again on the upswing.

Dear Incumbent: 

Ah, the contents page: 
“All Stories New and Corn- 

129 



plete”. /‘NOVEL— First of 
Two Parts/' Do I note a dis- 
crepancy here? I suspect I do. 
I hate to say it in public, but 
this is the first Doc Smith 
yarn I’ve had a chance to read 
. it's good, though. Some- 
body at a recent ESFA meet- 
ing said that it’s mainly Doc's 
story, as he rewrote it almost 
completely when E. E. Evans 
passed on. Somebody also 
said that it’s been cut 10,000 
words, but I don’t want to be- 
lieve that . 

Clarke’s story is another in 
his “Isn’t everything ironic?” 
philosophy. Dull and wasted. 
Ken Bulmer’s novelette is the 
second-best thing in thish, but 
his one in the Septish was bet- 
ter than this later adventure 
of Retief. In his “Keith Lau- 
mer” guise, Bulmer seems to 
be writing good action/adven- 
ture stories.

Dear Editor, 

First things first: the cov- 
er. The covers on If have been 
failing to satisfy, lately. 
They’re not bad covers, they 
just don’t arouse my interest. 
130 


Perhaps the best word for 
them is “trite.” They are stale, 
stock situations, hardly suited 
to a sf magazine. What is 
wanted are covers in which 
something intriguing is hap- 
pening, but you have to read 
the magazine to find out what. 
Covers that do not relate to 
the contents I consign to the 
lower regions. 

The stories are for the most 
part good to adequate, very 
seldom falling into the poor 
class, which is, of course, what 
keeps me reading If. I do 
think an occasional top author 
with a really good story 
would liven things up a bit. 
Among the better ones you 
have been using is Keith Lau- 
mer. Quite enjoyed his last.

* Top author? How about An- 
derson’s really fine job this is- 
sue? Covers and interior art

can see in this issue. — Ed.

That does it for another 

month. Thanks to all who 

have written letters — those 
printed above, and those 
which aren’t. (And we’d print 
a lot more if you’d write 

shorter notes!) 

We do read — and when pos- 
sible act on — all letters. For 
example, the one feature in If 
that had not a single defend- 
er was our unlamented car- 
toon page. As you see, it’s 
gone.
