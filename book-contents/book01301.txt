Seconds on Firsts 



C ' 1 ary Wright’s The Ultimate 
J Racer, which starts on page 64 
ol this issue, is the first case of a 
“first” turning up with a second 
story in print in our magazines . 
Put mostly because of the accidents 
of timing. We have a notion you’ll 
be hearing a lot from a good many 
of them. 

As most regular readers know, in 
each issue we bring you a story by 
someone who has never appeared in 
a professional science-fiction maga- 
zine before (usually they haven’t ap- 
peared anywhere at all, professional 
or otherwise). This issue’s, for ex- 
ample, is Simon Tully’s The Perfect 
People — and we think you will 
agree that the author, an Australian 
anthropologist now resident in Lon- 
don, is the right person to tell us 
what “perfection” may mean. 

Gary Wright gave us a fine, ad- 
venturous novelette called Captain oj 
the Kali in January 1963. Readers 
liked it and asked for more — and, 
at last, we’ve been able to deliver. 
Jonathan Brand, whose Long Day in 
Court was one of the most popular 
of our firsts, has a story called Van- 
ishing Point in our inventory and 
coming up soon. Bruce McAllister, 
who was fourteen years old when he 
sold us his “first” and thus became 
the youngest of our contributors, has 
just produced another which we ex- 
pect to bring you in short order. 
Larry Niven, whose first hasn’t even 
appeared yet — it’s called The Cold- 
est Place, and will turn up next 



month — has already sold us a sec- 
ond which will be appearing shortly 
in Galaxy, called Wrong-Way Street. 
And another “first” who will short- 
ly be coming up in Galaxy is Joseph 
Green, our first “first” of all, who 
inaugurated the idea three years ago 
and has since carved out an audi- 
ence for himself with a number of 
short stories and a forthcoming Bal- 
lantine book. 

T he whole “first” idea started at 
the Seattle Science Fiction Con- 
vention of 1961, when the conven- 
tion committee auctioned off the 
time of a number of guests, includ- 
ing your editor. (The price we fetch- 
ed for 30 minutes was fifteen dollars. 
Shows what inflation will do.) The 
high bidder was Joe Green, who 
used the time to find out all he 
could about what it took to sell sci- 
ence-fiction stories . and, as you 
see, got his money’s worth at that. 

To our way of thinking, the “first” 
series has been about the most satis- 
factory venture we’ve engaged in 
with If. There are others in which 
we take pride — bringing back writ- 
ers like Van Vogt and Doc Smith, 
developing the Relief series, etc. — 
but this is the one that we think is 
going to have the greatest long- 
range effect. 

These new writers — they’re the 
Doc Smiths and Van Vogts of to- 
morrow. We’re proud to say that 
they’ve got their start in If\

THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

HELL 






FIRST OF TWO PARTS 




Illustrated by EMSH 



They came not to destroy the 
human race but to preserve it, 
protect it — and then crop it! 



I t was ten minutes past high noon 
when I paid off my helicab, 
ducked under the air blast from the 
caged high-speed rotors as they 



whined back to speed, and looked 
around at the sun-scalded, dust- 
white, mob-noisy bazaar of the fra- 
ctal camp-city of Tamboula, Repub- 
lic of Free Algeria. 

Merchants’ stalls were a clash of 



7 






garish fabrics, the pastels of heaped 
fruit, the glitter of oriental gold 
thread and beadwork, the glint of 
polished Japanese lenses and finely 
machined Swedish chromalloy, the 
subtle gham of hand rubbed wood, 
the brittle complexity of Hong Kong 
plastic — islands in the tide of hu- 
manity that elbowed, sauntered, bar- 
gained with shrill voices and waving 
haDds or stood idly in patches of 
black shadow under rigged awnings 
all across the wide square. 1 made 
my way through the press, shouted 
at by hucksters, solicited by whiniDg 
beggars and tattooed drabs, jostled 
by UN Security Police escorting of- 
ficials of a dozen nations, emerged 
on a badly paved street of starved 
royal palms across from a row of 
fast-decaying buildings as cosmopo- 
litan in style as the costumes around 
me. Above the cacophony of the 
mob, keening Arab music shrilled 
from cave- like openings redolent of 
goat and curry, vying with the PA- 
borne blare of Jump and Jitter, re- 
flecting hectic lunch-hours behind 
the sweat-dewed glass fronts of the 
Cafe Parisien, Die Valkyrie, the 
Samovar and the Chicago Snackery. 

I crossed the street, dodging the 
iron-shod wheels of ox-carts, the 
scorching exhaust of jet-peds, the 
stinging dust-barrage of cushion 
cars, snorting one almost palpable 
stench from my nostrils just in time 
to catch a new and even riper one. 
Under a ten-foot glare sign lettered 
ALHAMBRA ROOM in phony 
Arabic script, a revolving door 
thumped monotonously. I caught it, 
went through into a sudden gloom 
and silence. 1 crossed an unswept 



mosaic floor, went down three steps 
into an even darker room with a 
scatter of gaudy cushions and a 
gleam of gold filligree. I waved 
away a yard-square red and gold 
menu proffered by a nicely rounded 
harem slave in a brief vest and 
transparent trousers and took a 
stool at the long bar. A bare-chested 
three hundred pound eunuch in a 
sash, cutlass and turban took my 
order, slid a frosty glass across the 
polished black marble. Behind a 
screen of gilded palm fronds, a 
small combo made reedy music. 

I took a long, thirsty draught, 
From the corner of my eye I saw 
a man slide onto the next stool. 
Casually I angled the ring on my 
left forefinger. Its specular surface 
reflected a narrow, tanned face with 
a bald forehead, peaked white eye- 
brows, a Kaiser Wilhelm mustache, 
and a Satanic Van Dyck. A pair of 
frosty blue eyes met mine for an 
instant in the tiny mirror. 

“What’s the get-up for, Felix?” 
I said softly. “You traveling in hair 
goods now?” 

H is eyelids flickered. For Felix 
Severance, that was equivalent 
to a yelp of astonishment. Then he 
gave me the trick wink that was 
service code for ‘The Enemy May 
Be Listening’. 

“Well, well, John Bravais, as I 
live and breathe,” he said in his 
high-pitched voice. “Fancy meeting 
you here!” 

We went through a ritual of hand 
pumping and when-did-I-see-you- 
last’s, ordered second drinks, then 
moved over to a low table. He

IF 




slipped a small gadget from a pock- 
et, glanced around to see who was 
watching, ran it over the light fix- 
ture, the salt and pepper shakers, 
the ashtray, babbling on: 

“Martha’s fine. Little Herbie had 
a touch of Chinese Virus, and Char- 
lotte broke a clavicle . He went 
on point like a hunting dog, picked 
up a small tabukuk in the form of 
a frog-goddess, dropped it incon- 
spicuously into his heavy briefcase. 

“I heard you were going into 
mink farming,” I carried on the 
charade. 

“Decided against it, Johnny,” he 
said, checking the spice tray. “Too 
damned vicious. Lousy example for 
little Lennie and Bertha and the 
others.” He finished the check, 
switched off the patter in mid- 
sentence, pocketed the spy-eye de- 
tector. 

“Okay, Johnny,” he said softly. 
“My little gem-dandy patented nose- 
counter says we’re clean now.” He 
was looking me over with that quick 
glance of his that could count the 
pearls on a dowager’s neck while 
he was bowing over her wrist. 
“Thanks for coming.” 

“I haven’t run to fat yet, if that’s 
what’s bothering you,” I said. “Now 
stop sizing me up and tell me what 
the false beard is all about. I heard 
you were here under an open cover 
as a UN medic.” 

“I’m afraid Medecine-Major de 
Salle attracted some unwelcome at- 
tention.” He grinned. “It seems I 
broached Security. I was advised to 
consider myself under house arrest; 
a six-footer with a side-arm was 
assigned to make the point clear. I 



ditched him in the first dark alley 
we passed and faded from the 
scene. A school teacher named 
Brown rented the de Salle villa after 
the disappearance — but as Brown, 
I’m not free to move. That’s where 
you enter the picture.” 

“Come to the point, Felix. What 
was so important that I had to come 
nine thousand miles in thirteen 
hours to hear? Do you know where 
I was — ” 

He held up a hand. “I know; 
Barnett told me you’d spent seven 
months in Bolivia building a cover 
as a disgruntled veteran of Colonna’s 
Irregulars. Sorry and all that.” 
“Another week and I’d have 
landed an assignment running a 
shipment of bootleg surgical spares.” 
“The frozen kidneys will have to 
wait for another time.” He showed 
me a Mephistophelean smile. “What 
I have is far more fun.” 

“The suspense is unnerving me. 
Go ahead and spill it.” 

“All right. Let’s begin with the 
world situation.” 

“I’d prefer a more cheerful sub- 
ject — like cancer.” 

“We may get to that, too, before 
this one’s over.” He hitched himself 
forward, getting down to business 
now. “For most of the last century, 
John, the world has been at war. 
We haven’t called it that, of course 
— nobody’s actually used nuclear 
warheads. These are nothing but 
‘police action’, or ‘internal power 
realignments’, like the current rum- 
ble here in Algeria: maneuvers with 
live ammunition. But while the pow- 
ers are whetting their claws on 
these tupp’y-ap’ny shooting matches, 



THE HOUNDS OF HELL

they’re looking hard for a weapon 
that would give one state a decisive 
advantage. In the meantime — stale- 
mate.” 

“Well,” I said, pushing back my 
chair, “that was mighty interesting, 
Felix. Thanks for letting me know.” 
He leaned across the table. There 
was a merry glint in his eye — like 
a devil planning a barbecue. 

“We’ve found that weapon, John.” 

1 settled back into my chair. “All 
right, I’m listening.” 

“Very well: Super Hellbombs are 
out. The answer lies in the other 
direction, of course. A crowd of 
infantrymen killing each other isn’t 
war. It’s good, healthy sport — just 
the ticket for working off those 
perfectly natural aggressions that 
might otherwise cause trouble. But 
what if a division or two of foot 
soldiers suddenly became irresistible? 
Impervious to attack, deadly on the 
offensive? Your cosy little brushfire 
war would turn into a rout for the 
unlucky side. And there would go 
your power-balance, shot all to Hell.” 
“How much better can hand- 
weapons get? The Norge Combat 
Imperial weighs six pounds and fires 
a hundred armor-piercing rounds per 
second. It’s radar-aimed and dead- 
accurate — ” 

“I’m talking about something new, 
John. We call it PAPA. Power As- 
sisted Personal Armament. What it 
means is — the Invulnerable Man.” 
I watched Felix swallow half his 
drink, put the glass down, and sit 
back with his fingertips together, 
waiting for my reaction. I nodded 
casually. 

to 



“That’s an old idea,” I said care- 
lessly. “I used to follow Batman and 
Robin myself.” 

“This isn't a Tri-D drama. It’s a 
coordinated development in bio- 
prosthetics, neurosurgery, and myo- 
electronics. Picture it, John! Micro - 
tronics - engineered sense - boosters, 
wide-spectrum vision, artificially ac- 
celerated reflexes, nerve-energy laser- 
type weapons, all surgically implant- 
ed — plus woven-chromalloy body- 
mail, aligned-crystal metal caps for 
fingerbones, shins, ribs, and skull, 
servo-boosted helical titanium fibre 
reinforced musculature — ” 

“You left out the fast-change long- 
jobns with the big red S on them. 
You know, I always wondered why 
Clark Kent never got himself ar- 
rested in an alley for indecent ex- 
posure.” 

“I had a hand in its development 
myself,” Felix went on imperturb- 
ably. “And I can tell you it’s big. 
You have no idea.” 

“But I’d like to have,” I cut in. 
“Especially an idea of what it is I 
blew a year’s work to hear.” 

He nodded. “I’m just coming to 
that. For the past six months I’ve 
been here in Tamboula, carrying out 
a study of battle wounds — data we 
require in the further development 
of PAPA. And I’ve turned up a 
disquieting fact.” He poked a finger 
at me for emphasis. “The number of 
men reported ‘missing in action’ 
amounts to nearly twenty per cent 
of the total casualties.” 

“There are always a few reluc 
tant warriors who go over the hill,” 
I started. 

“Not in the desert, John. I went 

IF 




on then to take a look at civilian 
missing persons figures. The world 
total is close to the two million 
mark annually; naturally, this doesn’t 
include data from China and Red 
India, where one less mouth to feed 
is noted with relief, if at all. And 
the Society of American Morticians 
and Embalmers reports that not 
enough people are being buried.” 

ttT can tell you where part of 
J. them are going,” I said. “The 
black market in human organs — ” 
“Yes,” Felix nodded. “Doubtless 
that nefarious trade accounts for 
some of the discrepancy, particularly 
in burial figures. But suppose, John, 
that someone were building up a 
secret force — and outfitting it with 
an enemy version of PAPA?” 
“Yon can’t hide men in those 
numbers,” 1 said. “The logistical 
problems alone — ” 

“I know; but the men are going 
somewhere. 1 need to know where.” 
“Pm afraid I’m beginning to get 
the picture; you want me to find 
them.” 

“You still hold your reserve Army 
commission, I take it?” 

I nodded. 

“Good. I have your recall orders 
in my briefcase. They’re perfectly 
legal; 1 made them myself. You’re a 
Defense Department observer. I’ve 
arranged for you to occupy one of 
our rooms at the King Feisal.” 

“I thought CBI assignments were 
on a voluntary basis.” 

Felix raised the white eyebrows. 
“You are volunteering, aren’t you?” 
“I suppose the fact that I’m here 
answers that one.” 



“Of course. Now, there’s a battle 
scheduled soon. I haven’t been able 
to find out just when, but I did 
procure copies of the Utter Top 
Secret Battle Plans for both the Free 
Algerians and the Imperial Moroc- 
cans. Death penalty for possession, 
of course.” He took a newspaper 
from an inner pocket — a much- 
folded copy of the Belfast Messen- 
ger — and dropped it on the table. 

“What am I supposed to do? Stand 
around on a hilltop with a pair of 
binoculars and watch where the men 
disappear to?” 

Felix smiled — an expression half- 
way between a fox and a wolf. 

“I have a few gadgets for you to 
field-test. Find out when that battle’s 
scheduled, and I think you’ll be 
able to take a look at just about 
whatever you want to.” 

I took the newspaper. “So I’m 
back in uniform. I suppose I’d bet- 
ter check in with the UN Monitor 
General.” 

“Send a card over. Perhaps it’ll 
pass unnoticed in the daily mail. 
I want you to hold your official 
contacts to the minimum. Stay clear 
of the Embassy, the police, and the 
press corps. Your other instructions 
are with your orders. You’ll find a 
tight-band communicator with fhe 
rest of the equipment. Keep in touch 
with me, John — but don’t try to 
contact me at the villa unless it’s 
absolutely necessary.” 

“You’ve made some pretty elabor- 
ate arrangements. This sort of thing 
costs money. Who’s footing the 
bill?” 

“Let’s just say it comes from a 
special fund.” He finished his drink. 



THE HOUNDS OF HELL

"Go on over to the Feisal, get set- 
tled, and take a look around. I’ll 
expect a preliminary report in a day 
or two.” He stood, replaced the 
tabukuk on the table, gave me a 
quick handshake and was gone. 

I picked up the newspaper, leafed 
through. There were sheets of flim- 
sy paper folded between the pages. 
I caught a glimpse of tiny print, ter- 
rain diagrams, the words Utter Top 
Secret. I folded it and took the last 
swallow of my gin. It seemed as mild 
as spring water suddenly. I dropped 
a five cee note on the table, tucked 
the paper under my arm and tried 
to look casual as I went outside to 
hail a cab. 

II 

T he King Feisal Hotel was a two- 
hundred story specimen of gov- 
ernment-financed construction out 
of Hollywood by the Arabian Nights, 
scarred by five years of North Afri- 
can sun and no maintenance. I paid 
off my helicab in the shade of 
thirty yards of cracked glass mar- 
quee, managed my own bags through 
a mixed crowd of shiny-suited offi- 
cials, Algerian and Moroccan offi- 
cers mingling quite peaceably out- 
side business hours, beggars in color- 
ful costumes featuring wrist-watches 
and tennis shoes, Arab guides in 
traditional white lapel-suits, hot- 
looking tourists, journalists with cof- 
fee hangovers, and stolid-faced UN 
police in short pants with hard- 
wood billies. 

I went up the wide steps and 
past potted yuccas and a uniformed 
Berber doorman with a bad eye 



that bored into me like a hot poker. 
I crossed the lobby to the registra- 
tion console, slapped the counter 
and announced my arrival in tones 
calculated to dispel any appearance 
of shyness on my part. A splay- 
footed Congolese bellhop sidled up 
to listen as I produced the tele- 
printed confirmation of my reserva- 
tion Felix had supplied, asked for 
and received verbal assurances that 
the water was potable and was 
directed to a suite on the forty-fifth 
level. 

It was a pleasant enough apart- 
ment: a spacious sitting room with 
old-fashioned aluminum and teak- 
veneer furniture, a polished com- 
position floor and framed post-neo- 
surrealist paintings, adjoining a car- 
peted bedroom with a four-foot tri- 
D screen, a wide closet and a win- 
dow opening onto a view of ir- 
regular brickwork across a twelve- 
foot alley. Behind the flowered 
wallpaper, there were other facili- 
ties, unknown to the present man- 
agement, installed during construc- 
tion at the insistence of one of the 
more secret agencies of the now 
defunct South African Federation. 

According to the long, chatty 
briefing paper Felix had tucked in 
the newspaper, the CBI had in- 
herited the installation from a form- 
er tenant in return for a set of un- 
registered fingerprints and a get- 
away stake. 

I looked the room over, spotted 
a spy-eye in a drawer knob, a micro- 
phone among the artificial flowers — 
standard equipment at the Feisal, 
no doubt. I would have to make a 
thorough examination of everything 



12 



IF 




my first order of business — as soon 
as I had a cold shower. 

I turned to the bedroom — and 
stopped dead. My right hand made 
a tentative move toward my gun 
and from the shadows a soft voice 
said. “Uh-uh.” 

H e came through the sitting room 
door with a gun in his hand, 
a middle-sized, neatly dressed man 
with wispy hair receding from a 
freckled forehead, quick eyes, an 
inch of clean, white cuff showing 
at his wrist. 

“I was supposed to be gone when 
you got here,” he said in a quiet 
voice. “The boys downstairs slipped 
up.” 

“Sure,” I said. “They slipped up 
— and I’m dancing tonight with the 
Ballet Russe.” I looked at the gun. 
“What was I supposed to do, fall 
down and cry when I saw that?” 
He pinkened a little around the 
ears. “It was merely a precaution 
in the event you panicked.” He 
pocketed the gun, flipped back a 
lapel to flash some sort of badge. 
“UN Police,” he stated, as though 
I had asked. “Regulations require 
all military observers to report to 
UN Headquarters on arrival — as 
I’m sure you’re aware. You’re to 
come along with me, Mr. Bravais. 
General Julius wants to interview 
you personally.” 

“When did the UN start hiring 
gun-punks?” 

He looked angry. “You can’t 
make me mad, Mr. Bravais.” 

“I could try,” I told him. I took 
a step toward him. “I could take 
that iron away for a start.” 



He stepped back. “Don’t do any- 
thing foolish! The gun fires real 
bullets.” 

“Not today it doesn’t. You don’t 
shoot anybody without orders from 
the boss, do you?” I advanced on 
him, giving him the kind of grin 
tri-D villains practice in front of a 
mirror. 

“I could make an exception.” His 
nostrils were white; I’d pushed him 
about as far as he’d go. 

“Oh, to Hell with it,” I said in 
a careless tone, relaxing. “How about 
a drink?” 

He hesitated. “All right, Mr. 
Bravais. You understand there’s 
nothing personal in this . .” 

“I guess you’ve got a job to do 
like the rest of us. You’re pretty 
good with that holding-the-breath 
bit.” I grinned happily, demonstrat- 
ing that I was the clever guy now, 
satisfied that I’d shown the op- 
position I was nobody’s dummy. “I 
planned to see the general this after- 
noon anyway.” I said. We had a 
short one and left together. 

B rigadier General Julius was a 
vigorous-looking, square-jawed, 
blond, crew-cut type, with an almost 
unbelievable smooth complexion 
which might have earned him the 
nickname Baby-face, if two fierce, 
coal-black eyes hadn’t dominated the 
composition. The gray UN uniform 
he wore had been tailored by an 
artist. The three rows of service 
ribbons on his chest indicated that, 
in spite of his youthful appearance, 
he had been at the scene of most 
of the shooting wars of the past 
twenty years. He was wearing the

old-fashioned Sam Browne belt and 
engineers’ boots that the UN High 
Command liked to affect, but the 
hand gun protruding from the hol- 
ster at his hip wasn’t a pearl-handl- 
ed six-shooter. It was the latest thing 
in pulse-energy weapons, stark and 
ugly, meant for murder, not show. 

“American Defense Department, 
eh?” He glanced at the copy of the 
perfectly legal orders Felix had man- 
aged for me, laid them to one side 
on the bare, highly polished desk 
top. He looked me over thought- 
fully. It was very quiet in the office. 
Far away, a voice spoke singsong 
Arabic. A fly buzzed at a window 

“I just arrived this afternoon, Gen- 
eral,” I offered. “I took a room at 
the King Feisal — ” 

“Room 4567,” Julius said sharply. 
“You were aboard BWA flight 87. 
I’m aware of your movements, Mr. 
Bravais. As UN Monitor General, 
1 make it my business to keep in- 
formed of everything that occurs 
within my command.” He had a 
flat, unpleasant voice, at variance 
with the wholesome, nationally-ad- 
vertised look of him. I nodded, look- 
ing impressed. I thought about the 
death penalty attached to the papers 
in my pocket, and was worried how 
much more he knew . 

“By golly, that’s remarkable. Gen- 
eral,” I said cheerfully. He nar- 
rowed his eyes at me. I had to be 
careful not to overdo the act, I re- 
minded myself. 

“Makes a man wonder how you 
can find time for your other du- 
ties,” I added, letting a small gleam 
of insolence temper the bland smile 
I was showing him. 



His eyes narrowed even further. 
I had the feeling that if he squeezed 
a little harder, they would pop out 
like watermelon seeds. 

“I manage, Mr. Bravais,” he said, 
holding his voice smooth. “Just how 
long can we expect your visit to 
last?” 

“Oh, 1 wouldn’t call it a visit, 
General,” I said breezily. “I’m here 
on PCS, an indefinite tour-. .” 
“In that case, I hope you find 
Tamboula to your liking.” His tone 
suggested that he thought it unlike- 
ly. “You’ve come at a fortunate 
time of the year. The racing is 
starting next week, and of course 
our grouse season is in full swing.” 
“I’ve heard a great deal about 
the ecological projects here,” I said. 
“Quite remarkable to see woodlands 
springing from the desert. But I’m 
afraid I’ll have very little time to 
devote to sports. My particular in- 
terest is close-support infantry tac- 
tics.” 

tCIV Xr. Bravais.” Julius raised a 
J- V. 1 hand. “The feeling seems 
to have gained wide currency in 
some quarters that conflicts such 
as the present one are spectacles 
carried out for the diversion of the 
curious. Such is far from the case. 
A political question is being resolved 
on the battle-field. UN control will, 
we trust, limit the scope of the 
hostilities. Undue attention by re- 
presentatives of major powers is 
not likely to assist in that effort. I 
suggest you consult the official his- 
tory — ” 

“I believe the principle of the 
right of observation has been too

well established to require any as- 
sertion by me — ” 1 started. 

“That is a matter quite outside my 
cognizance,” the general broke in. 
“My responsibility is to insure that 
the provisions of the Manhattan 
Convention are adhered to. Vou’ll 
understand that the presence of out- 
siders in the theatre unduly com- 
plicates that task.” He spoke with 
a curious, flat intensity, watching 
me with an unwinking gaze like a 
gunfighter waiting for the signal to 
go for his hip. 

“General, I’m an accredited offi 
cial observer; I hope you don’t in 
tend to deny me access to my sub- 
ject?” 

“Just what is it you wish to ob- 
serve?” he snapped. 

“Action at close range.” 

Julius shook his head. “That will 
not be possible tonight — ” he caught 
himself. 

I permitted myself the liberty of 
a grin. 

“Tonight, eh?” 

Julius leaned across his desk to- 
ward me. He was holding his tem- 
per pretty well, but a glint of red 
fire showed in his eyes now. 

“You will not approach closer 
than five miles to the line of ac- 
tion,” he said distinctly. “You will 
report to my adjutant daily at oh- 
eight-hundred hours and submit a 
schedule of your proposed move- 
ments. You will observe a nine 
o’clock curfew.” 

I got to my feet. “You’ve made 
a point of calling me ‘mister’; if 
your intelligence apparatus is as 
good as you say, you’re aware that 
I handle the rank of Brigadier. I 



haven’t asked for any courtesies, 
and I damned sure haven’t gotten 
any, but don’t bother planning my 
day for me — and don’t send out 
any more gun-handlers. I’ll be on 
my way now, General. Just consider 
this a courtesy call; I’ll operate on 
my own from now on.” 

He came around the desk, strode 
to the door, wrenched it open, 
turned to face me. 

“General Bravais, I cannot be 
responsible for your safety if you 
disregard my orders.” His voice had 
the grate of torn steel now. I had 
the impression General Julius was 
used to having his way. I wondered 
what he’d do if he got just a little 
madder . 

“You’re not responsible for me 
in any event, Julius,” I snapped. “I 
suggest you get back to your desk 
and cook up another chapter of 
that warmed-over, predigested, salt- 
free History of yours!” 

He was standing rigidly, holding 
the glass doorknob in a firm clutch. 
He stiffened as I spoke, then jerked 
his hand away from the doorknob; 
his lip was raised, showing a row 
of even white teeth. We stood, eyes 
locked. 

“I’m not accustomed to insolence 
in my own headquarters,” he grated, 
letting himself sound mad now. 

I glanced down at the doorknob. 
The clear glass was shot through 
with a pattern of fractured planes. 

“I guess you squeezed it too hard. 
General,” I said. He didn’t answer. 
I went on out along the narrow, 
gray-painted corridor and out into 
the hard, white, North African sun- 
shine.

I walked half a block at a pace 
just a trifle faster than the main 
flow, re-crossed the street, slowed 
and gave half a dozen grimy win- 
dews filled with moth-riddled mats 
and hammered brass atrocities more 
attention than they deserved. By the 
time I reached the end of the long 
block, I was sure: the little man 
with the formerly white suit and the 
pendulous lower lip was following 
me. 

I moved along, doing enough 
dodging around vegetable carts and 
portable Jimii shrines to make him 
earn his salary. He was a clumsy 
technician, and working alone. That 
meant that it was a routine shadow- 
ing job. Julius didn’t consider me to 
be of any special interest. 

At an intersection ahead a side- 
walk juggler had collected a cluster 
of spectators. I put on a burst, slid 
through the fringe of the crowd and 
around the corner. I stopped, count- 
ed to ten slowly, then plunged back 
the way I had come just in time to 
collide with my pursuer, coming up 
fast. We both yelped, staggered, 
groped for support, disengaged mut- 
tering excuses, and separated. 

I crossed the street, did an ele- 
mentary double-back through an ar- 
cade and watched him hurry past. 
Then I hailed a noisy cruising heli- 
cab that had probably been con- 
demned and sold by the City of New 
York Transit Authority a dozen 
years earlier. I caught a glimpse of 
him standing on the corner look- 
ing around worriedly as we lifted off 
over the rooftops. 



I didn’t waste any sympathy on 
him. He had been carrying a heavy 
solid-slug pistol under one arm. a 
light energy gun under the other, and 
at least three hypo-spray syringes un- 
der his left lapel, probably contain- 
ing assorted poisons to suit any per- 
sonality he might take dislike to. 

1 took out his wallet and riffled 
through it. There were a couple of 
hundred Algerian Francs, a new 
two cee American bill, a folded pa- 
per containing a white powder, a 
soiled card imprinted with the name 
of a firm specializing in unusual pho- 
tographs, one of the photographs, a 
week-old horoscope and a scrap of 
paper with my name scrawled on it. 

I didn’t know whether it was Juli- 
us’s handwriting or not, but there 
was enough of a UN watermark 
showing to make the question ac- 
ademic. 

The cab dropped me in the wide 
plaza in front of the down-at-heels 
aluminum and glass Army-Navy-Air 
Club. I gave the driver the little 
man’s two hundred francs. He ac- 
cepted it without comment: maybe 
New York had thrown him in on the 
deal with the heli. 

I had an hour or two to kill now. 
It would be necessary to stay away 
from my room long enough to give 
Julius — or anyone else with an in 
terest in my movements adequate 
time to look over the evidence 
planted there and satisfy himself as 
to my mission in Tamboula. Mean 
while, food was in order. 

I dodged the outstretched palm 
of a legless fellow mounted on an 
electric wheel board and pushed into 
the cool, pastel-tinted interior of the 



THE HOUNDS OF HELI 



17 




Club, where chattered conversations 
competed with the background throb 
of canned music. In the split-level 
dining room, I found a pleasant table 
by a sunny window. 

I had a surprisingly good lunch, 
lingered over a demi-bouteille of 
Chateau Lascombe ’19, and watched 
the officers of the opposing armies 
scheduled to lock themselves in mor- 
tal combat an hour after sundown. 
They shared tables, chatting and 
laughing over the brandy and cigars, 
the bright green of the Free Algerian 
uniform making a handsome contrast 
with the scarlet of the Imperial Mor- 
occans. It was either a civilized way 
to wage war, or a hell of an idiotic 
way for grown men to behave, I 
wasn’t sure which. 

I turned my attention from them 
and devoted the next hour to a 
careful study of Felix’s instructions. 

S unset was beginning to color the 
sky when I left the club and 
walked the four blocks to the King 
Feisal. 

Just opposite the marquee, a uni- 
formed chauffeur seemed to be hav- 
ing turbine trouble. He stood, peering 
under the raised hood with a worried 
expression. I went past him and a 
pair of shady businessmen types who 
started a vigorous conversation as I 
came up, and fell silent as I went 
through the door. Inside, a slight, 
colorless European in a tan suit lean- 
ing against the end of the lobby news 
kiosk gave me a once-over that was 
as subtle as a left hook. 

At the desk, the small, round, 
Frenchified Arab day manager rolled 
his eyes toward the far end of the 



counter. I eased along, made a show 
of looking through the free tour 
maps. He sidled over, perspiring hea- 
vily. 

“M’sieu — I have to tell you — a 
man was interrupted searching your 
room this afternoon.” His voice was 
a damp whisper, like something 
bubbling up through mud. His breath 
did nothing to lessen the similarity. 

“Sure,” I said, angling myself so 
that the nearest operative could 
catch it without straining. “But how 
about the Casbah?” 

The manager blinked, then got 
into the spirit of the thing. “I would 
have held him for the police, but he 
made a break for it.” 

“Say, that’s fine. I’ve always want- 
ed to see those dancing girls. Is it 
true about the raisin in their belly- 
button?” 

“That fellow — ” the manager’s 
eyes rolled toward a tall, thin man 
who was standing nearby leafing 
through a pictonews that looked as 
though his lunch had been wrapped 
in it — “he has been here all the af- 
ternoon.” His voice dropped to an 
even more confidential level. “I 
don’t like his looks.” 

I nodded. “You’re right,” I said 
loudly. “And he’s not even reading: 
his lips aren’t moving.” 

The newspaper jerked as though 
he’d just found his name in the obit- 
uary column. I went past him to the 
elevator, waited until the man in the 
tan suit had followed me in and got- 
ten settled: then I stepped back off. 
He hesitated for a moment, then 
showed me an expression like a man 
who has just remembered something, 
hurriedly got off. I promptly got

back oa, turned and gave him a nice 
smile which he failed to return as 
the doors closed. 

Riding up, I did a little rapid 
thinking. 

The clowns in the lobby were a 
trifle too good to be true. The man- 
ager’s little contribution was part of 
the performance, just in case I failed 
to spot them. Julius wanted to be 
sure I knew his eye was on me. 

I punched a button, got off a 
floor below my own, went along to 
the fire-stairs. I pushed through the 
glass door, went up past a landing lit- 
tered with used ampoules and the vi- 
olet-tinted butts of dope-sticks, came 
out in the shadows at the end of a 
poorly lighted corridor. 

My room was halfway along on 
the left. I went to it, put the micro- 
phone I wore disguised as a finger- 
ring against the door, placed my ear 
against the ring. I heard the clack of 
water dripping in the bathroom, the 
hollow hum of the ventilator, sounds 
from beyond the windows, nothing 
else. 

I keyed the door quietly and went 
in: the room was empty, silent, sad 
in the early evening light. The key to 
my briefcase lay where I had left it. 
I shone my U-V penlight on it and 
examined the words: the fluorescent 
film with which I had coated the 
web was scored. That meant that by 
now Julius was scanning copies of a 
number of carefully prepared letters 
and notes establishing my anti-UN, 
anti-Julius sentiment. It was a risky 
secondary cover to use with a man as 
sensitive of personal status as the 
general, but Felix had decided on 
it after a close study of his dossier. 



Give a man what he expects to find, 
and he’s satisfied. At least that was 
the theory. 

F or half an hour I puttered, put- 
ting away shirts, arranging pa- 
pers, mixing another drink. At the 
end of that time I had completed my 
inspection and was satisfied nothing 
new had been installed in the suite 
since I had seen it a few hours earli- 
er. The IR eye still peered at me 
from the center knob on the chest 
of drawers, and the pin head micro- 
phone in the plastic flower arrange- 
ment was still in place. I hung a 
soiled undershirt over the former. 
The audio pick-up didn’t bother me. 
I’d just make it a point to move 
quietly. 

It was almost dark now — time to 
be going. I made a few final noises 
in the bathroom with running water 
and clattering toilet articles; then I 
flipped off the lights, made the bed 
creak as I stretched out on it, then 
rose carefully, went to the closet, 
slid inside, and soundlessly shut the 
door. 

Following Felix’s written instruc- 
tions, I unscrewed the old-fashioned 
fluorescent tube from the ceiling fix- 
ture, pressed the switch concealed in 
the socket; the hatch in the end wall 
rolled smoothly back. I stepped 
through, closed it behind me, went 
along a narrow passage that ended in 
an iron ladder leading up. At the top 
I cracked my head in the dark, felt 
for the latch, lifted the panel and 
pulled myself up into the stifling 
heat of the dark, cramped room 
Severance had fitted out as my for- 
ward command post. It wasn’t much 



THE HOUNDS OF HEIL

to look at — a seven by twelve foot 
space, low-ceilinged, blank walled, 
with a grimy double hung window at 
one end giving a view of irregular 
black roof tops and, far away, tall 
palms like giant dandelions against a 
sky of luminous deep blue that was 
growing deeper. 

I closed the shutter's and switched 
on the ceiling light, the sudden 
brightness hurting my eyes. 

A steel locker against the wall op- 
ened to the combination Severance 
had given me. If I had made an er- 
ror, a magnesium flare would have 
reduced the contents to white-hot 
ash. I pulled the door wide, took out 
a limp, fish-scale textured coverall 
with heavy fittings moulded into the 
fabric at the small of the back and at 
the ankles. I pulled off my jacket, 
struggled into the garment: it was 
called an optical-effect suit, and it 
was one of the CBI’s best-kept sec- 
rets. It had the unusual property of 
absorbing some wavelengths of light 
and re-emitting them in the infra- 
red, reflecting others in controlled 
patterns. It was auto-tuned over the 
entire visible spectrum, and was cap- 
able of duplicating any background 
pattern short of a clan Ginsberg tar- 
tan. I couldn’t walk down a crowded 
avenue in it without causing a few 
puzzled stares, but in any less crow- 
ded setting, it was as close an approx- 
imation of a cloak of invisibility as 
science had come up with. It was 
the cover Lab’s newest toy, and was 
worth a hundred thousand cees in 
small, unmarked bills in any of the 
secret market-places of the world. 
Felix had gone all the way in steal- 
ing it for me. 



T he second item I would need 
for the evening’s adventure was 
a compact apparatus the size and 
shape of an old-style cavalry canteen, 
fitted with high-velocity gas jets and 
heavy clips which locked to matching 
fittings on the suit. I lifted it — it was 
surprisingly heavy — and clamped it 
in place against my chest. Broad 
woven wire straps stitched into the 
suit took up the weight. I tried the 
control — a two-inch knob at the cen- 
ter of the unit. 

Immediately I felt the slightly 
nauseous sensation of free-fall. The 
surface of the suit cracked softly as 
static charges built and neutralized 
themselves against the field-interface. 
Then my toes were reaching for the 
floor. My focussed-phase field grav- 
ity settled over me again like a lead 
cape. I checked the deep thigh poc- 
kets of the suit; there was a pair of 
three-ounce, hundred-power binocu- 
lar-goggles, a spring-steel sheath 
knife, a command-monitor commun- 
icator tuneable to the frequencies 
of both combatants as well as to the 
special band available only to Felix. 
I pressed the send-button, got no 
reply. Felix was out. 

In a buttoned-down pocket, I 
found a 2 mm needier, smaller and 
lighter than the standard Navy mo- 
del I normally carried. Its darts were 
charged with a newly developed, 
wide-spectrum venom guaranteed to 
kill a charging elephant within a mic- 
rosecond of contact. I tucked it back 
in its fitted holster with the same re- 
spect a snake-handler gives a krait. 

I was hot in the suit. Sweat was al- 
ready beginning to trickle down my 
back. I switched off the lights, open-

ed the shutters and the window, craw- 
led through and found a precarious 
foothold on a ledge. 

The air was cooler here. I took a 
couple of deep breaths to steady my 
nerves, carefully not looking down 
the sheer five-hundred-foot face of 
the building. 1 groped the commun- 
icator from my pocket, made an- 
other try to raise Felix: still nothing. 
I would have to move without the 
reassurance of knowing that some- 
one was available to record my last 
words. 

I twisted the lift control. 

At once the close, airless pressure 
of the field shut away the faint bre- 
eze. Tiny blue sparks arced to the 
wall at my back. I was lifting now, 
feeling the secure pressure against my 
feet drifting away. I pushed clear, 
twisting myself to a semi-horizontal 
chest-down position, and waved my 
arms, striving for equilibrium, fight- 
ing against the feeling that in another 
instant I would plummet to the pave- 
ment. It was a long way down, and 
although my intellect told me my fly- 
ing carpet would support up to a half 
ton of dead weight, my emotions told 
me I was a foolish and extremely fra- 
gile man, a long way from his native 
element. 

I touched the jet control lever, 
and at the forward surge, my verti- 
go left me. Suddenly I was a swift, 
soundless bird, sweeping through the 
wide night sky on mighty pinions — 

A dark shape loomed in front of 
me. 

I gave the fieldstrength knob a 
convulsive twist, cleared an unlighted 
roof antenna by a foot. From now 
on. I fold myself, it would be a good 



idea to do my pinion-sweeping with 
a little more caution. I slowed my 
forward motion and angled steeply 
up. 

The lights were dwindling away be- 
low now, the glitter of /’ Avenue des- 
N at ions the hard shine from the win- 
dows of hotels and office buildings. 
The sounds that floated up to me 
were dull, muted by the field. At an 
estimated five hundred feet altitude, 
I took a bearing on the blue beacon 
atop the control tower at Hammar- 
skold Field, a mile east of the town, 
opened my jets to full bore and 
headed for the battlefield. 

IV 

I hung three hundred feet above 
the sparsely wooded hill top 
where the blue-clad Moroccans had 
set up their forward field HQ, jig- 
gling my position controls to coun- 
ter brisk breeze and mentally calcu- 
lating the odds against my being bag- 
ged by a wild shot. With my goggles 
tuned to low mag and IR filter, I 
was able to make out a cluster of 
officers around a chart table, three 
recon cars, parked behind the crest 
of the hill with their drivers beside 
them, and a line of dug-in riflemen 
on the forward slope. Five miles to 
the north, the pale blue flashes of 
the Algerians’ opening bombardment 
winked against the horizon. 

The battle’s objective was a bomb- 
ed-out oasis occupying the center of 
the shallow valley ringed by the low 
hills over one of which I now hov- 
ered. 

According to Felix’s Utter Top Se- 
cret battle plan, the Algerians would 



THE HOUNDS OF HELL 



21 




thrust their right forward in a feint 
to the Moroccan left, while quickly 
bringing up the bulk of their light 
armor behind the screen of the hills 
on the enemy right. The Moroccan 
strategy was to sit tight in defensive 
entrenchments until the enemy in- 
tention became clear. Then they 
would launch a drive straight down 
the valley, with a second column 
poised to take the Algerians in the 
flank as soon as they struck from 
cover at the Moroccan flank. It 
seemed like a nice, conventional ex- 
ercise, and I felt sure the boys would 
enjoy it a lot. 

The Algerian ballistic shells were 
making vivid puffs high above the 
thumps of sound as the Moroccan 
anti-ballistic artillery made their in- 
terceptions. At each flash the details 
of the battlefield below blinked into 
momentary clarity. It was an almost 
steady flickering, like heat lightning 
on a summer evening. 

I turned up my binocular magni- 
fication, scanned the distant Alger- 
ian massing area for signs of their 
main column moving out. They were 
a minute or two ahead of schedule. 
The churn of dust was just beginning 
to rise above the lead element: then 
anti- dust equipment went into opera- 
tion and the cloud dissipated. Now I 
could pick out the tiny pinpricks of 
running lights, coming swiftly around 
in the shelter of the distant hills to 
form the arrowhead of the Algerian 
attack. 

I lifted myself another hundred 
feet, jetted toward their route of 
advance. They were coming up fast, 
risking accidents in the dark to beat 



the best time the Moroccans would 
have estimated was possible. I arrived 
over the cut through which they 
would turn to make their dash for 
the oasis just as the lead tank roun- 
ded into it, a massive Bolo Mark II, 
running without lights. The Mor- 
occans, caught in the trap of over- 
confidence in their intelligence 
analysis, still showed no signs of rec- 
ognizing the danger. The first squad 
of four Algerian combat units was 
through the pass now, gunning out 
into the open. The bombardment 
went on, building to a climax, lulling 
the Moroccans into keeping their 
heads down, secure in the assump- 
tion that the enemy would hold his 
armor well back from the rain of 
devastation showering down from 
above. 

Belatedly now, a volley of flares 
went up from the Moroccan side: 
the tanks had been spotted. 

Abruptly the valley burned dead 
white under a glare like six small 
suns. Each racing tank was the base 
of a cluster of long, bounding sha- 
dows of absolute black. I dropped 
lower, watched the second and third 
elements follow the lead units 
through the pass. The fourth unit of 
the last squad, lagging far behind, 
slowed and came to a stop. A minute 
passed. Then he started up and 
moved slowly ahead by passing the 
designated route of march. 

Out on the plain, Moroccan tanks 
were roaring out from their positions 
two miles to my left, guns stabbing 
across the plain, both columns to- 
gether in a hammer-blow at the Al- 
gerian surprise thrust. Below me, the 
tank trundled heavily away from the

IF 




scene of action, veering to the left 
now, moving into broken ground. 

The approved Battle Plan had in- 
cluded no detachment operating in- 
dependently on the Algerian left. If 
the wandering Bolo were detected by 
the monitors ■ — as it must inevitably 
be within minutes — the battle was 
forfeit, the fury and destruction all 
for nothing. Something was up . 

I ignored the battle shaping up on 
the plain, dropped to a hundred 
feet, followed the tank as it lum- 
bered down a shale-littered slope in- 
to deep shadow. 

1 moved carefully between tow- 
ering walls of shattered rock, 
fifty feet above the floor of the dry 
wadi along which the Bolo moved 
in a sluggish crawl, a finger of light 
from its turret probing uncertainly 
ahead as though exploring new and 
dangerous territory. It negotiated an 
awkward turn, halted. I saw a faint 
gleam as its hatch cycled: then a sil- 
houetted man clambered out, drop- 
ped to the ground: the tank sat with 
turbines idling, its searchlight fixed 
aimlessly on a patch of bare rock, 
like the gaze of a dead man. I 
turned up the sensitivity of my gog- 
gles, tried to penetrate the darkness. 
I couldn’t see the driver. I moved 
closer. 

Something massive and dark was 
coming up the ravine toward me, 
hovering about two yards above the 
ground. 

It was a flattish shape, roughly 
oval, dull-colored, casting a faint 
blue-green glow against the rocky 
walls as it maneuvered gently around 
a projecting buttress, settled in close 



to the Bolo. For a moment nothing 
happened. The idling engine of the 
tank was a soft growl against utter 
stillness, punctuated by the sounds of 
distant battle. 

Then there was a heavy thud. The 
sound reminded me of a steer I had 
seen poleaxed once in a marketplace 
in Havana. 

I worked my binocular controls, 
tuning well over into the IR. The 
scene before me took on a faint, 
eerie glow. I maneuvered to the 
right, made out an oblong patch of 
lesser blackness against the dark 
ground. 

Abruptly shadows were sliding up 
the rock wall. The angry snarl of an 
engine sounded from behind me. 

I lifted myself quickly, moved 
back against the ravine face. The ar- 
mored shape of a late model com- 
mand car careened into view, an 
opaque caterpillar of dust boiling up 
behind it, the blue-white lance of its 
canyon floor, picking up the dusty 
flank of the squatting giant, reflect- 
ing from the polished rim of its open 
hatch. The car slowed and stopped 
directly below me, hovering on its 
air-cushion, the blue-black muzzles 
of its twin infinite repeaters poking 
through the armorglass canopy, cen- 
tered on the tank. 

A minute passed. Faint, flickering 
light stuttered against the sky in the 
direction of the battle. The car below 
sank and came to rest slightly can- 
ted on the boulder-strewn ground. 
Its engines died. Metal clanked as 
its door slid open. 

A man in the dull green of the Al- 
gerian field uniform stepped out, a 
pistol in his hand. He shouted in 



THE HOUNDS OF HELL 



23 




Arabic. There was no reply. He 
walked forward into the settling dust 
in the alley of light from the car’s 
headlamp, his shadow stalking 
ahead. I saw the glint of the palm- 
leaf insignia on his shoulder. A 
major, probably the squadron com- 
mander. 

He stopped, seemed to totter for a 
moment, then fell stiffly forward, hit 
hard on his face, lay without moving. 

I hung where I was, absolutely 
still, waiting. 

From the darkness between the 
stalled tanks, a creature came into 
view, padding silently on broad, dead 
white paws like ghastly caricatures of 
human hands. Stiff, coarse hair bris- 
tled on the lean, six-foot body, grow- 
ing low on the forehead of a naked 
face like a fanged and snouted skull. 
A pattern of straps crisscrossed the 
razor back. Light winked from metal 
fittings on the harness. 

It came up to the man who lay 
face down with his feet toward me, 
fifty feet below, settled itself on its 
haunches, fumbled with its obscenely 
human hands in a pouch at its side. 
1 caught a glint of light from pol- 
ished instruments: then it crouched 
over the man, set to work. 

1 heard a grating sound, realized 
that 1 had been grinding my teeth 
together in a rictus to shock. Cold 
sweat trickled down the side of my 
neck under the suit. 

Down below, the creature worked 
busily, its gaunt, narrow-shouldered 
body screening its task. It shifted 
position, presenting its back now, the 
long curve of its horselike neck. 

I had to force my hand to move. 
1 slipped the dart gun from its fitted 



pocket, flipped off the safety. The 
beast labored on, absorbed in its vic- 
tim: quick motions of its elbows re- 
flected its deft manipulations. A 
feeling of nightmarish unreality 
seemed to hang over the scene: the 
wink and rumble of artillery beyond 
the hills, the knifelike sharpness of 
the shadows thrown by the light of 
the command car, the patient whine 
of the idling engine, the intent, de- 
monic figure. I took careful aim 
just below a triangular clasp secur- 
ing two straps that crossed the 
arched back, and fired. 

T he creature twitched a patch of 
hide impatiently, went on with 
its work. I aimed again, then lowered 
the gun without firing a second time. 
If one jolt of Felix’s wide-spectrum 
venom had no effect, two wouldn’t 
help. 

I flattened myself in the pocket of 
shadow against the cliff -face, watch- 
ed as the alien rose to a grotesque 
two-legged stance, pranced away on 
its rear hands toward the body of a 
driver, lying crumpled by the nearest 
Bolo. The major lay on his back 
now: his cap nearby, his gun a yard 
beyond it. There was blood on his 
face and on the dusty stone under 
him. I estimated the distance to the 
command car, gauging the possibil- 
ity of reaching it and training the 
forward battery on the monstrosity 
was now leaning over the second 
man. 

There was a sudden, sharp yelp. 
The alien darted a few steps, col- 
lided glancingly with the massive 
skirt of the Bolo, veered toward me.

IF 




I caught a glimpse of a gaping 
mouth, a ragged, black tongue, teeth 
like needles of yellow bone. The 
stricken demon bit at its rear quar- 
ters, running a tight circle like a 
dog chasing its tail, yelping sharply: 
then it was down, kicking, scrabbling 
with its pale, flat hands, raising a 
roil of dust. Then it stiffened and 
lay still. 

I dropped quickly to the ground 
and switched off the lift-field. I 
caught the reek of exhaust fumes, 
the hot-stone odor of the desert, a 
sharp, sour smell that I knew eman- 
ated from the dead creature. Sounds 
were louder now: the distant firing 
took on a sharp and immediate qual- 
ity. The keening turbine was like a 
wail of abandoned hope. 

I went to the body of the major, 
bent over it. The face was slack, the 
eyelids unnaturally sunken. There 
was a clean wound across the fore- 
head at the hairline: the hair was 
matted with glistening blood. 1 
turned him on his face and felt the 
blood drain from my own. 

The top of his skull had been cut 
free. It hung in place on a hinge of 
scalp. Inside the glistening red-black 
cavity was nothing. 

I leaned closer. A deep incision 
gaped from the base of the skull 
down under the collar. Very little 
blood had leaked from it: the heart 
had stopped before the wound was 
made. 

The alien lay fifteen feet away. 1 
looked across at it, my breathing 
coming fast and shallow now, hissing 
between teeth that were bared in a 
snarl. Every instinct I owned was 
telling me to put space between my- 



self and the demonic creature that 
had walked like a beast but had used 
its hands like a man. I heard of 
hackles rising: now I felt them. I 
gripped the gun tighter as I crossed 
the last few feet, stood lookng down 
at the sparse, rumpled coat through 
which dull gray-pink skin showed. I 
prodded the body with a boot: it 
was stiff, inert, abnormally heavy. 
I pushed harder, rolled it over. At 
close range, the face was yellowish 
white, dry, porous-textured. The 
hands were outflung, palms up, 
bloody from the trepanning of the 
major: near one lay a bulging, gal- 
lon-sized sack, opaque with dust. I 
stepped around to it, knelt and 
wiped a finger across the bulge on 
the surface. 

It was yielding and warm to the 
touch. Pinkish fluid wobbled under 
the taut membrane. I brushed away 
more dust. Now I could see a pink, 
jellylike mass suspended in the liquid. 
It had a furrowed surface, like sun- 
baked mud, and from its underside a 
thick, curled stem hung down, neatly 
snipped off at the three-inch mark. 
I prodded the bag: the mass stirred: 
a snow-white sphere just smaller than 
a golf ball wavered into view, turn- 
ing to show me a ring of amber 
brown with a black center dot. 

The beast had been a skilled sur- 
geon. In just under five minutes it 
had removed the major’s brain, com- 
plete with eyeballs. 

V 

T he battle sounds were slacken- 
ing now. It wouldn’t be long be- 
fore another vehicle came along the

IF 




ravine in search of the missing Bolo 
and the officer who had followed it. 
I stood, feeling my heart pound as 
though I had run a mile, fighting 
down the sickish feeling that knotted 
my stomach. I didn’t have much 
time and there were things to be 
done— now. I could have a nervous 
collapse later — after I had played 
this nightmare scene out to its end. 

The tankman, lying awkwardly 
beside his machine, was dead, al- 
ready cooling to the touch. I went 
back to the fallen demon, went 
through the pouches attached to the 
creature’s harness, found a case fit- 
ted with scalpels, forceps, a tiny 
saber saw. There was a supply of 
plastic containers and a miniature 
apparatus with attached tubing — 
probably a pump-and-filter combina- 
tion for drawing off plasma. There 
was another container, packed with 
ampoules of a design I had seen re- 
cently — on the landing in my 
hotel. 

The thought was like a cold fin- 
ger on my spine. 

The last pouch yielded a scrap of 
smooth, tough paper, imprinted with 
lines of pot-hooks of a sort I had 
never seen before. I tucked it away 
in my knee-pocket, got to my feet. 
The paper was better than nothing 
as evidence that I hadn’t been the 
dreamer of a particularly horrible 
nightmare. But I needed something 
that would communicate some of the 
shock that had turned my heart to 
ice. Felix need to see that skull- 
white face . 

The ravine was still quiet: maybe 
I had time. 

I ran to the car, started it up, 



brought it forward, halted it be- 
side the dead man. I jumped down 
lifted the limp, still warm body into 
the cockpit. I remounted, maneu- 
vered up beside the dead alien. I 
opened the cargo compartment at 
the rear of the car, then gritted my 
teeth and grasped the creature’s hind 
wrists. Through the gloved hands of 
the suit, the bristles were as stiff as 
scrub-brushes. I dragged the corpse 
to the car, used the power of the 
suit to lift the three-hundred-pound 
weight, tumbled it inside. 

I went back for the sack contain- 
ing the brain, put it on the seat be- 
side the dead major, then climbed 
in and headed back up the ravine. 

As I reached the first turn, a 
glare of light projected the car’s 
moving shadow on the rock wall 
ahead. I turned, saw a brilliant flare 
fountain from the open hatch of the 
Bolo. 

I gunned the car, felt a tremor 
run through the rock an instant be- 
fore I heard the blast. Small stones 
rained down, bounded off the cano- 
py and hood. Either the tank had 
been mined for automatic destruc- 
tion if abandoned, or the creature 
I had killed had set a time-charge 
to eliminate the traces of his clan- 
destine visit. I tramped on the throt 
tie, holding my thoughts rigidly on 
my driving. I wasn’t ready yet to 
think about the implications of what 
I had seen. I could feel the full shock 
of it, lurking in the wings, waiting to 
jump out and send me screaming for 
a policeman — but that would have 
to wait. Now, like a thief fleeing a 
broached vault with an unexpectedly 
rich haul, I was concerned only with 



THE HOUNOS OF HELL

getting clear with my prize while 
there was still time. 

Because there was no doubt that 
in a little while — when whoever, or 
whatever was awaiting the return of 
the brain-thief realized that some- 
thing was awry — a variety of hell 
would break loose that would make 
ordinary death and destruction seem 
by comparison as mild and whole- 
some as a Spring formal. 

I skirted the hills where flood' 
lights were glaring now in the Mor- 
occan camp: the cease-fire had 

apparently been sounded: UN moni- 
tors would be moving out on the 
field, tallying casualties, looking for 
evidence of illegal weapons, checking 
out complaints by both sides of Bat- 
tle Plan violations. I hoped that in 
the general excitement the absence 
of the command car would go un- 
noticed for now. The road into Tam- 
boula was a wide, well-patrolled 
highway: I avoided it, took a route 
across a wasteland of stunted mes- 
quite, skirted a trenched and irriga- 
ted field, orderly in the light of the 
new-risen moon, stopped by a clump 
of trees fifty yards from Felix’s villa, 
a former farmhouse, converted by 
the CBI into an armored fortress 
capable of withstanding a siege that 
would have leveled Stalingrad. The 
windows were dark. I took out my 
communicator, pressed the red but- 
ton which turned it to Felix’s spe- 
cial equipment. 

“Wolfhound here, Talisman. Any- 
body home?” 

There was no reply. I tried again: 
nothing. It was too early to start 
worrying, but I started anyway. 

There were sounds on the road 



behind me now. The troops — those 
who had survived — tired and happy 
after their evening’s fun, were start- 
ing back to their billets in town. 
Even if my borrowed car hadn’t been 
missed yet, the sight of it would in- 
spire laggard memories. I couldn’t 
stay here. 

General Julius had been less than 
enthusiastic about my presence in 
Tamboula: my arrival at his head- 
quarters in a stolen Algerian com- 
mand car would hardly be calculated 
to soothe his irritation. But even a 
stuffed shirt of a political appointee 
would have a difficult time shrug- 
ging off what I had to show him. 
And I had to share the knowledge 
of my cargo with someone — now. I 
gunned the car around the side of 
the house, out across a field of cab- 
bages, mounted the raised highway 
and barreled for the city at flank 
speed. 

1 parked the car beside a gleam- 
ing Monojag in the well-lighted 
but deserted ten-car garage under 
UN headquarters, pulled off the suit 
and harness, took the lift to the 
third floor, walked through deserted 
offices to General Julius’ door, went 
in without knocking. He was there, 
sitting at his desk, square-shouldered 
and grim-jawed, like a cornered po- 
lice chief promising the press an ar- 
rest at any moment. He didn’t move 
as I came up to his desk. 

“I’m glad I caught you. General,” 
I said. “Something’s happened that 
you should know about.” 

He was a long time reacting to 
my presence — as though he were 
wool-gathering a long way off. His

eyes seemed to focus on me slowly. 
His mouth opened, then closed hard. 

“Yes?” he snapped. “What do you 
want?” 

“Have you had a report of a mis- 
sing Bolo and a command car?” 
His dead-black eyes narrowed. I 
had his attention now. The room 
seemed very still: there was tension 
in the air, as though many ears were 
listening for what I might say next. 
“Missing combat units?” Julius said 
expressionlessly. “Go on.” 

“An Algerian Mark II wandered 
off the beaten path. It wound up in 
a ravine about three miles south of 
the action.” 

Julius stared at me. “You ob- 
served this?” His fingers squeaked 
on the desk top. 

“That’s right. The car followed the 
Bolo in. A major was driving it.” 
“You imply that this vehicle ma- 
neuvered in violation of the Battle 
Plan?” His tone was smooth now — 
like the edge of an axe. 

“They left the field of action and 
went south. Let’s not play footsie 
about the Battle Plan. Sure I had a 
copy. Grow up, General. I’m not a 
reporter for a family magazine. I’m 
here on business. Part of my busi- 
ness is to know what’s going on.” 
“My order to you — ” 

“Don’t ride a busted bluff down 
in flames, General. How about that 
Bolo?” 

Julius leaned forward. “A ravine, 
south of the battle ground?” 
“That’s right. There’s not much 
left of it. It blew.” 

“How close were you?” 

“Close enough.” 

“And the car?” 



“It’s downstairs, in your garage.” 
I let that one ride. Julius cocked 
his head, as though listening to ad- 
vice from unhear voices. 

“Where did you find the vehicle?” 
“Where the driver left it.” 

“And you took it?” 

“Look, General, I didn’t come 
here to talk about traffic violations. 
I saw something out there — -” 

“You dared to defy me?” Julius’ 
classically chiseled upper lip was 
writhing back in a snarl: behind his 
eyes red fires burned. It seemed to 
be taking all his will power not to 
bite me. “You entered the battle 
zone — ” 

“Forget that!” I cut him off. 
“There’s some kind of vehicle sit- 
ting out there near what’s left of the 
Bolo. The blast probably caught it, 
but there should be enough left to 
work on. I saw what got out of it. 
It wasn’t human. It killed the driver 
and the major.” I stopped then, be- 
latedly. What I was saying sounded 
wild, even to me. “Come with me, 
General,” I said. “I’ll show you.” 
Abruptly, he laughed — a harsh, 
tinny sound. 

“I see. It’s a joke,” he stated. He 
got to his feet. “Just one moment. I 
have an important call to make.” I 
stared after him as he strode across 
the room, disappeared into an inner 
room. 

There was a call-screen beside his 
desk. I went to it, cautiously eased 
the conference switch to the ‘on’ po- 
sition. There was a soft hum, noth- 
ing more. A pad lay on top of the 
cabinet, marks scribbled on it. I half 
turned away — 

I stood looking down at the paper. 



THE HOUNDS OF HELL 



29 




my heart starting to thump again un- 
der my ribs like a caged bird. The 
lines on the paper were not mere 
random jottings. They were letters, 
words: words in an alien script. 

I had seen similar pot hooks less 
than an hour before — on the paper 
I had taken from the pocket of the 
demon. 

A t that moment Julius strode back 
into the room, his face fixed 
in a smile as authentic as the 
gold medals on a bottle of vermouth. 

“Now, General Bravais,” he said 
in a tone of forced geniality, “why 
don’t you and I sit down and have a 
quiet drink together?” 

I shook my head. It was time for 
me to stop talking and start think- 
ing — something I hadn’t done 
much of since the four-handed hor- 
ror had stalked out of the shadows 
and into my world-picture. I had 
come here, babbling out my story, 
wanting someone to share the shat- 
tering thing I had seen. But my 
choice of confidants had been as 
poor as the judgment I had been 
showing ever since I had left the 
ravine. I had channeled my panic 
into the outward semblance of sober, 
reasonable action — but it had been 
panic nonetheless. 

Julius had his office booze cab- 
inet open now. Shelves with ice- 
buckets, tongs, bottles, glasses de- 
ployed themselves at the touch of a 
button. 

“What about a Scotch, General?” 
He suggested. “Bourbon? Soy?” 

“I’d better be on my way, Gener- 
al,” I said. I moved toward the 
door, “Perhaps I got a little too 



excited. Maybe I was seeing things.” 
My hand was feeling for the dart 
gun — until I realized, with a pang of 
unpleasant excitement, that I had 
left it in the car with the lift-suit. 

“Of course! You’re probably fam- 
ished. I’ll just order up a bite. 1 
haven’t eaten myself.” 

“No, thanks, General. I’m pretty 
tired. I’ll check in at my hotel 
and . .” My voice trailed off fool- 
ishly. I — and Felix — had gone to 
considerable trouble to leave the 
public with the impression that I 
was tucked safely away in my room. 
Now I was here, putting Julius on 
notice that while his watchdogs 
curled happily on my doorstep, I 
had been out on the town — and 
the super-secret equipment Felix had 
lent me was lying unattended in the 
car. 

“I have quarters right here in the 
building, General Bravais,” Julius 
bored on. “No need to go back to 
your rooms. Just make yourself com- 
fortable here.” 

I held up a hand and fixed a silly 
smile in place. It came naturally. I 
felt as phony as a man who reaches 
for his wallet after a big dinner and 
feels nothing but his hipbone. 

“I have a couple of appointments 
this evening,” I gushed, “and some 
papers I want to go over. And I 
need to get my notes in shape.” I 
had the door open now. “What 
about first thing in the morning?” 

Julius was coming toward me, 
with an expression on his face that 
human features had never been 
shaped for. A good soldier knows 
when he’s up against something too 
big to handle — when it’s time to run.

I slammed the door on the square 
tight-lipped face, sprinted for the 
lift, then bypassed it, plunged for 
the stairs. 

Behind me there was a heavy 
crash and the pound of feet. I 
skidded through the scattered butts 
on the landing, leaped down five 
steps at a time. I could hear Julius 
above, not getting any closer, but 
not losing any ground either. As I 
ran, I tried to picture the layout of 
the garage. The lift door had been 
in the center of the wall, with an- 
other door to its left. The car was 
parked fifteen feet from it. It would 
be to my left as I emerged. 

I needed more time. There was a 
trick for getting down stairs quickly 
— if my ankles could take it. 

I whirled around the second land- 
ing, half-turned to the left, braced 
my feet, the left higher than the 
right, and jumped. My feet struck 
at an angle, skidded: I shot down as 
though I were on a ski slope, 
slammed the next landing, took a 
quick step, leaped again. 

The door to the garage was in 
front of me now. I wrenched it open, 
skidded through, slammed it. There 
was a heavy thumb latch. I flipped 
it, heard the solid snick as it seated. 

I dashed for the car, leaped the 
side. 

A thunderous blow struck the 
heavy metal-clad fire door behind 
me. 

I scrambled into the seat, kicked 
the starter, saw dust whirl from be- 
neath the car. There was a second 
clangorous shock against the ar- 
mored door. I twisted, saw it jump 
— then, unbelievingly, bulge — 



The metal tore with a screech. 
A hand groped through the jagged 
opening, found the latch, plucked it 
from the door as though it were 
made of wet paper. 

The car was up on its air cushion 
now; I backed it as the door swung 
wide. Julius came through, ran 
straight for me. 

I wrenched the wheel over, gunned 
the twin turbines; the car leaped 
forward, caught Julius square across 
the chest with a shock as though I 
had hit a hundred-year oak, carried 
him backward. I saw furrows ap- 
pear in the chromalloy hood as his 
fingers clawed — 

Then the car thundered against 
the masonry wall and rebounded in 
a rain of falling bricks. 

Through the dust, I saw Julius’s 
arm come up, strike down at the 
crumpled metal before him with a 
shock that I felt through the frame. 
There was a howl of metal in 
agony — then a deafening rattle as 
the turbines chattered to a halt. 
The car dropped with a bone-bend- 
ing jar. I stumbled out, half-dazed, 
stood staring at General Julius’ dust- 
covered head and shoulders pinned 
between the ruined car and the wall, 
one arm outflung, the other plunged 
through metal into the heart of the 
engine. 

I became aware of voices. I 
turned and saw a huddle of lo- 
cals, one or two pale, wide-eyed 
European faces at the open garage 
doors. 

Like a man in a daze I walked 
around the rear of the wrecked car, 
pulled open the door of the Monojag 



THE HOUNDS OF HELL

parked beside it, transferred the suit 
and life-harness to the other car. I 
took the sheath knife from the suit 
pocket, went to the cargo compart- 
ment of the Turbocad, threw open 
the lid. A wave of an unbelievable 
stench come from the body of the 
dead thing inside. I gritted my teeth, 
sawed at the skin of the long, lean 
neck. It was like hacking at an oak 
root. I saw a pointed ear, almost 
grasped it, worked at it with the 
keen blade. Brownish fluid seeped 
out as I worried through it. Behind 
me, the curious spectators were 
shouting questions back and forth 
now. With a savage slash, I freed 
the ear, jammed it in a pocket, then 
whirled to the Monojag, jumped in, 
started up. I backed, wheeled out, 
and away down the street. 

In the mirror, I saw the crowd 
start cautiously forward. 

Driving aimlessly along dark 
streets, I tried again and failed again 
to raise Felix on my communicator. 
I switched on the radio, caught a 
throaty male contralto muttering a 
song of strange perversions. On an- 
other channel, wild brass instruments 
squealed a hybrid syncopated alhaza. 
On a third a voice gushing with 
synthetic excitement reported the 
latest evidence of an imminent cold- 
war thaw in the form of a remark 
made at a reception by the wife of 
an Albanian diplomat in the hearing 
of the Chinese Charge to the effect 
that only French wine would be 
served at a coming dinner in honor 
of the birthday of the Cuban Presi- 
dent. 

The next item was about a mad- 
man who had murdered an Algerian 



officer. The victim’s headless body 
had been found in a stolen military 
vehicle which had been wrecked and 
abandoned near UN headquarters. 

1 looked at my watch, lulius’s 
heirs were fast workers. It had 
been exactly sixteen minutes since I 
had left his body pinned under the 
wreckage of the command car. 

VI 

1 parked the Turbocad three 
blocks from the King Feisal, 
took five minutes to don the OE 
suit, complete with lift-harness, then 
drove slowly along toward the hotel. 
The news bulletin had said nothing 
about the car I was now in; it 
had also failed to mention the dead 
general, the body of the alien or 
the bagged brain. It wasn’t mere 
sloppy reporting. The version of the 
story that was being released had 
been concocted hurriedly, but care- 
fully. I could expect that other 
measures would have been taken, 
with equal care. It was not time for 
me to allow myself the luxury of 
errors in strategy — but there were 
things I needed in my secret hide- 
away. 

The hotel was just ahead now. 
I slowly edged toward the curb. 

To an observer, the car would ap- 
pear to be empty, a remoted pickup 
of the type assigned to VIP’s who 
objected to sharing transportation 
with anything as unreliable as a hu- 
man driver. A doorman in an ornate 
Zouave uniform came forward, 
glanced in the car as it came to a 
stop; he looked around sharply, 
turned and took three steps to a

call-screen, talked tersely into it. 
Moments later, two hard-eyed men 
in unornamented dark coveralls 
strode from the hotel entry, fanned 
out to approach the car from two 
sides. 

I had seen enough to get the gen- 
eral idea. 

i nudged the car into motion, 
steering between the two wide-shoul- 
dered, lean-hipped trouble boys. One 
whipped out a three-inch black disk 
— a police control-override. A red 
light blinked on the dash. The car 
faltered as the external command 
came to brake. 

I gunned it hard, felt the ac- 
celerator jam. The nearer man was 
swinging alongside now, reaching for 
the door. An unfamiliar lever caught 
my eye, mounted to the left of the 
cruise control knob; I hit it, felt the 
accelerator go to the floor. There 
was a sharp tug, a rending of metal, 
and the car leaped ahead. In the 
mirror I saw one of the two men 
down, skidding to the curb. The 
other stood, feet apart, bringing a 
hand gun to bear — 

I cut the wheel and howled into a 
cross street as solid slugs sang off 
the armored bubble next to my ear. 
Ahead, a startled man in a white 
turban leaped from my path. Late 
drinkers at a lone lighted sidewalk 
cafe stared as I shot past. I got 
the needier out, put it on the seat 
beside me. I half-expected to see a 
roadblock pop up ahead. If it did, 
I would hit it wide-open. 

I had no intention of stopping 
until I had put a healthy distance 
between myself and the man I had 
seen in the mirror, scrambling to his 



feet, still holding in his hand the door 
handle he had torn from the car. 

I parked the all-too-identifiable 
car a block farther along, oh a 
dark side street; I palmed the gun, 
slid out, stood in the darkness under 
a royal palm with a trunk like gray 
cement, giving my instincts a chance 
to softly whisper warnings in my 
ears. 

It was very still here. Far away, 
I heard a worn turbine coming clos- 
er, then going away. The moon was 
up now, an icy blue-white disk glar- 
ing in a pale night sky, casting sha- 
dows like the memory of a noonday, 
long ago. 

My instincts were as silent as 
everything else. Maybe the beating 
I’d been giving them all evening 
had given them the impression I 
didn’t need them any more. Maybe 
they were right. 

I hadn’t slowed down yet long 
enough to let what I had seen fil- 
ter through the fine sieve of my 
intellect: I had been playing it by 
ear from moment to moment. May- 
be that was the best technique, when 
half of what you saw was unbeliev- 
able and the other half was impossi- 
ble. 

I tried to raise Felix again; no 
answer. 

He had warned me to stay clear of 
police stations. After my reception 
at UN HQ it was easy advice to 
take. He had also told me to stay 
clear of his villa — except in emer- 
gencies. 

That meant now. I activated the 
left belt, rose quickly and headed 
west. 



THE HOUNDS OF HELL 



33 




N o light showed in the villa as 
1 came in on it from the east. 
I used my nearly depleted jets to 
brake to a stop against the flow 
of the river of dark night air and 
hovered, looking down on the moon- 
lit rooftop of Algerian tile, the neat 
garden, the silvery fields stretching 
away to the desert. I took the com- 
municator from the suit pocket, tried 
again to raise Felix. 

A sharp vibration answered my 
signal. I brought the device up close 
to my face. 

“Felix!” I almost shouted, my 
words loud in my ears inside the 
muffling field. “Where the hell have 
you been? — ” I broke off, sudden- 
ly wary. 

“John, old boy. Where are you? 
There’s been the devil to pay!” It 
was Felix’s familiar voice — but I had 
had a number of expensive lessons 
in caution since sundown. 

“Where are you, Felix?” 

“I’m at the house: just got in. I 
tried to check with you at the hotel, 
but little men with beady eyes 
seemed to be peering at me from 
every keyhole. I gave it up and came 
here. 

“Where’ve you been these last 
hours? Something’s going on in the 
town. Nothing to do with you, I 
hope!” 

“I tried to call you,” I countered. 
“Where were you?” 

“Yes — I felt the damned thing 
buzzing in my pocket. As it hap- 
pened, it wasn’t practical for me to 
speak just then. When I tried you, 
I got no reply.” 

“I’ve been busy. I guess I missed 
your buzz.” 



There was a moment’s silence. 
“So you were mixed up in what- 
ever it is that’s got them running 
about like ants in a stirred hill?” 
“Maybe. I want to see you. Meet 
me in town — at the Club.” 

“Is that safe, John?” 

“Never mind. Get started; half 
an hour.” I broke off. 

Down below, the house was a si- 
lent block of moonwhite masonry. 
A low-slung sports car squatted by 
the front door. Foreshortened trees 
cast ink-black shadows on the gravel 
drive. 

The front door opened, closed 
quickly. Felix’s tall, lean figure 
came down the steps, reached 
the car in three strides. He slid into 
the seat, started up, backed quickly, 
headed off along the curving way. 
His lights came on, dimmed. 

“All right, that’s far enough,” I 
transmitted. “I just wanted to be 
sure you were there, and alone.” 
Below, the car slowed, pulled to the 
side of the road. I saw Felix cran- 
ing his neck, his face a white blob 
in the pale light. 

“It’s that serious, eh, John? Right. 
Shall I go back to the house?” 
“Put the car in the drive and get 
out.” 

I dropped lower, watching him 
comply. I gained fifty feet upwind, 
curved in so that the wind would 
bring me across the drive. Felix 
stopped the car by the front door, 
stepped out, stood hands in pockets, 
looking around as though deciding 
whether it was a nice enough night 
for a stroll. 

I corrected my course and dropped 
lower. I was ten feet above the dry

IF 




lawn now, sweeping toward him si- 
lently at fifteen miles per hour. His 
back was toward me. At the last in- 
stant, he started to turn just as my 
toe caught him behind the ear in a 
neatly placed kick. 

He leaped forward, fell headlong, 
by face down, arms outflung. I 
Topped to the drive, shut down the 
field, stood with the gun ready in 
mv hand, watching him. 

The impact had been about right 
— not the massive shock of slam- 
ming against whatever it was that 
had masqueraded as General Julius, 
or the metal-shearing wrench that 
had torn the door handle from the 
car. I walked toward him, knelt 
cautiously, rolled him over. His 
mouth was half open, his eyes shut. 
I took the sheath knife from my knee 
pouch, jabbed him lightly in the 
side. The flesh seemed reassuringly 
tender. I took his limp hand, pricked 
it. The skin broke: a bead of blood 
appeared, black in the dim light. 

I sheathed the knife with a hand 
that shook. “Sorry, Felix,” I mut- 
tered. “I had to be sure you weren’t 
machined out of spring steel like a 
couple of other people I’ve met this 
evening.” 

I nside, I laid Felix on a low divan 
in the dark room, put a cold 
damp cloth on his forehead and 
waved a glass of plum brandy under 
his nose. 

There was a bluish swelling be- 
hind his ear, but his pulse and res- 
piration were all right. Within a 
minute he was stirring, making vague 
swimming motions and then, sudden- 
ly, sitting up, eyes open, his hand 



groping toward his underarm hol- 
ster. 

“It’s all right, Felix,” I said. “You 
had a bump on the head, but you’re 
among friends.” 

“Some friends.” He put a hand 
up. touched the bruise, pronounced 
a couple of Arabic curses in a soft 
voice. “What the devil’s up, John? 
I let you out of my sight for an hour 
or two, and the whole damned of- 
ficial apparatus goes into a Condition 
Red flap.” 

“I used the gear, Felix. I tracked 
a Bolo down a side trail, about three 
miles off the battle map. I saw 
things — - things I’m going to have 
trouble telling you about.” 

Felix was looking at me keenly. 
“Take it easy, old man. You look 
as though you’d had a bit of a shak- 
ing.” He got to his feet, wavered for 
a moment, went across to the bar. 

“No lights,” I said. 

“Who’re we hiding out from?” He 
got out glasses and a bottle, poured, 
came back and sat down. He raised 
his glass. 

“Confusion to the enemy,” he said. 
I took a sip, then a gulp. The Scotch 
felt as smooth as cup grease. 

“I’ll try to take it in order,” I 
said. “I watched the tank stop. The 
driver got out — and fell on his 
face.” 

“No shot, signs of gas, anything 
of that sort?” 

“Nothing. I was fifty feet away, 
and felt nothing, smelled nothing, 
saw nothing. Of course the field 


“Wouldn’t stop a gas, or a vibra- 
tory effect. Was there any fluoresc- 
ing of the field interface?”

IF 



I shook my head, went on with my 
story. Felix listened quietly until I 
mentioned the poisoned dart I had 
fired. 

His face fell like a bride’s cake. 
“You must have missed!” 

“After about two minutes, it got 
the message: yelped a few times, 
chased its tail, had a modest fit and 
died.” 

“My God! The thing must have 
the metabolism of a rock crusher. 
Two minutes, you say?” 

“Yep.” I went on. When I fin- 
ished, he frowned thoughtfully. 
“John, are you sure?” 

“Hell, I’m not sure of anything! 
The easiest hypothesis is that I’m out 
of my mind. In a way, I’d prefer 
that.” I fumbled, brought out the 
severed ear I had cut from the dead 
alien. 

“Here, take a look at this and then 
tell me I sawed it off poor old 
Bowser, who just wanted me to play 
with his rubber rat.” 

Felix took the two-inch triangle 
of course-haired gristle, peered at it 
in the near-dark. “This is from the 
thing in the canyon?” 

“That’s right.” I tried another 
pocket, found the printed hierogly- 
phics I had taken from the crea- 
ture’s pouch. “And this. Maybe it’s 
a simple Chinese laundry list — or 
a Turkish recipe for goulash. Maybe 
I’m having delusions on a grand 
scale.” 

Felix stood. “John . He eyed 
me sharply. “What you’ve turned up 
calls for special measures. We can’t 
take chances now — not until we 
know what it is we’re up against. 
I’m going to let you in on a secret 



I’ve sworn to protect with my life.” 
He led me to a back room, moved 
a picture, pressed unmarked spots on 
the wall. A panel slid back in the 
floor. 

“This is the Hole,” he said. “Even 
the CBI doesn’t know about it. We’ll 
be sure of avoiding interruption 
there.” 

“Felix — who do you work for?” 

He held up the severed ear. “Suf- 
fice it to say — I’m against the 
owner of this.” 

I nodded. “I’ll settle for that.” 
VII 

T hree hours later, Felix switched 
off the lights in the laboratory 
and led me into a comfortable lounge 
room with teak paneling, deep 
chairs, a business-like bar, and wide 
pseudo-windows with a view of a 
moonlit garden with fountains, 
which helped to dispel the oppres- 
sive feeling of being two hundred 
feet underground. I sat in one of the 
chairs and looked around. 

“Felix, who built this place? 
Somehow, this doesn’t look like a 
government-furnished installation to 
me. You’ve got equipment in that 
lab that’s ahead of anything I’Ve 
seen. And you’re not as surprised at 
what I’ve told you as you ought to 
be.” 

He leaned over and slapped me 
cm the knee, grinning his Mephisto- 
phelean grin. “Buck up, Johnny. I 
sent you out to find an explanation 
of something. You’ve found it — 
with bells on. If it takes a few 
devil-dogs from Mars to tie it all 
together, that’s not your fault.” 



THU HOUNDS OF HELL

“What the hell did I stumble into 
last night?” 

He finished mixing drinks, sat 
down across from me, rubbing the 
side of his jaw. The air conditioners 
made a faint hum in the back- 
ground. 

“It’s the damnedest tissue I’ve ever 
examined,” he said. “Almost a crys- 
talline structure. And the hairs! 
There are metallic fibers in them. 
Incredibly tough. The fluid was a 
regular witches’ brew; plenty of 
cyanoglobin present.” 

He shook his head. “Something 
out of this world, to coin a phrase.” 

“In other words, we’ve been in- 
vaded?” 

“That’s one way to put it — un- 
less someone’s invited them.” He put 
his glass on the table at his elbow, 
leaned forward. 

“We know now that whatever it 
was that was attached to the ear is 
responsible for the disappearance of 
men from battlefields and other 
places. From the number of such in- 
cidents, we can surmise that there 
are hundreds — perhaps thousands 
of these creatures among us.” 

“Why hasn’t someone seen them?” 

4i''T''hat’s something we have to 
i- find out. Obviously they em- 
ploy some method of camouflage as 
they go about their work. 

“Secondly, they’ve been busy 
among us for some time. Missing- 
persons figures were anomalously 
high as far back as World War One. 
That data for earlier conflicts are un- 
reliable, but such as they are, they 
don’t rule out the possibility.” 

“Apparently these creatures have 



a use for human brain tissue. From 
the description you gave me, I sur- 
mise that the organ was in a nu- 
trient solution of some sort — alive.” 
“My God.” 

“Yes. Now, we’re faced with not 
one, but two varieties of adversary. 
It’s plain that our former associate, 
General lulius, was something other 
than human. The same may be said 
of the individual who attempted to 
stop your car.” 

“They looked as human as I do. 
Maybe more so.” 

“Perhaps they are. Modified, of 
course, to serve alien purposes. Some 
such arrangement would be neces- 
sary in order to carry on the day- 
to-day business.” 

“What business — - other than 
brain-stealing?” 

“Consider for a moment. They’ve 
infiltrated the UN. From the speed 
with which they worked, it’s obvious 
that they have a large and well- 
integrated operation — and meth- 
ods of communication far more 
subtle than the clumsy apparatus we 
employ. As for your ‘accidentally’ 
meeting agents of the invader at 
every official contact, I’d say it’s 
likely that they control every offi- 
cial agency in Tambo'ula. In effect, 
the city is in their hands. 

“There are five million people 
here, Felix! Fifty governments are 
represented. I’ve only seen a couple 
of these Supermen.” 

“True. But they say for every rat 
you see in the barnyard, there are 
probably a hundred hiding some- 
where.” He looked almost pleased. 
“We’re on our own, John. We can’t 
shout for a policeman.”

IF 




“What can we do? We’re holed up 
under a hundred feet of shielded 
concrete, with plenty of food, liquor, 
and taped tri-D shows — but we 
might as well be locked in a cell — ” 
Felix held up a hand. “We’re not 
without resources, John. This hide- 
away was designed to provide the 
most complete and modern facilities 
for certain lines of research and 
iesting. We know a few things about 
our aliens now — things they don’t 
know we know. And I’m sure they’re 
puzzling over your dramatic appear- 
ances and disappearances much as 
we’re pondering their capabilities. 
They’re not super-beings. My little 
stinger killed one. You eluded oth- 
ers. Now that we know something 
of the nature of the enemy, we can 
begin to design counter-measures.” 
“Just two of us?” 

“I didn’t mean to imply that the 
enemy controls everything , John. It 
wouldn’t be necessary. One or two 
cowboys can control quite a large 
herd of cattle.” 

“Why herd us at all? Why not just 
round us up, chop out our brains 
and let it go at that?” 

“Oh, many reasons. Conservation 
of natural resources. Ease of har- 
vesting. And then, perhaps, we might 
not be quite safe, if we were once 
alerted to what was going on. Cattle 
have been known to stampede . 
“So — what do we do?” 

tt’IT Te leave Tamboula. Back in 
» r America, we make contact 
with a few individuals known to us 
personally. I’d steer clear of Bar- 
nett, for example, but there are a 
number of reliable men. Then we 



construct a counter-alien organiza- 
tion, armed and equipped. And then 
— well, we’ll see.” 

“And how do we go about leaving 
Tamboula? I have an idea the whole 
scheme breaks down right there.” 
Felix looked sober. “I’m afraid 
our old friend Bravais will never 
be seen departing from these shores.” 
I waited. A small grin was tug- 
ging at the corners of his mouth. 
“I think he’ll have to disappear in 
much the same manner that Major 
deSalle of the UN Medical Staff 
dropped from sight — and as one 
H. D. Brown, who leased the same 
house, will vanish one day soon.” 
“Behind a false beard and a set 
of brown contact lenses?” 

“Nothing so crude, my dear fel- 
low.” Felix was positively rubbing 
his hands together in anticipation 
now. “I’m going to give you the full 
treatment — use some of those ideas 
they haven’t been willing to give me 
guinea pigs for up till now. You’ll 
have a new hair color. Self-regener- 
ating, too. New eye color and retinal 
patterns, an inch or two difference 
in height, new finger and dental 
prints — ” 

“None of that will do me much 
good if some curious customs man 
digs under the dirty socks and finds 
that piece of ear. That’s all the 
evidence we’ve got.” 

“Never fear, John. You won’t be 
unprotected.” There was a merry 
glint in his eye now. “You won’t 
merely have a new identity. I’m 
going to fit you out with full PAPA 
gear. If a General Julius jumps out 
at you then, just break him in two 
and keep going.” 



THE HOUNDS OF HELL

viii* 

I was sitting od the edge of a 
wooden chair, listening to a thin 
bumming in my head. 

“Tell me when the sound stops,” 
Felix said. His voice seemed to be 
coming from a remote distance, 
even though I could see him, stand- 
ing a few feet away, looking hazy, 
like a picture shot through cheese 
cloth and faded. 

I pressed the switch in my hand. 
Felix’s blurred features nodded. 

“Good enough, John. Now come 
around and let’s check those liga- 
ment attachment.” 

I relaxed the muscles that had 
once been used to prick up the 
ears, thus switching my hearing 
range back to the normal. 1 made a 
move to rise and bounded three 
feet in the air. 

“Easy, John!” Felix had emerged 
from inch-thick arrear plastic walls. 
“We can’t have you springing about 
the room like a dervish. Remember 
your lessons.” 

I balanced carefully, like a man 
with springs tied to his shoes. “I 
remember my lessons,” J said. “Pain 
has a way of sticking in my mind.” 
“It’s the best method when you’re 
in a hurry, John.” 

“How did the test go?” 

“Not badly at all. You held it to 
.07 microbel at 30,000 cycles. How 
was the vision?” 

“About like shaving with a 
steamed mirror. I still get only blacks 
and whites.” 

“You’ll develop a color discretion 
after a while. Your optic center has 
been accustomed to just the usual 



six hues for thirty-odd years It 
can’t learn to differentiate in the 
ultra violet range overnight.” 

“And I can’t adjust to the feeling 
that 1 weigh half an ounce, either, 
dammit! I dance around on my toes 
like a barefooted hair-dresser on a 
hot pavement.” 

Felix grinned as though I’d paid 
him a compliment. “In point of fact, 1 
you now weight three hundred and 
twenty-eight pounds. I’ve plated an- 
other five mills of chromalloy onto 
the skeletal grid. Your system’s 
shown a nice tolerance for it. I’m 
pulling one more net of the number 
nine web over the trapezius, deltoids 
and latissimi dorsi — ” 

“The tolerances of my metabolism 
are not to be taken as those of the 
management,” I cut in. “These past 
six weeks have been a vivisectionist’s 
nightmare. I’ve got more scars than 
a Shendy Tribesman, and my netves 
are standing on end and waving 
around like charmed snakes. I’m 
ready to call it a day and try it as 
is.” 

Felix nodded soberly. “We’re 
about finished with you, John. I 
know it’s been difficult, but there’s 
no point in taking anything less than 
our best to the fray, is there?” 

“I don’t know why I don’t ache 
all over,” I grumbled. “I’ve been 
sliced, chiseled and sawed at like a 
side of beef in a butcher’s college. I 
suppose you’ve got me doped to the 
eyebrows. Along with all the other 
strange sensations, a little thing like 
a neocaine jag would pass unno- j 
ticed.” 

“No — no dope. Hypnotics, old 
boy.”

“Swell. Every day in every way 
I’m hurting less and less, eh?” 

I took a breath, more from habit 
than need. The oxygen storage 
units installed under the lower edge 
of my rib cage were more than half 
charged; I could go for another two 
hours if I had to. “I know we’re in 
a hell of a spot — and it’s better to 
sail in with grins in place and all 
flags flying than sit around telling 
each other the crisis has arrived. But 
I’m ready for action.” 

Felix was looking at papers, pay- 
ing no attention at all. 

“Surely, old man. Gripe all you 
like,” he said absently. “Just don’t 
get friendly and slap me on the 
back. I’m still made of old-fashioned 
flesh and blood. Now, I’d like an- 
other check on the strain gauges.” 
I closed my mouth and went across 
to the Iron Man — a collection of 
cables and bars that looked like an 
explosion in a bicycle factory. 

“The grip, first.” 

I took the padded handle, settled 
my hand comfortably, squeezed 
lightly to get the feel of it, then put 
on the pressure. I heard a creak 
among the levers; then the metal 
collapsed" like a cardboard under 
my hand. 

I let go. “Sorry, Felix. But what 
Ihe hell, thin-guage aluminum . 

“That’s a special steel tubing, cold- 
extruded, two tenths of an inch 
thick,” Felix said, fingering the 
wreckage. “Try a lift now.” 

I went over to a rig with a heavy 
horizontal beam, bent my knees, 
settled my shoulders under it with a 
metal-to-wood clatter. I set myself, 



slowly straightened my legs. Tho 
pressure on my shoulders seemed 
modest — about like hefting a heavy 
suitcase. I came fully erect, then 
went up on my toes, pushing now 
against an almost immovable resist- 
ance. 

“Slack off, John,” Felix called. “I 
believe I’ll consider you’ve passed 
your brute-strength test. Over twen- 
ty-nine hundred pounds. About what 
a Chevette runabout weighs — and 
I don’t think you were flat out at 
that.” 

“I could have edged a few ounces 
more.” I flexed my shoulders. “The 
padding helped, but it wasn’t quite 
thick enough.” 

“The padding was two inches of 
oak.” He looked at me, pulling at 
his lower lip. “Damned pity I can’t 
take you along to the next Myoelec- 
tronics Congress. I could make a 
couple of blighters eat two-hour 
speeches saying it wasn’t possible.” 

I took a turn up and down the 
room, trying not to bounce at 
each step. 

“Felix, you said another week to 
let the incisions heal. Let’s skip that. 
I’m ready to go now. You’ve been 
in town every day, and haven’t seen 
any signs of abnormal activity. The 
alarm’s died down.” 

“Died down too damned quickly 
to suit me,” he cut in. “It’s too 
quiet. At the least, I’d have expected 
someone out to check over the 
house. You’ll recall that the former 
tenant, my alter-ego, turned in a 
report on missing men and head 
wounds; but they haven’t been near 
the place. There’s been nothing n

the papers since the first day or 
two — and I daresay that it wouldn’t 
have been mentioned then, except 
that a crowd of idlers saw you kill 
Julius.” 

“Look, Felix. I’ve got so damned 
much microtronics gear buried in 
my teeth I’m afraid to eat anything 
tougher than spaghetti. I’ve got a 
laser wired into my left ring-finger, 
and enough servo-motors bolted to 
my insides to power an automatic 
kitchen. Let’s skip the rest of the 
program and get going. I may nave 
new stainless-steel knuckles, but it’s 
the same old me inside. I’m getting 
the willies. I want to know what 
those hell-hounds are doing up 
there.” 

“What time is it, John?” Felix 
asked suddenly. 

I glanced at the black-and-chrom- 
ium wallclock. “Twenty-four min- 
utes after nine,” I said. 

Felix raised his hand and snap- 
ped his fingers — 

I felt a slight twitch — as though 
everything in the room had jumped 
half an inch. Felix was looking at 
me with a quizzical smile. 

“What time did you say it was?” 

“Nine twenty-four.” 

“Look at the clock.” 

I glanced at it again. “Why, is 
it — ” I stopped. The hands stood 
at ten o’clock sharp. 

“Clock manipulation at a dis- 
tance,” I said. “How do you do it 
— and why?” 

Felix shook his head, smiling. 
“You’ve just had another half-hour 
session in deep hypnosis, John. I 
want another couple of days to re- 
inforce that primary personality 



fraction I’ve split off before I tie it 
in with a mnemonic cross-connec- 
tion. We want your alter-ego to be 
sure to swing into action at the 
first hint of outside mental influ- 
ence.” 

“Speaking of psychodynamics, 
how are you coming along with your 
own conditioning?” 

“Pretty well, I think. I’ve been 
attempting to split off a personality 
fraction for myself. I’m not sure 
how effective my efforts have been. 
Frankly, autohypnotics were never ; 
my strong suit. Still, there are a few ] 
facts that I can’t afford to expunge j 
from my mind completely — but on 
the other hand, I can’t afford to 
let the enemy have them. I’ve buried 
them in the alternate ego, and keyed 
them to a trigger word. The same i 
word is tied to my heart action.” j 
“In other words — if anyone cues ] 
this information, it’s suicide for 
you.” I 

(i /Correct,” Felix said cheerfully. 

“I need the basic power of 
the survival instinct to cover this 
information. I’ve given you the key 
word under hypnosis. Your subcon- 
scious will know when to use it.” 
“Pretty drastic, isn’t it?” 

“It’s tricky business, trying to out- 
guess a virtually unknown enemy. 
But from their interest in brains, 
it’s a fair guess that they know a 
bit about the mechanics of the hu- I 
man mind. We can’t rule out the 
possibility that they possess a tech- \ 
nique for controlling human mental 
processes. I can’t let them control 
mine. I’ve too many secrets.” 

I chewed that one over. “You

may be right. That tank driver 
didn’t behave like a man who was 
running his own affairs. And what- 
ever it was that hit him and the 
major — ” 

“It could have been an amplified 
telepathic command — to stop 
breathing, perhaps — or shutting off 
the flow of blood through the car- 
otid arteries. From the fact that it 
didn’t affect you, we can assume 
that their technique is selective. It 
probably requires at least a visual 
fix on the object, for a start.” 

“We’re assuming a hell of a lot, 
Felix. We’d better do some more 
field work before we reason our- 
selves right out onto the end of a 
long limb.” 

Felix was looking thoughtful. “It 
shouldn’t be too difficult to arrange 
shielding around the personality 
center area. A platinum-gauge 
micro-grid with a filament spacing 
of about — ” 

“Oh-oh. This sounds like another 
expedition into the seat of what I 
once thought of as my intelligence.” 

Felix clucked. “I can handle it 
with a number 27 probe, like build- 
ing a ship in a bottle. It could make 
a great difference — if it works.” 

“There’s too much guesswork 
here, Felix.” 

“I know,” he nodded. “But we’ve 
got to extract every possible ounce 
of intelligence on the enemy from 
the few fragments of data we have. 
I don’t think we’re going to have 
much in the way of a second 
chance.” 

“We’ll be doing well if we have 
a first one.” 

“You are getting nervy.” 



“You’re damned right! If I don’t 
get going soon, I may funk the 
whole act and retire to a small farm 
near Nairobi to write my memoirs.” 
Felix cackled. “Let’s dial ourselves 
a nice little entrecote avec cham- 
pignon and a liter or two of good 
Burgundy and forget business for 
an hour or two. Give me three more 
days, John. Then we’ll make our 
play- — ready or not!” 

IX 

T he night air was cold and clean. 

Gravel crunched under my feet 
with a crisp, live sound. Felix tossed 
our two small bags in the boot of 
the car, paused to sniff the breeze. 

“A fine night for trouble,” he 
said briskly. 

I looked up at the spread of fat, 
multi-colored stars. “It’s good to be 
out, after fifty days of stale air and 
scalpels,” I said. “Trouble or no 
trouble.” I slid into my seat, taking 
care not to bend any metal. 

“We’ll have to register you as a 
lethal weapon when this caper is 
over,” Felix said, watching me gin- 
gerly fasten my seat belt. “Mean- 
time, watch what you grab if I take 
a corner a trifle too fast.” He start- 
ed up, pulled off down the drive 
turned into the highway. 

“It’s not too late to change plans 
and take the Subsea Tube to Na- 
ples,” I said. “I have a negative vi- 
bration when it comes to rocket 
flights. Why not go underground, 
the way the Lord intended us to 
travel?” 

“I won the deck-cut, old boy,” 
Felix said. “For myself, I’ve had 



THE HOUNDS OF HELL 



43 




enough of the underground life for 
now. I want a fast transit to New 
York." 

“I feel a little exposed right now,” 
I said. “Too damn bad we don’t 
have two OE suits.” 

“Wouldn’t help if we did. You 
couldn’t get aboard an aircraft, tube 
or anything else without showing up 
on a dozen different monkey-busi- 
ness detectors. But we’ll be all right. 
They aren’t looking for me — - and 
your own mistress wouldn’t know 
you now. You’re good-looking, boy!” 
“I know. I’m just talking to keep 
myself occupied.” 

“You have our prize exhibit all 
cozy in your trick belt?” 

“Yep.” 

We drove in silence for the next 
mile. The city lights glowed on our 
right as we swung off on the part 
road. We pulled into a mile-wide lot 
under banked polyarcs, rode a slip- 
way to the rotunda, a glass-walled 
arena under a paper-thin airfoil can- 
tilevered out in hundred yard wings 
from supporting columns of ferro- 
concrete twelve feet in diameter at 
the base. I concentrated on walking 
without hopping while Felix led the 
way across to an island of brighter 
lights and polished corners where 
showgirls in trim uniforms stamped 
tickets and gave discouraging an- 
swers to male passengers with three- 
hour layovers to kill. 

I watched the crowd while he went 
through the formalities. 

There were the usual fat ladies 
in paint and finger rings, slim 
haughty women with strange-look- 
ing hats, bald businessmen with wilt- 



ing linen and a mild glow expensive- 
ly acquired at the airport bar, damp- 
looking recruits in rumpled uni- 
forms, thin official travelers with 
dark suits, narrow shoulders and 
faces as expressive as filing cabinets. 

Once I spotted a big black and 
tan German shepherd on a leash, 
and twitched: my foot hit a parked 
suitcase, sent it cannonballing against 
the counter. Felix stepped in quick- 
ly, soothed the fat man who owned 
the mishandled luggage, guided me 
toward a glass stairway that swept 
up to a gallery lined with live-look- 
ing palms. We headed for a pair of 
frosted glass doors under three-foot 
glare letters reading ALOHA ROOM 
in flowing script. 

“We have nearly an hour before 
take off Time for a light snack and 
a stirrup cup.” Felix seemed to be 
in the best of spirits now. The fresh 
air had revived me, too. The sight 
of the normally milling crowds, the 
air of businesslike bustle, the bright 
lights made the memories of stealthy 
horrors seem remote. 

We took a table near the far 
side of the wide, mosaic-floored, 
softly lit room. A smiling waitress 
in leis and a grass skirt took orders 
for martinis. Across the room, a 
group of bow-legged men with flam- 
boyant shirts strummed guitars. 

Felix glanced around contentedly. 
“I think perhaps we’ve overestima- 
ted the opposition, John.” He lit up a 
dope-stick, blew violet smoke toward 
an ice bucket by the next table. 
“Another advantage of rocket travel 
is the champagne,” he remarked. 
“We can be nicely oiled by the time 
we fire retros over Kennedy.” 



IF 




“While we’re overestimating the 
enemy, let’s not forget that he has a 
number of clever tricks we haven’t 
quite mastered yet,” I put in. “Get- 
ting out of Tamboula is a start; but 
we still have the problem of contact 
when we reach the States. We won’t 
accomplish much hiding out in back 
rooms over tamale joints, sneaking 
out at night for a pictonews to find 
out what’s going on.” 

Felix nodded. “I have some ideas 
on that score, John. We’ll also need 
a quick and inconspicious method of 
identifying ‘human’ aliens. I think I 
know how that can be done. We can 
work with the radar albedo of the 
alien skin, for example: it must be a 
rather unusual material to withstand 
puncturing steel doors.” 

He was smiling again, looking 
happy. He leaned toward me, talk- 
ing against a strident voice from the 
next table. 

“I’ve been working for twenty 
years, preparing for what I’ve term- 
ed a ‘surreptitious war’, based on the 
premise that when the next conflict 
took place, it would be fought not 
on battlefields, or in space, but in 
the streets and offices of apparently 
peaceful cities: a war of brainwash- 
ing techniques, infiltration, subver- 
sion, betrayal. It’s been in the air 
for a hundred years now: a vast in- 
sanity that’s kept us flogging away, 
nation against nation, race against 
race — with the planets at our finger- 
tips, beckoning . 

S omething was happening. The 
music was changing to a sour 
whine in my ears. The chatter at the 
tables around me was like the petu- 



lant cries of trapped monkeys in 
vast, bleak cages. 

Felix was still talking, jabbing with 
a silver spoon to emphasize his 
points. My eyes went to the double 
doors fifty yards distant across the 
brittle-patterned floor. Beyond the 
obscure glass, dark shapes moved 
restlessly, like dim shadows of crawl- 
ing men. 

I pushed my chair back. “Felix!” 
I croaked. 

“ — could have established a per- 
manent colony of perhaps five 
thousand. Carefully picked person- 
nel, of course — ” 

“The door!” My voice was chok- 
ing off in my throat as though a 
hand were crushing it. The air in 
the room seemed to darken; tiny 
points of light danced before me. 

“Something wrong, old boy!” Fe- 
lix was leaning toward me. a con- 
cerned expression on his face. He 
looked as unreal now as a paper 
cutout — a cardboard man in a card- 
board scene. Far across the room 
the door swung silently open. A star- 
ing corpse-pale face appeared at the 
level of a man’s belt. It pushed into 
the room, the long, lean, bristled 
body pacing on legs like the arms of 
apes, the fingered feet slapping the 
floor in a deliberate rhythm. A 
second beast followed, smaller, with 
a blacker coat and a grayish ruff 
edging the long-toothed face. A 
third and fourth passed through the 
door, both rangy, heavy, their long 
bodies sagging between humped 
shoulders and lean flanks. The lead- 
er raised his head, seeming to sniff 
the air. 

“Felix!” I pointed. 



THE HOUNDS OF HELL 



45 




He turned casually, let his gaze 
linger a moment, then glanced at 
me with a slight smile. 

“Very attractive,” he said. “You 
must be recovering, John, for a 
pretty face to excite you — ” 

“Good God, Felix! Can’t you see 
them!” 

He frowned. “You’re shouting, 
John. Yes, I saw them.” I was aware 
of faces turning toward me at the 
surrounding tables, eyebrows raised, 
frowns settling into place. I reached 
out, caught Felix’s arm. His face 
contorted in a spasm of agony. 

“Felix! They’ve come! Four of 
them!” 

He smoothed his features with 
an effort, tugged against my grip. 
His eyes were stricken. 

“Johnny — the strain has been too 
much for you — ” he started. 

“Felix, you’ve got to listen. What 
do you see coming through that 
door!” 

“Four young women,” he said in 
a choked voice, “Very gay, very 
sweet. Would that I had time . .” 
His face was paling. “John, you’re 
breaking my arm!” 

I jerked my hand back. “They’re 
aliens, Felix! The dog things I saw 
in the ravine! Look again! Try to 
see them!” 

The leading demon had turned 
toward us now. The white face was 
fixed on me as it came on, steadily, 
relentlessly, stalking unnoticed along 
the aisle between the tables where 
diners laughed and talked, forking 
food into over-fed mouths. 

Felix turned, stared. “They’re 
coming toward us,” he said in a 
voice thin with strain. “The first 



young lady is dressed in yellow — ” 
“It’s a thing like a tailless dog: 
a skull-face, stiff black hair. Re- 
member the ear!” 

F elix tensed: an uncertain ex- 

pression crept over his face. 
He turned toward me. 

“I — ” he started. 

His features went slack: his head 
lolled, eyes half open. The music 
died with a squawk. Conversation 
drained into silence. 

The first of the montrosities quick- 
ened its pace: its head came up as 
it headed straight for me. I leaned 
toward Felix, shouted his name. He 
muttered something, slumped back, 
stared vacantly past me. 

“Felix, for God’s sake, use your 
gun!” I jumped up. My knee caught 
the table. It went flying against the 
next one: Felix tumbled back, slam- 
med to the floor. I caught a momen- 
tary impression of dull-faced pa- 
trons. sitting slackly at tables all 
around. There was a quickening slap 
of beast-hands now as the leading 
thing broke into a clumsy gallop, 
closing now, red eyes glinting, the 
black tongue lolling from the side 
of the wide jaws as it clearing the 
last few yards, sprang — 

With a roar of horror, I swung 
my right fist in a roundhouse blow 
that caught the monster squarely 
on the neck. 

It went crashing across a table in 
an explosion of silver, glasses and 
laden plates, to go down between 
tables in a tangle of snowy linen; 
then the second demonic thing was 
on me. I saw dagger-teeth flash, 
ducked aside, caught a thick fore-

IF 




arm, feeling the flesh tear under my 
hand as I hurled it aside. The 
beast whirled, squealing thinly, rear- 
ed up seven feet tall — 

I struck at it, saw its face col- 
lapse into pulped ruin. It fell past 
me, kicking frantically. The last 
two attackers split, rushed me from 
both sides. I ran toward the one on 
the left, missed a swing at its 
head, felt the clamp of teeth on my 
arm, the impact of its weight like a 
feather mattress, I staggered, caught 
myself, slammed blows at the bris- 
tled side. It was like pounding a 
saddle. I struck for the head then, 
saw skin and flesh shear under the 
impact, struck again, knocked an 
eye from its socket — 

And still the thing clung, raking 
at me with its pale hands like min- 
strel’s gloves. 

I reached for its throat with my 
free hand, whirled to interpose its 
body between me and the last of the 
four creatures as it sprang: the im- 
pact knocked me back a step, sent 
the attacker sprawling. It leaped 
up, slunk around to the left of a 
fallen table to take me from the 
side. 

A t that moment, to my horror, the 
music resumed. I heard a 
tinkle of laughter, an impatient call 
for a waiter. Beyond the crushed 
head at my arm, with its single 
hate-filled eye, I caught a glimpse 
of the animated faces of diners, 
busy forks, a raised wine-glass — 
“Help me, for the love of God!” 

I roared. No one so much as glanced 
in my direction. 

I ripped at the locked jaws on 



my arm, feeling bone and leather 
shred and crumble. With a sound 
like nails tearing from wood, the 
fangs scraped clear, shredding my 
sleeve. The long body fell back, 
slack. I threw it aside, turned to 
face the last of the monsters. Bale- 
ful red eyes in a white mask of 
horror stared at me across a table 
ten feet away where a man with a 
red-veined nose sniffed a glass 
thoughtfully. On the floor at my 
feet, Felix lay half under the body 
of a dead demon. 

Now the last of the four crea- 
tures moved in. Beyond it, I saw a 
movement at the entrance: the door 
swung wide. Two demons came 
through it at a run, then another — 
The thing nearest me crouched, 
wide mouth gaping. It had learned 
a measure of caution now: I took 
a step back, looked around for a 
route of escape — 

“Now!” a silent voice seemed to 
shout in my mind. “Now!” 

I took my eyes from the death’s 
head snarling three yards away, fixed 
my eyes on Felix’s face. 
“Ashurbanipal!” I shouted. 

Felix’s eyes opened — dead eyes 
in a slack face. 

“The Franklin Street Postal Sta- 
tion in Coffeyville, Kansas,” he 
said in a lifeless monotone. “Box 
1742. Code.” 

There was a rasp of horny finger* 
on the floor, a blur of movement 
as the demon sprang. It landed 
full on Felix’s chest, and I saw its 
boned snout go down. 

I threw myself at it, grappled 
the bristled torso to me, felt bones 
collapse as we smashed against a

table, sent it crashng down. I kicked 
the dead thing aside, scrambled up 
to see a pack of its fellows leaping 
to the attack, more boiling through 
the open doors. I caught a glimpse 
of Felix, blood covering his chest — 
then I leaped clear and ran. 

Far across the wide room, tall 
glass slabs reared up thirty feet to 
the arched ceiling. Tables bounded 
to left and right as I cut a swathe 
across the crowded flcar. Ten feet 
from the wall, I crossed my arms 
over my face, lowered my head and 
dived. 

There was a shattering crash as 
the glass exploded from its frame. 
I felt a passing sting as huge shards 
tumbled aside. There was a mo- 
ment of whipping wind; then I 
slammed against the concrete ter- 
race as lightly as a straw man, rolled, 
came to my feet, sprinted for the 
darkness which lay beyond the light- 
ed plaza. 

Behind me glass smashed. I heard 
the thud of heavy bodies spilling 
through the opening, the scrabble of 
feet. People whirled from my path 
with little screams; then I was past 
them, dashing across a spread of 
lawn, then crashing through under- 
brush like spiderwebs and into the 
clear. In the bright moonlight the 
stony desert stretched to the sea- 
cliffs a mile distant. 

Behind me, I heard the relentless 
gallop of demonic pursuers. In my 
mind was the image of the com- 
rade I had left behind — the in- 
comparable Felix, dead, beneath a 
tidal wave of horrors. 

I ran — - and the Hounds of Hell 
bayed behind me. 



X 

I huddled in a sea-carved hol- 
low at the base of a crumbling 
twenty-foot cliff of sandy clay, 
breathing in vast gulps of cold, 
damp air, hearing the slap and hiss 
of the surf which curled in phosphor- 
escent sheets almost to my feet. Far 
out on the black, Mediterranean, 
gleaming points of light winked on 
the horizon: ships lying to anchor 
in the roadstead off Tamboula. 

I pulled my coat off. peeled my 
blood-stiffened shirt from my back. 
By the light of the moon I exam- 
ined the gouges across my left fore- 
arm, made by the demon’s teeth. 
Tiny gleaming filaments of metal 
showed in the cuts. The thing’s 
fangs had been as hard as diamond. 

Cold night wind whipped at me. 
Felix hadn’t thought to install any 
insulation in the course of the re- 
modeling. 

I tore a sleeve from my shirt, 
bound up my arm. There were cuts 
on my face and shoulders from the 
glass. Not deep and, thanks to Felix’s 
hypnotic commands, not painful — 
but blood was flowing freely. I got to 
my feet and waded out ankle-deep, 
scooped cold salt water in my 
wounds, then pulled my shirt and 
coat back on. It was all I could do 
in the way of first aid. Now it was 
time to give my attention to survival. 

I didn’t know how many miles I 
had run — or how far behind the 
dog-things trailed me. Perhaps I had 
escaped them. I keened my hearing, 
not breathing, hoping there would 
be nothing but the deep sigh of the 
wind . 



THE HOUNDS OF HELL 



49 




From far across the plain, I heard 
the slap of galloping beast-hands, 
how many I couldn’t tell. 

There was a chance that if I 
stayed where I was in the shelter of 
the cliff they might pass me by. 
But they had come unerringly to 
me as I sat in the bright-lit res- 
taurant with Felix — 

The thought of my dead compan- 
ion was like a ghostly knife-wound 
in my chest. Felix, the urbane, the 
elegant! I remembered his jaunty 
smile, the irrepressible high spirits 
that had met every challenge with a 
counter-attack. And now, he was 
alone back there, dead, under a tidal 
wave of demons. 

I wouldn’t wait here, to be cor- 
nered in the dark. Better to meet 
them in the open, kill as many as I 
possibly could before they bore me 
down. 

There was a narrow strip of wet, 
boulder-dotted beach running along 
the base of the sheer wall behind 
me. I went a few yards along it, 
splashing through shallow pools. An 
earth-fall had made a shelving slope 
to the level ground above. 

At the top, I lay flat and looked 
out across the pebbled plain. I saw 
that I was at the tip of a tongue of 
desert thrusting out into the sea, 
a narrow peninsula no more than 
a hundred yards wide at its base, 
narrowing to the point where I lay. 
Far away, the city was a pink glow 
against the sky. Near at hand, I 
saw dark shapes that could very 
well have been rocks — or crouch- 
ing enemies. 

I squinted down hard to trigger 
my visual boaster complex. The 
50 



desert sprang into instant, vivid clar- 
ity. Every stone fragment, mesquite 
bush, darting ground rat, stood out 
as under a full moon. 

A hundred yards away, a long, 
dark-glistening creature bound- 
ed from the shelter of a rock slab, 
swinging its pale, snouted face from 
right to left, then back, as it ran. 

Over the roar of surf, the distant 
whirr and clatter of night-locusts, 
the pad of its feet was loud now. 
Its breathing was a vile intimacy in 
my ears. 

When the thing was fifty feet 
away, it stopped abruptly, one white 
hand raised. Its gleaming eyes turn- 
ed toward my hiding place. Then it 
leaped straight toward me. I came 
to my feet, caught up a head-sized 
rock that seemed as light as cork, 
threw it; it slammed off the crea- 
ture’s flank with a sound like a brick 
hitting a board fence, knocked it off 
its feet — but the thing was up in an 
instant, leaping across the last few 
yards — 

I leaned aside, swung a kick that 
went home with a thud, then chop- 
ped a bone-smashing blow behind 
the shoulder ruff, felt the spine shat- 
ter. The thing struck heavily, rolled 
lay for a moment, stunned. Then the 
head came up. It moved feebly, scra- 
bbling with its front legs — toward 
me. I felt the skin prickle along 
the back of my neck. 

“What are you?” I called hoarsely. 
“Where do you come from? What 
do you want?” 

The ruby eyes held on my face; 
the broken body lunged forward an- 
other foot. 



IF 




“You understand me! Can’t you 

speak?” 

Still it dragged itself on, its jaws 
smiling their skull-smile. The smell 
of its blood was a poison chemical 
reek. I looked back toward the city. 
Far away, I saw movement — low 
shapes that galloped silently. From 
all across the barren plain they 
streamed toward the point of land 
where I stood, summoned by the 
dying creature at my feet. 

I stood at the edge of the cliff 
above the breaking surf, watching 
them come. 

It was useless for me to run any 
any farther. 

Even if I escaped the trap I had 
entered, there was no refuge along 
the coast. Algiers was sixty miles to 
the east. To the west there was noth- 
ing between me and Oran, over a 
hundred miles away. I could run 
for half an hour before oxygen ex- 
haustion forced me to stop, cover 
perhaps twenty miles, but the aliens 
would follow with the patience of 
death. I was cornered, brought to 
bay. 

Out across the dark water, the 
nearest ship lay no more than two 
miles offshore. 

The dog-things were close now. I 
could see them silhouetted against 
the lesser skyglow, like some evil 
swarm of giant rats, piped from their 
lair by the music of Hell. A plague 
of demons. The leaders slowed, com- 
ing on cautiously, dozens of them, 
almost shoulder to shoulder — 

I turned, leaped far out toward 
the black surf below; felt the icy 
waters closing over me. Swimming 
just above the muddy bottom, I 
THE HOUNDS OF HELL 



struck out for deep water, heading 
out to sea. 

T he ocean floor by night was a 
magic land of broken terrain, 
darting schools of many-colored 
fishes, waving screens of green, tran- 
slucent weed. A hundred feet from 
shore the bottom fell away and I 
swept out over a dark chasm, feeling 
the chill currents of deep water as I 
angled downward. The small fish 
disappeared now. A great, dark, lazy 
shape sailed toward me out of black- 
ness, was swallowed up in gloom. 
There was noises, grunts, shrill 
whistles, the grind and thud of tide- 
stirred rocks on the bottom, the dis- 
tant, mechanical whirring of a pro- 
pellor-driven boat. 

After twenty minutes, my vision 
began to blur. I was feeling the 
strain in my arms and the first 
stifling sensations of oxygen starva- 
tion. I angled upward, broke the 
surface, saw the low silhouette of a 
half-submerged vessel a quarter of a 
mile away across rippled ink-and-sil- 
ver water, streaked with the winking 
reflections of her deck lights. 

I trod water, looking around. A 
bell-buoy clanged a hundred yards 
distant. Farther away, a small boat 
buzzed toward shore from a ship 
farther out. There was a smell of 
sea-things, salt, a metallic odor of 
ship’s engines and a vagrant reek of 
oil. 

There was no indication of pur- 
suit from the shore. 

I swam on toward the ship, came 
up on her from the starboard quar- 
ter, made out the words EXCALI- 
BUR — New Hartford in raised let- 

51 




ters across her stern. There was a 
deckhouse beyond a low guard rail, 
a retractable antenna array perched 
atop it with crimson and white lights 
sparkling at the peak. Farther for- 
ward, small deck cranes poised over 
an open hatch like ungainly herons 
waiting for a minnow. I caught a 
faint sound of raucous music, a mo- 
mentarily raised voice. The odor of 
petroleum was strong here, and there 
was a glistening, filmy scum on the 
water. 

She was a tanker, loaded and ready 
to sail, to judge from the waterline, 
a foot above her anachronistic plim- 
soll. 

I pulled myself up on the corrod- 
ing hull-plates, inched my way to the 
rail, crossed to the deckhouse. The 
door opened into warmth, light, the 
odors of beer, tobacco smoke, un- 
laundered humans. I took a great, 
grateful lungful. This was familiar, 
reassuring; the odor of my kind of 
animal. 

S teep stairs led down. I followed 
them, came into a narrow cor- 
ridor with a three-inch glare-strip 
along the center line of the low ceil- 
ing. There were doors set at ten-foot 
intervals along the smooth, buff-col- 
ored walls. 

Voices muttered at the far end 
of the corridor. 

I stepped to the nearest door, 
listened with my hearing keened, 
then turned the handle and stepped 
inside. 

It was an eight-by-ten cell papered 
with photo-murals of Central Park, 
chipped and grease-stained at hand 
level. There was a table, a metal lock- 
52 



er, a hooked rug on the floor, a tidy 
bunk, a single-tube lamp clamped to 
the wall above it beside a hand- 
painted plaster plaque reprsenting a 
haloed saint with a dazed expression. 

Footsteps were coming along the 
corridor. I turned to the door as it 
opened and nearly collided with a 
vast, tall man in a solid undershirt 
bulging with biceps, blue trousers 
worn low to ease a paunch that 
looked slight against his massive 
bulk. 

He stared down at me, frowning. 
He had curly, uncut hair, large, 
dull-brown eyes, a loose mouth. 
There was a deeply depressed scar 
the size of an egg on the side of his 
forehead above his left eye. He 
raised a hand, pointed a thick finger 
at me. 

“Hey!” he said, in a startingly 
mellow tenor. He blinked past me 
at the room. “This here it my flop.” 

“Sorry” I said. “I guess I kind of 
stumbled into the wrong place.” I 
started past him. He moved, blocking 
the door. 

“How come you’re in my flop?” 
he demanded. He didn’t sound 
mad — just mildly curious. 

“I was looking for the mate,” I 
said. “He must be down the hall, 
eh?” 

“Heck no. The mate got a fancy 
place aft.” He was looking me over 
now. “How come you’re all wet?” 

“I fell in the water,” I said. “Look, 
how are you fixed for crew aboard 
this ship?” 

The giant reached up, rasped at 
his scalp with a fingernail like a 
banjo pick. 

“You want to sign on?” 



IF 



“Right. Now — ” I started. 

“Who you want to see, you want 
to see Carboni. Oh, boy.” The loose 
mouth curved in a vast grin. “He’ll 
be surprised, all right. Nobody don’t 
want to sign on aboard the Scabbier.” 

“Well, I do. Where do I find 
him?” 

The grin dropped. “Huh!” 

“Where can I find Mr. Carboni 
— so I can sign on, you know.” 

The grin was back. He nodded 
vigorously. “He’s prob’ly down in 
the ward room. He’s prob’ly pretty 
drunk.” 

“Maybe you could show me the 

way.” 

He looked blank for a moment, 
then nodded. “Yeah. Hey.” He was 
frowning again, looking at my shoul- 
der. “You got a cut on ya. You 
got a couple of cuts. You been in a 
fight?” 

“Nothing serious. How about Mr. 
Carboni . .” 

The finger was aimed at me like a 
revolver. “That’s how come you 
want to sign on the Scabbier. I bet- 
cha. You croaked some guy, and 
the cops is after ya.” 

“Not as for as I know, big boy. 
Now — ” 

“My name ain’t Big Boy. It’s 

Joel.” 

“Okay, Joel. Let’s go see the man, 
all right?” 

“Come on.” He moved out of the 
doorway, started off along the cor- 
ridor, watching to be sure I was fol- 
lowing. 

“Carboni, he drinks a couple of 
bottles and he gets drunk. I tried that 
but with me it don’t work. One time 
I drank two bottles of booze but all 



it done, it made me like burp.” 
“When does the ship sail?” 
“Huh? I dunno.” 

“What’s your destination?” 
“What’s that?” 

“Skip it Joel. Just take me to your 
leader.” 

A fter a five-minute walk along 
criss-crossing passageways, we 
ducked our heads, stepped into a 
long, narrow room where three men 
sat at an oilcloth-covered table 
decorated with a capless ketchup 
bottle and a mustard pot with a 
wooden stick. 

There were four empty liquor bot- 
tles, on the table and another, near- 
ly full one. The drinker on the op- 
posite side of the table looked up as 
we came in. He was a thick-necked 
fellow with a bald head, heavy fea- 
tures, bushy eyebrows, a blotchy 
complexion. He sat slumped with 
both arms on the table encircling 
his glass. One of his eyes looked 
at the ceiling with a mild expression; 
the other fixed itself on me. A frown 
made a deep crease between the 
eyes. 

“Who the hell are you?” His voice 
was a husky whisper. Someone had 
hit him in the windpipe once. It 
hadn’t improved his manners. 

I stepped up past Joel. “I want 
to sign on for the cruise.” 

He swallowed a healthy slug of 
what was in the glass, glanced at his 
companions, who were hitching, 
around to get a look at me. 

“He says it’s a cruise,” he rasped. 
“He wants to sign on, he says.” The 
eye went to Joel. “Where’d you pick 
this bird up?” 



THE HOUNDS OF HEU

Joel turning, said, “Huh?” 

“Where’d you come from, punk?” 
The eye was back on me again. 
''Mow’d you get aboard?” 

“The name’s Jones,” I said. “I 
swam. What about that job?” 

“A job. he says.” The eye ran over 
me. “You’re a seaman, eh?” 

“I can learn.” 

“He can learn, he says.” 

“Not many guys want to sign on 
this tub, do they, Carboni,” Joel 
asked brightly. 

“Shut up,” Carboni growled with- 
out looking at him. “You got blood 
on your face,” he said to me. 

I put my hand up, felt a gash 
across my jaw. 

“1 don’t like this mug’s looks,” 
one of the drinking buddies said in 
a voice like fingernails on a black- 
board. “A chain-climber. I got a 
good mind to throw him to hell off 
back into the drink where he came 
from. He looks like some kind of a 
cop to me.” He was a long-faced, 
lanky, big-handed fellow in grimy 
whites. He had a large nose, coarse 
receding gums. 

“Do I get the job or not?” I said, 
looking at Carboni. 

“I’m talking to you, mug,” the 
long man said. “I asked you if you 
are a cop.” 

“Who runs this show?” I said, still 
watching Carboni. “You or this talk- 
ing horse?” I jerked a thumb at 
the latter. He made an explosive 
noise, started getting up from the 
bench. 

“Sit down, Pogey,” Carboni snarl- 
ed. 

The lanky man sank back, talking 
to himself. 



itnpbat’s a pretty good swim out 
from shore,” Carboni said. 
“You musta been in a pretty big 
hurry to leave town.” 

I didn't say anything. 

“Cops after you?” 

“Not that I know of.” 

“Not that he knows of, he says.” 
Carboni grinned. He had even white 
teeth; they looked .as though they 
had cost a lot of money. 

“Any papers?” 

I shook my head. 

“No papers, he says,” Carboni re- 
layed. 

“You want me I should pitch him 
over the side, Carboni?” the third 
man spoke up. He was a swarthy 
man with stubby arms and a crook- 
ed jay. like a dwarfed giant. 

“Cap’n wouldn’t like that,” Joel 
said. “Cap’n said we needed crew.” 
“Up the captain,” the horsey man 
with stubby arms and a crooked jaw, 
said. “We don’t need no — ” 
“Pogey,” Carboni cut in. He roll- 
ed the eye over to bear on him. 
“You talk too much. Shut up.” He 
jolted his chair back, turned, lifted 
a phone off a wall bracket, thumbed 
a call button. The glass eye was 
rolled over my way now, as though 
watching for a false move. 

“Skipper, I got a bird here says 
he’s a seaman,” Carboni said into 
the instrument. “Claims he lost his 
papers.” There was a pause. “Yeah,” , 
Carboni said. “Yeah.” He listened 
again, then hitched himself up in the 
chair, frowning. He glanced toward 
me. 

“Yeah?” he said. 

I let my gaze wander idly across 
the room — and switched my hearing

‘ f 




into high gear. Background noises 
leaped into cracking presence. The 
hum of the phone was a sharp 
whine; I heard wood and metal 
creak, the thump of beating hearts, 
the glutinous wheeze of lungs ex- 
panding, the heavy, grate of feet 
shifting on the floor — and faintly, 
in an excited voice: 

“ ...UN radio a gun bumped 

off somebody maybe a couple .... 

try for a ship they said. Cripes, looks 
like.” 

Felix had said that with a little 
concentration, I could develop se- 
lectivity. I needed it now. I strained 
to filter the static, catch the words: 

. handle him?” 

Carbone looked my way again. 
“Can a kid handle a lollipop?” 

"Okay. Look.” The voice was 
clearer now. lousy local cops 
... we turn this guy in . reward 
peanuts . their problem. We need 
hands, we work this boy . get 
there . Stateside cops . a nice 
piece of change . .” 

“I see what you mean, Skipper,” 
Carboni said. He had a corner of 
his mouth lifted to show me a smile 
that I might have found reassuring 
if I’d been a female crocodile. 

“Get him down below. Anchors 
up in an hour and a half. Shake it 
up.” 

“Leave it to me, Skipper.” Car- 
boni hung up, swung around to give 
me the full face smile. The bridge- 
work wasn’t so expensive after all, 
just old style removable plates. 

“Well, I decided to give you a 
chance, Jones,” he croaked. “You’re 
on. You’ll sign papers in the morn- 
ing.” 



“Hey, okay if he helps me out in 
the hot-room and stuff?” Joel en- 
quired. He sounded like a ten-year- 
old asking for a puppy. 

Carboni thrust out his lips, nod- 
ded. “All right, Jones; for now, you 
help the dummy. Take the flop next 
to his.” 

“By the way, where’s this tub 
headed?” I asked. 

“Jacksonville. Why? You choosy 
or something?” 

“If I was, would I be here?” 

C arboni snorted. “Anchors in in 
an hour.” He leveled the eye 
on Joel. “Get moving,” he barked. 
“What do you think this is, a rest 
home for morons?” 

“Come on.” Joel tugged at my 
arm. I followed him out, along cor- 
ridors to a door. He opened it, flip- 
ped on a light, showed me a room 
identical with his own except that it 
lacked the plaster saint and the 
hooked rug. He opened the locker, 
tossed sheets and a blanket on the 
bed. I pulled off my wet jacket. 
Joel puckered his mouth, looking at 
me. 

“Hey, Jones, you better get Doc 
to fix them cuts you got.” 

I sat on the bunk. I felt weak 
suddenly, sucked as dry as a spider’s 
dinner. There was a humming in 
the back of my head, and my face 
felt hot. I pulled the sodden make- 
shift bandage from the arm the dog- 
thing had chewed. There were four 
deep gouges, half a dozen shallower 
ones — all inflamed, swelling. The 
arm was hot and painful. 

“Can you get me some antiseptic 
and tape?” I asked. 



56 



IF 



“Huh?” Joel grunted. 

“Is there a first-aid kit around?” 

Joel pondered, then went into the 
corridor, came back with a blue- 
painted metal box. 

In it I found a purple fluid which 
bubbled when I daubed it on my 
wounds. Joel watched, fascinated. 
At my request he applied some to 
l he cuts on my back, working with 
lotal concentration, his mouth hang- 
ing open. If he saw the glint of 
metal filaments in the torn skin he 
made no comment. 

I folded gauze; Joel helped me 
tape it in place. When we finished, 
he stood back, smiling. Then he 
frowned. 

Hey, Jones. How come you didn’t 
get Doc to fix you up?” 

“I’ll be okay,” I said. 

Joel nodded as though I had clar- 
ified a difficult point. He looked at 
me, frowning. He was thinking 
again. 

“How’s come Carboni’s scared of 
you?” he asked. 

“He’s not scared of me, Joel,” I 
said. “He took a shine to me on 
sight.” 

Joel thought that one over. 
“Yeah,” he said. “But look; we got 
stuff we got to do. We got to get a 
move on.” 



I stood up, acutely aware of fa- 
tigue, and wounds, and a sensa- 
tion similar to a ticking bomb be- 
hind my eyes. Felix’s post-hypnotic 
anesthetic had been a big help while 
it lasted, but the withdrawal symp- 
toms evened the score. 

“I want to go up on deck a min- 
ute,” I said. Joel blinked, followed 
me as I retraced the path along 
which I had come half an hour ear- 
lier. I stepped out onto the deck, 
shivered in the wet clothes as the 
freshening wind hit me. There were 
no lights on the shore opposite. 
Half a mile to the left, there was a 
faint gleam from the windows of 
beach shacks; farther along, the 
great arc of the dredged harbor was 
a line of jewels against the dark 
night. 

I tensed the eye squint mucsfes, 
saw the black water snap into gray 
misty clarity. On its surface, nothing 
stirred. I attuned my hearing to 
pick up the softest of night sounds. 
There were the thousand pings and 
thumps from the ship, the creak of 
the anchor cables, and the crump 
and hiss of the distant surf. 

If the demons were close, they 
were well hidden. For the moment, 
it seemed, I was safe. I was. I 
wasn’t so sure about the world.

THE HOUNDS OF HELL 



57 




IF • Short Story 




BY SIMON TULLY 



He searched the stars for 
a perfect race — and found 
what perfection really is! 



T he largest of the symmetroids 
sat down. And, in an order 
that was just far enough off simul- 
taneity for a very attentive observer 
to notice the sequence, the others 
followed him. 

To call it “sitting down” involved 
giving the phrase a much wider than 
usual meaning. But Streeve was by 
now quite used to employing the 
patterns of his native language in 
novel ways, in order to guide his 
thought along the behavior types of 
the symmetroids. 

“Sitting down” usually involves 
bending of certain limbs, jerky move- 
ments of the rest of the body and a 



sudden halt as the sitting down mem- 
ber hits the sitting down surface. But 
the symmetroids seemed to com- 
press themselves, rather like a large 
balloon letting out half its air. Or 
else it was as if gravity had suddenly 
doubled, so that each part of their 
bodies — twice as heavy as it had 
been before — concertinaed against 
the part below it. The general im- 
pression, however, wasn’t really one 
of air escaping, or of weight in- 
creasing. It was simply of their taking 
up a resting, non-mobile position: 
and that was why Streeve called it 
“sitting down”. 

He checked the time and made 





an entry in his notebook. Then 
whilst the people were eating, he 
went over the day’s route and com- 
pared it with the corresponding day 
of the last cycle. 

That was quite unnecessary, since 
he remembered the landmarks and 
resting places in great detail — he 
had been past them so many times 
that it would be impossible not to. 
But Streeve was well trained. He 
had been taught that efficient ob- 
serving is wasted without detailed 
recording. A note book and sharp 
pencil were always in his hand. 

For the first time in thirty years 
of field work, Streeve was restless. 
He had only ten notebooks left, out 
of an original five hundred. Yet he 
had nowhere near enough data to 
return home and write his thesis. 
It was painful to review the chang- 
ing moods of his time on the sym- 
metroids’ planet, and he indulged 
in this pain too often for his own 
liking. When he and the nineteen 
other young anthropologists of his 
class had been given a final briefing 
they were warned that it was un- 
usual to discover a suitable race in 
under three years. Even after find- 
ing one, seven years was thought a 
reasonable time for a complete sur- 
vey of their habits and tastes, and a 
description of the language. 

But Streeve ran across the sym- 
metroids in the first week on his 
assigned continent. As he began pre- 
parations for establishing commun- 
ication his mood had been one of 
exultation. 

I t had been made plain to Streeve’s 
class that the first suitable peo- 



ple they came across were to be 
their object of study. No one was 
allowed to search for a second group 
if, for example, the one first en- 
countered presented difficulties of 
communication. So that it was par- 
ticularly unfortunate, in view of 
Streeve’s lack of results, that the 
symmetroids were plainly quite suit- 
able for field study. 

They certainly had some sort of 
social organization. A different sym- 
metroid was likely to sit down first 
each night. But several years of ob- 
servation had established that this 
was by random choice out of proba- 
bilities strictly assigned to every 
member of the race. Streeve had 
arranged the symmetroids along a 
hierarchy of importance, according 
to the size of each one’s probability 
rating. This correlated with the part 
different symmetroids played in var- 
ous ceremonies and rites. For in- 
stance, each symmetroid mated with 
a frequency that was determined 
by its importance. 

Or at least he assumed they were 
mating when two of the people 
juxtaposed their symmetrical bodies 
and began rotating them in opposite 
directions, always touching each 
other, so that the larger, of the pair 
moved around the smaller one. 
(There could be no strict division 
of the sexes since the smaller in one 
instance of mating was often the 
larger in another.) They moved fas- 
ter and faster until eventually all 
Streeve could see was a rotating 
elliptical blur. Then, as they slowed 
down again, he would gradually 
be able to make out three revolving 
bodies: a larger going around a smal- 



THE PERFECT PEOPLE 



59 




ler as before, but now a third, infant 
symmetroid moving in figure-of- 
eight fashion around and between 
the two original bodies. 

And they seemed to have some 
means of communicating with each 
other. If .?. symmetroid in the rear 
suddenly stopped — Streeve still had 
no idea what the reason for this 
could be — the leaders would imme- 
diately return and, by grouping a- 
round the ailing member, presum- 
ably do what was needed to cure 
him. It had taken some time for 
Streeve to notice that they never 
“turned around” when they went 
back to help a colleague (it was 
the only time they ever did go back 
for anything). Or rather, they never 
“rotated” : Streeve decided that “turn 
round” was inapplicable to a people 
who had no front or back or sides, 
but whose bodies were made up of 
a number of circular rings, varying 
inches in diameter and piled to a 
height of up to ten feet. 

Streeve was still as far away as 
he had ever been from finding out 
how they communicated. But the 
more he thought about it the more 
he accepted this, and was surprised 
that no anthropologist had ever ex- 
perienced difficulty of this kind be- 
fore. They might use sounds that 
were outside his threshhold of hear- 
ing: or light signals in the ultra- 
violet or infra-red ranges: or else 
some form of telepathy. He inclined 
towards the last alternative, once 
his hypothesis about their direction 
of movement had been checked and 
verified. 

The symmetroids always moved 
along together, in a straggly line 



which would certainly have some 
definitive criterion determining each 
one’s position in it — but whatever 
this was, Streeve had yet to work 
out. The leading symmetroid seemed 
to move toward the direction in 
which there were the least num- 
ber of trees; the direction in which 
movement would be easiest. 

There was only one kind of plant 
on the continent, and Streeve was 
aware that he was extending the 
usual meaning of the word “tree” 
by applying it in this context. But 
the term seemed less unsuitable than 
any other for the flat-topped, tele- 
graph-pole-like growths, with rings 
that looked like long-play records 
of different sizes growing symmet- 
rically out of their stems. The “trees” 
occurred in any sort of pattern: 
in round clumps, in straight lines, 
in six-pointed star designs, or just 
individually, with no obvious shape 
to their distribution. 

B y exercising what Streeve liked 
to think was a “radar sense,” 
the symmetroids always moved to- 
wards the most open ground, the 
direction in which they would have 
most freedom of movement. Their 
course was continually changing, as 
the possibilities in front of them 
altered, so that they appeared at 
first sight to be moving in a random, 
drunken wind. 

If necessary, they would presum- 
ably be able to return the way they 
had come in the event of encount- 
ering an impenetrable cul-de-sac; so 
that they never need stop or bump 
into anything. But the trees were 
never very thick, and during Streeve’s 



60 



IF 




thirty years of study a complete 
turn-about with the interesting ques- 
tion of instantaneous change of 
leader — had never occurred. 

When he first hit upon the “mov- 
ing in ijiost open direction” hypo- 
thesis, after seven-and-a-ha!f years, 
Josei Streeve had made the first of a 
series of widely scattered and quite 
unscientific comments in his note- 
book: This race is surely more per- 
fect than any other known to us. 
Their life is quite systematic, com- 
pletely determined and yet, at a 
guess, entirely satisfying. 

Now they were eating. Or at least 
Streeve called it eating. 

The biggest circle of a symmetroid 
body was about halfway up and 
every evening, after they had been 
sitting for a few minutes, each 
would spurt a fountain of some 
liquid from the whole circumfer- 
ence of the largest ring into a gap 
which opened around the third-to- 
topmost ring. It was easy to see 
that the same two rings were in- 
volved in each case — although each 
symmetroid had a total of seventy- 
nine rings — because of their color- 
ing. The large feeder circle was a 
dirty yellow, the same color as the 
trees, and the fed ring was pure blue, 
in contrast to the mingled shades 
of red and brown that covered the 
rest of their bodies. 

Mainly, Streeve called it “eating” 
because of the other function of the 
yellow ring. Every morning the 
symmetroids would rise in a body, 
and each approach a different tree. 
Two of them would never choose 
the same tree: Streeve recognised 
the basis of allocation to be such 



that the total distances moved by 
the symmetroids to their individual 
trees should be minimum. Once each 
was under its tree (getting there 
was no difficulty, since the lowest 
branch on any tree was at about 
twelve feet) it rotated quickly a- 
round it, so that the symmetroid’s 
widest ring always extended for about 
two inches under the tree’s lowest 
branch. Between the sixth and nine- 
teenth revolutions a liquid sprayed 
down from the tree into a cavity 
around the top edge of the yellow 
circle. 

T he time that elapsed between 
their sitting down and eating 
(which they did from a sitting-down 
position) varied from one minute to 
over two hours. Streeve had yet to 
find a formula to explain the in- 
terval although he felt sure he 
should be able to. Although they 
did not sit down quite simultane- 
ously, he had never been able to 
detect the minutest difference in 
their feeding times. Similarly, al- 
though one of them would get 
up a fraction of a second before 
the others in the morning (and it 
was never the one that had sat 
down first the previous evening) 
they would gather their food at 
precisely the same moment. 

Sometimes they slept — or at least 
remained motionless — for three 
hours, sometimes for sixteen. The 
only sure feature was that they stop- 
ped before sundown and rose after 
dawn — once only three seconds 
after, but the following day five 
hours later. At first Streeve tended 
to oversleep, and had once or twice 



THE PERFECT PEOPLE 



61 




spent days looking for them. But 
with practice he woke after three 
hours, and every half-hour after that, 
even though it was now unnecessary. 

He still could not predict to the 
slightest extent what time they would 
stand up and begin moving: but he 
knew exactly the course they would 
take. 

I n Streeve’s fourteenth year he had 
the glimmering of another hypo- 
thesis. 

His excitement compelled another 
unscheduled entry: If I am right, 
the ultimate link is in place. This 
race must be considered the most 
perfect people known to man. 

It took five more years to be cer- 
tain, and six more after that before 
he wrote : They are< I am convinced, 
THE perfect people. He found 
that the symmetroids moved along 
a closed path, so that they completed 
a circuit, and passed the same land- 
marks, every two hundred and seven 
days. 

As far as he could remember, and 
from the notes he had made, this 
had been the case since his ninth 
year. He was almost certain that be- 
fore then they had not been on this 
circuit. He could remember a desert 
that took fifteen days to cross (he 
called it a “desert” for want of a bet- 
ter term, since there were only a 
quarter as many trees as usual), 
several clumps of plants shaped like 
swastikas, and a large hole in the 
ground which, fortuitously, had lain 
just off the symmetroids’ course. He 
could not be quite sure of all this, 
for he had still been puzzled by their 
seemingly inexplicable wandering 



course for most of the initial nine 
years, and the written record some- 
times made little sense now. But if 
he was right, if .. 

If l am right, then these people 
have attained complete perfection 
only during my time here. For just 
twenty-one. years their lives have 
beer absolutely predestined the 
predestination being determined by 
their own past behavior! 

For although an open course can 
lead into a closed one, a closed one 
can only be followed — forever. 

However, after thirty years, Stre- 
eve was restless. He had been total- 
ly unable to communicate with the 
symmetroids. If he approached them 
he seemed merely to be regarded as 
another plant, and their course al- 
tered accordingly. They could, if 
they wished, move faster than him, 
so that he had yet to touch one. 
By a carefully planned maneuver 
he had once forced them to change 
their leader and almost reverse di- 
rection for a few yards. 

But that was very little to show 
for half a lifetime of attempted con- 
tact. Should be return home? 

Certain failure in his Ph. D. would 
mean permanent drafting to the un- 
derwater army. Or was it better to 
stay on here, to fill the last ten note- 
books as slowly as he could, and 
hope for an earthquake — although 
he had been told they were non-ex- 
istent on this planet — or a forest 
fire — although it rained every 
night and the trees never dried out 
— to alter the status quo, and give 
him a new opportunity for com- 
municating with the symmetroids. 

Streeve’s speculations were inter- 



62 




rupted. The people had risen, led by 
an eight-foot high symmetroid whose 
probability of standing up first was 
held by Streeve — - on the. basis of 
ten samples of a thousand days each 
— to be only one in one-hundred- 
and-thirty-nine. Their food gathered, 
Ihey set off along the usual path at 
a standard three miles per hour. 
Streeve followed, still half thinking 
about returning at once — he had 
not seen his transit craft since land- 
ing but was confident he could get 
back to it in fifty days. 

He noticed a star-shaped clump 
of trees ahead that rather looked as 
if it had one arm a little shorter 
than the other, something he couldn’t 
remember having seen around here 
before. But the trees were thick 
enough in this area for this not to 
be surprising. In fact, there was lit- 
tle to choose between several dif- 
ferent directions at this stage of the 
circuit. 

And he thought he could feel — 
or maybe he just imagined — that 
the leader’s pace slowed a little, per- 
haps as he took longer to select the 
most open course. 

I t wasn’t until three hours later 
that Streeve became worried. 
The course seemed unfamiliar, 
and the pace had definitely slowed 
now, as the leader found each di- 
rection almost as completely wooded 
as every other. He cursed his slow 
thinking — dimmed by his years 
on this planet — for not having re- 
alized that a tree could fall down. 
The optimum need not necessarily 
remain constant from circuit to cir- 
cuit. Now the circle was broken! 



But the symmetroids were as im- 
passive as ever. Had they even re- 
alized that they were on a closed 
course? Streeve had intuitively guess- 
ed so, but his knowledge of their 
intelligence was slight, and he had 
no real reason for this belief. 

And even now, the hoped-for 
communcation. did not materialize. 

For the first time in years Streeve’s 
mind was racing. If they were the 
perfect people, how could they have 
ceased to be perfect? For ceasing 
to be perfect is an imperfection, 
which perfect people could never 
possess. Yet they had been perfect, 
as he understood perfection, and had 
now paten tty ceased to be completely 
perfect. How could this be? 

As he pondered the paradox, 
Streeve followed the people through 
a crack in the wall of trees. 

If this proved a dead end they 
would for the first time have to 
turn around But the path continued, 
and Streeve plodded after. 

Until both trees and earth sud- 
denly stopped before a type of ter- 
rain that Streeve had never seen on 
this planet. As he watched, still 
struggling with the paradox of 
perfection, the people moved on — • 
moved smoothly into the sea. 

Streeve hesitated for a moment. 
Then, before following them, he had 
time to scribble a final epigram on 
the last page of notebook number 
four-hundred-and-ninety. 

You may not believe it, but there 
are still some people who think it 
was wrong to award him a post- 
humous Ph.D. for a single sentence: 
The only perfect • people are 
dead people. END

: 

A man could defeat a soulless 
machine every time. But what 
if they were not — soulless ? 



T hey found a spot in the paddock 
area to park the station wagon, 
and carefully rolled the scarred old 
racer off its trailer. Ross and Gray 
eased it to the track gate while Ken 
took the VW bus around behind the 
pits. The savage sounds of racing 
engines raked the day and a fever 



burned in the air — engines, cars, 

competition. 

Speed. 

Two grinning marshals joked 
through their inspection as Ross and 
Gray stood statuelike. Like two old 
reprobates and a weathered dowager 
at a teenage brawl, Ross thought. 

They were finally passed onto the 
course and began pushing the crim- 





Prm 





jn car down the long pit lane, 
jleekei and shinier cars lashed past, 
'and, between the cries of their pass- 
ing, came the sideline comments. 

What the hell is that? 

Maybe a replica of an old acci- 
dent. 

A Ferrari! It’s a damned old 
F err aril 

Great Ghost! Are they going to 
race it? 

It must be on loan from the 
Italian Museum of Antique Arts. 

They did not bother to glance 
aside. Two battered old men pushing 
a battered old coupe; they had heard 
it all before. Many times. Too many 
times. 

They stopped in their pit area 
and Gray leaned over the roof to 
catch his breath. Ken had backed 
the bus in close behind the barrier 
and already raised the antenna. He 
swung open the rear door and 
turned, frowning, rubbing his hands 
on his hips. 

“Can we go? I’ve got a green -go 
on all power circuits.” 

Gray hunched into the engine 
compartment while Ross checked 
tires and fuel. Ken leaned over the 
barrier. 

“Okay?” 

Gray slammed the lid and but- 
toned it up. 

“Fire it,” he grunted. “Nothing’s 
wrong that hasn’t always been. You 
say all your little tubes and trinkets 
are warm?” 

“There aren’t any damn tubes 
and you know it.” 

Ken slammed into the back of the 
bus. Gray chuckled. 

“Boy’s spooky today.” 



Ross reached into the cockpit and 
flicked the switch. 

“He’s lost his practice time,” he 
said. “Can’t blame him. He still 
takes us seriously.” 

A glance flickered between them 
and Ross turned toward the 
bus. Ken was barely visible through 
the open rear door. Ross nodded, 
and Ken flicked switches in the bus. 

The Ferrari skirred, grumped and 
fired. Ross made a stirring motion 
with one hand; the engine raised its 
pitch, warming and smoothing. Gray 
opened the bonnet again and leaned 
over the rumbling engine. Fie made 
the barest adjustment to three of the 
carbs and nodded to himself. Ross 
raised a fist and twisted it. Thun- 
der rolled and heads turned to stare 
from the other pits. Gray looked up 
and grinned. Ross toned to Ken 
again and made a steering motion 
with both hands. 

In the cockpit, the blank staring 
manikin copied Ross’s action. Ross 
jabbed a fist in front of him. The 
manikin dropped a stiff hand and 
jerked through the gears. They raked 
slightly. Ross frowned and glanced 
at Gray, who just shook his head 
and slammed the bonnet. Ross 
raised his fist and motioned as if 
cracking a whip. The car snarled 
forward and stopped abruptly. 

“At least it can stop,” Gray 
frowned. 

A scowling marshal edged past 
the bus and scrambled over the 
barrier. He glared at them, at the 
car, and at his clipboard. 

“I’m Crandall, pit marshal. Want 
to see those brakes!”

IF 




Ro;s looked at Ken and whipped 
In- hand again. hard. 

The coupe squealed down the 
strip and slammed to a stop. Tire 
smoke drifted away. Crandall 
1 1 owned again at his board. 

"You Ross Eliot?” 

Ross nodded. Crandall blinked at 
him for a moment and referred 
again to his board. 

“And your operator is Kennith 
Manning. His license?” 

“Inside the side door of the bus.” 
“Urn. You’re late, Eliot. Is Man- 
ning familiar with this course?” 
“He’s raced it before. Anything 
else on your mind?” 

“Well, everything is in order, I 
suppose. You’re cleared. I just can’t 
understand why — ” 

Ross raised a hand and chopped 
il down and the Ferrari smothered 
them in an avalanche of sound. It 
roared down the pit lane and onto 
Ihe course like an unleashed ban- 
shee, leaving a wake of craning 
heads and muttering voices. Ross 
nnd Gray frowned after it. The 
gears had raked again. Crandall’s 
mouth was still open. Ross left him 
with his clipboard and turned to 
Gray. 

“That same damn thing.” 

Gray shrugged. 

“Well, it’s not clutch dragging. I 
promise you that!” 

Ross eased over the barrier and 
in the side door of the bus. Ken 
was seated at the console. His hands 
flicked over the board and his eyes 
never left the wide TV screen. 

Ross watched the road reel out 
of the depths of the screen and 
blur under the smooth red nose and 



fender swells. No sound came from 
the console; only the cry of cars 
passing the pit area, and that sound 
did not fit the action on the screen. 
Ross thought again how much this 
was like a movie rattier than the 
real thing . and not a very good 
movie at that. 

A corner came unwinding under 
the Ferrari’s nose. Ken shifted, and 
Ross frowned. 

“It’s still raking.” 

“I know,” Ken nodded. “I’m get- 
ting a red light but it’s just a flick- 
er. Watch.” 

His fingers danced on the board 
and the scene lurched slightly as the 
car shifted. A tiny light blinked red 
under transmission. 

“Can you match you rpm’s bet- 
ter?” 

“I try.” Ken shook his head. “But 
you know — ” 

“Yeah, I know. A surge of elec- 
tricity is different from a hand.” 

He slapped Ken on the shoulder 
and helped Gray unload tires and 
fuel cans. 

“Take a look at the clutch servo 
when it comes in.” 

Gray threw him a searing look. 

“A man wouldn’t even need a 
clutch!” 

“How much time we got?” Ken 
yelled. 

“About a half hour of practice. 
Maybe less.”

H e walked, hands in pockets, be- 
hind the pits and thought of 
Ken and Gray. And of himself. 
They were quite a group. Two old 



THE ULTIMATE RACER

fire eaters and a young one. Ken 
could unleash his flame through the 
console, and with such a blaze of 
skill and devotion that the old Fer- 
rari could still sing the high notes 
and earn her way; not winning — it 
had been a long time since she’d 
led the way home — but close 
enough to finance another race. 
Barely. And another. Always one 
more. 

And Gray and himself: they were 
too old for flames; they just seethed 
along. Two old bastards. No — make 
that three. The growling old Ferrari 
qualified too. Three old zombies 
still in there cluttering up the course. 
The ancient Triumvirate, long fallen 
and lacking the sense to crawl away. 

But that was the way with Oid 
Bastardsc too cranky to quit, too 
mean to die, too angry to know 
better. That was the way when the 
fire outlasted its function. You just 
seethed. 

He passed slowly behind the pit 
areas, crews feverish in the last in- 
tense moments of practice: Lafitte, 
Apache, Lotus, Volga, Porsche, 
1BM-GM, Abarth, Honda, Coven- 
try, GE-Ford. There were a few 
independents — as themselves — but 
with cars that showed no aging, in 
appearance or in name. And so 
many new names since the 1982 
“man ban.” But few of the old rac- 
ing companies had stayed. Some had 
faded quietly; some not. Enzo Fer- 
rari had not. He had gathered all 
his cars he could and sent them and 
the factory into the sky over Mo- 
dena. 

“No car of mine shall be subject 
to this shame,” he said then. But 



one car was — Ross’s, because Rosi 
had been a Ferrari team driver, an 
had hidden his car that thunderin 
day. And now was beginning to fe 
the edge of regret. And shame. 

He shouldered through the crow 
to the fence beyond the pits. 
Honda shrieked past with rpm’s t 
cower dogs for miles around. It shu 
off for Corner One, squealed its 
downshift and sang around an 
away. The crowd chattered in i 
echo. Like a gleaming green pro 
jectile, a Lotus arced into the cor 
ner. It was chased by two Fords an 
a Volga, servo-manikins jerkin 
their downshifts. Another Lotus slip 
streamed a Coventry past the pit 
The Coven went wide and the Lotu 
leaped smoothly inside the corne 
and came out first. Voices laugh 
and elbows nudged. Lotus was th 
Big Name now. Lotus was the ca 
to catch. He smiled to himself 
That hadn’t always been true. Ther 
had been another name — once. 

The crowd ruffled and heads 
turned, a silence came and eyes 
squinted up the long straight past 
the pits where the South Turn 
opened. Ah yes. The new challenger 
for the Lotus crown. 

They moaned down the straight 
in close V formation, less than an 
inch apart at 150 mph; three daz 
zling streaks of white that snapped 
crisp, simultaneous shifts, curved 
through Corner One and left tire 
smoke and six black scars on the 
pavement behind them. Grandstand- 
ing, Ross thought. They even have 
a showoff circuit. But there were 
cheers and cries of excitement 
around him, and, suddenly, he felt 



68 



very old. Old and empty. No, not 
empty. Old and angry. Old because 
he was; angry because this sleek 
beast, this IBM-GM could catch 
people’s imagination and enthusiasm. 

The IBM was more than a car 
with a puppet in it, more than a 
machine on the end of a transmitter. 
In the IBM pits, the consoles were 
nothing but monitors. The car was 
in command of itself. Machinery and 
electricity combined to drive itself, 
judge itself, race itself. The IBM- 
GM. 

The ultimate racer, they called it; 
machinery beyond man’s mistakes. 
Gray had another name for it. 

A familiar old wail rode up the 
sky, a commanding bellow that 
brought a smile to his craggy face 
and peering faces from the crowd. 
There! How many men and ma- 
chines had paid tribute to that 
voice? 

It lanced past the pits in a touch 
of thunder and curved for the cor- 
ner. Gears crashed in the downshift 
and it slithered for a second, then 
pulled through and away. Ross’s 
smile faded. A bad shift and too 
much brakes. Ken was getting jar- 
red by the gear rake. Voices hum- 
med behind him. 

Holy Robe! Was that a Ferrari? 

Yeah. It’s in the program. Ross 
Eliot! 

You’re kidding. 

No! Look! Ross Eliot: owner. 

I’ll be damned! Old Angry Man 
Eliot. 1 thought he was dead. 

Might as well be if that antique 
is the best he can do. 

Ross edged his way to the rear, 
one thought boring through him: 

THE ULTIMATE RACER 



go home, Eliot. Get out. They don’t 
race your way any more. You’ve 
provided comedy relief long enough. 
You’re dead. 

H e walked back slowly, listening 
to the snarling cars and his 
snarling mind. It was going to rain. 
Naturally. Who ever heard of a race 
without rain? But it would give them 
an edge. A slight edge. Their servo 
sat in a closed coupe and its lenses 
stayed dry and clean, while most of 
the modern cars were open and the 
servo lenses subject to everything 
the course had to offer. And in the 
rain it would cost them. 

Pit stops for wiping lenses! 

A slender figure stepped from the 
vehicles behind the Lotus pit and 
Ross put his head down, pretending 
not to notice. But the clipped, mock- 
ing voice halted him. 

“Hello there, Eliot.” 

He looked up. Finely cut face, 
crinkled eyes, neat mustache, care- 
less hair: “dashing” the press called 
him, and managed to overlook the 
arrogant curl in the corner of his 
mouth. 

“Hello, Stewart. How fly the 
Loti?” 

It was an old joke — but then so 
was he. 

“Rather well, as usual. I see you’re 
still coaxing mileage from the Ramp- 
ant Black Horse. Not sounding aw- 
fully well in the gears, is it?” 
“We’re cracking walnuts for 
lunch. Join us. I’ll save you the 
shells.” 

He shouldered past. God, what he 
would give for a Ferrari in his hands 
and a fast course and a field of 

69 




Lotus to pass. What he wouldn't 
give for — for anything right now. 

Ken sprinted from their pit area 
as he approached. Gray following 
as fast as he could. Ken saw him 
and wheeled. 

“I baled it. Ross. Missed third 
and Warren Corners.” 

“Okay. Get back on the board to 
drive it in. Gray and I’ll go out and 
have a look. It’ll run, won’t it?” 

The look on Ken’s face was like 
a bullet in his chest. 

“It’ll start — but I’ve got a full 
red light on the transmission.” 
“We’ll take the trailer then.” He 
paused, frowning at the gray sky. 
Today? The last broken leg for the 
Black Horse? He looked back to 
Ken. “Hell, boy! Quit looking like 
you just shot your father. We’ve 
been through the tules before.” 
“Yeah, but not with a bunged 
box. Hadn’t I better come in case 
we have to — have to haul it in?” 
Like pronouncing a death in the 
family, Ross thought. He unleashed 
a long breath and nodded, and felt 
something shudder loose inside. God. 
it was a helpless feeling to be out 
of luck, out of time, out of place. 

Ill 

I t wasn’t really hurt. Another 
scarred fender would hardly be 
noticed. Another dent in the air 
scoop made little difference. The 
wheels were still true. The front end 
was straight. The sump was sand 
polished but whole. It was still a 
fighting machine. 

But today was the day. No more 
“one more race.” 



Rain rattled on the roof of the 
VW. Ross finished and sat staring 
at Ken. 

“So that’s the last act, boy. E 
can’t even pay what I owe you.” 
Ken shook his head, gazing at , 
the rain-shiny racer on its trailer 
behind their pit. 

“Just one rotten, stupid, damned 
solenoid!” 

Gray snorted and juggled a screw- 
driver from hand to hand. 

“Just a solenoid they don’t even 
make any more!” 

“If we could only replace — ” 
“Quit dreaming, boy,” Gray said. 
“There isn’t a twenty-four volt sys- 
tem left in the business.” 

A slim figure plunged through 
the rain and grinned at them through 
the open side doors. 

“Well. Choke up on the walnuts, 
did it?” 

Ross glanced up. Yes, the smile 
was there. 

“Clutch solenoid.” 

“Oh. Too bad. Not like the old 
days, is it? Are you dead?” 

“We're dead,” Ross answered. 
“But we took a lot of killing, didn’t 
we?” 

“A damn shame, that. There’s 
nothing you can do? I mean, a clutch 
bugger is such a bloody little thing.” 
“It’s enough.” 

They listened for a moment to 
the calling of the small classes. Eu- 
gines growled in the pits. Stewart • 
spoke again. 

“Well, that’s the bitch of it, isn’t j 
it? I don’t suppose we could cobble 1 
something together. We have servos j 
that—” “ 

“Rack it, Mr. Lotus.” But Gray’s 



70 



IF 



voice had lost its edge. “That’s a 
car out there, not one of your ani- 
mated toys. We couldn’t convert it 
in a month and you know it!” 

Stewart gave a brittle laugh. 

“You’re right, of course, but 
that’s the running of it, isn’t it? I 
mean, you’ve had your day, haven’t 
you?” 

Ross stared at Stewart for a long 
time before he spoke. 

“Stewart, I’ve often wondered why 
you talk in questions,” he said quiet- 
ly. “And I wonder if it isn’t that 
you need the assurance of agree- 
ment. So I’ll agree with you this 
time. Yes, we’ve had our day. And 
it was a day you know very little 
about. It took men to match the 
machines then, Stewart.” 

Stewart flushed. 

“Times change, Angry Man. Rac- 
ing is — ” 

“Racing is a little girl’s business 
now. Playtime. An abortion born of 
electric trains and ‘Father Knows 
Best.’ And you’re proud of it, aren’t 
you, Stewart? You were a loud 
voice in the bringing of the ban. 
Loud and in a position to bray in 
the right ears. Why? What made you 
and the others push that through?” 

Stewart paused. 

“Well, it’s obvious, isn’t it? Men 
were dying! Needlessly! Mangled in 
the wreckage of their cars. Stupid 
deaths. What other reasons are 
necessary?” 

R oss gazed away at the drizzling 
rain and smiled. 

“I remember a young man with a 
new license and a new car. I remem- 
ber how he managed to blunder 



every race he entered. Strange. I 
understand he was a real ace with 
little electric cars on a little road 
racing course.” He glanced back at 
Stewart. “I wonder what was lacking 
in him that he couldn’t race a real 
car. I wonder why he felt he had 
to protect the lives of his fellow 
men. Such consideration, Stewart. I 
am honored. If it hadn’t been for 
you — and the others too, of course 
— I might be dead. I should thank 
you.” 

Stewart stiffened. His voice be- 
came even more clipped. 

“Yes. I think we have saved some 
lives.” 

“Saved, Stewart? Or taken away?” 

“I — don’t understand what you 
mean by that.” 

“I know you don’t.” A harsh edge 
came into Ross’s voice. “Run off 
now, Stewart. Go play with your 
toys. I’m tired of being protected.” 

One side of Stewart’s mouth lifted 
in a cold smile. 

“Too bad you couldn’t have kept 
racing, Eliot. You could have died 
a hero instead of becoming the pa- 
thetic thing you are now.” 

Ross nodded. 

“True. Perhaps I’ll drive today.” 

“Do that! Make a complete ass 
of yourself!” 

Stewart spun and strode into the 
rain, then stopped. 

“You were a great driver, Eliot. 
Too bad that people shan’t remem- 
ber you as one.” 

He swung away and was gone 
and no one spoke in the bus. The 
gray rain drummed on the roof and 
Ross stared at his cold and lonely 
racer. What is it? he thought. What

is it that links a man with the pulse 
and thunder of a car until his whole 
life is in that machine? That ma- 
chine there. That low, mean missile 
with a rearing black horse as its 
emblem. A car he had lived with 
and in and around for too many 
years. A car that was almost legend 
now. 

Ferrari. 

And eleven years of laughter and 
ridicule had never seen it finish last, 
not fail to finish. Until today. And 
today it would not even start. It 
was over. The last Ferrari was 
through. 

And what now?

The car. waxed and poised on hid- 
den blocks, marked and scarred and

and poised on hidden rods, marked 
and scarred and ugly. And the neat 
sign could read: 

Last Ferrari. Last driver and me- 
chanic. 

1981 Ferrari GTS 400; 5 liter 
V- 10. 615 bhp, 220 mph. 

Ross “Angry Man” Eliot ; World 
Champion, 1980, 1981. 

Gray “ Even Angrier ” Willard; 
mechanic and Old Bastard. 

And there could be more. Much 
more. Little awe-sparking notes to 
urge the grunts of wonder from the 
Sunday families. 

Broke course record at Schring 
five times in succession without 
brakes or clutch. 

Broke my little finger too in a 
bad shift. 

Won 1980 LeMans after passing 
through an eight-car tangle without 
touching a thing. 



Touched the brake. Once. 

Got nickname at Nurburg Ring 
after hurling his broken clutch pedal 
at the pit crew and going on to win 
German GP of 1979. 

Missed them, though 

Oh yes, they could tell it. Tell the 
big and tell the little. Give them all 
the facts and features. Play the roar 
and make them shudder. Show the 
films and have them wonder. 

But they could never touch the 
truth of what is was to be this man 
and this machine coupled in an act 
of living, how it was to ride in 
thunder with the touch of lightning 
underfoot and the rim of life in 
both hands. They could never tell. 

And the people would never 
know. 

He gazed at the car crouching 
on its trailer like a great poised cat. 
His machine. His mistress. And the 
cold goggling manikin bolted in the 
cockpit like an alien violator. His 
anger flamed. He turned to Gray 
and nodded. 

Gray smiled for the first time in 
years. 

“About time, Angry Man.”

K en’s voice was low and fe- 
verish in the closed bus. 
“You’re crazy, Ross! You’re 
crazy! You’ll be blackflagged out of 
racing for life. You!” 

“It has happened to better men. 
Some of them thought it was the 
only honorable thing to do.” 

“But you haven’t driven in over 
ten years. No one can just jump into 
it after that — not even you.”

“I remember where the gears are, 
boy. Yank on that other leg. It’s 
caught on a cable.” 

They were stripping the manikin 
of its coveralls. 

Ken exploded, “Kee-rist! You call 
prowling around a few courses in 
the dawn’s early light driving? I 
mean racing, Ross. I mean boring 
out there and working it!” 

Ross looked up, his voice flat. 
“Kenny, don’t tell me about rac- 
ing.” 

They stared a moment longer, and 
Ken glanced away. They both 
jumped like cats when the door 
banged open. Gray crowded in. 
shaking his head. 

“That Crandall,” he snorted. “He 
came snooping by and asked if we 
were still running. I told him, ‘Hell 
yes. We got a replacement part.' 
And he acted real disappointed. 
Watched me clear the pedals and 
then took off. The man’s got eyes 
like a truck’s got wings.” 

Ken suddenly snapped his fingers. 
“The video! How can I fake it 
without video? What if he peeks in 
here and I’m diddling in front of 
a blank screen?” 

“Good thought, Ken-boy.” Gray 
reached for the manikin’s head with 
its two sparkling eyes. He pulled a 
screwdriver from a hip pocket and 
started taking the skull apart. “I 
guess we can bale together some 
kind of a lash-up.” 

Ross slipped his legs into the 
coveralls, speaking quietly. 

“You don’t have to play the game, 
Ken. You know that.” 

“Yeah, I know.” 

“It’s a lifetime ban for all con- 



cerned. You’ll never get so much as 
a pit pass for the rest of your life.” 

“I know.” 

Gray plucked an eye tube from 
the skull, untangled its leads and 
started on the other. 

“You’re foolish, Ken-boy,” he 
said. “It doesn’t matter with us. Ross 
will probably slaughter himself, and 
I don’t know any better. But you’ve 
got a good future in this business. 
You can play that damn TV and 
piano better than anyone I’ve seen. 
Ross could get you a seat in a 
second.” 

Ken shook his head. 

“We might just pull it off.” 

“Dream and scheme,” Gray chuc- 
kled. “Nobody that’s ever tried it 
has pulled it off. It’s a last act, boy.” 

He removed the other tube, ram- 
med them both in a pocket and 
slipped out. The smaller classes had 
started and engines screamed through 
the rain. A Honda squalled by in 
the lead, followed, it seemed, by 
every fighting animal in the world. 
Ross lit a cigarette. His hands were 
shaking. The door yanked open 
again. They jumped. Crandall stood 
scowling from the shelter of a large 
umbrella. 

“Your mechanic says you’re still 
running!” 

“You’re damn right! And if you 
slam in here like that when my 
operator is on the board I’ll ram 
your clipboard right down your 
bloody throat! This is a private ve- 
hicle.” 

C xrandall sniffed, glared at the 
■* sprawling servo-manikin and 
slammed the door.

“Just put up with him the best 
you can, I guess,” Ross said. 

Ken leaned forward. 

“Have we any chance at all?” 
“Chance of what? Pulling it off? 
Getting into the money?” 

“Either. Both.” 

“Not much, no. Neither. You’ve 
seen how the marshals swarm the 
pits after a race for what they call 
‘inspection?’ Have you ever won 
dered why a car should be inspected 
after a race? They’re still looking 
for men drivers, boy. And they find 
them once in a while; old fools like 
me who think the old days were 
kind of fun, who don’t appreciate 
being kept from hurting ourselves. 
As far as dodging that and getting 
into the money — mouse guano! I 
always held that a man could beat 
a servo, but I don’t know now. 
These new outfits are fast! Did you 
know the IBM was radared at 198.7 
at Sebring this spring? It takes a 
big bale of machinery to do that, 
boy.” 

“But the Ferrari did 220.3 — ” 
“At Bonneville, Ken. Not on a 
race circuit.” He was silent for a 
moment, turning his old, battered 
helmet in his hands. 

“And pulling it off or placing 
isn’t really the point.” 

“What is, Ross? You’re not doing 
it just for the hell of it.” 

Cars snarled past, downshifting, 
lining for Corner One. Ross raised 
his head and listened. Two racers 
passed, one holding a second longer 
before shifting. He smiled. 

“Perhaps that’s it. Just for the hell 
of it. Damned if I do . .” He 
paused, squinting through a rain- 



flecked window at the Ferrari, bright 
and shiny now from the wet. “And 
surely damned if I don’t.” 

The door banged open again and 
Gray leaned in. 

“May God damn Crandall to ever- 
lasting hell! Try your screen.” 

Ken spun to the board and snap- 
ped a switch. The screen blinked on 
showing the blunt rear of the sta- 
tion wagon. 

“I put them in the air scoop. 
Told Crandall I was fixing a leak 
in the oil cooler.” Rain followed the 
lines of a grin down his cheeks. 
“He wanted to know why the mani- j 
kin was out. I told him it had to 
go potty. I swear, the man has never 1 
seen a real racer in his life! He 
asked, ‘What’s that lever sticking up 
from the floor?’ Judas! I should 
have said it was the crank that 
wound the spring.” 

Ross grinned as he pulled on his 
helmet. 

“You can go to hell for lying 
too.” 

“I’ll race you there. Let’s go 
before Old Peek and Peck comes 
back. I want to see if you remem- 
ber how to start it.” 

Ross pulled on his gloves and ad- 
justed his goggles. 

“Must cover my beady little eye 
tubes,” he grinned. 

“Better cover your big mouth 
too.” Gray grabbed his feet. “Grab 
its bead, Ken-boy. We’ll plug it in 
and see if it works.” 

“Jees!” Ken grunted. “It’s gotten 
a lot heavier.” 

“And limp too. For godsake, 
Ross, stiffen up! Who the hell ever 
heard of a limp servo?” 



74 



IF 



“You think I’m limp now, you 
old bastard, wait’ll you cut me out 
of that machine.” 

H e sat stiff behind the wheel, and 
not simply from imitating a 
servo. He was like a painting, in- 
credibly old and brittle and not very 
well done at that. 

The car was close around him. 
The water-smooth hood and fenders 
curved familiarly in front, the seat 
was firm and holding, the wheel 
hard in his hands. But he felt wrong. 
Alien. Not a part of anything here. 
And with the rain whispering softly 
on the top and the cold mist on 
his face from the open side window 
— it came to him why. 

He was the only man in this long 
row of quietly waiting cars. The 
only touch of life among this ma- 
chinery. And it was a cold lonely 
feeling. The chill loneness of an in- 
truder in an enemy land. 

And that made him angry too. 
Why should he be a stranger 
here? This was his country, wasn’t 
it? A car, a course, a competition! 

But the thought stood close be- 
hind him and would not leave. 

He glared at Gray poised across 
the track in his circle; a travesty of 
a Le Mans start in which the me- 
chanics ran to start the cars. The 
old goat will catch pneumonia, he 
thought. No hat! No raincoat. Just 
grizzled old Gray frowning in the 
rain, coveralls soaked and plastered 
to his wiry frame. 

He swivelled his eyes down the 
course. Crowds jammed the fences 
under a mushroom forest of um- 
brellas and makeshift canopies. A 



strange breed, he thought, mobbed 
together in the rain to watch a pack 
of cars fight. And what would 
they think if they knew a man was 
sitting in one of those cars? Would 
they be on his side? Would they be 
cheering him? 

Yes, he thought so. And that was 
a warm feeling; to have a crowd 
on your side. He had a sudden im- 
pulse to move, to show he was hu- 
man, but he didn’t. The cold mani- 
kins down the line stared straight 
and statuelike, and he copied them. 

Mist curled on Corner One and 
the pavement gleamed like polished 
glass. He ran the course again in 
his mind. He had raced it before 
the ban, but that had been long ago. 
Too long. Back when he was — 

His blood leaped and his hands 
tensed. The count had started. 

He watched Gray crouch — then 
spring, running like a boy. The long 
line of figures dashed across the 
wet track. Gray slipped and nearly 
went down, arms waving, then skid- 
ded alongside and rammed an arm 
through the window. 

“Go break a leg,” he breathed. 
Ross touched the starter. The big 
engine growled, roared, and he fired 
the Ferrari off the line, sliding 
slightly as he bent it down the track. 
And he smiled. 

Go break a leg! 

Go kill yourself. Into the tiger’s 
mouth! Join the dead men! Dares 
from the days of TCs and Cad-Al- 
lards and big white Mercedes, the 
calls of a clan who ran for the joy 
of it. Old words. Foolish. But some- 
thing old and foolish rides this 
course today 



THE ULTIMATE RACER

V 



H e was first away and leaning 
into third going into Corner 
One, and his mirrors showed a rag- 
ing flood of cars behind him. He 
caught fourth, skidded slightly on 
Corner Two, and dropped into fifth. 
His mirrors were crowded with 
headlights, airscoops, and flashing 
bodies. 

Well, let them come. If nothing 
more he’d lived the leap off the line 
again and been first into a race. 

A Lotus ripped by him, an IBM 
nearly in its tailpipes. They seethed 
under the Pirelli Bridge, spray plum- 
ing behind them, and downshifted 
for the Dogleg. He snapped down 
to fourth, then raked third and 
swore. The Lotus went into the 
corner too fast. It slithered wide 
and the IBM got by on the inside. 
He made a try but the Lotus re- 
covered and outpulled him going 
into the straight. Damn! The IBM 
hadn’t wavered a bit, and was al- 
ready gone down the mile straight 
in a boiling steam of spray. 

He shifted up to fifth again, 
squinting into the Lotus’s lashing 
contrail. Another IBM slammed 
past. Lord, they were fast! Like 
jets on a strafing run. He glanced 
in a mirror. The third IBM was 
working up with no more effort 
than a hot car in truck traffic. The 
Ferrari lurched and water roared 
underneath. There were pools on 
the pavement, invisible in the rain. 
A Ford sizzled past with a dark red 
Apache in its wake. Some old warn- 
ing made him slow and pull far 
right without really knowing why, 



and there it was. Spray exploded 
under the Ford’s nose and it dis- 
appeared for a second. The Apache 
dove into the wall of water then 
slashed across in front of him, spin- 
ning. The Ford plowed end for end 
into the infield. 

An old hack-chant chuckled in 
his ear: There are cool drivers and 
fool drivers, but not cool, fool driv- 
ers. 

The third IBM snarled alongside. 

Warren Corners were suddenly 
there and he was outside and out of 
position and out of luck. He noviced 
through the first hard left in a long 
slide behind the IBM. Too long. No 
chance for the right unless he backed 
through it. Damn. He dropped two 
gears and managed to leave the 
pavement in a straight line, barely 
clearing way for a Porsche and two 
big Hondas. 

The Ferrari bucked as it hit the 
dirt. He coaxed it around, carving 
long furrows in the grass and mud. 
He took out two bushes and a young 
tree, missed a rock and the fence, 
plowed through a shallow ditch and 
angled back to the course. Like 
trying to enter a freeway at five 
o’clock. He kept it rolling, edged 
into a clear spot and savagely worked 
his way up through the gears. 

Well, you old fool, he scathed 
himself, what are you doing out 
here? Forgot how to play Follow- 
the-Leader? 

Apparently, but then he had al- 
ways been the leader before. Then 
he smiled: I wonder how that looked 
on Ken’s screen? 

A Lafitte passed, chased by a 
Coventry and a Lotus. And he was 



76 



IF 




glad he was in a closed coupe. A 
game of “no touch tag” in a hurri- 
cane at 170 mph. How the devil 
could they see? He was having 
trouble enough, and their eye tubes 
were certainly no better than his 
eyes. The Lafitte pulled over in front 
of him and the Coventry passed it. 
Barely. In a crash of water, the 
Lafitte surged sideways and nudged 
the Lotus, and all he could see for 
a moment were headlights — tail- 
lights — headlights — taillights — 
two cars like pinwheels on the road 
in front, spinning together and parts 
flying, and he was suddenly through 
between them. An Abarth behind 
him didn’t make it. 

He followed the Coventry’s line 
around the Little Hairpin, let a 
Volga by, then tailed it down the 
short straight and around the Big 
Hairpin. A Honda crowded close 
behind him going into the Esses. It 
stayed there, then pulled by on the 
straight. 

No fighting it. The old Ferrari 
was outclassed. Probably the small- 
est car here could fan him on the 
straights. 

T he Honda swerved ahead of him 
and he barely missed the Apa- 
che that was swung backwards on 
the pavement, then watched help- 
lessly as the Honda rocketed head- 
on into a Ford that was re-entering 
the course. He went under some of 
that. 

He tried to relax, remembering 
that no one was being killed and 
mangled. But old habits die hard. 
To him, cars meant men. 

South Turn curved underneath 



and opened into the pit straight. 
One lap down; ninety-nine to go. 

He relaxed a little. Let them traf- 
fic each other. He was out here in 
his car and that was all that mat- 
tered. It would be the last time in 
his life that anything mattered. Let 
the machines fight it out. Let the 
servos sweat . , Too bad they 
couldn’t. 

The laps leafed away like pages 
of an old book. Long-forgotten 
things returned; the old reactions 
and techniques, once automatic, 
found themselves again. Like single 
instruments finding their place in 
an orchestral arrangement. He and 
his car were linking together again, 
slowly — then stronger, as two peo- 
ple from old passion find them- 
selves again: little by little, gradu- 
ally responding. Reacting together. 

The rain had blown away, but the 
sky sulked gray and soggy. The 
course was still wet. It wasn’t glas- 
sy; the Little Hairpin was the only 
dodgey spot where water pooled in 
the apex of the corner. Gray had 
propped a gas can up behind the 
barrier so that it could only be 
seen from the course. He had even 
found some chalk — God only 
knew from where. Ross wondered 
if he hadn’t been keeping it for 
just this moment. And the writing 
on the can read: 19? 

Well, why not. Nineteenth was a 
comfortable position. Especially for 
two Old Bastards running more on 
anger than anything else. 

But he started edging up his lap 
times. 

Traffic had thinned and scattered. 
The opening bash, like something 



THE ULTIMATE RACER

from an old, wildcat stock-car cir- 
cus, had taken care of the rash 
operators. 

It was easy, he thought, to be 
rash at some quiet console. So you 
lost a car once in a while. So what? 
All you had to lose was your job — 
not your life. There should be a 
feature of the consoles that when 
an operator bent a car — two met 
ciless metal hands seized and broke 
the operator accordingly. Perhaps 
some flavor would return. But then 
the international committees would 
ponder this danger, judge it harm- 
ful and rule that servos must operate 
the boards. Mustn't let anyone be 
hurt. Naughty. Father knows best, 
you know. Mustn't do anything 
dangerous. Ross clamped his jaws 
and slashed through the Esses us- 
ing every available inch of pave- 
ment. He was beginning to under- 
stand why the mountain climbers 
kept jumping their servos off the 
highest cliffs. 

Our Father, who knows best, you 
are a doddering old meddler! 

Modern racing or not, the old 
troubles were still there. The price 
of pushing machinery to its peak. 
There were nine cars in the pits 
with mechanics shouldered into en- 
gines. gearboxes, front ends, brakes; 
electricians into servos and consoles; 
some cars alone and lonely — dead. 
On the course he had passed a Volga 
with crumpled nose and a bad prob- 
lem with left corners. The course 
itself was sidelined with cars in var- 
ious stages of disassembly. 

And he had the unique pleasure 
of seeing a servo psych out. A 
sleek Coventry had headed him into 



the Dogleg. Something had failed 
to dick, or had clicked too many 
times, or had clicked at the wrong 
time, or had been the wrong click 
altogether, and the machine had bolt- 
ed from the course like a sudden 
coward, accelerating, spinning mud 
roostertails behind it. Fortunately 
for the spectators there was an old 
foundation there. Unfortunately for 
the Coventry. 

And he and the old warrior Fer- 
rari had gone around and around, 
and growled and howled, and .re- 
membered what it was to be alive. 

Ross Eliot is back, he grinned to 
himself. As much of him as will 
ever make it! 

A nother shower was ghosting in 
from the west. He noticed it as 
he moaned down the backstretch, 
taking Warren Corners in two linked 
arcs and nearly running over a La- 
fitte coming out. 

It tried hard to repass, but the 
Little Hairpin came up too soon. 
He sliced through the edge of the 
pool and pushed hard for the Big 
Hairpin. There was a glint of green 
ahead. He showed a cold smile and 
slammed through the Big Hairpin, 
the Esses and the .South Turn. The 
green Lotus was ahead on the pit 
straight, running behind a Porsche. 
And the Lafitte was no longer on 
his tail. 

He watched the shower barely 
touch the north end of the course 
as he came up the straight and into 
Corner One. He closed up on the 
Porsche and the Lotus coming under 
the Pirelli Bridge, and backed off 
for the Dogleg. The others didn’t. 



n 



IF 



Too bad. he grinned. Tbe two 
cars fishtailed on the slick pave- 
ment. too fast and too far into the 
corner. Didn’t your brilliant little 
lenses see that shower? 

The Lotus left the corner side- 
ways, blasted mud and destroyed it- 
self around a tree. The Porsche 
held, but broadside and sliding. He 
passed it, torque up and a gear 
over. 

He smiled his way around. Not 
too bad for an old man. Perhaps 
not too old for a bad man. 

He drove harder, deeper into the 
corners, and felt the old elation of 
pushing into that dark land of limit- 
ations. Riding the edge, they used 
to call it. It was exploring. Crowd- 
ing man and machine into that fog- 
gy unknown where only skill and 
judgment kept them alive, where 
there was no such thing as a small 
mistake. 

Racing . 1 

But I’m slow, he thought, much 
too slow. In the old days the team 
manager would have yanked him 
off the course and given him hell 
for lugging the engine. 

Gray had the pit stop signal up as 
he came past the pits. He nodded 
automatically, then laughed at him- 
self. Servos didn’t nod! They may 
short out and smoke; they got jolted 
around in a fender bending contest; 
they sometimes whirled aloft in a 
sprawl of limbs and wires in an 
accident — but nod? 

Never! 

Well — hardly ever. 

He pulled over for the pit lane 
on the next lap. braked, geared down 
and stopped by Gray. And froze. 



Stewart and Crandall were stand- ,' 
ing by the bus just behind the bar-! 
rier. Stewart was smiling! Crandall 
was frowning. 

Ken slammed from the bus, jar- 
red Stewart with a hard shoulder and 
vaulted the barrier. He started on a 
rear wheel while Gray dumped fuel 
into the five-inch filler. The car 
lurched on the jack. Ross stared 
straight ahead, hands clamped on 
the wheel. He heard Stewart laugh. 

“Well, why shouldn’t it look like 
him? I have a servo that looks like 
me — though I think mine is in 
better shape.” 

Crandall said something that was 
covered by a passing car. Stewart 
laughed again. 

“Oh, some antiques are quite as- 
tonishing, aren’t they? But it’s pathe- 
tic when they’re pressed into some- 
thing beyond their usefulness.” 

His voice seemed uncommonly 
loud, as if he were deliberately try- 
ing to reach Ross’s ears. Gray 
blocked off the two men and fum- 
bled inside the cockpit, checking 
Ross’s “connections.” 

“Looks like we sneaked out on 
the wife and got caught,” he said 
in a low voice. 

“Crandall?” 

“Crandall doesn’t know his be- 
hind from a brake disc. It’s Stewart. 
He lounged in here with his cat- 
curling grin and asked where you 
were. I told him you were suddenly 
taken ill. He said, ‘He certainly has, 
hasn’t he?’ He must have spread it 
around. The other pits are watching 
you.” 

“No black flag yet.” 

“No one will tattle but Stewart, , 



80 



IF 



I’m sure of that. But I think he’s 
waiting for you to bash it.” 

“Nice of him.” 

“He said he always wondered 
what was the color of your blood.” 



T he car jarred down from the 
jack and Ken was back over 
the barrier and into the bus. Gray 
stepped back, still blocking the two 
men. 

Ross fired the Ferrari into life 
and slammed it down the pit lane 
and onto the course. He hurled it 
through Corner One, down the short 
straight and through Comer Two. 
It squalled, held, and he screamed 
under Pirelli Bridge. 

So that was the game now! They 
had given him the stage for one 
last laugh, had they? 

He slashed through the Dogleg 
from outside to inside to outside on 
the bare brink of a wild slide and 
allowed himself a grim smile. That 
was a little better! The fire was 
back in the blaze again; Angry 
Man Eliot! 

That was what made him before: 
anger. A happy man couldn’t be a 
racer. A happy man was a satisfied 
man, and a satisfied man had no 
business out here. He had been sat- 
isfied just to be in his car on the 
course — and that was wrong for 
him. Out of character. All angry 
men managed a last, loud word. 
Perhaps his wouldn’t be the last 
word, but it would damn well be 
loud. 

The old Ferrari voiced its battle 
cry down the back straight and 



through Warren Corners. The Little 
Hairpin with its pool of water, the 
Big Hairpin, the Esses unwound be- 
neath him. He caught a Coventry 
in the South Turn, nipped inside 
and passed it coming out. It re- 
passed on the pit straight and he 
had to do it all over again in Corner 
One. It stayed back, waiting, but he 
got around a Volga in Corner Two 
and stayed there, adding a little 
more distance in the Dogleg. The 
two of them came close on his 
tail down the long back straight but 
Warren Corners rushed up and he 
had a hundred yards lead coming 
out. 

Too bad, he told them. If you had 
been men I would have waved. 

The laps raged by. He was a 
zombilike thing, a reactor to com- 
mands that bypassed thought: one 
hand on the wheel, the other on the 
shift lever, watching a corner rush 
at him at 182 mph; then brakes, 
downshift, downshift, on the line 
from one edge of the pavement to 
the other to the outside again, full 
pedal, upshift, tach into the red 
line, upshift, wait for the next 
corner. I’m a servo, he thought. 
Little different from the others; just 
blood instead of electricity. Have 
you seen the color yet, Stewart? 

Faces flashed and followed from 
the pits. Take a good look, he told 
them. It’s the last act and you may 
miss the whole damn point of the 
play. 

He caught a Porsche in the Esses, 
a Lotus on Corner Two, and an 
Apache in the Dogleg. A Lotus 
wouldn’t let him by in Warren 
Corners nor in the Little Hairpin. 



THE ULTIMATE RACER 



81 




In the Big Hairpin he planted the 
Ferrari’s nose on its tail and pushed. 
It pulled over. Clear off the pave- 
ment. A Honda was next in the 
South Turn, then another Porsche 
on Corner Two. 

And that is your failing, fellows, 
he grinned. Corners. 

The bland servos didn’t have that 
one critical sense: that delicate, sub- 
liminal thing that heard the whisper 
in the car and reacted before the 
mind gave it reason; that intimate 
thing that linked a man and ma- 
chine. It was something that couldn’t 
ride a wavelength. 

And races are run in the corners, 
he told them, not on the straights. 
Any child can fire a missile in a 
straight line, but a man learns to 
corner. 

And not just on a race course, 
either. 

C ars were passed and fell behind, 
and fatigue slipped into his 
arms and shoulders. Blood and mus- 
cles, he thought, aren’t electricity 
and solenoids. 

Gray was alone again in the pit 
and his makeshift board showed po- 
sition and remaining laps. But it 
made little difference. He had been 
lapped once by the leaders, the 
IBM’s and two Lotus. It wasn’t a 
matter of winning now; it was a 
matter of doing what he could. 
Didn’t they used to say that the true 
drivers were really racing them- 
selves? Something like that. Stirling 
Moss once put it another way. 
One’s a racer or one’s not. 

And one’s a man or one’s not. 

He pushed. And finally glimpsed 



them flying the Esses like three 
white rockets: the ultimate racers 
by GM out of IBM; numbers 1, 2, 
and 3. And that’s the way they 
planned to finish, with the two 
green Lotus howling at their heels. 

He smiled. Stewart must be ques- 
tioning himself to death. Not only 
was Old Angry Man running with 
the hounds but his trim green streaks 
were being shown the way home. 
Poor man. We may as well combine 
his problems. One’s a racer or one’s 
not. 

He chased, pushing to the ragged 
rim, and the flashes of white and 
green ahead of him came more fre- 
quently. 

He edged closer lap by lap and 
was finally last in the trainlike line 
that screamed out of the South 
Turn and past the blurred faces in 
the pits. White, green and red! 

Symbolic? he thought. Yes. White 
is Truth. Green is Jealousy. Red is 
— what else? — Blood. 

It all fit nicely. The IBM’s were 
the next step; logical advancement. 
Yes, take a good lock, people. Ten 
years of racing in one tricolored 
flash. 

They hauled away from him on 
the straights; he caught them in the 
corners. They pulled away, and he 
caught them again. He studied them 
and frowned. 

The IBM’s were good. Too good. 
Almost manlike. Their reactions in 
the corners were incredibly fast, 
faster than any man, but they still 
had a reservation and he was cor- 
nering faster. But the IBM’s had 
an assurance, a confidence — damn 
it — almost a sense- They were cor- 



82 



IF 




nering better than the two Lotus. 
And he gave himself a bitter grin. 
The operator — human or not — 
belongs in the machine. These two 
creations were almost racers. Al- 
most. The test was — were they 
capable of pushing beyond them- 
selves? Did they know their own 
boundaries? 

The five cars lengthened their 
lead down the back straight, but 
Warren Corners came zigzagging 
and he pushed his red nose to with- 
in six inches of the last green tail. 
The Lotus pulled over for him to 
pass but he did not have the power. 
He dropped behind it again, then 
slammed deep into the Little Hair- 
pin. They came out side by side. 
It outpulled him on the short 
straight. He did it again on the Big 
Hairpin, holding his foot down to 
the last possible instant. He came 
out in front of the Lotus and with 
enough speed over to pull along- 
side its twin. It matched him how- 
ever and they went into the Esses 
side by side. Then came the South 
Turn, and this time down the pit 
it was white, red, green. 

Well, Stewart? Have you seen the 
color yet? 

T he two Lotus came after him 
like cats on a rabbit but he 
stayed ahead through the north end 
of the course; the fast half, but 
with enough corners to hold them 
back. 

He arced through the Dogleg on 
the crying edge of a slide, trying to 
carry enough speed through with 
him to hold down the long back 
straight. For a moment he held 



steady behind the three white IBM’s, 
but had to watch them pull away, 
and frown helplessly at his mirrors 
as the two Lotus closed the distance 
behind him. One started by, but 
Warren Corners were almost always 
a wit surprising. They hid in ambush 
over a slight rise, and at 187 mph 
they sprang suddenly. Too suddenly 
for the console operator in the Lotus 
van. 

The green car slammed full panic 
brakes, slithering beside him, then 
swung broadside as it fell behind. 
The other Lotus had to leave the 
course to avoid a crash, but man - , 
aged to stay on its wheels. 

Well, Stewart, that’s the bitch of 
it, isn’t it? A car is still only as 
good as its operator. 

He howled through the two War- 
rens and came up close behind the 
last IBM; number three. It sprinted 
up beside two as if goosed. 

So, he nodded. You can go fast- 
er, can you? And you’re just a bit 
spooky too. 

Well . 

They backed off for the Little 
Hairpin, three dropping back to find 
its line. But Ross held. The distance 
rushed shut until he knew some- 
thing beyond his own brakes would 
have to save them from collision. 
Stampeding, they used to call it; 
for scaring green drivers. And three 
was green. It spurted up beside two 
again on the inside, and the corner 
was there and the pool of water and 
no place for it to go. 

Spray crashed white against the 
sky. The car recovered instantly, 
but in that slice of time it touched 
two. And two left the corner side-

ways into the mud, going over and 
ever and into the air and end for 
end until there was hardly enough of 
it left to stop. 

Number three stayed on the 
course, but greatly slowed, and he, 
passed it without losing speed. He 
tried to pick up the slipstream from 
one. but he was not close enough 
hard into the Big Hairpin, caught 
the IBM coming out, and hung on 
through the Esses. He rode close 
and felt them touch lightly in the 
South Turn. 

The IBM turned full power past 
0 the stands and pits, but bis slip- 
streaming held and they entered 
Corner One less than a foot anart. 
In the one flashing glance he had. 
it seemed that he had never seen 
so many faces bordering around the 
course^ 

And he hated them! Hated them 
with a savage, flaming hatred for 
their coddled, cowardly world; their 
progressively protective world that 
had made him an alien in his own 
land. For he was an alien and he 
knew it now. An anachronism. A 
smoldering old savage unable to 
adapt; unable to take it quietly. 

An Old Bastard. 

The number three IBM was clos- 
ing on him down the pit straight 
and through Corner One with the 
remaining Lotus snarling on its tail. 
They were closer coming out of 
Corner Two, snaking slightly in 
their screaming acceleration. He al- 
lowed himself a small smile. So that 
was the flavor now: full go and to 
hell with the cars! 

Okay. 

Men have a full go too. 



T he IBM seemed about to run 
over him going under the 
bridge, finally coming alongside, the 
Lotus riding its slipstream. 

There was no passing room before 
the Dogleg; it was back off or get 
off. He knew what was coming. It 
was an old trick, and he felt dis- 
gust that they should think he 
couldn’t handle it. He was on the 
outside, holding into the corner un- 
til they had no room to come over 
to make their line. Then he gave 
full brakes, dropped a gear, then 
another, then full power. 

The two cars drifted across his 
nose, forced too far into the cor- 
ner. He cleared the tail of the 
Lotus by four inches, stayed on his 
line and went through. They left the 
pavement. The IBM hit a shallow 
ditch and bounced. The Lotus 
swerved to miss it and hit a parked 
Lafitte. Dirt and pieces cluttered up 
the sky. He had one last glimpse of 
the IBM fishtailing through the 
grass, trying to recover, then it fell 
behind. 

He chased hard down the back 
straight, out of the slipstream now 
and losing distance. Damned stupid 
machines! But his mirrors showed 
three back on the course and com- 
ing fast, tire smoke streaming behind 
it. He caught one again out of War- 
ren Corners. He held back a short 
distance, then made a bid in the 
Little Hairpin. They held side by 
side for a moment coming out, en- 
gines climbing to a siren cry. But 
power paid again and he had to 
tuck in behind the white car as it 
pulled away. Number three was 
pressing closer through the Big 



84 



IF 




Hairpin. He could see why. It carv- 
ed out behind him in a brawling, 
tire-mauling disregard for every- 
thing, only its brute power holding 
it on the course. Its engine couldn’t 
take that for long, he knew that. But 
apparently that made no difference 
now. It was after him. By design or 
by mistake, by will or by short cir- 
cuit, it was after him. 

Couldn’t they turn it off? Or 
didn’t they want to? 

If you were a man, he thought, 
if you were a being of choice and 
knowledge — I would admire you. 
You would be a racer. 

T hey seethed through the Esses 
and lined up for the South 
Turn. Three was coming now like 
a mad beast. He held close inside 
in the fast left turn. Three started 
around him on the outside. Im- 
possible! Nothing could hold at that 
speed. 

“Why you goddamned machine!” 
he said. “You’re broken!” 

The IBM sheered wide and lean- 
ed into the wall. Body panels shat- 
tered off behind it. A tire blew. 
It lurched, slammed the wall hard 
and curved across in front of him. 
He jabbed brakes and dropped a 
gear. The Ferrari screamed its pro- 
test, sending the tachometer far be- 
yond the red line. 

“Sorry, old girl, but I think they’ve 
taken us.” 

He could drop back until the tan- 
gle resolved itself. But one would 
be down the straight and out of 
sight. Or he could hold in and bore 
through and never quite know how 
he made it. The decision was made 



without him really aware of the 
question. One’s a racer or one’s not. 

The wild three barely cleared his 
nose — and slashed into two. 

They both spun. He backed off, 
watching. That was it! The metal 
men had bashed themselves out. The 
apple was his now. The whole show! 
He could stroll home and take it. 
The two cars separated, ricocheting 
from the wall. He watched, safely, 
then rammed his foot down. There 
would be a hole! A tiny hole and 
the old Ferrari would lose some 
more paint. But that’s the going of 
it. He had never strolled home! 

But something white blurred across 
in front of him, he met it full on. 

The shoulder strap snapped and 
his head smashed the wheel. Auto- 
matically he yanked himself back 
and pulled hard left, trying to broad- 
slide down the straight. But the 
slide became a spin, and he was 
too dazed and too tired and too old 
to do anything about it. 

Go, Ferrari, he said. You’ve got 
eleven years of momentum in you. 
Work it off. You’ve got the last 
word. 

Another crash. And another. 

And one final thundering impact 
that blasted him to a halt. The 
engine roared into him through the 
firewall. Flames exploded in the 
cockpit that he did not feel and the 
only thing he heard from the world 
outside was one voice — almost a 
scream. 

" Let it burn!” 

He agreed. The only thing to do. 

He groped until he found the 
wheel, then leaned back in the seat 
and smiled. END

IF • Short Story 






BY L. J. STECHER, JR. 



Here's why the captain of the 

Delta Crucis couldn't lie — 
and what he could do instead! 



I can’t say that I enjoy dealing 
with Captain Hannah. 

It isn’t that he charges too much 
for the use of that tramp spacer of 
his — the Delta Crucis — although 
he usually isn’t above charging close 
to the limit of what he figures the 
traffic will bear. It’s just that things 
seem to happen whenever 1 dead 
with him. And then there’s the point 
that I don’t trust him. 

Still, he sometimes gives me a 
better price than I can get anywhere 
else, and on occasion his is the 
only ship that’s available. So I find 
myself contracting with him often- 
er than is good for my health. 



Captain Hannah usually isn’t 
much given to talking, but on this 
occasion I was giving him a hard 
time. The prospective cargo was 
milna nuts. As you know, they are 
easy to ship, and can be stored for 
years. The only thing that bothers 
them is dampness. If I couldn’t get 
my price, I could afford to wait. 
The warehouse they were stored in 
was mine, it was well built and it 
wasn’t full. As for Captain Han- 
nah, I think that an installment on 
the mortgage on Delta Crucis must 
have been due. He was acting hun- 
gry- 

At any rate, he had been tell- 



86 




ing me about the unusually excel- 
lent humidity control system he had 
in his ship. When I delicately implied 
that he was shading the truth, he 
didn’t stare at me silently out of 
those pale spacer’s eyes of his and 
then stalk away, as he usually would 
have done. Instead, when he had 
stared at me silently, he beckoned 
the waiter over and motioned for 
our glasses to be refilled. 

T hen the silent Captain Hannah 
started to talk. 

“Clever I may not be,” said Cap- 
tain Hannah. “Lucky I frequently 
am not. But dishonest — this I will 
never be.” 

He paused. “I have never told 
anyone this before, but would you 
like to hear about how I came to 
own Delta Crucis? It will prove my 
statement about my honesty, and 
that will give you a hold over me 
in future dealings that I’m not sure 
I can afford. Still, it will be worth 
it, if it helps me get this contract 
with you at this time.” 

“I told him expansively that I 
was in no hurry, that my crop and 
I were very happy where they were, 
but that if he wanted to tell me a 
story, I was not adverse to drinking 
his liquor. 

“Well,” said Captain Hannah, 
“not too many years ago I was 
First Officer of the Star of Glory. 
That’s one of the biggest and 
most profitable combined passenger- 
freighters of the Glory Line. You’ve 
heard of them, I’m sure, even if 
their ships don’t often call at back- 
water planets like this one. They 
are a huge outfit, but they aren’t 



particularly famous for their hon- 
esty. The courts keep them from 
getting too far out of line very often, 
but they shave things as close as 
they think they can get away with. 

“At the time of my story, we 
were circling Gamma Ophiuchus 
Four, getting ready to set down and 
do a little trading. Captain Clark 
was a big, bold man, with the kind 
of moral sense, or lack of it, that 
the Glory Line admires. But when 
he gathered his crew together to 
give last minute instructions he look- 
ed scared. His big, blotchy face had 
turned mushroom pale and glistened 
with a sheen of sweat. His hands 
trembled as he held them up in his 
usually brusque signal for silence. 

“ ‘Listen to me, all of you,’ he 
said hoarsely. ‘Behave yourselves 
dirtside this trip. No tricks, no steal- 
ing, no lies. Not on the Diogenes 
Planet. For the sake of all of us, 
keep your noses entirely clean. If 
you make one step out of line 
they’ll know it, God help us. And 
I’ll know it. And you’ll regret it 
the rest of your lives — if you’re 
allowed to live.’ 

“He paused for a minute and ran 
a hand over his clammy face. When 
he continued, it seemed almost as 
if he talked to himself instead of 
his crew. ‘After what the Empress of 
Glory pulled here last year it may 
be too late for all of us, whatever 
we do. But the Company says we 
go down, so we go down. They 
say it’s worth the risk — but what 
do they risk? Still, it may be all 
right . Just remember: don’t lie 
or steal on this planet.’ 

“Captain Clark visibly pulled 



THE DIOGENES PLANET

himself back together, and then 
yelled out, ‘That’s all — man your 
landing station' 

tCVTow, I had been friends with 
a couple of the officers in 
the old Empress. I knew that her 
entire crew — including officers — 
had been paid off and replaced 
after they had got back from their 
previous cruise. The rumor was 
that they had been blackballed from 
space, but no one from Empress 
would talk about it. I hadn’t known 
that they had set down on Gamma 
Ophiuchus Four. Between the mys- 
tery of what happened to the crew 
Of the Empress and the mystery of 
a fearless skipper acting gutless- 
scared, I decided it wouldn’t do me 
any harm to behave myself and tell 
the truth for a few days. In fact it 
might do a lot of good. At that 
time, however, it was certainly not 
my intention to make honesty a 
way of life. For a spacer like him- 
self, it sounded too much like a 
way of life that didn’t go along with 
eating regularly. And I’m fond of 
my three squares a day — it’s a 
habit I acquired a long time ago. 

“So the captain set the Star of 
Glory down into her berth as 
smoothly as if he hadn’t had his 
teeth chattering. After the cooling 
sprays cut off, I rode the ladder 
down as head of the landing detail. 
As I told you, Glory was a big ship, 
but she wasn’t that big; the skipper, 
not the first officer, was the usual 
head of the landing detail. The 
switch didn’t make me feel any 
better. 

“Well, I 'howdied the senior na- 



tive of the group that rode out to 
meet us, just as if everything was 
sweetness and light. He nodded 
back gravely. He, like the rest of 
his party, was about seven feet 
tall, with a bald head about two 
sizes too big for the rest of him. The 
boss, whose name I can’t pronounce, 
had pepper and salt body fur, care- 
fully curried wherever it showed on 
his arms and legs and under his 
casually slung toga. He strode 
around with a sort of stately awk- 
wardness, like a stork, and like the 
others he had sleepy, heavy-lidded 
eyes. Frankly, they didn’t look like 
much to be worried about. But I 
was worried about them. 

“The headman held out a long 
arm without saying anything. I laid 
our port authorization and our pra- 
tique and manifests and such in it. 
He perused them all in a languid 
and leisurely manner, and then ask- 
ed, in excellent Trade English, if 
our ship didn’t belong to the same 
Company as the Empress of Glory. 

“I told him yes. He sighed and 
studied the faces of all of the men 
in the landing detail with great care. 
Then he nodded slowly and asked 
to see the rest of the crew. As these 
men came down the ladder he gave 
each of them the same slow face- 
to-face stare, but he seemed satisfied 
until, last of all, the captain showed 
up. 

“The Ophiucan’s bald head slow- 
ly turned a deep purple, and then 
faded gradually back to its normal 
light blue. He didn’t speak until the 
reversible color change was com- 
plete. Then, regretfully I thought, 
he said, ‘You, Captain Clark, have

IF 




visited us before. At that time your 
behavior gave us concern. Now, 
since the visit of the Empress of 
Glory, your own return leaves us 
no choice. You, and all of your 
crew, must be given Stage Two Edu- 
cation. 

6 <TT without hesitation, as if he’d 
» * been held down on springs 
and released by a trigger. Captain 
Clark dove for the ladder and 
swarmed up it, trying desperately to 
escape back into the interior of his 
ship. 

“The rest of us just stood with 
our jaws slightly dropped, watching 
the performance. The Ophiucans, 
though, for all of their awkward- 
ness, moved as quickly as the Cap- 
tain did. One of them caught him 
by the heels just before he disappear- 
ed entirely from view. They haul- 
ed him, still scrabbling, back down 
the ladder. 

“ ‘Don’t let them take us!’ he 
screamed. ‘Help me! Help me! ’ At 
that, a few of us tried a sally to 
free Captain Clark and break 
through into the ship, but the na- 
tives were ready for that, too. They 
rounded all of us up, and held us 
with a casual air of complete bore- 
dom that was infuriating. 

“Their boss took no notice of all 
of this. He just led the way slowly 
back to the column of Ophiucan 
vehicles, and jacknifed into the first 
one. We Earthmen were herded into 
the trucks behind, and wheeled to a 
windowless building at the edge of 
the landing area. There we were 
led into a long, featureless corridor 
lined on both sides with doors and 



were popped, one to a room, into 
the torture cubicles behind the doors. 

“They were entirely impersonal 
and dispassionate about the whole 
thing. They strapped me into a 
chair, the only one in the room, and 
got right to work. They hit me with 
needles that sent fire and ice 
through my body. They wheeled up 
a machine that blinked agonizing 
lights and howled agonizing sounds 
at me for days and months — for 
and eternity of time. And through 
it all, and it was the most unen- 
durable thing of all, a calm voice 
spoke to me continuously, pounding 
at my brain until it broke into lit- 
tle pieces. Actually, I’ve found out 
since, the whole thing didn’t take 
more than a couple of hours. 

“I’ve only been given a dose of 
the rack or thumbscrews once, but I 
can bet that the best experts with 
those tools are amateurs in compari- 
son with the Ophiucans when it 
comes to dishing out pain. Only 
what they had done didn’t show 
when they were finished. After- 
wards, when they let me go, I could 
walk without a limp. There wasn’t 
so much as a red mark on me. 

“They turned all of us loose — 
just like that. They even apologized 
for the discomfort that they felt 
they had caused us, and set up a 
trade meeting for the following day. 
None of us headed back for the 
ship, except the captain. The crew 
headed for a pub that was pointed 
out by an Ophiucan, and I turned 
into the Officer’s Bar. 

“It was all very normal and cus- 
tomary for a spaceship’s crew after 
planetfall, except for that intermin-

able two hours of torture just be- 
hind me. I tell you, 1 resolved to 
behave myself on Gamma Ophiuch- 
us Four.” Captain Hannah paused 
to take a sip of his drink. 

t (Tt’s a very sad story,” I told 

JL Captain Hannah. “And may- 
be l even believe it. But I under- 
stand that people forget the lessons 
taught them by pain very quickly. 
And after all, this isn’t Gamma 
Ophiuchus Four. Why should all 
of this that you’ve told me give me 
confidence in your present veraci- 
ty?” 

Captain Hannah stared at me for 
several seconds, and then very 
slowly set down his glass. Didn’t 
you hear me when I started?” he 
asked. “This is the story of how I 
got Delta Crucis. Wait until you 
hear the rest. 

“There was only one other Earth- 
man in the bar,” said Captain Han- 
nah. “He waited until I had a drink 
in front of me, and then wandered 
over to my table. ‘Do you mind?’ he 
asked, motioning to a chair beside 
mine. 

“I shrugged, and he sat down. 
‘I’m Captain Jones,’ he said. ‘May- 
be you saw my ship when you set 
down. Mine is Delta Crucis, over 
there on the other side of the 
field.’ 

“I said nothing, and he looked 
at me for a very long time. ‘So 
they gave you the Cure?’ he asked 
softly, as last. 

“I nodded. ‘The bastards.’ 

“Jones shook his head. ‘You’ve 
got them all wrong,’ he said. ‘In 
their own minds, they were doing 



you a favor. They weren’t torturing 
you. They weren’t trying to hurt 
you at all. What they were doing 
was treating your sick mind. Un- 
fortunately, they don’t know much 
about human metabolism and such, 
so the treatment hurts.’ 

“I nodded in agreement. 

“ ‘They are the best mind-tinker* 
ers that I’ve ever heard of in the 
Universe. And they are a very moral 
people. They can’t stand liars. Also, 
and not very surprisingly, they hate 
to be cheated. You — or your 
outfit at least — must have tried 
to put something over on them at 
some time or other. They let that 
happen only once, if they’re care- 
less.’ 

“I nodded. ‘It’s possible,’ I agreed. 
With the Glory Line, it was so pos- 
sible as to be a certainty. 

“ ‘What they did to you,’ said 
Captain Jones, ‘was to treat your 
mind so that it is now impossible for 
you to tell a lie. Also, they have 
fixed it so that if you have stolen 
anything of theirs, or of anybody 
else’s on this world, you can’t take 
it off-planet with you when you 
leave. Nor can you knowingly lift 
off with anything that anyone else 
has stolen on board your ship. That’s 
what they refer to as Stage Two 
Education. They figure that treat- 
ment will put an end to lying and 
stealing on this planet. They never 
lie or steal themselves.’ 

“ ‘It sounds mighty effective, too, 
if you’re telling the truth,’ I said. 

“ ‘Oh, I can prove that it’s the 
truth, easily enough,’ said Captain 
Jones. ‘Just you try to tell me a 
lie — any lie at all.’ 



90 



IF 




tCXTrell, I tried, and I couldn’t 
V V do it. I couldn’t force my- 
self to tell a lie, no matter how 
much I sweated and tried. Jt was 
hell. I was horrified. What good is 
a trader in the spaceways who has 
to tell the truth all the time, even 
when he dickers? 

“Captain Jones tried to console 
me. We had several drinks, which 
we paid for alternately, and he said 
that maybe it wouldn’t be too bad 
for me after all — that Earthmen 
are a mighty ingenious bunch of 
people, all in all, and that in an 
emergency, they might even be able 
to tell the truth and make out all 
right with a small profit at the end. 

“Well, when it came time for the 
Ophiucan bartender to shut up shop, 
my friend Captain Jones asked if 
I had any spare money. ‘We can go 
over to my ship,’ he said, ‘and play 
a little poker. After all, it’s perfect- 
ly safe. I know I can trust you to 
be honest with the cards.’ 

“This sounded fine and fair to 
me at the time. In my condition it 
somehow never occurred to me that 
I had no equivalent assurance as to 
the honesty of Captain Jones. I’ve 
got three thousand, about,’ I told 
him, patting my pocket. ‘Got it right 
here. Don’t mind too much losing 
in an honest game — hate to be 
cheated. Like an Ophi — Ophu — ’ 
I let that idea lie where it belonged, 
and let Captain Jones lead me 
around the edges of the sprawling 
spaceport, to where his ship stood 
in an isolated launching bay. The 
ship wasn’t new and it wasn’t big — 
you know the Delta class almost as 
well as I do — but it looked beauti- 



ful to me. You know, you’ve hired 
my ship often enough: one-man 
controls, and freedom of action, in- 
stead of the large crews and the 
steady schedules and the compli- 
cated regulations and the demand- 
ing passengers of a Glory Liner. 

“We climbed up into the control 
room. Captain Jones broke out a 
bottle, but the walk had sobered me 
enough that I turned him down. 
‘Look,’ I asked. ‘How can I play 
poker with you? I’ve got to tell the 
truth all the time.’ 

“ ‘Of course,’ he answered. ‘You 
weren’t intending to cheat, were you? 
When you pull a bluff and make a 
bet on a bad hand, you aren’t lying. 
You are just saying that you are 
willing to bet that much money on 
that hand; and with your cash in the 
pot, you are sure telling the truth. I 
just don’t have to worry about 
cheating, that’s all. Of course, you 
won’t be able to look happy when 
you’ve got a bad hand, or pretend 
that you don’t know the correct 
odds, or pull any shady plays like 
that. But then, you don’t look to 
me like a man who would try to 
play that brand of poker, with or 
without the Ophiucan treatment.’ 

1 1 Qo I accepted his drink, and 
we started playing. 

“Captain Jones wasn’t a very 
good poker player. He knew the 
odds all right, but he bet a little 
too hard when he had a good hand, 
and there was a sort of unconscious 
twitch in his left eye when he was 
thinking of pulling a bluff. He ran 
out of money pretty soon, and start- 
ed writing I.O.U.s. We kept the

game going for several hours — it 
must have been the middle of the 
night by the time we finished — 
and when we counted up Captain 
Jones’ I.O.U.’s we figured out that 
I had just acquired a spaceship, 
complete with mortgage. 

“I felt an impulse to tell Jones 
to take back his ship, that it wasn’t 
fair for him to gamble it away in 
a single night, but I found that I 
couldn’t say it. It wouldn’t have 
been true. The game had been an 
honest one. I would have paid if I 
had lost. I did want a spaceship — 
this spaceship. Delta Crucis was 
what I had been longing for during 
all of my years in space. 

“I wouldn’t be being dishonest to 
Captain Clark or the Glory Line 
either, if I left the Star of Glory to 
skipper my own ship. I was already 
old to be a mere first officer. My 
contract had expired and not re- 
newed — they were just taking me 
back home through courtesy and a 
provision of my contract that re- 
quired them to. The second officet 
was fully qualified to take my 
place. 

“ ‘What are you going to do with 
yourself, now that you haven’t got a 
ship?’ I asked Jones. ‘Captain Clark 
might take you on as first officer, 
to keep the passengers impressed 
with the number of officers he’s got, 
but I’m not a bit sure of that. He 
carries all the Blue Suits the law 
requires, even without me.’ 

“ ‘It might be worth giving him 
a try,’ said Jones. ‘Or I may just 
have to stay here on the Diogenes 
Planet and see what develops.’ 

“He shook his head, a little sadly, 



I thought. ‘Do you know,’ he said, 
‘one of the things I’ll be sorry for 
about all this, if I stay here, is that 
I’ll miss setting down on the planet 
most of your cargo is assigned to. 
Eden Number Five. I had planned 
to take a little vacation there — 
hunting and fishing, and maybe a 
little bit more. They’ve got some 
mighty good-looking girls. 

“ ‘I’ll tell you what,’ 1 said, ‘I’ll 
take you there. There’s no reason 
that you shouldn’t stay on board. 
And you should be able to ship out 
of Eden Number Five without a bit 
of trouble. A lot of ship’s officers 
are just looking for the chance to 
stay awhile. Let’s consider that it’s 
all settled, then.’ 

‘No, thank you,’ said Jones. ‘That 
would be charity, and I’d never for- 
give myself if I took that kind of 
charity from you now. I lost fair 
and square, and I’m not whining. 
Let’s just leave it at that.’ 

t {T T 7"ell, I couldn’t persuade him 
▼ * to agree to come with 
me. He wanted to, it was clear 
enough, but he had that old spacer 
pride. I liked him a good deal 
better for showing it. It eased some 
of the contempt I had felt toward 
him for gambling away a fine ship 
like Delta Crucis. 

“ ‘At least you’ll spend the night 
here, what’s left of it,’ I said at 
last. ‘You can use your old cabin. 
I won’t be moving in until tomor- 
row anyway. Not that there’s any- 
thing on the Star that I really want 
to bring with me aboard my ship. 
Some uniforms with the wrong in- 
signia, and some other clothes.’

“ ‘I’ll take you up on that,” said 
Jones, ‘and thanks. Thanks a lot. 
I’ll take my own things dirtside 
tomorrow. 

“ ‘And don’t forget to make your 
arrangements with the Port Authori- 
ties to lift. You have to start with- 
in about three days if you’re going 
to make it to Eden Number Five 
in time, and there’s a penalty clause 
in your contract if you’re late, that 
you can’t afford to pay. It only takes 
a few minutes to get clearance, pro- 
vided you do it at night. You may 
not have had occasion to find out 
about it, but these stilt-legs are 
nocturnal. You were met by the off- 
shift. By the way, your ship is 
all topped off and ready to go.’ 
Jones ran his fingers slowly over 
the smooth enamel of the main 
computer, patted it a couple of 
times without any noticeable change 
of expression and then stumbled 
into my cabin. 

“I stayed in the control room 
for a while, thinking, and finally 
managed to reach a decision. Jones 
wanted to come with me. It was 
just his pride that was keeping him 
from riding along. He couldn’t ob- 
ject if I took off while he was still 
on board; in fact, he’d be grateful. 
I tiptoed over and locked the door 
to the cabin. Then I called up my 
old ship, and told the O.D. of the 
Star of Glory that it was up to him, 
as Officer of the Deck, to wake 
up the skipper and tell him that I 
wouldn’t be back. Morgon — the 
O.D. — told me he figured that 
could wait until morning, but that 
Captain Clark wasn’t getting much 
sleep. 



“That chore accomplished. 1 buz- 
zed the Spaceport Control Tower, 
and got clearance to lift. 

tt'\T7'ithin a couple of hours 
from the time she had be- 
come mine with the help of a busted 
flush, Delta Crucis was growling up 
into parking orbit under my com- 
mand. Jones woke up at that, of 
course, but I couldn’t hear what he 
was shouting until I cut the jets. 
And even then I couldn’t make out 
the words. All I could tell was that 
he was pounding and kicking at the 
door and yelling. Actually, I wasn’t 
trying to listen to him very hard. 
I was lining up my ship for my first 
Jump in my own property, and I 
wanted it to be a good one. 

“When I finally pushed the but- 
ton and we went into the Limbo 
that cut us entirely free from 
Ophiuchus and sent us hurtling, I 
hoped, to the vicinity of Eden, the 
banging and kicking and shouting 
stopped as if the button had cut 
them off too. 

“I went over to the door and un- 
locked it to let Jones out. I was be- 
ginning to worry that he might be 
unhappy about my having shang- 
haied him, even if I had meant it as 
a gift. 

“‘Congratulations, my friend,’ he 
said. ‘You got me off that damn 
planet, in spite of all the Ophiu- 
cans could do! You came through 
in fine style. Somehow, do you 
know, I never really believed all this 
would work. It was a real long shot 
gamble, but I had to take it.” 

“ ‘What the hell are you talking 
about?’ I asked him politely. ‘You’re 



THE DIOGENES PLANET

babbling. Have you gone off your 
rocker?’ 

“ ‘Almost,’ said Jones. ‘It was a 
close thing. But I’m fine now. I 
knew that there had to be some 
way — some honest way — to get 
around those stilt legs with their 
holier-than-thou morality and their 
brain molding. I couldn’t beat their 
conditioning, so I used it.’ 

“ ‘Then you’ve been through that 
treatment of theirs too?’ I asked. 

“ ‘I sure have,’ Jones nodded 
proudly. ‘And with reason, too, ac- 
cording to their lights. I picked up 
a handful of Ophiucan fire opals 
real cheap. The way I did it was 
honest enough to get me by most 
places, but it wasn’t honest enough 
for these natives, so they gave me 
the works. They didn’t try to take 
the stones back; they were mine, all 
right. The bastards just fixed it up 
so that they were sure I could never 
sell them or get them off the planet. 

“Remember, they have adjusted 
my mind so that I can’t lie, and so 
I can’t knowingly let the goods I 
stole be removed from the planet. So 
I had to arrange for you to do it 
without my knowledge, and that 
wasn’t easy. That’s what I was bang- 
ing on the door for — to tell you 
what I had done, so you wouldn’t 
go through with it. If you had 
heard me, you would have had to 
set Delta Crucis back down on the 
Diogenes planet. When we shifted 
into Limbo, the compulsion ceased. 

“ ‘As you can understand, that’s 
why I couldn’t accept your charity. 
You wouldn’t have locked me out of 
the control room, and I would 
have stopped you from lifting. For- 



tunately. I didn’t really believe you’d 
lock me in and take off — it was 
just a hope. If I’d been even half 
sure, I couldn’t have carried it off.’ 

“ ‘But why didn’t you just give 
me the ship? Why the gambling bit? 
And did you try to lose?’ 

( t Tones laughed. ‘Of course I 
didn’t try to lose. That 
would have been dishonest. You had 
to earn the ship to take it without 
asking questions that would have 
wrecked everything. I’d have had to 
tell you the truth, you know. If you 
will think back, you’ll realize that 
every word I told you was the abso- 
lute truth. But I’ve got my gems 
safely into space anyway, and it’s 
well worth the loss of the Crucis to 
do it. My profits will be big 
enough to let me buy a dozen ships 
like this, free and clear.’ 

“ ‘Aren’t you afraid I’ll just take 
the stones away from you?’ I asked. 

“Jones shook his head. ‘I’d raise 
a stink, and the authorities would 
ask you about it, and you’d have to 
tell them the truth. Remember, by 
Galactic Law I came by these gems 
legally, and Ophiucan rules don’t 
apply in space. 

“ ‘That’s why you can’t just drop 
me out through the space lock, eith- 
er, if you should have that in mind, 
which I doubt. You’d just talk a 
noose around your neck, sooner or 
later.’ 

“ ‘I’m satisfied,’ I said. And I 
was. I had my ship, and I still have 
it. And I manage to make a little 
profit with her, too, even though I 
have to keep absolutely honest in my 
dealings, even with crooks.”

Captain Hannah finished his 
drink. “And that, my friend, is why 
you can trust me,” he said. “The 
treatment I was given on the Dio- 
genes Planet is beyond the ability of 
anyone else in the Universe to undo, 
insofar as I’ve been able to find out 
up to this time. And I’ve tried. So, 
do I get the contract?” 

I wasn’t sure. It sounded to me as 
if the captain of a space tramp, 
even being honest, was more 
dangerous than most men are, lying 
up a storm. 

“You can read the contract as 
well as I can,” said Captain Hannah. 
“I’m insured against non-delivery, 
so you don’t have to worry about 
that. You pay me based on the 
lowest price you can expect me to 
get for milna nuts in good condition 
— you only lose if they spoil. And 
I promise to keep very careful check 
on the humidity controls — very 
careful. Remember, if your profits 
go up, so do mine. The price I’m 



quoting you is barely enough to 
cover my fuel cost and the next 
payment on the mortgage on Delta 
Crucis, which is about due.” 

S o I gave him my trade, and he 
made me a profit, too. Almost 
five times what I expected to make. 

He turned the humidity controls 
up high, so the milna nuts sprouted, 
and then sold them at premium 
prices as seedlings. It’s honest 
enough, I suppose, but it’s also very 
risky. Too damp or not quite damp 
enough, and the nuts just rot. And 
the risk was all mine. Hannah 
couldn’t lose. 

Of course, it took very careful 
attention to the humidity controls 
through the whole trip to get the 
cargo through safely, and that is 
just what he’d promised. 

Maybe Captain Hannah is forced 
to tell the truth, after all. I wonder 
if Diogenes would recognize his 
Honest Man if he saw him? END

THE DIOGENES PLANET 




IF • Novelette 



Assassin & Son 

BY THOMAS M. DISCH 



His way of life was the 
dealing of death . and 
his victims were legionl 



T he intemperate sun of Sepharad 
had half risen, its golden circle 
still skewered on the western horizon 
by the spires of the capital city of 
Zamorah. To the East, the black, 
elliptical backside of the Parasol had 
likewise risen. It stood in opposition 
to the sun, like a disc of nighttime 
that the day could not dispel. 

Joseph Goldfrank tossed off a 
brocade coverlet and stumbled out 
onto his private balcony, where an 
antique bronze quadrant was mount- 
ed on the marble balustrade. After 



consulting Barron’s Astral Tables, he 
adjusted the quadrant a fraction of 
a degree from its previous position. 
Then, kneeling, his palms lifted in 
the direction determined by the 
quadrant, he began to pray: “Terra- 
father, Gaea-mother, Earth, which I 
may never hope to tread — though 
I am absent, do not forget that I am 
yours. Yours still: in the press of 
other Gravities; in the light of other 
Suns: in the midst of Aliens: still 
yours. Preserve me human and re- 
member me so. Let my sons return 
to your land, your light, your air and 
your people.” 







While he mumbled through the 
old ritual, his mind cleared itself of 
the unconscious clutter of sleep. He 
kissed the Tables and replaced it in 
its niche under the quadrant. 

Sepharad’s sun had risen from 
the spires of Zamorah. It shone on 
Joseph’s naked body, burnt to a dark 
bronze by eighteen years under its 
alien brightness. He began, as always 
after the morning prayer, to ex- 
ercise. 

On his left shoulder was the still- 
painful mark of the Sephradim, a 
circle crosshatched with lines of lon- 
gitude and latitude, with which he 
had been tattooed on his eighteenth 
birthday. The Sephradim was a sign 
that his ancestors had come to Sep- 
harad directly from Earth. Original- 
ly, the tattoo had been the mark of a 
criminal — to be exact, of a mur- 
derer. But on Sepharad it was a dis- 
tinction greatly envied by the rest of 
the human population. 

His righl shoulder bore no tattoo: 
Joseph was a younger son. 

“Joseph!” his father’s Voice rang 
out from the terrace below. “Break- 
fast.” 

With lightning obedience, Joseph 
threw on a robe woven from Earth- 
grown cotton and ornamented with 
Sephradian diamonds. Since it was 
quicker than the stairs, he jumped 
down to the terrace from his bal- 
cony. His father’s hand was extended 
for a perfunctory kiss, which, per- 
functorily, was accorded it. His 
brother, to whom this honor had 
only recently come due, made more 
of a ceremony of it. Joseph poured 
out two carafes of coffee for them 
and, as was the duty of a second 



son, recited the prayer-before- 
meals. 

“I will have only one coffee this 
morning, Joseph. Therefore, you 
may have what is left — with David’s 
permission.” Joseph glanced hope- 
fully at his brother, who nodded his 
consent. 

“I thank you both.” He emptied 
the dregs of. the electric percolator 
into his own carafe. Usually he had 
to content himself with a second 
brewing of the grounds. His father 
passed him a salver of fruit taken 
from their own orchards, and Jo- 
seph selected a mango and bread- 
fruit. Native-grown products were 
seldom admitted to the Goldfrank 
table, but since on Earth the fruit 
of Sepharad was considered a great 
delicacy, and exception had been 
made. 

“Your brother and I will be gone 
throughout the day. I expect you to 
oversee Chilperic’s work. The mos- 
aic in the steam room needs to be 
repaired, and I shall want a roast to 
be ready for my evening meal. I 
shall be home by the next opposi- 
tion.” At sunset, the Parasol in the 
west and the sun in the east would 
again be in opposition, marking the 
end of a full day’s work. 

“A roast. Then, you — ” His fa- 
ther’s stern gaze silenced the un- 
necessary question. Roast meat 
meant only one thing: his father 
was going to perform an assassina- 
tion. 

Joseph wondered who was to be 
his father’s victim. But after all the 
name would probably mean nothing 
to him. He knew little of Sephradian 
politics. 



ASSASSIN AND SON 



97 




T he Goldfranks, father and sons, 
ate in silence, while the sun 
ruthlessly shortened the shadow of 
the eight-foot wall circling the ter- 
race. When there was no shade left, 
the elder Goldfrank rose. David fol- 
lowed him to the heliport. 

Joseph watched as the copter rose 
silently from its couch at the side of 
the house, like a jewel pendant in 
the bright morning sky, then turned 
to the capital city of Zamorah, a 
brighter jewel at the horizon. The 
copter had risen slowly, powered by 
a ten-horse antigravitic generator. 
Now it sped out of sight to the west 
as its side- jets caught fire and scor- 
ched their path across the sky. 

Chilperic, unbidden, wheeled out 
of the house to gather the breakfast 
dishes. Chilperic was a “blob.” as 
the natives of Sepharad were called 
by the Earth-born colonists — who 
had pre-empted the natural title of 
Sephradim for themselves. It was a 
measure of Goldfrank’s affluence 
that he could retain a blob as his ser- 
vant. It was not so much a question 
of Chilperic’s wages (which were ex- 
orbitant), but the expense of pro- 
viding the aluminum, mobile arma- 
ture in which Chilperic went about 
his chores in the Goldfrank house- 
hold. 

“Good morning, Master Joseph,” 
Chilperic’s voice box piped. “How 
does the Earth lie!” 

“Happily and far,” Joseph re- 
turned. 

“In what conjunction?” 

“Please, Chilperic! We don’t have 
to go through the whole ritual. 
There’s work to do.” 

“Your father has given the most 



explcit orders that the only ritual—” 

“Father is gone for the day, and 
you will take my orders. My first 
order is not to tell Father that I told 
you to be informal with me.” 

Chilperic laughed: “Ha-ha-ha.” 
Like the other phonetic elements of 
the voice box. the laughter was 
taped. It always sounded the same. 
Blobs, being telepathic among them- 
selves, had no need of voices. Chil- 
peric “spoke” with his fingers, using 
a phonetic typewriter inside the 
ovoid armature that enclosed his 
amorphous body like the eggshell 
about an egg. The smooth metal shell 
was dotted with sockets into which 
a variety of prosthetic limbs could 
be inserted. Chilperic thus gave all 
the appearances of being a robot; it 
was disquieting when he did not act 
like one. 

“I understand that I am to repair 
the mosaics in the steam room, just 
as I did last year.” 

“Yes.” 

“The steam room, if you will for- 
give my saying so, is a foolish place 
for a mosaic. But it is a foolish mo- 
saic.” 

Chilperic’s judgement of the Mi- 
ro reproduction coincided fairly well 
with Joseph’s own. The fluctu- 
ations of taste had led the younger 
generation on Sepharad to despise 
abstractionism ■ — as two generations 
before, when the Goldfrank villa 
had been constructed, they had been 
led to admire it. Nevertheless, as a 
servant, it was not Chilperic’s place 
to make judgments. Joseph re- 
minded him of this. 

“It is a beautiful work of art,” 
Chilperic apologized, “and a striking 



98 



IF 




example of the impossibility of two 
cultures understanding each other.” 
With this, Chilperic, bland as alum- 
inum, wheeled off to the kitchen with 
the breakfast table. 

Joseph sat down to memorize 
Volume IV. Chapter XXVII, Sec- 
tion V of Will Durant’s Story of 
Civilization. He was preparing for 
the priesthood. 

II 

Then the sun and the Parasol 
’ * had each risen 45° from the 
horizon and one fourth of the day 
was spent. Joseph set aside his his- 
tory text and went into the house to 
check on Chilperic’s work. 

It was hardly a necessary task. 
Like the robot he so much resem- 
bled, Chilperic was incapable of 
loitering. By nature the blobs were 
industrious, but Joseph’s father sus- 
pected that this invariable trait was 
no more than a clever deception, and 
he had communicated a good deal 
of this attitude to his sons. 

Like most Sephradim, the elder 
Goldfrank was convinced that the 
blobs were engaged in a subtle and 
relentless conspiracy against his per- 
son — an understandable obsession 
in a man who, more than twenty 
years as a professional assassin, had 
killed so many of their race that 
mere quantity was somehow beside 
the point. Goldfrank tolerated Chil- 
peric’s presence in the house for four 
reasons: It was a mark of prestige: 
Chilperic had worked for the family 
as long as the elder Goldfrank could 
remember, and to discharge him now 
would be an act of cowardice; he 



did the work of three human ser- 
vants (but then he was paid accord- 
ingly); and, lastly, Chilperic was 
sexually neuter, so that even Gold- 
frank could see that his most touchy 
suspicions had no basis in reason. 
“Master Joseph?” 

“Yes, Chilperic?” 

“If I finish repairing this exquisite 
mural by Eclipse, may I go into the 
village I am needed at a mating. It 
will take only a few minutes.” 
“Surely. And while you’re there 
stop by the Earth Quarter and pick 
up a roast for the evening meal. 
Father will return by opposition. It 
must be ready then.” 

“As you say.” Chilperic turned 
back to his work, but Joseph sus- 
pected that he was already signaling 
his six fellow-blobs in the village to 
expect him for the mating. 

The blobs were septsexual, a 
degree of sexual differentaton found 
only in free-form telepathic races. 
Joseph did not understand too pre- 
cisely the entire Sephradian mating 
process. There were, he knew, two 
blobs that performed a masculine 
function and two others that could 
be called women; the “mother” was 
hermaphroditic, then there were two 
neutral sexes who served somehow 
as catalysts. The “neuters” were 
not motivated by strictly sexual de- 
sires: the function of one was large- 
ly vegetative and of the other 
(which Chilperic represented) diges- 
tive. 

Chilperic had once attempted to 
give Joseph a more detailed explana- 
tion. But to Joseph, as to most hu- 
mans, the subject inspired disgust 
rather than scientific curiosity. With 



ASSASSIN AND SON 



99 




a mental shrug of his shoulders, 
Chilperic had abandoned the discus- 
sion. 

The effect of this septsexuality on 
the native Sephradian culture (and, 
indirectly, upon the human colon- 
ists) bad been enormous. The gov- 
ernment of the planet, from the 
Councils of the Empress at Zamorah 
to the meanest village bureaucracy, 
was based on the dynastic principle. 
The intricacies of dynastic politics 
were complicated by five-way sexual 
intrigues (the two neutral sexes be- 
ing neutral in this too). Murder — 
for reasons of passion or ambition — 
were not uncommon. Moreover, the 
result of murder among the telepa- 
thic blobs was a vampire-like height- 
ening of the mental powers of the 
murderer at the moment that his 
victim died. A mass-murderer be- 
came, by the very commission of his 
crimes, almost too powerful to des- 
troy. On Sepharad, therefore, there 
was every incitement to murder, and 
so it lay under the strictest taboo. 
But the taboo did not, of course, 
affect other races. 

The appearance upon Sepharad 
of Earthmen had brought about a 
large-scale cultural transformation. 
Earthmen, not being telepaths and 
not being subject to telepathic in- 
fluence, could murder a Sephradian 
without inheriting his victim’s store 
of mental powers — and without be- 
ing daunted by them. Earthmen, in 
fact, seemed to be indifferent to 
any consideration but the fee they 
received for their work. The pro- 
fessional assassin was born. The gov- 
ernment of Earth, when it learned of 
these developments on Sepharad, 



accommodated its economic ally by 
using the alien planet as a prison 
colony. Murderers were given the 
choice between life imprisonment on 
Venus and transportation to Seph- 
arad. 

They all chose Sepharad. 

Joseph was the great-great-grand- 
son of Leonard Goldfrank, a pro- 
fessional murderer of some notor- 
iety in Chicago in the year 2330. 
It was equivalent to a Mayflower 
pedigree. 

O utside, indistinctly, Joseph heard 
a knock on the gate. Even mu- 
ted by the heavy walls of the houes, 
he recognized it as Leora’s. He went 
across the terrace to the thick oak 
gate (not Earth-grown oak, but ex- 
pensive just the same) set into the 
terrace’s enclosing wall and admit- 
ted his brother’s fiancee. 

Indiscreetly, Leora Hughes re- 
moved her veil. Joseph had seen 
her face before — when David was 
present — but even so he averted 
his eyes. 

“Silly!” Leora chided. “You can 
look at me. After all, in a few 
weeks, I’ll be living here.” It was, 
of course, equally true that in a few 
weeks Joseph would no longer be 
living in his father’s house, but 
Leora did not draw such fine dis- 
tinctions. 

Blushing, Joseph looked at her, 
avoiding the mocking intensity of 
her dark eyes, covertly admiring the 
carefully preserved pallor of her 
skin, the fullness of her lower lip 
made fuller by carmine. “My brother 
is gone for the day.” 

“He’s — working!” she asked. The 



too 



IF 




mockery was suddenly absent from 
her eyes and her face went somewhat 
paler. 

“With Father, yes. But they’ll be 
back this evening. I’ll say you were 
here.” 

“I am still here. Aren’t you going 
to ask me into the house? If I leave 
now, I’ll certainly be overcome by 
the heat.” With the sun still an 
hour from Eclipse, the tempera- 
ture was 98° Farenheit. “Be- 
sides,” Leora went on, as Joseph 
led her to the atrium, where a mar- 
ble dolphin’s head (imported from 
Italy) gargled out a steady stream 
of chilled water — “besides. I’d just 
as soon talk to you as David. David 
never has anything to talk about.” 
“What would you like him to talk 
about! His work?” 

“Don’t be bitter, Joseph. As a 
priest, you’re going to be a fine as- 
sassin, I must say.” 

He laughed. “I’ll admit I used to 
be jealous of David — ” 

“Didn’t you! I remember when we 
were seven, playing outside, the 
Quarterhouse. You told me — ” 

“ — But I am over that. If every 
one could be an assassin just by 
wanting it, no one would do any- 
thing else — farmers, mechanics, 
store-keepers. Besides being a priest 
is the next best thing.” 

“That’s just what I meant. Next 
best.” 

“I mean, with regard to money.” 
Leora pursed her lips and nodded 
with ironic sympathy. “What I like 
about my future brother-in-law is 
his honesty. When other priests talk 
about ‘keeping alive the sacred her- 
itage of the human race’ or ‘the 



delights and comforts of a life of 
contemplation and learning,’ you 
talk about money.” 

“I like money. The other things 
are important, too. But when you’re 
eighteen, sacred history — ” 

“ — is a bore.” 

“What I like about my future 
sister-in-law is her immodesty.” 

It was Leora’s turn to blush. “What 
do you mean!” Joseph glanced re- 
proachfully at her veil that she held 
loosely in her fingers, its silver sash 
brushing the terrazzo floor. “But 
that! I mean — all the times when 
we were children, it’s ridiculous.” 
“But now we’re not children. 
David wouldn’t think it was ridicu- 
lous.” 

She fixed the veil over her face, 
so that Joseph could see only her 
eyes glaring at him angrily. “I’d 
better start home. Tell David I 
missed him.” 

“Good-by, Leora.” But Leora did 
not glance back, or say good-by. 

I t seemed strange to think of 
Leora as his brother’s fiancee: 
Leora, who, in the irresponsible 
years when they went to school with 
each other — before, that is, she had 
adopted the veil of womanhood and 
stopped coming to the afternoon 
classes at the Quarterhouse — had 
been his special friend. In fact, she 
had been rather more than that, al- 
though he had tried not to think 
how much more. 

How it must seem to Leora he 
did not ask himself. As a woman, 
it would make little difference how 
she felt. The marriage had been 
arranged between their fathers on 



ASSASSIN AND SON 



101 




the day that David had come of 
age, one year ago. 

It seemed strange that, a whole 
year later, it still seemed strange. 

The last sliver of the sun slipped 
behind the enormous man-made Par- 
asol, and the artificial night of the 
Sephradian noonday descended over 
the land. Joseph knelt and faced the 
western sky. There, insignificant be- 
side the greater brightness of near-by 
Vega, Earth’s sun shone dimly and 
listened (or so he had been told at 
the Quarterhouse school) to his 
prayer. Joseph knew perfectly well 
that neither Earth, nor Earth’s sun. 
actually listened to him. He some- 
times doubted that anything or any- 
one listened at all — except some- 
times, his father. More than once Jo- 
seph had been beaten for neglecting 
the rituals, so that now they were 
almost second nature. 

The Eclipse lasted twenty min- 
utes as long as it took the sun trav- 
eling eastward to pass behind the 
Parasol, travelling in the contrary 
direction at the same speed. The 
great Parasol, its longitudinal axis 
describing a 10° arc across the sky, 
shielded Zamorah and its environs 
from the fiercest heat of the sun, 
gave a brief respite to the parching 
earth while the spillgates of the new 
irrigating systems were opened, and 
allowed the dweller of the planet, 
human or otherwise a chance to 
walk abroad shaded from the merci- 
less sun. The Parasol orbitted a mere 
hundred miles above the planet, the 
power for its antigravity plant being 
provided by the very sun whose 
rays its giant mirrors, visible as 
far away as the Lunar Ob- 



servatory, deflected into space. 
Earth had built the Parasol and 
its two fascimiles orbitting be- 
yond the horizon it had given them 
space. Earth had built the Parasol 
for Sepharad without cost, but not 
entirely from selfless motives. As a 
result of the lower mean temperature 
and the new pattern of pressure 
belts over once-arid plains, the agri- 
cultural output of Sepharad had 
more than doubled in the last fifty 
years. 

Of course, population had also 
boomed but not at all at the same 
rate. Septsexuality had certian ad- 
vantages vis-a-vis the Malthusian 
dilemma. Export was now Sep- 
harad’s largest industry, and Earth 
and her colonies were Sepharad’s 
chief markets. 

Joseph set off for his afternoon 
classes at the Quarterhouse as soon 
as he had rattled through the noon- 
day prayer. If he hurried he could 
arrive at the Human Quarter in the 
village before the twenty-minute 
Eclipse was over. 

E clipse was not a total darkness. 

the northern and southern hori- 
zons glowed with a dim, refracted 
light. 

In the gloom, Joseph could still 
discern the gold-lettered sign above 
the oak gate: GOLDFRANK & 
SON, ASSASSINATIONS. At the 
side of the villa was the family 
cemetery where ostentatious bronze 
crosses marked the graves of the 
men, and silver spheres — the mark 
of the Sephradim — stood above the 
women’s plots. The bronze crosses 
were weathered to a dull green, and 



102 



IF 




the silver spheres — all but one — 
were tarnished and gray. That one 
was his mother’s, killed two years 
before, while shopping in the vil- 
lage during one of the recurrent out- 
bursts against the colonists. 

Over a low hill, on Joseph’s right 
hand, was the Hughes’ villa, and 
farther on the flambuoyant four- 
story mansion of Oscar Milne. Gold- 
frank, Hughes and Milne were all 
three professional assassins, which 
was three more than the nearby vil- 
lage had need of itself. Most of their 
work was carried on in Zamorah. 
Prudence, however, had led them to 
establish suburban residences at a 
comfortable distance from the scene 
of their business. 

A few crude structures of scrap 
plastic, the dwellings of lower-caste 
Sephradians, stood on the outskirts 
of the Human Quarter. No blobs 
were at large during Eclipse — or, as 
the blobs referred to it, the Time of 
the Assassin. Although the Council 
of the Empress had sanctioned the 
construction of the Parasol, the 
average blob still regarded the daily 
blackout with superstitious terror. 
Custom had it that in the beginning 
the Eclipse had lasted mere seconds. 
Now the period of darkness was 
twenty minutes: and tomorrow? Ru- 
mors would spring up that the Time 
of the Assassin was growing longer. 
There would be local attacks on the 
colonists, who were thought to be 
responsible. Then the Empress’ Ar- 
my would dismiss the rioters and 
calm their fears — which the next 
Eclipse would resurrect, keeping the 
vicious circle steadily 'a-spin. There 
was little hope of stopping it as long 



as the blobs worshipped the sun. 

The Human Quarter looked 
slightly shabbier than the Sephradian 
slums on its outskirts. While the pro- 
fessonal assassin enjoyed the luxury 
of his villa, the average colonisl 
paid the price of his legal criminal- 
ity. They were rigidly segregated 
from the blobs, and building permits 
for their quarter were not easily 
obtained. Even jobs were scarce, 
short-lived and poorly paid. Since 
the colonists — and their offspring — 
were considered outlaws by the gov- 
ernment of Earth, they were denied 
even the hope of someday departing 
their prison. But for all that they 
were probably happier on Sepharad 
than they would have been on Ven- 
us. Happiness is a relative state. 

Joseph did not like the Quarter. 
He hurried through it to his school, 
haunted by the thought that in only 
a few weeks this would be his home. 

Then, abruptly, he halted. Direc- 
tly ahead of him a blob cased in the 
special fenestrated armature of the 
Imperial Civil Service wheeled down 
the street from the Quarterhouse, 
flanked on each side by guards in 
less ornamental shells. Joseph reco- 
gnized the blob (or, more exactly, he 
recognized the armature) and bowed 
his head as it passed him: Sisebat, 
the most powerful Sephradian in the 
village and its mayor. 

He did not look like a murderer, 
Joseph thought. But then — neither 
did his own father. 

Ill 

CCA7"er father’s a blob-lover!” 

1 “Shut up, Jamie,” Joseph 



ASSASSIN AND SON 



103 




calmly commanded, but his eyes re- 
vealed well enough that he was 
afraid. A ring of boys had begun to 
form around them in the street out- 
side the Quarterhouse. 

Jamie Hughes, his father’s only 
son and a future assassin himself, 
was not to be shut up that easily. 
“Yeah — he’s the eighth man at a 
mating!” He made an obscene ges- 
ture. 

Joseph swung. Jamie had been 
ready, and Joseph found himself ly- 
ing on the stony street, blood drip- 
ping from his nose. 

“Say he is!” Jamie taunted. “Say 
he’s a blob-lover.” Jamie fed Joseph’s 
rage with professional expertise. 

Enraged, Joseph lunged to his 
feet, not flailing his fists as Jamie 
had expected, instead butting his 
head into the boy’s stomach. They 
went down together. Jamie pounded 
at the base of Joseph’s neck with the 
calloused side of his hand, Joseph 
bringing up his knee toward Jamie’s 
midriff. Jamie twisted out of his 
grasp, ripping his clothing to avoid 
the well-aimed knee. Then Jamie 
began to kick his ribs. 

It was not an even match. Jamie, 
although he was two years younger 
and inches shorter than Joseph, was 
in training to be a killer. Joseph 
had not fought with anyone for the 
past year — and he had never, ex- 
cept for some playful tussles with 
his brother, fought with an assassin- 
to-be. 

Two of the older boys were try- 
ing to pull Jamie away. While his 
attention was diverted by the peace- 
makers, Joseph grabbed his leg and 
toppled him to the pavement, crack- 



ing his head against the stone ar.J 
stunning him sufficiently to allow 
Joseph to purchase hold on his 
throat unresisted. Thumbs pressed 
against the windpipe, quite blind 
now to anything but the pleasure of 
the violence — the triumph — 
strangling . 

“Joseph! Joseph!” 

It was unmistakably the voice of 
M agister Sontag, the Instructor of 
Earth History at the Quarterhouse 
and Master of the Rituals. Joseph 
loosened his grip on Jame’s throat 
and looked to the Magister where 
he frowned down from a second- 
floor dormer window. “Come up to 
my office this minute — but first 
apologize to Master Hughes.” 

“I apologize,” Joseph mumbled. 
“Yeah — blob-lover,” Jamie said, 
sotto voice, accepting Joseph’s hand. 

As he ascended the stairs to 
Sontag’s office, tears of shame wel- 
led up in Joseph’s eyes. 

“Sit down, Joseph. Here’s a 
damp towel for your nose. Do you 
feel all in one piece?” 

“Yes. I’m very sorry; it was my 
fault. I — ” 

“Please, no false contrition. If I 
know Jamie at all, it was probably 
his fault. What did he do?” 

“He wanted me to kiss his ring. 
As though I were his younger broth- 
er! I don’t have to do that — it’s 
not part of the Rituals.” 

“Strictly speaking, of course not. 
But I have noticed that usually you 
are rather liberal in interpreting the 
Rituals. By refusing Jamie, you 
gave him the pretext he was looking 
for to fight with you.” 

“He called my father — ” 



104 



IF 



“ — enough names, doubtless, so 
that you struck the first blow. Jamie 
would see to that.” The Magister 
sat down behind his desk and began 
to stroke the long beard signalizing 
his priesthood. “Humility is a les- 
son that is difficult for the young to 
learn. I don’t want to scold you 
for today’s little adventure — you’re 
not one to repeat mistakes. And I 
don’t want to suggest that you’re 
too high-spirited. A candidate for 
the priesthood should not be devoid 
of spirit, though that is using the 
word in a rather different sense. 
Yours seem to be animal spirits.” 
Joseph looked up from the blood- 
stained towel, smiling. The Magister 
was smiling too. “I’m sure you’ll 
learn to tame them at the seminary. 
Now — ” he pressed a button on the 
side of his desk — “will you join me 
for a late lunch?” 

“With pleasure.” 

A girl, obviously still in her teens 
despite the veil that hid her face 
and the loose robe that hid most of 
her other features, entered and stood 
before the Magister. 

“Bring wine and biscuits for 
two, Esther.” 

Esther Sontag acknowledged her 
father’s order with a slight bow. 
She glanced quickly at the towel 
Joseph still held to bis nose and 
then, less quickly, into Joseph’s eyes 
where she found no reply nor recog- 
nition. Joseph always avoided meet- 
ing her anxious, darting eyes, for 
he knew that his father and the 
Magister were still bickering over 
the financial details of their betroth- 
al. It was only a matter of time 



before their engagement was an- 
nounced, and Joseph did not want 
Esther to read in his eyes the com- 
plete indifference he felt for her. 
Until their wedding, he could spare 
her that pain, at least. 

“Well, Joseph, are you eager to be 
off to the seminary? Eh? No one is 
ever eager to become a priest, so 
don’t lie.” 

“Willing, but not eager.” 

“You’ll like it. You’re a good 
student, and there will be many his- 
tory texts there you’ve never seen — 
Toynebee, Gibbon. Or, if you pre- 
fer the classics, as I do, Plutarch, 
Herodotus. You do enjoy studying 
history, don’t you?” 

“Next to making it. I can think 
of no finer pursuit.” 

“I shall debate that point when 
you have had a chance to read Cae- 
sar’s Commentaries. But, tell me, 
Joseph, if you could choose your 
way of life instead of inheriting it, 
would you have become a priest? 
No, don’t answer that; it’s not a 
fair question. We always imagine 
that, if we were free, we would 
be somewhere else, doing something 
better. Perhaps you know that I was 
the second son of an assassin my- 
self. Sontag was once a famous name 
on Zamorah. I can remember the 
day my father packed me off for 
the seminary. I wasn’t exactly eager 
myself. Willing, but not eager.” 
“And you had wanted to be an 
assassin?” Indirectly, this was Jo- 
seph’s answer to the Magister’s ques- 
tion. Neither of them felt it neces- 
sary to be more explicit than that. 

“I did. Three months later my 
father was killed. By the time 1 



ASSASSIN AND SON 



105 




was a priest, my older brother was 
also dead — but not before he had 
avenged our father’s death.” 

“It’s a dangerous profession.” 

“But that is not my lesson. The 
assassin sows death, and death is 
his reaping.” 

“The lex talionis ,” Joseph ob- 
served as though reciting a lesson, 
and the Magister, as though satis- 
fied with his recitation, changed the 
subject. 

“Do you wish to return to Earth 
someday, Joseph?” 

“It is the wish of every Sephra- 
dim.” 

“We will never be allowed to 
leave this planet. Not until we can 
learn to live here without doing vi- 
olence. or sanctioning it. On Earth, 
your father would be a criminal.” 
“For killing blobs!” 

“Yes — and for his other mur- 
ders.” 

“The men he killed were assassins. 
He had no choice when he did it! 
The courts proved it was self-de- 
fense.” 

“A murderer defending himself 
against other murderers. On Earth, 
a court that tolerate any murder 
is considered criminal itself. In short, 
we live in a criminal society.” 

“Will a few priests and a dozen 
history books be able to change 
that? Excuse me, I didn’t mean — ” 
“Of course you meant it. You’re 
right. But it isn’t the priests, or 
even the society that must be chang- 
ed. It is each person, in his heart. 
You have read enough Earth his- 
tory by now to have come to that 
conclusion yourself. Durant says — ” 
Esther entered without knocking. 



“Father!” she gasped. Her face was 
unveiled, but the features which 
Joseph saw revealed now for the 
first time communicated only one 
sensation - — fear. “Father, there are 
blobs downstairs! They — ” 

Sisebat stood in the open door be- 
hind Esther. Four guards wheeled 
into the room. “I have come for 
the prisoner, Joseph Goldfrank,” 
Sisebat announced. There was the 
sting of the guard’s needle at the 
base of his neck, and then nothing 
. darkness . eclipse. 

IV 

T erra-father, Gaea-mother, Earth! 

You may have what is left — 
with David’s permission . 

Under his body, bare, cold stone; 
hauds tied tight behind his back. 

Then Leora’s voice: ... a fine 
assassin, I must say. And his reply: 
the lex talionis . avenged . 

The image of Chilperic wheeling 
toward him, at the edge of conscious- 
ness now, was part of a dream. He 
was waking. 

The image seemed too real. 
There was a blob, but it was not 
Chilperic. He did not recognize the 
room in which he found himself. 
It was almost a cell. He remembered 
that he was a prisoner and rose 
to his knees on the floor, straining 
against the ropes that tightly bound 
him. 

“Father!” he cried. “My father, 
is he — ” 

“Your father is dead. And your 
brother as well. They attempted to 
assassinate the Empress. The village 
has confiscated their estate, but 



106 



IF 




generously our mayor, Sisebat, has 
allowed you to live. I am to accom- 
pany you to the village where you 
may gather your personal posses- 
sions. My name is Egica.” 

“Dead, you say? Both? Dead?” 
“Will you need to be guarded, 
or shall I untie you?” 

“I don't feel angry ... or vio- 
lent. That’s strange.” 

“Not strange at all: the sedation 
does not wear off immediately. But 
I advise you not to become violent. 
I am, as your language has it, 
armed.” Joseph felt Egica’s dextrous 
psuedopodia unravelling the knots in 
the rope. The wet plasma brushed 
his wrists. His skin had never felt 
the flesh of a blob till then. 

“This way.” 

“It’s night.” 

“Yes, two hours, past the sunset.” 
“And I am not a prisoner?” 

“No. The Magister spoke on your 
behalf — and quite eloquently, too. 
He promised Sisebat that you were 
devoted to ideals of nonviolence, that 
you were to be a priest. Sisebat 
seemed to believe him. At least, he 
accepted his bribe, which was prob- 
ably all that he wanted.” 

“Then you didn’t believe him?” 
“I advised our mayor to be merci- 
ful. Your death might have offended 
the human colonists unnecessarily. 
As for your idealism or lack of it, 
I profess no opinion.” 

Joseph discovered that he had 
been crying, and it came over him 
now that his father and his brother 
were no longer alive, that the roast 
was either cold now or forgotten in 
the oven, turning to ash. 

“How were they killed?” 



“With laser-guns. They felt no 
pain, I’m sure. The bodies — what 
was left — were brought back to 
your villa. You will see.” 

T hey walked the rest of the way 
in silence. Chilperic admitted 
them at the gate. The bodies lay 
on separate plastic mats on the ter- 
race. It was impossible to tell which 
had been his father. 

The next thing Joseph was aware 
of was Chilperic’s voice — Joseph, 
get up. Can you stand up? Joseph, 
can I help? And then the wet pres- 
sure of Chilperic’s psuedopodia 
against his bare shoulders. Joseph 
recoiled from that touch, not 
screaming yet, though perhaps he 
was — Get away — remembering 
the sensation, his horror, Chilperic’s 
touch, wishing only to be outside his 
body. And then it seemed he was 
merely a spectator as his hands up- 
ended the blob’s armature and rolled 
it over on the stone floor, a specta- 
tor of the fully-distended psuedopod 
that reached toward him until the 
heavy armature rolled over on it, 
and it broke then and lay on the 
stone floor, a streak of jelly. And 
Chilperic’s cry — Jo-seph — that 
seemed though it issued from a me- 
chanical voice box, to be choked 
with pain and grief. 

He did scream then — stricken by 
a terror not of the forgotten touch 
but of his own irredeemable deed. 
He only noticed the laser projecting 
from Egica’s metal shell after he 
had raised Chilperic upright. 

“He did not mean to do it,” 
Chilperic’s voice box enunciated, 
more for Joseph’s benefit than 



ASSASSIN AND SON 



107 




Egica’s whom he had already re- 
strained from using the laser, tele- 
pathically. “When his father’s father 
was killed, it was just the same. To 
them, we are all alike ... all guil- 
ty. I am older now; that is the only 
difference. Slower to move — and to 
mend.” 

“Chilpcric — ” 

“Quite. I have no time to . 
Humans are a little insane, but it is 
over quickly ... a terrible mosaic.” 

“I know. I’ll have it taken down.” 

“Ha-ha-ha . Joseph — be like 
— ” Chilperic spoke no more. There 
was a vague, liquid sound within the 
armature, as the blob’s body relaxed 
into death. 

“What did he want to say?” Jo- 
seph asked, turning to Egica. 

“Be like your father.” 

“An assassin?” 

“That was his meaning, but he 
would not have used that word.” 
Egica paused. When he resumed, 
his words came more slowly. “It 
is also my meaning. As I understand 
your laws, your Ritual, you are en- 
titled now, since your brother is 
dead, to become an assassin. It is 
hereditary. Am I right?” 

“Can you talk about that now?” 

“At no time else, I am afraid. 
You are responsible for Chilperic’s 
death.” 

“I know. I know." 

“My testimony could damn you. 
You can be tried, convicted, and 
sentenced to death. But an assassin 
would not be tried. He is licensed 
to do murder, and he lives outside 
the laws. Sisebat will never grant 
that license to you; he has to much 
to fear. But I will — when I am 



mayor. I will also allow you to re- 
claim your father’s estate. Therefore, 
you will assassinate Sisebat tonight.” 
“And if I refuse?” 

“I cannot return to the village 
until Sisebat is dead. He will know 
that I have plotted his death, and 
he will kill me. Therefore, if you 
refuse I will kill you.” 

“You give me little choice.” 
“There is not much to give.” 
“I will do it.” 

“Chilperic was right. You will 
be the very image of your father.” 

V 

R eturning to the village that 
night, his father’s laser-gun hid- 
den beneath a heavy woolen robe 
(made in England), Joseph allowed 
himself the luxury of idle specula- 
tion. In the future, it would be a 
luxury that he could ill afford. 

He speculated, for instance, on 
the problem of free will. He re- 
flected that, being forced into a 
career that he had only that after- 
noon freely desired, he no longer 
desired that career. Necessity had a 
bitter taste. 

He thought of Leora, whom he 
would now surely marry, although a 
few hours ago he would not have 
allowed himself to admit that he 
was in love with her. Though she 
would be happier wed to him, 
though she might even have desired 
it, she was as much a slave of neces- 
sity as Joseph. She would wed him 
not for love’s sake, but because he 
had inherited her from his brother 
and her father would not leave her 
any choice. 



108 



IF 




Joseph wondered if necessity 
would have the same taste for 
Leora. 

He thought of Magister Sontag, 
gratefully and already with a sense 
of nostalgia. Later that night he 
would have the Magister tattoo on 
his right shoulder the mark of the 
Assassin: a shortsword crossed 

by a dagger, the same emblem that 
would be cast in bronze and set over 
his father’s grave. Esther would 
probably be watching in secret. He 



was surprised that, for the first 
time, he thought of Esther with af- 
fection. 

And, when he stood before the 
mayor’s dwelling in the center of the 
village, he thought of Sisebat. 

A servant answered the door. 

“I wish to see the mayor — to 
thank him for sparing my life.” 

The servant (who was a human) 
bowed to Joseph and ushered him 
into a large hall. “This way, please.”

Illustrated by EMSH 



Marchand's life was In vain 
— but his failure was his 
greatest possible success/ 



r orman Marchand sat in the 
I wings of the ballroom’s small 



stage, on a leather hassock someone 
had found for him. There were fif- 
teen hundred people outside in the 
ballroom, waiting to do him honor. 

Marchand remembered the ball- 
room very well. He had once owned 



it. Forty ... no, it wasn’t forty. 
Not even fifty. Sixty years ago it 'j 
had been, sixty and more years ago ,| 
that he and Joyce had danced in that j 
ballroom. Then the hotel was the j 
newest on Earth and he was the ;‘j 
newly married son of the man who ’J 
had built it, and the party was the J 
reception for his wedding to Joyce. | 
Of course, none of these people J 



no 



would know about that. But Mar- 
chand remembered . Oh, Joyce, 
my very clear! But she had been 
dead a long time now. 

It was a noisy crowd. He peered 
out through the wings, and could 
see the head table filling up. There 
was the Vice-President of the United 
States shaking hands with the Gov- 
ernor of Ontario as though, for the 
moment, they had forgotten they 
were of different parlies. There was 
Linfox, from the Institute, obligingly 
helping a chimpanzee into the chair 
next to what, judging by the micro- 
phones ranked before it, would prob- 
ably be Marchand’s own. Linfox 
seemed a little ill at ease with the 
chimp. The chimpanzee had no 
doubt been smithed, but the imposi- 
tion of human intelligence did not 
lengthen its ape’s legs. 

Then Dan Fleury appeared, up 
the steps from the floor of the ball- 
room where the rest of the fifteen 
hundred diners were taking their 
places. 

Fleury didn’t look well at all, 
Marchand thought — not without a 
small touch of satisfaction, since 
Fleury was fifteen years younger 
than himself. Still, Marchand wasn’t 
jealous. Not even of the young bell- 
man who had brought him the has- 
sock, twenty years at the most and 
built like a fullback. One life was 
enough for a man to live. Especially 
when you had accomplished the 
dream you had set out to bring to 
fruition. Or almost. 

Of course, it cost him everything 
his father left. But what else was 
money for? 

“It’s time to go in, sir. May I 



help you!” It was the young fullback 
nearly bursting his bellman’s uniform 
with the huge hard muscles of youth. 
He was very solicitous. One of the 
nice things about having this testi- 
monial dinner in a Marchand hotel 
was that the staff was as deferential 
to him as though he still owned the 
place. Probably that was why the 
committee had picked it, Marchand 
ruminated, quaint and old-fashioned 
as the hotel must seem now. Though 
at one time — 

He recollected himself. “I’m sor- 
ry, young man. I was — woolgather- 
ing. Thank you.” 

He stood up, slowly but not very 
painfully, considering that it had 
been a long day. As the fullback 
walked him onto the stage the ap- 
plause was enough to drive down the 
automatic volume control on his 
hearing aid. 

For that reason he missed the 
first words from Dan Fleury. No 
doubt they were complimentary. 
Very carefully he lowered himself 
into his chair, and as the clapping 
eased off he was able to begin to 
hear the words. 

D ; an Fleury was still a tall man, 
built like a barrel, with bushy 
eyebrows and a huge mane of hair. 
He had helped Marchand’s mad pro- 
ject for thrusting man into space 
from its very beginnings. He said as 
much now. “Man’s grandest dream!” 
he roared. “The conquering of the 
stars themselves! And here is the one 
man who taught us how to dream 
it, Norman Marchand!” 

Marchand bowed to the storm of 
applause. 



FATHER OF THE STARS 



Til 




Again his hearing aid saved his 
ears and cost him the next few 
words: “ — and now that we are on 
the threshhold of success,” Fleury 
was booming, “it is altogether fitting 
that we should gather here tonight 
. to join in fellowship and in the 
expression of that grand hope ... to 
rededicate ourselves to its fulfill- 
ment . and to pay our respects, 
and give of our love, to the man 
who first showed us what dream to 
have!” 

While the AVC registered the 
power of Dan Fleury ’s oratory Mar- 
chand smiled out on the foggy sea of 
faces. It was, he thought, almost 
cruel of Fleury to put it like that. 
The threshhold of success indeed! 
How many years now had they 
waited on it patiently? — and the 
door still locked in their faces. Of 
course, he thought wryly, they must 
have calculated that the testimoni- 
al dinner would have to be held soon 
unless they wanted a cadaver for a 
guest. But still . He turned pain- 
fully and looked at Fleury, half 
perplexed. There was something in 
his tone. Was there — Could there 
be — 

There could not, he told himself 
firmly There was no news, no break- 
through, no report from one of the 
wandering ships, no dream come true 
at last. He would have been the first 
to know. Not for anything would 
they have kept a thing like that from 
him. And he did not know that 
thing. 

“ — and now,” Fleury was saying, 
“I won’t keep you from your din- 
ners. There will be many a long, 
strong speech to help your digestions 



afterwards, I promise you! But now, 
let’s eat!” 

Laughter. Applause. A buzz and 
clash of forks. 

The injunction to eat did not, of 
course, include Norman Marchand. 
He sat with his hands in his lap, 
watching them dig in, smiling and 
feeling just a touch deprived, with 
the wry regret of the very old. He 
didn’t envy the young people any- 
thing really, he told himself. Not 
their health, their youth or their life 
expectancy. But he envied them the 
bowls of ice. 

He tried to pretend he enjoyed his 
wine and the huge pink shrimp in 
crackers and milk. According to 
Asa Czerny, who ought to know 
since he had kept Marchand alive 
this long, he had a clear choice. He 
could eat whatever he chose, or he 
could stay alive. For a while. And 
ever since Czerny had been good 
enough, or despairing enough, to 
give him a maximum date for his 
fife exectancy, Marchand had in idle 
moments tried to calculate just how 
much of those remaining months he 
was willing to give up for one really 
good meal. He rather believed that 
when Czerny looked up at him after 
the weekly medical checkup and said 
that only days were left, that he 
would take those last days and trade 
them in for a sauerbraten with pota- 
to pancakes and sweet-sour red cab- 
bage on the side. But that time was 
not yet. With any kind of luck he 
still had a month. Perhaps as much 
as two ... “I beg your — pardon,” 
he said, half-turning to the chimpan- 
zee. Even smithed, the animal spoke 
so poorly that Marchand had not 



112 





FATHER OF THE STARS 





at first known that he was being 
addressed. 

He should not have turned. 

His wrist had lost its suppleness; 
the spoon in his hand tilted : the sog- 
gy crackers fell. He made the mis- 
take of trying to move his knee out 
of the way — it was bad enough to 
be old, he did not want to be sloppy 
— and he moved too quickly. 

The chair was at the very edge of 
the little platform. He felt himself 
going over. 

Ninety-six is too old to be falling 
on your head, he thought, if I was 
going to do this sort of thing I 
might just as well have eaten some 
of those shrimp . Blit he did not 
kill himself. 

He only knocked himself uncon- 
scious. And not for very long at 
that, because he began to wake up 
while they were still carrying him 
back to his dressing room behind the 
stage. 

O nce upon a time. Norman Mar- 
chand had given his life to a 

hope. 

Rich, intelligent, married to a girl 
of beauty and tenderness, he had 
taken everything he owned and given 
it to the Institute for Colonizing 
Extra-Solar Planets. He had, to be- 
gin with, given away several million 
dollars. 

That was the whole of the person- 
al fortune his father had left him, 
and it was nowhere near enough to 
do the job. It was only a catalyst. 
He had used it to hire publicity 
men, fund-raisers, investment coun- 
selors, foundation managers. He had 
spent it on documentary films and 



on TV commercials. With it he had 
financed cocktail parties for United 
States senators and prize contests 
for the nation’s sixth grades, and he 
had done what he set out to do. 

He had raised money. A very great 
deal of money. 

He had taken all the money he 
had begged and teased out of the 
pockets of the world and used it to 
finance the building of twenty-six 
great ships, each the size of a dozen 
ocean liners, and he had cast them 
into space like a farmer sowing 
wheat upon the wind. 

I tried, he whispered to himself, 
returning from the darkest place he 
had ever seen. I wanted to see man 
reach out and touch a new home . 
and I wanted to be the one to 
guide him there . 

And someone was saying: “ — he 
know about it, did he? But we were 
trying to keep it quiet — ” Someone 
else told the first person to shut his 
mouth. Marchand opened his eyes. 

Czerny was there, unsmiling He 
saw that Marchand was conscious. 
“You’re all right,” he said and 
Marchand knew that it was true, 
since Czerny was scowling angrily at 
him. If the news had been bad he 
would have smiled — “No you 
don’t!” cried Czerney, catching him 
by the shoulder. “You stay right 
there. You’re going home to bed.” 
“But you said I was all right.” 
“I meant you were still breathing. 
Don’t push it, Norm.” 

Marchand protested, “But the din- 
ner — I ought to be there — ” 

Asa Czerny had cared for Mar- 
chand for thirty years. They had 
gone fishing together, and once or 



114 



IF 




twice they had gotten drunk. Czerny 
would not have refused for nothing. 
He only shook his head. 

Marchand slumped back. Behind 
Czerny the chimpanzee was squat- 
ting silently on the edge of a chair, 
watching. He’s worried, Marchand 
though. Worried because he feels 
it’s his fault, what happened to me. 
The thought gave him enough 
strength to -say: “Stupid of me to 
fall like that, Mr. — I’m sorry.” 
Czerny supplied the introduction. 
“This is Duane Ferguson, Norman. 
He was supernumary on the Coper- 
nicus. Smithed. He’s attending the 
dinner in costume, as it were.” The 
chimpanzee nodded but did not 
speak. He was watching that silver- 
tongued orator, Dan Fleury, who 
seemed upset. “Where is that ambu- 
lance?” demanded Czerny, with a 
doctor’s impatience with internes, 
and the fullback in bellman’s uni- 
form hurried silently away to find 
out. 

T he chimpanzee made a barking 
sound, clearing his throat. 
“Ghwadd,” he said — more or less: 
the German ich sound followed by 
word “what” — “Ghwadd did 
jou mee-an aboud evdial, Midda 
Vleury?” 

Dan Fleury turned and looked at 
the chimp blankly. But not, Mar- 
chand thought suddenly, as though 
he didn’t know what the chimp was 
talking about. Only as if he didn’t 
intend to answer. 

Marchand rasped, “What’s this 
‘evdial’ Dan?" 

“Search me. Look, Mr Ferguson, 
perhaps we’d better go outside.” 



“Ghwadd?” The harsh barking 
voice struggled against the simian 
body it occupied, and came closer 
to the sounds it meant to emit. 
“What did you bean — did you 
mean?” 

He was a rude young man, Mar- 
chand thought irritably. The fellow 
was tiring him. 

Although there was something 
about that insistent question — 

Marchand winced and felt for a 
moment as though he were going to 
throw up. It passed, leaving him 
wobbly. It wasn’t possible he had 
broken anything, he told himself. 
Czerny would not lie about that. 
But he felt as if he had. 

He lost interest in the chimp-man, 
did not even turn his head as 
Fleury hurried him out of the room, 
whispering to him in an agitated and 
lowpitched chirrup like the scratch- 
ing of a cricket’s legs. 

If a man wanted to abandon his 
God-given human body and put his 
mind, thoughts and — yes — soul 
into the corpus of an anthropoid, 
there was nothing in that to entitle 
him to any special consideration 
from Norman Marchand. 

Of course not! Marchand rehears- 
ed the familiar argument as he 
waited for the ambulance. Men who 
volunteered for the interstellar flights 
he had done so much to bring about 
knew what they were getting into. 
Until some frabjous super-Batman 
invented the mythical FTL drive it 
would always be so. At possible 
speeds — less than light’s 186,000 
mps crawl — it was a matter of de- 
cades to reach almost every worth- 
while planet that was known. 



FATHER OF THE STARS

The Smith process allowed these 
men to use their minds to control 
chimpanzee bodies — easily bred, ut- 
terly expendable — while their own 
bodes rested in the deep-freeze for 
all the long years between the stars. 

It took brave men, naturally. They 
were entitled to courtesy and consid- 
eration. 

But so was he, and it was not 
courteous to blather about “ev- 
dial”. whatever that was, while the 
man who had made their trip pos- 
sible was seriously injured . 

Unless . 

Marchand opened his eyes again. 

“Evdiat.” Unless “evdial” was the 
closest chimpanzee vocal chords and 
chimpanzee lips could come to — 
to — 

— unless what they had been talk- 
ing about, while he was unconscious, 
was that utterly impossible, hopeless 
and fantastic dream that he, Mar- 
chand, has had turned his back upon 
when he began organizing the colon- 
ization campaign. 

Unless someone had really found 
the way to FTL travel. 

II 

A s soon as he was able the next 
day, Marchand got himself into 
a wheelchair — all by himself, he 
didn’t want any help in this — and 
rolled it out into the chartroom of 
the home the Institute had given 
him rentfree for all of his life. 
(He had, of course, given it in the 
first place to the Institute.) 

The Institute had put three hun- 
dred thousand dollars into the chart 
room. Stayed and guy wired stars 



flecked the volume of a forty-‘o.H 
ballroom, representing in scale all 
the space within fifty-five light-years 
of Sol. Every star was mapped and 
tagged. They had even moved a few 
of them slightly, a year ago, to 
correct for proper motion: it was 
that carefully done. 

The twenty-six great starships the 
Institute had financed were there, 
too, or such of them as were still 
in space. They were out of scale, 
of course, but Marchand understood 
what they represented. He rolled his 
chair down the marked path to the 
center of the room and sat there, 
looking around, just under yellow 
Sol. 

There was blue-white Sirius domi- 
nating them all, Procyon hanging 
just above. The two of them to- 
gether were incomparably the bright- 
est objects in the room, though red 
Altair was brighter in its own right 
than Procyon. In the center of the 
chamber Sol and Alpha Centauri A 
made a brillant pair. 

He gazed with rheuming eyes at 
that greatest disappointment of his 
life Alpha Centauri B. So close. So 
right. So sterile. It was an ironic 
blunder of creation that the nearest 
and best chance of another home 
had never formed planets ... or had 
formed them and swept them into 
the Bode-area traps set by itself and 
its two companions. 

But there were other hopes .... 

Marchand sought and found Tau 
Ceti, yellow and pale. Only eleven 
light-years away, the colony should 
be definitely established by now. 
In another decade or less they should 
have an answer ... if, of course, it 



116 



IF 



had planets Man could live on. 

That was the big question, to 
which they had already received so 
many “nos”. But Tau Ceti was still 
a good bet, Marchand told himself 
stoutly. It was a dimmer, cooler sun 
than Sol. But it was type G, and 
according to spectropolarimetry, al- 
most certainly planetiferous. And if 
it were another disappointment — 

Marchand turned his eyes to 40 
Eridani A, even dimmer, even far- 
ther away. The expedition to 40 Eri- 
dani A had been, he remembered, 
the fifth ship he had launched. It 
ought to be reaching its destination 
soon — this year, or perhaps next. 
There was no sure way of estimat- 
ing time when the top velocity was 
so close to light’s own . 

But now of course the top velo- 
city was more. 

The sudden wash of failure al- 
most made him physically ill. Faster 
than light travel — why, how dared 
they! 

But he didn’t have time to waste 
on that particular emotion, or indeed 
on any emotion at all. He felt time 
draining away from him and sat up 
straight again, looking around. At 
ninety-six you dare not do anything 
slowly, not even daydream. 

H e glanced at, and dismissed, Pro- 
cyon. They had tried Procyon 
lately — the ship would not be even 
halfway. They had tried almost 
everything. Even Epsilon Eridani and 
Groombridge 1618; even, far down 
past the probable good bets among 
the spectroscopic classes, 61 Cygni A 
and Epsilon Indi, a late and despair- 
ing try at Proxima Centauri (though 



they were very nearly sure it was 
wasted, the Alpha Centauri expedi- 
tion had detected nothing like viable 
planets.) 

There had been twenty-six of 
them in all. Three ships lost, three 
returned, one still Earthbound. Nine- 
teen were still out there. 

Marchand looked for comfort at 
the bright green arrow that marked 
where the Tycho Brahe rode its jets 
of ionized gas, the biggest of his 
ships, three thousand men and wom- 
en. It seemed to him that someone 
had mentioned the Tycho Brahe re- 
cently. When? Why? He was not 
sure, but the name stuck in his mind. 

The door opened and Dan Fleury 
walked in, glancing at the arrayed 
stars and ships and not seeing them. 
The chart room had never meant 
anything to Fleury. He scolded, 
“Damn it, Norman, you scared us 
witless! Why you're not in the hospi- 
tal now — ” 

“I was in the hospital, Dan. I 
wouldn’t stay. And finally I got it 
through Asa Czerny’s head that I 
meant it, so he said I could come 
home if I would stay quiet and let 
him look in. Well, as you see, I’m 
quiet. And I don’t care if he looks 
in. I only care about finding out the 
truth about FTL.” 

“Oh, cripes, Norm! Honestly, you 
shouldn’t worry yourself — ” 

“Dan, for thirty years you’ve nev- 
er used the word ‘honestly’ except 
when you were lying to me. Now 
give. I sent for you this morning 
because you. know the answer. I 
want it.” 

“ For God’s sake, Dan.” 

Fleury glanced around the room, 



FATHER OF THE STARS 



117 




as though he were seeing the glowing 
points of light for the first time . 
perhaps he was, Marchand thought. 

He said at last, “Well, there is 
something.” 

Marchand waited. He had had a 
great deal of practice at waiting. 

“There’s a young fellow,” said 
Fleury, starting over again. “He’s 
named Eisele. A mathematician, 
would you believe it? He’s got an 
idea.” 

Fleury pulled over a chair and 
sat down. 

“It’s far from perfect,” he added. 

“In fact,” he said, “a lot of people 
think it won’t work at all. You know 
the theory, of course. Einstein, Lor- 
entz-Fitzgerald, the whole roster — 
they’re all against it. It’s called — 
get this! • — polynomiation.” 

He waited for a laugh, hopelessly. 
Then he said, “Although I must say 
he appears to have something, since 
the tests — ” 

Marchand said gently and with 
enormous restraint: “Dan, will you 
please spit it out? Let’s see what 
you said so far. There’s this fellow 
named Eisele and he has something 
and it’s crazy but it works.” 

“Well — yes.” 

Marchand slowly leaned back and 
closed his eyes. “So that means that 
we were all wrong. Especially me. 
And all our work — ” 

“Look, Norman! Don’t ever think 
like that. Your work has made it all 
the difference. If it weren’t for you, 
people like Eisele never would have 
had the chance. Don’t you know he 
was working under one of our 
grants?” 

“No. I didn’t know that.” Mar- 



chand’s eyes went out to the Tycho 
Brahe for a moment. “But it doesn’t 
help much. I wonder if fifty-odd 
thousand men and women who have 
given most of their lives to the deep- 
freeze because of — my work — will 
feel the way you do. But thanks. 
You’ve told me what I want to 
know.” 

W hen Czerny entered the chart 
room an hour later Marchand 
said at once, “Am I in good enough 
shape to stand a smith?” 

The doctor put down his bag and 
took a chair before he answered. 
“We don’t have anyone available, 
Norman. There hasn’t been a volun- 
teer for years.” 

“No. I don’t mean smithed into 
a human body. I don’t want any 
would-be suicide volunteer donors, 
you said yourself the smithed bodies 
sometimes suicided anyway. I’ll settle 
for a chimp. Why should I be any 
better than that young fellow — 
what’s his name?” 

“You mean Duane Ferguson.” 
“Sure. Why should I be any better 
than he is?” 

“Oh, cut it out, Norman. You’re 
too old. Your phospholipids — ” 

“I’m not too old to die, am I? 
And that’s the worst that could hap- 
pen.” 

“It wouldn’t be stable! Not at your 
age; you just don’t understand the 
chemistry. I couldn’t promise you 
more than a few weeks.” 

Marchand said joyously, “Real- 
ly! I didn’t expect that much. That’s 
more than you can promise me now.” 
The doctor argued, but Marchand 
had held up his end of many a hard- 



118 



IF 




fought battle in ninety-six years, 
and besides he had an advantage 
over Czerny. The doctor knew even 
better than Marchand himself that 
getting into a passion would kill him. 
At the moment when Czerny gau- 
ged the risk of a smith translation 
less than the risk of going on arguing 
about it, he frowned, shook his head 
grudgingly and left. 

Slowly Marchand wheeled after 
him. 

He did not have to hurry to what 
might be the last act of his life. 
There was plenty of time. In the 
Institute they kept a supply of breed- 
ing chimpahzees, but it would take 
several hours to prepare one. 

One mind had to be sacrificed in 
the smith imposition. The man 
would ultimately be able to return 
to his own body, his risk less than 
one chance in fifty of failure. But 
the chimp would never be the same. 
Marchand submitted to the begin- 
nings of the irradiation, the delicate 
titration of his body fluids, the end- 
less strapping and patching and 
clamping. He had seen it done and 
there were no surprises in the pro- 
cedure . He had not known, 
however, that it would hurt so 
much. 

Ill 

T rying not to walk on his knuck- 
les (but it was hard; the ape 
body was meant to crouch, the 
arms were too long to hang com- 
fortably along his sides), Marchand 
waddled out into the pad area and 
bent his rigid chimp’s spine back in 
order to look up at the hated thing. 



Dan Fleury came toward him. 
“Norm?” he asked tentatively. Mar- 
chand attempted to nod: it was not a 
success, but Fleury understood. 
“Norman,” he said, “this is Sigmund 
Eisele. He invented the FTL drive.” 

Marchard raised one long arm 
and extended a hand that resisted 
being opened: it was used to being 
clawed into a fist. “Gongradula- 
zhuns,” he said, as clearly as he 
could. Virtuously he did not 
squeeze the hand of the young 
dark-eyed man who was be- 
being introduced to him. He had 
been warned that chimpanzee stren- 
gth maimed human beings. He was 
not likely to forget, but it was 
tempting to allow himself to con- 
sider it for a moment. 

He dropped the hand and winced 
as pain flooded through him. 

Czerny had warned him to expect 
it. Unstable, dangerous, won’t last 
had rumbled through his conversa- 
tion; and don’t forget, Norman, the 
sensory equipment is set high for 
you; you’re not used to so much 
input : it will hurt. 

But Marchand had assured the 
doctor he would not mind that, and 
indeed he didn’t. He looked at the 
ship again. “Zo tliads id,” he grum- 
bled, and again bent the backbone, 
the whole barrel chest of the brute 
he occupied, to stare at the ship on 
the pad. It was perhaps a hundred 
feet tall. “Nod, mudge,” he said 
scornfully. “De Zirian, dad was our 
firzd, zdood nine hoonderd feed 
dall and garried a dousand beople 
to Alpha Zendauri.” 

“And it brought a hundred and 
fifty back alive.” said Eisele. He 



FATHER OF THE STARS 



119 




didn’t emphasize the words in any 
way, but he said it quite clearly. 
“I want to tell you I’ve always ad- 
mired you, Dr. Marchand. I hope 
you won’t mind my company. I un- 
derstand you want to go along with 
me out to the Tycho Brahe.” 

“Why zhould I mind?” He did, of 
course. With the best will in the 
world, this young fellow had thrown 
seventy years of dedication, plus a 
handsome fortune — eight million 
dollars of his own, countless hun- 
dreds of millions that Marchand had 
begged from millionaires, from gov- 
ernment handouts. f rom the pennies 
of school children — tossed them all 
into the chamber pot and flushed 
them Into history. They would say: 
A nonce figure of the early twenty- 
first century, Norman Marchand, or 
Marquand, attempted stellar colon- 
ization with primitive rocket-pro- 
pelled craft. He was of course un- 
successful, and the toll of life and 
wealth in his ill-conceived venture 
enormous. However, after Eisle’s 
faster-than-light became practicable 
. They would say that he was a 
failure. And he was. 

W hen Tycho Brahe blasted off 
to the stars massed bands of 
five hundred pieces played it to its 
countdown and television audiences 
all over the world watched it 
through their orbiting satellites. A 
president, a governor and half the 
senate were on hand. 

When Eisele’s little ship took off 
to catch it and tell its people their 
efforts had been all in vain, it was 
like the departure of the 7:17 ferry 
for Jersey City. To that extent, 



thought Marchand, had Eisele de- 
graded the majesty of starflight. 
Yet he would not have missed it 
for anything. Not though it meant 
forcing himself as supercargo on 
Eisele, who had destroyed his life, 
and on the other smithed chimpan- 
zee, Duane Ferguson, who was for 
some reason deemed to have special 
privileges in regard to the Brahe. 

They shipped an extra FTL unit— 
Marchand heard one of the men call 
it a polyflecter, but he would not do 
it the honor of asking anyone what 
that meant — for some reason. Be- 
cause it was likely to break down, 
so spares were needed? Marchand 
dismissed the question, realizing that 
it had not been a fear but a hope. 
Whatever the reason he didn’t care; 
he didn’t want even to be here, he 
only regarded it as his inescapable 
duty. 

And he entered Eisele’s ship. 

The interior of Eisele’s damned 
ship was built to human scale, nine- 
foot ceilings and broad acceleration 
couches, but they had brought ham- 
mocks scaled to a chimpanzee torso 
for himself and Duane Ferguson. 
Doubtless they had looted the ham- 
mocks from the new ship. The one 
that would never fly — or at least 
not on streams of ionized gas. And 
doubtless this was almost the last 
time that a man’s mind would have 
to leave Earth in an ape’s body. 

What Eisele’s damned ship rode 
to the stars on in place of ionized 
gas Marchand did not understand. 
The whatcha-flecter, whatever the 
damned thing was named, was so 
tiny. The whole ship was a pigmy. 

There was no room for reaction

mass, or at least only for enough to 
get it off-Earth. Then the little 
black box — it was not really little, 
since it was the size of a grand pi- 
ano; and it was not black but 
gray; but it was a box, all right — 
would work its magic. They called 
that magic “polynomiation”. What 
polynomiation was Marchand did 
not try to understand, beyond listen- 
ing, or seeming to listen, to Eisele’s 
brief, crude attempt to translate 
mathematics into English. He heard 
just enough to recognize a few 
words. Space was N dmensional. 
All right, that answered the whole 
question, as far as he was concerned 
and he did not hear Eisele’s tortuous 
efforts to explain how one jacked 
oneself up, so, to speak, into a poly- 
nomial dimension — or no, not that, 
but translated the existing polynom- 
ial extensions of a standard 4-space 
mass into higher orders — he didn’t 
hear. He didn’t hear any of it. What 
he was listening to was the deep 
liquid thump of the great ape’s heart 
that now was sustaining his brain. 

Duane Ferguson appeared, in the 
ape’s body that he would never 
leave now. That was one more 
count of Marchand’s self-indictment; 
he had heard them say that the odds 
had worked against Ferguson, and 
his body had died in the imposition. 

As soon as he had heard what 
Eisele was up to, Marchand had 
seized on it as a chance for expia- 
tion. The project was very simple. 
A good test for Eisele’s drive, and a 
mission of mercy, too. They in- 
tended to fleet after the plodding, 
long-gone Tycho Brahe and catch it 
in mid-space . for even now, thir- 



ty years after it had left Port Ken- 
nedy, it was still decelerating to be- 
gin its search orbit around Groom- 
bridge 1618. As Marchand strapped 
himself in, Eisele was explaining it 
all over again. He was making tests 
on his black box and talking at the 
same time: “You see, sir, we’ll try 
to match course and velocity, but 
frankly that’s the hard part. Catch- 
ing them’s nothing: we’ve got the 
speed. Then we’ll transfer the extra 
polyflecter to the Tycho Brahe — ” 

“Yez, thanggs,” said Marchand 
politely, but he still did not listen 
to the talk about the machine. As 
long as it existed he would use it, 
his conscience would not let him off 
that, but he didn’t want details. 

Because the thing was, there were 
all those wasted lives. 

Every year in the Tycho Brahe’s 
deep freeze means a month off the 
life of the body that lay there. Res- 
piration was slowed, but it was not 
stopped. The heart did not beat but 
blood was perfused through a pump; 
tubes dripped sugar and minerals 
into the torpid blood, catheters car- 
ried wastes away. And Groombridge 
1618 was a flight of ninety years. 

The best a forty-year-old man 
could hope for on arriving was to be 
restored into a body whose biological 
age was nearly fifty — while behind 
him on the Earth was nothing but 
a family long dead, friends turned 
into dust. 

It had been worth it. Or so the 
colonists had thought. Driven by the 
worm that wriggled in the spine of 
the explorer, the itch that drove him 
on; because of the wealth and the 
power and the freedom that a new 



FATHER OF THE STARS 



121 




world could give them, and because 
of the place they would have in the 
history books — not Washington’s 
place, or even Christ’s. They would 
have the place of an Adam and an 
Eve. 

It had been worth it, all those 
thousands had thought when they 
volunteered and set out. But what 
would they think when they landed! 

If they landed without knowing 
the truth, if some ship like Eisele’s 
did not reach and tell them in mid- 
space, they would find the greatest 
disappointment any man had ever 
borne. The Groombridge 1618 expe- 
dition aboard the Tycho Brahe still 
had forty years to go on its original 
trip plan. With Eisele’s invention 
driving faster-than-light commerce, 
there would be a planet populated by 
hundreds of thousands of people, 
factories at work, roads built, the 
best land taken, the history books 
already into their fifth chapter . 
and what would the three thousand 
aging adventurers think then? 

Marchand moaned and shook, not 
entirely because the ship was taking 
off and the acceleration squeezed 
his rib cage down against his spine. 

W hen they were in the polyflec- 
ter’s grip he floated across the 
pilot room to join the others. “I vas 
never in zpaze bevore,” he said. 

Eisele said with great deference, 
“Your work was on the Earth.” 
“Vas, yez.” But Marchand left it 
at that. A man whose whole life was 
a failure owed something to human- 
ity, and one of the things he owed 
was the privilege of allowing them to 
over look it. 



He watched carefully while Eisele 
and Ferguson read their instruments 
and made micrometric settings on 
the polyflecter. He did not under- 
stand anything about the faster-than- 
light drive, but he understood that a 
chart was a chart. Here there was a 
doubly profiled representation of the 
course-line of the Groombridge 1618 
expedition. The Tycho Brahe was a 
point of light, some nine-tenths of 
the way from Sol to the Groom- 
bridge star in distance, which meant 
something under three-quarters of 
the way in time. 

“Mass detectors, Dr. Marchand,” 
said Eisele cheerfully pointing to the 
charts. “Good thing they’re not 
much closer, or they wouldn’t have 
mass enough to show.” Marchand 
understood: the same detectors that 
would show a sun or a planet would 
also show a mere million-ton ship if 
its speed were great enough to add 
sufficient mass. “And a good thing,” 
added Eisele, looking worried, “that 
they’re not much farther away. We’re 
going to have trouble matching their 
velocity now, even though they’ve 
been decelerating for nine years . 
Let’s get strapped in.” 

From the hammock Marchand 
braced himself for another surge 
of acceleration. But it was not that, 
it was something different and far 
worse. 

It was a sausage-grinder, chewing 
his heart and sinews and spitting 
them out in strange crippled shapes. 

It was a wine-press, squeezing his 
throat, collapsing his heart. 

It was the giddy nausea of a rol- 
ler-coaster or a small craft in a 
typhoon. Wherever it took them, the 



122 



IF 



stars on the profile charts slipped 
and slid and flowed into new posi- 
tions. 

Marchand, absorbed in the most 
crushing migraine of all but a cen- 
tury, hardly knew what was hap- 
pening, but he knew that in the 
hours they found the Tycho Brahe, 
after giving it a thirty-year start. 

IV 

T he captain of the Tycho Brahe 
was a graying, yellow-fanged 
chimp named Lafcadio, his brown 
animal eyes hooded with shock, his 
long, stringy arms still quivering 
with the reaction of seeing a ship — 
a ship — and human beings. 

He could not take his eyes off 
Eisele, Marchand noted, and looked? 
It had been thirty years in an ape’s 
body for the captain. The ape was 
old now. Lafcadio would be think- 
ing himself more than half chimp 
already, the human frame only a 
memory that blurred against the 
everyday reminders of furry-backed 
hands and splayed prehensile feet. 
Marchand himself could feel the 
ape’s mind stealing back, though he 
knew it was only imagination. 

Or was it imagination? Asa Czerny 
had said the imposition would not 
be stable — something to do with the 
phospholipids — he could not re- 
member. He could not, in fact, re- 
member anything with the clarity 
and certainly he could wish, and it 
was not merely because his mind 
was ninety-six years old. 

Without emotion Marchand rea- 
lized that his measured months or 
weeks had dwindled to a few days. 



It could, of course, be the throb- 
bing pain between his temples that 
was robbng him of reason. But 
Marchand only entertained that 
thought to dismiss it; if he had cour- 
age enough to realize that his life’s 
work was wasted, he could face the 
fact that pain was only a second- 
order derivative of the killer that 
stalked his ape’s body. But it made 
it hard for him to concentrate. It 
was through a haze that he heard 
the talk of the captain and his crew 
— the twenty-two smithed chimpan- 
zees who superintended the running 
of the Tycho Brahe and watched 
over the three thousand frozen bodies 
in its hold. It was over a deep, con- 
fusing roar that he heard Eiesle in- 
struct them in the transfer of the 
FTL unit from his tiny ship to the 
great, lumbering ark that his box 
could make fleet enough to span the 
stars in a day’s journey. 

He was aware that they looked on 
him, from time to time, with pity. 

He did not mind their pity. He 
only asked that they allow him to 
live with them until he died, knowing 
as he knew that that would be no 
long time; and he passed, while they 
were still talking, into a painful, 
dizzying reverie that lasted until — 
he did not know the measure of the 
time — until he found himself strap- 
ped in a hammock in the control 
room of the ship, and felt the added 
crushing agony that told him they 
were once again slipping through the 
space of other dimensions. 

“Are you all right?” said a fami 
liar thick, slurred voice. 

It was the other, last victim of his 
blundering, the one called Ferguson. 



FATHER OF THE STARS 



123 




Marchand managed to say that he 
was. 

“Were almost there,” said Fer- 
guson “I thought you’d like to know. 
There’s a planet. Inhabitable, they 
think.” 

F rom Earth the star called 
Groombrige 1618 was not even 
visible to the naked eye. Binoculars 
might make it a tiny flicker of light, 
lost among countless thousands of 
farther, but brighter, stars. From 
Groombridge 1618 Sol was not 
much more. 

Marchand remembered struggling 
out of his hammock, overruling the 
worry on Ferguson’s simian face, to 
look back at the view that showed 
Sol. Ferguson had picked it out for 
him, and Marchand looked at light 
that had been fifteen years journey- 
ing from his home. The photons that 
impinged on his eyes now had pause- 
ed to drench the Earth in the colors 
of sunset when he was in his seven- 
ties and his wife only a few years 
mourned . He did not remember 
getting back to his haccock. 

He did not remember, either, at 
what moment of time someone told 
him about the planet they hoped to 
own. It hung low around the little 
orange disk of Groombridge 1618 
- — by solar standards, at least. The 
captain’s first approximation made 
its orbit quite irregular, but at its 
nearest approach it would be less 
than ten million miles from the 
glowing fire-coal of its primary. Near 
enough. Warm enough. Telescopes 
showed it a planet with oceans and 
forests, removing the lingering doubts 
of the captain, for its orbit could 



not freeze it even at greatest re- 
move from its star, or char it at 
closest — or else the forest could not 
have grown. Spectroscopes, therm- 
ocouples, filarometers showed more, 
the instruments racing ahead of the 
ship, now in orbit and compelled 
to creep at rocket speeds the last 
little inch of its journey. The at- 
mosphere could be breathed, for the 
ferny woods had flushed out the 
poisons and filled it with oxygen. 
The gravity was more than Earth’s 
- — a drag on the first generation, 
to be sure, and an expense in foot 
troubles and lumbar aches for many 
more — but nothing that could not 
be borne. The world was fair. 

Marchand remembered nothing of 
how he learned this, or of the land- 
ing, or of the hurried, joyful open- 
ing of the freezing crypts, the awak- 
ening of the colonists, the beginning 
of life on the planet ... he only 
knew that there was a time when he 
found himself curled on a soft, warm 
hummock, and he looked up and 
saw sky. 

¥ 

T he protuberant hairy lip and 
sloping brows of a chimpanzee 
were hovering over him. Marchand 
recognized that young fellow Fer- 
guson. “Hello,” he said. “How long 
have I been unconscious?” 

The chimp said, with embarrass- 
ment, “Well — you haven’t been un- 
conscious at all, exactly. You’ve been 
— ” His voice trailed off. 

“I see,” said Marchand, and strug- 
gled up. He was grateful for the 
strength of the slope-shouldered. 



124 



IF 





short-legged body he had borrowed, 
for this world he had come to had 
an uncomfortably powerful grip. The 
effort made him dizzy. A pale sky 
and thin clouds spiraled around him; 
he felt queer flashes of pain and 
pleasure, remembered tastes he had 
never experienced, felt joys he had 
never known . With an effort he 
repressed the vestigial ape and said, 
“You mean I’ve been — what would 
you call it? Unstable? The smithing 
didn’t quite take.” But he didn’t 
need confirmation from Feguson. 
He knew; and knew that the next 
time he slipped away would be the 
last. Czerny had warned him. The 
phospholipids, wasn’t that it? It was 
almost time to go home . 

Off to one side he saw men and 
women, human men and women, on 
various errands and it made him 
ask: “You’re still an ape?” 

“I will be for a while. Dr. Mar- 
chand. “My body's gone, you know.” 
Marchand puzzled over that for 
a while. His attention wandering, he 
caught himself licking his forearm 
and grooming his round belly. “No!” 
he shouted, and tried to stand up. 

Ferguson helped him, and Mar- 
chand was grateful for the ape’s 
strong arm. He remembered what 
had been bothering him. “Why?” he 
asked. 

“Why what, Dr. Marchand?” 
“Why did you come?” 

Ferguson said anxiously, “I wish 
you’d sit down till the doctor gets 
here. I came because there’s some- 
one on the Tycho Brahe I wanted 
to see.” 

A girl? thought Marchand wond- 
eringly, “And did you see her?" 



FATHER OF THE STARS 



125 



“Not her, them. Yes, I saw them. 
My parents. You see, I was two 
years old when the Tycho Brahe 
left. My parents were good breeding 
stock — volunteers were hard to get 
then, they tell me — - oh, of course, 
you'd know better than I. Anyway 
they — I was adopted by an aunt. 
They left me a letter to read when 
I was old enough . Dr. Mar- 
chand! What’s the matter?” 

Marchand reeled and fell; he 
could not help it; he knew he was 
a spectacle, could feel the incon- 
gruous tears rheuming out of his 
beast eyes; but this last and un- 
expected blow was too harsh. He 
had faced the fact of fifty thousand 
damaged lives and accepted guilt 
for them, but one abandoned baby, 
left to an aunt and the apology of 
a letter, broke his heart. 

“I wonder why you don’t kill 
me,” he said. 

“Dr. Marchand! I don’t know 
what you’re talking about.” 

“If only,” said Marchand care- 
fully, “I don’t expect any favors, 
but if only there were some way I 
could pay. But I can’t. I have noth- 
ing left, not even enough life to 
matter. But I’m sorry, Mr. Ferguson, 
and that will have to do.” 

Ferguson said, “Dr. Marchand, if 
I’m not mistaken, you’re saying that 
you apologize for the Institute.” 
Marchand nodded. “But — oh. I’m 
not the one to say this, but there’s 
no one else. Look. Let me try to 
make it clear. The first thing the 
colonists did yesterday was choose 
a name for the planet. The vote was 
unanimous. Do you know what they 
called it?” 



Marchand only looked at him 
dully. 

“Please listen. Dr. Marchand. 
They named it after the man who 
inspired all their lives. Their great- 
est hero. They named it Marchand.” 
Marchand stared at him, and star- 
ed longer, and then without changing 
expression closed his eyes. “Dr. 
Marchand!” said Ferguson tentative- 
ly, and then, seriously worried at 
last, turned and scuttled ape-like, 
legs and knuckles bearing him rapid- 
ly across the ground, to get the ship’s 
doctor who had left him with strict 
orders to call him as soon as the 
patient showed any signs of life. 

When they got back the chimp 
was gone. They looked at the frond- 
ed forest and at each other. 

“Wandered off, I expect,” said 
the doctor. “It may be just as well.” 
“But the nights are cold! He’ll 
get pneumonia. He’ll die.” 

“Not any more,” said the doctor, 
as kindly as he could. “He’s already 
dead in every way that matters.” 
He bent and rubbed his aching 
thighs, worn already from the strug- 
gle against this new Eden’s gravity, 
then straightened and looked at the 
stars in the darkening western sky. 
A bright green one was another 
planet of Groombridge 1618’s, farth- 
er out, all ice and copper salts. One 
of the very faintest ones, perhaps, 
was Sol. “He gave us these planets,” 
said the doctor, and turned back 
toward the city. “Do you know what 
being a good man means, Ferguson? 
It means being better than you really 
are — so that even your failures car- 
ry someone a little farther to success 
— and that’s what he did for us. I 



126 



IF 



hope he heard what you were trying 
to tell him. I hope he remembers it 
when he dies,” the doctor said. 

“If he doesn’t,” said Ferguson 
very clearly, “the rest of us always 
will.” 

T he next day they found the 
curled-up body. 

It was the first funeral ever held 
on the planet, and the one that the 
history books describe. That is why, 
on the planet called Marchand, the 
statue at the spaceport has a small 



bas-relief carved over the legend: 
THE FATHER OF THE STARS 

The bas-relief is the shape of a 
chimpanzee, curled on itself and 
looking out with blind, frightened 
eyes upon the world, for it was the 
chimpanzee’s body that they found, 
and the chimpanzee’s body that 
they buried under the monument. 
The bas-relief and the body, they are 
ape. But the statue that rises above 
them is a god’s. END

The Place Where Readers 
And Editor Meet . 



Dear Editor: 

In my opinion If is at this mo- 
ment the best science fiction maga- 
zine on the market. It contains 
everything that I could possibly want 
in an S.F. magazine, big name au- 
thors who continue to write some of 
the best stories available, plus a con- 
tinuous supply of new authors who 
seem to be almost as good as the 
old reliable pros, also witty and in- 
formative editorials which seems to 
enhance the quality of the magazine. 
Put these all together, and they spell, 
in my opinion anyway, a great maga- 
zine. 

Just to make it plain that the pur- 
pose of this letter is not solely to 
butter you up, I have a complaint 
to make. It seems that through some- 
one’s fault I have not received the 
September issue of If. My first 
thought was that my subscription 
had run out, but on checking I 
found that I still had two issues of 
my sub still forthcoming. I hope 
that this mistake can be rectified 
soon, and my issue sent to me. I had 



especially wanted this issue since it 
contained the final installment of 
Robert A. Heinlein’s Farnham’s 
Freehold, but, aside from this slight 
mistake I have no other complaints 
to make, and in my opinion If is 
still the best S.F. magazines sold to- 
day. — Charles J. Bing, 711 Cen- 
ter Street, Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania. 
• Hope you discovered the explan- 
ation by now. We had to omit the 
September issue because of printing 
difficulties. But hopefully we’re 
straightened out now! — Editor.

Dear Editor: 

I happened to see you on the 
Johnny Carson Tonight show, and I 
must say that you helped add to 
the more respectful attitude shown 
today towards science fiction. I feel 
that the trend is gradually swinging 
over to the romantic type of read- 
ing and that it will continue to do 
so as long as Galaxy, Worlds of To- 
morrow, and If continue their re- 
markable output of entertaining and 
delightful science-fiction stories. The 
128 



success of any magazine depends on 
the editor. There couldn’t be any 
better editor than the one of the 
previously mentioned three maga- 
zines. 

As usual, the issue of If scored 
an excellent grade. Even though 1 
am relatively new to reading science 
fiction, I haven’t noticed one story 
published in If that did not measure 
up to its usually high standards. 
What I can’t understand is why this 
certain magazine (I wonder which 
one) wins the Hugo every year. But 
I’m sure of one thing: Keep up the 
good work and the Hugo award for 
the best science fiction magazine for 
1964 will certainly go to IF. — Cal- 
vin Cahan, 6306 Lafayette, Omaha,

Dear Editor: 

With your knowledge of recent 
science fiction, you can perhaps 
answer a question: In what anthol- 
ogy or magazine can I find again 
a wonderful S.F. yarn about dogs? 
If you ever saw it, you will remem- 
ber this plot. 

A space ship from a planet close- 
ly resembling Earth lands here. Its 
crew also closely resemble Earth 
people, so that they receive an en- 
thusiastic welcome and when ready 
to return to their home, their ship 
is loaded with gifts from Earth. 

Among the gifts are a pair of fine 
dogs for breeding stock, as their 
planet has no dogs. While the ports 
of the space ship are open and the 
crew is taking a farewell look at 
their Earth friends, one of the 
crew (a co-pilot?) informs the cap- 
tain that he understood the dogs’ 
thoughts and warns the captain about 



burdening their planet with these 
parasitic pests whose only thought 
is to cajole and flatter human beings 
into sheltering and feeding and 
cherishing them for life, and giving 
nothing in return. 

The captain ridicules the warning. 
He cannot read the dogs' thoughts 
himself and already the dogs are 
licking his hand and showing all the 
signs of servile affection that all 
dogs use. 

The co-pilot sees that his warning 
is useless and plans to get rid of the 
dogs before the ship arrives home. 
But as he stands near an open port, 
one of the dogs suddenly shoves 
him out and he suffers a fatal fall to 
Earth, a few hundred feet below the 
open port. 

I have searched through a dozen 
anthologies and can’t find it. I read 
it within the last three years, I’m 
sure. You may know of it. — Dab- 
ney Horton, 550 Main Street, North- 
port, New York.

Dear Editor, 

You are correct; If has, for the 
last two issues, done all you claimed 
it was trying to do . adventure, 
excitement, color, drama, etc. 

You might just as well leave out 
“Hue and Cry”, or at least cut i! 
down to never more than one and a 
half pages. Most of the letters are 
of more interest to you than to the 
readers (like this one). — Irvin 
Koch, 835 Chattanooga Bank 
Building, Chattanooga, Tennessee

Dear Editor: 

You run a fine magazine but your 
geography ain’t good. Potsdam is in 

129 




East Germany and not very far 
from Berlin. If I am in Potsdam, en- 
gineering a communication system, 
I am in trouble. And if that’s where 
you folks have been sending my mail, 
h is no wonder I have not heard 
from you. 

So please pass the word around 
that I am in Frankfurt am Main, in 
the German Federal Republic, a 
Part Of The Free World, and that 
I have never been, and am not now, 
affiliated with any organization, po- 
litical party, or anything else Period. 
— George O. Smith, Frankfurt am 
Main, West Germany. 

* * * 

Dear Editor: 

The March issue of If proved to 
be a quite a good one for two basic 
reasons. First, your all-Smith idea 
was good, and all the stories were 
of high quality. E.E. Smith’s The 
Imperial Stars was different from 
the usual If material, but I think 
that it could have been improved 
with more work. The Store of Heart’s 
Desires was the best story in the 
issue. It contained a plot that kept 
moving and only slowed up a few 
places. I like Cordwainer Smith’s 
underpeople, and I am looking for- 
ward to more stories from him. 

Secondly, do you always drop 
such bombshells so casually? The 
announcement that If was going 
monthly bowled me over. 1 can’t 
tell you how glad I am to hear it. If 
is really on the upswing. — Paul 
Gilster, 42 Godwin Lane, St. Louis, 
Missouri. 

* * * 

Dear Editor: 

Because I am a younger genera- 
tion reader of science fiction (I am 
130 



fifteen years old) I don’t know too 
much about the field as it was in its 
early days. I have read “Doc” 
Smith’s yarns, The Skylark of Space, 
Skylark Three and Skylark of Va- 
leron in recent paperback editions. 
They are pretty good stories, but I 
couldn’t help but visualize a long 
string of Skylark stories, each be- 
ginning with a new revival of Dr. 
Marc DuQuesne and ending with 
Richard Seaton adding another, 
larger spaceship to his collection and 
a red feather to his cap to com- 
memorate his mastery of another 
order of radiation. 

The other day I came upon an 
issue of If on the stands and was 
greatly surprised to read your an- 
nouncement concerning Skylark Du- 
Quesne. 

Good grief! How many Skylark 
stories have there been? — Bill 
Beck, 2210 Vassar Drive, Boulder, 
Colorado. 

* * * 

Dear Editor: 

If gets better by the issue. It 
couldn’t be better except (and here 
I go with my two cents worth) . .1) 
More Retief stories, please. 2) More 
illustrations by Finlay and Gaughan 
(who has improved a lot in the last 
few issues). 3) A book review co- 
lumn. 4) A story or so by Theodore 
Sturgeon wouldn’t be out of order. 
(And by the way, what happened to 
him? I didn’t see his name on the 
content’s page or any article by 
him.) 5) I would like to see stories 
by Clifford Simak, Robert Sheckley 
and the light-hearted side of Isaac 
Asimov. — Brian Baldwin, 212 
Harding Road, Chattanooga, Ten- 
nessee.

Forgotten road to success in writing 



By J. D. Ratcliff 

I can’t imagine why more beginners don’t 
take the short road to publication — by 
writing magazine and newspaper articles. 

I’ve made a good living for 25 years 
writing articles, and I’ve enjoyed every 
minute of it. I’ve interviewed Nobel Prize 
winners and heads of state. I’ve covered 
stories from Basel to Bangkok to Buffalo. 

It’s a great life. No commuter trains to 
catch, no office routine. Whether I’m at 
home or abroad on assignment, I write 
from eight to noon every day — no more, 
no less. My afternoons are my own. 

The market for articles is vast and hun- 
gry. Over 350,000 were sold last year to 
magazines alone. Editors want pieces on 
almost any subject that comes natural to 
you — but they demand that your writing 
be sound and professional. 

To teach professional writing techniques 
to serious beginners, I joined with Rod 
Serling, Faith Baldwin, Bennett Cerf, and 
eight other leading authors to start the 
Famous Writers School. 

We poured everything we know about 
successful writing into a new kind of 
course which trains you at horne, in spare 
time. You begin with the fundamentals of 
all good writing. Then, you specialize in 
articles and other non-fiction. (Or in Fic- 
tion, Advertising or Business Writing.) 

You learn to write by writing. Our in- 
structors, themselves all published au- 
thors, work with you by mail much as 
editors do with established writers. 

Our School is young. Yet students, many 
still in training, have broken into print' in 
more than 60 publications. Several sold 
pieces they wrote as School assignments. 



Writing Aptitude Test offered 

To find out if you too can be a published 
writer, send for the School’s revealing Apti- 
tude Test. If you test well — or offer other 
evidence of writing ability — you may enroll. 
However, there is no obligation to do so. 




“Jack” Ratcliff is one of America's highest paid 
free-lance writers. Although he works only 
four hours a day, he has had hundreds of articles 
published in top magazines, including over 
100 in Reader's Digest alone.
