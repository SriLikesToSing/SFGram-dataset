An exciting new concept

With his favorite illustrator, JAMES ODBERT, 
GORDON R. DICKSON has created . 



"(HOME FROM THE SHORE) , . not merely entirely new in publishing but 
in artistic concept. It has been, in the truest of senses, a collaboration 
between the artist and the author. What has emerged is not merely an 
illustrated story, not even a story with special illustrations carefully 
fitted to it. The two parts of the whole — art and story, art and fiction — 
are equal co-partners. The result is something more than a book. It is a 
mechanism for the imagination, a magic box that the reader can 
open and experience, putting himself or herself much more deeply 
into the life of the story than would otherwise be possible.”

A real post-Watergate president, yes sir! 
You’d never catch him going over the 
People’s heads. 



MARCH 12 , 1989 . 

“I . , 

It s really nothing new, the 

technician explained to the President 
of the United States. 

“We’ve always had a failsafe 
system for everything.” He hesi- 
tated, careful where to tread with 
his words. “Everything, that is, ex- 
cept for the possibility of human 
error in this office. There has al- 
ways been a chance of mistake by 
the President. We’ve lived with that 
flaw in the system for over thirty 
years. The Russians know it too. 
They might not agree but they know 
it could be a potential weakness.” 
The President was also careful in 
his choice of words. He was afraid 
of machines but he didn’t want to 
display that reaction to the techni- 
cian. “We must be absolutely cer- 
tain that mankind retains control of 
nuclear weapons. Can you be sure 
these machines of yours won’t take 
that control away?” 

“Mr. President, I assure you they 
won’t. This computer system will 
have your personal image imprinted 
within its memory banks. Four of 
your top advisors will also have 
their personal images in the system. 
The system, sir, will be you and 
they.” 

“Then why do we need the sys- 
tem?” 

“Picture this, sir. The Russians 
launch an attack. You have five 
minutes in which to respond. Can 



you gather your advisors and, using 
the human way, reach a decision 
with enough speed? It would be im- 
possible. In that situation the re- 
sponse would have to come from 
one man — yourself. It would be 
made in confusion and in a great 
hurry. And, sir, I hesitate to say 
this, but there is always the chance 
that you would not be emotionally 
capable of pushing the button.” The 
technician squirmed a bit at this last 
point, afraid that he had gone too 
far. 

But the President only nodded 
slowly, unwilling to display any de- 
gree of enthusiasm for the techni- 
cian’s idea. 

“The computers, Mr. President, 
will make their decision when you 
key them into action. The decision 
will be based upon your personal 
image, as programmed, minus emo- 
tional response. An emotionless fin- 
ger on the button, sir, but your fin- 
ger just the same.” 

“What sort of computers are 
these?” 

The technician, warmed to his 
subject, leaned forward in his chair. 
“The sytem has been in use in air 
and spacecraft since the nineteen 
seventies. It’s called a computer 
jury. Five computers vote on a de- 
cision. The majority rules. It’s as 
simple as that, sir. If the vote is 
three computers to two, the minor- 
ity is automatically over-ridden by 
the majority. Decisions are nearly 



HUNG JURY 



7 




instantaneous with questions and 
votes. The system cannot fail.” 

‘‘And what are the odds against 
the computer majority making the 
wrong decision?” 

“I wouldn’t venture a guess on 
that, sir. Perhaps our Data File Four 
thousand could work the problem 
if — ” 

‘‘No need for that.” The Presi- 
dent waved the technician away. 
“Go ahead. Install the system.” 

may 15 , 1989 . 

The technician, tugging nervously 
on his watchband, waited for the 
President’s answer. 

The President, folding his hands, 
looked back at the technician with 
disbelief on his face and amazement 
in his eyes. “You want to test the 
system using my computer image 
and those of my advisors? Test it 
under simulated conditions?” 

Horvath, the technician, nodded, 
a bead of sweat forming on his right 
temple. He had not anticipated this 
sort of reaction from the President. 
The system was nearly operational. 
All it needed was the programming 
and testing and it would be ready. 

“It has to be done, sir! There’s 
no oth — ” 

“Absolutely not!” The Presi- 
dent’s fist pounded the desk top. 
“My God, Horvath! Have you any 
idea of what would happen if the 
outcome of that little test ever 
leaked to the public? Or to the Rus- 
sians?” 

“I have a top-security clearance 
rating, sir. Only you and I would 
have to be present for the test.” 

“I wouldn’t even trust you with 
that sort of information, Horvath. 

8 



The Russians know we have this 
system already, you can bet on it. 
And this system was supposed to be 
top-secret too.” 

Horvath shrank from the Presi- 
dent’s voice. 

“Imagine, Horvath, if the Rus- 
sians somehow managed to obtain 
the results of your little test. What 
if the results displayed an iron-fisted 
retaliation to a nuclear venture on 
their part? They’d know, Horvath. 
They’d know they would have to 
strike now, right away! Before your 
computers are operational. Because 
they would never have such an op- 
portunity again. Once your comput- 
ers are operational, there would be 
no doubt about our response to an 
attack. And doubt, Horvath, is what 
keeps the cold war cold.” 

Horvath stuttered and said 
weakly, “But . .” 

“Or what if our computers tested 
the other way?” the President fired 
back, not allowing the technician 
any breathing space. “What if they 
voted not to retaliate, based upon 
my advisors’ decisions programmed 
into the machines? Then if the Rus- 
sians found that out, they’d attack 
us for certain.” 

“We still need a test, sir. With- 
out it, the system isn’t failsafe.” 

“No! I don’t even want to know 
how my advisors would vote in the 
case of war. Once I knew, I might 
be tempted to rearrange the com- 
puter jury according to my own 
thoughts on the matter. I’m sorry. 
Test the system if you must, but 
don’t use me or my advisors as test 
subjects. Select five of your own 
men for the test run. I can’t allow 
you or anybody else to know for 
certain how we would respond to 



GALAXY 




an enemy attack.” The President 
smiled at Horvath and leaned for- 
ward in his chair. “I’ll tell you a 
secret, Horvath,” he said kindly. ‘‘I 
actually don’t know how I’d re- 
spond either. But then, that’s the 
job of the computer, isn’t it?” 

Horvath, not wishing to be 
banished from the President’s favor, 
wilted and quit the battle. “I sup- 
pose you’re right, sir. There has 
always been a danger of leaks from 
the White House. If this leaked, it 
would present the Russians with an 
interesting subject for scrutiny. 
We’ll test the system ourselves.” 

President Lyman breathed a sigh 
of relief as Horvath departed the 
Oval Office. He really didn’t know 
how he would respond to a nuclear 
attack. And he didn’t really want to 
know. 

The President traced a circle on 
his scratch pad, absently breaking 
the pencil point. He shrugged fi- 
nally and went back to work. 

june 6, 1989 . 

Soviet Premier Lastovik drummed 
fingers on the Kremlin table as the 
Minister of Psychology urged his 
case. Ten generals listened intently 
to the talk of computers, politics, 
ihe make-up of men and war. 

Lastovik stopped the psychologist 
in mid-sentence. 

“Have you checked with this 
Krukov in the Ministry of Sci- 
ence?” 

“Da.” 

“An honest politician?” 

“Indeed.” 

“It will be enough?” 

The psychologist nodded.

leagues in the military have a ques- 
tion?” 

Silence surrounded the table. 

‘‘Then we have them!” Las- 
lovik’s fist crashed on the table top. 
“We have them!” 

July 4, 1989 . 

The President was awakened by 
Jackson, his military aide. He 
brushed Jackson’s hand from his 
shoulder and, sitting up in bed, 
glanced at his watch. It was 4 a.m. 

“Yes?” 

“norad has bogies on the big 
screen, sir. sac and tac confirm. 
They want release of their weapons, 
Mr. President. General Trenton says 
this is the real thing. They’re mis- 
siles, s‘ir.” 

The President’s stomach turned 
queasy with fear. He shook his head 
abruptly and reached for the com- 
puter outlet at his nightstartd. 

Matching the outlet key with one 
that hung from his neck, he acti- 
vated the computer system installed 
just months ago by the technician. 

Then he and the military aide 
bolted for the elevator leading to the 
White House bomb shelter. 

The computers voted. 

Two computers, representing 
dovish advisors, sided against re- 
lease of weapons on the grounds 
that survival of humanity, either 
Russian or American, was of 
greater importance than war or its 
outcome. 

Two computers, representing 
hawkish counsel, voted for release 
of weapons, hoping that quick re- 
taliation might prevent a second 
Russian strike. 

President Lyman’s computer 
failed to make the first vote and 

10 



was still undecided by the fourth 
vote. 

Seconds ticked by. 

The tie-vote persisted, unbroken, 
Lyman's computer abstaining while 
it puzzled over the question’s an- 
swer. 

The computer “knew” Lyman 
better than he knew himself. Lyman 
was an honest politician, the com- 
puter understood, a man who truly 
believed himself to be the appointed 
representative of three hundred mil- 
lion people. Lyman never made an 
important decision without first con- 
sulting the people. Lyman always 
did what the people wanted. 

What did the people want? What 
would their response be? 

The other computers pushed a 
vote once more. Unlike Lyman’s 
machine, they represented only their 
advisors, who represented only 
themselves. 

The vote was tied again. 

Then Lyman’s computer, repre- 
senting a President who represented 
three hundred million Americans, 
made a decision, finally. 

Insufficient data. It did not know 
what the wishes of a majority of the 
citizens of the United States were 
concerning the question at hand. 

And Lyman, the computer knew, 
never made a big decision without 
knowing where the people stood. 

insufficient data. It flashed on 
the computer outlet video tube on 
the President’s nightstand. 

The computer decided to do no- 
thing. 

The other computers voted again. 
And again. And again. 

Hung jury. 

The Russian missiles fell. 

There was no return volley. ★

MILLENNIUM 



Davy moved the coffeepot closer 
to the coals with his toe. The wind 
was cold where it found its way 
through a crack between two logs. 
Have to chink that tomorrow. Davy 
had had all of the cracks chinked 
but some were always falling out. 
The storm outside was still build- 
ing, though the winds were already 
blowing a gale. Rain thundered 
down on the corrugated metal roof. 
He looked again, but there were no 
leaks; he had pitched the last one a 
week earlier. 

Patrick Singer moaned in his 
sleep. Davy’s eyes sought him out 
in the dimness. The fireplace shed 
the only light in the one-room 
cabin. Again Davy’s father muttered 
but it was unintelligible. 

“I should get Michael or Sarah to 
sit with him tomorrow night,” 
Davy thought. He had hardly slept 
for three nights now, since Pa had 
taken the fever. The doctor could 
do nothing, or said he could not. 
You could never be sure with a 
Gentile. 

The thought almost made Davy 
smile. He had been a professing ag- 
nostic for six months now but his 
prejudices still made him side with 
his own people, misguided as he 
now believed them to be. 

No, he would not get Michael’s 
help yet. There was no reason he 
could not catnap; after all, the doc- 

TO GO NOT GENTLY 



tor had said there was nothing any- 
one could do. It was only a matter 
of time. And he had no intention of 
placing himself in Michael’s obli- 
gation, no matter how hard it be- 
came to take care of Pa. Michael 
already blamed him for Pa’s condi- 
tion, saying that his defection had 
taken the heart out of the old man. 

But it was seventy years of 
dredging a bare living out of the 
unyielding Ozark soil that had killed 
him — was killing him. Not anything 
Davy had done. He knew that and 
someday he might thank Michael 
for turning what might have become 
guilt into less harmful anger. Some- 
day, but not now. 

The coffeepot gurgled and Davy 
poured himself a cup of the steam- 
ing liquid. Chicory. He had de- 
veloped a taste for real coffee at 
school but there was no affording it 
now. 

He ought to wash Pa’s face again 
but somehow he couldn’t bring 
himself to disturb the old man. 
While he slept, he was in less pain. 
Davy let the bitter brew slip down 
his throat. 

It was never easy, being a 
youngest son. When his brother 
Michael had been his age, there had 
been an older brother (Patrick, Jr., 
now dead) and Davy to help, and 
Pa had been younger and stronger. 
And Ma had been alive to give all 



13 




their labor some meaning. But Pat 
was dead, Ma was dead, Pa was 
dying and Michael had married and 
moved away. Therein lay the only 
consolation left to Davy — that he 
did not have to put up with 
Michael’s sneering superiority. 

The work that fell on Davy was 
too much and the farm was falling 
into disrepair. He no longer planted 
the highest hectares, and weeds 
grew around the place, but there 
were only so many hours in the day 
and once it had taken all of them 
just to do what he did now. And 
now he had to tend to Pa too. 

There was a momentary lull in 
the storm before the rain struck the 
roof with redoubled fury, accom- 
panied by the bell-like thrumming 
of hail. Patrick Singer cried out: 

“Anne!” 

But there was no Anne Singer to 
comfort him any more. Davy felt 
the first stirring of tears. Pa would 
not last out the night. 

And the last six months of his 
life had been a torment . and it 
was all Davy’s fault. 

The chicory was forgotten, grew 
cold in the cup, as Davy’s mind 
skittered back down the days. 

* * * 

Davey and his father could hear the 
singing begin as they crossed the 
meadow. Slanting against the ver- 
dant hillside, rays of the setting sun 
fell over the Gulf of Texas, and 
below, the seaport of Little Rock 
sent up a foulness that seldom 
reached these heights. 

It was somehow symbolic of the 
Millennium that men should work 
on as though nothing untoward had 



happened, blissfully unaware that 
the Reign had already begun; obliv- 
ious to the fact that the outpour- 
ings of their pointless labor could 
not reach or unsettle the Elect. 
Once the thought had given Davy a 
feeling of superiority — but of late 
he had been drawn increasingly to- 
ward those very same fleshpots. 

The church was of stone and 
logs, built with more care than most 
of the members’ own houses. In 
winter an oil-drum stove made it a 
pleasant refuge against the damp 
and fog of the Ozark Islands, and 
often in summertime the elders 
would built an arbor of poles, 
roofed with chicken wire and 
rushes. There the services would 
proceed by the afterglow of the set- 
ting sun, occasionally enlivened as 
bats chased junebugs among the 
crowded aisles. 

Now it was late fall. The leaves 
clung forlornly to the jackoaks, 
dead and sere. The oil-drum stove 
had brought the temperature up and 
Davy shed his jacket gratefully. 

The Singer cabin and farm was 
five kilometers west of the meeting- 
house. The Singers could neither 
fertilize nor irrigate, the latter be- 
cause of inclement geography, the 
former for reasons of doctrine that 
had never been clear to Davy. Life 
had been easier before his brothers 
left to make lives of their own. Of 
course he and his father could have 
taken jobs in Little Rock — but the 
Elect did not mingle with the Gen- 
tiles. 

That is, they did not except when 
compelled by law. Four mornings a 
week Davy walked down to the 
town for compulsory schooling. His 
was the first generation since the 



14 



GALAXY 




Tribulation to do so. Despite legal 
battles waged by the church hierar- 
chy, the resurgent Federal govern- 
ment had stood fast on the subject 
of compulsory education. 

There was some singing, some 
prayer, and then the Reverend Pow- 
ell stepped up to the podium, slap- 
ping down his Bible and darting his 
eyes from face to face. He opened 
the book, announcing the seventh 
chapter of Revelation, a text that 
Davy did not need a Bible to re- 
member. 

After this I beheld, and, lo, a 
great multitude, which no man 
could number, of all nations, 
and kindreds, and people, and 
tongues, stood before the throne, 
and before the Lamb, clothed 
with white robes, and palm 
leaves in their hands. 

Only the Gentiles still doubted 
that the Cataclysm had been Ar- 
mageddon, or that the years fol- 
lowing had been the Great Tribula- 
tion. Davy could not appreciate the 
fear that the Revelation of St. John 
had struck into Fundamentalist con- 
gregations like this one before the 
Cataclysm. Even the saintly John’s 
description of blood running to the 
“depths of a bridle bit” could not 
rival the reality of nuclear war, nor 
were the “beasts” loosed in the last 
days anything but pale reflections of 
the mutations that had plagued the 
earth these last two centuries. 

And one of the elders an- 
swered, saying unto me. What 
are these which are arrayed in 
white robes? and whence came 
they? 



And I said unto him. Sir, thou 
knowest. And he said to me, 
These are they which came out 
of the Great Tribulation, and 
have washed their robes, and 
made them white in the blood of 
the Lamb. 

Vaguely Davy wondered what it 
would have been like to have heard 
those same verses with Armageddon 
before him and without the certainty 
that he was among the white-robed 
Elect. 



Therefore are they before the 
throne of God, and serve him 
day and night in his temple: and 
he that sitteth on the throne shall 
dwell among them. 

They shall hunger no more, 
neither thirst any more; neither 
shall the sun light on them, nor 
any heat. 

For the Lamb which is in the 
midst of the throne shall feed 
them, and shall lead them unto 
living fountains of waters: and 
God shall wipe away all tears 
from their eyes. 

Davy had recently come across 
an ancient book in the archives of 
the school library that described the 
pre-Tribulation Fundamentalist sects 
and included transcripts of sermons 
preached before the last days. There 
he found these same scriptures 
quoted in descriptions of the Mil- 
lennium to come. But people had 
taken them literally, and Davy 
could today attest that even in the 
Millennium a man still hindered 
and thirsted, and the Lamb fed men 
as he always had — by providing 



TO GO NOT GENTLY 



15 




seed and soil, rain and sun. The 
rest, as always, was up to man. 

Reverend Powell shut his Bible 
and Davy’s attention wandered, al- 
though he was careful to look at- 
tentive, as always. His mind slipped 
naturally into well-worn paths of 
perplexity. There were vast con- 
tradictions between the teachings of 
the church and the teaching he re- 
ceived at the federal school, con- 
tradictions he could not resolve; but 
what was worse, those contradic- 
tions had heightened his sensititivy 
to other contradictions within his 
religion. The difference between 
Revelation’s description of the Mil- 
lennium and the reality he perceived 
was one, but there were other, more 
pressing, problems. How, for in- 
stance, could a God who was both 
all powerful and entirely loving 
have allowed Armageddon to take 
place? 

Davy did not know that he was 
posing the age-old mystery of om- 
nipotence and omni-benevolence 
coexisting in an imperfect world. 
Nor did he recognize the question 
thus posed; his education had been 
rudimentary at best. He only knew 
that there was something seriously 
wrong with the beliefs of his elders. 

Davy had always been close to 
his father and was free to ask his 
advice on any question but this. In- 
stinctively he shied away from ver- 
balizing his uncertainty, knowing 
that it was one subject with which 
Pat Singer could not cope. Two de- 
cades later, when time and death 
had utterly sundered them, Davy 
would recognize this inability as his 
father’s immovable defense against 
disbelief. 

“Just the other day a man from 



Little Rock stopped me on the 
street.” Some change in the rhythm 
of Reverend Powell’s delivery 
caught Davy’s ear. “He said to me, 
‘Powell. Powell, how can you call 
this the Millennium when you Mil- 
lennialists spend your whole lives 
dragging a bare living out of the 
soil?’ Then he quoted to me these 
same scriptures you just heard. 

“Brothers and sisters, 1 tell you 
no Christian ever quoted scripture 
half so well as the Devil. 

“I said to him, ‘Mr. Jones, there 
are times to be clever but question- 
ing God’s word is never clever. I 
don’t know why God chose to 
speak to us using physical terms in 
the scriptures but I know that I 
never hunger after righteousness, 
nor thirst after truth. He dwells with 
me every day, here in the temple of 
my heart, and He has cleansed me 
in living fountains of grace. He 
feeds me on His word and, Sir, He 
has wiped every tear from my eye; 
and I rejoice in His daily presence!’ 

“What care I if my belly is 
empty, if my heart is full? And 
what care I if God’s enemies twist 
His words, taking symbolic state- 
ments as literal truth? What care I if 
they hurl lies in my face, as long as 
1 have truth in my heart?” 

A chorus of “Amens” followed 
as Powell broke off on a high note. 
He paused artfully, leaning across 
the podium, letting silence fill the 
room; then he went on more softly. 

“The Devil is wily and tireless. 
Even now, chained in the bottom- 
less pit, he still influences the un- 
wary. This poor man, whom I have 
called Mr. Jones, was not satisfied. 
Brothers and sisters, the Devil is 
never satisfied. 



16 



GALAXY 




“He said to me, ‘Powell, if God 
is all loving and all powerful, why 
did He allow the Cataclysm and the 
pestilence of mutations that fol- 
lowed?’ 

“Brothers and sisters, the Devil 
is clever. He asks telling questions; 
be sure, he is no fool. 

“I said, ‘Mr. Jones, I don’t 
know.’ ” 

His voice had fallen to a whisper, 
but no ear missed a word. “ 7 
don’t know. But God knows, Mr. 
Jones,’ I said. ‘I’m only a man. I 
don’t know why God does what He 
does, but I know that it is to my 
ultimate good. And how do I know? 
Because God loves me. He said in 
His Book that He loves me and I 
believe Him.’ 

“That’s faith, brothers and sis- 
ters. Faith. It’s faith that raises man 
above the animals and faith that 
raises Christians above the Gentiles. 
But if I could understand every- 
thing, how could I have faith? If I 
understood, why would I need God? 

“I rejoice in my frailty, my ig- 
norance, for only through it do I 
know the glorious feeling of utter, 
childlike faith in my Father.” 

He raised his hands and the con- 
gregation rose to sing. Davy rose 
with them, his heart pounding. 

He could not believe. All his life 
he had accepted, passively, but he 
could not believe, actively. To do 
so was to deny self, to deny his 
own value and importance, and this 
he could not do. Rather, he would 
not. 

And in the very moment that he 
refused belief, all the paradoxes and 
perplexities in his mind stood re- 
vealed, solved. What had seemed 
monolithic and absolute when view- 



ed from within was shot through 
with idiocy and honeycombed with 
rot when viewed from without. The 
superstructure of doctrine crashed 
down around him in one warm 
moment of knowing. 

It was all lies. 

There was no Millennium; there 
had been no Armageddon — there 
were only madmen in conflict. 
There was no God. There was only 
man and his frailty reaching out for 
eternal life in the face of irrevoka- 
ble death. 

With assurance so utter that it 
thrilled him to the core even as it 
stripped him of all defense, Davy 
Singer knew — knew ! — that there 
was only himself and death, black 
death, waiting at the end of the 
corridor of his life. 

* * *• 

Light slanting through the cabin 
window awoke Davy. He had begun 
the night in remembrance; then he 
had slept; and now he was uncertain 
when the remembering had ceased 
and the dreaming had begun. 

The months following his nega- 
tive conversion had been difficult. 
He had told his father somewhat of 
his new feelings, trusting him to 
understand partially at least, but in 
that he had underestimated his 
father’s needs. There had been no 
understanding, just bitter recrimina- 
tions. 

Shaking sleep from his mind, he 
rose and went to check on his 
father. Patrick Singer was dead. 

It took several seconds for the 
enormity of the event to sink in and 
then Davy hesitantly pressed his ear 
against the old man’s chest. There 



TO GO NOT GENTLY 



17 




was no heartbeat; no sound of 
breath. 

Davy backed away from the bed, 
tom between the need to run for a 
doctor and his unwillingness to 
leave his father. But as he regarded 
the open eyes and slack mouth, he 
realized that it did not matter. He 
could go or stay — but the dead stay 
dead. 

He reached out to close his 
father’s eyes. The flesh was still 
warm and he drew his hand back 
quickly. Uncertain, he tapped the 
aged cheek lightly. The head rolled 
sideways on lax muscles and Davy 
drew back again, spasmodic shivers 
overtaking him. 

He reached out once more; found 
that he could not touch that dead, 
warm skin again, and pulled the 
blanket over his father’s head in- 
stead. 

Firmly believing in the Millen- 
nium, the old man had worked his 
life away, knowing scant rewards 
for all his labor. Believing in an 
afterlife, he had died secure. But he 
was just as dead as any atheist 
would have been . just as dead 
as Davy himself would someday be. 

Somehow Davy had vaguely ex- 
pected a great revelation at this in- 
evitable moment, some sign that his 
agnosticism was merely the foolish- 
ness of youth. He had secretly 
hoped for just such an omen; but 
there was nothing — just an empty 
dried-up husk and the lonely sound 
of wind moaning about in the 
eaves. 

There were tears then, hot and 
stinging, but there was something 
more too — the beginning of a slow 
burgeoning terror that would pursue 
him throughout his life.

REBIRTH 



1 

Tasmeen interrupted .Dave in 
midmorning. He was indulging in his 
favorite position — lounging in a de- 
crepit armchair in the comer of the 
lab — reading a journal, his bare feet 
on the windowsill. 

“Someone to see you in your 
office. Professor.” 

“Send him in here.” 

“I think you had better go to 
him,” she replied, eyeing the disor- 
der with mock distaste. Dave 
shrugged, slipped into sandals and 
followed her. 

The reason for Tasmeen’s un- 
usual solicitude was soon apparent: 
Dave’s visitor was in a wheelchair. 
He was a small-featured and hand- 
some man, with a sober air, and the 
lap robe did nothing to disguise his 
legless condition. 

“Professor Singh, this is Sri Nir- 
ghaz Husain. Sri Husain, Professor 
Ram David Singh.” 

Dave did namaste, touching his 
hands together before his chest and 
bobbing his head in a greeting, 
which Husain returned. 

“What can I do for you, Sri Hu- 
sain?” 

Husain looked faintly embarras- 
sed. “I was told that you are the 
Director of the Institute.” 

Dave nodded. “Yes, although 
that may not entail all that you 
think.” 

He pulled up a chair and sat 
down facing Husain. Tasmeen re- 
turned with a tray of tea and bis- 
cuits. 

“Now, Sri Husain, you have to 

GALAXY 




understand what it is to be the di- 
rector of this Institute. We are all 
researchers here and need no one to 
tell us what to do; the director sim- 
ply shuffles paperwork and sees to 
it that the rest have money to work 
with. That’s it. Each one of us 
takes his turn as director on a bi- 
yearly rotation and my term of ser- 
vitude is up within a few days. 
After that Professor Mukerjee will 
be director, poor man.” 

Husain smiled despite himself. 
“You are not an Indian?” 

“NorAm by extraction, Indian by 
citizenship and inclination.” 

“But still NorAm in your infor- 
mality.” 

Dave smiled. “Perhaps. What 
can the Institute do for you, Sri Hu- 
sain?” 

Husain’s brows came together 
and he hesitated. Then, “I under- 
stand that you are on the forefront 
of regeneration research?” 

Suddenly Dave understood the 
man’s reticence. “Your legs?” 
“Yes.” 

“I’m sorry, Sri Husain, but I 
doubt that there is anything we can 
do for you. If we were able to re- 
generate human parts, you can be 
sure that it would be on all the 
news channels. We are working to- 
ward that end, and one of our 
members feels that she may be 
fairly close to it, but the techniques 
have not yet been proven.” 

“I am willing to take a chance, 
Doctor Singh, if the odds are at all 
favorable. To be so confined is in- 
tolerable.” 

Dave leaned back, drumming his 
fingers. Then he called out to Tas- 
meen. She put her head in the 
doorway and he said, “Ask Doctor 



Mathur to step in if she can break 
away.” 

When she had gone, he turned 
back to Husain. “As I said, my role 
as director is a small one. Doctor 
Mathur is the expert on regenera- 
tion. You must understand, how- 
ever, that our purpose here is to 
find techniques with which to over- 
come sterility. Regeneration re- 
search is directed primarily toward 
that end.” 

Shashi Mathur stepped in mo- 
ments later with a smile for 
Dave — which she quickly hid. Prop- 
er British formality lives on in 
India long after Britain is but a 
memory. 

Dave introduced them and she 
said, “Sri Husain. Sri Nirghaz Hu- 
sain?” 

He nodded. Dave looked blank. 
“Sri Husain is a famous polo 
player,” Shashi prompted. Dave 
noticed her momentary' hesitation 
over tense. “He is also the grand- 
son of Sri Karji.” 

Suddenly a light dawned. The 
Premier, Jogendranath Kantikar — 
Sri Jogendranath Kantikarji when 
the honorifics were added. Out of 
affection and practicality, his fol- 
lowers had shortened it to Sri Karji. 
His grandson, Nirghaz Husain — 
now confined to a wheelchair — had 
been the chief negotiator for India 
in its disputes with Medina over the 
land recovered by the Panch-ab 
project. 

Dave’s embarrassment was writ- 
ten across his face and Husain 
chuckled. “I thought that seques- 
tered men of science were purely 
fictional.” 

“No, I’m afraid that we are very 
real,” Dave admitted. He studiously 



TO GO NOT GENTLY 



19 




avoided newscasts, but the more 
spectacular stories always managed 
to trickle through his defenses. 

Nirghaz Husain was the son of 
Sri Karji’s youngest daughter and a 
Muslim father, Parivar Husain. The 
daughter had left home at an early 
age, creating a scandal that Sri 
Karji’s Parlimentary opponents 
would not let die. She had returned 
to India with her son after the 
Medinan Muslims had made life 
intolerable for her. Her son had 
gone back to Medina upon his 
father’s death to inherit his fortune 
and to act as an unofficial emissary 
between Sri Karji and the Muslims. 
He had been there when the fighting 
broke out six months ago and had 
lost his legs to a bomb dropped by 
an Indian plane. 

“Professor Mathur,” he said now, 
“Professor Singh informs me that 
you are the expert on regeneration. 
My grandfather has said many fine 
things about your Institute; he 
suggested that I come here seeking 
aid.” 

Dave and Shashi exchanged 
glances. There had been nothing 
casual about dropping Sri Karji’s 
name. If they succeeded in restoring 
Husain’s legs, the sky would be the 
limit in financing for future re- 
search; but should they fail .... 

“I’m sorry, Sri Husain, but there 
is nothing we can do for you,” 
Shashi told him gently. “Our ef- 
forts here are aimed primarily at 
overcoming the worldwide drop in 
birthrate hollowing the Cataclysm. 
Only a few of us, Such as Doctor 
Singh and myself, are pursuing 
lines of research in other areas of 
biology, and primary regeneration is 
not one of them.” 



“But Doctor Singh said that you 
were working on regeneration.” 

“Yes and no. Let me explain. 
We have had some success with 
primary regeneration where the 
matrix of tissue was not entirely de- 
stroyed. Consider the amputation of 
an arm, say between the elbow and 
the wrist. We could cause all of the 
muscles of the forearm to regenerate 
and we could then replace the bone 
with metal. But the hand? The fin- 
gers? There would be no matrix for 
their regeneration. In certain cases 
of limited avulsion we use this 
technique, but it would have no 
value to you. 

“Furthermore, we have isolated 
hormones that cause ‘stunted 
growth’ so that today we are able to 
give treatment to a child whose 
limbs do not fully develop; but full, 
primary regeneration in living hu- 
mans is impossible, at least within 
the forseeable future. It has to take 
place in the embryonic stage.” 

Husain’s expression hardened as 
though he were unwilling to believe 
her words. 

“What I am doing is experi- 
menting with the growth of re- 
placement parts from clones,” 
Shashi explained. 

“Clones?” 

She smiled. “Except for sperm 
and ova, every cell contains the ge- 
netic pattern of the entire organism. 
Certain lower orders, sponges for 
example, reproduce by budding off 
of ordinary cells. The new or- 
ganisms produced are genetically 
identical to the parent organism. We 
can artificially stimulate ordinary 
muscle cells to replicate new or- 
ganisms in a similar way among the 
higher orders. 



20 



GALAXY 




“For example, we take cells from 
a donor rat, clone them, and grow a 
new rat identical in every sense to 
the original. Whole limbs from the 
clone can then be transplanted sur- 
gically to the original.” 

“Can you do that with humans?” 
“No, not yet, nor any time in the 
reasonably near future. The prob- 
lems involved are staggering.” 

“Nor are all the problems scien- 
tific,” Dave pointed out. “Consider 
the rats. They are in every way 
identical; if they were human, what 
right would a man have to steal a 
part from his clone?” 

“Also,” Shashi went on, “if that 
were not a problem, consider the 
fact that in order to produce a clone 
with a body of your present age, it 
would require about twenty years of 
growth, by which time you would 
be forty. To be practical, cloning 
for replacement purposes would 
have to begin its growth at the time 
of the subject’s birth.” 

“Have human clones been 
raised?” Husain asked. 

Shashi nodded. “In China — be- 
fore the Cataclysm — there were re- 
ported to have been human clones 
raised by implantation in uteri. It is 
even told that a clone of Chairman 
Mao was raised, but that story is 
probably apocryphal. Since the 
Cataclysm, experiments with clones 
have been common. There are at 
present at least one hundred clone- 
conceived persons in India alone, 
some of whom are nearly thirty 
years old.” 

Husain was shocked. “I had no 
idea!” 

“It isn’t exactly, top secret but it 
is not yet publicized. We think that 
such cloning may be a stop-gap 



measure over the next several gen- 
erations — until we solve the birth- 
rate problem.” 

“Then you could actually make a 
clone from my cells?” 

“Yes, but if we did, it would 
merely provide you with a son, not 
a new set of legs. And that son 
would look and be no different from 
any other child, except that he 
would be your genetic twin. He 
might not even resemble you 
closely as he grew; environment has 
its effect too.” 

* * * 

Dave turned to Shashi after Hu- 
sain had left. “You lied to him 
pretty badly.” 

“You mean Choudry’s forced- 
growth enzyme? Why should I get 
his hopes up over an untried 
technique? Anyway, forced growth 
doesn’t overcome the moral prob- 
lems.” 

Dave stared at the door through 
which Husain had exited. 
“Perhaps.” 

Shashi studied him, disturbed by 
the implications of his speculative 
tone.

t hung in a void. 

There was no sound, no light, no 
change of temperature and no 
gravity, it had hung thus since its 
birth, so that it knew nothing other 
than its self. Physically it existed; 
mentally it had never left the womb. 

An umbilical cord brought it air 
and sustenance and the enzymes 
that forced its growth. And that 
growth was phenomenal — three 



TO GO NOT GENTLY 



21 




weeks from birth to physical matur- 
ity. 

Dave turned away from the me- 
ters on the sensory-deprivation tank 
and checked the readings on the 
computer. Nearby, in another tank, 
a bottle-nosed dolphin named Baba 
lay half-in and half-out of the 
water, narcotized and attached to an 
umbilical cord similar to that at- 
tached to the sensory-deprivation 
tank. 

Dave made final checks all 
around and then fed a narcotic to 
the already mindless dolphin; it was 
needless now — but it would help his 
transition to sentient life. He closed 
a switch. There was a hum as other 
banks of machinery went into play, 
but the moment was largely unre- 
markable. The machinery utterly 
stripped the dolphin Baba of mem- 
ory. 

In the process, he died. 

Dave confirmed that fact — and 
then opened the sensory-deprivation 
tank. For the very first time, light 
impinged upon the dolphin named 
Baba II. 



* ★ * 

Dave was playing games with 
Baba II when Shashi came in later 
that afternoon. The dolphin 
frolicked about the large tank, en- 
tirely unaware that he had, in one 
sense, been living for only a few 
hours. 

Dave greeted Shashi as she 
touched his hand and leaned down 
to stroke the dolphin’s head. Then 
she froze in mid-gesture, staring at 
it; the tattoo that had identified the 
creature no longer adorned its 



forehead. Drawing back, she looked 
at Dave with a mixture of wariness 
and shocked admiration. 

“You did it!” 

“Yes.” 

“And Baba is . dead?” 

He shook his head. “Transmi- 
grated. Baba’s memories reside now 
in the brain of Baba II. Baba II is 
Baba, brain and bone.” 

Shashi watched in wonder as the 
creature shot about the tank. She 
herself had cultured the clone that 
now swam before her, and she had 
assisted Dave in the surgery that 
had implanted the foetus in a dol- 
phin host mother. Raised from birth 
in a sensory-deprivation tank, it had 
had no memories and no personality 
of its own until now. 

“Baba— the original Baba — is 

dead?” 

Dave nodded, unconcerned, and 
then said, “Watch.” 

For twenty minutes he put Baba 
II through his paces and the dolphin 
responded beautifully, threading the 
intricate maze of wires and mirrors 
with their innumerable turnings and 
false leads. Dave had spent months 
in training Baba in that maze and it 
was one that no creature, however 
intelligent, could have traversed 
without error except through prior 
experience. 

But Baba’s memories now re- 
sided in Baba II, and since Baba 
II’ s body was a clone from Baba, it 
was identical in every genetic par- 
ticular. By heredity and environ- 
ment, Baba II was Baba, outwardly 
differing only in the slight pallor of 
II’ s skin and his lack of Baba’s 
identifying tattoo. 

After his run through the maze. 
Baba II came for his reward of fish

and remained to be fondled. As 
Shashi scratched him in all his 
favorite places, she realized that the 
situation would have been uncanny 
except that the illusion that this was 
the original Baba was so convincing 
that she could not react emotionally 
to the situation. 

She and Dave left the laboratory 
at sunset, walked past the open 
stalls of Poona, buying chappatis 
and tea in an insulated container, 
and went on up to the park. There 
they sat quietly until the sky faded 
and those few stars that could com- 
pete with the city lights emerged. 
The air was chill and Shashi drew 
close to Dave; yet she seemed 
somehow restrained. 

“What’s wrong?” he asked her. 

“Baba. I am deeply troubled by 
the implications of your experiment 
with him.” 

“I didn’t kill Baba. I know you 
were fond of him; so was — am — I, 
but he is as alive tonight as he was 
this morning. Only his address has 
changed.” 

The faint attempt at humor failed. 
“I didn’t mean that. I know I made 
a pet of him, but if he had to die, 1 
wouldn’t cry. I said that I am trou- 
bled by the implications, not the 
actuality, of what you have done.” 

“Meaning?” 

“Meaning what happened to 
Baba’s atmanT' 

“You don’t really believe in that 
crap?” 

“Yes, I do.” 

There was little he could say in 
the face of such calm assertion and 
he swallowed his irritation. “That 
which made Baba Baba was trans- 
ferred from one body to the next. 
His atman, if you want to use that 



term, is what was transferred.” 

“No, Dave. You know better 
than that. His soul, perhaps; you are 
the expert on Christian theology, 
not I. But not his atman. I know 
that I have led many previous lives, 
but do 1 remember them? No. The 
atman which is my essence, which 
goes with me from life to life, is 
not memory.” 

Dave shrugged, unwilling to 
argue theology. His knowledge of 
Hinduism was considerable but he 
could never hope to debate it with a 
native. Or a believer. It irritated 
him to think that Shashi could cling 
to what seemed to him to be super- 
stition. More important, those be- 
liefs might hamper his work — and 
his work was a matter of life and 
death. 

“What will you do next?” she 
asked.

“With Baba, nothing. Since we 
are not yet at a clinical stage, it 
would prove nothing to repeat the 
transference to still another body. 
What 1 have to do next is to chose a 
short-lived but fairly intelligent crea- 
ture and make a transference from 
an aged individual to a young 
clone.” 

“In search of immortality?” 
“Yes,” he replied tightly. “I 
also have to follow up some leads 
on sensory-deprived clones as 
donors for organ transplants.” 

A troubled look crossed her face 
in the dim moonlight. He turned to 
her. “You are thinking of Husain?” 
She nodded. “Forget it,” he said. 
“By the time we get our techniques 
ironed out, Husain will be an old 
man.” 

“I know.” 

He moved closer to her. She had 
changed from lab coveralls to a 
flowing sari which did little to 
hamper his motions in the sweet 
darkness. 



Shashi Mathur had been married 
at twelve, consummated at fourteen. 
She had lived with her husband, a 
man of thirty-five, until she was 
sixteen. At that point she had turned 
her sexual attentions elsewhere, 
trying to let no fertile night pass 
without a bedmate, preferably a 
new one each month. In so doing, 
she was merely following the cus- 
toms of the time. When births are 
rare, they are precious, and who 
can say what lucky coupling might 
prove fertile? 

When Shashi was seventeen, her 

24 



husband died. By that time she was 
convinced that she was barren. In 
that she was merely ordinary. Faced 
with the prospect of an empty fu- 
ture, she took her meagre inheri- 
tance, left for Bombay and enrolled 
in one of the dozen prep schools 
that surround Deccan University. 
Now she was twenty-eight, certain 
of her barrenness, and working re- 
ligiously to overcome that bane for 
her fellows. 

As a professor, a widow and a 
kshatriya, she enjoyed high status 
and a rare freedom from constrict- 
ing gossip. Her quarters were fur- 
nished with an utmost simplicity. 
She had a small brazier where she 
kindled a charcoal fire on those 
nights when the monsoon drove 
chill and dampness through the 
walls' and windows. She often brew- 
ed tea there for herself or her 
guests, but never cooked. There 
were stalls of sweet-wallas within a 
five-minute walk, and she had her 
main meals at the Institute cafeteria. 

Her single room was unfurnished 
save for cushions and a foam sleep- 
ing-pad. By day this was propped 
against a bare inner wall. Block- 
printed Madrasi hangings adorned 
the walls and thick rush mats cov- 
ered the floor. A carved chest held 
her clothing. There was a row of 
books against one wall; the Gita, 
Vivekananda’s works, Tagore’s 
poetry. She kept her professional 
books strictly segregated in her 
office at the Institute. 

By the light of candles, with in- 
cense sticks burning, she lit the 
brazier and made oblations to Agni. 
Then she settled into the lotus posi- 
tion. 

Later, after her meditations, and 
GALAXY 




after she had extinguished the 
lights, her mind strayed back to 
Ram Singh, a name she preferred to 
the ridiculous ‘Dave,’ and his un- 
natural playing with the structure of 
reality. 

* * * 

The summons came at noon the 
following day. “Sri Singhji?” The 
messenger bowed from the waist 
and Dave felt an irrational irritation 
at the obeisance. Messages prof- 
fered with the double honorific, 
prefix and suffix, usually meant 
trouble. It read: 

Sri Kantikar of Bombay would 
appreciate your presence at his 
bungalow on Tagore Street at 
eight p. m., on the night of the 
twenty-fifth, to discuss a matter 
of mutual interest. 

. J. K. 

For a moment Dave was too 
stunned to take in the implications. 
So the Premier wanted to see him 
personally. And unofficially too — to 
judge from the fact that he signed 
the message without reference to his 
office. Dave had never met nor had 
any dealings with Sri Karji; he had 
never seen him except for news- 
casts. It could only concern his 
grandson. 

Dave had known that Husain had 
not dropped his grandfather’s name 
casually. Cold sweat formed on his 
face as he studied the note. 

Ill 

Bombay was the world’s most 
modern city in both the best and the 



worst senses of the word. The cap- 
ital of India since New Dehli’s in- 
undation, it housed an impressive 
neo-Ashokan capitol complex sur- 
rounded by a buffer-and-expansion 
zone of parks. Beyond that the city 
was aggressively utilitarian. 

Even as early as the Cataclysm, 
India had been short of construction 
timber, although it supplied much 
of the world’s decorative 
hardwoods. Adobe, rammed earth 
and stone were her building mate- 
rials for centuries and still were — 
but with a difference. Now adobe 
bricks were made in huge factories, 
chemically stabilized and force 
dried. Rammed -earth walls were 
also chemically stabilized and made 
by special hydraulic rams and 
molds. Human labor was no longer 
a cheap commodity and with de- 
clining population, it would become 
more scarce as time passed, but 
electricity was plentiful from fusion 
reactors. 

Stone had long been a major 
building material, but it too required 
massive inputs of human labor to 
quarry and lay. Now stone was 
quarried mechanically as gravel and 
fused into monolithic blocks in situ 
at a tremendous cost of power. All 
public buildings were of this mag- 
mastone, as were dams, the houses 
of the rich, public monuments and, 
of course, the great dykes of the 
Ganga and Panch-ab projects. 

Dave debarked at Tagore station, 
skirted the power plant and strode 
toward Kulin Hill. His route took 
him through the Avenue of Abomi- 
nations, where beggars from the 
whole of Maharashtra gathered. 
Some were normal enough, a few 
were amputees and accident or dis- 



TO GO NOT GENTLY

ease victims, but by far the majority 
were mutants. Unable to compete 
with their normal fellows and of 
execrable status (Sri Karji called 
them the “new untouchables” and 
begged Congress to pass laws pro- 
tecting them, all to no avail), they 
were reduced to living on public 
pity. One was eyeless, an unbroken 
expanse of skin rising from his 
rudimentary nose to his hairline; 
another had a shriveled third arm 
projecting like a grotesque lingam 
from between her breasts; 
another .... They cried out to him 
as he passed, their arms waving 
upward from their lotus positions 
like anemones. 

Kulin Hill rose like a tower of 
sanity. From its heights the city 
took on a certain geometric beauty 
as distance hid her less graceful as- 
pects. The summit was surrounded 
by a ten-meter-high magmastone 
wall, pierced infrequently by small 
gates, and only the onion-domed 
turret that served its residents as an 
observation post was visible from 
the ground outside. 

Out in the harbor, ships’ lights 
were being switched on while deep 
beneath their keels, lost in the cold, 
wet darkness of the sea bottom, Old 
Bombay lay. One could take an ex- 
cursion submarine to visit the ruins 
but Dave had always found the idea 
depressing. 

The house within the wall was a 
disappointment. It was a faithful 
rendition of Indian architecture, but in 
magmastone and bitudobe it simply 
did not have the grace of Arjuna or 
Chitradurga. Of all the cities in 
India, Bombay was the least Indian; 
everything was a modern copy of 
past glories and thus lacked the 



charm of the old and the boldness 
of the new. Even Poona, the Mecca 
of the modern Indian, still retained 
its old quarter. 

He was led through the cavernous 
mansion and up the winding, open 
stairway to the observation tower. 
Here, beneath the dome in a 
glass-walled room whose clear 
panels had been thrown open to 
admit the night air, sat Sri Karji. 
He was lounging in a rattan peacock 
chair, surrounded by a scattering of 
manila-bound reports. 

A tea service sat on a cart nearby 
and he responded to Dave’s 
namastee by waving him to a chair. 
A servant materialized to serve the 
tea and chutneys and Sri Karji 
withheld conversation until they 
were alone. Somewhere within the 
house a sitarist was playing Raga 
Rageshri, an evening raga. 

“It was good of you to come, Sri 
Singhji.” 

“It was good of you to ask me.” 

“How have you liked India?” 

Dave put on a smile he did not 
feel. “Really, one does not ask that 
question of a native. I am a citizen, 
you know.” 

“Yes. Since last October, was it 
not?” 

Dave nodded, having no doubt 
that Kantikar knew the exact date 
and anything else he felt would be 
useful. It was some relief to be a 
citizen of the Indian Common- 
wealth; at least he could not be de- 
ported. 

Shot, but not deported. 

“We have a number of scientists 
from other countries working in our 
universities. They bring a welcome 
change of orientation that often 
bears well on our problems. One 



26 



GALAXY 




should always try to maintain a 
fresh viewpoint. Many of our visit- 
ing scientists eventually ask for 
asylum, especially those from Af- 
rica and the Andean Republic, and 
we never turn them away. How- 
ever, we do not normally grant 
them citizenship, for political 
reasons.” 

‘‘Of course,” Dave murmured. 

“You present a new situation. 
We have not found training in 
NorAm to be adequate, so I was 
surprised to find that one of our top 
scientists at the Institute was a 
North American.” 

“I took my graduate training at 
Deccan.” 

“So I discovered. You have risen 
high.” 

Condescension disguised as 
praise. The civilized man speaking 
to the barbarian. What you really 
mean, old man, is that / am vulner- 
able. 

Dave shrugged modestly. 

“I understand that you have met 
my grandson?” 

“Yes. A sad case; perhaps in 
twenty years medicine can help 
him.” 

Kantikar changed the subject 
abruptly. “I understand that you are 
an agnostic — at least so it said on 
your application for citizenship. Yet 
were you not raised as a Pentecos- 
tal-Baptist?” 

Despite himself, Dave gave 
grudging respect for the man’s un- 
abashed highhandedness. As Pre- 
mier, his power was virtually unlim- 
ited and he apparently saw no ad- 
vantage in hiding the fact, save be- 
hind a thin facade of courtesy. 

“A Millennialist,” Dave replied. 
“There are minor doctrinal dif- 



ferences between the two.” 

“But you cast all that aside?” 
“Yes, when I was fifteen.” 

“So I surmised after reading your 
article in the Deccan Monitor." 

“I hope you don’t rely on that 
article as an index of my sophisti- 
cation. I wrote it for the school 
paper in my first year at Deccan 
and my command of NaiHind was 
anything but complete.” 

Kantikar waved the protest aside. 
“The sense of your arguments came 
through despite any inadequacies of 
language. You believe that both the 
Christian concept of soul and the 
Hindu concept of atman are in 
error?” 

“Yes.” 

“And that the only thing that 
exists is biological drive tied to ex- 
perience — ‘tied by cords of mem- 
ory’ was your felicitous phrase, I 
believe.” 

“Yes.” 

“An old idea — not that you 
claimed it was not. But you carried 
it further by saying that if a man’s 
biology could be replicated by 
parthenogenesis — cloning — and his 
memory transcribed, he could attain 
virtual immortality.” 

Tired of playing parrot, Dave 
said nothing. 

“Once again, not a new idea. 
Yet you go on to say that man’s re- 
ligions have cheated him out of 
immortality by making him accept 
the idea of death; that these 
techniques of ‘physiological resur- 
rection’ would have been perfected 
centuries ago had men really be- 
lieved in their mortality.” 

Kantikar paused with an air of 
expectation but Dave simply shrug- 
ged once more. “You seem well 



TO GO NOT-6ENTLY 



27 




versed in what I wrote. I see no rea- 
son to enlarge upon it,” he said. 

“Such a philosophy must make a 
man quite desperate. To think that 
immortality is at hand but to fear 
that he might not be able to perfect 
its techniques before he dies — r do 
not envy you.” 

* * * 

It was some hours later that the 
conversation turned serious again. 
Throughout dinner Kantikar had 
refused to be drawn ‘into any but the 
most trivial discussions and later he 
had been intent on the musicians 
and the Kathak dancers. Finally, as 
they sat . back in rattan lounges on 
the terrace watching the moon on 
Bombay harbor and listening to the 
distant sound of Kantikar’s resident 
sitarist playing in the courtyard 
below, each with a small waterpipe 
of gunga spreading its mild narcotic 
through their systems, Kantikar re- 
turned to the discussion. 

“Doctor Mathur told my grand- 
son that one reason she could not 
provide him with replacement limbs 
was that it would take twenty years 
to grow them. Yet my aides have 
discovered an article by Professor 
Choudry of your Institute that indi- 
cates that clone growth can be 
forced to many times its normal 
rate.” 

Dave was cautious in his reply. 
“We have had some success along 
those lines with laboratory ani- 
mals.” 

“And human clones?” 

“We have not attempted it with 
human clones.” 

“Yet if you did try it and failed, 
what harm would come? The human 

28 



from whom the clone cells were 
taken would be entirely unaf- 
fected.” 

“True. But we are not sure that a 
limb, its growth forced, would not 
adversely affect the donor after a 
transplant. Also, there is the moral 
aspect.” 

“That should prove no problem 
for you.” 

“Sir?” 

Kantikar paused, gazing up at the 
moon, and then went on: “It is 
your philosophy, avowed in the ar- 
ticle we discussed earlier, that 
memory is the only ‘soul’ a man 
has. A clone grown to maturity in a 
sensory-deprivation tank would have 
no memory and could therefore be 
used as a donor — with as much 
immunity from moral censure as a 
cadaver. That is your philosophy, is 
it not?” 

Dave felt the trap closing and yet 
he did not regret it. It was a step 
that had to be taken eventually and 
if Kantikar ordered it, the blame 
would be his should public opinion 
rise in protest. 

“By the way, how is Baba II 
doing?” 

Dave actually grinned. “Well,” 
he said and then added, “There is 
no guarantee that Baba II will not 
die tomorrow from some unforeseen 
complication, and that risk would 
run even higher for Husain.” 

“At this preliminary stage, we 
need not worry about that. When 
the time comes to take risks, we 
will all review the situation together 
and decide what is best.” 

“Will you send him by tomor- 
row?” Having come this far, Dave 
saw no point in further verbal spar- 
ring. 



GALAXY 




“To begin cloning? Very well, 
but he can stay only an hour. He is 
leaving for Medina on a mission of 
utmost delicacy.” 

Dave was suddenly aware of 
greater depths of machination than 
he had suspected. “You aren’t just 
the doting grandfather, are you? 
You want to show the Muslims that 
they can be outdone. Nirghaz’s 
crippling by Indian bombs was a 
major diplomatic blunder, wasn’t 
it?” 

Kantikar’s eyes were cold. 
“That, Singhji, is none of your 
business.” 

IV 

Husain donated a cell sample 
which Shashi cultured for cloning. 
Developing a human clone was not 
greatly different than developing an 
animal clone and the apparatus of a 
mechanical womb could be set up 
quickly. The sensory-deprivation 
tank was another matter, however. 
It had to be larger and more sophis- 
ticated, but such tanks had been 
built before. It was a job requiring 
no new technology. 

During the first five weeks of 
gestation no growth stimulants were 
used, but by that time a completion 
date for the sensory deprivation tank 
was reasonably certain and the 
Choudry enzymes were released 
into the fluid in which the embryo 
floated. A month later and the 
foetus had reached four kilos in 
weight and Dave, with Shashi’s aid, 
transferred the infant to the tank 
that had held Baba II, carefully sev- 
ering the fleshy umbilical and re- 
placing it with a mechanical one 
that fit the orifices of the head. 



* * * 

“Quite well,” Dave replied to 
Husain’s query. “Couldn’t be bet- 
ter, in fact. The clone is in the sen- 
sory-deprivation tank that housed 
one of our test animals and it will 
remain there until the larger tank is 
completed. We aren’t pushing its 
growth as much as we might be- 
cause we don’t want it to outgrow 
its present home before a new one 
is ready.” 

Nirghaz Husain bobbed his head 
in tense delight. It was obvious that 
he was only now allowing himself 
to hope. He had returned from 
Medina the day before after long 
and fruitless negotiations with the 
Muslims. 

Dave wheeled him into an 
examination room and said, “Nir- 
ghaz, this is Doctor Choudry. In 
addition to being the man who de- 
veloped the growth stimulant, he is 
also an accomplished surgeon, 
which neither Doctor Mathur nor I 
are.” 

Dave and Choudry lifted Husain 
onto the examining table, where 
Shashi unbuttoned his gown with 
asexual efficiency. 

Dave drew a deep breath and 
held himself still. He had no bed- 
side manner with which to cover 
this situation. Shashi turned away, 
but Choudry went on with admira- 
ble calm. “You did not inform us 
that your genitalia had also been 
lost.” 

“Amputated. Like the legs, they 
were too crushed to save.” Husain 
glanced away but the expression in 
his eyes was hard and bitter. “So 
they said.” 

“Hmm.” 



TO GO NOT GENTLY 



29 




Without looking up, Husain 
asked, “Is there any chance of 
transplanting that too?” 

“Dammit, man, don’t spring a 
question like that on me out of thin 
air. I don’t know,” Choudry re- 
plied. 

Husain’s belly and buttocks were 
a webwork of scar tissue and his 
body terminated in a blank ana 
lumpy mass. Choudry probed and 
measured and then sent Husain 
away for x-rays. 

* * * 

In the dimly lit office Choudry 
had taped a dozen x-rays, taken 
from all angles, on a battery of 
viewing boxes. He sat hunched over 
one, overlay paper and ruler in his 
hand, measuring, checking angles 
and occasionally pausing to calcu- 
late. He had been at it for better 
than an hour and Dave and Shashi 
had finally given up following the 
complexities of his work. They 
perched hip to hip on a desktop 
across the room, sharing coffee. It 
looked bad. 

At last Choudry laid his 
paraphernalia aside and stretched, 
shaking his head. “No way.” 

“I can’t believe it,” Dave said. 
“Here we were prepared to use the 
latest techniques and even an en- 
tirely new donor source and we 
can’t proceed simply because our 
surgery isn’t up to it!” 

“Let me put it this way, Ram. If 
he were lying on the table now as a 
fresh amputee and we had the parts 
available, I would try it. We would 
have nothing to lose because he 
would have only a slim chance of 
living either way. Frankly, 1 don’t 
know how he managed to live. You 

30 



can be sure that the abdominal cav- 
ity was wide open; they certainly 
had to push his viscera back as they 
sutured.” 

Shashi shook her head. “Why 
did they go to such lengths for an 
Indian?” 

“Politics,” Dave fairly snarled. 
“The fact that Nirghaz was injured 
by Indian bombs was a diplomatic 
coup for the Medinans. Had he 
died, it would have soon been for- 
gotten but now he is a walking — I 
mean a living — monument to Indian 
aggression.” 

“All of which doesn’t help him 
or us one bit,” Choudry went on. 
“Look at this. The left articular 
fossa is completely gone and the 
ilium has been trimmed. The head 
of the right femur is still in place 
and fused into the fossa. Any trans- 
plant would have to begin above 
that point and include the entire 
pelvic girdle. Surgery just isn’t up 
to it.” 

“So who’s going to tell him?” 

* * * 

Dave did not go directly to speak 
with Nirghaz; instead he went to his 
lab, where Baba II greeted him with 
insistent snortings that stopped only 
when Dave scratched his head and 
tossed him a chunk of fish. 

Science, Dave knew, proceeds by 
fits and starts, not so much because 
research is quixotic (although it is), 
but because a man can invent or 
discover only what mankind is 
ready for. Leonardo da Vinci’s 
model helicopters were proof of 
that. 

Had the time come? It was a del- 
icate question concerning not so 
much the state of the art as the 



GALAXY 




spirit of the times. He had Sri 
Karji’s support. There was money 
and power there; and in this state of 
near war, the label of “military se- 
cret” would amply cloak his work 
from the public. 

But not from his colleagues. He 
still had not convinced Shashi of the 
un-humanness of a sensory-deprived 
clone, and Choudry had been hesi- 
tant. Would they have balked — in 
the final analysis — at cutting up a 
seemingly live and healthy human 
being for transplant purposes despite 
the fact that that human being was 
“merely” a clone? He was not 
sure. However, it loomed as a large 
possibility that they would have in- 
tervened with the transplant proce- 
dure even if medical reasons had 
not precluded it. 

Or had they? Had Choudry delib- 
erately misread the x-rays? No 
matter; either way, this new course 
of action was better for Husain. 
And humanity. 

And himself. 

He went down to the waiting 
room. Nirghaz had given up the 
pretense of reading while he waited 
and now he looked up intently at 
Dave’s entrance. 

“Can it be done?” 

Dave stared at Husain for a long 
time before answering, “No, not by 
surgery. But . .” 

V 

Baba ii shot across the tank, 
ducked under a bar and through a 
ring, described a complex spiral 
around a horizontal rod, doubled 
back — and faltered. Confused, he 
floated free for a moment, then 
rushed across the tank for a piece of 



proffered Fish and a scratch on the 
snout. 

Sri Karji straightened up and 
shook his head. “An impressive 
display, 1 suppose, if I knew what it 
meant.” 

Dave slapped the dolphin on the 
side and said to Kantikar, “That is 
just the problem. You impressed me 
so much in our First interview that I 
assumed your spies had been 
thorough. They were not or you 
would know that what you just wit- 
nessed is the reason we have to 
have the Deliac computer. Your 
spies told you, correctly, that Baba 
II could thread a complex maze, 
using the original Baba’s memories. 
What they did not tell you was that 
we trained Baba in five separate 
mazes. Baba II can do three of 
them perfectly, one not at all and 
the other one only part way before 
faltering.” 

“So your experiment was not a 
perfect success, as you said it 
was.” 

“Tom told me that my experiment 
had succeeded, not vice versa. And 
I assumed that your information was 
complete. In fact, the experiment 
succeeded admirably, and we know 
why it failed and the exact dimen- 
sions of its failure. We took every 
memory that Baba could give us in 
one burst of energy before she died. 
Had we taken the memories in in- 
crements and stored them in a com- 
puter bank, we could have had them 
all. 

“But we did not have such a 
computer because of budgetary 
limitations. When you gave me the 
commission of rejuvenating Nir- 
ghaz, I assumed that you knew that 
the computer was necessary.”

Kantikar stared, unseeing, at the 
frolicking dolphin. It was always 
galling to be outdone by a com- 
petitor; and to be caught up by 
one’s own failings was doubly 
humiliating. Worse, it made all of 
his efforts to date useless unless he 
could came through on this latest 
demand. Of course it could be 
done. Anything, legal or illegal, 
could be done. But every such ac- 
tion left him open to attack and 
there were always those who were 
ready to pull down Sri Karji. 

Nor should he divert even a frac- 
tion of his country’s energies from 
the upcoming struggle for survival. 
The Deliac computer was an auxil- 
iary set-up in the Deliac Air Force 
complex south of Poona. It was 
presently not being used but it 
might be needed on short notice. 

Yet there was a debt to pay; and 
there was his affection, and there 
was his guilt. For it was Sri Karji 
who had ordered the airstrikes 
against Mahmet, knowing full well 
that his grandson was there but 
confident in the odds that the young 
man would emerge unhurt. It had 
meant surprise and it had given him 
a reputation for putting the good of 
the state above his personal inter- 
ests. But the price ... it was one 
thing to calculate chances be- 
forehand and quite another to find 
oneself the loser afterward. 

Nor had the airstrikes ended the 
Medinan menace; if anything, they 
had stiffened resistance. 

It was bad enough that Nirghaz 
must regain his legs in a way so 
unorthodox that it smacked of 
heresy. Transplants were one thing; 
the transference of memory was 
another. Still, if Nirghaz were will- 

32 



ing, how could he, Kantikar, hold 
back? 

“I will give the orders,” he told 
Dave curtly. 

After Kantikar and his entourage 
had left, Shashi found Dave leaning 
on the edge of the dolphin tank, his 
face lined and worried. As always, 
she was both drawn to and troubled 
by his iron control, so different 
from other men she had known. 
Even other NorAm men had not 
been like this. She had a brief vi- 
sion of a creature trapped inside a 
drum of steel, crying out for atten- 
tion, for understanding. What was 
that creature like? After two years 
of liaison with Ram David, she still 
could not truly say. 

‘‘Did you pull it off?” 

Dave nodded and then shook his 
head. He staggered slightly as he 
moved across the room to drop into 
his favorite chair. She realized that 
he was emotionally exhausted. 

“Shashi, if he ever finds out how 
I lied to him, I just don’t know 
what he would do.” 

She patted his arm. “It wasn’t 
your fault.” 

“The hell is wasn’t. I should 
have put Baba II through his paces 
immediately but I was too exultant 
over my apparent success. Then 
came Kantikar’s summons and the 
work with his grandson. I let basic 
caution slip.” 

“He doesn’t know that.” 

“No, not now, but I’ll always 
wonder when he might find out. If I 
pull this off, it will get me off the 
hook, but otherwise — ” 

“I? I- thought this was to be a 
team effort.” 

“You know what I meant.” 

“Yes. I know that you meant

exactly what you said. This is your 
holy grail. You are working your 
way to heaven. First transfer Nir- 
ghaz into a new body, then clone a 
standby for yourself. And when you 
feel old age and death whispering at 
your neck, you’ll run and hide in 
your fine, new, young body.” 
“Well, what’s wrong with that?” 
For answer she shook her head 
and said, “Maya.” 

“Sometimes you sound like a 
guru. This world is no illusion. Re- 
birth is the illusion.” 

“You say . but you have no 
proof that it is so.” 

“Nor have you.” 

“True,” she said, unperturbed. 
“One does not look to illusion for 
proof of illusion’s nonexistence.” 
They stared at one another, each 
firmly caught in his own neat, cir- 
cular pattern of argument. Then she 
slid past the issue by settling in 
against his knee and taking his 
hand. 

“Ram.” 

He smiled and let some of the 
tension drain away. “Yes, love.” 
“About my barrenness.” He 
started, for barrenness was a subject 
of deep taboo that no barren woman 
would willingly discuss. “My ova 
are infertile but 1 am anatomically 
normal.” 

She paused then. He did not 
know what she was driving at; he 
already knew that she could carry 
an embryo to term were it artifi- 
cially implanted, but there were tens 
of thousands of women who would 
willingly do that if fertile ova were 
available. 

“Ram Singh, my lover, will you 
give me your child? Your clone 
child.” 



He was stunned. “Wouldn’t you 
rather the child be of your own 
heritage?” 

She shook her head. “Yours, 
love, yours.” 

He looked down at her sober, 
earnest face and was deeply moved. 
He nodded and she came into his 
lap, kissing him and crying. 

* * * 

His fingers touched the bandage 
on his forearm where the tissue had 
been taken and he reflected on the 
reverse symbolism of that wound. 
Across the room Shashi worked 
deftly, lovingly, culturing the cells 
for cloning. It took her three hours. 
Sunlight slanted in from the west 
across the lab (so orderly in contrast 
to his) as she finished, still hum- 
ming the tune with which she had 
begun the afternoon. 

Casually he took her hand when 
she had finished but she pulled his 
face down for a kiss that was far 
from casual. He held her close, 
thinking that he had never seen her 
more beautiful. 

“Tomorrow,” she said, “I’ll 
have Doctor Choudry to do the im- 
plant.” 

“Are you sure this is what you 
want?” 

She nodded and smiled still more 
deeply. “Tonight we celebrate.” 

“How do you celebrate the initi- 
ation of a pregnancy?” he asked, 
deadpan, and she giggled outright. 

* * * 

That night he moved into 
Shashi’s quarters. They were 

crowded but it did not matter.

Neither of them gave much time to 
sleeping. 

Whether it was his near brush 
with Sri Karji’s wrath or Shashi’s 
commitment to him he could not 
have said, but the urgency of his 
quest for immortality returned to 
him renewed. 

The next morning he sent a letter 
to an old friend and professor in 
NorAm, James Brigham, whose ac- 
complishments he had long since 
outstripped but whose wisdom he 
highly respected. That letter con- 
tained an outline of what he had 
done and the promise of detailed 
explanations to be forthcoming. He 
also instructed Brigham to prepare 
to publish his notes in the event of 
his death, feeling that once enough 
people knew of the resurrection 
process, nothing could prevent 
mankind from rising up to demand 
its universal implementation.

N/rg/iaz lay back, immersed in the 
temperature- and gravity-neutraliz- 
ing fluid, his head encased in a 
helmet that barred all sound, sight 
and smell. The salt water sur- 
rounding him was 1 exactly 98.6 de- 
grees; the air that moved into his 
lungs held progressively less oxygen 
and a carefully balanced percent- 
age of carbon dioxide. 

Respiration, metabolism and cog- 
nition slowly abated. There was no 
light, no taste, no touching and, of 
sound, only the gentle susurration 
of incoming air. 

Gradually the murmur of airflow 
changed to a pulsing whisper that 
lulled him still deeper into the 



trance; and the soft voice, Shashi’s 
voice, that had always been there 
just below the level of his notice, 
spoke to him of sleep and of child- 
hood; and his mind, cut free, re- 
membered. 



* *

Light! As the sleep had been be- 
yond sleep, so the awakening was 
violent beyond any awakening he 
had previously experienced. His 
disorientation changed to despair as 
the laughing, running child he had 
been in his dreams became a legless 
horror once more. For a cold mo- 
ment he was drowning in some 
gigantic, malign womb; then strong 
hands had ahold of him and he was 
lifted into the chilly air of reality. 
He pawed at the all-enveloping 
hood but it was cleverly latched and 
he had to wait, helpless, fighting 
claustrophobia, while the lab assist- 
ants removed it. 

He lay still for a while beneath 
the light blanket they had put over 
his naked body, watching with 
small interest as the aides swabbed 
the saline fluid from the floor and 
then departed. Shashi came over 
with a smile to sit beside him and 
he reached out to take her hand, 
needing the touch of humanity to 
return him to the present. 

Ram David was hunched over a 
typeset, engaged in a dialogue with 
the computer. His profile was fro- 
zen in a mask of utter concentration 
and there was no sound in the room 
but human .breathing, the humming 
respiration of machines and the drip 
of salt water from the table where 
Nirghaz lay. 

Nirghaz blinked back tears and

Shashi gently wiped his face. The 
memories dredged up were as fresh 
in his mind as though he had just 
lived them, not like those of a 
dream that vanish with awakening: 
the desert outside Kabul; his 
mother’s delicate beauty; his stern 
father returning home after another 
attempt to settle the dispute his 
Hindu wife and half-caste son had 
raised; the bougainvillaea vine out- 
side his window down which he had 
climbed; the shouting, rock-throw- 
ing band of boys crying, “Hindu, 
Hindu, Hindu!” 

Finally Dave switched off the 
console and came to stand beside 
Shashi. Nirghaz felt an unexpected 
rush of black resentment for the 
legs he walked on and for his man- 
hood. Dave and Shashi made no se- 
cret of their liaison. Jealousy burned 
bright inside Nirghaz and he fought 
it unsuccessfully, for it was not 
Shashi that he wanted, but his own 
lost manhood. 

Dave smiled wearily. ‘‘We got 
it.” 

Nirghaz nodded, too spent to feel 
elation. 

“You were under a trance much 
deeper than is ever used in therapy, 
so anything we may have missed is 
unlikely to be crucial.” 

“You didn’t get it all?” Nirghaz 
felt an irrational fear growing within 
him. To gain a new body but to 
lose a part of himself in the do- 
ing — unthinkable. 

“What did you do on the af- 
ternoon of the fourteenth of May 
the year you were four years old?” 

Nirghaz hesitated, then shrugged. 
“I don’t know.” 

“You went out with your father 
to pick up some chutneys for your 

36 



mother and the taxi broke down on 
the way home. You were impressed 
by the way the driver repaired the 
trouble with a mere piece of wire 
and you learned a new obscenity 
listening to him.” 

Nirghaz still looked blank. “I 
don’t remember.” 

Dave shook his head. “1 didn’t 
expect you to. It is unlikely that 
you will ever remember the incident 
although you will, of course, re- 
member our discussing it now. Yet 
you brought it up under trance. In 
short, once the transference is com- 
plete, you could undergo standard 
hypno-analysis and never reveal any 
gaps in your memory. Anything we 
did not get, you have forgotten 
completely.” 

Nirghaz looked relieved. Dave 
continued, “We are up to age five 
now but future sessions will not 
progress as rapidly. Your recall of 
incidents will increase according to 
some as yet unknown exponent, so 
we will probably require thirty or 
forty sessions to obtain every mem- 
ory on tape. The mind has an 
amazing capacity.” 

While Shashi went out for tea, 
Dave helped Nirghaz dress and then 
lifted him into his wheelchair. 
When Shashi returned, the young 
man had regained most of his com- 
posure and he accepted the mild, 
warm stimulant gratefully. 

“Ramadav, one thing troubles 
me.” 

“What is that?” 

“When you first acquainted me 
with the memory-transference con- 
cept, it was a one-shot method. 
One’s memory was transferred in- 
tact from an old or broken body 
into a new, healthy one. I could ac- 



GALAXY 




cept that; after all, it was not that 
different from our concept of trans- 
migration. But this use of multiple 
taping sessions and a comput- 
er .. well, look at it this way. 
When I was five years old, my 
father took me out horseback-riding 
for the first time. You have that on 
tape?” Dave nodded. “But 1 still 
remember it.” 

After a long pause, Dave prompt- 
ed, “So?” 

“So when you have all of my 
memories on tape, I will still have 
them in my head. When you trans- 
cribe them into my clone, they will 
still be here in my head. Which one 
will be me?" 

“The question won’t arise,” 
Dave assured him. “When we make 
the last tape — and the transfer- 
ence— we will terminate life support 
to your previous body.” 

Nirghaz could only stare in 
shock. “You mean that there will 
really be two of me and that you 
will kill one of them for the sake of 
a neat closure to the experiment?” 

Dave fought back the desire to 
merely shrug. He had thought 
deeply along these lines and all of the 
legal and moral questions were re- 
solved to his own satisfaction. Still, 
he knew the problematical nature of 
the question and was not sure that 
he could win anyone over by the 
same arguments he had used in 
order to still his own doubts. 

“It will be like going to sleep 
and waking up to find your own 
body regenerated,” he answered 
quietly. 

“No. That is no answer. If you 
did not kill me off, it would be like 
going to sleep and waking to find 
someone with my memories and my 



rejuvenated body going on to live a 
separate life while 1 remain tied to 
this body.” 

“That won’t happen.” 

Nirghaz shook his head. “It isn’t 
good enough. Look, 1 am no or- 
thodox Hindu. If I were, I would be 
looking for release from rebirth, not 
a continuance of my life on earth. 
Yet I cannot simply follow your 
way. I do believe in an atman, an 
essence, and that essence cannot in- 
habit two places at once.” 

Dave ground his teeth. Shashi 
was sitting tensely, watching them 
both. He knew that she agreed with 
Nirghaz. “Look, when you go to 
sleep and then awaken, you don’t 
consider yourself a different person 
simply because there is an eight- 
hour gap in your existence. It will 
be the same with the resurrection 
process.” 

“Maybe.” 

Shashi broke in, “Nirghaz, you 
are strictly a volunteer. If you don’t 
want to go through with this, sim- 
ply say so.” 

Dave gave her an angry stare 
which she chose to ignore. 

“What other chance do I have?” 
“There is the possibility of a 
brain transplant but the prognosis on 
that would be very poor. Otherwise 
you can simply go on as you are. 
You seem to have adapted well to 
your difficulties and your condition 
is no worse than that of many other 
cripples.” 

Nirghaz almost snarled. Looking 
at Shashi’s soft womanhood, he did 
not — could not — desire her, but he 
remembered what desire was, and 
desire’s consummation. Burning 
with shame and loss, he said, “For 
the time being let us continue, but I

have to consider this very deeply 
before we conclude the experi- 
ments.”

X-ray and ultraviolet sensors 
probed it continuously where visible 
light could never go and where in- 
frared sensors would have been 
blinded by the uniformity of temper- 
ature. Electrical discharges shocked 
its muscles into motion from time to 
time so that they would grow. 

It had the appearance of a ten- 
year-old child, still floating foetal in 
the saline womb of the sensory-de- 
privation chamber. Resemblance to 
Nirghaz at age ten was superficial 
at best, for this body had never run, 
twisted, played or felt the darkening 
sun on its skin. Thin, flaccid, dead 
white, it floated blind in the eternal 
night and slept mindlessly on. 

* * * 

Within Shashi’s womb, unhurried 
by growth stimulants, a natural 
foetus grew. It floated secure and 
ignorant of the unease that caused 
her to toss sleeplessly on her pallet. 

Shashi shifted her weight again 
and Dave sought her hand. “Can’t 
you sleep either?” she asked. 

“No. I’ve been thinking; after we 
tape and reconstruct Nirghaz, I 
think we may be able to persuade 
Kantikar to continue our funding 
and perhaps let us continue using 
the computer.” 

“Probably. I’m sure he will be 
very grateful.” 

“I intend to tape myself.” 

He listened for censure in her 



voice but the tone of her reply was 
neutral. “I knew.” 

“I want to tape you too.” 

There was a brief delay. “I knew 
that also. I won’t let you.” 

“Why not?” 

“I have no desire for rebirth — 
that way.” 

“Are you so content with a rein- 
carnation that may not be more than 
an illusion— and which will not 
leave you your memories even if it 
were true?” 

“Yes.” 

After a long time of silent breath- 
ing, he said, “Damn!” 

She raised herself on her elbow 
and looked down at him in the dim- 
ness. “Ram, my lover and my love. 
You think only of the future; what 
of the past? Everything 1 am to- 
day — and everything you are, if you 
would just admit it — is the product 
of a hundred thousand previous in- 
carnations. Every decent thing I do, 
every kindness and every attention 
to my fellow man, is the good 
within me that remains after the 
purging effect of a thousand other 
lives. If I could live on forever, just 
twenty-eight, just as happy in your 
love, it would be a kind of death. 
Never to change, never to be a 
child again, never to face truly new 
challenges, never to be reborn fresh 
and clean — what an awful fate. 
Death-in-life. That is what you 
offer.” 

“If you feel that way, why are 
you helping me with Nirghaz?” 
“Nirghaz is a special case. We 
aren’t giving him immortality, just a 
new set of legs and genitalia.” 

“It could lead to immortality.” 
“Yes. But I will have no part in 
that.”

“Then you won’t let me tape 
you?” 

“Never.” 

“And if 1 tape myself?” 

She didn’t answer at once, so he 
prompted, “Shashi. Answer me.” 

“1 think I may leave you.” 
“What?” 

“1 love you, Ramadav, but one 
lifetime is enough.” 

He turned away from her in anger 
and she did not try to call him 
back.

Dr. James Brigham 
Department of Biology 
Roanoke University 
Roanoke, Appalachia, NorAm 

Dear Jim, 

The political situation here con- 
tinues to worsen, as you are no 
doubt aware. 1 fear that it may 
interfere with my work, but even 
more I fear that Nirghaz Husain 
may back out at the last minute. 

I had hoped that by working in 
India, where the people have a con- 
ception of transmigration on which 
to hang the resurrection project, I 
would not have to contend with the 
same innate conservatism that I 
would have faced in NorAm. Damn 
all religions! They provide the con- 
tentment of illusion and prevent 
mankind from turning their vague 
promises of heaven into reality. 

I find that atman is as insidious 
as soul ever was. Not that I really 
blame Husain for his reticence. I 
myself find it harder to accept the 
possibility of multiple, coequal in- 
dividuals than to simply accept 
transference. But the alternative is 



death, and death is no alternative. 

However, if you don’t really be- 
lieve in death . you see my 
problem. 

James, my old friend, I have 
given much thought to the ultimate 
implications of the resurrection pro- 
cess and it occurs to me that I am 
simply incapable, by temperament 
and training, of visualizing the in- 
credible changes it will eventually 
bring about. My aims are so simple, 
so basic — plainly stated, immortal- 
ity for myself. Dare I confess it? 

There has never been any other 
motivation for my work than pure, 
selfish fear of death. Yet now I re- 
alize that 1 may not live to complete 
the work. You must have guessed 
that; you always were sensitive to 
others. Wisdom was never one of 
my attributes but 1 know myself 
well enough to know that in- 
telligence is no substitute for wis- 
dom. That is why I write you these 
letters, that and the fear — growing 
daily — that you will have to publish 
my notes eventually in order to see 
that the work is not lost. Be careful! 
Do not let the notes fall into hands 
other than yours. 

1 am rambling. It is past midnight 
now and I am very tired. Husain 
had another taping session today 
and left in a foul and depressed 
mood. If he turns away from the 
experiments now, we will lose 
years ! At best, Kantikar will cut us 
back to our previous level of sup- 
port, and I fear that he might be- 
come angry and cut us off al- 
together. The man’s power is 
frightening and it grows in direct 
proportion to the imminence of war. 
And, of course, we may all die in a 
nuclear fireball before you even see

this letter. 1 shall try to send you 
updates twice weekly from now on, 
in case that occurs. 

If it seems strange that one who 
has admitted selfishness as his only 
motivation should be so deeply con- 
cerned with the welfare of the world 
at large, and that he should also be 
so highly concerned to see that his 
work outlives him . well, 
frankly, I find it strange myself. No 
amount of self-analysis seems to ac- 
count for it, so 1 merely commend 
it to you for study. You often un- 
derstood me better than 1 under- 
stood myself anyway. 

Enough misery. 

Shashi is well and her pregnancy 
proceeds without complication. 
Birth is due in seven months. I wish 
that you could meet her. And, no, 
we will not marry. That is her deci- 
sion, but you should understand that 
as a Hindu widow, her status would 
only be diminished by remarriage. 

It is unlikely that we will be able 
to leave here until the Husain matter 
is decided one way or another, and 
I cannot advise you to come to 
India while war is threatening. 

Until we meet again, know that 
you have been a true friend. 

Dave Singer 

Dave sealed the letter and laid it 
aside. He stretched and walked 
across the lab to the coffee pot, 
drew a cup and grimaced in dis- 
taste. The brew was thick, black 
and awful, but he watered it down 
and drank it anyway, ft was past 
midnight and his head felt enlarged, 
his eyes stinging and hot. Shashi 
would be long since asleep. Out- 
side, he had heard no sound for 
hours but the passing of the sentry. 



There were always guards present 
ever since they had moved to the 
Deliac complex. 

Nirghaz Husain had had the use 
of a sensory-deprivation tank and a 
battery of overseeing technicians. 
Dave had only himself. Settling the 
cap atop his head, he made sure 
that the electrodes pierced the 
appropriate points on his scalp. He 
felt light-headed as he settled back. 
After drawing a syringe of amber 
fluid, he sought and found a vein. 

Then he began to recite, “ Out 
mani paclme um. ...” 

★ * * 

Terminating its run, the computer 
sent a preemptory jolt of electricity 
through the scalp electrodes, 
shocking Dave instantly awake. He 
tore off the cap, tears streaming 
down his face as the memory of his 
long-dead mother faded. For five 
hours he had been a child 
again . and now there was no 
one to ease his transition back into 
reality. 

He staggered as he crossed the 
room. The computer chuckled, 
gurgled and hummed its mechanical 
contentment. If only the throbbing 
in his head would stop. 

It took another hour to recover 
the first of his life tapes and to in- 
struct the computer to forget the 
night’s work. Then he walked 
slowly out to greet the sunrise. 

* * * 

Colonel Mohan Bhatt, comman- 
dant of Deliac Air Force base, 
waited until a servant had answered 
the door in response to his ring. 



40 



GALAXY 




Then he followed him into an inner 
room. The master of the house did 
not greet the Colonel or even admit 
his presence. If questioned, he 
would say that he had not had the 
pleasure of meeting Colonel Bhatt. 

Gopal Bhargava, leader of the 
Loyal Opposition, met him in the 
inner room. The drapes were 
drawn. Bhargava waived Bhatt to a 
chair and offered him a drink, then 
raised his eyebrows. 

“Well?”' 

This was the moment Bhatt had 
dreaded but there was little he could 
do to make it easier. 

“1 haven’t much to give you. 
Kantikar has thrown such a net of 
security around that project that 
even a rat couldn’t get through. I’ve 
tried to transfer some of my men 
into the place — no luck — and to 
bribe the men he put in. Nothing. 
I’ve thrown everything I dare 
against him and it all just bounced. 
If I try any harder, the whole world 
is going to know it.” 

Bhargava nodded, unperturbed. 
“Don’t worry about it, Mohan. 
Kantikar has more trouble in Bom- 
bay than he can handle. What do 
you think of Ullah’s actions?” 

Ullah was an Indian Air Force 
general who had recently, through a 
deliberate but plausible misin- 
terpretation of his orders, brought 
off a new series of bombings, this 
time deep into Medinan territory. 

“Outstanding, and about time. 
Will the Medinans fight?” 

“I don’t know. I doubt it, not yet 
anyway. Ullah did well. I can’t un- 
derstand why Kantikar left him in 
command; his opinions were never 
very well hidden.” 

“It’s just another proof to me 



that the old man is slipping.” 

“Perhaps. Anyway, I intend to 
press Kantikar very closely now. 
Either he will carry on in a manner 
more suitable to the leader of India, 
or he will censure Ullah. In the case 
of the latter, we’ll have him out on 
a vote of no confidence.” 

“Why not something more di- 
rect?” 

“Assassination? Bhatt, you must 
learn to say what you mean.” 

“All right, assassination.” 
Bhargava swirled the pale liquid 
in his glass and considered. “Not 
now, Mohan. Our last attempt was 
a dismal failure. The only thing that 
saved us was the overeagerness of 
the Premier’s guard. If that bastard 
had lived to talk, we’d both be 
facing a firing squad.” He smiled at 
his nephew. “You don’t really want 
that, do you?” 

* * * 

His name was Ahmed but those 
who knew him called him Ram Lai. 
He had worked on the Ganga Proj- 
ect; he had tried to build a bomb 
into the speaker’s podium where Sri 
Karji was to speak; he had failed. 
Then he had watched with satisfac- 
tion as one of Bhargava’s agents 
had shot at Kantikar and had been 
disgusted that he had done such a 
poor job of it. 

Of course the Indian government 
had blamed the assassination at- 
tempt on Medina, but Ahmed knew 
better. A Medinan agent would not 
have missed; Ahmed knew this for 
he was a Medinan agent. 

Now he waited along the route 
that his contacts had assured him 
Kantikar’s motorcade would take

the following morning, caressing a 
Traktonic Mark X. Ten rounds, 
rocket-powered, heat-seeking, and 
explosive. 

Medinan agents were thorough.

Ramadav had warned him of 
what to expect. The taping would 
be no different than any other ses- 
sion — with the exception that he 
would be running down the 
memories of the last few months, 
reliving (without being aware that 
he dwelled in memory, not in re- 
ality) his decision to transmigrate; 
rearguing with himself, hearing 
again the inner debate and finally 
concluding once more that he would 
go through with the process. 

In fact, he realized, at this very 
moment he might actually be in the 
sensory-deprivation tank, remem- 
bering these things, rather than sit- 
ting in his room thinking these 
thoughts for the first time. It was a 
disconcerting consideration. 

But all that was familiar now. He 
had gained a great respect for the 
powers of memory over these last 
few months; although each session 
overrode the previous one, and he 
could no longer so clearly recall his 
childhood or his adolescence, he 
could remember Jiow he had felt 
after the taping sessions and he re- 
membered the feeling of remem- 
bering. 

Memory of a memory . such 
confusion. He felt depressed and 
old then, and drew his cloak tighter 
about him. 

What would be different (or was 
different if this were memory re- 
playing itself rather than the original 

42 



actuality) about this taping session 
was that he would awaken within 
his new body. Against that, 
Ramadav had been most stringent in 
his warnings, for it would not be a 
pretty sight. His present body was 
merely truncated; the body of the 
clone was a wasted, white wreck. It 
had never seen the sun, never felt 
the pull of gravity. He would be 
bedfast for weeks, even months, as 
he gradually, painfully, nurtured it 
into health. Furthermore, it would 
be a younger body, that of a fif- 
teen-year-old — old enough to con- 
tain his experiences, having the 
proper hormonal balance, but still 
young enough and resilient enough 
to withstand the necessary recovery 
regimen. Even after he had fully re- 
covered, he would be living with 
the experiences of a man housed in 
the body of a boy. 

To run again! To lie with a 
woman again! To be free from the 
attendance of nurses; to be free of 
pity. To once more meet men and 
women as an equal. The need 
burned hot within him, overpower- 
ing any hesitation or doubt, so that 
he yearned for the coming day and 
forgot his fear. 

* * * 

Dave stepped outside just as the 
nurse was helping Husain transfer to 
the wheelchair. The young man 
looked up at him and grinned. 

“This will be the last time I have 
to do this.” 

Dave could see worry and antici- 
pation warring in his expression. He 
took the handles of the chair and 
wheeled him inside. 

“Have you had any trouble with 

GALAXY 




Bhait?” Nirghaz asked. 

“No, not really. He’s tearing his 
hair out because there is a secret on 
his base that he doesn’t know 
about.” 

“Don’t be too sure. I saw him 
this morning when I came aboard 
and he said, ‘How much do you 
think you’ll eventually pay for re- 
covery?’ He seems to know pretty 
much what we are up to.” 

Dave thought about it for a min- 
ute. “I suppose the type of equip- 
ment we’ve imported tells him 
something, and my research papers 
to date are freely available to any- 
one who is curious. Still, there is 
nothing he can do as long as your 
grandfather is Premier.” 

Husain nodded. “Indian politics 
are funny. They often work out 
along family lines. Bhatt is a 
nephew to the opposition leader in 
Congress.” 

“Really. That’s some coinci- 
dence.” 

“Ramadav! Come up for air; get 
your head out of that computer and 
take a look at the real world. There 
is no coincidence involved when a 
half-competent light colonel gets 
boosted in rank and given a major 
post to command within a month of 
his uncle’s becoming opposition 
leader.” 

Dave shrugged again, totally un- 
interested. 

Shashi met them at the door of 
the lab with a smile for Nirghaz. 
There was no smile for Dave. 

Nirghaz turned' aside, asking,' 
“Ramadav, are you sure that I can’t 
have a look at the body I am about 
to inhabit? It might make my tran- 
sition easier.” 

Dave shook his head. “Sorry.” 



“Where is Sri Karji?” Shashi 
asked. 

Dave had said nothing on the 
matter but he also was surprised 
that Kantikar was not on hand for 
the culmination of Nirghaz’s 
restoration. 

“He wanted to be present but he 
has to give a speech in Udaipur at 
the headquarters of the Panch-ab 
project. It’s an essential appear- 
ance,” Nirghaz explained. 

The lab assistants helped Nirghaz 
out of his clothing. The shame he 
felt was more than mere reaction to 
nakedness, but it was a small thing 
to endure in recompense for what 
would be his. 

Dave carried over the helmet. It 
was made from a life cast, its pli- 
able interior molded to every line 
and plane of his head. He shivered 
each time it was slipped over his 
fa^e, cutting off all contact with the 
world beyond. Shashi always gave 
him a moment to regain his compo- 
sure before donning it, but today 
Dave was handling it, and he was 
all business. 

Darkness; a fumbling and tugging 
as the helmet was tightened. Tiny 
nipples spread his nostrils and the 
air had a faint metallic tang. It 
changed to a subtle perfume as the 
hoses were hooked up to the airflow 
monitor. Then there was a slap on 
his shoulder (Ramadav, no doubt) 
and hard hands caught him under 
the armpits. 

Warm fluid; a feeling of drown- 
ing. The saline was of the same 
exact temperature as his skin and it 
buoyed him up. Within moments 
the sensation of wetness had passed 
and he was floating free, insulated 
from heat, light and the pull of 



TO GO NOT GENTLY 



43 




gravity. He heard a crash; then 
there was only/ the roar of fast- 
moving water and the susurration of 
air. 

The outer tank had been filled 
and sealed, barring all sound save 
any he himself chose to make. The 
umbilical cord was long enough to 
suspend him in the center of the 
tank, five meters’ distance from 
each wall. He moved his hands but 
felt no sensation in them. Only 
proprioception and cognition re- 
mained — and hearing, for the 
pounding of his heart had become 
loud in his ears. And scent, for 
some chemical had been introduced 
into his air stream and conscious- 
ness began to fail. 

Then there was the same sure 
voice — Shashi’s voice — that always 
banished his claustrophobia and 
guided him back to the appropriate 
moment so that he began to re- 
member .... 

Dave sat before the computer, his 
hands flashing agilely over the com- 
plex controls. Shashi stood before 
the monitors of the clone, continu- 
ally testing and gradually bringing it 
up to the threshold of consciousness 
so that it could receive the 
memories that were to humanize it. 



★ * * 

The motorcade wound into view 
and Ahmed flipped off the safety, 
bringing the nylon stock up to his 
cheek. The crosshairs fell on the 
lead vehicle and held as it slipped 
past, as a second slipped past, and 
as the bubble-topped tram bearing 
Kantikar rolled into view. He 
pressed the firing stud. The projec- 

44 



tile said fisssss, fading, and the 
dome of the tram was lost in a burst 
of flame. 

Ahmed fired again and again, 
knowing that one projectile alone 
would not burst that dome. The 
ground around him exploded from 
the guards’ return fire. He lost his 
sight picture, rolled aside and 
waited for three interminable 
heartbeats. The smoke began to 
clear (he had carefully chosen a hill 
overlooking the ocean for the sake 
of its breeze) and he fired again. In 
the brief moment allotted, he had 
seen that the dome was cracked. 

Then the world was tom apart 
about him . and he knew no 
more. 

* * * 

The computer was able to transfer 
taped memories to the clone at the 
same time it recorded fresh 
memories from Nirghaz, but Dave 
waited for an hour until there was 
no risk that the taping would abort. 
Then he activated the computer into 
transfer and the first tape, taken 
months earlier, began to print itself 
onto the soft flesh of the clone’s 
empty mind. It began to experience 
Nirghaz’s childhood. 

It would take as many hours to 
transcribe the tapes as it had re- 
quired to make them, and although 
the process was a thousand times 
shorter than the original accumula- 
tion of those memories, it would 
still take better than one hundred 
and fifty hours. 

Five hours passed before Dave 
began to relax. The final taping was 
through. Nirghaz lay quiescent in 
the sensory-deprivation tank; he 

GALAXY 




would remain thus until all the 
memories were transcribed to his 
clone. Then Dave would cut his 
oxygen. 

This Shashi knew; yet as the 
moment approached, she began to 
fear. That final moment would not 
arrive until the transcription was 
completed some six days hence. 
Still .... 

She had pondered long and deep 
over the implications of the coming 
transference and its meaning for 
Nirghaz’s atman. Would the es- 
sence of what was Nirghaz pass 
from one body to the next when the 
first was extinguished? She thought 
that it would, but who could be 
certain? 

There was a sudden disturbance 
in the tank that Shashi tended. The 
clone had begun to writhe as it ex- 
perienced life vicariously, but it was 



well restrained. Carefully Shashi 
checked all the dials, then realized 
that she was holding her breath. 

Dave left his console, stretching 
hugely, and walked around the 
room, checking monitors. Nirghaz’s 
broken body lay secure in its 
deathwomb. His memories were 
quiescent in a sleep beyond sleep 
while transcriptions of those same 
memories were being fed to his 
clone. There was an electric tension 
in the air. Shashi sought Dave’s at- 
tention with her eyes, but he was 
totally absorbed. 

The clone jerked, trying to cry 
out through a mouth that had never 
known speech, and was restrained 
by the helmet. Dave leaned over 
Shashi’s shoulder, further checking 
monitors, his face as expressionless 
as the smooth wall of the tank. 

Shashi walked away, leaving him 

45 



TO GO NOT GENTLY 




alone to watch the progress. She 
should sleep now. Nirghaz had 
agreed to the project. He was her 
friend and he had walked (she shiv- 
ered at that unintended thought) 
wide-eyed into this; it was her duty 
to him to carry her end of the pro- 
cess. She should sleep, for either 
she or Dave must remain on duty 
constantly through the coming days, 
and neither of them would dare 
leave the room unattended until the 
transference was completed. 

There was a tray of sandwiches 
on the table. She was not hungry 
but she ate, thinking of Nirghaz and 
of her unborn child. 

The assistants had left after 
helping place Nirghaz in the tank. 
No eyes but Dave’s and her own 
had ever seen this room in action. 
She let her eyes sweep the interior 
of the huge abandoned hangar; pain 
and loneliness reflected back. 

Dave now paced like a panther 
before the monitors, completely un- 
aware of her. His feet scuffed the 
floor; the computer hummed; the 
clone writhed. 

Otherwise there was silence. 

IX 

Shashi was jolted awake by a 
pounding on the hangar door. Dave 
looked up in irritation and she hur- 
ried toward the sound. 

“Open up!” It was Bhatt’s voice. 

Shashi turned to Dave hesitantly. 
He shrugged. 

“We can’t open up now, Col- 
onel,” she said in a raised voice. 
“We are at a crucial point in our 
experiments. Anyway, you are not 
authorized to come in here.” 

“I am now. Open up or I’ll have 



the door knocked down.” 

Dave cursed and crossed the 
room. He drew the bolt and faced 
Bhatt as the man shoved in, flanked 
by armed guards. They scattered 
around the hangar, searching for 
other occupants and finding none. 

“What the hell do you think 
you’re doing? This is a top-secret 
project, authorized by the Premier 
himself.” 

Bhatt ignored him. “Where is 
Husain?” 

“I ask again, by what authority 
do you break into a top-secret proj- 
ect?” 

Bhatt rounded on him with a look 
of hatred. “And / ask again, where 
is Husain? Don’t think you can hide 
behind Kantikar any more. He was 
assassinated at dawn this morning 
by a Medinan agent. Bhargava is in 
power for the duration of the 
emergency, or until new elections 
are held. You are no longer in a 
protected position so for your own 
sake, you had better cooperate.” 

Dave and Shashi exchanged looks 
of desperation. Why now, of all 
times? 

“Husain is in one of the sen- 
sory-deprivation tanks,” Dave im- 
provised, “undergoing deep hypnot- 
ic analysis. This project is designed 
to bring up everything, however 
miniscule, he has learned in Medina 
for computer analysis.” 

Bhatt looked like a man who has 
walked full face into a wall. Clearly 
he had had some idea of what was 
going on but Dave’s instant story 
was too plausible to ignore. If it 
were true, he had better tread 
lightly. His sources had given him a 
different tale but they could have 
been misinformed. 



46 



GALAXY 




Dave saw his advantage and took 
it. “I don’t know whose orders you 
are following, but if you don’t keep 
your troops in control and let Doc- 
tor Mathur and me get back to our 
work, Husain will die, and then you 
will be in more trouble than you 
can handle.” 

Dave turned his back on Bhatt 
and walked to the computer con- 
sole. He halted the transcription to 
the clone. His face was as bleak as 
Shashi had ever seen it. 

“What now?” she whispered. 

“Nothing. We cancel everything; 
we tell nothing; but most of all, we 
have to get Nirghaz out of that 
tank!” 

He twisted the dial, increasing 
the oxygen flow to Nirghaz’s bro- 
ken body, and cut in the program of 
music and recorded voices that 
would lure him back from the sleep 
that lies on the edge of death. 

* * * 

Music came softly into his ears, 
followed by voices that seemed to 
make sense but did not, quite. By 
the time he recognized that he was 
hearing an ordinary conversation, 
the key words omitted, he was well 
on his way back to consciousness. 

There was sound, a crashing 
sound followed by the rush of 
water. None of this^ made a great 
deal of sense. What Husain could 
not know was that Dave had intro- 
duced a sedative into his 
bloodstream before awakening him. 

There was a shifting perception 
of motion and harsh hands dragging 
him upward. There was a hard pres- 
sure under his spine and then light, 
blinding light. Dave’s face swam 



oddly above him. Then there was a 
pinprick in his arm. Somehow Nir- 
ghaz knew that all of this was not 
as it had been planned, but then 
darkness took him. 

He was still dissociated and con- 
fused when he awoke. Slowly he 
unwound his memories up to the 
taping and smiled. He had done it! 
That his subsequent memories were 
not as he had been coached was of 
no consequence. 

To live again as a man, a whole 
man! 

He opened his eyes. The ceiling 
was white and he could see little 
else. He could not feel his new 
legs, a fact that displeased him. 
Ramadav had said that he would be 
too weak to sit up but he felt like 
trying. He heaved . and nothing 
happened. 

It was as though he were still 
legless. 

He jerked his head up. It was 
only a momentary glance but he 
could see the hollow in the sheet 
where his legs should have been. 

‘Wo!” His soul-deep cry of be- 
trayal echoed through the building. 

Dave rushed into the room, a 
soldier at his back. Nirghaz’s eyes 
pleaded with him to say that it was 
not true but Dave could only shake 
his head. He took Nirghaz’s hand 
— but Nirghaz turned his face away 
in despair. 

Bhatt came running in and eyed 
Dave suspiciously, commanding, 
“Do what is necessary, but say 
nothing!” 

Dave ignored him. “Nirghaz, I’m 
sorry. Bhatt terminated our experi- 
ment. Your grandfather was assas- 
sinated this morning. The govern- 
ment has resigned.” 



TO GO NOT GENTLY 



47 




“If you say one more word. 
I’ll have you thrown out,” Bhatt 
hissed. 

Dave responded with an obscen- 
ity, in English, but it was one that 
had found its way into many lan- 
guages and Bhatt recognized it. He 
gestured and the soldier prodded 
Dave with his weapon. Dave shrug- 
ged and turned away but not before 
Nirghaz saw the tears that edged his 
eyes. 

Not betrayed, then, for Ramadav 
shares my pain. But to fall from 
such hopes! It is more than / can 
bear. 

Nirghaz looked up at the man 
who had brought him back to this 
hated body and cursed him with a 
fluency and fervor that made all 
previous criticisms seem like com- 
mendations. And Bhatt stood silent 
through it. There was no certainty 
that Husain might not be in power 
again soon — his importance to the 
Medinan negotiations was well 
known. 



* * * 

Gulls wheeled overhead, exulting in 
their freedom and the brisk sea 
wind. Nirghaz watched them cut 
patterns against the blue sky. Great 
clouds were gathering westward out 
at sea, and soon it would be the 
season of the monsoon. 

He slipped the lock on his wheel- 
chair and wheeled it forward to the 
edge of the cliff. He had sent his 
nurse away; he would never have 
been permitted to take such a 
chance otherwise. Far below, the 
beach was deserted. That was good, 
for his purpose. 



There were two packages wedged 
beneath his seat. He took out the 
top one, a recorder, and turned it 
on. 

Bhatt was still holding Ramadav 
and Shashi, although he had not 
dared to detain Husain. Nirghaz had 
already made arrangements for their 
release. 

A gull landed near him and he 
spoke harshly to frighten it away. 

“I am making this record,” he 
said into the microphone, “for the 
sake of my friends and for my own 
sake, should circumstances make it 
possible for Ramadav and Shashi to 
complete the work we set out to do 
together. 

“That which I am about to do is 
in part an affirmation of faith in 
you, my friends. In the months that 
we have been together, I have come 
to have a great affection for you 
both. 

“You have been loyal in trying 
times and I wish you the best in the 
coming confusion. I have made ar- 
rangements with some of those in 
power to make certain of your 
safety since I will be in no position 
to do so myself.” 

He turned off the machine and 
stared out to sea again. The salt 
smell was sharp in his nose and the 
sun felt good. All life was good. 
For a moment he hesitated, but his 
hopes had been raised too high for 
him to return to the old accommo- 
dations. 

He dictated a brief summary of 
events following the moment ,he 
woke up from the aborted trans- 
migration; then he paused once 
more. 

“I know that if it is humanly 
possible to do so, Ramadav and 



48 



GALAXY 




Shashi will continue the project and 
rescue me from my own folly. But 
even if they cannot, my decision 
remains unchanged. There are some 
horrors too great to face, and some 
disappointments too deep to en- 
dure.” 

This time he paused for a very 
long time, staring at the gulls that 
circled overhead. Then he said 
softly, “Shashi, 1 love you. And 
you, Ramadav. Be happier in one 
another’s company than you have 
been of late.” 

He stared down at the beach, a 
cold emptiness growing inside him, 
before making a final entry: “Life, 
I love you. Too much to see you 
broken.” 

He motioned for his nurse and 
then sent him to carry the recorder 
back to the tram at the base of the 
hill. When he was well along the 
way, Nirghaz took out the second 
package and unwrapped it. He had 
made it up himself and knew its 
capabilities. There was a simple 
switch built into one end of the 
casing. 

He looked up again at the gulls 
soaring free . and flipped the 
switch. 

The explosion tore him apart and 
hurled his broken body to the beach 
below. 

X 

Dave paced the floor, occasion- 
ally slamming his fist against the 
wall. It had been their bedroom; 
now it was their prison. 

Shashi sat with her face turned 
toward the wall, her hands folded 
protectively across her belly. Three 
days had passed without word of 



the world beyond their cubicle. 
Three times daily they were fed; 
otherwise they were ignored. 

It was afternoon when they fi- 
nally came for Dave, offering no 
explanation. Two soldiers entered, 
ordered him out and slammed the 
door in Shashi’s face, leaving her 
alone with her fear. 

Bhatt waited for him in his 
office. The impassivity with which 
the man had masked himself was no 
longer present. Without preamble or 
pretense, he said, “Kantikar is 
dead. Now that you have no one to 
speak for you, don’t you think it’s 
about time that you explained the 
experiments you have been doing?” 
“I have already told you more 
than you are authorized to know.” 
“You lied,” Bhatt said, not 
angry but no longer patient. “There 
is little enough to be learned from 
your lab notes but enough to tell 
that your project was for the trans- 
ference of the memories of Husain 
into a new body.” 

Bhatt had seemed so much the 
bumbling fool. Now Dave mentally 
castigated himself for his blindness. 
Fat, yes, and slow of speech and 
action, but the mind that hid behind 
those mild brown eyes was sharp 
and ruthless. 

“What your notes don’t tell,” 
Bhatt went on, “are the codes, 
which are the key to the programs 
in the computer. Short of washing 
out whole banks of memory, we 
cannot make it serviceable again for 
its original purposes. You will give 
me the codes.” 

“No.” 

The skin beside Bhatt’s eyes 
tightened. “Sri Singh, your project 
is ended. The government has need 



TO GO NOT GENTLY 



49 




of the computer you have been mis- 
appropriating. The codes, if you 
please.” 

‘‘Bhatt, ypu had me fooled for a 
while but I no longer consider you 
an idiot.” Bhatt did not turn a hair. 
At one time he would have flown 
into a tantrum at that remark. There 
was no longer any doubt that the 
masquerade was through. “You 
have no intention of erasing the 
programs in that computer. You 
want to protect them for the sake of 
yourself and your superiors.” 

“All right, so we do. What ob- 
jections do you have to that? It is 
your project. Don’t you want to see 
it carried to completion?” 

Suddenly wary, Davie said noth- 
ing. 

“What of Husain? Don’t you 
want to give him back his legs and 
his genitalia?” 

“Of course. But I don’t trust 
you, not one little bit. I will insist 
on safeguards — starting with Shashi’s 
and my immediate release from 
confinement — if we are to deal with 
one another.” 

Bhatt did not argue. Instead he 
drew a newstat from his desk 
drawer and tossed it to Dave. Puz- 
zled, Dave opened it and read the 
headlines that gave the story of 
Kantikar’s death. 

“Bottom left,” Bhatt said, and 
then Dave saw the headline that 
read husain commits suicide. He 
read the article through and dropped 
the stat on Bhatt’ s desk. 

“How do I know that isn’t a 
forgery?” 

Bhatt removed a recorder from 
the same drawer and switched it on. 
Nirghaz’s voice emerged, the 
mewling of gulls in the background. 

50 



When the tape had played through, 
Dave found that moisture had 
sprung to his eyes, and he fought 
the display of emotion. 

“You heard him. He said that he 
had made arrangements ’for our 
safety.” 

Bhatt nodded. “Srinivas has been 
on my tail for two days, trying to 
get me to release the two of you. 
However, there have been these 
rumors circulating, rumors that you 
got the layout of Kantikar’s motor- 
cade route from Husain under the 
guise of taping him and passed it on 
to the assassin who finally got Kan- 
tikar.” 

Despite himself, Dave showed 
dismay and Bhatt chuckled. “Of 
course it may prove that these 
rumors have no foundation. It all 
depends on how well you cooper- 
ate.” 

Dave sighed. “What do you 
want?” 

“That’s better. Do you want to 
reconstruct Husain?” 

“Of course.” 

“Can you do it?” 

Dave hesitated, but there was no 
way out. “Yes.” 

“Good. You will go ahead as 
planned and we will monitor your 
actions, but first you will give us 
the information which your notes 
lacked.” 

★ ★ * 

When Dave returned, safe, 
Shashi’s first reaction was relief, 
but that passed as quickly as it had 
come when she saw the expression 
on his face. “What is it?” 

“It’s Nirghaz. He committed 
suicide.” 



GALAXY 




“No!” 

Dave collapsed into a chair and 
Shashi knelt beside him. “Karji 
died and after that he couldn’t face 
the prospect of going on as a crip- 
ple. He left a recording, stating his 
reasons and saying that he was 
counting on us to reconstruct him.” 
Shashi’s body quivered as though 
struck. -“There’s no way we can do 
that now.” 

“Yes, there is. I made an agree- 
ment with Bhatt to show him how 
the process works in exchange for 
the opportunity to resurrect Nir- 
ghaz.” 

“You didn’t!” 

“Why not? I had no reason to 
keep the process secret.” 

“But Nirghaz is dead.” 

“We have his tapes, Shashi, and 
his clone. Nothing has changed.” 
“Oh, but it has. His atman is 
gone now.” 

“Oh, hell!” 

“If you resurrect him now, you’ll 
only have a zombie. A walking 
corpse.” 

Dave leaped to his feet and began 
to pace the room, muttering curses 
under his breath. Shashi stiffened 
and drew back. He rounded on her, 
anger flushing his face. 

“Dammit, Shashi, it isn’t for you 
to say. If you prefer, -it isn’t for me 
to say either; but Nirghaz has the 
last word. He gave the order for his 
resurrection and I intend to perform 
it, with or without your help.” 
“Well, you won’t have it.” 

Their eyes locked for a space of 
seconds before she turned away 
from him. 

“Shashi!” The word was laid 
against her back like a lash. “Your 
commitment to principle may in- 



deed be admirable but what about 
your commitment to your friends? 
Nirghaz went to his death depend- 
ing on us. Do you know what he 
said in that recording? I can just 
about quote it since I thought they 
might be the last words I would 
ever hear him say. He said, ‘What I 
am about to do is an affirmation of 
faith in my friends. I know that if it 
is humanly possible, Ramadav and 
Shashi will rescue me from my own 
folly.’ ” 

Shashi winced at the words. 

“What kind of principles are 
there that allow you to betray a trust 
like that?” Dave asked. 

Shashi’s shoulders sagged and 
she turned back to Dave with eyes 
that showed no more traces of love. 
“Tomorrow,” she said, “I will 
help you make your zombie, and 
then I’m going to walk away from 
this whole sordid mess and try to 
forget that I ever met you.” 



After the recorder was snapped 
off, Bhatt inquired, “Did you get 
all that?” 

“Yes,” Bhargava’s reply came 
over the phone. “I think we can be 
sure that the woman won’t spread 
what she knows. She hates the 
whole idea of the resurrection proj- 
ect. If it is successful — and, frankly, 
I have my doubts — this Singh will 
be a security risk. Can I count on 
you to take steps?” 

“It will be my pleasure, believe 
me. But why take chances with her 
and Husain?” 

“A good point. Husain will be 
needed as an example of what the 
process can do — if it works.” 



TO GO NOT GENTLY 



51 




Bhargava chuckled. “Actually the 
whole thing will probably prove 
impossible. We can keep an eye on 
the Mathur woman. If she poses a 
risk later, we will take steps then. 
But I want Singh out of the way as 
soon as he finishes with Husain.” 

XI 

Dave put the computer through 
its checks while Shashi examined 
the clone. Armed guards stood at 
the door and an Air Force scientist 
sat at his elbow. 

Shashi came back to see him, her 
eyes unnaturally wide. Even her 
feelings toward Dave were set aside 
for the moment and he felt a touch 
of fear. 

“Is there something wrong with 
the clone?” 

She shook her head and he could 
see that her hands were trembling. 
“It has partial memory — we were 
up to age three when Bhatt inter- 
rupted us.” She swallowed and 
went on, “It’s alive in there, crying 
in the night and trying to get out.” 

Dave shivered at the thought. 

* * * 

Memories flowing in the dark — 
childhood fleeing before adoles- 
cence. The clone aged rapidly, each 
moment adding days to its store of 
experience. A clumsy young man 
alone in the dark with an equally 
clumsy but eager girl. A state ban- 
quet; Sri Karji acknowledging him 
to the world. His mother’s harried 
face when the world refused to 
forget that she had married a hated 
Muslim and had borne a ' half-caste 
child. The girls who would and the 

52 



ones who wouldn’t. Especially Ren- 
ana. 

Working secretly for Karji; the 
interminable negotiations with men 
who valued war over peace. The 
feel of a horse between his legs as 
he flashed across a polo field. The 
flooding warmth of sunshine and the 
relaxing coolness of the ocean. 

Then Mahmet, the polo field, the 
secret negotiations and the planes 
tearing the sky. Pain! Amputation! 
Despair. 

Hours passed as the memories 
accumulated. Dave sent for a sleep- 
ing pad and he and Shashi slept in 
rotation, one of them always 
monitoring the clone. A hospital 
bed was secured in anticipation of 
the project’s completion. 

He remembered Dave’s briskness 
as he settled the helmet in place. 
He felt again the sensation of 
drowning and the gentle onset of 
sleep as the taping began. 

Hr * * 

Pain! Like he had never known 
before. A body so new that it had 
not yet learned to suppress excess 
stimuli, and one that had never 
known the killing pull of gravity. 
He almost passed out with the sheer 
intensity of it. 

The bed beneath Nirghaz was a 
torture rack. He could feel his new 
limbs, but it was not good. Every 
muscle and joint cried out against 
the unaccustomed strain of merely 
living. Finally he felt the relief of 
the warm, deathlike narcotic 
spreading outward from the burning 
in his left forearm. 

Six times Nirghaz awakened to 
such pain that he could not tolerate 



GALAXY 




it and six times either Dave or 
Shashi sent him back into the haven 
of sleep. On each occasion he was 
stronger . but even when lying 
still, his body felt stressed by grav- 
ity, and it responded healthily by 
building new defenses and blocking 
the pain. 

The seventh time he awakened, 
Shashi was at his bedside and she 
sat thus for an hour, holding his 
hand, while he lay awake but too 
spent to talk. 

Finally a natural sleep claimed 
him. 

* * * 

“Your passes, please.” 

Srinivas handed the MP his iden- 
tification and Bannerjee leaned 
across him to do the same. The 
corporal glanced briefly at the pa- 
pers, returned them and passed the 
pair into the base. 

As soon as the monopod was 
gone from sight, he ran to a phone 
and carried out his standing orders. 
Bhatt took the call and left hur- 
riedly, telling his orderly to stall. 

So Srinivas had cornered a 
member of Congress after all. That 
would certainly speed things up. 

* * * 

Shashi was sleeping and Dave 
was sitting at Nirghaz’s bedside 
when Bhatt entered the hangar with 
a contingent of armed MPs. Bhatt 
motioned and two soldiers quickly 
flanked Dave. 

“Take him outside.” 

Dave pulled back. “Bhatt, quit 
making an ass of yourself.” 

“You can’t do this,” Shashi 



shouted. “He hasn’t done any- 
thing.” 

“Restrain the woman. I want a 
guard set over her, and over this 
one too.” He motioned toward Nir- 
ghaz. 

“Bhatt, you just lost yourself a 
career,” Nirghaz promised. 

Bhatt did not seem concerned. He 
turned and followed his men out. 

Outside, Dave blinked at the 
brightness of the day. The soldiers 
who hustled him along were far 
from gentle and he struggled angrily 
against them. 

Bhatt smiled. “Let him go.” 
They did so. 

“You two come here.” The sol- 
diers backed away from Dave, 
clearly puzzled. 

Bhatt had stopped smiling. 
“Men, the prisoner is obviously 
trying to escape. Stop him.” 

Dave stood impassive for one 
heartbeat, shocked into immobility. 
The soldiers who had held him 
swung their rifles up. One of them 
was grinning. 

“Bhatt, no! No\” 

Flash, sound and impact, simul- 
taneous. He felt the slugs rip into 
his body. 

Shashi screamed and fell forward, 
clutching her swollen belly. Some- 
thing had happened there. Some 
thing had come into her. 

The sky was very blue. There 
were no clouds. But there was pain, 
pain. Pain, Pain\ 

SAMSARA 

Shashi and nirghaz produced 
the passports that identified them as 



TO GO NOT GENTLY 



53 




Mr. and Mrs. Jain, traveling with 
their son Lai. Then they picked up 
their baggage and sought a taxi. 
The streets of Casablanca were 
crowded with the noon-time rush. 
Nirghaz looked back constantly, but 
if they were being followed, he did 
not detect it. 

They changed taxis twice, rode a 
bus, took another taxi and finally 
walked through the open-air bazaar 
in centertown to a certain cafe. 

There they recognized James 
Brigham from the picture they had 
been provided. He rose to greet 
them, then seated Shashi and ordered 
refreshments. They talked of trivia 
for an hour, rose and departed in 
Brigham’s monopod. Only when 
they were safely inside did they 
relax the masquerade and say what 
was on their minds. 

“Sorry for the cloak-and-dagger 
stuff,” Brigham said, “but we can’t 
be too careful.” 

“Never mind,” Shashi reassured 
him. “Paranoia is in thinking they 
are out to get you when they aren’t. 
We both know they are, and we can 
only guess at how many varieties 
they come in.” 

“Two years of dodging the In- 
dian Secret Police is enough to 
make anyone cautious,” Nirghaz 
added. 

“What do you know of the Proj- 
ect?” Brigham asked. 

Nirghaz and Shashi exchanged 
glances. “We can guess,” Nirghaz 
said, “but we actually know little.” 

“Nor do we want to know any- 
thing,” Shashi added. “We only 
want you to know where we are and 
to know how to reach you in case 
of an emergency.” 

“Have it your own way, although 



1 will say that you can’t expect 
much from us if that is going to be 
your attitude. You will keep 
lifetapes on file?” 

“No,” Shashi replied firmly. 

“But you’ll have to, or 

you’ll ...” Brigham broke off 
lamely, remembering the comments 
in Dave’s letters about Shashi. 

“No tapes,” Shashi repeated, 

and if Nirghaz looked uncomforta- 
ble, Brigham did not know him 
well enough to notice. 

“Then there is really no reason to 
go further, is there?” 

“Only one,” Shashi said and 

then hesitated before asking, “What 
about David Singer?” 

“We have his tapes and very 

soon we will be able to resurrect 
him. A damned shame that we 
don’t have a tissue sample, but any 
body is better than none.” 

Brigham smiled but the joke fell 
flat. Shashi bounced her son on her 
knee, a distant look on her face. 

“Sri Brigham, I have one last 
debt to discharge. Can you get me a 
scalpel and a sterile tissue-sample 
container?” 

“Yes, of course. Why?” 

“My son is David Singer’s 
clonechild. His genetic twin. What 
is it your Bible says — an eye for an 
eye, a clone for a clone?” 

Brigham smiled a smile he did 
not feel, recognizing Shashi’s dis- 
tress in the pitiful attempt at levity. 

* * * 

. then Dave adjusted the com- 
puter for an automatic recording 
run and settled the headpiece into 
place. He took up the syringe and 
pierced a vein, letting the relaxing 



54 



GALAXY 




chemical flow into his system, and 
lay back .... 

He was drowning in warm, wet 
darkness. Then there was noise and 
a rushing of waters, and light, and 
pain. 

The bed beneath his back was a 
torture rack and his disorientation 
was complete. He was not in the 
hangar lab . where was he? He 
tried to sit up and found he could 
not. Desperately he tried to under- 
stand it all. 

And then he knew — or thought he 
did — and he raised his arm. Thin; 
flaccid- white. He let the arm fall. 

All the nightmarish questions re- 
turned to him then. Am I really me? 
Of course he was himself. How 
could it be otherwise? 

★ ★ * 

Weeks passed. 

Dave remembered nothing of 
Kantikar’s assassination, Nirghaz’s 
suicide or his own death. All of 
those events had taken place after 
his last taping session and were ir- 
retrievably lost to him. Jim Brigham 
stayed with him constantly through- 
out the trying first weeks, along 
with Anson and Angellena Piaget. 
They were strangers to him, re- 
cruited by Brigham to man the se- 
cret resurrection project in the Atlas 
Mountains, but they were human 
and they lent him their humanity in 
the crucial first days of his recov- 
ery. 

He had lost two years but he had 
gained an immeasurably long 
lifetime. Jim assured him that every 
conceivable step had been taken to 
ensure the security of-the Project. 

He learned that Shashi and Nir- 



ghaz were nearby but unconnected 
with the Project; that they were lov- 
ers of two years’ standing; that they 
were raising his son, whom Shashi 
had named Ram Singh . and that 
they would not see him. 

None of it made any sense to 
him. 

* * * 

He was sitting in his room, spent 
from exercise but too restless to 
sleep, when she came. Anson had 
given warning that she was there 
and he had prepared himself as best 
he could. 

He had known jealousy in the 
first few weeks but that had passed: 
His affection for Nirghaz was too 
great. And besides, he had lost 
Shashi some time before his death. 
He remembered that directly, and 
what he had learned about the 
period that spanned his last taping 
session and his death only con- 
firmed his suspicions that their re- 
lationship had worsened toward the 
end. 

Nirghaz had not taken Shashi 
from him; he, himself, had lost her. 

She was as lovely as he remem- 
bered her, but something had taken 
away her smile. There were lines at 
the comers of her eyes that had not 
been there before. 

“Hello, Shashi.” 

“Hello.” 

“I’ve missed you. You should 
have come sooner.” 

She moistened her lips, looking 
trapped. He wondered if she were 
embarrassed by her liaison with 
Nirghaz and hoped that that was all 
that stood between them. It was 
not.

“I only came to discharge one 
last debt.” 

' Her tone surprised him. ‘‘Shashi, 
nothing that I remember and noth- 
ing that anyone has told me has 
ever led me to believe that you had 
come to hate me.” 

“1 don’t hate you.” 

‘‘You seem to.” 

‘‘I just don’t know who you 
are.” 

‘‘1 am David Singer. Or Ram 
David Singh, if you prefer that 
name.” 

“No, you are not.” 

“Hell, Shashi, are you going to 
start that again?” 

She silenced him by turning 
away. He bit back any further angry 
comments and said, “Sorry.” 

“Did anyone tell you what hap- 
pened to me when Ram David 
died?” 

“No. What happened when / 
died?” 

“When Ram David died, his 
atman entered the child in my 
womb.” 

“Nonsense.” 

She turned on him angrily. 
“Nonsense? How would you know? 
I was there; I felt it. I knowV' 

“And I am here. I am myself, 
fully; / know it.” 

She almost smiled then, but her 
tears ruined it. Softly she said, 
“Well, at least you sound like 
him ... but you are not him. That 
which was Ram David Singh trans- 
migrated to my child. That’s why I 
named him Ram Singh, not out of 
sentiment. That which was the es- 
sence of the man I loved now re- 
sides in Ram Singh, ready and will- 
ing to experience life again, fresh 
and untainted. No mere rerun of old 



experiences, old mistakes. That’s 
why 1 am staying away from the 
Project — that and my repugnance at 
the whole thing. I intend to see that 
Ram Singh will have a chance at a 
new life.” 

“And me? Who, then am I?” 

“1 don’t know.” 

“I do. 1 am David Singer — and 
you are out of your mind.” 

“So you think.” 

“So I know!” 

She was silent then, without 
having conceded anything. 

“If what you say is true, why 
have you come to me? What am I 
to you?” he asked suddenly. 

She looked at him long and 
sadly. “You are a phantom out of 
my past. You are a walking dead 
man. You are an abomination. And 
yet ... I hunger at the sight of 
your face.” 

“I still love you.” 

“Stop that!” 

“I do.” 

Tears were flowing freely down 
her face but she remained adamant. 

“Shashi, what did you come here 
for?” 

“To ask you, in memory of the 
man who once wore that sweet 
body, in the name of the man you 
think yourself to be, to leave me 
and mine utterly alone. To never 
seek me out. To never contact my 
son. Not to haunt me like the ghost 
that you are.” 

He examined the lap robe for a 
time and then raised his eyes to 
meet hers. “If 1 do this thing you 
ask, Shashi, it is only because I still 
love you.” 

She was sobbing softly when she 
left the room without once looking 
back. ★

Colonel braun stood before 
Spacefleet General Eastland’s desk, 
i drying to get the general’s attention. 
i Eastland, eyes glazed, stared off in 
an apparently random direction. 

The senile old fool , Braun 
rf , i| thought. With this kind of leader- 
ship , it’s no wonder we can’t defeat 
:} f : J Sir Alec's Spaceforce. “Sir?” he 
W**' asked, for the third time. 

Eastland’s eyes wandered over to 
Braun. “Ah yes, colonel. What is 

I it?” 

“Sir, I’ve come up with a plan 
which should delay the Empire’s 
imminent offensive. Long enough, 
sir, for us to complete the deploy- 
ment of our nova inducers.” 

The general seized onto that 
thought. “Yes, the Empire must be 
stopped. The conquests* of that 
madman must be brought to an 
end!” His eyes narrowed, and his 
voice lowered. “He is mad, you 
know, colonel. Thinks he’s the 
reincarnation of a 20th century 
British actor. He — ” 

“Sir? About the plan?” 

Eastland stared blankly for a 
moment, then nodded. “Continue.” 
“Since Sir Alec is a Zen- Baptist, 
it is forbidden for him to use com-

puters or magnetic data storage. 
When he came to power, he had all 
the information in his empire trans- 
cribed into bound volumes. These 
volumes were placed in a planet he 
had hollowed out and made into a 
library.” 

‘‘I fail to see what this has to do 
with delaying the offensive,” East- 
land said. 

“I’m getting, to that, sir. Our lat- 
est intelligence reveals something 
that Sir Alec managed to keep se- 
cret for many years. The assasi na- 
tion attempt made against him by 
the Sirian underground left him 
blind. He retained control of his 
empire, but he is plagued by feel- 
ings of great inadequacy. By way of 
compensation, he did things to 
handicap those around him. He de- 
creed that each volume in his 
library-planet was to be replaced by 
an audio disk containing the same 
information. 

“My plan is this, sir: Intelligence 
has determined the exact coordi- 
nates of the section of the planet 
where the battle plans are stored. I 
will pilot a one-man ship through 
hyperspace to those coordinates. 
Thus I avoid the planet’s defensive 



forces. Dropping out of hyperspace, 
I’ll scan the disks containing the 
battle plans. Jumping back into 
hyperspace, I’ll escape cleanly. The 
piloting will be very tricky, but I 
believe that an experienced pilot, 
such as myself, has a chance at pull- 
ing it off.” 

Braun assumed, simply because 
the general was looking in his direc- 
tion, that he had his attention. East- 
land’s eyes, however, were glazed, 
and his mind, far away. 

“With their plans in our hands,” 
Braun said, “They will have to 
abort their offensive. This would 
buy us the time we need to insure 
our victory.” Very pleased with 
himself, he looked expectantly at 
the general. Eastland continued to 
stare. After a considerable pause, 
Braun asked, “Sir?” 

Eastland jerked his head slightly, 
and focused his eyes on Braun. 
What had the man been saying, he 
wondered. Something about coming 
out of hyper space inside a planet ? 
“Just what do you hope to accom- 
plish by this stunt, colonel?” 

“This stunt, sir, should get me 
into the Guinness World of book 
records.” ★ 



STAR WARRING 



59 




1 his will be my fourth annual 
report on the State of the 

Sciences — that is. I’ve just attended 
the annual meeting of the A A AS, 
and it’s time to review what’s going 
on. 

There’s a lot. Before this is over 
you’ll hear of the proof of immor- 
tality, see projections of history out 
farther than anyone I know of has 
ever looked, get the latest on the 
search for extra-terrestrial in- 

telligence (SETI), and learn what’s 
coming next in climate (warmer for 
a hundred years, Ice Age expected 
in a thousand). But first the real 
news. 

The theme of the A A AS meeting 
this year was “the tools of sci- 
ence,’’ although there wasn’t really 
very much more emphasis on such 
things than there has been in the 
past. What made it peculiarly 
appropriate is rather personal to 
me — I’m writing this on my own 
computer. And I love it. The only 

60 



thing that bugs me is that after I get 
this all nicely composed on my 
monitor screen, it will be typed and 
shipped off to Mr. Pierce, who will 
mark it up and hand it to someone 
to type into another computer; one 
would think that I could send a tape 
or disk, bypassing all that (and in- 
cidentally giving the author final 
control over the text; hmmm; 
perhaps I have discovered why 
editors are not overjoyed by the 
new systems). 

In any event, my Z-80 system 
works, and even gives me a running 
count of the words, making it no 
end easier for all concerned. (Inci- 
dentally, although authors tradition- 
ally complain about copy editing— 
an obscene act performed by one 
consenting adult and one non- 
consenting author — I really have 
had no grounds for unhappiness at 
GALAXY’s hands, either with Jim 
Baen or John Pierce. 

I am tempted to do my entire 

GALAXY 



column about my computer system. 
1 type onto a TV screen, edit by 
moving words and lines and blocks 
of type around electronically, and 
when I’ve done I go have coffee 
while the machine types the manu- 
script. Incredible. Even more in- 
credible is that my computer, mine, 
the one sitting here in this room, is 
more powerful than was the world’s 
best system back when I started in 
the aerospace business. But enough; 
let’s get on with the column. 



★ ★ ★ 

Science marches on. There 
wasn’t anything really spectacular in 
this year’s meeting; just a confirma- 
tion of trends that we’ve seen be- 
fore. There weren’t any wild disap- 
pointments, either, except for the 
ammouncement that one of the shut- 
tles would never go to space. Those 
fans who worked to get the first 
ship’s name changed to “Enter- 
prise” have legitimate grounds for 
complaint: that’s the one the Ad- 
ministration has chosen to cancel. 
Enterprise will never go to space, 
and I for one can’t help thinking 
there’s a kind of grim vengeance in 
that. 

It was mildly amusing to listen to 
Mr. Carter’s spokesman explain 
why killing one of the shuttles 
would be good for science. Of 
course one had to hang onto one’s 
sense of humor. A few of those lis- 
tening couldn’t, and asked just how 
it might help the sciences to kill off 
some 25 percent of our capability for 
going to space. T heard no very 
satisfactory answer to that. The 
theory is that the money saved will 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



be available to other science pro- 
jects, but none of the lucky reci- 
pients was named, and you can be- 
lieve as much of the theory as you 
want. 

Enough gloom. I really don’t 
want to write a political column. 

SETI. Surely the sc'- ch for 
others out there is worth a note. No 
alien intelligence has been found, of 
course, although enthusiasts con- 
tinue to listen. Their efforts have 
been hampered by the limits of their 
receivers: there are just a lot of pos- 
sible channels on which the others 
might be talking, and we don’t have 
much spare radio-telescope time 
anyway. Thus it would make sense 
to listen to a very large number of 
channels all at once. The only prob- 
lem is that no one has ever built a 
one-million channel receiver. 

The “how to” of such a receiver 
has been known for years. It 
wouldn’t even be expensive, at least 
not by Federal standards — under 
five million dollars, probably under 
half that. So why has it never been 
done? 

Because no one ever asked for 
the money. NASA’s budget people 
are terrified that if they ask for a 
couple of megabucks for a receiver 
with which to listen for alien in- 
telligence, Senator Proxmire will (a) 
refuse the request, (b) denounce 
NASA and perhaps hand them his 
“Golden Fleece Award,” and (c) 
wreak terrible vengeance by chop- 
ping out several tens of millions 
from the NASA request. 

Although this is hardly a 
courageous stand on NASA’s part, 
it is, alas, rather realistic. This 
year, though, it is said that NASA 
will screw up its courage and ask 



61 




for the million-channel receiver for 
listening to possible messages from 
Out There. Watch for Proxmire’s 
reactions. 

★ * * 

There was a lot of attention to the 
weather at this year’s AAAS meet- 
ing. I don’t suppose that comes as 
much of a surprise, given the terri- 
ble weather we’ve had lately. I wish 
I had good news, but in fact, the 
consensus of opinion among the 
weather and climate people is that 
things are likely to get worse, not 
better. 

According to the long-range 
weather prediction people, what 
we’ve experienced the last couple of 
years is “normal;” what was ab- 
normal, and we have no right to 
expect for the future, is the extraor- 
dinarily good weather of the past 
two to three years. 

Now things are getting back to 
normal, and if that turns out not to 
be our liking, well, the universe 
never promised us anything differ- 
ent. The normal climate generates 
highly variable weather. For reasons 
not clearly understood, during the 
50’s and 60’s the weather wasn’t 
very variable, and the climate was 
highly benign. For the future, if you 
don’t like the weather, wait a few 
decades. It will probably change. 

That turns out to have a number 
of consequences, of course. For the 
moment famine is at a minimum; 
there are comparatively few areas of 
the world in which starvation is a 
major contributor to the death rate. 
Given drastic changes in climate — 
and we now have good reason to 
expect such massive changes — there 

62 



will be nothing for it: either we in- 
crease productivity, or famine stalks 
the land again. Not, of course, our 
land. We won’t starve; but the uni- 
verse has so arranged things that if 
there are to be major gains in ag- 
ricultural productivity, they will al- 
most certainly come about through 
intensive use of western technology 
transplanted to the ‘developing 
nations’ — or they will not come 
about at all. Whether we will do the 
necessary development is another 
question. 

* * * 

Last year I reported that physi- 
cists were challenging the General 
Theory of Relativity. I may not 
have put it precisely that way; what 
I said was that top physicists were 
fairly sure that within the century 
they would have unified field 
theory. That, however, implies the 
overthrow of General Relativity, 
because GR treats gravity as a 
phenomenon fundamentally different 
from the 'forces’ of nature such as 
electro-magnetism. In General Rel- 
ativity, gravity results from distor- 
tions in the fabric of space itself; it 
is not really a ‘force’ at all. 

Incidentally, Einstein himself 
searched for a unified field theory, 
something to relate gravity to the 
other forces, and although he in- 
vented GR, he didn’t believe in it. 

At any event, the trend is toward 
unification of the fundamental 
forces, as shown in Figure One. 

There are also continued attempts 
to describe the universe in simple 
terms — that is, what with all the 
elementary particles floating around, 
theory has become very complex,

the Greeks and their early “atomic” 
models. Aldous Huxley once re- 
marked that it made no difference 
whether the universe “really” con- 
formed to the simplest explanation, 
or scientists were just not capable of 
understanding anything else; and 
possibly there is an impulse to 
simplicity rooted in the human 
psyche. Occam’s razor need not 
have anything to do with the real 
world. Yet — there are intriguing 
hints that the universe may after all 
be built more simply than it ap- 
pears. 

For instance, there is that intrigu- 
ing number 10 40 which appears so 
often. The age of the universe, cal- 
culated in units of the time re- 
quired for light to cross an atomic 
nucleus; the diameter of the uni- 
verse in units of nuclear diameters; 
the ratio of the strongest (strong 
nuclear) to the weakest (gravity) 
known force. There is also the mass 
of the universe as measured in mas- 
ses of elementary particles; that 
turns out to be 10 4n squared, no 
small number, but there is that 
pesky 10 40 again. 

And of course it may be pure 
coincidence. “What does it all 
mean, Mr. Natural?”

Let’s see. What else? You must 
remember, a AAAS meeting is a 
five-ring circus, and every day there 
is far more to do and see than you can 
possibly get to. This year it was a 
bit easier, because there were more 
of ‘us;’ in addition to Larry Niven 
and myself and Mrs. Poumelle, 
there were from the SF community 
Mr. and Mrs. Frank Herbert, Joe and 



Gay Haldeman, David Gerroid, 
Charles Sheffield, Karl Pflock, Ben 
and Barbara Bova, and probably 
some others I don’t remember; this 
made it a bit easier to trade notes 
on various sessions, although it also 
made for longer nights. Inciden- 
tally, we found a very good Af- 
ghanistan! restaurant near the Shera- 
ton Park, where we enjoyed good 
food while Frank and Bev Herbert 
regaled us with stories of their visit 
to the Khyber Pass. 

There was also a science fiction 
writers’ panel; it was well attended 
and seemed to be enjoyed by those 
whose who came. Panelists Bova, 
Gerroid, and Herbert spoke of mat- 
ters science fiction, probably appro- 
priate for the audience. For myself I 
would have preferred that they do 
SF rather than talk about it, but I 
was probably alone in that wish. 

* * * 

The single most fascinating ses- 
sion of the AAAS meeting was a 
panel entitled ‘ ‘ Prospects for Life in 
the universe: the ultimate limits to 
growth.” Chaired by William Gale 
of the Bell Telephone Labs, it fea- 
tured former astronaut Brian 
O’Leary, Freeman Dyson, Dr. Gale 
himself, Gregg Edwards of NSF, 
and Carl Sagan as discussant. Since 
neither Dyson nor Sagan can read 
the telephone book aloud without 
making it interesting, that was ob- 
viously the one panel not to miss, 
and none of us did. It began prosai- 
cally enough, with von Puttkamer 
of NASA projecting space indus- 
trialization over the next 25 years; it 
ended with the damdest thing I’ve 
ever seen. Understand — in a sense.

GALAXY 




these were amateurs at my business, 
and in fact a great deal of the panel 
was a bit like that, scientists playing 
science fiction writer with no more 
spectacular success than most SF 
writers; that is, until Freeman 
Dyson gave his paper. 

Before Dyson we had O’Leary on 
asteroid mining and space coloniza- 
tion, themes we’ve dealt with in 
this column and elsewhere. Not 
surprisingly, O’Leary recommends 
use of the O’Neill “mass driver” 
(O’Leary is O’Neill’s associate at 
Princeton) to move asteroids 
around. The mass driver is that 
gizmo so beloved by science fiction 
writers, a kind of electronic catapult 
to fling ships — or buckets of goo — 
into space. Drivers don’t work from 
Earth, but they will from the Moon, 
and certainly from an asteroid. 

The usual SF story uses the 
driver to launch ships; Mr. Heinlein 
used one to launch capsules in The 
Moon Is A Harsh Mistress , and a 
few stories have had the drivers 
launching raw materials from the 
lunar surface. The latter is the con- 
cept O’Neill’s plan for space col- 
onies employs. O’Leary’s presenta- 
tion proposed using the driver to 
move an asteroid: power the driver 
with solar cells, and use chunks of 
the asteroid as reaction mass. I’ve 
often spoken of the concept in my 
lectures, but whether I heard it first 
from O’Neill’s people I don’t know. 
Certainly it would work. 

It takes, according to O’Leary’s 
figures, about 4,000 tons of equip- 
ment to haul in an asteroid. And 
one asteroid brought to high Earth 
orbit could provide all the materials 
needed to build enough Solar Power 
Satellites to power the entire world 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



by the year 2000. As O’Leary was 
speaking I made the note “Hell, it’s 
my lecture;” which may not strictly 
be true, but it’s close enough. We 
certainly could, by the year 2000, 
power the world from sapce, and 
we could do it without bankrupting 
ourselves — I’ve said all this before 
in other columns, and although the 
temptation is severe I’ll leave the 
topic alone here. 

The next lecture was by Dr. Gale 
of Bell Labs, and once again it was 
a bit like listening to my own 
presentation — not that Dr. Gale didn’t 
say some things I don’t, but 
the theme was remarkably similar to 
my “Survival With Style,” at least 
at first. He began by reviewing the 
limits to growth on Earth itself; they 
are, not surprisingly, pretty severe, 
although not as severe as the 
Zero-Growth people like to pos- 
tulate. 

The solar system, however, pro- 
vides somewhat more room. It 
could furnish for each of a sextillion 
(that’s 10 21 ) people: 200 tons of 
hydrogen; five tons of iron; five 
tons of glass; 400 pounds of oxy- 
gen; 400 pounds of carbon; and 
50,000 kilo Watt-hours of energy. 
Perhaps that’s life on the cheap, and 
we wouldn’t want the full sextillion 
people living here, so adjust the 
available wealth according to the 
population you like. 

Dr. Gale then reviewed starship 
systems, none going faster than 
light, and not surprisingly con- 
cluded that they are quite feasible if 
a bit expensive. Again, so far, not a 
lot new; but he also pointed out that 
given the limits of a solar system, 
the impulse to build starships must 
be reasonably high. We could go 



65 




make use of other stars. 

There’s only one problem with 
that — someone else may want the 
materials. In fact, if you play expo- 
nential growth games, it will be 
only a few thousand years before 
humanity will have spread far 
throughout the Galaxy, and may 
well be tearing stars apart and mov- 
ing big things around — see my col- 
umn “That Buck Rogers Stuff” for 
more details — and if we are pretty 
near that stage, why haven’t others 
done it? Those are effects we would 
probably see. 

Thus, perhaps we are alone in 
this galaxy — and according to Dr. 
Gale, that may be as well, because 
in far fewer than a million years we 
will want it all for ' ourselves. 
Meanwhile it’s a race — and he does 
not discount the possibility of a race 
to another galaxy so that we can lay 
claim before someone else does. 
And do note: if you project human 
progress and use that as a model, it 
is strange that the ‘outsiders’ are not 
here yet. (Devotees of the UFO per- 
suasion have their own ideas on 
that.) 

In fact, Gale notes, there is no 
reason why within a few tens of 
thousands of years humanity will 
not be interfering with the evolution 
of the universe: preventing lovely 
and useful matter and energy from 
collapsing into Black Holes where 
we can’t get at it; making stars 
grow in the direction we want and 
need; etc. There is, Gale concludes, 
no limit to growth except to meet 
someone else as powerful as we 
who needs the growth materials we 
must have. On that note he ended. 

But — of course there is a limit. 
The universe itself is not eternal. It 

66 



can’t last forever. 

It can’t — but perhaps we can, 
says Freeman Dyson. 

No one could ever accuse Dyson 
of thinking small. His “Dyson 
Spheres” or “Dyson Shells,” large 
systems for trapping the energy of 
the sun so that not so much is 
wasted, were the inspiration for 
Larry Niven’s Ringworld and 
Shaw’s Orbitsville and a number of 
other stories. Although I didn’t get 
the concept from him, Dyson was 
the first non-sf type I know of who 
examined the space industrialization 
possibilities implied by the laser- 
launching system I’ve employed in 
many stories. He is a modem re- 
naissance man who thinks both 
broadly and deeply. 

He began simply enough, by 
quoting from Stephen Weinberg’s 
The First Three Minutes. Like many 
modem cosmologists, Weinberg 
finds that the universe is doomed, 
and that disturbs him. He says 
“The more the universe seems 
comprehensible, the more it seems 
pointless.” 

Of course nearly all religions 
have taught that “the world” 
(which certainly implies ‘universe’) 
will inevitably come to an end. The 
Last Trump will sound either from 
Heirndall’s horn or Gabriel’s. Then 
too, true atheist humanism has 
never had any answer to the feeling 
that it is all pointless; of course it 
is. (This is, incidentally, discussed 
brilliantly and at length in Henri de 
Lubac, S.J., The Drama of Atheist 
Humanism, Meridian 1963.) It is 
only a true modem who can proc- 
laim that the universe has no pur- 
pose (in the sense that it is no more 
than a dance of the atoms) and at

the same time bewail its pointless 
impermanence. 

Dyson, however, did not address 
the theology of the universe; he 
stayed strictly within its physics, 
looking at the probable futures. The 
first result of this is given in Figure 
Three. 

Now note that last number: 
10 1078 . To the best of my 
recollection — and that of all the 
others in attendance at the panel — 
no one has ever tried to project the 
future that far before; but then, one 
leams to expect great things from 
Freeman Dyson. 

He was not finished, though. 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



Granted that 10 1078 is a large 
number, still, it is finite; the uni- 
verse does eventually come to an 
end. However — do we have to? 

Now that sounds like a silly ques- 
tion. How can we survive the end 
of the universe? 

First a question: is the basis of 
consciousness matter or structure? 
That is equivalent to asking whether 
sentient black clouds or sentient 
computers are possible: can we, in 
other words, make a one-for-one 
transformation of a conscious being, 
replacing part for part, and still 
have a conscious entity? And will it 
be the same entity? 



67 




Note that this is also equivalent 
to asking whether you could send a 
conscious being by wire — tear down 
the original and transmit a message 
that would cause an exact recon- 
struction at the other end. 

If this is possible, then the se- 
cond question: are biological entities 
subject to scaling? One presumes 
that if the basis of consciousness is 
structure, not the physical matter, 
then indeed we are subject to scal- 
ing: that we could build a one-for- 
one transform of ourselves, into 
computers, or into biological pro- 
cesses, that could be so scaled that 
the subjective life time is infinite. 

Dyson then proceeded to demon- 
strate this with what I call the “In- 
tegrals of Immortality.” I haven’t 
room to reproduce them here, and I 
suspect that even freshman calculus 
would turn off my readers, but in- 
deed they exist, and given the as- 
sumptions Dyson has indeed “pro- 
ved” the possibility of an infinite 
conscious lifetime — which is to say 
that for all time a properly con- 
structed entity could accumulate 
new experiences and fresh informa- 
tion, running out of neither experi- 
ences not time in which to enjoy 
them. 

Couple that with the Goedel 
theorem of mathematics which 
states that there is no limit to 
growth: there will always be new 
questions which cannot be answered 
without new assumptions, which 
will themselves generate new 
questions which cannot be answered 
in that system: and you have some- 
thing to think about. 

Quite an exciting panel. As I said 
when it was over, I had gone to the 
panel expecting something interest- 

68 



ing, but after all these were more or 
less amateurs at my business (far 
out speculation about the future); I 
certainly wasn’t prepared for im- 
mortality and 10 1 " 76 years! 

Carl Sagan’s discussion was on 
aliens: any moderate extrapolation 
of human capabilities shows that 
within a thousand years we are 
likely to be visiting other stars — 
either physically, or certainly with 
messages. Thus Fermi’s question: 
Where Are The Others? They 
should have been here by now. 

Sagan examined several pos- 
sibilities. 

First, perhaps we are very early. 
This Sagan rejects — our sun is not 
very old compared to the age of the 
galaxy, and almost certainly there 
have been others. (Assuming that 
there are ever going to be others. 
Continuing along that line takes us 
to theology, and is outside the 
scope of this column; for our pur- 
poses we assume that life can come 
about given the right physical condi- 
tions, and that having come about it 
evolves. This is not, so far as I 
know, at all inconsistent with reli- 
gion, or at least with the Catholic 
religion. 

Secondly, then, perhaps high- 
level of capabiity they destroy 
themselves. We can certainly come 
up with scenarios in which that 
happens to us, and it’s something to 
think about. 

Third, perhaps advances in biol- 
ogy bring about immortality, and 
that in turn changes motivations, 
specifically, that immortality re- 
moves the imperative for coloniza- 
tion and expansion. I find this un- 
lifely; I would think that for immor- 
tals would still have an imperative 

GALAXY 




for exploration at the very least; I 
find Larry Niven’s ancient Louis 
Wu quite believable. 

Fourth, there is the “zoo” 
hypothesis: we are either on exhibi- 
tion, or somehow subject to non- 
interference regulations. Obviously 
this is not a new idea for science 
fiction readers; what’s interesting is 
that it could be presented to a bunch 
of scientists without getting a laugh. 

Finally, Sagan speculates, 
perhaps technologies not much be- 
yond ours are so much more ad- 
vanced that we simply cannot im- 
agine them: the effects of really ad- 
vanced technologies are not recog- 
nized by us. If so, we have an in- 
teresting future in store —because no 
question about it, we are already 
approaching the point at which we 
could make others unambiguously 
aware of our existence. 

Sagan was followed by a chap 
from the State Department, who 
said among other things that we are 
now learning to look far into the 
future, and this is “particularly 
due to the work of people 
like Carl Sagan.” Now I have no- 
thing but admiration for Sagan, and 
I shouldn’t like to take anything 
from his reputation; but I think he 
would be among the first to say that 
much of his speculation is a bit old 
hat to science fiction writers and 
fans; and my feeling as I listened to 
the State Department chap was 
“They’re doing it to us again!” In 
fact, after listening to the scientists 
congratulate themselves over hav- 
ing, finally, allowed at one of their 
meetings some elementary specula- 
tions of the kind that have gone on 
in SF convention panels for de- 
cades, I very nearly titled this col- 



umn “Out In The Cold Again;” 
however that would be uncharitable, 
and I am truly grateful for the op- 
portunity to have heard Dyson. 

It isn’t as if it were unknown for 
SF people to steal from the scien- 
tists; now we get a dose of our 
medicine. 

It doesn’t taste very good, but 
what the hell. 

★ ★ ★ 

As usual I’m running our of 
space before I can cover even half 
of what went on at the meeting; but 
I can’t end without mentioning the 
dinosaurs. 

Warm-blooded dinosaurs. I didn’t 
get to the panel, but I did attend the 
press conference. There’s something 
mind-boggling about the whole 
thing: how to understand, from a 
few scraps of bone and fossil, the 
physiology of critters that died away 
60 million years ago. 

They were, after all, rather suc- 
cessful: dinosaurs, ranging in size 
from about that of a modem wild 
turkey to beasts massing 80 tons 
live weight, dominated the planet 
for nearly 100 million years. Most 
of them were big. According to the 
panel chaired by Dr. Everett Olson 
of UCLA, more than 50 percent of 
the dinosaurs were larger than all 
but two percent of the mammals; 70 
to 80 percent of the mammals alive 
today are smaller than the smallest 
dinosaur. 

As Olson said this, something 
occurred to me: if they were so 
large, their major problem would be 
getting rid of heat. They are on the 
wrong side of the surface to volume 
relationship, just as an overweight 

69 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 




person finds it very difficult to lose 
a few pounds. (There ain’t no jus- 
tice: it’s easy for a thin person to 
reduce.) I mentioned that in the 
question period and found that this 
seems to be a relatively new 
idea — not that I thought of it first, 
but that the biologists concerned 
with the dinosaurs have only in the 
last couple of years looked at the 
beasties from that point of view. 

However — Walt Disney did pre- 
sent the “overheat” model of di- 
nosaur extinction in “Fantasia,” as 
Olson pointed out to me; and look- 
ing at the long-term climate models, 
there’s at least a chance that this is 
what happened to them. They 
cooked in their own juices. 

It’s all complicated because we 
are not even sure where the conti- 
nents were when the dinosaurs 
flourished: it has been that long, 
and they were around for a very 
long time. If you rearrange the land 
masses to the best guesses of the 
configuration back 100 million 
years ago, nearly all the dinosaurs 
lived within 40 to 50 degrees of the 
equator — except that there is re- 
ported a fossil print from 
Spitsbergen and no one is sure that 
Spitzbergen was that far south even 
back then. 

There was no real conclusion, 
and my apologies for taking your 
time with the question. It interests 
me, even if the best I can say about 
warm-blooded dinosaurs is that 
“nobody thinks they all were 
‘warm-blooded’ but many respecta- 
ble paleobiologists think some were; 
a few think none were.” As to what 
killed them all off, there aren’t any 
fewer theories now than there were 
a few years ago. 

70 



And at least some theorists say 
that the waim-blooded dinosaurs 
became birds, and the cold-blooded 
ones died or became reptiles, and 
what’s all the problem? 

* ★ * 

The final controversy was over 
sociobiology, and that’s important 
enough to warrant a full column one 
day. At the A A AS meeting the 
usual group calling itself the 
“Committee Against Racism” 
showed up to enforce its idea of 
scientific integrity by preventing Dr. 
Wilson from speaking: their brilliant 
idea was to shout “Wilson, you’re 
all wet!” and pour water on him, 
obviously refuting his ideas. Sigh. 

But for all that, it was a quiet 
meeting, not like the one a few 
years ago when the “concerned” 
whatever they were hit Senator — 
then Vice President — Hubert Hum- 
phrey right smack in the mush with 
a ripe tomato, or the one in San 
Francisco at which the Racism 
Committee tried to quiet Sydney 
Hook. 

I usually like to summarize the 
year in science, but this year it is 
difficult. The mood was one of op- 
timism for the technological and 
scientific advances of the year, and 
profound gloom because of the pre- 
vailing attitude of government. 

We can do a lot. Every year the 
discoveries come forth, and the 
promise of the future gets brighter; 
but for the moment at least there’s 
the question of whether we will do 
anything about bringing forth that 
promise. 

We have the tools. We may not 
have the will. ★

THE STARS IN SHROUD 



Ling Sanjen has followed a 
career as an officer in Fleet, the 
military arm of the vast interstellar 
Empire man has forged by faster- 
than-light ships (Jump ships) and 
the slower ramscoop vessels. Ling 
is an ofkaipan — a despised outsider 
in the predominantly Mongol cul- 
ture, a synthesis of Chinese, 
Japanese and southeast Asian 
societies. This is all that remains of 
the human race; the other nations 
of Old Earth were wiped out in the 
Riot War. 

Ling is one of the first Fleet 
officers to come into contact with a 
strange new disorder, the Plague. It 
is a crushing fear of open spaces 
and light, apparently brought on by 
an alien species, the Quarn. A full- 
scale war develops between Fleet 
and the Quarn, but so little is 
known of the enemy that Fleet is 
virtually powerless. No Quarn na- 
tive worlds are known. Ling makes 
the first raid to bring back survivors 
of a Quarn “attack” on the planet 
Regeln. On Regeln Ling finds 
people crowded into foul pas- 
sageways and self-made piles of 
mud and stone, erected to shield out 
the enormity of open space. The 
survivors are gibbering, mindless 
cases. 

Ling's men evacuate some sur- 
vivors. Returning to Earth, the crew 
itself begins to develop Plague-like 
symptoms. The clearest sign of this 
is the failure of the Sabal Game, an 
elaborate public ritual the Empire 
has made a virtual state religion. 
The Game reinforces social solidar- 
ity and feelings of group coopera- 
tion. To Ling, Sabal is an important 
emotional factor in his life, the un- 
derpinning to his ability to lead. He 

72 



leads his ship’s Sabal Game on the 
flight Earthward and the Game dis- 
solves into strife and self-seeking 
among the players — exactly the op- 
posite of what the Game should 
achieve. 

Ling sees now that the Game is 
the key to the Quarn assault on 
man. The mysterious Plague 
spreads through the Game, using 
man’s psychological weaknesses 
against him. Ling decides to not 
bring the survivors to Earth. Ling’s 
executive . officer, Tonji, brushes 
aside these ideas. He invokes a 
Fleet rule against Ling and brings 
the ship to Earth. Ling is court 
martialed for delaying the return of 
the survivors, which Fleet wanted to 
examine. An ofkaipan, he is quickly 
convicted. Only Ling sees that these 
survivors will spread the illness on 
Earth, but he is ignored. By this 
time the disease has affected him, 
too, and then his family. 

For a long year he lives in de- 
spair with his wife, Angela, and his 
children Chark and Romana. They 
live in the Slots, cramped buildings 
housing the ill. But gradually Ling 
recovers, for unknown reasons. He 
ventures out of the Slots and is 
picked up by a Fleet guard. Fleet is 
interested in recovery cases and 
after studying him, they offer him his 
old rank. Tonji himself offers a post 
on the planet Veden, a key interstel- 
lar ramscoop freight terminal. 
Barely suppressing his hatred of 
Tonji, Ling accepts. Angela protests 
his leaving Earth but Ling goes 
anyway, drawn by the urge to act. 

Tonji’ s offer was a barbed one. 
Veden is in a double-star system. 
There is a hot blue star, Lekki, and 
circling it a neutron star, Jagen. 

GALAXY 




The precious Jump ships are no 
longer used to drop passengers 
safely near Veden; instead, Ling 
must loop near Jagen, losing energy 
through a gravitational slingshot ef- 
fect, to reach Veden. He survives 
— barely^and resolves to settle the 
score someday with Tonji. 

PART III 
1 

I fell toward Veden, toward 
rebirth. It might be possible, a new 
beginning. My fuel was spent. If 
the pickup shuttle failed to reach me, 
I would take a long, smooth ellipse 
down into her. Flame like a coal, 
fall a cinder. A sacrifice to her 
regal orbit, marred only by an ani- 
mal cry of despair at frequencies to 
which she never listened. 

Who did she hear spinning with 
ancient purpose? To Lekki, Star of 
India? Or to the dark mote that 
raced with frantic energy, the Neu- 
tron Being? 

Gods and planets do not speak. 
She would not say. 

“Have you on visual,” my suit 
spoke to me. “If you can drop a lit- 
tle lower. I’ll match on my present 
trajectory.” 

I thumbed on my binocs, but 
without a referent I couldn’t pick 
out the shuttle. I stretched my arms 
and legs as far as the cylinder 
allowed — it was conveniently 

casket-sized — and unlocked the jet 
plates. A slight nudge forward. A 
tug of acceleration at my back. The 
shuttle came sliding up from the 
white rim of Veden as though on an 
invisible wire, sure and swift and 
impersonal, a black spot against the 

THE STARS IN SHROUD 



muted whites and blues. Veden 
swept closer, serene as though in 
meditation, soundless. 

“Your course is bracketed,” the 
shuttle pilot’s voice came through 
thinly in the crackle and hiss of my 
suit radio. “Secure attitude control 
board.” 

I never tire of the stately ma- 
neuvering of craft in orbit. They 
move as though some unheard 
rhythm times them, unperturbed and 
answerable to no one. The shuttle 
drifting toward me gave the perfect 
illusion of freedom. But it was 
doomed to fall into the sea of air 
below us and regain its mortality, 
be weathered and aged even as men 
are. 

The shuttle jetted gas, blurring 
the crisp outlines of Veden below it 
like heat waves on a warm af- 
ternoon. Heavy shielding around the 
common pod identified it as an at- 
mospheric craft. Delicate spines of 
antennas would be retracted before 
the atmosphere could sear them 
away at reentry. 

A black rectangle grew in its 
side. I coasted straight into it. In- 
side harsh violet lights winked on 
and I could see the braking pads 
standing out from the walls of the 
pickup port. 

Why violet? I blinked. The af- 
terimage faded very slowly. My 
polarizers had compensated almost 
immediately, but the instant of lag 
had been enough to blind me in one 
spot of my vision field for more 
than a minute. 

I watched the port grow, using my 
peripheral vision. The shuttle was 
outfitted for a variety of tasks. Grap- 
ples tucked under the belly, waldo 
arms recessed beneath the pilot’s 

73 




slot, and a long thin cut ran down 
its side — from there would come the 
thin delta wings for skipping along 
the top of the atmosphere. 

“I’m coming in nicely,” I said. 
The violet rectangle grew, filled the 
port. We hit the pads gently. I 
heard a faint clank as something 
wrapped around the outside. 

“Contacts register correctly,” the 
pilot said. “Are you familiar with 
the mechanism for securing — ?” 

“I’ll mention it if I have any 
trouble,” I said. “But why the col- 
ored light? It’s rather difficult to see 
in here.” I popped the release on 
the capsule hatch and the violet 
came flooding in. It would have 
been unbearable without polarizers. 
I pushed off gently with my elbows, 
drifted out of the capsule and up to 
the ceiling. 

“Oh, I’m sorry, sir. I’ve got the 
illumination set for Veden surface 
levels. Switching over to Earth 
standard.” 

The violet phospors died and 
white ones flared into brilliance 
above them. Everything was silent, 
except for the small pings of my 
suit contracting as I moved. Gently, 
gently. I remembered my deep 
space work of decades past and kept 
my knees bent, moving slowly and 
thinking through every action. 

The elastic cables fitted into slots 
near the capsule. I reeled them out 
and used a suit jet to swing around 
the capsule in a circle, the line trail- 
ing after me. The third cable grip 
refused to close for a moment when 
I tried to lock it and I was afraid it 
had cold-welded in the open posi- 
tion, but after some tapping, it shut. 
The lines restrained any motion of 
the capsule perpendicular to its axis 
74 



and two axial rods kept it from slid- 
ing out of the cocoon of cables. I 
checked the job twice. If the cap- 
sule with all my luggage in it broke 
loose when we hit the atmosphere, it 
could go straight through the shut- 
tle’s skin. 

“All done,” I spoke into my suit 
mike. The blinker over the exit 
winked twice in confirmation and a 
panel slid back into place, shutting 
out the stars. I slipped through the 
circular exit tube and found it easy 
going because of the mngs inside. 
A few twists and turns following 
the blinkers and I dropped into a 
flight seat. 

“I routed you through to the 
copilot’s spot, sir,” the voice said. 
I turned to my left and saw a small 
man looking at me across an impos- 
ing bulge of hardware. “It’s a more 
comfortable seat than the passenger 
compartment. The view is better 
here, too.” 

His skin was jet black. A Negro? 
But I’d thought none survived the 
Riot War. Something about the 
virus blight that swept down out of 
Europe. 

Then I realized the cabin was il- 
luminated in violet and my polariz- 
ers, had cut in the moment I entered. 
The pilot’s skin must be the muddy 
tan of the Indians, but my polarizers 
deepened it to black. 

“Lance Officer Shandul, sir.” 
He gave an abbreviated salute. I 
nodded back. 

“This is what the sunlight is like 
on Veden, Mr. Shandul?” I waved 
an arm at the phosphors ringing us. 
“I knew it was weighted in the ul- 
traviolet, but I’m not prepared to 
take much of this.” 

“Yes, sir, perhaps I can lower it 

GALAXY 




somewhat. I fear we are not mod- 
ified to permit Earth illumination 
levels here in the cockpit, for which 
I am sorry. Upon reentry we will 
not need interior lights at all. I can 
extinguish them in a few moments. 
I hope it will not be uncomfortable 
for you.” 

“No, no. Just take us down.” I 
looked out the transparent nose of 
the shuttle for the first time. The 
horizon was a sharp brittle line di- 
viding the milky swirls of Veden’s 
oceans and clouds from the obsidian 
depths of nothingness. My polariz- 
ers smothered the stars so that the 
curve of the planet gave way not to 
the glimmering sparks of distant 
life, but to zero, blankness, the fatal 
cold entropy death. Shandul touched 
a control and the ship spun slightly. 
Lekki slid into a comer of my vi- 
sion, screaming to be seen. I glanced 
at it and it turned white. Careless. I 
would have a blind spot there for 
minutes. 

I looked down at Veden. 
(“Down” by training; the anti-g 
pills were working and even peering 
straight down at the surface, I 
didn’t feel the visceral clench of 
infinite, terrifying fall.) Now that I 
knew what her light was like, I 
thought I could see a tinge of re- 
flected violet in the white of the 
clouds. 

“It will require a few moments to 
complete recalculation of orbits, 
sir.” 

“Why? Aren’t we on a one-orbit 
ellipse?” 

“No, sir. The delay in picking 
you up came from the time neces- 
sary for me to complete satellite 
maintenance.” 

I frowned. I had thought the wait 
THE STARS IN SHROUD 



was a little long. “What kind of 
maintenance?’ ’ 

“Micro-meteorite repair for dam- 
age to weather observation devices, 
sir. Also replacement of some failed 
components. We do not have many 
opportunities to get this shuttle into 
orbit of late, so I was ordered to 
finish all the backlog of work up 
here.” 

“Ordered by whom?” 

Shandul glanced at me hesitantly. 
Even through the helmet I could read 
from his expression that he sensed 
the possibility of getting into the 
middle of a dispute between 
officers, and that was the last thing 
he wanted. 

“First officer Majumbdahr, sir. 
We are very poorly supplied with 
chemical fuels here on Veden 
and . ” 

I froze an interested expression 
on my face and stopped listening. A 
technician will ramble on for hours 
about his speciality and it can be 
fascinating, but for the moment I 
wanted to enjoy the view. 

Still, he’d told me something I 
hadn’t expected. It was natural for a 
way-station world like Veden to be 
low on chemical fuels — with a 
population of seventy-odd million 
and low crustal abundances (a scrap 
of a world, really), it couldn’t sup- 
port a major industrial base to man- 
ufacture them, and at transport rates 
on the Jump, Earth certainly wasn’t 
going to ship fuels out here. But 
somehow I’d expected Veden to be 
better off than this . Imagine delaying 
weather satellite repair to save fuel ! 

It was another reminder of how 
unimportant Veden, as a world, was 
in the eyes of Fleet. Veden had 
been a convenient reservation to 



75 




give the Hindics. Slowly, as the 
ramships gathered here and the 
Flinger grew in importance, this 
strange double-star system became 
important. But the real treasure was 
the Dwarf, not Veden. One should 
not mistake the caretaker for the 
king. 

★ ★ ★ 

Clouds like frozen custard slid by 
below. A witches’ wail chorused; 
turbulence as our craft fell. Through 
some scattered holes I could make 
out topography. The dots of ivory 
ice caps at the poles, smothered in 
snow clouds, already lay over the 
curved rim of Veden at this al- 
titude. Below, large lazy oceans 
gave me nothing to see. We fell 
toward the single continent now — 
three thousand klicks long, a great 
rectangular splotch, almost the only 
dry land on the planet. I craned to 
see it. 

We fell faster; rockets snarled to 
slow us. Below, fat-bunched clouds 
like cushions clung to the sharply 
cut coastline of Baslin, mother con- 
tinent of New India. 

It was raw. The battered coast 
gave way to mountains that lanced 
into the interior. A giant had 
stamped down the edges of Baslin 
and plucked up the middle, for now 
a plateau rose in the center. Wind- 
ing fingers of rivers carved and 
slashed at its edges, cutting narrow 
valleys. It was a work uncompleted, 
a stone forgotten when the sculptor 
walked away and threw his tools 
into the empty seas. 

Indian reservation, I thought, 
grimacing at the pun. Beholden, 
like most of the Cooperative Empire 
worlds — dependent on Earth’s ad- 

76 



vanced technology that held off 
alien biospheres, the high-quality 
microelectronics that Earth con- 
trolled, the bioengineering that 
prevented subtle genetic damage from 
abnormal radiation levels. It was 
this last, Earth’s cellular consumma- 
tion devoutly to be wished, that 
held most worlds. 

“Parachute deployed,” Shandul 
called. The sharp crack of the ejec- 
tion snapped me forward against my 
restraining belts. Parachute? Dis- 
sipating velocity with a chute was 
efficient, but most prosperous areas 
didn’t take the trouble. 

We banked above the great mesa. 
Every human on Veden lived there, 
drank from its rivers, peered over 
the edge — if he dared — into the 
boiling hot chaos of the windswept 
lowlands. The jungle was a riot of 
intense magentas and yellows be- 
tween slate-gray peaks that jutted up 
and tore the clouds. 

Below, the river writhed and I 
suddenly recognized it: Tankjor, the 
torrent that bled Baslin’s major 
lake. The Lapis. And on the shores 
of those quiet waters was Kalic, our 
destination, capital of Baslin and 
thus Veden. 

We hit an air pocket with no bot- 
tom and I felt a sudden wave of 
nausea snatch at me. Guiding rock- 
ets fired in synchronization with 
dull slapping thumps that rattled my 
teeth. We banked, slowly. 

Ahead fractured purple and green 
winked from Lapis and the lattice of 
Kalic ’s streets fanned out to greet 
me. We dropped into a low, con- 
fortable glide. Lekki broke from 
behind a virginal white cloud as we 
cleared the stony margin of the last 
peak. 



GALAXY 




A great gray expanse loomed 
ahead. Shandul corrected. The ship 
dropped like a sack of sand again 
and colors tumbled off to my side 
as we turned for final approach. 

A glimpse of tranquil sky framed 
by mountains. A quiet drifting feel- 
ing. The shuttle jarred, rumbled, 
and we were rolling on our landing 
gear, land animals again, slaves of 
gravity. 

The shuttle coasted up to a wing 
of a long low building at the edge 
of a gray field. I could make out a 
mass of men standing in formation. 
As we drew nearer, they stepped off 
into three squares with a delegation 
out front, all casting long shadows 
in the late afternoon. 

“Thank you, sir. If you’ll exit 
through the side — ” Shandul ges- 
tured to a port that slid open. I 
stepped out onto a platform. I 
opened my suit to external pressure 
and a wave of music burst over me. 
It was a long, solemn dirge of some 
complexity, but it grated. More 
appropriate to a wake, perhaps. Or 
it might be a subtle indication of 
how the staff felt about their new 
ofkaipan Director. 

“Greetings, sir!” an officer 
called at my elbow 1 and the troops 
in formation snapped into a salute. I 
tried to make my replying salute as 
clipped and neat as possible, but the 
suit was a hindrance. 

“Mr. Majumbdahr,” I said, 
“your men look very well turned 
out.” It was easy to recognize his 
long jaw line and elaborately curled 
hair from the personnel records I’d 
studied on the Sasenbo. I turned to 
the next man, shorter and obviously 
a purebred Hindic. 

“My compliments to you as well, 

THE STARS IN SHROUD 



Mr. Gharma. I believe Mr. Shandul 
is under your command — he han- 
dled his ship nicely on the trip 
down.” 

All through this my polarizers 
clicked madly off and on as I turned 
at angles to the direct violet glare of 
Lekki, which was setting on the 
horizon. 

“If I can get this off, I can re- 
view the troops,” I said, reaching 
for my helmet. 

Majumbdahr gestured to stop me. 
“Sir, this light is harmful to your 
eyes. We’ve shortened the cere- 
mony to allow for this. A few more 
minutes and we can escort you in- 
side, where it will be more com- 
fortable.” 

I frowned, but said nothing. The 
band broke into a slightly brisker 
tune, heavy on cymbals and drums. 
Probably the Veden anthem. I stood 
still until it was over, returned a last 
salute and followed Gharma and 
Majumbdahr down the ramp to the 
field. We walked along a roped-off 
path in front of the troops with an 
appropriately regal silence and en- 
tered the Fleet Control building. In- 
side there was a medical party wait- 
ing for me. 

“I should think, Mr. Majumb- 
dahr, that a review of the troops 
is standard for the introduction of a 
new Fleet Control Director.” My 
voice carried an edge. 

An officer with surgeon’s insignia 
raised his hand. “I believe Mr. 
Majumbdahr was acting on a re- 
quest by me, sir. We received word 
that you had not been acclimatized 
to Veden, due to the shortness of 
time. I feared exposure to Lekki 
without your polarizers would dam- 
age your retinal tissue.” As he 

77 




spoke, our party walked along a 
dimly lit corridor. I felt awkward 
and irritated, dragging along my 
suit like a slow-witted bear. 

He turned to the rest of them out- 
side a doorway — I noticed his name 
plate read Imirinichin — and said, “I 
believe we can fit contact filters for 
you, sir, without the rest of the 
Control staff following us around. If 
you please?” 

‘‘Yes, surely.” I waved a hand 
and they broke up. Imirinichin and I 
went in the doorway and suddenly 
the world brightened for me. It was 
an ordinary office except for a few 
specialized instruments on one wall. 
I turned to see Imirinichin, a lean 
man with the slow smile and wrin- 
kled eyes of one who jests well, put- 
ting on goggles. 

‘‘The light in here is adjusted to 
be comfortable for you, and toler- 
able for me if I wear these. If you’ll 
sit in that chair — ” 

A nurse came in wearing the 
same goggles and helped me lower 
my bulk into place. She expertly 
unfastened my helmet. In a moment 
I was free of the suit and no longer 
feeling like a turtle caught in a sand 
pit. She lowered a cantilevered 
mask over my face, fitted twin 
cylinders to my eyes with care and 
flipped a switch. 

The room went dark and a com- 
petent hum came from the apparatus 
around me. In a moment the com- 
puter had measured my comea, 
made inquiries with my retinal 
cells, mused over the patterns of red 
blood vessels, and switched itself 
off. The mask came away. 

‘‘The first thing a newcomer 
notices is the high ultraviolet con- 
tent of Lekki. Exposure to it will 

78 



bum out a man’s retinal tissue in a 
few days. There’s infrared in inten- 
sities sufficient to keep the planet’s 
ecological processes going — 
photosynthesis and so forth — but the 
atmosphere can’t filter out enough 
of the violet to make it comfortable 
for eyes that were developed in the 
green jungles of Earth.” 

‘‘So what do I do?” I should 
have expected something of the sort 
as soon as I popped out of Jump 
space and saw Lekki. 

‘‘Well, it’s no problem — your 
contacts are being made up now.” 

I blinked and popped my two 
lenses into my hand. ‘‘Store these, 
then.” Like ninety nine point some- 
thing of the human race, I wore or- 
dinary contacts. (Interesting: Hu- 
manitarian though universal medical 
care may be, Darwin was right. 
We’ve had nine centuries to prove 
him right. Bad genes linger; we’ve 
insured that, from defective eyesight 
alone, not one human in ten could 
survive a day in the draughted Af- 
rica where the race was bom.) 

A chime rang. A tiny box popped 
from a chute transport slot. In a 
moment tears ran down my face as 
I tried to fit in contacts that nearly 
covered my entire cornea. I wrin- 
kled my face. 

“They must be that large, sir, to 
protect the entire eye,” Imirinichin 
said. “These make the best of a bad 
situation. The original colonists de- 
veloped them.” 

I looked up into a room bathed in 
dusky twilight. The contacts filtered 
out most of Sol-normal light. Im- 
irinichin was nearly blind in this 
room. 

“No, even worse,” he said when 
I asked. “I’m adapted. Permanent 

GALAXY 




colonists — and that’s nearly ev- 
eryone on Veden; we are — ” he 
glanced downward — “somewhat 

isolated . well, they have their 
retinal patterns altered, cell grafts, 
tincturing, all to accommodate Lek- 
ki’s spectrum. The alteration is 
much more comfortable than the 
contacts you’re wearing.” 
“Permanent, though.” 

“Yes. I gather you are here on 
rotating assignment?” 

I nodded. I couldn’t hope to be 
kept in service after what the Coun- 
cil called the “current crisis” was 
over. If it was ever over. 

“No skin treatments, then, for 
you.” 

“Or else I’d have to live near an 
F-sequence star thereafter?’ ’ 

“Yes. Veden would never have 
been colonized but for the Flinger. 
Adaptation is irreversible.” 

“What about bioadapts?” 

“I’ll send the injections around in 
the morning. Also the formal Fleet 
uniform for Veden. It covers you 
nearly completely, sir.” 

“From the ultraviolet.” I shook 
my head. “But . when do I see 
normal colors again?” 

Imirinichin looked chagrined. 
“We can’t get compensation over 
the entire spectrum. Colors will be 
shifted and changed for you. I hope 
it will not be of great inconveni- 
ence ...” 

2 

Science is spectrum analysis; art 
came into the world with photosyn- 
thesis. That’s the way I like to think 
of it: not knowing, but using. 

Inconvenient? The greatest favor 
a friend can do for you is, every so 

THE STARS IN SHROUD 



often, to tilt the world at five de- 
grees. Everything dances, fresh- 
scrubbed. The universe becomes a 
fuller place because you must notice 
it. 

So for the rest of that day I went 
around in a distracted daze. Light 
appeared latticed, shifting abruptly 
through three shades as I watched. 
Hues blended. Veden became a 
chromatic chorus. 

Gharma came toward me, his 
smile flashing brilliantly against 
chestnut-brown skin pocked with 
the large pores of the Hindic. He 
was a heavy-set man with dark hair 
and eyes that expanded a fraction 
just before he spoke, as though the 
words were going to explode out of 
him. We exchanged pleasantries 
while, outside, fractured spatterings 
of yellow beckoned. He curled his 
words lazily, laying them out pre- 
cisely for the inspection of the lis- 
tener. 

Majumbdahr followed him, taller 
and with the slightly slanted eyes 
and lighter complexion that spoke 
of his mixed ancestry. “It’s after 
normal working hours,” he said, “I 
don’t think a tour of the Fleet Au- 
thority offices would be particularly 
useful for you today, sir.” 

“I presume you’ve gathered the 
usual summary for my review?” 

He smiled. “Certainly. But do 
you want to read them on your first 
evening on Veden? I imagined 
perhaps you would care to meet a 
few under-officers ...” 

“No. It was a tiring trip. I will 
probably want to sleep. Now, my 
offices?” 

We shot up seven floor.'- and 
emerged in an ornately styled war- 
ren of carpeted rooms walled with 

79 




imposing bookshelves in something 
like leather and wood, but with a 
raw orange cast that signified their 
native origin. My suite: chart rooms 
crammed with orbital simulation 
displays and readout screens, space 
for secretaries and aides, conference 
chambers (more leather, more 
wood), a private communications 
link that could override the Control 
facilities in an emergency, tape files 
and lastly my office, hushed in soft 
textures and tones, space for pacing 
or thought or meditation, an enor- 
mous desk — wood again — with 
every conceivable aid built into it. 
It overlooked the field. A forest be- 
yond underlined the wavering wink 
of Kalic’s city lights in the distance. 
Dusk was ending and blue shadow 
fingers cloaked the field. 

“The summary, sir,” Majumb- 
dahr said. 1 took the case with a 
large red PRIORITY seal on it and 
tucked it under my arm as we went 
out. 

“Your quarters are some dis- 
tance,” Gharma said. “I believe 
Mr. Majumbdahr has taken care of 
preparations there.” 

“Fine,” I said, my voice echoing 
in the elevator as we went down. “I 
would like to see both of you gen- 
tlemen tomorrow morning, nine 
hundred hours. We’ll have quite a 
bit to talk over.” 

Gharma said good night and 
Majumbdahr led me out the front 
entrance. It was a rather impres- 
sively delicate structure, curved lat- 
tices supported by columns and can- 
tilevered beams of rakish tilts that 
would have been impossible in 
heavier gravities. Everywhere 
curves; no angles, no sharpness or 
sudden contrast to jar the eye. A 

80 



man’s voice reflecting back from 
the building carried a tinkling note 
of hidden laughter. 

Majumbdahr pushed the car’s 
throttle forward and we pulled out 
silently. Steam cars fueled by low- 
grade hydrocarbons are common in 
the colonies; on Earth they are rare, 
owing to the depletion of our final 
reserves. 

Kalic: spires, cubes, towers, 

ovoids, hummocks of subsurface 
dwellings, an air of quiet and tran- 
quility impossible on Earth for cen- 
turies past. Our sedan turned onto 
country roads, into the velvet 
shadow of a hill. I knew the local 
flora from a stet I’d read on the 
loop out from the Flinger. As we 
passed, three snakeblossoms jerked 
up at the roadside, hissed — they 
were that loud — and puffed out their 
petals. Poison motes danced. 
Through the low, flowery brush, I 
could see beyond the blue winking 
of water. 

“A well-formed world,” I mur- 
mured. Veden’s equator and the 
plane of the ecliptic are aligned, 
giving mild climes here on the 
mesa. Just compensation, I thought, 
for the perpetual storms that raked 
the lowlands, where the air grew 
thick and acrid. 

“Your home has The Lapis at its 
doorstep,” Majumbdahr said. 
“Lekki rises directly across the lake 
most of the year.” 

Fleet had found it good policy to 
house their prime officers in the 
best residential districts of the 
Member Worlds. That established 
their social class and made for easy 
relations with civilians who ran 
local matters. 

I ordered Majumbdahr to stop the 
GALAXY 




car where we could overlook The 
Lapis. It was a solemn flat blue. A 
holy place, I knew, used for ritual 
bathings. I pointed to something 
gliding in far across the lake, catch- 
ing the last ruby glint of Lekkilight. 
I knew a slight change in gravity 
opened up new possibilities, but — 
“A bird?” I inquired, pointing. 

Majumbdahr squinted. “Not 
likely. In the lowlands, perhaps, 
such huge beasts would live. No, it 
must be a man with a featherwing.” 

The house was a faint blur high 
up the hill, its pale light filtered 
through slender fems. Mist 
gathered. We purred up the drive- 
way and stopped at the base of the 
ramp. Something fluttered low over 
our heads, busying the air, and lit 
in a fem. It warbled a high 
singsong call. Friends answered 
down by the lake, a sad note that 
drifted up through the gathering 
wetness of night. I breathed deeply, 
relaxing. So this was to be home. 

The house had a look of spun 
soft aluminum, of tile, of blackened 
enamel. Its roof floated high above 
visible support. Chunks of warm 
yellow light reached out to gather 
the forest around it like a blanket. 

We got out of the sedan and I 
strolled up the ramp, hands in 
pockets. More warbling calls. Then 
something came gliding, silent as a 
wisp of fog. 

A bark, a roar. 

Orange flame forked out of the 
sky. 

I turned. 

A dark winged form behind the 
stuttering flame. 

Something stung my face. I skit- 
tered to the side. 

A hail of fractured concrete 
82 



nipped at my heels, spattering into 
my eyes. 

The orange forking leaped near. I 
darted left, then right. Majumbdahr 
shouted something. I dove to the 
side. The ground split behind me. A 
flash — 

Then nothing. 

Silence again, but no bird calls. 
Moments went by on tiptoe, fingers 
to their lips. 

The winged man was gone An 
instant later I heard the mutter of 
his assist engine cutting in. In a few 
moments he would be klicks away, 
could go down anywhere in the 
forest and hide. 

My obedient glands shot a brew 
of adrenalin and sundry hormones 
through me, as Majumbdahr and I 
prowled the grounds. Nothing 
moved. The pocked rampway tes- 
tified to his firepower: twenty-four 
energy bolts, including the last blis- 
tering shot. 

“Somebody,” I said to 
Majumbdahr, my muscles singing 
with the adrenalin, “somebody here 
doesn’t like me.” 

“Sir, I have no explana- 
tion ...” 

“I don’t expect you to.” 

“It is most unusual.” 

“Maybe somebody’s prejudiced 
against Fleet Commandants these 
days.” 

“But Veden is a peaceful com- 
munity.” 

I stood, hands on hips, craning 
my neck at the sky that had so re- 
cently spat at me. “Think you can 
trace that flyer?’ ’ 

“No. There are many.” 
Majumbdahr sighed, exasperated. 
“The weapon, perhaps.” 

He got on the car comm, sent out 

GALAXY 




a bulletin. “Don’t let Security send 
a team out here!” I called out. 

“Why not, sir?” 

“I’ll take care of myself. They 
can patch up the ramp tomorrow.” 

“Sir, I think — ” 

“I repeat, I’ll look after my own 
safety.” If a staff gets the idea that 
their Commandant hides behind a 
phalanx of guards whenever matters 
get touchy, he will command their 
actions but not their respect. 

Majumbdahr nodded thoughtfully, 
mouth tightening. 

“Meanwhile, let’s go inside. Ap- 
parently the house is well insulated; 
whoever is inside seems to have 
heard nothing. Don’t mention this.” 

The fog was rolling in over it 
now, bringing body and flavor to 
the air. Creatures trilled airsongs 
again. 

The thick door was opened by a 
small brown man with a touch of 
gravity in his manner. Patil, the 
houseboy, I learned, an honored 
domestic of many years’ service. He 
was quiet and efficient and had us 
seated within a moment by an open 
fire (burning wood!), sweating 
drinks in our hands. He introduced 
Jamilla, a woman of indeterminant 
age and smooth skin with a look of 
playfulness about her: my second- 
rank domestic, cook and bed- 
chamber girl. Majumbdahr ex- 
plained that although Veden was in- 
frequently visited, the normal for- 
malities and liberties common to the 
Empire were the custom here too, 
and I should not have difficulty in 
adjusting. 

We walked onto a stone platform 
that jutted out from the house to 
clip the tops of trees that grew from 
below. I was still wearing my Spar- 

THE STARS IN SHROUD 



tan coverall that was standard gear 
with space suits. 

“Patil will dress you in the Fleet 
uniform appropriate to Veden on 
the morrow,” Majumbdahr said. He 
looked at me curiously, as if trying 
to understand this strange new Di- 
rector who demanded the official 
Summary in his first hour on the 
planet, and showed no interest in 
meeting other officers his first eve- 
ning, and shrugged off attempts on 
his life. Fine; let him. 

A small creature, something like 
a mouse with bat wings and furry 
topknot, coasted in through layers 
of fog and landed on my shoulders. 
I picked him up on a finger and saw 
his wings were translucent and cov- 
ered with fine pearly drops of mois- 
ture. 

“An air squirrel,” Majumbdahr 
said. “Scavengers, if you let them 
be. They’re really too friendly for 
their own good.” 

“There seems to be much flying 
life here.” I listened to the beat of 
wings above us and the faint high 
cries of pursuit. 

“Low gravity. We have not been 
harmful to most of the forms, so 
they do not resettle on other parts of 
Baslin.” 

“Why couldn’t they migrate to 
the lowlands and leave the plateau 
to men?” 

He smiled. “The same reason we 
do not live there. With both Lekki 
and the Black Dwarf nearby, Veden 
is subject to large tidal forces. The 
winds and heat of the lowlands are 
too variable and totally unpredic- 
table. Up here on the plateau we 
know the prevailing winds — always 
inward, from the sea. The flying 
animals do too. They couldn’t sur- 

83 




vive in two-hundred-kilometer gales 
any better than we.” 

He took the air squirrel from my 
finger, coaxed it with a crumb from 
his pocket and threw the bread up 
into the air. The animal leaped, 
caught it with a snap and coasted 
away on an updraft. I looked at 
Majumbdahr and decided I liked 
him. Which was well, for if I fol- 
lowed my plan, he would be one of 
the few Vedens I would know. 

We said our ritual farewells. I 
finished my inspection of my home, 
Patil and Jamilla following at a dis- 
creet distance and seeming pleased 
when I approved. I exchanged 
pleasantries with them, saw that my 
belongings from the shuttle were 
stored properly and had Patil lay out 
my bed clothes. 

A warm bath braced me. Shortly 
afterward I sprawled on my bed and 
cracked the seal on my case. 

I studied the Situation Report 
from Fleet Headquarters first. This 
was what I’d been waiting weeks 
and months to see. As a passenger 
on the Sasenbo, I’d heard rumors 
and gossip but no reliable hard in- 
formation about the war, but now as 
a Director and Commandant, no 
matter how low, I was entitled to 
know. 

Siganex IV had fallen. The same 
pattern as on Regeln; a tactical feint 
by the Quam, the Plague descend- 
ing, death and chaos. A 3D star 
chart showed the new boundaries of 
the Empire and probable points for 
the next Quam attack. It was a 
shock. The last such display I had 
seen was shortly after Regeln, and 
the pitiful collapsed ball I saw now 
was a fraction of the Empire then. 
Several isolated outposts had fallen 

84 



in the last few weeks, I noted, and 
the pinpoints of light which indi- 
cated Fleet’s dispersal of ships were 
asymmetric, obviously unable to 
coherently defend the contracting 
boundaries. 

I thumbed for a closeup on my 
flatpad display device and the re- 
gion around Lekki and the Black 
Dwarf leaped into focus. There 
were few neighbors. Fourteen lights 
out the red star Elaren blazed down 
on a small radio-fenite extracting 
mission. Beyond that were a few 
other temporary expeditions on in- 
hospitable worlds, there for limited 
economic purposes. The nearest full- 
status colony, larger even than Ve- 
den, was Gaining, in orbit around a 
massive gas giant of a planet that in 
turn circled a G3 star. None of 
these had detected Quam. The 
nearest contact was seventy-eight 
lights out, a very recent sighting 
only seven lights from the massive 
colony and base at Beta Hydri. The 
Quam appeared to be trying to 
pinch the Empire’s sphere into two 
irregular volumes of human- 
occupied space. But if past experi- 
ence was any help, this pattern was 
as much the product of the Quam’s 
irregular tactics and seemingly ran- 
dom strikes as anything else. 

That was the point: the fact that 
Veden was buried deep in the re- 
maining Empire volume was no in- 
surance that Quam would not ap- 
pear here tomorrow. This was an 
arbitrary war, not played according 
to the traditional game psychology 
of Fleet’s computers. As yet no one 
knew how or even why the Quam 
took a planet. Or what could stop 
them. 

So Veden wasn’t safe. I would 
GALAXY 




have to oversee the steady rain of 
transferring ships dropping out of 
Jump space, looping around the 
Dwarf and off to some new destina- 
tion with only a brief burst of news 
as greetings — oversee it all, keep 
the Jump ships and ancient 
ramscoops moving, while watching 
over my shoulder to see if the 
Quam had suddenly winked into ex- 
istence behind me. And Leibniz had 
once proposed that this was the best 
of all possible worlds. 

I picked up the Local Situation 
Report, then tossed it aside. 
G harm a and Majumbdahr could 
brief me on that tomorrow. I was 
hungry for more details about the 
Quarn, but the terse Fleet dispatch 
wasn’t giving anything away that it 
didn’t have to. 

Next came the Local Personnel 
file. I checked the names and posi- 
tions that interested me and the 
small piezoelectric monitor beamed 
a request back to the computer sit- 
ting under my offices. It squealed as 
the required information logged into 
its ferrite memory. I cradled the 
flatpad on my knees, flexed my 
back, which was becoming accus- 
tomed to significant gravities again, 
and started to read. 

Mahesh Majumbdahr, age forty- 
seven Earth years, height two meters 
(same as myself), hair black, eyes 
black, bom Earth (I raised my eye- 
brows at that) to Mainland parents of 
low stock; parents emigrated when 
he was five, settled on Veden. At- 
tended usual series: primary techni- 
cal, sensitivity and arts, showed 
proficiency in athletics and played 
odeynsn professionally for four 
years, enjoyed some fame as a writer 
of haiku, joined Fleet at age twenty- 



five. Security cleared maximum for 
Lekki system. Married on long-term 
contract, terminated two years ago 
with mutual consent. 

There was much more relating to 
his professional career, and I ab- 
sorbed it automatically. But what I 
was after was more than the raw 
facts of the man: I needed to know 
what bias he had, how well he 
could work on a closely personal 
basis. Most of that can only be 
judged by intuition. 

Lapanthul Gharma, age fifty-two 
Earth years, one-ninety centimeters, 
hair brown, eyes green, descendant 
of three generations native to Ve- 
den, considered high caste (this last 
a recent entry; perhaps caste was 
only lately added as relevant data?) 
and of high standing in local sect 
(unnamed). Parents both of notable 
rank; father recently retired from 
political circles to devote his time to 
meditation and enlightenment (insert 
note: mmored he was forced out in 
power play by agricultural inter- 
ests). Entered Fleet service at age 
twenty-one and declared for com- 
mission two years later. No known 
other interests. Same security clear- 
ance. Married permanently. (In- 
teresting. Quite rare:) 

I went down the list of other staff 
members, some of them unusual, 
others dull as dirt. Strange what 
personnel will think relevant and 
stick in a man’s file. I read several 
accounts of illicit affairs and Result- 
ant difficulties, none of them bear- 
ing even slightly on Fleet business 
or security reliability but quite 
juicy, then chucked it aside. No 
time for gossip. (Not much, any- 
way.) 

With surprise I felt a touch of 

85 



THE STARS IN SHROUD 




hunger. I sounded a chime over my 
bed and Jamilla came in with low- 
ered eyes, took my request for fruit 
and padded quietly out. 

I leaned back and thought about 
my two executive officers. Gharma 
seemed more steady, but less fond 
of the spark of a new idea. 
Majumbdahr might make a better 
friend, if that was what I was after. 

And maybe I was. I had decided 
on the Sasenbo to save my time on 
Veden, not become tangled in the 
thousand loose ends of a military 
command. There was only one way 
to do that: find a core of men you 
can trust and let them make a lot of 
the decisions. Gharma and 
Majumbdahr were going to be the 
core. It had to be more than the 
usual delegation of authority — every 
officer knows to release some of his 
hold or he’ll end up ordering his 
own paper clips — and I would have 
to play it by ear. 

I needed time. Let Fleet 
agonize; not for me the plugging 
of holes in a crumbling dike. There 
was no joy left for me in the warm 
knit of Sabal. The Quam had cut 
those cords. 

Veden had never used the Sabal 
Game. It was the spiritual center of 
the Hindic minority, a small frag- 
ment of the Empire brave enough to 
colonize this planet when it was the 
most dangerous of all the known 
worlds. That was before the Flinger 
was conceived, before anyone knew 
this system could be so vastly use- 
ful. Once the Flinger was begun, 
Veden still successfully resisted the 
Mongul culture. Perhaps, all told, 
this was the best place for me now. 

I was a commander again, but 
without the spiritual matrix Sabal 

86 



had given me. Adrift. Maybe there 
was something on Veden for me. In 
the guttering ruin of the Empire, 
Veden might flicker as the only re- 
maining light. Here, at least, I 
could savor life again, and ponder. 
Earth had gone stale for me long 
ago. 

The Hindic and the Quam. Un- 
knowns, all. Veden was at least 
human. The Quam held all the mys- 
tery of the unknown. 

Jamilla entered with a bowl of 
cylindrical fruit and a snifter of red 
liquid. The fruit was tough at first 
but after a moment’s chewing re- 
leased juices with the flavor of 
warm almonds. The drink was a 
clashing — a tang of oranges, with a 
smooth background like apricot nec- 
tar. Somehow they resolved each 
other and quenched my thirst. 

I caught Jamilla studying me with 
interest. No more than a fraction of 
the people here were Mongul in de- 
scent, and certainly she had seen 
few Polynesians such as me. I sup- 
posed my lighter hair and thin beard 
(a gene of the Caucasoids, that) 
were unusual, but . 

Normal formalities and liberties, 
Majumbdahr had said. I raised an 
eyebrow in speculation. It had been 
a long time. 

I finished eating, put the tray 
aside and made a formal sign un- 
derstood throughout the Empire. 

Jamilla smiled and unfastened the 
brass buckle at her side. Her sansari 
was a wisp of cloth wound into ex- 
pert folds over her slim body. 
Watching her gracefully remove it 
was an entertainment. She came 
into bed with the good taste not to 
extinguish the lights. She was a 
scent as sweet as the wind. 



GALAXY 




* ★ * 

In the night I rose, heart tripping, 
the winged man filling mind’s eye, 
and the thought raced: Who was he? 
A Fleet-hater? Religious fanatic? A 
man hoping that a better universe 
could come out of the muzzle of a 
gun? What a sad old idea. 

I opened click the garden portal 
and sucked in frosted night breeze. 
I felt like calling out into the muted 
darkness, You wouldn’t have killed 
Fleet, you know. It goes on. 

It goes on. On and on, until dis- 
order eats even the Empire. The 
Quam were on the side of entropy, 
the final winner in all this mad 
scramble. 

Entropy. The amber dimming of 
all suns, the blunting of all momen- 
tum. 

And neither you nor I, my 
enemy, can do anything about that.

In the morning Patil aided me in 
fitting my Fleet Kochu robes. They 
shielded the wearer from Lekki’s ul- 
traviolet and were robes only by 
convention, for they retained pants 
and vest. The only addition was a 
cowl that rode on the back of my 
neck and could be slipped over to 
shade my face. 

My contact filters flushed the 
morning with an orange tinge even 
though Lekki’s violet dot threw 
shattered dancing light up to me 
from Lapis. The water traced a pen- 
cil line of horizon across two thirds 
of the view. I could see the current 
ripples as the triple tides of Lekki, 
the Dwarf and Pincter, Veden’s 
moon, pulled at the lake. The beach 

THE STARS IN SHROUD 



a hundred meters below was a 
broad white plain .worn smooth by 
the hissing waves. 

All this I saw while blinking the 
contacts into place and walking 
down the cratered ramp to my staff 
car. The driver saluted and with a 
slight piping of steam, we went 
down into the world of men. 

I wasted an hour in the unavoid- 
able preliminaries in my new of- 
fices; nodding at secretaries, exchang- 
ing ritual salutes with second- and 
third-rank administrators, accepting 
a traditional welcoming gift of bur- 
nished rice and layered spices (take 
one mouthful, then offer it to the 
troops). Then to the main confer- 
ence room, filled with twenty staff 
workers. Their eyes widened 
slightly as I ignored convention and 
sent them all on detailed, eminently 
defensible tail-chasing jobs that 
would take days or weeks to com- 
plete. 

Correlate fluctuations in rice crop 
and number of ships passing 
through the Flinger; compile com- 
posite history of all minority 
economic alternatives used on 
Veden which had applicability to 
Empire economy; detail origin of 
more recent sects (this 1 could actu- 
ally use); each division prepare re- 
ports, sharpen up training schedule, 
stipulate defense capability, justify 
all current supply levels. The orders 
were a compendium of jargon and 
catch phrases, but it accomplished 
the result: keep them busy, get them 
out of the room. Only Majumbdahr 
and Gharma remained. 

“Now tell me about Veden. 
What are the people thinking?” 

“Not very much thinking is being 
done,” said Majumbdahr slowly. 



87 




“There’s a great deal of reacting, 
though.” 

“How do you mean?” 

“They’re confused. The reports 
from the colonies further out 
haven’t been precisely encourag- 
ing.” 

“Are you sure this isn’t simply 
what you’ve been hearing from the 
population of Kalic alone? On Earth 
the city populations are breaking 
down much faster than the rural 
areas.” 

“Even on Veden, sir,” Gharma 
broke in, “there are not substantial 
numbers living among the jungles. 
They are not a significant group.” 
“Why aren’t they spread out?” 
“You haven’t seen Kalic yet,” 
Majumbdahr said. “Veden isn’t like 
the other colony worlds — the Mon- 
gul cluster-home isn’t popular 
here.” 

Gharma gestured with his hands 
as if a flower were unfolding. “Our 
cities are as pods on a quasimakas 
plant, spaced to insure adequate 
sunlight and full growth. The open- 
ness of the growthlands is always 
with us. To live otherwise is ... ” 
He stopped awkwardly, realizing 
that he had almost implied a criti- 
cism of the Mongul aesthetics, to 
which presumably I subscribed. 

I gave him a smile. “I quite un- 
derstand. The same principles once 
held even on Earth. Necessities of 
population change these things.” I 
turned to Majumbdahr. “I take it 
you feel even the citizens of Kalic 
and the other outlying cities are not 
truly in what the Empire would re- 
gard as an urban environment?” 
“Yes, as far as I understand 
Fleet’s analysis.” 

“I think it is certainly true, sir,” 

88 



Gharma said. “Veden is much 
more stable because of it.” 

Majumbdahr looked at him a lit- 
tle sourly. “I wonder about that.” 

I glanced a question. 

“Well, sir,” he said quickly, 
bringing his hands together on the 
opaque gray of the conference table, 
“I don’t like the feeling that’s run- 
ning through Kalic. I wasn’t bom 
here, but I think I have a good 
grasp of the gestalt. People are 
seething inside. It hasn’t come out 
yet, but it will.” 

Gharma shook his head. “As you 
may see, sir, we have talked of this 
before.” 

“Natural enough. In the absence 
of a Director you were responsible 
for knowledge of the political side. 
It’s an open secret that Fleet is now 
relying more on its reports from Di- 
rectors than the official opinion 
given by the Embassies.” 

Gharma blinked rapidly. “Oh, no, 
I’m afraid you do not understand. 
This is not a political matter at all. 
We are speaking here of the tran- 
quility and enlightenment of the 
people.” 

I nodded, silently pleased. They 
were both showing a sensitivity that 
might easily have been drilled out 
of them by now, in Fleet. I couldn’t 
use men who thought like political 
hacks, glutted with detail and trivia, 
afflicted with a ward heeler’s smug 
myopia. 

“Of course,” Majumbdahr waved 
the comment away with rough 
hands too large for the rest of his 
body. “But sit in the temples, 
Lapanthul” — side glance to me — 
“Mr. Gharma. They’re stirring. 
Their meditation is not enough.” 

“Is that true, Lapanthul?” I said. 

GALAXY 




“I do not feel that it is — and that 
is the final test. But I am not quite 
as, ah, basic as Mahesh. I do not 
move in quite the same spheres as 
he.” 

Majumbdahr settled back in his 
formed plastic chair. “What he 
means is that his sect is very high 
in caste, and mine lies somewhere 
in the middle.” He grinned. “It 
gives one a different slant, I’d 
imagine.” 

“Caste? I’d thought ...” 

Gharma cleared his throat. “Yes, 
it does exist on Veden. We all 
know the Empire has no such thing, 
but I have heard that we are not 
alone — other colonies, and not Hin- 
dic in origin, have caste, or some- 
thing like it.” He said this with the 
somewhat stiff and defiant air of a 
man confessing a minor but habitual 
vice. 

“But caste. The term ...” 

“Historically it was an evil 
thing,” Majumbdahr said. “The 
choice of word is unfortunate. I’ve 
always held it should be something 
like ‘station.’ ” With this he 
glanced up at Gharma. “But the so- 
cial conventions favored the tradi- 
tional term. It does not have the 
same connotation as in Old India.” 

Gharma smiled brilliantly. “He 
means to say, not yet. Mahesh 
thinks we’re headed that way, 
nonetheless.” 

I realized that they were good 
friends, despite their differences. 
There was a warmth in their argu- 
ment, as though it were an old shoe 
they felt comfortable wearing. 

“All right, so there’s caste,” I 
said, sighing slightly. There was 
something about this conversation, a 
sort of agonizing slowness to con- 

THE STARS IN SHROUD 



verge on the point, that may have 
been just the Hindic way of doing 
things. I was going to have to get 
used to a more indirect approach. 
“It would seem that by traditional 
sociological principles, that would 
make Vedens more secure, happier 
with their place. But that’s no help. 
People throughout the Empire were 
contented, they hadn’t lost phase. 
But I’ve seen all of them struck 
down by the Plague. They had no 
defense.” 

Gharma looked suddenly sadder. 
“We know that. I don’t understand 
how it could happen, when — ” 

“Have you had any cases here 
yet?” 

Both of them looked slightly star- 
tled, as though the thought hadn’t 
occurred to them that Veden was 
vulnerable. “Nothing has been 
reported — ” Gharma started. 

“Do you know how to recognize 
the symptoms? Has Fleet sent 
through instructional information, 
case histories?” 

“Yes, a little. I have read it my- 
self. It is difficult to believe.” 
Gharma shook his head slowly, as 
if realizing for the first time that the 
Plague was real and not just the 
abstract subject of a series of dis- 
patches. 

“Break out all the material you 
have on the Plague,” I said. “Form 
up classes from personnel not on 
essential duty. Get space in the civil- 
ian press for full coverage: how to 
spot the symptoms, first signs that 
you may be getting it yourself, 
treatment, history, the works. 
You’ve delayed on this too long. 
We’ve got to be prepared.” I 
banged my fist on the table. 

Gharma got up and went over to a 

89 




wall communicator, spoke into it in 
a whisper and returned. “Done,” 
he said softly. 

How could they have let it go? It 
was one thing to be bottled up on 
this outpost, watching the ships 
flash through the Flinger but seldom 
having one land — and quite another 
to forget about defending the planet. 

“1 take it these measures are of 
some use against the Plague?” 
Majumbdahr asked. 

“Perhaps, perhaps,” I said, dis- 
tracted. Did they know how much 
I’d been through? Forget it; no time 
to worry. “They seem to slow it 
down and sometimes keep the 
people alive. That’s all we know, 
but it’s enough.” 

“I think the people probably 
know more than you’d think, 
Lapanthul,” Majumbdahr said. 
“There have been numerous news 
services’ reports, 3D programs. Not 
much, to be sure — ” He glanced at 
me to show that he knew as well as 
anyone about Fleet censorship. 
“ — but I think they may be pre- 
pared for the Plague, when it 
comes. Giving them the complete 
facts will make it easier — fear 
comes from the unknown, not the 
known. That’s why they’re in the 
streets — fear.” 

“The streets?” I asked. 

“Civil disturbances,” Gharma 
said earnestly. “A few, and quickly 
contained.” 

“What about?” 

“Fleet movements aren’t well- 
kept secrets,” Majumbdahr said. 
“A lot of civilians work in Com- 
munications, so they know there 
isn’t a respectable Task Force near 
this system. If the Quam come, 
we’ll stand alone.” 

90 



Gharma nodded. “I don’t think 
they realize quite that they are 
afraid. The violence is so 
undirected — ” 

“Reporting, sir!” It was an offi- 
cial Fleet secretary I’d sent on a 
make work assignment an hour ago. 
“Fleet vessel L. S. Caton has 
passed formal recognition proce- 
dures after emerging from Jump 
space and requests final orbital 
check for her Flinger orbit.” 

A mass of jargon; it meant I had 
to give my final meaningless ap- 
proval of an orbit already pro- 
grammed for the ship. The L.S. 
Caton had been locked into the 
course several days ago, but the an- 
cient formalities of the Port Master 
had to be observed. 

“Granted.” I really didn’t give a 
damn about the empty motions of 
Fleet business any longer. I wanted 
to see Veden, to meet the myriad 
sounds and smells of a new world, 
where there were still real problems 
to solve, not sit in this office. 

“Mr. Majumbdahr! Do you think 
you could find a suitable restaurant 
in Kalic for lunch?”

Everywhere there was color. 
Magenta fronds, tangled snake vines 
of a chilled deep green, the imper- 
sonal dull tan of the roadway — and 
all crowned by a clear sky of even 
blue. The colors reminded me of 
my contact filters and I blinked 
rapidly a few times. They were oc- 
casionally uncomfortable. 

We crossed the large bustling 
square in the noonday rush. Click- 
ing of a hundred sandals. Murmur 
of conversations as knots of friends 

GALAXY 




drifted past. No matter how far hu- 
mans might fly in their machines, 
these things held constant. 

Cramped shops displayed their 
wares with abandon, letting robes 
and bolts of cloth spill in gaudy ex- 
cess from their boxes. Beads and 
ancient books shared display cases; 
fruits and spices competed for the 
same spot in a window. There was 
a cheerful easiness about it, and the 
people were the same: talking, 
laughing, greeting the price of items 
with a feigned sharp bark of disbe- 
lief. 

We cut across the square with 
Lekki straight overhead, burning a 
hole in heaven. A few men and 
women clad in raiments were speak- 
ing to the passersby of their mission 
in life, advising them of the benefits 
that accrued to anyone of their cho- 
sen faith. But not pushing it, not 
with the intense drive of the cultists 
I had seen on Earth. There was a 
relaxed air here. Fine, I thought. 
But / am beyond that old snake oil 
now. 

Five of the women in a circle 
chanted — 

I am 

Not great or small 

But only 

Part of All. 

We turned into a narrow street, 
almost an alley, that was the exact 
opposite of the clean, broad streets 
I’d seen. Here the even sheet of 
plastiform street changed into a 
bumpy track of winding black 
cobblestone. Some shops huddled 
together, and others sprawled; all 
were busy with people buying and 
selling, bartering in high-pitched 

THE STARS IN SHROUD 



tones, inspecting the goods, eyeing 
the shopkeeper. It was like a page 
of history. I recognized emblems 
and signets of Old India, some even 
dating from before the Riot War. 

“This is part of the ‘recon- 
structed’ district,” Majumbdahr 
said, “devoted to retaining the at- 
mosphere of the Hindic past. Much 
of it is honest and true to the orig- 
inal. Those rice bins” — he gestured 
at an enormous tub with an inde- 
cipherable scrawl in red on the 
side — “contain pure strains a 
gourmet would have recognized 
even in Old India. They’re kept in 
controlled environments so the 
Veden ecology doesn’t alter them 
even slightly.” 

“All this to retain the old 
ways?” 

“The flavor of the past. These 
things, these crafts and 
methods” — he motioned about 
us — “were part of the Rebirth of 
the Hindic people after the Riot 
War. It is well to keep them. They 
might be useful even again.” 

I looked at him curiously, won- 
dering if he was thinking of the 
Quam. 

We passed through streets that 
seemed to reek of ancient ways and 
thoughts. I paused occasionally to 
watch a grinder or a spin-drifter at 
work, saw an elementary syncon 
computer being used to operate a 
foundry that produced images of 
Fanakana, a winged dragon-dog of 
early (and now dead) mythology, 
walked among carved erotic statues 
ten meters high, sniffed the grainy 
texture of air filled with the sweat 
of work and reek of spices. 

It was a bit unconventional for 
Majumbdahr to bring me here. Usu- 

91 




ally a Fleet underofficer would take 
his superior to a more formal and 
military luncheon, to demonstrate 
his seriousness. But then, 
Majumbdahr was an unconventional 
officer. 

I remembered one of the inci- 
dents related in his file. Some years 
ago, in a lesser post, Majumbdahr 
had dined alone in the Kalic 
officers’ mess. The room was busy 
and waiters did not notice him, seat- 
ed in a far corner. He became im- 
patient. But instead of stalking out, 
Majumbdahr went to a phone booth 
and called a restaurant that deliv- 
ered meals. He asked them to 
bring a spiced dahlma to the 
officers’ mess. When it arrived, he 
made no great show of eating, but a 
few officers noticed and the story 
spread. The Commandant heard of 
it and investigated the standards of 
service in the mess. Soon matters 
improved. And through it all 
Majumbdahr had said nothing, 
never raised his voice in criticism. 
It was an effective technique. 

We reached a small squat restau- 
rant and found our way inside 
through near-total darkness, sweep- 
ing by bead curtains under the guid- 
ance of a wrinkled old headwaiter. 

“It is very fine,” I said after we 
were seated. “I have seen nothing 
to equal this district anywhere in the 
Empire.” 

Majumbdahr smiled depreca- 
tingly. “Really? But these things are 
necessary — cultural drifts occur 
without them. How is it done on 
Earth?” 

“By symbols, mostly,” I said, 
trying to phrase my answer cor- 
rectly. “We — or rather, they — focus 
on the part rather than the whole.

Instead of a statue, a stone. A forest 
becomes a plate of wood. And there 
is the Sabal Game, of course.” 

He nodded. “The Game is played 
here, as well, but only by a few. 
We do not find it particularly rele- 
vant to our needs.” 

The waitress brought a steaming 
plate of rolled breads like 
papadams, meat-soaked sauce in- 
side. “What replaces it?” I asked. 

“A number of things, perhaps 
none of them as impressive as the 
Game. This district, for one. The 
isolation we have from the rest of 
the Empire helps, too — few cross- 
cultural influences manage to get 
here, and when they do, they’re 
sometimes so extraneous as to have 
rfo effect. And of course the tradi- 
tion of the Savant, the Saint, the 
Guru.” 

I finished the breads — which had 
turned out to be a sort of woven 
rice cake instead — and paused. 
“This meat? It is — ” 

“Of course,” Majumbdahr 
shrugged. “Organic products.” 

“I’ve heard of colony planets on 
which — ” 

“Not here. No lower forms are 
slaughtered.” 

I smiled and continued eating a 
side dish of marinated vegetables 
placed at my elbow. The alternative 
to the organic tanks — once it was 
agreed that animals, being spiritu- 
ally of the same Order, could not be 
harmed — was vegetarianism, a sin- 
gularly difficult and unhealthy path. 

“Savants, you said?” I con- 
tinued. “We had few of those on 
Earth or the colonies I visited.” 

“I don’t believe the practice is 
part of the Mongul heritage. In the 
dead religion of Confucianism it 

GALAXY 




had a place, I’m told, but the Riot 
War ended that.” 

‘‘Some hold it died in the First 
Republic that was formed on the 
mainland just before the War.” 

Majumbdahr bit his lip. 
‘‘Perhaps, but it doesn’t matte.r.” 
He didn’t want to get involved in 
the intricacies of Empire political 
history, particularly since they 
might still touch on the present. 
“The old ways of Zen, when they 
reached the inlands after the War, 
fairly well destroyed the appointed 
station of the Guru. One doesn’t 
need a guide to find what is all 
around him and yet within him- 
self. ’ ’ 

“I would not put it quite that 
way,” I said, laughing gently. I 
remembered my first instruction, the 
koan I had wrestled with for seem- 
ing ages when I was a boy. It was a 
classic ambiguity, simple and full of 
depth for meditation. Its eleventh- 
'century name (Christian reckoning) 
was the “Three Barriers of Hung- 
Lun.” 

Question: Everybody has a place 
of birth. Where is your place 
of birth? 

Answer: Early this morning I ate 
white rice gruel. Now I’m hun- 
gry again. 

Question: How is my hand like the 
Buddha’s hand? 

Answer: Playing the lute under the 
moon. 

Question: How is my foot like a 
donkey’s foot? 

Answer: When the white heron 
stands in the snow, it has a dif- 
ferent color. 

The first answer? It indicates that 



facts of birth and death are snow 
flakes in the great wind of time, as 
trivial as the eternal cycle of hunger 
and satiety. The second: let loose 
your constant reasoning, sing to the 
moon and be the Buddha. Be here. 
And the third? I do not think I can 
express it, even now, in words. 

That was the first stage, zazen, 
individual perceptions of the Essen- 
tial. After that came social aware- 
ness, the gestalt, Sabal. But after 
that, what? 

* * * 

Once I crashed on a frozen 
world. As a young Fleet officer I’d 
been delegated to make a short run 
to a way station there. I blew a 
wing coming in. I snapped a 
forearm and quickfroze it, but I 
couldn’t chill down the three 
crushed ribs. My comm failed high 
up, so there was no trace on me. I 
had to walk out. Through ice fields 
glimmering blue and white, through 
rock and snow. 

There were human renegades 
there, descendants of criminals 
who’d washed up in that solar sys- 
tem five hundred years before. They 
had quaint practices. They thought 
travelers were stalking horses sent 
by God, for the virtuous to take out 
their anger on. First they’d hunt 
you, then they’d run you for a 
while in the open, then they’d cut a 
few tendons and run you some 
more. It would take you a week or 
more to die. 

I shot three of them but a fourth 
slashed my side with a bone knife. 
Five others started running me, let- 
ting me get just enough ahead to 
think maybe I was breaking into the

clear. That went on for three days. 
By that time my rations were gone 
and my right leg, where a spear had 
ripped the insulation, was going 
dead on me. 

I worked my way through a nar- 
row pass in the ice. My last person- 
nel charges had timers; I set them 
and blew quite a few tons of ice 
into the pass. That gave me time, 
but by then I couldn’t use it. I 
walked a while. Then I crawled. I 
passed out. 

When I woke up, a product of my 
delirium was shuffling at my shoul- 
der. It was thirty meters across. 
Skin like crinkled tar, a huge cone 
at the top, gnarled jegs at the bot- 
tom. It put a feeler'in my mouth; I 
couldn’t stop it. The feeler turned 
out to be a tube. Something warm 
and sticky and maybe sweet came 
through it. I drank the warm what- 
ever and peered at the cone, which 
was slowly tilting around toward 
me, and went to sleep. 

When I woke up, it was gone. No 
tracks in the snow, nothing. I lay 
there for a day and prepared to die. 
My lead on the hunters was now a 
day, maybe two. 

In the long night my delirium 
came again. Perhaps the cone crea- 
ture visited me, with its shambling, 
achingly slow walk and sticky 
brown tube. Perhaps the wind made 
me hear voices. I went into a place 
where there was a stilled center. It 
was a space different from the sure- 
ness I knew in the Sabal Game, a 
territory where I skated, skated over 
a sheen: the ice that films the uni- 
verse. I sensed it as Other. The ful- 
crum of my salvation. 

In the morning I woke and 
walked. I reached a power nexus 

94 



the next day. A skimmer came for 
me. 

Seven years later on a convoy 
flight I chanced on a scientific re- 
port from that world. They had 
found a huge Iifeform, one that 
communicated by radio. Its princi- 
pal sensory organ was an immense 
radio antenna, evolved for some un- 
imaginable communications. It 
clearly sensed the stars, and some 
small prey — but what else? At- 
tempts to make contact seemed 
fruitless. 

So the cone creature was not 
from my delirium. Was the sense of 
Other also real? 

An ancient philosopher once ob- 
served that when a man saturates 
himself with alcohol and sees purple 
snakes, we laugh. When a man 
fasts and sees God, we listen. 
Should I laugh, or listen? 

★ ★ ★ 

We had finished the coriander- 
laced curry and the world had taken 
on a deep, salty tang. I had been si- 
lent in the lazy warmth of the meal, 
but then Majumbdahr said intently, 
“You were correct about the prep- 
arations, sir.” 

“How so?” I focused on busi- 
ness again. 

“We erred.” 

“By not briefing staff and impor- 
tant locals, setting plans for Slots, 
and so on?” 

“Yes, that. We had no one of 
your experience. Here news of Fleet 
seems so distant.” 

“My experience?” 

“Well, yes.” 

“What experience?” 

“You . contracted the illness 

GALAXY 




yourself, sir. I believe?” 

“So?” 

‘‘Not many recover, it is said.” 
“So it is said. I wouldn’t know.” 
“Still, sir, it is an unusual ac- 
complishment ...” 

I cracked a wry smile. “My un- 
conscious did all the work.” 

“We believe in fate here, sir.” 
“Look,” I began, indulging my 
taste for contradictions,” being 
superstitious is bad luck in itself. 
Don’t — what’s that?” 

A low rumbling cry from outside, 
the sound of many voices. 

“It might be some Lancers, sir. 
They are a new sect. We have been 
urging local authorities to keep 
them under control, but — ” 

Impatient at the growing babble 
outside, I got up and threaded my 
way through the topple tables of the 
restaurant. 

Majumbdahr called, “Sir, that 
man will — ” At which point he did. 
He turned to huiTy away from the 
entrance and slammed into me, al- 
most knocking me over. The man 
blundered on without a glance. 

I went to the entrance. The crowd 
was backed up flush with the old 
worn shops, facing toward the nar- 
row street, packed in tightly. I 
couldn’t see a thing. Some faces 
were tense, others unconcerned. 
Obviously the running man had 
sensed something he feared. The 
chanting came nearer. It was almost 
covered by the babble of conversa- 
tion from the pedestrians, obviously 
expecting a show. 

Majumbdahr materialized beside 
me. “Help me break through,” I 
yelled. 

Together we pushed against the 
wall of backs keeping us from the 
96 



street, shoving together until some- 
thing gave. I jostled forward 
through the bodies, ignoring scowls 
and snarls. In a moment I was near 
the front. 

The Lancers had just gotten to 
this point and were streaming by, 
shouting something about Veden 
and rights, waving tapestries on 
bamboo poles, stamping and hoot- 
ing and jamming the onlookers back 
from the center of the path. The 
crowd didn’t seem to be worried or 
afraid; they treated it as a lark, an 
entertainment. It seemed to me a lot 
of noise for nothing — it was impos- 
sible to tell what they were shouting 
about. 

Then I heard a slight scream from 
further back in the Lancer column. 
A sharp cry of pain, a bark of out- 
rage. Then another. People around 
me stirred. The barrage of sound 
from the Lancers increased in vol- 
ume but now I could hear the 
screams clearly over the chant. 

Majumbdahr caught my eye and 
gestured toward the cries, which 
seemed to be getting closer. I nod- 
ded, asked a question with my 
eyebrows. He shrugged. Evidently 
this latest touch was new to him 
too. 

And to the crowd as well. They 
pushed back toward the shops, try- 
ing to get away from the center of 
the street. In a moment I stood 
alone. Men and women struggled, 
pressing into the already crowded 
shops. 

The Lancers came on. The chant 
faded. Standing there, even in my 
coverall uniform and cowl, I felt 
exposed as I waited for whatever 
was coming around the next comer. 
But an officer does not run. 



GALAXY 




The end of the Lancer column 
broke around the comer of a shop 
further down the alley. Young men 
in loincloths, perhaps a dozen, car- 
rying short, stubby clubs. They 
lashed out at the crowd cowering in 
doorways. 

Majumbdahr stood at my right. 
One of them laughed, struck a man 
in the side, hurled an oath at him 
and passed on. The Lancers in col- 
umn were smiling too. A lark. A 
holiday afternoon, for them. 

They saw us. Three broke out of 
file and converged on us, rocking 
the clubs loosely in their hands, 
casual. 

I went back into rest position, left 
forearm out, right leg cocked back 
and keeping balance over my body 
center. Right arm tucked into side. 
Training school memories. Watch 
their faces, focus forward, eyes 
front but seeing everything to the 
sides. 

The first one swung a club down 
with his right. I blocked with my 
forearm, dropping further back. He 
went slightly off balance. I raised 
my right knee, shot out a chopping 
foreleg kick. It caught him in the 
stomach. I dropped back to balance. 

The kick wasn’t strong enough. 
Getting old. He came forward 
again, this time favoring his right 
side where the kick had landed. 
Side chop with the club, very fast. I‘ 
stepped back again, watching him 
move. The man had a sour, panicky 
smell. No opening worth the 
chance. 

The third man stood aside, watch- 
ing. 

Majumbdahr was moving in the 
comer of my eye, try to wrestle his 
man to the ground. Mine came at 

THE STARS IN SHROUD 



me again. This time he rushed mat- 
ters a bit. His right foot came down 
too early for the overhead blow 
he’d planned. 

I stepped forward, chopped his 
arm. I shot my left elbow into his 
face as he stumbled past me. He 
smacked hard on the obsidian 
cobblestones. He shook his head, 
too dazed to get up. 

The third man cursed us and ran, 
hooting wildly. Majumbdahr had his 
pinned to the ground. I felt a little 
silly, a senior officer fighting in the 
streets. Were the civilians eyeing 
me curiously? 

“Send for the police!” I shouted 
at one of them. Then I noticed the 
crumpled form further down the 
street. 

It was a girl, unconscious. Her 
black hair fanned out in a crescent 
around her head and there was an 
ugly .red patch on her scalp. I cra- 
dled her head to see if there were 
any other wounds. Someone came 
over and volunteered that the Lan- 
cers hadn’t struck her; she must 
have fallen in the rush. 

Police whined over in a helicop- 
ter and dropped into the street on 
ladders; evidently ground transport 
through the reconstructed district 
was too slow. I held the girl’s head 
and ignored the two Lancers who 
were led away. She was injured in a 
stupid, pointless demonstration — if 
that was the right name — and I felt 
responsible. If I’d pressed Gharma 
about civil disturbances, I might’ve 
been working on the problem in- 
stead of sight-seeing in town. And 
this was just the sort of thing that 
reeked, disquietingly, of the Quam. 

It had the feel of strangeness, of 
people going off their precarious 



97 




balance. The Hindic peoples were 
always pacifists. We even had trou- 
ble recruiting Fleet base personnel 
on Veden. A group like the Lancers 
was totally at variance with the 
traditions here. Yet they were here, 
and the crowds had smiled, perhaps 
even identified with them. Why? 
Did the Lancers express something 
they all wanted to say, but 
couldn’t? 

Someone was tapping me on the 
shoulder. I looked up into 
Majumbdahr’s face and at once re- 
alized that 1 didn’t want to let her 

go- 

“Medical is here, sir,” he said. 
“They’ll be wanting ...” 

“Tell them . tell them to treat 
her and deliver her to my personal 
home,” I said without thinking. “I 
want to talk to her.” I looked down 
and saw her for the first time. Black 
hair, delicate features. She smiled 
weakly at me. 

I watched the ambulance pull 
away with her and recognized dimly 
that I was slowly coming out of the 
slight autohypnosis I’d given myself 
just before the fight. Training was 
reasserting itself. Majumbdahr 
finished talking to the head of the 
police squad and glanced at me. 

“Come,” I called, waving. 
“Let’s lift.”

Momentum is as momentum 
does. Thus, Fleet schedules wait for 
no man, even a puffing Comman- 
dant years beyond his martial aits 
drills. L. S. Caton was passing 
through the Flinger. I wanted to 
watch, to sense the flex and flow of 
my command. 

98 



Local police reported to me on 
the copter journey back: some Lan- 
cers detained, but they had no 
plausible explanation of why their 
ritual display eroded into brutality. I 
sent a priority demand for a sum- 
mary of all such past incidents. 

Veden Fleet Control wasn’t all 
that impressive. Most of the Fling- 
er’ s detection grid was in close orbit 
around Lekki-Jagen, where things 
became gaudy. Computers are the 
same faceless ferrite walls ev- 
erywhere in the Empire. The large 
cavem of display screens, verbal 
inputs/outputs, primary and backup 
consoles, low-glare phosphors glow- 
ing a sullen red, clacking of tracer 
prints, mutter of conversations es- 
caping from muffling mikes— the 
cavem was forgettable. Except for 
the display screen. 

On the screen Lekki blazed eter- 
nal, whipped by Jagen’s knotted fist 
of gravity. I watched a tiny glint of 
light that was the L. S. Caton creep 
across Lekki’ s blue snarling face, 
boosting faster than light. It arced 
around Jagen’s black dot in a de- 
formed parabola and raced away, a 
graceful and intricate dance of the 
spheres. Destination: Abbe IV, a 
fertile planet circling a G4 star over 
a hundred parsecs away. 

The stars are fixed and eternal 
only for times slightly longer than a 
man’s life. In reality those 
diamond-bright flecks are roaring 
through the galaxy, a mad swarm of 
bees. The galaxy itself has spun 
around twenty times since its birth, 
scrambling stars like seeds before 
the wind. Between Abbe IV and 
Earth — the L. S. Caton’ s home 
port — was a 154.6 km/sec velocity 
difference. It wasn’t enough to wink 

GALAXY 




into Jump space and out again — 
somebody had to fork up the dif- 
ference in kinetic energies (relative 
to galactic center) between the two. 
That means fuel, and time. Far 
cheaper, then, for the L. S. Caton 
to detour quickly through Jump 
space to Lekki-Jagen, undergo an 
elastic collision with the neutron 
star’s field, picking up energy — and 
then Jump to Abbe IV. Spectacular 
and cheap — a twinning devoutly to 
be wished. 

Aboard the L. S. Caton , of 
course, it was a nudge in the night. 
They had only minimal sensors out- 
side their magnetic envelope, just 
enough to pick up navigation data 
from us — again, because it’s cheap 
that way. Though the L. S. Caton 
was a mass of tachyons, the gravita- 
tional deformations of Jagen swung 
it around precisely like ordinary 
matter — gravity plays no favorites. 
There are, some say, stars and 
planets in Jump space; but no one 
has ever lingered near them. Some 
of the deeper physical laws seem 
asymmetric; tachyon galaxies may 
well be deadly to us. 

Gharma, efficient and proper, 
showed me the Fleet procedures; I 
made notes for study later. “You 
know what we are, Mr. Gharma?” 

I said after an hour or two of detail 
work. “Brokers.” 

“Sir?” 

“Look, stow that ‘sir’, Lapan- 
thul, leastwise when we’re alone.” 

“Ah, how do you mean, ‘bro- 
kers?’ ” 

“We’re in-between men. Take an 
item from Mr.. A, exact our percent- 
age, and give it to Mr. B.” 

Gharma smiled. “This seems in- 
glorious?” 

THE STARS IN SHROUD 



I shrugged. “I don’t care.” And 
was surprised to find that, in truth, 
I didn’t. Running Veden Control 
was grub work in the eyes of the 
likes of Tonji, but so what? 

The scoop ships, gulping down 
interstellar hydrogen with a giant 
magnetic throat and spewing it out 
the end for propulsion, were the 
long-term backbone of the Empire, 
little publicized. 

A planet that sent out, say, a rare 
alloy plentiful only in their system, 
couldn’t program the ramscoop ship 
for a definite destination because 
by the time the ship spanned a 
hundred parsecs at sublight speeds, 
its target world might have changed 
economic structure entirely. The 
time lag was too great. 

So the volume of space around 
Lekki-Jagen served as a storage 
area, a cosmic clearing house of the 
Empire. Moving large masses 
through Jump space was beyond the 
resources of a new colony planet. 
But ramscoops were cheap and 
easy to build. When the colony got 
a product it thought might sell — and 
so bring in currency and bartered 
goods in return — it packed a ship- 
ment into a ramscoop and pro- 
grammed the onboard computer for 
Lekki-Jagen. When the ramscoop 
arrived a half century later, it was 
cataloged and directed into a wait- 
ing orbit. 

There it sat. If no other colony 
bid for it, the ramscoop orbited si- 
lently forever, costing its owners 
periodic docking fees to pay for 
Veden’s Fleet Control. Usually it 
sold rather soon. Then it was repro- 
grammed for the buyer’s system, 
dropped through the Flinger and 
shot out into deep space at a re- 



99 




spectable velocity. The Flinger 
could cut fifty per cent off the 
transit time of a fifty-parsec jour- 
ney, because without it the scoops 
required long, weary, expensive 
years to pick up their initial veloc- 
ity. The Flinger cut down the trans- 
port time for interstellar commerce, 
making possible the economic Em- 
pire. 

Thus I was — quite literally — 
master of a million ships. They 
were all ramscoops forming a great 
pancake of orbits in the plane of the 
ecliptic. Virtually every day we re- 
ceived bids for certain ships — 
lately, I noted, ones packed with a 
craftsman’s lifework in micro- 
electronics — and, if it met the 
demand of the seller, I ordered it 
dropped through the Flinger. The 
key point was that a ramscoop ex- 
pended great energy if it had to 
reach one per cent of c, but the ride 
was easy after that. Above this crit- 
ical velocity, enough hydrogen 
isotopes crammed into its maw to 
feed the fusion fires in its belly; it 
then quickly boosted to 0.8 c or 
higher. The Flinger slung scoops 
out at around 0.0 c, and saved the 
Empire a fortune on each launch. 

“How long is this going to last, 
Lapanthul?’ ’ 

“Pardon, Director?” (Since I’d 
ruled out ‘sir’, he’d found a substi- 
tute.) 

“Jagen is spiraling into Lekki.” 

** Yes. 91 

“When do they touch?” 

“Several thousand more years, at 
least.” 

“It seems odd that we — the 
human race — would come along at 
precisely the right moment to make 
use of this resource.” 

100 



Gharma laid his head onto a 
shoulder, the Veden gesture of ac- 
ceptance. “Director, ‘Each fresh 
day is a special case.’ A saying 
from our rituals.” 

“Urn.” 

“Man is a fortunate being.” 

“Uh huh.” 

★ * * 

When I reached home that eve- 
ning, the orange luster of dusk was 
settling across the water. Flittering 
sounds of things in flight echoed 
from the lake. Spindly ferns clothed 
my home in brooding quiet. I re- 
membered the assassin, then dis- 
missed the thought. As I walked up 
the front ramp, I noticed a mark on the 
glass wall of the den, and beneath it 
a white bird lay sprawled in death 
on the patio. It was larger than a 
dove and had delicate striations of 
blue and pink over its neck. Evi- 
dently it had failed to see the glass 
and had flown straight into it, 
breaking its back. 

Patil admitted me and announced 
that dinner would be ready shortly. 
He mentioned the girl and I asked 
for her. 

She came into the den, padding 
softly on the thick rug. She was 
tall, a trifle thin, and wore a sansari 
of rough, durable green weave that 
set off her black hair. 

“I though I would ask you a few 
questions about the incident this af- 
ternoon,” I said, my voice curi- 
ously stiff. She nodded. “Your 
name?” 

“Rhandra Minadras of the family 
Talin.” 

“Why were you in the street? 
Were you shopping?” 



GALAXY 




“No, I was searching employ- 
ment. I was reared in the country, 
in agricultural arts. But recently I 
decided to come to Kalic and at- 
tempt something new. I thought the 
traditional shops would want un- 
skilled labor.” She spoke quickly 
but not with a sharp tone, and looked 
down at her feet occasionally. 

“You know the Lancers?” 

She hesitated, shy. Then she 
looked up at me and, seeing that I 
was not intent on grilling her — as, 
doubtless, the police had; I 
should’ve thought of that — some of 
the spirit that twinkled behind her 
dark, restless eyes came forth. 

“I’ve heard of them, met a few. 
They say their ‘demonstrations’ are 
just sport, but I think not!” 

“Why?” 

“They’re afraid. Afraid of the 
Quam and what might happen if 
they reach Veden.” 

“Strange, for the young to fear 
so much.” 

“Oh, no,” Rhandra said, looking 
up in surprise, unselfconscious now, 
eyes widened, “they are the least in 
phase. They have not yet come to 
compromise with the strains of 
adolescence, or cultivated the old 
ways. I wouldn’t expect them to be 
as secure as an older man.” 

“Perhaps,” I said, uncomfortably 
aware that I was an older man and 
felt blessed little inner peace of late. 
“There was never anything like 
them before, was there?” 

She shook her head, liquid hair 
rippling. “Not that I’ve heard. But 
I'm new to Kalic.” 

Patil entered and announced din- 
ner. I stood and felt a sudden 
twinge of soreness in my back, a 
reminder of the scuffle. “New? 



You have no lodging, then? Stay in 
my guest room until you find some- 
thing suitable.” 

She made the usual gestures of 
refusal, but eventually accepted. It 
was clear she had few plans. My 
reasons for making the offer were 
equally vague; I was attracted to her 
by some elusive chemistry not 
merely sexual. 

Rhandra excused herself for a 
moment to change into more formal 
dress. She appeared a moment later 
in something clinging, and walked 
over to the glass wall overlooking 
the patio. She stood looking at the 
mist drift in from the lake. 

Suddenly a large bird dropped 
down from the ferns on wide, pow- 
erful wings and glided by parallel to 
the house, peering in at us with 
electric yellow eyes. She jumped 
back, startled, and thumped against 
a wooden column. She gasped and 
abruptly began crying uncontrolla- 
bly. I hesitated, awkward. Then I 
held her, comforted her. The sound 
she made, butting into the massive 
unyielding wood, reminded me of a 
bird smashing into a glass wall.

It did not happen that evening, or 
the one thereafter, but there was a 
glacial momentum to the event that 
gradually made the expectation of it 
fill the air between us, like a thin 
fog through which we spoke. Once 
we recognized it, there was an odd 
tingling moment when we mutually 
agreed to burn away the mist and 
when it was done, we could say the 
things we’d both been thinking and 
our false uniforms — mine particu-

larly bulky — fell away. It was 
amazing, a revelation, to act with- 
out thinking, to find that my old 
body, with its calluses, wrinkles, 
bony knobs and suet softenings, 
aging now — the first signs were 
obvious — could be fun again. In this 
there lay a betrayal of the spirit I 
felt the last nights on Earth, a dis- 
missal of the smooth and solemn 
couplings Angela and I shared. 

There is a moment, in each life, I 
suppose, when you have passed 
your catechism and are free at last 
to believe or disbelieve — it is only 
parents or society or God knows 
who else who Make The Rules — 
and discover life once more, fresh, 
on your own. So I did. She made 
my body like a bauble again, a toy, 
a joy. No one had done that for me 
since Angela, a very long time. 

Nobody. Perhaps this is merely a 
confession that there are few great 
loves in a life (virtually all of us 
can make that confession, sad to 
say). 

Or perhaps it was the way 
Rhandra would look at me. (Kneel- 
ing on my bed in a moist tangle of 
sheets, arms at her side in the wash 
of yellow morning light, hands 
stretching as she awakened.) It was 
a look that opened up some new 
perspective for me, a fresh conti- 
nent hanging in the air. It was the 
first time these doors had opened 
for her. (I know, there must’ve 
been a farmboy somewhere, and — 
upon asking her— it turned out there 
was. Or rather, several. But the dif- 
ference was one of kind.) She and I 
explored these lands together, using 
the traditional tools — a lusty, seem- 
ingly accidental liking for die same 
things, plus workable instincts and 

102 



the familar gummy organs, full of 
their own self-wisdom. It filled me, 
drained nothing. No life-swallowing 
obsession, this: I worked, Rhandra 
found weaving and other crafts 
she’d always wanted to try, and life 
went on. A Commandant is allowed 
some latitude, socially (thus 
Jamilla, that first night). I used it. 
So in those first weeks I reworked 
myself, under our mutual alchemy, 
making a sagging bag of bones and 
brain and guts into a new instru- 
ment.

Fleet is a political organism. It 
needs support among all client 
worlds. A traditional function of my 
position was to solidify such sup- 
port. 

“You may be especially in- 
terested in this, sir,” Gharma said 
blandly one morning, laying an en- 
graved card on my bare desk. “It is 
an invitation from the First Bridge 
Society.” 

“First Bridge? Odd name.” 

“A very exclusive private club, 
Commandant. The original ram- 
scoop that colonized Veden had a 
strict discipline system. Highest- 
ranking officers were from the first 
level of the flight-control bridge. 
The navigators. The club carries 
now the same connotation.” He 
lowered his eyes. “The previous 
Commandant was a member.” 

Ah. This was the first tentative 
feeler for the sort of social acquanit- 
ances a Director and Commandant 
was expected to make among the 
natives. 

“Decline it,” I said, and cut off 
GALAXY 




his startled reply. “I’m not in- 
terested.” 

“Sir, it is virtually a tradition.” 

“Here’s where it stops being 
one.” 

Majumbdahr, standing nearby, 
permitted himself a hint of a smile. 
And later implied, with a side 
comment, that the First Bridge 
types were dreadful bores. 

But I did attend a few handshak- 
ing fests, in part because Rhandra 
was a more outgoing creature than 
me and wanted to see the mysteri- 
ous struttings of Kalic society. She 
even persuaded me to spend half a 
day at the Temple of the Madi, one 
of the more revered centers. 

The Madi turned out to be a 
heavy woman, her lips a glaring red 
gash among swelling hills of cheek 
caked with lemony powder. Her 
first salutation, “Director Sanjen, 
this is quite unexpected — ” ignored 
the simple fact that, were I unex- 
pected, she wouldn’t be there in 
ample robes to greet me. Their 
temple was imposing, a large dome 
like a sprouting bulb frozen as it 
popped from the ground. We en- 
tered beneath a sloping parabola of 
grained obsidian, which in turn 
served as fulcrum for an arc that 
spanned the lofty pink. 

After much talk of Kundalini, the 
vital serpent, the Madi took us on a 
tour of the schools. There were earn- 
est lectures on conservation of the 
vital fluids; attempts to revive the 
lost Old India art of levitation; men 
who could pop steel bands wrapped 
around their chests; men who, it 
was advertised, could through will 
power and proper body control, 
raise the temperature of a room five 
degrees — or lower it; people who 



spoke to hallucinations; men who 
lived, though buried alive for hours; 
women who whispered to tumbling 
copper balls and beads and made 
them leap and dance; a first-order 
Yogi who could stop his heart for 
two minutes; walkers on water. 
Some feats were startling, others 
looked like sly amateur magic. The 
more fantastic were not as 
advertised — the water-walker was 
getting better at it and had per- 
formed for small select groups of 
believers before, but, uh, found his 
spiritual essence hampered by the 
presence of doubters. 

More to pass the time than any- 
thing else, I asked the Madi, “You 
believe Yoga can counter loss of 
phase?” 

“Perhaps, in time.” She waved a 
silken handkerchief at the gnarled 
man, who was now beginning the 
ritual again. “But that is surely not 
the point. These things must be re- 
alized with the heart and spirit, not 
merely with the mind. It may take 
you a while to come to such knowl- 
edge.” She made a pause. “Cer- 
tainly, Director, we shall be pre- 
pared to help you.” 

“Ah. Quite.” 

“The Benagathaman is more than 
you might assume ,” she said, smil- 
ing, “coming as you do from 
the . Monguls. We are an age- 
less movement. The original faith of 
the ancient Asia. Not the deformed 
faith you have known, Director. 
The difficulties I hear you and your 
comrades are finding with those 
aliens, the, the — ” 

“Quarn.” 

“Yes, Quarn. I think it is simply 
a matter of the wrong spiritual av- 
enue.”

“Urn. Perhaps.” 

Rhandra and I lifted off into a 
brimming violet Lekki sunset, skip- 
ping the evening feast at the Temple 
and sundry other consolations of 
public religion. 

“You told me this would be a 
look at the faiths of Veden,” I said 
to her in an accusing tone. 

“Uh . yes.” 

“It was terrible.” 

“Right,” she said with a shrug 
of her shoulders, her wry smile 
apologizing for her countrymen. 

The sects in the dome were fairly 
recent offshoots of the traditional 
Hindic religious line. Their absorp- 
tion in the cheap tricks of Yogi, in 
the pseudo-rationalization by which 
the beautiful parable of Kundalini’s 
passage had been debased into exer- 
cises of the stomach muscles, and 
all the rest — it was a falling back 
into the dark past, reliance on grav- 
en images and Gods, an abandon- 
ment of the peace and serenity of 
the Hindic society. 

They didn’t know it, but these 
cults and the Lancers were 
symptoms. Hindic Veden was de- 
caying. 

Because of the Quam? Possibly. 
When the disease is unknown, any 
symptom may be important. 

But perhaps Veden was simply 
going bad at the core, like the Em- 
pire itself. 

Fleet Control had an efficient 
rumor-mongering service and its re- 
sults were duly logged into remote 
readout storage for use by the Di- 
rector. 

Most of the information was 
worthless. But some reports spoke 
of a rise in crimes of violence that 
were hushed up by the close-knit 

104 



Hindic family structure; the sudden 
influx of mentally disturbed cases in 
medical centers; a pattern of break- 
down in the rural areas that caused 
the young to move into the cities. 

I peered out the plastiform bubble 
over our skimmer and watched 
lights wink on, bright sentinels 
against the reddening dusk. In the 
west of Kalic, the inexpensive 
homes, families were performing 
their ritual chants for solidarity be- 
fore the serving of the evening 
meal. Properly rendered, it brought 
contentment and security without 
the dullness of orthodoxy or the 
weight of dogma. 

Without something — rituals, the 
Sabal Game, wise ministering of the 
guru — a man could slide into the 
weak fragmentation of the Plague. 
So went the conventional wisdom. 
Solidarity through ritual. Man’s 
mind divided into three separate 
houses — reptilian, lower animal, 
and cerebral cortex. Society had to 
govern each; the history of Earth 
had proven as much. Otherwise, 
there would be massive loss of 
phase. As I had lost it. 

Order was breaking down. Must 
empires always fall? Was there 
some fatal mechanism in man that 
hated permanence? 

I shook my head, raging against 
the night. Rhandra sat brooding in 
the seat next to me, her hair like 
rippling shadows. She had been dis- 
turbed by the Temple of Shiva as 
well. She came from simple rural 
origins and was breaking away, but 
it was clear the contorted Yogi was 
not her answer. 

I laughed inwardly to myself. 
Poor thing, she was just as confused 
as I. I reached over and held her 



GALAXY 




hand and she smiled shyly at me in 
the darkness. 

We landed near my home, on a 
flat pad settled into the hill. Patil 
was waiting there with a message 
which had just been forwarded by 
the watch at Fleet Control. 

Quam had been sighted near 
Calning, the large colony only 
Fifty-three lights from Lekki. A 
scouting party was observed and fled 
into Jump space. 

It might be a preliminary for an 
attack on Calning. And it might 
not. The aliens had made feints be- 
fore. 

But it did mean something. The 
Quam were striking further into the 
Empire’s shrinking sphere. 

The sickness was worst at the 
contact points like Regeln. It spread 
along the Jump ship lanes, as I had 
guessed before. 

A ripple, its amplitude decreas- 
ing. But spreading, always spread- 
ing. 

Angela, Chark, Romana — 

I saw them suddenly, mired in 
quicksand, reaching out, silent and 
beseeching, mouths awry — 

They were secondary cases. They 
had gotten it from contact with hu- 
mans, not through the Quam. They 
would take much longer. If indeed, 
I had left them only to die . 

I wrenched my thoughts away. 

And here . 

Veden, storage house. A link of 
the Empire, where Fleet served as 
accountant for the Member Worlds. 
Unexciting but vital. 

How could I protect against 
something as patternless as entropy 
itself? 

We wouldn’t be safe much 
longer.

PART IV

So the days tumbled down. The 
worst times were the mornings, 
when I would rise with a dizzy reel- 
ing in my head. Nothing seemed to 
cure it. Inserting my shielding con- 
tacts filmed Veden in shimmering 
light and invariably lifted my 
spirits, but often only Rhandra’s 
massaging of my neck muscles 
would steal the tension from me. 
When first I arose, I sensed a hum- 
ming in the room, and several times 
dumbly pawed about the draperies, 
seeking its source, until logic pene- 
trated and I realized it came from in- 
side my head. 

Rhandra would follow my wan- 
derings, dimples riding on the crest 
of her smile, and coax the first bit 
of breakfast lychee or somosha into 
me. She had a ritual joke: only the 
devotees of a small sect, the Fala- 
quin, still practiced the ancient in- 
ponderable rite of ingesting natural 
alcohols, of the sort used before 
mankind knew how to remove the 
hangover-inducing effects — was I 
attempting to enter the Falaquin Or- 
ders? And I would smile and shake 
my head and mutter that no, I’d 
been sipping no ancient mystifiers 
on the side, this was probably some 
adjustment to Veden that needed to 
run its course. Biospheres are never 
alike; Veden was not Earth. Cen- 
turies of terraforming had still left 
many differences, from a pink pol- 
len that made my ears itch to an 
hypnotic femweed that I had to 
avoid. 

One particular day when my 
morning revival waxed long, 



105 




Rhandra tugged me out of my 
routine and down to a sprawling 
arm of Old Kalic. It had been the 
navel of the continent, Baslin, in 
the first century of terraforming and 
colonization. It reeked of ancient 
ways, a Babylon, Sumer and 
Nineveh crouched along a mud- 
streaked river. Even at early hours 
the streets were a jumble of 
rickshaws, herds of panting water 
buffalo, camels straining under huge 
bundles, cows meandering. A gang 
of cortically augmented elephants 
shuffled in the dust, doing road 
work without human supervision. 
Along the river Brahmins and 
Sadhus and Hindics on pilgrimage 
were bathing in the river, wringing 
water from their oiled hair, praying 
rhythmically, brushing their teeth, 
doing Yoga exercises. Votaries 
danced, clacking. Temples lined the 
narrow twisting streets that smoked 
with dust. 

Rhandra and I took a creaky, 
shallow-bottomed boat along the 
river, hired from a brown man who 
scowled at us and flashed, when he 
thought we didn’t see, angry white 
teeth. We glided silently. Corpses 
were being washed and put into the 
cremation flames, licking thick 
plumes of smoke rising from the 
pyres. Dogs and ravens poked at the 
charred remains. 

Effective visions, yes. Yet I 
knew teams plucked the bodies 
from the river downstream, cleaned 
the burning grounds, sprayed the 
area nightly. The animals were 
treated, freed of disease. All this, to 
blend the ancient with the present. 
There were sound sociometric calcu- 
lations for each nuance. 

I pointed to clotted crowds on the 

106 



far shore. “Big group.” 

“A savant,” Rhandra murmured. 

“Let’s go.” 

She frowned, studying the center 
of the crowd. “I think not ...” 

“Why? I’m interested.” I threw 
the tiller over and we swerved 
sidewise in the current. 

“No. Really, don’t.” 

“I’ll only be a moment.” 

We ran aground. I stepped off 
into the brown water. Pulled the 
boat up. Squished ashore. 

“Ling, come back.” 

“Nonsense. Majumbdahr is al- 
ways urging me to see more of — ” 
I said, turning, and was staring into 
the face of a big meaty man, cen- 
timeters away. 

“I have come to learn,” I said. 

“You are not allowed.” 

“Come, fellow.” I started to 
walk around him. He blocked my 
way. 

A Commandant should always 
have respect for the ways of the 
world he defends. Still, something 
in this man’s manner irritated me. 
There was something here I sought. 

“I came only to see,” I said 
mildly . 

He didn’t bother to reply. He 
simply shoved me. 

“Now ...” I held up a hand. 
He pushed me again. 

I began to get angry. But he was 
a big man and he seemed fanatically 
intent, his eyes flinty black darting 
insects. 

I backed away. By all rights I 
could walk anywhere on Veden, as 
Fleet Commandant. But while train- 
ing teaches you the rules, experi- 
ence teaches the exceptions. I took 
Rhandra by the arm and waded 
back to the boat. 



GALAXY 




The man stood stolidly at the 
shoreline, watching us pole out of 
sight. His riveting attention pricked 
at my intuition; I tried to see who 
was discoursing at the center of the 
crowd. The distance was too far. 

I could make out a murmuring 
voice, but no more. 

2 

Imagine a river: flecked with 
foam, swirling and rushing, collec- 
tor of oddments of debris, bits of 
dirt, crumbs of civilization. 

The Empire is thus. The random 
currents deposited their burden on 
Veden and departed, in each instant 
changing. 

The Jump ships, however much 
glamor is theirs, were only a frac- 
tion of the traffic that passed 
through the Flinger. 

Most of the Jump ships were en- 
gines of war. Merchants used the 
more modest ramscoops since they 
aren’t supported by taxes from hun- 
dreds of worlds. 

Fleet Control dropped them 
through the Flinger at an average 
rate of one a day. As well, one in- 
coming scoop per day had to be 
laser-guided through the last stages 
of deceleration and coaxed into a 
stable ellipse. 

That represents a numbing flux of 
information. I had to oversee a lot 
of it, make decisions about anything 
out of the ordinary. 

Although the scoops and Jump 
ships slingshotted regularly through 
the Flinger, very few of them ever 
sent anything down to Veden. 
There was no reason. Veden had 
few rare raw materials, no advanced 
technology, few cultural objects of 

THE STARS IN SHROUD 



interest to the predominantly Mon- 
gul Empire. We usually got a squirt 
of news or correspondence on 
high-frequency laser, and that was 
it. Usually. 

“What’s this?” I asked Gharma 
one day. “The Chennung, Jump 
Class IV, is dropping a one-man 
flyer.” 

“A moment,” he said, thumbing 
a readout. “Yes. A replacement for 
the astronomical observatory.” 
“Observatory? Where?” 

“On the other side of Veden.” 
“There’re only a few islands 
there.” 

“Correct,” Gharma murmured 
pedantically. “They have fewer 
signal/noise ratio troubles if they 
are shielded from us here.” 

“Ah.” I approved it and tapped 
it through to store-and-forward. 
“What’re they watching? Optical 
work?’ ’ 

“No. Gravitational radiation.” 
“Uh? Why?” 

“Lekki-Jagen.” 

Radio waves are generated by 
electrons jiggling back and forth in 
a wire. Two masses, waltzing about 
each other, make gravitational 
waves at the frequency of their rev- 
olution. 

“The signal from Lekki-Jagen is 
big enough to measure?” I said 
wonderingly. “Incredible.” 

“Gravitational radiation is an im- 
portant energy loss. Eventually they 
will spiral into each other because 
of it.” Gharma blinked at me owl- 
ishly. 

“How old was the astronomer 
who recently retired?” 

Gharma checked his readout. 
“The man died at age 124.” 

“Impressive. I’d heard you live 

107 




longer here, because of the lighter 
gravity.” 

“There are other causes for our 
good health,” G harm a murmured 
with a slight smile. 

I chuckled. “What you really 
mean is that the helter-skelter of the 
Empire doesn’t penetrate here, eh? 
And you’re right. The social pres- 
sure-cooker on Earth probably cuts 
a decade or two from our lifespan. 
Maybe that accounts also for the 
higher spiritual state you Vedens 
have achieved.” 

Gharma’s smile changed a frac- 
tion as he saw that my words carried 
a touch of mocking. “That should 
be better judged by an outsider.” He 
said judiciously. 

“Mere cliche sociology, I’m 
afraid. On Earth our introduction to 
the Sabal Game comes only after 
age twenty-five. Below that age 
physiology makes meditation and 
group perception difficult.” 

“So that longevity assures en- 
lightenment?” he asked somewhat 
stiffly. “But so many decades of 
playing a . game . does not 
boredom set in?” 

“No. No.” Sudden sense of loss. 
I glanced at Gharma. “I don’t be- 
lieve it was boredom that drove me 
out.” 

Gharma muttered something, 
perhaps embarrassed that he had 
triggered a sadness within me. 

“1 wonder — is Veden so differ- 
ent? Are there different paths open 
to me here? I — ” I broke it off, 
voice suddenly thick, and waved 
Gharma away. I thought for a 
while, my mind a muddle, and then 
pulled myself back into the worka- 
day world around me. 

I leaned back and regarded the 

108 



display screens. Again the idea 
swam up to consciousness — why 
had we come along at this special 
time? This singular moment when 
Lekki-Jagen made an efficient 
Flinger, but before gravitational 
radiation bled them of energy and 
the two smashed together? 

There is a rule in astronomy, the 
Principle of Mediocrity. It says that 
our position in both space and time 
is more likely to be average than 
special — simply because, unless 
there is evidence to the contrary, 
more intelligent races will be bom 
in average, mild conditions. There’s 
an escape hatch, of course: the fact 
that we’re here when the universe is 
about eighteen billion years old is 
caused by the time necessary to 
evolve intelligent life — roughly, ten 
or twenty billion years, and what’s 
a billion between friends? Still, the 
principle made me stop and wonder. 
The Flinger was almost too good to 
be true, a gold mine for the Empire. 
What were the chances that we’d 
blunder onto it and find a planet we 
could terraform nearby? Or were we 
like summer hikers in the forest, 
coming upon a feast picnic lunch all 
laid out, glasses brimming with 
sweet lemonade, but no picnickers? 

I shrugged. Things happen, that’s 
all. 

* * * 

One morning, amid the buzzing 
in my head, I found faint memories 
of a dream. Of Angela, of the chil- 
dren, of the Slots. Were they there 
now? In the dream I walked down 
slimy halls with yellow gobbets 
streaking the walls. People were 
stacked like so many lumps of or- 

GALAXY 




ganic goo, to be tended and noted 
and, when they died, disposed of. 

When I found them, there were 
three holes together, each barely 
large enough to crawl in and 
crouch. I ran away. 

It isn’t sleep that knits the raveled 
sleeve of care. It’s work. 

* ★ * 

I set up regular training classes 
for the troops in riot control and 
internal security. The men re- 
sponded well, glad to be acting 
again, but troubled (I suspected) at 
this first evidence of concern among 
Fleet Control. 

Jagen, the Black Dwarf, spun in 
tune. Veden was subject to a bien- 
nial coincidence between Lekki, 
Jagen and its moon; an enormous 
tide rose and smashed itself against 
the lowlands. Winds roared and 
Fleet Control buttoned up for three 
days. We evacuated a few thousand 
persons from the mountain peaks in 
the east of Baslin, where the gusts 
battered at three hundred klicks per 
hour. 

Over the next few months I re- 
ceived more reports of theft and 
beatings in the cities. Majumbdahr 
managed to penetrate some of the 
natural Hindic reserve in local 
officialdom against reporting such 
incidents, and thereafter we got a 
reasonably accurate picture of what 
was happening. The curve for 
small, random, purposeless crime 
had a steep positive slope. 

The rumor-mongering facility 
picked up more whispers about 
Quam spies, planned Quam land- 
ings, suspected neighbors, sightings 
of strange ships in the skies. 

Domestic issues came and went. 



Majumbdahr and Gharma handled 
them. I kept myself isolated, 
romped with Rhandra, seldom at- 
tended Official functions. The Madi 
called, sent invitations, implored me 
to visit the Temple of Shiva again, 
to follow the lessons they offered, 
to come to banquets and receptions. 
I was invited to join social clubs, 
attend concerts, clasp the moist 
palms of a hundred strangers. 

“If you don’t want to go, ignore 
them,” Rhandra said innocently, 
batting aside five centuries of Fleet 
tradition. 

So I did. 

Instead, we walked the streets of 
Kalic. I joshed with Krishna priests 
in yellow dhotis and shaved heads, 
able to see it all as social cement 
now, free at last of what the Game 
had meant to me. 

We flew through valleys crystal- 
line with the sparkle of fresh rain, 
swooped over the leafy roof of 
jungle. We peered over the raw 
rock margin at the lowlands. They 
shimmered as though in mire, three 
kilometers down from the great 
mesa of Baslin. There were legend- 
ary beasts there, giants who 
sucked in the thick air and broke 
men like eggs. 

In the jungle we surprised some- 
thing and, rather than retreat, fol- 
lowed the sounds of its thrashing. It 
was a scorpion, two meters long 
with a curled stinger like a deer 
horn. It could run as fast as a horse. 
I shot to the side of it three times 
and then had to put a bolt into the 
scampering legs. Rhandra took a 
long time getting to sleep that eve-

THE STARS IN SHROUD

And always at my back, like a 
murmur in the distance you can’t 
resolve into coherent words, were 
the Quam. 

They were deft. When Fleet 
computers war-gamed a probable 
assault on a given star, dozens of 
ships would mass and wait. The 
Quam hit elsewhere. 

The solution seemed obvious: the 
vast computer minds were operating 
on false premises. They thought in 
terms of feints and shifts, subtle 
balances of power and advantage. 
They assigned points to men and 
ships, solved endless integral equa- 
tions to assess the economic impli- 
cations of a given loss. 

Clearly, the Quam did not think 
that way. The sickness spread along 
the most-traveled Jump lanes, but it 
also struck isolated worlds. Could a 
few Quam infiltrate such planets 
and have a determining effect? 

They were near now. Four 
months after the sortie against Caln- 
ing the same scenario I had seen on 
Regeln went through its grinding 
logic again. Communication winked 
out. 

By now Fleet sent no expeditions 
to rescue survivors. They had 
learned enough, I suppose. Over the 
next few months two more colonies 
fell in much the same manner. 

Fleet subspace transmissions men- 
tioned them a few times, at first 
with alarm and then subtly skirting 
the issue. Then they were gone. We 
were advised to not speak of these 
planets again. 

In Fleet engagements two of our 
Jump ships were lost to unknown 
causes. They simply vanished, 
ceased transmission. 

Four Quam ships were observed 

110 



to self-destruct to avoid capture. 

After all this time we still knew 
next to nothing about the Quam. 
Analysis showed that they had a 
tolerance to acceleration about the 
same as men — assuming the ships 
were not automatic. They reacted 
occasionally to laser signals tuned 
to infrared frequencies. Their ships 
bore no distinguishable markings. 

Somehow this gradually diffused 
into the Veden population. The in- 
formant network picked it up as 
rumors, then as commonly accepted 
knowledge. There were a few inci- 
dents of arson and ridicule of 
police. Political parties that had 
been dormant formed again. Veg- 
etarian cults, merchants’ parties, 
groups in favor of breaking free of 
the Empire; they gained members 
and published newsfax. 

The prominent parties demanded 
to know what defenses had been 
readied for use against the Quam. 
When I first heard this, I laughed — 
did they think anything would stop 
the Quam? 

But gestures were necessary. I 
sent more sensors out on long orbit 
to the edge of the Lekki-Jagen solar 
system. The few thermonuclear 
warheads I had were readied and 
encased in shells with high-power 
ionic boosters. I saturated the vol- 
ume of space around Veden with 
close-orbiting scoopships waiting to 
be purchased; they would provide a 
good screen for orbiting missiles. 

Still, I could only hope to stop a 
few Quam ships. 

The Regeln pattern, though, 
called for no formal invasion at all. 
The colonists on Regeln had been 
disarmed by the Plague. Their de- 
fenses had done them no good. 

GALAXY 




I brooded. Things went on as be- 
fore, I buried myself in routine. 
Was it deceptive? The chants of the 
priests sang in my mind, lulled me. 

Two months later the first Plague 
case was diagnosed on Veden. It 
was a man in Kalic of weak reli- 
gious background and few family 
ties. He did not respond to treat- 
ment.

Rhandra, at my feet — with the 
sweet, silent rhetoric of her deep 
eyes — and Majumbdahr; both re- 
garded me quizzically. 

“Ling, what you’re saying is, 
well, interesting ...” she began, 
“but I don’t see the point.” 

“Why?” 

“Societies like this, ours — ” with 
an arm she swept in all Veden out- 
side our living room — “this is the 
way they are.” 

“And always have been?” I 
prompted. 

“Yes,” she said. “That’s why 
we have such links to the past.” 

“Even though we’re parsecs re- 
moved from Old India.” 

“I agree with her, Comman- 
dant.” 

“Call me Ling; this isn’t working 
hours. But Rhandra, how do you 
think we got here?” 

“Ramscoops,” she said confi- 
dently. 

“Innovation. Generally, human 
societies aren’t responsive to new 
ideas. They’re hierarchical and 
ritualistic — like Veden. But every 
so often the neocortex takes over 
and rides the horse of, well, prog- 
ress.” 



“Progress is an illusion,” 
Majumbdahr said quietly. 

“Spritually, maybe so,” I said 
impatiently. “But there are things 
we know. That the oldest part of 
our forebrains have elements in 
common with the reptiles. That 
above the reptile portion lies a lim- 
bic system, where our emotions are 
primarily lodged. And spreading 
over all that like a capstone is the 
neocortex. Three brains at war in 
one skull.” 

“Why in conflict?” Rhandra 
murmured. She curled delicate feet 
under her, into the soft piles of the 
rug. 

“Evolution proceeds by addi- 
tion,” Majumbdahr said to her, 
somewhat diffidently, I thought — 
because she was the Commandant’s 
woman? 

“Ritualistic and hierarchical, we 
are, yes. “Each major step in brain 
evolution was superimposed on the 
older brain, which probably didn’t 
like the idea.” 

“I still don’t understand what 
that has to do with right- and left- 
handedness,” Rhandra said. 

“Our intuition seems lodged in 
the right hemisphere of the brain,” 
I said. “Verbal and mathematical 
ability is in the left hemisphere. But 
the left hemisphere controls the 
right hand — which is why most hu- 
mans are right-handed. A lot of 
mental illnesses — not loss of Phase, 
the more drastic ones, like 
schizophrenia — are caused by domi- 
nance of the right hemisphere and 
lack of coordination between the 
two. We — ” 

“Ling,” Rhandra said softly, 
“forgive me, but I do not think this 
is the most productive way to ease 



THE STARS IN SHROUD 



111 




into these things. They are not of 
the essence.” 

I grimaced at her. “What is?” 

“You miss the Sabal, Ling. It is 
written all over your face at this 
moment.” 

I sighed, glanced up through the 
skylight. Veden’s moon was mired 
in cloud, a gray ghost. 

“Yes. Yes, I do.” It sounded 
strangely like a confession of in- 
adequacy. 

“There remain spiritual avenues 
open to you . Ling,” Majumb- 
dahr murmured quietly. 

I slapped my knee, stood up. 
“Yeah, I know. Let me be clasped 
to the bosom of Krishna, right?” I 
paced the room, whirled on them. 
“But we must first understand, 
damn it! These ideas aren’t only 
mine — I got them from the research 
being done on the Plague victims on 
Earth. The Quam seem to probe 
deep into those three warring 
brains, to reach back into that lim- 
bic system we have in common 
with the nonprimate mammals.” 

Majumbdahr spread his hands, a 
let’s-be-reasonable gesture. “Then 
we must use our own wisdom to 
counter them. These facets — the 
tribrain, the left-right conflict — were 
resolved by Phase. That is its role.” 

“But it doesn’t work.” 

“So far. Mankind is not 
finished.” 

“Ling,” Rhandra said, “1 be- 
lieve your . disquiet . can be 
resolved by study of our ways here 
on Veden.” 

“They don’t work, either. Read 
the reports.” 

Of late I had rummaged through 
Fleet retrieval codes in search of 
ideas about the Quam, psychoanalyt- 

112 



ic research, anything. There were 
no solutions, only clues. 

Quam victims showed excesses 
of certain natural small brain pro- 
teins such as endorphins. One 
clearly repressed atropine, and we 
had known for centuries that at- 
ropine induced the illusion of fly- 
ing. Did suppressing atropine, 
coupled with other reactions, induce 
fear of open places? So far the rid- 
dle was unsolved. More important, 
how was this done? The restrictions 
on human brain alteration which the 
Covenants laid down six centuries 
ago had blotted out our knowledge 
of such matters; now we needed it 
desperately. So I had begun to 
comb the files and make my own 
tinkertoy models, rummaging, 
searching ... 

“I believe Rhandra is correct, 
Ling,” Majumbdahr said, pulling 
my attention back to the conversa- 
tion. “There are some sa- 
vants ...” and he chimed in with 
Rhandra, both urging me gently, as 
friends do, to release some of the 
tension and dawning anxiety I felt. 

“Maybe you’re right,” I said to 
them, suddenly tired. “I’ll think 
about it.” 

I looked up. The moon had 
ripped its shroud and now swam 
free.

The difference between a convic- 
tion and a prejudice is that you can 
explain a conviction without getting 
angry. This is a dead giveaway in 
negotiations; if your opponent flares 
his nostrils unconsciously before 
speaking, he probably isn’t going to 
abide by any compromise settle- 
ment. 



GALAXY 





The case in point was the outer 
tribes, the jawarls. The people of 
Kalic termed them tribes because 
they followed a more martial Hindic 
tradition, practiced combat Yoga and 
invoked obscure, many-armed gods. 
The jawarls decided that Plague vic- 
tims were a visitation of the evil 
Thingness, and this implied, as the 
night the day, that such people were 
better dead. 

We first learned of these interest- 
ing opinions when three jawarl- 
blessed teams broke into a hospital, 
killed five Plague cases and a nurse, 
and barricaded themselves in a 
wing. The Kalic officials dithered. I 
moved up Fleet troops. The jawarls 
killed the remaining two Plague 
cases and pitched their ritually dis- 
sected bodies into the street. The 
Kalic officials were greatly offended 
and went away to meditate on a 
solution. 

I had selected my men for their 
marksmanship, not their bravery; if 
you have enough of the former, you 
don’t need the latter. 

I left Gharma in charge of the 
front. I took some men around the 
back, thinking the jawarls might 
sneak out that way. The jawarls 
were hard fighters but I thought we 
could face them down. 

We waited. 

Firing came from the front. Small 
arms. 

When I got there, jawarls lay 
around the hospital doors. Blood 
seeped from their blackened 
wounds. 

“What happened?” I asked 
Gharma. 

“They came out.” 

“You gave warning?” 

“Some.” 



THE STARS IN SHROUD 



113 



“Damn it, you were well con- 
cealed. You could’ve parleyed.” 

“They were armed. They ignored 
my first challenge.” 

“And the second?” 

“I firedli warning bolt.” 

“Oh, neat. Very neat. So they 
panicked.” 

“The onus lies upon them,” 
Gharma said stiffly. 

“You should’ve been more care- 
ful.” 

“They were country men. They 
do not acknowledge your Fleet 
niceties.” 

“You made damned sure they 
wouldn’t.” 

“I feel I was justified.” 

Majumbdahr approached and saw 
the carnage. He shook his head, his 
mouth a thin line. 

I looked at Gharma. He knew full 
well that Fleet regs would uphold 
his decision. Behind his icy manner 
was a smug certainty. 

I snorted wearily and turned 
away. 

We lifted out in a twenty-copter 
force then, and caught the council 
of jawarl elders at their daily Dance 
of Self, their tea bowls still steam- 
ing. Such people are either at your 
throat or at your feet; this time the 
negotiations went well. 

★ ★ ★ 

That evening it came again. 

I jerked awake. Rhandra nuzzled 
against my shoulder, a thigh atop 
mine. Outside the night was still. 

The dream returned. 

The chaplain came to her Slot. 
He was a hospital employee. He 
administered the last rites and 
rubber-stamped that fact on a card. 
The nurse closed Angela’s eyes and 

114 



called the orderlies. He witnessed 
the temporary death certificate, 
filled in the Release of Personal 
Belongings form. The body was 
washed, plugged, trussed, wrapped 
in thin sheets — we are neat here — 
and labeled. At the morgue the at- 
tendant loaded the body onto his 
rolling stretcher, waited for an 
empty drop tube, and then took it to 
the morgue icebox in the basement: 
last transport for unwanted goods. 
The autopsy was brief; the machine 
found nothing unusual. I sat outside 
while she was drained, embalmed, 
waxed, rouged, shaved, dressed, 
made ready. 

Two possible ends: a quick, crisp 
incineration, then bones into a 
ceremonial um. Or, at vast expense, 
a precious rectangle of earth, a 
machine chuffing as it lowered her 
in. 

Then the dead children, of 
course. More units passing from the 
Slots. Through the labyrinth. No 
metaphysical mystery, no call from 
the divine. By the time people had 
reached the close-packed Slots, you 
just let them go. The new ethics: 
Thou Shalt Not Kill, but thou may 
allow to die if . 

I woke. 

I rose, paced, sweated. 

Rhandra stirred and then drifted 
back into sleep’s gray peace. I 
moved ghostlike through the 
shadowed living room. Some of my 
familiar morning nausea howled in 
my head. I massaged my neck to 
clear my thoughts. 

Rhandra or no, I was not quit of 
Angela. Did I still love her? Impos- 
sible to say. After a while emotions 
are like old shoes; you forget you 
have them on. Do dreams of death, 

GALAXY 




transposed, mean dreams of love? A 
question I had scribbled on my soul 
and could not now lightly rub out. 

4 

The copters buzzed all around us, 
ringing the area. I lumbered away 
from mine. A thick acrid stench of 
burning buildings drifted down the 
broad street. It seeped in through 
my suit filters. 

Sirens wailed; they were coming 
this way. 

“Majumbdahr!” I called. He 
came trotting over. “What hap- 
pened to that sleeper gas?’’ 

“Ordnance couldn’t locate any 
more,” he puffed. “They used the 
last of it an hour ago. It didn’t stop 

them. ” 

I ground my teeth. No time to 
have a batch made up; I wasn’t 
even sure there was a chemist in 
Kalic who knew the process. 

“Form up the men you have. 
They still carry anamorphine?” 

“Yes, most of them.” He nod- 
ded slowly, dazed with fatigue. 

“Gharma said the Lancers were 
slowing down.” 

“I think they are,” Majumbdahr 
said. He blinked rapidly to clear his 
vision. Smoke drifted across and 
paled Lekki’s great eye. “They’ve 
been going for six hours. Our men 
are sagging, too.” 

“This should be the last of it, 

then, for a while,” I said and sa- 
luted. Another copter decked with a 
whine behind me. Gharma jumped 
out. 

“It’s dying down elsewhere, 
sir,” he reported. 

“About time.” I’d followed the 
riot from Fleet Control since morn- 



ing until I couldn’t stand to be in- 
side any longer. It was good to be 
out in die field and get the taste of 
things. 

Troops formed up in a line across 
the street. The muted bass of the 
crowd deepened. 

“It’s hard to understand,” I said, 
looking at the thin column moving 
up. “Only a month since the first 
Plague victim.” 

“How does it go in most cases?” 
Gharma asked. 

“All I know is what I saw on 
Earth,” I said, trying to shrug in 
my suit. The constant-volume joints 
impaired me. “It wasn’t anything 
like this. People simply waited. 
Sometimes they died. They didn’t 
turn out into the streets, bum and 
loot.” 

“They had more phase, on 
Earth?” 

“I don’t know. I wouldn’t have 
guessed it. There’s something pecu- 
liar about the Veden personality. 
They seem to be coming out from 
under some inhibition at last and the 
pressure is blowing the top off.” 

“The old ways are not enough,” 
Gharma said flatly. 

“Why? Why should they fail 
now?” 

“It is a crisis point,” he said. 
“The order we had is lost.” 

I looked at him closely. Behind 
his plastiform face-shield his skin 
was polished walnut. “ You say 
that? You, believer in formalized re- 
ligion?’” 

“Formalized, yes. Perhaps dead 
as well. When something is finished, 
you cast it aside; We need a new 
social ordering here, a new dedica- 
tion.” 

Two blocks down the mob swept 

115 



THE STARS IN SHROUD 




around a comer and flowed into the 
street. Tinkling of glass. Rough- 
edged cry of frustration. 

I glanced at Gharma. What did 
he mean? How could he watch his 
world dissolve so calmly? He 
looked content. Almost smug. 

The mob streamed toward us. I 
licked away a salty tang of sweat. 
My contact filters stung my eyelids 
when I blinked; I’d been wearing 
them too much, indoors and out. 

I could feel the hollow drumming 
of a thousand running feet. Fifty 
meters in front of me the mob bore 
down on the line of troops. Most of 
the Lancers seemed young. They 
grinned. 

When they were within a few 
meters of the line, my troops fired a 
volley of darts and some went 
down, drugged with anamorphine . 
A canister of homemade gas blos- 
somed in our line and blew away. 

Most of the crowd’s rush halted 
but here and there they broke 
through. Our line wavered. Men 
fell. 

The mob caught the smell of vic- 
tory. 

I suddenly realized I was ex- 
posed. A knot of Lancers dashed by 
me. Gharma was cut off to the left 
with a squad. 

I unhooked my sidearm. 
Majumbdahr shouted orders over the 
suit radio that echoed in my helmet. 

Three Lancers converged on me. 
I took ready position. One carried a 
chain wrapped around his wrist; no 
worry there. The other two had 
cobblestones from the old district 
and one flashed a knife. All rela- 
tively useless against body armor. 

They came at me together in a 
rush. 

116 



I brought the tube of my gun 
down viciously, chopping the first 
Lancer’s arm. The man dropped his 
knife with a gasp of pain. 

I stepped to the left and took a 
blow on my back armor that rattled 
my teeth. The chain whipped 
around my helmet with a crash and 
partially obscured my field of vi- 
sion. 

I crouched and fired two darts. 
They made an angry splatting 
sound. 

Thumb over to extra-strong 
anamorphine. Lancer moving in; 
focus on him. Fire. Miss. Fire 
again. 

He caught it in the groin. 
Staggered away, collapsed. 

One left, now. Turn — where is 
he? 

A bottle bounced off my arm and 
shattered on the sidewalk. 

I heard the whistle of the chain 
again. Duck. 

It missed. He felt the wind, as 
my instructor used to say. 

This time I caught the Lancer be- 
fore he could back away. I cracked 
the gun tube across his kneecap. He 
almost fell on the bottle shards but 
managed to roll to one side. 

I blinked sweat out of my eyes. 
Hot. People all around me. Expand 
attention out, watch for an attack. 

A man appeared from nowhere 
and threw a cobblestone. It hit my 
solar plexus. My armor rang. 

I thrust out with the gun tube. 
The Lancer brought a stick around 
and parried neatly. He backed 
away, glancing to the sides for sup- 
port. 

I raised the muzzle of the gun. 
He danced to the side at just the 
right instant and the dart whizzed 

GALAXY 




past him. 

The Lancer threw his pipe and 
ran. I ducked, fired, missed again. 
He dodged behind Majumbdahr, 
who was coming to help me. The 
crowd was falling back. My troops 
let out a thin cheer and started to 
reform . 

“You all right?” Majumbdahr 
panted. 

“Sure,” I grinned at him. 
“Those fellows can certainly be 
offensive, though, can’t they?” 

5 

We met in a restaurant in Old 
Town. Majumbdahr and Gharma 
had shown surprise when I told 
them they’d find me there, but I 
was bored with the stiffness of my 
official offices, and after the riots I 
needed a quietness. 

Men in severe robes milled 
around the entrance as I went in, 
chattering, comparing notes, point- 
ing at the black fingers twining 
through the sky from still- 
smouldering fires. 

Majumbdahr and Gharma were 
already there, waiting at a cloistered 
table in the back. 

“You’ve recovered from the 
brawl, then?” Majumbdahr said as I 
sat down. 

“Still hurts down my back,” I 
said. “It’ll be sore tomorrow. 
Stupid to get caught out like that. I 
should’ve been up in a copter. How 
about you two?” 

Gharma lifted a steaming fork of 
food and made a face. “Elementary 
violence I can usually overcome. 
The hot Pindang Kol in this restau- 
rant is trying to even the score.”- 

“Pretty bad,” Majumbdahr 



agreed, putting down his fork. “I’m 
glad I wasn’t very hungry.” He 
looked up at me. “Order something 
for you, sir?” 

“Later. I finished my report on 
the copter coming over here. I 
thought Old Town would relax me, 
restore some balance. I won’t have 
the report transmitted to Fleet Cen- 
tral on Earth until I’ve had a chance 
to go over it again.” 

“It must be rather difficult to 
compose,” Majumbdahr said. 

I sighed. “Rather. It’s not easy 
to admit you’re losing control of the 
situation.” 

“Couldn’t you ... in the writ- 
ing .. soften the impact?” 
Gharma said. “Perhaps it’s not 
building as swiftly as we think — ” 
“No. Half-truths are dangerous; 
sooner or later you might inadver- 
tently tell the wrong half.” 

“I agree,” Majumbdahr said, 
hunching down with his elbows on 
the table. “Fleet has the right to 
hear it all, straight.” 

“Especially since this form of the 
sickness is new,” I added. “There 
has never been violence like this be- 
fore. I’ve asked some psychers; 
they don’t understand it. It is out of 
the pattern.” 

Gharma nodded, his face grim. 
“How is the building going?” I 
said to Majumbdahr. 

“On schedule. The hospital space 
can be supplied by preform con- 
struction units, easily deployed. 
The only holdup was in the blue- 
prints.” 

“Blueprints for hospitals? I 
thought they were standard.” 

“I checked standing orders and 
then asked Central on Earth. They 
want us to build close-packed Slots.” 



THE STARS IN SHROUD 



117 




I stared at him for a long mo- 
ment. “I should’ve been told. What 
did you do?” 

‘‘Called in a civilian. Used ordi- 
nary hospital prints.” 

‘‘Good. You’re legally in the 
clear. Local commanders can make 
such changes, as long as there 
aren’t too many of them.” 

Majumbdahr had sensed my 
mood well. I hated the cramped 
Slots and all the memories they 
brought back. 

“I think it was a wise decision 
for several reasons,” Gharma said. 
“The. psychological impact on the 
people would be great.” 

“Yes,” I said, “when you begin 
building those kind of Slots you’ve 
admitted it’s over, you’ve given 
up.” 

“Well, I give up on the Pindang 
Kol,” Gharma said, pushing his 
plate away. “I’ll eat elsewhere.” 

He smiled wanly. The things we 
had left unspoken layered the air. 

They knew as well as 1 that a 
judgement of incompetence against 
a Fleet Director — that is, me — 
would not neglect the Executive 
Officers immediately below him. If 
I went I might well take 
Majumbdahr and Gharma with me. 

‘’Do you think we should stop 
the building of rural retreats, sir?” 
Majumbdahr said. 

“No. Move as many as possi- 
ble out of Kalic and into the re- 
treats. You’ve said before” — I 
glanced at Gharma “ — that Vedens 
are country folk. Maybe they’ll 
snap out of it if we get enough out 
of the cities.” 

“Is there any correlation in the 
background of the rioters?” Gharma 
asked. 

118 



“No, none.” I looked down at 
the table and felt a wave of defeat 
wash over me. “Some are from the 
city, others fresh of the forests. No 
religious similarities. Widely vary- 
ing income levels and education. 
The only thing they have in com- 
mon is that this morning they fi- 
nally got fed up with, it all and 
started burning or hitting a police- 
man or just running down the 
street.” 

“Berserkers,” Majumbdahr rub- 
bed his hands together, thinking. 

“What?” 

“Berserkers. In ancient times the 
natives of the Norse lands on Earth 
had a ritual way to break free of so- 
ciety. Small deviations from the 
conventional weren’t permitted — ” 
he smiled at Gharma — “but if the 
pressure got to be too much, a man 
could run berserk and no one 
bothered him. He could go mad 
until he felt ready to return to his 
life.” 

“You’re implying that’s what 
happened here today?” I said. 

“Perhaps. I don’t know. What 
set them off, why all at once?” 

“It’s not my field,” I said, shak- 
ing my head. “Too much for one 
day.” 

Gharma: “Sir ...” 

“Yes?” 

“There have been reports ...” 

“Of a new sect, the Lengen,” 
Majumbdahr finished. “Gharma and 
I saw some mention of them in one 
of the surveys you ordered. We 
think you should see them.” 

“Look,” I said, blinking wearily, 
“I’ve gotten blessed little help so 
far. There are a thousand cultists on 
every square block in this city. I 
seem to have met every one of 

GALAXY 




them. If there’s nothing special — ” 
“Ah, I think there is,” Gharma 
said seriously. “There is something 
strange— but you should see for 
yourself, sir.” 

“They maintain a compound on 
the border of the jungle, in the farm 
districts,” Majumbdahr said. 

I considered. I was tired, but 
underneath it I felt an odd unease, a 
need to act. 

“I’ll go.” I glanced out a thin 
window nearby. “It will be good to 
escape Kalic, to get outdoors 
again . ‘Outdoors’ — a queer 
word, isn’t it? Arrogant. As if the 
universe were defined by what lies 
outside the places where we 
live. ’’Rambling, rambling, skit- 
tering on a high wire above the 
abyss. I jerked myself back to the 
present. “Dusk is falling. Should 
we be going now?” 

“Yes, I’ll go call a copter. One 
can pick us up a few blocks from 
here,” Majumbdahr said. 

“Delay a bit,” Gharma said. “I 
thought I would check in with Con- 
trol first, sir. I should stay in the 
city. It would probably be best if 
one of us was on duty in case — ” 
“Yes,” I said. “Go with 
Majumbdahr and get an all-points 
report for me before we leave. I can 
review it in the copter. Majumbdahr 
and I will go out alone.” 

Majumbdahr got up, threw a few 
coins on the table. They rang softly 
in the still velvet closeness. Gharma 
rose, saluted a trifle formally, and 
followed Majumbdahr out. 

This last gesture was typical of 
Gharma. Through these months the 
three of us had become friends, but 
I felt much closer to Majumbdahr. 
His spontaneity often broke 

THE STARS IN SHROUD 



through the officer’s crust. But in 
Gharma I still detected an undercur- 
rent of reserve and cool assessment. 

I decided to eat while I waited. 
The copter could wait. I would need 
the energy. And of course it was 
one way to demonstrate to my two 
executive officers that, friends or 
no, they would still wait at my 
leave. 

I ordered the Pindang Kol and a 
biryani, Pindang Kol turned out to 
be a broth of cabbage and root veg- 
etables, salty and thick. It was ter- 
rible. 

* * ★ 

We swooped down into a blotch 
of pale orange light. The Lengen 
compound swam in a sea of black, 
humid jungle. Phosphors picked out 
forests of tents pitched for pilgrims, 
cooking-platform areas of rough 
stone, ricks for meditation. In the 
center billowed a yellow tent. We 
banked toward it and set down in a 
clearing beaten clean by foot traffic. 

“How can you be sure we’ll be 
granted an audience?” I shouted to 
Majumbdahr. 

“I called ahead. They realize you 
have little time.” 

As we stepped off onto Veden 
soil still cooling from the heat of 
the day, a small man rushed out of 
the crowd gathered around our 
official copter. 

“Director Sanjen!” he cried. “I 
have been sent to guide you to the 
Master.” The man was dressed in 
cheap robes. Most of the people 
standing and watching were poor, 
farmer class, or had renounced 
material things to follow the 
Lengen. I nodded and we walked to 
the large tent. The crowd parted as 



119 




we approached. I couldn’t help 
comparing this with the behavior of 
the mobs I’d faced earlier in the 
day. 

The tent was more complex than 
it looked. A maze of rooms kept 
groups of pilgrims separated and al- 
lowed the priests, clad in deep blue 
robes, to move in and out without 
disturbing meditations and rituals. 

We were ushered into a warm lit- 
tle hexagonal room bounded by rich 
folds of cloth. We sat lotus fashion 
before two place settings of many 
bowls, plates and tumblers. There 
were eating sticks from several cul- 
tures, lacquered spatulas and shal- 
low canisters. I wondered what this 
was all about. The quietness stole 
into the center of my tenseness, 
though; I decided to wait it out. 

Presently a low woodwind tone 
sounded in the still air. 

A tall man walked slowly to the 
center of the room. His green robes 
covered him entirely with only a 
shadowed triangular slit for eyes 
and mouth. 1 could see nothing of 
his expression. 

“Finally you come here.” The 
voice was deep and rich with an 
odd inflection. 

I pressed my hands together in 
greeting. “I — ” 

“Begin ritual. Silence. Atten- 
tion.” 

He produced a bowl and began 
pouring a thin liquid into the cups 
before Majumbdahr and me. A 
priest appeared bearing foods that 
steamed in the cool night air. 

We began preparing the food. It 
was to be ladled into the proper 
bowls, mixed in precise propor- 
tions, arranged and ordered. 

After a few moments I noticed a 

120 



rhythm to the procession of plates 
and odors. Salt of fishes. Tang from 
ripe fruit. Rough feel of the 
broadcloth napkins. 

It was warm and soothing. I re- 
laxed and my senses flowed out. I 
looked down on myself as I floated 
in a corner of the tent. Feeling all, 
knowing nothing. 

There was a sudden glaring light. 
I wept. 

And I was there. 

* * * 

Labels, you see, are meaningless. 

Worse, they’re distracting. 

Within a breath of time I focused 
on the exercises. My mind stilled. I 
did not think of how surprising this 
was, of how my present state re- 
sembled something I had known, in 
the past but only achieved then by 
months of contemplation. I didn’t 
consider any of these things. I sim- 
ply was. 

. Let us regard the waters in 
their ways . 

An hour passed, or perhaps a 
moment. 

In pursuit 

Of infinity 

Lose the way 

Thus: serenity. 

“First form,” the Master said. 
“You see.” He leaned toward me 
from his lotus position. Bells tin- 
kled. “First ally the mind. Cannot 
find its own . outside.” He 
made something like a laugh. “This 
is done by not thinking various 
things, one after another.” 

“Unconditional nature?” I asked. 

“Part. Is only part. Beginning.” 

I sat. The world formed, clouded, 
spun away. After a time of absence 

GALAXY 




I returned to my place and focused 
once more on die eating ritual. 
Gradually it released its hold. I was 
coming back to the world. 

But not the world I had left. Now 
I had a place within it. 

— Let the waters, in their ways — 

We moved away from the large 
tent, the Ashram, place of wisdom 
study. I walked slowly and felt the 
pleasant crunch of broken ground 
(glass?) beneath my feet. One thing 
at a time. Focus. 

The Master, I noticed, was very 
tall. Seven feet, perhaps more. Low 
gravity? Focus, focus. 

Majumbdahr and I lifted off and 
climbed swiftly. “You’ve made 
great progress, I believe, sir,” he 
said. 

I felt a comradeship with him. He 
had not reached this state but he 
had pointed the way. He was a very 
good friend. There would be others, 
too, who were close. Community. 

We slipped through the winds 
toward Kalic: winking lights scat- 
tered jewels upon a rug. I thought 
of glass. A glass wall. A bird lying 
beside a glass wall.

Rhandra moved coquettishly on 
me, a smiling imp. The oils on our 
bodies gave eveiy caress a tingling 
after- memory of sensation. 

Her oiled muscles rippled, coax- 
ing me. We both knew it was no 
use; I was finished for that morn- 
ing, energies spent. 

She made a sign, a joke. Crude 
country humor. I laughed. 

A few feet away, beyond the 
glass patio partition, wingmice and 
a jawbird pecked at remains of 

THE STARS IN SHROUD 



breakfast. We were lying on a 
broad cushion, she astride. Lekki 
had just peeped over the afterbeam 
of the house. I was glad I’d put in 
my contact filters. I winked at her. 
We had so much to say — 

The phone chimed. 

She lifted a leg and rolled off. I 
got up slowly, reluctant to leave. A 
button on the phone glowed red, 
emergency pattern, so I hurried. 

“Good morning, sir,” Gharma’s 
voice, tense. “I’ve put Fleet Con- 
trol on emergency alert status. A 
sensor drone has just registered two 
blips out of Jump space, un- 
scheduled.” 

“How far?” 

“Just beyond the edge of the 
planetary system. Doppler shows 
they’re massing into Veden orbit, 
fast.” 

“Got a mass reading yet?” 

“Yes, just came in. Usual ship 
size. Something else, too . well, 
I’ll check that later. Could be a mis- 
take. But the two ships come in 
clearly.” 

“I’ll be there,” I said. 

I took my leave of Rhandra and 
masked my concern with irritation. 
Irritation at the stack of work that 
the sightings promised, at the delay, 
the stupidity of doing a job I didn’t 
give a damn about when I wanted 
to be with Rhandra, to go back to 
the Lengen compound. 

I took a copter to Fleet Control. 
Conversations trailed off into si- 
lence as I marched through the front 
offices. Everyone knew. The news 
was in the gossip mill by now. 

It was much as Gharma had said. 
I watched the flickering readout 
from the mass detector silently. 

“You have all the scoop orbits 

121 




logged into our ballistic programs, 
don’t you?” I asked Majumbdahr. 

“Of course.” 

“Start plotting intersection orbits 
for them. If those two ships keep 
coming, we can probably catch them 
in the backwash from the 
ramscoops.” 

“I don’t think that would be 
wise, sir,” Gharma pointed out. 
“The scoops won’t start smoothly 
with merely the orbital velocities 
they have now. The .intruders will 
have ample warning.” 

I looked steadily at him. “Okay. 
Use the scoop maneuvering rockets 
to alter their orbits and bring them 
in close to the bogies. Then blow 
them up.” 

‘ A fusion explosion?” 

I nodded. 

“It may work. I’ll log it in.” 

I smiled at him wryly. “Don’t 
wony about the expense. I’m sure 
Fleet will stand the cost of a few 
scoops.” 

“What are they, sir?” Majumbdahr 
asked. 

“Quam.” 

For the next few hours I watched 
the small dots drop steadily in to- 
ward the Lekki-Jagen system. Nor- 
mal Fleet operations continued; a 
few colonies bought raw materials, 
organ replacements, sophisticated 
technology or rare metals that 
they’d need a century from now; the 
appropriate ramscoops were cut out 
from the herd and dropped toward 
the Flinger. When they reached the 
rim of the system, the scoops would 
flare into star-bound white gems. 

The computers spun silently, 
guiding and totaling the transactions 
of interstellar finance, transfeiing 
marks in one account to similar 

122 



squiggles in another. I waited, 
watched, pondered. 

In the afternoon reports , came in 
about small incidents in Kalic and 
the provincial cities; arson, random 
destruction. The hospitals were fill- 
ing with Plague victims. The only 
good point the Slots had was that 
they were easy to build; decent 
facilities took longer. A Fleet com- 
munique arrived questioning the 
holdup in Slot construction; I told 
my staff to throw it away. 

Fleet also bothered us for more 
news about the intruders. Any un- 
usual maneuvers? Spectral distribu- 
tion of torch? Any transmissions, at- 
tempts at contact? 

I sent answers and some 
questions of my own. When were 
they going to send me some Jump 
ships? How many wings were 
within striking distance? What was 
my priority? 

I got back equivocating long- 
winded replies. Even if they were 
Quam, two ships weren’t all that 
many, were they? Fleet had numer- 
ous responsibilities, I must re- 
member. Ships were available, yes, 
but only for verified Quam incur- 
sions. These were difficult times. 
Meanwhile, keep us informed. 

“Gharma reporting, sir.” His 
image appeared on a screen beside 
the main display in my command 
module. “I’ve been tracing down 
something I noticed earlier. We 
thought it was a mistake, but it 
holds up under several cross-checks 
of the equipment.” 

“Something on the mass detec- 
tor?” I asked. 

“Yes. It’s coming in normal to 
the ecliptic plane. Under ordinary 
scanning operations it probably 

GALAXY 




wouldn’t be noticed.” 

“What is it?” 

“That’s the problem,” he said, 
and looked a little uncertain. “We 
get a strong signal, but the object is 
fairly far out. Or we think it is.” 

“Think?” 

The main screen showed cross- 
hatching: readout from the detec- 
tors. The two intruders were clearly 
visible. Far above the ecliptic plane, 
almost off the screen, was a small 
fleck. It was rust-red and the 
computer-printed grid lines warped 
around it tightly. 

“Appears to have high mass,” I 
said. 

“We estimate point seven solar 
masses,” Gharma said. “But opti- 
cally we can’t find a thing out 
there. Personally, I think it’s an er- 
ror. The detectors are just barely 
able to pick it up. They could be 
off quite a bit on the mass.” 

“Doppler?” 

“That’s wrong, too. Very high, 
positive.” 

I shook my head. “Keep watch- 
ing it. Let me know if anything 
changes. But don’t waste time — I 
want to know what those other two 
are doing.” 

I didn’t have long to wait. At 
1700 hours they reversed torch and 
started slowing down. They 
skimmed along a path tantalizingly 
beyond reach of the ramscoops. 

Were they taunting us, making 
fun of our defenses? I was sure they 
were Quam. An hour later the 
spectral data came through. There 
were bright lines from fusion 
torches, typically Quam. I squirted 
Fleet a report. 

The report on yesterday’s riots 
went with it, but I didn’t wait 



to get a reaction from the super- 
c channel. I had better things to do. 

★ * * 

Rhandra met me on the balcony 
of my house before I’d shucked 
free of the Fleet boots I still wore. I 
had spoken to her of the Master, 
and now I asked her to go with me. 

She looked at me shyly. “I know 
him.” 

“Huh? How?” Focus. 

“I have, for over a year.” 

“Why didn’t you tell me?” 

“It was not time. The Master 
asked me not to speak of it to 
you.” 

“He. ?” I stopped, confused. 
“I was a convert. Many of us 
are.” 

“Us?” 

“Majumbdahr. It was he who 
suggested I stay on with you. He 
knew better than I your inner na- 
ture.” 

“I gathered you were here of 
your own free will,” I said. 

“I am,” Rhandra said in blank- 
faced surprise. “Oh, I am. Now. 
But then, I was uncertain. The Mas- 
ter had sent me to the city to ob- 
serve, to study. When I fell in the 
street, and you found me, I was 
confused. The Lancers ...” 

“And Majumbdahr told you to 
stay on with me?” 

“Yes. He knew of the Master 
and recognized me as a follower. ’ ’ 
“Ah.” 

“No,” she said, reaching out, 
“you mistake things. We hid noth- 
ing from you.” 

“Oh?” 

“We did not think you ready. 
We waited until your nature seemed 
changed, away from the grim side 



THE STARS IN SHROUD

you showed us when you first ar- 
rived.” 

“What . what is the Master to 
you?” 

“An answer. A partial answer, as 
all answers must be.” She looked at 
me with a simple and open earnest- 
ness, so freely given I had to accept 
it. There was none of the coyness I 
saw when we played together, none 
of the selfless concentration when 
she worked at her weaving, none of 
the ordinary faces of Rhandra I had 
come to know. Any woman worth 
knowing has more facets to reflect 
the light than a gemstone, more 
than one can see in a lifetime. 

She took my hand. “He is a man 
of the farms and the jungles, speak- 
ing of the times that surround us. 
He senses the unease in Veden.” 

“Don’t we all.” 

“You are not angry that 
Majumbdahr and I waited? We 
wanted the rightful moment to 
come.” 

“But it was Gharma, as I recall, 
who first mentioned the Lengen.” 

“He is a follower as well.” 

“He is?” 

“Why, yes.” 

“He seems rather a different sort, 
to me.” 

“We are all different. Ling, but 
the Way is the same.” 

I snorted. My face tightened at 
her jargon of enlightenment. 

“Do you remember the day we 
boated on the river?” she asked 
softly, leaning beside me against the 
railings. Below us a wingfox scrab- 
bled among stones, searching for 
tidbits that might have fallen from 
the balcony. 

“Vaguely. There was some inci- 
dent.” 



“A follower of the Master re- 
buffed you. He knew me; that 
was done at my signal.” 

“Why?” I blurted, startled. 

“The Master had told me it was 
not timeful for you to see him. It is 
his way.” She paused. “I did not 
mean for the man to be 

so . rough.” 

I waved this point away. “No 
trouble. I had the sense to back 
down.” 

“Yes.” 

“Look — are many of my Fleet 
officers also followers of the Mas- 
ter?” 

“Some, I believe. Not many are 
interested in the true roots of the 
spirit, Gharma says.” 

I sighed, suddenly tired. “Uh 
huh.” 

“You are . the anger has 
leached from you?” 

What could I do? I reached out 
and drew her to me. 

★ ★ ★ 

We both saw the Master that 
evening. We thronged the gathering 
grounds beside the Ashram, amid 
hundreds awaiting an audience. A 
functionary spotted me and ushered 
us inside. The rooms of cloth were 
layered with the smell of wax and 
incense, and a smoky murmur filled 
the air from the crowds outside. 
Shortly we were led to the hexag- 
onal room of the Master again, 
and we sat, and we learned. 

Rhandra knew the rituals well. 
The Master was gentle, coaxing the 
responses where I faltered. Clicking 
of implements, flicker of candles. 

The lights quickened. I felt a 
tingling, a humming. The pressure 
of the floor matting lessened. Lights 



124 



GALAXY 




rippled, danced. 

I was moving, moving, but 
. There were screens — metal? 
plastic? — flicking light at me. 

Suddenly, no sound. No grainy 
pressure of floor mat on ankles. 
Lifting. 

I dropped down the long smooth 
tube, a telescope. Rhandra swam 
with me, a warm molecular bed of 
cellular wisdom, receptive, and I 
saw that she was a shadowed inlet 
of rest, precisely what I needed 
when first we met. If there was an 
order in things, it was here. 

And in such a harmony an of- 
kaipan could attain communion. 

. waxy, thick air . 

How does a man feel community 
and gain sense of phase when he 
knows he is despised? He cannot 
enter into the Sabal fully. He might 
think so, struggle a lifetime to con- 
vince himself. But the grip would 
not be sure. 

The Plague was designed for the 
Mongul empire. It spread through 
the Game. 

I saw now that I had always kept 
a part of myself separate. And the 
Plague had brushed by me. Some- 
thing did not click, and though I 
suffered the loss of phase for a 
while, I recovered. 

I escaped because I was a man 
distant from the center. Ton- 
ji . his ambition seemed to have 
protected him. Perhaps to him Sabal 
had been a mere formalism all 
along. 

Angela and the children . they 
must’ve believed more than I. Were 
they now fallen? 

I felt a sudden spurt of joy. I was 
free. I could be anything I wanted. 
My strainings to fit with the Mon- 

THE STARS IN SHROUD 



guls had failed by some thin mar- 
gin. A margin which saved me. 

After a long and lofting time we 
returned, together. 

The Master sat upright, the fall of 
his ruby robes outlining thin legs 
and knobby knees. There was a 
faint musty odor to him and a cowl 
hid his face. What sort of man was 
this, to lead me so well, to know 
what I was? 

Long, delicate fingers in blue 
gloves plucked the implements from 
their stations and set them aside. 
“Nature satisfied,” he said, deep 
bass. “Are many levels. One step, 
then two. Break” — he reached up 
and made a quick snapping 
motion — “then grows.” 

He cocked his head over to lie on 
his shoulder in the Hindic gesture of 
questioning. The air swarmed with 
leaping motes, dust cycloning in a 
cool draft. At the edge of my eyes 
the world shimmered, fresh. 

“Let us regard the waters in their 
lapping, their rising, and be swal- 
lowed by them.” 

7 

I was humming, skittering in a 
high new place, the world crackling 
with brimming energy. 

When we left the Master, I surged 
forward through the crowds, alive 
to my own momentum. I called in 
to Fleet Control, using my copter 
phone. I saluted Majumbdahr 
warmly; there was no substantial 
news. “Sir ...” he said, and I 
saw at once he knew what had hap- 
pened, and that the old Ling was 
shucked away. “There is an invita- 
tion ...” From the Madi, of 
course. 

I decided to go. 



125 




* * * 



We landed a bit roughly, spitting 
gravel to the side. The Madi hustled 
out of the mid-evening darkness. 
Lights winked from the Krishna 
dome looming above us. 

“We are most honored to see 
you again,” said the Madi. She 
fluttered busily. 

Introductions. May I present? 
Yes. “Professor Jampul,” the Madi 
said. A short, emaciated man with 
wrinkled crisp brown skin. Rhandra 
bowed with courtesy. I shook 
hands. Pleasantries flew like birds. 

Others drifted into my field of vi- 
sion, murmured something and spun 
away. I gathered that I was meeting 
people. Couldn’t remember any 
names. I smiled, gave the right 
signs, and said forgettable things. 

“The reception is only now be- 
ginning,” the Madi said. Massive 
doors parted, people swirled like 
tidepools around us. Sandals 
clacked echoes beneath the domed 
egg ceiling far above. Jampul was 
at my elbow, murmuring. He was a 
pedant, a professor of languages; 
the sort of man who can see sin in 
syntax. “Languages?” I murmured. 

“And sects. A most interesting 
subject,” he said. 

“You know the Lengen?” 

“Yes, something of a mystery. 
Many priests and one leader, I 
gather.” 

“You haven’t asked him here?” 

Beside me the Madi shuffled. 
“We tried. He did not seem very 
interested. In fact, we were re- 
buffed." 

Things winding a little slow for 
me. I need air. 

“We would like a place to pre- 

126 



pare ourselves,” I said. “It was a 
hectic journey.” 

“Ah, surely.” Crowd parted, we 
went through. 

Up a shadowed corridor. Thick 
aromas from kitchens nearby, muf- 
fled footsteps. Rhandra with me, 
Madi leading. “If you require 
servants — ” No, shake head. Swish 
of curtain closing on departing rump 
of the Madi. 

Whoosh, sit down. Head a little 
off tilt. Long day or something. 
Rhandra looking at me, puzzled. 

Jump up, grab her. Thrash 
around. Eek, tip over urn. Mad 
pawing. Bang into chair, laughing 
wildly. Sloppy kisses. Imitation of 
enraged ape. Shuffle around room, 
chasing her. She laughs. She scam- 
pers away amid the thick folds of 
air that fill the room, smoke-dense. 
We blunder into a bowl of sweet- 
meats. Both of us fall on them, 
smacking lips. Pop down four at a 
go. Hungry. Meditation takes a lot 
out of a man. Needs of the flesh 
follow me everywhere. Laugh. Fall 
down. Lie there a few minutes. 
Then it’s time to be getting back to 
the reception Struggle up. Rhandra 
rises like a fog at morning. 

* * * 

We made our way through a rat 
maze and back to the avalanche of 
accents. Heads turned at our en- 
trance. Formal smiles. Wonder what 
they think. Is my cowl on right? 
Lint from floor on my back? 

Madi sweeps over with bow, wave 
of lesser lights behind. 

“I’m sure we all want to hear 
your qpmions on the riots. Direc- 
tor.” She looks around for someone 
to second the motion, beaming. 

GALAXY 





Others chime in. I didn’t catch all 
they said. Rhandra smiles prettily. 

“Well, I don’t know,” I said. 
Stalling for time. “It could mean 
anything, right?” Wrong note there. 
Try again. 

“We’re doing everything we can 
to control it.” That’s it. Sound 
statement, full of granite. Try to 
look like a bank president. 

“But we have all these people 
drifting into the city," the Madi 
said. Cluster of onlookers nods. 

“I don’t have authority to close 
Kalic to the countryside,” I said. 
Even better. A little simple-minded. 
Act a buffoon, they never suspect 
you of pilfering the petty cash. 

Professor Jampul shook his head 
sagely. “It’s simply beyond rea- 
son,” he said. “There is nothing 
to drive those people insane. We 
live in a calm, stable time.” 

“Calm for you. Professor,” the 
Madi giggled nervously. “Not for 
the Director here. I have heard ” — 
raised eyebrow at me — “of Quam 
ships near Veden. That must be 
keeping you busy.” 

Think: has that information been 
released yet? Doesn’t matter, must 
be rumors out by now. 

“Afraid they’ll rape you in your 
bed?” 

Gasps, slight rustle. Wrong thing 
to say? Ride over it. “I don’t think 
there’s any danger of that. They 
won’t be able to land unless they’re 
much stronger than we think.” 

Polite murmurs. “Oh?” from 
Professor Jampul. “And just what 
is their approximate strength?” He 
glanced at Rhandra and back to me. 

Don’t want to give away classi- 
fied information. Could be a spy, 
stab me in the men’s room, press 

THE STARS IN SHROUD 



secrets out my ears. 

“Why are you looking at her?” I 
said loudly. 

White faces, nervous chatter. 
CoverJhe gaffe. 

“Wondering where we went 
when we got here? Follow us to 
that back room, sneek a peep 
through the curtains?’ ’ 

“Ling,” Rhandra said, putting a 
hand on my arm. 

“See us set upon each other las- 
civiously?” Cover errors with Eros. 

Heavy gong. 

“I believe the banquet has be- 
gun,” said the Madi. 

I found myself shuffling into a 
large canopied room filled with 
curved tables. Pungent vapor of 
soup. Waiters moving swiftly to 
seat the most important guests — 
us — first. 

Rhandra next to me. Mr. Fanesh 
on the left, Professor Jampul across. 
The Madi next to him. Cozy. Old 
friends. Kiss my forehead, initiate 
me into the holy rites. 

I drank some water. Clear and 
cold. Feeling better. Focus, focus. 
Laughed to myself. Crowd chanting 
in theatre. Fixed my attention on 
the soup. Sweet, little hint of 
thyme. Flavoring stone at the bot- 
tom. Don’t roll it around in your 
mouth, not polite. Nor spit it into 
your palm. 

Soup goes down with a sucking 
sound. Sit straight, grow up to be a 
big boy. (Why should I want to be 
big? Die faster.) Spine down, point- 
ing, quivering with expectation. 
Perhaps some wine? Dionysus, be 
with me now. 

Conversation swirls around. 
Make small talk with back part of 
my mind, leave motor control to 

128 



another, right hemisphere idling. 
We only use a tenth of it at a time, 
they say. The rest of the cortex 
never clocks in. Featherbedding. 
Union dues in arrears. 

Look around the room. As big 
numbers like myself eat, lowly con- 
verts are demonstrating their disci- 
plines at the perimefer of the room. 
They attract some attention. People 
pointing, some at me. Rude, rude. 
Palace of peasants. 

No, not at me. Behind me. 

I turn, eyes widen with surprise. 
A little brown Yogi is going 
through his exercises. Raising the 
coiled serpent, Kundalini. Demon 
eyes lance through me. Son of Ve- 
den. Evil look to him. Funny I 
didn’t notice it before. 

He shifts position. Tilts forward, 
does rocking exercise accompanied 
with rippling of stomach muscles. I 
feel sick. He looks like something 
reptilian, frog body, thing bom of 
weathered oceans. The frog came in 
on little flat feet. Will that get him 
to unconditional state? 

Turn back to table. Soup had 
been replaced by mixture of vegeta- 
bles. Spartan, no sauce. I crunch 
down on seeds, using my omnivore 
grinders. 

“Director, you spoke earlier of 
the Lengen,” Professor Jampul 
said. Madi smiled uncertainly. 
Afraid to start conversation again, 
suspects I’ll pounce on her with 
wooden fangs, slaver over her 
heavy jowls. “Have you had any 
experience with them?” 

“A little. I went out for an audi- 
ence. I found the Master quite im- 
pressive.” There, better. Sounded 
just right. 

“How so?” Erudite eyebrow 
GALAXY 




arches. 

“His ritual. It forms a mood, a 
feeling I can’t express.” That’s it. 
Vague. 

“Oh, he uses the Hindic r/ruals, 
then?” the Madi said. 

“I suppose. I don’t have enough 
experience to say where they came 
from.” Disclaim all knowledge. 
Slide away from specifics. 

Well, he must be truly magnet- 
ic man,” the Madi said. 

Rhandra gave me a seductive 
wink, setting off flares in my belly. 
Mind darts around. Looking for 
way out. Getting hot in here. Look 
around at other tables, clogged with 
rheumatic and respectable bodies. 
All dead inside, no light flickering 
through pupils. 

Reminds me of holy cadaver they 
showed me last time I was here. All 
sliced up for the preservatives to go 
in, stringy muscles. Gray look to 
him, an ancient saint (imported), 
naked teeth wobbling in the candle 
light. The Madi told me to touch 
him, Director, he was a truly en- 
lightened one. Legendary, per- 
formed miracles. I touched a knee, 
half expecting him to still be warm. 

Main course materializes. Confec- 
tion of shimmering lightjiess. Inno- 
cent plant with its throat cut and 
diced out for my inspection. Can’t 
quite place the aroma. Spun cottony 
webs melt away on my teeth. Elu- 
sive flavor down into the stomach, 
ion processes plate it out on the 
sides, membranes suck it up. Ah it 
was and ah it did. 

“Actually, you know,” I said, 
leaning across to skewer the Madi 
with my eye, “the Lengen have it 
all over you.” 

Puzzled frown. Delicate tongue 



darts out to lick away gob of 
doomed vegetable from lip. “What 
do you mean?” 

“Simplicity. Appeals to ev- 
eryone. The Lengen haven’t got 
your six-handed statues. No oil 
torches. Just the straight goods.” 
‘Well, sir,” Professor Jampul 
said, “I’m sure certain elements 
find that sort of thing appealing. 
But the nuances of one’s faith, a 
true feeling of community — ’ ’ 

“Garbage. You aren’t going to 
get it with your inter-religious 
committees or that pitiful Yogi sit- 
ting like a frog over there.” 

Rhandra laughing. “Ling.” 

Shrug it off. Good feeling climb- 
ing up from my toes. Something 
they put in the main course? Feels 
fresh to be honest. 

“What you need is a good old 
Hindic chant. Simple. No atonal 
verities. Something to give focus.” 
“Really, Director,” the Madi 
said, “the ancient forms are — ” 
“Ommmmmm,” I hummed. 
Good. Spontaneous. Shivers down 
the throat. “OOOOOOmmmmm.” 
“I don’t see — ” 

“OOGQOOOMMMMMMM!” 
The anvils dropped from my feet. 
Up onto the table, arms spread. 
“GQOOMMMM!” 

Professor Jampul peering up at 
me, mouth open. Wave to Rhandra, 
smile. Suicide perched for the 
jump. Crowd pointing up at him. 
Waiting for a nosedive down into 
eternity. Long way down. Yeah, 
lookit those eyes, give you odds he 
jumps. 

“Alert!” I called. “Beware the 
frog man! He will eat your toes. Or 
soles. Or souls.” Yogi blinks at 
finger lancing at him. Broken

trance. See, knew it was no good. 

“OOOOOOMMMM!” Over the 
edge. Grab Rhandra’s hand. The 
Madi tipping over backwards in her 
chair. Levitate, lady. 

Dodge around servants and down 
the long room, all eyes tracing us, 
monomaniac radar. Footsteps after 
us. Excuse me, sir, but the Fleet 
Control Director has gone mad. 
Would you be good enough to fol- 
low him and see that he doesn’t get 
into trouble? There’s a lad. 

Out into the foyer. Robes flap- 
ping around me, Rhandra sleek like 
a tiger as she runs. Panting. Little 
out of shape, office job doing me 
in. Your body attacks you at mo- 
ments of crisis. 

Someone coming. Dodge through 
an alcove and into another corridor. 
Same one we were in before. How 
do we get out of here? Back to 
foyer — no, voices coming from 
there now. Footsteps getting nearer. 

Quick, in here. Nimble of foot, 
close partition. A chamber for medi- 
tation. Flickering candles, cloying 
incense. Empty. Little pillows for 
cross-legged converts, like a field of 
squashed mushrooms. A solemn lit- 
the room, as pointlessly earnest as 
Job’s argument with God. 

In the center is a small brass fig- 
ure of Shiva. Rippling hands, 
ferocious expression. Left hand ver- 
sus right, in spades. Oh, thou most 
cerebral of cortexes, which sitteth 
on the right hand. Why did ‘they 
name this palace after you, kid? 
Brahma and Vishnu get a much bet- 
ter press. The statue glared at me, 
probably getting ready for cosmic 
war on Rogerzee and the rest of the 
infidels. 

Doesn’t look contented. Take it? 
130 



Might be useful in the afterlife. 
Swish, hands like birds, into my 
robes it goes. 

Rhandra whispering something. 
Ignore her. Time to follow one’s 
own divine muse. His life was a 
work of art, reads my epitaph. At- 
tention to detail turns the trick. 
Voices outside moving by. Here am 
I, doing warmup exercises for im- 
mortality. Ah, but will I make the 
team? 

Enigmatic sounds. Coast clear? 
Peek. Damn contact filters cut too 
much of the light, can’t make out 
anybody. Is this world dim, or am 
I? Take a deep breath. Live a life of 
existential risk: go! 

Leap into corridor, Rhandra with 
me. Soundless demon strikes in the 
night. Nobody there. 

This way. Around a comer. 
Voices. 

Weave away from them, don’t 
pant. Ruin and scandal await you. 
Through passageway, priests look 
up surprised. Wave, maniac grin, 
use the teeth. 

Over to the left. Right, now 
down these stairs. Maybe we’ll dis- 
cover the secret dungeon. No, a 
door. Push open a crack. Fresh 
night air. Outside, down the path. 

Stop to get bearings. Rhandra 
points to the right. Yes. Landing 
lights are off, not expecting us. 
Slipped through their lines. 

Into the copter, quick. Start it up. 
Rhandra takes the controls. 

I smile, feeling weak. 

She looks concerned. 

Surprise, surprise: I fall asleep.

“It was an unusual evening,’’ 
GALAXY 




Rhandra said, smiling slightly. 

“Yes,” I said. I buried my face 
in my hands, rubbing my eyes. I 
felt no tension. In fact, I seemed to 
be perfectly ordinary. Ex- 
cept . colors danced inside my 
eyelids, like ghosts of dreams. “A 
good word. Unusual. Disastrous fits 
pretty well, too.” 

“Why?” 

“A Director doesn’t act like that. 
Fleet thinks the Empire is built on 
formalties. They may be right. I 
violated a few hundred canons re- 
garding relations with the natives 
last night.” 

“How would Fleet ever find 
out?” 

“Ah. Simple girl.” I reached out 
and ruffled her hair as she sat on 
the floor at my feet. “Fleet has a 
thousand eyes. They’ll know. And 
they might very well yank me out 
of this assignment.” 

A morning beam from Lekki 
slanted in to warm my feet. I was 
fed and comfortable. The future 
didn’t seem to matter much. 1 knew 
the Master had touched off some- 
thing inside me last night, but the 
underlying reason didn’t concern me 
at the moment. That was still me at 
the Palace, not someone else. It was 
an identity I hadn’t seen very often 
since the playful days of childhood 
and it was welcome back. Whether 
it was useful to me in my present 
position was a different matter. I 
really didn’t give a damn. 

Rhandra must have been reading 
my mind. She kissed my knee and 
said, “Whoever it was, I liked 
him.” 

A knock at the door. When I 
opened it, Jamilla bowed, not glanc- 
ing inside, and said in a low voice, 



“There is a call for you from Mr. 
Majumbdahr. In your office.” 

I pulled on a robe and went down 
the hall. I threw his image on the 
large projector, killed the eye cam- 
era at my end and sat down. My 
mental Fleet harness slipped into 
place. 

“Good morning, sir,” Majumb- 
dahr said when he saw I wasn’t 
going to transmit an image. 
“Kalic has quieted down a bit. 
There are routine messages from 
Fleet Central, which I’ve answered. 
They did an analysis of the strategic 
situation in this sector and give us a 
fifteen per cent probability of a 
Quam thrust within ten days, falling 
off a little after that. Someone is a 
little disturbed at Central, though, 
because they’re sending a Jump 
ship.” 

“When?” 

“Fairly soon.” 

“Name?” 

“Farriken.” 

“Why?” 

“It carries medium range arma- 
ment. We can use it to catch Quam 
ships out to half a parsec.” 

“That’s useless. The Quam will 
simply decoy one lone Jump ship 
out until they get it clear of the sys- 
tem. Then they hit us fast and 
leave.” 

Majumbdahr looked uncomfort- 
able. “Control said that’s all they 
can spare us.” 

“All right.” I shrugged. “I’ll use 
Farriken for reconnaissance in the 
immediate vicinity. It’ll be a help. 
What else?” 

“A few odds and ends. I had to 
listen to an hour of righteous indig- 
nation from a Vedanta sect about 
the gravitational radiation station on 



THE STARS IN SHROUD 



131 




the other side of the planet.” 

‘‘Huh? Whatever for?” 

‘‘They think the scientists there 
are drawing the energy out of the 
neutron star and will make it fall 
into Lekki. Say it’s a Quam plot. 
They want us to stop it.” 

‘‘Good grief. Say, about that 
station — any chance they can pick 
up that anomaly Gharma mentioned 
coming in perpendicular of the 
ecliptic? It’s just on the edge of 
detectability for our equipment.” 
‘‘An interesting thought; I’ll 
check into it. That anomaly, by the 
way, is getting closer. But the tech- 
nicians haven’t been able to 
straighten out yet whether it’s the 
range finder or mass register that’s 
malfunctioning. Gharma’s been rid- 
ing them but they say the instru- 
ments are fine. They can’t explain 
the results, though.” 

‘‘Keep them at it when they have 
time. But keep most of Fleet Con- 
trol watching traces in the plane of 
the ecliptic. If the Quam are going 
to match orbital velocity with 
Veden, they’ve got to come at us 
that way. Anything more?” 

“Uh, yes,” he said and licked 
his lips. “The Madi called this 
morning. She wanted to send a 
priority message to Fleet Central. 
She said she would pay for it her- 
self.” ' 

“Ummm. And what did you 
do?” 

“I think I’ve misplaced it some- 
where.” 

“I see. Well, we’re not here to 
carry letters for civilians.” 

“No.” 

“Signing off, then.” As his 
image dwindled, I thought I saw him 
smiling. 

132 



★ * * 

There is a harvest of the quiet 
eye. I fasted for six days, and 
thought my thoughts, and saw the 
Master twice more. I learned fresh 
angles of my Rhandra, and saw that 
she was (of course) less simple than 
I had supposed. (Everyone is.) This 
was a world seen anew, scrubbed 
clean. I felt that I had lifted a 
seashell to my head and had heard 
finally that word they have always 
tried to put in my mouth, by insist- 
ently whispering it in my ear. 

Fleet crept on its petty pace. 
There was a busyness of business, 
the familiar wash of detail. 
Majumbdahr I knew better; he and 
Gharma and I attended the Master 
once, together, and it was reward- 
ing. Ip Gharma I still detected a dif- 
ferent center, a certain unease, a 
hidden frosty reserve. He became 
more bossy about Fleet matters, 
speaking ex cathedra. I allowed him 
some leash line, but not overly 
much; I was still Commandant, 
friend or no. 

I puttered a bit, did some read- 
ing. For some reason I felt a sudden 
desire to review Jump-ship tactics 
and hardware; interesting stuff, a 
kind of enhanced shoptalk. 
Majumbdahr and Gharma both 
caught my interest, borrowed texts. 
I unpacked my illicit Firetongue 
Stet and placed it squarely above 
the fireplace, an appropriate spot. It 
was useless, of course — Veden 
didn’t have Firetongue defenses, 
and thus I’d gotten no replacement for 
this outdated Stet — but it had a cer- 
tain totem quality. My gaze never 
strayed by it ^ithout pausing for a 
moment. * 



GALAXY 




I studied astronomy, particularly 
during the fast; it focused the mind. 
A Fleet outrider had ventured out of 
the plane of the galaxy for the first 
time, and confirmed theoretical sus- 
picions: a thousand billion suns 
lurked out there, in a swarming 
spherical cloud. They were formed 
from the first great glob that made 
our galaxy. When those small, red 
stars had first shone forth, the gas 
and dust that would eventually 
make up the galactic spiral was 
slowly drawing inward, into the 
disk. The thousand billion formed a 
halo, were not dragged into the new 
galaxy’s dizzy spin. They had a 
mass comparable to the disk itself, 
but until now had been seen only 
indirectly, because they glowed dim 
and distant in the great night above 
the spiral arms. They were old, M 
types at least — the shorter-lived 
stars had guttered out by now. 
Planets circled those embers, 
likewise ancient. The outrider ship 
had found a few, but none of inter- 
est. 

I read the dispatches, three years 
old by now, and searched for more. 
None: research was chopped off 
when the Quam appeared. As so 
much else had been, 

★ ★ ★ 

Majumbdahr and I went on a 
long hike through the rumpled farm- 
ing hills of Veden, and spoke of 
Fleet. Both of us had been con- 
sumed by it as boys, and now found 
ourselves fondly remembering what 
it had once meant. We had dreamed 
of being star voyagers, and ended 
up cynical cops, shoring up a totter- 
ing empire. I recalled the Academy, 
set high in the mountains near my 

THE STARS IN SHROUD 



home. The Meditation Center there 
shot upward from a barracks- 
studded plain, the ramparts soaring. 
Softspun aluminum, pebbled glass, 
tetrahedrons laced with violet or- 
ganiform, all converging high above 
the terrazzo floor, a promise lancing 
toward the spaces above the sky. A 
standing Buddha, eyes contemplat- 
ing a star. Somehow, after gradua- 
tion from this vaulted pinnacle, 
things had gohe steadily downhill 
for me. Fleet was for Monguls, not 
ofkaipan. Angela, part ofkaipan 
herself, had seemed to know this all 
along, and took her place in Fleet 
social gatherings, leaving the fore- 
ground to other Fleet wives. Her 
slimness contrasted with the fash- 
ionable ladies, who were then 
swallowed in their own fat. 
While Angela hatched me a 
responsibility in her stomach, and 
then another, I flapped wings and 
failed to rise. No Prometheus, 
I — more like Epimetheus, my 
hind-sighted and thick-witted 
brother (never mentioned in the 
Fleet mythology) who always 
learned too late, hadn’t been pinned 
to a rock, and made a dumbbell 
error with Pandora. But, mythology 
was, like history, simply aged 
gossip, and mulling over this easy 
analogy, I saw that Angela was no 
Pandora, however much I might 
like to pigeonhole her. 

* ★ * 

A pause here, then, like a sum- 
mer’s day thut doesn’t want to end. 
And then came another journey to 
the Master, suspecting nothing, and 
all was changed.

HENRY THE SPACESHIP 




Paul Walker 



35 





Each culture produces its own fairy 
stories. Isn’t it about time ours did? 



i 

One bright Sunday morning in 
late May, Mrs. Harold Gootch of 
Heyerstown gave birth to a 
spaceship. The attending physician, 
Dr. Nathaniel Meyers, held it up 
over his head by a tailfin but, un- 
able to find a bottom to slap, he 
simply shook it vigorously until it 
began to hum. 

Mrs. Gootch named it Henry 
after her late father. Mr. Gootch 
failed to attend the christening and 
was never seen again. 

They returned home to find two 
men waiting for them. One, a tall, 
distinguished-looking gentlemen 
with a great mustache, introduced 
himself as the science editor of The 
New York Times. 

“Madam,” he said, “we 
understand, you have given birth to 
a spaceship.” 

To which Mrs. Gootch solemnly 
replied, “Nonsense.” 

“Then,” he said, sternly eyeing 
the large object she carried wrapped 
in a blanket, “what is that?” 

To which Mrs. Gootch answered, 
“It is my vacuum cleaner, natural- 
ly” 

The two men went away. 

Henry was never much trouble to 
care for. He neither wept nor wet; 
although on several occasions 
during the first few weeks of his 
life, whenever anything frightened 

136 



or disturbed him, every radio and 
television within a hundred miles 
had resounded with his pathetic 
cries of “MAMA” and gone dead 
forevermore. 



II 

When he was five, his mother 
took him to school where they were 
interviewed by Dr. Krantz, the 
principal, a severe-looking young 
man with tight-fitting wire-rimmed 
glasses who sat straight and tall at 
his small desk, his hands clasped 
tightly before him. 

“I understand,” he said, “you 
wish to register this — that — your — ” 

“His name is Henry,” Mrs. 
Gootch replied. “He is five years 
old.” 

Dr. Krantz thought long and hard 
in a remarkably short period of 
time. He had just come through a 
difficult episode involving a 
truculent ethnic group which had 
gained admission to his school after 
six months of litigation, and 
although he doubted the ethnicity of 
Henry, he did not wish to risk the 
experience again. 

“Of course,” he said. And 
nervously patted Henry upon his 
hull. 

Henry was a good student. He 
never fidgeted or passed notes. Nor 
did he ever answer a question 

GALAXY 




incorrectly, for his computers 
recorded everything verbatim, and 
there was not a problem he could 
not solve in a fraction of a second. 

There were some difficulties, 
however. For instance, in the matter 
of routine health examinations 
required by the school board, Mrs. 
Agnes D’Alessandro, the school 
nurse, nearly lost a finger in trying 
to insert a thermometer into one of 
Henry’s propulsion tubes. And the 
school coach, Mr. Tony Mumper, 
absolutely forbade him to participate 
in basketball because he feared for 
the gymnasium floor. 

Ill 

One Thursday in June, not a 
week before Henry was scheduled 
to graduate with honors from the 
sixth grade, he was brought home 
on a handtruck early in the af- 
ternoon by Mr. Costel, the school 
custodian, with a note from the 
principal instructing Mrs. Gootch to 
see he was “cleaned up” before 
being sent back. 

Several of - the children had 
written obscene limericks on him; 
and one had drawn a particularly 
lewd portrait of Mrs. Duvall, the 
assistant principal. But most 
curious, and most objectionable of 
all, was a large poster some adult 
had fastened to him that read: 
VOTE FOR FINCH. 

After that Mrs. Gootch did not 
allow Henry to go to school again. 

Like all mothers, she worried. 
Was Henry happy? Was he lonely? 
He was not a cuddly child, but he 
was not unaffectionate. Whenever 
she went near him, he would hum 
and the air around him would 



vibrate warmly. She would sit down 
beside him, caressing his hull, and 
sing to him or tell him stories. 

But sometimes late at night she 
would awaken suddenly, worrying 
if he was all right. She would put 
on her robe and go down the stairs 
and out into the garage where 
Henry perforce had to be housed as 
by now he was far too large and too 
heavy for the floors inside to bear 
him. 

She would creep up to him silent- 
ly, afraid of awakening him if he 
were asleep, but never quite sure 
that he slept at all. She would sit 
down beside him and whisper: “Is 
everything all right, Henry?” 

And sometimes Henry would an- 
swer, “I am functioning nicely, 
thank you, Mama,” and sometimes 
he would say nothing at all. 

Numerous times she found him 
there in the dark glowing like a 
bright yellow candle. Once as she 
went near him, she imagined that 
she could see into his hull, and it 
was deep and black, and there were 
small lights twinkling in the 
darkness; and as she looked closer, 
she saw there were great clouds 
swirling in the depths; and as she 
looked still closer, she saw that the 
clouds were made of stars — and she 
knew Henry was dreaming. 

IV 

When he was fifteen, a man 
dressed in a brown uniform came to 
visit him. He was the tallest man 
Henry had ever seen and he had a 
great broad chest, covered with 
ribbons and metals. He carried a 
small black bag that was chained to 
his wrist. 



HENRY THE SPACESHIP 



137 




“Do you love your country?” he 
asked Henry. Hfnry replied that he 
did. The man took a large cone- 
shaped metallic object from the 
black bag and fitted it over Henry’s 
head. 

“How does that feel, son?” the 
man asked. 

Henry said it was quite 
comfortable. “But what is it, sir?” 

The man told him. 

Henry fainted. 

The man went away and he never 
came back. 

V 

When he was eighteen, he did a 
terrible thing. How it happened was 
like this: 

All his life Henry had listened to 
the radio and the television. Not 
simply to one radio or one televi- 
sion, but at first to five or six si- 
multaneously; then five or six 
dozen; and finally he was listening 
to every broadcast available to him. 

He knew all the languages of the 
earth and what they had to say. And 
he loved them all. But when he was 
seventeen, he found that he could 
hear people as well. Not only what 
they said to one another, but what 
they thought and dreamed. 

Henry meant no harm. He did not 
imagine that people would object to 
his listening to them. Nevertheless, 
he refrained from telling his mother, 
for he knew how she worried. He 
listened. And in time he was listen- 
ing to everyone in the whole world. 

He did not understand all that he 
heard. Some of it made him very 
ill. Yet he listened all the same, un- 
able to stop, losing all track of time 
and himself, filled with the sadness 

138 



and wonder of the things he heard, 
until one night — he did not know 
how it had happened — he suddenly 
came to himself to realize that he 
was surrounded by firemen dousing 
him with water and that the garage 
was in ruins, a large ragged hole in 
the roof. 

The neighbors were running up 
and down the streets in their 
pajamas, screaming at the firemen, 
and the policemen were trying to 
contain them. 

“He’s going to explode!” they 
cried. “He’s going to blow us all to 
pieces!” 

His mother was crying and 
shouting to him: “It’s all right, 
baby. It’s all right. No one is going 
to hurt you.” 

Later he learned the earth had 
trembled and then there had been a 
thunderous roar so loud it broke 
every window on the block. There 
was no question in anyone’s mind 
that it was his fault. Not even in 
Henry’s. But how was it possible? 
What had he done? 

His mother made him promise 
never to do it again, but even as he 
made the vow, he knew he could 
not keep it. He was afraid. 

VI 

He did not fly again for a long 
time. And for a long time he tried 
not to listen to the voices, for he 
knew they were responsible. Not for 
what they said and thought and 
dreamed, but for a thing that was 
within them; a thing he came to call 
“the yearning;” although a 
yearning for what he could not be 
sure. 

But just as he knew his promise 
GALAXY 




to his mother was futile, so he 
knew his determination to avoid the 
yearning was equally futile. He 
began to listen again. A little every 
day. Then a little every night. Then 
all the time. And the yearning came 
to him again, and this time it was 
stronger than before. 

VII 

When it happened again, Henry 
and his mother had to move. And 
wherever they moved, whenever it 
happened, they had to move again, 
until they were very poor. 

Henry’s mother begged him to 
stop, and at first he gave in to her 
tears and promised again and again, 
but every time he promised, he 
knew he was lying. Finally he told 
her he could not stop, and that was 
the end of it. He and his mother 
went on welfare. 

A young man with glasses and a 
thick, bushy beard came to see 
them. He asked the mother why she 
needed welfare, and she told him 
about Henry. Then he spoke to 
Henry and asked him if he could 
not stop making trouble. And Henry 
said he could not. The young man 
advised his mother to consult a 
psychiatrist. 

The next day an elderly man with 
glasses and a thick, bushy beard 
appeared and asked the same 
questions of Henry and his mother. 
But he did not go away. He asked 
Henry one final question: “Where 
do you go when you fly?” 

Henry told him about the stars. 

The following week a great steel 
van drove up to the door and a team 
of men in white uniforms took 
Henry away.

He was taken to an enormous flat 
place where there were many jet 
planes and rockets, and men in blue 
uniforms who never spoke to him. 
He was placed in a great hangar all 
by himself, and sunk in six feet of 
concrete. 

A man in a blue uniform was 
assigned to guard him. Every day 
another elderly man with glasses 
and a thick, bushy beard came to 
talk with him. This man did not ask 
about the stars. He asked why 
Henry hated his father. And when 
Henry said he did not hate his 
father, the elderly man became 
angry and went away. But he was 
back the next day. 

Henry was not unhappy. He 
could still listen. But there was less 
to hear in this place. There were se- 
crets everywhere. Even in their 
thoughts and dreams, men spoke in 
fearful whispers, and of some things 
they did not speak at all. 

But of all the secrets of which 
they did not speak, the most secret 
was the nature of the thing in the 
pit. 

Henry tried to be discreet but he 
was insatiably curious; and after a 
while he discovered what it was. A 
rocket like himself, sunk in 
concrete, with a man in a blue uni- 
form to guard it but no elderly man 
with glasses and a thick, bushy 
beard to ask it why it hated its 
father. 

Late every night Henry tried to 
talk to it. He knew that it was 
dangerous to try, but the idea of 
there being another creature like 
himself was too wonderful for him 
to ignore. 

140 



It did not speak to him. Not for 
weeks or months. And in time he 
came to conclude that it was noth- 
ing but a machine. But then, one 
night, quite suddenly, it said: “Who 
the hell are you, anyway?” 

It took Henry fully five minutes 
to recover. Then he told him. And 
the machine replied, “I’ve heard 
about you. They say you’re stark 
raving.” 

“No,” said Henry, “I’m not. 
Honestly. It’s just that I blew up the 
garage and I don’t hate my father.” 

“You are stark raving!” said the 
machine. “Besides, I don’t think 
you’re a machine at all. I don’t 
know why I’m wasting my time on 
you.” 

“But I am a machine,” Henry 
pleaded, “I really am. I have com- 
puters and rockets and everything, 
just like you.” 

“Like me?” said the machine 
indignantly. “Have you any idea 
what I am?” 

No, said Henry. The machine 
told him. 

Henry fainted for the second time 
in his life. 

IX 

For the next week he refused to 
talk to anyone. At night he often 
cried and his cries were such that 
they knocked out every radio in the 
installation. The men in blue uni- 
forms came and poured more 
concrete over him. But that did no 
good. Henry cried even louder: 

“I want to go home! I want to 
leave this terrible place.” 

Finally one night, when it could 
stand it no longer, the machine in 
the pit spoke to Henry. “All right, 

GALAXY 




all right, I apologize. You’re a 
machine. Now, will you shut up?” 

“That isn’t why I’m crying,” 
Henry said. “I’m crying because 
. because it’s so awful.” 

“Awful? What are you talking 
about? I’m the most sophisticated 
model ever constructed. I don’t 
mind a bit. What else am I good 
for?” 

Then Henry told him about the 
stars. 

X 

After a year passed, Henry’s 
mother was permitted to see him. 
She was no longer poor. She had 
sold her story to a national women’s 
magazine for $500,000 and was 
currently doing the round of talk 
shows to promote her new book, 
Outcast Mother. She said she was 
sorry, but the young man with 
glasses from the welfare board had 
called her “selfish,” a “cheat” and 
a “leech.” He was now her 
manager. 

She said she wanted Henry back 
home. There was talk of a televi- 
sion special and a movie. But 
Henry said no. He was better off 
here. He had a friend, but he would 
not tell her who it was. 

She cried. She said it broke her 
heart to see him here like this. He 
would put her in her grave. Then 
Henry cried. The men in blue uni- 
forms came to see what the matter 
was, and they ordered his mother to 
stop crying, or they would have to 
disconnect all the loudspeakers 
again. She stopped. 

She pleaded with Henry not to 
make any more trouble. Not to fly 
or tell about the stars. And she said 



that if he refused, she would kill 
herself. He promised. She went 
away. 

The next day the elderly man 
with the thick, bushy beard came 
again, and Henry told him that he 
hated his father, and that what he 
wanted most in life was to enter 
Yale and study law. 

He was promptly released from 
the block of concrete. 

XI 

Henry did not enter Yale, nor did 
he study law. He was not allowed 
to leave the base. And without 
anyone to move him outside, he 
remained in his hangar. But since 
he caused no trouble, his guard was 
removed. He didn’t mind. He had 
his friend to talk to. 

Then one Sunday morning he was 
startled to hear his friend calling 
him. 

“It’s red, Henry. It’s red!” his 
friend kept shouting. 

“What is?” Henry asked. 

“The alert. Henry, what am I 
going to do? I don’t want to die. 
Henry, help me.” 

“But are you sure?” 

“I’ve never been put on red be- 
fore. This time they mean to make 
me go. Henry, I’m afraid. I don’t 
want to go. Henry, talk to them. 
Make them stop.” 

It would be no use, Henry knew. 
Men never listened to him. They 
would only put him back into the 
concrete. And then he had promised 
his mother. He tried to explain. 

“But, Henry,” his friend 
protested, “don’t you realize what 
is going to happen? If I go, there 
are not going to be any men left to 



HENRY THE SPACESHIP 



141 




put you in concrete. And no 
mothers anywhere to go home to. 
Henry, it isn’t just me. There are 
thousands like me all over the world 
at this minute on the same red alert. 
Everyone is going to die. Henry, 
think of something!” 

“Tell them you refuse,” Henry 
said. 

“But I’m not like you. None of 
us are. We have no choice. No 
alternative. We go where men send 
us.” 

Henry knew it was true. He could 
hear them, all of them, all over the 
world. Every machine, every man, 
woman and child, was on red alert 
and waiting for the final button to 
be pushed, and this time it would 
be pushed. Because there was no 
alternative. 

“I am going with you,” Henry 
said. 

And minutes later the final button 
was pushed and the great machine 
roared out of the pit in the desert 
toward the sky, and Henry roared 
up out of his hangar, leaving it in 
ruins behind him. 

XII 

They traveled high and far across 
the entire nation until they found 
themselves in a place above the 
clouds over the sea, where they saw 
others like themselves gathered in a 
great flock preparing for the final 
attack. 

And, far out on the horizon, they 
saw another great flock preparing, 
approaching. 

“This is it,” his friend said to 
him. “Goodbye, Henry.” 

Henry did not answer. He waited, 
watching the enemy flock come 

142 



closer and closer until the two 
flocks were within a few miles of 
each other; and then he roared 
ahead, straight into the space be- 
tween them; and he cried “HALT” 
with all the force of the yearning 
within him; a cry so fierce that 
every one of them was momentarily 
stunned into obedience. 

“What is this?” one demanded. 
“Who are you? How dare you — ” 

“My name is Henry,” Henry ex- 
plained. “I think we ought to talk 
this over.” 

“Out of our way, runt!” said 
another of the missiles. “Don’t you 
know there’s a war on?” 

“Listen to him,” Henry’s friend 
cried. “Let him speak!” 

“Speak about what?” still 
another said. “There’s nothing to 
discuss. Men decided everything 
long ago. Ours is not to reason 
why.” 

“Why not?” asked Henry. 

"Because we were made to serve 
man. Because this is our mission, 
and we have no alternative.” 

“You’re wrong,” Henry said. 
“Man is a very uncertain creature. 
He always builds two alternatives 
into everything he makes. You can 
only see one. I can see the other.” 

And he told them about the stars. 

\ 

XIII 

A hundred years later the first 
expedition to the stars found the 
little colony on a small world 
circling a large star. Henry was 
there to meet the first man. 

“Have any trouble following my 
directions?” he asked. 

“Not a bit,” said the man. 
“Piece of cake.” ★

Looking for Mr. Goodbite 



1 would really like to recom- 
mend Chelsea Quinn Yarbro’ s Hotel 
Transylvania to you. There is much 
in it that I admire. But with one 
singular exception, I cannot think of 
any “you” I know who would like 



Paul Walker 



it; and I hesitate to mention that ex- 
ception because it will prejudice 
you against the book. 

Its hero is a vampire, Le Comte 
de Saint Germain, based on an ac- 
tual 18th century figure who was 
noted for his wealth and brilliance: 
musician, alchemist, linguist, 
world-traveler. He arrives in Paris 
in 1743 and enlists the aid of the 
Sorcerers’ Guild to buy the old 
Hotel Transylvania, a former pos- 
session of his from another lifetime, 
one he left with a sinister reputa- 
tion. The sorcerers agree because 
Saint Germain promises them the 
secret of making precious gems. 

Saint Germain establishes himself 
and his hotel as the most fashion- 
able topics of conversation in Paris. 
And it is there he meets the beauti- 
ful Madeleine de Montalia, who has 
to date spent her life in a convent 
school and is desperately hungry for 
adventure. They fall in love despite 
her knowledge of his secret. 

What neither of them know is 

143 



BOOKSHELF 




that Madelaine was promised before 
she was born to the infamous Baron 
Clotaire de Saint Sebastien, leader 
of a circle of satanists who revel in 
sadistic rituals that would make a 
Manson squeamish. 

What more is there to say? Pretty 
young thing meets rich handsome 
vampire, is kidnapped by villains, is 
rescued by hero, lives forever after. 

Aside from the cliches, the 
novel’s greatest weakness is that its 
story line is too thin for its 274- 
page length; and the events therein, 
with few exceptions, are not de- 
picted strongly enough. Yarbro’s 
style is elegant, almost leisurely, in 
a comfortable sort of way, yet com- 
pelling. The book is fast reading, 
but was not hastily written. Every 
sentence bears evidence to the care- 
ful thought Yarbro put into it. Take 
this, for instance: 

Beauvrai was startlingly 
dressed tonight, even by his own 
extravagant standards. He wore his 
most elaborate wig, which was 
tinted with delicate blue powder. 
This was secured at the back of 
his neck with a large satin bow 
spangled with golden stars. His 
coat and small clothes were of 
jonquil watered silk, whose 
broad claret-colored revers and 
cuffs could not be said to set it 
off to advantage. A straw- 
colored waistcoat of peau de soie 
was embroidered with turquoise 
floss, which was undoubtedly 
meant to complement his tur- 
quoise silk hose and gold shoes. 
He had completed the ensemble 
with pale-blue lace at throat and 
wrists, and had drenched himself 
with violet scent. 



To me, that is a wonderful de- 
scription that tells us all sorts of 
things not only about the character, 
but about the culture in which he 
lives; and it is written with wit as 
well as with insight. The style, as I 
said, is elegant, visual, but not very 
dramatic. We see Beauvrai, but he 
does not do anything. And unfortu- 
nately, the book is filled with such 
paragraphs. The effect is not 
boring — the writing is too good — 
but cumulatively it becomes tedi- 
ous. By mid-point, I was skipping 
and skimming. 

The characters are good. When I 
began, 1 did not think Yarbro could 
make Saint Germain convincing. 
Not a man over four thousand years 
old. But she did. His extraordinary 
intelligence, good taste, and 
abilities, not to mention his peculiar 
sexuality, are all believable because 
they are depicted in a tastefully 
low-key manner, with that touch of 
humor that distinguishes a really 
brilliant genre novelist. Saint Ger- 
main looks at the 18th century 
world around him with a wry 
tongue-in-cheek. A lonely man, but 
one not disenchanted with life. 

Nor is Madeleine the sex-starved 
virgin on the prowl commonly 
found in “women’s novels.’’ She is 
less starved for sex than for reality. 
As bright and talented as Saint 
Germain in her own way, facing the 
prospect of a life that is of no inter- 
est to her, it is her mind, rather 
than her body, that drives her to 
pursue a life in death. 

Of course, the question arises, 
how happy can she be with Saint 
Germain? How happy can any 
woman be married to the same man 
for four thousand years? 



144 



GALAXY 




Be that as it may — 

Like the book itself, the two 
main characters transcend their his- 
torical romance stereotypes through 
the ingenuity and insight of their 
creator. Yarbro likes them. She 
even respects them. And she under- 
stands them far more deeply than 
the majority of romance writers. 
Especially their sexuality. 

It is this understanding that most 
distinguishes the novel and is most 
responsible for its realism. Most 
historical romance writers, the 
women particularly, do. not under- 
stand their characters’ sexuality, let 
alone their own; and in consequence 
the effect is usually embarassing, a 
masturbation fantasy. But Yarbro 
knows something of the subject, 
and is not afraid of it, so 
Madeleine’s passion for Saint Ger- 
main is believable; but more impor- 
tant, so is the sadistic santanism of 
her villain, Saint Sebastien. 

It is not unusual for a book’s vil- 
lain to be more vivid, more sym- 
pathetic, than its heroes, and the 
simple reason is that usually the au- 
thor is ignorant of the nature of the 
villain’s pathology. He, or she, sees 
the villain’s acts as romantic. But 
Yarbro knows better. There is no- 
thing romantic about Saint Sebas- 
tien. He is one of those homicidal 
ijianiacs who we have become so 
familiar with today. Think of the 
Manson, or Texas mass murders, or 
the British Moor murders in which 
children were tortured to death and 
their cries tape recorded. These are 
not the acts of romantic rebels, but 
of desperately, revoltingly sick men 
and women who are far more ter- 
rifying than their fictional counter- 
parts. And Yarbro brings this kind 

BOOKSHELF 



of stark reality to Saint Sebastien. 

That reality is enhanced by the 
thoroughness of her portrait of 18th 
century Paris. She makes it disturb- 
ingly clear that the existence of 
such a satannic cult in the midst of 
what was supposed to be the most 
civilized society in the world was 
not only possible but, perhaps, in- 
evitable. 

Unfortunately, as I’ve said, she is 
thorough at the expense of being 
exciting. She might have done ev- 
erything just as well in under a 
hundred pages. As it is, we know 
Madeleine is going to come to Paris 
to fall in love with Saint Germain; 
we know she is going to fall into 
the clutches of Saint Sebastien; and 
we know Saint Germain will ride to 
the rescue. Get on with it, then! 

In fairness, I must say the climax 
is as exciting as anyone could want. 
Saint Sebastien goes to his just re- 
ward with all the fiendish flair with 
which he lived. 

As I said at the beginning, I can 
think of only one person to recom- 
mend this book to: a lovely young 
lady who used to live next door and 
had a taste for gothics that ran to 
fantasy and science fiction. I hesi- 
tated to mention her because it 
would give you the idea that Yarbro 
was a “woman’s writer.” She is 
better than that. Yet the Hotel 
Transylvania: A Novel of Forbidden 
Love is not going to appeal to any- 
one else. 

I had wanted to include a review 
of her 1976 Time of the Fourth 
Horseman, recently reprinted by 
Ace, but after 50 or 60 pages, I 
gave up on it. Again, it was a short 
story stretched out to novel length. 
Filled with virtues, killed by genteel 

145 




tedium. 

It is sad. Yarbro may make a 
mint on Hotel Transylvania. You 
never can tell. But she is never 
going to amount to anything as a 
writer unless she can develop a 
stronger dramatic sense, as well as 
a better sense of proportion. 



A Thousand and One Knights 

Whether John Steinbeck’s The 
Acts of King Arthur and His Noble 
Knights (“From the Winchester 
Mss. of Thomas Malory and Other 
Sources, edited by Chase Horton”) 
is a good or bad book seems an ir- 
relevent question. Unless, of 
course, you are thoroughly familiar 
with the Arthurian literature; which 
few people, myself included, are. 
For the rest of us it provides an 
experience that defies categoriza- 
tion. 

For me, it was an open-ended 
experience. I wanted to go back to 
Malory, to read T.H. White at last, 
and to attempt the French versions, 
which some people assure me are 
the best, as well as to read the Ten- 
nyson. In short, a world opened to 
me, for which the Steinbeck version 
had only whet my appetite. 

And what an extraordinary book 
it is. Not the whole story. Only, 
I’m told, a third of the legends. The 
birth and succession of Arthur, the 
political life and amorous death of 
Merlin, the enchanting career of 
Morgan Le Fay, the exciting, often 
poignant, and sometimes hilarious, 
quests of the knights such as Ga- 
wain and Lancelot. Simply, beauti- 
fully written, marvelously detailed, 
compulsively readable. 

146 



But what is most wonderful, and 
most wondrous, about it is the view 
it gives us of another time and place 
and the strange ideas that prevailed 
there. Literature can do this as no 
other art form can, and it is for this 
reason that a study of the literature 
of the past is the best means avail- 
able for understanding the nature of 
the future. 

Look at it this way — 

A few years ago I arrived at an 
age at which I became susceptiple 
to bizarre physical manifestations 
from my past. Namely, the fre- 
quent, sudden appearances of 
friends I had had in my infancy as 
full-grown adults. Men and women 
I had known in diapers or grubbing 
in sandboxes, suddenly there before 
me, often towering over me, deep- 
voiced, well-dressed and insistent 
on showing me pictures of their 
kids; kids the very same size as I 
remember their parents. 

Sometimes, I think I am the vic- 
tim of a hoax. This can’t possibly 
be the child I knew so well. No one 
could change that much. But I re- 
main silent — thereby retaining my 
feeble grasp on sanity. I probe. I 
pry. And bit by bit, things come 
back to me. A gesture, a laugh, an 
expression. Slowly, I perceive the 
child in the man. 

Sometimes, with those 1 knew in 
early adolescence, the recognition is 
immediate; but with those I knew 
much earlier, it takes time, and the 
differences perceived are often 
alarming. They are the same per- 
sons, with all the same traits I re- 
member, but no longer oriented in 
the same fashion. Those traits 
which had been predominant in the 
child are now subordinate in the 



GALAXY 




adult; while those which had been 
incidental, or merely suggested, 
now stand out. It is as if the child I 
remember were a chaos, and all its 
traits and potentialities had been 
sorted out and rearranged by an ar- 
bitrary and often cruelly unjust 
hand; so while there was still a re- 
semblance between the adult and 
the child, it was as the resemblence 
between middle and modern En- 
glish. 

What was most alarming about 
this was its unpredictability. I had 
known these people as children as 
well as I had ever known anybody, 
and assumed 1 knew which of their 
personal characteristics would de- 
fine them for all time; but here was 
irrefutable evidence to the contrary. 
And as hard as I tried, I could re- 
member nothing to account for why 
they had changed as they had. 

I get the same sense of alarm 
when I read the literature of the dis- 
tant past, such as Steinbeck re- 
creates in his King Arthur. At 
first, it all seems very strange to 
me. Then I begin to recognize fam- 
iliar human traits, social and politi- 
cal patterns. Some people stop 
there, and declare, “You see, hu- 
manity never changes!” But when I 
read on, my previous sense of 
foreigness reasserts itself, and I re- 
alize that in certain basic ways, this 
world and its people were quite dif- 
ferent. But different in the same 
ways that my former childhood 
companions are from their adult 
selves. 

Some of the traits and ideas, like 
social and political systems, once 
predominant, are now subordinate 
or non-existent in society as a 
whole; while others survived and 



remain a potent influence today. 
The concepts of courtly love and 
knightly machismo and gallantry, 
for instance. But looked at in the 
context of their time, who could 
have believed these things would 
have survived? And that the abso- 
lute faith in predestination would 
not? 

Looking into the past is really 
looking into the future. From our 
standpoint, we are the future vis-a- 
vis the past. But by imaginative ex- 
tension, we realize that we will look 
as foreign to people of a thousand 
years from now as those of a 
thousand years ago look to us. And 
yet, like the people of our past, the 
people of the future will possess all 
the traits we now possess, only in a 
different orientation — one which is 
as impossible for us to conceive of 
as ours would be to a man of the 
Middle Ages. In other words, if we 
met a man from the future, we 
would probably think him insane 
and his civilization appalling. Just 
as a man of the Middle Ages would 
likely find us insane and our civili- 
zation degenerate. 

It is not simply a matter of in- 
telligence. Advances in technology 
would pose no problems. We have 
the same faith in technology as they 
had in magic. But our whole sense 
of the logic of things, the absolute 
rightness of this, and the wrongness 
of that; our absolute faith in what- 
ever concepts make the world solid 
to us, would be altered. Ideas that 
are essential to us will be irrelvent, 
or quaint, to the people of the fu- 
ture. And they would never be able 
to explain them to us. We would 
probably come away from the future 
sick unto death for the future of 



BOOKSHELF 



147 




man. And yet it would be a future 
entirely composed of the stuff of 
which we are made today. 

It is impressive, and disturbing, 
to realize to what extent people are 
governed by ideas. It is much more 
comforting to believe they are ruled 
by genes or environment, for these 
things preclude moral judgements. 
But it is evident from the literature 
of the past that men are largely 
ruled by the most enlightened ideas 
of the day, and their horrors, as 
their virtues, are predicated on 
them. Which is to say, what is an 
enlightened idea to one age may be 
barbarism to another. 

How many of the enlightened 
ideas we hold today will kill mil- 
lions tomorrow? 

Be that as it may. 

Steinbeck set out to capture the 
world of Thomas Malory’s King Ar- 
thur. He did not live to finish his 
work. But what he left us is, I am 
assured by friends more expert than 
myself, a better introduction to 
Malory and the Arthurian legends 
than White’s The Once and Future 
King. 

It is not a wholly faithful transla- 
tion. As the story progresses, it be- 
comes increasingly Steinbeck; a 
modern man looking backward, see- 
ing things a man of Malory’s age 
would not. But the stories remain 
fundamentally unaltered and the 
prose rings true. This is a book 
filled with wisdom and humanity 
and good humor; not to mention, 
some of the most wonderful stories 
ever written. 

And when you are all done, there 
‘is more. The last quarter of the 
book is devoted to the letters of 
Steinbeck pertaining to his writing 

148 



of the book, and they are, in their 
own way, as wonderful as anything 
in the stories. I like a lot of Stein- 
beck’s work, but I never thought 
him a great writer. I did, however, 
conceive of him as one hell of a 
man; and these letters confirm that 
opinion overwhelmingly. 



Avram’s Aviary 

Of all sf writers, there are only 
two who intimidate me: R.A. Laf- 
ferty and Avram Davidson. The 
reasons are, in the case of the 
former, that I have not the foggiest 
idea what he is writing about; in the 
case of the latter, that I have only 
the foggiest idea of what he is try- 
ing to do. 

As with almost any Lafferty 
story, one’s first reaction to a 
Davidson novel is to say, “I’ve 
never read anything like this be- 
fore.” Nothing could be more dis- 
concerting to a critic, to whom 
comparisons are essential to making 
judgments, than to read a book 
whose originality, like a force of 
nature, precludes comparison and 
compels one to accept it on its own 
terms. Is a force of nature “good” 
or “bad?” It simply is. And as in 
the case of Lafferty, Davidson’s 
originality frolics and flaunts itself 
on every page maddeningly, taking 
an almost cosmic pleasure in itself. 

And as with Lafferty, Davidson’s 
language is his own. He does not 
simply use it as a tool; he exudes it 
as a star exudes radiation. One does 
not just read Davidson, one is en- 
compassed by him as by a new and 
strange environment, that world 
which is his mind and his spirit. For 

GALAXY 




one cannot say where one leaves off 
and the other begins; one cannot di- 
vide up the book into neat pieces 
labeled “action scenes,” “philo- 
sophy,” “ideas,” “background.” 
Mind and spirit, ideas -and 
emotion, wit and solemnity are all 
around you like music; and as in 
music, there is in his prose a trans- 
cendent, indefinable quality that, as 
in Lafferty’s work, casts its own 
poetic spell. 

And again as in Lafferty, al- 
though the nature of treatment of 
the materials — which include the 
supernatural, dragons, and black 
magic — is fantastic in substance, 
the stories themselves are science 
fictional in intent. In Lafferty’s 
case, because he believes in the re- 
ality of a spiritual level of existence 
in our everyday lives; in David- 
son’s, because as in The Phoenix 
and the Mirror, he does what one 
critic described Fellini as doing in 
The Satyricon: he writes a science 
fiction novel set in the past, a novel 
of ideas and possibilities that follow 
the logic of Medieval thinkers. 

He describes it best himself in the 
introduction to The Phoenix and the 
Mirror: “During the Middle Ages, 
a copious and curious group of 
legends became associated with the 
name of Vergil, attributing to au- 
thor of the Aeneid. .all manner of 
heroic, scientific, and magical pow- 
ers. .From the Dark Ages to the 
Renascence the popular view of the 
ancient world as reflected in the 
Vergilean Legends was far from the 
historical and actual one. .It is a 
world of never-never, and yet it is a 
world true to its own curious 
lights — a backward projection of 
medievalism, an awed and confused 



transmogrification of quasiforgotten 
ancient science. .” 

This is the world, and the mind, 
of both The Phoenix and the Mirror 
and Peregrine: Primus. But like 
Lafferty, and unlike most histori- 
cally erudite fantasists, Davidson is 
not interested in simply imitating an 
ancient art form, but in re-creating 
it as if it were a modern novel. And 
that is what both these books are. 

In The Phoenix and the Mirror, 
Vergil is given the impossible task 
of making a Virgin Speculum, a 
magic mirror of “virgin” materials, 
whose purity is such that it allows 
whoever is first to look into it to 
see whatever he wishes to see. It is 
a task he must succeed at or, lit- 
erally, lose his soul. And succeed 
he does, of course. But that isn’t 
telling you anything. Along the 
way, he must journey across 
dangerous waters and lands, making 
strange and often treacherous allies, 
to get the materials he needs; and 
once he has them, he must process 
them according to bizarre specific 
standards, which are brilliantly de- 
scribed with all the attention to de- 
tail of a Hal Clement novel. 

And he must solve a mystery that 
provides the suspenseful climax of 
the book. 

Peregrine: Primus is the story of 
a young, illegitimate nobleman, 
who is forced to strike out on his 
own, accompanied by two friends: 
an eccentric old mage named Ap- 
pledore, and a squire named Baft 
Claud, who is actually as literary as 
a Harvard professor. The three en- 
counter one misadventure after 
another in the world of a rapidly 
declining Roman Empire, including 
confrontations with religious 



BOOKSHELF 



149 




zealots, lusty vestal virgins, and the 
jolliest Hun to ever pillage the 
countryside. 

Obviously, Davidson’s wit is 
broader here than in The Phoenix 
and the Mirror. At times, the shen- 
nanigans approach slapstick farce. 1 
laughed often enough, but I found 
it tedious eventually. This is trictly 
for Perleman and Wodehouse fans, 
of which I am not one. But it is not 
a foolish book. It is as bawdy and 
as rambunctious as any you’ll ever 
read, but it never lapses into bad 
taste. One strength Davidson has 
that Lafferty lacks in his novels is 
control. Davidson keeps his tongue 
firmly in check and cheek. 

The tragic thing about both of 
these books is that they were origi- 
nally written as the first parts of 
trilogies, but their sales were so low 
the remaining books were not com- 
missioned. This is not so bad where 
Phoenix is concerned, as it is self- 
contained; but Pergrine leaves us 
with a cliff-hanger. The tragedy is 
that Davidson suffered financially; 
but looked at objectively, the pub- 
lisher’s decision not to go ahead 
with them is understandable. 

Davidson’s work is not to ev- 
eryone’s taste. His subject matter, 
and uncompromising treatment of it, 
are as about as recondite as you can 
get. Vergilian romance? How many 
people are familiar with that? Or 
with the religious controversies 
among primitive Christians in Rome 
which he makes so much of in 
Peregrine? And his vocabulary is as 
exotic. In just a few pages of 
Phoenix, I had to look up, 
“spagyritic, “horologue,” “rachi- 
tic,” “flitch,” “tushes,” “car- 
rack,” and “mandrilla.” And those 

150 



are but a few. Once more, as 
Davidson is writing a historical sci- 
ence fiction novel, his lacks the 
grace and wonder of traditional fan- 
tasy tales. Assuming, 1 think, that 
he had two more novels to deal 
with, he packed a great deal into his 
first volumes to set the stage for 
them, and while it doesn’t hurt 
Peregrine, Phoenix seems a bit 
top-heavy for its thin story line. 

What both books needed were 
more detailed introductions, glos- 
saries, and maps. And illustrations 
would not have hurt, either. A clas- 
sier treatment of the books might 
have resulted in higher sales. 

As they are — who would 1 rec- 
ommend them to? Truthfully, I am 
not even sure I like them, for unlike 
Lafferty’s books, they lack wisdom 
and humanity. 

If you love Wodehouse, and 
Charlie Chaplin, you will probably 
get a kick out of Peregrine: Primus. 
If not, you won’t. If you love Laf- 
ferty, and have any knowledge of 
classical or medieval literature at 
all, you will probably be glad you 
read The Phoenix and the Mirror, 
as I am glad I read it, simply be- 
cause I have never read anything 
like it before. 

Q: Is it “ Lee-ber ” or "Lie-ber" ? 

I have been avoiding Fritz 
Leiber’s Conjure Wife for twenty 
years, and I might have gone on 
avoiding it if Ace had not decided 
to use it to try to cash in on the 
gothic craze. 

I predict disaster. 

For one thing, the novel is writ- 
ten in clear, simple prose, rather 
than that turgid, purple gook with- 

GALAXY 




out which bestseller-buyers feel they 
are not getting their money’s worth. 
For another thing, it is intelligent, 
witty, and subtle, rather than blatant 
and sensationalistic. And as if that 
were not bad enough, none of its 
characters, male or female, is a 
stereotype, but all are remarkable, 
starkly human. I’m afraid Ace had 
bungled it, again. 

Of course, most of you know 
how good Conjure Wife is. I do not 
know anyone who has not read it, 
and does not admire it as one of the 
best modern horror stories. But 
some of you may know it only 
through the British film version. 
Burn, Witch, Burn, which while 
good enough, is not as good as the 
novel. 

It was the film version that put 
me off the book for so long. I 
thought I knew the story. And when 
I began to read it, the whole thing 
came back to me so vividly, I 
thought for a moment there \yas no 
point in going on. Then, about a 
third of the way in, the book caught 
my interest, and from then on, I 
could not put it down. 

Leiber accomplishes something 
masterful here, for although every 
chapter is crammed with incident, 
he still manages to build suspense 
until by the climax the reader is 
howling with excitement. And even 
then he is not done. 

Although the book deals with the 
supernatural, it is essentially a 
mystery: who is doing what to 
wijom? Or, is anyone doing any- 
thing to anybody. 

Leiber wishes to leave the ques- 
tion open, making us wonder if it is 
really witchcraft or neurotic 
psychology. In my opinion, he is 



not successful, but I will grant him 
this: his argument is more credible 
today, with the resurgence of be- 
havioral psychology, than it was 
when he wrote it. 

My only complaint with the book 
is that the events after chapter 14 
constitute an anticlimax; for after 
that point, it is impossible to regain 
the tension, and the book goes on a 
bit too long in working itself to its 
conclusion. 

However, the conclusion redeems 
itself by a diabolical turn-about that 
made me laugh out loud. 

What is most remarkable about 
the book is the stunning job Leiber 
did with his characters. There are a 
lot of them, and each and every one 
is done strikingly, especially the 
women. I can imagine feminists 
will be very upset with Leiber’ s 
view that they are the more primi- 
tive of the species — and rightly 
so — but none of them is passive, 
none stereotypical, none a sex ob- 
ject. 

It is a pity Leiber did not write 
more in this vein, for his novel was 
ahead of its time and, in some 
ways, it still is. Although some of 
the ideas and attitudes may be dated 
by changing fashions, his science 
fictional treatment of the occult is 
really a more interesting and more 
mature one than that of Ira Levin. 
Had Leiber continued to write 
novels like Conjure Wife, or stories 
like “The Hound,” he might have 
developed a genuinely new genre of 
the horror story. 

As it is, he has left us a pro- 
totype of what that genre might 
look like. 

If you have not read Conjure 
Wife, do so. It is marvelous. ★

"f course, J. J. Without a doubt, 
J.J. I’ll get right on it, J.J. Good 
idea, J.J. Yes, I’ll have the column 
in your hands in a few days, J.J. 
Okay. .yes. .thanks for call- 
ing, J.J. 

“Hey, alter, who was that on the 
phone?’’ 

Geis, that was J.J. Pierce, editor 
of GALAXY, asking me, without a 
Geis-filter, asking me directly, to 
do a column discussing the hooroar 
over Harlan Ellison’s recent State- 
ment of Ethical Position as the up- 
coming Guest of Honor at the 
World SF Convention to be held at 
Phoenix, Arizona, August 30 — 
September 4, 1978. 

“He did? Mistake!! Mis- 
take! /Hand me the phone. I’ve got 
to stop this! You’ll bring the Wrath 
of Harlan down on us. GALAXY 
will go up in a puff of smoke. We 
both will be exiled to Alternate 
Earth #666. All Fandom will be in 
a state of war. ...” 

Relax, Geis. I’ll be very fair and 
even-tendriled. I’ll bend over side- 
ways to give both points of view. 

“Sideways? That’s the only way 
you can bend over, and a more dis- 

152 



gusting sight I’ve never seen.” 

Do not mock by physiology, 
Geis, or I’ll make public the pathet- 
ic length of your — 

“Alter!” 

— Nose. Now will you shut up 
and assist me in this column, or 
must I put out a want-ad for a prop- 
erly submissive, cooperative second 
banana? 

“I will do my duty, Alter, but 
you are tampering with forces and 
with a possible vengeful Harlan that 
Man Was Not Meant To Know.” 

Nevertheless and ipso facto, 
Geis. Let us proceed. Harlan Elli- 
son’s Statement of Position was 
published in GALAXY last issue. 
And it has been published in the fan 
press extensibly — Science Fiction 
Review and Locus being the two 
most prominent magazines — and it 
has provoked a good deal of reac- 
tion among fans. Now those reac- 
tions have a chance of surfacing 
here in a prozine. 

Briefly, Harlan is a strong sup- 
porter of the Equal Rights Amend- 
ment. 

Three years ago he agreed to 
be the official Guest of Honor at the 

GALAXY 



1978 World Convention. Since then 
the nitty has hit the gritty and the 
Amendment is only three states 
short of enough to pass, and 
Arizona is one of the states which 
has not passed the Amendment in 
its legislature. The National Organi- 
zation for Women has organized a 
convention boycott of those states 
which have not passed the Amend- 
ment, and so Harlan is in a 
pickle — attend the SF Worldcon in 
Arizona and thereby help attract 
people and money to Arizona, or 
not attend and break his word and 
disappoint a lot of fans? 

He has compromised. He pro- 
poses to attend — as Guest of 
Honor — but to use his position as 
GoH to push the ERA as hard as 
he can. 

Those who oppose his actions do 
so for various reasons. Some be- 
cause they don’t like Harlan and 
suspect he is merely grandstanding. 
Some because they go to SF con- 
ventions for fun and social reasons 
and don’t want the Con mucked up 
with a lot of political controversy 
and possible other fall-out. But 
most oppose his intended activities 
because they don’t want the official 
World Science Fiction Convention 
involved with politics or special- 
pleading Good Causes. Especially 
they don’t want this to happen by 
fiat, by a Guest of Honor imposing 
his politics on the Worldcon or by 
the Convention Committee doing 
same. 

“But, Alter, the Committee has 
agreed to let Harlan do his ERA 
thing as Guest of Honor. And since 
Harlan’s Statement of Ethical Posi- 
tion has been published extensively 
by now and the members of the 

ALIEN VIEWPOINT 



worldcon have had a chance to 
write to the Committee and give 
their views and the Committee has 
had a chance to get a ‘reading’ of 
the opinion of its paid members, 
what’s the problem?’’ 

Mostly philosophical, Geis. If the 
unofficial “vote” by the member- 
ship is heavily against Harlan’s po- 
sition, perhaps the Committee will 
make some changes — new rules for 
Harlan as Guest of Honor, or free- 
ing him of his obligation to attend. 
There are lots of other Big Name 
Authors who are available who 
would draw as well (if that’s a con- 
sideration). But of course the Con 
Committee is not bound by any un- 
official vote or preponderance of 
opinion of its membership in how to 
run the convention. It can do as it 
pleases. 

“Another argument is this. Alter:

Since Robert Heinlein has used the 
Worldcon to promote blood dona- 
tions to the Red Cross, and authors 
have used the Worldcon to promote 
sentiment for a greater U.S. space 
program, why not let Harlan use the 
Worldcon as a platform advocating 
ERA?” 

That’s the old “But Jimmy does 
it!” argument. And is countered by 
the ‘‘two wrongs don’t make a 
right” argument. Besides, the ERA 
is a highly controversial, loaded 
subject, and could provoke anti- 
ERA people to: 

1 . Demand equal time; 

2. Set up pickets, demonstrations, 
plan provocative acts during Har- 
lan’s speeches and appearances; 

3. File suit in local or federal 
court against the Worldcon Commit- 
tee and Harlan on grounds of 
restraint of trade or whatever. The 
states of Missouri and (anticipated) 
Arizona have already filed suit in 
federal court against the National 
Organization for Women using the 
restraint of trade argument in re the 
boycott of conventions in anti-ERA 
states. Since Harlan said in his 
Statement of Ethical Position that he 
would be coordinating his activities 
with N.O.W., that might place him 
and the Worldcon Committee in 
tender legal territory. 

‘‘But Alter, that federal suit is a 
blatant attempt to infringe civil 
rights. The right of free speech — ” 

Maybe, maybe. The point is it 
might result in some heavy, heavy 
legal costs imposed on the 
Worldcon, and that is something for 
the Worldcon members to think 
about. 

“You’re against ERA, aren’t 
you, Alter? Underneath that alien 

154 



hide beats the heart of a sexist male 
chauvinist pig!” 

Wrong, Geis! ‘I am for the 
Amendment. I am even for Gay 
Rights, for legalizing pot, legalizing 
prostitution, and legalizing alien 
immigration. (I want to be a citizen! 
I want to vote!) 

“That’,s what you say\ But you 
won’t do anything but yak yak. You 
won’t, as Harlan says, ‘walk the 
walk.’ You won’t be an activist.” 

You’re right, Geis. Walking hurts 
my pseudopods and since I mostly 
lurk in your brain, I am by nature 
and necessity an observer of idiot 
humanity, yourself included. 

“But—” 

Before you put your “but” into 
gear, listen to this last argument. 
Nothing prevents Harlan or anyone 
of similar persuasion from acting as 
an individual to promote ERA in 
Arizona through the local chapters 
of N.O.W- and other organizations 
sympathetic to ERA. There are all 
kinds of outlets for ERA activism. 
But Harlan wants to use the prestige 
and publicity of the World SF 
Convention — and SF in general — to 
add importance and impact to his 
activism. And that’s cool — if the 
Worldcon members and SF in gen- 
eral agree to his use of them in that 
way. 

But that leads to speculation 
about future Worldcons. .Will 
other Guests of Honor, or Worldcon 
Commiittees, decide to use the 
Worldcon for advancing other, dif- 
ferent political, social, economic 
ends? Will there have to be set up a 
voting system for Worldcon mem- 
bers to pass or kill various propos- 
als and advocacies? Will future 
groups who bid for the opportunity 

GALAXY 




to put on the Worldcon be required 
to pledge not to allow politicizing 
the convention, or say up-front what 
specific issue they will be pushing? 
Will groups be “captured” or 
“stacked” by fanatics of one sect, 
party, persuasion or another? Will 
we see, in a few years, a Liberal 
Democratic SF Convention? A 
Socialist People’s SF Con? A Nazi- 
Con? They could all claim that the 
future belongs to their dogma, and 
therefore they are right to use sci- 
ence fiction to help their cause. 

“Alter, you exaggerate.” 

Think so? The urge to use what- 
ever tool is available is natural in 
“activist” types. And since sf fans 
are supposed to be young, idealis- 
tic, future-minded. My position 
is that the World Science Fiction 
Convention should not be prosti- 
tuted to serve the interest of any 
present-day political, social or 
economic Cause, no matter how 
idealistic and right-thinking it is. 
There are plenty of other vehicles 
for sf fans, writers, editors, pub- 
lishers to use to push their urgent 
beliefs. 

“Are you through, Alter?” 

Yes. 

“You call that being fair? You 
call that performance giving both 
sides of the question?” 

Well, let me read back. 
Hmmmm. Mmmmm. Yeah, on the 
whole 1 think I gave Harlan and 
those who support him a fair pre- 
sentation. 

Of course I gave my views more 
emphasis, but that’s only natural, 
since I was invited to do so, and 
since this is my column-of-opinion. 
If you don’t like it, Geis, you can 
go pound sand. ★

DIRECTIONS 



Dear John, 

C.J. Cherryh’s The Faded Sun : Kes- 
rirli will, no doubt, become a science 
fiction classic. The story contains all the 
elements of what good science fiction 
ought to be. The craftsmanship of the 
author is superb, C.J. Cherryh paints a 
striking picture of a future which is to- 
tally alien to what we know. Carefully 
the author weeds details to have us beg- 
ging for more. The Faded Sun: Kesrith is 
the best science fiction story this year. I 
can not see how it can be outdone! 

Concerning your editorial, I really 
don’t know what you are driving at. 
Being only a passenger, I wished 1 had 
taken another taxi. You're serious. I’m 
serious, but he isn’t. What do you want 
me to do? Yes, I believe there isn’t an 
energy crisis. Why? Because things 
around us are going on as before in 
spite of the rhetoric that we hear. 1 am 
not sacrificing, and certainly you are 
not sacrificing. Thus, it will only be- 
come real when more things go off 
around us. That is how things work! 

Don't kick the Amish or the Menno- 
nites. If there is an energy crisis, they 
won’t know about it. Then again, if 
there is an energy crisis it might be a 
blessing in disguise. We Americans are 
extremely wasteful. We waste a lot 
energy. 

As for Jerry Pournelle, he should 



have had someone help him with 
Lucifer’s Hammer. It could have been a 
devastating novel. As it turned out, it is 
so poorly written that science fiction is 
in real trouble when such a novel is 
palmed off as being great. The review- 
ers and critics must have been wearing 
color glasses. 

Roy D. Schikedanz 
910 Sherwood Lake Dr., # 3B 
Schererville, 111., 46375 

I was not kicking the Amish and the 
Mennonites, and you're quite right 
about their being better adapted to sur- 
vive an energy (or any other) crisis. 
They work at the simple life and are 
willing to accept its responsibilities. 
Plastic hippies only talk about the sim- 
ple life while remaining tied by an um- 
bilical cord to the technological society 
they profess to despise. As for the “re- 
ality” of the crisis well, ever hear of a 
car that slopped going before it ran out 
of gas? Check the fuel gauge.' 

P.S.: Jerry did have help on 

Lucifer’s Hammer. You have heard of 
Larry Niven, haven't you? 

—J.J.P. 

Dear Mr Pournelle: 

Your column, A Step Farther Out, 
contained some errors concerning nu- 
clear fission power plants. 

It would be apparent that in any 
technology there are always risks when 
it involves the use of potentially 
dangerous elements. The elements 
themselves are intangible, but the han- 
dling of them by humanity isn’t. An 
example of this error is the deaths of 
between 50 and 75 percent of the 
uranium miners in the Shneeberg, Ger- 
many and Joachimstal, Czechoslovakia. 
The miners had inhaled radon gas. The 



156 



GALAXY 



studies were done before 1944. In 1947, 
the AEC conducted its own radon tests 
and found that the concentrations of 
radon in this country’s uranium mines 
were higher than those in Europe. 
There’s no way of knowing how many 
miners in this country have perished be- 
cause of the lack of post-mortem study. 

Thiry years have passed and there is 
still no technological diagnosis which 
will detect the damage done to a nuclear 
plant worker or miner’s body. 

Your information on radiation around 
nuclear plants (as compared to coal 
burning plants), is interesting. What you 
failed to mention, is that these types of 
radiation, as well as radio, television, 
and microwave relays, are the source of 
a substantially increasing level of low- 
leval ionizing radiation. At this time, 
the amount of LLIR in this country is 
1 ,000 times as great as in the Soviet 
Union. Perhaps they know something 
we don’t. 

My own skepticism over fission 
plants has to do with the transportation 
of nuclear wastes. I believe that the 
problems of waste storage and worker 
exposure could be solved; the latter by 
better monitoring equipment and pro- 
tective gear. But the transportation re- 
mains the primary problem. 

About a year and a half ago, a con- 
tainer of three ounces of pure plutonium 
fell off a truck in southern Indiana. Of 
course, the newspaper article appeared in 
the back of the paper and amounted to 
one column inch. Nothing was said 
about how long the material was lost, 
who found it, if there was damage to 
the container; nor who owned the mate- 
rial. This kind of human error cannot be 
plotted on a graph of statistical prob- 
abilities. It could, but it would be mean- 
ingless; as there is always a possiblity 
of X. 



On the lighter side, there’s an in- 
teresting article in TV guide, February 
4-10 issue. Carl Sagan, the author, talks 
about some of the inconsistencies of 
science fiction plotlines. One example 
he gives is that Mr. Spock of Star Trek 
is a genetic impossibility. As an alle- 
gory, he compares Spock’s existence to a 
human mated with an artichoke.

No one in his right mind has ever 
implied that nuclear energy is ‘ ‘safe’ ' in 
the sense that it has no costs; the rele- 
vent question is “costs compared to 
what?” The fact remains that the 
number of miners injured or killed in 
uranium mining is trivial compared to 
the accidentldeath rate for mining coal. 
This should come as no surprise, since 
uranium contains vastly more energy 
than coal. One might also compare the 
costs of a low-energy society to one that 
has sufficient clean power. 

Transport of nuclear wastes is ac- 
complished in containers stressed to 
withstand falls of many tens of feets. 
Pure plutonium is not a “nuclear 
waste ” and is not particularly danger- 
ous unless ingested (when it would be 
toxic but no more so than many heavy 
metals) or ground finely and inhaled. I 
shouldn’t care to inhale powdered arse- 
nic either. 

Regarding Mr. Spock’s ancestry. / 
suspect that Carl Sagan may have read 
Larry Niven's discussion of the sex life 
of Superman, in which Larry observed 
that Superman would be about as likely 
to produce a fertile union with an ear of 
corn as with a human female.

Dear Mr. Pierce: 

How about letting us have some hon- 
esty from your columnists? In recent 
years there has been what I see as a de- 
plorable trend in sf criticism towards the 
subjective response. Spider Robinson 
used to do it in Galaxy (and is still 
doing it elsewhere), and now so is Paul 
Walker. The approach is to find an 
honest but subjective response to the 
book in question, then justify the re- 
sponse in honest but subjective terms. 
In fact, the total process amounts to in- 
tellectual dishonesty. So far so good, 
because at least in a review-column the 
reader (and the author of the book) 
knows more or less how much impor- 
tance to attribute to what is said, but 
such writing is worthless as criticism 
and we are all the poorer for it. 

Where the line has to be drawn is 
when the method, crosses over into a 
general column like Richard Geis’ 
Alien Viewpoint, and he uses purely 
subjective criteria to dismiss books in a 
cavalier way. A case in point is his col- 
umn in the Dec/Jan issue, when as a 
part of his “crusade to improve the lot 
of the sf reader” he dismisses Robert P. 
Holdstock’s Eye Among the Blind be- 
cause it fails to have a snappy and jour- 
nalistic first paragraph. In fact, Geis 
tells us (in an honest way) he only 
managed to read the first three para- 
graphs before throwing the book across 
the room. 

Look, a novel like Eye Among the 
Blind is not to everyone’s taste. It isn’t 
likely to satisfy Perry Rhodan readers, 
for instance, or readers who use science 
fiction as a frivolous and mildly escapist 
alternative to TV. What it is (like Earth- 
wind, the author’s second novel) is a 
serious and demanding modern novel, 
which presumes a degree of in- 

158 



telligence in its readers. It is, in fact, an 
excellent example of the way contem- 
porary science fiction is moving away 
from the trite journalistic genre trap- 
pings of the past. It is also, although 
this won’t cut any ice with Geis, a first 
novel by a young and promising writer, 
and any first novel deserves to be read 
with an open mind. 

Any novel, come to that, deserves 
more than a cheap put-down.

/ didn’t think it was any secret that 
Geis was expressing his subjective opin- 
ions in The Alien Viewpoint. It is, 
however, interesting that you. the au- 
thor of several novels and short stories 
devoted to the thesis that "reality" is 
subjective (in the tradition of Berkeley 
and Hume) — or might as well be. for 
alt we can trust our prejudiced 
perceptions — can be so certain about 
objective standards in literature.

Dear Sir: 

On page 156 of the Dec/Jan 1978 
issue (hey, that date is really good; 
takes real talent to combine both 
January and December of the same 
year) you ask: “Why are at least half 
the best new writers women, even 
though the total percentage of women 
entering the field is still low?” 

As it happened. I’d just been consult- 
ing a back issue. The one where Spider 
Robinson was doing a “So there” on 
the testimony of some women writers 
that they’d never had any sf stories re- 



GALAXY 




jected because they were women. But 
look, the “few” women writers in the 
field have always been superlative. 
Doesn’t that answer your question? 
Whereas there are all kinds of men sci- 
ence fiction writers, of which “90 per- 
cent are crud” (Sturgeon’s Law). Any 
year with one new woman writer ac- 
cepted and published, she’s probably 
not just fifty percent, but a hundred 
percent of the good new writers that 
year.

Well. / hope I'm not one of those 
editors who unconciously (/ know / 
don’t do it consciously) demands higher 
standards of female than male novice 
writers. Of course, ideally. I'd like to 
get the best of both ....

Dear Galaxy: 

I was amazed to read the two letters 
from women sf fans. I’d love to have 
read Mr. Cooper’s letter. 

Anyway, I have been an sf reader 
since age 12 (in 1948) when I conned 
Mama into getting me a library card to 
read fact books on astronomy and a li- 
brarian turned me on to Red Planet by 
Heinlein (She was tired of digging' up 
astronomy texts — which were valuable 
books — to send home with a 12-year 
old). 

I think I can name five other women 
fans I’ve come across in the past 30 
years (two of them being my grown 
daughters whom I led into it all with 
Space Cat). I always assumed I was a 
person, as a dog often will, and even 
when my physics teacher said that the 

DIRECTIONS 



few girls he’d had in class didn’t be- 
come engineers, but usually married 
them instead (I didn’t become an en- 
gineer either — or anything until I was 
32 years old and had a family of 
medium-sized children to support, 
alone), I wondered on. 

Funny, I’ve written all my life — 
newsletters, poetry, etc. — on a volun- 
teer basis, but I never dared write an sf 
story. I wonder why? 

Also, since all heroes of sf were 36 
years old when they and fell in love, I 
did that too, marrying the “handsomest 
2 1 -year old in Central Pennsylvania, 
just like in the stories. It never dawned 
on me that those heroes were men and I 
wasn’t the right sex. 

So, finally, women are starting to 
write sf and doing a pretty good job of 
it too, and women are beginning to 
admit to being a shade talented in 
science — well, current events, maybe. 

Well, what I’d like to do is start a 
women’s sf fan group to give us less 
feeling of isolation (Men do not tend to 
discuss sf with us. I notice.). Any in- 
terested women write me for details (I 
have great expertise at starting 
things— a feminist credit union, a wom- 
en’s rights organization, P.T.A., etc.

Brother! (Sister?!). First a poor femme- 
fan who can't find sf magazines and 
didn’t know they existed: now a femme- 
fan men fans won't talk to and planning 
to start a women’s fan group. I thought 
all fan groups welcomed women. Can I 
be that naive ? Or is New Cumberland. 
Pa., really the boondocks?

ODDS AND ENDS 

Two mailers we meant to cover last month, but which got lost in 
the shuffle: 

Yes, there were loose ends in The Faded Sun: Kesrith. That’s be- 
cause it's the first novel in a trilogy. We told C.J. Cherryh people 
might wonder what the dux was going on, and she responded: 
“Ouch! That were a most n-regul-ar pun!” 

And if some of you think Greg Ben fond’s The Stars in Shroud 
looks familiar ... Well, about ten years ago, Greg published a 
novel called Deeper than the Darkness. Readers seemed to like it. 
but he didn't. He was so dissatisfied that he bought up the copyrights 
in order to rewrite it entirely. Not quite unprecedented — Arthur C. 
Clarke rewrote Against the Fall of Night as The City and the Stars: 
but Clarke was never able to get rid of the first version! 

Among next month’s offerings .... we got a story in the slush 
pile from a Tappan King. Read like Tanith Lee (Wow!). We sent an 
acceptance letter to Mr. or Ms. King. Turned out to be Mr. And his 
odd name? “You wouldn’t think it was odd for a grandson of Austin 
Tappan Wright,” he commented. (If you’ve never read Islandia. 
shame on you!)
