EDITORIAL 



FUSION 

T-s is the first issue of Galaxy incorporating Worlds of IF. In 
this regard I would like to quote the relevant portions of my 
Editorial in IF's final issue: 

But be of good cheer. The rowdy, fun-loving 
spirit I have striven to infuse into this magazine 
will not be lost, but will sound in clear if muted 
tones in a fusion of the best of two worlds — the 
best of Galaxy, which has long stood for in- 
tellectual and esthetic pre-eminence, and the best 
of this magazine. And surely I don’t have to tell 
you what IF is all about! 

m 

Here are a few of the contributions to that new 
magazine that otherwise would have appeared in 
Worlds of IF. The Alien Viewpoint of Dick Geis 
will continue to delight and enrage you on a bi- 
monthly basis. The Editor's Page will also main- 
tain a bimonthly presence, as will SF Calendar. 

Sign of the Unicorn, a new Amber novel by Roger 
Zelazny (this year’s WORLDCON Guest of 
Honor) will first see print in the new Galaxy/IF. 

A new Mack Reynolds story. A new Chandler. A 
“Berserker.” And (as the saying goes), much, 
much more! 

So let us make a virtue of our necessities. Heretofore Galaxy and 
Worlds of IF have each catered largely to a particular sub-set 
within the generality of science fiction readers. Now the task is 
simpler; to aim straight for the center, to create — hopefully with 
the aid of massive reader feedback — the ideal sf magazine. With a 
lot of help from my friends, I think I can do it. 

So welcome to Galaxy, incorporating Worlds of IF — the best 
science fiction magazine in the World!

Gene Wolfe 






Y es, I remember killing my first 
man very well; I was just seven- 
teen. A flock of snow geese flew 
under us that day about noon. I 
remember looking over the side of 
the basket, and seeing them; and 
thinking that they looked like a 
pike-head. That was an omen, of 
course, but 1 did not pay any atten- 
tion. 

It was clear, fall weather — a 
trifle chilly. I remember that. It 
must have been about the mid-part 
of October. Good weather for the 
balloon. Clow would reach up every 
quarter hour or so with a few 
double handsful of straw for the 
brazier, and that was all it re- 
quired. We cruised, usually, at 
about twice the height of a steeple. 

You have never been in one? 
Well, that shows how things have 
changed. Before the Fire-wights 
came, there was hardly any fighting 
at all. and free swords had to travel 
all over the continent looking for 
what there vas. A balloon was 
better than walking, believe me. 
Miles — he was our captain in those 
days — said that where there were 
three soldiers together, one was cer- 
tain to put a shaft through a 



balloon; it was too big a target to 
resist, and that would show you 
where the armies were. 

No, we would not have been 
killed. You would have had to slit 
the thing .vide open before it would 
fall fast, and a little hole like the 
business end of a pike would make 
would just barely let you know it 
was there. The baskets do not 
swing, either, as people think. Why 
should they? They feel no wind — 
they are .aveling with it. A man 
just seems to hang there, when he is 
up in one of them, and the world 
turns under him. He can hear 
everything — pigs and chickens, and 
the squeak the windlass makes 
drawing water from a well. 

"Good flying weather,” Clow 
said to me. 

1 nodded. Solemnly, 1 suppose. 

“All the lift you want, in weather 
like this. The colder it is, the better 
she pulls. The heat from the fire 
doesn’t like the chill, and tries to 
escape from it. That’s what they 
say." 

Blond Bracata spat over the side. 
“Nothing in our bellies,” she said, 
"that’s what makes it lift. If we 
don’t eat today you won’t have to

GALAXY 




light the fire tomorrow — I’ll take us 
up myself.” 

She was taller than any of us ex- 
cept Miles, and the heaviest of us 
all; but Miles would not allow for 
size when the food was passed out, 
so I suppose she was the hungriest 
too. 

Derek said: “We should have 
stretched one of that last bunch 
over the fire. That would have 
fetched a pot of stew, at the least.” 
Miles shook his head. “There 
were too many.” 

“They would have run like 
rabbits.” 

“And if they hadn’t?” 

“They had no armor.” 
Unexpectantly, Bracata came in 
for the captain. “They had twenty- 
two men, and fourteen women. I 
counted them.” 

“The women wouldn’t fight.” 

"1 used to be one of them. I 
would have fought.” 

Clow’s soft voice added, “Nearly 
any woman will fight if she can get 
behind you.” 

Bracata stared at him, not sure 
whether he was supporting her or 
not. She had her mitts on — she was 
as good with them as anyone I have 
ever seen — and I remember that I 
thought for an instant that she 
would go for Clow right there in the 
basket. We were packed in like 
Hedgings in the nest, and fighting, 
it w ould have taken at least three of 
us to throw' her out — by which time 
she would have killed us all, I sup- 
pose. But she w'as afraid of Clow. 1 
found out why later. She respected 
Miles, 1 think, for his judgment 
and courage, without being afraid 
of him. She did not care much for 
Derek either way. and of course I 



was hardly there at all as far as she 
was concerned. But she was just a 
little frightened by Clow. 

Clow was the only one I was not 
frightened by — but that is another 
story too. 

“Give it more straw,” Miles said. 

“We’re nearly out.” 

“We can’t land in this forest.” 

Clow shook his head and added 
straw to the fire in the brazier — 
about half as much as he usually 
did. We were sinking toward what 
looked like a red and gold carpet. 

“We got straw out of them any- 
way,” I said, just to let the others 
know' 1 was there. 

“You can always get straw,” 
Clow told me. He had drawn a 
throwing spike, and was feigning to 
clean his nails with it. “Even from 
swineherds, who you’d think 
wouldn’t have it. They’ll get it to be 
rid of us.” 

“Bracata’s right,” Miles said. He 
gave the impression that he had not 
heard Clow' and me. “We have to 
have food today.” 

Derek snorted. “What if there 
are twenty?” 

“We stretch one over the fire. 
Isn’t that what you suggested? And 
if it takes fighting, we fight. But we 
have to eat today.” He looked at 
me. “What did 1 tell you when you 
joined us. Jerr? High pay or 
nothing? This is the nothing. Want 
to quit?” 

1 said, “Not if you don’t want me 
to.” 

Clow w'as scraping the last of the 
straw from the bag. It was hardly a 
handful. As he threw it in the 
brazier Bracata asked, “Are we 
going to set down in the trees?” 

Clow shook his head and point- 



STRAW

ed. Aw ay in the distance 1 could see 
a speck of w hite on a hill. It looked 
too far. but the wind was taking us 
there, and it grew and grew' until we 
could see that it was a big house, all 
built of white brick, with gardens 
and outbuildings, and a road that 
ran up to the door. There are none 
like that left now, I suppose. 

w andings are the most exciting 
| j part of traveling by balloon, 
and sometimes the most unpleas- 
ant. If you are lucky, the basket 
stays upright. We were not. Our 
basket snagged and tipped over 
and w as dragged along by the enve- 
lope. which fought the wind and 
did not want to go down, cold 
though it was by then. If there had 
been a fire in the brazier still, I 
suppose we would have set the 
meadow ablaze. As it was, we were 
tumbled about like toys. Bracata 
fell on top of me, as heavy as stone: 
and she had the claws of her mits 
out. trying to dig them into the turf 
to stop herself, so that for a 
moment 1 thought I was going to be 
killed. Derek’s pike had been 
charged, and the ratchet released 
in the confusion; the head went fly- 
ing across the field, just missing a 
cow . 

By the time 1 recovered my 
breath and got to my feet. Clow had 
the envelope under control and was 
treading it down. Miles was up too, 
straightening his hauberk and 
sword-belt. “Look like a soldier," 
he called to me. “Where are your 
weapons?" 

A pincer-mace and my pike were 
all I had, and the pincer-mace had 
fallen out of the basket. After five 
minutes of looking. I found it in the 



tall grass, and went over to help 
('low fold the envelope. 

When we were finished, we 
stuffed it in the basket and put our 
pikes through the rings on each 
side so we could carry it. By that 
time we could see men on horse- 
back coming down from the big 
house. Derek said, "We won’t be 
able to stand against horsemen in 
this Held." 

For an instant I saw Miles smile. 
Then he looked very serious. "We’ll 
have one of those fellows over a tire 
in half an hour.” 

Derek was counting, and so was 
I. Eight horsemen, with a cart 
following them. Several of the 
horsemen had lances, and 1 could 
see the sunlight winking on helmets 
and breastplates. Derek began 
pounding the butt of his pike on the 
ground to charge it. 

I suggested to Clow that it might 
look more friendly if we picked up 
the balloon and went to meet the 
horsemen, but he shook his head. 
"Why bother?" 

I he lirst of them had reached the 
fence around the field. He was 
silting a roan stallion that took it at 
a clean jump and came thundering 
up to us looking as big as a donjon 
on wheels. 

"Greetings,” Miles called. “If 
this be your land, lord, we give 
thanks for your hospitality. We’d 
not have intruded, but our 
conveyance has exhausted its fuel.” 

“You are welcome,” the horse- 
man called. He was as tall as Miles 
or taller, as well as 1 could judge, 
and as wide as Bracata. “Needs 
must, as they say, and no harm 
done.” Three of the others had 
jumped their mounts over the fence 



10 



GALAXY 




behind him. The rest were taking 
down the rails so the cart could get 
through. 

“Have you straw, lord?” Miles 
asked. I thought it would have been 
better if he had asked for food. “If 
we could have a few bundles of 
straw, we’d not trouble you more.” 

"None here,” the horseman said, 
waving a mail-clad arm at the fields 
around us, “yet I feel sure my 
bailiff could find you some. Come 
up to the hall for a taste of meat 
and a glass of wine, and you can 
make your ascension from the ter- 
raee; the ladies would be delighted 
to see it. I’m certain. You’re 
lloating swords. I take it?” 

“We are that,” our captain af- 
firmed. “but persons of good 
character nonetheless. We're called 
the Faithful Five — perhaps you’ve 
heard of us? High-hearted, fierce- 
fighting wind-warriors all, as it says 
on the balloon." 

A younger man, who had reined 
up next to the one Miles called 
"lord." snorted. "If that boy is 
high-hearted, or a fierce fighter 
either. I’ll eat his breeks.” 

Of course, I should not have 
done it. ! have been too mettlesome 
all my life, and it has gotten me in 
more trouble than I could tell you 
of if I talked till sunset, though it 
has been good to me too — I would 
have spent my days following the 
plow, I suppose, if I had not 
knocked down Derek for what he 
called our goose. But you see how it 
was. Here 1 had been thinking of 
myself as a hard-bitten balloon 
soldier, and then to hear something 
like that. Anyway, 1 swung the 
pincer-mace overhand once I had a 
good grip on his stirrup. I had been 



afraid the extension spring was a 
bit weak, never having used one be- 
fore, but it worked well; the pliers 
got him under the left arm and be- 
tween the ear and the right 
shoulder, and would have cracked 
his neck for him properly if he had 
not been wearing a gorget. As it 
was. I jerked him off his horse 
pretty handily, and got out the little 
aniace that screwed into the mace 
handle. A couple of the other horse- 
men couched their lances, and 
Derek had a finger on the dog- 
catch of his pike; so all in all it 
looked as if there could be a proper 
fight, but “lord” (I learned after- 
wards that he was the Baron Asco- 
lot) yelled at the young man I had 
pulled out of his saddle, and Miles 
yelled at me and grabbed my left 
wrist, and thus it all blew over. 

When we had tripped the release 
and gotten the mace open and re- 
tracted again. Miles said: “He will 
be punished, lord. Leave him to 
me. It will be severe, I assure you.” 

“No, upon my oath,” the baron 
declared. “It will teach my son to 
be less free with his tongue in the 
company of armed men. He has 
been raised at the hall. Captain, 
where everyone bends the knee to 
him. He must learn not to expect 
that of strangers.” 

The cart rolled up just then, 
drawn by two fine mules- — either of 
them would have been worth my 
father’s holding, I judged — and at 
the baron's urging we loaded our 
balloon into it and climbed in after 
it ourselves, sitting on the fabric. 
The horsemen galloped off, and the 
cart driver cracked his lash over the 
mules' backs. 

“Quite a place,” Miles remark- 



STRAW

ed. He was looking up at the big 
house toward which we were 
making. 

1 whispered to Clow, “A palace, I 
should say,” and Miles overheard 
me, and said: “It’s a villa, Jerr — 
the unfortified country property of 
a gentleman. If there were a wall 
and a tower, it would be a castle, or 
at least a castellet.” 

T here w'ere gardens in front, 
very beautiful as 1 remember, 
and a fountain. The road looped up 
before the door, and we got out and 
trooped into the hall, while the 
baron’s man — he was richer-dress- 
ed than anybody I had ever seen up 
till then, a fat man with white 
hair — set two of the hostlers to 
watch our balloon while it was 
taken back to the stableyard. 

Venison and beef were on the 
table, and even a pheasant with all 
his feathers put back; and the 
baron and his sons sat with us and 
drank some wine and ate a bit of 
bread each for hospitality's sake. 
Then the baron said, “Surely you 
don’t fly in the dark, captain?” 
“Not unless we must, lord.” 
“Then w’ith the day drawing to a 
close, it’s just as well for you that 
we've no straw'. You can pass the 
night with us, and in the morning 
I’ll send my bailiff to the village 
with the cart. You'll be able to 
ascend at mid-morning, when the 
ladies can have a clear view of you 
as you go up.” 

“No straw ?”- our captain asked. 
“None, 1 fear, here. But they’ll 
have aplenty in the village, never 
doubt it. They lay it in the road to 
silence the horses’ hoofs when a 
woman’s w'ith child, as I’ve seen 



many a time. You’ll have a cartload 
as a gift from me, if you can use 
that much." The baron smiled as 
he said that; he had a friendly face, 
round and red as an apple. “Now 
lell me." (he went on) “how it is to 
be a floating sword. I always find 
other men’s trades of interest, and 
it seems to me you follow one of the 
most fascinating of all. For 
example, how do you gauge the 
charge you will make your 
employer?” 

“We have two scales, lord,” 
Miles began. I had heard all of that 
before, so I stopped listening. 
Bracata was next to me at table, so 
I had all I could do to get some- 
thing to eat for myself, and I doubt 
I ever got a taste of the pheasant. 
By good luck, a couple of lasses — 
the baron’s daughters — had come 
in, and one of them started curling 
a lock of Derek's hair around her 
finger, so that distracted him while 
he was helping himself to the veni- 
son, and Bracata .put an arm 
around the other and warned her of 
Men. If it had not been for that I 
would not have had a thing; as it 
w as. I stuffed myself on deer’s meat 
until 1 had to loose my waistband. 
Flesh of any sort had been a rarity 
where I came from. 

I had thought that the baron 
might give us beds in the house, but 
when we had eaten and drunk all 
we could hold, the white-haired fat 
man led us out a side door and over 
to a wattle-walled building full of 
bunks — 1 suppose it was kept for 
the extra laborers needed at har- 
vest. It was not the palace bedroom 
I had been dreaming of; but it was 
cleaner than home, and there was a 
big fireplace down at one end with 



12 



GALAXY 




logs stacked ready by, so it was 
probably more comfortable for me 
than a bed in the big house itself 
would have been. 

Clow took out a piece of cherry 
wood, and started carving a woman 
in it. and Bracata and Derek lay 
dow n to sleep. 1 made shift to talk 
to Miles, but he was full of 
thoughts, silting on a bench near 
the hearth and chinking the purse 
(just like this one, it was) he had 
gotten from the baron; so I tried to 
sleep too. But I had had too much 
to cat to sleep so soon, and since it 
was still light out, I decided to walk 
around the villa and try to find 
somebody to chat with. The front 
looked too grand for me; 1 went to 
the back, thinking to make sure 
our balloon had suffered no hurt, 
and perhaps have another look at 
those mules. 

T here were three barns behind 
the house, built of stone up to 
height of my waist, and wood 
above that, and whitewashed. I 
walked into the nearest of them, 
not thinking about anything much 
besides my full belly until a big war 
horse w ith a white star on his fore- 
head reached his head out of his 
stall and nuzzled at my cheek. 1 
reached out and stroked his neck 
for him the way they like. He nick- 
ered, and I turned to have a better 
look at him. That was when I. saw 
w hat was in his stall. He was stand- 
ing on a span or more of the clean- 
est. yellowest straw I had ever seen. 

I looked up over my head then, and 
there was a loft full of it up there. 

In a minute or so, I suppose it 
was, 1 was back in the building 
where we were to sleep, shaking 



Miles by the shoulder and telling 
him I had found all the straw any- 
one could ask for. 

He did not seem to understand, 
at first. “Wagon loads of straw. 
Captain.” I told him. “Why every 
horse in the place has as much to 
lay him on as would carry us a 
hundred leagues.” 

“All right,” Miles told me. 
"Captain — ” 

“There’s no straw here, Jerr. Not 
for us. Now be a sensible lad and 
get some rest.” 

“But there is, Captain. I saw it. I 
can bring you back a helmetful.” 
“Come here, Jerr,” he said, and 
got up and led me outside. 1 
thought he was going to ask me to 
show him the straw; but instead of 
going back to where the barns 
were, he took me away from the 
house to the top of a grassy knoll. 
“Look out there, Jerr. Far off. 
What do you see?” 

“Trees.” 1 said. “There might be 
a river at the bottom of the valley; 
then more trees on the other side.” 
“Beyond that.” 

I looked to the horizon, where he 
seemed to be pointing. There were 
little threads of black smoke rising 
there, looking as thin as spider web 
at that distance. 

“What do you see?” 

“Smoke.” 

“That’s straw burning, Jerr. 
House-thatch. That’s why there’s 
no straw here. Gold, but no straw, 
because a soldier gets straw only 
where he isn’t welcome. They’ll 
reach the river there by sundown, 
and I'm told it can be forded at this 
season. Now' do you understand?” 
They came that night at moon- 
rise. «

ROGER ZELAZNY 







AN ESSAY IN AMBER 



It was starting to end, after what 
seemed most of eternity to me. 

Thus began Nine Princes in 
Amber, with the awakening of an 
amnesiac patient in a private sani- 
torium in upstate New York. Some- 
thing about the arrangement 
seemed very wrong to him, so he 
contrived to escape, learning three 
things while he was about it: he was 
registered as Carl Corey; his next of 
kin was apparently a sister named 
Evelyn Flaumel, residing in West- 
chester; his condition was sup- 
posedly such that he should be un- 
able to stand, let alone walk out. 

He departed, proceeding at once 
to the residence in Westchester. 
There he met Evelyn, saw that she 
was frightened, realized the oppor- 
tunity this represented and engaged 
her in an ad lib bluffing session 
wherein he succeeded in convincing 
her that he had recovered his 
memory. During the course of this, 
he became convinced that she was 
indeed his sister. This stirred the 
return of other, peculiar memory 
fragments which he seized upon to 
strengthen his story. During the 
conversation -he learned that his 
name was really Corwin, that he 
was originally from a place called 
Amber and that there were 
numerous other siblings about, few 
of them kindly disposed toward 
him. 

The following day, during 
Evelyn's absence, he discovered a 



strange deck of Tarot-like cards in 
a concealed drawer in her desk. 
The major trumps, he quickly 
realized, were representations of 
the various family members — him- 
self among them. Studying them, 
he recognized the following in- 
dividuals: 

Random — wily, small, sharp- 
nosed, laughing mouth, straw- 
colored hair, dressed in a Renais- 
sance costume of orange, red and 
brown. 

Julian — dark hair, blue eyes, 
passive expression, dressed in 
scaled white armor which looked as 
if it had been enameled. 

Caine — swarthy, dark eyed, 
dressed all in satin of black and 
green, wearing a three-cornered 
hat. 

Eric — big, dark hair and beard, 
dressed in a leather jacket and 
leggings, a plain cloak, high black 
boots. 

Benedict — tall, thin, dour, long 
of jaw , hazel eyes and brown hair, 
clad in orange and yellow and 
brown. 

Gerard — a huge, powerfully 
built man, clad in a light blue 
dressing gown and a black belt. 

Bleys- — red beard, red hair, blue 
eyes, clad in red and orange. 

Brand — small, beardless, red- 
haired, dressed in green, mounted 
on a white horse. 

Flora (Evelyn) — blonde, green- 
eyed. clad in green. 



15 




Deirdre — brunette, blue-eyed, 

dressed in black and silver. 

Fiona — small, red-haired, green- 
eyed. 

Llewella — green haired, gray- 
eyed, clad in gray and green and 
lavender. 

— All of them were very cold to the 
touch. 

Things happened quickly that 
day. Corwin answered the tele- 
phone and the caller proved to be 
his brother Random, in trouble and 
looking for help. He agreed to help 
him. Random arrived later that 
same day, pursued by not quite 
human beings whom they fought 
and dispatched. 

The following day, having also 
taken in Random as to the state of 
his memory, Corwin agreed to an 
attempt to reach Amber, driving 
Evelyn/Flora’s car. The roadway 
altered, the world itself changed 
about them as Corwin drove. He 
realized that somehow Random 
was responsible for these effects — 
that he was conveying them 
through something he called 
Shadow- in order to. reach the real 
world. Amber. After an extremely 
eventful journey, they succeeded — 
encountering en route their brother 
Julian, w'ho seemed to wish them 
somewhat less than well, and their 
sister Deirdre, whom they rescued 
from a bit of mischief. Then, in 
sight of Amber, Corwin confessed 
the true state of his memory. 

Deirdre and Random decided 
that the best possible remedy w'ould 
be for Corwin to walk the Pattern 
located in a city called Rebma, 
Amber’s mirror image beneath the 
sea. This was done, and the Pattern 
restored most of Corwin’s memory 



along with his power over Shadow. 
Corwin then drew upon the power 
of the Pattern to transport himself 
into Amber, where he confronted 
his brother Eric. Eric, he realized, 
had been responsible both for the 
original injury w hich had produced 
his amnesia and for his exile to the 
shadow-world. Earth. Eric was 
planning on taking the throne, left 
vacant by the long absence of their 
father Oberon, now presumed 
dead. 

Corwin and Eric fought an in- 
conclusive duel, from which Corwin 
tied when palace guards arrived. 
Utilizing a deck of the family cards, 
which he then knew to be com- 
munication and transportation de- 
vices, Corwin went to his brother 
Bleys, whom he discovered to be in 
the process of putting together an 
army and a fleet of ships for pur- 
poses of assaulting Amber before 
Eric could take the throne. Corwin 
agreed to join him in this effort. 
They were later defeated in the 
military engagements which oc- 
curred. Bleys may or may not have 
perished in a fall from Kolvir, the 
mountain upon which Amber is 
situated. 

Corwin, then Eric’s prisoner, was 
forced to participate in Eric’s coro- 
nation, after which he was blinded 
and cast into the dungeons beneath 
Amber. He laid a curse upon 
Amber at that time. Years passed, 
during which his eye tissues slowly 
regenerated. He was later assisted 
in escaping from the dungeons by 
Dworkin — his father’s old adviser, 
the creator of the Trumps — who 
was now' apparently quite mad. 

The book ends with Corwin sail- 
ing away from Amber: 



16 



GALAXY 




A demon wind propelled me east 
of the sun. 

The Guns of. Avalon is the story 
of Corwin’s search for Avalon, one 
of the shadow images of Amber, 
where he had once ruled. He was 
aware that a polishing rouge used 
by jewelers in that place could be 
caused to ignite in Amber, where 
gunpowder and other known explo- 
sives would not. He intended to 
employ a different type of warfare 
in his attempt to wrest the throne 
from Eric. 

In the course of his search, he be- 
came involved in the troubles of a 
land called Lorraine, ruled by a 
half-willing regent named Ganelon, 
who appeared to be one of his own 
former generals — a man he had 
personally exiled from Avalon ages 
before. The ills of this land, Lor- 
raine, were strangely like those 
which now lay upon Amber, and he 
felt constrained to remain for a 
time and help to combat them. The 
presence of a woman, also named 
Lorraine, added to his resolve in 
this respect. 

The creatures responsible for the 
situation were later vanquished at 
(he center of their place of power, 
but not before Corwin was recog- 
nized by their leader and named by 
him as the one who had provided 
them entry to the world. Lorraine 
was subsequently slain by the man 
with whom she had run off follow- 
ing a disagreement with Corwin. 

Corwin and Ganelon proceeded 
to Avalon, which recently had faced 
similar problems of its own. The 
situation had been settled, how- 
ever, by the Protector of Avalon, 
who proved to be Corwin’s elder 
brother Benedict — who had lost his 



right arm in that final battle. 

Corwin and Ganelon remained in 
Avalon as Benedict’s guests. There 
Corwin met a girl named Dara who 
claimed to be Benedict’s great- 
granddaughter. She was anxious to 
learn of Amber and to visit there. 
Corwin told her of the Pattern, the 
Trumps and of Shadow — things 
she claimed Benedict had never 
properly explained to her. Later, 
Corwin and Dara became casually 
involved. 

Corwin obtained the chemicals 
he sought, and on preparing to de- 
part Avalon was advised by 
Ganelon that there were several 
fresh corpses in the woods nearby. 
Deciding not to seek further 
trouble, Corwin and Ganelon did 
nothing about this situation. They 
departed quickly, heading for an 
eventual meeting in Brussels with 
an arms merchant Corwin had 
known when he had lived on the 
shadow Earth. 

They were pursued by Benedict, 
and Corwin assumed the reason to 
be his actions with Dara. When he 
faced Benedict in combat beside 
the black road, however, Benedict 
disavowed any knowledge of the 
existence of Dara and accused Cor- 
win of the murder of his retainers. 
Corwin managed to best Benedict 
by means of a ruse involving the 
black road itself — a phenomenon 
somehow connected with the 
troubles of Amber, Lorraine and 
Avalon, cutting through a great 
number of the shadow worlds, 
spreading ill wherever it touched. 

Leaving Benedict bound and un- 
conscious, Corwin summoned Ge- 
rard via his Trump to attend to 
him. He then proceeded to Earth,

obtained arms and ammunition, 
recruited a shadow assault force 
and returned to Amber for pur- 
poses of disposing of Eric. 

He arrived in the middle of a 
battle, however. Amber was under 
attack by creatures which had 
reached it over the black road. He 
joined with the forces of Amber in 
repelling the attack. Eric was 
fatally injured in the fighting. 

Before his death, Eric gave Cor- 
win the Jewel of Judgment, the 
weapon he had used against him in 
the attack Corwin and Bleys had 
commanded years before. As he lay 
dying, he partly instructed Corwin 
as to its attunement. 

Dara then appeared on the 
scene, advanced into the city, 
reached the Pattern and walked 
it — an ability supposedly only 
possessed by those of the blood of 
Amber. She underwent peculiar 
transformations during this pas- 
sage. Completing the Pattern, she 
announced that Amber would be 
destroyed. 

Then she vanished, giving no 
reason for this threat. 

I 

T ignored the questions in the 
I eyes of the groom as 1 lowered 
the grisly parcel and turned the 
horse in for care and maintenance. 
My cloak could not really conceal 
the nature of its contents as I slung 
the guts over my shoulder and 
stamped off toward the rear en- 
trance to the palace. Hell would 
soon be demanding its paycheck. 

1 skirted the exercise area and 
made my w ay to the trail that led 
toward the southern end of the 



palace gardens. Fewer eyes along 
that route. I would still be spotted, 
but it would be a lot less awkward 
than going in the front way where 
things are always busy. Damn. 

And again, damn. Of troubles 1 
considered myself amply possessed. 
But those w ho have do seem to get. 
Some spiritual form of compound 
interest, 1 suppose. 

There were a few idlers beside 
the fountain at the far end of the 
garden. Also, a couple guards were 
passing among the bushes near the 
trail. The guards saw me coming, 
held a brief discussion and looked 
the other way. Prudent. 

Me. back less than a week. Most 
things, still unresolved. The court 
of Amber, full of suspicion and un- 
rest. This, now: a death to further 
jeopardize the brief, unhappy pre- 
reign of Corw in I: me. 

Time now to do something 1 
should have done right away. But 
there had been so many things to 
do, from the very first. It was not as 
if I had been nodding, as I saw it. I 
had assigned priorities and acted 
on them. Now, though . 

1 crossed the garden, out of the 
shade and into the slanting sun- 
light. 1 sw'ung up the wide, curving 
stair. A guard snapped to attention 
as 1 entered the palace. I made for 
the rear stairway, then up to the 
second floor. Then the third. 

From the right, my brother 
Random stepped out of his suite 
and into the hallway. 

“Corwin!” he said, studying my 
face. “What's the matter? 1 saw 
you from the balcony and — ” 

“Inside.” 1 said, gesturing with 
my eyes. “We are going to have a 
private conference. Now."

He hesitated, regarding my 
burden. 

“Let’s make it two rooms up,” he 
said. “Okay? Vialle’s in here.” 

“All right.” 

He led the way, opened the door. 
I entered the small sitting room, 
sought a likely spot, dropped the 
body. 

Random stared at the bundle. 

“What am I supposed to do?” he 
asked . 

“Unwrap the goodies,” I said, 
"and take a look.” 

He knelt and undid the cloak. He 
folded it back. 

“Dead all right,” he observed. 
“What’s the problem?” 

“You did not look closely 
enough,” I said. “Peel back an eye- 
lid. Open the mouth and look at 
the teeth. Feel the spurs on the 
backs of the hands. Count the 
joints in the fingers. Then you tell 
me about the problem.” 

He began doing these things. As 
soon as he looked at the hands he 
stopped and nodded. 

“All right,” he said. “I 
remember.” 

“Remember out loud.” 

“It was back at Flora’s 
place . .” 

“That was where I first saw any- 
one like this," 1 said. “They were 
after you, though. I never did find 
out why.” 

“That’s right,” he said. "I never 
got a chance to tell you about it. 
We weren’t together all that long. 
Strange . Where did this one 
come from?” 

1 hesitated, torn between push- 
ing him for his story and telling him 
mine. Mine won out because it was 
mine and very immediate. 



I sighed and sank into a chair. 
"We’ve just lost us another 
brother,” I said. “Caine is dead. 1 
got there a bit too late. That 
thing — person — did it. I wanted it 
alive, for obvious reasons. But it 
put up quite a fight. I didn’t have 
much of a choice.” 

He whistled softly, seated himself 
in the chair opposite me. 

“1 see.” he said, very softly. 

I studied his face. Was that the 
faintest of smiles waiting in the 
wings to enter and meet my own? 
Quite possibly. 

“No,” I said flatly. “If it were 
otherwise, I would have arranged 
for a lot less doubt as to my inno- 
cence. I’m telling you what really 
happened.” 

“All right,” he said. “Where is 
Caine?” 

“Under a layer of sod, near the 
Grove of the Unicorn.” 

“That looks suspicious right 
there.” he said. “Or will. To the 
others.” 

1 nodded. 

“I know. 1 had to hide the body 
and cover it in the meantime, 
though. I couldn’t just bring him 
back and start parrying questions. 
Not when there were important 
facts waiting for me, in your head.” 
“Okay,” he said. “I don’t know 
how important they are, but they’re 
yours. But don’t leave me hanging, 
huh? How did this thing happen?” 
“It was right after lunch,” I said. 
“I had eaten down at the harbor 
with Gerard. Afterward, Benedict 
brought me topside through his 
Trump. Back in my rooms, I found 
a note which apparently had been 
slipped in under the door. It re- 
quested a private meeting, later in 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN

the afternoon, at the Grove of the 
Unicorn. It was signed ‘Caine’.” 
“Have you still got the note?” 
“Yes.” I dug it out of my pocket 
and passed it to him. “Here.” 

. He studied it and shook his head. 

“I don’t know,” he said. “It 
could be his writing — if he were in a 
hurry — but I don’t think it is.” 

I shrugged. I took the note back, 
folded it, put it away. 

"Whatever, I tried to reach him 
with his Trump, to save myself the 
ride. But he wasn’t receiving. I 
guessed it was to maintain secrecy 
as to his whereabouts, if it was all 
that important. So I got a horse 
and rode on down." 

“Did you tell anyone where you 
were going?” 

“Not a soul. I did decide to give 
the horse a workout, though, so I 
rode along at a pretty good clip. I 
didn’t see it happen, but 1 saw him 
lying there as I came into the wood. 
His throat had been cut, and there 
was a disturbance off in the bushes 
some distance away. I rode the guy 
down, jumped him, fought with 
him, had to kill him. We didn’t 
engage in any conversation while 
this was going on.” 

“You’re sure you got the right 
guy?” 

“As sure as you can be under 
such circumstances. His trail went 
back to Caine. He had fresh blood 
on his garments.” 

“Might have been his own.” 
“Look again. No wounds. I 
broke his neck. Of course I remem- 
bered where I had seen his like be- 
fore. so I brought him right to you. 
Before you tell me about it though, 
there was one more thing — just for 
a clincher.” I withdrew the second 



note, passed it over. “The creature 
had this on its person. I presume it 
had removed it from Caine.” 

Random read it, nodded and 
handed it back. 

"From you, to Caine, asking to 
be met there. Yes, I see. Needless 
to say . .” 

“Needless to say,” I finished. 
“And it does look a bit like my 
writing — at first glance, anyway.” 

“1 wonder what would have 
happened if you had gotten there 
first?” 

“Probably nothing,” 1 said. 
“Alive and looking bad — that 
seems how they wanted me. The 
trick was to get us there in the 
proper order, and I didn’t hurry 
quite enough to miss what is bound 
to follow." 

He nodded. 

“Granting the tight scheduling,” 
he said, “it had to be someone on 
the scene, here in the palace. Any 
ideas?” 

I chuckled and reached for a 
cigarette. I lit it and chuckled 
again. 

“I’m just back. You have been 
here all along,” I said. “Which one 
hates me the most these days?” 

“That is an embarrassing ques- 
tion, Corwin,” he stated. “Every- 
one’s down on you for something. 
Ordinarily, I would nominate 
Julian. Only it doesn’t seem to hold 
up here.” 

“Why not?” 

“He and Caine got along very 
well. For years now. They had been 
looking out for each other, hanging 
around together. Pretty thick. 
Julian is cold and petty and just as 
nasty as you remember. But if he 
liked anybody, he liked Caine. I

don't think he’d do it to him, not 
even to get at you. After all, he 
could probably have found plenty 
of other ways if that was all he 
wanted.” 

I sighed. 

“Who’s next?" 

“1 don’t know. I just don’t 
know.” 

“Okay. How do you read the re- 
actions to this?” 

“You’re screwed, Corwin. Every- 
one is going to think you did it, no 
matter what you say.” 

I nodded at the corpse. Random 
shook his head. 

“That could easily be some poor 
clod you dug up out of Shadow to 
take the blame.” 

"I know,” 1 said. “Funny, 
coming back to Amber as I did, I 
arrived at an ideal time for posi- 
tioning myself advantageously.” 

“A perfect time,” Random 
agreed. “You didn't even have to 
kill Eric to get what you wanted. 
That was a stroke of luck.” 

“Yes. Still, it is no secret that 
(hat is what I came to do, and it is 
only a matter of time before my 
l roops — foreign, specially armed 
and quartered here — are going to 
start provoking some very bad feel- 
ings. Only the presence of an ex- 
lernal threat has saved me from 
that so far. And then there are the 
things I am suspected of having 
done before my return — like 
murdering Benedict’s retainers. 
Now this . .” 

“Yes," Random said, “I saw it 
coming as soon as you told me. 
When you and Bleys attacked years 
ago, Gerard deployed part of the 
lleet so that it was out of your way. 
Caine, on the other hand, engaged

Lots of delectable items on the science- 
fiction list this month . great for gifts 
and/or for holiday reading. The wags tell 
us that December is a so-so month for 
book sales. But we’re betting a bundle 
that our decern ber goodies will be 
grabbed up so fast they’ll be back for 
second printings before the turn of the 
year. So don’t wait for the books to dis- 
appear off the shelves . get your 
copies now . and beat the rush! 

Baiian tine’s special of the month is an 
old friend wrapped up in a spariding new 
package. One of the first books the 
house published when it opened shop 
more than 20 years ago was THE SPACE 
MERCHANTS by Frederik Pohl and C. 
M. Kornbluth. That book [#21 in a list 
that numbers well over 4000] was an in- 
stant success and has since become 
something of a classic in the field. Now, 
we find, more and more people are read- 
ing science fiction . only they don’t 
know they’re reading science fiction. So 
we believe the mass market is finally 
ready for THE SPACE MERCHANTS 
[“A novel of the future that the present 
must inevitably rank as a classic.” — NY 
Times], and we are backing that belief 
with a substantia! initial printing and 
with the kind ad and promotion cam- 
paign usually reserved for BIG best- 
sellers. Here’s the book to give someone 
who doesn’t know he/she likes science 
fiction ... on sale wherever paperbacks 
are sold.

John W. Campbell became the editor 
of Astounding Science Fiction in 1937. 
Within two years he was recognized by 
nearly all readers as the greatest editor 
the field had ever grown — a reputation 
he maintained for more than 30 years. 
When Campbell died in 1971, Harry 
Harrison asked the writers most closely 
associated with Astounding to contribute 
brand new stories of the kind that had

made that magazine #1 In the Geld. And 
so we present ASTOUNDING: John W. 
Campbell Memorial Anthology, edited 
by Harry Harrison. Sure to be a 
collector’s item, this anthology is com- 
pletely and inimitably illustrated by 
Kelly Frees [who else?].

Leigh Brackett Is best known for her 
swashbuckling heroic adventures featur- 
ing Eric John Stark. But she has also 
written what we think is one of the finest 
post-holocaust novels ever: The Long To- 
morrow — when men of science fall into 
disgrace and technology Is against the 
law . when the 30th Amendment to 
the Constitution says: “No city, no town, 
no community of more than one thou- 
sand people or two hundred buildings to 
the square mile, shall be built or per- 
mitted to exist anywhere in the United 
States of America.” 

“By far Leigh Brackett’s best 
novel ... a greet work of science fic- 
tion,” said the NY Times- — and we cer- 
tainly do agree! 



Next month we’ll have a wrap-up on 
*74 and a look ahead to *75, a year that 
promises to be super for science fiction 
here at Ballantine.

you with his vessels and scuttled 
you. Now that he is gone, I imagine 
you will put Gerard in command of 
the entire fleet.” 

“Who else? He is the only man 
for the job.” 

“Nevertheless . .” 
“Nevertheless. Admitted. If I 
were going to kill any one person to 
strengthen my position, Caine 
would be the logical choice. That’s 
the real, damning truth.” 

“How do you propose handling 
this?” 

“Tell everyone what happened 
and try to discover who was behind 
it. Any better suggestions?” 

“I’ve been trying to think how I 
could alibi you. But it does not look 
promising.” 

I shook my head. 

“You are too close to me. No 
matter how good we made it sound, 
it would probably have the opposite 
effect.” 

“Have you considered admitting 
to it?” 

“Yes. But self-defense is out. 
With a cut throat, it had to be a 
matter of surprise. And I have no 
stomach for starting off with the 
alternative: hoke up some evidence 
he was up to something rotten and 
say I did it for the good of Amber. I 
flatly refuse to take on fake guilt 
under those terms. I’d wind up with 
a bad odor that way, too.” 

“But with a real tough reputa- 
tion.” 

“It’s the wrong kind of tough for 
the sort of show I want to run. No, 
that’s out.” 

“That covers everything, then — 
just about.” 

“What do you mean ‘just 
about’?”

He studied his left thumbnail 
through slitted eyes. 

“Well, it occurs to me that if 
there is anyone else you are anxious 
to get out of the picture, now is the 
time to consider that a frame can 
often be shifted.” 

1 thought about it and finished 
my cigarette. 

“Not bad,” I said, “but I can’t 
spare any more brothers at the 
moment. Not even Julian. Anyhow, 
he’s the least frameable.” 

“It need not be family,” he said. 
“Plenty of noble Amberites around 
with possible motives. Take Sir 
Reginald — ” 

“Forget it. Random! The re- 
framing is out, too.” 

“Okay. I’ve exhausted my little 
gray cells, then.” 

“Not the ones in charge of 
memory, 1 hope.” 

“All right.” 

He sighed. He stretched. He got 
to his feet, stepped over the room's 
other occupant and made his way 
to the window. Drawing back the 
drapes, he stared out for a time. 

“All right,” he repeated. 
“There’s a lot to tell . .” 

Then Random remembered out 
loud and at length .

«t|7hile sex heads a great 
yy number of lists, we all have 
other things we like to do in be- 
tween. With me, Corwin, it’s 
drumming, being up in the air and 
gambling — in no special order. 
Well, maybe soaring has a little 
edge — in gliders, balloons and cer- 
tain variations — but mood has a lot 



to do with that too, you know. I 
mean, ask me another time and I 
might say one of the others. De- 
pends on what I want most at the 
moment. 

Anyway, I was here in Amber 
some years ago. Not doing much of 
anything. Just visiting and being a 
nuisance. Dad was still around, 
and when I noticed that he was 
getting into one of his grumpy 
moods, I decided it was time to 
take a walk. A long one. I had often 
noticed that his fondness for me 
tended to increase as an inverse 
function of my proximity. He gave 
me a fancy riding crop for a going- 
away present — to hasten the 

process of affection, I suppose. 
Still, it was a very nice crop — 
silver-chased, beautifully tooled — 
and I made good use of it. I had de- 
cided to go looking for an assemb- 
lage of all my simple pleasures in 
one small nook of Shadow. 

It was a long ride — I will not bore 
you with the details — and it was 
pretty far from Amber, as such 
things go. This time, I was not 
looking for a place where 1 would 
be especially important. That can 
get either boring or difficult fairly 
quickly, depending on how respon- 
sible you want to be. I wanted to be 
an irresponsible nonentity and just 
enjoy myself. 

Texorami was a wide open port 
city, with sultry days and long 
nights, lots of good music, gamb- 
ling around the clock, duels every 
morning and in-between mayhem 
for those who couldn’t wait. And 
the air currents were fabulous. I 
had a little red sail plane I used to 
go sky surfing in, every couple 
days. It was the good life. I played

drums till all hours in a basement 
spot up the river where the walls 
sweated almost as much as the 
customers and the smoke used to 
wash around the lights like streams 
of milk. When I was done playing 
I’d go find some action, women or 
cards usually. And that was it for 
the rest of the night. Damn Eric, 
anyway! That reminds me again . 
He once accused me of cheating at 
cards, did you know that? And 
that’s about the only thing I 
wouldn’t cheat at. 1 take my card 
playing seriously. I’m good and I’m 
also lucky. Eric was neither. The 
trouble with him was that he was 
good at so many things he wouldn’t 
admit even to himself there were 
some things other people could do 
better. If you kept beating him at 
anything you had to be cheating. 
He started a nasty argument over it 
one night — could have gotten 
serious — but Gerard and Caine 
broke it up. Give Caine that. He 
took my part that time. Poor 
guy ... Hell of a way to go, you 
know? His throat . Well. Any- 
how. there 1 was in Texorami, mak- 
ing music and women, winning at 
cards and jockeying around the 
sky. Palm trees and night-blooming 
wallflowers. Lots of good port 
smells— spices, coffee, tar, salt — 
you know. Gentlefolk, merchants 
and peons — the same straights as 
in most other places. Sailors and 
assorted travelers passing in and 
out. Guys like me living around the 
edges of things. I spent a little over 
two years in Texorami, happy. 
Really. Not much contact with 
the others. Sort of postcard-like 
hellos via the Trumps every now 
and then, and that was about it. 



Amber was pretty much off nty 
mind. All this changed one night 
when I was sitting there with a full 
house and the guy across from me 
was trying to make up his mind 
whether or not I was bluffing. 

The Jack of Diamonds began 
talking to me. 

Yes, that is how it started. I was 
in a weird frame of mind anyway. 
1 had just finished a couple very hot 
sets and was still kind of high. 
Also, I was physically strung out, 
from a long day’s gliding and not 
much sleep the night before. I de- 
cided later that it must be our 
mental quirk associated with the 
Trumps that make me see it that 
way when someone was trying to 
reach me and I had cards in my 
hand — any cards. Ordinarily, of 
course, we get the message empty- 
handed, unless we are doing the 
calling. It could have been that my 
subconscious — which was kind of 
footloose at the time — just seized 
on the available props out of habit. 
Later, though, I had cause to 
wonder. Really, 1 just don’t know. 

The Jack said, “Random.” Then 
its face blurred and it said, “Help 
me.” 1 began getting a feel of the 
personality by then, but it was 
weak. The whole thing was very 
weak. Then the face rearranged it- 
self and I saw that 1 was right. It 
was Brand. He looked like hell, and 
he seemed to be chained or tied to 
something. “Help me,” he said 
again. 

“I’m here,” I said. “What’s the 
matter?” 

“. Prisoner,” he said, and 
something else that I couldn’t make 
out. 

“Where?” I asked. 



24 



GALAXY 




He shook his head at that. 
“Can’t bring you through,” he 
said. “No Trumps, and I am too 
weak. You will have to come the 
long way around . .” 

I did not ask him how he was 
managing it without my Trump. 
Finding out where he was seemed 
of First importance. I asked him 
how I could locate him. 

“Look very closely,” he said. 
"Remember every feature. I may 
only be able to show you once. 
Come armed, too . .” 

Then 1 saw the landscape — over 
his shoulder, out a window, over a 
battlement — I can’t be sure. It was 
far from Amber, somewhere where 
the shadows go mad. Farther than I 
like to go. Stark, with shifting 
colors. Fiery. Day without a sun in 
the sky. Rocks that glided like sail- 
boats across the land. Brand there 
in some sort of tower — a small 
point of stability in that flowing 
scene. I remembered it, all right. 
And 1 remembered the presence 
coiled about the base of that tower. 
Brilliant. Prismatic. Some sort of 
watch-thing, it seemed — too bright 
for me to make out its outline, to 
guess its proper size. Then it all just 
went away. Instant off. And there I 
was, staring at the Jack of Dia- 
monds again, with the guy across 
from me not knowing whether to be 
mad at my long distraction or con- 
cerned that I might be having some 
sort of sick spell. 

I closed up shop with that hand 
and went home. I lay stretched 
out on my bed, smoking and think- 
ing. Brand had still been in Amber 
when I had departed. Later 
though, when I had asked after 



him, no one had any idea as to his 
whereabouts. Fie had been having 
one of his melancholy spells, had 
snapped out of it one day and 
ridden off. And that was that. No 
messages either — either way. He 
wasn’t answering, he wasn’t 
talking. 

1 tried to figure every angle. He 
was smart, damn smart. Possibly 
the best mind in the family. He was 
in trouble and he had called me. 
Eric and Gerard were more the 
heroic types and would probably 
have welcomed the adventure. 
Caine would have gone out of curi- 
osity. 1 think. Julian, to look better 
than the rest of us and to score 
points with Dad. Or, easiest of all, 
Brand could have called Dad him- 
self. Dad would have done some- 
thing about it. But he had called 
me. Why? 

It occurred to me then that 
maybe one or more of the others 
had been responsible for his cir- 
cumstances. If, say. Dad was be- 
ginning to favor him . Well. 
You know. Eliminate the positive. 
And if he did call Dad, he would 
look like a weakling. 

So 1 suppressed my impulse to 
yell for reinforcements. He had 
called me, and it was quite possible 
I would be cutting his throat by 
letting anyone back in Amber in on 
the fact that he had gotten the 
message out. Okay. What was in it 
for me? 

If it involved the succession and 
he had truly become fair-haired, I 
figured that 1 could do a lot worse 
than give him this to remember me 
by. And if it did not . There 
were all sorts of other possibilities. 
Perhaps he had stumbled onto

something going on back home, 
something it would be useful to 
know about. I was even curious as 
to (lie means he had employed for 
bypassing the Trumps. So it was 
curiosity. I'd say, that made me de- 
cide to go it alone and try to rescue 
him. 

I dusted off my own Trumps and 
tried reaching him again. As you 
might expect, there was no re- 
sponse. I got a good night’s sleep 
then and tried one more time in the 
morning. Again, nothing. Okay, no 
sense waiting any longer. 

I cleaned up my blade, ate a big 
meal and got into some rugged 
clothes. I also picked up a pair of 
dark, polaroid goggles. Didn’t 
know how they would work there, 
but that warden-thing had been 
awfully bright— and it never hurts 
to try anything extra you can think 
of. For that matter, I also took a 
gun. I had a feeling it would be 
worthless, and I was right. But, like 
1 said, you never know till you try. 

The only person I said good-by to 
was another drummer, because I 
stopped to give him my set before I 
left. 

Then I went on down to the 
hangar, got the sail plane ready, 
went aloft and caught a proper 
current. It seemed a neat way to do 
it. 

I don't know' whether you've ever 
glided through Shadow, but — No? 
Well, 1 headed out over the sea till 
the land was only a dim line to the 
north. Then 1 had the waters go co- 
balt beneath me, rear up and shake 
sparkly beards. The wind shifted. I 
turned. 1 raced the waves shore- 
ward beneath a darkening sky. 
Texorami was gone when I 



returned to the rivermouth, re- 
placed by miles of swamp. I rode 
the currents inward, crossing and 
recrossing the river at new twists 
and kinks it had acquired. Gone 
were the piers, the trails, the 
traffic. The trees were high. 

Clouds massed in the west, pink 
and pearl and yellow. The sun 
phased from orange through red to 
yellow. You shake your head? The 
sun was the price of the cities, you 
see. In a hurry, I depopulate — or 
rather, go the elemental route. At 
that altitude artifacts would have 
been distracting. Shading and tex- 
ture becomes everything for me. 
That’s what I meant about gliding 
it being a bit different. 

So, I bore to the west till the 
woods gave way to surface green, 
lightening the while, dispersing, 
breaking to brown, tan, yellow. 
Light and crumbly then, splotched. 
The price of that was a storm. I 
rode it out, as much as I could, till 
(he lightnings forked nearby and I 
feared that the gusts were getting to 
be too much for the little glider. 1 
toned it down fast then, but got 
more green below as a result. Still, 
1 pulled it out of the storm with a 
yellow sun firm and bright at my 
back. After a time, I got it to go 
desert beneath me again, stark and 
rolling. 

Then the sun shrank and strands 
of cloud whipped past its face, 
erasing it bit by bit. That was the 
shortcut that took me farther from 
Amber than I had been in a long 
while. 

No sun then, but the light re- 
mained, just as bright but eerie 
now, directionless. It tricked my 
eyes, it screwed up perspective. I

dropped lower, limiting my range 
of vision. Soon large rocks came 
into view, and 1 fought for the 
shapes I remembered. Gradually, 
these occurred. 

The buckling, flowing effect was 
easier to achieve under these condi- 
tions. but its production was physi- 
cally disconcerting. It made it even 
more difficult to judge my effective- 
ness in guiding the glider. I got 
lower than I thought I was and al- 
most collided with one of the rocks. 
Finally, though, the smokes rose 
and flames danced about as 1 
remembered them — conforming to 
no particular pattern, just emerg- 
ing here and there from crevasses, 
holes, cave mouths. Colors began 
to misbehave as I remembered 
from my brief view. Then came the 
actual motion of the rocks — drift- 
ing. sailing, like rudderless boats in 
a place where they wring out rain- 
bows. 

By then, the air currents had 
gone crazy. One updraft after an- 
other, like fountains. I fought them 
as best I could, but knew 1 could 
not hold things together much 
longer at that altitude. 1 rose a con- 
siderable distance, forgetting every- 
thing for a time while trying to 
stabilize the craft. When 1 looked 
down again, it was like viewing a 
freeform regatta of black icebergs. 
The rocks were racing around, 
clashing together, backing off, 
colliding again, spinning, arcing 
across the open spaces, passing 
among one another. Then I was 
slammed about, forced down, 
forced up — and 1 saw a strut give 
way. I gave the shadows their final 
nudge, then looked again. The 
tower had appeared in the distance. 



something brighter than ice or 
aluminum stationed at its base. 

T hat final push had done it. I 
realized that just as I felt the 
winds start a particularly nasty 
piece of business. Then several 
cables snapped and I was on my 
way down — like riding a waterfall. 
1 got the nose up, brought it in low 
and wild, saw where we were head- 
ed and jumped at the last moment. 
The poor glider was pulverized by 
one of those peripatetic monoliths. 
I felt worse about that than I did 
about the scrapes, rips and lumps 1 
collected. 

Then 1 had to move quickly, be- 
cause a hill was racing toward me. 
We both veered, fortunately in 
different directions. 1 hadn’t the 
faintest notion as to their motive 
force, and at first 1 could see no 
pattern to their movements. The 
ground varied from warm to ex- 
tremely hot underfoot, and along 
with the smoke and occasional jets 
of llame, nasty smelling gases were 
escaping from numerous openings 
in the ground. 1 hurried toward the 
tower, following a necessarily ir- 
regular course. 

It took a long while to cover the 
distance. Just how long, 1 was un- 
certain, as I had no way of keeping 
track of the time. By then, though, 
I was beginning to notice some 
interesting regularities. First, the 
larger stones moved at a greater 
velocity than the smaller ones. 
Second, they seemed to be orbiting 
one another — cycles within cycles 
w ithin cycles, larger about smaller, 
none of them ever still. Perhaps the 
prime mover was a dust mote or a 
single molecule — somewhere. I had 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



27 




neither time nor desire to indulge in 
any attempt to determine the center 
of the affair. Keeping this in mind, 
I did manage to observe as I went, 
though, enough so that 1 was able 
to anticipate a number of their 
collisions well in advance. 

So Childe Random to the dark 
tower came, yeah, gun in one hand, 
blade in the other. The goggles 
hung about my neck. With all the 
smoke and confused lighting, I 
wasn’t about to don them until it 
became absolutely necessary. 

Now, whatever the reason, the 
rocks avoided the tower. While it 
seemed to stand on a hill, 1 realized 
as I approached that it would be 
more correct to say that the rocks 
had scooped out an enormous basin 
just short of it. I could not tell from 
my side, however, whether the 
effect was that of an island or a 
peninsula. 

I dashed through the smoke and 
rubble, avoiding the jets of flame 
that leapt from the cracks and 
holes. Finally, 1 scrambled up the 
slope, removing myself from the 
courseway. Then, for several 
moments, 1 clung at ~. spot just be- 
low any line of sight from the tower. 
I checked my weapons, controlled 
my breathing and put on the 
goggles. Everything set, I went over 
the top and came up into a crouch. 

Yes. the shades worked. And 
yes, the beast was waiting. 

It was a fright all right, because 
in some ways it was kind of beauti- 
ful. It had a snake body as big 
around as a barrel, with a head sort 
of like a massive claw hammer, but 
kind of tapered to the snout end. 
Eyes of a very pale green. And it 
was clear as glass, with very faint. 



line lines seeming to indicate 
scales. Whatever flowed in its veins 
was reasonably clear, also. You 
could look right into it and see its 
organs — opaque or cloudy as the 
case might be. You could almost be 
distracted by watching the thing 
function. And it had a dense mane, 
like bristles of glass — about the 
head and collaring its gullet. Its 
movement when it saw me, raised 
that head and slithered forward, 
was like flowing water — living 
water it seemed, a bedless river 
without banks. What almost froze 
me, though, was that I could see 
into its stomach. There was a partly 
digested man in it. 

1 raised the gun, aimed at the 
nearest eye and squeezed the 
trigger. 

1 already told you it didn’t work. 
So I threw the gun, leaped to my 
left and sprang in on its right side, 
going for its eye with my blade. 

You know how hard it can be to 
kill things built along reptilian 
lines. I decided immediately to try 
to blind the thing and hack off its 
tongue as the first order of 
business. Then, being more than a 
little fast on my feet, 1 might have 
any number of chances to lay in 
some good ones about the head 
until I decapitated it. Then let it tie 
itself in knots till it stopped. 1 was 
hoping, too, that it might be 
sluggish because it was still digest- 
ing someone. 

If it was sluggish then, I was glad 
that I hadn’t stopped by earlier. It 
drew its head out of the path of my 
blade and snapped down over it 
while I was still off balance. That 
snout glanced across my chest, and 
it felt as if I had been hit by a 



28 



GALAXY 




massive hammer. It knoeked me 
sprawling. 

1 kept on rolling to get out of 
range, coming up short near the 
edge of the embankment. I recover- 
ed my footing there while it un- 
wound itself, dragged a lot of 
weight in my direction and then 
reared up and cocked its head 
again, about fifteen feet above me. 

1 know damn well Gerard would 
have chosen that moment to attack. 
The big bastard would have strode 
forward with that monster blade of 
his and cut the thing in half. Then 
it would probably have fallen on 
him and writhed all over him, and 
he'd have come away with a few 
bruises. Maybe a bloody nose. 
Benedict would not have missed the 
eye. He would have had one in each 
pocket by then and be playing foot- 
ball with the head while composing 
a footnote to Clausewitz. But they 
are genuine hero types. Me, 1 just 
stood there holding the blade point 
upward, both hands on the hilt, my 
elbows on my hips, my head as far 
back out of the way as possible. 1 
would much rather have run and 
called it a day. Only I knew that if I 
tried it, that head would drop down 
and smear me. 

Cries from within the tower indi- 
cated that I had been spotted, but I 
was not about to look away to see 
what was going on. Then I began 
cursing the thing. I wanted it to 
strike and get it over with, one way 
or the other. 

When it finally did, I shuffled my 
lect, twisted my body and swung 
the point into line with my target. 

My left side was partly numbed 
by the blow, and I felt as if 1 had 
been driven a foot into the ground.

Somehow, I managed to remain 
upright. Yes, I had done everything 
perfectly. The maneuver had gone 
exactly as I had hoped and 
planned. 

Except for the beast’s part. It 
wasn’t cooperating by producing 
the appropriate death throes. 

In fact, it was beginning to rise. 

It took my blade with it, too. The 
hilt protruded from its left eye 
socket, the point emerged like 
another bristle amid the mane on 
the back of its head. I had a feeling 
that the offensive team had had it. 

At that moment, figures began to 
em erge — slow ly , ca u t iou sly — from 
an opening at the base of the tower. 
They were armed and ugly looking, 
and I had a feeling that they were 
not on my side of the disagreement. 

Okay. I know when it is time to 
fold and hope for a better hand 
another day. 

“Brand!” I shouted. “It’s 
Random! I can’t get through! 
Sorry!” 

Then I turned, ran and leaped 
back over the edge, down into the 
place where the rocks did their un- 
settling things. 1 wondered whether 
1 had chosen the best time to 
descend. 

Like so many things, the answer 
was yes and no. 

|t was not the sort of jump I 
I would make for many reasons 
other than those which prevailed. I 
came down alive, but that seemed 
(he most that could be said for it. I 
was stunned, and for a long while I 
thought I had broken my ankle. 

The thing that got me moving 
again was a rustling sound from 
above and the rattle of gravel about 



me. When 1 readjusted the goggles 
and looked up, I saw that the beast 
had decided to come down and 
finish the job. It was winding its 
phantom way down the slope, the 
area about its head having darken- 
ed and opaqued since I had skewer- 
ed it upstairs. 

1 sat up. 1 got to my knees. I tried 
my ankle, couldn’t use it. Nothing 
around to serve as a crutch either. 
Okay. 1 crawled then. Away. What 
else was there to do? Gain as much 
ground as I could and think hard 
while I was about it. 

Salvation was a rock — one of the 
smaller, slower ones, only about the 
size of a moving van. When I saw it 
approaching, it occurred to me that 
here was transportation if I could 
make it aboard. Maybe some 
safety, too. The faster, really 
massive ones appeared to get the 
most abuse. 

This in mind, I watched the big 
ones that accompanied my own, es- 
timated their paths and velocities, 
tried to gauge the movement of the 
entire system, readied myself for 
the moment, the effort. I also 
listened to the approach of the 
beast, heard the cries of the troops 
from the edge of the bluff, 
wondered w'hether anyone up there 
was giving odds on me and what 
they might be if they were. 

When the time came I went. 1 got 
past the first big one without any 
trouble, but had to wait for the next 
one to go by. I took a chance in 
crossing the path of the final one. 
Had to, to make it in time. 

I made it to the right spot at the 
right moment, caught on to the 
holds I had been eyeing and was 
dragged maybe twenty feet before I 



30 



GALAXY 




could pull myself up off the 
ground. Then 1 hauled my way to 
ils uncomfortable top, sprawled 
(here and looked back. 

It had been close. Still was, for 
that matter, as the beast was 
pacing me, its one good eye follow- 
ing the spinning big ones. 

From overhead, 1 heard a disap- 
pointed wail. Then the guys started 
down the slope, shouting what I 
took to be encouragement to the 
creature. 1 commenced massaging 
my ankle. 1 tried to relax. The 
brute crossed over, passing behind 
the first big rock as it completed 
another orbit. 

How far could 1 shift through 
Shadow before it reached me? I 
wondered. True, there was con- 
stant movement, a changing of tex- 
tures . 

The thing waited for the second 
rock . slithered by behind it, paced 
me again, drew nearer. 

Shadow, Shadow, on the 
wing . 

The men w ere almost to the base 
of the slope by then. The beast was 
waiting for its opening — the next 
time around — past the inner satel- 
lite. 1 knew that it was capable of 
rearing high enough to snatch me 
from my perch . 

. Come alive and smear that 
thing / 

as i spun and glided, I caught 
hold of the stuff of Shadow, 
sank into the feel of it, worked with 
the textures, possible to probable to 
actual, felt it coming with the finest 
twist, gave it that necessary fillip at 
the appropriate moment . 

It came in from the beast’s blind 
side, of course. A big mother of a 



rock, careening along like a semi 
out of control . 

It would have been more elegant 
to mash it between two of them. 
However. I hadn’t the time for 
luiessc. I simply ran it over and left 
it there, thrashing in the granite 
traffic. 

Moments later, however, inex- 
plicably, the mashed and mangled 
body rose suddenly above the 
ground and drifted skyward, twist- 
ing. It kept going, buffeted by the 
winds, dwindling, dwindling, gone. 

My own rock bore me away, 
slowly, steadily. The entire pattern 
was drifting. The guys from the 
lower then went into a huddle and 
decided to pursue me. They moved 
away from the base of the slope, 
began to make their way across the 
plain. But this was no real prob- 
lem, 1 felt. I would ride my stony 
mount through Shadow, leaving 
them worlds away. This was by far 
the easiest course of action open to 
me. They would doubtless have 
been more difficult to take by sur- 
prise than the beast. After all, this 
was their land; they were wary and 
unmaimed. 

1 removed the goggles and tested 
my ankle once more. I stood for a 
moment. It was very sore, but it 
bore my weight. 1 reclined once 
more and turned my thoughts to 
what had occurred. 1 had lost my 
blade and I was now in less than 
top shape. Rather than go on with 
the venture under these conditions, 

1 knew that I was doing the safest, 
w isest thing by getting the hell out. 

1 had gained enough knowledge of 
the layout and the conditions so 
that my. chances would be better 
next time around. All right .

The sky brightened above me, 
the colors and shadings lost 
something of their arbitrary, 
meandering habit. The flames 
began to subside about me. Good. 
Clouds started to find their ways 
across the sky. Excellent. Soon a 
localized glow began behind a 
cloudbank. Superb. When it went 
away, a sun would hang once again 
in the heavens. 

1 looked back and was surprised 
to see that I was still being pursued. 
However, it could easily be that 1 
had not dealt properly with their 
analogues for this slice of Shadow. 
It is never good to assume that you 
have taken care of everything when 
you are in a hurry. So . 

I shifted again. The rock 
gradually altered its course, shifted 
its shape, lost its satellites, moved 
in a straight line toward what was 
to become the west. Above me, the 
clouds dispersed and a pale sun 
shone dou n. We picked up speed. 
That should have taken care of 
everything right there. 1 had posi- 
tively come into a different place. 

But it had not. When I looked 
again, they were still coming. True, 
1 had gained some distance on 
them. But the party trooped right 
along alter me. 

Well, all right. Things like that 
can sometimes happen. There were 
of course two possibilities. My 
mind still being more than a little 
disturbed from all that had just 
occurred, I had not performed 
ideally and had drawn them along 
with me. Or, I had maintained a 
constant where I should have sup- 
pressed a variable — that is. shifted 
into a place and unconsciously re- 
quired that the pursuit element be 



present. Different guys then, but 
still chasing me. 

I rubbed my ankle some more. 
The sun brightened toward orange. 
A wind out of the north raised a 
screen of dust and sand and hung it 
at my back, removing the gang 
from my sight. 1 raced on into the 
west, where a line of mountains had 
now grown up. Time was in a dis- 
tortion phase. My ankle felt a little 
better. 

I rested awhile. Mine was reason- 
ably comfortable, as rocks go. No 
sense turning it into a hellride w'hen 
everything seemed to be proceeding 
smoothly. I stretched out, hands 
behind my head, and watched the 
mountains draw nearer. 1 th 'Ught 
about Brand and the tower. That 
was the place all right. Everything 
was just as it had been in the 
glimpse he had given me. Except 
for the guards, of course. I decided 
that I would cut through the proper 
piece of Shadow, recruit a cohort of 
my own, then go back and give 
them hell. Yes, then everything 
would be line . 

After a time, 1 stretched, rolled 
over onto my stomach and looked 
back. Damned if they weren’t still 
following me! They had even 
gained some. 

Naturally, 1 got angry. To hell 
with flight! They were asking for it, 
and it was time they got it. 

1 rose to my feet. My ankle was 
only half-sore, a little numb. I 
raised my arms and looked for the 
shadows I wanted. 1 found them. 

S lowly, the rock swung out 
from its straight course into an 
arc. turning off to the right. The 
curve tightened. I swung through a 



32 



GALAXY 




parabola and headed back toward 
them, my velocity gradually in- 
creasing as 1 went. No time to raise 
a storm at my back, though 1 
thought that would have been a 
nice touch if I could have managed 
it. 

As I swept down upon them — 
there w r ere maybe two dozen — they 
prudently began to scatter. A 
number of them didn’t make it, 
though. I swung through another 
curve and returned as soon as I 
could. 

I was shaken by the sight of 
several corpses rising into the air, 
dripping gore, two of them already 
high above me. 

1 was almost upon them on that 
second pass when 1 realized that a 
few of them had jumped aboard the 
first time through. The first one 
over the edge drew his blade and 
rushed me. I blocked his arm, took 
the weapon away from him and 
threw him back down. I guess it 
was then that I became aware of 
those spurs on the backs of their 
hands. I had been slashed by his. 

By that time, 1 was the target of a 
number of curiously shaped 
missiles from below, two more guys 
were coming over the edge and it 
looked as if several more might 
have made it aboard below. 

Well, even Benedict sometimes 
retreats. I had at least given the 
survivors something to remember. 

1 let go the shadows, tore a 
barbed wheel from my side, an- 
other from my thigh, hacked off a 
guy’s swordarm and kicked him in 
the stomach, dropped to my knees 
to avoid a wild swing from the next 
guy and caught him across the legs 
with my riposte. He went over, too. 



There were five more on the way 
up and we were sailing westward 
once again, leaving perhaps a 
dozen live ones to regroup on the 
sand at my back, a sky full of 
oozing drifters above them. 

1 had the advantage with the next 
fellow because 1 caught him just 
partway over the edge. So much for 
him, and then there were four. 

While I had been dealing with 
him though, three more had arisen, 
simultaneously, at three different 
points. 

1 rushed the nearest and dis- 
patched him, but the other two 
made it over and were upon me 
while I was about it. As I defended 
myself from their attack, the final 
one came up and joined them. 

They were not all that good, but 
it was getting crowded and there 
were a lot of points and sharp edges 
straying about me. I kept parrying 
and moving, trying to get them to 
block one another, get in each 
other’s way. I was partly successful, 
and when I had the best lineup I 
thought I was going to get, 1 rushed 
them, taking a couple cuts — I had 
to lay myself open a bit to do 
it — but splitting one skull for my 
pains. He. went over the edge and 
took the second one with him in a 
tangle of limbs and gear. 

Unfortunately, the inconsiderate 
lout had carried off my blade, 
snagged in some boney cleft or 
other he had chosen to interpose 
when I swung. It was obviously my 
day for losing blades, and I 
wondered if my horoscope would 
have mentioned it if I had thought 
to look before I’d set out. 

Anyhow, I moved quickly to 
avoid the final guy’s swing. In 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



33 




doing so, I slipped on some blood 
and went skidding toward the front 
of the rock. If I went down that 
way, it would plow right over me, 
leaving a very flat Random there, 
like an exotic rug, to puzzle and de- 
light future wayfarers. 

1 clawed for handholds as I slid, 
and the guys took a couple quick 
steps toward me, raising his blade 
to do unto me as I had his buddy. 

1 caught hole of his ankle 
though, and it did the trick of brak- 
ing me very nicely — and damned if 
someone shouldn’t choose that 
moment to try to get hold of me via 
the Trumps. 

“I’m busy!” I shouted. “Call 
back later!” and my own motion 
was arrested as the guy toppled, 
clattered and went sliding by. 

1 tried to reach him before he fell 
to rugdom, but I was not quite 
quick enough. I had wanted to save 
him for questioning. Still, my un- 
egged beer was more than satis- 
factory. I headed back top and 
center to observe and muse. 

The survivors were still following 
me, but I had a sufficient lead. I 
did not at the moment have to 
worry about another boarding 
party. Good enough. I was headed 
toward the mountains once again. 
The sun I had conjured was be- 
ginning to bake me. I was soaked 
with sweat and blood. My wounds 
were giving me trouble. I was 
thirsty. Soon, soon, I decided, it 
would have to rain. Take care of 
that before anything else. 

So 1 began the preliminaries to a 
shift in that direction: clouds 

massing behind the mountains, 
building, darkening . 

I drifted off somewhere along the 



line, had a disjointed dream of 
someone trying to reach me again 
but not making it. Sweet darkness. 

S awakened to the rain, sudden 
and hard-driving. I could not 
1 w hether the darkness in the sky 
was from storm, evening or both. It 
was cooler, though, and I spread 
my cloak and just lay there with my 
mouth open. Periodically, 1 wrung 
moisture from the cloak. My thirst 
was eventually slaked and I began 
feeling clean again. The rock had 
also become so slick-looking that I 
was afraid, to move about on it. The 
mountains were much nearer, their 
peaks lined by frequent lightnings. 
Things were too dark in the oppo- 
site direction for me to tell whether 
my pursuers were still with me. It 
would have been pretty rough 
trekking for them to have kept up, 
but then it is seldom good policy to 
rely on assumptions when traveling 
through strange shadows. I was a 
bit irritated with myself for going to 
sleep, but since no harm had come 
of it I drew' my soggy cloak about 
me and decided to forgive myself. I 
felt around for some cigarettes I 
had brought along and found that 
about half of them had survived. 
After the eighth try, 1 juggled 
shadows just enough to get a light. 
Then I just sat there, smoking and 
being rained on. It was a good feel- 
ing and I didn’t move to change 
anything else, not for hours. 

When the storm finally let up 
and the sky came clear, it w'as a 
night full of strange constellations. 
Beautiful though, the way nights 
can be on the desert. Much later, 1 
detected a gentle upward sloping 
and my rock began to slow. Some- 



34 



GALAXY 




Ihing began to happen in ternis of 
whatever physical rules controlled 
the situation. I mean, the slope it- 
self did not seem so pronounced 
that it would affect our velocity as 
radically as it had. I did not want to 
tamper with Shadow in a direction 
that would probably take me out of 
my way. I wanted to get back onto 
more familiar turf as soon as pos- 
sible — find my way to a place where 
my gut anticipations of physical 
events had more of a chance of 
being correct. 

So I let the rock grind to a halt, 
climbed down when it did and 
continued on up the slope, hiking. 
As 1 went, I played the Shadow 
game we all learned as children. 
Pass some obstruction — a scrawny 
tree, a stand of stone — and have 
the sky be different from one side to 
the other. Gradually, I restored 
familiar constellations. I knew that 
1 would be climbing down a 
different mountain from the one I 
ascended. My wounds still throbbed 
dully, but my ankle had stopped 
bothering me except for a little 
stiffness. 1 was rested. I knew that 1 
could go for a long while. Every- 
thing seemed to be all right again. 

It was a long hike, up the 
gradually steepening way. But I hit 
a trail eventually, and that made 
things easier. I trudged steadily up- 
ward under the now familiar skies, 
determined to keep moving and 
make it across by morning. As I 
went, my garments altered to fit the 
shadow — denim trousers and jacket 
now, my wet cloak a dry serape. I 
heard an owl nearby, and from a 
great distance below and behind 
came what might have been the yip- 
yip-howl of a coyote. These signs of 



a more familiar place made me feel 
somewhat secure, exorcised any 
vestiges of desperation that re- 
mained with my flight. 

An hour or so later, I yielded to 
the temptation to play with Shadow 
just a bit. It was not all that im- 
probable for a stray horse to be 
wandering in these hills, and of 
course 1 found him. After ten or so 
minutes of becoming friendly, I was 
mounted bareback and moving 
tow ard the top of the trail in a more 
congenial fashion. The wind sowed 
frost in our path. The moon came 
and sparked it to life. 

To be brief, I rode all night, 
passing over the crest and com- 
mencing my downward passage 
well before dawn. As I descended, 
the mountain grew even more vast 
above me, which of course was the 
best time for this to occur. Things 
were green on this side of the range, 
and divided by neat highways, 
punctuated by occasional dwellings. 
Everything therefore was proceed- 
ing in accordance with my desire. 

Early morning. 1 was into the 
foothills and my denim had turned 
to Khaki and a bright shirt. I had a 
light sport jacket slung before me. 
At a great height, a jet liner poked 
holes in the air, moving from 
horizon to horizon. There were 
birdsongs about me, and the day 
was mild, sunny. 

It was about then that I heard my 
name spoken and felt the touch of 
the Trump once more. I drew up 
short and responded. 

“Yes?” 

I T WAS JULIAN. 

“Random, where are you?” he 
asked. 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



35 




“Pretty far from Amber,” I re- 
plied. “Why?” 

“Have any of the others been in 
touch with you?” 

“Not recently,” I said. “But 
someone did try to get hold of me 
yesterday. I was busy though, and 
couldn’t talk.” 

“That was me,” he said. “We 
have a situation here that you had 
better know about.” 

“Where are you?” 1 asked. 

“In Amber. A number of things 
have happened recently.” 

"Like what?” 

“Dad has been gone now for an 
unusually long time. No one knows 
where.” 

"He’s done that before.” 

“But not without leaving instruc- 
tions and making delegations. He 
always provided them in the past.” 
“True,” I said. “But how long is 
‘long’?” 

“Well over a year. You weren’t 
aware of this at all?” 

“1 knew that he was gone. 
Gerard mentioned it some time 
back.” 

“Then add more time to that.” 
“I get the idea. How have you 
been operating?” 

“That is the problem. We have 
simply been dealing with affairs as 
they arise. Gerard and Caine had 
been running the navy anyway, on 
Dad’s orders. Without him, they 
have been making all their own de- 
cisions. 1 took charge of the patrols 
in Arden again. There is no central 
authority though, to arbitrate, to 
make policy decisions, to speak for 
all of Amber.” 

“So we need a regent. We can 
cut cards for it, I suppose.” 

“It is not that simple. We think 



Dad is dead.” 

“Dead? Why? How?” 

“We have tried to raise him on 
his Trump. We have been trying 
every day for over half a year now. 
Nothing. What do you think?” 

I nodded. 

“He may be dead,” I said. 
“You’d think he would have come 
across with something. Still, the 
possibility of his being in some 
trouble — say, a prisoner some- 
where — is not precluded.” 

“A cell can’t stop the Trumps. 
Nothing can. He would call for help 
the minute we made contact.” 

“1 can’t argue with that,” I said. 
But I thought of Brand as I said it. 
“Perhaps he is deliberately resist- 
ing contact, though.” 

“What for?” 

“1 have no idea, but it is pos- 
sible. You know how secretive he is 
about some things.” 

“No,” Julian said, “it doesn’t 
hold up. He would have given some 
operating instructions, somewhere 
along the line." 

“Well, whatever the reasons, 
whatever the situation, what do you 
propose doing now?” 

“Someone has to occupy the 
throne,” he said. 

I had seen it coming throughout 
the entire dialogue, of course — the 
opportunity if had long seemed 
would never come to pass. 

“Who?” 1 asked. 

“Eric seems thel>est choice,” he 
replied. “Actually, he has been 
acting in that capacity for months 
now. It simply becomes a matter of 
formalizing it.” 

“Not just as regent?” 

“Not just as regent.” 

“1 see . Yes, I guess that 



36 



GALAXY 




things have been happening in my 
absence. What about Benedict as a 
choice?” 

“He seems to be happy where he 
is, off somewhere in Shadow.” 
“What does he think of the 
whole idea?” 

“He is not entirely in favor of it. 
But we do not believe he will offer 
resistance. It would disrupt things 
too much.” 

“1 see,” I said again. “And 
Bleys?” 

“He and Eric had some rather 
heated discussions of the issue, but 
the troops do not take their orders 
from Bleys. He left Amber about 
three months ago. He could cause 
some trouble later. But then, we 
are forewarned.” 

“Gerard? Caine?” 

“They will go along with Eric. I 
was wondering about yourself?” 
“What about the girls?” 

He shrugged. 

“They tend to take things lying 
down. No problem.” 

“1 don’t suppose Corwin . .” 
“Nothing new. He’s dead. We all 
know it. His monument has been 
gathering dust and ivy for cen- 
turies. If not, then he has inten- 
tionally divorced himself from 
Amber forever. Nothing there. Now 
I am wandering where you stand.” 
I chuckled. 

“I am hardly in a position to 
possess forceful opinions,” I said. 
“We need to know, now.” 

I nodded. 

“1 have always been able to 
detect the quarter of the wind,” I 
said. “I do not sail against it.” 

He smiled and returned my nod. 
“Very good,” he said. 

“When is the coronation? I as- 



sume that I am invited.” 

“Of course, of course. But the 
date has not yet been set. There are 
still a few' minor matters to be dealt 
with. As soon as the affair is 
calendared, one of us will contact 
you again.” 

“Thank you, Julian.” 

“Good-bye for now. Random.” 
And I sat there being troubled 
for a long while before I started on 
downward again. How long had 
Eric spent engineering it? I 
wondered. Much of the politicking 
back in Amber could have been 
done pretty quickly, but the setting 
up of the situation in the first place 
seemed the product of long-term 
thinking and planning. I was 
naturally suspicious as to his 
involvement in Brand’s predica- 
ment. I also could not help but give 
some thought to the possibility of 
his having had a hand in Dad’s dis- 
appearance. That would have 
taken some doing and have re- 
quired a really foolproof trap. But 
the more I thought of it, the less I 
was willing to put it past him. I 
even dredged up some old specula- 
tions as to his part in your own 
passing, Corwin. But offhand, I 
could not think of a single thing to 
do about any of it. Go along with it, 

I figured, if that’s where the power 
was. Stay in his good graces. 

Still . One should always get 
more than one angle on a story. I 
tried to make up my mind as to who 
would give me a good one. While I 
was thinking along these lines, 
something caught my eye as I 
glanced back and up, appreciating 
anew the heights from which I had 
not quite descended. 

There were a number of riders up 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



37 




near the top. They had apparently 
traversed the same trail I had 
taken. 1 could not get an exact nose 
count, but it seemed suspiciously 
close to a dozen — a fairly sizeable 
group to be out riding at just that 
place and time. As I saw that they 
were proceeding on down the same 
way that I had come, I had a 
prickly feeling along the base of my 
neck. What if? What if they were 
the same guys? Because I felt that 
they were. 

Individually, tjiey were no match 
for me. Even a couple of them to- 
gether had not made that great a 
showing. That was not it. The real 
chiller was that if that’s who it was, 
then we were not alone in our 
ability to travel through Shadow. It 
meant that someone else was 
capable of a stunt that for all my 
life I had thought to be the sole 
property of our family. Add to this 
the fact that they were Brand’s 
wardens, and their designs on the 
family — at least part of it — did not 
look all that clement. I perspired 
suddenly at the notion of enemies 
who could match our greatest 
power. 

/\f course, they were too far off 
m_Jfor me to really know just then 
vimether that was truly who it was. 
But you have to explore every con- 
tingency if you want to keep 
winning the survival game. Could 
Eric have found or trained or 
created some special beings to serve 
him in this particular capacity? 
Along with you and Eric, Brand 
had one of the firmest claims on the 
succession. — Not to take anything 
away from your case, damn it! Hell! 
You know what I mean. I have to 



talk about it to show you how I w, 
thinking at the time. That’s all. 
— So, Brand had had the basis for a 
pretty good claim if he had been in 
a position to press it. You being out 
of the picture, he was Eric’s chief 
rival when it came to adding a legal 
touch to things. Putting that to- 
gether with his plight and the 
ability of those guys to traverse 
Shadow, Eric came to look a lot 
more sinister to me. I was more 
scared by that thought than I was 
by the riders themselves, though 
they did not exactly fill me with de- 
light. I decided that I had better do 
several things quickly: talk to 
someone else in Amber, and have 
him take me through the Trump. 

Okay. I decided quickly. Gerard 
seemed the safest choice. He is rea- 
sonably open, neutral. Honest 
about most things. And from what 
Julian had said, Gerard’s role in 
the whole business seemed kind of 
passive. That is, he was not going 
to resist Eric’s move actively. He 
would not want to cause a lot of 
trouble. Didn’t mean he approved. 
He was probably just being safe 
and conservative old Gerard. That 
decided, I reached for my deck of 
Trumps and almost howled. They 
were gone. 

I searched every pocket in every 
garment about me. I had taken 
them along when I'd left Texorami. 
I could have lost them at any point 
in the previous day’s action. I had 
certainly been battered and thrown 
about a lot. And it had been a great 
day for losing things. I composed a 
complicated litany of curses and 
dug my heels into the horse’s sides. 

1 was going to have to move fast 
and think faster now. The first 



38 



GALAXY 




thing would be to get into a nice, 
crowded, civilized place where an 
assassin of the more primitive sort 
would be at a disadvantage. 

As I hurried downhill, heading 
for one of the roads, I worked with 
the stuff of Shadow — quite subtly 
this time, using every bit of skill I 
could muster. There were just two 
things 1 desired at the moment: a 
final assault on my possible 
trackers and a fast path to a place 
of sanctuary. 

The world shimmered and did a 
final jig, becoming the California I 
had been seeking. A rasping, 
growling noise reached my ears, for 
the final touch 1 had intended. 
Looking back, I saw a section of 
cliff face come loose, almost in slow 
motion, and slide directly toward 
the horsemen. Awhile later, I had 
dismounted and was walking in the 
direction of the road, my garments 
even fresher and of better quality. I 
was uncertain as to the time of 
year, and 1 wondered what the 
weather was like in New York. 

Before very long, the bus that I 
had anticipated approached and I 
flagged it down. 1 located a window 
seat, smoked for awhile and 
watched the countryside. After a 
time, I dozed. 

I did not awaken until early 
afternoon, when we pulled into a 
terminal. I was ravenous by then, 
and decided 1 had better have 
something to eat before getting a 
cab for the airport. So I bought 
three cheeseburgers and a couple 
malts wfith a few of my quondam 
Texorami greenbacks. Getting 
served and eating took me maybe 
twenty minutes. Leaving the snack 
bar, I saw that there were a number 



of taxis standing idle at the stand 
out front. Before 1 picked one up” 
though, I decided to make an im- 
portant stop in the men’s room. 

At the very damndest moment 
you can think of, six stalls flew 
open behind my back and their 
occupants rushed me. There was no 
mistaking the spurs on the backs of 
their hands, the oversized jaws, the 
smouldering eyes. Not only had 
they caught up with me, they were 
now clad in the same acceptable 
garb as anyone else in the neighbor- 
hood. Gone were any remaining 
doubts as to their power over 
Shadow. 

Fortunately, one of them was 
faster than the others. Also, 
perhaps because of my size, they 
still might not have been fully 
aware of my strength. I seized that 
first one high up on the arm, avoid- 
ing those hand bayonets he 
sported, pulled him over in front of 
me, picked him up and threw him 
at the others. Then I just turned 
and ran. I broke the door on the 
way out. I didn’t even pause to zip 
up until I w'as in a taxi and had the 
driver burning rubber. 

Enough. It was no longer simple 
sanctuary that I had in mind. I 
wanted to get hold of a set of 
Trumps and tell someone else in 
the family about those guys. If they 
were Eric’s creatures, the others 
ought to be made aware of them. If 
they were not, then Eric ought to be 
told, too. If they could make their 
way through Shadow, perhaps 
others could, also. Whatever they 
represented might one day consti- 
tute a threat to Amber herself. Sup- 
posing — just supposing — that no 
one back home was involved? Whal 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN

if Dad and Brand were the victims 
of a totally unsuspected enemy? 
Then there was something big and 
menacing afoot, and 1 had stepped 
right into it. That would be an ex- 
cellent reason for their hounding 
me this thoroughly. They would 
want me pretty badly. My mind ran 
wild. They might even be harrying 
me toward some sort of a trap. No 
need for the visible ones to be the 
only ones about. 

1 brought my emotions to heel. 
One by one, you must deal with 
those things that come to hand, I 
told myself. That is all. Divorce the 
feelings from the speculations, or at 
least provide for separate mainte- 
nance. This is sister Flora’s 
shadow. She lives on the other edge 
of the continent in a place called 
Westchester. Get to a phone, get 
hold of information and call her. 
Tell her it is urgent and ask for 
sanctuary. She can’t refuse you 
that, even if she does hate your 
guts. Then jump a jet and get the 
hell out there. Speculate on the way 
if you want, but keep cool now. 

So 1 telephoned from the airport 
and you answered it, Corwin. That 
was the variable that broke all the 
possible equations 1 had been 
juggling — you suddenly showing up 
at that time, that place, that point 
in events. I grabbed for it when you 
offered me protection, and not just 
because I wanted protection. I 
could probably have taken those six 
guys out by myself. But that was no 
longer it. I thought they were yours. 

I figured you had been lying low all 
along, waiting for the right moment 
to move in. Now, I thought, you 
were ready. This explains every- 
thing. You had taken out Brand 



and you were about to use your 
Shadow-walking zombies for pur- 
poses of going back and catching 
Eric with his pants down. 1 wanted 
to be on your side because I hated 
Eric and because I knew you were a 
careful planner and you usually get 
what you go after. 1 mentioned the 
pursuit by- guys out of Shadow to 
see what you would say. The fact 
that you said nothing didn’t really 
prove anything, though. Either you 
were being cagey, 1 figured, or you 
had no way of knowing where 1 had 
been. 1 also thought of the possi- 
bility of w'alking into a trap of your 
devising, but I was already in 
trouble and did not see that I was 
that important to the balance of 
power that you would want to dis- 
pose of me. Especially if 1 offered 
my support, which I was quite 
willing to do. So 1 flew on out. And 
damned if those six didn’t board 
later and follow me. Is he giving me 
an escort? I wondered. Better not 
start making more assumptions. I 
shook them again when we landed 
and headed for Flora’s place. Then 
I acted as if none of my guesses had 
occurred, waiting to see what you 
would do. When you helped me dis- 
pose of the guys, I was really 
puzzled. Were you genuinely sur- 
prised, or was it a put-on, with you 
sacrificing a few of the troops to 
keep me ignorant of something? All 
right, I decided, be ignorant, co- 
operate, see what he has in mind. I 
was a perfect setup for that act you 
pulled to cover the condition of 
your memory. When I did learn the 
truth, it was simply too late. We 
were headed for Rebma and none 
of this would have meant anything 
to you. Later, 1 didn’t care to tell 



40 



GALAXY 




Eric anything after his coronation. 
I was his prisoner then and not 
exactly kindly disposed toward 
him. It even occurred to me that my 
information might be worth some- 
thing one day — at least, my free- 
dom again — if that threat ever 
materialized. As for Brand, I doubt 
anyone would have believed me; 
and even if someone did, I was the 
only one who knew how to reach 
that shadow. Could you see Eric 
buying that as a reason for releas- 
ing me? He would have laughed 
and told me to come up with a 
better story. And I never heard 
from Brand again. None of the 
others seem to have heard from his 
either. Odds are he’s dead by 
now — I’d say. And that is the story 
I never got to tell you. You figure 
out what it all means. 

Ill 

I studied Random, remember- 
ing what a great card player he 
was. By looking at his face, I could 
no more tell whether he was lying, 
in whole or in part, than I could 
learn by scrutinizing the Jack of, 
say, Diamonds. Nice touch, that 
part, too. There was enough of that 
kind of business to his story to give 
it some feel of verisimilitude. 

“To paraphrase Oedipus, Ham- 
let, Lear and all those guys,” I said, 
“I wish I had known this some time 
ago.” 

"This was the first chance 1 
really had to tell you,” he said. 

“True,” I agreed. “Unfortunate- 
ly, it not only fails to clarify things, 
it complicates the puzzle even 
more. Which is no mean trick. 
Here we are with a black road

running up to the foot of Kolvir. It 
passes through Shadow, and things 
have succeeded in traversing it to 
beset Amber. We do not know the 
exact nature of the forces behind it, 
but they are obviously malign and 
they seem to be growing in 
strength. I have been feeling guilty 
about it for some while now, be- 
cause I see it as being tied in with 
my curse. Yes, I laid one on us. 
Curse or no curse though, every- 
thing eventually resolves into some 
sort of tangibility that can be com- 
bated. Which is exactly what we are 
going to do. But all week long, I 
have been trying to figure out 
Dara’s part in things. Who is she 
really? What is she? Why was she 
so anxious to try the Pattern? How 
is it that she managed to succeed? 
And that final threat of hers . 
‘Amber will be destroyed,’ she said. 
It seems more than coincidental 
that this occurred at the same time 
as the attack over the black road. I 
do not see it as a separate thing, 
but as a part of the same cloth. And 
it all seems to be tied in with the 
fact that there is a traitor some- 
where here in Amber — Caine’s 
death, the notes . Someone here 
is either abetting an external enemy 
or is behind the whole thing him- 
self. Now you link it all up with 
Brand’s disappearance, by way of 
this guy.” 1 nudged the corpse with 
my foot. “It makes it look as if 
Dad’s death or absence is also a 
part of it. If that is the case, 
though, it makes for a major con- 
spiracy — with detail after detail 
having been carefully worked out 
over a period of years.” 

Random explored a cupboard in 
the comer, produced a bottle and a 



pair of goblets. He filled them and 
brought me one, then returned to 
his chair. We drank a silent toast to 
futility. 

“Well,” he said, “plotting is the 
number one pastime around here, 
and everyone has had plenty of 
time, you know. We are both too 
young to remember brothers Osric 
and Finndo, who died for the good 
of Amber. But the impression I get 
from talking with Benedict — ” 

“Yes,” I said, “ — that they had 
done more than wishful thinking 
about the throne, and it became 
necessary that they die bravely for 
Amber. I’ve heard that, too. Maybe 
so, maybe not. We’ll never know 
for sure. Still . Yes, the point is 
well taken, though almost unneces- 
sary. I do not doubt that it has been 
tried before. I do not put it past a 
number of us. Who, though? We 
will be operating under a severe 
handicap until we find out. Any 
move that we make externally will 
probably only be directed against a 
limb of the beast. Come up with an 
idea.” 

“Corwin,” he said, “to be frank 
about it, I could make a case for it 
being anyone here — even myself, 
prisoner status and all. In fact, 
something like that would be a 
great blind for it. I would have 
taken genuine delight in looking 
helpless while actually pulling the 
strings that made all the others 
dance. Any of us would, though. 
We all have our motives, our am- 
bitions. And over the years, we all 
have had time and opportunity to 
lay a lot of groundwork. No, that is 
the wrong way to go about it, look- 
ing for suspects. Everyone here falls 
into that category. Let us decide in- 



42 



GALAXY 




stead what it is that would distin- 
guish such an individual, aside 
from motives, apart from oppor- 
tunities. I would say, let’s look at 
the methods involved.” 

“All right. Then you start.” 
“Some one of us knows more 
than the rest of us about the work- 
ings of Shadow — the ins and the 
outs, the whys and the hows. He 
also has allies, obtained from some- 
where fairly far afield. This is the 
combination he has brought to bear 
upon Amber. Now, we have no way 
of looking at a person and telling 
whether he possesses such special 
knowledge and skills. But let us 
consider where he could have ob- 
tained them. It could be that he 
simply learned something off in 
Shadow somewhere, on his own. Or 
he could have been studying all 
along, here, while Dworkin was still 
alive and willing to give lessons.” 

1 stared down into my glass. 
Dworkin could still be living. He 
had provided my means of escape 
from the dungeons of Amber — how 
long ago? 1 had told no one this, 
and was not about to. For one 
thing, Dworkin was quite mad — 
which was apparently why Dad had 
had him locked away. For another, 
he had demonstrated powers I did 
not understand, which convinced 
me he could be quite dangerous. 
Still, he had been kindly disposed 
toward me after a minimum of 
flattery and reminiscence. If he 
were still around, I suspected that 
with a bit of patience I might be 
able to handle him. So I had kept 
the w hole business locked away in 
my mind as a possible secret 
weapon. I saw no reason for chang- 
ing that decision at this point. 



“Brand did hang around him a 
lot,” I acknowledged, finally seeing 
what he was getting at. “He was 
interested in things of that sort." 

“Exactly," Random replied. 
“And he obviously knew more than 
the rest of us, to be able to send me 
that message without a Trump.” 

“You think he made a deal with 
outsiders, opened the way for them, 
then discovered that they no longer 
needed him when they hung him 
out to dry?” 

“Not necessarily. Though I sup- 
pose that is possible, too. My think- 
ing runs more like this — and I 
don’t deny my prejudice in his 
favor: I think he had learned 
enough about the subject so that he 
was able to detect it when someone 
did something peculiar involving 
the Trumps, the Pattern or that 
area of Shadow most adjacent to 
Amber. Then he slipped up. Per- 
haps he underestimated the culprit 
and confronted him directly, rather 
than going to Dad or Dworkin. 
What then? The guilty party sub- 
dued him and imprisoned him in 
that tower. Either he thought 
enough of him not to want to kill 
him if he did not have to, or he had 
some later use of him in mind.” 

“You make that sound plausible, 
too,” 'I said, and I would have 
added, “and it fits your story 
nicely” and watched his poker face 
again, except for one thing. Back 
when I was with Bleys, before our 
attack on Amber, I had had a mo- 
mentary contact with Brand while 
fooling with the Trumps. He had 
indicated distress, imprisonment, 
and then the contact had been 
broken. So Random’s story fit, to 
that extent. So, instead, I said, “If 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



43 




he can point the finger, we have got 
to get him back and set him to 
pointing.” 

“1 was hoping you would say 
that," Random replied. “I hate to 
leave a bit of business like that un- 
finished.” 



I went and fetched the bottle, re- 
filled our glasses. I sipped. I lit 
another cigarette. 

“Before we get into that,^ 
though,” I said. ”1 have to decide 
on the best way of breaking the 
news about Caine. Where is Flora 
anyway?” 

“Down in town, I think. She was 
here this morning. I can find her 
for you. I’m pretty sure.” 

“Do it, then. She is the only 
other one I know of who has seen 
one of these guys, back when they 
broke into her place in West- 
chester. We might as well have her 
handy for that much corroboration 
as to their nastiness. Besides, I 
have some other things I want to 
ask her.” 

He swallowed his drink and rose. 
“All right. I’ll go do that now. 
Where should I bring her?’.’ 

"My quarters. -If I’m not there, 
wait.” 

He nodded. 

I rose and accompanied him into 
the hall. 

“Have you got the key to this 
room?" I asked. 

“It's on a hook inside.” 

“Better get it and lock up. We 
wouldn’t want a premature unveil- 
ing.” 

He did that and gave me the key. 

1 walked with him as far as the first 
landing and saw him on his way. 



Then 1 headed for my own 
quarters. 

From my safe, I removed the 
Jew el of Judgment, a ruby pendant 
which had given Dad and Eric con- 
trol over the weather in the vicinity 
of Amber. Before he died, Eric had 
told me the procedure to be follow- 
ed in tuning it to my own use. I had 
not had time to do it though, and 
did not really have the time now. 
But during my conversation with 
Random 1 had decided that I was 
going to have to take the time. 1 
had located Dworkin’s notes, be- 
neath a stone near Eric’s fireplace. 
He had given me that much infor- 
mation also, that last time. I would 
have liked to know where he had 
come across the notes in the first 
place (hough, for they were incom- 
plete. I fetched them from the rear 
of the safe and regarded them once 
again. They did agree with Eric’s 
explanation as to how the attune- 
ment was to be managed. 

But they also indicated that the 
stone had other uses, that the con- 
trol of meteorological phenomena 
was almost an incidental, though 
spectacular demonstration of a 
complex of principles which under- 
lay the Pattern, the Trumps and 
the physical integrity of Amber her- 
self, apart from Shadow. Unfor- 
tunately, the details were lacking. 
Still, the more that 1 searched my 
memory, the more something along 
these lines did seem indicated. 
Only rarely had Dad produced the 
stone; and though he had spoken of 
it as a w'eather-changer, the 
weather had not always been es- 
pecially altered on those occasions 
when he had sported it. And he had 
often taken it along with him on his 



44 



GALAXY 




little trips. So 1 was ready to believe 
there was more to it than that. Eric 
had probably reasoned the same 
way, but he had not been able to 
dope out its other uses either. He 
had simply taken advantage of its 
obvious powers when Bleys and I 
had attacked Amber; and he had 
used it the same way this past week 
when the creatures had made their 
assault from the black road. It had 
served him well on both occasions, 
even if it had not been sufficient to 
save his life. So 1 had better get 
hold of its power myself, I decided, 
now. Any extra edge was impor- 
tant. And it would be good to be 
seen wearing the thing, too, 1 
judged. Especially now. 

I put the notes back into the safe, 
the jewel in my pocket. I left-then 
and headed downstairs. Again, as 
before, to walk those halls made me 
Icel as if I had never been away. 
This was home, this was what I 
wanted. Now 1 was its defender. I 
did not even wear the crown, yet all 
its problems had become my own. 
It was ironic. 1 had come back to 
claim the crown, to wrest it from 
Eric, to hold the glory, to reign. 
Now, suddenly, things were falling 
apart. It had not taken long to 
realize that Eric had behaved in- 
correctly. If he had indeed done 
Dad in, he had no right to the 
crown. If he had not, then he had 
acted prematurely. Either way, the 
coronation had served only to 
fatten his already obese ego. My- 
self, 1 wanted it and I knew that I 
could take it. But it would be 
equally irresponsible to do so with 
my troops quartered in Amber, sus- 
picion of Caine’s murder about to 
descend upon me, the first signs of 



a fantastic plot suddenly displayed 
before me and the continuing possi- 
bility that Dad was still alive. On 
several occasions, it seemed we had 
been in contact, briefly — and on 
one such, years ago, that he had 
okayed my succession. But there 
was so much deceit and trickery 
afoot that I did not know what to 
believe. He had not abdicated. 
Also, f had had a head injury, and I 
was well aware of my own desires. 
The mind is a funny place. I do not 
even trust my own. Could it be that 
I had manufactured that whole 
business? A lot had happened 
since. The price of being an 
Amberite, 1 suppose, is that you 
cannot even trust yourself. I 
wondered w'hat Freud would have 
said? While he had failed to pierce 
mv amnesia, he had come up with 
some awfully good guesses as to 
what my father had been like, what 
our relationship had been, even 
though I had not realized it at the 
time. I w ished that I could have one 
more session with him. 

I made my way through the 
marble dining hall and into the 
dark, narrow corridor that lay be- 
hind. I nodded to the guard and 
walked on back to the door. 
Through it then, out onto the plat- 
form, across and down. The inter- 
minable spiral stairway that leads 
into the guts of Kolvir. Walking. 
Lights every now and then. Black- 
ness beyond. 

I t seemed that a balance had 
shifted somewhere along the 
way. and that I was no longer act- 
ing but being acted upon, being 
forced to move, to respond. Being 
herded. And each move led to an-

other. Where had it all begun? 
Maybe it had been going on for 
years and 1 was only just now be- 
coming aware of it. Perhaps we 
were all victims, in a fashion and to 
a degree none of us had realized. 
Great victuals for morbid thought. 
Sigmund, where are you now? I 
had wanted to be king — still 
wanted to be king — more than any- 
thing else. Yet the more 1 learned 
and the more I thought about what 
1 had learned, the more all of my 
movements actually seemed to 
amount to Amber Pawn to King 
Four. I realized then that this feel- 
ing had been present for some time, 
growing, and 1 did not like it at all. 
But nothing that has eyer lived has 
gotten by without making some 
mistake, 1 consoled myself. If my 
feeling represented actuality, my 
personal Pavlov was getting closer 
to my fangs with each ringing of the 
bell. Soon now, soon, I felt that it 
had to be soon, I would have to see 
that he came very near. Then it 
would be mine to see that he 
neither went away nor ever came 
again. 

Turning, turning, around and 
down, light here, light there, these 
my thoughts, like thread on a 
spool, winding or unwinding, hard 
to be sure. Below me the sound of 
metal against stone. A guard’s 
scabbard, the guard rising. A 
ripple of light from a lantern 
raised. 

“Lord Corwin . .” 

“Jamie.” 

At bottom, 1 took a lantern from 
the shelf. Putting a light to it, I 
turned and headed toward the 
tunnel, pushing the darkness on 
ahead of me, a step at a time. 



Eventually the tunnel, and so up 
it, counting side passages. It was 
the seventh that I wanted. Echoes 
and shadows. Must and dust. 

Coming to it, then. Turning 
there. Not too much farther. 

Finally, that great, dark metal- 
bound door. 1 unlocked it and 
pushed hard. It creaked, resisted, 
finally moved inward. 

I set the lantern down, just to the 
right, inside. I had no further need 
of it. as the Pattern itself gave off 
sufficient light for what I had to do. 

For a moment, I regarded the 
Pattern — a shining mass of curved 
lines that tricked the eye as it tried 
to trace them — imbedded there, 
huge, in the floor's slick blackness. 
It had given me power over 
Shadow, it had restored most of my 
memory. It would also destroy me 
in an instant if 1 were to essay it im- 
properly. What gratitude the pros- 
pect did arouse in me was therefore 
not untinged with fear. It was a 
splendid and cryptic old family 
heirloom which belonged right 
where it was, in the cellar. 

1 moved off to the corner where 
the tracery began. There I com- 
posed my mind,' relaxed my body 
and set my left foot upon the 
Pattern. Without pausing, I strode 
forward then and felt the current 
begin. Blue sparks outlined my 
boots. Another step. There was an 
audible crackling this time and the 
beginning of resistance. I took the 
first curvelength, striving to hurry, 
wanting to reach the First Veil as 
quickly as possible. By the time 
that 1 did, my hair was stirring and 
the sparks were brighter, longer. 

The strain increased. Each step 
required more effort than the pre- 



46 



GALAXY 




vious one. The crackling grew 
louder and the current intensified. 
My hair rose and I shook off 
sparks. 1 kept my eyes on the fiery 
line and did not stop pushing. 

Suddenly the pressure abated. I 
staggered but kept moving. I was 
through the First Veil and into the 
feeling of accomplishment that en- 
tailed. 1 recalled the last time that I 
had come this way, in Rebma, the 
city under the sea. The maneuver I 
had just completed was what had 
started the return of my memories. 
Yes. I pushed ahead and the sparks 
grew and the currents rose once 
again, setting my flesh to tingling. 

T he second veil . The 
angles ... It always seemed to 
tax the strength to its limits, to pro- 
duce the feeling that one’s entire 
being was transformed into pure 
Will. It was a driving, relentless 
sensation. At the moment, the 
negotiation of the Pattern was the 
only thing in the world that meant 
anything to me. 1 had always been 
there, striving, never been away, al- 
ways would be there, contending, 
my will against the maze of power. 
Time had vanished. Only the ten- 
sion held. 

The sparks were up to my waist. 

1 entered the Grand Curve and 
fought my way along it. I was con- 
tinually destroyed and reborn at 
every step of its length, baked by 
the fires of creation, chilled by the 
cold at entropy’s end. 

Out and onward, turning. Three 
more curves, a straight line, a 
number of arcs. Dizziness, a sensa- 
tion of fading and intensifying as 
though 1 were oscillating into and 
out of existence. Turn after turn 



after turn after turn ... A short, 
sharp arc . The line that led to 
the Final Veil ... I imagine I was 
gasping and drenched with sweat 
by then. I never seem to remember 
for sure. I could hardly move my 
feet. The sparks were up to my 
shoulders. They came into my eyes 
and I lost sight of the Pattern itself 
between blinks. In, out, in, 
out . There it was. I dragged my 
right foot forward, knowing how 
Benedict must have felt, his legs 
snared by the black grass. Right 
before I rabbit-punched him. I felt 
bludgeoned myself — all over. Left 
foot, forward ... So slowly it was 
hard to be certain it was actually 
moving. My hands were blue 
(lames, my legs pillars of fire. An- 
other step. Another. Yet another. 

1 felt like a slowly animated 
statue, a thawing snowman, a 
buckling girder . Two more . 
Three . Glacial, my movements, 
but I who directed them had all of 
eternity and a perfect constancy of 
will that would be realized . 

I passed through the Veil. A 
short arc followed. Three steps to 
cross it into blackness and peace. 
They were the worst of all. 

A coffee break for Sisyphus! 
That was my first thought as I de- 
parted the Pattern. I've done it 
again ! was my second. And, Never 
again! was my third. 

I allowed myself the luxury of a 
few deep breaths and a little shak- 
ing. Then I unpocketed the jewel 
and raised it by its chain. I held it 
before my eye. 

Red inside, of course — a deep 
cherry-red, smoke-shot, fulgent. It 
seemed to have picked up some- 
thing extra of light and glitter

during the trip through the Pattern. 
I continued to stare, thinking over 
the instructions, comparing them 
with things I already knew. 

Once you have walked the 
Pattern and reached this point, you 
can cause it to transport you to any 
place that you can visualize. All 
that it takes is the desire and an act 
of will. Such being the case, 1 was 
not without a moment’s trepida- 
tion. If the effect proceeded as it 
normally did, I could be throwing 
myself into a peculiar sort of trap. 
But Eric had succeeded. He had 
not been locked into the heart of a 
gem somewhere off in Shadow. The 
Dworkin who had written those 
notes had been a great man, and I 
had trusted him. 

Composing my mind, I intensi- 
fied my scrutiny of the stone's 
interior. 

There was a distorted reflection 
of the Pattern within it, surrounded 
by winking points of light, tiny 
flares and flashes, different curves 
and paths. I made my decision, I 
focused my will . 

R edness and slow motion. Like 
sinking into an ocean of high 
viscosity. Very slowly, at first. 
Drifting and darkening, all the 
pretty lights far, far ahead. Faintly, 
my apparent velocity increased. 
Flakes of light, distant, inter- 
mittent. A trifle faster then, it 
seemed. No scale. 1 was a point of 
consciousness of indeterminate di- 
mensions. Aware of movement, 
aware of the configuration toward 
which 1 advanced, now almost 
rapidly. The redness was nearly 
gone, as w<as the consciousness of 
any medium. Resistance vanished. 



I was speeding. All of this, now, 
-seemed to have taken but a single 
instant, w'as still taking that same 
instant. There was a peculiar time- 
less quality to the entire affair. My 
velocity relative to what now seem- 
ed my target was enormous. The 
little, twisted maze was growing, 
was resolving into what appeared a 
three-dimensional variation of the 
Pattern itself. Punctuated by flares 
of colored light, it grew before me, 
still reminiscent of a bizarre galaxy 
half-ravelled in the middle of the 
ever-night, haloed with a pale shine 
of dust, its streamers composed of 
countless flickering points. And it 
grew or 1 shrank, or it advanced or 
I advanced, and we were near, near 
together, and it filled all of space 
now, top to bottom, this way to 
that, and my personal velocity still 
seemed, if anything, to be increas- 
ing. 1 was caught, overwhelmed by 
the blaze, and there was a stray 
streamer w hich 1 knew to be the be- 
ginning. 1 was too close — lost, 
actually — to apprehend its overall 
configuration any longer, but the 
buckling, the flickering, the weav- 
ing of all that I could see of it, 
everywhere about me, made me 
wonder whether three dimensions 
were sufficient to account for the 
senses warping complexities with 
which 1 w'as confronted. Rather 
than my galactic analogy, some- 
thing in my mind shifted to the 
other extreme, suggesting the in- 
finitely dimensioned Hilbert space 
of the subatomic. But then, it was a 
metaphor of desperation. Truly 
and simply, 1 did not understand 
anything about it. 1 had only a 
growing feeling — Pattern-condi- 

tioned? Instinctive? — that 1 had to 



48 



GALAXY 




pass through this maze also to gain 
the new degree of power that I 
sought. 

Nor was I incorrect. 1 was swept 
on into it without any slackening of 
my apparent velocity. I was spun' 
and whirled along blazing ways, 
passing through substanceless 
clouds of glitter and shine. There 
were no areas of resistance, as in 
the Pattern itself, my initial im- 
petus seeming sufficient to bear me 
throughout. A whirlwind tour of 
the Milky Way? A drowning man 
sw ept among canyons of coral? An 
insomniac sparrow' passing over an 
amusement park of a July Fourth 
evening? These my thoughts, as I 
recapitulated my recent passage in 
this transformed fashion. 

. And out, through, over and 
done, in a blaze of ruddy light that 
found me regarding myself holding 
the pendant beside the Pattern, 
then regarding the pendant, 
Pattern within it, within me, every- 
thing within me, me within it, the 
redness subsiding, down, gone. 
Then just me, the pendant, the 
Pattern, alone, subject-object rela- 
tionships reestablished — only an 
octave higher, which is about the 
best way I feel there is to put it. For 
a certain empathy now existed. It 
was as though I had acquired an 
extra sense, and an additional 
means of expression. It was a 
peculiar sensation, satisfying. 

Anxious to test it, I summoned 
my resolve once again and com- 
manded the Pattern to transport 
me elsew'here. 

I stood then in the round room, 
atop the highest tower in Amber. 
Crossing it, 1 passed outside, onto a 
very small balcony. The contrast 



,was powerful, coming so close to 
the super-sensory voyage 1 had just 
completed. For several long 
moments, I simply stood there, 
looking. 

The sea was a study in textures, 
as the sky was partly overcast and 
getting on toward evening. The 
clouds themselves showed patterns 
of soft brightness and rough shad- 
ing. The w'ind made its way sea- 
ward, so that the salt smell was 
temporarily denied me. Dark birds 
dotted the air, swinging and hover- 
ing at a great distance out over the 
water. Below me, the palace yards 
and the terraces of the city lay 
spread in enduring elegance out to 
Kolvic's rim. People were tiny on 
the thoroughfares, their move- 
ments discountable. 1 felt very 
alone. 

Then I touched the pendant and 
called for a storm. 

IV 

t\andom and Flora were waiting 
JKin my quarters when I returned. 
Random’s eyes went first to the 
pendant, then to my own. I 
nodded. 

I turned toward Flora, bowing 
slightly. 

“Sister,” 1 said, “it has been 
awhile, and then awhile.” 

She looked somewhat frightened, 
which was all to the good. She 
smiled and took my hand, though. 

“Brother,” she said. “I see that 
you have kept your word.” 

Pale gold, her hair. She had cut 
it, but retained the bangs. I could 
not decide w'hether I liked it that 
way or not. She had very lovely 
hair. Blue eyes, too, and tons of 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



49 




vanity to keep everything in her 
favorite perspective. At times she 
seemed to behave quite stupidly, 
but then at other times 1 have 
wondered. 

"Excuse me for staring,” I said, 
"but the last time that we met 1 was 
unable to see you.” 

“I am very happy that the situa- 
tion has been corrected,” she said. 
“It was quite — There was nothing 
that 1 could do, you know.” 

“I know,” I said, recalling the 
occasional lilt of her laughter from 
the other side of the darkness on 
one of the anniversaries of the 
event. “1 know.” 

I moved to the window and 
opened it, knowing that the rain 
would not be coming in. I like the 
smell of a storm. 

“Random, did you learn any- 
thing of interest with regard to a 
possible postman?” I asked. 

“Not really,” he said. “I made 
some inquiries. No one seems to 
have seen anyone else in the right 
place at the right time.” 

“I see,” I said. “Thank you. 1 
may see you again later.” 

"All right,” he said. “I’ll be in 
my quarters all evening, then.” 

I nodded, turned, leaned back 
against the sill, watched Flora. 
Random closed the door quietly as 
he left. I listened to the rain for half 
a minute or so. 

“What are you going to do with 
me?” she said, finally. 

"Do?” 

“You are in a position to call for 
a settlement on old debts. I assume 
that things are about to begin.” 
“Perhaps,” I said. “Most things 
depend on other things. This thing 
is no different." 



“What do you mean?” 

“Give me what 1 want, and we’ll 
see. I have even been known to be a 
nice guy on occasion.” 

“What is it that you want?” 
“The story. Flora. Let’s start 
with that. Of how you came to be 
my shepherdess there on that 
shadow, Earth. All pertinent 
details. What was the arrange- 
ment? What was the understand- 
ing? Everything. That’s all.” 

She sighed. 

“The beginning . ." she said. 
“Yes ... It was in Paris, a party, 
at a certain Monsieur Focault’s. 
This was about three years before 
the Terror—” 

“Stop,” I said. “What were you 
doing there?” 

“I had been in that general area 
of Shadow for approximately five of 
their years,” she said. “I had been 
wandering, looking for something 
novel, something that suited my 
fancy. I came upon that place at 
that time in the same way we find 
anything. 1 let my desires lead me 
and 1 followed my instincts.” 

“A peculiar coincidence.” 

“Not in light of all the time in- 
volved — and considering the 
amount of travel in which we in- 
dulge. It was, if you like, my 
Avalon, my Amber surrogate, my 
home away from home. Call it what 
you will, 1 was there, at that party, 
that October night, when you came 
in with the little redheaded girl — 
Jacqueline. 1 believe, was her 
name.” 

That brought it back, from 
quite a distance, a memory 1 hadn’t 
called for in a long, long while. 1 
remembered Jacqueline far better 
than I did Focault’s party, but 



50

(here- had been such an occasion. 
“Go ahead.” 



66 A s * sa 'd' s * ie went on, “I was 
there. You arrived later. 
You caught my attention immedi- 
ately, of course. Still, if one exists 
for a sufficiently long period of time 
and travels considerably, one does 
occasionally encounter a person 
greatly resembling someone else 
one has known. That was my first 
thought after the initial excitement 
faded. Surely, it had to be a 
double. So much time had passed 
without a whisper. Yet, we all have 
secrets and good reasons for having 
them. This could be one of yours. 
So I saw that we were introduced 
and then had a devil of a time 
getting you away from that little 
redheaded piece for more than a 
few minutes. And you insisted your 
name was Fenneval— Cordell Fen- 
neval. I grew uncertain. I could not 
tell w hether it was a double or you 
playing games. The third possi- 
bility did cross my mind, though — 
that you had dwelled in some adja- 
cent area of Shadow for a sufficient 
time to cast shadows of yourself. 1 
might have departed still wonder- 
ing had not Jacqueline later 
boasted to me concerning your 
strength. Now this is not the com- 
monest subject of conversation for 
a woman, and the way in Nvhich she 
said it led me to believe that she 
had actually been quite impressed 
by some things you had done. 1 
drew her out a bit and realized that 
they w ere all of them feats of which 
you were capable. That eliminated 
the notion of it being a double. It 
had to be either you or your 



shadow. This in mind, even if 
Cordell was not Corwin he w'as a 
clue, a clue that you were or had 
been in that shady neighborhood — 
the first real clue I had come across 
concerning your whereabouts. 1 
had to pursue it. I began keeping 
track of you then, checking into 
your past. The more people I ques- 
tioned, the more puzzling it be- 
came. In fact, after several months 
I was still unable to decide. There 
were enough smudgy areas to make 
it possible. Things were resolved for 
me the follow'ing summer though, 
when 1 revisited Amber for a time. I 
mentioned the peculiar affair to 
Eric . .” 

“Yes?” 

“Well . .He was — somewhat — 
aware — of the possibility.” 

She paused and rearranged her 
gloves on the seat beside her. 

"Uh-huh,” I said. “Just what did 
he tell you?” 

“That it might be the real you,” 
she said. “He told me there had 
been — an accident — ” 

“Really?" 

“Well, no," she admitted. “Not 
an accident. He said there had been 
a fight and he had injured you. He 
thought you were going to die, and 
he did not want the blame. So he 
transported you off into Shadow 
and left you there, in that place. 
After a long while, he decided that 
you must be dead, that it was 
finally all over between you. My 
news naturally disturbed him. So 
he swore me to secrecy and sent me 
back to keep you under surveil- 
lance. I had a good excuse for being 
there, as 1 had already told every- 
one how much I liked the place.” 
“You didn’t promise to keep

silent for nothing. Flora. What did 
he give you?” 

“He gave me his word that 
should he ever come into power 
here in Amber, I would not be for- 
gotten." 

"A little risky,” I said. “After 
all, that would still leave you with 
something on him — knowledge of 
the whereabouts of a rival 
claimant, and of his part in putting 
him there.” 

“True. But things sort of 
balanced out, and 1 would have to 
admit having become an accom- 
plice in order to talk about it.” 

I nodded. 

“Tight, but not impossible,” I 
agreed. “But did you think he 
would let me continue living if he 
ever did get a chance at the 
throne?” 

“That was never discussed. 
Never.” 

“It must have crossed your mind, 
though.” 

“Yes, later,” she said, “and I de- 
cided that he would probably do 
nothing. After all, it was beginning 
to seem likely that you had been de- 
prived of your memory. There was 
no reason to do anything to you so 
long as you were harmless.” 

"So you stayed on to watch me, 
to see that 1 remained harmless?” 

“Yes." 

"What would you have done had 
I shown signs of recovering my 
memory?” 

She looked at me, then looked 
away. 

“I would have reported it to 
Eric.” 

“And what would he have done 
then?” 

“1 don’t know.” 



I laughed a little, and she blush- 
ed. I could not remember the last 
time that 1 had seen Flora blush. 

“1 will not belabor the obvious,” 
I said. “All right, you stayed on, 
you watched me. What next? What 
happened?” 

“Nothing special. You just went 
on leading your life and 1 went on 
keeping track of it.” 

“All of the others knew where 
you were?” 

“Yes, I’d made no secret of my 
whereabouts. In fact, all of them 
came around to visit me at one time 
or another.” 

“That includes Random?” 

She curled her lip. 

“Yes. several times,” she said. 
"Why the sneer?” 

“It is too late to start pretending 
1 like him,” she said. “You know. I 
just don’t like the people he asso- 
ciates with — assorted criminals, 
jazz musicians ... I had to show 
him family courtesy when he was 
visiting my shadow, but- he put a 
big strain on my nerves, bringing 
those people around at all hours — 
jam sessions, poker parties. The 
place usually reeked for weeks 
afterward and I was always glad to 
see him go. Sorry. I know you like 
him, but you wanted the truth.” 
“He offended your delicate sensi- 
bilities. Okay. I now direct your at- 
tention to the brief time when I was 
your guest. Random joined us 
rather abruptly. Pursuing him were 
half a dozen nasty fellows whom we 
dispatched in your living room.” 

“I recall the event quite vividly.” 
“Do you recall the guys respon- 
sible — the creatures we had to deal 
with?" 

“Yes.”

“Sufficiently well to recognize 
one if you ever saw another?” 

"1 think so.” 

"Good. Had you ever seen one 
before?” 

"No." 

“Since?” 

“No." 

“Had you ever heard them de- 
scribed, anywhere?” 

“Not that 1 can remember. 
Why?” 

1 shook my head. 

"Not yet. This is my inquisition, 
remember? Now 1 want you to 
think back for a time before that 
evening. Back to the event that put 
me in Greenwood. Maybe even a 
little earlier. What happened, and 
how did you find out about it? 
What were the circumstances? 
What was your part in things?” 
“Yes,” she said, “I knew you 
would ask me that sooner or later. 
What happened was that Eric con- 
tacted me the day after it oc- 
curred — from Amber, via my 
Trump.” She glanced at me again, 
obviously to see how I was taking it, 
to study my reactions. I remained 
expressionless. “He told me you 
had been in a bad accident the pre- 
vious evening, and that you were 
hospitalized. He told me to have 
you transferred to a private place, 
one where 1 could have more say as 
to the course of your treatment.” 
“In other words, he wanted me 
to stay a vegetable.” 

“He wanted them to keep you se- 
dated.” 

“Did he or did he not admit to 
being responsible for the acci- 
dent?” 

“He did not say that he had had 
someone shoot out your tire, but he 



did know that that was what had 
happened. How else could he have 
known? When I learned later that 
he was planning to take the throne. 
I assumed that he had finally de- 
cided it was best to remove you en- 
tirely. When the attempt failed, it 
seemed logical that he would do the 
next most effective thing: see that 
you were kept out of the way until 
after the coronation.” 

“I was not aware that the tire 
had been shot out,” I said. 

Her face changed. She recover- 
ed. 

“You told me that you knew it 
was not an accident — that someone 
had tried to kill you. I assumed you 
were aware of the specifics.” 

I was treading slightly mucky 
ground again for the first time 
in a long while. I still had a bit of 
amnesia, and 1 had decided I prob- 
ably always would. My memories 
were still spotty for a few days prior 
to the accident. The Pattern had re- 
stored the lost memories of my en- 
tire life up until then, but the 
trauma appeared to have destroyed 
recollection of some of the events 
immediately preceeding it. Not an 
uncommon occurrence. Organic 
damage rather than simple func- 
tional distress, most likely. 1 was 
happy enough to have all the rest 
back, so those did not seem es- 
pecially lamentable. As to the acci- 
dent itself, and my feelings that it 
had been more than an accident, I 
did recall the gunshots. There had 
been two of them. 1 might even 
have glimpsed the figure with the 
rifle — tleetingly, too late. Or maybe 
that was pure fantasy. It seemed 
that l had, though. 1 had had some-

thing like that in mind when I had 
headed out for Westchester. Even 
at this late time, though, when I 
held the power in Amber, 1 was 
loathe to admit this single defi- 
ciency. 1 had faked my way with 
Flora before with a lot less to go on. 
I decided to stick with a winning 
combination. 

“I was in no position to get out 
and see what had been hit,” 1 said. 
"I heard the shots. 1 lost control. I 
had assumed that it was a tire, but 
1 never knew for sure. The only rea- 
son I raised the question was be- 
cause I was curious as to how you 
knew it was a tire.” 

“I already told you that Eric told 
me aboqt it." 

“It was the way that you said it 
that bothered me. You made it 
sound as if you already knew all the 
details before he contacted you.” 

She shook her head. 

“Then pardon my syntax,” she 
said. “That sometimes happens 
when you look at things after the 
fact. 1 am going to have to deny 
what you are implying. I had 
nothing to do with it and I had no 
prior knowledge that it had 
occurred.” 

“Since Eric is no longer around 
to confirm or deny anything, we 
will simply have to let it go,” I said, 
“for now," and I said it to make 
her look even harder to her defense, 
to direct her attention away from 
any possible slip, either in word or 
expression, from which she might 
infer the small flaw which still 
existed in my memory. “Did you 
later become aware of the identity 
of the person with the gun?” I 
asked. 

“Never," she said. “Most likely 



some hired thug. 1 don’t know.” 
“Have you any idea how long I 
was unconscious before someone 
found me, took me to a hospital?” 
She shook her head again. 
Something was bothering me and 
I could not quite put my finger on 
it. 

“Did Eric say what time 1 had 
been taken into the hospital?” 
“No.” 

“When I was with you, why did 
you try walking back to Amber, 
rather than using Eric’s Trump?” 
“1 couldn’t raise him.” 

"You could have called someone 
else to bring you through,” I said. 
“Flora, I think you are lying to 
me.” 

It was really only a test, to ob- 
serve her reaction. Why not? 

“About w'hat?” she asked. “I 
couldn’t raise anyone else. They 
were all otherwise occupied. Is that 
what you mean?” 

She studied me. 

1 raised my arm and pointed at 
her and the lightning flashed at my 
back, just outside the window. I felt 
a tingle, a mild jolt. The thunder- 
clap was also impressive. 

“You sin by omission,” I tried. 
She covered her face with her 
hands and began to weep. 

“I don’t know what you mean!” 
she said. “I answered all your ques- 
tions! What do you want? 1 don’t 
know where you were going or who 
shot at you or what time it oc- 
curred! I just know the facts I’ve 
given you, damn it!” 

She was either sincere or un- 
breakable by these means, I de- 
cided. Whichever, I was wasting 
my time and could get nothing 
more this way. Also, I had better

switch us away from the accident 
before she began thinking too 
much about its importance to me. 
If there was something there that I 
was missing, I wanted to find it 
first. 

“Come with me,” I said. 

“Where are we going?” 

“I have something I want you to 
identify. I will tell you why after you 
see it.” 

She rose and followed me. 1 took 
her up the hall to see the body be- 
fore I gave her the story on Caine. 
She regarded the corpse quite dis- 
passionately. She nodded. 

“Yes,” she said, and, “Even if I 
did not know it I would be glad to 
say that 1 did, for you.” 

I grunted a noncommital. Family 
loyalty always touches me, some- 
where. I could not tell whether she 
believed what 1 had said about 
Caine. But things sort of being 
equal to each other, it didn’t much 
seem to matter. I did not tell her 
anything about Brand and she did 
not seem to possess any new infor- 
mation concerning him. Her only 
other comment when everything I’d 
had to say was said, was, “You 
wear the Jewel well. What about 
the headpiece?” 

“It is too soon to talk of such 
things,” I told her. 

“Whatever my support may be 
worth . .” 

“1 know,” I said. “I know.” 

M y tomb is a quiet place. It 
stands alone in a rocky de- 
_ , shielded on three sides 
against the elements, surrounded 
by transported soil wherein a pair 
of scrubby trees, miscellaneous 
shrubs, weeds and great ropes of 



mountain ivy are rooted, about two 
miles down, back of the crest of 
Kolvir. It is a long, low building 
with two benches in front, and the 
ivy has contrived to cover it to a 
great extent, mercifully masking 
most of a bombastic statement 
graven on its face beneath my 
name. It is, understandably, vacant 
most of the time. 

That evening, however, Ganelon 
and I repaired thither, accom- 
panied by a good supply of wine 
and some loaves and cold cuts. 

“You weren’t joking!” he said, 
having dismounted, crossed over 
and parted the ivy, able to read by 
the moon’s light the words that 
were rendered there. 

“Of course not,” I said, climbing 
down and taking charge of the 
horses. “It's mine all right.” 

Tethering our mounts to a 
nearby shrub. 1 unslung our bags of 
provisions and carried them to the 
nearest bench. Ganelon joined me 
as 1 opened the first bottle and 
poured us a dark, deep pair. 

“I still don’t understand,” he 
said, accepting his. 

“What’s there to understand? 
I’m dead and buried there,” I said. 
“It’s my cenotaph, is what it

is — the monument that gets set up 
when the body has not been re- 
covered. 1 only just learned about 
mine recently. It was raised several 
centuries ago, when it was decided 
I wasn’t coming back.” 

“Kind of spooky,” he said. 
“What’s inside then?” 

“Nothing. Though they did 
thoughtfully provide a niche and a 
casket, just in case my remains put 
in an appearance. You cover both 
bets that way.” 

Ganelon made himself a sand- 
wich. 

“Whose idea was it?” he asked. 
“Random thinks it was Brand’s 
or Eric’s. No one remembers for 
sure. They all seemed to feel it was 
a good idea at the time.” 

He chuckled, an evil noise that 
perfectly suited his creased, scarred 
and red-bearded self. 

“What’s to become of it now?” 

1 shrugged. 

“1 suppose some of them think 
it’s a shame to w r aste it this way and 
would like to see me fill it. In the 
meantime though, it’s a good place 
to come and get drunk. 1 hadn’t 
really paid my respects yet.” 

I put together a pair of sand- 
wiches and ate them both. This was 
the first real breather I had had 
since my return, and perhaps the 
last for some time to come. It was 
impossible to say. But 1 had not 
really had a chance to speak with 
Ganelon at any length during the 
past week, and he was one of the 
few persons 1 trusted. 1 wanted to 
tell him everything. I had to. I had 
to talk with someone who was not a 
part of it in the same way as the rest 
of us. So I did. 

The moon moved a considerable 



distance and the shards of broken 
glass multiplied within my crypt. 

“So how did the others take it?” 
he asked me. 

“Predictably,” 1 answered. “I 
could tell that Julian did not believe 
a word of it even though he said 
that he did. He knows how I feel 
about him, and he is in no position 
to challenge me. I don’t think 
Benedict believes me either, but he 
is a lot harder to read. He is biding 
his time, and 1 hope giving me the 
benefit of the doubt while he is 
about it. As for Gerard, 1 have the 
feeling that this was the final 
weight, and whatever trust he had 
left for me has just collapsed. Still, 
he will be returning to Amber early 
tomorrow', to accompany me to the 
Grove to recover Caine’s body. No 
sense in turning it into a safari, but 
1 did want another family member 
present. Deirdre now — She seemed 
happy about it. Didn’t believe a 
word. I’m sure. But no matter. She 
has always been on my side, and 
she has never liked Caine. I’d say 
she is glad that I seem to be consoli- 
dating my position. I can’t really 
tell whether Llewlla believed me or 
not. She doesn’t much give a damn 
what the rest of us do to one an- 
other, so far as 1 can see. As to 
Fiona, she simply seemed amused 
at the w hole business. But then, she 
has always had this detached, 
superior way of regarding things. 
You can never be certain what rep- 
resents her real thinking.” 

“Did you tell them the business 
about Brand yet?” 

“No. I told them about Caine 
and 1 told them 1 wanted them all 
to be in Amber by tomorrow eve- 
ning. That is when the subject of 



56 



GALAXY 




Brand will be raised. I’ve an idea 1 
want to try out.” 

“You contacted all of them by 
means of the Trumps?” 

"That’s right.” 

“There is something 1 have been 
meaning to ask you about that. 
Back on the shadow world we 
visited to obtain the weapons, there 
are telephones . .” 

“Yes?" 

“1 learned about wiretaps and 
such while we were there. Is it 
possible, do you think, that the 
frumps could be bugged?” 

I began to laugh, then caught 
myself as some of the implications 
of his suggestion sank in. Finally, 
“I don’t really know,” I said. “So 
much concerning Dworkin’s work 
remains a mystery — The thought 
just never occurred to me. I’ve 
never tried it myself. 1 wonder, 
though . .?” 

"Do you know how many sets 
there are?” 

“Well, everyone in the family has 
a pack and there were a dozen or so 
spares in the library. I don’t really 
know whether there are any 
others.” 

“It seems to me that a lot could 
be learned just by listening in.” 

“Yes. Dad’s deck. Brand’s, my 
original pack, the one Random 
lost — Hell! There are quite a 
number unaccounted for these 
days. 1 don’t know what to do 
about it yet. Start an inventory and 
try some experiments, 1 guess. 
Thanks for mentioning it.” 

He nodded and we both sipped 
for awhile in silence. 

Then, “What are you going to 
do. Corwin?” he asked. 

"About what?” 



“About everything. What do we 
attack now, and in what order?” 

rY original intention was 

JYJto begin tracing the black 
road toward its origin as soon as 
things were more settled here in 
Amber,” I said. “Now though, I 
have shifted my priorities. I want 
Brand returned as soon as possible, 
if he is still living. If not, 1 want to 
find out what happened to him.” 

"But will the enemy give you the 
breathing time? He might be pre- 
paring a new offensive right now.” 

“Yes, of course. 1 have consider- 
ed that. I feel we have some time, 
since they were defeated so re- 
cently. They will have to pull them- 
selves together again, beef up their 
forces, reassess the situation in 
light of our new weapons. What 1 
have in mind for the moment is to 
establish a series of lookout stations 
along the road to give us advance 
warning of any new movements on 
their part. Benedict has already 
agreed to take charge of the opera- 
tion." 

"I wonder how much time we 
have?” 

I poured him another drink, as it 
was the only answer I could think 
of. 

“Things were never this compli- 
cated back in Avalon — our Avalon, 
I mean.” 

“True,” I said. “You are not the 
only one who misses those days. At 
least, they seem simpler now.” 

He nodded. 1 offered him a ciga- 
rette, but he declined in favor of his 
pipe. In the llamelight, he studied 
the Jewel of Judgment which still 
hung about my neck. 

“You say you can really control

the weather with that thing?” he 
asked. 

“Yes,” I said. 

“How do you know?” 

“I’ve tried it. It works.” 

“What did you do?” 

“That storm this afternoon. It 
was mine.” 

"I wonder . .?” 

“What?” 

“I wonder what I would have 
done with that sort of power? What 
I'd do with it?" 

“The first thing that crossed my 
mind," I said, slapping the wall of 
my tomb, “was to destroy this place 
by lightning — strike it repeatedly 
and reduce it to rubble. Leave no 
doubt in anyone’s mind as to my 
feelings, my power.” 

“Why didn’t you?” 

“Got to thinking about it a bit 
more then. Decided — Hell! They 
might really have a use for the place 
before too long, if I’m not smart 
enough or tough enough or lucky 
enough. Such being the case, I 
tried to decide where I would like 
them to dump my bones. It caught 
me then that this is really a pretty 
good spot — up high, clean, where 
the elements still walk naked. 
Nothing in sight but rock and sky. 
Stars, clouds, sun, moon, wind, 
rain — Better company than a lot of 
other stiffs. Don’t know why I 
should have to lie beside anyone I 
wouldn’t want next to me now, and 
there aren’t many.” 

“You're getting morbid, Corwin. 
Or drunk. Or both. Bitter, too. 
You don’t need that.” 

“Who the hell are you to say 
what 1 need?” 

I felt him stiffen beside me, then 
relax. 



"I don’t know,” he finally said. 
"Just saying what I see.” 

"How are the troops holding 
up?” 1 asked. 

“I think they are still bewildered, 
Corwin. They came to fight a holy 
war on the slopes of heaven. They 
think that’s what the shooting was 
all about last week. So they are 
happy on that count, seeing as we 
won. But now this waiting, in the 
city — They don’t understand the 
place. Some of the ones they, 
thought to be enemies are now 
friends. They are confused. They 
know they are being kept ready for 
combat, but they have no idea 
against whom, or when. As they 
have been restricted to the billets 
the whole time, they have not yet 
realized the extent to which their 
presence is resented by the regulars 
and the population at large. They 
w ill probably be catching on fairly 
soon, though. 1 had been waiting to 
raise the subject, but you’ve been so 
busy lately . .” 

I sat smoking for a time. 

Then, "I guess I had better have 
a talk with them,” 1 said. “Won’t 
have a chance tomorrow, though, 
and something should be done 
soon. I think they should be 
moved — to a bivouack area in the 
Forest of Arden. Tomorrow, yes. 
I'll locate it for you on the map 
when we get back. Tell them it is to 
keep them close to the black road. 
Tell them that another attack could 
come that way at any time — 
which is no less than the truth. 
Drill them, maintain their fighting 
edge. I’ll come down as soon as I 
can and talk to them.” 

“That w’ill leave you without a 
personal force in Amber.”

"True. It may prove a useful risk 
though, both as a demonstration of 
confidence and a gesture of consid- 
eration. Yes, I think it will turn out 
to be a good move. If not ...” I 
shrugged. 

I poured and tossed another 
empty into my tomb. 

“By the way,” I said, “I’m 
sorry.” 

"What for?” 

“1 just noticed that I am morbid 
and drunk and bitter. I don’t need 
that." 

He chuckled and clicked his 
glass against my own. 

"I know,” he said. “1 know.” 

So we sat there while the moon 
fell, till the last bottle was interred 
among its fellows. We talked for a 
time of days gone by. At length, we 
fell silent, and my eyes drifted to 
the stars above Amber. It was good 
that we had come to this place, but 
now the city was calling me back. 
Knowing my thoughts, Ganelon 
rose and stretched, headed for the 
horses. I relieved myself beside my 
tomb and followed him. 

V 

T he Grove of the Unicorn lies in 
Arden to the southwest of 
Kolvir. near to that jutting place 
where the land begins its final 
descent into the valley called Gar- 
natli. While Garnath had been 
cursed, burned, invaded and 
fought through in recent years, the 
adjacent highlands stood unmo- 
lested. The grove where Dad 
claimed to have seen the unicorn 
ages before and to have experienced 
the peculiar events which led to his 
adopting the beast as the patron of 



Amber and placing it on his coat of 
arms was, as near as we could tell,' 
a spot now but slightly screened 
from the long view across Garnath 
to the sea — twenty or thirty paces in 
from the upper edge of things: an 
asymmetric glade where a small 
spring trickled from a mass of rock, 
formed a clear pool, brimmed into 
a tiny creek, made its way off to- 
ward Garnath and on down. 

It was to this place that Gerard 
and I rode the following day, 
leaving at an hour that found us 
halfway down our trail from Kolvir 
before the sun skipped flakes of 
light across the ocean, then cast its 
whole bucketful against the sky. 
Gerard drew rein as it was doing 
this. He dismounted then and mo- 
tioned to me to do the same. I did, 
leaving Star and the pack horse I 
was leading there beside his own 
huge piebald. I followed him off 
perhaps a dozen paces into a basin 
half-filled with gravel. He halted 
and I came up beside him. 

"What is it?” 1 asked. 

He turned and faced me and his 
eyes were narrow and his jaw 
clamped light. He unfastened his 
cloak, folded it and placed it on the 
Iground. He unclasped his sword- 
belt and lay it atop the cloak. 

££#''1ET rid of your blade and your 
^jcloak,” he said. “They will 
only get in the way.” 

I had an inkling of what was 
coming, and I decided I had better 
go along with it. I folded my cloak, 
placed the Jewel of Judgment be- 
side Grayswandir and faced him 
once again. I said only one word. 
“Why?” 

“It has been a long time,” he 



60 



GALAXY 




said, “and you might have for- 
gotten.” 

He came at me slowly, and I got 
my arms out in front of me and 
backed away. He did not swing at 
me. 1 used to be faster than he was. 
We were both crouched, and he 
was making slow pawing move- 
ments with his left hand, his right 
hand nearer to his body, twitching 
slightly. 

If I had had to choose a place to 
tight with Gerard, this would not 
have been it. He, of course, was 
aware of this. If I had to fight with 
Gerard at all, I would not have 
chosen to do so with my hands. I 
am better than Gerard with a blade 
or a quarterstaff. Anything that in- 
volved speed and strategy and gave 
me a chance to hit him occasionally 
while keeping him at bay would 
permit me to wear him down 
eventually and provide openings for 
heavier and heavier assaults. He, of 
course, was aware of this also. That 
is why he had trapped me as he 
had. I understood Gerard though, 
and I had to play by his rules now. 

I brushed his hand away a couple 
times as he stepped up his move- 
ments. pressing nearer to me with 
every pace. Finally, I took a 
chance, ducked and swung. 1 
landed a fast, hard left just a little 
above his middle. It would have 
broken a stout board or ruptured 
the insides of a lesser mortal. Un- 
fortunately, time had not softened 
Gerard. I heard him grunt, but he 
blocked my right, got his right 
hand under my left arm and caught 
my shoulder from behind. 

1 closed with him fast then, 
anticipating a shoulder lock I 
might not be able to break; and. 



turning, driving forward, catching 
his left shoulder in a similar 
fashion. I hooked my right leg be- 
hind his knee and was able to cast 
him backward to the ground. 

He maintained his grip though, 
and I came down atop him. I re- 
leased my own hold and was able to 
drive my right elbow into his left 
side as we hit. The angle was not 
ideal and his left hand went up and 
across, reaching to grasp his right 
somewhere behind my head. 

I was able to duck out of it, but 
he still had my arm. For a moment, 
I had a clear shot at his groin with 
my right, but I restrained myself. It 
is not that I have any qualms about 
hitting a man below the belt. I 
knew that if I did it to Gerard just 
then his reflexes would probably 
cause him to break my shoulder. 
Instead, scraping my forearm on 
the gravel, 1 managed to twist my 
left arm up behind his head, while 
at the same time sliding my right 
arm between his legs and catching 
him about the left thigh. I rolled 
back as I did this, attempting to 
straighten my legs as soon as my 
feet were beneath me. I wanted to 
raise him off the ground and slam 
him down again, driving my 
shoulder into his middle for good 
measure. 

But Gerard scissored his legs and 
rolled to the left, forcing me to 
somersault across his body. I let go 
my hold on his head and pulled my 
left arm free as 1 went over. I 
scrambled clockwise then, dragging 
my right arm away and going for a 
toehold. 

But Gerard would have none of 
that. He had gotten his arms be- 
neath him by then. With one great 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN 



61 




heave, he tore himself free and 
twisted his way back to his feet. I 
straightened myself and leaped 
backward. He began moving 
toward me immediately, and I de- 
cided that he was going to maul the 
hell out of me if I just kept 
grappling w ith him. I had to take a 
lew chances. 

I watched his feet, and at what I 
judged to be the best moment I 
dove in beneath his extended arms 
just as he was shifting his weight 
forward onto his left foot and rais- 
ing his right. I was able to catch 
hold of his right ankle and hoist it 
about four feet high behind him. 
He went over and dow'n, forward 
and to his left. 

He scrambled to get to his feet 
and I caught him on the jaw with a 
left hook that knocked him down 
again. He shook his head and 
blocked with his arms as he came 
up once more. 1 tried to kick him in 
the stomach, but missed as he 
pivoted, catching him on the hip. 
He maintained his balance and ad- 
vanced again. 

I threw jabs at his face and 
circled. I caught him twice more in 
the stomach and danced away. He 
smiled. He knew 1 was afraid to 
close with him. I snapped a kick at 
his stomach and connected. His 
arms dropped sufficiently for me to 
chop him alongside the neck, just 
above the collarbone. At that 
moment, however, his arms shot 
forward and locked about my 
waist. I slammed his jaw w'ith the 
heel of my hand, but it did not stop 
him from tightening his grip and 
raising me above the ground. Too 
late to hit him again. Those mas- 
sive arms were already crushing my 



kidneys. 1 sought his carotids with 
my thumbs, squeezed. 

But he kept raising me, back, up 
over his head. My grip loosened, 
slipped away. Then he slammed me 
down on my back in the gravel, as 
peasant women do their laundry on 
rocks. 

There were exploding points of 
light and the world was a jittering, 
half-real place as he dragged me to 
my feel again. I saw his fist — 

T he sunrise was lovely, but the 
angle was wrong ... By about 
ninety degrees . 

Suddenly, I was assailed by ver- 
tigo. It cancelled out the beginning 
awareness of a roadmap of pains 
that ran along my back and 
reached the big city somewhere in 
the vicinity of my chin. 

I was hanging high in the air. By 
turning my head slightly, I could 
see for a very great distance, down. 

I felt a set of powerful clamps 
affixed to my body — shoulder and 
thigh. When 1 turned to look at 
them, I saw' that they were hands. 
Twisting my neck even farther, I 
saw that they were Gerard’s hands. 
He was holding me at full arms’ 
length above his head. He stood at 
the very edge of the trail, and I 
could see Garnath and the 
terminus of the black road far be- 
low'. If he let go, part of me might 
join the bird droppings that 
smeared the cliff face and the rest 
would come to resemble washed up 
jelly fish I had known on beaches 
past. 

“Yes. Look down, Corwin,” he 
said, feeling me stir, glancing up, 
meeting my eyes. “All that I need 
to do is open my hands.”

“I hear you,” I said softly, trying 
to figure a way to drag him along 
with me if he decided to do it. 

"I am not a clever man,” he said. 
“But I had a thought — a terrible 
thought. This is the only way that I 
know to do something about it. My 
thought was that you had been 
away from Amber for an awfully 
long while. I have no way of know- 
ing whether the story about your 
losing your memory is entirely true. 
You have come back and you have 
taken charge of things, but you do 
not yet truly rule here. I was 
troubled by the deaths of 
Benedict’s servants, as I am 
troubled now by the death of Caine. 
But Eric has died recently also, and 
Benedict is maimed. It is not so 
easy to blame you for this part of 
things, but it has occurred to me 
that it might be possible — if it 
should be that you are secretly 
allied with our enemies of the black 
road.” 

“I am not,” 1 said. 

“It does not matter, for what I 
have to say,” he said. “Just hear me 
out. Things will go the way that 
they will go. — If, during your long 
absence, you arranged this state of 
affairs— possibly even removing 
Dad and Brand as part of your de- 
sign — then I see you as out to 
destroy all family resistance to your 
usurpation.” 

“Would I have delivered myself 
to Eric to be blinded and impris- 
oned if this were the case?” 

“Hear me out!” he repeated. 
“You could easily have made mis- 
takes that led to that. It does not 
matter now. You may be as inno- 
cent as you say or as guilty as 
possible. Look down, Corwin. That 



is all. Look down at the black road. 
Death is the limit of the distance 
you travel if that is your doing. I 
have shown you my strength once 
again, lest you have forgotten. I can 
kill you, Corwin. Do not even be 
certain that your blade will protect 
you, if I can get my hands on you 
but once. And I will, to keep my 
promise. My promise is only that if 
you are guilty, I will kill you the 
moment I learn of it. Know also 
that my life is insured, Corwin, for 
it is linked now to your own.” 
“What do you mean?” 

“All of the others are with us at 
this moment, via my Trump, 
watching, listening. You cannot ar- 
range my removal now without re- 
vealing your intentions to the entire 
family. That way, if I die forsworn, 
my promise can still be kept.” 

“I get the point,” I said. “And if 
someone else kills you? They re- 
move me, also. That leaves Julian, 
Benedict, Random and the girls to 
man the barricades. Better and 
better — for whoever it is. Whose 
idea was this, really?” 

“Mine! Mine alone!” he said, 
and 1 felt his grip tighten, his arms 
bend and grow tense. “You are just 
trying to confuse things! Like you 
always do!” he groaned. “Things 
didn’t go bad till you came back! 
Damn it, Corwin! I think it’s your 
fault!” 

Then he hurled me into the air. 
“Not guilty, Gerard!” was all I 
had time to shout. 

Then he caught me — a great 
shoulder-wrenching grab — and 

snatched me back from the preci- 
pice. He swung me in and around 
and set me on my feet. He walked 
off immediately, heading back to 



SIGN OF THE UNICORN

the gravelly area where we had 
fought. I followed him, and we col- 
lected our things. 

As he was clasping his big belt he 
looked up at me and looked away 
again. 

“We’ll not talk about it any 
more,” he said. 

“All right.” 

I turned and walked back to the 
horses. We mounted and continued 
on down the trail. 

T he spring made its small music 
in the grove. Higher now, the 
sun strung lines of light through the 
trees. There was still some dew on 
the ground. The sod that I had cut 
for Caine’s grave was moist with it. 

1 fetched the spade that I had 
packed and opened the grave. 
Without a word, Gerard helped me 
move the body onto a piece of sail- 
cloth we had brought for that pur- 
pose. We folded it about him and 
closed it with big, loose stitches. 

“Corwin! Look!” It was a whis- 
per, and Gerard’s hand closed on 
my elbow as he spoke. 

I followed the direction of his 
gaze and froze. Neither of us moved 
as we regarded the apparition: a 
soft, shimmering white encom- 
passed it, as if it were covered with 
down, rather than fur and maning; 
its tiny, cloven hooves were golden, 
as was the delicate, whorled horn 
that rose from its narrow head. It 
stood atop one of the lesser rocks, 
nibbling at the lichen that grew 
there. Its eyes, when it raised them 
and looked in our direction, were a 
bright, emerald green. It joined us 
in immobility, for a pair of 
instants. Then it made a quick, 
nervous gesture with its front feet, 



pawing the air and striking the 
stone, three times. And then it 
blurred and vanished like a snow- 
flake, silently, perhaps in the 
woods to our right. 

I rose and crossed to the stone. 
Gerard followed me. There, in the 
moss, I traced its tiny hoofmarks. 

“. Then we really did see it,” 
Gerard said. 

I nodded. 

“We saw something. Did you 
ever see it before?” 

“No. Did you?” 

I shook my head. 

“Julian claims he once saw it,” 
he said, “in the distance. Says his 
hounds refused to give chase.” 

“It was beautiful — That long, 
silky tail, those shiny hooves . .” 
“Yes. Dad always took it as a 
good omen.” 

“I’d like to myself.” 

“Strange time for it to 
appear . All these years . ," 

I nodded again. 

“Is there a special observance? It 
being our patron and all . Is 
there something we should do?” 
“If there is. Dad never told me 
about it,” I said. I patted the rock 
on which it had appeared. “If you 
herald some turn in our fortunes, if 
you bring us some measure of 
grace — thanks, unicorn,” I said. 
“And even if you do not, thanks for 
the brightness of your company at a 
dark time.” 

We went and drank from the 
spring then. We secured our grim 
parcel on the back of the third 
horse. We led our mounts until we 
were away from the place, where, 
save for the water, things had 
become very still.

“h: 

into the 



row long,” asked Chiet Ed- 
Iward Longlegs, Sr., staring 
ne mirror and centering the 
war bonnet on his head with both 
hands, “am I supposed to sit 
around here saying ‘ugg’ and ‘how' 
like some kind of savage?” 

He adjusted the feathered train 
to fall exactly between his shoulder- 
blades. then glanced at his grand- 
son's relleclion in the mirror. 

"As long as it takes," answered 
Ambassador-at-large Ed Longlegs, 
Ilf. scrutinizing his grandfather’s 
costume and frowning. “There’s 



still something wrong." 

Chief Longlegs looked at 
himself. Boots. Fringed leather 
pants and jerkin with authentic 
Hopi beadwork. Authentic Sioux 
war bonnet. He looked up at his 
grandson. 

"Looks O.K. to me." 

The Ambassador shook his head, 
unconvinced. “I can’t quite put my 
linger on it. Somehow, you don’t 
look indian enough.” 

Chief Longlegs grunted. “Been 
an injin all my life." 

"But you don’t look it.” 



66 





Chief Longlegs peered into the 
mirror. His weathered face and 
hooked nose went well with the 
bonnet. "Best lookin’ injin 1 ever 
seen.” 

“It’s not your face." 

“What is it?" 

The Ambassador brightened, 
pointing. “Your boots." 

Chief Longlegs lifted one foot, 
examining the boot. “What’s the 
matter with my boots?" 

“They aren’t authentic.” 

"They’re gen-u-wine Mexican 
leather.” 

“I can see that." 

"Hand tooled." 

“1 can see that, too. But who- 
ever heard of an indian wearing 
cowboy boots?" 

"Me. I worn’em all my life. On 
(he reservation, even’body wears 
'em." 

The Ambassador showed his 
exasperation. “Grandfather, we 
aren’t on the reservation. We have 
to impress a few palefaces.” 

“Ain’t no difference between 
palefaces and most injins no more. 
Take you, for example. You ain’t 
no more an injin than . 
than . ." Chief Longlegs waved 
his hand in a great arc in front of 
him, indicating the ship around 
them and the Moon ahead. 
". them critters out there.” 

"Aliens." corrected Ambassador 
Longlegs. 

“Whatever you call ’em, they 
ain’t injins and neither are you.” 
Chief Longlegs jerked his thumb 
over his shoulder. “I seen you back 
there in Washington powwowin’ 
with the big wigs. Do you call him 
Great White Father ever now and 
then so’s he remembers you’re an 



injin?” 

“I call him Mr. President like 
everyone else.” 

A laugh erupted from Chief 
Longlegs, a curt, sarcastic laugh. 
He pointed an accusatory index 
finger at his grandson. “You see! 
You ain’t no injin! Any self- 
respectin’ injin would throw in a 
few Great-White-Fathers just to 
keep’cm guessin’.” Chief Longlegs 
snorted and chuckled, enjoying his 
grandson's discomfort. Eventually, 
he subsided. "Where was we any- 
ways?" 

“Your costume. Are you sure 
everything else is authentic?” 

"More or less.” 

The Ambassador frowned. 
“What do you mean, more or 
less?" 

“You called me at the last 
minute, you know.” 

“I know. So what?” 

“So 1 had to scrounge around.” 
He touched the bonnet. “This 
here’s Sioux, but it’s authentic 
Sioux, they tell me, and this . .” 
He touched the leather jerkin. 
“. .is Hope-eye. or most of it any- 
ways. Some of them beads is plastic 
and put on by machine, but them 
designs is supposed to be Hope-eye, 
and — " 

"Is «//vthing Apache?” 

"What do you care? You 
wouldn’t know an Apache from a 
Sioux if one bit you.” 

The Ambassador shook his head, 
incredulous. “None of it is 
Apache?” 

“Not much. If you’da given me 
more time — ” 

“We didn’t have more time. Now 
take off those cowboy boots and put 
on some moccasins.” 



67 




“Ain’l got no moccasins.” 

‘‘ Then go barefoot.” 

“Barefoot!” 

"It has to look authentic and 
cowboy boots,” said Ambassador 
L.onglegs, “don’t.” 

“But barefoot does.” 

“It’s better than nothing.” 
Grumbling, Chief Longlegs 
reached down and began tugging at 
his left boot. It came off easily. The 
right one stuck. 

“Gimme a hand here, half- 
breed.” said Chief Longlegs, ex- 
tending his right leg. 

“Grandfather, please stop calling 
me half-breed.” 

“That’s what you are, ain’t it? 
Half while man, half injin.” 

“I’m a full-blooded Apache just 
like you.” 

Chief Longlegs grunted. 

“What’s that grunt supposed to 
mean?” 

“No full-blooded Apache would 
of treated no injins the way you 
treated them injins.” 

“What injins — I mean, in- 

dians?” 

“In New York. They just wanted 
their rightful tribal land back, but 
you — you Uncle Tom-Tom — you 
skinned ’em out of it for the Great 
White Father.” 

“Graz/t/father, they wanted Man- 
hatten back.” 

“Don’t matter." 

“Sometimes you’re very difficult 
to talk to. grandfather.” 

Chief Longlegs grunted. 

"And what's that supposed to 
mean?" 

“It means my leg's gettin’ tired 
sticking out here in the air. Take 
off the boot.” 

The Ambassador grabbed the 



heel and toe of the boot and jerked. 

“ Watch it! You’re gonna rip off 
the leg." 

“Sorry.” 

W hile watching his grandson 
struggle with the boot, Chief 
Longlegs began to doubt the 
wisdom of accepting the boy's 
offer. If he were incapable of re- 
moving a simple boot (the leg was 
twisted and jerked; sweat blossom- 
ed on his grandson’s forehead), 
how would he be at saving the 
human race, palefaces included? 

Initially, when his grandson 
phoned from Washington, Chief 
L.onglegs had been reluctant to 
accept the call. For months after 
the Manhatten incident, Chief 
Longlegs had gone around denying 
kinship to the boy. When asked if 
he were related to the Ed Longlegs 
who sold out the indians holding 
Bedlow Island, he usually tried to 
suggest the Ed Longlegs involved 
was a Seminole. No relation. Ac- 
cepting the phonecall might ac- 
knowledge the kinship. Still, the 
boy was kin. Acknowledging it. 
Chief Longlegs was forced to 
acknowledge something else about 
his grandson. In spite of the boy’s 
Harvard education — perhaps be- 
cause of it — he was a dumb injin. 
In Chief Longlegs’ opinion, nothing 
was w'orse than a dumb injin, ex- 
cept a dumb paleface. He had 
taken the call. 

When the boy explained the 
situation, that alien lifeforms had 
occupied the Moon, completely 
rending Tranquility Base and 
destroying any approaching ships 
or missiles from Earth, that the 
President wanted Ed Longlegs, the 



68 



GALAXY 




successful negotiator in the Bedlow 
Island incident, to talk to them and 
strike a bargain, that Ed Longlegs 
wanted Chief Longlegs to accom- 
pany him — w'hen all this was ex- 
plained, Chief Longlegs called the 
boy a dumb injin to his face and 
hung up. 

The boy called back. He 
pleaded, saying this was the finest 
opportunity in modern times to 
demonstrate indian wisdom. Chief 
Longlegs replied that wise red men 
stayed on the reservation when 
green men threatened White men. 
The boy said the world was in 
danger. Chief Longlegs said 
indians alw'ays lived with danger.] 
The boy said the family name 
would be enhanced. You mean, re- 
sponded Chief Longlegs, the career 
of Ed Longlegs would be enhanced. 
Yes, admitted his grandson, the 
grueling climb to the presidency 
would be shortened. 

Why, inquired Chief Longlegs, 
me? 

Because, answered the boy, the 
government is desperate. 

T he governments of the United 
States and the Soviet Union had 
tried everything to contact the 
aliens. When radio communication 
proved fruitless, they sent out am- 
bassadors. Each time an ambassa- 
dor's ship settled into parking orbit 
around the Moon, the aliens 
blasted it. Ed Longlegs, seeing an 
opportunity to save mankind and, 
incidently, enhance his career, had 
sold the President on the idea of 
Chief Edward Longlegs, Sr., 
possessor of ancient indian lore, 
gleener of sacred mystical insights, 
a man in complete harmony with 



himself and nature, a man so 
serene rattlesnakes only bit him 
when forced to at gunpoint — in 
short, a man capable of communi- 
cating with anything, terrestrial or 
extraterrestrial. 

Chief Longlegs, mulling over the 
description, had hesitated, re- 
membering his last encounter with 
a rattler. The snake had plunged its 
fangs into Chief Longlegs’ calf, and 
if it had shown any emotion at all, 
it certainly was not a sense of co- 
ercion — more like delight. 

Finally, Chief Longlegs spoke. 
Me? 

Yes, you. 

But — 

All of it, assured Ed Longlegs, 
was simply a deception, a harmless 
ruse to let the boy get into a posi- 
tion to talk to the aliens and save 
the world. Did Chief Longlegs, 
after all, disapprove of deceiving 
palefaces? 

Of course not, replied Chief 
Longlegs, but he did disapprove of 
situations tending to endanger 
Chief Longlegs’ life. 

The boy assured him he could 
rest easily. At Harvard, they had 
taught Ed Longlegs, 111, to handle 
any situation. 

In spite of himself, Chief Long- 
legs found the mystical insights 
taught at Harvard persuasive. Plus, 
he liked the idea of deceiving pale- 
faces, whether pale white or pale 
green. Besides, he would get a free 
trip to Washington and a ride in a 
rocketship, if that was what they 
called them. It would divert him 
from the daily grind of haggling 
with the Japanese import company 
that supplied the pot shards he sold 
the archaeologists. He accepted.

W atching the boy yank at his 
boot, feeling the pain it 
caused in his hip. Chief Longlegs 
rather doubted the wisdom of 
accepting. 

“Here," said Chief Longlegs, 
withdrawing his boot from his 
grandson’s hands and hiking it on 
his knee, “let me do it.” 

He pulled on the heel, pointed 
his toe and extracted his foot. 

Ambassador Longlegs wiped his 
forehead with his sleeve. “O.K. 
Let's go.” 

“Where?” 

“The bridge. We’re almost 
there.” 

Chief Longlegs followed his 
grandson into the corridor. They 
took the elevator, riding in silence. 
During most of the trip from Earth, 
Chief Longlegs had ridden in 
silence. He felt like a prisoner, for- 
bidden to leave his cabin. The boy 
had said it would strengthen his 
image — add authority — if he were 
held off stage until the crucial 
moment, then brought in like a 
savior. 

Chief Longlegs gave less than a 
hoot in hell about his image. He 
wanted to see the spaceship. He 
had an idea for painting pot shards 
so the archaeologists would think 
the Apaches were descended from 
space travelers. It would boost 
sales. But he needed authentic de- 
signs. To get them, he had to see 
the ship. Even when he explained 
the situation to the boy, simply and 
clearly, his grandson kept him in 
the cabin. Harvard had done some- 
thing to the boy’s values. 

The door opened onto the 
bridge. In front of them, a figure, 
its back turned, stood in the center 



of a wide panorama of glass win- 
dows, staring out at the Moon 
below. The figure heard the hiss of 
the opening door and glanced 
around, simultaneously telling one 
of the numerous men seated at the 
bridge console to keep an eye on the 
planet. 

“He think it’s goin’ some- 
wheres?” whispered Chief Longlegs 
and chuckled. 

“Shh," said his grandson. “Re- 
member, only Apache.” 

“Ahh,” said Captain Carapa- 
lida, approaching them with a 
hand outstretched toward Chief 
Longlegs, “Ambassador and Chief 
Longlegs.” He grasped Chief Long- 
legs’ hand in both of his, shaking it 
vigorously and peering deeply— al- 
most reverently — into his eyes. “I 
was about to call you two. We’re 
almost ready to take a parking 
orbit around the Moon.” The Cap- 
tain grinned. 

“What's he grinning at?" asked 
Chief Longlegs in Apache. 

“ The responsibility shifts to us as 
soon as we're in orbit. ” 

The Captain, eyebrows raised, 
glanced at Ambassador Longlegs. 
“What’s he say. Ambassador?” 
“He wants to know if the escort 
ships are still with us.” 

Captain Carapalida returned his 
attention to Chief Longlegs, 
nodding his head in an exaggerated 
arc and speaking in a raised voice. 
“yes, sir. they are, sir.” 

“Tel! him I'm not deaf. " 

“He's not deaf." 

“Oh," said the Captain, fluster- 
ed. “Sorry. If you’ll come over 
here, you can see our escort.” 
Chief Longlegs followed the two 
men to the center of the wall of 



70 



GALAXY 




glass. In'front of them, the Moon — 
from their angle, half full — hung in 
space like a lunar globe. Even what 
was left of Tranquility Base, which 
showed on lunar globes as a dot, 
showed on the Moon as a dot. To 
either side, ships identical to their 
own. bubble-nosed giants dragging 
three long tubes and sporting com- 
plicated arrays of solar panels, 
paced them, approaching the 
Moon. Only their ship carried the 
spidery LEM. 

“When do they usually blast 
ambassadors ?" asked Chief Long- 
legs. 

His grandson glowered. 

"What’s he say?" asked the Cap- 
tain. 

'"He wants to know when we 
enter the danger zone.” 

“We’re in it." 

Hesitantly, the Ambassador re- 
sponded. “I see. 1 think I’d better 
consult with my grandfather.” He 
continued in Apache. “What do we 
do now?" 

“How the unhappy-hunting- 
grounds am I supposed to know?" 
Hell was a difficult word to trans- 
late into Apache. 

“ You're the wise-man, aren't 
you?" 

“You're the Harvard man, aren't 
you?" 

“Grandfather, this is a serious 
matter. Try to think of some new 
approach. Mankind needs time. " 
He pointed out the viewports at the 
Moon. “Those creatures have the 
technological capability of coming 
here from the stars, then destroying 
our great birds like they were tiny 
Jlys, " 

"What do you mean by great 
birds?" 



“Spacecraft,” said the Am- 
bassador in English. 

“Oh. I always use heavenly canoe 
myself. ” 

“Whatever you call it, they can 
destroy it. We have to buy time 
until we've reached equality with 
them. ’’ 

“First things first. We don’t even 
know if they're still out there. They 
may have gone home. You might 
try talking to them. ” 

“Good idea. Captain, is it pos- 
sible to contact these creatures?” 

“Sure.” The Captain turned to a 
technician and ordered a visual and 
audio channel to the surface. When 
it was established, he turned back 
to the Ambassador. “That’s the 
frequency the Ruskies used. They 
got thirty seconds of good talk in 
before the creatures blasted them.” 

Chief Longlegs noticed his 
grandson swallow. 

"O.K. We’ll try it. Where do 1 
stand?" 

"Anywhere. The monitor camera 
will pick it up and feed it into the 
communications link.” 

Ambassador Longlegs threw out 
his chest and stepped forward, 
staring at the Moon and raising his 
right hand, palm out. 

“We come in peace,” he said, 
“for all mankind.” 

Two beams of blue light shot up 
from the surface. The escort ships 
(lamed — incandescent blue balls — 
and vanished. 

“I guess, " said Chief Longlegs, 
watching the dying sparks from one 
of the explosions, “that was a bad 
idea. 

Ambassador Longlegs, much too 
stunned to speak, nodded agree- 
ment.

“Let me tty, ” said Chief Long- 
legs. 

Shaken from his stupor, the Am- 
bassador looked at Chief Longiegs. 
“You?" 

“ What do we have to lose?" 

“ Our lives?” 

"Chicken-livered, eh?” said 
Chief Longiegs, rather proud of the 
translation. 

“Prudent. ” 

“Look, I can't do any worse than 
you did. ” 

“How do you figure?" 

“ You lost two heavenly canoes, 
right?” 

His grandson nodded. 

“I can only lose one. ” 

“ Grandfather , in case you hadn't 
noticed, we’re on that one.” 

“I noticed, ” said Chief Longiegs, 
stepping forward. “Out of my 
way. 

Chief Longiegs raised his right 
hand to the Moon. “How. " 

He squinted, examining the 
planet’s surface for an answering 
burst of blue light. None came. En- 
couraged, he continued. 

“This is Chief Edward Longiegs 
talking. What are you foreigners 
doing on our hunting grounds?” 

"Grandfather, we’re not even 
sure they know English or Russian. 
I'm sure they don 't know Apache. " 

“ Are they shooting ?“ 

Ambassador Longiegs fell silent. 

"Listen here, palefaces, ” con- 
tinued Chief Longiegs. “You go 
hunt the heavenly buffalo on some- 
body else’s ground. You got that?” 



S uddenly, a meter in front of 
Chief Longiegs, the air shim- 
mered, resolving itself into a crea- 



ture, a humanoid bi-ped, feathered 
from crest to claws. It reminded 
Chief Longiegs of a cross between a 
Hopi Kiva dancer and a parrot. 
The beak protruded like a ma- 
caw’s. Apparition, wondered Chief 
Longiegs? Holographic projection? 
Perhaps the creature itself, tele- 
ported to the bridge of the ship? 
Hard to tell. 

Seeing it, the crew panicked, 
fleeing. They packed themselves so 
solidly into the bridge elevator that 
the last man, a sweating fat man, 
had to scale the front rank and be 
held aloft by the other passengers. 
The elevator door closed, leaving 
only the Captain and the two Long- 
legs. 

The creature’s beak, flanked by 
two squinting eyes, clacked like 
wooden blocks when it spoke. 

“We will meet with the feathered 
one. " it said, its Apache, except for 
the clacks, accentless, glancing at 
some object hidden among the 
feathers on its wrist, “at ,twenty- 
three hundred Greenwich Mean 
Time. " 

The apparition vanished. 

after the ship’s doctor gave Am- 
bassador Longiegs a mild 
sedative. Chief Longiegs and his 
grandson returned to their cabin to 
prepare for the descent to the sur- 
face. Chief Longiegs, noticing his 
grandson’s chagrin at being sur- 
passed in his area of expertise — 
diplomacy — decided to gloat. 

“You see,” said Chief Longiegs, 
changing out of his beaded suit and 
into the white NASA jumpsuit pro- 
vided by the Captain, “you just 
gotta know how to talk to them 
critters.”

GALAXY 




“Grandfather,” said Ambassa- 
dor Longlegs, zipping up his own 
jumpsuit, “stop gloating.” 

“I ain’t gloatin’. I’m just tellin' 
you how it is. If they’d have taught 
you a little more mystical injin 
wisdom at Harvard, you’d know 
that.” 

“You don’t know any more 
about mystical indian wisdom than 
I do.” 

“I know them critters ain’t 
shootin’.” 

They finished dressing in silence. 
Chief Longlegs, tired of walking 
barefoot on the cold metal decks, 
fearful of arthritis, slipped on his 
cowboy boots, then replaced his 
war bonnet, positioning it securely. 
“How do I look?” 

“Ridiculous. That war bonnet 
and those boots don’t go with the 
jumpsuit.” 

“Tough.” 

"You’re going to wear them any- 
way." 

“Yep.” 

“Why?” 

“So’s they’ll know me from you. 
We probably all look alike to them 
critters.” 

“When we get down there, let me 
do the talking.” 

“They want to talk to me, re- 
member, the feathered one.” 

“Do you know' anything about 
ambassadorial work?” 

“They ain’t shootin’. That’s all I 
gotta know'.” 

The cabin phone hummed. Am- 
bassador Longlegs touched it on. A 
technician’s face appeared. 

“Lasereom from the White 
House.” 

“Put it on.” 

The President’s face, gray-haired 



and distinguished but clearly 
burdened, came on the screen. 

“Ed,” said the President, 
nodding. 

"Mr. President.” 

“This is a serious situation.” 

“1 agree, sir.” 

The President’s gaze went past 
Ambassador Longlegs to the bunk 
behind. “Is that your grand- 
father?" 

“Yes, sir." 

“An impressive figure. Does he 
speak English?” 

“Only Apache. As I told you at 
our conference, sir, he is untainted 
by modern civilization.” 

"I see," said the President. He 
then raised an open hand to Chief 
Longlegs. “How.” 

Chief Longlegs responded from 
the bunk. “Ugg.” 

The President’s attention return- 
ed to the Ambassador. “The Cap- 
tain has told me of your initial con- 
tact with the creatures. At first, I 
was dubious of your suggestion. 
Your grandfather, sagacious as he 
no doubt is, seemed the wrong dip- 
lomatic tool for the job. However, it 
seems to be proving out. We must 
continue the strategy. When you 
get on the surface, I want you to let 
your grandfather do the talking. 
They seem to be willing to listen to 
him. I have obtained full authority 
from every country in the United 
Nations to let him make any agree- 
ment he feels is justified. We need 
time, Ed, to gain technological 
parity with these creatures. Your 
grandfather has to get us that time. 
Do you understand?” 

"Yes, sir.” 

"Good luck.” 

The screen went blank.

They left the cabin and proceed- 
ed to an airlock, transferring to the 
landing vehicle. The plan called for 
a geodesic air dome to be erected 
on the surface and filled with an 
Earth-normal atmosphere. The 
creatures could use their apparition 
to enter the dome. 



^trapped into his seat, war 
jjbonnet on his lap. Chief Long- 
legs began to plan his negotiation 
strategy. The LEM dropped away 
from the underside of the larger 
ship and began falling toward the 
Moon. The LEM pilot, talking in 
numbers, relayed data to the ship. 
Below them, the cratered surface 
grew. Chief Longlegs, hard at work 
on his plan, ignored it. When his 
grandson asked about the plan. 
Chief Longlegs answered, “1 figger 
I’ll treat this critter just like an 
injin agent.” 

They neared the surface and shot 
over the crater-pocked terrain. 
Eventually, the alien craft, a 
rickety-looking structure like an oil 
derrick surmounted by a sphere, 
came into view. The pilot landed, 
settling the LEM two hundred 
meters from the derrick, then 
pushed the geodesic dome-shaped 
button on the control panel. 

A noise erupted from the side of 
the LEM. Startled, Chief Longlegs 
peered out the port. A ramp was 
just touching ground below him. A 
cart rolled down the ramp onto the 
surface of the Moon. It stopped 
after a hundred meters and seemed 
to explode metal bars. Arms 
quickly extruded from the cart, 
catching the bars and rapidly be- 
ginning to build the dome frame. 



Once complete, the cart sprayed 
the frame with plastic from a hose 
with a blunderbuss nozzle, con- 
nected the dome to the LEM with a 
plastic tunnel and retreated ten 
meters, stopping. A green light 
came on in the LEM. 

“Ready,” said the pilot. 

“Let's go, grandfather. ” 

“What do you mean, let’s go?" 
Chief Longlegs indicated himself 
with his thumb. “The bird wanted 
to talk to me. ” 

“Yes. but — ” 

“And, the white- chief-in- Wash- 
ington did say I was supposed to do 
the talking. ” 

“I know, but — " 

“No buts. I 'm going alone. " 
Before his grandson could ob- 
ject, Chief Longlegs, grabbing a 
voice activated document printer, 
found the entrance to the plastic 
tunnel and started for the dome. 
Though he realized the act might 
look like courage to the pilot, his 
actual motive in bolting the LEM 
was to jettison his grandson. Mys- 
tical Harvard wisdom or no mysti- 
cal Harvard wisdom, the boy 
lacked sense. He would only 
antagonize the bird into blasting 
them. 

Chief Longlegs emerged inside 
the dome and put on his war 
bonnet. Almost immediately, the 
feathery apparition shimmered and 
solidified. It raised one clawed 
hand. 

“How,” it clacked. 

Chief Longlegs, glad to see the 
creature had learned English at 
last — Apache lacked words for 
some of the things they would be 
forced to talk about — responded 
with a raised hand. “O.K. How

you?” 

“Fine. What do you want with 
us?" 

“What do.you,” said Chief Long- 
legs. “want with us?” 

“We intend,” clacked the feath- 
ered emissary with a candor Chief 
Longlegs could but admire, “to 
take all of the usable worlds in this 
arm of the galaxy.” 

“That sounds reasonable. Can I 
ask why?” 

“It is our destiny, our manifest 
destiny.” 

Somewhere, Chief Longlegs had 
heard the phrase before. He 
shrugged, unable to pinpoint the 
source. Sizing up his adversary. 
Chief Longlegs decided they were 
critters who both spoke the same 
blunt language. 

“What say we skip all the Har- 
vard niceties and get down to busi- 
ness. I gotta proposition.” 

“What kind of proposition?” 
asked the creature, the eyes, next to 
the beak, narrowing. 

They got dow n to business. Chief 
Longlegs offered, the bird rejected. 
The bird offered. Chief Longlegs 
rejected. After several hours of 
tedious detail w'ork. Chief Longlegs 
had to admit the bird was a hard 
bargainer, harder than the Japan- 
ese pot shard company, harder 
than the indian agent, harder even 
than the archaeologists. Still, the 
bird reacted enough like them to let 
a bargain — rough but adequate — 
be struck. 

They drew up a voice-printed 
document and signed, the bird’s 
talon mark next to Chief Longlegs’ 
X. 

Chief Longlegs rolled his copy of 
the treaty into a tube, picked up the 



voice-printer, and started for the 
tunnel. He hesitated at the en- 
trance, a question forming in his 
mind. 

He glanced back. “By the way, 
how come you critters agreed to 
talk to me and blasted everybody 
else?” 

“We saw' your feathers and took 
you for human.” 

Chief Longlegs, his curiosity 
satisfied, made his way back to the 
LEM. It lifted off, hopping up to- 
ward the orbiting spacecraft. 
During the trip. Ambassador Long- 
legs read the treaty, his scowl deep- 
ening with each paragraph. 

“Grandfather,” he said as they 
approached the mothership, “this 
is the worst treaty I have ever seen. 
You gave away everything .” 

“Yep.” 

Angry. Ambassador Longlegs 
shook the document, jabbing at a 
middle paragraph with his free 
hand. “Look at this, grandfather. 
Mankind is restricted to Sol’s four 
inner planets for a hundred years!” 

"Yep.” 

“1 can’t show a treaty like this to 
the President,” protested Ambassa- 
dor Longlegs. “It’s man’s destiny to 
own the stars. We can’t just . 
just . He threw up his hands. 
“. .stop! You've made the inner 
planets into some kind of . .” His 
hands continued to wave. “. 
“. reservation!" 

“Yep.” 

“Is that all you have to say, yep? 
What am / supposed to tell the 
President?" 

“Tell him I got faith in him. 
When the time comes, the Great 
White Father will know how to 
break a treaty.” ★

can remember when the years 
l changed, I can remember when 
(rode a horse of a different tech- 
nicolor. Now when 1 feel like having 
a woman, 1 have myself changed 
into one. You remember me. I was 
Mr. and Mrs., 1 rode across your 
screen. I danced for you. I fell off 
horses for you. I got shot for you. I 
was living in two worlds and Jesus 
Christ was working the night shift. 
When they said do a rain dance, I 
did a rain dance. When the dance 
called for a woman, I was one. You 
remember me, don’t you? If you 
do, tell me who I am. Am I the 
book? The movie? I can remember 
w hen I rode a horse of a different 
technicolor. I’m making sense to 
you, yes I am, unless I am a movie 
and you are a book. 

The universe is divided into two 
worlds. Now' the appeal of two 
worlds is the fear of death. One 
world is the book and there it is 
written, “All lives are to be divided 
into two sections, day and night.” 
The other world is the microphone 
and the camera and there it is re- 
corded for playback, shining to us, 
“I am the kingdom and the glory. 
Let the children come unto me for 
they shall be recreated in my own 
image.” 

It all began in 2074. Twice. Once 
for day and once for night. This 
story began in 2074 where prece- 



dence became the word as it was 
spoken, the word. Man learned 
that all men had to rechannel their 
aggressions. They invented spec- 
tators. They said people should be 
great and disinterested souls. We 
know the past. We must act accord- 
ingly. Yes, let us act accordingly. 

T he year 2074 was the year of the 
success, the all-inclusion, the 
triumph of the wait-and-watch. 
They learned how to make people 
act accordingly. (Do you remember 
when you w'ondered whether the 
people you watched on television 
could watch you. Now you know, 
don’t you?) And 2074 happened 
twice. Once in the soil and once in 
the spirit and they all began acting 
accordingly. Next year will be the 
third year 2074 happened. 2074 will 
alw ays be with us. That is what they 
said. Did you listen? 

I listened and did not learn. I 
couldn't be the language, couldn’t 
hide in the same time, couldn’t 
stand for the old or whisper soft 
things counting me to sleep like 
tallied sheep. They pushed my 
button. I know they pushed my 
button. 1 heard the connections 
made in my brain. 1 died in my 
sleep and was changed into 
someone else on a silver screen. I 
used to be a book. I’m a lie. I know 
I’m a lie but I am very important.

B lack holes have no hair, but 
they’re fuzzy. Because they’re 
l tizzy. they’re not really black. 

We haven't space for a chatty

would. 

This month we’re giving Galaxy 
readers a scoop. Our lag time is 
shorter than most science journals, 
so you'll learn why black holes

Last month 1 told you that if a 
chunk of matter gets squeezed 
small enough, it becomes a black 
hole. That's about three kilometers 
radius for our Sun. The equation 
for the radius, r, in centimeters is 
r = 2GM/c 2 
(Equation 1)

for mass M in grams, G the uni- 
versal gravitation constant, and c 
the velocity of light. 

W'e call the region that satisfies 
equation one the Schwarzschild 
radius. Inside it gravity has become 
so strong that nothing including 
light, can escape. Also inside it 
lurks a singularity that does strange 
things to time and casuality. [For a 
fictional treatment of this theme 
see “The Schwurzkind Singu- 
larity, ” this issue. — Baen ] 

If you watched a star collapse 
you’d never see it get quite so small 
as that. Instead it would appear 
that the collapse had slowed down 
and everything was now hovering 
just outside the Schwarzschild 
radius. The light would get redder 
and redder, and also dimmer and 
dimmer, and in milliseconds it 
would go out. 

Since nothing can come out of 
the hole, we can’t see in. We call 
the region from which nothing can 
escape the “event horizon,” and 



83 




we’ll never know what happens in- 
side because of the law of cosmic 
censorship. If you want to know 
more about that, read last month’s 
column. 

^■^lassical black hole theory 
^.dictates several laws of black 
hole dynamics. Some aren’t too 
interesting, but the Second Law 
says the area of the event horizon 
can never decrease, and increases 
as matter and energy are pumped 
into the hole. This means that 
black holes never get smaller. Feed 
the matter and/or energy and they 
grow. 

That lets us deduce one thing in- 
stantly. What happens if a normal 
matter and an anti-matter black 
hole collide? Well, nothing that 
wouldn’t happen if two normal 
matter holes, or two anti-matter 
holes, collided, of course. The holes 
eat each other to form one larger 
than either, but we’ll never know 
which ones contain normal or anti- 
matter. In fact, the question is 
meaningless. 

You see, black holes have no 
hair. 

This is a convenient way to say 
that everything we’ll ever know 
about a black hole can be deduced 
from three parameters. Once you 
specify the mass M, the angular 
momentum J, and the electric 
charge Q, you’ve said it all. 
Nothing remains but location, 
which isn’t important for the phy- 
sics of the hole, but may be for the 
physicist who wants to study it. 

Mass we understand. It doesn’t 
really matter whether that mass is 
in the form of energy or matter; 
Einstein’s e = Mc2 takes care of 



that, and down in the hole it’s irre- 
levant w hether the rest mass is e or 
M. 

Angular momentum comes from 
rotation of the object before it 
collapsed. Naturally it’s conserved, 
so that if the star were rotating, the 
thing inside the hole rotates as well. 
It also rotates fast, just as a skater 
speeds up in a spin when she pulls 
her arms in. 

The last parameter, charge, is 
just w'hat it says, and it gives us a 
way to move a black hole around. If 
it isn’t charged, feed it charged 
particles until it is, then use mag- 
nets to tow' it. 

The laws of black hole dynamics 
say you can never recover the rest 
mass energy (that’s the Mc2 
energy, of course) of the original 
body. It’s lost forever. Even shoving 
anti-matter down the hole gains 
you nothing. 

However, you can get energy out 
of a spinning black hole. Up to 
29% of the rotational energy is 
available, and in the case of a star 
that’s a lot. To get it you throw 
something down the hole, and one 
of the things that comes out is 
gravity waves. 

In our experience gravity waves 
are puny things, but we’re a long 
way from their source. Up close is 
another matter entirely. You could 
be torn apart by them, as the char- 
acters in my story. He Fell Into a 
Dark Hole, very nearly were. 

Most of what we know about 
black holes comes from Stephen 
Hawking of the University of Cam- 
bridge. Many physicists think 
Hawking is to Einstein what Ein- 
stein was to Newton, and he’s still a 
young man. This year Hawking has 



84 



GALAXY 




added quantum mechanics to 
classical black-hole theory, and 
he’s ruined a lot of good science 
fiction stories. 

omewhat over a year ago Larry 
jJ^Niven and I went out to Hughes 
Research Laboratories in Malibu. 
The laser was invented at Hughes, 
so of course they do a lot of laser 
research there. They’re also among 
(he top people in ion drive engines, 
and they’ve done a lot with ad- 
vanced communications concepts. 

All that was fascinating, but we 
went to talk with Dr. Robert For- 
ward, who’s known as one of the 
experts on gravitation. I’d met him 
because he liked my previously 
mentioned black hole story (nomi- 
nated for a Hugo last year, but 
alas . .) and had been kind 
enough to call and tell me so. 

Bob Forward is the inventor of 
(he Forward Mass Detector, a 
widget that can track a tank miles 
away by mass alone. It can’t distin- 
guish between a tank at a mile and 
a. tly on the end of the instrument, 
but if you use two and triangulate 
you’re safe enough. His detector 
can also be lowered into oil wells, or 
lowed behind an airplane to map 
mass concentrations below. 

After lunch we talked about 
black holes. Dr. Forward was par- 
ticularly interested in Stephen 
Hawking’s then-new notion that 
tiny black holes might have been 
formed during the Big Bang of 
Creation. Since the Second Law 
predicts that they never get smaller, 
there should be holes of all sizes 
left. Some might be in our solar 
system. 

They would come to rest in the 



interior of large masses. There 
might be quite a large one inside 
the Sun. for example — and in the 
Earth and Moon as well. A hole of 
very large mass, say 10 exp 8 kilo- 
grams, would still be tiny: about 10 
exp -19 centimeters radius. An 
atomic radius is around 10 exp -9 
cm., very large compared to such 
a hole, so that the hole couldn’t eat 
many atoms a day, and wouldn’t 
grow fast. 

Readers will note that I’m being 
kind to typesetters. Obviously 10 
exp -19 means 10 to the minus 19 
power, just as 10 exp 8 means ten to 
the eighth. I’m using this conven- 
tion because we had sad experience 
with the “Belter” column some 
time ago; between the typesetters 
and the printing some of the 
column made no sense. Galaxy 
readers who don’t understand 
powers of ten notation should go 
find a highschool (new highschool; 
they didn’t teach that in my day) 
text and learn, because you can’t 
deal with very large or very small 
numbers without it. 

Anyway, black holes inside the 
Earth or Sun aren’t too useful be- 
cause they’re hard to get at. Bob 
Forward wanted to go to the 
asteroids. You search for a rock 
that weighs far too much for its 
size. Push the rock aside and there 
in the orbit where the asteroid used 
to be you’ll find a little black hole. 

You could do a lot with such a 
hole. For example, you could 
wiggle it with magnetic fields to 
produce gravity waves at precise 
frequencies. There might be all 
sizes of holes, even down to a kilo- 
gram or tw'o. 

It sounded marvelous. Larry and

I figured there were a dozen stories 
there. I’d already written my black 
hole story, and Larry hadn’t, so he 
beat nie into print with a thing 
called The Hole Man. All I got 
from the trip was a couple articles 
and columns. 

Well, Larry’s story has just been 
reprinted in his new collection, 
while the columns I did about little 
black holes have been forgotten — I 
hope! 

I’m glad 1 have nothing in print 
about tiny black holes, because 
Hawking has just proved they can’t 
exist. Oh, they can be formed all 
right, but they won’t be around 
very long. It seems that black holes 
aren’t really black. They radiate, 
and left to themselves they get 
smaller all the time. The Second 
Law needs mosifying. 

S tephen Hawking’s new paper 
hasn’t been widely published 
yet because he submitted it to this 
year’s Gravity Research Founda- 
tion prize essay contest. The GRF 
was founded by Edison’s friend, 
stock market analyst Roger Bab- 
son. It’s been around for many 
years, and received scornful treat- 
ment in Martin Gardiner’s Fads 
and Fallacies in the Name of 
Science. It may or may not have de- 
served that in the 50’s, but for a 
number of years the leading people 
in gravitational theory have been 
entering the competition. 

Hawking won first prize from 
GRF in 1971 with his paper on 
cosmic censorship and black hole 
dynamics. This year he took only 
third prize, first going to a Cal 
Berkeley astronomer. Even third 
prize was enough to tear Larry’s 



The Hole Man to shreds. (Not that 
Hawking ever mentioned science 
fiction; but then the Pioneer probes 
weren’t intended to wreck all our 
stories about Jupiter, either.) 

Hawking points out that Ein- 
stein’s general relativity, which pro- 
duces most of the primary equa- 
tions for black holes, is a classical 
theory. It doesn’t take quantum ef- 
fects into account. 

Hawking corrects this. In 
quantum theory a length, L, is not 
fixed. It has an uncertainty or fluc- 
tuation on the order of L 0 /L, where 
L 0 is the Planck length 10 exp -33 
cm. 

Since there is uncertainty in the 
length scale, it follows that the 
event horizon of the black hole isn’t 
actually fixed. It fluctuates through 
the uncertainty region. 

In fact, the black hole is FUZZY, 
and energy and radiation can 
tunnel out of the hole to escape for- 
ever. It’s the same kind of effect as 
observed in tunnel diodes, where 
particles appear on the Other side of 
a potential barrier. 

Since black holes have no hair, 
although they do have fuzz, the 
quantum radiation temperature — 
that is, the rate at which they 
radiate' — must depend entirely on 
mass, angular momentum, and 
charge. 

It does, but I’m not going to 
prove it for you. Hawking uses 
math that I can tool up to follow, 
but I’m not really keen on Her- 
metian scalar fields, and I doubt 
many Galaxy readers are either. If 
you want his proof, send a dollar to

ing’s paper Black Holes Aren't 
Black. 

Hawking shows that the temper- 
ature of a black hole is, 

T = (10 exp 26) /M °K 
(equation 2) 

where M is mass in grams, and the 
lifetime of a black hole in seconds is 
tL = (10 exp -28) M3 
(equation 3) 

Using my new Texas Instruments 
SR-50 that handles scientific nota- 
tion and takes powers and roots in 
milliseconds, it wasn’t hard to work 
up Table One from these 
equations. 

There are more numbers than 
we need, of course. It’s a conse- 
quence of the pocket computer. 
Not long ago I'd have had to use 
logs and sliderule, and I’d have 
done no more than I needed. Now 
look. 

The first thing to see is that small 
holes have uninteresting lifetimes. 
In order for one to be around long 



enough to use it, the hole must be 
massive. 

Any black holes formed in the 
Big Bang would be 10 exp 10 years 
old now ; so if they weren’t larger 
than a small asteroid they’re gone 
already. Worse, that exponential 
decay rate defeats us even if we find 
a hole just decayed to an interesting 
size. It w ill still vanish too fast to 
use. 

So there w'ent Larry’s Hole Man , 
and two stories I had plotted but 
hadn't written, and I suspect a lot 
of other science fiction as well. 
Sometimes 1 feel a bit like Alice 
when she protested, “Things flow 
here so!" 

But it's w hat we get for living in 
interesting times, and it ought to 
teach my friend Larry not to rush 
into print ahead of me . 

t^t ext month Velikovsky, and I 
hope I have some friends left 
after that one’s out.

W. S. DOXEY 



B eyond the outskirts of Ramur 
the elephants at last pulled off 
on the shoulder of the highway and, 
sounding my brass horn by way of 
saying Phhooot! for all the precious 
lime not to mention trouble they 
and their handlers had cost, I 
downshifted to third and picked up 
speed, seeing in my mind’s eye 
what awaited me at kilometre 8, a 
mess of badderlocks fried in safoil 
and perhaps one or two cold glasses 
of excellent frog-toddy. 

Oh yes, I was exercising my 
mind’s eye quite well, thank you, 
when rounding a downward sloping 
hill what should I have to drag both 
feet to avoid dashing into but a 
squat structure of gray stone piled 
up in a rather clumsy imitation of 
ashlar masonry. 1 mean the bloody 
centrestripe ran directly up to, and 
I supposed, under the oak door, 
above which hung a small brass bell 
shaped rather like an irregular star. 
Well. 

I caught my breath and dis- 
mounted, feeling my brake pads 
while doing so and noting that the 
sudden stop had caused them to 
heat rather much. I recalled not 
without dread that I hadn’t any 
extras. (Since the region beyond 
Ramur is hilly this fact was of great 
importance.) Of course, I could al- 
ways improvise — had done so with 
amazing success in other races — in 
fact was known by some sports- 
writers as the Great Improvisor. 

Still, I hadn’t planned to waste 
so much brake material on a build- 
ing that had absolutely no business. 



that I could then determine, block- 
ing the road. I mean there were 
cliffs maybe ten metres tall on 
either side — solid granite with a 
hint of diorite — and the structure 
was jammed in between. In my 
mind’s eye I saw myself laboring to 
get myself and the racing bike up 
the front wall and across the slate 
roof. That would drain quite a bit 
of speed from my gluteus maximus, 
medius and minimus and might 
well cause mild coxalgia, which 
racers must avoid at all costs. 

Of course I was prepared; in my 
carry-all 1 had thoughtfully stowed 
crampons and claws — not to men- 
tion rings, pinions, pulleys, and a 
length of nylon rope. 

So I dismounted, caught my 
breath, and considered the door, 
underneath which, as I have al- 
ready stated, the yellow centre- 
stripe seemed to run. Doors are not 
what you would call my best 
friends. In previous races my 
record against them is rather dis- 
mal. The first which confronted me 
I opened with optimism and had 
my innocent smile bashed in by a 
lurking medicine ball, placed there 
by my enemies, of whom I was at 
that time unaware. And — to sum- 
marize with one last example — 
there was the ornate mahogany 
door on the route from Ciudad 
Juarez to Belize, behind which 
waited a slightly ravenous ana- 
conda Eunectes murinus. Close 
call, yes, thanks to an anabatic 
breeze from the Gulf of Honduras. 

But getting back to this door, the 



89 




one smack in the middle of the 
highway beyond Ramur. 

Well, 1 rang the star-shaped bell, 
stepped back, hands to the front, 
set for anything, anything at all. 

I heard voices. Chanting. I 
listened. Schoolboys, it sounded 
like and, yes, they were reviewing 
the Curie-Weiss Law, by rote 1 
supposed. 

So I knocked and rang the bell 
again. 

Not that I’m anti-education. But 
my lead in the race, while good, 
wasn’t impossible for a determined 
foe like Kip or even Pretorius to 
overcome. And the elephants had 
delayed me. 



rriHE door opened inward. I 
I followed the stripe across the 
threshhold, where it ducked under 
a pair of neat, tan oxfords. My gaze 
elevated. By golly, standing before 
me was a splendid little chap wear- 
ing a handsome fawn-colored suit, 
with spots, tailored of, I judged, 
pina cloth. Around his neck 
dangled a silver chain and whistle, 
of the type used aboard warships. 
His face was rather round and 1 
noted immediately his curious 
gyrus. 

“Yes?” said he. 

“1 beg your pardon,” I replied, 
“for interrupting, however — .” 

“You are sweaty, quite.” 

"Yes, well, actually I’ve involved 
in this — .” 

“Bicycle race, I assume, seeing 
that you have such a machine with 
you.” 

His blue eyes twinkled. I peered 
past him at the classroom. Sure 
enough, the yellow centrestripe 



continued dowm the aisle between 
the desks, then climbed the wall 
several feet, and leaped out an open 
window. Upon the chalkboards 
Hanking this opening were neatly 
printed such marvelous bits of info 
as: 

40 bushas = one R 

and: 

1000 tils = 1 JD 
as well as: 

myristic ACD = CH x (CHy) z COOH 
“As a matter of fact, he said, 
“we are preparing for recess.” 

The students nodded. 

“During which time we shall be 
most happy to help you.” 

Having seen the dusty portrait 
hanging in the lefthand corner be- 
side what seemed to be a worn 
Christmas tree was that of Baden- 
Powell, I said, "Jolly decent of 
you." 

“You are wondering about the 
highway,” he declared. “I shall ex- 
plain. The Department of Public 
Werke changes the roads around 
for variety. Cuts accident rate, they 
claim, by breaking monotony. Be- 
ware of all road signs — seldomly 
mean what they say.” 

“Confusing,” I said. 

“Perhaps, until one knows. But 
rest assured — eventually you will 
reach your destination, perhaps 
sooner than expected.” 

1 glanced over my shoulder. 
"Maintaining a slight lead, eh?” 
he said. 

“And getting slighter. See here, 
all of this is most stimulating, but 
what can I do? Mind if I duck 
through the window and be on my 
way?” 

“What? Without sharing our 
hospitality?"

A fine looking young lad wearing

“We have some splendid sagger

Another declared: “And a

“Saggers will be adequate, with a 
whiskey sour, of course,” said their 
teacher. And having so ordered the 
boys he turned back to me and con- 
tinued. “We must help you.” 

“I was doing well enough by my-

He frowned. “I was not so much

"Would be contrary to his philos-

The class came to attention. 

“To the armory, double-time,

They moved off smartly through

“Not foes, competitors.” 

“As you like.”

now. Through the window. Follow 
the highway. You are equipped?” 
“For anything,” I replied. 
“Excellent!” He extended his 
hand. "Luck!” 

“And you,” 1 said. 

T here were questions 1 longed to 
ask; however, the open window 
beckoned, and in moments 1 was 
once more in the race. The highway 
beyond the building rose quickly to 
a hilltop. At the summit I glanced 
back and saw the students, sans 
uniforms, formed up in several tri- 
angles flanking the road down 
which Kip and Pretorius would 
soon be coming — unless during the 
lag between myself and them the 
Werke Department had rerouted 
and by their quirk- put those two 
ahead of me. 

Well, that thought made me 
think of w'hat to do. 

My trusty Onflichter .19 was 
strapped with scope, bipod, and 
shell-case to the crossbar. If things 
became too critical I was allowed to 
try for a rim or chain shoot. Of 
course, should I miss and draw 
blood I’d be disqualified. 

But I hadn’t a target, yet. So I 
settled for another measure by 
pulling to a halt and breaking out 
the ketch-rig sails. That was the 
right move! The mountain wind 
puffed out the blue and green gala 
sail, and away 1 went, feet resting 
on the pedals. 

I had time to observe the land 
through which 1 raced — an ex- 
perience rarely experienced. Cow- 
berries w ere in season. Their purple 
flowers blended well with the white 
moschatel and pachysandra, while 
repant oxalis formed a splendid 



reseau through which peeked a host 
of snakeroots. 

Abruptly, the wind died and the 
highway left this altiplano in a 
breathtaking descent which de- 
manded all my cycling skill. Reef- 
ing and furling with one hand, 
steering with the other, I negotiated 
the twists and turns through 
gathering shadows, till 1 passed 
through a layer of refreshingly 
moist cloud and fairly popped like 
a cork from vintage champagne, 
perhaps Rothchild ’47 or Funder- 
burk ’51, on to an eight-lane con- 
crete freeway, bathed in the pink 
tones of a setting sun. 

Adjusting my course to the third 
lane from the right, I bent low over 
the silver BeFortage handlebars 
and endeavored to make up for lost 
time, all the while keeping one eye 
on the rearview' mirror, just in case. 

The freeway rolled on and I with 
it for several kilometres, then it 
narrowed like a bottle’s neck, 
wheeled left, rose, lessened again to 
eyedropper size, turned into a dirt 
path, and brought me to a curious 
wooden bridge hung across some 
sort of dark gorge, out of which 
came the tumult of struggling water 
and a great deal of vapor, remind- 
ful perhaps of lilac or owl’s-clover, 
if you know' what I mean. 

So, there was this bloody bridge, 
a fitting spot for a murder. I tested 
it with one foot. It swayed but 
otherwise seemed sturdy enough. 
Still, no use to risk all. I looped my 
rope over a thick oak limb close by, 
ran the rope through the steel 
safety link on my all-purpose belt, 
knotted it neatly, and allowed the 
untied portion of the nylon to play 
out of my pack, through my 



92 



GALAXY 




fingers, and back to the limb. 
Thus, if I should plunge into the 
gorge, 1 could pinch off the free end 
and make my way out, having, of 
course, secured my bicycle by 
gripping the frame between my 
legs. 

However, 1 reached the other 
side without having to put this plan 
into effect. As 1 drew in and re- 
coiled my rope the idea came to fix 
the bridge in such a way that it 
would cause Kip and Pretorius a bit 
of trouble. Not that 1 dreamed of 
cutting the supports clean through! 
Half-way would be good enough. 

But I resisted this impulse, and 
since it was now after sundown, 
switched on my head and tail lamps 
and followed the highway, which 
began to widen a bit and to show 
signs of halfhearted attempts at 
paving. On either side the 
shoulders were buttressed with im- 
mense piles of scoriae. Atop of one 
the beams from my lamp illumined 
a host of Centruoides gracilis medi- 
tating upon the moon, which even 
now was making its slow rise 
through the stars. 

Ah, that was a tranquil leg of the 
race! 

But then the beeper pinned to my 
blouse informed me that 1 was 
hungry, and there was neither 
drive-in nor cafe in sight, nor sign 
promising one, till I made the next 
turn and found myself coasting to- 
ward a massive steel gate which, 
luckily, swung inward to admit me. 

1 was in a park of some kind. 
Yes, 1 plainly made out in the glow 
of quaint iron lamps beds of flowers 
and at least six fair sized Dragon 
frees in full bloom. The driveway, 
upon which 1 rolled seemed to be of 



brick, perhaps in the Roman style. 
At any rate, there was no going 
back for the gate slammed behind. 

And so I went on, noting Poin- 
cianas, Jackarandas, and Quamas 
in orange, purple and silver bloom, 
hearing the soft little cries of sapa- 
jous, the moans of howler monkeys 
and, thanks to my amazing sco- 
topia, seeing in the darkness a 
pleasant enough pond whose beach 
was festooned by legions of 
parading yellow and blue crabs. 

at last, however, the drive ended. 

I stopped before a bucolic 
cottage made of white cinchona 
and, I supposed, satin wood. 
Brushing a few pesky Zancudos 
from one eye, my left, I dismount- 
ed, set the McGregor “Standfast” 
kickstand, and knocked upon the 
door. 

It opened immediately. 

"Yes?” said a rather large 
woman, naked save for rings on her 
ankles, very large rings, of gold, I 
judged. 

“Ahum,” I began. 

“You’re with the race,” she de- 
clared. “Come in.” 

“How could you know that?” I 
started to say. But didn’t. Some- 
thing was up, I sensed it. Yes, no 
doubt she was in the pay of my op- 
ponents. I must be on guard. 

And so I went in. 

My beeper beeped again. 

“Hungry?” she said. “I have just 
the dish for you.” 

“Of poison?” I almost replied. 
But then what should 1 hear but 
laughter of a most pleasing sort. It 
seemed to come from a large red 
and blue mail box beside the 
hearth. 



THE SCHWARZKIND SINGULARITY

“Oh dear, aren’t they having a 
good time, though?” she said. “I 
mean my girls. Not mine, really, 
but my students.” 

“This is a school of some kind?” 
“But of course! What did you 
suppose?” 

“I had not, till now.” 

She beckoned with her meaty 
hand. The mail box swung back to 
reveal a damp stone staircase light- 
ed by sputtering torches. “Shall we 
go down? The girls will want to 
make your acquaintance, and there 
is food available too. Please, you 
first." 

I hesitated, then plunged down 
the stairs which opened onto a 
narrow corridor cut from living 
rock. After several twists we came 
to a huge chamber. Red and green 
lights burst off and on like pulsing 
stars. I blinked, then saw in various 
comfortable positions upon the 
floor a host of delightful young 
women and not a few men, who 
seemed rather fatigued. They were 
engaged in such play as one might 
observe in Masters & Johnson’s 
Haiidbuch. Tw'o absolutely perfect 
misses were playing ride-the-horsey 
with two gentlemen. I don’t know 
what came over me, perhaps I 
wasn’t thinking clearly due to the 
trials of the race, but without a 
moment’s delay 1 rushed over and 
almost became guilty of involuntary 
Gomorrah. 

She giggled and exclaimed, 
“Better luck next time, handsome!” 
My hostess laughed and clipped 
me a good one on the backside, say- 
ing, “My sentiments, exactly!” 
“Yes, well,” 1 fumbled, “it’s 
been a long day, and — ” 

Language, handmaiden of 



Thought, failed. 

I mean w'hat should 1 notice up- 
on the dangling foot of one gentle- 
man but, yes, a recognizable shoe! 
Purple upper crafted of shark 
leather; gold neoprene laces; sole of 
woven hemp. Done special by Ad- 
didas these shoes were, and for 
whom? Why, the eleven man crew 
of ZEP Santos-Durmont, known 
more commonly to those who 
followed the dirigibles as ZEP-88, 
odds-on favorite to win the Trans- 
world Lighter-than-Air Derby. But 
it had disappeared, vanished, and 
the squat DlR-512 Pin Ip had come 
in first, paying sixteen-to-one. 

“And you are starving,” said the 
hostess, handing me a bowl from 
w hich spun wisps of steam smelling 
rather like pumpkin. “This is our 
favorite dish," she said. “Don’t be 
bashful. Plenty where that came 
from.” 

I did not dare ask where, exactly, 
it had come from. But sat down on 
the floor and gobbled it down,, 
without looking. 

1 must say that actually it wasn’t 
half-bad, whatever it was. I felt in- 
vigorated, revitalized, and so, 
putting the bowl aside, got the 
attention of the fellow I’d spotted 
and said', “By the way, the weather 
out is splendid. And that’s a very 
interesting shoe you’re wearing.” 

“I am barefoot,” was his only 
reply. 

Seeing that he did not par- 
ticularly care to converse, I 
shrugged and glanced about the 
chamber. In one corner stood a 
large, glass-fronted case in which 
were arranged not a few objects, 
two of which caught my eye. Now, 
the lighting was not good, but since

my vision is perfect I am quite sure 
(hat they were the shirts of my op- 
ponents. The silver and gold 7/1 
numerals of Kip were very plain, as 
were the 4/4 in burnt orange and 
forest green of Pretorius. 

Well, I was on the brink of 
pondering this turn when my hos- 
tess pulled me up and said, “Come, 
I'll show you our class rooms." 

She drug me through any 
number of spacious rooms devoted 
to such pursuits as horticulture and 
synesthesia and canon law. At last 
wc arrived at a laboratory where 
several lovely young ladies were 
conducting an experiment not un- 
known to me. They were having 
some difficulty, so I stepped in and 
said: 

"Your problem is that the jelly- 
fish, Cyclosalpa pinnata, must be 
oriented east-west upon the pewter 
dish, like so. And now. if you will 
give me the metal rod. Thank you. 
Behold!" 

I tapped the edge of the dish. A 
brilliant phosphorescent light 
sprang from the specimen and 
threw our shadows in stark relief 
along the wall. 

I acknowledged their applause 
with a simple nod and, not wishing 
to overstay my welcome said, “It’s 
getting late and I am involved in a 
race. Best hit the road, you know." 

“Nonsense!” cried the lady. 
“You must spend the night. It is 
snowing on Chimborazo. The pass 
will be blocked." 

“There are ways of circumvent- 
ing snow." 1 began. 

“Naturally, 1 anticipated you 
would act thusly,” she said, “and 
so, for your own good and the sake 
of the race, 1 slipped a little some-

thing extra into your food. Aren’t 
you drowsy in the least?” 

Before 1 could answer I fell 
asleep. 

Perhaps I dreamed. 1 usually do. 
But 1 cannot recall of what 1 
dreamt. 

1 awoke with the dawn outside 
the iron gates. A tray of break- 
fast was on the soft grass beside 
me. My bike stood waiting. 

I, of course, ignored the food and 
downed three low-fat racing pills 
stowed in the carry-all. Then, 
having checked tire pressure and 
brake cables, mounted up and 
spun away, at the same time 
wondering how I could’ve missed 
the left turn which, last night, 
would’ve enabled me to avoid the 
girls’ school and its terrible delay. 
Soon, however, the road steepen- 




THE SCHWARZKIND SINGULARITY

ed and all my energy was required 
for pedaling, so 1 turned off my 
mind. Up, up, up into the dark 
clouds I drove myself, lungs burst- 
ing, gasping for oxygen. A sign 
edged in black said: “chimborazo 
straight ahead.” 

There was snow, of a sugary 
kind, and ice. I stopped to put on 
chains, then rattled off again, ex- 
pecting the worst, at least. 

But no, the road dipped down, 
down, down, and in moments I 
sped through a pleasant pasture 
grazed by an enormous herd of 
springbok. It was then I noticed 
something extremely curious. My 
shorts were gone. 1 stood on the 
pedals to make sure. Yes, no 
doubt, they were totally gone. 

Someone, some — , I mused. But 
of course! The trophy case! The 
shirts and now my shorts! A 
dastardly trick, but I could not re- 
press a smile, which, incidently at- 
tracted a large purple butterfly who 
smacked into my white teeth. 

Luckily, they had not taken my 
"John Henry” supporter, so I was 
in no real danger. Unless I hap- 
pened through a village populated 
by prudes or appreciative ladies or 
alert homosexuals or — 

Perhaps I was in some danger. 
But so be it. Part of the game of 
racing, and if it came to a show- 
down, well, I was a crack shot with 
the Onflichter .19. Wouldn’t catch 
me with my — that is, well. 

And so, head down, legs wheel- 
ing, 1 drove myself onward, raising 
behind a wonderful plume of dust. 
The road signs promised ice and 
slippery surfaces, soft shoulders, 
dangerous curves, so 1 knew I had 
nothing to fear. 



However, when before me 
loomed a baby blue and pink sign 
saying “clear sailing ahead, 
don’t worry,” I applied brakes 
and skidded to a halt before a 
broad river. 

The water ran deep, the water 
ran dark. 1 fancied green eyes peer- 
ing up from the depths. The other 
shore, if there was one, was 
shrouded in gray mist. Periodically 
a moan rose remindful of fog 
horns. 

I laughed. 

The lengths to which these 
people went to make their race 
interesting was absolutely amazing! 
And I had expected something of a 
marvellous challenge near the end. 
What better than a forbidding 
aqueous expanse? 

Whistling a merry tune, from 
Reichmark’s Donner und Blitzen, I 
believe, I quickly inflated my all- 
purpose gum rubber raft, fitted the 
bike aboard, tensed the guy wires, 
and shoved off, carefully shifting 
into low gear so as to counteract the 
current’s sweep. 

I passed the wreckage of several 
wheeled vehicles, one of which 
might have been a bicycle. Another 
1 recognized as a curricle — yes, the 
drowned horse was still between the 
traces. A seagull perched upon his 
head and nodded back as I passed. 

Into what? Why, the mist, of 
course, and beyond, into clear 
golden sunshine and a spotless 
white highway neatly landscaped 
with cedars. Ah, the odor was a de- 
light! But the road, there was some- 
thing familiar about it — yes, it 
looked to be exactly the same bit of 
highway that started the race! 

Of course, 1 couldn’t be sure. 



96 



GALAXY 




But I sensed I was almost to the 
finish of the race, and to' another 
victory, for Kip and Pretorius were 
nowhere to be seen.- 

Ping! 

Ping! Ping! 

I steered into a convenient hay- 
cock and took cover, at the same 
time checking my person and 
equipage. 

Zing! 

“Close, but no cigar!” I yelled. 

There were telltale dimples on 
the rim of my rear wheel. 

Zing! 

Ping! 

Ouch! Shot zigged off my hel- 
met. Ears rang. I rubbed my eyes 
and sneaked a peek through the 
hay. Something moved in the cock 
twenty yards away. Yes, motion, 
and now came the glitter of a rifle 
barrel. At a glance I saw the unique 
ribbing and horn sights character- 
izing the Dinkier .21. 

Kip was potting me, or — I saw a 
flash of gold — no, it was Mrs. Kip, 
his mother. 

Rats! 

Of all the lousy luck, to be 
pinned down by that woman! I 
mean she was really overprotective. 
The hay parted a bit more and I 
saw her clearly, saw the gold ring in 
her nose, saw even the green 
patterned haik she always wore — 
had something to do with the Kip 
tribe. 

“Mrs. Kip, dear lady, it’s only 
me!” 1 called out. 

By way of reply she fired twice 
into my straw and hissed, “I know, 
that’s why I’m shooting.” 

1 frowned, then smiled. “Does 
this indicate that your son has not 
yet passed this point?” 



“Ask him when you see him!” 

Aha, 1 reasoned. Kip had not yet 
passed. 1 was in the lead, provided 
of course Pretorius was behind Kip. 

“You are forcing me to take 
measures!” I cried. 

Zing! 

Well, I had warned her. It was 
out of my hands now. I considered 
trying to pot her with my .19, but 
recalling the great meals of hawks- 
bill soup and filigumbo she’d 
rustled up for us in happier times, 
and taking into account the fact she 
was, after all. Kip’s mother, 1 de- 
cided on a less final solution. 

I fired my SOS rocket in a care- 
fully determined trajectory so that 
after bursting it would float down 
on her hiding place, then settled 
down to wait. In moments 1 heard 
the sirens, then the whish-whish of 
the choppers, as they winged in at 
tree level to give aid. 

They dropped their huge steel 
grapples into the hay. On the 
second pass they hooked Mrs. 
Kip — I decline to say where — and 
sped off for home base. 

And once more I was on my way 
down the homestretch, riding hell- 
for-leather for the checkered flag. 

But I had to stop at an eight-foot 
chainlink fence, beyond which, 
through scrub pine and palmettoes, 

1 could see the track on which we 
had to finish. 

Now what was I to do? I mean 
the road ran directly into the fence. 
And I had no way of knowing if the 
wire was safe. 

I was standing there, chin in 
hand, when I heard a bell ring, 
ring, ringing. Coming down the 
road toward me was a figure on a 



THE SCHWARZKIND SINGULARITY 



97 




bike! I shaded my eyes! Merciful 
heavens, there were two figures! 

Kip was bent low over the 
handlebars, and behind him, rising 
now on the seat to get a clearer 
look, was Pretorius. Apparently, 
they had joined forces against me. 1 
heard them yowl, laugh, saw Pre- 
torius shake his fist and urge Kip 
on to greater exertion. 

Well, things did not look very 
good. I mean, the two of them 
working together could get over the 
fence quickly, and then- — 

1 shuddered to think of them 
taking the flag. 

So 1 took immediate steps to 
insure they would not by simply 
falling on the group, grasping my 
right thigh, and moaning. 

They slid to a stop. Kip bounded 
over the bars and hit the pavement 
running. Pretorius steadied the 
bike and smirking, said to me, 
“Looks like you’re out of it, eh?” 
“Help me, please.” I implored. 
"Sure," said Kip, “we’ll screw 
up your other leg.” 

They moved up to the fence. I 
called out, “Stop! The wire may 
well be electrified!” 

That gave them pause, but only 
for a moment. “You’d like us to be- 
lieve that, wouldn’t you?” said Pre- 
torius. “You’d like us to waste time 
here while you recover, wouldn’t 
you?” 

“He’d like it,” said Kip. 

“Well, we won’t!” exclaimed 
Pretorius, bending over and 
making a cup of his hands. “Here, 
Kip, I’ll give you a boost.” 

Quite a boost it was. 

I mean, the voltage made a de- 
lightful rainbow through Kip’s 
body into Pretorius’ and thence 



into terra firma. I let them stand 
there like glowing statues for a 
minute, or at least until the circuit 
breaker up the line blew out and 
the wires went dead. They seemed 
welded together, but I detected 
breathing and eye flicker. They 
would soon be ready to ride again, 
so 1 had to hurry. 

Over the fence went my bike, 
followed by me. 

The brambles and weeds clutch- 
ed at my bare flanks, but I was not 
to be stopped this near victory. No, 
I reached the track, righted my 
bicycle, found the proper gear, and 
took off. 

Let me say right now that this 
track is really two tracks in one or, 
to be more exact, a pair of ovals 
forming a figure eight. At the start 
of the race each rider had first to 
make one complete circuit then exit 
for the crosscountry via an escape 
road at the pinch, or narrows, as 
the spot w'here the ovals join is 
called. 

All right. 

1 found the entrance lane at the 
narrows and followed the track, 
pulling myself together in fine rac- 
ing form to oblige the hordes of 
media representatives which, I 
knew, would be milling with 
cameras and mikes at the end. Oh 
yes, 1 really moved out, around one 
oval into the other, around it, and 
in the distance made out the finish, 
the wooden stand hung with patrio- 
tic bunting, even heard the rumble 
of the crow'd. 

Only as 1 came flashing closer I 
saw something wasn’t quite right. 

I mean the banner above the 
track didn't read F-l-N-I-S-H. 



98 



GALAXY 




No, instead it bore the letters 
S-T-A-R-T. 

I slowed, pondering this, then 
speeded up again, reasoning that 
there was actually no real problem. 
The course was a circuit; therefore, 
the end was the same as the be- 
ginning. 

And so, standing up on the 
pedals and giving the overhead 
clasped hands sign of victory, as 
well as my most photogenic smile, 1 
crossed the line of shadow cast 
down by the banner, slowed to a 
gentle, graceful stop, and awaited 
the mob’s welcome. 

Silence. 

Somewhere beyond the stands in 
the woods a bird made a cackling 
sound. 

I looked to the judges’ stand. 
They sat fanning their sweaty faces 
with palm fronds. 

“Ah, 1 say there,” said I. “Beg 
pardon, but did 1 come by so — ha- 
ha — fast you didn’t notice?” 

Lord Klutz, chief judge and pub- 
lisher of the Beaver State Racing 
Bugle, looked down upon me and, 
yawning, declared, “My dear 
fellow, you're a bit late, don’t you 
think. The race began days ago. 
Why, at any moment we expect the 
winner.” 

Another judge, 1 believe it was 
Dinzu Xblit. Knight of Asphodel 
and Keeper of the Seal of Blinn, 
said, “Has he had his shots? Is his 
passport in order?” 

I was on the point of making 
reply when the crowd loosed its 
finest roar. 

The checkered flag fell. 

Kip and Pretorius crossed the 
line. 

My protest was disallowed, the 



ruling handed down being that two 
men on one bicycle did in no way 
constitute a breech of the peace and 
in fact showed great resourceful- 
ness, not to speak of grit. So the 
bronze trophy was cut down the 
middle, as was the cash prize, and I 
was left with nothing. 

In fact. I was left with somewhat 
less. 

My finish so amazed everyone 
that by unanimous vote 1 was de- 
clared invisible, the reason being 
that I had gone in the wrong direc- 
tion, reversing time in a most sin- 
gular manner and attaining, for 
now at least, a prodigious mass 
which precluded the reflection light 
and, consequently, rendered me a 
dark spot. 

I could not stand for this treat- 
ment! 

And so I remounted and com- 
menced to rerun the race, chasing 
my own shadow, as it were and, I 
hasten to add, catching it just 
before Kip and Pretorius set out. 

as i accepted the trophy and 
granted exclusive interview 
rights to several reporters, my op- 
ponents foamed. “Schwarzkind, 
you are a cad!" Pretorius opined. 

“And a cheat!” said Kip. 

“Perhaps,” 1 replied, “but I have 
beat you again. And, as usual, I am 
a star. Eat your hearts out.” 

This they fell to doing, while I 
signed endorsements for baby food 
and the Quark Motorcoach Com- 
pany, Ltd., of Panama City, 
Panama, securing enough in the 
twinkling of a pen to insure my par- 
ticipation in the next race, which 
was even then being sonorously an- 
nounced from the judges’ stand. ★

By the twenty-first century the by many as secret pleasures. Most

the world had led to severe restric- 
tions on reproduction even among 
the wealthy. A woman who had 
borne two children was required by 
law to have any subsequent preg- 
nancies aborted. 

ART RODNEY, California elec- 
tronics engineer and chessmaster, 
finds that his' wife, RITA, has fled 
to Chicago to locate a midwifer and 
bear a third child rather than have 
the abortion required by law. Art 
pursues Rita to convince her that 
her plan is both wrong and dan- 
gerous before it is too late. 

Art's transcontinental tube train 
is halted at the Mississippi. Under 
attack there by rioters is a monas- 
tery of Christians (a sect long in de- 
cline) where experiments on pre- 
serving life in freshly aborted 
fetuses are thought to be under 
wav. Art helps a distraught girl 
named ROSAMOND JAMISON 
get- on the train for Chicago. 

In Chicago, Rita s brother 
GEORGE PARR, a karate master, 
and his wife ANN, LIVE LIKE 
many other city dwellers in a com- 
plex of townhouses fortified against 
the random violence of the age. Art 
arrives to find that Rita has come 
and gone, leaving the two Rodney 
children with Ann, a militant tree- 
birth advocate and Christian. 

Art convinces the Parrs that he 
must be allowed to talk to Rita face 
to face. George takes him on a tour 
of the city, supposedly to arrange 
the contact but really to confuse 
any Family Planning agents who 
might be watching them. High 
points on the tour are a stadium 
where the unemployed are paid to 
watch baseball, and a slumburb 
tavern where Art hears a disheart- 



ening broadcast of world news. 
George takes Art to his karate dojo 
where Fred, who wants George to 
hire him as an instructor, has come 
to be evaluated. Fred fails in com- 
bat against humanoid karate-ma- 
chines. One of George's students. 
Dr. Hammad, is introduced to Art 
as the man who can arrange his 
meeting with Rita . 

Fred, gloomy and wounded, goes 
in search of some gladrags ( opaque 
plastic cloaks) to facilitate his 
planned sublimation- affair with 
Marjorie. At the Megiddo Coffee 
House Fred falls in with some apish 
companions. 

A meeting is arranged between 
Art and his wife, who is in hiding 
while her anonymous doctor, an ac- 
quaintance of Dr. Hammad’s, 
makes preliminary tests. Art is 
blindfolded and driven to see Rita 
in the former nurses' quarters of a 
maternity hospital— that with the 
changing times has been converted 
into a sublimation-brothel. When 
Art realizes his beloved wife is stay- 
ing in a whorehouse he tries to drag 
her out by force but the bouncers 
subdue him. Exhausted, he is 
almost seduced into sublimation by 
one of the girls, who takes him for a 
customer. Desperate now, he de- 
cides to take his problems to 
Family Planning and throw himself 
and Rita on their mercy. 

Outside, opposing picket lines of 
the Homo League and the radical 
Young Virgins clash as Art arrives 
at the building. In the lobby, he 
finds he cannot betray Ann and 
George to the law as the midwifery 
conspirators they are; he dashes out 
again, and is knocked unconscious 
in the riot.

Musing at home about Art’s and 
Rita's problems, George and Ann 
hark flashback to their own meet- 
ing and early life together; George's 
saving Ann from apes on a Califor- 
nia bus, and their first sublimation 
together, on the night she missed 
her high school's orgiastic Senior 
Prom. We see what has only been 
implied earlier, that to members of 
this society the deliberate refusal 
( repression , sublimation) of a 
sexual impulse can sometimes be a 
transcendental experience, intense 
and important as orgasm was in an 
earlier age. 

Art wakes up in a hideout where 
the Young Virgins have brought 
him, having mistaken him for one 
of their own casualties as they fled 
the riot scene with the arrival of the 
police. Art is being treated by a 
Christian priest-doctor on the lam 
for midwifery— in fact the very man 
who is about to deliver and freeze 
Rita's fetus. While waiting for a 
skull X-ray, Art notices a glassy 
tank and, peering within, discovers 
a three-month-old human fetus . 



T he surrounding light was quite 
dim, and the tank’s only 
window a tiny aperture that allowed 
a clear view of the thing only from 
certain angles. 

Art stepped closer, staring, then 
abruptly relaxed. There was no um- 
bilical cord, only a blind knot of 
tissue at the navel. For a moment 
he had thought that the complex of 
equipment before him (besides the 
tanks and piping, there were three 
oscilloscopes, counters, and other 
gear that Art could not immediate- 
ly identify) was in fact an artificial 



womb, and that the fetus before 
him had been frozen and revived, 
or was at any rate in some sense 
viable. But now he realized that it 
must be only an abortus being used 
in some experiment. Tubes, or only 
wires perhaps (he could not be sure 
in the dim light) were attached to it 
inside the tank, but without an 
umbilical cord, he supposed, it 
could not be receiving oxygen and 
nourishment. And he could see no 
placenta, or analogue of one. 

There it sat, or rather floated in 
an upright sitting posture. The 
thing that so much fuss was made 
about. It was small, only about the 
length of Art’s middle finger. Its 
proportions were much different 
from those of a normal full-term 
infant, and of course even further 
from those of an adult, but the 
thing was unmistakably genus 
homo all the same. What other 
species would develop a bulging 
brow like that, or hold up two such 
human hands? When Art bent 
closer, the fingers were fully distin- 
guishable, as were the toes at the 
end of the insignificant legs and 
feet. What with the shadows and 
the angle of his view, the sex was 
not quite visible. 

He jumped back a step with a 
quick intake of breath, and only 
then was aware of the doctor stand- 
ing watching him at the corner of 
the screen a couple of steps away. 

“Feel all right?” the doctor 
asked. “You shouldn’t be on your 
feet unnecessarily.” 

Art raised a hand to gently touch 
the side of his head, at a good safe 
distance from the wound. He 
turned his gaze back to the tank. 
“It moved.”

“Oh yes, they move. I’ve located 
the X-ray film at last. Get back on 
the cart if you will and we’ll finally 
be able to make sure about that 
head of yours. Yes, the little girl in 
there happens to be about the same 
developmental age as Rita’s fetus is 
right now. About three months as 
near as I can tell. At that age 
they’ve usually been moving spon- 
taneously for several weeks, though 
the mother usually can’t feel the 
movements yet.” 

Art walked away, pausing at the 
corner of the screen to look back 
once. “I didn’t know it was . 
there was no cord.” 

The doctor held out a hand to 
give support if needed. “Oh. But 
we usually take that off at parturi- 
tion. Tapping into the circulatory 
system elsewhere serves the 
purpose, and has some technical 
advantages. Yes, she’s very much 
alive and growing. That’s her heart- 
beat you can hear in the back- 
ground, sounds like a clock or 
watch? And with those scopes back 
there we’re continually monitoring 
brain activity; that won’t settle into 
the regular rhythms for a few more 
weeks.” 

Art lay back carefully on the 
cart, settling his head down gently 
on the pillow. “Is that a living 
human being?” he asked the 
fluorescent lights above. The vision 
of the grotesque, half fish-like head 
was still before him, and the tiny 
hands, that seemed about to be 
raised secretively, protectively, be- 
fore the face. “Is it?” 

“You tell me,” the doctor grunt- 
ed, moving the cart in the direction 
of the X-ray. Art now noticed the 
thick shielding hung between the 



machine and the artificial womb at 
the end of the laboratory. The 
doctor continued: “Frankly, I’ve 
Had my doubts. Sometimes I feel I 
don’t know where to start in think- 
ing about it anymore.” His tone 
was mild and preoccupied; now he 
had begun a delicate positioning of 
Art’s head beneath the X-ray 
snout. 

Art, still looking at the ceiling, 
said: “Maybe it doesn’t matter if a 
fetus is a human being or not. 
Maybe such a question is meaning- 
less.” 

“Take a deep breath — hold it, 
don’t move.” There came the usual 
audible hum. “All right, you can 
move. What do you mean, it 
doesn’t matter? You know, if these 
embryos and fetuses turn out not to 
be individual human beings after 
all, then I and some of my friends 
have gone to a hell of a lot of 
trouble and broken a hell of a lot of 
laws for nothing.” 

Art twisted on his cart. “You just 
said that you yourself have 
doubts.” 

“ Doubts , yes!” The man was 
vexed. He waved a piece of black- 
ened film. “I might have very 
strong doubts that there’s a child 
under that overturned box I see in 
the middle of the road, but that 
doesn’t justify my running over it 
with a truck, not without some life- 
or-death reason to run it over. 
Damn, this one didn’t come out as 
clearly as I’d like. Let’s try again. 
Turn on your right side this time, if 
you will.” 

“How about the welfare of 
society as a whole? How about over- 
population, people starving? Aren’t 
those life-or-death reasons?”

“To cut off the life of that little 
girl in there? In a word, no. Take a 
deep breath, hold it. That’s fine.” 
Allowed to move again. Art got 
up on one elbow. “1 suspect neither 
of us is going to be able to change 
the other’s mind on this by argu- 
ing." 

Art said: “All right, 1 know that 
thing in the tank has the potential 
for someday being a full human 
being, with all the rights thereof. 
But not yet, surely not yet. It may 
generate a brain wave or two but it 
can’t think, it may twitch but it 
can’t act. It couldn’t survive for 
three minutes without artificial 
help.” 

“Neither could you if you had a 
really massive coronary. And she 
could have survived quite well in 
her natural environment, had we 
been able to leave her there.” The 
gray-green eyes gave the pictures a 
final stare and then turned to Art 
with evident relief. “You’re all 
right. This second picture makes it 
unanimous. No fracture. You 
ought to take things easy for a 
while, but you can go.” 

“Tell me. Why does that have to 
be a baby? Why must you break the 
laws, as you admit doing, to make 
that point?” 

T he doctor sighed, and let him- 
self down in a chair beside the 
paper-burdened table, as Art sat 
up on the cart and reached for his 
shirt. “Art, I can’t make it a baby 
or not a baby. I can only try to 
determine which category it already 
belongs to, and conduct myself ac- 
cordingly.” He wearily rubbed his 
eyes. “Damn it, it looks like a baby 
now, right? In a few weeks it may 



begin to suck its thumb. A cute 
little human touch, hey? Not neces- 
sarily convincing.” 

“Wait a minute. How about gill- 
slits? Doesn’t it still have those, or 
didn’t it at an earlier stage? Are 
they cute little proofs of humanity 
too?" 

“All right, the gill slits. What do 
you think they prove?” 

“I . nothing. How am I sup- 
posed to know? You’re the scien- 
tist, or at least the expert, though 
most of the scientists and experts 
don’t seem to agree with you on 
this. What has you so convinced?” 

“Art, 1 know of no solid scientific 
definition of man. What can I com- 
municate to you? Only facts, and 
people interpret them in different 
ways. Both parents of that 
organism in the tank were human, 
of course. But its cells are different 
from either of its parents’ cells; it is 
now a genetically unique individual. 

“It . no, I have to say she. 
What you see as a thing in a tank I 
see as a little girl. But if you try to 
pin me down on when she began to 
be a little girl. I’ll have to admit 
that I just don’t know. Teilhard 
says that the beginnings of all 
Ihings tend to be out of sight. Was 
a unique hulnan soul infused when 
the sperm first pierced the egg? 
When the nuclei of the two parent 
cells were first completely united? 
With implantation of the blastocyst 
in the uterine wall? Maybe a few 
days after that, when the time of 
possible twinning had passed.” 

“If you’re bringing souls into it, 
you’re leaving me out.” Art was off 
the cart now, getting dressed. In 
the background the steady tick- 
tick-tick went on, soft and rapid. 



106 



GALAXY 




“Just let me get out of here.” 

“Of course.” As if caught dere- 
lict in his duty, the doctor jumped 
up and went to push a button near 
the door. “I can’t help bringing 
souls into it, though I tried. I’m a 
Christian priest as well as a doctor, 
you see. I suppose if one’s 
humanity is questioned one must 
try to prove it by appealing either to 
God or to a board of review of other 
human beings, who sit in judg- 
ment. I know which I prefer to do.” 
“No one is questioning your hu- 
manity, doctor.” 

“Not now. But some future gov- 
ernment might decide that I belong 
to an inferior race. Governments in 
the past have made such pro- 
nouncements about people. Or, if I 
suffered a stroke tonight and still 
hadn’t come to by next week, my 
fellow physicians might by then be 
questioning my continued hu- 
manity.” He rose from his chair, 
hands clenching. The naturally 
fierce look in his eyes grew more in- 
tense. “Maybe it would be the 
kindest thing in such a case to let 
me die. But I would still be a 
human being dying, not a — a speci- 
men reacting!” 

“All right,” said Art, in slight 
alarm, speeding up the fastening of 
his shorts. “Take it^asy.” 

“Yes, I’m sorry.” The tall man 
let himself slump back into his 
chair. “In my opinion there are a 
few rare situations where abortion 
may be justified, at least if there’s 
not an artificial womb available. 
But it’s still a human being dying, 
being killed, and there’s not many 
reasons to justify that. Surely not 
some non-specific good intended 
for the world in general.” 



Art, dressed now and putting on 
his watch, shook his head. “Do you 
think a single human being dying 
matters that much to the universe? 
Appeal to your God if you want, the 
rest of us haven’t heard anything 
from him lately. We have to look 
out for ourselves as best we can.” 
The priest-doctor pulled himself 
to his feet once more. “Let me go 
and find someone to drive you 
home. We’ll feed you something 
first if you care to wait for it.” 
“No, I’m not quite through talk- 
ing yet.” Art moved to stand be- 
tween the other and the door. “You 
are about to inflict a third child on 
me and my wife, because your God 
wants you to. The least you can do 
is listen to me for a minute longer.” 
Abruptly the priest turned fierce 
again. “I am sincerely sorry for the 
danger and expense and incon- 
venience that the third child is 
going to cause you. But it is still 
better than inflicting death on your 
third child. If you find his presence 
unendurable, why there are people 
in the world who will take him in.” 
“People in the world! Yes, I’ll 
say there are.” Now they were 
standing almost toe to toe, Art with 
his arms folded like an umpire. 
“About eight or nine billion at last 
count. And how many of them are 
starving now?” 

“Quite a few are starving, Art, 
quite a few. Maybe you’ve seen 
more of them than I have. Maybe 
you’ve fed more of them. Maybe 
you promote contraception more 
enthusiastically than I do.” 



B ut Art seemed to have stopped 
listening. He stood staring, with 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



107 




an altered expression, into a corner 
of the room. The priest looked 
there and saw only a red picnic 
cooler with a white handle. 

“Art, here, sit down again. I’m 
sorry, we shouldn’t have been 
arguing." 

“No, I’m all right,” said Art. But 
then he did sit down in the chair the 
other brought for him. “That 
cooler over there. I believe I may 
have carried that across the Missis- 
sippi a few days ago. It was very 
heavy and very cold. Now I’m just 
realizing what must have been in- 
side it. That was while your monas- 
tery out there was burning down.” 

“You were there?" The priest sat 
down again too, and leaned 
anxiously toward him. “Can you 
tell me anything of what happened? 
I’ve seen and read the news stories, 
but . 

Art told what he could, leaving 
out the name of the girl for whom 
he had carried the container. “And 
the man with her said, ‘That was 
Steve’ before he took off running 
into the woods. That’s about all I 
can tell you.” 

The priest-doctor nodded, hands 
clamped on his knees, squinting as 
if in physical pain. “Yes. Those two 
men were both my friends. Neither 
of them mentioned in the official 
accounts. Maybe the police never 
knew they were there.” 

“I’m really sorry,” Art said im- 
pulsively. “At the time there didn’t 
seem to be anything 1 could do.” 

“Of course not, Art. It’s not your 
fault. Listen, I’d better get you on 
your way home before I’m charged 
with kidnapping. But you must be 
hungry, let us feed you something 
first." 



“Maybe just a protein bar. I 
never got around to thanking you 
for this patch-up job, did I?” Art 
brushed a hand gingerly over his 
scalp bandage. It wasn’t nearly as 
big as he had expected, and very 
little of his hair had been removed. 

In a few minutes one of the stal- 
wart Young Virgins brought him a 
couple of bars on a plate, and a 
glass of milk. As he munched, the 
priest-doctor asked him: “Would 
you object very strongly to a blind- 
fold when you leave? I’d accept 
your word if you gave it, but some 
of the other people here might 
not.” 

“Blindfold? Oh, I don’t care.” 
Art was abstracted again. Foodbar 
in hand, he got up suddenly and 
went to push the white screen aside. 

Like an idol in a temple, he 
thought suddenly. Surrounded by 
its screens and paraphernalia like 
an idol, or a statue on an altar. 
Suddenly the minuscule statue 
frowmed at him, averted its blind 
face, then stretched an arm. 

Not an idol, then. Far more than 
that. Inscrutable as a flower or a 
nebula, it could only be contem- 
plated, not understood. Tick-tick- 
tick. And again the firing neurons 
in its developing brain smeared 
green traces across the three os- 
cilloscopes. 



S haking hands with the doctor 
an his w>ay out, Art said: 
“Thanks again for the treatment. 
You know' if I could find a way I’d 
still stop Rita from going through 
with this. Because of the kind of 
world we have to live in. But I wish 
it wasn't so, I wish the world would

let your way be possible. Anyway, 
you tell her that I want her back, 
whatever happens. I want that 
most.” 

“I'll tell her, Art. I'll be very glad 
to pass that word along.” 

XI 

at one o’clock in the afternoon 
Art, once more shrouded in an 
opaque cover (this one smelling 
more medicinal than musty), was 
led out of the laboratory and out of 
doors, across an area of long weedy 
grass and uneven paving stones. 
Then he was put into the back seat 
of a car, where without being told 
he hunkered down so as to be in- 
visible from the outside. The car 
when started jolted slowly over 
rough terrain for about a minute, 
before getting onto any kind of a 
regular road. Shortly Art began to 
hear the noises of other traffic 
around him. 

“You can come up,” said one of 
his Young Virgin escorts, in apolo- 
getic tones, only about five minutes 
after the start of the trip and some- 
what before Art had expected any 
such permission. He pulled the 
blanket gingerly from his sore head 
and eased himself up to a normal 
position in the seat. The car was 
traveling through some middle- 
class, jobholders’ residential neigh- 
borhood that Art could not recog- 
nize. One of the two youths escort- 
ing him sat beside him in the back. 

“Sorry, we’re not going to be 
able to take you all the way to the 
Parrs' house,” the driver said, 
apologetically. “It’s possible their 
place is being watched — you know 
how it is." 



"1 don’t know whether I do or 
not. Not any more." 

"Pardon?” 

“It’s all right. I can walk.” 

“Oh, oh,” said his other escort, 
swiveling his head to peer back 
through the rear window. As it 
turned out. Art didn’t have far to 
walk at all. The police car with its 
blue lights flashing came alongside 
and nudged their vehicle neatly to 
the curb with its foamy plastic 
bumpers. 

F rom the questions the police 
asked before the van arrived to 
cart the three of them off to the sta- 
tion, Art gathered that his escorts’ 
car had been somehow identified as 
one used by participants in the 
morning’s infamous Family Plan- 
ning riot. All its present occupants 
were under grave suspicion, the 
sullen one with the lump on his 
head being no exception. When 
they unloaded at the lockup he was 
taken underground to a large cell 
w ith padded w alls. He recognized it 
as what they called a DD, or drunk- 
drug, tank on the tv crime dramas. 
In real life he found it crowded not 
with thrashing drunks or drug- 
gards, but w’ith loudly vocal Young 
Virgin types, several of whom com- 
plained steadily to the walls (where 
perhaps there were microphones to 
listen) of their real or supposed in- 
juries. 

Nobody else was listening. 
"Shuddup in there,” advised a 
loudspeaker in the ceiling, from 
time to time. In reply to this the 
Young Virgins would usually break 
out into a verse of all but unintelli- 
gible song. Approaching Art 
through this milieu, smiling as if at 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



109 




an old friend, came a suddenly 
familiar face: that of the sign- 
peddler of the morning. 

“It’s just a mistake I was picked 
up.” Art could hear the sign- 
peddler saying, as the latest out- 
burst of song was ended. “My signs 
were useful, weren’t they, to let the 
world know what was going on? A 
man tries to be an influence for 
peace and communication in the 
world, to mediate the intelligent ex- 
pression of differences in the com- 
munity, and this is the thanks he 
gets. Hey, bud, which side were you 
on?” 

“Shut up,” said Art Rodney. 

Now another fifteen or twenty 
prisoners were being brought in a 
group, adding to the crowding and 
confusion. These looked like 
Young Virgins too. Presumably any 
Homo League members arrested 
were being held somewhere else, in 
the interest of relative peace. The 
corridors under this station seemed 
to be lined with these tank-like 
cells, and through the corridors 
drifted the steady animal murmur- 
ing of innumerable inmates. There 
was also a noticeable amount of 
dust in the air, and the muffled 
roar of heavy machinery at work 
nearby. Maybe more cell space was 
being excavated. 

At last three policemen came to 
the door of Art’s cell, and set up a 
table there for processing. “One at 
a time now, people. Form a single 
line. Come up here and present 
your identification and we’ll take 
your fingerprints. Then you can 
make one phone call. Form a single 
line." 

' A Young Virgin girl, a beautiful 
girl with dark devilish eyes, pushed 



herself forward to the table and de- 
manded: “How about separate 

facilities for men and women?” 

The policemen who had already 
spoken eyed her warily, his lined 
face on guard against any of these 
young punks attempting to get 
smart. “Separate what?" 

“Latrines!” The girl waved at the 
open urinals and water closet at the 
rear wall of the cell. “We want to 
have separate latrines for each sex, 
with walls closing them off.” 

The cop’s hardened face showed 
disgust. "Oh, arid no doubt you’d 
like to open a brothel in here, too. 
You’ll take what the city gives you, 
and do your carryin’ on outside of 
jail.” 

As if that were the answer she 
had hoped for, the girl stepped 
back smiling. With a gesture and a 
yell she started up another loud 
song, all the Young Virgins within 
earshot quickly joining in. But their 
rebelliousness now seemed strictly 
verbal; they were not slow to line up 
before the table for processing. Jail 
probably grew quite boring in a 
couple of hours, and it was now 
time to call one’s parents to get one 
out. Art used his weight and his 
elbows in self-defense, refusing to 
be pushed to the rear. 

Someone shouted at him: “Do 
you know the song?” It was a com- 
radely voice, coming from just be- 
hind Art in the newly formed 
queue. The speaker was a tall 
young man, wearing a sweatshirt 

with STUDENTS FOR A CHASTE 

society handpainted on the front; 
something about him looked 
vaguely familiar to Art. 

“No, why should I know your 
song?” Art answered, as soon as

the noise of it had trailed off into 
silence and he could talk without 
shouting. “1 was just caught up in 
all this by mistake.” 

“That’s the way it was with me,” 
said the voice of the sign-peddler, 
from up near the head of the line. 

"Are you with us, though?” 
asked the devil-eyed girl ahead of 
Art. As the line was just about 
formed she had squeezed her cloth- 
shrouded body in just ahead of 
him, her eyes daring him to protest. 

“I’m not with you or against you. 
I just happened to get caught up in 
this.” 

The girl’s eyes, those of a deter- 
mined persecutor, attacked Art’s 
beard and the conservative translu- 
cency of his clothing. She was 
silent, perhaps making plans. 

The tall young man demanded: 
“Sir, if you’re really not with us, 
why not?” His tone was meant to be 
not threatening but inspiring. 
“Now I judge you’re a man who has 
supported the Establishment in the 
past, who has upheld all its out- 
worn dogmas and twentieth-century 
creeds. And now it’s thrown you 
into jail anyway. What good has 
worshipping the sex gods and 
goddesses ever done you? Think 
about it.” 

“Oh, shut up,” said Art, and 
shuffled forward with the line. If it 
came to posting bond, he didn’t 
have a great deal of money. 

He never knew what Rita was 
feeling — those had been her words 
to him. Why couldn’t he have 
started, sooner, to find out? Until 
he knew what she was feeling it 
made little sense to argue with her. 
Of course she should have shown 
him similar consideration, talked 



to him more, found out what he 
really felt. Maybe they weren’t so 
utterly, terribly far apart as it had 
seemed when she ran away. He 
didn’t want her having another 
baby, of course . but if she was 
going to, anyway, if she really had 
to do it, then he wanted to be with 
her while it was going on. Now it 
was too late even for that. He 
wouldn’t be able to reach her until 
the thing was done. 

“Everybody be careful!” cried 
the devil-eyed girl brightly. She had 
been whispering with a couple of 
girl friends, and now she was ready 
to have some more fun with Art. 
“Everybody on their proper be- 
havior while Mr. Whiskers is here. 
Maybe we should all undress a 
little.” 

“Now, Eunice,” chided the tall 
young man. She wasn’t helping his 
recruiting drive at all. 

At least Art was soon going to 
have a chance at a phoneplate. Did 
he have the nerve to call George 
and Ann, tell them that he had 
been caught in a riot in front of the 
Family Planning building, and ask 
them for help? Not if he could help 
it. Better if he never saw them 
again until this whole thing was 
over — but of course, his children 
were there. He had no choice but to 
call the Parrs. 

“I do hope they let us out soon,” 
said Eunice. “I want to pack as 
much sin into my life as I possibly 
can!” She stepped defiantly up to 
face the sour policeman at the cell 
door. Art followed in his turn. 

after being fingerprinted and 
filling out a short routine 
identity form, Art got his chance at 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



111 




the phoneplate. Behind him other 
prisoners were waiting. Reluctantly 
he punched the Parrs’ number, and 
felt more relief than anything else 
when he was answered only by 
George’s recorded voice telling him 
that he might leave a message if he 
wished. He left no message and 
after a moment’s thought his relief 
turned sour. Maybe the Parrs had 
been arrested too, and his children 
were now in some orphanage. 

He was allowed one completed 
call. Who else in the city did he 
know, where else might he turn for 
help? There was the dojo, but he 
couldn’t remember either its name 
or address. There was Dr. 
Hammad. Ugh. After thinking a 
moment longer he dug a piece of 
folded paper from his wallet and, 
without much hope, punched 
numbers on the phoneplate once 
again. 

“Jamison residence,” said a male 
voice, answering through a blanked 
plate on the other end. 

He cleared hsi throat. “I’d like to 
speak to Rosamond Jamison, 
please.” 

“Who shall I say is calling?” The 
voice had some thick and awkward 
tones in it, those of a man who 
would rather be doing something 
more manly than taking messages 
on the phone. 

“Tell her it’s Art Rodney. Tell 
her the man she met on the tube 
train from California. She’ll 
remember.” 

“The tube train. All right, wait 
just a moment.” 

Art waited, gazing around him. 
The prisoners in line to use the 
phone looked in their frozen impa- 
tience as if they expected him to 



forget about his call and get out of 
their way at once. And now the 
nearby police were all watching 
Art, silently, with peculiarly blank, 
controlled faces. He hadn’t noticed 
them doing this when other 
prisoners were phoning. If it was 
just a game they were playing to 
make him nervous they were suc- 
ceeding. 

“Hello?” It was Rosamond’s 
voice. Then on the phoneplate ap- 
peared the image of her pretty face, 
the cat’s-eye lenses gleaming. “It is 
you, my handsome protector! I’m 
so glad! I’ve been hoping you would 
call, and Daddy has too, he’s 
wanted to thank you.” 

With the corner of his eye Art 
noted, without understanding, that 
the nearby policemen had suddenly 
all lost interest, were turning away 
and getting back to their jobs. “I’m 
glad I could reach you,” he said. 
“I’m afraid I need help, and I don’t 
know where else to turn. The police 
have made a mistake, and they 
have me in jail here—” 

“Wha-at?” 

“I innocently accepted a ride 
with some strangers,” which was 
quite true, “and it turned out the 
police w ere looking for their car. So 
now' I’m being detained for ques- 
tioning, as they put it. I’m held for 
investigation on a charge of 
conspiracy to riot, something like 
that. I’m not sure I have it straight. 

I was hoping you might be willing 
to call a law'yer for me. Or some- 
thing. I’m afraid I don’t have much 
money w ith me, and — ” 

“Oh my, oh my. Poor Art. How 
do you spell your last name? And 
what station are they holding you 
at?”

He spelled his name for her. 
“And the sign here says Tenth Dis- 
trict Detention.” 

“Just wait there, wait!” Rose 
counseled him excitedly. Then she 
blanked off. 

Art took a step away from the 
phone and a policeman was there to 
touch him on the arm and beckon 
him away. This officer, for a 
change, had a friendly-seeming 
smile. He led Art down a corridor 
to where a bulky, middle-aged man 
in civilian clothes was sitting 
behind a desk. On the desk were 
computer printouts whereon ap- 
peared small photographs of Art, 
both full face and profile. The ban- 
dage on his head with the small 
bald spot around it showed on the 
photos, and he wondered when and 
how they had been made. 

The bulky man looked up. 
“You’re Mr. Arthur Rodney? 1 see 
here that you’re from out of state. 
Did you know when you accepted a 
ride in that car that the police were 
looking for it?” 

“No, I — 'no.” 

“Well, we find that there’s no 
evidence to the contrary. We’re 
very sorry about the inconvenience, 
but you can understand that we 
can't take any chances.” 

“I suppose not.” 

The man behind the desk 
nodded in a friendly way, and the 
interview seemed to be over. An- 
other smiling policeman, this one 
in uniform and with an unusually 
large number of stripes on his 
sleeve, was holding open a door at 
one side of the desk as if he ex- 
pected Art to pass through it. 
Beyond the door was an ascending 
escalator. 



After he had started up, and 
realized that what appeared to be a 
public lobby was at the top, Art 
asked: “This means that I’m free to 
go?" 

“That’s right, sir.” The smiling 
sergeant had come with him onto 
the rising stair. “By the way,” he 
added, his voice lowering, “if 
you’re talking to — anybody, you 
can let’em know that the men on 
the force are a hundred per cent be- 
hind the campaign to get tough 
with the apes and get’em off the 
streets.” 

“Huh?” 

They had reached the marbled 
public lobby on the station’s 
ground floor. With a gesture the 
smiling sergeant directed Art’s 
attention to where the air-curtained 
main doorway stood open to the 
world. 

“I’d better wait here for a 
while,” said Art. “I think some- 
one’s coming to see about getting 
me out.” 

“That so?” The sergeant 
winked. “Tell’em they needn’t have 
bothered. Still, you’re welcome to 
wait for’em here if you like. Have a 
seat. Excuse me, I’d better get back 
to work.” 

“Certainly.” As soon as the man 
had gone. Art went to a public 
phone booth in the lobby and tried 
the Parrs’ again. To his surprise, 
Ann answered the phone almost at 
once. 

“Art, what’s up?” 

He stood with his head held high; 
maybe the bandage wouldn’t be 
noticeable at that angle to the 
plate’s pickups, with his hair sort of 
piled in front of it. “How are the 
kids?”

“Why, they’re fine, fine. How 
are things with you?” 

“I tried to get you a few minutes 
ago, but no one answered.” 

“I was just out in the park with 
the children. George is working. 
Where are you calling from. Art?” 
“I’ll — be talking to you again, 
soon, Ann." With that he blanked 
off. 

TjfH went to sit in the marbled 
Ij lobby, and watched the public 
flow in and out at a brisk rate. All 
these people were involved with 
legal trouble in some way, even if 
they w'ere only reporting it, so he 
supposed it was natural that they 
should look frightened or dazed, or 
indignant or stony-faced. What 
bothered Art was that now when he 
looked out the window at the 
throng passing the station on the 
slidew'alk, the faces out there 
looked much the same. 

He had been sitting there less 
than ten minutes when Rose came 
in. She spotted him at once, 
smiled, and came marching clack- 
clack across the lobby on new hard- 
heeled sandals. It struck him now 
that her walk was somewhat too 
childlike and bouncy for a normally 
mature young woman. She was 
wearing a red bikni, daringly 
opaque all over and almost pad less. 
Art stood up and greeted her with 
an embrace. 

“My good friend Art! How have 
they treated you?” 

“Fine, ever since they heard me 
talking to you on the phone. Before 
that they practically had me sen- 
tenced, and now they tell me I’m 
free to go.” 

Rose laughed prettily, and linked 



her arm in his. “Then let’s be 
going. We have lots to talk about 
on our way.” 

He w alked out of the station with 
her, asking: “Did you call a 
lawyer?” 

“I thought you couldn’t be in any 
serious trouble,” she said oblique- 
ly. “Here, get in.” She was unlock- 
ing the door of a very expensive car 
parked right in the no standing 
zone in front of the police station. 
The Illinois license plate was num- 
ber four. Four. Great sex, had his 
luck changed at last? 

He got in obediently. “Where are 
we going?” 

“I want to take you home with 
me, Artie. I told you. Daddy’s been 
anxious to meet you.” 

Once in on the driver’s side. Rose 
scanned the readiness indicators on 
the dash, as a cautious driver 
should, and then punched keys 
quickly. Then she sat back and 
turned to Art, giving him a long, 
unfathomable look while the pro- 
grammed car started its engine and 
radared its way out into traffic. 

“Artie?” 

“What is it — Rosie? Do you like 
being called Rosie, by the way?” 

“Yes, I do like it.” She tilted her 
head, making the lenses shimmer 
beautifully. Probably in days of 
calm she practiced with them be- 
fore a mirror. “Artie, my father’s a 
very nice man, a kind man. He’s 
not one to fly into rages or anything 
like that." 

“Well. That’s fine." He sup- 
posed she w'anted him to ask some 
favor of her father for her. “Just 
w ho is your father, by the way?” 

“He’s the bishop, silly. Church 
of Eros archbishop of Chicago. 



114 



GALAXY 




Everybody in Chicago knows him. 
Artie, we really are good friends, 
aren’t we?” Taking Art’s hand. 
Rose swung his arm back and forth 
over the seat between them. It was 
a childlike action, and when a basi- 
cally sexy girl like Rose did it, a 
man could be tempted toward 
serious repression. Especially a 
weary man drained of his energy to 
light. The vision of her crouching 
on the riverbank, veiled by his dirty 
shirt, rose in his mind’s eye but he 
managed to thrust it down. 

“Of course we’re good friends, 
Rose. Any time 1 can do you a favor 
I hope you’ll let me know.” 

“Today 1 just want you to meet 
Daddy." She giggled. 

“I’m looking forward to that, 
[’specially . Rose, I won’t lie to 
you. Especially now that 1 know 
he's someone with influence.” An 
hour ago Art had been ready to 
resign the game, but now things 
might be just a little different. “Be- 
cause you see I have a problem, one 
that I really need help with. I hope 
your father may be able to at least 
give me some advice on it.” 

The cat’s-eyes seemed to offer 
sympathy. “It isn’t a really big and 
nasty problem, is it? Oh, I hope 
not." 

He laughed feebly. “Big and 
nasty enough. Oh, 1 haven't 
murdered anyone, so far." 

Rose snatched her hand away. 
“Don’t say things like that! Don’t 
even make jokes about them!” 

“I’m sorry." He hadn’t realized 
how sensitive she was to even the 
suggestion of violence. He looked 
around them. “Do you live near- 
by?” 

“Not far." The neighborhood 



through which they were now 
passing looked much like that 
around the Parrs’ home, except 
here the blockhouses were set even 
further from the street, occupied 
larger plots of land, and their walls 
looked even higher. Just ahead was 
one whose granite walls were extra 
high. 

“We’re almost home, my big 
handsome protector.” 

The car measured the traffic and 
the traffic-spaces around it, chose 
an opening and shifted precisely to 
the street’s curb lane, then sig- 
nalled for a turn and dove onto a 
ramp that swept it down beneath 
the granite walls. A man in a 
guard’s booth gave Rose a casual 
wave which she returned while 
switching the slowing vehicle back 
to manual control. The steering 
gear folded out of a panel into her 
hands and she drove on. 

Here as in the Parrs’ block the 
underground garage was divided 
into visitors' parking areas and pri- 
vate stalls. Rose turned into what 
appeared to be the largest stall, 
with two cars parked in it already, 
and room for several more. 

She switched off the turbines and 
turned to Art again. “Artie, if your 
problem is — nothing like the 

horrible thing you joked about — 
then you can tell me what it is. In 
fact I think you’d better tell me, 
before you go in and meet Daddy.” 

"Rose, it has nothing to do with 
violence. It’s somewhat similar to — 
your problem. To the problem you 
were faced with when you and I 
first met.” 

She had pretty teeth and moist, 
full lips. “FJowever did you figure 
out what that was?” 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



115 




"Oh, just putting two and two to- 
gether. I know now what you must 
have had in that picnic cooler.” 
Now her lips were pouting. Was 
she going to cry? It seemed to Art 
that without eyes her weeping 
would be tearless and therefore re- 
pulsive. “Not that I care what you 
were doing. Rose, not that I’m in 
any position to talk. It’s just that 
my wife is now having difficulties 
along a somewhat similar line. I 
don’t know that your father would 
be able to help me with that kind of 
a problem, or that he’d want to get 
involved in it.” 

Rose dabbed with a tissue at her 
nose, and yes, at her lidless lenses 
too. “I’m glad you understand, 
Art. What happened to my fetus is 
another thing my father mustn’t 
know the truth about.” ( Another 
thing?) “Of course he thinks that I 
simply had it aborted. But 1 can’t 
even think about such violence, let 
alone permit it inside my own body. 
Ugh.*' A final dab and a deep 
breath, and she smiled and was 
back to what passed for normal. 
“Now you’d better listen to me for a 
minute, Artie. Because I haven’t 
told you everything yet.” 

S omething about those words 
was ominous. Art leaned back 
in the car’s luxurious seat, closing 
his eyes for just a moment’s rest. 
He checked his watch. A little past 
three. Then he turned and looked 
into Rose's lenses. “What is it you 
haven’t told me?” 

Once more she took his arm. She 
became clinging. “Oh, Artie, I was 
just desperate. You see, there’s a 
man I . like. I like him very 
much indeed. In fact I’ve come to — 



to revere him.” 

“Revere!” 

“Art, I put my fate into your 
hands. I know you won’t betray me. 
Just recently my father has found 
out that I’m having an affair, or at 
least he’s become very suspicious. 
But he doesn't know who the man 
is, and I didn’t dare confess the 
truth, because . anyway, I 
didn’t dare. So today I told him 
that it was you.” 

“Oh.” Art closed his eyes again. 
He supposed he could push Rose 
out of the car, seize the controls, 
and go roaring up out of the 
garage, perhaps crashing through 
the barrier at the door. Transport- 
ing illegally frozen fetuses. Rioting. 
Midwifery. Auto theft, gate-crash- 
ing. Was there a crime called gate- 
crashing? There would be. No pre- 
vious convictions, or even arrests, 
that Rodney must have been a 
clever one. But sooner or later the 
most cunning criminals trip them- 
selves up. They say he seduced a 
bishop’s daughter, that’s what 
really wrote finis to his career. They 
say just the other day he was in the 
Family Planning office, bold as you 
please, talking about an appoint- 
ment with the director himself. 
They say . 

“Artie, dear?” Rose’s voice 
dripped honeyed anxiety. Probably 
she didn’t even like to be called 
Rosie. “Artie? I was just desperate, 
or I would never have done it. I had 
no one else to turn to, and I just 
had to keep Daddy from finding 
out who my true cavalier really 
is . Art? Oh, I promise it won’t 
be so bad. Daddy really did want to 
get you out of jail, even after I told 
him you were the one.”

Art nodded slowly, meanwhile 
keeping his eyelids firmly closed. If 
he could somehow get out of the 
bishop’s dungeon here and reach 
the Parrs’ castle, maybe Ann could 
hide him under a bed and no one 
would ever find him. Drape him in 
an opaque sheet. But that might 
constitute another crime. Oh, chas- 
tity, what a mess. Maybe he was 
dreaming. 

“I was just in despair. Art, when 
suddenly you called. Then it 
seemed so logical for you to be the 
man that I told Daddy you were. 
Don’t you see? Art, are you all 
right? Poor Art!” 

Poor Art opened his eyes. Now 
then, what did he have to do to 
attain success and happiness? Meet 
the bishop and prove himself inno- 
cent of Rose’s seduction. Then, 
with or without ecclesiastical help, 
find Rita and get her safely 
aborted, w'hile keeping George and 
Ann, and Rita and himself of 
course, clear of the law. That about 
covered it. 

He opened the car door and slid 
out. The situation was clearly 
beyond worrying about, and from 
that fact he derived a kind of 
second wind. Bring on the bishop. 

“Shall we go in, Artie?” 

“Oh, why not?" 

Rose led him directly from the 
parking stall through a double door 
that might have served to guard a 
bank vault, and up a private esca- 
lator. The door at the top was 
opened by a huge man, rough-look- 
ing though well dressed, who eyed 
Art with suspicion. Art in turn 
suffered a momentary fear that this 
was the bishop himself. 

Rose said: “Jove, this is a friend 



of mine, Mr. Rodney. Daddy 
wanted me to bring him home so 
they could get acquainted.” 

Jove grunted. “Have’im wait 
here and I’ll see. Or would you 
rather go in. Miss Jamison?” 

“No, you go, I’ll wait with Art.” 
She took Art’s arm and they stood 
there in the elegantly carpeted hall 
like a couple waiting to be married. 

“The bishop’s chiefbodyguard?” 
Art asked, when the giant was 
gone. 

“Yes. Don’t mind Jove’s rough 
manners, he’s really quite sweet.” 
She squeezed his arm meaning- 
fully. “So’s Daddy. Now 1 put all 
my trust in you, darling.” 

Jove was already coming back 
through the plush hallway. “The 
boss says you should bring him on 
in. Hey, Miss Jamison, you’re look- 
ing real hot. I’m off duty in a little 
while, could we maybe get together 
for some sex?” 

“All right, Jove, I’ll see you in 
the chapel. Art, dear, let me intro- 
duce you to Daddy first.” 

At the end of the hall Rose 
tapped on an old-fashioned wood- 
paneled door, then pushed it open 
without waiting for an answer. The^ 
room revealed was a large study, 
the w'alls lined with bookshelves 
and tape-racks. A massive, brown- 
skinned old man rose from an arm- 
chair and favored Art with a mild 
smile of greeting. The bishop wore 
the exaggerated white codpiece of 
his office, under a vaguely trans- 
parent robe. 

“Daddy, this is Art. I’ve been 
telling him how nice you are, and 
that he really had nothing to be 
afraid of, meeting you. Now I want 
you to be nice to him.” 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



117 




“Why, I’m generally sociable, 
dear.” The old man accepted his 
daughter’s kiss on his worn sagging 
cheek. “Dear, why don’t you buzz 
away now for a little bit? Mr. Rod- 
ney and I are going to have a chat.” 

“Sure, Daddy. I expect I’ll be in 
the chapel with Jove if you should 
want me.” Turning toward Art 
with an expression that was doubt- 
less meant to be encouraging, Rose 
stepped past him and out of the 
study. Art, who had reached out his 
arm mechanically, caught himself 
at the last moment and let her go 
without a good-bye pinch. They 
were supposed to be having an 
affair, and possibly, just possibly, 
he would want to maintain that 
fiction. 

Bishop Jamison was still smiling. 
“Mr. Rodney, that sofa there is 
very comfortable. And how about a 
drink? I have vodka and bourbon 
and beer and even a little sherry on 
hand.” 

“Uh, thank you sir. Your 
Potency. Bourbon on the rocks 
would be fine.” Art sank resignedly 
into the sofa while his host turned 
away. Poison in the whisky, 
maybe? He would drink it anyway. 

T he room might have been the 
study of any successful and con- 
servative man, though, not surpris- 
ingly, there was a somewhat heavy 
emphasis on religious art. Rodin’s 
The Kiss in nearly lifesize repro- 
duction. Leda and the Swan, there 
on the wall, by one of the newer 
photographic masters. Painting 
had been dead for a century now, 
along with poetry and story-telling, 
or so most of the critics said. And 
there of course above the mantel, 



Love Conquers All, Caravaggio’s 
Cupid trampling triumphantly the 
symbols of the occupations by 
which man sometimes allowed 
himself to be lured temporarily 
away from his true master. Lust. 

The old man was back, holding 
out a glass, and Art half rose to 
take it from him. “Thank you, sir.” 

With a wheeze, the bishop 
settled his bulk in his own leather 
chair; his own drink he held in a 
tankard around the outer surface of 
which some kind of Oriental orgy 
marched in bas relief. “Mr. Rod- 
ney. Rose tells me that you and she 
have become quite good friends.” 

“Uh, yes sir, we have.” Art’s in- 
tended sip of bourbon somehow 
transformed itself into a gulp. 

Jamison emerged from his 
tankard w'ith a trace of beer foam 
on his dark lips. “She’s a lovely girl 
in her way . her mother was a 
lovely piece, and I oughta know, 
though I was an old dog even 
then . how was it you two 
happened to meet? On the tube 
train coming in from Iowa, wasn’t 
it?” 

“That’s right, sir.” Art drew in a 
deep breath. “Bishop, I don’t mean 
you or Rose any harm. Far from it. 
So I’m just going to tell you the 
truth. I don’t know what Rose may 
have told you, but the fact of the 
matter is I hardly know her. If she 
has any, ah, involvement with any 
man, it’s certainly not with me.” 
So far the news was being received 
with apparent calm. “I’m sorry 
about her problems. Your Potency, 
and yours, but I have problems of 
my own that are just as bad. I’m 
sorry.” 

Jamison leaned forward a little.

“Would you like a refill on that 
drink?” 

‘Til get it myself, sir, thanks. 
Another beer? I’m telling you the 
truth, bishop, I never was any good 
at lying.” 

The bishop indicated with a 
headshake that his tankard had no 
need of refilling as yet. He swiveled 
his chair to keep facing Art, who 
was now at the bar. “Some people 
never realize they’re not, and it gets 
’em into endless trouble. Most of 
the time honesty simplifies things, 
if it doesn’t always pay. You really 
did help Rose, out there in Iowa, 
didn’t you? Her own story is a little 
muddled. She was just coming 
back from visiting some girl friend 
in Dubuque, I guess, when that riot 
broke out.” 

“Oh, yes sir, I had the chance to 
be of help to her in a small way.” 
Back at the sofa. Art sank down 
with relief and took a sip, this time 
truly no more than a tiny sip, of the 
excellent bourbon. “But believe 
me, there’s been nothing wrong be- 
tween us. We made it all the way, 
right there in the park, while we 
were waiting to get on the train to 
Chicago. ” 

Jamison was nodding slowly. 
“Arthur, I find myself believing 
you. I know my own daughter, and 
she just gave me your name too 
suddenly and too willingly. I don’t 
suppose you know the name of the 
man she is involved with, as you put 
it?” Then before Art could try to 
answer, the bishop scowled and 
waved a white-palmed, wrinkled 
hand. “No, I withdraw the ques- 
tion. Don’t want to put an honest 
man like yourself on the spot.” 

“I really haven’t the faintest 



idea, anyway, who it could be.” 
Numbly relaxing. Art sipped at his 
icy whisky. His head ached, but not 
as bad as before. It seemed that he 
had managed to avert any new and 
disastrous trouble; and what more 
could a man hope for than that? 

The bishop set his tankard down 
carefully on a small table. “Not 
that I care an awful lot what kind of 
fun she has with men.” His steady 
black eyes peered at Art from their 
time-ravaged face. “Probably that 
shocks you, coming from a church- 
man like me. But if she wants to sit 
with some young fella and gaze at 
the stars and forget all about sex 
for ten minutes, I can’t see how 
society is harmed.” 

“Yes sir, I am surprised to hear 
you talk like that.” It would really 
have shocked Art, too, if he hadn’t 
been somewhat numb with alcohol, 
and emotionally exhausted by still 
more shocking things. “If what 
your statement implies is true, that 
society isn’t harmed by repression, 
that it doesn’t matter what people 
do with sex, why do we have the 
Church of Eros then?” 

The bishop heaved himself erect, 
his erotically-decorated tankard in 
hand, and walked over to the dark 
fireplace. It looked a lot like 
George’s, except this one was 
bigger. When the bishop switched 
it on, a realistic imitation of 
burning logs, probably a hologram, 
appeared in the dark cave. The logs 
crackled audibly and flared and 
seemed to send smoke up the flue. 

“This thing is a fake,” Jamison 
mused, patting the mantle with one 
hand. “Lots of fire and noise, but 
no smell. And no real heat.” He set 
his tankard on the mantlepiece and

turned to Art. “You know why it is 
good for man to worship sex? Why 
it really is good? Simply because 
the poor fool has nothing better be- 
fore which to prostrate himself. 
Eros as a god is far from perfect, 
he’s just the best of a bunch of 
failures.” 

Having a little time to think over 
what the bishop said, and looking 
at the old man closely, Art was not 
so very surprised after all. There 
were such cynical bishops in 
modern fiction sometimes. And 
Jamison wasn’t just old, he must be 
decades over a hundred. He must 
have spent his youth in the period 
of moral vacuum before his Church 
became established. Art had 
sometimes heard other very old 
people express similar startlingly 
modern and radical views. 

Standing massive beside the fire- 
place, Jamison told him: “The war- 
god and the wealth-god and the 
heaven-and-love god all have 
failed. Heaven-and-love came the 
closest. Best example is the man 
they nailed up on the cross. He 
spoke to a lot of people, that one 
did. He was about the best, except 
for sex. And then Allah and 
Jehovah and Mithra and all the 
rest. 

“And then there’s the man-god. 
You know what I mean by that? I 
mean god made by man in man’s 
own image, humanity in apotheo- 
sis, we will all be god someday and 
maybe our great leader is god right 
now — he’s the worst, the most 
dangerous, and we’re not through 
with him yet. Damnation, are we 
ever through with anything?” Jami- 
son’s voice, which had taken on the 
tones it might employ on Saturday 



nights in the pulpit above the orgy, 
fell back to conversational pitch. 
One other man in Art’s recent 
memory had used such ancient ex- 
pletives. “Mr. Rodney, man was 
made to worship something, and no 
god he finds is worthy of him. 
That’s what the ancients would 
have called a tragedy. Sex does the 
least harm, I would judge; and sex 
is fun. Oh man, yes man, it sure is 
fun.” 

T he bishop smiled at Art wryly, 
and made his way to the bar to 
get a refill on his beer. Then back 
to his leather chair to let down his 
weight, he and the chair wheezing 
together. “The only thing is, if she 
does like some young man in what 
to her is such an extra-special way, 
then I’d like to know his name and 
what he’s like. Rose has had 
enough pain in her young life al- 
ready. She tell you about that ape- 
assault where she lost her eyes?” 
“No sir. I didn’t know that was 
what had happened. It must have 
been terrible.” 

“That it was,” said Jamison 
shortly. “My much-publicized cru- 
sade against the street-apes and the 
dope-peddlers, which you will hear 
a lot about if you stay long in Chi- 
cago, stems in large part from that 
assault on my daughter.” 

“1 believe 1 heard something 
about it from the police. They were 
in favor.” 

“1 myself am not a non-violent 
man," the bishop said. “Not al- 
ways. Eros does not counsel turning 
the other cheek except for a 
caress.” 

Art failed to understand the 
reference.

Jamison sipped at his newly 
foamy beer. “When 1 was a boy, a 
lot of people thought it was having 
brown skin, what was then called 
being black, that made young men 
go out and act like apes. And there 
was a grain of truth in what they 
said, a grain of truth, because 
brown skin could be a real burden 
then. It could make a man feel 
desperate and just lash out.” 

Art grunted something. He was 
growing sleepy and would have to 
be careful that he didn’t doze off, 
what with the drink and the hyp- 
notic fire. 

“Arthur, if you should ever quote 
me as saying what I said about star- 
gazing being not so bad after all, I 
shall of course deny it. Likewise 
with my speculations on compara- 
tive religion. On the other hand, if 
you should want to mention to me 
now your own problems that you 
said were so bad, I can at least 
guarantee secrecy. Maybe I could 
even offer help.” 

Art was abruptly wide awake 
again. “Well, my problem involves 
my wife. And the Bureau of Family 
Planning. It’s a rather serious . .” 

Jamison w'as already shaking his 
head and putting up a hand to stop 
him. “No. Not Family Planning 
trouble. I’m staying clear of that. 
Sorry, no, it wouldn’t do for a man 
in my position to get involved. Too 
bad, my boy, but I can only wish 
you luck.” 

“That’s all right, sir, I under- 
stand. And I wish you luck. And 
Rose. Understand, bishop, I’m not 
having an affair with her, but she’s 
a very attractive girl and I can 
understand how a man might wish 
to do so. I mean that as a compli- 



ment.” 

“Hmf,” laughed Jamison, a 
single laugh, not loud. He was star- 
ing into the glow of his artificial 
fire, and looking into the long scroll 
of his memories he found Art’s 
words amusing. Then he was silent 
for a while, and Art was almost 
dozing again before Jamison asked 
suddenly: “You’re not angry about 
what Rose did to you today?” 

“Telling you I was the man? I al- 
most fell through the floor. She 
didn’t spring it on me until we were 
here and I couldn’t run out. But 
I’m not angry now. She didn’t do it 
out of meanness.” 

“You’re right about that.” Jami- 
son nodded. “There’s no meanness 
in her. But ever since that assault 
she’s been not quite right in her 
mind. Too much frightened of any 
least hint of violence. I think she’s 
scared that I’ll have violence done 
upon the real man, should I dis- 
cover his identity. Now who could 
he be, that she should harbor that 
idea?” 

“I really wish I could help,” said 
Art. “But I guess there’s nothing I 
can do.” 

“She saw psychiatrists right after 
she was injured, and now she’s 
talking about going to another one, 
but I don’t put any faith in ’em. 
Doctors, computers, modern 
science, and we still live in caves 
with the doors blockaded. Not that 
I want to damn modern science, 
not me with my artificial heart and 
arteries.” With a seeming effort 
Jamison roused himself from his 
musings, and once more got to his 
feet. “Go with Eros, my son. Is 
there anything else I might be able 
to do for you?”

Art put down his glass and stood 
up. “I guess not, sir. Thanks again 
for getting me out of jail. I really 
was innocent.” 

When he emerged from the 
study. Rose, who had changed her 
red bikni for a transparent dress, 
jumped up from a sofa in the hall 
and hurried to him eagerly. “What 
happened?” she stage-whispered. 
“Did Daddy believe you?” 

“I think he believed everything I 
told him.” 

She was so delighted she jiggled 
up and down like a child. “And he 
didn’t explode?” 

“No, he didn’t.” 

Rose squealed. “My faithful pro- 
tector! You took such a risk for 
me.” She threw her arms around 
Art and kissed him with a kind of 
innocent chastity. “Poor Daddy, 
sometimes at his age his mind 
wanders. I hate to deceive him. But 
I knew you’d manage somehow. 
Oh, how can 1 thank you?” 

“It’s all right.” 

“It isn’t all right. You’ve done so 
much for me, that now 1 must do 
something in return.” Her voice 
turned suddenly cool, and she re- 
treated from him half a step. “If I 
wasn’t pledged to be chaste with 
only one ...” 

"Please, Rose!” 

“You’re right, what must you 
think of me?” She tugged Art down 
the hallway. Looking toward the 
door to the escalator, he could see 
that a different bodyguard was now 
on duty. Rose snuggled one breast 
against Art lustily. “I’m not 
promiscuous, you know,” she 
whispered. “Not like some of those 
bluenose girls, those terrible ones 
they throw in jail.” 



“I can tell you’re nothing like 
that.” 

As they were going down the 
escalator she said: “I bet they 
didn’t feed you properly in that 
awful jail. And, knowing my 
father, he gave you nothing but 
drink. Let’s go out and get some- 
thing to eat, and we’ll talk.” 

“All right.” He had nowhere else 
to go at present. It was almost four, 
hours since they had fed him at the 
midwifer's hideout, and the whisky 
he had just taken was biting at his 
empty stomach. “Where shall we 
go?” 

“I know a place. I’m buying.” 
That seemed no more than fair, 
and he went along. They were just 
getting into the car again when 
Rose squealed, suddenly enough to 
make Art jump. “Artie, I forgot all 
about your problem, trying to help 
your poor wife save her baby! Did 
you get a chance to mention it to 
Daddy? What did he say?” 

She had the problem backwards, 
but he saw no point in enlightening 
her. “I did mention it to your 
father. He can’t do anything.” 
“Tell me more about it.” 

She sympathized and persisted 
until he had to elaborate on his 
story a little. Obviously she had the 
idea that he was trying to help Rita 
avoid an abortion, and he let her go 
on thinking so. Why upset the poor 
girl for nothing? He would share a 
meal with her, and maybe some sex 
again, and go his way and never see 
her more. 

“But where is she right now?” 
Rose questioned anxiously. By now 
she had driven the car into a drive- 
in automat of the better class and 
they had placed their orders.

“Here in Chicago . really, 
Rose, it’s painful for me to even 
talk about it. And there’s nothing 
you can do.” He reached to take a 
tray of food from a robotic servitor 
at the window. When he looked 
back at Rose she was shaking her 
head slowly, and smiling as if in 
mischief. 

“Artie, as soon as you’ve eaten 
you’re coming with me to get some 
help. I know people Daddy doesn’t 
know!” 



XII 

R ose urged him to hurry through 
the meal, and shortly they were 
on the road again. “But where are 
we going?” Art kept asking. “Who 
is it you want me to see?” 

When he began to grow angry. 
Rose at last stopped being coy. 
“We’re going to visit my psychia- 
trist, in his office.” 

“Rose, that’s not the kind of help 
I need. I’m not trying to adjust to 
my situation, I want out of it.” 
Rose dismissed such quibbles 
with a shake of her head. This time 
she was driving manually instead of 
riding on autopilot, proceeding 
slowly and cautiously, with fierce 
concentration on the job. They 
were headed straight toward the 
center of the city. 

“It's a good thing Daddy hasn’t 
started having me followed yet.” 
“Why do you say that?” 

No answer. 

“Rose, I’m sure you mean well, 
but I don’t see how this is going to 
help me in the least.” 

“I know you don’t. But wait and 

see." 



Art slumped back in his seat. He 
could demand to be taken some- 
where else, but where? Probably by 
this time Rita was waiting for him 
at the Parrs’, with a red picnic 
cooler frosting over at her side, her 
belly flat and perfect once again. 
All right, Rita and George and Ann 
had won. So let them do the 
wandering and searching for a few 
hours. Meanwhile, let Rose lead 
him where she would. 

She parked in a public garage on 
the edge of the no-private-vehicle 
zone encompassing the city’s 
center, and from there went on with 
Art by slidewalk into the multilevel 
knots of moving pedestrian ways 
that in their plastic shields 
threaded the deep canyons between 
the skyscrapers. At about forty 
stories above ground level they 
entered an office building, and 
boarded an elevator which bore 
them much higher still. From the 
elevator they walked an elegant, 
skylighted hallway, to stop at last 
before a door lettered 

RAOUL RIZZO M.D. 

D. PSYCH. 

Rizzo. Art had somewhere, re- 
cently, heard that name. He 
followed Rose into a doctor's wait- 
ing room, small and luxurious but 
empty. Not even a receptionist. 
There was an alarmingly remote 
look on Rose’s face, and she put 
sexless fingers on Art’s arm. 
“Hush. Wait.” 

After a moment an inner door 
opened. The well-dressed young 
man who emerged from it was of no 
more than middle height, but so 
emaciated that he looked taller. His 
eyes did not turn for even a moment 
to Art, or in -any other direction 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL

away from Rose. “My lady fair,” he 
said, his tense voice hardly louder 
than a whisper. 

“My true knight,” Rose breath- 
ed in answer. Her expression was 
becoming even more remote, 
moment by moment. “Oh, my 
champion.” 

They stepped closer to each 
other. They raised their right 
hands, and each caressed the air a 
few centimeters from the other’s 
face. Not once did they make actual 
physical contact. Staring woodenly 
over each other’s shoulders, they 
reminded Art of opposing chess 
pawns set down slightly off-center 
on their respective squares. 

Art just stood there. If they 
didn’t mind his watching, why 
should he? 

At last Rose turned, breaking off 
the non-embrace. “Raoul, Raoul 
my cold one, this is Art, the man 
who helped me on the tube train. 
You remember my telling you.” 

“1 thought that today I would 
have you all to myself, Rose, rose 
petal, rose essence, dear specter of 
a rose.” The psychiatrist sighed, 
still staring into the air. At last he 
roused himself and put out a hand 
to Art. In Art’s grasp the thin 
fingers felt as weak as they looked. 
Raoul’s gaze was penetrating at 
first but then it kept sliding self- 
consciously away. 

“Raoul, dearest. Today Art was 
kind enough to help me again. Now 
he has a problem of his own, and 
we’ve just got to do something 
about it for him.” 

Raoul thought this over for ten or 
fifteen seconds, nodding slowly. He 
dug a pipe out of a pocket in his 
translucent shorts. He looked from 



Rose to Art and back again. “Come 
in then, all of you,” he invited in 
his solemn near-whisper. He held 
open for them the door by which he 
had come out into the waiting 
room. 

In his inner chamber Raoul 
pushed a pair of reclining chairs to- 
gether side by side, and gestured 
for Rose and Art to seat them- 
selves. Looking out the window as 
he sat down. Art saw the June sun 
working its way lower in the north- 
west sky, beyond a palisade of 
towers and a groundcover of 
distant, much lower rooftops. 

Raoul perched himself cross- 
legged on his desk and lit his pipe. 
Judging by the aroma of the first 
fumes, the tobacco certainly con- 
tained an admixture of something 
stronger. ^ 

“Mr. Rodney.” Raoul paused 
and puffed. “You witnessed the 
greeting that passed just now be- 
tween Rose and myself. Have you 
ever beheld even a. brother and 
sister going to greater extremes of 
anti-erotism? My purpose in posing 
the question is not to shock you.” 

Art, watching the lowering sun 
and wondering if Rita could also 
see it, had not been paying close 
attention. “Are you brother and 
sister? But I thought . .” 

“No, no, we are not. Perhaps I 
failed to make my meaning plain. 
Would you have described our be- 
havior as obscene?” 

No, thought Art, just exhibition- 
istic. He doubted that the greeting 
would have been quite so extrava- 
gantly repressive had there been no 
audience. But, wanting to be a 
good fellow, and uncertain whether 
Raoul wanted to be thought ob- 



124 



GALAXY 




scene or not, he answered: “I 
suppose most people would call it 
that.” 

I t was Raoul’s turn not to listen. 

“I just wonder,” he murmured, 
as if to himself, “why did I employ 
that sibling analogy? Brother and 
sister may repress a mutual sex 
attraction and the repression is 
tolerated by society.” 

“Of course.” Art glanced over at 
Rose, wondering if she still hoped 
that he would benefit from this 
visit. Her inscrutable lenses were 
aimed steadily at Raoul. 

Raoul rocked back and forth on 
his desk and puffed his pipe. 
“Taking a larger view, are not all 
men and women in some sense 
siblings? What then is more 
natural than our occasional urges 
to escape from sex? We are all of us 
subject to the deep powers of the 
subconscious. Modern science tells 
us that dreams, produced in the 
subconscious, are attempts of the 
ego to flee the restrictions of the 
body. In every human adult lies the 
buried wish to return to sexless in- 
fancy. In all honesty, isn't letting 
these urges out into the open the 
only healthy course to take?” 

suppose.” If Art spoke 
honestly he would say he thought 
his healthiest course would be 
getting up to leave as soon as he 
could think of someplace to go. 
Rose meant well, and he didn’t 
want to hurt her feelings, but this 
was quite ridiculous. 

With an unfolding of bony legs 
Raoul got down, or rather stood 
up, from his low desk. “Personally, 
1 have never conducted an analysis 
in which I did not uncover a strong. 



buried celibacy-wish in the subject. 
Our differences from other animals 
are inescapably part of our natures, 
and we ignore them at our peril.” 
“You may be right.” Now she 
was going to have the chaste baby 
anyway and he was not going to be 
with her when she needed him the 
most. That was all his campaign to 
rescue her had accomplished. 
What had he done? But what else 
could he have done? 

“Face these things in yourself,” 
Raoul was saying, in a brooding 
voice. Behind him on his walls were 
abstract photographs, and a couple 
of Vandalist splash-paintings, up- 
to-date and arrogant in expensive 
frames. Yes, the art had been dead 
for a century, all right. “Face them 
squarely, and they will begin to lose 
their power over you.” 

Art cleared his throat. 

Raoul’s eyes fastened on his, this 
time not to be easily driven away. 
“Face the truth about what has 
happened between you and Rosa- 
mond! When you first saw her she 
was alone, she was frightened, she 
was in danger.” 

“She wasn’t exactly alone.” 
“Immediately you went to her 
aid. Your relationship thus began 
with no erotic values, but society 
tolerates that in an emergency, and 
you yourselves did not realize that 
in your hearts you wanted it that 
way. 

“When the immediate danger 
was past, perhaps you turned to 
sex? Yes. Then, when your lust was 
temporarily in abeyance, there 
came the moment of temptation. 
The forces of the subconscious were 
no longer to be denied. The fragile 
remnants of your lust were to be

sacrificed upon the altar of repres- 
sion. You wanted to flee with Rose 
from the world of flesh, to climb a 
crystal stair to an ethereal palace, 
to enter the world of sublimation. 
Yes. Perhaps you draped her 
body — ” 

“Enough of this.” Art pushed 
away his suddenly vigorous memo- 
ries of that sunset with Rose on the 
bank of a wide river. He tried to get 
to his feet forcefully but the reclin- 
ing chair betrayed him and he stag- 
gered and had to make an effort to 
keep from falling. “Look here, I 
haven’t asked you — to analyze 
me.” 

Raoul fell silent, gazing at Art 
with what seemed a mixture of pity 
and antagonism. 

“Dearest?” Rose spoke up 
timidly. “Raoul? The reason I 
thought you might be able to help 
Art is because his wife is looking for 
a midwifer. Art wants to help her 
save her baby, but there are 
obstacles.” • 

Raoul, professionally unshock- 
able, took the news in stride. “I can 
help him live with the situation, 
provided he wants to be helped.” 

Rose shook her head. “No, my 
chill one, that isn’t what I meant.” 

Raoul blinked. “What, then?” 

“Oh, for you to see your father 
about it, of course!” Rose was 
lovingly irritated by her lover’s ob- 
tuseness. 

At mention of his father, Raoul’s 
face twitched, and he laughed 
bitterly. He sat on his desk again 
and tried to relight his pipe. 

“Please, dearest. You mustn’t be 
jealous. Art and I are not having an 
affair. He and 1 are strongly erotic 
together, really we are.” 



Puff and pause. “Why do you say 
that?” 

“Who is his father?" Art asked, 
standing now with his arms folded. 

Rose flowed easily to her feet; 
probably she had some experience 
with these chairs. “1 say it because 
you are my knight. Do you think I 
could ever want to sit coldly beside 
any other man?” 

Raoul closed his eyes and let his 
pipe go out. 

Rose hovered near him, plead- 
ing. “My champion! Won’t you do 
this little thing for me? Take Art to 
see your father?” 

“Who is his father?” 

Raoul’s eyes opened. His whisper 
had a broken sound. “For you, my 
lady, my chaste one, I will do it. 
Sometime tomorrow.” 

“Tomorrow might be too late for 
his poor wife. Couldn’t you do it 
now?” 

“I thought that you and I would 
have this evening alone together.” 
"Please. Take Art to your father 
now. 1 set you this task, to prove 
that you revere me.” 

“Then 1 have no choice but to 
obey.” Raoul came to life and slid 
off the desk . “Will you wait for me 
here, my lady?” 

Rose squirmed as if with re- 
pressed desire and took a step 
back, avoiding any pgssible physi- 
cal contact with her knight. “I’ll 
wait here all night for you, if need 
be. When you come back, 
maybe . we’ll play chess.” 

"My lady, not that childish 
game, I beg of you. Anything else.” 
“Who is your father?” Art asked 
the ceiling. “And what good is see- 
ing him supposed to do me?” Like 
as not Rizzo Sr. would turn out to

GALAXY 




be the head of Chicago’s branch of 
the Family Planning office. Soon 
everyone in the city would know 
about Rita's warped reproductive 
cravings and her illegal plans. No 
one would do anything to save her, 
but everyone would know, even ir- 
redeemable idiots who thought 
chess was a childish game. 

After staring incredulously at Art 
for a moment, Raoul asked: “You 
don’t know who my father is?” And 
then he laughed bitterly and long. 



S till not knowing, Art went 
along with Raoul, first in a taxi 
lo a garage, and then in Raoul’s 
car. In spite of all, a nagging hope 
persisted . 

Whatever his occupation might 
be, Rizzo Sr. had evidently made a 
success of it. The blockhouse in 
which he lived was every bit as 
high-walled and luxurious as the 
Jamisons’. The Rizzo garage space 
was even larger than the arch- 
bishop's had been, and protected 
by heavier gates. As Raoul eased 
his line car to a stop and turned its 
turbines off, Art was once more 
nagged by the sense of having re- 
cently heard the Rizzo name in 
some other connection. Was it 
something about this very struc- 
ture, Rizzo's townhouse? 

In a short passage connecting the 
garage with an underground level 
of the Rizzo home, a pair of non- 
uniformed guards were stationed. 
They looked meaner than the Jami- 
sons' Jove, though neither of them 
was quite as large. 

“Who’s your pal, Doc?” one of 
them asked. 

“A man 1 know.” Young Rizzo 



smiled wryly. “A man with a prob- 
lem, I expect my father will be able 
to help him, if he wants to help.” 
“Maybe you shoulda just 
phoned," said the other guard. 
“The Magnifico’s sorta been lying 
low the past few days.” 

The what? thought Art. 

“You know how my father likes 
to do business face to face.” 

The pair of gate-blockers looked 
doubtfully at Art. He could place 
them now. They were the ones who 
had sat on him in the brothel. Not 
the same men, but the type. Rizzo, 
Rizzo, he almost had it. 

“Well, let’s see if you’re carryin’ 
anything. Doc, the boss is in his 
study now, if you wanna go up.” 
“I’ll be back in a minute, Rod- 
ney,” said Raoul, and went on 
ahead. The two guards began to 
pat Art’s pockets and bulges, 
searching him. Rizzo. Little old 
Alfie in the slumburb tavern, say- 
ing Vic Rizzo’s townhouse was 
bombed. Oh, great stargazing 
quadruplets. 

Rizzo Jr. was soon back from his 
filial visit. His face was flushed, but 
seemingly not with joy. “He says 1 
can bring him up." 

“Awright.” 

Art rode up with Raoul in a large 
and fancily paneled elevator, which 
disgorged them into a room like the 
entry hall of a small art museum. 
Marble columns supported a high, 
vaulted ceiling, and across one end 
of the room there burbled a com- 
plex of waterfalls and fountains 
and pools, complete with fish. For 
all its size the hall was almost 
crowded with paintings and 
statuary. On the wall opposite the 
elevator, in a place of dominance

127 




over the other objects d’art, was an 
ancient life-sized crucifix of wood, 
done in a realistically gory Spanish 
style. Its paint, once red and 
brown, had aged into a grayish 
dullness that with the cracks and 
holes gave the figure a look of 
frighteningly patient endurance. 

Raoul led Art across the museum 
hall and opened a massive wooden 
door. “In here,” he ordered tersely. 

The room behind the door was 
also quite large, with a beamed 
ceiling and woodpaneled walls. 
Might it all be real, virgin, tree-seg- 
ment wood? Anyone whose house 
had fountains and waterfalls — 

Art caught one breath-tripping 
glimpse of a girl, heavily garment- 
ed, even her face veiled, before she 
moved out of sight behind some 
opaque woven draperies. And 
there, almost as startling as the girl 
and the paneled walls, was a huge 
genuine fireplace that appeared to 
be consuming genuine logs. 

At least four chess sets, of stone 
or wood or metal, all large and or- 
nately carved, were visible on tables 
or in display cases. A suit of armor 
stood at Art’s right hand. What 
appeared to be medieval torches 
standing in brackets on the walls 
bore warm and writhing electric 
flames. Upon one paneled wall 
there hung a crossed pair of long, 
pointed weapons, pikes or lances of 
some kind; on the opposite wall a 
brace of submachine guns were 
mounted in the same way. Walls 
and furniture bore many framed 
photographs evidently reproduced 
from twentieth century newspapers 
or films, showing men in the ob- 
scenely heavy garb of that time. 
The men smiled unpleasantly and 



many of them were carrying fire- 
arms. From the upper walls there 
looked down at least a dozen paint- 
ings of a more distant time, mostly 
of men in archaic costume wearing 
swords and accompanied by 
crouching dogs. These paintings 
looked old and dim enough to be 
originals. The Magnifico, the 
guard had said. 

The Magnifico came forward 
amid his treasures. His small torso 
was plump beneath his shimmer- 
ing, partially translucent dressing 
gown, but his face still showed 
some of the leanness of his son’s. 

His flat voice came out around a 
cigar. “So, you’re the man with 
troubles. I was curious to see you, I 
wondered w'hat kinda man my son 
would bring here to get his troubles 
fixed.” 

Art made himself look straight 
into the Magnifico’s direct and 
seldom-blinking eyes. The reality of 
power before him was as apparent 
as the hardness of the suit of armor 
at his right. Art could feel the world 
and all its probabilities shifting 
again, crazily and unpredictably 
beneath his feet. 

Art cleared his throat. “My 
trouble is a fairly simple one.” 

“So. I guess my son can only fix 
the high-priced troubles in his 
office. The simple ones he still has 
to bring to me. Whaf s yours?” 
“My wife is in a birth-mill, here 
in Chicago.” Facing the reality of 
power in Rizzo’s eyes, Art had a 
moment of weakness, of indecision. 
But now his choice was clear-cut, 
inescapable. “I want to stop her 
from going through with it.” 

“So, w'ho says 1 know anything 
about birth-mills?”

rriHE fireplace roared and seemed 
to make the room too hot. 
Somewhere behind Art, Raoul 
fidgeted. Art said the next thing 
that came into his head: “1 see 
you’re a chessplayer.” Every time 
he glanced around the crowded 
room he spotted another set some- 
where. 

Rizzo removed his cigar from his 
mouth and raised his eyebrows. 
“You play?” 

Art smiled faintly. “I’m a 
master." 

“No! You are?” The cigar went 
flipping into the fireplace. Rizzo 
almost bowed. “Come in here — 
whazza name? Mr. Rodney? You 
come in here, there’s somethin’ 1 
want you t’ look at.” 

He held open for Art the drapes 
behind which the veiled girl had 
vanished. At the same time he 
raised his eyes to stare coldly over 
Art’s shoulder. "Hey Raoul, go fix 
yourself a drink or something. Or 
get out. Hey, if you see Penny 
around maybe she’ll wanna screw. 
She's been sublimatin’ her urges 
quite a bit lately.” 

The only answer was the sound of 
the heavy wooden door softly clos- 
ing: probably. Art thought, it could 
not be slammed. He went on 
through the drapes and Rizzo 
followed, into a smaller adjunct of 
the study. The girl was not in sight. 

“You say you’re a rated master, 
Mr. Rodney?" 

“Yes. However not in this state. 
In California.” 

“I’d appreciate it if you’d take a 
look at this position 1 got set up 
here. Tell me what you think about 
it.” 

On a board on an antique table 



were ebony and ivory men arranged 
in an intricate early middle game or 
late opening position. At first 
glance Art took it for one of the new 
computer-discovered variations of 
the neo-Shapiro defense, but one of 
White’s knights was oddly placed, 
changing the w hole complexion of 
the game. 

"Interesting.” said Art. It really 
w as. “One of your games?” 

"Nah, not a real game. Oh, Mr. 
Rodney, meet Penny.” 

The veiled girl had returned from 
somewhere amid velvet hangings, 
moving on soft silent feet. Under 
the Magnifico’s smiling but watch- 
ful eye. Art kissed Penny hello with 
a fervent show of lust, and pushed a 
fondling hand inside the innermost 
of her voluminous garments. 

Rizzo chuckled benevolently. 
“Nov run along, little lady.” 

■ Peony paused to blow an open- 
mouthed kiss to Art before she let 
the drapes fall into place behind 
her. 

Rizzo, staring at the place where 
she had vanished, released a small 
sigh. "That son of mine just don’t 
know how to keep a woman." Then 
he brightened. "That reminds me. 
You hear the one about this 
traveling salesgirl, she stops at a 
lamasery to sell blankets?" 

“I’m not sure.” 

Evidently he was not going to 
hear it now . Rizzo w'as still looking 
after the girl. “That Penny, 
though. She’s been livin’ with me 
here almost a year now, and I’ve 
never touched her. Imagine.” He 
sighed again. “I hardly seen a cen- 
timeter of her skin in all that time. 

1 did see her ankle once, when she 
was walkin’ upstairs, and I nearly 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



129 




went dizzy. 1 tell you, when 1 finally 
get rid of that girl she’ll prob’ly 
take a lot of loot along, but she’s 
been worth it, everything a man 
could want. Whaddya think about 
this opening setup, now?” 

"Interesting.” With some relief 
Art turned back to the board. 

“Y’see, I'm foolin’ around with a 
little analysis here. 1 like to take the 
book theory, you know, and try t’ 
find improvements in it. The fellas 
who write them chess books some- 
times don’t know much about the 
practical side of the game. Chas- 
tity, I’d like t’ get out and play in 
some tournaments. But 1 got too 
much business to think about.” 
Rizzo glanced up from the board. 
“I'm a investment counselor,” 

"I see. I was hoping to play in a 
big tournament myself, but then 
this trouble came up involving my 
wife. That makes it very hard to 
concentrate on chess.” 

“Oh, yeah. She’s in some birth- 
mill, you said. Tell me about that.” 
Art recited his story. By now he 
had it down pat, like some politi- 
cian's standard speech, that could 
be edited a little here and there to 
suit the day’s audience even as it 
was being delivered. “Possibly it’s 
too late and the operation’s already 
over. But if at all possible I w'ant to 
stop her from going through with 
it. For her own good.” 

"And you say you talked to this 
doctor who’s gonna do it, but you 
don’t know his name?” 

“Right. He’s one of these Chris- 
tian priests, I know' that much. Tall 
fellow , kind of narrow-shouldered, 
with a sandy beard.” 

Rizzo nodded thoughtfully and 
started to pace the room. For the 



time being chess was forgotten. He 
lit a fresh cigar and squinted 
through the smoke of it, studying 
Art’s face. 

“Whatever people she’s paid, or 
promised to pay, can have their 
money,” said Art, as free with 
George’s substance as with his own. 
"But my idea is this: the pregnancy 
can just be terminated legally, and 
as far as my wife will know, some- 
thing just went wrong. The fetus 
turned out not to be viable, or 
whatever the medical term is. 
That’s simple, and there’s no 
trouble in it for anyone.” 

Rizzo smiled faintly. “1 kinda 
taken a liking to you, Mr. Rodney. 
Course you understand I don’t 
know nothin’ about midwifers — 
but what did you say your wife’s 
name is, what does she look like?” 
Art told him, and ran through 
the standard speech again, going 
into greater detail. His tongue 
stumbled reluctantly at times. He 
felt afraid to start hoping again. 

Rizzo heard him out, then 
nodded decisively. “Yeah, I see. 
Too bad. Any day now she’s gonna 
have the operation, huh?” 

“1 got the impression it might be 
at any hour.” 

"Uh-huh. Some of these priests 
don’t stick to religion, they’re real 
cultists and mix into things where 
they don’t belong. Excuse me a 
minute, I got a phone call to make. 
Look over this position here mean- 
while, hey? Tell me how do you like 
White’s chances.” 

1 e ft alone. Art heaved a tremen- 
j dous silent sigh. He sat down 
at the chess table and leaned his 
head forward into his hands, letting 



130 



GALAXY 




his eyes close. A great exhaustion 
was coming down upon hitn. It 
came with a disturbing' sense of 
permanence, as if he might never 
be able to rest long enough to re- 
cover. But his feelings didn’t 
matter, if Rita could be saved. 
Someday he would be able to tell 
her what he had done, and some- 
day she would understand and 
thank him for it. 

Art opened his eyes and found 
the chessmen waiting. Rizzo would 
expect a masterly evaluation of the 
position, and that was little enough 
for him to ask. 

Four or five minutes of Art’s 
flawed attention sufficed to 
convince him that the Rizzo Varia- 
tion was a bust. Rizzo evidently 
thought that White’s advanced 
knight could not be readily dis- 
lodged from its fine post, but Rizzo 
had overlooked a thing or two, and 
White was going to have to retreat 
and waste a tempo, and stand 
poorly in the middle game. These 
were the facts, but they had better 
be conveyed diplomatically. 

In a few minutes the Magnifico 
was back. His mood had brighten- 
ed into something like joviality. 
“Like I said, I know nothin’ about 
any birth-mills. Still, 1 got a hunch 
that things are gonna work out 
okay from your point of view. Just a 
feeling. Well, should we have a 
little game? How about a drink, 
somethin’ to eat?” 

“Certainly.” Art got off another 
sigh, like a man dropping a weight. 
But there was the weight still cling- 
ing to his shoulders. 

He began to rearrange the chess- 
men to begin a game. Someday she 
would understand. 



XIII 

tying chastely beside Marjorie 
I j in the dark bed between their 
darkened hotel rooms, Fred was 
pouring out his heart. 

“Ah, who’m I kidding. I’m not 
ready for even a brown belt yet. I 
could Te. if I settled down and 
worked at it. I dunno, though, if 
it’s really worth the effort. AH the 
lumps and bruises, and you never 
get rich. Karate just gets you flunky 
jobs, like this part-time bodyguard 
thing I got going now with this Dr. 
Hammad. Ivor, he’s the regular 
bodyguard, says the pay never 
amounts to much. 

“George does all right, though, 
running his own dojo. He must, you 
should see his house. I don’t know 
what he charges for private lessons. 
If I could only get myself a setup 
someplace like he’s got. And his 
brother-in-law does all right too. 
Ann, that’s my sister, says Art 
holds down an electronics job and 
wins prizes. He must have bread 
cornin’ out of his ears. He wins his 
prizes playing chess, real good at it 
I guess. 

“You know something 1 was 
good at, though, besides karate, 
was woodcarving. I won a couple 
prizes when I was a kid. My folks 
showed off the trophies, but they 
never paid any attention to the stuff 
I carved. Finally 1 didn’t carve any 
more. Maybe if I’d kept up with 
that I could set myself up hand- 
carving chess sets. Art would prob- 
ably give me some clues on what 
sizes and shapes the players like 
and where to sell them. You know, 
I carved a nice religious cross once 
for Ann, when she got baptized. I 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



131 




did it from pictures in books. That 
was after she left home and married 
George. She still has it on the wall 
in her kids’ room. George don’t go 
for that religious stuff himself, but 
he don't care what Ann does.” 

Fred raised himself on one elbow 
in the bed. making his plastic glad- 
rag cloak crackle faintly all around 
him. Marjorie’s form, similarly 
draped, lay still and straight beside 
him. The room was too dark for 
him to read her face but still he 
could perceive the tenseness of her 
body. A tinny, tiny sound, so faint 
that he could hear it only intermit- 
tently, leaked out into the room 
from the earplugs of her pocket 
hifi. Fred could not make out any 
of the words but he thought it was 
Orlando, one of the season’s top re- 
cording stars, reciting his own 
verse. Marj had said she liked to 
have Orlando on for background 
music whenever she got started out- 
ward to the stars. 

“Anyway," Fred went on, “the 
carving business is not bad in some 
w ays if you can get a reputation as 
an artist, but there are certain 
drawbacks. You have to have the 
right wood. And when you go to sell 
your work, it’s hard to prove it’s 
really handcarved unless they’ve 
actually seen you do it. I mean 
there are woodworking machines 
that can be set to take off little 
irregular chips and leave little 
marks just like a hand knife, and 
the machines do the job a hundred 
limes faster. It’s like man in the 
modern world has to contend with 
machines at every turn, you know 
what I mean?” 

Majorie W'as nodding, nodding 
gently. She could understand, she 



could understand it all and heal 
him of the pain of it. Above Or- 
lando’s tinny moans Fred now 
could hear another little moan, but 
in his girl’s warm breathing voice. 
Could it be that she was weeping 
for him. He reached to chastely 
touch her hand, and tried to think 
of words to tell her how' much it 
meant to him to have her here to- 
night. 

M arjorie’s little moan swelled 
quickly into an exasperated 
snarl. She sat up in her crackling 
cloak, and with the hand he had 
touched she reached up to pull her 
earplugs out. “You twin!" she 
stage-whispered angrily at Fred. 
“What’s the matter with you? I’ve 
run into some horny stallions in my 
time, but . what do you think I 
am, your shrink? If you can’t talk it 
chill any better than you do, just 
fall back in your plastic and let me 
listen to someone who can.” She 
flopped her head back on the pillow' 
and turned up the volume on the 
hifi slightly. 

Into the silence, Orlando’s pe- 
culiar, almost metallic voice 
recited: 

. up on gladrag hilll 
yon left me so chilli . 
Fred almost hit her. Why didn’t 
he? Only because he was afraid she 
wouldn’t be hurt by his blows at all, 
wouldn’t cry out or fold up or 
bleed, but would just ignore his 
efforts the way his dream-op- 
ponents usually did. 

Hands shaking with the urge to 
hit, he got up slowly on his own side 
of the bed, and pulled the stiff 
opaque plastic poncho off over his 
head and threw it down. He turned 



132 



GALAXY 




away from the bed and pulled his 
clothes on and went on out of the 
room without once looking back. 

Outside Ihe sky was darkening 
and the streetlights coming on. In 
the Megiddo Coffee House Fred 
spotted Lewandowski and the Wolf 
sitting at a table together, teetering 
restlessly in their chairs. Making 
sure that his own face was hard, he 
walked to their table amid the 
baby-crying music that at least was 
not Orlando’s, and amid the 
smoke, and saw their faces harden, 
challenging and welcoming him. 

“Let’s go cruise, men,” he said, 
standing beside their table. Wolfs 
pelt turned to look at him, with the 
movement of Wolfs own head and 
shoulders turning, and the two sets 
of teeth showed Fred their grins. 

“Quads and quints, I’m with 
ya,” said Lewandowski, stretching 
to his feet. “I been sitting here five 
hours now, let’s go find some live 
fun.” 

They cruised out of the Megiddo 
and right away Wolf began talking 
about how to organize a street gang 
and establish a territory of streets 
and blocks. Fred heard without 
listening, without caring. As they 
passed some parking meters Fred 
tried to smash one with a kick, but 
it was too strongly built and he only 
hurt his foot. He thought he 
managed to keep the pain in his 
foot from showing in his face, as he 
was still managing to keep a lot of 
other things from showing, but it 
was all coming to a head. 

They cruised the narrower, 
dimmer slidewalks. “Hey,” Lewan- 
dowski whispered, stopping the 
other two, "here comes fun.” 

It was a young couple walking 



alone. They slowed timidly as they 
drew near, but that only made their 
fate a certainty. Fred and Wolf and 
Lewandowski crowded them right 
off the walk onto the well-mani- 
cured grass. 

“You’re a jobholder, ain’t you, 
pal?” asked Fred, slapping the 
young man. The youth began to 
wrestle ineffectually, and Fred 
slammed a fist into his ribs full 
power. The young man collapsed, 
croaking. Fred bent down and 
seized one of his manicured fingers 
and w'renched it back savagely until 
lie thought it must be broken. 
“Now try and work,” he said. 

The young man 'sat on the 
ground yelping and stuttering with 
his broken finger and cracked ribs. 
Fred had had enough, so instead of 
shutting him up he walked away. 
After a quick glance around to 
make sure that no one was coming 
to interfere, he looked to see what 
Wolf and Lewandowski were doing 
with the girl. 

“Don’t hurt me!” she was 
squealing. “Take my money, wrap 
me, but don’t hurt me!” 

“Who’d w'ant to wrap you, 
sister?” Lewandowski laughed. He 
had her purse tucked under his 
arm, and he was tearing off her 
electrostatically-clinging costume, 
while Wolf kept her from running 
away. Lew'andowski peeled the last 
bit of silvery film from her plump 
body, and then shoved her away so 
she fell, sadly naked and unattrac- 
tive. She sat there quivering 
flabbily, staring at them in abject 
terror, while Wolf and Lewan- 
dowski rifled her purse. 

Some people at the end of the 
block were looking their way and 



LOVE CONQUERS ALI 



133 




pointing. “Come on, let’s go,” 
urged Fred, starting away. 

Wolf delayed a moment, bending 
over the girl. She screamed loudly 
and he jumped up and came hurry- 
ing after Fred and Lewandowski. 
For some reason the three of them 
started running. They ran for a 
block, switched slidewalks athleti- 
cally, and ran again, looking over 
their shoulders. There was no pur- 
suit. and they slowed to a casual 
walk. Fat Lewandowski was 
puffing hard. 

Wolf was holding up the head of 
his pelt, waiting for the other two to 
notice it. Fred saw that the sharp- 
pointed plastic teeth were redden- 
ed. “I left m’ brand on her, where it 
counts," Wolf snickered, and Fred 
wondered, without caring, where 
the place that counted was. 

Lewandowski still had a handful 
of silvery film, and was tearing it 
into little bits which he scattered 
like confetti. Good-humoredly he 
demanded: “How much bread that 
guy have on him, Lohmann? Hey 
Fred, you get the bread?” 

Lewandowski laughed at his own 
rhyme, and they all laughed, feel- 
ing good. Fred's sense of power and 
self-assertion, brought to a peak by 
the terror with which the girl had 
looked at him, was not spoiled by 
the realization that he had 
forgotten to take the young man’s 
money. 

“Naw, I didn’t get it,” he ad- 
mitted cheerfully. “But what th’ 
purity." 

“Didn’t get it? Why?” Lewan- 
dowski too was more amused than 
upset. 

‘“Cause 1 didn’t give a quint 
about it. What the purity!” But 



now the omission did begin to 
bother Fred a little, mainly because 
the young jobholder would be com- 
forted by having retained his money 
and his papers. All right, next time 
Fred would make up for the over- 
sight. Fred had never done any- 
thing quite like this before. As a 
kid he had been in fights, but never 
launched such an unprovoked 
attack. But already he knew that 
there would be a next time, and 
then he wouldn’t stop with just 
breaking a finger and maybe crack- 
ing a rib or two. Next time? Quin- 
tuplets, yes, there would be one. 

T he Magnifico, when he finally 
returned, furrowed his brow 
over the chessboard and took half 
an hour to make twelve moves. 
Then Art managed to let him win a 
pawn. Rizzo was an intense and 
serious player, with a drivingly ag- 
gressive style that would probably 
win him most of the amateur games 
he played. Though he mentioned 
vaguely having taken part in some 
tournaments, he seemed to have 
little competitive experience since 
he accepted a pawn from a master 
without apparent suspicion. Maybe 
he had played in prison somewhere. 
Art, headache-ridden, wished he 
had given away a knight or bishop 
and so provided himself with an ex- 
cuse to resign. But no, that might 
be putting it on too thick. The best 
thing was to arrange a draw. If only 
Rizzo would not take so long to 
move! 

A man opened the study door. 
“Chief?” 

Rizzo grunted in exasperation, 
got up, and went out. Art shifted in 
his chair, took a bite from the 



134 



GALAXY 




tasteless sandwich that had been 
provided for him, took a sip from 
the accompanying drink, and look- 
ed at his watch. Nine o’clock, al- 
most. It would be dark outside. His 
headache was waxing fat. He could 
ask for aspirin but it wouldn’t mix 
well with the drink. 

He meant to spend a lot of time 
and effort, from now on, making it 
up to Rita for what she was losing, 
or thought that she was losing. 
Right now, for some reason, all of 
Rita’s weak points — mostly insig- 
nificant things, of course, like her 
occasional stutter — kept popping 
up in Art’s thoughts; but all in all 
she was a good wife. What was he 
thinking? She was a purity of a 
good wife, the best of wives, and 
someday she would understand. 
When that day came it would be a 
great relief to be able to tell her how 
he had managed things, and to 
have her understand and thank 
him for it. It wasn't as if he had had 
a real child of hers done away with. 
It wasn’t anything at all like that, 
even if they could move. They 
would smile over all this then. Over 
all their foolish ideas and fears. 

Someday they would. Still only 
nine o’clock. Yes, his watch was 
still running. Twins, how this night 
seemed to last and last. 

The Magnifico came back 
through the draperies, smiling and 
rubbing his hands together, look- 
ing eagerly at the board. “Where’d 
you move? Like I said, I don’t know 
about these places where they have 
your wife. But if I was to give you 
advice like a father I’d say don’t 
worry, these things have a way of 
working themselves out.” 

“I moved my queen here. And I 



want to thank you.” 

“For advice?” Rizzo’s laugh was 
deep and rich, and still it managed 
to be nasty. “Advice is cheap.” 
The door opened again. “Chief?” 
“Oh, Gramma’s chastity. Look* 
Mr. Rodney, you don’t mind, hey? 
I guess we can't continue our game 
tonight.” 

“Of course.” Art stood up, try- 
ing to hide his relief. “Some other 
time maybe. We’ll call this one a 
draw.” 

“Sure, sure, maybe another day. 
Look, I'm gonna have one of my 
friends see you safely on your way.” 
A taciturn man nearly as big as 
Jove came out to guide Art on the 
slidewalks and ride with him; 
maybe Rizzo’s cars were all out on 
business. The guardian rode 
silently and protectively at Art’s 
side until they drew near the Parrs’. 
Art didn’t want him comings to the 
door. “It’s all right, you can go 
back now. This is a safe neighbor- 
hood." 

He rode on under the black sky 
and the daylight streetlights that 
somehow w ere nothing like the day 
at all. What would he tell George 
and Ann when he got back to 
them? Nothing. Why should he 
have to tell them anything? Never 
mind, some words would come. 

He looked sharply over both 
shoulders; his escort was well out of 
sight already, and there was no one 
else in view. He glided past a clock 
in a vendor’s window, and checked 
it automatically against his watch. 
Only a little after nine; why did he 
bother to worry about the time? If 
only this headache would let up. 

At an intersection he heard loud 
voices in the dark, coming from 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



135 




along the walk that came to cross 
his at right angles. A streetlight 
must be out, it was so dark in that 
direction. He saw an arm wave, 
though, an extended imperious 
hand, and a voice called: “Hey. 
Hey you, hold up.” At least he 
thought those were the words. 

Art ran. Each jog of his body 
sent a stab of pain flaring up from 
the base of his skull to exit on his 
pate. The voice, or voices, were 
raised now in a babble of threats 
and pursuing feet came pounding 
in his wake. 

He tried to yell for help, but only 
the tortured wheezing sounds of an 
exhausted runner left his mouth. 
The wall of gray faintness, that he 
had last seen following his struggle 
in the whorehouse, rose up quite, 
soon to mask the world. 

Art stumbled, and had the sen- 
sation of losing consciousness for 
just a moment as he fell. Were they 
kicking him, hitting him already? 
No, it was only the pain in his head 
and the indirect jarring as he fell to 
elbows and knees on the smooth 
and smoothly moving walk. Where 
were his attackers, then? 

With a grateful shudder he 
realized that there was no one near- 
by. They had left him for more 
sporting game. Or had he really 
managed to outrun them all? 

Rizzo sent them, Rizzo sent 
them, said the irrational panic in- 
side his buzzing head, but that 
made no sense at all. Rizzo liked 
him, and anyway Rizzo’s agent 
would not have been so easily 
eluded. But still Art could not get 
rid of Rizzo’s name. It kept coming 
up like something that had to be 
vomited. 



Art glimpsed a street sign and 
knew that he was still on the correct 
walk. He tried to get up on his feet 
again but couldn’t, not right away. 
He rode on all fours, in terror of 
meeting someone. 



T he guard at the pedestrian en- 
trance of the Parrs’ blockhouse 
took no chances on being tricked 
out of his bulletproof booth. First 
he shut the steel grillwork gate be- 
hind Art’s crawling figure, then got 
on the house phone, and only then 
came out of his booth to try to help. 

A few moments later George 
came running up, his face a taut 
mask. Once they helped Art to his 
feet, he was able to stand. The 
faintness returned for a moment 
but then abated swiftly, although 
the headache pain went on and on. 

They asked him where he had 
been hurt, and which way his 
attackers went. These days if you 
saw a human being knocked down, 
squashed like a bug beneath a run- 
ver box in the road, you just as- 
sumed some other human being 
had done it to him. 

“I — I got away from them some- 
how. I’m just winded. From 
running.” 

George said to the guard: “I 
wouldn’t call the cops yet, hey 
Casey?” 

“All right, no law says 1 have to 
in a case like this. Wouldn’t do any 
good anyway.” 

“I’m all right,” Art muttered, 
finding he could do without sup- 
port as he and George passed on 
into the interior of the block. “How 
are the kids?” 

“Okay. Come on in and rest, 



136 



GALAXY 




Art. You look like you've been 
through the mill.” At the Parrs’ 
patio door, Ann came to meet 
them. “Put that thing down,” said 
George. “We’re not invaded.” 
“Ohh,” she murmured, sagging 
briefly against a wall. Art saw now 
that she was carrying a carving 
knife with a gaily decorated blade 
in her right hand, holuing it as if 
ready to thrust. For a moment he 
could also see in her face all the 
strain of the last few days, and he 
could see how she would look when 
she was middle-aged and when she 
was old. Then she turned away to 
take the knife back to the kitchen. 

George pulled forward a chair in 
which Art gratefully sank down. 
Then George said: “We’ve just now 
had word from Rita’s doctor. The 
one who operated. She’s all right.” 
“Operated?” Art started to his 
feet again. “Then — ?” 

“Sit down. She’s all right. I got 
the code-word message on when 
and where to pick up her and the 
baby.” 

Suddenly this was all, in essence, 
very familiar. Old stuff. It had 
happened to him twice before, with 
Timmy and with Paula. “How’s the 
baby?” 

“Oh, the birth went okay. Code- 
word for a healthy boy.” George 
bent down, squinting at Art, his 
face going all blurry in Art’s vision. 
“You all right?” 

“I’m all right,” said Art. “All 
right now.” He was crying. 

XIV 

T onight Dr. Matthew Hammad 
was working late office hours, 
and he happened to be performing 



an abortion on a teenaged girl when 
the phone call came in. 

“Says to tell you it’s life or 
death,” his receptionist informed 
him. “Really vehement about it.” 
Behind the receptionist’s image on 
the intercom he could see on the 
wall of his outer office, just some 
grapes and Bacchus’ elbow showing 
in part of a painting visible there. 

“What name?” Hammad asked, 
looking across the supine figure of 
his abortion patient. He was irri- 
tated at the interruption and yet 
professionally unwilling to ignore 
the possibility that the life-or-death 
claim was true. 

“Said he was calling for a Ms. 
Chester. But I didn’t know that you 
had any patient by that name.” 

“Oh.” Hammad glanced down. 
The young girl draped in translu- 
cent sheeting on the treatment 
table had the music earphones on, 
and the look in her eyes was far- 
away. “All right. I’ll take it in 
here.” He touched the girl on the 
arm and when she had loosened ah' 
earphone and looked up inquiring- 
ly, he said: “We’ll just let this work, 
for a minute. Are you comfort- 
able?” Resting on the table be- 
tween her raised knees, the Auto- 
bort looked something, like a small 
vacuum cleaner, or some unearthly 
alien in sexual union with the girl, 
its slender sterile organ of plastic 
and flexible glass extended into her 
body. 

She said: “I’m starting to get a 
cramp inside.” 

“Well, next time come in sooner, 
and we can do a simple menstrual 
regulation. Those are a lot easier, 
you know. Next time don’t wait 
until you’re this far along.”

The girl, pouting at the mild lec- 
ture, put her earphone on snugly 
again and Hammad went over to 
the phoneplate. He punched the 
button to take the incoming call. 
“Ms. Chester” was a code word, 
and one that Hammad knew he had 
better not ignore. 

The caller kept his own phone- 
plate blanked, as Hammad expect- 
ed, but the doctor recognized the 
voice from a few previous calls. 
What the voice said this time was 
guarded and indirect, and the mes- 
sage was being relayed from some- 
one else, but still the message came 
through plainly. 

“Yes, yes, I understand.” Now 
Hammad was frowning. “Well, it 
wasn’t my intention to make 
trouble when I made the referral. 
Mrs. ah, Chester’s whereabouts are 
not known to me now with any cer- 
tainty.” Now' Hammad understood 
why this call was being made; every 
time overlords of illegal business 
had the chance, they tried to em- 
barrass the operations of their 
rivals in midwifery, the religious 
cultists who ran their birth-mills 
w ithout paying tribute for the privi- 
lege. 

“I can only guess whether I’ll be 
able to reach her and, ah, provide 
the therapy.” Even while he was en- 
gaged in this difficult call, 
Hammad kept a conscientious phy- 
sician’s eye on the progress the 
Autobort w as making. The girl was 
now quite relaxed, soothed by light 
sedation and music and the mild 
sexual stimulation of the machine. 
Through the tubing into the recep- 
tacle of clear glass on the vacuum 
cleaner’s back there now flowed the 
debris from the dismemberment 



within the womb. Now a few ribs, 
fishbone clear and soft but recog- 
nizable to the trained eye. Now a 
knee joint, which Hammad also 
could readily identify. Now parts of 
the skull and brain. 

“Yes, I understand.” His frown 
deepened as he stood listening to 
the phoneplate voice. Certain 
powerful people, those who made it 
possible for hint to continue in the 
illegal sideline of his profession, 
were displeased that he still made 
referrals to the cultists. “Yes, I’m 
sorry." Try to help out a friend 
whose sister was having problems 
and look where it got you. Now 
which would he rather have angry 
at him, George Parr or Vie Rizzo? 
There was always South America, 
he thought to himself. Meanwhile, 
George Parr need never know 
everything that went on, while Vic 
Rizzo evidently already did. 

“All right, then, I’ll do every- 
thing I can. At once. You can de- 
pend on me to take care of it.” 

His caller blanked off. Looking 
grimmer than ever, Hammad kept 
the phoneplate in hand and punch- 
ed a number rapidly. Waiting, he 
continued to keep a dutiful watch 
on his tabled patient. She was 
coming along nicely. “Hello, let me 
speak to Ivor. This is Dr. 
Hammad. Oh. Well, whenever he 
comes back, or as soon as you can 
reach him, will you tell him to cal! 
me back at once. It’s rather urgent. 
Thank you.” He blanked off and at 
once began to punch again. 

W hen Fred got back to the Y 
and found the message wait- 
ing for him at the desk, he wasted 
no time in hurrying to Hammad’s 



138 



GALAXY 




office; he wanted to hang onto his 
job, part-time or not. 

Hammad ushered him directly 
into an inner consultation room 
and shut the door. ‘‘Lohmann, 
there’s something very important 
that’s just come up, and I haven’t 
been able to get hold of Ivor. It 
can't wait. You haven’t been work- 
ing for me very long, but I think I 
can rely on you — right?” 

Fred nodded at once, and felt the 
butterflies start up in his stomach. 
His big chance — could this be it? 

“Fred, the situation is this. 
There’s a fetal specimen that has to 
be reclaimed. This woman— she’s 
not one of my patients. I’m doing 
this for a colleague — has carried off 
a specimen that according to law 
should have been destroyed, and 
she’s likely to get several innocent 
people in trouble by doing so.” 
Fred nodded. 

"There’ll be a nice bonus for you 
if you can carry this off. We’d pre- 
fer that the police not be involved in 
this at all, if you understand me.” 
“Yeah, 1 got the idea.” 

“Good. Now, from past experi- 
ence with the people who have 
been encouraging this woman to do 
the wrong thing, 1 can tell you just 
where she’s likely to be waiting to 
be picked up by some of her 
relatives or friends. It’s down on 
South Shore beach. Do you have a 
reliable friend or two to take along 
in case of trouble?” 

“Yeah, sure.” With any luck at 
all he would be able to find Lewan- 
dowski or Wolf, or both of them, 
back at the Megiddo. Lewandow- 
ski, being a native Chicagoan, 
would certainly be able to lead him 
to South Shore beach, and either of 



them would be a good back-up man 
if he shouJd need one. “I can 
handle it fpr you, chief. If she’s 
there and she’s got it with her. 
Don't worry about a thing.” 

art and George had time for only 
a few hours’ sleep before they 
started out on the slidewalks at 
about an hour before dawn. When 
Ann came to wake him. Art sat up 
with a start, but he felt rested. The 
pain was still there in the top of his 
head, but not bad enough to keep 
him from concentrating on other 
matters. 

George had dug out a couple of 
old fishing poles and some other 
fishing gear for them to carry, to 
provide a plausible reason for being 
out if they fell under the eye of the 
police. He said a lot of fishermen 
went to the lake in the early morn- 
ing, this time of year. *They briefly 
considered calling a cab for the 
trip, but with cabdrivers required 
to file complete reports on all 
passengers for the police com- 
puters, that was about as risky as 
being stopped and questioned. 

On their southwest passage 
through the city’s nearly deserted 
predawn streets, they twice under- 
went brief surveillance from police 
cars but were not stopped. They 
also had one near-brush with a 
small group of rough-looking 
youths, but at the last moment the 
others avoided open confrontation. 

In the grayness before sunrise the 
slidewalks brought them to the 
edge of a green strip of parkland 
that George said ran continuously 
along the city’s lakefront. Streets 
and buildings behind them now, 
George led the way into the park, 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



139 




across a wide, grassy athletic field, 
now otherwise deserted. Art 
thought he could smell the lake 
nearby, fresh dampness without the 
tang of ocean salt, and billows of 
morning fog drifted into their faces 
as they trudged toward the east. 
The fog made vague green mounds 
out of stands of trees, and limited 
visibility drastically in all direc- 
tions. 

“Looks like nobody’s following 
us,” George muttered, after he had 
glanced over his shoulder several 
times. Traffic on the street they had 
just left was so light as to be practi- 
cally non-existent, and at the 
moment nothing was moving there. 
The ghosts of fog stalked in from 
the lake to cut them off from the 
city behind, and when he looked to 
the east Art could not see nothing 
but fog. Now in that direction he 
could hear a couple of distant 
radios or recorders blaring out pop 
music. 

“We should see some people 
soon,” George told him in a low 
voice. “There are always fishermen. 
She won’t just be sitting out here 
utterly isolated.” 

“1 was wondering.” He kept 
wondering too if she would really 
have the picnic cooler with her. Ac- 
cording to George the code message 
had indicated that she would. Rose 
had carried her own fetus 
home — or somewhere — but that 
had been under emergency condi- 
tions. Maybe illegal parturition was 
always an emergency situation. 
Maybe normal birth and life were, 
too. 

Out of the thick fog there loomed 
abruptly athwart their path a chest- 
high wall of massive stones, looking 



at first sight like part of some 
ancient fortification. Art realized in 
a moment that just beyond this 
rampart was the lake. They came 
up to the seawall and stopped. Four 
or five more tiers of the gigantic 
blocks made a rough stair going 
down to the water, where waves 
materialized out of fog to lap 
against their base. It was impos- 
sible to see out over the water for 
more than a few meters. 

“This chaste fog,” George 
muttered. He checked his watch. 
“She’s supposed to be waiting right 
around here somewhere. Look, 
we'd better separate. You go south 
and I’ll go north, along the rocks. 
If you -find her, give a whistle. If 
you need help, yell out good and 
loud and keep on yelling, I’ll be 
there as fast as I can.” 

“How far south do I go?” 
George considered. “I’d say half 
a kilometer or less and you’ll come 
to a harbor where a lot of private 
boats are tied up. Some fishermen 
will be around there too.” The 
radio music was coming from that 
direction. “If you don’t find her 
between here and the harbor, 
better turn and come back this 
way. I’ll go north about the same 
distance and come back. If we can’t 
find her we’ll meet again about 
here.” 

“Right.” 

F red and Wolf came out of the 
park to stand beside the seawall 
amid the drifting billows of fog. 
There they paused uncertainly. At 
the moment there was no thin 
blond girl carrying a container — 
or anyone else — in sight. 

Fred wished he had been able to 



140 



GALAXY 




find Lewandowski, too, but there 
was no use wishing. He said: “This 
must be the place. I guess we better 
split up. How about if you go that 
way and I go this?" 

“All right.” Wolf and his neck- 
piece showed their double grin. 
“Watch out, man. They say there’s 
a lot of apes hang out in these 
parks.” 

Fred laughed nervously, and 
with a tentative wave of his hand set 
off toward the south, walking 
parallel to the seawall. Wolf 
watched him go. Almost at once he 
was swallowed by the fog. 

Wolf set out at a deliberate pace 
in the opposite direction. Despite 
having been up all night, he felt 
alert and cheerful. It was fun to 
have something interesting to do 
with his time, fun to help out a pal, 
and there might be some money at 
the end of it. He didn’t know what 
the whole thing was all about, 
except it had something to do with 
illegal midwifing, but he didn’t 
really care. 

He knew the moment he saw the 
girl that she was the one they were 
looking for. She was a few meters 
inland from the seawall, waiting 
amid some carelessly stacked 
stones left over from its construc- 
tion. Thin and blond, and doing 
nothing but waiting, she was sitting 
on the lowest tier of one of the 
stacks of stone where she was pretty 
well sheltered from view. And there 
was what he had been told to look 
for — a container of some kind, 
which turned out to be a white- 
handled red picnic cooler. 

Her head swung around sharply 
when she heard the tiny scrape of 
his sandal on the stone he had 



mounted in order to see down into 
her sheltered spot, and at the sight 
of him she gave a little cry and 
started to get up. She was wearing a 
translucent skirt and open Cretan 
bodice. 

Wolf grinned his knowledge at 
her and came hopping down the 
stair of stone to where she was. 
Conscious of being menacing, he 
w atched her face, enjoying the little 
series of masks she was trying on, 
masks of unconcern, of welcome, of 
defiance, trying to hide the fear in- 
side and keep him off. 

He came right up to the girl and 
reached out. but not for her. He 
pul his hand instead on the handle 
of the cooler. Maybe she would be 
smart and simply let him take it 
and walk away. But no, when he 
turned around she jumped at him 
silently from behind, and he smiled 
a little because he had been half 
expecting it. 

But the attack on his face and 
head was too fierce for him to go on 
smiling. He had to drop the cooler 
and use both hands to shove her 
off. She went down on the grass 
with a little cry of pain. “Wait!" 
she called down. "Wait, can’t we 
talk about this?" 

Wolf could feel the blood trick- 
ling down his face from where her 
m>ils had raked him. He sighed. 
This was business, and Fred hadn’t 
passed along any instructions that 
the woman w'as to be beaten up. 
People w ho hired this kind of busi- 
ness done usually spelled out just 
what they w'anted, no more, no less. 
Anyway, Wolf had gotten all the 
urge to hurt people out of his 
system during the night. He shook 
his head, mocking and chiding.

“Lady, lady. You know this thing 
don’t belong to you anyway.” He 
picked up the cooler again, notic- 
ing its unusual weight. And cold. 
Well, he wasn't being paid to be 
curious. 

She got up, pulling her bodice to- 
gether, hiding her breasts provoca- 
tively. “Please,” she called, first 
quietly, then louder. “Please, it « 
mine. Isn’t there something you 
want more?” 

Wolt gave a tiny laugh and 
turned, shaking his head. She 
wasn't bad, but this was hardly the 
time or place. He started off again, 
the heavy cooler pulling at his arm. 

To his utter amazement, she 
jumped him from behind again, 
this time screaming as she landed. 
This time the attack almost 
brought him down because it was 
so unexpected. He dropped the 
picnic cooler on the grass again, 
once more fended off the clawing 
fingers from his eyes, and twisted 
around to get a good grip on the 
girl's arms. Without much diffi- 
culty he avoided her clumsy at- 
tempt to knee him in the balls. This 
time he gave her a violent shake or 
two before he let her fly. This time 
she went down harder and lay there 
sobbing. “Lady, you’re pushin’ 
your luck.” 

Then there was the sound of 
running feet approaching. A little 
guy carrying a fishing pole and 
tackle box dashed out of the fog 
and into the little arena among the 
stones, where he came to a sudden 
stop. A short guy with blond hair 
and goatee who looked enough like 
the girl to be her brother. Wolf had 
fifteen kilos on him easily. He 
picked up the cooler once rtiore and 



took a step in the way he wanted to 
go, scowling, but the little guy only 
threw down his fishing gear and 
took a step to stay in front of him. 

“Hey, it’s a quin-tup-let,” Wolf 
said easily. “And this one must be 
the runt of the litter.” Now here 
came another pair of running feet, 
and he reached into an inner 
pocket for his knife, but it was all 
right after all, it was just going to 
be a little extra fun, for it was Loh- 
mann who came charging up. 

Lohmann slid to a stop, though, 
with a look on his face so sick that 
Wolf had very rarely seen the like 
before. “George, Rita,” said Loh- 
mann, staring at the other two 
people there, and speaking in this 
low', sick voice. “Oh purity. Oh 
chastity no.” 

“George,” said the girl in a low, 
fainting voice. “It’s my baby. Stop 
him.” 

Wolf snarled and held out the 
knife to make sure little George 
stayed w here he was, and here he 
came anyway with a skip and a 
dart. Wolf, good with the knife, 
aimed at the oncoming flat belly. 
The body before him twisted away, 
though, going down very low, and 
Wolf never saw the upthrusting 
back-kick coming, only felt his 
breath driven out of him and his 
heart stop momentarily as the kick 
smashed into his ribs and broke 
them inward. And then he felt his 
knee with his weight on it break 
sideways from some terrible im- 
pact, with blinding pain, and then 
he felt a jolt that went all through 
his head and tore part of the world 
away and came again and again 
like a long echo, until the world was 
gone.

Art Rodney, puffing and lumber- 
ing toward the sounds, saw 
Fred backing out of the arena 
among the huge stones. 

“George, I didn’t know,” Fred 
was saying. “George, I swear.” 
And then Fred turned and ran, just 
ran flat out, almost knocking Art 
down in his passage. Art could still 
hear the long strides pounding 
when Fred had vanished into the 
fog. 

Advancing again. Art took in the 
scene with a glance. Knife on the 
grass, man on the grass, George 
looming over him, looking down 
and rubbing his knuckles auto- 
matically. White-handled red pic- 
nic cooler on its side, Rita sitting 
near it, sitting awkwardly and in 
pain. 

“Oh, darling, easy,” she said 
into his ear. “Don't squeeze me. 
Oh Art, you didn’t bring the police 
down on us, did you? The doctor 
said you wanted me still.” 

“Oh, yes, yes, yes I want you. 
Never mind about all the rest of it. 
Let’s get you home." 

“My baby.” She was pointing at 
the cooler and he went to set it right 
side up, as if that could make any 
difference to what was encapsu- 
lated inside. Then he looked over at 
George, who was prodding the 
fallen figure with a toe. “What 
happened?” Art asked. “1 got here 
as fast as I could when I heard a 
commotion. 1 thought I just saw 
Ann’s brother Fred run past me 
just now.” 

“It was.” George shook his head 
and seemed to rouse himself. “Let’s 
get out of here.” 

“And who's that?” Art moved a 
little closer to look at the man on 



the ground. The man's eyes were 
open, blankly, above what looked 
like a fur collar of some sort. His 
face was scratched and marked 
with trickles of fresh blood. “Will 
he be all right if we just leave him?” 

“He’ll be dead,” said George, in 
a voice that wavered once and came 
back strong again. “He’s dead 
right now. Let’s get going.” And he 
moved and picked up the cooler 
with one strong hand and helped 
Rita to her feet with the other. 
“Art. get our fishpoles and stuff.” 

“Oh. Oh, chastity.” Art looked 
once more at the dead man and 
pulled his eyes away. Somehow he 
picked up all the fishing gear that 
he and George had carried here 
and dropped, and then went on 
after his wife and her brother into 
the fog. When he caught up, he de- 
manded: “Rita, did that fellow 
back there hurt you?” 

“No, no, only pushed me down. 
And my bottom is still sore from 
the parturition, and I have cramps, 
but the doctor didn’t have to make 
any incisions. 1 can walk, but I'm 
so tired I don’t know how far.” 
Now she was clinging to Art’s arm 
while George walked a little ahead 
of them carrying the cooler. They 
moved through the fog toward the 
sound of Orlando’s voice on several 
radios. 

“Art, George, if anything 
happens to me, this is the situation. 
He's on the waiting list for a womb, 
but it may be months. The doctor 
says the safest place for him in the 
meantime is the Loyola School of 
Medicine, cryogenics lab. They 
seem (o have some safe depository. 

1 don’t know where. Loyola's on the 
north side of the city. Art. Ask for

Gwen or Larry. I said we'd get him 
there. The doctor said he was 
afraid he had to flee the city right 
away or be arrested. Maybe there 
are worse things than that for us to 
fear. That man back there was no 
policeman, but he was after my 
baby, not after me." 

Art felt a pang. Rizzo. He patted 
his wife, hugged her, murmured 
soothing words. 

“I tell you he was. He would have 
taken this basket and walked away 
if George hadn’t stopped him.” 

Art, head throbbing sickly now, 
stared at George’s back, moving 
three paces ahead of him through 
the mist. Over his shoulder George 
said: “We'll deliver him where you 
said. Sis. Hey, what’s his name?” 
Art stared at the red cooler, seeing 
instead the dead body they had left 
behind them on the grass. He and 
George both. 

"I haven’t talked that over with 
his Daddy yet. 1 think George 
Arthur. Or maybe Arthur George, 
though Art used to say he didn’t 
want a junior.” 

They came abruptly to a little 
rise, and at its top encountered the 
seawall again. Almost below them, 
amid thinning drifts of fog, several 
long piers extended at right angles 
to the shore. The piers were edged 
in plaees with moored pleasure 
boats ‘and elsewhere occupied by 
fisherfolk with their poles and nets 
and buckets. The sun was up now, 
turning fiercely white above the 
watery horizon, visible between 
great lake-borne mounds of the 
dissipating fog. 

Here a road of recycled plastic 
gravel ran just inland from the sea- 
wall. A few fishermen's cars were 



parked along its edge. As the three 
of them reached the road, they 
simultaneously saw a police car 
cruising in the middle distance, a 
face turned out of its wdndow in 
their direction. In unison they 
altered course, and there was 
another car approaching along the 
road where it bent inland. 

“Split up," said George suc- 
cinctly. He thrust the picnic cooler 
into Art’s hands and with the same 
movement took back his own old 
tackle box. “Rita, take the bait 
jug," he added, and in the next in- 
stant was gone, sprinting toward 
the. south. Now both police cars 
were accelerating, but the trio on 
which they had been closing in were 
gone three ways at once. 

G eorge went around a clump 
of bushes, and back onto the 
seawall, where he dashed past a 
group of fishermen. Then he 
slowed to a trot, and then to a 
quick walk. He looked back fre- 
quently, and cursed. Obviously 
neither of the cars had come after 
him, though fie was staying near 
the road to lure them on. But now' 
at last there came a uniformed 
policeman in pursuit of him on 
foot. 

“You there, halt!" 

George was purposely deaf to the 
first yell, figuring they would give 
at least one more before they 
started shooting. If they were 
serious enough to shoot, which they 
probably w eren’t as yet because the 
dead man could hardly have been 
found and reported to them so 
soon. 

He heeded the second, closer 
shout, and looked around with 



144 



GALAXY 




polite surprise as an athletic police- 
man of dark brown skin came 
running up. 

“All right, hands in the air.” 

“What’s the matter, officer?” He 
set the tackle box down and put his 
foot on it and raised his hands. 

He was patted down for 
weapons. “What’ve you got in 
there?" 

“Show me a search warrant and 
you can search me completely.” 

"I'm conducting a weapons 
search, mister, get your foot off 
(hat thing before I shoot it off.” 

George got, moving two steps 
away and keeping his hands up. 
The policeman peered into the box 
and then looked at him expression- 
lessly. “All right, come along. 
Bring this box of junk if you want 
it." 

The officer sheathed his pistol 
and took a good grip on George's 
right sleeve just above the elbow' 
with his left hand. With this grip he 
w alked George north again. It must 
be a technique they taught at the 
police academy, how to be ready to 
subdue resistance by the suspect. 
The grip was not bullying, and yet 
quite firm enough for business. Not 
bad for an amateur, not bad. 

Fishermen stared at them as they 
passed. Now only one police car 
was in sight, parked, with a scatter- 
ing of the curious observing it from 
a little distance. Rita sat alone and 
composed in the back seat while a 
man in civvies sat twisted around to 
face her from the front. 

“Do you know this man?” 

Her eyes turned neutrally to 
George, waiting for a signal. 

“Of course she knows me. I’m 
her brother.” 



"George, this gentleman says 
he’s Detective Simmons.” 

“What were you running off 
with, George? Empty tackle box, 
maybe? Don’t you know' it’s against 
the law the interfere with police 
carrying out their duties?” 

It wasn’t really empty, but too 
close to empty to be convincing to a 
fisherman. George held it under his 
arm and remained silent. The man 
sighed and informed him that he 
was under arrest for conspiracy to 
violate the Population Control 
laws, and made the little speech de- 
tailing his constitutional rights. 

With George and a patrolman in 
the back, and another uniformed 
man up front with Detective 
Simmons, the car began to move, 
cruising slowly north, going off the 
plastic road and over grass, follow- 
ing the lakefront. Then they turned 
and cruised the other way again, 
and stopped and let out one of the 
uniformed men. w'ho stood looking 
over the piers with quick twistings 
of his head, then walked away, 
talking on a wrist-radio. 

The man in civvies turned once 
more. “We’re bringing along your 
tackle box and your empty bait- 
bucket, George and Rita, to show 
the judge what kind of tricks you 
try to pull. We’re also going to 
bring that red picnic cooler and the 
fat man who’s carrying it. We’re 
going to pick that up in a minute. 
Why don’t you tell me something 
about it now, just to show you’re 
willing to cooperate? Where were 
you taking it?” 

“My sister and 1 want to see an 
attorney before we answer any more 
questions at all. This sounds like 
something serious.” 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL

“What do you think something 
serious is, George? What were you 
two and your sister’s husband 
doing here today? No reason you 
can't tell me, if it wasn’t anything 
wrong.” 

“Let us talk to an attorney,” Rita 
said. “And then we’ll answer ques- 
tions.” 

A message w as coming in on the 
car radio. DOA found on the rocks 
near South Shore Beach. Police 
number-jargon followed. The two 
policemen still with the car ex- 
changed looks but did no more. 
George held his hands down so that 
the callus pads might not be seen. 
Sooner or later somebody might 
make the connection. At the 
moment he felt no guilt or fear; at 
the moment he was still steady as a 
rock. Attorney, attorney, where will 
I find you? He had a couple of them 
among his students, but none in 
criminal law . 

Another radio message was 
coming, this one on Simmons’ 
wrist-radio. From the back seat 
George couldn’t quite make the 
message out, but abruptly the car 
was rolling again. It accelerated 
strongly, turned on its siren for a 
blast or two, then almost at once 
screeched rocking to a halt. 
“That’s Hall,” Simmons in the 
front seat said, opening his door 
and getting out. 



O ut of a small crowd a lean, 
stooped man was coming 
toward them, plodding with slow 
weariness as if he waded through 
mud; that was not pure figure-of- 
speech, George saw, for the man 



w as wet as if he had just fallen into 
the lake. From the business socks 
inside his sandals a little puddle 
sloshed out at every step, and water 
plastered down his thinning hair 
and dripped from his translucent 
shorts and jacket. Simmons 
jumped to meet him, asking excited 
questions. 

“That fat fathering breeder!” 
was all Hall said at first, in a voice 
choked w'ith anger, as he stood 
there trying to press the water out 
of his clothes. “That quintuplet- 
siring crowder!” Some of the on- 
lookers gathered at a little distance 
smiled or giggled at the earnest 
vileness of the man’s speech, while 
one or tw'o appeared sincerely 
shocked. 

Simmons w<as holding his wrist- 
radio ready. “If he shoved you in 
the w’ater I can put in a call and 
charge assault and resisting arrest. 
That’ll get us some more manpower 
out here. Which way did he go?” 

“I don’t know. Anyway, I don’t 
care to press those charges.” It 
seemed that a little strong language 
had served to discharge Hall’s 
anger. He put up a hand as if to 
ward off the detective’s glare and 
exclamations of disgust. “He didn’t 
hurt me. I don’t think he even in- 
tended to knock me in the water, 
just to get away." Hall had taken 
off his jacket and now began to 
wave it like a distress signal, trying 
to dry it in the morning breeze. "I 
called out to him, when I saw that I 
had him cornered on a moored 
boat, I said just hand over the 
specimen and save yourself a lot of 
trouble. You and your wife and ’ie 
whole world will be better ofi, I 
said. But then he came off the boat 



146 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 




with this picnic cooler under his 
arm like a football. Just put down 
his head and charged, and he must 
weigh ninety kilos . 

Hall had looked at Rita several 
times, but had offered her no re- 
cognition until now. “Well, Mrs. 
Rodney, 1 suppose you and your 
husband and brother here are 
getting yourselves a lawyer. From 
the way you sit there looking so 
serenely into space, 1 suppose too 
that you’ve heard about the 
report.” 

Rita, chin high, was studying the 
horizon. George asked: “Report?” 

“The new population forecast 
from the UN. The one we’ve all 
been afraid of. A real surprise. If 
the latest trends continue, world 
population is going to reach a peak 
of around ten billion in the next 
forty years and then start down, 
maybe even a rather sharp decline. 
Not that that will help the people 
who are going to go hungry in the 
next forty years, of course, but it’s 
going to make it a little harder to 
convict people like yourselves 
before a jury.” Mr. Hall was now 
standing nude and shivering 
slightly in the dawn, wringing out 
his shorts, his dripping codpiece 
slung over one shoulder. 

“World population’s going 
down?” said the detective, sound- 
ing rather dumb. He couldn’t seem 
to grasp it right away. George 
couldn’t either. 

Hall said: “Oh, we all knew it 
had to happen someday, one way or 
another. The only question was 
how and when. Still, when it does 
happen, we feel surprise.” 

Simmons was busy with his 
radio. George asked: “But what is 



it? The Homo Leagues? 1 know 
they’re growing fast.” 

“They were allowed for in pre- 
vious forecasts. No, the thing that 
tipped the balance, that wasn’t 
foreseen, was all this religious celi- 
bacy. Half a dozen religions boom- 
ing today, young people pulling 
themselves out of the reproductive 
pool by the tens of millions. People 
will think it will ease the population 
pressure right away, though of 
course it won’t. It was hard enough 
before to get convictions, with 
bleeding-heart lawyers and frozen 
fetuses to cloud the issue. Now this. 
But we’re going to try, sir, we’re 
going to try. I’ll see you in court, 
whether we manage to recover the 
specimen or not.” 

George, riding north along the 
Outer Drive in the back of the 
police car, going to some police sta- 
tion where they would have to let 
him see a lawyer before he said a 
sublimatin’ thing, held his sister’s 
hand and looked out over the lake. 
The waves were coming in stronger 
now with a freshening breeze, 
starting to crest into whitecaps near 
the shore. The fog had gone. Get 
through. Art, get through. Loyola 
School of Medicine, cryogenics lab, 
ask for Gwen or Larry. I’ve killed a 
man to save that kid, and you’d 
better not lose him now. I’d kill any 
other son of a bitch who tried to kill 
my nephew. 

He smiled a little for the new 
man born so strangely into the 
world, and at the same time he was 
very worried. The waves came in 
from the clear horizon, cresting 
into white. The crest of the wave 
has been reached. And now, to see 
which way the world slides down.'#

M. A. BARTTER 



H ell is underground. 

Five minutes ago they’d never 
seen each other. Two minutes ago 
(he little blonde had been clutching 
Karmela lor dear life. Now she 
tacked unsteadily down the subter- 
ranean hall in the grip of a husky 
matron. Karmela let throat-tight- 
ening sympathy distract her own 
churning fear as she followed them, 
jostled and crowded by other 
women. Someone was chivvying 
them from the rear — surely no one 
was that anxious to serve the City. 

Cindy looks like a rowboat 
hustled by a powerful tug. 

Trinity! W liv'd I think that? I've 
never seen the ocean. Must have 
been some travelogue: York, 

maybe, or Socal. Somewhere big 
and dangerous and frightening. 

HOLY TRINITY PROTECT ME 
DUTY DONE IS THE CITY WON 
SELF MUST SACRIFICE TO THE 
NEEDS OF ALL 

I CAN DO ALL THINGS IN THEM 
THAT STRENGTHEN ME 
THERE IS NOTHING TO FEAR BUT 
FEAR ITSELF 

Ever since she'd received Notifi- 
cation — less than an hour ago — 
slogans had become Karmela’s only 
coherent consciousness. Then, on 
the elevator, Cindy’s trembling 
arms had gone around her waist, 
and the reassurance she’d auto- 
matically given had steadied the 
other. But still she burned with re- 
sentment: snatched from job, 

family, comfort, sequestered with 



thirty-nine others, forced into un- 
natural servitude to involuntary 
compliance — and she couldn’t even 
bear it alone, she had to spend her- 
self comforting that weak snit of a 
girl. 

/ always collect the weepers. 
Every time / turn around someone’s 
using mv shoulder. 

The corridor, patchily lit, 
stretched close and green and 
strangling. Another sign like the 
one in the elevator, flashing im- 
peratively: REJECT PERVERSION. In 
the elevator car it made sense, 
where mixed contact was both close 
and unavoidable, but why here? 
Karmela decided someone must 
have a sick sense of humor. 

Around a bend in the tunnel: 

DUTY DONE IS THE CITY WON. 

Well, at least that makes sense. 

The matron lumbered off, 
leaving Cindy bonelessly trembling 
in the doorway of a stifling locker 
room. She sagged toward Karmela, 
goldpiled hair catching in the silver 
filagree at Karmela’s throat. 

Swearing under her breath, Kar- 
mela carefully untangled them. She 
would be wearing her good bola to- 
day, her lucky piece. She laughed, 
shortly, bitterly; the room stifled 
sound. 

There isn't enough air down here 
to go around. 

Echoingly garbled instructions 
blatted from a loudspeaker; Kar- 
mela held her breath, straining to 
hear. It stopped, and everyone 
gasped and shuttled; someone 
sobbed and choked. 



149 




Karmela still gripped her bola. 
Slowly she pulled it over her head, 
caressing the satiny stone with her 
thumb. 

If they lose this . 

Anger gave her strength; she 
joined the line for a basket, still 
hiding it in her fist. Sweat poured 
down her face, between her breasts, 
ran chill over the. flatness of her 
stomach to dampen her crotch. She 
felt isolated in the crowd, bearing 
alone the whole burden of 
Contract. Someone would take over 
her job, and she's spend a whole 
month trying to straighten out the 
mess, as she always had to after 
vacation. She glanced toward 
Cindy, motioned her to join the 
line; it looked as if she’d spend the 
whole Service time taking care of 
her. As if she didn’t have enough to 
put up with. 

Always something, she thought 
resentfully. If she couldn’t rely on 
Celia at home, she’d never have 
been able to keep their troy, the 
most difficult yet most rewarding 
family group. Mari didn’t have 
what it takes. Celia was their 
strength, but she, Karmela, was 
the lubricant that kept them func- 
tioning smoothly. 

Will they miss me? 

Cindy was still sagging beside the 
bench when Karmela returned and 
set her basket on it. Roughly she 
pushed the girl toward the line. 

“Get a basket, Cindy!” 

The vague blue eyes snapped into 
focus, and big tears spilled over in- 
visibly fair lashes. 

“Basket? What for? Oh, Kar- 
mela, I’m so scared!” 

“Basket for your clothes." 
Soothingly, appealing to childish 



pride: “You don’t want to lose that 
pretty dress.” 

Cindy moved off. Karmela 
rubbed her bola nervously. Having 
it no longer strengthened her; she 
wondered desperately how to keep 
il safe. The mesh of the basket was 
too wide to hide it. Finally she 
pushed it into one of her roughout 
desert boots and stuffed her panties 
over it, then neatly folded her 
ruffled shirt and tailored navy slax 
on top, latched the cover, and re- 
turned to the line to have it locked, 
thumbprinted, and stored. 

Wish / didn’t know how often 
nice things turn up missing. 

The line moved sluggishly past 
the lockers, into another corridor. 
Stillness was heavy; occasional 
bitter comments were subdued, 
pounded down by the air and the 
stink of fear. Sudden shrieks spun 
them all around; still clothed, 
Cindy struggled with the matron 
who had pulled her off the elevator. 
Furiously Karmela broke out of 
line and strode back.' 

“C’mon, honey,” the matron 
chattered, “c’mon, honey.” Her 
voice was loud, mechanical; she 
knew Cindy wasn’t listening, but it 
didn't matter. She could enforce 
compliance. “You know the Con- 
tract.” 

“Why me? Why? 1 don’t want to! 
I won’t!” 

“I'll take care of her!” Karmela 
drew Cindy’s hot, swollen face 
against her breasts. 

“You know the Contract binds 
all Cities; we can’t violate it for 
personal preference.” the matron 
said defensively, taking the clothes 
Karmela stripped off Cindy and 
folding them deftly into a basket. 



150 



GALAXY 




“Preference!” Karmela made the 
word a curse. "You know that in- 
sisting on biological function dis- 
criminates against us.” 

"Population quotas limit the 
others, and they call that discrim- 
ination, too.” 

"We have to fill the quota, and 
they have to limit. ‘Keep order and 
maintain the population,”’ Kar- 
mela quoted. 

"They didn’t think we could 
maintain ourselves, but we do!” 
The matron's heavy cheeks flushed 
patchily. “Praise the Perfect Troy!” 

“So we do," Karmela said 
bitterly, joining the end of the line 
with Cindy once again clutching 
her. “We even keep our elderly, 
instead of sending them to Havens; 
we take in immigrant converts. 
And thank God w'e still get them; 
otherwise I’d have been down here 
long before this, and often.” She 
was talking to herself; Cindy had 
withdrawn again into a shocked 
daze. “Look at the men, poor 
things, the ones that can have to 
Serve over and over; too many are 
nonfunctional. Look up, Cindy! 
We women have always been bio- 
logically superior.” She gave the 
girl a little shake and an encour- 
aging grin. 

“I wish 1 hadn’t worn my bola to- 
day.” What subject would capture 
Cindy’s attention? “They don’t very 
often lose things, but if anything 
gets lost. I’ll bet that'll be it. It was 
the first really perfect cab I ever 
cut.” 

“1 noticed it,” Cindy hiccupped. 
“Did you really make it yourself?” 

“Did it all myself: found the 
rough, slabbed it, shaped and 
polished it, too. Bought the find- 



ing, of course, but I’m pretty proud 
of the whole thing. It’s fortifica- 
tion-agate, and I got the design 
balanced and the polish is flawless, 
and it fits the bezel perfectly. You 
should have seen how many cabs I 
ruined before that one, though!” 
"It’s simply lovely. I wish I could 
do something like that.” Cindy’s 
voice had steadied, Karmela 
noticed. So had hers. And the child 
was standing on her own two feet 
for a change. Karmela slipped her 
arm protectively around the slender 
waist. 

“My troymate’s a rockhound; I 
picked it up from her. At first I 
didn’t think it w'ould be much fun, 
hours on the desert hunting well- 
disguised rocks and days slicing 
them up and working them, but it 
is. Even hard w ork’s fun, when you 
get something like that out of it.” 
“You’re in a troy?” Cindy’s tone 
was worshipful. “Gee!” 

"Three years.” 

“I’m in a crowd. But I only left 
school six months ago." 

“They Notified you young, 
then.” 

“Well, at least I won’t have to 
worry about it any more." 

“True. I’ve been sweating out 
Notice for years; it will be sort of a 
relief to have it over.” 

They were half-shouting over 
squawks of protest and the solid 
roar of water. 

“I hate showers,” Cindy squeal- 
ed. “They could at least ask if we’re 
clean or not.” 

“They assume the worst.” 

T he shower was pleasantly 
warm, and breathtakingly, 
punishingly powerful. Karmela

staggered through and was blown 
dry. A matron measured her with 
an expert eye. produced and 
smoothly fitted a binder before 
Karmela realized what she was 
doing. The heavy cloth strapped 
her arms above the elbow, crossed 
under her breasts and fastened 
snugly in back; she could, with 
difficulty, touch her chin. She 
glanced back at Cindy. 

What a bra that makes! 

Cindy stared back at her, flush- 
ing. and warmth flooded Karmela. 
Slowly the younger girl approached 
and offered her hand; closecoupled 
they walked the few yards to join 
the others, milling about a large 
room .

green wall blinked, be ye perfect. 

DUTY DONE IS THE CITY WON. 

“Will we be here long?” 

“Two weeks, at least,” Karmela 
snapped. Then, more calmly, she 
went on, “Don’t be afraid. They 
take good care of us.” 

“I suppose so.” 

“1 know they do. 1 work here.” 

“You work down here?" 

“No, silly, upstairs in Hospital. I 
keep records. I know all about it; 
after all, where do you think we’ll 
be, nine months from now? It’s a 
natural process. Almost no one 
dies.” 

"1 know that. What I meant was, 
are they going to make us wait 
long? I hate waiting.” 

Chairs clustered in comfortable 
groups, but no one sat down. They 
all felt the need to move about, to 
demonstrate, for a short while, 
their independence. 

Defiantly Karmela stalked to the 
largest, most deeply cushioned 



chair and dropped into it. No on< 
would see how badly her nerve 
were jumping. 

“What are we waiting for?' 
Cindy persisted, perching on th 
chair arm. 

“Who knows?” 

"Trinity keep us, I don’t think 
can stand much more of this,’ 
another woman gasped, slippin; 
into the chair next to them. 

“Maybe they’re going to give us ; 
pep talk." Karmela guessed. 

"More likely they're rounding uj 
the men, poor things,” the womai 
said sadly. “They even recruit fron 
Ambiville, now.” 

Cindy shuddered and sagged to- 
ward Karmela. Foiled by the 
binder in her instinctive warding 
gesture, Karmela sank a shoulder 
into the pliant ribs. 

“Sit up and behave yourself! 
Why not use ambis? All of this is 
unnatural. Who cares how low we 
stoop? As long as it gets the job 
done." 

“That’s the way to look at it,” 
the woman said steadily. “And 
some of the ambis were normal, 
once. I know one or two the City 
destroyed, right here.” 

"How could that happen?” 
Cindy gasped. 

“They check your reactions, 
afterwards,” the woman replied, 
nodding dourly at the sign that 
flashed reject perversion. 
“Down here, that’s good advice.”

Karmela’s disgust and anger.

ambis, or worse. The City protected 
itself by rejection of such unassimil- 
able trash, of course — but she’d 
never dreamed that fulfilling Con- 
tract could cause perversion! 

Not her! Others, perhaps, but 
not her! Not strong, cool, compe- 
tent Karmela! Seeking comfort, she 
rested her flushed cheek against 
Cindy's cool flesh even as the girl 
leaned forward, intent on the other 
woman's casual words. 

“That’s why all the admoni- 
tions?” 

“The whole City is undergoing a 
religious revival. Well, perhaps 
that isn’t the word; our tradition 
wasn't ever religious. Not like some 
Cities, that were founded on fanati- 
cism. I think myself we’re afraid 
this third generation is losing the 
spirit of the Founders. They knew' 
all about hardship and persecution. 
They were jailed, fined, fired, os- 
tracized; we have it easy. Why, 
breeding is the only difficult thing 
the City ever demands of us. We 
don’t even have to endure the 
dangerous, crow'ded conditions of 
the Old Cities. Our population 
stays level, we have a good balance 
of trade, good education, good nu- 
trition, artistic opportunities, the 
whole Good Life. So of course 
Complex is afraid we may go soft, 
especially toward Perversion. 
Nothing could destroy the City as 
last as that! And if a good crusade 
is the answer, I’m all for it.” 

“Oh, you must be in Complex!”

Cindy, she decided. The child 
didn’t know any better. 

Karmela followed a matron into 
a cubicle and hitched herself onto 
the Y-shaped table. 

“Lie down, dearie.” 

“I know what to do.” 

The matron’s speech was set, a 
reply went unnoticed. “It’s no 
different from a physical, dearie. 
Just relax." 

“Oh. yeah?” 

Someone's crying. Maybe it's 
me. 

“Put your legs up, dearie. Head 
down. Just let me fasten the straps; 
that’s a good girl, safe and snug. 
Hold real still, now, this won’t hurt 
a bit. Just a neutral bath, make 
everything nice for the little visitor, 
and a good greasing up to help it 
along.” 

Ugh. 

The polarizing mask snapped 
over her head; she looked up darkly 
as the man entered. His mask, 
oriented ninety degrees from hers, 
made a black hole of his face. 

At least he's young. Good wide 
shoulders, not too hairy, stomach 
under control and omigod he's big. 

He surged against her, bound 
arms frictioning her spread thighs 
while the matron adjusted the table 
to attack height.

left; she bit down a wail.

This is frightful. Suppose 1 don't

pretend it now, but this is . too 
real . 

Suppose I do conceive. Nine 
months of grossness and misery . 
but I won't ever have to do this 
again. At least I won't have to take 
care of the brat . I'd be a lousy 
mother. I want back to my own 
computerminal, put my files 
straight, handle bitter complaining 
patients and impatient doctors and 
problems I know I can solve. 

Explosion at last . pumping 
heat, panting, lax, betraying weak- 
ness. She opened her eyes, saw only 
the ubiquitous, smirking matron. 

“Can I get up now? Why not?” 
Angry almost to tears: “Dammit, 
can't they swim uphill?” 

"Why, dearie, did you think that 
was all? One breeding doesn’t de- 
liver a satisfactory statistical 
return. Two a day through your fer- 
tile period, and we guarantee 82% 
conception. Just rest, now, dearie.” 

Karmela shivered with fear, 
more than the abuse or chill. The 
woman looked so knowing, so 
sadistically expectant. Could she be 
an ambi? Was she the one who 
would test her responses, when this 
was over?

DIRECTIONS 



Dear Directions: 

I wish to differentiate and 
analyze some of the many com- 
ments made by Poul Anderson in 
the August 1974 article titled “A 
Cyclical Theory of Science Fic- 
tion.” I do not agree with Anderson 
that the “new wave never existed.” 
Because an author can’t tell the 
difference between one thing and 
another doesn’t mean that “it never 
existed.” This is inane (even 
though I do agree with Anderson 
on other points). Many who wish to 
theorize over the new wave have 
labeled it anything from “plotlessly 
precise mechanical trash,” to the 
change, or if you will, acceleration 
in science fiction as an entirely new 
concept in reading. As a matter of 
fact, Anderson himself stated 
approximately one year ago as 
saying that the new wave was “an 
introduction to the more advanced 
mainstream techniques.” At that 
concept, one suspects that one 
dozen authors ended up on his 
back screaming the new wave was 
again something else. One conclu- 
sionally thinks that it’s just as ludi- 
crous to label “new wave sf,” as it is 
“sf” itself (even though I agree with 
Heinlein that sf is ‘realistic 



fiction’). Is it not as easy to label 
science fiction and fantasy “specu- 
lative fiction?” Hell knows you 
can’t say it never existed.

Dear Mr. Baen: 

I’ve read a lot about John W. 
Campbell in the past, and Frederik 
Pohl, and others, but as of a few 
months ago 1 decided you belong 
right on up there with them. So far. 

Dick Geis and Jerry Pournelle 
are fantastic. The stories are fan- 
tastic. Ted Sturgeon and Lester del 
Rey are fantastic. The Showcase is 
a nice addition. Anything left out is 
fantastic. And when the magazine 
is fantastic so is the editor. 

I’ve read the letters that say how 
awful science fiction has become 
and to a certain extent 1 agree. But 
I do know that Galaxy and IF are 
the two best magazines on the 
market. 

As to that “so far” I put in the 
first paragraph, that’s just to 
remind you to keep on working 
hard. But somehow 1 feel you don’t 
need to be reminded. 

Oh, one more thing: I’d like to 
encourage everybody to subscribe 
to Locus. I’m sending in my sub- 
scription as soon as I finish this 
letter. 

Yours devoutly, 
John Kelly

This letter is directed to Jerry 
Pournelle' s column “Our Friends 
the Arabs ” in the August issue. 
Jerry's reply follows the letter.

Dear Mr. Baen: 

Regarding the article “A Step 
Farther Out,” by Jerry Pournelle. 

Mr. Pournelle covered the energy 
situations well, and his article was 
very interesting, but while he men- 
tions it in passing, he and all other 
knowledgable people in this field 
keep overlooking the most obvious 
source, except in a casual way, and 
one that we have right now and 
have had for a number of years. 
That’s solar panels, not in space, 
but right here on earth. 

1 am not an engineer and my 
terminology may be wrong, but 1 
am talking about the little silicon 
wafers that are arranged in banks 
and change direct sunlight into 
electrical energy. The Bell Tele- 
phone Company has been using 
them for years in rural areas where 
electricity was not available. 

A few thousand acres of desert 
land in Southwest Arizona, as an 
example, could supply half of the 
country with power with absolutely 
no pollution. The only problem I 
know of is that of storage, since 
these panels would only produce 
power while the sun’s rays are strik- 
ing them. If the technology doesn’t 
exist at present to store vast 
amounts of electrical energy, then I 
suggest a concentrated effort of our 
engineers and scientists to produce 
a means of storage. Think of it, the 
vast wastelands of the Earth, pro- 
ducing all the power needs of the 
complete Earth, without a single 
generator, nuclear power plant, use 
of coal and oil, all free, except for 
the building of solar panels and the 
means of storage of that power. 
And as for “depleting” our source, 
as in oil and coal, how long is our 



sun going to last? 

Sincerely, 
Ed Woods 
Box 209

Dear Mr. Woods, 

Jim Baen of Galaxy has been 
kind enough to forward your letter. 

At the Mexico City meeting of 
the AAAS last year, there was a 
panel and presentation on direct 
solar energy, and I have some data 
on the system. If you are interested, 
by the way, the Congressman from 
Arizona inserts most articles on the 
subject into the Congressional 
Record, a good place to go for pre- 
liminary research on practically 
anything; the Extensions of 
Remarks usually reprint the best 
news articles from all magazines 
(along with an extraordinary 
amount of gubbage). 

There are two problems: at the 
moment, there’s not enough for a 
full article on the subject, as it’s an 
incomplete story — a Arizona Uni- 
versity project seems to expect a 
breakthrough pretty soon, though, 
and when that happens Galaxy will 
be among the first to know. 

Secondly, you’ve put your finger 
on one of the biggest problems, 
namely storage. I discussed this 
briefly in one of my articles. The 
most efficient storage system we 
have at the moment is pumped 
reservoir storage, and the Sierra 
Club, among others frowns on 
these. Batteries are impractical. 
Using sunlight to electrolyse 
hydrogen is another possibility, but 
this requires both sunlight and lots 
of water in the same location — and 
the latter commodity is hard to 



156 



GALAXY 




come by in deserts where cloud 
cover is not a problem. 

An electricity supply must be re- 
liable, meaning that the net as a 
whole must be; a lot of unreliable 
sources together can add up to a re- 
liable one, but you need predicta- 
bility, or else a very rapid substi- 
tution cycling time, else come 
disasters. 

The efficiency of present day 
solar panels is rather low. There are 
improvements expected; also, 
methods for using diffuse sunlight, 
that is, methods that would work 
on a cloudy day, are also in the 
works. 

We’ll have a report on all of this 
when there’s a bit more to report; 
also, perhaps we’ve worked the 
energy crisis for about as much ma- 
terial as it deserves just now. 

By the way, one of the final prob- 
lems — not unique to solar direct 
energy, but certainly a major one 
for it — is transmission of energy. A 
lot gets lost sending it over long 
distances. 

In other words, it’s the total 
system efficiency that counts, and 
of course economic factors are 
crucial as well. 

One of these days, though, I 
make no doubt we’ll make more 
use of solar energy collected on the 
ground. 

Thanks for your letter, and I 
hope you continue to like the 
column. 

Sincerely, 
Jerry Pournelle 

Dear Jim, 

Several months ago, T-K 
Graphics ran a full-page ad in 
Galaxy , and one of the orders re- 



ceived was from Mr. Charles 
Hillestad, who paid for a copy of 
SF: Today and Tomorrow. In the 
course of our normal order pro- 
cessing, orders, checks and enve- 
lopes are separated. Mr. Hillestad’s 
order did not contain his address, 
but by the time we noticed this his 
envelope had been thrown out and 
his check deposited, so we had no 
way of finding it. And there has 
been no subsequent inquiry or com- 
plaint. This, then, seems our only 
method of reaching the gentleman. 
Will Mr. Hillestad please send us 
his address so that we can send him 
the book we owe him. 

I hope you can manage to find 
space for this in Directions. Thank 
you for your kindness. 

Sincerely, 
Ted Pauls, for 
T-K GRAPHICS 

Dear Mr. Baen: 

My story. If Ever I Should Leave 
You, was published in the February 
1974 issue of IF. But the version of 
my story which appeared there had 
been massively edited and re- 
written. I feel 1 must protest 
against such treatment. The editing 
done on it, in almost every case in 
which I compared it to the original 
story, was to its detriment. 

I realize that you were not the 
editor of the magazine when this 
occurred, but w’riters must object 
publicly when such editing is done 
without their knowledge and 
consent. A writer’s name is his or 
her slock in trade. If 1 am to stand 
or I'a 1 1 by what is published under 
that name, let it be by my own 
words and not those of a nameless 
collaborator. I must therefore dis-

associate myself from this story as it 
was published in IF. 

Thank you for giving me the 
opportunity to state my grievance 
in print. 

Very truly yours, 
Pamela Sargent 
Box 586 

Johnson City, New York 13790 
Ms. Sargent has the right of it. 
Dear Galaxy: 

In a letter, I somewhat “over- 
dramatized” a piece of fiction en- 
titled Come Times' Arrow which, at 
that time, was a spaceship infested 
opera, bearing a marked resemb- 
lance to a NASA Tech Brief, and 
expressed a desire to submit it to 
you for a “look-see.” I was pre- 
paring the nth draft, blundering 
through page after page, wondering 
if I would ever finish, and really 
hoping there was more to deep- 
space exploration than free radicals 
and interstellar grains when I re- 
ceived my copy of the June 1974 
Galaxy. 

The idea that the future is 
synonymous with the present is not 
a new one, but I have never seen it 
presented in such exciting terms as 
those given by Alexei and Cory 
Panshin in Farewell to Yesterday's 
Tomorrow. Many editors have 
written blurbs such as “this is 'now' 
science-fiction” to accompany 
stories; the latest being a drug- 
oriented pinball soap opera, loosely 
based on THE WHO'S shatterock 
experience Tommy, in one of your 
competitors. But, stories such as 
this, although clearly identifying 
themselves as being “different,” 
tend to produce the proverbial 



“bull in the china-shop” syndrome, 
when presented with material that 
cannot quite complement their 
action. In a word, synergy. 

I think this is what Alexei has in 
mind when he discusses the “new” 
sf magazine in his letter to Direc- 
tions, Galaxy July 1974. Although 
he confines his statements to the 
“physical” package for the most 
part, he does indicate the need for 
“internal” change as well. Again 
we have combined action. The ob- 
vious question is: What type of sf 
will this new era produce? On page 
nine of the Forum article the Pan- 
shins’ write, “This universe will be 
the ideal reflection of the new 
multiplex Earth we are now 
awakening to.” 1 have underlined 
what 1 consider to be the key words 
of this passage. Will mankind see 
his own past, present (and future?) 
reflections in other faces on other 
worlds? Will sf become more 
cerebral? Certainly, both are dis- 
tinct possibilities, but I would sub- 
stitute the word probing for 
cerebral. And what of this term, 
multiplex? This is given in the form 
of synergy , ecology, and evolution. 

I personally feel that these three 
“Panshin Multiples” will become 
the by-words of the new era, the 
blueprints for tomorrow, if you 
will. 1 also feel that the new sf will, 
if you will pardon the expression, 
come “down-to-earth” in reflective 
qualities, of course. 

Continued success with your new 
look, and thanks for a really great 
article. 

Respectfully, 
Jeffrey T. Davis

SINCE the writings of Jules Verne and 
H. G. Weils, science fiction— often 
termed “future fiction”— has fasci- 
nated alert minds. Not only has it 
entertained, it has predicted much of 
the far-ranging scientific and social 
change now upon us. 

In GALAXY, the finest authors of 
the genre continue to speculate, to 
predict, to tackle the prime problems 
already shaping tomorrow. Ecology- 
space exploration— nuclear promise 
and threat— energy— social evolution 
and biological revolution— these and 
other fields are probed by imaginative 
stories uniquely exciting and reward- 
ing. So let your fancy run free. Sub-
