A RE the tales of strange human pow- 
ers false? Can the mysterious feats 
erformed by the mystics of the Orient 
e explained away as only illusions? Is 
there an intangible bond with the uni- 
verse beyond which draws mankind 
on? Does a mighty Cosmic intelligence 
from the reaches of space ebb and flow 
through the deep recesses of the mind, 
forming a river of wisdom which can 
carry men and women to the heights 
of personal achievement? 

Have You Had These 
Experiences? 

. that unmistakable feeling that you 
have taken the wrong course of action, 
that you have violated some inner, un- 
expressed, better judgement? The sud- 
den realization that the silent whisper- 
ings of self are cautioning you to keep 
your own counsel— not to speak words 
on the tip of your tongue in the pres- 
ence of another. That something which 
pushes you forward when you hesitate, 
or restrains you when you are apt to 
make a wrong move. 



These urges are the subtle influence 
which when understood and directed 
has made thousands of men and women 
masters of their lives. There IS a source 
of intelligence within you as natural as 
your senses of sight and hearing, and 
more dependable, which you are NOT 
using now! Challenge this statement! 
Dare the Rosicrucians to reveal the 
functions of this Cosmic mind and its 
great possibilities to you.

REACTIONS 



J UST about the safest bet you 
can make is that almost any- 
thing that has gone out of style 
will come back into style, that, at 
least on the political scene, 
friends will become enemies and 
enemies . friends, and the like. 
Newton’s Third Law of Motion, 
in other words. I have not now 
nor have I ever read Hegel and 
Marx, but I had, God wot, more 
than enough gab about “thesis, 
antithesis, synthesis” brayed at 
me as dialectics, when action, re- 
action and rest were meant. 

You know what? I miss those 
verbal storm centers. I wouldn’t 
if people were not playing things 
cool, no sweat, and other such 
terms for mental cyclone cellars. 
Right, left, middle and way the 
devil off in Cuckoo Land, the at- 
tackers, defenders and straddlers 
of the barricades in the living 
rooms cared. I would put “cared” 
in italics except that every rem- 
iniscer who has found his present 
lacking did so, clear back to 
Cato, and you know what he said. 



Besides, that’s not the point here; 
I admire many of George Jessel’s 
ex-wives — oh, ten or twenty, not 
all, I want it clearly understood 
— and I have no ambition to fit 
the comment one of them made: 
“Georgie has been reminiscing 
since he was six years old.” My 
anecdotage, to quote somebody 
else, is, or feels, a good way off. 

My point is beards and I ap- 
pear to be trying to make it the 
hard way. 

Beards were the cat’s whiskers 
in the 19th century, and yet no 
President, from Washington to 
Grant, stumped the country with- 
out a razor. Lincoln? It was not 
until he was elected and sending 
out change-of-address notices that 
he sprouted. A little girl named 
Grace Bedell of Westfield, N. Y., 
had written him that she thought 
he would look better with 
whiskers. So he tried it, and by 
the hair of the Prophet, she was 
right! 

In the next half century, all 
but two Presidents were beavers

— Andrew Johnson (would he 
have come so close to impeach- 
ment if he’d been bearded?) and 
William McKinley (and did 
that figure in his assassination?) 

— and a skimpy three mustaches, 
Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt 
and Taft. Since then, not even 
five o’clock shadow has darkened 
the faces of our Chief Executives. 

Hair grew wild in those days. 
The assumption was that the 
male of the species, as with other 
critters, had to do his attracting 
with masculine appurtenances. 
(The females attracted right 
back, but this would be of note 
only if they either suddenly 
started or stopped.) 

A man could just let his crop 
grow from the time he was a 
shaver, of course, with never a 
pruning, but such types were rare. 
In beardhood’s full flowering, 
there were goatees, mutton chops, 
sideburns, and on and on and on, 
culminating, at least to my view, 
in the astonishing adornment 
worn by Horace Greeley, a fringe 
from lobe to lobe, not one whisker 
daring to raise its head above the 
jaw line. Now that was an age 
when a stylist could make other 
people’s — and his own, more 
than likely — hair stand on end, 
or lie flat, or twist with wax, or 
any of the seemingly thousands 
of combinations with bristles be- 
low mouth and nose, and involv- 



ing those items and eyes, ears 
and chin — a real landscaping 
job. 

Now this is not an argument 
for or against beards. I am simply 
observing that the beard is re- 
turning; all countries have their 
Beat Generation, and the beard 
is the commonest denominator, 
so that Beardnik would perhaps 
be a closer-cropped term, instead 
of Beatnik and Teddy boys. 

Like all first-generation growth, 
whether it be furze or forest or 
fuzz, today’s beards are primeval. 
I know there are women who 
want to run their fingers through 
the things — wonderfully, there 
are women who want to run their 
fingers through anythingness or 
nothingness — but these are 
merely the shaggy forerunners of 
what may become a handsome 
and varied facial lawn, complete 
with hedges, windrows and ter- 
racings, and heaven knows what 
else, for styles in beards are sure 
to be as different and unpredict- 
able as those in clothes and 
modes of transportation and any- 
thing else you might care to 
name. 

Now we run into the seeming 
wall of attitude. Ignore it. 

Attitude has never yet kept a 
style from happening or unhap- 
pening. To those men and women 
who would rather be caught dead 
than have or be married to a 



6 



GALAXY 



beard, for reasons seldom ex- 
pressed in twenty-five words or 
less, I offer the assurance that 
when everybody else has or is 
married to one, the lack thereof 
would overrule all present ob- 
jections. 

One genius, trying to determine 
the very bravest act in the whole 
history of mankind, decided it 
was the first swallow of the first 
oyster. 

My compliments to the man 
for a thorough sifting of history, 
and my apologies for cock-hat- 
ting his notion. My money says 
it was a kid. Kids love to be the 
first on their block, a desire and 
aim coldly exploited by the pur- 
veyors of the dried bread crumbs 
known as breakfast cereal. Papa 
may not want to be caught dead 
with a beard. Mama may share 
the feeling, though this is ques- 
tionable when beards are becom- 
ing the fashion. But neither is 
proof against Junior’s urging, 
cajoling, and, when nothing else 
works, accusations that this shows 
they don’t love him. 

Status — along with relationship 
and basis — is a workhorse word 
that ought to be allowed to rest 
up, but yes, status was very much 
involved in a man’s ability to 
grow a beard and have some- 
thing fresh and appealing done 
with it, and it can be again if a 
trend to the beard leads to all 



that was involved in every 
bearded era: male authority, the 
autocrat of the breakfast (and 
dinner) table the defender of 
honor, name and family. The 
sword and dueling pistol were the 
weapons of previous times; law- 
suits and business ruin, public ex- 
posure to being outdone, all that 
sort of updated rivalry, make fine 
substitutes for antlers. But up- 
dated antlers can also be. 

All this from non-conformist 
conformity in beard-growing? Ex- 
cept for the leaders, who always 
are a year or two ahead, non-con- 
formity has been and is and can 
be expected to be conformity 
among the led. There lies the seed 
of the beard. 

A number of reactions, heard 
round the world, strengthen the 
odds against beardlessness. Pro- 
gressive education and permissive 
child-rearing are very heavily 
under fire, and female domina- 
tion is also getting its lumps — 
more from women than men — 
and what, barring some unlovely 
exceptions, distinguishes the sexes 
more than the ability to grow a 
beard? 

In other words, action has 
caused reaction. Like all reac- 
tions, it can be counted on to go 
too far. In what direction? Here’s 
one educated guess — right from 
Barber’s College.

The Wrong World 

By j. t. McIntosh 

Say "Oops, sorry” to a planet that has been 
conquered by mistake? No, find a diplomatic 
formula — meaning justify conquest — or else! 

Illustrated by FINLAY 



C ONSOLIDATION Officer 
Breeli couldn’t have had 
a better first impression of 
the newly conquered world. The 
sun was shining brilliantly as he 
stepped from the ship, and the 
richness of this planet called Earth 
dazzled him. 

Even the clouds, white and 
fleecy in an otherwise blue sky, 
were beautiful. Breeli had never 
seen beautiful clouds before. The 
landscape, rolling in gentle swells 
and curves to a shimmering gold 
and blue horizon, was a dream in 
green and brown. 



Earth was quite a planet. 

It was a pity that the Terrans 
were only at the Fifteenth Level. 
This wasn’t a world to conquer, a 
world to ravage, a world to keep in 
subjection. This was a world to 
welcome cordially as a full mem- 
ber of the Pastan Federation. 

However, only members of hu- 
man races which had reached the 
Eighteenth or Nineteenth Levels 
were eligible for full membership 
of the Federation, and according 
to the last survey . 

Breeli’s reflections were dis- 
turbed as his gaze fell on two na-

tive men painting a fence across 
the spaceport. Their white over- 
alls didn’t reveal much of their 
physical contours, but enough to 
indicate that the Terrans were a 
hundred per cent human, though 
the males were broader and 
heavier than Pastan men. 

What interrupted Breeli’s train 
of thought wasn’t the mere sight 
of the two natives, however, but 
the way they were working. They 
seemed to be doing the job quick- 
ly, sensibly and efficiently, and 
without supervision. Their over- 
alls, too, weren’t of Pastan design, 
yet at that distance they looked 
well designed and serviceable. 

Breeli could have sworn he was 
looking at two members of an 
Eighteenth Level race. 

HP HAT was impossible, of course. 

General Prani would never 
have gone ahead with the total 
conquest plans if the Terrans had 
turned out to be Eighteenth Level. 
Anyway, the last survey had been 
made only a few thousand years 
before, and the Terrans had then 
been unquestionably Fifteenth 
Level, having just learned the 
uses of metals. They were prob- 
ably Sixteenth Level now, but no 
higher. 

“There’s a car waiting for you, 
sir,” said the lieutenant at Breeli’s 
elbow. “I’m to drive you to Gen- 
eral Prani’s headquarters.” 

Breeli didn’t allow his pleasure 



at the first sight of Earth to lure 
him into familiarity. Consolidation 
Officers held rank equivalent to 
field marshals, and since they 
were, in effect, civilians arriving 
after the shooting was over to take 
matters out of the hands of the 
military, they were never exact- 
ly popular with them. Scrupulous 
formality was best. 

“Thank you. Lieutenant,” he 
said. 

“And this is your shield, sir,” 
said the lieutenant, holding out a 
plastic belt with four small black 
discs on it. 

Breeli raised his eyebrows. “I 
thought this world was supposed 
to be conquered.” 

“Depends what you mean by 
conquered, sir. There’s no military 
resistance any more. But we all 
wear shields.” 

The standard equipment de- 
fense shield radiated around its 
wearer a force field which in or- 
dinary circumstances remained 
completely quiescent. But if 
enough energy was generated 
within it quickly enough, the field 
became a miniature hyperspace 
drive. A bullet entering the field, 
for example, was rapidly shunted 
into hyperspace, its own impetus 
supplying the necessary power. 

Men wearing shields could be 
strangled or stabbed, but they 
couldn’t be shot, and an explosion 
wouldn’t harm them, unless it was 
violent enough and big enough 



10 



GALAXY 



to swamp the field and topple 
shield, wearer and blast into hy- 
perspace. Shields even afforded 
protection against too enthusias- 
tic knife-thrusts. If you wanted to 
kill a man wearing a shield, you 
had to insert your knife into a 
convenient vital spot and press it 
home gently but firmly. And it 
was no use trying to hit him on 
the head with a blunt instrument. 

But Breeli always felt uncom- 
fortable when he wore one. “Put it 
away, Lieutenant,” he said. “I’ll 
take my chances.” 

“General Prani’s orders, sir,” the 
lieutenant persisted. “All Pastan 
personnel must wear shields at all 
times.” 

“I imagine my orders overrule 
General Prani’s,” Breeli remarked. 
“Where’s the car, Lieutenant?” 
The lieutenant wasn’t enjoying 
himself, but he stood firm. “I can’t 
drive you to headquarters if you 
don’t have a shield, sir.” 

Lieutenants just didn’t dictate 
to Consolidation Officers. But 
Breeli knew in his heart the lieu- 
tenant was right. Instead of mak- 
ing an issue of it — he could have 
had him arrested on the spot — 
Breeli meekly accepted the belt, 
swallowed hard and buckled it on. 

"D REELI stared at the car when 
they came to it. It was long, 
black and shiny, with a lot of 
glittering chromium. He wanted 
to ask the lieutenant who had built 



a car like that, and why, but 
restrained himself. No doubt 
somebody had made it to impress 
the natives. 

The greatest shock came when 
the car turned smoothly onto a 
six-lane highway. Breeli was 
stunned. This roadway couldn’t 
have been constructed by the oc- 
cupying forces in the time at their 
disposal. Besides, why would they 
want a six-lane motorway? Ob- 
viously, therefore, it had been 
there before they came. 

The Terrans had made it. 

The implications were shatter- 
ing. A Seventeenth Level race 
could have made such a road, con- 
ceivably even a Sixteenth Level 
race under intelligent supervision. 
But only an Eighteenth Level civi- 
lization would have any use for 
such a trafficway. 

It was suddenly clear that the 
car he was in was of Terran origin, 
made for the highway on which it 
was running with such effortless 
ease, speed and comfort. 

“Lieutenant,” he said, controll- 
ing his voice with an effort, “these 
Terrans are Eighteenth Level.” 

“Yes, sir,” said the lieutenant. 
“Perhaps Nineteenth.” 

“Then why—” Breeli began, and 
checked himself abruptly. Better 
to see Prani first. 

An error of catastrophic pro- 
portions had been made. General 
Prani, sent to conquer Earth, had 
attacked and subdued an Eight- 



THE WRONG WORLD 



11 



eenth — possibly Nineteenth — 
Level culture. 

It was a ghastly blunder. When 
you moved in on a world peopled 
by apes, what the apes thought 
about it didn’t matter very much. 
Even a Fifteenth Level race could 
be shoveled aside without much 
compunction — not exterminated, 
of course, for all races had a right 
to develop. A race at the Seven- 
teenth Level, curiously enough, 
invariably welcomed conquest. 
They fought hard and savagely, 
but they respected conquest and 
learned rapidly from their con- 
querors. Conquest was good for 
them. 

An Eighteenth Level race, how- 
ever, had a great respect for the 
value of human life and liberty. 
It had a delicately balanced econ- 
omy which could easily be ruined. 
It had a highly developed social 
structure. Most of all, it had pride 
and a strong sense of its own im- 
portance. 

Moral issues aside, conquering 
an Eighteenth Level civilization 
didn’t pay. It wasn’t good for the 
conquerors or conquered. 

But moral issues couldn’t be 
kept aside. A capital crime had 
been committed. 

Heads would roll for this. 

r P HE car slowed slightly to turn 
off the motorway. There had 
been no other vehicles on it, and 
the only living creatures to be 



seen had been Pastan guards on 
foot, patrolling the grass verges. 
Presumably General Prani had 
commandeered this whole area, 
permitting no Terrans to enter. 

The exit was ingenious. The 
car sped off to the right to turn to 
the left, crossing the motorway by 
a bridge. Silently, Breeli cursed 
General Prani. Hadn’t it been ob- 
vious at a glance that these Ter- 
rans must be wooed, not ravished? 

The very much inferior road on 
which they were now traveling had 
footpaths on each side, and Bree- 
li’s eyes almost popped from his 
head when he had his first glimpse 
of Terran women — three of them, 
on the sidewalk. 

“Stop the car!” he shouted. 
“Those women . .” 

The lieutenant slowed the car 
but didn’t stop. “Sorry, sir,” he 
said. His face was red with em- 
barrassment at having to thwart 
a Consolidation Officer for the 
second time in ten minutes. “Don’t 
you think you’d better see Gen- 
eral Prani first, sir? I mean, you 
don’t know the native language, 
and anyway . I’m very sorry, 
sir.” 

“You have no specific orders to 
stop when I tell you?” Breeli 
asked. 

“No, sir. But . no, sir.” 

“It’s merely your own idea, 
then, not to do what I tell you, and 
make me do what I don’t want 
to do?” 



12 



GALAXY 



“I . yes, sir.” 

“What’s your name?” 

“Lieutenant Wilt, sir,” the driver 
said miserably, knowing he was in 
for trouble. 

Breeli, his first unthinking im- 
pulse to stop and take a closer 
look at the three women thwarted, 
could see excellent reasons why 
he should not do so. As Wilt had 
said, he couldn’t speak the lan- 
guage. Also, he didn’t yet know 
the terms of Earth’s surrender. Per- 
haps there were religious, racial 
and social taboos of which he knew 
nothing. 

Once more Lieutenant Wilt was 
undoubtedly right. 

Wilt was a man to watch, pos- 
sibly a man to have promoted. 
However, there was no need to re- 
assure him just at this moment. 

The car turned into a drive 
flanked by trees and slowed to a 
crawl. So Prani’s headquarters 
still had to be protected by a di- 
verter, Breeli mused. Natural 
enough, if the Terrans really were 
Nineteenth Level. 

The diverter was simply a big 
defense shield with a wider field 
of application. Ships protected by 
it could divert even atomic explo- 
sions into hyperspace. When it 
was used for the defense of a 
town or building, it could be set 
so low that only a shell or bomb- 
blast would cause a reaction vio- 
lent enough to trigger the shield, 
or so high that even a stray dog 



blundering into it would be top- 
pled into hyperspace. 

The fact that the lieutenant 
dropped the car’s speed to about 
ten miles an hour as he ap- 
proached the yellow building 
among the trees indicated that 
General Prani had his diverters 
at very cautious settings. 

T) REELI did not, of course, rec- 
ognize the yellow building as 
a roadhouse, but he was struck 
by its attractive, functional lines. 
The sick feeling which had come 
over him returned as he saw the 
sparkling swimming pool to one 
side of the building. That was 
conclusive. Only a civilized race 
could have the know-how and or- 
ganizing ability to collect and pipe 
water where they wanted it in 
such quantities that a huge open- 
air pool with a circulating system 
was a practical proposition. A 
Seventeenth Level race might col- 
lect and pipe the water, but it 
couldn’t circulate, purify and 
aerate it. 

Prani would be executed. Bree- 
li wouldn’t be held responsible for 
something he had arrived too late 
to prevent, but things wouldn’t 
be exactly comfortable for him 
either. 

Breeli was a little surprised to 
be ushered in by a native ' woman 
who spoke fluent Pastan with a 
tolerable accent. 

“What’s your name?” he asked. 



THE WRONG WORLD 



13 



“Dorothy Green, sir. I am chief 
Terran liaison officer.” 

“Appointed by the Terrans or 
by General Prani?” 

“By mutual agreement, sir.” 

She had a pleasant voice which 
didn’t go with her appearance. Un- 
like the three women Breeli had 
seen on the way, she was frank- 
ly unattractive. She was painfully 
thin, colorless, and though her 
drab brown-gray uniform was neat 
and spotless, it did nothing for her. 

As long as Terran females had 
to be employed at HQ, it was very 
sensible that they should be un- 
attractive enough to prove no dis- 
traction. If those three girls had 
jobs at HQ, Breeli reflected, very 
little paper work would be done. 

“How do I address you?” he 
asked, wondering if this would 
provoke a bitter retort. 

“As you wish,” she said. “Doro- 
thy or Green or both.” 

“Very well,” he said, not com- 
mitting himself. He thought he 
sensed sorrow in this girl, which 
would account for some of her 
drabness. He wondered if it was 
sorrow on account of the Pastans 
or anything they had done. “Don’t 
you ever smile?” 

“Not very often,” she said, not 
smiling. “You’ll find General 
Prani in there, sir.” 

P RANI was middle-aged and 
fat and complacent and had 
the thick, moist lips of a sensual- 



ist. Everything became clear to 
Breeli at first sight of him. 

General Prani wasn’t very 
bright. Somehow, through sheer 
good luck, he had been saved from 
ignominy time and again by the 
ability and intelligence of his sub- 
ordinates. Somehow he had be- 
come a general and had been en- 
trusted with an important mission. 

And, of course, he had bungled 
it. 

“Glad to see you, sir,” said 
Prani. “I think we’ll manage to 
make you comfortable here. The 
native women are quite . shall 
we say cooperative? Yes, this is a 
splendid- world. Modesty apart, I 
think I’ve done a pretty good job, 
sir.” 

The buffoon was actually 
pleased with himself. 

“General,” said Breeli quietly, 
“the Terrans are at the Eighteenth 
Level, I understand.” 

“I haven’t given it much 
thought, sir. Nineteenth, I should 
say. No detailed assessment has 
been made. Modesty apart, not 
every general could conquer a 
Nineteenth Level world.” 

“General, aren’t you aware that 
it’s a serious crime under Federa- 
tion law to interfere with races 
above the Seventeenth Level?” 

“But I was sent to conquer this 
world. Naturally I obeyed my or- 
ders.” 

“You were sent to subjugate a 
Fifteenth or Sixteenth Level 



14 



GALAXY 



world. You found a race at the 
Nineteenth Level. Didn’t it even 
occur to you that your orders no 
longer applied?” 

“Sir,” Prani said stiffly, “I have 
risen to my present position in the 
Pastan Federation Army by doing 
exactly as I was told. It is not 
for me to question the orders of 
men far abler . hum . than 
myself. In this case my orders 
were to conquer Earth. It was 
nothing to me if the Terrans were 
Fifteenth Level, or Nineteenth, or 
any other level. I merely did my 
duty as a soldier in the service of 
the Pastan Federation.” 

“Quite,” said Breeli drily. 
There were two possible ways 
out, neither particularly honest— 
but in interstellar politics, expe- 
diency had to play a large part. If 
the Terran resistance had been 
slight, it might be possible to pre- 
tend there had been no conflict 
at all, merely police action. And 
if sufficient time could be gained 
somehow, it might be possible to 
pretend that the Terrans had been 
at the Seventeenth Level when 
Prani conquered the world, and 
had developed rapidly afterwards, 
owing to contact with the Pastans. 

“Have you seen the native 
women, sir?” Prani asked, mag- 
nanimously forgiving Breeli for 
failing to appreciate him. 

“Some of them.” 

“Do you want one, sir?” 

Breeli restrained himself with 



an effort. Anyone capable of the 
criminal idiocy of attacking a 
Nineteenth Level world was natu- 
rally incapable of seeing that it 
was criminal idiocy. 

“There will be no difficulty 
about that?” he asked. 

“None, sir,” said Prani expan- 
sively. “At first these Terrans bit- 
terly resented what they called 
the rape of their women, but there 
was a sudden reversal of their at- 
titude. I have not, of course, taken 
it upon myself to permit mar- 
riage between Pastans and native 
women, but if you will be guided 
by me, sir, you will give permis- 
sion soon. Many Terran women 
are exceedingly attractive—” 

“Like Dorothy Green?” 

“You’re joking, sir. Certainly 
not like Dorothy Green. Intelli- 
gent girl, useful, but ugly. Modesty 
apart, I am very attractive to 
women, sir, and . but meantime, 
shall I have half a dozen sent 
in for you to choose from?” 

A GAIN a sharp reprimand tee- 
tered on Breeli’s lips. But 
he wanted to know more before 
committing himself. “As you wish.” 
General Prani spoke into the in- 
tercom. When he had finished, 
Breeli said: “I take it Terran re- 
sistance was slight? That’s an ex- 
tremely good thing. We may yet 
manage to get out of this with- 
out—” 

“Slight?” Prani cried, affronted. 



THE WRONG WORLD 



15 



“Sir, this has been the greatest 
campaign in the entire history of 
the Pastan Federation, and, mod- 
esty apart, the greatest victory!” 
Breeli groaned. 

Prani settled himself comfort- 
ably behind his desk and started 
his prepared speech complacent- 
ly. “I’ll begin with a paradox, sir. 
These people are advancing tech- 
nologically at an enormous rate. 
In the last fifteen of their years— 
about ten of ours — they have ad- 
vanced more rapidly than we ever 
did in any fifty years of our his- 
tory. Yet, if we had arrived fifteen 
years ago, we’d never have con- 
quered them at all.” 

“They have been concentrating 
too much on nuclear power?” 
Prani’s jaw dropped. In his as- 
tonishment, he was rude. “Who 
told you?” 

“No one. But I am not unin- 
telligent, General — and this kind 
of thing has happened before.” 
The general was not convinced. 
“I see you deserve your high po- 
sition, sir. You are precisely right. 
Fifteen years ago — I use the local 
measure of time, of course — the 
Terrans’ defenses were largely 
non-nuclear. In the meantime 
they have gone over almost en- 
tirely to nuclear power.” 

“So when you arrived, channel- 
ing all nuclear explosions into hy- 
perspace, they had nothing to fight 
with?” 

Prani wasn’t pleased at the 



brusque interruption. “Frankly, 
sir, it was an unpleasant shock to 
be attacked with atomic weapons 
when we believed this was a Fif- 
teenth Level world. But I pride 
myself on flexible command. Mod- 
esty apart, few generals could have 
changed their plans so rapidly. 
I-” 

“At the moment, I don’t want a 
campaign report, General. You 
fought the Terrans and beat them.” 
The general waved a pudgy 
hand deprecatingly. “/ was in com- 
mand, sir. Despite the fact that I 
had been completely misinformed 
about the people of this world, I 
pressed home the attack without 
fear of consequences, and won a 
great victory for the Pastan Fed- 
eration.” 

“General,” said Breeli drily, 
“consequences have caught up 
with you. But before I say any 
more, what were your losses in 
men and materials?” 

“The Terrans fought with con- 
siderable military skill. Had I not 
myself been resolute—” 

“Yes, General. The losses?” 

“It was, of course, an expensive 
campaign, sir.” 

“Precisely. Let me see the fig- 
ures.” 

“I have them here, sir.” 

He handed Breeli a single sheet 
of paper. 

There was a long silence. Then: 
“You call this victory?” Breeli 
whispered. 



16 



GALAXY 



“I told you it was the greatest 
battle in the entire history of the 
Pastan Federation, sir.” 

“So you did. The Terrans, I 
imagine, suffered similar losses?” 
“Oh, considerably more, sir.” 

r |' HAT was that, then. The catas- 
trophe was even greater than 
Breeli had feared. There was 
nothing for it but to place Prani 
under arrest and have him sent 
back to Pasta for trial. 

Breeli had one last try. Almost 
pleadingly he said: “When you 
found the Terrans far more ad- 
vanced than you had been led to 
expect, didn’t you consider trying 
to form a peaceful alliance with 
them, instead of going ahead with 
plans for conquest?” 

“No, sir,” said Prani bluntly. 
“I was ordered to conquer this 
world. I had no authority to do 
anything else.” 

Breeli sighed. Lieutenant Wilt 
had no authority to stop the Con- 
solidation Officer doing something 
rash — yet Wilt had done so. 
Twice. 

“General, if you were ordered 
to make a surprise attack on Tues- 
day evening and you discovered 
on Tuesday afternoon that the 
enemy had not only heard about 
the attack but were waiting for it 
— would you still attack?” 
“Certainly,” said Prani. 

Breeli sighed again. 

“I gather,” said Prani, “that you 



consider I have acted wrongly in 
this matter?” 

“General Prani, your family will 
find it necessary to change their 
name. Every official who had any- 
thing to do with sending you on 
this mission will be examined for 
latent insanity — and rightly so, 
for most of the blame is theirs. 
You, General, will consider your- 
self-” 

A welcome relief for the 
shocked, incredulous Prani was af- 
forded by the sudden arrival of 
the six Terr an girls he had re- 
quested. They came in boldly and 
arranged themselves against one 
wall of the office, smiling and 
laughing. They were neither in- 
solent nor timid. 

And Breeli would have rated 
each one of them, individually, 
the most beautiful woman he had 
ever seen. 

That they looked exotic was 
hardly surprising. They were 
slightly paler, slightly smaller than 
Pastan women. Their eyes were a 
little larger, set further apart. 
Their legs were longer, their arms 
a little shorter. The contrasts of 
their bodies were more extreme- 
larger busts and hips, smaller 
waists. 

Any one of them would have 
been a sensation in a Pastan street, 
and it would have occurred to no 
one to think of her as alien. 

In dress they varied consider- 
ably. Two wore long skirts, one a 



THE WRONG WORLD 



17 



very short skirt. One wore loose 
slacks, one tight pants, one very 
brief shorts. All wore belts that 
emphasized their small waists, and 
all except one had tight blouses 
or dress tops that plainly showed 
why they had tight blouses. There 
were two blondes, three brunettes, 
one redhead. 

“Do any of them speak Pas- 
tan?” Breeli asked. 

“We all do,” said the redhead. 
She was the one in the shorts. All 
the girls looked as if they had good 
figures, but in her case there was 
no possible doubt about it. Above 
her tiny red shorts she wore a 
white strapless suntop, and as he 
looked at her Breeli felt as he 
hadn’t felt since he left his con- 
cupiscent teens behind him. 

“That’s Margo Day,” said Prani, 
who had already recovered his 
usual complacency. “I’d have 
taken her myself, only I already 
have a woman, and those Terran 
girls are very jealous.” 

“Any of us would consider it an 
honor to meet your requirements, 
Consolidation Officer Breeli,” said 
the redhead, Margo Day. 

Breeli started. “You know me?” 
“And your high position,” she 
said respectfully. “You’re what we 
would call a governor. Please make 
your choice, sire. Satisfaction is 
guaranteed, sire.” 

“What is ‘sire’?” 

“It means father. A very re- 
spectful form of address, sire.” 



T>REELI was no fool and he 
knew irony when he heard it. 
Margo Day was laughing up her 
non-existent sleeve at him. Only a 
fool complains about something 
he can’t prove, however. 

Until this moment he had mere- 
ly been playing along with the 
situation, without any real inten- 
tion of taking a Terran mistress. 
But why not take one? If Terran 
women were as compliant as this, 
nothing he did was going to make 
the position any worse than it was 
already. Indeed, it seemed as if 
the Terrans had fully accepted the 
situation, and in that case the ef- 
fects of General Prani’s colossal 
blunder might not be so bad. 

Every instinct in Breeli but 
one screamed at him to choose 
Margo Day. She headed the group 
in looks, personality and brains. 

The dissenting instinct, how- 
ever, was a very important one. If 
the enemy — and these women 
were the enemy, after what Prani 
had done — wanted him to do 
something, he preferred to do 
something else. 

“What’s your name?” he asked 
the blonde beside Margo. 

“Helen Krauss,” the girl in the 
tight pants said, and Breeli sensed 
with satisfaction that she and Mar- 
go Day and all the others were 
in some way disconcerted. He 
hadn’t been expected to pick 
Helen Krauss. 

“Wait for me outside,” he told 



18 



GALAXY 



Helen Krauss, and turned back to 
Prani. 

The six girls filed out. 

“Tell me,” said Breeli sharply, 
when the door had closed behind 
them, “are these people really 
conquered? Is their resistance 
over?” 

“I would not have given the sig- 
nal for your arrival otherwise,” 
Prani said loftily. 

“You mean there’s no sabotage? 
No assassination? Can I trust that 
woman Helen Krauss with my 
life?” 

“Oh, I wouldn’t suggest that, 
sir,” said Prani. “You’ll have a 
guard, naturally. You have your 
shield. She’ll be searched frequent- 
ly. She mustn’t be given the slight- 
est chance to—” 

“Then there is sabotage? As- 
sassination?” 

“Occasionally, when officers and 
men are careless, sir. But—” 

“Why don’t you stop it by re- 
prisals?” 

“There’s a clause in the sur- 
render terms, sir. They wouldn’t 
sign without it. No reprisals for 
acts by individuals. A conspiracy 
has to be proved. After all, sir, 
we’re the conquerors. For years 
individual rebels will commit 
what subversive acts they can. 
Modesty apart, sir, I consider it 
a triumph to arrange such an early 
armistice. Without that clause 
they’d have gone on fighting un- 
til-” 



“I see.” 

So it was neither a peaceful al- 
liance with the Terrans nor a 
proper conquest. The sooner Breeli 
found out exactly what it was, the 
better. 

“I’m going on a tour of inspec- 
tion of the district,” Breqjy said, 
postponing the question of what to 
do about General Prani. “Can I 
have Lieutenant Wilt as guide?” 

“Who’s Lieutenant Wilt, sir?” 

“He drove me from the space- 
port.” 

“Then he must have gone back 
there, sir. I’ll detail Captain Bar- 
vel.” 

“I’d rather have Lieutenant 
Wilt. Oh, well, never mind.” 

W ILT, as Prani thought, had 
been sent, back to the space- 
port after delivering his impor- 
tant passenger. 

The girl Helen Krauss was wait- 
ing outside. Breeli particularly 
wanted to have her along, being 
sure that he could find out a great 
deal from her — not necessarily 
believing what she said. What she 
talked freely and truthfully about 
would be what the Terrans didn’t 
mind his knowing. When she 
seemed to be lying, or refused to 
answer, or pretended not to know, 
he would have a few lines to in- 
vestigate. 

He had no idea what he was 
going to do. He couldn’t very well 
tell the Terrans the attack on 



THE WRONG WORLD 



19 



them had been a mistake. The con- 
quest of Earth was an accom- 
plished fact, and Breeli could see 
no way of making a tactical with- 
drawal and pretending that ump- 
teen thousand dead Pastans and 
Terrans were still alive. Yet the 
subjection of a Nineteenth Level 
world couldn’t go on. 

It wasn’t a moral question any 
more. It was a political one. The 
moral crime had already been 
committed; now the problem was 
to minimize its effects. Since Earth 
was still struggling under the yoke, 
perhaps the Pastan Army could 
allow itself to be driven from the 
planet, allegedly by a Seventeenth 
Level race' on the threshold of the 
Eighteenth Level. Then, a few 
centuries later, Earth, now an ack- 
nowledged Nineteenth Level civi- 
lization, could be offered peaceful 
affiliation to the Federation. 

That would get around most of 
the awkward points. But too many 
Pastan Army officers and men 
knew that the Terrans were al- 
ready far beyond the Seventeenth 
Level, and when they got home 
the explosive truth would be out. 

No, that wouldn’t work. But 
what would? 

Breeli became aware that Doro- 
thy Green was carefully instruct- 
ing Captain Barvel on the itiner- 
ary to be followed. Although Bree- 
li said nothing, he thought a lot. 
This Terran female seemed to 
have a lot of responsibility, and 



she knew exactly where he was 
going to be all afternoon at any 
moment. Why was she trusted to 
such an extent? 

“Please stick to this route, Cap- 
tan Barvel,” she was saying ear- 
nestly, “or I can’t be responsible 
for what might happen.” 

Breeli took another good look 
at Dorothy Green. She was a 
small, slim, restless, energetic crea- 
ture, with tiny, sharp features and 
short dark hair. Her body was 
stringy and bony, and he couldn’t 
imagine anyone of any race finding 
her desirable. 

It was a pleasure after looking 
at Dorothy Green to watch Helen 
climbing into the car assigned to 
him. He climbed in after her. He 
found it interesting that she re- 
coiled involuntarily at first as his 
hip touched hers, and then leaned 
against him provocatively. 

“What do you think of Dorothy 
Green?” he asked abruptly. 

r T , HE unexpected question baf- 
-*■ fled her, and it was some sec- 
onds before she could think of 
anything to say. “Why, what 
should I think of her?” 

“That’s what I’m asking you,” 
said Breeli. “Do you despise her 
as a traitor?” 

“Her husband is a hostage. She’s 
got to work for you.” 

“I didn’t know there were any 
hostages.” 

“General Prani wouldn’t accept 



20 



GALAXY 



Terran liaison officers unless he 
had hostages.” 

That was sensible of Prani, in 
the circumstances. Although it had 
been criminal idiocy to attack and 
defeat the Terrans, it wouldn’t im- 
prove matters to be so weak and in- 
gratiating that the occupation was 
ineffective. 

Perhaps the fact that Dorothy 
Green’s husband was a hostage ex- 
plained her somber manner. 

“So you have a ceremony of 
marriage?” asked Breeli. 

“Of course,” Helen said, sur- 
prised. 

“Are you married?” 

“Me? No.” 

“Don’t you want to be mar- 
ried?” 

“Every girl does.” 

“Then why aren’t you?” 

“Nobody ever asked me.” 

“And somebody asked Dorothy 
Green?” 

“Yes.” She clearly had no idea 
what he was getting at. 

Apparently Terran men mar- 
ried girls with brains rather than 
beauty. It was logical, but Breeli 
knew of no other race which was 
logical in that particular way. 

If it was true that Terran men 
married women for their intelli- 
gence rather than their looks, that 
might explain why six girls like 
those he had seen in Prani’s office 
had nothing better to do with them- 
selves than become the mistresses 
of Pastan officers. 



Y et Margo Day had seemed in- 
telligent . 

The car was returning to the 
six-lane highway. Captain Barvel 
was in the back with a couple of 
guards. Breeli would have pre- 
ferred to be alone with Helen, but 
recognized the need for guards. He 
was the most important man in 
many light-years. No doubt the 
Terrans, who seemed to know all 
about him, would kill him if they 
could. He remembered Dorothy’s 
earnest warning to Barvel : “Please 
stick to this route, or I can’t be 
responsible for what might hap- 
pen.” 

The car reached the feed-in to 
the motorway. Again it was neces- 
sary to cross the vast trafficway 
by a bridge, since they were going 
in the opposite direction from the 
spaceport. The six lanes looked 
naked without cars flashing along 
them. 

“Where’s all the traffic now?” 
Breeli asked. 

Barvel started to answer, but 
Breeli cut him off. He was inter- 
ested in Helen’s answers, not Bar- 
vel’s. 

“None of us are allowed in this 
area except liaison personnel,” she 
said. 

“How about you and Margo 
and the other girls?” 

“We’re liaison personnel.” 

So the Terrans officially pro- 
vided mistresses for high-ranking 
Pastan officers. 



THE WRONG WORLD 



21 



“How do you feel about us, 
Helen?” 

“Does it matter?” 

“Yes. Do you hate us?” 

S HE struggled to find an answer. 

Apparently she didn’t want to 
say yes, but felt the impossibility 
of saying no. 

“Why are you here with me?” 
Breeli asked pointedly. 

“Because you told me to—” 
“You know what I mean.” 

“It’s an honor . .” Helen said 
without conviction. 

“Nonsense. Margo Day was be- 
ing sarcastic when she said that. 
What are you doing it for? 
Money? Prestige? A chance to 
slip a knife between my ribs?” 
She said nothing, which was 
sensible of her. 

Helen Krauss wasn’t bright for 
a Terran. There was no character, 
no personality, no humor in her 
answers. She was like a beautiful 
robot which made the right 
responses when the right buttons 
were pushed. 

A beautiful robot. Breeli con- 
sidered it seriously for a moment 
Possibly the Terrans were suffi- 
ciently advanced to make lifelike 
robots ... no, that was absurd. 
However, to make absolutely sure, 
he resolved to have Helen Krauss 
X-rayed when they got back. 

Still considering the possibility, 
he was a little too late in noticing 
something which would normally 



have put him on his guard at once. 
The driver had asked Barvel a 
question, Barvel had replied, and 
Helen had said: 

“Say, are we going to Heron- 
ville? Why didn’t you tell me? 
Turn off right here and we’ll save 
fourteen miles.” 

Suppose she were a robot. Prani 
had a Terran mistress too. Sup- 
pose some night, when practically 
every high-ranking Pastan officer 
had a beautiful Terran robot with 
him, a button was pushed and all 
the beautiful robots blew up . 

The car had turned off the 
highway and was traveling more 
slowly along a narrow feed road. 
“Wait a minute,” said Breeli. 
“Didn’t Dorothy Green say—” 
The mine tripped by the car’s 
front wheels exploded under the 
rear left wheel. The car and its 
contents flew in many directions 
in many pieces. Their shields en- 
tirely enveloped in the explosion, 
Barvel, the driver and the two 
guards were victims of blowback 
and disappeared into hyperspace. 
And Helen Krauss had no shield. 

Breeli, farthest from the explo- 
sion, was saved by his shield. But 
he was blown twenty feet in the 
air, and as he approached the 
ground extremely rapidly, the 
shield, faced with the task of 
shunting a world eight thousand 
miles in diameter into hyperspace, 
prudently gave up. 

Breeli landed in a bush and 




22 



GALAXY 



THE WRONG WORLD 



23 



found to his dazed astonishment 
that he was able to scramble out 
of it. He staggered a short distance 
and tripped over something. Look- 
ing down, he felt sick. 

Helen Krauss had been no 
robot. 

"O REELI regained conscious- 
ness in bed. For a few sec- 
onds he lay bringing himself up 
to date, reliving the explosion. 
Then he opened his eyes. 

Lieutenant Wilt was with him, 
young, solid, reassuring. Breeli was 
puzzled. Why Wilt? 

Breeli could hardly guess that 
Prani, distracted and terrified 
after the incident, jolted out of his 
usual state of self-satisfaction, 
hadn’t dared to face Breeli. After 
dredging his mind for someone to 
whom he could delegate the task, 
he had remembered that Breeli 
had asked for Wilt as his driver. 

“What shape am I in?” Breeli 
asked. 

“You’re fine, sir,” Wilt said. 
“Not even concussion. Bruises, of 
course. You’ll be able to walk out 
of here tomorrow.” 

“The others?” 

“All dead or going into hyper- 
space, sir.” 

Wilt was bewildered. He had 
expected a strong reprimand once 
Breeli had seen General Prani, 
and when he’d been called back 
from the spaceport, he had ex- 
pected to get it. Instead he found 



that Consolidation Officer Breeli 
had had a miraculous escape from 
death and that he, Wilt, was ex- 
pected to sit and wait for him to 
regain consciousness. Why he had 
been chosen for this, Wilt couldn’t 
begin to guess. He assumed some 
mistake had been made in the 
transmission of orders. 

Breeli wasn’t thinking about 
Wilt at the moment, nor of his es- 
cape, nor of the people who had 
been with him. He was wonder- 
ing how the explosion had been 
arranged. 

Dorothy Green had sent him on 
the route he had taken, but the al- 
teration in the route had been 
Helen’s. How had that dumb Ter- 
ran blonde fixed things so that 
four Pastan officers and very near- 
ly the Consolidation Officer as 
well had been killed? 

“What are you doing here?” he 
asked abruptly. 

“I don’t know, sir,” said Wilt. 
“I was told to sit with you. I’m 
Lieutenant Wilt, sir, the driver 
who—” 

“I know. You nearly died in 
that car, Wilt. I asked for you as 
driver.” 

“You did, sir?” Wilt was as- 
tonished. 

“Perhaps you wouldn’t have 
died. Perhaps you’d have had the 
sense not to follow that girl’s di- 
rections.” 

“It was her then, sir?” 

“I don’t know. I’m going to find 



24 



GALAXY 



out. Bring Dorothy Green here.” 
“Yes, sir.” He hesitated. “Are 
you . can you handle this affair, 
sir?” 

“If I can’t,” said Breeli, closing 
his eyes, “I’ll have the benefit of 
your wisdom and experience, Lieu- 
tenant.” 

Wilt looked at him doubtfully. 
“Yes, sir.” 

D OROTHY Green was white- 
faced but resolute. “I gave 
your driver a route entirely on 
roads which are constantly 
guarded,” she said. “He should 
have known not to turn off them 
at any point, for any reason.” 
“But you’re not heartbroken 
that four Pastan officers died.” 
“Governor Breeli, I—” 

“If I cut a hole in you,” Breeli 
said thoughtfully, “would you 
bleed?” 

“Naturally.” 

“We’ll try it and see.” 

She went even whiter. But her 
voice was steady. “Governor, your 
people so far have at least been 
just. You know I couldn’t have 
been directly concerned in the at- 
tempt on your life.” 

“Not directly — but indirectly?” 
“In no way. Most of the roads 
in this country are mined. I know 
that. Your men know that. Ask 
anyone. Ask the lieutenant here. 
Anyone who turned off the high- 
way was a fool. 1 couldn’t have 
made him do it even if I wanted 



to. If I had given your driver a 
route involving side roads, I’d 
have been questioned at once.” 

“Give me your hand.” 

She did so, wonderingly. He 
grasped her thin wrist. Her heart 
was beating rapidly but strongly. 
It was inconceivable that she was 
anything but a human female. He 
would have to abandon the robot 
idea. 

“You can go,” he said. Then, 
when she was relieved and off her 
guard, he asked: “Do you still 
love your husband, Dorothy?” 

She recoiled from him. “Until 
you said that,” she whispered, “I 
thought you were quite human, 
Governor.” 

Breeli was at a loss. “I’m not 
threatening to have him killed. I 
merely asked if you love him.” 

“The answer is yes, I do.” And 
for the first time he saw fierce 
warmth in her brown eyes as she 
stared back defiantly at him. Her 
fierceness couldn’t make her pret- 
ty — but it could, and did, make 
her suddenly intensely alive. 

“Where is he?” Breeli asked. 

“At an internment camp a hun- 
dred miles from here. I see him 
every Sunday.” 

“You could visit him oftener 
than that if you like. Shall I ar- 
range it?” 

“It wouldn’t be any good,” she 
said, the fierceness fading. 

She puzzled him. No doubt the 
separation from the man she loved 



THE WRONG WORLD 



25 



explained her unhappiness. But 
in his experience intelligent, ef- 
ficient, energetic people usually 
managed to get what they wanted, 
even if they didn’t have beauty to 
help them. Surely, if all she wanted 
was to be with her husband, she 
could get out of serving as a 
liaison officer and have him re- 
stored to her. 

“When were you married?” he 
asked. 

“Six years ago, when I was 
twenty.” 

“Were you pretty then?” 

“No more than I am now.” 

“It doesn’t bother you, not be- 
ing pretty?” 

“I’m quite happy the way I am.” 

He made a gesture, and she 
went. 

“Is it true that most of the roads 
are mined?” Breeli asked Wilt. 

“Yes, sir. Your driver was very 
careless.” 

“Well, he paid for it.” 

Wilt looked at him curiously. 
This Consolidation Officer re- 
vealed a humanity rare in the lieu- 
tenant’s experience of high-rank- 
ing officers. 

TMT ARGO Day sauntered in. 

She had changed her al- 
ready scanty costume for an even 
scantier one. Now she wore white 
striped shorts and a completely— 
and deliberately— inadequate black 
halter. Lying in bed, Breeli sud- 
denly felt uncomfortably warm. 



“Do you always dress like 
that?” he asked. 

“No, sire,” she said, “but I 
thought that if I gave you a bet- 
ter look at the merchandise, I 
might make a sale.” 

“And if it doesn’t?” 

“Maybe I should have played 
hard to get. Shall I go and put on 
a long black cloak instead?” 

“You mean you want to take 
Helen’s place? You think I’d be 
fool enough to let another Terran 
girl try to kill me?” 

“Well, that’s the snag,” Margo 
said frankly. “That’s why I have 
to use good salesmanship.” 

She was actually admitting that 
she was prepared to be his mis- 
tress just for a chance to kill him. 
‘Were you in on the plan?” 
“No, that must have been 
Helen’s and nobody else’s.” 

“How do you think she man- 
aged it?” 

“Oh, she was just lucky there 
was a mine there, and unlucky 
that she was killed and you 
weren’t. Still, it was a good bar- 
gain — her life for four Pastans.” 
“Your attitude seems different 
from what it was earlier.” 

“How? I said it would be an 
honor to be your mistress. Which, 
in this crazy situation, it is. It 
would be an even greater honor j 
to kill you, sire.” 

“Dorothy Green’s been trying 
hard to convince me she wouldn’t 
kill me.” 



“She’s different. Her husband is 
a hostage. Anyway, she’s a rene- 
gade. If you don’t stay in control, 
she’ll get half a dozen bullets in 
the guts anyway. I’m not a rene- 
gade. I’ve got nothing to fear from 
my own people.” 

“Despite collaboration?” 

“What collaboration? Every- 
body knows I’ll stick a knife in 
your back if I get the chance.” 
Her honesty was startling. Yet 
everything she said made sense. 
Conquerors on a human planet 
umpteen light-years from their 
own had to have women, even 
women who would kill them if 
they could. 

“Suppose you gave me your 
word not to make any attempt on 
my life?” 

“Suppose anything you like. 
You’d be stupid to take my word, 
sire.” 

“Would you give it?” 

She laughed. “This is a very 
theoretical conversation, isn’t it? 
Sure, I’ll promise not to try to 
kill you. I’ve already told you that 
I’ll do it if I get the chance. That 
makes me a liar anyway.” 

“I think I’ll take you up on your 
offer, all the same.” 

“That’s great, sire. Want me to 
get into bed with you now?” 

Wilt choked. 

“No. I’ll send for you when I 
want you.” 

“Mean you want me to go?” 
“Yes.” 



VV/'HEN the door had closed 
” behind her, Breeli said 
thoughtfully: “Have you got an 
Earth girl, Wilt? 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Doesn’t it bother you to know 
she’d stick a knife in you if she 
could?” 

“She wouldn’t, sir. Not Nancy.” 
“Don’t be too sure, Lieutenant. 
These people seem to have a re- 
markable passion for freedom.” 
“Yes, sir. ‘Give me liberty or 
give me death.’ A Terran saying, 
sir.” 

“Said by a man or a woman?” 
Wilt looked surprised. “A man, 
sir. Terran society isn’t a matri- 
archy.” 

“No? That makes the present 
situation very hard to under- 
stand.” 

“Sir?” 

“Never mind. It looks as if the 
attempt on my life and the deaths 
of my guards will have to be 
passed off as a regrettable acci- 
dent. Wilt, was the war really 
savage?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Yet you don’t think your little 
friend would kill you?” 

“I’m sure of it. She — she loves 
me, sir.” 

“Why?” 

“Sir?” 

“Why? Is she pretty?” 

“Yes, sir. Very.” 

“How does that make sense, 
Wilt? Earth’s far beyond the stage

of respecting conquerors. Why do 
their most beautiful women throw 
themselves at our heads? Outside 
of fiction, girls like Margo Day 
don’t have to be heroines. They 
can leave that to plain girls. Why, 
Wilt, why?” 

“I don’t quite understand, sir.” 
“Well, think about it, Lieu- 
tenant. Meanwhile, bring me some 
publications to read. Terran pub- 
lications, with pictures.” 

“Yes, sir. Some came in, today.” 
“I want old ones too. Publica- 
tions printed before the occupa- 
tion.” 

“There aren’t any, sir.” 

“Then find some.” 

“I mean there are none left, sir. 
They’ve all been destroyed.” 
“Get some from a waste dis- 
posal organization.” 

“You still don’t understand, sir. 
A lot of us wanted to see old Ter- 
ran publications, to get some kind 
of picture of what Earth was like 
before we came. But we’ve never 
been able to find any. The Ter- 
rans have destroyed them all.” 
“Deliberately, so that we can’t 
see them?” 

“It would appear so, sir.” 

“That’s strange,” Breeli mused. 
“What would there be in publica- 
tions that they wouldn’t want us 
to see?” 

“We don’t know, sir. We’ve 
often wondered.” 

“Yet current publications are 
freely available?” 



“Yes, sir.” 

“All right, Lieutenant, bring me ! 
some.” 

T> REELI was left with his | 
thoughts. There were many 
things about which he was puz- i 
zled. But very soon he would I 
have to take some sort of action. I 
The present situation couldn’t I 
be allowed to continue, that was J 
certain. The Pastan Federation • 
would never ratify any solution 
to the Earth problem based on a 
military occupation of a Nine- I 
teenth Level world. Already Bree- 
li had once been on the point of 
ordering Prani to consider him- ] 
self under arrest. 

Yet how could he go to the 
Terran leaders, whoever and 
wherever they were, and say : “I’m I 
sorry General Prani conquered : 
Earth. It was a stupid mistake. 
Now can we please be friends?” 
He might say: “The Pastan 
Federation is just. We will with- 
draw under certain conditions,” 
and give them all they asked. But 
the Terrans were intelligent 
enough to realize that that came 
to the same thing. 

Damn General Prani! 

Breeli glanced moodily through [ 
the publications that Wilt had 
brought. Unable to understand a ■ 
single word of the text, all he 
could do was look at the pictures. I 
There were newspapers, books, | 
technical journals, women’s maga-

zines, weeklies and monthlies de- 
voted to current events, fashion, 
sport, finance, hobbies of various 
kinds, music, films, agriculture, 
television, radio, education . 

“Wilt!” he shouted. 

The lieutenant, who had been 
on guard outside the door, came 
in at once. 

“Get hold of some Terran films 
made before the occupation force 
arrived. Any kind of films.” 

Wilt shook his head. “Sorry, sir. 
There aren’t any of those either.” 

“Destroyed like the old publica- 
tions?” 

“Yes, sir. They didn’t destroy 
their art treasures, though, if that’s 
any help, sir.” 

“Well, is it?” 

“Not that I could see, sir. Lots 
of nudes. Very beautiful females. 
The males are pretty bulky, how- 
ever.” 

“True to life, at least. Terran 
men are mostly overbuilt.” 

Breeli waved him away and 
stared at the publications that lit- 
tered his bed. In what way were 
these different from the ones which 
had appeared before the occupa- 
tion? In their occasional reference 
to the Pastans, certainly. But that 
was no reason to hide or destroy 
pre-conquest publications. 

One of the magazines had a 
color picture of Margo Day on 
the cover, wearing panties and 
folded arms. In one of the others 
was a picture of Helen Krauss, 



not wearing anything at all. He 
wished he could read what was 
said about them.. 

Still staring at the beautiful pic- 
ture of Margo, he found sleep 
closing in on him. Not unnaturally, 
he had lurid dreams in which Mar- 
go was much more to him than a 
sister. 

T HE next day he was able to 
walk out of the hospital, as 
Wilt had promised, stiff and sore 
but otherwise in good working or- 
der. Wilt wanted to take his arm; 
Breeli refused help. 

“I am not old enough to be 
your father, Lieutenant,” he said, 
annoyed. 

“No, sir. I didn’t think you 
were.” 

“Send Margo Day to me.” 

“Is that wise, sir?” 

Breeli stifled the impulse to 
snap at him. Having chosen Wilt 
because Wilt would answer back, 
he wouldn’t be acting very logical- 
ly to snap at Wilt for doing so. 

“Are you sure Nancy wouldn’t 
kill you?” Breeli asked instead. 

“Quite sure, sir. But that’s dif- 
ferent. I’ve known her for weeks. 
We’ll be married whenever mar- 
riages between Terrans and Pas- 
tans are permitted. This girl Mar- 
go Day—” 

“Nancy’s prepared to go and 
live in Pasta?” 

“Yes, sir. She loves me. But 
Margo Day—” 



THE WRONG WORLD 



29 



“It is inconceivable that any 
woman could ever love me, Lieu- 
tenant?” 

“No, sir. But not in five min- 
utes. Next month Margo Day 
might not want to assassinate you. 
Even next week. But today she 
means what she says.” 

There was a lot of sense in what 
Wilt said, and Breeli made due al- 
lowance for it. Normal women 
with normal instincts, whatever 
their race, found cold hate diffi- 
cult to preserve along with grow- 
ing affection. Wilt’s Nancy had 
probably started out with the at- 
titude which Margo had forcefully 
expressed, but now . yes, Wilt 
was probably right. About Nancy 
and about Margo. 

“Send Margo Day to me,” Bree- 
li said. 

“Yes, sir,” said Wilt disapprov- 
ingly. 

It was very pleasant. 

It gave Breeli no answers. 

Nor, in the days that passed, 
did Breeli find any simple solu- 
tion to his problem. 

In a military sense, Earth was 
submissive. There weren’t even 
riots. The countries of the world 
went about their business, for the 
most part ignoring the Pastan con- 
quest. Earth’s economic, social and 
political systems hadn’t been as 
easily upset as Breeli had feared. 

But every day, somewhere, 
despite their shields, four or five 
Pastan soldiers died. Usually four 



or five Terrans died with them. 
But Earth could afford it, not be- 
ing at the end of a light-years- 
long supply and reinforcements 
line. 

The plain fact was, Earth didn’t 
want to be occupied. 

Once Breeli said to Dorothy 
Green: “If I wanted to have a con- 
ference with Earth’s leaders, could 
you arrange it? How long would 
you need?” 

“You can tell me anything you 
want communicated to the Terran 
governments, sir.” 

“Yes, but I might want to see 
them myself.” 

“I’m chief liaison officer, sir.” 
There was mild reproof in her 
tone. < 

“I know that. But what if I have 
an offer to make?” 

“You can make it to me, sir.” 

And with that Breeli had to be 
content. He made no offer. He 
didn’t know what to offer. 

Q EEING no harm in it, he is- 
^ sued an order permitting in- 
termarriage. One of the first to 
take advantage of this was Lieu- 
tenant Wilt, who married his Nan- 
cy. Breeli attended the wedding 
and kissed the bride. Wilt was 
right — Nancy was a pretty girl. 
Not a Margo Day, but pretty. 

Seeing them together, Breeli 
didn’t think Nancy could possibly 
be playing a part. 

As far as he could, Breeli kept 



30 



GALAXY 



out of Prani’s way because he 
knew that whatever happened he 
was Prani’s executioner. Breeli 
had no choice about that — only 
about the manner and date of 
Prani’s trial. 

He made a lot of visits to vari- 
ous parts of the world, accom- 
panied by Margo and a suitable 
number of guards. 

In Hawaii Margo said: “Come 
for a swim, sire. I’ll find out where 
you’re most likely to be eaten by 
a shark.” 

In the Swiss Alps she said: 
“Let’s climb a mountain, sire, and 
I’ll push you off.” 

In Brazil she stopped calling 
him “sire.” Knowing she used the 
title as an insult, Breeli had 
steadfastly refused to comment 
on it one way or the other. But 
when she started calling him Breel 
— the “I” on the end of his name 
was titular — he began to suspect 
that even if she got the chance to 
assassinate him, she wouldn’t. ' 

In Australia she said: “Do you 
really need all these guards, Breel? 
I’m getting tired of sleeping six 
in a bed.” 

This was exaggeration. Breeli 
never slept in the same room as 
she did, but apart from refusing to 
let her near him when he was 
asleep, he took no special pre- 
cautions against her. 

In England he gave her a 
chance to kill him and she didn’t 
take it. 



In Florida she said: “Yes, Breel, 
I’ll marry you.” 

She insisted on fixing the date 
of the wedding, which for a mo- 
ment made him suspicious again. 
Assassinations had tailed off late- 
ly. Intuitively, when she picked 
the following Friday, he suspected 
that something was due to happen 
on Friday. 

Suppose a Terran coup of some 
kind had been planned. Surprise 
would be essential, for the Pastans 
had decisively overcome all 
Earth’s resistance once, and 
could do it again. And if such a 
coup had been planned, Margo, 
given the chance to assassinate 
the Consolidation Officer, might 
very well refrain. 

“You’re up to something,” he 
said. 

“Look, Breel,” she said. “We’d 
better get one thing straight. If I 
marry you, I’ll mean it. I’ll go any- 
where with you. I’ll become as 
Pastan as you are. There’s noth- 
ing new in that. Lots of girls have 
married former enemies. Once 
we’re married, you can trust me.” 

“I believe all that. But you 
make me more certain than ever 
that something’s going to happen 
between now and Friday.” 

She laughed in the old mock- 
ing way and said nothing. 

I N the night he tossed and 
turned uneasily, and at last 
opened his eyes and looked at 



THE WRONG WORLD 



31 



Margo, sleeping peacefully be- 
side him. The moonlight which 
shone through the uncurtained 
window rimlit the lovely satin 
skin of cheek, shoulder and breast. 
For a week now he had trusted 
her to the extent of sleeping with 
her. 

He loved her and he was all but 
certain she loved him. Yet he knew 
his duty was to find out whatever 
it was she knew, however he had 
to do it. 

She knew something and had 
hardly bothered to deny it. When 
they had talked hours ago, things 
had been easy, comfortable be- 
tween them, and it had been more 
or less a joke that Margo wouldn’t 
tell him what was on her mind. 

In the stillness of the night, it 
was clear that it was no joke. He 
ought to turn her over to the psy- 
chologists to have whatever she 
knew pried out of her. 

He got up and paced about the 
bedroom restlessly. Aside from 
the time when the car he was in 
had been blown to pieces, his stay 
on Earth had been too pleasant, 
too easy, too spuriously comfort- 
able. He hadn’t seen any shooting, 
fighting, dying. Any killing he 
heard of, except that one incident, 
had been offstage. 

Yet he knew that the Terrans 
had a passionate love of liberty 
and would do anything to drive 
the invaders from their world. 



The only reason for their present 
comparative passiveness was that 
there was nothing they could do 
against the diverter, and they 
knew it. They could attack every 
one of the Pastan Army’s bases 
and installations from all direc- 
tions at once, but if they did so, 
they’d simply be shut out until 
the Pastans were ready to strike 
back, and then get beaten as de- 
cisively as before. They knew it. 
That was why the occupation was 
apparently peaceful. 

There remained the fact that 
Prani had immorally and illegal- 
ly attacked and conquered a Nine- 
teenth Level world, and Breeli 
still hadn’t the ghost of an idea 
what to do about it 

He had never had a survey 
made to establish beyond doubt 
what the Terrans’ cultural level 
actually was. The reason was 
that it was still possible to pretend 
that Earth was Seventeenth Level, 
although the pretense was pretty 
thin. 

After a survey, it would no longer 
be possible. 

“Come back to bed, darling,” 
Margo muttered sleepily. 

“What’s going to happen on Fri- 
day?” he demanded. 

“Friday?” She smiled without 
opening her eyes. “I’m going to get 
married.” 

Long after she was asleep, Bree- 
li stared at her. Finally he told 
himself he was imagining things. 



32 



GALAXY 



A LTHOUGH marriage hadn’t 
long been permitted between 
Pastans and Terrans, already near- 
ly half the occupying forces had 
married Terran girls. It wasn’t 
really surprising — only single 
men were sent on occupation du- 
ties, except for top brass like 
General Prani. 

The strange thing was that the 
Terrans seemed to regard Pastan- 
Terran marriage as a joke. 

When it was announced that 
Governor Breeli was to marry 
Margo Day, cartoons depicting 
him and Margo in improbable atti- 
tudes appeared in most Terran 
newspapers. They were never ac- 
tually obscene or libelous. But 
Breeli learned how astute Terran 
newspapermen could be in estab- 
lishing just how far they could 
go, and then go there with barely 
a millimeter to spare. 

Breeli found Margo at the pool 
chuckling over a cartoon in one of 
the New York papers. It depicted 
a very glamorous Margo with an 
unglamorous Breeli at her feet 
and the Earth at Breeli’s. 

“Is that funny?” he asked. 

“I think so. You wouldn’t.” 
“I’m supposed to have a sense 
of humor.” 

“The man who gets a custard 
pie in his face never thinks it’s 
funny.” 

“Is marrying you like getting 
a custard pie in my face?” 

She sobered. “You don’t really 



mind, Breel? I didn’t think it 
would bother you.” 

“It doesn’t. But I didn’t expect 
to find you laughing at a thing 
like that.” 

“Well, you at my feet, and the ' 
Earth at yours . Every girl 
wants to marry a prince, especial- 
ly Americans, who sneer at 
princes, and you’re a sort of prince. 
Tell me, is the wedding off?” 

He looked at her. She wore a 
deep green swimsuit which 
brought out all her vivid color- 
ing. He had had plenty of oppor- 
tunity to tire of her, but the re- 
sult had been quite the opposite. 
He reached for her. 

Feeling her stiffen, he cast a 
glance over his shoulder. He 
blinked incredulously. Dorothy 
Green, most unexpectedly clad in 
a white two-piece swimsuit, and 
smiling, was coming to join them. 
She looked more like a bean-pole 
than usual. 

“Mind if I talk to you?” she 
asked Breeli. 

“Go right ahead,” said Margo 
viciously, and jumped to her feet 
and walked away. 

Breeli stared after her. 

“What got into Margo?” he 
asked. 

Dorothy sat by the edge of the 
pool where Margo had been. 
“She’s a patriot,” she said indif- 
ferently. “Patriots can’t be ex- 
pected to like me.” 

“But she’s marrying me. I’m a 



THE WRONG WORLD 



33 




Pastan. Why should she hate you 
for working with Pastans?” 

Dorothy shrugged. “I thought 
you understood people, Governor. 
Does anyone like a traitor — even 
the people who use the traitor?” 
“But you’re not . well, never 
mind. What do you want to talk 
about?” 

It was the wedding, of course. 
Dorothy was in charge of security 
arrangements. For ten minutes 
they discussed the matter as im- 
personally as if it were a cattle 



show. Breeli agreed that a Ter- 
ran church wedding would be 
best, with a Pastan ceremony 
back on Pasta later. 

At the end of ten minutes, find- 
ing Dorothy brighter and more 
sympathetic than usual, Breeli I 
asked : “What kind of wedding did 
you have?” 

A spasm crossed her face. 
“Please. We’re concerned only 
with you and Margo Day.” 

“We could arrange to have 
your husband present if you like.” 



/"kNCE more passion flamed in 
her eyes. She jumped to her 
feet exactly as Margo had done, 
and was going to hurry away like- 
wise. But Breeli caught her around 
the waist and pulled her down 
again. It was like handling an un- 
dernourished child. 

“Dorothy,” he said, “is there 
something I don’t know about 
your husband? Was he wounded 
in the fighting? Has he been bad- 
ly treated? Or what?” 

Her passion died, and her small 



breasts stopped heaving. “You 
don’t know?” she whispered. “I 
thought you did, I thought . 
I apologize, Governor. No, it 
wasn’t anything to do with the 
fighting. Long before that, Jack 
was . sick.” 

“What do you mean, sick?” 

“His njind ... if you must have 
it in plain language, Governor, 
he’s out of his mind. No, he isn’t 
badly treated. In fact, one of the 
reasons I took this job was be- 
cause he’d be treated better as a

hostage, better looked after, than 
I could afford otherwise.” 

“But why hasn’t he been cured?” 
“Incurable, Governor.” There 
was a world of grief in her voice. 
“Brain damage?” 

“No. I’m not a psychologist, 
Governor, and anyway, I’d rather 
not talk about it. There’s a Pastan 
doctor at the internment camp, a 
Dr. Morn. Ask him.” 

Breeli stood up. “I will. Dor- 
othy, if I’ve said anything that 
hurt you, I’m sorry. I didn’t know 
about this.” 

He had himself driven to the 
camp and saw Jack Green through 
one-way glass. Dorothy’s husband 
was a tall, massive young man 
who sat very still and stared at 
the floor. 

“Manic-depressive,” Dr. Mom 
explained, turning away. “A very 
sad case. I’ve requested permis- 
sion to treat him, but so far I’ve 
had no reply. I presume my re- 
quest is shuttling back and forth 
along a series of muddy ruts 
known as the usual channels.” 
“Could you cure him?” 

“Within a week.” 

“Then go ahead. You have per- 
mission now.” 

“Thank you. These Terrans 
have a wry saying: Better late 
than never.” 

“Have you any idea, Doctor, 
why the Terrans left him like 
that? Is he some kind of criminal 
or outcast?” 



Dr. Morn raised his eyebrows 
quizzically. “Do you mean you 
don’t know? Haven’t you seen my 
report?” 

“It, too, is probably shuttling 
through the usual channels,” said 
Breeli drily. “What was it about?” 

“The Terrans haven’t cured him 
because they can’t. Though a very 
advanced people in many ways, 
they’re backward in psychologi- 
cal medicine.” 

Breeli stared at him. “You mean 
they can’t cure neuroses? But I 
haven’t seen an uncompensated 
neurotic yet.” 

“You wouldn’t. They’re really 
a remarkably stable race — which, 
perhaps, is why psychological 
medicine has lagged among them. 
Really serious neurosis is com- 
paratively rare. But when it does 
occur, they can’t do a thing about 
it.” 

“So, unless you took a hand, 
Jack Green would be like that 
for the rest of his life?” 

“Yes.” 

“His wife, Doctor — have you 
met his wife?” 

“Yes.” The doctor sighed. “A 
remarkably plain girl, in a world 
of such feminine pulchritude. How- 
ever, she’s gone through a lot of 
unnecessary misery.” 

“Didn’t you tell her he could 
be cured?” 

“Until I was permitted to do so, 
I hardly thought it humane to 
tell her I could.” 



36 



GALAXY 



“No, of course not. And by the 
same token, I won’t tell her what’s 
going on until he is cured. Will 
you send him to HQ when the 
cure is complete, Dr. Mom? I’ll 
take the responsibility.” 

The doctor looked puzzled. 
“But why not tell her now?” 
“And get her so hopeful that 
she has no thought for — collabo- 
ration? That’s not practical poli- 
tics, Doctor.” 

I T wasn’t until he was almost 
back at HQ that the signifi- 
cance of Dr. Morn’s explanation 
detonated under Breeli like the 
bomb which had nearly killed him. 

The Eighteenth Level was the 
level of stability. It was the level 
of culture at which a race learned 
to repair its own mental disorders. 

The Terrans were an exception- 
ally stable race, though quite pos- 
sibly they themselves didn’t think 
so. Neurotics among them gen- 
erally managed to compensate 
without treatment. Though they 
remained neurotics, they seldom 
reached the state at which treat- 
ment, in a Pastan world, would 
have been compulsory. 

Consequently the Terrans had, 
in effect, reached the Nineteenth 
Level by a different route from 
the usual one. From the standard 
point of view, they were Nine- 
teenth Level; there was no doubt 
about that. 

But part of the definition of the 



rise from Seventeenth to Eigh- 
teenth Level was the development 
of practical psychological medi- 
cine. 

Technically, the Terrans were 
Seventeenth Level and the con- 
quest of Earth had been quite in 
order. 

It was a technicality, of course, 
Put on the right track, Terran psy- 
chologists could develop the neces- 
sary techniques in a matter of 
months. Then, by any standards, 
they would be Nineteenth Level. 

But it was all Breeli needed. 
Now he could whitewash Prani and 
the conquest of Earth and anything 
else he liked. There would be no 
need to mention that he’d spent 
weeks on Earth before learning 
about the gap. 

He almost danced into HQ. 

“General,” he said with more 
cordiality then he had shown since 
the moment he met Prani, “you’re 
saved. The Terrans are Seven- 
teenth Level.” 

Prani was affronted. “Sir, you 
know very well they’re Nineteenth. 
No Seventeenth Level race could 
have fought such battles. Modesty 
apart, I may say — ” 

“General,” said Breeli with only 
mild exasperation, “if you follow 
that line, you’re dead. Your only 
hope is to let me show that the 
Terrans are Seventeenth Level. 
Now are you going to do as I say, 
or do I have to relieve you of your 
command?” 



THE WRONG WORLD

“Sir!” The general went white, 
then red, then mottled. 

“I can do it, you know.” 

“Yes, sir, I know, but — ” 

“All right, then. I have reason to 
believe that something’s brewing. 
I don’t know what, but it doesn’t 
matter. As of ten minutes from 
now, all bases will be closed until 
further notice. Recall all person- 
nel. Set diverters to exclude bombs, 
shells, gas, men, women, children 
and all animals, insects and bac- 
teria. Transmit these orders 
through Pastan personnel, not 
through Dorothy Green, or any 
other Green or Dorothy. The only 
contact between Pastans and Ter- 
rans in the next few days will be 
the marriage of myself and Margo.” 
“But that’s the first thing to can- 
cel, sir! If there’s really going to 
be a revolt, there must be plans for 
your assassination at the cere- 
mony!” 

“I don’t think so. But I’ll warn 
Dorothy and Margo that if there 
are, it’ll be the worst mistake Earth 
ever made.” 

yV^ITH some difficulty Breeli 
’’ found Dr. Morn’s report, 
stuck fast in a bottleneck. He read 
it with interest. 

The Terrans, like all races which 
didn’t have psychotherapy that 
really worked, were all more or less 
off balance. That didn’t make them 
much different from any other 
highly developed race, or the Pas- 



tans themselves, for every ad- 
vanced civilization permitted a lot 
of personal liberty, which meant 
that only dangerous psychotics 
could be compulsorily treated. 
Earth achieved much the same 
practical result by shutting dang- 
erous psychotics away in asylums 
or prisons. 

But the Terrans were conscious 
of the deficiency and uneasy about 
it. There were experiments in re- 
habilitation — idealistic, danger- 
ous experiments when no practical 
psychotherapeutic techniques ex- 
isted. 

The Terrans would be very glad 
to have a psychotherapy which 
worked. 

Seeing all his troubles dissolving, 
Breeli once more felt like dancing. 
When he met Margo in one of the 
corridors, he did literally dance 
into his office with her. 

“What’s got into you, Breel?” 
she asked breathlessly. 

“I’ve just found the key!” he 
cried. 

“What key?” 

“The key to Terran-Pastan co- 
operation. Friendship. Peace. Alli- 
ance.” 

“Isn’t that a bit optimistic?” 

“No. After we’re married, I’ll tell 
you about it.” 

“I think you’d better tell me 
now.” 

He grinned at her. “Margo, I 
don’t care what you’ve got up your 
sleeve. I’ve got something bigger* 



38 



GALAXY 



She looked at him thoughtfully. 
“You’ve got something that’s going 
to put you in a strong position?” 

“Yes.” 

“Then maybe it had better wait. 
You’re going to need it” 

He sobered. “Margo, I’m trust- 
ing you. If there’s anything funny 
about the ceremony, your world 
will regret it for generations. That’s 
not a threat. It’s a friendly warn- 
ing.” 

“Didn’t I promise it would go 
off according to plan?” 

“Yes, but long ago you told me 
you’d promise anything I liked, and 
I’d be a fool to believe you. Didn’t 
you?” 

She was hurt. “Why are you 
marrying me if you don’t trust 
me?” 

“Because you’re beautiful and I 
love you.” 

“Is that the right order of im- 
portance?” 

“No. Honestly, Margo, I don’t 
think you’d betray me.” 

She looked at him with troubled 
eyes. 

r I ' HE wedding of Margo Day and 
Consolidation Officer Breeli — 
or Governor Breeli, as he was 
known to the Terrans — was a big 
propaganda occasion. 

It took place in St. Clement’s 
Church in a small town near Prani’s 
headquarters. Film and television 
cameras were there in force. Margo 
and Breeli were attended by near- 



ly all the Pastans who had married 
Terrans, and Terrans who had mar- 
ried Pastans — a large congrega- 
tion. That had been Dorothy 
Green’s inspiration. 

Margo looked ravishing in pink. 
Breeli wore a Terran suit Dorothy 
Green was matron of honor. 

The Reverend Thaddeus White 
had refused to perform the cere- 
mony until he had a chat with 
Breeli about religion. Finding that 
the Pastan view of a Divine Pur- 
pose was not so different, he had 
withdrawn his objections and 
agreed to officiate. 

Nothing untoward happened un- 
til Margo and Breeli left the 
church. Then Breeli was rather sur- 
prised to find Dorothy coming into 
their car with them. 

“Do we need a chaperon?” he 
asked Margo. 

“Mr. Breeli,” said Dorothy, as 
the car started, “you are no longer 
governor. You and Margo are 
being deported at once.” 

Breeli smiled. “Tell me more.” 

“I’m sorry about this, Breel,” 
Margo said, “but I did want to 
marry you, and I also wanted to 
free Earth. That’s why it was timed 
this way. I’m coming with you to 
the spaceport.” 

“And what are you going to do 
about the Pastan bases all over 
Earth?” 

“We’re not going to do any- 
thing,” said Dorothy calmly. 
“We’ve done it.” 



THE WRONG WORLD 



39 



For the first time Breeli became 
anxious. “What are you trying to 
tell me?” 

“Well, it’s been a fairly blood- 
less victory,” Dorothy Green said. 
“We don’t want another war. But 
you’re reasonable people. Now 
that we have the diverter, I don’t 
think you’ll want to — ” 

“You have the diverter?” 
Dorothy shrugged. “Well, how 
long did you think it would take 
us to crack it? An hour ago, we 
cancelled all diverter fields, and 
thousands of men walked into 
every Pastan base and took over. 
There were hardly any casualties. 
I’m sorry to report that General 
Prani is dead- he wasn’t very good 
with weapons, I’m afraid. We’re 
sending you and every Pastan 
officer or soldier who married a 
Terran girl back to Pasta, and 
keeping everybody else prisoner. I 
, think we should be able to reach 
agreement after you’ve reported 
the facts to your government and 
come back to arrange terms.” 
Breeli began to laugh silently. 
Prani’s death was unfortunate, but 
it would simplify matters. It was 
ironic that as soon as Breeli had 
discovered Earth was technically 
a Seventeenth Level world, and 
the conquest was therefore justi- 
fied, they should pull something 
like this. 

Margo was laughing too, puzzled 
but prepared to share the joke. 
Dorothy was merely puzzled. 



“Tell the driver to take us to 
HQ,” Breeli said. 

“We’re taking you to the space- 
port. You’re to be—” 

“I know. Let’s go to HQ all the 
same. I’m expecting somebody 
there.” 

“You’re not Governor Breeli 
any more,” Dorothy said again. 
“You don’t give the orders — ” 
“I’m expecting Jack Green,” 
Breeli said. 

That passion in her eyes again, 
she grabbed Breeli’s shoulders. 
“What have you done to him?” 
“Tell the driver,” Breeli said. 
She did so. 

XT EADQUARTERS looked the 
same, except that there were 
no Pastans about, only Terrans, 
mostly men, none of whom Breeli 
had ever seen before. A tall, broad 
Terran colonel called Armstrong 
seemed to be in charge. 

“Well done,” Breeli congratu- 
lated him. “A very well-planned 
operation.” 

“Thank you,” said the colonel, 
surprised but courteous. “What are 
you doing here?” 

Breeli had Margo on one arm 
and Dorothy on the other. “Frank- 
ly, this maneuver of yours comes 
at a very convenient time. I’m glad 
it was comparatively bloodless, 
though. I couldn’t have condoned 
a massacre. Now that this has hap- 
pened, I think we should withdraw 
in force. Only don’t you think it 



40 



GALAXY 



would be better if the Pastans who 
have married Terran women re- 
main here, and all the others go 
home?” 

“You don’t seem to understand 
the situation,” said Armstrong. 
“We’re in command now.” 

“Perhaps,” Breeli admitted. 
“But the Pastans with Terran sym- 
pathies are the obvious ones to 
stay here while the agreements are 
arranged. Margo and I will go, but 
not for long. We’ll be back.” 

The colonel’s courtesy was wear- 
ing thin. “Mr. Breeli, we don’t want 
a state of perpetual warfare be- 
tween Earth and Pasta. That’s why 
we planned a coup with as few 
casualties as possible on either side. 
But 

“But we still have something to 
offer,” Breeli said, “a high card to 
play.” His gaze rose over Dorothy’s 
head. She turned and gasped. 

Jack Green strode to her and 
took her in his arms. There was 
something in his appearance, his 
bearing, that showed he was a 
whole man again. 

Suddenly the unfeminine Doro- 
thy Green became very feminine. 

“Was that your key?” Margo 
demanded. 

“Yes. Won’t Earth be grateful 
for sanity? No more psychopaths. 
You’ll be able to get by with al- 
most no prisons and much smaller 
asylums. We can’t do anything for 
congenital defects, I’m afraid, but 
aside from that, only physical brain 



damage is beyond our skill.” 

The colonel was out of his depth. 
Dorothy, however, once she had 
recovered from the altogether 
pleasant shock, became chief liai- 
son officer very strongly biased in 
Breeli’s favor. 

“Shall we go into your office, Mr. 
Breeli?” she asked, still in Jack 
Green’s arms. 

I N the end, as Breeli had sug- 
gested, it was the Pastans who 
had not married Terran women 
who returned immediately to their 
own world. Some of them were 
very reluctant to go. 

Margo and Nancy were the only 
Terrans to leave with them. Breeli 
was not unaware of the effect they 
were going to have on Pastan TV. 

The arrangements had been 
easy because Earth had prudently 
decided not to be difficult, realiz- 
ing that if Pasta’s tail were tweaked 
too violently, Earth might still be 
reconquered. 

“You seem happy,” Margo said 
as the Pastan ship prepared to 
make the first hyperspace jump. 

“I am,” said Breeli. “I’m going 
on my honeymoon. And you should 
see my bride!” 

“You don’t care that we won 
in the end?” 

He wondered whether to tell her 
the truth, and decided against it. 
It wouldn’t make any Terran any 
happier to know that the brief war 
had been unnecessary, that those 



THE WRONG WORLD 



41 



who had died shouldn’t have died. 
Let Margo believe, as Breeli’s su- 
perior’s would believe, that Earth 
had been a paradox, a Seventeenth 
Level world that went straight to 
Nineteenth when Pastan psychol- 
ogists told them a few things they 
ought to have seen for themselves 
long ago. 

He kissed her instead. 

S HE released herself. “Breel, 
I’ve got a confession to make.” 
“You needn’t bother,” he said. 
“I figured it out long ago.” 

She gasped. 

“And I don’t mind,” he added. 
“Why should I?” 

“I didn’t think you would, be- 
cause it’s what you think that 
matters. But how did you know?” 
“You went too far trying to hide 
it. Destroying all old publications 
and films . .” 

“Yes, but if any Pastan had seen 
one, he’d have known — ” 

“Perhaps. But girls like you and 
Helen Krauss and the others were 
brave, and you were necessary to 
Earth’s plans. We had to take Ter- 
ran mistresses or you’d never have 
been able to find out the things you 
did. Only somebody thought we’d 
better not know that the Terran 
girls we happened to admire were- 



n’t the ones Terrans regarded as 
glamor girls. It wouldn’t have 
made any difference, Margo. You 

— and the Rubens and Greek nudes 

— would still have appealed to us.” 
“That’s what’s so wonderful,” she 

said. “You’d never believe how 
nice it is to find people who think 
you’re beautiful after knowing all 
your life that — ” 

Breeli shook his head. “You’re 
perfect.” 

“Glad you think so.” And she 
meant it. 

“They must have found out very 
early,” Breeli said, “that we were 
attracted to the Rubens type. And 
they thought something might be 
made of the fact. So they carefully 
prevented us from finding out the 
kind of girls they were attracted to. 
They needn’t have bothered. We 
must have seen some of the girls 
they think are beautiful, and didn’t 
give them a second glance.” 

“You did,” said Margo. 

‘Who, for instance?” 

“Dorothy Green.” 

“You’re not going to tell me 
she’s the Terran idea of a glamor 
girl!” 

“Six years ago,” said Margo, 
“she was Miss America — just be- 
fore she married Jack Green.”

A Konv cylinder was the key 
to space — but there was one 
power it could not match! 



Illustrated by GRAY 



T HEY lived in a small house 
beside the little Wolf river 
in Wisconsin. Once it had 
been a summer cottage owned by 
a rich man from Chicago. The rich 
man died. His heirs sold it. Now it 
was well insulated and Mrs. Jamie- 
son and her son were very com- 
i fortable, even in the coldest winter. 
During the summer they rented a 
few row boats to vacationing fisher- 
JAMIESON 



men, and she had built a few over- 
night cabins beside the road. They 
were able to make ends meet. 

Her neighbors knew nothing of 
the money she had brought with 
her to Wisconsin. They didn’t even 
know that she was not a native. She 
never spoke of it, except at first, 
when Earl was a boy of seven and 
they had just come there to live. 
Then she only said that she came 

43 



from the East. She knew the names 
of eastern Wisconsin towns, and 
small facts about them; it lent an 
air of authenticity to her claim of 
being a native. Actually her previ- 
ous residence was Bangkok, Siam, 
where the Agents had killed her 
husband. 

That was back in ’07, on the eve 
of his departure for Alpha Centau- 
rus; but she never spoke of this; and 
she was very careful not to move 
from place to place except by the 
conventional methods of travel. 

Also, she wore her hair long, al- 
most to the shoulders. People said, 
“There goes one of the old-fash- 
ioned ones. That hair-do was popu- 
lar back in the sixties.” They did 
not suspect that she did this only 
to cover the thin, pencil-line scar, 
evidence that a small cylinder lay 
under her skin behind the ear. 

For Mrs. Jamieson was one of 
the Konvs. 

Her husband had been one of the 
small group who developed this 
tiny instrument Not the inventor 
—his name was Stinson, and the ef- 
fects produced by it were known as 
the Stinson Effect. In appearance 
it resembled a small semi-conduc- 
tor device. Analysis by the best sci- 
entific minds proved it to be a semi- 
conductor. 

Yet it held the power to move a 
body instantly from one point in 
space to any other point. Each 
unit was custom built, keyed to 
operate only by the thought pat- 
44 



tern of the particular individual. 

Several times in the past seven 
years Mrs. Jamieson had seen 
other Konvs, and had been 
tempted to identify herself and say, 
“Here I am. You are one of them; 
so am I. Come, and we’ll talk. We’ll 
talk about Stinson and Benjamin, 
who helped them all get away. And 
Doctor Straus. And my husband, 
E. Mason Jamieson, who never got 
away because those filthy, unspeak- 
able Agents shot him in the back, 
there in that coffee shop in Bang- 
kok, Siam.” 

/"kNCE, in the second year after 
her husband’s death, an Agent 
came and stayed in one of her 
cabins. 

She learned that he was an 
Agent completely by accident. 
While cleaning the cabin one morn- 
ing his badge fell out of a shirt 
pocket. She stood still, staring at 
the horror of it there on the floor, 
the shirt in her hands, all the lone- 
liness returning in a black wave of 
hate and frustration. 

That night she soundlessly lifted 
the screen from the window over 
his bed and shot him with a .22 
rifle. 

She threw the weapon into the 
river. It helped very little. He was 
one Agent, only one out of all the 
thousands of Agents all over Earth; 
while her husband had been one 
of twenty-eight persons. She de- 
cided then that her efforts would 



GALAXY 



be too ineffective. The odds were 
wrong. She would wait until her 
son, Earl, was grown. 

Together they would seek re- 
venge. He did not have the cylin-' 
der — not yet. But he would. The 
Konvs took care of their own. 

Her husband had been one of 
the first, and they would not for- 
get. One day the boy would disap- 
pear for a few hours. When he re- 
turned the small patch of gauze 
would be behind his ear. She would 
shield him until the opening healed. 
Then no one would ever know, be- 
cause now they could do it without 
leaving the tell-tale scar. Then they 
would seek revenge. 

Later they would go to Alpha 
Centaurus, where a life free from 
Agents could be lived. 

It happened to Earl one hot sum- 
mer day when he was fourteen. 
Mrs. Jamieson was working in her 
kitchen; Earl supposedly was 
swimming with his friends in the 
river. Suddenly he appeared before 
her, completely nude. At sight of 
his mother his face paled and he be- 
gan to shake violently, so that she 
was forced to slap him to prevent 
hysteria. She looked behind his ear. 

It was there. 

“Mom!” he cried. “Mom!” 

He went to the window and 
looked out toward the river, where 
his friends were still swimming in 
the river, with great noise and de- 
light. Apparently they did not miss 
him. Mrs. Jamieson handed him a 
JAM I ESON 



pair of trousers. “Here, get yourself 
dressed. Then we’ll talk.” 

TTE started for his room, but she 
stopped him. “No, do it right 
here. You may as well get used to 
it now.” 

“Get used to what?” 

“To people seeing you nude.” 
“What?” 

“Never mind. What happened 
just now?” 

“I was swimming in the river, 
and a man came down to the river. 
His hair was all white, and his eyes 
looked like . well, I never saw 
eyes like his before. He asked who 
was Earl Jamieson, and I said I 
was. Then he said, ‘Come with me.’ 
I went with him. I don’t know why. 
It seemed the right thing. He took 
me to a car and there was another 
man in it, that looked like the first 
one only he was bigger. We went to 
a house, not far away and went in- 
side. And that’s all I can remember 
until I woke up. I was on a table, 
sort of. A high table. There was a 
light over it. It was all strange, and 
the two men stood there talking in 
some language I don’t know.” 

Earl ran his hand through his 
hair, shaking his head. “I don’t re- 
member clearly, I guess. I was look- 
ing around the room and I remem- 
ber thinking how scared I was, and 
how nice it would be to be here 
with you. And then I was here.” 
Earl faced the window, looking 
out, then turned quickly back. 

45 



“What is it?” he asked, desperately. 
“What happened to me?” 

“Better put your trousers on,” 
Mrs. Jamieson said. “It’s something 
very unusual and terrible to think 
of at first, but really wonderful.” 
“But what happened? What is 
this patch behind my ear?” 

Suddenly his face paled and he 
stopped in the act of getting into 
his trousers. “Guess I know now. 
They made me a Konv.” 

“Well, don’t take on so. You’ll 
get used to it.” 

“But they shouldn’t have! They 
didn’t even ask me!” 

He started for the door, but she 
called him back. “No, don’t run 
away from it now. This is the time 
to face it. There are two sides to 
every story, you know. You hear 
only one side in school — their side. 
There is also our side.” 

He turned back, a dawning com- 
prehension showing in his eyes. 
“That’s right, you’re one, too. That 
is why you killed that Agent in the 
third cabin.” 

It was her turn to be surprised. 
“You knew about that?” 

“I saw you. I wasn’t sleeping. I 
was afraid to stay inside alone, so 
I followed you. I never told any- 
one.” 

“But you were only nine!” 
“They would have taken you 
away if I’d said anything.” 

Mrs. Jamieson held out her 
hand. “Come here, son. It’s time I 
told you about us.” 

46 



S O he sat across the kitchen table 
from her, and she told the 
whole history, beginning with 
Stinson sitting in the laboratory in I 
New Jersey, holding in his hand a I 
small cylinder moulded from sili- I 
con with controlled impurities. He 
had made it, looking for a better 
micro-circuit structure. He was 
holding this cylinder . and it was 
a cold day outside . and he was 
dreaming of a sunny Florida 
beach— 

And suddenly he was there, on 
the beach. He could not believe it 
at first. He felt the sand and water, 
and felt of himself; there was no 
mistake. 

On the plane back to New Jer- 
sey he came to certain conclusions 
regarding the strange power of his 
device. He tried it again, secretly. 
Then he made more cylinders. He 
was the only man in the world who 
knew how to construct it, and he 
kept the secret, giving cylinders to 
selected people. He worked out the j 
basic principle, calling it a kinetic 
ordinate of negative vortices, which 
was very undefinitive. 

It was a subject of wonder and 
much speculation, but no one took 
serious notice of them until one 
night a federal Agent arrested one 
man for indecency. It was a valid 
charge. One disadvantage of this 
method of travel was that, while a 
body could travel instantaneously 
to any chosen spot, it arrived with- 
out clothes. 



GALAXY 




JAMIESON 



47 




The arrested man disappeared 
from his jail cell, and the next 
morning the Agent was found 
strangled to death in his bed. This 
set off a campaign against Konvs. 
One base act led to another, until 
the original reason for noticing 
them at all was lost. Normal men 
no longer thought of them as hu- 
man. 

Mrs. Jamieson told how Stinson, 
knowing he had made too many 
cylinders and given them unwisely, 
left Earth for Alpha Centaurus. 

He went alone, not knowing if he 
could go so far, or what he would 
find when he arrived. But he did 
arrive, and it was what he had 
sought. 

He returned for the others. They 
gathered one night in a dirty, brok- 
en-down farmhouse in Missouri— 
and disappeared in a body, leaving 
the Agents standing helplessly on 
Earth, shaking their fists at the sky. 

“You have asked many times,” 
Mrs. Jamieson said, “how your 
father died. Now I will tell you the 
truth. Your father was one of the 
great ones, along with Stinson and 
Benjamin and Dr. Straus. He 
helped plan the escape; but the 
Agents found him in Bangkok fif- 
teen minutes before the group left 
They shot him in the back, and the 
others had to go on without him. 
Now do you know why I killed the 
Agent in the third cabin? I had to. 
Your father was a great man, and 
I loved him.” 



“I don’t blame you, mother,” ; 
Earl said simply. “But we are 
freaks. Everybody says, ‘Konv’ as 
if it is something dirty. They write 
it on the walls in rest rooms.” 

“Of course they do — because 
they don’t understand! They are 
afraid of us. Wouldn’t you be afraid 
of someone who could do the things 
we do, if you couldn’t do them?” 

Just like that, it was over. 

That is, the first shock was over. 
Mrs. Jamieson watched Earl leave I 
the house, walking slowly along the I 
river, a boy with a man’s problems. I 
His friends called to him from the j 
river, but he chose not to hear. He 
wanted to be alone. He needed to | 
think, to feel the newness of the 
thing. 

Perhaps he would crqss the river 
and enter the deep forest there. 
When the initial shock wore off he 
might experiment with his new 
power. He would not travel far, in 
these first attempts. Probably he 
would stay within walking distance 
of his clothes, because he still 
lacked the tricks others had 
learned. 

It was a hot, mucky afternoon 
with storm clouds pushing out of 
the west. Mrs. Jamieson put on her 
swimming suit and wandered down 
to the river to cool herself. 

TT'OR the remainder of that sum- 
mer they worked together. 
They practiced at night mostly, 
taking longer and longer jumps, un-

til Earl’s confidence allowed him 
to reach any part of the Earth he 
chose. She knew the habits of 
Agents. She knew how to avoid 
them. 

They would select a spot suffi- 
ciently remote to insure detection, 
she would devise some prank to 
irritate the Agents; then they would 
quickly return to Wisconsin. The 
Agents would rush to the calcu- 
lated spot, but would find only the 
bare footprints of a woman and a 
boy. They would swear and drive 
back to their offices to dig through 
files, searching for some clue to 
their identity. 

It was inevitable that they 
should identify Mrs. Jamieson as 
: one of the offenders, since they had 
discovered, even before Stinson 
j took his group to Centaurus, that 
individuals had thought patterns 
i peculiar to themselves. These could 
i be identified, if caught on their de- 
tectors, and even recorded for the 
files. But the files proved confusing, 
for they said that Mrs. Jamieson 
had gone to Centaurus with the 
others. 

Had she returned to Earth? The 
question did not trouble them long. 
They had more serious problems. 
Stinson had selected only the best 
of the Konvs when he left Earth, 
leaving all those with criminal ten- 
dencies behind. They could have 
followed if they chose — what could 
stop them? But it was more lucra- 
tive to stay. On Earth they could 
JAMIESON 



rob, loot, even murder — without 
fear of the law. 

Earl changed. 

Even before the summer was 
over, he matured. The childish an- 
tics of his friends began to bore 
him. “Be careful, Earl,” his mother 
would say. “Remember who you 
are. Play with them sometimes, 
even if you don’t like it. You have 
a long way to go before you will be 
ready.” 

During the long winter evenings, 
after they had watched their favor- 
ite video programs, they would sit 
by the fireplace. “Tell me about 
the great ones,” he would say, and 
she would repeat all the things she 
remembered about Stinson and 
Benjamin and Straus. She never 
tired of discussing them. She would 
tell about Benjamin’s wife, Lisa, 
and try to describe the horror in 
Lisa’s young mind when the news 
went out that E. Mason Jamieson 
had been killed. She wanted him 
to learn as much as possible about 
his father’s death, knowing that 
soon the Agents would be after 
Earl. They were so clever, so per- 
sistent. She wanted him to be 
ready, not only in ways of avoiding 
their traps . but ready with a 
heart full of hate. 

Sometimes when she talked 
about her husband, Mrs. Jamieson 
wanted to stand up and scream at 
her son, “Hate, hate! Hate! You 
must learn to hate!” But she 
clenched her hands over her knit- 



48

ting, knowing that he would learn 
it faster if she avoided the word. 

' 1 1 HE winter passed, and the next 

summer, and two more sum- 
mers. 

Earl was ready for college. They 
had successfully kept their secret. 
They had been vigilant in every de- 
tail. Earl referred to the “damn 
Agents” now with a curl of his lip. 
They had been successful in con- 
tacting other Konvs, and some- 
times visited them at a remote ren- 
dezvous. 

“When you have finished col- 
lege,” Mrs. Jamieson told her son, 
“we will go to Centaurus.” 

“Why not now?” 

“Because when you get there 
they will need men who can con- 
tribute to the development of the 
planet. Stinson is a physicist, Ben- 
jamin a metallurgist, Straus a doc- 
tor. But Straus is an old man by 
this time. A young doctor will be 
needed. Study hard, Earl. Learn 
all you can. Even the great ones get 
sick.” 

She did not mention her secret 
hope, that before they left Earth he 
would have fully avenged his 
father’s death. He was clever and 
intelligent 

He could kill many Agents. 

So she exhumed the money she 
had hidden more than ten years 
before. The house beside the Little 
Wolf river was sold. They found a 
modest bungalow within walking 

50 



distance of the University’s medi- 
cal school. Mrs. Jamieson furnished 
it carefully but, oddly, rather lav- 
ishly. 

This was her husband’s money 
she was spending now. It needed 
to last only a few years. Then they 
would leave Earth forever. 

A room was built on the east side 
of the bungalow, with its own pri- 
vate entrance. This was Earl’s room. 
Ostensibly the private entrance 
was for convenience due to the ir- 
regular hours of college students. 

It was also convenient for com- 
ing home late at night after Agent 
hunting. 

Mrs. Jamieson was becoming 
obvious. 

Excitement brought color to her 
cheeks when she thought of Earl 
facing one of them — a lean, cun- 
ning jaguar facing a fat, lazy bear. 
It was her notion that federal 
Agents were evil creatures, tools of 
a decadent, bloodthirsty society, 
living off the fat of the land. 

She painted the room herself, in 
soft, pastel colors. When it was fin- 
ished she showed Earl regally into 
the room, making a big joke of it. 

“Here you can study and relax, 
and have those bull sessions stu- 
dents are always having,” she said. 

“There will be no friends,” he an- 
swered, “not here. No Konvs will 
be at the university.” 

“Why not? Stinson selected only 
educated, intelligent people. When 
one dies the cylinder is taken and 
GALAXY 



adjusted to a new thought pattern 
— usually a person from the same 
family. I would say it is very likely 
that Konvs will be found here.” 

H E shook his head. “No. They 
knew we were coming, and no 
one said a word about others being 
here. I’m afraid we are alone.” 
‘Well, I think not,” she said firm- 
ly. “Anyway, the room will be com- 
fortable.” 

He shook his head again. “Why 
can’t I be in the house with you? 
There are two bedrooms.” 

She said quickly, “You can if 
you wish. I just thought you’d like 
being alone, at your age. Most boys 
do.” 

“I’m not like most boys, mother. 
The Konvs saw to that. Sometimes 
I’m sorry. Back in high school I 
used to wish I was like the others. 
Do you remember Lorane Peters?” 
His mother nodded. ‘Well, when 
we were seniors last year she liked 
me quite a lot. She didn’t say so, 
but I knew it. She would sit across 
the aisle from me, and sometimes 
when I saw how her hair fell over 
her face when she read, I wanted 
to lean over and whisper to her, 
‘Hey, Lorrie— ’ just as if I was hu- 
man — ‘can I take you to the bas- 
ketball game?’ ” 

Mrs. Jamieson turned to leave 
the room, but he stopped her. “You 
understand what I’m saying, don’t 
you?” 

“No, I don’t!” she said sharply. 
JAMIESON 



“You’re old enough to face reali- 
ties. You are a Konv. You always 
will be a Konv. Have you forgotten 
your own father?” 

She turned her back and 
slammed the door. Earl stood very 
still for a long time in the room that 
was to have been happy for him. 
She was crying just beyond the 
wall. 

Earl did not use the room that 
first year. He slept in the second 
bedroom. He did not mention his 
frustrated desires to be normal, not 
after the first attempt, but he per- 
sisted in his efforts to be so. Use of 
the cylinder was out of the ques- 
tion for them now, anyway. 

In the spring Mrs. Jamieson 
caught a virus cold which resulted 
in a long convalescence. Earl 
moved into the new bedroom. At 
first she thought he moved in an 
effort to please her because of the 
illness, but she soon grew aware of 
her mistake. 

One day he disappeared. 

1%/T RS. Jamieson was alarmed. 
-L” Had the Agents found him? 
She watched the papers daily for 
some word of Konvs being killed. 

The second day after his disap- 
pearance she found a small item. 
A Konv had raided the Agent’s of- 
fice in Stockholm, killing three, and 
getting killed himself. Mrs. Jamie- 
son dropped the paper immediately 
and went to Stockholm. She did not 
consider the risk. In Stockholm she 



51 



found clothes and made discreet in- 
quiries. The slain man had been a 
Finnish Konv, one of those left be- 
hind by Stinson as an undesirable. 
His wife had been killed by the 
Agents the week before. He had 
gone completely insane and made 
the raid singlehanded. Mrs. Jamie- 
son read the account of crimes com- 
mitted by the man and his wife, 
and determined to prevent Earl 
from making the mistake of taking 
on more than he could handle. 

When she arrived at her own 
home, Earl was in his room. 

“Where have you been?” she 
asked petulantly. 

“Oh, here and there.” 

“I thought you were involved in 
that fight in Stockholm.” 

He shook his head. 

She stood in the doorway and 
watched him leaning over his desk, 
attempting to write something on 
a sheet of paper. She was proud of 
his profile, tow-headed as a boy, 
handsome in a masculine way. He 
cracked his knuckles nervously. 

“What did you do?” she asked. 

Suddenly he flung the pencil 
down, jumped from his chair and 
paced the floor. “I talked to an 
Agent last night,” he said. 

‘Where?” 

“Bangkok.” 

Mrs. Jamieson had to sit down. 
Finally she was able to ask, “How 
did it happen?” 

“I broke into the office there to 
get at the records. He caught me.” 
52 



“What were you looking for?” 

“I wanted to learn the names of 
the men who killed Father.” He 
said the word strangely. He was 
unaccustomed to it. 

“Did you find them?” 

He pointed to the paper on his 
desk. Mrs. Jamieson, trembling, 
picked it up and read the names. 
Seeing them there, written like any 
other names would be written, 
made her furious. How could they? 
How could the names of murderers 
look like ordinary names? When 
she thought them in her mind, they 
even sounded like ordinary names 
—and they shouldn’t! She had al- 
ways thought that those names, if 
she ever saw them, would be filthy, 
unholy scratches on paper, evil 
sounds, like the rustle of bedclothes 
to a jealous lover listening at a 
keyhole. “Tom Palieu” didn’t sound 
evil; neither did “A1 Jonson.” She 
was shaken by this more than she 
would permit Earl to see. 

^ W HY did you want the 
** names?” 

“I don’t know,” he said. “Curiosi- 
ty, maybe, or a subconscious desire 
for revenge. I just wanted to see 
them.” 

“Tell me what happened! If an 
Agent saw you . well, either he 
killed you or you killed him. But 
you’re here alive.” 

“I didn’t kill him. That’s what 
seems so strange. And he didn’t try 
to kill me. We didn’t even fight. He 

GALAXY 



didn’t ask why I broke in without 
breaking the lock or even a win- 
dow. He seemed to know. He did 
ask what I was doing there, and 
who I was. I told him, and ... he 
helped me get the names. He asked 
where I lived. ‘None of your damn 
business,’ I told him. Then he said 
he didn’t blame me for not telling, 
that Konvs must fear Agents, and 
hate them. Then he said, ‘Do you 
know why we kill Konvs? We kill 
them because there is no prison cell 
in the world that will hold a Konv. 
When they break the law, we have 
no choice. It is a terrible thing, but 
must be done. We don’t want your 
secret; we only want law and order. 
There is room enough in the world 
for both of us.’” 

Mrs. Jamieson was furious. “And 
you believed him?” 

“I don’t know. I just know what 
he said — and that he let me go 
without trying to shoot me.” 

Mrs. Jamieson stopped on her 
way out of the room and laid a 
hand on his arm. “Your father 
would have been proud of you,” she 
said. “Soon you will learn the truth 
about the Agents.” 

Beyond the closed door, out of 
sight of her son, Mrs. Jamieson 
gave rein to the excitement that ran 
through her. He had wanted the 
names! He didn’t know why — not 
yet — but he would. “He’ll do it 
yet!” she whispered to the flowered 
wallpaper. She didn’t care that no 
one heard her. 

JAMIESON 



She didn’t know where the men 
were now, those who had killed 
her husband. They could be any- 
where. Agents moved from post to 
post; in ten years they might be 
scattered all over Earth. In the 
killing of Konvs, some cylinders 
might even be taken by Agents — 
and used by them, for the power 
and freedom the cylinders gave 
must be coveted even by them. And 
they were in the best position to 
gain them. She was consumed by 
fear that one or more of the men 
on Earl’s list might have acquired a 
cylinder and were now Konvs 
themselves. 

r I ’WO weeks later she read a 
news item saying that Tom 
Palieu had been killed by a Konv. 
The assassin’s identity was un- 
known, but agents were working on 
the case. 

She knew. She had found a gun 
in Earl’s desk. 

She took the paper into Earl’s 
room. “Did you do this?” 

He turned away from her. “It 
doesn’t matter whether I did or not. 
They will suspect me. His name 
was on the list.” 

“They will,” she agreed. “It 
doesn’t matter who the Konv is, 
now that an Agent has been killed. 
The one in Bangkok will tell them 
about you and the list of names, and 
it’s all they need.” 

“Well, what else can he do?” 
Earl asked. “After all, he is an 

53 



Agent. If one of them is killed, he 
will have to tell what he knows.” 
“You’re defending him? Why?” 
she cried. “Tell me why!” 

He removed her hand from his 
arm. Her nails were digging into 
his flesh. “I don’t know why. 
Mother, I’m sorry, but Agents are 
just people to me. I can’t hate them 
the way you do.” 

Mrs. Jamieson’s face colored, 
then drained white. 

Suddenly, with a wide, furious 
sweep of her hand, she slapped his 
face. So much strength and rage 
was in her arm that the blow al- 
most sent him spinning. They 
faced each other, she breathing 
hard from the exertion, Earl 
stunned immobile — not by the 
blow, but from the knowledge that 
she could hate so suddenly, vi- 
ciously. 

She controlled herself. “We must 
find a way to leave here,” she said, 
calmly. 

“They won’t find us.” 

“Oh, yes they will,” she said. 
“Don’t underestimate them. Agents 
are picked from the most intelli- 
gent people on Earth. It will be a 
small job for them. Don’t forget 
they know who you are. Even if 
you hadn’t been so stupid as to tell 
them, they’d know. They knew my 
pattern from the time your father 
was alive. They got yours when 
we were together years ago, teas- 
ing them. They linked your pat- 
tern with mine. They know that 
54 



your father and I had a son. Your 
birth was recorded. The only diffi- 
cult aspect of their job now is to 
find where you live, and it won’t 
be impossible. They will drive their 
cars through every city on Earth 
with those new detectors, until they 
pick up your pattern or mine. I’m 
afraid it’s time to leave Earth.” 

ARL sat down suddenly, “It’s 
just as well. I thought maybe 
some day I might hate them too, 
or learn to like them. But I can do 
neither, so I am halfway between, 
and no man can live this way.” 

She did not answer him. Finally 
he said, “It doesn’t make sense to 
you, does it?” 

“No, it doesn’t. This is not the 
time for such discussions, anyway. 
The Agents have their machines 
working at top speed, while we sit 
here and talk.” 

Suddenly they were not alone. 

No sound was generated by the 
man’s coming. One instant they 
were talking alone, the next he was 
here. Earl saw him first. He was a 
middle-aged man whose hair was 
completely white. He stood near 
the desk, easily, as if standing there 
were the most natural way to relax. 
He was entirely nude . but it 
seemed natural and right. 

Then Mrs. Jamieson saw him. 
“Benjamin!” she cried. “I knew 
someone would come.” 

He smiled. “This is your son?” 
“Yes,” she said. “We are ready.” 

GALAXY 



“I remember when you were 
born,” he said, and smiled in remi- 
niscence. “Your father was afraid 
you would be twins.” 

Earl said, ‘Why was my father 
killed?” 

“By mistake. Back in those days, 
like now, there were good Konvs 
and bad. One of those not selected 
by Stinson to join us was enraged, 
half crazy with envy. He killed two 
women there in Bangkok. The 
Agents thought Jamieson— I mean, 
your father — did it. Jamieson was 
the greatest man among us. It was 
he who first conceived the theory 
that there was a basic, underlying 
law in the operation of the cylin- 
ders. Even now, no one knows how 
the idea of love ties in with the 
Stinson Effect; but we do know 
that hate and greed as motivating 
forces can greatly minimize the 
cylinders’ power. That is why the 
undesirables with cylinders have 
never reached Centaurus.” 

Heavy steps sounded on the 
porch outside. 

‘We’d better hurry,” Mrs. Jamie- 
son said. 



Benjamin held out his hands. 
They took them, to increase the 
power of the cylinders. As the 
Agents pounded on the door, Mrs. 
Jamieson flicked one thought of 
hatred at them, but of course they 
did not hear her. Benjamin’s hands 
gripped tightly. 

Mrs. Jamieson slowly opened 
her eyes . 

She no longer felt the hands. She 
was still in the room! Benjamin and 
her son were gone. Her outstretched 
hands touched nothing. 

Her power was gone! 

The Agents stepped into the 
room over the broken door. She 
stared at them, then ran to Earl’s 
desk, fumbling for the gun. 

The Agents’ guns rattled. 

Love, Benjamin said, the great- 
est of these is love. Or did someone 
else say that? Someone, some- 
where, perhaps in another time, in 
some misty, forgotten chip of time 
long gone, in another frame of 
reference perhaps . 

Mrs. Jamieson could not remem- 
ber, before she died.

BY WILLY LEY 



THE MOON WORM 

T HE theme of this column 
has been suggested to me 
by the most unusual intro- 
duction I have received so far. 
The place was a small town in 
Tennessee, the occasion a dinner 
party preceding a lecture. 

One gentleman, upon learning 
my name, took me to meet his 
wife and introduced me as “the 
man who doesn’t believe any- 
thing.” While both his wife and 



56 



GALAXY 



I looked surprised, he continued: 
“He doesn’t think that there are 
any cosmic secrets in the Great 
Pyramid; he doesn’t believe that 
Atlantis ever existed; he doesn’t 
think that the Dalai Lama could 
have killed off the whole invad- 
ing Chinese communist army 
with a single magical gesture if 
he had wanted to use his powers. 
He also doesn’t think that the 
flying saucers are spaceships 
watching us. In short, he doesn’t 
think that there are any 
mysteries!” 

All this was stated with a fair 
amount of belligerence. Next 
day, looking out across the over- 
cast from an airplane window, I 
suddenly had the impression 
that this belligerence had been 
directed at the lady. But that 
was an afterthought (and pos- 
sibly a wrong one); at the mo- 
ment I had just replied politely 
that my disagreement with the 
stories about the Great Pyramid 
and Atlantis was due to the fact 
that I believe I know how they 
came to be written. I added that 
I am positive I had never said 
anything about the Dalai Lama 
and his alleged magical powers. 
There I had simply had to trust 
the news services, which reported 
that he did flee from the invaders 
and took something as prosaic as 
money with him. 

As for mysteries which are 
still left, I don’t have to “think,” 



as the gentleman phrased it. I 
know there are a number of them 
and they are good ones. They 
are fully documented, but at the 
same time they are as inexplic- 
able as if they were the merest 
hearsay. 

Here is a sampling. 

UYWTHEN,” the Samoans 
told the English traveler 
Powell, “this shrub is covered 
with blossoms [Powell knew that 
the blossoms, which he had seen 
before, would be bright scarlet 
and that the shrub bore the 
scientific name of Erythrina 
indica ] it is time to see whether 
the boats and the baskets are 
ready. Then, when the Sisi plant 
[related to the myrtle] blooms, 
we look for the Moon. Soon 
after, the Moon will be just 
above the horizon toward even- 
ing (west) at dawn. Ten days 
later we will have Mblalolo levu 
and a month after that Mblalolo 
lailai. You’ll see.” 

Powell noted that the island- 
er’s face was beaming in antici- 
pation when saying Mblalolo 
lailai. It was a big event for the 
Samoans as well as for the Fiji 
Islanders, these two feasts com- 
ing a month apart. The_ term 
“feast” is to be taken in its 
primitive meaning, an occasion 
where everybody present eats 
until nothing can possibly be 
stuffed inside any more.

Fig. 1: Palolo morning off Samoa, about 1890 
(From Kosmos, 1926, original artist unknown) 



It must be remembered here 
that these islands are in the 
southern hemisphere; though the 
two months in question are 
October and November, this was 
a spring festival. It might also 
be useful to state that the word 
levu means “little” or “minor” 
and the word lailai means “large” 
or “major.” The word Mblalolo, 
finally, was adapted by some- 
body, possibly by Powell, for 
Western tongues by changing it 
to palolo. 

During the night of the Mbla- 
lolo the Samoans did not go to 
sleep. Late, after midnight, they 
rowed out, but not very far. 
While the men handled the 
oars, the women had loosely 



woven baskets ready. Other 
women and boys who did not 
yet have adult status sat at the 
shore with their baskets. All of 
a sudden, at four A. M., the sea 
became alive. Wormlike shapes 
wiggled at the surface, as sud- 
denly as if they had been ejected 
by a submerged explosion. With- 
in less than ten minutes the 
surface was solidly covered with 
worm bodies, wiggling, squirm- 
ing, in steady motion. 

The girls scooped them into 
the boats with their baskets and 
everybody aboard — and ashore 
— started to eat. The worms 
were so thick that one did not 
even need a basket; just reaching 
into the water with bare hands 



would bring edible results. 

But only for an hour or so. 

At the end of that time the 
ocean would look cloudy, as if 
m ilk had been poured into it, 
but no more worms. The boats 
returned to shore with their 
catch; the gourmets preferred 
their worms baked in palm 
leaves. And countless runners 
were waiting ashore too, to carry 
baskets to those living farther in- 
land. On Samoa, as reported by 
a later investigator, the islanders 
had organized relays of runners 
fo get the delicacy inland just as 
fast as well-exercised legs could 
do it. 

These were the cultural as- 
pects, the two feast days, or 
rather nights in spring, based on 
the sudden appearance of an 
edible marine creature. 

The zoological aspects were 
not quite as simple. 

rpHAT the things which came 
to the surface in uncountable 
multitudes were worms was be- 
yond any doubt. In fact they 
were annelid worms, of the same 
general type as our earthworm, 
but a large marine version. They 
came in two colors. One was 
darkish green or bluish green; 
these were filled with eggs, 
literally to the bursting point, for 
that’s the way they disappeared 
an hour or so later, by bursting. 
The other kind was whitish or 



GALAXY 



yellowish or about the color of 
egg yolk. These contained the 
male sperm. 

As for the length of the worms, 
the reports were at first a bit 
confusing; any length between 
one inch and fourteen inches was 
reported. But it was soon re- 
alized that the shorter ones were 
literally pieces, segments broken 
off the bigger ones. 

So far things were nice and 
clear; the two Mblalolo nights 
were the mating periods of these 
worms. As the Samoans had said 
all along, the two mating nights 
were one month apart, but they 
did not fall on the same dates in 
successive years. Outside of these 
two mating nights, nobody had 
ever seen a Mblalolo. It obvi- 
ously lived at the bottom of the 
sea normally. 

The worm was first given a 
scientific name, Palolo viridis, 
the second word with reference 
to the green color of the egg- 
containing segments. A little 
later the scientific name was 
changed to Eunice viridis. It was 
quite clear from the outset that 
the sexes were very strictly sep- 
arated, each worm being either 
male or female. But the early 
observers reported with head- 
shaking that all the worms were 
headless. 

Samoa, at the time I am talk- 
ing about (ca. 1890), was still an 
independent kingdom with three

countries yielding a good deal of 
influence: the United States 

(which had leased the harbor of 
Pago Pago — pronounced Pango 
I Pango — ), Great Britain and 

Germany. In 1898 trouble de- 
veloped which led to the with- 
drawal of Great Britain and a 
partition of the Samoan islands 
between the United States and 
Germany.

plete specimen; the spawning break occurs 
where segments become roundish 



But before this political de 
velopment took place a Germai 
zoologist, Dr. Benedikt Fried 
lander, had arrived on the scene, 
His first attempt had been to 
find the palolo in its natura 
habitat and under pre-swarmint 
conditions. He fished for it a fail 
distance from the shore and at 
considerable depth. Of course he 
caught some marine worms but 
none of them was Palolo viridis 
While thinking about the equip, 
ment he would need to fish at 
even greater depths (and, logic, 
ally, still farther from shore) he 
talked to Samoans. 

Somewhat puzzled, he tolc 
after his return to Berlin tha 
the information coming from “at 
old woman” had been best — 
presumably he expected tha 
young and actively fishing mei 
should know most about it. The 
old woman told Dr. Friedlander 
that the worms lived in cracks ol 
the coral rock, not very deep and 
close to the shore. Benedikt 
Friedlander, willing to try every- 
thing once — he even tried the 
green palolo segments when they 
swarmed, reporting that they 
tasted like almost unsalted Rus 
sian caviar — had a number ol 
blocks of dead coral hauled up, 
Yes, there was Palolo viridis 
complete with head and up to 
about 40 inches long. 

The old woman had also told 
him that the worms in the coral 

GALAXY 



rock, if placed in pails of sea 
water, would swarm at the same 
time as the worms in the open. 
Friedlander was too busy to 
make the experiment but did not 
doubt the statement; he just 
stated honestly that he had not 
verified it. 

O NCE you had the complete 
worm (Fig. 2) many of the 
puzzles became quite clear. The 
worm as a whole does not swarm. 
The head and about the first fifth 
of its length stays quietly where 
it always lives. The latter part of 
the body, the portion containing 
the eggs or the sperm, is de- 
tached at the right moment, rises 
squirming to the surface and, 
after a while, bursts, thus uniting 
eggs and sperm. One segment of 
the worm population does this in 
October; this is the smaller 
group. The larger group (sus- 
pected to be the older worms) 
does it in November. Friedlander 
watched the Mblalolo lailai of 
November 16, 1897. 

Well, all this is admittedly 
somewhat weird, but the facts 
are established. What is the 
“mystery”? 

The mystery is the timing. 
The Samoans, as has been 
mentioned, looked for the Moon 
after the Sisi plant bloomed. 
Friedlander found that the first 
swarming occurred when the 
Moon was in its last quarter, 



after the first full moon in 
October. The second (and big- 
ger) swarming took place when 
the Moon was in its last quarter 
after full moon in November. 
Now these figures must not be 
understood as being approxima- 
tions. The palolo does not swarm 
“about a week after full moon,” 
but at the moment the Moon is 
in its last quarter, with a leeway 
to be measured in hours only. 

Nobody ftas been able to 
figure out why. 

It can’t be the light of the 
Moon. To begin with, the moon- 
light is obviously much stronger 
when the Moon is full, but 
nothing happens then. Moreover, 
the Mblalolo lailai watched by 
Friedlander happened to be a 
night with heavy cloud cover, 
and during the second part of 
that night rain poured unceas- 
ingly. It can’t be the tidal influ- 
ence. Again, that would be more 
pronounced at full moon. The 
great Swedish scientist Svante 
Arhhenius thought that it might 
have something to do with 
atmospheric electricity — the 
Samoans had said that some- 
times there had been thunder- 
storms during those nights. But 
more often there had been no 
thunderstorms. 

There is no use wasting space 
on the problem. We simply do 
not know. 

But since Friedlander’s day

we have found something else: 
a related worm with the same 
behavior, this time in the 
northern hemisphere and in the 
Atlantic. It is Eunice iucata of 
the island Loggerhead Key in 
the West Indies. It also swarms 
when the Moon is in its last 
quarter, but here it is the last 
quarter following the full moon 
in July. 

Because the numbers are 
smaller, it is not as spectacular as 
around Samoa and the Fiji 
Islands. But the performance is 
the same and the mystery of the 
timing is the same. 

SLOW LIGHTNING 

t 

J UST AS dictionaries and en- 
cyclopedias are in need of 
constant revision, our popular 
sayings should be amended too 
from time to time. The man who 
says “Everything that goes up 
must come down” should be 
obliged to add “unless it reaches 
escape velocity.” Likewise the 
man who says “with the speed of 
lightning” should make the pro- 
vision “but I don’t mean ball 
lightning.” 

Ball lightning may move as 
slowly as three inches per second. 
It may even stand still for a 
short time. Ball lightning is one 
of the things I have yet to see 
myself. I also have never seen a 
volcanic eruption, but this prob- 

62 



lem (if it prayed on my mind) 
could be easily solved by flying 
to the scene of an erupting 
volcano. Ball lightning is, as far 
as we know, pure chance. But I 
do know that my chance would 
be somewhat better in Europe 
north of the Alps. 

So many Americans have 
never even heard of ball light- 
ning because it happens to be 
very rare in North America, 
That a natural phenomenon 
should be rare in one area and 
not rare in another seems some- 
what incredible at first glance. 
But it is a fact, for example, that 
“twisters” are rare in northern 
Europe (and if they do occur 
they are quite weak compared 
to their American counterpart) 
and ball lightning, while by no 
means a frequent phenomenon in 
Europe, seems to be positively 
abundant compared to its rarity 
in the United States. 

Instead of describing ball 
lightning and how it behaves, let 
me give a condensed quotation 
of a case which took place in 
Paris just after noon on July 5, 
1852, and for which sworn 
statements were filed with the 
French Academy of Science. 

It was during the summer and 
for this reason the fireplace in 
the apartment was not in use. 
According to custom the front 
opening of the fireplace had been 
closed by a wooden frame to 

GALAXY 



which stout wrapping paper had 
been pasted. Likewise the curved 
stove pipe on top of the fireplace 
had been taken down and the 
round hole in the wall into which 
the stovepipe fitted had also 
been pasted over with wrapping 
paper. 

The apartment in the Rue St. 
Jacques, next to the Val-de- 
Grace Church, was located on 
the fourth floor and occupied by 
a tailor. He had finished lunch 
but remained seated at the table 
because there was a thunder- 
storm going on. Some time (not 
immediately) after a very strong 
thunderclap, the frame closing 
the fireplace was pushed out as 
if by a strong gust of wind. Then 
a fiery ball, the size of a human 
head, emerged from the opening 
and meandered slowly about the 
room, a few inches above the 
floor. The ball was brightly 
luminous but did not radiate any 
heat. 

It approached the tailor’s feet 
(“like a cat,” he said later) but 
the man did not wish to be 
touched. He pulled his feet back 
without rising from the chair 
and watched the ball which 
slowly moved around in the 
center of the room. Then it sud- 
denly rose to about one yard 
above the floor. It became 
slightly elongated and flew to the 
hole in the wall. The paper was 
peeled off without being dam- 

FOR YOUR INFORMATI 



aged in the process and the ball 
disappeared in the chimney. 
After it had climbed to the top 
of the chimney — very slowly 
— it exploded with a loud noise, 
destroying the top portion of the 
chimney. 

r I 'O SOMEBODY who reads 
such a description for the 
first time, all this sounds pretty 
far-fetched. But to anyone who 
is conversant with the behavior 
of ball lightning this is merely 
typical, as can easily be seen 
from another case, this time from 
Konigsberg, East Prussia. 

The owner of a beer garden 
outside the city, a Herr Babinski, 
rendered the following descrip- 
tion: “We had a strong thunder- 
storm during the early afternoon 
hours and my beer garden was 
hit by lightning which, however, 
did not cause any damage. Im- 
mediately afterward there ap- 
peared, at about my eye level, a 
reddish rotating ball approxi- 
mately 16 inches in diameter, in 
the open door of the restaurant 
kitchen. Since the other door of 
the kitchen was open too there 
was a considerable draft. The 
sphere, rotating all the time, 
passed quite a number of people, 
climbed up along the wiring of 
the electric bell, was then ap- 
parently caught by the draft, 
then moved along another elec- 
tric wire to the stable and ex- 

N 63 



ploded with a loud noise above 
the door of the stable.” 

That ball lightning likes to 
travel along a conductor is 
almost proverbial. One was seen 
on May 19, 1925, in the Dutch 
city of The Hague. It moved for 
a very considerable distance 
along a streetcar rail, then 
jumped into a transformer box 
and disappeared. 

A real estate owner in East 
Prussia, Reich by name, had the 
interesting experience of being 
pursued by ball lightning. In the 
evening of “the Day of Pentecost, 
1890, at 8 P.M.” Herr Reich 
drove his carriage along a 
country road lined on both sides 
by wire fences. His carriage was 
of the open type, with four 
rather large iron-rimmed wooden 
wheels, running on iron axles and 
normally drawn by two, but 
since this was in horse-breeding 
East Prussia, more likely by four 
horses. 

“The sky was covered with 
clouds, but it was not raining. 
Two very bright head-sized balls 
appeared on both wire fences, 
moving along the fences at the 
same rate as the carriage. Many 
sparks jumped from these balls 
to the carriage axles. The horses 
shied and increased their pace 
but the faster the carriage moved 
the faster the .fire balls moved 
until we came to the end of the 
wire fences. There both balls, 



collapsed into nothing, without 
an explosion but with a noise like 
crumbling a sheet of paper.” 

Finally a case which happened 
near the small town of Bischof- 
swerda in Saxony on April 29, 
1925, at half an hour after noon. 
It was one of the rare cases of 
a violent lightning ball which 
was described by many wit- 
nesses. 

Taking it chronologically, the 
first witness was a mailman by 
the name of Fasold who asserted 
that he had not known about 
ball lightning. He was on the 
road and saw “a grayish-black 
cloud from which something 
dangled which almost looked 
like a trouser leg. Suddenly 
something fell from this dangling 
trouser leg which looked like a 
golden beer barrel. This body 
landed near a telephone pole 
with a loud crash and I had the 
impression that it came apart, 
somewhat like emptying a bas- 
ket of potatoes. From this heap 
real lightning jumped and one 
of the strokes hit the school. I 
was so surprised that I can’t say 
whether the crash was followed 
by real thunder or not, but I 
know that it was raining a bit 
before and that a little hail fell 
afterward.” Mailman Fasold also 
stated that the trees looked for 
a short time like Christmas trees, 
as if they had candles at the tips 
of the twigs. 



T THE school they saw a 
lightning ball move along the 
telephone wire (later it turned 
out that it had first smashed a 
transformer box) traveling at 
about the rate of a briskly walk- 
ing man. The ball moved into 
the apartment of the teacher 
(which was part of the school 
building). The teacher (male) 
w as using the telephone and 
stated that the lightning ball 
threw him to the floor. The tele- 
phone itself was not damaged. 
The door to the teacher’s apart- 
ment had a glass pane; later it 
was found to have two holes both 
perfectly circular and clean. One 
of these two holes was the size of 
a silver dollar, the other that of 
a quarter (the German report 
mentions other coins, of course, 
but of the size of the American 
coins named) and it is thought 
that the bigger hole was that 
caused by the entry while the 
smaller one was caused on leav- 
ing, when the ball had expended 
some of its energy. Like other 
lightning balls, it moved along 
wires, but this one melted the 
wires into tiny spherules of 
metal. But it did not ignite in- 
flammable material in its direct 
path — also a common feature 
of all the reports, lightning balls 
have been known to melt down 
quarter-inch bronze rods, but 
nestle in excelsior without ignit- 
ing it — and then proceeded 



along a ceiling. It must have 
moved under the plaster, because 
the plaster was forced off. Then 
it broke through a wall and 
disappeared. 

Afterward additional dam- 
age was found, presumably 
caused before the lightning ball 
entered the school building. The 
telephone wire had been melted 
down for 700 feet of its length, 
several telephone poles, includ- 
ing a fifteen-foot support of 
angle iron, were splintered, a 
cable 2 V 2 feet below ground was 
severed as if with a stroke with 
a sharp axe, the trunk of a cherry 
tree was split and several men 
working near the road were 
thrown to the ground without 
harming them otherwise. And all 
this, as far as the witnesses could 
recall, without making any noise 
at all! 

The overall picture is that a 
rather large amount of electrical 
energy is concentrated in one 
spot, that the lightning ball pre- 
fers to follow electrical conduc- 
tors which it may or may not 
melt in the process, that it does 
not set fires and does not 
electrocute people. Several peo- 
ple have been touched by light- 
ning balls, much against their will 
and inclination, in most cases 
without experiencing any sensa- 
tion. Some people were thrown 
to the ground, but without other 
harm than that caused by the

fall itself. Most of the time the 
end of the ball is by way of an 
explosion which is described as 
sounding like the sharp crack of 
an enormous whip. But the dam- 
age caused by the explosion is 
minor. Often the balls just go 
out. In most cases the witnesses 
cannot tell where the ball came 
from. In a few cases it has been 
seen to fall from a cloud, but 
very slowly, as if its weight were 
negligible. In a few other cases 
witnesses think that it followed 
the path of a normal lightning 
stroke which preceded it. 

Sometimes lightning balls 
have appeared without an ac- 
companying thunderstorm. Most 
of them, however, were associ- 
ated with thunderstorms, though 
it is almost a rule that they 
appear at the end of the storm 
— the end for the area in ques- 
tion, that is. 

Now, how do they originate? 

Well, that’s the mystery in this 
case. 

A Norwegian engineer by the 
name of A. Nielson once ob- 
tained an artificial lightning ball 
by accident when short-circuiting 
a 12,000-volt generator. This 
ball rose in the air and then dis- 
appeared (dissipated?) — it 
may not have been a real light- 
ning ball but just a cloud of 
superheated air and metal vapor 
which happened to take on a 
spherical shape. 



OACK in 1954, the well-kno 
Soviet atomic scientist P. 



Kapitsa busied himself with 
theoretical study of ball light, 
ning. His reasoning is very inter, 
esting, though I have a feeling 
that it is not the answer. Acad- 
emician Kapitsa pointed out that 
the cloud resulting from an 
atomic explosion lasts a very 
short time in spite of its enorni. 
ous size. Such an explosion 
cloud consists of gases which 
Kapitsa assumes to be 100 per 
cent ionized. Ball lightning, 
which must consist at least 
partly of ionized gases, is known 
to last for a minute and longer, 
and its size, compared to that of 
an atomic explosion cloud, 
virtually microscopic. Hence, 
Kapitsa reasoned, the lightning 
ball must have a steady “energy 
income” during its lifetime. 
When this “energy income’ 
cut off, the ball shrivels into 
nothing; it just goes out. If the 
supply is cut off very suddenly 
the ball collapses, its collapse 
causing a shock wave which 
makes the sharp crack. The noise, 
then, would be that of an implo- 
sion rather than that of an 
explosion. (The nature of the 
sound is no clue as to which it 
is, unfortunately. Either an ex- 
plosion or an implosion can 
cause such a sharp crack.) 

Kapitsa’s guess as to what 
feeds the lightning ball for the

duration of its existence is 
natural radio waves, presumably 
generated by the storm cloud 
and reflected by the ground. A 
very interesting idea, but this is 
really explaining one unknown 
by another one. It seems logical 
that a thundercloud might gen- 
erate radio waves, but we don’t 
know to what extent. Kapitsa is 
too much of a scientist to insist 
that his idea is right just because 
it is his idea. His paper begins 
with the sentence: “The nature 
of ball lightning is not as yet 
understood.” 

But while I don’t think that 
Kapitsa’s reasoning, novel as it 
is, has solved the problem of the 
origin of ball lightning, he quoted 
a case reported in Nature (No. 
563, April 1952) where a light- 
ning ball entered the interior of an 
airplane flying at an altitude of 
9,200 feet. This is the first re- 
corded instance of high-altitude 
ball lightning that has come to 
my attention. But I have always 
suspected that high-altitude ball 
lightning exists. 

Naturally I have not quoted 
all the cases on record — they 
would fill a book. In fact, they 
do fill a book; it was written by 
Dr. Walther Brand in 1923 and 
published during the same year 
in Hamburg by the publisher 
Henri Grand. (Its title is Der 
Kugelblitz.) In reading through 
this book soon after it was 



published, I was impressed 
by the fact that only a small 
number were reported from flat 
land areas near sea level. Ball 
lightning seemed to occur much 
more frequently in mountainous 
areas, at least a thousand feet 
above sea level. I may add here 
that the only two eyewitness 
accounts I got in the United 
States conformed to this pattern: 
one came from a mountainous 
area in the East and the other 
from Denver. 

Assuming that ball lightning 
was more likely in a somewhat 
rarefied air, I wondered whether 
it might not occur fairly high up 
— say 10,000 feet — in free air. 
When, near the end of the 
Second World War, we got those 
reports about the so-called “foo 
fighters” — balls of light follow- 
ing our airplanes near their 
wingtips for long distance with- 
out ever doing anything — I 
immediately thought of the two 
lightning balls which had ac- 
companied the open carriage on 
the country road. 

Taking the same risk which 
Kapitsa took, namely of calling 
on one unknown to explain an- 
other one, I have held for a long 
time that the answer to many 
“flying saucers” is ball lightning 
in mid-air. Since we don’t know 
how ball lightning forms, one 
might even speculate whether 
the presence of the airplane is 



68 



GALAXY 



not one of the factors which 
causes it to form. 

But at least we do know that 
ball lightning exists. 

What we still have to learn is 
how it comes into existence. 

PINWHEELS 
UNDER WATER 

TN THE CASE of the palolo, 
we know everything except 
the reason behind the timing, or, 
better, the mechanism of the tim- 
ing. In (he case of ball lightning, 
we know that the phenomenon 
is electrical and we have a 
number of case histories, but do 
not know reasons or conditions 
for its occurrence. 

Our next mystery is one where 
we just know that it exists. It 
has been well described just 
once, in the January 1952 
issue of the United States Naval 
Institute Proceedings, by Com- 
mander J. R. Bodler USNR. 

Like a good seaman, Com- 
mander Bodler supplied all the 
detail: “Date, 14 November 1949, 
Time 1830 GMT, Position 26° 
17.5' N., 56° 51' E. Wind NW’ly 
force 1. Sea calm with slight 
surface ripples; no swell. Air 75° 
F., sea 83° F. Visibility: very 
good. A clear bright night with 
no moon. Course 157° T., speed 
through the water 11.6 knots, 
actual speed over the bottom ap- 
prox. 9 knots due to strong head 



current. At no time were any 
unusual deviations of the mag- 
netic compass observed.” 

In landman’s language this 
means that the vessel, bound for 
India, had come from some port 
on the Persian Gulf and was 
about to enter the Gulf of Oman. 
At that time the third mate 
called the skipper to the bridge. 
“About four points on the port 
bow, toward the coast of Iran, 
there was a luminous band which 
seemed to pulsate.” At first 
Commander Bodler thought that 
it was near the horizon; then it 
turned out that it was below the 
horizon, in the water. The lu- 
minous patch, which clearly pul- 
sated, happened to be on course 
of the vessel so that the two 
drew together. 

“At a distance of about a mile 
from the ship,” to quote Com- 
mander Bodler, “it was apparent 
that the disturbance was roughly 
circular in shape, about 1000 
to 1500 feet in diameter. The 
pulsations could now be seen to 
be caused by a revolving motion 
of the entire pattern about a 
rather ill-defined center; with 
streaks of light like the beams 
of searchlights, radiating out- 
ward from the center and re- 
volving (in a counterclockwise 
direction) like the spokes of a 
gigantic wheel.” 

A sketch drawn by Com- 
mander Bodler shows that the 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



69 



outer ends of the “spokes” lagged 
behind, as if whatever made up 
the spokes of the wheels moved 
with a nearly uniform speed, so 
that the extreme ends naturally 
lagged. 

“For several minutes the ves- 
sel occupied the approximate 
center of the phenomenon. 



Slightly curved bands of light 
crossed the bow, passed rapidly 
down the port side from bow to 
stern, and up the starboard side 
from aft, forward. The bands of 
luminance seemed to pass a 
given point at about half-second 
intervals. The central ‘hub’ of 
the phenomenon drew gradually 




Fig. 3: How Commander Bodler's phenomenon might have looked from an airplane

to starboard and passed aft; be- 
coming more and more distant 
on the starboard quarter. While 
it was still in sight, several miles 
astern and appearing, by this 
time, as a pulsating band of light, 
a repetition of the same manifes- 
tation appeared fine on the 
starboard bow. This was slightly 
smaller in area than the first, 
and a trifle less brilliant. 

“Approximately half an hour 
later, a third repetition of this 
manifestation was observed. The 
general characteristics, direction 
of rotation, etc., were the same as 
the others, but this one was much 
smaller and less brilliant. Its 
diameter was not over 800 to 
1000 feet and compared to the 
other two was unimpressive.” 

T CANNOT recall having read 
another report just like this. 
Some fifty years ago somebody 
whose name I don’t remember 
wrote a description of an especi- 
ally impressive example of phos- 
phorescence he had witnessed 
from board of a passenger liner 
bound from the Mediterranean 
for Yokohama. He wrote that 
sometimes it looked as if the ship 
were the center of a gigantic 
fireworks pinwheel — but such 
a comparison can well be made, 
as everybody knows who has 



seen it, without experiencing the 
phenomenon described by Com- 
mander Bodler. 

No, I don’t know the explana- 
tion, but the discussion of the 
palolo phenomenon made me 
think of another marine worm, 
the fire worms of Bermuda. Like 
the palolo, they come to the sur- 
face to spawn a few days after 
the full moon, but not with such 
precise timing, and several 
months in a row in midsummer 
and early fall. The females come 
to the surface first and circle 
around, emitting flashes of green- 
ish light. This attracts the males, 
which dart after them, also 
emitting flashes of light. Then 
they mate and burst open like 
the palolo — but the fire worms 
die because they take their heads 
along when swarming. 

It has been suggested that the 
much discussed light which 
Columbus saw during the night 
before landfall was not a native’s 
torch on the water, but fire 
worms in the water. It is, of 
course, possible that Commander 
Bodler’s observation has a sim- 
ilar explanation. But at the mo- 
ment this is just conjecture. We 
know of no marine organisms 
whatsoever which swarm in such 
a pattern.

O NE MORE city. The 
pattern went on. One 
more city to search for a 
man I did not know, whose face 
I would not recognize. I had no 
copy of either his fingerprints or 
encephalograph, or any other 
clue to his identity. 

Yet he had to be found. 

At one time he had been my 
best friend. His name was 
Howard Zealley then. He 
wouldn’t be using the same name 
now. 

And the “bug” in his brain 



would by this time have made 
him a stranger. 

There was only one way the 
job could be done: I had to 
make contact — even though I 
might not be aware of it at the 
time — reveal who I was, and 
hope he’d come out after me. 

I rented a room in a cheap 
hotel. But not so cheap that it 
wouldn’t have a grid connection 
with information service. 

I wrote my name big on the 
register: MAX CALOF. There 
was always the chance that he 



would see it. He would remember 
the name. 

The room was small, a stand- 
ard “living-in” cubicle. Which 
was all right. I didn’t intend to 
sleep here. I hadn’t slept in nine 
years now — a year before the 
chase began. I kicked off my 
saddle shoes and walked on 
stockinged feet to the vid coin 
slot and dropped in a half dollar. 

The screen flickered once and 
the face of a beautiful, smiling 
woman came into focus. “May I 
help you, sir?” she asked in a 



pleasant, very friendly voice. 

I realized that the woman was 
not actually speaking, as she ap- 
peared to be doing. She was 
merely a woman image, with her 
voice and facial expressions 
synchronized in some way with 
the word impulses coming from 
information central. 

T STRETCHED out on the bed, 
A folding the pillow under my 
head to have an unobstructed 
view of the screen. “Give me the 
names of the city’s two hundred 












most prominent male citizens,” 
I said. 

There was no sign of surprise 
on the woman face, but I got the 
usual expressive long pause from 
central. The request was unusual. 
Central relays always had 
trouble with the proper defini- 
tion of “prominent.” 

“Any particular category?” the 
woman image finally asked. 

“All categories,” I answered. 

Another pause. Even a me- 
chanical brain would take a bit 
of time to assemble that infor- 
mation, but get it I would. 

After a while the woman be- 
gan. “Edward Anderson. Russell 
Baker. Joseph Dillon. Francis 
. .” As her gently modulated 
voice went on, I closed my eyes, 
keeping my mind blank, letting 
each name pass without resist- 
ance through my consciousness. 
Sometimes a hunch came that 
way. There was no need to make 
a written list. I had total recall. 

I became aware that I had 
opened my shirt collar and that 
I was perspiring. I hadn’t noticed 
how hot the day was or that 
the room had no air conditioning. 
I took a minute to concentrate. 
The perspiration dried and my 
body adjusted itself to the room’s 
temperature and humidity. When 
I was comfortable again, I re- 
turned my attention to the 
woman voice. 

At the end of the reading, no 



name had stayed with me. I 
opened my eyes. “Eliminate all 
except those within the age 
range of twenty to forty,” I said. 
Zealley would be thirty-seven 
by now — but probably appear 
younger. “Got that?” 

“Yes sir.” 

“How many left?” I asked. 

“Sixty-four.” 

It was always a temptation to 
cut the list further. I was weary 
of the seemingly endless repeti- 
tion of the same routine and the 
frustrating lack of any results. 
Eight years is a long time to 
search for a man. Yet I could 
not afford to be careless. I was 
gambling everything on my hav- 
ing figured out the way Zealley’s 
mind operated, how he would 
act, where he would hide. When 
the woman finished speaking, I 
walked to the vid and switched it 
off. 

I noted by the wall clock that 
it was almost noon. I hadn’t had 
breakfast yet. In the back of my 
mind, as I ordered a meal, was 
the certainty that someday this 
•appetite too would grow sated 
and dull. There were so few 
satisfactions left . 

* I ''HE FIRST name on my list 
was Edward Anderson. The 
city’s mayor. It took me two 
hours to get into his office, and 
two minutes to be on my way 
out again. I had asked my ques- 



74 



GALAXY 



tions and met the usual blank 

response. 

On the street I spent another 
hour strolling through the shop- 
ping district. No shadower picked 
me up. 

Which pretty well eliminated 
Anderson — or anyone in close 
contact with him. 

Second name, Russell Baker. 
Industrialist. Minneapolis Min- 
ing & Allied Products. 

I got as far as his secretary, 
John Roesler. 

“What can I do for you?” 
Roesler asked. He was a big- 
boned, handsome man, with an 
air of sleepy indolence. He 
cleaned and trimmed his finger- 
nails with a small gold penknife. 

“I’d like to see Mr. Baker,” I 
said. 

“What about?” 

“Confidential business.” 

“No one gets in to see a man 
like Mr. Baker that easy. If they 
could, he’d be pestered by every 
crackpot in town.” 

This was as far as I was going 
to get. I had to make the best of 
it. “Will you give him a message 
then?” I asked. 

Roesler shrugged. “If I think 
he should have it.” 

“I would advise you to deliver 
it,” I said making my tone as 
impressive as possible. “If he 
doesn’t get it, you may be out 
of a job.” 

His eyebrows raised slightly. 



“Tell him,” I said, “that Max 
Calof wants to see him,” and 
spelled my last name for him. 

“And what should I say you 
want to see him about?” I had 
caught a slight breakT in Roesler’s 
composure. 

“About a mutual friend — 
Howard Zealley,” I replied. “I 
think he’ll be interested.” 

Roesler hid a yawn behind a 
well-manicured hand. “We’ll see,” 
he said, and I went back out. 

Twice within ten minutes I ob- 
served the same pale-faced youth 
trailing me, and my pulse gave 
a great racing bound. This could 
be it. 

I stopped and studied the 
men’s hats in a shop window. 
From the side of my eye I saw 
the youth stop also. He leaned 
against a traffic light stanchion 
and kicked idly at a scrap of 
paper on the sidewalk. 

I wandered through a depart- 
ment store, stopping to purchase 
a toothbrush and a handker- 
chief, and he followed, keeping 
always a discreet distance be- 
hind. My last doubt was removed. 
I returned to my hotel. With 
luck, the hunter would now be- 
come the hunted. 

In my room I pulled a grip 
from under the bed and took 
out a rubber-handled screwdriver 
and a pair of pliers, a pocket 
knife, several lengths of copper 
wire, and a small instrument in 



METAMORPHOSIS 



75 



a black case about the size of my 
fist. Climbing on a straight-back 
chair, I removed the frosted 
globe from the room’s center 
light. I bared the wires, care- 
fully spliced on two pieces of 
wire, connected the black box, 
and replaced the globe. 

I had a little more trouble 
with the electrical clock’s wiring, 
but at the end I was satisfied. The 
time was two-fifteen. I made my 
setting for three o’clock. Zealley 
should be here before then. If not, 
I could always set the timing 
back. 

There was nothing to do now 
except wait. 

TVTEARLY a half hour passed 
' from the time I finished my 
preparations, and I was begin- 
ning to think Zealley would be 
late, when the door of my com- 
partment was kicked savagely 
open. 

The man who followed the 
kick was lean and dark, with 
wavy brown hair combed meticu- 
lously into place. A bent nose 
dispelled any illusion of softness. 

I was disappointed. If this was 
Zealley, it was not at all the way 
I had expected him to look. I had 
thought he would be more 
polished perhaps, more intelligent, 
with more of the outward signs 
of success. 

This weighing I did with a 
fleeting glance, and passed to the 



two men who followed my first 
visitor: Roesler and the pale- 
faced youth. Roesler was wearing 
a yellow hat. 

I swung my legs over the side 
of the bed where I had been 
lying and sat up. “Come in,” I 
said. 

The sarcasm was not wasted 
on Roesler. He kept his gaze on 
me, but spoke to the two men 
with him. “Stay by the door, 
George,” he ordered the boy. 
“You, Steve,” he addressed the 
lean man, “get on the other side 
of him. Stay close.” He let him- 
self ease into the lounge chair 
behind him. 

I decided to stir things up a 
bit. “I see you brought a boy,” I 
said, nodding at the one by the 
door. “This might turn out to be 
a man’s job.” 

Roesler glanced aside at the 
youth, whose lips pulled away 
from his teeth and eyes filled with 
quick hate. He pulled a switch- 
blade knife from his pocket and 
snapped it open. 

I found myself making a swift 
reappraisal. The lad was not the 
simple hood type I had first 
judged him to be. There was a 
flat look about the wide whites 
of his eyes that warned of 
something apart from courage. 

“Not yet, George,” Roesler 
said, and his voice, though al- 
most gentle, stopped the boy be- 
fore he took a step. 



Roesler pulled his penknife 
from a coat pocket and began 
trimming his nails. 

“Someday you’re going to rim 
out of fingernails,” I said. 

Roesler laughed soundlessly, 
amused. 

I glanced unobtrusively at the 
clock. Ten minutes to three. 
Time passed slowly in a situation 
like this. 

Roesler regarded me specula- 
tively. “ Y ou don’t seem very 
nervous,” he said. 

“Should I be?” 

“I would think so,” he said. 
“If I were in your position, I 
think I’d be nervous.” 

“Would you?” 

“Take off your clothes,” he 
said, with no change of tone. 

I took in a long breath and 
began opening my shirt. Another 
glance at the clock told me I 
needed at least eight more 
minutes. I had to stall. 

TJOESLER made no attempt to 
hurry me. He was a man 
certain of his control of the 
situation. 

I kicked off my shorts, the last 
of my clothes, and for the first 
time felt ill at ease. Standing 
stripped to the raw before these 
men put me at a mental dis- 
advantage. I feared them only to 
the point of discretion, but I had 
lost a bit of my poise. I sat back 
on the edge of the bed and lit a 



cigarette, doing my best to ap- 
pear unconcerned. 

Roesler turned to the dark 
man. “The shade, Steve,” he 
directed. “Pull it down a minute.” 

Steve did as he was told. 

The fact that my skin glowed 
with a faint phosphorescent 
sheen in the semidarkness was 
no surprise to me. 

Roesler leaned forward and 
the penknife, which he had set 
on one knee, slipped off. With- 
out attention he caught it before 
it touched the floor. 

Which confirmed my original 
suspicion. No one had reflexes 
that fast — except Zealley — 
and myself. I had estimated 
him correctly then. He had been 
too clever to expose himself to 
any searcher; he had disdained 
the prestige he might have ac- 
quired, staying in the background, 
but in a position where he could 
observe any pursuer if and when 
he appeared. 

Roesler-Zealley had noted the 
brief play of understanding on 
my face and he nodded. “I had 
to be certain, Max,” he said. 
“You’ve changed too, you know.” 

Which was true. The mites in 
our veins had altered us both 
considerably through the years. 
We had developed some small 
empathy with them and they 
often performed as we wished. 
It was not that they could read 
our thoughts. Their activities 




76 



GALAXY 



METAMORPHOSIS 



77 



were probably only reactions to 
our emotional and glandular 
functions. Moreoyer, they acted 
as often in ways that suited their 
own designs, changing our body 
structures, and regulating- our 
metabolisms, seemingly at ran- 
dom. 

“What did you want with me, 
Max?” Zealley asked, still being 
very pleasant. “Did you come to 
join me in conquering the 
world?” 

He was being facetious and I 
did not answer him. He knew 
why I was here. 

Overhead a faint click came 
from the light globe, a sound that 
probably only I noticed, and I 
knew that my alarm had gone 
off. I judged it would take the 
police only a few minutes to 
reach here. 

“Or are you going to pretend 
that the medics have found a 
way to boil the bugs out of us?” 
Zealley asked. Did I detect a 
concealed pleading for just that 
assurance? 

I shook my head. “No, they 
haven’t found any way, Howard,” 
I obliterated the hope. 

“Good old Max.” Bitterness 
crept into his voice. “Faithful, 
selfless old Max. Going to save 
the world. Going to save the 
whole of humanity,” he amended 
expansively. 

He hadn’t changed too much. 
Sarcasm had always come natural 



with him, which made it no more 
likable. 






MIGHT have said dull, 



■H stupid, cloddish old Max. 
The words would have better 
matched the tone of his voice. At 
that, he might be right. The 
authorities back on our home 
world of New Nebraska had said 
pretty much the same thing, only 
more diplomatically. 

“You and Zealley are differ- 
ent,” I’d been told. “That was 
one of the reasons we made you 
a team, originally. Zealley is 
clever and imaginative, but 
basically an egotist. A to-hell- 
with-the-other-fellow character. 
Fortunately, you’re not like him. 
You’re a man who accepts his 
responsibilities, a man with a 
strong sense of duty. We know 
we can trust you.” Whether it 
was actually trust or only that 
they had little choice, I had not 
let myself decide. 

“We had such high hopes.” 
Zealley was reminiscing, speaking 
more to himself than to me. 

We had. We’d been a two-man 
survey crew, mapping out new 
territory for the future expansion 
of the human race. On a world 
listed only as TR768-L-14 on the 
star maps, we had run into 
disaster. We found the planet un- 
fit for human habitation, but not 
before we’d been bitten several 
times by things we never did see. 



No infection had resulted and 
we thought little about it, until 
w e were a good part of the way 
home. Gradually then we noticed 
a quickening of our sensory 
processes, a well-being of body 
too pronounced to be normal. 
During the next several weeks of 
flight, Zealley wrote a historical 
novel that I was certain would 
turn out to be a classic. I found 
myself mastering, without diffi- 
culty, higher math, which had 
always been beyond me before. 

At the end of the third month 
we stopped needing sleep. Dur- 
ing the days and nights that fol- 
lowed we conversed brilliantly on 
subjects that had not interested 
us before, and the depth of which 
we couldn’t have fathomed if 
they had interested us. We were 
at a loss to explain the reason 
for the change, though we knew 
it tied in somehow with our stay 
on TR768-L-14, and probably 
with the things that had bitten 
us. The cause was of secondary 
importance; the marvel of the 
reality was what intrigued us. 
We looked forward with poorly 
restrained excitement to display- 
ing our new mental and physical 
dexterity. 



GALAXY 



1 



TTHE Space Bureau authorities 
were every bit as impressed 
as we had anticipated. The 
medics readily found that we 
had been infested by a germ, 



METAMORPHOSIS 



but by a benevolent germ, a true 
symbiote. That discovery was 
followed by months of tests and 
examinations. 

Between sessions with our own 
medics and laboratory men and 
various visiting specialists, we 
amused ourselves by showing our 
new abilities. At least a dozen 
times a day I had to put someone 
down in an arm .wrestle. Even 
when they devised a way to pit 
two against me at a time, I had 
little difficulty besting them. 

Zealley’s displays tended to- 
ward the more flamboyant. One 
of the tricks he delighted in was 
taking a razor blade, and, while 
his audience watched with re- 
pelled fascination, cut a long gash 
in his forearm. For an instant 
the blood would ebb out, then 
quickly clot and cease to flow. 
The next day he would show 
them the arm, where a thin red 
line at the most would remain to 
mark where the wound had been. 

Apparently Zealley’s reminisc- 
ing had kept pace with my own. 
“It seems such a shame, doesn’t 
it, Max?” he asked. He was 
genuinely sad. 

So was I. 

Test results and theories de- 
veloped fast in those early days. 
The findings showed that the 
symbiotes repaired damage and 
faults in our systems and pro- 
tected us against disease. It was 
even hazarded that they would 



78 



79 



prolong our lives indefinitely. 

Yet we were warned against 
complacency. The bug — we al- 
ways spoke of it in the singular, 
even though we knew the 
original mites had spawned in 
our blood streams — could not 
act quickly enough to save our 
lives in the event of major 
damage to essential organs or 
the brain. Also, we could drown. 
Or we could die in a fall from a 



great height. Or starve to death. 

The first intimation we had 
that all was not well had started 
as a rumor. Two of the staff 
biochemists had been experi- 
menting with transplants of the 
bugs in fruit flies. They had 
turned up something sensational. 

Zealley was not present when 
I received the disastrous news. 
At the end of what would 
normally be a twenty- or thirty- 



year cycle — the chemists were 
not able to estimate it any 
closer — the symbiotes evolved 
into tiny winged insects. 

At that stage they acquired 
size and flying strength by de- 
vouring the tissues of their hosts. 

In twenty or thirty years, then, 
our benign cohabitants would kill 
us — and spread out by the 
millions to infest other available 
animal life. Unless they were de- 



stroyed, not only would Zealley 
and I die, but all humanity on 
all the worlds would face the 
prospect of becoming infested. 

Zealley must have surmised 
what was coming. He had dis- 
appeared a week earlier. Before 
he left, I had noticed considerable 
change in our body and facial 
features. He would very soon be 
impossible to identify. 

The only lead the authorities 




ever got on him was that he 
had fled to Earth. At that par- 
ticular time Earth and New 
Nebraska were involved in one 
of the more serious interworld 
bickerings. Citizens of each were 
denied admittance to the other, 
which was probably the reason 
Zealley had chosen Earth as a 
haven. 

New Nebraska’s authorities 
called me in and briefed me on 
what I was to do. They were able 
to smuggle me to Earth with 
forged papers that identified me 
as a citizen of another planet. 

Zealley had to be found — 
and I was their one hope. 

64'V :r OU HAVE some interest 
in that clock?” Zealley’s 
words jarred me out of my re- 
trospection. Silently I cursed my- 
self for letting my thoughts and 
eyes stray. I was dismayed, too, 
to find that only a few minutes 
had passed since I’d last looked. 
Even so, the police were taking 
longer than I had calculated. 

Zealley abandoned all pre- 
tense of joviality. “Now, George,” 
he said to the pale-faced youth, 
who still stood by the door with 
his knife in his hand. 

The boy started toward me 
and I tensed, shifting my feet to 
face him. Something crashed 
against my right temple and only 
then did I remember Steve, the 
man behind me. 



The force of the blow knocked 
me sideways but not unconscious. 
I started to turn and a second 
glancing blow split the skin 
across my forehead. I slid off the 
bed on the side away from him. 

I retained just enough control 
of my faculties to get to my feet 
as the youth reached me and to 
grab him in a bear hug, but not 
fast enough to keep the long 
blade of his knife from ripping 
into my stomach. 

The symbiote, though able to 
repair damage, was not able to 
block pain. The bite of the knife 
clenched my muscles in a spasm 
of agony, and dimly I heard the 
youth give a grunt of distress as 
my arms squeezed and bent him 
back at the waist. 

Something landed on my foot 
— his knife. With blackness clos- 
ing in, my arms lost their 
strength and I slid down his 
body. 

I blanked out, but only for an 
instant. The kid had fallen with 
me and my hands clutched his 
ankles as I fought to stay con- 
scious. I stood up, still holding 
his ankles. Putting everything I 
had into the effort, I swung him 
around and sent him crashing 
into Steve, who was just rounding 
the foot of the bed. They went 
down together. 

I gasped in air, clutching the 
gash in my stomach with hands 
that were sticky and wet with 



82 



GALAXY 



blood. I turned toward Zealley. 
He was still seated in his chair, 
still smiling. One hand, resting 
negligently in his lap, held a 
snub-nosed pistol. 

He could have killed me any 
time before this, but he had 
wanted the fun of watching me 
fight for my life. He opened his 
mouth to say something but 
closed it abruptly as someone 
pounded at the door. 

“Come in!” I shouted through 
the froth in my mouth. 

“Damn you,” Zealley said 
softly. He wiped the pistol on 
his trousers and slid it across the 
floor away from him. 

The door burst inward. 

“These men tried to kill me,” 
I told the two police officers. 

'TE ALLEY’S bland features 
^simulated surprise. “I?” he 
asked. “I heard noise in here as 
I was passing in the hall. I came 
in to see what the trouble was.” 

“He’s lying,” I said as the 
policemen turned inquiringly to- 
ward me. “He’s with them.” 

Zealley shook his head sadly. 
“He must be delirious — ” he 
began, but the evidence was all 
on my side. 

“Shut up!” one of the officers 
said, grabbing him by the shirt 
front and jerking him to his feet. 

I had started dressing imme- 
diately. I wanted to hide the 
wound in my stomach. It burned, 



but I kept my face blank. 

Zealley was silent now. If I 
had been just superficially 
wounded, his bluff would have 
worked — I’d have healed right 
there and then. I hadn’t, so he 
had to wait for developments. I 
hoped I could give him some. 

While one of the officers 
worked to revive the youth — 
the thug named Steve was al- 
ready on his feet — I went to 
the bowl in the alcove and washed 
the blood off my hands and 
stomach. 

They had the kid upright when 
I turned around. “Are you hurt 
bad?” the policeman holding 
Zealley asked me. 

“Not too bad.” I managed to 
keep my voice steady. “I’ll be 
all right until you can send an 
ambulance.” 

He stood uncertainly for a 
moment. “I don’t like to leave 
you alone, but I can put in a 
call from our cruiser. The 
ambulance should get here 
within ten minutes.” 

“I’ll be OK,” I said. 

The sound of the closing door 
was the only way I had to know 
they were gone. For the past half 
minute, my tight grip on the bed 
headboard was all that held me 
erect. Now the starch went out of 
my body and I crumpled to the 
floor. 

This time I did not blank out, 
but lay twisted and tight, waiting 



METAMORPHOSIS 



83 



for the pain to stop — or to kill 
me. 

A small easing of the torment 
came and I forced myself to 
relax. I was able now to steel 
my mind against the racking 
spasms and pull myself to my 
feet. I was not at all safe yet; 
even if I was not mortally 
wounded, it would take the 
symbiote hours to repair the 
damage. 

I managed to pull on my 
clothes with numbed, awkward 
fingers and get out of the room 
before the ambulance arrived. I 
took with me only my grip. I 
would still need that. 

There was small chance that 
the police could hold Zealley. He 
would probably be free on bail 
this same afternoon. 

The odds were against me. I 
was fighting in Zealley’s own 
back yard, wounded and entirely 
alone, while he must have been 
prepared for this contingency for 
years. But I had succeeded in 
the first part of my plan. I had 
found out who he was, and I had 
put him in a position where he 
could not use his superior re- 
sources, for a time at least. Now 
I had to get to him before he was 
able to mobilize those resources. 

TN THE street, I had a violent 

attack of cramps in my upper 
diaphragm, and I got down on 
one knee and made a pretense 



of adjusting a shoe strap as J 
fought the torment. Perspiration 
gathered in clammy globules all 
over my body. When the pain 
left, I rose and pushed grimly on. 

Opposite Minneapolis Mining’s 
main offices, and a quarter of a 
block down, I found the type of 
commercial building I was look- 
ing for, and went in and sought 
out the building superintendent. 

“Do you have an office for 
rent on one of the lower floors?” 

I asked him. “One that faces the 
front street?” 

“We have several,” he answered 
with professional courtesy. He 
thumbed through a row of cards 
and pulled out one with a small 
brown envelope attached. “Here’s 
a fine office on the sixth floor. It’s, 
only one room, but — ” 

“I’ll take a look at it,” I 
interrupted him. 

“Of course.” He tore open the 
small envelope and took out a 
brass key. “I’ll take you up.” 

“I’d rather go alone.” 

As he hesitated, I took out my 
billfold and separated' a hundred- 
dollar bill from two others of its 
kind and laid it on his desk. “I’ll 
leave a deposit — in case I 
should like it,” I said, taking the 
key from his hand. 

“I suppose it will be all right,” 
he murmured doubtfully. 

“Thank you,” I called back ; 
over my shoulder. “I may be a 
while. I want to look it over 



84 



GALAXY 



carefully.” I ignored the fact that 
he seemed to have more he 
wanted to say. 

The office was small, but that 
made little difference to me. 
There was a clear view of the 
street from the window. That was 
all I cared about. 

In one corner was a small 
packing case, left by the former 
tenant. I dragged it over by the 
window and sat down. From my 
grip I took a rifle barrel and 
stock and assembled them, and 
filled the magazine with ammu- 
nition. I kept part of my atten- 
tion on the building down the 
street while I worked. 

I hoped I had guessed right — 
that Zealley would get free of 
the police, and that he would 
return to his office. 

The day-shift workers had be- 
gun to pour from the Mining 
building before a taxi drew up to 
the curb and a man in a yellow 
hat alighted. 

Zealley had come. 

He was alone. I aligned the 
sights of my rifle on his head, 
waited until I had a clear shot, 
and squeezed the trigger. 

The yellow hat sprang upward 
and Zealley sank from sight 
among the hurrying workers. 

The job was done. 

TENDING a way back to New 
■*- Nebraska took me a year, for 
I no longer fitted my passport 



picture and description at all. 

“Except for the danger to 
others,” I said when I reported 
in, “I wouldn’t have bothered 
coming back.” 

“A good thing for you that you 
did bother to come back here,” 
I was told. 

The biochemists had gone on 
with their work through the 
years I’d searched for Zealley. 
They had learned that the 
symbiotes’ life cycle developed in 
three distinct stages: five years 
of propagation, fifteen years in 
the dormant aging process, an 
undetermined number of .years 
in the final form. 

If the blood of a carrier was 
replaced any time during the 
first five years, the bugs in the 
residual blood in the body be- 
gan to propagate again, delaying 
the aging process another five 
years. 

“In other words,” I was told, 
“we can control the symbiote. 
Mankind can reap the benefits — 
with not a single one of the 
dangers.” 

Except poor Zealley, I thought 
pityingly, but wonderingly. The 
hogs, the smart boys who have 
every angle figured in getting the 
jump on everybody else — how 
is it they never figure the last 
angle? 

He should have waited instead 
of grabbing.

ffT ALWAYS said we’d find 
I one of the them that was 
M fun,” remarked Brian. 
“There’s been entirely too much 
solemnity in the universe. Did 
you never panic on thinking of 
the multiplicity of systems?” 
“Never,” said Georgina. 

“Not even when, having set 
down a fine probability for the 
totality of worlds, you realized 
suddenly that you had to raise 
it by a dozen powers yet?” 
“What’s to panic?” 

“Not even when it comes over 
you, ‘This isn’t a joke; this is 
serious; every one of them is 
serious.’?” 

86 



“ ‘Cosmic intimidation,’ Belloc 
called it. And it does tend to 
minimize a person.” 

“And did you never hope that 
out of all that prodigality of 
worlds, one at least should have 
been made for fun? One should 
have been made by a wild child 
or a mixed-up goblin just to put 
the rest of them in proper per- 
spective, to deflate the pomposity 
of the cosmos.” 

“You believe this is it, Mr. 
Carroll?” 

“Yes. Bellota was made for 
fun. It is a joke, a caricature, a 
burlesque. It is a planet with 
baggy pants and a putty nose. It 
is a midget world with floppy 
shoes and a bull-roarer voice. It 



was designed to keep the cosmos 
from taking itself too seriously. 
The law of levity here conspires 
against the law of gravity.” 

“I never heard of the law of 
levity. And Mr. Phelan believes 
that he will soon have the ex- 
planation for the peculiar gravity 
here.” 

“The law of levity does not 
apply to you, Georgina. You are 
immune. But I spoke lightly.” 

The theory that Bellota was 
made for a joke had not been 
proved; no more were the other 
theories about it. But it was a 
sport, a whole barrelful of puz- 
zles, a place of interest all out 
of proportion to its size, eminently 
worthy of study. And the six of 
them had been set down there 
to study it. 

SOCIABILITY impels — and 
^ besides they weren’t a bad 
bunch at all. Meet them now, or 
miss them forever. They were six. 

1. John Hardy. Commander 
and commando. As capable a man 
as ever lived. A good-natured 
conglomerate of clanking iron 
who was always in control. A 
jack of all techniques, a dynamic 
optimist. He had the only laugh 
that never irritated, however 
often heard, and he handled 
danger cavalierly. He was a 
blue-eyed, red-headed giant, and 
his face was redder than his hair. 

2. William Malaquais (Uncle 



Billy) Cross. Engineer, machinist 
extraordinary, gadgeteer, theorist, 
arguefier, first mate, navigator, 
and balladier. Billy was a little 
older than the rest of them, but 
he hadn’t mellowed. He said that 
he was still a green and growing 
boy. 

3. Daniel Phelan. Geologist 
and cosmologist, and holder of 
heretical doctrines about field 
forces. “Phelan’s Corollary” may 
be known to you; and, if so, you 
must be both intrigued and 
frustrated by the inherent contra- 
dictions that prevented its ac- 
ceptance. A highly professional 
man in the domain of magnetism 
and gravity, he was also a low 
amateur rake and a determined 
wolf. A dude. Yet he could carry 
his share of the load. 

4. Margaret Cot. Artist and 
photographer, botanist and bac- 
teriologist. Full of chatter and a 
sort of charm. Better-looking than 
anyone deserves to be. Salty, 
really the newest thing in salinity. 
A little bit wanton. And a little 
kiddish. 

5. Brian Carroll. Naturalist. 
And natural. He had been hunt- 
ing for something all his life, but 
did not know what it was, and 
was not sure that he would know 
it. when he found it, but he 
hoped that it would be different. 
“O Lord,” he would pray, “how- 
ever it ends don’t let it have a 
pat ending. That I couldn’t 



GALAXY 



SNUFFLES 



87 



stand.” He believed that anything 
repeated was trite. And it was 
for that reason that there were 
pleasant surprises for him on 
Bellota. 

6. Georgina Chantal. Biologist 
and iceberg. But the capsule de- 
scription may be unjust. For she 
was more than biologist and much 
more than iceberg. Frosty only 
when frostiness was called for, 
she was always proper and often 
friendly. But she was no ' Margie 
Cot, and in contrast perhaps she 
was a little icy. 

Actually there wasn’t a bad 
apple in that basket. 

fT'HE MOST obvious peculiar- 
ity of Bellota was its gravity, 
which was half that of Earth’s, 
though the circumference of the 
globe was no more than a 
hundred miles. It was on account 
of this peculiarity that Daniel 
Phelan was on the little planet 
in the first place. For it was held 
by those who decide such things 
that there was a bare chance 
that he could find the answer; 
no one else had found it. His 
own idea was that his presence 
there was fruitless: he already 
had the answer to the gravity 
behavior of Bellota; it was con- 
tained in Phelan’s Corollary. 
Bellota was the only body that 
behaved as it should. It was the 
rest of the universe that was 
atypical. 



And in other ways Bellota was 
a joker. Fruits proved noisome 
and thorns succulent. Rinds and 
shells were edible and heart- 
meat was not. Proto-butterflies 
stung like hornets, and lizards 
secreted honeylike manna. And 
the water — the water was soda 
water — sheer carbonated soda 
water. 

If you wanted it any other 
way, you caught rain water, and 
this was so highly nitric that 
drinking it was something of an 
experience also; for the thunder 
storms there were excessive. 

No, they were not excessive, 
claimed Phelan, they were nor- 
mal. It was on all other atmo- 
spheric planets known that there 
was a srange deficiency of thunder 
showers. 

Here, at least, there was no 
deficiency: it rained about five 
minutes out of every fifteen, and 
the multi-colored lightning was 
omnipresent. In all their stay 
there, the party was never with- 
out the sound of thunder, near or 
distant, nor of the probe of 
lightning. For this reason there 
could be no true darkness there, 
not even between the flashes; 
there were flashes between the 
flashes. Here was meteorology 
concentrated, without dilution, 
without filler. 

“But it is always different,” 
said Georgina. “Every lightning 
flash is entirely different, just as 



every snowflake is different. Will 
it snow here?” 

“Certainly,” said Phelan. 
“Though it did not last night, 
it should tonight. Snow before 
midnight and fog by morning. 
After all, midnight and morning 
are only an hour apart.” 

At that time they had been on 
the planet only a few hours. 

“And here the cycle is normal,” 
said Phelan. “It is normal no- 
where else. It is natural for 
humans and all other creatures 
to sleep for two hours and to 
wake for two hours. That is the 
fundamental cycle. Much of our 
misbehavior and perversity 
comes from trying to adapt to 
the weird day-night cycle of 
whatever alien world we hap- 
pened to be borne on. Here within 
a week we will return to that nor- 
mal that we never knew before. 

“Within what kind of a week?” 
asked Hardy. 

“Within Bellota’s twenty-eight- 
hour week. And do you realize 
that the projected working week 
here would be just six and 
two-thirds hours? I always 
thought that that was long 
enough to work anyhow.” 

There were no seas there, only 
the soda-water lakes that covered 
a third of the . area. And there 
were flora and fauna that bur- 
lesqued more than they really re- 
sembled Earth’s and kindred 
worlds’. 



The trees were neither decidu- 
ous nor evergreen (though Brian 
Carroll said that they were 
ever-green), nor palm. They were 
trees as a cartoonist might draw 
them. And there were animals 
that made the whole idea of 
animals ridiculous. 

And there was Snuffles. 

SNUFFLES was a bear — pos- 
^ sibly — and of sorts. The bear 
is himself a caricature of animal- 
kind, somehow a giant dog, 
somehow a shaggy man, an ogre, 
and also a toy. And Snuffles was 
a caricature of a bear. 

Billy Cross tried to explain to 
them about bears. Billy was an 
old bear man. 

“It is the only animal that 
children dream of without hav- 
ing seen or been told about. 
Moncrief by his recall methods 
has studied thousands of early 
childhood dreams. Children uni- 
versally dream of bears, Tahitian 
children subject to no ursine in- 
fluence in themselves or their 
ancestry, Australian children, 
town tykes before they ever saw 
a bear toy. They dream of bears. 
The bear is the boogerman. Bears 
live in the attics of old childhood 
houses. They did in my own and 
in thousands of others. Their 
existence there is not of adult 
suggestion, but of innate child- 
hood knowledge. 

“But there is a duality about 



88 



GALAXY 



SNUFFLES 



89 



this boogerman. He is friendly 
and fascinating as well as 
frightening. The boogerman is 
not a story that adults tell to 
children. It is the only story that 
children tell to adults who have 
forgotten it.” 

“But how could you know?” 
asked Margie Cot. “I had no idea 
that little boys dreamed of bears. 
I thought that only girls did. 
And with us I had come to believe 
that the bear dreams symbolized 
grown man in his fundamental 
aspect, both fascinating and 
frightening.” 

“To you, Margie, everything 
symbolizes grown man in his 
fundamental aspect. Now the 
boogerman is also philologically 
interesting, being actually one of 
the less than two hundred Indo- 
European root words. Though 
Bog has come to mean God in 
the Slavic, yet the booger was 
earlier an animal-man demiurge, 
and the Sanscrit bhaga is not 
without this meaning. In the 
sense of a breaker, a smasher, it 
is in the Old Irish as bong, and 
the early Lithuanian as bangs. 
In the sense of a devourer, it 
survives in the Greek root phag, 
and as one who puts to flight it 
is in the Latin fug. We have, of 
course, the Welsh bwg, a ghost, 
and bogey has been used in the 
meaning of the devil. And we 
have bugbear, which rounds out 
the circuit.” 



“So you make God and the 
Bear and the Devil one,” said 
Georgina. 

“In many mythologies it was 
the bear who made the world," 
said John Hardy. “After that he 
did nothing distinguished. It was 
felt by his devotees that he had 
done enough.” 

Snuffles was not a bear exactly. 
He was a pseudo-ursine. He was 
big and clumsy, and bounced 
around on four legs, and then up 
on two. He was friendly, chillingly 
so, for he was huge. And he 
snuffled like some old track- 
eating train. 

He was a clown, but he seemed 
to observe the line that the 
visitors drew. He did not come 
really close, though often too 
close for comfort. He obeyed, or 
when he did not wish to obey, he 
pretended to misunderstand. He 
was the largest animal on 
Bellota, and there seemed to be 
only one of him. 

UW/BY DO we call him he?” 
” asked Brian Carroll, the 
naturalist. “Only surgery could 
tell for sure, but it appears that 
Snuffles has no sex at all. There 
is no Way I know of that he 
could reproduce. No wonder 
there is only one of him; the 
wonder is that there should be 
any at all. Where did he come 
from?” 

“That could be asked of any 



creature,” said Daniel Phelan, 
ixphe question is, where is he 
going? But he shows a certain 
sophistication in this. For it is 
only with primitives that toy 
animals (and he is a toy, you 
jcnow) are sexed. A modern 
teddy bear or a toy panda isn’t, 
jjor were the toys in the Euro- 
pean tradition except on the 
fringes (Tartary before the ninth 
century, Ireland before the fifth) 
since pre-classical times. But be- 
fore those times in its regions, 
and beyond its pale even today, 
the toy animals are totems and 
are sexed, exaggeratedly so.” 

“Yes, there is no doubt about 
it,” said Brian. “He does not have 
even the secondary characteristics 
of mammal, marsupial, or what 
you will. But he has character- 
istics enough of his own.” 

Snuffles was, among other 
things, a mimic. Should a book 
be left around, and they were a 
bookish bunch, he would take it 
in his forepaws and hold it as to 
read, and turn the pages, turn 
them singly and carefully. He 
could use his padded paws as 
hands. His claws were retractable 
and his digits projective. They 
were paws, or they were claws, or 
they were hands; and he had four 
of them. 

He unscrewed caps and he 
could use a can opener. He kept 
the visitors in firewood, once he 
understood that they had need 



of it, and that they wanted dry 
sticks of a certain size. He’d bite 
the sticks to length, stack them 
in small ricks, bind them with 
lianas, and carry them to the 
fire. He’d fetch water and put it 
on to boil. And he gathered bel- 
lotas by the bushel. 

Bellota means an acorn, and 
they had named the planet that 
from the profusion of edible 
fruit-nuts that looked very like 
the acorn. These were a delicacy 
that became a staple. 

And Snuffles could talk. All 
his noises were not alike. There 
was the “snokle, snokle, snokle” 
that meant he was in a good 
humor, as he normally was. 
There was a “snook, snook” and 
a “snoof.” There were others 
similar in vocables but widely 
varied in tone and timbre. Per- 
haps Billy Cross understood him 
best, but they all understood him 
a little. 

In only one thing did Snuffles 
become stubborn. He marked off 
a space, a wild old pile of rocks, 
and forbade them to enter its 
circle. He dug a trench around it 
and he roared and bared foot- 
long fangs if any dared cross the 
trench. Billy Cross said that 
Snuffles did this to save face; for 
Commander John Hardy had pre- 
viously forbidden Snuffles a cer- 
tain area, their supply dump and 
weapons center. Hardy had drawn 
a line around it with a mattock 



90 



GALAXY 



SNUFFLES 



91 



and made it clear that Snuffles 
should never cross that line. The 
creature understood at once, and 
he went and did likewise. 

T HE PARTY had been set 
down there for two Earth 
weeks — twelve Bellota weeks — 
to study the life of the planetoid, 
to classify, to take samples, tests, 
notes, and pictures; to hypothesize 
and to build a basis for theory. 
But they ventured hardly at all 
from their original campsite. 
There was such an amazing vari- 
ety of detail at hand that it would 
take many weeks even to begin 
to classify it. 

A feature there was the 
rapidity of enzyme and bacterial 
action. A good wine could be 
produced in four hours, and a 
fungus-cheese made from grub 
exudations in even less time. And 
in the new atmosphere thoughts 
also seemed to ferment rapidly. 

“Every person makes one 
major mistake in his life,” said 
John Hardy to them once. “Were 
it not for that, he would not have 
to die.” 

‘What?” quizzed Phelan. “Few 
die violently nowadays. How 
could all die for a mistake?” 
“Yet it’s a fact. Deaths are 
not really explained, for all the 
explanations of medicine. A 
death will be the result of one 
single much earlier rashness, of 
one weakening of the mind or 



body, or a crippling of the re- 
generative force. A person will 
be alive and vital. And one day 
he will make one mistake. In 
that moment the person begins 
to die. But if a man did not 
make that one mistake, he would 
not die.” 

“Poppycock,” said Daniel 
Phelan. 

“I wonder if you know the 
true meaning of ‘poppycock’?” 
asked Billy Cross. “It is popy- 
talk, opium-talk, the rambling 
of one under the narcotic. Now 
the element ‘cock’ in the word is 
not (as you would imagine) 
from either the Norwegian kok, 
a dung heap, nor from coquarde 
in the sense that Rabelaise uses 
it, but rather from — ” 

“Poppycock,” said Phelan 
again. He disliked Billy Cross’s 
practice of analyzing all words, 
and he denied his assertion that 
a man who uses a word without 
feeling its full value is a dealer 
in false coinage, in fact a liar. 

“But if a person dies only by 
making a mistake, how does an 
animal die?” asked Margie Cot 
“Does he also make a mistake?” 

“He makes the mistake of 
being an animal and not a man,” 
said Phelan. 

“There may be no clear line 
between animal and man,” Margie 
argued. 

“There is,” said Phelan, and 
three others agreed. 



“There is not,” said Billy Cross. 
“An animal is paradoxically a 
creature without an anima — 
without a soul,” said Phelan. 
“This comes oddly from me be- 
cause I also deny it to man in 
its usual connotation. But there 
j s a total difference, a line that 
the animal cannot cross, and did 
not cross. When we arrive at 
wherever we are going, he will 
still be skulking in his den.” 
“Here, at least, it is the oppo- 
site of that,” said Brian Carroll. 
“Snuffles sleeps in the open, and 
it is we who den.” 

I T WAS TRUE. Around their 
campsite, their supply dump 
and weapons center, there were 
three blind pockets, grottoes back 
in the rocks. Billy Cross, Daniel 
Phelan, and Margie Cot each had 
one of these, filled with the tools 
of their specialties. Here they 
worked and slept. And these were 
dens. 

John Hardy himself slept in 
the weapons center, inside the 
circle where Snuffles was for- 
bidden. And the hours that he 
did not sleep he kept guard. 
Hardy made a fetish of security. 
When he slept, or briefly wan- 
dered about the region, someone 
else must always take a turn at 
guard, weapon at hand. There 
was no relaxation of this, no 
exception, no chance of a mistake. 
And Snuffles, the animal, who 



SNUFFLES 



right out slept in the open (“Is 
it possible,” Brian asked himself, 
“that I am the only one who 
notices it? It is possible that it 
happens?”) did not get wet. It 
rained everywhere on that world. 
But it did not rain on Snuffles. 

“The joy of this place is that 
it is not pat,” said Brian Carroll. 
As previously noted, he hated 
anything that was pat. “We could 
be here for years and never see 
the end of the variety. With the 
insects there may be as many 
species as there are individuals. 
Each one could almost be re- 
garded as a sport, as if there 
were no standard to go by. The 
gravity here is cockeyed. Please 
don’t analyze the word, Billy; I 
doubt myself that it means 
rooster-eyed. The chemistry gives 
one a hopeful feeling. It uses the 
same building blocks as the 
chemistry elsewhere, but it is 
as if each of those blocks were 
just a little off. The lightning is 
excessive, as though whoever 
was using it had not yet tired of 
the novelty; I never tired of the 
novelty of lightning myself. And 
when this place ends, it will not 
have a pat ending. Other globes 
may turn to lava or cold cinders. 
Bellota will pop like a soap 
bubble, or sag like spaghetti, or 
turn into an exploding world of 
grasshoppers. But it won’t con- 
form. I love Bellota. And I do 
hate a pat ending.”

“There is an old precept of 
‘Know thyself,’ ” said Georgina 
Chantal. They talked a lot now, 
as they were often wakeful, not 
yet being accustomed to the 
short days and nights of Bellota. 
“Its variant is ‘Look within.’ 
Look within, but our eyes point 
outward! The only way we can 
see our faces is in a mirror or in 
a picture. Each of us has his 
mirror, and mine is more often 
the microscope. But we cannot 
see ourselves as we are until we 
see ourselves distorted. That is 
why Snuffles is also a mirror for 
all of us here. We can’t under- 
stand why we’re serious until we 
know why he’s funny.” 

“We may be the distortion and 
he the true image,” said Billy 
Cross. “He lacks jealousy and 
pomposity and greed and treach- 
ery — all the distortions.” 

“We do not know that he 
lacks them,” said Daniel Phelan. 

So they talked away the short 
days and nights on Bellota, and 
accumulated data. 



II 



"V|THEN IT happened, it hap- 
™ pened right in narrow day- 
light. The phrase was Brian’s, who 
hated a pat phrase. It happened 
right in the middle of the narrow 
two-hour Bellota day. 

All were awake and aware. John 




Hardy stood in the middle of the 
weapons center on alert guard 
with that rifle cradled in the 
crook of his arm. Billy and 
Daniel and Margaret were at 
work in their respective dens; 
and Brian and Georgina, who did 
not den, were gathering insects 
at the open lower end of the 
valley, but they had the center 
in their sight. 

There was an unusual flash of 
lightning, bright by even Bellota 
standards, and air snapped and 
crackled. And there was an un- 
usual sound from Snuffles, far 
removed from his usual “snokle, 
snokle” talk. 

And in a moment benignity 
seemed to drain away from that 
planet. 

Snuffles had before made as 
if to cross the line, and then 
scooted off, chortling in glee, 
which is perhaps why the careful 
John Hardy was not at first 
alarmed. 

Then Snuffles charged with a 
terrifying sound. 

But Hardy was not tricked en- 
tirely; it would be impossible for 
man or beast to trick him 
entirely. He had a split second, 
and was not one to waste time 
making a decision, and he was 
incapable of panic. What he did, 
he did of choice. And if it was a 
mistake, why, even the shrewdest 
decision goes into the books as a 
mistake if it fails. 



He was fond of Snuffles and he 
gambled that it would not be 
necessary to kill him. It was a 
heavy rifle; a shoulder shot 
should have turned the animal. 
If it did not, there would not be 
time for another shot. 

It did not, though, and there 
w as not. Commander John Hardy 
made one mistake and for that 
he died. He died uncommonly, 
and he did not die from the 
inside out, as meaner men do. 

It was ghastly, but it was over 
in an instant. Hardy’s head was 
smashed and his face nearly 
swiped off. His back was broken 
and his body almost sheared in 
two. The great creature, with the 
foot-long canines and claws like 
twenty long knives mangled him 
and crushed him and shook him 
like a red mop, and then let go. 

It may be that Brian Carroll 
realized most quickly the impli- 
cations. He called to Georgina to 
come out of the valley onto the 
plain below, and to come out 
fast. He realized that the other 
three still alive would not even 
be able to corpe out. 

INCONGRUOUSLY, a thing 
A that went through Brian Car- 
roll’s mind was a tirade of an 
ancient Confederate general 
against ancient General Grant, to 
the effect that the blundering 
fool had moved into a position 
that commanded both river and 



hill and blocked three valley 
mouths, and it could only be 
hoped that Grant would move 
along before he realized his ad- 
vantage. 

But Brian was under no such 
delusion. Snuffles realized his 
advantage; he occupied the 
supply dump and weapons center, 
and commanded the entrances to 
the three blind pockets that were 
the dens of Billy Cross and Daniel 
Phelan and Margie Cot. 

With one move, Snuffles had 
killed the leader, cornered three 
of the others, and cut off the 
remaining two from base weap- 
ons, to be hunted down later. 
There was nothing unintentional 
about it. Had he chosen another 
moment, when another than 
John Hardy was on guard, then 
Hardy alive would still somehow 
have been a threat to him, even 
weaponless. But, with Hardy 
dead, all the rest were no match 
for the animal. 

Brian and Georgina lingered 
on the edge of the plain to watch 
the other three, though they knew 
that their own lives depended on 
getting out of there. 

“Two could get away,” said 
Georgina, “if a third would make 
a rush for it and force Snuffles 
into another charge.” 

“But none of them will,” said 
Brian. “The third would die.” 

It was a game, but it couldn’t 
last long. Phelan whimpered and 



94 



GALAXY 



SNUFFLES 



95 




tried to climb the rock wall at 
t jje blind end of his pocket. 
Margie cajoled and told Snuffles 
how good friends they had always 
been, and wouldn’t he let her go? 
Billy Cross filled his pipe and lit 
it and sat down to wait it out. 

Phelan went first, and he died 
like a craven. But no one, not 
sure how he himself might die, 
should hold that overly against 
a man. 

Snuffles thundered in, cut 
him down in the middle of a 
scream, and rushed back to his 
commanding spot in the middle 
of the weapons center. 

Margie spread out her hands 
and began to cry, softly, not 
really in terror, when he attacked. 
The pseudo-bear broke her neck, 
but with a blow that was almost 
gentle in comparison with the 
others, and he scurried again to 
the center. 

And Billy Cross puffed on his 
pipe. “I hate to go like this, Snuff, 
old boy. In fact, I hate to go at 
all. If I made a mistake to die 
for, it was in being such a 
pleasant, trusting fellow. I won- 
der if you ever noticed, Snuff, 
what a fine, upstanding fellow I 
really am?” 

And that was the last thing 
Billy Cross ever said, for the big 
animal struck him dead with one 
tearing blow. And the smoke still 
drifted in the air from Billy’s 
pipe. 

N U F F L E S 



r | ''HEN it was like black thunder 
coming out of the valley after 
the other two, for that clumsy 
animal could move. They had a 
start on him, Brian and Georgina 
had, of a hundred yards. And 
soon their terror subsided to half- 
terror as they realized that the 
shoulder-shot bear animal could 
not catch them till they were 
exhausted. 

In a wild run, they could even 
increase their lead over him. But 
they would tire soon and they 
did not know when he would 
tire. He had herded them away 
from the campsite and the weap- 
ons. And they were trapped with 
him on a small planet. 

Till day’s end, and through 
the night, and next day (maybe 
five hours in all) he followed 
them until they could hardly 
keep going. Then they lost him, 
but in the dark did not know if 
he was close or not. And at dawn 
they saw him sitting up and 
watching them from a quarter of 
a mile away. 

But now the adversaries rested 
and watched. The animal may 
have stiffened up from his shot. 
The two humans were so weary 
that they did not intend to run on 
again till the last moment. 

“Do you think there is any 
chance that it was all a sudden 
fury and that he may become 
friendly again?” Georgina asked 
Brian.

“It was not a sudden fury. It 
was a series of very calculated 
moves.” 

“Do you think we could skirt 
around and beat him back to the 
weapons center?” 

“No. He has chosen a spot 
where he can see for miles. And 
he has the interceptor’s advantage 
— any angle we take has to be 
longer than his. We can’t beat 
him back and he knows it.” 

“Do you think he knows that 
the weapons are weapons?” 
“Yes.” 

“And that all our signal equip- 
ment is left at the center and 
that we can’t communicate?” 
“Yes.” 

“Do you think he’s smarter 
that we are?” 

“He was smarter in selecting 
his role. It is better to be the 
hunter than the hunted. But it 
isn’t unheard of for the hunted to 
outsmart the hunter.” 

“Brian, do you think you would 
have died as badly as Daniel or 
as well as Billy?” 

“No. No to both.” 

“I was always jealous of 
Margie, but I loved her at the 
end. She didn’t scream. She 
didn’t act scared. Brian, what 
will happen to us now?” 

“Possibly we will be saved in 
the nick of time by the Marines.” 
“I didn’t know they had them 
any more. Oh, you mean the ship. 
But that’s still a week away, 



Earth time. Do you think Snuffles 
knows it is to come back for us?” 
“Yes, he knows. I’m sure of 
that.” 

“Do you think he knows when 
it will come?” 

“Yes, I have the feeling that 
he knows that too.” 

“But will he be able to catch 
us before then?” 

“I believe that all parties con- 
cerned will play out the contest 
with one eye on the clock.” 

ONUFFLES had now developed 
^ a trick. At sundown of the 
short day, he would give a roar 
and come at them. And they 
would have to start their flight 
just as the dark commenced. They 
ran more noisily than he and he 
would always be able to follow 
them; but they could never be 
sure in the dark that he was 
following, or how closely. They 
would have to go at top panting, 
gasping, thumping speed for an 
hour and a half; then they would 
ease off for a little in the half 
hour before dawn. And in the 
daytime one of them had to 
watch while the other slept. But 
Snuffles could sleep as he would, 
and they were never able to slip 
away without his waking in- 
stantly. 

Moreover, he seemed to herd 
them through the fertile belt on 
their night runs and let them rest 
on the barrens in the daytime. 



jt wasn’t that food was really 
scarce; it was that it could only 
be gathered during time taken 
from flight and sleep and guard 
duty. 

They also came on a quantity 
of red fruit that had a weakening 
and dizzying effect on them, yet 
they could hardly leave it alone. 
There was a sort of bean sprout 
that had the same effect, and a 
nut, and a cereal grass whose 
seed they winnowed with their 
hands as they went along. 

‘This is a narcotic belt,” said 
Brian. “I wish we had the time 
to study it longer, and yet we 
may get all too much of studying 
it. We have no idea how far it 
goes, and this method of testing 
its products on ourselves may be 
an effective one, but dangerous.” 

From that time on, they were 
under the influence of the nar- 
cotics. They dreamed vividly 
while awake and walking. And 
they began to suffer hallucina- 
tions which they could not 
distinguish from reality. 

It was only a Bellota day or 
so after their dreaming began 
that Brian Carrol felt that the 
mind of Snuffles was speaking to 
him. Carroll was an intelligent 
amateur in that field and he 
put it to the tests; there are valid 
tests for it. And he concluded 
that it was hallucination and not 
telepathy. Still (and he could see 
it coming) there would be a time 



when he would accept his hallu- 
cination and believe that the 
ursine was talking to him. And 
that would signal that he was 
crazy and no longer able to 
evade death there. 

Carroll renounced (while he 
still had his wits) his future be- 
lief in the nonsense, just as a 
man put to torture may renounce 
anything he concedes or con- 
fesses or denies under duress. 

V7"ET, whatever frame it was 
placed in, Snuffles talked to 
him from a distance. “Why do 
you think me a bear because I 
am in a bear skin? I do not 
think you a man, though you are 
in a man skin. You may be a 
little less. And why do you be- 
lieve you will die more bravely 
than Daniel? The longer you 
run, the meaner will be your 
death. And you still do not know 
who I am?” 

“No,” said Brian Carroll aloud. 

“No what?” asked Georgina 
Chantal. 

“It seems that the bear is 
talking to me, that he has en- 
tered my mind.” 

“Me also. Could it be, or is it 
the narcotic fruit?” 

“It couldn’t be. It is hallucina- 
tion brought on by the narcotics, 
and tiredness from travel, and 
lack of sleep — and our shock at 
seeing our friends killed by a 
toy turned into a monster. There

are tests to distinguish telepathic 
reception from hallucination: ob- 
jective corroboration, impossible 
at this time (with Snuffles in his 
present mood) and probably im- 
possible at any time; sentient 
parallelism — surely uncertain, 
for I have more in common with 
millions of humans than with one 
pseudo-ursine; circumstantial va- 
lidity and point-for-point clarity 

— this is negative, for I know 
myself to be fevered and confused 
and my senses unreliable in other 
matters. By every test that can 
be made, the indication is that it 
is not telepathy, that it is hal- 
lucination.” 

“But there isn’t any way to be 
sure, is there, Brian?” 

“None, Georgina; no more than 
I can prove that it is not a troup 
of Boy Scouts around a campfire 
that is causing pain and burning 
in my gullet, that it is really the 
narcotic fruit or something else 
I have eaten conspiring with my 
weariness and apprehension to 
discomfort me. I cannot prove it 
is not Boy Scouts and I cannot 
prove it is not telepathy, but I 
consider both unlikely.” 

“I don’t think it is unlikely at 
all, Brian. I think that Snuffles is 
talking to me. When you get a 
little nuttier and tireder, then 
you’ll believe it too.” 

“Oh, yes — I’ll believe it then 

— but it won’t be true.” 

“It won’t matter if it’s true or 



not. Snuffles will have gained his 
point. Do you know that Snuffles 
is king of this world?” 

“No. What are you talking 
about?” 

“He just told me he was. He 
told me that if I would help him 
catch you, he would let me go. 
But I won’t do it. I have become 
fond of you, Brian. Did you 
know that I never did like men 
before?” 

“Yes. You were called the ice- 
berg.” 

“But now I like you very 
much.” 

“You have no one else left to 
like.” 

“It isn’t that. It’s the mood I’m 
in. And I won’t help Snuffles catch 
you unless he gives me very much 
better reasons for it.” 

T\amn the girl! If she believed 
-■-^Snuffles talked to her, then 
for all practical purposes he did 
And, however the idea of a trade 
for her life had been implantec 
in her mind, it would grow there. 

Now Snuffles talked to Brian 
Carroll again, and it was some- 
how a waste of time to intone 
the formality that it was hallu- 
cination only. 

“You still do not know what I 
am, but you will have to learn it 
before you die. Hardy knew it at 
the last minute. Cross guessed it 
from the first. Phelan still isn’t 
sure. He goes about and looks 






back at his body lying there, and 
be still isn’t sure. Some people 
are very hard to convince. But 
the girl knew it and she spread 
out her hands.” 

In his fever, that was the way 
the bear animal talked to him. 

They ate leaves now and buds. 
They would have no more of the 
narcotic fruits even if they had 
to starve. But narcosis left them 
slowly, and the pursuit of them 
tightened. 

It was just at sunset one day 
that disaster struck at Brian. The 
bear had near hypnotized him 
into immobility, talking inside his 
head. Georgina had started on 
before him and repeatedly called 
for him to follow, but for some 
reason he loitered. When Snuffles 
made his sudden sundown charge, 
there seemed no escaping him. 
Brian was trapped on a rim-rock. 
Georgina had already taken a 
winding path to the plain below. 
Brian hesitated, then held his 
ground for the bruin’s charge. He 
believed that he could draw 
Snuffles on, and then break to the 
left or the right at the last instant, 
and perhaps the animal would 
plunge over the cliff. 

But old Snuff modified but 
did not halt his charge at the last 
minute. He came in bottom-side 
first, like an elephant sliding 
bases, and he knocked Brian off 
the cliff. 

There are few really subjective 



accounts of dying, since most who 
die do not live to tell about it. 
But the way it goes is this: 

First one hangs in space; then 
he is charged by the madly ris- 
ing ground armed with trees and 
rocks and weapons. After that is 
a painful sleep, and much later 
a dazed wakening. 



Ill 

TTE was traveling upside down, 
that was sure, and roughly, 
though at a slow rate of speed. 
Perhaps that is the normal way 
for people to travel after they 
are dead. He was hung from the 
middle in an odd doubled-up 
manner, and seemed supported 
and borne along by something of 
a boatlike motion, yet of a 
certain resilience and strength 
that was more living than even 
a boat. It had a rough softness, 
this thing, and a pleasant fra- 
grance. 

But, though it was bright 
morning now, it was hard to get 
a good look at the thing with 
which he was in contact. All he 
could see was grass flowing slowly 
by, and heels. 

Heels? 

What was this all about? Heels 
and backs of calves, no more. 

He was being carried, carried 
slung like a sack over her 
shoulder by Georgina. For the

“Did any of you ever make a 
world? I tell you that there are 
a million things to remember all 
at once. And there can be no 
such thing as a bad world, since 
each of them is a triumph. 
Whether it was that I made the 
others and I forgot them is only 
a premise; or whether I will make 
them in the future, and they are 
only now talked of out of their 
proper time. But some of your 
own mythologies indicate that I 
made your own. 

“I would tell you more, only 
you would not understand it. But 
after I have conserved your 
matter, then you will know all 
these things.” 

UCNUFFLES is cranky with 
^me today,” said Georgina 
Chantal. “Is he also cranky with 
you?” 

“Yes,” said Brian Carroll. 

“He says that he made Bellota. 
Did he tell you that too? Do you 
believe it?” 

“He told me. I do not believe 
it. We are delirious. Snuffles can- 
not communicate.” 

“You keep saying that, but you 
aren’t sure. He told me that when 
he chews us up he will take a 
piece of me and a piece of you 
and chew them together and 
make a new thing, since we are 
belatedly taken with each other. 
Isn’t that nice?” 

“How cozy.” 



“I wonder why he made the 
grass so sharp, though. There is 
no reason for it to be like that.” 
“Why, and what?” 

“Snuffles. Why did he make 
the grass so sharp? My shoes are 
nearly gone and it’s killing me.” 
“Georgina hold onto what’s 
left of your mind. Snuffles did not 
make the grass or anything else. 
He is only an animal, and we 
are sick and walking in delirium.” 
So they walked on a while, 
for evening had come. Then the 
voice of Snuffles came again in- 
side the head of Brian. 

“How was I to know that the 
grass should not be sharp? Are 
not all pointed things sharp? 
Who would have guessed that it 
should be soft? If you had told 
me gently, and without shaming 
me, I would have changed it at 
once. Now I will not. Let it wound 
you!” 

So they lived with it, and 
continued on for several short 
days and nights. 

“Brian, do you think that 
Snuffles knows the world is 
round?” 

“If he made it, he must know 
it,” 

“Oh, yes, I had forgotten.” 
“Dammit, girl, I was being 
ironic! And you are now quite 
nutty, and I hardly less so. Of 
course he didn’t make it. And of 
course he doesn’t know that it’s 
round. He’s only an animal.” 



“Then we have an advantage 
back again.” 

‘Yes. I’d have noticed it before 
if I hadn’t been so confused. We 
are more than halfway around 
the little planet. He is no longer 
between us and our weapons 
center, but he behaves as though 
he thought he was. We have no 
more than forty miles to go to it. 
We will step up our pace, though 
gradually. Our old camp valley 
is prominent enough so that we 
could recognize it within several 
miles either way, and we can 
navigate that close. And if he 
seems to say in your mind that 
he is onto our trick, do not be- 
lieve him. The animal does not 
really talk to our minds.” 

OUT THEIR narcosis still in- 
** creased. “It isn’t a narcotic 
belt” said Brian. “It is a narcotic 
season on all Bellota — a built- 
in saturnalia. But we have not 
been able to enjoy the carnival.” 
“Snuffles shows up well as a 
carnival king, though, don’t you 
think? It is easier to believe in 
time of carnival that he made 
the cosmos. I went to the big 
carnival once in Nola when I 
was a little girl. There was a big 
bear wearing a crown on one of 
the floats, and I believe that he 
was king of the carnival. It wasn’t 
an ordinary bear. I am sure now 
that it represented Snuffles, 
though I was only six years old 



when I saw it. Do you think that 
Snuffles’ explanation of the law 
of gravity here is better than 
Phelan’s?” 

“More easily understandable 
at least than the corollary, and 
probably more honest. I always 
thought that the corollary also 
embraced a simple mathematical 
error and that Phelan stuck to 
it out of perversity.” 

“It is one thing to stick to an 
error. It is another to build a 
world to conform to it. Brian, do 
you know what hour it is?” 

“It is the three hundred and 
twelfth since we were set down.” 
“And they return for us at the 
three hundred and thirty-sixth. 
We will be back at our campsite 
and in control by then, won’t 
we?” 

“If we are ever to make it back 
and be in control, we should 
make it by then. Are you tired, 
Georgina?” 

“No. I will never again be 
tired. I have been walking in a 
dream too long for that. But I 
never felt more pleasurable than 
now. I look down at my feet 
which are a sorry mess, but they 
don’t seem to be my feet. Only 
a little while ago I felt sorry for 
a girl in such a state, and then 
I came to half realize that the 
girl was me. But the realization 
didn’t carry a lot of conviction. 
It doesn’t seem like me.” 

“I feel disembodied myself.

thing of the pleasant fragrance 
was Georgina Chantal. 

She set him down then. It was 
a very rough valley they were in, 
and he saw that they had traveled 
perhaps four miles from the base 
of the rim-rock; and Snuffles had 
settled down in the morning light 
a quarter of a mile behind them. 

“Georgina, did you carry me 
all night?” 

“Yes.” 

“How could you?” 

“I changed shoulders some- 
times. And you aren’t very 
heavy. This is only a half- 
gravity planet. Besides, I’m very 
strong. I could have carried you 
even on Earth.” 

“Why wasn’t I killed by the 
fall?” 

“Snuffles says he isn’t ready 
to kill you yet, that he could 
kill you any time he wanted to 
with the lightning or rock or 
poison berry. But you did hit 
terribly hard. I was surprised to 
be able to pick you up in one 
piece. And now Snuffles says that 
I have lost my last chance.” 
“How?” 

“Because I carried you away 
from him before he could get 
down the cliff in the dark. Now 
he says he will kill me too.” 
“Snuff is inconsistent. If he 
could kill me any instant with 
the lightning, why would he be 
angered if you carried me away 
from him?” 






the world, he had begun to guess 



“I thought of that too. But 
says he has his own reasons. And 
that lightning — do you know 
that it doesn’t lighten all the 
time everywhere on Bellota? 
Only in a big circle around 
Snuffles, as a tribute to him. I’ve 
noticed myself that when we get 
a big lead over him, we almost 
move clear out of the lightning 
sphere.” 

“Georgina, that animal doesn’t 
really talk to us. It is only our 
imaginations. It is not accurate 
to so personify it.” 

“It may not be accurate, but 
if that isn’t talk he puts out, then 
I don’t know talk. And a lot of 
his talk he makes come true. 
But I don’t care if he does kill 
me for saving you. I’m silly over 
you now.” 

“We are both of us silly, 
Georgina, from the condition we 
are in. But he can’t talk to us. 
He’s only an animal run amok. 
If it were anything else, it would 
mean that much of what we know 
is not so.” 

T>RIAN had the full effect of it 
one sunny afternoon a couple 
of Bellota days later. He was 
dozing and Georgina was on 
guard when Snuffles began to talk 
inside his head. 

“You insult me that you do 
not recognize my identity. When 
Hardy said that in many mythol- 
ogies it was the Bear who made 



who I was. I am the creator and 
l made the world. I have heard 
that there are other worlds be- 
sides Bellota, and I am not sure 
whether I made them or not. 
But if they are there, I must have 
made them. They could not have 
made themselves. And this I did 

make. 

“It isn’t an easy thing, or all 
0 f you would have made them, 
and you have not. And there is 
pride in creation that you could 
not understand. You said that 
Bellota was made for fun. It was 
not made for fun. I am the only 
one who knows why it was made, 
for I made it. And it is not a 
little planet; it is a grand planet. 
I waited for you to confess your 
error and be amazed at it. Since 
you did not, you will have to die. 

I made you, so I can kill you if 
I like. I must have made you, 
since I made all. And if I did 
not, then I made other things, 
red squirrels and white birds. 

“You have no idea of the 
achievement itself. I had very 
little to work with and no model 
or plans or previous experience. 
And I made mistakes. I would be 
the last to deny that. I miscal- 
culated the gravity, a simple 
mathematical error that anyone 
could make. The planet is too 
small for the gravity, but I had 
already embodied the calculated 
gravity in other works that I did 



not choose to undo, and I had 
no material to make a larger 
planet. So what I have made I 
have made, and it will continue 
so. An error, once it is embodied, 
becomes a new truth. 

“You may wonder why my 
birds have hair. I will confess it, 
I did not know how to make 
feathers, nor could you without 
template or typus. And you are 
puzzled that my butterflies sting 
and my hornets do not? But how 
was I to know that those fear- 
fully colored monsters should 
have been harmless? It ill befits 
one who has never made even the 
smallest — but why do I try to 
explain this to you? 

“You wonder if I am talking to 
you or if it is only a delusion of 
your mind. What is the differ- 
ence? How could there be any- 
thing in your mind if I did not 
put it there? And do not be 
afraid of dying. Remember that 
nothing is lost. When I have the 
pieces of you, I will use them to 
make other things. That is the 
law of conservation of matter as 
I understand it. 

“But do you know that the 
one thing desired by all is really 
praise? It is the impelling force, 
and a creator needs this more 
than anyone. Things and beings 
are made to give praise, and if 
they do not, they are destroyed 
again. You had every opportunity 
to give it, and instead you jeered.

But I don’t believe that this 
comical old body that I observe 
will carry me much farther.” 
“Snuffles is trying to talk to us.” 
“Yes, I feel him. No, dammit, 
Georgina, we will not give in to 
that nonsense. Snuffles is only a 
wounded old bear that is trail- 
ing us. But our hallucination is 
coming again. It will take a lot 
of theory to cover a dual 
hallucination.” 

“Hush, I want to hear what 
he says.” 

Then Snuffles began to talk 
inside the heads of the two of 
them. 

“If you know and do not tell 
me, then you are guilty of a 
peculiar affront. A maker cannot 
remember everything, and I had 
forgotten some of the things that 
I had made before. But we are 
coming on a new world now that 
is very like Bellota. Can it be 
that I have only repeated myself, 
and that I did not improve each 
time? These hills here I made 
once before. If you know, then 
you must tell me now. It may be 
that I cannot wait to chew your 
brains to find out about it. How 
will I ever make a better world 
if I make them all alike?” 

“He has forgotten that he made 
it round, Brian.” 

“Georgina, he did not make 
anything. It is our own minds 
trying to reassure us that he does 
not know we are ahead of him 



and going toward our weapons," 
“But how do we both hear the 
same thing if he isn’t talking to 
us?” 

“I don’t know. But I prefer it 
the way it is. I never did like 
easy answers.” 

r I 'HEN there came the evening 
when they were within sight 
of their original valley; and if 
they moved at full speed through 
the night, they should reac] 
their campsite very soon after] 
dawn. 

“But the weariness is begi] 
ning to creep up through the 
narcosis,” said Brian. “Now I’m 
desiring the effect that we tried 
to avoid before.” 

“But what has happened?” 

“I believe that the narcoticl 
period of the planet is over. Thi 
carnival is coming to an end.” 
“Do you know something, 
Brian? We did not have to go 
around the world at all. At any 
time we could have separated 
and outmaneuvered him. He 
could not have intercepted both 
of us going toward the weapons 
pile if we went different ways. 
But we could not bear to part.” 
“That is a woman’s explana- 
tion.” 

“Well, let’s see you find an- 
other one. You didn’t want to be 
parted from me, did you, Brian?” 
“No, I didn’t.” 

It was a rough, short night,

but it would be the last. They 
moved in the agony of a cosmic 
hangover. 

“I’ve become addicted,” said 
Brian, “and the fruit has lost its 
numbing properties. I don’t see 
how it is possible for anyone to 
be so tired.” 

“I’d carry you again if I 
weren’t collapsing myself.” 

“Dammit, you couldn’t! You’re 
only a girl!” 

“I am not only a girl! Nobody 
is only an anything. Our trouble 
here may have started with your 
thinking that Snuffles was only 
an animal, and he read your 
thoughts and was insulted.” 

“He did not read my thoughts. 
He is only an animal. And I will 
shoot his fuzzy hide full of holes 
when we get to our campsite. 
Let’s keep on with it and not 
take any chances of his catching 
or passing us in the dark.” 

“How could Phelan’s corollary 
apply to this planet and no other 
when he had never been here 
then?” 

“Because, as I often suspected, 
Phelan had a touch of the joker 
in him and he composed it 
sardonically.” 

“Then he made it for fun. And 
do you still think that Bellota 
was made for fun?” 

“The fun has developed a gro- 
tesque side to it. I am afraid I 
will have to put an end to a part 
of that fun. The dark is coming, 




and there is our campsite, and 
we are in the clear. I’ll make it 
before I drop if I have to bust 
a lung. There’s an elephant gu n 
with a blaster attachment that 
I’ll take to that fur-coated 
phony. We’re going to have bear 
steak for breakfast.” 



TTE ACHIEVED the campsite. 

He had reached the wobbly 
state, but he still ran. He was 
inside the circle and at the gun 
stack, when a roar like double 
thunder froze his ears and his 
entrails. 

He leaped back, fell, rolled, 
crawled, snaked his way out of 
reach; and the sudden shock of 
it bewildered him. 

And there was Snuffles sitting 
in the middle of the supply dump 
and smoking the pipe of Billy 
Cross. 

And when the words rattled 
inside Brian’s head again, how 
could he be sure that it was 
hallucination and not the bear 
talking to him? 

“You thought that I had for- 
gotten that Bellota was round? 
If you knew how much trouble I 
had making it as round as it is, 
you would know that I could 
never forget it.” 

Georgina came up, but fell to 
her knees in despair when she 
saw that Snuffles was there ahead 
of them. 

“I can’t run any more, Brian, 



. 






a nd I know that you can’t. I am 
down and I can never get up 
again. How soon will they get 
here?” 

“The Marines?” 

“Yes, the ship.” 

“Too late to help us. I used to 
wish they would be late just 
once. I am getting that wish, but it 
isn’t as amusing as I anticipated.” 

SNUFFLES KNOCKED out his 
pipe then, as a man would; and 
laid it carefully on a rock. Then 
he came out and killed them: 
Georgina, the friendly iceberg, 
and Brian, who did hate a pat 
ending. 

And Snuffes was still king of 
Bellota. 

THE REPORT of the ship read 
in part: 



“No explanation of the fact 
that no attempt seems to have 
been made to use the weapons, 
though two of the party were 
killed nearly a week later than 
the others. All were mangled by 
the huge pseudo-ursine which 
seems to have run amok from 
eating the local fruit, seasonally 
narcotic. Impossible to capture 
animal without unwarranted de- 
lay of takeoff time. Gravitational 
incongruity must await fuller 
classification of data.” 

THE NEXT world that Snuffles 
made embodied certain improve- 
ments, and he did correct the 
gravity error, but it still contained 
many elements of the grotesque. 
Perfection is a very long, very 
hard road.

P 



ENDLETON had been 
away from San Francisco 
over two months. The air- 
taxi left him at his place, 
he showered and shaved. 
Then he decided he would walk, 
down through Chinatown and 
over into North Beach, to Beth’s 
apartment. 

It was a warm Saturday after- 
noon and he unbuttoned his dac- 
ron blazer a block or so into 
j Chinatown. He smiled as he 
wandered by the bright restau- 
rants and shops, the rows of 
ivory Buddhas in window after 
window. On one corner Pendle- 
ton stopped and took a deep 
breath, watching a scattering of 
tourists taking pictures of each 



other. Someone had lost a half 
dozen fortune cookies on the 
sidewalk and they crackled and 
spread fragments and fortunes as 
people passed. 

While he was waiting for a 
signal to change, three small 
Chinese boys charged a fourth 
who had ducked around Pendle- 
ton. They all ran around the 
corner and Pendleton looked 
after them. There was an old 
curio and toy shop there. He 
went toward its streaked win- 
dow, trying to identify the ob- 
jects. Some kind of procession 
of tin soldiers made up the main 
display. The door of the shop 
opened and an old man with a 
flared white beard came out. His 



dark suit hung loose on him and 
his tie was coming untied as he 
hurried away. 

The old man brushed by Pen- 
dleton, nudging him. “Many 
pardons,” he said, cutting across 
the street. He ran downhill, 
weaving a little, and into an 
alley. 

The bells over the toy shop 
door rattled again. “Stop, thief!” 
shouted the fat Chinese, who 
came running up to Pendleton. 
The man shouted again and 
stopped on the corner, his hands 
on his hips, looking. 

Pendleton crossed the street 
and turned down the alley the 
old man had used. This would 
cut off a block of the way to 



111 




Beth’s. He had kept quiet about 
the thief because he didn’t want 
to get involved in a lot of delay- 
ing questioning. 

H ALFWAY down the alley he 
saw an arm dangling out of 
a garbage can. Pendleton blinked 
and approached the shadowed 
area around the can. He flipped 
the lid up and the coat sleeve 
that had been tangled on the 
can edge slipped free and 
dropped into the can. If the old 
man was wandering around 
naked, they shouldn’t have much 
trouble catching him. 

Pendleton liked the pre-quake 
apartment house Beth lived in. 
In almost any weather he liked 
to see its narrow brown wood 
front waiting there in the mid- 
dle of the block. He smiled as 
a big blue-gray gull flew low 
overhead and then circled up 
and away behind Beth’s build- 
ing. Pendleton took the rough 
steps in twos and threes and 
swung at Beth’s bell. There was 
a folded note for him glued on 
her mail box lid with Scotch 
tape. It told him she might be 
delayed a bit and to get her keys 
from under the rubber-plant pot 
on the porch and let himself in. 
He did that, thinking again that 
Beth’s notes always looked as 
though she wrote them on horse- 
back. 

Upstairs he dropped her keys 



on the small mantle over the ] 
small real fireplace. Her bed- 1 
room door was slightly open. 
Just as he noticed this, Beth 
called out to him. 

“I hope that’s you, Ben?” she 
said from her room. 

“Where’ll I put the ice, lady?” 1 
he said. “You’re supposed to be 
out.” 

“Welcome back. I just got 
here and I had to change so I 
left the keys down there in case 
you got here while I was chang- 
ing. How was New York?” 
“Okay, but I’m glad I’m with 
the agency out here. How’d you 
get in without keys?” He sat 
down in the soft tan sofa- chair j 
he’d given her. 

“I have a key to the kitchen 
way. Is the show all right now?” j 
“I guess we fixed it for a while. 
How are you?” 

“Fine. And, hey, I have a good 
part in Alex’ new play. It just 
happened and I couldn’t write.” 
“You have lousy handwriting, 
you know,” Pendleton called. 
Grinning, he got out a cigarette 
and reached into his coat pocket 
for a book of matches. Some- 
thing jabbed into the palm of 
his hand. 

“It’s because I’m so intense,” 
Beth said, near her bedroom 
door. 

Pendleton winced and pulled 
a small toy Chinese junk out of 
the pocket. The price stamp was 



still on the bottom of the boat, 
25 cents. The old man must 
have dropped it in his pocket 
when he nudged him. 

Beth came up behind him. 
“It’s warm in here. Give me your 
coat. I have a whole new concept 
about making martinis. This 
fellow in Actors’ Lab told me. 
You do it with Zen.” Her hands 
rested on Pendleton’s shoulders. 

“I’ll be damned,” he said, rub- 
bing his palm with the boat as 
he stood. 

Beth slid her arms over his 
shoulders and locked her hands 
on his chest. “What’s that, Ben?” 

Pendleton turned around in 
her hold. He tapped her tanned 
nose with the toy boat and told 
her about it. “I suppose I should 
take it back,” he said finally. 

Beth laughed. “Makes you a 
receiver of stolen goods.” She 
took the toy boat and walked to 
the fireplace. She put it next to 
her keys and turned to him. She 
was wearing a light blue dress 
with a flared skirt. No stockings, 
flat black shoes. She’d cut her 
blonde hair short since he’d seen 
her last. ‘Welcome back,” she 
said, smiling. 

A light wind was starting up, 
tapping windows with tree 
branches, as Pendleton let him- 
self into Beth’s darkening apart- 
ment. He flipped the light switch 
on and started for the tan sofa 



chair, jiggling the keys in his 
hand. The bedroom door 
slammed. 

“You in there?” Pendleton 
called. Her note said she’d gone 
out for some forgotten groceries. 

Pendleton opened the bed- 
room door and turned on the 
lights. The window beyond 
Beth’s low, blue-covered bed was 
open and the wind was flapping 
the curtains against her dressing 
table. A strong flap caught a 
lipstick and flipped it into the 
thick rug. 

Edging around the bed, Pen- 
dleton closed the window and 
picked up the lipstick. He left 
the bedroom door a bit open and 
went back to the chair. There 
was a paper back by Eisenstein 
on the coffee table and he picked 
that up and read down the con- 
tents page. 

The wind got stronger and 
parts of the old building creaked, 
first something down under him, 
then something way up and to 
the right. Now and then there 
would be a bang from out in 
back. Pendleton dropped the 
book and got down on his knees 
in front of the fireplace and 
kindled a fire. As the fire took 
hold, bright sparks popped out 
into the room. 

Something started tapping on 
the window behind Pendleton’s 
chair. At last, in a lull between 
creaking and banging, he became 



112 



GALAXY 



SUBJECT TO CHANGE 



113 



aware of a tapping. He looked 
at the window and the early 
night sky. The tapping went on. 

There was a gray cat sitting 
on the sill outside. The cat was 
tangled up in an orange and blue 
bead necklace. “Lonely out 
there,” Pendleton said. He didn’t 
much like cats, but this one 
looked sad. He opened the win- 
dow and the cat jumped in, the 
necklace falling free and clat- 
tering against the wall. “We’ll see 
if maybe Beth’s got something 
around to give to wandering 
cats.” Pendleton reached out to 
pick up the cat. Sputtering, the 
animal raked at his fingers and 
dived between his legs. 

Pendleton spun and saw the 
cat scoot through the open bed- 
room door. “Hey, you little bas- 
tard, you’ll knock over things.” 

He was two steps from the 
door when it slammed and 
locked. Pendleton stopped, won- 
dering how the animal had man- 
aged to bang into the door hard 
enough to close it. He didn’t 
think the cat should stay in there 
and anyway Beth would want to 
get in when she got home. He’d 
pick the lock. Crouching, he 
reached for the knob. Something 
clicked and the door swung in. 
He recognized Beth’s terry robe 
and he looked up and saw her 
face, very pale. 

“Okay,” she said. “I guess I 
was too cute with the key bits. 



Go away, Ben, and leave me 
alone. Please?” 

‘What’s the matter?” He was 
still squatting and her stepping 
forward sent him over. 

“Just go away, Ben. Please, 
now.” She brushed by him and 
sat in a bucket chair, putting 
both bare feet down hard on the 
floor. 

Ben got himself up. “You 
drunk?” 

B ETH brushed at her hair. “I 
thought if you were sitting 
out here and I showed up in the 
bedroom, you’d think I came in 
the back way. Or that I was al- 
ready in there and just hadn’t 
heard you.” She bit her thumb. 
“Just another trick I wanted to 
try.” 

“What are you talking about?” 
He bent and scooped up the 
bead necklace. 

“Go away. That’s all.” 

“Well, why?” He twisted the 
string of beads around his 
knuckles. “Somebody else?” 
“Yes. Alex.” She smiled. 
“Alex? That fruiter who runs 
the Actors’ Lab.” The string 
broke and beads splattered away 
from him. Three landed in the 
fire. 

“Or maybe my Uncle Russ. 
Did you know we lived with 
with him for three years when I 
was a kid and I was always hav- 
ing odd fevers and things? He 



had some kind of quack x-ray 
business.” 

Pendleton took Beth’s shoul- 
ders. “You’re sick, is that it?” 
“No. Go away, Ben.” 

‘Well, what is it?” 

Beth sighed, annoyed. “You 
know about Method. You have 
to feel the parts, live them.” 
“Sure.” 

Beth shrugged her shoulders 
until Pendleton let go. “One 
weekend afternoon — oh, about 
two or three weeks after the 
agency sent you off — I was here 
trying to be an old lady. For an 
exercise at the Lab. And I was.” 
Pendleton blinked at her still 
pale fact. “That’s swell, Beth. 
A guy likes to know what his 
fiancee is up to while he’s away.” 
“I was an old lady.” She stood 
with her body thrust almost 
against him. “See? I changed.” 
He backed a little. “How 
about a drink?” 

“Don’t you get it, Ben? How 
the hell do you think I just came 
in?” 

“The back way.” Pendleton 
decided to try a drink on her 
and then find out who her doctor 
was these days. 

“I was the cat. Now you know 
about it and can go away, Ben.” 
She let herself fall to the floor 
and she huddled there, crying. 

“How long have you had this 
idea?” He knelt beside her, run- 
ning one hand over her back. 



“You know who put that silly 
damn boat in your pocket?” she 
asked. 

“Sure. You were that little old 
man.” 

Beth rolled and sat up, her 
legs tangled in the robe. She 
took a deep breath. “Listen, Ben. 
I got a kick out of changing into 
different kinds of people. It was 
a help in my work ab the Actors’ 
Lab. Then I got the idea it 
would be fun to try other things. 
Animals, chairs, tables. One 
rainy night I was a footstool un- 
til it was time to go to bed.” 

“I was a tea kettle as a boy. 
Stop kidding.” 

“I don’t know, Ben. It gets sort 
of vacant all around when you’re 
away somewhere. I had this feel- 
ing that I wanted to see if I 
could just step into a store or 
someplace and try to swipe 
something. Anything.” 

TJENDLETON found himself 
A starting to shake. He put 
his arms around Beth. “That was 
you, then, taking junk from an 
old Chinese.” 

“I could change, you see, and 
take things as all sorts of odd 
characters. If I was spotted and 
followed, I’d try to duck in an 
alley or a doorway and change 
again. The clothes are extra. 
Sometimes I could hide clothes 
in a lot. Most of the time, 
though, I’d have to change into 



114 



GALAXY 



SUBJECT TO CHANGE 



115 



something new. A bird, a cat. 
Then I’d carry what I had stolen 
in my beak or around my neck. 
She laughed softly. “Once I cop- 
ped an umbrella and changed 
into a big dog and went off with 
it in my mouth.” She twisted 
slightly in his arms. “I’m sorry. 
It’s all sort of odd and silly. I 
do it.” 

“Well, why?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“Beth?” He inched up, lifting 
her with him. 

“Yes?” She let him sit her in 
the sofa chair. 

“You have to go see some- 
body. You have to stop.” 

She stiffened. “If it was as 
simple as insanity, I would.” 

“Please, Beth.” He wandered 
to the fireplace and threw in 
more wood. 

“The stealing does bother me. 
I think the changing is good. I 
can use it to really go someplace 
in my acting career. Quit the 
secretary business altogether. I 
actually changed to an old wo- 
man for one of Alex’s one-acters. 
He thought I’d just done a good 
job of makeup. I don’t believe I 
want to simply stop, Ben.” 

“You have to!” 

“Don’t start shouting com- 
mands.” 

Pendleton sat across from her 
on the sofa. “Will you promise 
to start seeing somebody? May- 
be I can find out about a good 



man. Promise you’ll see him.” j 
“You going to ask around? 1 
Why don’t you do a TV spot? 
We are happy to announce that 
Beth Gershwin is daffy.’ ” 

“Relax, Beth. You decide 1 
what you want to do. I won’t j 
talk to anybody.” 

Beth moved to the window, j 
The wind had died. “I don’t ■ 
know, Ben.” 

“Let it rest. Let’s have the 
drink.” He came to her side. 

“I think I’d like to be alone 
for a while.” 

“I’d like to stay.” 

“I’d like you to go. Please.” 
“Beth.” 

“Go on, Ben.” She stared at 
him, then walked into her bed- ; 
room. 

She didn’t close the door and 
he followed. 

Her robe was spread-eagled 
on the bed. Pendleton looked 
around the room. Before, there 
had been one carved stool at 
the vanity table. Now there were 
two. 

Pendleton left the apartment 
and ran down the hall, taking 
short, shallow breaths. But he 
couldn’t just leave her. He bit 
his lip and went back through 
the still open door. 

“Come on, Beth. Don’t be 
stubborn,” he said into the bed- 
room, watching the two stools. 

He waited an hour. Then he 
turned off the lights and started 



116 



GALAXY 







to leave. Going out this time, he 
stepped on one of the wooden 
beads and almost fell onto the 
coffee table. 

Pendleton slammed Beth’s 
door and went out into the clear 
night. If she could be stubborn, 
so could he. 

TT WAS almost two weeks be- 
for she called him to apologize. 
She’d got him at the agency. He 
didn’t stay in his apartment 
much. He kept talking to himself 
if he did. 

You could see the street from 
the little Italian restaurant 
they’d agreed to meet in. Pendle- 
ton sat at a round table close to 
the wide window and watched 
for Beth. There was a slight haze 
in the afternoon air and most of 
the secretaries that passed were 
coatless. 

Beth started smiling a quarter 
of a block from him. She was in 
a light cotton dress, weaving in 
and out of the noontime pedes- 
trians. 

“Nice day,” Pendleton said, 
standing. 

Beth smiled and sat down. “I 
noticed that right off.” 

They ordered and Pendleton 
said, “How’ve you been?” 

“Great.” She clasped her 
hands together on the checkered 
table top. “You were right, Ben. 
I’m sorry I was mean.” 

Pendleton moved his glass of 



water three inches. “Good.” 

“I’ve started seeing a very 
highly recommended analyst. 
Things are starting to look up. 
I haven’t even had an impulse to 
filch anything in days.” 

The food arrived. “It’ll take 
time.” 

“I have a great part in Alex’s 
next play. It’s really a challenge. 
By Ionesco. Being able to change 
will help.” 

Pendleton set his fork down. 
“Huh?” 

“I tried changing into the 
character last night. It came off 
fine.” 

“What are you seeing a psy- 
chiatrist for, then?” he asked, his 
voice low. 

“So I won’t steal things any 
more.” 

He held the edge of the table 
for a minute, not meeting her 
eyes. Finally he said, “I see. Well, 
that’s fine, Beth. How’ve things 
been at work?” 

Beth grinned and told him. 

r I 'HE DAYS were turning cool 
-*• and the trees had started 
scattering dry leaves into the 
wind. On a sharp weekend after- 
noon Pendleton was killing time 
in the produce district before 
driving over to Beth’s. 

There was a coffee shop open 
and Pendleton thought about 
crossing over for a cup of coffee. 
The whitewashed door of the 



118 



GALAXY 



place shot open and a fat woman 
with an orange-fringed shawl 
came out. She was carrying 
something wrapped up in a 
paper napkin. She glanced at 
Pendleton, hesitated a second 
and then went running off to- 
ward a closed warehouse. By the 
time she reached it, the short- 
order cook was on the street 
looking after her. He threw a 
gesture after her and went back 
inside. 

Pendleton shivered once 
slightly. He started walking for 
his car and a block from it he 
found himself running. He got 
to Beth’s place ahead of the 
approaching dusk. 

The downstairs door wasn’t 
locked, but Beth’s apartment 
door didn’t open when he tried 
it. Pendleton grunted, slapping 
his pockets for something to pick 
the lock with. 

The door opened. Beth, in 
capris and a striped sweater, 
looked out at him, her head 
tilted slightly to one side. “Did 
I hear applause? You’re early.” 

“You know why I’m here 
early.” He pushed into the room. 
“I thought you were better. What 
the hell were you doing down 
there?” 

“Where? What’s the matter?” 
She backed across the rug to the 
fireplace. A small fire was going 
and she turned to warm her 
hands at it. 



“I just saw you steal some- 
thing from that diner. Silverware 
maybe. You want me to search 
the place?” 

Facing him, her lips hardly 
parted, Beth said, “I should 
think you would trust me, being 
we love each other and all. I was 
rehearsing until a half hour ago 
and Alex dropped me off. I’ve 
been here since then.” 

Pendleton’s hands fell to his 
sides. “Well, nothing I guess is 
wrong. I’m just jumpy. This 
changing thing bothers me.” 
Beth reached out and patted 
his arm. “It’s okay, Ben?” 

“Yeah.” He sat down in the 
tan chair and looked up at her. 

“Want to eat here tonight, by 
the fire? I’ll have the Flying 
Something deliver food.” 

“Good. And send out for a 
bottle or two.” 

Beth bent and kissed him. 
“Trust me again?” 

He brushed at her hair and 
nodded. 

J^ENDLETON dropped too 
much wood into the fireplace 
and a stick snapped out onto the 
rug. He gingerly picked up the 
stick and poked it back into the 
flames. He went back to the low 
sofa Beth was on. He found his 
glass in the dark and refilled it 
from the pitcher. 

Beth reached out with one 
bare foot and stroked the side of 



SUBJECT TO CHANGE 



119 



his head. She had put on a dark 
blue dress with several stiff lace 
petticoats and whenever he tried 
to touch her she made crackling 
sounds. 

“You’re really a nice fellow,” 
Beth said, finding his ear with 
her toe. 

“So are you,” he said, finishing 
his drink. 

“Maybe we should go ahead 
and get married.” 

Ben agreed and poured fresh 
drinks. 

“Ben?” 

“Yeah?” 

“I’m sorry.” She was crying. 

“What is it?” 

“It was me this afternoon. I 
have been doing those things. I 
never went to any highly recom- 
mended man at all.” 

Pendleton felt tolerant. “So 
what? Things will work out some- 
how.” 

B ETH sat up. “I can’t stop it, 
Ben.” 

Pendleton thought he heard 
an odd quaver in her voice. 
“You’re not onstage now, kid. 
Save the phony touches.” 

Her leg swung round, just 
missing his head, and she stood 
up. “That’s your trouble. You’re 
totally incapable of compre- 
hending.” 

“I comprehend you. You’re 
loony and a liar.” 

Beth slapped him. “It’ll be 



simpler if I stop being me!” 

Pendleton had somehow got- 
ten his arm stuck under the sofa. 
“Take it easy.” 

He was aware of a rustling 
sound and when he got loose and 
came up he saw Beth naked by 
the window for an instant. As he 
looked she changed. Then there 
were two tan sofa chairs in the 
room. 

Pendleton called Beth’s name 
over and over, but she wouldn’t 
come back. It got cold in the 
apartment after a time and he 
threw all the wood he could 
find in the fire. He crawled over 
to the martini pitcher and drank 
from it. He noticed that some 
sticks had fallen out and landed 
in the tangle of petticoats Beth 
had left and he smiled at the 
disorder of everything and put 
his head back against the sofa. 

Petticoats crackling woke him. 
Even before he got his head up 
very high in the room, he was 
coughing. The room was turning 
bright, sparkling orange. 

“Beth!” he said. “Beth!” 

There were still the two tan 
sofa chairs. 

“Beth, sober up now! Come 
on, change! We’ve got to get 
out!” 

Nothing happened. Pendleton 
looked at the chairs a moment. 
The one on the left. He grabbed 
it up and wavered to the apart- 
ment door. To make sure, hed 



have to come up for the other 
one. 

For several minutes it seemed 
the chair would stay wedged in 
the doorway. It came free finally 
and he went back with it and 
tumbled and twisted down the 
stairs. 

A SIREN met him in the cold 
night outside. The engines 
were already there. The firemen 
were heading for the building. 

Spray fell back across the 
street where Pendleton took the 
chair. “Beth, please,” he said in 
a low voice. “Change now.” He 
tried to go get the other chair, 



to be sure, but they wouldn’t let 
him. 

He fell into the one he’d 
picked and began crying softly. 
The sirens stopped. Before he let 
the ambulance people look at 
him, he insisted that the chair 
be looked after. 

No trace of Beth was found 
and Pendleton couldn’t explain 
what had happened. After they 
let him go, he had the chair sent 
to his apartment. 

He put it very carefully in 
the living room by the liquor

THE MENACE FROM EARTH 
by Robert A. Heinlein. Gnome 
Press, Hicksville, N. Y., $3.50 
THE TROUBLE with Heinlein 
is that once he explores a situa- 
tion, not much is left to be said. 
His prototypes are up-to-the- 
minute masterworks. 

Take, for example, the fa- 
mous time travel paradox, “By 
His Bootstraps.” In 18 years I 
haven’t seen its equal. Likewise 
for the frightening classic from 
Galaxy, “Year of the Jackpot.” 
Ditto again for the 1942 “Gold- 
fish Bowl.” 



Of the more recent items, a 
startler is the tongue-in-cheek 
Ladies-Home- Journal-type ap- 

proach of “The Menace from 
Earth,” set in a wildly imagina- 
tive alien environment. 

The minor stories pull down 
the batting average, but only a 
little.

novels, is sufficiently renowned 
to be used in N.Y. Times cross- 
word puzzles. In 1958-59, while 
visiting lecturer at Princeton, he 
delivered a series of talks for 
Seminars in Criticism from 
which most of this book is taken. 

Whereas most serious studies 
of science fiction notoriously are 
written by critics with neither 
background nor liking for the 
field, Amis is a longtime reader, 
though not writer, of it. 

A well-known author with a 
very considerable knowledge of 
the field — shouldn’t one expect 
his influence to be beneficial? 

Regrettably, it isn’t. Amis has 
read science fiction long enough 
to specialize, to narrow his inter- 
ests remorselessly. 

“Nasty” is his thematic word 
— it appears just about every- 
where throughout the book — 
and his title buttons up the tank 
he would like to make of science 
fiction to bust through main- 
stream literature (which he says 
bites off less than it can chew) 
and civilization (which he wants 
this field to criticize, and, he 
stresses, sharply), among other 
prime but purely personal tar- 
gets. 

In short, Amis demands socio- 
logical science fiction and, it 
seems clear, nothing else. As a 
reader, he could easily restrict 
his choices to that. As an influ- 
ence on the field, however, his 



restrictions would be deadly 
constrictions. 

THE LITTLE MEN by Joseph 
E. Kelleam. Avalon Books, N.Y., 
$2.95 

THE LITTLE Men and the 
Brons, normal-sized descendants 
of a 25,000-year-old emergency 
landing on Earth, inhabit a gi- 
gantic cavern extending under 
half the U. S. According to 
Kelleam, we’re the peace-disturb- 
ing upstairs neighbors, our noisy 
atom bomb parties draining 
energy from their pint-sized sun. 

A hothead member of a secret 
mission of undergrounders kills 
our Chief of Staff and Dr. Jack 
Odin, prophetic name, becomes 
a modern Dr. Mudd by treating 
the assassin’s wounds. Brought 
back to the underworld paradise 
by Princess Maya, a dish, he 
embraces their cause (and her). 

A slight, frothy adventure 
pegged solely for entertainment, 
it comes reasonably close to its 
mark.

THE ARMCHAIR SCIENCE 
READER edited by Isabel S. 
Gordon and Sophie Sorkin. 
Simon and Schuster, N.Y., $7.95 
THIS GIANT has everything 
except pictures: stories, facts, 

fantasy, poetry, plays, biography. 
The common denominator is sci- 
ence and everything of interest 



goes, from excerpts of Newton’s 
correspondence with the Royal 
Society to Percy Shelley; from 
Benet’s “By the Waters of Baby- 
lon” to Sidney Howard’s “Yellow

Richard E. Byrd alone in the 
Antarctic. 

This is that rare book into

THE BEST FROM FANTASY 
AND SCIENCE FICTION, 
NINTH SERIES, edited by 
Robert P. Mills. Doubleday and

THIS FIRST anthology under

set by its predecessors. There 
are such superior items as Daniel 
Keyes’ “Flowers for Algernon,” 
Heinlein’s “All You Zombies,” 
Damon Knight’s “What Rough 
Beast” and Bester’s “The Pi 
Man.” However, there are also 
the Ferdinand Feghoot things 
and “Invasion of the Planet of

humor delicately applied with a 
shovel. 

Despite these, the overall 
quality is high.

IS THERE INTELLIGENT 
LIFE ON EARTH? by Alan 
Dunn. Simon & Schuster, N.Y., 
$3.50 

DUNN’S PARAPHRASE of a 




frequent speculation on other 
planets is more than funny. 

Though this is ostensibly an 
account of a fact-finding expedi- 
tion from Mars to Earth to 
answer the above question, Dunn 
actually needs no alien view- 
point to point up the screwiness 
of human behavior. 

His cartoon and text format 
is a delight just to look and 
laugh at — but don’t take it 
personally. 

MATHEMATICS IN EVERY- 
DAY THINGS by William C. 
Vergara. Harper & Bros., N.Y., 
$3.95 

VERGARA ADOPTS the same 
apparently haphazard question 
and answer format that he used 
in his highly successful Science 
in Everyday Things. The prime 
difference is that his present 
book presupposes an acquaint- 
ance by the reader with high 
school math. 

Some conversation-piece ex- 
cerpts: Possible baseball line- 
ups, excluding pitchers, 259,459,- 
200; with only 24 friends, the 
possibility of any two having 
identical birthdays is better than 
even; the chances are 500 to 1 
against drawing a flush. Fun 
aside, though, there’s plenty of 
useful information in text and 
added tables.

His agents comb the rubble of

THE SEQUEL to Blastoff at

enlivens its pages, except for the 
cold-fish director of the interna-

domes on the moon. These alien 
structures, bombarding Earth 
with neutrons, cause atomic piles 
to reach critical activity as well 
as increase the incidence of ane-

Young Chris Godfrey is called 
on in the crisis as the only 
human qualified to ride the 
rocket that will eject a beacon 
pinpointing the domes and hom-

Walters writes a taut, tense

ROUND 

AND- 

ROUND 

TRIP 

By H. B. FYFE 



All he wanted to do was go 



W HEN the passengers 
from Epseri II had been 
chauffered from the 
Centaur Queen to the administra- 
tion building of the spaceport, the 
man whose papers identified him 
as Robert L. Winstead trailed 
the others to the Insterstellar 
Travel Agency counter. His tak- 
ing an unobtrusive place near the 



end of the line was entirely in 
keeping with his unobtrusive 
appearance. 

Of medium height but some- 
what underweight, Winstead 
looked like a tired clerk who had 
not slept well in space. The wide 
trousers of his conservative ma- 
roon suit flapped about his thin 
shins and drew attention to the 



fact that he had donned one blue 
and one green sock. 

The processing was rapid; 
most of the two dozen passengers 
meant to stay here on St. Andrew 
V. Only a few, of whom Win- 
stead was one, carried “ultimate 
destination” tickets. They re- 
mained after the locals had been 
taken in charge by a guide who

would see them into the adjacent 
city. 

Winstead finally reached a 
clerk, a dark, extremely brisk 
young man. He presented his 
papers. The young man riffled 
through them, stamped the date 
of arrival on the travel record 
according to both local and 
Terr an calendar, then turned 
back abruptly to the card show- 
ing Winstead’s destination. He 
shook his head in puzzled an- 
noyance. 

“I’m very sorry, Mr. — uh — 
Winstead. Is this the proper ticket 
you’ve given me? Could you have 
gotten it mixed up with some- 
one else’s?” 

The traveler coughed and 
spluttered worried, questioning 
noises. A look of vague alarm 
spread over his undistinguished 
features. 

His wispy gray hair had be- 
come rumpled when he had 
pulled off and stuffed into a side 
pocket his rather sporty maroon- 
and-white checked cap. This, plus 
the fact that he had to look up to 
the clerk, lent him an air of the 
typical little man in the wrong 
queue. It did not help that he 
wore old-fashioned sunglasses in- 
stead of colored contacts, and 
had forgotten to remove them 
before peering at the ticket. 

“Why — er — yes, yes, this 
is right,” he said. “See, here’s my 
name on it.” 



r |''HE clerk sighed as he looked 
around, but his partner was 
busy. “Someone seems to have 
blown a nova, sir,” he conde- 
scended to explain. “It says here 
your ultimate destination is 
Altair IV.” 

“Quite right, quite right,” said 
Winstead. “Going out there to see 
what the sales possibilities are 
for — ” 

“And they sent you here from 
Epssri? That can’t be, sir.” 

“But — they told me — don’t 
you Agency people take care of 
picking out the routes?” 

“Yes, sir, of course. Beyond the 
local Terran sphere of travel, 
there are very few scheduled 
flights and most of them are for 
important cargo. That’s why your 
ticket simply shows your ulti- 
mate destination, and that’s why 
the Interstellar Travel Agency 
was developed — to arrange for 
the traveler’s progress by stages." 

“Yes,” said Winstead. “That is 
how they explained it to me.” 
The clerk met his worried gaze 
for a few moments before shaking 
himself slightly. He prodded the 
ticket on the counter between 
him and Winstead with a dis- 
dainful forefinger. 

“Let me put it as simply as 
possible, Mr. — uh — Winstead,” 
he said very patiently. “Some- 
body at your last stop sent you 
in the wrong direction.” 

“But — but — you just said 

GALAXY 



it went by stages. I realize I can’t 
go in a direct line. It depends on 
whether you can find me the right 
ship, doesn’t it?” 

The young man glanced about 
once more for help, but none was 
available. 

“We’ll see what we can do,” 
he said, examining the ticket 
sourly. He thumbed a button to 
roll out a length of note paper 
from a slot in the counter top 
and scribbled upon it with his 
lectropen. “Now, if you will 
please accompany that young 
lady to the Agency hotel with 
those other travelers, we will 
notify you the moment a desir- 
able ship is scheduled to leave.” 

Winstead thanked him grate- 
fully and turned away to locate 
his baggage. Under the conditions 
imposed by space travel, only the 
barest minimum was permitted. 
Even so, some little time was re- 
quired to find his bag — an un- 
likely occurrence that the clerk 
accepted with a resigned air. 

Finally, with the half dozen 
who also would be traveling on- 
ward, Winstead was off to the 
hotel and a day’s res,t. 

As a matter of fact, it was 
three days’ rest, before he was 
summoned. He was, perhaps by 
intent, confronted upon his ar- 
rival by a different clerk, a solid, 
square-faced girl. Winstead’s nerv- 
ous questions were reflected un- 
answered from a shield of 

ROUND-AND-ROUND 






impervious calm. He received 
all the information the Agency 
seemed to feel was good for him 
and was sent out with a personal 
guide. 

The guide delivered him to a 
thick thing named the Stellar 
Streak, clearly a workhorse 
freighter. Somehow, it never did 
become plain to Winstead until 
after he had emerged from his 
acceleration net that the destina- 
tion was Topaz IV. 

“But, Captain!” he protested. 
“Are you sure the people at the 
spaceport have not made some 
mistake? That is more or less 
the direction I came from.” 

The pilot stared impatiently at 
the papers thrust under his nose. 

“Can’t say, sir. We have our 
work cut out just to take the ship 
to where they tell us. Only reason 
we carry passengers is that regu- 
lations require cooperation with 
the Agency. Don’t believe in it 
myself.” 

IVjR. WINSTEAD sighed and 
returned to his quarters. At 
least, on this ship, he still had a 
private compartment in which to 
float his net. There was even a 
chair, equipped with a safety belt 
and folding table, bolted to the 
deck. What he did miss was the 
general dining saloon of the liner 
he had taken from Epseri II. 

Still, he reflected, travel can’t 
always be luxurious. 

TRIP

He spent some time, after the 
ship had slipped into stellar drive, 
in unpacking his one small suit- 
case. He found that he had to 
take his shaver to the general 
head to plug it in, but otherwise 
got along comfortably enough. 
One or two of the crew who 
shared his turn at the galley 
counter, in fact, took him for an 
old space hopper and began to 
exchange yarns. 

This sort of semi-suspended 
living passed the four-day hop to 
the Topaz system and the extra 
day necessary for planetary ap- 
proach. When they landed, Win- 
stead was the only passenger, 
either incoming or outgoing, to 
show up at the cargo shed des- 
ignated as the spaceport admin- 
istration building. 

Here on Topaz IV, the Agency 
clerk was a part-time man who 
had to be called from the mines 
on the far side of the city. He 
arrived to find Winstead dozing 
on a cot at the end of the shed. 

“Billy Callahan,” he introduced 
himself. “They say you’re not for 
the mines.” 

“That is correct,” answered 
Winstead, stretching a kink out 
of his back. “I have my destina- 
tion here in these papers ... if 
you will bear with me a mo- 
ment. .” 

He fumbled out his identifica- 
tion, travel record, and ticket. 
Callahan, rubbing his carroty hair 



with a large, freckled hand, pored 



over them. A few minutes of 1 
searching through the battered 1 
desk that was his headquarters I 
revealed the official arrival stamp. 
Its inky smear was duly added 
to the record. 

“Now for your way outa here,” . 
grunted Callahan. “Meanwhile, 
how about a cigar, Mr. Win- 1 
stead?” 

“Why — thanks very much.” j 

Winstead regarded the torpedo 
doubtfully. He wondered upon 
which planet the tobacco for it 
— if it was tobacco — had been 
grown. 

“This might take a little while,” 3 
said Callahan, applying to the 
ends of their cigars a lighter that ] 
could have welded I-beams. “It j 
ain’t every day we get a through 1 
traveler here. I gotta look up the j 
Galatlas an’ the shipping notices.” j 

He hoisted a bulky catalogue 
from a side table onto his desk ' 
and blew off a cloud of dust. J 
Winstead seized the excuse to 
cough out a lungful of smoke. 
His host reached out for the 
ticket. 

“Ultimate destination Fomal- 
haut VIII,” he read off. “Say! 
That ain’t one I ever had to 
handle before!” 

He leafed through the volume 
for some minutes, reexamined the 
ticket, then dug into two or three 
appendices. He tapped a knobby 
knuckle against his chin. 

GALAXY 



It don’t look to me, Mr. Win- 
stead,” he said thoughtfully, “like 
you shoulda wound up here at 
all. Fomalhaut VIII! That’s a hell 
of a way from here!” 

“The clerk at the last space- 
port did seem to think there had 
been a mistake,” Winstead vol- 
unteered cautiously. 

“Somethin’ sure slipped. May- 
be some jet-head read his 
directions wrong an’ sent you so 
many degrees Sol north instead 
of Sol south. Best you can say is 
you’re still on the right general 
side of the Solar System.” 

“Oh, dear!” Winstead said, 
flustered. “What can you do 
about that?” 

“Depends what ships, if any, 
are due here. If I was you, I’d 
take the first one out. Get to a 
bigger settlement, where you’ll 
get a better choice of ships.” 

IXE FLICKED ash from his 
cigar and inquired whether 
Winstead had retained quarters 
aboard the Stellar Streak. He 
was undaunted by the negative 
reply. 

“Never mind,” he said heartily. 
“We’re too small to have an 
Agency hotel here, but I’ll fix 
you up a place to stay in town.” 
They left Winstead’s bag un- 
der the desk and set off by 
dilapidated groundcar for Topaz 
City. This turned out to be a 
crude, sprawling village of adobe 



walls and corrugated plastic roofs. 
The varied colors of the roofs 
contrasted in desperate gaiety 
with the dun walls. As soon as 
Callahan skidded to a halt, the 
car was enveloped by its own 
dust cloud. 

“Phew!” coughed Callahan. 
“Some day they’re gonna have to 
pave the street!” 

Winstead pulled out a hand- 
kerchief to mop his tear-flooded 
eyes. His thin chest heaved and 
he spat out muddy saliva. 

“I’m sorry about that,” apolo- 
gized Callahan. “Tell you what 
— we don’t have much civiliza- 
tion yet, but we do have a little 
cocktail lounge. Come along an’ 
I’ll get you somethin’ to clear 
your throat.” 

The traveler allowed himself 
to be helped out of the car and 
guided along the “street” to a low 
building marked by a small 
parking jam. Most of the men 
and women that passed them on 
the way shouted out a greeting 
to his companion. They dressed 
with little distinction between the 
sexes in rough shirts, boots, and 
pants of a narrower pattern than 
Winstead’s conservative suit. He 
was introduced to six or seven 
people he never expected to lay 
eyes upon again. 

Frontier culture, he deduced. 
Where humans are rare, each one 
counts for more. 

The first thing he saw in the 



132 



ROUND-AND-ROUND TRIP 



133 



lounge was the girl guitarist. She 
was the only woman he had yet 
seen who was not wearing pants. 
In fact, it had hardly occurred to 
him that there might be someone 
in town who was not connected 
with the mines. This girl was 
hardly connected to her own brief 
costume. 

The second thing he saw was 
a wall of friendly, weather-beaten 
faces, turning his way in response 
to Callahan’s cheerful whoop. The 
third was a man-size drink some- 
body thrust at him. 

After listening for quite a while 
to a repertoire of apparently 
ribald songs, most of them too 
local in humor for Winstead to 
follow, the traveler was led by 
Callahan to a sort of restaurant 
just down the street. 

Winstead thought later that he 
had eaten something there, but 
what it might have been he for- 
got as soon as they returned to 
the cocktail lounge, for a bottle- 
swinging brawl broke out almost 
immediately in a far corner. After 
a form of order had been re- 
stored, there was a girl who 
danced; and presently Callahan 
was shaking him up and down on 
a spine-stiffening bed in a small, 
darkened room. 

Winstead promptly discovered 
that he had, indeed, eaten. When 
he recovered, he followed Cal- 
lahan out on wobbly legs to seek 
a remedy. It was a bright, sunny 



day, but he could not even guess 
at the local time. A little while 
after they had been successful in 
finding the remedy, he forgot 
about it. 

“Take care of Bobby Winstead 
for me a little while, George,” he 
heard Callahan say to someone, j 
“I gotta stop out at the port to 
check a ship for him. Be right 
back.” 

T HE hospitality shown him 
shamed Winstead into inquir- 
ing where he might cash a 
traveler’s check. With the pro- 
ceeds, he was permitted to buy 
about one round in a dozen, and 
to join in the singing. He was 
eagerly pumped between stops 
along the street for the latest 
news of Terra. His least little 
knowledge was of interest to 
those he encountered. 

At one point, he came to 
himself in the midst of drawing 
a current dress design on the bar 
for one of the girls. Callahan, 
whose return he had missed, dis- 
suaded the lady from taking his 
charge home with her as a gesture 
of pure gratitude. He declared 
that Winstead had just enough 
time for a nap. 

Winstead’s next awakening 
was in the echo of a terrified 
scream. 

A light was turned on and he 
discovered that the man-eating 
vine which had been strangling 



134 



GALAXY 



him was in reality an acceleration 
net. The face that floated before 
him was clean-shaven and anx- 
ious. 

With considerable mental ef- 
fort, Winstead deduced that the 
face was inquiring as to his health. 

“Quite . fine . thank . 
you,” he answered with difficulty. 
“Haven’t we met somewhere?” 

“Sure! Last week, Mr. Win- 
stead, when we took you to 
Topaz IV,” said the face. 

Winstead tried shaking his 
head. It did not hurt — very 
much — but he felt that his 
thinking was terribly slow. Then 
things began to click. He recog- 
nized the man as the second pilot 
of the Stellar Queen. It might 
have been easier had the spacer 
not been standing upside down to 
Winstead’s twisted position. 

He groped dizzily for a ques- 
tion that would not make him 
sound a complete idiot. The pilot 
saved him. 

“Callahan, back on Topaz IV,” 
he volunteered, “asked us to tell 
you the best routing he could 
figure was to go on with us to 
Queen Bess III. It’s a busy space- 
port, so he thinks you can make 
better connections.” 

“Oh. I . see,” murmured 
Winstead. 

Unzipping the opening of his 
net, he floated himself out gin- 
gerly. 

“I hope it’s all right, Mr. Win- 



stead,” said the spacer. “I know 
you went in there on an Altair 
IV destination, but old Callahan 
seemed to think he was sending 
you to Fomalhaut VIII. To tell 
the truth, I think he was a little 
over-fueled.” 

“I . didn’t notice,” said Win- 
stead. “Tell me — how long were 
you down at Topaz?” 

“Three days,” the spacer told 
him. “They sure took a liking to 
you there, Mr. Winstead. A big 
crowd brought you out to the 
spaceport with Callahan. We 
found your bag under his desk by 
ourselves, but I don’t know where 
you got that orange suit.” 

Winstead looked down at his 
clothing for the first time and 
flinched. 

“But that was yesterday,” con- 
tinued the pilot. “You ought to be 
feeling like some chow by now, 
eh? Hey wait — the door is 
down here, Mr. Winstead!” 

In six days, including one of 
landing maneuvers, they reached 
Queen Bess III, a very Terran 
world that was a minor crossroads 
of space travel. 

Here, Winstead bade farewell 
to the Stellar Queen. His first 
stop was the communications 
office. He left a message to be 
transmitted to Callahan on Topaz 
IV by “fastest means” — i. e., by 
the next spaceship headed that 
way. He said, simply, “Thanks 
for everything.” 



ROUND-AND-ROUND TRIP

TTE FOUND a good many 
travelers wandering about 
the clean, beautifully furnished 
waiting room of the Agency here. 
Winstead sank into a softly up- 
holstered armchair, opened his 
bag, and began to sort out his 
papers. No sooner did he look up 
from this task than there ap- 
peared before him a pleasantly 
smiling, gray-haired man. He was 
about Winstead’s height, but 
chunky and full of bounce. 

“My name is John Aubrey,” he 
announced. “I trust I can be of 
service. Are you stopping here 
on Bessie?” 

“No, I — I’m just passing 
through,” said Winstead. “I as- 
sume you are the Agency official 
here?” 

“One of them,” Aubrey said. 
“Ah, your papers? Thank you. 
We can just step this way into 
my office if you like.” 

He threaded his way between 
chairs, tables, and occasional 
travelers to one of a row of 
offices. It was the size of a large 
closet, but cheerfully decorated. 
Aubrey gave Winstead a chair 
and sat himself down behind an 
extremely modern desk to com- 
mit the required formalities upon 
the traveler’s papers. The ulti- 
mate destination ticket Winstead 
had included gave him pause. 

“Well, well, well!” he exclaimed. 
“Achernar X! Really! You must 
be with the government, I sup- 



pose? Or a scientist? As I recall, 
Achernar is rather blue for 
human use, except our research 
outpost there, isn’t it?” 

“I — er — I am engaged in a 
little research,” said Winstead. 
“You did very well to remember 
the place offhand.” 

“It is a long way out. Interest- 
ing. I wonder how I can get you 
there. Someone seems to have 
sent you — well, no matter. Just 
leave it to me. You’ll be staying 
at our hotel, of course? Might as 
well, since you have paid for the 
service, eh? I’ll have you flown 
over right away.” 

An aircar carried Winstead to 
the roof of a hotel overlooking a 
considerable metropolis. Having 
left his bag in his room, he found 
his way to the hotel department 
store and ordered another suit 
He spent the rest of the afternoon 
sightseeing and decided that he 
might just as well have been on 
Terra. When he sat down to an 
excellent dinner that evening, he 
discovered that his appetite, un- 
fortunately, had not recovered 
from his stay on Topaz IV. 

He was awakened before dawn 
by the soft chime of his bedside 
screen. A touch of the button 
brought on the happy features of 
Aubrey. 

Does he never rest? thought 
Winstead. 

He pushed the audio button 
and answered.

GALAXY 



“Good morning, Mr. Winstead,” 
said the Agency man brightly. 
“Sorry to call so early, but I was 
extremely lucky to find you a 
passage toward Achernar.” 

“Not sure I want to go,” Win- 
stead muttered into his pillow. 

Aubrey, apparently not hearing 
him, bubbled merrily on. There 
would be an aircar on the hotel 
roof for Winstead in half an hour. 
Haste was necessary because the 
ship was leaving from a spaceport 
fifty miles outside the city. In- 
deed, Winstead could count him- 
self fortunate to have had the 
chance so quickly. Aubrey had 
found it only by checking all the 
private spacelines. After all, 
Achernar was a long way off. 

Winstead thanked him blearily 
before switching off. He then 
dialed the hotel store, but got no 
more answer than he expected. 
Giving up thoughts of his new 
suit, he rose and struggled into 
his clothes. 

Q UEEN BESS had not yet 
poked her corona above the 
horizon when the aircar delivered 
him to a little island spaceport 
south of the city. A stocky, taci- 
turn shadow met him. They 
walked silently out to a ship that 
towered darkly overhead. 

“No inside elevator?” asked 
Winstead, peering at the skeleton 
framework rising beside the ship. 
‘Too much load.” 



They rode a creaking platform 
up through the chilly breeze until 
Winstead thought they would go 
past the nose of the monster. 
Clutching his bag in one hand 
and the single railing in the other, 
he edged across a narrow gang- 
way to an airlock. Inside, he fol- 
lowed the crewman down a short, 
three-foot-diameter shaft to a 
square chamber, catching his bag 
on the ladder no more than a 
few times. 

In the more adequate light 
here, the spacer was revealed as 
a swarthy man with a muscular, 
dark-stubbled face. He wore tight 
trousers and shirt of navy blue 
and a knit cap that might once 
have been white. With a preoc- 
cupied air, he pulled open a small 
door on the bulkhead at chest 
level. 

“Let’s have your bag,” he said. 

Winstead handed it over. The 
spacer shoved it into what 
seemed to be a spacious com- 
partment in spite of the yard- 
square door. 

“Now you,” he said. “I’ll give 
you a hand up.” 

“Up where?” asked Winstead 
innocently. 

“In there. That’s your acceler- 
ation compartment. Plenty of 
room. Armored, air-conditioned, 
has its own emergency rations of 
air and water.” 

Winstead stooped to peer into 
the opening. It was deeper than 



R O U N D - A N D - R O U N D TRIP 



137 




he had thought, but a three-foot 
square was not much of a cross 
section. All surfaces inside were 
thickly padded and springy to 
the touch. 

“Here’s the light switch,” the 
spacer said, turning on a soft in- 
terior light. “The rest of the 
facilities and instructions are on 
this plate beside the hatch. Okay 
now, grab that handhold up there 
so you go in feet first. Alley-oop!” 
As long as 1 don’t come out 
that way, thought Winstead, slid- 
ing into the compartment with 
surprising ease. He twisted 
around and discovered that the 
door had a small window. 

“Make yourself comfortable,” 
said the spacer. “Just don’t for- 
get to close the hatch when the 
takeoff buzzer sounds. You’d bet- 
ter listen for it” 

He turned away. Winstead saw 
him look into several other little 
windows along the bulkhead. 

“Are there other passengers?” 
asked Winstead. 

“No. Just checking to see if 
all my crew stayed. Always seems 
to be one that slides down the 
pipe before takeoff. Dunno why 
they sign on if they don’t like 
the risk.” 

“What — what risk?” 

“Didn’t the Agency tell you? 
We’ve got nothing below here but 
tanks of concentrated landing 
fuel for the station on Gelbchen 
II. The idea makes some of them 



nervous now and then. They talk 
quiet, they walk quiet, and they 
wouldn’t wear an orange suit.” 
He pulled open a door and 
nodded in gloomy satisfaction 
when the compartment proved to 
be empty. 

“Is it dangerous?” asked Win- 
stead. 

r T , HE spacer gnawed upon a 
very short thumbnail. “What’s 
dangerous?” he retorted at last. 
“You can get killed any day 
under a downcoming aircar.” 
Winstead considered. “Where’s 
the captain?” he inquired. 

“I’m the captain.” 

“But — aren’t you preparing 
to blast off?” 

“I generally let my second 
pilot do it,” said the spacer. 

“But why? I thought — ” 
“Why? Because I own the ship, 
that’s why.” 

“What has that got to do with 
it?” said Winstead. “I should 
think you’d want all the more 
to handle it yourself!” 

“Listen — I sweated out years 
in space, saving the price of this 
can. If she blows up, d’you think 
I want to know that I did it? 
There’s the buzzer. Button up!” 
He pulled himself into a com- 
partment like Winstead’s and 
clapped the door shut. Winstead, 
beginning to perspire gently, 
found the safety straps, secured 
himself, and awaited the worst. 



ROUND-AND-ROUND TRIP 



139 




The Leaky Dipper sped 
through interstellar space for five 
silent and introverted days before 
reaching the little yellow sun 
named Gelbchen. The highlight 
of the flight was the day one of 
the crew dropped his mess tray 
on the deck, causing one faint, 
one case of palpitations, and one 
fist fight, in approximately that 
order. 

The captain spent two days 
groping his way into an orbit 
about the second planet. When 
he announced that the cargo 
would be pumped into a number 
of small local tankers that had 
risen from the surface to meet 
them, Winstead volunteered to 
go down in the first one. 

“Don’t blame you,” said the 
swarthy spacer. “I’d like to go 
too. Don’t worry — they’ll be 
good and careful landing. The 
stuff’s that much more expensive 
now that it’s been freighted out 
here.” 

“That is a — a great relief,” 
said Winstead. “It’s been very in- 
teresting. Good-by and good 
luck!” 

“Likewise,” said the captain. 

If I ever meet Aubrey again! 
thought Winstead. 

On the surface of the planet, 
he met with a thriving commun- 
ity that lived in a peculiar milieu 
blended of well-being and isola- 
tion. The spaceport was a center 
for refueling and repair. It was 



supported by mines and mills, 
and by just enough agricultural 
organization to get by. The stan- 
dard of living was comfortably 
high because of the services ren- 
dered and charged for; but some 
of the customs struck Winstead 
as being almost too informal. 

“I think you’re pulling my leg!” 
exclaimed the slim blonde at the 
Agency counter when Winstead 
was escorted in from the field. 
“Nobody would travel on the 
Leaky Dipper without being paid 
for it. You must have real nerve!” 
She leaned uninhibitedly 
across the counter and planted 
a kiss on his cheek. He could not 
help noticing that she was not 
slim everywhere. 

“I assure you, Miss — er — 
here are my papers.” 

“Oh, those! Let me see, I have 
a stamp somewhere in one of 
my drawers.” 

gHE rummaged through sev- 
^ eral hiding places under the 
counter. Winstead thought of the 
compartments on the Leaky Dip- 
per. He leaned wearily on one 
elbow. 

“Oh, well, it’s time to close 
up anyway,” the girl decided. She 
swept his papers into a drawer, 
after a fast glance at them. “We 
can fix these up tomorrow, Bob.” 
“You are a very quick reader,” 
Winstead said. 

“It said ‘Robert L.,’ didn’t it? 



That’s all I was looking for — 
your name. Mine’s Carole, just 
to keep things straight. Now, 
since no more ships are due and 
no passengers can leave tonight, 
let’s get out of here.” 

Winstead looked around, but 
the mechanic who had brought 
him in from the field had long 
since disappeared. Other clerks 
went about their own affairs in 
the background without showing 
any interest in him. 

Carole hoisted herself onto the 
counter and twisted across in a 
swirl of skirts. There was no way 
for Winstead to avoid catching 
her. He saw that she was not 
really slim anywhere. 

Grabbing his hand, she set off 
at a smart pace. He had just time 
to hook his bag off the counter 
as they passed it. 

“You’ll be wanting a place to 
stay,” she said. “I’ll bet you never 
slept well on that spaceship.” 

This so neatly paralleled Win- 
stead’s own opinion that he re- 
jected a half-formed impulse to 
drag his feet. 

They dashed pell-mell through 
a wide exit from the building to 
a parking lot. Carole led the way 
to a monstrous groundcar that 
looked as if its mother had been 
frightened by a truck. A moment 
later, they were boosting up to 
stellar speed along a more-or-less 
paved road to the city. 

“They call it ‘Junction,’ ” 



140 



GALAXY 



ROUND-AND-ROUND 



Carole informed him. “You’d 
think they could have picked a 
better name for the only real 
city on the planet.” 

They buzzed through a narrow 
band of suburbs, along the edge 
of an open square and deceler- 
ated at a well-lighted avenue 
that looked like an entertainment 
section. Winstead noted that 
most of the men and women 
strolling past the taverns and 
theaters were dressed in work 
clothes. 

“Just finishing their shifts, like 
me,” Carole explained. 

She slowed the monster a bit 
more upon entering a side street. 
They came to a section of four- 
and five-storied buildings whose 
metal curtain walls had the air of 
business offices. It developed im- 
mediately that they were apart- 
ment houses. 

Carole pulled into an opening 
in a row of parked vehicles sim- 
ilar to hers. Winstead got out 
quickly, since his hostess seemed 
about to crawl across his lap to 
reach the door. He stared at the 
groundcar meditatively. 

“Awful heap, isn’t it?” said the 
blonde. “They have to make 
them that way here, so they can 
be converted for trucking. The 
spaceships count on Gelbchen II; 
everything else — including us 
— is what can be scraped up to 
do the job. Well, come on in!” 

I really must be very tired, 

TRIP 141 



Winstead -thought as he meekly 
followed the girl into the lobby 
of the building. 

TNSIDE, two youths in coveralls 
-*-were lounging on wooden chairs 
of austere design. One leaped to 
his feet at the sight of Carole. As 
he strode toward them, Winstead 
glanced over his shoulder to make 
sure of the door. 

Turning back, he was just in 
time to find the young man seiz- 
ing Carole in an enthusiastic 
embrace. The two melted to- 
gether in a passionate kiss. Then 
the young man stepped back, 
checked his wristwatch and 
dashed for the door. 

“Good night, kid,” he called to 
her over his shoulder. 

Carole waved jauntily. She 
took Winstead by the elbow. 

“That was Wilfie,” she ex- 
plained. “We’ll be getting married 
if we can ever get our job shifts 
straightened out. I hope I didn’t 
make him late, poor boy — it 
was his only chance to see me 
until tomorrow.” 

Winstead was hardly aware of 
having been steered into an 
elevator. When they reached the 
second floor, Carole led him a 
few steps along the hall. She used' 
a simple light-key to open an 
apartment door. Winstead fol- 
lowed her inside wordlessly. 

“Let me take your bag,” she 
said. “In here is the bedroom. I’ll 



bet you didn’t have that much 
room on the spaceship.” 

“Well . .” 

“Now let’s go in the kitchen 
and see what we can get you for 
dinner. I might as well feed you, 
since I figure to charge you fifty 
credits for the night.” 

Winstead remained silent by a 
considerable effort. 

He wondered what his expres- 
sion showed. Carole did not seem 
to notice anything. She prattled 
on about the folly of trying to 
find a room in one of the few 
hotels boasted by the city of 
Junction. Most of them, she 
claimed, would be full of carous- 
ing spacers. Meanwhile, she rum- 
maged through a frozen food unit. 

Winstead agreed to something 
in a foil package without know- 
ing what. She popped it into an 
automatic infra-red heater. He 
allowed himself to be led by the 
hand to a large chair in the living 
room. 

“There’s the entertainment 
program for the TV,” she told 
him. “Not that we have much 
here — most of it is old tapes 
from Terra. Make yourself com- 
fortable while I change.” 

She pattered off into the bed- 
room, leaving Winstead weighing 
the program in a limp hand. He 
looked around the room. There 
were two doors to rooms or exits 
he had not been shown. What he 
had seen or could examine from 



142 



GALAXY 



where he sat was very comfort- 
ably furnished, with a resilient 
carpet substitute from wall to 
wall and new-looking furniture of 
the simple Gelbchen style. Carole 
seemed partial to reds and other 
bright colors. Only the pastels of 
the walls had prevented a dis- 
aster. 

Is it worth fifty credits? he 
asked himself. On the other hand, 
if I go out looking for a hotel, 
will I just happen to have a hard 
time getting a ship? 

He glanced indecisively at 
the door to the bedroom into 
which Carole had vanished. It 
had been left slightly ajar. About 
the time he became aware of 
this, a tinny chime began to 
sound from the direction of the 
kitchen. 

It continued until Winstead 
realized that he would have to 
investigate for himself. He en- 
tered the kitchen to find that the 
automatic heater had flipped up 
a small sign saying, “Hot!” 

H E GUESSED the right button 
to get the door of the appli- 
ance open, looked around until 
he located a tray and tongs, and 
removed his dinner. Further 
search supplied him with cutlery. 
He opened the foil, discovering 
that he had chosen a meal of 
roast beef with mashed potatoes 
and two vegetables he had never 
seen on Terra. 



Carole still had not appeared, 
so he carried his tray out to the 
dining area, which was furnished 
with bronze-colored metal chairs 
and table. It looked like a dinner 
for one, he reflected, but he was 
on a strange planet. As he hesi- 
tated, the bedroom door was 
flung back and footsteps sounded 
behind him. 

“Go ahead and enjoy it,” called 
Carole. “Wine in the sideboard 
there. Then make yourself at 
home for the night.” 

Winstead turned. The girl was 
bending to zip the front of one 
shoe. She was clad in coveralls 
of a yellow that made Winstead 
blink. 

“I’m off,” she announced cheer- 
fully. “Got a second-shift job as 
an ambulance driver. I tell you, 
it’s one big rat race to meet ex- 
penses on Gelbchen II! It helps 
when I can bring home guests 
from the spaceport, but Wilfie 
wants me to cut that out when 
we get married.” 

She waved and bustled out to 
the elevator. 

Winstead wondered whether 
he had said good night. 

He discovered after some 
minutes that he was leaning on 
the table with one thumb in the 
hot potatoes. He sat down, ex- 
amining his thumb attentively. 
After due consideration, he licked 
off the potato, found a fork, and 
began to prod dubiously at the 



ROUND-AND-ROUND TRIP 



143 



local idea of vegetables . 

He awoke next morning 
with a start of surprise at finding 
himself in neither a net nor a 
padded compartment. The bed 
was soft. It invited him to roll 
over for another half hour’s 
snooze in the faintly perfumed 
room. 

Perfume? 

Bedroom . Carole! 

Winstead sat straight up as full 
memory returned. 

Everything was quiet. He 
threw back the electric blanket, 
checked a clock that must be set 
to planetary time, and decided 
that it was early morning. The 
window filters yielded to trial- 
and-error manipulation, flooding 
the room with cheerful sunlight 
not unlike that of a Terran sum- 
mer morning. Winstead walked 
softly to the door and opened it 
a crack. The room outside re- 
mained dim and silent. 

He washed in the adjoining 
bathroom and dressed rapidly. 
Feeling better prepared for the 
day, he sallied out to seek break- 
fast. The first sight that met his 
eyes was that of Carole sleeping 
on a couch under an aquamarine 
blanket she had plugged in at the 
socket of a floor lamp. 

The thought of fifty credits re- 
strained the impulse to pat her 
blonde head in commiseration. 
He thought of it a little more, 
thereby fighting down a mild at- 



tack of conscience over appropri- 
ating the bed. 

Alter all, he thought, here 1 
have to get my own breakfast. 
She’s probably tired out, but 
that’s the reward of moonlighting. 
Ifs her planet, not mine. 

W INSTEAD tiptoed to the 
kitchen door, slipped fur- 
tively through, and closed the 
door as quietly as possible behind 
him. 

Two men eating breakfast at 
a small table looked up at him 
amiably. 

“Gaagh!” said Winstead. 

“Good morning,” replied one 
man, who wore a rather feminine 
dressing gown. 

The other, a ruddy, farmerish 
individual, grunted past a mouth- 
ful of toast. 

“I beg your pardon,” Winstead 
said. 

“You must be another star 
traveler,” said the gentleman in 
the dressing gown. “We knew 
there must be one when we saw 
Carole on the couch. I hope she 
gets you out of here quicker than 
she’s finding a ship for me.” 
“You have been waiting for a 
spaceship?” Winstead asked. 

“Over two weeks now,” said 
the other. “The kid’s fair enough 
about it, I must admit. She can’t 
ship me toward Epseri, so she’s 
been giving me a discount on my 
room.” 



144 



GALAXY 



“Sit down and have some 
eggs,” invited the farmer type. 
“Brought ’em into town myself, 
along with my other produce.” 

Winstead eyed the platter of 
fried eggs. They were entirely too 
large to have come from chickens, 
but they looked good. He decided 
not to ask any questions. 

It developed after he joined 
them at the table that the farmer 
was in the habit of boarding with 
Carole whenever he came to 
Junction on business. The trav- 
eler, one Cecil Feigelson, excused 
his borrowing Carole’s robe on 
grounds of the scanty baggage 
allowed space travelers and the 
fact that he had been hanging 
about for so long. They assured 
him that he looked fine in pink. 

Winstead drained his cup of 
coffee substitute, considered hav- 
ing another. 

“You know,” he said thought- 
fully, “it hardly seems necessary 
to spend all that time finding a 
ship headed for Epseri. I — uh 
— happen to be going that way 
too. I suspect that a good, close 
look at the schedules down at 
the spaceport might show us a 
way.” 

“But Carole is the clerk in 
charge.” 

“I also happen to know a little 
about how it’s done,” said Win- 
stead quietly. He added, “From 
traveling so much you know.” 

“Well, if you think anything 

L "round-and-round 



can be done, I’m all for it.” 

“When the kid wakes up, she 
could drive you down,” suggested 
the farmer. 

“That should require only a 
moment to arrange,” said Win- 
stead, rising to fill a pitcher with 
ice water. Fifty credits a night! 
he thought. Wait till I get my 
hands on her shipping schedules! 

Hardly five minutes later, they 
all spilled out of the elevator into 
the lobby. Carole was still rather 
damp and angry. Cecil Feigelson’s 
suitcase zipper was only three- 
quarters closed. Fortunately, he 
was wearing pants under the girl’s 
dressing gown, which clashed 
horribly with Winstead’s rumpled 
orange suit. 

“Hey!” someone yelped as they 
blazed through the lobby. 

Young Wilfie catapulted from 
a chair where he appeared to 
have been dozing. 

Doesn’t he have a home? won- 
dered Winstead. 

T>Y THE time they reached 
Carole’s groundcar outside, 
the youth had somehow inserted 
himself into the group in place 
of the farmer. Winstead set the 
machine in motion while the 
others were scrambling for seats. 

“Do you know how to drive 
one of these, friend?” asked 
Feigelson. 

“I am an expert groundcar 
operator,” Winstead assured him. 

TRIP 



145 



Unfortunately, he was soon 
forced to admit, he was ac- 
customed to Terran cars that 
floated on cushions of air. Al- 
though bumps in the spaceport 
road encouraged a good deal of 
floating at the speed he was 
making, the Gelbchen vehicle was 
really designed for less intermit- 
tent wheel-to-ground contact. 

The trip seemed shorter, 
though, than it had the previous 
evening. Winstead skidded to a 
halt at their destination and dis- 
covered that he was perspiring 
slightly. His passengers were in 
a frank sweat and lost several 
yards trailing him into the ter- 
minal and over to the Agency 
counter. 

When they arrived, still quite 
pale, Winstead was already up to 
his elbows in shipping schedules 
and blank forms. A few passing 
clerks glanced curiously at Feigel- 
son’s frilly pink dressing gown, 
but they were used to outworld 
garb. 

“Wait! That’s my Galatlas 
you’re tearing apart!” Carole pro- 
tested breathlessly. 

“How would you know, my 
dear?” asked Winstead, riffling 
the pages furiously. “Hah! Just as 
I thought — this cruise ship 
down here for supplies, the Virgo, 
is listed to make New Ceres next. 
The Galatlas shows that New 
Ceres is halfway to Epseri, 
Feigelson!” 



“Wilfie!” wailed Carole. “Make 
him stop tearing the place apart 
like a saloon! Look at that stack 
of folders spilled all over the 
floor!” 

Wilfie bestirred himself, but he 
was handicapped by being on the 
other side of the counter with 
Carole and Feigelson. 

“What do you think you’re 
doing?” he demanded truculently. 
“Where did you come from, any- 
way?” 

“I came from Terra,” said Win- 
stead, pausing in filling out a 
form, “and I am more than ready 
to return. Combining a vacation 
with a business inspection trip 
occasionally becomes too exciting 
for a man of my years.” 

“Inspection trip?” echoed 
Carole, freezing. 

“My hobby,” said Winstead. 
“It keeps one in touch with the 
people who make the Agency go. 
This place, now, is the most slap- 
dash, disorganized — Young 
man! You quit one of your jobs 
and take over this branch of the 
Interstellar Travel Agency. Don’t 
argue — of course you can! What 
is your full name?” 

“ATe?” gasped Wilfie. “Wilfred 
Evans.” 

“All right, Evans, you’re hired. 
You’ll be able to get married 
and put a stop to all this non- 
sense of renting rooms while ships 
go out without our passengers.” 

“What authority have you to 



146 



GALAXY 



— ” began Carole indignantly. 

“The first test of a chief agent,” 
said Winstead, scribbling upon a 
business card, “is to know when 
to tell an assistant manager to 
button her hatch.” 

Wilfie accepted the card and 
glanced at both print and scrib- 
bling. 

“Button your hatch!” he or- 
dered Carole over his shoulder. 

CHE STOOD silent, her mouth 
k -' open about the same distance 
as Feigelson’s. Winstead looked 
about for a local clock, and 
snatched up one of the sheets 
strewn about the counter. A de- 
parture time listed upon it made 
him swear. He leaped to Carole’s 
phone, switching on sound and 
screen with one swipe of his 
thumb. 

The blonde advanced a timid 
step, to read the card bearing 
Wilfie’s appointment. 

“Robert Winstead Lewis, Terra 
. President, Interstellar Travel 
Agency . .” 

“Winstead” was shouting at a 
face on the phone screen. 

“You tell them who I am!” he 
demanded, holding up another of 
his cards to the scanner. “They’ll 
manage to hold the ship three 
minutes until we reach her!” 

He switched off, mopping his 
forehead with the back of his 
hand, and started around the 
counter. Carole swayed weakly 



against Feigelson’s supporting 
arm. 

“Now, then!” snapped Win- 
stead. “This branch will be 
checked in the near future, Evans. 
I trust that you are the sort of 
man who can show a firm hand, 
should he return home to dis- 
cover a star traveler in his 
bedroom.” 

He smacked the flat of his own 
hand significantly upon the 
counter, staring at Carole be- 
tween the eyes. Wilfie nodded 
thoughtfully. 

Robert Winstead Lewis flagged 
down an unwary porter driving 
by on an empty baggage truck. 

“Bring the bags, Feigelson!” he 
commanded, hopping aboard and 
seizing the controls. “As far as 
New Ceres, anyhow, we’ll be 
going first-class!” 

Picking up speed, the baggage 
truck squealed around a turn and 
headed for an exit to the space- 
port. The porter looked back 
with a horrified expression, the 
pink gown fluttered beside the 
orange suit one last time, and 
they disappeared through the 
portal. 

The air about the disorganized 
counter and reorganized agents 
continued to vibrate for some 
minutes. 

Finally, the distant roar of a 
ship lifting for space penetrated 
to restore a sense of relative 
peace. — H. B. FYFE 



ROUND-AND-ROUND TRIP 



147 



There were two varieties of 
aliens — blue and bluer — but 
not as blue as the Earthmenl 



By JIM HARMON Illustrated by WOOD 



E VEN if I’m only a space 
pilot, I’m not dumb. I 
mean I’m not that dumb. 
I admit that Dr. Ellik and Dr. 
Chon outrank me, because that’s 
the way it’s got to be. A pilot is 
only an expendable part. But I 
had been the first one to see the 
natives on this planet, and I was 
the first one to point out that 
they came in two attractive 
shades of blue, light blue and 
dark blue. 

Four Indigos were carrying an 



Azure. I called the others over 
to the screen. 

“A sedan chair,” identified Lee 
Chon. “Think the light-skinned 
one is a kind of a priest?” 

Mike Ellik shook his head. “I 
doubt it. The chair isn’t ornate 
enough. I think that’s probably 
the standard method of travel — 
at least for a certain social elite.” 
“Do you notice anything un- 
usual about those bully boys?” 
“You tell me what you see,” 
Ellik evaded. 



148 



GALAXY 



“Three of them are mongoloid 
idiots,” said Chon. 

“I thought so,” Ellik said, “but 
I wasn’t quite sure — aliens and 
all.” 

“They’re humanoids,” Chon 
said, “and humanoids are my 
specialty. I know.” 

“The fourth one doesn’t look 
much better.” 

“His features are slack and 
his jaw is loose, all right, but 
they aren’t made that way. It’s 
an expression he could change. 
His head isn’t shaped like that.” 

“Um. The man in the chair 
is a striking specimen. No cere- 
bral damage in him.” 

“I don’t think the answer is 
brain damage. If the ‘noble’ 
trusts those four to carry him, 
their actions and reflexes must 
be pretty well coordinated. They 
can’t have anything like palsy 
or epilepsy.” 

“They must breed a special 
type of slave for the job,” Ellik 
suggested. 

“They aren’t slaves, Mike,” I 
told him. 

“No?” Ellik said, like talking 
to a kid. “And what are they, 
Mike?” 

T BREATHED out hard, a 
■*- little disgusted that big brains 
like Ellik and Chon couldn’t see 
the translucent truth. “They are 
just four dumb slobs who can’t 
get a better job, so they are haul- 



ing His Highness around because 
they have to make a living the 
hard way.” 

“That doesn’t quite cover it, 
Johnny,” Chon said. “The car- 
riers are a completely different 
race.” 

“What’s different about them?” 
I asked. ‘They’ve got hands to 
work with, eyes to see with, 
noses to smell with. If you kick 
one of them, I bet he’ll hurt. 
It’s just their bad luck to be 
dumb slobs.” 

Ellik grunted. “Unfortunately, 
Johnny, there are subtler differ- 
ences. The darker aliens, the 
indigo-colored ones, seem to be 
definitely down further on the 
scale of local evolution. They 
must be an inferior race to the 
lighter, azure species.” 

Chon had been looking at us 
and listening to everything. Fin- 
ally he said, “You can’t be sure 
of that, Mike. You haven’t seen 
all of the Indigos. Some of them 
may not be as far down as the 
common carriers.” 

Ellik sighed. “Explorers have 
to make snap decisions on insuf- 
ficient data. We don’t have time 
to see the whole damned planet 
before we write up a report.” 
“Yes, explorers have to make 
snap decisions,” Chon repeated 
to himself. “Are you going to 
take a look at those buildings, 
see if it’s a village?” 

“I thought I’d see if our blue- 



BLUEBLOOD 



149 



blood friend out there wants to 
show it to me,” said Mike Ellik. 
“He won’t,” I said. 

They both looked at me. 

“You don’t have any chair and 
nobody to carry you,” I went on. 
“He’ll think you’re just a slob.” 
“Jonathan,” Ellik said, “you 
show occasional flashes of gen- 
ius.” 

I smiled and shrugged it off. 
“I know I’m not nearly as smart 
as you boys. But that doesn’t 
mean I can’t think at all.” 

Ellik clapped me on the 
shoulder. “Of course it doesn’t.” 
But his grip was too strong. 
“Johnny,” Ellik said gravely, 
“do you think you could carry 
me?” 

“Wait a minute. You want me 
to act like one of those slobs? 
That’s asking a lot.” 

“But could you?” 

“Not all the way to those 
buildings. What was the gravity 
reading, Lee?” 

C HON closed his eyes a second. 
“Point nine seven three.” 
“There!” I said. “I couldn’t 
tote you three or four miles pig- 
gy-back.” 

“Look,” Chon said, “we can 
strip down a magnetic flyer and 
you can ride the seat, Mike. 
Johnny can pretend to carry 
you, like on a platter. It’ll im- 
press the yokels with the 
strength of our flunkies.” 



“Mike could carry me,” I 
pointed out. 

Chon laid a delicate hand on 
my back. “But, buddy, Mike out- 
ranks you.” 

I shook my head. “Not that 
way, he doesn’t.” 

‘We may be going to a lot of 
trouble for nothing,” Mike said. 
“That gang may jump us as soon 
as we decant and try to have us 
for dinner.” 

“There’s always that risk,” 
Chon agreed solemnly, “but nat- 
urally I will remain on duty at 
the controls of the stun cannon.” 

“Securely inside,” Ellik added. 

“Always on duty,” Chon said. 

“Always inside,” Ellik said. 

“It’s in the records, Ellik. I 
took the last one.” Lee said it a 
little too sharp and it cut the kid- 
ding. 

“Go soak your soft head in 
brine,” Ellik said, disgruntled. 

‘Wait a minute,” Chon called. 

Ellik turned back. “Yeah?” 

“Don’t forget to take your 
communicator with you.” Chon’s 
voice was choked. “You may get 
out of line of sight if you go off 
with that troupe.” 

“I know this business,” Ellik 
said, turning away. 

“Mike, I’m sorry if I offended 
you. Shake, huh?” 

Ellik smiled sourly. “Forget 
it.” 

“Come on, shake.” 

“Okay, we’re buddies. Do I 



150 



GALAXY 



actually have to pump your 
clammy paw?” 

“Please!” 

“Oh, for Pete’s sake!” Ellik 
turned around and kissed Chon 
on the forehead. 

Ellik was just sore, of course. 
But the manual warns against 
that sort of horseplay when 
you’ve been out a long time. 

“Satisfied now?” Ellik asked. 

“No.” Chon’s voice was 
strained tight. “It should have 
been me to kiss you.” Chon 
turned to me. “Luck out there, 
Johnny.” 

I grabbed his hand and levered 
it fast, before he could decide 
I needed kissing. “Sure thing, 
Lee. Thanks.” 

T HE buildings weren’t much to 
see, but they were a step 
above primitive huts. They were 
adobe, or maybe plastic. The 
aliens understood the stress prin- 
ciples of the dome, Ellik said, 
because all the buildings had 
curved roofs. Unbaked pottery 
was what they looked like to me, 
and they looked as if they would 
be brittle as coffee-colored chalk. 
Actually, their ceramic surfaces 
were at least as hard as steel. 

The Azure had welcomed El- 
lik with an outstretched hand. 
Mike wasn’t one to jump to con- 
clusions, so he just held out his 
own hand. The native grabbed 
and let it go after pulling it some. 



The alien saw me apparently 
carrying Ellik on a seat cushion 
with one hand, and he kicked 
me in the leg. To test my mus- 
cles, I guess. I managed to keep 
from yelling or jumping. The 
Azure looked impressed and the 
Indigos did a bad job of hiding 
a lot of envy and hate. 

As the Indigos toted their man 
along on the litter and I guided 
Ellik’s seat cushion along the 
channel of magnetic feedback, the 
two riders began talking. Ellik’s 
translator collar broke the lan- 
guage barrier, of course. It was 
a two-way communicator on a 
direct hook-up to our cybernetic 
calculator on the ship. The brain 
analyzed the phonetic structure 
of the alien language under vari- 
ous systems of logic or anti-logic 
and fed the translation into El- 
lik’s ear. Then it went through 
its memory banks and played 
back the right sounds to trans- 
late Ellik’s talk into the alien 
language. I understand things 
like that. I’m a pretty good me- 
chanic. 

I didn’t have my translator 
turned on, but it seemed to me 
that somehow I could under- 
stand what the plug-uglies, the 
Indigos, were saying. 

Ellik told me that it was be- 
cause all their speech was based 
on the one universal humanoid 
sound, “mama.” Everything good 
in the way of norms and verbs 



BLUEBLOOD 



151 



(there were no other particles of 
speech) was some inflection of 
“m-m” and everything bad was 
“uh-m-m.” 

Ellik was pretty “uh-m-m.” 

I was plenty “uh-m-m.” I 
threatened their jobs, they 
thought. 

They were a real miserable 
bunch of slobs, those Indigos. 

We passed through the wide 
places between the houses — I 
wouldn’t call them streets — and 
saw a lot of Indigos crouched in 
doorways, watching us, and Az- 
ures being toted around. 

The clothing they wore was 
also pretty universal for sentient 
bipeds — a tunic or sarong, kind 
of. For the Azures, it was smooth 
and colorful; and for the Indigos, 
a loincloth of some rough, dun- 
colored stuff. 

Ellik chinned off his translator 
switch and leaned down toward 
my ear. “They are two distinct 
races, Johnny. Notice that all the 
Indigos are menials. There does 
not appear to be anything to cor- 
respond to a freedman or even 
a higher-ranked house servant. 
The Azures treat the Indigos only 
as animals.” 

“Slobs,” I said. “Poor dumb 
slobs.” 

The nuclear flash washed over 
us, peppering us with a few ex- 
cess roentgens. 

We couldn’t look at the space- 
ship going up, but we knew it 



was going. It was making a dawn. 

The aliens were all frightened. 
They fell on the ground and 
started praying to the ship, all 
of them, the Azures and the In- 
digos. 

‘What’s wrong with that crazy 
Chinaman?” Ellik yelped. 

“Lee knows what he’s doing,” 
I said. 

Ellik unsnapped his communi- 
cator from his belt. “Johnny says 
you know what you’re doing, 
Chon. Do you?” 

“I know.” Chon’s voice 
sounded right beside us, perfect- 
ly natural. Belt communicators 
work just as well as those con- 
soles. People only buy consoles 
for prestige. 

‘Well?” Ellik demanded. 
‘What are you doing, Lee?” 

I thought maybe something 
had gone wrong with the com- 
municator. 

Chon’s voice finally reached 
us. 

“I’m leaving you and Johnny 
on this planet, Mike,” he said. 

A N Indigo brought us in our 
morning supply of fruit. 

Ellik felt me looking at him. 
kicked the Indigo. “It’s overripe, 
blockhead. Amum, amum.” 

The Indigo backed out, bow- 
ing, eyes very round. 

Ellik felt me looking at him. 

‘Well, I don’t like kicking the 
oaf, but that’s all he’s been con- 



152 



GALAXY 




BLUEBLOOD 



153 



ditioned to understand as a sign 
of disapproval.” 

“Sure,” I said. 

Ellik passed through the sci- 
mitar of gray shadow into the 
sunlight that washed lines and 
years out of his face. He braced 
a hand against the doorframe 
and craned his head back. It 
stopped and steadied. 

“He’s still there,” Ellik said. 
“Sometimes I wish his orbit 
would decay enough to burn him 
up in this damned sour air.” He 
coughed into his fist. 

“He could probably correct,” 
I suggested. 

Ellik sneered. “He hasn’t got 
the brains.” 

“Pretty hard for one man to 
manage a takeoff. He was lucky 
to make it into orbit.” 

“I just wish he would come 
down. Somehow, someway, I’d 
get to him, no matter where he 
went on this planet.” 

“I suppose that’s why he stays 
up.” 

Ellik slammed his fist into his 
palm. “I’m going to call him 
again. He can’t get away without 
us. If he fouled up a takeoff that 
badly, he’s not going to try to 
solo into hyperspace.” 

“I don’t think anyone would 
solo into hyperspace. I don’t 
think he would be able to come 
back.” 

“Oh, what do you know about 
it?” Ellik said shortly. “He’s just 



building up his courage to try 
the big jump. He’s yellow, sure, 
but sooner or later he’ll get des- 
perate enough, or scared enough, 
to actually go. Then we’ll be 
stranded for fair. This planet may 
not be colonized for centuries!” 
“Probably never,” I said. “Not 
after Lee’s reports.” 

“You think he would falsify 
reports?” Ellik asked, blinking 
at me. 

“I suppose he’ll have to.” 

Ellik held his head with his 
hands. “Of course, of course. 
There’s no limit to the depths to 
which he would plummet.” He 
ran over to the corner and 
snatched a communicator off the 
pile of our gear. “I’m going to 
call him and tell him what I 
think of him and his wild ob- 
session.” 

I didn’t remind Ellik that he 
had been telling Chon just that 
at least once a day for a month. 
I knew his nerves got tighter and 
tighter and cussing out Chon 
helped release them and make 
him feel better. 

“Come down, Lee!” Ellik called. 
“The three of us can make the 
jump together. You’re martyring 
yourself for a crazy reason!” 
“We’ve talked this over be- 
fore,” Chon answered. “This is 
the last time I’m going to re- 
spond to your call. I’ve made it 
clear to you that I think knowl- 
edge of this world will cause 



154 



GALAXY 



great suffering, a lot of death, 
among the majority of Earth’s 
people.” 

“You’re talking prejudice, Lee! 
Your prejudice. People aren’t 
like that any more.” 

“We haven’t gone that far, 
Mike. The bigots, the hatemon- 
gers, the pettiness and xenopho- 
bia lurking in everybody haven’t 
been asleep that long. Just look 
at it from my side, Mike. What 
will the white people of Earth 
think about the Orientals, Ne- 
groes and Indians of Earth when 
they find out the dark-skinned 
humanoids of another planet are 
— measurably, unquestionably, 
vastly — inferior to the light- 
skinned race of the same world? 
I ask you, Mike!” 

lV/TIKE ELLIK said, “It’s an in- 
ept analogy, Lee, and you 
know it.” 

“But most people reason by 
analogy,” said Lee Chon. “No, 
Mike. I have to leave you and 
Johnny to prevent a recurrence 
of racial hatred, intolerance and 
all the ugly consequences on 
both sides. This is the last time 
I’ll answer you, Mike. I’m get- 
ting lonesome. In a few years, 
I’ll get hungry for human com- 
panionship. I don’t want to be 
tempted down. Good-by, Johnny. 
So long, Mike.” 

Ellik screamed. “Wait! An- 
swer one more call, Lee. It’s the 



least you can do for me. I don’t 
know when I’ll make it. It may 
be in a few weeks or a few years. 
It won’t be just argument, Lee. 
I’ll have something you’ll want 
to tell Earth about this place and 
these people.” 

“I’m still here. Tell it to me 
now,” Chon’s voice said. 

“No. I want to get proof. Let 
me rig up some kind of video 
circuit for you. I can use parts 
out of our tape camera and the 
translators. I want to get it all 
across to you.” 

I could hear Chon breathing. 
“Very well. I’ll answer your next 
call.” 

“Lee,” I called out, “Mike and 
me will be expecting you to an- 
swer.” 

Chon laughed. “I’m not going 
anywhere, Johnny. Only around 
this world every couple of 
hours.” 

“You couldn’t make the jump 
through hyperspace without us, 
Lee,” Ellik said. 

“That’s right, Mike. I’m — I’m 
sorry to quarantine you two 
down there.” 

“Quarantine!” Ellik stormed. 
“We’re not sick, Lee. You are the 
sick one!” 

There wasn’t any sound, not 
even of breathing. 

“You have an idea to change 
Lee’s mind, Mike?” I asked. 

He cupped his hand on the 
back of my neck. “Affirmative, 



BLUEBLOOD 



155 



Jonathan. A pretty damned good 
one, too.” 

Ellik stood staring out the 
door, gnawing on one of his 
knuckles, letting the sun turn the 
front of him into gold, so he 
looked like half a statue, and 
half a man. 

“I suppose it had to come out 
in him sooner or later,” he said. 

“What, Mike?” 

“What could we expect? It’s 
the basic quality of treachery in 
the Oriental mind.” 

W HEN the shadows were at 
their longest and the alien 
sun was down the closest to the 
horizon without actually going 
under, Ellik marched up the path 
shoving a new Indigo. The Az- 
ures supplied Mike with all the 
flunkies he wanted to gather 
food and the like for him, as 
his natural right. But I thought 
we had enough of them hanging 
around our quarters. I couldn’t 
imagine what he would want 
with another one. 

The alien hovered at the door. 
Ellik kicked him in the calf to 
make him understand he was to 
go inside. 

“Look at him, Johnny,” Ellik 
said, pushing the fellow forward. 
“Not a mongoloid, would you 
say?” 

“No.” 

The alien looked stupid — blue 
and stupid. His face was hanging 



there, but it wasn’t pushed out 
of shape any more than the faces 
of the Azures. The Indigo blink- 
ed back at me. What he also 
looked was not friendly. 

Ellik took the Indigo’s cheeks 
in his hand and angled the face 
toward the light. “He’s a half- 
breed, Johnny, or otherwise the 
gene was recessive. He wasn’t 
damaged before birth, only after 
— when he started to breathe.” 
“What do you mean, Mike?” 
“You ever hear of cyanosis, 
Johnny?” 

“No.” 

“Well, these creatures have 
something like it. The Indigos 
don’t get enough oxygen in their 
blood cells. It makes them slug- 
gish; it turns them blue like the 
pictures of ‘blue babies’ in the 
old books.” 

“I never saw a picture like 
that in an old book,” I said. 

“Did you ever see a book? 
Sorry, Johnny. Just kidding.” 
Ellik rubbed his hands to- 
gether. “Well! I theorized that 
there is no basic difference in the 
Azures and the Indigos except 
improper aeration of their blood. 
So, you see, an Indigo is only a 
sick Azure, and I am going to 
make this Indigo well.” 

“How can you do that?” 

“It’s simple,” Mike said irri- 
tably. “The Indigos must have a 
malformation of the heart caus- 
ing an abnormal communication 



156 



GALAXY 



between the venous and arterial 
side of the circulation system. A 
little surgery and I adjust a 
valve in the heart. No more com- 
munication. Proper aeration. 
Enough oxygen. The deep blue 
color goes, leaving only the 
lighter blue of the natural pig- 
mentation. The patient feels bet- 
ter, acts better, thinks better, 
looks better. In short, he is no 
longer an Indigo but an Azure.” 
“Is — is this what you’re going 
to show Lee?” I ventured. 

“Of course! It proves the In- 
digos aren’t an inferior race. 
They are the same as the Azures 
except that they are sick. Their 
being sick can’t reflect unfavor- 
ably on any terrestrial colored 
race. There is no analogy. But I 
have to prove it to Chon. We’re 
going to tape the whole process 
and feed it to him.” 

“I think,” I said, “that that 
might get to him.” 

“Sure if will.” Ellik’s jaw mus- 
cles flexed. “I should ruin Lee 
with this thing, but I won’t. I’m 
not a vindictive man. Lee and I 
will probably be working to- 
gether for years. But whenever 
he gets out of line — has some 
stubborn idea about doing some- 
thing his way — don’t think I 
won’t remind him of this!” 

Suddenly, he was smiling 
again. He turned to the gawking 
Indigo. He pointed two fingers 
at him. 



“Mmr?” Ellik asked. 

The alien tapped himself on 
his chest cavity twice. “Mhaw,” 
he gave his name. 

‘‘Mhaw M’i uh M’i m M’rri- 
uh?” Ellik asked him, without 
even using the translators. 

“M-m-M-m-M,” the alien went, 
slapping himself on the chest 
with his opened palms. 

Ellik turned to me, grinning. 
“I asked him if he wanted to 
stop being an Indigo and become 
an Azure. He thinks I can do 
anything and he’s all for it.” 

A FTER we fed Mhaw a dose 
of null-shock from our packs, 
Doc Ellik started to slice him 
open with a ceramic knife he had 
borrowed from the Azures. 

But Ellik had forgotten that 
the alien might get frightened 
seeing himself cut open, even if 
he couldn’t feel any pain. It had 
never happened to him before. 

The alien lumbered to his feet, 
his chest hanging open, showing 
his heart beating like some animal 
caught inside a blueberry pud- 
ding. 

I drove a right cross into his 
jaw, and felt the jar all the way 
up to my shoulder. 

He melted back down onto the 
pallet. 

“Good work, Johnny,” Ellik 
said, stooping and starting his 
work. 

Right away, Mhaw started to 



BLUEBLOOD 



157 




lose that Indigo color and get 
real light — lighter than the 
Azures, in fact. None of the blue 
of the race was actually in the 
pigmentation, Mike found out. 
Even the Azures suffered some 
degree of improper aeration of 
the blood. 

“You going to call Lee Chon 
now?” I asked Mike. “You going 
to show him the tape we had 
running during the operation and 
all?” 

“Not quite yet, Johnny,” he 
said. “First I want to educate 
Mhaw a bit, up to the Azure 
level or better. That should con- 
vince Lee.” 

Mhaw learned fast, probably 
faster than the Azures, even. Al- 
most the first thing he wanted 
was for us to stop calling him 
Mhaw and start using an Azure 
name, Aedo. 

Once a day, Ellik left our hut 
to take some exercise — a walk 
along the alien esplanade, he 
called it. I used to stay with the 
doctored alien, now Aedo, but 
we finally learned we could trust 
him to follow our orders — which 
were to stay inside, away from 
the others, since we didn’t know 
how they would take him. So I 
got to walking along with Ellik. 

As dusk lengthened, we could 
see the spark that was our ship 
in its orbit along the retreating 
horizon. 

Ellik twisted back his head 



and the side of his mouth. “Look 
at him up there — look!’’ 

The spark burned brighter 
and danced in another direction. 

“He’s gone! He left us!” Ellik 
said. 

“It’s okay. He’s still there. Just 
corrected the orbit a little, I 
guess.” 

“No, no, no,” Ellik said. “He 
started to make another try. But 
he got afraid to try to go into 
hyperspace alone.” 

“He was just correcting for or- 
bital decay.” 

“You don’t understand, John- 
ny. He’s a coward. That makes 
him dangerous. He’s getting des- 
perate. That desperation will 
burst the dam of his own weak- 
ness and wash away our hope, 
our lives.” 

His voice hushed. He stood 
staring starkly ahead, his palms 
outstretched at his sides. 

“Maybe he isn’t that cow- 
ardly,” I said hopefully. 

UtMNISHED,” Ellik an- 
nounced. He meant he had 
finished editing the tape showing 
the operation on the alien and 
his recovery from his blue dis- 
ease, from being an Indigo to 
better than an Azure. 

“The transmitter is finished 
too,” I said. 

Ellik had suggested a way of 
switching the tape camera to a 
video converter for one of the 



BLUEBLOOD 



159 



audio communicators, and I had 
been able to do it easy. It took 
parts from both our communica- 
tors and translators too. 

Ellik fitted the coiled snake of 
tape into place. “This will be a 
great day for your people, Aedo. 
After our friend from heaven 
lands, we will be able to teach 
you a way to cure all of your 
sick, to make all the Indigos like 
you.” 

“Like me? Make like me?” 
Aedo said in the pidgin terres- 
trial that Mike Ellik had taught 
him. 

“Yes. We’ll show them how 
we cured you and how all can be 
cured.” 

“You make show fellow like 
me? Make tell make that fellow 
like fellow like me?” 

“Everything’s ready, Mike,” I 
called. 

“That’s right, Aedo,” Mike 
said. “You’ll show your people 
the way to equality.” 

“Make all fellow like this fel- 
low?” Aedo asked. 

“Shall I call in Lee?” I asked 
Mike. 

“Yes, that’s right, Aedo. Just 
right.” 

“No,” Aedo said. 

The alien stomped the tape 
camera and the communicator 
to bits before I could get a ham- 
merlock on him. 

Ellik just stared at the com- 
plete wreck of our only means 



of communication with the space- 
ship. 

“I be much man now. I much 
smart. Much smart than Azure 
hicks and Indigo slobs. I much 
smart all. I much man! Not to 
be all same now. No.” The snarl 
hung on in Aedo’s throat. 

Ellik lifted his head and sort 
of smiled. But not quite. 

“Well,” he said slowly and sad- 
ly, “what could you expect in the 
way of gratitude from a dirty 
alien?” 

T^HE Azures did accept Aedo 
all right. They seem to 
think he must have come from 
some other tribe. They don’t as- 
sociate him with the Indigo that 
disappeared. No Indigo ever be- 
came an Azure before. 

Of course, Azures sometimes 
become Indigos, we found out. 

It seems there’s a virus of 
what Ellik called pseudo-cyan- 
osis in the air. The Azures have 
become a pretty resistant breed 
to it, while the Indigos are all 
easy victims. But once in a while 
an Azure will come down with it 
and turn Indigo. 

Mike Ellik caught it too. 

It happened pretty fast. By 
the time we realized what it was, 
he was already too stupid to fin- 
ish the operation he started on 
himself. I had to sew him up, 
not very neatly. 

Ellik is treated pretty much 



160 



GALAXY 



like the rest of the Indigos. So 
am I. He takes it all pretty calm. 
He can still talk a little Earth. 
Whenever anybody kicks him, 
Ellik just mutters something 
about, “What can fellow expect 
bunch lousy creeps like those 
fellow?” 

I guess I’ll get it too. I think 
I am getting it. 

It won’t be so bad for me. Just 
like maybe going around drunk 
all the time, not being able to 
think or coordinate very well. 

It will be kind of bad being a 



member of an inferior race, but 
the thing I’ll hate about it the 
most isn’t that, or even leaving 
old Lee up there, circling around 
and waiting for our call forever. 

No, the thing I hate is having 
it happen now, just when I’m 
beginning to learn something. 

I’m not dead sure I know just 
exactly what I learned, but I 
think maybe I do: 

You get just what you damned 
well expected all along from a 
bunch of blue-blooded mongrels!

FORECAST 

Deep in the affections of all true lovers of science fiction is a lady 
author named Evelyn E. Smith, astonishingly and rewardingly intelligent, 
witty, inventive and resourceful, yet, pretty as Rima of Green Mansions, she 
is every bit as elusive as that most exasperating of fictional creations. 

In other words, strapping her to the typewriter is a real job, but one 
from which we have not flinched between each and every one of her 
stories. 

This announcement, then, is to call attention to our unexpectedly great 
success in extracting an entire novella from her — no little bitty item but a 
real story, cleverly plotted, touchingly characterized, gracefully and tellingly 
told, with a logic that should confound those who believe women and logic 
are incompatible — a silly dogma we don't hold to, but especially in Evelyn 
E. Smith's case. 

Called SENTRY OF THE SKY, her novella concerns Sub-Archivist Clarey, 
who is convinced that there must be a way to get up in the world, and 
indeed there is — but who'd ever think this was it? 

End of announcement, except that everything else in the issue will be 
a bonus, an Evelyn E. Smith story being worth the price of admission. Oh, 
and we're at her for more, and will continue until she brings one forth, at 
which point we will repeat the process. Ad, if necessary, infinitum.

Had they sold him a pup? 



BAD MEMORY 



BY PATRICK FAHY illustrated by MARTIN 



E X-VECTOR Commander 
Jim Charming strode pur- 
posefully to the reception 
desk of Planet Enterprises, Inc. 

“I want,” he told the well-built 
blonde who was making an in- 
terested survey of his lean 
features, “to buy a planet.” 

“Yes, sir.” Her interest evap- 
orated. She took a card from a 
filing cabinet and handed it to 
him. “If you will just fill this 
out” 

It was a simple questionnaire 
— type, location, size — and 
Channing’s stylo moved rapidly 
over it. He hesitated only at the 
last, stark question, “How much 
are you prepared to pay?” Then 
he wrote neatly in the space pro- 
vided “One hundred thousand 



credits.” That was exactly the 
amount of his signing-off bonus. 
It also represented his total 
finances. The unimaginative 
minds that calculated the pay of 
a red-blooded space officer didn’t 
take into account all the attrac- 
tive ways of spending it that a 
rumbustious pioneer Vector pro- 
vided. 

He gave the blonde the card 
and she wrote a name on it. The 
smile she gave him was alto- 
gether impersonal. She liked the 
look of the big, gangling fellow 
with “Space” written all over his 
bronzed face and crinkled blue 
eyes, but . 

She said, “Will you come this 
way, please?” 

The name on the desk identi-

fled him as “Mr. Folan” and he 
was a tall, affable man. 

“I think we can suit you. 
Commander — er — Mr. Chan- 
ning,” he said, “though what we 
have in mind mightn’t be quite 
as large as you wish. Earth-type 
planets come rather high, you 
know. Now if you were to choose 
a Sirius- or a Vega-type — ” 

“Thank you, no,” Jim said 
firmly. He had heard too much 
about the hazards of alien-type 
planets. 

“In that case,” Mr. Folan said 
busily, “let’s see what we have 
available.” 

A MONTH later the doors of 
■*"*-the automatic shuttle slid 
across and admitted Jim Chan- 



ning to the third planet of 
Phylox Beta. It also disgorged 
one spaceboat, a clutter of 
machinery, a thousand tons of 
strawberry plants and a fully 
equipped house. While he was 
still taking in the first glimpse 
of his future home, the massive 
doors slammed shut and the 
giant ship took off smoothly and 
silently. A moment later it 
winked into sub-space. He was 
in business. 

The planet possessed only one 
sizable island — it could hardly 
be dignified by the name of con- 
tinent. 

The rest was covered by a 
vast ocean. Still, as Folan had 
explained, he couldn’t really ex- 
pect anything more — not in the 



BAD MEMORY 



163 




line of an Earth-type, anyway — 
for the money. 

He spent a week figuring out 
the remote controls that oper- 
ated the planting machinery. 
Once it clanked into operation, 
it worked entirely on its own. He 
had only to push a few buttons 
to send it lumbering in new di- 
rections and the big island 
steadily took on a resemblance to 
a huge strawberry patch while 
Channing fished and lounged in 
the sun. 

When the galactic trade agent 
came, the strawberries were wait- 
ing for him, neatly piled into a 
mountain of gleaming cans. He 
was a friendly, talkative little 
man, glad to exercise his tongue 
again after the lonely months in 
space. 

“What are you growing here?” 
he asked Channing. 

“Strawberries.” 

The friendly smile disap- 
peared. “Every planet in the 
Galaxy seems to be growing 
strawberries this year. I can’t 
even give them away.” 

“But I thought the Ursa Major 
colonies — ” 

The little man shook his head. 
“So does everyone else. There’s 
a million tons of strawberries 
the colonies can’t use headed 
there already. Now if it was 
upklin seeds — ” 

“Upklin seeds?” 

The agent looked at him in 



surprise. “You mean you haven’t 
heard about upklin seeds?” 

“No. Not a thing.” 

‘Well, of course, you are a 
newcomer. It’s this new race 
that’s been discovered some- 
where in The Sack. They are as 
rich as all get-out and they have 
a passion for upklin seeds. 
Trouble is they can’t grow them 
on local planets and they are 
offering fancy prices to anybody 
that can supply them. I paid a 
thousand credits a bushel for 
them to your next-door neighbor 
on the fourth planet last week. 
Got a hundred bushels.” 

Channing did a bit of mental 
arithmetic. A hundred thousand 
credits for one crop. Whew! 
“Could I grow them here?” 
The agent shook his head. 
“You need plenty of soft marsh 
and a Jupiter-type atmosphere.” 
Then he had a sudden idea 
and he spoke long and seriously 
to Channing, explaining quite a 
few things that were new to him. 
Channing was still considering 
them, staring thoughtfully at 'the 
ground, after the little man left. 

TVTEXT DAY Channing took off 
■*- ’ for the nearest sub-space 
center and a few hours later he 
was in Mr. Folan’s office at 
Planet Enterprises, gingerly bal- 
ancing his cap on his knee. Mr. 
Folan’s sleek head nodded as 
Channing made his points and 



164 



GALAXY 



when he was finished the execu- 
tive pressed a buzzer and called 
for the file. 

“You realize, Mr. Channing,” 
he said conversationally, as he 
turned over the pages, “that what 
you are asking will be a most ex- 
pensive undertaking.” 

“I know that,” Channing said 
eagerly, “but upklin seeds are 
such a sure-fire proposition that 
I thought Planet Enterprises 
might be willing to do the job on 
a percentage basis.” 

Mr. Folan wrote some figures 
on the margin of the folder and 
considered deeply. “Yes,” he said 
at last, “I think it would work 
out on a seventy-thirty split.” 
“Seventy-thirty?” 

Mr. Folan inclined his head 
graciously. “Seventy per cent for 
Planet Enterprises and thirty 
for yourself.” 

Channing said slowly “That’s 
a bit steep.” 

In a few brisk words, Mr. 
Folan showed just why he was 
an executive of Planet Enter- 
prises, Inc. He gave Channing 
the figures for transforming the 
planet’s characteristics to those 
of Jupiter; he told him what 
acreage of upklin seeds he could 
grow and the exact profit to 
be expected. Channing’s share 
should be about one hundred 
and fifty thousand credits per 
crop. 

Fighting a rearguard battle, 



Channing said, “Your three 
hundred and fifty thousand won’t 
look so bad on the balance sheet, 
either.” 

Folan reeled off his figures 
again with practiced glibness. 
Channing had the sudden suspi- 
cion that his proposition wasn’t 
entirely unexpected. But the 
figures sounded reasonable and 
he had to admit that Planet 
Enterprises was risking a great 
deal of money. 

“Then there is the not incon- 
siderable cost of your own 
metamorphosis, Mr. Channing,” 
Folan added. 

“Huh?” said Channing. 

There followed the most ex- 
cruciating half-hour of Chan- 
ning’s life. Proposition followed 
explanation, counter-explanation 
followed counter-proposition. At 
the end of that time he emerged 
from the office with a stricken 
look and a small white card. The 
blonde receptionist read the look 
correctly and definitely and fi- 
nally crossed him off her list 

rX)R A JUBE, Ckm Dyk wasn’t 

at all bad-looking. His four 
legs growing directly from the 
bottom of the muscular, hairy 
trunk were strong and sturdy — 
always a mark of handsomeness 
in a male, for the legs had to take 
most of the strain of a gravita- 
tional pull several times that of 
Earth. He had three flexible ten- 



BAD MEMORY 



165 



tacles, a thin melon slice for a 
mouth, but nothing resembling 
a nose. He didn’t need one, since 
he breathed through a set of gills 
at the sides of his head. 

He remembered vaguely that 
he had once been Jim Channing, 
an Earthman, but the memory 
had nearly faded. He had been 
warned of that, that he would 
soon forget he had ever been 
anything except what he was 
now, but he had already forgot- 
ten the warning. 

Phylox Beta III had changed, 



too, and in as great a degree. The 
wide ocean had become a turgid, 
soupy mush, covered by the 
trailing growths of the upklin 
flowers. The blue skies had 
turned an angry red and the 
sharp wind that rustled the hair 
on his squat body was almost 
pure methane. 

He waddled down to the low 
disk-shaped skimmer and started 
the jets. As it pushed its way 
through the clinging masses of 
the upklin flowers, he surveyed 
his crop happily. This was his 



I 

| second crop and it promised to 
j be even better than the first. He 
was going to be a very wealthy 
buk, he told himself. He could 
. buy . His mind floundered. He 
didn’t know what Jubes longed 
for, what they sought wealth for. 
I He was certain at the same time 
I that there was a flaw in his con- 
I tentment, that something was 
I missing 

What he was missing dropped 
I from the sky a few days later. It 
came in a spaceboat and was his 
neighbor from Phylox Beta IV. 



Her body hair was a rich golden 
brown and she wore pretty 
bracelets, studded with basim 
stones, on each of her four legs. 
Ckm Dyk’s single eye, with its 
perpendicular outer eyelids and 
horizontal nictitating inner mem- 
branes to filter out the infra-red 
rays, shone with an emotion that 
was more than pleasure. 

Her thoughts flooded his mind. 
There was a warm recognition of 
his admiration and a delicious 
suggestion that it wasn’t unac- 
ceptable. 




“The agent told me you were 
upklin farming. I came to see if 
I could be of any help,” she told 
him. 

The sentences rang like 
golden bells within his burgeon- 
ing consciousness. He tried to 
shape his answering thought 
coherently, but his lack of tele- 
pathic experience betrayed him. 
She flinched momentarily be- 
neath the raw, undirected stream 
of passionate love that over- 
whelmed her mind. 

Then an answering wave of 
shy, tender awareness and acqui- 
escence laved his senses. With- 
out the clumsy barrier of speech 
between them, they had scaled 
in a few pulsating moments the 
shining heights of love and 
devotion that human passion 
sometimes cannot find in a life- 
time of searching. 

Ckm Dyk had never been so 
happy. They decided to farm 
the two planets together so they 
could be with each other always. 
There was sound economic sense 
in this; with both of them help- 
ing, the output of each planet 
would be nearly doubled. It 
meant a huge increase in admin- 
istrative and paper work for 
Ckm Dyk, but he didn’t mind 
that. Often, as he pored over 
account books and production 
figures, a tremulous, shy devotion 
would envelop him in a gauzy 
mental cloud and he would lay 



down his stylo and answer Ain 
Muh with all the great love that 
surged within him. 

As the months passed, his hap- 
piness increased. The perfect 
attunement of their minds ex- 
cluded all the scalding jealousies 
and the offended silences of mis- 
understanding that can mar the 
most loving human relationships. 
They did not need to see each 
other; the physical presence of 
the beloved was unimportant; 
they loved more with their minds 
than with their bodies. 

It seemed improbable that 
such a glorious idyl should 
ever be disturbed. Then, one 
morning, a shuttle-spacer came 
silently out of the red sky and 
landed beside the house. Ckm 
Dyk waddled toward it, impelled 
by a carefully built-in series of 
reflexes which he had completely 
forgotten about and entered its 
gaping maw. He never once 
looked at Ain Muh and the pas- 
sionate entreaties that echoed 
through his mind only roused in 
him a dull irritation. 

J IM CHANNING again found 
himself in Mr. Folan’s office. 
The figures the tall, sleek- 
haired man was reading out to 
him made tuneful music. Even 
when Planet Enterprises’ mas- 
sive deduction was made, his 
share was comfortingly more 
than a million.

GALAXY 



“Not bad payment, Mr. Chan- 
ning, for five years of life! In any 
case, it’s all over now — just a 
bad memory.” 

The executive smiled at him 
from his comfortable, familiar 
chair, aware of the torrents of 
confused thoughts hidden behind 
the gray eyes. 

When he had come out of the 
stupor that succeeded the almost 
disintegrating effects of his re- 
metamorphosis, Jim Channing 
remembered clearly the terms of 
the bargain he had made. He was 
to become a Jube, a living night- 
mare, living in a nightmare 
world, for five years. At the end 
of that time, Planet Enterprises 
promised him, he would be given 
back his humanity and he would 
have earned enough money to 
keep him in luxury for the rest 
of his life. 

They had kept their promise 
— to the letter. He felt it un- 
grateful of him that his para- 
mount emotion was fury. He had 
been happy; no human attach- 
ment could ever make him as 
happy again. He longed for the 
glorious love and trust he had 
shared during that tremendous 
five years. Perhaps he had been 
a repulsive monster from whom 
any woman would run screaming. 
But he didn’t want a woman. He 
wanted Ain Muh. 

He said, picking his words 
with the greatest care, “Would 



a further metamorphosis be pos- 
sible?” 

T^OLAN’S jaw dropped. It was a 
question he’d never expected 
to hear from any of the men 
who had taken the terrible choice 
for the glittering reward he held 
out to them. Most of them had 
picked up their vouchers and 
asked the way to the nearest 
tavern; many of the alien races 
did not find alcohol compatible 
with their metabolisms. A few 
had inquired tentatively about 
his current receptionist. Planet 
Enterprises had a big turnover in 
pretty receptionists, but they 
didn’t lose them to men who had 
been unhuman horrors for five 
years. One big red-haired char- 
acter had wanted to start a pri- 
vate war against the Sirians, 
whose brother he had been until 
two days previously. But none of 
them had wanted to go back. 

He said, “It’s possible, Mr. 
Channing. But I must tell you 
that a second metamorphosis is 
very expensive — and it’s per- 
manent.” 

“You mean if I become a Jube 
again, I must stay one?” 

The executive nodded. 
Channing gestured toward the 
payment voucher. 

“You said it was expensive. Is 
there enough there to cover it?” 
Folan looked curiously at him. 
“Yes, more than enough.” 



BAD MEMORY 



169 



He waited to hear what the 
big man would say next. 

Channing licked dry lips. A 
terrible doubt assailed him. 
Maybe Ain Muh had been 
metamorphosed too. Maybe she 
had returned to her former self 

— whatever that may have been 
— while he sat here. 

He looked down at the big, 
freckled hands resting on his 
knees. They were trembling and 
his palms felt moist Without 
looking up, he asked, “Is the 
period of metamorphosis, always 
for a term of five years?” 

“Invariably. No other term is 
possible in the present state of 
our knowledge of the technique 

— except permanency.” 

A great sigh escaped Chan- 
ning. That was all right, then. 
Ain Muh was genuinely a Jube. 
The agent had told him about 
her — mentioned her by name, 
he remembered now — had said 
that she was upklin farming on 
the neighboring planet. If she 
had been metamorphosed, she 



would have been taken from him 
more than a year ago. 

He tossed his cap on the table 
decisively and stood up. 

“All right. I’ll take the per- 
manent treatment.” 

/^KM DYK sucked the meth- 
ane through his gills with 
satisfaction. It was good to be 
home again. He had forgotten 
already that he had ever been 
Jim Channing, that he would 
never be human again. 

He did not know that less than 
five minutes after the shuttle- 
ship had borne him off to 
Galactic Enterprises, Ain Muh 
had sent her spaceboat hurtling 
toward the fiery orb of Phylox 
Beta, mad with the grief of hav- 
ing lost him. It would not have 
concerned him much if he had 
known. 

Jubes make tender and de- 
voted lovers, but they are no- 
torious for their exceedingly bad 
memories.

City Zone State — 




By DANIEL F. GALOUYE Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 



Space combat was what I'd been trained tor. 
I had wangled the job. Now all I had to do 
was find out what I was supposed to combat. 



I did and he did and so here I 
was checking in at the ICC Out- 
post on Darian Four. 

Lieutenant Barlow closed the 
facsimilograph folder, rose, kicked 
the leg of his desk just for the 
hell of it, walked over to the 
window and stared out at the 
black, dripping sky. 

“Dykes,” he said, “you’ve just 
finished a tour of duty on Well- 
borne. Right?” 

“Right.” 

“Fighting Wispies. Right?” 
“Right.” 

T^OR GOOD measure, he kicked 
a doorstop. “There are two 
hundred and sixty-three active 
fronts in this war. Right?” 

I smiled. “If you don’t count 

173 



LAD TO have you 
■ aboard, Dykes.” The 
Officer of the Day 
impaled my orders on his “pro- 
cess” spike and gave me the 
once-over. 

The nameplate on his desk 
read “Lieutenant Stephen Barlow, 
ICC” — Interstellar Combat 
Corps. His face was thin and his 
eyes jumpy, as though habitually 
searching for cover. He must have 
been young, being only a lieu- 
tenant, but his hair was almost 
all gray. 

He thumbed through the fac- 
similograph of my service records. 
“I see you’ve had duty in this 
sector before.” 

“On Wellborne, the next sys- 
tem rimward,” I lied — to the 



same extent that my records did. 

“Which is also in the Wispie 
penetration area . .” He left it 
hanging. 

“That’s right.” It was all I 
could think of to say. And that 
was enough for a man who 
wouldn’t recognize a Wispie if he 
met one face to face. 

Let me fill you in on the de-

the Battle of the Bureaus.” 

His face remained sober, lit up 
anew every few seconds by an- 
other bolt of lightning. From 
what I had gathered, there were 
more storms going on at any 
given second in the Darian sky 
than on any other planet. 

“And,” he went on, “even right 
now you could be checking in 
for a slice of duty Solarside. 
Right?” 

I nodded. But my attention 
had suddenly become riveted on 
an ashtray that seemed to have 
gotten a bad case of jitters. Under 
its own power, it was clattering 
around on top of the desk. 

“Then why in hell would a 
man like you decide, voluntarily, 
on another tour in the Wispie 
sector?” he demanded. 

By now the tray was jumping 
up and down, spilling ashes all 
over everything. But Barlow ig- 
nored it. 

“I guess I just wasn’t through 
fighting Wispies,” I answered. 

Which evidently wasn’t the 
right thing to say, for he looked 
at me as though I had messed up 
my orbit. 

Across the room, an orderly 
watched the tray slam up and hit 
the ceiling. Then he went over 
and placed a small, white object 
on the desk. It looked like a 
piece of bone carved in the shape 
of a cross with legs. The ashtray 
quieted down. 



“On the other hand, maybe 
we ought to be thankful you’re 
here.” Barlow kicked out at the 
leg of a chair. “If you came 
through one hitch against the 
Wispies, you might be able to 
show us a thing or two about 
fighting ’em.” 

He snatched up my orders 
and strode for the door. “I’ll have 
these rushed over tt> the Old 
Man. He’s waiting to welcome 
you aboard.” 

The orderly watched Barlow 
leave, then shrugged. “Don’t mind 
the lieutenant. He just volun- 
teered for the PM Detail. Bet 
you had some damned good PMs 
on Wellborne.” 

“Pretty good.” I had to keep 
up the deception. “Taut bunch 

— capable, efficient.” 

He grinned. “Real fighting 
spirit?” 

“Best in the Corps.” 

He elbowed my ribs and 
roared, laughing. I had to smile 
too. If I didn’t, he might suspect 
I had no idea what a PM Detail 
was. 

But just then the windows 
started shattering — pane after 
pane, left to right, top to bottom 

— until there wasn’t a square of 
glass left in the office. 

The orderly choked down his 
laughter, swore, performed an 
odd ritual with gesturing hands 
and ducked down behind the 
desk.

GALAXY 



STRIKING out across the drill 
^ field, I headed for the Skip- 
per’s office. There was a brisk 
wind and I stepped up the power 
of my rain shield to keep from 
getting drenched. 

The word “miserable” would 
hardly do justice to Darian Four’s 
weather. Take right now: Despite 
a downpour, the wind was 
screeching past the buildings. 
And whenever it managed to die 
down, it only moderated to a 
doleful moaning. The incessant 
lightning was something fierce 
and the thunder jarred your teeth 
out of their sockets. 

Abruptly I found myself re- 
membering the swastika-shaped 
bone the orderly had tossed be- 
side the cantankerous ash tray. 
Then I realized why my thoughts 
had returned to that object: The 
buildings themselves were laid 
out in the form of a swastika, 
with a gas flare burning at each 
angle and end of the figure. 

I wanted to ask the next man 
I saw what was the meaning of 
the symbolism — if that’s what 
it was. But if Wellborne, the 
place I had allegedly just come 
from, was also in the Wispie 
sector, then maybe I was sup- 
posed to know about these things. 

Anyway, the next person I saw 
was apparently in no position to 
answer questions. A noncom, he 
was hightailing it across the field, 
not even aware that he’d forgot- 

FIGHTING SPIRIT 



ten to turn his shield on and was 
getting drenched. 

With the next burst of light- 
ning, I saw his face. And if I 
hadn’t known ICC Corpsmen 
were supposed to be “stout- 
hearted, intrepid” (or so the 
videoposters say), I would have 
sworn he was near panic. He 
finally lunged into one of the 
buildings and slammed the door 
behind him. 

I shrugged uncertainly, won- 
dering whether I had done the 
right thing finagling duty on 
Darian. 

There was a tap on my 
shoulder and I turned. But no- 
body was there. While I stared 
in that direction, there was a 
prodding finger dug into my 
other arm. Still nobody. 

Frowning, I pushed on across 
the field. About the only thing I 
was looking forward to now was 
checking in at BOQ after paying 
my respects to the Old Man. 
Bachelor Officers Quarters, its 
windows ablaze with warmth and 
cheer, was like a welcoming 
beacon among the other decrepit 
buildings. And I felt thankful 
that, no matter what, the ICC 
always gave its officers the best 
accommodations possible. 

Lieutenant Barlow stepped out 
of the Skipper’s quarters just as 
I mounted the steps. He glanced 
at me, shook his head pityingly 
and started back for the OD’s 



175 



shack. I noticed he had his 
fingers crossed on both hands and 
there was a circular mirror 
dangling from a ribbon around 
his neck. 

I watched him make his way 
across the field — kicking a 
stone, taking four or five steps to 
catch up with it, kicking it again. 

Odd habit that Barlow had. 
And I wondered what was behind 
it. But then I remembered the 
orderly had explained it already 
with, “Don’t mind the lieutenant; 
he just volunteered for the PM 
Detail.” 

HTHE Old Man, Colonel “War- 
head” Mason, studied me 
with eyes of sad steel that seemed 
to be hiding the memory of hap- 
pier days. He was a compact, 
wiry little guy whose nickname 
was a perfect fit. One more thing: 
He was the only Corpsman I’d 
seen on Darian who didn’t have 
gray hair. There was a reason, 
though: He had none at all. 

Warhead indicated a chair. 
“Damned happy to have you with 
us, Dykes.” He jerked his head 
around and stared at the wall 
behind him. At first, I thought he 
had seen a Wispie. 

“Nice to be with you, sir.” I 
sniffed. There was a peculiar 
smell, but I couldn’t identify it. 

“I don’t know what the situa- 
tion is on Wellborne,” he con- 
tinued, “but we’re having a hell 



of a time handling things here.” 

He pressed a stud and the far 
wall blazed with the features of 
a contour map. 

“In the mountains north of 
here,” he went on, glancing nerv- 
ously over his shoulder again, 
“the enemy is trying to establish 
a foothold.” 

An arrow of illumination 
speared across the map to indi- 
cate the spot. “We’ve thrown 
them back six times. But they’re 
damned tough.” 

Still crinkling my nose at the 
sharp odor, I took inventory of 
the room: two swastika emblems 
hanging on opposite walls, a pail 
of red liquid beside the desk, 
three circles and a hexagon 
drawn on the floor with chalk, a 
pile of dry soil on the Old Man’s 
blotter. Outside of that, the office 
was pretty normal, unless you 
include the fifty or sixty mirrors 
of assorted sizes and shapes that 
decorated the walls. 

Warhead spied a movement in 
one of the mirrors and almost 
jumped out of his boots. He 
caught a grip on himself, how- 
ever, when he realized it was 
only his own reflection. 

I wanted to ask him what all 
the gimmicks were for. But it 
was just possible that conditions 
on Darian and Wellborne were 
identical, and if I let anybody see 
I was confused by what I was 
running into here, they might 



176 



GALAXY 



realize I had never been on Well- 
borne. 

My best bet was to go on 
pretending familiarity with any- 
thing that happened and keeping 
my eyes open until I learned 
enough to get by on. 

66 AS I WAS saying,” the 
Skipper resumed, “we’re 
getting strong hyperterminal em- 
anations up there. The Wispies 
should have all coordinates 
zeroed in for breakthrough by to- 
morrow. I’m going ■ to send you 
out with Lieutenant Barlow, 
Captain Randell and a plug-up 
detail. I expect you to give them 
a lot of pointers on Wispie 
fighting.” 

The Old Man took another 
anxious look over his shoulder 
and I went back to aiming my 
nose here and there, sniffing, try- 
ing to pin down the pungent 
scent. 

“Ever think of going PM?” he 
asked. 

I hesitated. “What makes you 
ask?” 

“After all, it’s a logical step 
after a man’s already had duty 
in the Wispie sector.” 

“I suppose it is.” 

“With your experience, you’d 
make a hell of a PM man.” 

“That’s what I’ve been told.” 

“I’d sign up myself if I didn’t 
have to hold things together 
around here.” 



I had an idea I was getting the 
soft sell. But several things hap- 
pened in the next instant. 

The lights flickered and dim- 
med, letting the erratic glow of 
flaring lightning flood in through 
the windows. There was a 
whistling moan in the far corner, 
as though a blast of wet wind 
had sneaked inside. And, some- 
where near the groan, a dark 
shadow began swirling like a 
vortex. 

Shouting, the Skipper lunged 
from his chair. “Frankson! Las- 
siter!” 

He seized the end of a rope 
beside his desk and gave it a 
tug. The other end uncoiled from 
around the starter pully of an 
auxiliary generator and the en- 
gine putt-putted to life. 

“Frankson! Lassiter!” he roared 
again. “Damned PM Detail! 
Never around when you need 
them!” 

The generator’s output built 
up and the lights brightened 
again. Power returned to the 
sound-negation system, deaden- 
ing the roar of thunder outside. 
At the same time, the cloud that 
was hovering at the far end of 
the room began swallowing itself 
up in its own vortex. But not 
before a nearby chair did a 
shuddering dance across the floor, 
then hurled itself to destruction 
against the side of the desk. 

Warhead stood there with 



FIGHTING SPIRIT 



177 



perspiration on his forehead. He 
fished a little white sack from 
under his blouse and jiggled it at 
the end of its string. And now 
I was almost choking with the 
scent I couldn’t identify before. 

“Concentrated garlic extract,” 
he explained. “We find it works 
better than anything else. What 
are you using?” 

“I — that is — nothing at the 
moment.” 

He started. “Nothing! Nothing 
at all?’’ 

“I mean — well, I just haven’t 
had a chance to get squared away 
yet and — ” 

“You get down to Supply on 
the double and check out the 
full works! I won’t have any 
man in my command unneces- 
sarily exposed — no matter how 
brave he thinks he is!” 

f I ‘'HE supply clerk was a cocky 
old bird. He was a four- 
striper, meaning only four re- 
enlistments, but the lines on his 
face looked like dozens of years 
of tough service. 

I watched the mound of Fed- 
eration Issue grow on the counter 
as he added to it, item by item: 
a carton of candles sprinkled 
with silver dust, three bags of 
garlic extract, a box of mud, a 
jar of dirty water with larvae 
flipping around in it, two swas- 
tika medallions, an assortment of 
mirrors, mounted and unmounted. 



He produced a gunny sack and 
began shoving the stuff inside. 

“While I’m here,” I inter- 
rupted, “I’d like to check out a 
proton pistol, some anti-person- 
nel grenades and a Mark XIV 
rifle.” The idea was to beef up 
my modest arsenal of one beta- 
zip hand gun, which I had 
brought along from Solarside. 

The noncom reared back. 
“Very funny, sir.” He handed me 
the sack and turned. 

“You have armament, don’t 
you?” 

He slapped a rapid-fire somni- 
dart caster in my hand. This 
was more than I could tolerate. 
On one of the hottest fronts in a 
war that stretched a tenth of the 
way across the local galactic arm, 
he had give me something that 
only produced pleasant dreams 
for a couple of hours! 

The noncom’s rigid expression 
changed slightly. “I can see you’re 
new here, Lieutenant. We got the 
heavy stuff, all right, but it’s for 
those who’s shipping out — or in 
case anybody decides to go PM.” 

Obviously, the PM bunch was 
the only ones who could count 
on adequate self-protection. I 
shouldered the gunny and paused 
in the doorway to adjust my en- 
vironment-control belt : 

Rain shield, full capacity; 
anti-lightning field, maximum 
negativity; capsular light projec- 
tion range, fifteen feet (night

had gotten a good grip on the 
base by now); noise dampener, 
plus eighty-decibel setting to 
keep the thunder from turning 
my ears into kettle drums. 

Without exaggeration, I think 
it might be said that my environ- 
ment regulators were fairly hum- 
ming with activity as I plunged 
back outside. 

I had covered only half the 
distance to the brilliantly glow- 
ing Bachelor Officers Quarters 
when the entire base was sud- 
denly flooded with light. It came 
from two sources: Someone had 
turned up the gas flares, and an 
entire row of maintenance shacks 
was on fire. 

I switched off my capsular 
light generator and watched base 
personnel running all over the 
place. Some were converging on 
a man who lay writhing near the 
center of the drill field. 

“General Quarters! General 
Quarters!” the public address 
system blared. “Man all posts! 
Unassigned personnel take cover! 
Garlic and mirrors are the order 
of the day!” 

I followed a major and a 
sergeant who were racing for the 
injured man. By the time I ar- 
rived there, the sergeant was 
kneeling beside him and a dozen 
other men were crowding around. 

The sergeant swore. “Another 
casualty!” 

“That makes the third one 

FIGHTING SPIRIT 



today,” the major said angrily. 

“There’ll be more before this 
raid’s over.” 

The victim lay on his back, 
lifeless eyes boring skyward, his 
face glistening with raindrops. 
And I found new resolve to bag 
myself a bunch of Wispies. 
Sneak attacks were being pulled 
off on one or two of the more 
remote, primitive fronts. But, for 
the most part, fighting was on an 
honest, out-in-the-open basis. I 
liked it that way — not like this. 

“How’d it happen?” I asked. 

The sergeant peeled back the 
collar and exposed red marks 
left by powerful fingers that had 
choked the life out of the victim. 
Two other noncoms hoisted the 
casualty on a stretcher and bore 
him off. 

“Poor old Fowler,” the ser- 
geant mumbled. “I told him he 
should have gone PM.” 

“Guess he would have,” the 
major said, “if he’d known he 
was going to get it like this.” 

T WAS left alone on the field, 

hail-sized drops testing the 
strength of my shield and 
thunder making the night seem 
like a stomping ground for in- 
visible giants. 

Darkness pressed in on me, 
until I remembered I had turned 
off my light projector. I flicked 
it on again. The wind moaned 
close to my ear but I ignored it 

179 






— till I realized that, for a 
change, there was no wind 
blowing. 

I moved off toward BOQ and 
something cold and sticky slap- 
ped me across the neck. When I 
turned, nothing was there. I went 
faster and ran into a tangle of 
dry cobwebs. Dry cobwebs — in 
this weather? 

Lurching through the invisible 
barrier, I plunged on to BOQ 
and took the steps two at a time, 
hurling myself against the door. 
It opened easily and I was in 
a vast room that didn’t at all 
resemble a conventional Bache- 
lor Officers Quarters layout. 
Steel bars sliced the space into 
cubicles that were furnished with 
satin-canopied beds, contour 
chairs and piled carpets. 

Each cell contained a tall, 
lean, fur-covered thing with a 
sad, naked face full of wrinkles. 
They were bipeds and had pre- 
hensile hands. 

Soft music played and scores 
of entertainment screens sent 
their flickering light out in all 
directions. A Medical Corps 
captain went from cell to cell 
passing out fruit from a silver 
bowl. 

He reached where I was stand- 
ing and said, “You’re the new 
man from Wellborne, aren’t you?” 

I only continued staring at the 
hairy things. 

“Got to keep ’em satisfied, you 



know,” he said, nodding toward 
his charges. 

“Damned right,” I said, won- 
dering what they were. 

The medical officer satisfied 
my curiosity. “I think it may be 
safely said that I keep the hap- 
piest compound of Wispies in 
this entire sector. How do these 
facilities compare with those on 
Wellborne?” 

“Why — no comparison at all.” 

It was an ambiguous answer, 
but not to him. He took it with 
a proud grin. 

The door opened and an eld- 
erly but rugged-looking civilian 
in a trenchcoat barged in and 
stood shaking the water off his 
sleeves. An arm band identified 
him as a member of the Press 
Corps. 

“All right, Doc,” he said, “I’ve 
got a portable translator. Now 
how’s about me interviewing that 
latest batch of prisoners?” 

“Not on your life,” the captain 
answered. “They’re in the best of 
spirit. I want them to stay that 
way.” 

The correspondent swore, 
looked at me for sympathy, then 
smiled. “You the guy from Well- 
borne?” 

I recognized him. “You’re 
Starhop Stanton.” 

“That’s right, Dykes. Maybe I 
can squeeze some copy out of 
you. How’s about it?” 

I wasn’t quite sure whether he 



180 



GALAXY 



rated a handshake or a stiff boot 
to his posterior. You see, he was 
partly responsible for my being 
on Darian. 

His clustercasts usually rang 
with emotion, sure to raise the 
fighting spirit in any man. I can 
even remember the particular 
’cast — his first from Darian — 
that had set me on fire. All about 
“a real man’s front” where the 
“most courageous warriors in the 
noble history of mankind” face 
the “severest challenge imagin- 
able.” 

Technically, it wasn’t a good 
videocast. Too much interstellar 
interference and signal fading. 
But one bit came through clear 
enough to raise goosebumps and 
send me out waving the flag. It 
was something about “the Feder- 
ation’s bravest heroes” being 
“hunted relentlessly by the most 
treacherous foe we have ever 
known.” 

“I said I’d like to try to milk 
some copy out of you,” he re- 
peated. “The folks back home, 
you know, are eager to hear — ” 

“I’m going out on patrol to- 
morrow. Maybe right after I get 
back — ” 

“Fine! I’ll corner you then.” 

i"|UTSIDE, someone grabbed 
”my arm. “Thought I saw you 
duck in there. I’m Randell — 
Rusty Randell.” 

Projecting a blaze of capsular 



illumination, he was stockily 
built and had a pleasant face. 
The three small mirrors and two 
sacks of garlic extract that were 
strung around his neck almost hid 
his captain’s bars. 

“I’m going out with you and 
Barlow in the morning,” he ex- 
plained. 

“You suppose we’ll get us any 
Wispies?” I asked. 

“They’ll be there to get, all 
right. I was wondering — maybe 
you can tell me something about 
powdered snails.”. 

We headed for a smaller, 
darkened building off to the left. 

“Powdered what?” 

“Snails — crushed, dried — 
instead of garlic. I hear you fel- 
lows did wonders with it over 
on Wellborne.” 

“Oh, not too bad.” The “oh” 
signified disappointment, real dis- 
appointment. I had just been try- 
ing to decide whether to tell 
him I had never been on Well- 
borne. He looked friendly enough 
to take me under his wing until 
I got my feet on the ground. 

But now he was saying, “Damn! 
Am I ever glad to draw an old 
veteran of Wispie warfare like 
you! Dykes, I feel safe now for 
the first time since I got here.” 

Supper in Officers’ Mess was 
almost uneventful. Randell and 
I had the place to ourselves, 
practically, since I had been de- 
layed checking in. 



FIGHTING SPIRIT 



181 



Near the end of the meal, a 
bowl half full of soup floated off 
a tray as it was being carried 
back to the galley. The mess boy 
ducked, but not in time. He 
came up with the bowl inverted 
on his head and its contents 
dripping down his face. 

Later, four chairs in a corner 
started a thumping dance that 
didn’t end until one of the tables 
shot up to the ceiling and slam- 
med down on top of them. 

Randell took it all with an 
occasional wince or dodge, when- 
ever appropriate, but offered no 
comment. 

I was beginning to figure out 
some of the answers for myself. 
Suppose, for instance, the Wispies 
had some way of exerting force 
over a distance. Get what I 
mean? They could play hell 
with our morale. 

Old Warhead Mason must 
have been really sold on this idea 
of teaming me with Randell and 
Barlow. When we finally reached 
BOQ, I found he had given the 
three of us bunks together in 
one corner of the (I started to 
say “room,” but I’d better use 
the more appropriate word) 
building. 

No individual rooms with all 
the latest gimmicks and conven- 
iences. Instead, the barnlike 
quarters had stud-bare walls 
with black building paper show- 
ing between the two-by-fours 



and siding. The floor sagged and 
buckets placed here and there 
took care of the roof leaks. 

Randell cuffed me on the 
shoulder and said, “I’ll bet you 
didn’t have anything like this on 
Wellborne, eh, Dykes?” The sug- 
gestion was that I ought to be 
thankful for the improvement. 
He was dead serious, too. 

T^IGHT or ten other officers 
were already asleep when 
Randell and I crawled into our 
sacks. Just then Barlow came in. 

He kicked one of the pails 
and showered us with rain water. 
Then he propped his foot on my 
bunk and began unzipping his 
jacket. “So here’s the guy who’s 
going to show us how to fight 
Wispies.” 

“Ignore him, Dykes,” Randell 
told me. “He’s naturally cynical.” 

Barlow kicked out at the leg 
of my bed. “I hear he doesn’t put 
much stock in garlic and mirrors. 
Tell us why, Dykes.” 

«J » 

Randell came to my rescue. 
“Simple, Barlow. Nothing to it. 
If we keep our eyes and ears 
open instead of our mouths, 
we might learn something.” 

Dropping his boots on the 
floor, the lieutenant kicked them 
into the corner. “Well, he’ll have 
to show me.” 

“Barlow just signed up for the 
PM Detail,” Randell offered, by 






182 



GALAXY 



way of explaining Barlow’s ill 
temper. 

This took Barlow’s attention 
off me. “Just had my P-I ses- 
sion.” 

“Haw’d it go?” the captain 
asked. 

“Checked in with a point two 
rating and came out with a PM 
quotient of eighty-three point 
six.” 

“Is that good?” 

“Good? Watch.” Barlow 
pinched his nose and the covers 
on his bed folded back all by 
themselves. The pillow rose, 
fluffed itself and floated down 
again. 

“Of course,” he added, “I won’t 
be able to use more than a frac- 
tion of the potential until I get 
squared away in full PM 
status.” 

I always figured that if you 
pay attention and keep at it, 
you can dope out almost any- 
thing. A lot of this PM stuff, for 
instance, was starting to make 
sense. 

When you’re up against an 
enemy that can exert force over 
a distance, wouldn’t you try to 
duplicate that talent among your 
own men? 

If this PM deal gave you that 
sort of training, it sounded like 
pretty good duty. Maybe I’d 
even have a shot at it myself — 
after I brought down a few 
Wispies the orthodox way. 



TJANDELL dug an elbow into 
-*-*-his pillow and made a prop 
for his chin. “You get rated on 
Wellborne, Dykes?” 

I nodded. “Point three five.” 
“That’s pretty damned good!” 
Barlow crawled into bed and 
sounded off with a skeptical 
grunt. “What difference does it 
make? He’ll never go PM.” 
“That’s what you think,” the 
captain shot back. “I got it 
straight from Warhead that 
Dykes might join the detail.” 
Evidently the Skipper had put 
words into my mouth. 

“What about it, Dykes?” Bar- 
low challenged. “My money says 
you’ll never stick your neck out 
for that detail.” 

“Oh, I don’t know,” I said. “I 
just might at that.” 

“Real brave guy, huh?” 

But Randell gave me a re- 
spectful glance. “Well, PM’s not 
for me. I want to get home again 
when this is all over.” 

Abruptly a crackling sound 
came from the decibel dampener 
on the far wall. As smoke curled 
up out of the box, the sonic 
shield gave way and the tireless, 
roaring thunder crashed in on us. 

One of the beds began bounc- 
ing around, hopping first on two 
legs, then on the other two. It 
spilled its startled occupant and 
slammed half through the wall, 
wedging itself among the studs 
and splintered weatherboards. 



FIGHTING SPIRIT 



183 




Barlow lunged up and threw 
a switch. Somewhere outside a 
siren immediately began wailing 
into the storm. 

Now BOQ was a bedlam, with 
everyone scurrying around try- 
ing to escape entanglement in 
the sheets and blankets that 
were flying through the air. 

Confounded, I sat up and 
watched — until I realized my 
own bed was swaying ominously. 
I gripped the springs and held 
on as the floor shot away below. 
I did a poor job of dodging a 
rafter in the way of my head. 

When I came to, things 
seemed to have quieted down 
somewhat. But the room was 
still a beehive. Two of the of- 
ficers, each with a bowl of dirty 
water, were rushing around 
sprinkling the corners and walls. 
A third was embedding two 
crossed candles in their own 
melted wax on the table. An- 
other lay on the floor rolling 
from side to side and groaning 
while a Medical Corpsman ap- 
plied a splint to his leg. 

In the center of the room, an 
officer and a group of enlisted 
men were swinging mirrors and 
using spray guns to fill the air 
with a fog that stank of garlic. 
A PM Detail, no doubt. I ga- 
thered that much because their 
efforts seemed to be directed 
toward a patch of greenish-white 
haze that lurked in the shadows 

185 



up there among the rafters. 

“You okay, Dykes?” Barlow 
bent over my caved-in bed and 
looked down at me. 

I rubbed my head. “I doubt 
if my helmet will fit for a while.” 

The special detail officer 
turned toward Randell. “That’s 
the best we can do for you 
tonight.” 

“Think we’ll have any more 
trouble?” 

“Not much chance of it. We’ve 
got the place pretty well roped 
off and stunk up.” 

They sprayed a bit longer, 
then left. 

We all hit the sack, but I 
didn’t do much sleeping. Instead, 
I spent the rest of the night as- 
suring myself that the greenish- 
white shadow wasn’t coming any 
closer. 

"E’ARLY the next morning we 
^ rode a negativized floater up 
through the storm, broke out of 
the basic overcast at fifteen 
thousand feet and headed for a 
towering slope whose peak was 
hidden in a still higher cloud 
layer. It was dry, though, and 
there was no snow or ice. 

Randell steered the floater 
down to a barren slope, cluttered 
with boulders, crags and scrub 
growth and sliced by ravines and 
crevasses. 

We landed next to a group of 
men gathered around a field- 



piece that looked formidable 
enough to hurl a planetbuster 
into orbit. I felt relieved. Here, 
finally, was evidence that we did 
go after Wispies with something 
more lethal than a somnidart 
caster. 

Randell led one squad off the 
floater and Barlow took another. 
I followed, looking disdainfully 
down at my dart caster in its 
holster and feeling more satisfied 
with the bulge of the beta-zip 
hand gun under my jacket. 

We reached the fieldpiece and 
everybody crowded around the 
captain. 

“What’s the situation?” Ran- 
dell asked. 

“We’re getting peak readings 
from between those two 
boulders,” a sergeant reported, 
pointing. “Breakthrough ought 
to come in ten or fifteen minutes.” 

Something tugged at my leg 
and I kicked out in reflex. But 
nothing was there. One of the 
enlisted men, too, was having a 
little trouble. He kept slapping 
his face as though trying to swat 
an invisible fly. A corporal fin- 
ally handed him a mirror and he 
stood staring at his reflection 
and radiating relief. 

“We have with us,” Randell 
announced, “Lieutenant Kenneth 
Dykes, fresh from mixing it up 
with Wispies on Wellborne.” 

All eyes turned respectfully 
toward me.

GALAXY 



“A real hero,” Barlow added 
scathingly out of the side of his 
mouth. His foot lashed idly out 
at a rock and it went clattering 
down the slope. 

“Since we have a few minutes 
before deploying,” Randell went 
on, “the lieutenant will give us a 
few pointers on taking care of 
Wispies.” 

I squinted at the big gun’s 
control board and saw there 
were no conventional knobs and 
levers — only a few toggles and 
a score of calibrated dials. Evi- 
dently it wasn’t a fieldpiece at 
all, but some kind of detecting 
instrument! 

“Lieutenant Dykes,” Randell 
prompted. 

I started. “I — ah, that is — 
yes?” 

“I said you were going to give 
us some pointers.” 

“Oh, sure. The first thing to 
remember is — no, wait — sup- 
pose you go ahead and take care 
of this breakthrough as usual. 
We’ll have an evaluation session 
afterward and I’ll tell you how 
we would have done it on Well- 
borne.” 

“Sounds like a good idea,” 
Randell commented. 

SOMETHING slimy stung me 
k -' across the face and I stag- 
gered back, tripped and fell. I 
rolled down the slope, checked 
my momentum and tried to get 



up. But I was suddenly choking 
in a swirling cloud of moist dust 
that was going into orbit about 
my head. 

Round and round it went, 
trailing a streamer of haze that 
fell against my neck, loop after 
loop. The coils tightened and I 
couldn’t breathe. On one knee, I 
tore at my collar, coughing. 

Then somebody was sprin- 
kling dirty brown water in my 
face and several other medics 
were dangling garlic bags all 
around my head. 

“What the hell, Dykes!” Ran- 
dell said. “Aren’t you using 
anything?” 

“Of course not.” Barlow folded 
his arms and glowered down at 
me. “He left his security gear in 
his locker. You did, didn’t you, 
Dykes?” 

I feigned a few unnecessary 
coughs to keep from having to 
answer. 

“What would a fearless vet- 
eran of Wispie warfare need 
with security gear?” Barlow 
mocked. 

Someone slipped a garlic bag 
around my neck. “You’d better 
use this, sir.” 

The indicator that looked like 
a fieldpiece started buzzing. 

“Breakthrough!” snapped the 
sergeant. 

“Into squads — form!” Ran- 
dell ordered. “Dykes, you stick 
with Barlow and his men. I’ll be 



FIGHTING SPIRIT 



187 



floating around from squad to 
squad.” 

Barlow held up a clenched fist 
and his men formed around him. 
“We’ll take up positions behind 
that outcropping over there. 
Come on, Dykes, let’s go; we’ll 
see what you can do.” 

I had to hand it to him — he 
had guts, all right. He moved off 
leisurely, kicked a rock, followed 
it, kicked it again and went after 
it once more. When we reached 
the outcropping, the rest of his 
squad had already taken cover. 
Somnidart guns drawn, they 
faced the clearing between the 
two boulders and stiffened. 

A tiny point of violet light, 
suspended in the air, was ra- 
pidly expanding into a sphere. 
When it reached twenty feet in 
diameter, the first Wispie came 
through. His dark brown fur 
contrasting the sparkling color 
of the sphere, he carried a 
tubular weapon and dived for 
cover in a fissure. 

I tensed, but Barlow laid a 
hand on my arm. “We always let 
a few of them through before we 
cut loose. Wait for the captain’s 
signal.” 

For once I had forgotten all 
my other difficulties. I wasn’t 
even concerned that the invisible 
something was back again, tug- 
ging at my boot this time. All 
that mattered was that at last I 
was in a man’s war, ready to 



start bringing down my share of 
Wispies. 

Eight more furry things poured 
out of the sphere and dashed 
for cover. Barlow drew his somni- 
dart caster, apparently expecting 
Randell’s signal, and centered 
one of the running figures in his 
sights. 

I fumbled under my jacket, 
found the beta-zip gun and 
lunged out from behind the out- 
cropping. I dropped to one knee 
and took aim. 

“Hey, Dykes!” cried Barlow. 
“What the hell are you doing?” 

He hit me with a shoulder 
block and we both went tumbl- 
ing down the slope. 

Between rolls, he grunted, 
“You trying — to hurt — one 
of those — things?” 

HPHEN the ground was boiling 
and smoking as fierce lances 
of white light exploded all 
around us. We came to rest 
against another outcropping and 
I saw that the Wispies stream- 
ing out of the sphere were cut- 
ting loose with all the firepower 
they had. 

Barlow pulled me behind a 
slanting slab while the air sang 
with both the gentle woosh of 
darts and the crack of enemy 
weapons. Wispies were falling 
all over the place. But so were 
some of our own men. 

By this time I had my dart 



188 



GALAXY 



gun out too, since I’d lost my 
beta-zip somewhere on the slope. 
But I couldn’t see if I was scor- 
ing any hits. 

A few minutes later Randell 
came scurrying up to us. “What 
happened over here?” 

“This veteran,” Barlow said, 
jerking a thumb in my direction, 
“tried to crack down on a Wispie 
with a beta-zip.” 

“The hell he did!” Randell’s 
eyes bulged. “You out of your 
mind, Dykes?” 

“I only tried — ” 

SOMEBODY blew a whistle 
^ across the way. 

“We got ’em contained!” the 
captain exclaimed, scampering 
off. “Spread out and start mop- 
ping up.” 

“We’re lucky this time,” Bar- 
low shot back. “Not a single 
casualty — so far.” 

He must have been blind. 
From where I stood I could 
count four men dead and three 
wounded. There were Wispies 
lying all over the battlefield. 
But, after the dart juice wore off, 
they’d be all right. 

“Stay here and keep out of 
trouble.” Barlow trotted away. 
“We’ll pick you up later.” 

Then, in the next instant, I 
was fighting off a net of coarse, 
sticky cobwebs that I couldn’t 
even see. A swirling cloud of 
shadows a few feet off to my 



left began growing darker and 
inching closer. 

I clutched the garlic bag and 
jiggled it desperately in front of 
my face. But something had me 
by the leg and was dragging me 
off down the slope. I didn’t even 
look to see what it was because 
I knew it wouldn’t be there. 

Shouting, I anchored myself 
to a rock and tried to kick my 
leg free. But my left foot was 
caught up in another invisible 
grip and I hung there, half sus- 
pended above the ground, with 
my legs spread wide and my 
arms outstretched to hold on to 
the rock. The swirling shadow 
bored closer, whistling and groan- 
ing all the time. 

With a frenzied kick, I 
wrenched my legs loose and 
scurried back up the slope. When 
I cut around a boulder, however, 
I practically ran over three 
Wispies who were firing on an 
advancing squad of Corpsmen. 

I bowled two of them over, 
knocking them loose from their 
weapons, as the third whirled 
and fired a blast just past my 
head. I scrambled to one side 
and my hand struck one of their 
guns. I came up with it and 
brought it around in a parrying 
thrust. But the thing went off 
and its shaft of white light bored 
a hole through the chest of the 
still-armed Wispie. With the tube 
spitting out a steady stream of 



FIGHTING SPIRIT 



189 



fiery hell, I turned it on the 
other two furry things before 
they could reach me. 

Then darts were singing 
through the air from all direc- 
tions. One of them got me in 
the shoulder and I crumpled 
where I stood. 

“Damn it!” I heard Barlow’s 
voice, fading fast. “He got some 
Wispies after all!” 

“Maybe they aren’t dead yet,” 
Randall said hopefully, just be- 
fore I passed out. “Call the 
medics! Get an ambulance sled!” 

T^ROM the edge of wakefulness, 
■*" I was again aware of voices on 
either side of me. 

“He’s all right, sir,” Lieutenant 
Barlow said crisply. “I had to 
put him out with a dart.” 

“I don’t understand.” I recog- 
nized Colonel Mason’s voice. 
The Old Man added, “He should 
know more about combat tech- 
niques than any of us — he’s 
fresh off Wellborne.” 

This time it was Captain Ran- 
dell who spoke, in a grating whis- 
per that was full of alarm. “He 
plugged three Wispies!” 

“Dead?” 

I flicked an eyelid open in 
time to see Randell and Barlow, 
on one side of my bed, nodding. 

“Oh, no!” Old Warhead ex- 
ploded. “That does it! Those are 
the casualties that’ll break our 
back!” 



“We lost seven men out of the 
plug-up detail,” Randell said, 
“and brought back six wounded.” 

But Colonel Mason only held 
his head in his hands. “Three 
Wispie casualties! Of all the rot- 
ten luck! Call out the PM vol- 
unteers! Let’s get things rolling 
before we’re knocked on our 
butts!” 

He glanced down and saw I 
was awake and sputtered. 
“Dykes! You’re supposed to be 
an experienced man from Well- 
borne. What in hell ever pos- 
sessed you?” 

Either I had to carry out my 
bluff even more convincingly 
than before, or I had to confess 
that my orders had been rigged. 
But if I made a clean breast of 
everything, then I’d spend the 
rest of the war on a prison 
planet, and my friend in Person- 
nel would be right there with 
me. 

Barlow sneered. “Maybe he 
just got reckless. Or maybe he de- 
cided to go PM.” 

It was only a straw, but I 
grabbed it. “That’s right, Skipper. 
The whole idea was to get on the 
PM Detail.” 

Warhead backed off, eyed me 
skeptically, then broke out in a 
smile. “Oh -ho! Now I see why 
you did it. Dykes, my hat’s off 
to you.” He turned to Randell. 
“How about that? The boy’s got 
real fighting spirit, hasn’t he?” 



190 



GALAXY 



The captain nodded in awe. 
“I’ve never seen anything like it.” 
“You realize of course, Dykes, 
that once you take the P-I treat- 
ment you can’t back down,” the 
Old Man reminded me soberly. 
“We couldn’t afford the waste.” 
I answered with an indifferent 
shrug. “A soldier’s duty tran- 
scends everything else, sir.” 
There was respect even in 
Barlow’s stare. “Guess I had you 
figured wrong, Dykes. But, I 
don’t know — ” he shuddered 
“ — killing three Wispies . 

He glanced down at a wad of 
paper on the floor, kicked it to- 
ward the door, overtook it, 
kicked it into the hall, caught 
up with it again, and booted it 
down the corridor. 

Warhead gripped my arm. “If 
there’s anything, anything at all, 
I can do for you, just let me 
know — in time, I mean.” 

He leaned out into the hall 
and shouted, “Orderly! Come 
take Lieutenant Dykes down to 
Psyche Intensification. He’s go- 
ing PM.” 

T WAS somewhat disappointed 
in the P-I Lab. A medical 
major said something about 
“strengthening hell” out of my 
psyche and making it as “razor- 
sharp, artificially, as any Wispie’s 
is naturally.” Then he stabbed 
me in the arm. 

When I came to, there were 



no after-effects. In a casual tone, 
I asked: “Does this make me a 
full-fledged PM?” 

The major slapped me on the 
back and guffawed. “Boy! What 
a joker! Does that make him a 
full-fledged PM! What nonchal- 
ance!” 

When he finished laughing, 
he said, “See if you can pick me 
up.” 

I grabbed him around the 
waist. 

“No, no.” He started laughing 
again. “The other way.” 

This time I understood. I 
pinched the bridge of my nose 
and, through slotted eyelids, 
watched him shoot toward the 
ceiling as though caught up in a 
cyclone. 

“Enough!” he cried. 

And I let him down gently. 

“Dykes,” he said, “you’ve really 
got it! You’re going to do a 
slam-bang job when all the dis- 
tractions are cut off. The Skipper 
wants to see you on the field in 
front of his office. They’re going 
to activate the new PM Detail 
right away. We’ve got some 
Wispie-Bs to take care of, you 
know.” 

For once it wasn’t raining out- 
side. Oh, the sky was as dismal 
as ever, with great rolling black 
clouds dogging one another from 
horizon to horizon, but the light- 
ning and thunder seemed to have 
retreated momentarily, leaving 



FIGHTING SPIRIT 



191 



a drill field with its puddles 
peacefully reflecting the light of 
the gas flares. 

Colonel Mason had the base 
complement drawn up in block 
formation and standing at parade 
rest — commissioned officers on 
his right and noncoms and en- 
listed men on his left. 

It appeared to be a solemn 
occasion, for the men were un- 
covered and had their heads 
bowed — all except a squad 
that stood by itself off to one 
side. 

I started across the field to 
join them, but was overtaken by 
a slim figure in a trenchcoat. It 
was Starhop Stanton, the war 
correspondent. 

“Just heard about your going 
PM,” he said, falling in step. 
“Congratulations. You got a lot of 
guts.” 

I was beginning to feel better 
about volunteering for the special 
detail. It certainly seemed to 
carry prestige with it. 

“I’ve got you to thank for my 
being over here in the first 
place,” I explained. “If it hadn’t 
been for your clustercast about 
the ‘Federation’s bravest heroes’ 
being ‘hunted relentlessly by the 
most treacherous foe,’ I might 
not have risen to the challenge.” 

He paused in midstride, con- 
fused and frowning. 

I went ahead, covering the re- 
maining distance on the double, 



and drew up before the Old Man 
with a brisk salute. 

He returned it and asked, “You 
ready, Dykes?” 

“Yes, sir,” I assured him. 
“We’re going to activate the new 
PM Detail?” 

“Right, son. We can’t gamble 
away any more time.” 

He turned to face the men, 
almost stumbled over a rock, re- 
gained his balance and shouted, 
“Company, ’ten-shun!” 

They snapped to and I won- 
dered what I was supposed to do. 

“PM volunteers, front and 
center!” Mason ordered. 

Barlow and a sublieutenant 
came forward, together with 
three candidates from the en- 
listed men’s ranks. They lined 
up abreast of me and drew erect. 

“Men,” Mason said, “it would 
be impossible for me to ade- 
quately express the appreciation 
of this base and the entire Feder- 
ation for what you are about to 
do.” 

SOMEWHERE in the distance 
^ a drum began rolling softly. 
Starhop Stanton stood in the 
background, looking at me. His 
arms were folded and he was 
shaking his head slowly. 

And I noticed the sublieutenant 
next to me was fidgeting and 
sweating. 

“Actually,” Colonel Mason 
went on, “we hadn’t planned on 



192 



GALAXY 



activating this new PM Detail 
just yet. But there were those 
three Wispie casualties — ” 

He laughed and glanced at me 
— “which Lieutenant Dykes here 
arranged, I’m sure, as a personal 
challenge to himself — ” 

He became sober again — 
“and two more Wispies managed 
to commit suicide. So I don’t 
have to spell out the absolute 
necessity.” 

The sublieutenant screamed, 
“I won’t do it! I changed my 
mind!” 

He broke and tried to run. 
But there were two guards wait- 
ing behind him. They grabbed 
his arms and held him. 

Mason stared pityingly at the 
man. “Son, you can’t change your 
mind. It’s too late.” 

Starhop Stanton drew up be- 
hind me. “About that cluster- 
cast,” he explained, “I didn’t say 
our heroes were being ‘hunted 
relentlessly.’ If you’d been on 
Wellborne, you’d have known 
that I said they were being 
‘haunted relentlessly.’ ” 

Before I could turn, the 
colonel signaled for silence. 
“We’d best get this over with in 
a hurry.” He was still looking 
sympathetically at the sub- 
lieutenant. “Lieutenant Barlow, 



I believe you have the first 
honor.” 

The drum rolled more urgently 
and Barlow took five steps to 
the side and three forward. 
There were several sharp, metal- 
lic clicks — like gun bolts being 
drawn — and I jerked my head 
toward the squad that was off 
to itself. They were armed with 
Mark XIV rifles! 

Just as I turned, confounded, 
back toward Barlow, the eight 
weapons went off and Barlow 
collapsed. 

Colonel Mason produced a 
small ledger and an electro- 
scriber from his pocket. He 
touched the electrode to his 
tongue so it would conduct a 
stronger charge, then inscribed a 
single check mark on the paper. 

“Lieutenant Stephen Barlow, 
ICC,” he announced, “officially 
and permanently transferred to 
the Post-Mortem Detail.” 

Then he gazed into the dis- 
tance and saluted. “Good counter- 
haunting, Barlow.” 

And the rock Mason had 
stumbled over earlier hurled it- 
self forward ten paces, came to 
rest, waited, hurled itself forward 
another ten paces and came to 
rest again.
